For
the first time, extended nanostructured catalysts are demonstrated
with both high specific activity (>6000 μA cmPt–2 at 0.9 V) and high surface areas (>90 m2 gPt–1). Platinum–nickel
(Pt—Ni)
nanowires, synthesized by galvanic displacement, have previously produced
surface areas in excess of 90 m2 gPt–1, a significant breakthrough in and of itself for extended surface
catalysts. Unfortunately, these materials were limited in terms of
their specific activity and durability upon exposure to relevant electrochemical
test conditions. Through a series of optimized postsynthesis steps,
significant improvements were made to the activity (3-fold increase
in specific activity), durability (21% mass activity loss reduced
to 3%), and Ni leaching (reduced from 7 to 0.3%) of the Pt—Ni
nanowires. These materials show more than a 10-fold improvement in
mass activity compared to that of traditional carbon-supported Pt
nanoparticle catalysts and offer significant promise as a new class
of electrocatalysts in fuel cell applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
commercial impact of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs)
is limited in part by the catalyst cost, as the catalyst layer can
account for as much as half of the fuel cell cost.1,2 Catalyst
development typically focuses on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
at the cathode, as ORR in acidic environments is 6 orders of magnitude
slower kinetically than the hydrogen oxidation reaction. PEMFCs typically
use carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/HSC) as the ORR catalyst.
Pt/HSC is commonly used due to its high surface area but has limitations
in site-specific activity and durability. In durability, Pt nanoparticles
are prone to surface area loss through aggregation, Ostwald ripening,
and dissolution, whereas the carbon support is susceptible to corrosion/particle
detachment.3−5 Extended surface catalysts offer the potential to
dramatically improve both site-specific activity and durability, key
limitations for the current commercial catalysts.

To guide ORR
catalyst development, the United States Department
of Energy (DOE) has a 2020 target for mass activity of 440 mA mgPGM–1 at 0.9 V (Pt group metal, PGM, basis).
The DOE target is intended for activity determined in fuel cells.
Activities measured in fuel cells are susceptible to losses from mass
transport and resistance (electronic and ionic); therefore, rotating
disc electrode (RDE) measurements are used as screening tools to determine
the inherent catalyst activity. The evaluation of activity in RDE
half-cells, however, by itself does not ensure similar performance
in fuel cells. This study relies on RDE experiments to show the potential
of materials in an effort to focus on their fundamental electrocatalytic
properties without the complicating factors of fuel cell performance
through optimized membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs).

A number
of researchers have correlated Pt-ORR activity to Pt—OH
and Pt—O binding, suggesting that Pt alloys can offer ORR performance
improvements beyond Pt-only catalysts.6−9 Alloying Pt with other elements has been
found to offer activity improvements, and Pt-nickel (Ni) has been
investigated in a number of forms, experimentally confirming the modeled
alloy benefit.9−18 Work within Pt—Ni has included nanoparticle development by
a variety of methods, alloyed and dealloyed, to produce Pt skins and
skeletons.19−24 In several cases, developed electrocatalysts have produced ORR activities
significantly higher than Pt nanoparticles and the DOE-MEA target
in RDE half-cells.

Extended thin films generally offer high
site-specific activities,
often an order of magnitude greater than nanoparticle catalysts.25−27 Extended nanostructures have also shown improved long-term durability
when exposed to potential cycling. A highly recognized example of
extended surface Pt-ORR catalysts is 3M’s nanostructured thin
films, which have shown high activity and durability.28,29 Although improvements to ORR mass activity have occurred through
large increases in site-specific activity, extended surface catalysts
have traditionally been limited by low surface areas, on the order
of 10 m2 gPt–1 from various
synthesis techniques.28,30,31 Low-surface-area catalysts are of concern not
only due to lost potential mass activity but also due to contaminants,
as well as at high current density, where local mass transport resistances
can become significant.32,33 Although extended surface
electrocatalysts show great promise, they have been limited by the
low surface areas they have achieved.

We have previously used
galvanic displacement to deposit thin Pt
layers onto extended nanostructures and demonstrated a dramatic increase
in the Pt surface areas of extended surface electrocatalysts (>90
m2 gPt–1).27,34−37 These materials, however, suffered from moderate specific activity
and were prone to performance loss and Ni dissolution. Postsynthesis
processing parameters, including thermal treatment under reducing
and oxidizing conditions and acid leaching to selectively remove Ni,
have been optimized to significantly improve the site-specific activity
without appreciably impacting the surface area. The resulting materials
also minimized durability performance losses, including activity and
Ni dissolution. The results of these studies represent the first example
of extended surface materials with both exceptionally high specific
activity (>6000 μA cmPt–2) and
exceptionally high surface area (>90 m2 gPt–1).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Hydrogen Anneal
Pt—Ni nanowires
were annealed in hydrogen at select temperatures in an attempt to
improve incorporation of Ni into the Pt phase, thereby offering site-specific
activity advantages due to alloying effects.8,11 Compared
with the as-synthesized catalyst, annealing in hydrogen to 250 °C
produced a 3-fold specific activity increase in RDE half-cells (Figures 1 and S1–S3). The largest increase in specific
activity was observed between 200 and 250 °C; at higher temperatures,
more incremental improvements were found. Although increasing the
annealing temperature improved the specific activity, the ORR mass
activity reached a peak value of 5200 mA mgPt–1 at 250 °C and decreased at higher annealing temperatures (Figure 1). This decline was
due to surface area loss, which could be rationalized in terms of
reordering and aggregation of Pt at the surface, and a loss of surface
roughness was observed in microscopic analysis (Figures 2 and S4–S6).

Figure 1 (a) ORR mass (red) and site-specific (blue) activities of Pt—Ni
nanowires (7.3 ± 0.3 wt % Pt) annealed in hydrogen at 0.9 V vs
RHE. The activities of the as-synthesized Pt—Ni nanowires were
included at 0 °C. The solid red line and dashed blue line were

ORR activities of Pt—Ni nanowires annealed in hydrogen before
(initial) and after durability (durability). Horizontal lines were
included for the mass (red) and site-specific (blue) activities of
Pt/HSC after durability testing. Durability consisted of 30 000
cycles in the potential range of 0.6–1.0 V vs RHE in 0.1 M
perchloric acid. ORR activities were taken during anodic polarization
scans at 20 mV s–1 and 1600 rpm and were corrected
for internal resistance and mass transport.

as-synthesized; annealed in hydrogen to 250 and 400 °C; annealed
in hydrogen to 250 °C and ex situ acid-leached (A1, N1, N3);
and annealed in hydrogen to 250 °C, ex situ acid-leached (N1),
and annealed in oxygen to 175 °C.

Incorporation of Ni in the Pt phase was confirmed with X-ray
absorption
spectroscopy at the near-edge (XANES) and the extended region (EXAFS, Figure 3a,b). The Pt L3 absorption edge corresponded to core electron transitions
from the 2p3/2 orbital to unoccupied states. Hydrogen annealing
decreased the area, likely due to alloyed Ni contributing electrons
to the previously unoccupied Pt orbitals. Parameters derived from
the first-shell fitting of the Fourier-transformed Pt L3 EXAFS spectra provide quantitative structural information (Figure 3b,c). For the as-synthesized
Pt—Ni nanowires, the best fit was achieved with only Pt in
the first shell. After hydrogen annealing to 250 °C, equivalent
amounts of Ni and Pt in the first shell and a compressed Pt—Pt
interatomic distance (−0.05 Å, relative to the as-synthesized
nanowires) were required for the fit. Only Pt—Ni bonding is
evident from the fit for the nanowires annealed at 400 °C, with
Ni being the only scattering element in the best fit of the first
shell. The EXAFS results demonstrated incorporation of Ni into the
Pt first shell and established that hydrogen annealing increases mixing
of the Pt and Ni phases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further
confirmed changes in the surface composition, consistent with migration
of Pt into the Ni core. Although no major changes were observed in
the Pt 4f spectra, there is substantial growth of the peak at approximately
852.5 eV due to an increase in the metallic Ni species near the nanowire
surface (Figure 3d,e).

from the EXAFS fits for the Pt—Ni nanowires, including the
coordination numbers (N), absorber-scattering atoms,
interatomic distance (R), sigma squared (σ2), and the R-factor.

The specific activities of the Pt—Ni nanowires were
more
than 10 times larger than those of Pt/HSC. Pt—Ni nanowire catalysts
offer potential advantages in site-specific activity, by the extended
surface avoiding low coordinate surface sites and/or reduced particle
size effects.25,26 The increase in specific activity
observed with the hydrogen annealing temperature can be rationalized
as an increased alloying effect, with Ni-induced Pt lattice compression
weakening Pt—O chemisorption.8,11 As discussed
above, the improved mixing of the Pt and Ni phases with the annealing
temperature was confirmed with XANES and EXAFS (Figure 3). Pt lattice compression was probed directly
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), where examination of the Pt(111) reflection
revealed a gradual shift from a characteristically Pt lattice into
a shoulder on the Ni(111) reflection at 500 °C (Figures 4a and S7). Through Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns, the
average Pt lattice constant compressed from 3.911 Å in the as-synthesized
material to 3.551 Å after annealing to 500 °C (Figure S8). Differences in the exposed Pt facets
may have influenced activity but likely did not provide a significant
benefit for the Pt—Ni nanowires. Studies on the redox of adsorbed
germanium and tellurium confirmed a wide distribution of surface Pt
facets; a majority (50–65%), however, were in the {100} set,
previously found to be less active for Pt—Ni alloys (Pt3Ni, Figures 4 and S9).38−42 The distribution of Pt facets was generally consistent
for all Pt—Ni nanowires examined and did not significantly
change with the annealing temperature. In contrast, Pt/HSC contained
more Pt{111} (46.3%) than {100} (26.1%) in comparable tests.

Pt), as-synthesized and annealed in hydrogen. (b) Pt lattice constants
(by Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns) and Pt facet data, as determined

models of Pt skins on the Ni3Pt alloy. All other surface
models and their energies may be found in the Supporting Information section.

The observed Pt facet distribution may not have improved
the ORR
activity. Understanding why the Pt—Ni nanowires contained a
high proportion of Pt{100}, however, was of significant interest,
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to
examine the relative stabilities of the Pt facets and lattices found
in the Pt—Ni nanowires. DFT calculations were completed on
a Pt skin on the Pt—Ni alloys (Ni3Pt and Pt3Ni), on the relevant facets of (100), (110), and (111, Figures 4, S10, and S11, and Tables S1–S3). Calculations were
completed on Ni3Pt and Pt3Ni substructures,
on a single and three Pt overlayers, to give a range of Pt lattices
and bracket the range found in the XRD patterns. Calculations confirmed
that (111) is the most stable surface for the alloys, with >99%
of
exposed facets being (111, Boltzmann distribution). The presence of
a Pt skin, however, resulted in a reordering of facet stabilities.
Specifically, the (100) facet of Ni3Pt with a Pt skin of
three layers was stabilized with cohesive energies comparable to those
of the (111) facet. A lattice constant of 3.62 Å resulted in
cohesive energies of Ecoh (100) = −4.98
and Ecoh (111) = −5.01 eV/atom;
likewise, a lattice of 3.77 Å resulted in Ecoh (100) = −5.03 and Ecoh (111) = −5.06 eV/atom. The alloying effect of Ni3Pt was more pronounced than that of Pt3Ni as the Ni-enriched
alloy particularly stabilizes both (100) ∼ (111) over (110)
with a compressed lattice constant ca. 3.77 Å. This effect may
become more pronounced as the Pt skin grows thicker and may have far-reaching
effects on the electrocatalytic activity exhibited by the high-performer.
Stabilization of the Pt skin on Ni3Pt varied depending
on both skin thickness and the size of the lattice—a single
Pt layer was more stabilized on a sublayer of Ni, whereas a thicker
Pt layer was more stabilized on a sublayer of mixed Pt—Ni.
Although (111) is the most stable surface of face-centered cubic metals
in vacuum, the competitive stability of a Pt skin on (100) Ni3Pt appears to explain how the Pt—Ni nanowires can contain
a high amount of Pt(100) on the surface with a compressed lattice.
The DFT calculations addressed the synthesized catalyst by focusing
on the extended surface and the Ni3Pt substructure to induce
Pt lattice compression. A three-layer Pt skin on (100) Ni3Pt was representative of the high-performing nanowires (hydrogen-annealed,
250 °C), as the lattices approximately matched, and the (100)
facet was dominant electrochemically.

As discussed above, the
hydrogen-annealed samples showed very high
initial activity. Their durability, however, was a concern. Durability
testing was completed in RDE half-cells, by performing 30 000
potential cycles in the range of 0.6–1.0 V versus a reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 500 mV s–1. For the
less-active Pt—Ni nanowires, as-synthesized or annealed to
low temperatures, durability losses were generally modest (Figures 1 and S3). These losses increased at higher annealing
temperatures, however, due to a combination of ECA and specific activity
losses and corresponded to elevated levels of Ni dissolution (Figure S12). XPS data confirmed that annealing
in hydrogen increased the presence of Ni metal (relative to Pt or
Ni hydroxide) near the nanowire surface (Figure 3). The prevalence of the Ni metal likely
resulted in the susceptibility of the nanowires to corrosion and contributed
to higher specific activity losses in durability testing. Although
significant amounts of Ni dissolved during electrochemical conditioning
and durability, microscopic analysis found solid, in-tact nanowires
that remained after electrochemical testing (Figure S13).

The Ni dissolution rates observed were higher than
typical for
Pt—Ni nanoparticles.19 The primary
difference between these systems was the amount of Ni available and
the location of Pt and Ni at the beginning of the annealing process.
The nanowires were Ni dominant (92.7 wt % Ni), with Pt at the outer
layer. Conversely, Pt—Ni nanoparticles were typically more
homogeneous with a lower Ni composition. Although Pt may have a surface
preference over Ni, the Ni/Pt atomic ratio and the initial location
of Pt on the nanowire surface potentially overwhelmed this preference.21,43,44 Intermixing of Pt and Ni may
also have created Ni-dissolution routes, exposing the Ni nanowire
core.

2.2 Acid Leach
As Ni leaching in durability
testing was found to be a concern, ex situ acid exposure was used
to explore the potential impacts of Ni leaching on performance and
durability following the hydrogen annealing step. Annealed Pt—Ni
nanowires were exposed to different acid types, concentrations, and
temperatures to create catalysts with a variety of compositions (Table S4). The results of these studies exposed
general trends on the basis of the acid type (Figures 2 and S14). First,
exposure to acetic acid caused low amounts of Ni removal, primarily
small Ni pockets near the nanowire surface, but did not significantly
impact catalyst morphology. Second, exposure to nitric acid resulted
in moderate amounts of Ni removal, including the partial removal of
the nanowire core. Higher nitric acid concentrations resulted in higher
degrees of Ni removal; many nanowires were broken into shorter segments
(0.5–1 μm), and all of the Ni metal that was not incorporated
within the Pt layers was removed. Third, exposure to sulfuric acid
resulted in the highest degree of Ni removal. A significant portion
of the catalyst was broken into fragments, with few nanowires maintaining
their original morphology.

Ex situ acid leaching of the hydrogen-annealed
Pt—Ni nanowires proved to be effective in improving durability;
these improvements, however, came at the expense of activity (Figures 5 and S15). This trend can be divided into two groups.
Small amounts of Ni removal, using acetic acid or dilute (0.1 M) nitric
acid, maintained Pt lattice compression and high site-specific activity,
but did not dramatically reduce activity losses or Ni dissolution
in durability testing. Large amounts of Ni removal (using more concentrated
nitric acid or sulfuric acid) significantly improved catalyst durability
and minimized Ni dissolution, but resulted in much lower initial specific
activity and was of less interest from an electrocatalyst standpoint
(Figure S16). This drop in initial site-specific
activity could be rationalized as being caused by a dealloying effect,
and XRD confirmed that ex situ acid leaching resulted in a shift of
the Pt lattice from relatively compressed to characteristically Pt
(Figure S17).

Figure 5 (a) ORR mass (red) and
site-specific (blue) activities of Pt—Ni
nanowires (7.3 ± 0.3 wt % Pt), annealed in hydrogen to 250 °C
and acid-leached to a variety of compositions, at 0.9 V vs RHE. The
solid red line and dashed blue line were included for the mass and
site-specific activity of Pt/HSC. (c) Amount of catalyst lost to the
electrolyte after acid exposure (Ni Acid) and potential cycling (Ni

ORR activities of Pt—Ni nanowires annealed in hydrogen before

included for the mass (red) and site-specific (blue) activities of
Pt/HSC after durability testing. Durability consisted of 30 000
cycles in the potential range of 0.6–1.0 V vs RHE in 0.1 M
perchloric acid. ORR activities were taken during anodic polarization
scans at 20 mV s–1 and 1600 rpm and were corrected
for internal resistance and mass transport.

2.3 Oxygen Anneal
Annealing in oxygen
was pursued since the approach had previously improved the durability
of as-synthesized Pt—Ni nanowires.45 All acid-treated catalysts were annealed in oxygen at 175 °C,
which was found to provide a balance between durability and initial
activity. Trends in the oxygen annealing step can be divided into
three groups. At one extreme, for catalysts with low Pt compositions,
annealing in oxygen dramatically reduced the Pt-ECA and ORR performance.
Although the intent was to reduce Ni dissolution and durability losses,
large amounts of Ni persisted at the nanowire surface. Oxygen annealing
stabilized Ni, which prevented Pt surface cleaning during electrochemical
conditioning and resulted in low activity. At the other extreme, for
catalysts with high Pt compositions, little Ni was present, and oxygen
annealing had minimal impact. Although these materials were highly
durable, they were of less interest electrocatalytically. Between
these two extremes, Pt—Ni nanowires (15.2 wt % Pt) were found
that produced high initial activity, a high degree of durability,
and low amounts of Ni dissolution (Figures 6, S18, and S19, and Table S5).

nanowires (7.3 ± 0.3 wt % Pt), annealed in hydrogen to 250 °C,

to 175 °C, at 0.9 V vs RHE. The solid red line and dashed blue

of 0.6–1.0 V vs RHE in 0.1 M perchloric acid. ORR activities
were taken during anodic polarization scans at 20 mV s–1 and 1600 rpm and were corrected for internal resistance and mass
transport. (e) Survey of examined catalysts, in terms of ECA (x axis) and site-specific activity (y axis),

250 °C and acid-leached (N1, acid); annealed in hydrogen to 250
°C, acid-leached (N1), and annealed in oxygen to 175 °C
(O2); and Pt/HSC before and after durability testing. Arrows

(4400 mA mgPt–1). (f) Table of the surveyed
catalysts, including the mass activities at 0.9 V before (im,i0.9 V) and after (im,f0.9 V) durability testing.

Oxygen annealing minimized activity
losses in durability testing
and decreased Ni dissolution, attributed to the increased prevalence
of Ni oxide (NiO) near the nanowire surface.45 High-resolution XPS of the optimized nanowires (15.2 wt % Pt, Ni
2p spectrum) showed a substantial decrease in the amount of Ni metal
(peak at 852.5 eV) near the nanowire surface, accompanied by the appearance
of NiO (peak at 854.2 eV, Figure 3). Without oxygen annealing (as-synthesized or hydrogen-annealed),
Ni hydroxide species, and not oxides, were observed. In RDE half-cells,
the optimized Pt—Ni nanowires (15.2 wt % Pt) exceeded the initial
ORR mass activity of the as-synthesized material by 3 times and Pt/HSC
by 11 times (Figure 6). After durability testing (30 000 cycles, 0.6–1.0
V vs RHE), the optimized catalyst also lost less than 3% of its initial
ORR mass activity and less than 0.5 wt % of its mass (Pt and Ni) due
to dissolution.

A summary of the Pt—Ni nanowire electrochemical
properties,
before and after durability, is provided in Figure 6e. This figure separates ECA (x axis) and specific activity (y axis) as the source
of mass activity. As-synthesized Pt—Ni nanowires (Pt—Ni)
produce higher specific activity than Pt/HSC due to the extended surface,
and hydrogen annealing (H2) further improves the specific
activity. Acid leaching (acid) slightly improved the durability but
at the cost of initial specific activity, and oxygen annealing (O2) provided the optimum in activity (ECA and specific activity)
and durability.

3 Conclusions
Pt—Ni
nanowires were previously demonstrated with surface
areas in excess of 90 m2 gPt–1, a significant breakthrough in and of itself for extended thin-film
electrocatalysts.36 These materials, however,
lacked exceptional site-specific activity and durability. Through
a series of postsynthesis optimization steps, Pt—Ni nanowires
were developed with dramatically improved specific activity, durability,
and stability (Ni dissolution). The optimized nanowires demonstrated
ORR activities 3 times greater than the as-synthesized nanowires and
11 times greater than Pt/HSC. After durability testing, the optimized
Pt—Ni nanowires lost less than 3% of their initial mass activity
and less than 0.3 wt % of Ni due to dissolution, a significant improvement
to the as-synthesized material (21% loss in activity, 7% Ni to dissolution).
The electrochemical properties of these catalysts are summarized in Figure 6. To date, no study
has produced extended surface, Pt electrocatalysts for ORR with the
high surface areas, specific activities, and durability reported here.
Although these materials offer significant performance advantages
when tested in RDE, a major challenge remains in incorporating them
effectively into high-performance electrodes and devices.

In
RDE half-cell tests, Pt—Ni nanowires offer greater than
a 10-fold improvement in performance and significant durability benefits
to Pt nanoparticles. These results suggest that much lower loadings
could potentially be used in PEMFC electrodes and that Pt—Ni
nanowires can become a critical element for enabling the broader commercial
deployment of fuel cells.

4 Experimental Section
Pt—Ni nanowires were synthesized by the spontaneous galvanic
displacement of Ni nanowires with Pt.36 Ni nanowires (40 mg, as-received PlasmaChem GmbH) were dispersed
by sonication in 80 mL of water in a 250 mL round bottom flask. The
flask contents were heated in an oil bath to 90 °C and stirred
at approximately 500 rpm by a Teflon paddle (glass shaft). After a
15 min wait period, the Pt precursor (8.1 mg of potassium tetrachloroplatinate
in 15 mL of water) was added dropwise by a syringe pump over a period
of 15 min. After the addition of the Pt precursor, the reaction continued
for 2 h at 90 °C, at which point it was cooled to room temperature.
Pt—Ni nanowires were washed in water and 2-propanol and collected
by centrifugation.

Postsynthesis annealing of the Pt—Ni
nanowires was completed
in a Lindberg/Blue M split-hinge tubular furnace, equipped with a
2 in. quartz tube. Samples were inserted into the tube and vacuumed
overnight to ensure adequate drying, using a Pfeiffer Vacuum Duo 2.5
and a Pfeiffer HiCUBE pumping station connected to a MKS Type 146
vacuum gauge measurement and control system. After vacuuming, a low
flow rate of gas (hydrogen or oxygen, depending on the experiment)
was fed to the tube. Annealing was completed on samples to a variety
of temperatures, with a 10 °C min–1 ramp rate
and a 2 h run time. After the annealing was complete, the furnace
cooled to room temperature naturally. The glass blowing of the quartz
tube and the fitting to account for vacuum and gas flow were completed
in-house.

Annealing of the Pt—Ni nanowires in hydrogen
(10%, balance
nitrogen) was completed with low gas flow, 500 Torr of back pressure,
a 10 °C min–1 ramp rate, and a 2 h run time.
Acid leaching of Pt—Ni nanowires occurred in acetic, nitric,
or sulfuric acid, with exposure to different concentrations, temperatures,
and times, to create materials with a variety of compositions. The
conditions and compositions produced are summarized in Table S4. All acid leaching experiments were
conducted in a nitrogen environment by way of a Schlenk line. Annealing
of the Pt—Ni nanowires in oxygen (50%, balance nitrogen) was
completed with low gas flow, 500 Torr of back pressure, a 10 °C
min–1 ramp rate, and a 2 h run time.

Material
compositions were determined by ICP-MS, taken on a Thermo
Scientific iCAP Q. Samples were digested in aqua regia and diluted
to total sample concentrations of 200, 20, and 2 ppb. The dilutions
were matrix matched to 1.5% hydrochloric acid and 0.5% nitric acid
and filtered to 0.4 μm. The instrument was calibrated to a blank,
an internal standard, and three Pt Ni standards. Measurements of each
dilution were taken three times at a dwell time of 0.15 s. After the
analysis of every five dilutions, the ICP-MS was checked to a Pt Ni
standard.

ICP-MS was also completed on electrolytes (0.1 M perchloric
acid)
after electrochemical conditioning and durability testing. Electrolytes
were filtered but not diluted for analysis as the Pt Ni concentrations
were on a ppb level, above the detection limit but well below a concentration
to flood the detector. Standards and the blank were matrix matched
to 0.1 M perchloric acid. ICP-MS accounted for Pt or Ni that dissolved
from the electrode but could not account for the material lost by
catalyst layer delamination, which would not have been uniformly dispersed
in the electrolyte.

XRD patterns were taken on a Bruker D8 Discover
at 40 kV and 35
mA over a period of 1 h. Samples were prepared dry on a double-sided
carbon tape and attached to a glass slide. An XRD pattern of the blank
carbon tape and the glass slide was subtracted from the presented
XRD data. The magnified XRD pattern at a 2θ of 38–45°
was normalized to the height of the Ni(111) peak and the background.
All hydrogen-annealed samples originated from the same as-synthesized
batch and contained the same amount of Pt (7.3 ± 0.3 wt % Pt).
Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns was completed using Match 3.2.2
(interface) and FullProf 2.05. Refinement was used to determine the
average Pt unit cell parameter and assumed a constant Ni lattice of
3.524 Å.

General wire morphology was evaluated by scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM) using a JEOL JSM-7000F field emission SEM and by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) using a Philips CM200 TEM operated at 200
kV. Higher-resolution TEM, scanning TEM (STEM), and X-ray energy dispersive
spectroscopy analyses were obtained using an FEI Talos S/TEM operated
at 300 kV and equipped with a ChemiSTEM detector.

XANES and
EXAFS spectra were completed at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource, beamline 4-1 at the Pt L3 edge using
a Ge array fluorescence detector. Samples were mounted on a kapton
tape, and a Pt foil reference was collected in the transmittance mode
simultaneously with all samples. Three scans were averaged for each
sample. XPS was completed on a Kratos Axis Nova X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source operated at 300
W. CasaXPS software was used for data analysis with all spectra aligned
to Pt at 71.1 eV, using Shirley background for Pt 4f and Ni 2p spectra
and linear background for O 1s and C 1s spectra.

Plane-wave
DFT calculations were performed in the Vienna ab-initio
simulation package (VASP).46−49 Projector-augmented waves basis sets with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional were implemented as they are known to reproduce the physico-chemical
properties well.50−52 Stringent convergence criteria of 10–6 eV (10–5) on electronic (geometric) relaxations
were placed on calculations with a large kinetic energy cut-off of
520 eV applied to the basis set. Pt—Ni alloys, Ni3Pt and Pt3Ni, were first relaxed in the bulk under a Monkhorst–Pack
grid of 13 × 13 × 13 centered at Γ and then appropriately
sliced to expose the (100), (110), and (111) facets. These surfaces
were evaluated alone and with a Pt skin of 1 and 3 layers. A vacuum
gap >12 Å was added to avoid spurious interaction between
periodic
images. Surface calculations occurred under a k-point
sampling of 4 × 4 × 1 for (100) and (111) and 2 × 3
× 1 for (110). Because of the size of the supercell, the (111)
surface composed of a Pt skin of three layers on an alloy utilized
a grid of 2 × 2 × 1. Reference atomic energies were calculated
at the Γ point in a box of volume >1000 Å3 with
the symmetry of the cell broken to replicate appropriate spin states.
Cohesive energies (Ecoh) were determined
with the equation 1  where Etot,surf is the total energy in VASP of the surface, ENi (EPt) are reference
atomic energies,
and nNi (nPt) are the number, n, of Ni (Pt). Reported cohesive
energies follow the convention of negative energies indicating attraction
between atoms for stabilization.

DFT calculations were performed
to understand relative stabilities
of a Pt skin on Pt—Ni alloys, both on Ni3Pt and
Pt3Ni, and on the relevant facets of (100), (110), and
(111) of these alloys (Figures 4, S8, and S9, and Tables S1–S3). Appropriate lattice constants were chosen to consider conditions
such as the alloy’s compressed lattice, a lattice midway between
the alloy and Pt, and the lattice of pure Pt. For a Pt skin on Ni3Pt, lattice constants of 3.62, 3.77, and 3.92 Å were
explored, and for Pt3Ni, 3.82, 3.87, and 3.92 Å were
explored. These lattice constants represent a sampling of the range
of surface phenomena that would be present on the nanowires. Moreover,
the stability of the Pt skin on these alloys was further explored
by modeling a Pt skin composed of a single layer and of three layers
on Pt—Ni alloys. This provides a first-order approximation
of the stability of Pt-skin growth on the faceted alloy. On the (100)
and (110) surfaces of Ni3Pt, the alloy alternates between
a layer of Ni and a layer of Pt and Ni atoms. The Pt skin was evaluated
on both to consider the Ni-enrichment, sublayer effect on Pt—Ni.53 More details are provided in Supporting Information regarding the construction of these
surfaces.

Electrochemical testing was completed in RDE half-cells
in 0.1
M perchloric acid. The RDE half-cell contained a glassy carbon working
electrode, a platinum mesh counter electrode, and a RHE reference
electrode.54 The RHE reference consisted
of a glass bubbler containing hydrogen-saturated 0.1 M perchloric
acid, connected to the main cell by a Luggin capillary. Electrochemical
measurements were taken with an Autolab potentiostat (Eco Chemie,
Metrohm Autolab B.V.), and rotation of the working electrode was controlled
by a modulated speed controller (Pine Instrument Company).

Pt—Ni
nanowire inks were prepared by adding 7.6 mL of water
and 2.4 mL of 2-propanol to 1 mg of the catalyst. The ink was iced
for 5 min, then 10 μL of Nafion (5 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich) was
added, and the ink was horn sonicated for 30 s, bath sonicated for
20 min, and horn sonicated for 30 s.55 The
sonicated ink (7.5 mL) was then added to 0.5 mg of graphitized carbon
nanofibers, and the sonication process (30 s horn, 20 min bath, 30
s horn) was repeated. Ink (10 μL) was pipetted onto an RDE working
electrode, inverted on a test stand. After ink application, the electrode
rotation speed was increased to 700 rpm, and the ink was sonicated
(20 min bath, 30 s horn) while the working electrodes dried.56 Reapplication of the nanowire inks, necessary
to increase the ORR diffusion-limited current, continued until 50
μL of ink had been pipetted and dried onto the electrode.

The as-synthesized Pt—Ni nanowires were evaluated in a previous
publication and served as the starting point for the materials developed
here. The activity of as-synthesized Pt—Ni nanowires was previously
reported as 917 mA mgPt–1, compared with
1653 mA mgPt–1 reported here.36 The improvement in activity was
due to optimized electrode-coating methods, that is, using a rotational
electrode-coating method and making changes to the ink, including
a reduction in the catalyst concentration and Nafion/carbon content
optimization. The rotational coating method also improved the Pt/HSC
performance from 300 to 500 mA mgPt–1.56

Pt/HSC (46 wt % Pt, Tanaka Kikinzoku
Kogyo) was used as a benchmark
catalyst in this study. Pt/HSC inks contained 7.6 mg of catalyst,
7.6 mL of water, 2.4 mL of 2-propanol, and 40 μL of Nafion.
After sonication (20 min bath), 10 μL of ink was dispensed onto
the working electrodes and dried in air at 700 rpm.

ECAs were
determined by carbon monoxide oxidation voltammograms
and verified by charges due to hydrogen underpotential deposition.
In the oxidation of an adsorbed carbon monoxide layer, the working
electrodes were held at 0.1 V versus RHE for 20 min in 0.1 M perchloric
acid. For the first 10 min, carbon monoxide was bubbled into the electrolyte
to adsorb a layer onto the catalyst. For the second 10 min, nitrogen
was bubbled into the electrolyte to remove excess carbon monoxide.
Because of the location of the bubbler, rotation of the working electrode
at 2500 rpm was required. Electrode rotation and gas bubbling were
turned off 30 s before the end of the 20 min hold. A linear sweep
was immediately run at 20 mV s–1 anodically to 1.2
V versus RHE, then cathodically to 0.025 V versus RHE. Cyclic voltammograms
(0.025–1.2 V vs RHE) were run thereafter to ensure that excess
carbon monoxide had been removed from the RDE half-cell before the
end of the potential hold. ECAs were calculated from the carbon monoxide
oxidation voltammograms assuming a Coulombic charge of 420 μC
cmPt–2. ECAs were verified by the charge
associated with hydrogen adsorption, assuming a Coulombic charge of
210 μC cmPt–2.

Germanium
and tellurium adsorption was used to quantify the amount
of Pt{100} and {111} facets present on the catalyst surfaces.40,57 All electrodes underwent electrochemical conditioning (potential
cycling up to 1.2 V) before metal adsorption. To adsorb germanium,
a drop of 1 M sodium hydroxide containing 0.01 M germanium(IV) oxide
(483 001, 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the electrode
surface. With the drop coating the working electrode, it was submerged
into 0.5 M sulfuric acid at 0.1 V versus RHE and immediately scanned
at 50 mV s–1 in the potential range of 0.025–0.6
V versus RHE. The charge due to germanium redox was normalized to
the ECA from Pt{100} by the conversion 0.56.40 To adsorb tellurium, the electrode tips were submerged for 10 min
in 0.5 M sulfuric acid containing 10–4 M tellurium
dioxide (435 902, 99.9995%, Sigma-Aldrich) and then rinsed
with water. After tellurium adsorption, the working electrodes were
scanned at 50 mV s–1 in 0.5 M sulfuric acid in the
potential range of 0.025–0.9 V versus RHE.57

ORR polarization curves were taken anodically at
20 mV s–1 in the potential range of −0.01–1.05
V versus RHE
at 1600 rpm in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M perchloric acid electrolyte.
The diffusion-limited currents for ORR (4.7–4.9 mA cmelec–2) were lower than those typically found at the
sea level, due to the elevation where the experiments were completed
(83.2 kPa at 5674 ft of elevation). These diffusion-limited currents,
however, were typical for the elevation and were predicted by the
Levich equation, in which the diffusion-limited current is linearly
proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen. The diffusion-limited
currents were not corrected in the linear polarization curves. ORR
activities, however, were corrected for mass transport (by the Koutecky–Levich
equation), the internal resistance of the electrolyte (18–25
Ω, depending on the electrode), and the partial pressure of
oxygen (a reaction order of 0.75 at 0.9 V vs RHE).58−60 As a reference
point, polycrystalline Pt produced ORR site-specific activities of
2500 and 445 μA cmPt–2, respectively,
at 0.9 and 0.95 V versus RHE.

The ORR activities reported here
have been corrected for mass transport.
With the high performances reported here, it was possible that the
kinetic ORR activities were overcorrected by the Koutecky–Levich
equation. To ensure that the ORR activities were not overestimated,
activities at 0.95 V were included in the Supporting Information section
(Figures S2, S11, and S14). Activities
at 0.9 V, however, were used in the main text because the DOE-MEA
target is at that potential and because the activity benefit of Pt—Ni
nanowires (compared to Pt/HSC) was similar at 0.9 and 0.95 V.

Durability testing was completed by potential cycling (30 000
cycles) in the range of 0.6–1.0 V versus RHE in a nitrogen-saturated
0.1 M perchloric acid electrolyte. Full cyclic voltammograms were
taken every 1000 cycles until 5000 and every 5000 cycles thereafter
to monitor catalyst ECA by hydrogen underpotential deposition. ORR
polarization curves and carbon monoxide oxidation voltammograms were
taken after durability testing.
