Acute myocardial infarction (AMI),
also recognized as a “heart
attack,” is one leading cause of death globally, and cardiac
myoglobin (cMb), an important cardiac biomarker, is used for the early
assessment of AMI. This paper presents an ultrasensitive, label-free
electrochemical aptamer-based sensor (aptasensor) for cMb detection
using polyethylenimine (PEI)-functionalized reduced graphene oxide
(PEI–rGO) thin films. PEI, a cationic polymer, was used as
a reducing agent for graphene oxide (GO), providing highly positive
charges on the rGO surface and allowing direct immobilization of negatively
charged single-strand DNA aptamers against cMb via electrostatic interaction
without any linker or coupling chemistry. The presence of cMb was
detected on Mb aptamer-modified electrodes using differential pulse
voltammetry via measuring the current change due to the direct electron
transfer between the electrodes and cMb proteins (Fe3+/Fe2+). The limits of detection were 0.97 pg mL–1 (phosphate-buffered saline) and 2.1 pg mL–1 (10-fold-diluted
human serum), with a linear behavior with logarithmic cMb concentration.
The specificity and reproducibility of the aptasensors were also examined.
This electrochemical aptasensor using polymer-modified rGO shows potential
for the early assessment of cMb in point-of-care testing applications.

1 Introduction
Acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the fatal diseases
for humans. Although electrocardiography is extensively used for early
detection of AMI, only 57% of AMI patients are accurately diagnosed,
with some showing normal ECG or nondiagnostic results when diagnosed
by an emergency department.1,2 Therefore, the measurement
of cardiac biomarkers in a blood sample is a useful and essential
diagnostic tool for AMI, and the biomarkers include cardiac myoglobin
(cMb) and cardiac troponins I and T. Cardiac troponins are considered
the most specific biomarkers for AMI diagnosis but not used as early
detection biomarkers for AMI.3 In contrast,
cMb is a biomarker for early detection of AMI because of its quick
release into the blood from damaged cardiac muscles than any others
after the onset of AMI.4 cMb concentration
in the blood increases rapidly within 1–3 h and reaches the
peak within 6–12 h.4 In human serum,
cMb concentration is considered normal in a range of 30–90
ng mL–1 and increases up to approximately 200 ng
mL–1 within 6–12 h after AMI.5

To date, several methods have been used for cMb detection
such
as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay;5 mass
spectrometry;6 liquid chromatography;7 surface plasmon resonance;8,9 colorimetric,10 fluorescence,11 and
polyaniline nanowire biosensors;12 molecularly
imprinted polymer (MIP) sensors;13 and
MIP-based electrochemical sensors.14,15 Among the
reported methods, the MIP technique provides synthetic recognition
materials for biomarkers, which can increase the robustness of the
device.15 However, despite their advances,
MIP-based sensors have several chemical problems in cross-linking,
which leads to the polymer layers with different binding sites and
differences between the batches of preparation.16 In comparison with antibodies and MIPs, aptamers are short
nucleic acids with loop-like secondary structures, enabling their
binding with target molecules with good affinity and specificity.17 Furthermore, aptamers possess several advantages
such as low cost, high reproducibility, and thermal stability, and
it can be modified easily with several functional groups.18 Moreover, the electrochemical technique is especially
favorable for cMb detection as myoglobin (Fe3+/Fe2+) is redox-active, which allows the direct electron transfer between
the electrode and the protein,19 possessing
advantages such as high sensitivity, simple instrumentation, rapid
analysis, and low cost.18,20

Until date, graphene
or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been explored
to improve the performance of electrochemical biosensors,21 owing to its most attractive mechanical and
electrical properties.22,23 Numerous chemicals such as hydrazine,24 dimethylhydrazine,25 and NaBH426 are used for reduction
of graphene oxide (GO) to rGO, and they are mostly toxic or explosive.
Irreversible aggregates of rGO sheets also form during the reduction
process through van der Waals forces, making it difficult to have
dispersity and stability in water. Hence, various polymers such as
polyaniline,27 polypyrrole,28 polyallylamine,29 poly(vinyl alcohol),30 and poly(diallyl
dimethylammonium chloride)31 have been
used for the modification to improve their electrical and optical
properties in electrochemical biosensing. Moreover, rGO functionalized
with hydrophilic polymers can prevent aggregation in aqueous media
and reduce GO to rGO simultaneously.

Polyethylenimine (PEI)
is a hydrophilic, cationic polymer with
a high density of amine (+NH2) groups, which provides positive
charges on the surface. Because of its active amine groups, PEI can
easily attach to certain active groups of GO (e.g., carboxyl or epoxy
groups) covalently and simultaneously reduce GO to PEI–rGO,
minimizing the synthesis steps and increasing the conductivity. Moreover,
PEI can act as an electron promoter between the electrode and electrolyte
solution, leading to a more sensitive response; hence, it can be a
perfect candidate for the surface modification of GO and electrochemical
sensors.32,33 However, only a few reports on PEI-graphene-based
electrochemical biosensors have been presented for detection of the
following analytes: H2O2,34,35 dopamine,36,37Escherichia coli,38 glucose,39 gallic acid,40 metal ions,41 and gas molecules.42 Furthermore, the applications and schemes of PEI–rGO in these
studies are completely or quite different from those of the present
study. For example, previously PEI-functionalized GO was used as a
vector for gene delivery,33 used for immobilizing
a model enzyme, CYP2D6,43 or used for detecting
cardiac troponins using the electrophoretic deposition method.44

In this study, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive
and label-free
electrochemical aptamer-based sensor (aptasensor) for cMb detection
using PEI-grafted rGO thin films. A simple chemical route was used
for the synthesis of the PEI–rGO matrix with improved electronic
properties for electrochemical biosensors at room temperature. In
brief, GO was synthesized using the modified Hummer’s method,45 and PEI was grafted onto the GO surface, allowing
positive charges onto the GO surface and reducing it to rGO. The synthesized
PEI–rGO was deposited as a thin and uniform film with a wide
range of thicknesses (from nm to μm) using the drop-casting
method,46 which has various advantages
over other deposition techniques such as simple, cost-effective, fast,
and room-temperature method. The film thickness can be controlled
by tuning a few parameters such as volume, concentration of the solution,
and so forth. The PEI–rGO thin film provided large, positively
charged surfaces, which is critical in adsorbing the negatively charged
cMb aptamers without any linker or coupling chemistry.47 Moreover, PEI–rGO could accelerate electron
transfer, enabling signal amplification without the use of enzymes
or nanoparticles. This proposed electrochemical aptasensor shows numerous
advantages over conventional approaches such as enhanced limit of
detection (LOD), wide linear ranges, sensitivity, reusability, and
reproducibility.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of PEI–rGO-Coated
ITO/Glass Electrodes
Figure 1 represents the functionalization process of the PEI–rGO
aptasensor. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images
of a bare ITO/glass (Figure 2A) and PEI–rGO thin film-coated ITO/glass electrode
(Figure 2B) showed
a uniform and thin film covering a large surface area on the electrode. Figure 2C shows the cross
section of the layered thin film of PEI–rGO, demonstrating
that a highly ordered thin film can be deposited by drop-casting via
controlling the concentration and volume of the solution. Moreover,
the coffee-ring effect was negligible in this study because of strong
interactions between the PEI-rGO sheets and the hydrolyzed ITO substrates.46 An FE-SEM image of an Mb aptamer-modified PEI–rGO
surface showed many tiny and bright clusters on the surfaces, implying
the immobilization of Mb aptamers (Figure 2D). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
of the GO sheets (Figure 2E) and PEI–rGO sheets (Figure 2F) showed homogenous dispersion on the surface.
The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images
of GO and PEI–rGO showed the opaque and sheet-like structure
on a carbon copper grid (Figure S2A) and
transparent and thin layers of rGO after reduction by PEI (Figure S2B), respectively.

mL–1) immobilized onto the PEI–rGO film.

The UV–vis spectra (Figure S3) and the Raman spectra (Figure S4) of
both the GO and PEI–rGO matrix showed successful reduction
of GO upon functionalization with PEI or the formation of PEI–rGO.
The polymer reduction was also characterized by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, which is considered a useful tool to
identify the removal and evolution of functional groups.48,49 The XPS spectra of GO and PEI–rGO thin films showed both
peaks of C 1s and O 1s at 284.6 and 530 eV, respectively (Figure 3A). In the XPS spectra
of GO, the oxygen peak intensity was stronger than that of the carbon.
However, in the XPS spectra of the PEI–rGO thin film, the carbon
peak was stronger than the oxygen peak owing to the reduction, which
evidently shows that oxygen-containing groups for PEI–rGO were
significantly eliminated. The additional new peak N 1s at 398 eV was
observed, indicating a high density of −NH2 groups
of PEI chains introduced onto the GO surface and hence reduction to
PEI–rGO. The C 1s XPS spectra of GO and PEI-rGO are shown in Figure S5A,B.

and PEI–rGO thin film
for analyses of surface modification and reduction of GO by PEI with
various spectroscopic techniques: (A) XPS and (B) FTIR spectra of
GO and PEI–rGO thin films.

The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy–attenuated total
reflectance (FTIR–ATR) spectra of GO showed stretching vibrations
for functional groups such as O–H (3400 cm–1), C=O (1735 cm–1), C=C (1633 cm–1), C–O (1050 cm–1), and C–O–C
(1217 cm–1) (Figure 3B).50,51 In addition, the bending vibration
peak of the O–H group was measured at 1423 cm–1. For the PEI–rGO spectra, the stretching vibration of −NH2/NH groups was found at 3400 cm–1 and an
absorption doublet peak at 2851 and 2924 cm–1 was
observed, which was attributed to the −CH2 symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching vibration of the PEI chain.52 After reduction, the stretching frequency (1735
cm–1) to C=O was shifted to 1630 cm–1 owing to the CO–NH bond formation.53 The new peaks appeared at 1455 cm–1 for bending
vibration of the N–H group and at 1363 and 1108 cm–1 because of the C–N stretching vibration. These FTIR results
indicate the successful incorporation of PEI into −COOH-modified
GO.52

2.2 Electrochemical
Studies of Modified ITO/Glass
Electrodes
Figure 4A shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the electrodes
with different functionalizations (ITO/glass, GO/ITO/glass, PEI/ITO/glass,
PEI–rGO/ITO/glass, Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass, and BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass).
The peak current for a GO/ITO/glass electrode (149 μA) was less
than that of a bare ITO/glass electrode (207 μA), which might
be due to a reduction in electron transfer caused by a GO layer. The
peak current for PEI–rGO/ITO/glass increased up to 287 μA
after modification with PEI–rGO in comparison with those of
PEI/ITO/glass (254 μA) and GO/ITO/glass (149 μA) owing
to the high electron transfer property of PEI–rGO. The insulating
behavior and entrapment of redox active sites by aptamers blocked
the electron transfer and hence decreased the peak current to 52.3
μA after immobilization of Mb aptamers. We observed that the
peak current was further decreased to 41.2 μA after bovine serum
albumin (BSA) binding because of the insulating behavior of the BSA
protein. The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements (Figure 4B) agreed well with
the CV ones.

Figure 4 (A) Cyclic voltammograms and (B) differential pulse voltammograms
of ITO/glass, GO/ITO/glass, PEI/ITO/glass, PEI–rGO/ITO/glass,
Mb-apta/PEI-rGO/ITO/glass, and BSA/Mb-apta/PEI-rGO/ITO/glass-modified
electrodes. (C) EIS spectra of ITO/glass, GO/ITO/glass, PEI–rGO/ITO/glass,
Mb-apta/PEI-rGO/ITO/glass, and BSA/Mb-apta/PEI-rGO/ITO/glass-modified
electrodes in PBS buffer with 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] and 0.5 M KCl.

The interfacial changes induced during the immobilization
were
also recorded by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure 4C) at an electric
potential of 0.1 V and an amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range
(0.1 Hz to 100 kHz). The charge transfer resistance (RCT), solution resistance (RS), and double-layer capacitance (Cdl)
were computed during the different stages of our electrochemical aptasensor
development (Table S1). The RCT (1.9 kΩ) for the ITO/glass electrode increased
up to 3.7 kΩ after GO deposition and was decreased (710
Ω) after deposition of PEI–rGO/ITO/glass. This was due
to the cross-linking of sheets with one another in the existence of
PEI, which increased the electron transfer rate.54 The RCT value increased to
6.8 kΩ after aptamer immobilization, which indicates
the binding of aptamers on the PEI–rGO-modified electrode surface
owing to the interaction between PEI (positive charges) and aptamers
(negative charges). A further increase in the RCT value (9.31 kΩ) for a BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass
electrode was measured after BSA deposition, which covered the nonspecific
sites of the Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO electrode and blocked the
electron transfer. Scan rate studies were conducted for the BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass
electrode with varying scan rates (10–120 mV/s) (Figure S6).

2.3 Optimization
of Aptamer Concentration and
Response Time
DPV was used to determine the optimal concentration
of the aptamer bound to the PEI–rGO/ITO/glass electrode. The
electrode current decreased with the increasing Mb aptamer (Mb-apta)
concentrations (2–20 μg mL–1) and was
saturated at a concentration of 12 μg mL–1 (Figure S7A). The peak current of the
BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass electrode was also measured at
a cMb concentration of 100 ng mL–1 as the incubation
time was varied from 5 to 60 min. A rapid increase in the peak current
with an increase in incubation time was observed, and the current
was saturated around 30 min, resulting in the maximum binding of the
cMb antigens to the electrode surface (Figure S7B).

2.4 Electrochemical Detection
of cMb
DPV was conducted to determine the electrochemical
response of the
BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass electrode for various cMb concentrations
(0.001–1000 ng mL–1) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.4, 1×) (Figure 5A). The peak current increased with increasing cMb
concentration.5,18,55 The reduction peak occurred at a potential of −0.5 V for
all cMb concentrations owing to the reduction of the Fe moiety present
in cMb. Moreover, reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ can
occur at an electrode surface by the transfer of one electron.19 The peak current exhibited a linear relationship
(R2 = 0.98) with the logarithm of cMb
concentration (0.001–1000 ng mL–1) in PBS
(Figure 5B). The sensitivity
of the electrode and LOD based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was
calculated to be 3.77 μA mL ng–1 and 0.97
pg mL–1, respectively. The PEI–rGO thin film
provided a large surface area and appropriate configuration to the
aptamer, thus stimulating the efficient aptamer–antigen binding
and hence the sensitivity of the aptasensor.

voltammograms recorded in PBS for detection
of cMb concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1000 ng mL–1. (B) Calibration curve for the detection of cMb concentration (0.001–1000
ng mL–1) diluted in PBS and human serum (10-fold-diluted
serum). The error bars represent the standard deviations of three
independent measurements.

The electrochemical aptasensor was also tested for cMb concentrations
(0.001–1000 ng mL–1) in 10-fold-diluted human
serum in PBS. A small volume (10 μL) of cMb concentrations spiked
in 10-fold-diluted human serum was immobilized on the electrode (BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass).
The peak current increased with increasing cMb concentration (Figure 5B). The aptasensor
showed a linear behavior (R2 = 0.98),
and the LOD was 2.1 pg mL–1. Thus, this aptasensor
can be practically used for the quantitative analysis and early detection
of cMb in real samples. Moreover, high electrical conductance of PEI–rGO
thin films and selective binding of the aptamers enhanced the LOD
and sensitivity of the aptasensor, which is comparable to other electrochemical
sensors (Table 1).

2.5 Reproducibility and Stability of Aptasensors
The repeatability of the aptasensor was performed with cMb concentration
(100 ng mL–1) for five samples modified on the electrode
(BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO/glass). The response showed an acceptable
relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.8% (Table S2 & Figure 6A). To determine the stability of the aptasensors, samples (100 ng
mL–1) were measured on the same day and stored at
two different places (4 °C and room temperature) for 15 days,
and the aptasensor gained 92% after storage at 4 °C and 83% at
room temperature of the initial respective current responses after
12 days (Figure 6B).

Figure 6 (A) Reproducibility
of the aptasensors was evaluated using 100
ng mL–1 cMb concentration in five different devices.
The inset represents the bar graph of five sensors. (B) Stability
of the aptasensors at 4 °C and room temperature (25 °C).
The current responses of the electrodes were observed at three day
intervals for 15 days. (C) Selectivity of the aptasensors was evaluated
against BSA, cTnI, and cTnT (100 ng mL–1). The error
bars represent the standard deviations of three independent measurements.

2.6 Specificity Test
To assess the specificity
of the aptasensors, cardiac-specific troponins (cTnT & cTnI) and
BSA protein with concentrations of 100 ng mL–1 were
chosen, which coincides with the biological cMb level in serum samples
(Figure 6C).56−58 The aptasensors showed negligible changes in current responses after
the immobilization of cTnT, cTnI, and BSA. However, when 100 ng mL–1 cMb was added to the aptasensors, the current showed
a rapid and sharp increase. This test shows that this aptasensor possesses
high selectivity to cMb.

3 Conclusions
We have
presented an ultrasensitive and label-free electrochemical
aptasensor using PEI rGO (PEI–rGO) to detect cMb. A cost-effective
and straightforward chemical process was adopted to synthesize PEI–rGO
at room temperature. Here, PEI was used as both a surface modifier
and a reducing agent in reduction of GO to PEI–rGO. The electrical
conductivity of PEI–rGO thin films increased in comparison
with GO, showing the direct reduction of GO by PEI. PEI provided a
large number of amine groups, allowing covalent bonding on the −COOH-modified
GO surface via the amide bond. Moreover, positively charged PEI–rGO
surfaces allowed direct immobilization of negatively charged DNA aptamers
via electrostatic interaction without any linker or coupling chemistry,
reducing the functionalization step of the sensor. PEI–rGO
thin films showed high electrical property and provided a large surface
area, resulting in label-free and highly sensitive detection of cMb.
It also exhibited excellent dispersibility and stability in water,
allowing synthesis of homogenous and thin films. The fabricated BSA/Mb-apta/PEI–rGO/ITO
electrode showed good sensitivity (3.7 μA mL ng–1) with a log-linear detection range (0.001–1000 ng mL–1) and notable LOD (0.97 pg mL–1).
The measurement of these aptasensors was ∼94% at 4 °C
storage and ∼92% at room temperature storage after 15 days.
Compared to other biosensors based on antigen–antibody binding
and MIP, this electrochemical aptasensor demonstrated excellent performance
in terms of reproducibility, stability, response time, and high selectivity
against other cardiac proteins.

4.3 Synthesis of GO and PEI–rGO
GO was synthesized using the modified Hummer’s method,45,59 and its detailed process was previously reported.60 The GO suspension was treated with EDC (10 mM) with 60
min of sonication and with PEI solution (500 μg mL–1). The resulting solution was kept reacting overnight at room temperature.
PEI was covalently attached via binding of −NH2 groups
of PEI with −COOH-modified GO using EDC chemistry. The color
of GO solution (dark brown) changed from dark brown to black, implying
the reduction of GO. The resulting solution (PEI–rGO) was washed
with deionized (DI) water three times and centrifuged at 5000 rpm
(83 s–1) to remove unbounded PEI and organic impurities.
An aqueous solution of the PEI–rGO matrix was prepared by sonicating
for 30 min to remove any aggregates, centrifuging the solution at
5000 rpm (83 s–1) for 30 min, and then collecting
the supernatant. The PEI–rGO aqueous suspension was very stable,
and no distinct precipitate was observed even after several weeks
of storage. Figure S1 shows the mechanism
of −COOH-modified GO and synthesis of the PEI–rGO matrix.

4.4 Fabrication of the ITO/Glass Electrode
A piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2 = 3:1) was used to clean the glass wafer (6 in.) for 10 min,
and the wafer was rinsed with DI water and dried with nitrogen (N2) gas. Indium tin oxide (ITO) (thickness: 100 nm) was deposited
by RF-sputtering on the glass wafer and annealed at 400 °C for
1 h. The ITO-coated glass wafer was diced into strips (2 cm ×
0.5 cm) acting as working electrodes; cleaned with acetone, methanol,
and DI water; and dried with N2 gas. The electrode was
incubated in a solution composed of H2O, NH4OH, and H2O2 [5:1:1 (v/v)] at 60 °C for
30 min in an oven for hydrolysis, and the solution was quickly quenched
with DI water for 2 min. Subsequently, the electrodes were washed
with DI water several times and dried with N2 gas.

4.5 Biofunctionalization of the PEI–rGO-Modified
ITO/Glass Electrode
As prepared, PEI–rGO aqueous suspension
(10 μL) was drop-cast onto the cleaned ITO/glass electrodes,
which were then dried at 60 °C in an oven for 1 h. A homogeneous
and thin film of PEI–rGO was formed on the ITO/glass electrodes,
rinsed with DI water, and dried with N2 gas. Afterward,
the PEI–rGO thin film-coated ITO/glass electrode was incubated
with DNA Mb aptamers (concentration: 12 μg mL–1) in DEPC-treated water at 37 °C for 2 h, thoroughly rinsed
with PBS to remove loosely attached aptamers, and air-dried at room
temperature for 5 min. The negatively charged Mb aptamers were attached
to positively charged PEI–rGO surfaces. The PEI–rGO-coated
ITO/glass electrodes were then incubated with BSA (1mg mL–1) at room temperature for 30 min to preclude possible nonspecific
binding and rinsed with PBS. The electrochemical measurements were
performed for Mb (0.001–1000 ng mL–1) in
PBS and human serum (10-fold-diluted) in PBS.
