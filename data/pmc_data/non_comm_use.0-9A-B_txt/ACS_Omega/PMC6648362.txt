TiO2/PO43– solid superacid
was synthesized by using the precipitation immersion method and characterized
by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and an energy-dispersive spectrometer;
it was added into flexible poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) composites as
a flame retardant. The smoke suppression and flame retardance of TiO2/PO43– accompanied by Sb2O3 were investigated through the limiting oxygen
index (LOI), cone calorimetry test, and thermogravimetry analysis
(TGA). The results indicated that the LOI value of PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) reached to 32.3%, which is higher by 6% than that of neat PVC (26.3%).
In addition, Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) greatly reduced the peak heat release rate
and total heat release simultaneously in comparison to using Sb2O3 separately, suggesting a significant synergistic
effect between TiO2/PO43– and
Sb2O3 on improving the flame retardancy of the
PVC. Further, results of TGA and differential thermal analysis showed
that the thermal stability of the composites was greatly improved.
For the Fourier transform infrared analysis, Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) leads to a
large amount of functional group surplus, which specifically indicates
that its carbon residue increases. The surface of the char formed
after combusting of the PVC compounds was observed through scanning
electron microscopy. It is found that the solid superacid can promote
decomposition, pyrolysis, and cross-linking of PVC into the compact
and continuous char layer on the surface of the material, which improved
the flame retardancy and smoke suppression of PVC.

1 Introduction
As is well known, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is one of the most
widely used engineering plastics.1 It has
broad applications in many areas such as wire materials, blood bags,
flooring, cables, audio records, wallpapers, window flames, packaging,
credit cards, medical tubing, pipes, bottles, and children’s
toys.2 However, pristine PVC has excellent
flame retardancy intrinsically with a limiting oxygen index (LOI)
of 47%. Therefore, additions of flame-retardant or smoke-suppressant
additives in PVC are not required.3 However,
the conventional plasticizers used in the manufacture of flexible
PVC detract from this outstanding fire resistance.4 When the flexible PVC composites contain 40 parts of dioctyl
phthalate (DOP), and plasticized PVC is combustible and releases smoke
and poisonous gas while burning, LOI decreases to 26% and the material
becomes a highly flammable material. Therefore, flame retardants are
usually needed for the flexible PVC in order to reduce the fire hazard.5

On the basis of a large number of studies,
the effective flame
retardants and smoke suppressants of PVC are classified into organic
and inorganic compounds, including antimony trioxide (Sb2O3), hydroxides, transition-metal oxides, and chlorinated
paraffins.6−8 In these flame retardants, Sb2O3 has a good flame retardant effect and is often used in PVC.4 However, antimony is a toxic element that is
harmful for human health. Moreover, under combustion conditions antimony
compounds produce toxic or irritating vapors. As is well known, a
combination of two or more components can sometimes present a synergistic
effect and may impart an excellent flame retardancy to polymers.9 Therefore, it is important to study the substitute
and the synergistic effects of Sb2O3 in order
to substitute a part or all of it.

Flame retardants generally
have the ability to isolate burners
or inhibit accelerants, which is achieved by promoting the decomposition
of polymer materials into dense carbon layers. In recent years, there
are a variety of solid superacids, such as sulfated zirconia (SO42–/ZrO2), sulfated tin oxide
(SO42–/SnO2), sulfated titanium
oxide (SO42–/TiO2), and so
on, which were the representative catalysts that showed good catalytic
activities for esterification reaction.10−12 It is well known that
solid superacids are generally used as catalysts for esterification
reaction because of promoting dehydration and cross-linking. For example,
Yan Li et al. studied that SO42–/ZrO2–TiO2/La3+ was applied in the
synthesis of fatty acid methyl ester and its detailed data of esterification.13 Ropero-Vega et al. investigated and found that
TiO2/SO42– was used in the
esterification of free fatty acids with ethanol.14 Bai verified that a series of SO42–/TiO2·x %SnO2 catalysts
were prepared using a sol–gel method and applied to catalyze
the esterification reaction of 1,6-hexanediol with crylic acid.15 In addition, the research studies showed that
the pyrolysis of polymers included many dehydration, esterification,
and cross-linking reactions.16 Hence, in
theory solid superacids can catalyze the pyrolysis of the polymer
and probably act as a flame retardant.

Until now, there is no
relevant report on the addition of a solid
superacid to flexible PVC as a flame retardant. In addition, phosphorus
is used in the preparation of a solid superacid because of the good
effect of phosphorus-based flame retardants. Consequently, in this
article, an attempt to replace a part of the harmful Sb2O3 in a flame-retardant flexible PVC composite by using
a TiO2/PO43– solid superacid
is studied. The synergistic effect between the TiO2/PO43– solid superacid and Sb2O3 on the flame retardancy of flexible PVC composites is discussed.
Thermal stability, flame retardancy, and carbonification of flexible
PVC composites were investigated. Furthermore, the mechanism of the
synergistic effect of the TiO2/PO43– solid superacid and the Sb2O3 flame-retarding
flexible PVC is proposed.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Material
Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4, 99%
AR) was purchased from Shanghai McLean technology Co.
Ltd. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4, AR) was bought
from Tianjin Yongda Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. PVC was supplied by
Beijing Chemical Second Factory. Lead sulfate tribasic, dibasic lead
phosphite, calcium stearate, and antimonous oxide (Sb2O3) were obtained from Beijing Yili Fine Chemicals Co. Ltd.
DOP was purchased form Shanghai Dongfang Chemical Factory.

2.2 Synthesis of the Solid Superacid
For the preparation
of the solid superacid, 30 mL of TiCl4 was slowly added
to distilled water in a three-neck flask with stirring
under room temperature. The precursor was prepared by adding the ammonia
water into the above mixture with vigorous stirring until the pH was
8–10 and then aged for 24 h. The obtained precipitate was washed
several times with deionized water and filtrated by a pump until the
Cl could not be identified in the filtrate. The cake after filtration
was dried at 50 °C for 12 h, and was impregnated with phosphoric
acid solution of 1.3 mol/L for 6 h, and then dried by air. The obtained
precipitate was sieved into a 200 mesh powder and calcined in a muffle
furnace at 600 °C for 2 h to obtain TiO2/PO43–.17

2.3 Preparation of PVC Material
The compositions
of the PVC composites are given in Table 1. The 100 phr PVC resin, 40 phr DOP, 2 phr
stabilizers (represented by lead sulfate tribasic and dibasic lead
phosphite, respectively) each, 0.5 phr lubricant (calcium stearate),
4 wt % based on the total weight of the flame retardant (represented
by solid superacid and antimonous oxide) were dry-blended well. PVC
composites were blended in a two-roll mill at 150–160 °C
for 10 min, and then the composites were introduced into a flat vulcanizing
machine for compression at 165 °C, 12 MPa for 6 min. The sheets
were formed after compression. Composites for testing were cut from
the molded PVC sheet after a certain amount of time.

2.4 Characterization
and Analysis
2.4.1 X-ray Diffraction
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements were used to characterize TiO2/PO43– using a D/Max-3c X-ray diffractometer
(D8-ADVANCE, Bruker) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å,
40 kV, 50 mA) using a diffractometer. The diffraction angle was collected
in the 2θ range from 10° to 90° in steps of 1.2°
for 1 min.

2.4.2 Limiting Oxygen Index
The LOI values
were measured on a JF-3 LOI apparatus (Nanjing Jiangning Analytical
Instrument Co. Ltd., China). The size of each specimen was 100 ×
10 × 3 mm3 according to ASTM D 2863-97. Each specimen
was prepared and repeated three times.

2.4.3 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out using a HCT-2 thermal analyzer (Beijing
Hengjiu Scientific Instrument Factory) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under nitrogen atmosphere. The weight of each sample was 7–9
mg. The range of temperature was from 25 to 700 °C.

2.4.4 FT-IR Spectroscopy
About 8 mg of
each PVC compound was heated from 200 to 700 °C at a heating
rate of 15 °C/min under N2. Then, the PVC residues
at different temperatures were analyzed by an FTS 2000 Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) (Varian) instrument. The FT-IR spectra in the range
of 4000–400 cm–1 were recorded with KBr powder.

2.4.5 Cone Calorimeter Test
The cone
calorimeter test (CCT) values were obtained by PX-07-007 (Phoenix
Quality Inspection Instrument Co., Ltd.) under an external heat flux
of 50 kW/m2. The specimen size was 100 × 100 ×
3 mm3 according to ISO5660.

2.4.6 Scanning
Electron Microscope
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the residue char layer surface
after the Cone test were obtained by KYKYEM-3200 (China). All the
samples need to be sprayed with gold before testing.

2.4.7 Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer
Energy-Dispersive Spectrometry
(EDS) analysis was performed on a
KYKYEM-3200SEM at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 X-ray Diffraction
Phase identification
of the prepared catalysts is performed by XRD, as shown in Figure 1. XRD analysis revealed
that TiO2/PO43– influences
the crystal structure of TiO2. According to the PDF CARDS,
TiO2/PO43– exhibited intense
diffraction lines at 2θ = 25.3° (101), 37.8° (004),
48.0° (200), 55.07° (211), 62.6° (204), 70.3°
(220), 75.1° (215) and 82.7° (224) respectively, which are
all in good agreement with JCPDS-21-1272.18Figure 1 shows that
P ions incorporated into the TiO2 crystal lattice or existed
as PO43– on the surface of TiO2. The P ions are highly dispersed on the surface.19 In addition, the doped P ions stabilize the structure of
anatase and restrain the transformation of anatase to rutile and the
growth of TiO2 crystallite.20 Further, PO43– solidifies the anatase
crystal of the catalyst, and the anatase crystal contributes to the
improvement of TiO2/PO43– activity.

Elemental
compositions of TiO2/PO43– are investigated by elemental analysis in Figure 2. From Table 2, it can be seen that there are lots of details of
EDS analysis results. The elements Ti and P of TiO2/PO43– are 36.31 and 8.54%.

3.3 Limiting Oxygen Index
The PVC formulation
containing the studied Sb2O3 was compared with
TiO2/PO43– and Sb2O3 in this study, and the LOI values of neat PVC (PVC-0),
PVC/Sb2O3 (PVC-1), PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) (PVC-2) are
shown in Table 1. The
LOI value of neat PVC was only 26.3%, indicating its poor flame-retardant
property. Compared with PVC-0, the LOI value of PVC is gradually increased
when the amount of flame retardant Sb2O3 is
increased. When the amount of Sb2O3 is 6 phr,
the LOI increases from 26.3 to 31.8%. Whereas the addition of TiO2/PO43– greatly improves PVC’s
flame-retardant performance. The LOI value of PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) is significantly
improved to 32.3%, which is the highest in all PVC composites as shown
in Table 1. Therefore,
it indicates that the TiO2/PO43– solid superacid has a good synergistic effect with Sb2O3 in PVC.

3.4 Cone Calorimeter Test
The flammability
of polymer materials is commonly characterized by a cone calorimeter,
which is very effective to evaluate their flame-retardant properties
under real-world fire conditions.21Figures 3–6 show the
curves of the heat release rate (HRR), total heat released (THR),
the smoke production rate (SPR), total smoke produced (TSP), CO yield
profile, CO2 yield profile, and mass loss rate of neat
PVC, PVC/Sb2O3, PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) composites.
The detailed data are listed in Table 3.

Flexible PVC’s HRR curve (Figure 3a) showed that the composite
burnt very violently
after ignition, indicating its tinder property. The peak HRR (PHRR)
is an important parameter to evaluate the intensity of fires.22 It is shown in Figure 3a that neat PVC (PVC-0) is at a higher HRR
for a long time, so its HRR curve shows a broad peak. After the thermal
radiation of the PVC composite, heat begins to be released from it.
Over time, the HRR continues to increase and reaches a PHRR of 288.37
kW/m2 at 75 s, followed by a gradual reduction in the HRR.
The HRR value is close to zero after 350 s, indicating that the basic
burning of neat PVC is completed.4 The
THR of neat PVC increases to the maximum of 50 MJ/s in Figure 3b. In addition, incorporating
6 phr Sb2O3 into PVC makes PHRR and THR decrease
to 257.46 and 45.2 kW/m2, corresponding to a 11 and 10%
reduction compared to neat PVC, respectively. Its TTI (75 s) does
not change significantly. Compared with PVC-0, the HRR curves of the
PVC-2 composite show that the PHRR is reduced significantly in Figure 3a. Their THR is lower
than neat PVC in Figure 3b. Thus, the PHRR and THR for PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) are just 242.54 and 44.5
kW/m2, corresponding to a 16 and 11% reduction to neat
PVC, respectively. These results suggest that TiO2/PO43– and Sb2O3 have
a good synergistic effect on reducing heat release. Furthermore, the
insulating char layer is likely to be formed on the surface of the
PVC matrix during the burning process, and the solid superacid does
not only inhibit the entry of heat and oxygen into the PVC bulk but
also inhibits combustion gases to go out of the PVC bulk. Consequently,
the intensity of combustion pyrolysis reactions is degraded, and the
release of the quantity of heat is also decreased.4

In PVC composites, a substantial amount of harmful
smoke consisting
of carbon particles and hydrogen chloride gases can be produced during
the combustion so that a decrease in smoke release is usually the
most important concern.23 Compared with
neat PVC, the peak SPR (PSPR) and TSP of PVC/Sb2O3 and PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) are all reduced in Figure 4. The regularity, PSPR and TSP (PVC) (0.19
m2·s–2; 33 m2·m–2) > PSPR and TSP (PVC/Sb2O3)
(0.11 m2·s–2; 26 m2·m–2) > PSPR and TSP [PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–)] (0.10 m2·s–2; 24 m2·m–2), is
consistent with HRR and THR. PSPR of Sb2O3 is
lower than that of neat PVC by 42%, which demonstrates that it has
a positive effect on smoke suppression of PVC. In addition, compared
with neat PVC, the PSPR and TSP of PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) are all decreased,
respectively, by 47 and 27%, which is a synergistic smoke suppression
of TiO2/PO43– solid superacid
and Sb2O3.

The amount of CO and CO2 released is also an important
indicator for evaluating the flame retardancy of PVC composites. The
gaseous toxic products produced by the combustion of PVC composites
are CO and CO2.24 From Figure 5a,b and Table 3, clearly the CO2 content of the neat PVC is the largest, whereas pure PVC
has the least CO content, indicating that the neat PVC is flammable
and completely burns during radiant heat to release a large amount
of CO2. Compared with the neat PVC, the curves of PVC-1
and PVC-2 show a significant increase in CO production, indicating
that PVC is not completely burned because of the addition of the flame
retardant.25 PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) have lower
toxic gas production than PVC/Sb2O3.

Figure 6 shows the
mass loss as a function of combustion time. The increase in char residue
of PVC-1 and PVC-2 compared with that of PVC-0 was consistent with
the results in the LOI test that demonstrated that the solid superacid
and Sb2O3 might promote early cross-linking
of PVC to form a char layer which limited the heat and mass exchange
between the gas and solid phases, as a result contributing to the
flame retardancy.26 Combined with the above
results, the flame-retardant performance and smoke suppression property
of PVC can be improved by the synergistic effect of TiO2/PO43– and Sb2O3.

3.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis
As can
be seen from Figures 7–9 and Table 4, the TGA results
(curves of TG and differential thermal gravimetric (DTG) analysis)
of the PVC composite system in neat nitrogen atmosphere from ambient
temperature up to 700 °C and the calculated typical data are
shown.27 The initial decomposition temperature
(Ti) is the temperature at which 5% of
the PVC composite is thermally degraded, and Tmax is the temperature at which the degradation rate reaches
a maximum.

Many papers
have reported28−30 on the thermal degradation of
PVC. According to these reports, the curves of thermal degradation
can be divided into two stages of weight loss. The first stage of
weight loss in the temperature range of 200–380 °C is
mainly the decomposition of PVC to remove HCl and DOP. It can be seen
from Table 4 that all
the samples lost weight, about 60–70 wt %, at the first stage.
In fact, for the sample of plasticized PVC without fire-retardant
additives, just over 70 wt % is lost, with somewhat smaller losses
for the samples that were treated with flame retardants. In addition,
incorporation of a small amount of Sb2O3 or
Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) reduces the Tmax in the first stage.
From Figures 8 and 9, it can be found that PVC/Sb2O3 and PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) have a similar Ti, which is a little lower than that of the neat composites.

The second weightlessness stage beyond 430 °C is mainly caused
by the cross-linking reaction after the formation of conjugate polyene
cyclization after the removal of HCl, which is caused by the volatilization
of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds.31 At
the second stage of the TG curves, the PVC compounds containing Sb2O3 or Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) also have smaller weight losses
than that of the other composites. The Tmax is lower than that of the neat PVC compound. It can be seen that
the average residual char of PVC/Sb2O3 (17.5%)
is 7% higher than that of neat PVC (10.5%). In addition, the average
residual char of PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) is 18.9%, and its residual char at different
heating rates is higher than that of others. All the results are due
to the Sb2O3 and TiO2/PO43– changing the pattern of thermal degradation
and promoting early dehydrochlorination and cross-linking and early
formation of char.

The effect of TiO2/PO43– is obviously not only due to the above reasons,
but also due to
the following reasons. The TiO2 reacts with free hydrochloric
acid to form strong Lewis acid TiCl4 that can rise to catalyst
activity and promote the early cross-linking of the PVC; then, it
quickly forms charcoal. The TiCl4 alkylates with another
PVC molecule, and it gives off HCl so as to cause an autocatalytic
reaction. The HCl released is an effective gas phase flame inhibitor,
and PVC molecules are highly crossl-inked to form carbon films, which
play the role of heat insulation and oxygen insulation.32 The process is demonstrated with TiO2 in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Mechanism
diagram of Lewis acid production and the flame-retardant.

The thermal degradation kinetics of all PVC compounds
was studied
by the equation of Kissinger.33 The equation
is as follows  

Tm is the maximum temperature at the
peak position in K, Φ is the rate of temperature increase in
K/min (Φ = 5,10,15,20), R is the gas constant
[8.314 J/(mol·K)], and Ea is the
decomposition activation energy. From the slope of the plot of ln(1/Tm2) versus 1/Tm in Figure 11, the activation energy can be calculated, that is, Ea = −R × slope.34 In Table 4, Ea of neat PVC is 111.90 kJ/mol,
whereas incorporating Sb2O3 or Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) into the PVC generates an Ea increase
to 154.62 and 134.47 kJ/mol, corresponding to a 38 and 20% increase
compared to neat PVC, respectively, which shows that Sb2O3 has better efficiency to improve the thermal stability
of PVC, and TiO2/PO43– is
added as a catalyst to catalyze the pyrolysis of PVC composites, which
is thermally degraded in advance and reduces the reaction energy.
Therefore, combined with the LOI value, synergistic flame retardancy
of TiO2/PO43– and Sb2O3 is good.

TG data of PVC specimens
at different heating.

3.6 FT-IR Analysis of the Residues Heated to Specific
Temperatures
The radical group of PVC was analyzed by FT-IR
of the Residues Heated to Specific Temperatures. Figures 12–14 show the FT-IR absorption spectra for
the samples of neat PVC, PVC/Sb2O3, PVC/Sb2O3/TiO2/PO43–. The appearance of the absorption at approximately 3432 cm–1 proves the stretching vibration of intermolecular hydrogen bonding
with O–H in Figure 12. The multiple peaks at 2968/2925/2852/1429 cm–1 correspond to stretching mode and flexural vibration of CH in CH3 and CH2. As the temperature increases, the peak
increases to a maximum at 400 °C and then gradually disappears.
In addition, the absorption peaks at 1040–1311 and 1717 cm–1 could be assigned to the ester group and C=O
bonds, respectively, which could possibly be attributed to the presence
of DOP.35 It can be seen that bands appear
at 1450–1675 cm–1 that correspond to the
stretching vibration of olefins and the benzene ring skeleton in C=C.
The peak area of C=C first increases, then decreases and becomes
stable in 600 °C. The PVC is characterized by a peak at 619 cm–1 because of the absorption of the C–Cl stretching
vibration.36

neat PVC specimens obtained at specific temperatures.

Figure 13 FT-IR spectra of the PVC/Sb2O3 specimens
obtained at specific temperatures.

Figure 14 FT-IR spectra of the PVC/Sb2O3/TiO2/PO43– specimens obtained at specific
temperatures.

According to neat PVC
data analysis, it is obvious that it has
a series of differences as shown in Figures 13,14. Polyols were
produced during the cracking of PVC. As the temperature increased,
the hydroxyl peak in PVC/Sb2O3 is consistent
with the neat PVC, whereas the hydroxyl of PVC/Sb2O3/TiO2/PO43– remained
stable at 500 °C. In addition, the CH2 and CH3 decrease early and are little left for PVC-1 and PVC-2, indicating
Sb2O3/TiO2/PO43– prompts PVC to early decompose. What is more, the C=C peak
area of TiO2/PO43– is bigger
than that of the others in 700 °C. To sum up, it shows that the
hydroxyl group on the surface of carbon residue is very stable at
high temperature. Therefore, high temperature residual carbon mainly
contains double bonds and hydroxyl groups. The results that TiO2/PO43– prompts PVC to decompose
early and stabilize are consistent with TG.

3.7 Scanning
Electron Microscope
The
surface morphology of the char residues collected after the cone calorimeter
test is also investigated with SEM. The SEM image of the char residue
after burning of PVC-0 in Figure 15 shows that the morphology of the neat PVC had a honeycomb
structure with many tiny pores, which cannot effectively isolate oxygen
and heat. Therefore, heat and oxygen can flow freely in and out
of the PVC substrate interior when the PVC burns.

composites.

Figures 15 and 16 show that
the char layer structure of PVC/Sb2O3 has considerable
continuity and toughness, and
it is not easy to be broken. When the PVC composites are lit, the
char of the PVC/Sb2O3 composites is likely to
effectively isolate oxygen and heat exchange. Therefore, Sb2O3 is very useful for improving the flame-retardant performance
of PVC.

Comparing with the SEM photograph
of the char residue on the outer
surface after neat PVC combustion in Figure 15, it can be seen that the char layer structure
of PVC/Sb2O3(TiO2/PO43–) composite combustion (Figure 17) is the smoothest, no pores appear
denser, and it is more compact. This structure prevents exchange of
heat and oxygen during PVC combustion, and then it can enhance the
flame-retardant performance. Therefore, TiO2/PO43– solid superacid has good flame retardancy.

images of PVC/Sb2O3/TiO2/PO43– composites.

In comparison, the char layer on the surface of the PVC/flame-retardant
composites is dense and continuous after combustion, which exhibit
a no-holes and honeycomb structure. Therefore, flammable gas cannot
easily penetrate through such a barrier.

4 Conclusions
In this study, a novel TiO2/PO43– solid superacid was successfully synthesized, which showed applicability
as a flame retardancy synergist for the PVC/Sb2O3 system. The solid superacid was introduced to reduce the amount
of Sb2O3 and improve the flame-retardant efficiency.
The morphological characterization showed that the PO43– is well distributed on the surface of TiO2. By analyzing the LOI, the LOI value of neat PVC is only 23.6%,
whereas the PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) composites have the highest LOI value
of 32.2%. In addition, the PHRR, THR, SPR, and TSP values for PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) are significantly reduced in the CCT compared to those of others.

In-depth analysis on the thermal degradation of flexible PVC is
done by TG in air atmosphere. Ea of neat
PVC is 107.02 kJ/mol while incorporating Sb2O3 or Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) into PVC generates Ea increase to 139.75 and 124.89 kJ/mol, corresponding to a 31 and
17% increase compared to neat PVC, respectively. The Tmax, DTG peak value, and char residue of PVC/Sb2O3/(TiO2/PO43–) is higher than those of others. The solid superacid catalyzed its
thermal degradation to form the Lewis acid, which promoted its esterification
and cross-linking. The results showed that the flame-retardant could
improve the thermal stability of the char residue and flame retardancy
of the PVC. The high-temperature residual carbon mainly contains double
bonds and hydroxyl groups by FT-IR. The peak area of PVC/Sb2O3/TiO2/PO43– is
bigger than those of others at 700 °C. Furthermore, from the
SEM analysis, the TiO2/PO43– superacid promotes the dehydration, pyrolysis, and cross-linking
of PVC into charcoal, and together with Sb2O3 forms a continuous char layer, which can effectively isolate oxygen
and heat and effectively protect the PVC. Hence, the synergistic flame
retardant and smoke suppression effect of the TiO2/PO43– solid superacid and Sb2O3 is remarkable.
