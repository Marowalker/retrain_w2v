Reaction–diffusion
waves and stationary Turing patterns
are observed in closed two-layer gel reactors, where the two compartments
are initially filled with complementary sets of reactants of the chlorine
dioxide–iodine–malonic acid–poly(vinyl alcohol)
reaction. The asymmetrical loading generates concentration gradients
and the patterns form at the interface between the two parts. These
easy-to-perform experiments allow us to study a wide range of dynamical
phenomena without requiring a specific reactor design or the use of
sophisticated equipment. To get complementary information on pattern
formation in parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the concentration
gradients, two geometrically different configurations of compartments
are presented. We demonstrate that three variants of the initial distribution
of the chemicals can be equally applied, and this flexibility provides
a way to introduce additional reagents to perturb the dynamics of
the systems. A noticeable increase in the wavelength of Turing patterns
and in the period of waves has been induced by adding bromide ions.
The interaction of Turing and Hopf modes has been observed as a result
of not only the variation of the initial poly(vinyl alcohol) concentration
but that of the gradients as well.

1 Introduction
The
conscious design of complex chemical systems, which can be
used to model and mimic natural biology, is a challenging problem.1−3 Nonlinear reactions and diffusive transport are often used as building
blocks of such development. The thoughtful study of reaction–diffusion
(RD) systems requires the use of well-defined reactor configurations,
which allow us to investigate different aspects of the pattern formation
dynamics, for example, the sensitivity to the initial and boundary
conditions. The chlorite–iodide–malonic acid (CIMA)
and its variant, the chlorine dioxide–iodine–malonic
acid (CDIMA) batch chemical oscillators,4 are preferably used to investigate RD phenomena because of their
well-described kinetics and advantageous experimental characteristics
such as robustness and reproducibility. The CIMA and CDIMA RD systems
have been typically studied in open spatial gel reactors which allow
us to maintain the system at controlled distance from thermodynamic
equilibrium.5 Although, these experiments
require sophisticated equipment and special constructions, the formation
of sustained structures facilitates the evaluation of the results.
The most often used open reactor configurations are the one-side-fed
reactor (OSFR) and two-side-fed reactor (TSFR), where the RD medium,
for example, a piece of hydrogel, is fed by fresh chemicals from one
or two outer compartments. In an OSFR, the gel exchanges chemicals
through a single face with an open reservoir, which is fed by the
initial reagents. In a TSFR, the gel is sandwiched between two open
tanks, which are supplied by complementary sets of reactants. TSFRs
have been used to create patterns in the CIMA RD system,6−10 whereas in the CDIMA case, the OSFR geometry has been preferred.11−13 These two geometries have different advantages and disadvantages,5 but versatile RD patterns, for example, 2D and
3D spot patterns, symmetric triangles, hexabands, stripes, antisynchronous
waves, spirals, and Turing–Hopf spirals, have been found in
both of them.

Experiments in closed reactors definitely require
simpler setups
but allow only the formation of transient phenomena. Because of the
special batch oscillatory properties of the CDIMA and CIMA reactions,
trigger waves,14 interacting hexagons,
and network-like structures15 can be observed
in a thin, unstirred liquid layer, for example, in a Petri dish. Recently,
a new configuration where two pieces of gel are loaded homogeneously
with subsets of a nonlinear chemical system has been suggested to
study the formation of a localized pattern zone in a gradient of chemical
composition.16,17 The reactants meet by diffusion
and a reaction zone develops at the cross-gradients of the chemicals.
A closed two-layer setup can be easily mounted which facilitates its
widespread use, and the complementary gel halves serve as transitory
reagent sources for the middle reaction zone. This provides better
control on the dynamics of the patterning zone, contrary to an unstirred
liquid layer, and enables to maintain the self-organized structures
for considerably longer times. In this configuration, the dynamics
of autocatalytic and oscillatory-type reacting systems have been investigated.18 According to the theoretical and the corresponding
numerical studies, the formation of fronts, spatially localized waves,
Turing patterns, and complex spatiotemporal behavior is predicted
as a result of the interaction of the Hopf and Turing modes.16,17 The front and wave dynamics could be realized in appropriate experiments
by using the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction,18 but was not possible for Turing-type patterns
with this reaction. Here, we investigate the CDIMA reaction which
appeared as a good candidate to produce not only waves but also Turing
patterns in such closed two-layer setups.

The core of the mechanism
of the CDIMA reaction can be written
by reactions (R1–R3). The model19 describes a substrate inhibition
mechanism, where iodide and chlorite play the role of the activator
and the inhibitor, respectively. R1  Here
MA and IMA for for malonic acid and iodomalonic
acid. R2   R3   R4  This system is capable of
forming stationary
Turing patterns in RD systems if the effective relative diffusivity
of the I– species is decreased by immobilizing macromolecular
agents such as starch or poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), which are capable
of complexing I3– ions formed in R4.

In this work, I2, MA, and in some
cases ClO2 are the initially separated components, whereas
the other reactants
(H2SO4 and PVA) are distributed equally in both
sides. We study three types of initial conditions depending on the
placing of ClO2, as it can be introduced equally on both
sides (Figure 1a) or
to either of the sides (Figure 1b,c). The two sides are homogeneously loaded with the indicated
reactants, and when these are connected, counter-diffusion leads to
the formation of a reaction zone in the middle. In this zone, the
initial separation of I2 and MA evokes the localized formation
of the activator in reaction R1, which produces
a reversible complex complex with PVA. Because the effective diffusivity
of ClO2 remains unchanged, it fills up the middle zone
and exerts inhibition (R2 and R3) both in symmetric and in asymmetric initial ClO2 distributions. However, the elimination of ClO2 from
one side enables to introduce other species (e.g., halide ions20) to that side to affect the dynamics. The patterns
of the middle zone have been studied from two different directions,
perpendicular and parallel to the concentration gradients in the side-by-side
(SbS, Figure 1e) and
in the top-and-bottom (TaB, Figure 1f) configurations. We present an experimental route
to generate the theoretically predicted16 waves and stationary Turing-type patterns in the closed two-layer
configurations by using the CDIMA reaction, a reaction that can produce
batch oscillatory dynamics as the BZ reaction.

two-layer gel reactors used in the experiments.

the setup (d), and the experimental configurations: SbS (e) and TaB

A and B are homogeneously loaded with different sets of reactants
of the CDIMA reaction and connected to start the experiment. The dimensions
of the gel pieces are: lx = 16 mm, ly = 30 mm,
and lz = 2.8 mm.

2 Results and Discussion
We start with the effects of the initial distribution of the chemicals
between the two gels, especially the placing of ClO2. Prior
to any reactions, without ClO2, side A is reddish-purple
(λmax = 490 nm, dark in the pictures, Figure 2b) because of the PVA–I3– complex, which is formed in a small amount
thanks to the I– traces in the iodine solution.
If ClO2 is added to side A, it oxidizes nearly all the
I–, and the intense color of the complex disappears.
In this case, the color of side A is orangish (light in the pictures, Figure 2a,c). Side B is slightly
greenish-yellow because of ClO2, which appears to be of
the same light color in the pictures (Figure 2a–c). On the time scale of the filling
of the gel pieces (about 3 h), we have not observed any other significant
reactions in side A nor B.

plots (from t = 0) in the case of different initial
ClO2 distributions

The dot-ended lines show the (x,t) sections of the corresponding figures of (d–f). Snapshots
of the forming multilayer spot-like patterns in the x–y plane at t = 45 min (d), t = 103 min (e), and t = 60 min (f). Concentrations:
[PVA]0 = 3 g/L.

The experiment starts when side A and B are connected (t = 0). At first, we discuss the results found in the SbS
configuration (Figure 1e). In the case, when ClO2 is present in both sides, the
I– production leads to the formation of a dark reaction
zone in the middle, bounded by a pair of fronts indicated by α
and β in Figure 2a. The β-type front, which is less sharp and propagates into
side B, can be identified in all the used distributions of ClO2 (Figure 2a–c).
On the contrary, front α cannot be seen in the case when ClO2 is added only to side B (Figure 2b). In every case, because of the applied
[MA]0/[I2]0 ratio, the visible reaction
zone propagates to the direction of side A. However, when the ClO2 distribution is asymmetric, a prior front (γb or γc in Figure 2b,c) develops following the direction of the diffusion
of ClO2. The preliminary front starts immediately at the
beginning of the experiment and is followed by α and β
with a time-lag of 5–7 min, which is typical in all cases.
According to the observed color, fronts α, β, and γc are characterized by I– production. On
the contrary, γb is governed by the diffusion of
ClO2 toward side A, and the light color is the result of
the consumption of the I– traces by ClO2 (Figure 2c). The
concentration gradients determine the spatial extent of the range
of Turing instability in all the three cases. This domain gets wider
in time, and the stationary structures emerge in succeeding rows along
axis x as it is shown by the parallel light stripes
indicated by arrows in Figure 2a–c. The Turing structures disappear after about 80–120
min at the applied conditions. The stabilized multilayer spot-like
structures in the x–y plane
are shown in Figure 2d–f. In the case of symmetric ClO2 distribution,
the wavelength of the forming pattern is smaller, typically 0.54 ±
0.07 mm (Figure 2d)
compared to the other cases, where it is about 0.81 ± 0.06 and
0.71 ± 0.07 mm (Figure 2e,f), so the zone of Turing instability consists of more rows
of spots at different positions along axis x than
in the latter two cases. This is in accordance with the prior results
made in open spatial gel reactors, where the wavelength of the pattern
increased as the input feed concentration of ClO2 was decreased.11 In the closed two-layer setup, the initial asymmetric
ClO2 distribution results in smaller local ClO2 concentration in the reaction zone compared to the symmetric one.

The patterns forming in the plane perpendicular to the direction
of concentration gradients have been analyzed in the TaB geometry
(Figure 1f). In this
geometry, the recorded pictures are the superposition of the three-dimensional
patterns which form in different layers of the gel.21 In all the three cases of the initial ClO2 distribution,
we have found experimental evidence of spotlike hexagonal patterns
(Figure 3). However,
in Figure 3b, the patterns
cannot be stabilized and are less visible because of the high color
contrast between sides A and B. The spots can evolve from concentric
target-like patterns (Figure 3a, t = 15 min) or from a cellular structure
(Figure 3c, t = 30 min), but the time needed to reach a quasi-regularly
ordered pattern is almost the same (50 min) in both cases. The wavelength
of the spotlike structures typically does not change during the stabilization
as can be seen, for example, by comparing the snapshots taken at 30
and 60 min in Figure 3a. In accordance with the SbS measurements, in cases of asymmetric
ClO2 distributions, the wavelength of the forming pattern
is about 1.5 times larger than in the case of the symmetric ClO2 distribution [compare λ = 0.73 ± 0.07 mm at t = 60 min (Figure 3c) with λ = 0.54 ± 0.08 mm at t = 50 min (Figure 3a)].

Figure 3 Results in the TaB experimental setup: The formation and stabilization
of hexagonally ordered spots is presented on consecutive snapshots
in the cases when ClO2 is on both sides (a), when ClO2 is added only to side B (b), and when ClO2 is
added only to side A (c). Concentrations: [PVA]0 = 3 g/L.

At this point, we are ready to
test the recently published method
of adding halide ions to the CDIMA system to increase the wavelength
of the Turing patterns.20 Although, it
was originally used to modify patterns in a one-side-fed open reactor,
we found that it can be applied in closed two-layer systems as well.
We have chosen Br– ions, which were added to the
ClO2-free initial side to avoid the oxidation of Br– by ClO2 during the soaking of the gel pieces.
The kinetic role of Br– ions is basically to consume
ClO2– ions according to reaction R5.22 R5  A considerable increase of wavelength has
been observed in cases of both asymmetric initial ClO2 distributions,
but in the case when ClO2 is added only to side B, the
patterns are less uniform and less visible (Figure 4a) than in the second case (Figure 4b). In the first case, the
formation of stripes has been observed besides the spotlike pattern
at [Br–]0 = 1.25 mM (Figure 4a). The dependence of the resulting
increased wavelength on the initial [Br–]0 is almost the same in the case of both presented ClO2 distributions (Figure 4c). Figure 4d shows
the temporal evolution of the patterns in a selected case: the appearance
of the stationary structures takes two times longer than in the bromide
free case (Figure 3b), but the increased wavelengths are also constant in time for about
40 min.

Figure 4 Results in the TaB experimental setup in the presence of [Br–]0 which was added to the ClO2-free initial side. The evolving patterns are shown in the x–y plane in the cases when ClO2 is added only to side B (a) and when ClO2 is added
only to side A (b). The snapshots were made in different experiments
at 55, 60, and 90 min (a) and at 60, 70, and 76 min (b), respectively.

of the stationary structures at [Br–]0 = 0.31 mM when ClO2 is added only to side B (d). Concentrations:
[PVA]0 = 3 g/L.

Besides the stationary Turing patterns, RD systems of the
CDIMA
reaction are also capable of producing time-periodic wave phenomena.
According to the previous experimental observations, the formation
of waves is expected at low PVA concentration.11 We have observed
two different kinds of waves in the six experimental configurations
at [PVA]0 = 1 g/L, without additional Br– ions. Type I waves are typical in the two asymmetric ClO2 distributions and appear at the beginning of the experiments as
in-phase oscillations starting from several initial spots. On the
time-space plot (Figure 5a), these waves show up as parallel vertical lines with a period
of T = 3.8 min (beginning of section 1). During the
first period of waves, the reaction zone is necessarily thin, and
the Turing and Hopf instabilities occur in the same layer, therefore
these modes strongly interact with each other.9 Thus, the forming spots are erased by the wave at t = 4 min, which is a full line in the time-space plot. As the reaction
zone is getting wider, the interaction weakens and the waves and spots
are formed separately along the direction of the concentration gradients.
Accordingly, these structures are superimposed after t = 12 min and oscillations appear as regularly spaced segmented lines
in the time-space plot. In section 2, the oscillatory behavior vanishes,
but the spotlike patterns remain stationary. In section 3, the slow
disappearance of Turing structures is accompanied by type II waves
which are typical in all applied ClO2 distributions, both
in TaB and SbS configurations. The period of them, which depends on
the experimental setup, is almost the same as that of type I waves,
but contrary to type I, these are spiral waves (Figure 5b), which annihilate when they collide. As
it is shown in the x–y representation
of Figure 5b, the spirals
may coexist with the Turing structures without obvious mutual perturbation.
The interaction of these two phenomena has been investigated along
the direction of the concentration gradients in the SbS geometry (Figure 5c). Comparing Figures 2a and 5c, we can conclude that the waves and the last row of Turing
spots are formed in different layers. In accordance with previous
open gel reactor experiments,10 the waves
appear toward side B, where the local MA concentration values are
higher. The unperturbed coexistence and the spatial separation of
the oscillatory and stationary behaviors imply again a weak interaction
between Turing and Hopf modes under the investigated conditions.9 By varying the initial concentration of MA in
side B, the stationary and oscillatory behaviors have been established
separately. At small [MA]0 values only spots, at high [MA]0 only waves have been found.

Figure 5 Waves at [PVA]0 = 1 g/L without
adding NaBr to the initial
solutions. Results in the TaB configuration: time-space plot in the
case when ClO2 was added only to side A (a). The contrast
was manipulated differently in the two sides separated by a dotted
line. Sections #1–3 indicate different types of behaviors.

when ClO2 was added to both sides (b). The waves are indicated
by arrows. Results in the SbS configuration: layers of the oscillatory
and Turing phenomena on a time-space plot made in the case when ClO2 was added to both sides (c).

We have investigated the combined effect of the smaller initial
[PVA]0 and the addition of Br– ions to
the ClO2-free side. The experiments were carried out in
the TaB configuration in the cases of both asymmetric ClO2 distributions. As it has been expected from our previous results,
we have seen waves and a remarkable increase of the wavelength of
the stationary structures. However, as a new aspect, which was not
reported before, we have found that the period of waves also increased
during the experiments in the presence of Br– ions.
In the case when ClO2 was added only to side B, the stationary
patterns have emerged from an oscillatory state through the formation
of target-like patterns (Figure 6a). The wavelength of the resulting quasi-hexagonally
ordered spots was λ = 0.97 ± 0.09 mm. In Figure 6b, at t =
20 min, it is clearly visible that the oscillations of the surrounding
region do not penetrate to the domain of stationary patterns. At t = 30 min, the waves become dominant in this region as
well, which manifests as the superimposition of Turing and wave phenomena
in the x–y plane. The period
of waves increased from T = 3.4 to 5.4 min in 1 h.
However, in the case when ClO2 was added only to side A,
the wavelength of the Turing spots changed significantly during the
measurement (Figure 6c, λ = 0.68 ± 0.07 mm at t = 12 min,
λ = 0.77 ± 0.07 mm at t = 26 min). This
alteration is connected to the intense wave phenomenon which started
at t = 10 min in a localized domain (Figure 6d) with a period of 3.0 min
and then spread in the whole setup, finally reaching the period of
5.3 min. The existence of Turing patterns is shorter than in the previous
case, and the disappearance of them is accompanied by the organization
simple waves to spiral waves (t = 58 min, Figure 6c). The special wave-spot
behaviors (i.e., nonpenetrating waves and change in the wavelength)
in the presence of smaller [PVA]0 and [Br–]0 indicate a more expressed interaction between Turing
and Hopf instabilities than in the previous cases.

3 Conclusions
We have created RD waves and Turing structures with the prototypical
CDIMA reaction in an innovative gel reactor configuration. This is
a closed two-layer gel geometry, which sets the initial condition
on concentrations such that the active reactants are separated at t = 0 between the two-halves of the system. This arrangement
establishes antagonistic concentration gradients along the direction
of diffusion, which is a universal route to pattern formation by means
of the spatial localization of the undergoing reactions.23 The use of hydrogels as a medium allows us to
study pure RD phenomena as the gel matrix avoids any macroscopic fluid
motion. Accordingly, the effect of gravity plays no role in this reactor
configuration. Naturally, in the above case only transient pattern
formation can be observed. In the CDIMA reaction, because of the slow
consumption of the initial reagents, this transient period is long
enough to allow the development of different RD phenomena. Recently,
these kinds of reactors have raised interest, and numerical works
have predicted the existence of Turing and Hopf instabilities in them,
when they can exhibit a transient batch oscillatory behavior.16,17 The predicted wave phenomena have been successfully reproduced in
experiments with the BZ reaction,18 but
here we show experimental verification for both the time-periodic
and stationary behaviors. Our findings presented in time-space plots
are in good agreement with previous simulated ones.16

A key point of this approach is the appropriate separation
of the
initial reactants to maintain well-defined initial and boundary conditions.
In classic TSFR experiments, the reagents of the CIMA reaction are
distributed as follows: ClO2– and IO3– are fed on one side while MA and I– are fed on the other.10 This arrangement results in gradually changing oxidizing capacity
in the gel by the separation of the oxidant (ClO2–) and the reductant (MA)
and avoids any reactions at the boundaries. On the contrary, in our
work we decided to use the CDIMA reaction as it is the minimal version
of CIMA. In a closed system, it may be auspicious to choose the CDIMA
variant to minimize the induction period. In this case, the analogue
of the abovementioned distribution cannot be used since MA and I2 must be separated in different pools to avoid reaction R1. Our work confirmed that the applied initial distribution
(ClO2, I2, H2SO4, PVA//ClO2, MA, H2SO4, and PVA) results in localized
Turing patterns, parallel to the contact zone.

Our experimental
findings verify the fact that the two-layer gel
reactors are able to produce as diverse RD phenomena as have been
generated in previous open reactor works in other reactor configurations.
The two-layer setup creates cross-gradients of reagents similar to
the situation found in a two-side-fed open reactor. The closed configuration
does not allow us to produce sustained patterns such as in a TSFR
but because of the advantageous batch oscillatory properties of the
CDIMA reaction, the transient batch dynamics develop for a period
of time long enough to distinguish a large series of unusual stationary
and dynamic patterns. In our experiments, the Turing patterns can
be observed at least for 30 min. This fact and the very significant
simplicity of the experimental setup justify the application of the
batch two-layer gel system. We confirm, in batch conditions, experimental
evidence of the interaction of Turing and Hopf instabilities by using
smaller initial amounts of PVA.9,26 The nature of this
phenomenon depends on the width of the localized reaction zone, so
it changes during one measurement. We have found that the waves appear
in two distinct time domains which may be the result of the multiple
and continuously changing concentration gradients. To clarify the
origin of the arising instabilities, numerical simulations are needed.
The dependence of the wavelength of the patterns on the addition of
bromide ions was positively tested. We have observed a remarkable
increase, not only in the case of stationary patterns but in the case
of waves as well. This is in accordance with the previous result that
the wavelength of Turing patterns is proportional to the square root
of the periods of oscillations just beyond the Hopf bifurcation.24

Because of its technical simplicity, the
two-layer gel reactors
can be appropriately used to establish demonstration experiments to
illustrate the process of Turing-type pattern formation. The addition
of bromide ions improves the visibility of the pattern by increasing
its wavelength, which is also a desired feature in this context. It
can be used not only with the CDIMA but with other nonlinear chemical
reactions, for example, the BZ reaction18 and Landolt-type pH oscillators25 to
study RD phenomena at special initial and boundary conditions. As
an exclusive feature, it is easy to change the direction of observation
in successive experiments because the switch between SbS and TaB geometries
can be achieved without a hitch.

4 Experimental
Methods
Two pieces of gel, made of 2% agarose (Sigma-Aldrich,
A2929) and
loaded with different sets of chemicals of the CDIMA reaction, were
joined to establish continuously changing cross-gradients of the reactants.
The gels, with the dimensions of 16 mm (lx) × 30 mm (ly) × 2.8 mm (lz), were put together in two different configurations (Figure 1e,f). The initial distribution
of the chemicals was set by soaking the gels in stock solutions I
and II for 3 h at 4 °C in the refrigerator. Solutions I and II
were prepared by using primary (a–h) and secondary (A–D)
solutions. Primary solutions: (a) [H2SO4] =
0.04 M [diluted from 1.0 mol/L standard solution (VWR)], (b) [PVA]
= 12 g/L (Aldrich, 80% hydrolyzed, Mw =
9000–10 000), (c) [NaClO2] = 0.016 M (Fluka,
≥80%), (d) [K2S2O8] = 8 ×
10–3 M (Reanal, alt.), (e) [KIO3] = 9.5
× 10–4 M (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%), (f)
[KI] = 4.56 × 10–3 M (VWR, ≥99%), (g)
[MA] = 0.02 M (Fluka, ≥98%), (h) deionized water. Secondary
solutions were prepared by mixing unit volumes of primary solutions
in the indicated order: (A) unit volumes of (a,c,d) were mixed and
then kept at 80 °C for 15 min, then the mixture was cooled to
4 °C, then a unit volume of (b) was added, and finally this solution
was kept at 4 °C in the refrigerator; (B) unit volumes of (a,b,e,f)
were mixed; (C) unit volumes of (a,b,g,h) were mixed; (D) unit volumes
of (a,b) were mixed with double unit volume of (h). Solutions (B–D)
were kept at room temperature after preparation. The secondary solutions
were prepared freshly for every experiment. In the initial concentration
distribution indicated in Figure 1a, solution I was prepared by mixing 4 mL (A) and 16
mL (B), and solution II was prepared by mixing 4 mL (A), 6 mL (C),
and 10 mL (D). In this case, both the stock solutions I and II contained
equally [H2SO4] = 0.01 M, [PVA] = 3 g/L and
[ClO2] = 8 × 10–3 M, which was produced
in situ in the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of K2S2O8 and NaClO2 (R6). Solution I also contained [I2] = 5.47 ×
10–4 M, which was produced in situ in the reaction
of excess KIO3 and KI (R7), while
solution II contained [MA] = 1.5 × 10–3 M. R6   R7  

In the cases of Figure 1b,c, solution (A) was replaced by (D) on the ClO2-free side. The addition of Br– to the ClO2-free side was implemented by replacing (A) with (D′),
where (D′) contained NaBr dissolved in (D). The concentrations
of PVA and MA have been varied in the experiments, which was achieved
by changing the concentrations of primary solutions (b,g) while the
mixing ratios were the same in the following steps of the recipe.
All solutions were prepared with ion-exchanged water and chemicals
were used without further purification. During the measurements, the
gels were framed by a plastic cover to protect against desiccation.
The measurements were carried out at 11 °C. The pictures were
taken by an AVT Stingray F-033B (14 bit) camera through a 520 nm band
pass filter to provide better contrast and recorded by the Streampix
(Norpix) software. The camera was fixed above the experimental setup,
which was enlightened from beneath by a 1 mW/cm2 white
light-emitting diode (LED) source. Higher irradiance may affect the
pattern characteristics:12 using a 2 mW/cm2 LED source, the lack of Turing patterns has been observed
in our experiments. We used the ImageJ program for image processing.
