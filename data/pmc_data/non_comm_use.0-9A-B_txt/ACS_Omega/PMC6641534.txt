Introduction
The discovery of catalysts
that efficiently facilitate organic
reactions in a stereo-controlled way is the keystone of asymmetric
organic chemistry. The most recent trends point to the emergence of
axially chiral catalysts based on binaphthyl motifs, in particular,
1,1′-binaphthalene-2,2′-diol (BINOL)-derived compounds,
because the chiral unsubstituted BINOL is economically accessible
and serves as a starting point for the successive transformations.
Because of the importance and generality of this type of catalysts,
a wide range of catalytic agents have been prepared with different
substituents. Usually these substituents are aromatic rings substituted
with bulky groups, which play a fundamental role in the catalytic
reactions. However, the insertion of these aromatic rings requires
expensive, laborious synthesis steps. Basically, there are two strategies
to synthesize substituted BINOL derivatives. Both approaches are based
on the preparation of boronic acid or halide groups, followed by cross-coupling,
to incorporate bulky units. For both strategies, one employs large
amounts of organolithium compounds, several synthetic intermediates,
and time for carrying out the necessary purification steps. Furthermore,
these approaches also introduce protecting groups complicating the
synthetic procedure by two additional synthetic steps and their corresponding
purification protocols. Therefore, the development of a synthetic
route that minimizes the synthetic steps maintaining the stereochemistry
of the desired catalyst is an important challenge.

The synthesis
of optically active pure secondary alcohols via the
enantioselective addition of diethylzinc to various aldehydes is a
successful method for testing the effectiveness of chiral ligands.1 These alcohols are key compounds serving as both
starting materials and resolving agents, which are used in the preparation
of pharmaceuticals or intermediates.1,2

These
useful reagents may serve both as starting materials in the
synthesis of single-stereoisomer drugs or intermediates. Recently,
it has been reported that a sterically demanding aryl group at the
3 position of BINOLs significantly improved the catalytic performance
of the chiral titanium catalyst derived from the resulting ligands.3,4 Herein, we describe the implementation of an approach for the fast
simple synthesis of hindered BINOLs bearing bulky alkyl groups at
3 positions (Scheme 1) and their application as ligands for Ti(IV) complexes to lead novel
BINOL-titanium catalysts. These congested BINOLs with bulky tertiary
alkyl substituents exhibit an enhanced chiral activity for the alkylation
of aldehydes with enantioselectivities comparable to or higher than
those achieved with original BINOL.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Optically
Pure (R)-BINOLs 1–5
Results and Discussion
The new (R)-BINOLs bearing bulky tertiary alkyl
groups were prepared with excellent overall yields according to the
route outlined in Scheme 1. The synthesis of 3-substituted BINOLs (R)-1,2,3 was performed in one
step, in the presence of two, three, or four equivalents of 1-adamantanol
and sulfuric acid as the catalyst; these reactions can be made at
the multigram scale because of its high yield (>95%) and easy purification.
Under the mild conditions employed, the stereoconfiguration of BINOL
is maintained. Thus, it was decided to introduce two adamantyl groups
on 6,6′-di-t-butyl-BINOL (4)
using similar conditions as described for BINOL 1. In
this case, the insertion of the bulky groups was carried out in the
3 and 3′ positions yielding the BINOL 5.

The known (R)-6,6′-di-t-butyl-[1,1′-binaphthalene]-2,2′-diol
(4)5 and (R)-6,6′-di(adamantan-1-yl)-[1,1′-binaphthalene]-2,2′-diol
(1)6 were obtained from tert-butyl chloride and 1-adamantanol, respectively, as
described before and applied as a reference for comparative purposes.

To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the highly active catalysts
derived from the ligands BINOLs 1–5 (Scheme 1) and the parent
(R)-BINOL, we examined the enantioselective addition
of diethylzinc to various aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes catalyzed
by Ti(IV) complex (Tables 1–3). This
enantioselective reaction is a known method for the formation of carbon–carbon
bonds,7 which has become recognized as
a standard assay in guiding new ligand development.8,9 Reactions
were carried out by using 2.4 equiv of diethylzinc (1 M solution in
hexane) at room temperature for 1–5 h in the presence of 0.1
equiv of all developed ligands and 3.0 equiv of Ti(OiPr)4 in toluene as the solvent; we started by using
benzaldehyde as a test substrate to examine the efficiency of the
chiral ligands (Table 1).

It has been reported for
several studied catalytic systems that
bulky groups at 6 and 6′ positions exert an increase in the
dihedral angle between both naphthol rings, through repulsion forces,
and a consequence gave an enhanced performance of 6,6′-substituted
BINOLs over parent BINOL as a chiral ligand were observed.10 However, we have observed that for the ethylation
of benzaldehyde, the presence of bulky substituents 6,6′-di-t-butyl or 6,6′-di-adamantyl groups into the BINOL
rings leads not only to higher reactivity but also to similar enantioselectivities
(Table 1) than pristine
BINOL. In view of these results, we sought to test chiral BINOLs 2 and 5 having these bulky groups at 3,3′
positions; since, it is well-known that this substitution dramatically
alters the chiral environment of the substrates’ binding site,
indeed from results, presented in Table 1, one can observe that the non-C2 symmetric trisubstituted BINOL 2 has the best catalytic
performance with excellent yield and enantioselection (entry 2); tetra-substituted
BINOL 5 also show high yield and good enantioselectivity
better than that of BINOLs 4, 1, which give
similar results to that obtained with pristine BINOL. These results
demonstrated that the incorporation of a new adamantyl group in 3
positions on 6,6′-disubstituted BINOLs is essential for high
yields and enantioselections. When the reaction was carried out in
the absence of the ligand, racemic alcohol was obtained.

To
optimize the reaction conditions of the catalytic system, we
achieved a variation of the reaction temperature for the ethylation
reaction of benzaldehyde with (R)-5-[Ti] (Table 2). The relationship
between reaction temperature and enantiomeric excess was investigated
between 0 and 60 °C. For our system, either raising or lowering
the reaction temperature has a deleterious effect on the reaction
selectivity; the enantiomeric excess obtained varies from 70 to 88%.
Such a behavior can be rationalized according to the isoinversion
principle. The occurrence of inversion points is very common through
a variety of selective processes.12 When
the ethylation reaction was carried out at room temperature, an improved
selectivity of 88% ee was obtained; this fact indicates that the isoinversion
temperature is situated around 25 °C. Although the obtained enantiomeric
excess was 88% at the isoinversion temperature, 5-[Ti] remains less effective than its single (R)-BINOL
counterpart; therefore, we chose 2-[Ti] as the catalytic
system to explore the scope of the reaction.

Under the optimized
reaction temperature, 25 °C, the scope
of the present reaction for the enantioselective ethylation of aldehydes
was examined using 2 as the ligand (results in Table 3). 2-[Ti] catalyst showed excellent enantioinduction for a range of aldehydes.
Alcohols generated from ethylation of p-substituted benzaldehydes
result in high yield and enantioselectivity (entries 1–3).
The reaction of electron-rich aldehyde such as p-methoxybenzaldehyde
resulted in high yield and enantioselectivity (entry 3). On the other
hand, o-bromobenzaldehyde exhibited lower enantioselectivity
(entry 4). The alcohol from 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzaldehyde was
obtained in lower yield and requires longer reaction times to complete
the reaction (entry 5). The reaction of aliphatic aldehyde heptanal
proceeded with a relatively good yield to provide the corresponding
alcohol with high enantioselectivity (entry 6); in this case, ethylation
required prolonged reaction times to achieve the whole conversion.

Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared, in one step, new highly efficient
enantiopure (R)-BINOLs bearing tertiary bulky groups
(adamantyl and t-butyl) from commercially available
starting materials. The activity of the chiral titanium catalyst derived
from unsymmetrical 3,6,6′-trisubstituted BINOL-2 is significantly enhanced, and the enantioselectivity reached 99%
in almost 30 min across a range of substrates. Further studies to
incorporate the substituted-BINOLs into a porous polymer network are
in progress now.
