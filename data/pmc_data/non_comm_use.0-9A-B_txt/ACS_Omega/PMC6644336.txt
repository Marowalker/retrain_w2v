The sorption behavior of bisphenol
A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS)
on graphene was investigated and compared with that on activated carbon.
The kinetic studies showed that BPA sorption on graphene or activated
carbon reached equilibrium within 240 min, whereas TCS sorption on
these two materials achieved equilibrium in 60 and 120 min. The maximum
sorption capacity (qm) of BPA on graphene
or activated carbon reached approximately 2.0 × 103 μg/g, which indicated that graphene was not superior to traditional
activated carbon for BPA removal. By contrast, the strong partitioning
ability of TCS on graphene suggested the potential use of graphene
materials to remove TCS from wastewater. Although the pH change from
4.0 to 7.0 did not greatly affect BPA or TCS sorption, the sorption
decreased dramatically when the pH was increased from 7.0 to 9.0.
This phenomenon should be attributed to the establishment of electrostatic
repulsion between anionic BPA (or TCS) molecules and the graphene
(or activated carbon) surface under higher pH conditions. The increase
of ion (NaCl and CaCl2) concentrations may lead to substantial
increase of BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon due to the
salting-out effect. By contrast, ion concentrations had no significant
effect on TCS sorption because of the dominant hydrophobic interaction.

Introduction
Endocrine-disrupting
chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal
care products (PPCPs) are two kinds of compounds which have gained
global attention because of their broad occurrence in aquatic environments
and ability to cause potential harm to humans. EDCs are chemical substances
that cause malfunctions in the endocrine system of humans and animals,
thus, affecting certain functions of the cells.1 Among them, bisphenol A (BPA) attracts broad attention
because of its wide use as a monomer in the production of polycarbonates,
epoxy resins, and other plastics.2 It was
reported that BPA has been widely detected in wastewater, groundwater,
surface water, and even drinking water.3−5 PPCPs are another group
of emerging contaminants with growing attention in recent years because
of their long-term potential risks to drinking water safety and aquatic
organisms. Triclosan (TCS) is among the most frequently detected PPCPs.
It has been used in a large variety of consumer products, including detergents, shampoos,
toothpastes, body washes, deodorants, lotions, and dish washing liquids,6 which is released in large amounts into wastewater
treatment plants and then into surface water.7 TCS is reported to be highly toxic to algae and blocks the enzyme-carrying
proteins of aquatic organisms.8,9 In addition, TCS has
the potential to be transformed into dioxin and EDCs in wastewater
and drinking water systems.10

Graphene
is a one-atom-thick planar sheet of sp2-bonded
carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice.
Since its first isolation in 2004,11 graphene
has attracted broad attention and has become a novel star material
in recent years. Owing to its large surface area,12 extraordinary electronic and mechanical properties,13 excellent mobility of charge carriers,14 and good thermal conductivity,15 graphene has been applied in many fields such as adsorbents,2,16,17 supercapacitors,18 solar cells,19 photocatalysis,20,21 and sensors.22 The promising application
in future and the development of synthesis techniques have led to
large-scale production of graphene materials. It was reported that
the global market for graphene-based materials was approximately $67
million in 2015 and will reach $675 million in 2020 at an annual growth
rate of 58.7%.

A number of studies have shown the excellent
adsorption capability
of graphene-based materials in the removal of pollutants. It was reported
that graphene-based materials (functionalized graphene) showed high
adsorption capacity toward heavy metal ions (such as Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, and Cr6+).23−25 Furthermore, the removal of dyes26−28 from wastewater
using graphene was also widely studied based on the hydrophobic properties
of this material. Compared with other carbonaceous materials, the
advantage of graphene is the selective adsorption ability to aromatic
compounds with benzene rings through strong π–π
interaction.2,29 The π–π bonding
occurs between C=C double bonds or benzene rings of adsorbed
organic molecules and benzene rings on graphene surface via π–π
coupling. Thus, the application of graphene to remove aromatic compounds
from wastewater is expected to be promising.

The goals of this
study were to compare the different sorption
mechanisms of BPA and TCS on graphene and activated carbon. The sorption
kinetics and isotherms were first studied to determine their equilibrium
time and maximum sorption capacities. Furthermore, the effects of
pH and cations (Na+ and Ca2+) on BPA and TCS
sorption by graphene and activated carbon were assessed to explore
their potential interaction mechanisms. The designed experiments were
expected to show the potential efficiency of graphene materials in
the removal of BPA and TCS from water matrix.

Results and Discussion
Sorption
Kinetics
The solute uptake rate controls the
residence time of adsorbate uptake at the solid–solution interface
and is therefore important for understanding the adsorption kinetics
of adsorbates in general. The adsorption kinetics of BPA on graphene
and activated carbon (Figure 1a) indicated that the adsorption process reached equilibrium
within 240 min. By contrast, Figure 1b showed that TCS sorption on graphene and activated
carbon achieved equilibrium in 60 and 120 min, respectively. The rapid
sorption on graphene is an advantage for the potential use of graphene
materials to remove BPA and TCS from wastewater. To better understand
the adsorption kinetics, two commonly used kinetic models, the pseudo-first-order
(eq 1) and pseudo-second-order
equations (eq 2),30,31 were used to fit the kinetic data 1   2  where qe (μg/g)
and qt (μg/g) are
the amounts of BPA or TCS adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbents
(graphene or activated carbon) at equilibrium and at any time (t), respectively. The k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. The rate constants of
the kinetic models along with the
regression coefficients (R2) are listed
in Table 1.

TCS (b) sorption kinetics (test condition: 100 mg/L

For BPA
and TCS sorption kinetics on graphene, the regression coefficient R2 value for the pseudo-second-order model was
much higher than that of the pseudo-first-order model. It indicated
that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model described the sorption
of BPA and TCS on graphene better than the pseudo-first-order model.
This result implies that the rate-limiting step is chemical adsorption
involving electronic forces through sharing or exchange of electrons
between the adsorbent and ionized species as a function of electron
donor or acceptor, respectively, regardless of equilibrium concentrations.32 The same result about BPA sorption on graphene
was also reported by Xu et al.2 However,
our results showed that the k2 value for
BPA sorption on graphene was around 2.1 g/mg·h, which was much
higher than that reported by Xu et al.2 (i.e., 0.033 g/mg·h). The difference may be attributed to the
different initial concentrations used in these two studies. Because
the same graphene concentration was applied, the relatively lower
initial concentration used in our study may lead to a faster sorption
rate. For BPA and TCS sorption kinetics on activated carbon, the data
were fitted well by both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
models. When comparing the sorption kinetics between graphene and
activated carbon, it is found that graphene showed a higher sorption
rate (k1 and k2) toward TCS than activated carbon. However, the sorption rates of
BPA on graphene and activated carbon were generally the same.

Sorption
Isotherms
Sorption isotherms of BPA and TCS
on graphene or activated carbon are shown in Figure 2. Two commonly used isotherm models, the
Langmuir and Freundlich equations33,34 (eqs 3 and 4),
were adopted to describe the experimental data with the obtained constants
summarized in Table 2 3   4  where qe (μg/g)
is the amount of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent at
equilibrium, Ce (μg/L) is the equilibrium
concentration of the adsorbate in solution (μg/g), qm (μg/L) is the maximum sorption capacity, KL (L/μg) is the Langmuir adsorption constant, KF [(μg/g) (μg/L)−n] is the Freundlich adsorption constant, which indicates
the adsorption capacity, and n represents the measure
of the nonlinearity involved.

The sorption
of BPA on graphene or activated carbon was fitted
better with the Langmuir equation than the Freundlich equation, according
to the coefficient of determination (R2) in Table 2. Such
findings may indicate that the sorption of BPA on these two sorbents
is similar to a monolayer coverage behavior based on the assumption
of Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacities (qm) of BPA on graphene and activated carbon are 2.0 ×
103 and 1.9 × 103 μg/g, respectively.
The results suggest that graphene has no superior sorption capacity
toward BPA, and the activated carbon was still a cost-effective sorbent
for BPA removal from wastewater. However, the same qm value does not imply the same mechanism. Indeed, the
sorption of BPA on graphene should be dominated by the π–π
interaction, whereas the sorption on activated carbon is possibly
governed by the hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and π–π
interaction.

The sorption of TCS on graphene was fitted better
with the Freundlich
equation than the Langmuir equation, whereas the sorption on activated
carbon was fitted well with both the Langmuir and Freundlich equations
(Table 2). Behera et
al.6 also reported that the sorption of
TCS was fitted well with both of the two commonly used equations even
under 1 order of magnitude higher initial TCS concentrations than
that in the current study. Compared with activated carbon, graphene
showed a higher sorption affinity toward TCS, based on the sorption
amount at the same initial concentration. To better understand the
sorption behavior of TCS, a linear equation was used to fit the sorption
data and revealed a better result (R2 >
99%) than the Freundlich equation (inset of Figure 2b). This result indicates that a partition-like
behavior of TCS may occur on graphene in addition to the π–π
interaction between benzene rings. The linear sorption behavior may
be attributed to the use of relatively lower TCS initial concentration,
which may indicate the high sorption capacity of TCS on graphene materials.
Thus, the high sorption ability of graphene toward TCS promotes the
potential use of graphene-based materials to remove TCS from wastewater.

pH Effects
The pH is usually a critical factor for
pollutant sorption in water because of its ability to affect the surface
charge of the sorbent and existing form of the sorbate. The effect
of pH on the sorption of BPA and TCS on graphene or activated carbon
is presented in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3a, the pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 had no effect on sorption levels
of BPA on graphene or activated carbon, as the pH changes (from 5.0
to 7.0) had no great effects on the dominant sorption mechanism (π–π
interaction). However, the sorption levels slightly decreased when
the pH increased from 7.0 to 9.0. Given that both graphene and activated
carbon carry negative charges on the surface, the net charge of graphene
and surface charge of activated carbon decreases with the increase
of pH values owing to surface deprotonation. In addition, BPA exists
in its neutral form (or molecular form) under pH < 8 but begins
to deprotonate to a negatively charged form at around pH 8. Thus,
a repulsive electrostatic interaction may be established between bisphenolate
anion and negatively charged surface of graphene (or activated carbon)
as pH was increased above 7.0. This physical interaction would lead
to a reduction in BPA sorption capacity on graphene or activated carbon,
which was shown in our study (Figure 3a). Although it was proposed that higher pH values
would increase π donor ability of the adsorbate and enhance
the π–π interaction,35 our results suggested that the pH effect on the π–π
interaction was limited when compared to the electrostatic interaction.

Figure 3 Effects
of pH on the sorption of BPA (a) and TCS (b) (test condition:
100 mg/L sorbent with 500 μg/L sorbate initial concentration
and 4 h sorption time) on graphene or activated carbon.

The sorption capacities of TCS on graphene or activated
carbon
had little change at pH 5.0–7.0, but they decreased when pH
was increased from 7.0 to 9.0. Such observations resembled the results
of BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon. Since the main driving
forces for TCS sorption on graphene or activated carbon were π–π
interactions, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interaction, our results
suggest that the pH had limited effects on such mechanisms within
the pH range used in this study. The decrease of TCS sorption from
7.0 to 9.0 should also be attributed to the electrostatic repulsions
between TCS anions and surface of graphene or activated carbon established
at higher pH (7.0–9.0).

Ionic Effects
In addition to pH, ionic strength and
cation types are usually critical factors affecting the sorption processes.
In Figure 4a, the sorption
capacities (qe) of BPA on graphene and
activated carbon increased from 1750 to 2500 mg/g and from 2250 to
4750 mg/g, respectively, when the NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations
increased from 0.001 to 0.1 M. On the basis of previous theories,
the ions may affect the sorption of BPA on graphene from three aspects:
(1) the increase of ion concentration can enhance the aggregation
of graphene materials to form a compact structure (squeezing-out effect),
thus reducing the BPA sorption because of the decrease of sorption
sites on the surface; (2) the increase of ionic strength can compress
the double layer on the surface of graphene and then increase the
BPA sorption level because of the electrostatic screening effect;
and (3) the ion concentration increase can facilitate the salting-out
effect, which enhances the BPA sorption level.

Figure 4 Effects of Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations on
sorption behavior of (a) BPA and (b) TCS (test condition: 100 mg/L
sorbent with 500 μg/L sorbate initial concentration, 4 h adsorption
time) on graphene or activated carbon.

Since the graphene used in this study was reduced greatly
with
long-time thermal treatment and a relatively low concentration (0.1
g/L) was used, the squeezing-out effect may have little effect on
the BPA sorption process. The pH used in the experiments for studying
the ion effect was controlled at 7.0, at which BPA mostly exists in
its neutral form. Therefore, ionic strength would have limited effects
on the BPA sorption as the electrostatic interaction possessed very
low percentage in the sorption mechanisms. On the other hand, the
increase of ionic strength can promote the hydrophobic interaction,
which may induce the increase of BPA sorption on graphene. Finally,
the salting-out effect should play a dominant role in the enhancement
of BPA sorption level because of the poor solubility of BPA in water.
The increase of ion concentration can facilitate the attachment of
BPA molecules on the surface of graphene as a high ionic concentration
will reduce the solubility of BPA. A similar result was also reported
by Xu et al.,2 showing a substantial increase
of the BPA sorption level on graphene when NaCl concentration was
increased from 0 to 0.1 M. The other phenomenon warranting attention
is the stronger effects of CaCl2 than NaCl on the BPA sorption
on graphene. One reason may be attributed to the higher ionic strength
of CaCl2 than NaCl at the same mole, which may greatly
enhance the hydrophobic interaction and salting-out effect. The other
reason may be the adsorption of Ca2+ on the negatively
charged functional groups on the graphene surface, which then transforms
the surface charge to be positive. The positive-charged surface may
increase the sorption of BPA anions (small amount at pH 7) by the
electrostatic attraction. For the activated carbon, sorption levels
of BPA were also elevated with the increase of NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations. Similar to the two mechanisms on graphene (electrostatic
screening effect and salting-out effect), the dominant effect for
the increase of BPA sorption on activated carbon will be the salting-out
effect of BPA because of the limited effect of electrostatic interaction.

Figure 4b showed
that the increase of NaCl and CaCl2 concentrations had
no significant effect on TCS sorption on graphene or activated carbon.
From the view of mechanisms, the ions may affect the sorption process
by the squeezing-out effect (for graphene only), electrostatic screening
effect, and salting-out effect. However, as the log Kow of TCS (4.76) is much higher than that of BPA (3.32),
the hydrophobic interaction between TCS and graphene (or activated
carbon) is much stronger than BPA. The sorption of TCS on graphene
or activated carbon was generally controlled by the hydrophobic and
π–π interactions. Thus, the ions may have limited
effects on sorption because of the strong hydrophobic and π–π
interactions and weak electrostatic interaction. Similar results were
also reported by Behera et al.,6 showing
that NaCl concentration (0.001–0.1 M) had no effect on the
TCS sorption level on activated carbon.

Conclusions
The
sorption behavior of BPA and TCS on graphene was studied in
comparison with that on activated carbon under different conditions.
The sorption kinetics demonstrated that the sorption of BPA and TCS
on graphene or activated carbon reached equilibrium within several
hours. The kinetic data were fitted better with the pseudo-second-order
model for graphene, while fitting well with both the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order models for activated carbon. The sorption
isotherm showed that the maximum sorption capacities (qm) of BPA on graphene or activated carbon were almost
the same. However, the linear sorption behavior indicated that TCS
could be subjected to stronger sorption on graphene than on activated
carbon. In addition, the sorption level was not affected by pH changes
in the range of 4.0–7.0 but was substantially decreased when
pH ranged from 7.0 to 9.0. A repulsive electrostatic interaction established
between BPA (or TCS) anions and negatively charged surface of graphene
(or activated carbon) at pH above 7.0 would be the main reason for
the decrease of the sorption amount. Finally, the increase of ion
(NaCl and CaCl2) concentrations led to a solid increase
of BPA sorption on graphene or activated carbon because of the salting-out
effect. However, the ions did not affect the sorption of TCS on the
two sorbents because of the strong hydrophobic and π–π
interactions which are generally not influenced by ion concentrations.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Reference standards of BPA and TCS were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). The physical properties of
BPA and TCS are summarized in Table 3. Sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and ammonium acetate
(NH4Ac) were purchased from BDH Ltd. (Poole, Dorset, UK).
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-grade acetonitrile
(ACN) and methanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). Activated carbon and formic acid (FA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. (St. Louis, MO). The Hummer’s method was used to synthesize
graphene oxide (GO) from graphite powder.20,36 The dried GO was first added into a quartz boat and put into a tubular
furnace. An N2 flow (50 mL/min) was then introduced to
remove air for 2 h. The temperature was increased to 250 °C within
90 min and was maintained for 30 min to transform GO to graphene.

Table 3 Physicochemical Properties of BPA
and TCS
Characterization of Sorbents
The average particle size
(d50) of graphene was around 1377.5 ±
140.8 nm, which was measured by a particle size analyzer (Coulter
Multisizer II, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The surface area of
graphene was measured to be 212.56 m2/g by using a surface
area analyzer (Coulter SA 3100, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The
zeta-potential of graphene at pH = 7.0 ± 0.2 was around −19.98
eV by a zeta-potential analyzer (Coulter DELSA 440SX, Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA). The X-ray diffraction pattern of graphene was recorded
by an X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker, Germany) (Figure S1). The morphology of graphene was examined
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800 FEG SEM, Tokyo,
Japan) (Figure S2) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (Philips Tecnai G220 S-TWIN, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
(Figure S3).

Sorption Experiments
All sorption experiments were
conducted in 10 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes containing 1 mg
of graphene (or activated carbon) and 10 mL of solution with varying
BPA or TCS concentrations. The tubes were shaken at 150 rpm and kept
at 25 °C for appropriate time. BPA and TCS were dissolved in
methanol as stock solutions (500 mg/L) because of their low solubility
in water. In the batch tests, the stock solutions were diluted with
water to reach the designed concentrations. In the kinetic experiments,
the initial concentrations of BPA and TCS were controlled at 500 μg/L
(pH = 6.8 ± 0.2), and the concentrations of BPA and TCS in liquid
phase were determined at different time intervals from 5 to 480 min.
The sorption isotherm experiments were conducted with BPA or TCS concentration
from 25 to 1000 μg/L (pH = 6.7 ± 0.3). The initial concentrations
of BPA and TCS during the studies of pH and ionic effects were set
at 500 μg/L. The pH values were adjusted by 0.1 M HCl and 0.1
M NaOH solutions to the desired value, ranging from 5.0 to 9.0. Experimental
ionic concentrations (0.001–0.1 M) were controlled by adding
1 M stock solutions of NaCl(aq) and CaCl2(aq). After sorption, each sample was centrifuged before the suspension
was filtrated through a 0.2 μm membrane filter (Maidstone, UK).
All of the experiments were conducted in three replicates, and the
average values are reported here.

BPA and TCS Determination
BPA and TCS concentrations
were determined by Waters Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography
(UPLC) equipped with a 50 × 2.1 mm Waters BEH C18 column (1.7
μm particle size) and tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers (Milford,
MA). The mobile phases for BPA determination consisted of water (A)
and ACN with 1 mM NH4Ac (B). The mobile phase flow rate
was 0.4 mL/min, and the following gradient was used: 80% B ramped
to 100% B in 1.5 min, kept for 2 min retention, followed by a change
back to 80% B in 2 min. For TCS, the mobile phases consisting of 0.01%
FA in methanol/water (95/5) (A) and 0.01% FA in water/methanol (95/5)
(B) were employed. At a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, the mobile-phase
gradient was ramped from 5 to 95% (A) in 6.2 min, then to 100% (A)
in 0.8 min, and finally ramped down to initial conditions in 8 min.
Both desolvation and cone gas were nitrogen gas and set at 600 and
50 L/h, respectively. The desolvation and source temperatures were
set at 400 and 120 °C, respectively. Argon was selected as the
collision gas, and the pressure in the collision room was controlled
at 3.0 × 10–3 mbar. The capillary voltage used
was 0.5 kV, whereas the dwell time was set to 0.1 s. Multiple-reaction-monitoring
modes were used, and the data collection was monitored by MassLynx
4.1 software. The mass parameters used for BPA and TCS quantifications
were summarized in Table 4.
