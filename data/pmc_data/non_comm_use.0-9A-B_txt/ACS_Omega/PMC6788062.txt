The
healthy benefits of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seed have often been attributed to its oils and proteins. Recent
studies reveal that hemp seed phenylpropionamides could also show
various bioactivities. Continuation of our study on hemp seed provided
a phenylpropionamide, coumaroylaminobutanol glucopyranoside (CLG).
This work investigated the neuroprotective effect of CLG and its underlying
mechanism using lipopolysaccharide-induced BV2 microglia. Our study
demonstrated that CLG increased adenosine monophosphate-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) expression, suppressed the nuclear factor-kappa
B (NF-κB) signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation
of IκBα and NF-κB p65 and decreased proinflammatory
cytokine levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore,
CLG reduced the production of cellular reactive oxygen species and
stimulated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)
signaling pathway. Collectively, these results suggested that CLG
effectively and simultaneously inhibited inflammatory responses and
oxidative stress through the NF-κB and Nrf-2 signaling pathways.
AMPK was also involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of CLG. This
study provides new insights into the diverse bioactive constituents
of hemp seed.

1 Introduction
As the major resident
neuroimmune cells, microglia cells have a
pivotal role in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.1 In response to external pathogenic infections
or cell debris, microglia cells are activated quickly and release
neurotrophic factors, performing their host-defense function. However,
persistent microglia activation will produce excessive amounts of
various proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO), which contribute to neurodegenerative
processes and result in neuronal injury.2 Therefore, pharmaceuticals that can provide inhibitory effects on
microglia overactivation are considered as an effective strategy to
control neurodegenerative progression.

Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) seed has
been used as food and traditional medicine for centuries.3 Hemp seed extracts, containing lignanamides and
other phenylpropionamides, showed potential anti-inflammatory4,5 and antioxidative6 capacity and improved
impaired learning and memory induced by chemical drugs in mice.7,8 Our previous study isolated coumaroylaminobutanol glucopyranoside
(CLG, Figure 1a) from
the hemp seed, a phenylpropionamide compound, which showed significant
activity in the antineuroinflammatory screening test using a lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced BV2 microglia model.4 In
the current work, we aimed to understand how CLG could inhibit LPS-stimulated
neuroinflammation in BV2 microglia.

Figure 1 Effect of CLG on the cell viability of
BV2 microglia with or without
LPS stimulation. (a) Structure of CLG. (b) BV2 cells were cotreated
with various concentrations of CLG (5, 10, 15 μM) or RES (10
μM) with or without LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h. Cell viability
was determined by the MTT assay. (The data are expressed as the mean
± SD of three experiments.)

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a well-known transmembrane receptor,
is able to specifically recognize LPS in microglia signaling.9 Upon stimulation, activated TLR4 recruits the
downstream adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
(MyD88) to activate the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway,
which regulates the expression of various proinflammatory mediators.10 Furthermore, it is now widely accepted that
LPS-induced inflammation can elevate cellular ROS levels in microglia,
and high levels of ROS may in return contribute to the release of
various NF-κB-mediated proinflammatory mediators.11 As an important defense system, nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), one of the major redox-sensitive
transcription factors, can be activated by oxidative stress, leading
to the expression of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other antioxidant
enzymes. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, also plays an evident
role in regulating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in LPS-treated
microglia.12 AMPK activation could inhibit
the inflammatory responses induced by the NF-κB system13 and could prevent neuronal oxidative stress.
There is cross talk between the AMPK and Nrf2/ARE pathways.12

Here, we evaluated the neuroprotective
effect of CLG and investigated
the underlying molecular mechanisms involving TLR4/NF-κB and
Nrf-2/HO-1 pathways and the possible role of AMPK in BV2 microglia.

2 Results and Discussion
Activated microglia can respond
quickly to various stimuli, and
LPS is one of the most frequently used stimuli in different inflammatory
models in vitro and in vivo.14,15 Therefore, we used
LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia as an in vitro inflammatory model.

2.1 Effect of CLG on the Viability of BV2 Microglia
The
cytotoxic effect of CLG was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Compared with the vehicle control, treatment
with various concentrations of CLG (5, 10, 15 μM) or RES (resveratrol,
10 μM) had no significant effect on cell survival (Figure 1b). Moreover, LPS
(100 ng/mL) combined with CLG or RES did not affect the viability
of BV2 cells. Thus, 5, 10, and 15 μM were selected for CLG as
the treatment concentrations for further analysis, RES (10 μM)
was used as a positive control, and LPS (100 ng/mL) was used as a
stimulus in this study.

2.2 Effect of CLG on Proinflammatory
Cytokine
Production in LPS-Induced BV2 Microglia
Proinflammatory cytokines
are involved in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and multiple
neurodegenerative diseases.2 To evaluate
the effects of CLG on proinflammatory cytokine production, IL-1β
and IL-6 levels were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Figure 2a,b shows that LPS stimulation increased the secretion of proinflammatory
cytokines significantly, whereas CLG prevented this effect and significantly
decreased IL-1β and IL-6 levels in a dose-dependent manner compared
with the LPS group. To further evaluate CLG’s effect on mRNA
levels of IL-1β and IL-6, a reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiment was performed. Pretreatment with
CLG reduced IL-1β (Figure 2c) and IL-6 (Figure 2d) mRNA expression significantly in a concentration-dependent
manner compared to the LPS group.

Figure 2 CLG reduced proinflammatory cytokine production
in LPS-stimulated
BV2 microglia. BV2 cells were pretreated with 5, 10, and 15 μM
CLG for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL). After coincubation
for 24 h, the supernatants were collected for the measurement of IL-1β
(a) and IL-6 (b) by ELISA. After coincubation for 6 h, total RNA was
isolated, and relative IL-1β (c) and IL-6 (d) mRNA expression
was measured by RT-PCR. (Data are presented as the mean ± SD
from at least three independent experiments. *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p <
0.001 compared with the LPS-treated group; ###p < 0.001 compared with the control group.)

2.3 Effect of CLG on TLR4/NF-κB Expression
in LPS-Induced BV2 Microglia
TLR4 is a starting point in
the entire LPS-initiated signaling pathway, and LPS is recognized
by TLR4.16 TLR4 undergoes dimerization
and recruits its downstream adaptors including MyD88. The MyD88-dependent
pathway triggers a signaling cascade, leading to NF-κB pathway
activation and then the production of proinflammatory cytokines.17 TLR4/NF-κB signaling is one of the major
pathways mediating immune and inflammatory responses and is closely
involved in the expression of inflammatory mediators.17

The effects of CLG on TLR4/NF-κB signaling
were detected in this study. Western blotting showed that LPS increased
TLR4 expression significantly, compared to the control group, but
CLG treatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced increase of
TLR4 dose-dependently (Figure 3a,b). MyD88 is a downstream adaptor for TLR4 and triggers
a signaling cascade, leading to NF-κB activation, so we further
checked the MyD88-dependent mechanism. Figure 3a,c demonstrates that CLG could suppress
the LPS-induced activation of MyD88, indicating that CLG could interfere
in LPS-induced inflammation through a MyD88-dependent manner.

Figure 3 CLG inhibited
TLR4/NF-κB protein expression in LPS-induced
BV2 microglia. BV2 cells were pretreated with CLG for 1 h and stimulated
with LPS. After stimulation for 24 h, cell extracts were prepared
and subjected to western blotting with TLR4 and MyD88 antibodies.
After stimulation for 1 h, cell extracts were prepared and subjected
to western blotting with IκBα, phospho-IκBα,
NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65 antibodies. β-Actin
was used as the internal control for normalization. (a) Western blot
bands of TLR4 and MyD88. (b) The density of TLR4 bands was measured,
and their ratio was calculated. (c) Density ratio of MyD88 bands.
(d) Western blot bands of IκBα, phospho-IκBα,
NF-κB p65, and phospho-NF-κB p65. (e–h) Density
ratio of phospho-NF-κB p65, p65, phospho-IκBα, and
IκBα. (The results are presented as the mean ± SD
from at least three independent experiments. *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p <
0.001 compared with cells treated with LPS; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, and ###p < 0.001 compared with the control.)

The NF-κB pathway plays a crucial role in the activation
of inflammatory responses and the regulation of inflammatory cytokine
production.18 Phosphorylation and degradation
of IκB are primarily involved in NF-κB activation triggered
by LPS, and we explored the effect of CLG on the activation of NF-κB
p65 and IκBα. Results (Figure 3d) revealed that LPS treatment increased
the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκBα but decreased
the expression of IκBα and NF-κB p65 compared with
the vehicle control. However, CLG dose-dependently reduced NF-κB
p65 and IκB phosphorylation levels and promoted NF-κB
65 and IκB expression compared with the LPS treatment group
(Figure 3d–h),
indicating that CLG could prevent LPS-induced inflammation through
inhibiting the activation of the NF-κB pathway.

Taken
together, these results supported that the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
pathway was involved in the effect of CLG on protecting BV2 cells
against LPS-induced neuroinflammation.

2.4 Effect
of CLG on Cellular ROS Production and
Nrf-2/HO-1 Expression in LPS-Induced BV2 Microglia
LPS treatment
dramatically increases not only proinflammatory cytokine production
but also ROS levels in microglia.19 ROS
is a hallmark of inflammatory responses and oxidative damage in microglia.20 Here, we investigated the antioxidant effect
of CLG on ROS generation in LPS-induced BV2 cells by dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA). As expected, CLG treatment dose-dependently quenched
ROS production compared with the LPS-treated group (Figure 4a,b), suggesting that CLG alleviated
oxidative damage by decreasing the production of ROS in LPS-activated
microglia.

Figure 4 CLG reduced cellular ROS generation and promoted Nrf-2/HO-1 expression
in LPS-induced BV2 microglia. BV2 cells were treated with CLG for
1 h prior to LPS stimulation for 24 h. (a) Cellular ROS
levels were measured using DCFH-DA by flow cytometry. (b) Quantification
of the relative % of cells with ROS production. (c) Cell lysates were
collected and analyzed using western blotting for Nrf-2 and HO-1.
(d,e) The density of Nrf-2 and HO-1 bands was measured, and their
ratio was calculated. β-Actin was used as the internal control
for normalization. (The results are presented as the mean ± SD
from at least three independent experiments. **p <
0.01 compared with cells treated with LPS; ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 compared
with the control.)

As an important cellular
defense mechanism, Nrf-2-mediated signaling
has been shown to be vital in modulating redox homeostasis and attenuating
oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.21 Nrf-2 can be rapidly upregulated by various oxidative stress
stimuli, including LPS and ROS, and can then regulate inflammatory
and antioxidant responses. As one of the downstream antioxidant genes
of Nrf-2, HO-1 has been recently demonstrated to exhibit important
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions.22 Therefore, the regulation of the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway can
benefit the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. This pathway
can be activated not only by various cellular stresses but also by
chemical inducers from exogenous sources. Many small molecule Nrf-2
inducers from natural sources have been reported.23

To better understand the antioxidant molecular pathway
of CLG,
we further explored whether the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling is affected by
CLG using western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 4c–e, Nrf2/HO-1 was slightly activated
in the LPS stimulated group, possibly attributed to the oxidative
stress induced by LPS. Pretreatment with CLG significantly upregulated
Nrf-2 (Figure 4c,d)
and HO-1 (Figure 4c,e)
protein expression dose-dependently, suggesting that CLG was a Nrf-2
inducer, and the activation of Nrf-2/HO-1 could contribute to the
antioxidative effect of CLG.

These results show that CLG could
inhibit neuroinflammation partly
via antioxidant mechanisms by decreasing ROS production directly and
activating Nrf-2/HO-1 in LPS-induced BV2 microglia.

2.5 Effect of CLG on AMPK Activation in LPS-Induced
BV2 Microglia
AMPK has attracted increasing attention not
only for its crucial regulation of energy metabolism homeostasis but
also for the correlation between antioxidant and anti-inflammation
in neurodegenerative diseases.24 Emerging
evidence shows that AMPK activation contributes to the antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory mechanisms by enhancing Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling
and inhibiting NF-κB signaling.12,13 Previous studies
have revealed that AMPK participates in regulating the release of
IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and ROS generation.25,26 Considering the critical role of AMPK in inflammatory responses
and oxidative stress, we detected AMPK activation in LPS-induced BV2
microglia by western blotting. As expected, compared with the LPS
group, CLG reversed the effect of LPS on the expression of phosphorylated
AMPK dose-dependently (Figure 5a,b). To check if the impact on AMPK is related to CLG’s
anti-inflammatory effect, further investigation of AMPK was carried
out by adding an inhibitor, dorsomorphin (compound C, C–C),
and the expression of IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA was measured using
RT-PCR. The inhibitor counteracted the CLG effect on the mRNA levels
of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6) (Figure 5c,d) in LPS-induced BV2 microglia,
indicating that the inhibitory effects of CLG on LPS-induced neuroinflammatory
responses were closely linked with AMPK activation. On the basis of
the reported AMPK/NF-κB pathway,12,13 we propose
that the CLG effect on the NF-κB pathway is related to AMPK,
but further work still needs to be designed to reveal the effect of
CLG on signals between the AMPK and NF-κB pathways. The NF-κB
subunits are not direct phosphorylation targets of AMPK, but several
downstream targets of AMPK, such as SIRT1 (silent information regulator),
p53, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator
1α (PGC-1α), and Forkhead box O (FoxO) factors, could
mediate the inhibition of NF-κB signaling.13 The effects of CLG on these downstream targets of AMPK
should be explored in future to understand the effect of CLG on the
cross talk between the AMPK and NF-κB pathways. Besides, the
inhibitor of AMPK only partially restored the IL-1β and IL-6
mRNA expression; other factors not involved in our study such as PI3K/AKT,
MAPK, ERK, and JNK may also be involved in LPS-induced proinflammatory
cytokine expression.27,28 More mechanism study needs to
be implemented to better understand the effect of CLG in LPS-stimulated
microglia.

Figure 5 CLG increased AMPK activation in LPS-induced BV2 microglia. BV2
cells were treated with CLG for 1 h prior to LPS stimulation for 24
h. Cell lysates were collected and analyzed using western blotting
for phospho-AMPK and AMPK (a). The density of phospho-AMPK and AMPK
bands was measured, and their ratio was calculated (b). Cells were
pretreated with or without CLG and C–C (1 μM) for 1 h
and then coincubated with LPS for 6 h, total RNA was isolated, and
relative IL-1β (c) and IL-6 (d) mRNA expression was measured
by RT-PCR. β-Actin was used as the internal control. (The results
are presented as the mean ± SD from at least three independent
experiments. *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 compared with cells treated with LPS; ###p < 0.001 compared with the control.)

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, this study
demonstrated for the first time that
CLG could inhibit LPS-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress
in BV2 microglia through the TLR4/NF-κB and Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling
pathways. Moreover, AMPK also played an important role in the anti-inflammatory
effect of CLG. However, this work only demonstrated that CLG treatment
had a close connection with AMPK, TLR4/NF-κB, and Nrf-2/HO-1
signaling pathways. To determine the direct target of CLG in microglia,
more studies are still needed. Our findings contribute to the knowledge
of diverse bioactive compounds from hemp seed and the potential of
hemp seed in the treatment of microglia-related neuroinflammatory
diseases.

4.2 Extraction of CLG
CLG was isolated
from hemp seed as previously described,4 and the chemical structure of CLG is illustrated in Figure 1a. The air-dried seeds (10.7
kg) were crushed and defatted with petroleum ether (2 times, 30 L
for 60 h) and then extracted with 95% EtOH under reflux (3 times,
50 L for 2 h), and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to 500
mL. The EtOH extract (1 kg) was subsequently separated by an AB-8
macroporous adsorption resin column (elution with EtOH/H2O), a Sephadex LH-20 column (elution with MeOH, 1.05 g), a medium-pressure
reversed-phase column liquid chromatograph (elution with MeOH/H2O, 690 mg), and a high-speed countercurrent chromatograph
(elution with EtOAc/MeOH/H2O). Successively, CLG (28.80
mg) was obtained, and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis
provided a purity of more than 98%.

4.3 Cell
Culture and Drug Treatment
A
murine microglia cell line (BV2) was purchased from the Cell Bank
of the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). BV2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

Prior
to the experiments, cells were transferred to 96-well (8 × 103 cells/well), 12-well (3 × 104 cells/well),
or 6-well (1 × 106 cells/well) plates and incubated
overnight. In all experiments, BV2 cells were pretreated with either
DMSO (vehicle control) or CLG (5, 10, 15 μM) for 1 h before
the addition of LPS (100 ng/mL). RES (10 μM) was used as a positive
control. CLG was dissolved in DMSO, stored at −20 °C,
and diluted with the culture medium to obtain the desired final concentration
before use. The final concentration of DMSO was always less than 0.4%.
LPS was dissolved in sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
stored at −20 °C and then diluted with the culture medium.

4.4 Measurement of Cell Viability
Cell
viability was assessed by MTT. BV2 cells were plated into 96-well
culture plates and incubated overnight and then incubated with various
concentrations of CLG or RES for 1 h prior to treatment with LPS for
another 24 h. The culture medium was removed, and 10 μL of MTT
was added (0.5 mg/mL) and incubated for 4 h. The formazan crystals
were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO. Absorbance was read at 540
nm. The results are expressed as a percentage of control cells.

4.5 Measurement of Cytokines by ELISA
Proinflammatory
cytokine production was assayed using ELISA kits
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BV2 cells were
treated with CLG in the absence or presence of LPS for 24 h. Culture
supernatants were collected and centrifuged, and the levels of IL-1β
and IL-6 were assessed. The optical density of each well was measured
at 450 nm.

4.6 Measurement of Intracellular
ROS
DCFH-DA, a stable nonpolar compound that diffuses readily
into cells
and yields DCFH, was used to detect cellular ROS generation. After
drug treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated
with serum-free medium containing 10 μg/mL of DCFH-DA at 37
°C for 30 min in the dark. Thereafter, cells were washed with
PBS and then harvested and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence intensity
of DCF fluorescence as the oxidized product of DCFH was analyzed with
a 488 nm excitation filter and a 525 nm emission wavelength by flow
cytometry (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

4.7 RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNA
was extracted using the TRIzol reagent, and RNA concentration was
evaluated at 260 and 280 nm. RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed
into cDNA using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit. RT-PCR was carried
out with cDNA and SYBR Premix Ex Taq. The RT-PCR conditions were 95
°C for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 53 °C for
15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. The relative mRNA expression was normalized
to β-actin expression and calculated by the 2–ΔΔCT. The primer sequences are as follows: IL-1β (forward: 5′-CAT
ATG AGC TGA AAG CTC TCC A-3′, reverse: 5′-GAC ACA GAT
TCC ATG GTG AAG TC-3′); IL-6 (forward: 5′-CCA CTT CAC
AAG TCG GAG GC-3′, reverse: 5′-CCA GCT TAT CTG TTA GGA
GA-3′); and β-actin (forward: 5′-GTG ACG TTG ACA
TCC GTA AAG A-3′, reverse: 5′-GCC GGA CTC ATC GTA CTC
C-3′).

4.8 Western Blot Analysis
After drug
treatment, BV2 cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer on ice
for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 14 000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples (40 μg) were loaded and separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and then blocked with 5% nonfat
milk at room temperature for 4 h, followed by incubation with primary
antibody in TBST at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with
TBST (3 times, 10 min), the blots were incubated with the HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with
TBST (3 times, 10 min), the membranes were visualized using ECL reagents,
and images were scanned and quantified using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA). Each band was normalized to the loading
control β-actin.

4.9 Statistical Analysis
Experiments
were carried out at least in triplicate, and the results were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism software version 7 (Graph Pad software Inc.,
CA, USA) and expressed as the mean ± SD. One-way analysis of
variance followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons
was used to analyze the statistical significance. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
