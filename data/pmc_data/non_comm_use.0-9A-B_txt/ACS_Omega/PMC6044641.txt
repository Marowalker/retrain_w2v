Facing
the widespread use of cosmetic products in daily use and
recognizing the very limited information obtained by target analysis,
a method suited for comprehensive characterization of cosmetics was
aimed at. The biological activity of ingredients of 20 cosmetics taken
from 16 different product groups and their coumarin contents were
investigated via chromatography linked to bioassays (direct bioautography)
and mass spectrometry. It allows for screening a large number of cosmetic
products within a short time to generate a more valid database on
their coumarin content and their contribution to the overall exposure.
Bioactivity profiling of cosmetics with regard to bioactive ingredients
opens new avenues for a comprehensive characterization of important
substances in products of daily use, helpful for the legally required
safety and risk assessment of cosmetic products, especially for multiple
product usage. As for coumarin, a ubiquitary fragrance compound of
allergenic potential, which is under
recurrent discussion due to its hepatoxic properties, it is necessary
to be able to estimate the regular intake via cosmetics for a valid
risk assessment. This newly developed bioprofiling method allowed
a selective determination of coumarin down to 1.3 mg kg–1, even for very matrix-rich cosmetics despite minimalism in sample
preparation. The declaration limits according to European Cosmetics
Regulation were completely covered. Mean coumarin contents of 20 cosmetic
products reached up to 2218 mg kg–1. The repeatabilities
(%RSD, n = 3) were between 1.1 and 2.9%, and the
mean recoveries (n = 5) were between 96 and 102%
for the different cosmetic matrices.

1 Introduction
Considering
multiple product usage over a day, the overall impact
of biologically active ingredients of cosmetics through the skin is
a rough estimate. A screening method that more precisely informs on
potential effects at a given rational effort is not existent and triggered
this research. On the example of coumarin, the present challenge is
illustrated in detail. Coumarin belongs to a chemical class of benzopyrones,
which includes further naturally occurring derivatives, such as, umbelliferone
(7-hydroxycoumarin), aesculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin), or
herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin), showing a wide variety of biological
activities. As a main aroma compound of cinnamon (especially Cinnamomum cassia), coumarin is a natural ingredient
of many food products. The odor-fixing properties and sweet, warm,
vanilla-like scent of coumarin explain its use as a synthetic fragrance
component or as a natural ingredient of various essential oils and
plant extracts, such as sweet woodruff, tonka, or lavender, in a large
number of cosmetic products.1,2

In the past, coumarin
was repeatedly under discussion due to its
potential toxicological properties. Species-specific animal testing
data (e.g., of rats and dogs) indicated a possible hepatotoxicity
after oral intake,3 whereupon the use of
coumarin in its synthetic form was banned in the USA and numerous
European countries since the mid-20th century.4,5 New
scientific in vivo data6,7 let the Scientific Panel on Food
Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with
Food of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) allay the suspicion
that coumarin may be genotoxic and may bind covalently to the DNA,
which supports the induction of tumors.8 It is generally accepted that there are major interspecies differences
regarding coumarin metabolism, which may be responsible for the diverse
hepatoxicity data observed.9−12 However, clinical data from therapeutic use of coumarin
show that hepatotoxicity in man cannot completely be ruled out for
sensitive individuals.13 Thus, it has to
be supposed that a small group of humans may be susceptible to coumarin.
Hence, the authority confirmed a hepatotoxic potential of coumarin.
According to animal testing data, a no-observed-adverse-effect level
for liver toxicity of 10 mg coumarin kg–1 bw day–1 was determined for the most sensitive animal species
(dog). Derived from this value and taking into account a safety factor
of 100, the EFSA established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1
mg coumarin kg–1 bw day–1.8 To guarantee the safety of the consumers, the
European Flavoring Regulation (EU) No. 1334/2008 laid down limit values
between 5 and 50 mg kg–1 for coumarin in cinnamon-containing
food, oriented to the TDI and the average daily intake of coumarin
assuming a normal diet. These limits were also set under the proviso
that coumarin is not added in its isolated or synthetic form but added
as a natural part of a food ingredient like cinnamon powder.14

Scientific data show that coumarin penetrates
easily and to a high
proportion through the skin, i.e., up to 60 or even 100%, depending
on the used vehicle,9,15,16 and is therefore also systemically available. Inexplicably, in contrast
to food, there is no maximum limit set by the European Cosmetics Regulation
(EU) No 1223/2009 for the usage of coumarin in cosmetics.17 Merely, due to the known sensitization potential
of coumarin,18−20 the Cosmetics Regulation requires the declaration
of coumarin in the ingredient list of cosmetics from a level of 0.01%
(rinse-off products) and 0.001% (leave-on products). Additionally,
the International Fragrance Association and the Research Institute
for Fragrance Materials recommend specific limits for the usage of
coumarin in different end products for the manufacturers in the perfume
and cosmetic industry.21 These limits between
0.1% for lip products and 5% for rinse-off hair conditioners are based
on a quantitative risk assessment, currently solely set to reduce
the risk of sensitization against coumarin in the general population
to a minimum.

Human exposure to coumarin via diet has been estimated
to be around
0.02 mg kg–1 day–1.10 The exposure through the use of cosmetics is
assumed to be about twice as high.10 Also,
the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) calculated
the dermal exposure to coumarin22 oriented
at the average coumarin concentrations of different cosmetic products
and the estimated daily exposure levels for different cosmetic product
types, as published by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety
(SCCS).23 Considering a correction factor
for skin absorption, which was based on experimental data15 and assuming maximum intake levels (worst-case
scenario), the BfR calculated an exposure level of 0.14 mg kg–1 bw day–1 for perfumes and 0.013
mg kg–1 bw day–1 for body lotions
or oils. As an average consumer normally uses multiple cosmetic products
over the day, the overall coumarin concentration is expected to be
even higher. Accordingly, for persons who use cosmetics regularly,
the TDI can be significantly exceeded or at least partially reached.
Therefore, the intake of coumarin via the dermal route should not
be underestimated, especially as the metabolism of coumarin after
oral administration or dermal application seems to be similar (no
specific metabolism in the skin).9,10 However, the
BfR pointed out that conclusive data about the coumarin concentration
of different cosmetic products in the market are still low and further
research is needed to make a final assessment.

To determine
the concentration of coumarin in cosmetic products
and to control the specified declaration requirements, both manufacturers
and authorities need fast and reliable analytical methods. For the
determination of coumarin in food and some plant extracts, different
analytical methods are described. In early times, paper chromatography,
thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and polarography were mainly used.24 Today, mostly high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) are the methods of choice.25−29 Many of these methods are selective and sensitive; however, they
require relatively expensive instrumentation or a rather laborious
sample preparation. A currently developed high-performance thin-layer
chromatography (HPTLC) method for the determination of coumarin in
different food products used postchromatographic derivatization with
a methanolic potassium solution.30 Immersing
the HPTLC plate in the alkaline solution led to an opening of the
lactone ring of coumarin31 and resulted
in an intensive fluorescence (excitation wavelength at 360 nm), which
allowed a sensitive determination and quantification of coumarin in
the food samples.

The present work was aimed at adapting the
latter sensitive method
to the examination of cosmetics, even those with a heavy matrix load.
Hyphenation with various bioassay detection systems could allow a
first insight regarding the bioactivity of different commonly used
cosmetic ingredients. Direct bioautography has already been proven
to be an effective tool for the identification of bioactive components
in plant extracts, food, or waste water32−35 and may be just as useful for
a first bioprofiling of cosmetic products. The targeted coupling with
mass spectrometry (MS) may allow the characterization of active cosmetic
ingredients of interest. Such a streamlined method will improve the
knowledge on the extent of cosmetic usage, contributing to the total
exposure of coumarin and further biologically active compounds.

2 Results and Discussion
Facing the widespread use of
cosmetic products in daily use while
recognizing the very limited information obtained by target analysis,
a method suited for comprehensive characterization of cosmetics was
aimed at. The method focused on simplicity, rapidity, and high throughput
screening of very different cosmetic products with different textures
to increase the data set regarding the coumarin usage and biological
effects of further ingredients.

2.1 Minimalism in Sample Preparation
After experiences with the preparation of food,30 ethanol seemed to be an effective solvent for cosmetic
samples of a wide polarity range. However, for semisolid and especially
solid formulations (e.g., lip care sticks), dispersibility of the
samples was a limiting factor. Thus, a scent-free hand cream was spiked
with a known amount of coumarin and extracted using ethyl acetate,
acetonitrile, ethanol (60 °C), and oxolane. Oxolane was preferred,
as it showed an almost complete recovery of more than 98% for the
hand cream (Figure S-1), while a sufficient
dispersion or in most cases even a complete dissolution was reached.
Compared with the other solvents, oxolane showed the best performance
regarding both sample preparation and recovery for a wide range of
product groups, such as alcohol-based deodorants, oil-in-water (o/w)
emulsions, and (semi)solid products, such as lip care sticks or body
butter. Because cosmetic products are mixtures of various substances
and often include oils, waxes, or other fatty components, their incomplete
solubility may be challenging for using a closed analytical system
like HPLC with regard to clogging or contamination of the column.
In the case of HPTLC, which is an open system that uses each separation
phase only once, possible matrix contaminations are no issue. This
allowed a minimum of sample preparation for all samples studied that
was reduced to dissolution and, if required, membrane filtration.

2.2 Stability of Coumarin in Solution
The coumarin
solution was stored at 6 °C in the dark. Ten aliquots,
taken during 21 days, were analyzed for their coumarin content. Comparable
concentrations of coumarin were obtained over the 3 week period (Figure S-2) with relative standard deviations
(%RSD, n = 10) of 3.3 or 2.1%, depending on the respective
application volume (0.5 or 2 μL of the 10 ng/μL solution).
Thus, the stability of coumarin solutions for up to 3 weeks was proven.

2.3 Fluorescence Stability on the Plate
Postchromatographic
derivatization with potassium hydroxide was chosen
to visualize coumarin on the HPTLC plate. As the resulting fluorescence
was light-sensitive, it was necessary to stabilize the fluorescent
signal of the derivatized coumarin in the chromatogram. Both 30% paraffin
in n-hexane and 10% methanolic poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) solution were tested. However, PEG was advantageous regarding
fluorescence stabilization and intensification (data not shown). The
influence of light on the PEG-treated fluorescence was examined in
detail over a period of 1 h. Storage under daylight led to a strong
decrease of the fluorescence of about 50% within 15 min, whereas for
storage in the dark, a small reduction in the fluorescence signal
was observable in the first 10 min, while the fluorescence was relatively
stable over the next 30 min (Figure S-3). Consequently, the freshly derivatized chromatogram was instantly
transferred to the TLC Scanner 4 and kept in the dark. After a waiting
time of 10 min, the measurement
was performed in the fluorescence-stable period.

Immersion into
the PEG solution did not only stabilize the fluorescent signal but
also enhanced it, at least by a factor of 3 (Figure S-3). A standardized procedure for the derivatization was established,
which included defined drying times before and in between the immersions.
Sufficient drying was crucial to prevent spreading of the coumarin
zone during immersion. In contrast, the immersion time and immersion
speed had only minimal influence on the shape and sharpness of the
coumarin zone. Drying of the plate was performed on a plate heater
and not under a stream of warm air because the latter resulted in
a reduced fluorescence signal, peak broadening, and worsened precision
(data not shown).

2.4 Method Validation
For the newly developed
method, selectivity, recovery, repeatability, reproducibility, limit
of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were examined.
As the derivatization was highly selective and sensitive, coumarin
could be determined at very small amounts, even in very matrix-rich
cosmetics without interference by other UV-absorbing components or
impurities (Figure S-4). For recovery,
three different cosmetic formulations (alcohol-based deodorant, o/w
emulsion hand cream, and body oil) were spiked with two different
coumarin amounts (50 and 100 μg per 0.4 g) to represent a content
found in commercially available cosmetic products. With oxolane as
the extraction solvent, mean recovery rates between 96 and 102% (n = 5) were determined for the three samples, confirming
the applicability of the method for quite different cosmetic textures.

For repeatability of the coumarin result on the same plate (%RSD, n = 3, peak area) by threefold analysis of four different
product samples (deodorant, body milk, body oil, and lip care stick),
the standard deviations ranged between 1.1 and 2.9%. Reproducibility
(%RSD, n = 2) was between 0.7 and 3.7%, determined
on different days on different HPTLC plates for seven cosmetic samples
with various textures (deodorant, body butter, cleaning milk, face
cream, body lotion, bath essence, and conditioner). Including sample
preparation, reproducibility (%RSD, n = 2) was between
1.7 and 5.8% (overall analysis) for the 20 cosmetics. These results
confirmed the good precision of the method.

LOQs for the coumarin
determination were 500 pg band–1 and 1.3 mg kg–1 for the samples. LOD was determined
to be 200 pg band–1 for standard solutions (Figure S-5). The European Cosmetics Regulation
prescribes a declaration of coumarin from a concentration of 0.01%
for leave-on and 0.001% for rinse-off products. Thus, with an about
10 times lower LOQ, the developed method is well-suited to prove the
declaration requirements of coumarin in cosmetics.

The developed
method showed a good linearity in the calibration
range of 0.5–40 ng band–1 with a relative
standard deviation of the calibration function of 2.4% and a correlation
coefficient of 0.9998 (Figure S-6). At
higher amounts of coumarin on the plate, the fluorescence signal was
too intense and the applied coumarin volumes started to spread slightly
on the plate during application. This resulted in the formation of
a double peak, noticed during fluorescence measurement. For routine
analysis, a three-point calibration was applied.

2.5 Fast and Accurate Sample Analysis to Support
Risk Assessment
The applicability of the method was proven
for 20 cosmetic products of a wide formulation range, i.e., ethanol-based
deodorants, o/w emulsions with light texture (e.g., body milk), semisolid
cream formulations for hand and face, and body oils and solid products
(lip care stick). Chromatography was performed on HPTLC plates, silica
gel 60, with a mixture of n-hexane, ethyl acetate,
and ammonia (3.8:1.3:0.05, v/v/v) up to a migration distance of 55
mm.30 The addition of that small volume
of ammonia as a modifier resulted in an optimal sharpness of the coumarin
band at hRF 50 ± 2. Despite the minimal
sample preparation, a baseline separation from matrix components was
evident (Figure S-4) and a fast development
time of less than 15 min was reached. Even in the case of the examined
sunscreen sample with a high content of UV filters, which showed partly
a strong fluorescence themselves, the UV filters were clearly separated
from the coumarin band. This allowed a sensitive and selective quantification
of coumarin (Figure 1, tracks 19 and 20).

(twofold
overall analysis) with matrix mainly located at the start zone or
in the front, as well as coumarin standard (S1–S3, 2.5–20
ng band–1).

As to be expected, there were big differences regarding the
coumarin
content, which varied between 1.3 and 2218 mg kg–1 (Table 1). The highest
concentration was measured for a bath additive, for which the need
for a further dilution was evident during application. However, also
the body care products, which are applied in a high amount on a large
skin surface, contained coumarin up to 312 mg kg–1.

According
to the European Cosmetics Regulation, manufacturers of
cosmetic products are required to assess every product prior to its
market launch in terms of its safety for human health. In this context,
toxicological properties of all ingredients and the common exposure
conditions must be taken into account. Because it is known that an
average consumer uses several cosmetics every day, also the amount
of applied coumarin can add up so that the proportion of the total
intake of coumarin via cosmetic usage should not be underestimated.
The cumulative human exposure value for different cosmetic products
is estimated to be 17.4 g day–1.23 Because coumarin shows a high dermal absorption value of
60–100%, the majority of the topically applied fragrance compounds
is systemically available.10

To evaluate
the safety of coumarin, it is useful to resort to the
earlier mentioned TDI value of 0.1 mg kg–1 bw day–1. It is generally agreed that cosmetics should exhaust
the TDI to a maximum of 20%. For example, the amounts of face or hand
cream needed to reach 20% of the TDI are much higher than the daily
exposure levels estimated by the SCCS (Table S-2). However, in the case of the analyzed body lotion, the required
amount of 3.8 g product is clearly below the estimated daily use level
of 7.8 g. For an average adult, the TDI would be exhausted to over
40% by usage of the lotion if the SCCS assessment is considered. In
the case of a child, the TDI would even be exceeded by over 60%. Also,
bath additives seem to have a high relevance in this context due to
the relatively high coumarin content. However, a bath additive gets
normally highly diluted by the bathing water during application, so
an additional retention factor must be considered. Although only a
part of the cosmetics in the market contain coumarin, it can be seen
that a significant portion of the TDI value could possibly be exhausted
alone by the regular application of certain products, especially for
cosmetics applied on the whole body. If it is taken into account that
an average consumer uses various cosmetic products during the day,
the coumarin concentration is likely to increase. Accordingly, it
can be confirmed that cosmetic products can contribute significantly
to the overall exposure to coumarin.

2.6 HPTLC–MS
Confirmation
Postchromatographic
derivatization of coumarin is the first choice for routine screening
of cosmetics due to its high sensitivity and selectivity as well as
its simple and fast performance. However, targeted coupling with MS
could also be used to confirm the results in uncertain cases. As mass
spectra are recorded from the zones of interest only, intervals of
MS cleaning were reduced due to the minimal matrix or background load.
In a cosmetic, the HPTLC–MS full scan mass spectrum of the
assigned coumarin zone showed the basepeak at m/z 147 [M + H]+ and another pronounced signal at m/z 169 [M + Na]+ (Figure 2). Furthermore, two signals at m/z 179 and 201 indicated the addition of two hydroxyl groups. A hydroxylation
of coumarin is conceivable due to the alkaline conditions. Sodium
adducts are also observed, as sodium is ubiquitously present.

Figure 2 HPTLC–MS
of a coumarin zone in a cosmetic sample showing
as basepeak the protonated molecule at m/z 147 [M
+ H]+ and its sodium adduct at m/z 169
[M + Na]+ as well as its respective dihydroxy forms at m/z 179 and m/z 201.

At a migration distance
comparable to the coumarin zone, a plate
background was recorded and subtracted from the analyte spectrum to
reduce signals caused by the mobile phase, plate, or MS system. As
the underivatized coumarin zones are both colorless and nonfluorescent,
the outer track of the plate was cut off and derivatized to determine
the correct migration distance for coumarin on the remaining plate.
Positioning was facilitated on HPTLC plates with a fluorescence indicator
because coumarin showed fluorescence quenching at concentrations ≥100
ng band–1 (Figure 3A). After the recording of mass spectra, the plate
can be derivatized to confirm the proper positioning of the elution
head on the zone of interest, as the oval elution head eluted not
the complete substance zone but only about 60%. Thus, the residual
substance amount was suited for post-MS visualization. The single
quadrupole MS determination showed a substantially poorer sensitivity
with a LOD of 500 ng band–1 for sample and standard
zones, when compared with fluorescence measurement. However, the use
of high-resolution MS (HRMS)30 or MS–MS
will improve the LOD.

Figure 3 HPTLC-effect-directed analysis: chromatograms of different
cosmetics
(nos. 1–17 according to Table 1) and coumarin standard (S, 800 ng band–1) at (A) UV 254 nm, (B) UV 366 nm, and (C) after 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
radical (DPPH•) assay at white light illumination
as well as bioautograms after (D) Aliivibrio fischeri bioassay as grayscale image, (E) pYES bioassay at UV 366 nm (estradiol
150 pg band–1 as positive control C) and (F) Bacillus subtilis bioassay at white light illumination.

2.7 HPTLC–DPPH• Assay
The DPPH• assay provides
a simple way to evaluate
the free-radical scavenging activity of a substance and thus its antioxidant
potential. Compared with the sum parameter assay, which indicates
the overall radical-scavenging activity of a sample, dipping of the
HPTLC plate into the reaction solution allows an assignment to specified
single ingredients. In addition, a first estimation can be made to
what extent individual components contribute to the overall antioxidant
activity of a sample. Cosmetic ingredients with a positive response
were indicated as light white zones on a purple background. For coumarin,
no antioxidant activity was observed even for high coumarin concentrations
of up to 800 ng band–1 (Figure 3C), whereas the coumarin substance band was
clearly seen at UV 254 nm (Figure 3A). However, light substance bands were observed for
nearly all cosmetic samples, indicating the antioxidative potential
of some of the contained ingredients. This is not surprising because
many cosmetics in the market advertise with a specific antioxidant
potential of the product itself or some of its ingredients related
to a possible protection function of those products for the skin.
To gain more information about the ingredients that showed a strong
free-radical scavenging activity during the assay, it is possible
to characterize these substance zones by HPTLC–electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). However, this was not the focus
of this work. To generate more bioprofiling information regarding
a potential activity of coumarin and the cosmetic samples, the chromatograms
were subjected to further bioassays.

2.8 HPTLC–A. fischeri Bioassay
The bioluminescence
of the Gram-negative A. fischeri bacteria
can be influenced by bioactive
compounds. Depending on the respective effect of a compound (positive
or negative), lightened or dark zones are generated on a bluish luminescent
background (depicted as a grayscale image). Coumarin concentrations
of up to 800 ng band–1 generated a dark zone, indicating
a negative impact on the bacterial growth (Figure 3D). Also lower concentrations generated a
dark substance zone during the first minutes of imaging. However,
the effect was not stable over the whole measurement time (30 min),
which indicates an adaption or recovery of the bacteria after some
minutes and therefore only a short-term effect. Also, the observed
cosmetic samples showed various bioactive zones at different hRF values, indicating some kind of bioactive
potential of some of the contained ingredients (Figure 3D). Further investigation would be interesting
to assign the bioactive substances to specific cosmetic ingredients
by HPTLC–ESI-HRMS.

2.9 HPTLC–pYes Bioassay
Coumarin
is not known to show a pronounced hormonal activity. However, cosmetics
in general are repeatedly under discussion because of possible hormone-active
ingredients. Therefore, the cosmetic samples were additionally examined
for a possible endocrine activity of the contained ingredients. To
generate sharply bounded zones, a recently developed workflow on water-wettable
reversed phases was used.36 As to be expected,
coumarin did not show a positive response. However, three cosmetic
samples (Figure 3E,
sunscreen no. 5; cleansing milk no. 11; body lotion 3 no. 16) showed
a clear positive response during the pYES assay, indicated by up to
four blue fluorescent substance bands at UV 366 nm at hRF values between 40 and 65. Also, for the positive control
(C, 150 pg band–1 estradiol), a bright fluorescent
zone was detectable, confirming the accuracy of the bioprofiling method.
Because of the hRF values of the fluorescent
zones and the labeling of the ingredients, the fluorescent substance
bands were assigned to the parabens contained as preservatives and
known for endocrine activity.40 In our
reversed-phase separation, methyl paraben can be found at the highest
and butyl paraben at the lowest hRF value.
In a deodorant of a natural cosmetic manufacturer (no. 1, Table 1, Figure 3E), two slightly fluorescent
zones at similar hRF values as 48 and
53 were observed. A clear assignment to specified compounds of the
ingredient declaration was not possible. It can only
be assumed that the observed weak response may be attributed to natural
ingredients of the used essential oils as it is known that for some
essential oil components like anethol also endocrine activity was
observed.41

2.10 HPTLC–B. subtilis bioassay
Gram-positive B. subtilis bacteria are used to discover potential
antibiotic properties of
a sample and its ingredients. The response is indicated as noncolored
light zones on a deep purple background, attributed to an enzymatic
reaction with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT). In the B. subtilis bioassay,
coumarin did not show any response, not even at as high amounts as
800 ng band–1, indicating no specific antibiotic
potential (Figure 3F). However, the different cosmetic samples showed particularly intense
antibiotic zones at the start zone of sample nos. 16, 19, 13, and
17, apart from various lightly colored antibiotic zones. Noteworthy
with regard to an extreme antibiotic effect is the sunscreen sample
no. 5, for which a large antibiotic area is visible along the separation,
strongest in the upper hRF range between
60 and 75. As many cosmetic products contain preservatives but also
multifunctional ingredients, having combined properties like moisturizing
and antimicrobial properties, it is not surprising that different
samples show a positive response in the microbiological assays (Figure 3D,F). It is unclear
to what extent such cosmetics with extreme antibiotic potential do
impair the natural bacterial colonization on the skin and its protective
function.

3 Conclusions
The
bioprofiling of a wide variety of cosmetic products was developed
and successfully demonstrated. The hyphenation of HPTLC with various
bioassays gave information about the bioactivity of coumarin and other
cosmetic ingredients, being helpful for the legally required safety
assessment of cosmetic products. The method was also suited to screen
a large number of cosmetic products within a short time for their
coumarin content; 19 analyses in parallel took 55 min (application
10 min, chromatography 15 min, derivatization and drying times 15
min, and evaluation 15 min). This corresponded to an overall analysis
time of less than 3.5 min per sample. The solvent consumption was
below 1 mL per sample. Although sample preparation was substantially
reduced (mainly dissolution in oxolane) compared to that in other
chromatographic methods, very good recovery rates, precisions, and
detectabilities (LOQ of 1.3 mg kg–1 for even matrix-rich
cosmetics) were obtained. Thus, this fast, sensitive, and simple HPTLC
method was suited to generate a more valid database regarding the
concentration of coumarin in cosmetics. These data may help in more
precisely estimating to what extent the usage of cosmetics contributes
to the overall coumarin exposure and may be used for further risk
assessment, especially when multiple product usage is considered.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals and Materials
Cosmetic
products, for which coumarin was declared in the ingredients’
list, were purchased from local drugstores or pharmacies. Coumarin
(≥99.0%) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•, 97%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim,
Germany). Potassium hydroxide (>85%), oxolane (≥99.5%),
and
methanol (≥99.9%) were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe,
Germany), and polyethylene glycol 400 was purchased from J.T. Baker
Chemical Co. (Phillipsburg, NJ). Ammonia (25%), paraffin (subliquidum),
and n-hexane (>95%) were obtained from Th. Geyer
(Renningen, Germany). Reagents for the bioassays were referred to
in the respective sections. HPTLC glass plates; silica gel 60, silica
gel 60 F254, and RP-18 WF254s (all 20 ×
10 cm2, layer thickness ca. 200 μm); were delivered
by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. Prior to use, all plates were prewashed
with a mixture of methanol and water (4:1, v/v) up to a migration
distance of 70 mm and dried at 110 °C for 10 min.

4.2 Solutions
An aliquot of each cosmetic
sample (400 mg) was transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and extracted
in 5 mL oxolane in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min. An aliquot of this
solution was directly subjected to HPTLC or diluted appropriately
with oxolane. Slightly cloudy suspensions were additionally centrifuged
at 10 000 × g for 5 min and filtered
through a 4.5 μm membrane filter. The same sample was extracted
twice and analyzed as a twofold determination. The stock solution
of coumarin dissolved in oxolane (5 mg mL–1) was
diluted 1:5000, 1:1000, 1:500, and 1:12.5 with oxolane (1, 5, 10,
and 400 ng μL–1), for standard solutions 1,
2, 3, and 4, respectively.

4.3 Application
Solutions
were sprayed
with Automatic TLC Sampler 4 (ATS4, CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland) as
6 mm bands (4 mm for HPTLC–MS) allowing 18 tracks to be applied
on one HPTLC plate (distances from lower edge 8 mm, from left side
15 mm, and between bands 9.4 mm), for a high sample throughput, even
19 tracks. For quantification, standard solution 2 was applied in
volumes of 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 μL (2.5–20 ng band–1). In most cases, 4.0 μL of each sample was applied twice on
the plate. For linearity, limits of detection (LOD, S/N 3) and quantitation (LOQ, S/N 10), standard solutions 1 and 3 were applied twice ranging
0.2–3.0 and 1.0–4.0 μL, respectively. For repeatability,
the samples were applied threefold between 3.0 and 6.0 μL, and
for reproducibility, between 1.0 and 6.0 μL. For recovery, the
spiked products (1.0 μL each) were applied five times. For effect-directed
detection, the samples ranged 2.0–5.0 μL and coumarin
solution 4 was 2.0 μL.

4.4 Chromatography and Derivatization
After 5 min chamber saturation, chromatography was performed on
HPTLC
plates, silica gel 60, with n-hexane, ethyl acetate,
and ammonia (25%) (3.8:1.3:0.05,
v/v/v), in a twin trough chamber (CAMAG)
up to a migration distance of 55 mm from the lower plate edge. The
development time took about 12 min. The chromatogram was dried on
TLC Plate Heater III (CAMAG) at 50 °C for 5 min. After cooling
to room temperature, the plate was immersed into a 10% methanolic
potassium hydroxide solution (immersion time 2 s, immersion speed
2.5 cm s–1) and again dried on the plate heater
for 5 min. For fluorescence stabilization, the chromatogram was immersed
into a 10% methanolic solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 and
dried for 2 min. Before scanning, the plate was stored for 10 min
in the dark. For HPTLC–pYES, HPTLC plates RP-18 WF254s with a mixture of methanol and water (7:3, v/v), were used.

4.5 Evaluation
Fluorescence measurement
was performed at UV 366/>400 nm using TLC Scanner 3 (CAMAG, slit
size
5 mm × 0.3 mm, scanning speed 20 mm s–1). The
chromatogram was documented by a TLC Visualizer (CAMAG), captured
by a Baumer Optronic DXA252 digital camera with a 12 bit per channel
color depth charge-coupled device (CCD), 100 μm spatial resolution,
1944 × 952 pixel and 1 s exposure time with a gain of 1. Spot
amplification was used to optimize the visual zone intensity. Data
obtained was processed with winCATS 1.4.7.2018 or BioLuminizer 1.0.2.6107
(both CAMAG).

4.6 Method Validation
For recovery, 400
mg of fragrance-free hand cream, deodorant, and body oil were spiked
with 10 and 20 μL of coumarin stock solution (fivefold determination
each), vigorously vortexed (2 × 1 min, Vortex-Genie 2, Scientific
Industries, NY), diluted with 10 mL of oxolane, sonicated for 5 min,
and centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 5 min.
For LOQ calculation in a matrix-rich sample, 40 mg of a fragrance-free
hand cream was spiked with 10, 20, 40, and 80 μL of coumarin
solution 2 (corresponding to 0.0001–0.001%), vigorously vortexed
for 1 min, stored for at least 1 day and dissolved in 1 mL of oxolane
each.

4.7 HPTLC–MS
The elution head-based
TLC–MS Interface (CAMAG, oval elution head 4 × 2 mm2) was connected to the ESI interface of a single quadrupole
mass spectrometer (ExpressIon CMS, Advion, Ithaca, NY). Underivatized
chromatograms were used to avoid clogging of the system by salt deposits.
The zones of interest were marked with a soft pencil (via comparison
with a derivatized strip of the same plate) and eluted with methanol
at a flow rate of 0.1 mL min–1 using a HP 1100 ChemStation
pump (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Mass spectra were recorded in
the full scan mode to obtain the total ion current chromatogram between m/z 50 and 800. The settings in the positive ionization
mode were as follows: capillary voltage 150 V, source voltage 10 V,
capillary temperature and source gas temperature 250 °C, ESI
voltage 4.5 kV, and detector offset 1250. A plate background was taken
at a migration position comparable to the analyte zone (same migration
distance) and was subtracted from the analyte spectrum. Data processing
was performed using Mass Express 1.1.22.15 and Data Express 1.1.22.15
(both Advion).

4.8 HPTLC–DPPH• Assay
For radical-scavenging activity (antioxidant activity),
the chromatogram
was dipped into a 0.5 mM methanolic DPPH• solution37 for 5 s using the TLC Chromatogram Immersion
Device (CAMAG, immersion speed 3.0 cm s–1), dried
in the dark at room temperature for 90 s, heated at 60 °C on
the TLC Plate Heater (CAMAG) for 30 s, and documented with the TLC
Visualizer (CAMAG) at white light illumination (reflectance mode).

4.9 HPTLC–A. fischeri Bioassay
According to Krüger
et al.,38 the dried chromatogram was immersed
into the bacterial suspension (prepared according to DIN EN ISO 11348-1,
part 1, section 5) for 2 s at an immersion speed of 2 cm s–1 and placed into the Bioluminizer (CAMAG). Eleven luminescent plate
images were captured with a cooled 16 bit high-resolution CCD camera
(exposure time 50 s) in time intervals of 3 min until 30 min. To keep
the plate moist during the image recording, the HPTLC plate compartment
was humidified by a water-wetted filter paper (sized 15 × 10
cm2 to cover the free space) and covered by a glass plate.

4.10 HPTLC–pYES Bioassay
According
to Klingelhöfer et al.,36 the dried
chromatogram was automatically immersed into the yeast cell suspension
(immersion speed 3.5 cm s–1, immersion time 5 s),
incubated horizontally under nearly 100% humidity at 30 °C for
3 h, dried under a stream of cold air for 4 min, and immersed into
a buffered methylumbelliferone galactoside solution (0.5 mg mL–1), followed by a second incubation (1 h at 37 °C).
After immersion of the plate into an alkaline solution of glycine
(0.1 M, pH 12), the blue fluorescence of the generated methylumbelliferone
was measured at 366/>400 nm using TLC Scanner 3 (CAMAG). Blue fluorescent
zones indicated compounds with estrogenic activity documented at UV
366 nm (Reprostar 3 documentation system, CAMAG).

4.11 HPTLC–B. subtilis Bioassay
According to Jamshidi-Aidji et al.,39 the chromatogram was immersed into the bacterial
suspension (immersion time 6 s and speed 3.5 cm s–1), incubated horizontally under nearly 100% humidity (2 h at 37 °C)
and immersed into a 0.2% phosphate-buffered saline-buffered MTT solution
(immersion time 1 s and speed 3.5 cm s–1), followed
by further incubation (30 min at 37 °C). The bioautogram was
dried on the TLC plate heater (CAMAG) for 5 min at 50 °C. Because
of the reduction of MTT to formazan, bioactive zones were documented
as bright white substance zones against a purple background with the
TLC Visualizer (CAMAG) at white light illumination in the reflectance
mode.
