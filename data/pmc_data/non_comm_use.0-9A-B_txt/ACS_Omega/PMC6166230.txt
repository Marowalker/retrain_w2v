The
frequencies of notes made by a musical instrument are determined
by the physical properties of the instrument. Consequently, by measuring
the frequency of a note, one can infer information about the instrument’s
physical properties. In this work, we show that by modifying a musical
instrument to contain a sample and analyzing the instrument’s
pitch, we can make precision measurements of the physical properties
of the sample. We used the mbira, a 3000-year-old African musical
instrument that consists of metal tines attached to a wooden board;
these tines are plucked to play musical notes. By replacing the mbira’s
tines with bent steel tubing, filling the tubing with a sample, using
a smartphone to record the sound while plucking the tubing, and measuring
the frequency of the sound using a free software tool on our website,
we can measure the density of the sample with a resolution of about
0.012 g/mL. Unlike existing tools for measuring density, the mbira
sensor can be made and used by virtually anyone in the world. To demonstrate
the mbira sensor’s capabilities, we used it to successfully
distinguish diethylene glycol and glycerol, two similar chemicals
that are sometimes mistaken for each other in pharmaceutical manufacturing
(leading to hundreds of deaths). We also show that consumers could
use mbira sensors to detect counterfeit and adulterated medications
(which represent around 10% of all medications in low- and middle-income
countries). We expect that many other musical instruments can function
as sensors and find important and lifesaving applications.

1 Introduction
Musical
instruments create sound by vibrating at a frequency within
the range of human hearing. Different types of instruments have different
vibrating parts, and this distinction has long been used to categorize
musical instruments. For example, in the Hornbostel–Sachs system
of musical instrument classification, membranophones like drums and
kazoos have vibrating membranes; chordophones like pianos and guitars
have vibrating strings; aerophones like flutes and pipe organs have
vibrating columns of air; and in idiophones like bells and triangles,
the whole instrument vibrates.1

The
precise frequencies of sound created by a musical instrument
are largely determined by the physical properties of that instrument.
For example, the pitch of a drum is a function of the size and tension
of the drum head; the pitch of a guitar is determined by the length,
mass, and tension of the strings; the pitch of a pipe organ is a function
of the length of the pipes; and the pitch of a bell is a function
of its size and shape. When a musician tunes a musical instrument,
they are altering the instrument’s physical properties to obtain
the desired pitch.

The relationship between a musical instrument’s
physical
properties and its sound frequencies raises an interesting prospect:
could an instrument’s sound be used to infer information about
the instrument’s physical properties? More specifically, could
we add a sample to a musical instrument, measure the resulting change
in the instrument’s frequency, and use this change to determine
information about the sample and its properties?

In this work,
we demonstrate that musical instruments can be used
as practical sensors in important real-world applications. For this
initial demonstration, we focused our efforts on the mbira, a 3000-year-old
African musical instrument2 also known
as the karimba, kalimba, or thumb piano.3 The mbira (Figure 1A) usually consists of metal tines of different sizes and lengths
attached to a wooden sounding box; these tines are plucked to create
musical notes. As an idiophone, the mbira’s sound is influenced
by the physical properties of the metal tines: longer or larger tines
create low notes, and shorter or smaller tines create high notes.
In general, the frequency fn of a plucked
mbira tine is 1  where n is the mode of vibration
(n = 1, 2, 3...), λn are eigenvalue solutions of the frequency equation of a cantilever
beam (constants), and the remaining variables are known properties
of the tine: E is Young’s modulus of the tine
material (often steel), I is the second moment of
inertia (a function of the cross-sectional shape of the tine), ρ
is the density of the tine material, A is the cross-sectional
area of the tine, and L is the length of the tine.4Equation 1 shows that at least five different physical properties of
the mbira tine influence the pitch of an mbira note (and could therefore
in principle be measured by analyzing the frequency of an mbira note).

Figure 1 (A) This
conventional mbira musical instrument (left) has 10 metal
tines of different lengths mounted on a wooden sounding box; plucking
the tines creates musical notes. By replacing these tines with a length
of stainless steel tubing bent into a U shape (center), we create
a sensor capable of accurately measuring the density of any sample
inside the tubing with a resolution of 0.012 g/mL. Mbira sensors can
also be made using scrap lumber and hardware (right). (B) Waveform
plot of a sound recording of plucking an mbira sensor, obtained using
a smartphone’s voice recorder app and our analysis website (http://mbira.groverlab.org). The early part of the sound (C) exhibits inharmonic overtones,
whereas the rest of the sound (inset) consists of a pure tone. By
performing a Fourier transform on this portion of the sound, we determine
the fundamental resonance frequency of the tubing, which is inversely
proportional to the density of the sample inside the tubing. Using
the mbira sensor and a smartphone to test river water in California
(D) and bison milk in India (E).

In this study, we primarily focused on ρ, the density
of
the tine material, as our physical property of interest when using
the mbira as a sensor. If we change the density of the tine material,
the frequency of the mbira note will change by a predictable (and
measurable) amount. In particular, if we use hollow tubing as a tine,
then the frequency of the mbira note will be influenced by the density
of the tubing material (which is constant) and the density of the
sample inside the tubing (which can be anything we like). When the
tubing is filled with a low-density sample (like air), the net density
of the tubing is lower, which results in a higher frequency when the
tubing is plucked. When the tubing is filled with a higher-density
material (like water), the net density of the tubing is higher, which
results in a lower frequency. In general, for a hollow-tubing-based
mbira vibrating in its first resonance mode (n =
1), eq 1 becomes 2  where ri is the
inner radius of the tubing, ro is the
outer radius of the tubing, ρt is the density of
the tubing material, and ρs is the density of the
sample inside the tubing. If we know the tubing’s dimensions,
density, and Young’s modulus, we can use eq 2 to predict the frequency of the mbira sensor
when filled with a sample of a density ρs. And even
without any information about the tubing, we can approximate eq 2 as 3  where a and b are calibration constants for a
particular mbira sensor. By measuring
an mbira sensor’s frequency f when filled
with two or more samples of different known densities ρs and plotting f vs ρs, we
can obtain a and b for the mbira
sensor from the slope and Y-intercept of the plot.
Then, by filling the mbira sensor with a sample of unknown density,
measuring the sensor’s frequency, and solving eq 3, we can determine the density of
the sample. Figure 1A shows two mbira density sensors, one made from a commercial musical
instrument (middle) and one made from scrap lumber and hardware from
the author’s garage (right).

Why is measuring sample
density a worthwhile first application
for a musical instrument sensor? Density provides valuable insights
into the physical, chemical, and biological state of a sample. For
example, brewers routinely measure the density of fermenting beverages
to determine the sugar or alcohol content, marine biologists measure
the density of seawater to determine the salt content, and physicians
measure the density of urine to diagnose a range of kidney conditions.
Although several tools exist for accurately measuring the density
of a substance, these tools are precision instruments that require
great skill to fabricate, calibrate, and use.5 For example, hydrometers are glass floats that are placed into the
liquid to be measured; the hydrometer sinks or floats to a height
that is proportional to the density of the surrounding fluid. Hydrometers
can make very precise measurements of fluid density, but they require
glassblowing for fabrication, laborious calibration, relatively large
volumes of sample (hundreds of milliliters), and great care in their
use and storage. Similarly, pycnometers are glass vessels with precisely
known volumes; by filling a pycnometer with a fluid and measuring
its mass, the density of the fluid can be determined. Pycnometers
are also very precise tools for density measurement, but they share
the same disadvantages as hydrometers (and also require the use of
a costly and sensitive analytical balance). Refractometers can measure
a liquid’s index of refraction, which is often proportional
to the liquid’s density. Refractometers require less sample
than hydrometers or pycnometers, but they are only usable with transparent
liquids, and since the precise relationship between refractive index
and density varies for different substances, refractometers cannot
be used to directly measure density without prior knowledge of the
chemical composition of the sample. Finally, vibrating tube densimeters
developed in the 1960s use a continuously oscillating quartz tube
and an electronic readout to measure sample density;6 these sensors are convenient but cost thousands of dollars.
In contrast, the mbira sensor can be made and used by virtually anyone
using scrap materials, requires only a small volume of sample (∼250
μL), requires no calibration to distinguish two samples, and
measures true density.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Distinguishing Samples by Ear Using Mbira
Sensors
To distinguish samples with large differences in
density using an mbira sensor, one can simply hear the different pitches
of the mbira when it is filled with different samples. For example, Figure 2A shows the pitch
of a 50 mm long mbira sensor when filled with air (density = 0 g/mL)
and water (density = 1.00 g/mL), presented using both a scatter plot
and musical notation. When filled with air, the mbira sensor has a
pitch that is close to the G# two octaves
above middle C on the piano (G5#; 830.61 Hz). When filled with
water, the sensor pitch drops to the F# two octaves above middle C (F5#; 739.99 Hz). This frequency difference
corresponds to a major second interval and is easily distinguished
by  ear.

Figure 2 Plot of mbira sensor frequency vs density of tubing contents:
(A)
shows that air and water can be easily distinguished by listening
to the pitch of the sensor; in musical notation, the notes form a
major second interval. Zooming in on the water measurements, (B) reveals
a series of sodium chloride solutions of different densities; their
frequencies are too similar to be distinguished by  ear but are
easily distinguished using our mbira recording analysis website. Error
bars are ±1 standard deviation.

2.2 Measuring Sample Density Using Mbira Sensors
To actually measure the density of a sample (or to distinguish
two samples with similar densities) using the mbira sensor, listening
to the sensor is not enough: we need a way to precisely measure the
musical pitch or frequency of the sensor when filled with the sample.
Various tools exist for measuring the frequency of a musical note,
but we cannot assume that a potential user of an mbira sensor would
have access to these tools. However, we can increasingly assume that
potential users have access to smartphones. As of 2018, there are
5.2 billion active smartphones in the world;7 this means that nearly 70% of the world’s population has
smartphones. To enable any user with an mbira sensor and a smartphone
to make precision density measurements, we created a freely available
online tool that analyzes sound recordings of mbira sensors. To use
the tool, the smartphone’s microphone and built-in sound recording
app are used to record the sound of an mbira sensor being plucked
several times. The user then visits http://mbira.groverlab.org in the smartphone’s web browser and uploads their mbira sensor
sound recording. Our software then identifies the “pings”
in the uploaded file, locates the part of each ping that contains
a pure frequency without overtones (shown in Figure 1C), and performs a Fourier transform on this
section of each ping to determine the frequency of the mbira sensor’s
notes (details in Methods). The average frequency,
uncertainty of the frequency, and other information about the recording
are then returned to the user. This online tool was used to analyze
the mbira sensor measurements in this work.

To demonstrate precision
density measurement using the mbira sensor, we prepared sodium chloride
solutions of known densities (1.00–1.08 g/mL), loaded each
solution into one of our sensors, recorded 15 pings for each solution
using a smartphone, and used our analysis website to measure the frequency
of each ping. Figure 2B plots the average mbira frequency for each fluid density measurement.
By fitting the results to a line and using eq 3, we obtain a slope a = 74.30
Hz/(g/mL), which can be used as a calibration constant when measuring
unknown fluid densities using this mbira sensor.

In another
experiment, we used a smartphone to record 100 pings
of an air-filled mbira sensor. A histogram of the frequencies of these
pings (Supporting Information Figure 1) has an average frequency of 840.8 Hz, with a standard
deviation of 0.44 Hz. This corresponds to a sample density resolution
of 0.012 g/mL for this mbira sensor (obtained using eq 3 and a 95% confidence interval for
the frequency measurement).

2.3 Exploring Optimal Mbira
Sensor Length
Mbiras intended for use as musical instruments
use tines of different
lengths to create notes of different pitches. For example, the mbira
on the left in Figure 1A has 10 tines of lengths ranging from 38 to 57 mm that produce notes
ranging from C3 to E4, a span of more than one
octave. The tine’s pitch is extremely sensitive to its length L: eq 1 predicts
a tine’s frequency varies as  or 1/L2, meaning
that doubling the length of a tine decreases its frequency by a factor
of 4 (a decrease of two octaves).

To explore the effect of tubing
length on the function of our mbira sensors, we varied the tubing
length of an mbira sensor from 50 to 100 mm and used smartphone recordings
and our analysis website to measure the frequency of the sensor at
each length. Figure 3 confirms that doubling the length of the tubing decreases the frequency
by a factor of 4, as predicted by eq 1 (gray curve in Figure 3). This relationship enables us to easily create mbira
sensors that operate in a desired frequency range. Additionally, we
observed that the difference between frequencies of air- and water-filled
mbira sensors is greatest in sensors with shorter tubing. Therefore,
for maximum density sensitivity, the length of the mbira sensor should
be kept as short as possible. In practice, we found mbira sensors
shorter than 50 mm to be relatively inflexible and difficult to pluck
by hand so we established 50 mm as a practical lower limit on mbira
sensor length.

Figure 3 Frequency of an mbira sensor containing air (black points)
and
water (blue points) while varying the tubing length from 50 to 100
mm, represented as both a conventional plot (top) and musical notation
(bottom). As predicted by eq 1 (gray lines), doubling the tubing length decreases the sensor’s
frequency by a factor of 4 or a decrease of two octaves in musical
notation. Additionally, the difference in frequency between air and
water increases as tube length decreases, indicating that shorter
mbira sensors are more sensitive density sensors. Error bars are ±1
standard deviation.

2.4 Exploring
Optimal Tubing Cross-Sectional Dimensions
The tubing we use
in our mbira sensors is available in virtually
any desired cross-sectional dimensions (usually expressed as inner
diameter and outer diameter, or inner radius ri and outer radius ro in eq 2). We hypothesized that
using tubing with a larger ratio ri/ro will improve the sensitivity of our mbira
sensors because more of the vibrating mass will be sample (not tubing
material). In other words, keeping the tubing wall as thin as possible
should maximize the effect of sample density on the mass (and frequency)
of the tubing.

To test this hypothesis, we built mbira sensors
using tubing with various values for inner radius ri and outer radius ro and
measured the frequencies of these sensors when filled with air and
water. Figure 4A,B
compares representative results from two sensors with different cross-sectional
dimensions. The tubing in Figure 4A has ri = 0.90 mm and ro = 1.21 mm for a ratio ri/ro = 0.74, and the tubing in Figure 4B has ri = 1.27 mm and ro = 1.53
mm for a ratio ri/ro = 0.83 (similar results from additional tubing dimensions
are provided in the Supporting Information). Since the tubing in Figure 4B has the larger ratio ri/ro, we predict it will be more sensitive to sample
density differences, and our measurements support this prediction:
the larger difference in measured frequencies between the air and
water measurements in Figure 4B confirms that this sensor is more sensitive to sample density
differences than the sensor in Figure 4A. These and other measurements confirm our hypothesis
that for maximum sensitivity, mbira sensors should be built using
tubing with ri/ro as large as possible (i.e., tubing with a thin wall).

Figure 4 (A) Mbira sensor
frequency vs tubing length for a sensor built
using stainless steel tubing with an inner radius ri = 0.90 mm and an outer radius ro = 1.21 mm, when filled with air (back points) and water (blue
points). (B) Repeating the experiments in (A) using tubing with ri = 1.27 mm and ro = 1.53 mm (see cross-sectional scale models for comparison). The
larger ratio ri/ro in (B) means more of the mbira sensor’s mass is filled
with sample, which results in a more sensitive sensor (a larger separation
between the air and water measurements in (B)). (C) Correlation between
mbira sensor frequencies predicted by eq 2 and the experimentally measured frequencies for all
90 mbira sensor experiments in this study. In each case, eq 2 successfully predicted the frequency
of the mbira sensors.

2.5 Validating Our Model for Mbira Sensors
The gray curves in Figures 3 and 4A,B are predictions made using eq 2; they agree well with
the experimental data shown in those figures. To demonstrate that eq 2 applies to a wide variety
of different mbira sensor experiments (not just the ones shown in
these figures), we used eq 2 to predict the frequency of all 90 mbira sensor experiments
we performed in this study. These experiments include six different
tubing lengths, six different sample densities, and three different
tubing cross-sectional dimensions. Figure 4C confirms a very close agreement between
predicted and measured frequencies.

2.6 Detecting
Counterfeit Medications Using Mbira
Sensors
The World Health Organization estimates that 10%
of all medicines in low- and middle-income countries are counterfeit.8 These counterfeit drugs not only waste tens of
billions of dollars each year, but they also endanger health, prolong
illness, promote the spread of drug-resistant pathogens, undermine
public confidence in healthcare, and fund criminal syndicates.8 There is an urgent unmet need for simple tools
that healthcare professionals and consumers can use to distinguish
counterfeit drugs from authentic ones.9

If two drugs have different densities, they must have different
ingredients. We can use this fact to identify a counterfeit drug by
comparing its density to the density of a known authentic sample of
the drug. Interestingly, when using an mbira sensor to perform this
analysis, it is unnecessary to calibrate the sensor. One need only
compare the frequencies of an mbira sensor when filled with the samples
of suspect and authentic drugs; if the frequencies differ by a statistically
significant amount, then the suspect drug is known to be chemically
different from the authentic drug.

To use an mbira sensor to
distinguish authentic and counterfeit
versions of a particular drug, we assume that the density of the authentic
drug remains constant over time (in other words, samples of the drug
manufactured on different dates have the same density). To confirm
this, we used mbira sensors to measure the density of six samples
of a known authentic drug with different lot numbers and expiration
dates. We used NyQuil Severe Cold and Flu medicine (a liquid medication
containing acetaminophen, phenylephrine, doxylamine succinate, dextromethorphan,
and glycerol) with expiration dates (and, presumably, manufacture
dates) spanning a four-month period (see Table 1). The measured frequencies of our mbira
sensor when filled with these six drugs never differed by more than
0.187 Hz (a 0.025% difference); this difference is not statistically
significant and supports the claim that all six samples of the medication
are identical (Figure 5, left). If a drug claiming to be NyQuil Severe Cold and Flu medicine
was measured with this mbira sensor and found to have a frequency
other than 735 Hz, this would be strong evidence that the drug is
counterfeit or otherwise adulterated. We believe that any consumer
with an mbira sensor, a smartphone, and a known authentic sample of
a drug can use this procedure to test the authenticity of a suspect
sample of the drug.

Figure 5 Using the frequency of an uncalibrated mbira sensor to
determine
the authenticity of medicines and identify toxic pharmaceutical ingredients.
The frequency of an mbira sensor does not significantly change when
the sensor is filled with commercial liquid cold medicine from six
different manufacturer’s lots (left); this supports the claim
that the medications are all identical. If a consumer measured a significantly
different frequency for one of the medications, this would be definitive
proof that the medication is chemically different from the others
and may be counterfeit or adulterated. When the same mbira sensor
is filled with toxic diethylene glycol and nontoxic glycerol (right),
the resulting sensor frequencies are significantly different (p < 0.001) due to the slightly different densities of
the substances; this confirms that an uncalibrated mbira sensor can
easily distinguish two similar chemicals that are sometimes tragically
mistaken for each other in drug manufacturing. Error bars are ±1
standard deviation.

2.7 Identifying Toxic Substances Using Mbira Sensors
To
demonstrate that the mbira sensor can be used to identify (or
rule out) a substance by its density, we used an mbira sensor to discriminate
between glycerol and diethylene glycol, two very similar substances
that are occasionally mistaken for each other (sometimes with deadly
consequences). Glycerol, a sweet-tasting, viscous, clear liquid, has
long been used as an excipient in liquid medications like cough sirup.
In 1937, a chemist at the S. E. Massengill Company in Bristol, Virginia
was developing a liquid form of the early antibiotic sulfanilamide;
he attempted to dissolve the sulfanilamide in glycerol but found it
was insoluble. He then discovered that sulfanilamide does dissolve
in another sweet-tasting, viscous, clear liquid: diethylene glycol.
One hundred and sixty gallons of this diethylene glycol-based “Elixir
Sulfanilamide” were produced and sold across the U.S. before
reports surfaced of patients who died shortly after taking the drug.
A massive government recall effort limited the number of deaths caused
by Elixir Sulfanilamide to about 100, and the toxicity of diethylene
glycol became common knowledge.10,11 But incredibly, this
was far from the last time that diethylene glycol would be substituted
for glycerol in medication. Since 1985, fatal mass poisoning caused
by medicines containing diethylene glycol has been occurring somewhere
in the world on an average of every 2 years, with a combined death
toll in the hundreds.12 And while
many techniques exist that can easily distinguish between toxic diethylene
glycol and benign glycerol (techniques like gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy), these techniques require
expensive and complex instruments, and pharmaceutical companies in
developing regions do not always use these techniques to confirm the
identity of the chemicals they use. A simple and low-cost method for
distinguishing between glycerol and diethylene glycol could help these
pharmaceutical companies confirm the safety of their products and
save hundreds of lives.

The densities of toxic diethylene glycol
(1.118 g/mL) and nontoxic glycerol (1.261 g/mL) differ by only about
13%, but this difference is easily detectable using an mbira sensor. Figure 5 (right) compares
the measured frequencies of an mbira sensor filled with diethylene
glycol and glycerol. The ∼10 Hz difference in measured frequencies
is statistically significant (p < 0.001) and confirms
that the two substances are chemically different. This demonstrates
that uncalibrated mbira sensors can be used to distinguish two similar
substances by their densities.

3 Conclusions
We have demonstrated that a 3000-year-old musical instrument can
make a surprisingly good sensor, a sensor that can be applied to problems
as diverse as identifying toxic substances and detecting counterfeit
drugs. The mbira sensor is easy and inexpensive to build: in addition
to the steel-based sensors shown here, we have also built functional
mbira sensors out of discarded plastic pipets, lengths of flexible
tubing stretched like guitar strings, and other commonplace materials.
And the mbira sensor is simple and economical to use, requiring only
a smartphone to analyze the sensor’s pitch and determine the
density of its contents with high precision.

In this work, we
focused on using the mbira to measure sample density.
However, in principle, an mbira could be used to measure any of the
values in eq 2. For example,
this equation suggests that mbira instruments might be even better
at length measurement than density measurement: although doubling
the density of the mbira tine material decreases the tine’s
frequency by a factor of √2 or ∼1.4, doubling the length
of a mbira tine decreases the tine’s frequency by a factor
of 4. In fact, using the uncertainty in our mbira frequency measurements
of 0.44 Hz, we estimate that by measuring the frequency of a properly
calibrated mbira, one could determine the length of the tine with
a resolution of 24 μm, about the size of a single white blood
cell. We are currently exploring the potential for mbira sensors as
simple and inexpensive but precise length measurement tools in various
applications.

The mbira sensor is also interesting for bridging
the worlds of
science and art. As a scientific instrument and a musical instrument,
the mbira sensor blurs the line between measurement and music. This
enables novel ways of thinking about the mbira sensor and its data,
such as the musical notation shown in Figures 2 and 3. We have found
that describing our work in terms of science and music makes our research
accessible to a broader audience: nonscientists readily recognize
the mbira instrument, see the different musical notes corresponding
to different samples in the mbira, and immediately understand how
the mbira sensor works. To encourage other researchers to do the same,
we created a free and open-source software tool that converts frequency
measurements to musical notation13 and
used this tool to create Figures 2 and 3.

Finally, it is
worthwhile to note that the mbira is but one of
the hundreds and hundreds of different musical instruments in the
world. In principle, any musical instrument could be used as a sensor.
The vibrating elements in a musical instrument seem particularly well
suited for use in measuring physical properties, and since all objects
have fundamental physical properties like mass, density, and length,
musical instrument sensors that measure these properties should find
many different applications. However, there is no reason to assume
that musical instruments are limited to sensing these properties.
Any physical, chemical, or biological phenomena that reproducibly
alters the pitch-determining properties of a musical instrument could
in principle be measured by the instrument. We hope that our work
inspires a search for musical instruments (both modern and ancient)
that can function as useful sensors and solve important problems.

4 Methods
4.1 Making Mbira Sensors
In principle,
any object that (a) can contain a sample inside it and (b) has the
right shape and rigidity to vibrate when mounted on a board and plucked,
could be used as an mbira sensor. In this work, we used ready-made
inexpensive stainless steel tubing with different inner and outer
diameters. The tubes were bent into a U shape and clamped at different
lengths ranging from 50 to 100 mm. Bending sometimes causes this tubing
to collapse at the bend (see Figure 1A, right), but as long as the path for fluid through
the tubing remains unobstructed, the tubing will still function as
a sensor. The bent metal tubing is then mounted to an object that
serves as a sound board, which amplifies the sound of the vibrating
tubing. In this work, we mounted tubing to wooden sound boxes scavenged
from commercial mbira instruments (Figure 1A, center) and scrap wooden boards (Figure 1A, right).

Our results in Figure 3 indicate that shorter (and therefore higher frequency) mbira sensors
are generally more sensitive than longer (lower frequency) sensors.
Theoretically, with a tubing outer radius ro = 3.05 mm and inner radius ri = 2.54
mm, an mbira sensor with a length L of approximately
4 mm would have a frequency of approximately 20 000 Hz (the
maximum audible frequency for humans); however, this is not practical
because of the difficulty of manually pinging such a short sensor
and recording such a low-amplitude sound using a smartphone. In practice,
we found that ∼50 mm long sensors had the highest sensitivity
without sacrificing the ease of use of the sensors or the quality
of the sound recordings.

4.2 Mbira Sensor Calibration
To measure
sample density using an mbira sensor, the sensor must first be calibrated
using two or more materials with known densities (note that this calibration
is unnecessary when using the mbira sensor to determine whether two
samples are different). We prepared sodium chloride solutions with
precisely known densities by combining masses of NaCl and water, as
calculated by our software tool NaCl.py.14 A typical calibration curve is shown in Figure 2, and additional curves for mbira sensors
with other tubing lengths are provided in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Analyzing
Mbira Sensor Data
Analyzing
sound data from musical instruments can be challenging because of
the complexity of the sounds. For example, as shown in Figure 1C, the initial portion of an
mbira note (the “attack”) has inharmonic overtones that
obscure the primary resonance frequency of the note.4 We developed a website (http://mbira.groverlab.org) that runs a custom Python program that analyzes sound recordings
of mbira sensors. After the user uploads a sound file containing recordings
of several pings of an mbira sensor filled with a sample, the software
first locates the high-quality portions of the audio recording. It
accomplishes this using three user-specified thresholds. First, a
ping entry threshold is crossed when the audio signal exceeds 50%
of the maximum signal; this marks the beginning of the ping. Second,
a signal threshold is crossed when the audio signal drops below 40%
of the maximum signal. This marks the beginning of the portion of
the signal that has a single dominant frequency (and therefore will
be used for frequency analysis). Finally, a baseline threshold is
crossed when the audio signal drops below 1% of the maximum signal.
This marks the end of the ping and the end of the portion of the signal
to be analyzed. The reported values for these thresholds were used
for all of the mbira sensor data analyzed in this work; however, if
necessary these thresholds can be modified by the user on our analysis
website. Once the portion of each ping to be analyzed is identified
using these thresholds, the software applies a Hanning window to the
signal to reduce spectral leakage, then performs a fast Fourier transform
to determine the frequency of the ping. This process is repeated for
each ping in a recording, and the website finally provides the user
with the average ping frequency, plots of each ping, and other statistics.

4.4 Measuring Pharmaceuticals and Drug Ingredients
with Mbira Sensors
Six bottles of liquid cold medicine (NyQuil
Severe Cold and Flu, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) with different
lot numbers and expiration dates were obtained from pharmacies in
Riverside, California. A sample from each bottle was loaded into an
mbira sensor using a syringe. For each sample, a volume approximately
3 times the volume of the tubing was flushed through the tubing to
ensure complete removal of water used to rinse the sensor between
samples. The tubing was plucked 15 times for each sample and recorded
using a Samsung S6 smartphone. Diethylene glycol and glycerol samples
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were also measured in this manner,
with additional rinsing between samples using water and air.
