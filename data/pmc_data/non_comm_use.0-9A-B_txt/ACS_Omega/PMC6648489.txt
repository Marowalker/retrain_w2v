Microporous
activated carbon was prepared by depositing and pyrolyzing propylene
within the microporous voids of SAPO-37 and subsequently removing
the template by a treatment with HCl and NaOH. The carbon had a high
surface area and large micropore and ultramicropore volumes. The yield,
crystallinity, morphology, and adsorption properties compared well
with those of a structurally related zeolite-Y-templated carbon. No
HF was needed to remove the SAPO-37 template in contrast to the zeolite
Y template, which could be of industrial importance.

1 Introduction
Activated carbons (ACs) are commercialized adsorbents for water
and gas purification and electrode materials in double-layer-based
supercapacitors, and the corresponding research fields are active.1−3 There has been a growing interest in preparing three-dimensionally
connected ACs with regularly arrayed micropores using zeolites as
templates.4,5 Because of the interconnectivities, such
ACs are expected to have high electric conductivities and are attractive
for use in applications that demand high conductivities and capacitances.5−8

Zeolite-templated carbons are, in general, prepared by first
depositing and pyrolyzing carbon precursors within the zeolite and
then dissolving the zeolite template.9−11 Zeolites are crystalline
and microporous (pores < 2 nm) aluminosilicates with general structures
described by three-letter framework-type codes.12,13 Furfuryl alcohol, propylene, acetylene, and acetonitrile are examples
of suitable carbon precursors, and FAU, MOR, LTA, BEA, and MFI types
of zeolites have been used as templates.14−18

A stoichiometric removal of the zeolite framework
is normally promoted by HF (or sometimes by NaOH) under hydrothermal
conditions;19−21 however, as HF imposes safety hazards, it limits
the options for industrialization. With hydrothermal treatment using
NaOH, zeolites are sometimes dissolved and recrystallized. For instance,
Tendeloo et al. showed that a commercial NH4+-Y zeolite transformed into five different framework types depending
on the cations of the base; however, with NaOH, the zeolite Y framework
largely persisted.22

The large class
of crystalline and microporous aluminophosphates (AlPO4s)23 is isoelectronic to microporous silicates
(SiO2), with alternating and oxygen-linked aluminum and
phosphorous atoms. Their frameworks are mainly covalently bonded and
have no net charge. However, the chemistry of AlPO4s and
microporous silicates (SiO2) is different and AlPO4s can be dissolved in aqueous solutions of HCl.24−26 Even though this chemical difference is promising for the use of
AlPO4s to derive ACs, only a limited amount of work has
been performed. One previous study has shown that carbon nanotubes
can be synthesized within the channels of an AlPO4-5 material.27 However, its one-dimensional pore system makes
it less useful for the synthesis of ACs, which requires at least two-dimensional
pore systems with large pore window apertures and high thermal stabilities.16 These requirements for suitability met in a
related class of templates, the microporous silicoaluminophosphates
(SAPOs). Similar to zeolites (aluminosilicates), SAPOs have a negatively
charged framework, but Si (formal charge of 4+) replaces P (formal
charge of 5+).28

FAU-type zeolites
have been particularly successful in synthesizing zeolite-templated
AC;15,17,29−34 however, microporous AlPO4s with FAU frameworks have
not been synthesized yet. SAPO-37 is FAU-structured.35,36 In addition to having a three-dimensional structure, large pores,
and pore window apertures, H-SAPO-37 is highly acidic and its −OH
groups are thermally stable.37 H-SAPO-37
is thermally stable up to 1000 °C but becomes amorphous in an
ambient atmosphere when being exposed to water vapor.38 The high thermal stability and acidity of H-SAPO-37 are
advantageous for infiltration and deposition of carbon precursors
at high temperatures. Its low hydrothermal stability, on the other
hand, makes it promising for dissolution under mild conditions.39,40 Wu et al.41 used sulfuric acid as a catalyst,
sucrose as a carbon precursor, and SAPO-11 and SAPO-34 as agents to
achieve mesoporous carbons. To the best of our knowledge, we here
present, for the first time, the synthesis of AC derived from the
microporous interiors of a SAPO, whose framework could be removed
under mild conditions without using HF.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the
as-made SAPO-37 templates, the template-AC composites, and ACs. As
can be seen in Figure 1a, the as-made SAPO-37 had a typical characteristic pattern of the
FAU structure with narrow and intense peaks typical of a material
of high crystallinity. The ACs were successfully prepared using the
pure SAPO-37 and zeolite Y templates, as shown below.

Figure 1 Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns of the (a) as-made silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO)-37, (b)
SAPO-37-activated carbon (AC) composite, (c) SAPO-37-templated AC,
and (d) zeolite-Y-templated AC.

The positions of the PXRD peaks shifted toward higher angles
for the SAPO-37-AC composite (Figure 1b) as compared to those for the as-made SAPO-37 (Figure 1a), indicating that
the SAPO-37 framework was well retained within the SAPO-37-AC composite
after the propylene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) but the unit cell
had shrunk slightly upon the thermal treatment. The SAPO-37-templated
AC had one broad XRD diffraction peak (Figure 1c) at 2θ around 6°, which we attribute
to the replication of the FAU framework 111. This peak is commonly
visible also for zeolite-Y-templated ACs presented in the literature42,43 and is also detected in the reference material (zeolite-Y-templated
AC), which had a comparably narrow peak at 2θ = 6.8° (Figure 1d). The reference
material thus seems to display a higher degree of structural regularity
than the SAPO-37-templated AC. However, for both ACs, no peak at 2θ
= ∼22° for layered graphite was observed in Figure 1c,d, suggesting that no or
little carbon has been deposited on the external surfaces of the zeolite
Y or SAPO-37 crystals during the propylene CVD. (Note that some allotments
of the ACs had a diffraction peak at 2θ = 18.2°, which
was assigned to an impurity polytetrafluoroethylene.44) The particle morphologies of the templated ACs are relevant
to understanding the mechanisms of formation and, potentially, their
applications. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the morphologies, and
the results are shown in Figure 2. The crystals of SAPO-37 and the SAPO-37-templated
AC (after the removal of the SAPO) have an octahedral shape (Figure 2b,d). The average
particle size of 1180 nm for SAPO-37-templated AC is smaller than
that of 1690 nm for the SAPO-37 template, which is attributed to the
SAPO-37 unit cell shrinkage during thermal treatment as discussed
for the XRD peak shift. Moreover, the surfaces of the SAPO-37-templated
AC appear smooth from the TEM image in Figure 2d (and its SEM image in Figure S1a as well), in contrast to the rough surfaces of
carbon materials that have been ascribed to core–shell morphologies
for AlPO4-5-templated carbons.45 This morphology-based information supports the hypothesis that the
carbon has been deposited within the nanometer-sized cages of the
SAPO-37 crystals. The conserved octahedral morphology in the SAPO-37-templated
AC strongly supports the hypothesis that the propylene CVD functioned
well and that the carbon precursor has penetrated well into the SAPO-37
template. Similar findings were observed for the zeolite Y and its
corresponding zeolite-Y-templated AC in Figure 2a,c. The average crystal size of zeolite
Y was smaller than that of SAPO-37 (compare the features in Figure 2a,b). Likewise, the
morphology of the zeolite Y crystals was also conserved in the zeolite-Y-templated
AC.

electron microscopy (TEM) image and particle size distribution of
SAPO-37-templated AC. High-resolution TEM images of (e) zeolite-Y-templated
AC and its Fourier transform (inset) and (f) SAPO-37-templated AC
and its diffraction pattern (inset).

High-resolution TEM is a well-established method to study
features of zeolite-Y-templated AC,42,46−50 and Figure 2e displays
the HRTEM image of the zeolite-Y-templated AC. Although some defects
were observed in the images of the carbon network, regular ordered
lattice fringes were also observed, confirming that the zeolite-Y-templated
AC retained at least some of the organized porous network of the zeolite
Y template. The measured interfringe distance was 1.30 ± 0.01
nm, in agreement with the d value calculated from
the powder diffraction peak (2θ at 6.8° for Cu Kα
radiation). The Fourier transform of this image exhibits a pair of
spots at the positions corresponding to the 111 reflection of zeolite
Y (see the inset in Figure 2e). For the SAPO-37-templated AC, no obvious regular structure
with respect to a replication of the FAU framework in the plane of
(111) can be observed by TEM (Figure S1b). This is consistent with the broad powder diffraction peak (2θ)
at 6.8° in Figure 1c. As shown in Figure 2f, ordered structures are observed in some areas of the HRTEM images
of the SAPO-37-templated AC; however, the relative amounts of these
structures appear to be too low to display defined peaks in the PXRD
pattern. For these features, the interspace distance calculated from
the reflections as marked by the arrow in the SAED patterns is 0.37
nm, which is close to the interlayer distance d002 of turbostratic carbon and carbon black.51−56 Additionally, TEM-EDS analysis indicates that the ACs are relatively
pure, as only small amounts of the SAPO-37 and zeolite Y matrices
were detected in the corresponding ACs (see Table S1 and Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), although the
TEM-EDS analysis included carbon signal from the holy carbon-coated
grid unavoidably.

Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) can
be used to determine the graphitization degree or the fraction of
sp2/sp3 carbon in carbon materials.57−60 In this work, the fraction of sp2/sp3 carbon
for the ACs was estimated by EELS by analyzing the near-edge fine
structure of the carbon ionization edge. The methodology used follows
that of Urbonaite and Jeanne-Rose.61,62 Deconvolution
of bands in the EELS spectra in the carbon K-edge region in Figure 3 indicated strongly
that the SAPO-37-templated AC had a higher fraction of sp2/sp3 carbon than the zeolite-Y-templated analogues as
indicated below.

Figure 3 Deconvolution of bands in the EELS spectra in the carbon
K-edge region the silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO)-37- and zeolite-Y-templated
carbons.

Figure 3 presents the EELS spectra of SAPO-37- and
zeolite-Y-templated ACs. The fraction of sp2/sp3 carbon of these two curves has been shown to be related to the hybridization
of the carbon atoms, and a series of Gaussian peaks were fitted to
the deconvolved, background-subtracted C-K edge under the σ*
and π* edges based on the method reported by Papworth et al.63 Quantitative calculations show that the spectrum
of the SAPO-37-templated AC has a statistically higher ratio for the
π* peak to the σ* peak, namely, the fraction of sp2/sp3 carbon, (0.634 ± 0.002) than that of
zeolite-Y-templated AC (0.469 ± 0.001). While we do not have
access to the absolute sp2/sp3 hybridization
for this study due to the lack of a standard, we do observe an obvious
increase in the π*/σ* ratio for the SAPO-37-templated
and zeolite-Y-templated ACs than that for the amorphous carbon (Figure S3). We interpret this increase as a higher
fraction of sp2/sp3 carbon of these two ACs
compared to that of the amorphous carbon.

TGA was performed
to study how well the CVD procedure had proceeded and the thermal
stability of the ACs. Analysis of the TGA traces recorded in dry air
for both the SAPO-37 and zeolite Y AC composites yields carbon fractions
of 0.2 and 0.3 g/g in these composites, respectively. The higher fraction
of carbon with zeolite Y could relate to difference in particle size
or chemistry.

The carbon matrix was oxidized at a comparably
high temperature of ∼650 °C (Figure 4a,b), and the high temperature was consistent
with carbon deposited within the nanometer-sized cages of the templates.
The TGA trace of the SAPO-37-templated AC (Figure 4c), recorded in air, indicates that oxidation
reactions occur mainly at temperatures of 450–550 °C;
the AC has a relatively high thermal oxidation stability. Less than
5 wt % of ash was left after oxidizing the SAPO-37-templated AC in
the TG instrument. This low ash amount was consistent with the ICP-OES
elemental analysis result of the SAPO-37-templated AC (Table S2 in the Supporting Information), which
shows that there was only a minor trace of the SAPO-37 matrix in the
sample.

carbon (AC) composite, (b) zeolite-Y-AC composite, and (c) SAPO-37-templated
AC after the dissolution of SAPO-37.

Raman and IR spectroscopies were used to study aspects of
the ordering of the carbon domains and functional groups in the ACs.
The SAPO-37- and zeolite-Y-templated ACs had Raman and IR spectra
with typical bands for carbon materials.64,65 In the Raman spectra of both ACs (Figure 5a), two distinctive Raman bands were observed.
The G band at around 1580–1600 cm–1 can be
described as C–C stretching, whereas the D band at around 1350
cm–1 represents a global vibration mode of the aromatic
rings.65 The peak broadening in the Raman
spectral bands indicates an atomically disordered arrangement of the
carbon atoms. The IR spectra of both ACs (Figure 5b) showed band features assigned to -OH (around
3400 cm–1) and carbonyl groups (around 1600 cm–1).63 For the SAPO-37-templated
AC, the band-related feature at ∼1300 cm–1 in Figure 5b is consistent
with vibrational bands of phosphate or polyphosphate moieties.66

(SAPO)-37-templated (black) and zeolite-Y-templated (red) activated
carbons.

The N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements were carried to measure the surface area and porosity
of SAPO-37- and zeolite-Y-templated ACs. As is shown in Table 1, both the SAPO-37- and zeolite-Y-templated
ACs display high specific surface areas and relatively large micropore
volumes, with the zeolite-Y-templated AC displaying larger values.
The shapes of the N2 isotherms (Figure 6a) of the SAPO-37- and zeolite-Y-templated
ACs differ slightly. The isotherm for the zeolite-Y-templated AC has
a clear microporosity combined with a hysteresis loop at p/p0 = 0.4–1.0, typical for a measurable
fraction of mesopores with a wide pore size distribution. The isotherm
for the SAPO-37-templated AC is of a type I microporous material.

°C, and (b) CO2 adsorption and desorption isotherms
recorded at 0 °C on a silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO)-templated
activated carbon (AC, black) and a zeolite-Y-templated AC (red).

Zeolite-Y-templated AC	2460	0.6	966	
SAPO-37-templated AC	1690	0.4	705	
The adsorption and desorption of
CO2 at 0 °C are typically studied for ACs to access
the influence of pores smaller than those accessed by N2. As shown in Figure 6b, the SAPO-37-templated AC has a higher uptake of CO2 than the zeolite-Y-templated AC, typical for a material with a larger
volume of ultramicropores.

The pore size distributions (PSDs)
displayed in Figure 7 were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) method under
the assumption of slit-shaped pores. The SAPO-37-templated AC had
a near identical micropore and ultramicropore distributions for the
zeolite-Y-templated AC. The PSDs derived from the N2 adsorption
data at −196 °C is shown in Figure 7a. From these traces, it can be seen that
the SAPO-37-templated AC has a similar pore size in the range of 1–2
nm as compared to that of the zeolite-Y-templated AC. The PSDs of
ultrasmall micropores were derived from CO2 adsorption
data recorded at 0 °C. As is shown in Figure 7b, the SAPO-37-templated AC had a larger
amount of ultramicropores in the range of 0.4–0.7 nm than the
zeolite-Y-templated AC.

3 Conclusions
A microporous
AC with the interior replica of the micropores of a SAPO template
was synthesized for the first time. The SAPO-37-templated AC had a
high specific surface area, large micropore volume, and a large volume
of ultrasmall micropores. With its well-defined and only micropores,
the SAPO-37-templated AC could be important to certain gas separation
processes, where kinetic separation or even molecular sieving is of
importance, and with a potential of higher electric conductivity than
regular ACs prepared at a similar temperature, it has the potential
in electrochemical applications and in supercapacitors. SAPO-37-templated
AC would have similar advantages over regular ACs as the very well
studied zeolite Y template ones, but the SAPO template could be removed
without the use of HF, which could have positive ramifications for
its industrial adaptation. This first example of a SAPO-37-templated
microporous AC with SAPO’s interior replica could open up for
further studies in relation to various applications of such carbons.
Open questions remain with respect to the role of phosphorous atoms
during the CVD and the thermal annealing steps, which could motivate
in situ studies of the related high-temperature chemistry. As microporous
SAPO and AlPO4 framework materials have a large variety
of structures, we expect further options for preparing a relatively
wide array of porous templated carbons and ACs with new structures
and functionalities.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 40
wt % in water) was from Alfa Aesar. Phosphoric acid (85 wt % in water)
and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (25 wt % in water) were from Sigma
Aldrich, and 2 vol % propylene in N2 (Strandmöllen)
was used as received. The reference material zeolite Y (H form, Si/Al
= 30) was purchased from Zeolyst.

4.2 Synthesis
of SAPO-37
SAPO-37 was synthesized according to the reported
procedure.67 A gel was prepared with a
composition of 0.05 tetramethylammonium:2 tetrapropylammonium:Al2O3:P2O5:0.5 SiO2:50 H2O. The gel was homogenized and transferred into
Teflon-lined autoclaves and heated at a temperature of 200 °C
for 16 h. Subsequently, the autoclaves were quenched with cold water.
The solids were centrifuged and washed with distilled water.

4.3 Deposition of Carbons
Carbon was deposited and pyrolyzed
in the SAPO-37 and zeolite Y templates by chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) with propylene using a procedure similar to an earlier reported
method. Furfuryl alcohol impregnation/polymerization was not used.43 As-made SAPO-37 (with the TPAOH template) was
compressed into a pellet with a diameter of 2 cm. This pellet was
loaded into a vertical tube furnace with a quartz reactor, and the
organic template in the as-made SAPO-37 was pyrolyzed in a flow of
N2 (100 mL/min) at a temperature of 600 °C for 12
h. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 800 °C, after
which the gas was switched to dilute propylene in N2. After
propylene CVD for 4 h, the SAPO-37-AC composite was rigidified by
heat treatment in a flow of N2 at a temperature of 900
°C. As a reference material, a zeolite-Y-AC composite was prepared
using the same procedure.

4.4 Recovery of Carbons by
Dissolution of SAPO-37 and Zeolite Y
The SAPO-37-AC composite
(0.5 g) was successively washed with aqueous solutions of 2 mol/dm3 HCl and then 2 mol/dm3 NaOH solutions at 60 °C.
The remaining solids were recovered by centrifugation and subsequently
washed with distilled water. An attempt to dissolve the zeolite Y
template with the same procedure was unsuccessful. Instead, the zeolite-Y-AC
composite was dissolved using an aqueous solution of 2 mol/dm3 HCl and 2 mol/dm3 HF at 60 °C. The remaining
solids were also recovered by centrifugation and subsequent washing
with distilled water.

4.5 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data was collected on a PANalytical
X’Pert Pro diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å). Morphologies were examined by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL JSM-7000 microscope with an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) experiments were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100F field-emission
electron microscope, operating at 200 kV. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy
(EELS) was performed using a postcolumn Gatan Image Filter (GIF Tridium),
whereas the TEM was operated in scanning TEM (STEM) mode. Further
experimental details are provided in the Supporting Information. The elemental compositions were determined with
TEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). For the TEM, EELS,
and EDS experiments, powders of the samples were ultrasonically dispersed
in ethanol at room temperature for 2 min and then transferred onto
a grid by dipping (continuous carbon-coated copper grids were used
for TEM images, and holy carbon-coated copper grids were used for
EELS and EDS). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in a
flow of dry air with a TA Instruments Discovery TG. The samples were
heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10
°C/min. Basic elemental content of C, H, and N was measured by
combustion analysis, and the possible elements from the templates
were measured by ICP-OES following acid digestion (nitric and HF acid).
A Varian 670 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer was used
to record IR spectra in a transmission mode using a KBr-pellet method.
The Raman spectra were recorded with a LabRAM HR 800 instrument using
a 532 nm laser. The porosities were analyzed with a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 instrument using N2-adsorption data recorded
at a temperature of −196 °C, and CO2 adsorption
data were recorded at 0 °C. Samples were degassed at 200 °C
for 6 h before the adsorption experiments. The surface areas were
calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method
using the N2-adsorption data. The relative pressures used
for the BET method were selected ensuring a positive intersection
with the y-axis and a Rouquerol transformation that increased with
the relative pressure.68 The pore size
distributions were calculated by a density functional theory (DFT)
assuming a slit-shaped pore geometry.
