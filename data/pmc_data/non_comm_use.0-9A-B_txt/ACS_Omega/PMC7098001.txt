We present a mechanochemical procedure,
with solvent-free, green-chemistry
credentials, to grow all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite.
The crystal structure of this perovskite and its correlations with
the physicochemical properties have been studied. Synchrotron X-ray
diffraction (SXRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) allowed us
to follow the crystallographic behavior from 4 to 773 K. Unreported
features like the observed negative thermal expansion of the b unit-cell parameter stem from octahedral distortions in
the 4–100 K temperature range. The mechanochemical synthesis
was designed to reduce the impact energy during the milling process,
leading to a defect-free, well-crystallized sample characterized by
a minimum unit-cell volume and octahedral tilting angles in the low-temperature
orthorhombic perovskite framework, defined in the Pbnm space group. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum shows
a reduced band gap of 2.22(3) eV, and the photocurrent characterization
in a photodetector reveals excellent properties with potential applications
of this material in optoelectronic devices.

1 Introduction
All-inorganic
cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = I, Br, and
Cl) have attracted widespread attention because
of their improved stability and balanced carrier mobility compared
with their hybrid organic–inorganic counterparts. Nevertheless,
the electrical and optical properties of these inorganic perovskites
are strongly determined by their compositions, morphologies, and crystallographic
phases.1−4

Among them, the best candidate for photovoltaic applications
is
CsPbI3, which shows a low band gap of 1.73 eV when the
cubic phase is preserved. However, bulk CsPbI3 can only
maintain the cubic perovskite structure (black phase) above ≈593
K,5 and it transforms into an orthorhombic
nonperovskite (yellow phase) material at room temperature, losing
its photovoltaic property. The addition of bromide to the halide anion
makes the black phase at room temperature more stable owing to the
increased effective tolerance factor and a lower phase-transition
temperature.1,6 However, the larger electronegativity
differences between the halogen and lead result in a more ionic bonding
character, yielding shorter bond lengths and a larger band gap. This
fact limits the short-circuit current (JSC) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) but has great potential in tandem
and semitransparent photovoltaic applications.

CsPbBr3 has attracted much interest because it possesses
a stable crystalline structure (orthorhombic phase) at room temperature
and, depending on its morphology, it can retain high carrier mobility,
good optoelectronic properties, large photoluminescence quantum yield,
and superior stability under humidity and thermal attacks. These properties
make it suitable for applications in various optoelectronic devices
such as light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, photodetectors,
and lasers.1,7−11

CsPbBr3 is usually prepared by reacting equimolar
amounts
of CsBr and PbBr2 through conventional wet procedures,
while it was described to be prepared through dry methods in only
four works. Stoumpos et al.7 and Linaburg
et al.12 used solid-state reactions (milling
and heating), while Posudievsky et al.13 and Pal et al.14 reported a mechanochemical
procedure (without further heating).

In this work, CsPbBr3 was obtained by a mechanosynthesis
procedure in a planetary ball mill at room temperature. This synthetic
process involves simplicity, swiftness, and reproducibility in line
with the green chemistry credentials (e.g., solventless solid-state
synthesis). The combination of a moderate mechanical energy generated
under mild ball-milling conditions and the inherent chemical modification
of structures/surfaces makes this methodology extremely promising
for greener perovskite syntheses, yielding well-crystallized powders
with excellent photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties.

2 Experimental Section
CsPbBr3 was obtained
as a microcrystalline powder from
mechanosynthesis in a planetary ball mill, from stoichiometric amounts
of CsBr (Strem) and PbBr2 (Alfa Aesar) processed in an
N2 atmosphere. A total of 1.5 g of the reactants was milled
using 30 zirconia balls of 5 mm diameter, with a final mass ratio
of 8.6:1, for 4 h at 400 rpm in a Retsch PM100 mill. A laboratory
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected on a Bruker D5 diffractometer
with Kα Cu (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. To study the
crystallographic structure, a neutron powder diffraction (NPD) pattern
at room temperature (298 K) was collected using the HRPT diffractometer
of the SINQ spallation source (PSI, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen,
Switzerland) with a wavelength of 1.494 Å. The crystal structure
at lower temperatures was investigated from NPD patterns sequentially
collected from 100 to 4 K in the D20 instrument (Institute Laue Langevin,
Grenoble, France) with a wavelength of 1.540 Å. The sample, contained
in a V cylinder, was introduced in a standard “orange”
cryostat and measured at 100 K for 1 h, and then cooled down to 4
K while acquiring sequential patterns every 3 min. Finally, a good
statistics pattern was collected at 4 K for 30 min. To investigate
the high-temperature structural evolution, synchrotron X-ray powder
diffraction (SXRD) patterns were collected at RT, 473, 673, and 773
K in the MSPD high-resolution diffractometer at the ALBA facility,
Barcelona (Spain), selecting an incident beam with 38 keV energy (λ
= 0.3252 Å). The high angular-resolution mode (MAD setup) was
selected.15 The polycrystalline powder
was collected in quartz capillaries of 0.7 mm diameter, which were
kept rotating during the acquisition time. In both cases, the refinement
of the structure was performed by the Rietveld method using the Fullprof
software.16,17 A pseudo-Voigt function was chosen to generate
the line shape of the diffraction peaks. The background was interpolated
between regions devoid of reflections. The following parameters were
refined in the final run: scale factor, background coefficients, zero-point
error, pseudo-Voigt corrected for asymmetry parameters, positional
coordinates, anisotropic displacement factors, and occupancy factors.
For the neutron refinements, the coherent scattering lengths for Cs,
Pb, and Br were 5.42, 9.405, and 6.795 fm, respectively. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi instrument,
model TM-1000. The optical diffuse reflectance spectrum was measured
at room temperature using a UV–vis spectrophotometer Varian
Cary 5000. The optoelectronic properties of the CsPbBr3 crystals were studied by fabricating a photodetector by drop-casting
a CsPbBr3 suspension in dimethyl sulfoxide (ratio perovskite/solvent,
1:4, weight) onto a SiO2/Si substrate with pre-patterned
gold electrodes separated by 10 μm (Ossila). The photoresponse
was analyzed by illuminating the device with different light-emitting
diode (LED) sources with wavelengths ranging from 420 to 1050 nm (1.18–2.95
eV). The light from the LED sources was focused to form a spot (400
μm in diameter) on the sample, and the intensity was adjusted
to achieve a power density of 16 mW/cm2.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Initial Characterization
CsPbBr3 was obtained as a yellowish polycrystalline
powder. The initial
crystallographic identification of CsPbBr3 was carried
out using laboratory XRPD. A Le Bail refinement, illustrated in Figure 1, shows that CsPbBr3 is pure and presents the characteristic distortion defined
in the orthorhombic symmetry, space group Pbnm. The
earliest crystal elucidations were made by XRD and NPD in the 1970s.18 Recently, several structures have been reported
using laboratory and/or synchrotron X-ray diffraction data,7,12−14,19 but there are no recent
measurements from NPD data.

prepared by ball milling.

3.2 Room-Temperature Combined Neutron and Synchrotron
X-ray Diffraction Characterization
For a precise crystal
structure resolution, both NPD and synchrotron SXRD were combined
in a joint refinement; hence, both patterns were modeled in the mentioned Pbnm space group. The Cs+ and Pb2+ cations are located at 4c (x,y,1/4) and 4b (1/2,0,0) Wyckoff sites, while Br1
and Br2 atoms are placed in 4c (x,y,1/4) and 8d (x,y,z) sites. Figure 2 illustrates the
quality of the fit for both NPD and SXRD patterns, including anisotropic
refinement of the displacement factors for all the atoms. The figure
also includes a view of the crystal structure, highlighting the tilting
of the PbBr6 octahedra. Table 1 lists the main crystallographic data. As
it is well known, the orthorhombic Pbnm crystal structure
in perovskites consists of a three-dimensional (3D) framework of corner-sharing
octahedra (PbBr6), tilted antiphase along the (100) and
(010) directions of the pseudocubic cell and in-phase along the (001)
direction, which correspond to a–a–b+Glazer’s notation as derived by Woodward for
a simple perovskite.20,21 The tilting angles, estimated
as φ = (180° – θ), where θ = ⟨Pb–Br–Pb⟩,
are 7.43 and 11.28° for the antiphase and in-phase tilts at RT,
respectively. These compare well with the values of 6.8 and 11.35°
found by Linaburg et al.12 for CsPbBr3 at RT.

3.3 Low-Temperature Neutron Diffraction Characterization
Additional NPD patterns were measured at 100 and 4 K; besides,
several patterns were sequentially collected during the cooling process.
These data reveal that the orthorhombic unit cell is maintained down
to 4 K. Figure 3 shows
the a, b, and c unit-cell parameter variation as well as the Rietveld plot at 4
K. It is remarkable that a and c parameters decrease, whereas b increases upon cooling.
This conspicuous effect of negative thermal expansion along the b-axis has not been reported before for CsPbBr3. Normally, negative thermal expansion in Pbnm perovskites
is a consequence of magnetorestrictive effects, concomitant with magnetic
ordering, for instance in rare-earth ferrites. In CsPbBr3, it deserves further analysis. Table 2 lists the main crystallographic parameters from the
pattern collected at 4 K. The Rietveld refinement and the crystallographic
data at 100 K are displayed in Figure S1 and Table S1, respectively. The octahedral tiltings at 4 K are 10.97
and 14.11° for antiphase and in-phase tilts, respectively. The
thermal evolution (including the RT and the range between 100 and
4 K) of the tilts shows a linear behavior for both phase and antiphase
octahedral rotations.

The unit-cell volume evolution is plotted in Figure 4a, which shows a
constant reduction to reach
a plateau below 20 K; this can be a compromise between the contractions
of a and c and the expansion observed
in b. A subsequent reduction is observed close to
4 K. Hence, other structural parameters such as the atomic displacement
parameters (ADPs) and interatomic distances were examined as a function
of temperature, showing that the ⟨Cs–Br⟩ distance
exhibits a monotonic contraction, while the ⟨Pb–Br⟩
distances in the PbBr6 octahedra remain unaltered within
the experimental errors (Figure 4b). This thermal evolution is reasonable considering
the greater covalent component existing between Pb–Br with
respect to Cs–Br interactions, implying that the unit-cell
volume contraction stems from the rotation of quasi-rigid octahedra.
Second, the ADPs exhibit a conventional reduction for Cs+ ions, whereas they remain almost constant for Pb2+; this
observation can be a symptom of the much more covalent Pb–Br
and rigid bond that locks the Pb displacement factors. This behavior
close to 4 K can be driven by a structural limitation in the PbBr6 octahedral framework to follow the progressive reduction
of the Cs–Br bonds, leading to octahedral distortions that
account for the expansion of parameter b.

and atomic displacement factors (b). Inset: view of the crystal structure

3.4 High-Temperature
Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction
Characterization
For the high-temperature analysis, an SXRD
experiment was performed at selected temperatures (473, 673, and 773
K). As mentioned above, the RT pattern confirms the already described
orthorhombic symmetry; however, at 473 K and above, the structure
can be defined in the cubic Pm3̅m space group. Figure 5 shows a selected angular range that illustrates this phase transition.
It is important to remark that between the orthorhombic and cubic
phases (RT to 473 K) a transient tetragonal (P4/mbm) phase has been previously reported,7,18 which we could not identify.

Figure 5 Thermal evolution of selected regions
of the SXRD patterns of CsPbBr3, in which an orthorhombic
to cubic phase transition is evidenced.

At 473 K and above, the cubic symmetry is defined in the space
group Pm3̅m. Cs atoms are
placed at 1c (1/2,1/2,1/2) Wyckoff site, Pb at 1a (0,0,0), and Br at 3d (1/2,0,0). Figure 6 plots the Rietveld
refinements at different temperatures, showing an excellent agreement
between the observed and the calculated profiles, including an inset
with a view of the cubic crystal structure above 473 K. The main crystallographic
data are listed in Table 3.

The thermal evolution
of the unit-cell parameters is illustrated
in Figure 7 as volume/Z versus temperature. On the other hand, the comparison
of the unit-cell volume with those reported in the literature reveals
significant differences, as illustrated in the inset of Figure 7. The obtained unit-cell volume
is subtly lower than those of the previous reports. Additionally,
a correlation with the synthesis method can be established. In general,
the samples synthesized from the mechanochemical (MC) method (without
heating) present a higher unit-cell volume, while those obtained from
the solid-state (SS) reaction (with heating) exhibit a smaller unit-cell
size. In contrast, our sample obtained by ball-milling exhibits the
lowest unit-cell size, which is discussed below.

Figure 7 Thermal evolution of
the normalized unit-cell volume of CsPbBr3 obtained by
ball milling compared with other literature values
from alternative synthesis techniques.

These subtle changes can be related to the defects in the crystals,
since annealing at moderate temperatures may reduce the defects in
the sample, producing quality crystals. Moreover, the sample obtained
by Stoumpos et al.7 in sealed ampoules
at 600 °C presents a smaller cell than that obtained by Linaburg
et al.12 in air at 425 °C for 20 h.
In this situation, the unit-cell size of the present sample is in
the lower limit of the analyzed samples; this fact suggests that the
present milling conditions yield a well-crystallized sample with a
minimum number of defects. In the mechanosynthesis technique, the
energy transferred to the mixture is a determining factor of the synthetic
procedure. It depends on the different characteristics of the milling
process, such as the balls/mixture mass ratio, grinding time, and
rotation speed. These determine the crystallinity and defective nature
of the perovskite structure and thus the lattice parameter and the
unit-cell volume. If we compare our milling conditions, ball:mixture
mass ratio, milling time, and rpm (8.6:1 mass ratio, 30 balls of 5
mm diameter, for 4 h at 400 rpm) with those described by Posudievsky
et al.13 (29:1 mass ratio, 30 balls of
10 mm diameter, for 4 h at 500 rpm), the latter are by far more energetic
than those used in the present work, thus leading to a more defective
material. Moreover, this can be quantified by estimating the ball-impact
energy (ΔEb) and weight-normalized
cumulative kinetic energy (Ecum). For
the conditions of the present work, the estimated ΔEb and Ecum are 4.1 mJ/impact
and 149 kJ/g, respectively. However, for Posudievsky et al.13 ΔEb and Ecum are 20.4 mJ/impact and 826 kJ/g, respectively.
The kinetic energy given to the sample per impact is approximately
5 times smaller in the present synthesis; hence, it is possible to
infer that such moderate conditions for long times yield a better-crystallized,
more defect-free sample. We have prepared, therefore, CsPbBr3 perovskite in mild milling conditions, beyond those typically used
in literature.

3.5 Microstructure by Scanning
Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
Figure 8 illustrates some typical views of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 polycrystals. From a mechanosynthesis process, involving the collision
of high-energy ZrO2 balls with the specimens, one would
expect a highly disaggregated product formed of small particles. However,
surprisingly, we can observe a heterogeneous picture where quite large
particles (10–20 μm) are mixed up with smaller fragments
of undefined shapes (Figure 8a). However, in a larger magnification picture (Figure 8b), it is evident that each
particle is indeed formed by an agglomeration of much smaller grains
of typically 0.5–1 μm. We assume that these individual
grains are monocrystalline, providing a sufficiently large diffraction
domain that accounts for the good crystallinity of the sample versus
neutron and X-ray synchrotron diffraction techniques. Altogether,
this scenario illustrates that the growth of microcrystals is not
perturbed by the dynamical motion of the reactants and ZrO2 balls after 4 h of reaction. This morphological evidence is in agreement
with that previously deduced from the synthesis conditions in terms
of ΔEb and Ecum energies.

3.6 UV–vis–NIR Spectra
The absorption
ability of CsPbBr3 powder was determined
by diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy. Figure 9 depicts the optical absorption
coefficient related to the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R) = a = (1 – R)2/2 R, R is the reflectance) versus
the wavelength in electronvolts. The band gap was calculated by extrapolating
the linear region to the abscissa. The value obtained for CsPbBr3 (∼2.22(3) eV) is in agreement with data reported in
the literature for its band gap at room temperature.6,8,9 Moreover, there is a subtle reduction
with respect to the value of 2.27 eV given by Linaburg et al.12 for a sample prepared by solid-state reactions,
which is convenient for use in solar cells.

edge.

3.7 Optoelectronic
Characterization
Figure 10a shows the time
evolution of the current flowing through the device (with a bias voltage
of 1 V applied between electrodes), while the illumination is switched
on and off. This measurement allows one to determine the photocurrent
(subtracting the current in the dark to the current upon illumination),
as well as the response time of the photodetector device. By employing
a wavelength of 420 nm, we obtain a photocurrent of 90 nA with response
times of 170 and 90 ms for the rise and decay processes, respectively.
In addition, a sizeable overshoot can be clearly seen in this figure,
which has already been observed for these materials and has been attributed
to a sudden generation of photogenerated charge carriers followed
by a slow photocurrent decay toward a steady state when the equilibrium
between the charge diffusion rate and its generation rate is achieved.22−24

Figure 10 (a) Time evolution of the current flowing through the photodetector
(bias of 1 V) under alternating dark and light illumination with different
wavelengths (power density of 16 mW/cm2). (b) Responsivity
of the device as a function of the LED wavelength (bias of 1 V and
power density of 16 mW/cm2). The inset shows the device
investigated.

To determine the spectral response
of our device, we extract the
responsivity at different illumination wavelengths. The responsivity
is a figure of merit that allows for a direct comparison between different
photodetectors. This value is defined as R = Iph/P, where Iph is the photocurrent and P the effective
power, which is given by P = Plight·Adev/Aspot, where Plight is the
LED power, Adev is the area of the material
covering the channel of the device and Aspot is the area of the spot.

Figure 10b exhibits
the responsivity as a function of the illumination wavelength. The
responsivity increases at shorter wavelengths, reaching a value of
3 A/W at 420 nm, which is higher than that reported, under similar
illumination and biasing conditions, for other perovskites like CsPbCl3 (less than 0.5 A/W) or CsPbI3 (less than 0.4 A/W).25,26 For CsPbBr3 photodetectors in the literature, the reported
responsivity ranges from ∼0.00524 to ∼10 A/W27 and thus our device
is in the upper bound of this range.

4 Conclusions
We have obtained a well-crystallized CsPbBr3 perovskite
from a mechanochemical method under mild milling conditions. The unit-cell
parameters at RT were smaller than those described for samples synthesized
by ball milling, but they were similar to those of the specimens previously
obtained from conventional solid-state reaction methods. The crystallographic
features were analyzed from synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction
in the 4–773 K temperature range. At RT, an orthorhombic superstructure
of perovskite, defined in the Pbnm space group, is
observed, which becomes cubic Pm3̅m above 473 K, in agreement with previous reports. At lower temperatures,
the phase remains orthorhombic down to 4 K, and the collapse of the
unit cell upon cooling is related to the progressive octahedral tilting;
below 8 K, the structure distortion seems to reach a limit in the
octahedral rotation. Finally, the optoelectronic properties of our
CsPbBr3 specimen, implemented in a photodetector device,
demonstrate a high and selective responsivity of 3 A/W at shorter
wavelengths, improving the reported responsivity ranges.
