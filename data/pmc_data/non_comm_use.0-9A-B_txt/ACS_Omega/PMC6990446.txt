The amphipathic interface layer sandwiched between cathode and
active layers had always played a role to balance interface compatibility
and interfacial energy barriers in inverted organic solar cell (OSC)
devices. Two functionalized amphiphilic diblock fullerene derivatives
named C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB were synthesized
and applied as an interface layer in modifying zinc oxide (ZnO). Based
on their amphipathic characteristics, the solvent treatment was introduced
to cause an obvious self-assembly of the two materials on ZnO. The
introduced cathode buffer layer could improve the interface compatibility
between ZnO and the organic active layer effectively with its amphipathic
blocks. Based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, the OSC devices
with a functionalized fullerene derivative layer could reach a power
conversion efficiency of 9.21 and 8.86% for C60-2DPE and
C60-4HTPB , respectively.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With the advantage of high electron mobility, functionalized fullerene
derivatives were one of the most used interface material in bulk heterojunction
organic solar cells (OSCs).1−15 In traditional OSC devices, the most common way of fabricating the
active layer was to control the ratio of donor and acceptor, and the
most used acceptor was a fullerene derivative.16−23 To get a high efficiency device, an interface layer (such as metal
oxide) was usually introduced to decrease the interface barrier between
the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and the organic active layer.24−32

Based on the characteristic of low work function, zinc oxide (ZnO)
was always used as a buffer layer to decrease the barrier of the cathode
electrode with an ohmic contact in inverted OSCs.33−39 However, the trap sites and defects of ZnO always required an amphiphilic
interface material to be introduced between ZnO and the active layer
to get an efficient device.40−51 The most commonly used interface material to modify ZnO was the
amphiphilic organic material, especially the functionalized amphiphilic
fullerene derivatives.52−57 Amphiphilic fullerene derivatives functionalized with polar groups
can be regarded as hydrophobic–hydrophilic diblock molecular,
in which fullerene and polar groups were the hydrophobic and hydrophilic
blocks, respectively.58−61 The introduced amphiphilic diblock fullerene derivative layer can
also guarantee the improvement of interface compatibility when introducing
to modify ZnO in OSC devices.62−64

Here, two functionalized amphiphilic diblock fullerene derivatives
named C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB were synthesized
and also applied in modifying ZnO in inverted OSCs. The OSC devices
composed of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer showed considerably
improved performance by introducing the two novel materials. The inner
fullerene derivative layer between ZnO and the active layer could
have an obvious self-assembly under the treatment of toluene, which
was also supported by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and water contact
angle measurement. Because of the multielectron transmission channels
formed by the fullerene block of functionalized fullerene derivatives
in the cathode interface layer, the inverted OSC devices based on
the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system also reached a power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of 9.21 and 8.86% for C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB, respectively, compared with that of 8.13% for bare
ZnO. The chemical structure of PC71BM, PTB7-Th, C60-2DPE, and C60-4HTPB and architecture of the inverted
OSC device are shown in Figure 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Visible Absorption
The
UV–visible absorption spectra of PC61BA, 2DPE, 4HTPB,
C60-2DPE, and C60-4HTPB are shown in Figure S1, and all of the UV absorption spectra
were obtained in solution with materials dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) with a concentration of around 0.05 mg/mL. The sharp absorption
that appeared at 316 nm in the absorption of 2DPE and 4HTPB was caused
by the conjugate structure, and the characteristic absorption peak
of PC61BA appeared at 330 and 435 nm. For C60-2DPE, the wide peak that ranged from 280 to 340 nm may be caused
by the strong intramolecular effect between PC61BA and
2DPE. For C60-4HTPB, there is also a wide peak ranging
from 318 to 380 nm. Compared with the characteristic absorption peaks
of PC61BA, 2DPE, and 4HTPB, the absorption spectra of C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB were also evident to confirm
the structure of C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB.

2.2 Morphology Characterization
As presented
in Figure 2, the surface
topographies were measured to confirm the surface morphology of three
samples. ZnO was distributed on ITO substrate uniformity with a root-mean-square
(rms) of 2.67 nm, and the smooth surface of ZnO showed the well-wetting
properties between ZnO and ITO. C60-4HTPB also formed a
uniformity layer on ZnO with an rms of 2.85 nm, which was due to their
similar hydrophilic properties. However, C60-2DPE formed
a sharp-shaped layer on ZnO with an rms of 6.60 nm, which was caused
by much aggregation of fullerene derivatives. The different surface
topographies showed the discrepancy of hydrophilic properties between
the two fullerene derivatives. When modifying ZnO, the amine-functionalized
fullerene derivative C60-2DPE aggregated in sharp shape
with high surface roughness with the evaporation of the solvent. However,
the quaternary ammonium salt-functionalized fullerene derivative C60-4HTPB formed in uniform films on ZnO with low surface roughness,
which was because of the good wetting properties with ZnO.

ITO/ZnO, (b) ITO/ZnO/C60-4HTPB, and (c) ITO/ZnO/C60-2DPF.

2.3 Self-Assembly
Based on the amphipathic
characteristics of the two fullerene derivatives, XRD and contact
angle were used to test their self-assembly after the treatment of
toluene. In this work, the samples were named thermal annealing (TA)
and solvent annealing (SA) before and after the solvent treatment,
respectively.

The diffraction peaks of the XRD spectrum can
reflect the regularity of the sample surface directly. For the ITO/ZnO
sample, it was interesting that there was a little difference between
TA and SA samples, and in both, the diffraction peaks were weak, as
presented in Figure 3a. For ITO/ZnO/C60-2DPE and ITO/ZnO/C60-4HTPB
samples, the weak diffraction peaks of TA samples located at 30°
demonstrated that fullerene derivatives on ZnO were presented in disordered
distribution. However, the intensity of diffraction peaks had an obvious
enhancement in the XRD spectrum of the two SA samples, which was caused
by the regularity of fullerene derivatives, as shown in Figure 3b,c. Based on the conjugated
rigidity and polarity difference of fullerene and conjugated fluorene
blocks, self-assembly of the two fullerene derivatives was caused
by the solvent treatment. When the two fullerene derivatives ordered
on ZnO, the counts of the tested diffraction peaks will be increased
obviously.

The photographs of water droplets on the three samples are shown
in Figure 4. The water
contact angle is an important index to represent the surface hydrophobicity,
and small water contact angle always indicated good wetting properties
between the fullerene derivatives and the ZnO layer. Water formed
in droplets with contact angles of 48, 58.5, and 56° on the surface
of three different TA samples, respectively. However, water also formed
droplets with contact angles of 48, 62.5, and 59.5° on the surface
of three different SA samples, respectively.. For the ITO/ZnO sample,
the unchanged water contact angle demonstrated that the surface hydrophobicity
can be kept unchanged under the treatment of toluene. However, the
enhancement of the water contact angle on two other SA samples with
treatment of toluene supported that the surface hydrophobicity of
the two samples have changed obviously, which was caused by the self-assembly
of fullerene derivatives under the solvent treatment.

(e) SA ITO/ZnO/C60-4HTPB, and (f) SA ITO/ZnO/C60-2DPE.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of three samples are
presented in Figure 5. For ITO/ZnO, the O 1s peaks of 529.8 and 531.0 eV (Figure 5a) were corresponded to the
Zn–O bonds and hydroxyl oxygen, respectively. For two other
samples, the new peaks (∼530.4 and 530.8 eV) appeared for C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB, respectively, which originated
from carboxyl groups (COOR). Figure 5b presented the XPS spectra of three different samples,
and the element peaks of zinc (Zn), oxygen (O), stannum (Sn), indium
(In), and carbon (C) were all measured on the surface of the ITO/ZnO
sample. In addition, the obviously enhanced C 1s peak and the newly
added nitrogen (N) peak were the characteristic peaks for ITO/ZnO/fullerene
derivatives. The XPS spectra indicated that the two fullerene derivative
layers were obtained successfully. Figure 5c shows the normalized C 1s intensity of
the three different samples, which indicated that the binding energy
of main peaks of the two fullerene derivatives were smaller than ITO/ZnO
(about 285 eV), and the intensity of the peak located at 288.6 eV
also decreased obviously with modification by fullerene derivatives.
The author thought the difference of C 1s spectra between the three
samples was ascribed to the fullerene derivative layer. Covered by
the fullerene derivative layer, the surface properties of ZnO can
be improved and the trap sites can also be decreased effectively.
The comparison of atomic concentrations between O 1s, C 1s, and Zn
2p are shown in Figure 5d. By touching the ZnO surface with its hydrophilic block, the fullerene
block ordered toward the outside direction and led to more carbon
and less oxygen results. With C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB formed in a uniform film and sharp shape on ZnO, respectively,
most ZnO was covered by fullerene derivatives, which also led to the
decrease of Zn 2p of the two modified samples.

1s spectra, (b) element spectra, (c) C 1s spectra, and (d) atomic
concentrations of O 1s, C 1s, and Zn 2p.

2.5 Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy
For the three samples, Figure 6 presented their ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
spectra, UV–vis absorption spectra, transmittance spectra,
and their energy. As presented in Figure 6a, the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) value was obtained based on eq 1 (where hν was 21.2 eV, and Ecutoff and EonsetHOMO were obtained from UPS
spectra). 1  

Figure 6 Spectra of ZnO and ZnO/fullerene derivatives: (a) UPS spectra,
(b) UV–vis absorption spectra, (c) transmittance spectra, and
(d) energy level diagrams.

As summarized in Table 1, the HOMO level energy of ITO/ZnO, ITO/ZnO/C60-2DPE, and ITO/ZnO/C60-4HTPB were −7.75, −6.94,
and −7.10 eV, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) energy levels of −4.65 eV for ITO/ZnO, −3.94
eV for ITO/ZnO/C60-2DPE, and −4.08 eV for ITO/ZnO/C60-4HTPB were obtained from their HOMO values and band gaps.
A band gap of 3.00 and 3.02 eV for the two fullerene derivatives was
obtained from their UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 6b). In Figure 6c, all three different samples showed high
transmittance in the range of 400–800 nm, while the decreased
transmittance of the samples with the modification layer may be caused
by the added ultrathin layer. The energy level diagrams of the three
samples are shown in Figure 6d, and they demonstrated that the introduction of fullerene
derivatives could reduce the work function of ZnO effectively.

2.6 Application in OSCs
Because of the
amphipathic characteristics of C60-4HTPB and C60-2DPE, two novel materials were employed as the cathode buffer layer
(CBL) in the inverted OSC device and the device with structure of
ITO/ZnO/fullerene derivatives/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The related curves are displayed in Figure 7, and the corresponding data are summarized
in Table 2. For TA
devices, the average PCE of the devices boosted sharply from 8.13%
for bare ZnO to 8.86% for ZnO/C60-4HTPB and 9.21% for ZnO/C60-2DPE. The J–V curves
of the TA devices are shown in Figure 7a. The current density (Jsc) was enhanced from 16.71 to 17.94 and 18.67 mA/cm2 for
the C60-2DPE- and C60-4HTPB-based devices, respectively.
The dark current densities of devices with TA C60-2DPE
and C60-4HTPB layers were smaller than those with bare
ZnO (showed in Figure 7c), which demonstrated that the introduced fullerene derivative layer
could inhibit the leakage current of the OSC device. The external
quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the TA devices based on ZnO, ZnO/C60-2DPE, and ZnO/C60-4HTPB are given in Figure 7e. Evidently, the
devices based on C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB ETLs
displayed better EQE values than those based on bare ZnO. For SA devices,
the PCEs of C60-2DPE- and C60-4HTPB-modified
devices were as high as 8.75 and 8.61%, respectively. The enhancement
of efficiencies should also be ascribed to Jsc, which were 17.53 and 17.51 mA/cm2 for SA C60-2DPE- and C60-4HTPB-based devices, respectively,
as presented in Figure 7b. The curves shown in Figure 7d also demonstrated that the fullerene derivative layer could
inhibit leakage current of the device. The EQE curves of devices based
on C60-4HTPB and C60-2DPE also showed better
EQE values than those based on ZnO (as presented in Figure 7f).

devices.

Compared with the device parameters of TA and SA devices based
on different CBLs, it was found that the treatment of toluene failed
to get higher PCE for OSC devices. The novel material C60-2DPE was a better choice to modify ZnO in inverted OSCs than in
C60-4HTPB, and this result of devices also matched with
the UPS measurement. It was inferred that the amine group of C60-2DPE preferred to form a hydrogen bond with ZnO, which was
greatly effective in decreasing the energy level of ZnO. The ammonium
salt group of C60-4HTPB can also form the interfacial dipole
and change the energy level of ZnO. Both the hydrogen bond and interfacial
dipole could improve the interface compatibility between the ZnO and
active layer, thus leading to more effective electronic transmission.

3 Conclusions
Two novel-functionalized amphiphilic diblock fullerene derivatives
C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB were synthesized and
applied as the modified layer on ZnO in OSC devices. Based on their
amphipathic characteristics, the solvent treatment was introduced
to cause self-assembly of the two materials and tested by XRD spectra.
When used as the interface modification material, C60-2DPE
and C60-4HTPB formed different shapes on the surface of
ZnO. The functionalized fullerene derivatives can also decrease the
energy level of ZnO and enhance the interface compatibility between
the ZnO and active layer, which could realize efficient electron transfer
from the active layer to the electrode. Device efficiencies of 9.21
and 8.86% based on the PTB7-Th:C71BM system were obtained
with introduction of C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB
without treatment of toluene, respectively, with an enhancement of
13 and 9% compared with the control device. However, all devices with
SA ZnO/fullerene derivative CBLs of C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB showed lower PCE than the devices with TA CBLs. The
results demonstrated that the solvent treatment may cause a negative
effect on the two fullerene derivatives when they were used as the
modification layer on ZnO in inverted OSCs. Comparing the synthesis
line, solubility, morphological distribution on ZnO, energy level
by modifying ZnO, device preparation, and device parameters of TA
or SA devices, the author has concluded that the functionalized amphiphilic
diblock fullerene derivative C60-2DPE was a better choice
to be an interface material modifying ZnO in inverted OSCs than C60-4HTPB, and the TA device could also get better device parameters
than the SA device.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Synthesis of Fullerene Derivatives
[6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyricacidmethylester (PC61BM) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) were purchased from Luminescence
Technology Corp and Aladdin Industrial Corp, respectively. Other reagents
and solvents used in this section were all purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent. The synthetic scheme of C60-2DPE and
C60-4HTPB is shown in Scheme 1, and the 1H NMR spectra are shown
in Figures S2–S9. The most critical
step during the synthesis of the two fullerene derivatives was the
esterification reaction. In consideration of the great diversity in
solubility of the fullerene block and functionalized fluorene block,
the esterification reaction was carried out in a mixed solvent of
ODCB and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
(in the same volume). Finally, the crude product was washed with ODCB
and methanol to remove the extra fullerene and hydrophilic-conjugated
fluorene block, respectively. The products left were the fullerene
derivatives C60-2DPE and C60-4HTPB, respectively,
which all had well solubility in DMSO. The three-dimensional (3D)
architecture of PC61BA, 2FPE, 4HTPB, C60-2DPE,
and C60-4HTPB are shown in Figure S10, which showed the conjugated main chain in conjugated amphiphilic
diblock fullerene derivatives obviously.

solvent of ODCB and DMF (in the same volume). Then, DCC (21 mg, 0.102
mmol) was dissolved in ODCB (5 mL) and added dropwise to the mixed
solution. Stirring at 0 °C for two days and at room temperature
for another day, the mixture was centrifuged at high speed in water
and ODCB. The obtained insoluble solid was put into dialysis membranes
with a molecular weight cutoff of 1000 and then into water, methanol,
ODCB, and DMSO. The DMSO fraction was kept as the product (C60-4HTPB) (25 mg, 15%) after removing the solvent.

4.2 Preparation of Films
The solvent
2-methoxyethanol (15 mL) by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.9%, 0.98 g) was
stirred at 70 °C for 1 h, and then, 2-aminoethanol (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.5%, 275 μL) was injected
into the above solution and stirred at 70 °C for another 2 h.
Finally, the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature
and stirred overnight. With ultrasonication in detergent, deionized
water, acetone, and isopropyl sequentially, the ITO substrate dried
in an oven at 80 °C overnight. The ZnO layer was formed on the
ITO substrate by spin-coating with a speed of 4000 rpm and annealing
at 220 °C after the plasma treatment. C60-2DPE and
C60-4HTPB layers were formed on ZnO with a concentration
of 2.0 mg/mL in DMSO with a speed of 1000 rpm and then annealed at
90 °C for 30 min. Finally, a part of the film was placed in the
atmosphere of toluene for 12 h to prepare SA samples.

4.3 Preparation of the Inverted OSC Device
The mixed compound of PTB7-Th:PC71BM (10 mg: 15 mg) was
dissolved in a solution of 0.97 mL dichlorobenzene and 0.03 mL 1,8-diiodooctane.67,68 The active layer was formed on three different CBLs by spin-coating
the cooled mixture solution after stirring at 60 °C for 12 h
with a speed of 1500 rpm for 60 s. Then, the MoO3 and top
Al layer with a thickness of 6 and 100 nm, respectively, were thermally
deposited in vacuum onto the active layer at a pressure of ca. 3.0
× 10–4 Pa after the active layer was placed
inverted in a glovebox for 1 h.

4.4 Instrument
For the two functionalized
amphiphilic diblock fullerene derivatives, their absorption spectra
and 1H NMR spectra were measured with an ultraviolet spectrometer
UV-3600 and Bruker AscendTM 600 MHZ. The surface topographies, UPS
spectra, XPS spectra, XRD spectra, and hydrophilicity of ITO/ZnO/fullerene
derivatives samples were tested by Veeco Nanoscope 3D, AXIS-ULTRA
DLD-600W, Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD, Empyrean and contact angle equipment
OCA20, respectively. The J–V and EQE curves of OSC devices were characterized by a Keithley 2400
source meter and Keithley 485 picoammeter.
