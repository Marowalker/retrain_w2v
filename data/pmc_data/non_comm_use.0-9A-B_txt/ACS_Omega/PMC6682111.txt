Cocrystallization may alter material
physicochemical properties;
thus, the strategy of forming a cocrystal is generally used to improve
the material performance for practical applications. In this study,
two transition-metal complex cocrystals [Zn(bpy)3]H0.5BDC·H1.5BDC·0.5bpy·3H2O (1) and [Cu2(BDC)(bpy)4]BDC·bpy·2H2O (2) have been achieved using a hydrothermal
reaction, where bpy and H2BDC represent 2,2′-bipyridine
and benzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, respectively. Cocrystals were characterized
by microanalysis, infrared spectroscopy, and UV–visible spectroscopy.
Cocrystal 1 contains five components and crystallizes
in a monoclinic space group P21/n. The H0.5BDC1.5–, H1.5BDC0.5–, and H2O molecules construct
three-dimensional H-bonding organic framework; the [Zn(bpy)3]2+ coordination cations and
uncoordinated bpy molecules reside in channels, where two coordinated
bpy ligands in [Zn(bpy)3]2+ and one uncoordinated
bpy adopt sandwich-type alignment via π···π
stacking interactions. Cocrystal 2 with four components
crystallizes in a triclinic space group P-1 to form
alternating layers; the binuclear [Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)]2+ cations and uncoordinated bpy molecules build
the cationic layers, and the BDC2– species with
disordered lattice water molecules form the anionic layers. Cocrystal 1 shows intense photoluminescence at an ambient condition
with a quantum yield of 14.96% and decay time of 0.48 ns, attributed
to the π* → π electron transition within phenyl/pyridyl
rings, and 2 exhibits magnetic behavior of an almost
isolated spin system with rather weak antiferromagnetic coupling in
the [Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)]2+ cation.

Introduction
Cocrystals, multicomponent
molecular complexes defined by Bond,1 are
at the forefront of the quest for novel crystal
forms.2 Design and synthesis of cocrystals
have gained significant interest in recent years, and this is because
that the cocrystals may alter the material physicochemical properties
and further improve the material performance for practical applications.
In pharmaceutical materials, cocrystals can enhance solubility and
dissolution by forming a crystal of drug and other benign molecule
or coformer with specific stoichiometric compositions. Meanwhile,
the cocrystallization process does not affect the chemical integrity
of molecule compounds.3−12 Pharmaceutical cocrystals, formed between an active pharmaceutical
ingredient (API) and a cocrystal precursor that is a solid under ambient
conditions, represent a new paradigm in API formulation that might
address important intellectual and physical property issues in the
context of drug development and delivery.13 In other material science, the cocrystal of two different molecules
is a possible way of intentionally influencing the position of molecules
in a crystal lattice and allows for the investigation of newly generated
macroscopic properties.14−18 It has been known that the material properties, including magnetism,19 photoluminescence,15,20−23 mechanical strength,14 etc., are modifiable
using a cocrystallization strategy, and the desired physical and chemical
properties are delivered by means of selecting a suitable cocrystal
precursor to form a cocrystal with the active compound.2

The organic cocrystals have been widely
reported hitherto,14,15,19,24−31 and in this context, the multicomponents generally have similar
molecular structures and connect together via noncovalent interactions,
such as π···π stacking and C–H···π
or H-bonding interactions. For example, a survey of the Cambridge
Structural Database32 reveals that many
cocrystal compounds of carboxylate salts contain the neutral carboxylic
acid molecules and numerous neutral pyridyl derivative residues in
the cocrystals of corresponding pyridinium derivatives. In contrast,
the cocrystals containing metal coordination compounds are infrequently
reported, and this situation is due to the fact that, commonly, the
metal complexes have different coordination modes, and the compounds
with different coordination modes rarely possess similar lattice packing
forces and exhibit similar crystallization kinetics.33−38

In this study, we have prepared two metal complex cocrystals
of
[Zn(bpy)3]H0.5BDC·H1.5BDC·0.5bpy·3H2O (1) and [Cu2(BDC)(bpy)4]BDC·bpy·2H2O (2) utilizing the
self-assembly strategy of auxiliary ligands with transition-metal
zinc(II) and copper(II) ions, respectively. We found
that the uncoordinated ligands form a cocrystal with the transition-metal
complex cations, and the H-bonding and π···π
stacking interactions play a critical role in the formation of two
metal complex cocrystals. Herein, we present the crystal structure
analyses for both 1 and 2, the solid state
photoluminescence at an ambient condition for 1 and the
magnetic property in 2–300 K for 2.

Results and Discussion
Crystal
Structures
Cocrystal 1 crystallizes
in a monoclinic space group P21/n. An asymmetry unit of 1, as shown in Figure 1, includes one coordination
cation [Zn(bpy)3]2+, one H0.5BDC1.5–, one H1.5BDC0.5–,
one half uncoordinated bpy molecule, and three lattice H2O molecules.

Figure 1 Asymmetry unit of 1 (the hydrogen atoms except
those
of the carboxylic groups are omitted for clarity, and the thermal
ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level).

The Zn2+ ion in [Zn(bpy)3]2+ shows
the distortedly octahedral coordination sphere, which is comprised
of six nitrogen atoms (labeled as N1–N6) from three bpy ligands
(Figure 2a). The bond
lengths of Zn–N range from 2.149(1) to 2.181(1) Å, and
three bite angles of N–Zn–N show the similar values
of 75.25(7)°, 76.32(7)°, and 76.49(7)°; the bond angles
of N–Zn–N in which two N atoms adopt in a trans manner
arrangement are equal to 167.99(7), 164.54(7), and 165.59(7), respectively.
These geometric parameters in [Zn(bpy)3]2+ are
comparable to those in other analogues.39−43 The uncoordinated bpy molecule shows a centrosymmetric
conformation, as shown in Figure 2b, the inversion center locates at the midpoint of
C43-C43#7 (symmetry code: #7 = 2 – x, −y, −z), and the inversion symmetry
constrains two pyridyl rings being coplanar. The partially deprotonated
H0.5BDC1.5– and H1.5BDC0.5– anions form two types of centrosymmetrical supramolecular
dimers through H-bonds. In a dimer, two monomers share one proton,
which occupies at an inversion center, and two phenyl rings are coplanar
(Figure 2c,d).

Figure 2 (a) Distorted
octahedral coordination geometry of Zn1 center, (b)
centrosymmetric bpy molecule, (c) dimer of [H(BDC)2]3–, and (d) dimer of [H3(BDC)2]− (the hydrogen atoms in both pyridyl and phenyl
rings are omitted for clarity).

As shown in Figure 3a, the neighboring [H(BDC)2]3– and [H3(BDC)2]− acidic dimers
are connected
together via strong H-bonds to form a zigzag H-bond chain along the c-axis direction, where the phenyl rings in the neighboring
[H(BDC)2]3– and [H3(BDC)2]− dimers make a dihedral angle of 69.6°.
Besides the strong H-bonds between different acidic dimers as well
as within each type of acidic dimer, as displayed in Figure 3b, the strong O–H···O
H-bond interactions also appear between different water molecules
and between water molecules and each of two types of acidic dimers
in which the typical distances between the atoms of the H-bond donor
and acceptor (O···O), as listed in Table 1, fall in the ranges of 2.801(3)–2.856(3)
Å. As shown in Table 1, the H-bond parameters in 1 are comparable to
those in other O–H···O bond systems.44−46

The zigzag H-bond chains
formed by two types of acidic dimers are
further developed into a 3D H-bonding organic framework (HOF) through
the H-bonding interactions between lattice water molecules and two
types of acidic dimers, and the HOF shows channels along the b-axis direction, which is illustrated in Figure 3c. Both [Zn(bpy)3]2+ coordination cations and lattice bpy molecules are
accommodated in the channels (Figure 3d). As shown in Figure 3e, each uncoordinated bpy molecule is sandwiched between
two bpy molecules from two neighboring [Zn(bpy)3]2+ coordination cations, with a mean plane distance of 2.981 Å
between the neighboring bpy rings and a closest interatomic distance
of 2.868 Å. Obviously, the five different components cocrystallized
in 1 are due to multiple strong H-bonding47,48 and π···π stacking interactions.49,50

Cocrystal 2 belongs to a triclinic space group P-1, and its asymmetric unit consists of one binuclear Cu2+ coordination cation, one disordered BDC2–, one lattice bpy molecule, and two heavily disordered lattice water
molecules, forming a cocrystal with a 1:1:1:2 stoichiometry, which
is shown in Figure 4a. Two crystallographically inequivalent Cu2+ ions in
the binuclear unit show a distorted square pyramid coordination sphere,
as displayed in Figure 4b, and each coordination square pyramid is comprised of four N atoms
from two different bpy ligands and one O atom from one BDC2– ligand, where each carboxylate adopts the monodentate binding manner
in the BDC2– ligand. The Cu–N distances range
from 1.975(2) to 2.177(2) Å, and the Cu–O bonds show the
distances of Cu1–O1 = 1.991(2) Å and Cu2–O3 = 2.029(2)
Å. These bond lengths are similar to those reported in the literature.51−54 It is worth noting that two different types of metal coordination
cations [Zn(bpy)3]2+ and [Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)]2+ appear in 1 and 2, respectively, although almost the same reaction conditions were
used for preparation of them. The formation of distinct metal coordination
cations in 1 and 2 may be relevant to two
reasons: (1) the bpy is a chelating ligand, and the entropy effect
promotes the Zn2+/Cu2+ ion to easily form the
species of the metal ion with bpy compared to carboxylate using a
monodentate binding manner and (2) the Cu2+ ion favors
to form quadrilateral or square pyramidal coordination geometry owing
to the Jahn–Teller effect arising from its electron configuration
of d9.

Figure 4 (a) Asymmetry unit (all hydrogen atoms are omitted for
clarity,
and the thermal ellipsoids are drawn at the 50% probability level)
and (b) distorted coordination square pyramids of two crystallographically
different Cu2+ ions in the crystal structure of 2.

In the crystal of 2, the uncoordinated bpy molecule
and deprotonated BDC2– coexist in the lattice, and
the bpy molecule shows a transoid conformation, which is similar to
that in 1. One carboxylate shows disordered, and the
oxygen atoms have two possible positions (Figure 4a).

As shown in Figure 5a, 2 shows lamellar packing
fashion, and the layers
are parallel to the crystallographic (0 1 –1) plane. The anionic
layer contains the deprotonated BDC2– ions and heavily
disordered lattice water molecules (removed in the refined crystal
structure, see Figure S3), and the cationic
layer is comprised of binuclear [Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)]2+ units and uncoordinated bpy molecules. As displayed in Figure 5b,c, in a cationic
layer, the uncoordinated and coordinated bpy molecules form a ladder-like
motif in a manner of ···(coordinated bpy)2(uncoordinated bpy)··· along the b + c direction, where the bpy molecules act as the
rungs of a ladder and interact with each other via π···π
interactions. The mean plane of molecules between the neighboring
uncoordinated bpy and coordinated bpy molecules shows a distance of
3.493/3.657/3.405/3.523 Å, and the closest interatomic distance
is 3.268/3.288/3.323/3.329 Å. The mean plane of molecules between
the neighboring coordinated bpy molecules shows a distance of 3.429/3.433
Å, and the shortest interatomic distance is 3.382/3.380 Å.
These distances fall within the typical separation range of π···π
interactions. In addition, two neighboring coordinated bpy molecules
show the π···π interaction along the a + b + c direction (Figure 5b,d) with a mean
plane distance of 3.354/3.496 Å and a shortest interatomic separation
of 3.292/3.476 Å.

bpy molecules along the a + b + c direction.

PXRD, UV–Vis Absorption Spectra of 1 and 2, and Photoluminescence Spectrum of 1
The synthesized and simulated PXRD patterns are shown in Figure S4 for 1 and 2, respectively. The well-matched synthesized and simulated PXRD patterns
indicate the high phase purity of the crystalline samples.

UV–vis
spectra of cocrystals 1 and 2 in the solid
state are shown in Figure 6a. Two compounds show similar ultraviolet spectra in a region
of 250–400 nm, with two intense absorption bands located at
∼287 and 285 nm and three shoulders; these absorption bands
correspond to the π → π* electron transitions within
the aromatic rings, including the pyridyl rings in bpy and phenyl
rings in BDC species.52,55 Cocrystals 1 and 2 display different spectra in the visible spectral regime
(400–800 nm). Cocrystal 2 exhibits a broad absorption
band spanning from 550 to 800 nm, attributed to the d–d electron
transition in the Cu2+ ion. In the spectrum of 1, there is no sizable absorption in a spectral regime of 400–800
nm, this is because that the Zn2+ ion has d10 electron configuration, and no d–d transition is possible.
The solid-state excitation and emission spectra of 1 were
investigated at an ambient condition. Cocrystal 1 was
irradiated by ultraviolet light with λex = 335 nm,
giving rise to an emission band with the maximum λem = 368 nm (Figure 6b), which is attributed to the π* → π transitions
within the aromatic rings. A similar emission band was also observed
in other compounds containing [Zn(bpy)3]2+ coordination
cations.56,57 The quantum yield of 1 was
determined to be 14.96% under an ambient condition, and the curves
of fluorescence decay are shown for 1 in Figure S5. The process of fluorescence decay
follows a single exponential decay law. The best fit of the time-dependent
fluorescence intensity to eq 1 led to a fluorescence lifetime τ of 0.48 ns, which
falls within the nanosecond range and shows fluorescence character. 1

Magnetic Property of 2
Temperature-dependent magnetic
susceptibility is shown in Figure 7a, where χm denotes the molar magnetic
susceptibility of 2 with two Cu2+ ions per
formula unit, and the diamagnetism was not subtracted from χm. The plot of χm–T shows the typical Curie–Weiss magnetic behavior; thus, first,
the Curie–Weiss law was used for the fit of temperature-dependent
magnetic susceptibility data, 2  In eq 2, C and θ represent
the Curie and Weiss constants, respectively, and χ0 denotes the temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility term,
including the diamagnetism and possible van Vleck paramagnetism. The
best fit gave the parameters of C = 0.773 emu·K·mol–1, θ = −0.35 K, and χ0 = −1.8 × 10–6 emu·mol–1. The fitted Curie constant is slightly larger than a spin-only value
of 0.75 emu·K·mol–1 for two uncoupled S = 1/2 spins with g = 2.0. Too small θ
value indicates that the magnetic coupling is quite weak between the
neighboring magnetic centers, and this result is in agreement with
the crystal structure analysis (refer to the Crystal
Structures description section). Next, the Bleaney–Bowers
equation was further used for the magnetic susceptibility fit to estimate
the magnetic coupling interaction within a dimer. The function of
molar magnetic susceptibility against temperature is expressed in eq 3 (Bleaney–Bowers
equation) for an S = 1/2 spin dimer, which is deduced
from the spin Hamiltonian H = −2JS1S2. 3  In eq 3, the symbols of N, g, μB, and J have normal meanings, and then, the total experimental
magnetic susceptibility follows the eq 4, 4  In eq 4, the symbol χ0 represents
the temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility and is fixed using
the value obtained from the fit by eq 2. The best fit using eq 3 and eq 4 produced a g of 2.02 and J of
−0.52 K. The g factor value is quite reasonable
for the Cu2+ ion, and the small negative J value also indicates the existence of weak AFM coupling interaction
within a dimer. The corresponding χm(dimer)T versus T is plotted in Figure 7b, which also shows the presence
of weak antiferromagnetic interaction within the dimer of Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)2+.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have achieved two novel cocrystal compounds, which
contain correspondingly Zn2+/Cu2+ coordination
cations with the uncoordinated ligands, using a hydrothermal reaction.
In cocrystal 1, the partially deprotonated H2BDC dimers of [H(BDC)2]3– and [H3(BDC)2]− form 3D HOF with channels,
and the [Zn(bpy)3]2+ cations together the uncoordinated
bpy reside in channels; there are strong π···π
stacking interactions between the uncoordinated and coordinated bpy
molecules and between the coordinated bpy molecules. Cocrystal 2 shows the layered structure with alternating anionic and
cationic layers, the dimers of Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)2+ are comprised of the cationic layers together with the uncoordinated
bpy molecules, and the BDC2– ions are consistent
of anionic layers together with heavily disordered water molecules.
The formation of cocrystals 1 and 2 is attributed
to the strong H-bonding and π···π stacking
interactions between multicomponents. Cocrystal 1 emits
intense photoluminescence in the solid state at an ambient condition
with a quantum yield of 14.96% and decay time of 0.48 ns, assigned
to the π–π* electron transition within the aromatic
rings, and 2 shows the magnetic characterization of an
almost isolated magnetic system with rather weak antiferromagnetic
coupling in the Cu2(bpy)4(BDC)2+ dimer.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Physical Measurements
Chemicals, including
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, H2BDC, and bpy, and
all solvents were commercially purchased and directly used without
further purification.

Elemental analyses (EA) for carbon, hydrogen,
and nitrogen were performed on a PerkinElmer CHN-2400 elemental analyzer.
Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded in the wavenumber ranges of 400–4000
cm–1 on an AVATAR-360 spectrophotometer using KBr
pellets. The UV–vis spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer
Lambda 950 UV–vis spectrometer. The 1H NMR spectra
were recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Bruker 400
MHz. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with an Edinburgh
Instruments FLS920P fluorescence spectrometer at room temperature.
The emission decay lifetime and quantum yield were recorded at room
temperature in an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer. Magnetic
susceptibility was measured for the polycrystalline sample in the
temperature ranges of 2–300 K using a Quantum Design MPMS-5S
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer,
and the diamagnetism arising from the core of atoms was not removed
from the experimental magnetic susceptibility.

Preparation and Characterization
of 1 and 2
Preparation of [Zn(bpy)3]H0.5BDC·H1.5BDC·0.5bpy·3H2O (1)
A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.15 g, 0.50 mmol), H2BDC (0.17 g, 1.0 mmol), bpy (0.080
g, 0.50 mmol), and NaOH (0.060 g, 1.5 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL
of distilled water. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, sealed in a
23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated at 170 °C
for 3 days, and then slowly cooled to ambient temperature. The solutions
were filtered, and the filtration was allowed to slowly evaporate
solvent. Pink crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray structure
analysis were obtained after 3 days and dried in air yielding 0.025
g (∼50% yield calculated using the reactant Zn(NO3)2·6H2O). Anal. calcd for C51H44N7O11Zn (Mr = 996.32): C, 61.43, H, 4.45, and N, 9.84%. Found: C, 60.97,
H, 4.54, and N, 9.63%. IR spectrum (KBr disc, cm–1): 3419(m, br), 3076(m), 1698(s), 1605(m), 1562(m), 1474(m), 1442(m),
775(s), and 736(s). 1H NMR data (400 MHz, DMSO, 25 °C,
TMS, δ): =7.47–8.70(m, 38H, Hpheyl-ring and Hpyrid-ring).

Preparation of [Cu2(BDC)(bpy)4]BDC·bpy·2H2O (2)
This cocrystal compound was prepared
using the similar procedure to that of 1, instead of
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O by Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.18 g, 0.75 mmol). Dark green
crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray structure analysis were
obtained after 3 days and dried in air yielding 0.20 g (65% yield
calculated using the reactant Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) of 2. Anal. calcd for C66H52Cu2N10O10 (Mr = 1272.26): C, 62.30, H, 4.12, and N, 11.01%. Found:
C, 61.99, H, 4.52, and N, 11.63%. IR spectrum (KBr disc, cm–1): 3431(m, br), 3074(m), 1606(s), 1560(m), 1473(m), 1444(m),765(s),
and 718(s).

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction
data of 1 and 2 were collected on a Siemens
SMART-CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromatic Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). The structures were solved by direct methods
and refined on F2 using full-matrix least-squares
methods with SHELXTL package.58 All nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms were theoretically
added, riding on their parent atoms.

It is worth mentioning
that two heavily disordered and diffused outer-sphere water molecules
were found in the structure of 2, which were removed
by the program SQUEEZE in Platon during the structural refinements.59

Crystallographic data and structural refinement
details of 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 2. Selected bond lengths
and angles are tabulated
in the Supporting Information (Table S1). The Diamond 3.1 program was used for the creation of figures and
analysis of hydrogen bonding interactions in the crystal lattice.60
