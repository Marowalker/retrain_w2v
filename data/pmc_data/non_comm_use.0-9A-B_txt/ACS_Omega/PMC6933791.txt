In recent years, cardiac glycosides (CGs) have been investigated
as potential antiviral and anticancer drugs. Digitoxigenin (DIG) and
other CGs have been shown to bind and inhibit Na+/K+-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase). Tumor cells show a higher
expression rate of the Na+/K+-ATPase protein
or a stronger affinity towards the binding of CGs and are therefore
more prone to CGs than non-tumor cells. Cancer imaging techniques
using radiotracers targeted at specific receptors have yielded successful
results. Technetium-99m (99mTc) is one of the radionuclides
of choice to radiolabel pharmaceuticals because of its favorable physical
and chemical properties along with reasonable costs. Herein, we describe
a new Na+/K+-ATPase targeting radiotracer consisting
of digitoxigenin and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), a
bifunctional chelating ligand used to prepare 99mTc-labeled
complexes, and its evaluation as an imaging probe. We report the synthesis
and characterization of the radiolabeled compound including stability
tests, blood clearance, and biodistribution in healthy mice. Additionally,
we investigated the binding of the compound to A549 human non-small-cell
lung cancer cells and the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by the labeled compound in vitro. The 99mTc-labeled
DTPA–digitoxigenin (99mTc-DTPA–DIG) compound
displayed high stability in vitro and in vivo, a fast renal excretion,
and a specific binding towards A549 cancer cells in comparison to
non-tumor cells. Therefore, 99mTc-DTPA–DIG could
potentially be used for non-invasive visualization of tumor lesions
by means of scintigraphic imaging.

Introduction
Lung cancer is considered to be one of
the most aggressive tumors
with a very low survival rate; therefore, patients would benefit from
early diagnosis and treatment.1 Nuclear
medicine and radionuclides are valid strategies for early cancer detection
since they detect physiological changes in the target tissue. Other
imaging methods, such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic
resonance imaging, are especially able to identify morphological changes.2

Cardiac glycosides (CGs), including cardenolides,
are natural products
used for treating cardiac insufficiency in humans, as they bind to
and inhibit Na+/K+-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase)
in the myocardium, resulting in an increased cardiac output by enhancing
the force of contraction. The Na+/K+-ATPase
is a ubiquitously expressed P-type heteromeric integral membrane protein
complex of eukaryotic cells, which actively transports three sodium
and two potassium ions across the cell membrane using adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP) hydrolysis as the driving force.3,4 It consists
of three subunits—a catalytic α subunit, a stabilizing
and activity-modulating β subunit, and a regulatory γ
subunit, also known as an auxiliary FXYD2 protein.4,5

Mutations and altered expression of Na+/K+-ATPase(s)
have been linked to several diseases, like Alzheimer’s
disease, diabetes mellitus, or the growth of cancer cells. Cancer-promoting
effects seem to correspond with mutations and differences in expression
rates of the α- and β-subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase.6 Different relative expressions
of Na+/K+-ATPase subunits further influence
the susceptibility and binding affinity to specific cardenolides.4 Lately based on the before-mentioned results,
new therapeutic applications, besides the use of cardenolides to treat
congestive heart failure, for various other diseases, e.g., viral
infection or ischemic stroke, have been described.7,8  Recent
studies have further reported an increased susceptibility of
cancer cells to cardenolides (reviewed in refs (9−11)) and their antiviral activity.7,12,13 It has been shown that several cancer cell
lines, including the A549 non-small-cell lung cancer cell line, overexpress
Na+/K+-ATPase proteins on their membrane, especially
the α-subunit, on which cardenolides like digitoxigenin (DIG)
bind with high affinity.11,14,15 For that reason, radiolabeled DIG may be an interesting probe to
identify and localize tumors or even to monitor tumor extent.

Technetium-99m (99mTc) has often been used to label
radiopharmaceuticals, due to its suitable physical and chemical properties,
along with reasonable radionuclide cost.16 Several chelating agents are currently used to prepare stable complexes
with 99mTc, including diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
(DTPA), which requires mild labeling conditions and fast reaction
rates at room temperature. This is an important characteristic of
thermosensitive compounds since they may be degraded during the labeling
process.

The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the
new compound 99mTc-DTPA–digitoxigenin (99mTc-DTPA–DIG)
as a tumor-targeting probe. To achieve this aim, DTPA–digitoxigenin
(DTPA–DIG) was synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), NMR, and mass spectrometry (MS). Subsequently, the
radiolabeling efficiency and stability were examined, and in vitro
cell binding in the A549 lung cancer cell line compared to the MRC-5
non-tumor cell line was studied. Additionally, biodistribution was
monitored and scintigraphic images were taken in healthy mice to estimate
the pharmacokinetics of the new probe.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structural Analysis of DTPA–DIG
The reaction was carried out in different solvents ranking from dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to pyridine and tetrahydrofuran, to improve the product
yield (Table S1). Product formation was
only observed in DMSO due to the good solubility of the educts in
this solvent (Figure 1). The isolation of the product DTPA–DIG from the reaction
medium was challenging, since it has four free carboxyl groups and
an ester linkage prone to hydrolysis at either high or low pH values.
DTPA–DIG was isolated and purified by preparative reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) employing mild conditions
(Figure S1). Fractions containing the product
were pooled, and acetonitrile (ACN) was removed by evaporation under
reduced pressure. In the sequence, the residual water was eliminated
by lyophilization to afford DTPA–DIG as a white amorphous solid
(61% yield on molar base). The infrared spectrum of DTPA–DIG
showed a carboxylic acid O–H stretch at 3200–2500 cm–1; an alkyl C–H stretch at 2936–2860
cm–1; C=O stretches at 1712, 1778, and 1733
cm–1, respectively, of carboxylic acid, lactone
and ester as well as a C–O strong stretch at 1213 cm–1. This last band demonstrates the presence of an ester linkage in
DTPA–DIG (Figure S2). MS spectra
were acquired for the protonated molecular ion MH+ at m/z 750.6 compatible with the chemical
formula of C37H55N3O13 from the monoester DTPA–DIG (Figure S3). The 1H NMR spectrum of DTPA–DIG showed the methylene
protons of the DTPA group at the interval δ 2.82–3.63
and all protons of the aglycone digitoxigenin (Figures 1 and S4, and Table 1). The assignment
of the resonance signals was confirmed by data from the heteronuclear
single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum. Two doublets centered at
δ 4.98 and 4.88 (d, J21a,21b = 17.5
Hz) were ascribed to the geminal coupling of the methylene protons
at C-21. The C-3 methine proton resonates at δ 5.03, a downfield
shifted-value in comparison to H3α of the free aglycone, due
to the ester linkage with the DTPA group (Figures S4 and S5a,b). The HSQC spectrum was very useful to determine
the 1H/13C one-bond shift correlations of all
hydrogen-bearing carbon atoms in DTPA–DIG. Complete 1H/13C one-bond shift correlations of all protonated carbon
atoms are presented in Table 1 (Figure S5a,b). The 1H–1H correlated spectroscopy (COSY) spectrum was
useful for assigning the hydrogen resonances of DTPA–DIG (Figure S6a–c). The C-3 methine proton
(δ 5.03) showed cross-peaks with the methylene hydrogens linked
to C-2 (δ 1.50 and 1.61) and C-4 (δ 1.33 and 1.94), whereas
the C-17 methine proton (δ 2.73) exhibited correlation spots
with C-16 methylene protons (δ 2.05 and 1.81) (Figure S6). The 13C NMR spectrum of DTPA–DIG
showed the resonance signals of 37 atoms (Table 1 and Figure S7), which were identified as two methyl, nineteen methylene, and six
methine carbon atoms by the distortionless enhancement by polarization
transfer (DEPT)-135 experiment (Figure S8), along with ten quaternary carbons. The signals at δ 176.3
and 174.0 were ascribed, respectively, to C-20 and C-23 of the α,β-unsaturated
lactone ring. The carbonyls at C-8′, C-10′, and C-14′
resonate with the same chemical shift value, at δ 172.5, while
the signals at δ 170.4 and 169.8 were ascribed to C1′
and C-12′ carbonyls (DTPA group), respectively. The downfield
chemical shift values of C-3, C-14, and C-21 were due to the presence
of geminal oxygen functionalities on these carbon atoms. The heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiment was useful for the assignments
presented in Table 1 (Figure S9a–f). Nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) data, coupling constants, and comparison
with literature records17 were used to
distinguish the diastereotopic protons within the methylene groups,
which exhibited characteristic patterns for axially or equatorially
located hydrogens (Table 1). Hence, NOESY depicted spatial interactions between the
C-3 methine proton (δ 5.03) and C-2′ methylene (δ
3.53) hydrogens. These NOESY observations indicated that C-3 oxygen
was bonded to C-1′ through an ester linkage (Figure S10a–c). The presence of a single ester bond
in the compound DTPA–DIG was also supported by 1H, 13C, mass spectral, and infrared data,17 as discussed above.

99mTc Labeling of DTPA–DIG, Radiochemical
Purity, and in Vitro Stability
DTPA–DIG was radiolabeled
with 99mTc in the presence of stannous chloride (SnCl2) as a reducing agent. To evaluate the effect of the reducing
agent on the labeling process, three different amounts of the reagent
(200, 270, 330 μg) were tested, and the radiochemical purities
were determined.

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) over silica
gel was used to determine the radiochemical yield of the 99mTc-DTPA–DIG, employing two distinct eluent systems (acetone
or glacial acetic acid/water 15:85, v/v). The radiolabeling reaction
can yield 99mTcO4– and 99mTcO2. 99mTcO4– migrated with the solvent front in both TLC systems, glacial acetic
acid/water (15:85, v/v) and acetone (Rf = 0.9–1.0), whereas the radiocolloids (99mTcO2) remained immobilized at the point of application in both
solvents (Rf = 0.0). 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
showed Rf values of 0.9 or 0.0 in glacial
acetic acid/water (15:85, v/v) or in acetone as eluents. High radiochemical
yields play a crucial role in radiopharmaceutical applications since
the presence of radiochemical impurities has to be limited as they
cause images of low quality and they might also accumulate in the
thyroid and stomach as well as in the liver and spleen.2 Ideally, radiopharmaceuticals should be at least
90% pure, in terms of radioactivity species.18 The use of 200 μg of stannous chloride in the labeling reaction
afforded a suitable overall radiolabeling yield (95.8 ± 2.2%),
whereas amounts of 270 and 330 μg led to a product with insufficient
purity (68.7 ± 7.2 and 77.1 ± 6.6%, respectively). The success
of radiolabeled DTPA–DIG was further evidenced by ultraperformance
liquid chromatography (UPLC)/MS analysis, where the 99mTc-labeled compound gave signals in the negative ion mode at m/z 820 [99mTc-DTPA–DIG
– CO2 + H2O – H]−, m/z 864 [99mTc-DTPA–DIG
+ H2O – H]−, and m/z 883 [99mTc-DTPA–DIG + 2H2O – H]− (Figure S11).

The stability of the labeled conjugate is also
pivotal for the
successful application of a radiopharmaceutical.19 Aiming for an in vivo administration of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG,
its radiochemical stability was evaluated using the two distinct solvent
systems (acetone or glacial acetic acid/water 15:85, v/v) mentioned
above at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h in the presence of NaCl 0.9% (w/v) solution
at room temperature (23 °C) or in the presence of plasma at 37
°C, under agitation. In both conditions, the product including
the ester bond remained stable within the evaluated interval (Figure 2). If the isotope
chelation of radiodiagnostic agents does not remain stable for several
hours, the biodistribution and imaging data will be unreliable.20

Figure 2 Radiochemical stability of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
in
saline (0.9% NaCl) at room temperature (23 °C) and plasma at
37 °C. Radiochemical stability was tested up to 24 h (n = 6).

Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase Activity by 99mTc-DTPA–DIG and Specific Binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG towards MRC-5 and A549 Cells
In a first
step, the inhibition rate of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG against
Na+/K+-ATPase activity (mixture of α1,2,3
subunit from the porcine cortex) was evaluated at 0.1 μM, a
concentration corresponding to the IC50 value of the labeled
compound against A549 cells (IC50 A549 cell line: 0.12
μM; IC50 non-tumor MRC-5 cell line: 0.78 μM; Figure S12). Inhibition of porcine Na+/K+-ATPase (α1,2,3 subunit) was investigated to
assay the effect of the labeling solution, free DTPA, and the labeling
of DTPA–DIG on the Na+/K+-ATPase activity
in general (Figure 3). The obtained data showed that neither the reagents in the labeling
solution nor DTPA alone has any effect on Na+/K+-ATPase activity. However, concentrations of 0.1 μM of DIG,
DTPA–DIG, and 99mTc-DTPA–DIG reduced the
enzymatic activity to less than 50%. This indicated that neither DTPA
nor 99mTc interfered with the binding of DIG to the Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit and that the interaction
between the cardenolide derivative and its target structure remains
intact. This is an important and positive result for assessing the
suitability of the radiolabeled compound as a potential imaging probe.

Figure 3 Inhibition
of Na+/K+-ATPase activity by DIG,
DTPA, DTPA–DIG, and 99mTc-DTPA–DIG tested
at 0.1 μM. Effects of DIG, DTPA–DIG, and 99mTc-DTPA–DIG on Na+/K+-ATPase activity
were assayed with the Na+/K+-ATPase α1,2,3
subunit of the porcine cortex. Results indicated Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition by DIG, DTPA–DIG, and 99mTc-DTPA–DIG. However, labeling solution, as well as DTPA
alone, has no influence on the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase.

Cancer drug development is currently focused on
the search of specific
biochemical differences between malignant and normal cells, a strategy
that is also adopted in the development of diagnostic tools for the
identification of tumor cells. Na+/K+-ATPase
is known to be the target receptor for CGs.21 This ubiquitous enzyme belongs to the P-type ATPase family and is
involved as an integral membrane protein in transporting sodium ions
out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, thus helping regulate
the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane.22 Human Na+/K+-ATPase is
composed of four different isoforms of the α-subunit, acting
as the catalytic subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase
complex (α1, α2, α3, and α4). Additionally,
three different β-subunit isoforms and seven γ-subunit
isoforms result in great protein viability.23 The overall expression pattern of the Na+/K+-ATPase is a possible biomarker for cancer, as a high expression
level of the α-subunit and a low expression of the β-subunit
may indicate an increased risk for cancer.6 Keeping in mind that Na+/K+-ATPase is a specific
target for CGs and the different expression rates of its subunits
in malignant to non-malignant cells, the protein constitutes a potential
target to identify tumors or to monitor tumor mass and growth.

Cardiac glycosides including cardenolides and their derivatives
are known to bind to the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, impairing the attachment of ATP and thus disrupting
the effect of the enzyme.24 Depending on
the concentration and structure of CGs, either the Na+/K+-ATPase can be inhibited or the Na+/K+-ATPase signalosome can be activated, both inhibiting cell proliferation
and impeding cell survival.6,25 An overexpression of
the α1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase was
observed in human non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cell lines.26 The authors demonstrated26 that A549 cells, overexpressing the α1 subunit of
the Na+/K+ ATPase, are more susceptible to selected
cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin, ouabain, and the hemisynthetic
derivative of 2″-oxovoruscharin (UNBS1450). The specific binding
of cardenolides to the overexpressed α1 subunit of A549 cells
is a promising and unique feature that led us to select this cell
line for an in vitro binding study.

Therefore, the specific
binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
to the human non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cell line versus the
non-tumor human fetal lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line was evaluated
by quantifying the overall radioactivity level. The concentration
of 0.1 μM was also used for examining the cellular binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG to the A549 cancer cells and the non-tumor
human fetal lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells. The in vitro results showed
a significantly higher binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
to A549 cells than to non-tumor MRC-5 cells. 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
binding to A549 cells was reduced to the rate of non-tumor MRC-5 cells
when it was co-incubated with a 10-fold excess of free digitoxigenin
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 Binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG to MRC-5 non-tumor
lung cell lines and to A549 lung cancer cell lines after 2 h of incubation. 99mTc-DTPA–DIG showed significantly higher affinity
to A549 lung cancer cell lines. Specific binding was significantly
reduced by 10-fold blocking with free DIG. Results are expressed as
a mean ± standard error (n = 3).

The outcomes from these experiments, i.e., the
high specific binding
of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG to A549 cancer cells, low affinity
of 99mTc-DTPA to A549 cancer cells, and the inhibition
of the Na+/K+-ATPase by 99mTc-DTPA–DIG,
let us conclude that the higher specificity of DIG for the lung cancer
cell line A549 results from an increase in the expression of the Na+/K+-ATPase. The selectivity of DIG towards the
A549 cell line compared with other cancer cell lines has been previously
described in cytotoxicity studies.27,28 A higher expression
of the Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit was reported
for A549 cell lines.26 . In the same direction,
an increased expression of certain subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase was found in bladder and gastric cancer cells.29,30 An alteration in the overall Na+/K+-ATPase
activity was further described in renal carcinoma cells4 along with an increased expression of the α1
subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase in the majority of
glioblastomas, in comparison to normal brain cells.31 In light of this higher expression rate of the Na+/K+-ATPase and the specific binding of cardenolides to
their α subunit, developing imaging probes that are based on
the cardenolide structure seems to be a promising strategy for tumor
identification. Therefore, investigating the specific binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG or 99mTc-DTPA coupled to different
cardenolides or cardenolide derivatives towards various cancer cell
lines can be a valid and prospective strategy to evaluate their potential
for tumor diagnosis. However, in a first step for gaining more information
on this newly synthesized and labeled compound 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
and its suitability as an imaging probe, biodistribution as well as
blood clearance has to be studied in healthy mice.

Blood Clearance, Biodistribution, and Scintigraphic Images in
Healthy Mice
The radiolabeled complex showed rapid blood
clearance, with only 0.51 %ID/g at 0.5 h and a further decrease at
2 h (Table 2). Its
half-life was 11.7 min (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Blood clearance of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG in healthy
mice (n = 6).

Fast blood clearance is favorable for early imaging
as background
radiation can lower imaging quality.20 Biodistribution
studies were conducted in healthy mice, and tissues were analyzed
at 0.5 and 2 h post-injection. Maximum uptake was observed in the
liver and intestine. The kidneys also showed a high uptake, suggesting
that  renal elimination also contributes to the radiopharmaceutical’s
excretion (Table 2 and Figure S13).

A relatively low uptake in
the thyroid was observed, indicating
high stability of the labeled complex.32 The distribution in healthy mice was further analyzed by images.
High uptake rates in the kidneys, liver and mainly in the intestine
could be detected (Figure S13). Comparable
low accumulation of the labeled compound in the heart of healthy mice
can be due to the fact that rodents have a mutation in the α1
subunit of their Na+/K+-ATPase, which makes
them less susceptible to CGs. For example, Ujvari and co-workers showed
that as a consequence of this mutation, the Na+/K+-ATPase in rodents is 1000-fold more resistant to the cardenolide
ouabain.33 Additionally, cardiac α
isoform expression varies depending on the species. So far, the α3
subunit, which also has a high binding affinity to CGs, has been only
identified in humans, but not in rodents.34 Therefore, the altered distribution of the isoforms in rodents might
also be an explanation for the low accumulation of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
in the mice heart.

In the 1960s, the use of radiolabeled CGs
made it possible to detect
cardiac glycosides and their metabolites in body fluids and tissues.
Studies with tritiated digoxin showed that its clearance from the
human body depends on renal excretion.35 Pharmacokinetic studies with digoxin in humans evidenced its main
adsorption into the intestine, kidneys and heart and a major renal
excretion.36 Likewise, the administration
of the 99mTc-labeled ouabagenin–cysteine conjugate
to guinea pig, rabbit and rat also showed fast blood clearance and
renal elimination. For rabbits and rats, an additional high uptake
in the liver was also observed.37 CGs aglycones
like ouabagenin and digitoxigenin exhibit a reversible binding to
Na+/K+-ATPase, whereas the binding of CGs bearing
sugar moiety is irreversible and exhibits a different pharmacokinetics
behavior.38 Without sugar moieties present,
the molecules dissociated in the bloodstream much faster.36 This was further supported by the findings of
ref (39), which demonstrated
that 125I-digoxin-iodohistamine(bis(O-carboxymethyloxime))
exhibits selective myocardial accumulation in guinea pigs compared
with the 125I-digoxigenin-iodohistamine(3-oxime) and 125I-digoxigenin-iodohistamine(3-ester). Like other imaging
probes already described, e.g., by de Barros and co-workers,299mTc-DTPA–DIG showed a fast
blood clearance and a renal excretion. Therefore, its possible use
as an imaging probe is thereby further strengthened.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the compound DTPA–DIG
was successfully synthesized,
characterized, and labeled with technetium-99m, showing a high level
of stability. In vitro binding assays confirmed a higher and specific
affinity of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG to non-small-cell lung
cancer A549 cells in comparison to human fetal lung fibroblast MRC-5
cells, probably due to the specific binding of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
to the target Na+/K+-ATPase. Neither the labeling
solution nor DTPA inhibited significantly the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. 99mTc-DTPA–DIG blood levels
decline fast, which allows obtaining early images. In addition, biodistribution
and scintigraphic studies showed a high uptake by the intestine, liver
and kidney. Taken together, the results reported here demonstrate
the specificity of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG to lung cancer
cells and suggest that this new radiolabeled derivative might be potentially
useful for imaging techniques applied to diagnoses of tumors and other
diseases that show distinct expression rates of the Na+ /K+-ATPase.

Material and Methods
Material
99mTc was acquired from a 99Mo/99m Tc generator supplied by Instituto de Pesquisas
Energéticas e Nucleares—IPEN (São Paulo, Brazil).
Other reagents and solvents for the radiolabeling procedure were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (São Paulo, Brazil). The human non-small-cell
lung cancer A549 cell line (ATCC CCL-185) was obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Human fetal lung fibroblast
cells (MRC-5) were acquired from the European Collection of Cell Cultures
(ECACC, Porton Down, WI, England). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Gibco, Waltham, MA) was used for cell cultivation supplemented
with fetal bovine serum (FBS) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (São
Paulo, Brazil). Antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Trypsin was acquired from Invitrogen
(São Paulo, Brazil), and matrigel was obtained from Becton,
Dickinson and Company-BD (Juiz de Fora, Brazil). Female BALB/c mice
(15–20 g) were purchased from the central vivarium at Universidade
Federal de Minas Gerais. Animals were kept under specific pathogen-free
(SPF) conditions, with free access to food and water. The cages were
temperature-controlled with filtered air and a regulated light–dark
cycle (12:12 h). All protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee
for Animal Experiments at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (protocol
number 424/2014) and are in compliance with the guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals recommended by the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources.

Synthesis of the DTPA–DIG Compound
The reaction
was performed in a preparative scale with DMSO as the solvent. First,
110 mg of digitoxigenin (0.29 mmol), 550 mg of DTPA dianhydride (1.54
mmol), and 27.5 mg of DMAP (0.22 mmol), used as the catalyst, were
added to a cylindrical tube (13.5 × 3.5 cm2). Then,
5.5 mL of DMSO was added, and the reaction mixture was heated to 65
± 2 °C under calcium chloride protection by using a drying
tube to create a water-free environment. The mixture was stirred for
8 h. Next, the reaction mixture was maintained for 48 h at 8 °C
and then subjected to purification procedures.

Isolation of DTPA–DIG by Semipreparative RP-HPLC
DTPA–DIG was isolated by semipreparative RP-HPLC using a Shimadzu
equipment (Shimadzu Corp., Japan) composed of wo LC6AD pumps and a
manual injection valve (Rheodyne 7125, Rheodyne, CO). The injection
was performed using a 1.000 μL sample loop, and detection was
carried out at 200 and 220 nm, employing a dual-wavelength detector
(SPD M10A) controlled by LCsolution software v.1.25 (Shimadzu Corp.).
Separation was performed on an ODS column (Shim-pack PREP-ODS; 250
× 4.6 mm2 i.d., 5 μm), using a linear gradient
of 10–100% ACN with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) for elution in 20
min, at a flow rate of 7 mL/min. The obtained peak fractions were
pooled, and the acetonitrile was removed in a rotary evaporator at
30 °C, followed by lyophilization to eliminate the water.

Infrared Spectroscopy
The IR spectrum was recorded
on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One spectrometer (Beaconsfield, U.K.) with
an attenuated total reflection (ATR) system.

NMR Analysis
1H NMR, 13C NMR,
DEPT-135, 1H–1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and
NOESY spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer (1H 400 MHz and 13C 100 MHz) in DMSO-d6 at 300 K with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal
standard for both nuclei. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm
and J couplings in hertz (Hz).

Radiolabeling and Radiochemical Purity of DTPA–DIG with
Technetium-99m
First, 1 mg of the DTPA–DIG (1.3 nmol)
was dissolved in 20 μL of DMSO and diluted with 380 μL
of saline. Then, 100 μL of a 1 mg/mL solution of stannous chloride
(in HCl 0.25 M), as a reducing agent, was added. The pH of the solution
was adjusted to 7 with a NaOH solution (140 μL of 0.1 M), and
the vial was immediately vacuum-sealed. Pertechnetate (99mTcO4–) was added (∼3 mCi), and
the mixture was allowed to react for 15 min at room temperature (23
°C). The radiolabeling yields of the 99mTc-DTPA–DIG
were determined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis on two
solvent systems: acetone to determine 99mTcO4– and glacial acetic acid/water (15:85) to
determine 99mTcO2. The radioactivity of centered
cut TLCs was measured using an automatic scintillation counter.

An additional staining with Kedde’s reagent was carried out
for proving the stability of the DTPA–DIG by detection of the
lactone ring after radiolabeling.

UPLC/MS Analysis of Radiolabeling
UPLC/MS analyses
were carried out on an ACQUITY Ultra Performance LC system (Waters,
Milford, MA) linked simultaneously to a photodiode array detector
(PDA) 2996 photodiode array detector (Waters, Milford, MA) and an
ACQUITY TQ Detector (Waters MS Technologies, Manchester, U.K.), equipped
with a Z-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in positive
and negative modes. MassLynx software (version 4.1, Waters, Milford,
MA) was used to control the instruments, as well as for data acquisition
and processing. Diluted sample solutions (3 μL; 0.5 mg/mL; 0.58
nmol) were injected into a reversed-phase column (BEHC18, 1.7 μm, 1 × 50 mm2, Waters, Milford, MA),
which was maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of
solvent A (H2O/0.1 HCOOH) and solvent B (acetonitrile/0.1
HCOOH) at a flow rate of 300 μL/min, eluted in a linear gradient,
as follows: T = 0 min, 5% B; T =
10 min, 95% B; T = 11 min, 5% B; T = 13 min, 5% B. The effluent was introduced into a PDA detector
(scanning range 210–400 nm, resolution 1.2 nm) and subsequently
into an electrospray source (source block temperature 120 °C,
desolvation temperature 350 °C, capillary voltage 3.5 kV, cone
voltage 30 V) and nitrogen as the desolvation gas (600 L/h). Mass
chromatograms were recorded in the positive and negative ionization
modes.

In Vitro Stability
Radiochemical stability was evaluated
in saline at room temperature and in plasma at 37 °C, under agitation,
from samples taken 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation at room temperature
(23 °C). Radiochemical stability was determined by TLC as described
above. The radioactivity was measured using an automatic scintillation
counter. The number of samples per each time point was 6, and they
were evaluated in duplicates.

Binding of the Radiolabeled Compound towards MRC-5 and A549
Cell Lines
Cell Culture
Human non-small-cell lung cancer (A549)
and human fetal lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin
and streptomycin as antibiotics. Cells were maintained in a humidified
incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells
were grown to confluence and then harvested by trypsin dissociation.
After centrifugation (500g for 5 min), cells were
resuspended with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4).
Viable cells for the binding assays were quantified using trypan blue
staining, and cell number was countered in a Neubauer Chamber.

Cell Viability
The colorimetric MTT assay was performed
using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT). Cells (1 × 104 A549 and MRC-5 cells per well
of a 96-well microtiter plate) were cultured for 48 h with various
concentrations of 99mTc-DTPA–DIG. At the indicated
time points, MTT was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, and
200 μL of DMSO was added after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C
to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at
570 nm using a plate spectrophotometer (VersaMax ELISA Microplate
Reader, Molecular Devices). Cells treated with 0.5% DMSO served as
a negative control to define 100% viability. The percentage of viable
cells was plotted against the sample concentration, and the IC50 values were determined based on the dose–response
curves using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA).

Na+/K+-ATPase Assay
Enzymatic
activities of the Na+/K+-ATPase α1,2,3
subunit of the porcine cortex (Sigma) were assayed using 4 mM ATP
as the substrate in a final volume of 40 μL assay buffer containing
40 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), and 8 mM MgAc2. The negative control was assayed
without enzyme, and 4 mM ATP was added after 30 min of incubation
at room temperature. The positive control contained 0.05 U/mL Na+/K+-ATPase α1,2,3 subunits of the porcine
cortex in a 30 min preincubated mixture with assay buffer; later,
4 mM ATP was added. Inhibition assays were performed by co-incubating
the enzyme and individual inhibitor at concentrations of 0.1 μM
for 30 min and adding 4 mM ATP solution. Reactions were stopped after
30 min of incubation, and activity was determined by measuring the
Pi released according to the malachite-green test40 Activity was scored as the percentage of reduction of absorbance
subtracting the absorbance at 600 nm of the control well, relative
to the positive control well. Positive control defined 100% enzyme
activity. All experiments were performed in triplicates.

Binding Studies
For the binding assay, 0.1 μM
of the 99mTc-DTPA–DIG, 1.3 μM of 99mTc-DTPA, and 99mTc-DTPA–DIG with excess (10-times)
of free digitoxigenin were incubated at 37 °C with 250 000
viable cells/tube. This mixture was kept under agitation (140 rpm)
for 120 min. Next, the material was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was
resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and analyzed in an automatic scintillation
counter. The experiment was performed in independent biological triplicates
each consisting of three technical replicates.

In Vivo Studies in Healthy Mice
Blood Clearance
Aliquots of 100 μL (3.7 MBq)
of the diluted 99mTc-DTPA–DIG (final volume 1800
μL) were administrated to healthy BALB/c female mice (20 g,
8 weeks old, n = 6, per time point) through the tail
vein and blood samples were extracted 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240
min after administration. Each sample was weighted, and the associated
radioactivity was determined. The percentage of injected dose per
milliliter of blood (%ID/mL) was determined, and the data were plotted
as a function of time.

Biodistribution
Aliquots of 100 μL (3.7 MBq)
of the diluted 99mTc-DTPA–DIG (final volume 1800
μL) were injected intravenously into healthy BALB/c mice (20
g, 8 weeks old, n = 6, six per time point). After
30 min or 2 h, mice were anesthetized (ketamine: 80 mg/kg; xylazine:
15 mg/kg) and euthanatized. Blood, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lungs,
muscle, thyroid, and intestine were removed, dried on filter paper,
and placed in preweighed plastic test tubes. The radioactivity was
measured. A standard dosage containing the same injected amount was
counted simultaneously in a separate tube, which was defined as 100%
radioactivity. The results were expressed as the percentage of injected
dose/g of tissue (%ID/g).

Scintigraphic Images
First, 100 μL aliquots (18
MBq) of the diluted 99mTc-DTPA–DIG (dilution to
final volume 3600 μL) were injected intravenously into the tail
vein of healthy BALB/c mice (20 g, 8 weeks old, n = 6 per time point). After 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, mice were anesthetized
(ketamine: 80 mg/kg; xylazine: 15 mg/kg) and placed horizontally under
the collimator of a low-energy high-resolution γ camera (Mediso,
Hungary). Images were acquired using a 256 × 256 × 16 matrix
size with a 20% energy window set at 140 keV for a period of 300 s.

Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean
± standard deviation of the mean. Means between the various groups
were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
post hoc test). In the case of multiple comparisons, a post hoc Bonferroni
correction was applied. P values <0.001 were considered
statistically significant. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
5 Software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).
