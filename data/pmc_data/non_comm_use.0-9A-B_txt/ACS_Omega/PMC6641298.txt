Flexible,
semitransparent ionic liquid gel (ionogels) film was
first fabricated by in situ polymerization. The optimized ionogels
exhibited excellent mechanical properties, high conductivity, and
force sensing characteristics. The multifunctional sensor based on
the ionogel film was constructed and provided the high sensitivity
of 15.4 kPa–1 and wide detection range sensing from
5 Pa to 5 kPa. Moreover, the aforementioned sensor demonstrated excellent
mechanical stability against repeated external deformations (for 3000
cycles under 90° bending). Importantly, the sensor showed advantages
in detection of environmental changes to the external stimulus of
subtle signals, including a rubber blower blowing the sensor, gently
touching, torsion, and bending.

Introduction
Pressure sensors have
been of great interest in Internet of things
applications,1−3 including smart windows, displays, security system,
mobile phones, and prospective electronic skin.4−8 Among various aspects of pressure sensors, it is
necessary to develop excellent flexibility, high sensitivity, and
a wide-range sensing,9−11 which are significantly important to detect human
activities.12 Hence, enormous efforts are
being paid to fabricate the sensors with high sensitivity and excellent
flexibility. The piezoresistive sensors inserting the micro/nanopatterns
were used to improve the sensitivity, and fabricating the nanostructure-based
hybrid films in sensing layers to mend the flexibility has been developed.
Despite the great progress achieved so far, the aforementioned methods
are still limited in extensibility, high cost, and poor durability,
thus restricting their application in wearable sensors.

Ionic
conductors13 are a class of functional
materials with key roles in energy storage, solar energy conversion
sensors,14−17 and electronic devices. One important kind of ionic conductor is
hydrogels18 containing electrolytes, which
offer a unique combination of high stretchability, transparency, and
biocompatibility. They have showed great promise as stretchable ionic
devices, such as electrically activated, soft, transparent actuators19 and ionic skins sensing the location and pressure
of touch. However, the poor electromechanical stability of aqueous
electrolytes limits their further application in wearable electronics.
Comparably, the ionogels20 represent an
important sensing material including the polymer composites with ionic
liquids (ILs), which possess the attributes of the solid and the liquid:
the polymer network provides an elastic solid form that avoided the
drawbacks of IL leakage, and the ILs enable electrical conduction.
Thus, the ionogels have been developed intensely in wearable electrical
fields, in particular in E-skin devices.21,22 It is worth noting that the nonconductive polymer in the ionogels
sometimes affects the conductivity of the ionogels, thus limiting
the sensitivity.23 Despite the great progress
in the ionogel-based E-skin achieved so far, the development of a
highly sensitive ionogel-based pressure sensor with multifunction
remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation of materials
and engineering.

Herein, air-stable, highly conductive, semitransparent
ionogels
were fabricated by in situ synthesizing 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium
dicynamide ([VEIm][DCA]) ILs containing a carbon–carbon double
bond.23,24 The effects of the components of ionogels
on its properties such as flexibility, conductivity, and transparence
were investigated. The optimized ionogel-based sensors exhibited excellent
mechanical properties, high conductivity, and force sensing characteristics.
Importantly, the aforementioned pressure sensor provides high sensitivity
of 15.4 kPa–1, little hysteresis, and a wide detection
range, which had potential application in monitoring the external
stimulus of subtle signals and human activities.

Results and Discussion
The chemical structures of the materials and preparation process
of the ionogels were schematically illustrated in Figure 1a and 1b, respectively. The detailed descriptions of the ionogel fabrication
process were presented in the Experimental Section. In brief, the N,N′-methylene
bis(acrylamide) (NNMBA) and ammonium persulfate (APS) were first dissolved
in 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium dicynamide ([VEIm][DCA]) ILs to form
the prepolymer solution, and then the solution was heated at 80 °C
in a vacuum oven. After heating for 2 h, the colorless solution would
change into the ionogels with the orange color, as shown in Figure 1c.

mechanism of the ionogels. (c) The photographs of the mixed solution
before the polymerization and the ionogels.

The effects of the ionogel components on its properties,
especially
for the film morphology, color, transmittance, and conductivity, were
investigated in detail. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1, the proportions of NNMBA and APS on ionogels had significant effects
on the morphology and the color. When the ratio of NNMBA/APS was more
than 1:1 in the mixture of 2 mL of ILs with 25 mg of APS, significant
cracks occurred, which might be attributed to the coexistence of multiple
phases due to nonreactive NNMBA.25−27 With the decrease of
the ratio of NNMBA, the surface of the gel film became smooth, and
the color changed from light black to brown. At 1:1 ratio of NNMBA/APS,
the orange gel film with smooth surface could be obtained (Figure 2a and 2b). With the further decrease of the ratio, the ionogels cannot
be formed due to lack of polymerization. In addition, the content
of the APS had obvious effects on the film morphology and transparency.
As shown in Figure 2c, some cracks occurred again, and the gel color becomes deeper from
brown to black, which reduced the transmittance of the gel film when
there was an increase of APS in the mixed solution with 2 mL of ILs
and 25 mg of NNMBA. Figure 2d presented a photograph of the outside view of the laboratory
through the ionogel film. It was obvious that a semitransparent film
was formed. The composites of the ionogels were investigated by the
EDX and FT-IR spectra, and the results were shown in Figure S2 and Figure S3. It was obviously seen that the new
peak was observed at the 1750 cm–1 in the FT-IR
after reaction. Moreover, the EDX element analysis spectrum exhibited
only C, N, and O peaks without the S peak. These results further confirmed
that the ionogels were formed, including of the ILs and the NNMBA
without the APS. In addition, the ionogels also obtained good thermostability,
which also depended on the composite of the ionogels. As shown in Figure S4, there was a two-step weight loss process
as the temperature rose from room temperature at 10 °C/min. The
first region of the ionic gel polymer appeared from 120 to 230 °C,
where the heat loss of the ionogels with NNMBA/APS of 1:1 was minimum
corresponding to 6–12% weight loss only. With the further increase
of the temperature, the heat loss increased dramatically which had
reached 44–47% at about 450 °C. Moreover, the sharp endothermic
peaks appeared in the DSC thermogram of the ionogels with varied ratios
of NNMBA/APS corresponding to melting temperature Tm of ∼260 °C, together with a crystallization Tc of ∼250 °C and a decomposition
temperature Td of ∼330 °C
(shown in Figure S5). Moreover, the intensity
of the exothermic peak gradually decreased with increasing of the
ratio of NNMBA/APS in the ionogels. Therefore, under the above optimized
condition, the NNMBA, APS, and ILs were completely reacted, avoiding
the phase separation, resulting in higher transparency, smooth surface,
and better stability.

ionogel
films fabricated at different ratios of NNMBA and APS where the ionic
liquid was 2 mL and the APS was 25 mg. (c) ESEM images of ionogel

liquid was 2 mL, and the NNMBA was 25 mg. (d) Photograph of the ionogel
film fabricated at 1:1 of NNMBA and APS. The laboratory outside view
was taken as the background.

Moreover, it was found that the composite of gel had an obvious
effect on the flexibility and conductivity except the transparency
and morphology. It was seen that the device based on ionogels fabricated
on the 1:1 showed the better flexibility. Furthermore, the aforementioned
film also showed the high conductivity as described from Figure 3a and 3b, which might provide a promise in the high sensitive pressure
sensor. Based on the above description, the ionogels with 1:1 ratio
of NNMBA/APS showed the higher transparency and conductivity and better
morphology and flexibility. Therefore, the composition comprised of
25 mg of NNMBA, 25 mg of APS, and 2 mL of ILs was used as the optimal
composite for the following sensing investigation.

High sensitivity was necessary to detect the subtle pressure
signal,
which was important for both fundamental research and practical applications.
To investigate the sensitivity, the typical sensor was constructed
on the optimized ionogels. The device structure was schematically
illustrated in Figure 4a, where the size of the ionogels was 15 × 7 × 0.4 mm,
and a detailed fabrication process was shown in the Experimental Section. The sensitivity of the sensor could
be defined as S = δ(ΔI/I0)/δP, where
ΔI, that is I – I0, was the relative current change when a certain
pressure was applied on the devices; I0 was the pristine current of the device under no pressure; and P was the applied pressure. Figure 4b showed the sensitivity of a pressure based
on ionogel film. Similar to most of the reported pressure sensors,
the plot for sensitivity was composed of different regions. Generally,
in the low-pressure regime, the sensor obtained the higher sensitivity,
while in the high-pressure regime, the sensor had lower sensitivity.
The sensitivity was approximately 0.45 kPa–1 in
the region of more than 30 Pa and was 6.21 kPa–1 in the range of 4 Pa ∼ 25 Pa, at the bias voltage of 4 V.
In addition, the sensitivity increased with the bias voltage, which
could arrive to 15.4 kPa–1 at the bias voltage of
10 V as shown in Figure S4. The dependence
of the sensitivity on the voltage might be attributed to the Schottky
barrier between the ionogel film and the electrodes.

bias voltage of 4 V. (c) The comparable results of the reported literature
and this work. This work (★), the results based on the ionogels
(●), and other results (▼). (d) The relative current
change under different light materials.

The hysteresis behavior of the sensor was also investigated
during
loading and unloading pressure cycles and shown in Figure 4b. The loading and the unloading
curves were almost overlapped, indicating little hysteresis existed.
Moreover, the degree of hysteresis was calculated as follows28  where ALoading and AUnloading were the area of loading
and unloading curves, respectively. A lower DH value indicated lesser
hysteresis in the electrical response. The DH value of the obtained
sensor was only 5.36%. The above result further confirmed that the
sensor based on ionogels was capable of detecting pressure quantitatively
and independently of the pressure history. Despite the facile fabrication
process, the sensitivity based on the ionogel film can be comparable
to or higher than most of the reported results in the literature28−39 as shown in Figure 4c. Compared to these sensors based on the ionogels, the aforementioned
sensor had higher sensitivity than that of the capacitive pressure
sensor based on ionogel film with the flat structure.22 In addition, the sensor possessed the detection limit of
5 Pa, which could be comparable to the most reported microstructure
ionogel film.22,24,40−46 The above excellent performances may be attributed to the adhesion
between ionogels and the Eco-Flex elastomeric soft matrix, which caused
surface self-wrinkling of ion gels, resulting in the excellent force
sensitivity of the sensor. As we know, the response current signals
would be larger for high conductive pressure sensors, and thus very
small applied pressure would be able to produce the detectable signals.
Therefore, the high conductivity of ionogels and good contact between
the conductive layer and electrode should be the main factors resulting
in the high sensitivity.

Importantly, the sensor showed fast
response when the 5 Pa pressure
was loaded on the surface, demonstrating a similar response with the
fast response and high sensitivity (shown in Figure 4d). Moreover, the sensor also showed obvious
response to a small leaf (5.5 Pa) and light flower flake (4.6 Pa).
The ionogel-based sensor possessed a high sensitivity and a low detection
limit simultaneously, exhibiting potential applications for the protection
of some precision instruments and a potential Hazard Alarm System.
The pressure sensing mechanism of the sensor based on the ionogels
was similar to the hydrogel and ionic nanofabric materials.47,48 Under subtle external pressure, the ionogel structure experienced
compression with an increase of the high-density mobile ions, resulting
in higher electrical conductivity.

A highly sensitive pressure
sensor based on ionogel film allows
us to efficiently detect a wide range of pressures in a single-device
platform. Here, we monitored the relative resistance or current changes
arising from a variety of pressure sources including minute pressure
of leaf and light flower (∼5 Pa), low pressure of rubber blowing,
and generally touching (<10 kPa). The results in Figure 5 showed that the sensor was
capable of accurately detecting the various pressures describe above.
Specially, the sensor showed high sensitivity and fast response to
the touching. A gentle touch by a human hand (9 mN) was bigger than
natural perturbation of breeze by swinging a feather (0.009 mN).50 When a finger gently touched the sensor surface,
the resistance of ionogels immediately fluctuated with external loading
and unloading. Moreover, the response signal had a sharp peak instead
of a state curve, which illustrated a fast response and no hysteresis
with the fast switching (Figure 5a). The touching and releasing time were 0.072 s and
0.753 s, respectively, which was far better than the reported results.
The excellent features in touching sensing would enrich the application
of the sensor in a robot touching sensor. Furthermore, the sensors
could detect the noncontact actions such as air movement generated
by human respiration. As shown in Figure 5b and Figure S5, notable peaks were seen when a man breathed toward the device and
a rubber blower blew the surface of the device. During detection,
the absence of direct contact action acted as a medium for transmitting
the action triggers to the pressure sensor. The intensity of the signal
peaks corresponded to weak and strong air movement, where the air
movement was similar to loading to about 60 Pa pressure on the surface.
The noncontact pressure sensors based on ionogels were expected to
react to potential applications in many new fields such as turbulent
flow detection, vibration monitoring, and an acoustic transducer and
so on.

current variations when breathing toward the device at the bias voltage

To explore the potential application in the flexible electrics,
the bending property of the obtained pressure sensor was investigated.
First, the ionogel-based sensor was integrated on the PET substrate.
The sensor inherited superb flexibility of the PET upholder, and the
bending angle was defined in the inset of Figure 6a. Even with the minute bending of 1°,
an obvious relative resistance change was obtained, which corresponded
to 0.05% bending strain,49 We harnessed
the bending-induced strain on the upper surface of the PET slab as
a stimulus to the sensor, which in turn reflected the bending extent. Figure 6a showed the relative
resistance change from 0° to 15°, which was enough to illustrate
that the sensor had a very keen response to the smaller deformation
and, under 90° bending, also showed a stable and lasting response
(Figure 6b). Even with
the minute bending of 1°, an obvious relative resistance change
was obtained. As we know, the electrical stability was an important
factor in application of the pressure sensor. The response and restoration
curves of the sensor measured for 3000 cycles under 90° bending
were shown in Figure 6c. The output signals of the relative resistance change were stable,
indicating the remarkable electrical stability. As aforementioned,
this robust response was associated with the stable ionogels and good
contact between the ionogel film and the electrodes. In addition,
the sensor was sensitive to torsion stimulus and showed relatively
stable resistance changes under the torsion loading and unloading
(Figure 6d), where
twisting degree was defined similar to the reported literature.50 The outstanding properties in bending or torsion
sensing enabled the sensor to the application of monitoring joint
bending of humans and robots. Importantly, this work would have a
profound influence on the synthesis and device assembly of the next
new ionogels, especially the design and construction of an ultrasensitive
ionogel-based pressure sensor with various functions (bending, twisting,
pressure, friction, stretching, and pulse). Most importantly, it would
be used to monitor or capture the human body real-time signal in the
smart wearable equipment and perceive a slight change in the surrounding
environment.

Conclusions
Flexible
and semitransparent ionogels were constructed by in situ
synthesizing [VEIm][DCA] containing a carbon–carbon double
bond. The ionogels exhibited highly conductive and force-sensing characteristics.
The optimized ionogel-based sensor demonstrated high sensitivity of
15.4 kPa–1, little hysteresis of 5.36%, and a low
detection limit of 5 Pa and thus was extremely sensitive to ambient
environmental changes including of weak gas flow, small leaf, flake
flower, and gentle touching. Moreover, the sensor exhibited excellent
mechanical stability against repeated external deformations (3000
cycles under 90° bending). Importantly, the optimized sensor
showed multifunctional sensing characteristics including the pressure,
bending, and twisting. The excellent performance and facile process
suggested the potential application of the ionogel-based sensor in
the detection of the interaction of human and robot and detection
of the environment change.

Experimental Section
Materials
Polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS-184) was purchased
from Dow Corning Corporation Midiand-Michigan USA. Eco-flex 0030 was
purchased from SMOOTH-ON. N,N′-Methylene
bis(acrylamide) (NNMBA), ammonium persulfate (APS), and 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium
dicynamide ([VEIm][DCA]) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,
Shanghai, China. This IL with 99% purity was used directly without
further purification.

Ionogel Preparation
NNMBA and APS
were dissolved in
2 mL of [VEIm][DCA] ILs, and then the mixture was vigorously stirred
for 30 min to form the solution. The mixed solution was heated at
80 °C in a vacuumed oven. After heating for 2 h, the colorless
solution became the ionogels.

Sensor Fabrication
First the PDMS prepolymer mixed
solution was first spin-coated on the clean silicon wafer at 350 rpm
and heated at 80 °C for 2 h. The solidified PMDS film was cut
into slices as a mold in the following process. Second, the mixture
of Eco-flex was poured on the PDMS mold surface and solidified in
a Petri dish. The Eco-flex film was peeled off, and PDMS mold was
removed, forming the small channel with the size of length of 15 mm,
width of 7 mm, and the height of 0.4 mm. Then the mixed solution was
filled in the small channel with copper foils attached as electrodes
at both ends and polymerized at 80 °C for 2 h. To enhance the
contact of the ionogel film and the Eco-flex substrate, another two
Eco-flex films were sealed on both ends of the devices, and the mixture
solution of Eco-flex was poured on the surface of the covered film.
After solidification of the Eco-flex, the sensor based on the ionogels
was obtained.

Characterization
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed in air using
a TG/DTA6200 (Seiko Inc., Japan). The samples were heated from room
temperature to 500 °C at 10 °C/min. The morphology of the
ionogels was analyzed with an environment scanning electron microscope
(ESEM, Quanta FEG250) and the reflection detection microscope (CMM-90AE).
The composition of the ionogels was measured by Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR, Thermo Fisher Scientific FTIR 6700) and the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Electrical properties were measured using
semiconductor meter Keithley4200.
