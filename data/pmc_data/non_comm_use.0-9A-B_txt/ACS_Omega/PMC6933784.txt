In this work, a novel thermoresponsive switching transistor
is
developed through the rational design of active materials based on
the typical field-effect transistor (FET) device configuration, where
the active material is composed of a blend of a thermal expansion
polymer and a polymeric semiconductor. Herein, polyethylene (PE) is
employed as the thermal expansion polymer because of its high volume
expansion coefficient near its melting point (90–130 °C),
which similarly corresponds to the overheating point that would cause
damage or cause fire in the devices. It is revealed that owing to
the thermistor property of PE, the FET characteristics of the derived
device will be largely decreased at high temperatures (100–120
°C). It is because the high volume expansion of PE at such high
temperature (near its Tm) effectively
increases the distance of the crystalline domains of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
to result in a great inhibition of current. Besides, the performance
of this device will recover back to its original value after cooling
from 120 to 30 °C owing to the volume contraction of PE. The
reversible FET characteristics with temperature manifest the good
thermal sensitivity of the PE-based device. Our results demonstrate
a facile and promising approach for the development of next-generation
overheating shutdown switches for electrical circuits.

1 Introduction
Over the past decade,
electronic devices have become important
elementary units for developing diverse consuming electronics in our
society. During the operation of electronic devices, heat loss will
inevitably occur and heat will be the main byproduct. In some cases,
the electrical devices in the circuits, especially for the integrated
electronics such as cell phones, vehicles, and so forth could be overheated
because of waste heat generated from the short circuit, spark gap,
or poor heat dissipation.1 Such overheated
devices have aroused a serious concern because they might associate
with major damage such as fire, explosion, and injury. For this reason,
the commercial devices are usually equipped with two elements combining
the functions of a temperature sensor and circuit breaker; however,
it may cause obstacles in working response or complicate the device
design. Thus, research attention has been recently increased to seek
more simple and effective methods to limit these shortages.1

Based on this requirement, we are particularly
interested in developing
a transistor switch, the most basic element in an electronic circuit
that can enable rapid shutdown at abnormal temperature. Among the
developed transistors, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have
gained considerable research interest because of the advantages of
low cost, light weight, low power consumption, facile integration
capability, and simple structure design. Thus, OFETs have been employed
for widespread applications, for example, signal switching and amplification
in modern electronic devices.2−9 More recently, numerous efforts have been even devoted to the development
of stimuli-responsive OFETs that are responsive to physical,10−12 chemical,13,14 or biological stimuli.15 Generally, the strategy to realize the sensing
functions of OFETs relies on the rational designs of active channel
materials, electrodes, and gate dielectric layers. For example, a
high-performance pressure sensor device was fabricated with high sensitivity
and response times by directly incorporating microstructured plasma
desorption mass spectrometry films into the dielectric layer of an
OFET device.11 Another study of phototransistors
consisting of the blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT)
and TiO2 nanoparticles as the active layer has been demonstrated
to show stable electrical performance and fast response to light illumination.12 However, to the best of our knowledge, thermoresponsive
OFETs for applications in overheating-circuit protection have been
rarely investigated.

In this study, we describe a new approach
to realize a thermoresponsive
switching OFET through the rational design of active material, for
which the active channel consists of a blend of a thermal expansion
polymer and a polymeric semiconductor. Herein, polyethylene (PE) is
chosen as the thermal expansion polymer because of its significant
volume expansion property near the melting point (90–130 °C),
which similarly corresponds to the overheating point that would cause
damage in the devices or would cause fire arising from the exposure
of integrated electronic components to the high-temperature internal
fluids (such as oil and coolant). Meanwhile, P3HT is selected as the
model semiconducting material. We interestingly manifest that the
blended PE can effectively increase the distance of packing motif
between the conducting domains as temperature increases, thereby restricting
the output current at a relatively high temperature.16,17 Therefore, the direct performance-temperature dependence of our
fabricated OFET devices is examined upon the heating and cooling of
external temperature (ranging from 30 to 120 °C). We have also
investigated the morphology of the active layers upon temperature
variation by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence
wide-angle X-ray scattering to correlate the structure–performance
relationship. The results revealed in this work present a proof-of-concept
device that can be easily integrated into the electronic circuits
to serve as an overheating controller.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Safety Circuit Device Design Using a Thermal
Expansion Polymer
An ideal thermoresponsive switching transistor
device should be based on the typical transistor device because it
is capable to be easily integrated into the circuit as the switched-mode
power supply unit. When a large amount of heat (>100 °C) is
accumulated
in the connected circuits, the output current of the thermoresponsive
transistor will be largely decreased to serve as an overheating controller.
Basically, the current flow into an OFET device can be modulated by
the semiconductor/dielectric interface, thereby controlling the ON/OFF
states of the device. Based on this principle, we herein design a
thermoresponsive transistor device through a rational design of the
active channel materials. The typical P3HT is herein employed as the
model semiconducting material and is further blended with PE that
possesses a high thermal expansion coefficient, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Device configuration
of the studied thermoresponsive switching
OFET and the structures of the studied polymers for the active channel.

As summarized in Table 1, PE possesses a unique feature in response
to the temperature
change, which is suitable to realize the thermoresponsive function.
PE exhibits a large thermal expansion coefficient of 3.8 to 8.6 ×
10–4 m/(m·K), which is ∼10 times greater
than the value of P3HT and polystyrene (PS). This makes PE possess
a significant volume expansion near its melting point (∼90
°C). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves for the
pristine P3HT, PE, and the P3HT/PE blends are presented in Figure S1. As seen, the P3HT/PE blends show a Tm of ∼90 °C and a Tc of ∼77 °C, which is similar to the neat
PE, indicating that the phase transition of the P3HT/PE blends mainly
depends on the thermal expansion of PE. Such large volume expansion
upon increasing temperature thus could inhibit the current flow between
the source and drain electrodes owing to the insulating nature of
PE. Besides, because the volume expansion or contraction of PE is
highly dependent on temperature, the working condition of the derived
OFET based on conjugated polymer/PE blends thus can be switched or
controlled by the external temperature.

2.2 Fabrication and Characterization of the Studied
OFET Devices
We first fabricate the OFET devices based on
the P3HT/PE blends with different blending ratios of 2:1; 1:1, and
1:2 (defined by the weight percentage between P3HT and PE; i.e., 67%:33%,
50%:50%, and 33%:67%, respectively) and investigate their FET characteristics. Figure 2 presents their transfer
characteristics and square root of the drain current measured at room
temperature, and the relevant device parameters are summarized in Table 2. All devices exhibit
a typical p-type behavior; however, the saturated hole mobility (μ)
of the device is decreased as the PE content in the active channel
increases. The μ of the pristine P3HT device is 7.69 ×
10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 and it is gradually decreased to 0.35 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 as the blending weight ratio of PE increases to 70%. Such a decrease
in mobility is apparently related to the insulating nature of amorphous
PE, which impedes the charge transport of the P3HT matrix to a certain
degree.

of the studied OFETs based on the P3HT/PE blends with different blending

To better understand the influence of PE addition,
the surface
morphology of the studied blends after annealing at 120 °C is
characterized by AFM. As shown in Figure 3, the morphology of the pristine P3HT film
consists of fibril-like structures. After adding 30 wt % PE, the fibril-like
structures of P3HT could be still preserved as evidenced by the uniform
distribution of self-assembled nanoaggregates. Notably, slightly different
to the pristine P3HT film, adding 30 wt % PE seems to even better
induce the formation of nanofibers that possess a finer diameter of
10–20 nm, whereas, as the blending amount of PE goes over 50
wt %, large-scale phase separation between P3HT and PE starts to occur,
which can be attributed to their distinct surface energy. P3HT with
a relatively lower surface energy (19.8 mJ·m–2)18 prefers to exist near the n-octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS) interface owing to its
similar surface energy, while PE with higher surface energy (30–31
mJ·m–2)19 tends
to accumulate near the surface of the film.20,21 The UV–vis absorption spectra of the P3HT/PE blends (after
annealing at 120 °C, Figure S2) were
measured to verify this observed behavior. The studied blends exhibit
similar absorption bands because of the strong interchain π–π
stacking of P3HT.22 Note that the λmax (518, 544, and 593 nm) of the pristine P3HT film was slightly
red-shifted to 524, 550, and 600 nm as the PE content continuously
increases to 70 wt %. It is probably due to the induced phase separation
and the promoted aggregates of polymer chains in the film state, which
is consistent with the AFM results. Besides, the low loading amount
of semiconducting P3HT will also reduce the overall charge transport
property. These abovementioned reasons clearly clarify the largely
decreased mobility of the OFET devices based on the P3HT/PE blend
films with a ratio of 1:1 and 1:2. To recognize the requirement of
adequate mobility for practical applications, the OFET device based
on the P3HT/PE blend film with a ratio of 2:1 (denoted as the P3HT/PE
device hereafter) that delivers a mobility of 0.68 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 with
a threshold voltage (Vth) of −2.11
V and an ON/OFF current ratio (ION/IOFF) of 7.80 × 103 is thus preferably
selected for further study.

2.3 Switching Behaviors of the OFET Devices in
Response to Temperature Change
2.3.1 Performance of the Studied OFET Devices
upon Temperature Change
To examine the thermoresponsive function
of the P3HT/PE (2:1) device, its FET characteristics are measured
under different temperatures. Because unstable and unreliable performance
of the P3HT/PE device might be acquired when measured under a temperature
beyond the melting point (Tm) of PE (∼130
°C, Table 1),
the device is set to be tested in the range between 30 and 120 °C
(Figure 4), and the
detailed OFET characteristics of both P3HT and P3HT/PE (2:1) devices
upon temperature changes are summarized in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. For the P3HT device, the entire transfer
curve is shifted toward the positive direction as the measured temperature
increases, which leads to a higher drain current (ON state) and enhanced
mobility as the measured temperature increases (as shown in Figure 5a,b). This phenomenon
could be attributed to thermally activated charge transport that is
a common effect in the typical OFETs. Besides, the varying behavior
observed herein is similar to the case reported in the literature.23,24

Figure 4 Transfer
characteristics of the studied OFETs based on (a,b) a
pristine P3HT film and (c,d) a P3HT/PE (2:1) blend film measured under
different temperatures between 30 and 120 °C, wherein the temperature
is gradually (a,c) increased from 30 to 120 °C or (b,d) cooled
from 120 to 30 °C. The entire transfer curve of the P3HT device
is shifted toward the positive direction as the measured temperature
increases (see the red arrow in (a)). However, (e,f) the extracted
transfer curve of the P3HT/PE device has clearly shown a very special
behavior that its transfer curve initially shifted toward the positive
direction under a measured temperature below 100 °C and subsequently
moved to the negative direction as the measured temperature increases
from 100 to 120 °C (red arrow in (e)). Both devices could return
back to their respective original position (blue arrow in (b,f)) when
the measured temperature is cooled down to room temperature (30 °C).

and P3HT/PE
device as a function of the measured temperature with a gradual increase
from 30 to 120 °C (under a heating process). (c) ON current and
(d) mobility of both the P3HT device and P3HT/PE device as a function
of the measured temperature with a gradual decrease from 120 to 30
°C (under a cooling process).

Interestingly, the P3HT/PE (2:1) device shows a
different varying
behavior as compared to the P3HT device. As shown in Figure 4c, the transfer curve of the
P3HT/PE device is initially shifted toward the positive direction
under a measured temperature below 90 °C. As the measured temperature
increases from 90 to 120 °C (close to the Tm of PE), the shift of the resulting transfer curve reverses
to the negative direction, leading to a significant decrease in current
of the transfer curve. Clearly, this suppress in the electrical properties
of the blending device results from the phase transition of the P3HT/PE
blends (at ∼90 °C), as shown in Figure S1. Accordingly, at the measured temperature of 120 °C,
the P3HT/PE device delivers the significantly decreased mobility of
0.48 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 with a reduced ON current of 1.81 × 10–6 A. Such largely decreased performance of the P3HT/PE
device at 120 °C is very different to the case of the P3HT device
at 120 °C. Besides, it represents a 13% decrease in ON current
and a 30% decrease in mobility compared to its performance measured
at 30 °C, revealing the capability of “current-flow inhibition”
under an overheating condition (120 °C herein). In addition,
PS which possesses the similar coefficient thermal expansion with
P3HT was also employed as a reference dielectric to compare the current
inhibition capability with the PE polymer (as seen from Figure S3). The P3HT/PS device shows a similar
trend to the P3HT/PE device upon heating (30–120 °C),
for which the mobility starts to decrease at ∼ 80 °C.
However, for the P3HT/PS device, the effect of thermal inhibition
of mobility is relatively smaller than that of the P3HT/PE device
because of the different thermal expansion coefficients between PS
and PE.

Moreover, the performance of both devices could recover
back to
their respective original states (almost similar values of mobility)
when the measured temperature is cooled down to room temperature (Figure 5c,d). To recognize
their recovery ability, a series of heating–cooling cycles
(five cycles) was run on P3HT and P3HT/PE devices to evaluate recovery
performance (Figure 6). Both of these showed comparable performance (focusing on values
of mobility) in the cycling test that further reveals the possibility
in reusability of the P3HT/PE device after inhibition at high external
temperature. Such reversible behavior observed in the resulting performance
manifests the good thermal sensitivity of the P3HT/PE device. Besides,
it validates the concept of using a thermal expansion polymer to enrich
the thermoresponsivity of an OFET device because the volume expansion
or contraction of PE can effectively modulate the charge transport
of the P3HT matrix on temperature changes.

P3HT and (b) P3HT/PE device after serial
heating–cooling cycles with an initial increase from 30 to
120 °C (under a heating process) and then decrease from 120 to
30 °C (under a cooling process).

2.3.2 Proposed Mechanism for the Thermoresponsive
Behavior
Considering the influence of the volume expansion
or contraction of PE in relation to the resulting morphology of the
derived active channel, we next further investigate the variation
of morphology of the studied films upon temperature by synchrotron
grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS, Figure S4). The crystalline lattice constants
and orientation information by (h00) and (0k0) scatterings of each film are collected after it reaches
the desired temperature. As seen, the GIWAXS patterns of both films
present a similar (100) peak because of the lamellar structure of
P3HT and a similar (010) scattering peak because of the π–π
interchain stacking of P3HT, which confirms the intermolecular self-assembly
due to the π–π interactions. However, in the P3HT/PE
blend film, the diffraction peak of P3HT is weakened (Figure S4c), which indicates that the amorphous
PE surrounds the lamellar structure of P3HT.

Table 3 summarizes the d-spacing values of the studied films as determined by the relation
of d = 2π/q*. For the pristine
P3HT film, the d-spacing value shows a slight decrease
of ∼0.01 nm in the π–π stacking peak and
no apparent change in the lamellar spacing after heating to 120 °C,
whereas, the P3HT/PE blend film shows an opposite trend, for which
no change in the π–π stacking peak and an increase
of ∼0.6 nm in the lamellar spacing are observed after heating
to 120 °C. The distinctly different temperature-dependent variation
of nanostructures of the P3HT and P3HT/PE films explains their different
performance-temperature dependency as observed. The high thermal expansion
of PE clearly endows the derived blend with certain thermoresponsivity
because it expands as temperature increases, which will further separate
the crystalline domains of P3HT. Without using such amorphous and
thermal expansion polymer, there are no changes among the crystalline
regions of P3HT. Instead, the polymer chains will become closer as
temperature increases, enabling more efficient charge transport between
chains as observed.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we report a
simple method to develop a thermoresponsive
switching OFET by using an active material consisting of a semiconducting
polymer, P3HT, and a thermal expansion polymer, PE. We manifest that,
owing to the thermistor matrix of PE, the FET characteristics of P3HT
are largely changed at high temperatures (100–120 °C).
The high volume expansion of PE at such high temperature (near its Tm) effectively increases the distance of the
crystalline domains of P3HT to result in a great inhibition of current.
Compared to the performance measured at room temperature (∼30
°C), our optimized P3HT/PE (with a weight ratio of 2:1) device
exhibits a 13% decreased ON current and a 30% decreased mobility at
a high temperature of 120 °C, in contrast to the pristine P3HT
device. Moreover, the performance of this device could recover back
to its original value after cooling from 120 to 30 °C owing to
the volume contraction of PE. This reversible behavior of performance
with temperature manifests the good thermal sensitivity of the P3HT/PE
device. We thus successfully demonstrate a proof-of-concept device
that can facilitate the future development of thermoresponsive OFETs
for overheating protection applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
P3HT (Mw of 54 000–75 000 g/mol), PE (Mw of 35 000 g/mol), and OTS were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Anhydrous toluene (99.8%) was obtained from Acros
Organics. Other reagents were reagent grade and used without further
purification.

4.2 Fabrication and Characterization of OFET Devices
The transistor switch was fabricated on a substrate of highly doped
n-type Si wafer with 300 nm thick SiO2. Later, the surface
of the substrate was functionalized with an OTS self-assembled monolayer.
Before spin-coating the active layers, the OTS-treated substrate was
washed with toluene, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then blow-dried
with nitrogen gas before use. The studied P3HT and P3HT/PE blend (70%:30%,
50%:50%, and 30%:70%) with a concentration of 8 mg/mL in toluene were
spin-coated onto the OTS-treated substrates to obtain thin film with
a thickness of ∼40 nm in a glovebox. The thermal annealing
process was continuously carried out at 120 °C for 1 h inside
the glovebox. Finally, the top-contact gold electrode (70 nm) was
thermally deposited by evaporation through a regular shadow mask with
a channel length (L) and width (W) of 50 and 1000 μm, respectively. All the device performance
of the fabricated transistors were conducted inside a glovebox by
using a Keithley 4200-SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley
Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) which equipped a hot plate for
controlling desired temperature.

4.3 Characterization
The surface morphologies
of the polymer films were characterized using a Nanoscope 3D controller
atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instruments) operated in the
tapping mode. Additionally, the change in the nanostructure of the
polymer film with temperature was measured on an in situ heating stage
at beamline BL13A1 with a wavelength of 0.827 Å (15 keV) at an
incident angle of 0.15° in the NSRRC.
