Devices
consisting of polymer disks (PDs) of optically clear or
translucent, medical-grade silicone loaded with a new hydrophobic,
oxygen-stable, photoactivated nitric oxide-releasing moiety (photoNORM)
are described. The photoNORM is the new O-nitrito
chromium(III) complex trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2](BF4) (PetA = 5,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-1,4,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane),
of which the synthesis, X-ray crystal structure, and solution-phase
photochemistry are described. Several different commercially available
silicone polymers were tested with this photoNORM, and nitric oxide
photouncaging with 451 nm light from these systems is compared. In
addition, PDs were loaded with the photoNORM and neodymium-sensitized
upconverting nanoparticles (Nd-UCNPs). The Nd-UCNPs absorb NIR light
at ∼800 nm and activate NO release from the trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]+ cation. The use of such ensembles
as implants provides a potential strategy for the in vivo uncaging
of NO at physiological targets triggered by tissue-transmitting NIR
excitation. Also reported are the X-ray crystal structures of cis- and trans-{Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl.

Introduction
There has been considerable
recent interest in developing strategies
for photolysis-induced release (photouncaging) of various bioactive
small molecules at physiological targets for potential therapeutic
applications.1−11 One such molecule is the promiscuous bioregulator nitric oxide (NO),
which plays important roles in mammalian cardiovascular and neurobiology
as well as immune response12,13 and which, among other
properties, displays antibacterial activity in combating biofilms.14 This combination has drawn attention from this
laboratory15−17 and others18−25 to the design and study of photoactivated NO-releasing moieties
(photoNORMs). The advantages of photouncaging include exquisite control
of the timing, location, and dosages of delivery. However, two disadvantages
come immediately to the forefront. The first is the difficulty in
localizing the caged bioactive molecule at the desired target area,
where release can be triggered with light. The other is the rather
poor transmission of ultraviolet and visible wavelengths through mammalian
tissue with the exception of the relatively narrow window falling
at long visible and shorter near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths.26 Not only do shorter wavelengths penetrate poorly
but the resulting tissue heating from the absorption of these wavelengths
can also lead to collateral damage.

One approach to targeted
placement at a specific site is to incorporate
the bioactive compound into a solid matrix (for example, a biocompatible
polymer) that can be used as an implant.27−30 Implants are already used for
timed drug release,31 but one using a caged
precursor allows release only upon demand and provides dosage control
by the amount of light used.32 Such a device
could be attached to an optical fiber that would transmit light to
the target site to uncage the desired bioactive molecule. Alternatively,
if the device were responsive to NIR excitation, then the use of the
fiber and associated hardware may be unnecessary.

In this context,
we previously described devices consisting of
mm-sized poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) polymer disks (PDs) containing
upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) and infused with Roussin’s
black salt Na[Fe4S3(NO)7] (RBS).33 UCNPs serve as antennas to effect NIR-to-visible
(or UV) upconversion by sequential multiphoton excitation at 980 nm
with the lanthanide ion Yb3+ as the light-absorbing sensitizer
and a second lanthanide ion (Er3+ or Tm3+) as
the emitter of visible and/or UV wavelengths after energy transfer
from the sensitizer.34−38 The upconverted light emitted from the UCNPs was reabsorbed by the
RBS, leading to photoinduced NO release from this photoNORM.39 The advantage of UCNPs is that upconversion
requires much lower-excitation intensities than does simultaneous
two-photon excitation; so, one can use a relatively simple diode laser
operating at 980 nm to effect multiphoton excitation of the UCNPs
leading to NO release.34 Furthermore, we
demonstrated that NIR excitation triggered photouncaging from these
RBS-containing devices even through tissue filters.33

Described here is an investigation of analogous devices
based on
PDs prepared from a series of different commercially available, medical-grade,
biocompatible silicone polymers with the goal of evaluating whether
different formulations would affect the photochemical uncaging of
NO. The photoNORM selected in these studies is the BF4– salt of the previously unreported chromium(III) complex
cation trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]+ (PetACrONO), where PetA = 5,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane,
the synthesis of which is described. The PetACrONO salt is photoactive
toward NO release in solution, is hydrophobic, and is readily infused
into PDs prepared from these polymers. Nitric oxide uncaging from
the resulting devices can be activated by visible light excitation.

Also described are PDs prepared both with PetACrONO and with
this
photoNORM and neodymium(III)-doped β-NaYF4:Tm/Nd/Yb/Gd@NaYF4:Nd-UCNPs (Nd-UCNPs).40,41 The advantage of Nd-UCNPs
is that these can be excited with a continuous NIR diode laser operating
at ∼800 nm42,43 and the resulting upconverted
visible light is reabsorbed by the photoNORM to uncage NO. Excitation
at ∼800 nm allows one to avoid the modest absorbance by water
at 980 nm, thereby improving NIR transmission depth and reducing potential
tissue damage due to heating effects. During the course of the experiments
described here, Ostrowski and co-workers30 reported the NIR-induced release of NO from several polysilicone
composites containing the well-studied44,45 photoNORM trans-[Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2]X (“CrONO”,
cyclam = 1,4,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane, X– =
BF4– or BPh4–) and UCNPs that are activated by visible and 980 nm excitation.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The NaYF4:Yb/Tm/Nd/Gd (30/0.5/1/20 mol %)@NaGdF4:Nd
(20 mol %) core–shell UCNPs (Nd-UCNPs) used in these studies
were provided by Dr. E. M. Chan and E. S. Levy at the Molecular Foundry
of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The biocompatible silicone
polymers used included NuSil Technology LLC formulations MED-4805,
MED4-4220, MED-6019, MED-6215, MED-6233, and MED-6755. The NuSil silicones
were gifts from the Allergan Corporation and NuSil Technology LLC.

Syntheses
The synthesis of the PetACrONO salts is outlined
in Scheme 1. The ligand
PetA was prepared by the NaBH4 reduction of the unsaturated
macrocycle 5,14-dimethyl-7,12-diphenyl-l,4,8,11 tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,14-diene,
as described by Hideg and Lloyd.46 The
dichloro Cr(III) complex trans-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl was prepared by the reaction of PetA and CrCl3(THF)3 in refluxing dimethylformamide, as described by DeRosa for
analogous macrocycles.47 This procedure
gives a mixture of the cis- and trans-complexes, which was separated by chromatography on silica. For
the reaction with PetA, the latter is favored (70% yield) over the
less desirable cis form (10%), which could be converted
to the trans form by refluxing in dichloromethane
(DCM). The bis(O-nitrito) complex salt trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 was synthesized from trans-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl by procedures modified
from those described for the cyclam analogues (Scheme 1).43 Synthesis
details and analytical data are reported in the Supporting Information (SI).

See the SI for more details.

X-ray Crystallography
The solid-state crystal structures
of trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 and of cis- and trans-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl were determined by X-ray diffraction on a Kappa Apex II
single-crystal diffractometer. X-ray structural data are summarized
in SI Tables S1–S3.

Preparation
and Loading of Polymer Disks
Procedures
similar to those described previously33 were used. The round PDs (10 mm diameter, 2 mm thick) were fabricated
by mixing the monomer base (Part A) and the curing agent (Part B)
in the weight ratios recommended by data sheets from the manufacturer
NuSil Technology for the different formulations and then deaerated
under vacuum in the antechamber of an inert atmosphere box for 25
min. An aliquot of this mixture (∼200 μL) was added to
a custom-made mold (10 mm diameter, 2 mm height). Next, the PD was
annealed at ∼110 °C for ∼1 h and then allowed to
set at room temperature for at least 12 h. After fabrication, the
PDs were removed from the mold and transferred into the glovebox for
infusion of the photoNORM. This was done by incubating the PD in a
concentrated tetrahydrofuran solution (0.4 mL) of trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 (3.1 mg/mL) for 5 h followed
by vacuum drying. This was repeated 3 times. Finally, the dried PDs
were washed with THF and methanol and multiple times with water to
remove surface photoNORM that was not impregnated into the PD. This
was repeated until no PetACrONO was detected in the wash solution.
After several such washes, no leaching was evident in the solution
spectra even after 24 h incubation in aqueous media. The resulting
PDs were stored in the dark under an inert atmosphere until use. For
PDs prepared for NIR studies, a 5 mg portion of the solid Nd-UCNPs
was physically mixed with the polymer in the disk molds before curing.

The loading efficiency was analyzed by ICP-MS. The PDs were digested
in a 5 mL volume of a 1 M ammonium tetrafluoroborate solution in THF
for 5 days. The solutions were then heated at 50 °C to evaporate
the THF, and the resulting oils were further digested in concentrated
nitric acid for 2 days. The nitric acid was then removed by heating,
and the resulting solution was redissolved into a 2% nitric acid solution.
Analysis was carried out using an Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole ICP-MS
calibrated against a chromium standard. Although there was some variation
from disk to disk, the loading efficiency, after washing, fell in
the range of 65–97% (82% ave.) of the initial PetACrONO available.

Photochemical Studies
Solution-Phase Studies
Photolysis
of PetACrONO was
carried out in isobutyronitrile solution. The NO release was determined
by entraining the photolysis solution contained in a “Y”
cell with medical-grade air, which then flowed to a Sievers Nitric
Oxide Analyzer (NOA, GE model NOA-280i), where it was detected and
quantified via a calibrated chemiluminescence technique (SI Figure S1). (In each case, the entraining gas
was purged through a solvent bubbler prior to entering the photolysis
cell to reduce evaporative losses.) The photoexcitation source was
either the 365 nm emission from a 200 W high-pressure mercury lamp
isolated with an interference filter or the 451 nm light from a Luxeon
blue light-emitting diode (LED) (SI Figure S2). Excitation intensities at 365 nm were determined by ferrioxalate
actinometry,47 while those at 451 nm were
determined with a power meter (Newport model 8442 PE). Excitation
intervals were controlled using a Uniblitz shutter, and quantum yields
of NO release (ΦNO) were determined by evaluating
the NO released and recorded using the NOA software (“Liquid”)
for varied excitation intervals. The slope of a plot of NO released
vs total light absorbed by the solution gives ΦNO (SI Figure S3).

Photoreactions
in Polymer Disks
The PDs were attached
to a glass substrate using a double-sided tape that was then mounted
into a flow cell where the photolysis was effected under streaming
helium or medical-grade air (SI Figure S1).32 The NO released from the sample was
transferred from the cell via the flowing gas to the NOA, where it
was detected and quantified. The visible photoexcitation source was
the royal blue (451 nm) Luxeon LED operating in the 45–500
mW range. The NIR photoexcitation source (794 nm) was a Sheaupac NIR
fiber-coupled diode laser module from ILX Lightwave. Incident photon
flux during photolysis was measured using a Newport model 8442 PE
optical power meter with a silicon photodiode detector. The photolysis
laser beam (0.8 mm diameter) was oscillated by reflecting of two movable
mirrors controlled by a Tektronix AFG320 arbitrary function digital
generator, as described previously (SI Figure S4).32 The two mirrors each control
the scanning width in one direction (horizontal or vertical) so that
adjusting the individual oscillating frequencies defines the size
of the scanned area. Experiments were run with mirror frequencies
of 78.93 and 48.93 Hz, which scanned the collimated laser beam over
most of the 10 mm diameter PDs to compensate for inhomogeneities in
Nd-UCNP distribution in the polymer matrices while avoiding the damage
that sometimes occurred when focusing on a single spot.32 Excitation intervals were controlled by the
Uniblitz shutter.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses and Structures
of Trans-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl and Trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4
Scheme 1 illustrates the sequence used
to prepare these two new compounds.
The cis-dichlorido complex cis-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl is an isolable minor byproduct of the synthesis of the trans-analogue (see the Supporting Information for more details). The X-ray crystal structure of the trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO)2+ cation is displayed in Figure 1, and the unit cell
structure of the trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 salt is shown in SI Figure S5. The unit cell structure of trans-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl is shown in SI Figure S6. Data
(crystal and structural refinement data, atomic coordinates plus bond
lengths and angles) from the crystal structure determinations of these
two compounds and for cis-[Cr(PetA)Cl2]Cl are summarized, respectively, in SI Tables S1–S3. The Cl–Cr–Cl angles for the cis- and trans-dichlorido complexes are
88.8 and 180.0°, respectively. The electronic spectrum of PetACrONO
is shown in Figure 2.

Solution-Phase Photochemical
Reactions
The solution-phase
photolysis of trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 was examined using the Sievers NOA to evaluate the photolability
of this photoNORM toward NO release. The NOA determines with high
sensitivity and precision the NO that is swept from the photolysis
solution with an entraining gas (either He or medical-grade air).
For PetACrONO, photoactivated NO release was readily apparent as has
been shown previously for the photolysis of trans-Cr(cyclam)(ONO)2+ (“CrONO”,
cyclam = l,4,8,11-tetraaza-cyclotetradecane). Earlier studies showed
CrONO to undergo reversible CrO–NO bond homolysis to give NO
and a Cr(IV) intermediate (eq 1) that can be trapped by various oxidants or reductants.43 Quantum yields of NO release (ΦNO) were relatively insensitive to excitation wavelength over the range
of 365–436 nm with values in the range of 0.18–0.28
over various conditions.44 Photolysis at
546 nm gave comparable photochemistry, despite the very low extinction
coefficients at this wavelength 1  Similarly, 451 nm photolysis
of an isobutyronitrile
solution of PetACrONO (0.5 mM) led to NO release as detected with
the NOA. Medical-grade air was the entraining gas, and the quantitative
analysis of the NO released during short defined photolysis intervals
gave a ΦNO value of 0.32 ± 0.01 (Figure S3), indicating that the photochemistry
and photolability of the trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO)2+ cation are comparable to those of CrONO itself.44 Thus, the introduction of phenyl and methyl
groups to the cyclam ring and switching to a less polar medium did
not inhibit the overall photolability of PetACrONO toward NO release.
Analogous photolysis of PetACrONO in acetonitrile solvent using 365
nm excitation gave a similar result (ΦNO = 0.30 ±
0.01).

Visible-Range Photochemistry of Loaded Polymer Disks
The above experiments demonstrated that 1 is photolabile
toward NO release in fluid media. However, the question remains whether
this photolability would lead to ready NO release from the PDs infused
with PetACrONO. To address this point, a series of PDs were prepared
from different commercial silicone-based polymer formulations (NuSil)
and were infused with PetACrONO using the highly self-consistent procedures
described in the Experimental Section. The
silicone polymers used to fabricate the PDs are proprietorial, commercial
formulations currently in use for in vivo biomedical applications.
These proprietary biocompatible formulations may include different
quantities of monomers, cross-linkers, resins, silica, processing
aids, fillers, inhibitors, and catalysts that are designed to control
the desired properties such as appearance, optical clarity, viscosity,
specific gravity, tensile and tear strengths, gas permeability, etc.
In all of the cases, the polymer disks appeared to be optically clear
or translucent.

Photolysis studies were carried out using visible
light excitation with a royal blue LED operating at 451 nm for PDs
loaded only with [trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 or using NIR excitation with a diode laser operating
at 794 nm for PDs loaded both with this photoNORM and with the Nd-UCNPs. Figure 3 illustrates the
NOA signals recorded for the 451 nm LED photolysis of a PetACrONO-infused
PD prepared from NuSil Technology Med-6233 for excitation times of
1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 s at 45 mW. The integrated signals provide a quantitative
evaluation of the NO released in each case, the average values being
119 ± 9, 193 ± 4, and 272 ± 10 pmol, respectively.
Although the longer photolysis times led to larger integrated signals,
the increase was not linear. This nonlinearity may reflect the reversibility
of the photoreaction in analogy to eq 1. Given that the diffusion of NO out of the polymer
is relatively slow (see below), the back-reaction with the Cr(IV)
oxo intermediate as in eq 1 may deplete the net amount of NO released from the PD and thus lower
the photochemical efficiency. A similar pattern was observed for 451
nm photolyses of PDs prepared from the other silicone formulations
infused with [trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 (SI Table S4). In addition, successive
experiments, showed a modest decrease in the quantity of NO released,
suggesting some depletion of the PetACrONO present in the PDs, which
on the average totaled ∼1.7 μmol.

Figure 3 NOA data for 451 nm photolysis
(45 mW) of silicone MED-6233 infused
with [trans-Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 for photolysis intervals of 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 s. The net amount
of NO released from the disk was calculated from the integrated NOA
signals.

Close examination of the individual
signals shown in Figure 3 indicates that upon 451 nm
excitation of the infused PD for a period from 1.0 to 5.0 s, there
is a rise of the NOA signal for several seconds, reflecting, in part,
the response time of the apparatus shown in Figure S1. This is followed by a decay of the signal that fits reasonably
well to a single exponential decay function (Figure 4). For example, the NOA signal decay subsequent
to a 1.0 s irradiation of PetACrONO infused in a Med-6233 PD displayed
an average lifetime (τdecay) of 17.0 ± 0.3 s
(Figure 4), and this
was reproducible for subsequent 1 s excitations within the experimental
uncertainty given. Similar decays were observed for the 2.5 and 5.0
s irradiation periods of the same sample, although the fits gave somewhat
smaller values of τdecay, 14.1 ± 0.2 and 12.3
± 0.1 s, respectively. As would be expected, these decay properties
are a property of the specific silicone formulation utilized to prepare
the PDs, although the differences in the calculated τdecay values are not dramatic. These data are presented in SI Figures S7–S9 and SI Table S5, with τdecay values ranging from
14 to 28 s with samples excited for 1.0 s and with similar ranges
(∼12–22 and ∼11–19 s, respectively) for
excitation times of 2.5 and of 5.0 s. A logical explanation for the
decay lifetimes would be that they represent diffusion to the surface
of the NO released by photoexcitation of PetACrONO at a collection
of different accessible sites within the polymer matrix. Given the
heterogeneity of these devices, there is no reason to expect strictly
exponential decays, despite the apparent shapes of these curves.

of the NOA signal fit to a first-order exponential.

NIR Photochemistry of Loaded Polymer Disks
Figure 5 demonstrates
the
overlap between the emission from Nd-UCNPs upon 794 nm excitation
and the absorption spectrum of PetACrONO. The upconverted visible
emission from these Nd-UCNPs is readily apparent in SI Figure S10, which illustrates the result of passing
a beam of 794 nm light through a hexane solution containing this material.
PDs from single polymer formulation, NuSil Technology Med-6019, were
used for these studies given the relatively modest differences in
the photochemical properties of the PetACrONO-loaded PDs summarized
in SI Tables S4 and S5.

spectrum of trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4 in acetonitrile (green
line) to the photoluminescence spectrum of the Nd/Tm-UCNP: β-NaYF4:Tm/Nd/Yb/Gd-(0.5/1.0/30/20%)@ NaGdF4:Tm(20%) upon
794 nm excitation with the laser power 1100 mW (blue).

Figure 6 displays
the NOA signals observed upon 794 nm excitation of Med-6019 PDs loaded
with PETACrONO and with the Nd-UCNPs. NO release that increases with
increasing laser power is readily apparent. The averaged integrated
NOA signals demonstrate the release of 26.4, 56.6, 88.7, and 110.3
pmol of NO for excitations at 300, 567, 833, and 1100 mW, respectively.
No nitric oxide was released upon 794 nm irradiation of a PD loaded
only with PETACrONO; so, this behavior can readily be attributed to
the presence of the Nd-UCNPs. The NO release proved to be almost linear
with the laser power employed, and this proved somewhat unexpected
given the nonlinear behavior seen for aqueous solutions containing
the photoNORM RBS (Na[Fe4S3(NO)7])
and silica-coated NaYF4:Yb/Er@NaYF4 core/shell
UCNPs that are activated with 980 nm excitation.39 However, as noted above, direct excitation at 451 nm did
not respond linearly to irradiation time, and this was attributed
to enhanced back-reactions when more NO was generated in a single
event. Thus, two counteracting trends may be at play in the present
case.

Summary
In these studies, we report the synthesis and
characterization
of a new lipid-soluble photoNORM, the chromium(III) O-nitrito complex salt trans-[Cr(PetA)(ONO)2]BF4. Visible light excitation of silicone polymer disks
prepared from various biocompatible commercial formulations triggers
the release of NO in quantities determined by the length of the excitation
pulse. Thus, photouncaging from such an implantable device allows
one to define the location, timing, and dosage for the release of
this potent bioregulator. However, with the exception of a subcutaneous
implant, such a device would need to be attached to an optical fiber
owing to the relatively poor tissue transmission of visible light.
To address this issue, we also report that including neodymium-doped
β-NaYF4:Tm/Nd/Yb/Gd@NaYF4:Nd, upconverting
nanoparticles in the polymer disk allows the use of much more penetrating
NIR wavelengths at ∼800 nm as the excitation source. NIR photoexcitation
of these UCNPs leads to the emission of upconverted visible light
and activates NO release from the photoNORM. The mechanism of such
photosensitization has not been determined, although it is likely
that this occurs by “trivial” energy transfer, namely,
the emission of light from the UCNP followed by reabsorption by the
photoNORM.

The above studies represent a continuation of our
earlier demonstration
of NO uncaging by 980 nm photoexcitation of poly(dimethylsiloxane)
PDs containing the RBS as the photoNORM and β-NaYF4:Er/Yb/Gd@NaYF4 UCNPs as the NIR activator.33 Although the latter investigation showed that
such NIR photoactivation could indeed be effected through tissue filters,
the inclusion of Nd3+ in the core and shell of the Nd-UCNPs
used here allows the application of 794 nm excitation and thus avoids
potential heat damage owing to the modest absorbance by water at 980
nm.42

We had anticipated that the
different commercial formulations of
the silicone polymers might lead to considerable differences in performance
with regard to NO uncaging. However, the differences are relatively
small, with both the quantity and τdecay for NO release
upon a short-term (e.g., 1 s) excitation varying only about a factor
of 2 for the various formulations (SI Tables S4 and S5). This similarity may, in part, be due to each of these
formulations being silicone-based but also is likely the result of
the photoNORM being infused into preformed PDs as opposed to being
codissolved prior to the gelling process. As a result, this precursor
is located at readily accessible sites where NO once uncaged can diffuse
to the surface. In contrast, Ostrowski and co-workers prepared similarly
sized films of composites but dissolved their photoNORM in the polymers
prior to curing, resulting in marked differences in release efficiencies
depending on the gas permeabilities of the materials involved.30

Inclusion of the Gd3+ in
the formulation
of UCNPs was for synthetic convenience since the only function is
to facilitate formation of the hexagonal phase of NaYF4 (ref (41)). Given
the toxicity of gadolinium salts, extensions of such studies to in
vivo experiments would utilize other procedures to achieve the same
purpose.
