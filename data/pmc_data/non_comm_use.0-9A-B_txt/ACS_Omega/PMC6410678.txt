It has been well established that
mutations in K-Ras and N-Ras proto-oncogenes
can convert them into
active oncogenes. Current molecular cancer research has been focused
on determining the key steps by which cellular genes become oncogenes
and not on the underlying and fundamental chemical damage mechanism
and susceptibility to damage. In this study, we investigate the damage
hot spots present in the N-Ras and K-Ras genes upon exposure to UVC radiation. Detection of damage is accomplished
by a simple, sensitive, mix-and-read assay using an EvaGreen probe
in a 96-well microtiter plate. Our results show that, although there
is high degree of sequential similarities among K-Ras and N-Ras genes, they show different degrees of
UV damage in different portions of their genomes. Our experiments
demonstrate that overall, the K-Ras genome is more
prone to UVC damage than the N-Ras genome. We observe
that the extent of damage increases with increasing number of TTs
in a sequence, consistent with previous results that show that thymine
cyclobutyl photodimers are the primary DNA damage photoproducts upon
UVC irradiation. This understanding of the effect of UVC radiation
on various codons of K-Ras and N-Ras genes will help to increase our understanding about hot spots of
DNA damage and the chemical damage mechanism.

Introduction
Mutational activation
of the Ras family of genes
has been found to be one of the principal oncogenic events in cancer.1,2 The Ras family encodes small GTPase proteins involved
in cellular signal transduction and consist of three proto-oncogenes,
K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras.1,3,4 Although there is a
high degree of homogeneity among the different Ras gene sequences, preliminary studies have demonstrated that many
different tumors are identified with different Ras genes.5 However, no correlation has been
established between an activated Ras oncogene and
the tumor type present. Apparently, mutation of Ras proto-oncogenes is not essential for tumorigenesis, but it can still
be a contributing factor to human carcinogenesis.6

Much effort has been made to investigate how mutation
leads to
the activation of the Ras genes. Past research has
shown that mutation at any of the codons 12, 13, and 61 in any of
the three Ras genes is capable of activating their
oncogenic functions.3,7,8 Interestingly,
it has been found that mutation preferentially occurs at codon 12
of K-Ras rather than at codon 13 or 61 of K-Ras or at any N-Ras or H-Ras condon.7,9,10 Furthermore,
on investigating the repair mechanism between codon 12 and the other
condons, it was observed that there was no substantial difference
in their repair rates. These findings raise a pivotal question: What
factors determine the oncogenic properties of Ras proto-oncogenes? In this paper, we explore one aspect of this question,
the relationship between DNA damage and mutational hot spots of Ras genes.

It is well known that UV radiation is one
of the major causes of
skin cancer.11 Animal model studies12,13 have inferred that UV irradiation can introduce point mutations
in the Ras proto-oncogene. These point mutations
lead to the production of Ras protein with diminished
or no GTPase activity. Loss of GTPase activity shifts the equilibrium
between active GTP-bound Ras protein and inactive
GDP-bound Ras protein to produce a more active GTP.
The active GTP-bound Ras protein can now stimulate
a plethora of downstream processes causing unregulated signal transduction
and facilitating the development of skin cancer.8,14−16 The major photoproducts induced in DNA by UVC light
are the cyclobutyl pyrimidine photodimers (CPDs) and (6–4)
pyrimidine-pyrimidinone photoproducts.13,17 In vitro UVC
irradiation experimental studies have already shown that UV light
forms a point mutation at codons 12 and 618 in the N-Ras gene. Another site-directed mutagenesis
experiment performed by introducing CPDs at predetermined sites showed
that the photodimer could induce a point mutation at the modified
positions.18 However, it is equally important
to determine if the Ras genes are activated by the
production of CPD in the gene. Recent in vitro experiments have demonstrated
that proto-oncogene expression in human epidermis increases as a result
of UV radiation, leading to a high rate of cell proliferation and
differentiation.19

Current molecular
cancer research has been focused on determining
the key steps by which cellular genes become oncogenes, not on the
underlying and fundamental chemical damage mechanisms and susceptibility
to damage. To address this, there is a need to develop a new assay
that can screen the entire genome of DNA in a high-throughput fashion
with nucleotide resolution. Microarray technology is being extensively
used for the study of gene expression and its changes in different
cell states for a large population of genes simultaneously.20,21 However, the wider acceptance of the microarray is limited due to
the use of time-consuming and potentially biased image processing
software22 for sample analysis. A DNA hybridization
assay combined with fluorescence detection by label-free probes serves
to be a simple, fast, inexpensive and sensitive method to study DNA
damage.23,24 Unlike the microarray, hybridization assays
neither use laborious software for data analysis nor expensive fluorescently
labeled DNA probes for damage quantification. In this work, we use
a 96-well microplate platform coupled with a fluorescent intercalating
dye, EvaGreen (EG),25,26 to develop a multiplexed solution-phase
hybridization assay for investigating the mutational hot spots of
damage present in Ras genes. Earlier studies have
already proven that K-Ras is more susceptible to
mutation when compared to N-Ras.3,15,27 Thus, in this study, we chose to investigate
the effect of UVC radiation on the entire genomes of both K-Ras and N-Ras.

Results and Discussion
K-Ras and N-Ras Damage by
UVC Radiation
The oligonucleotide sequences used in this
study that make up the K-Ras and N-Ras genes are listed in Table 1. To enable better localization of damage and to attempt to
correlate damage susceptibility with sequence, each Ras gene was split into 32 oligonucleotide sequences of 7 codons each,
with the first and last codons in each sequence overlapping in the
previous and following sequences, respectively. All oligonucleotides
for both Ras genes gave a positive damage response
to UVC radiation, i.e., all oligonucleotides showed a decrease in
fluorescence from the EG dye upon increasing UVC irradiation. EG dye
is an intercalating dye constructed of two monomeric units joined
through a flexible linker. This dimeric dye is inactive in the absence
of dsDNA and assumes a closed-looped conformation in a solution with
two chromophores in close proximity to one another. In this conformation,
the fluorescence is quenched. This looped conformation of EG opens
upon binding and intercalation to dsDNA when present, separating the
two chromophores. In this open, intercalated form, the EG exhibits
maximum fluorescence. The equilibrium between the inactive and active
form of EG in the presence of DNA is regulated by the DNA double helical
structure. Upon damage of dsDNA, a change in its helical structure
occurs due to the disruptions to the normal base paring, leading to
a release of bound EG and a consequent reduction in EG fluorescence.25 Thus, we see a decrease in the fluorescence
intensity with increasing damage (damage susceptibility). Damage susceptibility
increases from 0 to 83% for K-Ras and 0–69%
for N-Ras, depending on the nucleobases present in
different sequences. The results of UVC-induced damage are listed
in Table 2 for K-Ras and Table 3 for N-Ras oligonucleotide sequences.

those on the previous and following strands, respectively. However,
the last sequence for K-Ras has 5 and N-Ras has 4 overlapping codons from the previous strands. This is done
to maintain a constant sequence length of 21 nucleobases. All the

a This table
is ordered by the number
of TT bipyrimidine sites in the N-Ras oligonucleotides
used in this study. The damage susceptibility is calculated as (1
– F), where F = Fi/Fc, Fi is the fluorescence intensity of EG-dsDNA upon damage and Fc is the fluorescence intensity of the undamaged
DNA-EG control sample. The columns headed as TT, CC, and CT list the
number of respective bipyrimidine sites in the oligonucleotides.

To understand the relationship
between UVC damage and the sequence
composition, we plotted the correlation diagrams for all possible
nucleobase pairs. Here it is worth mentioning that only the correlation
depicted in Figure 1 shows a significant positive correlation of all the correlations
between sequence and damage susceptibility attempted; all other plots
are included in the Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2) for completeness. Figure 1 indicates the plot with damage susceptibility
as a function of number of TT sites for both K-Ras and N-Ras oligonucleotide sequences. It is already
known that DNA damage by UVC radiation primarily occurs due to the
formation of pyrimidine dimers such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers
(CPDs), [6–4] pyrimidine pyrimidinone photoproducts ([6–4]
PPs), and photohydrates.28,29 The CPDs and [6–4]
PPs can potentially be formed between TT, CC, CT, and TC30 nucleotide pairs. From Figure 1, it can be clearly seen that the damage
shows a strong positive linear correlation with increasing numbers
of TT sites; no significant correlation is seen between damage and
other bipyrimidine sites (see the Supporting Information). This result is expected for UVC-induced dsDNA damage, since the
yield of T<>T photodimers is the highest (∼77%) compared
to any other bipyrimidine lesion.31−33 It is interesting that
the UVC-induced dsDNA damage gives a better R2 value for K-Ras (0.90) than for N-Ras (0.23) oligonucleotides. This could be because of the
presence of a higher total number (134) and larger range (0–10)
of TT sites in K-Ras when compared to the number
(93) and range (0–6) of TT sites in N-Ras oligonucleotides.
Another interesting result obtained by the study of damage susceptibility
as a function of sequence composition is a small, negative correlation
between damage and GG (R2 = 0.44) or GT
(R2 = 0.35) bipyrimidine sites in K-Ras (Figures S1 and S2), suggesting
that GG and GT bipyrimidine sites may provide a mild protective effect
to UVC irradiation. No such effect is observed in the N-Ras sequences.

Figure 1 UVC damage susceptibility (1 – F) as a
function of the number of TT dinucleotide sites for K-Ras and N-Ras. The damage susceptibility on the y-axis is 1 – F, where F = Fi/Fc, Fi is the fluorescence intensity of EG-dsDNA
upon UVC damage and Fc is the fluorescence
intensity of the undamaged DNA-EG control sample. The EG dye fluorescence
intensity at 530 nm is measured in the presence of 1 μM dsDNA
(10 mM Tris, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4). The solid line through the filled square points is a linear
fit for the K-Ras sequences with its R2 value indicated in the upper portion of the plot. The
dashed line through the empty circle points is the linear fit for
the N-Ras sequences with its R2 value indicated in the lower portion of the plot.

The correlation between damage susceptibility and
increasing number
of TT sites in the K-Ras oligonucleotides deserves
further comment. Although a statistically significant correlation
is observed, there are some deviations from this behavior when sequences
with the same number of TT sites are compared. For example, comparing
oligonucleotide sequences S85-91, S139-145, and S181-187 with 7 TT sites shows that sequence
S181-187 exhibits a much lower damage susceptibility
than the other two and much lower than expected from the correlation.
In fact, the damage susceptibility for S181-187 is
more closely consistent with the damage susceptibility for the closely
related sequence S183-189, which shares the last
5 condons with S181-187. Furthermore, investigating
sequences with 7 TT sites, we found that sequences that include a
guanine adjacent to TT sites give lower damage susceptibility. In
sequence-dependent studies on T<>T photodimer rates, Sarasin
et
al.31 and Kohler et al.33 have established that in tetrads of the type XTTY, the
rate of dimer formation is higher for CTTC, TTTC, TTTA, TTTT, ATTC,
CTTA, and ATTA and lower for GTTG, GTTC, GTTT, and GTTA. This model
predicts, then, that all the tetrads with Gs adjacent to a TT site
lower the rate of T<>T photodimer formation and that sequence
S181-187 with 2 GTTT tetrads would have lower damage
susceptibility, which is what is observed.

Having established
that the damage of K-Ras sequences
by UVC irradiation appears to be related to T<>T photodimer
formation,
modulated by adjacent guanines, we now similarly analyze the N-Ras gene sequences. Table 3 shows the UVC-induced damage susceptibilities for
the N-Ras sequences arranged in the order of decreasing
number of TT sites. Here, we also see a general decrease in damage
susceptibility with decreasing number of TT sites. However, we see
a few more exceptions for N-Ras than for K-Ras, which will be discussed in detail.

On comparing
sequences S37-43, S151-157, and
S169-175 with 6 TT sites, the damage susceptibility
for sequence S169-175 is much lower than that of
the other two sequences with 6 TT sites. On correlating the damage
to the neighboring nucleotides, no obvious justification could be
established for this deviation. In addition, we investigated the position
of TT sites for all the above sequences. We found that if the TT sites
are distributed throughout the dsDNA, the T<>T photodimer formation
will effectively destabilize the dsDNA more when compared to sequences
with TT sites clustered more closely together. This effect of the
distribution of TT site positions on the change in damage susceptibility
is confirmed for sequence S169-175, where all the
6 TT sites are located at the terminal and semiterminal positions24 between nucleobase number 1 and 11. Thus, hydrogen
bonding between nucleobase number 12 to 21 of the dsDNA remains unperturbed,
and this provides the required hydrophobic environment for EG to intercalate
between the nucleobases of the second half of dsDNA, contributing
to the higher fluorescence intensity. On the contrary, the 6 TT sites
in oligonucleotide sequence S37-43 are randomly
located at terminal, semiterminal, and central position of both the
strands of the dsDNA. This distribution will destabilize the dsDNA
structure throughout the entire 21 nucleobase sequence and give a
higher damage susceptibility due to the presence of more nonfluorescent
EG in solution. This result is in agreement with the earlier findings
of the significant effect of mismatch position on DNA duplex stability.24

Furthermore, comparing the N-Ras sequences with
5 TT sites (S139-145, S115-121, S85-91, S127-133, and S49-55), only sequence S139-145 gives
a high damage susceptibility (∼60%) and all the other sequences
exhibit a low damage susceptibility (20–30%). In these oligonucleotide
sequences, the presence of neighboring Gs to the TT sites does account
for the discrepancy in damage susceptibility. A detailed analysis
shows that oligonucleotide sequences S115-121 (0.32
± 0.01) and S85-91 (0.26 ± 0.02) have
GTTC tetrads and oligonucleotide sequence S127-133 (0.19 ± 0.00) contains GTTT, GTTC, and CTTG tetrads. Similarly,
oligonucleotide sequence S49-55 gives a low damage
susceptibility of 0.18 ± 0.02 and contains GTTT and GTTG tetrads.

The above predictive model is further verified by comparing the
olignucleotide sequence S85-91 of both K-Ras and N-Ras. These two sequences differ
only in the neighboring nucleobases at 1 TT site out of the 4 TT sites
present (excluding terminal TT sites with the least effect on the
apparent damage susceptibility24). The
tetrad ATTT in K-Ras sequence is replaced by GTTC
in N-Ras. Basically, replacing the adenosine of the
K-Ras tetrad with guanosine in N-Ras tetrad drops the damage susceptibility of N-Ras by ∼3 times. Thus, the quenching effect of a neighboring
G nucleobase can play a vital role in the T<>T photodimer formation
rate and the subsequent damage
susceptibility.34,35

These results for UVC-induced
DNA damage in K-Ras and N-Ras sequences
establishes an excellent agreement
between damage and the effect of neighboring gaunine nucleobase on
T<>T photodimer formation rate. This result is consistent with
the sequence dependence of T<>T damage formation observed by
Sarasin
et al.31 and Kohler et al.33 In addition, the position of TT sites has been shown to
account for the different damage susceptibilities of different K-Ras and N-Ras oligonucleotide sequences,
as well as of the genes themselves.

A potential discrepancy
in the trend of damage susceptibility is
observed for sequences with 1–4 TT sites. With more than 4
TT sites, the formation of T<>T photodimers seems to dominate
the
damage susceptibility, as discussed above. However, greater deviations
from the correlation are seen for oligonucleotide sequences with 4
or fewer TT sites. For example, oligonucleotide sequences S1-7, S49-55, and S127-133 for K-Ras and S97-103, S103-109, and S175-181 for N-Ras have
1–4 TT sites and show a damage susceptibility ranging between
30 and 65%. This could be due to the fact that UVC radiation damages
other bipyrimidine sites, such as TC, CT, and CC, to some extent.
The bipyrimidine dimer formation yields upon UVC radiation is reported
to occur in the order TT > TC > CT > CC.33 Thus, in the absence or presence of a low number of T<>T
photodimer,
there is a probability of forming other bipyrimidine photoproducts.
Sequence S1-7 of K-Ras with only
4 TT sites exhibits a damage susceptibility of 0.62 ± 0.01. This
high damage susceptibility might be attributed to the presence of
4 TC/CT sites.

From Tables 2 and 3, it is clear that the
damage susceptibility of
most K-Ras oligonucleotide sequences is larger than
their analogous N-Ras oligonucleotide sequence. Several
biological studies performed on different tumor types have confirmed
K-Ras genes to be more prone to mutation than N-Ras genes.27 The COSMIC (the
Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) data set confirms that 22%
of K-Ras genes are mutated in comparison to 8% of
N-Ras genes in all tumors analyzed.3 Consistent with the biological results, our data give a
larger damage susceptibility (∼83%) for K-Ras than for N-Ras (∼69%). This is mainly due
to the presence of the higher number of TT sites in the K-Ras gene, making them more prone to DNA damage. However,
the oligonucleotide sequences that correspond to the biologically
active codons 12, 13, and 61 did not show any remarkable UVC damage
susceptibility in either of the Ras genes. This result
is not too surprising, since UVC irradiation may not be the primary
insult to lead to oncogenic Ras genes. To understand
the role of the biologically active codons of Ras genes in further detail, more research on the biological insults
responsible for transforming the proto-oncogenes into oncogenes is
required. However, we can use our method to further explore other
types of DNA damage, such as oxidative and chemical damage, to gain
further insight into the proto-oncogene formation mechanism.

Conclusions
The different mutagenic susceptibility of K-Ras and N-Ras genes has been shown here to correlate
with molecular-level differences in UVC-induced damage susceptibility.
Parallelizing a simple and rapid mix-and-read assay using EG dye as
a fluorescence reporter and splitting the genes into shorter oligonucleotide
sequences allow us to easily specify the cause of damage due to thymine–thymine
cyclobutyl photodimers (CPDs), modulated by gaunosine residues on
either side of the TT pairs within each codon.

Experimental Section
Materials
Oligonucleotide targets were obtained from
Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Hydrochloric acid
was obtained from Anachemia (Montreal, QC, Canada), sodium chloride
was obtained from ACP Chemical Inc. (Montreal, Quebec), Tris was obtained
from ICN biomedicals (Aurora, OH), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) was obtained from BDH Inc. (Toronto, ON, Canada). The
complete sequences of K-Ras and N-Ras genes are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively (see the Supporting
Information). These genes are further subdivided into 32 overlapping
sequences, with each sequence having a length of 21 nucleobases (Table 1).

DNA Damage
Induced by UV Radiation
For DNA damage experiments,
147 μL of 1.36 μM nitrogen-purged dsDNA samples of each
target sequence mentioned in Table 1 was placed in a separate well of a 96-well plate (Corning
Special Optics, NY). UV light from UVC lamps emitting at 254 nm was
chosen for irradiation. The UVC lamps in a Luzchem (Ottawa, ON, Canada)
DEV photoreactor were turned on for 20 min prior to the experiment
to ensure a stabilized light source. The photoreactor was purged continuously
with nitrogen to remove oxygen and minimize ozone generation from
the lamp. Finally, the 96-well microplate was placed in the photoreactor.
Each well of the 96-well microplate was exposed to UVC light continuously
for 2 h. Control samples were handled under identical condition, but
were not exposed to UVC light and kept in the dark. After irradiation,
the 96-well microplates were removed from the photoreactor and EG
dye was added to each well. The final concentrations of the dsDNA
and EG dye were a fixed ratio of 1:1.33.

Fluorescence Measurements
Room-temperature EvaGreen
fluorescence intensities for UV-exposed dsDNA solutions were measured
using a Safire fluorescence plate reader (Tecan, Mannendorf, Switzerland)
after the addition of EG dye followed by incubation at 37 °C
for 20 min in the dark. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded
using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength
of 530 nm. The fluorescence spectra of dsDNA alone gave a minimum
or zero background at the 530 nm emission wavelength.
