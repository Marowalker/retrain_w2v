We report a simple,
rapid, and scalable strategy to fabricate surfaces
exhibiting in-air superoleophobic/superhydrophilic wetting via sequential
spray deposition and photopolymerization of nanoparticle-laden thiol–acrylate
resins comprising both hydrophilic and oleophobic chemical constituents.
The combination of spray deposition with nanoparticles provides hierarchical
surface morphologies with both micro- and nanoscale roughness. Mapping
the wetting behavior as a function of resin composition using high-
and low-surface-tension liquid probes enabled facile identification
of coatings that exhibit a range of wetting behavior, including superhydrophilic/superoleophilic,
superhydrophobic/superoleophobic, and in-air superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
wetting. In-air superhydrophilic/superoleophobic wetting was realized
by a dynamic rearrangement of the interface to expose a greater fraction
of hydrophilic moieties in response to contact with water. We show
that these in-air superoleophobic/superhydrophilic coatings deposited
onto porous supports enable separation of model oil–water emulsions
with separation efficiencies up to 99.9% with 699 L·m–2 h–1 permeate flux when the superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
coatings are paired with 0.45 μm nylon membrane supports.

Introduction
Surface engineering strategies enabling
the design of surfaces
with special wetting properties—particularly superhydrophobic/superoleophilic
and superhydrophilic/superoleophobic surfaces—have garnered
significant attention for the oil–water separation processes
for environmental cleanup, industrial wastewater treatment, and fuel
decontamination.1−5 Superhydrophobic/superoleophilic surfaces have been broadly explored
as separation membranes that function on the premise of “oil
removal”—a process requiring selective wetting of the
surface by the low-surface-tension fluid to partition the oil and
water phases.6−13 However, oils readily foul these oleophilic surfaces, decreasing
both flux and separation efficiency. Additionally, the higher density
of water compared with most oils leads to a water barrier layer between
the oil and the membrane, which hinders the separation process and
often requires special engineering of the separation apparatus. In
contrast, superhydrophilic/superoleophobic surfaces partition the
oil and water phases based on the premise of “water removal”,
in which water selectively wets the surface and permeates through
the membrane but oil is rejected. Such a design lowers the propensity
of the surface being fouled by the oil phase and enables a gravity-driven
separation process. Most separation membranes based on “water-removal”
processes have relied on the design of superhydrophilic surfaces that
exhibit underwater superoleophobicity and have been fabricated from
a broad range of materials including zwitterionic polymers, hydrogels,
and graphene oxide.14−21 Superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic surfaces often exhibit
high oil–water separation efficiencies and low fouling; however,
the design requires the membrane to be prewet with water prior to
the separation process to avoid fouling.22,23

Surfaces exhibiting in-air superhydrophilicity and superoleophobicity
are challenging to design—requiring an interface that simultaneously
exhibits a surface energy higher than water and lower than oil. Thus,
in practice, surfaces exhibiting both wetting properties simultaneously
in air are rare, as superoleophobic surfaces generally exhibit superhydrophobicity.
The relatively few papers that have described the fabrication of superhydrophilic/in-air
superoleophobic surfaces exploit a stimuli-responsive rearrangement
of the material interface.24−32 In 2012, Yang et al. reported a seminal approach to achieve superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
wetting based on molecular rearrangement of interfaces comprising
both hydrophilic and oleophobic chemical compositions.25 Yang et al. reported the design of a superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
nanocomposite film fabricated by spray-casting silica nanoparticle/diallyldimethylammonium
perfluorooctanoate solutions. Molecular rearrangement of the cationic
and perfluoro groups at the interface enabled a transition from superhydrophobic/superoleophobic
to superhydrophilic/superoleophobic wetting behavior; however, the
timescale for this transition was slow, requiring up to 9 min for
the initial water contact angle (WCA) to decrease from 150° to
0°. The transition timescale could be significantly decreased
by plasma treating the surface, without extensively influencing the
superoleophobicity. Similarly, Kota et al. reported hygro-responsive
superhydrophilic/superoleophobic membranes based on cross-linked poly(ethylene
glycol) containing fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane
(POSS).24 Again, reorganization of the
hydrophilic and oleophobic groups at the interface gave rise to superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
membranes, where the timescale of the wetting transition was dependent
on the concentration of POSS and the substrate type. For example,
spin-coated silicon substrates and dip-coated wire-mesh substrates
containing 20 wt % fluorodecyl POSS underwent surface reconfiguration
in contact with water transitioning from a hydrophobic/superoleophobic
state to a superhydrophilic/superoleophobic wetting state in less
than 2.5 min, whereas coated textiles required up to 20 min for this
transition. Kota employed these mesh membranes for separation of a
range of oil–water mixtures with up to 99.9% separation efficiency
without prewetting the membrane. Similarly, Pan and co-workers fluorinated
the surface of cotton textiles with (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)triethoxysilane
to achieve superhydrophilic/superoleophobic wetting.31 The superoleophobic wetting behavior was attributed to
the fluorinated re-entrant morphology of the textile fibers, whereas
superhydrophilicity was ascribed to reorganization of the cellulose
chains in response to contact with polar liquids. These modified textiles
were employed as efficient membranes for oil–water separations.
Other approaches have included UV-light33 and ammonia-triggered28 transitions to
achieve the superhydrophilic/superoleophobic wetting state. These
examples illustrate simple strategies for the design of in-air superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
surfaces based on synergistic interactions of interfacial chemistry,
hierarchical roughness, and dynamic interfacial rearrangement. The
details of other examples have been highlighted in several recent
review articles.2−4

In a previous work, we demonstrated the fabrication
of superhydrophobic34 and superamphiphobic35 coatings via spray deposition and photopolymerization
of nanoparticle-laden
thiol–ene resins. Herein, we describe a simple strategy to
fabricate in-air superhydrophilic/superoleophobic surfaces by spray-coating
nanoparticle-laden thiol–acrylate resins, resulting in hierarchically
rough interfaces exhibiting both hydrophilic and oleophobic chemical
constituents. Hydrophilic contributions at the material interface
were achieved using 2-carboxyethyl acrylate, poly(ethyl glycol)diacrylate,
and fumed silica nanoparticles, whereas oleophobic contributions were
incorporated using a 1H,1H-perfluoro-n-decyl-modified multifunctional thiol. Composition versus
wettability maps were used to identify surfaces with a range of wetting
properties, including surfaces that display in-air superoleophobicity
in contact with oil but rapidly transition (<10 s) to a superhydrophilic
wetting state in contact with water via molecular rearrangement of
the interface. A variety of porous substrates were coated with the
superhydrophilic/superoleophobic resin and were employed for efficient
separation of oil–water mixtures and oil–water emulsions.

Results
and Discussion
Resin Formulation, Film Fabrication, and
Surface Morphology
Thiol–acrylate photopolymerization
was employed to fabricate
coatings exhibiting both superhydrophilic and superoleophobic wetting
properties. As shown in Scheme 1, photopolymer resins were formulated with 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone
(DMPA) as a photoinitiator, poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate and 2-carboxyethyl
acrylate as hydrophilic monomers (1:10 wt ratio), and 1H,1H-perfluoro-n-decyl-functionalized
pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate) (F-PETMP) as an oleophobic
resin constituent (20–50 wt % relative to the total acrylate
resin). Thiol–acrylate photopolymerizations proceed via a dual-mode
process involving simultaneous step-growth and chain-growth mechanisms.36 Resins containing a 1:1 ratio of thiol to acrylate
typically yield incomplete polymer networks with residual thiol functionality
in the polymer matrix. Thus, to achieve high conversion of both acrylate
and thiol functional groups, we explored resins formulated with excess
acrylate. The molar ratios of the acrylate group to the thiol group
were calculated as 13.7:1 (20 wt % F-PETMP), 8:1 (30 wt % F-PETMP),
6.8:1 (40 wt % F-PETMP), and 4.9:1 (50 wt % F-PETMP). Raman spectroscopy
was used to investigate the photopolymerization behavior of the thiol–acrylate
resins as a function of increasing the F-PETMP concentration. Figure 1a shows the series
of Raman spectra for thiol–acrylate resins containing 20–50
wt % F-PETMP before exposure to UV light. The thiol (2569 cm–1) and alkene (1634 cm–1) peaks are highlighted
in yellow and blue, respectively. Figure 1b shows the Raman spectra of the thiol–acrylate
formulations after UV exposure. The acrylate group proceeded to high
conversion in all the formulations as evidenced by the total disappearance
of the characteristic peak at 1634 cm–1. The thiol
group, however, showed conversions that were dependent on the F-PETMP
loading level. As shown in Figure 1c, thiol conversion decreased with increasing F-PETMP
content because of the competing reactions of acrylate homopolymerization
and thiol–acrylate step-growth polymerization. At 20 and 30
wt % F-PETMP loading levels, thiol conversion was ∼96.6%, which
indicates that the thiol functional groups were mostly consumed in
the step-growth process. When F-PETMP was increased to 50 wt %, the
conversion of thiol decreased to ∼83.6%, indicative of the
competitive chain-growth and step-growth processes. The polymerization
behavior observed herein is consistent with other reports involving
thiol–acrylate photopolymerizations.37,38

Scheme 1 Spray-Deposition and Photopolymerization Process Using
Hybrid Inorganic–Organic
Thiol–Acrylate Resins Laden with Hydrophilic Silica Nanoparticles
Next, fumed silica nanoparticles
were added into the resin at various
loading levels (30–60 wt % relative to the resin). To simplify
the notation for each system, we will represent the various formulations
as F-PETMP(x)/SiO2(y),
where x and y represent the weight
percentage of F-PETMP and SiO2, respectively. The resins
were formulated by diluting the constituents with acetone and homogenizing
the mixture with ultrasonication. The resins were then spray-coated
onto various substrates (e.g., glass, wire-mesh, cotton-textile, and
nylon membranes) using a simple airbrush device and cured under UV
light as previously reported.34,35 The spray-deposition
method provides a simple route to endow the thiol–acrylate
coating with the hierarchical roughness necessary to achieve the desired
superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and superoleophobic wetting behavior.
The surface morphology of the spray-coated and photocured thiol–acrylate
films was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 2a shows the SEM image
of the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) sample at a low magnification.
The surface exhibits a similar morphology to our earlier work, with
randomly distributed micrometer and sub-micrometer agglomerations
that can be attributed to the spray-deposition process. The higher
magnification image (Figure 2b) clearly shows that the micrometer scale aggregates are
superimposed with a nanometer-scale roughness that arises from the
fumed silica aggregates. The combination of micro- and sub-micrometer-sized
particles endows the surface with a porous, hierarchically structured
morphology. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was used
to explore the elemental surface composition of the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) sample. As shown in Figure 2c, the surface was primarily composed of
F, S, Si, C, and O elements. The presence of sulfur and silicon in
the EDS originates from the trifunctional thiol and fumed silica nanoparticles,
respectively. The fluorine content of the cured film obtained from
EDS was 8.78 ± 0.13 wt %, whereas the fluorine content calculated
from the bulk resin composition for F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50)
was 5.33 wt %. The higher F content observed by EDS is indicative
of surface enrichment of the low-surface-energy F-PETMP component,
and is consistent with previous observations using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy.35 Further, the EDS elemental
mapping of F, S, and Si indicated that all elements were well distributed
across the surface of the coating.

Wetting Behavior
The wetting properties of the films
were evaluated via contact angle measurements. Hexadecane (γ
= 27 mN/m) and deionized water (γ = 72.4 mN/m) were used as
the probe liquids for oil contact angle (OCA) and WCA measurements,
respectively. Figure 3a shows the wetting behavior of the nontextured (e.g., excluding
silica nanoparticles from the formulation and spin-casting to smooth
films on glass substrates) photocured films containing 0–50
wt % of F-PETMP. Here, it is necessary to mention that the WCA on
many of these surfaces changed with time (as discussed below); thus,
WCAs were consistently recorded 60 s after placing the droplet in
contact with the surface. The OCAs did not show time-dependent behavior.
As expected, the nonfluorinated film was completely wetted by both
hexadecane (OCA = 4.6 ± 0.9°) and water (WCA = 8.6 ±
0.8°) because of the absence of a low-surface-energy component
and the hydrophilic nature of the acidic acrylate resin. Incorporation
of 20 wt % F-PETMP resulted in films with hydrophilic WCA (24.6 ±
0.6°), indicating a strong contribution from the polar carboxylic
acid groups in the resin. Further increasing the concentration of
F-PETMP resulted in transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic wetting
behavior, with the WCA increasing from 85.1 ± 0.5° at 30
wt % F-PETMP to 113.8 ± 0.8° at 50 wt % F-PETMP. An example
of the time-dependent wetting of water on the film containing 30 wt
% F-PETMP is illustrated in Figure 3b. The time-dependent wetting arises from
rearrangement of the carboxylic acid and fluorocarbon moieties at
the contact interface; however, the time scale for the changes in
the WCA is longer on the nontextured surface when compared to the
hierarchically rough surfaces described below. In contrast, the OCA
increased to 75.5 ± 0.7° with 20 wt % F-PETMP but showed
only a small change in the OCA with further additions of F-PETMP (30–50
wt %) to the resin. This observation can be attributed to the saturation
of the 1H,1H-perfluoro-n-decyl-functional groups at the film surface—a result consistent
with our previous work with F-PETMP.35

(black line) and OCA (blue line) change with the variation
of F-PETMP content of nontextured films. The inserted images are representative
photographs of water and oil droplets (6 μL) on the nontextured
surfaces. (b) Time-dependent wetting of water on the F-PETMP(30) surface.

With insights into the wetting
properties of nontextured films,
we next investigated the wetting behavior of the same resin compositions
containing silica nanoparticles deposited onto glass substrates via
spray deposition, where the hierarchical roughness of the surface
is expected to significantly influence the wetting and antiwetting
characteristics of the surface. In these experiments, the SiO2 nanoparticle content was varied from 30 to 60 wt % relative
to the total weight of the resin, whereas the F-PETMP concentration
was varied from 20 to 50 wt % relative to the acrylate. Figure 4a,b shows the WCA and OCA,
respectively, as a function of the SiO2 nanoparticle and
the F-PETMP loading levels. Specific values for the contact and sliding
angles are given in Table 1. From the detailed wetting/composition maps in Figure 4, the compositions can be identified
to design surfaces that balance the contributions from the high-surface-energy
carboxylic acid and silanol functional groups with contributions from
the low-surface-energy fluorocarbon groups to achieve a range of desired
wetting behavior. For example, the films fabricated without F-PETMP
exhibited low contact angles (<5°) for both water and oil
as the SiO2 content changed from 30 to 60 wt %—observations
that are associated with superhydrophilic and superoleophilic wetting
behavior. The superhydrophilic/superoleophilic wetting behavior is
demonstrated in Figure 4c, where vegetable oil, hexadecane, and water are observed to completely
wet the F-PETMP(0)/SiO2(50) surface. At the other extreme
in composition, the films containing 40–50 wt % F-PETMP exhibited
WCA–OCAs ranging from 104°/140° when loaded with
30 wt % SiO2 to 156°/157° when loaded with 60
wt % SiO2—characteristic behavior that approaches
superhydrophobic and superoleophobic wetting, as demonstrated in Figure 4c. Notably, the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) surface exhibited a WCA of 0°, an OCA of 155.6 ±
1°, and a 10 ± 1° oil sliding angle (OSA) indicative
of the desired superhydrophilic and superoleophobic wetting behavior.
The in-air superhydrophilic/superoleophobic wetting behavior of the
F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) film is illustrated in Figure 4c, where vegetable oil and
hexadecane interact with the surface with OCAs greater than 150°,
whereas water completely wets the surface. We postulate that the composition
of the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) film strikes an appropriate
balance between carboxylic acid and fluorocarbon moieties, enabling
a dynamic rearrangement of the interface to expose a greater fraction
of COOH groups in response to contact with water; rearrangement results
in a fully wetted interface. Similarly, fluorocarbon moieties are
preferentially presented at the interface in response to contact with
a low-surface-tension liquid, resulting in a nonwetted interface.
As reported by others, the rearrangement of the interface is not instantaneous.24,25,39 The dynamic nature of the wetting
process with water can be observed as a function of time. As illustrated
in Figure 4d, a water
droplet initially interacts with the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50)
surface with a finite contact angle (57.2 ± 1°), but transitions
rapidly (<10 s) to a fully wetted state with a 0° contact
angle. This transition time is relatively fast in comparison to that
of some materials reported in the literature, particularly considering
that no additional processing steps were required.24,25 However, it is important to note that the transition time appears
to be highly dependent on multiple parameters (composition, crystallinity,
substrate, etc.), making direct comparisons across the literature
difficult.

Lastly, based on the observed in-air wetting behavior of the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) surface, we can expect these surfaces to also exhibit
underwater superoleophobicity. Thus, the underwater oil-wetting behavior
of the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) film was examined. Contact
angle measurements were obtained underwater using a series of low-surface-tension
liquids, including hexadecane, hexane, silicone oil, vegetable oil,
chloroform, and trichloroethane. As shown in Figure 4e, the spray-coated F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) film exhibited underwater OCAs larger than 150° for each
oil, confirming an underwater superoleophobic wetting behavior. Furthermore,
these oil droplets showed low sliding angles (<1°) in the
underwater environment, indicating minimal adhesion between the oil
droplets and the surface.

Oil–Water Separation
The
superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) resin was selected for the fabrication
of oil–water separation membranes. The F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) coatings were fabricated via spray deposition on a series
of substrates serving as supports for the composite separation membrane,
including stainless-steel mesh (200 mesh size), cotton cloth, and
nylon filters (0.8 and 0.45 μm pore size). SEM images of the
F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) coating on the various supports are
shown in Figure 5a–c.
The spray-deposition process provided conformal, hierarchically rough
coatings on the strands of the stainless-steel mesh (Figure 5a) and the fibers comprising
the cotton textile (Figure 5b) without blocking the inherent microporosity of these substrates.
Similarly, the process yields a conformal F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) coating on the 0.45 μm nylon membrane, as shown in the
cross-sectional image in Figure 5c. Initially, we evaluated the composite membranes
for the separation of surfactant-free hexane and water mixtures. Figure 5d shows the simple
apparatus, consisting of the composite membranes sandwiched between
the upper and lower pieces of a glass filtration device, employed
for gravity-driven separations. The water layer was dyed pink with
sulforhodamine B to improve the visibility of the separation process.
The hexane–water mixtures were mechanically agitated and then
poured into a glass funnel. Because of the in-air superoleophobicity
and rapid transition to a superhydrophilic wetting state upon contact
with water, prewetting the membrane with water was unnecessary. As
shown, water passed through the membrane driven by gravity, whereas
hexane was rejected by the membrane and remained in the separation
funnel. The calculated separation efficiencies, shown in Figure 5f, were greater than
98% for each composite membrane investigated.

cross section image for clarity). (d) Photographs of the simple, gravity-driven
apparatus employed for oil–water separation. (f) Separation
efficiency for surfactant-free oil–water mixtures.

Oil-in-water emulsions are more commonly encountered
in the treatment
of industrial wastewater and in environmental cleanup scenarios, where
a surfactant typically results in the oil being dispersed as small
droplets within the aqueous phase.40 For
separation of emulsions, we focused attention on F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) coatings supported by the nylon membrane with 0.45 and
0.8 μm pore sizes. A hexadecane-in-water emulsion stabilized
using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the surfactant (hydrophilic–lipophilic
balance = 40) was employed as a model feed. The same separation apparatus
was used as previously described, except that a negative pressure
(−30 kPa) was applied to the collection flask. Figure 6a shows photographs of the
hexadecane-in-water emulsion feed before and after separation using
the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50)-coated membranes. Before separation,
emulsions consisted of droplets ranging in size from hundreds of nanometers
to tens of micrometers, as exemplified by confocal imaging of the
hexadecane/Nile red feed in Figure 6b. After separation, the presence of droplets in the
collected filtrate was difficult to discern by confocal microscopy.
To determine the separation efficiency, the concentration of hexadecane
in water was determined using UV–vis spectroscopy (λ
= 574 nm for Nile red/hexadecane), as shown in Figure 6c. The separation efficiencies and flux values
are shown in Figure 6d. The separation efficiencies for the uncoated 0.8 and 0.45 μm
nylon supports were 84.7 and 89.1%, respectively. In general, decreasing
the pore size of the membrane support resulted in an improved separation
efficiency; however, the flux decreased from 1868 L·m–2 h–1 for the 0.8 μm membrane to 1277 L·m–2 h–1 for the 0.45 μm membrane.
Although separation of the hexadecane-in-water emulsion could be achieved
using the uncoated membranes, these membranes were readily fouled
by the oil-in-water emulsion. As shown, coating the nylon supports
with the F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) coating improved the separation
efficiencies. The F-PETMP(30)/SiO2(50) coating on the 0.45
μm nylon substrate provided the best separation performance,
yielding a 99.9% efficiency for the hexadecane-in-water emulsion.
However, the increase in separation efficiency is achieved at the
expense of the permeate flux. For example, the flux decreased from
1343 L·m–2 h–1 for separation
of the hexadecane-in-water on the 0.8 μm nylon support to 699
L·m–2 h–1 when using the
0.45 μm nylon support. These separation efficiencies and flux
values are comparable to the performance of a broad range of separation
membranes reported in the literature.1

Conclusions
In this paper, we have
demonstrated a quick and simple approach
to fabricate superhydrophilic/superoleophobic coatings via spray deposition
and UV photopolymerization of perfluorinated thiol/acidic acrylate
resins containing hydrophilic silica nanoparticles. The spray-deposition
method of the nanoparticle-laden resins provided coatings with hierarchically
rough morphologies on a broad range of substrates. Resin composition
versus wettability mapping using high- and low-surface-tension liquid
probes enabled facile identification of coatings that exhibit a range
of wetting behavior, including superhydrophilicity/superoleophilicity,
superhydrophobicity/superoleophobicity, and in-air superhydrophilicity/superoleophobicity.
The superhydrophilic/superoleophobic coatings were evaluated as membranes
for separation of oil-in-water mixtures and oil-in-water emulsions.
Separation efficiencies up to 99.9% with 699 L·m–2 h–1 permeate flux were achieved when the superhydrophilic/superoleophobic
coatings were paired with 0.45 μm nylon membrane supports. A
salient feature of the fabrication process is scalability to large-area
substrates. We anticipate that simplicity and scalability of the fabrication
process and the efficiency of oil–water separations will lead
to broad applications of these membranes for the treatment of oil
spills and industrial wastewater streams.

from Bruno Bock. F-PETMP was synthesized according to the literature.41 Aerosil R380, hydrophilic fumed silica with
a hydroxyl surface and an average primary particle size of 16 nm was
kindly provided by Evonik Industries.

Characterization
Contact angle measurements were performed
using a Rame-Hart 200-00 Std.-Tilting B. goniometer. Static contact
angles were measured using 6 μL water droplets. ImageJ Drop
Analysis was used to analyze the droplets. SEM images were obtained
using a Zeiss Sigma VP FEG-SEM at 10 kV in high-vacuum mode. Raman
spectroscopy was conducted using an iRaman Plus. The thiol conversion
was monitored by measuring the area of the thiol absorption peak at
2576 cm–1. Conversions were calculated with the
ratio of the peak area to the peak area prior to polymerization. All
reactions were performed under ambient conditions. Transmission electron
micrographs (TEMs) (Digital Imaging with Gatan model 785 ES1000W Erlangshen
CCD Camera) were taken with a Zeiss 900 TEM operating at 50 kV. UV–vis
spectra were obtained by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV–vis
spectrometer. Optical microscope images were obtained by using an
Olympus BX52 digital optical microscope system. Dynamic light scattering
analysis was conducted using a Microtrac Nanotrac Ultra. Confocal
images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning
microscope with a 543 nm HeNe laser.

Film Preparation
Thiol–acrylate-based hybrid
resins were prepared by weighing out a trifunctional thiol (F-PETMP),
hydrophilic alkene (2-carboxyethyl acrylate), cross-linker poly(ethyl
glycol)diacrylate 400, and DMPA (5 wt %) into a glass jar. A specified
amount of hydrophilic silica nanoparticles (SiO2, Aerosil
R380 = 30, 40, 50, 60 wt % relative to the resin) was added to the
resin mixture. For the formulations containing F-PETMP, the functional
monomer (F-PETMP) was added at 0, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wt % relative
to the total organic resin, which gave the stoichiometric ratio of
alkene to thiol of 13.7:1, 8:1, 6.8:1, and 4.9:1 accordingly. The
hybrid mixture was diluted in acetone (20:1 w/w solvent/resin) and
then treated with bath ultrasonication (Fisher Scientific Ultrasonic
Cleaner) for 30 min. An air brush with a nozzle diameter of 0.635
mm (Paasch H#3 obtained from McMaster Carr) was connected to a compressed
nitrogen source (30 psi) and used to spray-coat the resin onto substrates
at a distance of 15 cm and at a rate of 2 mL/min. Different substrates
were sprayed, including glass slides, stainless-steel mesh with 200
mesh size, cotton cloth, and nylon filter membranes with either a
0.8 or a 0.45 μm pore size. The coating was allowed to sit for
1 min before curing under a UV flood lamp (16 mW/cm2) for
5 min.

Preparation and Separation of Oil-in-Water Mixtures and Emulsions
A surfactant-free oil–water mixture was prepared by mechanically
mixing a 1:1 volume ratio of hexane and water. The aqueous phase was
dyed with sulforhodamine B to improve the visibility during the separation
process. Thiol–acrylate coatings on the stainless-steel mesh,
cotton-cloth, or nylon filters served as the composite separation
membrane. A simple separation apparatus was employed consisting of
the composite membrane sandwiched between the upper and lower pieces
of a glass vacuum filtration device. Separations of the surfactant-free
oil–water mixtures were gravity-driven. The separation efficiency
(E) of the surfactant-free oil–water mixtures
was calculated using the following equation: E %
= Wp/Wo at
100%, where Wo and Wp represent the weight of the water phase before and after
separation, respectively. Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by
ultrasonicating a mixture of water (500 g), hexadecane (5 g), Nile
red (10 mg), and SDS (1.2 g). Oil-in-water emulsions were separated
with a negative pressure (−30 kPa) applied to the collection
flask. The separation efficiency of oil-in-water emulsions was determined
according to a literature method.42 The
oil rejection coefficient (R) was calculated using
the following equation: R % = (Co – Cp)/Co×/100%, where Co and Cp represent the oil concentration in the original
oil-in-water emulsion and the aqueous filtrate, respectively. The
oil concentration was determined using UV–vis spectroscopy
(λ = 574 nm for Nile red/hexadecane). The permeate flux was
calculated according to the following equation: flux = V/S·t, where V is the volume of water separated per unit of time, S is the active membrane area in contact with the oil-in-water emulsion,
and t is time.
