In the present study,
natural polyamine spermine is demonstrated
as a potential basic catalyst for glucose-to-fructose isomerization.
For instance, spermine achieves a decent fructose yield (30% wt) and
selectivity (74%) during the single-step aqueous phase isomerization
under the modest operating conditions (100 °C for 15 min). In
addition to the expected reaction byproduct monosugar mannose, spermine
also assists in the synthesis of rare and important monosugar, that
is, psicose up to 4% wt. Psicose is a zero calorie rare sugar, exhibits
a low caloric value, and possesses anti-adipogenic property. A comparative
study involving other polyamines concluded that the presence of 20 amines tends to exhibit the most significant impact in improving
the target product yield by releasing a higher number of OH– ions, which are responsible for isomerization through the formation
of an enediol anion. An attempt was made to further improve the fructose
yield through the addition of neutral salts, but it promoted a meager
achievement. In an alternate study, a selective extraction strategy
was followed for the isolation of fructose from the reaction mixture.
The employed aryl monoboronic acid remarkably improved the net fructose
concentration, that is, fructose productivity up to 75% wt (cumulative)
and 70% selectivity within three consecutive extractions and isomerization
cycles, which is comparatively three times shorter than that reported
in the literature. Notably, spermine itself provided the essential
and necessary basic environment for selective fructose extraction
and glucose isomerization, ruling out the use of any external reagents
and thus establishing itself as a versatile material suitable for
a typical isomerization reaction in an upscaled reactor.

Introduction
The isomerization of
glucose to fructose is prioritized as an essential
reaction in the food and beverage industries for the production of
high fructose syrup, which is frequently used in the preparation of
a variety of food products.1,2 Among all the naturally
occurring sugars, fructose has the highest relative sweetness and
at the same time has the lowest glycemic index. In recent years, the
significance of this reaction is widely recognized in the field of
lignocellulose-derived sugar (glucose) conversion to liquid biofuel
precursor synthesis, including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid, levulinic acid, and 2,5-dimethylfuran, wherein fructose serves
as the essential intermediate compound as it has more reactivity than
the initial glucose (reactant) for the subsequent dehydration reactions
and is easier to convert into versatile platform chemicals.2−4 However, reversible reaction feature, thermodynamic product degradation,
equilibrium between glucose and fructose sugars, and unwanted and/or
uncontrolled side reactions are the typical constraints of the reaction.2 Till date, the fructose yield close to the thermodynamic
equilibrium (up to 42% wt and 80% selectivity) has been achieved only
by enzyme-assisted catalysis (glucose isomerase) and is widely employed
for the commercial level production of fructose. However, this method
suffers from serious drawbacks, including expensive enzymes, prolonged
reaction, irreversible deactivation, the addition of buffers as a
reaction supplement, and so forth.5,6 Alternatively,
intensive investigations have been undertaken by the researchers to
develop an efficient chemo-catalyst system for the isomerization reaction.
In view of establishing a low-cost technique and faster and safer
post-synthetic reaction, most studies recommended the Lewis acids
or base catalysis for the glucose isomerization in the aqueous phase.
However, the performance of those chemo-catalysts is slightly lower
than the classical enzymatic conversion in terms of the product yield
(averagely 30–40% wt).2,6 Also, the Lewis acid
and Brønsted base-catalyzed isomerization accommodates the uncontrolled
side reaction, forming unwanted products, including humins and other
organic acids which negatively impacts the target product synthesis.
For example, recent studies have introduced organic amines like basic
amino acids,7 polyethyleneimine (PEI),8 and trimethylamine9 as a potential basic catalyst for glucose conversion that resulted
in a better product concentration (30–35% wt and 60–75%
selectivity), which is comparatively higher than the traditional Brønsted
base isomerization, that is, typically 10–36% wt and 40–73%
selectivity.7 Furthermore, the kinetic
and mechanistic investigations of the organic amine-catalyzed glucose
isomerization reactions disclosed that those followed the typical
Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda van Ekenstein (LdB–AvE) rearrangement
mechanism, where the C-2 proton on the acyclic glucose is abstracted
by the base, resulting in the formation of a 1,2-enediol intermediate,
followed by a proton shift from O-2 to O-1 and protonation of C-1
for the formation of fructose. Hydroxide (OH–) ions
generated after the protonation of lone pair of nitrogen atoms in
the amines proved to be the most influencing species rather than amine
groups for favorable glucose transformation reactions.10 Of course, the basicity of amines is not only
dependent upon the electron releasing (+I) effect of the substituted
alkyl or aryl group but also on other critical factors like steric
and hydration effects. Based on these conclusive factors, secondary
(20) amines can be considered more basic than primary (10) and tertiary (30) amines and can influence higher
glucose conversion.8−11 The above fact is evidenced in the literature, wherein 33–36%
fructose yield with 66–77% selectivity was achieved in the
presence of PEI consisting a higher number of 20 amines
than 10 and 30 in the mere aqueous medium.8 Not surprisingly, the organic amine-based catalysis
is accompanied by undesired byproducts, such as N-substituted glycosylamine
via reaction with sugars, so called Maillard reaction.2

In the present study, we investigated the potential
use of amine-type
organic base catalysts such as spermine, spermidine, cadaverine, and
diethylenetriamine, a class of biologically active polyamines, in
the glucose-to-fructose aqueous phase isomerization reaction. Chemical
structure, nature of the amine groups (primary, secondary, and tertiary
amines), and pKa are the major factors
that affect amine catalyst activity. Among these chemical catalysts,
spermine is of particular interest, it is one of the three major polyamines
present in plant species and is an essential constituent of eukaryotic
and prokaryotic cells and has been extensively employed as a low-cost
and eco-friendly catalyst in the production of value-added chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, polymers, and pesticides.12 Structurally, it is a linear aliphatic polyamine in a zig-zag fashion
consisting of 20 amines in the center and two pendant 10 amine groups on the edge. The role of the amines is to generate
a hydroxide ion necessary to catalyze the isomerization reaction.
Based on the comprehensive studies using different polyamines, the
structural architecture and pKa values
could significantly influence the basicity of the reaction medium.8−11

In recent years, efforts are being made to overcome the unfavorable
aldose-to-ketose conversion equilibrium for achieving higher productivity,
for example, sequential selective extraction of fructose and isomerization
strategy, wherein fructose forms complexes with active binding agents
like lipophilic aryl boronic acids. Till date, numerous studies have
used boron acids and its derivatives, including phenylboronic acid
(PBA), naphthalene-2-boronic acid (NBA), ortho-hydroxymethyl
phenylboronic acid, and ortho-dimethyl-aminomethyl
phenylboronic acid, because it has the tendency to form more stable
complexes preferably with ketoses over aldoses, thereby providing
the opportunity for aldose–ketose separation during the isomerization
reaction.13 One such example is that up
to 72% of fructose extraction with 76% selectivity could be achieved
using PBA as an extraction agent under optimized conditions from a
glucose-fructose mixture. Similarly, ∼89% fructose was extracted
using NBA with 90% purity through the back-extraction technique during
the preparation of 5-HMF from glucose.14 Over the past decade, this technique has been popularly used for
sensing of monosaccharides in biological systems because boronic acids
are ideal molecular receptors, predominantly for cis-1,2- or 1,3-diols (e.g., glucose, fructose, and xylose). Moreover,
it rapidly and reversibly interacts with carbohydrates present in
the aqueous medium under only basic conditions, preferably at pH ≥
8. On the basis of the tendency of spermine to create basicity while
reacting with water, we speculate that polyamine can offer versatile
performances like maintaining basic condition favorable for glucose
isomerization and fructose extraction in the presence of boronic acids
through the compensation of OH– ions and thus may
provide a breakthrough in the glucose–fructose isomerization
reaction.

Results and Discussion
Spermine-Catalyzed Glucose-To-Fructose Isomerization
Several comprehensive studies have substantiated the mechanism
of
glucose transformation to fructose under basic solutions that it first
involves the formation of a 1,2-enediol intermediate which prompts
the aldose protonation at the C-2 position and the ketose protonation
at the C-1 position.10 Relative studies
often advice that it is not easy to find clear correlations between
the structural properties and catalytic performance of organic amines.
Therefore, the study was limited to optimize the process parameters,
such as catalyst dose, temperature, reaction time, and addition of
neutral salts to achieve maximum fructose productivity. The various
physicochemical properties of spermine including miscibility in water
and alcohol solvents, melting point 30 °C (solid form at room
temperature), and boiling point 150 °C are required for a typical
reaction. Naturally, it consists of both 10 (two at the
sides) and 20 amines (two in the middle), as displayed
in Figure S1, and the respective pKa values of its conjugated acids are estimated
to be 10.1–10.9 (10) and 7.9–8.4 (20), respectively. Consequently, the effect of the catalyst dose (spermine)
to the isomerization reaction was studied within 2 to 18% mol range
at four equal intervals. The pH0 of the reaction mixture
prior to the addition of the catalyst was observed to be 7.5. The
results obtained with the corresponding incremented dosage levels
of spermine inferred that it had a detrimental effect on fructose
productivity. For instance, an increasing fashion of response was
achieved up to the optimum, that is, 6% mol dose, yielding a 29% wt
fructose yield, and 76% selectivity and further incremented dosages
resulted in a relatively 13% lower yield and 26% selectivity (Figure S2). The possible reason for the decrease
in the fructose yield with an increased dose of spermine could be
due to the higher basicity generated through the release of more OH– ions which in turn could thermally degrade the fructose
in the glucose transformation reaction at 90 °C for 15 min.15 Moreover, the consistently increasing result
of glucose conversion, that is, averagely 41% at each intermittently
increased loadings of the catalyst suggested that the isomerization
reaction was accompanied by an uncontrolled as well as irreversible
sugar degradation under harsh conditions and led to the formation
of unwanted side products (e.g., formic, acetic, glycolic, and lactic
acid) and condensation products (like humins). These side products
can be excluded from the scope of the work because of the determination
complications. Additionally, the change in color of the reaction medium
from pale yellow to deep brown during the course of the reaction indicated
that the typical Maillard reaction was proceeded due to the interface
between amines and reducing sugar and produced the N-substituted glycosylamine
under basic conditions, as displayed in Figure S3. The results obtained were in good agreement with the literature
reports.7,8,16 It is interesting
to notice that spermine also assisted in the synthesis of pseudofructose
(psicose) to the extent of up to 4% wt along with the usual byproduct
mannose (up to 5% wt) (Table 1). The LdB–AvE rearrangement mechanism also postulated
that the monosugars mannose and psicose could form simultaneously
through the dissimilar enolization rearrangement mechanisms like the
former via the cis-1,2-enediolization mechanism through
glucose and the latter via the cis-2,3-enediolization
mechanism through fructose under mild alkaline conditions.17 However, till date, no regular base-catalyzed
studies have claimed the formation of the psicose monosugar, probably
might not have noticed or ignored. Psicose (or d-allulose)
is a C-3 epimer of fructose and recognized as an important zero-calorie
rare sugar compound particularly in the food and pharma sectors. It
possesses a non-caloric sweetener (70% relative sweeter than sucrose)
character and has an attractive property that it prevents the development
of diabetes.18,19 Till date, the biological conversion
method is widely used for producing psicose from fructose using prominent
enzymes like d-tagatose 3-epimerase (DTEase) and d-psicose 3-epimerase (DPEase),
achieving up to 28% higher conversion efficiency over chemical catalysis
involving ionic molecules (e.g., molybdate ions in acidic aqueous
solution).18,20,21

frequency is calculated as mole of converted glucose and fructose
formed per mole of nitrogen atom contained in spermine per unit second.
Carbon balance is derived based on the difference between moles of
carbon in products (fructose and mannose) and unreacted glucose and
to the mole of carbon in the initial glucose. Yx and Sx are the yield and selectivity
data of the respective compounds.

The hypothesis about the mechanism and production
of fructose as
a target product and mannose and psicose as byproducts in the isomerization
reaction catalyzed by spermine was further supported by the acquired 1H, 13C, and HSQC NMR characterization results.
It might be useful to recall that characteristic glucose can co-exist
in both forms as ring and open chain forms in aqueous medium. Based
on the analysis, it can be summarized that deprotonation of O-1 and
cleavage of C1–O5 ether linkage bond led to the formation of
an open ring structure of glucose, and hence, glucose isomerization
started from an open ring structure with organic polyamine as a catalyst.
While amines reacting with H2O molecules generated OH– anions which abstracted the proton from C-2 of glucose
resulting in the formation of a 1,2-enediol intermediate and the formation
of mannose took place through the rotation around the C2–C3
bond. For instance, 13C NMR revealed the characteristic
peak of mannose at δ = 97.7 ppm, thereby confirming the production
of mannose as a reaction byproduct (Figure 1c). Further, the little rearrangement in
the 1,2-enediol intermediate led to the synthesis of the target product
fructose because the formation of ketose predominated and isomerization
took place. Further, OH– anions abstracted proton
from C-3 of fructose leading to the formation of a 2,3-enediol intermediate
and ultimately, yielded psicose, which was once again confirmed through
the 13C NMR displaying the characteristic peak at δ
= 74.15 ppm (Figure 1c). In addition to the characteristic peaks of obtained sugars, the 1H NMR of the isomerized reaction mixture disclosed few minor
peaks in the region from δ = 2 to 2.5 ppm and was attributed
to the presence of residual spermine (Figure 2b). Thus, the fate of all the products obtained
during isomerization of glucose was dependent upon the formation of
the 1,2-enediol intermediate. Through NMR results, the formation of
this important intermediate was confirmed by comparing the 13C NMR of the isomerized mixture obtained from glucose and glucose-2-D
in water and water-2D (D2O), respectively. Because
deuterium was present at the C-2 position of glucose-2-D, its NMR
spectrum was found to be a bit different than the unlabeled glucose
(Figure 1). The three
peaks around δ = 3.15 ppm of glucose were missing in the spectrum
of glucose-2-D, as compared to unlabeled glucose (Figure 2a). Moreover, the NMR spectrum
of fructose obtained from labeled glucose-2-D in D2O did
not have multiple peaks around δ = 3.5 ppm because of the presence
of a deuterium atom at the C-1 position (Figure 2b).11 HSQC NMR
characterization analysis of the isomerized mixture confirmed the
fructose production, and the results are comparable to the standard
solution of sugars (Figure S4). Also, the
isomerized mixture of sugars obtained from unlabeled glucose in water
displayed all characteristics peak of glucose and fructose, indicating
that fructose obtained from glucose did not have deuterium at C-2
(Figure S4a). The decrease in the resonance
signal at δ = 63.8 and 62.6 ppm in the NMR spectra of fructose
obtained from glucose-2-D confirmed the presence of deuterium at the
C-1 position gained from D2O (Figure S4b). Thus, these results verified that the mechanism of isomerization
of glucose catalyzed by the spermine advanced via the 1,2-enediol
intermediate mechanism, including the removal of a proton at the C-2
position, followed by regaining a proton from solution. The formation
of the 1,2-enediol intermediate was also confirmed by UV spectroscopy.
Separation and purification of reaction media are often challenging,
especially when homogeneous catalysts are employed.9 However, homogeneous catalysts have advantages over heterogeneous
catalysts, such as the possibility of carrying out the reaction at
milder conditions, higher activity and selectivity, ease of spectroscopic
monitoring, and controlled and tunable reaction sites, but have limited
industrial applications due to the difficult and costly catalyst separation
and recovery. The unwanted colored byproducts in the isomerized mixture
were separated by simple purification with activated carbon.9 The reactant mixture turned colorless after the
purification as colored byproducts got adsorbed over the activated
carbon. The comparative UV spectra of the isomerized solution before
and after the purification are given in Figure S5. A sharp peak at 286 nm and a broad peak at 330 nm in the
UV spectrum of the colored solution indicated the presence of the
1,2-enediol intermediate and colored byproducts which disappeared
after the purification with activated carbon due to the drop in the
pH value from 9 to 6.22 A weak peak at
260 nm in the UV spectrum of the colorless solution might be due to
the neutral acyclic aldehyde form of glucose.23 To further confirm the presence of psicose as a byproduct in the
isomerization reaction, the traditional fermentation method was employed
to the resulting reaction mixture using Baker’s yeast. As a
result, all the fermentable sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and
mannose, got entirely degraded after 24 h fermentation except psicose
and those led to the formation of ethanol with a least amount of methanol,24 based on the high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis (Figure S6). The non-deconvoluted
chromatograms of the other sugar compounds and reaction mixture are
shown in Figure S7. It is established that
psicose is known as a rare sugar moiety of an antibiotic psicofuranine,
not found in nature in situ, and moreover, a non-fermentable sugar.25 Psicose was further isolated from the above
reaction mixture after fermentation by evaporating the produced solvent,
and the obtained psicose was freeze-dried. 13C NMR and 1H spectra of commercial psicose and isolated psicose are displayed
in Figure S8. Thus, the proposed reaction
scheme of spermine-catalyzed glucose isomerization to fructose and
further to the formation of psicose and mannose monosugars is illustrated
in Figure 3, based
on the analytical evidence.

to form fructose and
other byproducts in the presence of spermine in an aqueous condition.

The effect of temperature on fructose productivity
was studied
in the range between 40 and 120 °C while maintaining the other
parameters constant, that is, 6% catalyst dosage and reaction time
15 min (optimized from the kinetic studies as displayed in Figure 4). The temperature
had a significant impact on the glucose transformation; for instance,
at lower temperatures up to 80 °C, nominal fructose concentration
was attained, that is, 25% wt yield with 68% selectivity only after
prolonged isomerization (24 h) (Figure 4a–c). The highest fructose productivity was
achieved at 100 °C (30% yield with 74% selectivity), and a further
rise in temperatures showed an inverse effect, resulting in a ∼26%
relatively lower fructose yield (Figure 4d). The plots of glucose concentration versus
time at different temperatures while other parameters maintained constant
(6% mol catalyst dose) are displayed in Figure S9. Concerning reaction byproducts, nearly similar to the fructose
synthesis response trend was attained to mannose with the corresponding
rising temperatures. However, no or less formation of psicose was
noticed up to 80 °C, and the formation up to 4% wt was obeserved
at 100 °C, suggesting that 2,3-enolization is temperature-dependent.
The results obtained were compared and found to be consistent with
the literature.7,11,16 Hence, the 6% catalyst (spermine) loading to glucose at 100 °C
for 15 min was selected as an optimum condition for further evaluation
studies. Although a consistently increased glucose conversion was
achieved, the unwanted side reaction impeded the target product formation
under harsh conditions. Additionally, the turnover frequency (TOF),
calculated as a mole of converted glucose and produced fructose per
mole of nitrogen atom contained in spermine per unit time (Table 1) proposed that activation
of polyamine was highly dependent on temperature (R2 = 0.95 while correlating with the reaction temperature
as shown in Figure S10). The specific rate
constant data of the reactant well supported the above statement that
it increased as when the temperature increased (Table 1), but the maximum fructose yield was achieved
at 100 °C, suggesting that a higher thermal degradation of products
led to unwanted side product formation under raised temperatures.15 Overall, results displayed that spermine genuinely
promoted the degradation of a carbohydrate skeleton to achieve a wider
spectrum of products (predominantly fructose) through two different
enolization reactions in an aqueous medium. The relative differences
in the product (including byproducts such as mannose and psicose monosugars)
concentrations were probably attributed to the stability of the intermediate
molecules under a basic environment.26

temperatures, such as (a) 40, (b) 60, (c) 80, (d) 100, (e) 110, and
(f) 120 °C, while other parameters remained constant (6% mol
catalyst dose).

Evaluation of Polyamines
for Glucose-To-Fructose Transformation
Subsequently, several
other natural and synthetic polyamines, such
as cadaverine, diethylenetriamine, and spermidine, which are having
an identical linear alkyl chain conformation but differs in the number
of 10 and 20 amines (as displayed in Figure S1) have been evaluated for the comparative
studies in glucose isomerization in the aqueous phase. The estimated
pKa values of the corresponding polyamines
lie in the range between 10 and 11. The kinetic results obtained under
the optimum conditions (6% mol catalyst dose at 100 °C for 15
min) showed that all of the polyamines proceeded in the same pattern
for the formation of fructose (Figure 5), that is, a gradual increase in the fructose yield
and selectivity up to the optimum condition and beyond that a decreasing
trend of responses were recorded which could be attributed to the
participation of unwanted side reactions under higher severity conditions.
Among tested polyamines, cadaverine (has two 10 amines)
showed the least isomerization performance, that is, 22% wt fructose
yield and 47% selectivity (Figure 5a). However, others (diethylenetriamine and spermidine)
have an additional 20 amines in the centre of the linear
structure responded rather 23% wt yield and 25% selectivity over cadaverine.
Overall, in anticipation, the results obtained with other polyamines
were comparatively lower than spermine (has two 20 amines
located at equal distances in the linear chain with two 10 amines at both ends) which achieves an exceptionally higher result,
that is, up to 12–42% fructose yield and 23–54% selectivity
as compared to other tested polyamines (Figure 5d). The findings honestly suggested that
structural characteristics of polyamines, particularly the presence
of 20 amines affected the glucose transformation.8 Thus, the combinatorial effect of 10, 20 amines, and other critical factors, such as solvation
effects and steric hindrance tend to influence the glucose-to-fructose
isomerization positively. While referring the fructose selectivity,
a 39% relative increment was observed with the tested polyamines in
the order of spermidine > diethylenetriamine > cadaverine possibly
attributed to the increased basicity strength, though all had nearly
the same pKa values. Naturally, in addition
to the protonation ability of the nitrogen atom in the amine group,
it can form inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds through their
lone pair of electrons. Hydrogen bonding between amines and glucose
is said to be beneficial for the adsorption of glucose molecules,
but the inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding with water hampered
the glucose adsorption for the reaction.11 At the same time, the hydrogen bonding with water and fructose molecules
significantly influenced the accessibility of glucose to amine, thereby
obstructing the isomerization reaction. Therefore, the low catalytic
performance of the cadaverine was most likely due to the result of
the strong inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. However, other
polyamines showed an improved effect depending on the number of 20 amines present, which provided less chance to form inter-
and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding due to steric hindrance. Moreover,
the alkyl groups could enhance the basicity through raising the energy
of the lone pair of electrons. However, the steric hindrance offered
by the substituent groups could diminish the basicity of amine. In
a nutshell, all of the tested amines showed identical responses toward
the synthesis of mannose and psicose monosugars; however, the concentrations
were varied depending upon the selected polyamines. Except for cadaverine,
other polyamines exhibited nearly the same concentrations averagely
4.9 and 3.9%, respectively (mannose and psicose), corresponding to
the increased basicity in correlation with the 20 amines.
While discussing glucose conversion and carbon balance, it was observed
that only diethylenetriamine promoted higher glucose conversion (43%
beyond the average), but it also failed to control sugar degradation
through side reactions by offering higher basicity to the medium due
to the proximity placement of 10 and 20 amines
in the linear alkyl chain, suggesting that additional effects due
to the solvation of the amines or interactions between the amines
and the carbohydrates may play a role that remained to be elucidated.
Otherwise, all the amines showed a fair result with the corresponding
increased basicity.

isomerization at 100 °C for 60 min.

Augmentation of Fructose Productivity with a Modified Medium
The above results indicated that higher electron releasing capability
of the alkyl groups of spermine facilitated the glucose transformation
and therefore, an attempt was made to improve the target product yield
by modifying the reaction medium through external addition of neutral
salts.15 In theory, the polyamine could
form hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules by gaining a proton
from H2O (reversible reaction) and resulted in the release
of OH– anions, responsible for the glucose isomerization.
This routine performance made the polyamine with a positively charged
polyatomic ion (quaternary ammonium ion), which could specifically
bind with the anion of neutral salt (e.g., K+ Cl–) through the electrostatic attractive interactions. As a result,
the specific binding could shift the acid–base reaction equilibrium
between amine and water, which could favorably generate more OH– ions in the medium. The evaluation test was performed
by the addition of individual common neutral salts, such as KCl, NaCl,
NaBr, KI, and LiCl, in aqueous medium in the presence of spermine
under optimum conditions at pH0 8.5. The comparative result
displayed that KCl exhibited superior characteristics, attaining 33%
fructose yield and 73% selectivity along with 6% wt mannose and 5%
wt psicose (Figure 6). Perhaps KCl has the lowest covalent character among all the neutral
salts and highest ionic property. Only <2% variation of results
was achieved with the salts (probability, p is >0.05
and 1.28 standard deviation) and might be attributed to the slight
differences in the ionization potential between 7.5 (for KI) and 10.01
eV (for LiCl). Unfortunately, even with the synergistic effect of
addition of neutral salts and polyamine (spermine) in the reaction
medium, there was only 3% increase in yield and selectivity compared
to the reaction with absence of salts, indicating that the addition
of salts could have increased the favorable pH of the reaction (≥9.0)
which might have given rise to the unwanted side reactions.

addition of neutral salts to the isomerization reaction
medium conducted using spermine as a basic catalyst (6% mol dose)

Likewise, organic solvents also help in shifting the equilibrium
between glucose and fructose molecules toward the latter, that is,
in favor of fructose; as a result, improved productivity is achieved
well above the theoretical yield.27 Polar
aprotic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, have been commonly used in the conventional
studies owing to its higher monomeric sugars dissolution capacity,28−30 but those offer significant complications because of its high boiling
point (189–204 °C) property and other toxic side effects.31 In an alternative, recent studies have extensively
explored the use of lower alcohols in the carbohydrate conversion
processes and achieved impressive yield results. For instance, highest
fructose yield (56% wt) and product selectivity (80%) was achieved
over hydrotalcite heterogeneous catalyst in ethanol medium, wherein
the layered hydroxide structure exhibited the basic sites for effective
glucose isomerization. It was postulated that the addition of ethanol
into water shifted the isomerization equilibrium between glucose and
fructose toward the latter molecule.27 The
solvation effect could reasonably explain this shift in equilibrium
that fructose more readily underwent the solvation by ethanol as compared
to the glucose. Therefore, we tested the glucose isomerization reaction
using the diluted lower alcohols (ethanol/methanol) at 50:50 v/v ratio.32,33 Unfortunately, the reaction with ethanol resulted in 15% fructose
yield and 74% selectivity, was comparatively 2-times lower yield than
the aqueous phase reaction achieved after prolonged isomerization
(up to 4 h) (Figure S11). Whereas, diluted
methanol responded comparatively worse say 10% wt yield and 57% selectivity
than the other. The possible reason behind this poor rate of product
formation was the insufficient protonation of polyamine to release
the OH– ions necessary to maintain the basic ambient
for isomerization, based on the proton exchange mechanism. This statement
was verified with the results obtained when the reaction was conducted
using plain alcohol medium and 4–5% fructose yield with 57–64%
selectivity was observed (Figure S11).
Nevertheless, the systems (both diluted and plain forms) skipped the
epimerization reaction, allowing no or less formation of mannose (an
epimer of glucose) and psicose (an epimer of fructose) and that greatly
helped in achieving a higher selectivity (up to 74%) even at low productivity
(15% wt) (Figure S8). Thus, the above results
projected that OH– ions were contributing more for
the glucose transformation that could be achieved through complete
protonation of amines while reacting with water.

Selective Extraction
and Isomerization for Higher Fructose Production
Recent studies
have demonstrated the selective fructose extraction
strategy to isolate it from the post-isomerization mixture consisting
of equal or more amounts of glucose and other reaction byproducts
(typically mannose and psicose) for achieving an improved product
concentration further beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion,
for example, 75% yield and 70% selectivity. In a typical practice,
monoboronic acids and its derivatives have been popularly used for
this purpose as they exhibit inherent fructose selectivity among monosaccharides.
It has been defined that boronic acids showed high affinity to the
fructose molecule that contained a syn-periplanar pair of OH groups
available for its binding, that is, the β-d-fructofuranose
form whose relative percentage of total fructose was 25% in D2O medium at 31 °C and was comparatively higher than other
common monosaccharides, for example, α-d-glucofuranose
has 0.14% in D2O medium at 27 °C.34 In particular, NBA and PBA are prominent boronic acids
owing to their higher tendency of ester formation with carbohydrates.13,14 This technique has been widely employed in medical applications
for biosensing of monosaccharide sugars. To better understand the
monosaccharide complexation mechanism, assuming the mixture predominantly
consisted of aldose and ketose, the boronic acid derivatives existed
mostly in their conjugate-base form (BA–) at the
organic–aqueous interface developed through the addition of
an organic extraction solvent (1-octanol). The resulting conjugate
base could bind and form stable complexes preferably with ketoses
(K) than aldoses to form a boronate ester analogous to the carboxylate
ester (BAK–), which typically accumulates at the
interface. The introduction of a quaternary ammonium salt (Q+ Cl–), such as Aliquat 336, to the organic phase
enhanced the dissolution of the negatively charged conjugate-base
in the organic phase. The ion-pair formation between the ammonium
cation (Q+) and ester conjugate (BAK–) yielded a neutral complex (Q+) (BAK–) which was soluble in the organic phase, thereby allowing the movement
of sugar in priority to ketose from aqueous to the organic phase.
The whole phenomenon was conditionally effective when the reaction
medium was maintained at basic condition pH ≥ 8. The strength
of boronic acid binding to monosaccharides was determined by the orientation
and relative position of the hydroxyl groups in the system. It could
be noted that spermine favored the synthesis of other various monosaccharides
to an extent which was rather beyond our interest like the formation
of mannose and psicose during the glucose-to-fructose isomerization.
Therefore, initially, screening of monoboric acids, such as NBA and
PBA, which were selected from literature reports as carbohydrate complexing
agents, was performed to verify their suitability for spermine-assisted
isomerization for selective fructose extraction. In a typical practice,
it is critical to maintain the boronic acid concentration to the Aliquat
336 ratio under ideal conditions. The test was performed using the
1-octanol organic medium consisting of known concentration of PBA
and Aliquat 336 (at equal ratio) to the aqueous phase isomerization
catalyzed by spermine and a biphasic system was generated. However,
a strong interaction between PBA and monosugars was noticed, resulting
in 43% glucose extraction, which was not expected. Therefore, the
combination was optimized to 4:1 (PBA/Aliquat 336) as it depicts the
highest fructose selectivity (70%) and lowest glucose extraction (31%)
(Table S3). The recovery of fructose and
other sugars was estimated through the typical back extraction protocol
where the organic medium was treated with dilute H2SO4 to lower the pH. The organic extraction process could be
repeated to the same aqueous medium for the complete recovery of fructose.
The protocol took six consecutive extractions within a single extraction
procedure to achieve the maximum result, that is, 44% fructose recovery
and 63% selectivity (Table S3). NBA exhibited
better results under the same operating conditions, that is, up to
70% fructose recovery and 70% of selectivity but within four consecutive
extractions (Table 2), suggesting the structural characteristics of aryl monoboronic
acid could greatly influence the binding affinity to carbohydrates
(Figure 7). Subsequently,
the aqueous mediums which were rich in residual glucose concentration
from all of the extraction steps were collectively isomerized with
the additional supplementation of spermine to maintain the desired
pH and to compensate the loss of OH– anions due
to the transfer to the organic phase (based on the initial and final
pH values of the medium). The considerably improved fructose yield
results with the sequential extraction and isomerization procedures,
that is, relatively 70% encouraged to repeat the cycle to achieve
the highest 75% fructose yield and 70% selectivity up to 3 and beyond
that, no significant improvement was achieved (≤1% wt fructose
yield). It was concluded that each of the extraction procedure required
at least 4 repeat extractions and all of them attained nearly the
same proportion of fructose recovery say averagely 22, 16, 12, and
9% (Table 2 and Figure 8). In addition, all
of the extraction protocols carried traces of other monosugars, including
glucose, mannose, and psicose up to 5% wt and it was significant beyond
4 extractions, particularly to glucose. This attitude of NBA is due
to its binding affinity to OH groups of other monosaccharides to a
certain extent. The binding affinity of aryl boronic acids to sugars
is generally arranged in the order of fructose > galactose >
mannose
> glucose.34 The formation of the diol–borate
complex due to the covalent binding between sugars and NBA was also
confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescent boronic acids
have been extensively used as fluorescent probes for the detection
of biologically important monosaccharides. Figure S12 displays the fluorescence spectrum of NBA dispersed in
1-octanol and Aliquat 336 at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and
a sharp emission peak at λ = 408 nm was observed,35 whereas the spectrum of the assay containing
isomerized mixture of sugars bonded covalently with NBA in organic
phase exhibited significant decrease in fluorescence intensity along
with red shift due to the photoinduced electron transfer mechanism,
indicating the formation of the diol–borate complex which is
non-fluorescent in nature.36 The different
binding characteristics of these sugars can be attributed to the different
dihedral angles of diols of these sugars.37 Based upon the order of affinity of boronic acids toward sugars,
their corresponding selective binding positions and mechanisms have
been proposed. It has been reported that the relative affinity of
boronates for diols in most carbohydrates is of the order: cis-1,2-diol > 1,3-diol ≫ trans-1,2-diol.38 Thus, certain monosaccharides
have an intrinsically
higher affinity for boron acids. Taking all the important considerations
into account, we attempted to identify the binding position between
sugars and boronic acids, for example, NBA tended to bind at C-1 and
C-2 positions of α-d-glucopyranose, and α-d-glucopyranose cis-C-1,2 diol borate complex
is formed. Similarly, α-d-mannopyranose cis-C-2,3 diol borate, β-d-fructofuranose cis-C-2,3 diol borate, and α-d-furanopsicose cis-C-3,4 diol borate complexes were expected to form from
corresponding sugars depending upon how easily these positions are
available to boronic acids. Based on the binding affinity and stability
of these complexes, around 80% d-psicose was extracted from
the reaction mixture, which is relatively 33% higher than fructose
extraction, whereas around 46% d-mannose and 14% d-glucose were extracted from the mixture, and these values are comparatively
40 and 90% lower than fructose extraction (Table 2). Therefore, the above order can be comfortably
rearranged as psicose > fructose > galactose > mannose >
glucose.25Figure 8 vividly portrays the distribution of sugars
during each of
the isomerization and subsequent extraction procedures. Moreover,
the psicose–borate complex when interacted with enzyme systems
(like DPEase) shifted the equilibrium between fructose and psicose,
thereby enabling the greater formation of psicose from fructose.19,25 Further, the borate of the psicose–borate complex could be
easily removed using the Amberlite IRA-743 and Dowex 50 resins.39 This approach creates a new avenue to produce
a relatively attractive sugar molecule through the single-step conversion
from bio-derived glucose. Moreover, the use of spermine also ruled
out the requirement of buffers to maintain the pH during the extraction
protocols (i.e., ≥8.0) and thus managed to serve as a catalyst
and buffer reagent during the glucose isomerization and selective
fructose extraction. Overall, the attractive yield result (30% yield
and 74% selectivity) obtained in each isomerization stage by the influence
of spermine succeeded over the literature reports involving either
inorganic phosphate buffer reagents (NaH2PO4 + Na2HPO4) or expensive enzymes (glucose isomerase),
which achieved the fructose yield of 15–45% wt and >52%
selectivity.13,14

Conclusions
In summary, the current study demonstrates the endogenous polyamine
spermine as a potential basic catalyst for glucose-to-fructose isomerization
in the aqueous phase. Appreciably, a maximum of 30% fructose yield
and 74% selectivity result was attained during the single step isomerization
under the modest reaction conditions with the aid of predominant 20 amines of spermine. Further, the polyamine cooperated effectively
during the subsequent extraction and isomerization procedures, achieving
a reasonable fructose recovery with the help of aryl monoboronic acid,
NBA. However, traces of other important reaction byproducts, such
as mannose and psicose were also present. It unfastens a new avenue
that an appropriate protocol can be applied for further selective
extraction of psicose, a rare sugar molecule, to treat with enzyme
systems when it is in the psicose–borate complex form to achieve
higher product concentration from fructose. Overall, this study shows
that the natural endogenous polyamine promoted the synthesis of fructose
from glucose through the sequential isomerization and extraction procedures,
achieving the highest productivity of 75% wt fructose yield and 70%
selectivity within shorter cycles as compared to the literature. This
strategy of fructose production could help in improving the furan
product concentration during the subsequent dehydration reaction.

Chemicals

listed in Table S1. All the chemicals were
of analytical grade and used as received without any modification.
Dried Baker’s yeast (crown) was purchased over the counter
from the local market in Mohali, India for the fermentation experiment.

Glucose Isomerization
The glucose isomerization reaction
was carried out in a 5 mL thick-walled glass reactor. In a typical
reaction, glucose [1 mL of 10% (w/v) stock solution prepared using
deionized (DI) water] and the catalyst (homogeneous polyamine) were
loaded into the glass reactor (maximum 18% mol on glucose) and sealed
tightly. The reactor was pre-warmed depending on the reaction temperature
and heated up to 120 °C using an oil bath on a hot plate under
continuous stirring at 200 rpm. The reaction was allowed to proceed
for variable times (1–1440 min) and then stopped immediately
by cooling the reactor in an ice bath. Small aliquots of the sample
were collected intermittently, diluted using DI water, and stored
in the refrigerator at 4 °C until used for sugars and other organic
acid analyses. The experiments were performed in duplicate, and error
bars were plotted. For conducting the isomerization reaction in a
modified medium, the above procedure was repeated with external addition
of neutral salts (KCl/NaCl/NaBr/KI/LiCl) at 10% wt or just replacement
of water medium into diluted alcohol solution (ethanol/methanol) at
a 50:50 ratio (aqueous to alcohol).

Selective Fructose Extraction
After the isomerization
reaction, selective extraction of fructose from the post-reaction
liquid medium (aqueous) was performed by external addition of an organic
phase which is comprised of PBA/NBA (for complexation of ketose molecule)
and Aliquat 336 (for dissolution of boronic acid in the organic medium)
dissolved in 1-octanol. Briefly, equal volumes of organic phase and
aqueous phase (at least 2 mL from the isomerization experiment) were
continuously stirred for an hour at room temperature. Afterward, both
phases were separated by centrifugation for 15 min at 8000 rpm. Once
the biphasic layer regenerated, the organic phase was separated that
consisted of 1-octanol and the aryl borate–fructose complex.
After splitting the phases, back extraction was performed by treating
the organic phase with 0.4 M H2SO4. Meanwhile,
the collected aqueous phase was once again treated with fresh organic
phase with added spermine (3% mol) to maintain the pH at 8.5 required
for isomerization. This organic extraction procedure was consecutively
repeated for at least four times to achieve complete recovery of synthesized
fructose. After all repeated extraction procedures, the left behind
aqueous solution was isomerized with additionally supplemented glucose
(depending on the residual concentration) to normalize the reactant
concentration and spermine (6% mol) under the same conditions maintained
for the first run. Before each isomerization step, a small aliquot
was collected, diluted using DI water, and stored in the refrigerator
at 4 °C until used for sugars analysis. The whole extraction
procedure was carried out in the absence of salts because salts could
obstruct the movement of the sugar complex to organic phase in the
isomerized mixture.

The results reported from the extraction
steps are calculated as      

Characterization
and Analysis Method
All the pH measurements
were made using a digital Mettler Toledo pH meter (FiveEasyPlus FP20).
Colour measurements of the reaction mixture were done on the Shimadzu
UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2600). The fluorescence spectrum
of the samples was recorded on a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer
(Agilent Technologies). 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The residual
and product concentrations of glucose, fructose, mannose, and psicose
molecules were measured on HPLC (Agilent Technologies 1200 infinity
series). The system was equipped with an Agilent Hi-Plex Ca column
(300 mm length and 8 mm porosity) and maintained at 85 °C with
0.6 ml/min flow rate using HPLC grade water as a mobile eluent. The
concentration of sugars was calculated using the respective calibration
charts prepared using commercial grade chemicals. The calibration
standards for glucose, fructose, mannose, and psicose were prepared
in DI water. Glucose and other product yield and recovery were estimated
based on the difference in residual to initial concentration of the
respective monosugars. Similarly, the products selectivity was calculated
based on the difference in concentration of products to glucose reacted.

Fermentation of Isomerization Medium
All the necessary
plasticwares used were sterilized under an autoclave condition (121
°C, 15 psi) for 15 min. In a typical fermentation, 6 mL of the
reaction mixture (raw isomerized aqueous medium) was taken in a 100
mL autoclavable glass tube along with 8% wt monopotassium phosphate
(KH2PO4) and 3.5% wt of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4·7H2O) as a fermentation supplement. Yeast
culture was prepared separately by dissolving 1 gm dried yeast powder
in 10 mL of water. The as-prepared yeast culture was introduced to
the glass tube containing sugars substrate. The pH of the fermentation
broth was adjusted to 7.0 (using diluted NaOH solution). The tube
was placed in the shaker incubator maintained at 30 °C and 250
rpm for 24 h. In the end, a small aliquot was collected from each
fermentation broth and analyzed on HPLC for the determination of the
fermentation product (e.g., ethanol) and residual sugar concentration.
