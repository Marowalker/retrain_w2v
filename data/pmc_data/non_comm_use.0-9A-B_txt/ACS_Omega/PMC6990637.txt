In a recent study, a new procedure for Z-selective
olefin synthesis by reductive coupling of alkyl iodides with terminal
alkynes in the presence of iron salts is described. This transformation
is representative of many newly developed synthetic routes through
the involvement of multiple species and phases, which makes mechanistic
insight hard to obtain. Here, we report computational work aimed at
exploring the possible reaction pathways. DFT calculations lead to
two suggested routes, one involving C–I reduction by metallic
zinc and radical addition to the alkyne and the other involving addition
of two reduced iron species to the alkyne bond followed by reductive
elimination. Comparison to experimental results as well as kinetic
modeling is used to discuss the likelihood of these and related mechanisms.

Introduction
In recent years, many new synthetic procedures
have been developed
for carrying out reactions such as cross-coupling using non-noble
metal containing species as catalysts. Non-noble-metal catalysts can
in principle have many environmental and cost advantages, but from
the mechanistic point of view, many of the newly developed reactions
are much less straightforward to understand than more conventional
catalyst systems based on second- and third-row transition metals.1 This problem is compounded in the popular class
of reactions involving a solid metal as the coreagent and reducing
agent.2,3

Within the burgeoning field of non-noble-metal
catalysis, iron
compounds play an important part, with the extensive work on the topic
having already led to a number of reviews.4−8 The synthetic scope of the developed transformations
is already impressive, though obtaining a full mechanistic understanding
remains highly challenging. Many mechanistic suggestions have been
made based on extrapolation from the single-metal-center mechanisms
that are common in palladium-catalyzed reactions, but these suggestions
fail in many cases to account for all experimental observations.9,10

Computational chemistry has become one of the most commonly
used
tools to examine reaction mechanisms1,11 and has been
used, in particular, in many studies of iron catalysis to provide
additional insight12 and here, too.
In some cases, computation has been used to predict structures and
energies for key intermediates and transition states in possible reaction
steps.13 There have also been studies of
putative complete catalytic reaction cycles.14−16 In other cases,
though, given the immense complexity of predicting mechanisms against
a background of incomplete experimental mechanistic input, computation
has been assigned only the ancillary role of characterizing the structure
and spectroscopic properties of intermediates.17 These difficulties in non-noble-metal catalysis are only
magnified when considering complex multiphase processes involving
solid metal coreagents.

One of the most widely studied and developed
iron-catalyzed reactions
is the Kumada18 type that involves a Grignard
reagent as a transmetalating nucleophile reacting with an organic
halide molecule.19 Cross-coupling reactions
of the Negishi20 and Sonogashira21−23 types have also been studied. Extensive work is being carried out
nowadays to develop new ligands for iron-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions.24−26 In this computational investigation, we study an
unusual type of cross-coupling reaction involving an iron catalyst
with no added ligand, and alkyne and alkyl iodide substrates, which
are reductively coupled in the presence of metallic zinc to produce Z-alkenes with high selectivity.27 This reaction is challenging to study computationally for a number
of reasons, such as the absence of added ligands for the metal center,
implying instead of solvent ligation, the use of Zn(0) as the reducing
agent, and the lack of direct identification of intermediates. The
cross-coupling reaction we modeled has phenylacetylene and cyclohexyl
iodide as reactants, dissolved in the N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) solvent, and in the presence of a reducing
agent. The experimental study was previously reported.27

Results
The starting point for this investigation was
a suggested mechanism
put forward in the original communication of the synthetic results.27 This mechanism involved, in brief, (i) reduction
of the starting Fe(II) catalyst to an Fe(I) species by metallic Zn,
(ii) electron transfer from Fe(I) to the alkyl iodide followed by
dissociation into iodide and alkyl radical, (iii) alkyl radical addition
to the β-position of the (terminal) alkyne to form a vinyl radical,
(iv) recombination of the vinyl radical with a second equivalent of
Fe(I) species to form an Fe(II)-vinyl product, with steric factors
favoring Fe addition E to the alkyl group, and (v)
transmetalation from Fe to Zn to form a vinyl-zinc species, the hydrolysis
of which during workup would lead to the product. This mechanism was
suggested based on observed reactivity and selectivity, including
careful testing of the scope of the reaction, varying the metal catalyst,
alkyne and halide substrates, the solvent, and so on. These results
provide valuable information concerning possible mechanistic variants,
but no detailed mechanistic study was performed. We set out to investigate
the proposed steps and possible variants using computation, but before
doing so, some methodological choices needed to be made.

First
of all, the starting iron bromide catalyst as well as all
the related iron complexes must presumably react after dissolving
in the polar solvent used, DMA. Related amide solvents NMP and DMF
were also observed experimentally to lead to reasonable reactivity,
while a reaction in THF was found to be much less favorable.28 Clearly, the metal must form complexes with
the solvent, whose structure is presumably important for determining
reactivity. Accordingly, we started by exploring the structure and
relative Gibbs energy of the key metal species FeBr2, FeBr,
and ZnBr2 in complex with variable numbers of explicit
DMA solvent molecules together with an implicit, continuum, to model
the effect of the bulk solvent. For Fe(I)Br, a trigonal disolvated
complex is predicted to be most stable, well below the tri- and monosolvated
forms in free energy. For Fe(II)Br2, a tetrahedral disolvated
state is most stable. Finally, the zinc(II) complex is also predicted
to favor a disolvated tetrahedral structure. In this case, there is
experimental29 and computational30 evidence supporting the disolvated structure
(Figure 1).

For
the iron species, it is also important to carefully consider
different possible spin states. The assignment of the spin state for
iron complexes is not trivial, as shown in many works from the literature,31−37 with computational results known to be quite sensitive to the DFT
functional. The B3LYP38 hybrid functional
used here appears to be reasonably accurate for iron complexes, and
this is supported by our benchmarking results (see the Supporting Information) for compounds similar
to those studied here. Detailed results on calculated relative energies
for different spin states are in the Supporting Information. In brief, our calculations show that the iron
complexes prefer high-spin states, with solvated FeBr2 adopting
a quintet state and FeBr a quartet state. For other monoiron complexes
described below, we find the same preference, with Fe(I), Fe(II),
and Fe(III) species adopting quartet, quintet, and quartet ground
states, respectively. For bimetallic species, the individual metal
centers are also high-spin, and indeed, these centers also prefer
to couple in a high-spin manner (the antiferromagnetic couple returns
slightly higher energies) (Figure 1).

and singlet ground state, respectively; Fe(I) complex on the right

Treatment of Metallic Zn(0)
The reaction considered
here involves metallic zinc as one of the key reagents, which requires
that relative free energies of solid zinc, dissolved zinc-containing
species, and transition states for Zn-oxidation steps be obtained.
This is not trivial within the framework of molecular quantum chemical
methods. While solid zinc (and species at its surface) can of course
be treated using periodic density functional theory methods, this
makes it challenging to obtain relative energies compared to solution-phase
species, assuming that these are treated using standard molecular
quantum chemical techniques. Instead, we have used a combined technique
based on quantum chemical calculations on isolated species only, together
with experimental data for solid and gaseous zinc to compute thermodynamics
for steps involving solid zinc. In this procedure, we calculated the
free energy of a single zinc atom in the gas phase at the same level
of theory as for the other species, from which we subtracted the experimental39 sublimation free energy for a mole of solid
zinc (22.7 kcal/mol), paying attention to consistent use of standard
states in both the computational and experimental values. In this
way, we obtain an estimate of the Gibbs energy of formation of solid
zinc that can be combined with regular computed Gibbs energies for
other zinc-containing species such as ZnBr2. For the kinetics
of reactions with solid zinc, we use an approach again based on the
experiment, as outlined below.

Reduction Steps
The active species of the reaction
appears unclear due to the significant challenge of detecting experimentally
the oxidation state of the iron salts during the reaction process.
This is a common problem in cross-coupling catalysis by iron compounds,
with suggested oxidation states covering the range from Fe(−II)
to Fe(III) having been suggested.40−44 In recent publications, the Fe(I) species has been
proposed as the active species for the ligand-free reaction45 and indeed was also suggested for the present
reaction.27 However, our calculations suggest
that reduction of FeBr2 to FeBr by metallic zinc in DMA
is prohibitively endergonic, with a Gibbs energy difference of 27
kcal/mol. Taking into account that there will additionally be a kinetic
barrier to reduction, this strongly suggests that formation of discrete
FeBr (with only DMA as the additional ligand) in the target reaction
can be ruled out.

Neither bromide or DMA is able to display
ligand non-innocence, so they cannot stabilize the unfavorable Fe(I)
oxidation state by imparting partial Fe(0) or Fe(II) character, as
commonly occurred for other reported Fe(I) species.46,47 In the presence of ligands, however, the stability of Fe(I) can
be enhanced, and this changes the calculated free energy of reduction.
In the present case, initial coordination of alkyne 6 to 1 to form complex 9 affords a more
easily reducible species. The binding step is calculated to be moderately
uphill in Gibbs energy, by 6.4 kcal/mol, such that the alkyne complex
will be present in small amounts. Reduction of 9 by solid
zinc to form Fe(I)-phenylacetylene complex 10 is only
slightly endergonic, by 1.3 kcal/mol. This reflects the ability of
the alkyne π* to accept d-electrons by back-bonding.
Indeed, in a previous study, Fe(I) has been shown to bind strongly
to alkynes.48 Here, the back-bonding is
also evident from some topological characteristics of our calculated
complexes. One notable feature is the significant bending of both
the Ph–C–C and H–C–C angles in 10, with values of 156.50° and 147.86°, respectively, compared
to the Fe(II) species 9 where the angles are more linear,
with values of 177.20° and 163.68°, respectively. The C≡C
bond distance also shows the effect, increasing from 1.21 Å in
the free alkyne 6 to 1.23 Å in 9 and
1.27 Å in 10. Finally, the Fe–C bonds also
show evidence for the enhanced interaction in 9, decreasing
in length from 2.40 (Fe–C(H)) and 2.22 Å (Fe–C(Ph))
in 9 to 1.96 and 2.00 Å, respectively, in 10.

Another route for the initial reduction involves
direct cleavage
of the C–I bond in cyclohexyliodide 5 to generate
the cyclohexyl (Cy) radical 8. This step is predicted
by the method we use to be favorable in Gibbs energy terms, by 3.4
kcal/mol. As for all steps involving the reaction with solid zinc,
estimating the barrier height is not trivially feasible within a molecular
quantum chemical protocol, and a discussion of the approach that we
have used to estimate reactivity for such steps is deferred until
a later section. The radical can add almost without a barrier to 1 to form Fe(III) adduct 11 in an exergonic way
(−3.6 kcal/mol). Complex 11 can be further reduced
by zinc, in an exergonic process, to form Fe(II) complex 12. This species can also be formed by displacement of alkyne from 10.

In most of the experiments,27 an iodinated
substrate was used together with an iron-bromide catalyst. Good results
were also obtained with iron iodide as the catalyst. Due to the presence
of two different halides, many of the intermediates and TSs to be
discussed below could in principle exist as different isomers with
varying numbers of Br and I groups. For simplicity, we have chosen
to model the C–X bond breaking steps (Figure 2) with X = I; all other halides have been
modeled as Br. Atom abstraction requires the use of iodide given the
weaker C–I bond. However, for other steps, the halide plays
a less important role, so this simplification seems reasonable. However,
to test its impact, we modeled some iron reduction steps with iodide
instead of bromide leading to formation of ZnI2 (see the Supporting Information). These steps were found
to be slightly more favorable in free energy terms than the corresponding
bromine transfer steps. For the C–C bond formation and transmetalation
steps discussed below, we expect that the use of Br in place of I
does not have a major effect on calculated energies, and overall,
the approach used here should be acceptable.

and without coordination of phenylacetylene
or the cyclohexyl radical, and atom abstraction reaction by solid
Zn(0) calculated using experimental data. The possibility of a bromide
or iodide group has been shown to compare the small change in free
energy. All the free energy values are calculated at the B3LYP-D3BJ-DKH/BS2 level of theory and shown in kcal/mol  relative to
the isolated reactants at the beginning of the reaction. The correct
amount of solvent molecules is included. L = DMA solvent molecule.

We note that adding TMEDA to the reaction medium
does not affect
reactivity,27 even though it has been shown
to inhibit formation of iron clusters in Kumada-type reactions.49−54 This suggests that iron nanoparticles are not responsible for catalysis,
and we have not attempted to model them here.

C–C Bond Formation Steps
The above reduction
steps lead to a variety of reduced species that are in principle able
to undergo cross-coupling steps with formation of a C–C bond.
We have modeled several of these possible steps (Figure 3). The first option is addition
of the bare cyclohexyl radical to the alkyne, as suggested in the
original experimental study.27 The corresponding TS2 is quite low in potential energy terms, but there is a
significant barrier in free energy terms (10.4 kcal/mol). The resulting
metal-free vinyl radical can add either to the zinc surface or to
an Fe(II) or Fe(I) species to form a metal-vinyl species. Another
possibility is that the radical can add to the coordinated alkyne,
in complex either with an Fe(I) (10) or an Fe(II) (9) center, leading over TS3, TS3b, or TS4 to the iron-vinyl species P1z (Z) or P1e (E) (Figure 4 and Supporting Information). TS3 has an overall triplet ground
state formed by a quartet iron center and a doublet radical with antiferromagnetic
coupling of the spins. This TS has a negative (spin-down) spin density
of −0.89 on the radical carbon atom. TS3b has
an overall quartet spin state with electron density similar to TS3 but with the iron center as the quintet state. The structure
of TS4 can be best described in terms of the FeBrCy(alkyne)
complex 14 that is formed upon addition of the cyclohexyl
radical to 10. This species can undergo migratory insertion
of the alkyne into the Fe–C bond. Accordingly, TS4 has a quintet ground state with the four unpaired electrons located
on the iron center.

are calculated at the B3LYP-D3BJ-DKS/BS2 level of theory.
The values are shown in kcal/mol and relative to the isolated reactants

A more complicated mechanism involves addition
of the Fe(II) 12 to the alkyne complex 10 through TS5, yielding the diiron complex 13, which can then undergo
reductive elimination through TS6 with formation of the
C–C bond. Both TS5 and TS6 are calculated
to have octet ground states, corresponding to a total of seven unpaired
electrons, corresponding to three unpaired electrons in the iron of 10 and four in 12. This last mechanism necessarily
leads to a Z-vinyl species due to the anti-arrangement of the two iron centers in TS5, and so,
this step could in principle account for the Z-selectivity
of the reaction. The other TSs (TS2 to TS4) can yield either E- or Z-vinyl-metal
species.

Transmetalation
Formation of vinyl-iron species is
not the end of the reaction since only catalytic amounts of iron are
used. A transmetalation process involving a Zn(II) complex interacting
with the adducts P1e and P1z leads to formation
of the vinyl-zinc species P2z (Z) and P2e (E) and releases 1 (Figure 4). We have explored
the mechanism followed in this process in some detail and suggest
that the reaction proceeds by initial interaction of zinc dibromide 4 with the products P1e/z creating a bromide
bridged complex 15e/z connecting the two metal centers;
this step is accompanied by loss of a coordinating solvent molecule.
Afterward, the zinc atom can interact with the vinylic carbon atom
by crossing a transition state TS7e/z with activation
barriers of 8 and 6 kcal/mol, respectively, for the E and Z diastereoisomers, leading to a diamond-like
structure 16 where both the iron and zinc atoms are coordinating
the central vinylic carbon atom as well as a bridging bromide. The
product is subsequently formed by breaking the interaction between
the Fe(II) center and the vinylic carbon. This step also involves
coordination of an incoming solvent molecule to iron. Despite multiple
attempts, no saddle point could be found for this step, either with
or without inclusion of the additional solvent molecule. It appears
that, in each case, there is no potential energy barrier (see the Supporting Information for relevant scans). Releasing
iron dibromide 1 from 17 then yields the
final vinyl-zinc species P2—this step is exergonic
due to coordination of a solvent molecule.

As mentioned above,
some mechanisms naturally lead to E- or Z-vinyl-iron species, and it is interesting to examine whether the
transmetalation process can be accompanied by Z-
to E-isomerization. For each step along the transmetalation
route, isomerization transition-state structures were located, but
they were all found to lie quite high in free energy, so they appear
not to play an important role. The lowest energy isomerization TS, TS_iso, lies at relative free energies of −20.7 and
22 kcal/mol above P1z, thereby higher by almost 5 kcal/mol
than TS7e, suggesting that isomerization should not compete
with transmetalation.

Summing up
The above landscape of possible reactive
steps provides some first insights into the mechanism of the cross-coupling,
but firm mechanistic conclusions require an assessment of the relative
probability of each route. Some indication is given by the relative
free energies. As already mentioned, the high standard free energy
predicted for the unligated Fe(I) bromide suggests that a route involving
initial reduction of the metal salt is not possible. Next, similar
free energies for TS2 and TS4 to TS6 suggest that each of the corresponding steps could be competitive
under catalytic conditions. However, given the complex interplay between
reduction steps involving metallic zinc and these steps, it is difficult
to predict which of them should dominate. It should also be noted
that the cyclohexyl radical (and perhaps the vinyl radical formed
from addition through TS2) can undergo radical homocoupling
and/or dismutation. These steps would most likely involve no potential
energy barrier and so should in principle be rather fast, though they
require a reaction between two a priori low-concentration
highly reactive species, whereas the other steps mentioned above do
not.

Overall, while the structures and energies calculated for
the various species provide valuable insight into the reaction mechanism,
they do not on their own provide quantitative insight into how exactly
cross-coupling occurs. For this purpose, we turn to kinetic modeling
of the reactions.

Kinetics
In order to deduce the behavior of the reactants
and understand which are the main reaction steps that lead to the
most abundant product (P2z), a kinetic analysis seems
mandatory.55 To do so, we need access to
the rate constants for all modeled steps, which together with initial
concentrations allow us to integrate the rate equations to provide
a time course of the reaction. There are three types of steps that
need to be modeled. First, where we could locate a saddle point on
the potential energy surface, we can use the Eyring equation of transition-state
theory, combined with the corresponding relative free energies, to
obtain forward and reverse rate constants. Next, some steps are found
to be barrierless in either the forward or the reverse direction.
In line with our previous work,56 we assume
that these steps are diffusion-controlled in the direction where they
are exergonic. A simple theory for such reactions57 approximates their rate constants to be kd = 8RT/3η, where η is the
viscosity of the solvent. Here, using η = 0.92 cP for the viscosity
of DMA,58 we obtain kd = 7.23 × 109 dm3 mol–1 s–1, which corresponds to a free energy barrier
of about 4 kcal/mol in terms of the Eyring equation. The rate constant
for the reverse of such diffusion-controlled reactions can then be
obtained from the detailed balance.

Finally, we need to model
reactions with the zinc surface. Here, we rely on a combination of
experimental data and a form of Marcus theory to obtain a rough estimate
of the corresponding rate constants. The experimental data59 concerned the kinetics of bromide or chloride
abstraction from alkyl halides by solid zinc in the DMF solvent, which
has been shown60 to have as the first and
presumably rate-limiting step a halogen atom transfer to the surface
with formation of a radical, which then undergoes slower conversion
to an alkyl-zinc species. We assume that the measured rate constants59 can provide an estimate of the rate constants
for related steps corresponding to halogen atom transfer to solid
zinc. Our analysis, described in detail in the Supporting Information, also makes certain assumptions about
the surface area of the zinc metal used in the reaction. Analysis
of the experimental data suggests that the free energy barriers ΔG‡ for halogen atom transfer steps to
solid zinc could be approximately described in terms of the Marcus
theory equation: . The required inputs here are the calculated
free energy of reaction ΔG0 and
an intrinsic barrier height λ, which we determine
from analysis of reference experimental rates59 to be 86.7 kcal/mol.

After this set up, we run a kinetic analysis
using the software
Tenua61 and initial conditions corresponding
to [1] = 0.1 M, [2] = 2 M, [5] = 1.2 M, and [6] = 1.0 M. A summary of all the key
steps modeled is shown in the catalytic cycle of Figure 5.

main reaction path calculating after kinetic
analysis by using the free energy values described on the thermodynamic
section at the B3LYP-D3BJ-DKH/BS2 level of theory. L
= DMA solvent molecule.

The kinetic model obtained in a manner just described
gives as
an outcome that the reaction is predicted to occur somewhat too quickly
(a timescale of a few minutes, compared to experiments,27 which occur on a timescale of hours). A mismatch
in timescales is not too surprising given that our Marcus analysis
for reactions at the Zn surface is approximate and may lead to an
overestimate of the reactivity. Adjusting the intrinsic barrier λ
tunes the speed of the overall conversion without affecting in a major
way the selectivity between the different pathways.

Next, in
terms of the mechanism followed, this kinetic model predicts
that C–C bond formation proceeds entirely through TS2, that is, by addition of the cyclohexyl radical to the free alkyne,
to form a vinyl radical P0 in essentially quantitative
yield (99%) with respect to the initial amount of alkyne in the reaction.
This radical is assumed to then couple to the zinc surface ultimately
forming a vinyl-zinc species that yields product upon aqueous workup.
This is the step that was suggested in the experimental study. The
preferential C–Zn bond forming at the less hindered side of
the vinyl radical could account for the 14:1 Z:E alkene selectivity observed. The kinetic model also predicts
the formation of some (at full conversion of alkyne, roughly 4% with
respect to the amount of cyclohexyl iodide) radical–radical
homocoupling product. This reaction (forming dicyclohexyl) is expected
to be accompanied by some radical disproportionation (yielding cyclohexene
plus cyclohexane), with an experiment reporting a branching ratio
of roughly 1:1 for these channels,62 but
we have treated this as a single step. In the experiments, traces
of the homocoupling and disproportionation products are observed,
but the amounts appear to be less than what is modeled here. The increased
yields of these products here could again be due to the approximate
methods used to compute the rate constant for radical production—slower
formation of the radical will lead to lower standard-state concentrations
and less self-reaction.

On the other hand, the model yields
only tiny amounts of products
via the iron-containing routes. The formation rate of the species
such as 9 and 10 turns out to be uncompetitive
with the formation and reaction of the radical with the phenyl acetylene.
The concentration of these iron-containing intermediates is modeled
to be of the order of only 10–6 M. In the model,
they do then react to form product P1e through TS4, but the associated yield is very low, roughly 0.0001%.
The yield of products through the bimetallic mechanism involving species 10 and 12 and TS5 and TS6 is also roughly 0.0001%, reflecting similar free energies of TSs TS4, TS5, and TS6. This is because
the rate of the bimetallic mechanism depends on the concentrations
of two iron-containing species (e.g., 10 and 12), whereas the rate of the monometallic mechanism only depends on
one species.

Our kinetic model is dependent on multiple calculated
rate constants
that could be inaccurate. Therefore, we also explored modified kinetic
models to assess how large the errors in individual calculated rate
constants would need to be in order for the bimetallic mechanism to
become dominant in product formation. The minimally modified free
energy surface needed for this is shown in Figure S7. We found that the most natural way to drive the model toward
the bimetallic mechanism was to change the free energy of formation
of alkyne complex 9 (by 6 kcal/mol). All the iron-contained
species formed from 9 are also shifted by this amount,
and the TS for reduction of 9 to 10 is lowered
by an additional 1 kcal/mol. This modified model shows a dominance
for the bimetallic mechanism with the yield of the related product P2z of 82%, with roughly 5% of E-conformer P2e, which originates from the migratory insertion reaction
through TS4. Roughly 13% of the vinyl radical is still
formed through TS2. The outcome of this revised model
agrees better with observed Fe-dependent reaction outcomes (see below).
The large change in the calculated relative free energy seems to be
slightly beyond the uncertainties associated with the quantum chemical
procedure, but we do note that changes in relative energies of 3–4
kcal/mol do occur when changing the functional (see the Supporting Information).

Neither the original
kinetic model nor the modified one can explain
all of the experimental observations. First, addition of iron salt
leads to a much increased yield of the cross-coupling product (in
its absence, that is, with only alkyne, cyclohexyl iodide, and zinc
powder, only 34% of the product is formed, whereas with 10% FeBr2, this increases to 91%).27 The
reaction through TS2 should be able to proceed even without
iron, so this large effect on the yield is not well explained by the
original kinetic model. On the other hand, the product is formed (and
with a similar E:Z ratio), albeit
with low yield, in the absence of the iron additive, so an iron-free
mechanism must be taken into account when discussing possible mechanisms.
Also, good yields of cross-coupling products, with roughly the same
13:1 Z:E ratio, are obtained with
CuBr2 or CrCl2 additives in place of FeBr2.

Discussion
Modeling reactions of this type using quantum
chemical methods
is extremely challenging. The fundamental reason for this is the extreme
complexity of the reaction mixture, involving different oxidation,
spin and solvation states of the iron catalyst, and a solid zinc coreagent.
This means that mechanism prediction needs to consider many different
sorts of species and treat them in an accurate and balanced way. This
is arguably too challenging at the present time, although the present
work contains suggestions for dealing with two issues. First, we suggest
the use of experimental thermodynamic data for solid and gaseous zinc
metal as a way to bridge the gap between the quantum chemical models
of the molecular-zinc-containing species and the experimental presence
of solid zinc. Second, we suggest that the Marcus equation can be
used as a way to combine experimental data for a model reaction and
computationally derived reaction energies to estimate rate constants
for reactions taking place at the solid zinc surface.

Based
on the quantum chemical free energies and the kinetic model,
the preferred mechanism appears to be as shown in the top part of Figure 5, with zinc affecting
reduction of the carbon–halide bond in the reagent, with the
resulting radical then adding to the alkyne to form a vinyl radical
product P0, which is then trapped as a vinyl-zinc species.
An alternative route involving C–C bond formation through formation
of the diiron intermediate 13 and then the reductive
elimination is predicted to be significantly less favorable. This
second possibility can only be made to be favored upon carrying out
rather large adjustments to the quantum chemical free energies.

As mentioned at the end of the previous section, though, the kinetic
model does not reproduce one key experimental observation, whereby
addition of an iron salt enhances the yield of the reaction quite
considerably, from 34 to 91%. One possible explanation is that the
bimetallic mechanism occurs instead or as well, which would require
similar mechanisms to also be competitive in the case of copper or
chromium catalysts.

Another possibility is that the mechanism
is more complex than
either model suggested here. We have modeled some of the diversity
of species that could be formed under the reaction conditions, but
in fact the possible speciation range is much broader than what we
have modelled. Charged species (the solvent used is quite polar) or
some types of clusters could for example play a role. Another possibility
is heterogeneous chemistry: so far, we have considered as possible
redox partners the alkyl iodide, the iron salt, and various intermediate
iron complexes. In each case, we have assumed that reduction leads
to a solution-phase molecular species together with a zinc salt. However,
more complex processes can occur on the zinc surface, with formation
of adsorbed partly reduced species such as low-valent iron. Such species
may play important roles and thereby modify the chemistry occurring
in the presence of solid zinc only. For example, the presence of iron
atoms at the zinc surface could accelerate the reduction of the C–X
bond, leading to faster formation of cyclohexyl radicals. More complex
effects, whereby iron at the surface could change the competition
between formation of cyclohexyl radicals, which then add to alkyne
over TS2, and formation of zinc-bound cyclohexyl, which
does not react under the experimental conditions, are also possible.
Such effects go well beyond what can be modeled in the present work.

Computational Details
The mechanistic study of the
iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction
between phenylacetylene and cyclohexyl iodide in the N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) solvent has been computationally
explored using density functional theory with Gaussian09 rev. E01.63 Geometry optimization was performed employing
the hybrid functional B3LYP38 including
the empirical dispersion correction with Becke and Johnson damping
D3BJ.64 The Pople basis set 6-31g(d)65 for O, N, C, and H and the Stuttgart basis set
SDD66 with the associated effective core
potential (ECP) for Zn, Fe, I, and Br (BS1) were used.
Improved electronic energies at the optimized structures were obtained
by recalculating the energy using the same B3LYP-D3BJ functional while
also including scalar relativistic effects by using the Douglas–Kroll–Hess
Hamiltonian (DKH)67,68 and using an expanded basis set
consisting of aug-cc-pwCVQZ-DK for the metal center and aug-cc-pVTZ-DK
for every other atom except for H where cc-pVDZ-DK was used (BS2).69−71 This method has been validated in two ways, described
in detail in the Supporting Information. First, we computed the reaction energy for the key Fe(II) to Fe(I)
reduction step for a model system: FeCl2(DMF)2 + 1/2 Zn(0) + DMF → FeCl(DMF)2 + 1/2 ZnCl2(DMF)2 using the same B3LYP-D3BJ protocol as described
above and with CCSD(T)72−74 with an extended basis set. The agreement is better
than 2 kcal/mol. Next, for most of the key species, single-point energies
with the other DFT functionals MN1575 and
M06L76 have been computed, and the resulting
relative energies were compared. These other functionals, especially
M06L, perform somewhat less well for the CCSD(T) benchmark and hence
have not been used in our main analysis. They do provide some independent
validation, though, because especially MN15 yields relative predicted
energies close to those obtained with B3LYP-D3BJ, typically within
6 kcal/mol on average. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed
at the same level of theory as used for geometry optimization and
were used to define the nature of the stationary points (minima and
TSs) involved in the reaction mechanism and to obtain zero-point and
thermal energy corrections at 298.16 K. The free energy correction
applied to the electronic energy was calculated using the quasi-harmonic
approach as suggested by the Truhlar group77 with a cutoff for a small vibrational frequency of 100 cm–1. Also, we used the solution-phase standard state of 1 mol/L instead
of the gas-phase 1 atm used by default in Gaussian. For the DMA solvent,
the standard state used was the pure liquid, with a concentration
of 10.76 mol/L. Kinetic simulations were done by using the software
Tenua.61 The presence of a solvent (DMA)
has been also considered by treating explicitly the solvent molecules
but also implicitly with the continuum solvent SMD.78

Conclusions
The iron-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling
reaction between phenyl
acetylene and cyclohexyl iodine in the presence of solid zinc has
been extensively explored with computational methods. A mechanistic
scheme suggested in the original experimental study has been examined,
as well as a number of variants. Two broadly plausible mechanisms
have been put forward based on quantum chemical investigations, as
well as new models for treating the free energy change of reactions
involving solid zinc. The first mechanism is a modified form of the
mechanism suggested in the experimental study, whereby the cyclohexyl
iodide species undergoes reduction not by reduced Fe(I) species but
by metallic zinc. The second is a mechanism involving formation of
a diiron-alkene species through addition of two iron moieties to the
alkyne followed by reductive elimination. Both of these pathways involve
relatively modest free energy barriers and can be used to account
for the Z-selectivity of the reaction.

However,
discriminating between the two mechanisms based on quantum
chemical data alone is not possible, and this motivated the second
large part of the study, based on integration of the kinetic equations
to obtain models of the reaction course. This modeling shows that,
based on the raw quantum chemical free energy values, the first mechanism
is significantly favored, and quite large adjustments to the free
energies would be needed in order to make the second mechanism dominant.
Such adjustments could in principle be required to take into account
errors in the quantum chemical methodology.

In our discussion,
we suggest that several experimental features
of the reaction make the interpretation of the results even more challenging.
Most importantly, the reaction leads to the same products (albeit
with much lower yields) even in the absence of iron salts, and good
yields of the same products can be obtained when replacing the iron
catalyst by chromium or copper salts. We suggest that this pattern
of reactivity is possibly explained by assuming that the reaction
follows a pathway that is similar to the first mechanism proposed
here based on quantum chemistry, with initial formation of a cyclohexyl
radical upon reductive cleavage of the C–I bond. However, the
detailed mechanism and outcome of this reductive step are suggested
to be sensitive to the presence of metal salts at the zinc surface.
This type of effect has been discussed elsewhere, for example, in
the context of heterogeneous single-atom catalysis79 or in the context of “cocktail-type” systems
at the borderline between homogeneous and heterogeneous chemistry.80

Overall, our study starts out from the
methods of quantum chemistry
as typically applied to homogeneous catalytic reactions to try to
describe a modern catalytic synthetic transformation that also includes
many important heterogeneous steps. The study not only includes a
number of techniques for handling the complexity introduced by heterogeneous
steps but also points toward the need for enhanced theories at the
borderlines of theoretical homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic
chemistry.
