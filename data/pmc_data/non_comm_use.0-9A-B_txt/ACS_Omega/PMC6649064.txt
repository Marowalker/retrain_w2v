Mechanical properties
of materials can be altered significantly
by the ancient art of kirigami. We study the mechanical properties
of atomically thin kirigami membranes of MoS2 using molecular
dynamics simulations. Nanoindentation simulations are performed to
study the mechanical response of rectangular and hexagonal kirigami
structures. Dramatic changes are observed in the ductility of monolayer
kirigami MoS2 compared with those of a pristine MoS2 monolayer. Load–displacement curves of kirigami structures
exhibit negligible hysteresis, and kirigami structures display remarkable
elastic recovery upon unloading. Defects formed at the edges and corners
of kirigami structures play an important role in the mechanical response
of the membranes.

1 Introduction
Kirigami
is an ancient art of paper cutting, two-dimensional (2D)
layered materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides,
which are known to be as flexible as paper. Exploiting their flexibility,
several research groups have recently applied kirigami to these 2D
materials and made three-dimensional structures with exceptional mechanical
and electrical properties.1−6 For example, Blees et al. created graphene-based devices with two
types of kirigami patterns: pyramid spiral spring and alternating
offset cuts.7 Their measurements of mechanical
and electrical properties indicate the flexibility of kirigami graphene
devices.

The flexibility of 2D materials is best characterized
by the Föppl–von
Kármán number8,9, where Y2D represents
the 2D Young’s modulus of the material, κ is the out-of-plane
bending stiffness, and L2 is the area
of the 2D material. Blees et al. have performed experimental analysis
to obtain γ for graphene.7 They find
a large value of γ in the range of 105–107. We have estimated γ for a MoS2 monolayer
using the values of κ and the 2D Young’s modulus (Y2D = Yh, where h is the thickness of the sample and Y is Young’s
modulus) calculated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the
reactive empirical bond-order (REBO) force field.10,11 The simulations by Xiong and Cao give κ to be around 10 eV
and Y around 200 GPa.12 With these values, the Föppl–von Kármán
number for a 100 × 100 nm2 sheet of MoS2 is around 1.2 × 106, which is close to the value
of γ for a standard sheet of paper. Such a large value of γ
indicates that kirigami patterns can be created experimentally with
a MoS2 monolayer membrane.

We created two types of
kirigami patterns in a monolayer of MoS2 and examined the
mechanical responses of those structures
to nanoindentation by MD simulations. Nanoindentation is an important
experimental technique to study the mechanical properties of materials
at the nanoscale.13−16 Bertolazzi et al. performed nanoindentation experiment to measure
the mechanical strength of single and bilayer MoS2.17 They find that in-plane stiffness and breaking
strength of ultrathin MoS2 are comparable to those of stainless
steel. Stewart and Spearot performed MD simulation to study nanoindentation
on the basal plane of thin MoS2.1818 They investigated the incipient plastic
deformation and found the local phase transformation using a slip
vector analysis. Tan et al. have performed MD simulation to study
the deflection dependence of monolayer graphene and obtain Young’s
modulus from indentation.19

Recently,
a few experimental studies and MD simulations of 2D kirigami
materials have also been reported. Shyu et al. reported a controlled
kirigami patterning technique to engineer the elasticity of nanocomposite
sheets.20 They claim to have significantly
improved the tensile capability of the stretchable conductor nanosheets
and the electrical properties of the composites. Hanakata et al. have
performed MD simulations to investigate the density and length of
overlapping kirigami patterns in MoS2 nanoribbon.21 They find significant enhancement of tensile
ductility and fracture strains of kirigami structures.

2 Computational Methods
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
are performed to study the
nanoindentation response of MoS2 in the presence of kirigami
patterns. We use reactive empirical bond-order (REBO) potential to
model the interaction between Mo and S atoms in MoS2.10 The REBO potential accounts for changes in local
atomic configurations of atoms. The binding energy of Mo–S
system is expressed as 1  where fijc is a cutoff
function, rij is the
atomic distance between atoms i and j, bij is a bond-order
function, and A, B, Q, α, and β are parameters for pairwise interactions.

In the work reported here, we use a conical diamond indenter (see Figure S1) in the MD simulations. To account
for the size effect of the indenter, three indenter tips with diameters
of 6, 9, and 12 nm are used in the simulations. The interaction between
the indenter and MoS2 kirigami structures is described
by Lennard-Jones potentials between C, Mo, and S atoms.22 However, to avoid the attraction between the
indenter and MoS2, we only keep the 12th-order repulsive
term of the potential. The parameters including potential depth ϵij, characteristic length σij, and cutoff are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

We created hexagonal
(H) and square (S) kirigami patterns of various
sizes in a MoS2 monolayer of size 100 × 100 nm2 (see Figure S1). The patterns
are created by removing specific Mo and S atoms in the monolayer MoS2 nanosheets. The size of the MoS2 nanosheet is
chosen so that it is much larger than the indenter size. After equilibrating
the system at 300 K for 5 million MD time steps (time step is 1 fs),
the load is applied gradually. The indenter is pushed toward the center
of the MoS2 monolayer for 1 nm at the rate of 10 m/s. Subsequently,
the system is relaxed for 0.2 million MD steps while the indenter
is held fixed, and the average force is calculated during the holding
phase. Periodic boundary conditions are applied parallel to the x–y plane, i.e., the basal plane
of the MoS2 structure. A 10 nm-wide peripheral region of
MoS2 is kept frozen to mimic a rigid platform. Along the z-direction, we use free boundary condition on both sides
of MoS2. The equations of motion for all atoms are integrated
with the velocity-Verlet algorithm.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a displays
the MD results for the load as a function of indenter displacement,
i.e., indentation depth for kirigami structures with hexagonal (H)
pattern of varying sizes. The patterns shown in panels Figure 1b–d cover, respectively,
4.1, 12.7, and 26.0% of the total area of the indented MoS2 monolayer. The load–displacement curves, green, blue, and
red corresponding to patterns in Figure 1b–d, indicate how the mechanical response
changes with the area of kirigami patterns. Here, the maximum load
is chosen to be just below the critical value at which the structure
fractures. For the same applied load, the indentation depth increases
almost linearly with the area of the kirigami pattern. The load-bearing
capacity of kirigami structures increases significantly with the area
of kirigami patterns. The maximum indentation depth for the smallest
pattern (Figure 1b)
is 15 nm and it increases to 30 and 55 nm for kirigami structures
shown in Figure 1c,d.
This indicates that these structures are much more flexible than the
pristine MoS2 monolayer. Furthermore, these structures
exhibit very little hysteresis in the load–displacement curves
and suffer less damage than the pristine MoS2 monolayer.

Figure 1 (a) Load–displacement
curves for nanoindentation on MoS2 with three kirigami
structures of different area fractions.
As a reference, the response of the MoS2 monolayer without
the kirigami structure is shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. The green curve is the indentation
response curve of the kirigami pattern shown in (b). The blue and
red curves correspond to patterns shown in (c) and (d). The arrows
in (a) pointing upward and downward indicate loading and unloading
processes, respectively. The hysteresis in the load–displacement
curves indicates irreversible damage in MoS2 kirigami structures
during nanoindentation. The MoS2 kirigami pattern in (d)
can be indented much more with a smaller load than the pristine MoS2 monolayer.

Figure 1a shows
that the hysteresis in the load–displacement curves remains
nearly the same for structures (b) and (c). The hysteresis increases
for the largest kirigami structure. This trend in hysteresis indicates
that kirigami structures (b) and (c) have the same degree of plastic
deformation, whereas the largest kirigami structure has undergone
more plastic deformation and perhaps other kinds of defects have also
formed in the system as a result of much larger indentation depth.

Evidently, increasing the area of kirigami pattern has a significant
effect on the out-of-plane hardness of MoS2. We have calculated
the hardness of these kirigami structures from , where Pmax is the maximum applied load
and A is the effective
indented area. Knowing A and Pmax, we find that the hardness decreases from 40.9 to 23.6
and 11.5 MPa as the kirigami area fraction increases from 4.1 to 12.7
and 26.0%. These values are much smaller than the hardness 519.6 MPa
for a pristine MoS2 monolayer.

We have calculated
elastic modulii EY for these three structures
from , where S, the slope of
the load–displacement curve at the maximum load upon unloading,
also represents the stiffness of the MoS2 kirigami structure.
The values of S are 6.4, 3.7, and 1.8 N/m, respectively,
for kirigami patterns (b)–(d). The quantity β accounts
for the shape correction factor of the indenter, which is 1.0 for
the conical indenter we use in the simulations. The elastic moduli
for kirigami structures shown in panels (b)–(d) are 141.2,
81.6, and 39.7 MPa, respectively.

Figure 2a displays
the MD results for the load as a function of indenter displacement
in MoS2 with square (S) kirigami patterns. The patterns
shown in panels (b)–(d) cover, respectively, 5.4, 13.3, and
24.7% of the total area of the affected MoS2 surface. Again,
we observe that the out-of-plane flexibility of kirigami structures
increases with the area of kirigami patterns. The maximum indentation
depth before the failure of MoS2 is 16 nm for the pattern
shown in Figure 2c,
while the indenter can go as deep as 38 nm for the pattern in Figure 2d before cracks develop
at the corners of the pattern.

Figure 2 (a) Load–displacement curves for
nanoindentation on square
MoS2 kirigami patterns shown in (b)–(d). The upward
and downward arrows in each curve indicate loading and unloading processes,
respectively. The areas of kirigami patterns in (b)–(d) are
5.4, 13.3, and 24.7%, respectively, of the total area of the MoS2 monolayer. As in the case of hexagonal kirigami patterns,
the hysteresis and hardness decrease significantly with an increase
in the kirigami area.

The hardness of the three H kirigami patterns decreases from
42.6
to 10.5 MPa as the kirigami area increases from 5.4 to 24.7%. These
values are again more than an order of magnitude smaller than that
of a pristine MoS2 monolayer but similar to the hardness
of H patterns shown in Figure 1b–d.

The trend in Young’s modulus for
the three H structures
confirms the similarity with S patterns. The hardness values are 7.3,
3.4, and 1.8 N/m, respectively, for kirigami patterns (b)–(d)
in Figure 2. The elastic
moduli for kirigami structures shown in panels (b)–(d) are
147.6, 68.8, and 36.3 MPa, respectively, very similar to Young’s
moduli of H kirigami structures shown in Figure 1.

We have investigated the effect of
the indenter size on the mechanical
response of the largest kirigami structures, where the area of the
kirigami pattern is ∼25% of the total area of the MoS2 monolayer. As shown in Figure 3, three conical indenters of diameters 60, 90, and
120 Å were used in the simulations. The load–displacement
curves for hexagonal and square patterns are shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. In the case
of the H pattern, the effect of the indenter size is insignificant
for indentation depths of 30 Å. Beyond that indentation depth,
the force is larger for larger indenters in both the loading and unloading
cycles. The hardness, elastic modulus, and stiffness for the three
indenter sizes are listed in Table S2 in
the Supporting Information. The load–displacement curves for
the S kirigami structure are nearly the same for the three indenters,
which implies that the indenter size has an insignificant effect on
elastic properties, plastic deformation, and defect generation in
S kirigami structures.

Figure 3 Effect of the indenter size on the two MoS2 kirigami
structures. (a) Load vs indentation depth for the hexagonal kirigami
structure indented with indenters of radii 30, 45, and 60 Å.
(b) Load vs indentation depth curves for the square kirigami structure
indented with the same set of indenters. The area fractions of kirigami
patterns in panels (a) and (b) are ∼25%.

As each indenter is retracted, the force on the indenter
due to
MoS2 deformation reduces to zero slowly. This indicates
that the MoS2 membrane is in contact with the indenter
during unloading. The hysteresis indicates plastic deformation in
kirigami structures even after the indenter is completely retracted.
The indenter force at each indentation depth is more or less the same
for different indenter sizes, which implies that the indenter size
has an insignificant effect on the results. The elastic force arises
mostly from the deformation of kirigami pattern outside the area of
direct contact with the conical indenter.

The kirigami structures
are extremely flexible and can withstand
large strains and stresses without succumbing to fracture or failure.
We have calculated stress distribution in kirigami membranes at various
indentation depths. Figure 4 shows the stress distributions in hexagonal and square kirigami
membranes indented with the same indenter of diameter 60 Å. The
area fractions of these membranes are nearly the same (∼25%). Figure 4a,b shows the snapshots
of hexagonal and square membranes under maximum loads. Above these
loads, the ligaments of kirigami structures fracture and the membranes
collapse. At the maximum applied loads, the indentation depth for
the hexagonal (55 nm) structure is larger than that of the square
(38 nm) kirigami structure. Stress distributions in the hexagonal
and square kirigami structures at maximum applied loads are shown
in Figure 4c,d. These
are atomic-level stresses calculated from the virial expression for
the stress tensor (see the Supporting Information). The stresses are compressive and large in the ligaments and corners
of both kirigami patterns. The square pattern is evidently under larger
compressive stress than the hexagonal kirigami structure. The stresses
are negligible outside the kirigami patterns.

Figure 4 Stress distribution in
the deformed MoS2 membrane. (a)
and (c) are side views of the deformed MoS2 kirigami structures.
MoS2 layers form an elastic pyramid spring under nanoindentation
(the indenter is removed from the view for better visualization of
MoS2). Stress is accumulated symmetrically around the corners
and arms of kirigami patterns and goes up to 10 GPa. Panels (b) and
(d) show the top views of deformed MoS2 under nanoindentation.
(Stress is calculated using per-atom volume and per-atom stress tensor
averaged over 0.2 million MD steps).

Beyond the elastic regime, compressive stresses tend to affect
the corners and ligaments more than the rest of hexagonal and square
kirigami patterns. Figure 5a shows the atomic configurations at a corner of a hexagonal
kirigami structure before (left panel) and after (middle panel) indentation. Figure 5b presents the close-up
views of a corner in the square kirigami structure before (left panel)
and after (middle panel) indentation. As the applied load is increased,
stresses weaken Mo–S bonds in the corner regions. Close to
the maximum applied load, large compressive stresses break Mo–S
bonds in both hexagonal and square kirigami structures. Most of the
broken bonds are at the corners and a few of them in the ligaments
of the kirigami patterns. These broken bonds give rise to point defects
and nanoscale cracks. These defects do not heal upon unloading, and
nanocracks also remain at the corners of kirigami patterns. We have
estimated the density of defects by monitoring the number of broken
bonds in the kirigami structures both during loading and unloading
phases. These results are presented in Figure 5c. Blue curves show how the defect density
increases upon loading in the hexagonal kirigami structure. The flat
portion of the blue curve indicates that the defect density remains
constant in the unloading phase. The lower red curve shows how the
defect density increases with an increase in the applied load, and
the upper red curve shows that the defect density remains constant
during the entire unloading phase. Thus, the indentation leaves permanent
damage in the kirigami structures.

Figure 5 Evolution of defects induced by nanoindentation
in MoS2 kirigami structures. (a) Close-up views of a corner
in a hexagonal
kirigami pattern before indentation (left panel) and after indentation
(middle panel). There are broken bonds and a nanocrack at the corner
after the indenter is removed and the system is relaxed. (b) shows
irreversible damage caused by indentation in a square kirigami structure.
The left panel shows the atomic configuration at a corner of the square
kirigami pattern before indentation. The middle panel is a close-up
view of the same corner after indentation. Point defects shown in
the middle panel persist even after the indenter has completely retracted
and the kirigami structure has been relaxed for 2 million MD steps.
The defect density in the two systems is shown in (c). Blue curves
represent defect density in the hexagonal kirigami structure in Figure 1d during loading
(lower curve) and unloading (flat upper curve) phases. Red curves
in (c) show the defect density during loading and unloading in the
square kirigami structure in Figure 2d.

4 Conclusions
In this simulation, we have created two kirigami patterns in the
MoS2 monolayer and investigated the nanoindentation response
of these structures with different area fractions. We find that both
hexagonal and square kirigami patterns can dramatically modulate the
rigidity of a MoS2 monolayer. A kirigami pattern with around
25% area of the MoS2 membrane can reduce the out-of-plane
stiffness by more than 10 times. The indenter size effect is insignificant
since most of the deformation appears at ligaments and corners of
the kirigami patterns and not where the indenter is directly in contact
with the MoS2 membrane. We have also identified two types
of defects in the kirigami structure, which prevented complete recovery
of the MoS2 membrane from the nanoindentation and introduced
hysteresis in the load–displacement curve for all of the kirigami
MoS2 structures. We also propose nanoindentation experiment
on this novel kirigami structures in the monolayer MoS2 membrane.
