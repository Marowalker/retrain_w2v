Interactions between biomolecules
are generally analyzed by ensemble
measurements, assuming that the interactions occur in a single binding
manner. However, such interactions may occur via multiple binding
modes. We investigated the kinetics of DNA hybridization as a multiple
dynamic model of biomolecular interactions. Two kinetic analyses were
performed with a single-molecule observation using total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and with ensemble measurements
using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor. We observed the
DNA hybridization of 8 and 12 bp DNAs with random sequences and dA12–dT12 and calculated the kinetic parameters,
including the dissociation rate constant (koff). Hybridization of 8 bp DNA proceeded mainly via a single binding
mode. However, hybridization of 12 bp DNA indicated at least two different
binding modes and dA12–dT12 hybridization
showed multiple binding modes. For the multiple binding interactions,
the kinetic parameters obtained from TIRFM and QCM were different
because kinetic parameters obtained from QCM indicate average number
of molecules, whereas those from TIRFM indicate average association
time. The present study revealed the details of multiple interactions,
which can be utilized for better understanding of not only DNA hybridization
but also biomolecular interaction mechanisms.

Introduction
Biomolecular interactions
influence biological functions and are
more complex than chemical reactions owing to molecular conformational
changes and fluctuations among biological macromolecules.1,2 Therefore, investigating kinetic biomolecular interactions is required
to understand biological systems in detail. Biosensors, such as a
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, have been used for quantitative
analysis of reaction kinetics as well as binding association.3 A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor
can also be used for quantitative kinetic analysis. A host molecule-immobilized
QCM enables the detection of interactions with guest molecules as
a function of time because the resonance frequency decreases linearly
with the increase in mass on the sensor surface at the nanogram level.4,5 Kinetic analysis yields the association and dissociation rate constants
and dissociation constants (kon, koff, and Kd, respectively).
We have previously used a 27 MHz QCM device to study the kinetics
of DNA–DNA,6 DNA–protein,7 DNA–intercalator,8 and other biomolecules.9−11 However, biosensors including
SPR and QCM detect the total amount of substance on the sensing area,
resulting in an ensemble measurement of the binding/dissociation behaviors.
Hence, it is difficult to assess the behavior of each biomolecule
during interactions via multiple binding modes, resulting from conformational
fluctuations, using an ensemble measurement.

Experimental methods
designed for single-molecule detection can
be utilized to identify the binding mode of each molecule. Atomic
force microscopy and optical tweezers are emerging as powerful tools
to detect a single-molecule event.12 Furthermore,
single-molecule detection targeting DNA molecules, whose physical
properties are well defined among biomolecules, has been reported
as follows. Protein nanopores such as α-hemolysin13,14 and porin A15 have gained attention as
a single-molecule analytical tool for DNA detection and sequencing.
Previously, an array of femtoliter-sized reaction vessels was utilized
to detect the single-molecule DNA hybridization by enzymatic signal
amplification.16 In addition, localized
SPR17 and micromechanical technique18 were used for in situ sensing of single binding
events of nanoparticle-labeled DNA strands. Carbon nanotube field-effect
transistor provided information about the single-molecule binding
and dissociation of DNA hybridization in terms of activation energy.19

Total internal reflection fluorescence
microscopy (TIRFM) was developed
to observe a single-molecule behavior using a fluorescence labeling
technique.20 In TIRFM, the guest molecules
labeled with a fluorescent dye can be detected in the range of an
evanescent field on a glass plate immobilized with the host molecules.
A bright spot derived from the single-molecule interaction is detected
by using a high-sensitivity charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, with
a time resolution of several tens of frames per second. Single-molecule
DNA hybridization was detected by TIRFM using molecular beacon DNA
probe,21 a dual-color system,22 liposome-mediated delivery of DNA-modifying
fluorescent molecules,23,24 and a competitive assay with
fluorescence-labeled and label-free DNA.25 Although such single-molecule detections of biomolecular interactions
provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of biomolecules, the
difference in kinetics of the biomolecular interactions via a multiple
dynamic binding mode at a single-molecule level remains unclear.

In this study, we focused on the kinetic analysis of biomolecular
interactions with multiple binding modes at a single-molecule level.
In previous studies, kinetics of biomolecular interactions with ensemble
measurements have been generally analyzed with the assumption that
the biomolecular interactions occur in a single binding manner, which
results in the average rate constants of the multiple binding behaviors.
Therefore, we obtained a single-molecule observation, using TIRFM;
thereafter, we compared the resulting kinetic parameters with those
obtained with an ensemble measurement, using QCM to consider the meaning
of averaging. We demonstrate the kinetic analysis of multiple dynamic
binding modes of DNA hybridization, as a multiple binding model of
biomolecular interactions. DNAs with multiple binding behavior in
DNA hybridization can be designed because that depends on the length
and sequence of DNA.26 We used the DNA
modified with the small fluorescent probe Cy3, which causes comparatively
less steric hindrance, at 5′-end of the DNA strands (Figure 1A). We monitored
the DNA hybridization and dissociation as appearance/disappearance
time of bright spots in real-time by TIRFM and conducted the statistical
analysis to obtain the kinetic parameters (Figures 1B,C, and 2). The resultant
kinetic parameters were compared with those obtained from the QCM
measurement. The details of multiple interactions could be utilized
for better understanding of different biological functions in the
living cell.

Results and Discussion
Experimental System for
Monitoring DNA Hybridization by TIRFM
We first examined DNA
immobilization on a glass plate in TIRFM
experiments. DNA sequences used in this study are represented in Figure 1A. A reaction cell
for DNA hybridization was made by attaching a cover glass on a slide
glass with a hole, which can contain a sample solution (70 μL)
as shown in Figure 1B. The amount of probe DNA immobilized on the glass plate of TIRFM
needs to be controlled at low density for the detection of DNA hybridization
at a single-molecule level. To obtain one bright spot corresponding
to one fluorescent-labeled DNA molecule by the CCD camera (resolution:
160 nm × 160 nm/pixel), 70 μL of the 10 pM probe-DNA solution
containing 4.2 × 108 DNA molecules was used to construct
the DNA-displayed glass plate (area: 1.13 cm2). In case
of maximum immobilization, the distance between the probe DNAs was
calculated to be 554 nm (occupied area: 2.7 × 105 nm2/probe-DNA molecule). The immobilization amount is low enough
for one probe DNA to be located per ∼10 pixels of the CCD camera
to obtain one fluorescent-labeled DNA per pixel.

Single-Molecule
Observation of DNA Hybridization
We
observed the DNA hybridization of Cy3-labeled DNAs with probe DNA
on the glass plate of the reaction cell by TIRFM (Figure 1C). When the reaction cell
with the probe DNA (8 mer) was filled with 70 μL of 1 nM Cy3-labeled
target-DNAs (8 mer) solution, we found many countable bright spots
in the CCD-camera image (Figure S1A). However,
in the case of no probe-DNA immobilization, very few bright spots
were observed from the Cy3-labeled target DNAs displaying nonspecific
binding with the plate in the same condition (Figure S1B). These results indicate that (1) the Cy3-labeled
DNAs bound to probe DNAs, (2) the Cy3 fluorescent dye emitted fluorescence
by evanescent light, and (3) its emission was detected with the CCD
camera (Figure 2).

Next, we obtained the CCD-camera images continuously at 30 s intervals,
resulting in the movies showing many blinking spots. The intensity
of a blinking spot in one area of the images was plotted against time
in the case of a single-molecule hybridization of 8 mer–8 mer,
12 mer–12 mer, and dA12–dT12 (Figure 3). They showed short
or long pulses. The similar intensity of the short or long pulses
in each graph reflected fluorescent emission from one molecule of
Cy3-labeled target DNA. Thus, a high-intensity step in contrast to
the baseline would indicate DNA hybridization, and the duration of
the step shows the association time for binding between the target
DNA and the probe DNA. We found that the association time of the hybridization
in 8 mer–8 mer was shorter than that in 12 mer–12 mer
(Figure 3A,B). In addition,
the association time in dA12–dT12 seemed
to be a mixture of short and long pulses (Figure 3C). These results suggest that the association
time depends on the DNA length and that hybridization in dA12–dT12 could occur between DNA strands with various
lengths.

to the binding and dissociation of single-molecule hybridization in
(A) 8 mer–8 mer, (B) 12 mer–12 mer, and (C) dA12–dT12 DNAs. Time-lapse images were obtained at
an interval of 30 s. Experimental conditions: 200 mM NaCl Tris-EDTA
(TE) buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 200 mM NaCl) [Cy3-DNA] = 1 nM at 20 °C.

Histogram Analysis of Time-Lapse Images of
TIRFM
We
analyzed the movies obtained from the time-lapse images of each single-molecule
hybridization to obtain the association time. According to eq 6, we plotted ln(counts/n) against association time (ta) for 8 mer–8 mer, 12 mer–12 mer, and dA12–dT12 (Figure 4A–C). For comparison, each vertical axis was
normalized with the maximum value of (counts/n) of
1. We drew a straight line on the plots for 8 mer–8 mer hybridization
according to the theoretical formula (eq 6) (Figure 4A). The slope corresponding to an apparent dissociation rate
constant (koff′) was 0.013 s–1. In contrast, we could not draw single straight line
in the plots for 12 mer–12 mer hybridization because a bimodal
distribution was found in the graph (Figure 4B). Therefore, we fitted the plots by two
straight lines. The values of the two slopes were 0.014 s–1, which was similar to that of the 8 mer–8 mer hybridization,
and a smaller value of 0.0016 s–1; this suggests
the existence of different binding modes (fast and slow dissociation
modes) in the 12 mer–12 mer hybridization. Moreover, in the
case of dA12–dT12, the plots showed a
hyperbolic curve, suggesting the existence of multiple binding modes
(Figure 4C). To analyze
the curve simply, we divided the plots into three areas expediently
and fitted with three straight lines with slopes 0.020, 0.0059, and
0.0028 s–1. The same tendency was found when hybridization
was observed using different time-lapse intervals in case of 8 mer–8
mer, 12 mer–12 mer, and dA12–dT12 DNA hybridization (Figures S2–S4, respectively).

Figure 4 Histogram analyses of association time for single-molecule
hybridization
of (A) 8 mer–8 mer, (B) 12 mer–12 mer, and (C) dA12–dT12 DNAs. Each vertical axis was normalized
with the maximum value of (counts/n) of 1. Slope
values were obtained according to eq 6 in Experimental Section. Time-lapse
images were obtained at an interval of 30 s. Experimental conditions:
200 mM NaCl TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 200
mM NaCl) [Cy3-DNA] = 1 nM at 20 °C.

Kinetic Analysis for Dissociation Rate Constants of DNA Hybridization
Irradiation with a strong laser for single-molecule detection in
TIRFM results in the quenching of the fluorescent probe at a certain
frequency.27 Therefore, the disappearance
of bright spots in the TIRFM images could be attributed to both dissociation
of fluorescence-labeled molecules from probe molecules on the plate
and the photobleaching of a fluorescent probe. To obtain the actual
dissociation rate constant (koff) from
the time-lapse TIRFM movies, we performed the histogram analysis with
various time-lapse intervals (τtl) under constant
exposure time (τex) for each hybridization (Figures 4, and S2–S4) and plotted the koff′·τtl values against the
τtl values, according to eq 7 (Figure 5). Each apparent koff′
for the single binding mode in the 8 mer–8 mer hybridization,
two binding modes in the 12 mer–12 mer hybridization, and three
binding modes in the dA12–dT12 hybridization
was obtained from each histogram and was plotted with each time-lapse
interval (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Time-lapse
interval plots to obtain actual koff values
for (A) 8 mer–8 mer, (B) 12 mer–12
mer, and (C) dA12–dT12 DNA hybridization
according to eq 7 in Experimental Section.

The actual koff values of each
case
were calculated from the linear plots as a slope of a fitted line
(koff for 8 mer–8 mer, kofffast and koffslow for 12 mer–12 mer, kofffast, koffmiddle, and koffslow for dA12–dT12). We also calculated
the average of koff values (koffavg) obtained by linear fitting of the entire
plots without dividing them into two or three (Table 1). Based on the results of DNA hybridization
using 8 and 12 bp DNAs, the koff values
decreased with increasing length. This is reasonable because higher
number of base pairs contributes to the stability of the hybridization,
resulting in a smaller dissociation rate constant. In the case of
12 mer–12 mer hybridization, the two koff values (kofffast and koffslow) should correspond
to two binding modes with different base-pair length: partial hybridization
(kofffast) and perfect hybridization
(koffslow). The kofffast and koffslow values for dA12–dT12 were similar to those for 12 mer–12 mer. The hybridized dA12–dT12 DNAs with the koffmiddle value could exist in 41% of the relative
abundance in the total dA12–dT12 hybridization.
Thus, these results suggest that the interaction mode in the hybridization
of dA12–dT12 may not only be partial
and perfect hybridization (kofffast and koffslow, respectively)
but may also include other types of bindings such as a zipperlike-mismatch
hybridization (koffmiddle)
(Figure 6).

QCM Measurements
of DNA Hybridization for Comparison with Those
from TIRFM
A QCM biosensor allows an ensemble measurement
of the binding and dissociation behaviors by detecting the total amount
of substance on the sensing area. We performed a kinetic measurement
for the DNA hybridization using a QCM technique with the condition
same as that used in the TIRFM experiments. The time-course curves
of the QCM frequency changes were based on the length of DNA and its
sequence during hybridization (Figure S5A,C,E). We calculated the kinetic parameters kon, koff, and Kd from these results according to eqs 10–12 (Figure S5B,D, and F, Table 2). The koff values of the
8 and 12 bp DNA hybridization from QCM are similar to those from TIRFM.
However, the koff value for dA12–dT12 from QCM is larger than that from TIRFM.
We found that the kon and koff values of dA12–dT12 hybridization
were close to those of the 8 bp but not to 12 bp DNA hybridization.
This suggests that the binding of dA12–dT12 occurs mainly via zipperlike hybridization, detected by the QCM
device as a large mass volume. In contrast, the histogram of association
time in the TIRFM experiments should be fitted with a straight line
on the plots showing a longer association time (Figure 4). Thus, the kinetic parameters obtained
from an ensemble measurement, such as that using QCM, provide the
average number of molecules and those from single-molecule observation,
such as those via TIRFM, provide the average association time. Therefore,
the difference between the kinetic parameters obtained by QCM and
TIRFM could become more remarkable in case of interactions involving
various binding modes. We are interested in investigating whether
the multiple binding process occurring during cellular signal transduction
depends on the average number of molecules or on the average association
time.

from eqs 10–12 in Experimental Section and is reported with experimental errors. Experimental conditions:

Finally, we discussed the possibility
of DNA sliding via a zipperlike-mismatch
hybridization followed by perfect hybridization, which showed stability.
The kon value of the 12 mer DNA was smaller
than that of the 8 mer DNA because of the low probability of collision
required for perfect hybridization. In contrast, in dA12–dT12 hybridization, most of the target DNAs acted
as 8 bp DNAs corresponding to a zipperlike-mismatch hybridization
in the ensemble measurement of binding and dissociation behaviors
(Table 2), and a few
of the target DNAs acted as 12 bp corresponding to perfect hybridization
with koffslow (Table 1). We observed the DNA hybridization
using d(ATG)4 and d(CAT)4. We expected the block-like
hybridization to shift by 3 bases (Figure S5G,H). The kon value in d(ATG)4–d(CAT)4 was close to that of 8 mer–8 mer
(Table 2). Moreover,
the koff value was similar to that of
12 mer–12 mer. Collectively, these results suggest that target-d(CAT)4 binds with 6 or 9 bp region via an interaction corresponding
to the block-like mismatch hybridization (easy binding) and then proceeds
to full-match hybridization with the same Kd value as that of 12 bp DNA (stable binding). In the TIRFM observations
(Figures S6 and S7), bimodal linear-fitting
for the plots in the histogram was obtained for d(ATG)4–d(CAT)4 DNAs, indicating two dissociation modes
(partial and perfect hybridization) kinetically (Table 1). Thus, the dA12–dT12 hybridization indicates various binding/dissociation
modes due to the zipperlike hybridization with a slight sliding. However,
the d(ATG)4–d(CAT)4 hybridization showed
initial dangling behavior followed by sliding and stable (partial
and perfect) hybridization (Figure 6).

Conclusions
We observed hybridization
of DNA with various lengths and sequences
by two different methods: single-molecule observation using TIRFM
and ensemble measurement using QCM. The resultant kinetic parameters
obtained through TIRFM were compared with those obtained from QCM
measurement. Because the hybridization of 8 mer–8 mer DNA consisted
of a single binding mode, the hybridization of 12 mer–12 mer
DNA showed both fast and slow dissociation rate constants. In addition,
the hybridization of dA12–dT12 DNA showed
multiple binding modes. In the case of multiple binding interactions,
kinetic parameters obtained from QCM and TIRFM were different because
the kinetic parameters obtained from QCM and TIRFM indicate the average
number of molecules and average association time, respectively. Single-molecule
detection in addition to ensemble measurements of biomolecular interactions
presents more detailed information of the binding modes, which are
essential to understand biomolecules more precisely. We are interested
in assessing whether the biological function depends on the average
number of molecules or the average association time. It would be necessary
to clarify the correlation between single-molecule kinetics and biological
functions in situ.

followed by sonication for 20 min. The stain-free cover glass was

Single-Molecule Observation of DNA Hybridization
by TIRFM
A combination of an inverted fluorescence microscope
IX71 (Olympus
Co., Tokyo, Japan), an objective lens UApo N 100XOTIRF (Olympus Co.),
a Samba 532-nm laser unit (Cobolt Inc., Solna, Sweden), an Electron
Multiplier-CCD camera ImagEM (HAMAMATSU Photonics K.K., Shizuoka,
Japan) was used as a TIRFM system. A biotinylated probe-DNA-immobilized
cover glass of the reaction cell was placed in contact with the immersion
oil on the objective lens of TIRFM. The cover glass was irradiated
by a laser light at 532 nm from the lower side through the objective
lens, resulting in the generation of an evanescent field on the upper
surface of the glass plate (Figure 2A). When the Cy3-labeled target DNAs were added to
the buffer solution in the reaction cell, CCD-camera images were recorded
by laser irradiation with 60.53 ms exposure time. Cy3-labeled DNAs
hybridized with probe DNAs immobilized on the glass plate appeared
as bright spots in the images (Figure 2B). Time-lapse images were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30,
40, 60, and 70 s. Software MetaMorph was used for analyzing the resultant
images.

TIRFM Result-Based Kinetic Analysis of DNA Hybridization
The association time (ta) of Cy3-labeled
DNAs with probe DNAs on the substrate was evaluated as continuous
bright spots detected on the time-lapse images. ta depends on the binding affinity, and the distribution
of the ta can be analyzed statistically.

In general, the dissociation reaction of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
is expressed as eq 1. 1  The decrease in dsDNAs per unit time is proportional
to the abundance of dsDNAs with the dissociation rate constant (koff) as a proportionality constant, as shown
in eq 2. 2  By dividing
both sides of eq 2 by
the total amount of the DNA
immobilized on the substrate and using the probability PdsDNA (=[dsDNA]/[total amount of the DNA immobilized on
the substrate]), eq 3 can be derived as follows. 3  The probability P can adapt
not only to space in total molecules but also to time in a single
molecule from ergodicity. Thus, the probability PdsDNA(ta), which implies frequency
of a single dsDNA molecule hybridized with association time ta, is described by eqs 4 and 5 obtained by integrating eq 3 4   5  where A is an integration
coefficient.

In single-molecule TIRFM experiments, PdsDNA(ta) can be calculated
by dividing [counts]
by n, where [counts] is the number of bright spots
with association time ta and n is the total number of bright spots counted. Thus, eq 5 can be replaced with eq 6 6  Therefore, we can obtain the koff′ values from the slope of linear
plots obtained
by plotting ln(counts/n) against ta from eq 6.

In single-molecule TIRFM observation, quenching of bright
spots
occurs not only because of dissociation of fluorescence-labeled molecules
from an evanescent field but also because of the fluorescence bleaching
with laser light.27 Because the effect
of bleaching depends on laser exposure time (τex)
and a time-lapse interval (τtl) related to the irradiation
frequency, the actual dissociation rate constant (koff) is related to the apparent koff′ obtained from eq 6 by following eq 7(25) 7  where kb is the
photobleaching rate constant. We calculated the actual koff values using eq 7.

27 MHz QCM Measurements of DNA Hybridization for Comparison
of Kinetic Parameters
A 27 MHz QCM experiment was performed
to obtain the conventional kinetic parameters of DNA hybridization
for comparison with the kinetic parameters obtained from the single-molecule
observation in TIRFM. An AFFINIX Q4 system (Initium Co. Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) was used in this study. A sensor cell designed for the AFFINIX
Q4 system has a volume of 500 μL and is equipped with a quartz
plate (60 μm thick and 8.7 mm in diameter) with a gold electrode
of 5.7 mm2 area attached at the bottom of the cell. The
QCM measurements were performed as mentioned previously.3,8 Briefly, 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid was immobilized on a
cleaned gold electrode, and carboxylic acids were activated as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters on the surface using EDC and
NHS. NeutrAvidin was reacted with the activated esters on the QCM
plate in the HEPES buffer. The biotinylated DNA was immobilized on
the NeutrAvidin-immobilized QCM in the 200 mM NaCl TE buffer and frequency
changes (ΔFwater) were monitored
over time. When the ΔFwater value
corresponding to an amount of biotinylated DNA reached 100 Hz (a predetermined
value), 10 μM free biotin was added to regulate the immobilization
amount. After rinsing the biotinylated DNA-immobilized QCM cell with
200 mM NaCl TE buffer, frequency changes in QCM in response to the
addition of complementary DNA strands were measured over time.

Binding kinetics were analyzed using the time courses of frequency
decreases (mass increases), as described previously.3,8 Briefly, the binding mode of the hybridization is given by eq 8. 8  The amount of dsDNAs formed at time t after the injection is described by eqs 9–12. 9   10   11   12  The binding relaxation
time (τ) can
be calculated from the time course of Δm in
each concentration by a curve-fitting method based on eq 10. The kon and koff can be obtained from the slope
and intercept of the linear correlation of the reciprocal plot of
binding relaxation time (1/τ) against each concentration, using eq 11 (Figure S5). Kd values were calculated
from the obtained kon and koff values, using eq 12.
