In this study, we described in detail a combinatorial
enzymatic
synthesis approach to produce a series of unnatural long-chain β-branch
pyrones. We attempted to investigate the catalytic potential of a
highly promiscuous enzyme type III PKS to catalyze the non-decarboxylative
condensation reaction by two molecules of fatty acyl diketide-N-acetylcysteines (diketide-NACs) units. Two non-natural
long-chain (C16, C18) fatty acyl diketide-NACs
were prepared successfully for testing the ability of non-decarboxylative
condensation. In vitro, 12 novel naturally unavailable long-chain
β-branch pyrones were generated by one-pot formation and characterized
by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and high-resolution liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry. Interestingly, enzymatic
kinetics result displays that this enzyme exhibits the remarkable
compatibility to various non-natural long-chain substrates. These
results would be useful to deeply understand the catalytic mechanism
of this enzyme and further extend the application of enzymatic synthesis
of non-natural products.

1 Introduction
Combinatorial biosynthesis
helps to enrich the novelty and diversity
of the natural product architectures, offer an environmentally friendly
way to produce natural product analogs, and increase the titer of
the compound, eventually resulting in less expensive drugs.1−3 Enzymes are used in biocatalytic processes for the efficient and
sustainable production of pharmaceuticals, fragrances, fine chemicals,
and other products.4 Combinatorial enzymatic
synthesis is a green and efficient synthesis strategy compared with
traditional chemical synthesis. Combined with the utilization of non-natural
substrates and the nonspecificity of enzymes, enzymatic synthesis
achieves further evolution and ascension in combinatorial chemistry.5,6

Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are an important class of biologically
active and structurally diverse secondary metabolites in nature. Polyketides
are synthesized through decarboxylative condensation of two-carbon
acetate units by PKSs.7−11 According to their sequences, primary structures, and catalytic
mechanisms, PKSs fall into three groups: type I PKS, type II PKS,
and type III PKS.12−17 Type III PKS catalyzes sequential decarboxylative condensations
of malonyl-CoA with an aromatic or aliphatic CoA-linked starter molecule
without using the acyl carrier protein to produce a variety of biologically
active secondary metabolites.18,19 Despite their structural
simplicity, type III PKS produces a wide array of compounds such as
chalcones, pyrones, acridones, phloroglucinols, stilbenes, and resorcinolic
lipids.20,21

Recently, CsyB from Aspergillus oryzae is a unique type III PKS that
is involved in the biosynthesis of
short-chain product csypyrone B1. This is the first type III PKS that
performs not only the polyketide chain elongation by decarboxylative
condensation but also the condensation of two β-ketoacyl units
by non-decarboxylative condensation (Figure 1). Interestingly, a fatty acyl CoA binding
tunnel of a length of about 16 Å is located in its active center,
so it is a very likely hypothesis that more diversified start units,
in particular, a number of precursors of unnatural long-chain fatty
acyl diketide-NAC, would be accepted to form the novel non-natural
products by in vitro enzyme assays. Due to this, the I375F mutant
of CsyB can accept the C4–C9 fatty acyl
diketide-NAC substrates to synthesize the unnatural novel product,
while the wild type only accepts the C4–C7 fatty acyl diketide-NAC substrates.22 Therefore, for testing this hypothesis, the catalytic capability
and substrate diversity of the I375F mutant of CsyB were evaluated
for synthesis of the non-natural long-chain β-branch pyrones
in this paper.

Figure 1 Catalytic reaction of CsyB.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Expression and Purification of CsyB
The recombinant CsyB was expressed in Escherichia
coli as a fusion soluble protein with a His6-tag at
the C terminus and purified to homogeneity by a combination of Ni-affinity
chromatography. The purified His6-tag-fused CsyB protein migrated
as a single band with a molecular mass of 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which
agrees well with the calculated value of 45.2 kDa (Figure S1).

2.2 Synthesis of Different Length Diketide SNACs
For examination of the substrate selectivity of CsyB for fatty
acyl diketide-NACs with various lengths, short-chain (C4 to C10) and long-chain (C16 to C18) diketide-NACs were synthesized according to the published method22 (Scheme S1). The
synthetic C16 and C18 diketide-NAC compounds
were isolated, purified, and identified on a small scale. Based on
the high-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(HRLC–MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, C16 and C18 diketide-NACs had a molecular formula
of C22H41NO3S at m/z 400.2819 [M + H]+ (calcd for C22H41NO3S, 400.2807) and 428.3102 [M
+ H]+ (calcd for C24H45NO3S, 428.3120), respectively, and data of 1H and 13C NMR also were in accordance with their structures (Figure 2) (Figures S2–S7).

Figure 2 Substrates of diketide-NACs.

2.3 Enzymatic Synthesis of Unnatural Long-Chain
β-Branch Pyrones Using C16 Diketide-NAC
The CsyB-specific fatty acyl CoA binding tunnel is highly similar
to long-chain pyrone enzymes such as ORAS in Neurospora
crassa and PKS18 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.23,24 It is suggested that this enzyme may also
be able to accept a series of long-chain substrates such as ORAS and
PKS18, although its native substrates are short-chain. To test this
hypothesis, we performed the enzyme reactions using various lengths
of diketide-NAC thioesters as substrates. The in vitro enzyme assay
was carried out as previously described.

To check the substrate
diversity and tolerance, C16 diketide-NAC and several short-chain
diketide-NACs from C4 to C9 diketide-NACs were
used to synthesize the non-natural long-chain β-branch pyrones
by the purified CsyB mutant enzyme I375F by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) in vitro. The CsyB I375F catalyzed the coupling
reaction between one molecule of a short-chain (C4–C9) diketide-NAC and one molecule of long-chain C16 diketide-NAC to yield the six new products 1–6 with various lengths of acyl chains (Figure 3).

Figure 3 HPLC results of CsyB I375F with long-chain C16 diketide-NAC.

The HPLC result showed that six new peaks were
detected at 310
nm, which stood for specific absorption of β-branch pyrones.
Furthermore, for confirming the molecular weights (MWs) of new compounds,
these new peaks were measured by HRLC–MS. The result showed
that compound 1 had a molecular formula of C24H40O4 at m/z 393.2941 [M + H]+ (calcd for 24H40O4, 393.2927). Similarly, the molecular formulas and m/z of other five compounds 2–6 are summarized in Table 1.

2.4 Enzymatic Synthesis of Unnatural β-Branch
Pyrones Using C18 Diketide-NAC
For further testing
of the substrate diversity and tolerance, C18 diketide-NAC
and several short-chain diketide-NAC from C4 to C9 diketide-NACs were used to synthesize the non-natural long-chain
β-branch pyrones by the purified CsyB mutant enzyme I375F in
vitro. The CsyB I375F using one molecule of a short-chain (C4–C9) diketide-NAC and one molecule of long-chain
C18 diketide-NAC catalyzes coupling reactions to yield
the six products 7–12 with various
lengths of acyl chains (Figure 4). Furthermore, for confirming the MWs of new compounds, these
new peaks were measured by HRLC–MS. The result showed that
compound 7 had a molecular formula of C26H44O5 at m/z 420.3240
[M + H]+ (calcd for C26H44O5, 420.3226). Similarly, molecular formulas and m/z of other five compounds 8–12 are summarized in Table 1.

2.5 Kinetics Parameter Comparison between Short-Chain
and Long-Chain Diketide-NAC
The steady-state kinetics values
of the CsyB I375F mutants for C4–C6 diketide-NAC
substrates are summarized in Table 2 according to previous work. The kinetics parameters
for the reactions of C16–C18 diketide-NAC
substrates were also determined with the substrate C5 diketide-NAC.
Steady-state kinetics parameters were determined from the Lineweaver–Burk
plot method (Figures S8–S12).

Table 2 Steady-State Kinetics Parameters of
CsyB I375Fa
substrate	Km (mM)	kcat (min–1)	kcat/Km (s–1 M–1)	
C4 diketide-NAC	7.1 ± 2.6	37.2 ± 11.1	87.5	
C5 diketide-NAC	1.4 ± 0.6	8.7 ± 2.5	92.9	
C6 diketide-NAC	4.5 ± 1.6	32.9 ± 5.4	122.2	
C16 diketide-NAC	5.4 ± 1.8	42.8 ± 4.5	132.1	
C18 diketide-NAC	6.5 ± 2.1	52.9 ± 8.4	135.6	
a Data are presented as mean value
of three experiments ±SD.

The steady-state kinetics values of CsyB I375F for
long-chain diketide-NACs
were a little better than those of short-chain diketide-NACs. In addition,
C18 diketide-NAC has a bit stronger affinity than C16 diketide-NAC to enzyme in the long-chain diketide-NACs.
Furthermore, the kinetics parameters for different substrates reported
in Table 2 show that kcat instead of Km is the major parameter to be affected, while one would expect that
varying the carbon chain length of the substrate should mainly affect
substrate binding instead of chemical catalysis. The reason is quite
likely related to the catalytic mechanism of this KS class. Because
CsyB and other type III PKSs such as ORAS and PKS18 accept the various
lengths of fatty acyl-CoAs (or SNACs, a kind of CoA analog) by binding
the CoA or SNAC group as well as the fatty acyl group as shown in Figure 5. Therefore, these
enzymes exhibit the extensive substrate specificity for fatty acyl
diketide-NACs with various lengths, short chain (C4 to
C10) and long chain (C16 to C18).

3 Conclusions
CsyB, a novel fungal type
III polyketide synthase, can sequentially
accept one molecular of short-chain fatty acyl CoA as a start unit,
one molecular of malonyl-CoA, and one molecular of acetoacetyl-CoA
as an extend unit to produce the short-chain csypyrone B1–B3
in natural conditions. Because a fatty acyl CoA binding tunnel of
16 Å length is located in its active center, more diversified
start units are proposed to be accepted by CsyB. In order to attempt
to synthesize the long-chain β-branch pyrone, an in vitro enzyme
assay was done using a number of precursors of unnatural fatty acyl
SNAC using CsyB. The results of HPLC revealed that a series of long-chain
csypyrone derivatives were detected. These 12 new long-chain β-branch
pyrone compounds were preliminarily analyzed by UV–visible
spectroscopy and HRLC–MS. By comparing the enzymatic kinetics
parameters of the long- and short-chain substrates, it was found that
the enzyme could not only utilize the long-chain substrates but also
show better affinity to the long-chain substrates than to the short-chain
substrates These results demonstrate that CsyB exhibits a remarkable
ability to synthesize non-natural products and broad specificity for
long-chain fatty acyl SNAC. The application of CsyB in combinatorial
chemistry was realized, which laid a foundation for its industrial
application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Coenzyme A (CoA), fatty
acyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and SNAC were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Acyl diketide-NACs with various lengths were synthesized
according to the published methods.25,26 Oligonucleotides
were obtained from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. The expression
vector pET-CsyB was stored at a −80 °C freezer in our
laboratory.

4.2 Synthesis of the Various Alkyl Diketide-NACs
The synthesis scheme of alkyl diketide-NAC is shown as follows.
Various fatty acids were used to synthesize the alkyl diketide-NACs.
There are two steps in this reaction. First, fatty acid reacted with
Meldrum’s acid at room temperature for 4 h in CH2Cl2 along with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP). After purifying the intermediate, the second step was performed
at 80 °C for 5 h in toluene. Then the targeted compound was isolated
from the final product using silica gel. The eight unnatural alkyl
diketide-NAC substrates were synthesized using the above method.

4.3 Expression and Purification of CsyB
The pET-CsyB/E. coli BLR (DE3) strain
was incubated to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37 °C in an LB
medium containing 50 mg mL–1 kanamycin. The target
protein expression was induced at 20 °C overnight by adding the
isopropyl d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration
of 0.6 mM. The E. coli cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 7000g for 15 min. The cells
were suspended and disrupted by ultrasonication, and the lysate was
centrifuged at 10000g for 30 min. After protein was
purified by metal affinity chromatography, gel filtration chromatography
was used as the last step on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare).
All of the procedures were performed at 4 °C.

4.4 Enzyme Assay and Kinetics Parameters of CsyB
and Mutants
The enzyme assay was performed, and the kinetics
parameters were measured as previously reported.22 Different chain lengths of diketide-NACs and the purified
enzyme were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then the reactions
were initiated by adding the purified enzyme and then further incubated
at 37 °C for 20 min. The decreased amount of substrate was quantified
by HPLC analysis. Steady-state kinetics parameters were determined
from the Lineweaver–Burk plots.
