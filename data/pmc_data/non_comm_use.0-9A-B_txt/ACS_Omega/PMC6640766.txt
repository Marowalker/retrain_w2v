Recently, polycarbonates have attracted
considerable research interest
because of their potential biodegradability and sustainability. Here,
we present a direct route for the synthesis of polycarbonates and
poly(ether carbonate)s from carbon dioxide (CO2) and diols,
promoted by Cs2CO3 and CH2Cl2 under 1 atm of CO2. Quantitative conversion of
diols and polymers with up to 11 kg/mol molecular weight could be
obtained. While benzylic diols lead to predominantly carbonate linkage,
aliphatic diols result in the incorporation of the methylene unit
of CH2Cl2 that produces poly(ether carbonate)s.
Both primary and secondary diols have been successfully incorporated
into the polymer chain.

Introduction
Polymers are important
materials widely used in modern society.
Examples of synthetic polymers include commodity plastics, synthetic
fabrics, rubbers, and so on.1,2 Polymer science has
grown into a major research area in both industry and academia; however,
the nearly exclusive utilization of petroleum-based feedstock for
the synthesis of polymers will ultimately become an issue.3−6 Therefore, development of effective processes for the manufacture
of polymers from renewable resources has attracted significant attention.
One prominent example is the production of polycarbonates from carbon
dioxide (CO2), which is considered an attractive renewable
carbon source because of its low cost, nontoxicity, and availability
in nature and from many industrial processes.7,8 Polycarbonates
represent a class of polymers that is potentially biodegradable and
biocompatible.9 Earlier studies have shown
that aliphatic polycarbonates undergo slow hydrolytic degradation
in vitro and accelerated enzymatic degradation in vivo.10 Some of the polycarbonates have been applied
in the synthesis of engineering thermoplastics and resins and may
be useful as coatings, adhesives, ceramic binders, and packaging materials.11

Typical synthetic pathways for polycarbonates
are summarized in Scheme 1. The classical method
is the condensation of a diol with highly toxic phosgene (COCl2) or its derivatives (route a), by which the conventional
polycarbonate, poly(oxocarbonyloxy-1,4-phenylene isopropylidene-1,4-phenylene),
is produced industrially.12 The alternating
copolymerization of CO2 with epoxides/oxetanes (routes
b and c), in the presence of catalysts/co-catalysts, has been widely
studied.13,14 In particular, homogeneous single-site catalysts
derived from Co, Cr, and Zn are among the most effective ones.15 Similarly, the catalytic ring-opening polymerization
of cyclic carbonates is another promising approach for polycarbonates
(route d).16 However, these routes (b–d)
are restricted more or less by the epoxide/cyclic carbonate monomers
that are available. In comparison, diols provide much greater flexibility
because various structurally diverse diols are readily available for
incorporation. Along this line, condensation/metathesis of diols with
organic dicarbonates such as dimethyl and diphenyl carbonates has
been recently developed (route e).17 However,
dimethyl and diphenyl carbonates still need to be produced from phosgene
or CO2. Thus, a direct approach from CO2 and
diols for the synthesis of polycarbonates would be highly desirable,
but this approach (route f) has been less explored.18

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Polycarbonates
In the context of CO2 utilization, significant
progress
has been made for the direct synthesis of organic carbonate from CO2 and alcohols, in part because CO2 is used directly
and water is the only byproduct.19 One
typical approach involves the three-component coupling of CO2, alcohols, and halides, in the presence of organic or inorganic
base promoters.20 While asymmetric dialkyl
carbonates are produced in general, symmetrical dicarbonates can be
obtained by choosing the appropriate combination of alcohols and halides.
For example, dimethyl carbonate has been synthesized from methanol
and CO2 mediated via inorganic bases and methyl iodide.19a,21 In another approach, direct coupling of CO2 and alcohols
leads to the formation of symmetric dialkyl carbonates, again in the
presence of a base promoter and an appropriate reagent that can serve
as a leaving group.22 We are particularly
drawn to the work of Saito and co-workers, in which various alcohols
were converted to dialkyl carbonates using a combination of Cs2CO3 and dichloromethane (DCM).23 DCM plays an essential role in the transformation, yet
it is not incorporated into the dialkyl carbonate products. Also of
note is that the synthesis was achieved under 1 atm of CO2. Prompted by these advances, we reason that a carbonate linkage
would be generated when a diol is employed under similar conditions,
thus leading to the formation of oligo- and polycarbonates. During
the preparation of this manuscript, a Cs2CO3-promoted synthesis of polycarbonates from CO2, diols,
and dihalides was described.18f In the
present study, we report our efforts that utilize Saito’s method
toward various diols and CO2 in the presence of Cs2CO3 and DCM, yielding polymers with polycarbonate
and poly(ether carbonate) main chains.

Results and Discussion
In our study, 1,4-benzenedimethanol was first chosen as a representative
diol that is unlikely to form cyclic carbonate on account of its rigid
backbone structure. A combination of Cs2CO3/DCM
in a solvent, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), was investigated
as the reagents, as the system has been found to be effective in the
synthesis of organic carbonates from CO2 and alcohols.23 The reaction was initially carried out under
optimized conditions for organic dicarbonates: 1 equiv of 1,4-benzenedimethanol,
4 equiv of Cs2CO3, 6.2 equiv of DCM, and 1 mL
of NMP under 1 atm of CO2 at 100 °C for 12 h (Table 1, entry 1). Excellent
conversion of the diol (>99%), as determined using NMR, was achieved
under these conditions. Not surprisingly, the conversion was reduced
with less loading of Cs2CO3, DCM, or both (entries
2–4). When a polar, aprotic, high-boiling solvent, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), was used as an alternative solvent to NMP, a significant
decrease in the diol conversion was observed under otherwise identical
conditions (entry 5 vs 1). Concerning its role in the synthesis, Cs2CO3 was often considered as a strong base and could
also be used to absorb a small amount of water. Therefore, Cs2CO3 was replaced by a strong organic base, 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene
(DBU), in combination with molecular sieves (entry 6). However, no
conversion of the diol was observed in the reaction, which suggested
that Cs2CO3 served as more than just a base
or dehydrating agent in the reaction. In this context, it was noted
that alkoxides conjugated with cesium ion can exhibit enhanced nucleophilicities
that facilitate the attack on carbon dioxide.24

d The reaction was run in 1 mL of

e The
reaction was run with molecular
sieves of 4 Å and DBU (4 equiv) without Cs2CO3.

The product obtained
in the reaction (entry 1, Table 1) was isolated in decent yields
(63.7%) via precipitation as an off-white solid and characterized
via various spectroscopic techniques including 1H and 13C NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
which suggest the formation of a short-chain polycarbonate with alcohol
end groups. According to a literature study, the carbonate linkage
of the polymer results from the coupling of alcohols and CO2, not from Cs2CO3.20,25 The 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Figures S1 and S2) are comparable with the reported data,18b in which the carbonyl carbon exhibits a characteristic
peak at 156 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum. The presence of
the carbonyl group was also confirmed by the absorbance at 1740 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum, similar to those in other
polycarbonates.26 The ESI-time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrum (Figure S22) features
a main series of peaks at 164n + 138 + 18, which
can be assigned to n(C9H8O3) + 1,4-benzenedimethanol + NH4+. The
molecular weight (Mn) determined by GPC
is 1700 g/mol, with Mw/Mn = 1.2. These observations support the assignment of
a short-chain polycarbonate diol structure. The thermal property of
the isolated product was studied with differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and a melting transition at ∼188 °C was observed
(Figure S23).

Benzylic alcohols tend
to behave quite differently from other aliphatic
alcohols, so we chose a fully aliphatic diol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol,
as the coupling partner with CO2. The reaction was carried
out using 4 equiv of Cs2CO3 and 6.2 equiv of
DCM under 1 atm of CO2 at 100 °C, and the conversion
of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol reached 100% within 12 h, as determined
using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The product has been isolated
as a light colored, soft material with 52.9% yield, and characterization
via NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies revealed some remarkable features
of the polymeric product. The most striking is the resonance at 5.35
ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1) that is assignable to the methylene (a)
protons between two oxygen atoms, suggesting that both carbonate and
ether linkages are present in the polymer backbone. The methylene
group (c) connected to the other side of the carbonate group is represented
by the peaks around 4.0 ppm, and the methylene group (f) connected
to the opposite side of the cyclohexyl linkage was represented by
the peaks around 3.5 ppm. The peaks between 1.0 and 2.0 ppm belong
to the cyclohexane ring. The structure of the polymer was also corroborated
by the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 2), featuring a peak around 155 ppm, assignable
to the carbonate carbon, and a peak around 92 ppm, assignable to the
methylene (a) carbon. These assignments were supported by the 2D COSY
and HSQC NMR spectra of the isolated products (Figures S9 and S10). Furthermore, the existence of the carbonyl
group was confirmed by the absorbance at 1740 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectrum.

from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.

Figure 2 13C NMR spectra of poly(ether carbonate) from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.

On the basis of these analyses,
the structure of the polymeric
product from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and CO2 is characterized
as poly(ether carbonate)s. The ratio of the integration of the set
of peaks at 4.0 ppm (linked to carbonate) to the set of peaks at 3.5
ppm (linked to ether) was 1.07:1, and they were both close to the
integration of the methylene peak at 5.3 ppm. These important observations
suggest that about 93% of the repeating unit of the polymer consists
of an ether–carbonate linkage. The rest was believed to be
the pure carbonate linkage without incorporation of the OCH2O ether moiety, which is consistent with the slightly larger integration
of the set of peaks at 4.0 ppm. The ether–carbonate linkage
was mostly alternating in nature, as suggested by an HMBC NMR experiment
(Figure 3). The observed
three sets of cross peaks clearly demonstrate the connection of C3–C1–C2–C4,
which are interspersed with oxygen atoms. The ether–carbonate
repeating unit of ∼200.1 Da was also detected in the ESI-MS
spectrum (Figure 4),
in agreement with the alternating nature of the structure. Minor incorporation
of the methylene group of CH2Cl2 was observed
in the reaction of CO2 with alcohols for the synthesis
of organic carbonates,24,27 which is believed to result from
the reaction between DCM and alkoxide CsOR or carboxylate CsO(C=O)OR
under the reaction conditions. It is worth mentioning that the formation
of the alternating ether carbonate linkage is quite unique and has
not been observed in other similar systems. In the polycondensation
reaction of CO2 with diols and α,ω-dihalides
promoted by K2CO318a or Cs2CO3,18f the
ether linkage was not detected and both the diol and dihalide units
were incorporated as carbonate linkages.

carbonate) from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.

Figure 4 ESI-TOF-MS of poly(ether carbonate) from 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol.

Another notable observation in
the NMR spectra of the polymer is
that the hydrogen and carbon signals associated with the 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol
moiety are represented by two separate sets of peaks. This is due
to the cis- and trans-isomers of the 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol because
our starting material is a mixture of cis- and trans-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The assignment was verified
by synthesizing polymers from trans-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol
and comparing the respective NMR spectra (Figure S11).

Next, we investigated a variety of diols in direct
copolymerization
with CO2 under similar conditions (Table 2). For most of the diol substrates, high
conversions and decent yields were achieved. The characterization
data of the products, including the NMR and IR spectra, are compiled
in the Supporting Information. As observed
earlier, when another benzylic diol 1,3-benzenedimethanol was used
(entry 4), the resulting polymer consisted of predominantly carbonate
linkage (>95%) with no methylene incorporation; however, regular
aliphatic
diols afforded polymers with alternating polycarbonate/ether repeating
units, as judged by the presence of a singlet around 5.3 ppm assignable
to the methylene group in the 1H NMR. When 1,6-hexanediol,
a linear aliphatic diol that is potentially bio-derived, was employed
in the reaction, diol conversion up to 86% was achieved (Table 2, entry 5). The incorporated
OCH2O unit is identified by the NMR signals at 5.29 ppm
(1H) and 92.6 ppm (13C). However, the isolated
yield (36.0%) of the reaction was somewhat low, probably due to the
formation of short-chain oligomers that were not readily precipitated
out of the mixture during the isolation. Nearly quantitative conversion
was obtained when 1,4-cyclohexanediol was employed as the starting
diol, which indicated that secondary alcohols can be used in this
synthesis (Table 2,
entry 6). The corresponding poly(ether carbonate) was isolated in
good yield (63.1%) with a moderate molecular weight (Mn = 5.1 kg/mol). However, when 1,4-hydroquinone, an aromatic
diol, was used, only a small amount (∼8%) of low-molecular-weight
polymeric material (Mn ∼800 g/mol)
was isolated despite the high conversion of the starting diol (entry
7). Spectroscopic analysis of this isolated product showed the incorporation
of the methylene unit (5.6 ppm in 1H NMR) and the absence
of carbonate linkage (no peak at ∼1740 cm–1 in FT-IR, see Figure S19), and the product
is therefore characterized as an oligomeric −(OCH2OC6H4)n–.
This is consistent with the literature report that the acetal PhOCH2OPh was the predominant product in the reaction of phenol
and CO2 under the Cs2CO3/DCM conditions.23 Obviously, the reaction of phenoxide (ArO–Cs+) with DCM is preferred over the incorporation
of CO2.

As the incorporation
of the OCH2O unit was identified
in the isolated products from all of the aliphatic diols, we thought
it would be interesting to investigate the influence of the loading
of DCM, from 1.6 to 12.3 equiv (vs 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol), on
the outcome of the reactions. Initially, the loadings of DCM did not
seem to affect the ether content, as the resulting products remained
unchanged with an alternating ether–carbonate linkage, as indicated
using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Then, the isolated yields of
polymers (Table 3)
increased with the loadings of DCM (from 1.6 to 9.3 equiv) and the
highest yield (71%) was achieved with 9.3 equiv of DCM. Further increase
in DCM seemed to be not helpful for the isolated yield. GPC analysis
shows that most of the isolated polymers exhibit decent number average
molecular weights (Mn) between 3800 and
7600 g/mol, with a broad polydispersity index from 1.8 to 2.5 (Table 3). We suspect that
a considerable portion of the products are oligomers that are not
readily isolated by the precipitation method. To support this notion,
the methanol-soluble components during precipitation were collected
and analyzed. The 1H NMR spectrum was very similar to that
of the precipitated polymeric products, and GPC analysis showed a Mn of ∼700 g/mol. Furthermore, the combined
yield of the methanol-soluble components and the precipitated polymers
was >90%. In accordance with this notion, the yield of polymers
could
be improved by extending the reaction time (entry 2). With 6.2 equiv
of DCM and 72 h of reaction, we were able to obtain a polymer with
a Mn of 11 kg/mol in 75% isolated yield.

With the excellent reactivity and selectivity achieved
for the
copolymerization of CO2 and diols promoted by the current
Cs2CO3/DCM system, comparison can be made with
the recent procedures reported.18 In the
CeO2/2-cyanopyridine system, carbonate linkage is formed
with >90% selectivity; however, the molecular weights of the obtained
products are low (Mn about 0.5 ∼
1.7 kg/mol) and the procedure works poorly for secondary alcohols.18e In a more closely related Cs2CO3–dihalide system,18f higher
molecular weights up to 43 kg/mol have been achieved. However, it
requires high pressure of CO2 (10 bar, instead of 1 bar
used in this study) and more significantly, the polymers obtained
consist of mostly carbonate linkage incorporating both the diol and
dihalide moieties, same as in the K2CO3-promoted
reactions,18a but distinctly different
from the results presented here. Similar polymers with mostly carbonate
linkages incorporating both the diol and dihalide moieties have been
obtained in our preliminary study of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol with
a high pressure of CO2 (40 bar), even though the molecular
weights remained relatively low (Mn ∼3.0
kg/mol). It thus appears that the pressure of CO2 plays
a significant role in determining the polymer linkage and is likely
responsible for the difference observed. The low molecular weights
obtained so far in this study are generally insufficient to meet the
requirement of industrial plastics and may indicate low CO2 fixation. Efforts have been made to improve the chain length of
the products, and polymers with Mn up
to 11 kg/mol were obtained by extending the reaction time (entry 6, Table 3).

On the basis
of these results and the related studies in the literature,24,25 a possible, simplified pathway is proposed in Scheme 2. The nucleophilic attack on CO2 by the alkoxide generated from deprotonation of diol by Cs2CO3 results in the formation of a carboxylate, which reacts
with DCM to yield an intermediate A, again aided by Cs2CO3, although it is not entirely clear why so large
an amount of Cs2CO3 is needed (see Table 1, entries 2 and 4).
The preference of methylene incorporation into aliphatic diols over
benzylic diols might stem from the difference in their acidity (pKa ∼14.0 for benzylic diols and ∼14.8–14.9
for aliphatic diols in this study). Whereas the attack at the carbonate
position a by the less basic benzylic alkoxide leads
to pure polycarbonate, the more basic aliphatic alkoxide seems to
prefer to attack at the methylene position b, affording
methylene-incorporated poly(ether carbonate).

for the Copolymerization of the Diols and CO2
Conclusions
In
summary, a new procedure for the direct synthesis of polycarbonates
and poly(ether carbonate)s from diols and CO2 has been
reported under 1 atm pressure of CO2 using a combination
of Cs2CO3 and CH2Cl2 as
the reagent. Excellent conversions and isolated yields are achieved
with various diols including benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. Both
primary and secondary aliphatic diols have proven to be suitable substrates
for the copolymerization. The isolated polymers have been fully investigated
by IR, NMR, GPC, and ESI-MS, which confirmed the structure of the
products. Notably, the polycarbonates from benzylic diols contain
more than 90% of the carbonate linkage, whereas the polymers from
aliphatic diols contain mainly the alternating carbonate/ether linkage.
In addition, attempts at expanding the substrate scope and controlling
the type of the linkage formed in the reaction are now underway in
our laboratory.

Experimental Section
Materials
Organic
compounds including all diols are
commercially available and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The
diols were dried under vacuum overnight. DCM was dried over activated
molecular sieves (4 Å) overnight. The predried Cs2CO3 and NMP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further purification. All of the compounds were stored inside
a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere.

General Methods
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVANCE-500 NMR spectrometer (1H and 13C). GPC
analysis was performed on a Varian Prostar, using a PLgel 5 μm
Mixed-D column, a Prostar 355 RI detector, and tetrahydrofuran as
the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (20 °C). Polystyrene standards
were used for calibration. The HR-MS (ESI-TOF) was performed on a
high-resolution time of flight G1969A instrumentation (Agilent) using
2.5 mM ammonium acetate as an ionizing agent. The DSC data were collected
on a PerkinElmer Pyris DSC using 10.0 °C/min heating rate with
20 mL/min nitrogen flow. The FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 400 FT-IR spectrophotometer.

Typical Procedure for Polymerization
A 100 mL Schlenk
flask was dried by heating under vacuum and then transferred into
a dry nitrogen glove box, where it was loaded with 1 mmol of a diol,
4 mmol of Cs2CO3, 6.2 mmol of DCM, and 1 mL
of NMP. The flask was then taken out of the glove box, the reaction
mixture was frozen using liquid N2, and the N2 atmosphere was replaced by dry CO2 with three evacuation–refill
cycles. The reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C for 12 h with
stirring. The conversion was checked by 1H NMR of the crude
mixture. The isolation procedure of the polymeric products depended
on the substrates. For benzylic diols, the reaction mixture was first
treated with water (10 mL), and the insoluble solid was collected
by filtration or centrifugation and washed with methanol (2 mL) thrice.
For aliphatic diols, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed
with DCM (5 mL) thrice. The filtrate was collected and concentrated
to ∼1 mL under vacuum. Methanol (5 mL) was then added, and
the precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation and washed
further with methanol (1 mL × 3). Finally, the solid product
was dried under vacuum to a constant weight to determine the yield.
