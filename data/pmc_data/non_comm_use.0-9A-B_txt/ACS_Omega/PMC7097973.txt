Neurodegenerative
diseases represent some of the greatest challenges
for both basic science and clinical medicine. Due to their prevalence
and the lack of known biochemical-based treatments, these complex
pathologies result in an increasing societal cost. Increasing genetic
and neuropathological evidence indicates that lysosomal impairment
may be a common factor linking these diseases, demanding the development
of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring the lysosomal function.
Here, we propose the design and synthesis of a nucleolipid conjugate
as a nonviral chemical nanovector to specifically target neuronal
cells and intracellular organelles. Herein, thymidine, appropriately
substituted to increase its lipophilicity, was used as a model nucleoside
and a fluorophore moiety, covalently bound to the nucleoside, allowed
the monitoring of nucleolipid internalization in vitro. To improve
nucleolipid protection and cellular uptake, these conjugates were
formulated in nanoemulsions. In vitro biological assays demonstrated
cell uptake- and internalization-associated colocalization with lysosomal
markers. Overall, this nucleolipid–nanoemulsion-based formulation
represents a promising drug-delivery tool to target the central nervous
system, able to deliver drugs to restore the impaired lysosomal function.

Introduction
The selective filter
of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is
one of the major obstacles to the achievement of efficient drug delivery1,2 and therapeutic effect to the brain,3,4 which hampers
further treatments for brain-related diseases. Nowadays, innovation
in the field of nanosystems allows a better crossing of biological
membranes, thus paving the way for new therapeutic approaches.1,3,5 Nucleolipids (NLs) are bifunctional
hybrid molecules in which a lipid moiety and a nucleic acid moiety
(nucleoside, nucleotide, nucleobase, or oligonucleotide) are covalently
linked.6 Exhibiting a wide structural variety,
these molecules can be natural such as algelasine F and tunicamycin7,8 or of synthetic origin like the DOTAU.9 NLs, either natural or synthetic, are interesting not only for their
potential biological activities, including antimicrobial, antifungal,
antiviral, and antitumor properties,10−12 but also for their remarkable
ability to self-assemble. Indeed, amphiphilic molecules, such as the
DOTAU, can form supramolecular objects like micelles or liposomes,
which can be used to deliver DNA, antisense oligonucleotides, or siRNA
directly into the cells.9 Because of their
similarity to the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, these molecules
are expected to cross the plasma membrane without the need for membrane
transporters. Considering the benefit of nanoemulsions (NEs) as vehicles
for therapeutic agents to target the brain,13−15 their combination
with NLs, as a potential absorption promoter, seemed to be a tantalizing
approach to improve the passage of the BBB.

Oil-in-water (O/W)
NEs, made of submicrometric oily droplets stabilized
by a corona of amphiphilic surfactants, present enhanced stability
compared to other nanosystems and high loading capacity of hydrophobic
drugs or imaging probes.13,16−18 Very recently it has also been reported that some NLs, such as an
NL radiotracer, were successfully able to permeate the BBB,19 suggesting that NLs could be promising absorption
promoters. In this work, original NEs associated with nucleolipids
were developed to enhance the membrane-crossing properties for therapeutic
purposes and particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.
Indeed, previous studies have shown that both nanoparticles and NEs
loaded with an acidic cargo made of poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were able to induce neuroprotective
effects, and following a systemic injection, NEs were able to cross
the BBB.20,21

Herein, we report the design and synthesis
of original NLs and
their formulation into NEs to cross the plasma membrane. We show the
contributing role of NEs in the uptake and internalization of NLs
into neuronal cells in vitro, and colocalization of NLs with lysosome
was observed. These results suggest that lysosomes can be efficiently
targeted by the use of these nanotechnology-based systems for drug
delivery to treat brain diseases, in particular, neurodegenerative
diseases, where lysosomal impairment occurs, among others.22,23

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of Nucleolipidic Platforms
Six
compounds, of which three were original NLs (Figure 1A), were then designed, synthesized, and
biologically evaluated. Commercially available thymidine was used
as a nucleosidic platform, and key positions were conveniently functionalized
step-by-step (Figure 1B). A benzyl group was introduced at the N-3 position of thymidine
to enhance the lipophilicity of the compound and allow solubilization
in the oily phase to provide an NE formulation later on. The first
NL, compound A, was substituted with a palmitic chain
at the 5′ position and a rhodamine B fluoroprobe at position
3′. In NL compound B, the lipid chain and rhodamine
B positions were switched. Thereby, these two lipophilic NLs were
formulated into NEs, to carry out in vitro biological assays and evaluate
the role of NLs, as well as the positions of the different substituents
and their influence on the uptake into cells. The third NL (compound C) has been similarly designed by removing the benzyl group
to make it water-soluble and investigate the role of NE itself. The
last three compounds were used as a control. Compound D was rhodamine B, one formulated in an NE and solubilized in water,
to determine the role of the NEs, and compound E was
a rhodamine–lipid conjugate (Figure 1B). Compound E was designed
to compare its internalization into neuronal cells with that of compound A and investigate the benefits of using an NL rather than
a simple lipid chain.

of
the different compounds synthetized for this study. (C) Synthetic
sequence leading to NL-A.

Nucleolipids A and B were prepared in
seven- and five-step sequences, respectively. The first step was selective
protection of the nucleoside to functionalize, thereafter, either
position 3′ or 5′. A benzyl group was added on the thymidine
N-3 position by a simple alkylation following a procedure, using microwave
activation, previously developed in the laboratory.24 An esterification reaction between palmitic acid and thymidine
was performed at the free hydroxyl positions (position 5′ for
compound A and position 3′ for compound B). The protective group was then cleaved before a subsequent
esterification step with the rhodamine B moiety (Figure 1C). Compound C was obtained through a six-step sequence, while compound E required a unique esterification step.

Nanoemulsion Preparation
and Characterization
The lipidic
nature and plasticity of O/W NEs make them suitable intravenous (iv)
systems for drug delivery. NEs exhibit good encapsulation ability
for hydrophobic drugs and efficiently improve their stability, IV
tolerance, and bioavailability.25 Five
nanoemulsions were formulated with medium chain triglyceride oil Miglyol
812N as the oily phase and two surfactants polysorbate 80 (Tween 80)
and egg phospholipids (Lecithin E80) (Table 1). NE-A, NE-B, NE-D, and NE-E were loaded, respectively, with
nucleolipids A and B, rhodamine (D), and the rhodamine–lipid conjugate (E). An
unloaded NE named NE-O was used as a control.

Physicochemical analysis of the formulations by dynamic
light scattering
(DLS) showed that all five formulations had a submicrometric size
range (Table 2). All
formulations displayed a monodispersed distribution with a dispersity
below 0.2. Zetameter measurements showed a negative ζ-potential
for the control formulation (NE-O). Indeed, this negative
charge is linked with the lecithin E80 surfactant (a mixture of phospholipids
including negatively charged phospholipids). Interestingly, NE-A and NE-B were found to exhibit a positive
ζ-potential. The same phenomenon was observed for NE-E, the rhodamine–lipid-based NE, which is also naturally positively
charged. Contrariwise, a negative ζ-potential was found with
the rhodamine B-based formulation (NE-D) because non-lipid-conjugated
rhodamine was solubilized in the oil phase at a final concentration
of 25 mg/mL, suggesting that in this case, rhodamine B was placed
inside the oily droplet and not at its surface (Figure 2).

and loaded NEs. (A)

Finally,
the colloidal stability of three of these NEs was monitored
in dynamic light scattering (DLS) to assess the size of the globules
and the index of polydispersity.26 Moreover,
the ζ-potential was measured using a zetameter (Figure 2B). Satisfactorily, all formulations
proved to remain monodispersed with a mean diameter under 200 nm for
at least 14 days, and their ζ-potential was consistent over
the same time. Moreover, NE-A, NE-D, and NE-E when assessed for longer times were found to be stable
over 30 days.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Nucleolipid-Loaded
Nanoemulsions
Six formulations have been used in vitro to
evaluate their respective
cytotoxicity on human neuroblastoma cell lines (BE (2)-M17 cells)
for either 24 or 48 h. These are the four NEs prepared (NE-A, NE-B, NE-D, and NE-E) and
two aqueous formulations of compounds C and D (C: NL without the benzyl group and D:
rhodamine B). After 24 or 48 h of exposure, no significant toxicity
was observed, except for formulations Aq-D and NE-E (in the range of 20–36%) (Figure 3).

cells treated with NE-A, NE-B, NE-D, and NE-E and compounds C and D solubilized in water
compared to the control condition (UT) after 24 and 48 h. *p < 0.05 compared with untreated cells.

Role of NL-Loaded NEs for Internalization into Lysosomes in
Vitro
As previously mentioned, lysosomal impairment is a
common factor in neurodegenerative diseases. Lysosomes are intracellular
acidic compartments that contain hydrolytic enzymes involved in the
degradation of intracellular components through several degradation
pathways, including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy.26,27 Therefore, to determine if these NE–NL nanovectors can be
used as a drug-delivery system for neuronal cells, cellular uptake
and lysosomal colocalization of the different compounds, labeled with
rhodamine B, were investigated (Figure 4). Foremost, it has been observed that compounds/formulations NE-A, NE-B, NE-E, and Aq-C were well internalized into cells, while only 12 and 6% cellular
uptake was observed for formulations NE-D and Aq-D, respectively. One possible explanation regarding the low rate of
internalization of NE-D and Aq-D might be
the leakage of free rhodamine outside the oily droplet of the NE,
preventing the NE from fully serving its carrier function. Nevertheless,
an uptake of 100% was obtained for the two NLs and the rhodamine–lipid
conjugate loaded into NEs (A, B, or E), and it was found that the rate of NL internalized into
cells was greatly enhanced with the use of NE. Indeed, we observed
that only 50% of Aq-C, solubilized in water, get through
plasma membranes (Figures 4 and 5). Furthermore, each of these
compounds labeled with rhodamine (red) colocalized into lysosomes
(LAMP2, green).

Consequently, the combination of nanoemulsions with properly
substituted
nucleolipids A and B provided efficient
and nontoxic nanovectors for neuronal cells’ internalization
and subsequent lysosome colocalization.

Conclusions
We
proposed the synthesis of original thymidine-derived NLs bearing
the fluorophore rhodamine B to study their biocompatibility and their
role as a promoter of absorption to cross biological membranes. First,
we designed lipophilic NLs to afford solubilization into the oily
phase of O/W NE. Then, the lipidic chains on the sugar moiety and
the benzyl group were substituted on the thymine amino group, allowing
the formulation of NLs into NEs. The colloidal stability of this NL–NE
system was monitored over time by DLS and ζ-potential analysis
before carrying out in vitro experiments. Cytotoxicity evaluation
of NL–NE complexes on human neuronal cells showed that NLs
are fully biocompatible after 24 and 48 h of exposure, while other
amphiphilic compounds, such as rhodamine–lipid conjugates,
display cellular toxicity. Evaluations of uptake into cells indicate
that NL–NE systems are successfully internalized, highlighting
the contribution of NEs as drug-delivery vehicles. More importantly,
these original NLs bearing a fluorophore moiety are colocalized with
lysosomes, suggesting that these nanotechnology-based systems can
also be efficient tools to target lysosomes, whose impairment has
been involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, these results
were promising and pave the way to test, in future studies, and improve
these new NL–NE systems for drug delivery in vivo, offering
the possibilities for specific therapeutic solutions targeting pathologies
associated with lysosomal impairment.

argon are sequentially added tert-butyldimethylsilyl
chloride (TBDMSCl) (1.2 equiv, 4.48 g, 29.72 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP) (spatula tip). The mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature

Synthesis of Compound 5
To a solution
of 4 (1 equiv, 0.326 g, 4.03 × 10–1 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (4.54 mL) and under argon is added
tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (1 M in THF,
0.403 mL) at 0 °C. The mixture is stirred for 2 h at 0 °C.
The reaction is then quenched by the addition of water (5 mL), and
the mixture is warmed to room temperature before the addition of DCM
(10 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted three times with DCM (3 ×
10 mL), and the combined organic phases are dried over Na2SO4 before concentration to dryness under vacuum. The
resulting crude is purified by flash chromatography on a silica gel
(pentane/AcOEt, gradient 90/10 to 70/30) to obtain the expected compound 5 (0.190 g, 3.33 × 10–1 mmol, 83%). Rf: 0.31 (pentane/EtOAc, 92/8). 1H

Synthesis of Compound A
To a solution
of 5 (1 equiv, 0.190 g, 3.33 × 10–1 mmol) in DCM (1.9 mL) and under argon are sequentially added rhodamine
B (1.2 equiv, 0.191 g, 3.99 × 10–1 mmol), EDC·HCl
(1 equiv, 0.062 g, 3.23 × 10–1 mmol), and DMAP
(0.3 equiv, 0.012 g, 9.99 × 10–2 mmol) were
sequentially added. The mixture is stirred for 48 h at room temperature.
The reaction is then quenched by the addition of NH4Cl
(5 mL, aq.) and diluted with water (10 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted
three times with DCM (3 × 10 mL), and the combined organic phases
are dried over Na2SO4 before concentration to
dryness under vacuum. The resulting crude is purified by flash chromatography
on a silica gel (DCM/MeOH, 95/5) to obtain the expected compound A as a purple powder (0.132 g, 1.28 × 10–1 mmol, 40%). Rf: 0.24 (DCM/MeOH, 95/5). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 8.24–8.34

General Procedure for NE
Preparation
Lipoid E80 (Lipoid
GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany) was dispersed in heated (i.e., 70 °C)
oil phase Miglyol 812N (IOI Oleo GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) using ultrasound
delivered by a sonication bath. Once the dispersion was complete,
1 × 10–5 mol of the compound (A, B, D, or F) was solubilized
in oil and surfactant mixture. Hydrophilic surfactant Tween 80 (SEPPIC,
Paris, France) was dispersed in the heated (i.e., 70°) water
phase (Milli-Q water). Emulsification was observed on adding the water
phase to the oil phase thanks to the phase-inversion method. Homogenization
was performed using a sonication probe (Sonic Vibra Cell-VC 250) for
10 min to obtain submicron size range oil droplets. Prior to in vitro
experiments, formulation osmolality was adjusted with the addition
of glycerol (Coopération pharmaceutique française) at
2% and pH was adjusted close to the physiological value using sodium
hydroxide 0.1 N.

NE Characterization and Stability
Granulometric profiles
of NE were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using Malvern
Instruments (Zetasizer Nano ZS). NEs were diluted 1:1000 (v/v), and
the average size and the polydispersity index were determined by three
independent measurements performed at 25 °C. To analyze the ζ-potential,
NEs were diluted 1:1000 (v/v) and measurements were performed using
Zetasizer Nano ZS coupled with a folded capillary cell (DTS1060) from
Malvern Instruments. Short-term stability assessment of the NE was
performed for 1 month by checking the lack of visual creaming or phase
separation and by checking the granulometric profiles and ζ-potential.

Cell Culture and Cell Viability Assay
Cell lines BE
(2)-M17 (human neuroblastoma) were obtained from ATCC (CRL-2267) and
grown in OPTIMEM (Life Technologies, 31985-047) by adding 10% fetal
bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For all
experiments, freshly prepared NE solutions were used and cells were
grown at 70–80% confluence. Cells were treated for 24 or 48
h with 0.5 μL of loaded NE. Each experiment was reproduced at
least three times. Cell viability was estimated by the MTS assay (ATCC/LGC
Promochem) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunostaining
and Imaging
For all experiments, NE
solutions were freshly prepared. For loaded-NE internalization and
colocalization imaging assays, cells were trypsinized and replated
in 6-well plates (NUNC) with coverslips. BE (2)-M17 cells were grown
at 70–80% confluence per well. Once cells were attached, they
were exposed for 24 h at 37 °C to the different loaded nanoemulsions.
All nanoemulsions were added at a final concentration of ∼50
μg/mL. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
min at 4 °C and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Cell permeabilization and blocking steps were realized by the addition
of a mixture composed of 5 mL of PBS, 450 μL of normal goat
serum, and 225 μL of triton. Lysosomes were marked with the
LAMP2 (Mx, H4B4) antibody overnight at 4 °C, and staining was
revealed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with GAM
488 (Life Technologies). For cytoplasm and nucleus staining, the cells
were incubated for 8 min at room temperature with 8 μM Hoechst
dye (ThermoFisher Scientific, #3342) prior to mounting. Slices were
air-dried and mounted on #1.5 coverslips with Dako fluorescent mounting
medium and left to dry overnight in darkness.

Image stacks (pixel
size ∼100 nm, z-step 0.3 μm) were acquired
on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8 microscope,
Leica Microsystems) using a 63X Plan Apo CS oil immersion objective.
Rhodamine B was detected using an excitation wavelength of 568 nm
(DPSS laser) and with a detection window between 570 and 590 nm. Lysosomes
were detected using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (argon laser)
and with a detection window between 545 and 605 nm. Cells without
loaded-nanoemulsion treatments were used in parallel as autofluorescence
controls using the corresponding excitation and detection wavelengths.
Images were analyzed with LAS AF v2.6 acquisition software equipped
with an HCS-A module (Leica Microsystems). Rhodamine B intensity relative
to the cell surface was quantified with Definiens XD Developer v2.5
software (Definiens). Colocalization, fluorescence profiles, orthogonal
projections, and maximal intensity projections were obtained with
the ImageJ (NIH) distribution Fiji.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
in GraphPad Prism 6 software. For functional assays, statistical significance
of the data was evaluated after one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. The level of
significance was set at p < 0.05.
