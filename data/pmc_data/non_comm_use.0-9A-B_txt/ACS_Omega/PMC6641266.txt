Atomic layer deposition
(ALD) of the well-known Al2O3 on a LiCoO2 system is compared with that of a
newly developed AlWxFy material. ALD coatings (∼1 nm thick) of both materials
are shown to be effective in improving cycle life through mitigation
of surface-induced capacity losses. However, the behaviors of Al2O3 and AlWxFy are shown to be significantly different when coated
directly on cathode particles versus deposition on a composite electrode
composed of active materials, carbons, and binders. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic intermittent titration techniques,
and four-point measurements suggest that electron transport is more
limited in LiCoO2 particles coated with Al2O3 compared with that in particles coated with AlWxFy. The results show
that proper design/choice of coating materials (e.g., AlWxFy) can improve capacity
retention without sacrificing electron transport and suggest new avenues
for engineering electrode–electrolyte interfaces to enable
high-voltage operation of lithium-ion batteries.

Introduction
To meet the ever-increasing
demands placed on lithium-ion batteries
for both transportation applications and portable electronics, higher
energy lithium-ion batteries with longer calendar life, lower cost,
and greater safety are under development. An obvious strategy for
obtaining higher energies is to operate batteries at higher voltages,
thus extracting more energy per charge from the system. However, battery
lifetimes under high-voltage operation (typically ≳4.2 V vs
graphite) are short-lived owing to deleterious side reactions between
charged electrodes and organic electrolytes.1−3 Coating the
surface of electrodes in an effort to mitigate unfavorable side reactions
has proved to be a promising route for improving various performance
metrics of lithium-ion batteries.4−6 Several coating techniques
and processes, including physical mixing, wet-chemical routes (sol–gel),
and physical/chemical vapor deposition (PVD/CVD), are, among others,
available to modify electrode surfaces. Atomic layer deposition (ALD),
a modified CVD process, has been used extensively to enhance the stability
and safety of positive and negative electrodes.7−10 ALD is versatile compared with
traditional coating methods, in that protection layers can be deposited
not only on electrode material powders but also directly on electrode
laminates that are composed of active materials, carbons, and polymeric
binders. This unique capability, combined with the self-limiting nature
of ALD surface chemistry, makes ALD attractive compared with conventional
wet-chemical processes. Furthermore, ALD does not require postheating
treatments as do wet-chemical methods.

Previous reports of ALD-coated
laminates and powders have shown
both routes to be effective in improving the durability and performance
of lithium-ion cells.7,8,11,12 Coating directly on active materials, in
general, allows scale-up (gram to kilograms) and easy implementation
into current battery manufacturing processes.13 In addition, processing of active materials can be extended to various
coating materials that require high deposition temperatures (>250–300
°C) such as some fluorides and sulfides because the crystallinity
and morphologies of active materials are not affected by the typical
temperatures used. On the contrary, ALD processing of electrodes inherently
limits the choice to lower temperature coating materials (<150–200
°C) to prevent the decomposition of polymeric binders in the
laminates during the ALD process. ALD processes that require substrate
temperatures significantly higher than the melting temperature of
binders (∼160–180 °C) cannot be used for laminate
coating. In addition, new ALD strategies, for example, roll-to-roll
or spatial ALD, need to be developed for compatibility with current
battery manufacturing processes.14,15

Although
metal oxides such as Al2O3, ZrO2,
and TiO2 have received the most attention in
ALD protective coating studies, these materials are electrical insulators
so that directly coating the particles may hinder charge transport
(ionic and electronic) between particles. On the other hand, ALD coatings
directly on electrode laminates should not affect particle-to-particle
transport because diffusion paths for charge transport are established
in the laminate-making process, prior to the ALD coating. In addition,
coating laminates may also provide some level of protection for the
inactive components, such as polymeric binders and carbons, which
are susceptible to reaction with electrolytes. Nevertheless, as mentioned
above, direct coating of electrodes limits the choice of coating materials
owing to the lower temperature requirements.

With these considerations
in mind, it is clear that the electrochemical
properties of ALD-coated electrodes can be influenced by the choice
of fabrication process and coating material. However, few comparisons
between the two processes and the details involved exist with notable
exceptions being works by Jung et al.7 Therein,
the authors reported that the ALD of Al2O3 coating
on LiCoO2 particles and electrodes did not show appreciable
differences in terms of discharge capacities.7 Al2O3 coatings on graphite anode laminates
were reported to have superior electrochemical properties compared
to Al2O3 coatings directly on the graphite powder.10 However, detailed electrochemical properties
including voltage profiles, rate capabilities, and transport properties
of electrons/ions were not reported.

To further understand the
ALD process with respect to electrode
versus particle coating and choice of materials, we report herein
the effects of ALD coatings on powders versus laminates. We choose
as a baseline the well-known Al2O3 on a LiCoO2 system and compare with a newly developed AlWxFy material. Despite
being ultrathin (∼1 nm), and regardless of the ALD process
and a coating material, we find that the electrochemical performance
of LiCoO2 is dramatically improved. However, owing to the
more insulating nature of Al2O3, coated LiCoO2 particles showed a large overpotential during lithium insertion,
whereas AlWxFy-coated particles did not. This result reveals the importance of
charge-transport considerations through coating layers when designing
effective coating materials.

Experimental Section
Atomic Layer Deposition
Al2O3 layers were deposited using trimethylaluminum
(TMA, Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) and H2O, and AlWxFy layers were deposited using TMA and tungsten
hexafluoride (WF6, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Substrate (electrode
laminates) temperatures were kept at 150 and 200 °C for Al2O3 and AlWxFy, respectively. For ALD coating on particles, LiCoO2 powder (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was loaded into a customized
stainless steel sample tray covered with a mesh to allow facile precursor
diffusion and to keep the powders in the holder. Eight cycles of TMA–N2–H2O–N2 or four cycles
of TMA–N2–WF6–N2 were used to deposit 1 nm coatings of Al2O3 or AlWxFy, respectively, on the powders or the laminates. Detailed procedures
can be found in the previous reports.11,12

Electrochemical
Measurements
The LiCoO2 composite
electrodes were prepared by mixing a slurry of the oxide (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA), Super P, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), followed by casting
on aluminum foil and drying under vacuum at 110 °C overnight.
The oxide/Super P/PVDF mass ratios were 84:8:8 in the Li metal half-cell
studies. The 2032-type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox
(water and oxygen ≤0.5 ppm) with Gen2 electrolyte (1.2 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and ethyl–methyl
carbonate with a mass ratio
of 3:7). Charge–discharge measurements were recorded on a MACCOR
cycler at room temperature under different rates with various upper
cutoff voltages ranging from 4.4 to 4.6 V (vs Li metal). The galvanostatic
intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements for powder-coated
LiCoO2 electrodes and uncoated LiCoO2 electrodes
were conducted between voltage windows of 2.5–4.4 V. Prior
to the GITT measurements, a formation cycle at 20 mA/g between 2.5
and 4.4 V was conducted on each cell. The GITT protocol consisted
of 10 mA/g current pulses for 10 min, followed by 300 min relaxation
periods for voltage windows in the charge and discharge direction.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed by the Evans Analytical Group
(Sunnyvale, CA) on the thick films of Al2O3 and
AlWxFy, deposited
on silicon wafers. Cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared using
the in situ focused ion beam (FIB) liftout technique on an FEI Strata
DualBeam FIB/scanning electron microscope. The samples were capped
with a protective layer of carbon prior to FIB milling and were imaged
with an FEI Tecnai TF-20 FEG/TEM operated at 200 kV.

Results
and Discussion
LiCoO2 powders and electrode laminates
were coated with
films of Al2O3 and AlWxFy. Film thicknesses were limited
to ∼1 nm to mitigate thickness effects of coating materials.7 All coated LiCoO2 particles and electrodes
showed excellent capacity retention compared to uncoated LiCoO2 when cycled above 4.4 V, as expected, whereas significant
impedance growth was observed for uncoated samples as depicted in Figure S1. Table 1 summarizes the discharge capacities measured during
the 1st, 2nd, and 50th cycles at the different upper cutoff voltages
tested for LiCoO2 powders and laminates, bare and coated
with Al2O3 and AlWxFy. The discharge capacities of all coated
samples were similar. However, the voltage profiles were different
between the powder and laminate coatings. Figure 1a,b shows charge–discharge voltage
profiles for the coated LiCoO2 powders (straight lines)
and laminates (dotted lines) on the 2nd cycle. For all of the samples,
the main LiCoO2 electrochemical features are observable;
for example, a long plateau at ∼3.9 V and transition peaks
at ∼4.1 V (∼120–140 mA h/g). The typical sharp
knee in the discharge at ∼3.8 V remains strong for all but
the Al2O3-coated particles (Figure 1a), and we attribute this to
the development of a strong overpotential on discharge for this sample.
As such, reinsertion of lithium ions into the host structures is impeded
and thus requires more energy. Such behavior may be resulted from
the insulating nature of the coating that imposes kinetic barriers
for electron and lithium-ion transport. It is noteworthy that the
overpotential during lithium insertion (discharge) is higher than
that during lithium extraction (charge). It is not clear why lithium
insertion is more difficult than extraction with coating layers, but
this could relate to the formation of Li2MO2-like phases on the oxide particle surface owing to sluggish lithium-ion
diffusion through the coating material.16 The laminate coatings, however, showed only small overpotentials.
We attribute these smaller overpotentials to the fact that the electronic
and ionic pathways between the active materials, carbon, and current
collector within the composite electrode are maintained after the
ALD laminate coating, in agreement with earlier reports.10 It is interesting to note that AlWxFy-coated LiCoO2 showed little difference between the particle and laminate coatings
compared to Al2O3 coatings. Although small overpotentials
were observed for the AlWxFy coatings, they were significantly less pronounced
than, for example, Al2O3-coated LiCoO2 particles. We speculate that the much higher electronic conductivity
of AlWxFy reduces
the overpotential compared with the electronically insulating Al2O3 coatings.12

Figure 1c,d shows
cycling stabilities of particle- and laminate-coated LiCoO2 (Al2O3 and AlWxFy) cycled to upper cutoff voltages of
4.4 and 4.5 V along with uncoated LiCoO2. At voltages ≥4.4
V (vs Li/Li+), LiCoO2 is known to destabilize.17 In particular, surface damage (e.g., oxygen
loss and transition metal migration) may lead to slow phase transformation
and progressive capacity fade. Therefore, 4.4 and 4.5 V were chosen
for long-term cycling studies to judge the relative efficacy of coated
materials for protecting LiCoO2 surfaces. All of the coated
samples exhibited stable electrochemical performance compared to the
uncoated samples (see Figure S1). Capacity
differences between the powder and laminate coatings were small at
both 4.4 and 4.5 V, except for the case of Al2O3 at 4.5 V. At 4.5 V, the Al2O3-coated laminates
achieved ∼15 mA h/g more than the Al2O3-coated particles, likely because of the high impedance associated
with coated particles as discussed above (see also Supporting Figures). However, the higher capacity of the coated
laminate sample could not be maintained with cycling and possibly
signals a more rapid breakdown of the Al2O3 film
at this high voltage (4.5 V). By contrast, the AlWxFy coatings, on both powders and
laminates, exhibited consistent capacities at both 4.4 and 4.5 V.
It is also expected that the coatings provide superior rate capabilities
than uncoated LiCoO2 owing to the absence of electrolyte
oxidative products during high voltage of operation as reported earlier.12 In addition, the capacity achieved at 4.5 V
for the AlWxFy-coated laminates was similar to the capacity of the Al2O3-coated laminate at 4.5 V; however, this capacity could
be maintained with cycling for the AlWxFy material with little change in the
voltage profile. These data reveal the superior performance of the
AlWxFy coatings
on particles and laminates compared with that of Al2O3 coatings.

Coated (Al2O3 and AlWxFy) and uncoated
LiCoO2 electrodes were characterized using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) and GITT with current pulses (10 mA/g for 10 min) as reported
earlier.18Figure 2a shows charge–discharge voltage profiles
of all samples prior to EIS and GITT measurements. As expected, the
Al2O3-coated LiCoO2 powder sample
has a large overpotential, whereas the uncoated LiCoO2 has
only a small overpotential when cycled at a slow current rate of 20
mA/g. GITT results (Figure 2b) for LixCoO2, with
0.35 < x < 0.55, corresponding to capacities
of 100–150 mA h/g, show that lithium diffusion is slower in
the coated materials, and little difference exists between the equilibrium
potentials for the coated samples. Therefore, lithium transport across
the ionically insulating Al2O3 and AlWxFy coatings is similar. Figure 3a shows representative
Nyquist spectra of an AlWxFy-coated LiCoO2/Li half-cell between 10
kHz and 0.1 Hz with a 5 mV voltage perturbation. As expected, the
spectrum consists of a high-frequency intersect (electrolyte impedance),
mid-frequency (1k–10 Hz) semicircle corresponding to charge-transfer
impedance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, and a low-frequency
(<1 Hz) Warburg tail.19,20 The Al2O3- and AlWxFy-coated sample curves began to deviate at ∼3.9 V when
cycled at 20 mA/g, where EIS spectra at four different voltages starting
at 3.8 V are shown in Figure 3b. The semicircle at high to mid frequencies at different
discharge voltages, or depth of discharge (DOD), did not change significantly
within and between samples, implying that the surface films at the
electrode–electrolyte interface are stable at the given condition.
The low-frequency tail below 1 Hz became straighter at low voltages
because of low lithium diffusivity at low states of charge. Interestingly,
magnitudes of impedance (normalized by mass) at the same potential,
or the same DOD, are smaller for AlWxFy than for the Al2O3 coatings. For example, magnitudes of the impedance at 3.5 V and
0.1 Hz were found to be 3.08 and 3.40 Ω·g, whereas those
at 90% DOD were found to be 2.87 and 3.40 Ω·g for AlWxFy and Al2O3, respectively. Because lithium-ion diffusion
characteristics of the two coated materials were similar from GITT,
the differences in EIS and overpotentials may be attributed to the
differences in electronic transport.

Figure 4a
shows
a cross-sectional bright-field TEM image of an Al2O3–AlWxFy bilayer deposited on Si. The homogeneous, bright color of
the Al2O3 layer suggests an amorphous, uniform
material composed of light elements with low electron densities. The
dark and light contrast of the AlWxFy layer, along with previous studies, suggests
that AlWxFy coatings consist of small, W-containing particles embedded in a
matrix of lower density material such as AlF3 when deposited
under these conditions. A similar microstructure was measured for
ALD AlMoxFy films deposited under similar conditions.21 In addition, previous X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies on
thick ALD AlWxFy films confirmed the metallic nature of tungsten or tungsten
carbide, and resistivity values from four-point measurement on the
film were found to be 10–2 Ω·cm, approximately
18 orders of magnitude smaller than that of Al2O3.22 However, preliminary X-ray absorption
spectroscopy data on AlWxFy-coated particles (not shown) suggest the presence
of partially oxidized Wδ+ species. Therefore, it
is likely that strong interactions between thin (∼1 nm) AlWxFy films and
the underlying oxide particle substrate (e.g., LiCoO2)
play an important and unique role in AlWxFy-coated, lithium–metal oxide
systems. Similar phenomena are known for tungsten-based catalytic
systems.23 Further spectroscopic studies
are ongoing and will be reported elsewhere.

electron microscopy image of Al2O3 and AlWxFy layers deposited
in silicon wafer and (b) schematic
of charge transport through coating layers to active materials.

This set of results implies that
the small overpotentials demonstrated
for AlWxFy-coated LiCoO2 may be ascribed to enhanced electron transport
with respect to Al2O3-coated LiCoO2. Furthermore, previous results suggest that transport properties
in these coated materials may be tuned according to the nature of
the integrated W-containing species, and further studies are ongoing
to better understand the factors governing the performance.

Conclusions
Protective coatings of Al2O3 and AlWxFy, deposited
via ALD on LiCoO2 particles and laminates, are shown to
be promising options for effectively mitigating the capacity fade
of LiCoO2 cathodes up to ∼4.5 V (vs Li/Li+). ALD coatings directly on laminates have small overpotentials relative
to coatings deposited on cathode powders owing to the preservation
of electronic pathways in coated, composite laminates. In the case
of particle coating, Al2O3 layers were found
to impose significantly higher impedance, especially during lithium
insertion, relative to AlWxFy layers, which showed little energy penalty. Near
equilibrium, open-circuit potentials from GITT measurements showed
that lithium diffusion within Al2O3 and AlWxFy is similar.
However, the incorporation of unique, metal-containing species in
the AlWxFy layers, by way of the novel ALD process introduced,12,22 may provide a way to enhance, or tune, the electronic properties
of such films while simultaneously enhancing surface stability at
high voltages.
