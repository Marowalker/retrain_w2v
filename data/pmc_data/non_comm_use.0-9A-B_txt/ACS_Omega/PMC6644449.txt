A mild
base-catalyzed protocol for the synthesis of substituted
nitroalkane derivatives has been developed under continuous flow using
a microreaction technique. This transformation basically involves
the 1,6-conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to p-quinone
methides, leading to the substituted nitroalkanes in good to excellent
yields.

Introduction
Over
the past several decades, the chemistry of nitroalkanes has
been recognized as one of the imperative research areas in synthetic
chemistry.1 Nitroalkanes serve as a valuable
synthon in the synthesis of natural products,2 biologically active unnatural active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs),3 and other useful compounds, such
as carbonyl compounds, carbohydrates, heterocycles, peptides, and
so forth.4 Although there are several different
methods available for the synthesis of nitroalkanes, the most popular
one is the introduction of a nitro group through the displacement
reaction between the alkyl halides and suitable inorganic or organic
nitrite sources.5 Subsequently, other substituted
nitroalkanes could be easily accessed from simple nitroalkanes through
the Henry or nitro–aldol reactions,6 alkylation/arylation reactions, and so forth.7 Moreover, the 1,4-conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to
enones,8 especially the enantioselective
version, to access other functionalized nitroalkanes in an enantiomerically
pure form, has been well-explored using either chiral organocatalysts9 or transition-metal catalysts.10 In addition, the 1,6-conjugate addition of nitroalkanes
to the linear dienone system has also been investigated using appropriate
catalytic systems.11 However, to the best
of our knowledge, the 1,6-conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to p-quinone methides (p-QMs) has not been
reported so far, although several reports,12 including ours,13 are available for the
vinylogous Michael addition of other active methylene compounds to p-QMs. Consequently, while working on the nucleophilic addition
reactions of p-QMs,14 we
have developed a base-catalyzed method for the synthesis of highly
substituted nitroalkane derivatives through the 1,6-conjugate addition
of nitroalkanes to p-QMs (Scheme 1), and the results are disclosed herein.

Scheme 1 1,6-Conjugate Addition of Nitroalkanes to p-QMs
As the microreaction technique
is emerging as a better alternative
to the batch reaction technique because of its operational simplicity
and higher efficiency,15 we have decided
to develop this methodology under continuous flow using a microreactor.
This particular technique has found many applications in synthetic
organic chemistry, especially in methods development,16 synthesis of natural products and APIs,17 and asymmetric synthesis.18 In
the recent past, we have also utilized this technique to access diarylalkanes
and diarylmethyl thioethers through the 1,6-conjugate addition of
dialkylzinc reagents and thiols, respectively, to p-QMs under continuous flow.19

Results and Discussion
The optimization experiments were performed with p-QM 1a and 2-nitropropane (2a) under continuous
flow conditions using a commercial glass microreactor having a total
volume of 100 μL. In all the experiments, a mixture of 1a and 2a was dissolved in 1 mL of solvent and
injected into the microreactor through a syringe. Parallelly, a solution
of a base in 1 mL of solvent was introduced into the microreactor
through another syringe.

The results of the optimization studies
are summarized in Table 1. Initially, a couple
of experiments were carried out using toluene as the solvent at room
temperature (rt) and at 80 °C (residence time = 2.5 min). However,
in both the experiments, the required product 3a was
not observed (entries 1 and 2). To our delight, when the reaction
was performed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with the residence time
of 2.5 min, 3a was isolated in 58% yield (entry 3). However,
in this case, we observed that 1a was slowly crystallizing
in the syringe over a period of time, and because of this some blockage
was observed in the microchannels. Hence, we decided to explore the
combination of a polar and a nonpolar solvent for further studies.
Subsequently, when the reaction was carried out in DMSO/toluene (98:2)
mixture, the yield of 3a was increased to 74% at rt (entry
4). The yield of 3a was further improved to 78% by increasing
the temperature to 80 °C under the flow rate of 40 μL/min
(entry 5). At this point, we believed that the yield of 3a would be improved to a great extent if the residence time of the
reaction mixture in the microchannels is increased. Accordingly, we
conducted another experiment by increasing the residence time to 10
min, and, as expected, 3a was obtained in 91% yield (entry
6). Unfortunately, other bases such as 4-DMAP and 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO) failed to catalyze the reaction (entries 7 and 8). DBN (1,5-diazabicyclo-[4.3.0]non-5-ene)
was found to be effective for this transformation, but the product 3a was obtained only in 60% yield (entry 9). Next, to find
the best solvent system for this transformation, a few optimization
experiments were performed in other solvents (entries 10–13).
In the case of MeCN and dimethylformamide (DMF), 3a was
isolated in 67 and 65% yields, respectively (entries 10 and 12), but
the reaction did not proceed in other solvents such as 1,4-dioxane
and tetrahydrofuran (THF; entries 11 and 13). Lowering the catalyst
loading (5–15 mol %) affected the yield of 3a considerably
(entries 14–16). Another experiment was carried out without
the base catalyst and, in this case, no reaction was observed (entry
17). This experiment obviously signifies that a base catalyst is required
for this transformation.

a Reaction conditions: All the experiments
were carried out with 0.12 mmol of 1a, 0.24 mmol of 2a, and 0.024 mmol of DBU in the solvent.

b 5 mol % of DBU was used.

c 10 mol % of DBU was used.

d 15 mol % of DBU was used;nd = not
detected.

After finding
the best reaction condition (entry 6, Table 1), the general applicability
of this protocol was evaluated using a wide range of p-QMs and nitroalkanes (Table 2). Most of the p-QMs 1b–k (substituted with electron-rich arenes) underwent the 1,6-addition
reaction with 2a and provided the corresponding 1,6-adducts
(3b–k) in the range of 66–93% yields. Other p-QMs 1l–n (substituted with electron-poor
arenes) also reacted with 2a efficiently and gave the
respective products 3l–n in excellent yields (86–92%).
The substrate scope was extended to haloarene-substituted (1o–t) and heteroaryl-substituted (1u) p-QMs and, in these cases, the 1,6-addition products 3o–u were obtained in the range of 61–84% yields.

Table 2 Substrate Scopea
a Reaction conditions: all the experiments
were carried out in 40 mg scale of 1(b–y). Yields
reported are isolated yields.

In the cases of p-QMs 1v and 1w (derived from fused aromatic aldehydes), the products 3v and 3w were isolated in 73 and 85% yields,
respectively. Delightfully, the present protocol worked moderately
well in the cases of other p-QMs 1x and 1y (derived from 2,6-dimethylphenol and propofol, respectively),
and the products 3x and 3y were obtained
in 59% yields. Other nitroalkanes such as nitromethane (2b) and 1-nitro-cyclopentane (2c) also reacted with 1a under standard conditions and gave the respective products 3z and 3aa in 52 and 69% yields, respectively.
When ethyl nitroacetate was used as a nucleophile, the respective
product 3ab was obtained in 55% yield as a mixture of
diastereomers (dr = 1:1). Similarly, ethyl 2-nitropropionate provided
the corresponding product 3ac in 52% yield and 1.3:1
diastereomeric ratio.

After evaluating the scope and limitations
of this transformation
using several p-QMs and nitroalkanes (Table 2), we wanted to compare the
efficiency of the continuous flow process against the batch process
in a large scale. In this regard, a gram-scale reaction was performed
using 1a and 2a under continuous flow as
well as batch processes (Scheme 2). As expected, in the case of the continuous flow
reaction, the product 3a was obtained in 80% yield. When
the same reaction was carried out at rt under batch conditions, 3a was obtained in 69% yield after 24 h and, in this case,
complete consumption of 1a was not observed. However,
when the batch reaction was carried out at 80 °C (standard conditions), 3a was obtained only in 54% yield. As the yield of 3a was substantially low at 80 °C, and also the complete conversion
of 1a was not observed even after 3 days, we suspected
that the retro-vinylogous Michael-type reaction was taking place in
the case of the batch process. We believe that this could be the main
reason for the lower yield of the product in the batch method. To
confirm this, a batch reaction was carried out, in which the 1,6-adduct 3a was treated with 20 mol % 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) in DMSO/toluene mixture at 80 °C and, as expected, the p-QM 1a was obtained in 69% yield (Scheme 2). Interestingly,
when the same batch reaction was carried out at rt, 1a was observed only in trace amounts. The above-mentioned experiments
led to the following conclusions. The 1,6-addition reaction between 1a and 2a is reversible only at a higher temperature
(in this case, 80 °C). Therefore, one can conclude that, in the
batch process, as the product 3a stays in the reaction
flask for a longer period, the extent of retro-1,6-addition reaction
is high. On the other hand, in the continuous flow method, though
the reaction channels are kept at 80 °C, the reaction mixture
does not stay in the microchannels for a long time. In fact, it is
continuously removed from the microchannels through the outlet and
collected in a flask that is kept at rt. This means the reaction mixture
gets cooled to rt immediately after coming out of the microchannels.
This clearly signifies that the retro-1,6-addition reaction is not
possible in this case as this reaction does not take place at rt (Scheme 2). This is the primary
reason for getting a higher yield of 3a in the continuous
flow method when compared to the batch process. From this observation,
one can also conclude that the continuous flow method is more advantageous
than the batch process for this particular transformation.

Scheme 2 Batch vs
Continuous Flow Processes and Control Experiments
The enantioselective version of this transformation
was attempted
using a couple of chiral amine catalysts. A few reactions were carried
out in the microreactor with 1d and 2a using
20 mol % of quinine (I) or quinidine (II) under different conditions, and the results are summarized in Scheme 3. When the reaction
was carried out at rt using I or II, the
product 3d was not formed in either case. However, when
another reaction was performed with I or II at 80 °C, 3d was obtained in 51 and 33% yields,
respectively. Unfortunately, in both the cases, adduct 3d was obtained as a racemic mixture (Scheme 3).

Conclusions
In conclusion,
an effective method for the synthesis of highly
substituted nitroalkane derivatives has been developed under continuous
flow conditions using the microreaction technology. This reaction
proceeds through a base-catalyzed 1,6-conjugate addition of nitroalkanes
to p-QMs, and the respective 1,6-adducts were obtained
in good yields. The comparison between the continuous flow method
and the batch process through control experiments revealed that the
former method is more advantageous when compared to the latter process,
as the retro-1,6-reaction was arrested in the former case and, as
a result, the 1,6-adducts were obtained in good to excellent yields.

General Methods
Continuous-flow reactions were performed
using a FlowStart Evo B-401 instrument purchased from Future Chemistry
Holding B.V. The microreactor was made up of borosilicate glass (channel
width 600 μm; channel depth 500 μm), with an effective
reaction volume of 100 μL. The microreactor setup has in-built
syringe pumps and all the reactions were carried out without using
a back pressure regulator. Most of the reagents and starting materials
were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification.
All p-QMs were prepared by following the literature
procedure.12a The melting points were recorded
on an SMP20 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. The 1H, 13C, and 19F spectra were recorded
in CDCl3 (400, 100, and 376 MHz, respectively) on a Bruker
FT-NMR spectrometer. The chemical shift (δ) values are reported
in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane, and the coupling
constants (J) are reported in Hertz (Hz). High-resolution
mass spectra were recorded on a Waters Q-TOF Premier-HAB213 spectrometer.
The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a
PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer. Thin-layer chromatography was performed
on Merck silica gel 60 F254 TLC pellets. Column chromatography
was carried out through silica gel (100–200 mesh) using EtOAc/hexane
as an eluent.

General Procedure for the 1,6-Conjugate Reaction
of Nitroalkanes
to p-Quinone Methides under Continuous Flow
p-QM (0.12 mmol, 1 equiv) and 2-nitroalkane (0.24
mmol, 2 equiv) were dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO/toluene (98:2) mixture
and taken in a syringe. DBU (0.024 mmol, 20 mol %) was dissolved in
1 mL of DMSO/toluene (98:2) mixture and taken in another syringe.
These two solutions were injected simultaneously through the microchannels
at the flow rates of 5 μL/min each (residence time = 10 min).
The temperature of the microchannels was maintained at 80 °C
throughout the reaction. The reaction mixture was collected at the
outlet and was quenched with water. It was extracted with diethyl
ether (10 mL × 2). The organic layer was concentrated under reduced
pressure, and the crude was then loaded on a silica gel column and
purified using the hexane/EtOAc mixture as an eluent to provide the
pure 1,6-adduct.

Procedure for the Gram–Scale Reaction of 1a with 2a under Continuous-Flow Conditions
p-QMs 1a (1.0 g, 3.1 mmol) and 2-nitropropane 2a (0.56 mL, 6.2 mmol) were dissolved in 9 mL of DMSO/toluene
(98:2) mixture and taken in a syringe. DBU (91 μL, 0.62 mmol)
was dissolved in 9 mL of DMSO/toluene (90:10) mixture and taken in
another syringe. These two solutions were injected simultaneously
through the microchannels at the flow rates of 5 μL/min each
(residence time = 10 min). The temperature of the microchannels was
maintained at 80 °C throughout the reaction. The reaction mixture
was collected at the outlet and was quenched with water. It was extracted
with diethyl ether (50 mL × 3). The organic layer was concentrated
under reduced pressure, and the crude was then loaded on a silica
gel column and purified using the hexane/EtOAc mixture as an eluent
to provide the pure 1,6-adduct 3a. The yield was 1.02
g (80%).

Procedure for the Gram–Scale Reaction of 1a with 2a under Conventional Batch Process
In
a 100 mL round-bottom flask, p-QM 1a (1.0 g, 3.1 mmol), 2-nitropropane 2a (0.56 mL, 6.2
mmol), and DBU (90 μL, 0.61 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL of
DMSO/toluene (90:10) mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred
at 80 °C for 72 h. The mixture was cooled to rt and diluted with
water. It was extracted with diethyl ether (50 mL × 3). The organic
layer was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the crude was then
loaded on a silica gel column and purified using the hexane/EtOAc
mixture as an eluent to provide the pure 1,6-adduct 3a. The yield was 0.69 g (54%).

Procedure for the Retro-1,6-Conjugate
Addition Reaction of 3a with DBU under Batch Process
In a 10 mL round-bottom
flask, a mixture of 1,6-adduct 3a (40 mg, 0.096 mmol)
and DBU (3 μL [stock solution], 0.019 mmol) was dissolved in
2 mL of DMSO/toluene (98:2) mixture, and the resulting mixture was
stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. The mixture was cooled to rt and diluted
with water. It was extracted with diethyl ether (10 mL × 3).
The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the
crude was then loaded on a silica gel column and purified using the
hexane/EtOAc mixture as an eluent to provide the pure 1,6-adduct 1a. The yield was 20.4 mg (65%).
