Cellulose
nanocrystal (CNC)-reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
nanocomposites were prepared by twin-screw extrusion followed by injection-molding
using a masterbatch approach. Noncovalent modification of CNCs was
performed with two different poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)-based surfactants to improve the
filler/matrix compatibility. They both have a PLLA block that is expected
to improve the compatibility with the PLA matrix and differ by the
polar head. It consists of either a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block
(PEG-b-PLLA) or an imidazolium group (Im-PLLA), that
is able to interact with the surface of
the CNCs. The morphological, structural, thermal, rheological, and
mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. The
different modes of interaction of the polar head of the surfactant
lead to different properties. However, the global decrease in the
molecular weight of PLA, induced by the short PLLA blocks from the
surfactants and the possible degradation during melt processing, results
in a plasticization effect and impacts the crystallization of the
matrix.

1 Introduction
Polymer
nanocomposites consisting of natural or synthetic polymers
reinforced with nanoscale particles have established themselves as
a promising class of materials. The nanoscale dispersion of the filler
in the polymer matrix leads to the generation of a tremendous amount
of interfacial contacts between both the parent components. If an
efficient stress transfer can be met at the interface, it results
in materials with improved mechanical properties and has huge potential
applications in different areas of technology.

Aiming to obtain
materials with a more environmentally friendly
life cycle, the emergence of bionanocomposites has gained great interest
during the last years, using renewable and biodegradable nanofillers
such as polysaccharide-based nanoparticles.1−3 Among these
particles, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as a principal
candidate to be considered as nanofillers for the preparation of such
nanocomposites. These nanoparticles exhibit some remarkable properties
such as high surface area, low density, and high mechanical strength
and stiffness (modulus in the range of 130–200 GPa).3 Interestingly, they come from abundant sources
and also present properties such as renewability and biodegradability
and have no toxicity.4 Moreover, the cost
of the raw material is less, and in the last few years, several facilities
producing CNCs in large scale have been announced.5

It is well-established that CNCs can positively influence
the macroscopic
properties of polymers.1−3 The potential of this nanomaterial has been proven
for special functional nanomaterials,6 but
improvement of the mechanical properties is the most common objective
targeted when preparing CNC-reinforced nanocomposites.7−9 However, the full reinforcing potential is limited by certain preparation
conditions, for example, casting/evaporation from a liquid medium
that allows the efficient formation of a rigid percolating network.10,11 Despite its efficiency, this processing method is time-consuming
and solvent-dependent.12−15 The application of industrial-scale processing methods (e.g., extrusion
and injection-molding) is still under investigation. These methods
are faster and solvent-free but can cause thermal and physical degradation
of the nanoparticles during processing.16−18 Furthermore, continuous
shear is imposed on the sample during melt processing, hindering the
possible formation of a percolating nanoparticle network and demanding
a higher volume fraction to reach similar properties than cast/evaporated
materials.19 Aside from these shearing
issues, the direct mixing of neat hydrophilic CNCs into melt polymer
matrices, in most cases being hydrophobic ones, remains inefficient.

Indeed, the right combination of a similar surface chemistry and
an adequate shear rate is needed to reach a satisfactory level of
particle dispersion within the polymeric matrix.20,21 As a consequence, the surface chemical modification of CNCs with
small appends or polymeric grafts has been extensively used to tune
their surface chemistry and enhance the dispersion of the filler in
a broad variety of polymers. Successful improvement of filler-polymer
compatibility and dispersion level has been reported. Unfortunately,
this methodology is quite difficult to scale up.22,23 Interestingly, the use of masterbatches was recently investigated
as a new way to avoid CNC aggregation during the drying stage before
extrusion.24,25 Nevertheless, the reinforcing
effect is often lower than expected and difficult to dissociate from
the CNC-induced crystallization phenomenon when using a semicrystalline
polymeric matrix. Alternative to covalent grafting of functional groups
or long chains to the CNC surface, the use of surfactants arises as
a more practical option. In addition, adsorption of the molecular
surfactant can be strengthened through electrostatic interactions
(CNCs usually present a negative surface charge resulting from the
sulfuric acid hydrolysis step).26

In the present study, we used noncovalent modification of CNCs
involving surfactants bearing a poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) block.
This tail is expected to interact with
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) that will be used as the matrix to prepare
nanocomposites. Two different PLLA-based surfactants were prepared,
which differ by their polar heads. It consists of either a poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) block (PEG-b-PLLA) or an imidazolium
group (Im-PLLA) that is able to interact in different ways with the
surface of the CNCs. The interaction of Im-PLLA and PEG-b-PLLA with CNCs was characterized, and both surfactants were used
as compatibilizing agents in the preparation of CNC–PLA composites.
The dispersion of the nanoparticles was studied by microscopic observations,
and the final properties of the nanocomposites were investigated using
mechanical and rheological tests.

2 Results
and Discussion
The PEG-b-PLLA diblock copolymer
and the Im-PLLA
surfactant were prepared by the ring-opening polymerization of lactide
initiated either from a PEG chain length of 2000 g·mol–1 or from 1-(11-hydroxy-undecyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide (Im),
using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) as the metal-free catalyst,
as shown in Figure 1. Synthesis conditions were reproduced from two referenced works,
for PEG-b-PLLA27 and for
Im-PLLA,28 and the DBU/alcohol (macro)initiator
ratio of 0.25/1 was selected to carry out the reactions.

The molecular characterizations were determined using size
exclusion
chromatography (SEC) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) (Figure S1) techniques, and the
relative data are reported in Table 1. A good control of both theoretical and experimental
parameters in relation to the 1H NMR results is achieved
except for Im-PLLA, where a high dispersity D̵ is noticed. However, the optimization of this reaction does not
concern the aim of this work.

One of the
most critical steps in the preparation of nanocomposites
by extrusion is to obtain an adequate dispersion of the nanoparticles
within the matrix and to limit the thermal degradation. Herein, we
used PLA as the matrix, and the masterbatch was prepared in the presence
of the compatibilizing agent, that is, PEG-b-PLLA
or Im-PLLA, and different CNC contents. The final composition and
codification of the samples after melt processing can be found in Table 2.

The visual appearance
of the ensuing injection-molded disks can
be found in Figure 2a. It can be observed that in the presence of compatibilizing agents,
the obtained materials do not show any visible sign of strong aggregation
or thermal and physical sample degradation, despite high-temperature
processing conditions and extrusion/injection-molding cycles. These
phenomena usually result in the presence of visible dots or color
alteration of the sample.

Figure 2 Disks prepared by injection-molding of extruded
samples of (a)
PLA and the surfactant (the value on the right side of the disk is
related to the CNC content) and (b) PLA and 5 wt % uncompatibilized
CNCs.

This scenario was observed for
the reference sample, as shown in Figure 2b. This sample was
prepared without a compatibilizer and contained only PLA and 5% CNCs,
which were directly mixed and melt-processed. Compared with samples
from Figure 2a, this
sample is darker, a clear sign of CNC degradation, and less transparent,
possibly because of CNC aggregation. This remarkable difference in
the final visual aspect of the produced disks suggests that using
the masterbatch approach combined with the compatibilizing agent can
greatly improve the thermal resistance and quality of CNC dispersion
within the matrix during extrusion.

A quantitative analysis
of the transparency of the samples was
obtained using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy. Figure 3 shows that the initial
values of transmittance obtained for PLA, PLAIm-PLLA, and PLAPEG-b-PLLA are
in the range founded by Müller et al. for PLA films.29 As reported by these authors, the presence of
additives leads to a decrease in the light transmittance. Addition
of PEG-b-PLLA to PLA increases the transmittance,
whereas addition of Im-PLLA slightly reduces it. As shown in Figure 3, the addition of
CNCs induces a global and systematic reduction in the disk transparency.
This evolution is weak for PLAIm-PLLA-based systems
but more marked for PLAPEG-b-PLLA. This reduction can be attributed to the increased crystallinity
of the sample because nanoparticles can act as nucleating agents for
the polymeric matrix and, at the same time, scatter the light in the
material.

The use of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments
can also
confirm the resistance of the pristine materials to thermal degradation.
The curves in Figure 4 show the thermal stability of neat PLA and compatibilized nanocomposite
films reinforced with 5 wt % CNCs.

Figure 4 (a) TGA and (b) differential thermogravimetric
(dTG) curves for
pristine PLA (black) and compatibilized nanocomposites (using Im-PLLA
or PEG-g-PLLA) reinforced with 5 wt % CNCs (PLAIm-PLLA+5CNC (blue) and PLAPEG-b-PLLA+5CNC (red)).

The thermal degradation of CNCs and CNC-reinforced nanocomposites
is a delicate issue. The use of H2SO4 in the
hydrolysis of cellulose causes the insertion of sulfate groups to
the surface of the isolated nanoparticles. Several examples of early
thermal degradation can be found in the literature, which can be attributed
to the presence of these sulfate groups.30,31 In the present work, all samples display good thermal stability,
with starting degradation temperatures above 200 °C. However,
it is worth noting that TGA experiments were performed under nitrogen,
and that nanocomposite processing was carried out under air. Nevertheless,
it was shown that CNC-reinforced PLA had a similar thermal stability
under air and inert nitrogen atmosphere, regardless of the surface
functionalization of CNCs or their dispersion in the matrix.32 It makes these materials suitable for processing
by extrusion, normally performed around 180 °C for the PLA matrix.
The pristine PLA sample displays a single degradation step that occurs
in the range of 300–350 °C, with a low residual mass.
The profile observed in the curves suggests that different degradation
mechanisms take place for composite samples.

The presence of
CNCs and humidity in the nanocomposites results
in multiple-stage degradation. The nanocomposite film compatibilized
with PEG-b-PLLA shows a clear first degradation step
at around 235 °C, which is probably related to the degradation
of cellulose.31,33 The second degradation step is
related to PLA chains and has its maximum at around 360 °C, suggesting
a higher thermal stability compared with that of pristine PLA. The
char residue is similar to neat PLA. For the nanocomposite film compatibilized
with Im-PLLA, an initial mass loss ending at 145 °C is observed,
which can be ascribed to the evaporation of moisture, suggesting a
higher hydrophilic character. This sample does not show any sign of
further separated degradation steps for CNCs, surfactants, and PLA,
probably because the thermal degradation of Im-PLLA and CNCs are in
the same range because of the early degradation of the surfactant
compared with the pristine PLA.28 Moreover,
it can suggest a good affinity and strong interaction between CNCs
and the surfactant. A higher char residue is observed for the PLAIm-PLLA sample. All TGA data are shown in Table 3.

Because
of the presence of two different compatibilizing agents
and the ensuing different surface CNC properties, the interactions
between the filler and the polymeric matrix should differ. The coating
of CNCs with the PEG homopolymer to increase the compatibility between
CNCs and hydrophobic polymers was already investigated, and successful
improvement of the filler dispersion was reported.34 Here, the macromolecular surfactants contain an additional
PLLA block that should provide a higher interaction with the polymer
matrix. In that sense, each block can offer strong van der Waals interactions
with each phase of the nanocomposite. In the case of Im-PLLA chains,
besides the PLLA block and its interaction with the polymer matrix,
the ionic liquid extremity possesses a positive charge that is able
to interact with the negative charges borne by the CNC surface. A
schematic representation of the different expected interactions is
shown in Figure 5.

CNCs and (a) Im-PLLA and (b) PEG-b-PLLA.

Figure 6 depicts
the representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the
cross-sectional areas of PLA (Figure 6a), PLAIm-PLLA (Figure 6c), PLAPEG-b-PLLA (Figure 6e), and nanocomposites reinforced with 5 wt % uncompatibilized
CNCs (Figure 6b) and
10 wt % CNCs compatibilized with Im-PLLA (Figure 6d) or PEG-b-PLLA (Figure 6f). The surfaces
of the cross-sections of the unfilled materials are quite uniform
with the broken filamentous polymer (Figure 6a,c,e). When adding 5 wt % uncompatibilized
CNCs (Figure 6b), well-distinguishable
micrometric CNC aggregates can be observed. Additionally, there are
visible voids in the PLA matrix proximal to the aggregates. For compatibilized
nanocomposites, the surface is similar to that of unfilled materials,
and no aggregates can be observed; these are strong lines of evidence
of improved CNC dispersion and filler/matrix adhesion. Micrographs
with different magnifications can be viewed in Figure S2.

The impact of the different interaction mechanisms between
the
surfactant and the CNC surface on the mechanical properties of the
final nanomaterials was therefore investigated by rheological measurements
performed at 180 °C, that is, in the melt state of the polymeric
matrix. The corresponding data can be found in Table 4. The addition of 10 wt % low viscosity surfactant
(consequence of their lower molecular weight) obviously decreases
the viscosity of the PLA matrix. At this temperature, both Im-PLLA
and PEG-b-PLLA chains are melted and present a very
low viscosity value. Therefore, the surfactant can act as a plasticizer
for the system, decreasing the global viscosity and modulus values.
However, most probably, the addition of the surfactant to PLA results
in the aggregation of their polar parts (kind of micelles).

For traditional systems, filler addition tends to increase the
viscosity of the sample, according to the equation presented by Einstein.35 However, some nanocomposites seem to break up
this rule. Understanding why nanoparticles can induce an increase
or decrease of viscosity according to their dimensions and volume
fraction was recently investigated.36 Here,
the addition of 5 wt % CNCs causes first a viscosity drop (Table 4), followed by an
increase for higher CNC contents (10 and 20 wt %). The same behavior
was reported for samples prepared with Im-PLLA and PEG-b-PLLA surfactants. When adding 5 wt % CNCs, the polar parts of the
surfactant molecules interact with the CNC surface but the relatively
high amount of low-molecular-weight surfactant, more than necessary
to coat the surface of the cellulosic nanoparticles, leaves dispersed
molecules, instead of micelles, that could contribute more efficiently
to the plasticization of PLA compared with unfilled PLAIm-PLLA and PLAPEG-b-PLLA.

For samples containing Im-PLLA (Figure 7a), it is observed that the addition of higher
CNC contents clearly increases not only the viscosity but also the G′ value. The samples containing 10 and 20 wt % CNCs
(open triangles and open diamonds, respectively) seem to reach a rheological
percolation regime (i.e., the pulsation-dependence of G′ evolution is lower than ω0.5),37 whereas the sample with a lower nanoparticle
content (open squares) displays a behavior similar to the neat PLAIm-PLLA sample (open circles) but with a lower viscosity
and storage modulus.

Figure 7 SAOS experiments for (a) PLAIm-PLLA and
(b) PLAPEG-b-PLLA nanocomposites
containing
0 (●, ○), 5 (■, □), 10 (▲, △),
and 20 (◆, ◇) wt % CNCs.

It is worth noting that particle percolation was reached
for a
relatively high volume fraction of particles. Besides the influence
of shear that causes particle alignment, extrusion is expected to
possibly break them, leading to particle size reduction.19,38 Taking this into consideration, the percolation definition adopted
here refers to a rheological percolation regime that is not equivalent
to the percolation network obtained for CNC nanocomposites prepared
by casting/evaporation methods.

On the other hand, the system
containing the PEG-b-PLLA copolymer presents a completely
different behavior (Figure 7b). The viscosity
value of the nanocomposites is systematically lower than that for
neat PLAPEG-b-PLLA (filled
circles) regardless of the CNC content. For this system, the addition
of CNCs also causes an increase in the storage modulus value for all
samples in the low-frequency range, but its magnitude is considerably
lower than that for PLAIm-PLLA highly loaded materials.
Similar conclusions can be obtained by observing the comparative relaxation
spectra of the samples (Figure S3).

We believe that this unexpected discrepancy between the storage
modulus values for both systems based on the same polymer matrix and
volume fraction of nanofillers can be explained by the presence of
different adsorption mechanisms on the CNC surface. According to Baeza
et al.,39 storage modulus (G′) curves with a logarithmic shape (or weak power law) can
be explained by the presence of polymer segments adsorbed on the nanoparticle
surface. These adsorption energies can present an exponential spectrum
of desorption times necessary for these segments to move. The authors
also argue that this weak slope of G′ ×
ω curve is characteristic of a particle network, independent
of the molecular weight. It agrees well with the PLAIm-PLLA system and the expected effect of charge adsorption of the surfactant
on the CNC surface. Moreover, the behavior is independent of the molecular
weight, resulting in a similar shape and G′
values for PLAIm-PLLA+10CNC and PLAIm-PLLA+20CNC in the lower frequency ranges, despite some discrepancy for higher
frequencies. The absence of charge for the PEG-b-PLLA
copolymer confers the system rheological profile with a classic curve
shape because the copolymer chains are not “frozen”
due to strong interactions with the filler.

The higher frequency
region of the G′ ×
ω curves (i.e., 100–300 rad·s–1) reflects the relaxation times of the polymeric chains present in
the sample, usually related to their length. It can be observed that
samples containing CNCs, PEG-b-PLLA, and Im-PLLA
display lower values of G′ in this frequency
range compared with the pristine PLA sample. It can indicate a reduction
in the molecular weight for the nanocomposite samples induced by extrusion/injection-molding
processing, which can corroborate with the initial viscosity drop
after the addition of the surfactants, as shown in Table 5. Najafi et al.40 suggest that the presence of OH groups on the surface of
the nanoparticles can bring new interactions with the carboxylic groups
present in some polymers, causing thermal degradation.

Because
of expected weaker adhesion between the filler and the
matrix, this plasticization effect seems to be much more significant
for the PLAPEG-b-PLLA samples. Figure 8 shows the pulsation-dependence
of G′ (filled symbols) and G″ (open symbols) for neat PLA (triangles) and highly filled
PLAIm-PLLA+20CNC (squares) and PLAPEG-b-PLLA+20CNC (circles) samples. It is observed
that PLA and PLAPEG-b-PLLA+20CNC samples present a liquidlike behavior, with G″
> G′ over the whole studied frequency range.
Contrarily, the PLAIm-PLLA+20CNC sample displays
a liquid–solid transition around 2 rad·s–1. A liquid behavior is normally expected for a neat polymer matrix,
but it is quite surprising for highly filled nanocomposites. It suggests
that PEG-b-PLLA causes a plasticization of the system.
On the contrary, Im-PLLA is probably more strongly attached to the
CNC surface, and these surfactant chains are not completely free to
slip along the polymer matrix chains. This is well-illustrated by
the G′ values determined at 1 rad·s–1. The storage modulus value for pristine PLA was found
to be 1.1 Pa, much lower than the values found for samples containing
CNCs. From Figure 8, we can see that PLAPEG-b-PLLA and PLAIm-PLLA reinforced with 20 wt % CNCs exhibit
values (at 1 rad·s–1) of 9.5 and 80 Pa, respectively.

(G′, filled symbols) and loss modulus (G″, open symbols) for PLA (▲, △), PLAIm-PLLA+20CNC (■, □), and PLAPEG-b-PLLA+20CNC (●, ○).

A more quantitative determination of the polymer
viscoelastic behavior
can be accessed by the evaluation of the tangent of the loss angle
value (tan δ = G″/G′) or damping. Considering tan δ values, the sample
behaves as a viscoelastic liquid when it presents values higher than
one and as a viscoelastic solid when it presents values lower than
one. Figure 9 shows
the tan δ(ω) curves for all of the studied samples. Clearly,
three groups of samples can be observed. The unfilled polymer systems
(PLA, PLAIm-PLLA, and PLAPEG-b-PLLA indicated by crosses, open circles,
and filled circles, respectively) display the highest tan δ
values and therefore the most prominent liquid behavior. Addition
of 5 wt % CNCs compatibilized with Im-PLLA (open squares) induces
a reduction in the tan δ value but still characteristic of a
dominant liquid behavior. The same behavior was reported for CNCs
compatibilized with PEG-b-PLLA regardless of the
CNC content (filled symbols). The samples containing Im-PLLA and higher
CNC contents (with a possible percolating CNC network) (open triangles
and open diamonds) present tan δ values lower than one (i.e.,
viscoelastic solid behavior), which corroborates the previous results.
The transition from tan δ > 1 to tan δ < 1 for these
samples occurs at around 2–3 rad·s–1, the transition point. Other works in the literature also found
such different behaviors for samples with the same composition. Unlike
these previous works, we did not vary the processing conditions41 or the nature of the PLA matrix,42 modifying just the nature of the compatibilizing
agent. The tan δ values estimated at 1 rad·s–1 are collected in Table 4.

symbols correspond to Im-PLLA systems, and filled symbols correspond
to PEG-b-PLLA systems.

Rheological measurements strongly depend on the quality of
the
filler dispersion because of the effects of hydrodynamic forces, Brownian
motion, and colloidal stresses. The presence of the particles modifies
the hydrodynamic forces by disturbing the liquid flow medium, increasing
its resistance to flow. Brownian forces result from random movements
of the particles within the liquid, causing their diffusion and disrupting
the possible particle organization caused by external forces. In concentrated
systems, colloidal forces take place because of the decrease in the
particle–particle distance, leading them to interact. These
three forces individually contribute to the rheological response of
the system. It makes parameters such as particle aspect ratio, volume
fraction, viscosity, and shear rate to contribute to the obtained
results.

The relationship between the hydrodynamic (represented
by Reynolds
number) and Brownian forces (Schmidt number) for a system containing
cylindrical particles is given by the Peclet number (Pe) defined by eq 1. 1  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, γ̇ is the shear rate, L is the cylinder length, d is the cylinder diameter,
η is the viscosity, and T is the temperature
(K). A previous study discussed the influence of the particles and
the matrix viscosity for nanocomposites based on long carbon nanotubes
that lead to huge Pe numbers because of very small
Reynolds number and limited contribution of nanotubes to the Brownian
motion.38

Kamal and Khoshkava43 used this relationship
to define a PLA/CNC system in terms of the dispersion state; they
state that for an ideally dispersed system, the Pe number should be 52. Pe values were calculated
at an arbitrary shear rate of 0.1 s–1 and are reported
in Table 4. CNCs used
in our study have different dimensions and aspect ratios around 28
(CNCs with L/d equal to 11 were
used in ref (43)),
and the calculated Pe values are lower but suggest
a better dispersion of the nanoparticles in the presence of Im-PLLA
compared with PEG-b-PLLA. However, it is worth noting
that the systems described above were limited to two-component systems.
Here, the presence of copolymers certainly influences the properties
of the system and (eq 1) could present deviations. Hence, applying this equation can be
useful for simple comparisons, but it is necessary to keep its limitations
in mind.

Thermal properties of injected nanocomposite disks
were also investigated
using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Despite injection-molding
processing, Table 5 shows that the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the melting temperature (Tm) values found for the pristine PLA sample are very similar to those
reported.44 Because these properties are
related to the molecular weight of the polymer, it suggests that severe
thermal degradation does not take place during processing of the pristine
material. The simple addition of PEG-b-PLLA or Im-PLLA
to the matrix reduces the Tg value up
to 5 °C, which can be attributed to the plasticization effect
and global reduction of the average molecular weight of the sample
or a more severe shortening of PLA chains during processing. This
result agrees with the rheological measurements. The addition of the
surfactant to the PLA matrix also induces a significant decrease in
the cold crystallization temperature of PLA (Table 5), but the degree of crystallinity determined
during the second heating cycle is increased. However, it is worth
noting that the determination of the degree of crystallinity excluded
the surfactant, even if it is expected to participate in crystallization.
Brüster et al.45 reported an increase
in the cold crystallization temperature induced by the degradation
of PLA chains and the ensuing chain scission. Tm values are slightly shifted to lower temperatures when adding
the surfactants. Commercial PLA can be found as l-lactide, d-lactide, or dl-lactide isomeric form. The first two
forms are considered as semicrystalline polymers, unlike the last
one that is considered as amorphous.42 Here,
we used the l-lactide form. It can explain the initial crystallinity
of the PLA sample, with a melting enthalpy of 32.7 J·g–1, which corresponds to a degree of crystallinity of 35.2%.

The presence of CNCs does not seem to cause a pronounced effect
on the thermal properties of the matrix (Table 5). However, for nanocomposite materials,
a clear increase in the degree of crystallinity is reported because
of the well-known nucleating role of CNCs, which was evidenced for
different polymers including PLA.46−49 Nevertheless, as previously mentioned,
the crystallinity of nanocomposites was calculated based only on the
mass of pristine PLA in the system. Therefore, we made the assumption
that PLLA blocks from the surfactants did not participate in crystallization,
which can induce deviation of the obtained values. It is also observed
that PEG-b-PLLA seems to be more efficient to increase
the crystallinity of the matrix. This observation is in good agreement
with the stronger evolution of the light transmittance of the film
with the CNC content (Figure 3).

Figure 10 shows
the DSC curves for all studied samples. During the experiments, it
was not possible to observe the thermal transitions for pure PEG-b-PLLA and Im-PLLA samples. However, all samples containing
these agents present a small exothermic peak around 155 °C. We
believe that it can be attributed to a small crystallization of these
short chains that is probably followed by its melting in the same
temperature range as for PLA chains.

and nanocomposites based on
(b) PLAIm-PLLA or (c) PLAPEG-b-PLLA. Endothermic peak down.

Infrared spectroscopy analysis
was also performed for some injection-molded
samples. The results, presented in Figure S4, show that all samples present very similar characteristics despite
the presence of PEG-b-PLLA or Im-PLLA. Similarly
to the spectra obtained for the surfactants, the most intense peaks
are related to the PLA structure. The peaks of C=O (1730 cm–1) and C–O (around 1080 cm–1) dominate the spectrum.

The similarity of Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) curves for
PLA materials before and after melt processing was already described
by Brüster et al.45 The authors
proposed a degradation mechanism for PLA and plasticized PLA materials
based on chain shortening that cannot be observed using this technique.
Besides, the suggestion that PLA can be more resistant to thermal
degradation than plasticized PLA cannot be observed using FTIR.

Besides rheological and modulus measurements at high temperatures,
the samples were evaluated by stress/strain tests aiming to study
the effect of the surfactant and CNC addition on the mechanical properties
of the samples at room temperature (i.e., in the solid state). A remark
should be made about the difficulty to handle the CNC-reinforced injection-molded
samples. These samples were remarkably brittle and difficult to analyze
because of the formation of cracks generated by the jaws of the equipment.
Consequently, it was decided to focus the analysis on highly filled
samples. The results are reported in Table 6.

PLA is usually described as a tough polymer that can
show various
mechanical properties depending on its commercial grade. Parameters
such as Young’s modulus can be found varying between 0.9 and
4 GPa. Several studies investigated the effect of processing conditions
and the addition of nanofillers to PLA, and in general reported just
moderate modification in the modulus values. Pillin et al.50 showed limited impact of successive melt processing
of PLA on its mechanical properties. They tend to remain stable after
three or four cycles of injection, with a reduction of only 6% in
the Young’s modulus value after seven recycling cycles, with
some fluctuations in the values in the series. Our results show that
the addition of both surfactants to the PLA matrix causes a decrease
in the Young’s modulus and strength values. It can be attributed
to the global reduction in the average molecular weight of the sample
because the surfactants have low Mw values
acting as plasticizers. The effect of PLA plasticization using PEG
has been abundantly investigated, and a decrease in the modulus and
strength with an increase in the elongation at break is generally
reported.51 In our case, even the elongation
at break decreases when adding the surfactants.

The addition
of CNCs did not show any significant improvement in
the mechanical properties, except a small increase in the modulus
value, similar to that obtained by Camarero-Espinosa et al.52 The natural stiffness of PLA and the brittleness
generated by the filler most probably mask any effect caused by the
stronger interaction between Im-PLLA and CNC nanoparticles.

3 Conclusions
This work intended to prepare compatibilizing
agents consisting
of a diblock (PEG-b-PLLA) copolymer and an ionic
liquid-PLA (Im-PLLA) polymer to improve the dispersion of CNCs in
a hydrophobic matrix. The structural characterization of the compatibilizing
agents showed that PEG-b-PLLA and Im-PLLA were successfully
synthesized. Their use during melt extrusion and injection-molding
of CNC-reinforced PLA nanocomposites clearly increased the dispersion
of the nanoparticles within the matrix but different adsorption mechanisms
on the CNC surface resulted in different rheological and mechanical
properties. The positive charge of Im-PLLA seems to create ionic interactions
between the ionic liquid block and CNCs. Besides good dispersion,
it also leads to the formation of a rheological percolating network
of particles for higher filler contents, providing higher values of
storage modulus than that for PEG-b-PLLA-based samples.
However, thermal and rheological experiments also suggest a global
decrease in the average molecular weight of the matrix because of
the presence of the surfactant and possible shortening of PLA chains
during melt processing, resulting in a plasticization effect of the
matrix. This phenomenon competes with the expected reinforcing effect
of CNCs at room temperature. PLA is a rigid polymer whose properties
are not strongly affected by the decrease in the molecular weight
(e.g., Young’s modulus), but secondary effects such as crystallization
can cause the sample to become more brittle and difficult to handle.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Pure
ramie fibers were
obtained from Stucken Melchers GmbH & Co. (Germany). l-Lactide was supplied by Purac (The Netherlands) and recrystallized
from dry toluene. Poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (PEGME) (Mn = 2000 g·mol–1, with
a polydispersity index D̵ of 1.05) was provided
by Fluka Chemika. DBU as a metal-free catalyst was purchased from
Aldrich and distilled over barium oxide before use. Chloroform was
dried using a MBRAUN Solvent Purification System (model MB-SPS 800)
equipped with alumina drying columns. Heptane was purchased from VWR
used as received. Acetic acid was purchased from ChemLab. 1-Methylimidazole
(99%, Merck) and 11-bromoundecanol (Aldrich, 98%) were used as received.
A commercially available extrusion-grade PLA (NatureWorks 4032D) designed
especially for the production of biaxially oriented films was used
as received (Mn = 133 500 ±
5000 g·mol–1, D̵ = 1.94
± 0.06 as determined from SEC, and 1.4 ± 0.2% d-isomer content as determined by the supplier).

4.2 Preparation of CNCs
CNCs were isolated
from ramie fibers according to the procedure described elsewhere.53 Purified ramie fibers were cut into small pieces
and treated with 4% NaOH solution at 80 °C for 2 h. After washing
until neutrality, the fibers were subjected to acid hydrolysis with
sulfuric acid solution (65 wt %) at 55 °C for 30 min under strong
mechanical stirring. The obtained suspension was filtered through
a sintered glass funnel no. 1 and washed with water through a sequence
of centrifugation cycles. The resultant suspension was then dialyzed
against deionized water until neutrality and concentrated to 4 wt
%. The obtained nanoparticles displayed the expected rodlike shape,
with an average length around 200 nm and an average width of 7 nm,
as characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM).53 Their crystallinity index was determined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) experiments using the Segal method, and a value of 85% was obtained
(Figure S5).

4.3 Preparation
of PLLA-Based Surfactants
The preparation of both surfactants
was done according to previous
studies for Im-PLLA28,54 and for PEG-b-PLLA.27 Details are reported in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Masterbatch
Preparation
To improve
the dispersion of CNCs into the polymer matrix during extrusion, a
masterbatch consisting of CNCs and the desired PLLA-based surfactant
was prepared. First, the suspension of nanoparticles was exchanged
from water to acetone and in sequence to dimethylformamide (DMF) through
successive centrifugation cycles (10 000 rpm at 10 °C
during 15 min). Then, the suspension of CNCs in the organic solvent
was sonicated for 6 min and kept at 4 °C. The preparation of
masterbatches was made by the addition of the surfactant into the
CNC suspension. After polymer dissolution and homogenization by magnetic
stirring, the suspension was homogenized through sonication for 10
min. The suspension was cast in a glass plate and dried under air
circulation at 100 °C for 2 h.

4.5 Nanocomposite
Processing
The dilution
of the masterbatch in the PLA matrix was performed by extrusion. The
desired mass of masterbatch was extruded with the PLA powder in a
twin-screw DSM microcompounder at 170 °C and 150 rpm for 5 min.
The material was collected and stored in a desiccator. In sequence,
the extruded samples were injected in disk form (diameter 25 mm and
thickness 1.5 mm) using a HAAKE MiniJet II equipment at 170 °C
and a 200 bar pressure.

4.6 Characterization Techniques
XRD analyses
were performed on a powder diffractometer (Siemens D 5000) using Cu
Kα radiation at room temperature in the range of 2θ =
10–50° at a scanning rate of 2°·min–1. The crystallinity index value was calculated by the Segal method.

1H NMR analyses were performed using CDCl3 as the solvent, with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.
The data were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer
operating at 500 MHz, equipped with a broadband observe (BBO) probe.
The spectra were obtained over 32 scans.

SEC was performed in
chloroform (flow rate of 1 mL·min–1 at 30 °C)
with an Agilent 1200 series chromatograph
equipped with a PL-DG802 degasser, an isocatric HPLC pump (flow rate
= 1 mL·min–1), a marathon autosampler (loop
volume = 100 μL and solution concn = 1 mg·mL–1), a refractive index detector, and three columns (a PL gel 5 μm
guard and PL gel Mixed-D 5 μm columns).

Infrared spectra
were recorded on an FTIR PerkinElmer Spectrum
One spectrometer. Solid samples were analyzed using spectral width
ranging from 600 to 4000 cm–1 with a 4 cm–1 resolution and an accumulation of 32 scans. All analyses were carried
out in the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode at room temperature.
FTIR measurements were performed for the synthesized surfactants and
injected films after rheological tests.

Quantitative information
about light transmittance of the injected
disks was obtained with an UV–vis Shimadzu UV 2401-PC spectrophotometer
at a wavelength of 800 nm.

TGA experiments of the two surfactants,
masterbatch and pristine
PLA, were performed under N2 atmosphere with a heating
rate of 10 °C·min–1 using a PerkinElmer
TGA-6 equipment.

SEM was used to investigate the morphology
of the nanocomposite
films using a FEI (MED) Quanta 200 instrument. Tensile fracture samples
were coated with gold and glued to the sample holder for cross-sectional
observation.

DSC analyses were carried out with a TA DSC Q100
equipment, where
the sample (weight of 10 ± 2 mg) was sealed in an aluminum pan
and analyzed as follows. During the first cycle, a heating rate of
40 °C·min–1 from ambient temperature to
185 °C was applied, and it was followed by a 2 min isotherm to
ensure material melting. A subsequent cooling step (20 °C·min–1) from melt to ambient temperature and second heating
up to 185 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 were applied. The DSC data were analyzed for the cooling and second
heating scans.

The rheological behavior of the materials was
characterized with
an ARG2 equipment from TA Instruments. SAOS tests were performed with
plate–plate (25 mm) geometry to study the polymer and the nanocomposites
in oscillatory modes under air atmosphere in the range of 0.1–300
rad·s–1. The amplitude sweep tests show a strained
linear region around 10% for all samples. Experimental data were obtained
by using a 1% strain.

The tensile tests were performed using
an Instron 4501 machine
with a load cell of 5 kN capacity. The specimens were injection-molded
under the same conditions described for disks, and ASTM D638-10 samples
were obtained. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C with
a cross-head speed of 10 mm·min–1.
