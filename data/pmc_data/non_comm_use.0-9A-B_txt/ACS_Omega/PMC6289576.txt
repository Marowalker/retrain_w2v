Single-chain nanoparticles
(SCNPs) are ultrasmall soft nanomaterials
constructed via intrachain cross-linking of individual precursor polymer
chains, with promising prospects for nanomedicine, catalysis, and
sensing, among other different fields. SCNPs are versatile building
blocks for the construction of new fluorescent probes with ultrasmall
size, higher brightness, and better photostability than previous particle-based
systems. Herein, we report on a new, fast, and efficient method to
produce SCNPs with intense fluorescence emission in solution which
is based on the photoactivation of appropriate aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) cross-linking molecules containing azide functional
groups. Remarkably, the presence of the azide moiety—that can
be transformed to highly reactive nitrene species upon UV irradiation—was
found to be essential for the SCNPs to display intense fluorescence
emission. We attribute the fluorescence properties of the SCNPs to
the immobilization of the initially nonfluorescent AIE molecules via
intrachain cross-linking upon photoactivation. Such cross-linking-induced
immobilization process activates the AIE mechanism and, hence, leads
to fluorescent SCNPs in both solution and solid state.

Introduction
Single-chain polymer
nanoparticles (SCNPs) are soft nanomaterials
constructed via intrachain cross-linking of individual precursor polymer
chains,1−7 with promising prospects for nanomedicine,8−11 catalysis,12−19 sensing,20,21 and other different application
fields.22 The SCNP local pockets formed
upon chain collapse at high dilution provide a unique (and tunable)
environment for attachment—either temporally or permanently—of
active species, such as drugs, catalytic metal ions, or dyes.23,24 Moreover, SCNPs are promising building blocks for the construction
of new fluorescent probes with ultrasmall size, higher brightness,
and better photostability than previous particle-based systems.

In general, fluorescent nanoprobes are receiving enthusiastic pursuits
from medical scientists because of their promising potential applications
in cell imaging, targeting, tracing, and therapeutics.25 Conventional luminescent nanoparticles are mainly
based on inorganic quantum dots,26 lanthanide
ion-doped nanomaterials,27 and metallic
nanoclusters28 because of their excellent
photostability with narrow emission, subnanometer size, and superior
upconversion performance, although potential toxicity issues and poor
biodegradability have largely hindered their common employment in
biomedical applications.29

Even if
the field of SCNPs is still very incipient, a variety of
fluorescent SCNPs have been synthesized through four different synthetic
approaches based on common, traditional fluorophores:30 (i) functionalization of the SCNP precursor polymer with
a conventional fluorophore molecule before intrachain cross-linking;31 (ii) physical entrapment of an external traditional
fluorophore molecule into nonfluorescent SCNPs32 or in situ generation of this fluorophore molecule inside
the SCNP;33 (iii) postfunctionalization
of the SCNP surface via chemical reaction with appropriate, complementary
reactive fluorophore molecules;34 and (iv)
generation of fluorophore functional moieties through intramolecular
cross-linking.35

In spite of recent
advances in this field, to the best of our knowledge,
the use of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) cross-linking fluorophores36 to endow SCNPs with fluorescent properties has
not been investigated yet. AIE compounds37 are opposite to conventional fluorescent probes which often suffer
from the well-known (and deleterious) aggregation-caused quenching
(ACQ) effect.38 On the contrary, AIE molecules—as
first described by Tang and co-workers39 in 2001—are nearly nonemissive compounds in solution but
become highly fluorescent upon restriction of their intramolecular
rotations (the so-called RIR mechanism37). In short, AIE fluorophores usually show very weak fluorescence
or nonemissivity when molecularly dissolved in a good solvent, but
are highly emissive when aggregate—or after molecular immobilization—because
of the restriction of the intramolecular rotation in the aggregate
(immobilized) state leading the excitations to decay radiatively.
For a more detailed description of the AIE effect, the RIR mechanism,
and several practical applications of AIE compounds in biological
sensors, chemical probes, optoelectronic devices, and intelligent
materials, the reader is referred to recent, comprehensive review
papers.36−38

Currently, the development of fluorescent polymers
and nanomaterials
based on AIE probes is a field of intense activity.40−54 In this article, we report on a new photoactivation strategy developed
for AIE cross-linking molecules containing azide moieties allowing
the fast and efficient synthesis at room temperature (r.t.) of highly
fluorescent SCNPs in solution showing excellent stability of the fluorescence
emission intensity over time. A further motivation of this work is
the synthesis of SCNPs showing fluorescent properties also in the
solid state, i.e., free from ACQ effects often observed for SCNPs
based on traditional fluorophores. It is worth of mention that this
new methodology facilitates (i) to “turn-on” the fluorescence
of SCNPs with a simple ultraviolet (UV) source and (ii) to synthesize—at
r.t. in 1 h of reaction time—SCNPs showing fluorescent properties
both in solution and in the solid state. Remarkably, this work opens
a new avenue to endow a variety of other nanostructured polymeric
materials (e.g., block copolymers, microgels, dendrimers, and micelles)
with intense fluorescence emission based on the new strategy of photoactivation
of AIE molecules here disclosed.

Results and Discussion
We investigate in this work a new strategy toward highly fluorescent
SCNPs based on the combined photoactivation of an AIE cross-linking
compound containing azide functional groups, Silole-N3, and a precursor P containing
α-diazo-β-ketoester units (see Scheme 1). AIE compounds are a new kind of fluorophores
that are nearly nonemissive molecules in solution but become highly
emissive when aggregate—or are immobilized—because of
the restriction of intramolecular rotations leading the excitations
to decay radiatively.36−39 We hypothesized that by generating a combination of both highly
reactive nitrene55 species (from Silole-N3) and highly reactive carbene56 species (from precursor P) via
UV irradiation, the probability of efficient immobilization of the
AIE compound in the resulting SCNP will increase considerably, when
compared to the use of an AIE compound without azide functional groups
(hexaphenylsilole, HPS). To confirm this hypothesis,
we performed two complementary experiments.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration
of the Synthesis of Precursor P
In a control experiment, we placed precursor P in
the CH2Cl2 solvent at high dilution (0.5 mg/mL) in the presence
of HPS (AIE compound without azide functional groups).
We employed a molar ratio of HPS to α-diazo-β-ketoester
units of 1/2. As illustrated in Figure 1, even if efficient SCNP formation was observed by
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) due to an increase in retention
time upon chain compaction (Figure 1B), the resulting SCNPs NP were found
to be essentially nonfluorescent nanomaterials (Figure 1D). In this case, upon irradiation of the
α-diazo-β-ketoester units of precursor P,
highly reactive carbene species were generated (see below) accompanied
by N2 formation and further N2 release from the solution. The
resulting carbenes—which have high tendency to react through
many different pathways—56 promoted
intrachain cross-linking reactions leading to the observed chain compaction.
Confirmation of successful photoinduced carbene generation from precursor P was obtained through complementary Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis (EA) measurements, as illustrated
in Figure 2 and summarized
in Table 1. Consequently,
even if carbene generation was proved to be successful (efficiency
of carbene generation >90%), most of the subsequent carbene C–H
insertion reactions56 were intrachain reactions
without allowing immobilization of a significant amount of external HPS molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of SCNPs (although without fluorescence properties) synthesized
through photoactivated carbene generation.

from precursor P in the presence
a nonfunctional AIE molecule (HPS) gives essentially
nonfluorescent materials (NP), whereas using a bifunctional

highly fluorescent properties. (B) SEC traces of P and NP showing an increase in retention time upon chain compaction,

On the other hand, when the synthesis
was performed under exactly
the same conditions but replacing HPS by Silole-N3, single-chain polymer nanoparticles endowed
with highly fluorescent properties (FNP) were obtained
(see Figure 1A,C,D).
These complementary experiments confirmed that the presence of the
azide moiety in the AIE compound—that generates highly reactive
nitrene species upon UV irradiation—is essential for FNP to display intense fluorescence emission. The progressive
compaction of precursor P in the presence of Silole-N3 upon increasing the UV irradiation time
is shown in Figure 3, as determined by SEC experiments. The increase in retention time
observed by SEC is a consequence of the reduction in hydrodynamic
size of precursor P because of intramolecular cross-linking57 upon the simultaneous generation of highly reactive
nitrene and carbene species. The unimolecular (single-chain) nature
of FNP was confirmed through absolute Mw measurements, using multiangle laser light scattering
(MALLS) detection during the SEC experiments58 (see Table 2). Hence,
upon SCNP formation, an increase in Mw was observed that can be attributed (within the experimental uncertainty
of the MALLS technique) to the progressive immobilization of Silole-N3 molecules in the nanoparticles.
Concomitantly, a reduction in both the average values of radius of
gyration (Rg) and hydrodynamic radius
(Rh) of precursor P was observed
(Table 2), as a consequence
of its collapse to SCNPs. This behavior is in good agreement with
previous results reported in the literature.22

Figure 4A illustrates
the fluorescent properties of the resulting FNP in the
tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution as determined by fluorescence
spectroscopy (FS). The maximum fluorescence emission was obtained
for nanoparticles generated after 60 min of UV irradiation time (Figure 4B), and it was located
at λem ≈ 455 nm by using λex = 364 nm, with a fluorescent quantum yield of Φ = 0.065 (see
the Supporting Information). Above this
optimum photoirradiation time during synthesis, a decrease in fluorescence
emission intensity was observed that could be a consequence either
of morphological transitions59 or to photodegradation
of the AIE compound via secondary reactions. To determine if a change
in morphology was taking place at long UV irradiation times, SCNPs FNP obtained after 60 and 120 min of UV irradiation were visualized,
after solvent removal, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
It is worth of mention that characterization of SCNPs by TEM is a
highly complicated task because of the change in conformation often
observed upon solvent removal, the unavoidable nanoparticle–substrate
interactions, and the presence of locally compact domains.60 As illustrated in Figure 5, no significant change in the (near-spherical)
SCNP shape was visible by TEM, so we can tentatively attribute the
reduction in fluorescence emission intensity after prolonged UV irradiation
to competitive photodegradation reactions. Nevertheless, more studies—out
of the scope of the current work—are required to confirm this
assumption.

for SCNPs FNP synthesized after 60 min of UV irradiation.

60 min (scale bar: 50 nm) and 120 min (scale bar: 100 nm) of UV irradiation
time.

It is worth mentioning that purification
of FNP from
potentially unreacted Silole-N3 molecules was highly facilitated by the excellent solubility of Silole-N3 in Et2O (a precipitant for FNP).
In addition to efficient nitrene generation from the azide—containing
AIE compound, confirmation of successful carbene generation from α-diazo-β-ketoester
units upon UV irradiation of precursor P was obtained
from FTIR spectroscopy measurements, as illustrated in Figure 6. Hence, upon SCNP formation,
the complete disappearance of the FTIR vibration band associated with
the diazo moieties (ν ≈ 2200 cm–1)
was observed. Finally, the excellent stability of the fluorescence
emission intensity of the purified FNP over time in solution
is shown in Figure 7A, whereas Figure 7B illustrates the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of FNP in bulk.

Conclusions
This work establishes a new strategy based on
photoactivation of
appropriate AIE molecules containing azide functional groups for the
fast and efficient generation of SCNPs with fluorescence emission
in both solution and solid state. We demonstrate that by the generation
of a combination of both highly reactive nitrene species (from an
azide-containing AIE cross-linking molecule, Silole-N3) and highly reactive carbene species (from
an appropriate polymeric precursor containing α-diazo-β-ketoester
units, P) via UV irradiation, the probability of efficient
immobilization of the AIE compound in the resulting SCNP increases
considerably, when compared to the use of an AIE compound without
azide functional groups. Confirmation of successful single-chain compaction
upon UV irradiation of precursor P in the presence of Silole-N3 at high dilution is obtained
by SEC with multidetection, including MALLS detector (for absolute Mw and Rg values)
and VIS detector (for Rh data). The optimum
UV irradiation time during the SCNP formation process is found to
be 60 min. The resulting fluorescent SCNPs FNP (Rh = 9 nm) show a maximum emission peak in the THF solvent centered at λem ≈ 455
nm and excellent stability of the fluorescence emission intensity
over time, as determined by FS. Moreover, FNP retains
its fluorescent properties in the solid state. To conclude, this work
opens a new way to endow other soft nanomaterials (e.g., microgels,
dendrimers, and micelles) with intense fluorescence emission based
on the new strategy of photoactivation of AIE molecules here disclosed.

Techniques
Experimental UV Irradiation
Setup
UV irradiation experiments
were performed using a Hamamatsu UV spot light source (LC8, Hg–Xe
Lamp, UV intensity: 3.5 W/cm2) equipped with an A9616-05
filter [transmittance wavelength: 300–400 nm (λmax = 365 nm); transmitted intensity: 80%] and the corresponding UV-light
guide. The distance from the guide to the solution containing the
SCNP precursor was 10 cm. The open area during irradiation was 2 cm2. A picture of the experimental setup is available in the
Supporting Information of ref (61).

detection: a differential refractive index detector (Optilab Rex,
Wyatt), a MALLS detector (MiniDawn Treos, Wyatt), and a viscosimetric
(VIS) detector (ViscoStar-II, Wyatt). Data analysis was performed
with ASTRA Software (version 6.1) from Wyatt. THF was
used as an eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A value of dn/dc = 0.083 was used for precursors and
SCNPs.

1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
1H NMR spectra were recorded at r.t. on a Bruker spectrometer operating

Procedures
Synthesis
of the Precursor
The whole synthesis of precursor P was performed protected from light. In a typical procedure,
a random copolymer of MMA and AEMA (485
mg, 0.77 mmol) prepared according to the methodology reported in ref (41) (weight average molecular
weight, Mw (SEC/MALLS) = 208 kDa; polydispersity, Đ = 1.25; molar fraction of AEMA units
(1H NMR) = 32% x = 0.32) was dissolved
in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) at r.t. Then, p-CBSA (250 mg, 1.1 mmol) and Et3N (0.4 mL, 2.87 mmol) were added, and the mixture was maintained
under stirring for 24 h (see Scheme 1). After reaction, the solution was concentrated and
precipitated in MeOH and the resulting precursor P was dried in a vacuum oven in the dark [P:
Yield = 73%; Mw (SEC/MALLS) = 289 kDa; Đ = 1.24; molar fraction of α-diazo-β-ketoester
units (EA) = 23%, y = 0.23; radius of gyration, Rg (SEC/MALLS) = 17.9 ± 1.0 nm; hydrodynamic
radius, Rh (SEC/VIS) = 11.4 ± 0.1
nm].

Synthesis of Single-Chain Polymer Nanoparticles in the Presence
of HPS
In a typical reaction, precursor P (6 mg, 9.5 × 10–3 mmol) and HPS (2.6 mg, 4.75 × 10–3 mmol) were
dissolved in CH2Cl2 (12 mL) at r.t. and the solution was subject
to UV light irradiation through an open area of 2 cm2 in
the 300–400 wavelength range (λmax = 365 nm)
for 60 min. The resulting (nonfluorescent) SCNPs NP were
purified by precipitation in Et2O and further drying in a vacuum oven [NP: Yield = 72%, Mw (SEC/MALLS) = 290 kDa; Đ = 1.25; Rg (SEC/MALLS)
= 7.3 ± 1.1 nm, Rh (SEC/VIS) = 9.5
± 1.1 nm].

Synthesis of Single-Chain Polymer Nanoparticles
in the Presence
of Silole-N3
In a typical
reaction, precursor P (6 mg, 9.5 × 10–3 mmol) and Silole-N3 (2.5 mg,
4.75 × 10–3 mmol) were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (12 mL) at r.t. and the solution was subject to UV light irradiation
(λmax = 365 nm) for 60 min. The resulting highly
fluorescent SCNPs FNP were purified by precipitation
in Et2O and further
drying in a vacuum oven [FNP: yield = 78%, Mw (SEC/MALLS) = 330 kDa; Đ = 1.26; Rg (SEC/MALLS) = 6.2 ± 2.0 nm, Rh (SEC/VIS) = 9.0 ± 0.3 nm; fluorescent quantum yield,
