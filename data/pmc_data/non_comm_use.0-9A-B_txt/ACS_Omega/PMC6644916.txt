Two water-stable
zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs) (NU-1000 and UiO-67) have been synthesized in various size
scales (100–2000 nm) for the adsorptive removal of glyphosate
from the aqueous media. Both NU-1000 and UiO-67 possess a three-dimensional
structure; NU-1000 consists of triangular micropores and wide mesoporous
channels (31 Å), whereas UiO-67 has cage-like pores [octahedral
(16 Å) and tetrahedral (14 Å) cages]. NU-1000 comprises
Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(H2O)4(OH)4, and
UiO-67 contains Zr6O4(OH)4 as secondary
building units. These units act as Lewis acid nodes and can interact
with the Lewis base phosphate group of the glyphosate. The time taken
for reaching equilibrium is found to be reduced considerably as the
size of the MOF decreases. The smaller the particle size, the lesser
is the diffusion barrier for the analyte, which enhances the interaction
between Lewis acidic metal nodes and the Lewis basic center of the
glyphosate molecule. NU-1000 was found to be better compared to UiO-67,
both in terms of efficiency and reusability. This might be due to
the larger pore diameters of the NU-1000. Theoretical calculations
revealed that the interaction energy of glyphosate with the nodes
of NU-1000 is higher (−37.63 KJ mol–1) compared
to UiO-67 (−17.37 KJ mol–1), which might
be the possible reason for the higher efficiency of NU-1000.

Introduction
Organophosphorus compounds
(OPs) are highly noxious.1 They not only
cause eutrophication but also bind
to the neurotransmitter, acetyl cholinesterase, thereby leading to
nerve paralysis and death of living beings.2 OPs enter our drinking water mainly through agricultural runoff.3 Hence, the removal of OPs from water is very
important. There are various ways to eradicate OPs from aqueous media;
among those, enzymatic biodegradation, photocatalytic degradation,
and adsorption are commonly used.4,5 Among these
methods, adsorption is the simplest and cost-effective way. Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of porous materials for the
adsorptive removal of lethal chemicals.6,7 The tunable
size and shape of the pores, stable framework, and the opportunity
for desirable post-synthetic modification can vary the adsorption
capacity of the MOFs.8 Recent findings
revealed the possibility of reducing diffusion limitations by downsizing
the mesoporous MOFs.9−11 Therefore, the blend of mesopores in the nano-sized
MOF system will engender new-generation materials with enhanced and
efficient properties for the applications such as catalysis, adsorption,
and so forth.

The MOFs with Zr metal nodes are well-known for
the adsorption
of analyte molecules containing the phosphate group from aqueous media.12 The affinity upsurges with the number of the
Zr–OH bonds and the missing linker effect.8a,8b Hence, the MOFs with plenty of Zr–(OH)–Zr bridge bonds
resemble the phosphotriesterase enzyme with similar Zn–(OH)–Zn
moieties, which degrades the OPs gradually but at a dawdling pace.13

Glyphosate is a widely used broad-spectrum
herbicide which causes
damage to human cells.14,15 Studies showed that the half-life
of glyphosate in soil might extend to months, which increases the
risk of erosion and contamination of surface and groundwater sources.16,17 Once it reaches the water bodies, the half-life increases. Moreover,
the possible degradation (hydrolysis) product of glyphosate is aminomethylphosphonic
acid which is as equally toxic as glyphosate.18 Therefore, adsorptive removal of glyphosate from aqueous medium
is essential to protect the environment and human health.

Hupp
and co-workers have investigated the catalytic activity of
NU-1000 and UiO-67 in degrading the chemical warfare agents and/or
their simulants. Zr6 nodes with terminal water and hydroxyl
groups were the catalytic sites.9a,12 It was also
shown that the catalytic efficiency escalates as the size of the MOFs
reduced to nano-regime, whereby increasing the surface area (higher
surface to volume ratio).9 Lange et al.
in 2014 reported the adsorptive removal of methyl parathion using
a copper MOF from water.19 In 2015, Zhu
et al. have studied the use of UiO-67 in removing the OPs (glyphosate
and glufosinate) from the water through the adsorption process.20

In this work, synthesis of two zirconium-based
MOFs (NU-1000 and
UiO-67) in various size ranges (100–2000 nm) have been carried
out for the adsorptive removal of the glyphosate from aqueous medium(Scheme 1). We have studied
how the efficiency of adsorption increased as the particle size decreases.
It was also shown that the time taken for reaching adsorption equilibrium
was considerably diminished as the particle size decreased to the
nano-size range and the effect was found more pronounced for NU-1000
over UiO-67. The interaction between the glyphosate and MOFs was probed
through XPS and IR data, respectively. Theoretical calculations revealed
that the interaction energy of the glyphosate with NU-1000 is 20.26
KJ mol–1 higher than that of UiO-67.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
Procedure of the MOFs
Results and Discussion
We have synthesized NU-1000
and UiO-67 using modified literature
methods (see the Supporting Information).21,22 Structure of the MOFs and glyphosate are
given in the Supporting Information (Figure
S1). The experimental powder X-ray diffraction data of the synthesized
MOFs matched with the simulated data, indicating the phase purity
of all the samples (Figure S2). Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed the formation of particles
with mean sizes ranging from 100 to 2000 nm (Figures 1 and S3). Thermogravimetric
analysis showed that the solvent molecules residing in the pores of
the structure starts escaping at 75 °C; after that, from 300
°C, the dehydration of Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes starts and the structure disintegrates at temperature ≫
400 °C (Figure S4). The nitrogen adsorption
isotherms were showing an upsurge in the surface area, and the pore
size distribution plots illustrate the escalation in the pore diameter
as the particle size decreases (Figures S5–S7).

Figure 1 SEM images of NU-1000 (A–D) and UiO-67 (E–H) MOFs
of various sizes (ranges from 100 to 2000 nm).

NU-1000 comprises eight connected Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(H2O)4(OH)4 nodes interconnected by tetra
topic
1,3,6,8 (p-benzoate) pyrene (TBAPy4–) linkers. UiO-67 is a build-up of 12-connected Zr6O4(OH)4 clusters nodes and linear 4,4′-biphenyl
dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) ligands. It possesses a face-centered cubic
arrangement of the Zr6 clusters. Both NU-1000 and UiO-67
contain free and bridging −OH and H2O groups. NU-1000
has wide mesoporous channels (31 Å), and UiO-67 has octahedral
(16 Å) and tetrahedral (14 Å) cages (Scheme 1 and Figure S1). The synthesis of NU-1000 and UiO-67 MOFs of different particle
sizes was carried out by the coordination modulation method (see the Supporting Information). The synthesized MOFs
were used for the systematic study of the removal of toxic glyphosate
molecule from water.

The adsorption of glyphosate as a function
of particle sizes of
NU-1000 and UiO-67 have been carried out under identical conditions
(same glyphosate concentration and the amount of MOFs) at room temperature.
The supernatants were examined to measure the concentration of elemental
phosphorus and zirconium using ICP-AES measurements. Control experiments
without the MOFs showed negligible change in the concentration of
phosphorus. The absence of zirconium in the supernatant revealed the
stability of both the MOFs during the adsorption process. The adsorption
percentage as a function of time is shown in Figure 2. It was shown that adsorption efficiency
is enhanced with the downsizing of the MOFs, and the effect was more
pronounced in case of NU-1000 compared to UiO-67. We have carried
out several experiments to probe the interaction between the MOF samples
and glyphosate which are discussed below. The MOF samples were analyzed
after the adsorption study followed by washing.

Figure 2 Adsorption efficiency
of (a) NU-1000 and (b) UiO-67 MOF samples.

The IR spectra of MOFs after the adsorption study have been
recorded,
and the incorporation of glyphosate was evident from the presence
of the characteristics peaks of glyphosate (Figure 3). All the characteristics peaks of the MOFs
are red-shifted because of the possible interaction between the MOF
and glyphosate. The triplet at 793, 722, and 662 cm–1 (labeled with magenta stars) are the peaks corresponding to the
Zr–O longitudinal and transverse mode vibrations, respectively.
The sharp and intense peaks at 1615 and 1417 cm–1 (labeled with red stars) are in- and out-of-plane stretching of
the carboxylate groups of the ligand, respectively. The three peaks
at 1164, 1100, and 1032 cm–1 correspond to the P=O
bond and the antisymmetric and symmetric vibrations of P–O
in the glyphosate, respectively (labeled with blue stars).4,20

spectra of the MOFs (a) NU-1000 and (b) UiO-67 before and after
the adsorption studies. Note that only one sample of each NU-1000
and UiO-67 (100–200 nm) is shown.

All the MOF samples after the adsorption study were analyzed
using
SEM and SEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). It
was found that all the samples maintained the structural morphology
after the adsorption of glyphosate (Figure S8). The presence of elemental phosphorus confirmed the adsorption
indisputably (Figure S9). We have calculated
the elemental phosphorus contents in each particle size for both the
MOFs, and it was observed that the amount of phosphorus increases
as the particles size decreases (Table S1). The SEM–EDX spectrum was re-recorded after washing (washed
with water and acetone and then heated at particular temperature under
vacuum). The absence of phosphorus peaks confirmed the complete removal
of adsorbed glyphosate on washing (Figure S10).

The stability of the washed MOF samples were studied using
powder
XRD. The NU-1000 MOF retained the structural stability even after
washing and is used for three more adsorption cycles. The structural
integrity of the UiO-67 samples was lost after washing (Figure S11).

The N2 adsorption
study illustrates that the surface
area and the pore diameter of the MOF samples increase with downsizing
the MOFs. The enhancement of the rate of removal of glyphosate by
nanoscale MOFs might be due to the large external surface area and
hence shortened diffusion paths. The surface area of the NU-1000 samples
was found to be diminishing after each consecutive cycle. It may be
due to the destruction of many of the active sites during the successive
activation process after each cycle (Figure S12). In the case of UiO-67, the structure was degraded after the first
cycle (Figure S13). This degradation could
be due to the capillary action which leads to the channel collapse
during the activation process of UiO-67.

The XPS spectra were
collected before and after the adsorption
studies (Figures 4 and S14). It shows that the binding energy of Zr–OH2, Zr–OH, and Zr–O–Zr bonds have shifted
after adsorption of glyphosate (Table S2). This evidenced the interaction between the metal nodes of the
MOFs and glyphosate.

Figure 4 XPS spectrum of the MOFs (a) NU-1000 and (b) UiO-67 after
the adsorption
studies. Note: only one sample for each NU-1000 and UiO-67 (100–200
nm) is shown.

Mechanism of Adsorption
The adsorption capacity with
varying particle sizes as a function of time is provided in Figure 2. The early rapid
adsorption in all the cases could be due to the availability of plenty
of vacant active sites in the activated MOF structure. Figure 2 shows that the saturation
time of adsorption decreases substantially as the size decreases from
micro to nanoscale. In the case of NU-1000 with a size range of 100–200
nm, the 50% adsorption took place in about 3 min, while it took almost
9 min for the UiO-67 MOF of similar size to show the same activity.
This difference in adsorption capacity between two MOFs was observed
with all the particle sizes.

The Zr metal nodes in the framework
of both the MOFs act as the adsorption sites for the glyphosate.23 The Zr metal nodes are Lewis acidic and have
a higher affinity for the phosphate functional group of glyphosate
which is a Lewis base. It is well-known that the utilization of modulators
during the synthesis not only helps to tune the size of the MOF particles
but also increases the possibility of formation of missing linker
sites. These missing linkers are compensated by the −OH groups
which are highly reactive toward organophosphates. As the size of
the MOF decreases, the possibility of missing linker formation increases
which could be the main reason for the enhancement in the adsorption
efficiency.

The adsorption kinetic studies reveals that the
pseudo-second order
model is more appropriate in explaining the adsorption process where
the correlation coefficients and qe are
matching better with the experimental results (Tables S3–S18 and Figures S15–S22). The theory of adsorption with chelating ligands following pseudo-second-order
kinetics is widely accepted. Here, the mesoporosity and the carboxylic
acid groups in the structure of the MOF make them act as a chelating
agent, thereby supporting the pseudo-second-order kinetics.24−26 The reaction involves three main components, MOF, glyphosate, and
the solvent water. Because water is in excess, its concentration can
be neglected, thereby supporting pseudo-second-order kinetics.27−36

The adsorption isotherms for the glyphosate adsorption (both
the
Langmuir and Freundlich models) on the MOFs are provided in Figure 5. The obtained parameters
and the correlation coefficients are presented in Table 1. It was found that the Langmuir
model has a better fit than the Freundlich model in all the cases.
This proved that MOF surfaces are homogeneous in nature, where the
adsorption sites are uniformly distributed. The maximum adsorption
capacity is found to be more for NU-1000 samples compared to UiO-67.
Moreover, it is clear that as the size of the MOF decreases, the adsorption
capacity increases. We have compared the adsorption coefficient with
the reported results, and it shows that the adsorption coefficient
of these nanoscale MOFs is higher compared to the reported materials
in the literature (Table 2).

The higher
efficiency of the NU-1000 compared to that of UiO-67
can be explained by considering the structural uniqueness of NU-1000,
as adsorption competence is mainly determined by the likelihood of
contact between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and the diffusion
pathway. The wide hexagonal pores of diameter 31 Å in NU-1000
allow the glyphosate solution to have better interactions with the
metal nodes. The improved efficiency is supported by the theoretical
calculations as well. Theoretical calculations showed that the adsorption
energy for glyphosate on NU-1000 is −37.63 KJ mol–1, while that for UiO-67 is only −17.37 kJ mol–1. The negative values of adsorption energies indicate a strong interaction
of the glyphosate with the Zr clusters of the MOFs. Also, the Zr···O–P
interatomic distance during the polar interaction in the case of NU-1000
was found to be 4.2 Å, while it is 4.6 Å for UiO-67. The
higher adsorption energy and the shorter Zr···O–P
distance indicates a stronger interaction of glyphosate with NU-1000
over UiO-67 (Figure S23).37−41

Conclusions
The synthesis of two Zr-based MOFs (NU-1000
and UiO-67) in various
size ranges from nanometer to micrometer have been carried out. The
presence of the Zr6 cluster with the terminal H2O molecule and the −OH group makes these clusters active sites
for specific adsorption. We have exploited the affinity of the Lewis
acidic Zr metal centers in the corresponding MOFs toward the phosphate
group in the pesticide glyphosate for its adsorptive removal from
aqueous media. Theoretical calculations revealed that glyphosate has
higher interactions with NU-1000 compared to UiO-67, and it is because
of the high adsorption energy and the lower Zr···O–P
distance. Kinetic studies show that the adsorption follows pseudo-second-order
kinetics. The saturation time of the adsorption decreases dramatically
as the particle size decreases from micron to nano-regime. This enhancement
in the adsorption rate and capacity might be due to the increase in
the external surface area and reduction in the diffusion barrier.
This outcome of size-dependent properties of MOFs may inspire people/other
research groups to synthesize new nanoscale mesoporous MOFs for various
other applications.

Experimental Section
Adsorption Studies
A stock solution of the glyphosate
with a concentration of 9.879 mmol L–1 was prepared
in water. The adsorption capacity of the MOFs was tested using the
glyphosate solution (50 mL, 0.01 mmol L–1) with
3 mg of activated MOFs for 5 h. The supernatant was collected at certain
intervals of time and the change in the concentration of glyphosate
was investigated by measuring the amount of phosphorus using ICP-AES.
Control experiments without MOFs were also carried out. The concentration
of the elemental zirconium was measured to check the disintegration
of the MOFs during the study. The adsorption study was repeated three
times to obtain reproducible results.

The adsorption kinetic
experiments were carried out using glyphosate solution (50 mL, 0.1
mmol L–1) with 10 mg of MOF samples. The solution
was kept in a mechanical shaker and rotated at a speed of 180 rpm
for 300 min. The supernatant was collected at regular intervals, and
the amounts of adsorbed glyphosate were measured from the difference
between the initial (C0) and equilibrium
(Ce) concentrations in the supernatant
after centrifugation. The equilibrium uptake was calculated by the
given equation 1  where qe (mmol
g–1) is the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the
glyphosate on the MOF samples. V is the volume of
the glyphosate solution used (L), and W is the weight
of the MOF sample (g). Experimental kinetic data were fitted with
the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models. The pseudo-first-order
equation is given by 2  where qe and qt are the amounts of glyphosate
adsorbed by the MOF at equilibrium and at the time, t, respectively. k1 is the pseudo-first-order
rate constant (min–1). Plotting log10(qe – qt) as a function of time, t gives
a straight line, and the value of k1 can
be calculated from its slope.

For the pseudo-second-order model,
the equation used is 3    where qe and qt are the same as above and k2 is the pseudo-second-order rate constant (g
mmol–1 min–1). When t/qt is plotted against
time, t a linear plot is obtained. The values of qe and k2 can be
calculated from the slope and the intercept of the straight line.

Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorption isotherms for the
adsorption of glyphosate on the MOFs was obtained at 25 °C. The
maximum shaking time was 300 min. Two widely used isotherm models,
Langmuir and Freundlich models, were employed to simulate the adsorption.
The linear equation for the Langmuir adsorption model is 4  where kL represents
the Langmuir constant (L mmol–1) that relates to
the energy of adsorption and affinity of the binding sites and qmax represents the maximum adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent (mmol g–1).

The linear form
of the Freundlich adsorption isotherm equation is 5  where kF is the
Freundlich adsorption constant (mmol1–n Ln g–1) that
relates to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n is the adsorption intensity.

Theoretical Studies
Theoretical calculations have been
carried out to find the interaction energy between the Zr MOF and
the glyphosate molecule. The stability of the Zr cluster–glyphosate
system was calculated from the adsorption energy using the given equation 6  where Etotal is
the energy of the system consisting of the Zr cluster and glyphosate
and Ecluster and Eglyphosate represent the energies of the isolated Zr cluster
and glyphosate, respectively.
