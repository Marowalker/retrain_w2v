A droplet impacting
on inclined surfaces yields more complex outcomes
than on normal impact and the effect of the inclining angle on the
impact dynamics is still in controversy. Here, we show that a drop
impacting on inclined superhydrophobic surfaces exhibits an asymmetric
rebound with a distinctive spreading and retraction along the lateral
and tangential directions. Meanwhile, there is an obvious contact
time reduction with the increase of the inclining angle and impact
velocity. We demonstrate that the contact time reduction is attributed
to the asymmetric drop spreading and retraction, which endows a fast
drop detachment. Simple analyses are presented to interpret this phenomenon,
which is in a good agreement with the experimental results.

Introduction
Since the discovery
of the unique properties of lotus leaves, superhydrophobic
surfaces have received considerable attention owing to their distinct
properties rendered by their large contact angle and small contact
angle hysteresis.1−4 The complete rebound of an impacting droplet from superhydrophobic
surfaces is relevant for many practical applications, including anti-icing,5−7 dropwise condensation,8,9 and antifouling.10−16 Various research studies have been conducted to reveal the effect
of surface morphology on the impact outcomes.17−21 On horizontal superhydrophobic surfaces, an impinging
drop first undergoes an inertia-dominant lateral spreading, then retracts
on the liquid-repellent surface to minimize the surface energy, and
finally takes off in the vertical direction. Normally, the drop retains
a symmetrically circular shape during the whole process. The contact
time, defined as the time span between the moment the drop comes into
contact with the surface and the moment of detachment, keeps constant
and is independent of the impact velocities.22

Note that the contact time minimization is highly desirable
in
various practical applications.7,14 Recent research studies
have witnessed a dramatic increase in the mechanism of reducing the
liquid–solid contact time. Bird et al. first introduced center-assisted
recoil to accelerate the retraction process to shorten the contact
time.23 During the droplet impacting on
a macrotextured ridge with a diameter (a) of hundreds
of micrometers, the liquid on the peak of the ridge retained a thin
film and retracted as , where h is the film thickness,
and ρ and γ are the density and surface tension of the
impacting droplet, respectively. The droplet retracted faster along
the ridge than perpendicular to it and tended to fragment and decreased
the distance and time required for recoil, resulting in an overall
reduced contact time. According to the scaling law22 of contact time , splitting an impacting drop into
smaller
ones (a reduced drop radius r0) could
shorten the contact time. This is verified by introducing microstructures
to promote splashing at large impact velocities.18 Similar research using asymmetric retraction to reduce
the contact time was further implemented by Liu et al. and Gauthier
et al.24,25 In their experiments, a spreading drop retracted
faster in one direction than perpendicular to it while retaining an
integrated shape.

Alternately, a superhydrophobic surface with
a point-like defect
endows ring bouncing, during which the spreading liquid film is punctured
by the defect and the impacting drop adopts an unusual ring shape
as it leaves the substrate.26 Upon impact,
the punctured film de-wets outwards until it collides with the outer
receding rim moving in the opposite direction. The collision drives
the drop upwards and takes off as a ring, leading to reduced contact
time. In 2014, Liu et al. made an exciting breakthrough in sculpturing
superhydrophobic surfaces to promote “pancake bouncing”
to shorten the contact time by ∼80%.27 The so-called “pancake bouncing” results from the
rectification of capillary energy stored in the penetrated liquid
into upward motion sufficient to lift the droplet. Moreover, on truncated
pyramidal post arrays with the edge length increasing continuously
and linearly from top to bottom in the vertical direction, robust
pancake bouncing occurred over a wide range of impact velocities.28

There is already a wealth of knowledge
about normal drop impact
and rebound characteristics on a superhydrophobic surface. However,
inclined impact exists in most of the practical applications and the
droplet bouncing outcomes differ greatly from those on normal impact.29−33 Moreover, the contact time variation along with the inclining angle
is still a controversy. Yeong et al. found that although inclined
and normal impacts behaved similarly at low Weber numbers, inclined
impact shows pronounced spreading asymmetry at high Weber numbers
and the contact time is independent of surface inclination.34 Here, Weber number (We) is
a dimensionless quantity, defined as We = ρv02D0/γ,
with v0 being the impacting velocity at
the moment of the drop touches the substrate. On oblique impact, normal
Weber number (Wen) is defined as Wen = ρ(v0 cos
α)2D0/γ, where
α is the surface inclining angle, D0 (D0 = 2r0) is the drop diameter, and v0 cos α
relates to the normal impact velocity. In contrast, Antonini et al.
showed that surfaces placed obliquely promoted the drop rebound than
that placed horizontally, rendering a reduced contact time by ∼40%.35 Zhang et al. achieved similar results and attributed
the contact time reduction to the emptying of capillary energy stored
in the penetrated liquid into the underneath microstructures, endowing
an upward motion adequate to lift the drop faster.36

In this work, we show that inclined superhydrophobic
surfaces reduce
the contact time via modifying the spreading and retraction process
of impacting drops. During impact, the drop promotes a larger spreading
in the tangential direction than that in the lateral direction, followed
by a fast retraction in the lateral direction and finally leaves the
surface in an elongated shape. Simple analysis was put forward to
reveal the asymmetric bouncing mechanism.

Experimental Section
In the experiment, superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated using
an electrochemical machining technique on an aluminum substrate with
a size of 40 mm × 80 mm × 4 mm. For the sample preparation,
the aluminum substrate was polished using #800, #1500, and #2000 abrasive
papers successively and then ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and
deionized water for 10 min, to remove the surface impurities. After
drying by compressed air, the aluminum substrates as the anode and
the lead plate as the cathode were put into 0.1 M sodium chloride
electrolyte at 0.5 A/cm2 current density for 6 min. The
as-fabricated substrate was then thoroughly rinsed with deionized
water, followed by drying in a nitrogen stream. Finally, the substrate
was immersed in 0.5 mM n-hexane solution of trichloro-(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane for ∼50 min, followed by heat treatment
at 150 °C in air for ∼30 min to render the surface superhydrophobic.

As evidenced in the scanning electron micrography (SEM) images
in Figure 1a,b, the
surface is uniformly coated by loosely clumped textures (Figure 1a) with a rugged
block roughness (Figure 1b) of a size of ∼2 μm. By averaging five individual
measurements, the advancing and receding contact angles (∼4
μL, with a diameter of 1.97 mm) on the modified surface were
measured to be 158.5° ± 1.0° and 154.3° ±
1.0°, respectively (Figure 1c), using an OCA25 Standard Contact Angle Goniometer,
suggesting that the complex structures required for excellent superhydrophobicity
have been obtained by electrochemical etching. Droplet impact experiments
were conducted in an ambient environment, at room temperature with
60% relative humidity. Deionized water droplets of ∼12 μL
(D0 = 2.85 mm) were released from a syringe
pump equipped with a fine needle at a flow rate of 2 μL/s. The
distance of the needle above the surface was adjusted to change the
initial impact velocity. Two synchronized high-speed cameras (Photron
SA4) were used to capture the droplet impacting dynamics both from
the side and normal views (the shooting direction is parallel with
the normal direction as shown in Figure 1d) at a frame rate of 10 000 fps.
The dynamic change of impacting drops was analyzed using ImageJ software
(Version 1.46, National Institutes of Health).

Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
the image sequences of droplets impinging on the horizontal superhydrophobic
surface at We = 37 (Video S1, the first row). The impacting drop holds a circular symmetry during
the whole spreading and retraction process and finally bounces off
the surface at ∼17.2 ms , which
is consistent with previous research.22 However, the impacting drop exhibits an asymmetric
bouncing dynamics on tilting surfaces (see Figure 1d for the clarification of directions). For
example, on the superhydrophobic surface with an inclining angle of
α = 60°, as exhibited in Figure 2b, the impacting drop initially spreads isotropically
at Wen = 37, but the spreading becomes
anisotropic as the drop starts to retract. Specifically, when the
liquid in the lateral direction started to retract at ∼3.9
ms, the liquid in the tangential direction continues to spread. Once
the liquid in the lateral direction has fully contracted at ∼12.6
ms , the drop leaves the surface in
an elongated
shape along the tangential direction (Video S1, the second row). The contact time is reduced by ∼30% compared
to that on the nontilting surface.

to spread; once the liquid in the lateral direction has fully contracted

Figure 3a plots
the variation of the contact time with Weber numbers at different
surface inclining angles. It generally shows that the contact time
decreases with the increase of the inclining angle and Weber number.
To better understand the dependence of contact time on the inclining
angle, we decouple the contact time into spreading time (ts) and retraction time (tr), as displayed in Figure 3b. It is obvious that the spreading time is almost independent
of the inclining angle. However, the retraction time decreases strongly
as the inclining angle increases.

(b) Spreading time ts (left) and retraction
time tr (right) as a function of Wen at different inclining angles. Open symbols
indicate ts and closed symbols indicate tr.

To interpret the effect of the inclining angle on contact
time
reduction, we first consider the effect of the inclining angle on
the droplet spreading process. A droplet in the oblique impact is
subject to a combination of downward motion along the tilting surface
with an impinging velocity of v0 sin α
together with motion normal to the surface with an impinging velocity
of v0 cos α. A droplet impacting
on the tilting surface process a tangential component of momentum
that enables the drop to spread larger along the tangential direction. Figure 4a shows the nondimensionalized
drop spreading diameter (D*) as a function of time
in the lateral and tangential directions at Wen = 37 and surface tilting angle α = 60°. To quantify
the spreading asymmetry, we define Q as the ratio
of the maximum values of the drop spreading diameters in the tangential
and lateral directions. Figure 4b shows the variation of Q as a function
of the inclining angle at different Wen. It is obvious that a large inclining angle at high Weber number
leads to a pronounced spreading asymmetry. Note that in normal impact
(α = 0°), Q is equal to unity, suggesting
that the asymmetric spreading is regulated by the surface inclining
angle.

of Q as a function of inclining angles α. Q is the ratio of the maximum drop spreading diameter in
the tangential and lateral directions.

A simple hydrodynamic analysis is employed to explain the
contact
time reduction with the droplet deformation on inclined superhydrophobic
surfaces. Note that drop spreading on superhydrophobic surfaces is
mainly governed by inertia, only retraction is considered here. After
the drop spreads to its maximal extension, the liquid film subsequently
de-wets the surface. The retraction force is primarily driven by a
reduction of surface energy, which forms a rim to collect the liquid
and move inwards. On a nontilting surface, the impacting drop retracts
in a circular symmetric shape and the surface energy of the central
film of radius r can be expressed as Es ≈ πr2γ(1
– cos θ), where r is the radius of the
liquid film and θ is the surface apparent contact angle.37 On inclined surfaces, however, owing to the
tangential component of impacting velocity, the central film can be
approximated as an ellipse with a short axis x in
the lateral direction and a long axis y in the tangential
direction, as shown in Figure 2b. The surface energy of the elliptical liquid film can be
approximated as E = πxyγ(1
– cos θ). Therefore, the retraction force in the lateral
direction becomes F = ∂E/∂x ≈ πyγ(1 – cos
θ).

As the viscous effect can be neglected because the
Ohnesorge number
in the experiments is ∼0.002 which is far less than 1, the
retraction dynamics is dominated by a competition between the surface
tension of the central film and the inertia of the rim.38 The momentum conservation for the liquid film
in the lateral direction can be written as , where m is the mass of
the rim. As the major y changes little as the lateral
retraction starts, we can get , with h being the film
thickness. Then the retraction speed is . Clanet et al.38 have
proposed a widely used scaling model to predict the maximum
spreading diameter Dmax as Dmax ≈ 0.9D0Wen0.25. However, the relationship
between Dmax and We tends
to slightly vary among different studies depending on the surface
tested.30,38,39 Here, we measured
the maximum spreading diameter of drops impacting on the horizontal
superhydrophobic surface and obtained the scaling of Dmax ≈ 0.79D0Wen0.29 through the regression fitting,
as shown in Figure 5a. Yeong et al. have built a theoretical model for the maximum spreading
in the tangential direction as Dymax* = Dmax* + cWet, where c (c > 0) is the scaling factor and Wet is the Weber number component in the tangential direction,
expressed as Wet = tan2 αWen.34 Following this
model, we determined the value of the scaling factor c = 0.0033 using the experimental data in the range of 0–45°.
To verify the scaling factor c, droplet impact experiments
on the tilting surface with α = 60° was conducted, as displayed
by the open markers in Figure 5b, suggesting that the model by Yeong et al. can be used to
describe the relationships among Dymax, Wen, and α in our experiments.
Finally, we obtained the maximum spreading diameter in the tangential
direction as Dymax = D0(0.79Wen0.29 + 0.0033 tan2 αWen).
In the lateral direction, the droplet maximum spreading is governed
by inertia, which is close to that on the horizontal impact and confirmed
in the previous research,30 following the
scaling of Dxmax ≈ Dmax ≈ 0.79D0Wen0.29. According to volume
conservation, the film thickness is determined as h = D03/6DxmaxDymax. Hence, the retraction time in the lateral direction is , where f is a function
of Wen and the inclination α, expressed
as f = (0.79 + 0.0033 tan2 αWen0.71)−0.5, which
decreases as Wen (5 < Wen < 70) and α (0 < α < 90°)
increase. Meanwhile, the model shows a good agreement with the experimental
data (Figure S1). Therefore, the contact
time is reduced on the inclined surfaces with a large Weber number
or a large inclination, as evidenced in Figure 3a. This might be explained by a much more
prominent asymmetric spreading at large Weber numbers or a large inclination,
which endows a fast retraction and a shortened contact time.

(Dmax*) as a function of normal Weber number (Wen) for a drop impacting on horizontal superhydrophobic
surfaces, where Dmax* is the ratio of the maximum spreading (Dmax) and the original drop diameter (D0). The curve is generated by regression fitting
of the experimental data. (b) Maximum spreading diameter in the tangential
direction as a function of α. The solid line is drawn using
the model from Yeong et al. The open markers are used to verify the
feasibility of the model (Wen = 5, 20,
37, 52, and 70 with fixed α = 60°). Dymax* is the nondimensionalized maximum spreading diameter in the tangential
direction as Dymax* = Dymax/D0.

Conclusions
In this study, we systematically
investigate the droplet impact
dynamics on inclined superhydrophobic surfaces. During impact, after
the drop spreads to its maximum extension in the lateral direction,
it continues to spread in the tangential direction. However, the drop
retraction in the lateral direction is much faster than that in the
tangential direction. At the end of retraction in the lateral direction,
the drop detaches from the surface directly in an asymmetric shape,
endowing a shortened contact time. We show that the contact time decreases
with the increase of impact velocity and inclining angle. A simple
theoretical model is constructed to explain this phenomenon. We envision
that the asymmetric bouncing on inclined surfaces not only extends
our fundamental understanding of drop impact dynamics but also provides
a reference for design superhydrophobic surfaces for various applications.
