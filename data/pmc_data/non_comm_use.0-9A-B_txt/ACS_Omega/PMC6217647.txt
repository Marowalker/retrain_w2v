Atrazine
is an herbicide that is widely used in crop production
at about 70 million pounds per year in the United States. Its widespread
use has led to contamination of groundwater and other aquatic systems.
It has resulted in many serious environmental and human health issues.
This study focuses on the identification and characterization of a
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamer that binds to atrazine. In this
study, a variation of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment (SELEX) process was used to identify an aptamer, which
binds to atrazine with high affinity and specificity. This SELEX focused
on inducing the aptamer’s ability to change conformation upon
binding to atrazine, and stringent negative target selections. After
12 rounds of in vitro selection, the ssDNA aptamer candidate R12.45
was chosen and truncated to obtain a 46-base sequence. The binding
affinity, specificity, and structural characteristics of this truncated
candidate was investigated by using isothermal titration calorimetry,
circular dichroism (CD) analysis, SYBR Green I (SG) fluorescence displacement
assays, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) colorimetric assays. The truncated
R12.45 candidate aptamer bound to atrazine with high affinity (Kd = 3.7 nM) and displayed low cross-binding
activities on structurally related herbicides. In addition, CD analysis
data indicated a target induced structural stabilization. Finally,
SG assays and AuNPs assays showed nonconventional binding activities
between the truncated R12.45 aptamer candidate and atrazine, which
warrants future studies.

==== Body
Introduction
Atrazine is an herbicide
that is widely used in crop production.
It is used to prevent the growth of broad-leafed weeds in both agricultural
and residential environments. Although the European Union has banned
atrazine since 2003, it is the second most widely used herbicide in
the United States with an average of over 70 million pounds of atrazine
being used per year.1 Atrazine’s
widespread use and persistence has led to the contamination of groundwater
and other aquatic systems.2 This contamination
disrupts hormones in animals and is linked to cancers and birth defects.2,3 Studies demonstrated that atrazine inhibits the production of testosterone
and induces the production of estrogen, thus chemically-castrating
many types of animals. Amphibians and fish are at the greatest risk
because of living in an aquatic system.3,4 This type of
endocrine disruption from atrazine has the potential to affect humans
and other mammals.3 The wide spectrum of
atrazine’s described detrimental effects has led to the investigation
of low-cost, reversible novel binding elements specific to atrazine
for rapid biosensing applications.5−7

Aptamers are nucleic
acid-based molecular recognition elements
that were first described independently by the Gold group and the
Szostak group.8,9 These functional single-stranded
nucleic acids can fold into 3-dimensional conformations, and bind
to user-defined target molecules with very high affinity and specificity.
Aptamers are identified through an iterative in vitro selection process,
termed, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment
(SELEX). This process involves repeated incubation of a large random
oligonucleotide library (∼1015) with the user defined
target, partitioning between the target-bound and nonbound library
molecules, and amplification.10 Previously,
there were two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers identified to
target atrazine.6,7 Sanchez described using capillary
electrophoresis-based SELEX (CE-SELEX) to identify a ssDNA aptamer
specific for atrazine with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 890 nM.6 Williams et
al. also identified a ssDNA aptamer that binds to atrazine using a
variation of the SELEX process heavily emphasized on directing the
library molecules away from binding to nondesired targets or negative
targets.7 The selected aptamer had a Kd reported in the subnanomolar range and high
specificity toward atrazine.

ssDNA aptamers have been extensively
investigated in biosensing
applications because of their low-cost and reversible denaturation.11,12 Aptamers with conformational changes upon target binding and recognition
have even higher value in biosensor integration.10 Different SELEX variants have been developed to intentionally
identify aptamers with target-induced conformational change properties,
such as GO-SELEX and Capture-SELEX.13,14 Although both
previously reported atrazine binding aptamers were identified with
respectable affinity and specificity, it is unknown if there is a
target-induced conformational change present in either reported full
length aptamers. The aim of this study was to adopt a previously described
Capture-SELEX protocol in order to identify a ssDNA aptamer specific
for atrazine that would have a target-induced conformational change.15,16 The ssDNA oligonucleotide library utilized in this study has been
successfully screened for multiple aptamers bound to small molecules
and protein targets.7,17−22

At the conclusion of this study, a truncated ssDNA aptamer
with
high affinity and specificity for atrazine was identified using a
modified Capture-SELEX protocol in combination with a stringent negative
selection scheme (Decoy-SELEX). Structural studies revealed target-induced
conformational stabilization that was not demonstrated in previously
reported atrazine binding aptamers. In addition, this study demonstrated
the generalization of the Capture-SELEX protocols to a ssDNA oligonucleotide
library that was not specifically designed for the Capture-SELEX protocol.

Results
and Discussion
Twelve rounds of SELEX were performed to identify
a ssDNA aptamer
which targets atrazine (Table 1). Detailed protocols can be found in the Experimental Section. In brief, the random ssDNA oligonucleotide
library was captured on cDNA probe-coated magnetic beads. Atrazine
was introduced to the system to induce the release of library molecules
from the cDNA probe. The solution containing atrazine-bound library
molecules was partitioned by magnets, and subsequently amplified by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ssDNA molecules were retrieved before
being subjected to another round of in vitro selection (Figure 1). Twenty five, thirty two,
thirty, and forty six of post round 3, 6, 9, and 12 library clones
were sequenced and analyzed for consensus sequence family, respectively.
Sequences obtained from post round 12 selection were analyzed by Mfold
for secondary structures and Gibbs free energy values (ΔG).23 One candidate sequence,
designated R12.45 was highly conserved in multiple sequence families
after alignment analysis (Figure 2). Mfold predicted that the secondary structure of
the 5′ constant region of R12.45 to be partially hybridizing
with the random region of the sequence. The first 10 bases of the
oligonucleotide library were captured on probe cDNA before atrazine
was introduced in the system, which suggests the target induced dehybridization
of the single-stranded oligonucleotide from the cDNA (Figure 3a). The predicted secondary
structure contained one long hairpin structure comprised with partial
5′ constant region and approximately 74% of the random region,
and a small second hairpin comprised with 12% of the random region
and partial 3′ constant region (ΔG =
−5.62 kcal/mol). It has been reported that the constant region
can also participate in binding events, and therefore may be included
in candidate aptamer sequence analysis.24−28 Because of the cost and efficiency of oligonucleotide
chemical synthesis, R12.45 candidate sequence was truncated into a
46-base long hairpin structure for binding and structural characterization
(ΔG = −4.22 kcal/mol) (Figure 3b).

Figure 1 (a) Illustration of the
systematic evolution of ligand by exponential
enrichment process. Library molecules that bind to negative targets
(undesired targets) are washed away, and those that bind to the positive
target (atrazine in this study) are retrieved and amplified by PCR.
This completes one round of SELEX. (b) Illustration of the library

The binding
affinity between the truncated R12.45 (R12.45 Trunc.)
and atrazine was measured by automatic isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC, MicroCal Auto-iTC200 by GE). Three independent assays were performed
to optimize the binding conditions. Two hundred microliter of 50 μM
atrazine was titrated into four hundred microliter of 10 μM
12.45 Trunc. candidate aptamer in the sample cell at 25 °C, and
the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was estimated to be 3.7 nM based on nonlinear regression model
analysis by companion software, where n-value was
fitted as a variable (Figure 4, Table S1). The quality of data
obtained from ITC experiments can be described by the Wiseman coefficient c = n × [aptamer]/Kd, where n represents the number of binding
site. It was reported that c values range from 1
to 1000 were needed to reflect reliable ITC data.29 It is to be noted that an n-value of less
than 1 suggests multiple binding positions may be present on the ligand.30 The reported ITC data had a calculated c value of 162, where the molar ratio between macromolecule
(aptamer) and ligand (atrazine) was 1:5. In contrast to another experiment
performed with a molar ratio of 1:10, where the c value was less than 1 (3.9 × 10–5), the current
data and the experimental setup suggested its validity. At the given
atrazine concentration (50 μM), the binding between the aptamer
candidate and the ligand was complete. It is important to be noted
that while the concentration of the ligand may be increased to enhance
the heat response, the molar ratio must be maintained. However, it
has been reported that increased aptamer concentration may lead to
increased Kd resulting from interaptamer
interaction.31 Therefore, the concentration
of both the aptamer and atrazine utilized were optimal for this experiment.

Figure 4 ITC analysis
of binding affinity between R12.45 Trunc. candidate
aptamer and its target, atrazine.

The Kd value determined in this
study
was consistent with other published small molecule binding ssDNA aptamers.32−34 The selection stringency or pressure was increased by (1) lengthening
the cDNA probe bases, thus, increasing the difficulty for breaking
the hybridization force, (2) decreasing the incubation time and concentrations
of atrazine, thus, only the library molecules that bind to atrazine
in a quick and strong fashion would be retrieved. This adopted selection
strategy validated previously published selection schemes (Decoy-SELEX).19,20

The specificity of the R12.45 Trunc. was characterized by
using
SYBR Green I (SG) fluorescence displacement assay as previously described.35 SG is a green fluorescence dye specific for
double-stranded DNA by means of DNA intercalation. The dye itself
does not have a fluorescence signal and is commonly used in reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for template amplification monitoring.
The assay principle was based upon the binding of target molecules
to the aptamer, and the displacement of intercalated SG dyes from
partially hybridized regions, thus decreasing the fluorescence signal.
However, multiple assays result showed the binding of atrazine to
R12.45 Trunc. candidate aptamer produced higher fluorescence signal
in the presence of SG when compared to control samples without atrazine.
The cross-binding activity of R12.45 Trunc. on negative targets used
in the selection were assayed with the same experimental set up (Table 2). Interestingly,
the normalized average fluorescence signal of all negative targets
binding to R12.45 Trunc. was lower than the signal recovered from
binding to atrazine. This result was contradictory to the assay principle
described in the literature.35,36 In order to investigate
this phenomenon further, varying concentration of atrazine (1 nM to
1 μM) were tested in a SG standard assay. A trend of increasing
fluorescence signal at low concentrations of atrazine followed by
a decrease in the fluorescence signal at high concentrations of atrazine
was observed in multiple repeated assays (Figure S1). The same experimental setup was also subjected to a melting
experiment with the use of a real-time PCR system (StepOnePlus by
Thermo Scientific). Normalized fluorescence signals at low concentrations
of atrazine were higher than signals of the buffer control (Figure S2). This trend continued as the temperature
increased. The trend of the fluorescence signals of atrazine led to
our hypothesis that the binding of atrazine at low concentration initially
stabilizes the secondary structures of R12.45 Trunc., thus, leading
to increased amount of SG intercalation, and higher levels of the
fluorescence signal. In addition, it suggested that SG was starting
to be displaced when atrazine was in excess. It is to be noted that
the fluorescence signal recovered from cyanazine addition was lower
than the buffer control, which suggested the nonspecific interaction
between R12.45 Trunc. and cyanazine was different than the interaction
with other negative targets. This was likely due to the presence of
a cyano functional group, and a relatively larger degree of structural
differences when compared to other triazine herbicides (Figure S3).

R12.45 Trunc. to cyanazine, and therefore a very large selectivity

Circular dichroism
(CD) analysis was performed to further study
the secondary structure in R12.45 Trunc. candidate aptamer upon atrazine
binding (Figure 5).
The CD spectra showed a characteristic negative band at around 245
nm, and a positive band at around 270 nm. This confirmed R12.45 Trunc.
assumed a B-form DNA structure.37 The CD
amplitude of R12.45 Trunc. was reduced upon the addition of atrazine.
Although the global conformation of the aptamer did not change, the
reduction in amplitude indicated a transition of a B-form duplex,
to a hairpin.38 Previous study reported
hairpin, bulges and stem-loop structures in aptamers are responsible
for target binding.39 As mentioned previously,
the ΔG value of R12.45 Trunc. was −4.22
kcal/mol, which indicates a relatively less stable structure when
compared to the full length R12.45. The CD spectra changes suggested
the binding of atrazine stabilized the overall secondary structure
via the hairpin position, while maintaining the global B-form DNA
conformation.

absent of atrazine (ATZ: atrazine).

Gold nanoparticle (AuNP) colorimetric assay has been commonly
utilized
as a rapid detection platform for aptamer–target binding.36,40 In brief, the assay principle relies on the pink-red to blue-purple
shift in localized surface plasmon resonance observed in AuNPs aggregation.
Multiple studies showed ssDNA aptamers coated AuNPs resisted salt
induced aggregation, the blue-purple color shift was not observed.
Upon the addition of the target, ssDNA aptamer detached from AuNPs,
the salt induced blue-purple color shift was observed. This change
in color could be quantified with absorbance measurement at 520 and
650 nm. A previously reported AuNPs colorimetric assay protocol was
adopted to further investigate the binding characteristics between
R12.45 Trunc. and atrazine.36 Cyanazine
was chosen as the negative control based on the result obtained from
the SG fluorescence displacement assay. Unexpectedly, there was no
salt induced AuNPs aggregation observed when different concentrations
(as high as 100 μM) of atrazine were added to the aptamer coated
AuNPs (Figure 6). On
the other hand, a statistically significant aggregation was observed
when 100 μM of cyanazine was added to the same system. This
observation was again contradicted with the majority of literature.36,40,41 However, two previous studies
showed similar AuNPs aggregation patterns observed in this current
study.42,43 Chavez et al. reported an AuNPs colorimetric
detection assay utilizing the riboflavin binding aptamer (RBA).43 The study showed the addition of riboflavin
to RBA coated AuNPs increased RBA stability on AuNPs surfaces. When
salt was added to the system, no aggregation was observed. On the
other hand, when a nontarget small molecule, 2-quinoxaline carboxylic
acid was added to the system, a blue-purple color shift was observed
after salt addition. Smith et al. additionally investigated AuNPs
colorimetric detection assay utilizing two different cocaine binding
aptamers, MN4 and MN6.42 MN4 was a known
aptamer for cocaine with no conformational change upon target recognition.
MN6 on the other hand, displayed a conformational change upon cocaine
binding. It was reported that MN6 coated AuNPs remained in the nonaggregated
state upon cocaine and salt addition. This was because of target-induced
structural stabilization. The AuNPs colorimetric assay in this study
demonstrated a result similar to the previous two studies. This also
supports our hypothesis generated during our SG fluorescence displacement
assay, in that, binding of atrazine to R12.45 Trunc. stabilizes the
secondary structure of the aptamer, and thus supported the contradictory
result from the fluorescence displacement assay.

image of the samples represented in (a).

There are two previously reported atrazine binding aptamers.6,7 At-Apt-25 aptamer, identified by Sanchez did not have statistically
significant selectivity between atrazine and simazine, a trizaine
herbicide which differs only by one methyl group.6 R12.45 Trunc. displayed similar selectivity between atrazine
and simazine when compared to the aptamer (R12.23) identified by Williams
et al. study.7 Upon comparing previously
published atrazine binding aptamer sequences (Figure S4), there are higher similarities between the truncated
R12.23 and R12.45 Trunc. after alignment near the center of R12.45
Trunc than between At-Apt-25. This suggests high affinity atrazine
binding to ssDNA aptamer may be conserved within a few nucleotides.
Notably, that this study utilized the same ssDNA oligonucleotide library
design (RMWN34) as Williams et al. This library was first designed
for general SELEX methodology. The current study showed the success
of adopting a Capture-SELEX protocol to an existent library without
any sequence modifications. This has validated the robustness of the
Capture-SELEX protocol previously described and that it may be generalized
to other oligonucleotide libraries.15,16 Williams et
al. utilized target immobilized magnetic bead based in vitro selection,
which did not have specific selection conditions for screening aptamers
with target induced conformational change or structural stabilization.
It is generally agreed in the aptamer research field that it is particularly
more challenging to identify aptamers specific for small molecules
than for proteins.44,45 This is largely because of the
less binding motifs on small molecules. It is interesting to see the
different SELEX strategies can be utilized on the same oligonucleotide
library, and ultimately identify two different aptamers that bind
to the same small molecule target.

Conclusions
This
study identified a new ssDNA aptamer that binds to atrazine
with high affinity and specificity. These are attractive features
for future biosensor development. It also revealed nonconventional
binding characteristics of R12.45 Trunc. aptamer. This phenomenon
warrants further studies involving characterization comparison between
the R12.23 and R12.45 Trunc. It is known that the predicted stability
of the R12.23 is higher than that of R12.45 Trunc. One pervious study
showed the truncated R12.23 aptamer (34-mer) did not assume conformational
change upon atrazine binding.46 The potential
different binding characteristics are currently under investigation
by our group.

Experimental Section
In Vitro Selection for
Atrazine-Specific ssDNA Aptamer
In brief, the ssDNA oligonucleotide
library utilized in this study
was previously designed by the Sooter Laboratory at WVU, and termed
RMWN34.7 The DNA library was commercially
synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies with PAGE purification. NanoLink
streptavidin magnetic bead was also purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies.
The primer sequences were purchased from Eurofins Genomics with desalt
purification. The cDNA capture probes were purchased from IDT with
desalt purification. Sequences are shown below.

Atrazine, simazine, propazine, terbuthylazine, and cyanazine were
all purchased from Sigma with analytical standards.

The selection
process was adopted from previously described protocols.15,16 In brief, 60 μL of streptavidin coated magnetic beads suspended
in selection buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) were incubated with 3.6 μL of 1 M biotinylated
cDNA probe for 30 min at room temperature. After the incubation, the
bead suspension was washed with the selection buffer for three times
to the remove nonspecifically adhered cDNA probe. Approximately 1015 copies of ssDNA from the library dissolved in selection
buffer was first denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, then snapped cool
to 4 °C, and, finally, equilibrated to room temperature. The
library was serially added to 20 μL of cDNA coated magnetic
beads for a total of 3 times. The final prepared library captured
magnetic beads were washed in selection buffer for 3 times to remove
nonspecifically adhered library molecules. UV measurement (NanoDrop
ND-2000c spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific) was utilized to monitor
the library capturing efficiency. The library preparation was performed
immediately before each round of selection. The melting temperatures
between all cDNA probes and the library in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ (selection buffer condition) were first estimated with free
software (Promega). It was estimated that probe lengths from eight
to ten were suitable for aneling and dehybridizing at around room
temperatures. The cDNA probe length increased as the selection progress
to raise selection pressure (Table 1).

During rounds 1–3, incubation of the
library with only atrazine
was performed for a predetermined amount of time (Table 1). The target bound, and unbound
sequences were partitioned using the magnet. The bound portion of
the library was retained. Starting from round 4 on, negative targets
were introduced before atrazine incubation (Table 1). The negative target bound portion of the
library was extracted and discarded, and the remaining library was
incubated with atrazine. Once the incubation with atrazine was completed,
the bound sequences were retrieved for the next step. All herbicides
used in the study were dissolved in 10% methanol-selection buffer
due to low water solubility. All selection steps were performed at
room temperature. The multiple negative targets selection scheme was
adopted from previously described Decoy-SELEX.19,20

After each round of the selection, the solution containing
the
atrazine bound library molecules was first dialyzed with a 2k MWCO
dialysis device (Thermo Scientific) to remove excess atrazine in the
solution. The remaining solution containing the atrazine bound ssDNA
molecules were subjected to PCR. The PCR mixture conditions and thermal
cycling conditions were prepared identically as previously described.7 The PCR product was purified with IBI purification
kit (IBI Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
At least 1013 copies of amplified dsDNA were obtained with
large scale PCR (4–5 mL). Purified dsDNA was subjected to single
strand separation and ethanol precipitation to retrieve the forward
strand DNA exactly as previously described.7

Cloning and Sequencing of the Atrazine-Binding ssDNA Aptamer
In brief, the ssDNA oligonucleotide library of post rounds 3, 6,
9, and 12 were cloned into TOP10 competent cells (Thermo Scientific),
and plasmid DNA was extracted as previously described. The plasmid
DNA was sequenced by Eurofins Genomics. The truncated candidate aptamer
sequence, R12.45 Trunc. was commercially synthesized by Eurofins Genomics
with PAGE purification.

SG Fluorescence Displacement Assay
In brief, the assay
was performed as previously described with slight modifications.35 R12.45 Trunc. at 10 μM was prepared in
10% methanol selection buffer (10% v/v methanol, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris-HCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). It was then denatured
at 95 °C for 5 min, then snapped cool to 4 °C, and finally
equilibrated to room temperature. Four microliter of 1 × SG was
mixed with 10 μM of aptamer solution at 1 to 1 ratio. Atrazine
concentration was prepared from 1 nM to 1 μM in the same selection
buffer. Atrazine and SG-aptamer mixture were mixed to have a final
volume of 125 μL. Samples were prepared in duplicate. Negative
controls were atrazine alone and atrazine with SG and buffer with
SG-aptamer. All samples were placed in a black 96-well microplate
and fluorescence signal was measured in a FLx800 microplate reader
(Biotek) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 520 nm. All fluorescence
readings were normalized with ((F – F0)/F0), where F0 was the fluorescence reading from the buffer
control. Three independent assays were performed as described. The
same experimental setup was also utilized in RT-PCR melting experiment.

To determine the specificity of R12.45 Trunc. A similar experiment
was performed, where all herbicides used in the selection were prepared
at 1 μM. Samples were prepared in duplicates with three independent
assays performed. Representative results were presented. Data was
averaged and the standard deviation was calculated. The statistical
significant difference of the means (p < 0.05)
was determined with the one-tailed student t-test.

CD Studies
A JASCO J-1500 CD spectrophotometer (JASCO)
was used to study the binding characteristic between R12.45 Trunc.
and atrazine. The 10% methanol selection buffer was first scanned
for three times with a wavelength range from 210 to 310 nm at 50 nm/min
scanning speed, in a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette. The spectra
was averaged and subtracted from the actual sample scans. The solution
of 10 μM R12.45 Trunc. in the identical buffer was scanned with
the exact same parameter, and served as reference. Lastly, the solution
of 10 μM aptamer and 10 μM atrazine were also scanned
to compare. All spectral data was averaged and analyzed with the spectra
manager software from the manufacturer.

AuNPs Colorimetric Assay
The AuNPs were purchased from
Nano Composix. Manufacturer specification sheet indicated an average
particle diameter of 9.8 ± 0.8 nm at 9.5 nM particle concentration.
The assay was performed as previously described. In brief, 6 μL
of R12.45 Trunc. at 10 μM in 10% methanol water and 135 μL
of AuNPs from the stock were incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Targets (atrazine and cyanazine) at varying concentrations (100 nM
to 100 μM, 10% methanol water) in 243 μL total volume
were added to the aptamer–gold mixture and incubated for 30
min at room temperature. Lastly, 6 μL of 1 M sodium chloride
solution was added to each mixture for 5 min. The aggregation pattern
was observed by naked eye, and in addition transferred to a clear
96-well plate for digital imaging, and absorbance scan at 520 and
650 nm with a μQuant plate reader (Biotek). Samples were prepared
in duplicate. Three successful independent assays were performed.
Representative data was averaged and standard deviation was calculated.
Statistical significant difference of the means (p < 0.05) was determined with the one-tailed student t-test.
