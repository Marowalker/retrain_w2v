A phenotypic whole cell high-throughput
screen against the asexual
blood and liver stages of the malaria parasite identified a benzimidazole
chemical series. Among the hits were the antiemetic benzimidazole
drug Lerisetron 1 (IC50 NF54 = 0.81 μM)
and its methyl-substituted analogue 2 (IC50 NF54 = 0.098 μM). A medicinal chemistry hit to lead effort
led to the identification of chloro-substituted analogue 3 with high potency against the drug-sensitive NF54 (IC50 NF54 = 0.062 μM) and multidrug-resistant K1 (IC50 K1 = 0.054 μM) strains of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Compounds 2 and 3 gratifyingly showed in vivo efficacy in both Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum mouse models of malaria. Cardiotoxicity risk as expressed in strong
inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium
channel was identified as a major liability to address. This led to
the synthesis and biological assessment of around 60 analogues from
which several compounds with improved antiplasmodial potency, relative
to the lead compound 3, were identified.

Introduction
Malaria, caused by
the Plasmodium parasite genus
and transmitted to humans by the bite of Plasmodium-infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a
life-threatening disease.1 Among the five
species of Plasmodium parasites (Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium
vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium knowlesi) that cause malaria in humans, P. falciparum is the most serious and often leads
to death.2 A milder form of malaria is
initiated in humans by P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae and less frequently by P. knowlesi.3 According to the 2018 World Malaria
Report, globally, approximately 219 million malaria cases and about
435 000 deaths were reported in 2017.4 On the basis of the figures published by the Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and World Health Organization (WHO),
90% of reported deaths caused by malaria occur in sub-Saharan Africa.5 Worldwide, children under 5 years of age are
the most vulnerable age group and accounted for 61% of the total malaria
deaths in 2017.4,5 Malaria can be prevented by the
use of indoor insecticide sprays and mosquito nets and avoiding the
accumulation of stagnant water in the house or treatment using improved
antimalarial medications.

Among the various antimalarial medications
used for the treatment
of malaria, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been
found to be the most effective, especially against P. falciparum and have allowed millions of patients
to be cured over the last few decades.6 Unfortunately, the emerging resistance to all existing antimalarials
has become a recurring challenge for the goal of malaria eradication.7 In 2008, delayed parasite clearance by ACTs,
which hinted at the emergence of resistance, were reported in patients
from the eastern Thai-Cambodian border.8 Hence, there is a critical and urgent need to develop novel and
affordable antimalarial therapeutic agents to tackle this rising problem.

Compounds possessing a benzimidazole core possess a broad spectrum
of biological activities,9 including antimalarial
activity10 (Figure 1). This scaffold is present in astemizole
(brand name Hismanal), a second-generation antihistamine drug and
antimalarial lead that was withdrawn from the market in most countries
because of rare but potentially fatal side effects, such as QTc interval
prolongation and related arrhythmias due to human ether-a-go-go related
gene (hERG) channel blockade.11 Nor-astemizole
is an active metabolite of astemizole with supposedly lower cardiac
risks.12 Lerisetron, a related benzimidazole
derivative, is an effective antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor
and was used in clinical trials as a highly potent antiemetic drug.13 Very few reports are available in the literature
regarding efforts toward improving the off-target activity (hERG)
of Astemizole and Lerisetron derivatives.14

Figure 1 Pharmacologically
active molecules containing the benzimidazole
structure.

Herein, we disclose the synthesis,
structure–activity relationship
(SAR), and biological assessment of a series of benzimidazole derivatives
based on the lead compound 3. The in vivo pharmacokinetic
(PK) and efficacy studies on compound 3 are also described.

SAR Strategy
(1) A broad
range of cyclic and acyclic
amines as the Eastern Substituent were introduced. To mitigate the
hERG liability, nonbasic substituents or amines where the basicity
of the amine is modulated, as well as bulky substituents or linear
side chains plus carbon-linked ring systems were introduced.

(2) Benzimidazole core replacements
exemplified
by incorporation of a variety of substituted aryl or heteroaryl rings
instead of the Cl-phenyl group as the Western Substituent, were pursued.

(3) In the Southern Substituent,
the effect
of benzyl group replacement using different carbon linkers or replacement
of the phenyl moiety with heteroaryl or saturated systems was investigated.



The overall goal of
the initial
investigation was to identify an early lead compound suitable for
a lead optimization campaign by addressing identified liabilities.
In this regard, we aimed to mitigate the hERG liability of the series
(ideally >10 μM, or at least a 100-fold safety index over
asexual
blood stage antiplasmodium activity) while retaining the excellent
druglike properties and maintaining or improving Pf potency.

Chemistry
The 1,2,5-trisubstituted
benzimidazoles were
synthesized using a literature protocol, which leads to the final
target compounds in five consecutive steps as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 General Synthetic
Approach to the Synthesis of 2-Amino Benzimidazole
Derivatives
Reagents and conditions: (a)
Et3N, acetonitrile (ACN), 50 °C, 16 h (56–97%)
or K2CO3, dimethylformamide (DMF), 80 °C,
4–18 h (25–98%) or K2CO3, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), 120 °C, 24 h, (93%); (b) Pt/C, H2 balloon, RT, MeOH, 8 h to 3 days (88–97%) or Fe powder, sat.
aqu. NH4Cl, EtOH, 90 °C, 6–18 h (69–97%)
or NH2NH2·H2O, MeOH, 80 °C,
2 h (61%); (c) triphosgene, dichloromethane (DCM), 25 °C, 16
h (68–94%); (d) POCl3, HCl, 150 °C, 4–24
h, (44–51%) or POCl3, PCl5, 110 °C,
1 h (45%); (e) CH(OMe)3, HCOOH, 100 °C 1–2
h (30–85%) or CH(OEt)3, para-toluene
sulfonic acid (PTSA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), reflux, 2 h (88%); (f)
lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), Cl3C–CCl3, THF, −78 °C, 4–5 h (33–96%) or LDA, CBr4, THF, −78 °C, 3 4 h (41%); (g) R3R4NH, Et3N, t-BuOH, 120 °C,
6 h to 18 days (9–91%).

The first step
involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction
(SNAr) between suitable amines, o-halo-nitro
compounds 6, and an additional base [K2CO3 or Et3N] at elevated temperatures to obtain an
amino-nitro intermediate 7,15 followed by a reduction step [Pt/C and H216 or iron powder and NH4Cl17 or hydrazine hydrate18] to afford diamines 8. The cyclization of 8 to the 1,3-dihydro-2H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-one 9 was carried out with triphosgene19 or with trimethyl orthoformate/HCOOH or triethyl orthoformate/PTSA
to access benzimidazole intermediate 11.20 Transformation to the 2-halogen derivatives was performed
on 9 using POCl3 and HCl or PCl5 to yield 10.21 Unfortunately,
this reaction did not work well for some substrates. Alternatively,
deprotonation of the benzimidazole 11 using lithium diisopropylamide
(LDA) followed by subsequent halogenation with Cl3C–CCl3 or CBr4 yielded 12.22 The desired halogenated derivatives 12 were
cleanly isolated and in high yield albeit initially an undesired side
product 13 was observed when more than 1 equiv of LDA
was used. Interestingly, double deprotonation/halogenation opened
the door to cleanly attach additional halogen atoms to the benzene
ring in position 4. These derivatives were further used for the attachment
of aromatic rings via Pd-mediated coupling with boronic acids.23 The halogenated compounds 10, 12, and 13 were subjected to amination reactions
using a broad range of amines in t-BuOH and triethylamine
to access the corresponding final products 14–15 and 16–42 in good yields.

Furthermore, compound 43 were synthesized following
a sodium triacetoxyborohydride-mediated reductive amination protocol
(Scheme 2),24 which was carried out by the treatment of the
amine 33 and a variety of aldehydes. The corresponding
products (43) were obtained in generally low yields (16–49%).

Scheme 2 General Synthetic Route for the 2-Amino Benzimidazole Analogues (43)
Reaction and conditions: (a)
R5-CHO, Na(OAc)3BH, AcOH, DCM, 20–27
°C, 2–24 h (16–49%).

Carbon-linked
benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized as depicted
in Scheme 3. The amide
coupling between 44 and 8 was accomplished
via the treatment with 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate
(HATU) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (DIPEA) to yield amides 45.25 Ring closure and Boc-deprotection
of 45 were accomplished in acetic acid when heated to
100 °C in a sealed tube. The resulting C-linked benzimidazoles 46 were isolated in low to good yields.26

Scheme 3 General Synthetic Route for the C-Linked Benzimidazoles 46
Reagents and conditions: (a)
HATU, DIPEA, DMF, 35 °C, 16 h (39–94%); (b) AcOH, 100
°C, 6 h (28–71%).

2-Amino benzimidazole
derivatives 49 and 52 were synthesized by
a Suzuki coupling reaction23 between the
bromo compounds 47 or 50 with the appropriate
aryl boronic acids, followed by Boc-deprotection
using 4 N HCl in 1,4-dioxane in low to moderate yields (Scheme 4i,ii).

Scheme 4 General Synthetic
Route for the Synthesis of 5-Substituted (49) and 4,5-Disubstituted
2-Amino Benzimidazoles (52)
Reaction and conditions:
(a)
R10-B(OH)2, Cs2CO3, Pd(dppf)Cl2, 1,4-dioxane/H2O (4:1), 95 °C, 4–24
h (45-97%); (b) 4 N HCl in 1,4-dioxane, 2–4 h, 20–27
°C (15–76%); for 49ea; R10 = 4-Py;
EtOAc, neutralized with sat. NaHCO3 solution, 20 °C,
3 h (50%).

The incorporation of a nitrogen
atom into the phenyl ring was carried
out by selecting an appropriate commercially available chloropyridine
isomer 53a and 53b (Scheme 5). Using an identical protocol carried out
as mentioned earlier in the Scheme 1, the reaction between 53 with benzylamine
yielded the desired amino-nitro products 54. These compounds
(54) were subsequently reduced via catalytic hydrogenation
with platinum on carbon and hydrogen to furnish diamino derivatives
followed by the cyclization with trimethyl orthoformate and formic
acid at elevated temperatures to access imidazopyridines 55 in low to good yields in a one-pot reaction. Deprotonation of Imidazopyridines 55 was realized with in situ generated LDA followed by treatment
with hexachloroethane to afford chloro-imidazopyridines 56 in 91 and 37% yields, respectively. The chloro compounds 56, piperazine, and Et3N in t-BuOH were
heated to 120 °C in a pressure tube to yield the desired products 57.

Scheme 5 Synthetic Route for the Synthesis of Imidazopyridines
(57)
Reagents and conditions: (a)
(i) Bn-NH2, K2CO3, DMF, 80 °C,
3–4 h, quantitative; (b) (i) Pt/C, H2 balloon, 20
°C, MeOH, 2–3 h; (ii) CH(OMe)3, HCOOH, 100
°C, 1–2 h (30–82%); (c) LDA, Cl3C–CCl3, THF, −78 °C, 4 h (37–91%); (d) piperazine,
Et3N, t-BuOH, 120 °C, 18 h (25–80%).

Results and Discussion
In Vitro Antiplasmodium
Activity, Solubility, and Cytotoxicity
All of the synthesized
compounds were evaluated for in vitro antiplasmodium
activity against the drug-sensitive strain (NF54) of P. falciparum. Compounds with PfNF54 <0.400 μM were also evaluated against a multidrug-resistant
strain (K1) using chloroquine and artesunate as the reference drugs.
Selected compounds were also assessed for cytotoxicity in a Chinese
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line using emetine as a reference drug. Aqueous
solubility was determined at pH 2.0 and 6.5. Additionally, selected
compounds were further tested for their activity against the hERG
channel and in vitro microsomal metabolic stability was assessed as
a percentage of the test compound remaining after 30 min.

SAR of the
Eastern Substituent
On the basis of the
literature precedence, hERG inhibition liabilities can be drastically
reduced by the removal of polar/basic moieties (e.g., reduction of
the basicity of amines),27 formation of
zwitterions (e.g., introduction of −COOH groups),28 disrupting the π–π interaction
(e.g., replacing electron-donating groups with electron-withdrawing
groups and introducing steric hindrance),29 and by discrete structural modifications (e.g., imparting rigidity).30 On the basis of the aforementioned strategies,
we began exploring the Eastern Substituent by replacing the basic
piperazine moiety with nonbasic ones, or replacing it with a variety
of basic cyclic/bicyclic amines or introducing open-chain amines (2-,
3- or 4-carbon linkers) or adding acidic groups. For the investigation
of the Eastern Substituent, we left the Western Substituent (phenyl
with 5-chloro substituent) and the Southern Substituent (benzyl) unchanged,
to have matched pairs for comparison.

A broad range of 2-amino
benzimidazoles were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro Pf activity, solubility, CHO cytotoxicity for comparison
with 3 (Table 1), and for activity on the hERG channel. The morpholine derivative 16a displayed a noteworthy drop-in potency with an IC50 value of >1 μM (NF54) compared with 3. The piperazine derivatives 17 and 18 containing
a nonbasic nitrogen also showed a substantial loss of antiplasmodium
activity, demonstrating the importance of a basic nitrogen in the
Eastern side chain. Compound 20, with a zwitterionic
character, was inactive, whereas the related nitrile derivative 19 retained reduced activity, presumably due to the reduced
basicity of the piperazine nitrogen. In a publication from the University
of Helsinki and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Tres Cantos,31 a compound similar to 21 but without the Southern
Substituent benzyl group was reported as being active; however, our
derivative 21 proved to be completely inactive. Examples 22 and 24 without a benzyl group were resynthesized
since they had been reported as active (185 and 66 nM); however, in
our assays, these compounds were completely inactive. The follow-on
derivatives containing a Bn-group (23 and 25) were also completely inactive in our assays. We also resynthesized
the literature compound 26,32 which was at least weakly active in our assays despite having no
basic nitrogen in the Eastern substituent. We did not pursue this
approach any further, since the compounds without a basic nitrogen
did not show improved hERG activity profiles (see the discussion later
on and the data in Table 7). It is clear from Table 1 that incorporating a nonbasic Eastern substituent
led to a considerable drop in the in vitro Pf activity
for the above-mentioned compounds, demonstrating the importance of
a basic nitrogen for antiplasmodium activity.

et al.33 ND = not determined.

When compounds with a basic nitrogen
in the Eastern substituent
are compared against each other (Table 2), additional methyl groups on the ring were detrimental
to activity (27) but connecting the Eastern substituent
via a carbon linker results in the retention or improvement of potency
(46a). A potency improvement was seen with the piperidine-4-amine
side chain (28) where the basic nitrogen was moved slightly
away from the benzimidazole core, leading to a 3-fold boost in potency.
Consistent with this observation was the 2-fold shift in activity
for the bicyclic Eastern substituent in 29 both for NF54
and K1.

We next investigated
the effect of open-chain analogues on antiplasmodium
activity. Opening the piperazine ring to the ethylenediamine derivative 33 led to a 4-fold drop-in potency. However, we did see an
improvement relating to the hERG activity of the compound, which will
be discussed later. Potency dropped even further in the case of the
related butanediamine (30) and propanediamine (32) derivatives. Methylation of the nitrogen (34) or dimethylation (35) resulted in nearly equipotent
derivatives. Incorporation of two benzyl groups (43a)
on the terminal nitrogen proved to be detrimental to activity. However,
the compound with a single benzyl group on the terminal nitrogen (43b) displayed reasonably good activity, which was comparable
to that of 3. Replacement of the phenyl group of 43b with a pyridyl or CF3-phenyl (43c and 43d) was not successful. When the terminal nitrogen
was incorporated into a ring system (36–38), compounds were found to be less active. Overall, acyclic
derivatives on the eastern end were less potent than their cyclic
counterparts. Selected, potent compounds (IC50 NF54 <
0.400 μM) were screened against a multidrug-resistant strain
(K1) to determine if these compounds are still effective against a
resistant strain. All derivatives tested were also active against
K1 within a twofold window, except for 38 (4-fold difference).
In general, most of the analogues showed good solubility across both
acidic (pH = 2) and neutral (pH = 6.5) conditions, with few exceptions.
This active set of compounds (NF54 <0.400 μM) was also screened
in a cytotoxicity assay using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells.
The most potent compounds had a good safety window (SI = CHO CC50/NF54 IC50 > 500), except for compound 43b (SI < 35-fold). Overall, in vitro cytotoxicity was
in general
not a concern for the series.

SAR of the Western Substituent
For the investigation
of the Western substituent, Eastern substituents that gave active
compounds based on the known derivatives (piperazine, piperidine,
and diaminopropane) were chosen. The Southern substituent (benzyl)
was left unchanged to have matched pairs for comparison (Table 3).

In a series
of compounds where the Eastern substituent is piperazinyl,
the switch from a 5-methyl substituent (2) to 5-Cl (3) or 5-Br (16b) led to a ∼2-fold improvement
in potency, whereas a 5-CF3 substituent (14c) led to a ∼3-fold loss of potency and a reduced safety index.
As mentioned earlier, introducing steric hindrance on the core is
a hERG mitigation strategy. Aromatic/heteroaromatic substituents were
introduced in the 5-position (49a–d and 49ea), via coupling of the bromo derivative with
the respective boronic acid derivatives. The consequence was a 25-fold
or greater loss in potency. In a series of compounds where the Eastern
substituent is piperidinyl, the 5-Cl (46a) and 5-Br (46b) derivatives picked up some potency in comparison to the
piperazine derivatives in the NF54 assay but were equally potent in
the K1 assay. There was a ∼4-fold drop-in activity for the
corresponding 5-CF3 (46c) derivative, whereas
an ester (46d) or sulfone (46e) substituent
in the 5-position led to inactive compounds. In a series of compounds
wherein the Eastern substituent is diaminopropyl, this trend was confirmed
where the chloro and bromo derivatives are equipotent but a 5–6-fold
drop-in potency was observed for the corresponding 5-CF3 substituent while there was more than a 10-fold drop-in potency
for the unsubstituted derivative.

As mentioned earlier, introducing
steric hindrance is a known hERG
mitigation strategy. We accordingly synthesized and evaluated double
halogenation products of the Western substituent. Several substituents
were introduced in the 4-position of the benzimidazole scaffold while
keeping the piperazinyl as the Eastern substituent (Table 4). Compound 42a with an additional chlorine atom at the 4-position showed equal
or slightly improved Pf activity against both NF54
and K1 strains in comparison to the 4-unsubstituted derivative 3, whereas the 4-Br derivative 42k was equipotent
or slightly less potent. Unfortunately, both derivatives were ∼4-fold
more cytotoxic than the 4-unsubstituted compound 3 and
the SI index dropped below 500 as a consequence. Introducing larger
aromatic substituents in compounds 52a and 52b was not tolerated.

On the basis
of literature precedence,34 we reasoned
that incorporation of a nitrogen atom into the Western
substituent might result in improved Pf potency and
reduce hERG activity. Hence, a couple of changes to the core were
investigated by incorporating an additional nitrogen (Table 5). Unfortunately, these modifications
(57a and 57b) led to inactive compounds.

SAR of the
Southern Substituent
For the investigation
of the Southern substituent, the piperazinyl moiety was fixed as the
Eastern substituent on the basis that compounds with this moiety showed
activity. The Western substituent was left unchanged, or we used the
corresponding unsubstituted derivative, to have matched pairs for
comparison (Table 6). Removal of the 1-carbon spacer in the N-benzyl
group (16f) or introducing an additional spacer (16g) led to inactive compounds. Replacing the phenyl group
with a hydrogen (60), cyclohexyl (14h),
or 2-/4-pyridyl (59 and 14i) groups also
resulted in inactive compounds. The combination of a one-carbon spacer
and a phenyl ring (3) was found to be optimal for maintaining
the Pf activity as the other N-replacements were
not tolerated.

In Vitro, hERG
Channel Activity, and Metabolic Stability
Selected compounds
with good antiplasmodium activity were further
evaluated for hERG channel inhibition (Table 7). Unfortunately,
only one compound (33) showed some marginal improvement.
The nonbasic compounds 18 and 19 showed
only marginal improvement in the hERG liability but substantial loss
in antiplasmodium activity. The only compound with a better hERG profile
was the one containing an ethylenediamine side chain (33), leading to a still unsatisfactory 10-fold safety window.

The microsomal
metabolic stability of the active analogues was

Pharmacokinetic
Studies in Rats
On the basis of the
good in vitro antiplasmodium activity and solubility data, in vivo
pharmacokinetics (PK) studies in rats were initiated for compound 3, with the goal to assess the exposure and oral bioavailability
in rodent species. Following intravenous administration at 1 mg/kg
dose, compound 3 displayed high total systemic clearance
(>100% hepatic blood flow) and high volume of distribution (>5
L/kg),
resulting in a moderate half-life (1.98 h) (Table 8). Following oral administration at 5 mg/kg
dose, compound 3 showed rapid absorption, reasonable
exposure, and moderate oral bioavailability (42%).

poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)200 for intravenous administration and
0.5% methyl cellulose/0.5% Tween 80 in water for oral administration.

In Vivo Efficacy Studies
On the basis of the potent
in vitro activity and promising in vitro physicochemical properties
(Table 2 and 9), the frontrunner compounds were further profiled
in vivo for efficacy in a Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum mouse model. Compounds 2 and 3 were evaluated in the P. berghei mouse model (Table 10). One day post infection, P. berghei infected mice were treated orally with
a single dose of 100 mg/kg of the respective compound. The key readouts
were the percentage of parasitemia reduction on day 3 post infection
compared with untreated mice and mouse survival prolongation (Figure 3). Both compounds
showed good parasitemia reduction (>90%) with 6–7 days of
survival.
Among this, compound 3 displayed better in vivo activity
(99%) presumably due to its better Cmax and exposure reached in these animals. Therefore, compound 3 was evaluated in the P. falciparum severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model (Table 10 and Figure 3). On day 3 post infection, mice were dosed
orally, once a day for 4 days at a dose of 25 mg/kg. 3 reduced 99.9% of the parasitemia in the Pf SCID
mouse model at day 7 of the study. Overall, this compound displayed
good in vivo potency and induced clearance of asexual parasites from
peripheral blood comparable to chloroquine (dosed 4 × 50 mg/kg)
in the P. falciparum mouse model.

Conclusions and Discussion
A novel series of 1,2,5-trisubstituted benzimidazoles was identified
from phenotypic whole cell high-throughput screening of the Novartis
chemical library. A broad range of structurally diverse benzimidazoles
were synthesized and assessed for in vitro antiplasmodium activity.
SAR analysis indicated that several of the synthesized compounds displayed
promising activity (IC50 NF54 <0.1 μM). As expected,
addition of a functional group (H → Me → Cl) increases
lipophilicity and plasma protein binding (Table 9). Overall, these compounds displayed good
solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability in mouse and human
species. However, in vitro clearance was moderate to high in rat and
that translated to high in vivo total systemic clearance (Table 8). Additionally, the
frontrunner compound displayed good parasitemia reduction in two malaria
mouse models (Table 10 and Figure 3); however,
survival rates as determined in the P. berghei model were poor and equated to the vehicle-treated animals. Further
lead optimization needs to be carried out to address the unresolved
hERG liability of the series, as well as the high plasma clearance
and short half-life of the compounds (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Overview of the SAR Trends of the
Series
Experimental Section
All commercially available chemicals were purchased from either
Sigma-Aldrich or Combi-Blocks. All solvents were dried by appropriate
techniques. Unless otherwise stated, all solvents used were anhydrous. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Brucker Spectrometer at 300
or 400 MHz. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed
on aluminum-backed silica-gel 60 F254 (70–230 mesh)
plates. Flash column chromatography was performed with Merck silica-gel
60 (70–230 mesh). Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm
downfield from trimethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Coupling
constants, J, are recorded in hertz (Hz). Purity
was determined by HPLC, and all compounds were confirmed to have >95%
purity. The data that is not shown below is supplied in the Supporting Information.

Aqueous Solubility
Water solubility was analyzed using
a miniaturized shake flask method. Ten millimolar stock solutions
of each of the compounds were used to prepare calibration standards
(10–220 μM) in DMSO. The same 10 mM stock solutions were
accurately dispensed in duplicate into 96-well plates, and the DMSO,
dried down (MiVac GeneVac, 90 min, 37 °C). Thereafter, the samples
were reconstituted (200 μM) in an aqueous solution and shaken
(20 h, 25 °C). The solutions were analyzed by means of HPLC-DAD
(Agilent 1200 Rapid Resolution HPLC with a diode array detector).
Best fit calibration curves were constructed using the calibration
standards, which were used to determine the aqueous samples’
solubility.36

Metabolic Stability Assay
The metabolic stability assay
was performed in duplicate in a 96-well microtiter plate. The test
compounds (0.1 μM) were incubated (37 °C) in mouse, rat,
and pooled human liver microsomes (final protein concentration of
0.4 mg/mL; XenoTech, Lenexa, KS) suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) for predetermined time points, in the presence and absence
of the cofactor-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) (1 mM). The reactions were quenched by the addition of ice
cold acetonitrile containing an internal standard (carbamazepine,
0.0236 μg/mL). The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant
was analyzed by means of liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) (Agilent Rapid Resolution HPLC, AB
SCIEX 4500 MS). The relative loss of the parent compound over time
was monitored and plots were prepared for each compound of Ln% remaining
versus time to determine the first-order rate constant for compound
depletion. This was used to calculate the degradation half-life and
in vitro intrinsic clearance value and subsequently to predict the
in vivo intrinsic clearance and in vivo hepatic extraction ratio (EH). Metabolite searches were not conducted during
the metabolic stability assay.35

In Vitro
Antiplasmodium Assay
All parasite strains
were acquired from MR4 (Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource
Center, Manassas, VA). Compounds were tested using parasite lactate
dehydrogenase assay as a marker for parasite survival.37 Briefly, the respective stock solutions of CQ
diphosphate and test compounds were prepared to 2 mg/mL in distilled
water (for CQ) and 100% DMSO for test compounds and then stored at
−20 °C, and further dilutions were prepared on the day
of the experiment. The cultures were synchronized in the ring stage
as described previously using 15 mL of 5% (w/v) d-sorbitol
in water.38 Synchronous cultures of PfNF54 (CQS) and Pf K1 (CQR) in the late
trophozoite stage were prepared to 2% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit.
Compounds were tested at starting concentrations of 10 000
ng/mL (1000 ng/mL for CQ), which were then serially diluted twofold
in complete medium to give 10 concentrations with a final volume of
200 μL in each well. Parasites were incubated in the presence
of the compounds at 37 °C in a specialized atmosphere of 4% CO2 and 3% O2 in nitrogen for 48 h. Following incubation,
100 μL of MalStat reagent and 15 μL of resuspended culture
were combined, followed by addition of 25 μL of nitro blue tetrazolium
chloride (NBT). The plates were kept in the dark for about 10 min
to fully develop, and absorbance was measured at 620 nm on a microplate
reader. Raw data were exported to Microsoft Excel for dose-response
analysis.

Cytotoxicity Assay
Compounds were screened for in vitro
cytotoxicity against Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) mammalian cell
lines, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The reference standard, emetine, was prepared
to 2 mg/mL in distilled water while stock solutions of test compounds
were prepared to 20 mg/mL in 100% DMSO with the highest concentration
of solvent to which the cells were exposed having no measurable effect
on the cell viability. The initial concentration of the compounds
and control was 100 μg/mL, which was serially diluted in complete
medium with 10-fold dilutions to give six concentrations, the lowest
being 0.001 μg/mL. Plates were incubated for 48 h with 100 μL
of drug and 100 μL of cell suspension in each well and developed
afterward by adding 25 μL of sterile MTT (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
to each well, followed by 4 h of incubation in the dark. The plates
were then centrifuged; the medium was aspirated, and 100 μL
of DMSO was added to dissolve crystals before reading the absorbance
at 540 nm. Data were analyzed, and the sigmoidal dose-response was
derived using GraphPad Prism v 4.0 software (La Jolla). All experiments
were performed for at least three independent biological repeats,
each with technical triplicates.

In Vivo Efficacy Studies
P. berghei Mouse Model
In vivo antimalarial
activity was assessed for groups of five female
NMRI mice (20–22 g) intravenously infected on day 0 with P. berghei GFP ANKA malaria strain (2 × 107 parasitized erythrocytes, donation from AP Waters and CJ
Janse, Leiden University). Untreated control mice die typically between
day 6 and day 7 post infection. Experimental compounds were formulated
(in 0.5% methyl cellulose/0.5% Tween 80) and administered orally in
a volume of 10 mL/kg as a single dose (24 h postinfection) of 100
mg/kg. Parasitaemia was determined 72 h post infection using standard
flow cytometry techniques. Activity was calculated as the difference
between the mean percent parasitaemia for the control and treated
groups expressed as a percent relative to the control group. The survival
time in days was also recorded up to 30 days after infection. A compound
was considered curative if the animal survived to day 30 after infection
with no detectable parasites by slide reading.

P. falciparum SCID Mouse Model
Compound
efficacy was assessed in the murine P.
falciparum SCID model essentially as described.39 Briefly, compound 3, formulated
in 7% Tween 80, 3% ethanol, was administered to a cohort of age-matched
female immunodeficient NOD-scid IL-2Rγnull mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) previously engrafted with human
erythrocytes (generously provided by the Blood Bank in Zürich,
Switzerland). The mice were intravenously infected with 2 × 107P. falciparum Pf3D70087/N9-infected erythrocytes (day 0).40 On day
3 after infection, mice were randomly allocated to treatments that
were administered once a day for 4 days (n = 2 mice)
by oral gavage at 25 mL/kg. Parasitemia was measured by microscopy.
Chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry using anti-murine erythrocyte
TER119 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and SYTO-16
and then analyzed by flow cytometry in serial 2 μL blood samples.

In vivo studies conducted at the Swiss TPH, Basel were approved
by the veterinary authorities of the Canton Basel-Stadt (permit no.
1731 and 2303) based on Swiss cantonal (Verordnung Veterinäramt
Basel-Stadt) and national regulations (the Swiss animal protection
law, Tierschutzgesetz).

Step 1: General Procedure for
Suzuki Cross-Coupling
Bromo compounds 47/50 (1.0 equiv) and
appropriate aryl boronic acids (1.3 equiv) were taken in a pressure
vial in 1,4-dioxane (0.1 M) and water (0.318 M) (5:1) followed by
the addition of cesium carbonate (3.0 equiv) and [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II)

min; method used (general positive); LC–MS (APCI) m/z = found 459.2 (M + H)+ on a positive
mode M 280 nm [calcd for C26H31N6O2m/z = 459.25 (M +
H)+].

Step 2: General Procedure for
Boc-Deprotection
A Boc-protected compound (1 equiv) in 4
N HCl in dioxane (4 mL)
was stirred for 2–20 h. TLC and LC–MS of the reaction
indicated the complete consumption of the starting material. The reaction
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and diethyl ether (5
mL) was added. Then, the ppt was filtered off and washed with an excess
of diethyl ether (5 mL) to afford the desired hydrochloride salt in
low to moderate yields.

3.90–3.87 (m, 4H), 3.50–3.46 (m, 4H); HPLC purity 99%,
retention time (Rt) = 2.688 min; method
used (general positive); LC–MS (APCI) m/z = found 359.1 (M + H)+ on a positive mode M
280 nm [calcd for C21H24ClN6m/z = 395.1751 (M + H)+].
