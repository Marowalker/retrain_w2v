Selectivity
of kinase inhibitors, or the lack thereof, continues
to be an intensely debated topic in drug discovery research. Especially,
type I inhibitors, which represent most of the currently available
kinase inhibitors, are often thought to lack selectivity because they
target the largely conserved adenosine triphosphate-binding site in
kinases. Herein, we present a large-scale analysis of potential selectivity
among multikinase inhibitors, covering 141 human kinases and more
than 10 000 qualifying compounds. By design, the analysis was
focused on type I inhibitors and carried out at the level of systematically
generated kinase pairs sharing inhibitors. Kinase pair category- and
compound-based selectivity profiles identified in part highly selective
inhibitors for many kinases. Sets of inhibitors associated with kinase
pairs frequently contained nonselective as well as increasingly selective
compounds. Selectivity of inhibitors did not result from gatekeeper
residues settings or phylogenetic distance of kinases. Rather, it
was most likely attributable to subtle differences between binding
regions in kinases. Taken together, the results of our study reveal
that many multikinase inhibitors are more selective than one might
assume.

1 Introduction
Inhibitors of human kinases
are among the most intensely investigated
compounds in drug development.1−5 Most currently available kinase inhibitors target the adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) (cofactor)-binding site that is largely conserved
across the human kinome.6,7 Accordingly, ATP-site-directed
kinase inhibitors are expected to be promiscuous and lack selectivity,
as indicated by a number of kinase inhibitor profiling studies.8−11 Therefore, attempts have been made to discover other types of inhibitors
that target different regions in kinases and act by different mechanisms.12,13 ATP-site-directed (type I) inhibitors bind to the so-called “DFG-in”
conformation of the activation loop near the catalytic site, i.e.,
the active form of the kinase. In addition, type II inhibitors bind
to the inactive “DFG-out” conformation of the activation
segment, occupying pockets adjacent to the ATP-binding site that are
less conserved.13 Thus, type II inhibitors
are expected to be more selective than type I inhibitors. Furthermore,
there are type III and IV inhibitors that bind to regions outside
the ATP-binding site and act by allosteric mechanisms.13 Only a limited number of allosteric kinase inhibitors
has been reported thus far, but these types of inhibitors might indeed
be most selective.14−16

However, the often assumed lack of selectivity
of type I inhibitors
continues to be debated17 and expected
selectivity differences between type I and II inhibitors are subject
to further investigation. For example, profiling experiments using
type II inhibitors have shown that these inhibitors are often active
against many kinases.13 Furthermore, although
subsets of highly promiscuous type I inhibitors have been identified18 and promiscuity of kinase inhibitors has become
a hallmark for successful cancer treatment,2 there is also evidence for selectivity of ATP-site-directed inhibitors.
For example, although a number of kinase inhibitor profiling experiments
have indicated a lack of selectivity of type I inhibitors,8−11 others have revealed selectivity patterns.19,20 In addition, type I inhibitors are also capable of acting by different
mechanisms.21 Furthermore, on the basis
of high-confidence activity data, 76% of publicly available kinase
inhibitors were found to be annotated with a single kinase.22 When activity data confidence criteria were
iteratively lowered, no notable increase in kinase inhibitor promiscuity
was detected,23 suggesting that promiscuity
was not a general rule. Of course, it has long been known that the
ATP-binding site in kinases has some sequence variation, in particular,
at the “gatekeeper” position,7 where the presence of smaller or larger residues differentiates
between classes of type I inhibitors. However, whether or not the
gatekeeper is the only factor responsible for inhibitor differentiation
within the ATP-binding site is currently unknown. Other subtle differences
might also play a role. Clearly, the issue of kinase inhibitor selectivity
is still not fully explored.

Herein, we present a systematic
analysis of selectivity among multikinase
inhibitors on the basis of currently available activity data. Selectivity
profiles were generated for sets of inhibitors shared by kinases.
The profiles revealed significant potency variations of subsets of
inhibitors and identified compounds with selectivity for given kinases
over others.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Compounds, Targets, and Activity Data
Inhibitors of
human protein kinases were assembled from ChEMBL version
23.24 Compounds with activity in assays
detecting direct interactions (target relationship type “D”)
with human protein kinases at the highest confidence level (confidence
score 9) were selected. As potency measurements, IC50 values
were considered. The amount of available Ki values was too small for a meaningful statistical analysis. If multiple
IC50 values were available for a compound, the final potency
annotation was calculated as the geometric mean of these values, provided
all fell within the same order of magnitude (otherwise, the compound
was disregarded). Approximate measurements associated with “>”,
“<”, or “∼” were not taken into
account. On the basis of these criteria, 40 627 inhibitors
with activity against 274 human kinases were obtained. From this compound
pool, inhibitors were selected that were active against at least two
kinases, yielding a final set of 10 367 inhibitors with activity
against 266 human kinases. ChEMBL target identifiers of these kinases
were mapped to UniProt,25 and kinases were
assigned to families and groups (of families) according to Manning
et al.6 and Miranda-Saavedra et al.26

2.2 Protein Kinase Pairs
The selected
multikinase inhibitors were used to systematically form compound-based
target pairs. Two kinases were paired if they shared at least 10 inhibitors.
Given this constraint, a total of 596 pairs were obtained that included
141 kinases and 10 060 inhibitors. Kinase pairs were assigned
to three different categories: same family, i.e., both kinases belonged
to the same family (132 pairs); different families, i.e., both kinases
belonged to different families within the same kinase group (262 pairs);
and different groups, i.e., both kinases belonged to different groups
(202 pairs). Kinases in pairs from the same family, different families,
and different groups were increasingly distant (unrelated). For each
pair, compound selectivity was assessed by calculating the logarithmic
potency difference (ΔpIC50) for each inhibitor.

2.3 Gatekeeper Residue and Binding-Site Comparison
The kinase–ligand interaction fingerprints and structures
(KLIFS)27,28 database defines a kinase “binding
pocket” for type I–IV inhibitors as a set of 85 discontinuous
residues. This sequence segment, which contains the gatekeeper residue
at position 45, can be extracted for human kinases from KLIFS on the
basis of UniProt identifiers using the 3D-e-Chem-VM engine.29 For kinase pairs, gatekeeper residues were compared
and sequence identity over the 85-residue segment was calculated as
an indicator of binding-site resemblance. Phylogenetic trees of the
human kinome were drawn with Kinome Render.30

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Qualifying
Kinase Inhibitors
Figure 1 shows the distribution
of inhibitors over all 596 pairs of kinases sharing at least 10 compounds,
yielding a median value of 18 inhibitors per pair. Hence, kinase pairs
were associated with sufficient numbers of inhibitors for a systematic
assessment of selectivity profiles. The pairs involved 141 kinases
distributed across the human kinome and 10 060 multikinase
inhibitors from ChEMBL.

Figure 1 Distribution of compounds over kinase pairs.
The boxplot reports
the distribution of inhibitors over kinase pairs, yielding a median
value of 18 inhibitors per pair. Boxplots report the smallest value
(bottom line), first quartile (lower boundary of the box), median
value (thick line), third quartile (upper boundary of the box), largest
value (top line), and outliers (points below the smallest or above
the largest value).

Mapping of type II kinase
inhibitor signature fragments13 indicated
that less than 1% of kinase inhibitors
available in ChEMBL were type II inhibitors.18 Thus, although it is not exactly known how many type II, or rare
type III/IV, inhibitors are currently available in ChEMBL, for all
practical considerations, our analysis was focused on type I multikinase
inhibitors.

3.2 Global Selectivity
Potency differences
of inhibitors against kinases forming pairs were calculated as a measure
of selectivity. The larger the potency difference was, the more selective
an inhibitor was for one kinase over the other. Initially, the global
potency difference distribution was determined. Figure 2 (left) shows that average potency differences
for all inhibitors associated with a pair were rather small, with
a median ΔpIC50 value of 0.64 (i.e., well within
1 order of magnitude). At a first glance, this was what one might
expect for largely nonselective inhibitors. However, the picture changed
when only the inhibitor with largest potency difference from each
pair was considered, as also shown in Figure 2 (right). In this case, the distribution
yielded a median ΔpIC50 of 2.37, a difference of
more than 2 orders of magnitude (100-fold), and a third quartile difference
of 3 orders of magnitude. Thus, for individual inhibitors, a global
tendency of selectivity emerged. Systematically enumerating pairs
of kinases sharing inhibitors ensured that all possible selectivity
relationships were taken into account. The union of pairwise relationships
was expected to reveal general selectivity trends, if they existed.

Figure 2 Compound
potency differences for kinase pairs. Boxplots report
the distribution of potency differences of inhibitors for paired kinases
as the mean potency difference of all inhibitors (left) or the largest
potency difference (most selective compounds; right). The distributions
yield ΔpIC50 median values of 0.64 (left) and 2.37
(right).

The global selectivity tendency
was also observed at the level
of different kinase pair categories. Figure 3a shows the distribution of potency differences
for the three pair categories in different formats. In all three cases,
the median difference for all compounds fell within the same order
of magnitude and exceeded 2 orders of magnitude for the most selective
compounds.

Figure 3 Compound potency differences for pair categories. (a) Distributions
of ΔpIC50 values (left) for all versus the most selective
inhibitors according to Figure 2 for kinase pairs from the same family (blue, 132 pairs),
different families (green, 262 pairs), and different groups (red,
202 pairs). In addition, a comparison of ΔpIC50 median
values is shown (right). (b) Selectivity profiles for the three pair
categories that record the potency differences of the most selective
inhibitor for each pair (in the order of increasing potency differences
from left to right).

3.3 Pair Category-Based Selectivity Profiles
The global selectivity tendency was further corroborated by pair
category-based selectivity profiles shown in Figure 3b. These profiles were generated by recording
the largest inhibitor potency difference for each pair and ordering
the pairs by increasing ΔpIC50 values. In each case,
more than half of the kinase pairs had one or more inhibitors with
a potency difference exceeding 2 orders of magnitude. Furthermore,
in each case, potency differences exceeding 4 or even 5 orders of
magnitude were observed for multiple pairs. For kinases from different
groups, 55% of the pairs had inhibitor(s) with potency differences
of more than 2 orders of magnitude and 22% of more than 3 orders of
magnitude.

3.4 Compound-Based Selectivity
Profiles
Detailed views of inhibitor selectivity were provided
by compound-based
selectivity profiles. Figure 4 (left) shows exemplary profiles for kinase pairs from the
same family, different families, and different groups. Kinases from
each pair had the same gatekeeper residue. In these profiles, potency
values of all inhibitors are compared for kinases of a pair and inhibitors
are ordered according to increasing potency differences. In addition, Figure 4 shows the least
and most selective inhibitor for each pair (middle) and the location
of paired kinases on a phylogenetic tree representing the human kinome
(right). For each pair, the most selective inhibitor displayed a potency
difference of more than 4 or 5 orders of magnitude.

Figure 4 Compound-based selectivity
profiles. Left: exemplary compound selectivity
profiles for kinase pairs belonging to different categories. For each
inhibitor, the potency against the two kinases is compared. From the
left to the right, inhibitors are ordered according to increasing
potency differences. On the lower right of each graph, gatekeeper
residues of the kinase pair are reported (e.g., “M|M”).
Middle: comparison of the least and most selective inhibitors for
each pair. Right: kinases forming each pair are mapped onto a phylogenetic
tree of the human kinome to illustrate their category relationships.

The selectivity profiles revealed
in part striking differences
in relative potencies between inhibitors. Compounds shared by the
closely related protein kinase C eta type (PKCh) and protein kinase
C theta type (PKCt) were generally slightly more potent against PKCh,
preserving relative potency differences. However, two notable exceptions
were detected, where potency against PKCh decreased sharply. In one
of these cases, the inhibitor was essentially inactive against PKCh
but retained high potency against PKCt, resulting in high selectivity
for PKCt. The profile for macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor
kinase (FMS) and tyrosine-protein kinase Lck (LCK) contained six inhibitors
with comparable potency and four others with increasing potency differences
and selectivity for FMS over LCK. Moreover, for the distantly related
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and aurora kinase
A (AurA), there were five inhibitors with the same potency against
both kinases, three with relatively small potency differences, and
12 others that were essentially inactive against PDK1 but increasingly
potent against AurA, yielding a subset of selective AurA inhibitors.
The most selective compound had a potency difference of nearly 6 orders
of magnitude. Many other profiles revealing similar selectivity relationships
were obtained. Thus, many inhibitors shared by pairs of 141 human
kinases were highly selective, a rather unexpected finding.

3.5 Comparison of Gatekeeper Residues, Binding
Regions, and Compound Selectivity
In light of these findings,
we further investigated whether there might be straightforward explanations
for the observed selectivity trends. Therefore, for all kinase pairs,
combinations of gatekeeper residues were determined. For each gatekeeper
combination, the number of pairs associated with inhibitor(s) having
a ΔpIC50 of at least 2 orders of magnitude (selectivity
criterion) was identified and compared to the number of pairs not
meeting this selectivity criterion. The results are shown in Figure 5a. For most gatekeeper
combinations, including conserved and different residues, more pairs
with selective than nonselective inhibitors were available. Hence,
conservation of gatekeeper residues did not preclude compound selectivity,
as also illustrated in Figure 4, and for all gatekeeper combinations represented by multiple
kinase pairs, selective inhibitors were available.

Figure 5 Gatekeeper residues,
binding pocket similarity, and compound selectivity.
(a) Histograms compare the number of kinase target pairs for each
observed combination of gatekeeper residues (top, conserved residues;
bottom, different residues), for which one or more selective (red)
or no selective (gray) inhibitors were available. As a selectivity
criterion, a potency difference of at least 2 orders of magnitude
(ΔpIC50 ≥ 2) was applied. (b) Swarm plot (i.e.,
a boxplot in which all individual data points are displayed) capturing
distributions of binding pocket similarity (sequence identity over
the 85-residue segment) of kinases in pairs belonging to different
categories to the presence (red) or absence (gray) of selective inhibitors.
Individual data points on the X-axis are centered
on the not displayed boxplot whisker for each category and depart
from the central position if additional points have the same binding
pocket similarity value. The percentage of kinase pairs with selective
inhibitors (“selective pairs”) is given for each category.
(c) Distribution of compounds over kinase pairs in different categories.
In addition, the proportion of selective inhibitors is given.

Furthermore, binding pocket similarity
was calculated for all kinase
pairs with selective inhibitors and others, as shown in Figure 5b. As expected, the similarity
of binding regions decreased with increasing phylogenetic distances
of paired kinases. However, pairs with selective and nonselective
inhibitors were widely distributed over the entire similarity range,
including all three pair categories. Hence, there was no detectable
correlation between similarities of binding regions and the presence
or absence of selective inhibitors. As shown in Figure 5b, even kinases with highly similar binding
regions shared inhibitors that were selective. In addition, for each category, the percentage
of kinase pairs for which selective inhibitors were available is provided.
More than half of the kinase pairs in each category had selective
inhibitors. However, there was no detectable correlation between the
frequency of pairs with selected inhibitors and phylogenetic distance.
Taken together, these findings indicated that rather subtle structural
and/or property differences between kinases were largely responsible
for the selectivity of shared inhibitors.

Figure 5c shows
the distribution of shared inhibitors over kinase pairs from different
categories. The number of shared inhibitors decreased with increasing
phylogenetic distance between kinases in pairs. For each category,
the proportion of selective unique inhibitors was also calculated.
As expected, the percentage of selective inhibitors increased with
increasing phylogenetic distance, as also shown in Figure 5c.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we have analyzed potential selectivity of multikinase
inhibitors on a large scale based on currently available compound
activity data. Previous studies have focused on kinase inhibitor selectivity
profiling to identify new chemical probes for orphan receptors or
compounds active against still little explored therapeutically relevant
kinases.31,32 Our analysis was facilitated by systematically
generating pairs of 141 qualifying human kinases with increasing phylogenetic
distances that shared 10 or more inhibitors, providing a new reference
frame for selectivity analysis. Contrary to our initial expectations,
pair category- and compound-based selectivity profiles introduced
herein revealed the presence of subsets of in part highly selective
inhibitors for the majority of kinase pairs, providing extensive kinase
coverage. Because the analysis was based on a statistically significant
sample of more than 10 000 multikinase inhibitors, the detected
selectivity trends were sound. Some striking observations were made
at the level of compound-based selectivity profiles. In many instances,
sets of inhibitors associated with kinase pairs contained subsets
of nonselective compounds and others that were increasingly selective.
These observations were of particular interest because the analysis
was intrinsically focused on type I kinase inhibitors, which are often
(but not always) thought to lack selectivity. We have also shown that
observed inhibitor selectivity was not attributable to well-known
kinase features, such as gatekeeper constellations or phylogenetic
distances. It follows that selectivity determinants in kinases are
likely to result from subtle differences that are far from being obvious,
which should provide ample opportunities for future research. Clearly,
although much progress has been made in recent years in rationalizing
kinase inhibition and underlying mechanisms of actions, especially
at the structural level, the jury on kinase inhibitor selectivity
and its possible molecular origins is still out there. To support
further exploration of kinase inhibitor selectivity, our kinase pair
and inhibitor data set is made freely available as an open access
deposition.33
