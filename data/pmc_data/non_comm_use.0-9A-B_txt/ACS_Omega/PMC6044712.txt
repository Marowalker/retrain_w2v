Surface
properties of biomaterials can strongly influence biomaterial–host
interactions. For this reason, coating processes open a wide range
of possibilities to modulate the fate of a biomaterial in the body.
This study evaluates the effect of a coating material intended for
drug delivery capsules on biocompatibility and the release of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), that is, respiratory burst in macrophages that
indicates acute inflammation. In parallel with a new approach to develop
drug-delivery capsules by directly coating solid-state drug particles,
in this study, glass slides and silicon nanoparticles (NPs) were coated
with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) using atomic layer
deposition. Different sizes of NPs (20 and 310 nm) were suspended
at different concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL) and were
evaluated. The homogeneous coating of slides was proved using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, and the coating on NP was observed using
transmission electron microscopy. Human dermal fibroblasts and human
osteoblasts were able to proliferate on the coated slides and in the
presence of a suspension of coated NPs (20 and 310 nm) at a low concentration
(10 μg/mL). The macrophages released ROS only when in contact
with NPs at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL, where the 20 nm NPs
caused a higher release of ROS than the 310 nm NPs. This study shows
that Al2O3 coatings do not affect the cells
negatively and that the cell viability was compromised only when in
contact with a high concentration (1000 μg/mL) of smaller (20
nm) NPs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biomaterials have been
used over decades with the principal aim
to restore the function of tissues.1 Nowadays,
biomaterials are used in a wide range of applications such as tissue
engineering, medical imaging, diagnosis, and drug delivery.2 The interaction between a biomaterial and the
host tissue is mainly determined by the physical properties of the
biomaterials, such as surface, size, and mechanical properties.2 These properties in fact determine the application
of the biomaterials and their fate in the host body.2,3 The surface properties of a biomaterial, which depend on its reactive
sites and topography, determine the interaction with surrounding molecules,
from small functional groups to proteins.4 These interactions are of prime importance because they will determine
whether proteins adhere on a biomaterial with a functional state and
further react with cell receptors.

To modify the surface properties
of biomaterials, coating techniques
have been used. Plasma spray, physical vapor deposition, and chemical
vapor deposition are some of the most common techniques4 to perform inorganic, organic, and inorganic–organic
coatings on inorganic materials.2,5 Atomic layer deposition
(ALD) is a type of chemical vapor deposition technique that can be
used to form nanometer thick coatings on three-dimensional samples
with complex shapes. The ALD procedure consists of exposing the sample
alternatively to gaseous precursors instead of having them present
simultaneously in the reactor, as usually performed in chemical vapor
deposition techniques. The process is repeated in cycles to grow a
layer of substrate of desired nanometer thickness.5

A novel approach to produce drug-delivery systems
(DDSs) consisting
of solid-state drug particles directly coated with a ceramic material
has been recently developed by Nanexa and trademarked as PharmaShell.
The thickness of the coating, which can be controlled down to a monolayer
of atoms, is designed to fulfill the desired drug-release profile.
This DDS offers an opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry to
develop controlled-release versions of established drugs with a high
drug-to-weight ratio.

The use of nanoscale biomaterials, mainly
used as DDSs, has increased
in the last decade,6,7 raising the question of whether
nanoparticles (NPs) are safe enough.8 NPs
cannot be viewed as simple carriers because they play an active role
in mediating biological effects.9 The size
of the NPs determines the circulation time and the interaction with
inflammatory cells such as macrophages.2 Macrophages, which are distributed in several tissues to detect
invading pathogens, may perform endocytosis of NPs and as well may
trigger an acute inflammatory response.10 The acute inflammatory response mainly consists of the release of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) aimed to destroy any pathogen or foreign
body11,12 and the release of cyto- and chemokines
that stimulate endothelial cells and fibroblasts to grow a vascularized
tissue around the biomaterial.13,14 Several studies have
shown how the cytotoxicity of NPs depends mainly on their size, shape,
chemistry, and surface properties.7,9,15

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect
of aluminum oxide
coatings on the growth of fibroblasts and osteoblasts and the release
of ROS by macrophages. For this purpose, inert slides and NPs have
been used instead of solid-state drug particles. The slides allowed
us to determine the effect of the chemical nature of the coating,
whereas the NPs allowed us to investigate the effect of the particle
size.

2.1 Characterization of the
Coated Slides Using
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Figure 1 shows a representative X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of an Al2O3-coated glass slide. Signals from aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and
carbon were detected in all cases. The elemental composition and atomic
ratio are given in Table 1. The O/Al atomic ratio was 2.3, whereas the O/(Al + C) atomic
ratio was 1.6.

2.2 Characterization of the Coated NPs Using Transmission
Electron Microscopy
NP suspensions were visualized using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2 shows suspensions of NP310 and NP20. NP310
showed separated particles with a round morphology of ∼300
nm in diameter (Figure 2a), whereas NP20 formed agglomerates of ∼20 nm NPs (Figure 2b) probably owing
to their higher surface energy. Figure 2c shows a zoomed area of NP310, where the coating around
the particle can be visualized and approximated to be 15–30
nm.

(b) NP20. (c) Zoomed area of NP310.

2.3 Cytotoxicity Assay
The cell viability
on coated glass slides showed very similar trends for both cell lines
used, human dermal fibroblasts (hDF) and human osteoblasts (Saos-2)
(Figure 3). A similar
fluorescence was determined for the coated samples and controls at
day 1 (p = 0.763 and 0.292 for hDF and Saos-2, respectively),
showing that the cells were able to proliferate equally well on the
coated material as on the controls. Moreover, a statistically significant
increase in fluorescence was observed for both cell lines on both
materials (coated samples and controls) from day 1 to day 3 (p = 0 for all). The number of cells on day 3 was similar
on the coated samples and controls (p = 0.621 and
0.766 for hDF and Saos-2, respectively), showing that a similar proliferation
rate occurred on both surfaces. Both hDF and Saos-2 adhered and spread
on the Al2O3-coated samples at 24 h (Figure 4).

(a) hDF cells and (b) Saos-2 cells. Fluorescence
intensity directly related to the cell number. A.U. stands for arbitrary
units. No statistical differences (p > 0.05) were
detected between the number of cells on the coated slides and on the
control at each time point. The error bars indicated the standard
deviation of triplicate samples.

Figure 4 Cell morphology observed 3 days after cell seeding on the materials:
(a) Saos-2 seeded on coated glass slides and (b) on TCPS (control);
(c) hDF seeded on coated glass slides and (d) on TCPS (control).

The viability of cells in contact
with a suspension (10, 100, and
1000 μg/mL) of coated NPs of different sizes (20 and 310 nm)
was evaluated (Figure 5). Regarding hDF, at day 1, no significant difference (p = 1 for all cases) in the cell number was observed between the samples
and the control. Cells cultured with any concentration of NP310, or
cultured with NP20 at 10 and 100 μg/mL, increased significantly
(p = 0) in cell number from day 1 to day 3. At day
3, only NP20 at 1000 μg/mL showed a significantly lower cell
number than the control (p = 0.017). Although not
statistically significant, NP310 at 1000 μg/mL and NP20 at 100
μg/mL caused a decrease in the cell number in comparison with
the control. Similar results were observed for Saos-2, where only
cells cultured with NP20 at 100 and 1000 μg/mL showed a significantly
lower cell number than the control both at day 1 and day 3 (p = 0 for both concentrations and times). Cells cultured
with NP310 at 1000 μg/mL also showed a significantly lower cell
number (p = 0) than the control at day 3.

assay of (a) hDF cells and (b) Saos-2 cells. Cell
viability is directly related to the fluorescence intensity. The values
(10, 100, and 1000) indicate the concentration of the suspension of
NPs in micrograms per milliliter. A.U. stands for arbitrary units
and C– stands for negative control. * indicates statistical
difference (p < 0.05) between the indicated sample
and the negative control at the corresponding time. The error bars
indicate the standard deviation of triplicate samples.

2.4 Release of ROS
Figure 6a shows luminescence
signals when the macrophages
were exposed to 1000 μg/mL NPs. Nonactivated cells and PMA-activated
cells were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The
luminescence signals
are correlated with the amount of ROS released by cells, which is
attributed to an acute inflammatory response.16 The activated cells released the highest amount of ROS, peaking
at around 13 min. NP20 induced the cells to release a higher amount
of ROS than that of NP310, both showing maximum peaks at around 17
min. Nonactivated cells did not cause any peak (Figure 6a). The macrophages exposed to 10 and 100
μg/mL of NPs showed a similar trend as the nonactivated cells
(not included in Figure 6a for clarity). Figure 6b shows the values obtained by integrating the area under the luminescent
curve and normalizing by the negative control. According to the integrated
area, the release of ROS followed the order: +C > NP20 [1000] >
NP310
[1000] > NP20 [10] and [100] ≈ NP310 at [10] and [100] ≈
−C.

Figure 6 (a) Normalized luminescence detected when RAW 264.7 was in contact
with the NPs (1000 μg/mL of NP310 and NP20). Luminescence is
directly proportional to the release of ROS. NPs at 10 and 100 μg/mL
showed luminescence similar to that of −C and therefore are
not shown. (b) Area under the luminescent curve normalized by the
negative control. −C stands for negative control (nonactivated
cells), and +C stands for positive control. Different letters indicate
significant differences between groups (p < 0.05).
The error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate samples.

3 Discussion
A new approach to synthesize drugs with a high amount of active
principle per weight consists of directly coating a drug particle
with an inorganic material using the ALD technique (Figure 7). This unique DDS, trademarked
as PharmaShell by Nanexa, offers a versatile way for generating carriers
of any thickness as they can be directly fabricated on top of the
drug particles. This technique could thus be revolutionary for pharmaceutical
companies that are seeking new ways to produce more efficient products
(with high drug/carrier mass ratio). However, coating drugs or biomaterials
with inorganic compounds modifies their surface properties and has
the potential to strongly influence their host interactions. This
study evaluated
the responses of two different cell types with respect to cytocompatibility
and the release of ROS using inert slides and NPs coated with aluminum
oxide.

Figure 7 Scheme of (a) a glass slide and (b) a silicon oxide NP, before
and after being coated with Al2O3.

The ALD conditions used are important to control
the thickness
of the coating. Under the conditions applied in our study, a thickness
of 15–30 nm was formed on NP310 after applying 200 cycles,
which correlates well with a growth rate of 0.11 nm per cycle described
by Ott et al.17 using similar conditions.

The coating around NP310 particles (Figure 2c) was observed using TEM, thanks to the
difference in electron density between silicon oxide and aluminum
oxide, which creates a contrast between the coating and the particle.
The TEM images observed in this study correlated well with the images
displayed by a previous study that also used ALD to coat silicon oxide
particles with aluminum oxide.18 In the
case of NP20s, these NPs tended to agglomerate as shown in Figure 2b. The composition
and homogeneity of the coating on glass slides were evaluated using
XPS (Figure 1, Table 1). The coating was
composed of atoms of aluminum and oxygen with a similar O/Al ratio
in all replicate samples, proving a good homogeneity of the coating.
The O/Al ratio was 2.2, a value significantly higher than the O/Al
ratio of 1.5 that would be expected in the case of forming a stoichiometric
aluminum oxide. The O/(Al + C) was 1.6, which suggested the presence
of some C, probably in the form of methyl groups, from the initial
reagent trimethyl aluminum (TMA), in accordance with the study of
Kim et al.19 The chemical
composition of the coating on the NPs was expected to be the same
as the one determined on the slides because the same ALD principle
was applied.

The cytotoxicity was evaluated using human cell
lines from two
different tissues because these potential DDS could come in contact
with different parts of the body. hDF and Saos-2 were selected because
they are commonly used to evaluate the biocompatibility of biomaterials.20 Moreover, it is known that NPs can lead to different
cell fates depending on the cell type.12

Both hDF and Saos-2 cells were able to grow equally well on
the
aluminum oxide-coated slides as on the control material, that is,
tissue-culture treated polystyrene (TCPS) (Figure 3). TCPS was used as a control because serum
proteins adsorb well on this material, resulting in multiple binding
sites for focal cell adhesions.21 Spread
cell morphology on aluminum oxide-coated slides (Figure 4) indicated that proteins adsorbed
on this surface facilitate cell binding and that aluminum oxide was
not toxic but allowed cell growth. These results correlated well with
the known characteristics of alumina, a nearly inert material widely
used in hip implants because of its good biocompatibility and excellent
corrosion resistance.22

Cells proliferated
almost as well when cultured in contact with
a low concentration of NPs (10 μg/mL) as compared with that
of fresh media (Figure 5). This result showed that this particular dose of NPs was innocuous
for the cells. These results also correlated well with a previous
study in which aluminum oxide NPs (diameter size of 40 nm) at a concentration
of 100 μg/mL or lower did not show cytotoxicity.23 Similarly, Taylor et al. used nanotubes (0.5–40
μm × 40 nm) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL and reported
that cytotoxicity and inflammatory response in vitro were improved
by coating the nanotubes with aluminum oxide.24

At all concentrations, the smaller NPs (NP20) decreased cell
proliferation
more than the bigger NPs (NP310), in accordance with the previous
studies.7,25,26 It should
be taken into account that at a specific mass concentration (μg/mL),
the surface-to-volume ratio is higher for smaller particles, which
implies increased NP–cell interactions26 and more mobility of the NPs inside of the cell.7,26 The
cytotoxicity of NPs was shown to be dose-dependent,7 the threshold concentration depending on overall particle
volume instead of absolute particle numbers.27

The main reason that coated NPs cause cytotoxicity is still
not
exactly clear.28 The insolubility of aluminum
oxide in neutral aqueous solutions29 allows
a potential toxicity caused by the release of aluminum ions to be
discarded. However, NPs can stick onto the cell membrane,30 damage the cell membrane,24 or enter into the cells (cytoplasm and/or nucleus) either
by endocytosis or by diffusion through the cytoplasm owing to their
small size.7 The interactions between the
NPs and the cells may cause apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis
(traumatic cell death), or just remain in the cell without causing
any changes to cell function.31 NPs may
also be responsible in decreasing the amount of cellular antioxidant
glutathione (GSH) either by binding to it, inhibiting its synthesis
or by depleting the GSH levels.28,32

NPs are known
to activate inflammatory cells, whose response could
in turn harm surrounding cells such as fibroblasts or osteoblasts.7,26,32 Acute inflammatory response is
usually characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines
(e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and an oxidative burst,
that is, the release of ROS and nitric oxide.7,11,33 In this study, we correlated the release
of ROS to the level of acute inflammatory response of macrophages;
evaluating the release of proinflammatory cytokines was beyond the
aim of this study. In good accordance with the cytotoxicity assay,
the macrophages released a higher amount of ROS when in contact with
smaller NPs (NP20) than with bigger NPs (NP310). This result may be
related to the higher amount of NPs that could penetrate into the
cells because of their smaller size, in accordance with the previous
studies.12,26 Regarding the concentration of NPs, the
highest concentration (1000 μg/mL) caused a prominent release
of ROS, in contrast with the inexistent release of ROS caused by doses
of 10 and 100 μg/mL. This release of ROS in a concentration-dependent
manner was in agreement with previous studies.23,26,28 The inflammatory effect of the aluminum
oxide itself was expected to be low as previously reported by Warashina
et al.34 after implantation of this ceramic
on murine calvarial bone.

This study opens the door to use ALD
to coat drug particles with
a specific ceramic thickness, which would therefore allow a controlled
drug release. A low dose of NPs coated with aluminum oxide was shown
to be biocompatible and to induce a negligible amount of ROS.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Samples
Glass slides
(Warner Instruments, ref no. 64-0713) and silicon oxide NPs were coated
with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) using atomic layer
deposition (ALD) (Figure 7). Al2O3 coatings were deposited using
a SUNALE R-series ALD reactor from Picosun.

TMA (98% pure from
ABCR) and deionized water were used as precursors, and nitrogen (99.999%
pure) was used as a carrier gas. The reactants were applied in the
gas state. During each coating cycle, the reactants were fed for enough
time to saturate all active sites. After each pulse of reagent, nitrogen
was flushed into the system for purging any unreacted reagent and
gaseous byproducts such as methane molecules formed during the reaction.
This is an important step to ensure that precursors reacted only on
the surface of the growing film. The chemical reactions occurring
have been previously described.18,35

All depositions
were made at 100 °C and a total pressure of
10 hPa. Depositions on slides were made using 3000 cycles. Before
deposition, the substrates were cleaned for 5 min in ethanol in an
ultrasonic bath. The deposition on SiO2 NPs with diameters
of 20 nm (Skyspring Nanomaterials, ref no. 6808NM) and 310 nm (∼2.0
g/cm3, MicroSil Microspheres, Bangs Laboratories Inc.,
ref no. SS02N/10973) was made using 200 cycles. All particles were
used as received and distributed as evenly as possible in an aluminum
oxide-passivated shallow steel cup, before deposition.

In this
study, the word “nanoparticle” (NP) has been
used even though commonly NPs are defined as particles having at least
one dimension smaller than 100 nm.36 However,
for simplification, the nomenclature used for the studies with particles
of nanometric size was NP20 and NP310, where NP stands for nanoparticles
and 20 and 310 indicate the diametrical size of the initial NPs in
nanometers.

4.2 Characterization of the
Coated Slides Using
XPS
The chemical composition of the coated slides was analyzed
using XPS (Quantum 2000, Al Kα X-ray source, Physical Electronics
Inc., USA). A presputtering process was performed to remove the possible
contamination on the surfaces. Survey spectra and high-resolution
spectra were recorded from areas of size 200 × 200 μm2. The relative concentration (atom %) of detected elements
was calculated from the relative intensities of peaks, after correction
for tabulated sensitivity factors in the software of the instrument.
The coated slides were analyzed in triplicate samples.

4.3 Characterization of the Coated NPs Using TEM
TEM was
performed using a Jeol JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope.
Samples for TEM examination were prepared by soaking a 300 mesh carbon-coated
copper grid in a suspension of NPs followed by blotting to remove
the excess liquid and air-dried. The NP suspension was obtained by
dispersing the NP in Milli-Q water (18 MΩ cm, Q-POD from Millipore).

4.4 Cell Culture Studies
The cytocompatibility
was evaluated using human cell lines from two different tissues, hDF
and Saos-2. A mouse leukemic macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was
used as the immune cell model, to evaluate the inflammatory response.

The cells were maintained in cell culture flasks in an incubator
under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C.
DME/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
was used as a culture medium. The culture medium was exchanged every
second day. Upon 70%–80% confluence, hDF and Saos-2 were detached
and were either used for the experimental study or seeded again in
new flasks. Cells were detached with a minimum amount of trypsin 0.25%
in EDTA that was inactivated with complete DME/F medium after 10 min.
Macrophages were detached by scratching them in a single direction
using a cell scraper.

4.4.1 Cytocompatibility Assay
The cytocompatibility
assay of the chemical nature of the aluminum oxide coating was evaluated
by growing cells of different tissues (hDF and Saos-2) on coated slides.
Aluminum oxide-coated slides (⌀ = 15 mm) were placed in 24-well
plates (the slide covering the entire well). hDF and Saos-2 cells
were seeded on the coated slides at cell densities of 2000 and 10 000
cells/cm2, respectively. As controls, cells were cultured
on TCPS with fresh media for the negative control and wells containing
no cells were used as blank. After the cells were grown on the coated
slides for 24 and 72 h, the cell viability was determined using the
AlamarBlue assay. Media were removed, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and 500 μL of 5% AlamarBlue solution diluted in
nonsupplemented minimum Eagle’s essential medium (MEM) was
added to each well. The well plates were incubated at 37 °C for
1 h protected from light. After incubation, 200 μL of the solution
was transferred to a black well plate. Fluorescence was read using
a microplate reader (Infinite M200) at a wavelength of 560 nm excitation
and 590 nm emission.

The cytocompatibility assay of coated NPs
was tested by growing hDF and Saos-2 cells in a solution with suspended
NPs at different concentrations. hDF and Saos-2 cells were seeded
in 96-well plates at a cell density of 5000 and 20 000 cells/cm2, respectively. After cell seeding for 24 h, the media was
replaced by suspensions of 10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL of NPs in
media. As controls, cells were cultured on TCPS with fresh media for
the negative control and wells containing no cells were used as blank.
After the cells were grown in contact with the NPs for 24 and 72 h,
the cell viability was determined using the AlamarBlue assay. Media
were removed, wells were washed with PBS (the majority of the NPs
were washed out), and 200 μL of 5% AlamarBlue solution diluted
in nonsupplemented MEM was added to each well. The well plates were
incubated, and the fluorescence was read as previously described.

Triplicates were included in each experiment, and the experiment
was repeated three times.

4.4.2 Release of ROS
The release of ROS
when a macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was in contact with NPs was
evaluated because ROS are key signaling molecules induced by acute
inflammatory reactions. The release of ROS was monitored through a
luminol-amplified chemiluminescence assay.16

To a white 96-well plate were added 50 μL of NP suspensions
(10, 100, 1000 μg/mL) together with 50 μL of nonactivated
cells at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/mL. Both
particles and cells were suspended in a protein-free media,16 that is, 4PBS:1DMEM/100 mM glucose. 100 μL
of a luminol solution was dispensed in every well. The luminol solution
(500 μM) was prepared by adding 1% luminol (from a stock solution)
and 0.2% HRP (1 mg/mL) in a 4PBS:1DMEM/100 mM glucose solution. The
luminol stock solution was previously prepared by dissolving 50 mM
luminol(3-aminophthalhydrazide) in 0.2 M NaOH. The controls, without
NPs, consisted of nonactivated cells for the negative control and
cells activated with 1 μM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)
for the positive control. Media alone were used as blank. The well
plate was placed in a microplate reader set at 37 °C. Luminescence
was measured every 2 minutes for a total of 60 min, using an integration
time of 1000 ms and a settle time of 150 ms. To prevent exposure to
light, the experimental procedure was performed in a dark room. Triplicates
were included in each experiment, and the experiment was performed
using three sets of samples.

The relative amount of ROS generated
over the course of the experiment
was approximated by calculating the area under the luminescent curve
using a numerical integration (eq 1). The luminescence signal of every sample was normalized
by the luminescence of the negative control (cell suspension with
no NPs). 1  where t1 and t2 are consecutive measuring times, and f(t1) and t(f2) are the luminescence values at the
respective measuring times.

4.5 Statistics
Statistical analysis was
performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 19 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) using
one-way ANOVA at a significance level of α = 0.05. Scheffe’s
post hoc test was used, and in cases where equal variances could not
be confirmed, Tamhane’s post hoc test was used.

5 Conclusions
ALD has been successfully used to coat
aluminum oxide on glass
slides and NPs of hundreds of nanometers in size. The coating on NPs
was imaged using TEM, and the uniform aluminum oxide layer was proved
using XPS. hDF and Saos-2 were able to grow on aluminum oxide-coated
slides and in the presence of coated NPs. Cell viability was only
compromised by decreasing the particle size to 20 nm and increasing
the concentration of the NPs to 1000 μg/mL, which indicated
that the NP size and concentration played an important role, whereas
aluminum oxide was biocompatible. The release of ROS was shown to
be minimal at concentrations equal to or lower than 100 μg/mL,
indicating a low acute inflammatory response. These results prove
that aluminum oxide coated using the ALD technique does not interfere
negatively with the cellular viability of osteoblasts and fibroblasts
nor activates the release of ROS by macrophages.
