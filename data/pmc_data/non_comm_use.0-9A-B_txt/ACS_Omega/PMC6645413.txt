The
conformational behavior of cyclic monosaccharides has been
widely studied over the past years, but there is no general agreement
about which effects are in fact responsible for the observed conformational
preferences. A recent microwave spectroscopy study determined the
conformational equilibrium of d-glucose in the gas phase
with a preference for a counterclockwise arrangement of the hydroxyl
groups. Nevertheless, the effects that control this orientation are
still uncertain because the role of intramolecular hydrogen bonds
(IHBs), electrostatic and steric repulsions is not clear. This work
reports a density functional theory approach based on the conformational
energies of d-glucose and of some derivatives in which the
anomeric hydroxyl is replaced with hydrogen (H, small and not prone
to participate in proton transfer), fluorine (F, small, electronegative,
and as capable as OH of forming hydrogen bonds as a proton acceptor),
and chlorine (Cl, big and not anticipated to be involved in effective
hydrogen bond formation) to obtain insights into the effects of the
substituent at the anomeric carbon on the arrangement of the hydroxyl
groups in d-glucose. The nature of the substituents at this
position is crucial to determine the orientation of the remaining
hydroxyl groups. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and quantum theory of
atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analyses, in addition to NMR chemical shift
calculations, have been provided to support the conformational energy
outcomes. Overall, the results agree with the lack of IHBs forming
four- and five-membered rings in d-glucose and emphasize
that steric and electrostatic repulsions involving the hydroxyl groups
in the clockwise orientation are driving forces of the conformational
behavior.

1 Introduction
Organic compounds play a fundamental role in biological chemistry
because of their numerous biological properties determined along the
years.1−3 However, the properties of biomolecules, such as
amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, are not limited to biological
functions. Carbohydrates, for example, have specific applications
in materials science in addition to their well-known biological role.4−6 In fact, a huge number of studies have been reported with focus
on the carbohydrate chemistry, and one of the most important topics
highlights the conformational behavior of these molecules.7−10

The importance of the complete understanding of the conformational
behavior of organic molecules is remarkable because the stereochemical
arrangement of atoms in a molecule can deeply affect its macroscopic
features.11,12 In this sense and still regarding carbohydrates,
a number of conformational effects are relevant to account for this
class of compounds. The most remarkable interaction affecting the
stereochemistry of this class of compounds is the anomeric effect,
according to which the α-anomer of a pyranoside ring is surprisingly
stable if only traditional steric effects are taken into consideration.13,14 The gauche effect is also important for the conformational preferences
in cyclic sugars because these systems bear vicinal electronegative
groups that tend to be arranged in a gauche orientation because of
hyperconjugative interactions.15 Nevertheless,
another interesting and controversial conformational finding in d-glucose is the counterclockwise (cc) preference for the orientation
of the hydroxyl groups.

The complete conformational assignment
of d-glucose in
the gas phase has been recently carried out through a microwave spectroscopy
experiment;16 only one out of the seven
conformers found for d-glucose adopts a clockwise (cl) arrangement
of hydroxyl groups. In addition, the authors addressed the conformational
preference for the cc orientation in d-glucose to a cooperative
network of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs), despite the well-known
statement that IHBs forming small rings are weak or even absent.17−19 Since then, some studies have focused on clarifying the actual origin
of this preference. Silla et al.,20 using
a joint analysis of noncovalent interactions (NCI), quantum theory
of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), and natural bond orbital (NBO) theoretical
approaches, described that the cc orientation of the hydroxyl groups
in d-glucose is caused by electron lone pair repulsion involving
the endocyclic oxygen and the anomeric hydroxyl group in the cl conformer.
Both arguments based on IHBs and repulsion in the cl conformation
have been refuted by Lomas and Joubert,21 who established a complexation model of d-glucose with
pyridine (a proton acceptor) and NMR chemical shift calculations to
conclude that cooperativity of IHBs is not full nor absent and that
the interaction with an electron-accepting solvent enhances the IHB
strength.

Therefore, a theoretical approach based primarily
on an analysis
of the structure and conformational energies of d-glucose
and some derivatives, where the OH group at C1 was replaced
with H, F, and Cl, rather than on topological electron density and
NMR chemical shift analyses was carried out to find out the reason
for the cc preference in d-glucose (Figure 1). In this way, an evaluation independent
of NCI methods (which have been demonstrated to be conflicting in
some instances22−24) is provided because only the choice of an accurate
method for geometry optimization and energy calculation is required
to obtain reliable insights into the effects governing the orientation
of hydroxyl groups in d-glucose. The derivative with a H
atom at C1 rather than OH allows evaluation of the absence
of both steric repulsion and a proton transfer group at C1 on the orientation of the remaining hydroxyl groups in the ring;
the fluorinated derivative nearly resembles the d-glucose
molecule in terms of proton acceptance because of the similar size
and electronegativity of fluorine compared to oxygen; and the chlorine
substituent in the chlorinated model provides high steric hindrance,
and it is a weak hydrogen-bond acceptor.25−28 Moreover, an explicit water molecule
was attached to the endocyclic oxygen in order to evaluate the ability
of the latter (O5) in modulating IHBs as a proton acceptor
upon the influence of the former (explicit water).

derivatives studied herein (X = H, F, and Cl).

2 Results and Discussion
The conformational
energies and populations obtained for d-glucose at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ
level in the gas phase (Table 1) are in agreement
with Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy results16 as well as with other theoretical levels reported elsewhere,20 thus validating our density functional theory
calculations for further studies with d-glucose derivatives.
For d-glucose, the α-anomer is the major stereoisomer
as a result of the well-known anomeric effect, while the hydroxyl
groups are mainly oriented in a cc arrangement, with only a single
minor conformer (α_G-g+/cl/g−) exhibiting a cl orientation
for these groups. The controversy lies in the nature of this preferential
orientation, since a chain of cooperative IHBs and electron lone pair
repulsion between O5 and the anomeric OH as the starting
point have been invoked to explain such a behavior. Because of the
difficulty in dissecting the contributions from steric and dipolar
repulsions, the general term repulsion will be often used herein.
A comparison of d-glucose with derivatives bearing anomeric
substituents with different properties relative to the OH group, such
as size, electron-withdrawing character, and proton-donating/proton-accepting
ability, is expected to outline the reasons for the observed pattern.

Replacement of the anomeric OH in d-glucose
with a H atom
significantly changes the conformational preferences of the resulting
compound, which exhibits a cl orientation of the hydroxyl groups at
C2, C3, and C4 as the most stable
conformer (Table 1).
Therefore, the absence of significant steric hindrance at C1 and the lack of a proton donor/acceptor at this position lead to
a shift toward the α_G–g+/cl/g– conformation,
but the question on the origin of the cc orientation in d-glucose still remains unanswered. However, an α-F substituent
suppresses the proton donor ability observed for the OH group at C1, whereas it retains the steric, electrostatic, and proton
acceptor features of the oxygen atom. As a result of considering the
fluorinated derivative, tiny conformational changes are observed when
compared to d-glucose itself, thus indicating that the effect
ruling the significant changes in the H-derivative relates to atomic
size (steric hindrance) and electronegativity (dipolar repulsion)
rather than to IHBs. To better support this finding, the chlorinated
derivative was considered to account for a steric increase relative
to OH. The replacement of OH in d-glucose with Cl reduces
the population of the cl conformation to almost zero, confirming the
hypothesis that lone pair repulsion between O5 and X in
the cl conformation is responsible for the preferred cc orientation
in d-glucose.

An additional model to evaluate the role
of steric effects and
IHBs in the arrangement of the hydroxyl groups in d-glucose
is to consider an explicit water molecule interacting with O5 to inhibit intramolecular interactions (either attractive or repulsive)
involving this atom (see the best positions in Figure 2). Despite the increase in the population
of the cl arrangement, there is an interchange of stability between
cc conformers from α_G–g+/cc/t to α_Tg+/cc/t (Table 1). Thus, it follows
that the effect of a water molecule on the conformational energies
is more related to its preferential mode of interaction with O5 and neighboring atoms through intermolecular hydrogen bonds
than with an attenuation of intramolecular interactions in d-glucose.

Figure 2 Stable conformers of d-glucose optimized at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ
level in the gas phase (upper) and with an explicit water molecule
(lower).

In hyperconjugation-based terms,
IHBs in d-glucose would
be described by nO → σO–H* interactions.
A second-order perturbation analysis of donor–acceptor interactions
in the NBOs shows that, in general, only IHBs forming six-membered
rings (O6H6···O4)
are importantly stabilized (Supporting Information). The picture changes for the α-anomer of the chlorinated
derivative, which exhibits nCl →
σO–H* electron delocalization energies of more than 2 kcal mol–1. An analysis based on the QTAIM supports these findings because
a bond path (a region with high electron density between interacting
atoms) is not observed to form four- and five-membered rings through
OH···O IHBs, but it appears when the formation of a
six-membered ring is possible and it is weaker (but present) for a
OH···Cl interaction in the chlorinated derivative (Figure 3).

Figure 3 QTAIM plots for some
system instances to show (a) a weak OH···Cl
IHB forming a five-membered ring in the G+g–/cc/t conformer
of the chlorinated derivative of α-d-glucose; (b) a
OH···O IHB forming a six-membered ring in the Tg+/cc/t
conformer of the chlorinated derivative of β-d-glucose;
and (c) strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the explicit
water molecule and O5 and H6 of β-d-glucose, forming a seven-membered ring IHB in the G+g–/cc/t
conformer. Included are some geometrical and QTAIM data used to characterize
hydrogen bonds: r in angstroms, ellipticity (the
larger the less stable), q(H) is the atomic charge
(in a.u.) on the hydrogen engaged in the hydrogen bond, and the electron
density ρ between the interacting atoms.

Noteworthy is the exo-anomeric effect in d-glucose
(), which is active when the anomeric hydroxyl
group is cc but is disabled for the cl conformation because of lack
of antiperiplanar symmetry between the electron donor orbital (nO1) and the acceptor antibonding
orbital (Table 2).
Therefore, it is anticipated that the cl conformer should be less
stabilized than cc α-anomers by hyperconjugative interactions.
This is similar to the case of some α-substituted tetrahydropyrans
and piperidines.14 In order to investigate
the role of overall electron delocalization in the conformational
stabilities, an energy-partitioning scheme named NEDA (natural energy
decomposition analysis) was carried out and the contributions from
hyperconjugation and Lewis-type (steric and electrostatic) interactions
to the overall conformational energies through the NBO framework are
given in Table 3. Accordingly,
the G–g+/cl/g– conformer of α-d-glucose
is less stabilized by non-Lewis-type interactions than the remaining
α-anomers, but it is more destabilized because of Lewis-type
interactions than the cc β-anomers. The contributions from steric
and electrostatic effects are more important than stabilization due
to hyperconjugation for the cl conformer (with an explicit water,
this difference is reduced), while these Lewis and non-Lewis contributions
for the other conformers are more competitive. This finding reinforces
the hypothesis that repulsion in the cl conformer explains the preference
for the cc conformation rather than a cooperative chain of IHBs in
the latter.

Lomas and
Joubert21 examined the effect
of the presence of a proton acceptor, pyridine, on the calculated
NMR 1H chemical shifts of d-glucose to probe the
role of IHBs in the orientation of the hydroxyl groups. Surprisingly,
the higher calculated 1H chemical shifts for (O)H1 and (O)H2 in the cl conformer (not in the cc conformers,
whose stabilization has been claimed to be governed by IHBs) relative
to the other conformers (Table 4) suggest that these hydrogens are engaged in IHBs. To better
understand this behavior, the explicit water in our study is anticipated
to reduce the ability of O5 to form an IHB with O1H1 due to the establishment of a strong intermolecular
hydrogen bond O5···H2O. Consequently,
considering the existence of IHBs in free d-glucose, a shielding
effect on the 1H chemical shifts of d-glucose
would appear upon the presence of an explicit water attached to O5. However, δH2, δH3, and δH4 practically do
not vary by moving d-glucose from the free molecule to a
complex with water, whereas δH1 and δH5, in general, increase because of the proximity
with the explicit water, then participating in intermolecular hydrogen
bonds (Table 4). Therefore,
the hypothesis of IHBs forming four- and five-membered rings as driving
interactions of the preferential cc arrangement of hydroxyls in d-glucose cannot be asserted by our NMR-based model as well.

3 Conclusions
Comparison of the conformational
energies for different d-glucose derivatives provided an
unequivocal assessment of the effects
ruling the arrangement of hydroxyl groups in d-glucose. Our
findings support the explanation of Silla et al. that the cc conformation
of d-glucose starts with an O1···O5 repulsive interaction rather than by a network of cooperative
IHBs. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the cl conformation
disables the exo-anomeric effect in d-glucose, yielding a
minimal hyperconjugative stabilization for this conformer compared
to others. In summary, all of these outcomes are instructive because
they suggest that modulation of the structure of d-glucose
derivatives can be carried out by the replacement of hydroxyl with
other groups looking at steric and dipolar hindrance rather than hydrogen
bonds.

4 Computational Methods
d-Glucose
is known to appear experimentally as seven stable
conformers.16 Therefore, the geometries
for each conformer were fully optimized at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level,29−31 and an explicit water molecule was further placed neighboring O5 in order to establish an intermolecular hydrogen bond and
then attenuate intramolecular interactions (steric/electrostatic repulsion,
IHBs, and hyperconjugative interactions) with the endocyclic oxygen
(Figure 2). Frequencies
were checked to guarantee the absence of transition states. The conformers
were named based on the O5–C5–C6–O6, C5–C6–O6–H6 and C2–C1–O1–H1 dihedral angles, according
to the atom numbering provided elsewhere (Figure 1).16 The anomeric
hydroxyl group of d-glucose was replaced with H, F, and Cl,
and the same procedure described above was carried out for these derivatives.
NBO32 and QTAIM33 analyses were additionally performed to check the consistency with
the outcomes from optimization and conformational energy calculations.
Whereas the QTAIM analysis provided topological parameters related
to the electron density along the pathway of interacting atoms, the
NBO method allowed for obtaining hyperconjugative energies and the
contribution from Lewis (repulsive) and non-Lewis-type (electron delocalization)
interactions to the overall electronic energy of the system (Efull = ELewis + Enon-Lewis and ELewis = Esteric + Eelectrostatic). In addition, nuclear magnetic shielding
tensors were computed using the gauge-including atomic orbital method
to investigate the influence of possible IHBs on 1H NMR
chemical shifts.
