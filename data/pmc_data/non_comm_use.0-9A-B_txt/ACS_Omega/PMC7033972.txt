A green composite of organically modified bentonite supported by Co3O4 nanoparticles
(OB/Co) was successfully fabricated and investigated as a potential
eco-friendly, low-cost adsorbent and photocatalyst for promising removal
of both malachite green dye (MG.D) and Cr(VI) ions. The composite
showed high adsorption properties and achieved experimental qmax values of 223 and 139 mg/g for MG.D and
Cr(VI) after equilibration times of 360 min and 480 min for the inspected
contaminants, respectively. The kinetic and
equilibrium inspection reflected the best description of their adsorption
behaviors by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the Langmuir
isotherm model, respectively. This revealed favorable and homogeneous
uptake of both MG.D and Cr(VI) in a monolayer form with theoretical
Langmuir qmax values of 343.6 and 194.5
mg/g, respectively. The theoretical adsorption energies of MG.D (0.6
kJ/mol) and Cr(VI) (0.5 kJ/mol) from the Dubinin–Radushkevich
(D–R) model revealed physisorption properties that might be resulted from some
types of Coulombic attractive forces, achieving theoretical qmax values of 226.5 and 144.6 mg/g, respectively.
The suggested adsorption mechanism was confirmed by the main mathematical
parameters of thermodynamic studies that revealed physical, spontaneous,
and exothermic uptake processes. Also, the composite showed high photocatalytic
performance under visible light, which resulted in a 100% removal percentage of 100 mg/L of MG.D and
Cr(VI) after about 180 and 240 min, respectively, from the adsorption
equilibrium time.

1 Introduction
Decontamination
of both organic and inorganic water pollutants
using natural adsorbents and photocatalysts was endorsed widely as
an effective, cheap, and simple technique.1−3 Among the commonly
detected hazardous organic pollutants, malachite green synthetic dye
(MG.D) was characterized as one of the highly toxic synthetic dyes
that are used extensively in several applications including aquaculture,
food, and medical disinfectants.4,5 Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis,
chromosomal fractures, respiratory toxicity, and teratogenicity are
common diseases recorded for MG.D contaminants.2 Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is one of the reported carcinogenic
inorganic water contaminants, and its safety limit in drinking water
is set to be 5 μg/L.6,7

The previous toxic
impacts attracted the attention of scientific,
health, and environmental authorities to develop promising techniques
to reduce the concentrations of such pollutants in water resources.1 Therefore, great efforts have been made by the
interested researchers to develop advanced materials as single phases
or composites that can be produced by simple methods at low costs
and exhibit high adsorption and photocatalytic activity.2,8−10 Transitional metal oxides and hybrid composites based
on them were addressed extensively as adsorbents and heterogeneous
photocatalysts.11−13 The green fabrication of metal oxide nanoparticles
utilizing the green extracts of plants and vegetables was recommended
strongly to produce environmental materials for remediation applications.14,15 The green fabricated metal oxides have considerably low cost, nontoxicity,
biodegradability, promising surface area, significant surface reactivity,
and high selectivity properties. Moreover, the commonly used green
extracts exhibit strong reducing effects and act as coating agents,
which minimizes the expected agglomeration of the target metal oxides
during the synthesis processes.14,15

Generally, supporting
the metal oxides either by the usual chemical
process or the green methods into suitable carriers enhances the surface
area, adsorption capacity, and recovery properties of such nanoparticles.6,16 Natural layered materials of bentonite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite
were studied as promising catalyst carriers of high physicochemical
features, high natural availability, and low cost.2,17 Bentonite
was studied as one of the best natural catalyst carriers for its low
cost, flexible chemical and crystalline structure, high ion exchange,
promising adsorption properties, and high safety properties.18 It was applied already as a carrier for several
types of photocatalysts including nano-ZnO, Cu2O, CdS,
Ru-TiO2, Ag3PO4, TiO2,
Ni2O3, and Bi2O3.1,19−23 Unfortunately, most of the performed studies focused
on using bentonite as a carrier in its pure phase without further
modifications, which is of lower surface area and adsorption capacity
than its modified products.24

The
modification of bentonite by the different chemical and physical
processes including alkaline treatment, acid leaching, thermal treatment,
polymer intercalation, and organic modifications resulted in hybrid
materials of high basal spacing, high surface area, and high adsorption
capacities and having more active functional groups and high affinity for organic
pollutants.25 Therefore, the introduction
of organo-bentonite (OB) as a carrier for cobalt oxide nanoparticles
can give promising adsorption and photocatalytic results as compared
to the regular use of bentonite or other clay minerals in their pure
phases. The organic modification gives the bentonite higher surface
area and higher adsorption capacity than those of the raw phase especially
for the organic pollutants, which is considered as a vital stage for
effective photocatalytic degradation and reduction processes.26,27 Additionally, the synthesis of cobalt oxide by the green method
can give the composite some technical and environmental values as
it becomes eco-friendly and its particles can be formed with minimum agglomeration
probabilities.

Therefore, the aim of the study is to address,
for the first time,
the application of organically modified bentonite as a carrier for
green fabricated cobalt oxide nanoparticles as a novel green nanocomposite
(organo-bentonite/Co3O4, OB/Co) with enhanced
adsorption and photocatalytic performances for organic malachite green
synthetic dye (MG.D) and inorganic Cr(VI) metal. The adsorption behaviors
and performances were evaluated considering the main affecting parameters
and the controlling mechanisms and taking into account the theoretical
assumptions of the common kinetic and equilibrium models. Moreover,
the photocatalytic properties of organo-bentonite/Co3O4 in the oxidation of MG.D and the reduction of Cr(VI) metals
into Cr(III) ions were studied with a declaration of the main mechanism.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
2.1.1 Structural and Crystalline Properties
The structural
features of bentonite, OB, and OB/Co composite were
examined considering their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure 1). The inspected
pattern of the used raw bentonite showed the dominance of montmorillonite
mineral as the principal phase (Figure 1A). Kaolinite mineral was distinguished as nonswelling
clay impurities in the sample in addition to calcite and quartz minerals
as nonclay impurities. The present montmorillonite was characterized
by its demonstrative XRD peak at about 5.78°, which is the corresponding
peak of the (001) plane in its orthorhombic crystal (ref card
No. 000-003-0010 and No. 00-058-201). Also, other descriptive peaks
were identified at about 6.95, 19.85, 21.54, 26.68, and 28.56°
as insignificant peaks (Figure 1A). Regarding the crystallinity of montmorillonite, it was
formed with 12.71 Å as the basal spacing and 12.96 nm as the
average crystallite size.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of raw bentonite (A), organic modified
bentonite (OB)
(B), and organo-bentonite/Co3O4 composite (OB/Co)
(C).

The synthesis of organo-bentonite
by direct intercalation of its
layer by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (OB) was confirmed
by the XRD analysis (Figure 1B). It displays the reported peaks for the raw bentonite with
noticeable deviation for them from their positions without any detection
of new peaks. The principal peaks were detected at 4.52 and 6.79°
instead of at 5.78 and 6.95°, which were identified in the raw
bentonite sample with a significant increase in its basal spacing
to be 19.52 Å, confirming the successful intercalation process
of montmorillonite layers by the CTAB chains (Figure 1B). The reported augmentation in the basal
spacing of OB is related to the expected orientation of the organic
chains of CTAB within the montmorillonite sheets.

After the
support of OB by green cobalt oxide particles, the XRD
pattern showed two characteristic peaks of cobalt oxide as a Co3O4 phase at about 31.74 and 45.49°, which
are the two theta angles of the (111) and (200) crystallographic planes
(JCPDS No. 42-1467) (Figure 1C). The montmorillonite peaks appeared highly reduced in the
composite, especially the main peaks that disappeared completely in
the sample, which can give strong indications about the precipitation
of cobalt oxide particles on the surface of OB.

2.1.2 Morphological Properties
The surficial
morphological features in addition to the internal structures of bentonite,
OB, and OB/Co composite were studied considering the captured scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, respectively (Figure 2). The used bentonite sample
appeared as well-developed montmorillonite platelets, which were partially
ornamented by minute particles related to the existing nonclay impurities (Figure 2A). The observed montmorillonite platelets
showed flexed forms and displayed the common edge-to-face structural
mode (EF mode), forming a secondary porous matrix of lenticular shape.
Such morphological phenomenon is attributed to the predicted random
agglomeration of the present montmorillonite sheets.19 The HRTEM images showed the characteristic multilayered
structure of bentonite with clear detection of the distinctive lattice
fingers (Figure 2B,C).

supported by green Co3O4 (OB/Co), and (H) and
(I) TEM images of organo-bentonite supported by green Co3O4 (OB/Co).

The integration between
CTAB and bentonite in OB reflected a noticeable
expansion between the bentonite layers and obvious changes in the
external morphology as it appeared as partially rounded particles
of irregular topography (Figure 2D). This was supported by the TEM image, as the organo-bentonite
grains were distinguished as nearly spherical layers arranged regularly
above each other (Figure 2E). The green support of OB by Co3O4 was also confirmed by the SEM and TEM images. The SEM images revealed
the presence of cobalt oxide as fine particles of elliptical to spherical
shapes and were distributed randomly on the surface of OB as decorated
grains (Figure 2F,G).
The TEM images showed the presence of Co3O4 as
random nanoparticles of spherical shape and disseminated on the surface
of organo-bentonite particles (Figure 2H,I). Such morphological properties can give the final
product a high surface area, and the distribution of cobalt oxide
on the surface of OB without agglomeration will provide high exposed properties for it as an active photocatalyst to be of high
interaction properties with the incident light photons.

The
successful integration between bentonite, CTAB, and Co3O4 in a composite (OB/Co) resulted in a considerable
enhancement in the textural properties as compared to the individual
components. The measured surface area increased by 91, 94.8, and 104.6
m2/g for bentonite, OB, and OB/Co, respectively, which
can be related to the expansion of bentonite layers by the CTAB organic
surfactant and surficial distribution of Co3O4 as nano-nudes.

2.1.3 Chemical Functional Groups
The
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the
presence of Al, Si, O, C, and Co as the main components of the composite
(Figure S1). The functional groups of the
composite in comparison with the individual components confirm the
successful combination of bentonite, CTAB, and Co3O4 (Figure S2 Supporting Information).
The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral bands of bentonite,
CTAB, OB, and the OB/Co composite are shown in Figure S2, and the characteristic chemical groups are listed
in Table 1. The bentonite
precursor displayed distinctive absorption bands related to Si–O–Si
groups, OH groups, and Al–O groups, which signify the structure
of clay minerals (Table 1). Also, the used organic surfactant exhibited the representative
bands of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide related to C–H groups, C–N groups, and C–C groups
(Figure S2 and Table 1). The successful intercalation of the addressed
bentonite layers with CTAB chains in organo-bentonite (OB) resulted
in an FT-IR spectrum containing complex bands related to both the
functional groups of bentonite and the functional groups of CTAB (Figure S2 and Table 1). Additionally, there is an obvious fluctuation
in the reported original positions of the main bands of bentonite
and CTAB, which gives a strong indication about the interaction between
bentonite and TAB (Figure S2). Such deviation
was also observed after the support of OB by Co3O4 in addition to the observable identification of the O–Co
bond of Co3O4 (Table 1 and Figure S2).

2.2 Adsorption Results
2.2.1 Effect
of the Main Parameters
2.2.1.1 Effect of pH
Adjusting the pH
value is of vital importance in any studied organic or inorganic adsorption
system as it controls the surface charges of the adsorbents and the
state of the studied dissolved ions as well as the predicted competition
between H+ and OH– on the uptake sites.33 Regarding the speciation of Cr(VI), it exists
in three anionic forms including Cr2O72–, HCrO4–, and CrO42– with dominance for Cr2O72– and HCrO4– in the range from about pH 2 to about
pH 6 and is present as chromate anions at pH values higher than pH
6.2,6

As for the results obtained for the removal
of MG.D, there is a noticeable increment in the achieved removal percentages
from about 24.2% to about 68% with a consistent increase in the adjusted
pH of the solutions from 3 to about 8 (Figure 3A). The adverse behavior was recognized for
the Cr(VI) metal as the removal percentages reflected a continuous
reduction in the values with the systematic augmentation in the pH
value in the same manner from 62.3% (pH 3) to 26.7% (pH 8) (Figure 3A). The recorded
behaviors are in good agreement with other studies introduced for
MG.D as well as the Cr(VI) metal.2,18 The predicted
protonation of the OB/Co surface with a change of the nature of the
medium from acidic to alkaline and the associated saturation of it
by negative charges make the composite exhibit high attractive properties for positive
ions (MG dye) and high repulsion properties for negative ions (Cr(VI)).33 Such explanation was supported by the measured
pH (PZC) of OB/Co, which is 6.32, and this reflected the dominance
of the positive charges at pH values lower than 6.32 and the negative
charges at pH values higher than 6.32.

parameters on the adsorption of the
MG dye and Cr(VI) metals: (A) solution pH, (B) contact time, (C) OB/Co
masses, and (D) initial concentrations of the examined pollutants.

2.2.1.2 Effect of Time
Detection of the
equilibrium uptake time as the best time for the investigated adsorbents
is of critical commercial value. For MG.D as well as the Cr(VI) metal,
the curves displayed two different adsorption stages of different
uptake rates (Figure 3B). This appeared in the rapid changes of the adsorbed quantity with
the systematic expansion in the interaction time, representing the
first stage (Figure 3B). This stage was followed by another stage, which appeared as a
plateau curve with slight changes in MG.D and Cr(VI) metal adsorbed
quantities, reflecting the
realization of their equilibrium states (Figure 3B). Such trends were reported in the literature
and explained by the continuous occupation of OB/Co-active sites by
MG.D molecules and the Cr(VI) metal until the whole occupation of the existing
sites.34,35 The experimental equilibrium intervals for
MG.D and Cr(VI) metal were accomplished after 360 min and 480 min,
respectively, realizing uptake capacities of 124 and 93.5 mg/g, respectively
(Figure 3B).

2.2.1.3 Adsorbent Dosage
The possible
augmentation in the decontamination of MG.D and Cr metals considering
the increase in the OB/Co masses was addressed and is displayed in Figure 3C. From the figure,
it was observed that the decontamination percentages of MG.D were
expanded by 52.3, 68.7, 90.3, 85.3, 96.4, and 99.4% on increasing
the incorporated OB/Co masses by 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3
g, respectively (Figure 3C). As for Cr(VI) ions, their decontamination by the OB/Co composite
showed a significant increase by 35.5, 50.4, 63.5, 75.2, 84.4, and
90.7% with a systematic increment in OB/Co masses from the previous
values (Figure 3C).
The noticeable improvement in the decontamination percentages with
the higher masses of the composite was associated with the predicted
increase in the exposed surface area of OB/Co as well as the reacting
active sites.36

2.2.1.4 Initial
Concentrations
The systematic
evaluation of the adsorption capacity of OB/Co for MG.D and Cr metals
using different concentrations plays a principal role in detecting
the experimental maximum saturation capacity and gives an effective
contribution in understanding the controlling mechanism. This was
accomplished considering the studied concentration from 50 mg/L to
about 300 mg/L, and the results are emphasized graphically in Figure 3D. The two curves
reflected the ability of OB/Co to adsorb more of MG.D molecules and
Cr(VI) metal with persistent increment in the used concentrations
until the full occupation of the receptor sites at a certain concentration,
representing the equilibrium concentration (Figure 3D). The experiment equilibrium for MG.D was
reached after using a concentration of 250 mg/L, achieving 223 mg/g
as the maximum experimental adsorption capacity (Figure 3D). For Cr(VI), the equilibration
concentration was 225 mg/L and 139 mg/g was realized as the maximum
capacity. Moreover, the MG.D and Cr(VI) curves are L-type (2 L) isotherm
curves that are associated with adsorbents of very high affinity to
the target pollutants.37,38

2.2.2 Kinetics
and Equilibrium Properties
2.2.2.1 Kinetic Behavior
Regarding the
kinetic behavior of the OB/Co system, the linear fitting of the uptake
results of MG.D and Cr(VI) metal with the four reported theoretical
models is emphasized in Figure 4A–C. The fitting results and the calculated theoretical
mathematical parameters revealed excellent agreement with the hypothesis
of the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and pseudo-second-order model,
achieving a high correlation coefficient close to unity either for
MG.D or for the Cr(VI) metal with obvious preference for the pseudo-first-order
model (Table 2). Such
fitting results suggested a dominant physisorption mechanism associated
with the influence of some chemical effects that can include complexion or ion exchange
processes.2,39 The good fitness with the Elovich model
for the two pollutants supported the previously suggested explanation
of the adsorption behaviors and also reflected the energetic heterogeneous
nature of OB/Co during the adsorption reactions8 (Figure S3 and Table 2).

pseudo-first-order model (A), the pseudo-second-order
model (B), the intraparticle diffusion model (C), the Langmuir model

isotherm model (F).

For the inspection of the intraparticle
diffusion assumption, the
curves plotted for MG.D and Cr(VI) metal demonstrated several adsorption
divisions without passing by the original points, i.e., there is more
than one mechanism controlling the uptake by OB/Co rather than the
possible diffusion of the studied ions6 (Figure 4C). The
curves displayed three segments: The first one can be assigned to
the external adsorption by the surficial receptor sites of OB/Co composites.
The second segment is related to the layer adsorption stage that has
limited intraparticle diffusion rate. After the formation of thick
adsorbed MG.D and Cr(VI) layers on OB/Co by molecular association
and interionic attraction mechanisms, the diffusion rate decreases
gradually, forming the third adsorption segment that reflects the
saturation or equilibration stage.40

2.2.2.2 Equilibrium Behavior
The equilibrium
behavior for OB/Co adsorption systems was followed considering the
assumptions of Langmuir (Figure 4D), Freundlich (Figure 4E), and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models
(Figure 4F). The Langmuir
model is a commonly addressed model to designate uptake processes
of the monolayer form that occur homogeneously by the reacting sites
of the surface of the adsorbent.41 On the
other hand, the Freundlich model can be applied to signify the adsorption
mechanisms of the multilayer form and heterogeneous type.35,42 The linearly mathematical fitting showed excellent correlation coefficient
values with the Langmuir model rather than the Freundlich model, suggesting
the homogenous uptake of MG.D and Cr metal by OB/Co in the monolayer
form (Table 2). Their RL parameters revealed favorable uptake by the
composite and the regular increase in their calculated values with
the investigated concentrations related to the high experimental uptake
capacities at the higher concentrations43 (Table 2). Also,
based on the theoretical Langmuir-related parameters, the OB/Co composite
can achieve 343.6 and 194.5 mg/g as theoretical maximum capacities
for MG.D and Cr metal, respectively (Table 2).

Moreover, the Dubinin–Radushkevich
(D–R) model was studied to predict the principal operating
mechanisms (physical or chemical) during the uptake of MG.D and Cr
metal by the OB/Co composite considering the Gaussian energy distribution.44 The accomplished results of MG.D and Cr metal
are in excellent
agreement with the D–R model, and its related parameters displayed
226.5 and 144.6 mg/g as the theoretical uptake capacities of MG.D
and Cr metal, respectively (Table 2). The calculated adsorption energies of MG.D and Cr
metal are 0.6 and 0.5 kJ/mol, respectively, which imply physisorption
properties of OB/Co for MG.D and Cr metal (Table 2). The obtained results from the D–R
model and the kinetic model suggested ion exchange processes that
might involve weak electrostatic attraction (Coulombic attractive
forces) without destruction and/or formation of chemical bonds.41 As the adsorption results are in better agreement
with the D–R model as compared to the Langmuir model, the theoretical qmax values obtained by the D–R model
are the most appropriate values.

2.2.3 Thermodynamic
Properties
The thermodynamic
properties of the OB/Co adsorption system for MG.D and Cr metal were
inspected considering different values for the reaction temperature.
The results emphasized detectable declination in their removal capacities
with a regular increase in the adsorption temperature from 298 K (132
mg/g (MG.D) and 105 mg/g (Cr metal)) to 333 K (85.6 mg/g (MG.D) and
70.8 mg/g (Cr metal)), revealing their exothermic adsorption by OB/Co2 (Figure 5A). The Gibbs free energy values (ΔG°) at the different studied adsorption temperatures were calculated
using eq 1 and are listed
in Table 2(40) 1  All of the theoretical estimated ΔG°
values are lower than 20 kJ/mol and of negative
signs, which is a strong indication of their physisorption with spontaneous
and favorable properties35,45 (Table 2). The reported increment in the ΔG° values with the organized increase in temperature
reflected linear declination in the favorable properties of the reaction
the controlled expanding in the temperature.45

Figure 5 Uptake
capacities of OB/Co for MG.D and Cr metal at different operating
temperatures (A) and Van’t Hoff plot for the uptake results
(B).

The enthalpy (ΔH°) and the entropy
(ΔS°) were calculated from the linear
fitting of the accomplished results with the Van’t Hoff equation (eq 2; Figure 5B, Table 2).46 2  The obtained enthalpies
of MG.D and Cr metal
are of negative signs, which are related to the exothermic reactions
and their values established the physisorption mechanisms for the
studied contaminants2,47 (Table 2). Additionally, the positive signs that
were observed for the entropy (ΔS°) signified
the high affinity of OB/Co for them and suggested a significant increase
in randomness possibilities during the uptake reactions48 (Table 2).

2.2.4 Comparison Study
To investigate
the uptake properties of synthetic OB/Co as compared to the commonly
studied adsorbents, its theoretical and experimental maximum capacities
were compared with the reported values for other adsorbents in the
published literature (Table 3). The presented results reflected the preferences for using
OB/Co as an adsorbent, which is represented by its high uptake capacities
for MG.D and Cr metal as compared to most of the presented natural
and synthetic adsorbents involving pure bentonite, diatomite, clay
minerals, organoclays, some metal oxides in pure phases or as composites,
some polymers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene oxide. Therefore, the
synthetic OB/Co composite can be introduced as a green, low-cost,
and eco-friendly adsorbent of high adsorption affinities for both
synthetic organic dyes and heavy metals.

2.3 Photocatalytic Properties
The photocatalytic
behavior of the OB/Co composite was studied for the oxidation and
photoreduction of 100 mg/L MG.D and Cr(VI) metals, respectively (Figure 6). These were accomplished
after the adsorption/desorption of the composite for both of the studied
contaminants and continued for 240 min under visible light. The results
reflected that the maximum removal percentages of MG.D and Cr metal
by OB/Co after the equilibration were about 62 and 47%, respectively
(Figure 6). Under visible
light illumination, the catalytic activity of OB/Co as a potential
photocatalyst resulted in systematic removal of MG.D as oxidized products
by 68.5, 80, 91.4, 96.3, 98.5, and 100% after time intervals of 30,
60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min, respectively, i.e., the complete removal
of MG.D (100 mg/L) can be accomplished after 180 min of photocatalytic
degradation considering the adsorption equilibrium as the start point
(Figure 6).

Figure 6 Photocatalytic
properties of OB/Co in visible light degradation
of MG.D as well as Cr metal Cr(VI).

Regarding the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by OB/Co, the
photoreduction percentages increased by 55.4, 64.5, 73.4, 81.5, 89.2,
95.4, 98.2, and 100% for examined intervals of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,
180, 210, and 240 min, respectively (Figure 6). Achieving the complete removal of Cr metal
by its photoreduction into Cr(III) was attained after 240 min considering
the adsorption equilibrium stage as the starting time. The previous
results give the synthetic composite (OB/Co) high technical and commercial
value as products of different removal mechanism
either its high adsorption properties or its effective photocatalytic
properties.

2.4 Reusability Studies
Reusing the composites
in a series of tests of selected adsorption and photocatalytic decontamination
of MG.D and Cr metal to inspect their stability values, their reusability
was assessed for five runs (Figure 7). The synthetic composite demonstrated a high stability
value, which signifies that it is a suitable product for five decontamination
cycles. For photocatalytic oxidation of MG.D, the achieved reusable
removal percentages are 100, 97.3, 94.5, 89.2, and 85.4% for Run1,
Run2, Run3, Run4, and Run5, respectively (Figure 7). For the recognized photocatalytic reduction
for the studied Cr(VI) metal in the aqueous solution, the acquired
reduction percentages are 100, 98.2, 95.7, 91.5, and 87.4%, respectively.
Such results can be enhanced using higher quantities than 0.05 g of
OB/Co as the catalyst dose (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Reusability results of OB/Co as a photocatalyst and as
an adsorbent
material in the decontamination of MG.D and Cr metal.

As for reusability results for adsorption, the synthetic
OB/Co
composite shows high adsorption stability and the achieved percentages
for the reusability test of MG.D are 99.8, 96.4, 91.2, 85.3, and 77.4%,
respectively, for the five
runs (Figure 7). For
Cr(VI), the attained percentages are 90.7, 88.3, 84.2, 78.3, and 71.3%
(Figure 7). The OB/Co
composite as the adsorbent can realize higher decontamination efficiencies
for more reusability tests with an increase in the removal time and
the incorporated masses.

2.5 Effect of Integration and
Mechanism
To examine the influence
of the combination process creating a hybrid material of enhanced
properties, the adsorption as well as the photocatalytic decontamination
of MG.D and Cr metal was studied utilizing the composite (OB/Co) and compared with the individual
components bentonite (B), organo-bentonite (OB), and cobalt oxide
(Co) (Figure S4). This was accomplished
after fixing the time at 240 min, the mass of the studied materials
at 0.05 g, the pollutant concentration at 100 mg/L, the aqueous volume
at 100 mL, the pH at 6, and the temperature at 30 °C. The adsorption
percentages of MG.D by B, OB, Co, and OB/Co are 12.6, 20.5, 9.7, and
52.3%, respectively (Figure S4). This reflected
enhancement in the adsorption capacity of OB/Co by 39.7, 31.8, and
42.6% as compared to the individual components B, OB, and Co, respectively.
This was also observed for Cr(VI), and the uptake percentages for
B, OB, Co, and OB/Co are 9.42, 16.7, 7.4, and 35.5%, respectively.
i.e., the value increased by 26, 18.8, and 28% higher than the results
achieved by B, OB, and Co, respectively (Figure S4).

The used pure bentonite (B) and organo-bentonite
(OB) showed no photocatalytic properties and no improvement in the
achieved decontamination percentages of MG.D and Cr metal. However,
the pure phase of Co3O4 (Co) and OB/Co showed
significant photocatalytic properties both in the oxidation of MG.D
and the reduction of Cr metals (Figure S4). The accomplished decontamination percentages by Co and OB/Co
are 38.5 and 100% for MG.D and 43.6 and 100% for the Cr metal, respectively.
This reflected considerable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance
of OB/Co by 61.5% for MG.D and 56.4% for the Cr(VI) metal in comparison
with the green fabricated Co3O4 nanoparticles
as a single phase.

The concluded enhancement in both the adsorption
and the photocatalytic
performances after supporting the Co3O4 nanoparticles
with the organically modified bentonite might be ascribed to (a) the
excellent adsorption performance of bentonite and its organic modified
product, (b) the effect of the combination process, providing different
types of active functional groups, (c) the distribution of Co3O4 homogenously over the surface of OB without
agglomeration, resulting in strong impact on enhancing the total surface
area, and (d) provide
high exposed properties for the present active photocatalyst, which
provide high chances for the interaction between the OB/Co and the
incident photons.1,78−80

As recognized
in numerous literature studies, the photocatalytic
oxidation or reduction process involves three main steps in the presence
of light source. First, the addressed dissolved pollutants should
be adsorbed by the used catalyst followed by the absorption of the
light incident photons as the second stage. After that, charge transfer
occurs, forming various types of oxidizing and reducing species.1,8 The production of the composite involves the intercalation of bentonite
layers by CTAB chains, producing organically modified bentonite (OB)
of high basal spacing and surface area and different types of functional
groups that provide more chances for the attraction of the tested
pollutants (Figure 8A,B). Afterward, the green decoration of the synthetic OB by Co3O4 nanoparticles results in the formation of nanograins
of cobalt oxide distributed on the surface of OB without agglomeration,
which can add other functional groups that contribute toward increasing
the adsorption capacity (Figure 8C). The distribution of Co3O4 as separated grains on OB provides high chances for light interaction
and to attract more MG.D molecules and Cr metals close to the active
catalytic sites (Figure 8D).

Figure 8 Schematic figures for the preparations of organically modified
bentonite (OB) (A and B), the loading of green Co3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of OB forming the OB/Co composite
(C), the enhanced adsorption of MG.D and Cr metal by the OB/Co composite
(D), and the photocatalytic degradation and reduction mechanisms of
MG.D and Cr metal, respectively (E).

The interaction between OB/Co and light photons is associated with
considerable excitation of cobalt oxide electrons to the conducting
band, creating electron/hole pairs and other species of oxidizing
as well as reducing radicals81 (Figure 8E). Thus, the oxidation
of MG.D might be related to the electron/hole pairs or the generated
hydroxyl or superoxide radicals.1,82

The reduction
of Cr(VI) metal might be accomplished by the produced
reluctant species from (a) the captured electrons during the excitation
process, (b) the effect of the photogenerated O2•– in lowering the valence state of Cr(VI), and (c) the electron transfer
effect between the OB/Co surface and the attracted Cr metals.81,83 The illustrative equations of MG.D photocatalytic degradation and
Cr(VI) photoreduction can be represented as follows (eqs 3–11) 3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11  

3 Conclusions
Organo-bentonite/Co3O4 (OB/Co) nanoparticles,
a green nanocomposite, achieved experimental qmax of about 223 mg/g and Langmuir theoretical qmax of about 343.6 mg/g for MG.D; while the experimental qmax and Langmuir theoretical qmax values for Cr(VI) are 139 and 194.5 mg/g, respectively.
The adsorption results of both contaminants are described excellently
by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm
model. This reflected their favorable and homogeneous uptake in a
monolayer form by physisorption mechanisms with 0.6 kJ/mol (MG.D)
and 0.5 kJ/mol (Cr(VI)) adsorption energies and with D–R theoretical qmax values of 226.5 and 144.6 mg/g, respectively.
The thermodynamic parameters revealed physical, spontaneous, and exothermic
uptake of MG.D and Cr(VI) metal. Also, the composite showed high photocatalytic
performance under visible light, which appeared in complete oxidation
and reduction of 100 mg/L of MG.D and Cr metal after about 180 and
240 min, respectively.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The used natural bentonite
samples were raw samples collected from local bentonite quarry, Northern
Western Desert, Egypt. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma Aldrich
(CTAB, 99%)) was incorporated during the organic modification of the
bentonite sample. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate of analytical grade and
of >98% purity (Sigma Aldrich, Egypt) was used in the production
of
Co3O4 oxide. NaOH scales and HCl dilute solution
were supplied by El-Nasr Chemical Company and were used as pH modifiers.

4.2 Synthesis of Organo-bentonite
The
fabrication of organically modified bentonite was accomplished by
direct intercalation of bentonite layers by CTAB chains. The studied
bentonite powder (2 g) was ground and dispersed homogeneously within
100 mL of distilled water and stirred at 500 rpm for 2 h. After that,
1 g of the CTAB surfactant was dissolved within 50 mL of distilled
water, and then, the resulted mixture was stirred for another 30 min
to confirm its complete dissolution. Then, the prepared surfactant
solution was mixed with the bentonite suspension and the mixture was
stirred for 24 h at 70 °C. Finally, the solid fractions were
separated using a centrifuge, washed extensively five times with distilled
water, and dried in an electric oven at 80 °C for about 12 h.

4.3 Green Fabrication of Organo-bentonite/Cobalt
Oxide (OB/Co) Composite
First, the reducing reagent was extracted
from green tea by boiling 5 g of it in 100 mL of distilled water for
5 min and 100 mL of the resulting extract was kept to be used in the
formation of cobalt oxide. Furthermore, 3 g of the prepared organo-bentonite
was dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water under ultrasonic irradiation
for 60 min. Then, 50 mL of an aqueous solution containing about 2.5
g of dissolved cobalt nitrate hexahydrate was mixed with the organo-bentonite
suspension under stirring for another 60 min at 500 rpm. After that,
the green tea extract was mixed with this under stirring and the mixture
was left at room temperature for 48 h to confirm the successful loading
of organo-bentonite by nano cobalt oxide. Finally, the solid fractions
were separated using the centrifuge, washed, and dried for 10 h at
60 °C.

4.4 Characterization Techniques
The crystalline
phases were identified considering the X-ray diffraction patterns
that were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer of PANalytical (Empyrean)
type. The surface morphology and the internal features were investigated
based on SEM and HRTEM images obtained utilizing a scanning electron
microscope (Gemini, Zeiss-Ultra 55) and a transmission electron microscope
(JEOL-JEM2100), respectively. The change in the functional groups
was followed based on the obtained absorption bands of FT-IR spectra
using an FT-IR Raman spectrometer (Vertex 70). The optical properties
of the OB/CO composite were examined within a light range from 200
nm to about 800 nm by a Shimadzu-M160 PC UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The textural properties including the surface area and pore size distribution
were estimated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method
and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, respectively.

4.5 Adsorption System
The adsorption
properties of the OB/Co composite for MG.D and Cr(VI) metals were
evaluated using a UV–vis spectrophotometer and inductively
coupled plasma, respectively. The experiment was repeated three times, and the obtained results
are the average values with standard deviations lower than 5.4% for
MG.D and 3.8% for Cr(VI) metals.

4.5.1 Effect of pH
Addressing the influence
of adsorption pH on the affinity of OB/Co for MG.D and Cr metals was
accomplished at various pH values from 2 to 8. The other affecting
factors were fixed at 0.05 g of OB/Co mass, 100 mL of polluted solution
volume, 100 mg/L as the contaminant concentration, 30 °C temperature,
and 240 min as the studied time interval.

4.5.2 Effect
of Time and Kinetic Studies
The influence of time and the
related kinetic behavior were inspected
with a time range from about 5 min to about 720 min after fixing the
controlling factors at 0.05 g of OB/Co mass, 100 mL of polluted solution
volume, 100 mg/L as contaminant concentration, 30 °C temperature,
and pH 6. The kinetic properties of OB/Co adsorption systems were
evaluated considering the assumptions of three theoretical models
(pseudo-first-order kinetic model, Lagergren pseudo-second-order model,
Elovich model, and intraparticle diffusion model) by linear regression
fitting with their representative equations eqs 12–15, respectively. 12   13   14   15  

4.5.3 Effect of OB/Co Mass
The possible
enhancement in the removal percentages of certain concentrations of
the studied contaminants with incorporation of higher quantities of
OB/Co was investigated within a range from 0.05 to 0.3 g after fixing
the controlling factors at 100 mL of polluted solution volume, 100
mg/L as contaminant concentration, 240 min as time, 30 °C temperature,
and pH 6.

4.5.4 Equilibrium Studies
The effect
of increasing the initial concentrations of the studied contaminants
on the uptake capacity as well as the equilibrium behaviors was addressed
for different concentrations within the experimental range from 50
to 300 mg/L. The additional affecting factors were fixed at 0.05 g
as OB/Co mass, 100 mL of the polluted solution as the treated volume,
100 mg/L as the contaminant concentration, 30 °C temperature,
and 480 as the studied time interval. The equilibrium behaviors were
evaluated based on the results of the linear regression fitting with
different theoretical isotherm models including Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Dubinin–Radushkevich models, and their representative equations
are eqs 16–18, respectively.2 16   17   18  

4.5.5 Thermodynamic Properties
The thermodynamic
properties of the OB/Co-based adsorption system for MG.D and Cr metal
were studied considering the reaction temperature from 298 to 333
K. The other affecting factors were fixed at 0.05 g as OB/Co mass,
100 mL of the polluted solution volume, 100 mg/L as contaminant concentration,
and 720 min as the studied time interval.

4.6 Photocatalytic Studies
The photocatalytic
properties of OB/Co in visible light decontamination of MG.D and Cr(VI)
metals at 100 mg/L concentration were studied using a metal halide
lamp (400 W) with 490 nm average wavelength. All tests were conducted
after attending the adsorption/desorption equilibrium of MG.D and
Cr(VI) within time intervals from 30 to 240 min using 0.05 g of OB/Co as the photocatalyst
mass at pH 6 and 30 °C as temperature.

4.7 Reusability
Study
The suitability
of using OB/Co for several runs of MG.D and Cr(VI) removal either
as an adsorbent or as a photocatalyst is a vital factor for its realistic
use on a commercial scale. OB/Co (0.05 and 0.3 g) for the adsorption
and photocatalytic reusability tests, respectively, was mixed with
100 mL of contaminated solutions (100 mg/L) for 240 min at pH 6 and
room temperature. By the end of each cycle, the solid fractions were
isolated, washed by distilled water, and dried to be used in the other
cycles.
