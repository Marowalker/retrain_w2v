In
this study, the effect of chemical surface functionalization
through oxidation of exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets in the transport
properties of their aqueous nanofluids has been analyzed. With this
objective, thermal conductivity and viscoelastic properties have been
determined for original and oxidized nanoplatelets. The results show
that the functionalization completely changes the internal structure
of the suspension, which is reflected in shifts of even orders of
magnitude on viscosity, yield stress, or storage or loss moduli. It
is evident that this influences thermal conduction properties as well,
as it has been also demonstrated. This shows that nanostructure surface
functionalization can be a useful strategy to tune nanofluid thermophysical
properties.

Introduction
The use of graphene nanoplatelets to produce
nanofluids (NFs hereafter),
nanometric-scale particle colloidal dispersions, has been recently
proposed, and the studies published so far suggest that their performance
as technical fluids in different industrial applications is promising.
Although a relatively emerging topic, the number of concerned papers
published is remarkable, and some reviews have been already published,
as for instance, those by Rasheed et al.1 or Sadeghinezhad et al.2 The addition
of graphene nanoplatelets to a base fluid has been proposed to improve
lubrication conditions3,4 or to enhance the heat-transfer
properties of a base fluid.5,6 This use of graphene
can be regarded as a particular path within the active field of NF
characterization, where the use of nanostructures of very different
nature has been tested, and this includes a variety of carbon allotropes,
such as nanotubes,7 either single-8 or multiwalled,9 graphite,10 graphene,11 or graphene
oxide.12

Despite the considerable
number of studies related with NFs (some
recent reviews as those of Murshed and de Castro13 or Eggers and Kabelac14 are
representative of the current status of the field), many critical
questions are a matter of open debate. The original motivations for
these studies were the supposed enhanced heat-conducting properties
of these suspensions, with unexpectedly huge reported experimental
heat conductivities that exceeded sometimes by more than 1 order of
magnitude of the expected values. Despite the fact that it was later
demonstrated that this enhancement was not as fabulous as declared,
this initial impulse attracted attention of other NF properties, as
for instance, viscosity, rheological behavior, heat capacity, etc.,
which also exhibit unexpected and nonclassical trends. The broadening
of the scope of research has brought interesting insights that are
unveiling amazing physics leading to many practical applications.15 It is worth saying that nowadays the interest
on NF research goes much further than the determination of their still
intriguing heat-transfer properties.

Concerning the use of graphene
in this context, its presentation16 is
the first issue and undoubtedly a crucial
one. Obtaining dispersed single-layer nanosheets is difficult to achieve
due to aggregation, and often the suspended material consists actually
of exfoliated graphite nanoparticles (xGnPs),17,18 whose use is very convenient for its price and ease of preparation
and handling. As with other nanoparticles, the stability of the suspensions
obtained is generally poor. If water is used as base fluid, the stability
of xGnP is reduced, and it is improved when other fluids, such as
ethylene glycol,19,20 are used as dispersing medium.
The use of xGnP produces interesting effects on the base fluid viscosity
trends, and it has been shown19 that non-Newtonian
behavior appears even at low charge loads, showing shear thinning
and dynamic yield stress. This is the result of a remarkable structure
within the colloid. An estimation of the fractal dimension of the
aggregates in that case results in the conclusion that a reaction-limited
chain aggregation (RLCA)-type aggregation process occurs. This imposes
serious limitations to the practical use of these working fluids in
any application, including fluid flow, as viscosity may vary over
a range of several orders of magnitude, reaching a surprising “solidlike”
plastic behavior that may completely hinder flow.

A feasible
option to control xGnP NF stability and aggregation
is the tuning of interface properties between the carbon and the base
fluid, and this can be achieved by the chemical modification of the
carbon surface by either the chemical functionalization of the surface
or the induction of chemical bonding. In particular, oxidation reactions
have been used frequently, obtained by different techniques.21−24 In a previous work,25 a mild oxidation
pathway was used to obtain oxidized xGnP (named xGOnP). Nitric acid
was then used, varying the process conditions, which strongly reacts
with the aromatic carbon structures, producing oxygenated functional
groups, such as carboxyl and ketones.26 The resulting nanoparticles were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), X-ray spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, and the morphology
was studied by electron microscopy. The stability in water in this
case was much better than that for the original xGnP, and this NF
electrical conductivity was determined, finding that the conditions
of the surface functionalization could be used as a route to tune
this property, enabling a controlled tailoring of the suspension conditions.

Now, an analysis of the influence of surface treatment on the thermal
conductivity and rheological properties of the NF obtained using again
water as base fluid is the objective. The so-called transient hot-wire
method is one of the most widely used techniques for determining fluid
thermal conductivity.27,28 In the case of nanofluids, ease
of use and the relative accuracy of this technique have made it very
popular, and most of the published scientific papers on the characterization
of nanofluid thermal conductivity use this experimental technique.29−31 The shear viscosity of the NFs obtained from the original Newtonian
base fluids may have a Newton shell and a shear shell, depending on
a number of factors. Some of them are the material, size, shape, and
concentration of nanoparticles as well as the type of liquid base.
Structured fluids such as colloidal gels, microgel suspensions, dense
suspensions, concentrated emulsions, and foams are viscoplastic deformation
fluids, and the trend of the viscoelastic properties provides useful
information to determine the nature of the interactions. In this case,
it will be discussed if the surface functionalization of the xGnP
can be used to design new working fluids with a thermophysical profile
adapted to the particular needs of a given application.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
The complete characterization of the
xGOnP using electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been presented in an earlier
publication.25 Summarizing this characterization, Figure 1 presents a sketch
of the morphological model for the oxidized nanoplatelets. A small
section of a platelet is presented, small enough to show the main
characteristics, which can be extended in the plane and combined in
several layers to compose a randomly chosen real xGOnP. As a result
of the oxidation process, epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups are
attached to the NP surface. The surface density of these groups can
be determined by changing the oxydation process conditions and adequately
quantified by the described characterization techniques. This process
produces as first results an improvement of the stability in polar
base fluids, such as water. In addition, in a previous work,25 it was shown that the effect of this surface
functionalization on the electrical conductivity of aqueous suspensions
was very remarkable. It was observed that xGOnP produces an increase
in the NF electric conductivity, as the oxidized moieties dissociate
showing a weak acid behavior. This implies that the oxidation process
can be used to control the NF electrical conductivity. The effect
of this oxidation process on other thermophysical properties has not
been studied in detail yet, but it can be used as a method to tailor
NF thermophysical properties.

Figure 1 Scheme of a small graphene monolayer showing
the main feature in
xGOnP: structure flexibility, loss of aromaticity in substitution
sites, and the presence of oxygen (red circles) containing functional
groups, such as epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl.

The stability of xGnP/H2O and xGOnP/H2O NFs was evaluated using a Helios
Omega UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated
cell carrier at different sonication times for further determination
of the ζ potential, as described in a previous work.25 The stability of xGnP/H2O samples
is clearly worse, needing higher sonication times, but in any case,
it is enough in all cases to ensure sample stability during the performed
experimental runs.

Thermal Conductivity
The results
obtained for xGOnP
and xGnP NFs show that the thermal conductivity increases with concentration.
The improvement in thermal conductivity (κnf/κ0) vs concentration is shown in Figure 2. Table 1 shows the weight and volume fractions of xGnP and
xGOnP for all concentrations at a temperature of 293.15 K, showing
the thermal conductivity measured for each case. In this case, the
improvement in the thermal conductivity of the xGOnP samples must
be underlined, as the difference of the slope with volume concentration
is very remarkable compared to the original xGnP NF. The use of surfactants
or stabilizers is very common to improve the stability of NFs. This
is important for the evaluation of their performance in practical
applications, but the use of these additives produces a shift in the
NF thermophysical properties, and so, for characterization purposes,
the use of surfactants adds an extra variable to be kept in mind.
For example, Selvam et al.32 measured the
thermal conductivity of water- and ethylene glycol-based xGnP NFs
obtained using sodium deoxycholate as dispersing agent. A comparison
of their experimental data reveals that the thermal conductivity of
their water NFs is slightly lower than that of the samples studied
in this work, and the difference can be attributed in this case to
the use of the surfactant.

The comparison of thermal
conductivity values of other aqueous
graphene NFs is not straightforward as many variables are involved
in the sample preparation. Nevertheless, the presented data agree
well with other recent references, and for instance, Ahammed et al.33 reported a 16.04% enhancement in κ value
for xGnP/H2O NF at 0.1% in volume fraction, whereas our
experimental value corresponds to a 18.42% enhancement. For the case
of xGOnP/H2O NF, Hajjar et al.34 reported a 15.25% enhancement in κ at 0.1% weight concentration,
whereas our experimental value corresponds to a 17.23% enhancement.

Nonlinear Viscoelastic Measurements
Figure 3 shows shear viscosity (η)
as a function of shear rate (γ̇), usually referred to
as flow curves, of H2O and three different weight fractions
of xGnP/H2O and xGOnP/H2O NFs (1, 2, 3 and 0.1,
0.5, 1 wt %, respectively). H2O is a Newtonian fluid, but
both NFs show shear thinning with yield stress even at very low concentrations,
which represents a non-Newtonian behavior, as shear viscosity decreases
with the applied shear rate. As concentration increases, a Newtonian
plateau appears in the lowest γ̇ region, and the shear
thinning is more pronounced due to the stronger sheet–sheet
and multisheet interactions with the increase in concentration. Shear
thinning of well-dispersed suspensions is related with modifications
in the structure and arrangement of interacting particles. Shearing
may cause the particles to orient in the direction of flow and its
gradient, breaking agglomerates and reducing the amount of immobilized
solvent. Interaction forces then decrease, thereby decreasing also
the flow resistance and the apparent viscosity of the system. A comparison
of the viscosity trends shows that the oxidation process produces
an increase in viscosity, especially in the low-shear region, of up
to 3 orders of magnitude.

Certain non-Newtonian materials exhibit the so-called yield
stress,
absorbing when shearing starts stress energy without flowing, until
the yield stress threshold is exceeded and then deformation occurs.
This observed behavior can be associated with the reorientation of
exfoliated graphite nanosheets at high shear rates. According to this
short-range order, these materials behave as solids when the local
shear is below the yield stress, but once it is exceeded, flow occurs
with a nonlinear stress–strain relationship.

The yield
stress value for a certain fluid can be obtained as an
extrapolation of the shear stress value at zero shear rate, but the
ideal rheological models with yield stress present two limitations.
First, there is a singularity for viscosity when the strain is zero,
and, in some cases, the viscosity function is not activated in the
limit of zero strain rate. Papanastasiou35 proposed a model to overcome the limitation due to the uniqueness
of the viscosity for γ → 0 by proposing an exponential
regularization for the term of the creep stress of the Bingham model.36 The same idea has subsequently been used with
the Herschel–Bulkley model.37 This
model describes in a single equation the creep and noncreep zones
and allows the determination of yield stress σy 1  Figure 4 shows the experimental shear
stress vs shear rate of xGnP/H2O and xGOnP/H2O NFs at different concentrations
(0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3% by weight for xGnP and 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
and 1% for xGOnP) and their fit with the Papanastasiou model. The
dynamic yield stress values obtained from this fit are shown in Table 2. These values increase
nearly exponentially with weight fraction. At the same weight fraction
(1 wt %), xGOnP NFs show a dynamic yield stress 2 orders of magnitude
higher, evidencing an internal structure that is completely different
(and stronger) from the case of original xGnP NFs.

Linear Viscoelastic Measurements
Strain
Sweep Tests
Oscillatory or dynamic experiments
were then performed to determine the viscoelastic behavior. This way,
stress can be separated into its elastic and viscous contributions,
obtaining the elastic or storage modulus, G′,
and the viscous or loss modulus, G″, plotted
in Figure 5. First,
strain sweep tests at constant ω = 10 rad·s–1 were carried out to identify the linear viscoelastic region (LVR)
in the strain range of 0.1–1000%. The linear regime, where G′ and G″ are independent
of strain amplitude, is then determined. G′
decreases monotonically as strain increases, whereas G″ goes through a maximum. This means that when an external
strain is imposed, the structure of both NFs resists the deformation
up to the critical strain value, where G″
increases; then, the structure is lost by the disaggregation of nanoparticles
and the sample flows, decreasing both G′ and G″. The moduli of both G′
and G″ at the same weight fraction for xGOnP
are 4 orders of magnitude larger than those for xGnP, again evidencing
a much stronger structure. This remarkable difference can be attributed
to the existence of a more complex structure of aggregates network
in the xGOnP nanofluids, as will be discussed later.

Stress–strain curves can also be plotted, as it has
been
done for xGOnP NFs in Figure 6. The deviation from linearity in this plot allows the determination
of static yield stress and critical strain values listed in Table 3. Static yield stress
values increase linearly (in logarithmic scale) with volume fraction,
and critical strain values decrease linearly with volume fraction.

Analysis of the Fractal Dimension
An analysis of the
dependence of G′ on the volume fraction is
useful to discuss the fluid internal structure. Colloidal gels are
formed by particle aggregation and show viscoelasticity; their behavior
with the volume fraction is governed by the fractal nature of the
colloidal flocks. The gel network is considered to be a collection
of fractal flocks closely packed throughout the sample. Shih et al.38 developed a scaling model relating G′ and the critical strain to the particle volume fraction
for a colloidal gel far from the gelation threshold.

The fractal
dimension, or Hausdorff dimension, is a generalization of the dimension
of a real vector space (Euclidean or topological dimension) based
on the local measurement of a set. Fractal sets of points typically
show noninteger Hausdorff dimensions because of the scale invariance
of their geometric structure, extending the concept of line, plane,
and volume to objects of arbitrary dimension between them. The analysis
of fractal dimension of the aggregates helps to obtain valuable information
about their structure: first of all, it provides a picture of some
aspects of the geometry, if it is ordered in linear chains, planes,
or three-dimensional flocks, and their relative density, but at the
same time allows identifying the aggregation mechanism. Then, according
to Shih et al.,38 the fractal dimension
of the aggregates can be calculated using the relation between yield
stress (Y) and the nanoparticles volume fraction
(ϕ) in the suspension 2  where α is a coefficient depending
on
ζ potential and the interparticle average distance and m is related to the fractal dimension of the flocculated
network (Df) as 3  where X and d are, respectively, the aggregate backbone
dimension of the whole
system and the Euclidean dimension of the system (in this case, d = 3). The dimension values obtained allowed to analyze
the type of aggregation and structure properties. The relations between
molar volume and yield stress are represented in Figure 7 for both xGnP and xGOnP NFs.
These experimental data were fitted to eq 2, obtaining m = 2.80 ±
0.08 for xGnP and m = 3.25 ± 0.14 for xGOnP.
These values yield fractal dimensions Df(xGnP) = 1.23 and Df(xGOnP) = 1.46 when we consider the backbone dimension to be X = 2.

Figure 7 Static yield stress (Y) as a function of volume
fraction ϕ for both xGnP (A) and xGOnP (B) NFs. Experimental
data (●) were fitted to eq 2, obtaining the solid lines.

The fractal dimension found previously19 for xGnP/EG considering X = 2 was 2.36,
one unity
larger than the value considering H2O as base fluid. To
explain this discrepancy, it is convenient to take into consideration
the values of Df for all possible backbone
dimensions. Consequently, supplementary calculations were done, obtaining Df(xGnP) (1) = 1.57, Df(xGOnP) (1) = 1.77 for X =
1, Df(xGnP) (3) = 0.86, and Df(xGOnP) (3) = 1.15 for X = 3. All of them are represented in Figure 8 and compared to reference values. Although
three-dimensional backbone is hardly assumable, the corresponding
values were also included for completeness.

Figure 8 Fractal dimension of
aggregates (Df) as a function of supposed
backbone dimension (X). ■ correspond to xGnP/EG,19 ●
to xGnP/H2O, and ▲ to xGOnP/H2O. Df characteristic values of pure liquid, RLCA,
and diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) are included for
reference.

The calculated values of Df considering X = 1 or 2 lay
between 1 and 2, corresponding to a structure
between a line and a plane. For X = 1, these values
are close to 1.8 (especially for the case of xGOnP), which is the
characteristic dimension of diffusion-limited cluster aggregation
(DLCA). This result is clearly opposed to the results obtained for
xGnP/EG,19 which were much closer to 2.3,
corresponding in that case to a reaction-limited cluster aggregation
(RLCA) process. Results independent of the backbone dimension considered
strongly suggest that the aggregation present is of the RLCA type,
building compact structures with effective dimension greater than
2. Moreover, the high value obtained for n is also
characteristic of this aggregation scheme.

The large difference
observed in the fractal dimensions of xGnP
between the present study and the previous one may be explained directly
by the relation between particle–particle and particle–solvent
forces, due to the organic behavior of EG in contrast with the polar
character of H2O. In the case of xGnP/EG, the fractal dimension
was found to be between a plane and a solid. Solvent tends to dilute
the aggregates because of their hydrophobic surface as well as the
solvent character, and as a consequence, the resulting structure will
be sparse and complex. Due to the lack of resistance of the solvent
to the extension of the planar particles, their conformation is mainly
entropy-driven, allowing for a two-dimensional network backbone. H2O, on the other hand, tends to repel graphene nanoparticles
due its characteristic polar nature. More spherical and closed structures
are expected to form driven by H2O repulsion, behaving
much more like micelles than small sheets. The aggregates network
will present a dynamic behavior resembling DLCA, typical of chainlike
or dendritic aggregates of spherical beads. The relation between intermolecular
forces explains also the larger values of fractal dimension in oxidized
nanoparticles. The increase in the number of polar moieties in the
surface of xGOnP with respect to xGnP decreases their average hydrophobic
character, enhancing solubility in water and allowing for a more complex
and developed structure of aggregates network.

Frequency
Sweep Tests
Finally, frequency sweep tests
were carried out in the LVR, with angular frequencies ranging from
0.1 to 400 rad·s–1 and a constant strain value
of 0.1%. The experimental data of storage and loss moduli are shown
in Figure 9. For these
NFs, the storage modulus exceeds the loss modulus, G′ > G″, especially for higher concentrations,
and G′ values are practically constant in
the whole frequency range in both cases, indicating a typical gel
structure and the dominant elastic nature of the material under these
conditions. For the case of xGnP, both moduli increase with concentration
at a given constant frequency. In addition, they increase slightly
with frequency beyond an approximate value of 10 rad·s–1. These results must be underlined because the addition of nanoparticles
produces, even at low concentrations and frequencies, a continuous
transition toward elastic behavior. On the other hand, for the case
of xGOnP, both moduli are constant within the frequency range studied,
showing a clear solidlike behavior. Both G′
and G″ are now, if compared to the previous
case, and for the same concentration, 4 orders of magnitude higher,
which underlines the dramatic behavior change produced by the nanosheets
oxidation. This means that rheological studies of its viscoelastic
nature are essential to determine its potential practical use for
any technical application.

The experimental data
for G′ at low frequencies
can be modeled as a function of concentration according to a percolation
expression as follows39 4  where A and B are constants and ϕ0 is the threshold
volume fraction,
and the equation can be applied only near the percolation threshold.

Experimental data measured at low frequency (10 rad·s–1) were fitted to eq 4, leaving as adjustable parameters the concentration
at the threshold (ϕ0) and the parameters A and B. For NFs, a linear relation has
been obtained between the logarithm of the storage modulus G′ and the volume fraction. As shown in Figure 10, the experimental
data are adequately represented by eq 4, from which a close-to-zero critical concentration
is determined for both cases. Therefore, these experiments have been
performed at concentrations that are well beyond the percolation threshold
and can be easily classified as gels. For these exfoliated graphite
NFs, the van der Waals interactions are so strong that induce large
structures even at very low concentrations.

Conclusions
The important effect
of oxidation on exfoliated graphite platelets
NF thermal conductivity has to be emphasized because the trend against
volume fraction concentration changes remarkably when comparing with
the original xGnP/H2O NF. Higher conductivity values are
obtained with lower nanoparticle loads, an important feature for their
practical applications. The difference in dry sintered nanosheet density
produces that the same weight fraction produces an effective lower
volume fraction for the case of xGOnP NF, showing a remarkable thermal
conductivity enhancement compared to the equivalent volume fraction
for the xGnP case.

The non-Newtonian nature of xGnP/H2O and xGOnP/H2O NFs is evident, showing shear thinning
and dynamic yield
stress. All samples show viscoplastic nature suggesting that a combination
of particle aggregation and shape effects is the mechanism for its
high-shear rheological behavior, which is also supported by the thermal
conductivity measurements. G′ decreases after
a certain critical strain, and G″ presents
an overshoot phenomenon.

Strain sweep tests show that structural
interactions within xGOnP
NFs are remarkably much stronger than in the case of nonoxidized nanoplatelets,
yielding loss and elastic moduli 4 orders of magnitude higher. This
change in the internal structure of the NF caused by the surface functionalization
process has to be highlighted.

As a continuation of these tests,
the aggregates fractal dimension Df has been calculated, obtaining
a value very close to the characteristic DLCA theory value, especially
for the xGOnP case. This value is characteristic of chainlike or dendritic
aggregates. The increase of surface-adsorbed oxygen-containing functional
groups for the case of xGOnP decreases nanosheet hydrophobicity, enhancing
solubility and thus allowing a more complex and developed aggregates
structure. Frequency sweep tests confirm the cited stronger internal
structure in the case of xGOnP NFs. In addition, the close-to-zero
critical concentration values determined for both cases evidence that
even for xGnP interparticle interactions are so intense that produce
a well-defined structure even at very low concentrations.

The
objective of this work is the evaluation of graphene surface
functionalization through oxidation as a tool to tailor the derived
NF thermal profile as industrial working fluid. The final conclusion
is that the effects of this functionalization can be regarded as somewhat
contradictory. Although thermal conductivity is clearly enhanced and
can be tuned by adjusting the surface chemical treatment, the viscoelastic
behavior of the samples changes, producing higher viscosity due to
the evident changes in the NF internal structure. These changes are
induced by the different aggregation processes occurring in the case
of xGnP and xGOnP nanoplatelets. The competition of these two factors
has to be carefully taken into account for practical purposes as tailoring
an NF to increase thermal conductivity without evaluating other properties,
as the rheological profile may induce an incomplete evaluation of
the working fluid potential performance.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Materials
Exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets
(xGnPs) grade C were supplied by XG Sciences, Inc. The declared surface
area is approximately 750 mm2·g–1, and the nominal flake thickness is 1–5 nm. Nitric acid (HNO3, analytical grade) was supplied by Aldrich (99%). Aqueous
solutions were prepared with Milli-Q-grade water. Exfoliated graphite
oxide nanosheets (xGOnPs) were synthesized from xGnP through reaction
with nitric acid, as detailed in a previous work.25 Using these nanoplatelets, homogeneous and stable suspensions
of xGnP/H2O and xGOnP/H2O were prepared. The
nanopowder was weighed using a Mettler AE-240 electronic balance with
an accuracy of 5 × 10–5 g and then dispersed
into a predetermined volume of the base fluid to obtain the desired
weight fraction of up to 1 wt %, and the particles were dispersed
using an ultrasonic bath (Clifton, 80 W). The stability of the suspensions
prepared using different sonication times was evaluated using an Agilent
HP 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer.

The thermal conductivity
of the samples has been determined by a device based on transient
hot-wire technology at 293.15 K for concentrations up to 1% by weight
using a Decagon-compatible KD2 thermal conductivity meter. This device
is based on the transient hot-wire technology,40 which is widely used in the field of NFs because it minimizes
the problems of natural convection and the influence of the conductive
final effects and presents a reduced measurement time, much lower
than the characteristic sedimentation times. Further details regarding
the measurement procedure can be found in previous works.41,42 Despite the fact that this device is widely used for NF measurements,
the limitations of the technique must be kept in mind. In a recent
paper, Antoniadis et al.43 have presented
a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the use of this technique
for the case of biphasic systems obtained from the dispersion of nanometer-sized
material in a fluid medium. The conclusions of the authors reveal
some reasons that offer insight into the often surprising scattering
observed in NF experimental thermal conductivity. Their conclusions
lead to the presentation of a number of recommendations necessary
to maximize data reliability. The use of double-wire probes is recommended
to avoid boundary effects at the ends of the heating wire, and also
the diameter of the wires should be lower than 30 μm. These
two conditions are not fulfilled by the probe used in this case, but
the other two recommendations (temperature rise values below 4 K and
the use of insulated wires) have been respected. The device calibration
performed for the base fluid yielded accurate results for the base
fluid, and the result is that the thermal conductivity value determined
for pure water is very accurate (κexp (293 K) = 0.59920
W·m–1·K–1), whereas
the NIST Chemistry Webbook44 recommended
value is κNIST (293 K) = 0.59846 W·m–1·K–1. Concerning the NF thermal conductivity
values in the Results and Discussion section,
the obtained data are compared to other recent references.

Rheological
properties were determined using a Physica MCR 101
rheometer (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) equipped with a cone-plate geometry
(CP 25-1) with a constant gap of 0.048 mm, allowing to control torques
between 0.5 μN·m and 125 mN·m and normal force from
0.1 to 30 N. Different series of experiments were carried out to investigate
the NF rheological behavior, following the procedure used previously
for the characterization of other NFs.19,45,46 Nonlinear viscoelastic experiments, or flow curves,
were first determined, where shear viscosity variation with a shear
rate of up to 10 000 s–1 is measured. Then,
linear viscoelastic measurements followed, where the linear viscoelastic
regime (LVR) was determined by measuring store (G′)and loss (G″) moduli in the strain
range of 0.01–1000% at a constant angular frequency of 10 rad·s–1, different weight fractions of up to 20 wt %, and
293.15 K. Frequency sweep measurements were also carried out from
0.1 to 600 rad·s–1 by applying a strain of
0.1% at different concentrations and 293.15 K.
