The study presents the comparative bioelectrochemical
treatment
of phenol in anodic and cathodic compartments of four identical dual
chambered microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with bare and multiwalled carbon
nanotube/polypyrrole (MWCNT/PPy)-coated electrodes, respectively.
It was observed that systems performing biocathodic treatment of phenol
performed better as compared to the systems performing bioanodic treatment.
The maximum power densities for bioanodic phenol treatment using bare
and coated electrodes were found to be 469.038 and 560.719 mW/m2, while for biocathodic treatment, they were observed to be
604.804 and 650.557 mW/m2, respectively. The MFCs performing
biocathodic treatment of phenol consistently showed higher chemical
oxygen demand removal efficiency, Coulombic efficiency, and power
density and indicated the better performance of the biocathodic bare
(B-MFC) and coated (C-MFC) MFCs as compared to the bioanodic B-MFC
and C-MFC. UV/vis spectrophotometry revealed that the MWCNT/PPy-coated
carbon paper worked significantly better in the treatment of phenol
with admirable treatment obtained within a week of the experiment
as compared to the system with bare carbon paper. Cyclic voltammetry
asserted better electrochemical activity of the MFC systems with coated
electrodes in the treatment of phenol. The electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy data also supported the better performance of biocathodic
phenol treatment with lower internal and charge transfer resistances.
The scanning electron microscopy images confirmed the active biofilm
formation on the electrode surface. The study indicates MFC as a viable
option for the treatment of recalcitrant chemical compounds with energy
recovery.

1 Introduction
Waste management is one
of the major environmental concerns the
world is facing at present. Different industries like chemical and
petroleum produce a wide variety of wastes that have the cumulative
effect in polluting the environment. Aromatic organic compounds are
frequently observed as a common constituent present in the effluents
from these industries. These organic compounds represent a group of
potentially hazardous compounds that can impart serious health concerns.
These organic compounds often present difficulty in treatment because
of their complex nature and affect all life forms alike when discharged
untreated. It is therefore crucial to treat these aromatic contaminants
into biodegradable and less toxic compounds before discharging off
into the water bodies.

Phenols are environmental pollutants
that find their way into water
bodies from various sources. Phenol is released in effluents from
industries like coal gasification, oil refineries, paper and pulp,
pharmacy, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, and other chemicals.1,2 They have been listed under the category of priority pollutants
by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as they can be harmful
to living organisms even at low concentrations.3 Their exposure can be hazardous to human health as it may
lead to respiratory problems, irritation to the eyes and mucous membrane
with their long-term exposure may even lead to cancer.4 Ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption of phenol may
even lead to fatality in severe cases.5 Studies have suggested that phenols tend to inhibit microbial activity
at concentrations higher than 5.5 mg/L. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has regulated phenol concentration of 1 μg/L in drinking
water.5 Thus, it is of utmost importance
to treat the wastewater contaminated with phenol properly before being
discharged into water bodies. Conventional methods of treatment like
solvent extraction, chemical oxidation, ion exchange, and physical
adsorption have been widely used to treat wastewater contaminated
with phenol but these methods present the limitations of high cost,
low efficiency, and harmful byproduct generation.3

Recently, bioelectrochemical systems have proved
to be efficient
technology in the treatment of toxic pollutants at no extra treatment
cost. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a category of bioelectrochemical
systems that treats the organic contaminant under the action of microorganisms
acting as catalysts and generates bioenergy in the form of electrical
power.6 MFC, thus, is considered a promising
technology for harvesting green energy and clean water by treating
waste coming from industries. Various types of organic wastes have
been successfully treated with MFC technology like leachates,7 dyes,8,9 and chlorophenols.10 Multiple studies have reported the treatment
of phenol in a MFC under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions but
no study currently compares the treatment of phenol under anaerobic
(bioanodic) and aerobic (biocathodic) conditions of MFC and presents
an overall performance under different external conditions.1,3,4

Even though the MFC is a
remarkable environmentally friendly technology,
the power output from the system is still too low for practical application
of the technology notably because of the restrained interaction between
the microbial community and the electrode thereby limiting the electron
transfer.11 Different factors affect the
performance of the MFC by interfering with the biofilm and electrode
interaction, among which the electrode materials have been noted to
play a significant role12 as the rate of
electron transfer between the electrode and biofilm interface formed,
playing a critical role in the current and power output of MFC is
largely governed by the conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility
of the electrode involved.13 Carbon materials
like carbon paper, cloth, and felt are the most widely used electrode
materials in the MFC because of their low cost, admirable electrical
conductivity, biocompatibility, noncorrosiveness, and chemical stability;14 however, they show low electrocatalytic activity
for the electrode microbial growth.15 For
the improved power output, different researchers have focussed on
both cathodic and anodic modification, however, many researchers consider
the anode to be a limiting factor for high power generation as it
directly influences bacterial growth and the rate of electron transfer
between the anode and microbes,15 making
it a prime focus to improve the morphological and chemical properties
of the bioanodes. Thus, a high performing anode material with excellent
conductivity, high surface to volume ratio, and high microbial affinity
with economic stability is essentially the main approach for the improved
cell performance. While designing and fabricating a new anode, the
two crucial points to be considered are high stability and performance
of the synthesized electrode with better porosity to achieve higher
bacterial adhesion to the surface thus improving the exoelectrogenic
electron transfer.11,16 Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), since
their discovery by Ijiima et al. in 1991, have been the center of
attention and are recently receiving considerable interest in the
fabrication of electrodes because of their unique properties like
high thermal and electrical conductivity, high surface to volume ratio,
superior mechanical strength, and light weightedness.17,18 However, CNTs can be toxic and inhibit cell growth therefore CNTs
are incorporated with other compounds to modify their properties.19 Conducting polymers like polyaniline (PANI)
and polypyrrole (PPy) due their conductive, biocompatible, and stable
nature have recently been incorporated in CNTs to obtain new nanocomposites
with enhanced properties and used for electrode modification.20 The hybrid nanocomposites with unique features
of individual components like better mechanical strength and high
surface area to volume ratio from CNTs and biocompatibility and stability
from polypyrrole can substantially improve the biofilm–electrode
interaction on the synthesized electrode thus improving the MFC output.21 Zou et al. (2008) synthesized the CNT/polypyrrole
nanocomposites, studied the
performance of the MFC utilizing glucose as the substrate, and reported
that the performance of the MFC system improved when the coated electrode
was used as an anode as compared to the bare carbon paper.19 Mishra et al. (2016) coated the multiwalled
CNTs manganese oxide/polypyrrole (MWCNT-MnO2/PPy) nanocomposite
on carbon cloth and observed that the performance of the MFC in terms
of power density (PD) was improved dramatically.15

The focus of the present study is to demonstrate
the performance
of the MFC in treating higher concentrations of phenol anaerobically
and aerobically in dual-chambered MFCs. Most of the works previously
performed using MWCNT/PPy nanocomposite-coated electrodes have employed
simple carbon sources. Zou et al. (2008) used glucose as the substrate
while utilizing CNT/PPy-modified carbon paper electrode, whereas Roh
and Woo (2015) used a lactate-enriched carbon source while using the
carbon felt electrode.19,22 However, in practical application
the waste is seldom composed of simple carbon sources and is more
likely to be composed of toxic, recalcitrant compounds. The novelty
of this study lies in its comparative analysis of toxic phenol waste
under varying environmental conditions and studying the impact of
the MWCNT/PPy-coated electrode on MFC performance. The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the successful coating and effective
biofilm formation on the electrodes. The study further presents the
effect of the nanocomposite-coated electrode on the performance of
MFC treating phenol. Electrochemical behavior of phenol treating MFC
with coated and bare electrodes has also been compared and substantial
results in terms of PD and Coulombic efficiency (CE) have been drawn.

2 Results
2.1 Characterization of the Synthesized Nanocomposite
Using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction
Spectroscopy
To confirm the synthesis of MWCNT/PPy nanocomposites,
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the synthesized
material was performed. Figure 1a shows the FTIR spectra of the functionalized MWCNT, PPy,
and MWCNT/PPy nanocomposites. For, functionalized MWCNT, the characteristic
bands were observed at 1034, 1392, 1626, 1742, and 3438 cm–1 corresponding to the C–O stretching, C=C stretching,
and C=O stretching vibration of the −COOH group which
is displayed as a result of acid treatment and −OH stretching,
respectively.23 For PPy, the fundamental
asymmetric and symmetric ring vibrations were obtained at 1550 and
1468 cm–1, −C–H in-plane vibrations
as can be seen in the graph were obtained at 1300 and 1042 cm–1, and −C–H out-of-plane vibration at
912 cm–1 with a C–N stretching peak observed
at 1188 cm–1. The spectrum of MWCNT/PPy showed the
characteristic PPY and MWCNT peaks with a small shift as a result
of the interaction between PPY and MWCNT nanocomposites. The PPY peak
in MWCNT/PPy appeared at 896 cm–1 attributed to
−C–H out-of-plane deformation, 1038 and 1300 cm–1 for −C–H in-plane deformation, 1302
cm–1 for C–N stretching with a characteristic
pyrrole ring symmetric and asymmetric peak at 1462 and 1546 cm–1, respectively.19,24

and MWCNT/PPy nanocomposites.

Figure 1b shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) plot that reveals diffraction patterns
of functionalized nanotubes, PPy and the synthesized nanocomposite.
At the 2θ values of 25.55 and 42.75°, two well-resolved
diffraction peaks were observed in the XRD plot of the functionalized
MWCNT. A single broad peak of PPy at 22.75° justifies its amorphous
nature. The XRD sequence of the MWCNT/PPy nanocomposite reveals the
characteristic peaks of MWCNTs (at 25.8 and 43.4°). However,
PPy inclusion to MWCNT marginally decreased the intensity and broadened
the diffraction peaks, which could be an indication of the reduced
crystallinity of the CNTs as also suggested by Ghasemi et al. (2015).20,25 The change in the diffraction peak indicates the successful synthesis
of the nanocomposites.

2.2 Bioelectricity Generation and Cell Voltage
Profile of MFCs Treating Phenol
The energy recovery in terms
of output voltage was recorded for all four MFCs treating the phenol
under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. Experimental
results revealed that the treatment of phenol under different conditions
in the MFC could generate different electric outputs. The graphs of
the voltage (mV) plotted across time (h) at different phenolic concentrations
have been presented in Supporting Information, Figure S1a,b. For the bioanodic and biocathodic (bare MFC) B-MFC
systems, after the acclimation period, the first experimental concentration
was introduced and an immediate voltage output of 85 and 87 mV was
recorded for bioanodic and biocathodic B-MFC, respectively. Both the
MFCs displayed a significant difference in the performance in terms
of voltage generation. From the plot it can be observed that biocathodic
B-MFC performed better in terms of voltage recovery as compared to
the bioanodic B-MFC. As soon as a drop to around 100 mV in the voltage
was recorded with the exhaustion of the substrate, a fresh feed of
glucose (co-substrate) was added into the system. The peaks appearing
in the graph signifies the fresh feed of glucose to the reactor. The
peak voltage output was observed to be 664 mV for bioanodic B-MFC
while for biocathodic B-MFC the maximum voltage output was recorded
to be 754 mV. The highest voltage recovery for both the setups was
recorded for the 200 mg/L phenol batch. It was also observed that
the voltage output declined as the phenol concentration amplified
for both the reactors. This decrease in the voltage recovery could
be linked to the rising toxicity of phenol that inhibited the performance
of the microbial community present in the reactors. Similar observations
reporting the retarded performance of the MFC in the presence of high
concentrations of toxicants have also been presented by other research
groups.26 The performance of the biocathodic
B-MFC in terms of energy recovery was nearly 14% higher as compared
to the bioanodic B-MFC representing that the MFC performed better
when toxicants like phenol are present in the aerobic chamber. Different
environmental conditions (anaerobic and aerobic) provided could have
also resulted in the dissimilitude between the performances of the
two reactors. The lower voltage recovery in the case of the bioanodic
B-MFC can possibly be related to either the toxic effect of phenol
on the anaerobic community leading to decreased electron generation
or because of the utilization of the produced electrons in the reduction
of phenol thus lowering the overall electron availability at the anode
and hence the performance.27 In the biocathodic
B-MFC on the other hand, the electron recovery is more prominent as
the toxic phenol is present in the cathodic chamber thereby not affecting
the anaerobic microbial community degrading the substrate to release
electrons. These recovered electrons travel through the circuit to
the cathodic chamber to be accepted by the terminal electron acceptor,
thus generating higher electric output.

2.3 Power Generation and Wastewater Treatment
Efficiencies
Electric power was used as an important parameter
in monitoring the long term performance of the system. Organic removal
was also monitored throughout the study in terms of chemical oxygen
demand (COD) removal efficiency. The highest PDs for the systems treating
phenolic wastewater using bare electrodes were calculated to be 469.038
and 604.804 mW/m2 for the bioanodic B-MFC and biocathodic
B-MFC, respectively. The peak in the PD curve was observed every time
a fresh cycle of glucose (co-substrate) was introduced into the system,
and a sink in the PD represents the consumption of the available substrate
by the microbial community. A lower PD is observed in the case of
bioanodic B-MFC contrary to the biocathodic B-MFC, which suggested
that the electrons generated in the anodic chamber could have dissipated
by the phenol present in the same chamber for its reduction thereby
acting as an electron acceptor and reducing the availability of electrons
at the electrode to flow across the circuit that eventually results
in lowering the PD of the bioanodic B-MFC. Alternatively, in the case
of the biocathodic B-MFC, as phenol is present in the cathodic chamber,
a greater flux of electrons is produced in the anodic chamber flow
through the circuit, thus producing a higher power output. The performance
of both the systems decreased as the concentration of the phenol in
the system increased which can be a manifestation of the toxic effect
of phenol on the microbial community present thus retarding the overall
performance.

Further, a comparative analysis of phenol treatment
using a MWCNT/PPy nanocomposite-coated anode was also performed and
the power recovery was better for the MFCs utilizing coated anodes
under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The highest PDs achieved
for coated anodes performing bioanodic and biocathodic treatment are
560.719 and 650.557 mW/m2, respectively, which could be
because of the better electron transfer between the microbial community
and anode as also suggested by Zou et al. (2008).19 A similar pattern of diminished performance with increasing
concentration was followed by the MFCs utilizing coated electrodes
which again shows that phenol toxicity affected the overall performance
of the system.

The efficiencies of all the systems in treating
the wastewater
were estimated in terms of COD removal efficiency. For both the setups,
the phenolic concentration of 200 mg/L displayed the highest COD removal
efficiencies of 77.24 and 82.17% for bioanodic and biocathodic B-MFC,
respectively. The highest PD achieved in affiliation with the COD
indicates that the energy output was achieved at the expense of COD
removal. It was observed during the study that the performance of
the biocathodic B-MFC was better as compared to the bioanodic B-MFC
throughout the span of the study. Figure 2a,b presents the PD generated and COD removal
efficiency achieved using bare carbon paper electrodes during the
study. In comparison to the B-MFCs, the systems utilizing nanocomposite-coated
electrodes (C-MFCs) performed excellently with admirable treatment
achieved within a week of operation with the highest COD removal efficiencies
of 80.548 and 82.169% for the bioanodic C-MFC and biocathodic C-MFC. Figure 2c,d presents the
performance of the electrode-modified MFC at the best performing phenolic
concentration of 200 mg/L.

(a,b) at different
phenol concentrations in bioanodic and biocathodic B-MFCs and (c,d)
bare and coated anode at 200 mg/L concentration.

2.4 CE Observed during Phenolic Treatment in the
MFC
The output energy efficiency of the MFC systems was estimated
in terms of the CE. At a phenolic concentration of 200 mg/L, the 24
h CE was observed to be maximum and it was found to be 2.220 and 2.315%
for bioanodic and biocathodic B-MFCs, respectively. The performance
in terms of the CE decreased with the increase in the concentration
of phenol indicating the toxic effect of phenol on the microbial community,
thereby affecting the performances of both the setups.28 The lower CE could also be due to the lower
surface to volume ratio that also affected the microbial biofilm growth
in the system, thus further affecting the performance of the MFC.29 The consistently lower performance of the bioanodic
B-MFC as compared to the biocathodic B-MFC also suggests that the
toxic nature of phenol present in the anodic chamber affects the production
of electrons thereby affecting the CE and MFC performance. Figure 3a presents the CE
of bioanodic and biocathodic B-MFCs, respectively. The comparatively
low PDs and CEs could be the result of a lower surface area to volume
ratio of the system as has also been reported by Penteado et al. (2018).30

Figure 3 CE for (a) anaerobically and aerobically treated phenol
at different
concentrations and (b) bare and modified electrode at a phenol concentration
of 200 mg/L.

The comparative analysis of the bare and MWCNT/PPy-modified
electrode
revealed the enhanced CE in the case of nanocomposite-modified systems,
however, it was demonstrated from the results obtained that the biocathodic
C-MFC still performed better as compared to the bioanodic C-MFC. Figure 3b presents the comparative
CEs of B-MFCs and C-MFCs at the best performing phenolic concentration
of 200 mg/L. As can be seen from the graph, the highest CEs for bioanodic
and biocathodic C-MFCs were 2.87 and 3.03%, respectively.

2.5 UV/Visible Analysis of Phenol
UV/vis
spectroscopy was conducted to investigate the phenol treatment efficiency
of the four MFCs by scanning the effluent sample in the wavelength
range of 200–700 nm. Figure S2a–d (Supporting Information) shows the UV/vis spectra for bioanodic
and biocathodic B-MFCs and bioanodic and biocathodic C-MFCs, respectively,
treating 200 mg/L of phenol. A characteristic absorption peak for
phenol was observed at 270 nm.31 The highest
intensity was observed on the first day of the experiment as can be
seen in the graph, and the decrease in absorbance with time indicates
the degradation of phenol.

The comparative study of the MFCs
utilizing a bare and coated anode revealed that the treatment of phenol
was quickly performed (within a week) for C-MFCs as compared to the
B-MFCs (15 days) indicating that the anode coating improved the treatment
efficiency greatly which could be because of the better assimilation
of the substrate to produce electrons.

2.6 Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectrometry Analyses for Observation of Bacterial Adhesion
The SEM imaging was performed to confirm the growth of the microbial
community in all the systems treating phenol with coated and bare
electrodes and it attested to the presence of microbial communities
in all the systems (Figure 4a–f). However, the type and dominance of the microbial
community varied widely for coated and bare electrodes with mainly
the spherical community dominating when bare anodes were used. Contrarily,
in the case of the systems using MWCNT/PPy-coated electrodes, the
microbial community majorly present was rod-shaped as observed from
SEM images. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry revealed the elemental
composition of bare and MWCNT/PPy-coated electrodes and the sludge
treating the systems. It was observed to be nearly similar for all
the systems with the elemental dominance of Na, K, Al, Zn, Fe, Mg,
and Si in the sludge from the micronutrients added (Figure S3).

nanocomposite-coated carbon paper and (e,f) bioanodic and biocathodic
C-MFC carbon paper anodes coated with MWCNT/PPy, respectively.

2.7 Electrochemical Analysis Using Cyclic Voltammetry
and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
To reveal the
biocatalytic activity of the anodic biofilm in the four MFCs, cyclic
voltammetry (CV) was performed and the voltammograms were compared
for bare and MWCNT/PPy-coated carbon paper anodes. A better electrocatalytic
activity was observed in the biocathodic B-MFC as compared to the
bioanodic B-MFC with evident redox peaks, whereas no distinguishable
reduction peak was observed in the bioanodic B-MFC. The results depicted
in the Figure 5a,b
show well-defined redox peaks for the MFC with MWCNT/PPy-coated carbon
paper electrodes as compared to the bare carbon paper electrode utilizing
MFCs. The results confirm the improved electrocatalytic activities
in the case of bioanodic and biocathodic C-MFCs as compare to B-MFCs
with well-defined redox peaks in the former. As can be seen from Figure 5a, a diminished oxidation
peak at 0.089 V is present with no distinguishable reduction peak
in the case of bioanodic B-MFC. However, prominent oxidation peaks
at 0.192 and 0.445 V are observed with two reduction peaks at 0.217
and −0.182 V for bioanodic C-MFC. Likewise in the case of the
biocathodic B-MFC, diminished oxidation and reduction peaks are observed
at 0.122 and 0.197 V while for the C-MFC a more pronounced oxidation
peak at 0.348 V with a prominent reduction peak at −0.209 V
was observed. Similar results have also been observed by Zou et al.
(2008) while utilizing MWCNT/PPy-modified anode for the assimilation
of glucose in the MFC.19 The improved redox
profile in the case of the modified electrodes could be due to the
better electron transfer efficiency between the microbial community
and the electrode, as has been suggested by Khilari et al. (2015).32

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammograms of MFCs with bare and MWCNT/PPy-modified
anode
treating phenol under (a) bioanodic (anaerobic) and (b) biocathodic
(aerobic) conditions.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) serves
as an important
technique to elucidate the electrochemical phenomenon taking place
in the system. The technique has been widely used to derive the internal
resistance of MFC systems which can be broadly divided into 3 main
components viz. ohmic resistance (RΩ), charge transfer resistance (Rct),
and diffusion resistance (Rd).33,34 As shown in Figure 6 the EIS spectra of bioanodic and biocathodic B-MFCs were plotted
and a significant difference was observed possibly owing to the different
environmental conditions present in the system. The equivalent circuit
models have been presented for both the systems and were obtained
by fitting the data with the circuit model. The equivalent circuit
for the bioanodic MFC shows ohmic and charge transfer resistance while
for the biocathodic MFC, the circuit presents the additional element
of warburg impedance representing the diffusion resistance presented
by the biofilm.35 The significant presence
of diffusion resistance in the biocathodic MFC with only glucose in
the anodic chamber could be because of the dense biofilm developed
at the anode offering slight resistance across the biofilm comparative
to the bioanodic MFC. The resistance of the solution is represented
by ohmic resistance while the charge transfer resistance depicts the
activation losses presented by electron transfer from the solution
to the electrode.36 The ohmic and charge
transfer resistances determined for both the systems were found to
be 315 and 58 Ω for the bioanodic B-MFC and 270 and 54 Ω
for the biocathodic B-MFC. Biocathodic B-MFC was observed to have
low ohmic and charge transfer resistances as compared to the bioanodic
B-MFC which also favors the observed better PD results (Figure 6). The results indicate that
although the dense biofilm present in the biocathodic MFC offers additional
resistance, the lower ohmic and charge transfer resistances significantly
improve the performance of the biocathodic system as compared to the
bioanodic system.

3 Conclusions
The MFC has in the past
couple of decades, garnered considerable
attention as an environmental and economically feasible technology
for the elimination of chemical toxicants from various wastewater
discharges. The study presented the comparative analysis of phenol
treatment under anaerobic and aerobic conditions using bare and MWCNT/PPy
nanocomposite-modified carbon paper anode. The results of the study
displayed that the MFCs treating phenol under aerobic conditions (both
B-MFC and C-MFC) performed better as compared to treatment of phenol
under anaerobic conditions. The results also depicted that the increase
in the concentration of phenol beyond 200 mg/L had a derogatory effect
on the performance of MFCs. The results conclude that toxic phenol
can be better treated under aerobic conditions in the MFC and the
treatment efficiency can be greatly improved with the use of MWCNT/PPy-modified
electrodes. However, it is crucial that the influent concentration
is monitored before treatment to obtain superior performance.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Chemicals
Carbon paper electrodes
and Nafion 117 membrane were obtained from Vinpro Technologies (Hyderabad,
India), and the Pyrrole monomer was obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt,
Germany). All the other chemicals were obtained from Thermo Fisher
Scientific India Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai, India) unless stated otherwise
and were used as received.

4.2 Preparation of CNT-PPy Nanocomposite-Coated
Electrode
4.2.1 Functionalization of CNT via Acid Treatment
The functionalization of MWCNT prior to the synthesis of MWCNT/PPy
nanocomposites was done via the oxidative route through acid treatment
in accordance with Okpalugo et al. (2005) and Mehdinia et al. (2014).37,38 For acid treatment, 1 g of MWCNT was refluxed with a mixture of
the HNO3/H2SO4 (3:1) solution at
room temperature for 15 h. Later, the treated concoction was filtered
followed by washing with distilled water until the pH was neutralized.
The washed precipitate was dried at 80 °C for 4 h to remove the
moisture before being further used for nanocomposite synthesis.

4.2.2 Synthesis of MWCNT/PPy Nanocomposites
Functionalized MWCNT (0.2 g) was added to the 0.1 M HCl solution
(150 mL) and sonicated for about 0.5 h at room temperature to disperse
the MWCNTs evenly. A separate 100 mL of the solution of 0.67 g of
PPy in 0.1 M HCl was prepared and added to the above solution of MWCNT
in HCl. The suspension thus obtained was sonicated at the temperature
of 0–5 °C with a dropwise addition of the solution of
0.82 g of ammonium per sulphate in 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl. The suspension
was further sonicated for a period of 4 h at the temperature of 0–5
°C. After 4 h, the MWCNT/PPy composite was filtered and washed
using distilled water. The precipitate was further washed with methanol
until the colorless filtrate was observed. The precipitate thus obtained
was dried under a vacuum for 24 h at room temperature.39Figure 7 presents the pictorial representation of MWCNT/PPy nanocomposite
synthesis.

4.2.3 Electrode Coating
For electrode
preparation, an even layer of 5 mg/cm2 of the MWCNT/PPy
nanocomposite was deposited on the carbon paper surface. It was achieved
by mixing a fixed amount of nanocomposites synthesized with 1 mL of
polyvinylidene difluoride/n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
solution. The thus obtained black paste was hand-coated evenly on
the surface of the electrode, pressed, and dried at 80 °C for
4 h.19

4.3 MFC Setup
Four identical MFC devices
consisting of two cubical chambers each separated by Nafion-117 acting
as proton exchange membranes were constructed. The effective working
volume for each chamber was 200 mL. The carbon papers with a 20 cm2 surface area were used in both the setups as electrodes.
Electrode pretreatment was done in accordance with Scott et al. (2008)40 to improve the performance of the MFC. For pretreatment,
the electrodes were first washed in acetone followed by boiling for
15 min in 1.0 M HCl and finally rinsing with deionized water. Nafion-117
was also pretreated in accordance with our previous work10 in order to achieve higher permeability. A 470
Ω external load41,42 was applied and the electrodes
were connected through a copper wire. To minimize the effect of changing
environmental conditions, all experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled
room with periodic stirring.

4.4 Inoculation and Operation
The study
was performed to examine the effect of two variables on the systems—(i)
effect of environmental conditions (anaerobic and aerobic) provided
for phenolic wastewater treatment and (ii) effect of nanocomposite-coated
electrode on MFC performance. The inoculum was collected from Okhla
Sewage Treatment Plant, New Delhi with a mixed microbial community.
To prepare the system before starting the experiment, the MFCs performing
bioanodic phenol treatment (B-MFC and C-MFC with bare and coated electrode,
respectively) were substrate-acclimated by inoculating the anodic
chamber with the anaerobic sludge and feeding gradually with increasing
concentrations of phenol (10–40 mg/L), and mineral salt media
was added containing glucose (1 g/L) to sustain the growth of microbes.
The cathodic chamber were filled with the phosphate buffer solution
and opened to the ambient air without any external aeration. Conversely,
the MFCs performing biocathodic treatment were inoculated with the
anaerobically acclimated sludge in the anodic chamber with glucose
to support the microbes and act as the electron donor while the aerobically
acclimated inoculum added in the cathodic chamber along with phenol.
The mineral salt media used to support the microbial community was
prepared in accordance with Khan et al. (2017).43 Phosphate buffer solution (NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4; pH 7.2; 0.1 M) was added at the
start of the experiment to maintain the initial pH close to neutral.
After the sludge was successfully acclimatized for a period of 30
days, the solution was replaced with 50 mg/L as the first experimental
phenol concentration and the circuit was closed. The concentration
of phenol was stepwise increased from 50 to 500 mg/L during the study.
A constant glucose concentration of 1 g/L was maintained and replenished
every time the voltage dropped around 100 mV throughout the study.
The systems were operated for a period of 15 days for each concentration
and the samples were collected periodically for different analyses.
The experiments were carried out at the controlled temperature of
30 ± 2 °C in duplicates.

5 Analyses
Samples for different analyses
were collected over regular intervals
of time from all the reactors. An automated digital multimeter was
used to record the voltage generated across the external load (Kehao
KH200, Xiamen Kehao Automation Co., Ltd, Fujian, China). PD was calculated
from the voltage recorded across the applied resistance and reported
in mW/m2. The CE was evaluated to determine the efficiency
of the system in recovering the electrons produced as current. Standard
methods were followed to determine the overall change in COD over
time as the MFCs treat the waste.44 The
overall treatment of phenol in the reactors was confirmed by performing
the UV/visible spectrophotometry in the range of 200–700 nm
while the change in the concentration of phenol was determined by
measuring the change in absorbance at 270 nm (PerkinElmer Lambda 45,
PerkinElmer, California, USA). CV analysis was performed to confirm
the electroactivity in the system using an electrochemical analyzer
(Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, Netherlands). The cycle
was run with the anode as the working electrode, the cathode as the
counter, and the Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode
at a scan rate of 10 mV/s with the potential window in the range of
−1.0 to +1.0 V. EIS was also performed using the electrochemical
analyzer (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, Netherlands)
under the two electrode system with the anode as the working electrode
and cathode acting as counter and reference electrodes. The EIS analysis
was conducted over the frequency range of 10 kHz to 5 mHz under the
OCV conditions with a perturbation of 10 mV aptitude.45 The obtained EIS curve was fitted and simulated to obtain
the equivalent electrical circuit. To confirm the accumulation of
the biofilm on the surface of the electrodes used and the change in
the elemental composition, SEM coupled with EDX was performed (JSM-6510LV,
Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) following the pretreatment in accordance with
our previous work.10
