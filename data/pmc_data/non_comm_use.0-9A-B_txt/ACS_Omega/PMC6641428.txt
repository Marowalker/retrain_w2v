To facilitate the
ongoing transition toward a circular economy,
the availability of renewable materials for additive manufacturing
becomes increasingly important. Here, we report the successful fabrication
of complex shaped prototypes from biobased acrylate photopolymer resins,
employing a commercial stereolithography apparatus (SLA) 3D printer.
Four distinct resins with a biobased content ranging from 34 to 67%
have been developed. All formulations demonstrated adequate viscosity
and were readily polymerizable by the UV-laser-based SLA process.
Increasing the double-bond concentration within the resin results
in stiff and thermally resilient 3D printed products. High-viscosity
resins lead to high-resolution prototypes with a complex microarchitecture
and excellent surface finishing, comparable to commercial nonrenewable
resins. These advances can facilitate the wide application of biobased
resins for construction of new sustainable products via stereolithographic
3D printing methods.

Introduction
Additive manufacturing
or 3D printing offers design freedom, efficient
product development, and on-demand production. Mass fabrication and
global logistics of both raw materials and products are not needed;
3D printing only requires local logistics of raw materials and 3D
printers in close proximity. Biomaterials are produced from renewable
resources, such as organic biomass, instead of fossil fuels, and can
therefore reduce the environmental impact of additive manufacturing.
Hence, the use of renewable materials for 3D printing enables local
manufacturing of new innovative and sustainable products. Ultimately,
this provides the opportunity to realize a biobased and circular economy,
which is restorative and regenerative by design.1

Currently, a variety of 3D printing technologies
are available,
allowing the efficient production of three-dimensional physical objects
from digital models via layer-by-layer addition of materials. Fused
deposition modeling (FDM) is a low-cost rapid prototyping process
based on the extrusion of thermoplastic filaments and the deposition
of molten materials onto a stage. The use of biobased polymers such
as polylactic acid (PLA) in monofilaments has gained a lot of attention
because of their unique properties for 3D printing combined with their
renewability and biocompatibility.2 In
addition, life cycle analysis has demonstrated that the energy demand
of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced up to 64% when applying
low-cost FDM printing with PLA.3

Although FDM is the most widely used rapid prototyping technique,
additive manufacturing started in the 1980s with the development of
the stereolithography apparatus (SLA) by Hull at 3D Systems.4,5 SLA relies on layer-by-layer curing and solidification of liquid
photopolymer resins by a UV laser. When a light projector is applied
instead, exposing the entire layer to UV light simultaneously, the
process is named digital light processing (DLP). Additive manufacturing
via SLA or DLP process is applicable for high-resolution prototyping
and fabrication of (bio)medical devices, for example, dental implants6 and patient-specific scaffolds for tissue regeneration.7 Despite the fast processing, excellent surface
finishing, and extremely high feature resolution (5–50 μm),
postcuring of printed objects is required to guarantee the conversion
of any unreacted groups.8 Moreover, current
commercialized photopolymer resins are expensive and fossil-based,
thus nonrenewable.2,5

SLA/DLP resins require photocurable
moieties, typically multifunctional
epoxy or (meth)acrylate monomers, to ensure cross-linking. Epoxy resins
are cured in a step-growth manner in the presence of amines or anhydrides,
whereas acrylate monomers generally undergo radical chain-growth polymerization.9 Typical acrylate photoresins consist of a combination
of (multi)functional monomers, oligomers, a photoinitiator, and an
optical absorber.10 The absorber function
is to control the penetration depth of the incident light and therefore
the polymerization. The mechanical behavior of thermosetting polymers
is closely related to the underlying molecular architecture, which
is dependent on the monomer composition, photoinitiator concentration,
and curing conditions. High cross-link densities result in increased
stiffness and high thermal stability, whereas toughness decreases.
Indeed, despite their rapid curing and good spatial resolution, acrylate
systems commonly show low toughness and tend to be brittle because
of their high cross-link density and inhomogeneous architecture.5,9

In recent years, a limited number of biodegradable photopolymer
resins have been developed and applied in stereolithography printing.11,12 This concept was initially reported by Matsuda et al., who developed
copolymers of trimethylene carbonate and poly(ε-caprolactone)
that were used to fabricate biodegradable stereolithographic microstructures.13,14 Photo-cross-linkable poly(propylene fumarate) is applied in the
SLA to construct complex 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering
applications.15 Porous network scaffolds
with a gyroid architecture were accurately fabricated by photo-cross-linking
of biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide) macromonomers
functionalized with methacrylate end groups.16

The availability of biobased photocurable resins, produced
from
renewable resources, is even more scarce.17 Microscaffolds were prepared by stereolithography using biobased
unsaturated polyesters,18 using styrene
or hydroxyethyl methacrylate as a cross-linking agent. Very recently,
Miao and co-workers utilized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate as a
biocompatible and renewable liquid resin for SLA, and the solidified
resin possesses striking shape memory effects.19 Nevertheless, both resin systems were not tested on a commercial
3D printing apparatus. To facilitate the ongoing transition from an
economy based on fossil fuels to a biobased economy, the availability
of cost-competitive sustainable materials for rapid prototyping becomes
increasingly important. Hence, this paper will discuss the straightforward
formulation of novel biobased acrylate resins for stereolithography
3D printing and their performance in comparison to commercial counterparts.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Isobornyl acrylate (SA5102, Sartomer), 1,10-decanediol
diacrylate (SA5201, Sartomer), pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (SA5400,
Sartomer), and multifunctional acrylate oligomer (SA7101, Sartomer, Mn = 1.7 kg·mol–1) were
kindly supplied by Sartomer (Arkema Group). Table 1 depicts the characteristics of the bioacrylates,
such as their biobased carbon content (BC), acrylate functionality
(f), molecular weight (M), density
(ρ), concentration of double bonds ([C=C]0), and viscosity (η). The molecular weight of the multifunctional
acrylate oligomer was determined by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) (Figure S1). Diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine
oxide (TPO, Aldrich, 97%) and 2,5-bis(5-tert-butyl-benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene
(BBOT, Aldrich, 99%) were used as received and employed as an initiator
and an optical absorber, respectively. For comparison, commercially
available Autodesk Standard Clear Prototyping resin (ACPR-48, Autodesk)
was acquired.

according to the following equation: [C=C]0 = f·ρ/M.

Resin Preparation
A typical photocurable resin was
prepared as follows. A TPO initiator (0.40 w/w %) and a BBOT absorber
(0.16 w/w %) were added to a cylindrical polypropylene flask in a
darkened fume hood and dissolved in an SA5102 acrylate monomer (19.9
w/w %) by vigorous stirring. Subsequently, the SA5201 acrylate monomer
(39.8 w/w %) and SA7101 acrylate oligomer (39.8 w/w %) were added.
The resulting biobased acrylate photopolymer resin (BAPR-α)
was stirred for 10 min to ensure homogeneity, and the flask was closed
by a screw cap.

Stereolithographic 3D Printing
Prior
to printing, digital
models were downloaded from the web as a standard tessellation language
file from open source sites20,21 and subsequently processed
with PreForm (Formlabs) and Print Studio (Autodesk) software, which
enables the orientation of the objects on the 3D build platform.

An Autodesk Ember (desktop DLP) 3D printer was employed to cure the
commercial (ACPR) resin and build various 3D products. The printer
used an LED projector (λ = 405 nm, 5 W) and had a building volume
of 64 × 40 × 134 mm3. Stereolithographic printing
was performed according to the preprogrammed Standard Clear settings
at room temperature, and a layer thickness of 50 μm was selected.
Tensile bars (ISO 527-2-1BA) were printed normal to the build direction
because of the limited building volume.

A Formlabs Form 2 (desktop
SLA) 3D printer was employed to cure
BAPR and commercial ACPR and build various 3D products. The printer
used a class-1 laser (λ = 405 nm, 250 mW) with a laser spot
size of 140 μm and had a building volume of 145 × 145 ×
175 mm3. Stereolithographic printing was performed according
to the preprogrammed Clear V2 settings in open modus at room temperature,
and a layer thickness of 50 μm was selected. Tensile bars (ISO
527-2-1BA) were printed normal to the build direction (Figure S2). Complex shaped prototypes with a
rook tower design (Figure S3) were produced
for optical analysis.

After the printing procedure, the products
were removed from the
printing head and soaked for 10 min in an alcohol bath containing
isopropanol (IPA, Höfer Chemie, 99.9%) to remove any unreacted
resin. The rinsing procedure of 10 min was repeated in a second IPA
bath. Afterward, the products were exposed to UV irradiation in a
self-fabricated UV oven (λ = 365 nm, 36 W) for 60 min at room
temperature to ensure complete curing.

Characterization
GPC was performed in dimethylformamide
(1 mL min–1) with 0.01 N LiBr on a Viscotek GPCmax
equipped with model 302 TDA detectors, using two columns (Agilent,
PolarGel L + M, particle size 8 μm, 7.5 × 300 mm2). Molecular weights were calculated relative to poly(methyl methacrylate)
according to universal calibration using narrow disperse standards
(Polymer Laboratories).

A Paar Physica MCR300 rheometer with
a parallel-plate geometry was used to measure the resin viscosity.
The diameter of the geometry was 50 mm, and the gap between two geometries
was 1 mm. All measurements were performed at room temperature.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed in
the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode using a Bruker A225/QHP
Platinum-ATR accessory with a diamond top plate on a Bruker VERTEX
70 spectrometer equipped with a DLaTGS detector at a resolution of
2 cm–1.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was
performed on a PerkinElmer
thermogravimetric analyzer TGA 7. A temperature range of 25–700
°C was applied at a heating scan rate of 10 °C/min under
a nitrogen atmosphere.

An Instron 4301 1kN series IX was used
to determine the mechanical
properties, such as tensile strength and Young’s modulus. Measurements
were performed in quintuplicate at room temperature and according
to the ISO 527 method at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min.

Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a Philips
XL30 ESEM-FEG operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Prior to
imaging, the specimens were coated with 30 nm Pt/Pd (80:20).

Results
and Discussion
Resin Formulations
Homogeneous acrylate
photoresins
with varying BC were successfully prepared. The open-source ACPR-48
from Autodesk’s Ember 3D printing project was acquired as a
reference.22 Mimicking the composition
of ACPR-48, BAPR-α consists of 20 w/w % monofunctional reactive
diluent (i.e., isobornyl acrylate), 40 w/w % difunctional monomer
(i.e., 1,10-decanediol diacrylate), 40 w/w % multifunctional acrylate
oligomer, 0.40 w/w % initiator, and 0.16 w/w % optical absorber. This
formulation leads to an average biobased content of 67%, calculated
from the individual BC of the components (Table 1). The compositions of BAPR-β, BAPR-γ,
and BAPR-δ are depicted in Table 2. With low-cost biobased acrylates as the main component,
the BAPR resins are extremely cost-competitive with respect to commercial
products.

b Viscosity
at a shear rate of 100
s–1.

For
the application in a stereolithographic layer-by-layer printing
process, the resin viscosity is a crucial parameter. In general, low
viscosities are desired to allow appropriate recoating of the liquid
resin between the last layer of the model and the resin tank surface.23 The viscosity of the uncured bioacrylate resins
was determined as a function of shear rate (Figure 1), and Newtonian behavior was observed in
all samples. Table 2 displays the viscosities at a high shear rate of 100 s–1, which is commonly achieved during the recoating step of the process.24 BAPR-α and BAPR-β have a lower viscosity
in comparison to ACPR-48. BAPR-γ and especially BAPR-δ
demonstrate higher viscosities because of the incorporation of more
viscous pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (Table 1). Nevertheless, both values are on the same
order of those of other commercial photocurable resins of Formlabs;
Formlabs’ clear and flexible resins have viscosities of 1.6
and 7.3 Pa·s, respectively (Figure S4). All formulations developed in this study demonstrate adequate
viscosity for the application in the stereolithographic printing equipment.

and commercial ACPR-48.

Stereolithographic 3D Printing of Bioacrylate Resins
Both
SLA and DLP processes were applied, employing Formlabs Form
2 and Autodesk Ember 3D printers, respectively, to build 3D constructs.
In general, laser-based SLA is more precise and suitable for the fabrication
of high-resolution structures, whereas DLP is faster. To explore and
compare both techniques, the mechanical properties of cured ACPR-48
were addressed. Consequently, tensile bars were printed on both 3D
printers and subsequently analyzed with stress–strain measurements.
No significant difference was observed between SLA and DLP in terms
of tensile strength (σm) (Figure 2). In addition, similar values for the elastic
modulus (E) were determined for both techniques.
Because the mechanical performance of the commercial resin is rather
independent on the printing method, all bioacrylate resins were cured
on the Form 2 SLA printer because of the limited building volume of
the Ember DLP printer.

Figure 2 Tensile strength (red) and Young’s modulus (cyan)
of cured
ACPR-48 printed on both Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D printer and Autodesk
Ember DLP 3D printer. The tensile bars (ISO 527-2-1BA) were printed
normal to the build direction.

The successful polymerization of BAPR-α is confirmed
by postprinting
FTIR analysis (Figure 3). The signals corresponding to C=C bonds in the acrylate
moiety (1627, 1407, and 806 cm–1) significantly
decreased after printing, indicating the consumption of double bonds
due to the network formation. For the same reason, the signal representing
to C–O–C oscillation of the ester group shifted from
1188 to 1156 cm–1.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of (a) uncured BAPR-α
(orange) and (b) cured
BAPR-α (blue) printed on the Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D printer.

All BAPRs (α–δ)
were successfully applied in
the stereolithographic 3D printing process for the construction of
tensile bars and complex shaped prototypes, enabling a thorough mechanical
and optical characterization, respectively. Despite successful printing,
BAPR-α causes the swelling of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
layer inside the SLA vat, thereby destructing the resin tray within
a few days. By removing isobornyl acrylate as a monofunctional component
from the bioacrylate resin formulation, the swelling of PDMS was prevented.
As a result, BAPR-β, BAPR-γ, and BAPR-δ remained
stable in their SLA trays for months.

Mechanical Performance
The nature of a polymeric network,
that is, the molecular architecture, strongly influences the mechanical
behavior of the bulk material.9,25 The cross-link density
particularly dictates the strength and modulus of a thermoset. In
general, a higher concentration of double bonds ([C=C]0) in the system results in the formation of a highly cross-linked
polymer network,26,27 and higher cross-link densities
lead to an increased stiffness of the material. Indeed, the Young’s
modulus (E) of the cured BAPR products increases
with increasing double-bond concentration (Table 2). The same trend is observed with thermal
analysis. TGA curves in Figure 4 indicate an increased thermal stability with increasing [C=C]0. The lower cross-link densities in cured BAPR-α and
BAPR-β systems lead to polymer degradation at lower temperatures
in comparison to BAPR-γ and BAPR-δ.

Figure 4 TGA curves of the cured
BAPR samples and commercial ACPR-48 printed
on the Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D printer.

The mechanical performance of
the cured BAPR-δ was the highest
with respect to all biobased resins, demonstrating an ultimate tensile
strength of 7.0 MPa (Table 2). Nevertheless, the tensile strength of the cured ACPR-48
is 2.7 times higher. The thermal stability of the commercial product,
however, is lower with respect to those of both BAPR-γ and BAPR-δ
(Figure 4).

Morphology
The construction of complex shaped prototypes
was performed for optical analysis. Prototypes with a rook tower design
were successfully printed for all biobased acrylate resins, which
are demonstrated by the photographs in Figure 5. The SEM images of the internal helix part,
having a diameter of ca. 700 μm, reveal a high feature resolution
and excellent surface finishing and confirm the potential of our bioacrylate
resins to fabricate 3D structures with complex microarchitectures.
The electron micrographs at a high magnification demonstrate serration
at the vertical edges of the internal helix in all samples, which
is typical for the SLA/DLP process. This is caused by the top surface
of exposed (50 μm) layers receiving a larger dose of UV radiation
than the back surface.10

rook tower prototype printed with BAPR-α
(left) and corresponding SEM images of the internal helix in the prototype
(right), (b) photograph of the rook tower prototype printed with BAPR-β

(right), (c) photograph of the rook tower prototype printed with BAPR-γ
(left) and corresponding SEM images of the internal helix in the prototype
(right), (d) photograph of the rook tower prototype printed with BAPR-δ
(left) and corresponding SEM images of the internal helix in the prototype
(right), and (e) photograph of the rook tower prototype printed with
ACPR-48 (left) and corresponding SEM images of the internal helix
in the prototype (right). All products were printed on the Formlabs
Form 2 SLA 3D printer.

Extensive cracks are observed both macroscopically and microscopically
in the prototypes built from BAPR-α and BAPR-β (Figure 5a,b). Cracking in
UV-cured systems can result from shrinkage forces developed during
and after curing.9 For (meth)acrylated
systems, shrinkage is found to be inversely related to the initial
viscosity.28,29 As a result, this behavior is
significantly reduced when curing more viscous BAPR-γ. The SEM
images only reveal minor cracks at the surface (Figure 5c), indicating less shrinkage. Finally, the
prototypes fabricated with highly viscous BAPR-δ demonstrate
a very smooth surface (Figure 5d), equivalent to that fabricated with the commercial standard
(Figure 5e).

Conclusions
Renewable photopolymer resins based on biobased acrylates are prepared
for the application in stereolithographic 3D printing. Their resin
viscosities of 0.14–4.6 Pa·s are within the range of current
commercial counterparts, and the use of low-cost bioacrylates makes
the resins potentially cost-competitive. Straightforward application
of the bioresin formulations in a commercial SLA printer is demonstrated
by the successful fabrication of tensile bars and prototypes with
a complex rook tower design. The elastic modulus and thermostability
of the cured products increased with increasing double-bond concentration,
corresponding to a higher degree of cross-linking. Cracking as a result
of shrinkage stress is strongly reduced for more viscous resins, leading
to complex shaped prototypes with high feature resolution and excellent
surface finishing. This progress enables on-demand fabrication of
a wide range of sustainable and renewable products and facilitates
the biobased economy.
