Diblock copolymers of poly(tert-butyl methacrylate)
(PtBuMA) and poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)
(PDMAEMA) of four different block lengths were prepared by sequential
two-step reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer radical
polymerization, followed by hydrolysis of the PtBuMA
blocks to obtain poly(methacrylic acid)-b-PDMAEMA
(PMAA-b-PDMAEMA). The effect of the PDMAEMA block
length on the multistimuli-responsive amphiphilic features of both
types of diblock copolymers was investigated as CO2-switchable
emulsifiers for emulsification/demulsification of n-octane (an oil) in water in response to CO2/N2 bubbling. The amphiphilicity of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA was switched on, and the amphiphilicity of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA was switched off by CO2 bubbling at pH 12 and
25 °C to achieve emulsification/demulsification. A longer PDMAEMA
block length in PMAA-b-PDMAEMA conferred more sensitive
CO2-responsive amphiphilicity but reduced the extent of
recovery of emulsification ability on N2 bubbling. This
newly developed diblock copolymer system could potentially serve as
a “multifunctional surfactant” for CO2-switchable
emulsification/demulsification of oil-in-water and water-in-oil mixtures.

Introduction
The effects of pH,
light, and temperature on the self-assembly
of polymers in aqueous solutions have been extensively studied,1−3 and gas stimuli have received increased attention in recent years.4−6 The functions of polymers can be affected by adding gases into the
polymer matrices, and most gases can be easily added and removed during
the gas-bubbling process; thus, gas-responsive polymers have attracted
a great deal of attention in both industry and research. Carbon dioxide
(CO2) is a nonflammable, nontoxic, and easily removable
gas that is inexpensive due to its abundance. CO2 has been
reported to function as an environmentally friendly stimulus, for
instance, for transformation of neutral and hydrophobic amidine groups
or tertiary amine groups in water into charged and hydrophilic amidinium
bicarbonate4,7 or ammonium bicarbonate.6,8 Thus,
long chain alkyl amidines or tertiary amines can be transformed to
amphiphilic molecules by CO2 bubbling and employed as emulsifiers
in emulsion polymerization.9,10 Such emulsification
ability can be subsequently switched off by simply removing the CO2 by purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, or
air.4 Thus, using these CO2-triggered
switchable emulsifiers, the resulting latexes can be easily destabilized
by removing the CO2 by bubbling an inert gas and/or increasing
the temperature to switch the active amidinium or ammonium bicarbonate
emulsifier to a surface-inactive neutral compound, without the need
for traditional approaches such as adding salts, strong acids, or
alkalis. Furthermore, the aggregation and redispersion of the resulting
latex particles can be reversibly controlled by alternating bubbling
of N2 and CO2.9,11−13

Diblock copolymers that possess stimuli-responsive amphiphilicity
have been also reported.6,14,15 For instance, poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate)-b-poly(N-isopropyl
acrylamide) (PDMAEMA-b-PNIPAAm) exhibits temperature-
and pH-triggered amphiphilicity under specific temperature and solution
pH conditions. The temperature- and pH-responsive amphiphilic properties
of these block copolymers in aqueous solution can lead to a variety
of self-assembly processes; self-assembly was demonstrated to change
from spherical micelles to vesicular structures with increasing PNIPAAm
block length at fixed PDMAEMA block length.16 Poly(N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PDEAEMA-b-PNIPAAm) exhibits “schizophrenic” self-assembly
in aqueous solution, depending on the polymer block length, solution
pH, and temperature.17 The schizophrenic
self-assembly of diblock copolymers from vesicles to micelles in solution
can be also controlled by bubbling CO2 at temperatures
above or below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the
PNIPAAm block.18 Therefore, these polymers
have potential for a wide range of applications in various fields
of engineering and medicine.15,19,20

Recently, we demonstrated that the amphiphilicity of PDMAEMA-b-PNIPAAm diblock copolymers with different PNIPAAm block
lengths can be switched on/off by CO2/N2 bubbling
at certain combinations of temperature and solution pH to enable the
block copolymers to function as an emulsifier for oil-in-water emulsifications.21 More importantly, phase transition studies and
emulsion experiments clearly demonstrated that these copolymers possess
dual CO2 and temperature responsiveness, which enabled
efficient control of reversible emulsification processes under specific
conditions. A longer PNIPAAm block length, which confers higher hydrophobicity
to the PNIPAAm block at elevated temperatures (for instance, 40 °C),
had a greater impact on the amphiphilicity of the block copolymers
and their ability to function as an effective emulsifier. Our study21 was the first example of CO2/N2-switchable diblock copolymer emulsifiers with reversibly
controllable amphiphilic characteristics for achieving oil-in-water
emulsification.

In addition to CO2-switchable amidine
and tertiary amine
functional groups (described above) that switch from neutral to cationic,
the COOH group of carboxylic acids can also function as the CO2-switchable functional group that switches from anionic to
neutral.22 At high solution pH, CO2 converts the carboxylates (anionic organic bases) of carboxylic
acids from a more hydrophilic form (COO–) to the
less hydrophilic COOH group. The direction of the CO2 switch
for the neutral forms of bases (e.g., amines and amidines) is the
opposite of that for the negatively charged forms of bases (e.g.,
carboxylates). Poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) in aqueous solution at
high pH is an example of an anionic organic base. At high solution
pH, the relatively low hydrophilic COOH groups of PMAA dissociate
into relatively high hydrophilic carboxylate anions (COO–) of PMAA. These carboxylate anions can reversibly associate with
protons to form relatively low hydrophilic COOH groups on bubbling
CO2. Thus, at high pH, the relatively high water solubility
of PMAA can be converted into a relatively low water solubility of
PMAA by lowering the pH by bubbling CO2. Therefore, the
direction of the CO2-induced switch in water solubility
is opposite for PMAA and PDMAEMA; PDMAEMA converts from low to high
water solubility on CO2 bubbling.

In this study,
PMAA (containing COOH groups) was block-copolymerized
with PDMAEMA (containing tertiary amine groups) via hydrolysis of
the poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) (PtBuMA) block in PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA,
which was prepared by sequential two-step reversible addition–fragmentation
chain transfer radical polymerization (Scheme 1). The opposite directions of the CO2-induced switches in the hydrophilicity of PMAA and PDMAEMA
enabled the preparation of versatile, multifunctional block copolymer
emulsifiers. The potential of these multistimuli-responsive diblock
copolymers with different PDMAEMA block lengths as versatile CO2-switchable emulsifiers were investigated for the emulsification
of n-octane (an oil) in water in response to CO2/N2 bubbling. This report reveals that the amphiphilicity
of these diblock copolymers can be switched on/off by CO2 bubbling at certain combinations of temperature and solution pH
to achieve oil-in-water emulsification. This novel diblock copolymer
system provides a potential route toward the fabrication of multifunctional
polymeric emulsifiers for emulsion applications.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA
via RAFT
The chemical structures of all polymers were resolved
by 1H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of PtBuMA-CTA, PDMAEMA-CTA, and the four PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers prepared by RAFT.
In spectra (B) to (E) in Figure 1, the peak at 1.44 ppm was assigned to the CH3 of the tert-butyl groups in PtBuMA, and the peak at 2.35 ppm was assigned to the CH3 of the tertiary amine in PDMAEMA. The intensity of the 1.44 ppm
peak decreased from spectra (B) to (E), whereas the intensity of the
2.35 ppm peak increased from (B) to (E), indicating that four block
copolymers of different molecular weights were prepared and the molar
ratio of the DMAEMA/tBuMA units increased from (B) to (E). This indicates
that the degree of polymerization of PDMAEMA increased from (B) to
(E) since the degree of polymerization of PtBuMA
in the four block copolymers was fixed. By calculating the areas of
the characteristic peaks at 0.87 ppm for CTA, the CH3 peak
at 1.44 ppm for PtBuMA, and the CH3 peak
at 2.35 ppm for PDMAEMA, the molecular weight of the PtBuMA block was determined from the 1H NMR spectra of PtBuMA-CTA to be 7100 g/mol, corresponding to a degree of
polymerization of 50. The molecular weights of the four PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers were 8300, 11,000,
18,600, and 48,900 g/mol, as determined from the corresponding 1H NMR spectra. The molecular weights of the PDMAEMA block
were calculated to be 1200, 3900, 11,500, and 41,800 g/mol. The copolymer
compositions and degrees of polymerization of the block copolymers
obtained were PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA7,
PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA24, PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA72, and PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA266.

Figure S1 shows the
FTIR spectra of
PtBuMA-CTA, PDMAEMA-CTA, and the four PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers prepared by RAFT.
In spectra (A) and (B) in Figure S1, the
peaks at 1367 and 1393 cm–1 corresponded to CH3 bending in the C–(CH3)3 group
of PtBuMA, whereas the peaks at 2770 and 2820 cm–1 were assigned to CH3 stretching in the
N–CH3 group of PDMAEMA. The variations in intensity
of these peaks in Figure S1C–F suggested
that four block copolymers of different molecular weights were successfully
prepared, consistent with the 1H NMR results. GPC was performed
to identify molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of
the polymers. Figure 2 shows the GPC curves for PtBuMA and the four PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers in DMF
containing 20 mM LiBr as the mobile phase. The Mn, Mw, and dispersity (ĐM) values calculated from the GPC curves
are presented in Table S1. The GPC data
revealed that the ĐM values of the
five samples prepared by RAFT were in the range of 1.24–1.53
(Table S1); this molecular weight distribution
is relatively narrow compared to polymers prepared by conventional
free radical polymerization. In this study, PtBuMA-CTA
was first prepared by RAFT, followed by subsequent RAFT of PDMAEMA
using PtBuMA as a macro chain transfer agent. In
the GPC curves in Figure 2, PtBuMA-CTA had the longest retention time,
and retention time decreased as the molecular weight of PDMAEMA in
the copolymer increased, further indicating that four copolymers with
different molecular weights were successfully prepared. The molecular
weight rank of the four copolymers based on the GPC data and 1H NMR data was similar. However, GPC overestimated the molecular
weights compared to 1H NMR. This could be attributed to
the different features of the two analytical techniques. Thus, DSC
analyses were performed over the temperature range from −20
to 160 °C to verify the structures. Figure 3 shows the second DSC heating curves of pure
PtBuMA, pure PDMAEMA, and the four PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers. The Tg values obtained from Figure 3 are listed in Table S2. The Tg values of pure PtBuMA and pure PDMAEMA were determined to be 125.0 and 15.3
°C from curves a and f in Figure 3, respectively. This indicates that PtBuMA is a rigid polymer, whereas PDMAEMA is a soft polymer. Each
of the four block copolymers appeared to have a single Tg located between the Tg values
of PtBuMA and PDMAEMA, and Tg decreased as the molecular weight of PDMAEMA in the copolymer
increased. The single Tg suggests that
PtBuMA is compatible with the PDMAEMA in the block
copolymer.

and (f) pure PDMAEMA.

Hydrolysis of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA
To Obtain PMAA-b-PDMAEMA Diblock Copolymer
Next, the PtBuMA block in the copolymers was further
hydrolyzed with aqueous hydrochloric acid to yield PMAA-b-PDMAEMA diblock copolymer. The structures of the products obtained
after hydrolysis were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy and DSC. Figure 4 shows the FTIR spectra
of pure PMAA, pure PDMAEMA, and the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
block copolymers obtained from hydrolysis of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA. A very broad peak at 3400–2400 cm–1, which overlapped the C–H stretching absorptions
in Figure 4A, was attributed
to the characteristic COOH stretching vibrations in PMAA. The peaks
at 2775 and 2818 cm–1 are the characteristic CH3 stretching in the N–CH3 group of PDMAEMA
(Figure 4B). The characteristic
CH3 stretching peaks of pure PDMAEMA were shifted to lower
frequencies in the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers
and increased in the intensity as the molecular weight of the PDMAEMA
blocks increased (Figure 4C–F), perhaps due to formation of complexes of COOH
groups and tertiary amines. Figure 4 shows that PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA of four different molecular weights was successfully hydrolyzed
to obtain PMAA-b-PDMAEMA of four different molecular
weights. The 1H NMR spectra of a PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymer before and after hydrolysis in Figure S2 indicated that the heat treatment under
acidic conditions did not noticeably affect structural characteristics
of the PDMAEMA block. In other words, the PDMAEMA block survived the
harsh acid treatment during hydrolysis of PtBuMA.
To further verify the FTIR results, DSC was performed to examine the
phase behavior and Tg of the block copolymers
in the presence of the PMAA blocks. Figure 5 shows the second DSC heating curves of pure
PMAA, pure PDMAEMA, and the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block
copolymers. The Tg values obtained from Figure 5 are listed in Table S3. The Tg values
of pure PMAA and PDMAEMA were 177.4 and 15.3 °C from curves a
and f in Figure 5,
respectively, indicating that PMAA is a very rigid polymer due to
strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between COOH groups, whereas
PDMAEMA is a soft polymer. Each of the four block copolymers appeared
to have single Tg, between the Tg values of PMAA and PDMAEMA, and Tg decreased as the molecular weight of PDMAEMA (which
has a low Tg value) increased. The single Tg suggests that PMAA is compatible with PDMAEMA
in the block copolymer. The significantly higher Tg of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA compared to that
of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA proved that
PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA was hydrolyzed
to PMAA-b-PDMAEMA, in confirmation of the previously
discussed FTIR evidence.

PDMAEMA.

The surface tension values of
aqueous solutions of the four PMAA-b-PDMAEMA copolymers
were measured by the pendant drop
method to investigate the surface activity of the copolymers as emulsifiers
for emulsification of an oil-in-water mixture. As shown in Figure 6A, at 25 °C
and pH 2, the surface tension of aqueous solutions of the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers with four different molecular
weights slightly decreased with the copolymer concentration. However,
at 25 °C and pH 12, the surface tension of the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA aqueous solutions (Figure 6 B)significantly decreased with the copolymer concentration
up to 0.05 wt %, and then the surface tension leveled off above this
concentration, indicating that the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
block copolymer exhibited higher surface activity in pH 12 solutions
than in pH 2 aqueous solutions. The longer PDMAEMA block length appeared
to lead to higher surface activity of the block copolymer aqueous
solutions of pH 12. Collectively, at 25 °C and pH 2, PMAA and
PDMAEMA are both water soluble, although PMAA has a relatively low
solubility compared to PDMAEMA. The block copolymers exhibited obscured
amphiphilicity under these conditions; thus, surface tension only
slightly reduced as the concentration of block copolymer increased.
At 25 °C and pH 12, PMAA is hydrophilic due to strong interactions
between carboxylate groups and water, whereas PDMAEMA has a low hydrophilicity
due to deprotonation of the tertiary amine groups. Thus, the block
copolymers exhibited clear amphiphilicity under these conditions,
and surface tension significantly decreased as the block copolymer
concentration increased.

as a function of concentration at 25 °C. The aqueous solutions
were adjusted to pH 2 in (A) and pH 12 in (B).

pH Responsiveness of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA

Prior
to hydrolysis of PtBuMA to PMAA, PtBuMA is hydrophobic and insoluble in water. PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA is only water soluble at very low
pH, for example, pH 2, as the pH-responsive PDMAEMA is highly water
soluble at pH 2. After hydrolysis, PMAA exhibits pH-responsive solubility
in water, with low water solubility at low pH and high water solubility
at high pH. This encouraged us to investigate the pH responsiveness
of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA in water, as PMAA and PDMAEMA exhibit
opposite responses to changes in pH. The two-way pH responsiveness
of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA in water is associated with the
switch from protonation to deprotonation in response to a change from
low to high pH for both PMAA and PDMAEMA. However, the switch from
protonation to deprotonation leads to opposite changes in water solubility
of each polymer. The water solubility of PMAA increases and that of
PDMAEMA decreases in response to a change from low to high pH.

The two-way pH responsiveness of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
in between pH 2 and 12 is demonstrated in Figure 7 in which PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
aqueous solutions appeared to be cloudy (an indication of formation
of cation/anion complexes) in an intermediate pH range. The positive
charges (cations) of PDMAEMA came from protonation of tertiary amine
groups, and the negative charges (anions) of PMAA were from dissociation
of COOH groups. The positive charges increased with decreasing pH
values, whereas the negative charges increased with increasing pH
values. The pKa values are around 7.5
to 7.8 for PDMAEMA23,24 and near 5.5 for PMAA.25 As solution pH increases above the pKa value of a polymer, deprotonation prevails
over protonation for the polymer. As solution pH decreases below the
pKa value of a polymer, protonation prevails over
deprotonation for the polymer. For the same PDMAEMA and PMAA block
lengths, therefore, the cloudy solution (complex formation) would
occur at a pH near the middle value (around 6.5) between the two corresponding
pKa values. The pH at which cloudy solution
appeared would be higher than this middle value (around 6.5) as the
PDMAEMA block length was longer than the PMAA block and would be lower
than 6.5 as the PDMAEMA block length was shorter than the PMAA block
as can be seen in Figure 7.

at 25 °C. Each photo was taken 4 h after sonication.

CO2-Switchable PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA and PMAA-b-PDMAEMA Emulsifiers
To investigate the potential of the PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA and PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers
as CO2-switchable emulsifiers, 0.5 wt % copolymer in 5
mL of deionized water at pH 2 or 12 and 25 °C was mixed with
1 mL of n-octane to form separated, two-phase solutions
with the aqueous layer on the bottom and the oil (n-octane) on the top. The two-phase pH 2 and 12 mixtures were ultrasonically
vibrated to investigate the ability of the block copolymers to emulsify n-octane in water to form a single-phase solution. The phase
change was recorded 4 h after ultrasonic vibration to ensure phase
stability. The added copolymer could serve as an emulsifier if the
two-phase mixture became a homogeneous, single-phase solution. If
the mixture remained as two separate phases, the copolymer could not
serve as an emulsifier.

As shown in Figure 8, single-phase solutions formed in all four
mixtures with PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA at
pH 2, indicating that the four block copolymers all served as an emulsifier
at pH 2 and 25 °C. In contrast, the pH 12 mixtures remained as
two-phase solutions, indicating that the four block copolymers cannot
serve as an emulsifier at pH 12 and 25 °C. At pH 2, PDMAEMA is
protonated and becomes water soluble, while PtBuMA
remains hydrophobic, so the block copolymers are amphiphilic and could
serve as an emulsifier. At pH 12, PDMAEMA is deprotonated and has
low hydrophilicity, while PtBuMA remains hydrophobic,
so the copolymers exhibited obscured amphiphilic characteristics and
could not serve as an efficient emulsifier to emulsify the oil in
water.

Figure 8 Phase changes for mixtures of 1 mL of n-octane
and 5 mL of deionized water at pH 2 or 12 and 25 °C containing
2.5 wt % PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA relative
to n-octane. The pH 2 and 12 mixtures were ultrasonically
vibrated for 1 min, and each corresponding phase change was recorded
4 h after ultrasonic vibration. The photos in the last two columns
were taken 4 h after CO2 or N2 bubbling. After
CO2 bubbling and subsequent N2 bubbling, the
pH values of the pH 12 solution decreased to 5.4 and increased to
8.5, respectively.

Upon bubbling CO2 for 5 min into the pH 12 mixture at
25 °C, the separated two-phase mixture reverted to a single phase,
indicating that CO2 bubbling reduced the pH and allowed
the block copolymer to serve as an emulsifier again. The mixture containing
PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA266 did not appear
to return to a homogeneous single phase; it is possible that 5 min
of CO2 bubbling at 20 mL/min was not sufficient to confer
water solubility to the high molecular weight of PDMAEMA (because
of chain entanglements) in this copolymer. The emulsification ability
of the copolymers was reduced after subsequent N2 bubbling
for 30 min to remove CO2, as indicated by phase separation
of the mixtures (Figure 8). The removal of CO2 increased the pH, leading to deprotonation
and reduction in the water solubility of PDMAEMA and the amphiphilicity
of the block copolymers.

As can be seen in Figure 9, at pH 2 and 25 °C, the
mixture containing PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266 appeared to
be a single-phase solution, whereas
the mixtures containing the other three block copolymers appeared
to have small portions of clear phases at the bottom, indicating that
PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266—with the highest molecular
weight of the PDMAEMA block—could serve as a highly efficient
emulsifier, whereas the other three block copolymers with shorter
PDMAEMA block lengths could only serve as a fairly good emulsifier.
On the contrary, at pH 12 and 25 °C, the three block copolymers
with relatively low molecular weights of PDMAEMA served as better
emulsifiers than PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266, which could
only serve as a fair emulsifier—perhaps due to the high molecular
weight and thus high chain entanglement of PDMAEMA, which may hinder
formation of micelles. These findings revealed that the amphiphilicity
of the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymer is strongly
pH- and molecular weight-dependent. The PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
block copolymers could serve as an effective emulsifier at both pH
2 and 12 if the PDMAEMA block length was appropriate. In theory, at
low pH (pH 2), PMAA was considered to have relatively low water solubility
and PDMAEMA had relatively high water solubility. In contrast, at
high pH (pH 12), PMAA was considered to have relatively high water
solubility and PDMAEMA had relatively low water solubility. Additionally,
water solubility could be affected by the molecular weights of the
constituent blocks. Therefore, the emulsification ability of the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers was determined by pH and the
molecular weights of the constituent blocks.

Figure 9 Phase changes in mixtures
of 1 mL of n-octane
and 5 mL of deionized water at pH 2 or 12 and 25 °C containing
2.5 wt % PMAA-b-PDMAEMA relative to n-octane. The pH 2 and 12 mixtures were ultrasonically vibrated for
1 min, and the phase changes were recorded 4 h after ultrasonic vibration.
The photos in the last two columns were taken 4 h after CO2 or N2 bubbling.

Upon bubbling CO2 into the pH 12 mixture for 3 min, the pH reduced
to around pH 6 at which interpolyelectrolyte complexation was found
for PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24 (Figure 7). The emulsification abilities of PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72
and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266 were clearly reduced due
to a reduced amphiphilicity at pH 6 (Figure 9), whereas PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7
and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24 were remained as a fairly
good emulsifier at pH 6 (Figure 9) likely due to the Pickering effect of the interpolyelectrolyte
complex. Upon subsequent N2 bubbling for 30 min, the pH
was back up to near pH 8 at which interpolyelectrolyte complexation
was found for PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72 and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266 (Figure 7). The emulsification abilities of PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72 and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266 were slightly
recovered at pH 8 likely due to the Pickering effect of the interpolyelectrolyte
complex, whereas those of PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24 increased at pH 8 (Figure 9) likely due to a stable Pickering effect
of the interpolyelectrolyte complex formed from pH 6 and/or an increase
in amphiphilicity. In PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7 and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24, the short PDMAEMA block lengths could have
a great extent of recovery of hydrophobicity and lead to an increase
in amphiphilicity of the two block copolymers by bubbling N2 because of a fast removal of CO2, as compared to PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72 and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266. This
observation confirmed that the process of CO2/N2 gas bubbling can be applied to achieve manipulation and dispersion
of the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers at the water/oil
interface.

Conclusions
PtBuMA
was block-copolymerized with PDMAEMA via
two steps of RAFT polymerization to form PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers, followed by hydrolysis of the
PtBuMA blocks to obtain PMAA-b-PDMAEMA.
PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA exhibited clear
amphiphilic features and could serve as an efficient emulsifier at
pH 2 and 25 °C. At pH 12 and 25 °C, PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA exhibited an obscured amphiphilic feature but
could be switched to an efficient emulsifier by CO2 bubbling
and lost its emulsification ability on N2 bubbling. PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers could serve as effective emulsifiers
at both pH 2 and 12 if the PDMAEMA block length was appropriate. The
amphiphilicity of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA at pH 12 and 25
°C could be reduced by CO2 bubbling to reduce its
emulsification ability, and its emulsification ability could be recovered
on N2 bubbling; the duration of bubbling required strongly
depended on the PDMAEMA block length. A longer PDMAEMA block length
in PMAA-b-PDMAEMA conferred more sensitive CO2-responsive amphiphilicity but a lower recovery of emulsification
ability on N2 bubbling. This study offers significant potential
for the fabrication of two-way, dual-responsive diblock copolymers
with controllable structures that offer two-way changes in amphiphilicity,
excellent CO2 and pH responsiveness, and reversible emulsification
properties in both organic and aqueous media.

Experimental Section
Materials
Tert-butyl methacrylate
(tBuMA, 97%, Tokyo Chemical Industry) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl
methacrylate (DMAEMA, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were purified by distillation
at reduced pressure. Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN, Aldrich) was
recrystallized from methanol. 2-Cyano-2-propyl-dodecyl trithiocarbonate
(CPDT, >97%, Strem Chemicals) was used as received. 1,4-Dioxane
(J.T.Baker)
was distilled prior to use. All other solvents were obtained at the
highest purity available and used as received.

Two-Step Reversible Addition–Fragmentation
Chain Transfer
(RAFT) Radical Polymerization of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA Diblock Copolymer
We present the two-step synthetic
approach for the preparation of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA diblock copolymer in Scheme 1. A solution of tBuMA monomer (17.5
g, 0.123 mol), CPDT (0.21 g, 6.15 × 10–4 mol)
as a chain transfer agent, and AIBN (0.01 g, 6.15 × 10–5 mol) as an initiator in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL; molar concentration
ratio, 2000:10:1) in a reaction vessel was degassed through three
freeze/pump/thaw cycles and placed in a thermostat oil bath (70 °C)
to initiate the reaction with stirring under N2 for 48
h. The reaction product was precipitated in MeOH/water (4:1, 400 mL),
filtered, and vacuum dried at 60 °C for 2 days to obtain the tBuMA homopolymer (PtBuMA) (yield: 41.9
wt %).

DMAEMA comonomer of four different weights (for preparing
four different PDMAEMA block lengths), PtBuMA (as
a RAFT macro chain transfer agent), and AIBN were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane
(20 mL) in the reaction vessel. The molar ratios of DMAEMA/PtBuMA/AIBN were 8000:10:1, 4000:10:1, 2000:10:1, and 1000:10:1.
The DMAEMA molar concentration was 1 M. The mixture was degassed through
three freeze/pump/thaw cycles and placed in a thermostat oil bath
(70 °C) to initiate block copolymerization with stirring under
N2 for 24 h. The reaction product was precipitated in n-hexane (400 mL) to remove unreacted DMAEMA by decanting
the upper portion of the solution. The polymer solution in the lower
portion was dissolved in MeOH (50 mL) and added to n-hexane (400 mL), and the upper portion of the solution was decanted
again. After repeating the same purification step for the third time,
the precipitate was dried under vacuum for 2 days to obtain PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers with PDMAEMA
blocks of four different molecular weights. 1H NMR analysis
of the copolymer compositions revealed the degrees of polymerization
for the obtained block copolymers were PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA266, PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA72, PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA24,
and PtBuMA50-b-PDMAEMA7.

Hydrolysis
of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA
To Obtain PMAA-b-PDMAEMA Diblock Copolymer
Subsequently, the tert-butyl groups of the PtBuMA blocks in the copolymers were hydrolyzed with dilute
hydrochloric acid to yield PMAA-b-PDMAEMA diblock
copolymers, as shown in Scheme 1. Hydrolysis of the PtBuMA blocks of the
copolymer (1 g) was conducted in the presence of aqueous hydrochloric
acid (2 mL, 12 M) in 1,4-dioxane (15 mL) under reflux for 8 h, and
then the reaction mixture was precipitated in ether (200 mL). After
decanting the upper portion of the solution, the polymer solution
in the lower portion was precipitated twice with ether (200 mL), and
then the precipitate was dried under vacuum for 2 days to give PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA266, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA72, PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA24, and PMAA50-b-PDMAEMA7. The
block copolymers were subsequently dissolved in DI water (30 mL) and
purified by dialysis (molecular weight cutoff: 6000–8000 g/mol)
against water for 3 days to completely remove low-molecular-weight
molecules. High-purity PMAA-b-PDMAEMA was obtained
after vacuum drying at 60 °C for 2 days.

Characterizations
An 1H NMR (JNM-ECZ600R)
spectrometer (600 MHz, JEOL, Japan) was used to quantitatively characterize
the copolymer compositions and molecular weights of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA in CDCl3 solvent and PMAA-b-PDMAEMA in D2O solvent. Fourier transform infrared
spectrometry (FTIR, Spectrum Two, PerkinElmer, USA) was used to qualitatively
characterize the PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA
block copolymers after casting THF solutions onto KBr and the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA block copolymers after casting DMF solutions onto
CaF2. The spectra were generated at room temperature at
a resolution of 2 cm–1 and a sensitivity of 16 scans.

The molecular weights and dispersity (ĐM) of the synthesized PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA copolymers were determined using a gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) system equipped with a series of two columns (PLgel 10 μm
Mixed-B, Polymer Laboratories, UK) and a refractive index detector.
DMF containing 20 mM LiBr was the eluent at a flow rate of 0.6 mL
min–1 at 35 °C.

The glass transition
temperatures (Tg) of the copolymers were
determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC, Q100, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA); the cycle conditions
were heating (20 °C/min) to 180 °C, cooling (10 °C/min)
to −50 °C, and then heating at 20 °C /min to 180
°C to record Tg.

Measurements
on pendant drops of pH 2 and 12 aqueous solutions
of PMAA-b-PDMAEMA were conducted to determine the
surface tension of the solutions as a function of copolymer concentration
at 25 °C using a contact angle analyzer (Model 100SL, Sindatek
Instruments Co., Taiwan). The pH responsiveness of 0.5 wt % PMAA-b-PDMAEMA in water was investigated by adjusting the pH
of the solutions using HCl or NaOH to pH 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12. A
digital camera was used to record phase changes. The photos were taken
4 h after each pH change.

CO2-Switchable PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA and PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
Emulsifiers
To investigate the potential of PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA and the PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
block copolymers
as CO2-switchable emulsifiers, 0.5 wt % of each copolymer
in 5 mL of DI water was adjusted to pH 2 or 12 and then mixed with
1 mL of n-octane (oil phase). The emulsification
abilities of the copolymers were examined after ultrasonic vibration
of the two-phase mixtures using a sonicator (Sonifier 150D, Branson,
Danbury, CT) at 6.5 W for 1 min at 25 °C and recorded using a
digital camera. The pH 12 solutions were subsequently bubbled with
CO2 for 5 min (for PtBuMA-b-PDMAEMA as an emulsifier) or 3 min (for PMAA-b-PDMAEMA
as an emulsifier) to investigate the CO2 switchability
of emulsification/demulsification, followed by N2 bubbling
for 30 min to investigate the recovery of demulsification/emulsification.
Photographs were taken 4 h after each CO2 or N2 bubbling. The bubbling flow rates were controlled at 20 mL/min.
