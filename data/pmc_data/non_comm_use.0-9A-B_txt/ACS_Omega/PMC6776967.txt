Two
blue fluorescent dendrimers named PVAC2 and PVACA have been
newly synthesized and investigated, where the carbazole/diphenylamine
hybrid dendron is adopted instead of oligocarbazole. Compared with
the reference dendrimer PVCt3, the emission maxima of PVAC2 and PVACA
are found to be red-shifted accompanied by a slight reduction of the
photoluminescence quantum yield in films. Most importantly, the highest
occupied molecular orbital level is elevated from −5.35 eV
of PVCt3 to −5.20 eV of PVAC2 and −4.95 eV of PVACA.
Because of the favored hole injection, the turn-on voltage is accordingly
decreased from 3.6 to 3.2 and 2.6 V. The value of PVACA is even lower
than the theoretical limit of 2.78 V. In addition, PVAC2 exhibited
the best nondoped device performance, showing a nearly doubled power
efficiency of 4.80 lm/W relative to PVCt3 (2.37 lm/W). The results
clearly indicate that dendron engineering is also a promising strategy
to develop solution-processible blue fluorescent dendrimers capable
of being used for power-efficient organic light-emitting diodes.

1 Introduction
Wet method is believed
to be a more favorable technique than vacuum
deposition for the preparation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)
so as to realize low-cost and large-area solid-state lighting sources
and flat-panel displays.1−4 In this case, the used electroluminescent materials
include small molecules,5−7 polymers,8,9 and
dendrimers.9−15 Among them, dendrimers possess excellent solution processibility
due to their inherent branched topology structures. Meanwhile, the
emissive core (either fluorescence,12,13 phosphorescence14,15 or TADF16,17) is often surrounded by the periphery dendrons
to prevent the unwanted self-aggregation and concentration-quenching
in neat films. These features make dendrimers suitable for efficient
solution-processed nondoped OLEDs.

Nowadays, a series of dendrimers
have been successfully demonstrated,
whose emission colors can range from blue to red.18−27 However, we observe that the turn-on voltage, especially for blue-emitting
ones, is still far away from the driving voltage theoretical limit
(Eg/e: corresponds to
the optical bandgap divided by the electron charge).28 To solve such a problem, we have, for the first time, proposed
dendron engineering in self-host blue phosphorescent dendrimers to
develop power-efficient nondoped OLEDs that can be drived at low voltage
which is adjacent the theoretical limit. Instead of oligocarbazole,
the carbazole/diphenylamine hybrid is used to enhance the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dendron.29 Owing to the favored hole injection and exciton
formation, the operating voltage at 1, 100, and 1000 cd/m2 is greatly decreased from 4.9/5.8/7.4 V of B-CzCz with oligocarbazole
dendrons to 2.7/3.4/4.4 V of B-CzTA with carbazole/diphenylamine hybrid
dendrons, respectively. Also the corresponding maximum power efficiency
is nearly doubled from 15.6 to 30.3 lm/W.

Promoted by this interesting
result, herein, we further extend
the dendron engineering strategy from phosphorescent to fluorescent
dendrimers. Starting from PVCt330 that
introduce oligocarbazole into the periphery of 4,4′-distyryl-1,1′-biphenylene
(Figure 1), two dendrimers
named PVAC2 and PVACA have been synthesized and investigated by gradually
replacing carbazole with diphenylamine in the dendritic wedge. Attributed
to the stronger electron-donating ability of diphenylamine than carbazole,
the HOMO level is found to be increased following a sequence of PVCt3
(−5.35 eV) < PVAC2 (−5.20 eV) < PVACA (−4.95
eV). Compared with PVCt3, an improved nondoped device performance
including brightness, luminous efficiency, and power efficiency is
realized for PVAC2 and PVACA. Noticeably, PVACA achieves a turn-on
voltage of 2.6 V which is even lower than the theoretical limit (2.78
V).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Thermal Properties
The synthetic route for the fluorescent dendrimers PVAC2 and PVACA
is presented in Scheme 1. First, a CuI-catalyzed Ullmann reaction between 4-(bis(4-iodophenyl)amino)benzaldehyde
and the second-generation carbazole (D2) or carbazole/diphenylamine
hybrid dendron (DA) was performed to afford the key intermediates
MD1 and MD2. Then they were treated with 4,4-bis(di-ethylphosphonomethyl)biphenyl
via a Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction to give the desired
dendrimers PVAC2 and PVACA in a yield of 65–71%. Their chemical
structures are characterized by 1H NMR, matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry
(MS) and elemental analysis. They all show excellent solubility in
common solvents, such as toluene, chlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) etc., assuring to form a good film via spin-coating.

Also, the thermal stabilities of PVAC2 and PVACA
compared with
PVCt3 were investigated by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). They are thermally stable, showing Td (5% weight loss) of 537, 519 and 542 °C
for PVCt3, PVAC2, and PVACA, respectively (Figure 2). Moreover, the Tg is found to be down from 372 °C of PVCt3 to 342 °C of
PVAC2 and 293 °C of PVACA. This can be ascribed to the weaker
rigidity of diphenylamine relative to carbazole.

for PVCt3, PVAC2, and PVACA.

2.2 Photophysical Properties
The UV and
photoluminescence (PL) spectra in toluene for PVCt3, PVAC2, and PVACA
are shown in Figure 3a. It can be clearly seen that with the increasing number of diphenylamine,
the 298 nm characteristic absorption from carbazole in PVCt3 and PVAC2
disappears, and a new absorption band centered at about 310 nm is
observed in PVACA. Meanwhile, the low-energy band that is related
to π–π* transitions of the core shows an obvious
bathochromic shift from PVCt3 to PVAC2 and PVACA. Also the corresponding
optical band gap is reduced from 3.02 to 2.79 and 2.78 eV (Table 1). Accordingly, the
maximum emission has a red shift from 418 nm of PVCt3 to 446 nm of
PVAC2 and 451 nm of PVACA. The solution PL quantum yield (PLQY) is
determined to be 0.94, 0.85, and 0.54 for PVCt3, PVAC2, and PVACA
using 9,10-diphenylanthracene as the standard, respectively. Unlike
the rigid carbazole, the flexible diphenylamine moiety is easier to
bring about nonradiative decay and thus lowered the PLQY. Ongoing
from solution to films, the PL spectra become structureless accompanied
by a red-shift of 20 nm (Figure 3b). The observation indicates the existence of aggregation
in solid states to some degree, which is further proved by the decreased
film PLQYs (0.39–0.59).

and PVACA: (a) UV–vis

f HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 V), LUMO = HOMO + Eg, where Eox is

2.3 Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
performance of the dendrimers was performed in dichloromethane using
cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV data are shown in Figure 4, during the anodic scan, they
all exhibit multiple oxidation processes, whereas during the cathodic
scan no reduction waves are detected. Because diphenylamine has a
stronger electron-donating capability than carbazole, the first oxidation
wave is reasonably downshifted toward a negative potential. Using
ferrocene/ferrocenium as an internal standard (−4.8 eV), the
HOMO level is accordingly enhanced from −5.35 eV of PVCt3 to
−5.20 eV of PVAC2 and −4.95 eV of PVACA. The observed
variation implies the favored hole injection and transporting, which
is beneficial for the realization of low-voltage-driving solution-processed
OLEDs. In addition, together with the absorption optical band gap,
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is estimated
to be −2.33, −2.43, and −2.17 eV for PVCt3, PVAC2,
and PVACA, respectively.

2.4 Electroluminescence Properties
To
explore the electroluminescence (EL) performances of the dendrimers,
we fabricated the nondoped OLEDs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/dendrimer/TPBI/LiF/Al
(Figure 5a). Here the
dendrimers of PVCt3, PVAC2, or PVACA without the usage of any additional
host were independently used as the emitting layer, and 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene
(TPBI) as the hole-blocking and electron-transporting layer. Similar
to the PL counterpart, the EL spectra exhibited a distinct red-shift
from PVCt3 to PVAC2 and PVACA (Figure 5b), finding CIE values of (0.16, 0.10), (0.16, 0.23)
and (0.18, 0.25), respectively.

PVACA: (a) energy level

and power efficiency as a function of current density.

Figure 5c,d
presents
the performances of the nondoped OLEDs, and the key data are summarized
in Table 2. As shown,
both the J–V and L–V curves move to a negative voltage
from PVCt3 to PVAC2 and PVACA. Consequently, the turn-on voltage is
significantly decreased from 3.6 to 3.2 and 2.6 V. The observation
is in well agreement with their HOMO levels. On one hand, the growing
HOMO can lower the hole injection barrier. On the other hand, due
to the enhanced HOMO difference between PVACA and TPBI (Figure 5a), the injected holes may
tend to accumulate on PVACA. Albeit its varied LUMO, electrons could
still be injected from TPBI to PVACA easily via a Coulomb force, leading
to the decreased driving voltage. It should be noted that the PVACA-based
device displays a turn-on voltage that is even smaller than the theoretical
limit (2.78 V). According to the literature,31 this may be ascribed to the thermally assisted EL process. Compared
with PVCt3 (4729 cd/m2, 2.89 cd/A, 2.37 lm/W), PVAC2 and
PVACA reveal a much better device performance. For example, a peak
brightness of 9667 and 6596 cd/m2, a maximum luminous efficiency
of 5.20 and 3.88 cd/A, and a peak power efficiency of 4.80 and 4.00
lm/W are attained for PVAC2 and PVACA, respectively. The observed
inferior performance of PVACA to PVAC2 may originate from the reduced
film PLQY (0.39 for PVACA and 0.45 for PVAC2).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, two blue fluorescent dendrimers named PVAC2 and
PVACA have been newly synthesized and investigated, where the carbazole/diphenylamine
hybrid dendron is adopted instead of oligocarbazole. Compared with
the reference dendrimer PVCt3, the HOMO levels of PVAC2 and PVACA
are enhanced to favor the hole injection. As a result, lower driving
voltages and thus higher power efficiencies are successfully achieved
for the nondoped devices based on PVAC2 and PVACA. We believe that
this strategy will accelerate the development of solution-processible
blue fluorescent dendrimers capable of being used for power-efficient
OLEDs.

4 Experiment
4.1 General
Information
The chemical
structures were characterized by 1H NMR (Bruker AVANCE
400 NMR), MALDI-TOF MS (AXIMA CFR MS apparatus) and elemental analysis
(C, N, H on a Bio-Rad elemental analysis system). TGA and DSC were
tested under N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 with TGA 7 and Elmer-DSC 7 systems which are
obtained from PerkinElmer. The UV–vis absorption and PL spectra
were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer and
LS 50B spectrofluorometer. The thin solid films for measurement were
obtained on quartz by spin-coating. The solution PLQYs were measured
with a standard blue fluorophor 9,10-diphenylanthracene (ΦPL = 0.90), and the solid film PLQYs were recorded by using
an integrating sphere on a HAMAMATSU (C9920-02). CV experiments were
operated on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660a) with a glass carbon
working electrode and a Pt counter electrode under a scan rate of
100 mV s–1 against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode
with a solution of 0.1 M n-Bu4NClO4 in dry dichloromethane as the electrolyte.

4.2 Device Fabrication and Measurement
ITO-coated patterned
glass substrates were precleaned carefully and
used ultraviolet ozone to treat the substrates of 30 min. Then, a
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P AI4083) film of 40 nm thickness was prepared
on the top of ITO and baked for 45 min at 120 °C. Then the solutions
of the dendrimers in chlorobenzene were spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS as
the emissive layer (45 nm). After annealed at 100 °C (30 min)
under N2, the films were transferred into a evaporator,
then at a pressure of less than 4.0 × 10–4 Pa
a film of TPBI (55 nm) was deposited on the emissive layer. Finally,
LiF (0.5 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited as the cathode. A PR650
spectra colorimeter was used to record the EL spectra and CIE values.
The J–V–L properties were obtained from a calibrated silicon photodiode and
a Keithley 2400/2000 source meter. The external quantum efficiencies
(EQEs) were calculated based on the current J–L properties and the EL spectra assuming a Lambertian emission.

4.3 Synthetic
All commercially available
reagents and chemicals were used without further purification. Solvents
for chemical synthesis were purified as the standard procedures. D2,25 DA32 and 4-(bis(4-iodophenyl)amino)benzaldehyde33 were synthesized according to the reference
method.

and (+/−)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (0.6 mL, 4.8 mmol) were
added under argon, then the reaction solution was heated to reflux
at 110 °C for 24 h under vigorous stirring. After the reaction
system cooled, H2O and CH2Cl2 were
extracted to get the crude product. The organic was purified by column
chromatography using a CH2Cl2/n-hexane (1:3) eluent to afford a white solid MD1 (13.0 g, 60%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.99 (s, 1H), 8.25

get the crude product. The product was purified by column chromatography
