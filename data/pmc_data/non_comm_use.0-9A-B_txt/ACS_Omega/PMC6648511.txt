Synthetic diamond films are routinely
grown using chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) techniques. Due to their extraordinary combination
of intrinsic properties, they are used as the functional layers in
various bio-optoelectronic devices. It is a challenge to grow the
dimensional layers or porous structures that are required. This study
reviews the fabrication of various porous diamond-based structures
using linear antenna microwave plasma (LAMWP) chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), a low-cost technology for growing diamond films over a large
area (>1 m2) at low pressure (<100 Pa) and at low
temperature
(even at 350 °C). From a technological point of view, two different
approaches, i.e., templated diamond growth using three different prestructured
(macro-, micro-, and nanosized) porous substrates and direct bottom-up
growth of ultra-nanoporous diamond (block-stone and dendritelike)
films, are successfully employed to form diamond-based structures
with controlled porosity and an enhanced surface area. As a bottom-up
strategy, the LAMWP CVD system allows diamond growth at as high as
80% CO2 in the CH4/CO2/H2 gas mixture. In summary, the low-pressure and cold plasma conditions
in the LAMWP system facilitate the growth on three-dimensionally prestructured
substrates of various materials that naturally form porous self-standing
diamond structures.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Because of their superior
properties, synthetic monocrystalline
diamonds and polycrystalline diamond thin films have for decades been
the focus of interest of various research teams.1−3 At the same
time, diamond is used in numerous industrial fields. As a consequence,
various diamond structuring strategies have been developed to fit
specific requirements,4−6 e.g., large surface areas, geometrically ordered
microstripes or meshes,7 nano-objects or
nanostructures (wires, rods, and whiskers),8,9 porous
films and membranes,10,11 etc.

Recently, nanoscaled
fibrous materials have been attracting attention
due to their specific characteristics, such as high bending performance,
flexibility in surface functionalities, a high surface-area-to-volume
ratio, and controllable pore size.12 These
advantages make them interesting candidates for a wide variety of
applications, e.g., filtration, separation, catalysis, storage and
transportation, adsorption, tissue engineering, drug delivery systems,
sensors, etc.8,9,13−15 For example, tailorable pore size is a key requirement
in filtration and/or separation.16,17

However,
fabricating these nanostructures from diamond remains
a technological challenge, due to the great hardness of diamond and
its chemical inertness or due to undesired diamond graphitization.
Ongoing studies have therefore focused on fabricating nanostructures,
explaining specific growth phenomena, and developing appropriate technological
procedures.

There are two main approaches to diamond film structuring:
(i)
postgrowth processing (top-down) and (ii) pregrowth (bottom-up) processing.
These two approaches differ in the number of technological steps and
also in the dimensionality and the geometrical aspect ratios that
can be achieved in the structures that are fabricated. Top-down processing
involves technological steps, such as depositing a masking material
(Al, Ni, Au, Cu, and Pt) followed by plasma etching (generally oxygen
with Ar, CF4, or CHF3)5,14 or
by thermocatalytically induced etching (graphitization or burning).11,18 The first study on top-down fabrication of porouslike diamond films
was reported by Kriele et al.16 They fabricated
freestanding diamond films consisting of nanopores localized between
diamond grains. The porouslike structure was achieved by etching nondiamond
carbon forms (mainly localized along grain boundaries) by annealing
in air at elevated temperatures (530–560 °C).

Bottom-up
processing is either guided by selective area nucleation/deposition
or is achieved by direct growth on prestructured substrates, porous
membranes, or nanofibers.4,6,15 Key benefits are minimal technological steps and a larger variety
of complex geometries. However, the main limitation is the less precise
fabrication of structures, due to (i) the pyramidlike diamond growth
of the crystals and (ii) the hard-to-control vertical and lateral
diamond growth. Using the bottom-up approach, porosity of the diamond
films is achieved by either (i) employing geometrically prestructured
substrates (i.e., templated growth) or (ii) optimized chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) by providing suitable growth conditions (mainly by
varying the gas mixture). The variety of supporting substrates includes
fully or partially transformable polymers,19−21 various non-carbon-based
templates,14,17,22,23 carbon-based templates,24−28 or SiOx-based templates.29−31 The important advantage of templated diamond growth is that the
porosity is generally guided by the template that is used.27,30,32 In the course of the development
and usage of these supports, various aspects of procedures that can
be used and specific applications have already been discussed. For
example, diamond nanoparticles in a polymer matrix can be used for
fabricating porous diamond structures,7,19 for enhancing
the seeding efficiency in planar diamond deposition and for diamond
growth on vertical structures.20,33,34 In the case of diamond deposition on graphitelike materials, the
proper seeding technology and the chemical stability of these materials
has a direct effect on the final geometry of the structure that is
formed.26,27 In addition, the pore size of the templates
has a strong influence on the penetration of the growth species in
depth (i.e., in the Z-direction) during chemical
vapor deposition (CVD). Pore size therefore has an impact on the final
thickness of a porous diamond-based structure.10,30,35

This can be overcome by using layer-by-layer
deposition,29,31,32 but it is a time-consuming and
expensive procedure. For direct growth of thick porous diamond layers,
steady kinetic reactions during CVD are required to achieve porous
growth rather than micro- or nanocrystalline growth.36,37 A reliable technique for templated and direct fabrication of porous
diamond structures is highly sought after.

In this paper, we
introduce the linear antenna microwave plasma
(LAMWP) CVD system as a promising “4L” (low-pressure,
low-temperature, low-cost, and large-area) technology for fabricating
a great variety of porous diamond-based structures. We present and
summarize five complementary bottom-up technological processes suitable
for fabricating diamond-based structures with different porosities.
Two approaches are involved: (1) templated diamond growth on porous
substrates, including (i) carbon foam (C-foam) with macrosized porosity,
(ii) a nonwoven nanofibrous SiOx mat with microsized porosity,
(iii) buckypaper (BP) composed of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT)
with nanosized porosity, and (2) direct plasmochemically driven growth
of (i) block-stone-like and (ii) dendritelike diamond films with ultra-nanosized
porosity. All of these approaches allow the fabrication of self-standing
three-dimensional (3D) diamond-based porous structures with the use
of just one CVD system.

2 Experimental Part
2.1 Materials and Preparation
The LAMWP
CVD system consists of a water-cooled chamber with two linear Cu conductors
(≈60 cm in length) located inside quartz tubes. A distributed
gas inlet enables a homogeneous precursor input over the complete
length of the antennas. Microwave power is delivered from both sides
by two microwave generators (2.45 GHz, Muegge) working at pulse-frequency
up to 500 Hz and at maximum power up to 4.4 kW in a pulse, using a
specially designed splitter-adapter (Muegge GmbH). The plasma is generated
in an asymmetric way between the two electrodes and ground.38 This configuration provides homogeneous plasma
distribution at low working pressure (units of Pa) over the water-cooled
graphite substrate holder 30 × 20 cm2 in area.39 The design principle and corresponding reaction
mechanism (simplified for H2 plasma) of such a deposition
system can be found in ref (40). The distance between the substrate holder and the antennas
(Z-axis distance) can be adjusted in the range of
several centimeters and was fixed at 7 cm in this work. At this distance,
the effective electron temperature Teff is about 1.5 eV,41 i.e., the LAMWP system
is characterized by a cold MW plasma process at the surface of the
substrate. This setup allows diamond growth at low temperature (250
°C).42 However, if needed, the substrate
temperature can be controlled independently of the CVD process by
a resistively heated substrate holder up to 800 °C.43 In this study, we performed diamond deposition
at temperatures in the range between 350 and 650 °C in a CH4/CO2/H2 gas mixture. The porous diamond
structures were fabricated either by novel CVD growth on a planar
substrate or by low-pressure CVD growth on macro-, micro-, and nanoporous
templates.

A commercially available rigid and highly porous
(80 pores per in.) C-foam was used as a macrosized porous template.44 The C-foam (15 × 10 × 3 mm3) was first oxidized by RF oxygen plasma to make its surface hydrophilic.
On the basis of the previously optimized nucleation and growth procedures,27 the C-foam was seeded for 10 min in a poly(vinyl
alcohol)/nanodiamond (50:50 ratio) mixture, using an ultrasonic bath.

The microsized porous template was a silica (SiOx) nonwoven
three-dimensional nanofibrous mat produced by needleless electrospinning
(NanoSpider, Elmarco Ltd.). The mat consisted of randomly oriented
submicron fibers (ø ≈ 100 nm) weighing 20 g m–2, and the total thickness of the mat was about 60–70 μm.
The large SiOx mat was cut into smaller pieces (3 ×
4 cm2) and was treated in RF oxygen plasma to achieve a
hydrophilic character. The prepared mats were then seeded by soaking
in a dispersion of deionized water and ultradispersed detonation diamond
(UDD, ø ≈ 5–10 nm, New Metals and Chemicals Corp.
Ltd.).

Finally, a buckypaper (BP) composed of single-wall carbon
nanotubes
(SWCNTs) was used as the nanosized porous template. The fabrication
procedure is described in ref (45). In brief, the SWCNTs were first dispersed in an n-methyl pyrrolidone solution and were then filtered through
the nylon membrane by vacuum filtration to fabricate a self-standing
dense SWCNT BP. The BP substrate was approximately 8 μm in thickness.
Before the diamond CVD, the BPs were immersed in deionized water with
UDD for 30 min.

The ultra-nanoporous (block-stone and dendritelike)
diamond films
were fabricated on mirror-polished Si(100) substrates 1 × 1 cm2 in size, which were ultrasonically seeded in a suspension
of deionized water and UDD. Similarly, silicon substrates coated with
ultranano- (UNCD) and microcrystalline diamond (MCD) layers were also
used, but no ultrasonic treatment was performed on them.

The
substrates with various porosities and diamond CVD growth conditions
are presented in Table 1.

2.2 Materials Characterization
The surface
morphology and the grain size of the fabricated diamond films/structures
were analyzed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope
(SEM) operating in secondary electron mode (MAIA3, Tescan Ltd.) and
in semi-in-lens mode (JSM7500F, JEOL). The diamond character of the
deposited films was determined by Raman spectroscopy (InVia, Renishaw)
using a He–Cd laser with 325 and/or 442 nm excitation wavelengths.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Templated
Diamond Growth
3.1.1 Macrosized Porosity:
Diamond Growth on C-Foam
The structure with macrosized porosity
was produced by templated
growth of a diamond film on C-foam. In general, it is not a simple
task to grow diamonds on this kind of graphite-based material using
high-density MW plasma CVD, due to the presence of atomic hydrogen
and oxygen species in the plasma, which degrades and etches this material.
One solution is to use a poly(vinyl alcohol) and UDD mixture for the
nucleation of C-foams, followed by diamond growth.27 It should be noted that successful overgrowth of porous
C-foams by a continuous diamond film within the whole volume of the
substrate (3D growth) was achieved only by the LAMWP CVD. Representative
SEM images of the bare and diamond-coated C-foams are shown in Figure 1a,b. The presence
of the diamond film is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 1c). The Raman spectrum of the
bare C-foam consists of two bands known as the D band (defect sp2 phases), centered at 1356 cm–1, and the
G band (graphitic phases) centered at 1585 cm–1.
Compared with the bare C-foam, the Raman spectra of the diamond-coated
C-foam taken from the top and the bottom side reveal a red-shift of
the position of the D band from 1356 to 1332 cm–1. Additionally, the band at 1150 cm–1, which is
attributed to trans-polyacetylene (t-PA) chains at diamond grain boundaries, is also present. The diamond
morphology taken at three different depths through the C-foam is shown
in Figure 1d. The diamond
coating is present throughout the bulk of the macroporous C-foam framework.
However, due to the variations in the penetration efficiency of the
active species within the Z-scale (∼3 mm),
a visible difference in the thickness of the diamond film is observed,
i.e., delayed closing/growing of the diamond film was achieved at
the bottom of the substrate. However, this delay can easily be solved
by a prolonged deposition time. Similar results (not shown here) were
also observed for C-foams with lower porosity (60 pores per in.) and
with higher porosity (100 pores per in.).

bare and (b) diamond-coated C-foams. (c)
Raman spectra of the bare and diamond-coated C-foams (top and bottom
side) measured with the 442 nm excitation wavelength. (d) SEM images
of the diamond-coated C-foam taken from the top to the bottom of the
substrate (i.e., Z-depth profiling).

We will now discuss the homogeneity of the deposited
diamond film
within the C-foam volume (bulk) achieved in our LAMWP system. Marton
et al.25 also exposed C-foam to the diamond
growth process in a hot filament (HF) CVD system. They observed the
formation of various carbon-based materials (diamond, carbon nanowalls,
graphite nanosheets, etc.) within the volume of the C-foam, depending
on the Z-distance from the hot filaments. Marton
et al. also reported a strong influence of the porosity of the foam
on the deposited structures. The diamond growth rate decreased rapidly
or there was even no diamond growing inside the C-foam volume with
increased porosity. This was attributed to a lack of atomic hydrogen
penetrated into the C-foam. Thanks to the significantly lower working
pressure in the LAMWP CVD system than that in the HF CVD system (i.e.,
10 vs 3000 Pa), deeper penetration of the growth species into the
C-foam volume should be achieved and any formation of nondiamond forms
is effectively suppressed. Other types of materials with similar porosity
(e.g., silicon carbide or alumina foam, etc.) can be used to minimize
any complications related to carbon-based substrates (damage to the
substrate and substrate etching).

3.1.2 Microsized
Porosity: Diamond Growth on a
SiOx Mat
Self-standing porous diamond membranes
were fabricated using templated growth on three-dimensional microporous
SiOx fiber mats. The template (mat thickness, average fiber
diameter, pore size, and the relative spacing between the fibers)
was primarily defined by the parameters of the electrospinning process. Figure 2a shows a top-view
SEM image of the electrospun fiber mat, which comprises randomly oriented
SiOx fibers with submicron diameter and a smooth surface. Figure 2b shows top and cross-sectional
views of the nanofiber mat after the diamond CVD process. Detailed
views (see Figure 2d) confirm a hermetic coating of SiOx fibers with the
diamond film.

mat. (b)
Top-view, cross-sectional view, and (d) detailed-view SEM images of
the SiOx fiber mat after diamond deposition. (c) Raman
spectra of the top and the bottom of the diamond-coated SiOx mat measured with the 442 nm excitation wavelength.

Some authors have reported that diamond deposition
on a fibrous
template dominates only on the top surfaces whereas other layers shield
the inner part from plasma, resulting in nonuniform diamond growth
within the Z-depth.10,31 The reason
for this was assigned to hindered diffusion and penetration of reactive
species into the bulk of the densely packed fibrous template.30,32 To improve the homogeneity of the diamond film growth with the template
bulk, polymers have been used as the seeding layer30 or a layer-by-layer deposition process has been used.31 As has already been demonstrated above, the
LAMWP system naturally forces diamond growth also on 3D substrates
(i.e., on perpendicular walls of prestructured substrates). Its low-pressure
operation mode (10 Pa) prolongs the mean free path of active species
and therefore naturally suppresses any limitations in diffusion.10,30,32

It should be noted that
oxygen plasma pretreatment and subsequent
seeding with diamond nanoparticles also ensured homogeneous nucleation
throughout the volume of the template by the opposite surface charges
of UDD46 and SiOx fibers. No
mixing with polymer matrix30,31 was therefore necessary
in our case. The fibers were well-overgrown by the diamond film throughout
the 65 μm thickness of the substrate; see Figure 2b. Moreover, the diamond film well copied
the initial microstructure of each individual fiber. We were also
able to coat the whole membrane efficiently, using two-sided deposition
in a single run. In this case, the fiber mats were mounted on a special
substrate holder (i.e., the templates “hovered” ∼1
cm above the substrate holder), which enabled simultaneous chemical
vapor deposition on both sides, i.e., on the top side and on the bottom
side. No major morphological changes were observed for the top and
bottom parts of the diamond-coated SiOx mat, which indicates
almost identical films.

These results are also supported by
Raman measurements, i.e., the
Raman spectra from the top and from the rear side are similar (see Figure 2c). In general, both
Raman spectra are dominated by the diamond characteristic peak centered
at 1332 cm–1 and by two broad bands at 1385 and
1600 cm–1, which are attributed to the D band and
the G band, representing the nondiamond carbon bonds (sp2 phases) in the diamond film.47 The weak
band centered at 1168 cm–1 corresponds to trans-polyacetylene groups localized mainly at grain boundaries.
The LAMWP system also ensured excellent deposition homogeneity over
large areas; i.e., 18 samples 3 × 4 cm2 in size were
coated within a single deposition run.

3.1.3 Nanosized
Porosity: Diamond Growth on SWCNT
Buckypaper
Finally, we report on templated diamond growth
on very densely packed SWCNT buckypaper with nanosized porosity. Figure 3a shows the top-view
SEM image of the bare buckypaper substrate, which is primarily composed
of SWCNT bundles, with only a small amount of impurities (amorphous
and carbonaceous residues). The corresponding Raman spectrum (Figure 3c) reveals four characteristic
peaks/bands: (i) radial breathing mode at 193 cm–1, (ii) the D band at 1360 cm–1, (iii) the split
G band (G– and G+ at 1566 and 1593 cm–1, respectively), and (iv) two-dimensional (2D) mode
at 2705 cm–1. After the diamond CVD process, the
SWCNT bundles were homogeneously coated with a nanocrystalline diamond
(NCD) film (Figure 3b) not only on the top of the substrate but also throughout the volume
of the porous BP (see the cross-sectional SEM image in Figure 3b). This compact diamond coverage
led to significant changes in the Raman spectrum (Figure 3d), which is now dominated
by two bands recognized as the D band (a broad band combining the
diamond peak 1333 cm–1 and the red-shifted defect
band 1348 cm–1) and the blue-shifted G band to 1607
cm–1.

Figure 3 (a) Top-view SEM image of the bare SWCNT BP.
(b) Top-view and cross-sectional-view
SEM images of the diamond-coated SWCNT BP. The corresponding Raman
spectra of the (c) bare and (d) diamond-coated SWCNT BP samples, measured
with the 442 nm excitation wavelength.

In the case of diamond growth on SWCNT BP, both the low working
pressure and the gas composition are crucial parameters. The gas composition
has to be chosen very properly to avoid the formation of a two-layer
compartment heterostructure, due to the rapid diamond growth rate
and, at the same time, to avoid the rapid substrate etching by atomic
hydrogen. Moreover, the typically used CH4/CO2/H2 gas mixture in the LAMWP system results in more complex
plasmochemical reactions than in the conventionally used CH4/H2 atmosphere. The main role of the added CO2 gas is to increase the diamond growth rate and to improve the diamond
quality.48 However, the presence of oxygen
species together with atomic hydrogen species makes the plasma environment
more aggressive, especially for the nondiamond carbon-based substrates.49 However, unconventional diamond growth can be
achieved at an unusually high ratio of CO2 to H2 (see Section 3.2).

As a summary of Section 3.1, the pulsed microwave cold plasma system with a
linear antenna
arrangement is versatile for the production of various porous diamond
structures with adjustable morphologies. The low-pressure operation
lengthens the homogeneity of the diamond growth in the substrate Z-depth and also enhances the penetration of the growth
species into the porous templates. However, the pore size is still
a substantial parameter because penetration of the growth species
is clearly easier (simpler) for large (macro-) pores than for smaller
(micro- and nano-) pores. Thanks to the large distance of the microwave
plasma from the substrate, the LAMWP system also enables two-sided
deposition in a single run and homogeneous diamond growth in the volume
of thick or densely packed porous templates. Moreover, the LAMWP system
can vary the deposition conditions (temperature and gas composition)
in a wide range to tailor the thickness, the morphology, and the crystalline
quality of the diamond coating to specific needs. It should be noted
that boron-doped diamond films can also be prepared by this system,
which widens the applicability of porous diamond structures.

3.2 Ultra-Nanosized Porosity: Plasmochemically
Driven Porous Diamond Growth
Porous (block-stone and dendritelike)
diamond films were also directly grown on standard seeded polished
silicon substrates or on polycrystalline diamond films deposited on
silicon in the pulsed microwave cold plasma system with a linear antenna
arrangement. Using the same deposition conditions (see Table 1) as those for the overgrowth
of the SWNCT BP templates, we observed homogeneous coverage of Si
with well-faceted block-stone diamond crystals (Figure 4a). Some crystals exhibit platelike structures,
i.e., quasi 2D diamond crystallites around 20 nm in thickness (yellow
arrow) and up to 200 nm in lateral dimension (white arrow). The length-to-thickness
aspect ratio was approximately 10. Although the surface is homogeneously
covered with diamond crystals, these plates are sparsely located (see Figure 4a). The Raman spectrum
consists of the diamond characteristic peak centered at 1329 cm–1 and two broad bands centered at 1388 and 1588 cm–1, known as the D band and the G band, respectively
(Figure 4a). The band
at around 981 cm–1 is attributed to the second order
of silicon.

film deposited at a temperature of 450 °C from a gas mixture

Top-view SEM images and the corresponding Raman spectra of dendritelike
diamond films grown at different deposition temperatures and with
a higher CH4 + CO2 content in a gas mixture
(CH4/CO2/H2 = 5:20:25 sccm). The
Raman spectra were measured with the 325 nm excitation wavelength.

Similar block-stone diamond crystals
have already been prepared
at high temperatures (>850 °C) using the ASTeX resonant cavity
MW plasma enhanced CVD system.50−53 However, high-temperature diamond growth is applicable
only for limited substrate materials, e.g., silicon. Drijkoningen
et al. have recently reported the growth of diamond plates in a linear
antenna microwave plasma system at a lower temperature (410 °C),
using MW continuous wave power of 2.8 kW, a gas mixture of CH4/CO2/H2 (2.5% CH4 and 6%
CO2 to H2), and a low working pressure of 23
Pa.37 The diamond plates were randomly
oriented and were up to 130 nm in height after 18 h. For the prolonged
deposition time (up to 64 h), the individual plates disappeared and
only a continuous layer consisting of microcrystalline diamond grains
was observed. The driving force for the anisotropic growth of the
plates was assigned to the stacking faults present in the early stages
of the diamond growth.36 Drijkoningen et
al. proposed a model in which the formation of diamond plates is related
to silicon atoms, i.e., “impurity traces” coming from
the quartz tubes. Here, Si atoms were involved as a catalyst that
either blocks diamond layer growth or enhances the selective etching
of {111} diamond facets (for details, see ref (37)). Drijkoningen et al.
reported that once the diamond crystals enlarged their size enough,
the plate growth collapsed and microcrystalline grains dominated the
surface morphology of the sample. On the basis of their model, the
growth of thick porous structures (500 nm and larger) therefore seems
to be unfavorable at these process parameters. However, this contrasts
with our findings.

Note that the gas mixture and the total gas
pressure are crucial
process parameters that influence the quality and the morphology of
the diamond films. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that
the addition of a small amount of CO2 to the CH4/H2 gas mixture substantially improved the diamond growth.39 Next, taking into account the Bachmann ternary
diagram, the diamond growth should be suppressed usually at a high
oxygen content (>40% CO2 in the CH4/H2 gas mixture).54 However, the diamond
growth in LAMWP CVD does not strictly follow the Bachmann ternary
diagram and the diamond also grows at higher CO2, i.e.,
outside the forbidden region.55

Another
issue is the total gas pressure in the LAMWP system. At
process pressure >100 Pa, the diamond growth was dominated by the
renucleation mode and the films that formed consisted of nanosized
diamond crystals (<50 nm) with a high content of sp2-bonded carbon on grain boundaries.41 However,
reducing the pressure to 10 Pa (in our case) suppressed the renucleation
mode43 and the crystal size increased in
proportion with the deposition time. In this case, the Raman spectrum
revealed a sharp diamond peak. In this sense, the combination of high
CO2 content (40% to hydrogen) and low process pressure
(10 Pa) allows the formation of a high-quality diamond in a block-stone
form (Figure 4a), whereas
higher CO2 content (80%) results in the formation of a
dendritelike form (Figure 4b). In general, the low working pressure increases the concentration
of atomic hydrogen, thus locating the points on the triangular Bachmann
diagram closer to the hydrogen vertex.56 We assume that the increased CO2 content, i.e., the increased
amount of oxygen-based species (such as CO, CO2, O2, or alcohol) supports the role of atomic hydrogen and has
a beneficial effect on the diamond growth regime. In addition, the
higher CO2 content led to formation of a higher amount
of OH radicals57 and in combination with
a low-pressure regime, it finally switched the diamond growth regime
from a block-stone to dendritelike form. In comparison with the block-stone
diamond, the growth of the dendritelike diamond can be tailored by
the deposition temperature. Although all of the Raman spectra reveal
a high-quality diamond film with just a small amount of sp2 hybridized carbon, some changes can be still observed. The diamond
films deposited at higher temperatures (650 and 550 °C) are characterized
by three Raman features: (i) the diamond peak centered at around 1329
cm–1, (ii) the D band with a maximum at 1388 cm–1, and (iii) the G band at 1585 cm–1. Lowering the deposition temperature resulted in a red-shift of
the diamond peak to a value of 1323 cm–1 and a clear
increase in the diamond peak shoulder around 1250 cm–1. This feature most likely originates from a disordered sp3 phase, which is typically found in dynamically synthesized nanodiamonds
and may be a part of the sp3/sp2 near-surface
stress-releasing transient layer.58

For the growth of isolated diamond nanowires, (111) nanowires were
proposed as the unstable form whereas C(100)(2 × 1) dimer rows
parallel to the axis of the nanowire should ideally fulfill the stability
requirements.59 Theoretical calculations
later showed that certain morphological criteria must be fulfilled
for structurally and thermodynamically stable diamond nanowires or
nanorods.60 This may be the reason why
the chemical and kinetic reactions are in thermodynamic equilibrium
with the etching process and the growth of the preferential crystallographic
orientation. This type of specific equilibrium could also be required
for dendritelike diamond growth, as presented in this work. Dendritelike
diamond growth seems to be driven only by plasmochemical processes
(and not to be influenced by the substrate material), and it does
not collapse into micro- or nanocrystalline diamond growth for prolonged
deposition times.

Further evidence for a plasmo-hemical driven
process is demonstrated
by the dendritelike diamond growth on ultranano- (UNCD) and microcrystalline
(MCD) diamond films. Figure 5a shows a cross-sectional view of a diamond sandwich structure.
The diamond sandwich structure starts with the UNCD base layer, which
was further used as a substrate for the growth of dendritelike diamond.
Finally, the dendritelike porous structure was overgrown with nanocrystalline
diamond (NCD). Figure 5b shows top-view SEM images of individually deposited diamond films
on planar Si substrates (the reference). The dendritelike diamond
growth is not conditioned by the UNCD morphology and reveals the same
morphology as in the previous section (Figure 4b). However, the NCD film well copies the
top profile of the dendritelike diamond layer.

Figure 5 (a) Cross-sectional view
of the diamond sandwich structure (UNCD/dendritelike/NCD)
and the corresponding Raman spectrum of the final sandwich structure.
(b) Top-view SEM images of the diamond structures after an individual
deposition step during fabrication of the sandwich structure, and
(c) the corresponding Raman spectra of the reference diamond films
deposited on silicon substrates measured with the 325 nm excitation
wavelength. (d) Cross-sectional SEM images and the Raman spectrum
measured with the 442 nm excitation wavelength of the MCD/dendritelike
diamond structure.

Figure 5a shows
the Raman spectrum of the final sandwich structure. For comparison, Figure 5c shows the corresponding
Raman spectra of each diamond type deposited on Si substrates. It
is evident that the Raman spectrum of the sandwich structure is primarily
influenced by the UNCD layer. However, the diamond peak intensity
and the contemporaneous lower G band intensity seem to be related
to higher-quality diamond films (dendritelike and NCD films).

Finally, a two-layer compartment of the dendritelike diamond film
(deposited at T = 450 °C) on a rough microcrystalline
diamond film was also fabricated. It is evident from the cross-sectional
SEM images that the dendritelike growth is not disturbed (influenced)
by the base MCD layer (Figure 5d). The Raman spectrum is characterized by three typical features: t-PA, the diamond peak, and the G band. Unlike in the sandwich
structure, the position of the diamond peak (1331 cm–1) is preferentially influenced by the MCD layer (Figure 5d). Finally, it should be noted
that dendritelike diamond growth was also observed on nonseeded Si
substrates, due to spontaneous nucleation (not shown here).

To summarize Section 3.2, the unconventional diamond growth regime that is outside
the Bachmann ternary diagram led to the direct growth of porous block-stone
and dendritelike diamond films. Both of these growth modes are affected
by the low total gas pressure (10 Pa) and by the composition of the
gas, with a high content of CO2 gas (40% CO2 to H2 for porous block-stone and 80% CO2 to
H2 for dendritelike diamond films). The diamond growth
itself is mainly driven by plasmochemical reactions, i.e., it is not
conditioned by the substrate material. Moreover, the dendritelike
diamond growth does not collapse after reaching a certain diamond
film thickness. This is in contrast to the block-stone growth model.37 This unique bottom-up porous diamond growth,
observed only when there is a high CO2 content in the LAMWP
system, is minimally affected by the deposition temperature. In this
sense, the LAMWP system is suitable for porous diamond growth on temperature-sensitive
substrates over a large area. The multilayered structures (sandwich
and two-layer compartment structures) can be prepared within a single
deposition run by simply varying the gas chemistry during the CVD
process. This saves fabrication time. It should be noted that all
of the fabricated and presented diamond-based porous structures were
thick enough to be self-standing.

3.3 Applicability
of Porous Diamond Structures
Generally, porous materials
are of significant interest due to
their wide applications. They can be used for various targets in solar
energy systems containing adsorption materials, thermal energy storage
materials, insulation materials, evaporation materials, or heat transfer
augmentation materials.61 The distribution
of the sizes, shapes, and volumes of the void spaces in porous materials
is directly related to their ability to perform the desired function
in a particular application.62 In addition,
the material of the porous structure itself is a key factor for its
usability. Porous diamond-based structures in various forms, as well
as their applicability, have already been presented as promising electrodes,26 as separators in biotechnology and biomedicine,17 as electrochemical separators,63 and as supercapacitors.32 In
a wider manner, Figure 6 summarizes the classification of porous diamond structures grown
by LAMWP on the basis of their pore sizes and outlines their potential
applicability.

Figure 6 Classification of porous diamond structures by pore size
and their
potential applicability.

Driven by the demand for porous structures based on intrinsic
or
boron-doped diamond, the last two decades have seen an enormous effort
by researchers to prepare and optimize the fabrication procedures.
For example, Kondo et al. reported a two-step thermal treatment method
for the fabrication of porous conductive boron-doped diamond electrodes,64 Ruffinatto et al. reported that heavily boron-doped
diamond porous membranes were fabricated using low-cost commercial
fiber glass filters seeded through the Buchner filtration process,30 Shimoni et al. presented recipes for the creation
of various diamond-based patterns using a lithography-based procedurs,65 and Gao et al. reported the preparation of a
porous diamond foam by a fabrication procedure consisting of several
steps.29 Generally, a complex fabrication
procedure was needed.

In this sense, we believe that our summary
of the fabrication (with
or without a template) of a wide range of 3D porous diamond structures
using the pulsed microwave cold plasma system with a linear antenna
arrangement can promote the potential use of porous diamond in industrial
applications.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, we reviewed two different fabrication approaches
(top-down and bottom-up) of porous diamond structures in one unique
CVD system, the large-area pulsed microwave plasma system with a linear
antenna arrangement. In the first approach, templated diamond growth
on macro-, micro-, and nanoporous substrates was presented. Low-pressure
operation (10 Pa) lengthened the diamond growth in the substrate Z-depth and thus enhanced the penetration of the growth
species into the porous templates. Moreover, thanks to the larger
distance between antennas and substrate, the LAMWP system also enabled
quite homogeneous two-sided deposition growth in the volume of thick
or very dense porous templates within a single deposition run. In
the second approach, the new plasmochemically driven growth for a
high CO2 content (80% to H2) in the gas mixture
led to an unconventional formation of dendritelike diamond films.
This unique bottom-up porous diamond growth was not dependent on the
substrate material, the deposition time, or the film thickness. The
results presented here demonstrate that the large-area pulsed microwave
plasma system with a linear antenna arrangement is a promising and
industrially compatible versatile tool for the fabrication of a great
variety of porous diamond structures in a broad range of temperatures.
