Inspired
by a bacteriogenic, iron-based oxide material and a traditional
Japanese red pigment, a bright yellowish-red pigment was prepared
by heating an Al-containing iron oxyhydroxide precursor. The obtained
red pigment had a unique porous disk-like structure, comprising Al-substituted
hematite particles and crystalline alumina nanoparticles. Although
these disk-like structures loosely gathered to form an aggregate in
powder, they can be easily dispersed into a single, disk-like structure
by simple ultrasonic irradiation. The powder exhibited a bright yellowish-red
color and high thermostability, making it attractive as a coloring
material for various industrial products needing a bright-red color,
high weather resistance, and durability. Quantitative color measurements
revealed extremely high L*, a*,
and b* values that are much greater than those of
commercially available hematite. The thermostability test showed that
even after exposure to high temperatures, the pigment retained the
red color, indicating its high thermostability. The unique microstructure
should be strongly related to the bright yellowish-red color and the
high thermostability of the developed red pigment.

==== Body
Introduction
In modern society,
almost all the daily necessities, such as clothes,
sundries, toys, cosmetics, electrical appliances, vehicles, and buildings,
are colored. Among various colors, red has a special meaning for humans.
A pigment workshop was discovered in an old cave that is around 100,000
years old, and red ochres were detected.1,2 Red pigments
were used to decorate a 73,000-year-old abstract drawing, which was
excavated from the Blombos cave in South Africa; they were used in
prehistoric cave arts found in the caves of Chauvet in France (30,000
years old), Altamira in Spain, and Lascaux and Niaux in France (12,000–17,000
years ago).3−5 In addition, the red color has been regarded as a
symbol of transformation and was used in burials and for decorating
the Venus figurines in the Paleolithic.6 The red pigments used by humans are mainly composed of a simple
iron oxide, α-Fe2O3 (hematite), and humans
used mined hematite ores or heat-treated iron oxyhydroxides.7

Organic pigments generally show vivid colors
and have various color
variations as well as excellent tinting strength. Although organic
pigments are often used to give industrial products an intense and
vivid color, there are some problems: color fading; repainting is
needed when using them for painting applications; and they cannot
be used in high-temperature applications, such as ceramic and asphalt,
because of their chemical instability. On the other hand, inorganic
pigments often do not show vivid colors, although they exhibit extremely
high weather resistance. Hematite—a simple iron oxide that
shows a red color and does not contain toxic elements—has been
excavated from many remains of the Paleolithic.1−4,6 Excavated
hematite retained its red color even after exposure to the natural
environment for several tens of thousands of years—or over
100,000 years—, which proves that oxide pigments are ultimate
weather-resistant pigments that do not rust anymore. However, the
red color of hematite is not vivid and intense; it is actually close
to brown. If a bright-red inorganic pigment can be realized on the
basis of hematite, such a pigment could be used for coloring various
industrial products as a cost-effective, safe, and environmentally
benign weather-resistant pigment.

It is known that the main
absorption in the visible region of hematite
is attributed to the charge transfer transition from the O 2p to Fe
3d levels,8,9 resulting in a red color. In addition, the
color tone of the hematite powder strongly depends on its particle
size and dispersibility: the color can range from red for small and/or
well-dispersed particles to dark gray for large and/or strongly aggregated
particles.10 Therefore, it is quite important,
for obtaining a bright-red color, to precisely control the particle
size and dispersibility. Previously, various red pigments based on
hematite have been developed. Contemporary research on hematite red
pigments has focused on controlling the particle size, distribution,
dispersibility, and nanostructure of hematite, yielding novel red
pigments with bright color and high chemical and/or thermal stabilities.11−37

We have developed novel red pigments based on a unique concept38,39 that differs from conventional approaches. A porous microtubular
structure (∼1 μm in diameter), which is composed of hematite/silicate
composites, can be prepared by heating a bacteriogenic, iron-based
oxide material produced by iron-oxidizing bacteria.38 The hematite particles are covered with amorphous silicate,
and many pores exist between them. The tubular structures do not sinter
strongly, and the hematite particles are highly dispersed in air,
which results in a bright yellowish-red powder. This red pigment does
not show color fading even after exposure to high temperatures of
800 °C. In addition, Al-substituted hematite was synthesized,
inspired by a traditional Japanese red pigment comprising hematite
fine particles incorporating 1 mol % Al, the first artificial red
pigment produced in Japan, showing that Al substitution in the hematite
structure intrinsically enhances lightness and chroma in hematite
color.39 Based on these results, nanocomposite
materials comprising Al-substituted hematite particles and ultrafine,
Fe-substituted, corundum nanoparticles were synthesized, resulting
in a bright yellowish-red color and a high thermostability in color.39

In this study, inspired by both the bacteriogenic,
iron-based material
and the Japanese traditional red pigment, an Al-added low-crystalline
iron oxyhydroxide was synthesized as a precursor, and it was then
heated to obtain a novel bright-red pigment with high thermostability
in color. Especially, we investigated in detail the effect of the
structure (e.g., crystallographic structure and microstructure) on
the color tone and the thermostability of the pigment, comparing it
with the Al-free sample and commercially available hematite.

Experimental
Section
Samples containing Al molar ratios of 0–0.5
[x = Al/(Fe + Al)] in 0.1 increments were prepared
as follows: Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries,
99.9%) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, 99.9%) were used to prepare 0.1 dm3 of 0.5 mol dm–3 solution in total metal amounts.
Then, 0.6 mol NH4HCO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries)
was added to the solution, stirred for 15 min using a propeller agitator
(IKA, Eurostar 20) at 200 rpm, and left to stand for 1 h. The resultant
precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with ∼3
dm3 deionized water and ∼0.05 dm3 ethanol.
The wet pastes were dried under vacuum at room temperature. The obtained
precursor powders were heat-treated by elevating the temperature at
a rate of 10 °C min–1 to 700 °C, kept
for 2 h, and cooled in a furnace. To clarify the effects of heat on
the color tone, the heat-treated samples were reheated at 900–1200
°C for 1 h. A commercially available hematite (Nakalai Tesque,
≥95.0%) sample was used as the reference.

The crystallographic
structures, reflectance spectra and colors,
and microstructures of the obtained powder samples were characterized
by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, MiniFlex600, Rigaku, Japan), spectrophotometry
using the CIE standard illuminant D65 (CM-5, Konica Minolta
Sensing, Japan), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL),
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL, Japan)
coupled with secondary electron detection and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometry (EDS). High-resolution TEM images were acquired in the
TEM mode, while the secondary electron and EDS elemental mapping images
were acquired in the scanning TEM (STEM) mode. The particle size distribution
of the sample was determined using a laser particle size analyzer
(LA-950, HORIBA, Japan). The powder sample was added to a 0.1 wt %
sodium hexametaphosphate aqueous solution, and the measurement was
performed during ultrasonic irradiation for 0–50 min. To determine
the pore size distribution and the specific surface area, the samples
were measured by the nitrogen adsorption method at −196 °C
using a BELSORP-mini-II system (MicrotracBEL, Japan). Prior to the
measurement, all samples were degassed under vacuum for 5 h at 300
°C. Data were analyzed by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method to obtain the pore size distribution and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method to estimate the specific surface area.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
XRD patterns of the precursor and heat-treated samples. The XRD patterns
of all the precursors were similar. Therefore, the pattern of the
Al-free sample is displayed in the bottom of Figure 1. Two broad peaks with 2θ values of
around 35 and 60° were detected for the precursor samples, indicating
the formation of a low-crystalline iron oxyhydroxide of 2-line ferrihydrite
(2Fh).40 Sharp diffraction peaks were detected
as well. Although these peaks have not been assigned, they could be
due to a kind of salt related to Fe3+, nitrate, carbonate,
and/or ammonium ions, which was decomposed by heat treatment.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of the precursor sample with x =
0 (bottom) and heat-treated samples with x = 0–0.5
(upper). Red dotted vertical lines were placed at the diffraction
peaks of (214) and (300) planes for the sample with x = 0 to visually know the peak shift depending on the Al molar ratio.

The color of the precursors was basically brown,
but changed to
a light yellowish-brown upon adding Al and to red after heat treatment. Upon heating
these precursors at 700 °C, a single phase of hematite, which
was assigned by using the powder diffraction file of the Inorganic
Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) 81248, was confirmed for samples
with x ≤ 0.3. In addition to hematite, weak
peaks of AlFeO3 (ICSD 203202) were detected in the samples
with x = 0.4 and 0.5. Diffraction peaks slightly
shifted toward higher angles with increasing Al molar ratios, but
the shift was mostly saturated ≥0.2 (see the high angle around
60–65° using dotted red vertical lines as guidelines),
suggesting lattice parameter change. The lattice parameters a and c of heat-treated samples with monophasic
hematite (x = 0–0.3) were determined by XRD
measurements (Figure 2). The parameters a = 5.038 nm and c = 13.752 nm were calculated for the heat-treated Al-free sample,
which are nearly consistent with the reported values of hematite.
On the other hand, for the heat-treated Al-containing samples, the
parameters were found to be shortened. The ionic radii of six-coordinated
Fe3+ and Al3+ are 0.0645 and 0.0535 nm, respectively,
and the radius of Al3+ is shorter than that of Fe3+. Hence, the shortening of lattice parameters has originated from
the differences in ionic radii. Lattice parameters decreased with
increasing x up to 0.2 and showed nearly constant
values. The amount of Al substitution for the heat-treated sample
with x = 0.2 and 0.3, as calculated using Vegard’s
law, was ∼0.08, which is much lower than the starting composition.
This will be discussed later. The Al substitution value (∼0.08
at 700 °C) is similar to the value reported previously in the
Fe2O3–Al2O3 phase
diagram.39,41

Figure 3 shows the
results of reflectance curves (upper) and quantitative color measurements
(lower) on heat-treated samples with x = 0–0.5.
The results obtained for a reference sample and photographs of the
powders are also shown. All the reflectance spectra showed the typical
profile of hematite; the reflectance value greater than 550 nm enhanced
with the increasing Al molar ratio, and the color systematically changed
depending on the molar ratio of Al (x). The L* value indicating lightness was found to monotonically
increase with increasing x. On the other hand, a* and b* values, whose positive values
show reddish and yellowish colors, respectively, improved with increasing x, thereby showing the brightest yellowish-red color at x = 0.3 and gradually fading at x >
0.3.
The results obtained for a reference sample and photographs of the
powders are also shown. For the heat-treated sample with x = 0 (Al-free sample), the lightness (L* value)
and chroma (a*, and b* values) were
extremely low, with values of L* = 32.9, a* = 11.2, and b* = 4.2. On the other hand,
upon adding Al, for example, with x = 0.3, these
values increased drastically to L* = 48.3, a* = 37.2, and b* = 48.8. A comparison
with a commercially available hematite sample exhibiting a relatively
bright-red color (L* = 38.6, a*
= 30.4, and b* = 21.0) shows an obvious difference,
with the L*, a*, and b* values of the Al-added sample being 1.25, 1.22, and 2.32 times
greater, respectively, than those obtained for the commercially available
sample. Especially, the Al-added sample showed a high b* value, indicating the bright yellowish-red color. To the best of
our knowledge, such a bright yellowish-red color has not been reported
so far in hematite-based pigments. In addition, these values are higher
than those reported in previous literature for red pigments based
on bismuth oxide42 or attapulgite43 and those observed for model materials: the
red pigment prepared by us previously using a bacteriogenic iron oxide
as a precursor38 and yellowish-red Al-substituted
hematite powders prepared by us previously, inspired by Fukiya Bengala,
the first artificial hematite-based red pigment produced in Japan.39 From the absorbance spectra calculated using
the Kubelka–Munk function, f(R) = (1 – R)2/2R, where R is the reflectance, band gap energies
of the commercially available hematite and heat-treated samples with x ≥ 0.2 were roughly estimated to be ∼2.1
and ∼2.15 eV, respectively. The band gap increase, that is,
the absorption edge shifting to lower wavelengths, by Al substitution
supports the enhancement of b* (yellowish) value
in Al-added samples.

Figure 3 Reflectance curves (top); L*, a*, and b* values (bottom); and photographs
(insets
in the lower graph) of heat-treated samples with x = 0–0.5. The results obtained for commercially available
hematite (CA) are also shown.

We performed microscopic observations to clarify the mechanism
responsible for the high lightness and chroma of the Al-added samples
in terms of microstructure. Figure 4 shows the SEM images of heat-treated samples with x = 0–0.5. Primary particles with diameters of 70–160
nm were strongly sintered and aggregated in Al-free sample (x = 0, Figure 4a). Upon increasing the Al molar ratio up to 0.1 (Figure 4b), fine particles were loosely
aggregated to form a crumbling disk-like secondary structure. The
disk-like, secondary structure matured at x ≥
0.2, and its shape and size were not dependent on the Al molar ratio
(Figure 4c–f).
The drastic improvement of a* and b* values in heat-treated samples with x = 0.1 and
0.2, as shown in Figure 3, should be related to the formation of the disk-like structure. Figure 5 shows the detailed
microscopic observations of the precursors and heat-treated samples
with x = 0 and 0.3. The Al-free precursor consisted
of irregularly shaped agglomerates (Figure 5a), whereas disk-like particles with diameters
and thicknesses of 0.4–0.9 and 0.2–0.3 μm, respectively,
were observed in the case of the Al-added precursor (Figure 5b). The shapes of the precursors
were preserved after the heat treatment (Figure 5c,d), indicating that the disk-like structures
were formed in the stage of precursor formation.

The particle size distributions of the Al-added
and subsequently
heat-treated sample (x = 0.3) were measured before
and after ultrasonic irradiation for various periods of time to determine
the dispersibility of the sample (Figure 6a). Although the initial state [before ultrasonic
irradiation: black line (0) in Figure 6a] shows a broad distribution containing large particle
sizes greater than 100 μm, meaning the aggregation of disk-like
particles, this distribution changed to a single distribution, with
a peak maximum of ∼0.7 μm, which is nearly consistent
with the diameter of disk-like particles, and the distribution sharpened
with increasing ultrasonic irradiation time. This result indicates
that the initial aggregated disk-like particles can easily be dispersed
into single particles by a simple treatment. This easily dispersive
character can be a great advantage for industrial pigment applications.

in the figure show ultrasonic irradiation times (min). (b) Pore size
distributions of heat-treated samples with x = 0
(open circles) and 0.3 (solid circles).

The sizes of primary particles composed of irregularly shaped agglomerates
and of disk-like particles estimated from SEM images were 70–160
nm (Figure 5e) and
20–40 nm (Figure 5f) for the Al-free and Al-added samples, respectively, after heat
treatment. These and the above-mentioned XRD results indicate that
the primary particles are hematite. The Al-added sample was observed
in more detail using the secondary electron mode in STEM measurements
(Figure 5g) and high-resolution
TEM measurements (inset to Figure 5g). Interestingly, the disk-like particles were not
just an assembly of hematite particles, and extremely small particles
with diameters of ∼5 nm were dispersed on the surface of the
hematite particles. As noted above, the amount of Al substitution,
calculated from the lattice parameters, was lower than the initial
composition. This result implies that the amount of Al exceeding the
solubility limit of Al in hematite exists as fine particles and/or
in the amorphous state. Actually, the nanoparticles (indicated by
an arrow in Figure 5g) were confirmed by STEM measurements. Hence, these particles could
be an Al-containing oxide. For high-resolution TEM measurements of
nanoparticles, as representatively shown in the inset to Figure 5g, lattice fringes
with a d-spacing value of 2.78 Å, which most
likely correspond to the (112) plane of γ-Al2O3 (ICSD 99836), were observed. Additional characterization
experiments of STEM/EDS analysis (Figure 5h–k) revealed the spatial distribution
of Fe and Al elements. The signal of Fe was detected only from hematite
particles with diameters of 20–40 nm (Figure 5i). On the other hand, the signal of Al was
detected from hematite particles as well as from surface nanoparticles
with a diameter of ∼5 nm (Figure 5j). The merged elemental mapping image (Figure 5k, red: Fe and green:
Al) clearly shows the distribution. On the basis of these microscopic
experiments, we confirmed that the nanoparticles observed using STEM
(Figure 5g) were crystalline
transition alumina such as the γ-phase. Moreover, Al-substitution
in the hematite structure was directly evidenced by elemental analysis,
in addition to the shrinkage of lattice parameters (Figure 2).

The STEM images shown
in Figure 5f,g indicate
that the hematite particles were not densely
sintered in disk-like particles—and there are many fine spaces
between the hematite particles—suggesting a specific porous
structure for the disk-like particles. The porous structure of the
heat-treated sample with x = 0.3 was analyzed by
the nitrogen adsorption method (Figure 6b), which demonstrated that the sample had a large
specific surface area of ∼60 m2 g–1 and numerous mesopores with diameters ranging from 2 to 190 nm.
In addition, characteristic mesopores with local peak maxima of ∼20,
∼45, and ∼90 nm were observed, which are presumably
related to the interspaces generated by the primary hematite particles
inside the disk-like particles and the interspaces generated by the
assembly of disk-like particles.

These results show that the
bright yellowish-red pigment synthesized
in this study is composed of disk-like structures with diameters of
0.4–0.9 μm and thicknesses of 0.2–0.3 μm,
which contain Al-substituted hematite particles with diameters of
20–40 nm and crystalline alumina nanoparticles with diameters
of ∼5 nm; there are also many pores with diameters of 2–190
nm in the disk-like structures. The following four points could be
the possible reasons for realizing high L*, a*, and b* values: (i) the particle size
of hematite is small; (ii) the Fe3+ species in hematite
are partly substituted by Al3+; (iii) crystalline alumina
nanoparticles are tightly attached to hematite particles; and (iv)
nanocomposites of hematite/alumina are loosely connected to form disk-like
structures. The formation mechanism of the disk-like particles in
the precursor has not been clarified yet, but the structure is observed
only in the Al-added precursor. Hence, Al addition into the starting
solution is a key factor for the formation of disk-like particles.

To study the thermostability, the heat-treated sample with x = 0.3 was reheated at 900–1200 °C for 1 h,
and the color change was assessed. For comparison, commercially available
hematite was heated in the same manner as a reference. The variations
in a* and b* values are shown in Figure 7 and SEM images of
the samples after thermostability test are shown in Figure 8. The a* and b* values decreased as the heating temperature increased
for both samples. The main reason for color fading should be the particle
growth of hematite, as shown in Figure 8. For the reference sample, a* and b* values decreased drastically and reached extremely low
values of a* = 22.8 and b* = 11.2
at 900 °C, and the color changed to nearly black at 1100 °C.
The particle size of the reference sample grew from 60–300
to 120–440 nm at 900 °C and to 160–920 nm at 1100
°C (Figure 8d–f).
On the other hand, for the Al-added sample, although the b* value slightly decreased upon heating at 900 °C, they still
remained high (a* = 39.8 and b*
= 45.7). These values are much greater than those observed for the
as-received reference sample. The disk-like particles were preserved
even at 900 °C, and the primary particle size grew from 20–40
nm before reheating to 50–150 nm at 900 °C (Figure 8a,b); this size is even smaller
than that of the as-received reference sample. At high temperatures
of 1100 °C, the reference sample showed a nearly black color,
while the Al-added sample showed much higher a* and b* values (35.7 and 33.5) to those of the as-received reference
sample. After reheating at 1100 °C, disk-like particles disappeared
and the particle size grew to 100–400 nm (Figure 8c), which is larger than that
of the as-received reference sample. At 1200 °C, although the a* and b* values were slightly lower than
those observed for the as-received reference sample, the Al-added
sample even retained the red color, regardless of its large particle
size of 190–500 nm, suggesting that additional Al substitution
enhanced the red color. To confirm this suggestion, XRD measurements
were carried out. Figure 9a shows the XRD patterns and Figure 9b shows the variation of lattice parameters
for the samples after thermostability test. Diffraction peaks of α-Al2O3 (corundum) were detected in addition to hematite,
and the XRD peaks of hematite sharpened concomitantly with the shifting
of the hematite peak toward higher angles. These results indicate
that the transition-phase of crystalline alumina nanoparticles observed
on the hematite surface transformed into the thermodynamically stable
α-phase, the crystallite size of hematite grew, and the crystalline
alumina nanoparticles reacted with hematite to enhance Al-substitution
in hematite during the thermostability test. The lattice parameters, a and c, were both shortened and the value
decreased with increasing temperature (Figure 9b). The additional Al-substitution to hematite
should suppress the reduction in color values at high temperatures
even though it was accompanied by strong particle growth.

available hematite (CA) after reheating at
900–1200 °C for 1 h.

Figure 9 (a) XRD patterns and (b) lattice parameters of the heat-treated
sample with x = 0.3 after reheating at 1000 °C

the diffraction peaks of (214) and (300) planes for the sample with x = 0.3 before reheating to visually know the peak shift
depending on the reheating temperature.

The red pigment synthesized in this study shows extremely high
thermostability in color. This excellent thermostability is because:
(i) the particle size of hematite after reheating is much smaller
than that of typical hematite, when heat-treated at the same temperature,
as the starting hematite particles are quite small (20–40 nm);
(ii) excessive particle growth could be suppressed by crystalline
alumina nanoparticles on the hematite surface, which act as a sintering
inhibitor; (iii) excessive color fading in hematite resulting from
particle growth could be partly canceled by the effect of additional
Al substitution, which enhances the lightness and chroma in hematite,
during reheating. In addition, the pigment showed reasonably good
chemical stability in base, salt, organic solvent, and alcoholic solutions,
whereas it is slightly unstable in strong acid solutions (see Table
S1 in the Supporting Information).

The bright yellowish-red pigment synthesized in this study can
be used not only for ceramic applications involving high temperatures,
but also for the coloring of cosmetics, glasses, plastics, cars, smartphones,
and so on. If this pigment can replace a part of unstable organic
pigments, extremely stable red coloring will be realized in terms
of weather resistance and durability. In addition, using the numerous
pores formed in the disk-like structure as active and/or storage sites
could enable application of this material in new application fields—besides
coloring—in which hematite has not been used yet.

Conclusions
To obtain a red pigment based on hematite exhibiting high lightness
and chroma, an Al-added iron oxyhydroxide was prepared through a wet
process; then, the obtained precursor was heat-treated at 700 °C
to obtain a hematite-based red powder. The powder sample was evaluated
by spectrophotometry, XRD, electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption
method. The Al-added precursor was basically a low-crystalline iron
oxyhydroxide, 2-line ferrihydrite, with some iron-, nitrate-, carbonate-,
and/or ammonium-ion-related salts. The Al-added and subsequently heat-treated
sample with x = 0.3, which was mainly composed of
hematite, showed an extremely bright yellowish-red color with L* = 48.3, a* = 37.2, and b* = 48.8; these values are 1.25, 1.22, and 2.32 times greater than
those of commercially available hematite. Microscopic observations
combined with the nitrogen adsorption method revealed that the microstructure
of the Al-added and subsequently heat-treated sample is composed of
micrometer-sized, disk-like structures containing Al-substituted hematite
particles and crystalline alumina nanoparticles—and there are
many fine pores in these disk-like structures. Such a unique microstructure
is strongly related to the bright yellowish-red color. Additionally,
Al-added and subsequently heat-treated sample showed excellent thermostability
in color, so that the sample retained relatively high values of a* = 35.7 and b* = 33.5, even after exposure
to high temperatures of 1100 °C. The obtained bright yellowish-red
pigment, which exhibits excellent thermostability, can be used in
diverse coloring applications, especially in those needing thermostability,
weather resistance, and durability.
