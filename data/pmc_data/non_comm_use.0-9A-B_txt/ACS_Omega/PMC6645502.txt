Glycol ethers, or glymes, have been
recognized as good candidates
as solvents for lithium–air batteries because they exhibit
relatively good stability in the presence of superoxide radicals.
Diglyme (bis(2-methoxy-ethyl)ether), in spite of its low donor number,
has been found to promote the solution mechanism for the formation
of Li2O2 during the discharge reaction, leading
to large deposits, that is, high capacities. It has been suggested
that lithium salt association in these types of solvents could be
responsible for this behavior. Thus, the knowledge of the speciation
and transport behavior of lithium salts in these types of solvents
is relevant for the optimization of the lithium–air battery
performance. In this work, a comprehensive study of lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate
(LiTf) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in
1,2-di-methoxyethane (DME) and diglyme, over a wide range of concentrations,
have been performed. Consistent ion pairs and triplet ions formation
constants have been obtained by resorting to well-known equations
that describe the concentration dependence of the molar conductivities
in highly associated electrolytes, and we found that the system LiTf/DME
would be the best to promote bulky Li2O2 deposits.
Unexpected differences are observed for the association constants
of LiTf and, to a lesser extent, for LiTFSI, in DME and diglyme, whose
dielectric constants are similar. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
allowed us to rationalize these differences in terms of the competing
interactions of the O-sites of the ethers and the SOx groups of the corresponding anions with Li+ ion.
The limiting Li+ diffusivity derived from the fractional
Walden rule agrees quite well with those obtained from MD simulations,
when solvent viscosity is conveniently rescaled.

1 Introduction
Theoretically,
lithium–air batteries (LABs) would have a
far higher energy density than any conventional battery system available.1,2 One of the main barriers for developing a commercially available
LAB lies in the choice of the electrolyte, as this has to meet certain
requirements, including low volatility, low viscosity, high ionic
conductivity, and high chemical and electrochemical stability.3 Low viscosity will ensure high ionic and oxygen
transport but, as Angell and co-workers4 quoted, all nonaqueous solvents that combine the desired low volatility
with high salt dissociation power (high dielectric constant or high
Lewis basicity) are always rather viscous. This is due to the unfortunate
correlation between fluidity and volatility, as predicted by Eyring’s
theory of viscosity, which holds for a wide selection of solvents.

The electrolytes employed in Li-ion batteries, based on alkyl carbonates,
were initially tested for LAB.5−7 However, experimental and theoretical
studies have shown that the main cathodic discharge product was not
Li2O2 but a number of lithium insoluble salts
derived from the nucleophilic attack of the superoxide radicals, O2–, on the carbonates.8−10 Abraham and
co-workers11 emphasized the role of the
solvent donor number (DN) on the stability of the Li+–O2– ion pair by studying the solvents dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (ACN), and the glymes dimethoxyethane
(DME) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME).

This
effect was further investigated by Bruce and co-workers12 by comparing the solvents DMSO, ACN, DME, and
1-methylimidazole (Me-Im). They concluded that low-DN solvents are
likely to lead to premature cell death, whereas high-DN solvents,
like Me-Im and DMSO, can support higher capacities and can better
sustain battery discharges. Although DMSO/LiClO4 exhibit
good discharge/charge for 100 cycles when a nanoporous gold cathode
is used in place of a carbon-based one,13 several studies have indicated that DMSO is chemically unstable
in the presence of Li2O2, and attempts to reproduce
the cyclability of LABs employing DMSO-based electrolytes have failed.14−16

The recent interest in glymes as electrolytes for LAB is based
on their relatively low volatility and the fact that the main discharge
product is Li2O2.10,17,18 Freuenberger et al.17 proposed
that glymes suffer O2–-induced decomposition
during discharge, whereas Bryantsev et al.19 have shown that monoglyme (DME) is stable against O2– attack. These contradictory results on the stability
of the glyme under LAB discharge conditions led to Schwenke et al.20 to perform stability studies on glymes of various
chain lengths, using K2O as a superoxide radical source.
They demonstrated that mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-glyme (CH3–O–(CH2–CH2–O)n–CH3, with n = 1–4) are sufficiently stable against superoxide attack
if they are pure enough. It has also been shown that equimolar mixtures
of tri- or tetraglyme with lithium salts has ionic-liquid-like characteristics
at room temperature, but there are no reports of their use in LABs.21 Du et al.22 have
observed that LiPF6 decomposes in tri(ethylene glycol)-substituted
trimethylsilane, but it is stable in TEGDME.

The mechanism of
formation of Li2O2 in the
LAB cathode determines its thickness and morphology and, because it
is a band gap insulator and insoluble in aprotic solvents, this has
a crucial influence on the capacity of the battery. According to Bruce
and co-workers,12 there are two pathways
for the Li2O2 formation during the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) in a LAB. The surface mechanism involves two successive
one-electron reductions leading to the formation of lithium superoxide
(Li2O) intermediary, which finally converts to Li2O2 on the surface. The solution mechanism consist of the
formation of the superoxide ion (O2–),
which forms ion pairs and higher aggregates with Li+ ions
in the solution, which diffuse before chemical disproportion into
Li2O2. Thus, the solution mechanism prompts
the formation of a thick layer of Li2O2, without
the limitations of the electrochemical surface pathway, due to the
insulating nature of the deposit that self-limits its growth.

Solvents with high DN promote the solution mechanism by reducing
the Lewis acidity of the Li+ ion and helping to increase
the stability of the superoxide ion, promoting large Li2O2 deposits; on the other hand, solvents with low DN promote
the surface mechanism, leading to thin films (5–10 nm in thickness).12

Recently, Aurbach and co-workers23 found
a strong correlation between the dissociation degree of the Li+ ion and the ORR behavior, even more important than the DN
one, when diglyme is used as a solvent. They concluded that a “bottom-up”
Li2O2 precipitation mechanism operates with
highly dissociated Li salts (such as LiTFSI) in the low-DN diglyme
where the Li+ ion, weakly coordinated to the counteranion,
will associate to a superoxide to form unstable LiO2, which,
in turn, converts into Li2O2 by chemical disproportionation,
or electrochemically via the transfer of a second electron. These
processes take place near the cathode, leading to a full coverage
of its surface with Li2O2. Once a few peroxide
layers are formed, the electrons cannot penetrate further and the
discharge process stops.

A “top-down” Li2O2 precipitation
mechanism occurs with highly associated salts (such as LiNO3) in diglyme. In this case, the Li+ ion, strongly coordinated
to its counteranion, is less acidic and exhibits a reduced affinity
toward the metastable superoxide anion, which is now able to move
away from the cathode surface before being associated to a Li+ ion to form LiO2, which then disproportionates
into Li2O2. Through this mechanism, the Li2O2 growth can expand in all directions. The higher
the strength of the ionic association of the Li+ ions with
the counteranion, the longer the superoxide is stabilized and can
diffuse far from the cathode surface without forming LiO2.23 These results are consistent with
those reported by Burke et al.,24 who found
a higher LAB discharge capacity using a mixture of LiNO3 and LiTFSI, dissolved in DME, with a high NO3–/TFSI– ratio.

These observations have triggered
the interest in the study of
the ion association of lithium salts in solvents relevant for LABs
in the quest for identifying the best descriptors for solvent stability
and discharge capacity in nonaqueous LABs.25 The experimental criteria commonly adopted for estimating the relative
association degree of LABs electrolytes in promoting the top-down
Li2O2 deposition mechanism is based on the comparison
of the specific conductivity in concentrated solutions,23 which could lead to contradictory results, as
we will demonstrate in this work.

Here, we report precise measurements
of the ionic conductivity
of two lithium salts (LiTf and LTFSI) in the glymes 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(DME) and bis(2-methoxy-ethyl)ether (diglyme) (Figure 1) over a wide range of concentrations, which
allowed us to obtain reliable values of transport parameters, along
with the ion pairs and triplet ions formation constants, in these
electrolyte systems of relevance for LAB. These experimental measurements
were complemented with microscopic interpretations of the differences
in the dynamic and association parameters provided from molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations of the four systems, yielding a comprehensive
picture of the factors that determine the ionic mobilities and ionic
association in these low-dielectric-constant solvents.

salts and glymes studied in this work.

2 Results and Discussion
This section is organized
as follows: first, the results of the
molar electrical conductivity of the four systems studied are reported
and analyzed; second, the speciation calculated from the measured
molar conductivity using different conductivity models is discussed;
next, we present a microscopic insight into the speciation in these
systems on the basis of the MD simulations. Finally, we analyze the
main features of the ionic diffusion in glymes by comparing the experimental
diffusion coefficients, derived from the conductivity data, with the
MD simulations.

2.1 Molar Conductivities of Lithium Salts in Glymes
as a Function of Concentration
The conductivity measurements
were carried out over a wide range of concentrations ranging from
(1–3) × 10–5 M up to 1.0 M for LiTFSI
and up to 1.5 M for LiTf in both glymes. Table S1 in the Supporting Information summarizes the results obtained
for the four system studied, whereas Figure 2a,b illustrate the concentration dependence
of the molar conductivity.

Figure 2 Molar conductivity of (a) LiTf and (b) LiTFSI
in DME and diglyme
at 298.15 K, along with the data by Petrowsky et al.26 (red triangle up solid) for the system LiTf/diglyme (2.72
mM < c < 3.3 M), by Brouillette et al.27 (red and blue lines) for LiTFSI/DME (0.074 M
< c < 2.8 M), and LiTFSI/diglyme (0.0085 M
< c < 1.4 M).

In Figure 2a,b are
also plotted the conductivity data reported by Petrowsky et al.26 for the system LiTf/diglyme and Brouillette
et al.27 for the LiTFSI/DME and the LiTFSI/diglyme
systems. The concentration range of LiTFSI reported by Brouillette
et al.27 in both glymes does not cover
the diluted region, which is necessary to obtain information on the
association constants. The same observation applies to the Petrowsky
et al.26 data for the system LiTf/diglyme,
but, as we will discuss in what follows, the association constants
reported in that study were obtained using a different approach from
the one adopted here.

The general form of the conductivity vs
concentration curve is
typical of a strongly associated electrolyte, where the molar conductivity
reaches values much lower than the infinite dilution upper value,
even at very low concentrations, due to the high value of the ion-pair
association constant, KA, corresponding
to the equilibrium:  In strongly
associated electrolytes, the reduction
of the conductivity due to the formation of neutral ion pairs is more
important that the decreasing of ionic mobility due to the ion–ion
interactions described by the Onsager limiting law or the extended
theories valid up to higher concentrations. As the salt concentration
increases, the formation of triplet ions becomes relevant, operated
via the following processes:  Thus, the population of charged triplets increases,
whereas that of ion pairs decreases, leading to a minimum in the conductivity
vs concentration curve. The observed maximum in the curve as the concentration
is further increased partially obeys the formation of larger aggregates
(as ion quadruplets) and also the decrease of ionic mobilities due
to the increasing viscosity of the media at very high concentrations,
reducing the molar conductivity.

It can be observed that the
minimum in molar conductivities occurs
at concentrations around 0.02 M for all the electrolytes, whereas
the maximum in the concentrated region lies around 1 M for LiTf/DME,
0.5 M for LiTf/diglyme and LiTFSI/DME, and 0.3 M for LiTFSI/diglyme.
The minimum conductivity concentration is related to the constant KT,28 suggesting that
the value of this parameter would be similar for the Li salts measured
in this work, and also for the LiBF4/DME system measured
by Barthel et al.,29 which exhibits a minimum
molar conductivity at 0.021 M at 298 K.

2.2 Speciation
of Lithium Salts in DME and Diglyme
from Conductivity Data
Ionic association is expected to dominate
the concentration dependence of lithium salts conductance in DME and
diglyme considering the low dielectric constant of these solvents
(see Table S2). The cluster theory of electrolytes,30 an extension of the Bjerrum model of ion pairing,
considers that the critical parameter that determines the degree of
ion association
of an electrolyte is the reduced temperature 1  where ze is the ionic charge
(we consider symmetric electrolytes with z+ = |z–| = z), k is the Boltzmann’s constant, T is the temperature, ε is the solvent relative dielectric constant,
and σ = r+ + r– is the mean ionic diameter.

For LiTf and LiTFSI
in DME and diglyme at 298.15 K, T* ranges between
0.046 and 0.067 using the crystal ionic radius calculated according
to the method proposed by Okan and Champeney31 (0.090, 0.307, and 0.450 nm for Li+, Tf–, and TFSI–, respectively). This reduced temperature
is quite low and leads us to predict that the speciation in such electrolytes
should be influenced by the formation of ion pairs, triplet ions,
or even higher ion clusters at the high lithium concentration regime
used in lithium batteries, as it was effectively reported in several
cases.26,27,29

The
association constants KA and KT can be obtained from the concentration dependence
of the molar conductivities by resorting to the well-known equations
developed by Fuoss and Kraus (FK),32 Fuoss–Hsia–Fernández-Prini
(FHFP),33,34 and Salomon and Uchiyama,35 which are discussed in the Supporting Information. In all the cases, the distance of the closest
approach of ions, d, needs to be known, along with
the limiting molar conductivity of the salt, Λ0,
and that of the triple ions, Λ30, to obtain KA and KT. In strongly associated electrolytes, like
those studied in this work, the molar conductivity of the most diluted
solution is too far from Λ0, even for the solution
with concentrations close to 10–5 mol dm–3. Therefore, Λ0 cannot be obtained by extrapolating
the conductivity data at infinite dilution. In the Supporting Information, we describe in detail the procedure
used to obtain Λ0, which is based on the use of the
fractional Walden rule36 (eq S14 in the Supporting Information), whereas the limiting
molar conductivity of the triple ions is approached by Λ30 = 2Λ0/3.37 The infinite-dilution conductivities
of Li+, Tf–, and TFSI– in both solvents at 298.15 K are summarized in Table S4. The infinite-dilution conductivities of LiTf and
LiTFSI in both solvents were calculated from the ionic contributions
by resorting to Kohlrausch’s law (eq S15 in the Supporting Information).

To determine the speciation
of lithium salts in DME and diglyme
from the conductivity data reported in Table S1, we used the FK and FHFP equations (eqs S8 and S1). The best-fit association constants obtained for the studied
systems are summarized in Table 1, where we include the range of concentrations used
in the data fit procedure.

The ion-pair association
constant of the studied systems are plotted
in Figure 3 as a function
of the inverse of the solvent dielectric constant, along with the
data reported in literature in other solvents over a wide range of
dielectric constants (see Table S4 in the
Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Ion-pair formation constant of several Li salts
as a function of
the inverse of the solvent dielectric constant: LiTFSI (blue circle
solid); LiTf (red circle solid); LiAsF6 (○); and
LiBF4 (●). The stars represent the data measured
in this work.

Figure 3 includes
the results for LiAsF6 and LiBF4, which have
been studied in several solvents with ε < 10. As expected,
from the simple Bjerrum’s ion association theory, log KA varies linearly with ε–1 for LiAsF6 and LiBF4. That behavior is not
so clear for LiTf and LiTFSI due to the lack of information on ion
association in solvents with low dielectric constant (ε <
10). In fact, a very large difference is observed for KA in the case of LiTf in DME and diglyme (see Table 2), although they have
almost identical dielectric constants. Although the differences are
not as large as in the case of LiTf, a similar trend is observed for
LiTFSI in those solvents.

LiTf/DME	–17 ± 2	–29.7	
LiTFSI/DG	–9 ± 2	–12.5	
LiTFSI/DME	–11 ± 4	–13.4	
Therefore, it seems that
a simple electrostatic model of ion association
is unable to explain the behavior of the studied systems. We will
advance in the discussion of this behavior in Section 2.3.

It is possible to explain the conductivity
trends observed all
over the wide range of concentrations studied by resorting to the
salt speciation and solvent viscosity. At infinity dilution, where
the salts are fully dissociated, the ionic conductivities follow Walden’s
rule, that is, the ionic conductivity is proportional to the inverse
of the product of the ion radius times the solvent viscosity. Thus,
the conductivities of the three ions in DME are almost double the
corresponding values in diglyme because the viscosity of this solvent
is double that of DME. On the other hand, in both solvents, the conductivity
of the smaller Tf– ion is larger than that of the
bulkier TFSI– ion. At this limiting concentration,
the expected order of conductivities is LiTf/DME > LiTFSI/DME >
LiTf/DG
> LiTFSI/DG, in agreement with the results reported in Table 1.

However, Figure 2a,b shows that even
at concentrations as low as 10–5 M, the conductivity
order changes to LiTFSI/DME > LiTFSI/DG > LiTf/DG
> LiTf/DME. This order can be explained by resorting to the speciation
summarized in Table 2, which reveals that the system LiTf/DME is by far more associated
than the others, so it becomes the less conducting of the four systems
over the whole concentration range. It is also observed that the conductivity
of LiTf in DME is lower than that in diglyme, but the opposite occurs
for LiTFSI. This behavior can be rationalized by considering the opposite
effects of increasing ionic association and solvent fluidity (decreasing
viscosity). The difference in ion-pair association of LiTf between
DME and diglyme (as determined by KA)
overpasses the differences of viscosities, whereas in the case of
LiTFSI, the differences in the ion-pair association in both solvents
are not so large and the differences in viscosities determine the
conductivity order. In Section 2.3, we will analyze the molecular interpretation of the
speciation differences in the four systems.

It is also interesting
to compare our results of speciation and
conductivity in the system LiTf/diglyme and LiTf/DME with those reported
in literature. Petrowsky et al.26 have
calculated the ionic speciation of the LiTf/diglyme system by resorting
to IR spectroscopy. They observed three IR bands assigned to (i) free
Tf– anion, (ii) Li+Tf– ion pairs + triple anion (LiTf2–),
and (iii) LiTf dimer + triple cation (Li2Tf+). However, it was arbitrarily assumed that triple ions are absent,
and the bands were assigned to free ions, ion pairs, and dimers (Li2Tf2); that is, the speciation is thought to be
determined by the ion-pair process (KA) and dimers’ formation (2LiTf ↔ Li2Tf2), characterized by the equilibrium constant KD. Both constants were calculated as a function of concentration,
using the species relative concentrations derived from the IR spectra,
and the molar conductivity was calculated with the concentration of
free ions, cf, at each salt concentration, c 2  where ui are the
ionic mobilities (λi = Fui). By fitting the sum of Li+ and Tf– ions mobilities to the experimental molar conductivity, Petrowsky
et al.26 concluded that the concentration
dependence of the molar conductivity is to a major extent due to the
variation in ion mobilities with concentration. Surprisingly, for
concentrations lower than 0.5 M, the sum of the ionic mobilities increases
with increasing salt concentration, in contradiction with the expected
behavior, taking into account the existence of ion–ion interactions
and the increment in the solution viscosity, which is expected to
slow down ionic mobility. This unexpected behavior is due, without
doubt, to the scheme of ionic association proposed by Petrowsky et
al.,26 which derives from an arbitrary
choice of the predominant species instead of resorting to conductivity
models, like those used in this work, that are based on a reasonable
physical behavior of ionic mobilities with concentration.

Claude-Montigny
et al.38 have calculated
the speciation in LiTf/diglyme at temperatures between 253 and 343
K by a direct fitting of the conductivity data in the concentration
range 10−6−10−3 M, considering
the formation ion pairs and triple ions and assuming the validity
of the Walden rule. Even when they neglected the ion–ion interactions
effects at the concentrations used in the calculation, their results
at 298 K yield KA = (4.0 ± 0.5) ×
105, which compares reasonably well with the one obtained
in this work (see Table 1). This is due to a compensation of errors because they estimated
a much lower Λ0 of LiTf in diglyme than that calculated
in this work and, as we will demonstrate in a forthcoming work, the
Walden rule is not obeyed in these low-dielectric-constant solvents
exhibiting a strong ion association.

Siekierski and co-workers39,40 determined the association
constant of LiTf in DME and diglyme from the conductivity data of 7Li and 19F NMR chemical shift analysis. Unfortunately,
neither the temperature of the experiments nor the Λ0 used for the FK treatment was indicated. The molar conductivities
reported by the authors for the LiTf/DME system are considerably higher
than those depicted in Figure 2a and, consequently, the reported association constant is
4 orders of magnitude lower than that found in our study. The values
of KA reported for LiTf in DME and diglyme
are completely different, depending on whether they were obtained
from 19F NMR (≈1.6 × 104 dm3 mol–1) or 7Li NMR (>106 dm3 mol–1). These anomalies,
together
with the doubts about the quality of NMR spectra at low concentrations,
and the water content of the solvents make the comparison with our
results irrelevant.

In summary, we conclude that the best description
of the speciation
of the lithium salts in glymes arises from the conductivity equations,
like FK and FHFP, which account for the ion–ion interactions
and the formation of ion pairs and triplet ions in the dilute and
moderate-concentration regions, instead of expressions based on mostly
arbitrary ionic species distributions estimated from spectroscopy
data.

At this point, it will be useful to discuss the criteria
adopted
by Aurbauch and co-workers23 to classify
the association strengths of different lithium salts in diglyme, already
mentioned in Section 1, that are based on the measurement of the conductivities of the
corresponding 1 M salt solutions. The simple observation of Tables 2 and S1 seems to indicate that such a criterion is
not generally applicable, except when one compares different salts
in the same solvent. Thus, the specific conductivities of 1 M LiTf
in diglyme and DME are practically the same, (i.e., 2.7 and 2.8 mS
cm–1, respectively), even though the association
constants differ by a factor 30; in contrast, the conductivity of
1 M LiTFSI in DME is almost 50% higher than that of 1 M LiTFSI in
diglyme in spite of the fact that the association constant of TFSI
in diglyme is a factor 3 larger than that in DME. Therefore, we conclude
that the simple comparison of the specific conductivities of 1 M electrolyte
solutions does not reflect the real ionic association of the lithium
salts because it does not account for the solvent viscosity effects.

From the point of view of the influence of the ion association
on the extension of the discharge capacity of a LAB, the system LiTf/DME,
having an association constant 30–1800 times higher than the
other three electrolytes, would be recommended to promote large (probably
toroidal shape) Li2O2 discharge deposits through
a top-down mechanism, as proposed by Aurbauch and co-workers.23

2.3 Lithium Salt Speciation
from MD Simulation
At first glance, given the similarities
between the dielectric
characteristics of diglyme and DME, the changes in the association
constants reported in Table 2—most notably, the 2 orders of magnitude difference
between the LiTf results in the two solvents—are puzzling.
Looking for physical interpretations of this feature, we performed
a series of simulation experiments to estimate the values of KA from an alternative microscopic perspective.
The simplest and most direct route to perform such an analysis relies
on the examination of the potential of mean force, W(ξ), for solvated ionic species. In the present case, to do
so, we resorted to the adaptive biasing force methodology, as implemented
in the NAMD simulation software (see the Supporting Information for a description of the procedure) using the cation–anion
distance as a reaction coordinate, i.e., ξ = r. The results are displayed in the two panels included in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Potential of mean force
for LiTf (left panel) and LiTFSI (right
panel) in DME (blue curves) and diglyme (red curves). The dot-dashed
lines represent the macroscopic screened Coulomb decay (see text).

The gross features of the four
plots can be interpreted in terms
of three distinctive behaviors: (i) at short interionic distances,
the curves present deep minima (of the order 15–30 kT), corresponding to strongly bounded contact-ion-pair
(CIP) configurations; (ii) as one moves toward larger distances, one
can also observe secondary, much shallower, minima at r ≈ 7 Å, which correspond to marginally stable solvent-separated-ion-pair
(SSIP) configurations; (iii) finally, beyond the latter distances,
the curves progressively loose structure and decay to zero following
the expected, −e2/(rε)−1, macroscopic behavior. Note that similarities
in the dielectric behavior of the two solvents are clearly reflected
in the practically unified decays of all the curves beyond, say, 15
Å.

Following previous studies, estimates for KA can be readily obtained from41 3  where ξ represents the position of the
barrier separating CIP from SSIP configurations.

Results of
the equilibrium constant, expressed in terms of the
Gibbs free energy changes for the association process, namely, 4  where K* = 1 dm3 mol–1, and of the experimental association constants
are listed in columns 2 and 3 of Table 2, respectively.

A direct inspection of the entries
reveals that simulation results
reproduce the association trends found experimentally, although they
strongly overestimate the energetics of the associated ion pairs by
several kT, most notably in the strongest associated
cases involving LiTf. As such, we are led to conclude that the simulation
predictions should be regarded only as qualitative estimators. We
remark that, somehow, this drawback could have been anticipated if
one takes into account previous theoretical calculations of the electronic
structure of LiTf in diglyme,42 which revealed
that a considerable extent of charge transfer—of the order
of 0.5e—occurs at contact-ion-pair configurations.
Consequently, any analysis based on pseudopotentials that neglect
local polarization fluctuations will necessarily overestimate the
interionic Coulomb attractions, yielding association constants that
are too high.

Despite this drawback, the simulated profiles
of W(r) still might provide key
elements to rationalize
the differences in the degree of ionic association in the two solvents.
The analysis of the LiTf curves that appear on the top panel of Figure 5 will be instructive.
More specifically, we will focus attention on the structures of the
curves at short interionic distances that appear in the inset. In
the two plots, one clearly perceives the presence of two local minima
at r = 2.5 and 3.25 Å (hereafter referred to
as configurations of types A and B, respectively).

integrals. DG (DME) results are shown in the top (bottom). O: green
lines and circles; methylene C (−CH2−): red
lines and triangles, methyl C (−CH3): blue lines
and squares. The numbers indicate site populations in the first solvation
shell of Li+ ion.

Before analyzing this feature, it will be useful to briefly
digress
on the characteristics of the solvation of isolated Li+ ions in these solvents.

An analysis based on the pair correlation
functions that appear
in Figure 5 reveals
that, in agreement to previous Monte Carlo,43 density functional theory,44 and MD45−47 results, the solvation structures of the cation in both glymes can
be cast in terms of octahedral arrangements, with six O-sites tightly
bound to the ion. For the longer diglyme, the closest solvation shell
involves two solvent molecules, whereas for the shorter DME, the latter
number moves up to three.

Interestingly, our simulations reveal
that this coordination of
the cation with the environment articulated via six O-sites is preserved
even at short interionic distances. However, contrasted to the previous
isolated Li+ case, the local structures of CIP involve
two types of modifications, as shown in the snapshots of Figure 6: for the specific
case of DME, one observes the exchange of two of the original ether-O
sites by other two “equivalent” ones (composing the
SO3 group of the counterion) equally shared in a straddled-like
structure of type A. On the other hand, solvation structures of CIP
of type B involves the exchange of only one original ether-O site
by one of the counterion in a linear-like S–O···Li+ coordination.

The direct inspection of the relative
stabilities of the two structures
and the positions of the corresponding local minima in the two solvents,
shown in the inset of Figure 4, clearly demonstrate that the effective interionic attraction
should be milder in DG than in DME. As such, we are led to conclude
that the sources of the observed differences in the extent of ionic
association might be ascribed to the details of an intricate balance
between ion–ion and ion–solvent interactions that would
benefit either one of the two possible contact-ion-pair coordinations,
depending of the particular solvent considered. On the other hand,
the plots in the right panel of Figure 4 reveal a much less clear stabilization of the above-mentioned
solvation structures. This is not unexpected given the wider variety
of length scales describing the solvation structure Li-TFSI pairs
where, for example, the ion–ion coordination of type A is articulated
via a pair of O-sites, each one located in a different, more distant,
SO2 groups.

Rhodes and Frech48 have reported results
of Raman spectroscopy for a concentrated (1.86 M) LiTf solution in
diglyme, and they proposed that Li+ is coordinated by three
ether-O sites and one O from a triflate SO3 group, as a
part of a CIP. That structure could be reconciliated with the one
of type B shown in Figure 6 if we consider that at high salt concentrations, the counteranion
can get closer to the Li+ ion, displacing the second diglyme
molecule coordinated to the cation. On the other hand, Brouillette
et al.49 studied the Raman spectra of LiTFSI
in DME and diglyme in different concentrations and concluded that
in both solvents, SSIP are formed at low concentrations, which is
in agreement with the structure found in our MD simulations.

In summary, the MD simulations qualitatively reproduce the ionic
association trends and structure of the CIP observed experimentally.
Differences in KA, especially for the
case of LiTf in both solvents, are probably determined by a delicate
balance between ion/ion and ion/solvent couplings. Such KA differences, as discussed in Section 2.2, allow us to explain the order of conductivities
observed in finite-concentration solutions, provided the differences
in solvent viscosities are also considered.

2.4 Ionic
Diffusion of Lithium from Conductivity
Data and MD Simulations
To compare the ionic diffusion coefficients
obtained by MD simulations with the ionic limiting molar conductivities
reported in Table 1, we resorted to the Nernst–Einstein relationship50 5  which is valid at infinite dilution.
The infinite-dilution
diffusion coefficients, Di0, obtained from eq 3 are listed in Table 3.

Table 3 Ionic Diffusion Coefficients

and
Diglyme at 298.15 K

Li+	13.6	5.6	8.3	1.8	12.3	4.5	
Tf–	21.0	9.8	7.7	1.5	 	 	
TFSI–	19.2	9.0	6.3	1.9	 	 	
In all the cases, diffusion in DME is approximately
a factor 2
faster than the one observed in diglyme, which is somehow expected,
taking into account the difference in viscosities between DME and
diglyme (see Table S2 in the Supporting
Information) and the well-known η–1 dependence
of D derived from the Stokes–Einstein relationship.51

The MD simulation results for the ionic
diffusion
coefficients, DiMD, are listed in the fourth and fifth columns
of Table 3. One can
observe that the experimental trends for a particular tagged ion in
both solvents are reproduced by the simulation results, i.e., ionic
diffusion in DME is faster than that in diglyme. However, whereas
the agreements for the Li+ results are still acceptable,
simulation results for the diffusion of the anionic species fall too
low when compared to the ones obtained from the conductivity data.
Moreover, note that, invoking the above-mentioned Stokes–Einstein
relationship, one can even improve the accordance between the experimental
and the simulated results for Li+ by simply rescaling the
raw data of the simulations by the corresponding ratio between the
experimental and the simulated solvent viscosities, namely 6  The rescaled Li+ ionic diffusion
coefficients, DiMD*, obtained using the ratio
between the experimental viscosities of the solvents (see the Supporting Information) and the calculated ones
by using MD simulations52 are also displayed
in last two columns of Table 3. One can observe that now, the differences between the simulation
and the experimental results for the Li+ diffusion constants
are comparable, within a 20% discrepancy.

An alternative strategy
would be to rescale the ion charges, but
considering that the Li+ ion diffuses to maintain a practically
unchanged, tightly bound, spherical-like solvation shell, it is expected
that its infinite-dilution diffusion coefficient depends more on the
solvent–solvent interaction, that is, on the viscosity rather
than the ion charge scaling. Because the interactions of the bulky
anions with the solvent are weaker, making the solvation structure
not so persistent, the viscosity correction would be less reasonable
than in the case of Li+ ion, so it was not performed.

Rescaling the charges of anions will probably result in MD infinite-dilution
diffusion coefficients closer to the experimental values. Such parametrization
improvements to describe dynamical properties will surely deserve
further analysis, but they are beyond the scope of the present work.

Before closing this section, it is worth mentioning that the transport
coefficients reported in this work for Li+, Tf–, and TFSI– ions cannot be directly compared with
those determined by MD simulations45 for
LiTFSI in DME, or experimentally by pulse-gradient spin-echo 7Li and 19F NMR53 for
LiTFSI in DME and diglyme because the diffusion coefficients reported
in those works correspond to concentrated solutions (glyme/salt ratio
equal to 20). However, the experimental diffusion coefficients obtained
by NMR for Li+ and TFSI– exhibit the
same trend as our infinite-diffusion data, that is, DTFSI–/DME > DLi+/DME > DTFSI–/DG > DLi+/DG.

3 Conclusions
The electrical conductivities
of LiTf and LiTFSI in DME and diglyme
were measured at 298.15 K over a wide range of concentrations, including
the triple-ion-formation region, which determines the minimum in the
molar conductivity as a function of concentration.

The formation
constant of ion pairs (KA) was determined
using the Fuoss–Kraus and the FHFP treatment
by fixing the infinite-dilution molar conductivities of the corresponding
salts from the fractional Walden rule for the corresponding ions.
Both treatments yield consistent results, and the FK equation allowed
us to obtain reliable values for the formation constant of triplet
ions (KT). Following the idea that strong
association promote large Li2O2 discharge deposits
through a top-down mechanism,23 the system
LiTf/DME would be the best choice as the electrolyte for a LAB.

The speciation obtained for the LiTf/diglyme system was compared
with those reported in previous studies by implementing different
approaches, and it is concluded that the results obtained through
the conductivity analysis using the equations for highly associated
electrolytes yield a consistent association scheme. By comparing the
association constants and conductivities of the four systems studied,
we found that a lower conductivity in concentrated solutions is not
an absolute criteria for a stronger association because the solvent
viscosity determines the conductivity in the concentrated region,
whereas dielectric constant and specific ion–solvent interactions
determine the association degree.

Our measurements in DME and
diglyme solvents expand the data for
LiTf and LiTFSI in solvents of low dielectric constant (ε <
10). The trend is consistent with an increase in KA with increasing 1/ε, but important differences
are observed for the association constants of LiTf and, to a lesser
extent, for LiTFSI in DME and diglyme. The MD simulations allowed
us to rationalize these differences in terms of the competing interactions
of the O-sites of the ethers and the SOx groups of the corresponding anions with Li+ ion.

The limiting Li+ diffusivity derived from the fractional
Walden rule agrees quite well with those obtained from MD simulations,
provided the difference between the experimental solvent viscosity
and the calculated one using MD is accounted for. This is not the
case for the anions diffusivities probably as a consequence of deficiencies
in the treatment of cross solute–solvent interactions adopted
in this work.

4 Experimental and Computational
Procedures
4.1 Materials
Anhydrous bis(2-methoxy-ethyl)ether
(diglyme or DG, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5% pure) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(DME, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5% pure) were used as received. Lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate
((Li triflate, or LiTf), Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)
(LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%) were dried by heating at 140 °C
under vacuum for more than 12 h. All the chemicals were stored in
an argon-filled MBRAUN glovebox with oxygen content lower than 0.1
ppm and water content below 2 ppm. All the solutions were prepared
inside the glovebox and the water content was measured using the Karl
Fisher coulometric titration (831 KFCoulometer, Metrohm). The water
content of all the solutions studied in this work was less than 50
ppm at the beginning and less than 75 ppm at the end of the conductivity
measurements.

4.2 Conductivity Measurements
Two air-tight
conductivity cells with platinized platinum electrodes were used to
determine the conductivities of LiTf and LiTFSI in DME and diglyme.
The cell used for the diluted and moderate concentrations (10–5 to 0.1 M) had a mixing bulb with a magnetic stirrer
and a septum to inject an aliquot of stock solution under dry conditions.
A capillary cell, with a much larger constant, was used for highly
concentrated solutions (0.5–2 M). Both cells were calibrated
using standard KCl aqueous solutions of known specific conductivity54 with different concentrations (between 0.01
and 1 m) to cover the different ranges of concentrations
for each cell. The measured cell constants were kcell1 = 0.1157 ± 0.0002 cm–1 for
the conventional cell and kcell2 = 136.9
± 0.2 cm–1 for the capillary cell.

For
the dilute and moderate range of concentrations, the measurements
were performed according to the following protocol. A concentrated
stock solution of the salt in the corresponding solvent was prepared
inside a glovebox and kept in an air-tight vessel provided with a
septum. The conductivity cell was filled with a weighed amount of
pure solvent inside the glovebox and then transferred to an oil bath
thermostatized at 298.15 ± 0.05 K. After reaching thermal equilibrium,
the electrical resistance of the pure solvent, Rsv, was measured. Then, increasing amounts of stock solution
were added to the cell using a syringe. The solution was homogenized
by magnetic stirring and the solution’s electrical resistance, Rsc, was determined.

For the concentrated
region, each individual solution was prepared
using a volumetric flask. The capillary cell was filled with the solution
inside the glovebox and then transferred to the thermostatized oil
bath, where the solution’s electrical resistance was determined.

For resistance measurements, a LCR meter (GwINSTEK) was used. An
alternating current voltage (100 mV) was applied to the electrodes
at different frequencies and the resistive and capacitive components
were recorded, considering an equivalent resistance–capacitance
parallel circuit. The resistance component was recorded at five frequencies
between 0.5 and 5 kHz and the extrapolated value at infinite frequency
was taken as the true value used in the calculations.

The specific
conductivity, κ, and the molar conductivity,
Λ, of the electrolyte were determined according to 7  where c is the electrolyte
molar concentration, Rsc is the solution
resistance and Rsv is the solvent resistance.
The solvent resistance correction is small in the concentrated region,
but becomes important in the very dilute region, being the main source
of error.

4.3 Molecular Dynamic Simulations
We
performed MD simulations on systems composed of Ns solvent molecules (DME and DG) and isolated ion pairs,
confined within fully periodic, cubic boxes. Concerning the ion pairs,
we considered those combining Li+ as cation and Tf– or TFSI– as anions. In all the cases,
the total number of solvent molecules were set to Ns = 500; the linear dimensions of the simulation boxes
were adjusted at values close to 4.5–5.0 nm, so as to bring
the global densities in agreement with the corresponding experimental
values: ρDME = 0.869 g cm–3 and
ρDG = 0.937 g cm–3 at 298.15 K.

All the molecules were modeled as fully flexible collections of
atoms. For ethers, we implemented the parametrization reported by
Barbosa et al.52 For ionic species, we
adopted the parameters already reported.55,56 The potential energy of the system was considered as a sum of pair-decomposable
site–site terms. The intramolecular interactions comprised
of standard stretching, bending, and dihedral contributions, whereas
intermolecular interactions combined dispersion (Lennard-Jones) and
Coulomb terms. To evaluate cross-interactions, we implemented the
usual arithmetic and geometrical means for the length and energy parameters
describing the dispersive Lennard-Jones interactions. Forces derived
from the latter contributions were computed using a cutoff distance
set at 1.3 nm, whereas the Ewald sum methods were applied to treat
the long-range nature of Coulomb interactions.

Appropriate sampling
of equilibrium properties was collected along
canonical runs with the thermostats set at T = 298.15
K, lasting typically 10 ns; dynamical properties were computed as
averages obtained from five statistically independent microcanonical
runs, each one lasting 5 ns. All simulations were performed using
the NAMD package.57

The potential
of mean forces was computed using the ABF procedure.58−60 The scheme relies on the generation of trajectories along a chosen
reaction coordinate, ξ, experiencing practically no free energy
barriers. This is achieved by means of biasing forces estimated along
a series of small bins, which, in turn, span the complete ξ
interval. These forces are applied to flatten the free energy surface,
so that ξ becomes uniformly sampled. In this case, ξ was
taken as the distance between Li+ and the S(N) site in the anion.

The spatial correlations between Li+ and the solvent
were analyzed by computing the pair correlation functions gLi,X between the cation and a tagged solvent
site X, namely 8  where rLi+ and riX correspond to
the positions
of the cation and the X-site (X = O, methylene C, and methyl C) in
the ether chains, respectively; ρX represents the
corresponding bulk density of X-sites and ⟨...⟩ denotes
an equilibrium ensemble average.

Diffusion coefficients were
computed from the long-time, limiting
behavior of the corresponding mean square displacements, namely 9  where rα(t) represents the position of the α particle
at time t.
