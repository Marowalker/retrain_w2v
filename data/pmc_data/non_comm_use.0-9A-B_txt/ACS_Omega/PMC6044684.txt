The
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a validated therapeutic
target for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In the present study,
we synthesize novel adamantanyl-based thiadiazolyl pyrazoles by introducing
the adamantane ring to thiazolopyrazoline. On the basis of loss of
cell viability
in TNBC cells, 4-(adamantan-1-yl)-2-(3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazole (APP) was identified as a lead compound.
Using a Parzen–Rosenblatt Window classifier, APP was predicted
to target the EGFR protein, and the same was confirmed by surface
plasmon resonance. Further analysis revealed that APP suppressed the
phosphorylation of EGFR at Y992, Y1045, Y1068, Y1086, Y1148, and Y1173
in TNBC cells. APP also inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK at Y204
and of STAT3 at Y705, implying that APP downregulates the activity
of EGFR downstream effectors. Small interfering RNA mediated depletion
of EGFR expression prevented the effect of APP in BT549 and MDA-MB-231
cells, indicating that APP specifically targets the EGFR. Furthermore,
APP modulated the expression of the proteins involved in cell proliferation
and survival. In addition, APP altered the expression of epithelial–mesenchymal
transition related proteins and suppressed the invasion of TNBC cells.
Hence, we report a novel and specific inhibitor of the EGFR signaling
cascade.

==== Body
Introduction
Triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of
breast cancer distinguished by the lack of human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2-negative, also known as HER2/neu and ErbB2),
estrogen receptor (ER-negative), and progesterone receptor (PR-negative);
hence, this subtype is not responsive to effective targeted therapeutics
used in breast cancer.1,2 Approximately 15% of diagnosed
breast cancer is triple negative and is associated with a poor prognosis.3 Therefore, the identification and validation
of potential therapeutic targets involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation, survival, metastasis, and chemoresistance in TNBC have
attracted significant attention in cancer drug discovery.4 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
an earlier proposed target for cancer treatment, its expression is
increased in TNBC,
and is significantly associated with a negative prognosis in TNBC.5 Several targeted therapeutics have entered clinical
trials, but unfortunately, none of them have yet been approved for
TNBC.6 Therefore, treatment of TNBC remains
an unmet need. Studies have revealed that targeting the EGFR improved
the sensitivity of TNBC to cytotoxic agents by promoting apoptosis
in TNBC cells, and several EGFR inhibitors have been approved for
the treatment of other cancers.7

The binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of EGFR leads
to the activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in the
phosphorylation of a series of tyrosine residues (Y992, Y1068, Y1086,
Y1148, and Y1173) in the carboxy-terminal domain.8 The autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues provides docking
sites for cytoplasmic proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and
phosphotyrosine-binding domains.9 The interaction
of cytoplasmic proteins with the specific phosphotyrosine residues
of the EGFR results in the initiation of the intracellular signaling
cascade via several pathways.10 Lapatinib
is a quinazoline-based small-molecule inhibitor of the EGFR, which
has been approved for the treatment of metastatic TNBC.11 Gefitinib, erlotinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab
are also the approved drugs targeting the EGFR for the treatment of
various types of cancers.12 Therefore,
EGFR inhibitors may provide substantial clinical benefit for patients
with TNBC.7 Thus, the development of novel
EGFR inhibitors may provide a promising therapeutic approach for TNBC.

Thiazole, pyrazole, and adamantane derivatives have been studied
for their antitumor activity by several research groups and reported
to possess significant in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity against
a broad range of cancers.13−16 Dasatinib (BMS-354825; Bristol-Myers Squibb) is a
thiazole derivative that inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells
by targeting the EGFR signaling pathway.17 Furthermore, it has been reported that pyrazole derivatives inhibit
the EGFR kinase activity in breast cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations.18 In addition, conjugated thiazolyl–pyrazoline
derivatives were demonstrated to possess potent EGFR kinase inhibitory
activities.19 Lamoureux and colleagues
have summarized the importance of the adamantane group in modulating
the ADME profile of known drugs and identified adamantanes as an important
pharmacophore for the design of new drugs.20 In the present article, we generated a new structure, 4-(adamantan-1-yl)-substituted-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazole (APT), by introducing the adamantane
ring to the thiazolopyrazoline scaffold and demonstrated the effect
of the lead compound on EGFR signaling.

Results
Chemistry
The synthetic route employed in the synthesis
of the thiazolyl–pyrazoline derivatives is represented in Figure 1a. Initially, chalcones 1a–l were prepared by condensation of
equimolar amounts of substituted aldehydes and ketones under base-catalyzed
conditions. The obtained chalcones, 1a–l, were refluxed with equimolar amount of thiosemicarbazide in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate [BMIM][BF4] using catalytic amount of
piperidine to generate dihydropyrazole intermediate 2a–l. Thereafter, 2-(adamantan-1-yl)acetylbromide
was added to dihydropyrazole intermediate 2a–l in situ to generate the title compounds, 3a–l (Figure 1A). All of the new compounds exhibited spectral properties
consistent with the assigned structures and were fully characterized
by their spectroscopic data (1H, IR, mass, elemental, and 13C NMR analyses). Spectra for the new compounds are provided
as Supporting Information.

APTs Exhibit Growth Inhibitory Effect on TNBC Cells
We initially examined the growth inhibitory effects of APTs against
the panel of eight breast cancer cell lines, including MCF7, T47D,
BT474, BT549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, HCC70, and BT20, using the AlamarBlue
assay, and the IC50 values are given in Table 1. Among the tested
compounds, 4-(adamantan-1-yl)-2-(3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)thiazole (APP; Figure 1B) was observed to be the most effective
among the structural variants in decreasing the viability of the tested
cell lines (Table S2). Notably, APP reported
the highest growth inhibitory effect against BT549 (TNBC) with an
IC50 of 4.9 μM compared to that against other
TNBCs (Table S2).

APP Exposure to BT549 Cells
Decreases Cell Proliferation
Therefore, next we determined
the effect of APP on cell proliferation
of BT549 cells. APP exposure resulted in a reduction of BT549 total
cell count in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A). Increased cell number results from the
net effect of increased cell proliferation and/or a decrease in apoptotic
cell death.21,22 The fragmentation of internucleosomal
DNA is one of the prominent characteristic features of cell apoptosis
and the frequency
if cells with DNA content can be detected using flow cytometric analysis.23,24 To evaluate the effect of APP on the cell cycle of BT549 cells,
we analyzed the cell cycle distribution pattern of BT549 cells following
treatment with APP using flow cytometry. BT549 cells were treated
with APP at different doses up to 5 μM for 24 h. We observed
the gradual accumulation of cells in the subG1 phase to 7.5, 17.2,
and 50.3% after treatment with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM APP, respectively
(Figure 2B). Moreover,
BT549 cells treated with different concentrations of APP for 24 h
were stained with Hoechst 33342 dyes and examined for condensed chromatin,
which is a feature of apoptosis in cancer cells. Only BT549 cells
treated with 2.5 and 5 μM of APP resulted in a significant increase
in the percentage of condensed chromatin as compared to the control
(Figure 2C), suggesting
that APP possibly induces apoptosis in BT549. Thus, APP exposure to
BT549 suppresses cell proliferation.

Figure 2 Exposure of APP to BT549 cells decreases
cell proliferation and
stimulate apoptotic cell death. (A) Total cell count of BT549 cells
cultured in complete media for 6 days after exposure to different
concentrations of APP and vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)).
The morphology of BT549 cells after exposure to APP and vehicle control
is represented on the right side. Images were captured
under 100× magnification. (B) BT549 cells were treated with different
concentrations of APP (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h, and
cell cycle distribution was analyzed by staining with propidium iodide
(PI) using flow cytometry. The analysis revealed that APP accumulates
BT549 cells in the SubG1 phase, indicating that cells are committed
to apoptosis. (C) BT549 cells were treated with different concentrations
of APP (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 μM) for 24 h, and apoptotic cell
distribution was analyzed by Hoechst 33258 staining using confocal
microscopy. Images of BT549 cells after exposure to APP and vehicle
control are represented on the right side. Images
were captured under 100× magnification. All assays were performed
as described
in Methods. Column points are mean of triplicate
experiments; bars, ±standard deviation (SD). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.

Computational Mode-of-Action
Analysis for APTs
In an
attempt to rationalize the observed inhibitory effect of the APTs
on TNBC cells, we predicted potential human protein targets using
ligand-based cheminformatic approaches. The first method used was
the Parzen–Rosenblatt Window classifier trained on bioactivity
data extracted from ChEMBL, as previously deployed by Koutsoukas et
al., where the probability cutoff was set to be 0.05.25 Targets predicted for the APTs with a probability above
the cutoff specified are depicted in Table S2. The second method employed a Bernoulli Naïve Bayes classifier
trained on active bioactivity data obtained from ChEMBL26 and negative bioactivity data extracted from
PubChem.27 Predictions from this tool ranked
the EGFR highly, in the top 10% of predicted targets across the average
of all of the APTs. These results indicate that the potential in silico
mode of action of the APTs was to the EGFR.

In Silico Molecular Interactions of APP with EGFR
The
in silico analysis revealed that all APTs target the EGFR, which was
consistently predicted across algorithms with a higher rank of the
probability factor of greater than 0.60. Therefore, we decided to
identify potential protein–ligand interactions using a molecular
docking approach. We used the crystal structure of the EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain in complex with a similar hydrophobic inhibitor (PDB: 3W33) as the basis for
our studies.28 In silico docking predicted
a common binding mode for the series of APTs that shows a major overlap
with the binding present
in the crystal structure (Figure 3A). Intramolecular hydrophobic interactions assist
the conformation of APP to occupy the binding groove of the EGFR kinase
domain. Thereby, prominent hydrophobic interactions with Leu-718 and
Val-726 of the EGFR are predicted. Additionally, a hydrogen bond with
Lys-745 is formed. The chlorine substituents of APP showing the highest
biological activity optimize the shape fit of the compounds, thus
providing a basic molecular explanation for the observed structure–activity
relationships. In correlation with this,
the hydrophobic naphthalene that is fused to the pyrazole, a reference
compound, was predicted to dock into the kinase domain of EGFR, which
showed that the naphthalene ring formed π–π bonds
with Lys-721, which may lead to enhanced antitumor activity.29

the interaction of APP
with the EGFR protein. (A) Predicted molecular interactions between

The predicted binding mode of APP shows a major shape overlap with

as thin sticks and include Leu-718, Val-726, and Lys-745, which form
hydrogen bonds to the ligand (yellow dots). (B) The sensorgrams obtained
by SPR analysis of APP with the EGFR protein subunit. The EGFR protein
subunit was immobilized onto the surface of a CM5 sensor chip. A solution
of APP at variable concentrations was injected to generate the results
of
binding responses (RU) recorded as a function of time (s). The results
were analyzed using BIA evaluation 3.1. (C) Western blot analysis
was performed to evaluate the effect of APP on EGFR phosphorylation
(at Y992, Y1068, Y1086, Y1148, and Y1173) in BT549 cells. Soluble
whole cell extracts were run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotted as described in Methods. β-Actin was used as input control
for cell lysate. The sizes of the detected protein bands in kilodaltons
are shown on the left side.

SPR Analysis of APP with EGFR
Next, we examined the
potential interaction between APP and EGFR by SPR analysis using the
BIACORE system as described previously.30 The amino terminal of the EGFR was immobilized on the surface of
a CM5 sensor chip, and rest of the EGFR molecule including the kinase
domain was allowed to interact with APP. Four different concentrations
of APP (10, 20, 30, and 40 μM) were passed as analytes. The
sensogram curves revealed the dose-dependent increase in the interaction
of immobilized protein with APP (Figure 3B). The association and dissociation curves
were used to calculate the kinetic parameters for the interaction
of APP with EGFR, which revealed the association rate constant of
(6.59 ± 0.10) × 104 M–1 s–1 and dissociation rate constant of (77.76 ± 4.09)
× 10–2 s–1 of binding affinity,
which yielded dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) of 11.8 ± 2.40 μM. These data indicate that
APP exhibited molecular interaction with the EGFR protein.

APP
Inhibits Tyrosine Phosphorylation of EGFR in BT549 Cells
Phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues present in the C-terminal
domain of the EGFR contributes to activation of downstream signaling
pathways via SH2 domain interaction.31,32 Therefore,
inhibition of phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues abrogates
multiple growth-promoting pathways.33 To
determine if APP indeed targets the EGFR as predicted by the in silico
computational analysis, we analyzed the effect of APP on the phosphorylation
of key tyrosine residues of the EGFR using western blot analysis.
As shown in Figure 3C, phosphorylation of tyrosine at 1045, 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173
was observed to be decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum
inhibition at 5 μM and without change in the expression of the
EGFR.

APP Induces Apoptosis in BT549 Cells in Three-Dimensional (3D)
Culture and Decreases the Expression of EGFR Downstream Effectors
Cancer cells often offer more resistance to cytotoxic agents in
3D multicellular conformation compared to that in monolayer culture.34,35 Therefore, we investigated the effect of APP on the growth of BT549
cells in 3D Matrigel. BT549 cells were cultured and treated with APP
at the indicated doses for 24 h to measure the cellular viability
and caspase activity using the ApoTox-Glo assay. APP exposure to BT549
cells decreased cell viability and concomitantly increased caspase
3/7 activity in a dose-dependent manner compared to those
in vehicle-treated cells in 3D culture (Figure 4A,B).

Figure 4 Exposure of APP to BT549 cells stimulates
apoptosis in 3D matrigel
culture and decreases expression of the downstream molecular effectors
of EGFR signaling. (A) Cell viability and (B) caspase 3/7 activities
were evaluated using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex assay kit (Promega) as
described in Methods. Cell viability fluorescence
is measured at 400Ex/505Em, and apoptosis (caspase
3/7 activities) is determined by luminescence measurement. The morphology
of BT549-cells-generated colonies after exposure to APP and vehicle
control is represented below. Images were captured
under 100× magnification using a bright field microscope (Nikon,
Japan). (C) Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the effect
of APP on the downstream molecular effectors of EGFR signaling in
BT549 cells. Soluble whole cell extracts were run on SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted as described in Methods. β-Actin
was used as input control for cell lysate. The sizes of the detected
protein bands in kilodaltons are shown on the left side. All assays were performed as described in Methods. Column points are mean of triplicate experiments; bars, ±SD.
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and
***p < 0.001.

As phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the EGFR
is
required for the activation of the SH2 domain containing downstream
signaling proteins, we analyzed the effect of APP on pivotal downstream
effectors by western blot analysis. It was observed that increasing
doses of APP decreased the activation of p44/42 MAP kinase (phosphorylation
at Y204) and STAT3 (phosphorylation at Y705), which indicates that
APP decreases the activity of EGFR downstream effectors (Figure 4C). However, the
treatment of cells with APP exhibited no effect on the expression
of total ERK or STAT3 protein.

APP Modulates the Expression
of Cell Cycle Regulators and Apoptotic
Proteins in BT549 Cells
Next, we evaluated the effect of
APP on the expression of pro-survival and cell cycle regulatory proteins
in BT549 cells using western blotting. APP significantly decreased
the expression of cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1, cyclin
B1, and c-Myc in a concentration-dependent manner. However, treatment
with APP did not alter the expression of CDK4, a protein which facilitates
the G1/S transition in association with cyclin D1.36 In addition, phosphorylation of CDK2 at T160 and the formation
of the CDK2/cyclin A complex is required for G2/M cell cycle progression.
Our results demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of CDK2 at T160,
indicative of reduced activity of CDK2 (Figure 4C).

The activation of the EGFR has
also been reported to modulate apoptosis.37 Therefore, we further analyzed whether APP modulated the expression
of proapoptotic or antiapoptotic protein. We observed decreased expressions
of BCL2 and BCL-xL (Figure 4C). Additionally, we also observed the increased expression
of the proapoptotic BAD protein, cytochrome c, and
cleaved caspase 3 in a dose-dependent manner with maximum activity
at 5 μM (Figure 4C), suggesting that APP relays apoptotic signals in TNBC cells at
multiple levels to render its effect.

APP Decreases TNBC Cell
Invasion and Migration
EGFR
signaling promotes cancer cell migration and invasion by promoting
an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like phenotype change
accompanied by MMP-9-mediated degradation of E-cadherin.33,38−40 Therefore, we evaluated whether APP modulates the
motility of TNBC cells. Figure 5A demonstrated that APP significantly suppressed the migration
of BT549 cells at 5 μM. Furthermore, we investigated the effect
of APP on cellular invasion using transwell invasion chambers. APP
restricted cell invasion through the membrane by nearly 50% at 5 μM,
demonstrative of the anti-invasive potential of APP (Figure 5B).

Figure 5 APP suppresses the migration
and invasion and modulates the expression
of EMT-related proteins in BT549 cells. (A) Migration assay: BT549
cells were plated on a 6 cm culture dish. After 24 h incubation, the
medium was removed and a scratch was done using P200 pipette tip.
The cells were then rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
before APP treatment. The migration of cells was monitored at 0–24
h using bright field microscopy. (B) Transwell invasion assay: BT549
cells were suspended in a serum-free Dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium (DMEM) and seeded in the top chamber of a 5% Matrigel in a
24-well Transwell insert (Greiner bio-one ThinCert 24-well culture
insert; 8.0 μM). Thereafter, APP and DMSO in serum-free media
were added followed by DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
After 24 h incubation, Transwell inserts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min at 4 °C and stained with Hoechst dye. Cell nuclei
were counted and plotted in percentage. (C) Western blot analysis
was performed to evaluate the effect of APP on the expression of EMT-related
proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and occludin) in BT549 cells. Soluble
whole cell extracts were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described
in Methods. β-Actin was used as input
control for cell lysate. The sizes of the detected protein bands in
kilodaltons are shown on the left side. All assays
were performed as described in Methods. Column
points are mean of triplicate experiments; bars, ±SD. * p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.

APP Modulates the Expression of EMT-Related Proteins
Increased expression of N-cadherin has been implicated in metastasis
and loss of occludin and E-cadherin is correlated with cell invasion
and a negative prognosis in various human cancers.41−43 Therefore,
we investigated whether APP modulated the expression of proteins characteristic
of EMT such as N-cadherin, occludin, and E-cadherin. The treatment
of BT549 cells with APP decreased the expression of N-cadherin and
increased the expressions of occludin and E-cadherin in a dose-dependent
manner up to 5 μM (Figure 5C).

siRNA-Mediated Depletion
of EGFR Expression
Prevented the Effect of APP in Breast Cancer Cell Lines
Next,
we evaluated the functional specificity of APP toward EGFR by siRNA-mediated depletion of EGFR transcripts in BT549 and
MDA-MB-231 cells. Transient transfection of EGFR-directed siRNA in both cell lines resulted in decreased levels of
the phospho-EGFR (Y1045, Y1068, and Y1086) and total EGFR when compared
with those of the respective scrambled siRNA control
(Figure 6A). The treatment
of the scrambled-siRNA-transfected cells with APP
significantly suppressed the phosphorylation (Y1045, Y1068, Y1086)
of the EGFR compared to that of
DMSO-treated cells. In parallel, the treatment of cells
with APP significantly increased apoptosis compared to DMSO-treated
cells. However, APP did not affect the cell viability in either cell
line with depleted expression of the EGFR (Figure 6B,C).

Figure 6 siRNA-mediated depletion
of EGFR expression prevents
the effect of APP in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Western blot
analysis was performed to analyze the levels of phospho-EGFR (Y1045,
Y1068, Y1086) and total EGFR protein in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells
after siRNA-mediated depletion of EGFR transcripts
and/or exposure to APP. Depletion of EGFR expression was achieved
using transient transfection of si-RNA directed to EGFR transcripts.
Soluble whole cell extracts were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted
as described in Methods. β-Actin was
used as input control for cell lysate. The sizes of the detected protein
bands in kilodaltons are shown on the left side.
(B) Cell viability and (C) caspase 3/7 activities were evaluated in
BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells after siRNA-mediated depletion
of EGFR transcripts and/or exposure to APP using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex
assay kit as described in Methods. Cell viability
fluorescence was measured at 400Ex/505Em and
cytotoxicity fluorescence was measured at 485Ex/520Em, whereas apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activities) was determined

Discussion
Therapeutic targeting in TNBC
is a clinical challenge because of the lack of HER2, ER, and PR, for
which effective therapeutics are available. However, TNBC exhibits
increased expression of the EGFR in approximately half of the cases
and is considered as one of the chief contributors to the negative
prognosis of TNBC.5 Hence, there has been
a significant focus to design EGFR inhibitors for use in EGFR-positive
TNBC.7 Previous findings suggest that EGFR
signaling regulates tumor cell migration in adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas
and that treatment with gefitinib reduces tumor cell motility.38 EGFR signaling has been demonstrated to promote
EMT, which is considered as a critical process in regulating cell
motility.44 During EMT, a variety of epithelial
cells change their morphology from a polarized epithelial phenotype
(loss of epithelial markers such as E-cadherins and cytokeratins)
to a mesenchymal fibroblastoid phenotype (expression of vimentin and
fibronectin) and favor cell migration and invasion, which demonstrates
the multifaceted role of the EGFR in pathogenesis.7

The key role of the EGFR in negative prognosis in
various malignancies
resulted in the development of numerous anti-EGFR agents, and several
of them have been advanced to the clinic.12 Moreover, several synthetic small molecules and monoclonal antibodies
targeting the EGFR family tyrosine kinases in breast cancer are in
different phases of trials.45 Cetuximab
is an immunoglobulin G1 chimeric mouse–human monoclonal antibody,
which targets the extracellular domain of the EGFR and has been approved
for combinational therapy with irinotecan in the treatment of EGFR-expressing
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) refractory patients.46 Similarly, Panitumumab, a humanized immunoglobulin
G2 monoclonal antibody, acts by blocking the interaction between the
EGF and EGFR and has been approved for the treatment of EGFR-expressing
metastatic CRC patients.47 Moreover, several
heterocyclic small molecules have been approved for the treatment
of various cancers including breast cancer. Recently, in 2015, gefitinib,
a quinazolin-4-amine derivative and an inhibitor of the EGFR, was
approved for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsmall-cell
lung cancer.47 Also, gefitinib is in phase-II
of clinical trials against triple-negative, EGFR-positive metastatic
breast cancer.48 In another phase-II study,
a combination of erlotinib with carboplatin and docetaxel showed promising
results in the treatment of TNBC patients with a pathological complete
response of 40%.49,50 Notably, several studies have
shown the insensitivity of EGFR-expressing tumors to anti-EGFR agents,
indicating the EGFR-independent tumor survival and the demand of combinational
therapy targeting alternative signaling pathways along with anti-EGFR
agents.7,51 Therefore, in the present study, we report
the synthesis of chemically novel, biologically active EGFR inhibitors
for use in TNBCs.
The experimental data of our studies present the growth inhibitory
effects of the lead structure against a panel of TNBC cells. Utilizing
the platform of the in silico target prediction tool, APP appears
to have potential inhibitory effects against the EGFR. Consistent
with the in silico computational analysis, APP inhibited the phosphorylation
of the key tyrosine residues of EFGR and the activity of downstream
effectors including ERK and STAT3. In addition, APP was found to induce
apoptosis and suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion in TNBCs.
Concordantly, APP modulated the expression of various proteins involved
in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and EMT. Taken together, APP
is presented as a potential novel agent against TNBC; however, additional
mechanistic and preclinical studies are required to completely validate
its potential.

Methods
Chemistry
1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded using a Bruker WH-200 (400 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as a solvent. Chemical
shifts are expressed as parts per million, and TMS was used as an
internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a
Bruker Daltonics instrument. The Elemental Vario Cube CHNS rapid Analyzer
was used to carry out elemental analyses. The reaction progression
was monitored using thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-precoated silica
gel G plates, and the formation of products was visualized by irradiation
with UV light (254 nm). All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of APT
To a suspension
of chalcone (1 equiv) in [BMIM][BF4] (5 vol), thiosemicarbazide
(1.2 equiv) and piperidine (2–3 drops) were added. The reaction
mixture was heated to 80 °C for 4 h, and the completion of reaction
was monitored by TLC. Upon completion, the mixture was cooled and
charged with 2-(adamantan-1-yl)acetylbromide (1 equiv) into the reaction
flask. The reaction mixture was further heated for 2 h at 80 °C
and allowed to cool down. Thereafter, the mixture was filtered under
vacuum, crystallized using appropriate solvent, and dried. All of
the newly prepared compounds displayed consistent spectral properties
with the assigned structures. All of the compounds were characterized
by their spectroscopic (1H, IR, mass, elemental, and 13C NMR) analyses.

Pharmacology
Cell Culture and Reagents
Human MC
cell lines MCF7, BT474, T47D, MDA-MB-231, BT549, MDA-MB-468, HCC70,
and BT20 were obtained from the ATCC and were cultured as per ATCC
propagation instructions. Estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) MC cells,
including MCF7, T47D, and BT474, were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI 1640) culture medium supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin
(1%) and FBS (10%). DMEM supplemented with FBS (10%) and penicillin–streptomycin
(1%) was used to culture ER-negative (ER−) MC cells including
MDA-MB-231, BT549, MDA-MB-468, HCC70, and BT20. Cells were propagated
in a tissue culture flask and cultured at 37 °C with CO2 (5%) in humidified incubators. Culture mediums were replaced every
alternate day. EGFR-sequence-directed ON-TARGETplus EGFR siRNA (L-003114-00-0005) was purchased from Dharmacon.
Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligo (20 mM) or universal negative control oligo (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) using FuGENE HD (Promega) for 24 h and further assays
were performed.52 Hoechst 33258 reagent
was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific, and Hoechst staining was
performed as described previously.53

Oncogenicity Assays
The biological assay, an AlamarBlue
viability assay, was performed as described previously.52 Whole cell viability, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity
were evaluated using the ApoTox-Glo Triplex assay kit, Promega (Singapore),
according to manufacture’s instructions.34 In brief, 2 × 104 cells were seeded in
black opaque 96-well plates (Corning, Singapore) and incubated overnight
at 37 °C. Thereafter, 5 μM of APP and vehicle control (DMSO)
were added to the respective wells. After 24 h of incubation at 37
°C, the viability/cytotoxicity reagent containing both the GF-AFC
and bis-AAF-R110 substrates was added to the cells as indicated by
the manufacturer. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, fluorescence
was recorded at 400 nm excitation/505 nm emission for viability and
at 485 nm excitation/520 nm emission for cytotoxicity using a Tecan
microplate reader (Tecan, Singapore). Furthermore, the Caspase-Glo
3/7 reagent was added to the cells, the cells
were incubated for 25 min at room temperature, and luminescence was
recorded using Tecan microplate reader. Numbers of apoptotic, cytotoxic,
and viable cells were measured in triplicates.

Flow Cytometry
Analysis
The flow cytometric analysis
was performed to study the effect of APP on the cell cycle of BT549
cells as described previously.54−56 Initially, cells were treated
with APP at the indicated concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM
for 24 h. After the incubation, the cells were harvested, washed,
and fixed with 70% ethanol, followed by incubation with 0.1% RNase
A in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were subjected
to washing, re-suspension, and staining in PBS containing PI (25 μg/mL)
for 30 min at room temperature. The distribution of cells across the
cell cycle was analyzed with a Beckman Coulter flow cytometer.

3D Matrigel
Culture Assay
The 3D matrigel culture assay
was performed as reported previously.21,34 In brief,
BD BioCoat Matrigel was coated on 48-well plates and 2% matrigel containing
5 × 104 cells was cast above the 100% matrigel layer
and allowed to solidify. Thereafter, the cells were allowed to grow
before subjecting them to treatment with different concentrations
of APP (1.25, 2.5, and 5 μM)
in wild-type media containing 2% FBS.

Hoechst Staining
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates
at 200 000 cells/well and allowed to settle overnight before
treatment.57 After 24 h of treatment, the
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for
15 min. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Hoechst
33342 for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Finally, the stain
was removed with PBS and the nuclei of cells were imaged by fluorescence
microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells was assessed by counting
the number of cells that displayed condensed and/or fragmented nuclei
in three randomly selected fields at 20× magnification.

SPR
Analysis
Real-time analysis of the interactions
of APP with the EGFR was carried out on a Biacore 2000 instrument.
SPR binding studies for this inhibitor and protein were performed.
Initially, using a standard amine-coupling protocol of BIACORE, EGFR
proteins were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip in sodium acetate (10
mM, pH 5.0) and its immobilization pattern was noted. Furthermore,
SPR studies were performed at 25 °C in HBS-EP running buffer
containing 1% DMSO. Injections were made using the quick inject mode
at 15 μL/min with a compound dissociation time of 2 min. Ligand
injections were referenced to a blank surface and by a buffer blank.
APP was allowed to interact with EGFR for 2 min and dissociate for
another 2 min. Using BIA evaluation software, the ligand and protein
binding and fitting to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding kinetic model
were performed. The kinetic parameters, such as dissociation equilibrium
constants (Kd) and association and dissociation
rate constants (ka and kd), were determined. The sensograms obtained were overlaid
using BIA evaluation software.

Immunoblot Analyses
Immunoblot analysis was performed
as previously described58−60 using mouse anti-β-Actin,
mouse anti-p-ERK, rabbit anti-ERK, mouse anti-p-EGFR (Y1045), mouse
anti-p-EGFR (Y1148), mouse anti-p-EGFR (Y1173), mouse anti-CCND1,
mouse anti-CDK4, mouse anti-CCNB1, rabbit anti-c-MYC, mouse anti-BCL2,
mouse anti-BCL-XL, mouse anti-BAD, rabbit anti-CYCS, mouse anti-p-ERK
(44/42), and rabbit anti-ERK antibodies were procured from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA. Mouse anti-CDH1, mouse anti-CDH2, rabbit anti-OCLN,
rabbit anti-pSTAT3, and mouse anti-STAT3 antibodies were obtained
from Abcam, Cambridge, MA. Rabbit anti-p-EGFR (Y992) and rabbit anti-p-CDK2
antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Cell extracts were resolved
on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted, with the appropriate and respective
antibodies. β-Actin was used as input control for cell lysate.
The sizes of the detected protein bands are shown in kilodaltons on
the left side.

Migration and Invasion
Assay
Cell migration and invasion
assays were carried out using BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers
(BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) as previously described.22,61−63
