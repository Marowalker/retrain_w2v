Synthesis,
crystal structure, and optical properties of two-dimensional
(2D) layered structurally slightly different inorganic–organic
(IO) hybrid semiconductors (R–C6H4C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (R
= CH3, Cl) are presented. They are naturally self-assembled
systems where two (RNH3)+ moieties are sandwiched
between two infinitely extended 2D layers of the [PbI6]4– octahedral network and treated as natural IO multiple
quantum wells. While the former compound crystallizes into an orthorhombic
system in the Cmc21 space group, the latter
crystallizes into a monoclinic system in the space group P21/c. As a thin film, they are well-oriented
along the (l00) direction. Both single crystals and
thin films show strong room-temperature Mott type exciton features
that are highly sensitive to the self-assembly and crystal packing.
Linear (one-photon) and nonlinear (two-photon) optical probing of
single crystals for exciton photoluminescence imaging and spectral
spatial mapping provide deep insight into the layered re-arrangement
and structural crumpling due to organic conformation. The strongly
confined excitons, within the lowest band gap of inorganic, show distinctly
different one- and two-photon excited photoluminescence peaks: free
excitons from perfectly aligned 2D self-assembly and energy down-shifted
excitons originated from the locally crumpled layered arrangement.
Their structural aspects are successfully presented with proper correlation
that emphasize various differences in physical and optical properties
associated between these novel IO hybrids.

1 Introduction
Inorganic–organic
(IO) naturally self-assembled hybrid systems
have been a fascinating subject of interest for many years because
of their strong room-temperature excitons with high oscillator strength,1−3 interesting structural features,4−11 magnetic properties,12 and promising
electrical aspects.13−17 The self-assembled systems from the class of (RNH3)2MX4 (R = organic) are special and considered as
natural multiple quantum well (MQW) structures where two (RNH3)+ moieties are sandwiched between two infinitely
extended layers of [MX6]4– octahedral.
These two-dimensional (2D) IO hybrids show strong Mott type excitons
within the MX6 network. As a result of dielectric contrast
and quantum confinement-related effects,18 the exciton binding energies are enhanced larger than 200 meV.19 The band gap tunability can be conveniently
achieved from ∼2 to ∼3.2 eV by changing divalent metal
halide (MX2) inorganic entities alone (where M = Pb2+, Mn2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, Eu2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and
X = F−, Cl−, Br−, I−).20−26 Such synergy between inorganic and organic has produced a great
promising effect that led to the demonstration of many applications,
namely, LEDs,27 FETs,28−30 solar cells,31−38 polariton lasers,39,56−59 optical switches,40,41 electro-optical modulators,42 and so
on.

While the 2D crystal packing from RMX3-type group
entities
is the most common, the organic moiety (R–NH3)+ conformation within the MX2 network may lead to
other dimensionalities depending on the type of the organic moiety,
size, shape, and amino group location.43−48 Recently, it is well explored that the structural influence of the
organic moiety in 2D IO hybrids (RNH3)2PbI4 (R = organic) directly influences the Pb–I–Pb
crumpling angles and eventually band gap changes which directly reflects
in the exciton energies.23,39−41 In this communication, we have studied the synthesis, crystal structure,
and strong room-temperature exciton features in the 2D IO hybrid semiconductors,
(CH3–C6H4–C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (MPEPI) and
(Cl–C6H4–C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (CEPI) (Table 1). For both, the crystallographic, thermal, and optical studies
are systematically performed and presented here. A critical comparison
of MPEPI and CEPI is reported in this paper, emphasizing significant
differences in the exciton features, resulted out of these similar
organic moieties conformation within the inorganic network. Here,
we focus on linear (one-photon induced, ℏω ≥ Eg) and nonlinear (two-photon-induced, 2ℏω
≥ Eg) optical excitations to study
various possible exciton energies that are possible in these 2D-aligned
single crystals.49 One-photon absorption
(1PA, ℏω ≥ Eg) due
to high absorption coefficients results into quite small penetration
depths (∼1/α0),50 therefore, conventional photoluminescence (1PA-PL) provides information
only from the near-surfaces and are influenced by many unwanted effects
such as background emission, photo-bleaching, ablation, laser heating
effects, and so forth.51 On the other hand,
two-photon absorption (2PA) is a well-known third-order nonlinear
effect which utilizes two infrared photons (2ℏω ≥ Eg) and undergoes an electronic transition from
the ground state to the excited state through an intermediate virtual
state within the band gap.52 Such below-band
gap nonlinear excitation is having a much larger penetration depth
and therefore can probe into many nonradiative (dark) and radiative
states, that may not be invoked through conventional excitation. Thus,
the comparative spectral and spatial imaging studies of 1PA-PL and
2PA-PL help us to analyze how even the slightest structural re-organization
shows a significant difference in the optical features.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Packing and Structural
and Thermal
Features
CEPI crystallizes into the monoclinic system in
the space group P21/c, whereas MPEPI crystallizes
into the orthorhombic system in Cmc21 space
group. The unit cell dimensions of MPEPI are a =
32.544 Å; b = 9.316 Å; c = 8.6028 Å and α = β = γ = 90°; on the
other hand, the cell dimensions of CEPI are a = 16.200
Å; b = 9.2695 Å; c = 8.6314
Å and β = 96.738°. For MPEPI, the Pb–I–Pb
bond angle is 147.27°; I–Pb–I bond angles are 84.17,
90.98, 95.86, and 88.2°; Pb–I bond lengths are in the
range of 3.159 and 3.336 Å; C–C bond lengths are in the
range of 1.350 and 1.536 Å; the C–N bond length is 1.529
Å. In case of CEPI, the Pb–I–Pb bond angle is 153.72°;
I–Pb–I bond angles are 93.83, 86.14, 85.48, and 94.52°;
Pb–I bond lengths are 3.285 and 3.232 Å; C–C bond
lengths are in the range of 1.360–1.511 Å; the C–Cl
bond length is 1.747 Å; and the C–N bond length is 1.507
Å. Both the structures consist of 2D alternate layers of PbI6 and organic ammonium. This alternate layer fashion contains
a double layer of protonated organic ammonium cations which are being
sandwiched between infinitely extending PbI6 sheets as
shown in Figure 1.
Layers are infinetely extended by corner-sharing distorted PbI6 octahedra with the neighboring four octahedra through double-bridging
iodine atoms. The complete crystallographic data of both MPEPI and
CEPI are given in the Supporting Information (Table S1).

Figure 1 (a,b) Crystal packing of MPEPI and CEPI showing layer
separation
and Pb–I–Pb bond angle, respectively. (Hydrogens are
omitted for clarity).

The separation between
the infinitely extended lead iodide sheets
is found to be 16.92 and 17.19 Å in MPEPI and CEPI, respectively.
This difference can be attributed to the difference in the π–π
and C–H−π interactions between the phenyl rings
having different chemical environments around them. In both the crystal
structures, the PbI6 octahedra are slightly tilted because
of in-plane Pb–I–Pb bond crumpling. This is observed
to be ∼153.7 and ∼147.27° in CEPI and MPEPI, respectively
(Figure 1). The difference
in Pb–I–Pb bond crumpling in the MPEPI is being compressed
more compared to the previous one due to difference in the steric
effects between the organic ammoniums of both. The double layer of
organic in between the lead iodide planes is oriented in different
fashions in CEPI and MPEPI. In CEPI-protonated ammonia of two layers
connects to opposite sides, and the organic is inclined at an angle
of ∼62.42° as in the case of another IO hybrid, DDPI (NH3(CH2)12NH3PbI4, Dodecyl ammonium lead iodide) where the inclination angle is ∼45°.3 Unlike CEPI, in MPEPI-protonated ammonium connects
to the same side and the net alignment of the double layer of the
organic ammonium is vertically oriented, but the organics of the upper
and bottom layers seem to be crossing each other, whereas in the case
of CEPI, they are parallel. A view of the double layer of organic
alone is presented in Figure S1. It shows
that both MPEPI and CEPI contain each single layer of organic with
organics oriented in two different directions (Figure S1a,b). The double-layer view is even more clearly
visible when it is seen along the c-axis (Figure S1c,d).

In both CEPI and MPEPI, the bonding between the
organic and inorganic
layers plays a crucial role in enhancing the mechanical and thermal
stability of these materials. The protonated amine of the organic
interacts with three iodines through N···H–I hydrogen bonding
interaction in right-angled and terminal halide bonding configurations
as shown in Figure 2. This sort of bonding helps in rigid confirmation of the sensitive
organic part of the IO hybrid system.

Figure 2 (a,b) Showing terminal halide and right-angled
triangle bonding
configuration in both MPEPI and CEPI, respectively.

It is interesting to compare with the previous studies25 of similar hybrids formed by organic moieties,
4-X–C6H4NH2, where X = Cl
or CH3O. When chloro-aniline is substituted as the organic
moiety, the organic–inorganic hybrid assembles as a 2D-layered
network [(Cl–C6H4NH3)2PbI4], whereas for methoxy–aniline, the
resultant network is composed of 1D PbI ribbons as [(CH3O–C6H4NH3)2Pb3I8·2H2O]. This signifies that the crystal
packing is critically dependent on the nature and the shape of the
guest moiety as well as the nature of the substituents.

The
thin-film glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) pattern
shows strong orientation in both MPEPI- and CEPI-layered sheets along
(2l00) and (00l) (l = 1,2,3..) directions, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. The corresponding d-spacing in MPEPI and CEPI are 16.25 and 16.89 Å,
respectively, which are the same as observed from the single crystal
diffraction analysis. As shown in Figure 3, the thin-film XRD is coinciding with the
observed powder XRD extracted from the crystallographic information.

Figure 3 (a,b)
are the thin film glancing angle XRD (GAXRD) of MPEPI and
CEPI (blue) and powder XRD (black) extracted from single crystal XRD
data with the orientation on the substrate along (0,0,l) and (2l,0,0) (l = 1,2,3...) planes,
respectively.

The thermogravimetry analysis
(TGA) and the derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG) curve of MPEPI (Figure 4a), the temperature up to which it is stable is observed to
be 231 °C, suggests that both are thermally stable up to 240
°C with organic decomposed with a weight loss of 49.95%. After
this, only PbI2 remains in the sample. In case of CEPI
(Figure 4b), it is
suggested that it is thermally stable up to 240.6 °C. Below this
temperature, the intermediate organic is stable and a weight loss
of 50.48% (which is 1.893 mg out of 3.75 mg) is observed with further
increase in temperature. This weight loss suggests complete decomposition
of organic, leaving PbI2 alone behind. The thermal stability
suggests that both these hybrids can be used for device operations
even up to 200 °C. Beyond this temperature, organic completely
decomposes with a weight loss of 52.66% (which is 2.94 mg out of 5.7487
mg), leaving PbI2 behind.

Figure 4 (a,b) shows the TGA (red) and DTG (blue)
curves of MPEPI and CEPI,
respectively.

2.2 Optical
Absorption and PL Features of IO Hybrid
Thin Films
These 2D IO hybrids are naturally self-assembled
into alternative stacks of the PbI6 infinitely extended
network, where organic moieties are conformed within the layer spacing
(Figure 1). Typically,
the inorganic layers are of ∼6 Å thickness and the organic
spacers are 16–18 Å, depending on the shape/size of the
organic moiety. This layered structure is considered to be natural
MQWs, wherein the band gap contrast values between the inorganic and
organic layers are ∼3 and ∼6 eV, forming “well”
and “barrier”, respectively. Figure 5a,b shows strong room-temperature absorption
and PL spectra of both the MPEPI and CEPI thin films, respectively.
The absorption spectrum of CEPI shows a broad peak at ∼381
nm and a strong absorption peak at ∼498 nm. The former peak
is attributed to the charge transfer between the HOMO of organic to
that of the conduction band of inorganic. The sharp and narrow absorption
(∼498 nm) is attributed to the Mott type exciton, confined
within the inorganic lowest band gap. The corresponding exciton PL
peak is found to be at ∼510 nm with a fwhm of ∼16 nm.
In the case of MPEPI, the exciton strong absorption peak is at 494
nm and the corresponding PL peak is found to be at 506 nm with a fwhm
of 18 nm.

Figure 5 (a,b) shows the absorption and PL spectra of MPEPI and CEPI thin
films respectively.

As mentioned in the previous
sections, the optical exciton features
in these 2D-layered IO hybrids are strongly influenced by the characteristic
features of the organic moiety, which eventually results into structural
rearrangements of the PbI network. From Figure 1, it is evident that each lead (Pb) atom
is connected to six iodine (I), four bridging iodines to build up
the network extension, and two terminal iodines bonded to organic
through hydrogen bonding. Thus, the Pb–I–Pb bond angle
is an indicative of corner-sharing of PbI6 octahedra that
are distorted. In our previous communications,23,40 a strong correlation between the Pb–I–Pb angles to
that of exciton energies is established. It was observed that there
is systematic correlation between structural rearrangements of the
PbI octahedral extended network to that of the associated band gap.
In these 2D naturally self-assembled quantum wells, the lowest band
gap is from the inorganic network (“well”); therefore,
any structural crumpling in the Pb–I–Pb extended network
is directly reflected on the electronic band structure. It has been
established from both the experimental and electronic band structure
calculations that more crumpling of the PbI network (deviation from
planar structure 180°) results into a higher band gap (and corresponding
exciton energies).23,40 In the present case, the Pb–I–Pb
angles are observed to be ∼153.7 and ∼147.27° for
CEPI and MPEPI, respectively (Figure 1). Therefore, it is obvious that the more crumpled
(MPEPI) system shows UV side shift compared to the less crumpled CEPI
system. If we compare with other 2D IO hybrids published previously,23 (4-ClC6H4NH3)2PbI4 (4-chloroanilinium tetraiodoplumbate,
CAPI) is having a relatively more crumpling Pb–I–Pb
angle (143.01°) with the corresponding PL peak at 484 nm, while
(C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (phenyl ethylammonium tetraiodoplumbate,
PAPI) is having a more planar arrangement with the Pb–I–Pb
angle (155.43°) with red-end emission at 523 nm.

2.3 High-Resolution PL Imaging and Spectral Spatial
Mapping of IO Hybrid Crystals
Apart from structural variations,
excitons from these 2D IO hybrids are highly sensitive to thickness.
Typically, 2D alignment sustains to a thickness around 120 nm, beyond
which crystal packing gets crumpled because of heaviness. Therefore,
probing the crystal would be of worth to see the effect of crystal
packing. However, probing with conventional excitation, above the
band gap (ℏω ≥ Eg,
1PA-PL), is limited by the penetration depth (1/α0) which is few 100 s of nanometers, whereas, nonlinear pumping, that
is, two- (or more) photon excitation (2ℏω ≥ Eg,
2PA-PL) probes much deeper depths and gives a comprehensive idea of
several excitons that are clearly PbI network order-/disorder-dependent.23,24

Figure 6 presents
the 1PA-PL and 2PA-PL spectra of CEPI crystals. Here, for 1PA-PL excitations,
400 nm CW and 400 nm fs1 lasers and for 2PA-PL 800 nm, fs1 laser is
used. The deconvoluted 1PA-PL spectra for both CW and fs1 400 nm excitations
(Figure 7a,b) show
three types of emission peaks: the strong and narrow dominant peak
at 512 nm (fwhm ≈ 15 nm), a shoulder at 541 nm (fwhm ≈
20 nm), and a broad weak shoulder at 585 nm (fwhm > 60 nm). The
strong
emission features at 512 nm is attributed to free excitons (PLFE) which originates from the near-top surface. The shoulder
peak at 541 nm is attributed to crumpled excitons (PLCE) and the broad emission at 585 nm is for defect induced broad emission
(PLdef), respectively. In general, both the spectra (Figure 6a,b) are dominated
by the strong green emission at 512 nm and a shoulder at 541 nm.

Figure 6 (a) shows
1PA-PL spectra of CEPI crystal when excited by 400 nm
CW laser. The spectra are deconvoluted into free exciton (PLFE) at 512 nm, crumpled exciton (PLCE) at 541 nm, and defect-induced
emission (PLdef) at 585 nm. Similarly, (b,c) shows 1PA-PL
and 2PA-PL spectra under 400 and 800 nm (from fs1 laser) excitations,
respectively.

mapping of CEPI

nm fs1 excitation at P = 400 μW, I = 0.1 GW/cm2. (c) (i–iv) 2PA-PL crystal image
and spatial mapping of CEPI crystal under 800 nm fs1 excitation at
average power = 50 mW (I = 4 GW/cm2).
Spatial intensity images correspond to the identified peak positions
(see Figure 6).

However, in 2PA-PL (excited by 800 nm fs1 laser),
the spectrum
shows dominance of PLCE (at ∼541 nm) with a shoulder
peak at ∼570 nm (PLdef). To probe more into the
details, we have also recorded spatial and spectral imaging of CEPI
crystals for 1PA and 2PA excitations (Figure 7) with a modified microscope. As one can
see in Figure 7, the
crystal PL images show intense green color appearance when excited
by 400 nm (1PA-PL) or 800 nm (2PA-PL) lasers, which is the characteristic
of their highly emitting nature. Spatial spectral mapping was also
performed for CEPI crystal and peak intensities of respective peak
position mappings are presented in (ii–iv). In these soft 2D
materials, three types of emission centers are co-existing: (a) high-lying
free-excitons (PLFE), (b) energy down-shifted crumpled
excitons (PLCE), and (c) defect-induced emission (PLdef). However, observation of these emissions is strongly dependent
on excitation intensities and pulse widths, apart from material-related
properties such as crystal packing, thickness, temperature, and so
forth.23,24,60,61 The peak maxima spatial maps corresponding to free
excitons (PLFE ≈ 512 nm), crumpled excitons (PLCE ≈ 541 nm), and defect-induced emission (PLdef ≈ 585 nm) are shown in Figure 7. The 2PA-PL spectral spatial mapping under 800 nm
fs1 excitation shows dominating emission from crumpled excitons (PLCE) along with relatively low-intense shoulder from defect-induced
emission (PLdef) [Figure 7c(ii–iv)]. This confirms that one-photon excitation
probes free excitons (1PA-PL) related to top few nearly perfectly
aligned layers, whereas two-photon excitation probes overall crystal
(because of larger penetration depth), and the 2PA-PL is dominated
by red-end PLCE, which is related to excitons confined
within the low-lying thickness-distorted (crumpled) bond angles within
the (PbI4)2– network. Throughout the
crystal, the presence of free-exciton emission (PLFE) is
almost insignificant. This clearly supports that under the two-photon
excitation, the free-exciton level acts as a nonradiative center to
facilitate the emission from low-lying crumpled exciton level (PLCE). In general, one-photon excitation resembles typical optical
absorption, whereas the two-photon excitation process represents only
those possible based on nonlinear two-(or more) photon excitation
selection rules. Also, other nonlinearities (such as exciton–exciton
annihilation, two-photon absorption, free-carrier absorption, nonlinear
refractive index, and so forth.) possibly affect the excitation/deactivation
processes. In other 2D direct band gap materials, several diverse
radiative (bright) and nonradiative (dark) site exciton states are
reported and discussed in detail.60,61 In principle,
under conventional excitation and room-temperature conditions, such
exciton states are undetectable and easily dissociate and broaden
because of their small binding energies. Essentially, the Mott type
excitons from these soft 2D-layered hybrids are highly sensitive to
the self-assembly process, inorganic network distortions, and thickness
and interlayer distortions. Therefore, the downshifted 2PA-PL is from
the excitons related to the deep-down thickness-distorted (crumpled)
bond angles within the (PbI4)2– network.

Similarly, we have recorded 1PA-PL and 2PA-PL crystal spectra and
respective high-resolution PL images and spectral spatial mappings
(Figure 8) for MPEPI.
Similar to the case of CEPI, the 1PA-PL spectra clearly demonstrate
free excitons (PLFE ≈ 503 nm), while the 2PA-PL
is dominated by crumpled excitons (PLCE ≈ 531 nm)
(Figure 9). The spectral
peak position differences between CEPI and MPEPI, as per the crystal
structure variation, are consistent as discussed previously. It is
to be noted that the spectral/mapping/images of crystal bits are of
variable surface heights. Therefore, the spectral deviations are correspondingly
different. In general, the locations of PLFE are quite
different from PLCE. Throughout the crystal, the defect
emission (PLdef) is relatively weak but uniformly present
throughout the crystal area.

Figure 8 (a) (i–iv) 1PA-PL crystal image and spatial
mapping of MPEPI
crystal under 400 nm CW excitation at power < 1 mW. (b) (i–iv)

nm fs1 excitation at P = 400 μW, I = 0.1 GW/cm2. (c) (i–iv) 2PA-PL crystal image
and spatial mapping of MPEPI crystal under 800 nm fs1 excitation at
average power = 50 mW (I = 4 GW/cm2).
Spatial intensity images correspond to the identified peak positions
(see Figure 9).

Figure 9 (a) shows 1PA-PL spectra of the MPEPI crystal when excited
by 400
nm CW laser. The spectra are deconvoluted into free-exciton (PLFE) at 503 nm, crumpled exciton (PLCE) at 531 nm,
and defect-induced emission (PLdef) at 560 nm. Similarly
(b,c) show 1PA-PL and 2PA-PL spectra under 400 and 800 nm fs1 excitation,
respectively [for 400 fs1, P = 400 μW, (I = 0.1 GW/cm2). For 800 nm fs1, the average
power is 50 mW (I = 4 GW/cm2)].

In conventional excitation (one-photon), PL is
directly related
to the absorption coefficient (α0), following the
Beer–Lambert law as IPL ∝ I0e(−α0)t where I0 is the excitation
intensity and t is the thickness, whereas in the
case of femtosecond pulsed laser excitation, such large excitation
intensities (in the order of GW/cm2) and the resultant
PL intensities behave nonlinearly and the 2PA-PL intensity (I2PL) is related as I2PL ∝ I0e[−(α0+βI)]t. Here,
the laser intensity threshold limited third order nonlinear absorption
(β) is related to two- (or multi) photon absorption, saturation
of absorption and excited state absorption, and so on.52 Further, during the femtosecond pulse excitation,
the population of excited states is relatively fast enough and radiative,
and nonradiative processes are critically dependent on the pulse duration
and the excited state lifetimes.

3 Conclusions
Two new 2D IO-layered hybrid semiconductors (R–C6H4C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (R = CH3, Cl) are successfully synthesized
and their crystal structures have been analyzed. Both are self-assembled
into alternative stacks of a two-dimensionally extended PbI6 network, where the two organic moieties are interdigitized as spacers.
These single crystals are thermally much stable for more than 200
°C. As a virtue of dielectric contrast and quantum confinement-related
effects, these 2D IO hybrid semiconductors show strong room-temperature
Mott type exciton PL with high binding energies greater than 200 meV
and the order of magnitude greater than their parent PbI2 (∼23 meV). In the thin-film form, they are perfectly oriented
along the c-axis. The strong room-temperature exciton
emission features are highly sensitive to the local environment and
crystal packing. The spectral, imaging, and spatial mapping studies
of single crystals revealed many interesting details about their self-assembly,
crystal packing, and local environment. The comparison between the
linear and nonlinear optical excitation imaging and spatial mapping
of single crystal studies reveal the fact that two different types
of excitons are present in these systems. The conventional one-photon
absorption-induced PL (UV-excited, Eexe = ℏω ≥ Eg, 1PA-PL)
probing is restricted by shorter penetration depths (1/α0) and reveals free-exciton emission originated from perfectly
aligned 2D self-assembly from the top few layers, whereas the two-photon
absorption-related excitation (infrared excited, Eexe = 2ℏω ≥ Eg, 2PA-PL) probes much deeper depths of the crystal and demonstrates
entirely different excitons, which are energy down-shifted excitons,
originated from the locally crumpled layered arrangement. The room-temperature
exciton features and one- and two-photon imaging/spatial mapping studies
further pave way to explore these stable 2D IO semiconductors for
many new optoelectronic applications.

4 Experimental
Section
MPEPI and CEPI are prepared by conventional solution
processing
techniques.23,25,48 In both the cases, stoichiometric quantities of organic [1-(4-methylphenyl)
ethylamine or 1-(4-chlorophenyl) ethylamine] and lead (II) iodide
(PbI2) were taken in HI (55%) separately and stirred thoroughly
to get clear solutions. These two solutions were mixed together slowly
with constant stirring. The resultant precipitation is separated and
dried properly. Both MPEPI and CEPI are dissolved in the acetonitrile
solvent to get a saturated solution. Slow evaporation of saturated
solution left dark yellow-colored crystal platelets and pale yellow
rodlike crystals for CEPI and MPEPI, respectively. Suitable crystals
are selected for single crystal analysis and optical studies.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were carried out on BRUKER
AXS SMART-APEX diffractometer with a CCD area detector (Mo Kα
= 0.71073 Å, monochromator = graphite).53−55 The thin films
of MPEPI and CEPI are prepared by the spin-coating technique (typically
at 3000 rpm resulting in the uniform film thickness of 120 nm), dissolving
crystals in the acetonitrile solvent at a temperature slightly below
room temperature. These thin films are used for glancing angle X-ray
Diffraction (GAXRD) using Cu Kα (1.5418 Å) radiation. Absorption
spectra are recorded using a Shimadzu UV-VIS-NIR3600 spectrometer.
Thermo gravimetry (TG) was carried out between 25 and 800 °C
at a scan rate of 5 °C/min under N2 atmosphere using
Al2O3 as the reference material. One- and two-photon
absorption-induced photoluminescence (1PA-PL and 2PA-PL) was performed
using 400 nm CW diode laser and high-intensity femtosecond Ti:Sapphire
mode-locked oscillator laser (Spectra-Physics; MaiTai, tunable between
690 and 1040 nm, repetition rate = 84 MHz and pulse duration = 120
fs.). For 1PA-PL excitation, the sources are either from 400 nm CW
diode laser or 400 nm (frequency doubled 800 nm) fs1 laser. High-resolution
PL images, PL spatial spectral mapping of CEPI and MPEPI single crystals
were carried out using an optical upright microscope (BX51, Olympus)
by using above lasers. Spatial mapping was carried out by a controlled
motorized X–Y stage attached
with the microscope. The fiber optic-coupled spectrometer (Ocean Optics;
QEPro) is used to collect the spectra through appropriate high and
low pass filters.
