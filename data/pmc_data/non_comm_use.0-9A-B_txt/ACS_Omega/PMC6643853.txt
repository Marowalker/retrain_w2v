Although
many biosilicification methods based on cationic linear
α-poly -l- lysine for synthesis of polylysine/silica
hybrids have been investigated, these methods tend to rely on the
counteranions, added catalysts, and complex synthesis process. To
explore a simple and efficient biosilicification method, in this work,
branched poly-l-lysine (BPL) is used as both a catalyst to
hydrolyze tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and an in situ template to direct
silicic acids forming polylysine/silica hybrids in one-pot mode. The
catalysis of BPL to hydrolyze TEOS results from the abundant hydrogen
bonding (as the active site) to increase the nucleophilicity of BPL.
Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding is also found to be the key factor
determining the self-assembly of BPL. During biosilicification, owing
to self-assembly of BPL molecules, BPL would form spherical particles
by keeping a random-coil conformation or form lamellar structures
by undergoing a conformational transition from a random-coil to β-sheet
construction. As a result, polylysine/silica hybrids with tunable
topological structures are synthesized using aggregated BPLs as templates
after the hydrolysis of TEOS. This finding of applying BPL to fulfill
the biosilicification procedure without counteranions and added catalysts
would enable a better understanding of the polypeptide-governed biosilicification
process and pave a way for fabricating complex inorganic architectures
applicable to silica transformational chemistry.

Introduction
Biological organisms
are able to direct the formation of patterned
and hierarchical biominerals, and the synthesis of an organic/silica
hybrid through biosilicification is not only an active, technologically
important, but also relatively a mature field.1,2 Over
the past decade, biomimetic synthesis has been applied to investigate
biological systems and in the preparation of organic/silica hybrids
for photonics, biomedical implants, drug delivery, biochemical separation,
and so on.3,4 Although many achievements have been made,
it is still necessary to get a deep understanding of the biosilicification
operating principles on the molecular level. It is well known that
the silicic acid uptake, storage/transport, and deposition involved
in biosilicification process are under a strict biological control.5 In natural systems, polypeptides usually serve
as scaffolds to control the nucleation, growth, and structure of organic/silica
hybrids because of their capability of self-assembling and structure
directing of small species into hybrid materials.6

The biological function is derived from a variety
of the conformations
adopted by polypeptides, most prominently α-helices and β-sheets.7−9 As a basic amino acid unit in peptides, lysine has received much
attention because of its relatively simple structure and diverse conformational
changes.10−16 For example, Shantz utilized the cationic linear α-poly-l-lysine (LPL) to synthesize polylysine/silica hybrid particles
in the presence of a NaOH catalyst. The conformation of LPL could
tune the porosity of resulted particles.11 Furthermore, Naik further exploited the conformation variety of
LPL to alter the morphology of biosilicification products from spherical
particles to hexagonal platelets in the presence of a HCl catalyst
and phosphate anions.12−15 The morphological evolution of polylysine/silica hybrids was attributed
to the conformation change from a random-coil to α-helix architecture
of LPL.12−15 Similar phenomena were also found in the double-hydrophilic polylysine-b-polyethylene glycol and amphiphilic polylysine-b-polyleucine diblock copolymer mediated biosilicification
and so on.17−19 To the best of our knowledge, it is generally agreed
that LPL, counteranions, and added catalysts are all indispensable
in the completion of conformation transition during a biosilicification
procedure. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to conclude that the counteranions
play an important role in determining the self-assembly and structure-directing
functionality of LPL, which would further affect the morphology of
polylysine/silica hybrid products.15−20

Herein, to explore an efficient and simple biosilicification
pathway
to prepare polylysine/silica hybrids with controllable morphology
for certain applications, branched poly-l-lysine (BPL) is
used as both a catalyst to hydrolyze tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and
an in situ template to direct silicic acids forming polylysine/silica
hybrids in one-pot mode. The catalysis of BPL to hydrolyze TEOS results
from the abundant hydrogen bonding (as the active site) to increase
the nucleophilicity of BPL. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding is also
found to be the key factor determining the self-assembly of BPL. During
biosilicification, owing to self-assembly of BPL molecules, BPL would
keep a random-coil conformation to form spherical particles with diameter
in nanometers or undergo a conformational transition from a random-coil
to β-sheet construction to form lamellar structures with sizes
in the range of micrometers. As a result, polylysine/silica hybrids
with tunable topological structures are synthesized using aggregated
BPLs as templates after the hydrolysis of TEOS. This finding of applying
BPL to fulfill the biosilicification procedure without counteranions
and added catalysts would enable a better understanding of the polypeptide-governed
biosilicification process and pave a way for fabricating complex inorganic
architectures applicable to silica transformational chemistry.

Results
and Discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, BPLs with different morphologies are directly
synthesized through
thermal polymerization of commercial lysine in aqueous solution. BPL
assemblies could be spherical particles or adopt a belt or flake structure
by controlling the branching degree (BD) of BPLs. As shown in Table 1, the products under
different synthesis conditions are denoted BPL-x,
where x represents the experimental entry. BPLs are
then used as catalysts to hydrolyze TEOS and subsequently in situ
utilized as templates to direct silicic acids to form polylysine/silica
hybrids in one-pot mode. As a result, polylysine/silica hybrids with
tunable topological structures are synthesized using aggregated BPLs
without any added catalysts and counteranions.

ammonium bromide (CTAB) is 0.01 mg/mL.

The characteristic groups of BPL are determined by 1H NMR spectra between 2.4 and 4.3 ppm (Figure 1). This allows the identification of four
different structural units, which are distinguished by the number
and type of functional groups forming chemical bonds: linear units
(Lε and Lα), dendritic units (D), and terminal units (T) (Figure 2).21,22 For dendritic units (D),
both one carboxyl group and two amino groups of a lysine molecule
react, whereas only the carboxyl group forms chemical bonds in terminal
units (T). When the carboxyl and one amino group
participate in the reaction, the two kinds of linear units (Lε and Lα) are formed. As shown in Figure 1a–c, 1H NMR (D2O) spectra
of BPL-1 (a lysine monomer with a trace degree of polymerization,
as the control) show that δ = 3.46–3.38 (α-CH)
and 2.79–2.72 (ε-CH2), whereas those of BPL-2
and BPL-3 show that δ = 4.22–4.08 (α-CHD), 3.98–3.84 (α- CHLα), 3.54–3.32 (α-CHT), and 2.77–2.59 (α- CHLε). Obviously, there is a huge difference
in signal intensity between the strong solvent peak (D2O, δ = 4.35–5.24) and the weak structure peaks, which
leads to the gradient baseline in Figure 1a. The relative fractions of the different
structural units can be determined from the integral areas of each
α-CH signal.21−23 The BD of BPL-2 and BPL-3 is calculated according
to eq 1 and shown in Table 1, which is defined
as a parameter to describe the topological structures of BPL. In this
work, the BD of the monomer is assumed to be 0. The amide bonds in
BPL-3 are also observed from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra,
as presented in Figure S1. Compared with
those in BPL-1, new absorption peaks at 1662, 3380, and 3495 cm–1 appeared in BPL-3, proving the formation of amide
bonds. The reaction yields are measured by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), as shown in Figure 3. The conversion ratio of lysine is defined
as the yield that is calculated as the percentage of BPL for each
sample. We observe that the yields of BPL-1 and BPL-3 are about 4.9
and 57.2%, respectively. The yields for all BPLs have been reported
in Table 1. The average
molar mass of BPL-3 is estimated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), as shown in Figure 4. There are many MALDI-TOF peaks for BPL-3
found between 130.0841 and 1169.5185, indicating that the polymerization
degree of BPL-3 is between 1 and 8. The MALDI-TOF data for the rest
of BPLs are listed in Figure S2. From the
MALDI-TOF data, we confirm that the polymerization degrees of BPLs
are widely distributed between 4 and 20.

Since lysine–lysine is a self-complementary hydrogen-bonding
unit,24a BPL could undergo spontaneous
self-assembly to form the supramolecular assemblies in aqueous solution.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is employed to characterize
the spatial size of BPL. Figures S3a and 5a reveal spherical particles with average diameters
of 1.3 ± 0.5 and 10.1 ± 2.7 nm for BPL-2 and BPL-3, respectively,
and no legible assemblies are found from BPL-1 (Figure S3b). Compared to the results from the above TEM images
and Table 1, it can
be seen that, when the BD of BPL increases, the spatial sizes of BPL
assemblies increase, probably more protonated amino groups are taking
part in the formation of hydrogen bonds. This implies that hydrogen
bonding might be the critical factor to control self-assembly of BPLs,
which would further affect morphology and topological structures of
BPL assemblies. To testify the above presumption, several experiments
are conducted subsequently, as shown in Table 1, by adjusting hydrogen bonding through adding
additives and changing the concentration of lysine. For example, CTAB
(0.01 mg/mL) as an efficient cationic surfactant, which could offer
more protonated amine groups in water solution and lead to the enhancement
of hydrogen bonding,24b,24c is added into the reaction system
to synthesize BPL-4 (BD: 0.36). BPL-4 has the nanoflake structure
with the size ranging from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers,
as shown in Figure S4. When increasing
the concentration of lysine to 10 mg/mL, BPL-5 possessing a similar
flake structure (BD: 0.55) is also prepared, as shown in Figure 5b. By adding N-octadecane into the reaction system, BPL-6 with a nanobelt
structure (BD: 0.52) can be synthesized, as shown in Figure 5c. Thus, it is found that the
morphologies of BPLs could evolve from zero-dimensional spherical
particles to two-dimensional lamellar structures by increasing the
hydrogen bonding of the reaction environment, and meanwhile resulting
in the higher BD of BPL. To further explore the above phenomenon,
ethanol is added into the reaction system to prepare BPL-7, BPL-8,
and BPL-9, since ethanol could furnish a variety of hydroxyl groups
in water solution. As shown in Figure 1d, 1H NMR (D2O) of BPL-8 show
that δ = 3.86–3.78 (α-CHD), 3.74–3.54 (the hydroxyl of EtOH), 3.49–3.42 (α-CHLα), 3.39–3.32 (α-CHT), and 3.03–2.90 (α-CHLε). The respective BDs of BPL-7,
BPL-8, and BPL-9 are 0.63, 0.71, and 0.78, whereas the corresponding
morphologies are cagelike, cobweb-cladding, and pentagram structures
(Figure 5d–f).
Hence, the BD and topological structures of BPL are mainly subjected
to the effect of hydrogen bonding within the reaction circumstances.

It is well known that
there are generally three factors controlling
the biosilicification process: catalytic effect, aggregation promotion
effect, and structure-directing effect.2,5 Herein, the
catalytic effect stems from the self-catalysis of BPL; the aggregation
promotion and structure-directing effects are caused efficiently by
self-assembly of BPL. The formation process of polylysine/silica hybrids
involves the catalysis of BPL to TEOS and the morphology copy through
electrostatic interaction between BPL and negatively charged silicate
species, which sequentially influences the overall morphology of the
silica hybrid. Thus, when TEOS is added to the lysine–water
solution under moderate agitation for a while at 60 °C, about
92% of ε-(CH2)4NH2 group and
33% of α-NH2 group are protonated, resulting in the
increase of the initial pH value of the solution to 9.1–9.2.1 Meanwhile, the TEOS is gradually hydrolyzed into
silicic acid. This self-catalytic reaction mechanism is similar to
that of the structurally related proteases and other hydrolases, in
which the abundant hydrogen bonding acts cooperatively as the active
site to increase the nucleophilicity of BPL. As a result, the nucleophilic
BPL contains protonated hydroxyl and amine groups, which are able
to catalyze hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS and produce silica
subsequently.25−28 In this work, polylysine/silica hybrids with a spherical shape (average
diameters of 20 ± 2.5 nm), porous flake, and hollow belt are
selectively synthesized (Figure 6). To confirm the participation of polypeptides, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to determine the presence
of nitrogen on the surface of polylysine/silica nanoparticles, as
shown in Figure S5. When looking into these
morphological copies between the BPL templates and silicic acids,
it is found that the hydrogen bonding could guarantee the stability
of BPL templates and the precise one-to-one site-specific integration
mapping between BPLs and silicic acids is provided by the electrostatic
force. Taking the porous polylysine/silica flakes as an example (Figure 6b), during the biosilicification,
negatively charged silicic acids bring themselves into BPL-4 assemblies
and meanwhile CTAB molecules move around BPL-4 flakes and occupy the
molecular space, which results in the formation of pores with 2 nm
in diameter (the inset in Figure 6b). Besides, the height images of the polylysine/silica
flake and belt are measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization
(Figure S6). AFM analysis reveals that
the thicknesses of the polylysine/silica flake and belt are around
20 ± 2 and 17 ± 1 nm, respectively. However, the morphology
of polylysine/silica mediated by BPL-7 and BPL-9 is neither the cagelike
nor pentagram structures, as shown in Figure S7, which is not consistent with the BPL templates. Because lysine
is hardly dissolved in the solution containing a large amount of organic
additives (such as ethanol), ethanol would generate an electrostatic
shielding effect and then disturb the accurate interfacial molecular
recognition among the BPL templates and silicic acids, which is believed
to be the reason for the morphological difference between BPLs and
polylysine/silica products.

As has been verified by many studies, the conformation transitions
of polypeptides associated with self-assembly are mainly responsible
for the morphological evolution of polylysine/silica products. The
circular dichroism (CD) spectra are recorded to demonstrate the variation
in the conformation of BPLs. As shown in Figure 7, without counteranions and silicic acids,
BPL would undergo a conformational transition from a random-coil to
β-sheet construction as long as hydrogen bonding becomes strong,
thereby providing the assistance to overcome kinetic limitations in
self-assembly of BPLs. For example, the CD spectrum of BPL-3 shows
a minimum at around 210 nm (Figure 7a), similar to that of a star-shaped core–shell
copolymer (PEI10000-g-LPL20),29 indicating the random-coil conformation
of BPL-3. This phenomenon appears to conflict with the characteristic
peak of linear LPL whose random-coil conformation is characterized
by a negative minimum at around 198 nm.15−19 The bathochromic shift in the minimum or maximum
wavelength is reasonably ascribed to the specific branched structure.29−31 In comparison, BPL-4 predominantly adopts a β-sheet conformation,
as evidenced by a negative band at 203 nm and a positive band at 240
nm. Generally, the positive peak at 21031 or 218 nm29 could be a characteristic
of type II β-turns. The formation of a 10-atom hydrogen-bonded
ring by C–O···H–N in this β-turns
system is believed to be responsible for the bathochromic shift in
the maximum wavelength.32 Yet, the curves
in Figure 7b also indicate
that BPL-5 and BPL-8 are all taking a β-sheet structure, as
the hydrogen bonding has been increased significantly. It is well
known that the β-sheet conformation of polypeptides had been
studied intensively because of its important role in the application
of fibrillization and design of well-defined functional materials.6,33−39 However, the comprehensive study of the β-sheet structure
of polylysines has been seldom conducted in previous reports. We think
this work would lay the foundation for deepening the understanding
of synthesis and application of β-sheet-structured polylysines.

Generally speaking, both of the linear-polylysine- and branched-polylysine-based
biosilicification methods could be used to synthesize the polylysine/silica
hybrids. The branched polylysine backbone interacts with the silicate
species in the solution via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.
Besides, the linear polylysine backbone still needs the participation
of ionic interactions from counteranions to guarantee the conformation
transition and silica condensation. The combination of all of the
above interactions results in the packing of the polypeptide chains
and also the progress of the silicification reaction.

Conclusions
In summary, through the in situ formation of branched polylysines
prepared in aqueous solution during a biosilicification procedure,
polylysine/silica hybrids with tunable topological structures are
synthesized in one-pot mode without added catalysts and counteranions.
The
mechanistic studies show that BPL is used as both a catalyst to hydrolyze
TEOS and an in situ template to direct silicic acids to form polylysine/silica
hybrids. The catalysis of BPL to hydrolyze TEOS results from the abundant
hydrogen bonding (as the active site) to increase the nucleophilicity
of BPL. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding is also found to be the key
factor determining the self-assembly of BPL to form aggregates with
different shapes. The proposed mechanism explains the self-catalysis
and self-assembly and conformation transition of BPL during a biosilicification
procedure. We believe that these findings would enable a better understanding
of the polypeptide-governed biosilicification process and pave the
way for fabricating complex inorganic architectures based on silica
transformational chemistry.

Experimental Section
Materials
l-Lysine (98%) was bought from Aladdin,
and N-octadecane (OCT, 99%) was purchased from Alfa
Aesar. Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%) was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 99.9%) and ethanol (EtOH,
98%) were purchased from China National Medicines Corporation Ltd.
They were used without purification.

Synthesis of Branched Poly-l-lysine
BPL was
synthesized by thermal polymerization of the lysine monomer in aqueous
solution. The lysine solution was prepared by adding 2 g of commercial
dry lysine powders into a round-bottomed flask containing deionized
water. After moderate agitation for a while, additives were then introduced
into the solution. The BPL solutions were synthesized under different
experimental conditions, as shown in Table 1.

Synthesis of Polylysine/Silica Hybrids
The polylysine/silica
hybrids were prepared as follows. Without changing the reaction temperature
of synthesis of branched poly-l-lysine, 100 g of TEOS was
dropped into the BPL solution under magnetic stirring. After biosilicification
was carried out for 24 h at the corresponding reaction temperature
in Table 1, the samples
were centrifuged and rinsed with distilled water and ethanol five
times. At last, the polylysine/silica hybrids were dried at 80 °C
for 8 h in a vacuum oven.

Characterization
Nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400
MHz spectrometer using
D2O as the solvent. Infrared spectra were recorded on a
Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer. 64 scans were collected with a
spectral resolution of 2 cm–1, and the samples were
mixed with KBr in a proportion of 0.5–1 wt % and compressed
into a thin disk before analysis. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was conducted on the Hanbon EasyChrom-1000 HPLC system fitted
with a reversed-phase C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm2).
The samples were injected in 5 mL aliquots and eluted at 0.7 mL/min
with a mobile phase consisting of 90% deionized water and 10% methanol
solution. The oligomeric products were detected at 195 nm, and the
data were analyzed with Hanbon Science and Technologies EasyChrom-1000
Software. High-resolution mass spectra from matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) were obtained on
a BrukermicroTOF-QII using the positive electrospray ionization method
and positive ion mode with a 355 nm smart beam laser. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on a JEM-1011 transmission
electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a VG ESCALAB MK
II spectrometer using Al Kα radiation from an X-ray source operated
at 10.0 kV and 10 mA. The samples for XPS were purified by centrifugation
and redispersed five times with deionized water. The height images
of the silica flakes and silica belts were acquired using tapping-mode
atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a hot stage (Nanoscope IIIa MultiMode,
Digital Instruments). The sample for AFM observation was prepared
by spin-coating on a clean silicon wafer at room temperature. The
silica flake and silica belt solutions were about 1 mg/mL in EtOH.
The silicon wafers with samples were dried under vacuum at 60 °C
overnight. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a JASCO
J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled water
bath. The background scans of additive (OCT/CTAB/EtOH) solutions were
recorded and manually subtracted from the scans. The samples (10 mL)
were then loaded into a 1 mm path length quartz cuvette to obtain
data from 270 to 190 nm (at a rate of 50 nm/min) at every nanometer
with a 1 nm bandwidth. Three scans for each of the duplicate samples
were acquired and automatically averaged. The branching degree (BD)
of the branched polylysines was calculated by eq 1(22) from the mole
fraction of structural units: D, Lε and Lα, and T, which were determined by integrating the areas of the
α-CH signals corresponding to different structural units in
the 1H NMR spectra. In eq 1, the BD of the monomer was assumed to be 0. 1
