Functional three-dimensional (3D)
microstructures incorporating
accessible interiors have emerged as a versatile platform for biosystem
applications. By configuring their 3D geometric features, these biosystem
microdevices can accurately evaluate and control targeted bioenvironments.
However, classical fabrication techniques based on photolithography-etching
processes cannot precisely and programmably control the geometric
of the entire hollow 3D microstructures. Here, we proposed the use
of a two-photon polymerization (TPP)-based technique for the precise,
straightforward, and customizable preparation of hollow 3D microstructure
devices with small opening(s). Factors governing the formation of
hollow 3D biosystem microdevices, including material composition,
laser input, and (post-) development treatment, have been systematically
investigated and a set of optimized conditions are presented as a
starting point for the development of novel hollow biosystem microdevices.
To evaluate the broad applicability of this approach, a series of
tailored hollow 3D microdevices with small opening(s), including a
micropore, microneedle, microelectrode, microvalve, and micromachine,
were successfully prepared using our direct laser writing-TPP technique.
To further validate the feasibility of these biosystem microdevices
in practical implementations, we demonstrated the use of hollow 3D
micropore devices for the robust resistive-pulse analysis of nanoparticles.

Introduction
Biosystem microdevices
are microstructures used for the analysis
or handling of biological compounds, and their development has both
enhanced performance and increased throughput in modern biological
research and applications.1−4 With recent advances in nano-/microfabrication technology
having led to the implementation of multiscale, hollow, three-dimensional
(3D) microstructure devices with accessible interiors, these benefits
are stronger than ever.5,6 Hollow 3D microstructures engineered
for both electrical and chemical functions have shown great potential
for creating well-controlled microdevices that tackle the issues encountered
in intricate biosystems, including biochemical sensing,7,8 pharmaceutical delivery,9 neural interfacing,10 biofluid manipulation,11 and biomedical therapy.11

To date,
fabrication strategies utilized for hollow 3D microstructures
have been dominated by photolithography–etching processes.12,13 However, because of the harsh processing conditions involved, candidate
materials suitable for these methods are mostly limited to silicon-based
inorganic substrates. Furthermore, these fabrication strategies can
only generate limited geometries for hollow microstructures, resulting
in a strong research focus on shapes like micropores and microneedles.5 Given the geometric constraints in chemical etching
processes, it is currently not possible to control the geometric features
of hollow structures in all three dimensions.14,15 Further geometric control of hollow 3D microstructures can be achieved
using enhanced lithographic techniques, such as electron-beam lithographies
for micropores and nanosphere lithographies for scaffolds.16,17 Nonetheless, these modified lithographic methods are still not able
to precisely control the full 3D geometry of hollow microstructures,
yielding pseudo-3D structures with a limited range of geometries and
functions.12 Thus, there is a real desire
to develop fabrication technologies that can accurately produce complex
hollow 3D microstructures of any desired geometry.

Direct laser
writing (DLW) via two-photon polymerization (TPP)
is emerging as a powerful alternative to photolithographic methods
for the rapid 3D fabrication of microstructures.18−20 TPP reactions
can be spatiotemporally controlled, a capability that provides the
possibility of reliably fabricating tailored hollow 3D microstructures
with nanoscale resolution.21,22 During the TPP process,
the photoresist polymerizes to generate insoluble polymeric networks,
and by programming the laser focal point to move in 3D space, 3D microstructures
can be formed.23,24 It is important to note that
for TPP to create hollow 3D microstructures, the unpolymerized soluble
photoresist trapped inside the structure must be thoroughly removed
through opening holes leading into the inner hollow space.25 To our knowledge, no existing work has specifically
explored the use of the DLW-TPP technique for the fabrication of tailored
hollow 3D biosystem microdevices with small opening(s). Therefore,
factors that ultimately determine the viability of TPP for the fabrication
of hollow 3D biosystem microdevice structures, such as the broad range
of processing settings, including both material issues (resist type,
mechanical property and biocompatibility, etc.) and fabrication aspects
(slicer parameters, laser power, development condition, etc.), remain
unassessed.

Here, we propose the use of the DLW-TPP technique
with optimized
fabrication parameters for the precise preparation of tailored hollow
3D microstructure devices with accessible interiors. In this work,
factors that govern the ultimate structural quality, including slicer
parameters, laser input, post-development treatment, and material
choice, were comprehensively investigated and are thoroughly discussed.
To demonstrate the ubiquitous applicability of this DLW-TPP-based
fabrication technique, we created a series of model hollow 3D microstructure
devices that are representative of a broad variety of biosystem applications,
such as micropores for nanoparticle sensing, microneedles for pharmaceutical
delivery, microelectrodes for neural recording/stimulation, microvalves
for biofluid controlling, and micromachines for biomedical therapy.
Furthermore, to validate that this technique can create practical
hollow 3D microstructures for biosystem utilizations, we fabricated
hollow micropore devices with geometries tailored for resistive-pulse
sensing (RPS) of nanoparticles. Because of the high resolution of
this fabrication process, these micropore devices demonstrate robust
analytical performance, providing calibration-free nanoparticle size
measurements. Generally, these investigations suggest that the DLW-TPP
technique serves as a promising fabrication platform for tailored
hollow 3D biosystem microdevices with small opening(s).

Results and Discussion
The DLW-TPP process for fabricating hollow 3D microdevices is illustrated
in Figure 1. Here,
the commercial photonics professional system (Nanoscribe GmbH, Germany)
was used to perform the 3D DLW-TPP fabrication process. The underlying
TPP mechanism and polymerization schemes are detailed in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 1a, the liquid photoresist
was used as the immersion fluid between the microscope lens (25×,
0.8 NA, Zeiss) and the loading substrate. During DLW, a femtosecond
laser pulse (80 MHz, 100 fs) was redirected and focused inside a droplet
of the photoresist to trigger the TPP reactions that cross-link the
polymeric resist material (see Figure 1b). Significantly, the reactive resist volume is strictly
restricted to a nano-sized unit (voxel),26 allowing 3D fabrication of structures with nanoscale resolution
(see Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic

immersion mode. Femtosecond laser pulse source: 780 nm, 80 MHz, 100
fs. Peak power: ∼25 kW. Highest fluence level: ∼1 J/cm2. Inset picture: XYZ-3D movable sample stage.
(b) Schematic graph of the DLW process. Hollow 3D microstructures
were sketched by a CAD program. Under femtosecond laser pulse irradiation,
photoresist polymers are cross-linked to form solidified hollow 3D
microstructure devices. In this work, the size of opening ranges from
500 nm to 6 μm.

Control of microdevice surface properties in turn controls
the
functionality and performance of hollow 3D microdevices and is necessary
to allow their uses in many biosystem applications.27,28 To evaluate the ability of DLW to precisely control surface properties,
a series of conic hollow 3D micropore structures were fabricated under
different processing conditions. In preparation, two structural processing
settings—slicing distance and hatching distance (see Figure 2a)—were combined
to regulate the exposure area of the material used in the DLW fabrication
process. Figure 2b
illustrates the surface morphologic profiles of the conic hollow 3D
micropores prepared using different slicing–hatching parameters,
ranging from nanoscale (slicing dxy: 100 nm, hatching lz: 200 nm) to micronscale (slicing dxy: 1000 nm, hatching lz: 1200 nm). For conical hollow micropores prepared
by nanoscale (dxy: 100
nm, lz: 200 nm) slicing
parameters, the structures displayed a flawless, smooth surface profile
(Ra = 81 ± 10 nm). As the slicing
and hatching distances were gradually increased, the hollow 3D microstructures
showed a tendency toward a more rugged surface in appearance (see Figure 2c, blue line).

structural processing settings on the surface morphologic
profiles of prepared hollow conic 3D micropore structures. (a) Schematic
slicing (left) and hatching (right) patterns for the DLW-TPP process

time for the fabrication of hollow 3D microstructures vs structural
processing conditions.

As we further increase the slicing and hatching distances
in TPP
fabrication, cracks of varying sizes could be formed on the surface
of the prepared hollow 3D microstructures (Figure 2c, black curve). These cracks can be controlled
and may provide useful functions for biosystem microdevices, such
as in pharmaceutical delivery systems requiring the controlled release
of drug/vaccine products.29,30 Meanwhile, these parameters
also affected the overall processing time of the DLW process (Figure 2d). Hollow 3D microstructures
prepared using finer slicing–hatching parameters to give a
crack-free surface required longer processing times. Taken together,
hollow 3D biosystem microdevices with accurately controlled surface
profiles can be realized via the DLW-TPP process.

The opening
hole of a hollow 3D microdevice is essential for the
overall performance quality in many biosystem implementations, that
is, for the access of (bio)analytes into the interior functional structure.
Therefore, to create high-performing hollow 3D biosystem microdevices,
it is essential to optimize the processing parameters that govern
the formation process of the opening hole (e.g., laser power and development
conditions, etc.). As shown in Figure 3a, the quality of the opening hole could be dramatically
influenced by the input laser power (fluence) levels. To quantitatively
evaluate these laser-induced effects on the quality of formed circular
opening holes, we herein introduce the ratio rcircularity (0 ≤ rcircularity ≤ 1), with which a higher rcircularity value corresponds to a higher quality hole. The results indicated
that input laser pulses with low power levels (<40%) were not able
to yield opening(s) with accurately defined geometric features as
the applied laser was not strong enough to polymerize the resist material
[Figure 3a, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image 1–3].

Figure 3 (a) Effect of the laser
power level (fluence) on the quality of
incorporated opening hole structures. Upper: SEM images of the built-in
circular opening parts (Ø = 3 μm) prepared
under different power levels. Down: Circularity ratio of the built-in
circular opening parts prepared under different power levels. Full
power level (100%): ∼1 J/cm2. Threshold power level:
∼40%, dynamic power range: 50–60%, damage power range:
>70%. Scale bar: 5 μm, apply to all eight SEM images. (b)
Opening
holes with distinct geometric shapes incorporated within fabricated
hollow 3D microstructure devices, left to right: triangle, rectangle,
pentagon, hexagon, and pentagram. Scale bar: 3 μm, apply to
all five SEM images.

As the laser fluence level approached the threshold (∼40%
for IP-S resist), the opening holes showed clean and sharp circular
shapes, exactly as CAD-designed. Within the working fluence range
(50–60% for IP-S), the reactive resist volume was strictly
confined to a single building unit (slicing dxy: 300 nm, hatching lz: 400 nm), creating accurately controlled
opening hole structures with nanoscale resolution. Significantly,
accurate formation of opening hole structures facilitates the wash-away
process of the trapped resist during the development process, which
is necessary to produce clean and accurate hollow 3D microdevices
(Figure S2). Further increments in laser
fluence above the working range would lead to opening structures with
degraded quality (Figure 3a, SEM image 7 and 8). At higher fluence levels, the overexposed
photoresist undergoes optical damage, which causes imperfections (e.g.,
cracks, surface debris, etc.) in the formed opening holes.31

Promisingly, this technique allows opening
holes to be created
based on arbitrary shapes. As shown in Figure 3b, opening hole structures with distinct
geometric shapes (triangle, rectangular, pentagon, hexagon, and pentagram)
were realized in hollow 3D microdevices. Our results suggest that
the optimum laser power level for accurate opening hole formation
is solely determined by the material properties of the utilized resist
and is independent of the actual hole geometry (Table S1). The white ring visible at the entrance of the openings
is likely an artifact of the platinum sputtering process used to coat
the structures for SEM imaging, as the sharp edge of the opening cannot
be easily coated with a uniform Pt layer using conventional sputtering
processes. Therefore, DLW-TPP may serve as a universal platform for
creating precise hollow 3D biosystem microdevices with tailored opening
hole(s).

The suitable working temperature of biosystems varies
broadly.
To verify the extensive applicability of these hollow 3D micro-devices,
it is essential to scrutinize their geometric stability under different
temperatures. Figure S3 demonstrates the
effects of increasing temperatures on the geometric properties of
prepared hollow 3D microdevices. To quantify these temperature effects,
we investigated the shrinkage rate of their opening holes. The temperature-induced
geometric change was still below 5% even when the temperature was
increased from room temperature to a high value (70 °C) and then
rapidly cooled (−20 °C) to freeze the device in a shrunken
state, indicating that these DLW-TPP-prepared hollow 3D microstructures
possess good geometric stability over a broad temperature spectrum.

Hollow 3D microdevices with accessible interiors have been extensively
investigated to resolve the thorny problems in biosystems.2,3,32,33 Importantly, biocompatibility of these microdevices could be modified
either through surface modification/functionalization or by using
biocompatible photoresists as the bulk material34−36 to seamlessly
integrate with the biosystems being analyzed (Table S2). It is worthwhile to note that the design of the
hollow interior can impact or even govern the fundamental functionality
of the prepared hollow 3D microdevices. Promisingly, the biosystem
microdevices fabricated in this paper using the DLW-TPP technique
possess tailored geometric features both interior and exterior and
offered customizable functionality and performance. As shown in Figure 4a,b, hollow microneedles
suitable for enhanced pharmaceutical delivery were prepared. Through
the fine-tuning of geometric features (i.e., surface roughness, surface
cracks and interior hollow, etc.), drug/vaccine products loaded inside
the hollow space or anchored on the microdevice surface could be released
in a spatiotemporally controlled manner.27,29 Additionally, these solidified hollow 3D microneedle structures
exhibited sufficient mechanical stability and rigidity to penetrate
the skin without inducing any structural fracture (EYoung ≈ 2–3 GPa for IP-S resist, see Figure S4). Furthermore, highly controllable
hollow microneedle array patches can be readily manufactured for various
bioapplication purposes, as shown in Figure S5.

Figure 4c
shows
a microelectrode that could simultaneously stimulate and record neural
signals by integrating the functions of chemical stimulus delivery
and electrical signal recording. The conductivity of microelectrodes
fabricated by DLW-TPP can be tuned to improve their electrical signal
recording capability, via coating of conducting metal thin films on
the surface (Table S3) or by using intrinsically
conductive photoresist materials.37,38 Importantly,
the demonstrated hollow 3D microelectrode has a tip size smaller than
10 μm and features micropores allowing chemical delivery, sampling,
or perfusion through the electrode. This would enable precise manipulations
and interactions at the single-cell level.6,10Figure 4d demonstrates the
possibility of a hollow microvalve structure containing sophisticated
internal movable components. Such microvalves could be used to accurately
control and sense biofluidic flow conditions in various biosystems
with the advantage of being manufactured out of biocompatible materials. Figure 4e shows an example
of a micromachine-inspired structure produced with the DLW-TPP technique.
Similar structures have been fabricated using traditional chemical
and photolithographic techniques in the literature, driven by self-propelling,
chemical fuels, electric fields, or surface tension.39−41 The internal and external geometric features at the core of these
devices could easily and accurately be produced via DLW-TPP based
on simple CAD designs, greatly simplifying their production process.
For use cases requiring individual, detached hollow 3D microdevices,
ultrasonic treatments (∼10–30 s) have proven to be a
robust tool that facilitates the release of these microdevices from
the loading substrate (see Figure S6).
Therefore, with its ability to precisely specify geometry and operate
on a wide spectrum of photoresist materials, DLW-prepared hollow 3D
microdevices would shed light on an extensive range of unexplored
use cases.

To validate the practical applicability of these
hollow 3D microdevices,
we performed robust resistive-pulse analysis of nanoparticles using
the DLW-TPP-prepared conic hollow 3D micropores. RPS has become a
prominent technique for the high-throughput particle-by-particle characterization
of colloid suspensions of individual (bio)analytes in biosystems.7,42,43 One crucial part of this characterization
system is the sensitive nano-/microhollow hole, the preparation of
which has been the subject of enormous interest in recent years. However,
traditional preparation techniques suffer from several severe deficiencies:
solid-state holes typically rely on etching, puncturing, or heating-and-pulling
methods which do not give tight control over the internal pore geometry,
whilst biological pores are limited to very small size regimes and
are not suitable for all chemicals or analytes.

The DLW-TPP
technique presented in this paper provides a feasible
resolution for these critical issues encountered in RPS pore preparation.
To explore this, we successfully prepared optimized hollow 3D micropores
assembled on a plastic substrate (∼1 cm × 1 cm polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), see Figures 5a and S7), for the high-performance
resistive-pulse analysis of nanoparticles. The substrate microhole
structure (≈Ø 100 μm) beneath the
DLW-prepared conic micropore device was created via a hybrid additive–subtractive
fabrication process employing both the method of this paper and our
newly developed maskless 3D laser ablation technique44 (Figure S8). Figure 5b schematically shows the two-counter
electrode configuration of the resistive-pulse characterization system,
in which the prepared micropore structure works as an effective sensitive
component for the RPS system (see Figure S9a).

In RPS characterization,
the applied external working voltage induced
the transient ionic current flowing through the hollow 3D micropore
structure. We prepared hollow 3D micropore structures with variable-sized
(Ø: 1–5 μm) circular opening hole.
Static i–v curves of these
hollow micropore structures were recorded in Figure 5c. The results showed that, at any particular
working voltage, the magnitude of the transient ionic current (conductivity)
linearly (R2 = 0.9927) increased with
the circular opening hole size (see Figure S9c), a phenomenon that is modeled by Vogel et al.45 1  in which V is the applied
voltage, DS is the small-side hole size, Dl is the large-side hole size, LC is the conical hole length, and ρ is the electrolyte
resistivity (see Figure S9b). This study
on the transient current behavior suggests that our DLW-TPP-prepared
micropore devices could be used for practical RPS experiments.

To confirm this, we performed RPS-based nanoparticle size analysis
to verify the robustness of these hollow 3D micropore devices. In
testing, hollow 3D micropore structures with precisely defined circular
opening holes (Ø = 3 μm) were prepared
(see Figure S7). As shown in Figure 5d, a decrease in ionic current
(“current blockade”) occurs as each individual nanoparticle
translocates through the hollow micropore structure. The overall current
plot and other analysis results for the RPS experiment are shown in Figure S10. Figure 5e shows the combined magnitude distributions
of current blockades corresponding to each type of the analyzed nanoparticle
solution (114–530 nm, see Figure S11). The magnitude of the mode current blockade increased remarkably
as the analyzed nanoparticle size was increased from 114 to 530 nm
(as modeled below by eq 2). We then calculated the volume of each type of nanoparticle based
on its nominal size and recorded the corresponding current blockade
magnitude (mode value) for each measurement (Table S5). These were plotted against each other, and the resulting
graph (see Figure 5g) displays a highly linear relationship (R2 = 0.9921) between the nanoparticle volume and the magnitude
of corresponding current blockade, as predicted by Kozak et al.46,47 2   3   4  in which ΔR is the
resistance change, d is the nanoparticle diameter,
Δi is the current blockade, and V is nanoparticle volume size. As a result, these DLW-TPP-prepared
hollow 3D micropore devices create new opportunities for the accurate,
straightforward, and low-cost differentiation of nanoparticles/analytes
in biosystems, via the use of the RPS technique (Figure 5f).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have successfully developed a precise, controllable,
and straightforward DLW-TPP-based additive fabrication strategy, for
the preparation of tailored hollow 3D biosystem microdevices. Unlike
conventional fabrication techniques, the DLW-TPP fabrication scheme
provides superior control over the full geometric properties (both
interior and exterior) of the fabricated device. With a well-established
fabrication process, we now can systematically and accurately modulate
the processing conditions, including slicer parameters, laser input,
and development treatment, to tune the functionality of these customized
hollow 3D biosystem microdevices. We have demonstrated that the tailored
hollow 3D microstructure devices produced by our technique hold great
potential for biosystem applications, including micropores for biochemical
sensing, microneedles for pharmaceutical delivery, microelectrodes
for neural recording, microvalves for biofluidic measurement and manipulation,
and micromachines for biomedical therapy. To further confirm the suitability
of the DLW-TPP-fabricated hollow 3D microdevices in practical biosystem
implementations, we prepared hollow 3D micropores with accurately
defined opening holes for the calibration-free resistive-pulse analysis
of nanoparticles.

Experimental Section
Materials
Substrates
for the loading of hollow 3D microstructure
devices, including an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated PET film (protective
film on both sides, Shenzhen Jemstone Technology Co., Ltd.) and ITO-coated
glass (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), were used as received. Milli-Q (Merck Millihole)
deionized (DI) H2O was used for the phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution preparation, nanoparticle dilution, and ultrasonic
treatment medium. A PBS tablet (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used for the
preparation of PBS solution, dissolved with DI water. Resist materials
for hollow 3D microstructure fabrication, including the IP-series
resist (IP-L, IP-S, and IP-Dip, Nanoscribe GmbH), ORMOCER (Micro Resist
Technology GmbH) and SU-8 (MicroChem Corp.), were used as received.
Different types of polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles functionalized with
carboxyl group, with a diameter size range from 114 to 530 nm, were
purchased from Bangs Laboratories, Inc. (see Figure S11). Raw PS nanoparticle samples were diluted with 1×
PBS solution, with a dilution ratio of 1:1000 to 1:10 000,
to prepare suitable nanoparticle solutions for resistive-pulse analysis.

Direct Laser Writing
Externally accessible hollow 3D
microstructures with built-in opening holes, including micropores,
microneedles, microelectrodes, microvalves, and micromachines, were
designed in an Autodesk AutoCAD program. These AutoCAD-generated standard
triangle language (.STL) files were imported into the DeScribe software
(Nanoscribe GmbH, Germany) for structural processing (slicing and
hatching). This processed general writing language (.GWL) file was
then transferred to the Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT system
(Nanoscribe GmbH, Germany. Figure S1) for
the DLW of hollow 3D microstructures. This TPP-enabled DLW fabrication
system was equipped with a FemtoFiber Pro NIR laser source (Toptica
Photonics AG) operating with a pulse duration (τ) ≈ 100
fs and a repetition rate (f) of 80 MHz at 780 nm
(λ). Transmittance (T) of laser beam through
the IP-S resist at 780 nm was ∼0.75. The laser pulse was focused
by a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 25× 0.8 NA oil DIC M27 objective,
with circular polarization at the entrance of the objective plane.
With the aid of an integrated charge-coupled device camera (Figure 1a), the DLW-TPP process
of hollow 3D microstructures can be visualized in real time (Video S1).

In the experiment, substrates
coated with resist materials were mounted onto the Nanoscribe-controlled
3D XYZ piezo stage for the DLW-TPP process. For the
hollow 3D microstructures fabricated with the IP-series resists (IP-L,
IP-S, and IP-Dip) and ORMOCER, the liquid resist materials (∼100
μL) were directly dropped onto the loading substrate to initiate
the DLW-TPP process. For the microfabrication using SU-8, prebaking
(60 °C, 60 s) was required before laser irradiation. After DLW
process, the SU-8-based structure was then processed with the post-exposure
baking (60 °C, 2 min), followed by a third photoresist baking
step (90 °C, 60 s) to harden the structure. Finally, these DLW-fabricated
3D microstructures were transferred into a corresponding development
system (mixed organic solvents, Table S2) for a specific period to remove the un-cross-linked resist materials
existing both inside and outside the hollow microstructures entirely.

Characterization
A JEOL IT-300 scanning electron microscope
( JEOL Ltd.) was used for the morphological characterization of these
prepared hollow 3D microstructures. The surfaces of these microstructures
analyzed by SEM were precoated with a 20 nm thick platinum film using
a JEOL coating system. A Nikon Eclipse Ni–U optical system
equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor lens was employed for the optical
imaging. Deposition of platinum films with different thicknesses (∼10–60
nm) on the surface of the resistive material was performed using the
metal coating system, by controlling the deposition time and input
current. Surface conductivity of the platinum-coated resist film was
measured using a Fluke Multimeter. The surface roughness of the prepared
hollow 3D micropore structures was measured and analyzed with the
Dektak 150 stylus profiler (Bruker Corp.). The mechanical properties
(Young’s modulus) of IP-S-based hollow microneedle structures
were measured by the Asylum Research MFP-3D-Bio inverted optical atomic
force microscope (Oxford Instruments), in an amplitude modulation–frequency
modulation viscoelastic mapping mode. Confocal characterization imaging
of the hollow 3D micropore structure was carried out by the confocal
laser scanning microscopy (LSM) suite-Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning
microscope (Leica AG). Ultrasonic treatment (∼10–30
s, Grant Instruments) was performed to release the hollow 3D microstructures
from the loading substrate.

Resistive-Pulse Analysis
The prepared
hollow 3D micropore
structure used for resistive-pulse analysis was loaded on the PET
substrate (∼1 cm × 1 cm). As shown in Figure S5, the substrate microhole (∼Ø 100 μm) fully covered by the upper DLW-TPP-prepared micropore
structure was created by our previously developed laser ablation technique
(Figure S5). The laser ablation process
details were described above. A qNano system (Izon Science, New Zealand)
was utilized for the resistive-pulse nanoparticle analysis. The micropore
sample was incorporated into the measurement chamber unit of qNano
(see Figure S6). PBS (1×, Sigma-Aldrich
Co.) was used as the electrolyte for resistive-pulse analysis. For
the study of the transient i–v curves of the hollow 3D micropore structures with a different-sized
circular opening hole (1–5 μm), corresponding ionic currents
were recorded at each applied voltage (−1.2 to 1.2 V, 0.6 V
increment for each step). For the resistive-pulse analysis of PS nanoparticles,
different types of nanoparticle (114–530 nm) solution samples
(∼40 μL) were added onto the upper chamber of the measurement
unit once the characterization system reached the stabilized states.
In the experiment, the current blockades were collectively recorded
and analyzed with the built-in qNano analysis.
