This study aims at investigating the distortion of poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) nanostructures
in a soft lithography demolding process using molecular dynamics simulation.
Experimental results show that after peeling, PDMS nanopillars became
10–60% longer in height than the mold size. Molecular dynamics
simulations have been employed to plot the stress–strain curve
of the nanopillars when subjected to uniaxial stress. Three force
fields (COMPASS, CVFF, and PCFF) were used for modeling. The demolding
process in soft lithography and nanoimprint lithography causes significant
deformation in replication. The experimental results show clear signs
of elongation after demolding. Molecular dynamics simulations are
employed to study the stress–strain relationship of the PDMS
nanopillars. The results from the simulation show that a PDMS nanopillar
at temperature T = 300 K under tensile stress shows
characteristics of flexible plastic under tensile stress and has a
lower Young’s modulus, ultimate tensile stress, and Poisson’s
ratio.

Introduction
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) was
first introduced by Chou et al.1 in 1995
and has shown promising potential to produce low-cost, high-resolution,
high-throughput continuous nanostructures. NIL uses the simple concept
of material displacement by mechanical contact as shown in Figure 1. This method enables
continuous pattern transfer from a mold to a target substrate. While
the concept is simple, many factors may cause distortion in the replications,
such as temperature, pressure, aspect ratio, peeling-off technique,
etc.2−6 Thus, when all distortion factors
are accumulated, it is key in the manufacturing process to understand
the stress and strain relationship of a substrate in the demolding process
(Figure 2).

Figure 1 Soft lithography uses in NIL: (A) imprint process; (B)
demolding process.

demolding.

Figures 3 and 4 show the experimental results for the fabricated mold dimension
and replication dimension, respectively. The experimental results
obtained show that the height of the PDMS replication increased 30–65%
from the depth obtained from the master mold. This information is
crucial for NIL, because the entire concept of NIL is to obtain exact
replica from continuous press and peel-off of mold to plastic. Figure 2 illustrates the
elongation of PDMS replica during the demolding process.

The
results from experiment set an objective for this study to investigate
the stress and strain relationship of PDMS nanostructures. However,
a major challenge for nanoscale materials is that there are no standardized
and well-assessed equipment or methodology for stress–strain
experimental studies.7 Although new tools
have been developed to study mechanical properties on the nanoscale
experimentally, the results are not always reliable.7−9 For example, the only experimental
data for Young’s Modulus of nanostructures are mostly derived
from the bending and nanoindentation test.7−9 A proper experimental data from uniaxial
tension cannot be obtained because of the limitation to obtain a completely
freestanding sample.

Hence, this study has employed the molecular
dynamics (MD) method to investigate the PDMS distortion nanostructure
in the demolding process. The MD method has helped engineers and scientists
in complex problems relating to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
research.10,11 In this study, MD was used to study the
stress–strain relationship of PDMS nanostructures when subject
to uniaxial stress.

Results and Discussion
The equilibrium process i.e.,
NVT and NPT, and loading simulations are conducted at a temperature
of 300 K and a pressure of 1 atm. While many studies of uniaxial loading
are at a temperature lower than room temperature,12,13 most
of the soft lithography and NIL processes are performed at room temperature
or higher.6,14,15 Thus, simulation
results show a significant thermal effect on the stress–strain
curve. A previous study has shown that the structure and dynamics
of PDMS at a temperature of 500K relaxed to 300 K is in the form of
melt although bulk PDMS is solid at a temperature of 300 K.16 The study shows the tremendous effects of heat
on a polymer at the nanoscale.16−18Combining a small strain rate and thermal effect, the result obtained
in this study shows that the PDMS nanostructure show noticeably ductile
material behavior.

Figure 5 shows the uniaxial deformation of PDMS at strains
of (a) 0.0, (b) 0.1, and (c) 0.3 via constant strain along the x-axis
in the periodic simulation cell. This study used a small strain rate, ε̇ = 0.01% fs–1, for the system
to relax at every timestep.19,20 This in return minimizes
crazing, which is typically observed in linear polymer glass at high
strain.21 However, it is important to note
that when a cavity is formed, it is impossible to relax and undo the
cavity while the system is under strain. Visual inspection show that
a cavity formed at a certain point for sufficiently high stress as
illustrated in Figure 5c. When cavity takes form, the strain energy relieved is balanced
by the surface energy of the newly generated surfaces.22 The study shows that when stress is applied
beyond the point of cavity formation, the polymer chain will become
elongated and ordered and eventually facilitate fibril formation.16

Figure 5 PDMS stretching at strains of (A) 0.0, (B) 0.1, and (C)
0.3.

The study found that cavity formation
is a highly localized process in which the monomer around the cavity
does not move very much.16 Our inspection
revealed that the cavity formed at certain points for the eight-monomer
series is about the same as that for the 12-monomer series. This is
because the cohesive energy, i.e., the nonbonded interaction of PDMS
for both series, is about the same. Cavity formation might differ
if the chain length was set to be longer as the influence of the chain
length has been proved to have a significant effect on mechanical
properties.23,24 A study by Lavine et al.25 showed that polyethylene with alkane chain C
> 100 has significant resistance to reorientation of the molecules
due to entanglement. For PDMS, the
alignment of the two CH3 groups is an important factor
for determining the entanglement length. Thus, varying the chain length
to longer series and studying the entanglement by looking at the isolated
chain might have proved important. Future work will include simulation
of PDMS under tension with a greater range of chain lengths.

Figures 6–8 show the stress–strain
behavior of the PDMS eight-series and 12-series monomer nanopillars
simulated at T = 300 K and ε̇ = 0.01%
fs–1, from the initial state to complete rupture.
Although the strain used is high, such a strain rate has been used
in impact-induced deformation.26 It is
noted that the strain used is not comparable to experimental observations
provided in the Introduction Section. The
observations were used as a lead in this study.

Figure 8 Stress–strain curve of PDMS with 8 and 12-chain
monomer using the polymer consistent force field (PCFF).

The force field
used in the simulation in Figures 6–8 is Condensed-phase
optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS)
force field,27 consistent valence force
field (CVFF),28,29 and polymer consistent force
field (PCFF),30 respectively. For bulk
PDMS, the normal stress–strain curve exhibits a general elastomer
pattern.31,32 However, for this study, the stress–strain
curve obtained exhibits a flexible plastic pattern with significant
yielding. This kind of behavior occurs in nanostructures under tension
due to the thermal effect as mentioned earlier.12,13,17,18,33 The extension of PDMS nanopillars started with elastic
deformation from its initial state to the first yielding represented
by the dot-dashed line in the graph. The results show that for all
force fields, the 12-monomer series has slightly higher stress for
any strain than the eight-monomer series. This result is expected
because longer chains have longer entanglement lengths. More energy
is also needed for longer polymer chains to elongate and reorder.34 In our result, the PDMS nanopillars ruptured
at strains of 0.8, 0.7, and 0.8 for COMPASS, CVFF, and PCFF, respectively.
This is slightly lower than bulk PDMS at a strain of 1.0.35 This is expected because thickness significantly
affects tensile strength.36

After
the stress–strain reaches the ultimate tensile stress, there
is a steady drop until rupture. This indicates structural changes
and atomic reconstructuring and reordering. Several studies reported
that when the polymer is under stress, the polymer chains will be
elongated and ordered and, subsequently, site nucleation and the growth
of the crystalline phase are observed.25,33,37,38 This might explain the
curve pattern after ultimate tensile stress, where small peaks are
observed before rupture. The processes of nanopillar elongation, reconstruction,
reordering, relaxation, and crystallization in a stepwise periodic
manner before rupture produce a jerky curve pattern, while that of
typical flexible plastic in bulk will show a smooth yielding curve.25,37,39

The study indicates that
the ultimate tensile stress for bulk PDMS ranges from 3.51 to 7.65
MPa.35 The ultimate tensile stress obtained
from simulation also 46.3% of the bulk value, as summarized in Table 1. A study has revealed
that elastic constant is less near the free surfaces compared to bulk
values.39,40 For the nanostructure where the ratio of
surface to volume is larger, the difference in mechanical strength
of the nanostructure to its bulk value can be significant. Several
factors contributed to this phenomenon, one of which is electron distribution.
At the surface, electron distribution density is less, thus providing
weaker bonding on the surface.41 Atoms
further away from the surface experienced a different local environment
compared to the atoms at the surface. However, for a nanostructure
with a high surface to volume ratio, the electron distribution density
is less throughout the structure. Furthermore, for a nanostructure
with a characteristic length on the nanoscale, surface stress can
displace atoms from their equilibrium positions, which are otherwise
occupied in bulk assemblies. These changes in interatomic ordering
can affect mechanical properties at the nanoscale.42 The Young’s Modulus, Ultimate Tensile Stress, and
Poisson’s Ratio are summarized in Table 1.

In Figure 9, it is noted that Young’s Modulus
obtained from the simulation was 67–71% of the Young’s
Modulus values found in bulk PDMS of 1.32 MPa.35 One of the main factors that contributed to the reduction
of simulated Young’s Modulus in the experiment is the thermal
effect at the nanoscale. A study revealed that simulation conducted
at low temperature i.e., T = 50 K has a larger Young‘s
Modulus than a simulation conducted at higher room temperatures of T = 300 K11. This is because at higher temperature,
atoms can absorb more energy, hence weakening the bonds between them
and resulting in less stiff nanowire. At low temperatures of T = 50 K, the thermal effect is negligible. A high strain
rate also can reduce stiffness by introducing disorder.43 However, for this study, the effect contributed
by a high strain rate is minimized due
to the low strain rate used, ε̇ = 0.01% fs–1. (Figures 10 and 11)

of °, 1000°, and 1000 Å in x, y, and z directions.

The Poisson’s ratio obtained from
simulation is about 46.3% of the bulk value, which is less than the
experimental bulk value of 0.4.35 When
strain is applied and coupled with the thermal effect, the disorders
within the nanostructure increase, hence increasing malleability and
compressibility. An increase in malleability makes the PDMS nanostructure
under uniaxial loading behave like a ductile structure, as indicated
by Poisson’s ratio. Similar trends were found when stanene
is subjected to uniaxial loading.13 A study
by Koh et al.12 compares the changes in
Poisson’s Ratio under the temperature effect, and the results
show that Poisson’s Ratio at T = 50 K is significantly
lower than Poisson’s Ratio at T = 300 K.

Conclusions
The demolding process in soft lithography
and nanoimprint lithography causes significant deformation on its
replicated nanostructures. Experimental observations show clear signs
of about 10–60% elongation on the replicated nanostructures
after the demolding process. Hence, molecular dynamics simulations
are employed to study the stress–strain relationship of the
replicated PDMS nanostructures. The results from MD simulations demonstrate
that the PDMS nanostructure at temperature T = 300
K under tensile stress shows characteristics of flexible plastic with
significant yielding instead of the general pattern curve for bulk
PDMS. Moreover, the PDMS nanostructure has a lower Young’s
Modulus, which are around 67–71% of the bulk value. The Ultimate
Tensile Stress for PDMS nanostructures is also about 46.3% of the
bulk value and Poisson’s Ratio is about 48.0% as compared to
the bulk value. This is due to the thermal effect, large surface to
volume ratio, and characteristic length at the nanoscale. The results
from this work have potential to be used as a guide for the nanofabrication/
NIL process.

Materials and Methods
The mold used a positive electron
beam resist poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) of 150 nm thickness spin-coated
on a silicon substrate at 4000 rpm for 60 s. After that, the substrates
were baked in an oven at a temperature of 185 °C for 30 min.
The pattern was designed using Raith software and then exported to
a Raith system in GDSII file format. Exposure of the nanosquare array
was performed using a Raith ELPHY Quantum Plus EBL system integrated
with a JOEL Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) model JSM 6460LV at
an acceleration voltage of 30 keV. The area dosage was fixed at 500
μC
cm–2, while the beam current was fixed at 0.02 nA.
After EBL exposure, the exposed PMMA samples were developed in a mixture
solution of methylisobuthyketone (MIBK) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
with a proportion of 1:3 for 40 s, rinsed in IPA for 20 s, and dried
by nitrogen gas. The pattern profile was then observed using an Atomic
Force Microscope (AFM). The replication used the patterns defined
in the PMMA resist without any further pattern transfer to minimize
error. For the replica molding process, a PDMS prepolymer was degassed
in a vacuum chamber and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 40 s on a nanopatterned
PMMA mold to produce a thin film of PDMS. The thin film of PDMS on
the PMMA mold was degassed for the second time to assist the liquid
mixture to fill into the cavities of the master mold before pouring
the PDMS mixture until 2 mm of PDMS thickness was achieved. The PDMS
mixture on the master mold was cured in the oven at 50 °C for
6 h. After the curing process, the crosslinked PDMS film was carefully
peeled off from the PMMA mold. The pattern profile was then observed
using an AFM.

The MD method used is a deterministic approach
to calculate the dynamics trajectories of molecules, atoms, or ions.
In general, the MD method can be divided into three stages. The first
stage is to build the initial and boundary conditions. This includes
the initial position, external forces, and interaction potential between
particles. For this study, the monomers used are a series of PDMS
chains of eight and 12. The packing and initial position were done
using PACKMOL.44 The dimension of the PDMS
substrate is 1000°, 1000°, and 1000 Å in the x, y, and z directions. The total number
of atoms in the eight-series monomers is 1.21 × 106 atoms, with 1 200 000 bonds, 2 268 000
angles, 28 008 000 dihedrals, and 1 440 000
improper interactions. For 12-series monomers, the total number of
atoms is 1.45 × 106 atoms, with 1 439 997
bonds, 2 723 991 angles, 3 383 991 dihedrals,
and 1 727 991 improper interactions. In this stage,
the substrate is minimized and equilibrated at temperature T = 300 K. In the second stage, the new positions and velocities
of atoms were calculated and updated using the Newtonian equation
of motion for every 0.01 fs. Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively
Parallel Simulator, LAMMPS,45 is used as
the main software to run the simulation. The simulation cell is deformed
in the x-direction at a strain
rate of 1.011 s–1.
