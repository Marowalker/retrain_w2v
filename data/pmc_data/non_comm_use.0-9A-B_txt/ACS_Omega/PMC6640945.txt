Long-range
olefin isomerization of 2-alkenylbenzoic acid derivatives
going through two to five sp3-carbon atoms to give (E)-alkenes was achieved with palladium(0) nanoparticles.
The substrate scope of this reaction includes carboxylic acid, ester,
and primary to tertiary amides and tolerates various substituents
on the benzene ring. This isomerization reaction was catalyzed by
recyclable Pd(0) nanoparticles, prepared in situ from PdCl2 and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron
microscopy analyses. 1H NMR studies and kinetic modeling
supported a stepwise process. This new process was applied to synthesize
a natural dihydroisocoumarin with good efficiency.

Introduction
Synthesis
and manipulation of alkenes are essential in organic
chemistry and the chemical industry.1 Although
many methods have been developed to prepare olefins via the interchange
of various functional groups, the isomerization of readily available
olefins could be one of the most atom-economical ways to access compounds
having a carbon–carbon double bond at the desired position.2 For example, metal-catalyzed alkene isomerization
is a powerful chemical transformation that provides a [1,3]-hydrogen
shift, not easily viable by other techniques.3 The one-carbon migration or one-position shift of such double bonds,
that is, allylbenzene to 1-propenylbenzene, has been reported with
a wide array of metal complexes or bases and applied to the synthesis
of natural products.4 In contrast, the
potential to isomerize olefins through two or more carbon atoms/positions
under mild reaction conditions has seldom been explored.3a,5 Recently, Mazet’s group cleverly demonstrated the potential
of long-range olefin isomerization in preparing highly functionalized
molecules.6

Herein, we report that
nanoscale palladium(0) prepared in situ
catalyzes the isomerization of 2-alkenylbenzoic acid derivatives to
the corresponding vinyl-conjugated products, in which olefin migration
over up to five carbon atoms was achieved under very mild reaction
conditions (Scheme 1). Palladium nanoparticles, as heterogeneous catalysts, have been
widely applied for various cross-coupling and hydrogenation reactions;7 however, few reports describe their role in isomerization
reactions and the reported processes were often limited to a one-carbon
migration of allylic substrates.8 In this
work, we demonstrate that isomerization of more than one carbon atom
of olefins could be also practical, as shown in our synthesis of a
natural isocoumarin.

Scheme 1 Isomerization of 2-Alkenylbenzoic Acid Derivatives
Results and Discussion
As palladium and its metal complexes have been widely applied for
olefin isomerization reactions,3−5,9 we
screened readily available palladium compounds for the isomerization
of 2-(3-butenyl)benzoic acid10 (1a) to 2-(1-butenyl)benzoic acid11 (1b). The results are summarized in Table 1. Initially, a reaction mixture of 1a and 10 mol % PdCl2 was stirred in 1,2-dichloroethane
at 50 °C for 5 h, and the oxidized product, 3-ethyl-1H-isochromen-1-one (1c), was obtained in 57%
yield (entry 1). Oxidation of the desired product, 1b, to 1c via the Wacker process catalyzed by Pd(II) was
reported.12 Thus, we conducted the reaction
under an atmosphere of nitrogen and lowered the reaction temperature
to 25 °C. To our delight, the isomerized product, 1b, was isolated in 92% yield (entry 2). The 1H NMR spectrum
of the product was consistent with the reported data for 1b and indicated that the E-isomer dominated (>20:1; the coupling
constant
between the two vinylic hydrogens of 1b, 15.6 Hz, was
observed and consistent with the reported value).11 Using PdCl2 of a higher purity (99.999%) gave
a comparable yield of 1b (entry 3), a result that should
exclude this reaction as being catalyzed by trace amounts of impurities.
The yield remained the same when 5 mol % PdCl2 was applied
(entry 4); however, further reducing the amount of PdCl2 led to poor conversion (entry 6). The variation in the yield was
negligible as we increased the reaction scale (1.0 mmol of 1a, entry 5). Bis(acetonitrile)palladium dichloride afforded a slightly
lower yield (entry 7). No conversion was observed when palladium(II)
acetate, palladium on activated charcoal with or without a chloride
ion, PdCl2(PPh3)2, or Pd2(dba)3 was used (entries 8–12). The results suggested
that this reaction does not require ligands, which are often employed
in homogeneous catalysis.

The reaction is not restricted to 2-alkenylbenzoic acids like 1a but also works with a number of substrates, bearing various
substituents on the benzene moiety. Table 2 summarizes the results of isomerization
of substituted 2-(3-butenyl)benzoic acids, prepared by the allylation
of various o-toluic acids or esters (2a–15a, Scheme 2). All methyl-substituted substrates, 2a–5a, provided good yields of the isomerized products, 2b–5b (entries 1–4), regardless
of the positions of the substituents. Benzoic acids 6a–9a, bearing fluorine or chlorine at the 4- or
5-position, were also compatible with this process (entries 5–8),
although better yields were obtained with chloro-substituted benzoic
acids 8a and 9a. The 3-methoxy compound, 10a, gave a poor conversion (30%, entry 9), but good yields
were achieved for the substrates with a 4- or 6-methoxy group (entries
10 and 11). No conversion was observed for the 3-nitrobenzoic acid, 13a (entry 12). The β-resorcylic acid derivative, 14a, did not afford the isomerized product, 14b, but the isomerization succeeded well when the corresponding diacetate, 15a, was subjected to the reaction (entry 14).

Results of studies on the isomerization
of double bonds more distant
from the benzene ring are provided in Table 3. Under the same reaction conditions used
for the substrates in Table 2, 2-(4-pentenyl)benzoic acid (16a) was isomerized
to (E)-2-(1-pentenyl)benzoic acid (16b) in 85% isolated yield (entry 1).13 Good-to-reasonable
yields were obtained for the isomerization of 2-(5-hexenyl)benzoic
acid (17a) and 2-(6-heptenyl)benzoic acid (18a, entries 2 and 3), in which the olefin migrations go through four
and five sp3-carbon atoms, respectively. Poor conversion
was observed when the migration further extended to six carbons (19a, entry 4). The comparable yields of 16b resulting
for terminal and internal olefins 16a and 20a (entries 1 and 5, respectively) suggest that 20a could
be the intermediate for the isomerization of 16a to 16b and that isomerization is a multiple-step process (vide
infra). 1,1-Disubstituted and trisubstituted olefins (21a and 22a), which are thermodynamically more stable compared
with terminal alkenes,14 failed to give
the corresponding conjugated products under standard conditions. Like
the result obtained for 14a, compound 23a, in which the hydroxyl group is on the alkenyl chain, was not a
good substrate for the isomerization process (entry 8). However, the
reaction proceeded
when the hydroxyl group was protected as that in ethoxymethyl ether 24a and the reaction temperature was increased (entry 9).
The strong influence of the hydroxyl group in this isomerization reaction
prompted us to screen other substrates bearing functional groups with
a high haptophilicity/anchoring effect.15 Indeed, the isomerization of a primary amide, 2-(3-butenyl)benzamide
(25a), proceeded well at a higher reaction temperature
(40 °C, entry 10). The corresponding reaction of secondary amide 26a was also feasible (entry 11). Although the olefin isomerizations
of tertiary amide 27a and methyl ester 28a were sluggish under the standard conditions, both reactions advanced
in refluxing isopropyl alcohol (entries 12 and 13). This protic solvent compensates
for the carbonyl compounds’ lack of labile protons, such as
esters and tertiary amides, promoting isomerization. These results
broaden the scope of this process and substantially increase its potential
in future applications. However, the yields of this isomerization
reaction derived from nitrile 29a, 4-(3-butenyl)benzoic
acid 30a,16 and (3-butenyl)benzene 31a(17) were low (entries 14–16),
which suggests that the presence of the carboxyl group and its position
relative to that of the alkenyl group are important for the isomerization
reaction to occur.

To further define the mechanism of the reaction, the
progress of
the isomerization of 1a to 1b was monitored
by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1), by which the reaction intermediate was
recorded and identified as 2-(2-butenyl)benzoic acid (1i).12 The plot of the concentrations of 1a, intermediate 1i, and 1b versus
time is shown in Figure 2 and is consistent with a consecutive, stepwise reaction process
for the isomerization (Scheme 3). Modeling the observed concentration changes versus time
according to the kinetic reaction rate equations (Supporting Information) based on Scheme 3 provided reasonably good correlation coefficients,
in support of this tentative mechanism. The two rate constants, k1 and k2, obtained
in the modeling study are 1.3 × 10–4 and 6.0
× 10–5 (M/s), respectively. Further studies
are required to gain more insight into the reaction intermediate or
mechanism.4a

Scheme 3 Sequential Isomerization of 1a
The NMR studies revealed that the reaction was
static during the
first 30 min (Figure 2). This indicates that an incubation time is required to generate
the active catalyst for the isomerization. This conjecture is supported
by the observed color change in the reaction suspension as the reaction
proceeded (Figure 3a), which became evident after 25 min of stirring at 25 °C;
the light-brown color was persistent throughout the reaction. At different
reaction-time intervals, the suspensions were centrifuged to separate
the solid residues from the organic solution. The former were then
washed with CH2Cl2, collected, and subjected
to analysis by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Figure 3b) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Figure 3b, insets). The XRD
spectra clearly indicated the disappearance of PdCl2 and
the formation of Pd(0) as the reaction proceeded.18 Here, a small portion of compound 1a should
be the reducing agent for the reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) and oxidized
to 1c. The formation of Pd(0) nanoparticles by the in
situ reduction of Pd(II) with ethylene or vinyl compounds and their
applications have been reported.19 The
SEM images also revealed changes in the morphology of the palladium,
which gradually transformed from micrometer-scaled metal salts into
nanometer-sized metal rods. The average size of the generated Pd(0)
nanoparticles is 656 ± 176 nm, and a plot of their size distribution
is shown in the Supporting Information.

To test Pd(0) as the active catalyst for the reaction, the
recyclability
of the dark-colored palladium particles generated was examined next.
Under an atmosphere of nitrogen, the palladium particles were separated
out of the reaction mixture by centrifugation, washed with CH2Cl2, and supplemented with a new portion of 1a in CH2Cl2 for another cycle of isomerization.
The yields of 1b obtained from each cycle are summarized
in Table 4. When the
reactions were carried out under standard conditions, with 5 or 10
mol % of PdCl2 and stirring at 25 °C for 5 h in CH2Cl2, three cycles of the isomerization reaction
were achieved (trials 1 and 2). On increasing the catalyst loading
to 20 mol % and reducing the reaction time to 2 h for each cycle,
the catalyst remained active in cycle 4. The results showed that the
Pd(0) catalyst was recyclable. The gradual inactiveness of the palladium
particles should be due to the loss of active, accessible metal surface
area or agglomeration of Pd nanoparticles.20

2-Allyl benzoic
acid 32a(21) and 1a were utilized to show the activity differences
between several Pd(0) catalysts, that is, commercial Pd black, the
synthesized Pd(0) nanoparticles (20 nm, Supporting Information),22 and those prepared
in situ from PdCl2 (Table 5). For the isomerization reaction of 32a to 32b, both synthesized and in situ prepared Pd(0)
nanoparticles gave comparable, good yields, which were significantly
better than those on using commercial Pd black (entries 1–3)
as the catalyst. However, only the in situ prepared Pd catalyst was
effective in isomerizing the olefin of 1a (entry 4),
which went through two sp3 carbons to yield 1b. The lower reactivity of the synthesized Pd(0) nanoparticles could
be explained by the inevitable deactivation during the preparation,
same as the decay of the in situ prepared Pd catalyst in the above
recycle study.

We applied the
Pd-catalyzed isomerization reaction to synthesize
dihydroisocoumarin 33, a natural product isolated from
brown alga Caulocystis cephalornithos that showed anti-inflammatory activity (Scheme 4).23 Starting
with commercially available 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid (34), substrate 36 was prepared after protection
of the hydroxyl group and allylation with (E)-1-bromododec-2-ene.24 The reaction of 36 and PdCl2 in methanol afforded oxidized isocoumarin 38 in 98% yield, which should be derived from isomerized intermediate 37 undergoing spontaneous oxidative cyclization.12 Hydrogenation of 35 with Pd/C gave
the target dihydroisocoumarin, 33, in 73% yield. The
final two steps could be performed in a one-pot procedure by introducing
hydrogen gas into the reaction vessel after the cyclization. This
synthesis is short and free from metal-catalyzed C—C bond formations,
such as Suzuki–Miyaura and Heck cross couplings, which are
highly exploited in the syntheses of isocoumarin- or coumarin-type
molecules.25

Dihydroisocoumarin 33
Conclusions
In summary, a palladium catalyst generated
in situ effectively
isomerizes homobenzylic or more distant primary olefins into the internal E-olefins, conjugated with the aromatic system of benzoic
acid derivatives. NMR spectrometry observed 2-(2-butenyl)benzoic acid
(1i) as the reaction intermediate and the kinetic study
suggested a stepwise, multistep process for the isomerization. The
reaction conditions are mild and easy to execute, and the Pd(0) catalyst
is recyclable. This new reaction provides an alternative method for
preparing alkenyl substituted aromatic carboxylic acids and their
derivatives.

Experimental Section
All reactions
involving air- or moisture-sensitive reagents or
intermediates were performed under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen
in oven-dried glassware. Palladium black (98% Pd, surface area 28–33
m2/g), other reagents, and solvents were obtained from
commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless
mentioned otherwise. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether were
dried over sodium, monitored with benzophenone ketyl radicals, and
distilled prior to use. Dichloromethane and toluene were dried over
CaH2 and distilled prior to use. Thin-layer chromatography
was performed using precoated silica gel 60 F254 plates containing
a fluorescent indicator; purification by chromatography was done using
silica gel (230–400 mesh). 1H and 13C
chemical shifts are reported in parts per million and referenced to
residual solvent. All spectra were obtained at 25 °C.

Compounds 1a,1016a,1317a,1318a,1319a,1330a,1631a,17 and 32a(21) were prepared according to
the literature procedures.

XRD patterns were measured on a Burker
D8 Advance diffractometer
using a Cu Kα source (1.5406 Å). SEM and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy were performed using a JEOL JSM-7000F SEM system
utilizing an accelerating voltage of 15 keV.
