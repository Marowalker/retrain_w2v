Detachment behavior of single glass particle
with the same mass but different shapes from an oscillation bubble
driven by the ultrasound energy was investigated. The maximum acceleration
of particle motion was calculated based on the oscillation of the
bubble bottom point. The maximum acceleration increases with the increasing
ultrasonic amplitude. Curved (cylindrical and sphere) particles attach
onto the bubble mostly by the curved surface, while noncurved (cube
and triangular prism) particles attach onto the bubble mostly by the
plane surface. The detachment of noncurved particles requires a larger
ultrasonic amplitude than that of the curved particles, whereas a
larger ultrasonic amplitude means a larger driving force for the oscillation
of the bubble. The detachment force of noncurved particles from the
bubble is higher than that of curved particles because of the presence
of larger contact areas between noncurved particles and the bubble
as well as the sharp edge of noncurved particles, which provides the
stable attachment.

1 Introduction
Flotation is a method for upgrading
the fine ore and plays an important role in mineral processing. The
capture of mineral particles by rising bubbles is a prerequisite for
the flotation process. Moreover, the stability of bubble-particle
aggregates also plays a significant role in the flotation efficiency.
Flotation is a complex process and affected by many parameters.1 The properties of floating particles, flotation
devices, and work conditions are the main factors affecting flotation
efficiency. The surface morphology of particles, including the size,
shape, roughness, crystal structure, and functional group, is the
essence to determine its floatability. Several studies have reported
that the particle shape characteristic of various minerals plays an
important role in the flotation process (Table 1). In general, sharp edges contribute to
the quick thinning and rupturing of the water film between the particle
and bubble.2 Therefore, mineral particles
with irregular shapes generally have higher flotation recovery and
flotation rates in comparison with regularly shaped particles. It
is noted that most ground or crushed minerals are irregular particles.
It is challenging to investigate the influence of particle shape on
flotation independently because of the angular shapes and roughness
of irregular particles. It is vital to investigate the effect of regular-shaped
particles, such as sphere, quadrate, ellipse, triangle, and others
on the flotation, especially for the ideal attachment and detachment
between the regular shaped particle and the bubble.3 Szczerkowska4 used regular-shaped
particles (circular, equilateral triangular, and square platelets),
which were stamped from the 1 mm thick polystyrene sheet, to study
the influence of particle shape on the flotation. It was found that
the flotation kinetics was the slowest for circular platelets.

Coarse particles usually have high collision efficiency in the flotation.
However, the flotation recovery of coarse particles is poor, which
is mainly caused by the easier detachment of coarse particles from
bubbles.16−18 Therefore,
the detachment is important in mineral flotation, especially for the
flotation of coarse particles. After the collision and attachment,
the bubble-particle aggregate is formed. Yoon and Mao19 pointed out that the particle detached from the bubble
when the kinetic energy is larger than the work of adhesion and the
energy barrier. Goel20 observed the behavior
of particle-laden bubbles in the turbulent shear flow near a rotating
impeller in a flotation cell. The results showed that fractional detachment
of particles was related to the mechanical energy dissipation rate
in the region of the impeller. In the flotation process, the attachment
force, including the capillary force, buoyancy force of the particle,
and pressure force on the particle, maintains the stability of bubble-particle
aggregates. The detaching force, including the weight of particle
and external force, tends to detach the particle from the bubble surface.21 The ratio of inertial force to the capillary
force was expressed as the Bond number (Bo) to evaluate
the stability of bubble particle aggregates, which was only used to
describe the two-phase system. The modified Bond number (Bo*) proposed by Schulze, the ratio of the magnitude of all the detaching
force to all of the attaching force, to commonly describe the stability
of bubble-particle aggregates in the multiphase flotation system.22 If Bo* > 1, the particle
will detach from the bubble surface. Otherwise, if Bo* < 1, the bubble-particle aggregate will remain stable.

The detachment of particles forming bubbles in a turbulent vortex
was observed by Wang.23 The bubble-particle
aggregate was forced to make a centrifugal movement. When the radial
centripetal force induced by the rotation is sufficiently high, the
particle detached from the bubble surface. Oscillation of bubble-particle
aggregate caused by acoustic vibration was studied by Holtham and
Cheng.24 They found that the amplitude
of oscillations played a vital role in the detachment. The detachment
of coarse particles from oscillating bubbles was studied by Xu12 and Awatey.25 The
detachment force is mainly determined by the dynamic contact angle.
The larger detachment forces were observed for the irregular quartz
particles compared to that of the spherical glass beads. This method
assumed that the movement of the bubble was the same as that of the
loudspeaker. However, the deformation and the elasticity of the bubble
should also be considered. In our previous work, the projected area
of a fixed unloaded bubble under ultrasonic treatment is similar to
a harmonic wave. The irregular glass fragments have a larger bubble-particle
attachment angle and higher cumulative flotation recovery than that
of spherical glass beads.

In this study, to investigate the
detachment of a single regular-shaped particle from the bubble, regular-shaped
glass particles (cube, triangular prism, cylindrical, and sphere)
were designed and manufactured. Moreover, combined with the ultrasonic
treatment, the effect of particle shape on the detachment behavior
of a single glass particle under ultrasound-assisted oscillation forces
was investigated.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Movement
of Bubble Bottom under Ultrasonic-Assisted Treatment
Ultrasonic
waves are longitudinal waves and rely on the vibration of the surrounding
medium to propagate. In the water cell, the bubble is treated by the
vibration of the surrounding water to oscillate. The single particle
attaches onto the bubble bottom and moves with the bubble bottom.
Therefore, the motion of the bubble bottom point is chosen to analyze
first. The outline profile of the bubble is determined by the built-in
Canny edge detection method supported by the edge function in the
Image Analysis Toolbox of MATLAB software. As shown in Figure 1, the motion of the bubble
bottom point could be described as a simple harmonic motion under
ultrasound-assisted treatment. Furthermore, the larger oscillation
amplitude of the bubble bottom point was obtained under the larger
amplitude of ultrasound. The motion results of the bubble bottom point
were fitted by MATLAB software and given by eq 1. There are some clear asymmetry parts in
the motion of the bubble bottom. This asymmetry is the response of
an anchored bubble where the effect of the needle will always be there.
Therefore, the determination coefficient (R2) of fit all was more than 0.80, which was acceptable. 1  where the A is the oscillation amplitude of the
bubble bottom, ω is the angular frequency, ω is the time,
and δ is the phase of the oscillation.

bottom point with different ultrasonic amplitudes (a), ultrasonic
amplitude of 22.8 μm; (b) ultrasonic amplitude of 34.2 μm;
(c) ultrasonic amplitude of 45.6 μm; (d) ultrasonic amplitude
of 57.0 μm; (e) ultrasonic amplitude of 68.4 μm).

The calculated
results of eq 1 are shown
in Table 2. The oscillation
amplitude (A) of the bubble bottom increased significantly
with the increasing ultrasonic amplitude. Besides, oscillation frequency
(f = ω/2π) and angular frequency (ω)
were maintained at a particular value accompanied by some fluctuations.
The fluctuations of bubble oscillation frequency occurred at a constant
ultrasonic frequency of 20 kHz because of the effect of the needle
on the anchored bubble.

The acceleration of oscillation and
the maximum acceleration of oscillation could be described by eqs 2 and 3, respectively. 2   3  

Figure 2 illustrates
the maximum acceleration of the oscillation of the bubble bottom point
under different ultrasonic amplitudes. The maximum acceleration of
oscillation increased with the increasing ultrasonic amplitude. Moreover,
there was a linear relationship between maximum acceleration and ultrasonic
amplitude. In addition, when the ultrasonic amplitude was beyond 68.4
μm, the bubble would collapse because of excessive oscillation
intensity. In general, a larger ultrasonic amplitude means a larger
driving force for the oscillation of the bubble.

acceleration of oscillation of bubble bottom under different ultrasonic
amplitudes.

2.2 Detachment Behavior of the Single
Particle from the Bubble
As can be seen from Figure 3, the contact line and area
between the bubble and single particle with different shapes could
be obtained (only the representative pictures were shown). The contact
line of the cube, triangular prism, and the cylindrical particle is
larger than that of the sphere particle. Besides, the side surface
of the cylindrical is curved. Therefore, compare with the plane surfaces
of the cube and triangular prism particle, the contact area of the
cylindrical particle is also relatively smaller.

Figure 3 Images of contact line between the bubble and
particle.

Typical images
are chosen in Figure 4 to illustrate the behavior of differently shaped particles detaching
from a fixed bubble. In the beginning, the contact area of the bubble
and the particle is mainly the plane surface or the curved surface
of the particle. The addition of the ultrasound-assisted treatment
drives the partly plane surface or the curved surface of the particle
away from the bubble. With the more surface of particle detaching
from the bubble, the contact area between the bubble and particle
changed from the plane surface to the edge or vertex of particle.
After this, the particle detaches from the bubble surface easily.
Therefore, the energy and force driving the particle bubble contacting
surface becoming zero is the energy barrier of bubble-particle detachment.

Figure 4 Detachment
behavior of the particle from the bubble.

2.3 Required Ultrasonic
Amplitude for Glass Particle Detachment
Figure 5 illustrates the results of
the required ultrasonic amplitude for glass-particle detachment with
or without the addition of the collector. As shown in Figure 5a, without the addition of
the collector, the average required ultrasonic amplitude of cube and
triangular prism particles was 35.3 and 30.8 μm, respectively.
However, the possibility of cylindrical and sphere particles detaching
from the bubble under 22.8 μm ultrasonic amplitude was 100%,
which indicated that the required detachment force of cylindrical
and sphere particles from the bubble surface was smaller than that
of cube and triangular prism particles. Therefore, the average required
ultrasonic amplitude of cylindrical and sphere particles was considered
as 22.8 μm.

Figure 5 Required ultrasonic
amplitude
for detachment of particle from the bubble surface.

The addition of the collector improved the
floatability of the glass particles, increasing the bubble-particle
attachment strength. Figure 5b,c indicates that the required ultrasonic amplitude for the
detachment of particles from the bubble surface increased with the
increasing usage of the collector.

In the presence of 10–5 mol/L DAH, the average required ultrasonic amplitude
for detachment of cube and triangular prism particles was 49.0 and
39.9 μm, respectively. Moreover, the average required ultrasonic
amplitude for detachment of cube and triangular prism particles increased
by 14.7 and 9.1 μm, respectively, compared with that without
the collector. However, the average required ultrasonic amplitude
for detachment of cylindrical and sphere particles was still not larger
than 22.8 μm. Compare with cylindrical and sphere particles,
cube and triangular prism particles have a larger contact surface
area. On the one hand, the larger contact surface area of cube and
triangular prism particles could enhance the attachment strength.
On the other hand, the broader contact surface area could adsorb more
collector agents, which was beneficial for the improvement of the
particle floatability and attachment force.

In the presence
of 10–4 mol/L DAH, all the average required ultrasonic
amplitude for detachment of glass particles with differently shaped
particles increased obviously. In addition, the detachment of cube
and triangular prism particles still required a larger ultrasonic
amplitude than that of cylindrical and sphere particles. However,
it is noted that the gap of the required ultrasonic amplitude for
detachment between glass particles with different shapes became small.
It means that the average required ultrasonic amplitude for detachment
of glass sphere and cylindrical particles seems close to that of cube
and triangular prism particles at a higher collector dosage.

If it is assumed that the moving of single particle attached to the
bubble bottom follows the moving of bubble bottom point, the maximum
detachment force of the single particle may be calculated by eq 4(12) 4  where Fv,max is the maximum force acting
on the particle when the particle follows the bottom of the bubble
(Fv,max = mamax), and Fg′ is the particle immersed weight (Fg′ = v(ρp – ρl)g).

The detachment force of particle under ultrasonic-assisted
treatment is presented in Figure 6. Because particles with different shapes have the
same mass, the detachment force presented a similar trend with the
required ultrasonic amplitude. The detachment force of the noncurved
particles (cube and triangular prism particle) was larger than that
of curved particles (sphere and cylindrical particle), which was constant
with the results of Xu.12 With the addition
of 10–5 mol/L DAH, the detachment force of noncurved
particles increased obviously, while the detachment force of curved
particles was still unchanged, which is because of the limit of the
ultrasonic amplitude. With more addition of collector, the floatability
of all glass particles was improved significantly. Therefore, the
detachment force of all shaped particles increased. The detachment
force of sphere and cylindrical particles increased significantly,
and the gap of the detachment force between curved particles and noncurved
particles became small. The larger dosage
of the collector weakened the role of the shape in the floatability,
which was consistent with the results of Xia13 that the effect of particle shape on the bubble-particle attachment
angle and flotation recovery.

Figure 6 Detachment
force of particle under ultrasonic treatment.

As shown in Figure 4, noncurved particles (cube and triangular
prism particle) attached to the bubble at the edge of the particle
surface. During the oscillation of bubble-particle aggregate, the
three-phase contact line was significantly pinned at the edge of the
noncurved particle surface. Also, the contact angle varied within
a certain range because of the contact angle hysteresis. The detachment
of the particle from the bubble surface is like that the detachment
of the particle from the air–water interface (the size of the
bubble is considered infinite).17 When
a particle is pulled away from the air–water interface by the
disruptive force, the capillary force is considered critical to supporting
the particle at the air–water interface. In addition, the capillary
force depends on the surface tension force and contact angle.26 The pining of the contact line, the contact
line fixes at the edge of the particle surface, leads to an increase
in contact angle compared with the static contact angle and an increase
in the capillary force correspondingly. Therefore, the particle with
a sharp edge requires a larger force than that with rounded cross-sections,
when the particle detaches from the air–water interface.27,28 Similarly, the pining performance also occurs in the edge of the
noncurved particle surface when particle detaches from the bubble
in the water. Compared with curved particles (cylindrical and sphere
particle), noncurved particles required a larger detachment force.
These results are constant with the results of the detachment of the
particle at the air–water interface.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Minerals
In order to
study the detachment behavior of the regular-shaped particle, the
cube, triangular prism, and cylindrical particles with the same mass
of 0.5 mm glass bead were chosen as the samples. The cube, triangular
prism, and cylindrical particles were cut out from a 0.4 mm thick
glass plate. The model of shaped glass particles is shown in Figure 7, and the size and
shape factors of investigated glass particles are listed in Table 3. The volume and mass
of shaped particles are the same, while the surface area, edge length,
and the number of vertex of particles are different. The surface area
and edge length of noncurved particles (cube and triangular prism
particle) are larger than that of curved particles (cylindrical and
sphere particle). In addition, there is no vertex on the curved particles,
while several vertexes exist on the noncurved particles.

3.2 Bubble-Particle Detachment Tests
Figure 8 illustrates
an experimental apparatus for studying the bubble-particle detachment
behavior under ultrasound-assisted treatment. A high-speed camera
and a computer in the experiment were used to record the detachment
behavior. The water cell was made of polymethyl methacrylate and separated
into right and left water cells by a removable plate. An ultrasound
probe was fixed in the right water cell to create the ultrasonic wave.
The syringe and the needle capillary (internal diameter 2 mm) were
fixed in the left water cell to produce a fixed bubble. The horizontal
distance between the ultrasound probe and the bubble was about 50
mm.

Figure 8 Design of experimental apparatus for observing
bubble
particle detachment.

In this study, the detachment behavior of bubble and single
particle with different shapes was investigated. First, a fixed bubble
was generated by the syringe in the left water cell with de-ionized
water at a pH of 10. Second, a glass particle was put on the upper
part of the bubble by the thin-tipped tweezers. The particle slid
to the bottom of the bubble and attached onto the bubble. After the
preattachment process, the ultrasound probe was turned on and lasted
for 3 s to drive the bubble-particle aggregate to oscillate. The bubble-particle
aggregate was affected by ultrasound-assisted treatment and would
tend to detachment. If the bubble-particle detachment behavior did
not happen, the ultrasound probe was turned on again with a larger
ultrasonic amplitude. During each ultrasound-assisted treatment, the
behavior of bubble-particle aggregate was recorded by the high-speed
camera with the frame rate of 4000 frames/s. Besides, the detachment
test of each kind of shape particle was conducted five times. The
required ultrasonic amplitude for the detachment of the particle from
the bubble surface was the average value of five tests.

The
frequency of the ultrasound probe used in this study (VCX800, SONICS)
is 20 kHz, and the smallest ultrasonic amplitude of the ultrasound
probe is 22.8 μm.

4 Conclusions
This paper observed the unloaded bubble
oscillation and the detachment behavior of single glass particle with
different shapes under ultrasound-assisted treatment. The motion of
the bubble bottom point could be described as a simple harmonic motion.
With an increase in ultrasonic amplitude, the oscillation amplitude
(A) of the bubble bottom point increased. Curved
particles attached onto the bubble mainly by the curved surface while
noncurved solids attached onto the bubble mainly by the plane surface.
Because of the larger contact area and presence of the sharp edge
of the particle, the detachment of noncurved particle required a larger
amplitude of ultrasound than that of the curved particle. In other
words, the detachment of noncurved particles from the bubble required
a relatively larger detachment force. In addition, the more addition
of collector weakened the role of the shape in the floatability of
particles.
