The intensity ratio
between the first (373 nm) and the third (383
nm) vibronic peaks [I1/I3, as the pyrene (Py) scale] of fluorescent Py was used
to monitor the critical concentration, drug-loading, and -releasing
behaviors of a Py-terminated, amphiphilic polypeptide PPM and its
hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complex (HIPC) with poly(acrylic acid)
(PAA). Primarily, an amphiphilic PPM with a hydrophobic Py terminal
and hydrophilic methoxy-bis(ethylene oxide) pendant groups was synthesized
through multiple preparative steps, and the resultant PPM was thoroughly
mixed with PAA through a preferable hydrogen bond (H bond) interaction
to form HIPC. The emission study suggested that the I1/I3 ratio and the quantum
yield (ΦF) are effective in determining the critical
concentrations of the aqueous PPM and PPM/PAA solutions. Moreover,
the I1/I3 ratio
and ΦF were found to be convenient measures for determining
the amounts of doxorubicin drugs loaded by and released from the aqueous
PPM and PPM/PAA solutions.

Introduction
Stimuli-responsive
polymers have received considerable attention
with regard to their potential applications in the biomedical field
in the past few decades.1−3 The stimuli include temperature,
light, electric fields, pH, and so on, which can be applied in many
biomedical applications, such as the delivery systems of smart drugs
and genes, tissue engineering scaffolds, and biological separation.4−12 For synthetic materials applied in the field of drug delivery, polypeptides
were commonly practiced in view of their structural resemblance to
proteins.13,14 In general, the synthetic polypeptides required
some chemical modification steps to construct their hydrophilic functional
groups, to enhance their water miscibility, and circulation in vivo.15 The polypeptides are also structurally interesting
in view of the fact that they are capable of forming hierarchically
ordered structures of α-helices and β-sheets stabilized
by intra- and intermolecular H-bonds, respectively.16 Moreover, with these inherent amide groups, the polypeptides
tend to proceed with H bond interactions with other molecules, generating
new complex systems with the desired properties for study.

The
formation of hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complex (HIPC) between
weak polyacids, such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(methacrylic
acid), and proton-accepting polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide),17−20 poly(acrylamide),21−23 and poly(vinyl ethers),24,25 has been widely studied in the past four decades. Considerable research
studies26,27 had been conducted on various aspects of
the complex formation process in solutions and interfaces. In general,
in an aqueous solution containing mixtures of such complementary polymers,
the interpolymer association by successive H bonds leads to the formation
of compact interpolymer complexes with controlled self-assembled structures.
With the unique and extendable properties, many HIPC systems have
been investigated28−33 for their potential as a platform to deliver drugs in an efficient
and controlled manner.

The fluorescence spectrum of the pyrene
(Py) molecule contains
several vibronic peaks; among them, the intensity ratio34,35 between the first (373 nm) and the third (383 nm) vibronic peaks I1/I3 was affected
by the polarity of the surrounding solvent media. The I1/I3 ratio (so called Py scale)
ranges from low, in nonpolar hydrophobic solvents, to high, in polar
hydrophilic solvents. Therefore, this ratio provides a scale for assessing
the hydrophobicity of the environment surrounding the Py molecules.
The environmental polarity (or hydrophobicity) change upon micelles
formation had been accurately predicted through the use of the Py
scale. Besides, the large environmental hydrophobicity change during
the HIPC formation, which involves conversion from two hydrophilic
polymers to a more hydrophobic complex, also facilitated the use of
the Py scale in measuring several properties of HIPC.36−44

In this study, a Py-terminated, amphiphilic polypeptide PPM
was
prepared through multiple synthetic steps (Scheme 1) and was used as a proton-acceptor to H
bond with PAA, forming the PPM/PAA HIPC system for investigation.
For both PPM and PPM/PAA employed as the delivery systems of the cancer
drug doxorubicin (DOX), the deliberately implanted Py terminal of
PPM is the focus of this study. Through analyzing the emission spectrum
of the Py terminal, two main research goals can be achieved: first,
the critical concentrations of both the systems can be determined.
Besides the traditional approach of using the I1/I3 ratio in locating the critical
concentration, ΦF of the Py terminal was also effective
in characterizing the critical concentration. Second, the DOX-delivery
behavior can also be evaluated from the resolved I1/I3 ratio and ΦF. The loading amounts of DOX in both the systems were found
to be correlated with the I1/I3 ratio and ΦF, and more interestingly,
the DOX-releasing profiles are found to be well-correlated with the I1/I3 curves. The
facile association between the Py terminal and the incoming DOX is
responsible for this interesting phenomenon, which has never been
explored previously and provides a convenient route for accessing
the DOX-releasing behavior. Preparation effort as well as different
instrumentation analyses were conducted with the purpose to offer
new meaning of the traditional I1/I3 ratio with an intention to offer the traditional I1/I3 ratio new application.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of Initiator Py-NH2, MEO2-N3, and the Ring-Opening Polymerization (ROP) of the Monomer PLG-NCA
by Py-NH2 and the Following Click Reaction To Obtain PPM
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of an Amphiphilic PPM
The hydrophobic Py
terminal and the hydrophilic methoxy-bis(ethylene oxide) pendant chains
are the units responsible for the amphiphilicity of PPM, which was
prepared according to the synthetic steps illustrated in Scheme 1. To prepare PPM,
the polypeptide Py-PPLG precursor needed to be synthesized first.
By using amino-functionalized Py-NH245 as the initiator to initiate ROP of the cyclic peptide
monomer PLG-NCA,46 the hydrophobic Py terminal
was successfully built into the polypeptide Py-PPLG precursor. The
subsequent click reaction47−49 between the alkyne side groups
of Py-PPLG and MEO2-N343 introduced the hydrophilic methoxy-bis(ethylene oxide) units into
the side chains of PPM. The synthesis of Py-NH2 required
three steps, starting from the first substitution reaction of Py-OH
to yield Py-Br, followed by another substitution reaction to produce
Py-Ph, which was then deprotected by hydrazine to yield the desired
Py-NH2. MEO2-N3 was prepared through
the substitution reaction between sodium azide (NaN3) and
MEO2-OTs, which were prepared from the reaction of MEO2 with tosyl chloride. The involved intermediates were carefully
identified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)
and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS, Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information). The characterization
of PPM was discussed as follows.

The successful click reaction
between Py-PPLG and MEO2-N3 led to the desired
PPM, and the success of the reaction can be verified by the comparison
of the FTIR spectra of MEO2-N3, Py-PPLG, and
PPM (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The alkyne group of Py-PPLG, with the absorption peak at 2130 cm–1, and the azido group of MEO2-N3, absorbing at 2105 cm–1, are the two functional
groups involved in the click reaction. After the click reaction, the
spectrum of PPM exhibited no sign of these two absorptions, which
indicates that the click reaction must be driven to complete.

The resonance peaks of PPM and Py-PPLG were assigned in the 1H NMR (Figure 1). Among the resolved resonances, the aromatic protons (Hh of Py-PLG and Hm of PPM) of the Py terminal resonate
as weak multiplets in the downfield range from 8.0 to 8.4 ppm. The
resonance of the methylene protons (Hc of Py-PLG and Hh for PPM) attached to the α-carbon of the ester side
group is a singlet at 2.75 ppm. The integration ratio between the
resonances of the aromatic Py protons and the methylene protons can
be used to calculate the number average molecular weight (Mn) of PPM and Py-PLG. The resultant Mn’s are 2850 g/mol for Py-PPLG and 5270
g/mol for PPM, which are in good correlation with the values (2900
g/mol for Py-PPLG and 5100 g/mol for PPM, Figure S5, Supporting Information) determined from matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy.
These results are nevertheless inconsistent with the gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) results (4960 g/mol for Py-PPLG and 9930 g/mol
for PPM, Figure S6). As we know, the GPC
analysis is based on the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer chains
in the eluting solvent and gives relative molecular weights in correlation
to the polystyrene standard used in the analysis. Mn’s from the 1H NMR analysis are therefore
more reliable and are used hereafter to calculate the molar concentration
of the PPM solution.

Critical Concentrations of the Aqueous PPM
and PPM/PAA
Aqueous PPM and PPM/PAA (in 1:1 molar ratio)
solutions with concentrations
ranging from 5 × 10–5 to 5 × 10–3 M were prepared for the evaluation of the critical concentration.
Primarily, a visual inspection immediately tells us the difference
between the PPM and PPM/PAA solutions. With different concentrations,
the PPM solutions are all transparent, which is in wide contrast to
the turbid PPM/PAA solutions. The results from the dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis (Figure S9, Supporting Information) indicated that the sizes of the particles formed in both the solution
systems are different. For the PPM/PAA solutions, the resolved average
hydrodynamic diameters (Dh’s) are
in the range from 50 to 500 nm, which are comparatively larger than
the detected Dh’s (from 40 to 160
nm) of the PPM solutions. Supposedly, the larger aggregated particles
of the PPM/PAA solutions are superior in carrying more amount of drug
than the small-sized PPM solutions, a point which will be discussed
later in this discussion.

The reason why critical concentration
can be determined by the I1/I3 value is attributed to the large hydrophobicity jump
at the moment the assembled structures formed in the aqueous solution.
Instead of the traditional way of using the I1/I3 ratio to probe the critical
concentration,34,35 we found that ΦF is another convenient parameter effective in determining the critical
concentration. The key behind this is the drastic change of the Py
terminals of the PPM polymers at the moment the solution concentration
reaches the critical value and is discussed below.

In an aqueous
solution, the hydrophobic Py terminals of the amphiphilic
PPM chains undergo a major morphological change when the concentration
of PPM reaches the critical micelles concentration (cmc). In dilute
aqueous solution before cmc, the Py terminals of the isolated PPM
chains are surrounded by a vast majority of water molecules. The emission
of the Py terminal should resemble that of the pure Py molecule. As
we know, a pure Py molecule is a transitional fluorophore with the
aggregation-caused quenching50−52 (ACQ) property, that is, the
aggregated Py molecules emit less efficiently than the isolated Py
molecules. In the dilute solution, the isolated Py terminal of PPM
is virtually exempted from the detrimental ACQ effect, and therefore,
it emitted efficiently (Figure 2A). In contrast, at concentrations higher than cmc, the amphiphilic
PPM chains formed micelles consisting of an inner hydrophobic core,
mainly composed of the aggregated Py terminals, and an outer hydrophilic
polypeptide shell. Inside the inner core, the aggregated Py terminals
emit less efficiently because of the detrimental ACQ effect. At the
critical point that the solution concentration reaches cmc, the aggregation
of the Py terminals and the related emission efficiency are subjected
to a sudden change. Therefore, ΦF was expected to
be effective in the determination of the critical concentration.

Figure 2 Emission
spectra of the aqueous (A) PPM and (B) PPM/PAA solutions
with different solution concentrations (λex = 340
nm).

Adding PAA into the dilute solution
of PPM should not change the
basic feature of the Py terminals of the PPM chains. In the dilute
solution, the Py terminals of the PPM chains are still in the isolated
form and are exempted from the detrimental ACQ effect. The Py terminals
of the PPM chains therefore emitted intensely (Figure 2B). An increase in the solution concentration
enhances mutual contacts and the accompanied H bond interactions between
the PPM and PAA chains. As the solution concentration reaches the
critical aggregation concentration (CAC), interchain H bond interactions
between PPM and PAA occur to induce the formation of the interassociated
aggregates. The initial hydrophilic functions (i.e., the carboxylic
acids of PAA and oxide atoms of PPM) are now participating in the
H bond interactions, rendering aggregates with higher hydrophobicity
than the PPM and PAA chains in the dilute solution. Within the hydrophobic
aggregates, the aromatic Py terminals tend to associate together and
therefore emit with an attenuated intensity with the detrimental ACQ
effect. In this case, increasing the concentration above CAC should
cause a drastic change on ΦF.

The corresponding
ΦF and I1/I3 values adopted from Figure 2 are illustrated
in Figure 3, in which
the resolved ΦF and I1/I3 values from the initial dilute solutions
are quite constant but decline suddenly after the critical points.
Extrapolations of the I1/I3 values resulted in the cmc value of 3.9 × 10–4 M for PPM and a CAC value of 2 × 10–4 M for PPM/PAA, respectively. An analogous extrapolation of ΦF values also gave the same values as those from the I1/I3 ratios, which
suggests that ΦF is also effective in locating the
critical concentration. To demonstrate the validity of the above values,
solution transmittance measurements by the UV–vis spectra were
also conducted. Similar to the I1/I3 ratio, the solution transmittances (Figure
S7, Supporting Information) of both systems
are rather high (∼100%) in dilution solution, but they decrease
abruptly when the solution concentration approaches the critical values.
Extrapolation of the transmittances resulted in the same cmc and CAC
values with those obtained from I1/I3 and ΦF. The critical concentrations
determined from I1/I3 and ΦF are therefore accurate.

Characterization of DOX
Loading
For drug loading, the
concentrations of PPM and PAA were fixed at the same value of 2 ×
10–3 M. By loading different amounts of DOX, the
PPM/DOX and PPM/PAA/DOX solutions (Table 1) were prepared for the DOX-loading study.
Here, the applied concentrations of PPM (2 × 10−3 M) and PPM/PAA (2 × 10−3 M/2 × 10−3 M ) are all higher than the critical values of the
respective DOX-loading PPM/DOX and PPM/PAA/DOX solutions. Compared
to the PPM solution, the PPM/PAA solution is a better drug-loading
system because the PPM/PAA solution can carry more DOX drugs without
the early precipitation of DOX from the corresponding solution (the
ultimate DOX loads of PPM/PAA and PPM are 6.9 × 10–3 and 7 × 10–4 M, respectively) during the
preparative step. This result can be confirmed from the drug-loading
content (DLC) and the drug-loading efficiency (DLE) summarized in Table 1. The resolved DLC
and DLE values of the PPM/PAA solutions are all higher than those
of the PPM solution. For the PPM/PAA/DOX1 solution, a maximum DLE
of 93% can be achieved. The large aggregates formed in the PPM/PAA
solutions are capable of carrying more DOX compared to the small micelles
formed in the PPM solutions.

× 10–3 M/7 × 10–4 M.

d PPM/PAA/DOX1 = 2 × 10–3 M/2 × 10–3M/1.7 × 10–3 M, PPM/PAA/DOX2 = 2 × 10–3 M/2 × 10–3 M/2.8 × 10–3 M, PPM/PAA/DOX3
= 2 × 10–3 M/2 × 10–3 M/4.3 × 10–3 M, PPM/PAA/DOX4 = 2 × 10–3 M/2 × 10–3 M/6.9 × 10–3 M.

We found
in this study that the Py terminals of PPM can preferably
associate with the DOX molecules to form an aggregated species with
a varied emission behavior. To demonstrate this, a pure
Py molecule was used as a model compound to simulate the possible
association between the Py terminal and DOX. As anticipated, the emission
of the Py molecule decreases with the increase of DOX in the solution
(Figure 4A). If the
reduced emission is due to the formation of the Py/DOX complex, we
may expect the same influence of Py on DOX. The result illustrated
in Figure 4B indicated
that the emission of DOX at a longer wavelength region (>500 nm)
also
decreases with the increase of Py in the solution. Therefore, the
corresponding Py/DOX complex formed is inferior in its emission efficiency
than the individual Py and DOX. The preferable formation of the Py/DOX
complex is possible in considering the molecular geometry of DOX and
Py. The fluorescent part of the DOX molecule is a three-ring, planar
hydroxyanthraquinone (HA) unit, which is geometrically allowed to
approach and pack intimately with the three-ring, planar Py molecule,
rendering a well-packed complex with an inferior emission efficiency.
Moreover, the electron-deficient carbonyl functions of the HA unit
of DOX should facilitate the interaction with the electron-rich Py
molecule. The intimate association between Py and DOX results in a
Py/DOX complex with the correlated I1/I3 and ΦF as discussed below.

Figure 4 Emission
spectra of (A) Py (10–4 M) with different
molar ratios of DOX in N,N-dimethyl
formamide (DMF, λex = 340 nm) and (B) DOX (10–4 M) with different molar ratios of Py in DMF (λex = 477 nm).

As illustrated in Figure S11,
the I1/I3 and
ΦF values adopted from Figure 4A decline with the same rate upon the increase
of the
DOX concentration in the solution. As described above, I1/I3 depends on the hydrophobicity
of the environment surrounding the Py molecules, whereas the extent
of aggregation affects ΦF of Py. The progressive
lowering of the I1/I3 ratio indicates that the hydrophobic Py/DOX complexes preferably
form upon the addition of DOX. Within the complex aggregates formed
in the solution, the Py molecules are situated in a more hydrophobic
environment than the pure Py molecule. Therefore, increasing the DOX
content results in a more hydrophobic Py/DOX complex. Similarly, the
progressive lowering of the ΦF value also indicates
that the extent of aggregation of the Py/DOX complex is enhanced upon
the increase of DOX loaded in the solution. It is difficult to draw
a theoretical foundation for the correlated I1/I3 and ΦF because
complicated factors are involved in the final outcome of the I1/I3 and ΦF values. Presently, the correlated I1/I3 and ΦF can
be treated as empirical results, which can be used for further exploration
of the DOX-delivery behavior.

As with the Py molecule, the Py
terminal of PPM should preferably
react with DOX to result in the emission reduction. Therefore, the
emission spectra of the aqueous PPM/DOX (Figure 5A) and PPM/PAA/DOX (Figure 5B) solutions illustrate the anticipated trend
that the emission intensity of the PPM (or PPM/PAA) solution decreases
as the DOX content increases. The decrease of the emission intensity
was reflected in the decrease of ΦF values for the
PPM/DOX (Figure 6A)
and the PPM/PAA/DOX (Figure 6B) solutions. As with the aforementioned Py/DOX case, an association
between DOX and the Py terminal of PPM must occur preferably to result
in an attenuated emission. The resolved I1/I3 ratio also exhibits the same descendent
trend with the increase of the DOX content in the solution. A lower I1/I3 ratio refers
to a more hydrophobic environment surrounding the Py terminals of
PPM in solution. A planar DOX molecule must react with the planar
Py terminal to result in hydrophobic Py/DOX complexes with a lower I1/I3 ratio.

10–3 M), DOX3 (4.3 × 10–3 M), DOX4 (6.9 × 10–3 M) solutions (λex = 340 nm).

10–3 M) with different concentrations of DOX and
(B) PPM (2 × 10–3 M)/PAA (2 × 10–3 M) with different concentrations of DOX.

As discussed above, the PPM/PAA solution is superior in carrying
more DOX, forming aggregates with a larger size than the PPM solution.
Because the aggregates formed in the PPPM/PAA solution are capable
of carrying more hydrophobic Py/DOX complexes, the resolved I1/I3 ratios of the
PPM/PAA/DOX solutions (Figure 6B) are therefore lower than those (Figure 6A) from the PPM/DOX solution. I1/I3 ratio is therefore a
convenient measure for determining the amounts of DOX loaded in the
carriers.

In Vitro DOX Release
In studying the in vitro release
of DOX, the PPM/DOX1 and PPM/PAA/DOX1 solutions were selected for
the measurements conducted in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
(pH 7.4). Despite the higher DOX content of PPM/PAA/DOX1 as compared
to PPM//DOX1 (1.7 × 10–3 vs 4 × 10–4 M, Table 1), PPM/PAA/DOX1 still has a slower release rate according
to the resultant release profiles illustrated in Figure 7. Within 24 h, at 37 °C,
more than 90% of DOX had been released from the PPM/DOX1 solution.
In contrast, only 70% of DOX was released from the PPM/PAA/DOX solution
after 24 h.

Figure 7 Release profile of DOX (solid lines) and the I1/I3 (dashed lines) values
adapted from the emission spectra for the aqueous PPM/DOX1 solution
(PPM/DOX = 2 × 10–3 M/4 × 10–4 M) and the aqueous PPM/PAA/DOX1 solution (PPM/PAA/DOX = 2 ×
10–3 M/2 × 10–3 M/1.7 ×
10–3 M) in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C.

As a reverse process of the DOX-loading process,
the release of
DOX should result in an emission enhancement, as against the emission
reduction (Figure 5) observed in the DOX-loading study. The emission results in Figure 8 indeed illustrated
the expected trend that the emission of PPM/DOX1 and PPM/PAA/DOX1
gradually increases over the period of 48 h. As more DOXs were released
from the carriers over time, higher I1/I3 and ΦF were resolved
for both PPM/DOX1 (Figure 9A) and PPM/PAA/DOX1 (Figure 9B) solutions. Again, as with the small-mass Py/DOX
system, the correlation between I1/I3 and ΦF is quite good for
both the polymeric systems.

10–3 M/1.7 × 10–3 M) solutions
during the DOX release at 37 °C (λex = 340 nm).

and ΦF values during the release of DOX from the
aqueous PPM/DOX1 (PPM/DOX = 2 × 10–3 M/4 ×

10–3 M/2 × 10–3 M/1.7 ×
10–3 M) solutions at 37 °C.

In contrast to the ΦF value, the I1/I3 ratio was found
to be
useful in assessing the release percentage of DOX, obtained from the
UV–vis absorption spectra (cf. Experimental
Section). Interestingly, the correlation between I1/I3 and the cumulative release
percentage is rather high as we inspected the I1/I3 data (dashed line) included
in Figure 8. The use
of the I1/I3 ratio in determining the DOX-releasing process has never been attempted
previously and is rather convenient as it only required an in situ
emission measurement. Here, the consistence between the I1/I3 ratio and the cumulative
release percentage is due to the sensitive hydrophobicity change involved
in the dissociation of the Py/DOX complex during the release course.
As discussed above, within the aggregated Py/DOX domains, the incorporated
DOX drugs contribute to the hydrophobic environment surrounding the
Py terminals, and the detachment of DOX from the Py/DOX aggregates
should result in the lowering of the hydrophobicity and the corresponding
increase in the I1/I3 ratio. The I1/I3 ratio of the Py/DOX complex must be rather sensitive
to the environmental hydrophobicity change to have a good correlation
with the DOX-release profile from the UV–vis absorbance measurements.

Conclusions
An amphiphilic polypeptide PPM was successfully
prepared by ROP
of the peptide monomer PLG-NCA in the presence of the Py-NH2 initiator. PPM was then mixed with PAA to form the PPM/PAA HIPC
system.

The Py terminal of PPM in this study provides a convenient
measure
for determining the critical concentration of the aqueous PPM and
PPM/PAA solutions. The consistent results from the I1/I3 ratio and ΦF of the Py terminals gave the same critical concentration.
The H bond interaction between PPM and PAA enhances the formation
of aggregates with particle size larger than that of PPM. The larger
particles formed in the PPM/PAA solution also help loading more DOX
drug compared to the smaller micelles formed in the PPM solution.

Because of the preferable formation of the hydrophobic DOX/Py aggregates,
the I1/I3 ratio
and ΦF of the Py terminal can be used to determine
the amounts of DOX loaded in the aqueous PPM and PPM/PAA solutions.
The DOX loading decreases the I1/I3 and ΦF values; therefore,
the reverse DOX-releasing process results in the increase of I1/I3 and ΦF. The I1/I3 and ΦF curves were found to be correlated
with the release profiles of DOX in both PPM/DOX1 and PPM/PAA/DOX1
solutions.

Preparation
of Py-Ph
A solution of Py-Br (0.4 g, 1.35
mmol) and phthalimide potassium salt (0.37 g, 2.03 mmol) in dry DMF
(10 mL) was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h under argon. The resultant
solution mixtures were concentrated by rotary evaporation and were
redissolved in dichloromethane. The whole solution was then washed
with aq 10% NaHCO3 solution (2 × 50 mL) and water
(2 × 50 mL). The collected organic layer was then distilled off
to yield the final solid product (0.35 g, 87.5%). 1H NMR

(m, 13H, Hpy,b,c), 5.53 (s, 2H, Ha) (Figure S2); Anal. Calcd: C, 83.09; H, 4.18; N,
3.88. Found: C, 83.15; H, 4.23; N, 3.83.

Preparation of Py-NH2
A solution of Py-Ph
(0.3 g, 0.83 mmol) and hydrazine hydrate (0.268 mL, 5.5 mmol) in ethanol
(10 mL) was stirred at 65 °C for 24 h under argon. The resultant
precipitate was filtered off and washed several times with ethanol.
The solid was then dried under vacuum to obtain the final product
(0.22 g, 73%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 8.4–7.8 (m, 9H), 4.49 (s, 2H, Ha) (Figure S2); Anal. Calcd: C,
88.28; H, 5.67; N, 6.06. Found: C, 88.19; H, 5.74; N, 6.02.

Synthesis
of 1-(2-Methoxyethoxy)-2-azidoethane (MEO2-N3)
Into an ice-cooled solution of MEO2 (18.3 mL,
150 mmol) and tosyl chloride (21.2 mL, 180 mmol) in THF
(200 mL), triethylamine (25 mL, 180 mmol) was added dropwise over
a period of 20 min. The solution mixture was then gradually warmed
to room temperature and stirred overnight. The resultant solution
was diluted with water (200 mL), and the pH of the resultant solution
was adjusted to be neutral by adding NaHCO3. Sodium azide
(11.8 g, 180 mmol) was then added, and the reaction mixtures were
refluxed overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the mixtures
were extracted by Et2O. The combined organic phase was
dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to obtain a
yellow oil. The final product was obtained by eluting from CH2Cl2/methanol (v/v = 15/1). 1H NMR (500
MHz, CDCl3): δ 2.89–2.80 (m, 6H, Hb,c,d), 2.72 (s, 3H, Ha), 2.32 (t, 2H, He) (Figure S3).

ROP of PLG-NCA to Prepare
Py-PPLG
The solution of PLG-NCA
(5.612 g, 26.57 mmol) in dry DMF (25 mL) was stirred and bubbled with
argon for 30 min before the solution of Py-NH2 (0.03 g,
0.13 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) was injected through a syringe. The reaction
mixture was stirred for 2 days at room temperature, and the resultant
polymer was precipitated from Et2O and dried in a vacuum
oven. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CD2Cl2 + CF3COOD (1/1, v/v)): δ 8.8 (broad, Hf), 8.0–8.4
(m, 9H, Hh), 4.8–4.9 (s, 3H, Hb,e), 4.5
(broad, 2H, Hg), 2.7–2.8 (broad, 2H, Hc), 2.6 (s, 1H, Ha), 2.1–2.5 (broad, 2H, Hd) (Figure 1). MALDI-TOF: Mn 2900 g/mol, Mw 3270 g/mol, polydispersity 1.12 (Figure S6); GPC (DMF): Mn 4960 g/mol, Mw 6150 g/mol, polydispersity 1.23 (Figure S7).

Preparation of PPM by Click
Reaction
The solution of
Py-PPLG (1 g, 0.37 mmol) and CuBr (0.1 g, 0.68 mmol) in dry DMF (30
mL) was subjected to three freeze/pump/thaw cycles before the addition
of MEO2-N3 (3 g, 20 mmol). Three more freeze/pump/thaw
cycles of the resultant mixtures were further conducted before PMDETA
(0.3 mL, 1.73 mmol) was added through a syringe. The reaction mixtures
were then carefully degassed through three freeze/pump/thaw cycles
and were heated at 60 °C for 24 h. After cooled to room temperature,
the resultant solution mixtures in DMF were passed through a neutral
alumina column to remove the copper catalysts. The eluent was concentrated
and precipitated from Et2O. The resultant solid was filtered
off and dried under vacuum at room temperature to obtain the final
product. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CD2Cl2 +
CF3COOD (1/1, v/v)): δ 8.8 (broad, Hk),
8.6 (s, 1H, Hf), 8.0–8.4 (m, 9H, Hm),
5.5–5.6 (broad, 2H, Hg), 5.0 (s, 2H, He), 4.8 (s, 1H, Hj), 4.5 (s, 2H, Hl), 4.15 (s,
2H, Hd), 3.9 (s, 4H, Hb,c), 3.65 (s, 3H, Ha), 2.75 (broad, 2H, Hh), 2.1–2.5 (broad,
2H, Hi) (Figure 1). MALDI-TOF: Mn 5199 g/mol, Mw 5780 g/mol, polydispersity 1.13 (Figure S6); GPC (DMF): Mn 9930 g/mol, Mw 12 900
g/mol, polydispersity 1.30 (Figure S7).

Preparation and Characterization of the Aqueous PPM, PPM/PAA,
PPM/DOX, and PPM/PAA/DOX Nanoparticles
The aqueous PPM, PPM/PAA,
PPM/DOX, and PPM/PAA/DOX solutions were prepared by stepwise additions,
with the corresponding solutions thoroughly mixed by stirring for
2 h, of the calculated amounts of PPM, PAA, and DOX in deionized water.
The DOX-loaded nanoparticle solutions were then dialyzed against deionized
water (100 mL) for 12 h, by using a dialysis bag (MWCO = 1000 g/mol,
Orange Scientific), to remove the unloaded DOX.

The amounts
of DOX loaded into the nanoparticles were determined from an absorbance
calibration curve of DOX in deionized water (Figure S10A). The DLC and DLE were calculated using the following
formula 1   2  

In Vitro Drug Release
The release
behavior of DOX from
the carrier solution was performed in 100 mL PBS (pH 7.4, Sigma) at
37 °C. A 5 mL volume of the DOX-loaded solution was sealed in
a dialysis bag (MWCO = 1000 g/mol, Orange Scientific). At designated
time intervals, 1 mL of the release media was removed for emission
spectral analysis, to determine the I1/I3 ratio and ΦE values,
and for UV–vis spectra, to determine the amounts of DOX released,
by the absorbance calibration curve, in PBS solution at pH 7.4 (Figure S10B). At the same time, an equal volume
of fresh media was added to the release system. The cumulative release
percentage of DOX was calculated according to the following equation55,56 3  where mDOX is
the amount of DOX encapsulated in the solution particles, V0 is the volume of the release media (V0 = 100 mL), Vt is
the volume of the replaced media (Vt =
1 mL), and Cn is the
concentration of DOX in the sample.

Characterization
The FTIR spectra were recorded with
a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrophotometer; 32 scans were collected
at a spectral resolution of 1 cm–1. The solid powders
were homogeneously blended with KBr before being pressed to make pellets
for measurement. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded by a
Varian Unity VXR-500 MHz instrument. The mass spectra were obtained
from a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI-TOF, and DCTB (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile)
was used as the matrix. The relative molecular weights of the polymers
were determined through GPC using the Waters 510 high-performance
liquid chromatography system, with DMF as the eluent and at a flow
rate of 0.8 mL min–1. The molecular weight calibration
curve was obtained from the polystyrene standards. The UV–vis
absorption and transmittance spectra were recorded with a JASCO V-770
spectrophotometer. The emission spectra were obtained from a LabGuide
X350 fluorescence spectrophotometer using a 450 W Xe lamp as the continuous
light source. A small quartz cell with the dimensions of 0.2 ×
1.0 × 4.5 cm3 was used to accommodate the solution
sample for absorption, transmittance, and emission spectra. ΦF is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted
to the number of photons absorbed, which was determined by comparing
with a quinine sulfate standard solution (10–4 M
in 1 N H2SO4). Experimentally, ΦF was determined by comparing with a quinine sulfate standard solution
(10–4 M in 1 N H2SO4) according
to the following equation 4  where Φ is the quantum
yield, PL is
the area under the emission peak, A is the absorbance
at the excitation wavelength, and n is the refractive
index. The subscript R denotes the respective values of the reference
quinine sulfate and the subscript S denotes the respective values
of the sample.

The particle sizes in deionized water were measured
by DLS on a Brookhaven 90 plus spectrometer at room temperature. A
He–Ne laser operating at 633 nm was used as the light source.
