An efficient, environmentally benign,
and inexpensive procedure
has been developed for the synthesis of fluorinated 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines
by microwave irradiation using basic alumina as a solid-support agent
as well as a solid base. Notably, this protocol features improved
energy efficiency, broad isothiourea substrate scope, easily available
starting materials, and high atom efficiency and applicability toward
gram-scale synthesis. Additionally, the target compounds were evaluated
for the cytotoxic effect against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT116
and HT29), human gastric cancer (SGC-7901), human lung adenocarcinoma
(A549), and human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells, and it was found
that these compounds have excellent antitumor activities. Among them,
compound 3e was found to be one of the most potent derivatives
with IC50 values lower than 9.44 μM against five
human tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin (DDP).
Furthermore, for the first time, the fluorinated 2-alkylthio-substituted
4-aminoquinazolines were identified as phosphatase CDC25B inhibitors.

Introduction
One of the vital and
sensible alternatives of organic synthesis
is necessary to develop new methods to achieve greener chemical processes.1−8 Recently, green synthesis has been encouraged by the search for
eco-friendly reaction media or solvent-free to replace commonly used
volatile and hazardous organic solvents as well as to avoid the use
of toxic and complex catalytic systems.9−15 Moreover, more efficient microwave sources are being used to improve
the energy efficiency in the chemical process.16−21

Quinazolines are an important class of N-containing heterocyclic
compounds that have increasingly attracted considerable attention
because of their diverse pharmacological activities, and they can
be used as spinal muscular atrophy therapeutics,22 antiatrial fibrillation agents,23 anticancer drugs,24−28 antimalarial agents,29 etc.30−32 In particular, as one of the diverse quinazoline derivatives, 4-aminoquinazoline
nucleus is commonly present in a variety of drug molecules and biologically
active agents.30−33 For example, gefitinib (Iressa)34,35 and lapatinib
(Tykerb)36 have been extensively used as
inhibitors of tyrosine kinases for the treatment of nonsmall cell
lung cancer and breast cancer, respectively (Figure 1). CCT241533 blocked checkpoint kinase 2
activity in human tumor cell lines in response to DNA damage (Figure 1).37 Prazosin (Minipress) had effective α-adrenergic blocking
activity, which is thus useful as antihypertensive medication (Figure 1).38,39 Many attempts have been made over the last few decades to introduce
a combinatorial library of 4-aminoquinazolines.30−32 Because of
the value and importance of the sulfur-containing compounds in pharmaceuticals,40 introducing different thioether groups into
the 4-aminoquinazoline moiety would be of great synthetic value. However,
the preparation of 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline derivatives has
only been reported in a limited number of cases. The main synthetic
methods can be summarized as follows: (1) the nucleophilic addition/cyclization
reaction of anthranilonitriles with isothiocyanate derivatives41,42 or N-[bis(methylthio)methylene]-amino ester43 and (2) alternatively, 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines
can be prepared by the decoration of the existing quinazoline nucleus.44 Despite the values of these methods, most of
them were developed without concern for environmental consequences
and involve the use of hazardous and volatile solvents, strong basic
or toxic catalysts, and multistep reaction processes (Scheme 1, eq 1). In addition, the sulfur-containing
substrate scope of these methods is limited. Therefore, a search for
more efficient and environmentally benign procedures for the synthesis
of pharmacologically potent 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines remains
a valid objective in organic, medicinal, and combinatorial chemistry.

Scheme 1 Mechanism Hypotheses for the Synthesis of Target Compounds 3
Polyfluoro benzenedicarbonitriles
are a class of interesting and
versatile synthetic building blocks for the construction of various
fluorinated compounds45−52 or synthetic materials in organic synthesis.53 Some of these fluorinated compounds possess anticancer,45−49 anti-HIV, or antibacterial50−52 biological activity. Fluorine
incorporation into biologically active compounds can alter drug metabolism
or enzyme substrate recognition.54−56 The hydrophobic nature
of fluorinated compounds has also been cited for their ability to
improve the transport across the blood–brain barrier. Because
of the unique effects of F-substituents in pharmaceutical formulations,
the use of fluorinated compounds as bioactive or functional molecules
has recently increased. Additionally, polyfluoro benzenedicarbonitriles
are used as the raw material to introduce fluorine and cyanide in
target compounds so that fluoro and cyano groups can be derived to
subsequently generate a molecular diversity of 4-aminoquinazoline
derivatives.

Considering the above studies and in continuation
of our interest
in the synthesis of fluorinated fused-ring compounds with pharmacological
activity,45−52 herein, we report an environmentally benign method and a new alternative
route for the synthesis of 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines, with a
broader sulfur-containing substrate scope, through a microwave-assisted
solid-phase heterogeneous reaction (Scheme 1). To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis
of 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines derivatives has not been reported
by the cyclization reaction of o-fluorobenzonitriles
with S-substituted isothiouronium salts.

Results and Discussion
S-Alkyl isothiouronium salts 2 are environmentally
benign and inexpensive, as they are readily produced by the reaction
of thiourea with the appropriate alkyl halides57,58 (Supporting Information). Accordingly, S-butyl isothiourea hydrobromide 2a was chosen
as a model substrate to react with 2,4,5,6-tetrafluoro-isophthalonitrile 1a (Table 1).

a Conventional reaction conditions:
the reaction was carried out using 2,4,5,6-tetrafluoroisophthalonitrile 1a (1.0 mmol), S-butyl isothiourea hydrobromide 2a (1.3 mmol), base (1.0 mmol), and solvent (10 mL).

b Microwave-assisted reaction conditions:
a mixture of 1a (1 mmol) and 2a (1.3 mmol)
was adsorbed on a solid support (2 or 3 g) with the help of ethanol.
The reaction mixture was irradiated in a microwave reactor (600 W).

c Microwave-assisted reaction
conditions:
a mixture of 1a (1 mmol) and 2a (1.5 mmol)
was adsorbed on a solid support (2 or 3 g) with the help of ethanol.
The reaction mixture was irradiated in a microwave reactor (600 W).

d The reaction was performed
in an
oil bath.

e Isolated yield
based on 1a.

Initially, when the reaction was conducted in the presence of 1
equiv K2CO3 at 120 °C in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), the desired product, 2-(butylthio)-4-aminoquinazoline derivative 3a, was obtained with a yield of 48% (entry 1). This result
motivated us to test different solvents and bases. However, acetonitrile
and 1,4-dioxane did not clearly improve the yield of 3a (Table 1, entry 2
vs entries 2–3). Compared with K2CO3, t-BuOK and Cs2CO3 provided lower and
slightly improved yields, respectively (Table 1, entry 3 vs entries 4–5). Additionally,
the reaction did not proceed smoothly in the absence of a base (Table 1, entry 6). These
findings led us to find a newer protocol that combines the use of
basic alumina and microwave irradiation. Basic alumina is a widely
used heterogeneous catalyst and has gained prominence in several areas
of organic synthesis.19,59,60 A mixture of 1a and 2a was adsorbed onto
basic alumina (2 or 3 g) using ethanol as the solvent. The reaction
mixture was irradiated in a microwave reactor for 20 min. The result
showed that the microwave condition used can considerably improve
the product yield (82%, Table 1, entries 7–9 vs entry 10). In contrast, no product
was observed when the reaction was adsorbed onto the surface of a
silica gel and neutral alumina (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). The results additionally revealed
that basic alumina is the most adaptable support, which also acts
as a solid base promoter for the synthesis of 3a, as
indicated by the comparatively higher yield achieved in a shorter
time (Table 1, entry
7). The use of a low-cost solid support eliminates the need for any
external basic catalyst as required under thermal conditions.

Under the optimized reaction conditions, we investigated the scope
of the reaction involving polyfluoro benzenedicarbonitriles (1a, 1b) with various substituted isothiouronium
salts 2. In the cases where the reaction was completed,
there were no great discrepancies in the reactivity and product yield
for 1a and 1b (Table 2). The data in Table 2 reveal that the S-alkyl/alkyl ethers isothiouronium
salts were all good substrates for the cyclization reaction under
the microwave-assisted condition and produced the appropriate 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines 3a–3l within 20 min. In general, short carbon chain
isothiouronium salts often produced higher yields than those with
long carbon chain (Table 2). When the S-benzyl/naphthalen-2-ylmethyl/allyl/cyanomethyl
isothiouronium salts were used as substrates for the cyclization reaction
under the same condition, the yield of the target product was good
with shorter reaction time (Table 2, 3m–3x). In an effort to expand
the scope of substrates 1, tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile 1c was reacted with different substituted isothiouronium salts 2. Compared with 1a–1b, the reaction can
also provide the target compounds 3y–3c′ with moderate yields, but both the reaction temperature and time
had to be increased (Table 2 vs 3).

conditions: a mixture of
polyfluoro benzenedicarbonitriles 1 (1.0 mmol) and isothiouronium

a microwave reactor.

g) with the help of ethanol. The reaction mixture was irradiated in
a microwave reactor.

b Isolated
yield based on 1c.

The feasibility of the present method was also examined for a somewhat
scaled-up (on the gram scale) experiment: a mixture of 2,4,5,6-tetrafluoroisophthalonitrile 1a (2.00 g 10 mmol) and S-methyl isothiourea
hydroiodide 2e (2.83 g 13 mmol) was adsorbed onto basic
alumina (20 g) using ethanol as the solvent. The reaction mixture
was then irradiated in a microwave reactor for 20 min. The reaction
was found to proceed smoothly, producing the desired product 2-(methylthio)-4-amino-6-carbonitrile-5,7,8-trifluoroquinazoline
(3e), with a yield of 78% (2.10 g), which was similar
in all respects with the 1 mmol scale entry (Table 2, 3e). This result demonstrated
the efficiency of the solid support for gram-scale production as well.

The 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectra, IR spectra,
and high-resolution mass spectra analysis data confirmed the structure
of the target compounds 3. To specifically determine
the structure, 3e was characterized by X-ray crystallography
as a representative compound, as shown in Figure 2 (CCDC 1568305).

Figure 2 X-ray crystal structure
of 3e (ellipsoids are drawn
at the 30% probability level).

According to the above results, the promising performance
of basic
alumina could be attributed to the presence of Al–OH groups
on the alumina surface.61,62 Thus, we reasoned that
basic alumina would be effective as a promoter in the reaction process
because it may involve the formation of the hydrogen-bond interaction
of the nitrile group of intermediate 6 with the surface
hydroxyl group on the basic alumina. Accordingly, we propose a plausible
mechanism for the formation of 4-aminoquinazolines 3 (Scheme 2). The first step
involves the release of free isothiourea compounds 4 from
the adsorption reaction of its hydrogen halide with basic alumina.
The second step is the nucleophilic aromatic substitution at o-fluoro
of the polyfluoro benzenedicarbonitriles 1, which is
promoted by basic alumina, to generate intermediate 5. Then, benzonitrile is activated by the surface O–H group
on the basic alumina followed by the N-nucleophilic amine attacks
on the nitrile group to form intermediate 7. Last, intermediate 7 was used to obtain target compound 3 by tautomerization.

Scheme 2 Mechanism Hypotheses for the Synthesis of Target Compounds 3
We selected 17 of
the 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline derivatives
to evaluate the in vitro antitumor activity against a series of human
cells according to a previously reported method.63 The tumor cell lines chosen were colon adenocarcinoma (HCT116
and HT29), gastric cancer (SGC-7901), lung adenocarcinoma (A549),
and hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Cisplatin (DDP) was used as
the reference drug. The results of the cytotoxicity analysis data
are summarized in Table 4 (IC50). As shown in Table 4, most of the compounds exhibited excellent antitumor
activity against the cancer cells. Indeed, 3a, 3e–3h, 3j–3l, 3n, 3q, 3r, 3w, and 3x are
more active than cisplatin against HCT116 cells (Table 4, entries 1 and 5–16); 3a, 3e–3h, 3j–3l, 3q, 3w, and 3x are more active than
cisplatin against HT29 cells (Table 4, entries 1, 5–11, 13, 15, and 16); 3e–3h, 3j, 3k, 3l, 3n, 3q, 3w, and 3x are more
active than cisplatin against SGC-7901 cells (Table 4, entries 5–9, 11–13, 15, and
16). These data indicate that most of the 2-alkythio-4-aminoquinazoline
derivatives are usually most active against the colon adenocarcinoma
(HCT116 and HT29) and gastric cancer (SGC-7901) cells, whereas the
2-(octylthio)-4-aminoquinazoline derivatives are usually less active
against HCT116, HT29, and SGC-7901 cells (Table 4, entries 3 and 4). Only three compounds,
namely, 3e, 3w, and 3x, are
more active than cisplatin against HepG2 cells (Table 4, entries 5, 15, and 16). Seven compounds, 3e–3h, 3j, 3l, and 3x, are more active than cisplatin against A549 cells (Table 4, entries 5–9,
11, and 16). Among them, compounds 3e and 3x were more potent against all the tumor cell lines (HCT116, HT29,
SGC-7901, A549, and HepG2) than cisplatin (DDP) (Table 4, entries 5 and 16). These results
reveal that 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline derivatives also have good
inhibitory activity against HCT116, HT29, A549, HepG2, and SGC-7901
cells. Additionally, the substituted group also has an influence on
the cytotoxic activities. In general, the contribution order of the
groups of 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines to cytotoxic activities
was methyl ≈ naphthalen-2-ylmethyl ≈ 2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethyl
≈ (tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl > 2-methoxyethyl ≈
allyl
≈ benzyl ≈ n-butyl > n-octyl (Scheme 3).

Overexpression of CDC25B is frequently found in many
cancers, such
as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular
carcinoma, and so forth. Thus, the inhibition of CDC25B may represent
a novel approach for the development of anticancer therapeutics.64−66 For one thing, it is encouraged by the above findings. For another
thing, the planar conformation and structural feature of 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline
will contribute to this molecule acting on the cell division cycle
25B dual specificity phosphatase (CDC25B).67−69 What is more,
to the best of our knowledge, no inhibition against CDC25B activity
has been reported with 4-aminoquinazoline scaffold. Accordingly, the
new compounds 3 were screened for their inhibitory activities
against CDC25B using an in vitro fluorimetric assay described in the
literature.70,71 As shown in Table 5, except for compounds 3g, 3h, and 3v (Table 5, entries 7, 8, and 22), most
of the 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline derivatives showed a considerable
inhibitory activity against CDC25B at a concentration of 20 μg/mL
(Table 5, entries 1–6,
9–21, and 23–29). In order to evaluate the inhibitory
activity more accurately, we selected 17 compounds from the preliminary
screened results to evaluate the in vitro IC50 value against
CDC25B (Table 5, entries
2–4, 9–11, 13, 14, 17–20, 23–25, 28, and
29). In all cases, good CDC25B inhibitory activity was observed. In
particular, compounds 3b, 3n, 3t, and 3w (Table 5, entries 2, 14, 20, and 23) showed potent inhibitory activity
against CDC25B (IC50 < 0.50 μg/mL) and close to
the reference compound Na3VO4. These results
reveal that 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline derivatives represent a
new class of inhibitors against CDC25B.

On the basis of the target compounds 3, excellent
antitumor activity was exhibited against HTC116 cells (Table 4). We chose three compounds
(3j, 3n, and 3w) with distinct
2-alkylthio differences to investigate the distribution of the cell-cycle
progression of HTC116. Cells were treated with different doses of 3j, 3n, and 3w (1.02 or 2.56 μM)
and DMSO for 24 h. Untreated cells were used as controls, and they
exhibited a normal cell-cycle distribution (Figure 3a). Compared with the control cells, the
percentage of cells in the G1 phase was significantly increased in
the cells incubated with 1.02 μM compounds 3j and 3n (Figure 3b,c). The fraction of cells in the S phase decreased accordingly,
while the proportion of G2/M phase cells showed no obvious change
(Table 6). Our data
suggest that compounds 3j and 3n may induce
cancer cell apoptosis via arresting the cells at the G1 phase in the
cell cycle. In contrast, 2.56 μM 3w blocked cell
passage through the G2-M phase in HCT116 cells (Figure 3d). The fraction of cells in the G1 phase
decreased accordingly, while the proportion of S phase cells showed
no obvious change (Table 6). This G2-M arrest occurred only with compound 3w and was not observed with two other structural analogues (3j, 3n). These results suggested that the inhibition
potency for CDC25B phosphatases is well-correlated with G169,72 or G2/M-arresting activity in HCT116 cells.

Figure 3 (a) Untreated cells were
used as controls; (b,c) compounds 3j and 3n induce G1 phase arrest; and (d) 3w induces G2-M phase
arrest in HTC116 cells. Cells were treated
with 1.02 μM of compounds 3j and 3n and 2.56 μM of compound 3w for 24 h. The cell
cycle was determined by DAPI staining and analyzed with a GE IN cell
2200 cell imaging system.

at the cellular level, the phosphorylation
status of CDK1, which is a substrate of CDC25s, was analyzed by western
blotting (Figure 4).
Inhibition of CDC25B should induce hyperphosphorylation of the CDK1
protein, resulting in the deactivation of CDK1 kinase and cell-cycle
arrest.73,74 In the vehicle control, CDK1 proteins were
dephosphorylated, and no change occurred in the total amount of CDK1
proteins. In accordance with the results of the cell-cycle analysis
and inhibitory activity for CDC25s in vitro, compound 3w inhibited the dephosphorylation of CDK1 (Figure 4), whereas 3j and 3n did not inhibit the dephosphorylation of CDK1. These results indicated
that 3w acted as a CDC25B inhibitor at the cellular level.
However, compounds (3i and 3n) with small
differences in the chemical structure have no markedly influence on
the effect of inhibition of the dephosphorylation of the CDK1 protein.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an environmentally
benign protocol
for the synthesis of fluorinated 2-alkylthio-4-amino-quinazolines 3, under microwave irradiation conditions, using basic alumina
as the solid support as well as a base catalyst. The protocol has
a relatively broad isothiourea substrate scope and offers some significant
advantages, such as improved energy efficiency, low cost, easy availability
of the solid support, elimination of the use of any base or hazardous
solvent, and applicability toward gram-scale synthesis. The biological
activity of the 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazolines as CDC25B inhibitors
was explored for the first time. Most target compounds exhibited excellent
inhibitory activity against CDC25B as well as good antitumor activity.
Thus, the fluorinated 2-alkylthio-4-aminoquinazoline series provides
an attractive new combinatorial library of 4-aminoquinazolines for
additional analysis and optimization.

Experimental Section
General
Methods
All compounds were fully characterized
by spectroscopic data. The NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Ascend
III 600 (1H: 600 MHz, 13C: 150 MHz) or Bruker
DRX500 (1H: 500 MHz, 13C: 125 MHz). Chemical
shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million, and J values are given in hertz. Deuterated DMSO-d6 was used as the solvent. IR spectra were recorded on FT-IR
Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 using a KBr pellet. The reactions were monitored
by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel GF254. The melting
points were determined on a XT-4A melting point apparatus and are
uncorrected. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were
recorded on an Agilent LC/MSD TOF instrument. Column chromatography
was performed on a silica gel (200–300 mesh). X-ray diffraction
was obtained by APEX DUO. All microwave-assisted reactions were performed
in a commercially available multimode microwave reactor (XH-100A,
100–1000 W, Beijing Xianhu Science and Technology Development
Co. Ltd, Beijing, P. R. China). The temperature of the reaction mixture
was measured by an immersed platinum resistance thermometer. Aluminum
oxide (basic, FCP, 200–300 mesh) was purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).

Compounds 1 were purchased from TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd. Compounds 2 were prepared according to the literature.57,58 All the other chemicals used in the experiment were purchased in
analytical purity and were used without further purification.

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 3
A
mixture of polyfluoro benzenedicarbonitriles 1 (1 mmol)
and isothiouronium salts 2 (1.3 mmol) was
dissolved in a minimum amount of 95% ethanol, which was then added
to a round-bottomed flask, and basic alumina (2 g, FCP, 200–300
mesh) was added to it. The ethanol was evaporated to dryness under
reduced pressure. The reaction mixture was subjected to irradiation
in a microwave reactor (XH-100A Beijing XianHu Science, Beijing, China)
at 80 or 120 °C (600 W) for the times reported in Tables 2 and 3. The reaction was monitored by TLC. The crude products were directly
purified by column chromatography using petroleum ether/ethyl acetate
(4:1) to produce 3 with a yield of 62–93%. The
products were further identified by Fourier transform infrared, NMR,
and HRMS analyses.
