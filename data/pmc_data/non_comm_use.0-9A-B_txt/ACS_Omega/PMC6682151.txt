A cross-linked
catalyst organic framework was prepared by an alternating

catalyzed by RuCl2(=CHPh)(PCy3)2 in the presence of a BaSO4 support. The heterogenized
catalyst hydrogenated methyl benzoate at a similar rate to the homogeneous
catalyst (0.0025 mol % catalyst, 10 mol % KOtBu, 80 °C, 50 atm, tetrahydrofuran, 21 h, ∼15 000
turnovers during the first 1 h). The catalyst was used five times
for a total of 121 680 turnovers. A study on the reusability
of this catalyst showed that ester hydrogenations with bifunctional
catalysts slow as the reaction proceeds. This inhibition is removed
by isolating and reusing the catalyst, suggesting that future catalyst
design should emphasize avoiding product inhibition.

Introduction
We report a cross-linked,
reusable polymeric catalyst for ester
hydrogenations under mild conditions. Catalytic hydrogenation is an
atom-economic alternative to the stoichiometric reduction of esters
using main-group hydride reagents.1,2 The first ester
hydrogenation catalysts were heterogeneous copper chromite species3−5 that required harsh conditions (250–300 °C, 130–200
atm H2) and high catalyst loadings (∼10 wt %).6 Current heterogeneous7 ester hydrogenation catalyst systems are more active and include
Ru–ZrO2,8 Ru–Sn,9,10 Ru–Ge,11 and Ag–Au12 bimetallic systems (typical conditions: 30–50
atm H2, 140–300 °C).12 The first homogeneous catalysts were ruthenate complexes that hydrogenated
activated esters under moderately forcing conditions (10–100%
conv., 0.6 mol % Ru, 90 °C, 6.1 atm, toluene, 4–20 h).13 The Milstein group reported a breakthrough in
2006 with the ruthenium PNN pincer compound [(PNN)RuH(CO)] [PNN =
6-(di-t-butylphosphinomethylene)-2-(N,N-diethylaminomethyl)-1,6-dihydropyridine] that
hydrogenated a number of esters with turnover numbers (TONs) ranging
from 82 to 100 (5.3 atm H2, 1 mol % catalyst, 4–12
h, 115 °C).14 Saudan et al. reported
shortly thereafter that trans-[RuCl2(Ph2PCH2CH2NH2)2]
and related ruthenium-based bifunctional catalysts hydrogenate a variety
of esters with TONs as high as 9900 under practical conditions in
the presence of base [0.01–0.05 mol % catalyst, 5 mol % NaOMe,
100 °C, 49 atm H2, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1–4
h].15 Many ester hydrogenation catalysts
have been developed since these discovery reports. The more active
catalysts in the literature contain Ru6,16−23 or Os24 metal centers, the most active
hydrogenate esters with TONs ranging between 49 000 and 91 000
(typical conditions: 0.001–0.002 mol % catalyst, 2–10
mol % alkoxide base, 25–80 °C, 49–100 atm).25−28

Milstein and co-workers reported the first iron-based catalyst mer-[(2,6-(tBu2PCH2)2C5H3N)Fe(H)2(CO)] for
ester hydrogenations in 2014.29 This catalyst
hydrogenated 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl trifluoroacetate with TONs up to
1280 (0.05 mol % catalyst, 1 mol % KOtBu, 40 °C, 10 atm H2, 1,4-dioxane, 90 h). Several
groups have since then developed with earth-abundant metal centers,
including Co,30−32 Fe,33−36 and Mn.37−40 These systems are highly promising, with TONs ranging from tens
to a few hundreds (30–50 atm H2, 70–120 °C).
Jones et al. have recently reported 3890 turnovers for the hydrogenation
of the lactone γ-valerolactone with a cobalt catalyst [(HN(CH2CH2PCy2)2)Co(CH2SiMe3)]BAr4F (0.01 mol % Co, 54
atm, 120 °C, 72 h, neat).41

Another strategy to lower the cost and toxicity of homogeneous
catalysts is to immobilize them by covalent bonding to polymers and
dedrimers.42−66 There are a number of reports describing polymerized Ru catalysts
for the hydrogenations and transfer hydrogenations of ketones.67−69 For example,69 a mesoporous, polystyrene-based,
self-supported RuCl(p-cymene) (TsDPEN) [TsDPEN =
(1R,2R)-N-p-tosyl-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine] complex catalyzed the
transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone over 14 runs (total TON ∼
1300) without significant loss in activity or enantioselectivity [enantiomeric
excess (ee) = 93–94%, 1 mol % Ru per run, 500 mol% HCOONa,
40 °C, H2O, 1.5 h per run]. Our group previously reported
a highly reusable Ru–BINAP [BINAP = 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl]
catalyst–polymer framework that was cross-linked with the Ru–BINAP
monomer.70 The framework was synthesized
with an alternating ring-opening metathesis polymerization (alt-ROMP)
and supported on BaSO4. The BINAP ligand was modified at
the 5 and 5′ positions with ROMP-active norimido groups, thereby
allowing the Ru-(5,5-dinorimido)BINAP monomer to cross-link the polymer
to build a framework. The solid catalyst operated continuously over
25 runs (TON = 1000 per run) for the enantioselective hydrogenation
of 1′-acetonaphthone (0.1 mol % Ru, 2 mol % KOtBu, 40 °C, 10 atm H2 pressure, 2-PrOH,
21 h) without loss in activity (100% yield) or enantioselectivity
(95% ee). The leaching of this catalyst in any representative run
analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
was <0.016% of the total Ru loading. The reaction stopped after
34 runs because the solid catalyst accumulated on the roof of the
bomb. Several alt-ROMP Rh71,72 and Ru73 polymeric systems have been reported by our group.

To our knowledge, there is one report of a polymer-based catalyst
for the hydrogenation of esters. Kamer and co-workers immobilized
the tridentate PNN ligand ((2-C5H4N)CH2NHCH2CH2P(Ph)CH2-polymer) on Merrifield
resin and then metallated it by reaction with RuCl2(PPh3)3.74 This polymer hydrogenated
methyl benzoate with ∼75 TON per run for three runs (0.9 mol
% Ru, 10 mol % KOtBu, 40 °C, 49 atm,
THF, 2 h). The TON of the fourth run dropped to 50 TON.

Ruthenium
complexes with tetradentate PNNP ligands are active catalysts
for a variety of enantioselective reactions, including hydrogenations
and transfer hydrogenations of ketones,75 epoxidations of olefins,76 Diels–Alder
reactions,77 and cyclopropanations.78 Saudan et al.15 reported
that the Ru–PNNP complex trans-RuCl2{N,N′-bis({(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl}methylidene)ethylenediamine}
(1) is active for ester hydrogenations (0.05 mol % 1, 5 mol % NaOMe, 100 °C, 49 atm H2, THF,
1 h, TON = 1980). Although 1 does not contain N–H
groups, it is quite reasonable to expect that the imine groups are
reduced to the corresponding amines during the initial stages of the
hydrogenation.15,79 We now report a facile synthesis
of an ROMP-active Ru–PNNP analogue of 1, its polymerization
by alt-ROMP, and its performance as a reusable catalyst for ester
hydrogenations.

Results and Discussion
As shown
in Scheme 1, we prepared
an ROMP-active analogue of 1 by condensing
the known diamine, trans-5-norbornene-endo-2,3-diamine (2),80 with
2 equiv 2-diphenylphosphinobenzaldehyde to give the norbornene-containing
PNNP tetradentate ligand N,N′-bis({(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl}methylidene)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-diamine
(3). Reaction between 3 and trans-RuCl2(NBD)Py281 (4, NBD = 2,5-norbornadiene, Py = pyridine) gave the trans-dichloride 5 in 53% yield after purification. Figure 1 shows the solid-state
structure of 5 as determined by X-ray diffraction. The
solid-state structure confirms the trans-configuration of the chlorides,
as is similar to the reported structures for these types of compounds.15,75,79

probability level. Hydrogen atoms are shown with arbitrarily small
thermal parameters, except for aromatic group hydrogens, which are
not shown.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of 3 and 5
We found that ROMP
polymerization of 5 with RuCl2(=CHPh)(PCy3)2 (6) as catalyst was very slow (5
mol % 6, 40 °C,
CH2Cl2), presumably because there was too much
crowding between adjacent monomers in the polymer. Instead, we employed
alt-ROMP to polymerize 5.70,73 Briefly, alt-ROMP
occurs between a crowded, strained monomer and an uncrowded, unstrained
monomer. The more reactive, strained monomer reacts with the metathesis
catalyst, but does not polymerize because the resulting ruthenium
alkylidene is too crowded. Instead, the akylidene reacts with the
less crowded monomer, typically cis-cyclooctene (COE)
to generate a new, uncrowded alkylidene. This uncrowded alkylidene
then reacts with the crowded, strained monomer and so on.70,73 We found that 4 equiv of COE smoothly underwent alt-ROMP with 5 employing 1 mol % 6 as catalyst (40 °C,
20 h, CD2Cl2). Figure 2 shows the structures and NMR spectra of 5 and the resulting linear polymer 7. The signals
for the bridging methylene and olefin groups in 5, as
well as those for the olefin group in COE were absent in the 1H NMR spectrum of the polymer. The 31P NMR spectrum
of the polymer contained major and minor broadened peaks, shifted
∼2 ppm from those of 5. We believe the slight
shift resulted from ring opening during alt-ROMP, and the major and
minor species arise from the trans- and cis-olefin geometries in the polymer.

Figure 2 Alt-ROMP polymerization of 5 and COE; the NMR spectra
of 5 and the linear polymer 7.

Attempts to immobilize the polymeric catalyst 7 by
depositing it as film on BaSO4, as we did previously with
the highly cross-linked 5,5′-bis(norimido)BINAP–Ru polymer
framework,70 were met with mixed results.
Specifically, we evaluated 7/BaSO4 with the
hydrogenation of methyl benzoate in THF (0.1 mol % Ru in 7, 10 mol % KOtBu, 40 °C, 50 atm,
THF, 4 h, eq 1) 1  THF is often the solvent in which homogeneous
ester hydrogenations operate with the highest rates and yields.25,26,28 Although the first run reached
95% conversion (TON = 950), the filtrate was deeply colored and the
conversion of the second run was significantly lower (65%). Not surprisingly,
the solubility of the linear polymer 7 limited its isolation
and reuse by filtration.

We expect that it is difficult to prevent
polymers from dissolving
under continuous stirring at 80 °C in THF at 21 h per run. We
therefore prepared the cross-linking agent 8 (Scheme 2) in one step by
condensation of 2 equiv of cis-5-norbornene-endo-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride with ethylenediamine in
acetic acid. The ROMP polymerization of 8 catalyzed by 6 was sluggish in CH2Cl2 at 40 °C.
Presumably, the crowding around the olefin in the endo-norbornimide groups hindered the polymerization. The cross-linker 8 did, however, undergoes alt-ROMP with 5 and
COE. The optimized ratio of 5/8/COE/6 was 1:2:8:0.02. A 2:1 ratio of 5/8 was employed to form a highly cross-linked polymer to minimize dissolution
in hot THF. This mixture underwent complete polymerization after 48
h in CD2Cl2 at 40 °C. NMR spectra were
recorded, while the alt-ROMP was underway, which showed that the olefin
groups in 5 and 8 polymerized at comparable
rates. Specifically, 21% of 5, 9% of the norimido groups
in 8, and 5% of COE had polymerized after 1.5 h. The
corresponding conversions were 89, 61, and 21% after 20 h. Both 5 and 8 were almost fully consumed after 48 h,
with ∼20% COE remaining in solution. The comparable rates for
polymerization of 5 and 8 indicate that
the resulting polymer more resembles an alternating copolymer rather
than alternating blocks of 5 or 8. Further,
it is highly improbable that the cross-linked product is a linear,
ladder polymer. It is more likely a three-dimensional framework cross-linked
by 8 and spaced by COE + 5. The 1H NMR spectrum of the framework contained highly broadened peaks
and did not contain signals from the olefin or bridging methylene
groups arising from unreacted monomers. The peaks for 5 in the 31P NMR spectrum of the polymer (Figure 3) were broadened and shifted
upfield by ∼2.1 ppm from those of the unreacted monomer. After
∼40 h reaction, the entire reaction mixture had converted into
a uniform, static gel that could not be dissolved in CD2Cl2. This gel shrank to a compact, brittle piece of insoluble
plastic upon evaporation of the solvent.

and COE with 2 mol % 6 (40
°C in CD2Cl2). Spectrum of (a) initial,
(b) 1.5 h, (c) 20 h, and (d) 48 h.

Scheme 2 Preparation of the Cross-Linked Polymeric Catalyst 9 Dispersed on BaSO4
In previous reports,70,73 we utilized
an inert,
high-surface-area material such as BaSO4 to support the
polymerized catalysts. The functions of the support were to improve
mass transport, to engender mechanical stability for long-term batch
reactions with stirring, and to act as a filtration aid. The cross-linked
polymer gel 5/8/COE could not be diluted
or dissolved after it formed, and so could not be deposited onto the
BaSO4 by simple solvent evaporation. Instead, we carried
out the alt-ROMP polymerization of 5, 8,
COE, and 6 directly in the presence of BaSO4. Specifically, a solution of 5, 8, COE,
and 6 was mixed with solid BaSO4, with the
reaction solution just covering the BaSO4. The polymerization
was allowed to proceed for 66 h heating at 40 °C. The resulting
catalyst–polymer framework on BaSO4 (9, Scheme 2) was ground
with a mortar and pestle, washed with CH2Cl2, and dried under vacuum. An NMR study confirmed that ∼7%
of the Ru leached into the wash, presumably as lower-molecular-weight
oligomers.

We hydrogenated methyl benzoate with loadings of
40 000
equiv per run to evaluate 9 (0.0025 mol % Ru in 9, 10 mol % KOtBu, 80 °C,
50 atm, THF, 21 h, eq 2). These conditions are in line with those utilized for high TON
ester hydrogenations in the literature.23−26 The product mixtures contained
methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, and the transesterification product
benzyl benzoate (Table S1). The TON of
the first run was 32 960, corresponding to 82% conversion.
The isolated yield after filtration was 30 340 TON using an
internal standard. Based on the pressure drop, the hydrogenation was
very rapid in the beginning, completing ∼15 000 turnovers
(TO) during the first 1 h, ∼20 000 after 3 h, and ∼33 000
after 21 h. Similar initial burst activities were reported for homogeneous
ester hydrogenations.16,26,39,82 We found that a control homogeneous hydrogenation
of methyl benzoate with the monomeric catalyst 5 (methyl
benzoate/KOtBu/5 = 25 000:2500:1,
90 °C, 50 atm) proceeded with a similar burst followed by a slowdown
(∼14 000 TO after 1 h, ∼16 000 after 2
h, ∼17 000 after 3 h). Although the structure of 5 is modified by the ring-opening polymerization, the similarity
in turnover frequencies between 5 and the polymer indicates
that mass transport does not significantly limit the rate of the polymerized
catalyst. Presumably, the combination of the open framework structure
of the polymer, the BaSO4 support, and the 80–90
°C THF solvent minimized mass transport effects. We suggest this
strategy be incorporated into future polymeric catalyst designs. 2  Adding more hydrogen and substrate after
the homogeneous hydrogenation had no effect on the rate after the
reaction had slowed. Thus, the slowdown is either due to product inhibition,
a decrease in basicity of the medium as the hydrogenation proceeds,
or catalyst decomposition. In contrast, the polymeric catalyst was
easily reused after filtration, and the second run proceeded with
29 720 TOs and a similar initial burst in activity. Although
some loss in activity occurred between the first and second runs,
catalyst decomposition cannot explain the decrease in rate after the
burst during the homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogenations. Further,
the hydrogenation of benzyl benzoate over 9 proceeds
in a similar yield (74%) and TON (∼29 600) to that of
methyl benzoate. Considering this similarity in reactivity, and that
only small amounts of benzyl benzoate (∼3.8%) are in the product
mixture from the hydrogenation of methyl benzoate, benzyl benzoate
does not significantly inhibit the hydrogenation of methyl benzoate.
The yield of the hydrogenation of benzyl benzoate with less base (1
mol %) was lower (40%). In our prior mechanistic studies,82,83 we directly observed that alcohols inhibit ketone and ester hydrogenations
by forming Ru-alkoxides, especially in the absence of base. We expect
that this inhibition is stronger for ester hydrogenations for two
reasons. The first is that esters are intrinsically less reactive
than ketones. The second is that the hydrogenation of a ketone forms
1 equiv of a secondary alcohol, whereas the hydrogenation of a methyl
ester forms 2 equiv of primary alcohols. Primary Ru-alkoxides are
more stable than secondary alkoxides because of steric crowding.84 We therefore expect that the buildup 2 equiv
of primary alcohols partially explains the decrease in rate over the
course of these ester hydrogenations.

In other research, we
reported two direct observations that may
explain how the excess base increases the rates of these ester hydrogenations.
The first is that base removes alkoxide ligands from these types of
Ru compounds by an elimination reaction involving deprotonation of
an N–H group.82−84 We therefore expect that one role of the excess base
in these ester hydrogenations is to minimize the inhibition by the
2 equiv of primary alcohol products through this elimination reaction.
In another study, we showed that the reducing power of these catalysts
is dramatically increased by deprotonation of a N–H group.
For example, we observed that the deprotonated version of Noyori’s
prototypal dihydride catalyst, (BINAP)Ru(H)2(NH(−)CH(Ph)CH(Ph)NH2), reduces imides on mixing at −80
°C in THF.85 We propose that the combination
of these two processes partially explains the need for excess base
during active ester hydrogenations. For studies on the ester hydrogenation,
see refs (86−90). Also, the basicity of these ester hydrogenations decreases as the
medium changes from pure aprotic (THF + ester) to a protic medium
as the 2 equiv of alcohol products form. This decrease in basicity
would limit the alkoxide elimination, the catalyst activation, and
the deprotonation of the N–H groups. We propose that the combination
of primary alcohol product inhibition and the decrease in reaction
medium’s basicity all contribute to the drop in rate after
the initial burst in these ester hydrogenations. We suggest that the
design of high-turnover-number ester hydrogenation catalysts in the
future incorporates methods to minimize these types of inhibition.

Figure 4 plots TON
versus run. The TONs of the first two runs were similar. The catalyst
remained active in the subsequent runs, but gradually slowed. Run
5 proceeded with 14 760 TO, with a total over the five runs
= 121 680, the highest TON reported for the hydrogenation of
an ester with a molecular catalyst.24−27

Figure 4 Turnovers per run, and total TON over
five hydrogenations of methyl
benzoate (0.0025 mol % catalyst, 10 mol % KOtBu, 80 °C, 50 atm, THF, 21 h).

The amounts of Ru leached during runs 1–4 were 5.6,
3.8,
1.4, and 1.1%, respectively, of the total catalyst loading, as determined
by ICP-MS. These results show that although leaching was reduced by
the cross-linked polymer, it was not eliminated. These results demonstrated
the heterogeneity of the catalyst. Specifically, if the activity resulted
from dissolved Ru complexes leached into solution, run 4 occurred
with an impossibly high ∼2 million TON. The Ru leaching can
be attributed to either/both dissolution of lower-molecular-weight
oligomers over 21 h stirring in 80 °C THF per run and/or some
sort of active site decomposition. Further studies are required to
study the mechanism of decomposition. Regardless, the total loss in
Ru to leaching was only 11.9%, much less than the 55% drop in activity
between run 1 and run 5. We speculate that the gradual drop in activity
over the five runs was due mainly to some sort of decomposition of
the catalyst that did not release Ru out of the polymer framework.
This long-term decomposition was either innate to the catalyst under
these conditions, or it was caused by trace amounts of systematic
impurities.

Conclusions
We devised a convenient synthesis of a
defined, dispersed Ru–PNNP
cross-linked catalyst–polymer framework utilizing alt-ROMP.
The highest reported total TON for the hydrogenation of an ester was
obtained by reusing the catalyst. The catalyst had similar activity
to a homogeneous analogue, indicating mass transport did not limit
the activity. The study of this system provided insights into the
mechanism of catalyst deactivation, how to minimize mass transport
limitations, and guidelines for future catalyst design. Further research
is underway in these laboratories to improve the TON, to further minimize
leaching, and to prepare resolved versions of this chiral catalyst.

Experimental
Section
General Information
Unless stated otherwise, all of
the synthetic experiments were carried out under an inert atmosphere
(dinitrogen or argon), using Schlenk techniques and a glovebox. High-pressure
hydrogenations were carried out in a high-pressure Parr 4750 reactor
with an extra coned pressure fitting for adding and filtering reaction
mixtures. The gases N2 (4.8), Ar (4.8), and H2 (5.0) were supplied by Praxair. Deuterated solvents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. All common
solvents were used as received or distilled over proper drying agents
under N2 when it was necessary: CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and hexanes were distilled over CaH2; methanol was distilled over Mg/I2; EtOH was dried over
3 Å molecular sieves and distilled over CaO; and THF was purified
by distillation over Na/benzophenone. Triethylamine, pyridine, ethylenediamine,
and piperidine were distilled over CaH2. Norbornadiene
and cis-cyclooctene were purified by simple fraction
distillation. Methyl benzoate was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and
fractionally distilled over CaH2 prior to hydrogenation.
Benzyl benzoate was obtained from Acros Organics and distilled over
CaH2 under N2 gas prior to use. The following
chemicals were obtained from suppliers without further purification: trans-3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthaloyl chloride, cis-5-norbornene-endo-2,3-dicarboxylic
anhydride, and 2-diphenylphosphinobenzaldehyde were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich; NaN3 was obtained from Fisher Scientific
Company; NaBH4 were obtained from BDH Chemicals. First-generation
Grubbs catalyst was obtained from Strem Chemicals. BaSO4 (white reflectance standard) was obtained from Eastman Chemical
Co., Inc., washed with distilled CH2Cl2, dried
under vacuum, and stored under nitrogen before use.

1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded with
a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer, an Agilent/Varian 400 MHz spectrometer,
or an Agilent VNMRS 700 MHz spectrometer. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were recorded relative to tetramethylsilane using
the signals from the residual protons in the deuterated solvent as
the internal standard. 31P chemical shifts were reported
relative to an H3PO4 external standard. Elemental
analysis was carried out with a Flash 2000 Organic Elemental Analyzer
made by Thermo Fisher. ICP-MS was carried out with a PerkinElmer ’s
Elan 6000 ICP-MS.

(Racemate) (2)
This experiment was carried out
in air, and it is a modification of a literature procedure.80 The solvents were used as received, and the
potentially explosive diazide intermediate was not isolated. Warning:
this diazide may be explosive when concentrated. Do not isolate it
by removing the solvent. Proceed immediately to the next step, as
detailed in this procedure.

Acetone (7.5 mL) was added to an
Erlenmeyer flask containing trans-3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthaloyl
chloride (3.085 g, 14.1 mmol), followed by a solution of NaN3 (2.747 g, 42.2 mmol) in deionized water (7.5 mL). The mixture was
stirred for 1 h at room temperature (rt). The aqueous solution was
then extracted with toluene (3 × 25 mL), and the combined organic
solution was washed with saturated NaHCO3 (30 mL), brine
(30 mL), and dried over Na2SO4. The solution
was gravity-filtered into a round-bottom flask, refluxed for 2 h,
allowed to cool to room temperature, and 120 mL of 8 M HCl was added.
This mixture was refluxed for 4 h. Over this period, the color of
the solution slowly turned light purple. After the solution cooled
to room temperature, the aqueous layer was separated and washed with
diethyl ether (2 × 50 mL). After removing the water under vacuum,
the resulting brownish solid was washed with THF (2 × 20 mL)
and then dried under vacuum to give 1.811 g of product with a yield
of 65%.

(Racemate) (3)
This synthesis was carried out
under N2. Compound 2 (248.6 mg, 1.26 mmol
assuming no water uptake) was weighed into a Schlenk tube along with
3 Å molecular sieves (565.6 mg, activated). The tube was degassed,
then triethylamine (700 μL) and EtOH (5 mL) were added. 2-Diphenylphosphinobenzaldehyde
(731.6 mg, 2.52 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (12 mL) under gentle heating
and transferred to the Schlenk tube. The reaction was stirred for
16 h at rt. The NMR spectrum of an aliquot showed that the aldehyde
was present in 16% excess, so another 39.6 mg of diamine was added
to the reaction. After another 24 h of stirring, the reaction mixture
was filtered through Celite and pumped under high vacuum to dry. Dichloromethane
(∼10 mL) was added to dissolve the compound, and the resultant
solution was washed with water three times and then dried over Na2SO4. After filtration and drying under high vacuum,
641 mg of product was obtained with a yield of 76%.

solid was purified by a column of neutral Al2O3 (30 cm3 in bulk volume) with dichloromethane. The orange
band on the column was collected and dried under high vacuum, and
257 mg of red powdery compound was obtained after recrystallization
using dichloromethane and hexane, with a yield of 53%. Crystals for
X-ray crystallography were obtained by a diffusion recrystallization

Alt-ROMP Polymerization of 5 and COE, NMR study
Catalyst monomer 5 (10.0 mg, 0.012 mmol, 1 equiv),
COE (6.0 μL, 0.046 mmol, 4 equiv), and 6 (0.1 mg,
0.0001 mmol, 0.01 equiv) were mixed in CD2Cl2 (0.8 mL) in an NMR tube. The NMR was taken after 20 h of heating
at 40 °C.

Supported Alt-ROMP Polymer of 5 and COE
Compound 5 (21.3 mg, 0.025 mmol, 1
equiv), COE (13.2
μL, 0.100 mmol, 4 equiv), and 6 (0.2 mg, 0.00024
mmol, in standard solution) were mixed in 0.8 mL of CD2Cl2. The polymerization was completed after 48 h at 40
°C. The resulting polymer was diluted to 2 mL with DCM and then
transferred to a slurry of BaSO4 (3.76 g) in DCM (20 mL).
The slurry was stirred for 30 min, then slowly pumped under high vacuum
to remove the solvent, resulting a pink powder. The powder was washed
with MeOH three times and then dried under high vacuum. The MeOH wash
was collected and analyzed using 1H NMR with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene
as internal standard, indicating 53% of COE and 14% of Ru moiety dissolved
in the MeOH. We suspect that these are lower-molecular-weight oligomers.
The resulting supported catalyst had a loading of 0.0058 mmol Ru/g
BaSO4.

Hydrogenation with Supported Linear Polymer
Catalyst (Two Runs)
The hydrogenation was carried out in
a high-pressure reactor. For
the first run, 1.88 g of methyl benzoate (1.35 mL, 1000 equiv) was
added to the reactor through a cannula, followed by supported catalyst
(0.0107 mol Ru, 1 equiv, slurry in THF) and KOtBu (120 mg, 100 equiv, THF solution) through a cannula, with
12 mL of THF in total. The reactor was sealed and pressurized. After
4 h at 50 atm H2 under 40 °C, the reaction was stopped
and filtered through a cannula filter under H2. The next
run was set up by adding methyl benzoate (1.35 mL, 1000 equiv) and
KOtBu (120 mg, 100 equiv) in THF (12 mL)
and the hydrogenation was carried out under the same conditions.

The filtrate from each run was pumped to dryness with a rotovap.
Water (15 mL) was added to the mixture and the mixture was extracted
with diethyl ether twice. The ether layer was dried over Na2SO4 and the ether was removed with a rotovap. The conversions
were determined by the ratio between each compound in the 1H NMR spectra.

Cross-Linked Polymerization Study in an NMR
Tube
Compound 5 (11.0 mg, 0.013 mmol, 1 equiv),
compound 8 (8.8
mg, 0.025 mmol, 2 equiv), and first-generation Grubbs catalyst solution
(0.22 mg catalyst, 0.00026 mmol, 0.02 equiv, quantified with a standard
solution in CD2Cl2) were placed in three separate
NMR tubes under N2. They were transferred into the same
NMR tube after dissolving the solids in CD2Cl2; the total volume after mixing was 0.7 mL. cis-Cyclooctene
(11.3 mg, 0.103 mol, 8 equiv) was added to the NMR tube, and NMR spectra
of the reaction solution were recorded immediately. The tube was placed
in a 40 °C oil bath, and the NMR spectra were recorded after
1.5, 20, and 48 h. The reaction solution slowly turned into a gel
in ∼40 h, which could not flow anymore (Figure S1). However, the solution NMR spectra were still available
with the gel.

Polymerization in the Presence of BaSO4 To Make the
Immobilized Catalyst (9)
The experiment was
carried out under N2. A polymerization solution was prepared
first as described above. It contained the following chemicals: 5 (21.2 mg, 0.025 mmol, 1 equiv), 8 (17.7 mg,
0.049 mmol, 2 equiv), 6 (0.4 mg, 0.00049 mmol, 0.02 equiv,
quantified with a standard solution in CD2Cl2), cis-cyclooctene (22.2 mg, 0.201 mmol, 8 equiv),
and 1.3 mL CD2Cl2. An NMR spectrum was recorded
to confirm the ratio between each compound. Most (90%) of this solution
was transferred into a screwcap Schlenk tube with 4.0133 g of BaSO4 inside, and 10% was left in the NMR tube as an indicator
of the reaction process. Both the Schlenk tube and the NMR tube were
placed in a 40 °C oil bath. The 10% solution in the NMR tube
became a gel within 40 h. The reaction in the Schlenk tube was stopped
after 66 h to make sure that the reaction had ended as it could not
be monitored directly. The CD2Cl2 was removed
under high vacuum, and then the solid was ground with a mortar and
pestle in a glovebox. Big chunks were broken into powder, and the
powder was ground as fine as possible. The resultant powder was washed
with distilled DCM (3 × 20 mL), and 3.827 g of supported catalyst
was recovered after drying (some could not be recovered from the mortar).
A picture of the powdery supported catalyst is shown in Figure S2. The wash was collected, and the DCM
was removed under high vacuum. The residue was dissolved in CDCl3 with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene and triphenylphosphine as internal
standards. NMR spectra confirmed that 0.0015 mmol Ru complex leached
out into the wash, corresponding to 6.6% of the total Ru initially
in the Schlenk tube. The loading of the resulting supported catalyst
was calculated as follows: [90% × 0.025 mmol × (3.827 g/4.013
g) – 0.0015 mmol]/3.827 g = 0.0053 mmol Ru/g BaSO4.

Catalytic Hydrogenation Experiments
Catalytic Hydrogenation
with Reusing the Catalyst
The
whole process was carried out under Ar or H2, and all of
the transfers were carried out using a cannula. The reaction was carried
out in a high-pressure reactor with an extra pressure fitting where
addition and filtration could be conducted. The reactor was assembled
with a glass liner and a stir bar, then purged with Ar. The reactor
was pressurized to 50 atm with H2, evacuated, and purged
with Ar again. Using Schlenk techniques, the supported catalyst 9 (0.2833 g, 0.0015 mmol Ru) was transferred with methyl benzoate
(8.08 g, 7.48 mL, 59.4 mmol) as slurry to the reactor under Ar, followed
by KOtBu (665.4 mg, 5.9 mmol) solution
in THF (16 mL). The reactor was sealed and pressurized gradually to
50 atm, and the valve on the reactor was closed to isolate it from
the H2 tank. The oil bath placed underneath was set to
80 °C, and the stirring speed was 600 rpm. (Note that the reactor
would be repressurized if the pressure dropped below 40 atm as the
reaction proceeded.) After 21 h, the reactor was cooled to rt and
the pressure was slowly released. The reaction mixture was filtered
through a cannula filter into a preweighed flask under H2 atmosphere, and once bubbles appeared from the cannula tip, the
filtration was stopped. To set up the next run, methyl benzoate (8.08
g, 7.48 mL, 59.4 mmol) was added to the reactor immediately after
the filtration, followed by KOtBu (665.4
mg, 5.9 mmol) solution in THF (16 mL). The reactor was pressurized
and heated as described above, and this process was repeated for multiple
runs. The collected filtrate was weighed with a flask, and the NMR
spectra of a weighed aliquot of the filtrate were recorded in CDCl3, with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as the internal standard to
calculate the conversion and yield. The details of each hydrogenation
run are listed in Table S1. Figure S3 is
an example of the 1H NMR spectrum of this hydrogenation
(run 1).

A white solid was found in the bomb on completion of
the reaction. After the last run (run 5), the reaction mixture was
cannulated into a side-arm flask under N2, and a filtration
was carried out to isolate the product. The remaining solid was washed
with dry ether, and the organic compounds in the wash were combined
with the filtrate of run 5. Next, the solid was pumped to dry under
high vacuum, and 0.714 g of white powder was isolated. Its NMR results
confirmed the solid to be potassium benzoate with the remaining catalyst/BaSO4 powder (0.283 g BaSO4 would remain theoretically),
without anything else visible in the NMR spectra.

A hydrogenation
process was carried out by the same procedure using
benzyl benzoate as substrate (12.63 g, 0.059 mol). The reaction proceeded
in 74% yield, ∼29 600 turnovers. Figure S18 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of the product
mixture.

Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Methyl Benzoate
Compound 5 (1.25 mg, 0.0015 mmol, 1 equiv), methyl
benzoate (4.6 mL,
36.9 mmol, 25 000 equiv), and KOtBu (419 mg, 3.71 mmol) were added into a high-pressure reactor with
16 mL of THF. The hydrogenation was carried out at 90 °C under
50 atm H2. The approximate TON within each hour was monitored
using a pressure gauge, which was ∼14 000 turnovers
after 1 h, ∼16 000 after 2 h, and ∼16 700
after 3 h. The reaction was stopped after 3 h by cooling and releasing
the H2 pressure. A tiny aliquot was taken under H2, and its NMR spectra confirmed a conversion of 72%, corresponding
to 18 000 turnovers. Then, another 18 000 equiv methyl
benzoate (3.3 mL) was added to the reactor. The reaction was brought
back to 90 °C and 50 atm H2. The pressure drop of
the first hour after replenishing the substrate indicated that the
TON was less than 1000.
