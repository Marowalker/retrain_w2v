==== Body
In the original
paper, the time-resolved
emission spectra (TRES) were corrected for the wavelength detection
efficiency of the wrong detector. (A malfunctioning photomultiplier
tube (PMT) was replaced with a newer, different model.) Here we present
the correct TRES data with the right correction file of the actual
new PMT used in the experiment. The correction has no impact on the
conclusions of the paper. The mistake only slightly affected the shape
and position of the TRES (Figure 7). We apologize for the oversight.

Figure 7 Correct TRES for Figure 7A,C.

Corrections
to Table 1 in manuscript:green
emitter: TRES shift = 359.21 cm–1

red emitter: TRES shift = 230.78 cm–1
