Lithium-ion batteries are widely
used in the field of new energy
vehicles and energy storage. Understanding the electrode reaction
of lithium-ion batteries is the key to improve their cycle life and
safety. Direct measurement of thermodynamic data of the electrode
reaction is a practical, economical, and nondestructive method for
electrode characterization. In this paper, the open-circuit voltage
of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell
is measured at different discharge states and different temperatures.
The dE/dT–SOD (state of discharge)
relation curves are fitted linearly by the least square method, and
the entropy change values of different SODs are calculated. Finally,
the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change of different SODs are obtained.
The electrode reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 in different SODs was discussed by the entropy change in
different SODs. According to the evolution trend of ΔS, the lithium intercalation reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 may be a single-phase solid solution
reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. Finally, the reversible
heat generation at different current values and SODs are calculated.

1 Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in
the field of new energy
vehicles and energy storage.1,2 The cycle life and safety
of lithium-ion batteries are the most concerned issues.3−5 In order to improve the cycle life, it is necessary to understand
the mechanism of the electrode reaction and decay.6,7 For
safety concerns, one of the important issues is improving the battery
design.8 The design improvement requires
better understanding of the heat generation behavior of batteries
in charging and discharging, which is determined by the characteristics
of the electrode material itself.9−11

Currently, many
in situ characterization methods are used to understand
the electrode reaction and decay mechanism of lithium-ion batteries.12−16 However, these characterization methods often need to be combined
with specially designed cell models and electrode materials with special
morphology, which is not convenient in many cases. Therefore, direct
measurement of the thermodynamic data of the electrode reaction is
a practical and economic means of electrode characterization, which
is often ignored by material researchers.17 The measurement of electrode reaction and thermodynamic parameters
is carried out in the half-cell or the full-cell. The whole measurement
process has a little disturbance to the battery, so it can be considered
to be a nondestructive in situ battery detection method. In other
words, commercial lithium-ion batteries can be detected in situ without
damage. In addition, thermodynamic characterization can be used not
only to characterize the thermal properties of various electrode materials
but also to characterize the structural changes and electrode reactions
in the process of charging and discharging.18 It is a powerful method to study the cycle life and safety of batteries.9,19

The three most important thermodynamic parameters of the electrode
reaction are Gibbs free energy G, entropy S, and enthalpy H. The change in Gibbs
free energy ΔG is the maximum work of the battery.
The change in lattice order is characterized by the change in entropy
ΔS. The enthalpy change ΔH is the reaction heat of the electrochemical reaction. These three
parameters can be measured by electrochemical tests and eqs 1–320 1   2   3  where n is the number of
electrons transfer per formula, F is the Faraday
constant, E is the standard electromotive force [also
known as open-circuit potential (OCV)] of the battery reaction, T is the temperature, and P is the pressure.

Item (∂E/∂T)P, here referred to dE/dT, is determined by measuring the OCV of the electrochemical
cell at different temperatures. Ideally, the cell needs to be relaxed
for a period of time before the open-circuit voltage is measured to
reach equilibrium. The entropy change in the electrochemical reaction
can be obtained by measuring the change in open-circuit voltage at
different temperatures and calculated using eq 2.21 The increase
or decrease in entropy means the decrease or increase in the degree
of order of the lithium ion in the lattice, respectively. More importantly,
the entropy change can also affect the thermal behavior of electrochemical
reaction and then change the temperature of the battery, which greatly
affects the performance of lithium-ion batteries.9

The total heat generation of the Li-ion battery can
be calculated
using eq 4(22) 4  where I is the current value
(the discharge current is determined to be negative here), Ri is the internal resistance of the battery,
and ΔS is the entropy change. Negative Q means exothermic reaction in which heat is transferred
from the battery. On the contrary, positive Q indicates
an endothermic reaction. Qirreversible is always negative and only related to current and internal resistance.
The positivity and negativity of Qreversible depend on the symbol of ΔS and current.23 The sum of Qirreversible and Qreversible determines the symbol
and size of Qtotal, that is, the total
amount of heat generated by the battery. For example, when ΔS is negative and I is negative in the
discharge process, −I2Ri and −TΔSI/nF are both negative values and Qtotal is negative. In the charging process, I is positive, so −TΔSI/nF is positive and −I2Ri is negative; thus, the positive
and negative symbols of Qtotal are determined
by the larger absolute values of the two items.

In the process
of charging and discharging, the concentration of
the lithium ion in the solid phase of the electrode material is dynamic.
According to eq 2, ΔS is a state function independent of the process, that is
to say, it is not affected by the charging and discharging process
and only changes with the concentration of the lithium ion. The relationship
between them can be expressed by the entropy change curve. Currently,
the entropy curves of many electrode materials and full-cells have
been reported, including LixTiS2,24 LiMn2O4,25 LiCoO2,24 LixV2O5,26 graphite,27 and so
forth. With these basic physical chemistry parameters, people can
build a more accurate thermoelectric-coupled modeling,28 so as to realize the accurate prediction and
simulation of the electrochemical performance and thermal behavior
of lithium-ion batteries.29−32

LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is a typical high-voltage
cathode material with a voltage plateau as high as 4.7 V.33,34 This material has a three-dimensional lithium-ion diffusion path
and an excellent intrinsic rate performance.35,36 In addition, it has been found that there may be a two-phase coexistence
region and phase transition region in the voltage plateau, which can
be attributed to the change in the degree of order caused by the rearrangement
of Ni and Mn transition metals in the sublattice.37 However, in full-cell applications, it has been found that
the battery capacity decays faster than the commercial standard.38 The capacity fading may be due to (1) the increase
in interface impedance caused by the oxidation and decomposition of
an electrolyte; (2) the loss of the active material caused by the
dissolution of the transition metal. In addition, the stress caused
by the crystal phase transformation during the lithium removal from
the positive electrode may also cause capacity decay.39 The electrochemical thermodynamic parameters are very sensitive
to the phase transition, which is helpful to analyze the crystal phase
transition when the cathode is deintercalated with lithium and to
clarify the mechanism of smooth phase transition by doping element
modification. As of now, there is no report available on the entropy
change in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. In this
paper, we study the entropy change characteristics of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell in different states of
discharge (SODs).

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the voltage profile of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell from the third to tenth cycle in the precycle
stage at 0.1 C. It can be seen that after 10 cycles of precycling,
the interface of the electrode is gradually stable. In particular,
the discharge curve of the 4.7 V plateau is highly coincident, which
indicates that the battery is stable, and the next step of thermodynamic
parameter measurements can be carried out. It can be seen from the
figure that the discharge capacity of the 4.7 V high-voltage plateau
is about 115 mA h g–1, accounting for 80% of the
total discharge capacity, which is also the focus of this paper (compared
with a 4 V slope stage).

Figure 1 (a) Precycling voltage profiles from the third
to tenth cycle;
(b) voltage profiles before and after the OCV test for the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell at 0.1 C, 20
°C.

The SOD may change slightly after
the OCV test. Thus, if the cell
is discharged to the next specific capacity point directly, the actual
SOD may be different with the targeted point. In addition, the SOD
cannot be adjusted by potential because of the very flat plateau before
80% SOD, which leads to a big capacity change with a small potential
change, and an unacceptable SOD error. To obtain accurate SODs, the
cell is fully charged and discharged to target SOD after every OCV
tests. Figure 1b shows
the charge–discharge curve of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell before and after the OCV test. The curve
basically coincides with each other, indicating that the battery and
the electrode material structure are both stable in the whole test
process. This suggests that the above test procedure is meaningful.
The open-circuit voltage and temperature curves measured at steady
state reflect the intrinsic thermodynamic characteristics of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4.

Figure 2a–c
shows the open-circuit voltage versus time curves measured at 60,
50, and 20% SOD, respectively. Although the open-circuit voltage fluctuates
slightly at the same temperature, the change in trend can be seen.
As the temperature increases along 0, 10, 20, and 30 °C, the
open-circuit voltage decreases in turn. The open-circuit voltage at
the same temperature is taken as the middle value of the stable stage,
and the obtained temperature versus open-circuit voltage curve (Figure 2d) meets the linear
fitting condition, so (∂E/∂T)P can be obtained, and then,
ΔS can be obtained according to eq 2.

Table 1 summarizes
the open-circuit voltage, dE/dT,
ΔS, ΔG, and ΔH values of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell for different SODs at 20 °C. Figures 3 and 4 show the open-circuit voltage curve and ΔS curve of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li
half-cell for different SODs at 20 °C. It can be seen from Table 1 and Figure 4 that the ΔS value for 0–10% SOD (high-voltage lithium-deficient phase)
is almost the same. It can be inferred that it conforms to the characteristics
of first-order two-phase transformation, which is often accompanied
by large volume change, resulting in large internal stress, particle
fracture, and deterioration of cycle performance. In the range of
10–40% SOD, ΔS shows a slope change,
which indicates that the reaction in this region is closer to the
single-phase reaction of a solid solution rather than the two-phase
reaction. The 40–60% SOD region is a transition region, indicating
that there are new phases in the region, which is a multiphase coexistence
region. In the 60–80% SOD range, ΔS also
shows a slope change, indicating that the region is closer to the
reaction mechanism of a single-phase solid solution. The OCV in the
80–100% SOD range is always unstable during measurement, and
the calculation error of the mean value is large. However, it can
also be seen qualitatively that the absolute value of ΔS in this area is large, and the volume changes greatly
along with a huge amount of change in heat; therefore, this area corresponds
to the Mn4+ → Mn3+ redox couple, rather
than Ni2+ → Ni3+ → Ni4+ redox. It has been reported that the lithium intercalation reaction
is a two-phase reaction in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, corresponding to the two-half plateau high-voltage regions.37 In this paper, the intercalation is more like
a single-phase solid solution reaction based on the evolution trend
of ΔS.40 The reason
of the discrete conclusion with the previous report needs to be studied
more in the future. One possible reason may be the content of Mn3+ in the samples, as it is reported that the increase in the
degree of disorder by doping can make the ΔS get inclined to the slope.41

Using open-circuit
voltage data and eq 1, the value of ΔG under
different SODs can be calculated, and then through eq 3, the value of ΔH can be obtained. Figure 5 shows ΔG (Figure 5a) and ΔH (Figure 5b) versus SOD curves
of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell.
The value of ΔH corresponds to the heat released
by the electrochemical reaction of the battery. It is of great significance
to study the heat generation and temperature change in the process
of battery charging and discharging and then to carry out thermoelectric-coupled
simulation and predictive management of the battery system.22

Figure 5 (a) ΔG and (b) ΔH vs SOD curves of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell.

The reversible heat generation
is calculated using eq 4, as shown in Figure 6. Because ΔS is always
negative at all SODs, and I is negative in the discharge
process, −TΔSI/nF is negative, exhibiting the heating
effect. In the charging process, I is positive, so
−TΔSI/nF is positive, exhibiting the cooling effect.
The heating or cooling effect is rather strong from 80 to 90% SOD,
for the absolute value of ΔS is large, and
the structure changes severely in this range.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, the open-circuit voltage
of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell
at different discharge
states and different temperatures is measured. As temperature increases,
the open-circuit voltage decreases linearly in turn. The dE/dT–SOD relation curves are fitted
by the least square method, and the entropy change values of different
SODs are calculated based on the fitted values. The ΔS values do not change much in 0% to 80% SOD but change
dramatically when the SOD is over 80%. Further, the Gibbs free energy
and enthalpy change in different SODs are obtained. The electrode
reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 was discussed
by the entropy change in different SODs. According to the evolution
trend of ΔS, the lithium intercalation reaction
of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 may be a single-phase
solid solution reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. In this
system, the reversible heat generation shows cooling and heating effect
in the charging and discharging process, respectively.

4 Methods
4.1 Material Preparation
A LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 material was prepared by a PVP gel
combustion method. The detailed procedure can be found in our previous
report.42

4.2 Electrode
Preparation and Battery Assembly
The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, an NMP solution
in polyvinylidene fluoride, and conductive carbon black (super C)
were mixed evenly according to a mass ratio of 8:1:1, doctor-bladed
on aluminum foil, predried at 60 °C, transferred to a vacuum
drying oven, and then dried overnight at 120 °C. The dry electrode
pieces are punched into a circular electrode with a diameter of 12
mm, and the thickness is 15 μm. The CR2025 half-cells were fabricated
with the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode,
lithium foil anode, 1 mol L–1 LiPF6 in
1:1 EC/DEC as the electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 as the separator in
an argon-filled glovebox.

4.3 Electrochemical Test
The charge and
discharge performance and open-circuit voltage of different SODs were
examined by a LANHE CT2001A battery tester. The temperature is controlled
by a programmable temperature-controlled incubator. Because the volume
of the battery is very small compared with the incubator, we use the
incubator temperature to represent the battery temperature. The SOD
was adjusted by discharging at 0.1 C.

The test process consists
of the following steps:a Precycle: cycle at 20 °C, 0.03
C rate, voltage range 3.5–4.95 V for 10 cycles, and read battery
capacity information after battery charging and discharging cycle
curve is stable.

b Full
charging: charge to 4.95 V at a
constant current of 0.1 C, set as 100% state of charge, that is, 0%
SOD.

c OCV test: first,
balance the battery
at 20 °C for 20 h and record the open-circuit voltage. Then,
repeat the process at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 20 °C for 2 h at each
step.

d Adjusting SOD:
charge the cell fully
and then discharge at 0.1 C to the target SOD in one step.
