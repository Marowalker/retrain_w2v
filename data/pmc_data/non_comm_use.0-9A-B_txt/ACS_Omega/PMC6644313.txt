In this study, poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) membrane was modified through a novel approach by
first blending an active component (poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene), P(VDF-co-CTFE))
with the PVDF base material, followed by surface grafting of the membrane
on the active component to obtain a triblock copolymer functional
structure. The prepared membranes were characterized by various analyses,
including Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscope, and filtration
tests. It was found that the modified membrane surface showed a much
better hydrophilicity (water contact angle of 67.3°) and oleophobicity
(oil contact angle of 129.7°). The modification reduced the average
surface pore size (from 0.1495 to 0.1072 μm) and thus lowered
the pure water flux (from 364.0 to 224.6 L m–2 h–1 at 0.10 MPa of transmembrane pressure), but significantly
increased the relative flux recovery (RFR) and the retention efficiency
of the modified membrane during the filtration of bovine serum albumin
solution and oil/water emulsion. For example, the modified membranes
showed 98.6% oil retention (at feed concentration of 0.4 g L–1), 92.7% RFR by simple water flushing after filtration, and a consistently
high oil removal of 96% or above during a five-cycle-continuous filtration
test, as compared to 30.4% oil retention and 51.8% RFR for unmodified
PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) blend membrane.

1 Introduction
Membrane technology has become an important treatment
alternative for water and wastewater management due to its various
advantages over conventional treatment technologies.1 Among the major types of base membrane materials, poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) and its derivatives have attracted great engineering
interest in water and wastewater treatments, largely attributed to
their unique properties such as excellent thermal and chemical stability
in aqueous environment, good mechanical durability and engineering
processability, etc. arising from the high polarity (high dielectric
constant) and electron-withdrawing property of the fluorine atoms
in the backbone.2−4 However,
the surface of PVDF membrane is usually highly hydrophobic and hence
greatly susceptible to membrane organic fouling5 due to favorable interaction with many hydrophobic foulant
such as bacteria and protein in water and wastewater. Over the last
1 or 2 decades, numerous efforts have been made to improve the hydrophilicity
and antifouling properties of the PVDF membranes.6−10

Among the various different membrane modification
methods, surface grafting has been considered to be an efficient method
to improve the surface properties of membranes without destroying
and altering their inside structures,11,12 which introduces
and attaches polar groups or hydrophilic monomers onto the membrane
surface through the formation of chemical bonds. As one of the typical
surface modification methods, graft polymerization allows functional
groups to be covalently attached to the membrane substrate.13 Some hydrophilic polymers such as sulfonyl betaine
methacrylate, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
(PVP) have been grafted on PVDF membranes to improve their surface
hydrophilic properties.14−16 Although there have been many successful stories on surface-grafting
modification of PVDF membranes, the approaches generally need harsh
pretreatment or even severe chemical reaction conditions, especially
for the relatively inert base membrane material such as PVDF.17,18 This has, to some extent, limited its practical engineering application
for membrane preparations.

Membrane surface modification may
also be done through polymer blending.19−21 Zhu et al. reported the preparation of modified PVDF
membrane with superhydrophilic and superoleophobic surface property.22,23 In that work, a triblock copolymer P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG with both hydrophilic and
oleophobic groups was synthesized from a PVDF derivative, P(VDF-co-CTFE),24,25 and a fluorinated polyethylene
(fPEG), and the copolymer was used as an additive polymer to blend
with PVDF to prepare the desired membrane. The hydrophilic segments
(poly(methyl acrylic acid), PMAA groups) can help the formation of
a hydration layer on the membrane surface that may inhibit the nonspecific
interaction between the foulants and the membrane surface, and the
oleophobic segments (fPEG groups) with low surface free energy can
reduce the adsorption or adhesion strength of the organic substances
(such as protein) onto the membrane surfaces, which make them easily
removable even by water flushing only. The blending method can provide
a unified membrane with relatively strong mechanical properties, but
the prepared membrane may greatly be affected by the compatibility
between the base membrane and additive materials, as well as by the
solubility of the additive compounds. The molecular weights of PVDF
and the synthesized triblock copolymer P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG are quite different from
each other, and the PVDF backbone has been modified obviously by the
linked chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), PMAA, and fPEG segments, which
may lead to bad thermodynamic compatibility and give a low miscibility.26−29 Comparably,
there is no big difference in the structures and molecular weights
between the copolymer P(VDF-co-CTFE) and PVDF, which
may result in a relative good compatibility.

In this study,
a new approach is developed by combining the advantages and overcoming
the shortcomings from the surface-grafting and polymer-blending approaches
for PVDF membrane modification. Instead of first synthesizing an additive
and then blending it with PVDF (as reported by Zhu), the starting
polymer P(VDF-co-CTFE) was first blended with PVDF
to provide active component for subsequent surface grafting of fPEG
onto the prepared membrane. Compared to conventional surface-graft
modification, the presence of the active component in the membrane
structure made the surface-grafting reaction less demanding. The blended
active component can also provide the flexibility for controlling
the surface-grafting density. Compared to traditional blending approach,
the use of starting polymer of P(VDF-co-CTFE) for
blending with PVDF increased its compatibility and solubility with
PVDF (due to smaller molecules and lack of fPEG component). The preparation
conditions were examined and the obtained membranes were characterized
and tested for their antifouling performance in a series of filtration
experiments. Conceptually, surface-graft modification of membranes
by blending active component first in the membrane structure for the
attachment of other functional monomers or groups has seldom been
reported.

2 Results and
Discussion
2.1 Chemical
Structure Analysis of the Membrane Surfaces
In this study,
an expected polymer structure that has a PVDF backbone plus side chains
containing hydrophilic internal segment (PMAA) and oleophobic terminal
segment (fPEG) was introduced for the modified membrane surface. As
shown in Scheme 1,
blended membranes (M1–M8, Table 1) were prepared from the mixture of PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) in various ratios, and the grafted membranes (G)
were obtained with a triblock copolymer of P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG22,23 via the three-step reaction process.

Eight modified membranes
(G1–G8) were obtained from the original eight blend membranes
(M1–M8). From the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis,
the successful grafting reactions of modification can be confirmed.
Taking M1 and M5 as the examples, Figure 1 shows the surface FT-IR spectra of each
membrane (M1 in Figure 1a and M5 in Figure 1b) before and after each transformation.

Figure 1 Surface FT-IR spectra
of the membranes M1–G1 in (a) and M5–G5 in (b).

Compared with the
spectra of the base membrane M1, a new absorption peak at 1717.00
cm–1 was detected in the spectra of G(1)1. This peak is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching
vibrations in the ester group of the grafted poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) (PtBMA). The result confirmed the successful
grafting of PtBMA on the membrane surface with P(VDF-co-CTFE). On the surface of G(2)1 membrane, the carbonyl
group peak shifted to 1709.15 cm–1, indicating the
occurrence of the hydrolysis reaction, and the ester was transformed
to carboxylic acid, i.e., P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA. The subsequent esterification reaction brought a
newly formed carbonyl absorption peak at 1727.67 cm–1, indicating that the carbonyl group in carboxylic acid PMAA was
transformed to ester. Therefore, the final step of the reaction took
place and generated P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG. Similar FT-IR spectrum changes can
be found for M5 (addition of 5 wt % PVP in the casting solution) to
G5 (Figure 1b), which
confirmed that the triblock copolymer P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG had been successfully introduced
onto the modified membrane surfaces.

Elemental analyses of the
membrane surfaces before and after the modification were detected
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), on both the unmodified
membrane M5 and modified membrane G5. Figure 2 shows the XPS spectra of M5 and G5. It can
be found that the contents of elements O and C in G5 (Figure 2a) were higher than that in
M5 (Figure 2b). The
elemental mole percentage data are summarized in Table 2. The percentage of element
O in G5 (2.83%) was higher than that of M5 (1.13%). This can be caused
by the introduction of MAA and fPEG onto the membrane, where MAA has
abundance of C=O and C–O bonds, and fPEG provides the
C–O–C bond. Same explanation can be applied for the
increasing percentage of element C from M5 (23.35%) to G5 (29.05%).

before and after modification: full XPS analysis of M5 (a) and G5
(b) and C 1s analysis of M5 (c) and G5 (d).

Table 2 Element Mole Percentages for M5 and G5 Analyzed
via XPS
 	C 1s (%)	O 1s (%)	F 1s (%)	Cl 2p (%)	
M5	23.35	1.13	73.26	0.26	
G5	29.05	2.83	67.95	0.17	
In the C 1s analysis, a C=O bond (287.75 eV) was detected
for the unmodified membrane M5, as shown in Figure 2c. This can be attributed to PVP, which was
added into the membrane. After surface-grafting modification, some
new carbon bonds were observed for the modified membrane G5 (Figure 2d). The results confirmed
again that the triblock copolymer P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG was successfully formed on
the PVDF surface. For example, the C–F3 bond (292.09
eV) comes from fPEG and the O–C=O bond (288.42 eV) is
produced by MAA. It is noticed that the peak at 287.95 eV in Figure 2d was similar to
that of the C=O bond (287.75 eV) in M5, but with a slight shift,
and the peak area was much larger than that in M5. This can be attributed
to the reacted fPEG that has repeat C–O–C group units,
which might cover the original C=O peak of PVP.

2.2 Morphology of Membranes
The surface morphologies of the original base membranes (M1–M8)
and the modified membranes (G1–G8, see Table 3) from the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
analysis are shown in Figure 3. Compared with the membranes M1–M4 (and G1–G4),
the addition of PVP in the casting mixture made the membrane structure
of M5–M8 (and G5–G8) thicker, with the formation of
more finger-like macrovoids. The addition of PVP did seem to significantly
increase the porosity of the base membrane.30

membranes M1–M8 and modified membranes G1–G8.

No obvious difference between the unmodified and modified
membranes was observed in the cross-sectional SEMs. This is because
the surface modification in this study will seldom affect the inside
membrane structure. Compared with M1–M8, the surface pores
of the modified membranes (G1–G8) were changed (became smaller).
The growth of the triblock functional copolymer on the membrane may
somehow cover or block the surface pores that are originally on the
base membranes.

The higher content of P(VDF-co-CTFE) blended in the original base membranes also led to the higher
porosity of the modified membranes, see Table 3. This may be attributed to the lower compatibility
between P(VDF-co-CTFE) and PVDF as compared to that
among PVDF itself.31,32 During the process of membrane
surface modifications, the membrane pores may be easily blocked or
reduced.33 Although no obvious pores can
be found for G1–G4, with the addition of PVP, the membrane
thickness and pore of G5–G8 were increased to almost twice
that of the membrane without PVP. For example, the thickness of the
grafted membrane G4 was 65 ± 0.5 μm and that of the membrane
G8 with PVP was increased to 155 ± 2.5 μm. The porosity
of the membranes containing 5 wt % PVP (G5–G8) increased 78.4,
80.9, 22.8, and 33.5% more than those corresponding membranes without
PVP (i.e., G1–G4).

Whereas no pure water flux was detected
for membranes G1–G4 under the filtration conditions (transmembrane
pressure, TMP of 0.15 MPa), the pure water flux of the membranes G5–G8
varied from 364.0 to 224.6 L m–2 h–1 with the increasing ratio of P(VDF-co-CTFE) in
the base membranes. This may be due to more blocking of the membrane
surface pores by more grafted products formed on the membrane. The
higher the ratio of P(VDF-co-CTFE) in the blend mixture,
the larger the amount of triblock copolymer obtained from the three-step
reaction should be grafted onto the membrane surface; therefore, more
polymer chains may extend and cover some of the membrane pores. The
surface pore sizes decreased from 0.150 μm (for G5, 9:1) to
0.107 μm (for G8, 6:4).

The surface roughness of the base
membranes (M4, M8) and the corresponding modified membranes (G4, G8)
were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Figure 4. The only difference
between membranes M4 and M8 was the addition of PVP that acted as
a porogen in the membrane formation. It can be found in Figure 4 that no obvious difference
in the roughness average (Ra) was observed
for the two base membranes (M4: 32.2 nm, M8: 32.9 nm). In contrast,
the roughness of the corresponding modified membranes were significantly
different (G4: 45.6 nm, G8: 105.0 nm). This is because the modification
reactions took place on the membrane surface, and more new components
were grafted and introduced to the membrane surface, leading to the
increase in the surface roughness.

Figure 4 AFM images
of membranes
M4, G4 and M8, G8.

A huge increase in roughness
was observed for the modified membrane G8 from M8. The addition of
PVP in the membrane M8 made it a most porous membrane structure and
also more reaction sites were available on the membrane surface. So,
larger amount of triblock copolymer could be grafted onto the membrane
surface. The speculation may be supported by the IR comparison for
G4 and G8, as shown in Figure 5. The membrane G8 had a stronger absorbance than G4 at 1729.75
cm–1 (C=O bond), which only comes from the
formation of the triblock copolymer. In addition, G8 also had a stronger
C–F bond absorbance than G4. For example, the absorbance of
the C–F bond at 1171.08 cm–1 in membrane
G8 is obviously higher than that of G4. This indicates that more C–F
bonds (from the triblock copolymer) were introduced onto the G8 surface.

Figure 5 Surface FT-IR spectra of G4 and G8.

2.3 Mechanical Strength
of the Membranes
The mechanical strength of both unmodified
and modified PVDF blend membranes was tested, as shown in Figure 6. The mechanical
properties (including tensile stress and tensile strain) of the modified
membranes G1–G8 were weaker than that of unmodified membranes
M1–M8, especially for the tensile stress (Figure 6a). It indicated that the surface-grafting
modification did not affect their mechanical properties too much.

Figure 6 Mechanical strength of
the membranes before and after
modification: (a) tensile stress and (b) tensile strain.

The membrane’s mechanical strength was found to be reduced
with the increasing ratio of P(VDF-co-CTFE) in the
original blend membrane. This may be caused by the poor compatibility
between P(VDF-co-CTFE) and PVDF. However, the membranes
with addition of PVP appeared to have more significant effect on the
mechanical strength, attributed to the more porous membranes formed,
as discussed earlier.34,35 The results were in accordance
to the observations of the SEM graphs in Figure 3, which shows that membranes M5–M8
(G5–G8) had more finger-like pores than membranes without PVP,
leading to reduced mechanical properties.

Although the tensile
stress and tensile strain of modified membranes G5–G8 were
smaller than those of membranes without PVP (G1–G4), the lowest
tensile stress and tensile strain of membrane G8 was 1.54 ± 0.11
MPa and 16.82(±0.9)%, respectively, which is still considered
to be reasonably good for ultrafiltration, whose operation pressure
is generally less than 0.3 MPa.

2.4 Surface Wettability
The surface wetting properties
of the membranes before and after modifications are summarized in Figure 7. Overall, the hydrophilicity
and oleophobicity of the modified membranes were improved as compared
to those of the original base membranes. This is because of the introduction
of the triblock copolymer on the membrane surface, and the copolymer
has both hydrophilic (PMAA) and oleophobic (fPEG) segments. Higher
ratio of P(VDF-co-CTFE) in the original base membranes
led to larger amount of the copolymer to be grafted; therefore, greater
improvement in the hydrophilic and oleophobic property could be observed.
The addition of PVP in the original blend mixture helped improve the
membrane hydrophilicity. It caused the surface modification reaction
to occur as much as possible; thus, more triblock copolymer was grafted
onto the membranes as compared to the membranes without PVP.

Figure 7 Static water contact
angles (WCAs) (a) and underwater oil contact angles (OCAs) (b) of
the membranes before and after modification.

The reported WCA of pure PVDF membrane was ∼96° and the
OCA was ∼15° (in air).22 In
this work, the first blended PVDF with P(VDF-co-CTFE)
in the ratio of 6:4 (M8) gave WCA of 81.6 ± 1.35° and underwater
OCA of 114.0 ± 2.26°. Then, after surface-grafting modification,
the modified membrane G8 showed the lowest WCA (63.7 ± 0.6°)
and the highest underwater OCA (129.7 ± 1.81°). It means
that the PVDF surface hydrophilicity and oleophobicity were greatly
improved by using such blending–surface-grafting modification.

Furthermore, the dynamic water contact angles of modified membranes
(G1–G8) were also tested. As shown in Figure 8a, the WCAs of all the grafted membranes
dropped along with the contact time. With the addition of PVP, the
WCAs of membranes G5–G8 dropped more rapidly and quickly, becoming
zero in less than 22 min. Especially, membrane G8, which was modified
from the original blended mixture of PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) in 6:4 and 5 wt % of PVP, showed the best water affinity.
The WCA decreased from 63.7 to 0° within only 9 min. Because
of the highest content of P(VDF-co-CTFE) added in
the blend mixture of PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) at 6:4 offered
the most amount of starting material for the surface-grafting modification,
more triblock copolymer that is both hydrophilic and oleophobic could
therefore be introduced to the membrane surface.

Figure 8 Dynamic WCAs of modified
membranes G1–G8
(a) and the comparison between M8 and G8 (b).

Figure 8b shows a comparison between
the unmodified base membrane M8 and the modified membrane G8. The
starting WCA of G8 (63.7°) was lower than that of M8 (81.6°),
and the WCA of G8 dropped much faster than that of M8. This can further
indicate that the surface-grafted triblock copolymer greatly improved
the membrane surface water wettability.

2.5 Membrane Antifouling Performance
The antifouling performances of the four modified membranes G5–G8
were evaluated by the filtrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution36 and oil/water emulsion37 under the same filtration conditions. Besides, one of the unmodified
membranes, M8, which has the highest content of P(VDF-co-CTFE) (PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) = 6:4) and PVP, was
also chosen to test for the filtration experiments. Figure 9 shows the relative flux decays
(RFDs) of the prepared membranes during the filtration of BSA solution
and oil/water emulsion. Other related data are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

and M8 versus filtration time: (a) 1.0 g L–1 BSA

G8	219.3	91.4	203.4	58.3	92.7	98.6	97.3	
As shown in Figure 9a and Table 4, the initial pure water fluxes (Jo) of M8, G5–G8 membranes were at 337.7, 377.3, 268.2, 241.7,
and 221.1 L m–2 h–1, respectively.
The flux difference between the original unmodified membrane M8 and
the modified membrane G8 can be explained by the surface pores blocking
caused by surface grafting (the reason for the water flux decline
from G5 to G8 has been discussed in previous
Section 3.2).

Although the unmodified membrane M8 showed a very
high water flux at the beginning, the permeation flux dropped most
quickly during the 120 min filtration of the BSA solution. The performance
showed that the relative flux decay (RFD) reached 83.1%, the relative
flux recovery (RFR) was only 43.0%, and the BSA retention rate was
very low (28.8%). After the surface modification, the modified membrane
G8 showed the smallest flux decay (62.7% RFD), the highest RFR (89.3%),
and a much improved BSA retention rate (at 69.4%). Among the various
modified membranes, from G5 to G8, the membranes with more grafted
triblock copolymer exhibited a much slower flux decay, a higher RFR,
and a greater BSA retention. It indicated that the introduction of
the functional triblock copolymer on the membrane surface can indeed
enhance the antifouling effects to the proteins.

During the
filtration of oil/water emulsions, a similar phenomenon was observed
in Figure 9b. The separation
efficiency of the oil/water emulsion followed the trend: G8 > G7
> G6 > G5 > M8. That is to say, the more grafted functional
copolymer on the PVDF membrane surface, the better the filtration
results obtained for the membranes. As shown in Table 5, the original unmodified membrane M8 gave
the smallest oil retention (30.4%), the highest RFD (78.8%), and the
lowest RFR (51.8%). However, after the modification of M8 to G8, the
oil/water separation property was dramatically improved. The G8 membrane
gave the greatest oil retention (98.6%), the lowest RFD (58.3%), and
the highest RFR (92.7%). The other modified membranes G5, G6, and
G7 also had a good oil retention of 86.8, 97.8, and even 98.9%, respectively.
All these results support the antifouling improvements of the modified
membranes, which was grafted with the functional copolymers that had
both hydrophilic and oleophobic segments within their molecular structure.

A second cycle of the oil/water filtration was also carried out
for each type of membrane after a 10 min ultrasonic cleaning of the
used membrane in previous run. Their oil retention rates were found
to be slightly decreased, but still maintained at a good level, for
example, G7 at 98.0% and G8 at 97.3%, as shown in Table 5.

The modified membranes
in this paper showed a good antifouling performance, especially in
the oil/water emulsion separations. Figure 10 shows the oil retention and the permeation
fluxes of the membrane G8 in five repeated filtration cycles. Although
the permeation flux after 2 h filtration (Jw) declined in each cycle, the stable pure water flux (Jc) was maintained at a similar level after a simple water
clean up, and, the oil retention was still maintained at as high as
96.2% after the five times of reuse. The visual effect of the oil/water
emulsion separation by the membrane G8 is showed in Figure 11.

2.6 Blending and Surface-Grafting Method versus
Additive-Blending Method
The modification of PVDF membrane
in this study is achieved by the blending and then surface-grafting
method, which is different from the method reported by Zhu et al.,22 who prepared the triblock copolymer as additive
first and then blended it with PVDF to obtain the blend membrane.
A brief comparison between them are summarized in Table 6. The results indicated that
both membranes modified in different ways showed quite similar antiorganic
fouling properties. The BSA rejection of the surface-grafted membranes
(69.4%) was a little smaller than that of the blend membrane (71%),
but their anti-oil fouling ability was essentially the same; the oil
rejection of the surface-grafted membrane in this work (∼99%)
was as high as that of the blend membrane (99%). It means that the
triblock copolymer prepared from P(VDF-co-CTFE) is
an excellent membrane modifier, no matter it acts as a blend additive
or a surface modifier candidate.

and Oil of Different Membranes

As compared with the additive-blending
method, the modified PVDF membrane surfaces with greater flexibility
and similar antifouling property were achieved by using the present
blending and then surface-grafting method. This blending and then
surface-grafting modification also avoid the possible problem in polymer
solubility when additive polymer having large and complex molecular
structure was prepared and blended with the base membrane materials.

3 Conclusions
A functional triblock copolymer of P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG has been found to be effective
in modifying PVDF membrane for hydrophilic and oleophobic surface
property. Instead of obtaining P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG first and then blending it
with PVDF base material for membrane preparation, the present work
blended P(VDF-co-CTFE) with PVDF first and then surface-grafted
PMAA and fPEG with P(VDF-co-CTFE) on the blend membrane
to obtain the desired functional polymer structure of P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG.
It was found that this approach did not encounter the problem of polymer
solubility for the large and complex additive of P(VDF-co-CTFE)-g-PMAA-g-fPEG in the previous
approach and also provided the flexibility in controlling the density
of the grafted copolymer structure. The prepared PVDF membranes showed
both hydrophilic and oleophobic surface properties as well as good
antifouling performance. It was found that the addition of PVP into
the casting solution can further improve the property of the modified
PVDF membranes due to the formation of more porous membrane surface
and cross-sectional structure. In general, the higher the ratio of
P(VDF-co-CTFE) in the blending mixture, more triblock
copolymer should be grafted onto membrane surface, which may enhance
the hydrophilicity and oleophobicity of the obtained membranes. Surface
grafting can reduce the membrane’s pore size and thus lower
its water flux, but the membrane showing higher rejection to organic
pollutants such as protein and oil, achieved a lower relative flux
decay during filtration and a higher relative flux recovery after
water flushing cleaning. The modified PVDF membranes were used several
times in a series tests and showed consistent performance. Therefore,
the novel method by blending and then surface grafting presents an
excellent alternative in PVDF membrane modification by using multifunctional
and large molecular polymers.

and disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4, 99%)
were obtained from Macklin; p-toluenesulfonic acid
(TSA, 98.5%) and 4-dimethyl aminopyridine (DMAP, 99%) were purchased
from Alfa-Aesar; perfluoroalkyl poly(ethylene glycol) (fPEG, zonyl

from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company; toluene (AR) from Enox; and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, AR) from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical
Reagent. All the chemicals were used as received. Deionized (DI) water
(18 MΩ), purified with a Milli-Q system from Millipore, was
used to prepare all the solutions as needed in the study.

4.2 Preparation of Base PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) Blend Membrane
PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) blend membranes were first prepared by the immersion precipitation
method.38 A specific amount of PVP was
first dissolved in NMP and stirred for 30 min, where PVP was used
to adjust the porosity of the base membrane.39 Then, a mixture of PVDF and P(VDF-co-CTFE) in different
ratios was added into the solution and mechanically stirred at 350
rpm under 80 °C for 24 h. The obtained homogeneous casting solution
was allowed to stand for deaeration at room temperature for 12 h and
then cast onto a clean glass plate with a casting thickness of 250
μm. The plate was immediately immersed in a deionized water
bath at 60 °C for at least 2 h to completely remove the solvent
and sufficiently solidify the membrane structure. Finally, the membrane
was washed repeatedly with DI water and then dried naturally. The
compositions of the various PVDF/P(VDF-co-CTFE) membranes
prepared in this study are given in Table 1, where M1–M4 had no PVP and M5–M8
had PVP at 5 wt % in the cast solutions.

4.3 Surface-Grafting Modification on the Base
Blend Membranes
The graft modification reactions on the blend
PVDF membrane surface are shown in Scheme 1. The graft sites were triggered on the membrane
surface through an atom transfer radical polymerization reaction from
the blended P(VDF-co-CTFE) in the base membrane under
a nitrogen atmosphere. For a typical modification process, the base
blend membrane (M1) with a diameter of 50 mm was weighed (0.54 g)
and then placed into 75 mL methanol in a 250 mL round-bottom flask.
PMDETA (12.8 mg), t-BMA (55 mg), and catalytic CuCl
(6.9 mg) were added into the solution and the mixture was magnetically
stirred at 200 rpm under 60 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the
membrane was taken out and washed several times in methanol followed
by deionized water and then vacuum dried for 24 h before the next
reaction. The membranes were designated as G(1). In this
reaction, poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) (PtBMA) groups
were introduced onto P(VDF-co-CTFE) in the base blend
membranes M1–M8. The second step was a hydrolysis reaction
for the PtBMA groups on P(VDF-co-CTFE) to be hydrolyzed
to its carboxylic acid form, i.e., poly(methyl acrylic acid) (PMAA).
The G(1) membrane (0.59 g) was placed into a flask with
0.12 g TSA and 75 mL toluene. The reaction was conducted at 80 °C
for 8 h. The membrane was then taken out from the flask and washed
with deionized water and finally dried in vacuum. The obtained membrane
was denoted as G(2). In the third step, an esterification
reaction was carried out on the membrane G(2). In a flask
with membrane G(2) (0.61 g) in 75 mL methanol, DCC (11
mg), DMAP (1.1 mg), and fPEG (30 mg) were added. The mixture was magnetically
stirred at 200 rpm at room temperature to allow the reaction to take
place for 7–10 days. Finally, the membrane was washed thoroughly
with deionized water and then dried in vacuum to a constant weight.
The obtained membrane was the modified product in this study and used
for further evaluation and filtration experiments. Therefore, correspondingly
M1–M8 membranes, final membrane products G1–G8 were
obtained.

4.4 Membrane
Chemical Composition
An attenuated total reflection-FTIR
spectrometer (ThermoFisher 6700) was used to investigate the functional
groups on the membrane surface. The membrane samples were analyzed
with a single high-sensitivity diamond reflection measurement crystal
with a spectral range of 500–4000 cm–1 and
a resolution of 0.09 cm–1. The surface compositions
of the membranes were also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (ESCALAB 250xi, U.K.) using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the radiation
source. Survey spectra were obtained over a range of 0–1201
eV.

4.5 Membrane Morphology
The morphologies of the prepared membranes were observed with a
scanning electron microscope (SEM, Phenom Pro). The surfaces and cross
sections of the prepared membrane samples were scanned for the SEM
images with an excitation voltage of 5 kV. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM, Multimode 8, Bruker) was performed using a Nanoscope V controller
(Bruker) scanning probe microscope to measure the surface morphology
and roughness of the membrane samples. The AFM scanning area of each
membrane in this study was 20 μm × 20 μm. The porosity
of the membranes was estimated from the following equation:40 ε = (m1 – m2)/(ρ × A ×
δ) × 100%, where m1 and m2 are the wet weight and dry weight (kg) of
the membrane sample, respectively, ρ is the density of water
(kg m–3), A is the actual area
of the membrane sample (m2), and δ is the thickness
(m) of the membrane sample.

The average surface pore sizes (r) of the prepared membrane samples were roughly estimated
by the medium immersion method from the following formula41  where ε
is the porosity (%), η is the viscosity of deionized water (8.9
× 10–4 pa s), Q is the volume
of water through membrane per unit time (m3 s–1), and A is the actual area of membrane (m2), δ is the membrane thickness (m), and ΔP is the transmembrane pressure (0.1 MPa). The thicknesses of the
membrane samples were determined from their corresponding SEM images,
and then their cross-sectional areas were calculated.

4.6 Membrane Mechanical Strength
Tensile strengths and tensile strains at the breaks of the membrane
samples were measured using an electronic tensile testing machine
(Instron 5944) operated at room temperature with a strain rate of
1 cm min–1. For each condition used, the average
value of at least three tests was reported.

4.7 Membrane Surface Wetting Properties
The surface wettability of the prepared membranes were examined with
the water contact angles (WCAs) and oil contact angles (OCAs) measurements
using a contact angle goniometer (ramé-hart 500). The WCAs
were obtained through the static sessile drop method and OCAs of the
prepared membranes were obtained by the underwater static captive
bubble method.42 For each membrane sample,
several measurements at different locations were made (at least five
data for each sample were collected) and the average value of the
measurements with an error less than 3° was used as the representative
water or oil contact angle of the tested membranes.

4.8 Permeation and Antifouling Properties
of the Membranes
The antifouling and permeation properties
of the base PVDF blend membranes (M1–M8) and modified PVDF
membranes (G1–G8) were tested using a dead-end filtration system
with an effective filtration area of 10.18 cm2. Deionized
water was first passed through the membrane under a transmembrane
pressure (TMP) of 0.15 MPa until a stable permeation flux was achieved
over 30 min. Upon stabilization, the pressure was maintained at 0.10
MPa and the permeate flux was collected at 10 min intervals for 120
min. The collected flux was weighed to determine the average transmembrane
flux of pure water (Jo) within 120 min.

Fouling tests were performed using the same equipment but a slightly
different setup for flux measurement. A 1.0 g L–1 BSA solution was prepared by dissolving BSA in an isotonic phosphate-buffered
saline solution (formulated with sodium dihydrogen phosphate and disodium
hydrogen phosphate, pH = 7.0) and pressurized at 0.10 MPa to filter
through the membrane following the same procedure as above for the
DI water; the flux after 120 min was recorded as Jw. After the filtration of BSA solution was completed,
the membrane was taken out and washed (ultrasonic vibration cleaning
for 10 min at the vibration frequency of 40 kHz). The membrane was
put back into the system and the stable pure water flux was measured
again and recorded as Jc.

The BSA
retention (or rejection) rate was calculated by the equation RBSA = (1 – CBSA-p/CBSA-f) × 100%, where CBSA-p and CBSA-f represent
the BSA concentrations in the permeate and feed, respectively, which
were measured by a UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV3600, Japan)
at the wavelengths of 280 nm. The same procedure was followed during
the filtration experiments for the oil/water emulsion (0.4 g L–1 of n-hexadecane in deionized water).
The oil rejection rate was evaluated by total organic carbon analysis
(Shimadzu TOC-L CPH, Japan) of the feed and permeate samples. The
filtration experiments for the oil/water emulsion were then repeated
with the same membrane for up to five times. The relative flux decay
(RFD) was calculated by RFD = [(Jo – Jw)/Jo] × 100%,
and the relative flux recovery (RFR), indicating the extent of the
possible reversible fouling, was calculated by RFR = (Jc/Jo) × 100%.
