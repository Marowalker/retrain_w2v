Among biologically active compounds,
calcium ions (Ca2+) are one of the most important species
in cell physiological functions.
Development of new calcium chelators with two-photon absorption (TPA)
properties is a state-of-the-art challenge for chemists. In this study,
we report the first and efficient synthesis of 5-bromo-2-nitrobenzyl-substituted
ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) as a platform for a new generation
of calcium chelators with TPA properties in the near-infrared region.
New calcium chelators with high TPA properties, that is, a two-photon
(TP) fragmentation efficiency of δu = 20.7 GM at
740 nm for 2-(4-nitrophenyl)benzofuran (NPBF)-substituted EGTA (NPBF-EGTA, Kd = 272 nM) and δu = 7.8 GM
at 800 nm for 4-amino-4′-nitro-1,1′-biphenyl (BP)-substituted
EGTA (BP-EGTA, Kd = 440 nM) derivatives,
were synthesized using Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions of
the bromide with benzofuran-2-boronic acid and 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl
boronic acid, respectively. The corresponding acetoxymethyl (AM) esters
were prepared and successfully applied to the Ca2+-uncaging
reaction triggered by TP photolysis in vivo.

Introduction
Calcium ions (Ca2+) play pivotal roles in various biological
phenomena,1−3 including sending and receiving nerve motions, muscle
contractions, delivery of hormones and other chemicals such as neurotransmitters,
maintaining a normal heartbeat, and blood clotting. Artificial control
of Ca2+ levels, [Ca2+], in cells would be key
to elucidating the role of Ca2+ in biological phenomena.
Ca2+ levels may be controlled by the “encapsulation
(=caging) and release (=uncaging)” of Ca2+. Biologically
active cations (Ca2+) can be caged by organic chelators4−9 and uncaged by photo-triggered structural changes in the chelator.

Since 1980, the structures of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid
(EGTA)5 and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)10,11 have been known as excellent chelators that bind selectively to
Ca2+ (Figure 1). Indeed, Ellis-Davies and co-workers used an EGTA chelator for
the photochemical uncaging of biologically active Ca2+.4−9 In 2012, BAPTA was used by Campo and co-workers for pH-independent
caging of Ca2+ as well as its uncaging by photolysis.11

from platform 1a.

For state-of-the-art physiological experiments in living
cells
and organisms, two-photon (TP) uncaging process using near-infrared
(IR) light is becoming essential.4−9,12−25 Alternatively, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles have
also proved to be efficient in recent years.26−32 Meanwhile, the three-dimensional (3D) resolution achieved using
TP excitation is higher than that of one-photon (OP) excitation reactions.
Furthermore, the near-IR TP excitation process allows deeper penetration
of the light beam in living tissue and reduced light scattering.4−9,12−25 The optical absorption by endogenous chromophores is also reduced,
so less photo-damage to cells is expected. To date, nitrodibenzofuran
(NDBF)-substituted EGTA (NDBF-EGTA)5 is
the only Ca2+ chelator reported to have TP uncaging reactivity
when excited at 720 nm (Figure 1). The TP uncaging cross section (δu), δu = σ2 × φ, was reported to be
∼0.6 Göppert-Mayer (GM)33 (1 GM = 10–50 cm4 s/photon/molecule).
The value of σ2 is the two-photon absorption (TPA)
cross section in GM, and φ is the quantum yield of the uncaging
reaction. High cross-section GM values in the TP uncaging reaction,
for example, 3 GM,34 have been suggested
as a requirement for physiological studies.

In the present study,
we report the first and efficient synthesis
of 5-bromo-2-nitrobenzyl-substituted EGTA derivative 1a (R = Et), which is a versatile platform for a new generation of
caged calcium compounds (Figure 1). Bromide 1a can be utilized for the
synthesis of a wide variety of TP-responsive Ca2+ chelators,
using Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions.35 Thus, the TP absorption maximum and TP reactivity can be
tuned by selecting a different aryl group (Ar) in boronic acids ArB(OH)2. Compounds 2 and 3 (Scheme 1) were prepared as examples
in this study. Efficiencies of TP-induced bond cleavage reactions
were found to be as high as δu = 20.7 GM at 740 nm
for 2a and δu = 7.8 GM at 800 nm for 3a. The corresponding acetoxymethyl (AM) esters 2b and 3b were synthesized and were shown to be effective
for in vivo Ca2+ uncaging reaction.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Compounds 1a, 2, and 3
The synthesis of 1a is summarized
in Scheme 1. Commercially
available starting material 3-bromo-acetophenone (4)
was nitrated36 with nitric acid and sulfuric
acid to afford nitro-substituted compound 5 in 64% yield.
Bromination of 5 with Br2 in the presence
of acetic acid in dichloromethane at room temperature (RT) provided
the brominated compound in 99% yield. Without further purification,
the keto function of the brominated compound obtained was reduced
using sodium borohydride, followed by in situ cyclization under alkaline
treatment for 30 min at 0 °C, giving oxirane 6 in
71% yield. Epoxide 6 was subsequently treated with sodium
azide37 in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 40
°C to afford hydroxyl azide 7 in 40% yield. This
step was the key in our construction of the EGTA unit. The reaction
yield was largely dependent on the equivalents of sodium azide and
the reaction temperature. After several attempts, 1 equiv NaN3 and ∼40 °C were found to be the best reaction
conditions. Hydroxyl azide was alkylated38 with bis(2-bromomethyl)ether in the presence of cesium carbonate
in DMF at 50 °C to give compound 8 in 53% yield.
The isolated alkylated compound 8 was treated with sodium
azide at RT to give the diazide39 in 80%
yield. The diazide was then converted to diamine 9 in
80% yield by treatment with PPh3,40 followed by hydrolysis. Diamine 9 was alkylated41 with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of sodium
iodide in CH3CN to give tetraacetic acid derivative 1a in 70% yield.

Bromide 1a is a versatile
intermediate in Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions for producing
a new generation of Ca2+ chelators with TPA properties.
Numerous TPA chromophores can be prepared from the 1a platform. For example, in this study, bromide 1a was
treated with benzofuran-2-boronic acid or 4-(dimethylamino)phenylboronic
acid in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and K2CO3 to afford EGTA derivatives 2a or 3a with benzofuran or biphenyl units as TP chromophores in
95% and 90% yield, respectively. Ethyl esters 2a and 3a were hydrolyzed with potassium hydroxide (KOH), followed
by esterification with acetoxy methyl (AM) ester to give 2b and 3b in 60% yield. AM ester 2b was loaded
into cells to generate intracellular EGTA calcium chelators, vide
infra.

OP Photolysis of 2a and 3a
The photoreactions of compounds 2a(42) and 3a were investigated first using an OP
excitation process (Figure 2). The OP photochemical reaction of 2a (10 mM
in C6D6, λmax = 362 nm with
ε 18 771 M−1 cm−1) was conducted at 360 ± 10 nm using a monochromator with a
xenon lamp (500 W). The photo-induced bond cleavage reaction was monitored
using 1H NMR (400 MHz) spectroscopic analysis (Figure 2a–c). As shown
in our preliminary results on the photolysis of 2a,42 clear decomposition of 2a was confirmed
after irradiation for 8 h. Using 1H NMR analysis, fragmentation
product 11 was observed in the photolysate. Compound 11 was prepared in this study to confirm its formation during
the photolysis. The quantum yield (φ) of the photochemical decomposition
of EGTA ethyl ester 2a was determined to be 0.3 ±
0.05 at 360 nm irradiation using a xenon lamp. Ferric oxalate was
used as a chemical actinometer to determine the quantum yield.43

The OP bond cleavage reaction of 3a (10 mM in
C6D6, λmax = 403 nm with ε
8790 M−1 cm−1) was also conducted
at 400 ± 10 nm using a xenon lamp (Figure 2d–f). The photo-induced bond cleavage
was monitored using 1H NMR (400 MHz) analysis. The complete
structural decomposition of compound 3a was observed
after irradiation for 10 h. The quantum yield of the decomposition
of EGTA ethyl ester 3a was determined to be 0.05 at 400
nm irradiation.

TP Photolysis of 2a and 3a
Photochemical reactions using TP excitation by
near-IR light were
conducted for 2a and 3a in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). The TP photolysis of 2a was performed at 700,
710, 720, 730, 740, and 750 nm with a Ti:sapphire laser using ∼700
mW at ∼25 °C (Figure 3a,b). The TP photolysis of 3a was conducted
at 780, 790, 800, 810, and 820 nm at ∼25 °C (Figure 3c,d). Using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, TP-induced bond cleavage reactions
were monitored by the consumption of 2a or 3a. Wavelength-dependent changes in the rate constants were determined
by the TP decomposition of 2a or 3a. As
reported previously, the absolute value of the TPA cross section for
2-(4-nitrophenyl) benzofuran was 18 GM at 720 nm.42 The TP action spectra for 2a and 3a were extrapolated in comparison with the standard value. Thus, the
TP absorption characters of 2a and 3a were
determined to be ∼70 GM at 740 nm and ∼160 GM at 800
nm, respectively (Figure 3). The TP efficiencies obtained for photochemical decomposition
were 20.7 GM at 740 nm for 2a and 7.8 GM at 800 nm for 3a.

and (d) an action TP absorption spectrum of 3a.

Measurement of Ca2+ Binding Affinities
The
dissociation constants, Kd, of Ca2+ ions with 2c and 3c (R = H) were
determined by a titration method using fluo-3 fluorescent dye44,45 (Figures 5 and 6). Thus, the concentration of free Ca2+ ions, [Ca2+]F, after treating 1.0 mM solutions
of 2c and 3c was determined by fluorescence
intensity at 530 nm from fluo-3 (for a detailed procedure, see Experimental Section). The Scatchard analyses shown in Figures 5 and 6 provided dissociation constants of Kd = 272 nM for 2c and Kd = 440 nM for 3c.

Physiologic Studies of 2b In Vivo
Because
compound 2a had a TP efficiency larger than that of 3a, we loaded cultured neurons with AM ester 2b (100 μM, 35 °C for 40 min) to stimulate presynaptic terminals
with TP uncaging. We recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs)
from whole-cell-clamped neurons by irradiating with a 720 nm-wavelength
femtosecond laser (140 fs, 7.6 mW, 1 ms) at 100 points, encompassing
a small dendritic region (Figure 4a). The mapping experiments were repeated 81 times
in four cells. We recorded IPSCs selectively at dendrite edges, where
synapses are most frequently formed. Laser irradiation seldom induced
currents over numerous uncaging events on the dendrites (Figure 4b), supporting that
the IPSCs are not caused by damages of the plasma membrane in the
presynaptic terminals. The time course and amplitude of the uncaging-induced
IPSCs were similar to those of the spontaneous IPSCs, except that
they were elicited shortly after uncaging (Figure 4b,c). The mean latency of 2.5 ms (±0.4
ms, n = 150) was similar to those of IPSCs evoked
by electrical stimulation. Uncaging-induced IPSCs were recorded in
only up to four out of 81 sequences applied to the dendrite, indicating
that the increase in [Ca2+]i was smaller than
that induced by action potentials. Thus, we have succeeded in stimulating
presynaptic terminals directly by TP uncaging to elicit neurotransmitter
release, whereas further improvements to the TP excitation cross section
are necessary to make the most of presynaptic terminal stimulation
without the action potential.

region shown in the lower panel indicate the 100 uncaging points separated
by 0.55 μm for TP uncaging and mapping of the IPSCs. The mapping

times out of 81 sequences, as denoted by color. (b) IPSCs recorded
from the single uncaging point of the cell where four IPSCs were recorded.

Conclusions
In
this study, we designed and synthesized 5-bromo-2-nitrobenzyl-substituted
EGTA as a platform for a new generation of calcium chelators with
TPA properties. The efficient synthesis of this new bromide was accomplished
in nine steps from a commercially available starting material. New
calcium chelators with TPA properties, that is, TP fragmentation efficiencies
of δu = 20.7 GM at 740 nm for NPBF-EGTA (Kd = 272 nM) and δu = 7.8 GM
at 800 nm for BP-EGTA (Kd = 440 nM) derivatives,
were synthesized using a Suzuki–Miyaura reaction to couple
the bromide with benzofuran-2-boronic acid and 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl
boronic acid, respectively. The corresponding AM esters were synthesized
and successfully applied to a Ca2+-uncaging reaction triggered
by photolysis in vivo.

Experimental Section
All of the
reagents and solvents were reagent grade and used without
further purification. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was
performed on silica gel plates and imaged under ultraviolet light. 1H NMR and 13C NMR data were recorded with a 400
MHz NMR spectrometer. CD3OD and CDCl3 [0.03%
trimethylsilane (TMS)] were used as deuterated solvents. Chemical
shifts are described in parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS (δ
= 0.00 ppm), and the coupling constants (J) are stated
in hertz (Hz). High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) analyses were
conducted using an Orbitrap XL instrument in the positive ion mode.

Calcium Binding
Affinities
The association constant
for the two chelators 2c and 3c was calculated
using the method of Ellis-Davies et al. by the equation  Here [Ca2+]B is the
concentration of Ca2+ bound to the chelator, [Ca2+]F is the concentration of the free Ca2+, and
[chelator]T is the total concentration of the chelator
(NPBF-EGTA acid or BP-EGTA acid) in the solution. The free and bound
calcium concentrations were obtained from the emission spectra of
a calcium-sensitive dye (fluo-3, Kd =
500 nm) through titration with calcium chloride solution.

In
this measurement, chelators (1.0 mM), fluo-3 (0.01 mM), Hepes (10
mM) pH 7.4, and 100 mM KCl solutions were used. A 3.0 mL solution
of 1.0 mM chelator was used. The solution was buffered to pH 7.4 with
Hepes, and the ionic strength was set with 100 mM KCl. Data from the
titration with incremental addition of Ca2+ are shown in Figures 5 and 6.

Figure 5 (a) Emission
spectra of fluo-3 (10 μM, excitation at 490
nm) resulting from the titration of 2c (1.0 mM in Hepes/100
mM KCl, pH 7.4 at 298 K) with incremental addition of Ca2+. (b) Scatchard analysis (using Kd value
of 500 nM for fluo-3) of these data.

Figure 6 (a) Emission spectra of fluo-3 (10 μM, excitation at 490
nm) resulting from the titration of 3c (1.0 mM in Hepes/100
mM KCl, pH 7.4 at 298 K) with incremental addition of Ca2+. (b) Scatchard analysis (using Kd value
of 500 nM for fluo-3) of these data.

[Ca2+]B/[Ca2+]F were
obtained from the absorption curves shown in Figures 5 and 6. The concentration
of chelators was 1.0 mM, and the CaCl2 concentrations were
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, and 0.5 mM for NPBF-EGTA acid and 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 mM for BP-EGTA acid. After these concentrations,
any change was not observed in the absorption curve.

The free calcium concentrations were calculated from the equation  where Kd = 500
nM (fluo-3), Aint = absorbance of chelator
at setted Ca2+ concentration, Amin = absorbance of chelator without Ca2+, and Amax = absorbance of chelator with excess Ca2+.

Dissociated Cultured Neurons, Electrophysiology, and Two-Photon
Uncaging
Cerebral cortices from male C57BL/6 mouse brains
(E17.5) with 0.15% trypsin in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and DNase I (30 mg mL–1) were
used. The cells were plated on laminin- and poly-d-lysine-coated
cover glasses with a density of 1.7 × 105 cells per
square centimeter. The neurons were maintained in a serum-free medium
(Neurobasal Medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX and
2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). For electrophysiological experiments,
an extracellular solution was based on SolA containing 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM cyclothiazide, 50 mM picrotoxin, and 320 nM Na-pyruvate,
at pH 7.4. The cultured cells were first loaded with the compound 2a (100 μM) for 40 min in a solution containing CrEL
(0.03%, Invitrogen) and bovine serum albumin (5%) in SolA, followed
by washing with SolA for 20 min at 35 °C. The postsynaptic cells
(DIV 10–15) were whole-cell-clamped (holding potential = −70
mV) and perfused with intracellular solution (in mM: CsCl 140, Hepes
10, MgATP 4, Na2GTP 0.3, Na2-phosphocreatine
10, Alexa-594 0.025, pH = 7.25 with CsOH). Electrical stimulation
of 70 μA amplitude was applied, at 100–150 μm from
the dendrites.

Two-Photon Excitation Imaging and Uncaging
The cultured
neurons were placed on an inverted laser-scanning microscope (FV1000
and IX81; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a water-immersion
objective lens (UPlanApo60xW/IR; N.A. 1.2; Olympus Corporation) and
a femtosecond laser (Mai Tai; Spectra Physics Inc., Mountain View,
CA, USA). Tunable wavelengths were set at 950 and 720 nm for imaging
and uncaging, respectively.
