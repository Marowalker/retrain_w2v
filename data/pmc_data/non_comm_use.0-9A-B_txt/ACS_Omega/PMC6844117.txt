Synthesis,
characterization, reactivity, and sensing properties
of 4-formylbenzoate complexes of copper(II), zinc(II), and cadmium(II)
possessing the 1,10-phenanthroline ancillary ligand are studied. The
crystal structures of the (1,10-phenanthroline)bis(4-formylbenzoate)(aqua)copper(II)
and (1,10-phenanthroline)bis(4-formylbenzo-ate)zinc(II) and a novel
molecular complex comprising an assembly of mononuclear and dinuclear
species of (1,10-phenanthroline)bis(4-formylbenzoate)cadmium(II) are
reported. These zinc and cadmium complexes are fluorescent; they show
differentiable sensitivity to detect three positional isomers of nitroaniline.
The mechanism of sensing of nitroanilines by 1,10-phenanthroline and
the complexes are studied by fluorescence titrations, photoluminescence
decay, and dynamic light scattering. A plausible mechanism showing
that 1,10-phenanthroline ligand-based emission quenched by electron
transfer from the excited state of 1,10-phenanthroline to nitroaniline
is supported by density functional theory calculations. In an anticipation
to generate a fluorescent d10-copper(I) formylbenzoate
complex by a mild reducing agent such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride
for similar sensing of nitroaromatics as that of the d10-zinc and cadmium 4-formylbenzoate complexes, reactivity of d9-copper(II) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence
of 4-formylbenzoic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline is studied. It did
not provide the expected copper(I) complex but resulted in stoichiometry-dependent
reactions of 4-formylbenzoic acid with hydroxylamine hydrochloride
in the presence of copper(II) acetate and 1,10-phenanthroline. Depending
on the stoichiometry of reactants, an inclusion complex of bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(chloro)copper(II)
chloride with in situ-formed 4-((hydroxyimino)methyl)benzoic acid
or copper(II) 4-(hydroxycarbamoyl)benzoate complex was formed. The
self-assembly of the inclusion complex has the bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(chloro)copper(II)
cation encapsulated in hydrogen-bonded chloride-hydrate assembly with
4-((hydroxyimino)methyl)benzoic acid.

Introduction
Self-assemblies of
metal complexes are prospective candidates for
optical devices.1−5 The photoluminescence of small inorganic complexes is an emerging
topic of research in the detection of pollutant and hazardous materials.6−19 Functional modifications on coordinated ligands are used in various
inorganic syntheses.20−24 Such reactions are extended to prepare coordination polymers25 poly-nuclear complexes,26−28 rotaxanes,
and catenanes.29−31 Hydrolytic transformations of functional groups are
in use to prepare coordination polymers,32 to modify metallo–organic frameworks33 and dendrimers.34,35 The transformations of functional
groups of framework structures, polymers, and nano-dimensional materials
are of general interest to chemical sciences.36−39 The functional groups of fluorescent
compounds influence detection ability of certain analytes.40 Some functional groups of metallo–organic
frameworks are responsible for sensing volatile organic compounds.
For example, aldehyde-containing metallo–organic frameworks
are used to detect amines.41,42 The weak interactions
of photoluminescent analytes6−19 are useful to divulge emission paths. For instance, mechano-responsive
self-assemblies of luminescent frameworks are designed by enhancing
π–π, C–H···π interactions.43 Alternatively, the noncovalent interactions
of functional groups of a metal complex are utilized to construct
second-coordination sphere of metal complexes.44,45 Photoluminescence properties of a compound depend on π-stacking
arrangements; face to face, edge to face π-stacks show different
photoluminescences.46,47 Furthermore, the π-interactions
of metallo–organic frameworks are modulated to show white-light
emission.48 The π-interactions of
ligands are also useful in molecular recognition.49

The low-nuclear complexes are the primary building
constituents
of many multinuclear complexes and noncovalent assemblies. Hence,
diverse ways of weak interactions of small inorganic building blocks
affecting photoluminescence properties are imperative. We choose here
to study the sensing and the reactivity of mononuclear species shown
in Scheme 1. This represents
a mononuclear species suitable to form poly-nuclear complexes and
has option for chemical and optical sensing of different substrates.
Chemosensing by such a species would occur through several ways; out
of them, three prominent ways are (i) improvisations of electronic
effects of the metal ion, including possible redox-reaction causing
chemical transformations; (ii) transformation of the aldehyde functional
group of the 4-formylbenzoate to another functional group; (iii) utilization
of the weak interactions to form self-assemblies. The species shown
in Scheme 1 has also
the qualities to form aggregates for aggregation-induced emission,
or for intramolecular charge transfer, or exciplex to affect the fluorescence
emission from itself or on another interacting species. Each of these
is important to study the sensing ability of an analyte. The 4-formylbenzoate
on the species is electron-withdrawing to extend its electronic effect
to another fluorescent ligand of the complex through the intervening
metal ion. The electronic effects of diamagnetic metal complexes possessing
electron-rich and -deficient ligands cause signal transduction through
intramolecular charge transfer.50,51 Push–pull electronic
effects of zinc complexes of multipolar ligands cause extensive solvato-emissive
effects.4,5 Wide applications of metallo–organic
frameworks as optical materials and sensors make one curious to study
discrete units of a framework to understand properties.52,53 There are also many self-assembled aggregates comprising multiple
neutral species of zinc,54,55 manganese,56 copper carboxylates.57,58 Depending on the electronic configuration
of the central metal-ion, the inherent magnetic properties of the
metal ion directly influence the photoluminescence OFF or ON states.
A diamagnetic 4-formylbenzoate complex with 1,10-phenanthroline-based
ligand would assist in intramolecular charge transfer, whereas a paramagnetic
metal complex will be in general nonemissive. However, a nonemissive
compound may be suitable for signal transductions through chemosensing
upon concealing the metal ion or functionalization of the aldehyde
functional group or other associative and dissociative processes.
Hence, there are scopes to study chemosensing of those paramagnetic
complexes of naturally abundant copper(II) ions by reacting with a
mild reducing agent such as hydroxylamine. To understand the electronic
effects and reactivity associated with the mononuclear model complexes
of d9-copper, d10-zinc, and d10-cadmium
possessing the features discussed above, sensing properties of 1,10-phenanthroline-containing
complexes of copper(II), zinc(II), and cadmium(II) 4-formylbenzoate
complexes are presented in this article (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of Zinc and Copper Formylbenzoate
Complexes
The mononuclear complexes 1 and 2 shown in Scheme 2 are obtained from the reactions of 4-formylbenzoic acid with
zinc(II) acetate or copper(II) acetate in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline.
The copper complex 1 is a six-coordinate; it has two
monodentate carboxylates, one bidentate 1,10-phenanthroline along
with a water molecule coordinating to the copper(II) ion. The complex
adopts a distorted square-pyramidal geometry, in which one of the
4-formylbenzoate occupies the axial position and the rest of the ligands
constitute the base of the square (Figure 1a). The planar base comprises an O-atom of
water, an oxygen of formylbenzoate, two nitrogen atoms of 1,10-phenanthroline
each coordinating to a copper(II) ion. The Cu1–O2 and Cu1–O5
distances are 3.267, 3.302 Å, respectively, which indicate that
the O2 and O5 atoms are not sufficiently close to form a copper oxygen
bond. The bond distances of the two Cu–O bonds of the monodentate
carboxylates, namely, Cu1–O1, 1.945 (4) Å and Cu–O4,
2.300 (4) Å are dissimilar. The axial bond of the square pyramid
is a relatively longer Cu1–O4 bond than the other bonds because
of the Jahn–Teller effect. The Cu1–O7 distance is 1.986(4)
Å, and shows a strong binding of the water molecule to the copper
ion. The coordinated water molecule is involved in intramolecular
hydrogen bonds with the C=O bonds of the carboxylate groups.
The IR spectra of the complex have C=O stretching for the aldehyde
group at 1692 cm–1 and O–H stretching of
water molecules at 3439 cm–1. The carboxylate C=O
stretching appears at 1595 cm–1. The electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectra of the complex have a broad signal at g = 2.103 at room temperature; it shows copper is at the
+2 oxidation state in the complex. Complex 1 is formed
as the sole product in the reaction, as the recrystallized bulk material
shows an identical powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern as that
of the theoretically generated powder XRD pattern from the crystallographic
information file of complex 1.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Copper
and Zinc 4-Formylbenzoatecomplexes
The zinc complex 2 is a six-coordinate complex having
two bidentate carboxylates and biscoordinating 1,10-phenanthroline
(Figure 1b). The Zn–O
bond distances are in the range of 2.005–2.410 Å and the
two Zn–N bonds are 2.097(2) and 2.109(3) Å, respectively,
establishing their biscoordination modes to the zinc ion. The 1,10-phenanthroline-containing
zinc carboxylate complexes may form mononuclear or dinuclear complexes
depending on carboxylic acids.59 The observed
zinc–oxygen bonds of the formylbenzoate tally with the reported
carboxylates chelating zinc ions. In solution, the complex has 1H NMR signals for aldehyde C–H at 10.01 ppm. The two
sets of hydrogen atoms of the 4-formylbenzoate appear in the AA′BB′
pattern. They appear as doublet of doublet centering at 7.86 and 8.03
ppm, whereas there are signals from the three magnetically nonequivalent
sets of hydrogen atoms of 1,10-phenanthroline at 8.25, 8.86, 9.21
ppm, respectively. The bischelation of 4-formylbenzoate is reflected
in the carbonyl stretching of carboxylate observed at 1643 cm–1. The aldehyde carbonyl C=O stretching appears
at 1702 cm–1. The powder XRD of the bulk sample
of the complex tallies with the one obtained from the crystallographic
information file, which shows not only bulk purity of the sample but
also confirms the single product obtained from the reaction.

Reactivity
of 4-Formylbenzoic Acid toward Hydroxylamine in the
Presence of Copper(II) Ions
When copper(II) acetate, 1,10-phenanthroline,
and 4-formylbenzoic acid were reacted in 1:2:2 mole ratios followed
by a reaction with 2 moles of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, an inclusion
complex 3 was formed (Scheme 3). The complex has IR stretching at 3395
cm–1 because of the O–H group and at 1688
cm–1 because of the free carboxylate group. At room
temperature, the complex shows a broad ESR signal at g = 2.095; which is characteristic of a d9 electronic configuration,
suggesting it to be a copper(II) complex. The cationic part of the
complex comprises of a copper(II) ion coordinated to two bidentate
1,10-phenanthroline ligands and a chloride ligand. It has a distorted
square pyramidal geometry. The charge of the complex cation is neutralized
by a chloride ion located outside the coordination sphere (Figure 2a). The cationic
part has an umbrella-like shape, where the cover of the umbrella-like
shape comprises the copper ion coordinating to two 1,10-phenanthroline
ligands and the rod of the umbrella-like shape is the copper–chloride
bond. The symmetric nature of the cation with respect to mirror planes
is reflected in the similar Cu1–N2 and Cu1–N3 bond distances
of the two independent 1,10-phenanthroline ligands. The bond distances
are Cu1–N2, 2.009 (3) Å and Cu1–N3, 2.095(2) Å,
respectively. The Cu1–Cl1 bond distance is 2.298 (4) Å.
The anionic portion of the self-assembly of the complex is an example
of the utilization of three different aspects of supramolecular chemistry,
namely (a) halide–water interactions,60−65 (b) charge-assisted hydrogen bonds,66 and (c) anion coordination.67,68 Complex 3 forms a charge-assisted hydrogen-bonded 2D network possessing a
grid-like structure encapsulating the complex cations. Each chloride
ion in the self-assembly has a four-coordinate hydrogen-bonded environment.
It is connected to two oxime molecules (Figure 2d) through O3–H···Cl2
hydrogen-bonds [dD···A =
3.128(3) Å, ∠D···H–A, 154°].
However, the two water molecules are linked to the chloride ion through
two charge-assisted hydrogen bonds O4–H···Cl2
hydrogen bonds [dD···A =
3.228(3) Å, ∠D···H–A, 166(4)°].
The water molecules coordinating to the chloride ion also act as bridges
by forming hydrogen bonds (bond parameters listed in Table S1) with the carboxylic acid groups of two independent
molecules of oxime of the 4-formylbenzoic acid. The complex cations
having an umbrella-like shape are located at these voids of about
403 Å2 area (Figure 2c). Oximes are well-known to form molecular complexes.69,70t-Butylammonium cation encapsulations by hydrogen
bonded assemblies of halide with oxime were reported earlier by us.71 Some oximes also get encapsulated in coordination
polymers.72,73 In the present case, the self-assembly of
complex 3 has hydrated chloride ions that are hydrogen
bonded to oximes providing spaces to encapsulate pentacoordinated
copper(II) complex cations.

Scheme 3 Reaction of 4-Formylbenzoic Acid with Hydroxylamine
Mediated by Copper(II)
Acetate
Excess amounts of hydroxylamine
hydrochloride reacted with a mixture
of copper(II) acetate, 4-formylbenzoic acid ,and 1,10-phenanthroline
in a mole ratio of 1:1:1, providing a new complex 4 (Figure 2b). The complex has
4-(hydroxycarbamoyl)benzoate (Scheme 3) as one of the ligands. The complex has IR stretching
at 3403, 1721, and 1679 cm–1 because of stretching
of the O–H, carbonyl, and carboxylate groups, respectively.
At room temperature, this complex shows a broad ESR signal at g = 2.18, a characteristic feature of the copper(II) complex.
Generally, hydroxylamine is a reducing agent for copper(II) in basic
conditions but in the present reaction condition,s it did not cause
a reduction. The complex has one 1,10-phenanthroline coordinating
to a copper(II) ion, and an in situ formed 4-carboxyphenyloximate
as the chelating ligand. The anionic carboxylate end of this ligand
neutralizes the overall charge of the complex. The complex has a distorted
square pyramidal geometry, where the dCu–Cl is 2.613(1) Å. The base of the square pyramid comprises an
O2N2 environment. The Cu1–N1 and Cu1–N2 bond distances
are 1.989(3), 1.998 (3) Å, respectively, whereas the two Cu–O
bond distances, namely, Cu1–O1 is 1.935(3) Å and Cu1–O2
Å is 1.937(3) Å. These distances are comparable to each
other. Complex 4 was probably formed by attack of a water
molecule on an oxime molecule formed in situ. Such a reaction generated
the carboxy-oximate ligand that ligates to the copper(II) ion. Therefore,
we have tested this possibility by carrying out the reaction in the
presence of isotope labeled water, namely, H218O by following an identical reaction procedure used as in the synthesis
of complex 4. As the product 4 obtained
is in very small quantity, we examined the products formed in situ
by mass spectrometry. To do so, we have analyzed the mass peaks ranging
between 160 and 190 of the mass spectra of the samples from two independent
experiments; one performed with water and the other with isotopic
labeled water. There is a mass peak at 181.0758 because of the 4-(hydroxycarbamoyl)benzoic
acid in the mass spectra of each reaction mixture of these two independent
reactions. The intensity of the mass peak at 184.1159 is enhanced
drastically in the mass spectra of the sample from the reaction mixture
where isotopic labeled H218O was used (Figure S13). This shows the incorporation of 18O to 4-(hydroxycarbamoyl)benzoic acid whose m + 1 value fits to this value of mass. There are established examples
where the copper(II) ion-mediated attack of an oxy-solvent on the
C=N bond of heterocyclic compounds74 takes place, but we have difficulty in ascertaining this point in
a completely convincing manner in the present case.

4-Formylbenzoate
Complex of Cadmium(II)
We had earlier
suggested that compositions and structures of the cadmium benzoate
complexes are highly dependent on the ancillary ligands as well as
substituents.75 It was also suggested that
a poly-nuclear cadmium carboxylate complex may be a polymer in solid
state but a monomer in solution.76 These
happen as a consequence of variable coordination numbers of cadmium
ion deciding the respective self-assembly. There are examples of neutral
zinc54,55 molecular complexes where neutral complexes
comprise similar ligands; but, in the present case, two independent
compositions are held together by weak noncovalent interactions. Such
complexes generate interest to study noncovalently linked self-assemblies
of closely related dissimilar complexes. The reaction of cadmium(II)
acetate with 4-formylbenzoic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline yielded
an unusual molecular complex.

The cadmium complex 5 shown in Figure 3 is an adduct of the mononuclear cadmium complex [Cd(phen)(4forben)2] and dinuclear [Cd2(phen)2(4forben)4] (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 4forben = 4-formylbenzoate).
The powder XRD pattern of the bulk sample of the complex matches with
the diffraction pattern generated from the CIF file of the complex
by using Mercury Software (Figure S1).
Hence, it is the only product formed in the reaction. We have re-dissolved
the complex independently in different solvents and recrystallized,
but we could not get crystals for the two independent components as
a single species. The coordination number of cadmium in the dinuclear
species is eight; which is six in the mononuclear part. The 1,10-phenanthroline
ligands of both the neutral species are bidentate. The dinuclear unit
has bidentate chelating formylbenzoate ligands, which also provide
μ1-bridges to hold cadmium ions. This makes Cd2O2 type of linkage by expanding the coordination
number of cadmium to eight. Hence, the dinuclear species is a combination
of two mononuclear units.

Utility of the Zinc and Cadmium Complex in
Sensing of Nitroanilines
Many nitroaromatic compounds are
toxic;78 hence, their detections at low
concentrations by abundant nontoxic
metal ions may have utility.18 Thus, it
is necessary to differentiate the ability of detection of nitroaromatic
compounds by the nontoxic zinc complex over the cadmium complex as
cadmium ions are generally toxic. Furthermore, the zinc–salicylaldimine
complex is able to detect nitroaromatics through photoluminescence
quenching.80 It suggests that a simple
mononuclear zinc complex can serve such a purpose. In fact, there
are examples of zinc complexes that detect nitroaromatics.80−83 Having these existing facts in mind, complexes with high stability
in solution prepared through simple synthetic procedures are essential
for their utility as sensors. Furthermore, at ambient conditions,
anilines are weak ligands. Hence, a sensing methodology based on weak
interactions in the second coordination sphere would be more appropriate.82,83 However, there are many examples of metal–organic frameworks
showing excellent sensitivity toward nitroaromatics.79 The examples of small metal complexes to do so are relatively
less.15−18 The fluorescence active zinc complex 2 as well as the
cadmium complex 5 are structurally simple; they are easily
synthesized. In an earlier study, we found that self-assembly of a
molecular nickel complex was formed by weak interactions of a free
pyridine molecule to hold multiple dissimilar nickel complexes.84 These enthuses one to study assemblies of metal
complexes to explore their aggregation in solution. Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) studies of solutions of the two complexes in dimethylsulphoxide
(DMSO) show that they are aggregates in solution (Supporting Information, Figure S17). The particles of the
zinc complex and the cadmium complex in DMSO solution have an average
size of 338.8 and 380.4 nm, respectively. The respective average particle
sizes of the two complexes with 4-nitroaniline are 558.1 and 453.2
nm. Therefore, the aggregation behavior of these complexes changes
in the presence of nitroaniline and there is an increase in sizes
in both the cases. The 1H NMR of complex 5 in solution is similar to the 1H NMR of the mononuclear
zinc(II) complex 2. This suggests that the two neutral
species observed in the crystal structure of complex 5 are not distinguishable in solution. The presence of only one species
in solution for 5 from 1H NMR spectra, but
observation on the two species with independent Cd-environments in
the crystal structure, suggests the possibility of self-association.
Definite evidence for aggregation equilibrium comes from the DLS results.
The observed particle sizes from the DLS study for both the complexes
are larger than the expected molecular weight for a mononuclear complex,
showing that aggregation of the complexes takes place in solution.
The aggregates formed in solution equilibrate with segregated species
with smaller molecular weights. This could be a reason to obtain a
mononuclear complex in the case of zinc and self-assembled species
in the case of cadmium upon crystallization. In the latter case, the
association through expansion of coordination is easy. In an earlier
study, the crystal structure of a coordination polymer76 of cadmium benzoate confirmed it to be a polymer
but it remains as a monomer in solution. This happened because of
segregation of the polymeric backbone in solution, by loss of side-on
bridges offered by carboxylate ligands.76,77 Solvent-dependent
aggregation of zinc–benzoate complexes are also known.84,85 In the present case, our attempts to get suitable ESI mass of low-molecular-weight
complexes were not successful. The aggregation equilibrium is further
supported by the fact that when 4-nitroaniline was added, the average
particle sizes were increased.

The solution of complex 2 and complex 5 in DMSO emits at 411, 431, and
466 nm upon excitation at 385 nm but with different quantum yields.
The ligand 1,10-phenanthroline is also very weakly emitting at those
wavelengths, having a quantum yield of 0.030 in DMSO. The quantum
yields of the zinc and cadmium complex in DMSO solutions are 0.012
and 0.082, respectively. Complex 2 and complex 5 are soluble in DMSO and dimethyl formamide but not soluble
in acetonitrile, methanol, and water. Hence, emission spectra were
measured in different mixed solvents to confirm the effect of the
solvent to show any solvatoemissive effect. The quantum yields from
different emission spectra of the complexes in different mixed solvents
in DMSO are listed in Supporting Information Table S1. No shift in emission peaks occurred upon changing solvents
except the intensity differences. Both the complexes have the highest
respective photoluminescence quantum yield in DMSO. In each case,
the cadmium complex showed a relatively higher value of quantum yield
than the zinc complex. The emission peaks of the complexes are from
the S1 → S0 transition of the 1,10-phenanthroline
ligand where the vibrational contributions from v0 →
v0, v0 → v1 and v0 → v2 emissions are reflected as three independent
but closely spaced emission peaks. Complexes 2 and 5 are metal complexes with d10-electronic configuration
but have different ionic radii and electron affinities. Each has π-delocalized
1,10-phenanthroline heterocyclic fluorophore as one of the ligands.
Hence, there are possibilities of charge-transfer from the ligand
to electron-deficient nitroaromatic compounds. This effect caused
quenching of emission of the two complexes upon interactions with
nitroanilines. The excimer emissions of cadmium complexes in π-stacked
systems modulate emission through stimuli.43 In solution, the emissions of both the complexes get quenched by
adding nitroanilines. Two representative cases of fluorescence quenching
of complexes 2 and 5 by 4-nitroaniline are
shown in Figure 4a,b,
respectively. In each case, the emission of the complex at 411, 435
and 465 nm continuously decreases upon addition of different aliquots
of 4-nitroaniline. The emissions decrease in both the complexes being
similar but differing in emission intensities suggests a ligand-centered
emission where the electronic effects of the metal ions exist. Comparative
emission quenching abilities of three isomers of nitroaniline are
reflected in the corresponding Stern–Volmer plots shown in Figure 4c,d. Apparently,
no significant differences in the decreasing trend caused by the two
metal complexes in the ratios of intensity of emission at a particular
concentration (I) with respect to initial emission
intensity (I0) as a function of concentrations
are observed from as compared to individual nitroaniline. However,
the profiles of decreasing emissions of each nitroaniline differ from
each other. This makes it clear that the quenching paths of the two
metal complexes resemble. The differences in overall effect by the
two metal complexes are from the quantum yields of the parent complexes.
The cadmium complex has a relatively higher quantum yield but has
apparently lower changes in intensities. The nonlinear decay in the
value of I/I0 in each
profile as a function of increasing concentrations of respective nitroaniline
was observed. Hence, in these detection processes, static quenching
occurred, where ground states are not changed. This is also confirmed
by carrying out independent 1H NMR titrations of both the
complexes with 4-nitroaniline (Supporting Information Figures S14 and S15). In these titrations, no shift in the chemical
shift position of protons of the complexes or the 4-nitroaniline occurred.
To understand the quenching paths, the emission spectra of 1,10-phenanthroline
and 4-formylbenzoic acid (385 nm excitation) were independently recorded.
Both these compounds emit very weakly. The 1,10-phenanthroline weakly
emits at 411, 435, and 465 nm, whereas the 4-formylbenzoic acid emits
at 412 and 436 nm (Supporting Information Figure S19). The emission at 430 nm of 4-formylbenzoic acid upon
addition of an equivalent amount of zinc(II) chloride causes an increase
in intensity and resulted in emission to complex 2. Addition
of 4-nitroaniline to such a solution decreases the emission intensity.
The 1,10-phenanthroline also showed a similar trend and the observations
are apparently similar irrespective of the ligand or zinc or cadmium
complex used in sensing. Control experiments on emission of 1,10-phenanthroline
in solution upon addition of cadmium(II) chloride also provided similar
observations; but differences in these experiments are the relative
changes in the emission intensities. The results suggest a synergic
electronic effect between the ligands mediated by the d10-metal ions but this effect is not a dominant in quenching. The d10-metal ions provide a template to push electron density,
enhancing the transition probability of the weakly fluorescent ligand.
From the crystal structures, it is also clear that the aggregations
of the two complexes differ; but there is equilibration among the
low-molecular-weight species in solution; hence the emission wavelengths
are at the same place for both the complexes. Solid samples of complex 2 and complex 5 have broad emission at 465 nm
(λex = 385 nm) and the cadmium complex has a higher
intensity. The copper(II) complexes are nonfluorescent because of
fluorophore directly connected to the paramagnetic copper(II) ion.
The crystal structures of the zinc complexes have C–H···π
and C–H···O interactions in self-assembly (Figure S16). However, the cadmium complex has
extensive parallel co-facial π-stacking among the phenanthroline
rings in solid state and the two neutral complexes are held in the
lattice together by C–H···O interactions illustrated
in Supporting InformationFigure S17. The solid samples of the two complexes showed
a triexponential emission decay profile in each case. The emission
decay profile of the cadmium complex has equal distribution over those
three paths. Among them, two paths have relatively short lifetimes,
whereas 38.8% molecules follow a path of a relatively longer lifetime
of 13.36 ns. The zinc complex has two short-lifetime paths by smaller
fractions of molecules, and the major portions comprising 72.83% of
molecules follow a slightly longer path of lifetime of 4.97 ns (Supporting Information Figures S11 and S12).
The differences in the number of fractions of the longer lifetimes
are indicative of the fractions of excimer-like emissions in the two
cases because of packing differences. The cadmium complex has extensive
parallel co-facial π-stacks, whereas the zinc complex has C–H···π
interactions; these interactions provide definite arrangements to
the fluorophores, which also contribute to the decay path with a longer
lifetime.

As the ligand 1,10-phenanthroline itself shows
a similar quenching
process and similar emission as that of the complexes, a plausible
mechanism shown in Figure 5a is proposed for the observed quenching based on the electronic
levels of the ligands; a similar explanation is also applicable to
metal complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) optimization of energies
[using B3LYP functional and 6-31+G (d,p) basis set] of 1,10-phenanthroline
and 4-nitroaniline show that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) of 1,10-phenanthroline has slightly higher energy than the
LUMO of the 4-nitroaniline (ΔE4 =
0.1085 eV). Upon excitation, an electron from S0 of the
1,10-phenanthroline is excited to the S1 state. As the
difference of LUMOs of the donor 1,10-phenanthroline and the acceptor
4-nitroaniline is small, the excited electron from the LUMO of the
1,10-phenanthroline is transferred easily to the LUMO of the 4-nitroaniline.
This results in the quenching through excited-state charge transfer.
The LUMO of aldehyde has substantial differences from the energy than
the LUMO of 4-formylbenzoic acid (ΔE5 = 0.9974 eV), whereas the energy difference between the respective
LUMO of 4-nitroaniline and 4-formylbenzoic acid (ΔE6) is 1.0759 eV. Nitroanilines quench fluorescence of
perylene-based receptors,86 enabling differentiation
of positional isomers in a similar manner that we have observed with
the present examples. The energy of the zinc complex is optimized
by Gaussian software using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31++G (d,p)
basis set. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–LUMO
are presented in Figure 5b, indicating that the HOMO is localized in the 1,10-phenanthroline
ring whereas the LUMO is localized over the 4-formylbenzoate unit.
The HOMO–LUMO energy gap in the zinc complex (2) is 2.812 eV (440.9 nm). This clearly indicates that an S0–S1 excitation involves charge transfer from the
donor site to the acceptor site of the complex and shows that there
exists a push–pull path mediated by the intervening d10 metal ions, which is anchoring the ligands having inherent electron-withdrawing
and -releasing properties. Thus, exciplex formation of the nitroanilines
with the metal complexes inhibited the excited electron to retrace
the original path to the ground state of those complexes.

quenching paths based on quenching of emission of
1,10-phenanthroline; (b) HOMO–LUMO of the zinc complex (2) calculated by Gaussian software using the B3LYP functional
and the 6-31 + G (d,p) basis set; (c) resonance structures of 4-nitroaniline.

Among the three positional isomers, the highest
quenching was caused
by 4-nitroaniline. It is 35-fold higher than the corresponding emission
quenching caused on the zinc complex by the metaisomer. The ortho-isomer
has 2.5-times higher quenching ability than the meta-isomer. The higher
quenching ability of 4-nitroaniline is attributed to the resonance
forms of nitroaniline and iminoquinone structures shown in Figure 5c. The non-aromatic
electron-deficient nature of the imino-quinone makes it a better acceptor
for efficient quenching.

The detection limits for the three
positional isomers of nitroaniline
determined from the fluorescence titrations are listed in Table 1. These show that
the zinc(II) complex has a superior detection limit over the cadmium
complexes for the three isomers. The 2-amino-5-nitrophenol (Figure S7) is also an excellent quencher of the
two complexes. These results complement the quenching of emission
through O···π interactions on cobalt(II)17 and nickel(II)18 1,10-phenanthroline
complexes responsible in photoluminescence quenching by nitroaromatic
compounds. The present complexes have the advantages of having simple
structures and are readily soluble in DMSO and dimethylformamide (DMF);
they are also easily synthesized from commercially available reagents.
Though the present system is based on a relatively low quantum yield,
their scopes exist to develop more improvised system based on transition-metal
complexes based on the foundations provided here.

Conclusions
The
reactivity and sensing of structurally simple complexes of
the 1,10-phenanthroline ligand containing copper, zinc, and cadmium
4-formylbenzoate complexes are depicted. The study provided the fundamental
understanding on the quenching of emission of 1,10-phenanthroline
and the two d10 metal ion complexes to
be through the transfer of excited from excited state to the nitroanilines.
The possible push–pull electronic effects of the donor and
acceptor ligands are reflected in the theoretically demonstrated zinc
complex where the LUMO is localized on the 1,10-phenanthroline ligand,
whereas LUMO is localized at the 4-formylbenzoate part. Besides all
these structural aspects, an unusual molecular complex of cadmium
is also serendipitously isolated and characterized. This complex has
two neutral cadmium complexes self-assembled through C–H···π
and C–H···O interactions. The DLS experiments
have shown that the zinc and cadmium complexes form aggregates in
solution and the particle sizes of such aggregates are increased upon
interactions with nitroaniline. Both those complexes are useful in
the efficient detection of nitroanilines. The paramagnetic copper
complexes studied in this study are unsuitable for fluorescence detection
of analytes, but they provided fundamental understandings on the reactivity
of hydroxylamine, which is a conventional volatile pollutant and mild
reducing agent. The packing pattern determined from the crystal structure
of a copper(II) formylbenzoate complex possesses complex cations encapsulated
in self-assembly of oximes with hydrated-chloride ions. The packing
of the complex does not have direct interactions between oxime and
carboxylic acid but hydrated-chloride ions provided the charge-assisted
hydrogen bonds with the oxime functional group to form an assembly.
Such an assembly assisted by water molecules has a direct implication
on understanding a way of formation of water-mediated aggregation
of anions with neutral components. Beyond those results, an exceptional
copper 4-(hydroxycarbamoyl)benzoate complex is isolated and characterized
from the copper(II)-mediated oximation reaction, which has a definite
role in further developing chemosensing properties to detect volatile
organic compounds, more precisely hydroxylamine hydrochloride.

Experimental
Section
General
Infrared spectra of the solid samples were
recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrophotometer by
making KBr pellets. Powder XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker
powder X-ray diffractometer D2 phaser instrument. 1H NMR
spectra were recorded on a BRUKER Ascend-600 MHz NMR spectrometer
using TMS as the internal standard. A PerkinElmer LAMDA-750 spectrometer
was used to record the solid-state UV–visible spectra by diffuse
reflectance. Fluorescence emissions were measured in a Horiba Jobin
Yvon FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer by taking definite amount of solutions
or definite amounts of the solid sample and exciting at the required
wavelength. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded
on a JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer at room temperature, with a microwave
power of 0.998 mW, microwave frequency of 9.14 GHz, and modulation
amplitude of 2. DLS experiments were carried out on a Malvern Zeta
sizer Nano ZS instrument equipped with a 4.0 mW He–Ne laser
operating at 633 nm.

The detection limits for the positional
isomers of nitroaniline were calculated from the formula: detection
limit = 3σ/k, where σ is the standard
deviation in blank measurements and k is the slope
from the plot between the fluorescence emission intensity against
concentration of the respective nitroaniline. For such measurements,
the fluorescence emission spectra of complex 2 and complex 5 were measured 10 times and the standard deviation of the
measurements was determined. The slope was obtained from the independent
plot of intensity of emission at 435 nm of the complex versus concentration
of the respective nitroaniline. The quantum yields in solutions were
determined from the integrated areas of emission based on quinine
sulphate as the standard.

Crystallographic Study
Single-crystal
XRD data for
complexes 2 and 5 were collected at 296
K with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) by a Bruker
Nonius SMART APEX CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator
and an Apex CCD camera, whereas data for complex 1, 3, and 4 were collected on an Oxford SuperNova
diffractometer. Data reductions and cell refinement for data obtained
from an Oxford diffractometer were performed by CrysAlisPro software
and from a Bruker Nonius diffractometer were performed using SAINT
and XPREP software. Structures were solved by a direct method and
were refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELXL-2014 software. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined
in anisotropic approximation against F2 of all reflections.
The hydrogen atoms were placed at their geometric positions by riding
and refined by isotropic approximation. From the data collected at
room temperature the disorder of the oxygen atoms of the aldehydes
in complex 1 and short contacts between two hydrogen
atoms of molecules of water of crystallization in the structure of
complex 4 could not be resolved. The crystallographic
parameters of the complexes are listed in Table 2.

Synthesis and Characterization
(1,10-Phenanthroline)bis(4-formylbenzoate)(aqua)copper(II)
(1)
To a well-stirred solution of 4-formyl benzoic
acid (300 mg, 2.0 mmol) and 1,10-phenanthroline (99 mg, 0.5 mmol)
in methanol, copper(II) acetate monohydrate (199 mg, 1 mmol) was added.
The resulting solution was stirred for about 4 h. The precipitate
formed was dissolved in water and the resulting solution was kept
undisturbed for crystallization. Dark-blue crystals appeared after
2 days. (Isolated yield: 59%). IR (KBr, cm–1): 3439
(br, w), 1692 (s), 1595 (s), 1558 (w), 1520 (s), 1498 (s), 1436 (w),
1426 (s), 1385 (s), 1261 (m), 1203 (s), 1130 (m), 1106 (m), 841 (s),
802 (s).

(1,10-Phenanthroline)bis(4-formylbenzoate)zinc(II)
(2)
The zinc complex 2 was synthesized
in an
identical procedure as that of complex 1, but in this
case dimethylacetamide was used as solvent, and zinc(II) acetate dihydrate
(219 mg, 1 mmol) was used instead of copper(II) acetate. Upon crystallization,
dirty-white crystals of complex 2 were isolated in 67%
yield. 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6): 10.01 (s, 2H), 9.21 (s, 2H), 8.87 (d, J = 6 Hz,
2H), 8.25 (s, 2H), 8.08 (m, 6H), 7.87 (d, J = 6 Hz
4H). IR (KBr, cm–1): 3439 (br, w), 3060 (m), 1702
(s), 1643 (s), 1598 (s), 1552 (s), 1519 (m), 1505 (s), 1401 (s), 1299
(s), 1202 (s), 1134 (s), 1105 (m), 1013 (s), 869 (s), 853 (s), 819
(s).

Inclusion Complex of Bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(chloro)copper(II)
Chloride with 4-((Hydroxyimino)methyl) Benzoic Acid (3)
To a well-stirred solution of 4-formylbenzoic acid (300
mg, 2 mmol), 1,10-phenanthroline (99 mg, 0.50 mmol) and hydroxylamine
hydrochloride (138 mg, 2 mmol) in methanol, copper(II) acetate monohydrate
(199 mg, 1 mmol) was added. After stirring for 4 h, the precipitate
formed was re-dissolved by adding water (20 mL) to make a homogeneous
solution. The solution on standing yielded dark-blue crystals of copper
complex 3 in 71% yield. IR (KBr, cm–1): 3395 (br, s), 1688 (s), 1651 (m), 1518(s), 1427 (s), 1343 (m),
1313 (m), 1277 (s), 1217 (m), 1177 (m), 1145 (w), 1177 (m), 1107 (m),
1016 (m), 946 (s), 876 (m), 853 (s).

Copper(II) Complex of 4-(Hydroxycarbamoyl)benzoic
Acid (4)
It was prepared in a similar procedure
as that
of complex 3; but in this case the hydroxylamine was
generated for the reaction in situ by adding sodium acetate. A solution
of 4-formylbenzoic acid (300 mg, 2 mmol) and 1,10-phenanthroline (99
mg, 0.5 mmol) in methanol, copper(II) acetate monohydrate (199 mg,
1 mmol) was reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride (690 mg, 10 mmol).
To this solution, sodium acetate (500 mg, 6 mmol) was added; the solution
turned from green to red and finally to a dark-blue color. The precipitate
formed was dissolved in water (10 mL) and kept undisturbed for crystallization.
Few dark-blue crystals of complex 4 were obtained from
a mixture of crystals. The other crystals were not of good diffracting
quality, and upon recrystallization from DMF gave crystals of bis(1,10-phenanthroline)(chloro)copper(II)
chloride. DMF (confirmed by comparing by single-crystal XRD)34 and remaining residue upon purification yielded
the oxime. The isolated yield of complex 4 is 6%. IR
(KBr, cm–1): 3403 (br, s), 1721 (s), 1679 (s), 1629
(w), 1598 (s), 1521 (s), 1493 (m), 1429 (s), 1367 (w), 1306 (m), 1279
(s), 1177 (m), 1148 (s), 1109 (s), 1029 (s), 1013 (m), 918 (s), 873
(s), 851 (s).

Molecular Complex of (1,10-Phenanthroline)bis(4-formylbenzoate)cadmium(II)
(5)
The cadmium complex 4 was prepared
by an identical procedure as that of zinc complex 2 but
cadmium(II) acetate dihydrate (266 mg, 1 mmol) was used instead of
zinc(II) acetate in methanol (20 mL). Dirty-white crystals were collected.
Isolated yield: 65%. 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6): 10.01 (s, 6H), 9.19 (s, 6H), 8.80 (d, J = 12 Hz, 6H), 8.09 (s, 6H), 8.19–8.04 (m, 18H), 7.89 (d, J = 6 Hz, 12H). IR (KBr, cm–1): 3439 (br,
m), 1700 (s), 1689 (s), 1621 (s), 1593 (s), 1552 (s), 1515 (s), 1500
(s), 1426 (m), 1403 (s), 1296 (m), 1205 (s), 1143 (s), 1101 (s), 1049
