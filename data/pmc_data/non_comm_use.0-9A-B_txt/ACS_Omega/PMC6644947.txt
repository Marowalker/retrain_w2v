Nickel-encapsulated
nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Ni–TiO2–NCNTs)
are synthesized via chemical vapor deposition
by thermal decomposition of acetylene with acetonitrile vapor at 700
°C on the Ni–TiO2 matrix. TiO2 is
used as a dispersant medium for Ni nanoparticles, which assists in
higher CNT growth at high temperatures. A reference catalyst is made
by following the similar procedure without acetonitrile vapor, which
is called a Ni–TiO2–CNT. Acid treatment of
these two catalysts dissolved Ni on the surface of CNTs–NCNTs,
producing catalysts with enhanced surface area and defects. The transmission
electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectra analysis
of acid-treated version of the catalysts confirmed the presence of
encapsulated Ni. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of these
catalysts was analyzed in 0.1 N KOH solution. Among these, the acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–NCNT exhibited highest ORR onset
potential of 0.88 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and a current
density of 3.7 mA cm–2 at 170 μg cm–2 of catalyst loading. The stability of the acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT is proved by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry
measurements which are done for 800 cycles and 100 h, respectively.
Primarily N doping of CNTs is the reason behind the improved ORR activity.

1 Introduction
Replacement
of noble metal and noble metal-based electrocatalysts
for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cells and metal–air
batteries has become a potential area for research in the past few
years.1,2 Recently, a significant volume of research
has been devoted to the development of inexpensive catalysts with
good ORR activity and stability. Among all of the catalysts reported
in the literature, transition-metal (Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) coordinated
nitrogen–carbon and metal-free heteroatom-doped (B, N, F, and
S) carbon materials show good ORR activity.3−9 Among all of the carbonaceous materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
possess good mechanical and chemical stability, high surface-to-volume
ratio, and good electrical conductivity.10,11 Nitrogen doping of CNTs induces positive charge density on the adjacent
carbon atoms. These sites show enhanced chemisorption of oxygen on
the nitrogen-doped CNT (NCNT) surface and thereby leading to enhanced
ORR activity.12−14 Stevenson et al. reported improvement in the ORR
activity on the carbon nanofiber in alkaline and neutral media because
of enhanced adsorption of oxygen and decomposition of peroxide intermediates.15 For ORR, a catalyst support plays very important
role in long-term operations (simulated by load cycling and acceleration
cycling).16 Among all of the catalyst supports
reported, TiO2 acts as a promising catalyst support material
because of its voltage stability and chemical stability.17 It prevents the agglomeration of the catalyst
particles and provides thermal and oxidative stability. Although the
semiconducting nature of TiO2 limits its conductivity,17−19 the synergistic effect between TiO2 and NCNT provides
good conductivity and good stability. In the past years, researchers
explored developing catalysts without direct metal nitrogen coordination
through encapsulated metal atoms in a carbon matrix.20 Deng et al. investigated iron particle-encapsulated CNT,
which showed effectively good ORR activity. Density functional theory
(DFT) calculation has been done in order to probe the origin of interaction
between iron and carbon on the surface of CNTs.21 Hu et al. showed that encapsulated metal particles helped
in creating active sites in the outer graphitic layers and enhanced
ORR activity.20

In this work, the
nickel-encapsulated surface-modified NCNT on
TiO2 (Ni–TiO2–NCNT) has been reported
for ORR. Here, Ni–TiO2 was used to directly grow
Ni-encapsulated nitrogen-doped high-surface-area CNTs by thermal decomposition
of acetylene in the presence of acetonitrile vapor. This material
was subjected to acid treatment to etch surface Ni to obtain Ni-encapsulated
TiO2–NCNT.

2 Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the synthesized samples along
with the standard stick patterns of Ni, anatase TiO2, and
rutile TiO2 are shown in Figure 1. From the XRD pattern of Ni–TiO2 synthesized at 400 °C, the formation of metallic nickel
and anatase TiO2 phase is inferred. Peaks at 44.37°,
51.59°, and 76.08° are due to (111), (200), and (220) planes
of nickel22 (ICDD card no. #00-001-1258),
and the rest of the peaks corresponds to anatase TiO2 (ICDD
card no. #01-084-1285).23 In the presence
of acetylene and/or acetonitrile vapor at 700 °C, TiO2 has changed from the pure anatase to rutile phase. Peaks at 27.7°,
36.3°, 41.5°, 44.5°, 54.8°, 63°, 66.1°,
69.7°, 70.22°, and 75.27° correspond to (110), (101),
(111), (210), (211), (002), (221), (301), (112), and (320) planes
of rutile TiO2 (ICDD card no. #01-088-1173), respectively.23 Peak at 26.3° corresponds to the (002)
plane of multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs), and the one at 25.98° peak
is probably for the exfoliated graphitic phase.24,25 Even after acid leaching, the presence of nickel (in acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–CNT and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT) indicates the possible encapsulation of nickel
metal particles inside the tubes, as this site is nonaccessible for
acid to etch.

From the field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra of Ni–TiO2 (Figure 2a,f),
the presence of Ni and anatase TiO2 phase is inferred.
EDX spectra of Ni–TiO2–CNT, acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT,
and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT are given in
the Supporting Information of the paper
(Figure S1). Table S1 compares only the
wt % of Ni and Ti as the other elements N, C, and O cannot be quantitatively
estimated by EDX because of their low cross-sectional area. However,
the EDX spectrum qualitatively indicates their presence.

of Ni–TiO2.

From the FESEM of the Ni–TiO2–CNT,
it
can be found that Ni acted as a catalyst for growing CNTs by following
the tip growth mechanism on the TiO2 support.26 Ni–TiO2 particles are found
decorating around the CNT surface (inset, Figure 2b). After acid treatment, the CNT surface
turns smooth because of the removal of surface Ni (Figure 2d). After nitrogen doping,
there is a change in the tube structure which is mainly due to the
defects caused by N incorporation. After acid treatment, some defect
sites in the structure have been introduced because of the removal
of some amorphous carbon and surface nickel.27 To confirm the successful nitrogen doping and to study the distribution
of the elements over the specified region, elemental mapping analysis
has been carried out for Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT, and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT
(Figure 3). Elemental
mapping of Ni–TiO2–NCNT confirms the presence
of C, N, O, Ti, and Ni well distributed over the specified region
shown in FESEM (Figure 3a). It also confirms that nitrogen is successfully incorporated into
the CNT. Similarly, elemental mapping of Ni–TiO2–CNT confirms the presence of C, O, Ti, and Ni. Before acid
treatment, heavy Ni dispersion is seen throughout the CNTs of Ni–TiO2–CNT and Ni–TiO2–NCNT (Figure 3b). After acid treatment,
dispersion of Ni got reduced significantly as surface Ni is dissolved
leaving behind only the encapsulated Ni (Figure 3c).

Elemental mapping of acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT.

While comparing the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph
of (Figure 4) the Ni–TiO2–CNT with Ni–TiO2–NCNT, the
surface of both the materials seems to be less crystalline in comparison
to MWCNT’s crystallinity. As observed by XRD, the surface could
be made of exfoliated graphite. In addition, the presence of some
of the amorphous carbon cannot be ruled out. For N-doped CNTs, acetonitrile
acted as nitrogen as well as carbon source. Nickel encapsulated inside
the CNTs can be clearly seen which corroborates well with the XRD
study of the samples. After acid treatment, CNT and NCNT surface get
smoother because of the removal of surface Ni followed by stacking
of the surface carbon structure on the CNT. Thickness of the nanotubes’
wall increases after acid treatment which probably supports the stacking
of carbon layer attached on the CNT surface as a result of surface
tension exerted by water during drying. Diameter of the nanotubes
changed from 30 to 50 nm after acid treatment as seen in the TEM images.

acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT (the inset shows
at high magnification), (c) Ni–TiO2–NCNT,
and (d) acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT (the inset
shows at high magnification).

Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done
in order
to investigate the successful N doping while using acetonitrile as
the nitrogen source (Figure 5). The survey spectrum of the Ni–TiO2–NCNT
indicates the presence of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon in the sample.
Deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s spectra (Figure 5a) show the presence of C=C (284.5
eV), C–N (286.1 eV), and C=O (288.8 eV) species.12 Deconvoluted high-resolution O 1s spectra show
the presence of O–H, C–O, and C=O at 530.3, 532.9,
and 533.7 eV, respectively.28 High-resolution
deconvoluted N 1s spectra indicate the presence of N atoms with three
different binding energies corresponding to graphitic (401.3 eV),
pyridinic (398.4 eV), and pyrollic (400.3 eV).29 Atomic wt % of different N’s present is listed in Table 1. There are several
reports in the literature which confirms the enhancement of ORR activity
in the presence of pyridinic and pyrollic N content.30,31 It is to be noted that Ti 2p and Ni 2p signals are not seen for
the Ni–TiO2–NCNT probably because of screening
of TiO2 and Ni by the carbon layers. The survey spectrum
of Ni–TiO2–NCNT and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT is given in Figure 5i. While comparing Figure 5i, it is clear that there is a prominent
presence of O in the surface. C 1s spectra clearly showed the presence
of the functional groups because of acid treatment. In contrast to
Ni–TiO2–NCNT, an acid-treated counterpart
shows clear presence of Ti and Ni. However, the Ni signal was very
noisy as it was encapsulated inside the MWCNTs. Deconvolution of N
1s spectra yielded 4 types (pyridinic, pyrollic, graphitic, and pyridinic-N-oxide)
of N, and their atomic % is reported in Table 1. Formation of pyridinic-N-oxide observed
at the cost of pyridinic N while acid treating the Ni–TiO2–NCNT. During acid treatment, pyridine is oxidized
to pyridine-N-oxide. If we start with pyridine-N-oxide, while applying
negative potential during ORR, it will turn into pyridine, which in
turn will be available for ORR again. Ti 2p spectra clearly show the
presence of TiO2, and no other Ti species such as titanium
nitrides and carbides, are present (they are expected at much lower
binding energies).

Figure 6 shows Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra recorded for all of the samples.
The peak at around 3572.7 cm–1 corresponds to O–H
and N–H stretch. For the acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT, this peak has been broadened. Peaks at 1240.8, 1960.6,
and 1761.6 cm–1 are attributed to C–O, C=O
stretching, and C–H bending, respectively. Peaks at 2029.7,
2153.3, and 2454.9 cm–1 occurred due to C=C,
C–C, and C–Br stretch, respectively. C–Br stretch
could have originated from cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
used in the synthesis of Ni–TiO2. The peak at 1631.8
cm–1 corresponds to C=N stretch.

of the synthesized samples: Ni–TiO2–CNT (black
curve), acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT (blue curve),
Ni–TiO2–NCNT (red

curve).

All of the Raman modes of TiO2 (Eg at 144,
197 and 639 cm–1, B1g at 399 cm–1, and A1g at 599 cm–1) were observed
in the Raman spectra of all of the four samples, as shown in Figure 7. Peaks at ∼1350
and ∼1580 cm–1 are corresponded to D and
G bands of carbon materials, respectively.32 The ID/IG ratio of all of the samples is calculated (Table 2) based on the area under G and D peaks.
For undoped samples, the ID/IG ratio is higher compared to the doped one probably because
acetonitrile (N source) acted both as the nitrogen and carbon source.
However, acid treatment enhanced the ID/IG ratio, as new surface defects were
incorporated by etching out of nickel and addition of functional groups
(−OH and −COOH) by oxidation of the MWCNT surface by
HNO3. For undoped samples, splitting of G band into G and
D′ bands is probably due to the interaction between extended
phonon modes of the graphitic phase with localized vibrational modes
of the impurity present.33 Splitting of
G band into D′ and G bands of the graphitic layer can be attributed
as the result of intravalley phonon interaction with interband electronic
transitions in the presence of Raman-active Eg modes. In
the case of N-doped samples, the absence of D′ band is observed,
which can be explained as the phonon energy normalization due to the
allowed electronic interband transition in the graphitic layers.34,35

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of Ni–TiO2–CNT,
acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT, and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT
recorded in air atmosphere has been shown in Figure 8. A weight loss of 60, 50, 65, and 70% has
been noted from TGA of Ni–TiO2–CNT, acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT,
and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT, respectively,
because of the decomposition of carbon at 550 °C.36 For the nitrogen-doped samples, weight loss
is more due to the release of NO2 and CO2 gases
while heating in air atmosphere. Acid-treated versions showed the
higher weight loss than the corresponding nontreated one because of
the absence of surface Ni and presence of doped nitrogen.

The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller)
surface areas of
Ni–TiO2–CNT, acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT, and acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–NCNT are found to be 67.58, 71.88,
153.6, and 206.47 m2/g, respectively (Figure 9). Because of the nitrogen
doping surface area of the CNTs increased by 2.27 times that of the
undoped CNTs and the acid treatment resulted in further increase (3.05
times) of surface area which is probably due to roughening of the
CNT surface and loss of surface Ni. Higher surface area is beneficial
as this would enhance the ORR current density.

samples: (a) acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT, (b)

Figure 10 shows
the cyclic voltammetry (CV) obtained for all of the catalysts in O2-saturated 0.1 N KOH solution. Onset potentials obtained from
the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for the ORR are 0.76 V (Ni–TiO2–CNT), 0.78 V (acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT), 0.84 V (Ni–TiO2–NCNT), and
0.88 V (acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT) versus
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Among all of the catalysts, the
acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT shows the best
performance. After acid treatment, ORR activity improved due to the
CNT surface roughening and adsorption of oxygen due to the positive
charge density variation on the CNT surface induced by N doping.13

Ni–TiO2–CNT, (c) Ni–TiO2–NCNT, and (d) acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT
in O2-saturated 0.1 N KOH solution recorded at a 20 mV/s
scan rate at 25 °C.

In order to investigate the ORR activity further, LSV was
performed
at different rotation per minutes (rpms) (200–1600) (Figure 11). With the increase
in the rotation speed, the increase in current confirms the supply
of oxygen from the solution to the electrode surface (diffusion of
O2 species). For the Ni–TiO2–CNT,
limiting the current density at 1600 rpm is found to be 2.7 mA cm–2. After acid treatment, oxygen adsorption and product
desorption get improved because of the defect induced by leaching
of Ni on the CNT surface; therefore, overpotential for ORR got reduced.
On nitrogen doping, because of charge delocalization on the CNT surface,
an increase in current density was observed with simultaneous increase
in the ORR onset potential (0.84 V vs RHE). After acid treatment,
further lowering in overpotential (nearly 100 mV positive to that
of Ni–TiO2–CNT) coupled with enhanced current
density (3.7 mA cm–2 at 1600 rpm) was observed because
of the removal of surface nickel with concomitant increase in surface
area and stacking of carbon layers leading to better chemisorptions
of oxygen. Table 3 lists
the ORR activity of the related materials reported in the literature.
The Koutecky–Levich (K–L) analysis was conducted in
order to find out the number of electrons involved in ORR at potential
range 0.6–0.8 V versus RHE following eq 1 1   2  where i = measured current
density (mA cm–2), ik = kinetic current density (mA cm–2), n = number of electron transfer, F = Faraday constant
(96 485 C mol–1), C = concentration
of dissolved oxygen (1.26 × 10–6 mol cm–3), DO = diffusion coefficient
of O2 (1.93 × 10–5 cm2·s–1), υ = kinematic viscosity of the
electrolyte (1.09 × 10–2 cm2·s–1), A = electrode area, and ω
= rpm.37,38

The slope of j–1 versus ω–1/2 plot (Figure 12) was found to be nearly parallel to the
theoretical
four-electron line, and the actual number of electrons transferred
per molecule of O2 was calculated to be 3.4, 2.58, 3.43,
and 3.6 for Ni–TiO2–CNT, acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT, and acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–NCNT, respectively. It is to be noted
that for unwashed samples, the n value is about 3.4,
and for acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT, the n value dropped to 2.58, indicating that Ni that was present
on the surface of the nanotube contributed significantly toward four-electron
transfer.39 For acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT, doped N centers coupled with higher surface
area of the catalyst and encapsulated Ni nanoparticles together contribute
to four-electron ORR and higher limiting current.

A ring potential of 1.23 V versus RHE was applied. From the ring and
disk currents, number of electrons involved and % of HO2– production were estimated from eqs 3 and 4. 3   4

in O2-saturated 0.1 N KOH solution (rotation speed = 1600
rpm, scan rate = 20 mV s–1 and temperature = 25
°C).

Number of electrons obtained from
RRDE analysis is found to be
3.4, 2.45, 3.3, and 3.6 for Ni–TiO2–CNT,
acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT, Ni–TiO2–NCNT, and acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT,
respectively (Figure 14), which corroborated well with the earlier calculation from the
K–L analysis. For the acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT, ∼22% of HO2– production
has been estimated and number of electrons involved is found to be
∼3.6 which is best among the four catalysts. Guo et al.40 studied some highly oriented pyrolitic graphite
model catalysts with well-controlled doping of N-species. By comparing
the N 1s XPS of their model catalysts before and after subjecting
to ORR in 0.1 M H2SO4, the presence of pyridonic
N was confirmed. This species is observed when C atom next to N atom
in pyridinic site reacts with OH species during ORR, converting pyridinic
site to pyridonic site. Their DFT study in combination with local
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM–STS) confirmed C atom next
to N to possess a localized density of states near the Fermi level.40 Hence, we believe that C atom next to N of pyridinic
and pyridine-N-oxide to be the active site for ORR.

From the LSV recorded
at 1600 rpm, mass transfer corrected Tafel
plot has also obtained from eq 5. 5  where i = measured
current
density, ik = kinetic current density,
and iL = the limiting current density.

Tafel analysis was performed in order to find the rate-determining
step. Pt exhibits a Tafel slope of ∼60 mV dec–1 in the lower overpotential region in the alkaline solution.37 In this study, the Tafel slope of ∼60
mV dec–1 (below 0.75 V vs RHE) was obtained for
the acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT (Figure 15a). Taylor and
Humffray reported the Tafel slope to be as 60 mV dec–1 for carbon materials in the alkaline solution (pH > 10).38 At high overpotential, the Tafel slope changes
to 120 mV dec–1, suggesting a change in the ORR
mechanism from Temkin-type adsorption at lower potential to Langmuir
adsorption at high potential.41,42

of acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT in O2-saturated 0.1 N KOH solution.

In order to check the stability of the catalyst, 800 CV cycles
were performed. Figure 15b compares the 1st and 800th cycles, which shows that the
catalyst is highly stable even after 800 cycles. LSV at 1600 rpm has
been recorded initially and after 800 cycles in order to further investigate
the change in current density and onset potential. Current density
after 800 cycles reduced by 200 mA cm–2 but onset
and half wave potential remained constant even after 800 cycles of
operation at 1600 rpm (Figure 15c). Chronoamperometry study has been done for the best
catalyst at 0 rpm in order to see the stability of the catalyst for
100 h at 0.6 V versus RHE, and from Figure 15d, it can be seen that the current has not
changed much (in fact there is a slight increase in current with time)
even after 100 h.

3 Conclusions
Among
the four catalysts studied, the acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT showed the highest BET surface area of 206.47
m2/g (3.05 times higher that of the Ni–TiO2–CNT) as well as highest ORR activity in O2-saturated
0.1 N KOH solutions. Although metal nanoparticles are present inside
the CNTs–NCNTs, there seems to be no metal–nitrogen
bonding at the surface of the CNTs–NCNTs. ORR onset potentials
obtained from the LSV are 0.76 V (Ni–TiO2–CNT),
0.78 V (acid-treated Ni–TiO2–CNT), 0.84 V
(Ni–TiO2–NCNT), and 0.88 V (acid-treated
Ni–TiO2–NCNT) versus RHE. Among these, highest
limiting current density (iL = 3.7 mA
cm–2) is obtained for the acid-treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT and the n value calculated both
from K–L and RRDE analyses is ∼3.6 per oxygen molecule.
In order to demonstrate the stability of the catalysts, 800 CV cycles
were performed in O2-saturated 0.1 N KOH solutions. The
1st and 800th CV cycles showed nearly same activity. Chronoamperometry
performed at 0.6 V versus RHE showed stable ORR performance for 100
h.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Chemicals
Used
Nickel nitrate hexahydrate
(Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), titanium isopropoxide
(Ti(OC3H7)4), isopropyl alcohol (IPA),
CTAB, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Merck. All
chemicals were used as received without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis Process
To synthesize TiO2-supported
nickel, 5.85 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 25 mL of Ti(OC3H7)4, and 0.7
g of CTAB were added in 50 mL of IPA. Then, the
mixture was charged into a 100 mL autoclave and subjected to the solvothermal
process at 120 °C for 48 h. The solid recovered from the process
was reduced using the Ar–H2 mixture at 400 °C
for 4.5 h in a tubular furnace. Thus, the obtained material (Ni–TiO2) was used for growing CNTs through thermal decomposition
of acetylene gas over the catalyst at 700 °C for 20 min in the
presence of argon as a carrier gas. Argon flow (0.16 L/min) was maintained
constant throughout the reaction, and hydrogen flow was maintained
at 0.05 L/min during 500–700 °C. In order to obtain nitrogen-doped
CNTs, acetylene gas was passed through the gas bubbler filled with
acetonitrile solution preheated to 150 °C. As-synthesized samples
were refluxed in concentrated nitric acid for 24 h to remove Ni from
the surface (Scheme 1). It is to be noted that the TiO2 matrix is used to disperse
Ni nanoparticles on it. These fine nickel particles on TiO2 help in increasing the yield of CNT formation. The CNT per gram
(0.4 g) of Ni is formed without TiO2 support, whereas 9
g of CNT per gram of Ni is obtained in the presence of TiO2 matrix.

Ni–TiO2–CNT, and Acid-Treated Ni–TiO2–NCNT
4.3 Physical Characterization
Powder
XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer
fitted with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). All measurements
were recorded in the 2θ range of 20–80°. Vibrational
spectral properties of samples were investigated using a PerkinElmer
FT-IR spectrometer in the range 600–4000 cm–1. Raman spectra were recorded using a Bruker RFS 27 FT-Raman spectrometer
in the range of 50–2000 cm–1 (laser source
wavelength = 632 nm). The SEM images and the energy-dispersive X-ray
spectra (EDAX) were taken employing an Inspect F scanning electron
microscope. TEM images were taken in a Philips CM 12 instrument. TGA
was carried out using SDTQ600 from TA Instruments in air atmosphere
from room temperature to 1000 °C at 20 °C min–1 heating rate. XPS measurements were recorded using an Omicron ESCA
Probe spectrometer fitted with polychromatic Mg Kα X-rays (hν = 1253.6 eV) operated at ultrahigh vacuum (10–9 mbar). X-ray power applied was 300 W.

4.4 Electrochemical Characterization
The catalyst sample
(3 mg) was dispersed in 1.5 mL of IPA–water
solution (1:2 V/V) in an ultrasonic bath to obtain a homogeneous ink.
The Nafion ionomer solution (5 μL; 5 wt %) was then added as
a binder. The catalyst ink was coated on the glassy carbon electrode.
Catalyst loading on the glassy carbon electrode is 170 μg cm–2. Catalyst loading reported in the literature is varied
from 80 to 300 μg cm–2.23,29,43 ORR activity was then studied by CV and
LSV techniques employing 5 mm diameter rotating disk electrode (RDE,
Pine Instruments) and 5.5 mm diameter RRDE, Pine Instruments, (Pt
ring inner and outer diameter are 6.5 and 8.5 mm) coated with catalyst
in O2-saturated 0.1 N KOH solution.
