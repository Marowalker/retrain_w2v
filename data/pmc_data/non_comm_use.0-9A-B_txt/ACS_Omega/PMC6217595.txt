In this study, we synthesized four
novel Al18/19F-labeled
2-phenylbenzothiazole derivatives conjugated to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic
acid via alkyl linkers and evaluated them as imaging agent targets
to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques deposited in the blood vessels
of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) brain. The four ligands exhibited
moderate-to-high binding ability to Aβ1–42 aggregates, of which complex 17 possessing the most
potent affinity (Ki = 11.3 nM) was selected
for further biological evaluations. In vitro fluorescent staining
and in vitro autoradiography studies on brain sections from CAA patients
proved that this ligand could label Aβ deposits in blood vessels
selectively. In biodistribution study, [18F]17 can hardly penetrate the blood–brain barrier (brain2 min = 0.3% ID/g) and displayed a rapid blood washout rate (blood2 min/blood60 min = 25.2), which is favorable
as CAA imaging agents. In conclusion, this Al18F-labeled
2-phenylbenzothiazole complex was developed and proved to be a promising
CAA positron emission tomography agent.

1 Introduction
The
high prevalence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which
is characterized by cerebrovascular deposition of amyloid-β
(Aβ), is associated with not only cognitive impairment but a
major cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly.1−3 Pathological studies suggest that the main difference between CAA
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the location of Aβ deposits,
as AD is recognized as Aβ deposits mainly in the brain parenchyma,
whereas in CAA, the Aβ deposits in the cerebrovascular walls.4 Distinct biological overlaps occur between CAA
and AD; about a quarter of individuals with moderate-to-severe CAA
are present in AD brains.5−7 In addition, CAA is also present
in about 30% of nondemented elderly. Besides conservative biopsy or
autopsy, the clinical diagnosis of CAA almost relied on advanced manifestations
such as hemorrhage or microbleeding and is obviously late and inadequate.8 Due to the common pathogenesis shared by these
two diseases and impending clinical requirements, it is highly significant
to develop noninvasive imaging method for detecting Aβ deposits
in the cerebrovascular walls.

Over the previous decades, considerable
strides have been made
in targeting Aβ plaques in AD. A large amount of effective Aβ-specific
radiotracers have been reported for early diagnosis of AD using positron
emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT). For instance, three 18F-labeled radiotracers (Amyvid,
Neuraceq, and Vizamyl) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in clinic.9−11 However, none of them are able
to distinguish Aβ deposits in two different regions. Among a
number of imaging agents, [11C]PIB was reported to have
the ability to diagnose CAA12−14 but it could also penetrate the
blood–brain barrier (BBB), thus making it hard to spot Aβ
deposits in parenchyma and blood vessels apart.12,15 According to previous studies, CAA could be specifically diagnosed
through reducing the brain uptake of imaging agents.1699mTc-labeled probe is a good choice due to
its relative high molecular weight and multiform of oxidation of 99mTc states to form charged molecules. However, the low spatial
resolution and inaccuracy of quantification for SPECT should not be
ignored. By contrast, PET with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity
could overcome these disadvantages and indeed, some 18F
and 68Ga-labeled stilbene derivatives were reported as
CAA imaging agents; they displayed lower brain uptake and specific
binding to Aβ deposits on blood vessel walls.17,18

Recently, aluminum fluoride (Al–F) complex has got
considerable
attention in radiofluorination of biomolecules. Compared with conventional
radiofluorination strategies, this new Al–18F labeling
method has many advantages, such as a one-pot procedure, which could
be accomplished in water solution within 15 min.19,20 In general, a classical bifunctional penta-dentate 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic
acid (NODA) chelator with three nitrogen atoms and two carboxylates
is ideal for aluminum to form an octahedral complex and leave an exactly
binding site for fluoride ion.21 In addition,
the Al–F coordinate bond is stronger than that with most other
metals22,23 and some Al–18F complexes
are not only highly stable in vivo but also possess biocompatibility
in biosystem.24,25

In this study, to detect
Aβ plaques in cerebrovascular system
selectively, four CAA-targeted ligands were designed and synthesized
with 2-phenylbenzothiazole as Aβ homing group. NODA was conjugated
by different lengths of carbon linker and finally formed stable Al–F
complexes with relatively high molecular weights around 600 Da, which
reduces its ability to penetrate the BBB. Reported in this paper is
the synthesis and biological evaluation of these Al–18F based complexes as specific CAA imaging agents.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
The
synthetic strategies
used for the preparation of Al–19F complexes 14–17 are shown in Scheme 1. tert-Butyl-protected NODA
chelator 1 was prepared by 1,4,7-triazacyclononane and tert-butylbromoacetate in acetonitrile according to the
methods described by Gai et al., with minor modifications.26 Pure disubstituted compound 1 was
obtained by a carefully pH-controlled extraction in 76.6% yield from
the mono- and trisubstituted byproducts. The brominated intermediates 2–5 with different lengths of carbon chains
(n = 3 and 5) and mono- or dimethylamino groups were
prepared from 2-phenylbenzothiazole hydroxyl compounds according to
our previously reported methods.27 Compounds 6–9 were synthesized from protected NODA
chelator and brominated compounds 2–5 in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIEA) as base (yield: 27.6–38.5%). Removal of the protecting
groups using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) led to the dicarboxylic acid
precursors 10–13 in high yield (89.7–93.0%).
The X-ray quality crystal of precursor 13 was obtained
by slow evaporation from N,N-dimethylformamide-methanol
mixed system at room temperature. The ORTEP plot (30%) structure of 13 and its crystallographic data are illustrated in Figure 1 and Table 1. Compound 13 crystallized
in the monoclinic space group P1211; the presence of carbon
chains adjacent to a substituted nitrogen atom insured the binding
of fluoride to aluminum with no other ring-forming interference. Finally,
the Al–19F complex 14–17 was successfully obtained by complexation of 10–13 with AlF3·3H2O
in ethanol and sodium acetate buffer (pH = 4.2) in yields of 29.6–43.9%
and it was characterized by NMR and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS)
analysis.

2.2 Biological Evaluation
2.2.1 In Vitro Fluorescent Staining
To
preliminarily confirm the specific binding of these Al–19F complexes to Aβ plaques, in vitro neuropathological
fluorescent staining was implemented on brain sections from two CAA
patients. As shown in Figures 2 and S1, four ligands displayed
varying degrees of affinity to Aβ deposits in the blood vessel
walls. Ligands with N,N-dimethylamino
group (15, 17) exhibited preferable staining
compared with ligands with N-methylamino group (14, 16), and ligand 17 with longer
length of carbon chain stood out (Figures 2 and S1). In comparison,
no apparent labeling was observed in the brain section of the normal
human (Figure 2G).
The Aβ deposits were further verified by DANIR-3b (a highly
sensitive near-infrared probe for Aβ);28 the fluorescence signals from two different channels merged perfectly
on the same section (Figure 2C,F,I).

filter was used for 17, and red fluorescent protein (RFP)
filter was used for DANIR-3b.

2.2.2 In Vitro Binding Assay Using Aβ Aggregates
The binding affinity of four Al–19F complexes
(14–17) for Aβ1–42 aggregates was assessed quantitatively using [125I]IMPY
as a competing radio ligand by means of inhibition binding assay.
As shown in Table 2, the Ki values of these Al–19F complexes ranged from 11.3 to 124.1 nM. The obtained data
also showed that N,N-dimethylamino
compounds (15, 17) tended to have higher
affinity than that of their corresponding N-methylamino
compounds (14, 16) similar to the trend
observed from another Aβ probe reported previously.29 In addition, similar to our previous results,
with the length of carbon chain extended from n =
3 to 5, the affinity was significantly increased. Under the same assay
conditions, IMPY with Ki values of 4.6
nM proved the experimental system is feasible. Among these complexes, 17 displayed highest binding affinity (Ki = 11.3 nM), which is comparable to that of IMPY. Thus, its
dicarboxylic acid precursor 13 was selected for 18F-labeling and further evaluation.

2.2.3 Radiochemistry
The whole labeling
process could be accomplished in a one-pot reaction in aqueous solution,
which is distinct from the conventional nucleophilic or electrophilic
radiofluorination strategies. As shown in Scheme 2, [18F]17 was obtained
by mixing precursor with (18F–Al)2+,
which was prepared by adding 18F– saline
solution to AlCl3 stock solution in sodium acetate buffer
(pH = 4) at room temperature. In this procedure, the formation of
metal complex depended largely on pH-control and pH value of 4 was
the most suitable condition as reported.21 The decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) based on 18F at the end of synthesis (40 min) was 17.8%; after reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification, [18F]17 was obtained with radiochemical purity
(RCP) higher than 98%. The identification of [18F]17 was further confirmed by coinjection HPLC analysis of retention
time between radiofluorinated tracer and corresponding nonradioactive
complex 17 (Figure 3).

2.2.4 Ex Vivo Biodistribution
In general,
optimized lipophilicity (1.5–4.0) of probe is thought to be
a major factor affecting the BBB penetrability.30 The measured log D value of [18F]17 (0.74 ± 0.004) by shake-flask method is lower
than the optimal coefficient, which means it will be hard to penetrate
BBB. In addition, compared with [18F]GE-067 used as Aβ
imaging probe in brain parenchyma, [18F]17 has more than doubled molecular weight; this further ensures the
decreased brain uptake. Then, ex vivo biodistribution study of [18F]17 was performed in normal ICR mice to evaluate
its BBB penetrability and pharmacokinetic properties. The detailed
time-radioactivity data obtained after intravenous administration
are displayed in Table 3. Consistent with our prediction, the initial brain uptake was significantly
decreased (0.30 ± 0.04% ID/g at 2 min) compared with the FDA
approved Aβ tracers (> 4% ID/g at 2 min). High uptake in
liver
(ranging from 37.71 to 77.17% ID/g) and gradual rising uptake in intestine
(from 5.60 to 37.64% ID/g) during the whole study indicate that [18F]17 was mainly metabolized by the hepatobiliary
system and excreted by intestines. Furthermore, continuingly low levels
of bone uptake observed during the entire investigation (from 1.38
to 3.14% ID/g) indicated the coordination bond of Al–18F was biologically stable against in vivo defluorination.

2.2.5 In
Vitro Autoradiography
To further
demonstrate the specific binding ability of radiofluorinated version
of complex, in vitro autoradiography study of [18F]17 was implemented on brain sections from CAA patient and
healthy control. As shown in Figure 4, autoradiographic images suggested that [18F]17 possessed highly potent binding with Aβ concentrated
at blood vessels of CAA patient; due to the low resolution of autoradiography,
the Aβ occupied blood vessels were displayed as hot spots. In
contrast, the distinct labeling on brain sections of healthy control
was not observed (Figure S3). The same
sections were further stained by DANIR-3b, and the radioactive spots
corresponded well to the fluorescent staining result. These results
further validated that [18F]17 has excellent
binding ability for Aβ deposits in cerebral vessels.

The presence and distribution of plaques were confirmed by fluorescence
staining using DANIR-3b.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
for the first time, four Al18/19F-labeled
2-phenylbenzothiazole complexes with NODA chelator were successfully
designed, synthesized, and evaluated as PET tracers for the detection
of Aβ deposits in CAA brain. The results of competitive binding
assay suggested that complex 17 with dimethylamino group
and longer carbon linker possessed highest binding affinity to Aβ
aggregates. Radiofluorinated tracer [18F]17 was obtained by a one-pot reaction in aqueous solution with high
RCY and RCP. In vitro fluorescent staining and autoradiography studies
showed that [18F]17 could selectively label
Aβ deposits in blood vessels of CAA brain sections. In biodistribution
study, the decreased initial brain uptake and rapid blood washout
rate further confirmed the selectivity of [18F]17 for Aβ deposits in blood vessels. All of these results demonstrated
that [18F]17 could be a promising PET agent
for diagnosis of CAA. However, the design of CAA specific probe is
very complicated, since there are very few reports on this and the
criteria was not fully established; thus, subsequent experiments will
be complemented to verify its further application.

4 Experimental Section

All chemicals used
in synthesis were commercial products without further purification. 18F– was provided by Chinese PLA General
Hospital. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
in CDCl3, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6, or TFA-d solutions on a Bruker Avance III
NMR spectrometer (400/100 MHz) at room temperature. Chemical shifts
are recorded as δ values relative to the internal trimethylsilyl.
Mass spectra (MS) were acquired from a Surveyor MSQ Plus (ESI) (Waltham,
MA) instrument. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were acquired
by Thermo scientific Q-Exactive (ESI) mass spectrometer. Chemical
reactions were monitored by TLC (Silica gel 60 F254 aluminum sheets,
Merck), and compounds were visualized using a hand-held UV lamps with
short wavelengths of 254 and 365 nm. Silica gel (45–75 μm)
used for column chromatography purification was obtained from Qingdao
Haiyang Chemical Co, Ltd. Radio-HPLC purification and analysis was
performed on a Shimadzu system CL-20AVP, with a SPD-20A UV detector
(λ = 254 nm) and a Bioscan flow count 3200 NaI/PMT γ-radiation
scintillation detector. Radioactivity was measured by automatic γ-counter
(WALLAC/Wizard 1470). Fluorescent images were observed by EVOS FL
imaging system (Life Technologies) equipped with DAPI and RFP filter
sets. Synthetic Aβ1–42 was purchased from
Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Postmortem brain tissues from autopsy-confirmed
CAA patients (70 year old, male, temporal lobe; 76 year old, male,
temporal lobe) and a healthy control subject (male, 89 year old, temporal
lobe) were obtained from the Chinese Brain Bank Center. Normal ICR
mice (male, 18–22 g) used for biodistribution study were purchased

4.2.12 General
Procedures for the Synthesis of
Complexes 14–17
Precursors 10–13 (0.2 mmol) were dissolved in a solution
of NaOAc (2 mL,10 mM) and ethanol (1 mL) and treated with AlF3·3H2O (0.6 mmol). After adjusting pH to 4.5–5.0,
the mixture was refluxed for 15 min and cooled down to room temperature
to adjust pH again. The pH was maintained between 4.5 and 5.0 during
the entire process and refluxed overnight. The solvent was removed
by vacuum, and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography
using methanol and dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) to afford complexes 14–17.

4.3 In Vitro
Binding Assay Using Aggregated Aβ1–42 Peptides
The Aβ1–42 aggregation was prepared according
to methods reported previously.31 Competitive
binding assays were carried out
as the procedures below. Borosilicate glass tubes (12 mm × 75
mm) contained aggregated Aβ1–42 aggregation
(100 μL, 0.76 μM), [125I]IMPY (100 μL,
approximately 100 000 cpm), bovine serum albumin solution (700
μL, 0.1% in water), and complex 14–17 (100 μL, 10–4 to 10–9.5 M in ethanol) was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, the mixture
was filtered by Whatman GF/B filters on a Brandel Mp-48T cell harvester
for separating the bound and free radioactivity. The filter sections
with bound [125I]IMPY were counted using a γ-counter.
After repeating three times, the half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) were calculated using GraphPad Prism 4.0, and the
inhibition constant (Ki) values were calculated
with by the Cheng–Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + [L]/Kd).32

4.4 Partition
Coefficient Determination
The log D value of [18F]17 was measured as follows.
After the plastic centrifuge tube
containing presaturated n-octanol (3.6 mL) and phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (0.05 M, 3.0 mL) was added with 18F-labeled
tracer (60 μCi), the mixture was vortexed for 3 min, followed
by 5 min of centrifugation at 3000 rpm. Then, 50 μL of the n-octanol and 500 μL of the buffer were pipetted in
two test tubes for measuring the amount of radioactivity, respectively,
and each measurement was repeated three times. The partition coefficient
was obtained by calculating the logarithm of the ratio from n-octanol versus PBS by the count. Then, the n-octanol layer was repartitioned with vortexing, centrifuging, and
counting protocols until consistent values were obtained.

4.5 In Vitro Fluorescence Staining
Brain
slices from CAA patients were deparaffinized in xylene and washed
with ethanol according to the procedures reported previously. Then,
the slices were incubated in solution of 10% ethanol–water
of Al–19F complexes (1.0 μM) for 5 min and
washed with 50% ethanol–water. Fluorescent images were observed
on an EVOS FL imaging system with a DAPI filter set (excitation, 405
nm). And the same brain slices were stained by DANIR-3b (1.0 μM)
to confirm the localization of Aβ plaques using the same method
with the RFP filter.

4.6 Radiochemistry
18F– loaded on a QMA cartridge was eluted
with 0.5 mL of
saline. The pH of 18F– solution was adjusted
with glacial acetic acid to 4. (Al–18F)2+ was obtained by adding AlCl3 solutions (2 mM, 22.5 μL)
to 18F– saline solution and incubating
for 10 min at ambient temperature. The stock aluminum chloride (2
mM) above was prepared by dissolving ultra pure AlCl3·6H2O in sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 4). Then, the solution
of precursors 13 (500 nmol) in sodium acetate buffer
(0.1 M, 1 mL) was added and the mixture was kept at 110 °C for
10 min. The final product was purified by HPLC (Venusil MP C18 column,
5 μm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, acetonitrile/water = 40:60%, flow
rate = 1 mL/min). The total labeling process took about 40 min with
radiochemical yield up to 17.8%. After HPLC purification, the purity
of labeled tracers was higher than 98%.

4.7 Biodistribution
in Normal Mice
A
saline solution of HPLC-purified [18F]17 (100
μL, 10 μCi, 10% EtOH) was injected to ICR mice (18–22
g, male) via the tail vein. The mice were decapitated to sacrifice
exactly at 2, 10, 30, and 60 min post injection. After dissection,
organs of interest and samples of blood were weighed and measured
by γ-counter. The results were expressed as the percentage of
the injected dose per gram (% ID/g) of blood or organs.

4.8 In Vitro Autoradiography Studies
Brain slices from
CAA patients and normal control were deparaffinized
with xylene and washed by ethanol according to the procedures reported
previously. Thereafter, the slices were incubated with purified [18F]17 (100 μL, 20 μCi) at room temperature
for an hour. Thereafter, they were washed with 40% ethanol–water
for 3 min and then exposed to a phosphorus plate (PerkinElmer) for
40 min. The autoradiographic images were obtained using a storage
phosphor system (PerkinElmer) under 600 dpi resolution. Fluorescent
staining by DANIR-3b was performed on the same slices to further confirm
specific binding afterward.
