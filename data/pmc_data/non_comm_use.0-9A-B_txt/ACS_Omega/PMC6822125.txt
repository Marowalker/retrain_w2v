Among the numerous contaminants of
soil, glyphosate and paraquat
are two of the most widely used herbicides that are commonly detected
in the environment. Soil and sediment contaminated with glyphosate,
paraquat, and other environmental toxins can be mobilized and redistributed
to lawns, vegetable gardens, parks, and water supplies in vulnerable
communities at the site of disasters such as hurricanes and flooding.
Glyphosate and paraquat bind strongly to soils containing clays, making
their bioavailability (bioaccessibility) from these types of soil
very low. Because of their affinity for clay-based soils, it is possible
that montmorillonite clays could be administered as a therapeutic
agent in the diet of animals and humans to decrease short-term exposure
and toxicity. In this study, we investigated the sorption mechanisms
of glyphosate and paraquat onto active surfaces of calcium montmorillonite
(CM) and sodium montmorillonite (SM) clays and derived binding parameters,
including capacity, affinity, and enthalpy. Additionally, we used
these parameters to predict the reduction in bioavailability under
different pH and temperature conditions and to estimate the theoretical
dose of clay that could protect against severe paraquat toxicity and
lethality. Computational modeling and simulation studies depicted
toxin sorption mechanisms at different pH values. Additionally, a
toxin-sensitive living organism (Hydra vulgaris) was used to confirm the safety of the clay and its ability to protect
against toxicity from glyphosate and paraquat. The high efficacy of
CM and SM shown in this study supports the natural binding activity
of glyphosate and paraquat to clay-based soils. Following disasters
and medical emergencies, montmorillonite clays could be administered
by capsules and tablets, or added to food and flavored water, to reduce
toxin bioavailability and human and animal exposures.

==== Body
Introduction
The use of pesticides
is of major importance to agriculture, but
their widespread occurrence and persistence in the environment can
be hazardous to living organisms. Moreover, the potential health hazards
of pesticides (and other environmental contaminants) can be enhanced
by hurricanes and flooding, which can mobilize and redistribute these
chemicals in contaminated soil and sediment, resulting in increased
contamination of food and water at the site of disasters.

Glyphosate
is one of the most commonly used organophosphorus herbicides
to control weeds. An important factor contributing to the dominant
use of glyphosate is the introduction of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant
crops in 1996. Almost 90% of all transgenic crops grown worldwide
are glyphosate-resistant, and the adoption of these crops is increasing
at a steady pace. Its mode of action is by inhibiting enzymes involved
in the synthesis of three amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine.1 Importantly, glyphosate has been shown to bind
tightly to soils, especially those containing montmorillonite clay,2 making its bioavailability (bioaccessibility)
low for uptake by roots and translocation to nearby plants. In soils
with little or no clay in their composition, glyphosate can be bioavailable
to plants.3 The potential risk of glyphosate
exposure is a contemporary and controversial issue. In 2015, glyphosate
was classified as “probably carcinogenic in humans”
by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).4 Case–control studies of occupational exposure in
the United States, Canada, and Sweden found increased risks for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma.5,6 However, other agencies, such as the European
Food Safety Authority, have concluded that the evidence for carcinogenicity
is insufficient.7,8 The risk of occupational exposure
to glyphosate is increased in agricultural workers, and the toxin
can be detected in blood and urine samples from those who are highly
exposed to glyphosate.9

Paraquat
is one of the most widely used herbicides due to its rapid,
contact-dependent killing of weeds and plants and its inactivation
upon reaching the soil. Like glyphosate, its sorption by clay minerals
is believed to be a major mechanism for its inactivation in soil.10 Paraquat has been associated with an increased
risk of Parkinson’s disease.11 It
is also the leading cause of death from pesticide self-poisoning and
is classified as “restricted use” by the US Environmental
Protection Agency. The very high case-fatality rate of paraquat is
due to both its inherent toxicity and the lack of any effective treatment
for exposed individuals.12

Calcium
montmorillonite (CM) clay has been shown to be safe for
short-term consumption in multiple animal models and clinical trials
in the United States and Africa.13−41 Both CM and sodium montmorillonite (SM) are routinely used in animal
feeds as therapy for the mitigation of aflatoxin, worldwide. In this
study, we have characterized the sorption of glyphosate and paraquat
to CM and SM clays and investigated chemical and structural mechanisms
of sorption. Equilibrium isothermal analyses and dosimetry studies
were conducted to derive binding parameters and gain insight into
(1) surface capacities and affinities, (2) potential mechanisms of
sorption, (3) thermodynamics of toxin/surface interactions, and (4)
predicted reduction in bioavailability as a function of the estimated
dose of the sorbent. Additionally, we performed molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and structural analyses of SM in the presence of
glyphosate and paraquat at pH 2 and 7 to study the surface chemistry
of the sorption reaction and the effect of pH. Finally, we used a
toxin-sensitive living organism (Hydra vulgaris) to confirm the safety of CM and SM and their efficacy in reducing
the toxicity of glyphosate and paraquat.

Results
Glyphosate
The molecular representations of toxins
and different forms of glyphosate as a function of pH are shown in Figure 1. Isothermal analysis
of glyphosate sorption onto CM and SM surfaces at 37 °C (T1) in an aqueous solution at pH 2 and 7 are
shown in Figure 2A,B.
The plots fit the Langmuir model as indicated by (1) a good correlation
coefficient (r2 ≥ 0.9), (2) a residual
standard error (rse) ranging from 0.022 to 0.11 indicating a variability
in Qmax data less than 11%, and (3) a
curved shape indicating saturation. Glyphosate sorption onto clay
sorbents showed higher binding capacity at pH 2 (Qmax = 0.71 and 0.96 for CM and SM, respectively) than
at pH 7 (Qmax = 0.26 and 0.41 for CM and
SM, respectively). Isotherms run at 26 °C (T2) (Figure 2C,D) fit the Langmuir model with r2 ≥
0.9 and rse ranging from 0.022 to 0.095, indicating a variability
in Qmax data less than 7%. Binding capacities
at pH 2 (Qmax = 1.27 and 0.9 for CM and
SM, respectively) were also higher than at pH 7 (Qmax = 0.32 and 0.3 for CM and SM, respectively). The calculated
enthalpies for CM were equal to −75 and −33 kJ/mol at
pH 2 and 7, and the enthalpies for SM were equal to −33 and
−41 kJ/mol at pH 2 and 7, respectively. Within the simulations,
glyphosate was primarily bound to clay through its positive amide
group (74%) at pH 7 (Figure 2E, encircled in green). At pH 2, glyphosate was primarily
bound to clay through its positive amide group (51%) or through its
protonated phosphate (43%) (Figure 2E, encircled in green and orange, respectively). Other
binding conformations were observed but with lower probability. The
computationally predicted average residence time per binding event
of glyphosate bound to clay at pH 2 (0.59 ± 1.2 ns with a maximum
duration of 20.08 ns) was longer than the residence time at pH 7 (0.10
± 0.09 ns with a maximum duration of 2.42 ns) (Figure 3).

of instances per residence time bin is calculated as the number of
binding instances for a specific duration over the total number of
binding instances. Error bars represent the standard deviation calculated
over multiple simulation runs.

Using the rearranged Langmuir equation described in Materials and Methods, the toxin bioavailability can be predicted
for combinations of nominal toxin concentration Cnom and clay concentration Cclay. Figure 4A shows
the predicted fraction bioavailable for 30 ppm glyphosate. For glyphosate,
both CM and SM at concentrations of 0.1–0.2% result in the
bioavailability of no more than a few percent. Exposure to glyphosate
resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in hydra
morphology scores (see Supporting Information Figure S1), with complete loss of viability at t ≥ 44 h for C ≥ 40 ppm glyphosate.
The next lowest concentration of 30 ppm glyphosate was selected for
directly testing the effects of clay. Based on the predicted reduction
in bioavailability shown in Figure 4A, with 0.1% CM or SM, the hydra morphology scores
at 30 ppm glyphosate would be ≥9. Figure 4B shows the experimental results of direct
comparisons of the toxin with and without clay. For glyphosate, complete
protection was observed for 0.1% CM, resulting in morphological scores
equal to the hydra media control group. Additionally, only partial
protection from glyphosate toxicity was observed by the heat-collapsed
CM, where the interlayers were dehydroxylated and collapsed.

33% protection was shown from the collapsed CM treatment group at
the end point. Bands indicate 95% confidence intervals on the mean
response.

Paraquat
As shown
in Figure 5A–D,
the isotherm plots for paraquat
fit the Langmuir model with r2 > 0.9
and
rse ranging from 0.026 to 0.055 (indicating a variability in the Qmax data less than 18.9%), high binding capacity
(Qmax = 0.43 and 0.44 for CM and SM, respectively),
and high affinity (Kd = 1.5 × 106 and 2.0 × 106 for CM and SM, respectively).
The thermodynamics at 37 °C (T1)
and 26 °C (T2) showed binding enthalpies
for paraquat sorption onto the surfaces of CM and SM equal to −44
and −32 kJ/mol, respectively. The sorption parameters for glyphosate
and paraquat on CM and SM are summarized in Table 1. Within the simulations, paraquat at both
pH 2 and 7 was bound to the clay through both of its bipyridinium
rings being approximately parallel to the clay surface (90 and 93%,
respectively) (left and right panels of Figure 5E, respectively, encircled in green). The
computationally predicted average residence time per binding event
of paraquat bound to clay was similar at pH 2 and 7 (2.84 ± 6.33
ns with a maximum duration of 39.98 ns, and 4.06 ± 7.45 ns with
a maximum duration of 40.02 ns, respectively).

In Figure 6A, clay
concentrations as low as 0.1–0.2% resulted in a predicted bioavailability
of less than 2% of 20 ppm paraquat. At the same clay concentration,
temperature, and pH, paraquat was predicted to be less bioavailable
than glyphosate. Exposure to paraquat resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent
decrease in hydra morphology scores (see Supporting Information Figure S2), with complete loss of viability at t ≥ 44 h for C ≥ 30 ppm paraquat.
The next lowest concentration of 20 ppm paraquat was selected for
directly testing the effects of clay. Based on the predicted reduction
in bioavailability shown in Figure 6A, with 0.1% CM or SM, complete protection was predicted
for paraquat at 20 ppm. Figure 6B shows the experimental results of direct comparisons of
paraquat without clay and the complete protection observed for both
CM and SM at either 0.1 or 0.2%.

by CM and SM at 0.1 and 0.2% inclusion rates, respectively, was shown
against 20 ppm paraquat (B). Bands indicate 95% confidence intervals
on the mean response.

Discussion
Our
previous results have indicated that CM clay is stable and
safe for short-term animal and human consumption.42,43 Moreover, the inclusion of CM in the diet of humans had no negative
impact on palatability (texture, taste, and odor) or acceptability
of the diet from our clinical trials in Ghana,37 Texas,39 and Kenya.40

In the current study, sorption isotherms
were conducted at 37 °C
(T1) in an aqueous solution at pH 2 and
7 to simulate body temperature and stomach and intestinal pH conditions.
The net negative charge on both CM and SM clays is the primary factor
in clay dispersion, and changes in pH affect clay dispersion by altering
the net charge on clay particles. However, the inclusion rate of clay
in isotherms run at pH 2 and 7 was only 0.002%. We believe that this
very low level excludes the possibility of aggregation effects. The
fact that glyphosate binding capacity at pH 2 (Qmax = 0.71 and 0.96 for CM and SM, respectively) was higher
than at pH 7 (Qmax = 0.26 and 0.41 for
CM and SM, respectively) (Figure 2A,B) may be due to the zwitterionic property of glyphosate
and the resulting structural conformers at different pH values. At
pH 2, glyphosate is expected to be protonated resulting in a net positive
charge.44 Based on our isothermal data,
we hypothesized that the binding of glyphosate at pH 2 is probably
the result of electrostatic interactions of the positively charged
amide group with the negatively charged interlamellar surfaces of
CM and SM and a hydrophobic effect at the protonated carboxyl group
on the toxin. Glyphosate (at pH 7) possesses negative charges resulting
from the deprotonation at the carboxyl and the phosphate groups, resulting
in a less favorable electrostatic interaction. Similarly, the simulations
suggest that glyphosate is primarily bound to clay interlayers through
its positive amide group at pH 2 and 7 (Figure 2E, encircled in green). Due to protonation
at pH 2, the simulations suggest that glyphosate can also bind to
the clay interlayer through hydrogen bond interactions between its
phosphate group and the oxygens of the clay siloxane surface. This
is consistent with previous literatures indicating that phosphate
in the soil can compete with glyphosate for sorption sites and can
reduce the sorption of both compounds, especially in acidic soil.45 Besides electrostatic interactions, it is possible
that interlamellar cations (such as Ca2+) could interact
with oxygens from phosphonic acid and glycine moieties associated
with glyphosate and contribute to the mechanism. More work is warranted
in this area.

To determine the available clay surface area for
binding at saturation
(plateau surface density), we calculated the surface area of active
binding sites on CM and compared it to the maximum binding area of
glyphosate derived from isothermal analysis. The surface area of CM
interlamellar binding sites = 850–70 = 780 m2/g
= 7.8 × 1022 Å2/g. Based on the maximum
binding capacity derived from the isotherms, the number of glyphosate
molecules bound at pH 2 = 0.71 mol/kg × 6.02 × 1023 molecules/mol = 4.3 × 1020 molecules/g (or plateau
surface density). Since the topological polar surface area of one
glyphosate molecule is 113 Å2, the total binding area
for the glyphosate = 4.3 × 1020 × 113 = 4.9 ×
1022 Å2/g, which is smaller than the available
clay surface area (7.8 × 1022 Å2/g).
The plateau surface density and the high binding capacity suggest
that montmorillonite contains more than adequate binding sites for
monolayer sorption, with space left over. The monolayer sorption (instead
of a multilayer phenomenon) is consistent with the curved shape and
homogeneous site requirement of the Langmuir model.

Thermodynamic
analysis of the interaction can determine if the
sorption is physical or chemical, spontaneous or nonspontaneous, and
also exothermic or endothermic. To calculate binding enthalpy, isotherms
were conducted at both 37 °C (T1)
and 26 °C (T2), and then the derived Kd values were applied in the van’t Hoff
equation. Figure 2C,D
shows isothermal sorption at 26 °C (T2) onto CM and SM. The high enthalpy values indicate that surface
interaction involves tight binding at active sites (i.e., chemisorption),
instead of weak interactions or physisorption (less than 20 kJ/mol).
Our thermodynamic data is consistent with the high stability of the
clay/toxin complex and low toxin desorption. These results suggest
that glyphosate should bind strongly in the stomach, with sustained
binding in the intestine. Both binding sites for glyphosate have high
capacity and high affinity and involve chemisorption interactions.
The isothermal and thermodynamic analyses were similar for glyphosate
binding to CM and SM.

Additionally, we rearranged the Langmuir
equation to predict the
bioavailability of glyphosate as a function of nominal toxin concentration
and clay concentration. Based on the predicted reduction in glyphosate
bioavailability shown with 0.1% CM or SM (Figure 4A), the glyphosate hydra morphology scores
at 30 ppm would be predicted to be ≥9. The hydra data in Figure 4B showed that CM
at the inclusion rate of only 0.1% completely protected hydra against
a 30 ppm glyphosate toxicity, resulting in morphological scores no
different from the hydra media control group. This protection is in
alignment with the high binding capacity, affinity, and enthalpy for
glyphosate sorption onto the surfaces of CM. Interestingly, only partial
protection was observed by the heat-collapsed CM, where the interlayers
were dehydroxylated and collapsed. This is indirect evidence that
the main site of sorption for glyphosate is found within the CM interlayer
on negatively charged surfaces.

Paraquat is another herbicide
naturally bound by soils containing
clays. It is widely used in agriculture and also used as an agent
for suicide due to its potent toxicity.11,12 Because paraquat
has permanent positive charges on the quaternary nitrogens that are
not pH-dependent, isotherms were conducted at pH 7 in water. As shown
in Figure 5A,B, the
high binding capacity of paraquat at 37 C (T1) onto both CM and SM indicates that the maximum concentration
of paraquat bound (Qmax) is 0.44 mol/kg
× 6.02 × 1023 molecules/mol = 2.6 × 1020 molecules/g. Since the topological polar surface area of
one paraquat molecule is equal to 7.8 Å2, the coverage
area (plateau surface density) for the maximum amount of paraquat
bound is equal to 2.6 × 1020 × 7.8 = 2 ×
1021 Å2/g, which is an order of magnitude
smaller than the surface area of clay available for binding (7.8 ×
1022 Å2/g). This data and the high binding
capacity of paraquat (like glyphosate) suggest that montmorillonite
clay contains more than adequate binding sites for monolayer coverage,
with space left over. This sorption of paraquat was also tight (i.e.,
chemisorption), as suggested by the thermodynamics of the reaction
at 37 °C (T1) and 26 °C (T2) (Figure 5C,D). The predominant binding conformations for paraquat
indicate that toxin binding to the clay interlayers at pH 2 and 7
was nearly identical within the simulation. This suggests that the
sorption of paraquat was unaffected by pH. Simulations indicate that
paraquat primarily binds to clay with both bipyridinium rings being
approximately parallel to the surface (Figure 5E, encircled in green).

As with glyphosate,
we rearranged the Langmuir equation to predict
the bioavailability of paraquat as a function of nominal toxin concentration
and clay concentration (Figure 6A). The hydra bioassay (Figure 6B) confirms that CM and SM at an inclusion rate of
only 0.1% were able to prevent the toxicity of 20 ppm paraquat, which
resulted in 100% lethality in hydra without clays. At the same clay
concentration, the predicted bioavailability of paraquat is even lower
than that of glyphosate. In line with this result, the computationally
derived distributions of residence time per binding events suggest
that paraquat has a higher probability to retain a bound conformation
compared to glyphosate at pH 2 and 7 (Figure 3). Thus, bound paraquat molecules are less
likely to desorb from the clay, thereby presumably decreasing toxin
bioavailability in the presence of clay. This may be attributed to
the two positively charged nitrogens in the paraquat bipyridinium
rings, as well as its planar structure, allowing both nitrogens to
simultaneously form favorable electrostatic interactions with the
negatively charged clay surfaces. It is worth noting that the computationally
predicted residence time per binding event should be considered an
underestimate of the total dwell time of a compound within a clay
as the former considers a single binding event, whereas the latter
considers an aggregate time of multiple binding events. Due to the
potent toxicity of paraquat and the incidence of paraquat poisoning,
we predicted (from the Langmuir equation) the theoretical amount of
clay that would be needed to reduce the bioavailability of a lethal
level of paraquat (35 ppm)46 by 99.9%.
The predicted concentration of CM to protect against 35 ppm paraquat
was equal to 0.2% w/w or 2 g clay/kg. Assuming the ingestion of 35
mg of paraquat during an emergency, 2 g of CM could be administered
using gavage, capsules, tablets, or flavored water to reduce human
or animal exposures. Our results suggest that CM binds to paraquat
very effectively, and this clay (or similar clays) could be effective
as toxin enterosorbents during emergencies. In further work, we are
investigating the sorption of other substances and using MD simulations
and computational methods to design effective clay-based sorbents
for the mitigation of hazardous Superfund chemicals.

Based on
a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies,
CM and SM clays were found to be effective sorbents with high binding
capacities, affinities, and enthalpies for glyphosate and paraquat.
These studies suggest that effective levels of montmorillonite clays
can be used to reduce human and animal exposures to toxins from contaminated
food and water during disasters and emergencies. These clays may also
facilitate the treatment of lethal doses of paraquat in humans and
animals.

Materials and Methods
Materials and Reagents
Ca2+/Na+-montmorillonite with 20% (or more) sodium behaves
qualitatively
as a sodium montmorillonite clay (SM), whereas montmorillonite with
90% (or more) calcium in the interlayer behaves similarly to calcium
montmorillonite (CM).47 CM clay was purchased
from Engelhard Chemical Corporation (and is now available from BASF
in Lampertheim, Germany) with a total surface area as high as 850
m2/g, an external surface area of approximately 70 m2/g, and a cation exchange capacity equal to 89.2 cmol/kg.48 SM clay was obtained from the University of
Missouri-Columbia with a cation exchange capacity equal to 90.5 cmol/kg.
The generic formula for these clays is (Na,Ca)0.3(Al,Mg)2Si4O10(OH)2·nH2O. The molecular models of CM and SM have
been constructed in silico and published by our laboratory, along
with important physicochemical properties of CM and SM clays based
on X-ray fluorescence analysis.49 From
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of CM, trace levels of feldspars and mica
were identified; XRD of SM showed 2.1% mica, 0.8% iron oxides, and
trace levels of other mineral impurities.50,51 To investigate the importance of intact interlamellar spaces, montmorillonite
clay was collapsed by heating samples at 200 °C for 30 min and
800 °C for 1 h.52 Reagents for high-pressure
liquid chromatography (HPLC) including acetonitrile, ammonium acetate,
and pH buffers (4.0, 7.0, and 10.0) were purchased from VWR (Atlanta,
GA). Glyphosate and paraquat were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint
Louis, MO).

Analytical Chemistry
Glyphosate
and paraquat were analyzed
using a Waters Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) equipped with triple quadrupole.
For glyphosate, an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 5 μm)
was used for separation and kept at 20 °C. A gradient elution
using water with 0.1% formic acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile with
0.1% formic acid (eluent B) was carried out at a flow rate of 0.3
mL/min. The gradient program for elution was 5% eluent B (initial)
and 5–100% eluent B (from 0 to 10 min). Formic acid in the
mobile phase was used to promote protonation of the amino group. The
injection volume was 10 μL for each analysis. The mass spectrometer
was used with electrospray ionization (ESI) interface and operated
in a negative ion mode. The spray voltage was maintained at 4.5 kV.
The source temperature was kept at 225 °C. The monitored precursor
and product ions were m/z 168 to
63 and 81.53 Paraquat was detected using
a HILIC column (2.1 × 100 mm, 3 μm) at 30 °C. Separation
using a mobile phase containing 10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic
acid (eluent A) and acetonitrile (eluent B) was carried out at a flow
rate of 0.2 mL/min and an injection volume of 10 μL. The gradient
program was used for elution: 60% eluent B (initial), 60–20%
eluent B (from 0 to 7 min), and 20% eluent B (7–8 min). The
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in a positive mode
with a capillary voltage at 4.5 kV. The source temperature was kept
at 350 °C. Positively charged molecular ions of paraquat were
monitored for precursor and products at m/z 186 to 171 and 155.54 For both
methods, the mass spectrometer was operated under multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode. Nitrogen gas was used as the collision and
curtain gas, and argon gas was used as the nebulizer and heater gas.
Empower analyst software was used to control the LC/MS/MS system and
acquire the data.

The limits of detection (LOD) for glyphosate
and paraquat were 0.5 ppb and 10 ppb, respectively, with excellent
reproducibility and sensitivity of the detection methods. Standard
toxin solutions were spiked before and after 2 h of agitating, and
the relative standard deviations (RSD) were <4%, showing a high
recovery percentage and limited nonspecific binding. The detection
methods were validated using standard calibration curves. Standard
solutions of glyphosate and paraquat were prepared in distilled water
at concentration gradients between 20 and 0.5 ppm to plot the standard
curves. The standard curves for glyphosate and paraquat were linear
(r2 > 0.99) between signal intensity
(y axis) and toxin concentration (x axis)
and were described by the following equations: y =
32 185x + 41 034 and y = 106x–720 669, respectively.

Sorption Isotherm Experiments
The toxin stock solutions
were individually prepared by dissolving pure crystals into distilled
water to yield 12 ppm (μg/mL) glyphosate and 5 ppm paraquat
solutions. The stock concentrations were set based on chemical solubility
in water to prevent the occurrence of precipitation and the optimal
ratio of toxin/clay to reach saturation (equilibrium) on isotherm
plots. For isothermal analysis, 0.002% w/w of adsorbents were added
to toxin solutions with an increasing gradient. The concentration
gradients of toxin solutions were achieved by adding a calculated
amount of toxin stock solution along with a complementary volume of
distilled water at pH 2 and 7 for glyphosate and pH 7 for paraquat.
Additionally, there were three controls consisting of distilled water,
toxin solution without an adsorbent, and 0.002% adsorbent in distilled
water. The control and test groups were agitated at 1000 rpm on an
IKA electric shaker (VIBRAX VXR basic, Werke, Germany) for 2 h at
body temperature (37 °C) and ambient temperature (26 °C)
for thermodynamic experiments. All samples were then centrifuged at
2000g for 20 min to separate the clay/toxin complex
from solution.

From equilibrium isotherms, the toxin concentration
in solution was detected by LC/MS/MS and was calculated from the peak
area at the toxin retention time. The amount sorbed for each data
point was calculated from the concentration difference between test
and control groups. These data were then plotted using Table-Curve
two-dimensional (2D) and a computer program that was developed using
Microsoft Excel to derive values for the variable parameters.48,55 The best fit for the data was a Langmuir model, which was used to
plot equilibrium isotherms from triplicate analysis.55 The isotherm equation was entered as user-defined functions Langmuir model
 q = toxin adsorbed (mol/kg), Qmax = maximum
capacity (mol/kg), Kd = distribution constant, Cw = toxin equilibrium concentration

In
Table-Curve 2D, estimates for the Qmax and Kd were taken from the double-logarithmic
plot of the isotherm. The plot displays a break in the curve. The
value on the x axis where the curve breaks is an
estimate of Kd–1. The
value on the y axis where the curve breaks is an estimate of Qmax.48,5648,56 The Qmax was taken from the fit of the
Langmuir model to the sorption data. The definition of Kd was given by  The enthalpy
(ΔH) was
a thermodynamic parameter indicating the total heat released or absorbed
during the sorption reaction. It was calculated from the van’t
Hoff equation by comparing individual Kd values at different temperatures (37 and 26 °C) Van’t Hoff equation

Molecular
Modeling of Glyphosate and Paraquat Sorptions onto
Clay Surfaces
The montmorillonite clay structure used in
this study with the stoichiometry (Si4)IV(Al1.67Mg0.33)VIO10(OH)2 was modeled based on atomic coordinates from the Interface MD model
database.57,58 At pH 7, the structure of a single 2.5 nm
layer (5 × 3 × 1) was extracted from the database and periodically
replicated to build a single 5 nm layer (10 × 6 × 1). At
pH 2, the structure of a single 5 nm (10 × 6 × 1) layer
with neutral SiOH and aluminate edges was extracted from the database.57,58 Subsequently, for the clay model at both pH 2 and 7, the single
5 nm layers were independently replicated to form a second layer with
a d001 spacing of 21 Å.52,59 The layered montmorillonite then was solvated in a 90 Å3 water box with 48 individual glyphosate or paraquat molecules
distributed in random configurations and orientations. The initial
molecular structures of glyphosate at pH 7 and paraquat at pH 2 and
7 were extracted from the ZINC database.60 The protonated glyphosate at pH 2 was generated by adding hydrogens
to the molecular structure at pH 7 using UCSF Chimera.61 Random configurations of glyphosate and paraquat
originated from short 1 ns simulations of the single molecules at
infinite dilution using the generalized Born with a simple switching
implicit solvent model.62

Multi-ns
MD simulations were performed in CHARMM63 for each modeled system (SM in the presence of glyphosate at pH
7, SM in the presence of glyphosate at pH 2, SM in the presence of
paraquat at pH 7, and SM in the presence of paraquat at pH 2). Prior
to MD simulations, each system was first energetically minimized and
equilibrated to adjust the models to the applied molecular mechanics
force field. The energetic minimizations were implemented through
500 steps of steepest descent minimization, 500 steps of adopted Newton–Rapson
minimization, and 500 steps of steepest descent minimization. The
modeled systems were equilibrated for 1 ns. During the energy minimization
and equilibration stages, the montmorillonite layers and either paraquat
or glyphosate were constrained using 1 kcal mol–1 Å–1 harmonic constraints on all heavy atoms.
Then, all constraints were released, and the modeled systems were
simulated for 50 ns under a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of
1 atm. The SHAKE algorithm64 was used to
constrain hydrogen bond lengths. MD simulation snapshots were extracted
at 20 ps intervals for subsequent analysis. Five replicate 50 ns MD
simulations were performed for each modeled system, each with different
initial velocities, for an aggregate of 200 ns per system. All energy
minimizations and MD simulations were performed using CHARMM, v41b1.

Parameters and topologies within the simulations were extracted
from the INTERFACE force field.57 The INTERFACE
force field can operate as an extension of several commonly used harmonic
force fields, including CHARMM,61 thus
enabling simulations of toxin binding on organic/biomolecular and
inorganic interfaces,65−69 including montmorillonite.58 The topologies
of glyphosate and paraquat were generated through CGENFF70 with low penalties using the molecular structures
of the two molecules at pH 2 and 7. The CHARMM36 force field71 was used to model the water and counter ions.

Structural Analysis and Classification of Glyphosate and Paraquat
Binding Conformations
In-house FORTRAN programs and modules
were developed to perform a structural analysis on the MD simulation
snapshots. The analysis was aimed to explore the binding properties
and extract the most prominent binding modes of glyphosate and paraquat
to SM at pH 2 and 7. After ∼5 ns, the systems reached equilibrium,
based on the convergence of the number of instances at which a toxin
was in contact with the clay interlayer. Thus, in the analysis, the
first 5 ns of the simulation was considered as an additional equilibration
stage, and the following 45 ns of each of the five replicate simulations
were analyzed, with snapshots extracted every 20 ps.

As the
clay layers were stable and did not undulate throughout the simulations,
two planes were defined to represent the two clay layers based on
the aluminum atoms at the center of each clay layer (Figure 1, solid black line). A binding
event between glyphosate or paraquat molecules with the clay interlayer
was recorded when at least two of their nonhydrogen atoms were within
6.5 Å of either plane. The 6.5 Å cutoff accounts for the
distance between the plane and the surface (3 Å) and a 3.5 Å
distance cutoff. In addition, the residence time between any of the
two molecules and clay interlayer was recorded when glyphosate or
paraquat was bound to the clay for a minimum of 40 ps with an analysis
resolution of 20 ps. While recording “residence time per binding
event”, a grace period of 20 ps was allowed, which accounts
for any instances where the compound may spontaneously lose contact
to SM and then regain contact in the same binding mode.

To identify
the most prominent binding modes of glyphosate and
paraquat to SM within the simulations, a statistical analysis was
performed on the interactions between the clay interlayer and toxins.
The binding conformations of glyphosate or paraquat molecules to the
SM interlayer were classified into binding modes based on which set
of atoms were in contact with the interlayer surface. Glyphosate was
divided into three sets of atoms: the phosphate group, the central
carbons and amide group, and the carboxyl group. Paraquat was divided
into four sets of atoms: the methyl group, the nitrogens and carbons
at the para positions of the aromatic rings, the carbons at the ortho
and meta positions of one side of the aromatic rings, and the carbons
at the ortho and meta positions of the opposite side of the aromatic
rings (Figure 1). Upon
iterative analysis, certain geometric criteria were defined to cluster
the binding conformations into different binding modes. Thus, structurally
similar binding conformations were categorized into the same binding
mode, while different conformations were categorized in distinct binding
modes. The analysis was performed independently for glyphosate and
paraquat at pH 2 and 7.

Predicted Bioavailability
The Langmuir
model can be
rearranged to predict the freely available fraction of toxin as follows.
Noting that for a nominal (total) concentration Cnom and clay concentration Cclay, the value of q = (Cnom – Cw)/Cclay, the Langmuir model can be rearranged so that free concentration Cw is given by the solution of the quadratic
equation  Thus, Cw can be
predicted using the quadratic formula (taking the positive root).
The predicted percent bioavailability is then given by dividing by
the nominal concentration: 100 × Cw/Cnom.

Hydra Bioassay
H. vulgaris was obtained from Environment
Canada (Montreal) and maintained at
18 °C. The hydra classification method72 was used with modification73 to rate
the morphology of the adult hydra as an indicator of toxicity and
involves a scoring system from 0 to 10, with 10 being “unaffected”.
Mature and nonbudding hydra of similar size were chosen for testing
to minimize differences between samples. All test solution tubes were
capped and prepared by shaking at 1000 rpm for 2 h and centrifugation
at 2000g for 20 min prior to exposure of hydra to
the toxin in pyrex dishes. All experiments were conducted with three
hydra per treatment or control group.

To establish the dose
and time dependences of response to toxins alone, experiments were
first conducted with glyphosate (0, 10, 30, 40, and 60 ppm) and paraquat
(0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 ppm), with hydra morphological response scored
and recorded at 0, 4, 20, 28, 44, 68, and 92 h.74,75 The concentration (C)–time (t)–response (y) relationship was fit to both
a power-exponential and a Hill model    The responses
at C = 0 and t = 0 time were constrained
to be 10, because all untreated
hydra were uniformly unaffected. Model fitting was conducted using
nonlinear least squares (nls function in the R statistical software,
version 3.4.2); model fits were compared using the AIC, and confidence
intervals were calculated based on Monte Carlo estimates from the
R package propagate. Additionally, to predict the effect of sorbents,
the response was calculated based on the predicted bioavailability
(described above) at different nominal concentrations Cnom and different clay concentrations Cclay.

Based on the response to toxins alone and
bioavailability predictions,
subsequent testing was performed at concentrations of 30 ppm glyphosate
and 20 ppm paraquat, with and without cotreatment with sorbent at
0.1 or 0.2%. Responses were scored and recorded at the same time points
as mentioned above from 0 to 92 h. A comparison between different
treatment and control groups was conducted by comparing confidence
intervals from fitting a linear model in time.
