Herein,
metal–organic framework (MOF)-5 crystals were grown
on cellulose-based substrates including paper and cotton. Dopamine
was used as a surface modification agent to improve the compatibility
between MOF-5 crystals and the used substrates. The formed polydopamine
film promoted the growth of MOF-5 crystals, which were bonded to the
substrates. Besides dopamine, the structure of the substrate also
played a major role in the crystal growth. In the case of paper, which
had a structure with fibers closely packed to each other, MOF-5 crystals
grew only on the surface of fibers (one side) and could easily fall
off. Unlike paper, the cotton bulb had a looser structure and MOF-5
crystals grew around the fibers, forming a stable “necklace”
morphology. The effects of dopamine modification on the crystal growth
and the formation of “necklace” morphology were investigated
using scanning electron microscopy analysis. The crystalline structure
of MOF-5 was confirmed using X-ray diffraction. To determine how firmly
crystals were attached to the cotton fibers, the substrates were exposed
to a constant and strong air flow. It was found that the dopamine-modified
cotton increased the strength of MOF-5 crystals attached to fibers.
This work demonstrated the firm attachment of MOF-5 crystals onto
the substrate, facilitating various potential applications.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline
porous materials made by linking metal ions and organic ligands. Because
of their well-defined structure and functionality, these porous materials
have received a great research attention over the recent years.1−3 Their large and accessible surface area up to 7000 m2 g–1 is one of the most important characteristics.4 Tunable pore properties, various active sites,
and thermal stability offer MOF materials’ potential applications
for gas storage and separation,5,6 catalysis,7,8 and drug delivery systems.9 Applying
MOFs for filtration of toxic gases and for air purification has become
a hot research topic because of the increasing global air pollution.10−13 Despite all of the properties that MOFs possess, these materials
are usually obtained as powders and this form limits their applications.
To overcome this, many methods to process the MOF crystals into various
structures were reported, that is, MOF thin films14 and membranes.15 Recently, it
became more popular to grow MOF crystals from the surface of different
fibers made by electrospinning processes.16−19 Supporting MOF crystals onto
commercially available, cost-effective, and eco-friendly substrates
provides an effective approach to expand their potential applications.
One of the best candidates is cellulose-based substrates.

Cellulose
is one of the widely used, renewable, and natural polymers.
Cellulose fibers, whiskers, or cellulose nanocrystals have a broad
range of applications in filtration, textile industry, biomedicine,
and as a reinforcing filler in adhesives.20−22 Good mechanical
properties, low cost, abundance, good processability, and easy recycling
ensure their use in the fabrication of various composite materials.
However, because of cellulose polar and hydrophilic nature, cellulose
compatibility with nonpolar and hydrophobic materials is limited.23 To improve adhesive properties of cellulose-based
substrates and ensure the growth of MOF crystals, the surface must
be modified.24

Dopamine (DA) has
been used as a surface modification agent for
various substrates, and it is inspired by the chemistry of proteins
in marine mussels.25−27 The ability of mussels to attract foreign objects
is originated from proteins, which are rich in catechol groups from
3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine and lysine (amine) groups.28,29 The same functional groups can be found in small-molecule DAs which
can polymerize under mild conditions and can be applied to almost
all kinds of surfaces via amine and catechol functional groups.30 Although the mechanism of DA self-polymerization
into polyDA (PDA) is complex and is yet to be understood,31 an effective surface modification can be achieved
by simple treatment of substrates with buffered DA solution at ambient
temperature. On the surface of treated substrates, a thin polymer
film is formed and its thickness is a function of immersion time.
Our group has reported the use of DA for surface modification of various
substrates and the growth of MOF-5 thin films on PDA as a nucleation
center.32 PDA coated onto the surface of
substrates significantly promoted the growth of MOF-5 crystals, facilitating
the attachment of MOF crystal seeds to the substrate surface. Except
for the adhesive ability to attach MOF-5 crystals, catechol groups
on polymerized DA can bind with metal ions and form a metal–catecholate
coordination complex.28,33,34 This simple fabrication of MOF-5 films was accomplished by simply
immersing substrates into a MOF-5 mother solution.

In this work,
we report a facile method to grow MOF-5 crystals
around cellulose-based fibers. The growth of MOF crystals on cellulose
fibers by various methods has been reported in the literature. Deposition
of HKUST-1 crystals on pulp fibers was reported through in situ synthesis
of MOF in the presence of pulp fibers.35 Different degrees of surface coverage were obtained depending on
the chemical composition of fibers. Reynolds et al.36 reported immobilization of CuBTC crystals on cotton substrates
via functionalization of the cotton surface with carboxylate linkers
and immersing the modified substrate in a MOF mother solution. It
was demonstrated that the modification played a vital role in the
coverage of the substrate surface. Hinestroza et al.37 presented chemical attachment of MOF-199 onto cotton fibers.
All of these works showed that MOF crystals grow on the surface of
cellulose-based substrates. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there has been no report on a “necklace” morphology,
that is, the growth of crystal around cotton fibers. MOF-5 crystals
were firmly attached to the fiber, whereas the large surface of the
crystals remains free.

Experimental Section
Materials
Zinc
nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), terephthalic acid (98%),
DA hydrochloride, and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris, 99.8%)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) was purchased from Caledon, CA. All
chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water
was used throughout all the experiments.

Two different substrates
were used in the experiments: paper strips and cotton bulbs. The paper
was a coffee filter paper (GK Connaisseur 03-2644637 from Dollarama
in CA). Commercially available cotton balls made for medical uses
were used.

Substrate Modification
Paper was
cut into rectangular
strips, and cotton was washed with acetone and dried at room temperature.
DA solution was made by dissolving DA hydrochloride in 200 mL of Tris
aqueous solution (10 mM). The amounts of DA dissolved in 200 mL of
Tris were 400 and 1000 mg. The substrates were immersed in the two
DA solutions having different concentrations and left at room temperature
for 24 h. The modified paper and cotton were washed with deionized
water and ethanol three times to remove residual DA and dried in a
vacuum oven at 65 °C for 24 h. To compare how MOF-5 crystals
were attached to substrates without PDA, pristine paper and cotton
were used. The paper strips and cotton bulbs were only washed with
acetone and dried at room temperature.

Preparation of MOF-5 Mother
Solution
MOF-5 mother solution
was prepared as follows. First, 4.239 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.9072 g of terephthalic acid were
dissolved in 135 mL of DMF. Transparent mother solution was then heated
to 65 °C and kept for 48 h. After temperature was raised to 105
°C, the mother solution was left for additional 72 h at the temperature.
The mother solution stayed transparent where generated MOF crystals
were settled at the bottom of the beaker (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). MOF-5 crystals were
cooled down to room temperature, washed with DMF, and dried in vacuo
at 65 °C.

Preparation of MOF@Paper Structures
The modified paper
was immersed in the MOF-5 mother solution and remained for 3 days
at 65 °C. After that, the sample was rinsed with DMF and dried
in vacuo at 65 °C.

Preparation of MOF@Cotton Structures
The modified cotton
was immersed in the MOF-5 mother solution and kept in the mother solution
for 3 days. In one set of experiments, the temperature was 65 °C,
whereas in the other, it was increased to 105 °C and left for
72 h. Prepared MOF crystals were attached to the cotton bulb (Figure
S1B, Supporting Information), and the mother
solution stayed transparent. All samples were washed with DMF and
dried in vacuo at 65 °C.

Characterization
JEOL JSM 7000 scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was used to characterize morphologies of the obtained structures.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization was done on Thermal
Nicolet 6700. Samples were scanned 64 times, and spectra were obtained
with wavelengths from 4000 to 500 cm–1. Gas sorption
data were collected using a Quantachrome Instrument (v 5.2) at 77
K measuring nitrogen adsorption. Samples were previously degassed
for 24 h at 393 K. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed
using a Mettler TGA/DSC 3+ thermogravimetric analyzer. Thermograms
were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C/min between 37 and 600
°C in a flow of argon at 20 mL/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of
MOF@substrate structures was carried out on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder
diffractometer with a scan speed of 1° min–1, a step size of 0.01°, and a 2θ range of 2–45°.

Stability Test
To investigate the stability of MOF@cotton
structures, the structures were exposed to a constant airflow at 18
L/min, three times for 20 s until a constant mass was reached (Supporting Information, Table S1). The present
of the saved mass was calculated using the following equation 1  where m (MOF@cotton) was
the mass of structures before air blow, m1 (MOF@cotton) was the mass of structures after exposure to air flow
3 × 20 s.

Results and Discussion
Two commercially
available cellulose-based substrates, namely,
paper strips (paper) and cotton bulks (cotton), were treated with
DA to modify the surface of the substrates and to ensure adhesion
of the MOF-5 crystals. MOF-5, as one of the most studied MOFs, was
chosen for the crystal growth onto the substrates because of its thermal
stability and large and accessible surface area.38,39 This isoreticular MOF is inexpensive and easy to synthesize in various
ways.38,40,41 The structure
of the modified cellulose substrates has a significant effect on the
attachment of MOF-5 crystals nurtured from a mother solution to the
fibers. It was found that MOF-5 crystals could grow only on the paper
surface (one side of the paper substrate) and were easy to fall detached,
whereas in the case of cotton, stable crystalline structures around
individual fibers were formed. Apart from the substrate structure,
the influences of DA solution concentration and MOF-5 nurture temperature
on the crystal growth and morphology were studied. The morphology
of MOF-5@substrate structures was investigated using SEM, and the
crystal structure of MOF-5 was confirmed by XRD. Quantitative measurements
were performed to determine how firmly MOF-5 crystals were attached
to the cellulose-based fibers.

The fabrication of MOF-5@substrate
structures is schematically
represented in Figure 1. For simplicity, the schematic displays fabrication steps using
the cotton bulbs (Figure 1A) and the same procedure was applied to the paper strips.
The first step was substrate modification by DA hydrochloride solutions
of two different concentrations (Figure 1B). The DA solutions were prepared by dissolving
DA hydrochloride in 200 mL of Tris aqueous solution (10 mM). The prepared
concentrations of DA in Tris were 2 and 5 mg/mL. Cotton bulbs were
treated with DA solution for 24 h at room temperature. Upon treatment,
the modified bulbs were dried in vacuo at 65 °C for 24 h (Figure 1C). For control experiments,
nonmodified substrates were used after being rinsed with acetone and
dried at room temperature. An obvious difference in observation of
the substrates, treated with and without DA, was the change of their
color from white to dark gray (Figure S1C, Supporting Information). This change in color indicated that PDA was formed
and coated the cellulose-based substrates.42

cotton bulb (gray color represents a color change of the substrate
upon treatment with DA), (D) treatment with MOF-5 mother solution,
and (E) cotton bulb with MOF-5 crystals.

In the next step, we prepared MOF-5 mother solution through
a straightforward
method, using the recipe reported by Fischer et al.43 Zinc nitrate hexahydrate and terephthalic acid were dissolved
in DMF. The final step was the growth of MOF-5 crystals onto paper
and cotton substrates (Figure S2A,B respectively).
The substrates were immersed in MOF-5 mother solutions and kept for
3 days, at 65 °C (Figure 1D). To investigate the temperature effect on the crystal growth,
another set of substrates was kept in MOF-5 mother solution at 105
°C. In both cases, the prepared samples were rinsed with DMF
and dried in vacuo at 65 °C for 24 h, after which MOF-5 crystals
could be observed on the substrates by the naked eyes (Figure 1E).

The effect of DA
solution concentration on MOF-5 crystal growth
and their binding to the substrate were investigated. The results
showed that the pristine paper substrate (no DA) treated with MOF-5
mother solution (Figure 2A) was almost free of MOF-5 crystals, that is, very few crystals
were formed on the paper surface. On the other hand, the DA-modified
paper substrate was densely covered with MOF-5 crystals of more than
100 μm in size, as it can be seen by the SEM image in Figure 2B. The modification
with DA and consequently formed PDA clearly improved compatibility
of the paper substrates with MOF-5, which promoted the crystal growth.
The hydrophilic character of cellulose was reduced by reaction between
hydroxyl groups on the surface and catechol groups of DA. The formed
PDA layer on the surface of substrates also became a nucleation site
of MOF-5 crystals. Although DA contributed to the greater coverage
of the paper surfaces, it was difficult, if not impossible, to grow
MOF-5 crystals around fibers of the cellulose paper because of space
limitation effects. The paper substrate had a dense structure where
fibers were close to each other and crystals could not grow within
the fibers. Consequently, MOF-5 crystals could easily fall off the
paper substrates, regardless of the modification with DA. In contrast,
the experiments performed with the cotton bulbs gave a very different
morphology. The loose fibrous structure of the cotton bulbs proved
to be a better choice for the nucleation and growth of MOF-5 crystals.

of MOF-5@substrate (temperature of the crystal growth
was 65 °C). (A) MOF-5 crystals on the pristine paper (no DA),
(B) MOF-5 crystals on the paper modified with DA, (C) MOF-5 growing
around cotton fibers, and (D) “necklace” morphology
(the scale bar is 100 μm).

Unlike the crystals that grew only on fibers at the paper
surface,
the crystals grown on fibers of the cotton bulb (inside-out of the
bulb) wrapped the fibers, forming a unique morphology with the crystals
firmly attached to the fibers (Figure 2C). To the best of our knowledge, there has been no
work reported on growing MOF crystals around cotton fibers. The MOF-5
crystals were stringed by the cotton fibers as a MOF-5 “necklace”
(Figure 2D). In both
cases, the truncated cubic shape of the crystals was formed at 65
°C. This MOF-5 was made of dicarboxylic linkers and metal ions
that together created a three-dimensional cubic unit cell. In general,
the crystal shape is related to its internal structure,44 it is a reflection of the unit cell shape, and
thus the shape of MOF-5 crystals was expected to be cubic. All of
the crystals formed had the same truncated cubic shape.

To examine
how temperature affects the crystal shape, another set
of experiments were performed, in which the substrates were kept in
the mother solution for 3 day at 105 °C. As a substrate in this
set of MOF-5 growth, only cotton bulbs were used because it was proven
that the crystals could be firmly attached to the fibers. The crystal
shape could be controlled by changing the synthesis conditions.45 In this case, an increase of temperature led
to a change of MOF-5 crystal shape. It is evident in Figure 3 that the resulting MOF-5 crystals
have the expected cubic shape. SEM analysis proved once again the
importance of substrate modification with DA solution. The unmodified
cotton bulbs (Figure 3A) were much less covered with MOF-5 crystals than the DA-modified
substrates (Figure 3B–D). The formed PDA film on the surface of fibers provided
more nucleation sites for MOF-5 crystals because of interactions of
catechol groups of DA with metal ions of MOF-5. A better coverage
of substrates with MOF-5 crystals was achieved. Moreover, as a result
of having more nucleation sites on the surface of the fibers, smaller
crystals were formed with a size of less than 100 μm. MOF-5
crystals on the DA-modified fibers were found to be more uniform in
size than those grown on the unmodified cotton fibers, which had a
size larger than 100 μm. Once again, the “necklace”
morphology was confirmed with the crystals wrapping cotton fibers,
as it can be clearly seen from Figure 3D, with the red arrows pointing out to the fibers penetrating
through the crystals.

°C.

morphology (the scale bar is 100 μm).

Attenuated total reflection–FTIR spectra of pristine
cotton,
cotton modified with PDA and MOF-5@cotton substrates are shown in Figure 4. PDA and cellulose
in the structures have similar spectra. The bands between 3300 and
3400 cm–1 can be assigned to not only −OH
group stretching modes but also to −NH from PDA. The presence
of the quinine group in PDA can be confirmed with the peak at 1720
cm–1 that appeared in the case of DA-modified cotton
with and without MOF-5 crystals. Furthermore, the spectrum for DA-modified
cotton showed a broad and weak signal around 1600 cm–1, and it is assigned to −C=C stretching modes.46,47 However, in the case of MOF-5 grown around the fibers, the strong
peaks around 1390 and 1600 cm–1 are assigned to
the existence of organic linker, which is in the case of MOF-5 terephthalic
acid.48

modified in DA solution,
and MOF-5@cotton structure obtained at 105 °C.

XRD was used to confirm the crystal structure of
pristine MOF-5
crystals and MOF-5 crystals grown on DA-modified and unmodified cotton
at 105 °C. Unlike XRD patterns of MOF-5 truncated cubic crystals
grown at 65 °C (Figure S3), Figure 5 shows a typical
diffractogram of MOF-5 crystals as previously reported by Yaghi et
al.38 All of the characteristic peaks were
identified confirming the cubic shape of MOF-5 crystals observed in
SEM analyses in Figure 5, as well as its crystallinity due to sharp diffraction peaks. Furthermore,
the modification of cotton bulbs with DA did not affect the crystal
structure of MOF-5, which could be observed by contrasting XRD patterns
in Figure 5.

of MOF-5 crystals and MOF-5 crystals grown on modified
and unmodified cotton bulbs at 105 °C.

The pore properties of both MOF-5 and MOF-5@cotton samples
were
analyzed using nitrogen physisorption at 77 K. Figure 6 shows adsorption and desorption isotherms
of the pristine MOF-5 and MOF-5@cotton. The measurements showed type
I isotherm for both samples with a characteristic sharp increase at
the low relative pressure (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Even though N2 adsorption slightly
decreased in the case of MOF-5@cotton, the sample kept high porosity.
The specific areas are 658.04 m2/g for MOF-5 crystals and
611.71 m2/g for MOF-5@cotton structure.

MOF crystals have been studied for various environmental
applications.49,50 Combined with cellulose fibers,
those structures would have certain
advantages because of their green nature and low cost. However, there
must be a strong attachment of MOF crystals on the substrate. In this
work, we demonstrated that it is possible to bind MOF-5 crystals and
cellulose fibers. However, how strong MOF-5 crystals were attached
to cellulose fibers could be questioned. We quantitatively determined
their strength by exposing MOF-5@cotton samples to a constant air
blow, 18 L/min, three times for 20 s, or until a constant mass was
reached (Figure 7A).
The mass of the MOF-5@cotton structure was measured before and after
the air blow. The percentage of MOF-5 crystals remaining attached
to the fibers was calculated using the equation given in the experimental
part.

Figure 7 (A) Exposing MOF-5@cotton structure to a constant air flow in order
to determine the stability of fabricated structures and (B) stability
of MOF-5@cotton structures as a function of DA solution concentration.

The fabricated MOF-5@cotton structure
proved to be quite resistant
to the air blow effect, and the “necklace” morphology
increased the stability of the MOF crystals stringed on the fibers. Figure 7B compares the results
for cotton substrates modified and unmodified with two different DA
concentrations. The percentage of MOF-5 crystals remaining attached
to the unmodified cotton substrates was 91.9 ± 1.1%. For the
substrate treated with 2 mg/mL of DA solution, this number was 94.8
± 0.6%, whereas for 5 mg/mL, it was 96 ± 1.1%, which clearly
indicated that DA improved the attachment of MOF-5 to the cotton fibers.

The TGA curves of cotton, MOF-5, and MOF-5@cotton structures are
shown in Figure 8.
A major weight loss in the case of pure cotton occurred between 180
and 430 °C because of decomposition of cellulose as the main
component of cotton. The thermogram for pristine MOF-5 revealed its
typical degradation mechanism with two weight losses. The first weight
loss (5.51%) occurred because of solvent evaporation, whereas the
degradation of MOF started around 400 °C. Finally, for the MOF-5@cotton
sample, the first weight loss could be attributed not only to the
evaporation of solvent (DMF) which was used for the synthesis of MOF-5
but also to the evaporation of adsorbed moisture in cotton fibers.
Every additional weight loss before 430 °C was attributed to
the degradation of cotton fibers, which was consistent with the results
for pure cotton. Decomposition of the framework caused the final weight
loss, and it started after 430 °C.51−53 The amount of char formed
during thermal degradation was used to quantitatively determine the
amount of MOF-5 incorporated. The char yield of pure cellulose at
600 °C was 11.3%, whereas in the case of MOF-5@cotton structures,
the number increased to 35.7%. Thus, the structures had 24.4% MOF-5
by mass.

and pure cotton.

Conclusions
In
summary, a facile method to attach MOF-5 crystals to cellulose-based
fibers and to fabricate stable morphologies is demonstrated. Paper
and cotton fibers have been used in the experiments. In both substrates,
DA was used as a surface modification agent, which promoted the growth
of crystals. The surface was modified by simply immersing substrates
in a DA solution. An important difference between the two substrates
was in the way of crystals growth. Because of the dense structure
of the paper, MOF-5 crystals could grow only on the surface of the
substrate. In contrast, in the case of cotton substrates, the crystals
grew throughout the whole body of a cotton bulb and were firmly attached
to the fibers. MOF-5 crystals could grow around the surface of individual
cellulose fibers, generating a stable “necklace” morphology.
In this way, MOF-5 crystals were firmly attached to the fibers, which
are desired in many applications. Apart from the structure of the
used substrates, surface modification of the substrates with DA played
a major role in the crystal growth. No matter what kind of substrate
was used, all of the experiments showed that after DA modification,
more crystals grew on the surface. The obtained MOF-5@cotton structure
showed excellent stability when they were exposed to air blow as an
external influence because of the strong attachment of the crystals
and fibers.
