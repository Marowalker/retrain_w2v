A novel magnetic
carbon-based solid acid catalyst (C350-Cl) was
synthesized through a simple impregnation–carbonization process
and used for the pretreatment of corncob in an aqueous medium. Under
the optimized pretreatment reaction conditions, the yield of pentose
reached 91.6% with a hemicellulose removal rate of 91.7%, and the
subsequent enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated corncob residue
reached 90.0% at 48 h. C350-Cl is a magnetic enzyme-mimetic solid
acid catalyst, and its catalytic behavior is similar to those of enzymes.
In addition, the catalyst is also an excellent carrier for Fe and
Cl in that the Fe3+ and Cl–can be released
slowly in the pretreatment to assist the hydrolysis of lignocellulose.
Compared with the traditional method with other catalysts, this hydrolysis
process is suitable for the effective and sustainable saccharification
of lignocellulose for producing fermentable sugar.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
overuse of conventional fossil fuel has resulted in problems
such as climate change, air pollution, and energy shortages; therefore,
exploration of alternative renewable resources and the development
of technologies for using such resources have drawn increasing attention
worldwide.1 Lignocellulose biomass is a
renewable and clean resource that can be used as an ideal substitute
for fossil fuel resources to synthesize chemicals and fuels.2−4

The depolymerization of lignocellulose into saccharide and
further
fermentation are important pathways for lignocellulose utilization.
The coupling of pretreatment with enzymatic hydrolysis is an effective
way to degrade the hemicellulose and cellulose in lignocellulose.
However, lignocellulose is complicated and consists of hemicellulose,
cellulose, and lignin,5 and how to reduce
chemically stable lignocellulose through a sustainable and green process
is a research hotspot.6

To date,
many methods have been developed for the pretreatment
of lignocellulose. Among them, pretreatment with homogeneous acid
(including HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4) as catalyst is the most effective saccharification method
and has been widely used in industrial processes.7−9 Lloyd et al.
reported that a xylose yield of up to 32.4% was obtained when sulfuric
acid (0.98%, w/w) was used as the catalyst to pretreat corn stover
at 140 °C for 40 min.10 The subsequent
enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated residue reached 51.8% at
an enzyme loading of 60 FPU/g (here, FPU stands for filter paper units;
one FPU is defined as the amount of cellulase required for producing
1 μmol reducing sugars per minute).10 However, the usage of liquid acids as catalysts results in a series
of problems, such as equipment corrosion and environmental pollution.
To avoid these problems, mild pretreatment methods involving a metal
salt (FeCl3) that can acidify the reaction system were
tested and achieved high hemicellulose removal rates with high enzymatic
digestibility.11,12 Almost all the hemicellulose
in corn stover was removed after pretreatment with 0.1 mol/L FeCl3 solution at 160 °C for 20 min, and a high enzymatic
hydrolysis yield of 91.6% was obtained with 60 FPU/g of cellulose
loaded.13 These reports indicated that
the Cl– released from FeCl3 combines
with H+ to generate HCl under aqueous hydrothermal conditions.
Although this method can efficiently pretreat lignocellulose, removing
the Cl– from the waste is difficult, which limits
the utilization of this process. LHW (liquid hot water) pretreatment,14−16 without the addition of any chemicals, has been considered a green
method for promoting the enzymatic digestibility of lignocellulose.
With an enzyme loading of 20 FPU/g substrate, up to 90% of the glucose
from the sugar bagasse could be recovered by enzymatic hydrolysis
after LHW pretreatment at 180 °C for 30 min.15 However, the pretreatment product is composed of polysaccharides
(e.g., xylo-, arabino-, and galacto-oligosaccharides) with a random
degree of polymerization, which makes subsequent utilization difficult.

Recently, the pretreatment of lignocellulose with a solid acid
(including molecular sieves,17 metal oxides,18 and carbon-based solid acids19−21) has attracted
attention because solid acids have the advantage of being separable
and recyclable after the reaction.22 Among
the catalysts listed above, carbon-based solid acids are economical,
their structures can be controlled, and they are stable under hydrothermal
conditions, making them well applicable for biomass hydrolysis.

Enzymatic hydrolysis is an effective method for converting cellulosic
substrates into monomeric fermentable sugars. Cellulase is a protein
consisting of exo-β-glucanase, endo-β-glucanase, and β-glucosidase
(formed by basic protein groups −NH2, −COOH,
−OH, and −SH), which can effectively hydrolyze the glycosidic
linkages in cellulosic substrates.23,24 Thus, enzyme-mimetic
carbon-based solid acids are effective catalysts for hemicellulose
degradation, and they consist of a binding domain and a catalytic
domain, simulating the synergistic catalytic behaviors of enzymes
for lignocellulose hydrolysis.25 Shuai
et al.26 synthesized a sulfonated chloromethyl
polystyrene resin (CP–SO3H) that contains both a
cellulase binding domain (−CH2Cl) and a catalytic
domain (−SO3H). The −CH2Cl moieties
form strong hydrogen bonds with −OH moieties on the cellulose
chain, and the acidic groups (−SO3H) cleave the
β-1,4-glycosidic linkages (−O−) between the cellulose
units. The activation energy for hydrolyzing crystalline cellulose
catalyzed by a cellulase-mimetic solid acid (83 kJ/mol)26 is lower than that when using sulfuric (170
kJ/mol) or other solid acid catalysts (110 kJ/mol),19 indicating that the cellulase-mimetic sold acid is more
effective for cellulose depolymerization under mild reaction conditions.
For carbon-based solid acid catalysts, carboxyl groups (−COOH)
are typically formed during carbonization of lignocellulose as a precursor.27 The −COOH groups in the catalyst are
acidic catalytic functional groups.28 Therefore,
if a solid acid catalyst containing Cl– and −COOH
moieties can be synthesized, it could suitably enhance the mass transfer
process between the catalyst and lignocellulose, which can promote
the reaction rate.

In this study, the preparation method of
a novel magnetic enzyme-mimetic
carbon-based solid acid catalyst from microcrystalline cellulose and
its application in the pretreatment (hydrolysis) of corncob under
hydrothermal conditions were reported. This catalyst not only showed
high catalytic activity in the hydrolytic pretreatment of corncob
with a significantly enhanced enzymatic digestibility but could also
be easily separated from the mixture by a magnet. Furthermore, the
catalyst could retard the release of chloride ions during the pretreatment
reaction to enhance the hydrolysis of lignocellulose and be reused
multiple times with a slight decrease in catalytic activity for pentose
yield. This two-step hydrolysis, pretreatment with the solid catalyst
combined with enzymatic hydrolysis, provides a sustainable and effective
method for the saccharification of lignocellulose into reducing sugars.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of C350-Cl
and C350
The surface morphologies of C350-Cl and its precursor
(oven-dried
microcrystalline cellulose immersed in FeCl3) are shown
in Figure 1. As shown
in Figure 1a, some
particles were distributed on the smooth surface of the precursor,
and the particles were mainly ferric hydroxide (FeO(OH)), which formed
during hydrothermal coprecipitation and drying.32 By comparing Figure 1a and Figure 1b, there are obvious changes due to the carbonization process; these
mainly include the surface of the microcrystalline cellulose becoming
rough and porous due to the dehydration reaction, and the particles
became micromorphologically clustered due to FeO(OH) being converted
into Fe3O4 during the carbonization process.33

Figure 1 SEM of C350-Cl and its precursor: (a) image of the C350-Cl
precursor
and (b) image of C350-Cl.

The elemental compositions of C350-Cl and its precursor, shown
in Table 1, are CH0.7O0.32Cl0.09Fe0.03 and CH1.72O0.59Cl0.11Fe0.02, respectively.
Comparison of the elemental data shows that Cl and Fe have been successfully
bound to the catalyst. In addition, the decreases in the H and O contents
verified the occurrence of the dehydration reaction.

Table 1 Elemental Compositions of C350-Cl
and Its Precursor
element	C (%)	H (%)	O (%)	Cl (%)	Fe (%)	
precursor	40.95	5.86	32.15	12.27	4.23	
C350-Cl	59.36	3.47	25.01	15.24	6.43	
To illustrate the details, XRD, FT-IR, and XPS were
used to analyze
prepared C350-Cl and C350. The XRD patterns of C350 and C350-Cl exhibited
broad but weak diffraction peaks at 2θ from 15 to 30°,
and this peak can be attributed to amorphous carbon composed of aromatic
carbon sheets in a considerably random orientation,32 as shown in Figure 2a. At the same time, the characteristic peak of Fe3O4 is shown in Figure 2a, and the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 30.1, 35.4,
43.1, 56.9, and 62.5° were attributed to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1),
(4 0 0), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) lattice planes of Fe3O4, respectively,33 which also confirms
the formation of Fe3O4 as a product indicated
by SEM analysis.

Figure 2 (a) Structure and functional group analysis of C350-Cl
and C350XRD
patterns; (b) FT-IR spectra.

The FT-IR spectrum of the catalysts is shown in Figure 2b. The absorption peak at 3386
cm–1 is attributed to the O–H stretching
vibration of −COOH and phenolic −OH groups.27 The adsorption peak at 1702 cm–1 is attributed to C=O in −COOH,19 and the peak at 1610 cm–1 is assigned
to the C=C stretch in the carbon skeleton. The adsorption peak
at 1431 cm–1 was assigned to C–H bonds in
the saturated hydrocarbon, and the peak at 1260 cm–1 was attributed to C–O stretching vibrations of −COOH
and phenol moieties.34 The FT-IR observations
reveal that both C350-Cl and C350 contain −COOH and phenolic
−OH groups.

The XPS spectra of C350-Cl and C350 are shown
in Figure 3. The double
peaks at a binding
energy of 706–710 eV are from Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2, and
the peaks at 530–534, 282–290, and 196–202 eV
are assigned to O, C, and Cl, respectively.35 From the survey results of C350-Cl and C350 shown in Figure 3a, the C350-Cl catalyst possesses
four main elements, Fe, O, C, and Cl, and C350 mainly contains O and
C. This result is consistent with the results shown by XRF and FT-IR.
The deconvolutions of the C 1s and Cl 2p spectra are shown in Figure 3b,c. The C 1s spectrum
of C350-Cl can be deconvoluted into three single peaks (Figure 3b). The binding energy of 284.5
eV for C 1s confirms the presence of C–C bonds (carbon skeleton),
the binding energy at 286 eV is characteristic of C–O (in the
form of −COOH or C–OH), and that at 288 eV is indicative
of C=O bonds (mainly in the form of −COOH).36 The Cl 2p signals can be deconvoluted into two
double peaks, which come from the overlap of chloride signals at 200
and 197 eV and the C–Cl bonds of C350-Cl at 201.5 and 199.5
eV.37

and C350; (b) C 1s spectrum
of C350-Cl; (c) Cl 2p spectrum of C350-Cl.

Based on these characterization results, the properties and differences
of C350-Cl and C350 catalysts could be distinguished, and the carbon
structures were proposed as shown in Figure 4. C350-Cl and C350 are amorphous carbon structures
composed of uniform nanographene sheets bearing −COOH and −OH
groups in a considerably random pattern. In addition, C350-Cl also
consists of C–Cl groups and Fe3O4 magnetic
particles. These groups make it distinct from conventional solid acids
with single functional groups, and the roles of these groups in the
catalytic saccharification of hemicellulose will be discussed later.

the real amounts and distribution of functional groups.

2.2 Pretreatment of Corncob Catalyzed by C350-Cl
To obtain a higher xylose yield, the hydrolysis temperature, hydrolysis
time, ratio of corncob to catalyst, and water content were optimized.
As shown in Figure 5a, the highest xylose and xylan yields of 77.4 and 14.2% were obtained
from the reaction at 150 °C for 2 h. The reaction temperature
was increased from 110 to 190 °C, and the highest yields of pentose
and xylose were obtained at 150 °C. This result can be attributed
to the increase in the reaction temperature promoting the saccharification
of hemicellulose and xylan while also promoting further degradation
of the formed monosaccharide.38 When the
temperature was further increased, no xylan was detected, and the
yield of xylose decreased. Therefore, a reaction temperature of approximately
150 °C was best for these consecutive reactions under these reaction
conditions. At the same time, the increase in the furfural concentration
obtained above 150 °C also confirmed the occurrence of side reactions,
and the subsequent decrease was due to another aldol reaction.39,40

Figure 5 Effects
of the (a) hydrolysis temperature, (b) hydrolysis time,
(c) ratio of catalyst to corncob, and (d) water content on the sugar
yield in corncob pretreatment catalyzed by C350-Cl. In (a)–(d),
only one hydrolysis parameter was varied according to 150 °C,
2 h, 2 g of corncob, 2 g of C350-Cl, and 50 mL of deionized water
as the other parameters.

Figure 5b shows
the effect of the pretreatment reaction time on the reducing sugar
yield. The reactions were performed from 0.5 to 2.5 h at 150 °C
with 2 g of corncob, 2 g of catalyst, and 50 mL of deionized water.
With the reaction time increasing from 0.5 to 2.5 h, the yield of
xylose obviously increased from 61.14 to 77.39%, the yield of xylan
decreased from 27.76 to 14.47%, and the yield of total reducing sugars
decreased at 2 h. This result implies that along with corncob hydrolysis
into xylose, xylose underwent substantial degradation at longer reaction
times due to its concentration. Thus, 2 h was selected as the optimum
reaction time for further research.

Figure 5c shows
the effect of catalyst loading on the yield of reducing sugar. Catalyst
loadings from 1 to 2.5 g were investigated at 150 °C for 2 h
with 2 g of corncob and 50 mL of deionized water. When the catalyst
loading increased from 1 to 1.5 g, the yields of total reducing sugars
were similar, but the yield of xylose was significantly increased.
This result was attributed to the catalyst having more catalytic activity
in the degradation of the saccharide of hemicellulose or the oligomer
rather than the degradation of xylose. When the catalyst loading was
increased from 1.5 to 2 g, the total yield of reducing sugars obviously
increased from 77.2 to 91.6%, which was due to the higher catalyst
loading increasing the number of acid sites in the reaction system.
However, a further increase of the catalyst loading resulted in a
decrease in both the yields of total reducing sugars and xylose for
two main reasons; first, more acid sites are present in the reaction
system, and they can also catalyze the degradation of xylose, and
second, the increase in the amount of solid in the system leads to
a decrease in mass transfer efficiency, which can decrease the generating
rate of hemicellulose and insoluble oligomer saccharification but
also enhance the degrading rate of xylan and xylose.41 Thus, a catalyst loading of 2 g was selected as the optimum
amount for further studies.

Figure 5d shows
the influence of water amount on the yield of total reducing sugars.
Amounts of water from 30 to 90 mL were investigated at 150 °C
for 2 h with 2 g of corncob and 2 g of catalyst. As the amount of
water was increased from 30 to 90 mL, the yield of total reducing
sugars increased from 75.7 to 91.6% (at 50 mL) and then decreased
significantly to 43.9% (at 90 mL). This result was due to the lower
liquid-to-solid ratio hindering mass transfer in the system, and the
higher ones result in a lower concentration of acid sites, which essentially
decreases the amount of catalyst. Therefore, 50 mL of water was selected
as the optimal amount.

Based on the above investigation, the
optimized reaction conditions
for hemicellulose saccharification and total reducing sugar yield
were identified as 2 g of corncob, 2 g of catalyst, and 50 mL of deionized
water at 150 °C for 2 h. In addition, glucose and glucan, the
products of cellulose saccharification, could be obtained in the pretreatment
process of corncob. Since glucose and glucan are not the main products
of the pretreatment, their reaction behaviors are not discussed here.

The catalytic activity of C350-Cl for the pretreatment of corncob
under the optimum reaction conditions was compared with those of other
solid acid catalysts (Table 2). These catalysts can be divided into three types: the first
is Amberlyst-15, a synthetic resin bearing only −SO3H groups; the second is the catalyst bearing −COOH, −OH,
and −SO3H groups; and the third is the catalyst
synthesized in this work bearing −COOH, −OH, and C–Cl
groups. Compared with Fe3O4/C-SO3H,42 the yield of xylose from C350-Cl
is much higher than that with Fe3O4/C-SO3H under mild reaction conditions. Compared with C-SO3H41 and Gp-SO3H-H2O2,43 a similar xylose yield
was achieved in a shorter reaction time. In addition, the catalytic
activity in this work is better than that of Amberlyst-15,43 and a higher xylose yield can be obtained in
a shorter reaction time. These results imply that the enzyme-mimetic
synergistic effect of the bound functional groups plays an important
role in the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose of corncob. The details
of the enzyme-mimetic synergistic effect among the −COOH, −OH,
and C–Cl groups bound to this catalyst will be discussed later.

2.3 Enzymatic Hydrolysis of the Pretreated Corncob
Residue
The component changes of the corncob after the pretreatment
process are shown in Table 3. Through the pretreatment process, the proportions of glucan
in the corncob residue increased from 36.9 to 61.3%, while the proportion
of xylan decreased from 32.2 to 6.3%. Almost all the hemicellulose
and a portion of the lignin in the corncob were removed with removal
rates of 91.7 and 26.3%, respectively. In addition, the retention
rate of cellulose in pretreated corncob was 70.6%, which meets the
aim of the pretreatment process.

Figure 6 shows the
enzymatic hydrolysis of natural and pretreated corncob. The comparison
indicates that the enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated corncob
residue is much higher than that of natural corncob. With an enzyme
loading of 40 FPU/g, the enzymatic digestibility of natural corncob
was 59.3% at 48 h and 64.7% at 72 h, whereas that of the pretreated
corncob residue was 90.0% at 48 h and 94.8% at 72 h. The total sugar
yield from corncob of 86.0% was obtained after pretreatment and enzymatic
hydrolysis of 72 h. The enzymatic digestibility of pretreated corncob
at 48 and 72 h increased by 30.7 and 30.1%, respectively, which indicates
that pretreatment with C350-Cl could effectively enhance the enzymatic
digestibility of corncob.

Figure 6 Enzymatic digestibility of natural and pretreated
corncob. Pretreatment
conditions: 150 °C, 2 h, 2 g of corncob, 2 g of C350-Cl, and
50 mL of deionized water. Enzymatic hydrolysis conditions: 5% substrate
concentration (g/mL) at 50 °C.

The enzymatic digestibility of the residues pretreated with C350-Cl
is comparable to those following other pretreatment methods (i.e.,
other solid acids, liquid hot water, and dilute acid and alkali pretreatment),
as shown in Table 4. The enzymatic digestibility values of corncob44 and sugarcane bagasse45 were
82.4 and 77.9%, respectively, after LHW pretreatment at 180 °C
for 20 min. The enzymatic digestibility of sugarcane bagasse was only
76.6% with the addition of 1.25% HCl during the LHW pretreatment process.46 Higher enzymatic digestibility (98.5%) was obtained
after the addition of pressurized 25% NH3.45 Sugarcane bagasse pretreated with 0.5 M NaOH solution before
LHW pretreatment also showed a higher enzymatic hydrolysis, and an
enzymatic digestibility of 97.5% was obtained after 72 h.47 However, these methods are not only complicated
but also not friendly to the environment. In contrast, pretreatment
with solid acid C350-Cl provided an enzymatic digestibility of 94.8%
after 72 h, which is better than that achieved with LHW pretreatment,
and the developed method also has no concomitant device corrosion
or environmental pollution. Furthermore, the solid acid can be easily
recycled and reused due to its magnetic property.

To explain the enhanced enzymatic
digestibility of corncob after
pretreatment, XRD and SEM were used to analyze the changes in the
natural and pretreated corncob, as shown in Figures S1 and S2. In the pattern of the pretreated corncob residue,
the intensity of the signal at 2θ = 18°, which represents
the amorphous area, is almost the same as that of corncob. However,
the intensity of the diffraction peak at 2θ = 22.5°, which
represents the crystalline part, indicates an obvious change due to
pretreatment. The crystallinity index (CrI) increased from 41.5 to
55.1%, indicating that the amorphous cellulose was maintained during
pretreatment. In addition, this result not only agrees with the component
analysis but also illustrates the reason for the enhanced enzymatic
digestibility.

The surface morphology of the natural corncob
was smooth and dense
(Figure S2a), whereas the structure was
deconstructed after pretreatment with C350-Cl, and the surface became
loose and shattered. The porous structure of the pretreated corncob
is also shown in Figure S2b, and this morphology
indicates that the pretreatment process destroyed the structure and
improved the accessibility of the cellulose to the cellulase.

2.4 Recyclability Performance
Easy separation
from the reaction system for reuse is an important property of a solid
acid catalyst. C350-Cl is a magnetic enzyme-mimetic carbon-based solid
acid catalyst that can be separated from the reaction system by a
magnet after the pretreatment reaction, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Separation of the catalyst
from the reaction mixture with a magnet
(the figure was taken by a co-author of this manuscript (G.L.)).

After the recovery of C350-Cl, it was reused in
the pretreatment
of corncob as shown in Figure 8a. After five cycles of reuse, the total yield of xylose and
xylan decreased slightly from 91.6 to 80.2%, and the total yield of
pentose was steady after the third cycle of reuse. In contrast, the
yield of xylose decreased significantly and then became steady. Analysis
of the pretreated hydrolysate indicated that the concentrations of
Fe3+ and Cl– were high in the first usage
(440.5 and 1077.6 mg/L, respectively, corresponding to 17% of the
ferric iron and chloride initially bound to C350-Cl) of the catalytic
reaction and became stable after the second cycle (approximately 20
mg/L ferric iron and 200 mg/L chloride (Table S1), corresponding to 0.8% of the ferric iron and 3.3% of the
chloride initially bound to C350-Cl). There are two main reasons for
the detected Fe3+ and Cl–. First, a portion
of the FeCl3 was not converted into Fe3O4 during the carbonization process but became bound to the
catalyst as FeCl3 or in other forms. Therefore, the attached
FeCl3 was dissolved into the hydrolysate during the first
pretreatment process. The second reason was the dissolution of the
formed Fe3O4 in the acidic system.

2 g of C350-Cl, 2 g of corncob, and 50 mL of deionized water. N.C.

The aim of pretreatment of corncob is to deconstruct
its structure
and enhance the enzymatic digestibility of pretreated residue. The
enzymatic hydrolysis of the corncob residue pretreated with the recycle
catalyst was carried out, and its enzymatic digestibility is shown
in Figure 8b. Through
the comparison of Figure 8a and Figure 8b, the enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated residue indicated
a similar trend to the yield of sugar. The decrease of catalytic activity
of C350-Cl results in the decrease in the yield of xylose during the
pretreatment process and also in a decrease of the enzymatic digestibility
of the residue. Fortunately, although the enzymatic digestibility
of the corncob residue pretreated with the recycled catalyst declined,
the enzymatic digestibility was stable and much higher than that of
natural corncob.

To illustrate the key catalytic factors in
the reaction, some comparative
experiments with different additives related to components of the
catalyst or the reaction system (according to the tested values of
each component on the catalyst or in the hydrolysate) were carried
out using the reaction conditions shown in Figure 9. FeCl3 is capable of disrupting
the ether and ester linkages of hemicellulose.13 To confirm the influence of FeCl3, 0.022 g of
FeCl3 in 50 mL of deionized water (the same Fe3+concentration as that in the hydrolysate catalyzed by fresh C350-Cl)
was used as a control experiment for FeCl3 (Figure 9). FeCl3 provided
16.37% xylose and 81.36% pentose yields, which are both lower than
those obtained with C350-Cl (77.39% xylose and 91.56% pentose, Figure 9). This means that
although Fe3+ and Cl– are released after
the first use of C350-Cl, this concentration is not high enough to
catalyze the degradation of corncob xylan into xylose.11 The lowest yield of pentose (55.97%) was obtained
from the hydrothermal pretreatment of corncob (as the No cat result).
The yields of pentose increased slightly when C350 and Fe3O4 were added as the catalysts, and the catalytic activity
of C350 (62.38% yield of pentose) was higher than that of Fe3O4 (60.23% yield of pentose). The catalytic activity of
Fe3O4 might be due to the ionized H+ in the hydrothermal system causing partial dissolution of Fe3O4,48 and Fe3+ can catalyze the hydrolysis of corncob hemicellulose.49 Two functional groups (−OH and −COOH)
are bound to the catalyst based on the characterization of C350. Carboxyl
(−COOH) moieties are able to hydrolyze the β-1,4-glycosidic
bonds of cellulose,19 which may be the
catalytic pathway of C350 in the hydrolysis of corncob, allowing it
to achieve a higher yield of pentose than that using liquid hot water
(62.38% yield of pentose with C350 versus 55.97% with no catalyst).

Figure 9 Experiments
with different catalysts at 150 °C for 120 min.
The reaction conditions are as follows: FeCl3, 0.022 g
of FeCl3, 2 g of corncob, 50 mL of water; C350, 2 g of
C350, 2 g of corncob, 50 mL of water; No cat, 2 g of corncob with
no catalyst (liquid hot water), 50 mL of water; Fe3O4, 0.5 g of Fe3O4, 2 g of corncob, 50
mL of water.

Since the acidity of the solid
acid is an important factor that
affects corncob hydrolysis,33 the total
populations of acid sites in the first, second, and fifth cycles of
C350-Cl were detected and are shown in Table S2. The result shows that the trend in the amount of total acid has
no correlation with the trend in the xylose yield. Thus, the acidity
of C350-Cl is not the main reason for the higher xylose yield. In
conclusion, all the evidence indicates that the unique C–Cl
moieties of C350-Cl are the key to generating the xylose product.

Based on the results of these reuse and comparison experiments,
a possible mechanism of corncob hydrolysis catalyzed by C350-Cl was
proposed, as shown in Figure 10. The hydrolysis pretreatment of corncob catalyzed by C350-Cl
in an aqueous medium is a reaction on the surface of reactants, and
the mass transfer between the corncob and catalyst is the main factor
controlling the reaction. Cl, O, and H are the main components of
the corncob and the catalyst, and positively charged H ions can interact
with the negatively charged O and Cl ions. Therefore, hydrogen bonds
formed between the −OH and −O– groups in the
corncob and C–Cl groups in the catalyst,26,50 similar to the binding domain of enzymes, enhancing the mass transfer
between the corncob and the catalyst. Then, the acidic functional
groups (−OH and −COOH) cleave the glycosidic linkages24 of hemicellulose or xylan to gradually produce
xylose, similar to the catalytic domain of enzymes. When Cl is reduced
due to the breakage of the C–Cl bonds during the recycling
of the catalyst, the hydrogen bonds between the hemicellulose chains
and the catalyst become weaker, resulting in a decrease in the proportion
of xylose in the obtained pentose. The catalytic behavior of this
catalyst is similar to the cellulase-mimetic solid acid CP-SO3H synthesized by Shuai et al.,26 which also contained both a binding domain and a catalytic domain.

Figure 10 Schematic
of the catalytic mechanism between C350-Cl and lignocellulose
(it does not represent the real amount and distribution of functional
groups).

In conclusion, the existence of
C–Cl on the catalyst can
enhance the mass transfer during the pretreatment process because
of the formed hydrogen bond between lignocellulose and the catalyst,
and they have a synergistic effect on the saccharification of lignocellulose.
With the release of Fe3+ and Cl–, the
selectivity for xylose decreased dramatically, but the yield of pentose
became stable after the second time usage. In the future research
work, we must focus on how to make the C–Cl bond and Fe3O4 particles stable on loading onto the catalyst,
which can maintain the high catalytic activity and selectivity of
the catalyst.

3 Conclusions
A novel
magnetic enzyme-mimetic solid acid catalyst (C350-Cl) was
synthesized without the traditional sulfonation process. The catalyst
showed high catalytic activity for the pretreatment of corncob, with
a xylose yield of 77.4% and a xylan yield of 14.2% under the optimum
reaction conditions (150 °C, 2 h, 2 g of corncob, 2 g of catalyst,
and 50 mL of deionized water), and the catalyst could easily be separated
from the residue by an external magnet. Because of the high removal
rate of hemicellulose in corncob (up to 91.7%), the accessibility
of the cellulose to the enzyme was obviously enhanced, and the enzymatic
digestibility of the pretreated corncob residue was much higher than
that of natural corncob. The synergistic effect between the C–Cl
and −COOH moieties of the catalyst was found. During the pretreatment
of corncob with C350-Cl, the C–Cl groups form hydrogen bonds
with the hemicellulose in the corncob, and these interactions promote
the accessibility between the catalyst and substrate, similar to what
occurs in the binding domain of enzymes; the acidic group (−COOH)
breaks the glycosidic linkages in hemicellulose and xylan to gradually
degrade them into xylose. This work not only suggests the potential
of a lignocellulose biorefinery process but also indicates a new platform
for the design of carbon-based solid acid catalysts for the pretreatment
of lignocellulose.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Corncob (40–60 mesh)
was obtained from a farm in Shandong province, China, and dried at
80 °C to a constant weight, and the material contained 36.9%
cellulose, 32.2% lignocellulose, and 14.3% lignin according to the
NREL analysis method.29 Iron (III) chloride
(CP) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). Microcrystalline cellulose (GR) and anhydrous ferric chloride
(AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). Cellulase (190 FPU/g) was purchased from Imperial Jade Bio-Technology
Co., Ltd. (Ningxia, China).

4.2 Catalyst Preparation
Microcrystalline
cellulose (10 g) was added into FeCl3 solution (1000 mL)
with a concentration of 10 mmol/L and stirred (500 rpm) at room temperature
for 5 h. Then, the mixture was heated to evaporate the water and dried
at 105 °C to a constant weight. The obtained black solid was
carbonized in a tube furnace with nitrogen (50 mL/min) protection
at 350 °C (heating rate: 3 °C/min) and kept at the temperature
for 1 h. The carbonized black solid was then ground into a powder
(<100 mesh) and washed with ethanol and hot water (> 80 °C)
until no Fe3+ and Cl– were detected upon
treatment with KSCN and AgNO3 solutions. Finally, the catalyst
was dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 °C and is denoted
C350-Cl. For comparison, a carbon catalyst (denoted C350) was synthesized
following the same procedure without the addition of FeCl3.

4.3 Characterization of the Catalyst, Corncob,
and Pretreated Residues
The functional groups on the catalysts
were detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (TENSOR27
from Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) from 400 to 4000 cm–1 using the standard KBr pellet method. The micromorphologies of the
catalysts were characterized by cold field scanning electron microscopy
(Cryo-SEM, S-4800 from Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The crystal structures
of C350-Cl and C350 were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using
an X’Pert Pro MPD system (PANalyticAlmele, the Netherlands).
The operating conditions were 40 kV and 40 mA using a Cu Kα
radiation source, and the scanning angle (2θ) was from 5 to
80° with a scanning rate of 4°/min. The elemental composition
of the catalyst was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
with an ESCALAB 250Xi system (Thermo, Waltham, USA). The contents
of C, O, and H in the catalysts were detected using a Vario EL Cube
elemental analysis system (Elementar, Frankfurt, Germany), and the
contents of Fe and Cl in the catalysts were detected by X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry (XRF) with an AXIOSmAX-PETRO system (PANalytical B.V.
manufacturer, the Netherlands).

The acid amount of catalyst
was detected by acid–base titration.30 The catalyst (0.2 g) and 20 mL of 0.05 mol/L NaOH were mixed in
a 50 mL centrifuge tube and treated with an ultrasonic apparatus for
1 h. Then, 15 mL of the supernatant of the centrifuged mixture was
titrated with 0.05 mol/L HCl using methyl orange solution as an indicator.

XRD and SEM analyses of natural and pretreated corncob were also
carried out using the same instruments under the same conditions mentioned
above.

4.4 Two-Step Corncob Hydrolysis
The corncob
pretreatment (hydrolysis) was conducted in a 100 mL autoclave with
a stirring apparatus (CJF-0.1, Dalian Tongda Reactor Factory, China).
The catalyst (1–2.5 g), corncob (2 g), and deionized water
(30–90 mL) were added into the reactor and mixed at a constant
stirring rate of 500 rpm. The reactor temperature was detected using
a thermocouple and maintained from 110 to 190 °C. The reaction
time was from 30 to 150 min. After the reaction, the catalyst was
separated from the reaction medium with an external magnet for reuse,
and the hydrolysate was collected for further analysis. The pretreated
residue was separated from the reactant, washed, and dried at 50 °C
to a constant weight for enzymatic hydrolysis.

Enzymatic hydrolysis
was as follows: 1 g of pretreated corncob residue (under the optimum
reaction conditions) was hydrolyzed at 50 °C for 12–72
h in a 10 mL centrifuge tube with a shaking speed of 150 rpm. The
concentration of substrate was 5% (w/v) relative to cellulose, and
the cellulase loading was 40 FPU/g of dried residue. The hydrolysate
of the enzymatic hydrolysis was collected for analysis.

4.5 Analytical Procedures and Calculation
The reducing
sugars and byproducts (furfural, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural,
acetic acid, formic acid, and d-glucuronic acid) in the hydrolysate
were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters
2695, Milford, USA) with a Shodex sugar SH-1011 chromatographic column
at a column temperature of 50 °C. The mobile phase was 5 mmol/L
H2SO4, and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The
sugar oligomers were treated and measured according to the method
in a previous report.15

The concentrations
of Fe3+ and Cl– in the hydrolysate were
determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (OPTIMA
8000, Perkin Elmer, USA) and three-channel ion chromatography (Model
883, Metrohm, Switzerland), respectively.

The yields of monomeric
and oligomeric sugars from the pretreatment
process were calculated using eqs 1and 2: 1   2  where Nmono is the mole of the corresponding sugar
in the pretreated
hydrolysate, Noligo and Ntotal are the moles of the corresponding oligomer and
total reducing sugars in the pretreated hydrolysate, respectively,
and M is the mole of the corresponding sugar in the
natural corncob.

The enzymatic digestibility of the natural
and pretreated corncob
is defined as 3  where n is
the mole number of glucose in the enzymatic hydrolysate and m is the mole number of glucose in the natural or pretreated
corncob.

The total yield of sugar from the pretreatment of the
corncob and
subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated corncob residue
is defined by eq 4. 4  where a and b are the mass qualities of xylose and glucose obtained
in the pretreatment of corncob, respectively, c and d are the mass qualities of xylose and glucose obtained
in the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated corncob residue, respectively,
and e and f are the mass qualities
of hemicellulose and cellulose in corncob.

The crystallinity
indices of natural and pretreated corncob (CrI)31 are defined by eq 5. 5  where I2θ = 22° is the intensity of the (002)
diffraction plane at 2θ = 22° in the XRD pattern and I2θ = 18° is the intensity
of the baseline at 2θ = 18° in the XRD pattern.

The
removal rates of hemicellulose and lignin in corncob are defined
by eqs 6 and 7, respectively. 6   7  where j is
the mass quality of lignin of corncob and g and h are the mass qualities of cellulose and lignin in pretreatment
corncob, respectively.
