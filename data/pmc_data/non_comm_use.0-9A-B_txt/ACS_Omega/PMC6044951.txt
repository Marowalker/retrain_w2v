Cellulose is the
major component of the plant cell wall
and composed of β-linked glucose units. Use of cellulose is
greatly impacted by its physical properties, which are dominated by
the number of individual cellulose strand within each fiber and the
average length of each strand. Our work described herein provides
a complete mechanism for cellulose synthase accounting for its processivity
and mechanism of initiation. Using ionic liquids and gel permeation
chromatography, we obtain kinetic constants for initiation, elongation,
and termination (release of the cellulose strand from the enzyme)
for two bacterial cellulose synthases (Gluconacetobacter
hansenii and Rhodobacter sphaeroides). Our results show that initiation of synthesis is primer-independent.
After initiation, the enzyme undergoes multiple cycles of elongation
until the strand is released. The rate of elongation is much faster
than that of steady-state turnover. Elongation requires cyclic addition
of glucose (from uridine diphosphate-glucose) and then strand translocation
by one glucose unit. Translocations greater than one glucose unit
result in termination requiring reinitiation. The rate of the strand
release, relative to the rate of elongation, determines the processivity
of the enzyme. This mechanism and the measured rate constants were
supported by kinetic simulation. With the experimentally determined
rate constants, we are able to simulate steady-state kinetics and
mimic the size distribution of the product. Thus, our results provide
for the first time a mechanism for cellulose synthase that accounts
for initiation, elongation, and termination.

==== Body
Introduction
Cellulose is a polymer
of β-1,4 linkage glucose (Glc) units.
It is the major component of plant cell walls1 and thus the most abundant renewable polymer on earth.2,3 Cellulose strands can vary from hundreds to thousands of glucose
units in length.4−8 Because of the extensive hydrogen bonding interactions of individual
strands, cellulose exists as microfibrils making it an excellent structural
component for the plant cell wall.1 A key
property of cellulose is the degree of polymerization (DOP). Higher
DOP values are favorable for use of cellulose as fabric or paper,
whereas lower DOPs are favorable for digestibility (bioethanol).6 DOP measurements can be made through linkage
analysis (number of glucose units per nonreducing end), viscosity
measurement,5 or by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC),9 once the individual strands have
been separated and solubilized.

The DOPs of cellulose of different
sources vary.4−8 Although not proven, it is thought to be an intrinsic
property of an enzyme’s processivity, which is defined as average
number of glucose units added to the growing polymer before the strand
is released (termination). Cellulose is made by both plants and microbes.
The source of each cellulose chain is the enzyme, cellulose synthase.
The plant enzyme has eluded purification, however, two bacterial enzymes, Gluconacetobacter hansenii(10,11) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides,12 have been purified to homogeneity. The most
extensively studied bacterial system is of G. hansenii. The first crystal structure was obtained with the enzyme from R. sphaeroides.12−15 To date, no studies have examined
the DOP of enzyme-synthesized cellulose or the kinetics of the process.
Synthesis of any polymer entails initiation, elongation, and termination
(strand release).

In the present study, we perform kinetic and
chemical analyses
of cellulose synthesized by two purified bacterial enzymes, AcsA-AcsB
from G. hansenii and BcsA-BcsB from R. sphaeroides. Ionic liquids are used to solubilize
the newly synthesized cellulose, which enables analysis by GPC and
multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS). Using uridine diphosphate
(UDP)-[14C]-glucose as the substrate, we are then able
to determine the amount of cellulose synthesized at each DOP size
range. From these studies, we provide a kinetic account for processivity.
With the mechanism and the measured rate constants, we are able to
simulate both steady-state kinetics and processivity with Kinsim.16

Results
GPC Analysis of Cellulose
Bacterial cellulose
from G. hansenii has been
characterized to be more crystalline than plant cellulose.17−19 Using GPC and nitrated cellulose, the average DOP of the cellulose
isolated from live cultures was measured to be 11 000–16 800.20 However, there are only limited studies on in
vitro-synthesized cellulose. The DOP of cellulose synthesized from
a purified cellulose synthase BcsA-BcsB from R. sphaeroides had a measured DOP of 200–300.12 This average, however, provides no details on the size distribution.
To determine this size distribution, the enzymatically generated cellulose
was carbanilated and then solubilized for analysis by GPC. Figure 1 shows the GPC profiles
for cellulose synthesized from the two purified bacterial enzymes
(G. hensenii and R.
sphaeroides), Avicel, and cotton cellulose. Detection
of the cellulose was via multiangle light scattering (MALLS), which
provides information on the cellulose size. These results show that
the cotton cellulose is largest with a peak DOP of 7800 and a maximum
DOP of approximately 20 000 and the Avicel smallest with a
peak DOP of 170. The bacterial cellulose size distribution is in between
cotton and Avicel; cellulose synthesized by AcsA-AcsB is larger at
a peak DOP of 2900 than that from BcsA-BcsB, which has a peak DOP
of 1600.

Figure 1 GPC elution profiles of cellulose tricarbanilates. Cellulose samples
(as labeled in the figure) were carbanilated, as described in Materials and Methods. For cellulose synthesized
from BcsA-BcsB or AcsA-AcsB, 0.5 μM enzyme with 5 mM UDP-Glc
in a reaction volume of 1.0 mL was used, as described in Materials and Methods. Reactions were allowed to
proceed for 12 h. A KD-806M column was used with tetrahydrofuran as
the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1.
The figure shows the molecular weight distribution, converted to DOP
on the right axis, above the associated refractive index detection
signal.

Initiation: Reducing End
Analysis
Cellulose synthase
is a processive glycosyl transferase, where synthesis occurs at the
nonreducing end with the 4-carbon hydroxyl attacking the anomeric
carbon of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc). Primer requirements are difficult
to assess because as-purified heterologously expressed R. sphaeroides cellulose synthase already contains
a cellulose chain in the exit channel of the enzyme.13 Thus, to examine whether initiation is dependent upon a
primer, we utilized UDP-[14C]-Glc. If UDP-Glc is able to
initiate primer-independent synthesis, then the reducing end should
be 14C-labeled in UDP-[14C]-Glc-containing incubations.
To examine this possibility, cellulose from such incubations with
AcsA-AcsB or BcsA-BcsB was covalently modified at the reducing end
with the fluorescent modifying agent 2-aminobenzamide (2AB).21 The 2AB-modified cellulose was then hydrolyzed
with cellulases and β-glucosidase producing free glucose and
2AB-labeled glucose. The 2AB-modified cellulose is easily separated
from free glucose by reversed-phase chromatography. An internal standard
of nonradioactive 2AB-glucose was added to the sample and the sample
was separated by C-18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). 2AB-glucose is detected by its fluorescence. Glucose eluted
as a major radioactive peak at ∼2.5 mL (Figure 2A,B). Another radioactive peak eluted at
∼13 mL, which co-elutes with the 2AB-glucose standard. The
second fluorescent peak in Figure 2 is unreacted 2AB. These results, with both enzymes
showing 14C-glucose at the reducing end, are consistent
with primer-independent synthesis.

Figure 2 Chemical analysis of reducing ends generated
by AcsA-AcsB (A) or
BcsA-BcsB (B) and detection of glucose from BcsA-BcsB incubation (C).
Cellulose was synthesized by either AcsA-AcsB (A) or BcsA-BcsB (B).
Reaction mixtures and modification of the reducing end by 2AB and
subsequent chromatography is described in Materials
and Methods. Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected
and quantified by scintillation spectroscopy. Nonradioactive 2AB-modified
glucose was added to the reaction mixture. Note the split axis in
the figure. (C) BcsA-BcsB-dependent generation of glucose from UDP-Glc
as measured by glucose oxidase. Incubations contained 3 μM BcsA-BcsB
and 5 mM UDP-Glc in a total volume of 0.3 mL as described in Materials and Methods with (●) or without
(○) 10 μM cyclic-di-GMP. Aliquots were removed at specified
times and glucose content measured by glucose oxidase.

We also investigated whether formation of 14C-labeled
reducing ends was derived from contaminating cellulase activity; however,
this possibility was eliminated. Incubation of presynthesized cellulose
with purified enzyme caused no change in the DOP (not shown).

Initiation:
UDP-Glc Hydrolase Activity
A possible primer-independent
mechanism involves UDP-Glc hydrolysis, yielding glucose, which then
can enter the channel as the new reducing end. Indeed, free glucose
was detected using glucose oxidase from UDP-Glc-containing incubations
with BcsA-BcsB (Figure 2C). Nucleotide-sugar hydrolysis is a known activity of glycosyl transferases.22,23

Elongation: GPC DOP Analysis
Elongation involves multiple
rounds of glucose addition from UDP-Glc. Little is known on the basis
of how plants or microbes synthesize cellulose of different DOPs.
Previously, DOP determinations of in vitro-synthesized
cellulose by BcsA-BcsB yielded a numerical average of 200–30012 and no information of size distribution. To
determine the distribution, we used UDP-14C-Glc to label
the cellulose, then solubilized the cellulose with dimethylacetamide
containing 8% lithium chloride,24,25 and analyzed by GPC.
MALLS and a differential refractive index detector9 were used to determine the DOP of the cellulose. BcsA-BcsB-synthesized
cellulose (Figure 3A) showed a progressive increase in strand length up to 30 min, where
the strand length reached a maximum of ∼11 700 (DOP
at the peak is ∼1500). From 30 min to 4 h, the maximum cellulose
size did not increase beyond DOP of ∼11 700. Notably,
throughout the time course, the amount of smaller strands continued
to increase. The same trend (increase in size to a maximum) was observed
with AcsA-AcsB incubations except that the maximum DOP is larger at
∼23 100 (Figure 3B). The DOP at the peak is ∼3000. Thus, both enzymes
exhibit an intrinsic processivity limit (Figure 3A,B).

Figure 3 GPC elution profile of cellulose from
BcsA-BcsB (A) and AcsA-AcsB
(B). Aliquots were removed from enzymatic reaction mixtures at times
as specified in the figures. Cellulose was synthesized from 0.5 nmol
BcsA-BcsB or AcsA-AcsB with 5 mM UDP-14C-Glc in a reaction
volume of 1.0 mL, as described in Materials and Methods. The cellulose was dissolved in dimethylacetamide containing 8%
LiCl (w/v), as described in Materials and Methods. Fractions (0.5 mL) were collected and quantified by scintillation
spectroscopy. The column was calibrated by nonradioactive cellulose
samples and their corresponding MALLS signals (shown as filled circles
above elution profiles) with the DOP on the right axis. The inset
in each graph plots the total cellulose from each sample vs time.
(C) For reducing end quantification by bicinchoninic assay (●),
cellulose was synthesized from 2 μM enzyme with 5 mM UDP-Glc
in a reaction volume of 1.0 mL for the indicated time points. The
cellulose was collected and the reducing ends were analyzed by bicinchoninic
assay, as described in Materials and Methods. For reducing end quantification by GPC analysis (○), moles
of glucose eluting from GPC were divided by the DOP (molecular weight)
of the eluting cellulose in (A). Reducing ends are expressed as moles
per mole of enzyme.

The elution profiles
also provided data for rate measurements.
Total glucose incorporated versus time is plotted in Figure 3 (insets). The rate of cellulose
synthesis can be calculated from the slopes of the lines in the insets
yielding 1.4 s–1 for AcsA-AcsB and 0.37 s–1 for BcsA-BcsB (Figure 3, insets). These values, which were determined under saturating conditions
for UDP-Glc are close to the kcat values
of 1.7 ± 0.36 s–1 (AcsA-AcsB) (Figure 4A)11 and 0.43 ± 0.17 s–1 (BcsA-BcsB) (Figure 4B) determined by
the Michaelis–Menten equation.

Figure 4 Steady-state kinetic analysis (●)
and kinetic simulation
(○) for AcsA-AcsB (A) and BcsA-BcsB (B). The rate of cellulose
synthesis was measured in triplicate and shown with mean and standard
deviation. Rates were measured by the enzyme-coupled assay as described
in Materials and Methods and plotted as a
function of UDP-Glc concentration. The measured rates are shown as
filled circles. Using the experimentally determined kinetic constants
given in Table 1, the
steady-state rates were simulated by the Tenua software, as described
in Materials and Methods and shown as open
circles. The line shown in each plot is a curve fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation. The fit for AcsA-AcsB yields a kcat of 1.7 ± 0.36 s–1 and a Km of 0.27 ± 0.02 mM. For BcsA-BcsB, the fit yields
a kcat of 0.43 ± 0.17 s–1 and a Km of 0.34 ± 0.07 mM.

Elongation: Rate of Elongation
The elution profiles
(Figure 3) show that
at the 2 min time point, the highest DOP (size of cellulose at the
front of the elution profile) is ∼10 000 for AcsA-AcsB
and ∼1500 for BcsA-BcsB. The rate of elongation can be calculated
by dividing this DOP by the time (2 min), which yields a rate of glucose
incorporation of 83 s–1 for AcsA-AcsB and 13 s–1 for BcsA-BcsB. This represents the rate at which
glucose is being incorporated into an actively elongating cellulose
chain. Its measurement must be taken during early time points of the
incubation such that a population of the enzymes have yet to reach
their processivity limit. We then measured the elongation rate in
this way at various UDP-Glc concentrations. Saturation kinetics was
observed for both enzymes (Figures S1A,B) with a maximum elongation rate (kcat) of 12 s–1 and a kcat/Km of 2.0 × 104 M–1 s–1 for BcsA-BcsB. For AcsA-AcsB,
a kcat of 67 s–1 and a kcat/Km of 5.0
× 105 M–1 s–1 were
determined (Table 1).

b The experimental value is calculated
from the slope of the Michaelis–Menten plot, as shown in Figure S1. The reaction of E in the unprimed
form and in the primed form both contribute to this rate constant
(kcat/Km)
and thus is consistent with this value being higher than the simulated
value.

c The value for k4 for translocation is modeled to be not the
rate-limiting
step (see Discussion) and thus is provided
a higher estimated value.

Termination:
Strand Release
Strand release from the
enzyme results in chain termination. The elution profiles, in addition
to yielding information on steady-state kinetics (Figure 3, insets) and elongation (Figure 3) rates, also provide
kinetic information on strand release. Each fraction eluting from
the GPC column is not only characterized by its DOP as determined
by elution time and MALLS but by its cellulose quantity, as determined
by 14C scintillation spectrometry. Dividing the amount
of glucose by the DOP yields the amount of reducing ends. Thus, reducing
end content of each time point can be quantified and thus the rate
of strand release can be calculated. To assess the accuracy of this
method, we also quantified reducing ends with bicinchoninic acid.26Figure 3C shows the time course of reducing ends released, as determined
by both methods. Both methods yielded similar results. We then measured
the rate of strand release as a function of varying UDP-Glc concentrations
(Figure S2). The plot yields a Vmax (kcat) and the
first-order rate constant of 1.2 × 10–3 s–1 for BcsA-BcsB and 3.1 × 10–4 s–1 for AcsA-AcsB.

Minimal Mechanism and Kinetic
Simulation
A proposed
mechanism for initiation, elongation, and termination is shown in Figure 5. The mechanism includes
a fast elongation cycle and a slow initiation process. The right cycle
depicts elongation, the processive addition of glucose. The left cycle
involves termination (strand release) and initiation. Initiation involves
UDP-Glc binding to E (k1) followed by
hydrolysis yielding glucose and UDP (k2). This is followed by entry of the free glucose from the UDP-Glc
binding site into the acceptor site located in the exit channel (k4). The 4-hydroxyl of this new glucose is then
poised to react with the next UDP-Glc, which binds at the UDP-Glc
binding site (k5). The new glycosidic
bond is formed upon attack of the 4-hydroxyl of the “acceptor”
glucose with the UDP-Glc (k6). This rate
constant includes the steps of both glycosidic bond formation as well
as UDP release. For elongation to continue, the newly added glucose
must translocate one glucose unit into the channel (k4). Structural studies by Morgan et al.14 indicate that translocation occurs concurrently with the
movement of the finger helix motif, which contains the catalytic base.
The authors contend that this shift may be facilitated either with
the binding of UDP-Glc or spontaneously. Our mechanism supports the
latter. Alternatively, translocation can proceed further than one
glucose unit (k3 and the left cycle shown
in Figure 5A), forming
free enzyme (E) thereby effectively terminating elongation and requiring
reinitiation (Figures 5A and 4B).

Figure 5 Proposed mechanism for cellulose synthase
and simulation of DOP.
(A) Elongation starts with the cellulose chain properly positioned
in the channel (E*-Cx) for nucleophile attack of UDP-Glc by the nonreducing
end. UDP-Glc binds to E*-Cx (k5) to form
the Michaelis complex. The attack of the 4-hydroxyl with the UDP-Glc
forms the new glycosidic bond and E-Cx (k6). The newly added glucose at the UDP-Glc binding site then must
translocate into the channel by one glucose unit forming E*-Cx (k4), which continues the cyclic process of elongation.
Alternatively, translocation can proceed by more than one glucose
unit resulting in strand release (k3)
or termination forming free enzyme (E). The free enzyme (E) can still
have a cellulose chain attached; however, it is not within close proximity
to react with the incoming UDP-Glc. Initiation involves binding of
UDP-Glc to E (k1). Hydrolysis of UDP-Glc
yields glucose (k2). This intermediate
is similar to the intermediate formed during elongation where the
newly added glucose must translocate from the UDP-Glc binding site
into the channel (k4). (B) A more detailed
scheme. After addition of one glucose, the cellulose chain undergoes
one translocation to form E*-Cx. Alternatively, the cellulose chain
of E-Cx can undergo translocation greater than one glucose unit resulting
in termination (k3). (C, D) Simulated
elution profiles based on the mechanism shown in (A) and (B). Because
Tenua can only accommodate 100 steps, the rate constants were multiplied
by 100 for the purpose of illustrating the importance of the k4 to k3 ratio in
determining the processivity of the enzyme. (C) shows that increasing k4 results in increased DOP. (D) shows that increasing k3 results in decreased DOP. The Tenua input
in regard to the mechanism and the rate constants used for the simulations
are provided in Figures S4 and S5 and Table 1.

With the mechanism shown in Figure 5 and measured rate constants (Table 1), kinetic simulations were
performed. Tenua,27 a modified version
of Kinsim,16 was used. Kinsim can only
incorporate 10 steps, whereas
Tenua has been modified to accommodate 100 steps. Even with this increase
in steps, it cannot fully simulate elongation because it involves
thousands of steps (see Figures S3 and S4 for the mechanistic details of such a simulation). For steady-state
kinetics, velocity was measured (and simulated) as the rate of glucose
incorporation in cellulose. We reasoned that the experimentally determined
rate constants for strand release (k3, Figure S2), the second-order rate constant between
UDP-Glc and enzyme for elongation (k5, Figure S1), and the rate of elongation (k6, Figure S1), should
be relatively accurate (Table 1). In contrast, measurements involving initiation (k1 and k2) would
not be accurate. We reasoned that they would be lower estimates because
it is not possible to measure the glucose incorporation rates from
just initiation without the large amplification from elongation. Thus,
the simulation would potentially provide more accurate estimates of
the rate constants. In addition, the rate of translocation (k4) has been postulated to be not the rate-determining
step on the basis of simulations by Knott et al.,28 thus we have made this rate to be greater than k6. Holding k3, k5, and k6 to be
equal to the measured rates, k1 and k2 were varied such that the steady-state rates
were simulated. Figure 4 shows both actual rate data and the simulation using the values
given in Table 1. In
accord with the caveats mentioned above, the simulated rate constants
for k1 are much lower than the experimentally
determined value.

Although steady-state kinetics was simulated,
strand length or
DOP could not be simulated due to the limitation of Tenua accommodating
only 100 steps. We, thus, set up a mock simulation to determine whether
the mechanism and rate constants can account for processivity. We
increased rate constants (Table 1) such that Tenua would provide data on strand length.
The simulation aimed at determining whether it was possible to simulate
the size distribution of the cellulose (Figure 5C,D). The effect of increasing k3 decreases the DOP (Figure 5C), whereas increasing k4 increases the DOP (Figure 5D). Thus, the simulation shows that processivity
of a cellulose synthase is directly influenced by the relative ratio
of translocation by one glucose unit (k4) (which results in elongation) or by translocation by greater than
one glucose unit (k3, strand release,
termination).

Discussion
Because of the insolubility
of the product cellulose, kinetic characterization
of cellulose synthases has been limited to steady-state kinetic studies
where only the rate of product formation is measured.12 No studies have probed the mechanism of initiation, elongation,
or termination. The ability to solubilize the cellulose product by
ionic liquids, resolve them by GPC, and analyze by MALLS, has allowed
for the first time these parameters to be determined. This size distribution
or length of each strand is most often expressed as DOP. DOP values
are often determined from reducing end analysis26 or by viscosity measurements.5 Although GPC methods are available, which can provide such information,4,29,30 to date, no studies have been
performed on cellulose synthase, until now. Our study characterized
all three phases of cellulose synthesis: initiation, elongation, and
termination (strand release).

We found that for both bacterial
cellulose synthases, primer-independent
initiation occurred throughout the course of the reaction. Many glycosyl
transferases operate by a primer-dependent mechanism for the initiation
of polymer synthesis. The primer-dependent glycogen synthase requires
a protein, glycogenin, for new strand synthesis.31 For starch synthase, there are reports of primer-dependent
and primer-independent mechanisms.32−34 However, the apparent
primer-independent enzymes may indeed be dependent upon endogenous
primers that co-purified with the enzyme.35 For plant cellulose synthase, Peng et al.,36 working with crude membrane extracts, provided compelling evidence
that sitosterol-β-glucoside acts as a primer. For bacterial
cellulose synthase, the as-isolated enzyme already contains cellulose
in the exit channel. Thus, it is similar to that of starch synthase
on ambiguity of the involvement of primers. Using two different experimental
approaches, our results show that both bacterial cellulose synthases
have no requirement for a primer, which is in contrast to the plant
system.36 This was first demonstrated by
our GPC analysis of the newly synthesized cellulose showing appearance
of cellulose strands with low DOP throughout the time course of synthesis.
We also showed that when UDP-14C-Glc was used as the substrate, 14C-Glc was detected at the reducing end of the cellulose strands.
This can only occur by the utilization of UDP-Glc as the initiator
of new strand synthesis. We also detected UDP-Glc hydrolase activity
by the purified enzyme, which provides a mechanism for initiation.
Nucleotide-sugar hydrolysis is a known activity of some glycosyl transferases.22,23,37 However, incubations with 14C-glucose and nonradioactive UDP-Glc did not result in 14C-labeled reducing ends (not shown).

Once initiated,
the enzyme enters the elongation phase that involves
multiple cycles of glucose addition until the strand is released (termination).
GPC analysis of the cellulose revealed not only a size maximum for
each enzyme (∼23 000 for G. xylinium and ∼11 700 for R. sphaeroides), but analyzing the DOP as a function of time provided rates for
elongation and for termination. Both of these rates were measured
as a function of UDP-Glc concentration to obtain values of kcat/Km and kcat. These values, in turn, were used to simulate
both steady-state kinetics and also the processivity of the two bacterial
enzymes. We were able to simulate steady-state kinetics and obtain
estimated rate constants for rates that could not be measured for
reactions involved in initiation. It is worth noting that the kcat value we determined for BcsA-BcsB of 0.5
s–1 is much lower than that determined by Omadjela
et al.12 of approximately 90 s–1. We have no apparent explanation for this discrepancy. However,
we wish to point out that our value has been verified by three different
assay methods: measuring the rate of UDP release through coupled enzyme
assays, measuring the 14C from insoluble cellulose formed,
and also from data analysis from the GPC column. In addition, we measure
the kcat values for each new preparation
of BcsA-BcsB and they are consistently within 20% of 0.5 s–1 (data not shown). Further supporting this kcat value is that our value for AcsA-AcsB, a highly homologous
enzyme, is close to 0.5 s–1 at a value of 1.7 s–1. This value is very close to that obtained by Du
et al.38 of 2.9 s–1.

In this work, we were also able to simulate the trends observed
for processivity. Given the simulation software being limited to 100
steps (where the elongation cycle involved thousands of steps), we
used parameters that would provide trends on DOP depending on the
rate constants k3 and k4. The simulation clearly provided the relationship between
translocation by one glucose unit (k4)
versus strand release (k3) and the impact
on strand length. This is corroborated by the ratio of these two rates
(k4/k3) for
AcsA-AcsB (335 000) versus BcsA-BcsB (10 000). Indeed,
the simulation shows that an increased ratio (translocation/strand
release) increases the DOP and that is observed for these two enzymes.

In regard to the structural features that may account for difference
in processivity, we reasoned that it would not be the active site.
The UDP-Glc binding site or the active site in general for both bacterial
enzymes is conserved. This is supported by the high homology in amino
acid sequence. However, the cellulose strand for both enzymes processes
through a well-defined channel.12−15 Thus, interactions within this channel may impact
both processivity and rate. Ongoing studies aim to determine structural
determinants that impact processivity.

In summary, we have shown
with purified enzymes that cellulose
synthases have intrinsic processivities. Our results show that at
least in vitro, initiation of synthesis is primer-independent. Initiation
is most likely the rate-limiting step in catalysis. Finally, with
the measured kinetic constants and our proposed mechanism, we have
been able to simulate steady-state kinetics and even processivity.
Ongoing studies aim at characterizing these parameters in plant cellulose
synthases to understand structural factors that impact cellulose strand
length.

Cellulose Synthesis and Characterization
Cellulose
was prepared for GPC analysis by modification by phenyl isocyanate
to form cellulose carbanilates.39 A volume
of 100 μL of phenyl isocyanate in 500 μL of pyridine was
added to 1 mg of cellulose under a stream of dry argon gas. Samples
were sealed in ampoules and rotated slowly at 70 °C for 48 h.
Unreacted phenyl isocyanate was quenched with 1.2 mL of methanol.
Samples were dried overnight at 40 °C under a stream of dry argon
gas, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and filtered through 0.2 μm
nylon filters (Millipore). GPC was performed with a KD-806M column
(Shodex) using tetrahydrofuran. A specific refractive index (dn/dc) of 0.169 mL g–14 was used for cellulose tricarbanilates
in tetrahydrofuran. Enzymatic synthesis of cellulose from UDP-Glc
was performed with UDP-[14C]-Glc, as described by McManus
et al.11 All reactions were performed at
30 °C or as specified in the figure legends. The synthesized
cellulose was treated with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and then
solubilized with 8% LiCl (w/v) in dimethylacetamide for GPC analysis,
as described previously.25 Radioactivity
was quantified by a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter using
ScintiVerse (Fisher Scientific) scintillation fluid.

KD-806M Column
Calibration with Native Cellulose
Avicel
(Sigma) and bacterial cellulose (G. hansenii) were dissolved in 8% LiCl (w/v) in dimethylacetamide. Injections
of 100
μL of the solution were applied onto a KD-806M column (Shodex)
and separated at a flow rate of 0.1 mL min–1. Molecular
weight determination was performed with a Dawn Helios II (Wyatt Technologies)
MALLS detector coupled with a t-REx refractometer (Wyatt Technologies).
A specific refractive index (dn/dc) of 0.0575 mL g–1 was used to calculate the molecular
weight of cellulose in 8% LiCl in dimethylacetamide.40

Reducing End Analysis by 2-Aminobenzamide
Labeling
Reducing end analysis was performed using 2-aminobenzamide
(2AB)
and fluorescent detection.21 Cellulose
was synthesized with either AcsA-AcsB or BcsA-BcsB using 1 mM UDP-[14C]-Glc (2.63 mCi mmol–1). Reactions were
quenched by the addition of 2% SDS, and the cellulose was isolated
by centrifugation and washed with water (2 × 1 mL) and then with
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (2 × 1 mL). Cellulose was resuspended
in 0.7 mL of DMSO and 0.3 mL of glacial acetic acid and modified,
as described by Parekh et al.21 The reaction
mixture was tumbled gently at 60 °C for 12 h. The modified cellulose
was isolated by centrifugation and washed with DMSO (2 × 1 mL),
water (2 × 1 mL), ethanol (1 × 1 mL), and sterile water
(1 × 1 mL). The cellulose was treated with 300 μL of 50
mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 200 U of cellulase (Worthington)
and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Following digestion, the mixture
was passed through a 3 kDa cut-off spin filter and the entire sample
was injected onto a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Supelco).
The flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1 with 10 mM sodium
acetate (pH 5.0) for 9 mL and then the solvent was changed to 10 mM
sodium acetate, pH 5.0/acetonitrile (1/9) for 10 mL. Fractions of
0.5 mL were collected for scintillation counting.

Glucose Quantification
Glucose formation from the cellulose
synthase reaction mixtures was measured using glucose oxidase and
horseradish peroxidase, as per Tsuge et al.41

Reducing End Analysis by Bicinchoninic Acid
Cellulose
was synthesized and reactions were quenched with 2% SDS, as described
above. Solution A (0.512 M Na2CO3, 0.288 M NaHCO3, and 5.0 mM bicinchoninic acid) and solution B (5.0 mM CuSO4·5 H2O and 12.0 mM l-serine) were
mixed in a 1:1 ratio immediately prior to assaying to create a working
solution. Volumes of 0.2 mL of working solution were added to 0.05
mL of water containing sample and vortexed. Samples were developed
at 80 °C for 30 min and cooled in a water bath at 25 °C
for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged, and the absorbance
of the supernatants was measured at 560 nm.26 Glucose was used for the standard curve.

Tenua Simulations
Kinetic simulations were performed
using Tenua,16 a modified version of KINSIM.
