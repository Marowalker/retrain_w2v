We
have predicted, using a wide range of theoretical models, the
potential energy surfaces of dative bond stretching in some phosphine
haloboranes and closely associated analogues. It is shown that these
dative complexes demonstrate unusual bond stretching potentials that
are characterized by having multiple inflection points and are not
able to be fit to any traditional Morse or Lennard-Jones-type curve.
Specifically, in the case of Cl3B–PH3, this effect is so pronounced that the surface actually exhibits
two distinct minima. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
example of such a unique bonding phenomenon reported for these species
and is explained by the competition between the energetic cost of
the required pyramidalization of the Lewis acid to form a dative bond
and the stabilization from the favorable attraction between the Lewis
acid and base. When the cost of pyramidalization of the Lewis acid
is high relative to the strength of the interaction between the acid
and base, the potential well associated with dative bonding is significantly
weakened and the result is a relatively flat potential energy surface
that is susceptible to the unusual characteristics described herein.

Introduction
The elucidation of
the properties of boron- and phosphorous-based
adducts has been of interest to chemists for many decades.1−9 These compounds play many important roles in synthetic chemistry
and are high-potential candidate materials for hydrogen storage.10−14 Furthermore, B–P compounds are particularly known as efficient
refractory semiconductor materials and thus are also of interest in
solid-state physics13 and have shown potential
as reducing agents in biological systems.11,12 The importance of B–P complexes in a wide range of applications
makes it critical to fully understand their structure and stability,
which has been attempted both theoretically and experimentally dating
back as far as the 1940s.1−8,15−26

Understanding the bonding in these dative complexes has been
the
subject of much research, and many differing explanations have been
offered for the trends in the bond strengths of such Lewis acids and
bases. From a theoretical perspective however, understanding dative
complexes can be a challenging task as it is well known that many
computational methods (density functional theory, or DFT, in particular)
do not describe the properties of dative bonded complexes well.27−29 Specifically with respect to B–P dative complexes, there
have been several theoretical studies employing a variety of techniques
that have revealed problematic or contradictory results.4,5,15,30−32 Janesko, for example, studied substitutions on boron
of B–P compounds and found that the popular B3LYP33 functional cannot reproduce accurate results
for bond dissociation energies.5 It has
also been reported that DFT methods produce C1 geometries
of B–P–benzene and B–P–coronene molecular
systems, whereas ab initio MP2/TZVPP34−36 and CC2/TZVPP35−37 levels of theory produce the correct D3h geometries.30 Nevertheless,
there have still been several valid attempts at rationalizing B–P
bonding from a theoretical perspective.26

In a recent paper, other seemingly spurious computational
results
in a test set of nonmetallic Lewis acid–base pairs were reported.38 On surveying the potential energy surfaces (PESs)
associated with the dative bond stretching of a series of small Lewis
acid–base pairs, it was found that fluorinated phosphoboranes
were unique in that they exhibited a shoulder at a bond length shorter
that the equilibrium bond length (see Figure 1). The PES of F3B–PH3 predicted at the reasonably reliable M06L/cc-pVQZ density
functional level is shown in Figure 1, where the inflection “shoulder” is
observed at r ≈ 2.3 Å (illustrated with
the blue dot) and the global minimum is at r ≈
3.1 Å. This is to be contrasted with the PESs of H3B–PH3 and F3B–NH3 predicted
at the same level of theory, whose curves exhibit the usual Morse-like
PES behavior for bond stretching with their minima at r ≈ 1.9 and 1.7 Å, respectively. The inset plot shows
the magnified PES of F3B–PH3 and highlights
the unusual behavior of the PES at r < req. This anomaly is not observed for either
H3B–PH3 or F3B–NH3, suggesting that this phenomenon cannot be attributed directly
to the trifluoroborane nor to the phosphine alone, but rather is the
result of the combined effects of each, perhaps in combination with
the inaccuracies of the theoretical model.

of F3B–PH3, F3B–NH3, and H3B–PH3 along the dative
bond calculated at the density functional
M06L/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The blue dot highlights an inflection
point at r < req.

Despite what is a rather long
history of theoretical and experimental
investigation of Lewis acidity and basicity in a wide range of contexts,23 this unusual behavior of the F3B–PH3 dative bond PES is quite rare and has only been observed
in one other similar case that we are aware of.39,40 Is this behavior an artifact of the calculations or a bona fide
chemical phenomenon that has yet to be fully explored? Given the importance
of these species, we endeavor to further explore the nature of the
bonding within these and other halogenated phosphoboranes by employing
a wide range of computational techniques, including several density
functional and highly accurate ab initio wave function models, comparison
with the PESs of analogous complexes, molecular orbital (MO) analysis,
and energy decomposition by systematic fragmentation of the Lewis
acid and base components. Our aim is to reveal and characterize some
rather remarkable chemical behaviors. Atomic units are used throughout
unless otherwise indicated.

Computational Methods
To probe the
nature of the PES of dative bond stretching of halogenated
phosphoboranes, a relaxed scan of the boron–phosphorous bond
was performed for several species (vide infra) with a wide variety
of electronic structure techniques. The presence of a shoulder in
the PES at r < req was confirmed by the analysis of the second derivative of the PES
curve, characterizing the shoulder inflection as a point where the
second derivative vanishes.

For all optimizations, the Lewis
acid–base bond was constrained
at 1 of 31 bond distances from 1.0 to 4.0 Å (in steps of 0.1
Å), whereas all other geometrical parameters were allowed to
fully relax. For DFT calculations, shown herein are results from the
M06L functional41 with the aug-cc-VQZ basis
(unless otherwise indicated) owing to the fact that M06L is parameterized
for inorganic species and can be quickly applied to many systems.
However, we have also coupled this functional to a much wider series
of standard basis sets (M06L/6-31G*, M06L/6-31+G**, M06L/6-311+G*,
M06L/cc-pVTZ, M06L/aug-cc-pVTZ) to investigate the basis set dependence
of the PES. Additionally, a much larger swath of functionals has been
probed, all of which exhibit qualitatively identical results (see Supporting Information). Selected PESs were also
predicted by ab initio wave function methods, including MP2/6-31G*,
MP2/6-311G*, MP2(Full)/cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/cc-pVDZ//MP2/6-31G*, CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-31G*,42,43 CR-CCL/aug-cc-pVDZ//MP2/6-31G*, CR-CCL/aug-cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-31G*,
and an extrapolated “complete basis set” (CBS) approach
for each of the coupled cluster schemes44−48 obtained from the following extrapolation formula49 1  where EDcorr and ETcorr represent correlation
energies predicted at the double-ζ and triple-ζ levels,
respectively, D = 2, and T = 3. EDT is added to the triple-ζ energy and
thus the total benchmark energy of the system (for the CR-CCL case,
for instance) is given as 2  Complete active space (CAS)50 calculations were also performed to further
probe the dependence
of PES on the effects of static correlation for several selected complexes
herein. CAS calculations correct for static correlation errors arising
from an inadequate description of the possible configuration state
functions accessible to a chemical system. In CAS, all possible Slater
determinants of a selected set of active occupied and virtual orbitals
are taken into account and full configuration interaction is calculated
on that so-called “active space”. CASSCF(8,8)/cc-pVTZ
calculations were performed after preliminary calculations of the
density matrices from a variety of sets of active spaces (specifically,
the orbital occupation numbers), where the (8,8) designation signifies
that 8 electrons were allowed to be permuted among 8 virtual molecular
orbitals. The selection of the active orbital space was decided based
on several observations from these preliminary calculations: (i) occupancies
of orbitals outside of the (8,8) active space did not change when
larger spaces were tested, (ii) the trend of the PESs obtained was
qualitatively the same regardless of the selected active space and
number of basis functions in the level of theory that was employed,
and (iii) the usual T1 diagnostic51 used
to assess multireference character in quantum systems from our coupled
cluster results was consistently well below the traditional threshold
of 0.02 for single reference acceptability. Specifically, we note
that CASSCF(6,6) and CASSCF(8,8) produce qualitatively identical results
(see Supporting Information). Additionally,
the (8,8) active space allows for the favorable pairing of occupied
and virtual orbitals in the active space, as suggested by Roos et
al.52

In cases when the curvature
of the PES was especially flat, we
have employed fine integration grids (for DFT calculations) and stringent
convergence criteria to ensure the reliability of the results. Additionally,
relevant minima were confirmed by performing the standard frequency
analysis. Consequently, we are confident that we have thoroughly explored
the space of available high-accuracy computational models suitable
for this application.

All DFT calculations were performed using
the QChem53 software package. All CR-CCL
calculations were
performed using the GAMESS48,54 suite of programs,
and all MP2, CCSD(T), and CAS calculations were performed with the
Gaussian 09 software.55

Furthermore,
the PESs of the relevant compounds of interest have
been decomposed into their Lewis acid and base components by a systematic
fragmentation approach. In this approach, we calculate the contribution
to the total PES due to the structural rearrangement of the Lewis
acid and base from their isolated structures. To accomplish this,
at each point along the PES, the electronic energies of all of the
Lewis acids and bases are calculated separately by holding them frozen
in the geometry they adopted in the full complex at that point. These
are referred to as Eacid and Ebase, respectively, and they quantify the energetic cost
of rearranging the geometries of the isolated Lewis acid or base from
their individual minimum-energy structure. The interaction energy
between each of the “frozen” fragments (Eint) may then also be calculated for each point as the
difference between the sum of the component energies (Eacid + Ebase) and that of
the original point along the PES (Etotal). 3  Decomposing the PES in this way provides considerable
insight into to the nature of bonding as the bond is stretched and/or
compressed and will be useful in our context.

Results and Discussion
PES of
F3B–PH3
The PES
of F3B–PH3 has been calculated by employing
several fundamentally different computational techniques of varying
theoretical rigor. Some representative results are plotted in Figure 2, and with very few
exceptions, the results are surprisingly consistent. In some cases,
the shoulder is more pronounced than in others; however, it persists
in all cases. This is an interesting feature that is not present in
earlier work,39,40 where such subtle features of
the PES were sensitive to the choice of theoretical model. The global
minimum in each case is usually found at ≈3.1 Å, which
is consistent with the relative weakness of the dative bond (low dissociation
limit relative to the minimum) in this case.17 Although it is nontrivial to ascertain exactly which model should
be considered the theoretical “reference” in such a
case, it is interesting to note that the shoulder point at r < req persists despite
an extensive exploration of the space of configuration state functions
and the space of basis functions.

Figure 2 PES scans of F3B–PH3 from several
levels of theory, where r represents the B–P
dative bond length in angstroms (Å) from the relaxed PES scan.

Although the MP2/cc-pVQZ model
does appear to be somewhat of an
outlier (see Supporting Information), we
have not concerned ourselves with exploring such a result further
as our primary focus is the qualitative bonding behavior in these
phosphine haloboranes (which is conserved in the MP2/cc-pVQZ curve).
Furthermore, perturbation theory is well known to produce erratic
behavior in some cases and can be highly sensitive to the choice of
the basis set.56

In terms of the
PES behavior with respect to basis set size, we
have employed up to and including the rather large augmented quadruple-ζ
basis set of Dunning,57,58 aug-cc-pVQZ, with density functional
models and up to analogous triple-ζ basis sets with highly correlated
wave function theories. It is tempting to conjecture that the shoulder
is a basis set artifact due to the fact that it appears to be diminishing
with increasing basis set size (see, for example, CR-CCL/aug-cc-pVDZ
versus CR-CCL/aug-cc-pVTZ). We cannot confirm this however, as the
shoulder persists for all models, even when a complete basis extrapolation
is employed (although the CR-CCL/CBS curve appears to be an outlier).
We can only confirm that increasing the basis set generally destabilizes
the complex at smaller bond lengths relative to longer ones, and after
about 3 Å, the curves seem to converge.

It is noteworthy
that this behavior is consistently observed in
various coupled cluster methodologies, including CR-CCL, which is
meant to be superior to the so-called “gold standard”
CCSD(T) approach for bond-breaking situations due to the triple contribution
to the energy being calibrated from the difference between the exact
solution and the CCSD energy. Even with the exploration of configuration
space via a CAS approach, we do not observe a typical Morse-like potential
shape of the PES.

Energy Decomposition
To further
explore the theoretical
rationale for such a result, the F3B–PH3 PES was decomposed into its Lewis acid and base constituents (Eacid, Ebase) as
well as the interaction energy (Eint),
as described above. These are plotted in Figure 3 along with the overall PES, Etotal.

Figure 3 PESs of the dative bond in F3B–PH3, BF3, PH3, and the interaction energy
between
the two components calculated at the M06L/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory.

Not surprisingly, the phosphine
component (Ebase) does not experience
a large fluctuation in energy at
all along the entire curve, which is a reflection of the relatively
small structural change of this trigonal pyramidal fragment as the
dative bond is formed. The boron trifluoride fragment however (Eacid) exhibits a steep relaxation energy profile
as it progresses from a highly “compressed” (and relatively
unstable) trigonal pyramidal structure at small r (and small ∠FBF) to a fully relaxed trigonal planar structure
at large r (∠FBF = 120°). The stabilizing
component of the PES comes from the favorable interaction (Eint) between each of these fragments and this
is plotted in green. Although Eint is
generally negative for most of the range plotted, the rather deep
well in the Eint curve demonstrates a
strong stabilizing interaction between the F3B–
and −PH3 fragments near ≈1.9 Å, coinciding
with the shoulder inflection in the PES.

At long range, the
electrostatic attraction of the fragments is
small but significant enough to bind them, owing to the fact that Ebase and Eacid are
negligible and the result is a global minimum predicted at r ≈ 3.2 Å. In other words, the Lewis acid and
base experience an electrostatic attraction prior to any geometrical
rearrangement.

Molecular Orbital Analysis
Analysis
of the molecular
orbitals (MOs) by visualizing and comparing them at key bond distances
provides deeper insight into these components of the PES of the complex. Figure 4 illustrates the
frontier MOs of the F3B– fragment of F3B–PH3 in geometries that match its structure at
bond lengths of 1.3, 1.9, 2.5, and 3.1 Å from the full dative
complex. Generally, the pyramidalization of the BF3 component
induces a concomitant rise in the energy of almost all of the MOs,
with the exception of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).
This orbital is primarily composed of side-on overlap of equivalent
p3 becomes more pyramidal. In the range of 1.9 ≤ r ≤ 3.1 Å, this effect lowers the LUMO energy
much more significantly than the increase in energy of the occupied
orbitals. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–LUMO
gap is therefore shrinking significantly with decreasing ∠FBF
and this is the driving force of the favorable interaction component
of the PES. The occupied orbitals of BF3 are increasing
in energy as ∠FBF decreases, which destabilizes the molecule
(Eacid) but simultaneously allows the
molecule to be more susceptible to dative bonding by an incoming lone
pair. Dative bond formation can be thought of as the sp3 → p σ donation of electron density from the Lewis base
to the acid and thus the LUMO of the Lewis acid is a significant factor
in determining the strength of the interaction.25 Although there are many ways to probe this from a theoretical
standpoint, inspection of the simple Mulliken populations in our case
indicates that the phosphine fragment becomes increasingly positive
as it approaches the haloborane. With all other things being equal,
the lower the LUMO level, the more favorable dative bond formation
will be and the more stabilizing Eint will
be. This stabilization of the BF3 LUMO increases indefinitely
with the pyramidalization of the BF3 fragment, but it is
ultimately outweighed by the unfavorable change in each of the other
MOs in the system as ∠FBF decreases.

Figure 4 Frontier MO energy-level
diagrams of the boron trifluoride fragment
of F3B–PH3, calculated at the geometries
of several bond lengths, r. Data are obtained from
a M06L/6-311+G* calculation, and images are plotted at an isovalue
of 0.07 au.

It is therefore apparent
that the unusual behavior observed in
the PES of dative bond stretching in F3B–PH3 is the result of a confluence of several factors. The Lewis
acid and base experience a long-range electrostatic attraction beginning
at about 3.5 Å. The magnitude of this attraction slowly increases
until the components reach about 2.5 Å separation, at which point
the attraction becomes much stronger and |Eint| ultimately reaches its maximum at 1.9 Å. This is consistent
with the expected Lennard-Jones-like r–6 behavior of interacting molecular species at long range. The overall
potential, however, is further complicated by the necessary pyramidalization
of the BF3 fragment to allow for dative bond formation.
Such pyramidalization results in (i) the lowering of the BF3 LUMO with the decrease in ∠FBF (subsequently stabilizing
the complex) and (ii) an associated increase in steric repulsion (destabilizing
the complex). These factors are of similar magnitude, but the destabilizing
steric repulsion is sufficient to negate the interaction energy of
the fragments at small r. Because the electrostatic
attraction is present even at large r, prior to any
significant degree of pyramidalization of the BF3 fragment,
the global minimum energy structure for this species occurs at r ≈ 3.2 Å and a feature resembling a shoulder
is observed in the PES at smaller r, where |Eint| is larger. This behavior is in agreement
with many earlier experimental investigations of F3B–PH3,17,22,23 which report
a loosely formed adduct whose bond length is difficult to determine.

Comparison with Analogous Systems
We can use this result
as the basis for a guided exploration of chemical space to further
elucidate this phenomenon. For example, if the multiple inflections
in the PES of F3B–PH3 are the result
of the interaction energy of the Lewis acid/base pair being similar
in magnitude (albeit smaller) to the energetic cost of the required
pyramidalization of the Lewis acid, then one should probe cases with
modified electrostatic interactions and steric penalties associated
with dative bond formation.

Several obvious candidates include
the aforementioned F3B–NH3 and H3B–PH3 complexes presented earlier in Figure 1. Decompositions
of their potential energy surfaces are presented in Figure 5A,B, respectively, in the same
manner as shown in Figure 3. As in the case of Figure 3, we note that Ebase does
not significantly contribute to the features in any of the overall
PESs.

Figure 5 PES scans of the dative bonds in (A) F3B–NH3, (B) H3B–PH3, and (C) Cl3B–PH3 along with their decomposed components
and the interaction energy between the fragments at various geometries,
calculated at the M06L/cc-pVQZ level of theory. The inset plot of
(C) illustrates Etotal for BCl3PH3 magnified.

In the case of F3B–NH3, we have
a
system whose Eacid is essentially the
same as that for F3B-PH3 (see Figure 5A). Although the NH3 Lewis base must get closer to the BF3 fragment for the
dative bond to form, the ∠FBN angle at req is about 104°, which compares with the ∠FBP
angle of F3B–PH3 at req of 105°. The interaction energy between the acid–base
pair, however, is significantly stronger for NH3 than for
PH3, which is consistent with the earlier theoretical work
of Bessac and Frenking.26 It is well known
that NH3 is a stronger Lewis base in this context and this
effect outweighs the cost of geometric rearrangement of the BF3 fragment, which results in a far more “typical”
PES. Alternatively, the arsenic analogue F3B–AsH3 should exhibit far weaker electrostatic interaction and,
accordingly, has not been successfully synthesized.22

We can decrease the energetic cost of pyramidilization
of the Lewis
acid by considering BH3 in the case of H3B–PH3. Figure 5B
illustrates the intuitive result that the BH3 fragment
does not exhibit a severe pyramidilization penalty (Eacid) in the relevant distance range and, as such, the
overall PES resembles the Eint curve quite
closely. Again, the result is that Eint is able to dominate Eacid and produce
a typical PES.

Our search for simple substituents on boron that
would induce a
higher cost of pyramidilization led us to consider the chlorinated
analogue BCl3, owing to the larger size of the chlorine
atoms, relative to fluorine. In their thorough review, Staubitz et
al. reported that the cost of distorting BCl3 from trigonal
planar to pyramidal was higher than that of BF3;23 however, this is in stark contrast to both Hirao
et al.24 and Frenking.25 Nonetheless, we present our results in Figure 5C for the Cl3B–PH3 complex and note a particularly remarkable result. We would
first like to point out that the Eacid is nearly identical for each of BCl3 and BF3 paired with PH3, in perfect agreement with earlier reports.24,25 What is particularly noteworthy however is that the overall PES
of the Cl3B–PH3 complex actually exhibits
two distinct minima, apparently harkening back to the classic notion
of bond stretch isomerism.59 The first
is observed at req ≈ 2.0 Å,
in close agreement with experimental estimations of the dative bond
length of this complex16 and previous geometry
optimizations performed at the density functional BP86/TZ2p level.26 The second minimum is observed at r ≈ 3.5 Å and is confirmed by several independent, fully
relaxed geometry optimizations at the density functional and ab initio
levels of theory (see Supporting Information). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a bimodal
dissociation curve for a B–P dative bond in a single small
molecule. Although similar behavior has been reported for CH3CN–BF3,40 it seems that
our distinct minima are separated by much higher energetic barriers
and consequently less sensitive to the choice of theoretical model.

This rather remarkable feature is the result of a stronger close-range
interaction between BCl3 and PH3, relative to
BF3 due to the smaller HOMO–LUMO gap in the pyramidal
chlorinated analogue (0.211 versus 0.336 au for BF3). Although
decreasing ∠ClBCl comes at a similar energetic cost to decreasing
∠FBF, the LUMO for pyramidal boron trichloride is significantly
lower than that of pyramidal boron trifluoride. This stabilizes the
dative bond and is in close agreement with earlier comparisons of
these Lewis acids.25 Because this enhanced
stabilization only occurs at a close range (i.e., r ≈ 1.9 Å), the long-range behavior of the PES is relatively
unaffected and the minimum at r ≈ 3.5 Å
persists and is comparable to the minimum observed for the F3B–PH3 analogue. At this separation, the Lewis acid
and base are electrostatically bound without the acid having to distort
its trigonal planar geometry. The fully optimized structure of Cl3B–PH3 at r ≈ 3.5
Å is shown in Figure 6. Between 2.5 and 3.0 Å, the energetic cost of pyramidalization
for BCl3 increases faster than the electrostatic attraction
of the fragments and a maxima is observed separating each distinct
minimum.

complex at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory.

Conclusions
We have shown that the potential energy
surface for dative bond
stretching in a series of haloboranes demonstrates unusual behavior
and is not able to be fit to any traditional Morse or Lennard-Jones-type
potential. Specifically, in the case of F3B–PH3, the PES exhibits a shoulder at a dative bond length shorter
than the predicted equilibrium value. Additionally, the chlorinated
analogue (Cl3B–PH3) exhibits similar
behavior but the effects are amplified and the PES is observed to
have two distinct minima. This is explained by the competition between
the energetic cost of the required pyramidalization of the Lewis acid
to form a dative bond and the stabilization from the interaction energy
between the Lewis acid and base (while being held frozen at their
respective geometries from the complex). When the cost of pyramidalization
of the Lewis acid is high relative to the electrostatic attraction
between the acid and base, the potential well associated with dative
bonding is significantly affected and the result is a relatively flat
PES that is susceptible to the unusual characteristics described herein.

The species studied in this work have been investigated by a wide
variety of computational techniques, including many DFT methods and
many levels of wave function approximations with a wide range of basis
sets. All calculations yielded qualitatively similar results. Although
the PES behavior described herein has persisted in all of our calculations,
it is important to note that atypical inflections do seem to diminish
with increasing basis set size. In particular, increasing the size
and flexibility of the basis set seems to destabilize the PES at small r, relative to the large r portion of the
curve (e.g., see Figure 1). It is conceivable that the shoulder observed for the F3B–PH3 complex PES could be resolved once higher
level theories are applied; however, the inflections are even more
pronounced for the Cl3B–PH3 complex and
the small r portion of the curve that we have presented
already agrees well with both experimental and additional theoretical
benchmarks. In any case, we expect that isolation of the weakly bound
Cl3B–PH3 complex at r ≈ 3.5 Å would be a significant experimental challenge.
