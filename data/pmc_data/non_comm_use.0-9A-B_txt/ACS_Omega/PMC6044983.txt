Using
the density functional theory method, the crystalline packing
effect on the singlet fission (SF) rate of oligorylenes, some of which
are found to exhibit SF in crystal forms, is revealed by evaluating
the effective electronic coupling (|Veff|), the square of which is proportional to the SF rate. The |Veff| values for terrylene and quaterrylene dimer
models are investigated for a variety of slip-stacked forms. It is
found that these values show similar dependences on the intermolecular
packing as a function of lateral and longitudinal displacements of
monomer frameworks, and that they are maximized in several configurations
of one monomer slipped from another along the longitudinal axis. The
present estimation method of the SF rate is also found to qualitatively
explain the experimental SF rate difference between terrylene derivatives
with different packing forms. Furthermore, by analyzing the effect
of electronic couplings on the adiabatic electronic states related
to SF, we predict several favorable molecular packings leading to
a fast SF with a high triplet yield.

1 Introduction
Singlet
fission (SF) is a photochemical process, which mostly occurs
in organic molecular aggregates. In this process, a singlet exciton
on an excited molecule interacts with another molecule in the ground
state and then splits into two triplet excitons distributed over both
molecules.1,2 This intriguing phenomenon has attracted
much attention in the broad field of science and engineering because
SF is expected to significantly improve the photoelectric conversion
efficiency of organic solar cells,3 and
drastically change the nonlinear optical properties.4,5 So far, a lot of experimental4−10 and theoretical1,2,11−14 studies have been conducted to reveal the mechanism as well as to
design efficient SF molecular systems.15−18

To establish a guideline
for screening materials that exhibit efficient
SF, the energy level matching conditions for a monomer was proposed
by Smith and Michl.1,2 This guideline states that molecules,
which have the singlet excitation energy slightly higher than or nearly
equal to twice the triplet excitation energy (E(S1) > 2E(T1) or E(S1) ≈ 2E(T1)), are
energetically favorable for SF [condition (i)]. Here, E(S1) and 2E(T1) approximately
represent the energies of singlet exciton (S1S0) and double–triplet exciton (T1T1)
states of the dimer, respectively. In addition to condition (i), a
second condition (ii) 2E(T1) < E(T2) is required to suppress the triplet–triplet
recombination of the split triplet pair. From this fundamental guideline,
large alternant hydrocarbons and biradicaloids are proposed to be
promising molecular systems for efficient SF.18 This guideline based on the energy level matching conditions has
been refined by introducing the multiple diradical character,19 that is, diradical (y0) and tetraradical (y1) characters (0
≤ y0 and y1 ≤ 1.0): molecules which have a relatively small diradical
character (∼0.1 < y0 < ∼0.4)
and smaller tetraradical character (y1/y0 < ∼0.2) are candidates
for efficient SF materials.15,16,20 This diradical character-based guideline can select biradicaloids
suitable for efficient SF candidates and can sort out some exceptions
of alternant hydrocarbons such as phenacenes, which are nearly closed-shell
and do not exhibit SF.16 As a result, the
feasible region for efficient SF materials is shown on the y0–y1 map.15

Following this diradical character-based
design principle, oligorylenes,
including perylene, terrylene, quaterrylene, and pentaterrylene, have
been investigated in terms of the theoretical correlation between
the diradical character and relevant excitation energies calculated
using the time-dependent tuned long-range corrected density functional
theory (DFT) Becke, Lee, Yang, and Parr (TD-tuned-LC-BLYP) method.20 As a result, terrylene and quaterrylene have
been found to lie in the efficient SF region on the y0–y1 map and satisfy
the energy level matching conditions (i) and (ii). Recently, two terrylene
derivatives, which have different stacking structures in crystalline
thin films, have been synthesized by Eaton et al.,21 and according to our theoretical prediction,20 they have been confirmed to undergo SF by the
transient absorption experiment. In addition, these derivatives have
been revealed to have different triplet formation timescales and different
triplet yields depending on their crystalline thin films. It has been
implied that the origin of the different SF behaviors lies in the
different intermolecular configurations in crystal packing, as inferred
in other theoretical and experimental studies on the relationship
between SF behaviors and intermolecular packing22−26 or intramolecular packing.27−30 From those results, stacking
displacements of chromophore frameworks as well as the variation in
the interchromophore distances31,32 are expected to significantly
affect the SF efficiency. Thus, the clarification of the intermolecular
packing effects on the SF efficiency in molecular aggregates as well
as the quest for optimal intermolecular packing forms for SF are indispensable
for realizing efficient SF materials.

In this study, we investigate
the intermolecular packing effects
on the SF of terrylene and quaterrylene because they are predicted
to be good candidates for the SF monomer as mentioned above, but their
electronic structures related to SF are still poorly understood in
the condensed phase. We consider the dimer models composed of these
compounds and clarify the influence of dimer packing forms on the
SF performances by evaluating the effective electronic couplings related
to the SF rate. In addition, the effective energetics for SF obtained
from the related electronic couplings are investigated in various
slip-stacked terrylene or quaterrylene dimer configurations, including
the real crystal packing geometries. From these calculation results,
we propose several favorable intermolecular packing forms for further
improving the SF performances in oligorylenes as well as in related
planar π-conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.

2 Methods and Model
2.1 Computational Methods
From Fermi’s
golden rule combined with the quasi-degenerate perturbation theory,33 the SF rate from S1S0 to
T1T1 is predicted to be proportional to the
square of the effective electronic coupling for the SF rate Veff,2,29,33 1a  where 1b  A and B are indices of the molecule in the
dimer subset, and hi and lj denote the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) of molecule i and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of molecule j, respectively. ES1S0, ET1T1,
and ECT represent the energy levels of
S1S0, T1T1, and charge-transfer
(CT) state. By the change of intermolecular packing in the dimer subset, Veff is thought to vary due to the change in
the overlaps of the concerned molecular orbitals.

In addition
to the SF rate, intermolecular packing is predicted to affect the
energetics of SF.13,34,35 We investigate the effect of the electronic couplings on the nonperturbed
energy levels of the initial (S1S0) and final
(T1T1) states by applying the quasi-degenerate
perturbation theory.33 By this treatment,
one can consider effective SF energetics through the relative relationship
of diagonal elements of the effective Hamiltonian Heff, which is the 3 × 3 matrix expressed as 2a  Here, Veff is
defined in eq 1a, and
other quantities in eq 2a are given by 2b   2c  and 2d  where JCoul is
the Coulomb coupling. The details of derivation for eqs 1a, 1b, and 2a–2d are summarized
in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Model
We consider two types of oligorylenes,
terrylene and quaterrylene (Figure 1), and construct slip-stack dimer models of them (Figure 2), where x and y axes indicate the longitudinal
and lateral directions, respectively, and z axis
represents the stacking direction. The center of the red-colored molecule
(lower molecule of the dimer) is located at the origin of the coordinate
axis. The values of z, interplanar distances, are
fixed at 3.31 Å in the terrylene dimer model and at 3.41 Å
in the quaterrylene dimer model; both of them are extracted from their
real crystal structures.21,36 Note here that for
comprehension of the primary correlation between the SF efficiency
and intermolecular packing, we focus only on the dimer subset and
ignore the effect of singlet exciton delocalization and polarizations
of external molecules, which are not predicted to much affect the
relative variation of electronic coupling. The geometries of the terrylene
and quaterrylene monomers were optimized using DFT with the B3LYP
functional and the 6-31G* basis set: the D2h symmetry was imposed for both terrylene and quaterrylene.
The Fock matrix of the displaced dimers was also calculated by DFT
with the same functional and basis set. These quantum chemical calculations
were all performed by Gaussian 09.37 The
energies of S1S0 and T1T1 states of the dimer (ES1S0 and ET1T1, respectively) are taken from our previous study on SF in oligorylenes: ES1S0 = 2.29 eV and ET1T1 = 2.20 eV for terrylene
and ES1S0 = 1.88
eV and ET1T1 = 1.60
eV for quaterrylene.20 These energies were
all calculated on monomers under the assumption ES1S0 ≈ E(S1) and ET1T1 ≈ 2E(T1) without any electronic
interaction effect between monomers.

between carbon atoms in the optimized monomers are also shown here.
Only single C–C bonds are shown here for simplicity. The blue-colored
numbers on carbon atoms indicate atom numbers.

quaterrylene dimer model, the coordinate axis definition is the same
except for z = 3.41 Å.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Fock
Matrix Elements
First, we examine
the dependence of Fock matrix elements of oligorylenes on the intermolecular
configurations in the dimer. Figure 3 shows the Fock matrix elements, ⟨hA|F|hB⟩,
⟨hA|F|lB⟩, ⟨lA|F|hB⟩, and ⟨lA|F|lB⟩, in the terrylene dimer model. In the same manner
as in Figure 3, Figure S1 shows the Fock matrix elements in the
quaterrylene dimer model. From Figures 3 and S1 and the previous
study on pentacene,23 each Fock matrix
element is found to have similar node positions for these molecules
because of similarity in their molecular orbital distributions. Figure 4 shows the HOMOs
and LUMOs of terrylene and quaterrylene. One should pay attention
to the different axis definitions in the present study on oligorylenes
and those in ref (23) on pentacene, that is, the x and y axes in the present study correspond to T and L axes in ref (23), respectively.

Figure 3 Calculated Fock matrix elements, ⟨hA|F|hB⟩
(a), ⟨hA|F|lB⟩ (b), ⟨lA|F|hB⟩
(c), and ⟨lA|F|lB⟩ (d), in the terrylene dimer
model defined in Figure 2. The values in the color bar are given in meV.

Figure 4 HOMO and LUMO of (a) terrylene and (b) quaterrylene. The white
and blue surfaces indicate contours with ±0.02 a.u., respectively.

As seen from Figure 3a, ⟨hA|F|hB⟩
changes its sign along both x- and y-slipping vectors. In slipped configurations
along the x-axis, ⟨hA|F|hB⟩
takes local maxima at x = 0.0 and 4.8 Å, whereas
it takes local minima at x = 2.4 and 7.2 Å.
At the local maximum configurations, x = 0.0 and
4.8 Å, it is shown that the HOMOs between the cofacial monomers
maximally overlap with each other with mutually opposite phases because
the terrylenes stack in the perylene unit regions (see Figure 5a,b). At the local minimum
configurations, x = 2.4 and 7.2 Å, the upper
and lower monomers stack by overlapping the π orbitals at one
end of each C–C bond between the upper and lower monomers,
such as stacking of the C3 atom of the lower monomer with the C2 atom
of the upper one (see Figure 5c,d). In these configurations, the HOMOs between the cofacial
monomers are shown to give maximal overlap with mutually opposite
phases.

Figure 5 Terrylene dimer configurations. Local maxima of ⟨hA|F|hB⟩:
(a) (x,y) = (0.0
Å,0.0 Å) and (b) (x,y)
= (4.8 Å,0.0 Å); local minima of ⟨hA|F|hB⟩:
(c) (x,y) = (2.4 Å,0.0 Å)
and (d) (x,y) = (7.2 Å,0.0
Å); local maxima of ⟨hA|F|lB⟩: (e) (x,y) = (1.0 Å,0.0 Å) and (f) (x,y) = (5.4 Å,0.0 Å); local minima of ⟨hA|F|lB⟩: (g) (x,y) = (3.2
Å,0.0 Å); and (h) suspicious candidate packing (x,y) = (5.8 Å,0.0 Å). The blue
and gray skeletons indicate the upper and lower terrylenes, respectively.

From Figure 3b,c,
one can apparently notice that the elements ⟨hA|F|lB⟩
and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩ have the same amplitude with mutually
opposite sign at all coordinates, and this is the case with quaterrylene
(see Figure S1). This feature in ⟨hA|F|lB⟩ and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩ is also observed
in the pentacene dimer model23 because
of the similar periodic and symmetric HOMO and LUMO distributions
of the monomer. Thus, ⟨lA|F|hB⟩ can be expressed
as ⟨lA|F|hB⟩ = −⟨hA|F|lB⟩,
and this relationship is found to be valid in other planar π-conjugated
polycyclic hydrocarbons as long as the same displacing definition
as in the present model and the symmetrical molecular structure are
used. The local maximum peaks of ⟨hA|F|lB⟩ are found
at x = 1.0 and 5.4 Å, whereas that of local
minimum is found at x = 3.2 and 7.5 Å. In the
case of y = 0.0 Å, the lower and upper monomers
stack only with one end of each carbon(C)–carbon(C) bond, such
as stacking of the C2 atom of the lower monomer with the C2 atom of
the upper at (x,y) = (1.0 Å,0.0
Å) (see Figure 5e,f).

From Figure 3d,
it can be seen that unlike ⟨hA|F|hB⟩, ⟨hA|F|lB⟩, and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩, the element ⟨lA|F|lB⟩ does not show sign changes in the slips along the x-axis. As seen from Figure 4a,b, this can be explained by the constant phase of
LUMO along the longitudinal axis of the molecule.

3.2 Effective Electronic Coupling for the SF Rate
In this
section, we discuss the dependence of effective electronic
coupling amplitude for the SF rate, |Veff|, on the intermolecular configurations. The |Veff| values for terrylene and quaterrylene calculated by using eq 1a with the Fock matrix elements
and ECT are shown in Figures 6 and S2, respectively. The variation of ECT as
a function of coordinate (x,y) is
shown in Figure S3.

Figure 6 |Veff| for the SF rate in terrylene.
The values in the color bar are given in meV.

As seen from Figure 6 and S2, in the y-axis
slips of both terrylene and quaterrylene, |Veff| gradually decreases with increase of the y value for any x value. In this regard, y-axis slips and short-axis slips in oligorylenes are found
to just contribute to weakening of |Veff|, so that the variation of |Veff| by x-axis slips is examined. In x-axis slips,
there are shown to be several local maximum points of |Veff|, for example, at x = 0.7, 3.7, and
5.1 Å. It is noted that |Veff| is
zero at (x,y) = (0.0 Å,0.0
Å), in spite of the fact that the upper and lower monomers could
maximally overlap in this configuration. As seem from Figure 3, at (x,y) = (0.0 Å,0.0 Å), the horizontal couplings,
⟨hA|F|hB⟩ and ⟨lA|F|lB⟩,
take maximum values, but the nonhorizontal couplings, ⟨hA|F|lB⟩ and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩, are vanished.
As seen from eq 1a, therefore,
|Veff| takes zero in the maximally overlapped
configuration, (x,y) = (0.0 Å,0.0
Å). One should pay attention that the nonadiabatic coupling between
the adiabatic S1S0 and T1T1 states, which is related to the transition rate from the adiabatic
S1S0 to T1T1 state, at
this configuration for the ethylene dimer model is not zero but 50%
smaller than those in slipped-stack configurations.38

The global maximum of |Veff| is found
to be taken in around (x,y) = (0.7
Å,0.0 Å), both in terrylene and quaterrylene. In this configuration,
it is found that the upper and lower monomers overlap in almost the
entire region, and thus both ⟨hA|F|hB⟩ and ⟨lA|F|lB⟩ take large values, though the nonhorizontal couplings,
⟨hA|F|lB⟩ and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩,
are not zero. It is noted that this configuration approximately corresponds
to the slip-stacked configuration with the half of a C–C bond
length (0.74 Å estimated from Figure 1) along the longitudinal axis of the terrylene
backbone. In the previous study in ref (2), it was pointed out that the electronic coupling
related to the SF rate in the dimer models is enhanced with the slip-stacked
configuration along the HOMO to LUMO transition moment. In the present
model of oligorylenes, the HOMO to LUMO transition moment is placed
on the longitudinal axis of terrylene or quaterrylene (see Figure 4). Therefore, the
present result is in agreement with the prediction in the previous
study,2 although the present molecular
sizes are larger than the previous ones. In another local maximum
configuration, for example, at (x,y) = (3.7 Å,0.0 Å), the slip length along the x-axis approximately corresponds to the sum of the largest edge length
of a benzene unit (2.89 Å) and the half of the C–C bond
length (0.74 Å). In another local maximum configuration at (x,y) = (5.1 Å,0.0 Å), it corresponds
to the sum of the largest edge length of a benzene unit (2.89 Å)
and a C–C bond length (1.47 Å) and its half (0.74 Å).
Neglecting the bond-length alternations and considering a benzene
unit as a hexagonal structure, the largest edge length of a benzene
unit can be regarded as twice the length of a C–C bond. Therefore,
the configurations where |Veff| value
takes global or local maxima are considered to have a geometrical
regularity, where the |Veff|-maximized
dimer configuration is characterized by the longitudinal displacement
with “the half of a C–C bond length together with the
integer multiple of the C–C bond length in benzene units”.
This designing strategy of intermolecular packing for fast SF is expected
to be applicable to other SF candidates of planar π-conjugated
polycyclic hydrocarbons, by virtue of their common structural units
of benzene. Note here that these configurations are discussed in terms
of the maximum point of |Veff|: even in
the case of the not |Veff|-maximized configuration
but of configuration giving relatively large |Veff|, there is a possibility to undergo fast SF.

On the
other hand, for avoiding smaller |Veff|, it is not recommended to prepare oligorylene or related
systems with the crystal packing of the longitudinal displacement
just with “the integer multiple of the C–C bond length
in benzene units”, of course including perfect stacking of
(x,y) = (0.0 Å,0.0 Å).
As seen from Figure 4, the phase of HOMO on each carbon atom of a longitudinal C–C
bond has an opposite sign to the other, whereas that of LUMO has the
same sign between both the carbon atoms. Therefore, in these configurations,
the overlap of HOMO and LUMO between monomers are predicted to be
canceled out on each stacked longitudinal C–C bond. Accordingly,
in these configurations, it is predicted that ⟨hA|F|lB⟩
and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩ are vanished, resulting in the minima
of |Veff|. Indeed, peropyrene, which is
a polycyclic hydrocarbon chromophore similar to oligorylenes in their
monomer structures and MO distributions, was reported not to exhibit
rapid SF, where the monomers in a dimer subset of peropyrene are slip-stacked
with a C–C bond length along the longitudinal axis.39

3.3 Perturbed Energy Levels
of S1S0 and T1T1
In this section,
we further analyze the results shown in the previous section by using
the quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. According to this theory,
we discuss the variation of energy levels related to SF because of
the electronic couplings between the monomers, which provides the
effective energy levels in SF. The systematic and more detailed introduction
of this theory to the exciton states in SF is given in our previous
study.40 We here focus on the relative
relationship of the perturbed energy levels of S1S0 and T1T1, the diagonal-elements in eq 2a. As shown in eqs 2b–2d, the effect of the CT states-mediated coupling is included in the
perturbation energies (ΔET1T1 and ΔES1S0) and in the effective exciton–exciton
coupling Jeff between S1S0 and S0S1, which includes its perturbation
term JCT (see eq 2d). When the mixing of CT states to S1S0 or T1T1 state is large, the perturbed ES1S0 or ET1T1 gets apart from the nonperturbed
one. If the perturbed energy level of T1T1 gets
below the perturbed one of S1S0, SF is predicted
to proceed exothermally, and thus SF triplet yield is expected to
increase.

On the basis of the longitudinal-axis-slip-stack terrylene
and quaterrylene dimer models defined in section 2.2, we discuss feasible intermolecular packing,
which can realize a fast SF with a high triplet yield, that is, exothermal
SF. Figure 7 shows
|Veff| for terrylene discussed in the
last section and the perturbed energy levels, ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 and ET1T1 + ΔET1T1, and ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 split by the effective exciton–exciton
coupling Jeff, where we consider the possible
lowest split energy level, ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 – |Jeff|. These
quantities for quaterrylene are shown in Figure S4. Because ES1S0 and ET1T1 are smaller than ECT in the present
systems and the numerators in eqs 2b and 2c are given in positive
values, the energy perturbation terms ΔES1S0 and ΔET1T1 are shown to be negative and are
expected to stabilize the nonperturbed ES1S0 and ET1T1, respectively. As seen from Figure 7, for terrylene in all x-axis-slipped dimer configurations, the energy levels of
the nonperturbed S1S0 and T1T1 are found to be swayed and lowered by the perturbation terms
ΔES1S0 and
ΔET1T1, respectively,
because of the individual variation of the Fock matrix elements. The
effect of |Jeff| on the energy splitting
between S1S0 and S0S1 is
found to be crucial for expecting exothermal SF, that is, |Jeff| makes much lower the level of ES1S0 + ΔES1S0, especially in the configurations
where ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 takes minima. Therefore,
from the viewpoint of generating more triplet excitons, it is indispensable
to weaken the impact of |Jeff| as well
as ΔES1 by optimizing
intermolecular packing. Unfortunately, as is the case with pentacene
dimers,40 the stabilized energy levels
of S1S0 seems to be overestimated due to large
horizontal Fock matrix elements in small x regions
(x < 1.0 Å), where ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 fall below ET1T1 + ΔET1T1 by more than 1000 meV. At any rate,
in these largely overlapped configurations of chromophores, the excimer
formation is predicted to occur because of the largely stabilized
S1 energy level, the feature of which prevents the creation
of the double-triplet exciton. Such an excimer formation caused by
the significantly stabilized S1 energy level is also observed
in the real crystal of cofacially stacked simplest oligorylene, perylene.41 On the other hand, it turns out that at x = 1.2 Å and 3.3 Å, both ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 and ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 – |Jeff| take maxima, whereas ET1T1 + ΔET1T1 takes minima. It is consequently found that around x = 1.2 and 3.3 Å, ET1T1 + ΔET1T1 gets lower than ES1S0 + ΔES1S0, and thus exothermal SF can be expected.
It is also noted that |Veff| takes relatively
large values in these dimer configurations, about 270 meV for x = 1.2 Å and 250 meV for x = 3.3
Å. Combining the results of the estimated |Veff| and the perturbed exciton-state energies, it can
be expected that a fast and exothermal SF coexists in these dimer
configurations, that is, at x = 1.2 and 3.3 Å
(see Figure 5e,g).
Considering overlaps of the existing terrylene derivatives42 and slip-stacked crystal packing in π-conjugated
polycyclic hydrocarbons,43,44 these dimer configurations
are expected to be realized. These energy levels are estimated based
on the perturbation theory, which allows us to illustrate effective
SF energetics in a simple way based on electronic coupling. In addition,
when the dimer subset is embedded in the crystalline bulk, the CT
energy is predicted to be stabilized due to polarizations of the surrounding
molecules.45 Thus, the present effective
energy levels would somewhat differ from those in the realistic bulk
crystal. We have estimated the effect of this stabilization by examining
the effective energy levels for models with evenly decreased ECT. As a result, it is found that the relative
relationship between the perturbed S1S0 and
T1T1 energy levels is not changed, though the
absolute value of each energy level is significantly changed (see Figure S5). This implies that the present conclusions
are qualitatively valid even in the realistic bulk crystal.

Figure 7 Perturbed energy
levels of S1S0 (blue solid
line) and T1T1 (red solid line) in the slipped-stack
terrylene dimer model defined in Figure 2. The value of x [Å]
indicates the slip length along the longitudinal axis of the molecular
backbone. The dashed horizontal lines denote the nonperturbed energy
levels of ES1S0 (blue
dashed line) and ET1T1(red dashed line), with the values of ES1S0 = 2.29 eV and ET1T1 = 2.20 eV, respectively.20 The two blue solid lines denote the perturbed ES1S0, ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 (with white squares), and the
possible lowest split energy of ES1S0, ES1S0 + ΔES1S0 – |Jeff| (with blue squares).
The red solid line denotes the perturbed ET1T1 and ET1T1 + ΔET1T1. The green solid line denotes the |Veff| value in the corresponding slipped-stack configuration.

For quaterrylene in Figure S4, the variation
features of the perturbed exciton-state energies for the molecular
displacement are shown to be similar to those of terrylene, so that
the candidate packings for efficient SF in quaterrylene is found to
be the same as that in terrylene with x = 1.2 and
3.3 Å. In addition, as seen from Figures 7 and S4, around x = 5.8 Å for terrylene and x = 5.5
Å for quatterylene, the perturbed energy level of S1S0 is apparently higher than that of T1T1. However, in terrylene with x = 5.8 Å,
the |Veff| value is shown to be small
(47 meV), and the overlap area between the monomers is predicted to
be too small to configure realistic crystal packing in such π-conjugated
systems (see Figure 5h), so that an efficient SF is less expected in this dimer configuration.
On the other hand, it is found that in quaterrylene with x = 5.5 Å, |Veff| takes a relatively
large value (123 meV), and the overlap area is relatively large (see Figure S6), so that this configuration is feasible
and is expected to be a candidate packing for efficient SF in quaterrylene
in addition to the configurations x = 1.2 and 3.3
Å.

3.4 Application to Real Crystal Packings of Terrylenes
In this section, we apply the present method for the evaluation
of two types of dimer subsets in the crystal structures of terrylene
derivatives, 2,5,10,13-tetra(tert-butyl)terrylene
(1) and 2,5-di(tert-butyl)terrylene
(2). As mentioned in the introduction, it was reported
that 1 and 2 have different stacking geometries,
SF rates, and triplet yields, where the observed SF in 1 was faster and gave a smaller triplet yield than 2.21 The structural data available for constructing
these configurations were taken from ref (21). Their packing configurations are shown in Figure S7.

Table 1 lists the calculated result of Fock matrix
elements, JCoul and ECT, for the dimer subsets in 1 and 2. The comparison of |Veff| calculated
from these elements is shown in Table 2. As seen from Table 1, the absolute value of each Fock matrix element of 2 is found to be larger than that of 1 because
of the smaller interplanar distance between monomers of 2 than that of 1. Thus, the electronic coupling of 2 seems to be larger than that of 1, but in fact,
|Veff| for 1 is found to
be larger than that for 2, as seen from Table 2. This can be explained as follows.
As seen from Table 1, the nonhorizontal couplings, ⟨hA|F|lB⟩ and ⟨lA|F|hB⟩, have the opposite sign in 1, whereas
in 2, they have the same sign. This opposite sign relation
of these nonhorizontal couplings between 1 and 2 is understood by considering the different molecular orbital
(MO) overlapping for the nonhorizontal couplings in 2, which includes a monomer stacked with 180° rotation around
the short axis of the molecule in 2 (see Supporting Information). It is found that according
to the different MO phase relationship in 2, the amplitudes
of |Veff| for 1 and 2 are not only straightforwardly estimated from the difference
of interplanar distances but are also obtained from the combination
of each element in eq 1a. As a result, the |Veff| value for 1 is shown to be larger than that for 2. The
SF rate is characterized by the SF timescale τSF,
which is proportional to the inverse of the square of the |Veff| value, τSF ∝ 1/|Veff|2. By comparing the 1/|Veff|2 values and the experimental
τSF values summarized in Table 2, the calculated |Veff| values for 1 and 2 are shown
to reproduce the experimental results qualitatively. Judging from
this good agreement with the experiment, the present evaluation scheme
of |Veff| is concluded to be a useful
method for investigating the effect of intermolecular packing on the
SF rate and searching for the packing forms yielding large SF rates,
at least under the comparisons in the same chromophore dimer subset.

On the other hand, as for the effective energetics
of 1 and 2 in SF, the perturbed energy levels
of S1S0 (denoted as  excluding
the energy splitting by |Jeff| and as  including
it), T1T1 (denoted as ), and their
effective difference (denoted
as ) are shown
in Table 2. The  values both
in 1 and 2 are shown to be negative with
−72 and −22
meV, respectively; that is, it is expected that SF occurs endothermically
both in 1 and 2 and more endothermically
in 1 than in 2. This difference of the effective
energy levels between 1 and 2 is expected
to explain the different experimental triplet yields between them.
As seen from eqs 2b and 2c and the values shown in Table 1, the perturbation energies (ΔET1T1 and ΔES1S0) do not affect crucially
the difference of energy levels of S1S0 and
T1T1 between 1 and 2; in fact, the differences of  and  between 1 and 2 are calculated to be only 4 and 11 meV,
respectively. Thus, the
origin of their different effective energy levels is predicted to
lie in the effective excitonic coupling |Jeff|. From eq 2d and the
values shown in Table 1, the signs of JCoul are shown to be
negative both in 1 and 2, and the sign of JCT is shown to be negative in 1 while positive in 2. It is therefore found that in
the case of 1, the amplitude of |Jeff| gets constructively larger, whereas in the case of 2, the amplitude of |Jeff| gets smaller because of the opposite sign
of JCoul and JCT. It is noted that although  takes negative
values both in 1 and 2 and hence their SF
are expected to proceed endothermically,
the triplet yields observed in the experiment are large enough (170
± 20 and 200 ± 30%, respectively21), and these large triplet yields in their real crystal are more
or less predicted to originate in the close  and  levels.

In the literature for 1 and 2, the energetics
estimated from the absorption spectroscopies was concluded to be the
same, ES1S0 = 1.93
eV and ET1T1 = 2.00
eV,21 so that the different SF performances
that originated from different crystal packings of 1 and 2 were not fully explained only by such observables. As shown
in this study, the consideration of effective energetics in the SF
process, which is not obtained by the above absorption spectroscopy,
including the effect of CT-mixing of intermolecular electronic couplings
is indispensable for understanding the SF rate and triplet yield.
As a result, the proposed method is shown to complement the experimental
results and explain successfully both for the SF rate and SF triplet
yield. We here note that the present methodology does not calculate
their real values. Therefore, other factors such as the external effect
on the dimer and the vibronic coupling should be taken into consideration
for a more detailed discussion. Nevertheless, electronic couplings
and the relative effective energy levels have been elucidated to be
important factors for the difference in the SF rate and triplet yield.

Finally, we compare the features of SF between the candidate packings
proposed in section 3.3 and the experimental ones for 1 and 2.
We can expect further faster SF and larger SF triplet yields in those
candidate packings than in 1 and 2 packings.
This is understood as follows. In the candidate packings, |Veff| values are shown to be 1 order of magnitude
larger than those calculated in 1 and 2 packings,
which leads to 2 or more orders of magnitude faster SF than 1 and 2 packings, and the effective energetics
for the present candidates implies exothermic SF, though 1 and 2 packings were reported to be endothermic. In
addition, |Veff| values in the present
candidate packings for oligorylenes are found to be larger than previously
reported electronic couplings in the real crystals of polyacenes,
though |Veff| is not exactly the same
quantity as their electronic couplings.44 Therefore, the SF rates of the present candidate packings of oligorylenes
have a possibility to exceed those of well-studied systems such as
tetracene and pentacene.

4 Conclusions
We have
investigated the SF rate and the effective energetics in
SF based on the analysis of the electronic couplings of two types
of oligorylenes, terrylene and quaterrylene. For the SF rate, we have
estimated the effective electronic couplings (|Veff|) using the related electronic couplings for various packing
forms. |Veff| in the present model has
local maxima in several longitudinal slip-stacked configurations,
where fast SF can be expected. On the other hand, for the effective
energetics in SF, we have analyzed the variation of energy levels
of the perturbed S1S0 and T1T1 states, particularly in the longitudinal slip-stacked oligorylenes.
The effective energy gap between the perturbed S1S0 and T1T1 states has been revealed to
drastically change by the modification of relative configurations
between the monomers. Combining the results of |Veff| and the effective energetics in SF, we have proposed
several candidate molecular packing forms for a more efficient SF
in oligorylene systems. Moreover, the present method has been shown
to explain a qualitative difference in SF performances of the two
real crystal packings of terrylene. Therefore, the present method
contributes to realizing the rational design of efficient SF materials
by controlling the intermolecular packing, that is, crystal engineering.
The present results will stimulate both theoretical investigations
and experimental crystal engineering for preparing highly efficient
SF materials, though there still remains unexplored issues on SF in
oligorylenes, such as vibronic coupling effects46,47 and exciton dynamics.22−24,48−50 In addition to these aspects, the assessment of applicability
of the present simpler adiabatic model to a realistic multiconfigurational
model13,51,52 and the theoretical
treatment of morphology in the condensed phase for SF53−55 are indispensable for the future comprehensive understanding of
SF.
