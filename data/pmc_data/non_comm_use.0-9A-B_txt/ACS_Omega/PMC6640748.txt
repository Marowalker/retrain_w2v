The
determination at atomic resolution of the three-dimensional
molecular structure of membrane proteins such as receptors and several
ion channels has been a major breakthrough in structural biology.
The molecular structure of several members of the superfamily of voltage-gated
ionic channels such as K+ and Na+ is now available.
However, despite several attempts, the molecular structure at atomic
resolution of the full cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel,
although a member of the same superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels,
has not been obtained yet, neither by X-ray crystallography nor by
electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). It is possible that CNG channels
have a high structural heterogeneity, making difficult crystallization
and single-particle analysis. To address this issue, we have combined
single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and electrophysiological
experiments to characterize the structural heterogeneity of CNGA1
channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain had force peaks,
occurring with a probability from 0.2 to 0.96. Force peaks during
the unfolding of the transmembrane domain had a probability close
to 1, but the distribution of the increase in contour length between
two successive force peaks had multiple maxima differing by tens of
nanometers. Concomitant electrophysiological experiments showed that
the rundown in mutant channels S399C is highly variable and that the
effect of thiol reagents when specific residues were mutated was consistent
with a dynamic structural heterogeneity. These results show that CNGA1
channels have a wide spectrum of native conformations that are difficult
to detect with X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM.

Introduction
The determination at
atomic resolution of the three-dimensional
(3D) molecular structure of several ion channels, such as voltage-gated
ion channels like potassium and sodium channels,1,2 has
been a major breakthrough in structural biology. However, the structure
of the full cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel, although a
member of the same superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels, has
not been obtained yet, neither by X-ray crystallography nor by electron
cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). CNG channels could have a large number of
distinct conformational states3 so that
the usual methods for determining the 3D molecular structure fail.
Indeed, crystallography captures only the most stable conformation
among a variety of different states.4,5 Crystallography
and Cryo-EM require purified membrane proteins, which are subsequently
analyzed in a nonphysiological environment (low temperature, detergent,
and absence of the plasma membrane). Cryo-EM is a single-molecule
technique and therefore can reveal, to some extent, the conformational
transition and structural heterogeneity of an ionic channel, as demonstrated
for TRPV1, TRPV2, and MloK1 channels.6−10 Therefore, it is important to verify the degree of the structural
heterogeneity of CNG channels, possibly in their native environment.

To address this issue, we have combined single-molecule force spectroscopy
(SMFS) and electrophysiological experiments to characterize the structural
heterogeneity of CNGA1 channels expressed in Xenopus
laevis oocytes. SMFS provides some structural information
at the single-molecule level under almost physiological conditions,
useful to characterize the structural heterogeneity of membrane proteins.
In SMFS experiments,11−19 the protein under investigation is pulled and unfolded, and the
resulting F–D curve is composed
of a series of force peaks. In these experiments, a drop of the force
necessary to unfold the protein causes the appearance of a force peak:
its occurrence signals that an unfolded region or a poorly structured
polypeptide is in the process of being unfolded. If the protein to
be unfolded is a membrane protein, such as an ion channel, then the
unfolding of the transmembrane domain occurs sequentially so that
it is possible to identify the location of the unfolded region with
an accuracy of some amino acids (a.a.). The location of a force peak
is obtained by fitting the experimental F–D curve with the Worm-Like Chain (WLC) model,20,21 providing the values of the contour lengths (Lc). From the value
of Lc, it is possible to estimate with a good accuracy the number
of a.a.21 as ΔLc/0.4 nm, where ΔLc
is the increase of Lc between two consecutive force peaks of the unfolded
polypeptide and therefore to probe the structural heterogeneity.22,23 In a recent investigation,24 we have
used SMFS to examine conformational changes during the gating of CNGA1
channels that are expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes,25−27 that is, a physiological-like membrane and we observed
the existence of multiple peaks in the distribution of the values
of ΔLc between consecutive force peaks during the unfolding
of the transmembrane domain of CNGA1 channels and in the present article,
we extend this analysis to the cytoplasmic domain and to the N-terminal
of these channels both in the open (in the presence of 2 mM cGMP)
and closed states (in the absence of cGMP). We found a high variability,
consistent with the existence of several distinct native conformations,
confirmed by electrophysiological experiments.

Results
Unfolding Variability
of CNGA1 Channels in the Open and Closed
States
Voltage-gated ion channels form a large superfamily
including also CNG channels25−31 that are opened by the binding of cyclic nucleotides with a gating,
which is also voltage-dependent.25 CNG
channels are formed by four subunits, either of type A (CNGA1, CNGA2,
CNGA3, CNGA4, and CNGA5) or of type B (CNGB1 and CNGB2). CNGA1 channels
are homomeric channels composed of four subunits and have functional
properties similar, but not identical to, those of native CNG channels.
The CNGA1 subunit from bovine rods is composed of 690 a.a., and hydropathicity
and biochemical analyses28 have identified
six transmembrane α-helices referred as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5,
and S6 that are linked by nonspanning loops, which are either extracellular
or intracellular. There is a pore region between S5 and S6 where ion
permeation occurs. Both the N- and C-terminals are cytoplasmic with
the C-terminal (N400–D690) being a large domain composed of
the C-linker (N400–E482) and the cyclic nucleotide binding
(CNB) domain (A483–N610).32,33 Although electrophysiological
properties of these channels have been extensively clarified,30,34,35 the full-length channel has never
been crystallized. A low-resolution architecture obtained from single-particle
imaging,36 partial crystal structures of
the CNB domain,37−39 and the pore region of a mimic of CNGA1 channels40,41 is available.

We have used SMFS and a bioinformatics analysis24 to identify F–D curves obtained from the unfolding of single CNGA1 subunits
from their C-terminal expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We identified 126 and 91 F–D curves in the closed and in the open states, respectively.
In these F–D curves, the
distance (D) coincides with the tip-sample separation24 (TSS). The density plots (Figure 1A,1B, respectively)
of these F–D curves show
five and seven main force peaks, above 50 pN, in the closed (Figure 1A) and open states
(Figure 1B), respectively.

of CNGA1 channels in the closed (126 curves) and open states (91 curves),
respectively. (C) Histogram of the values of Lc obtained by fitting F–D curves with the WLC model in
the closed state; force peaks with a value of Lc equal to 17 ±
2.4 (n = 63), 35 ± 3.6 (n =
63), 54 ± 2.8 (n = 104), 80 ± 4.8 (n = 36), 96 ± 3.6 (n = 94), and 116
± 5.6 nm (n = 114) occurred with a probability
of 0.50, 0.50, 0.82, 0.28, 0.74, and 0.90, respectively, and they
are associated with the unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain. Force
peaks with a value of Lc of 159 ± 5.6 (n = 126),
189 ± 6.4 (n = 126), and 234 ± 6.8 nm (n = 114) corresponding to the unfolding of the transmembrane
domain occurred with a probability close to 1. (D) As in (C) but in
the open state; force peaks with a value of Lc of 54 ± 3.2 (n = 44), 84 ± 4.0 (n = 69), 96 ±
2.4 (n = 19), and 116 ± 4.4 nm (n = 88) occurred with a probability of 0.48, 0.75, 0.31, and 0.96,
respectively, and force peaks with a value of Lc of 144 ± 5.2
(n = 88), 174 ± 4.8 (n = 89),
189 ± 7.2 (n = 89), and 234 ± 5.6 nm (n = 83) occurred with a probability close to 1. In (C) and
(D), the number above each peak indicates the value of Lc and its
probability (P). Only forces larger above 35 pN were
considered. (E) Mapping of F–D curves into the (Lc, ΔLc) plane in the closed (red points)
and in the open states (blue points). In each F–D curve, the sequence of force peaks (F1, F2, ..., Fi, ..., Fn) and the corresponding sequence of the values of Lc (Lc1, Lc2, ..., Lci, ..., Lcn) are identified; each F–D curve is mapped in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane into the
set of n points (Lci,
ΔLci = Lci – Lci–1) i = 1, ..., n. See Method for further details. (F) Comparison of the variance (var) of ΔLc
for closed (in red) and open (in blue) states using a bin width of
5 nm.

A closer inspection of F–D curves allows the detection
of additional force peaks not present
in all F–D curves and appearing
with a force below 50 pN. In the closed state (Figure 1C), five force peaks with a value of Lc less
than 100 nm were seen with forces between 35 and 50 pN. All of these
force peaks have a probability (P) lower than 1.
We identified four force peaks with a value of Lc higher than 100
nm and P close to 1 that appeared in almost all F–D curves. These force peaks were
followed by the detachment occurring with a value of Lc varying from
230 to 280 nm.

In the open state (Figure 1D), force peaks had larger amplitudes between
50 and 100 pN,
and three force peaks with a value of Lc lower than 100 nm were detected
with a value of P below 1. In the open state, five
force peaks were present during the unfolding of the transmembrane
domain and occurred with a value of P close to 1
(Figure 1B,D). The
detachment, however, occurred with a larger variability than that
observed in the closed state. To restrict our heterogeneity study
to those F–D curves, which
were confirmed a complete unfolding of a single CNGA1 subunit (from
its C-terminal), we have based
our analysis on F–D curves,
which were obtained following the procedure, as described in our previous
study.24

As the location of force
peaks in F–D curves is a
key feature, we found it convenient to map
each F–D curve in a set of
points in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane (see red and blue points for the
closed and open states, respectively, in Figure 1E). This mapping allows visualizing the variability
of the location of force peaks (Lc) and of the corresponding increase
in Lc (ΔLc) from the previous force peak (see Method for further details). This mapping shows dispersed
points for values of Lc below 116 nm and accumulation of points for
values of Lc between 120 and 250 nm. Force peaks with values of Lc
below 116 nm correspond to the unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain
and those with values of Lc between 120 and 250 nm correspond to the
unfolding of the transmembrane domain.24 The accumulation of points in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane in restricted
regions, for values of Lc between 120 and 250 nm, occurs because force
peaks during the unfolding of the transmembrane domain have a value
of P close to 1 (see Figure 1C,D). As a consequence, the variance of ΔLc
(see red and blue traces in Figure 1F) is large for values of Lc below 116 nm and becomes
low from 120 to 250 nm both in the closed and open states. In the
open state, however, the variance of ΔLc is significantly higher
beyond 250 nm.

In the density plots of Figure 1A,B, F–D curves
were aligned and individual F–D curves were displaced by not more than 5 nm. This displacement,
however, affects the exact determination of the value of Lc, but much
less the value of ΔLc. Therefore, we focused the investigation
of the unfolding variability on the force peaks with a value of P less than 1 and on the analysis of the distribution of
the values of ΔLc.

Unfolding Variability of the Cytoplasmic
Domain
As
shown in Figure 1,
force peaks with values of Lc below 116 nm occur with values of P lower than 1 and appear only in some F–D curves (Figure 1C,D). Using the clustering procedure #124 (see also Method), we
found several clusters of F–D curves with a similar pattern during the unfolding of the cytoplasmic
domain.

In the closed state, we found five major clusters (Figure 2A–E). The
most frequent cluster 1-CS has four force peaks below 116 nm with
an amplitude between 20 and 30 pN at 17 ± 2.4, 35 ± 2.4,
and 54 ± 4.0 nm (n = 64) and with an amplitude
around 40 ± 15 pN at 96 ± 4.0 nm (n = 64).
Clusters 2-CS and 3-CS have a lower number of force peaks (Figure 2B,C) with values
of Lc below 116 nm. Cluster 4-CS has a single force peak with a value
of Lc of 116 ± 4.0 nm (Figure 2D, n = 11), whereas cluster 5-CS has
a single force peak with a value of Lc of 96 ± 3.2 nm (Figure 2E, n = 9). In the open state, we found four major clusters with a lower
number of force peaks and different values of P (Figure 2F–I): force
peaks with values of Lc below 50 nm were not observed, in contrast
with what often seen in the closed state (see Figure 2A). In cluster 1-OS, there are three force
peaks with an Lc equal to 54 ± 3.2, 84 ± 3.6, and 116 ±
4.8 nm (n = 38). Cluster 2-OS has two force peaks
with an Lc of 84 ± 3.2 and 116 ± 3.6 nm (n = 30), whereas clusters 3-OS and 4-OS have only one force peak with
an Lc of 116 ± 4.0 nm (n = 20) and 96 ±
3.4 nm (n = 5), respectively.

of the values of ΔLc for each F–D curve. (F) Density plot of F–D curves from CNGA1 channels in the open state for cluster
1-OS (open state here named OS), with an occurrence of 41% and force

4.8 nm (n = 38). (G) Density plot for cluster 2-OS
with an occurrence of 32% and force peaks with values of Lc of 84
± 3.2 and 116 ± 3.6 nm (n = 30). (H) Density

peak with a value of Lc of 116 ± 4.0 nm (n =

only a force peak with a value of Lc of 96 ± 3.4 nm (n = 5). (J) Histogram of the sum of values of ΔLc
of all of the F–D curves
up to 116 nm (i.e., unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain) in the open
(blue) and closed (red) states. In all of the panels, solid black
curves represent the fitting with the WLC model and the number indicates
the corresponding value of Lc. In all of the density plots, the scale
bar is as in Figure 1 and in all ΔLc, histogram bin = 2 nm. Here, we used procedure
#1 for clustering as described in the Method section.

The histograms of the values of
ΔLc for clusters 1–4
in the closed state and for clusters 1–3 in the open state
have multiple peaks (see insets in the corresponding panels), but
the sum of ΔLc (∑ΔLc) has a Gaussian distribution
with only one peak both for the closed and open states (Figure 2J). This behavior is similar
to that observed during the unfolding of the T4 lisozyme and the leucine
binding protein,22,23 for which the sum of ΔLc
has a Gaussian distribution with only one peak. The unfolding of F–D curves belonging to clusters
5-CS and 4-OS follows a different mechanism, in which a large portion
of the cytoplasmic domain is unfolded in a single step but another
portion of it unfolds concomitantly to the unfolding of the transmembrane
domain.

Unfolding Variability of the Transmembrane Domain
Both
in the closed and open states, the force peaks with an Lc between
116 and 234 nm, corresponding to the unfolding of the transmembrane
domain, have a probability between 0.9 and 1 (Figure 1). In the closed state, points in the (Lc,
ΔLc) plane accumulate around values of Lc of 159, 189, and 234
nm, and we analyzed in detail the points in the rectangular boxes
(see Figure 3A,D,G).
The histogram of the values of Lc of points in these boxes had Gaussian
distribution in agreement with what is seen in Figure 1C. Rather unexpectedly, however, the histogram
of the values of ΔLc corresponding to the increase in Lc between
two successive force peaks was not Gaussian-distributed but had multiple
peaks: in the closed state, the histogram of ΔLc between the
force peaks at about 116 and 159 nm (Figure 3B) had five peaks and the histograms of ΔLc
between the force peaks at about 159 and 189 nm (Figure 3E) and at about 189 and 234
nm (Figure 3H) had
three peaks. Using procedure #2 (see Method and Figure S1), points in the (Lc, ΔLc)
plane were clustered (see colors in Figure 3A,D,G) according to the peaks found in the
histogram of ΔLc values. When F–D curves were aligned so as to have a common force peak
at 159 nm (Figure 3C), 189 nm (Figure 3F), and 234 nm (Figure 3K), the successive force peaks appeared at distinct values of ΔLc
in agreement with what is seen in Figure 3B,E,H. Similar results were obtained also
for the open state (see Figure S2).

Figure 3 Variability
of ΔLc for the transmembrane domain in the closed
state. (A) Mapping of F–D curves into the (Lc, ΔLc) plane in the closed state where
values of ΔLc associated with Lc around 159 nm, within the rectangular
box, were analyzed. (B) Histogram of the values of ΔLc in the
rectangular box of panel a. The histogram has five peaks that were
identified with a different color, which was also used to identify
the corresponding points within the rectangular box of a. As each F–D curve corresponds to a set of
distinct values in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane, the color used within
the rectangular box to label an F–D curve with a given value of ΔLc is used to for all
points corresponding to that F–D curve. (C) Examples of F–D curves corresponding to the blue, green, and red points in b aligned
so as to have a coincident force peak with an Lc of 116 nm. (D) and
(E) as in (A) and (B), but for values of ΔLc associated with
Lc around 189 nm. (F) as in (C) but F–D curves aligned to a common force peak with an Lc of 159
nm. (G) and (H) as in (A) and (B), but for values of ΔLc associated
with Lc around 234 nm. (I) as in (C) but F–D curves aligned to a common force peak with an Lc of 189
nm. In (A), (D), and (G), procedure #2 for clustering is used (see Method and also Figure S1).

Peaks of ΔLc varied from
approximately 25 to 65 nm and assuming
that the length of a single a.a. is 0.4, the number of a.a. unfolded
between two successive force peaks varied from about 60 to 150. This
large variability indicates a high structural heterogeneity of the
transmembrane α-helices S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6, which are
significantly larger than that suggested by the molecular structure
of voltage-gated ionic channels, such as K+ and Na+ channels, obtained from crystallization and X-ray diffraction.1,2 To verify whether the presence of multiple peaks in the distribution
of the values of ΔLc was caused by some artifacts in our recoding
system and not by a genuine structural heterogeneity of CNGA1 channels,
we performed SMFS experiments on a chain of polypeptides formed by
eight repetitions of the I27 modules, anchored to a gold surface by
an cysteine positioned at the start of the polypeptide (Figure 4A). The chain is fused with
six histidine tag (His-tag) to bind specifically to a gold-coated
tip, functionalized with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)–Ni2+, which provides sufficient anchoring force to unfold a structurally
stable I27 module with a mechanical stability of force of ∼180
pN.21 The I27 module is properly folded,
and no significant structural heterogeneity is expected.21 From these experiments, we obtained 58 F–D curves (Figure 4B) with force peaks with an amplitude of
about 180 pN with a mean ΔLc value of approximately 28 nm, a
well-known signature of the unfolding of the I27 module. From these F–D curves, we obtained the values
of (Lc, ΔLc) in the corresponding plane (lower portion of Figure 4C), and we computed
the distribution of the values of ΔLc within the four boxes
shown in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane. As shown in Figure 4C (upper portion), the histograms of the
values of ΔLc have a single peak, different from that shown
in Figure 3. These
control experiments were performed in the same manner as during the
unfolding of CNGA1 channels.

Electrophysiological Validation
of the Structural Variability
After the overexpression of
CNGA1 channels in the plasma membrane
of Xenopus laevis oocytes and using
the excised patch technique and electrical measurements, it is possible
to analyze the properties of wild-type and mutant channels where specific
amino acids are mutated, one by one, in cysteine. These experiments
provide in most cases highly reproducible results but for some mutant
channels, we observed a significant variability, which indicates the
existence of structural heterogeneity. We have analyzed electrophysiological
experiments performed in our laboratory in the last 2 decades in search
of an independent validation of the structural heterogeneity suggested
by SMFS experiments. We have performed several cysteine scanning mutagenesis
(CSM) in different regions of CNGA1 channels. In CSM experiments,
a residue is mutated into a cysteine and the effect of sulfhydryl
reagents, such as Cd2+, copper phenantroline (CuP), and
2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), is
analyzed. Cd2+ ions usually coordinate to two sulfur (S)
atoms,42,43 and CuP44,45 promotes the
formation of disulfide bonds, and their effects are mediated and therefore
reveal the closeness of two S atoms.46,47 MTSET binds
to a single S atom, and its effect reveals the accessibility of mutated
residues.46,47

In the cytoplasmic domain, we performed
a CSM from D588 to N610. In the closed state, Cd2+ and
CuP blocked the great majority of these cysteine mutants, whereas
MTSET blocked only some of the mutant channels33 (Figure S3). In the open state,
a similar diffuse blockage was not observed. These results strongly
indicate that channel blockage occurs when one exogenous S atom from
one subunit of these mutant channels enters in close proximity (less
than 14 Å) to the homologous S atom of another subunit or an
endogenous S atom, possibly belonging to C481 or C505 or C573. As
originally proposed,33 these electrophysiological
experiments indicate that in the closed state, residues from D588
to L607 are parts of highly mobile chains of a.a. so that exogenous
cysteines become in close proximity to either other exogenous or endogenous
cysteines and provide an independent and complementary validation
of the structural heterogeneity suggested by SMFS data (Figure 2). In the open state, in contrast,
a similar diffuse blockage is not observed33 (Figure S3), suggesting a lower structural
heterogeneity in the presence of cGMP, in agreement with the disappearance
of force peaks with values of Lc lower than 50 nm (see Figure 2F–H).

Measurements
of the single-channel conductance
of the blocking effect of divalent cations (such as Ca2+ and Mg2+) and of the effect of temperature have always
provided highly reproducible results but in CSM experiments when some
specific residues were mutated into a cysteine, we observed a consistent
variability in the outcome of electrophysiological experiments.

The highest variability in the plot of (Lc, ΔLc) is observed
at TSS around 100 nm, corresponding to the interface between the cytoplasmic
domain and the intracellular side of S6 (Figures 1F and 3) and therefore
we performed a CSM in this region. If mutated residues of neighboring
subunits are close, then disulfide bonds will form and the closure
of the channel is expected: under these circumstances, a rundown of
the cGMP-activated current will be observed also in the absence of
sulfhydryl reagents. Therefore, we looked to the occurrence of the
rundown of the cGMP-activated current in membrane patches from mutant
channels V391C, G395C, and S399C (Figure 5). Mutant channels V391C and G395C consistently
and in all experiments did not exhibit any rundown (Figure 5A,B) over a period between
5 and 15 min. In mutant channel S399C, in contrast, both in the closed
(Figure 5C) and open
(Figure 5D) states,
highly variable results were observed. In some experiments, an almost
complete rundown was observed within 180 s, revealing the closeness
of the exogenous cysteines, whereas in other experiments, very little
rundown was observed because the exogenous cysteines could not form
disulfide bonds. Similar to that observed with mutant channels V391C
and G395C, we did not observe any rundown either in mutant channel
A406C or Q409C (Figure 5E,F). We performed a CSM also in the pore region from R345C to S371C,
and we did not observe any rundown in these mutant channels with the
exception of the mutant channel I361C. In this mutant channel, the
rundown was complete within 60 s and was highly reproducible,48 indicating that in this mutant channel the exogenous
cysteines are invariably at a close distance.

Inspection of the available molecular
structures of members of
the family of voltage-gated ion channels offers a possible explanation
for the variable rundown of mutant channel S399C: in the chimera Kv2.1–Kv1.2,32,51,52 the S6 domain bends toward outside
the pore axis and becomes connected to the C-linker and if the CNGA1
channel adopts a similar conformation, then residues S399 in neighboring
subunits are at a distance larger than 14 Å and no disulfide
bonds can be formed in mutant channel S399C (Figure 5G,H). In contrast, if the S6 α-helix
adopts an orientation reminiscent of closed K channels,49,50 then residues S399 can become in proximity so that in mutant channel
S399C disulfide bonds are formed (Figure 5J).51

Over
the years, we mutated into a cysteine more than 130 residues
of CNGA1 channels and in almost all mutant channels the effect of
MTSET was highly reproducible.33,48,51−53 However, we observed some variability when residues
near the cytoplasmic end of S4 were mutated into cysteines. In some
patches, exposure to MTSET in the closed state did not produce any
detectable change in cGMP-activated current both in mutant channels
T290C and F282C (see Figure S4), whereas
in other patches, MTSET produced a detectable potentiation at negative
voltages and a concomitant reduction of the voltage rectification
seen before exposure to MTSET. A similar variability was observed
when MTSET was added in the open state. These results suggest that
the exogenous cysteines in positions 282 and 290 have a variable accessibility
from the intracellular side, supporting the notion of the existence
of different native conformations of CNGA1 channels. We propose that
when MTSET is attached to these exogenous cysteines, fluctuations
of the motion of the voltage sensor S4 are reduced, leading to a reduction
of the mild voltage rectification observed under control conditions.

The results of these electrophysiological experiments (Figures S3 and S4) provide a confirmation that
the variability observed in SMFS experiments is caused by a significant
structural heterogeneity of CNGA1 channels and that different configurations
could vary in some cases up to 10 Å and even more (Figure 5C,F).

Variability of Detachment
In the closed state, approximately
12% of the F–D curves show
detachment corresponding to a value of Lc equal to 247 ± 5.6
nm (Figure 6A, n = 15). Both the C- and N-terminals of CNGA1 channels are
intracellular so that when the C-terminal is pulled the detachment
is expected to occur at the beginning of S1 because there is no anchoring
force at the N-terminal. However, the remaining 88% F–D curves show an additional force peak at
around 274 ± 7.2 nm (Figure 6B, n = 111), which corresponds approximately
to the full length of the channel (690 a.a.), suggesting that the
N-terminal is not free but it is anchored to some other structure.
Short and longer F–D curves
are very similar, but not entirely: indeed, short traces have clear
force peaks with a value of Lc about 54 ± 2.0 (n = 14) and 84 ± 2.4 nm (n = 12) with P equal to 0.93 and 0.79, respectively, whereas longer F–D curves do not have force peaks
around 54 and 84 nm but were displaced at 35 ± 6.9 nm (n = 46, P = 0.41) and 96 ± 3.5 nm
(n = 82, P = 0.74).

in the closed state ending with a force peak with a value of Lc around
247 ± 5.6 (n = 15) and 274 ± 7.2 nm (n = 111), respectively (point 1 unit). F–D curves in (A) have the detachment coinciding
with the unfolding of the last transmembrane segment S1, whereas for
those in (B), detachment occurs with an extra peak. F–D curves in (A) have initial force peaks
with a value of Lc of 54 ± 2.0 (n = 14) and
84 ± 2.4 nm (n = 12) (see red stars), not present
in F–D curves in (B). Clusters
in (A) and (B) occurred with an occurrence of 12 and 88%. (C, D) Density
plots of F–D curves from
the unfolding CNGA1 channels in the open state ending with a force
peak with a value of Lc of 234 ± 2.8 nm (n =
72) and larger than 300 nm, respectively (point size 1 unit in (E)
and 1.5 unit in (G)). F–D curves in (C) have the detachment coinciding with the unfolding
of the last transmembrane segment S1, whereas for those in (D), detachment
occurs with a large value of Lc. Almost 50% of F–D curves in (C) have a force peak with a value of Lc of
54 ± 3.2 nm (n = 40, see blue star), not present
in F–D curves in (D). Clusters
in (C) and (D) occurred with an occurrence of 79 and 21%, respectively.
The insets in panels (A)–(D) represent the sum of the values
of ΔLc for each F–D curve. In all density plots, the scale bar is as in Figure 1.

In the open state, some of the F–D curves had final detachment, with a value of Lc about
234 ± 2.8 nm (Figure 6C, n = 72), similar to that observed in the
closed state and with P = 0.79, but other F–D curves were significantly longer
(Figure 6D). In these F–D curves, force peaks appeared
replicated, as obtained from the unfolding of not a single CNGA1 subunit,
but from the concatenation of two subunits. Indeed, in the open state,
the N-terminal of one subunit strongly interacts with the C-terminal
of a neighboring subunit54,55 so that two neighboring
subunits are almost linked together: under these conditions, when
the cantilever tip unfolds one CNGA1 subunit, an additional subunit
can subsequently be unfolded. In the open state, shorter F–D curves have a force peak with Lc around
54 ± 3.2 nm (n = 13) with P = 0.55. This force is not observed in longer F–D curves, suggesting that, similar to that observed in the
closed state, when the unfolding of the CNGA1 channel requires a force
peak with a value of Lc around 54 ± 3.2 nm (n = 13), its C-terminal is less prone to interaction with the N-terminal
of a neighboring subunit. This possibility is also supported by the
observation that F–D curves
obtained from the CNGA1–CNGA1 tandem construct do not show
force peaks with values of Lc around 54 nm.24 Therefore, our results indicate a possible moderate interaction
between the N- and C-terminals in the closed state, potentiated in
the open state where the N-terminal can either be free or interacting
with neighboring subunits.

We have also computed the sum of
ΔLc corresponding to the
unfolding of the transmembrane domain (∑ TMΔLc)
corresponding to portions of the F–D curves between the force peak at about 116 nm and that
at about 234 nm,24 and we analyzed its
variability. For short F–D curves (Figure 6A),
in the closed state, the value of ∑ TMΔLc
has only one peak with a value of about 130 nm with a Gaussian distribution
(inset Figure 6A),
whereas for longer F–D curves
(Figure 6B), the distribution
of ∑ TMΔLc had three peaks at 108, 115, and
128 nm (inset Figure 6B). The number of force peaks in the distribution of ∑ TMΔLc is linked to the presence of specific force peaks
during the unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain. Indeed, in the closed
state, if during the unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain there are
force peaks with a value of Lc at 54 ± 2.0 and 84 ± 2.4
nm (n = 72), then detachment occurs at about 247
nm, suggesting that in this case the C-terminal of CNGA1 channels
is almost free. In contrast, if detachment occurs at about 274 nm,
then the value of ∑ TMΔLc has multiple peaks.
We have also computed ∑ TMΔLc for F–D curves obtained in the open
state in contrast to that seen in the closed state; shorter F–D curves had three peaks at 118,
125, and 134 nm (compare insets of Figure 6A,C), whereas longer F–D curves had only one peak at 128 nm (inset Figure 6D).

We have also observed
a significant coupling between the unfolding
of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains especially in the closed
state (see Figure S5) and at a lower extent
in the open state (see Figure S6)

Unfolding
at Different Speeds
When the pulling speed
is 500 nm/s, the cytoplasmic domain unfolds with a variable number
of force peaks, whereas the transmembrane domain unfolds with an almost
fixed number of force peaks but with highly different values of ΔLc.
It is possible, however, that this unfolding pattern was caused by
the used pulling speed and does not represent a distinct feature of
the unfolding of CNGA1 subunit and a signature of its structural heterogeneity.
Therefore, we compared F–D curves obtained from the unfolding of CNGA1 subunits at pulling
speeds from 200 to 1500 nm/s. As expected from previous investigations,13,56 a large force was necessary to unfold CNGA1 when the pulling speed
was increased (Figure 7) but the value of Lc corresponding to the observed force peaks did
not change their mean value. At a slower pulling speed of 200 nm/s,
the force necessary to unfold CNGA1 channels was often lower than
50 pN (Figure 7A),
and the force peaks observed during the unfolding of the TM domain
had a probability larger than 0.9, but a higher variability was observed
during the unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain. Similar results were
obtained at the pulling speed of 1000 nm/s (Figure 7C) and 1500 nm/s (Figure 7D). The unfolding force of a protein depends
on the pulling speed of the cantilever.57,58 According
to the Bell–Evans model, the force of unfolding is proportional
to the logarithm of the pulling speed. Because of our experimental
limitations, we are only able to change the pulling velocity at a
smaller scale, which is why the unfolding force scaled almost linearly
with the pulling speed (Figure 7E,F).

Discussion
The unfolding of CNGA1
channels expressed in Xenopus
laevis oocytes is highly variable both in the number
of force peaks (Figures 1 and 2) and in the values of ΔLc between
successive force peaks (Figure 3) and follows a specific pattern. This variability is usually
attributed to the existence of multiple native configurations and/or
to its intrinsic stochasticity.22,23 However, electrophysiological
experiments with mutant channels, in which a specific a.a. is mutated
in a cysteine and the spontaneous rundown is observed (Figure 5), combined with additional
electrophysiological results (see Figures S3 and S4), suggest the existence of multiple native configurations
of CNGA1 channels both in the closed and open states. The unfolding
of the cytoplasmic domain occurs with a variable number of force peaks
(Figure 2), up to three
in the open state (Figure 2F–I) and up to four in the closed state (Figure 2A–E). The existence
of more intermediate steps during the unfolding of the cytoplasmic
domain in the closed state is likely to be caused by a larger number
of different conformations with the α-helices of the cyclic
nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) properly folded, partially folded,
or completely unfolded, as exemplified in Figure 8A–C. In the open state, the CNBD is
likely to be more folded and to have a lower number of intermediate
conformations in agreement with the AFM imaging of the cytoplasmic
domain of the MlotiK1 potassium channels, which have a well-defined
tetrameric structure only in the presence of cyclic nucleotides.7 In a different way, the unfolding of the transmembrane
domain occurs with an almost fixed number of force peaks but with
highly variable values of ΔLc (Figures 1 and 3) both in the
closed and open states. Indeed, the number of a.a. unfolded between
two successive force peaks varies from some tens up to 120. This observation
suggests that the α-helices forming the transmembrane domain
preserve their topology of crossing the lipid membrane from the intracellular
to the extracellular side but do not have a fixed configuration. In
this view, the number of properly folded α-helix turns is variable,
and the extracellular and intracellular loops connecting the α-helices
have variable breaking points when stretched, as illustrated in Figure 8D–F where
the number of properly folded turns of the transmembrane α-helices
varies from 6 to 9.

Figure 8 Schematic representation of the structural heterogeneity
of CNGA1;
(A–C) structural heterogeneity of CNB domain; three possible
conformations: with all α-helices properly folded (A), a couple
of α-helices partially unfolded (B), and many α-helices
unfolded (C). (D–F) structural heterogeneity of transmembrane
domain; three possible conformations: with the C-terminal end of S6
and the S4–S5 linker unfolded (D), with S6 properly folded
and with a tight mechanical connection to the C-linker (E) with a
highly rigid S5–S4 linker (F); (G–I) structural heterogeneity
of the N-terminal. Three possible conformations: the N-terminal interacts
with the CNB domain of a neighboring subunit (G), the N-terminal interacts
with a membrane (H), and the N-terminal is free with S1 properly folded
(I).

The folding of α-helices
is due to weak H-bonds and favorable
side-chain interactions so that it is very sensitive to fluctuations
in the local environment and to its degree of crowding and hydrophobicity.59

Also, the detachment following the unfolding
of CNGA1 channels
is highly variable (Figure 6), which can be rationalized by assuming that the N-terminal
is a mobile and dynamic structure, and that in the open state a strong
interaction with a neighboring subunit leads to the unfolding of two
concatenated CNGA1 subunits (Figure 6G). The possible structural heterogeneity of the N-terminal
is illustrated in the schematic of Figure 8G–J.

The existence of multiple
conformations of ion channels is also
supported by a detailed analysis of single-channel activity in which
multiple open and closed states are necessary to explain the distribution
of closed and open times.3 The same conclusion
can be drawn from molecular dynamic simulations of the glutamate receptors,60 of Na+ channels,61 and of K+ channels.62 The existence of multiple conformational states seems to be an emerging
common property in most membrane proteins, such as the β2-adrenergic
receptor.4,5 Multiple conformations can originate not
only from small movements of single a.a. but also from large movements
of entire domains.4,5 Simple thermal fluctuations, fluctuations
in the oxidizing/reducing local environment, and the presence of conformations
corresponding to local minima of the free-energy landscape all contribute
to the structural variability.

Therefore, the obvious question
is: how large are the structural
differences of these conformations and how is it possible to measure
them in a reliable way? The high variability of the spontaneous rundown
of mutant S399C (Figure 5) suggests that structural differences of native conformations could
be up to 10 Å and even larger.

The structural heterogeneity
of CNGA1 channels, described here,
is at the basis of the results of electrophysiological experiments
in which residues in the CNBD were mutated, one by one, to a cysteine
and the effect of thiol reagents was analyzed: as already proposed
some years ago,33 residues from D588 to
L607 in the closed state, but not in the open state, are not part
of a properly folded α-helix but belong to a highly mobile chain
of polypeptides that assumes multiple conformations. As discussed
in the main text, the structural heterogeneity of CNGA1 channels is
also at the origin of the variability of the results of some electrophysiological
experiments (Figures 5, S3, and S4).

CNGA1 channels and
all other CNG channels are poorly selective
and indeed are permeable to all monovalent alkali cations such as
Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and
Cs+.25,63 On the basis of physical considerations
from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics,64 this poor ionic selectivity was attributed to the flexibility
of the pore of CNG channels, that is, to the capacity of the pore
to adopt different configurations depending on which ion is present
inside the pore. This hypothesis was later confirmed by X-ray crystallography,41 in which the structure of the pore walls changed
with the radius of the ion present inside the pore. The
flexibility of the pore, as a consequence of the structural heterogeneity
of CNGA1 channels, is also responsible for the voltage-dependent gating
observed in the presence of large permeant cations, such as Cs+ and dymethylamonium, but not with the small alkali cations
such as Li+, Na+, and K+.25 In this case, when a large permeant cation is
present in the pore, the pore walls expand so that it becomes sensitive
to the motion of the voltage sensor located in S4.

Our results
suggest to consider with caution the fixed and frozen
folding of α-helices of membrane proteins obtained from X-ray
crystallography, which could be produced by the combination of purification
and the molecular forces caused by the strong packing inside diffracting
crystals. When an ion channel is embedded in a natural membrane at
room temperature, the static folding of its α-helices seen in
X-ray crystallography is expected to become dynamic: the high variability
of the values of ΔLc in the transmembrane domain (Figure 3) suggests that turns of transmembrane
α-helices are formed and disrupted almost continuously.

CNGA1 channels, despite many attempts and efforts, have never been
crystallized, and a possible explanation for their resistance to form
well-ordered crystals able to diffract X-rays is their structural
heterogeneity.

Methods
Heterologous Expression
System and Sample Preparation
RNA coding for the CNGA1 subunit
was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes
(“Xenopus express”
Ancienne Ecole de Vernassal, Le Bourg 43270, Vernassal, Haute Loire,
France). Oocytes were prepared as previously described.33 Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C
in a Barth solution supplemented with 50 mg/mL of gentamycin sulfate
and contained (in mM) 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.82 MgSO4, 0.33
Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 2.4 NaHCO3, and 5 Tris–HCl (pH 7.4 buffered with NaOH). All of
the used salts and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). The vitelline membrane of oocytes was removed mechanically.
We performed SMFS in oocytes in which the cGMP-activated current measured
with conventional patch pipettes was larger than 1 nA at ±100
mV.24 These oocytes were incubated and
deposited on a freshly cleaved mica substrate for 5–10 min
in the recording solution (110 mM NaCl, 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, pH 7.4). After this step, we roll out the oocyte from the substrate
leaving the attached piece of membrane on the substrate. The yolk
and granules of the cytoplasm were removed by repetitive washings
with the recording solution. To image the membrane patches, AFM in
liquid and in tapping mode was used.

AFM and Cantilever Functionalization
In this study,
we have used the AFM (NanoWizard 3, JPK) mounted upon an inverted
optical microscope (Olympus IX71). After localizing plasma membrane
patches, we performed SMFS experiments.24 The cantilever spring constant was ∼0.08 N/m and was calibrated
before the start of each experiment by using the equipartition theorem.
A 0.4 NA/10× objective was used to localize the area of oocyte
incubation. AFM images were acquired with a resolution of 512 pixels.
For SMFS experiments, the tip was in contact with the selected membrane
patch for 0.5 s while we applied a force of 1 nN. The surface was
separated at a velocity of 500 nm/s while the force exerted between
the tip and surface was recorded. During an experimental session lasting
up to 8–10 h, approximately 10 000 F–D curves were collected in three or four
different regions of 1 μm2 size. We have performed
similar SMFS experiments also when the pulling speed13,56 was varied from 200 to 1500 nm/s.

Cantilever tips were functionalized
with thiol and NTA–Ni2+. The functionalization was
done in four steps. First, tips were cleaned in ethanol for 15 min,
dried under N2 flow and exposed to ultraviolet light for
15 min. The tips were further incubated for 15 min in chloroform and
dried again under a N2 flow. These three steps were then
repeated to obtain cleaner tips. In the second step, the cleaned cantilevers
were incubated for 30 min in 10 μM dithiobis-C2-NTA (Dojindo
Molecular Technologies, Inc., Japan), washed with ethanol, and dried
in a N2 flow. In the third step, the tips were then incubated
for 20 min in 100 μM NiSO4 and rinsed with MilliQ
water before being dried in a N2 flow. Finally, the functionalized
tips were incubated for 20 min in 10 mM 6-mercapto-1-hexanol to avoid
nonspecific adsorption and were dried under a N2 flow.
Salts and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

SMFS Experiments
and Data Processing
Clean fragments
of oocyte membrane remained anchored to the mica substrate with the
intracellular side exposed to the recording solution and to the cantilever
tip of the AFM were used. After the localization of the membrane patch,
we moved the AFM tip over the imaged area expressing CNGA1 channels.
The CNGA1 concentration on the oocyte membrane depends on the level
of expression of the CNGA1 channel. In electrophysiological experiments
with patch electrodes with a tip of about 1 μm2,
24 h after injection of the mRNA into oocytes, it is possible to have
electrical recordings from a single CNGA1 channel and in this case
we have a very low channel density. After 3–5 days, it is possible
to record currents in the nanoampere range and the number of CNGA1
channels can be 1000–5000 per μm2.24 Moreover, it is known that there are only few
native membrane proteins present in oocytes24,27 and only very few and almost none ionic channels of the family of
voltage-gated channels. These are the conditions in which we performed
our SMFS experiments. In approximately 20% of cases, the tip was able
to absorb a molecule providing a sawtooth-like F–D curve and if the magnitude of force of these F–D curves was larger than 45 pN, the curve
was saved. We performed SMFS and collected approximately
300 000 F–D curves
in the absence of 2 mM cGMP (closed state) and 200 000 F–D curves in the presence of 2
mM cGMP (open state) from noninjected (control) oocytes. We also collected
more than 500 000 F–D curves from oocytes that had been injected with the mRNA of CNGA1
channels in the open and closed states. We applied informatics to
identify F–D curves that
were present in only the SMFS experiments that used injected oocytes.
The method had two steps. First, each F–D curve was mapped in a sequence of symbols that represented
the location and amplitude of the force peaks (coding) and then these
sequences were assembled in groups with similar properties (clustering).
This method has been described in detail previously.24

Clustering of F–D Curves
To obtain and characterize the unfolding
variability, we used two
procedures for clusterization of F–D curves. Procedure #1 was similar to that already developed24 and was used to identify the clusters of F–D curves associated with the unfolding
of the C domain (see Figure 3). In this case, we restricted the analysis to values of TSS
less than 120 nm and we identified four and three clusters for the
closed and open states, respectively. In addition to procedure #1,
we developed an additional procedure, referred as clustering procedure
#2, for clustering of F–D curves on the basis of the mapping of each F–D curve in a set of points in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane
shown in Figure S1. The clustering procedure
#2 is composed of the following steps:1 After the identification of F–D curves obtained from the unfolding
of a single CNGA1 subunit,24 each F–D curve is mapped in the (Lc,
ΔLc) plane in the following way: each force peak Fi (larger than 35 pN) in a F–D curve is fitted with the WLC model20,21 to obtain the corresponding value of Lc. In this way, the sequence
of force peaks (F1, F2, ..., Fi, ...,Fn) is identified in the corresponding
sequence of the values of Lc (Lc1, Lc2, ...,
Lci, ..., Lcn) and each F–D curve is
mapped in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane into a set of n points (Lci, ΔLci = Lci – Lci–1) i = 1, ..., n.

2 Points in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane
appear to accumulate in specific restricted regions as within the
rectangular box of Figure S1B. Clustering
is based on the analysis of the histogram of the values of ΔLc
within these regions. As shown in Figure 1C, the histogram of the values of ΔLc
is not Gaussian-distributed but has three distinct peaks, leading
to three clusters indicated by different colors.

3 From the three clusters seen in Figure 1C, three sets of F–D curves are obtained and are
mapped in the (Lc, ΔLc) plane as points with the same color
(see Figure S1b). From these points, we
can recover the corresponding F–D curves, as shown in Figures S5 and S6.



Ethics Statements
All experiments
performed with Xenopus laevis frogs
in this study were approved
by the International School for Advanced Studies Ethics Committee
according to the Italian and European guidelines for animal care (d.l.
116/92; 86/609/C.E.). Oocytes were harvested from female Xenopus laevis frogs using an aseptic technique or,
if necessary, purchased from Ecocyte Bioscience (Am Förderturm,
44575, Castrop-Rauxel, Germany). All X. laevis surgeries were performed under general anesthesia, induced by immersion
in a 0.2% solution of tricaine methane sulfonate (MS-222) adjusted
to pH 7.4 for 15–20 min. Depth of anesthesia was assessed by
loss of the righting reflex and loss of withdrawal reflex to a toe
pinch. After surgery, animals were singly housed for 48 h. Frogs were
monitored daily for 1 week postoperatively to ensure the absence of
any surgery-related stress.
