Formation of multiple crystalline
phases of a multiblock amphiphilic
macrocycle AT2B is demonstrated. AT2B forms
a single crystal (Cr-α) by vapor diffusion and shows reversible
single-crystal-to-single-crystal transition between two crystalline
phases (Cr-α and Cr-β) by a temperature change, and crystalline AT2B (Cr-β) melts at 422 K, and the cooling rate from
the melt influences the phase of the solid formed. By cooling at 1.0
K min–1, AT2B forms crystalline phases
(Cr-γ and Cr-δ), which are different from both Cr-α
and Cr-β. On the other hand, cooling at 2.0 K min–1 results in the formation of an amorphous phase, and a mechanical
stress also triggers a crystal-to-amorphous solid transition. Interestingly,
the amorphous solid crystallizes to give the fifth crystalline phase
(Cr-γ) upon heating before melting. It is suggested that these
multiple phase transitions are driven by thermal conformational changes
at the tetraethylene glycol chains of AT2B.

Introduction
Polymorphism is a ubiquitous
phenomenon among crystals of organic,
inorganic, and organometallic molecules and polymers.1 Control of the polymorphs is an important subject for pharmaceutical
and materials chemistry because polymorphs influence physical and
chemical properties of the crystal.2−7 For example, chloramphenicol palmitate is known to form two types
of polymorphs, where the bioavailability of each polymorph is different
from one another.8 The luminescent property
of organic dyes is also dependent on polymorphs.2−6 As for the control of polymorphs, many physical and
chemical factors including solvent, temperature, additives, and mechanical
forces can influence the crystallization process so as to afford different
polymorphs. Meanwhile, some molecular crystals exhibit a polymorphic
transition by external stimuli, which are applicable for developing
dynamic and switchable materials.9

In recent years, thermosalient crystals,9,10 which
undergo physical motions triggered by thermal phase transition between
the polymorphs, are also drawing increasing attention. In this research
area, we recently reported a single-crystal-to-single-crystal thermal
polymorphic transition of a multiblock amphiphilic macrocycle AT2B (Figure 1), which is accompanied by a macroscopic bending motion of the needlelike
crystal without breakdown of single crystallinity.11,12 X-ray crystallographic analyses indicated that the temperature elevation
and reduction induces conformational changes at the tetraethylene
glycol (TEG) chains of AT2B, which leads to alteration
of the molecular alignment to trigger the phase transition. The single
crystal has elasticity to allow for the macroscopic bending motion
without collapsing, which is likely due to rather weak intermolecular
interactions without the presence of directional hydrogen-bonding
or ionic groups as well as the flexible conformation of AT2B in the solid state.

Figure 1 Molecular structure of the cyclic multiblock amphiphile AT2B.

Here, as one of the unique
features of AT2B in the
solid state, we report that this compound affords totally five polymorphic
phases. Among them, four of those were formed by careful control of
the heating and cooling processes including thermal phase transitions.
In addition, these thermal phase transitions are likely caused by
thermal conformational changes of the TEG chains of AT2B. In addition to these multiple crystalline phases, an amorphous
phase also appeared by rapid cooling from the molten state or applying
a mechanical stress to the crystalline phase.

Results and Discussion
As reported in our previous paper,11 upon crystallization under a liquid–liquid diffusion condition
between tetrahydrofuran (THF) and n-hexane at 298
K, AT2B afforded a single crystal, whose phase is denoted
as Cr-α. A thermal phase transition occurs at 333 K (Figure 2a, black solid line;
ΔH = 2.4 kJ mol–1, endothermic)
upon heating Cr-α to form Cr-β. This phase transition
is reversible if the crystal is kept under its melting point (Tm = 422 K), where Cr-β returns to Cr-α
at 329 K (ΔH = −3.1 kJ mol–1, exothermic) in the cooling process.

Meanwhile, cooling the
melt of AT2B at the rate of
1.0 K min–1 shows an exothermic transition at 353
K (Figure 2a, blue
solid line; ΔH = −34.0 kJ mol–1) in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, which is assigned
to be the freezing point.11 Below the freezing
point, a broad exothermic transition peak was observed at 314 K (ΔH = −3.2 kJ mol–1). In the subsequent
heating process, an endothermic transition was observed at 328 K (Figure 2a, red solid line;
ΔH = 2.7 kJ mol–1), and these
transitions were reversibly observed in the temperature range between
270 and 360 K (Figure 2, broken lines). Small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS
and WAXS) measurements of AT2B at 330 and 300 K in the
cooling process from 433 K displayed sharp signals with different
patterns from each other (Figure 3a,b). Both of these X-ray scattering profiles are also
different from those of Cr-α or Cr-β, suggesting the emergence
of new polymorphs, Cr-γ (T < 314 K) and
Cr-δ (T = 314–353 K), in the cooling
process. The phase transition between Cr-γ (T < 328 K) and Cr-δ (T = 328–420
K) is reversible, where the transition in the heating process is endothermic.
Polarized optical microscopy (POM) exhibited a streaky pattern at
330 K in the cooling process from the melt (Figure 4a) and further cooling to 300 K caused cracking
(Figure 4b).

the melt at 2.0 K min–1 followed by heating to (d)
373 K.

melt at 2.0 K min–1 followed by heating to (d) 373
K. Scale bars: 50 μm.

By sharp contrast, when the cooling rate from the melt was
increased
to 2.0 K min–1, no clear transition was observed
in the DSC measurement (Figure 2b, blue line) until 250 K. X-ray scattering measurements displayed
only a halo without any clear signals at 323 K after the rapid cooling
(Figure 3c), where
POM exhibited liquidlike curly and random patterns (Figure 4c). Thus, it is suggested that the rapid cooling of molten AT2B results in the formation of an amorphous solid, or more
likely a glassy solid, without crystallization. The glassy solid showed
an exothermic transition at 368 K (ΔH = −38.2
kJ mol–1) below Tm upon
temperature elevation (Figure 2b, red line). POM exhibited a radially oriented pattern at
373 K (Figure 4d),
where X-ray scattering showed sharp signals with different profiles
from those of Cr-α, Cr-β, Cr-γ, or Cr-δ (Figure 3d), thereby suggesting
an emergence of a new crystalline phase (Cr-ε) by crystallization
from the glassy state. As suggested by X-ray scattering measurements
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), the crystalline phase of AT2B also changes to amorphous
by a mechanical stress such as grinding in a mortar, which would cause
defects and increase disorder in crystals.13

It is known that rapid cooling of a polymer in a mobile state
provides
its amorphous or glass state because of the kinetic factors such as
entanglement and restricted motions of macromolecular chains inhibiting
the ordered alignment of the molecules. Once the frozen macromolecular
chains in the glass state acquire the thermal energy for mobility,
they organize into crystals as an exothermic process.14 The characteristic “polymer-like” phase transition
of AT2B observed in the rapid cooling and subsequent
heating processes is likely due to the restricted yet variable conformation
of the TEG chains in the macrocyclic structure.

In the thermal
phase transition between Cr-α and Cr-β,
the TEG chains of AT2B change the conformations.11 The conformational changes at the C–C
and C–O bonds in poly(ethylene glycol) can be visualized by
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.15Figure 5 shows FT-IR spectra of AT2B in Cr-γ, Cr-δ, Cr-ε, and glassy solid phases,
where the vibrational absorption bands corresponding to CH2 twist of gauche C–C and trans C–O (1250 cm–1), CH2 twist of trans C–O (1282 cm–1), CH2 twist of gauche C–O (1300 cm–1 shoulder), and CH2 wag of gauche C–C (1350 cm–1) are displayed in all cases. In the case of the phase
transition between Cr-γ and Cr-δ, these vibrational bands
showed changes in the intensities, indicating that the conformation
around the C–C and C–O single bonds in the TEG chains
changes into those with different rotational C–C and C–O
angles. Likewise, FT-IR spectra of AT2B in Cr-ε
and glassy solid phases showed the changes at these bands during the
phase transition. In this case, the spectra showed a larger change
than the case of Cr-γ/Cr-δ transition, suggesting larger
conformational changes at the TEG chains upon crystallization from
the glassy solid. Thus, FT-IR spectroscopic studies suggest that the
conformational changes of the TEG chains occur during these polymorphic
transitions. In other words, the conformational thermo-responsiveness
at the TEG chains likely contributes to the diversity of polymorphs
and prompts the polymorphic thermal phase transitions. The UV–vis
absorption spectroscopic measurements of AT2B also showed
differences in the spectral profiles between Cr-γ and Cr-δ
and Cr-ε and glassy solid phases. This suggests that the geometry
of the packing of the aromatic units as well as their conformation
is also different among these polymorphic phases (Figure 6).

K min–1 followed by heating to 373 K (black).

process from the melt at 2.0 K min–1 followed by
heating to 373 K (black).

The solid-state phases and their phase transition processes
of AT2B are summarized in Table 1. Recrystallization by vapor diffusion from
a THF and n-hexane mixture affords Cr-α, which
undergoes transition
to Cr-β at 333 K. This thermal phase transition is reversible,
and the single crystal retains the crystallinity during the heating/cooling
processes. Furthermore, heating above 422 K results in a phase transition
to give a melt. Here, cooling rate from the melt influences the phase
formed in the solid state. Namely, by cooling at 1.0 K min–1, AT2B crystallizes into Cr-δ, which changes into
Cr-γ upon further cooling. The thermal phase transition between
Cr-δ and Cr-γ phases is reversible. Meanwhile, cooling
at 2.0 K min–1 results in the formation of the glassy
solid phase. Upon heating, AT2B in the glassy solid phase
crystallizes in the Cr-ε phase at 368 K and melts at 416 K.

Conclusions
Formation
of multiple polymorphs of cyclic multiblock amphiphile AT2B was demonstrated. In addition to the already found two
phases which could be formed by crystallization from solution followed
by heating, four additional solid phases including a glassy solid
phase were found. By controlling the cooling rate from the melt, AT2B affords different solid phases. Cooling with a slow rate
(1.0 K min–1) allows for the formation of crystalline
phases (Cr-γ and Cr-δ), whereas cooling with a fast rate
(2.0 K min–1) results in the formation of a glassy
solid phase. The glassy solid phase changes into Cr-γ by heating
before melting. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the conformational
changes at the TEG chains in AT2B trigger the polymorphic
transition. It is also suggested that the geometry and/or packing
of the aromatic units of AT2B alters in the thermal phase
transitions. Hence, the molecular design including oligo(ethylene
glycol) chains in a macrocycle is an effective approach to develop
thermoresponsive polymorphic crystalline materials, which exhibit
characteristic phase-transition behaviors including amorphous solid
or glassy solid and crystalline phases. This would be advantageous
for fabrication of dynamic materials with switchable and memorizable
functions.
