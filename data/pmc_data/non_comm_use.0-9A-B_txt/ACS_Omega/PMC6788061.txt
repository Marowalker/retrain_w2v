The
key of spintronic devices using the spin-transfer torque phenomenon
is the effective reduction of switching current density by lowering
the damping constant and the saturation magnetization while retaining
strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. To reduce the saturation
magnetization, particular conditions such as specific substitutions
or buffer layers are required. Herein, we demonstrate highly reduced
saturation magnetization in tetragonal D022 Mn3–xGa thin films prepared by
rf magnetron sputtering, where the epitaxial growth is examined on
various substrates without any buffer layer. As the lattice mismatch
between the sample and the substrate decreases from LaAlO3 and (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 to SrTiO3, the quality of Mn3–xGa films is improved together with the magnetic and
electronic properties. Especially, the Mn3–xGa thin film epitaxially grown on the SrTiO3 substrate,
fully oriented along the c axis perpendicular to
the film plane, exhibits significantly reduced saturation magnetization
as low as 0.06 μB, compared to previous results.
By the structural and chemical analyses, we find that the predominant
removal of Mn II atoms and the large population of Mn3+ ions affect the reduced saturation magnetization. Our findings provide
insights into the magnetic properties of Mn3–xGa crystals, which promise great potential for spin-related
device applications.

1 Introduction
Spintronics
has received intensive interest because of further
degree of freedom by spin transport, leading to efficient applications
in information storage and processing.1,2 To realize
the elaborate spintronic devices, low damping constant, small saturation
magnetization, large spin polarization, and strong perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA) are requisitely demanded.3−6 Recent progressive achievements
have highlighted to generate the spin-polarized current, particularly
in spin-transfer-torque (STT) memory devices.7,8 The
reduction of switching current density based on the STT phenomenon
has garnered attention in magnetic-tunnel-junction (MTJ) technologies.9 Mn2-based Heusler compounds are exploited
as promising magnetic components in MTJ devices, which possess low
saturation magnetization, strong PMA, and high Curie temperature.10,11 Mn3Ga exhibits a variety of magnetic properties, which
strongly depend on the crystal structure.12−16 The hexagonal D019 phase
in equilibrium is antiferromagnetic with noncollinear triangular magnetic
structure, demonstrating remarkable exchange bias effect due to frustrated
magnetic structure.12,13,17 The metastable cubic L21 phase is discussed
as an antiferromagnetic half-metal,3 which
is experimentally observed with zero net magnetization.14,18 When the cubic structure is distorted along the c direction, one obtains the tetragonal D022 phase, which is ferrimagnetic with two inequivalent positions and
magnetic moments of Mn atoms.15,16,18−22 As shown in Figure 1a, one Mn I and two Mn II sublattices occupy the 2b (0, 0, 1/2) and
4d (0, 1/2, 1/4) positions, respectively, and the Ga atom is at the
2a (0, 0, 0) position.19,23 From neutron experiments, the
Mn I atoms at 2b with a magnetic moment of −3.07 μB are ferromagnetically aligned along the c axis, and antiferromagnetically coupled with Mn II atoms at 4d with
2.08 μB, leading to a ferrimagnetic state with a
net moment of 1.09 μB.18 Thus, the magnetization is strictly governed by the number of Mn
I and Mn II atoms as well as the magnetic coupling between Mn atoms.

Figure 1 (a) Crystal
and magnetic structure of Mn3Ga and (b)
XRD patterns of Mn3–xGa films deposited
on STO, LSAT, LAO substrates, where the substrate peaks are indicated
by circle, triangle, and diamond symbols, respectively. The y-scale is plotted in logarithmic scale.

In experiment, this material is usually present in a lack
of Mn
form, that is Mn3–xGa, where the
saturation magnetization, MS is enhanced
with the Mn vacancy, x. Here, the mostly accepted
picture is that Mn I deficiency increases the magnetization, whereas
Mn II deficiency decreases the magnetization. Thus, the increased MS is believed to be because of the removal of
Mn I because the removal of Mn I weakens the hybridization between
Mn I and Ga along the c axis and elongates the c-axis lattice parameter.23−25 Such increased MS can be an impediment to reduce the switching
current density in spintronic device applications using the STT phenomenon.
Recently, the substitution of transition metals (Tr = Fe, Co, Ni,
and Cu) in Mn3–xTrxGa has been extensively studied as one way to effectively
reduce the magnetization,26−30 but often leading to incomplete PMA properties.30,31 In an ordered manner, the transition metal element is considered
to occupy the Mn II site at the 4d position. This result is compared
to the easy removal of Mn I in Mn3–xGa. On the other hand, some theoretical studies have proposed that
the total magnetic moment can decrease with the lack of Mn because
of possible removal of Mn II instead of Mn I.23,30,31 However, there has been no experimental
result on the decrease of MS by the removal
of Mn II in Mn3–xGa.

In order
to overcome the lattice mismatch at the interface and
obtain the epitaxial thin films of Mn3–xGa, various substrates and numerous buffer layers have been
used.4,32−35 Most films are grown with the
easy magnetization pointing along the tetragonal c axis, which is perpendicular to the film plane. There have been
some reports asserting the successful growth of epitaxial Mn3–xGa thin films.16,34,35 Nevertheless, there has been observed a small kink structure around
zero field in the magnetic hysteresis, which is ascribed to a small
fraction of c-axis-oriented magnetic components in
the film plane.33 Furthermore, experiments
have provided a variety of MS values ranging
from 0.3 to 1.6 μB,32,36 which depend
on the substrates and buffer layers. Here is a challenging issue as
to how the magnetic properties are evolved by improving the quality
of epitaxial films.

Holding this kind of issues on which the
Mn site is easily removed
and substituted in different ways, herein, we have chosen a fairly
Mn-deficient Mn3Ga with the D022 tetragonal structure for obtaining epitaxial thin films. We report
a highly reduced MS in Mn3–xGa thin films, directly grown on various substrates
of SrTiO3 (STO), (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2AlTaO3)0.7 (LSAT), and LaAlO3 (LAO) without any buffer layer. Although all the samples exhibit
low MS, compared to previously reported
values, the Mn3–xGa film that epitaxially
grows on the STO substrate shows the lowest MS, where the lattice mismatch between the sample and the substrate
is the smallest among the growth substrates. Reducing the lattice
mismatch from LAO and LSAT to STO improves the film quality, which
is evident in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) results. The magnetic and electronic properties are
also dependent on the growth substrates. Especially, in the Mn3–xGa film epitaxially grown on the
STO substrate, MS reaches about 10 emu/cm3 (=0.06 μB), which is one order lower than
the previous results.32,36 From the analyses of crystal
structure and chemical state of Mn3–xGa thin films, the most possible origins for the low MS in Mn3–xGa are discussed with the predominant removal of Mn II atoms and
the large population of Mn3+ ions. This result has a good
advantage for spin-related applications such as reducing the critical
current density of the STT-based devices.

2 Results
and Discussion
The chemical composition has been analyzed
by the scanning electron
microscopy–energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM–EDS)
measurements, giving rise to the composition of roughly Mn/Ga = 2.2:1
for all the films deposited on different substrates of STO, LSAT,
and LAO, although we used a single target of Mn3Ga. This
demonstrates clear Mn deficiencies from the stoichiometric Mn3Ga phase, that is denoted as Mn3–xGa. The structural changes of Mn3–xGa films depending on the substrates of STO, LSAT, and LAO
have been investigated by XRD analyses. In Figure 1b, the sample on STO displays the tetragonal D022 structure (space group I4/mmm) labeled with the c-axis indices of (002) and (004), which are perpendicular to the
film plane. The c-axis lattice parameter is estimated
to be 7.17 Å, which is the same value reported by other literatures
on the tetragonal Mn3Ga phase.16,18,23 For the LSAT substrate, the (004) diffraction
peak exhibits a broad shoulder around 2θ = 51°, reflecting
the presence of a small misalignment from the c axis.
The evaluated c-axis lattice parameter from the main
(004) peak is slightly larger, c = 7.33 Å, as
indicated in Table 1. The lattice parameter expansion along the c axis
may be attributed to the reduction in the a-axis
lattice parameter of the substrate to keep the mass density constant.
For films grown on the LAO substrate, only peaks from the substrate
are observed, although the existence of Mn and Ga elements was confirmed
in the SEM–EDS results.

More specific crystal structure
of the Mn3–xGa samples can be clarified
through high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) measurements. Figure 2 shows the representative cross-sectional HRTEM images
and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of Mn3–xGa films deposited on STO, LSAT, and LAO substrates.
All the samples display sharp interfaces within 1 nm. In Figure 2a, the crystal lattice
of the Mn3–xGa film on the STO
substrate is characterized to be indexed to the D022 structure, being consistent with the XRD result. The
FFT plot for the STO substrate shows only the diffraction peaks corresponding
to (200) and (004) orientations, parallel and perpendicular to the
film plane, respectively. The well-oriented lattice fringe in the
HRTEM image and the well-defined spot configuration in the FFT plot
imply the epitaxial nature of the Mn3–xGa film deposited on the STO substrate. From these results,
we obtain the lattice parameters of a = 3.901 Å
and c = 7.188 Å, which also agree well with
the XRD results. The a-axis lattice parameter is
almost identical to that (=3.905 Å) of the STO substrate, so
that the lattice mismatch between the Mn3–xGa sample and the STO substrate is quite small (=0.89%). It
may provide the environment of the epitaxial growth. For the LSAT
substrate in Figure 2b, we also find the well-oriented lattice fringe in the HRTEM image
and the well-defined spot configuration in the FFT plot, similar to
the Mn3–xGa film on STO. Moreover,
we observe moiré interference patterns as shown in the inset
of Figure 2b, which
suggests the presence of small misalignment or misorientation in lattice.
The FFT pattern of the whole area shows the weakened intensity of
the (004) orientation, also reflecting a small misalignment in the c-axis-oriented matrix. This is consistent with the XRD
result showing the broad (004) peak. The lattice parameter of c = 7.378 Å, close to the value obtained from the XRD
measurement, is larger than that for the Mn3–xGa film on STO, whereas the a-axis lattice
parameter of 3.877 Å is smaller. Because the lattice parameter
of the LSAT substrate is smaller than that of the STO substrate, it
is reasonable to obtain the reduced a-axis lattice
parameter in the Mn3–xGa film on
the LSAT substrate, followed by the expanded c-axis
lattice parameter, in a viewpoint that the mass density keeps constant.
The lattice mismatch obtained for the LSAT substrate is slightly larger
(=1.86%), which may be a source for the misalignment in lattice. However,
for the LAO substrate, small grains are observed in the entire area
as shown in Figure 2c, leading to the scattered FFT patterns by the superposed small
grains. This represents a considerable amount to deviate from the
well oriented single-crystal phase, which is responsible for no observable
XRD peaks in the case of the LAO substrate. These structural changes
depending on the substrates can have influence on the electronic and
magnetic properties.

Figure 2 TEM images at the interface between the Mn3–xGa sample and the substrates of (a) STO, (b) LSAT,
and (c) LAO, and the FFT patterns obtained from each sample and the
substrate. The inset in (b) shows the moiré interference pattern
for Mn3–xGa film deposited on the
LSAT substrate.

The electrical resistivity ρ(T) curves of
Mn3–xGa films on different substrates
are shown in Figure 3, where the values are normalized to the value at 4 K for better
comparison. All the Mn3–xGa films
exhibit metallic behavior with a positive slope of ρ(T) over the entire temperature range. Note that at low temperatures
below 50 K, the ρ(T) curves for LSAT and LAO
substrates show small upturns, whereas ρ(T)
for the STO substrate is almost constant. Such resistivity minimum
has been frequently observed in metallic systems with high chemical
disorder, structural disorder, or grain boundary scattering.37−39 Especially, the disorder-related phenomena, for example, the orbital
two-channel Kondo effect has been exploited in MnGa and MnAl, which
are strongly dependent on the structural disorder.40,41 In the ρ(T) data for Mn3–xGa films on LSAT and LAO substrates, we have obtained
the resistivity upturn with a clear transition from the ln T scaling to the T1/2 scaling,
similar to the orbital two-channel Kondo behavior with enhanced disorder.40,41 Thus, the upturn features of ρ(T) in this
study can be related to the structural disorder of the films on LSAT
and LAO substrates, based on the results obtained from the structural
analyses. From the temperature dependence, we determine the residual
resistivity ratio (RRR) given by RRR = ρ(300 K)/ρ(4 K),
which decreases from 1.48 for STO substrate to 1.10 for LSAT and 1.04
for LAO. This indicates the higher quality of Mn3–xGa film on STO substrate than that on other substrates,
which is in good agreement with the results analyzed from the XRD
and TEM measurements.

Figure 3 Electrical resistivity ρ(T) of
Mn3–xGa films deposited on STO,
LSAT, and LAO substrates,
which are normalized to the value at 4 K for comparison. The insets
show the low-temperature plots for the films on LSAT, and LAO substrates.

Figure 4a–c
show the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization M(H) curves measured at 300 K for Mn3–xGa films deposited on STO, LSAT, and LAO substrates,
respectively. The magnetic signal of the sample is obtained by directly
subtracting the background signal measured with only the substrate.
The physical parameters obtained from the M(H) curves are summarized in Table 1, where the structural parameters are also
listed. With increasing the lattice mismatch from STO and LSAT to
LAO, the saturation magnetization MS of
out-of-plane component increases, and the in-plane magnetic component
is enhanced, while keeping the coercivity around 20 kOe. The M(H) curve for the sample on the STO substrate
seems to be well c-axis oriented because there is
no in-plane magnetic component around zero field. The most prominent
result in the magnetic properties is the low MS value (=10 emu/cm3), especially for the STO substrate,
which is much smaller than those (50–270 emu/cm3) reported previously.32,36 Because of the low MS, the magnetic anisotropy constant Ku is also found to be small, compared to the
previous reports.4,16 For the LSAT substrate, the MS value of out-of-plane component is still small
about 20 emu/cm3, and both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization
curves exhibit small kinks at low magnetic fields. Such kink structures
can be understood with the small misorientation, which has been already
discussed in the XRD and TEM results. The lattice misorientation is
maximized in Mn3–xGa film on the
LAO substrate, which shows no specific preferred growth orientation.
As already observed in the FFT pattern of TEM, there is a considerable
amount deviating from the oriented single-crystal phase, giving rise
to the polycrystalline nature with no magnetic anisotropy.

As discussed in the introduction
part, there are two possible structural
situations for Mn removal.23,24 Taking into consideration
the ferrimagnetic state of Mn3Ga, the removal of Mn I (Mn
II) increases (decreases) the total magnetic moment. The removal of
Mn I atoms from the 2b position is based on the experimental observation
that the magnetization increases with increasing the deficiency of
Mn, x in Mn3–xGa.24,25,32,36 However, the experimentally observed increment of
magnetization with the Mn deficiencies is too small to be explained
with only the removal of Mn I, so that the simultaneous removal of
Mn II atoms has been proposed for another scenario,23,30 but it is still more probable that more Mn I atoms are removed than
Mn II atoms. In this study, the MS value
obtained in the epitaxial Mn3–xGa film on the STO substrate is roughly 10 emu/cm3, which
is much smaller than those reported in previous studies.32,36 Although not so small, relatively low MS values of about 50 emu/cm3 have been reported using the
buffer layers such as GaAs and Cr/Pt, where the crystalline quality
is improved by the reduction of lattice mismatch.32,36 On the other hand, our Mn3–xGa
films are epitaxially grown on the STO substrate without any buffer
layer and exhibit surprisingly low MS values
while keeping the PMA. The absence of buffer layer may provide an
environment for making a metastable state, in which Mn II atoms are
predominantly removed.

According to earlier reports,23 the c-axis lattice parameter
has been used as a measure to determine
which Mn site is vacant in Mn3–xGa. The c-axis lattice parameter increases with
increasing the vacancy of Mn I by weakening the hybridization between
Mn I and Ga along the c axis, whereas the vacancy
of Mn II has little effect on the c-axis lattice
parameter. In the present work, the c-axis lattice
parameter of Mn3–xGa grown on the
STO substrate is almost same as the value for Mn3Ga (where
Mn I and Mn II sites are fully occupied) and slightly smaller than
the value for Mn2Ga (where only Mn I site is removed),
implying that the Mn I site is almost occupied and there is a considerable
amount of vacant Mn II sites. This result can also explain the low MS value. When Mn I is removed, as described
above, the MS value should increase. However,
when Mn II atoms are solely removed, net magnetization should go to
zero because of the fully compensated magnetic state. Thus, in our
Mn3–xGa thin films, the low MS is attributed to the predominant removal of
Mn II atoms.

The predominant removal of Mn II in our system
can be related to
the strain between the sample and the substrate because MS of the sample changes depending on the substrate. A
recent report has demonstrated that the strained or relaxed Mn3Ga films grown on different buffer layers exhibit distinguishable
magnetic properties: more relaxed Mn3Ga film deposited
on Mo buffer layer shows lower magnetization.42 Fairly small strain effect for STO substrate can induce the low MS as a result of the removal of Mn II. For the
LSAT substrate, the strain is supposed to be large, and hence the
total magnetization increases and the in-plane ferromagnetic component
appears at low fields. This soft ferromagnetic phase seems to arise
from the strained regions at the interface, as proposed in the strained
Mn3Ga film.26 The strain effect
is more pronounced on the LAO substrate with the largest lattice mismatch
(∼3.96%). The polycrystalline nature with no magnetic anisotropy
gives rise to the sufficiently large magnetization in both in-plane
and out-of-plane configurations.

In addition to the structural
factor of predominant removal of
Mn II atoms as one possible origin to reduce MS, we have examined the influence of chemical states of Mn
ions by using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 5 depicts the Mn 2p3/2 spectrum of Mn3–xGa
thin film grown on the STO substrate and the deconvoluted curves for
metallic Mn, Mn2+, and Mn3+ ionic states, fitted
by the Gaussian–Lorentzian asymmetric function. The peaks at
640.8 and 641.9 eV correspond to Mn2+ and Mn3+ states, respectively. The ratio of Mn3+/Mn2+ valence states is estimated to be 9.93. Because the effective magnetic
moments of the Mn3+ ionic state is smaller than that of
Mn2+, the larger population of Mn3+ ions can
be another possible origin of the reduced MS. Further experiments or theoretical calculations on strain-considered
crystal and band structures, however, are needed to study the correlation
between the Mn removal and the valence states of Mn atoms.

Mn (dash-dot line) and two ionic states of Mn2+ (dotted

3 Conclusions
Tetragonal Mn3–xGa films are
grown on STO, LSAT, and LAO substrates without any buffer layer by
rf magnetron sputtering. The structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties are strongly dependent on the substrate. As the lattice
mismatch between the sample and the substrate decreases from LAO and
LSAT to STO, the film quality is improved together with the magnetic
and electronic properties. In particular, Mn3–xGa grown on the STO substrate is an epitaxial film,
which leads to the magnetic moment fully oriented along the c axis perpendicular to the film plane. The predominant
Mn II deficiencies at 4d position and the less strained interface
are verified by the elaborate XRD and TEM analyses, resulting in the
enormously reduced MS as low as 0.06 μB (=10 emu/cm3). Although the Mn valence state is
not characterized at a specific Mn site, large populated Mn3+ ions play a role in reducing the MS in
Mn3–xGa thin films. Because the
low MS is essential for reducing the critical
switching current density, the epitaxially grown Mn3–xGa thin films can provide beneficial platform for
developing effective STT-based devices.

4 Experimental
Details
4.1 Growth of Mn3Ga Thin Films on Different
Substrates
Mn3–xGa thin
films were deposited directly on three different substrates of STO
(001), LSAT (001), and LAO (001) without any buffer layers by rf magnetron
sputtering. A single target of Mn3Ga was used in a vacuum
chamber with the base pressure of 10–7 Torr. Varying
the growth conditions, such as substrate temperature from 300 to 450
°C, argon gas pressure from 2 to 7 mTorr, and rf gun power from
30 to 55 W, was examined. Then, we found the optimal growth conditions
showing the clear PMA characteristics at each substrate; 400 °C/5
mTorr/35 W for STO, 400 °C/5 mTorr/45 W for LSAT, and 350 °C/5
mTorr/45 W for LAO. More detailed description including the growth
process and the corresponding magnetic properties can be found in Supporting Information. The thickness was approximately
100 nm for all the Mn3–xGa thin
films. After cooling to room temperature, the Mn3–xGa thin films were capped by a 5 nm thick SiO2 layer to prevent oxidation.

4.2 Characterization
and Measurements
The structural analyses were performed by
XRD using a Rigaku SmartLab
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and TEM using a Tecnai G2 F30. The chemical compositions were determined using EDS
attached to a standard SEM. To examine the chemical states of the
samples, XPS experiments were carried out with PHI 5000 VersaProbe
(Ulvac-PHI) operated with a 15 kV accelerating voltage in a vacuum
of 2 × 10–7 Pa. The magnetic and transport
properties were measured by using a superconducting quantum interface
device-vibrating sample magnetometer and Gifford-McMahon refrigerator.
The van der Pauw method was used to measure the in-plane electrical
resistivity. All the measurements were performed at room temperature
because the Curie temperature of Mn3–xGa is above 700 K.
