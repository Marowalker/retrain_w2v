Solar steam generation is critical
for many important solar-thermal
applications, but is challenging to achieve under low solar flux due
to the large evaporation enthalpy of water. Here, we demonstrate a
three-dimensional porous solar-driven interfacial evaporator that
can generate 100 °C steam under 1 sun illumination with a record
high solar-to-steam conversion efficiency of 48%. The high steam generation
efficiency is achieved by localizing solar-thermal heating at the
evaporation surface and controlling the water supply onto the porous
evaporator through tuning its surface wettability, which prevents
overheating of the evaporator and thus minimizes conductive, convective,
and radiative heat losses from the evaporator. The design of steam
outlet located at the sidewall of the evaporator rather than from
the solar absorber surface not only facilitates the collection of
generated steam, but also avoids potential blockage of solar radiation
by the condensing steam. The high-efficiency solar-driven evaporator
has been used to generate hot steam for outdoor removal of paraffin
on the wall of oil pipelines, offering a promising solution to mitigate
the wax deposition issue in petroleum extraction processes.

Introduction
The Sun is a promising
renewable energy source to propel sustainable
development of human society.1,2 In addition to direct
conversion into electricity through photovoltaic process, a facile
and efficient way to harness the abundant sunlight is converting it
into heat through solar-thermal technology.3,4 The
harvested thermal energy can drive many important processes such as
domestic heating,5 seawater desalination,6,7 sterilization,8−10 distillation,11,12 and electrical power
generation.13 In these applications, high-efficiency
steam or vapor generation at high temperatures is often desired and
critical to achieve high performance of the solar-thermal systems.
The dilute natural 1 sun solar flux (1 kW/m2), however,
does not provide sufficient solar-heating density to generate hot
steam due to the high vaporization enthalpy of water (2.26 ×
106 J/kg at 100 °C).14 In
traditional concentrated solar power steam generation technologies,
it requires high optical concentrations (10–1000×) to
generate hot steam. The expensive optical concentrators not only add
significant cost to the evaporation systems, which would limit the
deployment of solar-thermal systems in undeveloped regions, but also
sacrifice the overall energy conversion efficiency of the system due
to the increased heat losses from the hot solar receiver surfaces.

In recent years, solar-driven interfacial evaporation, which localizes
solar heating at the air–water interface rather than heating
up the bulk liquid, has emerged as a new form of evaporation design.15−18 Compared to conventional bulk heating-based evaporation, the interfacial
evaporation systems have demonstrated significantly increased solar-to-vapor
conversion efficiency and faster response due to reduced heat losses
and smaller thermal masses.15,17 In the past, great
efforts have been devoted to increasing the solar-to-vapor efficiency
to ∼90% through synthesizing new solar-absorbing materials,19−21 tailoring microstructure of the solar absorbers,22−25 improving thermal insulation,26,27 capillary water-supplying design,28,29 and optimizing
evaporator structure.30,31 More recently, the favorable
interaction between water and the hydrogel-based evaporator has been
used to reduce the water evaporation enthalpy, thereby further increasing
the evaporation mass flux.32,33 Such high-efficiency
solar-driven interfacial evaporation has enabled high-performance
steam generation,34−36 solar desalination,29,33,37−39 multifunctional clean water generation,40−43 and electricity generation44,45 under reduced solar
concentration. Most recent research interest has been directed to
vapor generation under natural 1 sun illumination condition,46−48 thus fully eliminating the requirement for optical concentrators.
Steam generation under low solar flux, in particular, 1 sun illumination
with a power density of 1 kW/m2, however, is still challenging.9,10,17,49−51 In spite of its important medical sterilization applications,
previous generation of steam at 100 °C or above requires high
optical concentration.9,10,49 Only until recently, Chen et al.52 have
reported a thermal concentration scheme and successfully generated
100 °C steam under 1 sun irradiation. The evaporator generated
steam when the thermal concentration ratio was larger than 200 with
the solar-to-steam conversion efficiency at ∼20%. Additionally,
in the solar-driven interfacial evaporation systems reported so far,
the generated vapor or steam is evaporated from the front surface
of the solar absorbers. The broad distribution of steam over a large
area not only adds difficulty in collecting the generated steam, but
also tends to affect solar absorption by the absorber. For instance,
in solar stills when the evaporated hot vapor or steam is in contact
with the transparent condensing cover, it often forms a layer of blurry
mist, which interrupts the normal receiving of sunlight for solar-thermal
conversion.47,48

In this work, we report
a three-dimensional (3D) porous solar-driven
interfacial evaporator with minimized heat losses for high-efficiency
steam generation under low solar flux. In this new porous evaporation
structure, the effective surface area for occurrence of evaporation
is amplified, thereby minimizing the conduction, radiation, and convection
heat losses from the evaporation system. Controlled water supply,
which is realized through tailoring the surface wettability of the
evaporator, is used as a means to tune the temperature of the porous
evaporator and vapor temperature. Steam is successfully produced at
an efficiency of ∼48% by the porous evaporator with hybrid
hydrophilic–hydrophobic surfaces under 1 sun illumination.
Additionally, the steam outlet is designed to be located at the sidewall
of the evaporator to facilitate steam collection without blocking
normal solar irradiation onto the absorber. Outdoor experiments show
that the collected steam can effectively heat up and melt the paraffin
deposits on the wall of pipelines, thus offering another wax mitigation
technology for petroleum industry.

Experimental Section
Materials
The selective absorber was purchased from
Dezhou Jinheng Solar Company. Copper foam (30 ppi) was supplied by
Kunshan Jiayisheng Electronics Company. Potassium hydroxide and potassium
peroxodisulfate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane was ordered from Shanghai Macklin
Biochemical. Paraffin wax was purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai).

Fabrication of Copper Foam with Hybrid Surface Wettability
The hybrid hydrophobic–hydrophilic copper foams, which are
hydrophilic at the bottom section and hydrophobic at the top section,
were prepared by a three-step surface treatment of commercial pristine
copper foams. In the first step, the surface of the whole copper foam
was oxidized by a strong alkali solution to be hydrophilic. In the
second step, the obtained hydrophilic copper foam was deposited with
a fluorosilane to convert the surface into hydrophobic. In the third
step, half of the hydrophobic copper foam was immersed within the
strong alkali solution again to convert that portion into hydrophilic.
Specifically, the commercial copper foam was first cleaned by acetone,
ethanol, and deionized water through sonication before being immersed
in the mixed solution of 0.065 M K2S2O8 and 2.5 M KOH at 60 °C. After 1 h, the oxidized hydrophilic
copper foam was washed by deionized water and dried at room temperature.
The hydrophilic copper foam was further modified with fluorinated
silane through a vapor deposition process. The hydrophobic foam was
obtained by placing the oxidized hydrophilic foam within a plastic
vacuum chamber, in which 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane is loaded.
In the final step, the obtained hydrophobic copper foam was partially
immersed in the K2S2O8/KOH solution
again to convert that part of foam surface into hydrophilic.

Steam
Generation and Paraffin Removal Test
Simulated
sunlight generated by a solar simulator (EOS-150, EOS Technologies
Inc.) or natural sunlight focused by a plastic Fresnel lens was used
to induce steam generation. The evaporation mass change of the system
was measured by a digital balance with a resolution of 0.1 mg (BSM-220,
Shanghai Zhuo Jing Electronic Technology). K-type thermocouples were
placed at the steam outlet to measure steam temperature or were attached
to the surface to monitor the real-time temperature distribution of
the evaporation system, and the measured temperatures were recorded
by a multichannel data acquisition system (Agilent 34972A). The outdoor
paraffin removal test was carried out on the roof of MSE Building
H at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The steam generator outlet was
connected to a plastic bottle by a silicone tube with a length of
5 cm, and the silicone tube was wrapped by expandable polyethylene
(thickness, 1 cm) to suppress heat loss. Within the plastic bottle,
a copper tube with an inner diameter of 1 cm was used as a simulated
oil pipeline. Paraffin (3 g) was deposited along the inner surface
of the copper tube. One thermocouple was placed at the inlet of the
paraffin removal chamber (T1), which directly measures the steam temperature
when the solar steam enters the removal chamber. Three thermocouples
(T2, T3, and T4) were uniformly attached to the inner surface of the
copper tube (6 cm long) and their surfaces were covered by a layer
of paraffin.

Measurement and Characterization
Optical absorption
spectra of the spectrally selective solar absorber and transmittance
spectra of quartz were measured by a UV–vis–NIR spectrometer
(PerkinElmer Lambda 750 S). The microstructure of air-laid paper and
copper foam was observed by field emission high-resolution SEM (Sirion
2000, FEI). The solar illumination power density was measured by a
solar power meter (CEL-NP2000, Beijing China Education Au-light).
Theoretical analyses of the heat loss, temperature distribution, and
energy conversion efficiency of the evaporation system based on energy
conservation principle and 3D COMSOL simulation are provided in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Minimizing heat loss is critical to achieve high-efficiency solar
steam generation, in particular under low solar illumination flux.
As shown in Figure 1, besides vaporizing water, part of the converted solar-thermal energy
is lost through convection and radiation from the front surface and
part of the converted heat is lost through downward conduction. The
thermal concentration approach52 relies
on concentrating the harvested solar-thermal energy toward a small
evaporation area to boost the vapor temperature (Figure 1a). Such design limits the
available surface area for water evaporation, and the suppressed evaporation
in turn causes overheating of the solar absorber. In the 3D porous
interfacial evaporator (Figure 1b), an open-pore foam is used to connect the solar absorber
and water-supplying layer to amplify the evaporation area. Through
tuning the surface wettability of the foam, the evaporation mass could
be optimized to ensure steam generation at 100 °C. With increased
evaporation flux that stores the converted solar-thermal energy as
latent heat in the hot steam, the surface temperature of the absorber
decreases, which in turn reduces the heat losses from the evaporation
system. With a temperature of 100 °C at the surface of the solar
absorber, the calculated evaporation efficiency of the porous interfacial
evaporator reaches 51% (Figure S1). Another
unique design of the steam generator is the steam outlet, which is
confined and located at the sidewall rather than on the top surface
of the solar absorber. Such design would avoid potential blocking
of solar incidence onto the absorber by the generated steam and facilitate
steam collection.

Figure 1 Structure design of a solar-driven steam generator under
low solar
flux. (a) Schematic structure of thermal concentrated interfacial
evaporator. A small hole is drilled through the surface of solar absorber,
which allows the escape of the generated steam. (b) Schematic structure
of 3D porous interfacial evaporator. The generated steam at the surface
of the porous evaporator escapes from the sidewall.

As schemed in Figure 2a, the 3D porous interfacial steam generator
contains five key components.
First, a spectrally selective solar absorber is used to absorb the
broad-band sunlight with minimized radiation loss. Second, a transparent
cover made of quartz is placed on top of the absorber. Third, an air-laid
paper is utilized as the capillary wicking material to spontaneously
pump water from the reservoir at the bottom to the solar-heating region.
In between the absorber and the air-laid paper is the copper foam
that provides ample space for the vapor generation. Finally, a thermal
insulator that is constructed from PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) foam
is placed at the bottom to float the evaporator. The entire evaporator
is sealed within a plastic beaker forming an integrated portable solar
steam generator. To reduce heat leakage from the sidewalls, the steam
generator is wrapped by thermal-insulating expandable polyethylene.

Optical spectrum measurement (Figure 2b) presents that
the low-emissivity (0.05)
spectrally selective absorber (TiNOx)
has a broad-band absorption, which fully covers the solar irradiance
spectrum with a high absorptance (0.95). The quartz cover is highly
transparent to the incident sunlight from 250 to 2500 nm with a transmittance
of 93% (Figure S2), thus allowing for the
efficient transmission of sunlight to the absorber while suppressing
the convective heat loss. To avoid direct contact between the solar
absorber and the bulk water body, the thermal insulation PDMS foam
is used as both the physical separator and floater. The low thermal
conductivity of the foam (0.03 W/(m K)) mitigates the downward heat
leakage to the water body.

The hydrophilic air-laid paper is
used as the wicking material
that delivers water to the evaporation region. To test the capillary
wicking capability of the air-laid paper, we placed it in direct contact
with a red aqueous solution that contains Rhodamine dye to observe
water movement. Figure 2c shows that the air-laid paper (5 cm long) is fully wetted by the
red solution within 30 s. By comparing the mass change before and
after sorption of water, the water sorption rate of the air-laid paper
was measured to be 35.84 kg/m2 h, which is much higher
than the theoretical maximum evaporation mass flux (1.584 kg/(m2 h)) under 1 sun illumination. Meanwhile, it should be noted
that after absorbing water, the wetted air-laid paper would become
more hydrophilic and the resultant water sorption rate would be even
higher.53 Hence, the air-laid paper can
provide sufficient water supply to compensate the evaporation mass
loss. SEM observation indicates that the air-laid paper is composed
of interweaved fibers (Figure 2d,e), and the strong capillary pumping effect results from
its surface hydrophilicity and porous microstructure.25

The porous foam is the key component to achieve large
evaporation
flux and high solar-to-steam conversion efficiency. Here, copper foam
(30 ppi, 5 mm thick) was employed to construct the porous evaporation
chamber due to its high thermal conductivity and wide availability.
The converted solar heat can be timely conducted along the network
of the copper foam to induce evaporation. For the occurrence of evaporation
on the heated surface, it also requires delivery of water from the
air-laid paper onto the surface of the copper foam. Similar to the
air-laid paper, the copper foam also relies on capillary force to
pump water from the air-laid paper to its surface. Surface wettability
is used as a means to tune the water-wicking capability of the copper
foam, thus controlling the amount of water supplied onto the foam
surface. As schemed in Figure 2f, through different surface treatment, we prepared copper
foams with hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hybrid hydrophilic–hydrophobic
surfaces and comparatively studied the evaporation performance of
the corresponding evaporators. The hydrophilic surface was obtained
through oxidizing the copper foam with a strong alkali solution.54,55 After oxidation, Figure 2g shows that the foam turned black as a result of formation
of copper hydroxide on the surface and the water contact angle decreased
from 76° for the pristine copper foam (Figure S3) to fully wetted state for the hydrophilic copper foam.
SEM observation indicates that the oxidized copper foam surface is
rough (Figure 2h) and
the surface is covered with a layer of densely distributed needlelike
nanostructure (Figure 2i). Hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 130° (Figure S3) was prepared by coating the oxidized
hydrophilic copper foam with fluorosilane (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane).
To obtain hybrid wettability, the hydrophobic copper foam was partially
immersed into the alkali solution to chemically cleave the silane
coating and convert that portion of foam into hydrophilic copper again.
For the treated copper foam with hybrid wettability, the hydrophilic
side is placed in direct contact with the air-laid paper to wick water
upward.

Figure 3a shows
the experimental setup for evaluating the steam generation performance
of the 3D porous solar-driven interfacial evaporator. A solar simulator
was used to generate solar irradiation, which penetrates the transparent
quartz cover and shines onto the spectrally selective absorber. The
evaporation mass loss was recorded by a digital balance, and a thermocouple
was placed near the outlet to measure the vapor temperature. The evaporation
efficiency (η), i.e. solar-to-vapor or solar-to-steam conversion
efficiency, is calculated by the following formula  where ṁ is the evaporation
mass change rate, hLV is the enthalpy
change of water during the evaporation process that includes both
the liquid–vapor phase change enthalpy and sensible heat, qsol is the solar flux, and A is the area of the spectrally selective absorber (13.85 cm2).

The evaporation performance of three evaporators
consisting of
hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and hybrid hydrophobic–hydrophilic
copper foams was studied. As shown in Figure 3b, the hydrophobic evaporator has shown the
fastest vapor temperature rise and reached a steady temperature after
1 sun illumination for 1000 s. It should be pointed out that due to
rapid cooling of the generated steam, the achieved steam temperature
is 97 °C, which is slightly lower than the theoretical steam
temperature of 100 °C. Under such condition, the steam is successfully
generated when the evaporator surface temperature reaches 100 °C
and the evaporation process enters the steady state.52 After illumination for 1200 s, the evaporator with hybrid
surface wettability also started steady steam generation. By contrast,
the hydrophilic evaporator has lower vapor temperature, and even after
illumination for 30 min, it did not reach 100 °C. The measured
surface temperature of the selective absorber indicates the same trend
that the hydrophobic evaporator has the highest temperature of 108
°C, the hybrid evaporator has reached 103 °C, and the hydrophilic
evaporator has the lowest temperature of 92.8 °C after the same
1 sun illumination for 30 min (Figure S4). During the experiment, it was found that even extending the illumination
time to 1 h, the vapor temperature curve of the hydrophilic evaporator
became flat, which indicates that the system has reached a thermal
balance with the atmosphere, but the vapor temperature and surface
temperature of the solar absorber could not reach 100 °C. To
characterize the evaporation rate at the steady state, the evaporation
system was subject to 1 sun illumination for 30 min before measuring
the mass change. Figure 3c presents the evaporation mass change for the three evaporators
as a function of illumination time. It shows the opposite trend to
the vapor temperature. The hydrophilic evaporator has the largest
mass loss and the hydrophobic evaporator has the smallest mass loss.
The corresponding evaporation efficiencies for the evaporator with
hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and hybrid copper foam are 37, 52, and 48%
(Figure 3d), respectively.
The solar-to-steam conversion efficiency for the evaporator with hybrid
hydrophilic–hydrophobic copper foam (48%) is more than double
the steam generation efficiency achieved in the thermal concentration
scheme (∼20%).52

It can be
seen that water supply, which is controlled by the surface
wettability of the copper foam, is the key factor that determines
the vapor temperature and evaporation efficiency. Slow water supply
from the hydrophobic copper foam facilitates the increase of the vapor
temperature to the steam temperature, but it limits the evaporation
efficiency. Fast water supply from the hydrophilic surface increases
the evaporation flux but lowers the vapor temperature. We evaluated
the water supply toward the evaporator with different hydrophilicity
by measuring the amount of water adsorbed onto the copper foam surface.
The adsorbed water affects the physical properties of the copper foam
evaporator, which in turn adjusts the evaporation performance. The
energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator can be analyzed by
deducting the heat losses from the incident solar energy input. Based
on the energy balance principle, we can analyze the evaporation efficiency
for the three evaporation systems. We measured the temperatures at
the quartz cover surface, absorber surface, and top and bottom surfaces
of the PDMS foam as the input parameters (Figure S5). Based on these measured temperatures, we estimated the
combined conduction, convection, and radiation heat losses from the
evaporator and calculated the evaporation efficiency (Figures S6 and S7). As shown in Figure 3d, the calculated evaporation
efficiency is in good agreement with experimental measurement.

To gain insight into the temperature evolution of the vapor generated
within the porous copper foams, we further carried out 3D COMSOL simulations
for the evaporation system.56 By measuring
the weight of treated copper foams before and after wetting with water,
the amount of water adsorbed by the copper foams with different wettability
was estimated. The water was adsorbed onto the copper foam through
the capillary wicking effect, which pumps water from the air-laid
paper layer toward the copper foam evaporation surfaces. In our case,
the adsorbed water only coats the surfaces of the copper foam, considering
that the large pore size (∼1 mm) of the copper foam cannot
provide the needed capillary force to fill the entire pore with water.
As schemed in Figure 1b, the porous foam provides large surface areas for the evaporation
to proceed in a 3D manner. The adsorbed water affects the thermophysical
properties of the original copper foam, including density, specific
heat capacity, and thermal conductivity. In particular, the adsorbed
water significantly increases the effective heat capacity of the copper
foam. Thus, the same amount of received solar heat can only induce
slower and smaller temperature rise in the copper foam with adsorbed
water. Figure 3e shows
the simulated vapor temperature evolution profiles as a function of
illumination time. It can be seen that the surface wettability of
the copper foam determines the temperature of the vapor generated,
and the simulated results are in good agreement with experimentally
measured temperature curves in Figure 3b. Figure 3f shows the 3D temperature distribution of the whole evaporation
system with hybrid hydrophilic–hydrophobic copper foam. It
clearly shows localized heating at the solar absorber and the copper
foam, and other parts of the evaporation system are not heated up.
After 1 sun illumination for 30 min, the temperature of the copper
foam reached 100 °C, indicating that the evaporator can successfully
generate steam.

We further investigated the influence of increased
solar illumination
intensity ranging from 2 sun (2 kW/m2) to 5 sun (5 kW/m2) that is attainable with common low-cost plastic lenses on
the steam generation performance for the evaporator with hybrid wettability. Figure 4a presents that the
evaporation mass loss increased with larger solar illumination flux. Figure 4b shows that the
evaporation efficiency gradually increases with solar flux. The solar-to-steam
conversion efficiencies reach 65 and 81% when the solar flux increases
to 2 and 5 sun, respectively. The evaporation efficiency under different
solar flux can also be estimated through deducting the heat losses
from the received solar energy, and it matches well with measured
values (Figure 4b).
Temperature measurement of the generated vapor in Figure 4c shows that stronger solar
flux shortens the heating-up time for the evaporator to reach the
steady state. For example, when the solar flux is 5 sun, it generates
steam within 4 min. By utilizing the aforementioned 3D COMSOL model,
we simulated the response time for the evaporator to reach the steady
steam generation state. As shown in Figure 4d, the heating-up time quickly decreases
with increased solar flux, implying that solar illumination power
density could be used as another means to tune the steam generation
behavior. In general, the simulated trend and experimentally measured
results are in good agreement. The slightly overestimated drop of
the heating-up time by simulation is due to the fact that the thermal
contact resistance between each component within the evaporator was
not considered in the model.

Finally, we demonstrated such porous solar-driven interfacial
evaporator
for outdoor steam generation and explored its application for the
removal of paraffin deposits from the wall of oil pipelines, which
would restrict normal crude oil flow and may eventually block the
pipeline.57,58Figure 5a presents that the outlet of the steam generator is
connected to a plastic bottle in which a copper tube filled with paraffin
inside was placed to simulate the deposition of paraffin wax on the
wall of oil pipelines. The generated hot steam warms up the copper
tube, which in turn melts the paraffin deposit. The melted paraffin
liquids slip along the tube and fall into the bottom of the container,
thus avoiding blockage of the pipeline in oil wells. Four thermocouples
were placed at the inlet (T1) and copper/paraffin interface (T2, T3,
and T4) to monitor the temperature change in the paraffin removal
chamber (Figure 5a).
The outdoor experiments were carried out on the roof of a building
in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in Shanghai, China. The main
test day was June 28, 2018, which was a cloudy day. The time-dependent
global horizontal solar irradiance was recorded by a solar power meter.
Due to roaming cloud, the solar flux from 13:00 to 14:00 varied between
150 and 420 W/m2 (Figure 5b). A Fresnel lens with a geometric concentration ratio
of 10.5 was used to focus natural sunlight. As the testing time only
lasted 1 h, we did not use any tracking or aiming system during our
experiment. Figure 5c presents that after solar irradiation for 700 s, the inlet temperature
of the plastic bottle (T1) quickly reached steady state at 97 °C,
indicating that the hot steam has diffused into the paraffin removal
chamber. After illumination for 1200 s, the temperature measured at
the interface between the paraffin wax and the inner copper tube (T2,
T3, and T4) gradually rises as a result of heat exchange between the
hot steam and the copper tube. When it passes the melting temperature
of paraffin (60 °C) at 1500 s, the temperature quickly increases
as the deposited paraffin fell apart from the copper tube. After removal
of the paraffin wax, the copper tube is subject to sensible heating
that has a higher temperature increasing rate (Figure 5c). The inset photographs of the treated
copper tube confirm that the initially deposited paraffin was fully
melted and removed from the inner surface of the copper tube.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated
an alternative solar-driven interfacial
evaporator structure to efficiently generate steam under low solar
flux. The control over the amount of water supplied onto the porous
evaporator surface is the key to simultaneously increase the vapor
temperature and prevent overheating of the evaporator, which minimizes
heat losses from the evaporation system. The capillary pumping-based
water supply allows us to change the surface wettability of the porous
evaporator, thereby tuning the water supply toward the evaporation
region. The confined steam outlet design at the sidewall rather than
directly perfuming from the whole surface of the solar absorber facilitates
the steam collection and consequent utilization of generated steam.
Besides the demonstrated wax removal application, the porous interfacial
evaporator can also be used for high-efficiency solar desalination
with improved performance. For example, it can avoid the formation
of blurry mist on the surface of the condensing cover, thus ensuring
continuous and stable operation of the evaporation process. Additionally,
the separated solar absorber and evaporation region design can mitigate
salt fouling of the absorber. The generated steam can be directly
utilized or be further pressurized to achieve even higher temperature
for sterilization applications. Given the wide availability of low-cost
materials for fabricating the evaporation system, no requirement of
costly optical concentrators, and the broad range of enabled applications,
we believe that the high-efficiency portable steam generator will
help accelerate the widespread utilization of solar-thermal technologies,
in particular, under low solar flux.
