Fluorine-doped
organosilica membranes for gas and pervaporation
(PV) separation were fabricated using a sol–gel method. NH4F and bis(triethoxysilyl)methane (BTESM) were selected as
the dopant and Si precursor, respectively, for the fabrication of
fluorine-doped organosilica membranes. Doping with fluorine was evaluated
for its effect on the physicochemical properties of organosilica (hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity
and network size). Fluorine doping dramatically eliminated the formation
of Si–OH groups in the sol, so that the condensation of Si–OH
groups during the calcination process was suppressed. It is possible
that fluorine doping enlarged the network pore sizes in organosilica,
because the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane showed superior He and H2 permeance with a low H2/N2 permeance
ratio that corresponded to the network pore size by comparison with
an undoped BTESM membrane. The F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes clearly
showed a high level of C3H6 permeance (>3.0
× 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1) with a high C3H6/SF6 permeance ratio (∼250), which suggests that the network
pore size of F-BTESM is suitable for the separation of large molecules
such as hydrocarbon gases (C3/C4, C4 isomer, etc.). Organosilica membranes
both with and without fluorine doping showed stable PV performance
because of the fact that H2O permeance and each permeance
ratio under different separation systems was approximately constant
over 10 h at 70 °C. Fluorine doping enhanced the hydrophobic
nature of the organosilica, which was confirmed by the H2O adsorption and PV properties.

1 Introduction
Amorphous
SiO2 membranes with pore sizes in the sub-nanometer
range have great potential for application to gas/liquid separation.1−3 Membrane performance (selectivity, permeability) depends on the
thickness and pore size of the separation layer, so that a thin microporous
silica layer is coated onto an intermediate layer (γ-alumina,1,3 SiO2–ZrO22) to form a porous substrate, which makes it possible to form a layer-by-layer
structure to decrease the permeation resistance. The utilization of
silsesquioxane (RSiO3/2) categorized as either a pendant-type4−8 or a bridged-type8−14 Si precursor makes it possible to control the pore size of an amorphous
structure as well as the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties, respectively,
because of the presence of nonhydrolyzable organic groups. The network
structure of bridged-type organosilica utilizing bis(triethoxysilyl)methane
(BTESM) and bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTESE) via a sol–gel
method is suitable for H2/organic compounds8,11 and C3H6/C3H810 separation, respectively, because the spacer
(Si–CH2–Si, Si–C2H4–Si unit) can work as a minimum unit in networks for
the construction of a loose network structure.

The effect that
a linking unit with a carbon number larger than
C3 (Si–C3H6–Si) exerts on network
pore size and on a microporous structure was also evaluated by fabricating
organosilica membranes such as [bis(triethoxysilyl)propane (BTESP),
bis(trimethoxysilyl)hexane (BTMSH), bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, and
bis(triethoxysilyl)octane (BTESO)].14 The
network size determined by gas permeation properties became larger
as the carbon number increased between 2 Si atoms, and H2 selectivity was decreased as the carbon number between 2 Si atoms
increased, but despite having larger network pore sizes, the BTESP
(Si–C3H6–Si), BTMSH (Si–C6H12–Si), and BTESO (Si–C8H16–Si) membranes showed smaller values for gas
permeance compared with either the BTESM or the BTESE membranes. The
increased flexibility of the linking units in the structures of Si–C3H6–Si, Si–C6H12–Si, and Si–C8H16–Si membranes
tended to collapse the micropores and decrease the porosity, which
was confirmed by the measurement of N2 adsorption properties.
This tendency suggests that increased flexibility might not be appropriate
for the formation of highly permeable membranes.

The incorporation
of Si–F bonds in the SiO2 structure
via the addition of NH4F and/or the utilization of triethoxyfluorosilane
was an innovative strategy to control the physicochemical properties
dictating the amorphous nature of SiO2, which includes
hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity and network pore size.15−21 Hydrophobic surface modification of porous media [mesoporous silica
(MCM-41), zeolite] was successfully achieved by replacing the Si–OH
groups with Si–F groups.15−17 The incorporation of Si–F
bonds affected the Si–O–Si bond angle,18−20 and this change in the SiO2 structure made it possible
to form a loose and uniform structure rather than that of SiO2.19−21 Highly permeable gas separation membranes such as
CO2/CH4 (CO2 permeance: 4.1 ×
10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1, CO2/CH4 permeance
ratio: 300 at 35 °C)19 and C3H6/C3H8 (C3H6 permeance: 2.2 × 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1, C3H6/C3H8 permeance ratio: 42 at 35 °C)21 were tailored via a fluorine-induced SiO2 matrix. The pore size distribution obtained by single-gas
permeation showed that densification of the network structure for
a fluorine-induced SiO2 matrix was suppressed even under
high temperatures and/or a hydrothermal atmosphere.20,21

In the present study, NH4F and BTESM were selected
as
the dopant and Si precursor, respectively, to fabricate fluorine-doped
BTESM membranes that could then be used to evaluate the effect that
fluorine doping exerts on the organosilica network size as well as
on the gas permeation and pervaporation (PV) properties. The fluorine
doping of a network structure was characterized via X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, and
N2 adsorption properties. The hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity
of organosilica was evaluated via H2O adsorption.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Fluorine Doping
on the Physicochemical
Properties of Organosilica
Figure 1 shows the FT-IR spectra for BTESM (a) and
F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) (b) films before/after calcination at 350 °C.
Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching vibrations were detected
at around 1050–1100 cm–122,23 in both samples, irrespective of fluorine doping. Grill and Neumayer22 reported that the peak at around 1100 cm–1 can be ascribed to the larger-angle Si–O–Si
bonds in a cage structure with a bond angle of approximately 150°,
while the peak at around 1050 cm–1 can be ascribed
to the stretching of the smaller-angle Si–O–Si bonds
in a network structure. The peak at 960–980 cm–1 can be ascribed to the stretching of Si–OH bonds.23 Both asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching
vibrations of −CH2– fragments were detected
in both samples at 2932 and 1350 cm–1,24,25 respectively, irrespective of fluorine doping and with/without calcination.
This indicated that organosilica networks with linking units (Si–CH2–Si) were formed by the hydrolysis/condensation of
the ethoxy and silanol groups, respectively. Interestingly, the F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) film showed fewer chemisorbed H2O molecules
(3400 cm–1)23 compared
with the BTESM film.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of BTESM (a) and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) (b)
films before/after
calcination at 350 °C under an air atmosphere.

The peak area ratios for Si–OH (960–980
cm–1)/Si–O–Si (1050–1100 cm–1)
in both samples before/after calcination at 350 °C are summarized
in Table 1 to demonstrate
the effect of fluorine doping on Si–OH groups. The BTESM film
showed a higher value for the Si–OH/Si–O–Si peak
area ratio compared with that of the F-BTESM film (F/Si = 1/9), but
the peak area ratio was largely decreased after calcination. On the
other hand, the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) film showed a lower value for
the Si–OH/Si–O–Si peak area ratio, and only a
slight decrease was confirmed after calcination at 350 °C. Thus,
fluorine doping eliminated the formation of Si–OH groups in
the sol (before calcination), and the condensation of Si–OH
groups was suppressed during the calcination process.

Figure 2 shows the
XPS spectra in the range of 0–1200 eV (a) and from 680 to 695
eV (b) for F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) powders calcined at 350 °C. The
F/Si molar ratio was calculated from each peak area ratio: Si 2p at
104.6 eV; F 1s and Si–F at 688 eV;26 and C–F at 685–687.5 eV.27,28 When NH4F was doped into an amorphous SiO2 structure derived from TEOS, the doped F was present as Si–F
bonds, which could be detected at 688 eV.19,20 On the other hand, when NH4F was doped into the organosilica
structure derived from BTESM (Si–C–Si unit), only a
slight peak at 688 eV was detected, and the largest peak was detected
in the range of 685–687.5 eV, which can be ascribed to semi-ionic
and covalent C–F bonds. F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) calcined at 350
°C showed approximately the same fluorine concentration as the
fluorine-doped concentration (10 mol %) in the sol, which confirmed
no direct decomposition of NH4F at 145–225 °C.29

Figure 3a shows
the N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K (0 < P/Ps < 0.1) for BTESM and F-BTESM (F/Si
= 1/9) powders calcined at 350 °C under an air atmosphere. Both
samples showed a trend whereby the adsorbed amount of N2 increased with increase in the relative pressure, indicating microporous
properties. However, the slope of F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) was higher
than that of BTESM. Fluorine doping effectively increased the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and pore volume, as summarized in Table 2.

Figure 3b shows
the H2O adsorption isotherms at 25 °C for BTESM and
F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) powders calcined at 350 °C. The amounts
of H2O adsorbed onto both samples were normalized by the
BET surface area. The adsorbed amounts of H2O on BTESM
gel powders increased in an approximately linear fashion with relative
pressure increases in the range of 0–0.2, which showed a type
III adsorption isotherm. This is because BTESM displays hydrophobic
properties by comparison with conventional SiO2 because
of the presence of organic linking units (Si–CH2–Si). A similar H2O adsorption property was reported
in hydrophobic carbonized-template molecular sieve silica.30 F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) gel powder showed a very
low amount of H2O adsorption volume, despite having a larger
pore volume compared with that of BTESM. Thus, fluorine doping significantly
increased the hydrophobic property of organosilica because the density
of Si–OH groups in F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) was much smaller than
that in BTESM.

2.2 Gas Permeation Properties
of Fluorine-Doped
Organosilica Membranes
Figure 4 shows the molecular size dependence of gas permeance
at 200 °C for BTESM and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes calcined
at 350 °C. Both membranes showed values for H2 permeance
that were higher than 10–6 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1 and permeance ratios
for H2/SF6 that were above 1000, which was much
higher than the Knudsen ratio (H2/SF6: 8.54).
The F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane clearly showed lower H2 selectivity (H2/N2, H2/C3H8) compared with that of the BTESM membrane. For example,
the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane showed H2/N2 and H2/C3H8 permeance ratios of
4.9 and 11, while those for BTESM were 14 and 690, respectively. The
BTESM membrane showed a C3H6 permeance of 2.0
× 10–8 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1 with a C3H6/C3H8 permeance ratio of 13 at 200 °C, which indicated
the appropriate network pore size for C3H6/C3H8 separation, as discussed in a previous paper.10 On the other hand, the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9)
membrane was less selective for C3H6/C3H8 (C3H6/C3H8 permeance ratio: 2.2) because of the enlarged network pore size,
which decreased the molecular sieving properties.

Figure 4 Molecular diameter dependence
of gas permeance (a) and dimensionless
permeance based on He permeance (b) at 200 °C for BTESM and F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) membranes.

Figure 4b
shows
the molecular size dependence of dimensionless permeance based on
He permeance at 200 °C for BTESM and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes.
The calculated dimensionless permeance based on He under the Knudsen
mechanism is shown by the broken lines in the same figure. The dimensionless
permeance for a BTESM membrane appeared to roughly follow the range
of a Knudsen mechanism for He (0.26 nm) and CO2 (0.33 nm).
The values of dimensionless permeance for molecules larger than N2 were smaller than those calculated under a Knudsen mechanism,
and each value was clearly decreased with increases in the molecular
size. On the contrary, the value of dimensionless permeance for the
F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane was approximately the same as that calculated
in the range of He and C3H6, which indicated
that gas molecules with molecular sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.5 nm
permeated the fluorine-organosilica network structure by Knudsen diffusion.
The values of dimensionless permeance for C3H8 and SF6 molecules were smaller than those under Knudsen
diffusion, which indicated that molecular sieving dominated the large-molecule
permeation. Thus, fluorine doping is viable as a method that can be
used to enlarge the network pore sizes of organosilica.

Theoretical
analysis was used to estimate the pore sizes of BTESM
and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes. Figure S1 shows the relationship between k0,i1/3 and di for BTESM and F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) membranes calcined at 350 °C. The pore sizes for
BTESM and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes were calculated at 0.49 and
0.62 nm, respectively, based on a modified gas translation model.
It should be noted that the average pore size for a F-BTESM (F/Si
= 1/9) membrane by nanopermporometry measurement was 0.5 nm.

It is difficult to estimate the membrane quality of microporous
membranes with a large network pore size, because molecular sieving
only works for large molecules, as shown in Figure 4b. In the present study, the relationship
between H2 permeance and the H2/SF6 permeance ratio is generally used as a benchmark for the separation
of H2 over organic compounds such as toluene and methylcyclohexane.
Because of the relatively large molecular sizes, the C3H6/SF6 permeance ratio (C3H6: 0.468 nm, SF6: 0.55 nm) was used to estimate
the membrane quality.

Figure 5a shows
the trade-off curve at 200 °C (H2 permeance vs H2/SF6 permeance ratio) for organosilica (BTESM,
BTESE,8,11,14,31 and BTESO14,31), F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9),
and zeolite (DDR, CHA, FAU, MFI)32−35 membranes. The solid line in
this figure represents the trade-off between the BTESM and F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) membranes. The BTESE (Si–C2H4–Si) membranes showed high levels of H2/SF6 permeation properties. The BTESO membranes with flexible
linking units (Si–C8H16–Si) showed
lower values for H2 permeance (<10–6 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1), which suggests that increased flexibility is inappropriate for
the formation of highly permeable membranes.14 F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes showed higher levels of H2 permeance with moderate H2/SF6 permeance ratios
compared with BTESM membranes, but the plotted results fell approximately
within the trade-off curve. Thus, the network pore sizes of BTESM
and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes were inadequate for the separation
of H2 over large molecules.

Figure 5 Trade-off curve at 200
°C [H2 permeance vs H2/SF6 permeance
ratio (a); C3H6 permeance vs C3H6/SF6 permeance
ratio (b)] for organosilica (BTESM, BTESE,8,11,14,31 and BTESO14,31), F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9), and zeolite (DDR, CHA, FAU, and MFI)32−35 membranes.

Figure 5b shows
the trade-off curve at 200 °C (C3H6 permeance
vs C3H6/SF6 permeance ratio) for
organosilica (BTESM, BTESE11) and F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) membranes. In general, the C3H6/SF6 permeance ratio decreases as the C3H6 permeance increases because of the presence of interparticle
pores in a membrane. The solid line in this figure marks the trade-off
for organosilica (BTESM, BTESE11) membranes.
F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes clearly showed the properties that
dictate a high level of C3H6/SF6 permeation.
Values for the kinetic diameter36 and L-J
length constant37 for hydrocarbon gases
(C3, C4) lay approximately between the sizes of C3H6 (0.468 nm) and SF6 (0.55 nm), and these are generally
used as the effective molecular size for porous media, which makes
the network pore size of F-BTESM suitable for the separation of hydrocarbon
gases (C3/C4, C4 isomer, etc.).

Figure 6 shows a
schematic image of the effect of fluorine doping on an organosilica
network structure before/after calcination. As described in the previous
section, fluorine doping was present as Si–F and C–F
(covalent and semi-ionic, respectively) bonds in the organosilica
network. Fluorine doping eliminated the formation of Si–OH
groups in the sol, and the condensation of Si–OH groups during
the calcination process was suppressed. Wang et al.38 evaluated the effect of calcination temperature (100–300
°C) on the network pore size of organosilica (BTESE) and concluded
that He selectivity and the H2O/alcohol separation factor,
corresponding to network pore size, were increased largely as calcination
temperature was increased from 100 to 200 °C because of the condensation
of Si–OH groups. Thus, the suppression of condensation from
the Si–OH groups during the calcination process would have
been a factor in the formation of a loose network structure via fluorine
doping into organosilica. Because the incorporation of Si–F
bonds affected the Si–O–Si bond angle, this change in
the organosilica structure could also have helped promote the formation
of looser organosilica and F–SiO2 network structures.19−21

network structure before/after calcination.

2.3 PV Performance of Fluorine-Doped Organosilica
Membranes
Figure 7 shows the time courses for permeance and the permeance ratios
through BTESM (a) and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) (b) membranes in EtOH/H2O, IPA/H2O, and n-BuOH/H2O systems at 70 °C under PV. In the present study, each alcohol
concentration in the feed was controlled at 90 wt %. The BTESM membrane
showed H2O permeance of approximately 2.0 × 10–6 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1, irrespective of the separation systems (EtOH/H2O, IPA/H2O, and n-BuOH/H2O), but the permeance of each alcohol was decreased as the molecular
size increased (molecular size of alcohol systems: EtOH: 0.43 nm,
IPA: 0.47 nm, and n-BuOH: 0.49 nm).39 For example, the permeance values for EtOH, IPA, and n-BuOH through the BTESM membrane were approximately 4.0
× 10–8, 5.0 × 10–9,
and 3.0 × 10–9 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1, which were approximately
1/50, 1/400, and 1/700 that of H2O permeance, respectively,
and indicated the differences in the molecular sieving mechanisms
of these molecules. The permeance values for IPA and n-BuOH reflected their similar molecular sizes.39

Figure 7 Time course for each permeance and permeance ratio through BTESM
(a) and F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) (b) membranes in EtOH/H2O,
IPA/H2O, and n-BuOH/H2O systems
at 70 °C under PV.

PV performances were similar for the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9)
membrane,
and the permeance of H2O was approximately constant irrespective
of the separation system, but the permeance of EtOH was higher than
that of either IPA or n-BuOH. It should be noted
that organosilica membranes showed stable PV performance, irrespective
of fluorine doping, because of the fact that H2O permeance
and each permeance ratio under different separation systems was approximately
constant over the course of 10 h at 70 °C.

The permeance
values for H2O, EtOH, IPA, and n-BuOH
were plotted as the function of each molecular size
together with those of gas molecules at 200 °C, as shown in Figure 8. The permeance of
H2O through the BTESM membrane was higher than that of
either He or H2, despite the larger molecular size. The
differences in permeation temperature between single-gas permeation
(200 °C) and PV (70 °C) can be explained via the adsorption
of H2O molecules by organosilica.38,40,41 The H2O molecules adsorbed by
organosilica networks permeate via a surface diffusion mechanism.
A similar trend was confirmed in BTESE (Si–C2H4–Si) membranes,38,40,41 which show a hydrophobic nature by comparison with BTESM membranes.
The values of EtOH, IPA, and n-BuOH fell approximately
within the curve of molecular size dependence for gas permeance at
200 °C.

Figure 8 Molecular diameter dependence of each permeance in gas
permeation
and PV for BTESM (a) and F-BTESM (Fi/Si = 1/9) (b) membranes. The
permeance values for He, H2, CO2, N2, CH4, C3H8, C3H6, and SF6 were measured at 200 °C for single-gas
permeation, while those of H2O, EtOH, IPA, and n-BuOH were measured at 70 °C under PV.

The F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane showed He and
H2 permeance
values that were higher than 2.0 × 10–6 mol
m–2 s–1 Pa–1, which was approximately twice that of the BTESM membrane because
of the enlarged network pore size. The H2O permeance for
the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane, however, was approximately the
same as that for the BTESM membrane. This result can be explained
by the hydrophobic nature of F-BTESM, which impedes H2O
permeation, although the effective molecular size of H2O was sufficiently small to allow permeation through the loose F-BTESM
network. The permeance of H2O through the F-BTESM (F/Si
= 1/9) membrane was lower than that for either He or H2, which indicates that molecular sieving dominates permeation by
H2O molecules. The F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane showed
higher values for alcohol permeance by comparison with a BTESM membrane.
Because there were no large differences in the alcohol adsorption
properties between F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) and BTESM, as shown in Figure S2, the increased alcohol permeance through
F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) could have been caused mainly by decreases in
the molecular sieving properties because of loose F-BTESM networks.

3 Conclusions
Fluorine-doped organosilica membranes
for gas/liquid separation
were fabricated via a sol–gel method. NH4F and BTESM
were selected as the dopant and Si precursor, respectively, to fabricate
fluorine-doped organosilica membranes that were used to evaluate the
effect of doped fluorine on the physicochemical properties of organosilica
(hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, network size). Fluorine doping was
present as Si–F and C–F (covalent and semi-ionic, respectively)
bonds in the organosilica network. Fluorine doping eliminated the
formation of Si–OH groups in the sol, so that the condensation
of Si–OH groups during the calcination process was suppressed.

Fluorine doping enlarged the network pore sizes of organosilica,
and the F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membrane showed He and H2 permeance
that was superior that of a BTESM membrane. The F-BTESM membrane also
had a lower H2/N2 permeance ratio that corresponded
to the network pore size. F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) membranes clearly showed
high C3H6/SF6 permeation properties
(C3H6 permeance: >3.0 × 10–7 mol m–2 s–1 Pa–1, C3H6/SF6 permeance ratio: ∼250),
which shows that the network pore sizes of the F-BTESM are suitable
for the separation of hydrocarbon gases (C3/C4, C4 isomer, etc.).

Organosilica membranes both with and without fluorine doping showed
a stable PV performance, and both H2O permeance and permeance
ratios under different separation systems were approximately constant
over 10 h at 70 °C. Fluorine doping enhanced the hydrophobic
nature of organosilica, which was confirmed by the results of H2O adsorption and PV.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of the Fluorine-Doped Organosilica
Sol and Membrane Fabrication
A fluorine-doped organosilica
sol was prepared via the hydrolysis and polymerization of BTESM with
the addition of NH4F in ethanol with water and HNO3. A specified amount of BTESM and NH4F was added
to ethanol under vigorous stirring at 25 °C [fluorine/Si = 1/9
(molar ratio)]. Then, a specified amount of HNO3 and water
was added to maintain the solution composition at a BTESM/H2O/EtOH/HNO3 molar ratio of 1/200/1393/0.1 under a BTESM
wt % of 0.5.

Fluorine-doped organosilica membranes were formed
onto porous α-alumina tubes (porosity: 47%, pore size: 2.1 μm)
that were provided by the Nikkato Corporation. First, two types of
α-alumina particles (average particle diameter: 200 nm, 2 μm)
were dispersed in a SiO2–ZrO2 sol (average
sol size: 200 nm) and coated onto the substrate, which was followed
by calcination at 550 °C under an air atmosphere in order to
form a defect-free intermediate layer.10,11,14 Then, an F-BTESM (F/Si = 1/9) sol diluted to 0.15
wt % was coated onto the intermediate layer, which was followed by
calcination at 350 °C under air for 30 min. In the present study,
a hot coating method that was originally proposed by Asaeda42 was applied. In this method, a diluted F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) sol was coated onto the intermediate layer at around
120 °C, which can prevent the formation of pores in the mesopore
range during the drying process. These procedures were repeated approximately
four times to form a thin defect-free separation layer.

4.2 Preparation and Characterization of Fluorine-Doped
Organosilica Films and Gels
Powdered samples of the F-BTESM
(F/Si = 1/9) gels were prepared by drying at 40 °C, which was
followed by calcination at 350 °C under air for 30 min, and then,
a mortar was used to grind the dried compound. The N2 and
H2O adsorption isotherms of the organosilica powder were
measured at 77 K and 25 °C, respectively (BELMAX, BELJAPAN INC.).
The condition of both the fluorine doping in the organosilica structure
and that of the fluorine concentration for powdered samples was evaluated
via XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi, Al Kα = 1486.6
eV). A FT-IR spectrometer was used to measure the FT-IR spectra of
the films coated onto Si-wafers (FT/IR-4100, Jasco, Japan).

4.3 Gas Permeation and PV Measurement
Single-gas permeation
was conducted using the experimental apparatus
shown in Figure 9a.10,14 First, a membrane was pretreated at 300 °C under a N2 flow to remove the chemisorbed water molecules. Pure gases (He,
H2, CO2, N2, CH4, C3H8, C3H6, and SF6) were fed to the outside (upstream) of a cylindrical membrane at
200 kPa, while the permeate side was maintained at atmospheric pressure.
An electric furnace controlled the temperature of the permeation cell.
A bubble film meter was used to measure the permeation rate.

Figure 9 Schematic diagram
of the single-gas permeation (a) and PV (b) experiment.

The experimental PV apparatus is shown in Figure 9b.43 Fabricated
membranes were soaked in an aqueous solution with each alcohol concentration
at 90 wt % (water/EtOH, water/IPA, water/BuOH) under a temperature
of 70 °C. A reduction in the effect of temperature and concentration
polarization on H2O flux was accomplished by circulating
the solution at approximately 1600 rpm. The feed side was maintained
at atmospheric pressure, while a vacuum pump (nearly 0 kPa) was used
to evacuate the permeate side. A cold trap used liquid nitrogen to
collect the permeated vapor, and the compositions of the feed and
permeate streams were calculated by gas chromatography using a TCD
detector (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Japan; Column: Porapak P). During the
PV experiment, water was periodically added to the feed solution to
control the concentration of the feed.
