The corrosion inhibition ability
of 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) and
1,3-diisopropyl-2-thiourea (ITU) for mild steel in 1.0 M hydrochloric
was studied by using the potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) curves,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), quantum chemical calculations,
and Monte Carlo simulations. Conditions which influence the capacity
of corrosion inhibition including concentration, structure of thiourea
derivatives, and environment temperature were taken into investigation.
The highest inhibition efficiencies of PTU and ITU are 98.96 and 92.65%
at a concentration of 5 × 10–3 M at 60 °C.
In fact, corrosion inhibition ability of PTU is better than that of
ITU in acidic solution due to the presence of the benzene ring of
PTU. EIS data are very well correlated with PDP results. In addition,
the higher inhibition performance with enhancing temperature and the
values of ΔG0 indicated that PTU
and ITU participate in chemical adsorption on the metal surface. Their
adsorption process on the metal surface follow the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm. Both experimental and theoretical results in this study
are in good agreement.

1 Introduction
Corrosion
inhibition is one of the issues that has been extensively
considered and studied because it is one of the most useful ways to
protect materials with low cost and high efficiency.1−5 There have been a number of published papers and reports on effective
organic inhibitors which contain heteroatoms (such as O, N, and S)
and triple bonds or conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings in their
molecular structures.6−10

In many sulfur- and nitrogen-containing compounds, thiourea
derivatives
are highly appreciated for their metal corrosion inhibition ability.11 Abdel-Rehim and co-workers prepared and studied
the iron corrosion inhibition ability of 1,3-diarylidenethiourea in
1.0 M HCl solution by using electrochemical frequency modulation.
The results showed that the inhibition performance of this compound
was 80.4% at the concentration of 9 × 10–4 M.12 One other study of Li et al. concluded that
allyl thiourea is a good corrosion inhibitor for steel in H3PO4 solution. With the concentration of 0.5 mM, the inhibition
efficiency of allyl thiourea is larger than 95%.13 Corrosion inhibition of 1-methyl-3-pyridin-2-yl-thiourea
was also investigated in H2SO4 solution with
different techniques by Hosseini and Azimi.14 The result of potentiostatic polarization measurement demonstrated
that this compound acts as a mixed-type inhibitor with an efficiency
of 96.4% with a concentration of 100 ppm. Besides steel, thiourea
derivatives are used to inhibit many other metals such as aluminum,
copper, zinc, and so on15−17

Recently, our team has
also investigated the corrosion inhibition
ability of 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) in both 1.0 M HCl and 3.5% wt
NaCl solutions at 30 °C. As a result, its performance is better
than that of urotropine, a well-known traditional inhibitor.18 To the best of our knowledge, 1,3-diisopropyl-2-thiourea
(ITU), one of the thiourea derivatives, has not been examined as a
corrosion inhibitor for steel. Therefore, in this study, ITU is selected
along with PTU to investigate and compare their inhibition performance
in 1.0 M HCl solution under different conditions.

Thiourea derivatives
are often adsorption inhibitors which form
a chemisorptive bond with the metal surface and impede ongoing electrochemical
dissolution reactions.19 The adsorption
of an organic compound onto the surface of the metal is dependent
on the physicochemical properties of the corrosion inhibitors, involving
steric factors, functional groups, electron density at the donor atoms,
and π orbital character of donating electrons.20 While PTU has a benzene ring in its molecule, ITU has a
long carbon chain. The purpose of this paper is to find out how the
structures of these thiourea derivatives influence on their corrosion
inhibition performance. In addition, the effect of temperature is
also investigated to find the right conditions for better inhibition
ability of these compounds.

On the basis of the data obtained
from potentiodynamic polarization
(PDP) curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chemical
quantum calculations using the density functional theory, a detailed
study on the corrosion inhibition ability of PTU and ITU (Figure 1, Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information for more details) is reported.
Moreover, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique is also used to
examine the adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the metal surface.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Experimental
Study
2.1.1 Effect of PTU and ITU Concentrations on
Inhibition Efficiency
Two experimental methods used to investigate
the effect of inhibitor concentration on inhibition efficiency at
30 °C are PDP curves and EIS. The PDP curves for mild steel in
1.0 M HCl measured in the absence and presence of various concentrations
of PTU and ITU inhibitors are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Polarization curves of steel in 1.0 M HCl with
various concentrations
of (a) PTU (reprinted from ref (18)) and (b) ITU in 1 h at 30 °C.

There are two processes which control the corrosion rate of steel
in hydrochloric acid, involving the hydrogen evolution reaction and
dissolution reaction of iron. According to this mechanism, anodic
dissolution of iron includes the following steps2,21 1   2   3   4  

The cathodic hydrogen evolution
mechanism can be expressed via
following equations 5   6   7  

When the corrosion potential is shifted
toward the negative, the
cathode reaction is essential, that is, the anode reaction is inhibited.
It means that the anodic dissolution is inhibited by a passive membrane
which is formed due to the presence of the inhibitors. Figure 2 shows that the presence of
PTU and ITU reduces the corrosive current strength of both cathode
and anodic currents.

The corrosion rate of low carbon steel
depends on the concentration
of inhibitors. For PTU, when the concentration changes, the inhibition
performance changes significantly. However, for ITU, the performance
only changes much at a concentration of 5 × 10–3 M; therefore, the graph shows overlapping corrosion lines in the
concentration range of 10–4 to10–3 M. At different concentrations of inhibitors, the anode current
densities seem to vary slightly, while cathode current densities are
significantly affected. Data in Figure 2 also confirm that the corrosion potential shifts toward
the negative value when increasing the concentration of ITU and PTU.
This suggests the cathodic predominance of the inhibitors. Furthermore,
the values of cathodic (βc) and anodic (βa) Tafel constants change slightly when adding PTU and ITU,
which means that the corrosion mechanism of steel in acid solution
does not change in the presence of these inhibitors.

Besides,
the significant change of the corrosion potentials when
adding the inhibitors proves that the inhibition for this system cannot
be caused by the geometric blocking effect but may be due in the main
to the active site blocking effect.22 The
organic inhibitors function through adsorption on the metal surface
blocking the active sites by displacing water molecules and forming
a compact barrier film to prevent the corrosion process23 (see Table 1 for more details).

Nyquist diagrams for steel in 1.0
M HCl with the presence of PTU
and ITU are displayed in Figure 3. All the impedance spectra exhibit one single capacitive
semicircle. This shows that the charge transfer process of the corrosion
process and double layer behavior mainly control the corrosion of
carbon steel.24 However, these diagrams
are not perfect semicircles due to frequency dispersion.25

Figure 3 Nyquist plots of the corrosion of mild steel in 1.0 M
HCl with
different concentrations of (a) PTU and (b) ITU at 30 °C.

The shapes of Nyquist diagrams with the presence
of inhibitors
change insignificantly when comparing with that of the blank. This
leads to conclude that the mechanism of the corrosion process does
not change when adding inhibitors.

To analyze the experimental
results, an appropriate equivalent
circuit model is required to correctly fit the impedance curves. The
equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 4. All of the impedance parameters such as solution
resistance (Rs), charge resistance (Rct), and double-layer capacitance (Cdl) are calculated and listed in Table 2 based on the fitting of Nyquist plots with
the proposed electrochemical circuit using Thales 4.5 software.

CPE
is the constant phase element to replace double-layer capacitance
(Cdl) for more accurate fit. The impedance
of the CPE can be given by eq 8(26) 8  where Yo is the
CPE constant, j is the imaginary unit, ω is
the angular frequency, and n is the CPE exponent.
If the electrode surface is homogeneous and plane, n is equal to 1, and the electrode surface can be treated as an ideal
capacitance. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) can be simulated via CPE from eq 9(27) 9  where
ωmax = 2πfmax, fmax (Hz) is
the frequency corresponding to the maximum value of the imaginary
component of the Nyquist plot.

When there is the presence of
inhibitors in solution, Rct values increase,
and Cdl values decrease. These may suggest
that the inhibitors form a protective
layer on the electrode surface. This layer makes a barrier for mass
and charge transfer.28 Moreover, Rct values of PTU are higher than that of ITU
at the same concentration, which proves that PTU can inhibit better
than ITU. The best inhibition efficiency of PTU and ITU are 93.33
and 82.63% according to the EIS method.

In the presence of inhibitors, n decreases with
the increase of the concentration. This shows an increase of the surface
inhomogeneity as a result of the inhibitor adsorption.29

Regarding to the data in Tables 1 and 2, there is a good agreement
between the inhibition efficiencies calculated from the EIS and those
obtained from PDP curves. Thus, for convenience, the experiments at
other temperatures were only investigated by PDP curves.

2.1.2 Effect of Thiourea Derivative Structure
on Inhibition Efficiency
The functional groups and structure
of the inhibitor molecules have important roles in adsorption because
they decide the number of adsorption sites, their charge density,
molecular size, and mode of interaction with the metal surface.30 PTU and ITU are both derivatives of thiourea.
They are only different from the molecular structures of the substituents
nearby the nitrogen atom. In the experimental part, at the same concentration
and temperature, inhibition ability of PTU is always higher than that
of ITU. At 30 °C, the highest inhibition efficiency of PTU is
94.95%, while it is 83.33% for ITU according to PDP curves. Clearly,
their inhibition actions depend on the nature of the substituent.8 The rest of the inhibitor molecule affects on
the electron density at the functional group; therefore, it also influences
on the adsorption on the metal surface. In the PTU molecule, an important
structural factor is a benzene ring because it rises electrostatic
interaction between inhibitors and metal surface.31 Regarding to this point, PTU is capable of forming a strong
bond with the mild steel surface. Besides, PTU is suggested to give
the higher coverage due to the aromatic ring.32 Therefore, it gives better inhibition performance than ITU.

2.1.3 Effect of Temperature on Inhibition Efficiency
Inhibition
capacity of PTU and ITU also were examined at different
temperatures of 20, 30, 45, and 60 °C with a tolerance of 1 °C.
PTU exhibits effective inhibition with high inhibition performance:
92.00% at 20 °C, 94.95% at 30 °C, 96.65% at 45 °C,
and 98.96% at 60 °C (Table 1). ITU’s inhibition performances are only 80.80%
at 20 °C, 83.33% at 30 °C, 90.33% at 45 °C, and 92.65%
at 60 °C.

Figure 5 shows that when the temperature increases, the inhibition
efficiencies of PTU and ITU increase. This may be explained that the
adsorption of PTU and ITU on the metal surface is chemisorption.33 In this case, the interaction between inhibitor
molecules and metal will form coordinate bonds by giving lone electron
pairs of sulfur and nitrogen to empty orbitals of iron atoms.

between concentrations of (a) PTU and (b) ITU and
their inhibition efficiencies at different temperatures.

2.1.4 Adsorption Isotherms
The adsorption
isotherms can generate the important information relating to the interaction
between the inhibitors and metal surface.9,34 Regarding
this approach, various models of the adsorption isotherm are recommended.35,36 And in this study, we proposed to use Temkin and Langmuir adsorption
isotherms to investigate the adsorption mechanism of thiourea derivatives.

Temkin equation is shown in the following37,38 10  

Langmuir equation is written
in the following form39,40 11  where, K is the equilibrium
constant of the adsorption reaction, “a”
is the lateral interaction term describing the interactions in the
adsorption layer and the heterogeneity of the surface, and θ
is surface coverage values.

The correlation coefficient (R2) is
used to assess whether the adsorption isotherm model is consistent
with the experimental data.41 According
to Figure 6, the correlation
coefficients of the plots between ln C versus θ
are considerably different from unit (except for R2 at 20, 45 °C). They prove that adsorption of PTU
and ITU on the steel surface do not follow the Temkin isotherm. Next,
Langmuir adsorption is applied for evaluation and is shown in Figure 7. The straight lines
between C and C/θ are found
with the correlation coefficients close to 1, and the slope values
in the Langmuir equation are approximately equal to 1 (Table 3). These results prove that
the adsorption of PTU and ITU on the electrode surface obeys the Langmuir
adsorption isotherm, and each PTU or ITU molecule only accounts for
one adsorption position. Besides, K values are also
computed and shown in Table 3.

2.2 Thermodynamic
Parameters
The standard
adsorption enthalpy (ΔH0) is calculated
using van’t Hoff equation 12  

The equation
can be changed42 13  where A is the integral constant.

The linear
correlation coefficients (R2) are 0.999
and 0.999 for ITU and PTU, respectively (Figure 8). From the slope of the straight
lines of ln K versus 1/T, ΔH0 is calculated in Table 4.

 	60	–43.01	43.97	261.22	
Based on the K value,
the free energy of adsorption
(ΔG0) is calculated by eq 14(43) 14  where R is the gas constant
(R = 8.314 J mol–1 K–1), and T is the temperature of the system (K).

The standard adsorption entropy (ΔS0) is calculated via the following thermodynamic eq 15(44) 15  

The standard thermodynamic parameters are collected
and given in Table 4. The positive values
of ΔH0 prove that the adsorption
of inhibitors is endothermic. When the temperature increases, the
inhibition efficiency increases. This suggests the hypothesis that
these inhibitors may take part in the chemical adsorption process
on metal surfaces.45

Besides, the
ΔG0 value also reveals
much information. ΔG0 is larger
than −20 kJ mol–1 which means there is electrostatic
interaction between the charged inhibitors and charged steel (physical
adsorption). While it is more negative than −40 kJ mol–1, the adsorption involves the charged pair or organic
inhibitor transfer onto the steel surface, resulting to form a type
of coordinated bond (chemical adsorption).9,46 In
fact, there is no boundary between physical and chemical adsorption
in which the physical one is considered as the first stage of chemical
adsorption.24 Therefore, the adsorption
of ITU and PTU on steel surfaces is a mixture of both physisorption
and chemisorption when considering the value of ΔG0. The higher the temperature, the more negative the ΔG0 value, indicating that the studied inhibitors
are more strongly linked to the steel surface. It is in a perfect
agreement with the increase of inhibition performance as the temperature increases.

At
the same temperature, the ΔG0 value
of PTU is more negative than ITU; it proves that the adsorption
of PTU on the surface of steel is stronger than that of ITU. The sign
of ΔS0 is positive, and it means
that entropy of the process increases. This process includes the adsorption
of organic compounds (Org) and the desorption of water molecules at
the electrode surface. It can be described as follows 16  where x is the number of
water molecules replaced by one inhibitor molecule. The positive values
of ΔS0 indicate that there is an
increase in chaos between reactant molecules on the metal electrode
surface. This is also an important driving force for inhibitor molecules
to adsorb onto the metal surface.47

2.3 Quantum Chemical Study
The quantum
chemical method is extremely useful to study the structure and behavior
of corrosion inhibitors.48,49 Based on the optimized
structures of PTU and ITU at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) (Figure 1), several thermodynamic parameters can be
computationally computed from Gaussian output files.

Mulliken
population analysis is used to predict the adsorption centers of inhibitors.50 The results given in Table 5 show that both sulfur and nitrogen atoms
in of PTU and ITU are the most favored sites for their adsorption
of these inhibitors onto the metal surface through a donor–acceptor
type of interaction because they are more negatively charged.18 Besides, the benzene ring in PTU is a cause
to promote the formation of the adsorbate–surface complex.51

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
can display the electron-donating
position of the molecule.52 Based on the
HOMO of PTU and ITU drawn in Figure 9, both can mainly donate electrons to the metal surface
at the S and N atoms. In contrast, the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) indicates the ability of accepting electrons of the
compound.24 The shapes of LUMOs in Figure 9 indicate that receiving
positions of PTU and ITU are identical. The most reactive LUMO sites
in PTU and ITU are at nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon atoms (nearby the
double bonds or benzene ring).

The value of EHOMO of a molecule helps
to determine its electron donating ability. A molecule with higher EHOMO can easily donate electrons to appropriate
acceptor molecules with low-energy, empty molecular orbital.52 From Table 6, the EHOMO value of PTU
(−5.84 eV) is lower than the EHOMO value of ITU (−5.50 eV) which is slightly inconsistent with
the experimental results.

The value of ELUMO represents the ability
of a molecule to accept electrons. The lower the value of ELUMO is, the easier is its ability to receive
electrons.52 Based on the calculated ELUMO values in Table 6, the inhibition efficiency can be arranged
in the order: PTU > ITU.

The absolute hardness (η)
represents the change of the chemical
potential (μ) on the total number of atoms.53 The higher the value of η is, the more the stability
of a compound is. The global softness (S) is the
quantitative characteristic of electron cloud polarization in compounds
and is opposite of the hardness.54 The
higher the energy gap (ΔEL–H) is, the less polar the molecule is, and the adsorption of this
molecule on the surface of metal is difficult.4 Hence, a good corrosion inhibitor must have low values of EL–H and η but a high value of S. Based on the calculated values in Table 6, the inhibition efficiency of PTU is better
than that of ITU. Furthermore, ΔN value of
ITU is higher than PTU. It also indicates that ITU can exchange electrons
more strongly than PTU. In short, the quantum chemical parameters
(ELUMO, ΔE, η,
σ, and ΔN) of neutral inhibitors show
good agreement with the obtained experimental results mentioned above.

It should be emphasized that both PTU and ITU are investigated
in acid solution. Therefore, these compounds may undergo protonation
at heteroatom sites (N and S). Thus, the investigation of the protonated
forms are necessary to determine the preferred form of these inhibitors
in acidic solution. The favored protonated sites are at S18, N12,
and N15 for PTU and S1, N2, and N3 for ITU.

Figure 10 shows
five protonated conformations of ITU and PTU optimized at B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
and their relative energies (in parenthesis). The most stable protonated
conformations of PTU and ITU are protonated PTU (pPTU)-S18 and protonated
ITU (pITU)-S1, respectively. (Tables S3 and S4, Supporting Information for more details). Therefore, pPTU-S18
and pITU-S1 are chosen for further computational calculations.

Figure 10 Selected
optimized structures of pPTU and pITU (data in parenthesis
are relative energies to the pPTU-S18 and pITU-S1 in kcal·mol–1).

In the case of protonated
inhibitors, the values of EHOMO(PTU) (−10.75
eV), SPTU (0.37 eV), and ΔN(PTU) (−0.20)
are higher than the values of EHOMO(ITU) (−11.64 eV), S(ITU) (0.31 eV),
and ΔN(ITU) (−0.21), respectively.
The values of ELUMO(PTU) (−5.37
eV), ΔE(L–H)(PTU) (5.37 eV),
and ηPTU (2.69 eV) are lower than the values of ELUMO(ITU) (−5.11 eV), ΔE(L–H)(ITU) (6.52 eV), and η(ITU) (3.26 eV). These parameters support that PTU is a better
inhibitor than ITU.

The EHOMO values
of protonated inhibitor
molecules in the gas phase (−10.75 and −11.64 eV) are
lower than EHOMO values of neutral ones
(−5.84 and −5.50 eV) for PTU and ITU, respectively.
It means the electron-donating ability of protonated molecules decreases.
Therefore, the bond between the inhibitor and the metal is formed
by sharing of electrons from the metal to the inhibitor (back-donation).55

In addition, the inhibition efficiency
is arranged in the same
trend as compared to the quantum chemical parameters in the gas phase
and in water (for both neutral and protonated inhibitors). All quantum
chemical parameters (EHOMO, ELUMO, ΔEL–H,
η, S, and ΔN) of protonated
molecules show good agreement with the obtained experimental results.

2.4 MC Simulations
The MC simulation
method is a useful technique for studying the adsorption of inhibitor
molecules on the metal surface. Figure 11 shows the most suitable configurations
for adsorption of PTU, ITU, and water on Fe(110) substrates, and the
detailed results are given in Table 7. Based on the images in Figure 11, it can be seen that PTU and ITU adsorb
closely and lies parallel to the Fe(110) surface. These are due to
coordinate bonds which are formed when inhibitor molecules donate
electrons to the unoccupied d-orbital of iron or accept the electrons
from iron through heteroatoms in molecules.

Figure 11 Top and side views of
the adsorption of the inhibitors on Fe(110)
surface in the gas phase: (a) PTU; (b) ITU; (c) H2O.

of Inhibitors on the Fe(110) Surface by MC Simulation

PTU/Fe(110)	–142.65	–92.47	–72.41	–20.06	
ITU/Fe(110)	–210.07	–86.26	–82.50	–3.76	
H2O/Fe(110)	–6.77	–6.80	–6.77	–0.03	
pPTU-S18/Fe(110)	–389.14	–300.99	–295.26	–5.73	
pITU-S1/Fe(110)	–454.43	–306.70	–303.52	–3.18	
In the solution, adsorption of inhibitors
on the metal surface
is a quasi-substitution process between inhibitor molecules and water
molecules. Because the adsorption energy of water is −6.80
kJ mol–1, it is smaller than that of PTU and ITU
(Table 7);water molecules
on the metal surface may be replaced easily by inhibitor molecules.
Thus, the metal surface can be protected. Besides, the adsorption
energies of PTU (−92.47 kJ mol–1), it is
more negative than that of ITU (−86.26 kJ mol–1), which shows that PTU has a stronger tendency to adsorb on the
metal surface.

To simulate the solvation conditions, fourteen
water molecules
are added (Figure 12). According to Figure 12, those pPTU and pITU molecules are adsorbed on the Fe(110)
surface through heteroatoms (nitrogen and sulfur) and aromatic ring.
This observation is also received in the case of inhibitor adsorption
in the gas phase (Figure 12). Clearly, the protonation process do not change the adsorption
configuration of studied inhibitors. However, the absolute adsorption
energies of pPTU and pITU in water are greater than their neutral
forms in gas. This increase in energy is attributed to the stabilization
role of the solvent molecules.56

3 Conclusions
Corrosion
inhibition ability of PTU and ITU have been studied by
PDP measurement, EIS, quantum chemical calculation, and MC simulations.
The factors affecting on the corrosion inhibition such as the molecular
structure, concentration, and temperature are investigated. Following
are the essential conclusions:1. PTU and ITU are the potential corrosion
inhibitors for steel in 1.0 M HCl with highest efficiencies of 98.96
and 92.65% at 60 °C, respectively. The inhibition ability of
PTU is better than that of ITU in the same condition because PTU possesses
a benzene ring in its structure.

2. The EIS results suggested that PTU
and ITU protect the mild steel corrosion due to the formation of a
protective inhibitor film at the metal–electrolyte interface.

3. The inhibition efficiency
increases
with the increase of temperature, and the inhibitors have tendency
to be more strongly linked to the metal surface. They are predicted
to participate in chemical adsorption on metal surfaces.

4. The adsorption of PTU and ITU in 1.0
M HCl obey the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

5. The corrosion inhibition ability of
PTU and ITU has been also determined via computational calculations
and MC simulations. As a result, there is a good agreement between
both experimental and theoretical results.



4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
steel specimens were
made from carbon steel, whose composition (in weight percent) is 0.28%
carbon, 1.11% manganese, 0.40% silicon, 0.03% phosphorous, 0.02% sulfur,
and iron is the remainder.

PTU and ITU were purchased from Shanghai
Dibai Chemicals Technology Co., Ltd. The concentrations of ITU and
PTU inhibitors added in 1.0 M HCl are 10–4, 5 ×
10–4, 10–3, and 5 × 10–3 M.

4.2 Electrochemical Measurements
PDP
curves were measured by the electrochemical device which was manufactured
at Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology. The details of this
device and electrodes are described in Table S5, Supporting Information.

PDP curves were measured in
four temperatures: (20 ± 1), (30 ± 1), (45 ± 1), and
(60 ± 1) °C, the potentials in the range of −0.55
to −0.50 V, a sensibility of 7, and a scanning rate of 1 mV/s.

The inhibition efficiency (IE %) of steel corrosion is calculated
via eq 17(57) 17  where iinh is
the corrosion density with the presence of the inhibitor. icorr is the corrosion density without the inhibitor.

The degree of surface coverage (θ) is generated based on eq 18(21) 18  

EIS was performed at open-circuit
potential with an alternating
current amplitude of 10 mV using a frequency region of 10 mHz to 100
Hz. The total number of points is 30. The EIS is recorded with Zahner
Zennium (R) and IM6 using the Thales 4.5 software package.

Inhibition
efficiency (IE %) is estimated by the eq 19(58) 19  where Rct (Ω
cm2) and Rct(inh) (Ω
cm2) are the charge transfer resistances in the absence
and presence of the inhibitor, respectively.

Before measuring
the polarization curves and EIS, the electrode
was immersed in test solution for 1 h to attain a stable state.

4.3 Computational Method
Quantum chemical
calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.59 The structures of all compounds in the gas phase
were optimized using the B3LYP method in combination with the basis
set of 6-311G(d,p). Quantum parameters mentioned at Section 2.2 were also obtained at the
same level of theory. 20   21   22   23  

The fractional number of electrons
transferred, ΔN, from a compound with high
potential to the one with low potential can be calculated by eq 24(60,61) 24  Here, χM and χinh are absolute electronegativity values of the metal and
inhibitor. ηM and ηinh are absolute
hardness values of the metal and inhibitor, respectively.

In
case of iron, χFe = 7 eV, ηFe =
0 eV, and ΔN can be expressed as 25  

4.4 MC Simulations
The MC simulation
using Materials Studio 6.0 software62 was
performed to examine the adsorption process of PTU and ITU on the
Fe(110) surface. The interaction between inhibitors and Fe(110) surface
was simulated in a (14.89 × 14.89 × 20.05 Å) box with
a periodic boundary size. The optimized structures of the interaction
of PTU and ITU with the Fe(110) surface were carried out using COMPASS
force field.
