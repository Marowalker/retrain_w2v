Aplyronine
A (ApA) is an antitumor marine macrolide that induces
an protein–protein interaction (PPI) between actin and tubulin.
The C1–C9 macrolactone part including the C7 N,N,O-trimethylserine (TMSer) ester
is important for its highly potent activities. To develop new antitumor
PPI inducers, four aplyronine analogues were synthesized, which bear
the C1–C9 macrolactone part with 0–2 TMSer ester(s)
and the C24–C34 actin-binding side chain. Despite exhibiting
potent actin-depolymerizing activity comparable to that of ApA, these
analogues did not show potent cytotoxicity or depolymerize microtubules.
Molecular modeling studies suggested that the whole macrolactone moiety
of aplyronines was important to fix the conformation of the C7 TMSer
ester moiety, while the linear C1–C9 part was insufficient.
Still, our study newly proposed that fixed conformations of the C7
or C9 TMSer esters in aplyronines that protrude from the actin surface
are important for binding to tubulin and inhibit microtubule dynamics.

Introduction
The manipulation of
new protein–protein interactions (PPIs)
by natural products and related small bioactive compounds has become
an important issue in the fields of basic life sciences and drug discovery.1 The use of PPI-stabilizing or -inhibiting scaffolds
has important implications for simplified mimetic design and provides
new insights into ways to design molecules that tether proteins using
different binding surfaces.2 Among a small
number of natural products that simultaneously interact with more
than one biomacromolecule, aplyronine A (ApA, 1),3−5 a 24-membered antitumor macrolide isolated from the sea hare Aplysia kurodai, promotes a unique PPI between actin
and tubulin, two of the major cytoskeletal proteins (Figure 1). ApA was originally characterized
as an actin-targeting agent that depolymerizes fibrous actin (F-actin)
and inhibits the polymerization of actin by forming a 1:1 complex
with the monomeric globular molecule (G-actin).6 While it also exhibits potent cytotoxicity against HeLa
S3, a human cervical carcinoma cell line at an IC50 of
10 pM, this concentration is much lower than that needed for disassembly
of the actin cytoskeleton (∼100 nM). We recently showed that
ApA forms a 1:1:1 heterotrimeric complex with actin and tubulin, in
association with the synergistic binding of actin to tubulin, and
inhibits tubulin polymerization.7 This
synergistic binding effect of the actin–ApA complex toward
tubulin has been supported through the use of gel-permeation HPLC,
surface plasmon resonance analysis,8 and
photolabeling and affinity pulldown experiments.9,10 Several
tubulin-targeting agents have been widely used in cancer chemotherapy.
To the best of our knowledge, however, ApA is the first microtubule
inhibitor that has been shown to have a PPI-inducing effect between
actin and tubulin to inhibit microtubule dynamics.2

Figure 1 Structures of aplyronines and their synthetic analogues.

The structure of ApA can be divided
into two characteristic parts:
the C1–C23 macrolactone with an N,N,O-trimethylserine (TMSer) ester and the
C24–C34 side chainwith an N,N-dimethylalanine (DMAla) ester, and the latter is important for actin-depolymerizing
activity.11 X-ray analysis of the actin–ApA
complex revealed that ApA intercalates into the hydrophobic cleft
between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin by using the side-chain moiety
of 1.12 The crystallographic
structures of complexes of actin with several macrolides that have
side chain(s) similar to those of ApA have also been reported, such
as kabiramide C,13 sphinxolide B,14 reidispongiolides A and C,14 and swinholide A,15 all of which
bind to actin at the same site. In fact, a synthetic ApA analogue
of the C21–C34 side-chain 4 specifically binds
to actin at the same site as aplyronines and moderately depolymerizes
F-actin.16 Meanwhile, as for the macrolactone
moiety, the presence of the C7 TMSer ester in 1 is essential
for the potent activity of ApA because aplyronine C (ApC, 3), which lacks the C7 TMSer ester, does not bind to tubulin and its
cytotoxicity is 1700 times weaker than that of 1.9b Thus, it has been suggested that the positively
charged C7 TMSer ester that protrudes from the actin–ApA complex
might generate a unique tubulin-binding site, which drives the interaction
with tubulin α/β-heterodimer.7

ApA exhibits potent antitumor activities in vivo against P388
leukemia,
Lewis lung carcinoma, and Ehrlich carcinoma.3a To develop new PPI modulators with potent biological activities,
two ApA analogues have been synthesized, which bear the whole macrolactone
moiety of ApA and the side-chain parts of mycalolide B or swinholide
A.17 Both of these “hybrid”
molecules exhibited potent actin-depolymerizing activity, and the
latter showed potent cytotoxicity and induced potent PPI between actin
and tubulin, as with ApA. Meanwhile, there have been few studies on
the structural modification and simplification of the macrolactone
moiety of aplyronines. To better understand the binding modes and
antitumor mechanism of ApA and to develop new analogues that retain
the potent PPI-inducing activity of ApA between actin and tubulin
as new drug leads, we examined here the simplification of the macrolactone
part of aplyronines.

Results and Discussion
To get perspectives
for the design of structurally simplified aplyronine
analogues, molecular modeling studies were performed. Aplyronine B
(ApB, 2) is a minute congener of ApA isolated from A. kurodai, in which the TMSer ester is migrated
from C7 to C9. It is less cytotoxic than ApA but 7- to 8-fold more
cytotoxic than ApC.3a,4c While the crystallographic structures
of complexes of ApB or ApC with actin have not been reported, they
are expected to bind to actin, similar to ApA and related actin-depolymerizing
macrolides. Thus, conformational searches for ApA and ApB bound to
actin were performed using the Amber12:EHT force-field, in which both
actin and the C24–C34 side chainwere fixed. Among the ten and
two lowest-energy conformers of ApA and ApB obtained within 30 kJ/mol,
those with the lowest energies were almost dominant (97.8 and 99.9%
occupations, respectively) (Figure 2). In the most stable conformer of ApA, the macrolide
part (C1–C23) including the C7 TMSer ester moiety almost completely
overlapped than those in the actin–ApA complex [PDB: 1WUA] [root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) 0.477 Å for all of the C, O, and N atoms of
the macrolactone part]. It was expected that our modeling studies
are applicable to precisely predict the conformations of natural and
synthetic ApA analogues on actin. In the most stable conformer of
ApB, the orientation of the macrolide part was far different from
that in the actin–ApA complex, while its C9 TMSer ester protruded
from the surface of actin, like the C7 TMSer ester of ApA. While it
is still unclear whether ApB interferes with microtubule dynamics
in association with actin like ApA, we assumed that some spatial and
conformational variance of the TMSer ester might be allowed for PPI-inducing
activity and potent cytotoxicity of aplyronines.

Figure 2 Molecular modeling studies
of aplyronines. The most stable conformers
of ApA [(a), green] and ApB [(b), cyan] on actin are shown. Conformational
searches were performed using the Amber12:EHT force-field, in which
both actin and the C24–C34 side-chain parts of aplyronines
were fixed. In each model, ApA (yellow) in the actin–ApA complex
(PDB code: 1WUA) is superimposed.

Previous structure–activity
relationship (SAR) studies showed
that the functional groups of ApA that are important for cytotoxicity
are the C7 TMSer ester, the C9 hydroxy group, and a conjugated diene
moiety on the macrolactone ring. Based on the modeling studies as
mentioned above, we designed structurally simplified ApA analogue 5, in which the C1–C9 macrolactone part was connected
with the C24–C34 side chainvia an ester bond (Figure 1). We expected that the conjugated
diene moiety in 5 would partially fix the conformation
of the linear C1–C9 part, which makes its C7 TMSer ester direct
to the desired position on the complex with actin. For reference,
we planned to synthesize ApC analogue 6, which lacks
the C7 TMSer ester of 5. We were concerned that 5 might not show potent PPI-inducing activity if the C7 TMSer
ester is tightly attached to the actin surface. For such an undesired
interaction to occur, bis-C7,C9-TMSer analogue 7 was
designed, in which either at least the C7 or C9 TMSer ester would
be apart from the surface of actin and interact with tubulin. In addition,
to simplify the synthetic pathway, symmetrical bis-C7,C7′-TMSer
analogue 8 was designed. All four aplyronine analogues
could be prepared via the esterification of C1–C9 (or C7) unsaturated
carboxylic acids with the common C23–C34 primary alcohol, followed
by regioselective esterification of the TMSer group.

First,
the C23–C34 side-chain part 16 was synthesized
(Scheme 1). A known
primary alcohol 9(18) prepared
from (S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate was converted
into the phenyl tetrazole (PT) sulfide with aryl disulfide/nBu3P, and subsequent oxidation with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) yielded
PT–sulfone 10. Julia–Kocienski olefination19 of 10 with sterically hindered
aldehyde 11(4c) and lithium
hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS) as a base in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)20 at temperatures of −55 °C to room
temperature afforded an olefin quantitatively (E/Z = 1:2). Simultaneous catalytic hydrogenation of the olefin
and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl group using palladium(II) hydroxide
on carbon resulted in the epimerization of C29 secondary alcohol.
Thus, removal of the benzyl group with calcium-mediated Birch reduction
and selective protection of the primary alcohol with a tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) group gave silyl ether 12. Catalytic hydrogenation of the olefin with Pd(OH)2 on
carbon, condensation with N,N-dimethyl-l-alanine, acidic hydrolysis of the C34 methyl acetal, and reduction
of the hemiacetal using sodium borohydride afforded diol 13. Trityl group (Tr) protection of the primary alcohol and subsequent
acetylation of the remaining C31 secondary alcohol gave acetate 14. Removal of the Tr group with formic acid in ether and
oxidation of the primary alcohol with Dess–Martin periodinane21 provided aldehyde 15. Finally,
dehydrating condensation with N-methylformamide under
acidic conditions and selective deprotection of the TBDPS group with
ammonium fluoride furnished compound 16.

We next set out to synthesize three kinds of unsaturated
carboxylic
acids, which correspond to the C1–C9 or C1–C7 macrolactone
part of aplyronines (Scheme 2). Homoallylic alcohol 17,22 prepared from methyl (S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate
using Hosomi–Sakurai allylation23 as a key step, was converted to the diol by calcium-mediated Birch
reduction. Subsequent acetonide protection of the 1,3-diol, Lemieux–Johnson
oxidation of the terminal olefin,24 and
Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction of the aldehyde with
triethyl 4-phosphonocrotonate gave conjugated ester 18 with high stereoselectivity (4E/4Z = 10:1). Next, removal of the acetonide group under acidic conditions
and selective protection of the primary alcohol with a TBDPS group
gave mono-silyl ether 19. To prepare the ApA and ApC
analogues 5 and 6 having or lacking the
C7 TMSer ester, the C7 hydroxy group was protected with a methylthiomethyl
(MTM) ether using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/Ac2O/AcOH25 or a tert-butyldimethylsilyl
(TBS) ether. Hydrolysis of the ethyl esters under mild conditions
using lithium hydroxide provided MTM- and TBS-protected unsaturated
carboxylic acids 20 and 21. Similarly, another
unsaturated carboxylic acid 23 having the bis-C7,C7′-TBS
ether was synthesized from a known aldehyde 22(26) in 2 steps.

With the side-chain and the linear C1–C9 (or C1–C7)
macrolactone parts in hand, we examined the synthesis of aplyronine
analogues 5–8 (Scheme 3). Condensation of the side-chain part 16 with carboxylic acid 20 using the procedure
of Yamaguchi et al.27 and removal of the
MTM group by silver(I) nitrate yielded C7-hydroxy ester 24. Condensation of the secondary alcohol with N,N,O-trimethyl-l-serine and removal
of the two silyl groups at C9 and C25 by the hydrogen fluoride–pyridine
(HF·py) complex furnished ApA analogue 5. Also,
direct removal of the two silyl groups in 24 yielded
the corresponding ApC analogue 6 (32% in 5 steps from 19). Because of the low efficiency of the protection/deprotection
sequence using an MTM group, we also examined the condensation of 16 with the TBS-protected carboxylic acid 21.
Subsequent removal of three silyl groups by HF·py complex at
once afforded 6 in a more efficient manner (57% in 4
steps from 19). To our delight, chemoselective condensation
at the C7 and C9 hydroxy groups in 6 with N,N,O-trimethyl-l-serine
selectively provided bis-C7,C9-TMSer analogue 7, due
to the structural hindrance at the C25 secondary alcohol. Finally,
condensation of 16 with carboxylic acid 23 followed by the removal of three TBS groups gave triol 25, which was converted to bis-C7,C7′-TMSer analogue 8 as in the case with 7.

2,4,6-trichlorobenzoyl chloride, Et3N, THF, then 16, DMAP,

(d) HF·pyridine, pyridine, THF (5:3:7).

The biological activities of aplyronine analogues 5–8 were compared to those of natural ApA. For the in vitro F-actin
sedimentation assay, an ultracentrifugation method was used, which
is applicable for various actin-targeting agents and their fluorescent,
photoreactive, and other derivatives.9a,28 The amount
of F-actin (3 μM as monomer) in the precipitate (P) fraction
was reduced by treatment with ApA in a dose-dependent manner, and
the protein bands were observed almost entirely in the supernatant
(S) fraction at 5 μM, as with the G-actin (Figure 3a, far left, without Mg2+). The EC50 of ApA was 1.4 μM against 3
μM actin, which well coincided with those by a pyrene-labeled
(pyrenyl) actin method (EC50 1.3–1.6 μM against
3–3.7 μM actin)17 (Table 1). Similarly, four
aplyronine analogues 5–8 showed significant actin-depolymerizing
activities, with EC50 values of <5, <5, 2.1, and
1.3 μM against 3 μM actin, respectively, all of which
were stronger than that of the C21–C34 side-chain analogue 4 (EC50 7.9 μM against 3.7 μM actin,
20% residual activity of ApA).16a

with CBB stain.

The PPI-inducing effects of aplyronine analogues between
actin
and tubulin were then examined by using a similar ultracentrifugation
method. ApA (8.5 μM) specifically induced microtubule disassembly
in the presence of actin (3 μM for monomers), and both of these
proteins were dominantly detected in the S fraction (Figure 3b).8 Meanwhile, even at the highest available concentrations of ApA analogue 5 (27 μM) and bis-TMSer analogues 7 and 8 (85 μM each), most of the tubulin remained in the
P fractions (ca. 96.8, 87.8, and 92.1%), while substantial actin was
moved to the S fractions (ca. 66.9, 84.9, and 87.0%). These results
suggested that compounds 5, 7, and 8 scarcely depolymerized microtubules synergistically with
actin, similar to ApC.7

As for cytotoxicity,
four aplyronine analogues 5–8 all moderately inhibited
the proliferation of HeLa S3, a human cervical
carcinoma cell line (IC50 1.1–1.9 μM) (Table 1). ApA analogue 5 was >13 times more cytotoxic than side-chain analogue 4, but 140 000- and 82-fold less cytotoxic than natural ApA
and ApC, respectively. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of compounds 5 and 6 were almost the same, which did not reflect
the significant difference in the cytotoxicity of natural aplyronines.
Previous studies showed that fluorescent aplyronine derivatives, for
example, those conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine, are rapidly accumulated
in the cytoplasm and cause rapid disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton
in HeLa S3 cells, and thus natural aplyronines are highly cell-permeable.28 However, it is likely that the cell-permeability
of the four aplyronine analogues 5–8 is very low,
as is that of the side-chain analogue 4, and the presence
of positively charged TMSer and/or DMAla esters contributed little
to their potent cytotoxicities. As a result, an ApA analogue 5 and bis-TMSer analogues 7 and 8 were unable to induce PPIs between actin and tubulin either in vitro
or in cells. Still, however, the C1–C9 part in 5–8 might contribute to the potentiation of actin-depolymerizing activity
and cytotoxicity of the C24–C34 side chainby enhancing the
interaction with actin.

To consider why synthetic aplyronine
analogues 5, 7, and 8 did not
show significant PPI-inducing
effects between actin and tubulin, molecular modeling studies were
performed, in which both actin and the C24–C34 side chainwere
fixed. Among the 17 lowest-energy conformers of 5 on
actin obtained within 30 kJ/mol, that with the lowest energy accounted
for a relatively high proportion (90.3% occupation) (Figure 4a). However, the C1–C9
moiety of the most stable conformer of 5 had a far different
conformation from that of ApA (rmsd 4.978 Å for all of the C,
O, and N atoms of the C1–C9 part) due to the hydrogen bond
between the methoxy group of the C7 TMSer ester and the carboxyl group
of Asp25 (Figure 4b),
which was not observed in the original actin–ApA complex. In
contrast, the C1–C9 moiety of the fourth stable conformer of 5 (ΔE +11.9 kJ/mol, 0.7% occupation)
well coincided with that of ApA (rmsd 0.865 Å for all of the
C, O, and N atoms of the C1–C9 part) (Figure 4c), in which the C7 TMSer ester protruded
from the actin surface, and the C9 hydroxy group directly interacted
with the carboxyl group of Glu334 (Figure 4d). Due to such a low proportion of the desired
conformation on actin, however, ApA analogue 5 might
be unable to interact with tubulin.

analogues of aplyronines.
Conformational searches were performed as mentioned in Figure 2. (a–d) The most stable
(green) and 4th stable (cyan, ΔE +11.9 kJ/mol)

respectively. (e,f) The most stable conformers of bis-TMSer ester

actin. (g) The actin–ApA complex viewed from the bottom of
the macrolide moiety. The Arg147 residue that interacts with the C13–OMe
group is shown as a sphere model.

As for the bis-TMSer analogues 7 and 8, 46 and 54 lowest-energy conformers were obtained within 30 kJ/mol.
The most stable conformers of 7 and 8 accounted
for 89.1 and 71.9%, respectively, and both of their C7 TMSer esters
interacted with Asp25, as with 5. While the additional
C9 TMSer ester in 7 did not attach to the actin surface,
its orientation was far different from those of ApA and ApB models
(Figure 4e). In addition,
the second C7′ TMSer ester in 8 was still tightly
bound to actin (Figure 4f). These undesired major conformations of bis-TMSer esters might
explain why 7 and 8 did not exhibit significant
PPI-inducing activities.

We considered again the conformation
of ApA on actin, and the C13
methoxy group interacts with Arg147 via water molecules in addition
to direct interaction of the C9 hydroxy group with Glu334 (Figure 4g). While the conformation
of the macrolactone moiety of ApB on actin was far different from
that of ApA, its C13 methoxy group was close to Arg147 based on the
similar hydrogen bonds with that of the actin–ApA complex (Figure 2b). These results
suggested that such multiple hydrogen bonds might be essential to
restrict the conformation of the macrolactone moiety of aplyronines
and that the linear C1–C9 macrolactone part was insufficient
to enable the C7 or C9 TMSer esters to protrude from the actin surface
to bind to tubulin, like natural ApA and ApB, and interfere with microtubule
dynamics in association with actin.

Conclusions
For
the development of new molecules to regulate PPI between actin
and tubulin, four aplyronine analogues, which bear the C1–C9
macrolactone part with 0–2 TMSer ester(s) and the C24–C34
actin-binding side chain, were synthesized with the aid of molecular
modeling studies. Despite their actin-depolymerizing activity comparable
to that of ApA, these aplyronine analogues did not show significant
PPI-inducing effects. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the
whole C1–C23 macrolactone moiety of aplyronines was important
to fix the conformation of the C7 TMSer ester to interact with tubulin.
As a result, our synthesized analogues were oversimplified, and the
linear C1–C9 macrolactone and the C24–C34 side-chain
parts of aplyronines were insufficient for both tubulin recruitment
and potent cytotoxicity. Still, our SAR and molecular modeling studies
newly proposed that the C7 or C9 TMSer esters in aplyronines A and
B that protruded from the actin surface are important for their potent
activities, which are superior to those of other agents that merely
target actin, from the viewpoint of antitumor drug discovery and development.
Actin is the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells and is essential
for the regulation of various cellular functions, such as cell division
and tumor migration. It is possible that actin-targeting agents interact
with various cellular targets via unknown PPIs.2 Thus, the results of this study have potential in the design
and development of newly classified PPI modulators as pharmacological
tools and therapeutic agents. Further investigations on the mechanisms
of action of aplyronines and the development of new PPI-regulating
molecules inspired by diverse actin-targeting natural products are
currently underway.

Experimental Sections
General Information

unless otherwise noted. Organic solvents and reagents for moisture-sensitive
reactions were distilled by the standard procedure. Anhydrous CH2Cl2, tetrahydrofuran (THF), DME, benzene, pyridine,
DMSO, and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) were obtained commercially. Column chromatography was performed
using silica gel BW-820MH or FL60D (75–200 or 45–75
μm, Fuji Silysia Co., Aichi, Japan) or a Yamazen preparative
silica gel (40 μm). All moisture-sensitive reactions were performed
under an atmosphere of argon or nitrogen, and the starting materials
were azeotropically dried with benzene before use. Merck precoated
silica gel 60 F254 plates were used for thin layer chromatography.

BioSpin AVANCE 600 spectrometer (600 MHz for 1H and 150
MHz for 13C) or AVANCE 400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C). Chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million (ppm) with coupling constants (J) in hertz relative to the solvent peaks, δH 7.26

DMSO at 1–10 mM. The cytotoxicity of ApA and its derivatives
was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) method.29 In brief, HeLa
S3 cells were seeded at 2 × 103 cells per well in
96-well plates. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, aplyronines
(1 pM to 1 mM) were added, and the cells were incubated for 96 h at
37 °C. A 1.4 mg/mL MTT solution in phosphate buffer saline (50
μL) was added to the cells. After 4 h, the culture medium was
removed and the formazan product was dissolved in DMSO (150 μL).
Optical density at 540 nm was measured with a TECAN microplate reader
(Infinite 200 Pro). All assays were performed in duplicate to confirm
reproducibility.

Molecular Modeling
Studies
Molecular modeling studies
were performed using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2014.09
program package (Chemical Computing Group, Inc.), as described previously.10,30 For docking model studies, all water molecules associated with the
actin–ApA complex (PDB: 1WUA) were removed, except for those near
the ligand, and all protons on the protein and the ligand were complemented.
Conformational searches were performed using the Amber12:EHT force-field
with GB/VI Generalized Born31 implicit
solvent electrostatics (Din = 1, Dout = 80) and with LowModeMD,32 in which both the actin and the side-chain moiety (C23–C34)
of aplyronines and their synthetic analogues were fixed.

ApA Analogue 5
TMSer ester 24a (1.2 mg, 1.0 μmol) was
dissolved in a 5:3:7 mixture of hydrogen
fluoride pyridine, pyridine, and dry THF (0.5 mL) at 0 °C. After
being stirred for 18 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was
poured into sat. NaHCO3 aq (2 mL) at 0 °C and extracted
with EtOAc (2 mL × 4). The combined extracts were washed with
brine, dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated.
The crude material was purified with SiO2 column chromatography
(FL60D 0.5 g, CHCl3/acetone = 1/0, 10/1 to 0/1) to give
ApA analogue 5 (0.4 mg, 50%) as a colorless oil. For
bioassay, a part of the sample was further purified with reversed-phase
HPLC [Develosil ODS-HG-5 (ϕ 20 × 250 mm), MeOH/20 mM aq
NH4OAc (74/26), 5 mL/min, UV254 nm, tR 31.3–35.3 min]. As with previous synthetic studies
of aplyronines,4 epimerization of the TMSer
ester moiety was observed during condensation. While compound 5 was separable as a mixture of two stereoisomers by reversed-phase
HPLC, bioassays were carried out with a mixture of four stereoisomers. 5: Rf = 0.05 (1:1 CHCl3/acetone); 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ

of 6 was the mono-C9-TMSer ester (ca. 40% yield). Analogue 6 was obtained as a mixture of stereoisomers at the C7 TMSer
and C29 DMAla ester moieties and was not separable by reversed-phase
