S100A3 protein, a member of the EF-hand-type
Ca2+-binding
S100 protein family, undergoes a Ca2+-/Zn2+-induced
structural change to a tetrameric state upon specific citrullination
of R51 in human hair cuticular cells. To elucidate the underlying
mechanism, we prepared recombinant mutant S100A3 proteins, including
R51A, R51C, R51E, R51K, and R51Q, as potential models of post-translationally
modified S100A3 and evaluated their biophysical and biochemical properties
relative to wild-type (WT) S100A3 and WT citrullinated in vitro. Size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that R51Q formed a tetramer
in the presence of Ca2+, while Ca2+ titration
monitored by Trp fluorescence indicated that R51Q had Ca2+-binding properties similar to those of citrullinated S1003A. We
therefore concluded that R51Q is the optimal mutant model of post-translationally
modified S100A3. We compared the solution structure of WT S100A3 and
the R51Q mutant in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and
Zn2+ by SEC-small-angle X-ray scattering. The radius of
gyration of R51Q in the metal-free state was almost the same as that
of WT; however, it increased by ∼1.5-fold in the presence of
Ca2+/Zn2+, indicating a large expansion in molecular
size. By contrast, addition of Ca2+/Zn2+ to
WT led to nonspecific aggregation in SEC analysis and dynamic light
scattering, suggesting that citrullination of S100A3 is essential
for stabilization of the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound state.
These findings will lead to the further development of structural
analyses for the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound S100A3.

==== Body
Introduction
The S100 protein family,
with more than 20 members, constitutes
the largest subfamily of EF-hand-type Ca2+-binding proteins.1 S100 proteins are characterized by their N-terminal
S100 protein-specific and C-terminal canonical Ca2+-binding
loops.2,3 In addition, some S100 proteins have been
reported to bind other divalent cations, such as Zn2+ and
Cu2+.4−10 Whereas most family members are noncovalently linked to form homo-
or heterodimers, some S100 proteins form assemblies of tetramers or
higher-order oligomers that undergo structural changes upon binding
of divalent cations such as Ca2+.11−17

S100 proteins are expressed in various tissues, and some are
distributed
in human hair follicles.18 For example,
S100A3 is highly expressed in human hair follicles and retained in
hair cuticular cells.19,20 Although S100A3 has recently
been reported to interact with the retinoid receptor,21 its functional role in hair cuticular cells remains to
be clarified. S100A3 consists of 101 amino acids, including four arginine
residues (R3, R22, R51, and R77) per monomer.22 These arginine residues in S100A3 are converted to citrulline by
peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) that are coexpressed in the hair
follicle.23 Citrullination alters both
intramolecular and intermolecular ionic and/or hydrophobic interactions
and is involved in various physiological functions.24 In particular, R51 of S100A3 is selectively citrullinated
by the isozyme PAD type III (PAD3) that is colocalized with S100A3
in hair cuticle cells. Upon citrullination, the binding affinity of
S100A3 for Ca2+ and Zn2+ increases cooperatively.

Although S100A3 is usually present as a dimer, it has been suggested
that PAD3-mediated citrullination of R51 in the S100A3 dimer causes
concomitant Ca2+-dependent assembly to a homotetramer.25 It has been also reported that there is a correlation
between hair damage and citrullination of S100A3.26 That study suggested that structural changes associated
with citrullination of S100A3 have an important role in the maturation
of hair cuticles.26 Interestingly, it has
been revealed that S100A3 and PAD3 are evolutionally related to the
emergence of mammalian hair.27

In
the present study, therefore, we have used structural biology
techniques to investigate the mechanism underlying the increased affinity
for Ca2+ and Zn2+ and the conformational change
of S100A3 that follows citrullination by PAD3. Although the dimeric
structure of S100A3 without metal ions has been reported,4,28 the structure of the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound citrullinated
S100A3 homotetramer has not been clarified in detail for two reasons:
it is ethically difficult to obtain large quantities of the citrullinated
form of S100A3 from human tissues; and in vitro modification of S100A3
by PAD3 will mainly convert R51, but it may also partially convert
other arginine residues to citrulline.23 For this reason, the highly homogeneous citrullinated form of S100A3
is difficult to prepare in large quantities. We therefore decided
to use an artificial model of post-translationally modified S100A3.

Because there is no codon for citrulline, it is difficult to prepare
citrullinated proteins by current genetic technology. Therefore, we
prepared R51-substituted mutants as mimics of citrullinated S100A3.
Based on a previous investigation of the citrullination of myelin
basic protein (MBP) by PAD,29 in which
arginine residues were converted to glutamine, which is structurally
similar to citrulline, we first prepared an R51Q variant. For comparison,
we also prepared R51 variants substituted with noncharged alanine
(R51A), cysteine with a thiol group (R51C), negatively charged glutamic
acid (R51E), positively charged lysine (R51K), and hydrophobic leucine
(R51L). To verify which mutant provided the best mimic of S100A3 citrullinated
by PAD3, we compared the biophysical and biochemical properties of
wild-type (WT) S100A3, the citrullinated form, and the mutated proteins.
In addition, we analyzed the solution structure of WT and R51Q as
a mimic of citrullinated S100A3 by using small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and/or Zn2+.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Recombinant S100A3 Samples
We expressed
the recombinant WT and mutant S100A3 proteins in the Escherichia coli SHuffle T7 strain. For WT, approximately
∼27 g of cells was harvested from a culture grown in 4 L of
Luria–Bertani (LB) medium, and ∼1.2 mg of the recombinant
protein was purified from these cells. The purity of S100A3 after
each chromatographic step was confirmed by using 15% N-[tris(hydroxylmethyl)-methyl]glycine (Tricine) sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The S100A3 mutants were
expressed and purified by the same procedure used for WT. The R51A,
R51C, and R51E mutants were obtained at a yield of ∼1.1 mg
and R51K and R51Q at ∼2.6 and ∼4.0 mg, respectively.
Unfortunately, the amount of R51L mutant obtained was too small to
be used in subsequent experiments. Post-translationally citrullinated
S100A3 was prepared by a reaction with PAD3 in vitro. Approximately
0.6 mg of the citrullinated form (hereafter R51Z) of S100A3 was obtained
by reacting 1.2 mg of WT S100A3 with 0.25 mg PAD3.

Comparison
of Ca2+/Zn2+-Dependent Tetramerization
of S100A3 Evaluated by SEC
To confirm whether the tetramerization
of S100A3 is dependent on the presence or absence of metal ions, SEC
analysis of the protein was performed in solution with and without
Ca2+ and/or Zn2+. In the absence of metal ions,
a clear single peak of absorption at 280 nm was detected in SEC analysis
(Figure 1A). Previous
studies have reported that, in the absence of Ca2+ or Zn2+, citrullinated S100A3 exists as a dimer in both crystal
and solution structures.4,25,28 Therefore, we assumed that the detected single peak, which eluted
earlier than chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) in the absence of Ca2+ and Zn2+, corresponds to dimeric S100A3. The
reason why the S100A3 dimer, which has a molecular mass of ∼24
kDa, seemed larger than 25 kDa (chymotrypsinogen A) in SEC might be
explained by the molecular shape of S100A3, which is not a standard
sphere but rather a hemispheric structure.

of S100A3. WT, R51Z, and various mutants (0.1 mM each) premixed in
elution buffer or elution buffer containing 5.0 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 were loaded on a Superdex
75 10/300 GL column for SEC analysis. (A) Metal-free elution profile.
(B) 5.0 mM Ca2+ elution profile. (C) 5.0 mM Ca2+ plus 0.1 mM Zn2+ elution profile. d indicates
the elution profile of dimeric WT. t indicates the
elution profile of putative tetrameric R51Z. Arrows indicate the elution
volume of ovalbumin (43 kDa) and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) standards.

In the absence of Ca2+ and Zn2+, the peak
positions of R51E, R51K, R51Q, and citrullinated S100A3 (R51Z) differed
slightly from that of WT in the SEC analysis. Among these mutants,
R51E and R51Q were detected at an elution volume similar to that of
R51Z (Figure 1A). In
the presence of Ca2+ alone (Figure 1B) or Ca2+ and Zn2+ (Figure 1C), more
than half of R51Z was present as the tetramer, whereas the majority
of WT remained as the dimer. The ratio of tetramerization of R51Q
was similar to that of R51Z (Figure 1B,C). The tetramerization state of R51E was different
from that of R51Z: in the presence of Ca2+/Zn2+, most of the R51E formed a tetramer (Figure 1C). The elution profile of Ca2+/Zn2+-loaded R51C was clearly different from that of WT
and R51Z, with a blurred elution peak (Figure 1C). This suggested that the oligomerization
of R51C differed from that of WT S100A3. Collectively, the results
of SEC analysis suggest that the oligomeric state of R51Q is very
similar to that of R51Z in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ and/or Zn2+.

Comparison of Ca2+-Binding Affinity by Using Trp
Fluorescence Titration
The single Trp residue (Trp45) in
S100A3, which is located between helix II and helix III,28 has the ability to emit fluorescence when excited,
and the intensity of this fluorescence is sensitive to the hydrophobic
environment around the Trp residue. It is assumed that helix III undergoes
a substantial reorientation upon Ca2+-binding to S100A3;11−17 thus, Trp45 fluorescence has previously been used to monitor Ca2+-binding and the concomitant large conformational change
of S100A3.30

Observation of Trp fluorescence
showed that the conformation of R51Z and the mutated S100A3 proteins
clearly changed at lower Ca2+ concentrations as compared
with WT (Figure 2).
In other words, R51Z and the mutated S100A3 proteins had higher Ca2+-binding affinities relative to WT S100A3. The shapes of
the Ca2+ titration curves for R51A, R51C, and R51Q were
similar to that for R51Z, whereas those for R51K and R51E were different
from those for WT and R51Z (Figure 2). This implies that R51K and R51E bind Ca2+ but undergo structural changes that are significantly different
from those of R51Z, R51C, R51Q, and R51A. Furthermore, the titration
curves indicated that the Ca2+-binding affinity of R51A
and R51C was higher than that of WT but lower than that of R51Z. The
titration curve of R51Q showed a substantial overlap with R51Z, suggesting
that R51Q has almost the same Ca2+-binding properties as
R51Z and also that the Ca2+-binding affinity of R51Q is
almost the same as that of R51Z.

Figure 2 Fluorescence titration curves of Ca2+-induced conformational
changes. The fluorescence intensities of WT, R51Z, and mutated S100A3
proteins (2 μM each) were recorded in the presence of increasing
Ca2+ concentration. The maximum fluorescence reduction
(100%) was defined as the reduction observed on the addition of 100
mM CaCl2. Each plot represents the mean value of five independent
experiments.

Comparison of Zn2+-Binding Affinity by Using Circular
Dichroism (CD) Spectrometry
It is well known that S100A3 changes the secondary structure, expected to helix IV, in a Zn2+-dependent manner.4 To evaluate
Zn2+-binding affinity of S100A3, we utilized far-ultraviolet
circular dichroism (UV CD) spectrometry to analyze secondary structural
changes of WT, R51Z, and mutated S100A3 proteins loaded with Zn2+ (Figure 3). The observed secondary structure of S100A3
showed that R51Z and the mutated S100A3 proteins, except for R51K,
significantly changed at the same Zn2+ concentrations as
compared with WT (Figure 3). Although the secondary structures of WT and R51Z (Figure 3A,B) in the presence
of 0.5 molar equivalent Zn2+ were not much changed from
the metal-free form, all of the mutated S100A3 showed a change in
the secondary structure (Figure 3C–G). Among the mutants, R51Q showed the smallest
change in the secondary structure at 0.5 molar equivalent Zn2+ as compared with the metal-free form (Figure 3G). Additionally, the profile of R51Q by
Zn2+ titration was very similar to that of R51Z. These
are significantly different from that for WT. As a consequence, it
is suggested that the structural change of R51Q is the most similar
to that of R51Z when Zn2+ is bound (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Reduction of the α-helix content in S100A3. The far-UV CD spectra
show the secondary structural changes of (A) WT, (B) R51Z, and mutated
S100A3 [(C) R51A, (D) R51C, (E) R51E, (F) R51K, and (G) R51Q]. Also
seen are the far-UV CD spectra recorded after cumulative addition
of Zn2+. The concentration of proteins was 15 μM
in all of the cases. The secondary structure of S100A3 was analyzed
to a concentration of 4 molar equivalent Zn2+.

The calculated α-helix contents of WT, R51Z, and the
mutated
S100A3 are described in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information. The α-helix content of WT (52.5%) was
roughly consistent with that of the crystal structures (55%; PDB code: 3NSI for WT). R51Z and
the mutated S100A3 proteins, except for R51K, did not show large fluctuations
in α-helix contents by citrullination and site-directed mutagenesis
of R51. By contrast, the α-helix content of R51K was apparently
different from that of WT, R51Z, and the other mutated S100A3 proteins
(Figure 3A,B,F, and
Supporting Information Table S1). The far-UV
CD spectra of R51K showed a much lower α-helix content as compared
with that of R51Z. This indicates that R51K is unsuitable for a model
of R51Z.

Collectively, the results of SEC analysis (Figure 1), Trp fluorescence
titration (Figure 2), and CD spectrometry (Figure 3) suggest that the
optimal mutant for use as a model of the citrullinated S100A3 is R51Q.

Determination of an Appropriate Mimic of Post-Translationally
Modified S100A3
A previous study on the citrullination of
recombinant murine MBP demonstrated that the genetic substitution
of arginine by glutamine had a similar effect on the MBP structure
and function as enzymatic deimination of arginine to citrulline.29 That investigation indicated that a mutant protein
containing glutamine instead of citrulline was effective as a mimic.
In the present study, we also tried to identify an appropriate mimic
for citrullinated S100A3. The above comparison of the biophysical
and biochemical properties of the S100A3 mutants, WT, and post-translationally
citrullinated S100A3 indicated that R51Q shows the most similar Ca2+-binding, Zn2+-binding, and Ca2+-/Zn2+-dependent tetramerization properties to those of R51Z. Considering
only the surface charge of the protein, however, it might be assumed
that R51A would be appropriate as a model of the S100A3 protein citrullinated
by PAD3. Indeed, a previous study reported R51A as pseudo-citrullinated
S100A3 based on the results of Trp fluorescence titration and SEC
analysis, which demonstrated that, under the same Ca2+-conditions,
R51A shows similar Ca2+-binding and tetramerization properties
to those of R51Z. However, the present results indicated that R51Q
is more suitable as a model of citrullinated S100A3 than R51A, suggesting
that not only the surface charge but also the conformation and size
of the side chains are important factors in determining an appropriate
mimic. To confirm this hypothesis, structural information on the S100A3
tetramer at the atomic level will be required.

To evaluate in
more detail whether R51Q is suitable as a model of R51Z, we conducted
Ca2+-titration by using Trp fluorescence in the presence
of Zn2+ (Figure 4A,C,E). In addition, Zn2+-titration in the presence
of Ca2+ was carried out and analyzed by utilizing far-UV
CD spectrometry for WT, R51Z, and R51Q (Figure 4B,D,F). All of the three proteins showed
significant increase of the Ca2+-binding affinity (Figure 4A,C,E). However,
WT showed 1 order lower Ca2+-binding affinity than R51Z
and R51Q. In the presence of Ca2+, R51Z and R51Q showed
almost the same changes in the secondary structure by Zn2+-titration (Figure 4D,F). These results support the fact that R51Q is suitable for the
model of R51Z. The α-helix contents calculated based on these
spectra are listed in Table S2 in the Supporting
Information.

“Metal free” showed CD spectra in the absence of Ca2+ and Zn2+, and “0” showed CD spectra
in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ and in the absence of Zn2+.

In terms of the production of
recombinant S100A3 in the SHuffle
T7 strain, the yield of WT was only ∼1.2 mg from cells cultured
in 4 L of LB medium. After reaction with PAD3 in vitro, the yield of S100A3 was reduced to approximately half (∼0.6
mg). By contrast, the yield of R51Q under the same conditions was
∼4.0 mg (i.e., approximately 3–4-fold more abundant
than WT). Among the mutants prepared in the study, R51Q was obtained
in the highest yield and was found to be the optimal model mutant
for use as citrullinated S100A3. This artificial protein will be suitable
for further structural biological analyses, which generally require
a large quantity of the protein sample. Taking all of the observations
together, we concluded that the R51Q S100A3 protein is the best model
of WT S100A3 that has been post-translationally citrullinated by PAD3.

Ca2+-/Zn2+-Dependent Oligomerization of
S100A3 Validated Using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Based
on the above findings, we further examined changes in the molecular
diameters of WT, R51Z, and R51Q in the absence or presence of Ca2+/Zn2+ using dynamic light scattering (DLS). In
the metal-free state, the diameter of all samples at 0.5 mM was approximately
40 Å. Thus, the molecular diameter of S100A3 was not altered
by replacement of R51 with citrulline or glutamine residues. In the
presence of Ca2+/Zn2+, however, the protein
samples showed significant differences. The molecular diameter of
WT increased to approximately 600 Å in 1.0 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 (Figure 5A), and the Ca2+-/Zn2+-loaded WT sample was precipitated during measurement. By contrast,
in the presence of a low concentration of Ca2+ (less than
1.0 mM) at 1 molar equivalent of Zn2+, no significant changes
in the molecular diameter of WT were observed (Figure S1A in the Supporting Information). Previous experiments
have shown that S100A3 at concentrations higher than 0.4 mM is often
precipitated after the addition of Ca2+/Zn2+. (The concentrations of the S100A3 protein used in the SEC and Trp
fluorescence titration were lower at 100 μM and 2 μM,
respectively.) This aggregation probably results from nonspecific
binding of Ca2+ and Zn2+ at high sample concentrations.

Figure 5 DLS analysis
of changes in the molecular diameters of WT, R51Z,
and R51Q S100A3 (0.5 mM each) in the absence or presence of Ca2+/Zn2+. Each peak represents the mean value obtained
from 10 independent experiments. (A) Molecular diameter of WT increased
significantly after the addition of 1 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM
Zn2+. (B, C) Molecular diameters of R51Z (B) and R51Q (C)
increased approximately 1.5-fold after the addition of 2 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Zn2+.

In contrast to WT, the molecular diameter of R51Z did not change
and no precipitation occurred in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 (data not shown). On
the other hand, the molecular diameter of R51Z increased to approximately
57 Å in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM Zn(CH3COO)2, (Figure 5B). Similarly, the molecular diameter of R51Q increased
to approximately 61 Å in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM Zn(CH3COO)2 (Figure 5C). The difference between the diameters
of R51Z and R51Q was within the range of measurement error. Thus,
the molecular diameter of R51Q was almost the same as that of R51Z
at the same Ca2+ and Zn2+ concentrations. Collectively,
these results suggested that binding of Ca2+ and Zn2+ to S100A3 and tetramerization were stabilized by either
citrullination of R51 or its mutation to glutamine.

Furthermore,
we analyzed the molecular diameters of R51Z and R51Q
with various concentrations of Ca2+ utilizing DLS. As a
result, although R51Z and R51Q in the presence of Ca2+ showed
small changes in the molecular diameter compared with the metal-free
forms, the diameters did not increase to more than 55 Å (Figure S1B,C in the Supporting Information).
Considering these results, efficient tetramerization of R51Z and R51Q
did not occur when binding Ca2+ alone. Although the structures
of R51Z and R51Q were changed by Ca2+-binding, the tetramer
was not stabilized. Therefore, it is presumed that both Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding to S100A3 is suggested to be required
to stabilize the tetramer.

Solution Scattering Profile of Ca2+-/Zn2+-Binding S100A3 Using SEC-SAXS
We performed
SEC-SAXS measurements
to elucidate the solution structure of the R51Q mutant, which was
determined as the best model of S100A3 that has been post-translationally
citrullinated by PAD3. The chromatogram of forward scattering intensities, I(0), of the metal-free R51Q mutant showed a single peak,
and the radius of gyration was almost constant (Figure 6A), indicating that the metal-free R51Q solution
was monodisperse. Figure 6B shows that the scattering profile of metal-free WT (blue
line) was well superimposed on that of R51Q (black line), indicating
that the solution structure of S100A3 was not changed by the mutation
of R51 to glutamine. Furthermore, the theoretical scattering profile
calculated from the WT crystal structure (PDB ID: 3NSI; red line) was identical
to the experimental scattering of the R51Q mutant, indicating that
the solution structure of the dimer of the S100A3 protein is essentially
the same as the crystal structure.

metal-free WT and metal-free R51Q, respectively. The red line shows
the theoretical scattering profile of (PDB ID: 3NSI) determined by CRYSOL.
The χ2 value is 0.925.

Next, SEC-SAXS analysis of the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound
S100A3 proteins was carried out. As described above for DLS,
addition of Ca2+/Zn2+ to high concentrations
of the WT sample led to precipitation. Therefore, Ca2+-/Zn2+-loaded samples were diluted to 0.23 mg/mL (20 μM)
in the buffer containing 50 mM tris-(hydroxy-methyl)aminomethane (Tris)–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2.5 mM
CaCl2, and 20 μM Zn(CH3COO)2 and then concentrated to 5.8 mg/mL, which solved the problem of
aggregation. The chromatogram of I(0) showed a minor
shoulder to the left of the major peak (Figure 7A). To avoid this minor component, the right
side of the major peak was selected as the region for extrapolation
to infinite dilution of the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound
protein. Figure 7B
shows the dimensionless Kratky plots of metal-free (black line) and
Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound (red line) R51Q. Addition of
Ca2+/Zn2 led to a drastic change in the scattering
profile of R51Q. The Rg value calculated
from Guinier analysis increased from 19.0 ± 0.4 to 30.3 ±
1.4 Å, and the bell-shaped peak of Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound R51Q was shifted to high Q × Rg as compared with the metal-free R51Q, indicating
that the size of R51Q was enlarged by binding Ca2+/Zn2+.

and red lines show metal-free and Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound R51Q, respectively.

Evaluation of the Solution Structure of S100A3
In this
study, we used a series of biophysical analyses to evaluate the character
of S100A3 in solution. In DLS analysis, R51Z and R51Q were not precipitated
at concentrations of 0.5 mM and both showed a ∼1.5-fold increase
in molecular diameter in the presence of 2.0 mM Ca2+ and
0.5 mM Zn2+, whereas WT was aggregated under conditions
with similar (but lower) metal ion concentrations. In SEC analysis,
WT showed a small absorbance peak at 280 nm corresponding to the oligomeric
form in the presence of Ca2+/Zn2+ (Figure 1C), indicating that
it also undergoes partial nonspecific aggregation even at a concentration
of 100 μM. In a previous study, it was assumed that efficient
tetramerization of S100A3 requires both citrullination of R51 and
the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+.25 It has also been reported that S100A3 shows a citrullination-associated
increase in binding affinity for Ca2+ and Zn2+, which is also associated with structural changes involving these
metal ions.23

In terms of Ca2+-/Zn2+-dependent oligomerization, we found that
the molecular size of R51Q observed by DLS and SEC-SAXS was ∼1.5-fold
larger in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+ than
in a metal-free solution. Thus, the same changes in molecular size
were observed in different experiments under similar conditions. It
seems that citrullinated S100A3 is regularly oligomerized in the presence
of 4–5 molar equivalents of Ca2+ and 1 molar equivalent
of Zn2+. In addition, the present data indicate that citrullination
of S100A3 plays an important role in stabilizing the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound state. Under the same Ca2+ and
Zn2+ conditions, the molecular sizes of R51Z and R51Q were
increased and the Ca2+-/Zn2+-binding states
were more stable relative to WT.

Implication for the Tetramerization
Mechanism and Biological
Function of S100A3
In this work, we showed that R51Q is the
best mimic of R51Z (the citrullinated S100A3 at R51). The mechanism
by which modification of R51 induces tetramerization of S100A3 was
not elucidated; however, our work and the previous various reports
gave us insight into the mechanism of the unique structural change.

From the X-ray structure of S100A3 that we determined previously
(PDB code: 3NSO), R51 forms a salt bridge with D54 of helix III and hydrogen-bonding
interaction with the main chain carbonyl O of C93 at the C-terminal
tail (Figure 8A and
Supporting information Figure S2A).28 The role of R51 seems to stabilize the compact
structure. This stabilized state cannot bind low concentrations of
Ca2+ and hardly induces reorientation of helix III. Two
R51 residues of this S100A3 dimer are placed at the surface of the
molecule. The dimer–dimer interface would be caused repulsion
by positively charged if the two dimers of S100A3 formed a homotetramer.
Therefore, two dimers would not efficiently form a homotetramer, which
easily dissociates to go back to the dimers (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). When R51 is citrullinated,
the salt bridge with D54 should be lost (Figure 8B). This structural modification will release
the C-terminal tail or helix III from the position of R51. The Ca2+-binding induces helix III reorientation. These two hypotheses
are consistent with the results in this work. R51Z had higher affinity
for Ca2+ than WT (Figure 2). Additionally, R51Z showed induction of the tetramerization,
whereas WT retained the dimer when Ca2+ is bound to the
proteins (Figure 1B).
The Zn2+-binding disrupts the secondary structure; the
α-helix content is reduced (Figure 3). This further enhances the structural change
and increases the Ca2+-binding affinity cooperatively (Figure 4). In fact, without
secondary structural change, the complete Ca2+-bound model
of S100A3 could not be constructed from the WT S100A3 and Ca2+-bound S100A4 structures (Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information) (PDB codes: 3NSO and 3C1V).31 The Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound R51Z, in which the α-helix
content was reduced and the helix III was reoriented, could form the
homotetramer efficiently (Figure 4C,D,B).

Figure 8 One of the roles of R51 is to stabilize the structure
of S100A3.
(A) R51 forms a salt bridge with D54 and also forms a hydrogen-bonding
interaction with C90. This was found in PDB 3NSO. (B) When R51 is
substituted, the interactions are disrupted. This is observed from
a putative model constructed based on 3NSO. This structural relaxation probably
causes the increase in metal binding and enhances the structural change
(and further tetramerization).

From our results, R51Q showed similar properties to R51Z. When
R51 was substituted with glutamine, the length of the side chain is
shortened (Figure S2B in the Supporting
Information). The putative model that was constructed from the WT
S100A3 structure (PDB code: 3NSO) showed that R51Q should impair the interaction with
D54 or the C-terminal tail (Figure S2B in
the Supporting Information). This small structural change would make
the molecule to be relaxed. This might be why R51Q increases the Ca2+-binding affinity (Figure 2) and induces tetramerization efficiently (Figure 1B). In the presence
of Zn2+, the increase in the Ca2+-binding affinity
and the efficiency of homotetramerization are further enhanced (Figures 4E,F and 5C). These phenomena were very similar to those found
in R51Z. Further experiments including near-UV CD, dynamic quenching
fluorescence, fluorescence spectra using 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate
of all of the mutants, WT, and R51Z under a variety of conditions
are required to elucidate their detailed structures.

The citrullinated
S100A3 is a major component of the hair cuticle. The biological role of citrullination
of R51 in S100A3 is not clearly determined; however, the content of
citrullinated S100A3 was reported to be related to the rigidity of
endocuticle of aged hair.26 Unfortunately,
whether R51Q behaves in a similar way to R51Z in terms of biological
function was not elucidated in this work. In future works, the biological
behavior of R51Q should be validated to make this study definitive.
For instance, if recombinant R51Q is expressed in hair cuticular cells
to create “R51Q mutant hair cuticle”, it can be compared
with natural hair cuticle. Furthermore, if transgenic mice that express
R51Q can be created in the future, we can further discuss whether
R51Q is suitable as a model of citrullinated S100A3.

Experimental
Section
Protein Expression and Purification
The cDNA of human
S100A3 was inserted between the NdeI and XhoI sites of a pET-41a (+) (Novegen) transfer vector. The E. coli SHuffle T7 strain (New England Biolabs) transformed
with the resulting plasmid was grown in LB medium at 30 °C. At
OD600 = 0.8–1.0, the expression of S100A3 was induced
by adding 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside,
followed by culture at 27 °C overnight. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 13 000g for 30 min, washed
with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated in 0.1 M Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1.0 mM DTT, 1.0 mM ethylenediamineteraacetic
acid (EDTA), and 1.0 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysate
was centrifugated at 48 000g for 45 min. The
supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q FF column (GE Healthcare),
which was pre-equilibrated and washed with buffer A [20 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6), 1.0 mM DTT, and 1.0 mM EDTA]. S100A3 was eluted with
a NaCl linear gradient (0–0.45 M). The eluted fractions were
applied to Tricine SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing S100A3 were
collected.32 (NH4)2SO4 was added to the pooled fractions to a final concentration
of 1.5 M. After centrifugation at 12 000g for
30 min, the resultant supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Butyl HP
column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 1.5
M (NH4)2SO4. To remove contaminants,
the column was washed with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (1.5–0.3 M). Bound S100A3 was eluted
with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (0.3–0 M). The eluted fractions were applied to Tricine SDS-PAGE,
and fractions containing S100A3 were again collected. After dialysis
against buffer A, the sample was applied to a Mono Q 5/50 GL column
(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated, and washed with buffer A. S100A3
was eluted with NaCl gradient (0–0.18 M), and fractions containing
S100A3 were pooled and concentrated to approximately 3.0 mL by centrifugal
filtration. Lastly, the sample was passed through a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex
75 prep-grade column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM DTT, and 10 μM
EDTA.

Production of Mutated S100A3
Site-directed mutagenesis
of Arg51 of human S100A3 was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using plasmid pET-41a(+)-S100A3 as a template and QuikChange II (Agilent)
according to the instruction manual. The following mutagenic primer
sets were used with the modified bases underlined: for R51A, 5′-ACCTGGACCCCGACTGAGTTTGCGGAATGTGACT-3′ and 5′-AGTCACATTCCGCAAACTCAGTCGGGGTCCAGGT-3′; for R51C, 5′-CTGGACCCCGACTGAGTTTTGCGAATGTGACTACAACAAAT-3′ and 5′-ATTTGTTGTAGTCACATTCGCAAAACTCAGTCGGGGTCCAG-3′; for R51E, 5′-TAGTCACATTCCTCAAACTCAGTCGGGGTCCAGGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACCTGGACCCCGACTGAGTTTAAGGAATGTGACTA-3′; for R51K, 5′-TAGTCACATTCCTTAAACTCAGTCGGGGTCCAGGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACCTGGACCCCGACTGAGTTTAAGGAATGTGACTA-3′; for R51L, 5′-GACCCCGACTGAGTTTCTGGAATGTGAC-TACAACA-3′ and 5′-TGTTGTAGTCACATTCCAGAAACTCAGTCGGGGTC-3′; for R51Q, 5′-GACCCCGACTGAGTTTCAGGAATGTGACTACAAC-A-3′ and 5′-TGTTGTAGTCACATTCCTGAAACTCAGTCGGGGTC-3′. Transformation, expression,
and purification were carried out as described for WT S100A3.

Post-Translational
Modification of S100A3 by the PAD3 Enzyme
in Vitro
Recombinant PAD3 enzyme was prepared in E. coli, and its specific activity (where the amount
that citrullinated 1 μmol benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl
ester per hour at 55 °C was defined as 1 unit) was determined
as previously reported.33 Conventionally,
1.0 μg of recombinant S100A3 was reacted with 25 milliunits
of PAD3 enzyme in 20 μL of 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH
7.5) containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 5.0 mM DTT at 37 °C.
Modified S100A3 was isolated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
using Superdex 75 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM DTT, and 1.0 mM EDTA.
Modification of S100A3 was confirmed by 2-dimensional PAGE. The 2-dimensional
PAGE gel is shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting
Information.

Tryptophan Fluorescence Titration
Ca2+-dependent
structural changes in S100A3 were observed by Trp fluorescence. Ca2+ titration into recombinant WT, R51Z, and mutated S100A3
proteins (2 μM each) was carried out in 50 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1.0 mM DTT, as previously
described.30,34 The emission fluorescence intensity
at 340 nm (excitation, 295 nm) was recorded at 60 s after each cumulative
addition of CaCl2 using an F-4500 fluorospectrometer (Hitachi)
and a quartz cell (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm, Jasco). In addition, to confirm
the effect of Zn2+ on Ca2+-dependent structural change in
S100A3, Ca2+ titration was carried out in the absence or
presence of Zn2+.

CD Spectrometry
Zn2+-dependent
secondary
structural changes of recombinant WT, R51Z, and mutated S100A3s (15μM)
were monitored by far-UV CD spectrometry.4,25 The
CD spectra of S100A3 were recorded in 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.2 mM DTT using a J-720 spectropolarimeter
(Jasco, Japan) equipped with a rectangular quartz cell (1 mm path
length). The spectrum data were collected four times at a bandwidth
of 2 nm, a scan speed of 100 nm/min, and a response time of 4 s and
combined. In addition, to observe the effect of Ca2+ on Zn2+-dependent secondary structural changes of S100A3, Zn2+-titration was carried out in the absence or presence of
1 mM CaCl2. Considering that the crystal structures of
apo-dimers of WT (PDB code: 3NSI)28 comprise four helices
per monomer but not a β-sheet, the overall α-helix content
was calculated with the following equation: α-helix content
(%) = ([θ]222 + 2340)/-30 300.35

SEC and Dynamic Light Scattering
The native apparent
molecular mass of WT and mutated S100A3 (0.1 mM) in solution was estimated
by SEC using Superdex 75 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1.0 mM DTT at a flow rate
of 0.5 mL/min. Measurements of the Ca2+-dependent molecular
weight change were performed in the presence of 5.0 mM CaCl2 or 5.0 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 mM Zn(CH3COO)2. In addition, Ca2+-dependent molecular diameter
changes in WT, the citrullinated protein, and the mutated proteins
(0.5 mM) were observed by DLS with the addition of Ca2+ and Zn2+ in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing
150 mM NaCl and 1.0 mM DTT using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Panalytical)
and a ZEN0118 cell (Malvern Panalytical). Both types of experiments
were conducted at room temperature.

SEC-SAXS and Data Analysis
SEC-SAXS measurements were
performed at BL-10C of the Photon factory (Tsukuba, Japan) with an
X-ray wavelength of λ = 1.5 Å.36 An Acquity UPLC H-Class system (Waters) was operated with Superdex
75 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) to isolate oligomers and dimers
of S100A3. The solution used for metal-free S100A3 (WT and R51Q) was
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. In the
case of the R51Q mutant, an equivalent of Zn2+ and 2.5
mM Ca2+ (final concentration) were added to the metal-free
solution to obtain a more stable oligomeric state.36 Before each SEC-SAXS measurement, the column was equilibrated
with the appropriate buffer for each condition. The initial concentrations
of both the metal-free and Ca2+/Zn2+-complex
were adjusted to 5.8 mg/mL (0.5 mM), and 170 μL of the sample
was injected onto the column. For the SAXS measurement, the sample
eluted from the column flowed at 0.05 mL/min through a stainless steel
cell with an H1.5 × W3.0 × T1.0 mm aperture covered by a
0.02 mm-thick quartz glass window. At the same time as the SAXS measurement,
UV–visible light absorption was monitored to evaluate the sample
concentration at the X-ray-exposed position.37,38

The X-ray exposure times and number of images for each frame
were set to 20 s and 429 images, respectively. Scattering intensities
[I(Q)] were measured in the region
of 0.0121 Å–1 < Q <
0.6088 Å–1, where Q = 4π sin θ/λ,
with a distance of 1.01 m between the sample and the detector. Images
were collected on a PILATUS3 2M detector (Dectris). Hundreds of two-dimensional
images were azimuthally averaged and converted to one-dimensional
profiles by using SAngler.39 All scattering
profiles divided by transmission were subtracted from the background
intensities collected in 15 images before sample injection. Intensities
were converted to an absolute scale by using water scattering as a
standard. Hundreds of subtracted scattering profiles were processed
by Serial Analyzer software,40 which corrects
the baseline of the chromatogram on each Q point and ultimately calculates
the extrapolated scattering profile at infinite dilution. SAXS data
figures were drawn by using Igor Pro ver. 6.34 (Wave Metrics Inc.).
The values of the scattering intensity at zero angle [I(Q)] and the radius of gyration (Rg) from Guinier analysis (Q × Rg < 1.3) were estimated by using AUTORG.41 To compare the solution structure with the dimer
in the crystal structure, theoretical scattering profiles
of X-ray crystal structures (PDB ID: 3NSI) were calculated by using CRYSOL.28,42

Conclusions
In this work, we produced recombinant S100A3
in the E. coli SHuffle T7 strain and
obtained S100A3 that
was post-translationally citrullinated by PAD3. In addition, mutants
in which R51 was replaced with various amino acids were obtained by
the same procedure used for WT. Among the various mutants, R51Q was
obtained in the highest yield. In addition, a comparison of biophysical
and biochemical properties indicated that the R51Q mutant showed the
most similarity to R51Z. From these results, we conclude that R51Q
is the optimal mutant model of S100A3 that has been post-translationally
modified by PAD3. This is consistent with a previous study in which
arginine residues were converted to glutamine as a model of MBP citrullinated
by PAD. Furthermore, citrullination of S100A3 may be essential for
stabilization of the Ca2+-/Zn2+-binding state.
The results of this study will lead to the further development of
structural analyses for the Ca2+-/Zn2+-bound
S100A3.
