We
design a coupled plasmonic nanostructure, which consists of
a Ag rhombus nanoparticle positioned over a silver film, separated
by a dielectric spacer layer, and perform numerical analysis by calculating
the radiation loss resistance of this nanostructure as the perfect
electric conductor metal based on the theory of
transmission line modes. Compared with the nanocube or triangular
nanodisk film-coupled plasmonic nanostructures introduced in the previous
works, a stronger electric field enhancement was achieved in the Ag
rhombus nanoparticle film-coupled nanostructure because of the fact
that the sharp tip of the rhombus nanoparticle can generate field
enhancement at a hot spot. In order to demonstrate that the sharp
tip can confine the electromagnetic energies strongly, we also have
calculated the Purcell factor and the far-field directivity of the
quantum emitter in the vicinity of this nanostructure.

1 Introduction
Plasmonic nanostructure
can be taken as an optical nanoantenna;
it can efficiently convert far-field radiation into a localized field
and vice versa, which is because noble-metal nanostructures have a
good response for plasmons.1 On the surface
of noble-metal nanostructures (such as Au and Ag nanoparticles), electron-gas
has collective oscillation properties known as the localized surface
plasmon resonances. Based on this theory, many significant applications
have been developed in recent years, such as optical interaction between
dye molecules or quantum emitters (QEs), surface-enhanced Raman scattering,2 plasmon-enhanced fluorescence and luminescence,3−5 strong QE-plasmon coupling,6,7 and plasmonic laser.8−10

Since Purcell’s work has shown that the decay rate
of an
excited atomic state is not only a function of the atom but also of
its electromagnetic environment,11 a variety
of plasmonic nanocavities or nanoantennas have been designed to promote
the radiation of QEs or molecules, such as gold nanosphere,3,5,12 noble-metals nanoshell dimes,13−16 metallic nanohole arrays,17 or other
nanostructures.18 Recently, advancements
have shown that film-coupled nanoparticle systems (a metallic nanoparticle
positioned over a metal film offers great advantages as a highly controllable
system relevant for enhancing the electric field and modifying the
decay rates of nearby QE) such as the film-coupled plasmonic nanostructures
of triangular nanodisks19 and nanocubes20−22 also known as the metal–insulator–metal structures
are applied in promoting the Purcell factor of the QE. The advantage
of this film-coupled structure is that the coupling strength can be
readily tuned by controlling the thickness of the dielectric spacer.
Some authors have studied the electric field enhancement of the film-coupled
nanostructure by means of the transmission line mode and a plasmonic
circuit theory;23,24 however, the plasmonic circuit
theory would become invalid when the nanoparticles have strong enough
edge effects.25 These edge effects stem
from the fact that the sharp angles of a rhombus nanoparticle funnel
most of the resonant energy into the tip19,26−28 resulting in a larger field enhancement at the hot
spot in the nanostructure. In contrast to the traditional film-coupled
nanostructure including a nanocube or triangular nanodisk, in this
article, we will put forward a film-coupled plasmonic nanostructure
containing an Ag rhombus nanoparticle positioned over a silver film,
separated by the SiO2 spacer layer (see Figure 1), so as to obtain a stronger
electric field enhancement; as for the Ag rhombus nanoparticle film-coupled
nanostructure, its electric field enhancement being used to promote
the radiation of the QEs have not been researched up to now, which
will be clarified below.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram of the Ag rhombus nanoparticle
film-coupled
plasmonic nanostructure, α is the sharp angle of the Ag rhombus
nanoparticle, the side length of the rhombus is A = 100 nm, the height W = 80 nm, the thickness of
the SiO2 spacer layer h = 10 nm, and the
Ag film is 100 nm in (b).

The fundamental resonance of the film-coupled planar nanoparticle
arises from the transmission line mode localized between the nanoparticle
and film,29,30 where the plasmonic resonance mode is similar
to that of the microstrip antenna. To demonstrate this advantage of
our design, we assume that the silver film and the Ag rhombus nanoparticle
are PEC metals (for a plasmonic nanostructure, the skin depth of subwavelength
electromagnetic waves in a metal cannot be ignored) and apply the
transmission line mode to calculate the radiation loss resistance
of the nanorhombus film-coupled structure, then analyze the electric
field enhancement of this nanostructure by means of the three-dimensional
finite-difference-time-domain methods (FDTD solutions v8.19, Lumerical).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Electric Field Enhancement
The extinction
efficiency of the Ag rhombus nanoparticle film-coupled structures
are shown in Figure 2a the maximal values of the sharp peaks are at 957, 985, and 1051
nm when the sharp angle of the Ag rhombus nanoparticle is set as α
= 60°, 45°,30° respectively; this peaks are the surface
plasmon resonance of this nanostructure. The simulation results of
electric field enhancement at the hot spot are presented in Figure 2b–d. The incident
light, with the polarization direction being parallel to the long
axis of the Ag rhombus, illuminates vertically on the nanostructure. Figure 2b shows that, as
the sharp angle α = 60°, the maximum value of the electric
field enhancement occurs at the resonance wavelength of λ =
957 nm; Figure 2c shows
that, as α = 45°, the maximum field enhancement occurs
at the resonance wavelength of λ = 985 nm; Figure 2d shows that, as α =
30°, the maximum field enhancement occurs at the resonance wavelength
of λ = 1051 nm.

= 60°. (c) Electric field enhancement as the sharp angle α
= 45°. (d) Electric field enhancement as the sharp angle α

In particular, Figure 2d shows that the
maximum field enhancement attains |Eloc|/|E0| >
250 at the hot spot, which is larger than
the result of 211 via a single triangular nanodisk.19

2.2 Purcell Factor and far
Field Directivity
To calculate the Purcell factor of QE in
the nanostructure shown
in Figure 3a, we present
a simulated analysis shown by Figure 3b,c. In Figure 3a, there are three film-coupled nanostructures excited by
the incident light at wavelength 957, 985, and 1051 nm, respectively.
As shown in Figure 3b, the smaller the sharp angle is, larger is the Purcell factor at
the hot spot, which results in red-shifting of the resonance wavelength.
Moreover, putting the QE into the dielectric spacer of the nanostructure
with the sharp angle of α = 30° and adjusting the distance
of l (see Figure 3a), Figure 3c shows that as l becomes larger, the QE
is closer to the sharp tip of the rhombus, such that the Purcell factor
becomes large.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic diagram of the film-coupled nanostructure,
the red
arrow inside the SiO2 film represents the QE whose orientation
is vertical to the surface of the Ag substrate, l denotes the distance between the QE and the center of the film.
Panel (b) shows curve graphs of the QE’s Purcell factor vs
wavelength, for a fixed l = 80 nm. The red solid
line corresponds to the case of α = 30°, the green dotted
line corresponds to the case of α = 45°, and the blue dotted
line corresponds to the case of α = 60°. (c) Curve graphs
of the QE’s Purcell factor vs wavelength, for the same sharp
angle α = 30°. The red solid line corresponds to the case
of l = 70 nm, the green dotted line corresponds to
the case of l = 80 nm, and the blue dotted line corresponds
to the case of l = 90 nm. (d) Directivity cross section
diagram of the XZ far field of the QE in the nanostructure,
where l = 80 nm, λ = 1051 nm, the red solid
line denotes the far field directivity and radiation intensity for
α = 30°, the blue dotted line corresponds to the case of
α = 45°, and the black dotted line corresponds to the case
of α = 60°.

In addition to the promising Purcell factor enhancement, Figure 3d shows that the
coupling of the QE to the nanostructure can also enhance the directivity
of the far field radiation. For a single QE with the z-orientation, the intensity of the far field radiation can be significantly
enhanced when the sharp angle α = 30° (see Figure 3d).

In order to compare
the results of the Ag rhombus nanostructure
with previous experiments, field enhancement and Purcell factor of
other nanoparticle film-coupled nanostructures are generalized (see Table 1). As seen from these
data of field enhancement and Purcell factor, the Ag
rhombus nanostructure has a strong field enhancement and the Purcell
factor is not bad compared with the other film-coupled nanostructures.
When the gap size, g < 10 nm, there is strong
coupling between the nanostructure and the QE;7 the gap size (spacer dielectric thickness) is too thin to fabricate
it conveniently, although the Purcell factor of the QE is pretty high.

3 Conclusions
We have made an improvement for
the nanocube or triangular nanodisk
film-coupled structure by using the nanorhombus, so as to obtain a
stronger electric field enhancement and a larger QE Purcell factor
at the hot spot. Applying the theory of transmission line mode, we
calculate the radiation loss resistance of the triangular nanodisk
and show that the radiated loss resistance of the triangular structure
is bigger than that of the nanocube, which is due to the fact that
the sharp angle can confine the electric field at the hot spot more
strongly, and then enhance the QE’s Purcell factor more effectively.
Moreover, we calculate the far field directivity and the radiation
intensity of the QE and arrive at a conclusion that, as the sharp
angle becomes smaller, the radiation intensity becomes stronger.

4 Computational Methods
4.1 Radiation Loss Resistance
In our
Ag rhombus nanoparticle film-coupled structure, the Ag rhombus should
be regarded as consisting of two equilateral triangular nanodisks
because of symmetry; our rhombus model can be simplified in terms
of an equilateral triangle microstrip antenna shown in Figure 4, thereby what we need to calculate
is just the radiation loss resistance of a single PEC triangular microstrip
film-coupled antenna.

Figure 4 Schematic diagram of the equilateral PEC triangle microstrip
antenna.
In (a), the arrows in the dielectric gap indicate the strengths and
directions of the electric fields, the antenna is working at the TM010z resonant mode. In (b), the
fictitious magnetic currents flow along the slot, meanwhile the directions
of the electric fields are denoted by dots and crosses.

As shown in Figure 4, the incident light induces a resonant mode, whose
electric field
is vertical to the metal patch. In terms of the radiation loss mode
caused by the loss magnetic modes Hν,29 the radiation loss power
of the film-coupled antenna can be written as Pμνrad = ∫(Eμ* × H̃ν)·n dS/2Uμ, where Eμ is the lossless electric mode, Uμ is the normalization constant for the
electric and magnetic energy in the dielectric spacer. The fictitious
magnetic currents, Ms(30) at the slots that are opening along the periphery
of the patch are shown in Figure 4b, which is 1  where the unit vector, n is vertical
to the surface of the slots shown in Figure 4, and Ea is the electric field at the surface
of the slots.

For convenience, we will just consider the case
that the antenna
is working at the TM010z resonant
mode. According to eq 1, in Figure 4b, the
fictitious magnetic currents parallel to the x-axis
have vanished along the nonradiating slot, whereas the slots adhering
to the hypotenuses of the triangle microstrip antenna are the radiating
slots. In the spherical coordinate frame {r,θ,ϕ}, one
can show the horizontal component of the electric field Eϕ = 0, and then the electric and magnetic fields
of a single radiating slot at the far field point, r are, respectively30 2  where, in terms of the y-component
of the fictitious magnetic current, one has 3  where , Z = ihk cos θ, k is the incident
wavenumber, A is the side length of the triangular, h is the thickness of the spacer layer (see Figure 4a), and E0 is
the incident light normalized value.

Now, using eq 2 the
superposition of the electric fields of the two radiating slots as
follows 4  where f(θ,ϕ)
is a dimensionless function of the angular coordinates, and hk ≪ 1, such that Z = ihk cos θ → 0, and then 5  where Le represents
the effective distance between two radiating slots. Using eqs 4 and 5, the total radiated power can be written as 6  

Let V0 = hE0, , it
follows from eq 6 that 7  where Rloss represents
the radiation loss resistance of the PEC patch antenna, and 8   9  

Now, using eq 8, we
will calculate the radiation loss resistance of the triangular nanodisk
given by Figure 4a,
with the result shown via Figure 5a furthermore, the far field scattering cross section
of the triangular nanodisk and the nanocube are simulated by the FDTD
solutions shown in Figure 5b (note: these nanostructures as the plasmonic nanoantenna
are no longer the PEC patch antenna). For comparing our results with
the previous results provided by reference,23 the side length and thickness of our triangular nanodisk are taken
as the same as the ones of the nanocube in ref (23).

Figure 5 (a) Curve graphs of the
radiation loss resistance vs wavelength.
(b) Far field scattering cross section of the nanostructures vs wavelength.
One of our triangular nanodisk is denoted by the red dotted line,
whereas that of the nanocube is denoted by the blue solid line. Both
the nanodisk and nanocube have the side length A =
100 nm, and the spacer dielectric thickness, h =
10 nm.

The total power can be written
as Ptotal = Pcav + Prad, where Pcav denotes that the power is
confined to the nanostructure enhancing the electric field, whereas
the radiated power, Prad, is launched
by the radiating slots. For a given total power, the larger Pcav is, the smaller Prad is, and vice versa. On the other hand, eq 7 implies that the larger Rloss is, the smaller Prad is.
As a result, Figure 5 shows that, compared with the nanocube, the radiating slots in the
triangular microstrip antenna have a smaller radiated power, thereby
most of the EM energy is confined to the rhombus nanoparticle film-coupled
nanostructure.

4.2 Purcell Factor of QE
Estimating the
capability of QE’s radiation by calculating the Purcell factor
is the universal way, the QE emission decay rate, γ, has been
given by Fermi’s golden rule.31 To
calculate the QE’s emission decay rate in the dielectric space
conveniently, Lukas Novotny has given the expression for the decay
rate32 10  |p| is the transition
dipole moment, and ρm is a plasmon mode density in
the dielectric space.

The electric field enhancement implies
that a plasmon mode density is also promoted at the hot spot (see eq 12 later), and then the
QE’s Purcell factor would be boosted.32 In fact, let us assume that the plasmonic nanostructure is working
at the plasmonic mode with the oscillation frequency of ωm, when the QE decay rate, γcavr is enhanced relative to the free-space
decay rate, γ0r, and the Purcell factor is expressed as 11  where Qm is the
mode quality factor, and Vm is the mode
volume in the dielectric spacer. For the moment, the plasmon mode
density, as the position function of r in the dielectric spacer, can be defined as the inverse of Vm(28) 12  where Em(r)
is the electric field, V is the geometric volume
of dielectric spacer, and ε′
is the real part of the metal Ag dielectric constant.
