A single-crystalline
Bi2S3 nanowire array
(Bi2S3NWA) is synthesized by an in situ hydrothermal
reaction on the surface of a Bi2MoO6 film. As
no additional source of Bi3+ is provided during the process,
the Bi2MoO6 layer acts as the Bi3+ source for the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanowires.
The fabricated Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA electrode exhibited an increased photoelectrochemical (PEC) sulfite
oxidation activity, which is attributed mainly to the effective interface
obtained by the in situ hydrothermal growth, compared to other Bi2S3 electrodes. The generated electron from the
Bi2S3 conduction band rapidly transfers to that
of Bi2MoO6, yielding an enhanced electron separation
of Bi2S3. Furthermore, the single-crystalline
Bi2S3 nanowire can provide a fast electron pathway
to Bi2MoO6 through its single domain, which
also contributes to the improved PEC activity.

Introduction
Utilization of sunlight
has been considered a promising solution
to overcome the exhaustion of fossil fuels.1 The development of semiconductor photoelectrodes has attracted considerable
attention for the efficient conversion of solar energy.2−6 The examination of the semiconductors in photoelectrochemical (PEC)
cells is a fast and simple method to characterize their electrochemical
behaviors.3 Although many semiconductors
have been examined as photoelectrodes,7−18 most of them have modest PEC efficiencies owing to the narrow visible
light absorptions and unavoidable electron–hole recombinations.
To decrease the bulk recombination, nanostructures, such as nanoparticles
and nanorods, have been studied as photoelectrodes,19 which can enhance the kinetic parameters of the PEC reactions
because of the reduced hole diffusion length. The shape, size, and
connection of the nanostructures can affect the charge transport properties
and thus, play a critical role in the efficiency of PEC cells. However,
these nanostructures exhibit several disadvantages, such as a reduced
space charge region and high surface recombination.6 Therefore, further studies are required to optimize the
sizes and shapes of nanostructures for improved PEC performances.

Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) has attracted large
interest as a sensitizer for photovoltaic and PEC cells owing to its
narrow band gap of approximately 1.3 eV and large absorption coefficient.19−25 However, the reported photocurrent is considerably lower than its
theoretical maximum (∼30 mA/cm2). The recombination
at the surface and in the bulk state of Bi2S3, leads to a lower PEC conversion efficiency. One-dimensional Bi2S3 structures such as nanorods and nanowires have
been studied as photoelectrodes, which can provide the advantages
of a reduced hole diffusion length and enhanced charge transport properties.26−30 On the other hand, the Bi2S3 nanowires must
be grown on a conductive substrate to enable efficient interactions
for improved PEC properties. As most Bi2S3 nanowires
are prepared as powdered samples, their deposition on substrates is
another challenging process.31 To decrease
the interface resistance between the Bi2S3 nanowire
and the conductive substrate, an in situ synthetic method is required.
Thus, a simple synthesis on the substrate is required to reduce the
fabrication complexity of the PEC devices.

In this paper, we
report a facile synthesis of a Bi2S3 nanowire
array (Bi2S3NWA) on
a Bi2MoO6 layer by an in situ hydrothermal method.
The Bi2S3NWA was uniformly fabricated and well
connected on the Bi2MoO6 layer. Structural characterizations
were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman
spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Compared to other Bi2S3 electrodes, the fabricated Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite exhibited an increased
PEC sulfite oxidation activity, which is attributed mainly to the
effective interface obtained by the in situ growth. This unique composite
also has dual electrochemical functions, as a light absorber (Bi2S3NWA) and an electron acceptor (Bi2MoO6 layer). The generated electron from the Bi2S3 conduction band rapidly transfers to that of Bi2MoO6, yielding an enhanced charge separation of
Bi2S3. In addition, the single-crystalline Bi2S3 nanowire can provide a fast electron pathway
through its single domain, which also contributes to the increased
PEC activity.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA Composite Electrode
Bi2S3NWA was synthesized in situ on the surface
of a Bi2MoO6 film (Scheme 1). The Bi2MoO6 film
was fabricated by
a drop-casting method of a precursor solution onto a fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) substrate and subsequent annealing at 500 °C
for 3 h in air (Figure 1a). Bi2S3NWA was then directly grown on the
Bi2MoO6 film by a hydrothermal reaction (Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA). Figure 1b shows a scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of Bi2S3NWA
fabricated on Bi2MoO6. The nanowires have an
average width of 87 ± 14 nm and a length of 1.2 ± 0.2 μm
(Figure S1).

Figure 1c,d shows
XRD patterns of the Bi2MoO6 and Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite films, respectively.
The diffraction peaks of Bi2MoO6 are indexed
to the orthorhombic structure (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction
Standards (JCPDS) no. 21-0102), indicating its high crystallinity
(Figure 1c). Figure 1d shows the XRD pattern
of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA
composite. New peaks are detected in addition to the Bi2MoO6 peaks, which correspond to the Bi2S3 phase (orthorhombic, JCPDS no. 17-0320). Additional phases
such as Bi2O3 and MoO3 were not discovered
in the XRD patterns (Figure 1d).

TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses were
carried out to
identify the structural composition of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite (Figures 2 and S2). The
HRTEM images of an edge of a single Bi2S3 nanowire
show the lattice spacings of 0.25 and 0.20 nm corresponding to the
(420) and (002) planes (Figure S2a,b).30,32 The fast Fourier transform patterns indicate the single-crystalline
Bi2S3 nanowire, reflecting the fast crystalline
growth toward the [001] direction (Figure S2b). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry of the nanowires showed an
average atomic ratio of 39:60 (Bi/S), indicative of the 2:3 atomic
composition. A spatial elemental mapping was performed on a Bi2S3 nanowire to evaluate the distribution of each
element (Figure 2c–f).
The nanowire was composed of Bi and S in the ratio of 2:3 (Figure 2d,e), while the substrate
was composed of Bi and Mo in the ratio of 2:1 (Figure S2). The elemental mapping confirmed that the Bi2S3 nanowires were directly grown on the Bi2MoO6 layer (Figure S2).

Figure 3 shows Raman
spectra of the Bi2MoO6 and Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite films in the range
of 50–900 cm–1. The Raman peaks of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite at
98, 188, 236, and 255 cm–1 are in agreement with
those of the orthorhombic Bi2S3 (red line in Figure 3).33 Bi2MoO6 peaks are not observed in
the spectrum of Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA, indicating that the Bi2S3 layer
is uniformly grown on the surface of the Bi2MoO6 layer.34,35 The surface states of both Bi2MoO6 and Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA films are further characterized by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 4).36 The two high peaks at 164.1
and 158.8 eV are assigned to Bi 4f (Figure 4a,b). The S 2s peak at 224.8 eV (S2– in the metal sulfide) is detected only for the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite film, but not for
the Bi2MoO6 film (Figure 4c,d). Therefore, the XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman
spectroscopy, and XPS results verify the presence of Bi2S3NWA on the Bi2MoO6 surface.

Sulfide anions (S2–) were produced by the decomposition
of thiourea during the hydrothermal reaction.24 Small amounts of Bi3+ and Mo6+ ions were also
generated by the dissolution of Bi2MoO6 during
the reaction. The solubility of Bi2S3 in an
aqueous solution is considerably lower than that of molybdenum sulfide,
which have Ksp values of 1.0 × 10–97 and 2.2 × 10–56,37−39 respectively. The Bi3+ ions reacted more rapidly than
the Mo6+ ions with S2– ions forming the
Bi2S3. As no additional source of Bi3+ was provided during the process, the Bi2MoO6 layer acted as the Bi3+ source for the growth of Bi2S3 nanowires. As the Bi2S3 has an extremely low solubility (Ksp of 1.0 × 10–97), the hydrothermal sulfidation
of the Bi2MoO6 may spontaneously follow the
etching and regrowth mechanisms proposed by Chen et al.38 The Bi2S3 nanowires grow
rapidly along the direction vertical to the substrate in a large amount
of S2–.38,40

To obtain a reliable
growth, the reaction solution with the Bi2MoO6 substrate was heated at a relatively low temperature
(60 °C for 4 h) in the presence of a large amount of S2– (0.2 M of Na2S). The surface of Bi2MoO6 was initially white, but after the reaction for 4 h, it turned
to black brown, indicating the formation of Bi2S3 (Figure S3). The Bi2S3 layer grew larger and then reorganized forming amorphous
Bi2S3 particles, but not nanowires. However,
several Bi2S3 nanowires were grown on the surface
of the Bi2MoO6 electrode at 100 °C for
4 h. Therefore, both large amounts of S2– and a
high reaction temperature (above 100 °C) were needed to follow
the etching and regrowth mechanisms for the growth of Bi2S3 nanowires on the Bi2MoO6 surface.
The unreacted Mo6+ ions were analyzed by inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The Mo6+ ions remained
in the solution throughout the reaction without the formation of a
molybdenum sulfide film.

PEC Characterization of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NW Composite Electrode
Various Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3 heterostructures
were prepared by well-known synthesis methods to compare the PEC performances
of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA
electrodes (Scheme 2). The structures are denoted as Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop) and Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Dip). Furthermore, pure Bi2S3 nanowires (Bi2S3NW) were fabricated
by the hydrothermal method for comparison.30Figure S4 shows SEM images of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Dip), Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop), and Bi2S3NW electrodes. The Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA and Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop) samples were adjusted with Bi2S3 layers of the same thickness using their UV–visible
absorption spectra (Figure S5).

A sacrificial
reagent, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), was used to
examine the PEC performance. Sulfite anions (SO32–) are an efficient hydroxyl radical (•OH) scavenger
and react in most diffusion-controlled
rates.41 Therefore, the SO32– oxidation is a suitable model reaction for the measurement
of the degree of bulk recombination of the semiconductor. It is considered
to provide a surface transfer efficiency of almost 100% during the
PEC measurement owing to the fast kinetics at the semiconductor–solution
interface.42

The PEC performances
of the electrodes were investigated using
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for sulfite oxidation (0.1 M Na2S + 0.1 M Na2SO3). The LSV was carried
out in the range of −0.9 to −0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl at
a scan rate of 20 mV/s with a chopped UV–visible irradiation
(Figures 5 and S6). All electrodes successfully generated anodic
photocurrents, which confirmed their n-type characteristics. The photocurrent
of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA
electrode was 7.6 mA/cm2 at −0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl),
while that of Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop), fabricated by drop-casting the Bi2S3 nanowires onto the Bi2MoO6 electrode, was
0.8 mA/cm2 at the same potential (black bars in Figure 5b). The fabricated
Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA electrode
exhibited highly increased PEC activity compared to the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop), which is attributed
to the effective composite interface obtained by the in situ growth.
The photocurrent of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Dip) and Bi2S3NW were 2.2, and
0.7 mA/cm2, respectively, at the same condition (black
bars in Figure 5b),
which indicates the importance of single-crystalline Bi2S3 nanowires on the Bi2MoO6 substrate.
The photocurrent of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA electrode was also several times higher than those
of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop),
Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Dip), and
Bi2S3NW electrodes under the visible light irradiation
(red bars in Figure 5b).

Figure 5 (a) LSVs of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite under a UV–visible illumination (back

M Na2S recorded at a scan rate of 20 mV/s and a light intensity
of 100 mW/cm2. (b) Photocurrent densities of the electrodes

and (d) current–time response curve of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite at an applied potential
of −0.50 V vs Ag/AgCl.

Figure 5c presents
the action spectrum of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA electrode, which shows the photocurrent depending
on the wavelength, acquired with an interval of 10 nm. The portion
of the visible light region (>425 nm) is about 85%, which matches
well with Figure 5a.
Furthermore, the band gap was determined using the wavelength of the
onset photocurrent. The action spectrum indicates a band gap of 1.35
eV. It is well matched with the absorption spectrum (Figure S5). The Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NW electrode exhibits an identical onset wavelength
as that of Bi2S3 (about 1.3 eV),25 which indicates that Bi2S3NWA is the main absorber for the PEC reaction. The band gaps of the
electrodes were also calculated by the Tauc equation.43 The direct band gaps of the heterostructures (Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop) and Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA) are almost identical
(Figure S5), and thus, the band gap difference
is not the main factor for the PEC activity in the case of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3 heterostructures.

To evaluate the stability of Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA, chronoamperometry was carried out under
a UV–visible illumination (Figure 5d). The current transient upon the light
irradiation was usually attributed to the dynamic balance of photogenerated
electrons and their consumption at the semiconductor–solution
interface.44,45 This is a characteristic indication
of surface recombination even in the sacrificial reagent.46 Although the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NW electrode exhibited initial decreases in the
photocurrent, the photocurrents stabilized at steady-state values
for 2 h in the presence of the sacrificial reagent (Figure 5d).

In order to understand
the mechanism of the increased PEC activity
of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA
electrode, the flat-band potentials of Bi2MoO6 and Bi2S3 were measured. The Mott–Schottky
(MS) plots were recorded using a Na2SO4 solution
(Figure 6a,b).30 The MS plot indicated that the flat-band potential
of Bi2S3 is approximately 0.15 V [vs normal
hydrogen electrode (NHE)] with an n-type behavior. The flat band potential
of Bi2MoO6, estimated using the MS plot was
approximately 0.25 V (vs NHE). The conduction band edge (ECB) is considered to be more negative than the flat band
potentials by approximately 0.1 V.23,30 Therefore, the typical ECB and valence
band edges (EVB) of Bi2S3 are approximately 0.05 and 1.40 eV, respectively, (vs NHE),
while those of Bi2MoO6 are approximately 0.15
and 2.95 eV (vs NHE), respectively, which are matched well with the
literatures.30Figure 6c shows possible photogenerated electron–hole
pathways based on the MS plots: (1) electron transfer from the ECB of Bi2S3 to that of
Bi2MoO6, (2) hole transfer from the EVB of Bi2MoO6 to that
of Bi2S3, and (3) electron–hole recombination
at the Bi2S3–Bi2MoO6 interface.

measurements in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at 500
Hz. (c) Photogenerated electron–hole pathways between the two
semiconductors (Bi2MoO6 and Bi2S3).

ECB and EVB of Bi2MoO6 are more positive than those of
Bi2S3, favorable for the charge separation of
Bi2S3. The origin of the increased PEC activity
of the heterostructure compared to that of the bare Bi2S3 electrode is attributed to the enhanced charge separation
of Bi2S3 on the Bi2MoO6 electrode (pathways 1 and 2 in Figure 6c) under the solar light irradiation. Furthermore,
the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA electrode
fabricated in situ has an effective interface with a lower resistance
(reduced pathway 3 in Figure 6c) than that of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Drop) electrode. In addition, the Bi2S3 nanowires can provide fast electrical pathways to Bi2MoO6 through their single domains, compared to
that of the Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3(Dip) electrode.

Conclusions
The Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA
electrode was prepared by the in situ growth reaction. The Bi2S3 nanowires were homogeneously grown on the Bi2MoO6 layer. As no additional source of Bi3+ was provided during the process, the Bi2MoO6 layer acted as the substrate and the Bi3+ source for
the synthesis of Bi2S3 nanowires. The spontaneous
growth of Bi2S3 nanowires from the Bi2MoO6 by the etching and regrowth mechanisms provided a
suitable interaction with the Bi2MoO6 substrate.
The fabricated Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA electrode exhibited an increased PEC activity compared to other
electrodes. The increase in activity was attributed mainly to three
factors: (1) increased electron separation of Bi2S3 on the Bi2MoO6 layer as ECB and EVB of Bi2MoO6 were more positive than those of Bi2S3, encouraging charge separation of Bi2S3, (2) a suitable interface obtained by the in situ synthetic method,
and (3) single-crystalline Bi2S3 nanowires which
provided a fast electron pathway through the nanowire.

Methods
Materials
An FTO- coated glass (TEC 15, WY-GMS) was
used as the substrate for the thin-film electrode. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as metal precursor salts. Thiourea
(≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (36.5%, Junsei), ethylene
glycol (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropyl alcohol (99.5%, Junsei),
sodium sulfite (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium sulfate (99.0%,
Daejung Chemicals), and sodium sulfide nonahydrate (96.0%, Junsei)
were used as received. Deionized water was used as the solvent in
all electrochemical experiments.

Fabrication of the Bi2MoO6 Film on FTO
FTO substrates were cleaned
in deionized water and ethanol, and
then sonicated in ethanol for at least 1 h. Drop-casting was carried
out to fabricate the thin-film electrodes. A solution of 15 mM Bi2MoO6 precursor (an atomic ratio of Bi/Mo of 2:1)
in ethylene glycol was prepared and then applied onto the FTO substrate
(15 mM, 200 μL). The prepared film was annealed at 500 °C
for 3 h (with a ramp time of 3 h) in air to form the Bi2MoO6 thin film.

Fabrication of Bi2S3NWA on Bi2MoO6/FTO
Bi2S3 nanowires
were directly grown on the surface of the Bi2MoO6 layer using an in situ hydrothermal reaction. The Bi2MoO6 layer on the FTO substrate was horizontally placed
into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. A reaction solution
was prepared by adding thiourea (7.9 mmol) into deionized water (30
mL). The reaction solution was transferred into an autoclave, and
then heated in an electric oven at 140 °C for 4 h. The resulting
Bi2MoO6/Bi2S3NWA composite
electrode was dried at 50 °C in air.

When the reaction
solution was maintained at 140 °C for 48 h, Bi2S3 nanowires were grown directly on the surface of the FTO substrate.
The nanowires fully covered the FTO substrate, and the majority were
slightly tilted on the substrate.
