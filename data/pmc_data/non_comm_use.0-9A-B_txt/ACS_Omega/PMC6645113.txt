The anomalous volume expansion of
poly-(N-isopropyl
acrylamide) (PNIPAM) solutions was observed during the thermally induced
polymer phase transition of aqueous solutions having concentrations
in the 3–7 wt % range. The process occurred on a millisecond
time scale, and a laser temperature-jump time-resolved technique was
used to bring about the process. After heating a solution with a pulse
laser exploiting light absorption by dyes added to the solution itself,
a phase transition was observed to take place, and the temporal changes
associated with it were visualized through the transient grating imaging
technique, whereby the solution was heated with a stripe pattern.
We found several processes occurring on a millisecond time scale,
all of which clearly took place after each PNIPAM molecule had collapsed
structurally from a coiled to a globular conformation. During the
so-called demixing process, the globular polymers aggregated with
each other within 10 ms, and suddenly the polymer phase expanded as
aggregation progressed further. After this process, the individual
globular polymers reverted to their coiled conformation via hydration
during the remixing process. We proposed that solution expansion
was caused by the mutual entangling of multiple globular PNIPAM molecules,
instead each globule polymer was separated.

Introduction
Thermoresponsive polymers
are regarded as promising materials for
applications such as drug delivery1,2 and the collection
of chemicals in solutions.3,4 Currently, one of the
best-known thermoresponsive polymers is poly-(N-isopropyl
acrylamide) (PNIPAM), which has attracted much interest because of
the fact that its phase transition occurs at near-ambient temperature.
PNIPAM has been utilized for various applications, such as the collection
of precious metals5 and waste chemicals.6 Notably, it has also been utilized as a separation
material in chromatographic procedures.7 Furthermore, much attention has been devoted to this polymer’s
phase-transition process because it is assumed to have similarities
with the protein folding.8,9

The detailed process
of phase transition, typical of this material,
is still controversial, even with respect to the temperature at which
it occurs10 because of the nonequilibrium
behavior of this chemical. It has been suggested that the phase-transition
and the following recovery processes of this material include some
unclear states that have a very long lifetime and are characterized
by the presence of “mesoglobules”.11 In differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and turbidity
measurements, which are techniques that have been typically used for
studying thermodynamic properties, the phase-transition and the recovery
processes display a hysteresis behavior. In particular, as the temperature
increases, the coiled molecules of PNIPAM go through a collapsed state12 and acquire a globular conformation that is
typical of a dehydrated state. Moreover, many indications exist that
PNIPAM may remain in a mesoglobular state even after the temperature
decreases.

The kinetics/dynamics of PNIPAM’s phase change
have been
studied with various methods, such as measuring turbidity13 and utilizing fluorescent probes,14 Brillouin spectroscopy,15 modulated temperature DSC,16 and small-angle
neutron/X-ray scattering.12,17 Before the demixing
process, where the globular polymers are separated with water, molecular
contractions occur in the nanosecond to microsecond time scale,14 followed by the demixing process, which occurs
in the millisecond scale.13 Van Mele et
al. indicated the vitrification of polymer-rich phase caused by the
retardation of remixing process,16 and
Müller-Buschbaum et al. identified a multistep process involving
the dehydration of the polymer and the occurrence of structural changes
that take place on a time scale on the order of tens of minutes.17 Philipp et al. found that two states with different
elastic constants are formed during the demixing process.15,18 During this process, they also observed an anomalous increase of
the volume expansion coefficient of the polymer solution at around
the temperature of the phase transition, involving a change in the
number of hydration water molecules attached to PNIPAM because of
release.19

We have studied the phase-transition
dynamics of PNIPAM solutions
by using the temperature-jump transient grating (TG) method.20,21 In this technique, a polymer sample solution containing heat-generating
dyes is subjected to instantaneous heating with a stripe pattern of
pulsed light, and the resulting change in the refractive index of
the solution is measured. We have determined that various processes
occur during the phase transition.21 In
particular, during the phase recovery from the globule state to the
coil state. We have identified the presence of some intermediate states
without any visible absorption characterized by the change in the
refractive index of the PNIPAM solution20 that would correspond to the mesoglobular state. However, the phase-transition
dynamics was very delicate for the experimental conditions of the
temperature and the heating pump light intensity, and the dynamic
processes were varied by a change of temperature on the order of 0.1°.21 Furthermore, polymer aggregation caused the
detection light to scatter, and this caused the TG response that was
caused not only by the refractive index change but also by the transmittance
change because of the turbidity change, which, in turn, increased
the difficulty of interpreting the data. Kita and Wiegand clarified
the Soret effect involving the PNIPAM molecules using an optical configuration
similar to that utilized in the TG technique. In this, a distribution
of different temperatures across a solution is obtained using a continuous
heating laser; subsequently, the molecular diffusion instigated by
the built-up temperature distribution is measured. PNIPAM molecules
have a positive Soret coefficient, indicating that these molecules
diffuse from high-temperature to low-temperature regions.22,23 Orlishausen and Köhler identified two opposite regions formed
in the laser-heated region: one is the expanded region of the solution
because of the positive Soret coefficient, promoting the stretching
of the molecules, and the other is the contraction region because
of the aggregation of molecules to the phase-separated region.24

Recently, we have developed a TG imaging
technique whereby changes
in the refractive index of a solution can be imaged directly. This
technique was applied to the study of the phase transition of liquid
crystals, and its use enabled us to clarify the details of the process,
particularly in the milliseconds to seconds time scale, when the phase-transition
response of a PNIPAM solution is easily influenced by atmospheric
conditions. Because in this approach images can be obtained
even in the presence of light scattering, we applied this method to
the study of remixing/demixing processes induced by phase transition
in a PNIPAM solution. Surprisingly, we observed a peculiar phase-change
behavior, which we termed “aggregation-induced expansion”.
This phase change occurred when the polymer density reached 
a threshold value.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a consists
of a graph in which are reported the TG responses versus time in logarithmic
scale measured for a 7 wt % PNIPAM aqueous solution. The dynamics
inferred from these data was consistent with our previous observations,21 although a degree of difference that is because
of different concentrations of the PNIPAM solution is evident. According
to the data from previous studies, the PNIPAM polymer solution’s
response up to 10–3 s includes molecular dehydration
(∼20 ps), contraction (∼200 ns), coil–globule
transition (∼100 μs), and thermal decay (∼1 ms).
Even after thermal decay is assumed to have already taken place, the
signal intensity increased and reached a peak at 20–40 ms,
followed by a decay. On the basis of the assignments made for the
observations in the milliseconds-to-seconds time scale in previous
studies,20,21 after the thermal decay, the aggregation/release
of globular molecules (demixing/remixing, 1–100 ms) took place;
subsequently, the globular molecules or the assembly of several globule
molecules (mesoglobules11) decayed into
a coil state on a time scale on the order of milliseconds to seconds,
depending on the temperature setting. Because the peak/decay course
in the graph reported in Figure 1a was similar to the response observed when the temperature
setting was about 1 °C lower than the phase-transition temperature
measured by DSC measurements (33.2 °C), it could be assumed that
the peak/decay pattern observed in the milliseconds to seconds time
scale was because of the aggregation of globular molecules (demixing),
the release of globular molecules from the aggregate (remixing), and
the decay of mesoglobules to form coiled polymers. These three processes
correspond to the rise in the TG response intensity (10–3 to 10–1.5 s), its decay up to the shoulder (10–1 to 10–0.5 s), and the subsequent
decay (10–0.8 to 100.8 s), respectively.
This assignment is supported by the fact that the observed peak showed
a shoulder around 160 ms, which implies that the decay response was
the result of two processes.

Figure 1 (a) TG response and (b) corresponding TG image
sequences from 2
ms to 10 s for a 7 wt % PNIPAM solution. The TG image sequences were
divided into four time regions, and the original video is included
in Movie S1 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1b reports
the sequence of the corresponding TG images recorded from 2 ms to
10 s. We could identify four main processes in the image sequence.
Until 6 ms (images in I), the stripe pattern of the refractive index
change increased its contrast, meaning that the change in the refractive
index increased. Past this time point, the stripe interval of the
refractive index change suddenly increased, and the stripe itself
became obscured until 300 ms (images in II). Subsequently, the stripe
pattern reappeared with a stripe pattern with a larger stripe interval
than the original pump pattern around 500 ms (images in III). Finally,
the stripe pattern decreased its contrast gradually about 3 s (images
in IV).

Because the process taking place in the millisecond
time scale
occurred after the coil-to-globule transition (the collapse of PNIPAM
molecules) had already happened, the said process must consist of
the aggregation of the globular molecules and the concomitant release
of water molecules from the aggregates (demixing). In the process
subtended by the images in I (process I), it is assumed that the refractive
index change increased as the aggregation of the globular molecules
proceeded and as water molecules were progressively released from
the resulting globule aggregates. Because of the changes in their
densities, both the water-rich and polymer-rich phases underwent additional
changes in their refractive indexes, and the contrast of the TG images
became stronger. Notably, the dark and bright areas of the images
became even darker and brighter, respectively.

The fact that
the stripe pattern disappeared during process II
and reappeared during process III is surprising because in both processes,
the observed phase pattern was induced by density changes brought
about by PNIPAM globule aggregation. However, at the time scale in
process II, we observed an increase in light scattering, which is
assumed to result from the formation of aggregates of increased size,
which, in turn, gave rise to Mie scattering. Furthermore, a flow was
observed to be induced within the sample, which the video, included
in the Supporting Information, can
clearly confirm. On the basis of the evidence from previous studies,
this flow is assumed to be a consequence of the release of water during
phase separation, and the process of expelling water was discussed
in relation with the elastic property of the PNIPAM polymer.15,18 Therefore, during process II, it is believed that light scattering
was boosted by an increase in size of PNIPAM globule aggregates, which
caused the stripe pattern to become obscured.

After the flow
had stopped, the stripe pattern reappeared in process
III. Finally, a gradual decay of the globular PNIPAM structures to
reform the coil structure and to recover the original solvation of
the polymer molecules (remixing) took place, which caused a loss in
the refractive index in contrast with respect to the initial conditions. Scheme 1 depicts the proposed
dynamic scheme.

Scheme 1 Proposed Scheme for the Demixing/Remixing Process
of a PNIPAM Solution
That Takes into Account the TG Image Sequence Reported in Figure 1b
It is mentioned that the phenomena observed
in the present study
are different from the thermophoretic diffusion, namely the Soret
effect, whereby a stationary temperature gradient causes the mass
diffusion of molecules. In the experiments described above, the sample
solution was heated by a pulse laser, and the temperature profile
(thermal grating) decayed within a millisecond (a decay in 10–4 to 10–3 s in Figure 1a). Therefore, no temperature gradient existed
in the sample after the decay of thermal grating.

In our previous
reports,20,21 we had come to the
conclusion that light scattering was induced by the aggregation of
the globular PNIPAM molecules, which resulted in the polymer globule
aggregates randomly distributing in the solution and acting as light
scatterers. However, this conclusion was clearly mistaken because
the stripe pattern was maintained even during processes II and III,
when the globule aggregates had already formed.

Notably, the
polymers suddenly started to expand after several
milliseconds (processes I and II). During processes I–III,
the globular-structure molecules should form aggregates; however,
the relevant TG images are characterized by an expansion of the stripe
interval, after the density increases because of the aggregation of
globular molecules. Although the thermal expansion coefficient of
PNIPAM has been reported to increase drastically around the phase-transition
temperature,15,18,27 this is the first study in which the expansion was recorded in real
time, and it was found that the expansion proceeded discontinuously
for several milliseconds after the phase transition, namely after
the aggregation of globular molecules proceeded for several milliseconds.

Philipp et al. investigated the anomalous enhancement of the thermal
expansion coefficients around the temperature of phase transition.18,19 They reported that the thermal expansion coefficient is dependent
on the PNIPAM concentration. We, on the other hand, studied the dependence
of the demixing/remixing dynamics of a PNIPAM solution on the concentration
of the polymer solution. Figure 2 reports the TG responses versus time (10–3 to 101 s) of PNIPAM solutions at different concentrations.
The intensity of the TG signal peak observed in correspondence with
the 10–3 to 10–2 s time range
depended on the PNIPAM concentration. Initially, this intensity gradually
increased alongside the polymer concentration, with a maximum value
observed for a solution with a 7 wt % concentration. However, at higher
concentrations, the peak intensity started to decrease progressively.
Because the TG signal intensity qualitatively depends on the size
and number of PNIPAM globule aggregates, given that the refractive
index change is proportional to the medium’s density, the data
reported in Figure 2 indicate that the aggregation proceeded effectively, peaking at
a PNIPAM concentration of ∼7 wt %.

Figure 2 TG responses vs time
(1 ms to 10 s) of PNIPAM aqueous solutions
of different concentrations (1–15 wt %).

To investigate the demixing/remixing processes of a PNIPAM
solution,
TG image sequences were measured for PNIPAM solutions in the 3–15
wt % concentration range (relevant videos can be found in the Supporting Information). The expansion of the
stripe was observed for solutions in the 5–10 wt % concentration
range, whereas no expansion was observed for the 3 and 15 wt % solutions.
These results are consistent with the observations on the thermal
expansion coefficient.15 All of the same
experiments were performed using SY as a dye, and the general trend
was the same as that observed in experiments involving new coccine
(NC) as the dye (Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting Information). No dependence of the results showed that the
observation did not depend on guest dyes but on PNIPAM.

On the
basis of the TG images, we calculated the maximum expansion
ratio for different polymer concentrations (Figure 3). At the bottom of Figure 3 is reported the ratio between the TG image
of 5 ms and those for the maximum expansion for each concentration.
The volume expansion ratio drastically increased in the 3–5
wt % polymer concentration range; however, it decreased gradually
in the 5–10 wt % concentration range. Philipp et al.19 and Winnik et al.27,28 reported that
the expansion is caused by the release of hydration water molecules.
The TG image sequences indicated that the polymer region (the dark-colored
region) increased in width (size) to become larger than the water
region (the light-colored region) around 1 s after pump irradiation.

Figure 3 Top: Comparison
of TG images before (5 ms) and after (700 ms) the
expansion process for solutions characterized by different PNIPAM
concentrations. Bottom: Expansion ratio data vs PNIPAM concentrations
obtained from the TG images.

The maximum peak intensity of the TG responses reported in Figure 2 was observed at
almost the same polymer concentration as the expansion peak. Because
the TG signal intensity is dependent on the density of the aggregated
molecules, the analogies between the concentration dependence of the
parameters reported in the y-axes of the graphs in Figures 2 and 3 indicate that the aggregation was relevant to the expansion process.
During the aggregation process, hydration water molecules were released
from the aggregates, so that the globular polymers lost water molecules,
whereas the water region acquired them.

Because the formation
of the globular molecules via dehydration
on the molecular level occurs on a time scale on the order of hundreds
of nanoseconds21 and the following contraction
(collapse of PNIPAM) takes place on a time scale on the order of hundreds
of microseconds,13,14 the two processes just alluded
to have already been completed before the millisecond region is reached.
Therefore, at this stage, each polymer molecule is in the globular
state, and the process taking place should be the diffusion-driven
demixing between the globular molecules and the water molecules. Because
only the change in the refractive index contrast, corresponding to
the density change, was observed for <10 ms, we suppose that the
globular polymer molecules aggregated with each other, whereas water
molecules were expelled from the polymer region. If this process had
continued exclusively, there would be no reason for the observed expansion;
therefore a qualitatively different process must also have taken place.
One possible explanation for the mentioned expansion would be the
entanglement between globular molecules. Because a PNIPAM molecule
has many hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups along its polymeric
chain, each globular molecule could untangle and merge with another
via globule–globule interaction.

To examine this possibility,
the ratio of the number of PNIPAM-based
globules to that of water molecules and the ratio of PNIPAM molecules
to that of water molecules were calculated. These values were 1:25 000
and 1:120, respectively, for 5 wt % solution of PNIPAM (MW: 25 000),
for which the largest expansion was observed. Because each monomer
is hydrated with ∼10 water molecules in the coiled state, a
number reduced to ∼2 in each of the globular monomer,19 8 water molecules are released per PNIPAM monomer
during the phase transition, indicating that almost 10% of the solution’s
water content was expelled during the demixing process. Furthermore,
each globular polymer comprised ∼200 monomer units, meaning
that ∼400 water molecules were still part of the polymer assembly
to keep each globular molecules isolated. Because the number of the
hydration water molecules is on the same order as the number of monomer
units in each globule, it is possible that a globular PNIPAM molecule
favors merging with another one by the interaction of the hydrophobic
and hydrophilic groups in different globular PNIPAM molecules instead
that each one remain isolated because of hydration by water. We assume
that the globule aggregates expanded in size because of this tangling
of globular molecules. To verify this assumption, we need to know
the change in the enthalpy and entropy resulting from replacing hydration
water molecules with a globular PNIPAM molecule, and further investigations
of the thermodynamic properties of this process are necessary. Currently,
such investigations are underway.

Conclusions
Using
a newly developed TG imaging technique, we were able to observe
the expansion of a PNIPAM solution during the demixing process occurring
at the time of polymer phase transition. The expansion was observed
during the aggregation of globular molecules taking place within a
specific polymer concentration range. After the PNIPAM molecules underwent
the transition between the coiled and the globular conformation, the
globular polymers aggregated with each other as part of the so-called
demixing process, and we propose that there are two aggregation processes
that took place. During the initial process, the density of the globule
aggregates increased, whereas the volume of these aggregates expanded
during the second aggregation process. This observation can be made
only by imaging the refractive index change because no obvious color
change is involved in the phase transition and the following aggregation
processes, and the TG imaging technique would be a powerful tool for
observing phase-transition dynamics. The results from the present
study may pave the way for investigation of the nonequilibrium phase-transition
thermodynamics of polymer solutions.

Experimental Section
Materials
PNIPAM was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (molecular
weight: 19 000–30 000 g/mol). Deionized water was used
for the preparation of aqueous PNIPAM solutions in the 1–15
wt % concentration range. NC was one of the photothermal dyes25 dissolved in the PNIPAM solutions. To confirm
that the presence of NC had no effect on the dynamics of PNIPAM, another
photothermal dye, sunset yellow (SY), was used to study the dye dependence
of PNIPAM dynamics (Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting Information). The concentration of NC was 1.0 mM
in each PNIPAM solution. The sample solution was placed in a handmade,
500 μm thick quartz cell, and the absorbance of samples was
set about 1.0 for the pump light wavelength. The quartz cell was covered
with an aluminum frame, whose temperature was controlled by a heater
controller (TC200, Thorlabs). The initial temperature of the samples
was set to 1 °C below the demixing temperature, which was determined
by DSC. Figure S4 in the Supporting Information shows the DSC data for PNIPAM solutions at different concentrations.
The temperature jump because of the pump pulse irradiation was about
2.0 °C, which was confirmed by the observation of the temperature
at which the turbidity was increased because of the coil–globule
transition (T′) with an aid of the pump pulse
irradiation. T′ could be confirmed by monitoring
the turbidity as the heater temperature was gradually increased. Because
we had determined the phase-transition temperature (T) through DSC measurements, the temperature rise because of the pump
pulse could be estimated from the difference between T and T′.

Measurements
A
detailed principle on the laser temperature-jump
method is provided elsewhere.20 Although
in previous studies we utilized the heterodyne TG method,21 in which the refractive index change was measured
via the heterodyne signal, the homodyne TG method was used here;26 Figure S5a in the Supporting Information reports a schematic representation of the setup.
In detail, an excitation pulse was made to pass through a transmission
grating and, thus, the grating pattern produced was projected onto
the sample using a 4f configuration of two lenses with different focal
lengths, and the fringe space on a sample was reduced to half of the
original one. The pump pulse was absorbed by the photothermal dye
molecules present in the sample solution, and the pump energy was
converted to heat, causing the temperature to rise locally in a pattern
determined by the grating pattern mentioned above. Refractive index
changes were induced within the sample according to the same fringe
pattern, which is referred to as TG. Normally, the first-order light
diffraction is detected in these kinds of experiments. However, because
of the volume expansion of a PNIPAM solution in the observations,
the grating spacing was changed during the measurements, causing the
diffraction angles varied during the measurements; therefore, we detected
the zeroth-order diffraction light, which is characterized by a diffraction
angle that never changes during the expansion process. For imaging
purposes (see Figure S5b in the Supporting Information), an additional 4f optical setup was constructed, and a CMOS camera
(MV1-D1024E-160, Photon Focus) was placed on the image plane. After
rejecting the pump pulse with a notch filter, the interferometric
technique was used to retrieve the phase image of the sample. The
image sequence was recorded continuously after the pump pulse irradiation
had been initiated. Typically, 100 images were recorded for each trigger,
and the interval between frames was 1–10 ms. Moreover, each
image was processed by the subtraction of the original image without
the pump irradiation from it, and only the photoinduced refractive
index change was extracted.

Because the TG phase image is induced
by the differences between the refractive indexes of the various locations
within the sample, the intensity of each pixel of the image is proportional
to the change in refractive index of a particular spot. The refractive
index change for a polymer solution is given by the following equation 1  where the first term, called
the temperature
grating, corresponds to the refractive index change because of the
temperature change, and the second term, the density grating, corresponds
to the change in density of the sample. Because thermal grating decays
a few milliseconds after the pump irradiation, past this time, the
change in density of the solution induces the refractive index.

The pump light was a Nd:YAG pulsed laser (pulse width: 5 ns, wavelength:
532 nm, and irradiation intensity: 36.8 mJ/cm2 pulse) (GAIA,
Rayture Systems). The probe light was a He–Ne laser (wavelength:
633 nm) (Thorlabs). The interval of the pump pulse, which was typically
20 s, was long enough for the baseline of the TG signal intensity
to go back to the original value between pulses. The transmission
grating spacing was 60 μm in each experiment.
