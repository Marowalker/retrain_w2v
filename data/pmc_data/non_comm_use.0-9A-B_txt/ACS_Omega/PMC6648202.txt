Development
of novel and greener methods for the selective oxidation
of various organic compounds is a challenging task. Herein, a novel
protocol for the selective oxidation of aromatic amines to nitroaromatics
at room temperature is developed. The oxidation reaction was carried
out using a mixture of formic acid and aqueous hydrogen peroxide,
which resulted in the in situ formation of performic acid. Further,
improvement of selectivity was studied using different surfactants,
of which cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) gave the highest selectivity
(85%) toward nitrobenzene. The role of CTAB in achieving higher selectivity
is discussed. Under optimized reaction conditions, various substituted
amines were successfully oxidized to corresponding nitro compounds.
It is worth mentioning that this is the first report on oxidation
of amines to nitro compounds in an aqueous medium with high selectivity.

==== Body
Introduction
The
selective oxidation of amines to the desired product is a challenging
task.1 It leads to the formation of hydroxylamine,
nitroso, nitro, oxime, azoxy, azo compounds, etc., and most of them
are very reactive, which lead to the formation of self-condensed products.
However, all of them are very attractive synthons and could be used
in the synthesis of a variety of products in pharmaceutical, perfumery,
explosive, and dye industries.2 There are
numerous pathways reported for the synthesis of nitro compounds via
the electrophilic substitution reaction using a hazardous nitrating
mixture, diazotization of amines, and oxidation of aniline (Scheme 1).2 However, these reported methods require harsh reaction
conditions and handling of spent acid is the primary environmental
concern. Apart from this, many nitro-substituted compounds are difficult
to synthesize via the aforementioned methods.3 Many research groups have focused on the development of novel ecofriendly
methods using different catalysts and oxidants. The first report on
the oxidation of aromatic amines to nitroaromatics was studied in
depth by Emmons et al. using anhydrous peracetic acid as an oxidant
to achieve selective nitroaromatics.4 However,
the use of anhydrous conditions is industrially not feasible. Hence,
the development of an alternate method is desired. For this purpose,
many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts were reported. However,
there are only a few reports available on the use of a homogeneous
catalyst for oxidation of amines. For instance, Doyle et al. reported
the use of the dirhodium caprolactamate/T-HYDRO homogeneous catalyst
for oxidation of substituted aniline to nitro compounds.5 In another report, Defoin et al. reported the
use of molybdenum complex for selective oxidation of aniline to nitrosobenzene
at room temperature with 53–80% yield.6

Scheme 1 Various Routes for the Synthesis of Nitroaromatic Compounds
Furthermore, several heterogeneous
catalysts like MnO2, Pb(OAc)4, Hg(OAc)2, W, Zr, Re, Ti, Au, Cu,
Ag, Co, etc. were also used to achieve mediocre to good selectivity.7−17 Also, Ti/Cr silicates,18 various heteropolyacids,19 and Nb2O520 have also been reported to achieve maximum selectivity.
Ranga Rao et al. used methyl imidazolium phosphotungstate as a catalyst
for selective oxidation of aniline to nitrobenzene using m-MCPBA as an oxidant.21 These catalysts
have a drawback in terms of either poor selectivity or the cost of
the catalysts used. The use of a greener and safer oxidant like H2O2 or oxygen is an advantage. Thus, from the environmental
point of view, many research groups have been interested in using
greener oxidants and solvents or solvent-free conditions. Additionally,
there are a very few literature reports available for selective formation
of nitro compounds from arylamines, wherein the selectivity toward
nitroarenes is controlled by a surfactant/ionic liquid, by varying
the concentration of oxidant or pH.22 The
use of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with tungstophosphoric
acid and aqueous sodium perborate as an oxidizing agent for the selective
formation (45–91%) of nitroarenes was achieved with a longer
(12 h) reaction time.23 Herein, we have
used formic acid, which is cheaply available and an ideal solvent
as well as could in situ generate performic acid when mixed with 50%
aq H2O2 as and when required to oxidize arylamines
to corresponding nitroarenes at room temperature.

Catalytic Reaction
Oxidation of aniline was carried
out in a 15 mL reaction tube. The mixture of aniline (0.250 gm) and
CTAB (20 mg) was stirred, followed by simultaneous addition of formic
acid (1 mL) and 50% hydrogen peroxide (0.8 mL) slowly to the reaction
mixture and stirring for 15 min. The progress of the reaction was
monitored by gas chromatography (GC) and thin layer chromatography.
The reaction was quenched by addition of aq NaHCO3 solution
followed by extraction with ethylacetate. The organic extract was
dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuum
to get crude nitrobenzene compounds. Further, crude nitrobenzene was
purified by a column chromatography method using silica gel (100–200
mesh) as the stationary phase and eluted by hexane/ethylacetate (95:5)
as an eluent. Yields were calculated based on isolated products. Products
were characterized by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) and NMR spectroscopy (Supporting Information (SI), S1). The GC–MS spectra of the products
are shown in SI, Figures S1–S8.

Results and Discussion
Oxidation of aniline leads to the formation of various products
like hydroxylamine, nitroso, nitro, oxime, azoxy, and azo compounds
as shown in Scheme 2. As stated earlier, the selective oxidation of arylamines is a difficult
task. Herein, we have developed a novel method for selective formation
of nitro compounds.

Scheme 2 Oxidation of Aniline and Its Possible Product Formation
Initially, oxidation of aniline
was tested in the presence of only
hydrogen peroxide, which gave no reaction (Table 1, entry 1). This indicates that hydrogen
peroxide is not efficient to oxidize aniline to any product. Further,
the reaction conducted using formic acid and aniline led to the formation
of an amide. The reaction was tested in the presence of acetonitrile
and toluene as solvents. An excellent conversion of amine was observed
in both the solvents, but the selectivity toward nitrobenzene was
poor; the major products formed were azo and azoxybenzene (Table 1, entries 3 and 4).
Further, the peracids are known to be good oxidizers for various organic
compounds. Thus, we used this knowledge and utilized formic acid and
hydrogen peroxide to generate performic acid, which is expected to
oxidize the aromatic amines. Therefore, we carried out the reaction
without solvent and obtained excellent aniline (97%) conversion with
poor (42%) selectivity to nitrobenzene (Table 1, entry 5).

The use of surfactants
in organic reactions is well documented
in the literature for many purposes; mostly dispersion of organic
compounds in water by the hydrophobic core of micelles can solubilize
hydrophobic reactants. Strukul et al. reported the asymmetric Baeyer–Villiger
oxidation with Co(Salen) and H2O2 in water,
and the yield and selectivity of the desired product both increased
compared to those without the surfactant.24 The polar or nonpolar nature of an organocatalyst dictates its affinity
for the micellar environment or the aqueous phase, and this influences
the outcome of the reaction.25 Novák
and co-workers have proposed the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, and
the reaction rate was increased by using an anionic surfactant, sodium
dodecyl sulfate, for the dissolution of the substrate.26 The amphiphilic nature of the surfactants controls
the selectivity of the product by altering the reaction rate and chemoselectivity.23 Thus, we also used various surfactants like
trimethyl(tetra-decyl ammonium bromide), CTAB, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone),
and potassium bromide as additives in this reaction. It was observed
that the cationic surfactants increase the formation of nitrobenzene.
Among these, CTAB showed better selectivity toward nitrobenzene. The
selectivity for nitrobenzene increased from 42% (Table 1, entry 6) to 81% (Table 2, entry 6). As stated
earlier, CTAB might stabilize the nitroso intermediate and avoid the
further addition to aniline to form the azoxy compounds and thus results
in the selective formation of nitrobenzene.

The effect of the concentration
of hydrogen peroxide was studied
by varying the molar ratio of aniline to H2O2. With the increase in the concentration of H2O2, the conversion of aniline and selectivity to nitrobenzene both
increased. This shows that the formation of performic acid is directly
dependent on H2O2 concentration (Table 3).

The longer reaction time for
the oxidation of aniline to corresponding
nitrobenzenes is well reported in the literature.27 However, in our case, the reaction time was much less,
precisely 15 min (Table 4, entry 2). No substantial change in the selectivity was observed
with a further increase in the reaction time (Table 4, entry 3). Also, our results were compared
with those reported in the literature, and comparative data is given
in SI, Table S1.

To demonstrate the versatility of
our developed protocol, we have
further extended our protocol for oxidation of differently substituted
amines to nitro compounds. When p-toluidine was used
as the substrate, a complete conversion of p-toluidine
was observed with 90% selectivity and 75% yield of p-nitrotoluene in 15 min. Similarly, the electron-donating alkyl substituents
gave better selectivity toward corresponding nitro products (Table 5, entries 2–5).
However, the aniline with electron-withdrawing substituents gave moderate
selectivity (Table 5, entry 6). In the case of halogen substituents, the selectivity
decreased due to the self-aromatic nucleophilic substitution (Table 5, entries 8 and 9).
This did not happen in the case of fluorine due to the poor leaving
nature of fluorine (Table 5, entry 7). In the case of benzylamine and benzylhydroxylamine,
no conversion was observed, which indicates that the aromatic ring
is activating the oxidation reaction.

The proposed mechanism for oxidation
of aniline to nitrobenzene
is depicted in Scheme 3. The addition of H2O2 to formic acid results
in the in situ formation of performic acid. Also, it is well reported
that quaternary ammonium salts enhance the solubility of the organic
substrates as well as oxidizing agents in the liquid phase and at
the same time catalytic activity in free radical reactions.28 It is a well-established fact that the oxygen
atoms of peracids are not in the same electronic environment; the
oxygen atom of the carbonyl group is nucleophilic and the other one
is electrophilic. It is expected that the positively charged CTAB
will interact with the negatively charged oxygen atom of peracids
to favor the formation of radicals. The formed radicals interact with
aniline to give the N-phenylhydroxylamine radical
and subsequently N-hydroxy-N-phenylhydroxylamine.
Then, formic acid transfers the proton to N-hydroxy-N-phenylhydroxylamine to give the corresponding nitroso
product, which again interacts with performic acid and abstracts the
electron-deficient oxygen, forming a final nitro product.

Scheme 3 Proposed
Mechanism for Oxidation of Aniline
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a method
for oxidation of various
aromatic amines to selectively produce nitro compounds (39–92%)
using aqueous hydrogen peroxide under mild reaction conditions by
following a metal-free, ecofriendly, and economically viable protocol.
The high selectivity of nitro compounds using a greener oxidant like
aq H2O2 is reported within a short period of
15 min. The optimized protocol was also applied for selective oxidation
of various substituted aromatic amines, where the electron-donating
substituents gave good selectivity above 92%, while the electron-withdrawing
substituents gave moderate (48%) selectivity. This protocol would
be beneficial for many organic transformations.
