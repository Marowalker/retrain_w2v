A new
cyclic pentasaccharide comprising an oxymethylene glycosidic
bond connecting the individual α-d-glycopyranoside
monomers is synthesized through cycloglycosylation of a linear pentasaccharide
precursor, which, in turn, is synthesized through the block glycosylation
method. Molecular modeling shows that the 30-membered macrocyclic
pentasaccharide is a distorted ellipsoid structure, with the lower
and upper rims occupied by secondary and primary hydroxyl groups,
respectively. Following the synthesis, the microenvironment of the
cyclic pentasaccharide is assessed through thermodynamic evaluation
upon complexation with 1-aminoadamantane in an aqueous solution, which
shows the formation of ∼1:2 host-to-guest complex and a binding
affinity of 10 500 (±425) M–1. Synthesis
and assessment of the host–guest binding property of the new
glycosidic bond expanded cyclic pentasaccharide are presented.

Introduction
Naturally
occurring cyclic oligomers of sugars represent a family
of macrocycles that offer immense opportunities in both fundamental
studies and applications.1−3 Cyclic oligosaccharides, namely,
cyclodextrins (CDs) and cycloinulo-oligosaccharides, are excellent
examples on which a number of studies and applications have emerged,
resulting from decades of developments.4−6 Cyclic oligosaccharide
macrocycles provide exquisitely varied chemical microenvironments
that endow them properties to interact with differing cognate molecular
entities with high selectivity and specificity.7,8 The
bowl-shaped molecular structure presents a distinct molecular microenvironment
with differing hydro- and lyophilicities, and differences in these
properties formed the basis to exploit these macrocycles as hosts
to complex with differing classes guest molecules. Further, the ability
to fine-tune the properties becomes feasible through modifications
of the pendent hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-3, and C-6 carbons of the
individual sugar monomers constituting the cyclic oligosaccharides,
with substituents that either enhance or reduce the extent of hydro-
and lyophilic balance. Modifications of linkers connecting the monomers
of cyclic sugar oligomers are also known. Incorporation of aromatic,9 diyne,10 triazole,10,11 phosphate,12 urea, thio-urea,13 and disulfide moeities14 was demonstrated earlier as linkers connecting each monosaccharide
in the cyclic oligomers. Replacing glycosidic oxygen with sulfur,
selenium, carbon, nitrogen, and aminoxy functionalities were demonstrated,
so as to mimic the glycosidic bond.15−17 In addition, a β-1,4-glycoside
bond in place of the α-anomer constituted as a modification
of the cyclic oligomer.18 On the other
hand, the formation of inclusion complexes with varying types of guest
molecules represents a major advancement in host–guest chemistry
associated with cyclic oligosaccharides.19−25 As a result of fine complexation behavior, logical applications
of host–guest complexes have emerged in the areas of diagnostic
and therapeutic importance.26−28 We undertook an effort to construct
cyclic oligosaccharides constituted with intersugar glycosidic bond
having an additional methylene moiety. Disaccharides possessing an
oxymethylene-extended glycosidic bond show an increased hydrolytic
stability, as compared to disaccharides with a native glycosidic bond.29 The glycosidic-bond-expanded di- and trisaccharides
were taken forward further and subjected to a cycloglycosylation reaction,
which resulted in the formation of the corresponding cyclic di-, tri-,
and tetrasaccharides.30,31 Incorporation of the additional
methylene in between the glycosidic oxygen and C-4 methine carbon
led to the macrocycles with a larger ring size when compared to native
cyclodextrins constituted with similar number of monosaccharide residues.
This increase in the molecular cavity sizes, with the corresponding
increase in the amphiphilic character, led to an enhancement in the
binding affinities with the chosen host molecules, in comparison to
native cyclodextrins. Encouraged by the results, we undertook to synthesize
glycosidic bond expanded cyclic oligosaccharides with a larger ring
size. We herein report the synthesis of a cyclic pentasaccharide from
a linear pentasaccharide monomer, incorporated with the additional
methylene moiety at each glycosidic bond. The resulting cyclic pentasaccharide
adopts a distorted elliptic shape of the structure, as deduced from
the molecular modeling studies. Further, the ability of the cyclic
pentasaccharide as a host is assessed through binding with 1-aminoadamantane
as a guest, with the aid of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),
from which the binding stoichiometry and the binding affinity are
identified. Synthesis, structural, and the complexation abilities
of the glycosidic-bond-expanded cyclic pentasaccharide are presented
herein.

Results and Discussion
The initiation monomer, namely,
4-hydroxymethyl-4-deoxy-d-glucopyranoside 1,
was synthesized through exocyclic
one-carbon homologation of suitably modified glucopyranoside as reported
earlier.29 Monomer 1 was derivatized
with orthogonal protecting groups, which enabled the utilization of
suitably protected derivatives of 1 as glycosyl donor
and acceptor, leading to the formation of glycosidic-bond-expanded
disaccharide 2.30 Target cyclic
pentasaccharide synthesis was planned through the synthesis of the
linear pentasaccharide 5. The synthesis was initiated
by the conversion of disaccharide derivative 2 to the
corresponding thioglycoside derivative 3 through (i)
removal of anomeric p-methoxybenzyl alcohol-protecting
group, using trifluoroacetic acid; (ii) O-acetylation
by treatment with Ac2O and pyridine; and (iii) reaction
with p-thiocresol in the presence of BF3·OEt2 (Scheme 1). The formation of thioglycoside glycosyl donor 3 (α/β = 1:1.14) was ascertained by the appearance of
a peak at 5.71 ppm as a doublet (J = 5.2 Hz) for
anomeric proton (Hα-1) in the 1H NMR spectrum.
The corresponding Hβ-1 anomeric proton merged with
set of other protons. In the 13C NMR spectrum of 3, the appearance of peaks at 88.0 and 88.4 ppm was attributed
to anomeric Cα-1 and Cβ-1, respectively.
Formation of 3 was further confirmed by electrospray
ionization (ESI)-mass spectroscopy, where it showed a molecular ion
peak at 1081.4536 [M + Na]+ as the base peak.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Glycosidic-Bond-Expanded Linear Pentasaccharide
Reagents and conditions: (i)
CF3COOH, CH2Cl2/H2O, 0
°C to room temperature (rt), 11 h; (ii) Ac2O, pyridine,
4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), 0 °C to rt, 5 h; (iii) p-thiocresol, BF3·OEt2, CH2Cl2, rt, 4 h, 73% (after three steps); (iv) N-iodosuccinimide (NIS), TfOH, PhMe, molecular sieve (MS)
(4 Å), 0 °C, 2 h; (v) NaOMe, MeOH, rt, 4 h, 58% (after steps
iv and v).

The trisaccharide derivative 4 was synthesized through
the glycosylation of thioglycoside donor 3 with monosaccharide
glycosyl acceptor 1, followed by deprotection, to afford
acceptor hydroxyl functionality, as described previously.31 The activated thioglycoside 3 was
subjected to glycosylation with the glycosyl acceptor 4 in the presence of NIS/TfOH in PhMe at 0 °C. The reaction led
to the formation of O-acetyl-protected derivative,
which was subjected to O-deacetylation to afford
the linear pentasaccharide 5 in 58% yield (Scheme 1). In the 13C NMR
spectrum of 5, appearance of a resonance at 97.1 ppm
for the anomeric carbon indicated the α-anomeric configuration
of the newly formed glycosidic linkage. In the ESI–mass spectrum,
the molecular ion peak at 2392.1440 [M+ Na]+ was observed
as the base peak.

Conversion of the linear pentasaccharide monomer 5 to glycosyl donor 6 was conducted in sequential
steps
of (i) O-acylation of primary hydroxyl group at the
nonreducing end; (ii) deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl
moiety at the anomeric carbon; (iii) O-acylation
at anomeric lactol functionality; (iv) reaction with p-thiocresol; and (v) O-deacetylation at the nonreducing
end (Scheme 2). Purification
(SiO2) (pet. ether/EtOAc linear gradient) was conducted
after five sequential steps. Appearance of a resonance at 5.66 ppm
(J = 5.2 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum of 6 corresponded to the anomeric proton (Hα-1). The corresponding Hβ-1 anomeric proton merged
with a set of other protons. The anomeric carbon of thioglycoside 6 appeared at 88.0 and 87.5 ppm in the 13C NMR
spectrum, corresponding to anomeric Cβ-1 and Cα-1, respectively. In the ESI–mass spectrum of 6, the molecular ion peak appeared at 2378.0710 [M + Na]+.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Glycosidic-Bond-Expanded Cyclic Pentasaccharide 7
Reagents and conditions: (i)
Ac2O, pyridine, DMAP, 0 °C to rt, 3 h; (ii) CF3COOH, CH2Cl2/H2O, 0 °C
to rt, 10 h, (iii) Ac2O, pyridine, DMAP, 0 °C to rt,
4 h; (iv) p-thiocresol, BF3·OEt2, CH2Cl2, rt, 11 h; (v) NaOMe, MeOH,
rt, 5 h, 72% (after steps i–v); (vi) NIS, TfOH, CH2Cl2, MS (4 Å), 0 °C to rt, 2 h; (vii) H2, Pd/C (10%), MeOH, 40 oC, 48 h, 67% (after two
steps).

Having secured the glycosidic-bond-expanded
linear pentasaccharide 6, possessing suitable glycosyl
donor and acceptor functionalities
at the reducing and nonreducing ends, respectively, the one-pot cycloglycosylation
was undertaken. The cycloglycosylation reaction of 6 
was conducted in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide/triflic
acid (NIS/TfOH), in CH2Cl2, at 0 °C to
room temperature for 2 h, the reaction mixture was quenched with Et3N, worked-up and the crude product was purified (SiO2) (pet. ether/EtOAc, linear gradient), to afford the O-benzyl-protected cyclic pentasaccharide in 76% yield. In ESI–mass
spectrum, the molecular ion peak at 2254.3838 [M+ Na]+ ascertained
the formation of the product. The O-benzyl-protected
derivative was subjected to deprotection (H2, Pd/C, MeOH),
followed by purification (SiO2) (CHCl3/MeOH
linear gradient), leading to secure free-hydroxyl group containing
cyclic pentasaccharide 7 in 90% yield (Scheme 2). The structural homogeneity
of 7 was confirmed by 1H, 13C,
correlation spectroscopy, and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence
NMR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry. Appearance of resonances
at 4.91 ppm as a doublet (J = 2.8 Hz) and at 98.6
ppm in 1H and 13C NMR spectrum corresponded
to the anomeric proton and carbon, respectively. Further, resonances
corresponding to each of the remaining proton and carbon nuclei were
seen completely symmetric. For example, in proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum, each individual resonance corresponded to one particular
carbon present in all five sugar moieties. In the ESI–mass
spectrum of 7, the molecular ion peak appeared at 903.3325,
as a Na-adduct. The cycloglycosylation favored only the intramolecular
reaction, leading to cyclic pentasaccharide formation, with none of
the intermolecular glycosylation product formation. The preponderance
for the intramolecular cyclization of linear pentasaccharide suggests
a preorganization of the molecule in a manner that enables the donor
and acceptor reactive sites, i.e., the reducing and nonreducing sugar
moieties, to be geometrically closer. Such a geometrical orientation
of the molecule is necessary for cyclization, which leads to the formation
of the 30-membered macrocyclic ring as in 7.

To
identify the molecular dimension of cyclic pentasaccharide 7, molecular modeling study was performed to obtain an energy-minimized
structure using Gaussian 09 software at the Becke 3–Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP)/6-311g level.32 The resulting energy-minimized
structure is shown in Figure 1. Each individual sugar conformation is observed to retain
the 4C1 conformation. The distances between
glycosidic oxygens of two adjacent sugar residues ranged between 4.08
and 6.25 Å, the variation in the distances deviates considerably
as compared to O1–O4 distance of 4.4 Å in glucose.33 Incorporation of additional methylene leads
to consequent variations in the interglycosidic bond distances. The
distances between the glycosidic oxygens of two adjacent sugar residues
and the remaining distances between the defined carbons of one pyranoside
to the neighboring pyranoside show variations, which lead to a distorted
ellipsoid structure (Figure 1a). The C-5–C-6 conformation about O-5 and C-4 is found
to be gg to all sugar residues. Whereas secondary hydroxyl groups
at C-2 and C-3 occupy one rim of the macrocycle, all five primary
hydroxyl groups at C-6 occupy the other side of the rim (syn-type).
The modeling study reveals that the larger rim possesses the primary
hydroxyl groups, whereas the smaller rim is occupied by the secondary
hydroxyl groups. Further, a lower rim size, as measured by connecting
the C-3 atom of each sugar moiety, is ∼86% that of the upper
rim, as measured through connecting the C-5 atom of each sugar moiety
(Figure 1b). The distances
between the atoms of the neighboring and alternate pyranoside rings
are given in Table 1. In comparison to earlier studies on cyclic trisaccharide, the shape
of the pentasaccharide macrocycle is markedly different. Whereas the
cyclic trisaccharide adopted a perfect trigonal shape with a 3-fold
symmetry,31 the corresponding cyclic tetrasaccharide30 was less regular than the cyclic trisaccharide.
Further, unlike in the case of the trisaccharide, which followed the
positioning of primary and secondary hydroxyl groups at the lower
and upper rims of the cone, respectively, as in naturally occurring
CDs, cyclic pentasaccharide 7 shows a reverse trend,
similar to that in the case of cyclic tetrasaccharide.30 The primary and secondary hydroxyl groups are
situated at the wider and narrower rims, respectively. It is also
to be noted that both the cyclic tetra- and pentasaccharides show
lesser difference between the large and narrow rims, tend to be ellipsoid
in shape, as opposed to a regular cone shape of the CDs and the cyclic
trisaccharide. Absence of a fold-symmetry between the sugar residues
for the cyclic pentasaccharide 7 might be accounted for
by differing φ and ψ angles around the glycosidic bond
between each neighboring sugar pairs. Interestingly, the distorted
ellipsoid structure of 7 compares well with the larger
nine-residue cyclodextrin (CD9).34

Subsequent to the synthesis and the structural study,
an assessment
of the guest-binding property of macrocycle 7 was undertaken.
In this instance, an isothermal titration calorimetric35 evaluation of the host–guest binding
efficacy was conducted. 1-Aminoadamantane was used as the ligand to
assess the binding properties of 7. This ligand was utilized
to assess the binding properties of cyclic trisaccharide and β-CD
earlier.31 The calorimetric titration was
performed using aqueous solutions of cyclic pentasaccharide 7 (0.45 mM) and ligand AMT (10 mM), in the cell and syringe,
respectively, at 30 °C. The titration was conducted until a saturation
of heat change occurred, when the ligand solution was added periodically
to the solution of 7, at intervals of 180 s. The thermogram
of the titration was analyzed after subtracting the heat of dilution.
The thermogram and the plot of the analysis of AMT–7 interaction are shown in Figure 2. The thermodynamic parameters governing the interaction
are given in Table 2. The analysis showed that the interaction occurred with a binding
constant (Ka) of 1.05 × 104 (±425) M–1 and the Wiseman constant (c)35 of 9.89. The stoichiometry
of AMT-to-7 was seen to be 1.8. A close to 2:1 guest-to-host
ratio suggests that one macrocycle 7 possesses a dynamic
binding with two AMT molecules in the cavity. This observation of
guest-to-host ratio is distinctly different from the previously assessed
interaction of glycosidic-bond-expanded cyclic trisaccharide with
AMT, wherein an 1:1 binding stoichiometry was observed, even when
changes in enthalpy, entropy, and free energy were comparable to both
cyclic trisaccharide and 7 binding to AMT. A comparison
to β-CD also shows that β-CD binds to AMT in a 1:1 binding
stoichiometry.31 AMT has a molecular dimension
of 2.87 Å × 2.92 Å,31 whereas 7 has the following farthest and shortest distances between
two pyranosidic ring atoms: primary C-5 hydroxymethyl methine rim
10.40 and 7.88 Å and secondary C-3 hydroxymethine rim 9.33 and
4.51 Å. These dimensions of AMT and 7 might permit
a snug fit of two molecules of AMT at the cavity of one molecule of 7. Further, both sides of the rims do not differ drastically
in their sizes, and these comparable sizes suggest that two molecules
of AMT might bind to 7, one each from each side of the
rim. Alternatively, both AMT molecules might prefer to bind 7 from same face of the macrocycle. The K value of 1.05 × 104 M–1 also suggests
a considerable guest–host binding efficacy. We surmise that
the larger ring size may lead the macrocycle to be more flexible and
even better facilitation of the dynamic binding of the guest, when
compared to the rigid cyclic trisaccharide or β-CD macrocycles.

Conclusions
Glycosidic-bond-expanded cyclic oligosaccharides emerge as a new
series of unnatural cyclic oligosaccharides. Incorporation of additional
methylene in between the glycosidic bond causes the macrocyclic ring
size to become larger, even when the number of pyranosidic residues
is lesser, in comparison to naturally occurring CDs with similar macrocyclic
pyranosidic residues. In the present work, synthesis of glycosidic-bond-expanded
cyclic pentasaccharide is reported. The synthesis relies on the chemical
glycosylation technique involving appropriately derivatized trisaccharide
glycosyl donor and disaccharide glycosyl acceptor, leading to the
formation of a linear pentasaccharide. The linear pentasaccharide
is utilized subsequently in a cycloglycosylation reaction, followed
by global deprotection reaction, to afford free hydroxyl group containing
cyclic pentasaccharide. The glycosidic-bond-expanded cyclic pentasaccharide
possesses a distorted elliptical structure, as adjudged through molecular
modeling evaluation. Further, the primary hydroxyl groups constitute
the larger rim, whereas the secondary hydroxyl groups are located
at the narrower rim. Assessment of the host–guest property
reveals that the cyclic pentasaccharide complexes with AMT in a 1:2
host-to-guest ratio. Combined with our earlier reports on cyclic tri-
and tetrasaccharides, the synthesis and studies on the cyclic pentasaccharide
herein add to the repertoire of unnatural cyclic oligosaccharides,
opening up alternate possibilities on cyclic oligosaccharides other
than the most commonly used cyclodextrins.

Modeling Studies
The energy-minimized structure of
the glycosidic-bond-expanded cyclic pentasaccharide 7 was derived by modeling studies using density functional theory.
The calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 suites of quantum
chemical program.32 The hybrid Becke 3–Lee–Yang–Parr
(B3LYP) exchange correlation functional was employed to predict the
minimum-energy molecular geometries of the compound. The geometries
were fully optimized in the gas phase at the B3LYP level of theory
by using the 6-311g basis set. Frequency calculations were performed
on each optimized structure using the same basis set to ensure that
it was a minimum on the potential energy surface. The lowest-energy
conformer from ab initio calculations was used to derive the final
bond parameters.

ITC Studies
Isothermal titration
calorimetric studies
on the binding interactions between host and guest molecules were
carried out by MicroCal ITC200 instrument. All the experiments
were performed at 30 °C in MilliQ-water. The reference cell was
filled with MilliQ-water, whereas the sample cell (200 μL) was
filled with host molecule (7) dissolved in water and
the syringe (40 μL) was filled with guest compound (1-aminoadamantane)
in an aqueous solution. The number of injections of guest compound
was 13 for each experiment, where each injection contained 3 μL
of the injectant. The spacing between two injections was 3 min and
the syringe stirring speed was kept at 750 rpm during the titrations.
Reference experiment (guest vs water) was performed under the same
condition. The heat changes in the sample experiment were subtracted
from the heat of dilution in the reference experiment to derive the
final thermodynamic data for the binding interactions. The isotherm
was fitted to one site binding model available in MicroCal analysis
software using Origin 7.0 and the thermodynamic parameters were identified.
