The
extraction of lanthanide series by Cyanex301, i.e.,
bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)dithiophosphinic acid (HC301), has been
modeled by density functional theory calculation, taking into account
the formation of both inner- and outer-sphere complexes. The inner-sphere
complex Ln(C301)3 and the outer-sphere complex Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are optimized, followed by
the analysis of interaction energy, bond length, Laplacian bond orders,
and Mulliken populations. The covalency degree increases in Ln–S
and Ln–O bonds in the inner- and outer-sphere complexes, respectively,
as the lanthanide series is traversed. Mulliken population analysis
indicates the important role of the 5d-orbital participation in bonding
in the formation of inner- and outer-sphere complexes. Two thermodynamic
cycles regarding the formation of inner- and outer-sphere complexes
are established to calculate the extraction Gibbs free energies (ΔGextr), and relaxed potential energy surface
scan is utilized to model the kinetic complexation of C301 anion with
hydrated metal ions. Light lanthanides can form both inner- and outer-sphere
complexes, whereas heavy lanthanides only form outer-sphere complexes
in biphasic extraction. After adopting the data of forming inner-sphere
complex for light Ln(III) and that of forming outer-sphere complexes
for heavy Ln(III), the trend of the calculated −ΔGextr agrees very well with that of the experimental
distribution ratios on crossing the Ln(III) series. Results from this
work help to theoretically understand the extraction behavior of Cyanex301
with respect to different Ln(III).

Introduction
Lanthanides are a group
of important strategic resources essential
for varied areas, such as electronics, luminescence, catalysis, and
magnetism, utilized almost everywhere in our modern life.1,2 The trivalent Ln(III) ions are dominant in both solution and solid
state in most systems. However, the ionic radius of Ln(III) reduces
only 0.15 Å on crossing the series due to the lanthanide contraction.
Thus, the physicochemical properties of Ln(III) are very similar,
which brings about difficulties in separation of Ln(III). Similar
situation is also encountered in the separation of Ln(III) from trivalent
minor actinides (An = Am and Cm). The separation of Ln(III) from one
another as well as from An(III) has received worldwide attention.3,4 For now, considerable interests are still remained to develop new
separation techniques, mainly focusing on seeking for organic or inorganic
ligands with high efficiency and selectivity and evaluating the nature
of lanthanide/actinide ligand bonding and the corresponding electronic
structure.5−8

In 1995, Zhu et al. found that purified Cyanex301, i.e., bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)dithiophosphinic
acid (denoted as HC301, Figure 1), which is a S-donor ligand, could selectively extract Am(III)
from Ln(III) with an extremely high separation factor over 1000.9 Since then, a number of experiments have been
carried out to investigate the extraction behaviors and, especially,
to identify of the extracted complexes of both An(III) and Ln(III)
in organic phase.10−18 It was demonstrated by Jensen et al. that the structure and metal–donor
atom bond distances are indistinguishable within experimental error
for similarly sized trivalent lanthanide and actinide cations, despite
the extraordinary selectivity of HC301 for trivalent actinide cations
over trivalent lanthanide cations.10 In
the extraction of the lanthanides series by HC301, however, our group
previously observed different extracted complexes for different lanthanides
under the same extraction condition.14 The
light Ln(III) are mainly coordinated by the sulfur atoms of the ligands
(inner-sphere complexes), and the middle Ln(III) are coordinated by
mixed donors, the sulfur atoms of the ligands and the oxygen atoms
of the extracted water, whereas the heavy Ln(III) are completely hydrated
in the organic phase without any sulfur atoms of the ligands in the
coordination shell (outer-sphere complexes). Furthermore, even for
light Ln(III), such as Nd(III), water molecules are able to replace
C301 anions in the first coordination shell to coordinate with the
metal ions at high neutralization degree, forming outer-sphere complexes
and even more complicated supramolecular aggregations in organic phase,
i.e., water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsions.16 W/O microemulsions were also evidenced in the extraction of heavy
Ln(III). The coordination environments of the heavy Ln(III) are identical
along with the increase of neutralization degree.17 These studies indicate the complexity of the extraction
of Ln(III) by Cyanex301, but to date, there has been no study to explain
the different coordination behavior of Cyanex301 with respect to different
Ln(III). Such dramatic differences must be related to the intrinsic
properties of different lanthanide ions when they interact with C301
anions, which is imperative to be illuminated.

HC301.

Density functional theory (DFT)
calculation is a very powerful
tool to predict and understand the coordination and extraction behavior
of ligands in organic solvent toward metal ions in aqueous solution,
especially in simulating the extraction separation process containing
lanthanides and actinides,19−24 although there are still some challenges due to the difficulties
especially in treating relativistic effect and the f-electron correlation
effects. Theoretical investigation on the extraction of Ln(III) or
An(III) with Cyanex301 has been carried out by DFT calculations, to
clarify the structure of the extracted complexes25−31 and to correlate the extraction properties with the electronic structure
variations of the ligands.32−34 For example, Cao and co-workers
carried out an excellent work of DFT calculation on the separation
of An(III) (An = Am and Cm) from Eu(III) with Cyanex301.27 The results showed that the neutral complexes
M(C301)3, where the C301 anion acts as a bidentate ligand
and the metal ion is coordinated by six sulfur atoms, were likely
the most stable extraction complexes, consistent with the experimental
results reported by Jensen and co-workers.10 Furthermore, they obtained much more negative changes of Gibbs free
energies for An(III) in the extraction reaction M3+ + 3HC301
→ M(C301)3 + 3H+, in line with the thermodynamical
priority for An(III).

In contrast to a relatively large number
of investigations on the
comparison of the extraction between An(III) and Ln(III) with Cyanex301,
less attention has been paid to the theoretical calculation on the
extraction of different Ln(III),25,26,28 not to mention the whole series of Ln(III). However,
identical complexes for different Ln(III) were reported in the theoretical
calculation, which was in contrast to the experimental results. Considering
the pronounced differences in the extraction behavior of Cyanex301
across the Ln series in experimental study, it is urgent to find the
relationship between extraction behavior and molecular/electronic
structure of the extracted Ln(III) complexes by theoretical computations.
This is also meaningful from the application aspect because there
are several kinds of lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel. Understanding
the mechanism of the extraction of different Ln(III) by Cyanex301
will be helpful for optimizing the process in lanthanide and actinide
separation.

In this work, we present a DFT calculation on the
extraction of
Ln(III) series by purified Cyanex301. We first optimize the geometry
of inner- and outer-sphere complexes of Ln(III) with Cyanex301, followed
by the analysis of the molecular and electronic structure, such as
interaction energy, bond length, Laplacian bond orders (LBOs), and
Mulliken populations. Then, we calculate the changes of Gibbs free
energy in the extraction of Ln(III) by Cyanex301 based on two established
thermodynamic cycles, which take into account the formation of inner-
and outer-sphere complexes. Finally, the variation of the calculated
extraction Gibbs free energy on crossing the lanthanide series is
compared to that of the corresponding distribution ratio in extraction
experiment. We believe that results in this work will theoretically
deepen the understanding of the coordination and extraction behavior
of Cyanex301 with regard to different Ln(III).

Results and Discussion
Structures
of Ln(C301)3 and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3
The complexation of Ln(III) with
C301 was considered in two ways, i.e., inner- and outer-sphere complexes.
The inner-sphere complexes of Eu(III) with C301 have been reported
in the literature.27 The results indicate
that the structures of HM(C301)4 are slightly higher in
energy than the separated M(C301)3 and HC301 systems. Given
that the ionic radii of Ln(III) are very close to each other, the
most stable complex Eu(C301)3 was extrapolated to all other
Ln(III) complexes in the present work. As to the outer-sphere complexes,
Ln(III) first coordinates with water molecules in the first coordination
shell and the hydrated Ln(III) then interacts with C301 by hydrogen
bonding. The hydration of Ln(III) has been investigated widely by
experimental characterizations and also by theoretical calculations,35−38 but there are still some controversies on the hydration number of
Ln(III). Nevertheless, the hydrated complexes Ln(H2O)93+ were studied in all cases in this work. In outer-sphere
complexes, only three C301 anions were included to examine their interactions
with Ln(H2O)93+, forming Ln(H2O)9(C301)3. We note that adding one
or more neutral HC301 molecules might make the outer-sphere complexes
more stabilized, but this would be too expensive to be calculated
by our limited computing resource, as there have been already nearly
200 atoms in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3. Another
reason that we did not include HC301 in the outer-sphere complexes
is, under an extraction condition with 100% neutralization degree,
all HC301 are neutralized to C301 anions and the hydrated Ln(III)
interact with only three C301 anions without HC301 molecules.16 This interaction was also observed in a homogeneous
medium.18 In combination, no neutral HC301
molecules were included in the outer-sphere complexes.

Typical
structures for the complexes Ln(C301)3 and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are shown in Figure 2. For the structure of Ln(C301)3 with sixfold metal coordination, the lanthanide ions are located
nearly in the plane defined by the three phosphor atoms from the three
C301 anions. However, we found no C3 symmetry
for Ln(C301)3 as geometry optimizations were carried out
without symmetry constraints. This is somewhat different from the
results reported by Cao and co-workers, in which the application of
two basis sets both led to C3 symmetry
as determined from the results of geometry optimization within C1 and C3 symmetries.27 Such difference should be attributed to the
different software or the different basis sets. Nevertheless, Eu–S
bond length as averaged in Eu(C301)3 is 2.842 ± 0.008
Å in our calculations, nearly identical to the value of 2.841
Å calculated with the basis set def2-TZVP for C, H, S, and P
atoms by Cao and co-workers. These results also suggest that using
relatively small basis sets for C and H atoms in the alkyl chain of
C301 insignificantly influences the Ln–S bond length in Ln(C301)3 complexes. The calculated bond lengths of Nd–S and
Sm–S are 2.890 and 2.857 Å, respectively, a little longer
than the available experimental values (2.852 and 2.803 Å) obtained
by Jensen and co-workers.10 For the structure
of Ln(H2O)9(C301)3, C301 anions no
longer coordinate with the Ln(III) ions but form hydrogen bonding
with the water molecules in the first coordination shell, resulting
in a slight distortion of the three-capped trigonal prism structure
of Ln(H2O)93+ in the core. The structures
of the inner- and outer-sphere complexes across the lanthanide series
were further analyzed by interaction energy (Eint), bond length, Laplacian bond orders, and Mulliken populations.

Figure 2 Calculated
structures of Ln(C301)3 and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3.

The interaction energies for the formation of inner- and
outer-sphere
complexes are defined by eqs 1 and 2, respectively. 1   2  where Emin is
the electronic energy in the minimum-energy geometry. The obtained
results for Eint are shown in Figure 3. The interaction
energy in the inner-sphere complex decreases from −3875 to
−4278 kJ/mol, whereas that in the outer-sphere complex decreases
from −2310 to −2376 kJ/mol, as the metal ion crossed
from La to Lu. This result suggests the stronger interaction of C301
anion with heavy Ln(III) compared to light Ln(III) in both the formation
of inner- and outer-sphere complexes. This is readily understood,
as the charge density increases along the lanthanide series in both
Ln(III) ion and hydrated Ln(III) ion would induce stronger electrostatic
attraction to the negative C301 anion.

for the formation of inner-sphere complex
Ln(C301)3 and outer-sphere complex Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 across the lanthanide series.

The variations of the average bond lengths for
Ln–S in the
inner-sphere complex Ln(C301)3 and for Ln–O in the
outer-sphere complex Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are presented in Table 1. Not surprisingly, the values for these bond lengths decrease
with the increase in atomic number due to the decrease of the ionic
radius of Ln(III) across the lanthanide series. After subtracting
the value of the ionic radius of Ln(III), the data of RLn–S – RLn in
Ln(C301)3 and RLn–O – RLn in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are also shown in Table 1. In general, a very slight decrease trend along the
lanthanide series can be found in both cases. The bond length analysis
can provide some information to some extent about the bonding nature
between metal ions and ligands, such as the covalency. Usually, shorter
bond length means higher covalency degree. The descendant trends in
the values of RLn–S – RLn in Ln(C301)3 and RLn–O – RLn in
Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 suggest the increase
of covalency degree in the bonding of lanthanide with both sulfur
in C301 anion and oxygen in water molecules as the lanthanide series
crossed. This can be further verified by electron density at bond
critical points (CPs), Laplacian bond orders (LBOs), and Mulliken
orbital populations.

As shown in Figure 4A, the electron densities at the CPs of both the Ln–S bond
in Ln(C301)3 and the Ln–O bond in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 increase along the lanthanide series,
signaling increasing bond strengths and increased covalency degree.
This can be further demonstrated by Laplacian bond order.

density at CPs and (B) LBOs of Ln–S bonds in
Ln(C301)3 (black squares) and Ln–O bonds in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 (red circles).

The Laplacian bond order (LBO) is defined as 3  where A and B stand for atoms, ρ is
the electron density, and w is a function determining
the region of the atom by Becke’s scheme.39 The prefactor −10 is introduced to make the magnitude
of LBO consistent with one’s chemical intuition for typical
covalent bonds. LBO only reflects the covalent component of a bond
because ∇2ρ < 0 means that the electron
density is locally concentrated, suggesting the covalent interaction. Figure 4B shows the variation
of LBOs of Ln–S bonds in Ln(C301)3 and Ln–O
bonds in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3. It can
be seen that both of them linearly increase along the lanthanide series,
indicating the increase of covalency degree. The values of LBOs of
Ln–O bonds in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are comparable to those in Ln(III) aqua complexes,38 whereas those of Ln–S bonds in Ln(C301)3 are much higher, indicating higher covalency degree in Ln–S
bonds.

Mulliken orbital populations can reflect some physical
features
for similar species under identical calculation procedures, although
it is known to be basis set-dependent. Particularly, this method has
been applied in the estimation of the covalency of metal–ligand
bonding within f-elements complexes.28,40 The results
of Mulliken orbital populations (6s, 6p, and 5d) and atomic charges
on Ln in both the inner-sphere complex Ln(C301)3 and the
outer-sphere complex Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are shown in Figure 5. In general, considerable 6s, 6p, and 5d occupations are observed
for both the inner- and outer-sphere complexes on crossing the lanthanide
series, which indicate the metal–ligand bonding contributions
from these shells. In detail, the 6s occupations are very similar
in the complexes of Ln(C301)3 and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3, both increasing with the increase in atomic
number. An increase tendency in 6p occupations is also observed for
both the complexes, and 6p occupations for Ln in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 are a little higher than those in Ln(C301)3. The most striking difference occurs in the 5d occupation.
The 5d occupation for Ln in Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 increases with the atomic number, similarly to 6s and 6p
occupations. Differently, it shows a generally decrease tendency in
the case of Ln(C301)3. A similar trend was also observed
by Löble et al. when they studied the covalency degree in Ln–Cl
bond by examining the complexes of lanthanide hexachloride.41 In combination, the atomic charges on Ln in
both Ln(C301)3 and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 decrease as atomic number increased, with a more slightly
decreasing tendency in the variation for Ln(C301)3. Lower
Mulliken charges on metal center imply more charge transfer from ligand
to metal, thus indicating higher covalency degree in metal–ligand
bonding. This is consistent with the trends in electron densities
at CPs and LBOs in Figure 4. Besides, it can be seen that the 5d occupation is much larger
than 6s and 6p occupations in both Ln(C301)3 and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 complexes, indicating the
more significant role of the 5d shells in bonding in the complexation
of Ln(III) with C301 and water molecules.

(6s, 6p, and 5d) and atomic charge
on the metal center Ln in the complexes of Ln(C301)3 (black
squares) and Ln(H2O)9(C301)3 (red
circles).

We are aware that some studies
have reported that the 5d electrons
contribute largely in covalency bonding of Ln ligands.7,41−43 In our case, the significant contribution of 5d electrons
in the metal–ligand bond is largely responsible for the formation
of inner- and outer-sphere complexes. Contrary to the previous speculation
of decrease in covalency degree on the formation of inner- and outer-sphere
complexes between lanthanides series and C301 anion in a homogeneous
solution,18 the heavy lanthanides are capable
of forming stronger covalent bonds with C301 anions compared to the
light lanthanides. The competition of water molecules with C301 anion
induces different complexes for light and heavy lanthanides. In addition,
contributions of 6s and 6p orbitals in the metal–ligand bonding
should not be neglected, and we believe that, in the future, more
efforts will be made to examine the role of 5d, 6s, and 6p orbitals
of Ln in coordinating with diversified ligands containing O, S, and
N donors, which are normally used in the extraction separation of
trivalent actinides and lanthanides.5

Extraction Gibbs Free Energy
For the extraction of
Ln(III) by HC301 forming inner-sphere complexes, the extraction equation
is 4  whereas for the extraction
forming outer-sphere
complexes, the extraction equation is 5  If
the hydration of Ln(III) is treated explicitly, eqs 4 and 5 can be rewritten
as eqs 6 and 7, respectively. 6   7  The change of extraction Gibbs free energy
for eqs 6 and 7 can be obtained from the thermodynamic cycles, as
shown in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. The water
cluster (H2O)9 is used in the thermodynamic
cycle, which shows more accurate solvation free energies than those
using monomer cycle with nine distinct water molecules as reagents
according to the literature.44 HC301, Ln(H2O)93+, and the water cluster (H2O)9 were all optimized. Their final structures
are shown in Figure S1. The structure of
Ln(H2O)93+ is of three-capped trigonal
prism, consistent with the result obtained by Ciupka and co-workers.36 For (H2O)9, only the structure
with global minima in energy, i.e., the nonamer with one water molecule
hydrogen bonded to the cubic octamer,45−48 is used in calculating the extraction
Gibbs free energy. The hydration energy of H+ was not calculated
but used the experimental value of −1104.5 kJ/mol.49 ΔG°→* is the energy change of 1 mol of an ideal gas from 1 atm (24.46
L/mol) to 1 mol/L at 298.15 K, and its value is 7.92 kJ/mol according
to the literature.50,51 The concentration of (H2O)9 in liquid water is 6.15 mol/L; thus, a correction
term of ΔGl→* is added. Its
value for (H2O)9 was calculated to be −4.5
kJ/mol. The components for the calculation of extraction Gibbs free
energy are all tabulated in Supporting Information (Tables S1–S6).

As shown in Table 2, both the extraction Gibbs
free energies obtained from Schemes 1 and 2 descend monotonously as the atomic
number of Ln(III) increased. In general, the values of extraction
Gibbs free energy for the formation of inner-sphere complex are lower
than those for the formation of outer-sphere complex. The energy gap
between the extraction Gibbs free energies for the formation of inner-
and outer-sphere complexes is about 20 kJ/mol for all Ln(III).

As can be seen from Schemes 1 and 2, the
difference in the change of extraction Gibbs free energies for different
Ln originates from the Gibbs free energy of the reaction in gas phase
(ΔGextr,gas) and the solvation energy
(ΔGsolv) of the extracted complexes
(Ln(C301)3 or Ln(H2O)9(C301)3) in organic phase and of Ln(H2O)93+ in aqueous phase. Using La extraction system as a reference,
the difference of these three components is illustrated in Figure 6. For the formation
of both inner- and outer-sphere complexes, the fraction of ΔΔGextr,gas shows the most significant difference,
followed by the solvation energy of Ln(H2O)93+ in aqueous phase. The contribution of the solvation
energy of the extracted complexes is much smaller than that of the
above two fractions. This is a little inconsistent with the findings
for the separation of Am(III) and Eu(III) reported by Cao and co-workers,
where the difference between the hydration energies for Am(III) and
Eu(III) appears to be the decisive contribution for the observed preference
of Cyanex301 for complex formation with the actinides rather than
with the lanthanides.27 We also noted that
the theoretical calculations in the work by Keith and co-workers indicated
that the binding free energy of the ligands to metals is the primary
contribution to the separation effect in the selective extraction
of Am(III) and Eu(III) by two dithiophosphinic acids with different
substituent groups.29 These findings, in
combination, suggest the complicated performance of dithiophosphinic
acids in the extraction separation of trivalent lanthanides and actinides,
which depends on varied factors such as metal-ion species and substituent
groups.

Figure 6 Difference of the components (solvation energy of extracted complexes
in organic phase, solvation energy of hydrated Ln(III) in aqueous
phase, and the reaction Gibbs free energy in gas phase) in the calculated
Gibbs free energy based on (A) Scheme 1 and (B) Scheme 2 on crossing the lanthanide series. The La(III) extraction
system is used as a reference.

It should be noted that the results in Table 2 show a monotonous decrease in the extraction
Gibbs free energies for the formation of both inner- and outer-sphere
complexes. However, as can be seen from Schemes 1 and 2, only the situations before and after the extraction of metal
ions are modeled. That is, the kinetic process for the penetration
of metal ions from aqueous phase into organic phase accompanied by
the complexation of C301 anions with metal ions is not considered
in the calculation of extraction Gibbs free energy. It must be admitted
that the actual reaction mechanism of extraction process is too complex
to be modeled by quantum chemical methods, and such a process might
be successfully revealed by other theoretical methods, such as molecular
dynamics with reactive force field. However, this has gone beyond
the subject of this work. Nevertheless, we, in this work, used a relaxed
potential energy surface (PES) scan method to preliminarily study
the interaction of C301 anions with hydrated lanthanide ions, to see
the process of replacement of water molecules by C301 anions. This
cannot exactly simulate the actual extraction process, but it can
indeed provide some useful information about the dynamic extraction
process from thermodynamic aspect. The relaxed PES scan was carried
out along the distance between the phosphor atom in C301 anion and
the lanthanide atom in Ln(H2O)93+ in 24 steps from 5.3 to 3.0 Å. Two lanthanide ions were selected
in the relaxed PES scan, the representative of light lanthanides,
Nd(III), and that of heavy lanthanides, Ho(III). The potential curves
in the PES scan and the corresponding structures for selected Ln–P
distances are summarized in Figure 7. It should be noted that, as C301 anion is progressively
close to the Ln(III) ions, sulfur atoms of C301 anion replace water
molecules to directly coordinate with Ln(III). In this context, the
water molecules released will form hydrogen bonding with the water
molecules remained in the first coordination shell, which makes the
structure hard to be optimized successfully. Therefore, once a water
molecule was released from the first coordination shell of Ln(III),
it would be omitted from the relaxed PES scan. This treatment is actually
very close to the actual process of the extraction occurred at the
interface area between aqueous phase and organic phase, in which the
water molecules replaced by C301 anions in coordination with Ln(III)
remain in aqueous phase along with the partitioning of Ln(III).

Figure 7 Relative energies
and selected structures in the relaxed potential
energy surface scan for the Ln–P (Ln = Nd and Ho) distance
in the interaction between Ln(H2O)93+ and C301 anion.

For the interaction of
C301 anion with Nd(H2O)93+ in the
PES scan as depicted in Figure 7, C301 anion interacts with Nd(H2O)93+, forming a outer-sphere complex (Nd-1)
at a Nd–P distance of 5.0 Å. The C301 anion
replaces one water molecule by coordinating Nd(III) with one sulfur
atom, forming a low-energy complex (Nd-2) at a Nd–P
distance of 4.5 Å. Further closing C301 anion to Nd(III) induces
another low-energy complex (Nd-3) at a Nd–P distance
of 3.6 Å. In this structure, two water molecules are replaced
by two sulfur atoms from the C301 anion in the first coordination
shell of Nd(III). The energy gap between Nd-1 and Nd-3 is about 79.0 kJ/mol, indicating that the substitution
of H2O by C301 anion in interaction with hydrated Nd(III)
is endothermic. This is in good agreement with the endothermic process
of the extraction of trivalent lanthanides by Cyanex301.52 The PES scan also interprets the phenomena in
the formation of W/O microemulsions reported by our group previously,
in which both C301 anions and water molecules can coordinate with
Nd(III), depending on the extraction conditions.16 As to the PES scan of Ho–P distance between Ho(H2O)93+ and C301 anion, the energy curve
is very different from that for Nd(III). Similarly, hydrated Ho(III)
can also form outer-sphere complex with C301 anion with a Ho–P
distance of 5.0 Å. Differently, as the phosphor atom of C301
anion further closing to Ho atom in Ho(H2O)93+, no low-energy structure was achieved. Especially,
the energy monotonously increases as Ho–P distance decreases
from 4.2 to 3.0 Å. This is also consistent with our observation
in the study of W/O microemulsions phenomena in extraction of Ho(III)
by HC301, that is, the sulfur atoms from the C301 anions cannot replace
the oxygen atoms from water molecules in the first coordination shell
of Ho(III).17 In short, the relaxed PES
scan demonstrates that light lanthanides can form both inner- and
outer-sphere complexes, whereas heavy lanthanides can only form outer-sphere
complexes with C301 in the presence of water molecules. Therefore,
the Gibbs free energies in the extraction of the Ln(III) series by
Cyanex301 should adopt different data corresponding to different metal-ion
species, as calculated in Schemes 1 and 2. Moreover, the extraction equilibrium constant for the formation
of inner- and outer-sphere complexes can be written as eqs 8 and 9, respectively. 8   9  Therefore, 10  where C is a constant
depending
on various factors, such as pH in aqueous phase, concentration of
metal ion in aqueous phase, concentration of HC301 in organic phase,
and neutralization degree. According to eq 10, the negative value of extraction Gibbs
free energy (−ΔGextr) is
proportional to the value of ln DLn. We compare the trend in the calculated −ΔGextr to that in the experimental ln DLn across the Ln(III) series, and the results are presented
in Figure 8. After
adopting the data of formation of inner- and outer-sphere complexes
for lighter and heavier lanthanides, respectively, the comparison
shows an excellent agreement between calculation and experiment. This
also further supports the validity of DFT calculation study on the
extraction of Ln(III) by Cyanex301. The difference in the calculated
−ΔGextr between different
Ln(III) ions is very small (for most Ln, the difference is less than
3 kJ/mol). There is a little discrepancy for the middle lanthanides,
mainly due to the transition from inner- to outer-sphere complexes
in the extracted species. The middle lanthanides may coordinate with
both water molecules and C301 anions simultaneously in the extraction
system, which is a transition-mode complex. This was not investigated
in our calculation, but one can infer from Figure 8 a formation of transition-mode complex for
Eu(III). This is in line with our previous observations in both extraction
system and homogeneous solution with high metal loading,14,18 but contrary to the results by using extended X-ray absorption fine
structure with very low metal loading.10 Once again, this reflects the complexity of the extraction system
using Cyanex301 as the extractant. In Figure 8, the calculated values of ΔGextr are all quite negative, whereas the distribution
ratios are all very small (from 0.64 to 1.72). This is because the
distribution ratios were determined at a very high metal-ion concentration
and a low neutralization degree. As aforementioned, the constant C in eq 10 is affected by these two factors. Actually, if we use a low metal-ion
concentration in aqueous phase relative to that of HC301 in organic
phase, the distribution ratios will be very high at a very high neutralization
degree.16

Figure 8 Comparison of the tendency in the calculated
−ΔGextr (filled squares)
and in the experimental
ln DLn on crossing the lanthanide
series without Pm. For lanthanides of 57–60, data of forming
inner-sphere complexes are adopted, whereas those of forming outer-sphere
complexes are adopted for 64–71. The adopted data are presented
in filled square form. The data of distribution ratio of Ln(III) are
adopted from ref (13), in which toluene is used as the diluent. In the left Y scale, the value of −ΔGextr is from 70 to 130 kJ/mol with a ΔΔGextr of 60 kJ/mol. According to eq 9, Δln DLn should be about 24, thus the right Y scale
is set in the range of −12 to 12.

Conclusions
The extraction of the Ln(III) series by
Cyanex301 is successfully
modeled by DFT calculation after considering the formation of both
inner- and outer-sphere complexes. The interactions between lanthanide
and C301 anion become stronger on crossing the lanthanide series in
both the inner- and outer-sphere complexes, due to the stronger electrostatic
attraction for C301 anion resulting from the greater charge density
on metal center and the higher covalency in Ln–S and Ln–O
bonds. All of the valence orbitals of 6s, 6p, and 5d contribute in
covalency, among which 5d orbitals play a critical role in forming
either inner- or outer-sphere complexes. As suggested by a relaxed
PES scan, the competition between water molecules and C301 anion induces
that light lanthanides can form both inner- and outer-sphere complexes,
whereas the heavy lanthanide can only form outer-sphere complexes
with C301 in the presence of water molecules. In the extraction Gibbs
free energies, data of the formation of inner- and outer-sphere complexes
are adopted for light and heavy lanthanides, respectively, and this
treatment agrees perfectly with the trends in experimental distribution
ratios across the lanthanide series. Results in this work also have
ramifications for the extraction separation of trivalent actinide
and lanthanide by using Cyanex301 and perhaps other ligands containing
O and N donors. Questions in the extraction separation of trivalent
actinide and lanthanide such as the formation of inner- and outer-sphere
extracted complexes and the role of valence orbitals (5d/6d, 6s/7s,
and 6p/7p, along with 4f/5f) in corresponding coordination behavior
are valuable to be answered in the future.

Computational Details
All theoretical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian
09 software package (revision C.01).53 The
generalized gradient approximation-type density functional BP86 was
used, in which the Hartree–Fock exchange energy was approximated
using the gradient-corrected exchange-energy function proposed by
Becke in 1988 and the electron correlation energy was approximated
using the density function proposed by Perdew in 1986.54,55 The BP86 functional has been demonstrated to be successful in calculation
of Ln(III) complexation with HC301.27,31,36,56 Standard def2-SVP basis
sets as implemented in the Gaussian program were used for C and H,
whereas standard def2-TZVP basis sets were used for S, P, and O atoms.
As to Ln(III), we noted that both small-core (4f-in-valence) and large-core
(4f-in-core) pseudopotentials (PPs) were utilized in the calculation
of the interaction between Ln(III) and HC301.27−29,31 The electron configuration of Ln(III) is [Xe]4f0–14. However, the 4f orbital of Ln(III) is historically
considered to be buried beneath the valence shell and participate
only marginally in bonding. Especially, a recent work by Kaneko et
al. demonstrated the nonbonding of f-orbital in the complex of Eu(Me2PS2)3.34 Furthermore,
Dolg et al. indicated that a number of popular density functionals
yield significantly too long bond distances for Eu(III)–X bonds
in unrestricted Kohn–Sham calculations, when X is a soft ligand
and the 4f shell is treated explicitly.30 Therefore, energy-consistent scalar-relativistic WB-adjusted 4f-in-core
PPs in combination with the corresponding (7s6p5d)/[5s4p3d] standard
basis sets were used for Ln(III) in this work.57−60

All of the structures were
optimized without imposing any symmetry
constraints. Optimized geometric structures were verified to be true
minima on the potential energy surfaces (PES) by vibrational frequency
analysis at the same level of theory. Calculations taking into account
solvation effects were carried out by using integral equation formalism
version of the polarizable continuum model.61 Toluene was used as the organic solvent. Wave function analyses,
such as electron densities, Laplacian bond orders (LBOs), and Mulliken
population analysis, were performed by the Multiwfn program.62
