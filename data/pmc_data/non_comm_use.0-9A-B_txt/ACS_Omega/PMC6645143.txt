After carefully analyzing
the Kamlet–Jacobs (K–J)
equations and the structural traits of well-known explosives, hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazin
(RDX), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and
hexanitrohexaazaisowurtizitane (CL-20), diverse nitramine explosives
including linear (Models IAn, IBn, and ICn), cyclic (Model IIn),
and caged (Models IIIAn and IIIBn) molecules were designed by incorporating various number (n) of −CH2NNO2– structural
unit and studied using the B3LYP/6-31G* and B3PW91/6-31G** methods
of the density functional theory. Computational results show that
all of the energetic parameters, that is, density (ρ), detonation
velocity (D), and detonation pressure (P), follow the order of IIIBn > IIIAn > IIn > IAn > IBn > ICn. With the increasing n,
the D and P of linear nitramines
eventually keep stable. This clearly indicates that elongating the
chain length (e.g., polymerization) brings little or even negative
benefit in boosting the explosive properties. The oxygen balance and
the K–J equation parameter ϕ both have a significant
influence on the detonation properties. Caged compound IIIA2 has not
only comparable energetic properties but also better sensitivity and
thermal stability than CL-20.

1 Introduction
High-energy
materials are generally organic compounds containing
functional groups such as nitro (−NO2), nitrate
ester (−ONO2), azido (−N3), nitramino
(−NNO2), and so on. To construct or synthesize a
new ideal explosive, some specific issues need to be paid attentions
to: (a) as high as possible detonation velocity, detonation pressure,
and density and acceptable level of stability in comparison with the
benchmark explosives and (b) environmentally compatible detonation
or combustion end products.1,2 Searching for the promising
high-energy materials during the last one decade has discovered a
large number of energetic oxidizers, fuels, and explosives.3−6

One of which is the so-called energetic nitro compounds, the
high-energy
materials with −NO2 groups, such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT),7 hexanitrobenzene,8 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene,9 2,2′,4,4′,6,6′-hexanitrostilbene,10 heptanitrocubane,11 octanitrocubane,11 and so on. The well-known
explosive TNT has been widely used in military, industrial, and mining
applications. Energetic nitrate esters with −ONO2 groups, such as nitroglycerine (NG)12 and penerythritol tetranitrate,13 have
been widely used in the military applications too. Combining NG with
nitrocellulose, hundreds of composites are produced and used by rifle,
pistol, and shotgun reloaders. Energetic azides with −N3 groups, such as 1,3-diazido-2-nitrazapropane, 1,5-diazido-2,4-dinitrazapentane,
1,7-diazido-2,4,6-trinitrazaheptane, and so on, are another kind of
energetic compounds which possess high density, positive heat of formation,
good thermal and hydrolytic stability, low impact sensitivity, high
burning rate, and reduced flash.15−17 Potential high-energy
azides include trinitroazetidine,19 hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
(RDX),20 octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine
(HMX),21 and hexanitrohexaazaisowurtizitane
(CL-20).22 The structures of the above-mentioned
famous explosives are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.

By observing the molecular structures
of the traditional famous
explosives, we noted that the geometries are ranging from linear to
cyclic to caged structures. Besides, energetic nitramines, RDX and
HMX, have similar molecular structures which are made up with the
identical basic structural unit (−CH2NNO2−). Many research studies23−26 are devoted to investigate the
derivatives of HMX and RDX. It is known that HMX has one additional
−CH2NNO2– unit, and it possesses
higher energetic performance than RDX. However, the specific contributions
of the −CH2NNO2– unit on the energetic
properties are not very clear. In this work, various nitramines, including
linear (Model I), cyclic (Model II), and caged (Model III) structures,
were constructed and studied using the density functional theory (DFT)
method. The molecular skeletons of all models are depicted in Figure 1. It aims to explore
the effect of −CH2NNO2– unit on
the energetic properties and screen the promising nitramines with
better performance than the benchmarks RDX, HMX, and CL-20.

This work is instructive to explore
the relationships between the
structures and properties of energetic nitramines. In addition to
the inherent interest in searching for potential new nitramine explosives,
the study on the linear nitramines can serve as precursors to understand
the effect of unit on the performance of the whole energetic polymers,
which has a certain significance in the field of developing energetic
binders.

2 Design Strategy and Theoretical Methods
Linear nitramines (Model IAn, Model IBn, and Model ICn, n =
0–8) were constructed by connecting −CH2NNO2– units one by one. For Model IAn,
both sides use H as the terminal. For Model IBn,
one side uses H as the terminal and the other side uses −CH3 as the terminal. For Model ICn, both sides
use −CH3 as the terminal. Its destination was to
determine how the basic unit affects the performance of energetic
polymers.

Cyclic nitramines (Model IIn, n = 1–8) were built by connecting −CH2NNO2– units into a loop. Its destination
was to examine
how different it can be between the linear and cyclic structures.

Caged nitramines (Model IIIAn, n = 1–8) were formed by connecting two identical cyclic molecules
into a two-layered cage. By the full consideration of the Kamlet–Jacobs
(K–J) eqs 1–3,27 Model IIIBn (n = 1–8) was constructed by inserting
O atoms into the C–C links of Model IIIAn to
evaluate how oxygen balance affects the energetic properties. It needs
to mention that Models IIIAn and IIIBn are our designed compounds, which have not been synthesized yet. 1   2   3  where D is the detonation
velocity (km/s); P is the detonation pressure (GPa);
ρ is the packed density of explosive (g/cm3); N is the moles of gas produced by per gram of explosive
(mol); Ma is the average molar weight
of detonation gas products (g/mol), and Q is the
energy of detonation (cal/g). N, Ma, and Q were determined according to
the largest exothermicity principle.27 The
detonation products of Models IAn, IBn, ICn, IIn, and IIIAn are N2, CO2, H2O, and C. The detonation
products of Model IIIBn are N2, CO2, and H2O. The specific calculated formulas of N, Ma, and Q are presented in Table 1.

All designed molecules were fully optimized at the
B3LYP/6-31G*
and B3PW91/6-31G** levels, and the molecular electrostatic potential
was calculated at the B3PW91/6-31G** level. Their initial structures
are constructed by consideration of the molecular symmetry and steric-hindrance
effect to try to make their relaxed structures with the minimum energy.
The optimized structures were characterized to be the energy minima
on the potential energy surface by vibrational analysis. These calculations
were carried out using the Gaussian program package28 and Multiwfn software.29 The
density was predicted by ρ1 = M/Vm first and then corrected by eq 4(30) 4  where M is the molecular
weight (g/mol); Vm is the average molar
volume within the 0.001 a.u. electron density contour (cm3/mol); ν is the degree of balance between positive and negative
potential on the molecular surface; σtot2 is a measure of variability of the electrostatic potential (kcal/mol)2; and the coefficients α1, β1, and γ1 are 0.9183, 0.0028, and 0.0443, respectively.30

The gas-phase heat of formation [ΔHf°(g)] was estimated
by designing isodesmic reactions, which has been proved to be an effective
way to predict the ΔHf°(g) and has been widely used in
previous studies.31−33 The designed isodemic reactions for all models are
as follows 5   6   7   8   9   10  

The reaction enthalpy (ΔHr) of
the above isodemic reactions at 298 K was calculated using the following
equation 11  where ΔHf,P° and
ΔHf,R° are the heats of formation of the products
and the reactants at
298 K, respectively. ΔE0 is the
difference between the total energy of the reactants and the products
at 0 K. ΔEZPV is the difference
between the zero-point vibrational energies of the reactants and the
products, and ΔHT is the thermal
enthalpy correction from 0 to 298 K. The experimental ΔHf°(g)s of CH4 (−74.6 kJ/mol34), CH3CH3 (−84.0 kJ/mol34), and CH3OCH3 (−184.1 kJ/mol34) are available. For CH3NNO2CH3, CH3NHNO2, CH3NNO2CH2CH2NNO2CH3,
and CH3NNO2CH2OCH2NNO2CH3 which lack experimental ΔHf°(g)s,
additional calculations were performed with the G3 method which can
predict the ΔHf° from the atomization reaction accurately.
The predicted ΔHf°(g)s of CH3NNO2CH3, CH3NHNO2, CH3NNO2CH2CH2NNO2CH3,
and CH3NNO2CH2OCH2NNO2CH3 are −5.053, 2.329, 11.006, and −115.703
kJ/mol, respectively.

The heat of formation in solid state [ΔHf°(s)]
and sublimation enthalpy (ΔHsub)
were then estimated using the following equations35 12   13  where AS is the
area of the isosurface of 0.001 e/Bohr3 electron density
of the molecule (Å2); the coefficients α2, β2, and γ2 at the B3PW91/6-31G**
level are 4.43 × 10–4, 2.0599, and −2.4825,
respectively.35

The sensitivity plays
a key role in determining the potential application
and handing safety of explosives. There are many ways to predict the
sensitivity, such as molecular surface electrostatic potentials, crystal
lattice free space (ΔV), and maximum heat of
detonation per unit volume (ρQmax).36−38 In this work, we used ΔV (Å3), ρQmax (kcal/cm3), and h50 (cm), the height from where
50% probability of the “drops” results in reaction of
the sample, to measure the impact sensitivity of all designed molecules.
ΔV and h50 were
predicted by formulas 14(39,40) and 15,41 respectively.
Generally, the sensitivity tends to increase as ΔV and ρQmax becomes large. 14  where Veff is
the effective volume of the molecule that would correspond to 100%
packing of the unit cell, which is usually quite similar to the 0.001
a.u. contour of the molecule’s electronic density. Vint is the space encompassed by the 0.003 a.u.
contour of the molecule’s electronic density. 15  

The coefficients
α3, β3, and
γ3 at the B3PW91/6-31G** level are −0.0064,
241.42, and −3.43, respectively.41

Thermal stability was examined by calculating the bond dissociation
energy (EBD) of all possible pyrolysis
processes. The formula is as follows 16  where A–B
stands
for the neutral molecule
and A• and B• stand for the corresponding radical products
after the dissociation of A–B bond; EA•, EB•, and EA–B are their corresponding
total energies after the correction of the zero-point energy.

3 Results and Discussion
The optimized molecular coordinates
of all models at the B3LYP/6-31G*
level are supplied in the Supporting Information. The calculated values of ρ1, ρ, ΔHf°(g), ΔHf°(s), D, P, and h50 for all models are tabulated
in Table 2. It is worth
noting that the predicted D and P using K–J equations are similar to those obtained using EXPLO5,
given in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. The variations of ρ, D, and P with n are plotted in Figure 2. Clearly, the rigid and highly compact caged
structures result in a highly dense and more powerful explosives,
and the orders of ρ, D, and P are Model IIIBn > Model IIIAn >
Model IIn > Model IAn > Model
IBn > Model ICn. The only exception
is that D and P of IIIB1 are a little
bit lower
than those of IIIA1. The order of ρ, D, and P is almost consistent with that of oxygen balance parameter
(POB). For the compounds with the formula
CaHbOcNd, POB equals to , as seen in 17−22. Obviously, POB follows
the order of Model IIIBn > Model IIIAn > Model IIn > Model IAn >
Model
IBn > Model ICn. However, POB is not the only factor, ϕ also has
a big influence on the D and P.
The higher ϕ of IIIA1 (7.4030) than that of IIIB1 (7.0056) makes
IIIA1 have higher D and P, even
though the POB of IIIA1 is lower than
that of IIIB1. That is to say, to improve the energetic properties,
both POB and ϕ should be taken into
consideration. The data of N, Ma, POB, and ϕ are listed
in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. 17   18   19   20   21   22

is a structural isomer of CL-20. ρ1 is the uncorrected
density calculated by M/Vm. ρ is the corrected density evaluated by ρ = αρ1 + β(νσtot2) + γ.

In linear models (Models IAn, IBn, and ICn), increasing n is equivalent
to polymerizing the molecular structure. The underlying purpose of
studying this model is to address a potential issue, that is, understanding
the contribution of the unit on the performance of the whole polymer.
The order of ρ, D, and P of
linear models is Model IAn > Model IBn > Model ICn, which tells us that the −CH3 group has a negative influence on the energetic properties. D and P of Models IBn and
ICn both increase until reaching flat, whereas those
of IAn increase first with n = 1
reaching the maximum and then decrease until keeping stable. Generally,
the higher density implies better performance. Why does this situation
in IAn happen? From IA0–IA1, ρ increases,
whereas POB and ϕ decrease. The
tiny increase in ρ cannot defend the decrease in POB and ϕ, thus, the energetic properties have a
trend to decrease. The best energetic properties of IA1 suggest that
for the analogues, the compounds with zero oxygen balance (POB = 1) have better performance than the ones
with positive oxygen balance (POB >
1)
and negative oxygen balance (POB <
1). In addition, when n → ∞, POB(IAn), POB(IBn), and POB(ICn) are infinitely closed to a definite value
(2/3); that is why ρ, D, and P of Models IAn, IBn, and ICn all eventually keep stable, which tells us that to increase
energetic properties of energetic polymers, elongating the chain length
infinitely is not an effective way, and sometimes it may decrease
performance.

In cyclic Model II, it can be seen that ρ, D, and P increase first and then decrease
with II5
possessing the maximum value (ρ = 1.878 g/cm3, D = 9.145 km/s, and P = 38.056 GPa). Model
IIn is formed by connecting Model IBn end to end, clearly; Model IIn has better energetic
properties than Model IBn, which implies that one
way to improve the energetic performance is making linear compounds
into a loop to construct the multicyclic compounds. Here, it should
be mentioned that II2 is RDX and II3 is HMX. Obviously, II4 and II5
have better energetic properties. To verify the reliability of our
adopted methods, the calculated and experimental data of RDX, HMX,
and CL-20 are summarized in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. The predicted ρs are slightly lower than
the experimental data. The calculated ρs of RDX, HMX, and CL-20
are 1.784, 1.850, and 1.945 g/cm3, respectively, and their
corresponding experimental data are 1.820,1 1.910,1 and 2.0401 g/cm3, respectively. The predicted ΔHf°(g)s
are quite similar with their reported data. The calculated ΔHf°(g)s are 209.165 kJ/mol for RDX and 278.948 kJ/mol for HMX, and their
reported data are 191.87835 and 263.700
kJ/mol,42 respectively. For RDX, the predicted D and P are similar to their experimental
ones, whereas for HMX and CL-20, the data are slightly underestimated.
These results suggest that D and P evaluated in this work may be slightly lower that their true values.

In caged models (Models IIIAn and IIIBn), a remarkable increase in energy content is achieved.
That is why much more attentions have been focused upon applications
of caged molecules in recent years. All of the compounds in Models
IIIAn and IIIBn possess higher (or
comparable) D (9.322–9.936 km/s) and P (40.329–47.548 GPa) than CL-20 (9.40 km/s, 42.00
GPa1). The better performance of Model
IIIBn than Model IIIAn can be attributed
to the additional O atoms. The additional O atoms make ρ and POB increase. Besides, it needs to mention that
IIIA2 and CL-20 have the same chemical formula (C6H6O12N12).

Observing the values
of ΔV, h50, and
ρQmax, it can
be found that ΔV, h50, and ρQmax values do not obtain
absolutely consistent results. However, it can be concluded that the
overall trend of sensitivity decreases with the increasing number
of n and the caged molecules have higher impact sensitivities
than the linear and cyclic compounds, as stated in ref (36): “generally, sensitivity
increases as ΔV and ρQmax become more larger and h50 becomes more smaller, but there are not correlations but rather
overall trends”. The high impact sensitivity (h50 = 5–15 cm) makes caged compounds hard to synthesize
and utilize. However, the predicted h50s of IIIA1 (13 cm), IIIA2 (13 cm), IIIB1 (15 cm), and IIIB3 (15 cm)
are slightly higher than that of CL-20 (12 cm41), which means IIIA1, IIIA2, IIIB1, and IIIB3 have relatively lower
sensitivity than CL-20. Thermal stability is another important parameter
to evaluate the performance of energetic materials. Thus, thermal
stabilities of IIIA1, IIIA2, IIIB1, and IIIB3 were examined by consideration
of three possible decomposition reactions, that is, homolysis of N–NO2; breakage of C–C or C–O between two layers;
and rupture of C–N in one layer. The required energies are
marked as EBD(N–NO2), EBD(C–C), EBD(C–O), and EBD(C–N), respectively
(Table 3). Generally,
the bond that requires the minimum energy to break is the weakest
and is most likely to be the trigger bond. Obviously, the pyrolysis
of IIIA1 is from the breakage of C–N bond. The small energy
barrier (18.42 kJ/mol) can be attributed to its considerable tension
of the molecular skeleton, which means IIIA1 is extremely thermally
instable. The pyrolysis of IIIA2, IIIB1, and IIIB3 are all initiated
from the rupture of N–NO2 bond. Comparing with the EBD(N–NO2) of CL-20 (141.16
kJ/mol), it can be found that the N–NO2 bonds in
IIIA2 and IIIB2 have higher strengths, which suggests that IIIA2 and
IIIB2 have higher thermal stability than CL-20. On the overall consideration
of the energetic properties, sensitivity, and thermal stability, it
can be concluded that IIIA2 (Figure 3) possesses better performance than CL-20. IIIA2 and
CL-20 have the same chemical formula (C6H6O12N12), whereas the good skeleton and better performance
make IIIA2 meaningful and valuable to find proper experimental method
to synthesize it.

4 Conclusions
A series of nitramines,
including linear, cyclic, and caged molecules,
were constructed and investigated using the DFT method at the B3LYP/6-31G*
and B3PW91/6-31G** levels. It gives a preliminary comparison on the
energetic properties of different kinds of nitramines. More results
will be reported in due course. The conclusions are as follows:(1) To improve
the performance of explosives,
the improvement of ρ is crucial. One way to improve the density
is by changing the molecular geometries from linear to cyclic to caged
structures.

(2) The trends
of ρ, D, and P in linear nitramines
suggest that infinite
extension of the chain length is not an advisable way to improve the
energetic properties of the energetic binders.

(3) POB and
ϕ both have big influences on the detonation properties. Generally,
the compounds with zero oxygen balance have better performance than
the ones with positive or negative oxygen balance.

(4) The order of ρ, D, and P (IIIBn > IIIAn > IIn > IAn >
IBn > ICn) suggests that the
caged nitramines are much
more appealing in seeking high-energy materials. IIIA2 possesses not
only comparable energetic properties but also better sensitivity and
thermal stability than CL-20.
