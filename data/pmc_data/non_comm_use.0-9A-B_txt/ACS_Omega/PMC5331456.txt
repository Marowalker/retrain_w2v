Gold
nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been electrochemically prepared
in situ and in vacuo using two different electrochemical device configurations,
containing an ionic liquid (IL), N-N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, that serves both as reaction and
as stabilizing media for the NPs. It was observed in both devices
that Au NPs were created using an anodically triggered route. The
created Au NPs are relatively small (3–7 nm) and reside within
the IL medium. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is utilized to follow
not only the formation of the NPs but also their charging/discharging
properties, by monitoring the charging shifts of the Au4f peak representing
the electrodes and also the Au NPs as well as the F1s peak of the
IL after polarizing one of the electrodes. Accordingly, DC polarization
across the electrodes leads to a uniform binding energy shift of F1s
of the IL along with that of Au4f of the NPs within. Moreover, this
shift corresponds to only half of the applied potential. AC polarization
brings out another dimension for demonstrating further the harmony
between the charging/discharging property of the IL medium and the
Au NPs in temporally and laterally resolved fashions. Polarization
of the electrodes result in perfect spectral separation of the Au4f
peaks of the NPs from those of the metal in both static (DC) and in
time- and position-dependent (AC) modes.

1 Introduction
It
is difficult, if not impossible, to incorporate conventional
electrochemical setups into high/ultrahigh vacuum chemical analysis
techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), owing to
the volatility or chemical instability of aqueous and organic electrolytes.
Ionic liquids (ILs) at room temperature overcome both of these shortcomings
because they have very low vapor pressures (∼10–12 mbar)1 and are stable against X-rays,
where significant beam damage and/or visible physical change(s) are
not observable under X-ray illumination within laboratory-based instruments.2 Moreover, ILs exhibit sufficient electrical conductivity
(∼10–2 cm–1),3 avoiding spectral artifacts such as peak shape
distortion and/or nonstoichiometry.4−7 Because XPS provides chemically resolved
information, changes in the electronic structure of the constituents,
such as the chemical states and/or their environment as a result of
chemical/electrochemical reactions/processes, can easily be revealed.
For example, the binding energy of the Au4f7/2 peak is
84.0 eV, corresponding to the neutral gold atoms within the metal
or small-sized particles, which are considered to be formally at zero
oxidation state (Au0). However, it is shifted by 1.1 and
3.2 eV to higher binding energies when gold is at +1 (Au1+) and +3 (Au3+) oxidation states, respectively, all of
which are easily resolved.8−11

Nanosized metal particles are utilized for
a wide range of applications
in science and technology because of their unique properties that
differ from those of their bulk.12 Syntheses
of highly dispersed and narrow-sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) within
aqueous and/or organic solvents usually require the usage of additional
surfactants, capping agents, and/or stabilizers during the preparation
processes.13 Among the other favorable
properties, ILs also appear to offer a suitable medium for metal NP
syntheses in terms of dispersity and stability of the particles.14,15 Numerous researchers have provided evidence about the important
role(s) of ILs in the preparation of metal NPs, as they have a high
charge density and self-organized structures in molecular scales.16−21 The current understanding of ILs facilitating spontaneous NP synthesis
relies on two factors: (i) ILs provide directional and continuous
ionic channels and (ii) ILs are entropic drivers. This subject and
the other stabilization properties of ILs have been reviewed by Dupont
and Scholten.22,23 Similarly, Scheeren and co-workers
reported the effective interaction between ILs and an organometallic
platinum surface that leads to a simple decomposition of the Pt precursor
into much smaller (around 2.3 nm) Pt NPs, and based on the XPS analyses,
they claimed that Pt NPs were stabilized through the formation of
chemical bonds with the IL.24,25

Metal NPs have
also been prepared using metal ions and chemical
reducers or by photon beam irradiation in IL media.26−29 Moreover, it was reported that
Au nano- and microstructures could be prepared and stabilized using
dissolved Au salt in an IL that was reduced without the need for additional
reducing and stabilizing agents but using only the IL for the reaction
medium.30 In another publication, it was
reported that Cu flakes were spontaneously dissociated into monodispersed
and ∼10 nm-sized Cu NPs, as a result of strong interaction
between the anion of the IL and the partially positively charged surface
of the metal.31 A recent review summarizes
the use of ILs as novel stabilizing agents for metal NP syntheses
as they combine the electrostatic stabilization because they are composed
of merely ions and steric stabilization through the restriction of
the free motion of the NPs by the ionic fragments.32 In addition to the simple decomposition of organometallic
precursors, NPs can also be obtained by energetic bombardment of the
bulk metal precursors, resulting in nanosized particles within ILs.
Laser-induced fragmentation of transition metal NPs in ILs was reported
for the control of shape and size.33 A
single-step synthesis of Au–Ag alloy NPs was reported using
a cosputter deposition technique, where it was also advocated that
this route was superior to the conventional solution-based ones, which
are dictated by the redox potential, hence not easy to control.34 Another study reported on the bombardment of
metal precursors by energetic Ar+ ions, resulting in the
physical ejection of small clusters from the bulk generating small
clusters, where the created nanosized Au particles were found to be
arranged as clusters on the surface of the particular IL.35

Another important use of ILs is as electrolytes
for electrochemical
deposition of mono- and/or bimetallic metal NPs where the electrochemical
reactions are driven by the applied potentials.36,37 Here, in addition to the ex situ characterization of the reaction
products, XPS offers an unequivocal opportunity for monitoring in
situ liquid phase reactions through the binding energy shifts as a
result of chemical state changes. The in situ reduction of the Pd2+ ions to Pd0 species in an IL was monitored by
following the changes in the Pd3d photoelectron signal intensities
corresponding to a decrease in the intensity of Pd2+ with
an accompanying increase in the Pd0 peaks, where the binding
energy positions of the two oxidations states were clearly resolved.1 In a different study, Taylor et al. reported
on monitoring the electrochemical reduction of Fe3+ species
to Fe2+ in a two-electrode electrochemical cell using an
externally connected potentiostat in real time, by following the changes
in the oxidation states of the corresponding photoelectron peaks together
with cyclic voltammograms recorded inside of the vacuum chamber.38 In their following work, dissolution of copper
metal and the electrochemical formation of cationic Cu+ species were identified by XPS in a time-dependent fashion, again
by following the intensity changes of the peaks in the Cu2p region.39 Similarly, Compton and co-workers had studied
the real-time electrodeposition of potassium metal in an electrochemical
cell containing potassium salt dissolved in an IL connected to the
potentiostat, while recording the K2s peak with respect to time.40 Later on, they reported the electrodeposition
of another group 1A metal, rubidium, that cannot be electrodeposited
from aqueous or organic solvents because of their narrower electrochemical
potential windows, while monitoring not only the increase in the intensity
of Rb3d with time but also the IL decomposition as a function of the
applied current.41

In a recent review,
Janiak has compiled the various synthesis methods
for metal NP preparation in ILs, most of which involves reduction
of metal salts, decomposition of zero-valent precursors, or sputter-deposition
from metal targets.42 In that review, and
in the studies mentioned above, NP formation triggered by an oxidation
route has not been mentioned at all, which is electrochemically more
common.43−45

We have recently reported on an XPS study monitoring
the potential
screening across two gold electrodes fabricated on a porous polymer
surface which was impregnated with the IL N-N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DEME-TFSI).46 In that work, we have also stated that a prolonged application
of +3 V bias leads to the formation of Au NPs in the vicinity of the
polarized electrode (i.e., oxidation-mediated electrocorrosion) but
within the IL medium and also mentioned that the details would be
the subject of future work. The present work is the follow-up of that
statement, where we will now raise and try to answer three important
questions: (i) Is the reaction predominantly electrochemically driven;
if so, anodically or cathodically triggered? (ii) Are the Au NPs neutral
or charged? (iii) And where do the NPs reside: within the IL medium
or deposited on the metal electrodes? The two Au electrodes used in
a coplanar capacitor geometry also seem to offer a convenient platform
for elucidating the mechanism(s) of this electrocorrosion process,
because of the symmetric nature of the electrodes in terms of their
chemical nature and size. In trying to answer these questions, we
will frequently bring up our findings from our previous work, where
the electrode and/or the IL medium charging, upon imposing external
potential bias, was monitored in a static and a dynamic fashion via
the experimentally determined potential-dependent XPS binding energy
shifts of the corresponding core levels, mainly the F1s (at 688.5
eV) and Au4f7/2 (at 84.0 eV) peaks representing the IL
and the gold electrodes, respectively. An additional simple galvanic
electrochemical preparation route was also introduced to facilitate
the Au NP production, also ensuring the removal of them from the device
and use for additional optical and microscopic characterization.

2 Results
In the first stage, we have used the same experimental
arrangement
as in our previous work, where two Au electrodes were fabricated,
in the source–drain geometry, on a porous polyethylene membrane
(PEM) containing the impregnated IL as the medium, providing electrical
conductivity.
The experimental details are reproduced in Figure S1 together with the chemical composition confirmation of the
atomic constituents of the IL medium (Figures S2 and S3). However, this time we have carried out XPS measurements
in much longer time scales of up to several days. Additionally, in
parallel investigations, we have checked the stability of both the
IL and the fabricated gold electrodes in vacuum and under X-ray exposure
in the above-mentioned time scales but without imposing any potential
across the electrodes. As a result, we can confidently say that no
significant corrosion was observed. Hence, at the outset, we can state
that the Au NP formation is triggered electrochemically within our
experimental arrangement. However, we should also mention that occasionally,
we have observed the formation of wine-colored features near the metal
electrodes, which we attribute to the Au NPs after a very long (>3
days) exposure of the device to air, triggered most probably by ambient
photochemical means.

2.1 Monitoring Electrocorrosion
We imposed
a +3 V DC stress while recording consecutive XP spectra in the line
scan mode as snapshots of the Au4f region, with 100 μm X-ray
spot- and 100 μm step-sizes between each data point, starting
from the source electrode to the drain, as shown in Figure 1. The imposed voltage caused
a current flow between the electrodes, which was high at the beginning
but reached a steady-state value of ∼14 nA as measured by the
source meter (see also Figure S4 for variation
in the current with time), which also caused corrosion at the anodically
polarized Au electrode. This device geometry is also suitable for
real-time reaction monitoring at the electrodes. The corrosion was
noticeable by the physical changes in the electrode accompanied by
the formation of secondary Au species at the electrode/IL interfacial
region only in the polarized electrode, by examining the Au4f spectra
recorded in the line scan mode across the entire device repetitively
as the device was subjected to external biasing up to 14 h continuously. Figure 1 also depicts four
line spectra of the Au4f region under the +3 V bias, where the x-axes correspond to the binding energy in eV and the y-axes correspond to the distance in millimeters from the
polarized electrode toward the grounded one, recorded at the beginning,
after 3.5, 6, and 14 h. The color bar indicates the variations in
the normalized intensity of the corresponding Au4f or F1s peaks.

Figure 1 (a) Schematics
of the device. XP spectra of the Au4f region, recorded
in the line scan mode from the source toward the drain electrodes;
(b) at the beginning of the experiment (t = 0), (c)
after 3.5 h (t = 3.5 h), (d) 6 h (t = 6 h) and (e) 14 h (t = 14 h) during the continuous
application of +3 V DC external potential. The color bar represents
the peak intensities. The schematic illustration represents the line
scan direction and the source–drain geometry including the
electrical connections. The normalized Au4f spectra from the two points
on the line at different positions are given (f) at 500 μm and
(g) at 6000 μm away from the polarized electrode.

The Au4f spin–orbit doublet appeared at
84.0 and 87.7 eV
at the grounded electrode but shifted to 87.0 and 90.7 eV at the polarized
one. The intense Au4f peak at the source electrode at the beginning
of the experiment decreased throughout the measurement, as shown in Figure 1f, whereas it was
virtually the same at the drain side, all throughout (Figure 1g). In parallel, a second type
of Au species started ascending from the source side with low intensity,
which will be discussed in more detail later. However, neither a different
ionic species nor a measurable electrode corrosion was detected by
XPS at the grounded electrode. The corrosion at the source side under
a +3 V DC potential was emphasized by comparing the intensity of the
Au4f peaks recorded at a particular position d =
0.5 mm corresponding to the fifth point on the entire line scan starting
from the polarized electrode, at the beginning of the measurement
and after 14 h. The spectra that were also normalized in intensity
and shown in Figure 1f confirmed the corrosion of the polarized electrode by the significant
decrease (∼70%) in the intensity of Au4f photoelectron peaks
after 14 h by applying the +3 V DC. In contrast, the normalized spectra,
recorded at the position d = 6.0 mm near the drain
side of the device (Figure 1g), displayed almost no change as an indication of the absence
of electrode corrosion and/or secondary species formation.

The
potential was switched from +3 to −3 V DC after a certain
number of line scans were recorded to probe “whether there
is also an electrochemical reaction taking place at the grounded electrode
upon reversal of the polarization”. Measurements were taken
using exactly the same experimental conditions except for the reversal
of the polarization for 15 h continuously, as depicted in Figure 2. Under the −3
V polarization, the Au4f spin–orbit doublet appeared still
at 84.0 and 87.7 eV at the grounded electrode but then was shifted
to 81.0 and 90.7 eV at the negatively polarized electrode. The spectra
shown in Figure 2a–d
for both the source and the drain sides display no apparent change
in intensity. As highlighted in Figure 2e, the normalized Au4f spectra, recorded again at the
beginning of the −3 V DC potential application and also after
15 h at the position d = 6.0 mm, confirmed that there
was neither electrocorrosion nor secondary Au species formation at
the drain-side of the device. Therefore, we can now state that the
electrocorrosion is definitely anodically triggered.

region, recorded in the line scan mode
from the source toward the drain electrodes; (a) at the beginning
of the experiment (t = 0), after (b) 3.5 h (t = 3.5 h), (c) 6 h (t = 6 h), and (d)
15 h (t = 15 h) during the continuous application
of −3 V DC external potential. (e) Normalized Au4f spectra
at 6000 μm away from the polarized electrode at the beginning
(black graph) and end (red graph) of the experiment.

To elaborate on the new Au species formed, we zoomed
in on the
interface and recorded data using an X-ray spot size of 50 μm
and recorded line scan Au4f spectra with 50 μm step sizes for
about 1 mm while imposing +3, 0, and −3 V DC bias, as depicted
in Figure 3a. Although
the secondary Au species appear as a tail of the electrode, and their
spectral positions cannot be separated from those of the metallic
Au4f ones when the device is grounded, they get completely separated
under both positive and negative biases. In Figure 3c, two Au4f spectra that represent two different
points on the line scan are shown. The red spectra correspond to the
metallic Au4f of the Au electrode at the 2nd position on the line,
and the green spectra correspond to the new Au species at the 11th
position on the line. Note also that the intensities of the Au4f peaks
of the new Au species, as shown both in Figure 3a,c, are significantly smaller. The spectral
separation is related to the charging property of the surrounding
medium of the new Au species, which, in actuality, is the IL medium
itself. Therefore, it is best to relate the peak positions to the
F1s peak of the IL, which are also shown in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 (a) Au4f and (b) F1s XP spectra in line scan
mode along 1 mm from
the source-electrode point recorded under the application of +3, 0
(grounded), and −3 V DC potentials. (c) Au4f XP spectra recorded
in a higher resolution (normal scan mode) at two different positions
indicated.

As pointed out in our previous
paper, as a result of the symmetric
voltage drop at the two Au–IL interfaces, the entire IL medium
retained only half of the applied potential, which was also uniform
within the IL medium. Hence, throughout the entire IL medium surface,
the F1s experienced approximately only +1.5 and −1.5 eV shifts
from the grounded position when +3.0 and −3.0 V bias were applied.
The measured binding energies are given in Table 1, and a schematic diagram of the potential
drop across the electrodes is given in the Figure S5. As can be gathered from Figure 3a and Table 1, this is more or less the shift exhibited by the new
Au species, and its uncharged binding energy can now be estimated
using the binding energy differences between the F1s and the Au4f7/2 peaks and working backwards to yield a value of (688.5
– 604.5) = 84.0 ± 0.1 eV, exactly the same value of the
neutral Au0, hinting that the new Au species are neutral
Au particles. This point will be corroborated with additional experimental
data in the following sections.

2.2 Role
of the Electrode Nature
To further
investigate the role of the nature of the electrode in NP formation,
a different geometry was adopted, where the ground electrode was now
replaced by a Pt electrode and a Au wire was used as the sacrificial
electrode, dipped into the IL drop, as shown in Figure 4. Application of −3 V continuously
for ∼60 h in the vacuum chamber of the spectrometer resulted
in no visible change within the IL, as shown in Figure 4a and schematically described in Figure 4c. In stark contrast,
application of +3 V for the same duration resulted in the formation
of the well-known wine-colored Au NPs, a picture of which is given
in Figure 4b and schematized
in Figure 4d. The visible
spectrum of the resultant IL solution is shown in Figure 4e. The strong surface plasmon
resonance peak of the Au NPs centered at 470 nm is consistent with
the previously reported data on Au NPs in ILs.47 A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, shown in Figure 4f, verified the formation
of Au NPs, having a nearly spherical shape and with a particle size
ranging between 3 and 7 nm. At higher magnifications, the lattice
fringes of the Au NPs were clearly observable, as shown in Figure S7, revealing the crystalline nature of
Au NPs. At this point, we can reiterate that anodically triggered
electrocorrosion produces oxidized Au species, most probably Au1+, which transfer into the IL medium, get reduced, and eventually
coalesce to form Au NPs.

Figure 4 Images of the device and the IL medium after
prolonged application
of (a) −3 and (b) +3 V, for 60 h to the Au wire. The processes
are schematized in (c) and (d). (e) Visible spectrum and (f) TEM image
of Au NPs in the IL created by +3 V polarization of the Au wire. Only
the anodically polarized Au wire leads to the formation of wine-colored
NPs.

It is also possible to estimate
the order of the magnitude of the
concentration of the electrochemically prepared Au NPs in this geometry
using the measured steady-state current reached under +3 V potential,
which was 30 nA on average for the duration of 60 h ([30 × 10–9 C/s × 60 h × 3600 s/h]/[96 485 C/mol
e–] = 70 × 10–9 mol e–)
and assuming that the oxidized Au species have +1 charge (i.e., Au1+), to yield ∼70 nmol Au1+, which somehow
get reduced within the IL and are converted to neutral Au atoms which
eventually coalesce to Au0 NPs. Hence, the concentration
of Au0 atoms within the ∼10 μL IL medium can
be approximated as ∼0.001 M (moles/L). This concentration can
also be related to the measured absorbance value of ∼1.0 in
the visible spectrum of the Au NPs, as shown in Figure 4e, using  where ∈ is the extinction coefficient,
reported to be on the order of 3–6 × 106/M·cm;48b is the thickness of the IL
film prepared for recording the visible spectrum, estimated to be
∼10 μm; and c is the concentration (∼1
mM) of the solution. These numbers yield an estimated absorbance of
1, consistent with the measured value.

2.3 Static
Response of the Au NPs and the IL Medium
To get detailed
XPS data on the electrochemically prepared Au NPs
in DEME-TFSI using this geometry, we transferred 5 μL of the
IL containing the electroformed Au NPs onto the PEM of the previously
described device with two coplanar Au electrodes, as schematically
described in Figure 5. The liquid wets the surface of the device and impregnates the membrane.
The device was then analyzed using XPS in the familiar source–drain
geometry. Detailed survey spectra recorded throughout the entire device
indicate (i) no sign of Pt4f peaks, (ii) stoichiometric IL, and (iii)
presence of ample Au4f peaks everywhere.

Figure 5 Schematic representation
of the device preparation in source–drain
geometry using the Au NPs generated between Au and Pt electrodes in
DEME-TFSI.

Here again, the strategy of polarizing
the electrodes is employed
to characterize and separate the Au NP peaks from those of the electrodes.
Therefore, XPS line scan data were collected using an X-ray spot size
of 50 μm and a step size of 50 μm in the scanning mode
for both Au4f and F1s regions, similar to the ones displayed in Figure 3. The line scans
are shown in Figure 6a,b for the Au4f and F1s regions, respectively, and represent a collection
of spectra that were scanned along the indicated 2 mm line, starting
from the electrified electrode toward the middle of the IL device,
and the color bar represents the intensities of the photoelectron
peaks. As already shown in Figure 3, the Au4f spectra cannot be separated/differentiated
when grounded but can be completely separated upon application of
+3 and −3 V biases, whereas no separation in terms of secondary
species formation or splitting of the peaks were observable for the
F1s region, only displaying a uniform ∼1.5 eV shift, which
is again only half of the applied potential to the electrode. Therefore,
we assigned one of the Au4f spin–orbit doublets to the polarized
gold electrode and the other to the wine-colored Au0 NPs
within the IL medium of the device. The harmony between Au0 and the IL medium is attained because the binding energy shifts
of the corresponding Au4f and F1s peaks are similar to the applied
potential (i.e., only half of it), displaying a different behavior
when compared with the static (DC) response of the Au electrode.

Figure 6 XP spectra
of (a) Au4f and (b) F1s regions, recorded in the line
scan mode from the source electrode toward the middle of the device
under +3, 0 (grounded), and −3 V DC bias.

2.4 Dynamic Response of the Au NPs and the IL
Medium
In our previous work, we also demonstrated that the
time-dependent charging behavior of the F1s photoelectron peak of
the DEME-TFSI IL was found to be different at different lateral positions,
which is also reproduced in Figure S8.46 Therefore, one can speculate that the Au NPs
dispersed in IL should also have a similar behavior. To test this
hypothesis, we recorded time-dependent XP spectra with 1 s time resolution,
while imposing slowly varying 10 mHz square-wave pulses (SQW) with
3 V amplitude at four different lateral positions along the device,
as depicted in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Time-resolved (1 s) XP spectra of the Au4f and F1s regions under
10 mHz 3 V SQW excitation recorded at four different lateral positions.
Each graph displays a total of 200 spectra, recorded in 200 s.

The first and fourth points indicated
by the red line are on the
biased and grounded electrodes, respectively, whereas the second and
third points are near the IL/electrode interfaces. DEME-TFSI drop
spreads over the entire device including the Au electrodes; hence,
the F1s peak is detectable on both Au electrodes and in the IL medium
containing the NPs. Under the external 10 mHz SQW pulses, the Au4f
peaks of the metal do not show any time-dependent changes in both
electrodes, except for the uniform +3.0 eV shift to the higher binding
energy from the grounded position during the positive cycle and −3.0
eV shift in the negative one for the source side and absolutely no
shift in the drain side because it is always grounded. By contrast,
the position of the F1s peak exhibits strong time dependency at all
four points, which are laterally varying also. As discussed in our
previous work, their polarization directions are completely opposite
to each other on the polarized and the grounded electrodes. Of paramount
interest is the fact that the Au4f spectra of the Au NPs are also
harmonized with the F1s of the IL medium, which also proves our hypothesis.

3 Discussion
There have been reports of electrochemical
gold etching in aqueous
medium and under applied potential. Most of these reports detail applied
potential waveforms on gold electrodes in acidic solutions.45,47−49 These waveforms involve potentials that are anodic
enough to form a layer of gold oxide and potentials that are cathodic
enough to reduce this layer. The stresses created on the gold electrode
that form upon the creation and breakdown of the gold oxide film lead
to NPs of gold to detach from the electrode. In some reports involving
electrochemical gold etching, the etching is done under applied anodic
potentials.50 When the etching is only
anodic, it is generally assumed that the dissolution goes through
a simple oxidation of metallic gold into cations (Au+ or
Au3+) that are then complexed with the Cl– or CN– ions in the solution. However, because
the thrust of these studies was not the details of the etching process,
further analyses were not reported. Our findings suggest that in our
system of gold electrode in DEME-TFSI, the electrochemically oxidized
gold species on the surface of the electrode creates enough strain
on the gold surface that leads to dislodging from the electrode surface.
These species eventually get reduced and lead to Au NP formation,
stabilized in the IL medium, which is consistent with the numerous
experimental and theoretical studies reported.51,52 Further experimental and theoretical work is needed to elucidate
the mechanism(s) and the role(s) of each and every species and/or
medium involved.

4 Experimental Section
PEM (20 μm thickness) (Celgard 2730, Gelon LIB Group) with
a porosity of 43% was used for the device fabrication. Electrochemistry-grade
IL (≥98.5%) DEME-TFSI was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (CAS
number: 464927-84-2). In the first electrochemical device, the two
Au electrodes were sputtered from a Au target onto the two sides of
the 20 μm-thick porous PEM in a low vacuum environment around
0.15 mbar and 25 mA discharge current for 80 s using a conventional
plasma sputter-coating. DEME-TFSI or the DEME-TFSI containing Au NPs
was injected onto the surface of the PEM in 5μL portions in
between the Au electrodes, which spreads rapidly on the membrane and
wets even the electrodes. One of the Au electrodes of the IL device
in the two-electrode geometry was connected to the external electrical
source meter (source), whereas the other Au electrode was grounded
(drain). For the alternative galvanic preparation of Au NPs using
a different route, 10 μL of DEME-TFSI was inserted as a liquid
drop between a Pt substrate and a Au wire. In this galvanic cell,
the Pt electrode was grounded (drain), whereas the Au electrode (source)
was connected to the external electrical source(s).

A Thermo
Fisher Kα X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with
a monochromatized photon energy of 1486.6 eV was used for all XPS
measurements. To minimize moisture absorption by the IL, the device,
together with the IL, was quickly inserted to the load-lock of the
instrument, pumped in the entry chamber until the pressure around
10–8 mbar was reached, and subsequently transferred
to the analysis chamber. XPS data were collected and analyzed using
the Avantage software version 5.31, provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific.

After the galvanic preparation and pictures of the cell were taken,
5 μL of Au NP/IL was placed between 22 × 22 mm2 microscope slide cover glasses and the UV–visible spectrum
was recorded on a Cary 300 UV–vis spectrometer (Agilent Technologies)
in the wavelength region of 350–800 nm by scanning with data
intervals of 0.167 nm and a scan rate of 100 nm/min. For TEM analysis,
AuNPs dispersed in the DEME-TFSI medium were dropped onto a carbon-mesh-supported
copper grid. A Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope at 300
kV beam energy was used to obtain high-angle annular dark-field scanning
and bright-field images.

5 Conclusions
In summary,
we have satisfactorily answered the three questions
raised in the Introduction section. In addition,
based on what we have probed so far for the in situ preparation of
Au NPs in vacuo, our results show thati. XPS can definitely bring a chemically
resolved perspective for in situ electrochemical reaction monitoring

ii. Au NPs are synthesized
by electrochemical
oxidation, possibly first by the generation of Au+ ions,
which are reduced to Au0 and coalesce within the DEME-TFSI
medium and

iii. The charging/discharging
properties
of the Au metal is different from those of the Au NPs dispersed in
the IL medium, leading to completely different responses to electrical
excitations, hence offering perfect analytical and spectral separation.



We anticipate that our unique experimental
approach together with
the simple devices introduced and with the new findings presented
will pave way for a better understanding of some of the electrochemical
concepts, and naturally call for further experimental and theoretical
work.
