In this study, we have fabricated
nanofuses from thin-film, arc-deposited
carbon for use in permanent data storage. Thin-film carbon fuses have
fewer fabrication barriers and retain the required resistivity and
structural stability to act as a data-storage medium. Carbon thin
films were characterized for their electrical, microstructural, and
chemical bonding properties. Annealing these films in an argon environment
at 400 °C reduced the resistivity from about 4 × 10–2 Ω cm as deposited to about 5 × 10–4 Ω cm, allowing a lower blowing voltage. Nanofuses
with widths ranging from 200 to 60 nm were fabricated and tested.
They blow with voltages between 2 and 5.5 V, and the nanofuses remain
stable in both “1” and “0” states under
a constantly applied read voltage of 1 V for over 90 h.

Introduction
In just over 60 years, from 1951 to 2013,
the amount of data that
can be stored digitally on a single data-storage device has increased
from 224 kB to 88 TB.1 Unfortunately, to
achieve these high data densities, the mean lifetime of the stored
data has been sacrificed. As a result, digital data-storage devices,
such as digital video disks (DVDs), hard drives, and flash memory,
have a mean lifetime of less than 10 years.2−5 Possible failure mechanisms of
these devices can include atomic diffusion, electromigration, oxidation,
and other chemical changes (Figure 1). To reliably maintain data for more than 10 years,
multiple copies are made and the data are periodically migrated.6 However, these solutions are time consuming,
involve additional expenses, require complex systems for large data
volumes, and can still result in data loss.7−10 Permanent data-storage media
require long-term stability of both “1” and “0”
states of the data. For example, a comparison of conventional and
permanent data-storage media for optical and solid-state devices is
illustrated in Figure 1. Writable compact disks and DVDs contain organic dyes with limited
long-term stability. The M-disc, used for permanent data storage,
by contrast, uses structural changes in an inorganic layer to store
the data (Figure 1D).
This results in data stability of more than 1000 years.8,11

to permanent, relating materials that have been used for data storage
and their permanence. (A) Optical disks can undergo chemical changes,
resulting in a change of optical properties. (B) In integrated circuits,
tunneling and electromigration can cause data instability. (C) Metal
fuses suffer from thermal movement of atoms, resulting in the formation
of dendrites. (D) M-disk is the structurally based permanent data-storage
device that is currently available. (E) Carbon nanofuses use a structural
mechanism to store the data; however, unlike metal fuses, the carbon
is stable due to its high local bond strength.

Solid-state flash memory has become widely used for a variety
of
reasons, including its convenient form factor, low power requirement,
lack of moving parts, and much higher read/write speeds than optical
and magnetic disks. Flash-based solid-state data-storage works by
storing charge on a floating gate in a transistor. To write a data
bit in flash memory, charge is injected onto the floating gate through
a thin insulating layer. However, over a time scale of years, a significant
amount of the charge that is stored on the floating gate will tunnel
out through the insulator,12,13 resulting in data instability
and loss (Figure 1).
For the development of permanent solid-state data storage, there is
a need to transition from charge-based and reversible phase change
media to irreversible, structurally based storage mechanisms. These
mechanisms could include irreversible phase changes, stable chemical
bonding changes, or material displacement. Structurally based data
storage using microscale metal fuses was prevalent from the 1970s
to the 1980s. These metal fuses (Figure 1) were the basis for programmable read-only
memory. An intact fuse allows current to flow, whereas a blown fuse
does not allow it, corresponding to data bits of 1 and 0, respectively.
At the blowing voltage, the metal in the fuse melts and is displaced,
opening up an insulating structural gap. Even though metal fuses use
a structural change to store data, the high surface mobility of the
metal allows atoms to migrate when a voltage is applied over time.14 This caused fuses to exhibit dendritic growth
in the blown state, forming conductive paths across the fuse gap and
resulting in data corruption.

In contrast to metals, conductive
graphitic carbon has high structural
stability because of its much higher localized bond strength. Graphene
is an atomically thin sheet of graphitic carbon, which does not readily
oxidize below 300 °C and has thermal and electrical resistivities
that could allow fuses to write in the single-volts range. Graphene
has recently been used15 to create carbon
fuses, where a write voltage permanently oxidized the fuse, resulting
in a stable structural gap. Consistent with carbon’s high local
bonding strength, these graphene fuses do not demonstrate dendritic
growth. These graphene fuses were fabricated from chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)-grown graphene films. CVD-grown graphene layers are polycrystalline,
containing grain boundary and other defects and requiring transfer
to an insulating substrate. The grain boundaries, defects, and transfer-induced
damage of the delicate graphene sheets result in significant barriers
to manufacturing.16,17 In short, fabrication of high-performance
electronic devices with graphene is an active area of research, but
there is currently no industrial electronic device manufacturing from
graphene due to the significant quality and cost barriers. Conversely,
physical vapor deposition (PVD) of carbon is widely used industrially
and consequently can be much more readily integrated into current
electronic manufacturing.

Thin-film carbon can be deposited
by widely used PVD processes,18,19 including sputtering,
electron-beam deposition, and arc deposition.
Sputtered carbon thin films have resistivities of approximately 104 Ω cm,20−22 whereas arc-deposited and e-beam-evaporated carbon
thin films have significantly lower as-deposited resistivities, in
the range of 10–2 Ω cm,18,23,24 which can be further lowered by annealing.
Using the relationship between temperature, thermal conductivity,
and electrical conductivity, as described by Pearson,25 a carbon nanofuse will reach the required temperature to
be programmed15 at 3 V if the resistivity
is less than 10–2 Ω cm. This means that either
arc-deposited or e-beam-evaporated carbon would work for this purpose.

Here, we fabricated nanofuses with arc-deposited carbon, as illustrated
in Figure 2. When a
programming voltage is applied to the fuse, the thin neck of carbon
is heated and oxidized. The oxidation process results in a nonconductive
gap (a blown fuse). Blown and unblown fuses represent data bits of
0 and 1, respectively. For this study, over 100 carbon nanofuses were
fabricated and tested with carbon thickness, length, and width of
20, 250, and 60–200 nm, respectively.

pattern electrically connected to the gold contact pads.

The PVD-grown carbon represents a significant materials
and processing
departure from graphene. In contrast to the crystalline monolayer
graphene used previously, this PVD-grown carbon is amorphous and 100
times thicker, resulting in significantly different electrical and
thermal characteristics. An important question is whether the time
required to blow a fuse with this thicker material will be prohibitive;
consequently, we measured the data write time and power requirements.
The thin-film carbon nanofuses were irreversibly written, with low
power requirement between 0.5 and 3.5 mW, and writing speeds of less
than 200 ns.

We also studied the voltage and current requirements
for fuses
with lateral dimensions down to five time smaller than the previous
graphene nanofuses. These studies provide data that will be valuable
in determining the feasibility of obtaining permanent memory from
PVD-grown amorphous carbon and the productive fuse geometries.

Decreasing the width of carbon nanofuses also decreases the voltage
and power required to blow them. This allows production of fuses that
will blow at less than 3 V, which is similar to that of the current
flash memory. Just as importantly, when a thin-film carbon nanofuse
is blown, dendritic growth is not observed. The stability of these
fuses was excellent; no degradation was seen in either the blown or
unblown states when tested for a time equivalent to 1012 reads.

Experimental Section
Thin-Film Carbon Nanofuse Fabrication
The nanofuse
fabrication process is outlined in Figure 2. The nanofuses were fabricated on a silicon
substrate with a 250 nm thick thermal oxide to provide electrical
isolation. Gold pads were first made by spinning 950 k PMMA (6 wt
%) in anisole (MicroChem) on the substrate at 3000 rpm, which was
then placed on a hot plate at 220 °C for 90 s. The PMMA was then
exposed with a line dose of 120 μC/cm2 using 30 keV
electrons from an FEI XL30 ESEM equipped with a high-speed beam blanker.
The samples were developed using a methyl isobutyl ketone–isopropanol
(MIBK/IPA) 1:3 mixture (MicroChem) for 60 s and then spray-rinsed
with acetone for 2 s, followed by a 10 s IPA rinsing. Next, an 80
nm gold layer was thermally deposited at 5 × 10–6 Torr, with an evaporation rate of 0.5 Å/s, using 6 nm of chrome
as the adhesion layer. The remaining PMMA and gold were then removed
with a liftoff process in an acetone bath for 30 min.

The carbon
fuses were then made by first spinning a positive electron-beam resist,
950 k PMMA (MicroChem), diluted to 3 wt % in anisole and spun on at
3000 rpm. The sample was then heat-treated on a hot plate at 185 °C
for 60 s. A bow-tie geometry was exposed into the electron-beam resist
by exposing the patterned area with a line dose of 230–250
μC/cm2 using 30 keV electrons. The sample was developed
in a MIBK/IPA 1:3 (MicroChem) solution for 60 s and then spray-rinsed
with IPA for 10 s. A 20 nm thin-film carbon layer was next deposited
by carbon arc deposition at 5 × 10–6 Torr,
with an evaporation rate of 3 Å/s. The carbon rods were sharpened
to a cylindrical point, with length and inner width of 5.5 and 1.25
mm, respectively. The sample was finally placed in an acetone bath
for 30 min to lift off the excess carbon and rinsed with IPA for 10
s. This resulted in a bow-tie-patterned carbon nanofuse that is electrically
connected between two gold contact pads. The bow-tie geometry of the
fuse with a narrow neck was chosen because it focuses the current
to a small region, allowing the temperature increase to be localized
to the center of the fuse. The samples were then annealed in a 1 in.
quartz tube heated to 400 °C in an argon environment to decrease
the resistivity of the carbon.

Results and Discussion
Thin-Film
Carbon Characterization
To characterize the
thin-film carbon, its surface roughness, sheet resistance, microstructure,
and the carbon sp2/sp3 ratio were determined.
The roughness was measured on a 10 nm layer of carbon (as measured
by a calibrated Xtal monitor) deposited on an oxidized, polished silicon
wafer. The step height and roughness of the carbon film were measured
on a Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode. Figure 3A,B shows that the
AFM step height of 10 nm matched the target thickness and that the
measured roughness of the thin carbon film was 0.53 nm. The sheet
resistivity was measured on a 20 nm thick carbon film deposited on
a 250 nm thick thermal oxide on a silicon wafer. Four-point probe
measurements yielded a resistivity of 0.041 ± 0.007 Ω cm.
Previous studies on arc-deposited carbon have shown that resistivity
is reduced by thermal annealing.19 The
impact of annealing in an inert environment at lower temperatures
was explored. Specifically, the carbon films were annealed in an argon
environment at 400 °C for various times. The effect of annealing
time on resistivity is shown in Figure 3C. Annealing the as-deposited carbon layer at 400 °C
for 10 min in argon reduced the resistivity by approximately 2 orders
of magnitude.

carbon. (D) Diffraction pattern before (left) and after (right) annealing.
(E) Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) data for annealed and

To determine carbon microstructure
and bonding, a 10 nm layer of
carbon was deposited onto a flat salt crystal. The carbon film was
delaminated from the salt crystal by placing it briefly in a water
bath and rinsing for 1 h in water. The film was split and placed onto
two 300 mesh titanium transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids
and air-dried. One of the carbon samples was annealed for 10 min in
an argon environment. To characterize the microstructure, composition,
and chemical bonding of the carbon, a Tecnai F20 TEM was used to obtain
diffraction patterns, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data,
and EELS data. The diffraction pattern showed that the thin-film carbon
is amorphous (Figure 3D). The EDX data indicated that the film was composed of carbon with
a small amount of silica, which we attribute to the silicone pump
oil in the carbon deposition system. On analyzing the EELS results
(Figure 3E), a strong
sp2 peak is visible. We compared the arc-deposited thin
film of carbon with sp2 standards (lacey carbon film and
ultrathin carbon black, Ted Pella product #01824).

Nanofuse Characterization
Figure 4 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM)
images of 73 carbon nanofuses with varying sizes as well as their
current–voltage (I–V) plots. In the SEM images, the dark bow-tie-shaped region is the
carbon fuse. The widths of the middle regions of the fuses vary from
200 to 60 nm. Above and below the fuse, the electrically insulating
SiO2 layer (the lighter region) is visible. Bumps like
those on the carbon in Figure 4A were seen on a few devices, which we attribute to residue
obtained from the liftoff process. I–V measurements were used to determine the voltage and current
required to write to a fuse. For this measurement, a voltage starting
at 0 V and increasing at a rate of 0.5 V/s was applied to an intact
fuse until the current abruptly dropped to zero, indicating that the
fuse had oxidized and was blown. The voltage at which the current
dropped to zero is the writing voltage, and the slope of the I–V curve shows the resistance of
the fuses. For the 200, 150, 100, and 60 nm fuses, the measured writing
voltages were 5.1 ± 0.3, 3.3 ± 0.3, 3.0 ± 0.1, and
1.8 ± 0.6 V, respectively. These voltages give a window, where
any voltage below would not change the nanofuse, whereas any voltage
above would result in a blown fuse.

little spheres on the nanofuse in (A) is residual electron-beam resist.
It did not affect the testing of the nanofuses. The nanofuses were
subjected to increasing voltage until they blew. (E–H) I–V curves of the corresponding
thin-film carbon nanofuses. The red boxes illustrate the voltage ranges
over which the fuses blow. A voltage below this range did not blow
any fuses, whereas a voltage above this range was sufficient to blow
all fuses of the noted width.

To measure the time required to write to a carbon nanofuse,
a square
voltage pulse that was 50% higher than the writing voltage was applied
using a Hewlett-Packard 214B pulse generator (refer to Figure 5F for a schematic of the setup).
The voltage across a 1 kΩ resistor in series with the carbon
nanofuse was used to measure the current passing through the fuse.
When the current dropped to zero, the fuse was considered to be blown.
To ensure that the nanofuse was blown, a voltage was applied across
the nanofuse and no current was measured. The current decay seen in Figure 5F indicates a write
time of less than 200 ns.

before they broke, the power it takes to blow the fuses was found.

carbon nanofuse, and an oscilloscope measures the voltage over a 1
kΩ resistor to get the current and shape of the pulse. (F) Current
passing through the 1 kΩ resistor during the pulse, resulting
in fuse blow within 300 ns.

The electrical read stability of carbon nanofuses was tested
by
applying a constant read voltage of 1 V (well below the writing voltage)
over an intact fuse and monitoring the current over time. To accelerate
the testing of blown carbon and metal fuses, a voltage of 10 V (well
above the writing voltage) was applied. Figure 6 shows the electrical read stability of carbon
nanofuses and the electrical instability of metal nanofuses due to
structural degradation. With a bit read time on the order of 100 ns,
the 90 h test is equivalent to having a field present for greater
than 1012 reads.

Discussion
Significant variation in the writing voltage
is unacceptable for
a data-storage medium. This voltage variation can come from film roughness,
manufacturing imprecision, and grain boundaries. A low roughness of
the carbon film allows the fuses to have a repeatable blowing voltage,
with a thickness of 20 nm. Because the carbon is amorphous (Figure 3D), there are no
grain boundaries that would cause resistivity variations between fuses,
which would in turn cause a variation of the blowing voltage.

The high degrees of reproducibility of the I–V measurement for 200, 150, and 100 nm indicate that slight
process variations do not have a significant impact on device performance
(Figure 4). At 60 nm,
however, we see greater device-to-device variation in the I–V curves, likely resulting from
the larger impact of our lithography limitations and line-edge roughness
on these smaller devices.

For the nanofuses to be used in data
storage, the read and write
voltages should work with standard computer drivers. This means that
the write voltage should be below 3 V and the read voltage should
be around 1 V. As the nanofuse width gets smaller, the voltage and
current required to blow them also decrease (Figure 5). This trend allows for carbon nanofuses
to have the blowing voltage tuned to above 1 V and below 3 V. To analyze
any chemical bonding change in the carbon film due to annealing, we
compared the normalized intensity ratio of the carbon k edge from
the annealed and unannealed samples with sp2 carbon standards
(lacey carbon film and ultrathin carbon black, Ted Pella product #01824).
These EELS results indicate that the thin-film carbon is composed
of amorphous sp2 carbon both before and after annealing.
In short, despite the large change in resistivity due to annealing,
no change in the structure, composition, or bonding of the thin-film
carbon was observed.

The life expectancy (LE) of permanent data-storage
media depends
on the failure mechanisms present when data are being read, called
read disturb (RD) errors, and when they are being stored, called data
retention (DR) errors. Failure mechanisms in nanofuse-based data storage
could include atomic diffusion, electromigration, oxidation, and other
chemical changes. Key to having a long time scale for these degradation
mechanisms is the fundamental stability of the chemical bonds of the
materials that comprise the data-storage medium. The sp2 carbon has a very high local bond strength, which should provide
a significant stability advantage, leading to longer LEs. The chemical
path most likely to result in the degradation of surface carbon is
oxidation, but carbon does not readily oxidize below 300 °C and
so would remain very stable at or near room temperature. In fact,
we have seen no degradation in written or unwritten carbon nanofuses
upon storage at room temperature over the several months this study
was carried out.

Despite the high expected stability of carbon
bonds in the bulk
of these materials, we were particularly concerned about the stability
of the surface carbon atoms and their stability under the RD conditions
of data readout. Stability problems for metal fuses have been seen
to primarily arise from the formation of dendrites in fuse gaps under
applied electric fields (Figure 6E,F), resulting in current pathways when the fuse is
broken, and data corruption. We therefore subjected carbon fuses to
an accelerated testing of RD conditions and presented the results
in Figure 6C,D. For
both the intact and blown states of the nanofuse, the test voltage
was applied for a time equivalent to the cumulative time that voltage
would be applied during 1012 reads without detecting any
change in the nanofuses.

DR measurements on these fuses during
storage are also important
but will need to be carried out on far more devices than the few devices
measured here. For such data to be relevant in the context of modern
memory systems, this will require scale up (ultimately to gigabyte
levels) of integrated devices so that relevant statistical analysis
can be done and compared to that of other archival solid-state storage
media.26

Conclusions
Nanofuses
for permanent data storage could be reliably produced
with arc-deposited carbon. The arc-deposited carbon thin film shows
predominantly sp2 character and is electrically conductive
and deposits uniformly. These carbon nanofuses are electrically stable
for read voltages held over 90 h. Their writing time is under 200
ns, and they blow with power in the low milliwatt range. We also found
the voltage and current requirements for fuses with lateral dimensions
down to five time smaller than in the previous graphene nanofuses.
Both the power and voltage required to blow a carbon nanofuse decrease
with fuse size, indicating that the writing voltage is tunable to
fuse geometry. These studies provide data that will be valuable in
determining the feasibility of manufacturing permanent memory from
PVD-grown amorphous carbon and the productive fuse geometries.
