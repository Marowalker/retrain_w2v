Solid base catalysts featuring green,
robustness, and high activity
play an important role in the current fine-chemical and petrochemical
industry. Normally, the generation of supported K2O by
thermal decomposition of KNO3 requires high temperature,
and this process can sometimes destroy the structure of supporting
materials. We herein report a solvent-assisted stepwise redox (SASR)
approach to generate zeolite NaA-supported K2O, which we
call K2O/NaA, that function as the solid base catalyst
for Michael addition reaction between ethanol and ethyl acrylate.
The solvent-assisted redox decomposition process of KNO3 at elevated temperature was investigated by thermogravimetry–mass
spectrometry. It reveals that after reducing a minor amount of KNO3 at 400 °C, the organic solvent decomposes to form carbon,
which promotes the reduction of KNO3 to generate strong
basicity on the zeolite NaA at 600 °C. The resulting material,
K2O/NaA-S, exhibits improved catalytic activity in Michael
addition reaction over other benchmark base catalysts that have been
used in this reaction. This catalyst is durable for at least four
catalytic cycles without apparent loss in activity. K2O/NaA-S
exhibits larger reaction rate constant yet lower activation energy
than K2O/NaA prepared by thermal decomposition method.
The SASR approach described in this paper represents a new blueprint
for the generation of the supported alkali oxide as the solid base
catalyst.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the current fine-chemical and petrochemical industry, several
organic transformations, such as addition, alkylation, and condensation,
proceed in a high-efficient manner over base catalysts.1 Heterogeneous catalysts with strong basicity
are of particular interest because they circumvent corrosion issues
and disposal problems of homogeneous counterparts.2 In this context, many attempts have been made to generate
basic species supported on porous materials, including zeolite, silica,
organic polymer, and metal-organic framework.3

Zeolites4−6 that exhibit permanent porosities have captured great
attention of researchers for decades in the field of catalytic materials.7,8 Their exceptional stability and amenability to the rational design
enable the exquisite control over the structure and functionality,
which in turn enhances the task-specific catalytic properties.9−14 In the context of the construction of supported base catalyst, it
is widely accepted that the simple ion-exchange method can fabricate
alkali metal cations (e.g., K+, Cs+) to the
cavity of the zeolite,15−19 but such materials sometimes exhibit leaching,20,21 which will significantly affect their catalytic activity. The reaction
between zeolite and gaseous ammonia at elevated temperature enables
the incorporation of NHx species in varieties
of zeolites, such as MCM-4822 and faujasite.23 The basicity of nitrided zeolite is higher than
alkali metal cation-exchanged zeolite.24 However, due to the high stability of the zeolite structure, the
nitridation process is difficult, leading to a reduced concentration
of basic sites.25 The surface grafting
with organic amine is another approach to generate basic sites in
the zeolite, but the grafted organic amine may block the channel,
which prohibit the mass transfer during the catalytic reaction.26

Porous materials containing high concentration
of alkali metal
oxide exhibit high basicity.27−30 Conventionally, supported alkali metal oxide is generated
from the thermal decomposition of the alkali nitrate as the precursor.
Nevertheless, only ca. 20% of alkali nitrate is able to be converted
to alkali oxide at temperatures higher than 700 °C.31,32 Further increasing the temperature will result in the collapse of
supporting materials.33 In 2013, Sun et
al. reported the redox approach, in which the SBA-15-supported KNO3 is reduced to form K2O, NO, and CO2 by the carbon. The carbon is derived from pyrolysis of the organic
polymer that is deliberately introduced into the networks of SBA-15.27 Yue et al. also reported that carbon plays a
reducing role for the synthesis of carbon-supported K2O.34 This approach was then extended by employing
methanol vapor instead of carbon to reduce the LiNO3 supported
on SBA-15.28 It should be noted that this
redox approach enables the nearly full conversion of the alkali nitrate.

It occurs to us that the redox approach is feasible for the generation
of alkali metal oxide on the zeolite. On the other hand, there is
no systematic study on the role of organic solvent other than carbon
and vapor in the redox approach. In this paper, we report a new solvent-assisted
stepwise redox (SASR) approach to generate K2O on zeolite
NaA (Scheme 1). In
particular, the use of the organic solvent realizes the fuse of two
types of reducing processes in the single SASR process: the solvent
first reduces a minor portion of supported KNO3 at 400
°C and then decomposes to carbon that further facilitates the
reduction of remaining KNO3 at 600 °C. We then address
the exceptional catalytic performance of prepared K2O/NaA
in the Michael addition reaction between ethanol and ethyl acrylate.35 The reaction is widely used in the global coating
industry to produce ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), a nonhazard air
pollution solvent particularly suitable for coating formulation.36

Scheme 1 Solvent-Assisted Redox Approach for the
Generation of K2O/NaA
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure
Characterization
According
to Figure 1a, pure
NaA exhibits good crystallinity. Compared to the parent NaA, several
new sharp peaks appear at 2θ = 23.9, 28.7, and 39.0°, corresponding
to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of K2O, respectively
(JCPDS 47-1701). Notably, the intensity of the K2O peak
in K2O/NaA-S is higher than that of K2O/NaA-I/II,
indicating that there are more K2O formed in K2O/NaA than in others. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis
was then carried out to study the decomposition of KNO3 in the SASR process. As shown in Figure 1b, for K2O/NaA-I and K2O/NaA-II, there are strong peaks at 1384 cm–1 ascribed
to nitrate anion. Conversely, the intensities of peaks corresponding
to nitrate anion decrease dramatically in K2O/NaA-S when
ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate was used as the solvent in the SASR approach.
Moreover, the band at 1270 cm–1 assigned to NO2– in K2O/NaA-I and K2O/NaA-II, which means a portion of KNO3, was converted
to KNO2 during the heating process, which is consistent
with the literature.37

(PXRD) patterns of pure NaA and K2O/NaA prepared by different
methods (black square = K2O) and (b) FT-IR spectra of pure
NaA and as-prepared K2O/NaA samples.

Figure 2a
shows
the N2 adsorption isotherms of all samples at 77 K. The
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface of zeolite NaA
is 42 m2/g. It is known that zeolite NaA is not a good
sorbent for N2 molecules.38 The
sharp increase of N2 adsorbed at low relative pressure
indicates that N2 molecules reside at the pore openings
in the NaA framework. However, all K2O/NaA samples exhibit
low BET surface areas of 7–9 m2/g. There is no apparent
N2 uptake at low N2 partial pressures. The sharp
increase of the N2 isotherm at high relative pressures
indicates the interparticle porosity. From the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis, the fabrication of K2O on zeolite NaA leads
to a significant change in the morphology of zeolite NaA (Figure 3a). For example,
in Figure 3d, the shape
of K2O/NaA-S particle becomes nonfaceted with coarse surface.
Hence, although K2O/NaA is nonporous, the surface defects
can provide additional channels for the ingress of the substrate and
egress of the product during the catalytic reaction.

We use Hammett indicators and temperature-programmed desorption
of CO2 (CO2-TPD) to investigate their basicity.
Pure NaA and K2O/NaA-I/II exhibit low basicity (H– < 9.8) and moderate basicity, respectively
(15.0 < H– < 18.4). K2O/NaA-S shows a color change in the solution of p-nitroaniline, suggesting a relatively high basicity (H– > 18.4). CO2-TPD of K2O/NaA-I
exhibits two peaks at 270 and 580 °C, corresponding to the desorption
of CO2 from the weak and moderate base sites (Figure 4). It is notable
that K2O/NaA-II and K2O/NaA-S show another strong
peak at about 780 °C. Importantly, according to the desorption
area of CO2, the concentration of total base sites in K2O/NaA-S is 2.33 mmol/g, in which the content of strong basic
sites (1.30 mmol/g) is much higher than in others (Table 1). To further confirm the basicity,
we perform potentiometric acid–base titration for all samples,
which shows similar total base concentrations to CO2-TPD.
In a word, the SASR approach can significantly enhance the basicity
of K2O/NaA.

2.2 Mechanism
of SASR Decomposition
To
study the mechanism of the decomposition of KNO3 in the
SASR approach, gaseous products generated during the heating process
were analyzed by thermogravimetry–mass spectrometry (TG–MS),
as shown in Figure 5a. The direct decomposition of KNO3 does not take place
until 700 °C, as indicated by two signals with m/z values of 30 and 32, which are attributed to
NO and O2 respectively. Accordingly, we use eq 1 to describe the conversion of KNO3 to K2O on zeolite NaA as follows: 1  During the generation of K2O/NaA-II,
the remaining KNO3 in K2O/NaA-I starts to decompose
from 800 °C in the second stage (Figure 5b). According to the literature,32 at this temperature, KNO3 can react
with the framework of zeolite NaA, giving rise to the collapse of
the structure. Conversely, K2O/NaA-S exhibits a different
TG–MS pattern from K2O/NaA-II (Figure 5c). After treated with EEP,
the remaining KNO3 in K2O/NaA-I undergoes a
different decomposition process. First, three signals with m/z values of 18, 30, and 44 attributed
to H2O, NO, and CO2, respectively, appear from
300 to 450 °C. Subsequently, a new signal with an m/z value of 32 starts to appear from 500 °C,
which indicates the generation of O2. It is beyond our
expectation that the H2O signal disappears, whereas the
intensities of signals with m/z values
of 30 and 44 within the temperature range of 500–650 °C
become higher than those in the previous temperature range. Thus,
it would be fair to propose that there are two types of reaction processes
during the preparation of K2O/NaA-S.

Figure 5 TG–MS signals
of (a) K2O/NaA-I, (b) K2O/NaA-II, and (c) K2O/NaA-S.

In the first reaction
process from 300 to 450 °C, the generation
of H2O, CO2, and NO indicates that the organic
solvent serves as the reducing agent for the conversion of KNO3, which is similar to the mechanism reported in the literature.28 The disappearance of H2O and the
appearance of O2 from 500 to 650 °C exclude the participation
of organic solvent as the reducing agent. The continuous generation
of CO2 prompts us to check the color of the catalyst after
ramping. Surprisingly, it becomes light gray compared to the white
color of the pure zeolite NaA (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Hence, the color difference indicates
the presence of carbon that may be generated from the pyrolysis of
ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate. Thus, the conversion of KNO3 on
the zeolite NaA within the temperature range of 500–650 °C
can be tentatively described as eq 2. 2  It should
be pointed out that the first stage
of SASR approach is also critical for the efficient conversion of
KNO3. The PXRD shows that if the pure NaA was soaked in
the organic solvent for a desired period of time right after being
impregnated with KNO3 solution, the subsequent heating
process cannot facilitate the redox conversion of impregnated KNO3 to K2O (Figure S2,
Supporting Information). The reason is that in the first stage of
SASR approach, the nitrate anions dissociate with the potassium cation
and are immobilized on threefold axes in the sodalite cage.39 The organic solvent/carbon are not able to reduce
the bulk KNO3 at 600 °C or higher.40

Figure 6a presents
the C 1s–K 2p region spectra of K2O/NaA-S. The C
1s spectra show two peaks at binding energies of 284.6 and 288.8 eV.
The major peak at 284.6 eV corresponds to the elemental carbon, while
the second weak peak at 288.8 eV is due to the minor amount of carbonate
species.41,42 Notably, the high intensity of the major
peak in C 1s spectra proves the presence of sufficient carbon rather
than adventitious carbon, and this is consistent with the color change
of K2O/NaA generated by the SASR approach. The K 2p spectra
exhibit a usual doublet with the binding energies of 292.9 (K 2p3/2) and 295.7 eV (K 2p1/2), which are assigned
to K+ and K–O species, respectively, according to
the literature of potassium-supported catalyst.43,44

Figure 6 X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images of fresh K2O/NaA-S:
(a) C 1s and K 2p spectra; (b) O 1s spectra.

Specifically, there are three O 1s signals at 528.7, 529.4,
and
531.5 eV (Figure 6b).
Wittayakun assigned the weak signal at 528.7 eV to the Si–O–K
species, whereas the strong signal at 529.4 eV represents combination
of Si–O and Al–O from the NaA framework.45,46 This result indicates a strong interaction between oxygen in the
zeolite framework and potassium, so the K2O is not only
encapsulated in the pores but also grafted on the framework of zeolite
NaA. The broad peak at the binding energy of 531.5 eV with reduced
intensity indicates the presence of the oxygen atom from the adventitious
carbonate, which matches the result from the C 1s spectra.

2.3 Catalytic Activity
2.3.1 Effect of Temperature
The catalytic
performance of all K2O/NaA catalysts was evaluated in the
context of addition reaction between ethanol and ethyl acrylate. This
catalytic reaction is greatly affected by the reaction temperature,
and the reaction temperature needs to be optimized as it is highly
associated with the energy cost of the reaction (Figure 7a). The experiments were conducted
using 10 wt % catalyst of ethyl acrylate and 8:1 molar ratio between
ethanol and ethyl acrylate at different temperatures (50, 60, 70,
and 80 °C). As shown in Figure 7a, with the increase of reaction temperature, the conversion
of ethyl acrylate increased. However, the conversion of ethyl acrylate
reaches the limitation of 95% at 70 °C. Increasing the reaction
temperature to 80 °C only accelerates the reaction at the beginning,
but the reaction quickly reaches equilibrium after ca. 3 h with negligible
increase of conversion from 95 to 96%. Therefore, the optimal temperature
for the synthesis of EEP is 70 °C, at which we obtain a high
conversion of up to 95% and selectivity of EEP of up to 99%.

Figure 7 Catalytic conversion
of ethyl acrylate and selectivity of EEP under
different reaction conditions: (a) different catalysts; (b) different
molar ratios of raw materials; (c) different catalyst loadings; and
(d) different temperatures.

2.3.2 Effect of Molar Ratio
The molar
ratio of ethanol to ethyl acrylate is a very important parameter that
affects the conversion of ethyl acrylate to EEP (Figure 7b). The stoichiometric ratio
between ethanol and ethyl acrylate for the reaction is 1:1, but in
practice, the molar ratio should be higher than the stoichiometric
ratio to obtain more products. To investigate the effect of molar
ratio, several reactions were conducted by changing the molar ratio
of ethanol to ethyl acrylate from 5:1 to 10:1, while keeping the temperature
and catalyst amount constant at 70 °C and 10 wt %, respectively.
As shown in Figure 8, with an increase of ethanol, the conversion of ethyl acrylate increased
initially. The molar ratio 8:1 gives rise to the conversion of 95%,
but continuing the increase of the molar ratio to 10:1 had no significant
effect on the increase of conversion. Therefore, the optimum molar
ratio of ethanol to ethyl acrylate to produce EEP is determined as
8:1.

Figure 8 Reusability of K2O/NaA-S: (a) reaction time at 50% (±1%)
conversion of ethyl acrylate and (b) conversion of ethyl acrylate
and selectivity of EEP after 8 h.

2.3.3 Effect of Catalyst Loading
Then,
we varied the catalyst loading in the range of 5–12 wt % with
respect to the weight of ethyl acrylate to explore the optimal catalyst
loading for the reaction (Figure 7c). The conversion of ethyl acrylate is positively
related to the catalyst loading, whereas the amount of conversion
increases with time, and the rate of conversion falls with the catalyst
loading especially after 5 h. Moreover, the final conversion of ethyl
acrylate exhibited by 12 wt % catalyst loading is close to 10 wt %.
Therefore, 10 wt % catalyst loading was selected as the optimal catalyst
loading.

2.3.4 Comparison of Catalytic
Property
After screening out the optimal reaction condition,
we compare the
catalytic properties of K2O/NaA-S and other benchmark base
catalysts. The results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 7d. K2O/NaA-S exhibits much better catalytic
activity than K2O/NaA-I and II in terms of conversion of
ethyl acrylate due to the high concentration of basic sites. The byproduct
of this reaction is polyacrylate, but all K2O/NaA catalysts
exhibit the selectivity of EEP higher than 97%. We then compared the
catalytic performance of K2O/NaA-S with other base catalysts
that have been used in this reaction. As shown in Table 2, K2O/Al2O3 was investigated as the solid base catalyst for addition
reaction between ethanol and ethyl acrylate by Qiao.47 However, the conversion of ethyl acrylate is much lower
than K2O/NaA-S. PPh3 is a homogeneous catalyst,
but its basicity is not high enough to achieve high conversion and
selectivity.48 Notably, the catalytic performance
of K2O/NaA-S is close to that of potassium ethylate, which
is a homogeneous catalyst used in the industry.49 Therefore, we chose K2O/NaA-S for further investigation.

2.3.5 Reusability Study
To investigate
the reusability of K2O/NaA-S, the catalyst was centrifuged
and separated from the reaction mixture after the reaction. The catalyst
was subsequently activated at 150 °C under vacuum overnight before
starting a new cycle. The catalytic activities for each cycle are
shown in Figure 8.
When the conversion of ethyl acrylate reaches 50% (±1%) in each
cycle, the reaction time increases gradually from 38 min (fresh) to
50 min (fourth run) (Figure 8a). In terms of the final conversion at the eighth hour, there
is a minor reduction from 95% (fresh) to 91% (fourth cycle), but the
selectivities for all recycled runs are the same as that in the first
run (Figure 8b). X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) study suggests that the mole ratio of K/Al reduces
from 0.255 to 0.239 after four catalytic cycles. It means a slight
leaching of K+ cation during the reaction so that the conversion
of ethyl acrylate decreases (Table S1,
Supporting Information). The recycled catalyst reactivated by another
SASR process after the KNO3 treatment exhibits conversion
and selectivity close to the fresh catalyst (Table S1). This can be explained by the fact that the impregnation
of additional KNO3 to the used catalyst, followed by SASR
process will regenerate the lost catalytic sites. Importantly, the
reaction mixture containing EEP, ethanol, and ethyl acrylate is likely
to serve as the reducing agent for the redox conversion of KNO3.

2.4 Kinetic Study
Kinetic study of the
addition reaction between ethanol and ethyl acrylate was carried out
using K2O/NaA-S as a catalyst. We expressed the rate of
the reaction based on the pseudo-first-order model shown below 3   4  where CA, CB, and CC represent
molar concentrations of ethanol, ethyl acrylate, and ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate
(EEP), respectively, and r, k, and W are the reaction rate, rate constant of the reaction,
and weight of the catalyst, respectively. We express the relationship
between the rate constant and temperature by the Arrhenius equation 5  where Ea is the
activation energy (kJ/mol) and A represents the pre-exponential
factor (L2/(mol g h)).

According to the Arrhenius
equation, we transform the reaction rate equation into the following
pseudo-first-order differential equation 6  The
results are shown in Table 3. The activation energy (Ea) for
the synthesis of ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate
(EEP) is 62.05 kJ/mol with the catalyst K2O/NaA-I. There
is only a slight reduction of activation energy with the catalyst
K2O/NaA-II (59.64 kJ/mol). In contrast, a reduced activation
energy of 45.13 kJ/mol is obtained with K2O/NaA-S as catalyst
under the given condition, suggesting a higher catalytic efficiency
of K2O/NaA-S over K2O/NaA-I and K2O/NaA-II.

and Ethanol Addition Reaction

Ea– (kJ/mol)	74.72	71.96	71.28	
R2	0.9967	0.9921	0.9985	
We then calculated the rate constants (k+) of two systems from the activation energy
(Ea) and the pre-exponential factor (A) according
to the Arrhenius equation. As shown in Table 4, at temperatures of 60, 70, and 80 °C,
the rate constants for the catalyst K2O/NaA-S are 5.70,
9.16, and 14.35 L2/(mol g h), respectively. In contrast,
the rate constants in the K2O/NaA-I catalyst system are
only 0.69, 1.33, and 2.47 L2/(mol g h), respectively, under
the same conditions, which are significantly lower than those for
the catalyst K2O/NaA-S. We ascribe the low activation energy
and the high rate constant of K2O/NaA-S to its high K2O concentration in the structure. To verify the effectiveness
of the developed models, we compared the calculated values with the
experimental data. The pseudo-first-order model provides a relatively
good fit for the experimental results (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

2.5 Structure–Property Relationship
On the basis of results discussed above, we envisioned that the structure,
or more specifically the basicity, plays a critical role for the catalytic
properties. To obtain more data for investigation, we extended this
SASR approach to other organic solvents, including ethanol and ethyl
acrylate. The resulting compounds, K2O/NaA-ET and K2O/NaA-EA, exhibit similar PXRD patterns, FT-IR spectra, XPS
images, TG–MS patterns, and morphologies to K2O/NaA-S
(Figures S4–S7). It is interesting
to note that, according to the desorption area of CO2-TPD
(Figure S8), the concentration of total
base sites in K2O/NaA-S is 2.33 mmol/g (Table S4) larger than those of K2O/NaA-ET (1.89
mmol/g) and K2O/NaA-EA (2.18 mmol/g). Correspondingly,
the activation energy and rate constant of K2O/NaA-ET and
K2O/NaA-EA are higher than those of K2O/NaA-S
(Tables S2 and S3). We tentatively attribute
the difference in the base concentration to the volatility of the
solvent. A portion of solvent with low boiling point may evaporate
during the SASR process.

To demonstrate the relationship between
the basicity and activity, we first perform correlation analysis between
the base concentration and the conversion and kinetic parameters.
The absolute values of the correlation coefficient between total base
concentration and the conversion and activation energies are 0.94
and 0.96, respectively. However, correlation coefficients between
high base concentration and the conversion and activation energies
are both 0.99, suggesting a stronger correlation between the strong
base concentration and the three variables.

Then, we used the
regression analysis method to explore the effect
of high base concentration on the conversion of ethyl acrylate and
activation energy. The conversion enhances with increase of base concentration
with a good linear correlation between them (Figure 9a). The linear equation is conversion = 37.68
× Cstrong base + 46.17 with
a coefficient of R2 = 0.989, where Cstrong base is the strong base concentration.
On the other hand, the activation energy is also proportional to the
strong base concentration, and the calibration plot is revealed in Figure 9b. There is a good
linear relationship between them, and the correlation equation is
determined as E = −12.73 × Cstrong base + 61.82 with a correlation coefficient
of R2 = 0.991. Both results of regression
analysis present that the catalytic activity is profoundly related
to the concentration of strong base according to the fixed linearity
under the current reaction condition. Thus, the high conversion of
ethyl acrylate is indeed realized by using the SASR approach to generate
strong base catalyst.

and conversion

3 Conclusions
In summary, we report herein a solvent-assisted stepwise redox
approach to generate K2O/NaA as solid base catalyst. The
SASR process combines two types of redox decomposition pathways for
the generation of supported K2O at relatively low temperatures.
Hence, it is likely to serve as a new blueprint for the efficient
redox decomposition of alkali nitrate on the zeolite. The investigation
of catalytic properties show that K2O/NaA-S is a good catalyst
for the Michael addition between ethanol and ethyl acrylate with an
EEP yield of ca. 94%. This catalytic activity outperformed most of
the reported solid base catalysts. Our study also reveals that the
catalytic reaction obey pseudo-first-order model, and the high concentration
of the supported K2O can significantly reduce the reaction
activation energy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Jiangsu Nine Heaven High-Tech
provides zeolite NaA (≥99.0%). KNO3 (≥99.0%),
ethyl acrylate (≥98.0%), ethanol (≥99.7%), and Hammett
indicator set are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1-Propanol (≥99.0%)
was purchased from J&K. All chemicals were used without further
purification.

4.2 SASR Approach
There are two steps
in the SASR approach. In the first step, the KNO3 solution
(0.15 g/mL, 2 mL) was added dropwise into the zeolite NaA (2 g) in
the beaker and the mixture was sonicated for 2 h. After filtration,
the zeolite NaA was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h and was
subsequently heated to 600 °C under N2 with a ramping
rate of 10 °C/min. The temperature was maintained for 4 h, giving
rise to the compound denoted as K2O/NaA-I.

In the
second step, the as-prepared K2O/NaA-I was soaked in EEP
and sonicated for 4 h followed by filtration. The obtained wet solid
was directly heated to 600 °C again in a N2 flow with
a ramping rate of 2 °C/min. After 4 h, the as-prepared compound
was denoted as K2O/NaA-S. For comparison, K2O/NaA-I directly heated in the second step without the solvent treatment
was denoted as K2O/NaA-II.

4.3 Catalyst
Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku SmartLab
diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA for Cu Kα (λ = 1.5416
Å) radiation at a scan rate of 10°/min in 2θ. Crystal
phases were identified by using the power diffraction file database
(JCPDS, International Centre for Diffraction Data) as the reference.
Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry data were
collected on Bruker model SRS3400 to determine the bulk composition
of a catalyst. The potassium content was measured by XRF in the fresh
and spent catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement
was performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe spectrometer equipped with
a monochromatic Al Kα anode. The charging effects were corrected
by using C 1s band at the binding energy of 284.6 eV.

Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected on a Thermo-Nicolet
AVATAR 360 IR spectrometer over the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a KBr detector at room temperature. N2 adsorption analysis was performed on a BELSORP-miniII adsorption
instrument. All samples were activated at 200 °C overnight under
vacuum before analysis. Temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) analysis was carried out on a Micromeritics
ASAP 2920 instrument at the ramping rate of 10 °C/min from 100
to 800 °C. Basicities of the as-prepared catalysts were also
investigated using a Hammett indicator procedure. In a typical analysis,
ca. 0.1 mL of the Hammett indicator was added to 200 mg of sample
in a watch glass. The color change of the solution defines the strong
base. The Hammett indicators used in the analysis were bromothymol
blue (H– = 7.2), phenolphthalein
(H– = 9.8), 2,4-dinitroaniline
(H– = 15.0), and 4-nitroaniline
(H– = 18.4). In addition, the base
concentration of the as-prepared catalysts was also determined by
potentiometric acid–base titration on ZDJ-4B with HCl (0.01
mol/L) solution as the titrant. The catalyst was dispersed in deionized
water and then ultrasonicated for 5 h before measurement. The parameters
of titration end point (pH 7), precontrol point (pH 8), precontrol
amount (40%), and stirring speed (18 revolutions/s) were set before
titration. The basicity of the catalyst was calculated from the amount
of HCl solution used.

The thermal stabilities of the samples
were evaluated by thermogravimetric
analysis on an NETZSCH STA 449 instrument from 30 to 1000 °C
at a ramping rate of 10 °C/min under a N2 flow of
20 mL/min. Gaseous products generated from thermal decomposition were
analyzed by mass spectroscopy.

4.4 Procedure
for Catalytic Reactions
All catalysts were activated using
the same procedure used for gas
sorption studies. In a typical run, a desired amount of the activated
catalyst was added to ethanol. After heating to the desired reaction
temperature, ethyl acrylate was added dropwise into the reactor under
magnetic stirring. During the reaction, a small portion of reaction
mixture was collected from the reactor at certain time intervals.
All collected samples were analyzed by gas chromatography using a
capillary 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm XE-60 column and
a flame ionization detector, in which 1-propanol was used as the internal
standard.
