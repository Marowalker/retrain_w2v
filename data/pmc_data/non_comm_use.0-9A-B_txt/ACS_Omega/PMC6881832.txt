Perylenediimides (PDIs) have emerged
as potential materials for
optoelectronic applications. In the current work, four PDI derivatives,
substituted at imide nitrogen with 2,6-diisopropyl phenyl, 2-nitrophenyl,
diphenylmethylene, and pentafluorophenyl groups, have been synthesized
from perylene 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride using a facile
imidization synthesis process. PDI derivatives have been spectroscopically
characterized for their structure and optical properties. Temperature-variable
absorption and emission spectroscopy study confirmed the H-aggregation
property. H-aggregation along with strong emission suggests the slipped
π–π stacking of PDI molecules. Electrochemical
analysis was performed for their redox behavior and calculation of
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and highest occupied molecular
orbital energy levels. Scanning electron microscopy showed the formation
of ordered structures. The PDI derivatives showed excellent electron
conductivity without doping and 5–10× higher electron
mobility than that of state-of-the-art fullerene acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Finally,
the charge generation and charge transfer phenomenon was studied by
transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). TAS showed ultrafast charge
transfer from the poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT) donor polymer to PDI
and formation of long-lived charge-separated states similar to fullerene
derivative PC61BM/P3HT blends. Such PDI derivatives with
excellent solubility and photophysical and electronic properties are
potential n-type materials to be used in organic electronic devices.

1 Introduction
Low-temperature solution-processable organic semiconductor materials
are the requirement of current time for low-cost large-area fabrication
of organic electronic devices on flexible substrates.1 Compared to p-type organic semiconductor materials, n-type
materials are relatively fewer and mainly focused on fullerene and
its derivatives.2 Rylene materials have
got great attention in recent years, and several reports are available
for their applications in organic electronic devices.3 Specially, perylenediimides (PDIs) have shown their potential
to be used in organic electronics.4 These
molecules exhibit promising properties like strong light absorption,
i.e., in the range of 400–450 nm (B band) and 500–700
nm (Q band)5 due to their extended conjugated
π systems, self-assembling properties,6 low-lying frontier molecular orbitals, excellent electron mobility,7 high electron affinity, and photochemical and
thermal stabilities.8,9 These molecules have been used
for various applications like organic light emitting diodes,10 organic field effect transistors (OFETs),11 organic solar cells,12−14 optical limiting15 and photochromic materials,16 etc. On the other hand, PDIs also possess some drawbacks
like strong tendency of π–π stacking due to the
planar structure resulting in limited solubility, poor fluorescence,
and trapping of excitons in organic solar cells.17,18 Charge carrier mobility is highly influenced by the morphology of
materials and intermolecular interaction of molecules in films.19 There is need to synthesize PDI derivatives
to generate photoluminescent (PL) charge transfer (CT) excitons. Therefore,
to overcome these drawbacks, various groups are working through molecular
designing, resulting in photoluminescent aggregates with facilitated
charge transport and also developing new routes for the fabrication
of air-stable organic devices.20−24

The properties of PDIs have been tuned by modification of
the substituents
at imide nitrogen and bay positions. The substitution at imide nitrogen
with strong electron-withdrawing groups shows little effect on optical
and electronic properties but affects solubility. However, bay substituents
affect electronic and optical properties, resulting in alteration
of photophysical properties.25,26 In 2007, Marder and
co-workers synthesized the first conjugated polymer-acceptor having
the bay-substituted PDI with alternating dithienothiophene and PDI
units exhibiting high electron mobility ∼1.3 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 and high electron affinity with a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) energy level of −3.9 eV.27 The charge carrier mobility for this molecule was characterized
in OFET geometry. Absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy techniques
have been used as the main tool to study the PDI aggregation behavior.
There is still lack of complete characterization and analysis of substituents’
effect on electrical and photophysical properties in neat as well
donor/PDI blends. There are only a few reports on the study of PDI/donor
mixtures for charge separation dynamics.28 Recently, Tamai and co-workers reported the time evolution of electroabsorption
caused by the electric field generated within electron–hole
pairs using transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) in a polymer solar
cell with a perylene diimide (PDI) dimer acceptor.29 From the study, they found that the charge carriers were
generated very efficiently, i.e., ∼90% of quantum yield, and
separated within <1 ps.

To expand the scope of PDI materials
for efficient charge generation
and charge separation and transport, the present work describes the
synthesis and characterization of four PDI derivatives having a strong
electron acceptor core substituted with different amine groups at
the imide N position (Figure 1). We have chosen two electron-donating [iso-propylphenyl
(iPrP) and diphenylmethylene (DPM)] substituents
and two electron-withdrawing [nitrophenyl ((NO2P)) and
pentafluorophenyl (PFP)] substituents on the N-position and performed
a comprehensive study of photophysical, electrochemical, and electron
transport properties. These photoluminescent PDI derivatives form
well-defined self-assembly, resulting in excellent optical and electrical
properties. Electrical conductivity measurements were performed at
different temperatures to study the effect of temperature on electrical
current. The charge transport measurements of PDI derivatives were
evaluated by the standard space charge limited current (SCLC) model
and compared with the state-of-the-art fullerene acceptor phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Transient
absorption spectroscopy (TAS) ascertained ultrafast charge separation
and formation of long-lived charge-separated states in these PDI derivatives
on mixing with donor polymer poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT).

2 Results and Discussion
In the present work, we have
synthesized four n-type perylene diimide
(PDI) derivatives using a straightforward single-step reaction. The
products were isolated as red solid materials and showed good solubility
in chloroform and toluene (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 General Synthesis Scheme of PDI Derivatives
The structure of PDI derivatives was confirmed
by Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) and 1H NMR spectroscopy techniques. The
parent material perylene 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA)
showed well-defined stretching peaks of dianhydride C=O at
1778 and 1761 cm–1 along with the aromatic C–H
stretching peak at 3080 and aromatic C=C stretching peak at
1581 cm–1 (Figure S1).30 On reaction with amines, substitution of anhydride
oxygen with amine nitrogen takes place with formation of imide. To
assure the formation of diimide without any impurity of monoimide,
we performed FTIR spectroscopy of products and compared with that
of precursor PTCDA. Anhydride carbonyl peaks completely disappeared
in products with appearance of new intense peaks of C=O stretching
(Figures S2 and S3). The other peaks of
PTCDA, viz. 3035 (m, Ar–H) and 1592 (m, Ar C=C) cm–1 were retained in all of the products.

1H NMR further confirmed the formation and purity of
PDI derivatives and showed all of the alkyl and aromatic proton peaks.
In iPrP-PDI, aromatic and aliphatic protons were
clearly observed (Figure S4A). Eight aromatic
protons of the PDI core appeared at 8.66 ppm. Six protons of the phenyl
ring appeared at 7.38 and 7.13 ppm. Moreover, 24 methyl protons of
the diisopropyl group were observed at 1.2 ppm and the peaks of four
methanetriyl protons were clearly seen at 2.6 ppm. The molecular ion
peak of iPrP-PDI appearing at m/z 711.3178 in the mass spectrum (Figure S4B) confirmed the formation of the desired product. For NO2P-PDI, eight aromatic protons of the PDI core and eight phenyl
protons of the nitrophenyl group were clearly seen at 8.67 ppm and
at 7.28 and 7.45 ppm, respectively (Figure S5A). The molecular ion peak of NO2P-PDI was observed at m/z 633.1704 (Figure S5B). For DPM-PDI, the 22 aromatic protons of the diphenylmethylene
group appeared between 6.9 and 7.4 ppm and eight aromatic protons
of the PDI core were observed at 8.67 ppm (Figure S6A). The m/z peak of DPM-PDI
appeared at m/z 722.1506 (Figure S6B). 1H NMR spectra of PFP-PDI
showed the eight aromatic protons of the PDI core between 8.58 and
8.9 ppm (Figure S7A). The molecular ion
peak of PFP-PDI was observed at m/z 722.0728 (Figure S7B).

2.1 Steady-State
Absorption and Photoluminescence
(PL) study
UV–visible absorption and photoluminescence
study has been performed to characterize optical properties of PDI
derivatives in solutions and in films. In dilute chloroform solution
(0.01 mM), all of the PDIs showed distinct absorption bands at ∼450,
490, and 520 (Figure 2A and Table 1) for
π–π* electronic transitions, namely, 0–2,
0–1, and 0–0, respectively, for monomeric PDI chromophores
in agreement with the literature for other perylenediimides31 and the Franck–Codon factor is in the
order A(0–0) > A(0–1) > A(0–2).32

The substituents on PDIs cause changes in relative
absorbance of
0–1/0–0 absorption bands.33 The relative intensity for the 0–1/0–0 transition
was found to be 65, 98, 65, and 67% for iPrP-PDI,
NO2P-PDI, DPM-PDI, and PFP-PDI, respectively, indicating
high probability of free PDI 0–0 transition in all of the cases
except NO2P-PDI. The nitrophenyl substituent causes enhanced
0–1 transition compared to other substituents, which may be
due to different packing conformation in molecular self-assembly34 (also discussed in Section 2.5), resulting in a mixture of monomeric
and aggregated molecules. DPM-PDI shows additional absorption due
to charge transfer (CT) exciton at 572 nm as also observed by Würthner
et al., for an aryl-substituted PDI derivative in solution.35 Absorption spectra were also recorded in films
and show significantly broader absorption extended up to 800 nm (Figure 2B). A bathochromic
shift was observed in films compared to solution (Table 1) as also observed for N,N′-bis(phenyl) PDI aggregates
due to long-range Coulombic coupling.36 Also, the relative absorbance of 0–1/0–0 bands was
increased (94, 105, 93, and 108% for the four PDIs, respectively)
due to aggregate formation.

PDI derivatives were further characterized
for their fluorescence
properties in solution and films as fluorescence is sensitive to the
aggregation behavior of PDI. All of the PDI derivatives showed distinct
emission bands at ∼550, 580, and 620 nm for 0–0, 1–0,
and 2–0 transitions, respectively, in solution (Figure 3A). Small Stokes shifts were
observed for all of the PDIs, indicating structural rigidity (Table 1). Appearance of high
emission intensity suggests monomeric nature of PDI molecules in solution.37 In films, distinct emission bands for 0–0,
1–0, and 2–0 transitions appeared at ∼483, 528,
and 540 nm, respectively (Figure 3B). Excimer emission was observed in all of the four
PDI films between ∼600 and 750 nm as also observed by Chen
et al., for fluorescent triarylphenyl-group-bearing PDI film due to
face-to-face stacked dye aggregates.38

solution and (B) spin-coated films on excitation with 450 nm.

We performed the concentration-variable absorption
study in toluene
to analyze the aggregate formation in detail.39 Chloroform is the preferred solvent, and no aggregation was observed
for PDI on increasing concentration; therefore, we chose toluene,
a low-polarity solvent, to study the concentration effect on absorption.
No shift was observed for band position with an increase in concentration;
however, all of the PDIs showed change in absorbance. As can be seen
in Figure S8, absorption due to the 0–1
vibronic transition in iPrP-PDI increases with increasing
concentration from 5 μM to 0.5 mM. All vibronic features are
lost in 0.5 mM solution, indicating electronic coupling between the
molecules resulting in high aggregation.40 For NO2P-PDI also, 0–1 transition absorbance increases
and reaches 0–0 transition absorbance but still is well defined.
Interestingly, in DPM-PDI, absorbance at 575 nm increases and becomes
equal to 0–0 transition absorbance at 0.5 mM concentration.
This suggests aggregate formation with arrangement of molecule to
effectively enhance the charge transfer between the perylene core
and diphenylmethylene moiety. For PFP-PDI, we do not observe any effect
of concentration increase on the absorption band structure and the
relative intensity for the 0–1/0–0 transition is also
maintained, indicating no significant ground state interaction between
the PDI core of PFP-PDI molecules even at high concentration. Finally,
we performed the analysis of the ratio of 0–1 vibronic transition
absorbance to 0–0 vibronic transition absorbance {A(0–1)/A(0–0)} with variation of concentration. This analysis allows us to identify
the proximity of PDI molecules in solution. As reported by Wang et
al.,41 a larger A(0–1)/A(0–0) ratio
promotes aggregate formation compared to lower A(0–1)/A(0–0). They
also observed the increase of the A(0–1)/A(0–0) ratio with the concentration
increase due to increased aggregation. In the present study also,
there is increase in the A(0–1)/A(0–0) ratio on increasing the
concentration. However, in any case, 0–1 transition absorbance
is not higher than that of the 0–0 transition (A(0–1)/A(0–0) ratio ≤ 1). The exact face-to-face stacked H-aggregation
results in 0–1 transition absorbance higher than that of the
0–0 transition.42 This observation
suggests that the four PDIs have slipped face-to-face H-aggregation.
PFP-PDI and DPM-PDI show least aggregate formation (Figure S9) and the A(0–1)/A(0–0) ratio remains below 80%
up to 0.5 mM concentration. However, iPrP-PDI and
NO2P-PDI show high aggregate formation above 50 μM
concentration of the solution as also discussed above.

Temperature-variable
absorbance (40 μM toluene solution)
and photoluminescence (0.5 mM toluene solution) experiments were performed
in toluene solution. The temperature was varied from 20 to 80 °C.
Except PFP-PDI, all of the PDIs showed increase in absorbance on increasing
the temperature along with a blue shift (Figure S11). The increase in absorbance with temperature indicates
the presence of aggregates at low temperature, which convert into
monomers on raising the temperature. PFP-PDI showed a decrease in
absorbance with an increase in temperature, and the rationale could
be temperature-induced disruption of molecular stacking. As observed
earlier, no effect of increasing concentration on PFP-PDI supports
the assumption. The temperature-variable emission study also showed
intensity enhancement with a blue shift, indicating H-type aggregation
(Figure S12). It is interesting observation,
as H-aggregated PDIs show very weak emission,35a,36c while in the present case, the strong photoluminescence with H-aggregation
indicates rotationally displaced π–π stacked PDI
molecules and needs theoretical support, which is beyond the scope
of the current paper. Based on the absorption and photoluminescence
study, we anticipate good electron conductivity and mobility in these
PDI molecules due to effective π–π stacking and
charge generation as discussed in later sections.

2.2 Electrochemical Analysis
The electrochemical
properties of the products were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials and energy levels.
CV was performed in a three-electrode system, where a platinum disc
was used as a working electrode, silver wire was used as a reference
electrode, and platinum wire was used as a counter electrode. These
CV plots were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferricenium couple as
an internal reference to optimize the redox potentials. Reversible
reduction potentials were observed for all of the PDIs as shown in Figure 4. The LUMO energy
level of PDI derivatives was estimated from the onset reduction potential
as summarized in Table 2. These values were measured from the empirical formula EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eonset(red/oxi) + 4.8 eV) and are in accordance with the reported literature.43 NO2P-PDI and PFP-PDI having electron-withdrawing
substituents show lower first reduction potential than iPrP-PDI and DPM-PDI. They also exhibit lower LUMO levels due to the
presence of electron-withdrawing groups, suggesting stable anion formation
and stability toward oxidation.44 The band
gap was calculated from the absorption edge and further used to calculate
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (Table 2). PDIs with electron-donating
groups show uplifted HOMO energy levels and lower band gaps due to
the increased electron density. The energy levels and band gaps are
in good agreement with previously reported data.44

2.3 Self-Assembled Structures
The self-assembly
of synthesized molecules into well-ordered one-dimensional supramolecular
structures is highly dependent on the thermodynamic processes. Along
with this, self-assembly of PDI derivatives is also highly dependent
on the molecular stacking as well as on solubility.45 The photophysical study in solution and films indicates
strong π–π interactions between PDI molecules.
It is important to observe their self-organizing behavior using the
microscopy study; therefore, we performed scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis of casted films over a glass substrate using 0.5 mM
toluene solution followed by annealing at 120 °C. The films were
annealed to keep the same morphology as in the conductivity experiment
and electron-only devices (Sections 2.4 and 2.5). As
can be seen in Figure 5, iPrP-PDI shows globular structures, which may
be due to distorted π–π staking, preventing PDI
molecules to assemble in one direction.34b However, all other PDIs show tubular rod structures due to π–π
stacking of PDI chromophore. The length of rods was in the range of
few tens of microns and width ∼500 nm as can be seen in Figure 5B–D. The SEM
study further confirms the π–π stacking of PDI
molecules with ordered structures as also concluded by the absorption
and emission study.

2.4 Electrical Conductivity
We analyzed
the electrical conductivity of PDI derivatives at different temperatures
varying from 60 to 120 °C (Figure S14) for determining thermal-activated electrical conductivity. In our
previous study, we have observed an increase in electrical conductivity
with rise in temperature for HD-NDI materials without any additive.46 Under dark testing conditions, a significant
increase in electrical current was observed with an increase in voltage
and so the conductivity (Figure S14). On
the other hand, current also increases with an increase in test temperature,
suggesting better stacking of PDI molecules, facilitating electron
transport. A heating–cooling cycle was performed, and reversible
performance was observed, indicating the robust structure of PDI derivatives
under heating. Among the four PDIs, NO2P-PDI showed the
highest increase in current on increase in temperature and thus was
most sensitive to temperature change. Such materials may find applications
in temperature sensors.47 This also supports
the observation in Section 2.2, where NO2P-PDI shows different behavior than
other PDIs due to higher disorder. The highest conductivity of NO2P-PDI and DPM-PDI observed at 100 °C was ∼5 ×
10–4 and 1 × 10–4 S m–1, respectively, while iPrP-PDI and
PFP-PDI showed highest conductivity of ∼0.64 × 10–4 and 3.3 × 10–4 S m–1, respectively, at 120 °C, which are very impressive among the
rylene-diimides without additives.46,48 At high temperatures,
the electron transport is facilitated by providing thermal energy
to overcome the energy barrier due to disorders. In the present study
also, the increase in temperature facilitates the electron transport
as also observed earlier for symmetric columnar PDIs.47

2.5 Electron Transport Studies
The electron
mobility of all of the synthesized materials was investigated at variable
thickness via standard electron-only device geometry as shown in Figure 6.46,49,50 The solution in chlorobenzene was prepared
with different concentrations of 20, 30, and 40 mg/mL. A high boiling
solvent is used to prepare solutions as the films are casted by spin-coating.
A high boiling solvent like chlorobenzene evaporates slowly and forms
continuous smooth film without pin holes. The PDI solution was spin-coated
on top of the indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO substrate with annealing
at 80 °C, and charge carrier mobility was determined from the
SCLC model as shown in (Figure S15). By
using the SCLC model, the current shows quadratic dependency on voltage
at room temperature. With the help of the Mott–Gurney equation,
electron mobility can be calculated  Herein, J stands
for the
current density, μ is the mobility of the organic semiconductor,
ε refers to the permittivity of medium, L is
the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer, and V is the applied voltage.

Figure 6 Schematic of the fabricated electron-only device
with the energy
level diagram of corresponding layers.

Generally the charge carrier mobility in organic materials is low
due to structural disorders in the films and decreases with decreasing
film thickness. In the present work also, charge carrier mobility
was found to decrease with decreasing active layer thickness. The
calculated electron mobilities for PDI derivatives with variable thickness
are summarized in Table 3. The highest mobility values for all PDIs achieved with 200 nm thickness
were 1.04 × 10–3, 0.58 × 10–3, 0.91 × 10–3, and 0.504 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 for iPrP-PDI, NO2P-PDI, DPM-PDI, and PFP-PDI, respectively.
The decreased film thickness mainly limits the charge carrier injection
in the bulk of the material, which leads to the reduced carrier collection
rate, resulting in decreased charge carrier mobility. However, all
of the PDIs show comparable electron mobility to other reported PDIs
(measured by the SCLC method).43 Also,
these PDIs show 5–10× higher mobility than that of the
state-of-the-art fullerene acceptor PC61BM (0.1 ×
10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1), making these PDIs potential acceptor materials
for non-fullerene organic solar cells.50

2.6 Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
(TAS) Study
Transient absorption spectroscopy has been performed
to study the
generation of charge-separated states in the donor/PDI blends for
their future applications as acceptors in organic solar cells. We
have chosen the most common donor polymer, i.e., P3HT. PDIs show formation
of a singlet excited state after ∼1 ps delay time between 650
and 950 nm, but no further transient species are observed in their
TAS spectra due to very low efficiency of intersystem crossing.51 For the P3HT/PDI blend pump–probe measurement,
480 nm excitation wavelength was used to selectively excite P3HT molecules.
Neat P3HT solution was used as a reference for determining the charge
transfer mechanism in blends. The transient absorption spectra of
P3HT (Figure S16) and mixture with different
PDI derivatives in chloroform solution as a function of probe delay
time have been shown in Figures 7 and 8. The transient absorption
spectrum of P3HT below 2 ps showed strong stimulated emission (SE)
at 580 and 625 nm. Transient absorption appears after 2 ps at ∼1140
nm with a lifetime of 530 ps for the singlet excited state absorption
of P3HT.52

(B) NO2P-PDI mixtures with P3HT in the UV–visible
region on excitation with 480 nm wavelength.

Figure 8 Transient
absorption spectra of (A) DPM-PDI and (B) PFP-PDI mixtures
with P3HT in the UV–visible region on excitation with 480 nm
wavelength.

The transient absorption spectra
of the P3HT mixture with PDI derivatives
(equimolar) show completely different spectra than neat P3HT. In the
P3HT/iPrP-PDI mixture, ground state absorption (GSA)
bleaching due to PDI was observed at ∼525 nm, while stimulated
emission appeared at 575 and 625 nm (for the locally excited states)
with lifetimes of 3.3 ns, 152 ps, and 390 ps, respectively (Figure 7A). After 1 ps of
delay time, the strong transient absorption peak appears at 702 nm
for the singlet excited state of the iPrP-PDI anion
radical (PDI–•) with a lifetime of 6 ns and
disappearance of excited state emission.37,53 Transient absorption also appears between 750 and 800 nm with maxima
at ∼780 nm for the P3HT cation radical (P3HT+•) with a lifetime of 1 ns. At the same time, the lifetime of the
singlet excited state of P3HT at ∼1140 nm was reduced to 172
ps in the mixture. Similar to iPrP-PDI, all other
PDIs also showed GSA and SE after ∼2 ps delay time. The stimulated
emission was observed at 575 nm (219 ps), 630 nm (126 ps); 575 nm
(214 ps), 630 nm (26 ps); and 575 nm (168 ps) (lifetime in parentheses)
for NO2P-PDI, DPM-PDI, and PFP-PDI respectively. There
is subsequent loss of excited state emission with the appearance of
excited state transient absorption in all of the cases.53

All other P3HT/PDIs also show strong transient
absorption for the
P3HT cation radical between 750 and 800 nm, whereas the generation
of PDI anion radical was observed at 705 nm (3 ns), 702 nm (3 ns),
and 708 nm (1.77 ns) (lifetime in parentheses) for NO2P-PDI,
DPM-PDI, and PFP-PDI, respectively. Moreover, in all of the cases,
the generation of charge-separated states, i.e., P3HT+• and PDI–•, was observed at a very short
delay time of ∼2 ps and the lifetime of the P3HT singlet excited
state of P3HT at ∼1140 nm was reduced to 163, 167, and 38 ps
for NO2P-PDI, DPM-PDI, and PFP-PDI, respectively (Figure S17). This clearly indicates the electron
transfer from the P3HT excited state to acceptor molecules, resulting
in formation of charge-separated states with long lifetimes as seen
in P3HT/methanofullerene blends.53 The
ultrafast charge transfer from the donor to acceptor favors the efficient
charge carrier generation, and the long lifetime of the charge carriers
reduces the recombination losses in solar cells. In the present study
also, all of the PDIs show the generation of charge-separated states
within few picoseconds with lifetime in nanoseconds.

Overall,
the substituents on imide nitrogen influence the energy
levels of PDI derivatives, and NO2P-PDI and PFP-PDI showed
uplifted LUMO levels, while iPrP-PDI and DPM-PDI
showed uplifted HOMO levels. All of the PDIs showed similar photophysical
and electronic properties. They showed monomeric nature in dilute
solutions and H-type aggregation in the concentrated solution, resulting
in defined structures as observed in SEM images. Ordered self-assembly
of PDI derivatives resulted in good electrical conductivity without
external doping and also showed moderate to high electron mobility.
Finally, TAS clearly supported the efficient charge transfer interactions
between PDI and P3HT polymer with generation of long-lived charge-separated
states.

3 Conclusions
As a
conclusion of the work, we have synthesized four different
perylene diimide derivatives with substitution at the imide position
via a simple synthesis process and studied their photophysical, self-assembling,
and electronic properties. The study of vibronic peak strength for
0–1 and 0–0 transitions clearly suggests least aggregate
formation in DPM-PDI and PFP-PDI, while iPrP-PDI
and NO2P-PDI are more prone to aggregation. The fluorescence
measurement further suggests that although these PDIs form H-type
aggregation, they still emit strongly in solution as well as in films.
These materials also show excellent thermoactivated electron conductivity,
and NO2P-PDI can be used as a temperature sensor. The electron
mobility of the materials was found to be 5–10× higher
than that of PC61BM. These observations indicate optimized
molecular π–π stacking, resulting in strong fluorescence
along with excellent electron transport. The charge-separated transient
species (cation and anion radicals) in P3HT/PDI mixtures were observed
at very short delay time (≤2 ps) with formation of long-lived
charge-separated states. The excellent electrical and optical properties
of these materials make them a potential n-type material for wide
applications in electronic devices.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Characterization
Perylene-3,4,9,10
tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and aromatic amines, i.e., 2,6-diisopropylaniline,
2-nitroaniline, benzhydrylamine, and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroaniline,
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All solvents
were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used after drying. The reaction
was carried out in an anhydrous solvent in oven-dried glassware under
an inert environment of nitrogen. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography
was used to monitor the progress of reaction, and the products were
purified by column chromatography. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy was done on PerkinElmer FTIR Spectrum 2. The sample was
ground with anhydrous KBr, and pallets were prepared to record the
spectrum from 4000 to 500 cm–1. A background in
air was done before recording data for samples. UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy was performed on a Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer
(UV-1800) for solutions and spin-coated films. Products were also
characterized for 1H NMR on a Jeol 400 MHz spectrometer
in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) using tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard. We were not able to record 13C NMR due to low concentration of products in solution. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)-TOF mass spectrometry
AB SCIEX was used to determine the molecular weight of the products
using α-cyano 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix. The three-electrode
standard configuration was used for cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements
using a platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag wire as the reference
electrode, and Pt disc as the working electrode in a 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in o-dichlorobenzene solution as electrolyte. Current vs voltage was
measured on an Autolab potentiostat. Emission fluorescence measurements
were performed on a Varian (CARY eclipse) fluorescence spectrophotometer
in solution and also in films using 450 nm excitation wavelength.
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under 20 mL/min nitrogen
flow using a PerkinElmer (Pyris 1) instrument, and loss in weight
was recorded as a function of temperature. The samples were heated
from room temperature to 700 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min.
A Zeiss EVO-MA10 scanning electron microscope was used to analyze
surface morphology and self-assembling properties of PDI derivatives.
The samples were prepared by spin-coating 0.5 mM solution on cleaned
glass substrates at 1000 rpm followed by annealing at 120 °C.
The electrical conductivities were measured at different temperatures
by the two-probe method using bottom contact patterned ITO, applying
high current source measurement and reading voltage change from a
Keithley multimeter. Electron-only devices were fabricated as described
earlier.46,49,50 Ultrafast
transient absorption spectroscopy was performed using optical pulse
from a Ti:sapphire laser amplifier (35 fs, 4 mJ/pulse, 1 kHz, 800
nm). A beam splitter was used to split the pulse into two beams. An
optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light Conversion) was employed
on the high-intensity beam (pump) to vary the wavelength from 190
to 2600 nm. The weak-intensity beam (probe) was propagated through
a CaF2 crystal to generate white light continuum. A computer-controlled
delay stage was used to optically delay the probe beam with respect
to the pump beam. In the current study, we used 480 nm wavelength
as a pump beam at normal incidence, and the changes in absorption
were detected using a gated CMOS detector. The time-resolved study
was performed using a HELIOS (Ultrafast Systems) spectrometer.
