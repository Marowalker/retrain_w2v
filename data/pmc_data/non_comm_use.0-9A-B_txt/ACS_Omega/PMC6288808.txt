Fluorescent sensors have been synthesized
for organophosphate nerve
agent detection. The resulting 4-pyridyl-5-hydroxyethyl structures
react with organophosphate nerve agent simulants such as diethylchlorophosphate
and diisopropylfluorophosphate and cyclize to form a dihydroquinolizinium
ring that results in an increased fluorescence response to long-wave
UV excitation. These sensors have been functionalized with monomeric
substitutions that allow for covalent incorporation into a polymer
matrix for organophosphate detection to develop a fieldable sensor.
In addition, inclusion of silicon dioxide into the polymer matrix
eliminated false-positive responses from mineral acids, greatly advancing
this class of sensors.

Introduction
For more than 70 years,
organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
have been used as weapons of warfare.1−3 In addition, this class
of compounds are among the most used pesticides.4 Given their extensive general use, and the threat posed
by the continued use of organophosphate warfare agents, studies to
develop methods for the selective detection of these molecules are
warranted and timely.5,6

Recent advances in colorimetric
or fluorescent detection using
chemical-based sensors include rhodamine-based fluorophores,7−10 boron-dipyrromethene dyes,11−15 and other similar strategies for the modifications of reactive and
highly conjugated small-molecule probes.16−18 In some cases,
reactivity-based selectivity has been utilized to differentiate between
the detection of fluoro- or cyanophosphates.19 However, differentiation between common chemicals is difficult and
false positives are a major concern in the practical use of fielded
sensors. To date, none of these technologies have made their way into
the field kits of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
explosives responders.20,21

We have worked to improve
upon the current state-of-the-art through
continued study of the 2-pyridyl-1,2-butenyl-4-ol systems.22,23 It was demonstrated that pyridines appended to a four-carbon side-chain
with a terminal alcohol could be used for the detection of reactive
phosphate esters. Restricted rotation and subsequent planarity was
achieved in the synthesis of the pseudoaromatic metallo-1,2-enedithiolate 1, providing increased spatial probability of intramolecular
coordination of the butanol by the pyridine, resulting in significant
fluorescent and absorbance properties (Figure 1). Subsequent work by Swager and co-workers
in 2003 demonstrated that these were general properties of 2-pyridyl-1,2-butenyl-4-ol
systems such as compounds like 2.24,25 In 2013, a colorimetric assay using 2-pyridyl-1,2-butenyl-4-ol systems
to control complexation with iron(II) was explored.26 These methods are specific for reactive phosphates, phosphinates,
and phosphonates that contain chloro, fluoro, and cyano groups and
allow for rapid detection of these esters both colorimetrically and
fluorometrically at room temperature.

Figure 1 Representative fluorescent sensors. The
pyridyl-1,2-butenyl-4-ol
structure is highlighted in blue.

The following work seeks to implement the above technology
toward
a robust fieldable sensor. Generation of fully organic and affordable
sensors of this class can pave a way toward subsequent immobilization
in a polymer matrix to aid in overcoming problems associated with
the acidic byproducts of organophosphate hydrolysis, as has been shown
in the literature.14,22,27,28

The ethyl-hydroxy group preserves
the highly nucleophilic nature
toward phosphate esters due to its spatial proximity to the intramolecular
pyridine ring. Additionally, a thiazole in conjugation to the pyridine
ring is suspected to improve its basicity through resonance stabilization
of the protonated form by 2–3 pKa units, resulting in greater
reactivity.29 Following phosphorylation,
the activated phosphate ester is proposed to act as a leaving group
for dihydropyrolidinium ring closure as illustrated in Scheme 1. Once the dihydroquinolizinium
ring structure is formed, a higher fluorescence yield is observed
as a result of increased π overlap and forced planarity of the
A, B, and C rings. These improvements bring increased pertinence of
this strategy in organophosphate detection.

for Structures with Increased Fluorescence after
Exposure to Organophosphates
Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Thiazole Dyes
Thiazole
dyes 5a–g can be synthesized from
3-bromo-4-oxo-4-(pyridin-2-yl)butyl
acetate, 3, and a thioamide as demonstrated in Scheme 2. Cyclization with
4-aryl-thioamides or thiourea gave the target thiazoles in modest
yields. After the thiazole formation, facile saponification yields
the product in five synthetic steps with an overall yield of 19–38%.
In addition to p-substituted phenyl substituents at the thiazole C-2
position, a dimer molecule was made using 1,4-naphthalenedicarbothioamide,
and following the same synthetic scheme 6e was synthesized.
Thiazole 4a was acylated with acrylic acid to provide
the monomer 4f. An additional monomer unit was prepared
via a heck coupling of 4d with ethylene to provide styrene 4g.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route to Thiazole Sensors
The practical utility of organophosphate sensors
can be realized
by their incorporation into polymer films, which are generated using
acryloyl or styryl substituents for radical-initiated polymerization
with styrene. Two of such monomers have been synthesized as shown
in Scheme 3. Amino-acid
coupling with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
was achieved using acrylic acid to produce the acrylamide 5b.32 The phenyl bromide 5f is converted to the styryl thiazole 5g after reaction
with ethylene using Heck conditions.33

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Thiazole Monomers
Co-polymers afforded from these monomers limits may provide
increased
resistance of the sensor to acids and provides precedent for future
incorporation into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance
phosphate ester selectivity.34 It also
allows co-polymerization with additional monomers containing basic
functional groups, such as (diisopropylamino)ethyl-methacrylate (DPAEMA).
This not only may negate the deleterious effects of the acids in phosphate
sensing but also allows for a direct route to preparation of the MIP.

Fluorescent Properties of Thiazole Dyes
Fluorescence
emission was expected to increase dramatically after cyclization of
the dihydroquinolizinium ring, the results of which for dyes 5a–5g and 6a–6g are summarized in Table 1. For most dyes, the maximum excitation wavelength
provided by emission scans was near 350 nm; however, that wavelength
cannot be used for emission in testing due to native emission interference
by organophosphoryl halides, such as diethylchlorophosphate (DECP)
and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), at excitation wavelengths of
less than 375 nm. At an excitation wavelength of 395 nm, DECP and
DFP have no fluorescence emission and a significant emission response
from the sensors remained apparent; therefore, 395 nm was chosen for
dye comparison throughout the experiment. Another advantage of choosing
an excitation wavelength above 375 nm is that the precursor alcohols
absorb very little light at those wavelengths, resulting in a much
reduced emissive response for those starting materials and their HCl
or HF salts. Synthesis of the dihydroquinolizinium derivatives 6a–6h using thionyl chloride provided
purified reference standards for each compound that were characterized
alongside their precursor alcohols (Table 1).

a Recorded in chloroform at 395 nm.

b Obtained in ethanol at λexit = 355 nm, relative
to 9,10-diphenylanthracene.

Calculation of fluorescent quantum efficiencies in comparison to
9,10-diphenylanthracene as a standard30 revealed trends among the thiazole dyes tested. For the 2-amino-thiazole 5a, the quantum efficiency did not change dramatically as
expected. The rise in fluorescence emission at λexit = 395 nm is a direct result of greater absorbance by the fluorophore 6a at longer wavelengths. For the bis-naphthalene compound 1e, cyclization significantly reduced the quantum yield. For
thiazoles 5b–5d, the opposite effect
is observed where quantum efficiency is significantly increased after
cyclization. The 4-halogen-substituted 2-phenylthiazoles exhibited
lower quantum efficiencies in comparison to the 2-phenylthiazole 5b.

The π-systems of the thiazole and pyridine
rings are forced
in the same plane upon cyclization, resulting in a maximum absorbance
at a longer wavelength for all dyes. As a result, excitation at a
wavelength of 395 nm provides an increase in fluorescence emission
intensity, as shown in Figure 2. Quantum efficiencies were obtained for all dihydroquinolizinium
derivatives and their respective alcohols. Although quantum efficiencies
typically decreased after cyclization, the increase in the absorbance
at longer wavelengths provided a striking difference in fluorescence
intensity for the 395 nm excitation wavelength and for the 365 nm
excitation wavelength typical of a longwave UV blacklight.

Fluorescence observed for λexit = 395.

The increase in π-conjugation was expected
to enhance quantum
efficiency, so the opposite observation for 5e and 6e was surprising. A possible explanation is that steric effects
cause the 2-phenyl or 2-napthyl structures to be out of the plane
of the thiazole π-system. Molecular mechanics calculations have
been used to predict rotational barriers in fluorescence applications,35,36 and simple calculations revealed higher conformational energies
for structures where the torsion angle between the two rings was fixed
at 0 or 180°. Shown in Table 2, the molecular mechanics derived energy difference
between structures with planar constraints and those that are out-of-plane
is greater for the bis-thiazole-naphthalene compound 6e in comparison to the 2-phenyl thiazole structure 6b. Although this is a likely explanation, other factors should be
considered as well, such as self-quenching or different excitation
states that come into play upon cyclization. 5e was not
chosen for further study due to the impracticality of a “turn-off”
sensor in comparison to the “turn-on” sensors 5a and 5b.

The newly synthesized thiazole dyes 5a–5e react with organophosphoryl halides, such
as organophosphate
nerve agent simulants DECP or DFP, as expected. The formation of 6a and 6b and subsequent increase in fluorescence
emission was examined through the use of DECP in solution phase studies.
As a control, hydrochloric acid was also added in the same concentration
to show the relative sensitivity to mineral acid. Protonation of 1a by HCl results in comparable increase in fluorescence response
to DECP after excitation at 365 nm as shown in Figures 3 and 4. At 395 nm
excitation, a difference between DECP and HCl is visible due to the
increased absorbance of the cyclized product 6a at longer
wavelengths (Supporting Information (SI) Figure 1). The effect of HCl sensitivity is much reduced for 5b. For practical use in solution phase, 5b is
a better sensor at 365 nm excitation not only due to greater fluorescence
yield upon cyclization but also due to its relative improved contrast
of DECP response when compared to the same amount of HCl.

10–4 M). Left: full emission scans from T = 0 to 120 min at λexit = 395 nm. Right:
emission curve at λmax = 515 nm.

Cyclization was further examined through an increase in fluorescent
response over time. In a similar fashion to previous experiments,
excess organophosphate was allowed to react with 5a in
a solution over a period of 2 h. The fluorescence response at λex = 395 nm was examined at various time points. Within a few
minutes, the presence of organophosphate is evident; however, for
complete cyclization to occur, incubation of 5a with
DECP must be allowed to take >2 h as shown from the solution phase
fluorimetry emission experiments. The data support that the reaction
is pseudo-first order in nature.

Perhaps a more useful examination
of the utility of 5a and 1c is through the
determination of the limit of
detection against organophosphates. Two hours of incubation of 5a and 5b was allowed for varying concentrations
of DECP, and their fluorescence emission was examined at λexit = 395 nm. Both dyes exhibit a minimum limit of detection
at 1 × 10–4 M for a dye concentration of 1
× 10–4 M; roughly 1 equiv of DECP. For 5 equiv
DECP, or 1 × 10–4 M DECP, the fluorescence
intensity reaches a large jump in intensity. At lower concentrations
of the dye, fluorescence intensity begins to have diminishing returns
at 1 equiv of organophosphoryl chloride, as a result of slow reaction
times and reduced total fluorescence (SI Figure 2).

Synthesis and Characterization of Polystyrene
Film Sensors
It remains a concern that mineral acids caused
false positives
with these sensors in the solution phase. Therefore, the incorporation
of the thiazole dyes into polymer films was sought with the hopes
that immobilization would deter acid vapor mixing, as well as provide
an opportunity for an acid scavenger to be present for increased sensitivity
for electrophiles. Previously, organophosphate sensors have been distributed
in triethylcitrate/cellulose acetate or RTV118 silicon films that
were not optimized to reduce acid sensitivity.22,25 However, the incorporation of covalently bonded sensors as part
of a polystyrene matrix was a focus of this work.

Two monomers
were synthesized for incorporation into a polystyrene film, as shown
in Scheme 3. Polymers
were made using freshly purified styrene, monomers 5f or 5g, and catalytic azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).
To address the acid problem, varying percentages of DPAEMA were added.
As a technique for solution phase sensing, a filter paper was coated
with 2 mL of a 20% polymer (w/v) in either chloroform or toluene.
Once dried, the coated filter paper was cut into 16 mm diameter circles
using a hole punch, and analytes were added to test organophosphoryl
halide and organophosphate pesticide detection (SI Figure 3). The DPAEMA-incorporated polymers did not differentiate
from false positives as expected. It was not intuitive that HCl would
be visible in all concentrations of basic monomer tested, and despite
that, incorporation of the basic monomer proved unhelpful as sensitivity
to DECP was decreased in films with higher concentrations (SI Figure 4). These results led to the abandonment
of using DPAEMA as a strategy to solve the acid sensitivity issue.

To buffer acid response without the use of an incorporated organic
base, silica gel was added to the diluted polymer solution before
coating the filter paper to ensure a uniform dispersal as has been
shown in other films with CsCO3.28,37 It was found that silica gel was effective at eliminating the response
of the polymer to acid at 1 M concentrations, yet retained the response
to DECP and even increased the fluorescence yield of DFP sensing.
These results are summarized in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Emission spectra at λexit = 395 nm for
SiO2 dispersed 0.1% 5f polystyrene polymer
coated
on filter paper with DECP, DFP, and HCl (1 M). Overlaid is the longwave
UV fluorescence response at 365 nm to organophosphate exposure and
1 N HCl in methanol on silica-gel-infused filter paper test circles.

To examine vapor-phase organophosphate
sensing, the 0.1% 5f in styrene polymer was spread over
a quartz slide and allowed
to incubate in a 20 mL sealed vial that contained 1 μL DECP
at room temperature. The quartz slide was fitted in a fluorimetry
cuvette and examined for fluorescence emission at 395 nm at 5 and
10 min time points (SI Figure 5). In similar
fashion, the polymer-dispersed filter paper circles were also exposed
to DECP and DFP vapors, providing a positive response.

Conclusions
These results demonstrate a more practical use of 2-pyridyl-1,2-butenyl-4-ol
organophosphate sensors than in solution phase. Alleviating acid contamination
through the use of dispersed silicon dioxide is a step toward making
a robust device that could be used in a variety of applications. The
ability to use the sensors as polymer films provides a versatile solvent-free
platform for both vapor phase and direct drop-testing of unknown samples
on a test strip to screen for organophosphoryl halide contamination.
Further optimization of the polymers, such as use in a MIP, may allow
for further differentiation between compounds of interest.

Experimental
Section
Materials and General Methods
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III-HD 400
MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA). 13C NMR spectra
were obtained at 100 MHz using a proton-decoupled pulse sequence and
are tabulated by observed peak. CDCl3 (Oakwood Chemical,
Estill, SC) or CD3OD (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were
used as NMR solvents. Chemical shifts (δ) were reported in parts
per million with the residual solvent peak used as an internal standard,
δ 1H/13C (solvent): 7.26/77.00 (CDCl3); 3.30/49.00 (CD3OD); and are tabulated as follows:
chemical shift, multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet;
m, multiplet; q, quartet), coupling constants, J,
are reported in hertz (Hz), and number of protons. High-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectra were obtained on a LCQ Orbitrap
Velos (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). UV–vis spectra
were recorded at room temperature on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Solution phase emission
and excitation spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Spex
FluoroMax-2 Spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific, Edison, NJ). Solid-phase
emission and excitation spectra were obtained at room temperature
using an Infinite M1000 microplate reader (Tecan, Morrisville, NC)
using 24-well corning cell culture plates painted with black with
matte low-reflectance camouflage spray paint. Thin-layer chromatography
was performed on ready-to-use glass-backed silica gel 60 plates (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). Flash column chromatography was performed over Acros
silica gel (40–60 μm, 200–400 mesh). All the reactions
were performed under an inert atmosphere of either Zero-grade nitrogen
or argon (Airgas, Radnor, PA). All the chemicals were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA),
or Oakwood Chemicals (Estill, SC) and used without further purification.

Synthesis of Compounds 1a–g–6a–g
1-(2-Pyridyl)-2-bromo-4-acetoxybutan-1-one 3 was prepared according to the literature procedure.22 Further details and spectral data for the synthesis
of these analogues and their synthetic intermediates are provided
in the Supporting Information.

General Procedure
for the Polymerization of Polystyrene Films
To benzene (5
mL) in a 30 mL vial fitted with a stir bar was added
2 mL styrene that had been passed through a column of inhibitor remover
resin. To this was added monomers 4a or 4e with 0, 1, 5, or 10% v/v (diisopropylamino)ethyl-methacrylate (DPAEMA).
Finally, a catalytic amount of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was added.
The filled vial was fitted to a Schlenk manifold and placed under
an atmosphere of argon. The reaction mixture was cooled in liquid
nitrogen, evacuated with vacuum and warmed under static vacuum to
degas the solution. This freeze–pump–thaw process was
completed twice more before the vial was sealed under gentle heating
of the neck with a propane torch under static vacuum. The sealed vial
was stirred and heated to 75 °C for 16 h. After this time, polymerization
was complete and the film cast and dried.

Analysis of Solution Phase
Fluorimetry Response of Thiazole
Dyes to Organophosphates
Thiazoles 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, and 5e were
analyzed for their fluorescence emission after incubation with organophosphate
nerve agent simulants diethylchlorophosphate (DECP) or diisopropylfluorophosphate
(DFP). The dyes were dissolved in either methanol or chloroform to
a final concentration of 1 × 10–6 or 1 ×
10–7 M, respectively. Three milliliters of diluted
solution was pipetted into a 1.0 × 1.0 cm2 quartz
fluorimetry cell with clear walls on all four sides, capped, and the
cuvette was placed into the Fluoromax-2 spectrophotometer and the
door fully sealed. Analysis was performed at either 355 or 395 nm
excitation wavelengths, and the emission spectra were scanned from
410 to 650 nm at a rate of 5 scans per second. The spectral bandpass
was set to 5 nm for both the excitation and emission. A desired amount
of simulant is added directly to the cuvette for additional testing,
and a stir bar is fitted to the cuvette for facile mixing on an external
magnetic stir plate. The polymer films were analyzed for their base
and postexposure response by coating a small flat quartz insert with
polystyrene films by drop-casting using a concentrated suspension
of polymer in chloroform. The insert was placed at a 45° angle
to the excitation beam, allowing for the detection of the fluorescence
emission by the detector.

Production of Polymer Film-Coated Filter
Paper Test Strips and
Testing
Polystyrene films were concentrated to dryness in
vacuo and suspended in chloroform (5 mL/g). Silica gel, alumina, or
fumed silica was suspended into the solution (50 mg/2 mL). The films
were coated onto 85 mm diameter qualitative fast-flow filter paper
(2 mL solution) and allowed to dry. For uniformity, a 16 mm diameter
circular hole-punch was used to cut out circular filter paper samples.
These test circles were exposed to analytes directly. For complete
coating, at least 40 μL was used to produce a uniform fluorescent
response. Once dried, the test circles were placed into the bottom
of a well in a matte black-painted 24-well microplate and analyzed
for their fluorescent response at λexit = 395 using
a microplate reader. Analysis was performed at either 355 or 395 nm
excitation wavelengths, and the emission spectra were scanned from
365 to 750 or 410 to 750 nm, with a scan frequency of every 2 nm.
The excitation band width was set to 5 nm. Gain was optimized for
the well that contained the highest expected fluorescence to be analyzed.

Calculation of Quantum Yields
Quantum yields in ethanol
were calculated from a standard curve for samples at concentrations
of 0.2 × 10–5, 0.4 × 10–5, 0.6 × 10–5, 0.8 × 10–5, and 1.0 × 10–5 M for 5a, 6a, 5b, 5c, and 5d,
and 0.2 × 10–6, 0.4 × 10–6, 0.6 × 10–6, 0.8 × 10–6, and 1.0 × 10–6 M for 6b, 6c, 6d, 5e and 6e,
respectively. A volume of 200 μL was placed in each respective
well in a 96-well clear or black polystyrene flat-bottom microplate
(Corning, Tewksbury, MA). Both the absorbance at 355 nm and the total
integrated fluorescence at λexit = 355 were plotted
for each compound. Using the literature quantum efficiency value of
0.95 for 9,10-diphenylanthracene in ethanol,30 the resulting slopes from fluorescence over absorbance were compared
to that generated for the fluorescence standard at concentrations
of 0.2 × 10–7, 0.4 × 10–7, 0.6 × 10–7, 0.8 × 10–7, and 1.0 × 10–7 M. Total integrated fluorescence
was calculated using the following formula for integration of a manual
plot: , where a = 365 nm, b = 749 nm, and N = 192.

Computational Details
Molecular mechanics (MMFF94)
calculations31 were performed using Spartan’16
V2.07 (Wavefunction, Irvine, CA). Conformational structures for 5b, 5e, 6b, and 6e were
minimized using this function and associated energies calculated and
recorded for the minimum-energy conformation. For these structures,
the torsion angle was examined between C2 of the thiazole ring and
the phenyl ring of 5b and 6b or napthyl
ring of 5e and 6e, respectively (Table 2). The calculations
were repeated for each structure after constraining this torsion angle
at 0 or 180°, and the respective energies are tabulated for comparison.
