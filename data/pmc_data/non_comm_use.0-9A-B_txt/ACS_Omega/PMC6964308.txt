The structure evolution and deformation behavior of tenter-frame
biaxially oriented polyethylene (TF-BOPE) films were investigated
in this study. For sequential biaxial stretching, the original spherulites
were broken into small pieces, and the fibrillar structure simultaneously
formed during the machine direction (MD) stretching. Subsequently,
the single fibrils were pulled away, and some fine fibrils developed
via partial melting–recrystallization or lamellar rearrangement
during the transverse direction (TD) stretching, which leads to the
formation of the vein structure and nanosized fiber-like network.
For simultaneous biaxial stretching, the fractured lamellae and the
newly formed crystals were evenly distributed in the MD-TD plane like
an isotropous fibrillar network. Moreover, compared with the unstretched
sample, both films could achieve up to about 2 times the tensile modulus
and 4.5 times the tensile strength and also exhibited the superior
optical property.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Tenter-frame biaxial stretching
is an innovative technology for
polyethylene (PE) films, where the cast sheet is drawn in two vertical
directions with a single procedure (simultaneous biaxial stretching)
or two subsequent procedures (sequential biaxial stretching).1 Compared with the traditional blown film, the
tenter-frame biaxially oriented polyethylene (TF-BOPE) film can achieve
up to twice the tensile modulus, thrice the tensile strength, twice
the impact strength, thrice the puncture, and 80% less haze (www.dow.com). Moreover, the TF-BOPE
film has great toughness and flex cracking resistance even under low
temperature, so it is especially suitable for the frozen food packaging.2−4

The biaxially oriented films have been widely investigated,
and
the structure evolution can be classified in two types in terms of
the crystallization capacity. On the one hand, some polymers are easy
to crystallize with the cast sheet in a semi-crystalline state, such
as polypropylene (PP), which is biaxially drawn at a temperature near
the melting point (Tm). The spherulitic
morphology of the PP film turns into the stacked lamellae via melting
in the machine direction (MD, the first tensile direction in sequential
biaxial stretching) and then forms a fibrillar network through the
crystallographic slip in the transverse direction (TD, the second
tensile direction in sequential biaxial stretching, perpendicular
to MD).5,6 Moreover, a visualized microstructure of
the nanometer-scale fibrillar network for the BOPP film is observed
by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the morphology can be controlled
by selecting an appropriate biaxial draw ratio.7

On the other hand, other polymers, such as poly(ethylene
terephthalate)
(PET), polylactic acid (PLA), and polystyrene (PS), can be quenched
into a quasi-amorphous state through a chill roll, which are biaxially
drawn in a rubbery state (above the Tg). The model of the structure evolution during sequential biaxial
stretching is proposed, and it is determined by the development of
the crystal structure in the MD stretching.8,9 Simultaneously,
the second population of oriented but poorly ordered crystals develops
along TD.10 The relaxation behavior of
the biaxially stretched PET films is divided into three regimes according
to the relationship between birefringence and strain, which is directly
in contact with the development of strain-induced crystallization
at different biaxial ratios.11−13

There are many investigations
regarding the uniaxial deformation
of PE,14−22 whereas research about structure evolution for the TF-BOPE film
is scanty.23−25 Indeed, biaxial stretching is a very important processing
method for the fabrication of PE films in industry, but the microstructure
evolution during TD stretching is still unclear.

In this work,
we studied the processes of sequential biaxial stretching
in detail and also studied the processes of simultaneous biaxial stretching
as a comparison. The results show that the structure evolution for
the two processes is conspicuously different and the simultaneously
biaxially stretched film exhibited a more uniform lamellae distribution
in the MD-TD plane than the sequentially biaxially stretched film.
Moreover, after biaxial stretching, both films show superior mechanical
and optical performance. In addition, the investigation may also provide
a guide for choosing the optimal manufacture window and controlling
the microstructure in industry.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Sample Preparation
The linear low-density polyethylene used in this study was kindly
offered by Guangdong Decro Film New Materials Co., Ltd., with a melt
flow rate (MFR) of 1.8 g/10 min (190 °C, 2.16 kg). The number-average
molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) were 24,900 and
116,500 g/mol, respectively. The resin pellets were molded into the
1 mm-thick sheet (190 °C, 15 MPa) and then quenched into water
at room temperature.

2.2 Film Stretching
The TF-BOPE film
was prepared on a biaxial stretcher (KARO IV, Brückner, Germany).
The square sample (90 mm × 90 mm) was cut from the compression
sheet. After being preheated in the first chamber (114 °C) for
2 min, the samples for sequential biaxial stretching and simultaneous
biaxial stretching were employed with the stretching rate of 0.25
s–1 at 114 °C. Then, the film was moved to
the second chamber (100 °C), setting for 2 min. As shown in Figure S1a, the film of sequential biaxial stretching
was first stretched in MD with the draw ratio of 6 and constrained
at the same time in TD. Subsequently, the different draw ratios of
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in TD were chosen, which were labeled PE-6×1,
PE-6×2, PE-6×3, PE-6×4, PE-6×5, and PE-6×6,
respectively. Moreover, the simultaneously biaxially stretched film
with the draw ratio of 6 × 6 and the original sheet were called
PE-sim-6×6 and PE-0, respectively.

2.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
To get visual crystal morphology, the sample was chemically etched
by a potassium permanganate solution.26,27 The morphology
was gained by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
S4700, Hitachi, Japan).

2.4 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
The
surface morphologies of the film were investigated on the Asylum Research
atomic force microscope (Cypher VRS, Oxford, England) in the tapping
mode. The needle type of AC240TS was used in this study with the resonance
frequency of 45–95 kHz and the spring constant of 0.3–4.8
N/m. The image of a 3 μm square was gained at the scan rate
of 2.44 Hz.

2.5 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
Thermal analysis was carried out with the DSC 3+ STARe System (Mettler
Toledo, Switzerland). Heat flow and temperature scales were calibrated
using the high-purity indium and zinc. A nominal 5 mg of sample was
heated from 25 to 170 °C at the heating rate of 10 °C/min
under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL/min). Furthermore, the crystallinity
(XDSC) is computed according to the following
equation 1  where ΔHm is the melting enthalpy, and ΔHm0 is the melting
enthalpy of 100% crystalline PE (287.3 J/g).28 Moreover, the distribution of short-chain branching (SCB) for the
ethylene/α-olefin copolymer was tested by the method of successive
self-nucleation and annealing (SSA) fractionation, and the thermal
procedures are shown in Figure S2a.29,30

2.6 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The biaxial orientation of the PE film was measured by the FTIR
spectrometer (Nicolet 560, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with the
resolution of 2 cm–1 and accumulation of 64 scans
in transmission mode.31 The polarization
of the beam was performed using a zinc selenide wire grid polarizer.
The sample was placed perpendicular to the FTIR beam with MD in the
vertical direction and TD in the horizontal direction. Then, the measurements
were performed with the polarization beam in the positions of 0°
and 90°, respectively.24

The
White–Spruiell biaxial orientation factors (fseg, MDB), which can quantify the orientation of interesting segments in
MD and TD, are defined according to 2   3  where “seg”
is the a, b, or c axis of the orthorhombic crystal structure for PE. In addition,
the θ1 and θ2 are defined in terms
of the angles between the crystallographic axis and MD/TD of the biaxially
stretched film. The values of f are limited, with f = 1 for perfect orientation, f = 0 for
random orientation, and f = −1 for complete
perpendicular orientation. The details for this method can be found
elsewhere.32,33

2.7 Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD)
The measurement of crystal structure and orientation was carried
out using a wide-angle X-ray diffractometer (WAXD, D8 Discover, Bruker,
Germany) with Cu Kα X-ray radiation (λ = 0.154 nm).34 The films were stacked to ∼0.5 mm, and
their two-dimensional WAXD (2D-WAXD) patterns were gained by placing
the sample surface perpendicular to the projection beams with the
exposure time for 3 min. One-dimensional WAXD (1D-WAXD) data could
be obtained by integrating 2D-WAXD patterns as a function of 2θ.
The crystallinity (XXRD) is defined as
follows 4  where Aa and Ac are the fitted areas of
amorphous and crystalline regions, respectively. Moreover, the crystallite
size (L) of the various planes for PE was calculated
from Debye–Scherrer’s equation 5  where λ is the wavelength
of X-ray, β is the full width of the diffraction line at half
maximum, and θ is the Bragg angle.

2.8 Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
The SAXS experiment was conducted on the Xeuss 2.0 system (Xenocs,
France) equipped with a multilayer focused Cu Kα X-ray source
(λ = 0.154 nm). The sample-to-detector distance was fixed at
2500 mm, which provided the effective scattering vector q (q = (4π sin θ)/λ)) range from
0.05 to 1.15 nm–1. The long period of the lamellae
(Lp) was determined from Bragg’s
law35 6  where qmax is the maximum scattering vector of the relevant intensity
profile. The lamellar thicknesses (Lc)
and amorphous thicknesses (La) are computed
in terms of the following equations 7   8   9  where ρc (1.003
g/cm3), ρa (0.855 g/cm3), and
ρ are the densities of the PE crystalline phase, PE amorphous
phase, and tested sample, respectively.36 Moreover, it should be noted that the equations assume a much larger
lateral extent of the crystalline lamellae as compared with thickness.

2.9 Ultraviolet–Visible Spectroscopy (UV–Vis)
The luminous transmittance (T) of the PE film
(∼30 μm in thickness) was measured by a UV–Vis
spectrometer (UV 1800, Shimadzu, Japan) with the wavelength range
from 400 to 800 nm.

2.10 Mechanical Testing
The biaxially
stretched film was tailored into the rectangles (60 mm × 10 mm)
along MD, TD, and diagonal direction (DD, angled 45° from MD),
respectively, as shown in Figure S1b. The
above samples were conducted on a universal tensile testing machine
(Instron, USA) with the crosshead speed of 20 mm/min at 23 °C,
and each experiment was repeated five times.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Biaxial Stress–Strain Behavior
The stress–strain curves of sequential and simultaneous biaxial
stretching are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. In the first step of sequential biaxial
stretching, the sheet was drawn along MD to an objective draw ratio
of 6, where both curves of MD and TD exhibited a yielding behavior
due to localized necking. Moreover, the tensile strength in MD was
about twice larger than that in TD. Strain hardening appeared at a
high draw ratio for the MD curve, which meant that some fibrillar
structure developed during the first stretching. In the second step
of sequential biaxial stretching, a continual decrease in stress in
the MD curve was observed, which was because the original crystals
along MD gradually turned toward TD. In the simultaneous biaxial stretching,
the typical stress–strain behavior (yielding, strain softening,
and strain hardening) of both directions was observed, which suggested
that the original spherulites in the sheet were destroyed by biaxial
load and then transformed into fibrils oriented along MD or TD.

curves of (a) sequential biaxial stretching30 and (b) simultaneous biaxial stretching.

3.2 Morphology Evolution during Biaxial Stretching
The morphology evolution of PE films during biaxial stretching
is investigated by AFM, as shown in Figure 2. For the sample of PE-0, the isotropous
lamellar structure was found in the phase image. After the MD stretching,
there are plenty of crystals oriented along MD in the sample of PE-6×1.
To characterize more detailed morphology for the samples of PE-0 and
PE-6×1, SEM images are also obtained after selective etching
shown in Figure S3. An isotropous spherulite
structure and random lamellae were observed in the sheet of PE-0.
Sequentially, lamellae were broken into small pieces and were well
arranged along MD. Moreover, the above lamellar fragments were incorporated
into the fibrillar structure, which looked like a string of pearls.
It was worth mentioning that the SEM images of other samples were
not obtained because the films (25 to 50 μm in thickness) were
too thin to be etched.

Figure 2 AFM height and phase images (3 μm × 3 μm)
of the
sequentially biaxially stretched films prepared at various transverse
draw ratios and the PE-sim-6×6 film. The vertical and horizontal
arrows indicate MD and TD, respectively.

During the TD stretching, a separation of compact
and well-arranged
fibrils took place in the sample of PE-6×2, where some single
fibrils were pulled away from fibrillar bundles and were slightly
inclined against MD. The above morphology with the larger fibrillar
bundles along MD and the divided individual fibrils against MD looked
like a leaf vein and was called a vein structure in the following.
From the topographic image of PE-6×3, a newly emerged structure
of the nanosized fiber-like network was also observed. Also, more
single fibrils were split from the vein structure, and some fine fibrils,
developed by the partial melting–recrystallization or lamellar
rearrangement, were highly aligned parallel to TD. With the increase
in λTD from 4 to 6, the diameter of the fibrillar
bundle became substantially smaller, and then the divided single fibrils
rotated to TD by the transverse loading forces. Although some vein
structures were not susceptible to the transverse stretching and were
still parallel to MD, the majority of fibrils gradually oriented toward
TD. We could conclude that the general fibrillar distribution progressively
reoriented from MD to TD under the combined effects of crystal rotation
and melting–recrystallization. On the other hand, the morphology
of PE-sim-6×6 had some significant differences compared to that
of PE-6×6, which displayed a uniform and nanosized network structure
without the vein structure along MD. Moreover, the orientation of
fibrils in the sample of PE-sim-6×6 was isotropous in the film
plane, not like the fibrillar distribution of PE-6×6 either in
MD or TD.

3.3 Thermal Analyses
The thermograms
of sequentially and simultaneously biaxially stretched films are exhibited
in Figure 3a. We could
find that all the melting curves showed multiple-melting behavior
after drawing. For the sample of PE-0, there was the central peak
at 127.9 °C, the shoulder peak at 123.5 °C, and the shoulder
peak at 104.7 °C, which suggested that three kinds of lamellae
with different thickness values coexisted in the PE sheet in terms
of the Thomson–Gibbs equation.37 Moreover, the formation of the shoulder peak at 123.5 °C was
due to the quenching process. After stretching, the shoulder peak
at 104.7 °C began to fade. As shown in Figure S2b, there are some peaks at low temperature, implying that
the SCB distribution is heterogeneous.

Figure 3 (a) Melting curves, (b)
corresponding crystallinity (XDSC), and
(c) Xright of the
sequentially biaxially stretched films prepared at various transverse
draw ratios and the PE-sim-6×6 film.

The corresponding crystallinity of different samples
is exhibited
in Figure 3b, where
the XDSC gradually increases until the
biaxial draw ratio of 6 × 4 and then decreases for the biaxial
draw ratios of 6 × 5 and 6 × 6. The change in XDSC might ascribe to the coupling effects of the recrystallization
for amorphous chains and the destruction for original lamellae. Moreover,
the crystallinity of PE-sim-6×6 was slightly larger than that
of PE-6×6. To investigate the proportion of thick lamellae (127.9
°C), we separated all melting endotherms into the left and right
areas along the dotted line at 125 °C and then calculated the
crystallinity of the right peak at 127.7 °C (Xright) shown in Figure 3c. The Xright gradually
reduced with the increase in λTD, suggesting that
the thick lamellae were continuously destroyed by the transverse stress.
Therefore, we could conclude that, during the TD stretching, the destruction
of thick lamellae (127.9 °C) and the recrystallization occurred
at the same time. Moreover, before the biaxial ratio of 6 × 4,
the rate of recrystallization was higher than that of destruction,
leading to the increase in crystallinity. When most of the amorphous
molecules regularly folded into crystals, the process of crystalline
elimination dominated during stretching and the crystallinity decreased
at the biaxial ratios of 6 × 5 and 6 × 6.

3.4 Microstructure and Crystallinity
As displayed in Figure 4a, the (110) and (200) peaks of the 1D-WAXD profiles gradually move
to a smaller scattering angle during the TD stretching. Moreover,
the crystalline structure parameters (2θ), interplanar spacing
(d-spacing), and crystallite size (L) are computed and listed in Table S1.
The d-spacing increased and L decreased
with the increase in λTD, indicating the extension
of the crystal plane parallel to the chain axis and the reduction
of the lamella in the direction perpendicular to the (110) and (200)
planes. Besides, more lamellae gradually oriented to TD, which might
develop due to effects of crystal rotation and recrystallization.
As shown in Figure 4b, XXRD rises sharply at first before
λTD reaches 4 and then declines for λTD = 5 and 6, which is similar to the trend of the crystallinity change
from DSC.

sequentially biaxially stretched films prepared at various transverse
draw ratios and the PE-sim-6×6 film.

3.5 Orientation Structure
The successive
2D-WAXD patterns of different samples are shown in Figure 5a, where the equator and meridian
are defined as the horizontal direction (MD) and vertical direction
(TD), respectively. The diffraction rings of the (110) and (200) lattice
planes were observed in the sample of PE-0 and then transformed into
two pairs of concentrated and bright diffractions in the horizontal
direction after the first step of stretching, implying the formation
of the fibrillar structure and well-stacked lamellae along MD.38 Subsequently, the diffraction signal of PE-6×1
transformed from the meridian to the equator during the second step
of stretching.

Figure 5 (a) 2D-WAXD patterns and (b) corresponding azimuthal intensity
curves of the (110) lattice plane of the sequentially biaxially stretched
films prepared at various transverse draw ratios and the PE-sim-6×6
film. The horizontal and vertical arrows indicate MD and TD, respectively.

The corresponding azimuthal intensity curves of
the (110) lattice
plane are also shown in Figure 5b, where the azimuthal angles of 0° (180°) and 90°
(270°) are defined as the meridian and equator directions, respectively.
For the sample of PE-6×1, two sharp peaks in the azimuthal intensity
curve were found at 0° and 180°, and the crystals were highly
oriented along MD. During the TD stretching, two weak peaks appeared
in the azimuthal angles of 90° and 270°, and meanwhile,
the intense peaks of 0° and 180° were still located at the
meridian direction for the samples of PE-6×2 and PE-6×3,
which indicated that another population of crystals was parallel to
TD. When the sheet was stretched to the biaxial draw ratio of 6 ×
4, the multiple peaks of 0° (180°) and 90° (270°)
simultaneously appeared, and their intensity was almost same, indicating
that the crystal orientation toward MD and TD reached a state of equilibrium.
As the λTD increased to 5 and 6, the main peaks were
situated at 90° and 270° and the general crystal orientation
shifted from MD to TD. In addition, azimuthal intensity curves of
PE-sim-6×6 showed no distinct peaks because of isotropic crystal
distribution.

To describe the crystal orientation in more detail,
White–Spruiell
biaxial orientation characterized by FTIR was also used in this study.
The triangular diagram and the values of White-Spruiell biaxial orientation
factors for different samples are shown in Figure 6a and Table 1, respectively. It is worth mentioning that all the
orientation points (fMDB and fTDB) lie within the isosceles triangle,
with the origin (0, 0) representing isotropic orientation, point (0.5,
0.5) representing equal planar orientation in the MD-TD plane, and
point (−1, −1) representing the perpendicular orientation
to the film surface shown in Figure S4.31

biaxially stretched films prepared at various transverse draw ratios

The unstretched sheet exhibited the characteristic
of isotropic
lamellae arrangement (f = 0). For the sample of PE-6×1,
the crystallographic c-axis was preferably oriented
along the uniaxial planar-machine direction, while both the crystallographic a-axis and b-axis took a position close
to the TD-ND plane (ND, perpendicular to the MD-TD plane). Simplified
schematics are shown in Figure 6b with four different orientation states (I, II, III, and
IV), where the crystallographic c-axis is the direction
of molecular chain folding, b-axis is the direction
of lamellar growth, and a-axis is the direction of
lamellar stacking. Hence, it was clear that the crystal orientation
of PE-6×1 was in the states of schematics I and II with an approximately
equal proportion. With the increase in transverse ratio for sequential
biaxial films, fc, MDB decreased and fc, TDB increased simultaneously. Subsequently, the
crystallographic c-axis approached a state of equal
biaxial orientation in the MD-TD plane at about the ratio of 6 ×
3 and then gradually oriented toward TD at a higher draw ratio. Also,
the orientation factors of the crystallographic a-axis (fa, MDB and fa, TDB) were
stably negative, which suggested that the crystallographic a-axis was partly perpendicular to the film surface. As
for the crystallographic b-axis, the fb, MDB and fb, TDB progressively
moved to the point of (0, 0) and reached equilibrium at the ratio
of 6 × 4, implying the isotropic distribution of the crystallographic b-axis. Besides, the biaxial orientation factors of the
crystallographic a-axis, b-axis,
and c-axis for PE-sim-6×6 were all suited at
the diagonal, stating an equal biaxial orientation in MD and TD after
simultaneous biaxial stretching.

From the above analyses, we
can draw a conclusion that the orientation
states of I and II progressively transform into the orientation states
of III and IV with the crystallographic c-axis shifting
to TD during the second step of sequential biaxial stretching (shown
in Figure 6b). On the
other hand, although the biaxial orientation factors of the crystallographic c-axis for both films are close to the point of (0.5, 0.5),
the crystal orientation of the PE-6×6 film and PE-sim-6×6
film was different. Combined with the AFM results, the c-axis of the PE-6×6 film oriented either along MD or along TD,
while that of the PE-sim-6×6 film is isotropous in the film plane
(shown in Figure S4). Hence, there are
some differences regarding the mechanical properties of the two films.

Combined with the orientation factors and the parameters extracted
from the stress–strain curves shown in Table 1 and Table S2,
we can find that there may be some connection between the processing
and the structure. The ratio of the yield stress in MD and TD (1.64)
for the sample of PE-6×1 is consistent with the ratio of the
orientation factors of the crystallographic c-axis
(fc, MDB and fc, TDB), which
means that more lamellae oriented along MD than TD after yielding.
Moreover, the ratios of the stress (at the biaxial ratio of 6 ×
6) in MD and TD are 0.51 and 0.97 for the films of PE-6×6 and
PE-sim-6×6, respectively. The result is also consistent with
the ratios of orientation factors of the crystallographic c-axis, which signifies that more lamellae reoriented along
TD after sequential biaxial stretching and isotropous lamellae orientation
develops after simultaneous biaxial stretching. Hence, to some extent,
it may be a simple way to get the state of crystal orientation by
the parameters from the stress–strain curve.

3.6 Quantitative Analysis of Crystal Structure
The 2D-SAXS patterns for different samples are shown in Figure 7, where the equator
and meridian are defined as the horizontal direction (MD) and vertical
direction (TD), respectively. There was an isotropous scattering sign
in the sample of PE-0 because of the random crystal distribution.
After the stretching in MD, two significant signals were found in
PE-6×1, where two streaks across the beam stop appearing in the
meridian manifested the presence of the fibrillar structure, and two
maxima lobules along the equator revealed the existence of the periodic
lamellar stacks preferably oriented in MD.19,39,40 Subsequently, with the increase in λTD, the streak in the meridian disappeared and gradually transformed
into the arch-shaped scattering signal, which indicated that the fibrils
were either destroyed or oriented against MD. Meanwhile, the maximal
signal in the equator weakened progressively, but it is still there
until the biaxial draw ratio of 6 × 6. Accordingly, we found
that, although the well-arranged lamellae were destroyed during the
TD stretching, there were still some lamellar stacks along MD. Besides,
compared with the PE-0 film, the scattering signal of the PE-sim-6×6
film was a ring, suggesting more uniform crystal thickness after simultaneous
biaxial stretching.

Figure 7 2D-SAXS patterns for the sequentially biaxially stretched
films
prepared at various transverse draw ratios and the PE-sim-6×6
film. The horizontal and vertical arrows indicate MD and TD, respectively.

Long period (Lp), lamellar
thickness
(Lc), and amorphous thickness (La) for different samples are shown in Figure 8a. The Lc gradually increased before λTD = 4,
while it decreased for the ratios of 6 × 5 and 6 × 6, which
agreed well with the variation of crystallinity calculated from DSC
and WAXD. The change in Lc was due to
the coupling effects of the recrystallization for amorphous segments
and the destruction for lamellae along the MD.

Figure 8 (a) Lp, Lc, and La for the sequentially biaxially
stretched films prepared at various transverse draw ratios and the
PE-sim-6×6 film. (b) Llateral for
the sequentially biaxially stretched films prepared at various transverse
draw ratios.

The lamellar lateral dimension (Llateral) of the sequentially biaxially stretched films
is shown in Figure 8b, which is determined
from the relation41 10  where Δq2 is the full width at half maximum shown in Figure S5. The Llateral decreased from 25.1 nm (PE-6×1) to 19.3 nm (PE-6×6) with
the increase in λTD, which manifested that the lamellar
stacks along MD were gradually destroyed by the transverse stress.
Moreover, the results also agreed with the change in Xright shown in Figure 3c.

To investigate the scattering signals in a
specific region, the
1D-SAXS curves were acquired by integrating along the meridian and
equator direction shown in Figure S6. The
signals in the meridian and equator regions represented that the normal
of lamellae were parallel and perpendicular to MD, respectively.8,42Figure 9a plots the
SAXS scattering intensity of the meridian (Im), equator (Ie), and totality
(It) as a function of λTD, where Im gradually increased while Ie decreased during the transverse stretching.
Moreover, It increased at first and then
decreased after the draw ratio of 3. As shown in Figure 9b, the ratio of Ie to Im sharply declines from
3.16 to 1.63 at λTD = 2 and then progressively decreases
to 1.07 with the increase in λTD. In addition, the
PE-sim-6×6 film revealed almost the same scattering intensity
in the meridian and equator, which implied a more uniform crystal
distribution of simultaneous biaxial stretching than that of sequential
biaxial stretching. From the above analyses, we can draw a conclusion
that some of the lamellar stacks in PE-6×1 reoriented from MD
to TD under the transverse loading force.

meridian (Lm) and equator (Le) for the sequentially biaxially stretched films prepared
at various transverse draw ratios and the PE-sim-6×6 film.

Figure 9c plots
the long period in the meridian (Lm) and
the equator (Le) versus λTD. The Lm increased rapidly from 17.2
nm at the transverse draw ratio of 1 to 21 nm at the transverse draw
ratio of 6 for sequentially biaxially stretched films, while the Le showed a negligible change during the TD stretching,
which might be attributed to the increase in crystalline thickness
and extension of the amorphous chains along TD. Moreover, the values
of Lm and Le for the PE-sim-6×6 film were similar, suggesting a homogeneous
crystal distribution.

3.7 Mechanical and Optical Performance
The mechanical performances regarding Young’s modulus, tensile
strength, and elongation at break of different PE films are shown
in Figure 10a–c,
respectively. After biaxial stretching, a considerable promotion of
mechanical properties was observed, with Young’s modulus and
tensile strength rising to 445.0 and 102.3 MPa in MD, 490.2 and 114.1
MPa in DD, and 713.3 and 143.8 MPa in TD for the PE-6×6 film.
Moreover, Young’s modulus and the tensile strength of the PE-sim-6×6
film were increased to 579.6 and 113.4 MPa in MD, 602.7 and 115.3
MPa in DD, and 626.0 and 124.0 MPa in TD, respectively. On the contrary,
the elongation at break of both the PE-6×6 film and PE-sim-6×6
film in MD, DD, and TD decreased dramatically, while it was still
over 50%. Besides, the mechanical performances of PE-sim-6×6
in MD, DD, and TD were more uniform than those of PE-6×6. The
reason was that a highly oriented fibrillar network formed during
biaxial stretching along both MD and TD, which led to higher modulus
and strength and lower ductility.

Figure 10 (a) Young’s modulus, (b) tensile
strength, (c) elongation
at break, and (d) luminous transmittance for the films of PE-0, PE-6×6,
and PE-sim-6×6.

As shown in Figure 10d, both films of PE-6×6 and PE-sim-6×6
exhibit the excellent
optical clarity with T over 80% from the wavelength
of 400 to 800 nm. Moreover, the T of PE-sim-6×6
was larger than that of PE-6×6 and even achieved up to 90% at
the wavelength of 570 to 800 nm. It was clear that the excellent clarity
of the biaxially stretched film was due to the formation of the nanosized
crystal structure shown in Figure 2. Besides, some thick fibrils toward MD were observed
in the PE-6×6 film but not in the PE-sim-6×6 film, which
gave rise to the stronger visible light scattering and then the lower
luminous transmittance for the PE-6×6 film.

On the other
hand, as shown in Figures 1 and 10b, there may
be a correlation between the stretching force from the biaxial stretcher
and tensile strength in MD and TD. We can obviously find that the
film with the larger stretching force from biaxial stretcher has the
higher tensile strength. The reason is that the higher crystal orientation
results in the larger stretching force and the higher crystal orientation
leads to the higher tensile strength simultaneously. Hence, the larger
the stretching force, the higher the crystal orientation, and thus,
the higher the tensile strength.

3.8 Mechanism of Structure Evolution and Superior
Performance
Based on the analyses above, a schematic is proposed
to state the structure evolution and high performance for both PE-6×6
and PE-sim-6×6 shown in Figure 11. For the sequentially biaxial stretched process, the
spherulite structure is destroyed into small lamellar pieces, and
then those well-ordered lamellae are incorporated into the fibrillar
structure in the first tensile step. During the TD stretching, the
structure evolution can be classified into three regimes according
to the orientation. In the regime I (PE-6×1, PE-6×2, and
PE-6×3), some single fibrils are pulled away from the fibrillar
bundles, where the morphology with larger fibrillar bundles along
MD and the divided individual fibrils against MD is called a vein
structure. Moreover, some fibrils along TD gradually form by the partial
melting–recrystallization or lamellar rearrangement, and some
original lamellae are destroyed by the transverse loading force with
the decrease in lateral lamellae dimension. At this situation, the
orientation in MD decreases and the orientation in TD increases simultaneously,
but the general orientation is still in MD. In the regime II (PE-6×4),
more single fibrils are split from the fibrillar bundles, and more
fine fibrils orient along TD, leading to the development of the morphology
of a nanosized fiber-like network. In addition, the total biaxial
orientation for MD and TD reaches a balanced state, where the crystallographic c-axis was parallel to MD or TD in the film plane, the crystallographic b-axis is randomly distributed, and the crystallographic a-axis is partly perpendicular to the film plane. In the
regime III (PE-6×5 and PE-6×6), the fibrillar bundles become
smaller, and even some separated single fibrils rotate from MD to
TD. Although some vein structures are not susceptible to the transverse
stretching and are still parallel to MD, the majority of fibrils gradually
orient toward TD, which leads to the general orientation shifting
to TD. On the other hand, for the simultaneously biaxial stretched
process, the spherulites are destroyed into lamellar pieces, and some
fibrils gradually form by the melting–recrystallization or
lamellar rearrangement. Moreover, the orientation of the above lamellae
in PE-sim-6×6 was isotropous in the MD-TD plane, not like the
lamellar distribution of PE-6×6 either in MD or TD.

Figure 11 Schematic
mechanism of structure evolution for the PE-6×6
film and PE-sim-6×6 film.

The technology of biaxial stretching gives rise
to a conspicuous
enhancement of modules by almost 2 times and strength by about 4.5
times for the TF-BOPE films, which is due to the fact that the crystallographic c-axis is parallel to the MD-TD plane and the molecular
chains in the amorphous area are in an extended state. Although the
elongation at break decreases dramatically, it is still over 50%,
exhibiting good ductility. The PE-sim-6×6 film shows the more
uniform mechanical property in MD, DD, and TD than the PE-6×6
film because of isotropous lamellae orientation. Moreover, the luminous
transmittance of both films is over 80% due to the formation of nanosized
crystals. In addition, some large fibrillar bundles along MD give
rise to stronger visible light scattering and then lower luminous
transmittance for the PE-6×6 film. The above fibrillar bundles
are not found in the PE-sim-6×6 film, resulting in better optical
clarity.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we mainly
study the structure evolution of PE films
in sequential biaxial stretching and also take the simultaneous biaxial
stretching as a comparison. Moreover, we test the mechanical and optical
performance for both TF-BOPE films. The results show that the structure
evolution and performance are different for two processes. During
the MD stretching in the sequentially biaxially stretched process,
the original spherulites are destroyed into lamellar pieces, and then
the above lamellar fragments are incorporated into the fibrillar structure.
Subsequently, the separation of the single fibrils takes place, which
leads to the development of the nanosized fiber-like network. The
general orientation reaches a balanced state in MD and TD at the biaxial
ratio of 6 × 4. On the other hand, the simultaneously biaxially
stretched film (PE-sim-6×6) shows the isotropous lamellae distribution
in the film plane. More importantly, both films of PE-6×6 and
PE-sim-6×6 have a noteworthy increment in modulus and strength
and also exhibit the excellent optical clarity. In addition, because
of more uniform crystal orientation, the mechanical performance of
PE-sim-6×6 is isotropous in MD, DD, and TD.
