We
use a paradigmatic mathematic model known as Sierpiński fractal to reverse-engineer artificial nanostructures that can potentially
serve as plasmonic metasurfaces as well as nanogap electrodes. Herein,
we particularly demonstrate the possibility of obtaining multispectral
extraordinary optical transmission-like transmission peaks from fractal-inspired
geometries, which can preserve distinct spatial characteristics. To
achieve enhanced volumetric interaction and thermal responsiveness
within the framework, we consider a bilayer, quasi-three-dimensional
(3D) configuration that relies on the unique approach of combining
complementary and noncomplementary surfaces, while avoiding the need
for multilayer alignment on the nanoscale. We implement an improved
version of the model to (1) increase the volume of quasi-3D nanochannels
and enhance the lightening-rod effect of the metasurfaces, (2) harness
cross-coupling as a mechanism for achieving better sensitivity, and
(3) exploit optical magnetism for pushing the resonances to longer
wavelengths on a miniaturized platform. We further demonstrate vertical
coupling as an effective route for ultimate miniaturization of such
quasi-3D nanostructures. We report a wavelength shift up to 1666 nm/refractive
index unit and 2.5 nm/°C, implying the usefulness of the proposed
devices for applications such as dielectrophoretic sensing and nanothermodynamic
study of molecular reactions in the chemically active mid-IR spectrum.

Introduction
In the last few years,
the field of plasmonics has received extensive
attention from researchers because of plasmon’s formidable
ability to couple free-space electromagnetic excitation into a nanoscale
volume and enhance near-field optical intensity. Such a unique advantage
of metal optics paves the way for engineering light–matter
interactions more feasibly, and with the recent advancement in nanotechnology,
plasmonics has become the burgeoning research topic in energy harvesting,
telecom, and sensing industries.1−5 High-refractive-index dielectrics are also becoming a focus of interest
in light-harvesting applications due to their notable capability of
enhancing near- and far-field light–matter interactions.6−9 The virtue of this emerging platform lies in its low optical loss
and potential compatibility with the silicon-based CMOS process. Nevertheless,
the performance of conventional 2D plasmonic devices in sensing applications
is still strongly limited by the rapid decay of the electric field
as the distance from the metal surface increases. This bottleneck
of distance-limited 2D devices can be addressed by extending the dimension
of the field interaction as that in three-dimensional (3D) or quasi-3D
configurations and therefore achieving volumetric field enhancement,
providing a higher degree of access to the surrounding material and
a larger surface area.10,11 Furthermore, the 3D nature of
the device can generate complex transmission spectra, which are quite
likely to be more sensitive to the structural perturbation.12 Besides, the bilayer quasi-3D structures with
increased interaction volume can potentially achieve high sensitivity
to external stimulation, for instance, temperature, as opposed to
the conventional single-layer thermoplasmonic sensor.13 Therefore, the quasi-3D configuration only requiring single-step
lithography can be considered as a feasible solution toward improving
the performance of the existing plasmonic sensors. However, the quasi-3D
structures reported to date are mainly based on a simple nanohole
or nanodisk structure and targeted for limited applications in the
visible and near-IR ranges.14−17 More complicated nanostructures are yet to be explored
to achieve new functionalities at the expense of a higher fabrication
tolerance. Among the various categories of nanostructures reported
so far to manipulate localized surface plasmon resonance, the bow-tie
architecture holds a unique position because of its extremely large
field enhancement, partially aided by the lightening-rod effect at
the sharp tips. It has been used as the key element for many high-performance
plasmonic applications, such as nanolithography18 ultra-low-power optical trapping,19 single-molecule fluorescence detection,20 extreme UV generation,21 and as a plasmonic
photography film for high-density storage.22 On the other hand, fractal plasmonics is currently receiving the
attention of researchers to engineer broadband characteristics of
optical devices on a nanoscale because of the self-similarity and
precisely defined mathematical model of fractal. Fractal nanostructures
have already been exploited for subdiffraction focusing,23 transparent metallic electrodes,24 photovoltaic efficiency enhancement,25 molecular fluorescence and surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy enhancement,26,27 broadband light trapping,28 and, lately, multimodal broadband resonances
with degeneracies.29 Fortunately, the well-known Sierpiński fractal model is perfectly compatible
with the state-of-the-art bow-tie nanostructure, and in this work,
we particularly attempt to merge the two resourceful design platforms
to achieve several specific research goals. First, we exploit the
scalable resonance paths of the fractal layouts to obtain extraordinary
optical transmission (EOT)-like multispectral peaks, which have a
broad range of applications in interferometric sensing30 and self-calibrated surface-enhanced infrared
absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA).31 Second,
we consider the corners of the fractal geometries as reverse-engineered
routes for scaling up the number of electric field “hotspots”
in applications such as dielectrophoretic cell trapping.32,33 Here, we implement an upgraded version of the fractal layouts not
only to avoid the long-standing singularity issue of fractals but
also to achieve enhanced electromagnetic properties, such as volumetric
light–matter interactions, optical magnetism,34−36 and cross-coupling.37,38 We believe that the demonstration
can be extended further for judiciously designed dielectric metasurfaces
to realize low-loss sensing, light guiding, and spectroscopic applications.6−9 The overall organization of our work will be as follows: a systematic
conceptualization of the fractal-inspired metasurfaces; proof-of-concept
demonstration of the EOT-like peaks for volumetric sensing; demonstration
of vertical coupling of the quasi-3D structures for ultimate miniaturization;
and, finally, demonstration of volumetric refractive sensing and enhanced
thermoresponsive characteristics of the proposed platform.

Design Methodology
Arrangement
of the Fractalized Complementary and Noncomplementary
Layouts
In Figure 1a–c, we show the evolution of Sierpiński fractal
surfaces of orders 1 and 2 from the host equilateral triangle. A pattern
of a given order is generated by subdividing the remaining triangles
into four smaller congruent triangles, while removing the center one.
Note that the solid triangular components of an ideal fractal antenna
touch each other at a single point, which is why collective excitation
of all of the components cannot be possible, due to the geometric
singularity. Achieving such singularity by the state-of-the-art patterning
techniques is also not feasible. Figure 1 depicts the chronological development of
the modified abstraction considered in this work. In Figure 1k,l, we show the polarization-independent
cross-coupled configurations of two different orders (M1 and M2) of
fractalized devices on an oxide-coated substrate. Here, the modified
fractal triangle constitutes one of the four arms of the cross-coupled
patterns. We provide the parameter offset (f) not
only to avoid the geometric singularities in the simulation and fabrication
but also to exploit the strong impact of lightening-rod-derived surface
currents on the resonance properties. We further provide the split
gap (s) to achieve a dramatic enhancement of resonance
contrast and optical magnetism in the mid-IR region, as discussed
in the following sections. Note that through such a modified fractalization
process with a recursively changing Haudsoff dimension we still achieve
the coherently coupled self-symmetric radiators as numbered in Figures 1i and 2j. The height of the each host triangle is kept constant at
1.225 μm, roughly calculated from the half-wavelength dipole
equation defined as λ/2 = L, where L is the total length of the dipole under a given polarization.
Please note that because of the cross-coupled arrangement the resonance
characteristics of the patterns do not critically depend on the polarization,
albeit the profiles of the near-field enhancement can differ. Then,
we obtain the complementary first-order fractal surface, as shown
in Figure 1m, by subtracting
the noncomplementary one from the uniform metal surface according
to the Babinet principle. In the case of the second-order (M2) device,
we follow the same design rules and obtain the complementary pattern,
as shown in Figure 1p. The radiators in the noncomplementary surfaces thus appear as
subwavelength apertures in the complementary surfaces, which are indicated
in Figure 1m,p. A commercial
3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver (Lumerical) has been
deployed on a 16 core, 2.60 GHz Intel Xeon ES-2670 (64 GB memory)
processor to simulate the transmission spectrum at near field under x-polarized plane waves incident normally. The near-field
transmittance and reflectance have been captured by a transmission
monitor and reflection monitor, respectively, both placed 15 μm
away from the metal patterns. The simulation region has been terminated
by periodic boundary conditions along the x and y directions and a perfectly matched layer along the z direction. A spatial resolution of dx = 1 nm, dy = 1 nm, and dz = 1
nm is chosen for accurate meshing. Optical properties of gold have
been extracted from Palik. In Figures 2a and 1d, we mark the resonances
supported by the complementary and noncomplementary surfaces in the
simulated transmission spectra. As suggested by the Babinet principle,
the observed transmission peaks of the complementary surface correspond
to the transmission dips of the noncomplementary surface. However,
among the three distinct resonances of M1, resonance I originates
because of the complex interplay of the multiple resonance paths.39−41 The sharp linewidth of this resonance can be explored further in
the future study. On the contrary, resonance II is purely dipolar
and resonance III is purely magnetic in the noncomplementary M1 surface.
The magnetism at resonance III appears because of the presence of
the split gap in the noncomplementary M1 layout and is associated
with electric field enhancement at the split gap, as shown in Figure 1a. The corresponding
transmission peaks of the complementary M1 surface along with the
corresponding electric field distributions are shown in Figure 2b. Similarly, we observe a
new set of resonances along with the additional magnetic resonances
supported by the M2 patterns. The results along with the corresponding
electric field distributions are shown in Figure 2c,d. The consistent contrast in the electric
field distributions in Figure 2a,b and c,d is in strong agreement with the Babinet principle.
From the simulation results, it becomes obvious that spatially and
spectrally variant dipolar and magnetic modes can be sustained in
the different orders of fractal-derived patterns.

Construction of the Quasi-3D
Structures
Here, we propose
the idea of self-aligned vertical integration of complementary and
noncomplementary patterns for resonant optical transmission across
a wide band not only to scale down the size of the footprint but also
to bypass the challenge of nanometric alignment and topology in realizing
multilayer nanostructures.42,43Figure 3a,d shows conceptual 3D schematics of the
proposed idea. Figure 3b,e shows an exploded
view of the two patterns coupled to each other through the poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) spacer. The cross-sections of the devices are
shown in Figure 3c,f.
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) height profile of a conventional
bow-tie aperture without any fractal inclusion in Figure 3g illustrates the 3D nature
of the configuration and the formation of metal side walls during
the process. We further extract the phase profile in Figure 3h and indicate the presence
of bottom and top metal layers.

Evolution of the Broadband Optical Transparency Peaks
Figure 3i,j shows
the transmission peaks supported by the M1 and M2 devices, respectively.
The refractive index of PMMA has been modeled in the mid-IR range,
considering the C=O vibrational peak at 5.79 μm.44 The other weaker C–H peaks around 6–8
μm have been ignored in this work.44 The refractive indices of Si and SiO2 are set to be 3.47
and 1.45. We use the prime (′) and the double
prime (″) symbols to distinguish between the first-
and the second-order layouts, respectively. It can be observed that
both of the configurations preserve five distinct peaks (D1′–D5′ and D1″–D5″) across the whole spectrum. The feature observed
between D3′ and D4′, at around
5.79 μm, can be termed as the absorption-induced transparency
(AIT) peak, which is a recent phenomenon of quantum electrodynamics.45,46 We analyze the complex devices by subdividing them into two layers:
top and bottom, as shown in Figure 3b,e. However, the presence of the PMMA framework and
substrate can cause strong modulations of the resonances coming from
both the layers. Hence, while simulating the top layer, the PMMA template
is still attached at the bottom to take the refractive-index-induced
shift into account, and while simulating the bottom layer, the substrate
along with the oxide layer atop is not removed. Our proposition is
that the transmission peaks from the top and bottom layers can be
superimposed on each other without causing significant interference
due to the shift caused by the presence of the PMMA spacer. We present
the layer-specific peaks from M1 and M2 obtained by such a simulation
in Figure 3k,l, respectively,
and tag them with a number corresponding to a particular resonance
peak in Figure 3i,j,
respectively. It is observed that the peaks from the original devices
can be roughly approximated by superimposing the peaks from the top
and bottom layers, although a strong coupling-induced redshift and
a change in peak intensity are observed.47 Interestingly, the weak D5′ resonance in Figure 3i cannot be ascribed to any
layer-specific peak. Rather, it is an outcome of strong coupling between
the two layers around the wavelength marked by a dashed line in Figure 3k. The AIT peak between
D3′ and D4′ and the transmission
dip between D3″ and D4″ can
be double-confirmed by the simulation results in Figure 3m, in which the vibrational
mode of the PMMA is artificially removed. The structural dependence
of the AIT phenomenon can be further verified from the transmission
spectrum in Figure 3n of a conventional bow-tie structure in a quasi-3D configuration,
as shown in Figure 3g,h. More importantly, the series of resonance peaks disappears in Figure 3n when the fractal
patterns are excluded. The sensitivity of the resonance peaks supported
by the quasi-3D structures can be confirmed from the simulation results
in Figure 3i–k
when the background refractive index is increased by 10%.

Fabrication
and Characterization
The simplified process
flow of the fabrication is shown in Figure 4a–e. A PMMA e-beam resist of thickness Rt is spin-coated on a clean oxide substrate.
We consider three different values of Rt (110, 180, and 250 nm) to study the coupling between the top and
bottom layers. However, increasing Rt can
strongly affect the fidelity of the sharp corners of the fractals
due to the increased forward scattering range parameter of the e-beam.
The nanopatterns are obtained with a high-resolution 100 kV ELS-7000
Electron Beam Lithography equipment using raster scanning. The e-beam
current is maintained at 200 pA. No proximity correction or indium
tin oxide charge compensation layer has been considered for the current
batch of chips. The development time is controlled at 70 s in a 1:3
methyl isobutyl ketone/isopropanol solution. Finally, a 5 nm thick
Cr layer, followed by a 35 nm thick gold layer, is deposited by the
Denton Explorer e-beam evaporator. Metal side walls as shown in Figure 4e can be present
due to the shadowing effect, requiring careful optimization between
the metal thickness (tm) and critical
dimension (CD) for successful implementation of the complex quasi-3D
nanostructures. We repeatedly obtain a minimum feature size of 44
nm, as shown in Figure 4g, whereas the total metal thickness remains fixed at 40 nm. Note
that such a side wall can strongly affect the broadband resonances
by introducing constant damping into the cavity system partially formed
by the two self-aligned reflecting layers. Figure 4f,h shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the large-area nanopatterns of orders 1 and 2 obtained
by field-emission SEM. The zoomed-in view of the unit cells are shown
in Figure 4g,i. Because
of the 3D topography, we observe strong secondary electron emission
from the edges of the geometries. The false-color SEM in Figure 4j illustrates the
multiple resonance paths of the second-order fractal. After careful
inspection, we observe strong backscattering-induced roundedness of
the fractal corners, as shown in Figure 4k, which can cause deviation of the experimental
results from the simulation results to some extent. Finally, the 3D
metal side walls have been investigated using a Bruker AFM with a
Si tip of 5 nm radius. The results have been postprocessed by NanoScope
Analysis and illustrated in Figure 4l.

complementary and noncomplementary layouts of M2 are merged to each

by the red dashed rectangle.

Normalized transmission and reflection
spectra have been obtained on a broadband Agilent Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The area of the aperture is considered
to be 100 μm × 100 μm. The reflectance of the devices
is normalized with respect to that of a smooth gold surface, and the
transmittance is normalized with respect to the free-space transmission
of light. The size of the aperture was adjusted carefully to match
the size of each square pattern, thus eliminating the background reflection.
The sampling resolution is maintained at 4 cm–1 to
minimize the presence of water absorption peaks, although the CO2 peak at 4.26 μm can appear in the spectrum, depending
on the ambient concentration. The mirror repetition rate is fixed
at 40 kHz, and the number of scans is maintained at 64.

Results
and Analysis
Proof-of-Concept Demonstration
Figure 5a,e shows a proof-of-concept demonstration
of broadband mid-IR transmission peaks supported by fractal devices.
The corresponding reflection dips for the M1 and M2 patterns are provided
in the Supporting Information for further verification (Figures S1 and S2). It has been found that the
resonant transmittance can reach up to 50% (D1″) in the far-field measurement in an otherwise opaque medium. Such
a level of EOT-like transmission despite the presence of a bottom
layer indicates the potential for resonance-based applications of
the devices in the transmission mode. Also note that the conventional
bow-tie structure in the quasi-3D configuration can only support two
modes within the range of interest. On the other hand, the fractal
patterns can support at least five distinct resonances, as predicted
by the 3D FDTD simulation results in Figure 3i,j. Several weak features such as the D2″
resonance with a kink, the minor dip around the D4″ region,
and the presence of the D5′ shoulder are exactly captured by
the highly sensitive LN2-cooled HgCdTe detector of the
FTIR spectrometer. The appearance of
the AIT peak is also obvious in Figure 5a, as indicated by the dashed line. The experimental
reflection and transmission spectra of the PMMA thin film are provided
in Figures S3 and S4. The transmission
dip around the C=O transition clearly confirms the existence
of the AIT peak supported by the M1 device. Here, we classify the
five resonances of each of the devices on the basis of their spatial
nature at the bottom plane. A bow-tie triangle can exhibit transverse
(dipolar) and longitudinal resonances of different orders in its conventional
shape. Because of the presence of the split gap, we also expect the
magnetic resonance in a modified form while the dipolar effect exists. Figure 5b–d,f–h
shows the electric field distribution at three different planes (0,
90, and 180 nm) of the M1 and M2 devices, respectively. By tracking
the location of the peak electric field at the bottom plane, we classify
the resonances as dipolar, magnetic, and dipolar–magnetic in
the table of Figure 5(inset). The field profiles at the top plane (180 nm) clearly indicate
the hotspots available in the corners of the modified fractal layouts
across a broad range of wavelengths, which are formed by the enhanced
lightening-rod effect of the fractal patterns. Such hotspots are potentially
useful for chemical-specific dielectrophoretic sensing in the mid-IR
range. On the contrary, a complex transformation of the phase and
intensity of the electric fields occurs along the depth direction.
Such field transformation in a thin region opens up a new avenue for
volumetric refractive index sensing of solutions. We further demonstrate
high-fidelity fabrication of the proposed nanostructures. There exist
two nanoscale parameters, f and s, in the noncomplementary fractal patterns for the precise tuning
of resonance characteristics. The key mechanism of tuning the dipolar
modes lies in engineering the surface current so as to manipulate
dipolar moment p, defined as48 1  Here, J is the polarization
current density determined by the displacement field and electric
field of the structure. Parameter f can strongly
affect the moment, as it will alter the charge density at the junctions
of the fractal patterns. Parameter s is essential
here to enforce all of the constituent radiators to supplement the
surface current at the acute junctions. Besides, s will allow the magnetic resonance whose wavelength is defined as , where L and C are the inductance and capacitance of the structure, respectively.
The intensity of the magnetic resonance is proportional to the magnetic
moment m, defined as48 2  On the basis of the Babinet principle,
it
is obvious that f and s will have
equivalent impacts on the complementary surfaces. Thus, f and s can reasonably engineer the resonance intensity
and location of the actual 3D fractal devices by the strong manipulation
of moments. We show the simulation and experimental results of M1
in Figure 6a–d
as parameters f and s are varied.
Despite the presence of a metal side wall, we observe a good agreement
between the simulation and experimental results. For instance, a consistent
increase in the D4′ and D5′ intensities is observed
as parameter f is increased, which is in agreement
with simulation. In contrast to that in f, the variation
in s does not yield a noticeable change in the intensity
and location of the resonances both in the simulation and in the experiment.
Similarly, for the M2 design, the role of f in altering
the resonance characteristics is found to be more dominant than that
of s both in the simulation and in the experiment
(Figure S5d–g). A rather detailed
analysis of such a variation can be found in the Supporting Information
(Figures S6–S9). The results indicate
a high repeatability and control of the fabrication process for the
reversed-engineered nanostructures in the presence of multiple practical
issues, for example, e-beam scattering and charging and side walls.

found to be the most strongly influenced by the coupling distance
in the experiment.

Vertical Coupling of Quasi-3D
Nanostructures
Figure 6e–g shows
the vertical coupling along the xz plane through
the y = 0 line for the strongly coupled resonances:
D4′, D5′, and D5″, respectively. We study the
role of such coupling by varying the spacing (H)
as determined by the PMMA thickness during fabrication. Three different
thicknesses, 110, 180, and 250 nm, have been considered. Note that
at a higher PMMA thickness pattern distortion can be crucial because
of the increased forward scattering of the e-beam. On the other hand,
at a lower thickness, the metal side wall issues could be even more
complicated because of the possible shortening
of the top and bottom layer by the shadowing effect. Nevertheless,
the results in Figure 6a–d show strong agreement between simulation and experiment
for the strongly coupled resonances. We observe a strong redshift
as the spacing is decreased, which can be explained by treating the
coupled metal–dielectric–metal system as an optical
circuit.49 As the spacing is decreased,
the capacitance induced between the two metal layers is increased.
This can yield a longer resonance wavelength, as predicted by . An intensity change is also
observed as
the spacing is changed, again indicating the role of vertical coupling
in the resonant conditions of the transmission peaks. Such a unique
design freedom of the proposed quasi-3D devices makes them potentially
useful for ultracompact sensors in massively parallel and broadband
applications. In particular, pixelated thermal imaging devices require
highly scalable multispectral unit cells, while minimizing the usage
of the chip real estate. Thus, the vertical coupling-mediated height
dependence of the fractalized quasi-3D surfaces will be technologically
important for harnessing a broad range of useful black-body radiations
(3–12 μm) on a significantly reduced footprint area.

Volumetric Refractive Index Sensing
The proposed fractal
architectures can be treated as a novel platform for multiple analyte
SEIRA, which is a powerful biomedical analysis tool.50,51 The quasi-3D nanochannels of the nanostructures in which volumetric
enhancement of the electric field occurs can be potentially useful
for such applications. Herein, because of the hybrid nature of the
devices, we consider both purely plasmonic modes (D4′ and D1″)
and the hybridized features (between D3′ and D4′ and
between D3″ and D4″) and demonstrate their volumetric
refractive index sensitivity in the reflection mode. After carefully
rinsing in deionized water, the samples are quickly tested to observe
the incurred wavelength shift. We calculate refractive index unit
(RIU) shifts of 833.3333 and 123 nm for the plasmonic mode and hybridized
mode of the M1 device, respectively, as shown in Figure 7a,d. Note that the PMMA was
hard-baked before metal deposition and the spectrum reverts to its
original position after drying in N2 flow. Thus, the influence
of soaking by PMMA can be safely ignored in this case. We further
attempt to understand the contribution of the light–matter
interaction inside the nanochannels shown in Figure 7, totaling a volume of 0.69925 μm3 per unit cell, while having a minimum aperture area of 0.178
μm2. As observed in Figure 7c,d, a monotonic increase in the wavelength
shift persists when the four channels are sequentially infiltrated
(25, 50, 75, 100%) under a given polarization. We conduct a similar
experiment for the M2 device, which has a total channel volume of
0.6037 μm3 per unit cell, while the minimum aperture
size is now reduced to 0.032 μm2. The RIU shift calculated
from Figure 8a,d becomes
1666 and 60 nm for the purely plasmonic mode and hybridized mode,
respectively. The ∼2 times increase in the shift of the plasmonic
mode can be justified by the enhanced modulation observed in the simulation
results in Figure 8c, where the nanochannels are assumed to be infiltrated sequentially.
Under a given polarization, a noticeable cross-coupling is also observed
as the sample infiltration increases from 25 to 50% or from 75 to
100%. Considering a less volume of interaction in the second-order
design, such enhanced sensitivity can be qualitatively attributed
to the complexity of the light–matter interaction within the
unit cell. On the other hand, the hybridized mode undergoes a narrowing,
followed by a shift, as shown in Figure 8d. This is caused by the shift of the background
plasmonic mode, as indicated by the dotted arrow in Figure 8d,e. The coupling between the
plasmonic mode and PMMA absorption is also changed due to the presence
of water.53

sensing for the M1 structure. Experimental shifts in the (a) D4′
resonance, (d) the hybridized feature between the D3′ and D4′
resonances, (b) the distribution of the volumetric nanochannels in
the M1 device along with the total channel volume and smallest aperture
area. Simulated evolution of the wavelength shifts as the channels
are sequentially infiltrated: (c) D4′ resonance and (e) hybridized
feature between the D3′ and D4′ resonances. The dashed
arrows indicate the spectral locations of the features and modulation
of the spectrum. The dashed rectangle indicates the presence of the
feature that possibly originates because of the structural imperfection
of the nanostructures and cannot be captured by the simulation model.
The refractive index of water is assumed to be 1.3 at the mid-IR spectrum
for the simulation.52

Figure 8 Volumetric refractive index sensing for the M2 structure. Experimental
shifts in the (a) D1″ resonance, (d) the hybridized feature
between the D3″ and D4″ resonances, and (b) the distribution
of the volumetric nanochannels in the M2 device along with the total
channel volume and smallest aperture area. Simulated evolution of
the wavelength shifts as the channels are sequentially infiltrated:
(c) D1″ resonance and (e) the hybridized feature between the
D3″ and D4″ resonances. The narrowing of the quality
factor of the feature is observed both in the experiment and in the
simulation, which can be partly attributed to the redshift of the
adjacent D3″ resonance, as indicated by the black dotted line.
The green dashed arrow indicates the spectral locations of the features
and modulation of the spectrum. The green dashed rectangle indicates
the presence of the weak D2″ feature, which overlaps with the
D1″ mode as the wavelength shift occurs. The refractive index
of water is assumed to be 1.3 at the mid-IR spectrum for the simulation.52

Thermoresponsive Characteristics
Finally, we demonstrate
a reversible thermoresponsive tuning mechanism for the quasi-3D structures
by relying on the permittivity change of the metal with temperature.
We propose that bilayer metallic structures can obtain better thermoresponsive
characteristics as compared to those of single-layered devices. Such
an improvement will be mainly mediated by vertical coupling, as demonstrated
in the previous section. The temperature dependence of metal permittivity
is incorporated into the simulation by the modified Drude model, as
below54 3  Here, ωp is the
plasma frequency,
Γ is the Drude damping parameter, and α is the factor
to quantify the increase in damping as the temperature is increased.
The nominal values of ωp and Γ are set at 9
and 0.07 eV, respectively, in the unit of energy. A temperature increase
by 100° is considered in this work. Therefore, the change in
real part of the PMMA refractive index can be safely ignored.55 However, thermal broadening
of PMMA absorption can occur according to the power law for the vibrational
mode, defined as γ(T) ∝ Tn , where γ is the linewidth, T is the temperature, and exponent n is
greater than 1.56 For the measurement,
the sample is placed on a heating stage, which is capable of heating
up to 450 °C. The temperature of the stage is controlled by a
temperature controller, with a variation of less than 5%. The sample
chamber is properly insulated from the ambience. Measurements are
taken 5 min after the stable reading of a particular temperature is
reached. In the current setup, only the reflection signal can be captured
while the heating stage is incorporated. Temperature-induced shifts
of ∼2.5 and 2.47 nm/°C are experimentally observed in Figure 9a,e for the purely
plasmonics modes D4′ and D1″, respectively. The shifts
obtained are at least 14.3 times better than those from the previous
thermoplasmonic sensor, which we attribute to the vertical coupling
in the bilayer structures. To understand the role of the bilayer structure,
we conduct a detailed simulation in Figure 9b–d,f–h. It is clear from the
results that the thermoresponsive behavior of the proposed nanostructures
is concurrently aided by both the layers.

Figure 9 Thermal responses of
the bilayer plasmonic metasurfaces. Experimentally
observed shifts of the pure plasmonic modes caused by resistive heating
of the metal: (a) D4′ resonance in M1, (e) D1″ resonance
in M2. Simulated shifts when both layers are assumed to be heated:
(b) D4′ resonance in M1 and (f) D1″ resonance in M2;
when the top layer is heated: (c) D4′ resonance in M1 and (g)
D1″ resonance in M2; and when the bottom layer is heated: (d)
D4′ resonance in M1 and (h) D1″ resonance in M2. The
solid arrows indicate the spectral locations of the features and modulation
of the spectrum. The red dashed rectangle indicates the region that
is assumed to be heated. The dashed lines indicate the reference position
when no heating is assumed in the simulation.

The individual effects of each metal layer in both the devices
(M1 and M2) are evident from the simulation results presented in Figure 9c,d,g,h, where the
layer-specific metal permittivity is selectively altered. Detailed
investigation into the combined effect may further identify the contribution
of vertical coupling in bilayer geometry toward the enhanced thermoresponsivity
of the supported plasmonic modes.

Later, we consider the hybridized
features as discussed previously
in Figure 10a,d for
thermal tuning. This time a shift of the hybridized feature is observed
for the M1 case. For the M2 case, the shift in the background resonance
mode is clearly observable. Note that the temperature dependence of
these modes can be simultaneously associated with the permittivity
change and linewidth broadening of PMMA, making it challenging to
exactly reproduce the experimental observation in the simulation.
Nevertheless, we attempt to decouple the two effects by the simulation
results in Figure 10b,c,e,f. It becomes obvious that the shift and intensity variation
observed in the experiment is significantly associated with the thermally
driven reversible change in the metal permittivity. We believe that
the enhanced thermoresponsive behavior of the structure in conjunction
with mid-IR operation will pave the way for chemical-specific nanothermodynamic
study of reactions.

Figure 10 Thermal responses
of the bilayer plasmonic metasurfaces. Experimentally observed shifts
in the hybridized modes caused by resistive heating of the metal and
broadening of the PMMA vibrational absorption: (a) M1 and (d) M2.
Simulated shifts when only PMMA is heated: (b) M1 and (e) M2 and when
the metal layers are heated: (c) M1 and (f) M2. The dashed arrows
indicate the spectral locations of the features in the spectra. The
solid arrows indicate modulation of the spectra in terms of intensity
variation and wavelength shift.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate a fractal-inspired
quasi-3D platform
for thermoresponsive, volumetric, and multispectral detection at the
mid-IR spectrum in a small footprint. Fabrication of the nanoarchitectures
relies on single-step lithography and therefore can be feasibly deployed
for large-scale application. Enhanced electromagnetic properties,
such as cross-coupling, optical magnetism, and the lightening-rod
effect, have been critically considered for the development of the
final layouts. We demonstrate the proof-of-concept by closely matching
the experimental results with those from the simulation and performing
extensive parameter variation. Furthermore, we successfully report
vertical coupling to be an alternative pathway for ultimate miniaturization
of quasi-3D devices. Finally, we demonstrate volumetric refractive
sensing and enhanced thermoresponsive behavior of the nanostructures
successfully. We believe that the proposed multispectral platform
will establish a new avenue for dielectrophoretic cell study and thermoresponsive
volumetric sensing in the chemically active mid-IR spectrum.
