Lactic
acid is an attractive target platform chemical obtained
from biorefinery processes based on renewable resources. This study
focuses on the recovery of lactic acid from corn stover hemicellulose-derived
liquor. Two processes were investigated comparatively. In process
I, under the optimized conditions of 10 wt % trioctylamine/octanol,
the extraction efficiency and distribution coefficient of lactic acid
were 50.8% and 1.03, respectively. In process II, a salting-out extraction
step was introduced, which had significant impacts on the following
reactive extraction process. The extraction efficiency and distribution
coefficient of lactic acid were about 32.2% and 3.85 times higher
than that of process I, respectively. All residual sugars and most
of the salts (82.8%) could be removed by the salting-out extraction
system used. Additionally, five extraction cycles with back-extraction
and solvent regeneration were performed, and the results showed that
the extraction system still exhibited stable performance. Effective
extraction of lactic acid from crude reaction liquor of corn stover
was realized by first salting-out and consecutive reactive extraction,
which provided a potential method for recovery of lactic acid from
actual biomass-derived liquor.

1 Introduction
Due to the depletion of
resources and increasing environmental
impacts, the traditional methods of obtaining chemicals from fossil
resources have been facing more and more challenges, and there is
a growing emphasis on converting renewable resources to chemicals.1 Biomass, especially lignocellulosic biomass,
is considered to be a promising substrate due to its widespread existence
and its current low utilization rate.2 Various
technologies are used to convert lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals,
among which the chemical catalytic conversion of lignocellulose to
lactic acid is a promising and versatile technique.3−7 Lactic acid is an important industrial chemical product
and is considered to be one of the top 10 chemicals obtained from
biorefineries as declared by the United States Department of Energy.8 The largest application of lactic acid is being
used as a food additive, followed by being used to produce poly(lactic
acid). The latter is one kind of environment-friendly and biodegradable
plastic, and its potential wide application has been attracting more
and more attention.9,10 At present, lactic acid is mainly
produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (e.g., glucose).
However, owing to high costs of carbon sources, the economic feasibility
of industrial production of the rather inexpensive product, lactic
acid, is challenging.11 Recently, many
scholars have used lignocellulosic biomass as a cheap carbon source
to develop a highly cost-efficient chemical catalytic conversion process
for the production of lactic acid. Although the production of lactic
acid from lignocellulosic biomass has multiple advantages, the downstream
processing of reaction liquor has met with some difficulties. The
crude reaction liquor is a complex mixture system, and the concentration
of lactic acid is very low.4 Thus, it is
imperative to explore an efficient process for the recovery of lactic
acid, especially the recovery of lactic acid from the reaction liquor
obtained directly from the catalytic conversion of lignocellulose,
which is crucial for the comprehensive utilization of lignocellulosic
biomass.

A classical way of recovering lactic acid from fermentation
broth
is the precipitation of lactic acid by adding Ca(OH)2 to
the broth forming calcium lactate. Some of the disadvantages include
the tedious multistep process, which could lead to the loss of lactate,
and the gypsum (CaSO4) residue formed must be discarded.10 Therefore, some new and economically effective
downstream routes, which could avoid the inherent drawbacks of the
conventional route, have been developed to recover lactic acid from
different industrial waste streams or fermentation broths, including
adsorption,12−14 membrane separation,15,16 electrodialysis,17 solvent extraction,18 esterification hydrolysis,19 molecular
distillation,20 etc. However, the wide
application of these techniques is limited due to some drawbacks,
such as small processing capacity, high energy consumption, and the
use of expensive equipment. In view of these limitations, the reactive
liquid–liquid extraction process—with the advantages
of low temperature, low cost, high efficiency, high yield, and simple
operation—has been considered as a promising recovery technology.21 High-molecular-weight alkylamine22−25 and organophosphorus compounds10,26 dissolved
in diluents such as oleyl alcohol have a higher extraction efficiency
for lactic acid. Due to the existence of high hydrogen-bonding acceptor
basicity in the extractant, lactic acid is extracted to the organic
phase by strong interaction with the extractant forming acid–amine
complexes, and finally the lactic acid is stripped from the load phase
by vacuum evaporation or back-extraction.27,28 In addition, different diluents influence the extraction degree,
of which polar diluents are more effective than nonpolar ones.29,30 Many new attempts have been made to obtain higher extraction efficiency
of lactic acid, such as using quaternary ammonium salts31,32 and mixed extractants33 and the development
of new extractants.34 It was found that
the mixtures of alkylamine and tri-n-butylphosphate
had a synergistic effect on the extraction of lactic acid.35

In recent years, although the conversion
of lignocellulosic biomass
to lactic acid has been extensively studied, only limited research
on the recovery of lactic acid from actual lignocellulose derived
liquor has been reported.36−38 Reactive extraction is considered
a promising recovery technology and has been reported in the recovery
of high-value chemicals from hydrolysates of lignocellulose.39−41 However, for lactic acid, most investigations on the extraction
are based on simulated solutions, whereas only a few exploratory studies
have focused on recovery of lactic acid from actual fermentation broth,
and the yield was much lower than that in the aqueous solution.10,42 In this work, through preliminary exploration, it was found that
the direct reactive extraction of lactic acid in corn stover hemicellulose-derived
liquor was not effective enough.

Salting-out extraction—which
is based on the different distribution
behavior of chemicals in the two phases composed of H2O,
low-molecular-weight organic solvent as the extractant, and inorganic
salt as the salting-out reagent43—as
a promising strategy for the preliminary purification and recovery
of bio-based molecules, exhibits excellent recovery performance for
lactic acid in fermentation broths.44−46 For example, the extraction
efficiency and distribution coefficient of 90.6% and 3.23, respectively,
were obtained by using a salting-out system of K2HPO4/ethanol to recover lactic acid from fermentation broths.46 However, for the mixture directly derived from
the conversion of corn stover by chemical catalysis, after preliminary
exploration, the selectivity of salting-out extraction to lactic acid
was not satisfied due to its complexity.

In this work, a salting-out
extraction system was introduced into
the recovery process to treat the corn stover hemicellulose-derived
liquor for reducing its complexity so that the high selectivity of
the reactive extraction could perform better. Two parallel experiments
between the hemicellulose-derived liquor (HDL) and treated hemicellulose-derived
liquor ((THDL), by salting-out extraction) were conducted, and three
key variables (extractant amount, pH, and phase ratio) were adopted
to evaluate the lactic acid recovery performance of the extraction
system. In addition, to obtain higher lactic acid extraction performance
and a complete recovery process, multistage extraction, stripping,
and recycle of the extraction system were also investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of the
Initial and Treated
Corn Stover Hemicellulose-Derived Liquor
The hemicellulose
in the corn stover was converted to lactic acid by a two-step process,
where MgO was used as the catalyst for lactic acid production in the
second step. The pH of the initial reaction liquor was 6.9 ±
0.1. According to the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES)
results, the concentrations of the components in the initial reaction
liquor, HDL, and THDL are listed in Table 1. The principal component in the initial
reaction liquor was lactic acid, and limited glucose, xylose, and
furfural were obtained. The K+ and Mg2+ contents
reached approximately 122 and 460 ppm, respectively, for the initial
reaction liquor. Activated carbon could adsorb colored substances
(e.g., furfural, humins) from the initial reaction liquor, and there
was a slight removal of K+ and Mg2+, whereas
sugars and lactic acid remained almost unchanged. After the salting-out
treatment, the concentration of sodium ions increased due to the use
of sodium chloride, but the total ion concentration of THDL decreased
significantly, and no residual sugars were detected.

2.2 Effect of Extractant Concentration
The organic phases with different trioctylamine (TOA) concentrations
were configured to extract lactic acid from HDL and THDL. Figure 1A,B shows the relationship
between the initial TOA concentration with extraction efficiency and
the distribution coefficient, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 1, when TOA was mixed
with active diluent octanol, the extraction efficiency and equilibrium
distribution coefficient (KD) of lactic
acid significantly improved. When pure octanol was used, only 13%
lactic acid was extracted from THDL. However, at TOA concentration
of 2%, the extraction efficiency reached 49.8%. At low TOA concentration,
both the extraction efficiency and the distribution coefficient increased
with the TOA concentration. It could be seen that increasing TOA concentration
had a positive effect on the recovery of lactic acid. The influencing
trend for HDL was the same as that for THDL, but the extraction performance
of THDL was significantly higher than that of HDL. For instance, at
TOA concentration of 10 wt %, the extraction efficiency and distribution
coefficient of lactic acid in HDL were up to 50.8% and 1.03, respectively.
Under the same condition, the extraction efficiency and distribution
coefficient of lactic acid from THDL reached 83% and 4.88, respectively,
which were 32.2% and 3.85 higher than that with HDL.

Figure 1 Effect of extractant
concentration in octanol on lactic acid extraction
efficiency (A) and distribution coefficient (B) (conditions: 10 min,
25 °C, pH = 1.6, O/A = 1).

In the process of reactive extraction, lactic acid and amines
form
ion pairs and then enter the organic phase.21 The degree of TOA dilution plays a key role, which could affect
the basicity of the amine and the stability and solvation of the formed
ion pair. The polar active diluent octanol might dissolve the acid–amine
complex through specific hydrogen bonds between the octanol and the
acid–amine complex.23 At lower extractant
concentration, the polarity of the solvent system was still high.
With the increase of TOA concentration, this synergistic effect increased
the interaction of TOA with lactic acid and promoted the transfer
of lactic acid to the organic phase. However, at 10 wt % or even higher
TOA concentration, the distribution coefficient of lactic acid remained
constant since equilibrium was reached. Although excessive TOA was
conducive for the formation of the acid–amine complex, poor
solvation ability and high viscosity of TOA might inhibit the accumulation
of the complex. Moreover, the price of TOA is higher than that of
octanol, which can inhibit the economic applicability of this process
at a high amine loading rate. According to the above considerations,
the optimal extraction process using 10 wt % concentration was chosen
in this work.

2.3 Effect of pH
To
evaluate the effect
of pH on lactic acid extraction, the extraction of lactic acid was
carried out with different pH values. The results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen
that the pH value had a significant influence on both the extraction
efficiency and distribution coefficient of lactic acid. As the pH
increased, the extraction efficiency and distribution coefficient
of lactic acid both increased sharply first and then decreased, whereas
the undissociated rate of lactic acid continuously decreased. It might
be caused by the fact that TOA could only form ion pairs with the
lactic acid molecule, whereas the deprotonated lactic acid still remained
in the aqueous phase.47 According to the
ionization of lactic acid, the existence form of lactic acid was determined
by the pH values. Therefore, the extraction efficiency and distribution
coefficient were sensitive to pH condition, and more lactic acid was
extracted at lower pH. However, poor extraction efficiency of lactic
acid was obtained at very low pH condition, which might be caused
by the stripping effect of sulfuric acid. Kyuchoukov et al.28 found that lactic acid could be stripped from
the loaded organic phase using acid, alkali, or salt. Additionally,
competition extraction was found between the hydrochloric acid and
lactic acid.21 In other words, sulfuric
acid used to regulate pH might be substituted for lactic acid to be
extracted into the organic phase.

Figure 2 Effect of pH on lactic acid extraction
efficiency (A), and on distribution
coefficient and undissociated rate (B) (conditions: 10 min, 25 °C,
O/A = 1, 10 wt %).

As shown in Figure 2, the experimental
data of HDL and THDL showed a similar trend, but
the extraction efficiency of lactic acid in THDL increased by 3.6–32.2%
compared with that of HDL. The maximum value was reached with the
pH value of about 1.6, and the extraction efficiencies of lactic acid
were 83 and 50.8% from THDL and HDL, respectively. At this point,
the existence of lactic acid was mainly undissociated molecules (>99%)
(lactic acid pKa = 3.86). However, when
the pH was close to the pKa of lactic
acid, about half of the lactic acid was dissociated, and only 16.8
and 22.4% lactic acid were extracted from HDL and THDL at pH 3.6,
respectively. Therefore, a relatively low pH of around 1.6 was considered
the optimum extraction condition.

2.4 Effect
of Phase Ratio
The effect
of phase ratio (O/A) on liquid–liquid extraction of lactic
acid was evaluated. The organic phase and HDL or THDL were mixed to
different volume ratios, and the equilibrium data of extraction efficiency
and distribution coefficient of lactic acid are shown in Figure 3. It could be seen
that with increasing value of O/A, the extraction efficiency initially
increased, reached the maximum value at about O/A of 1, and then basically
remained stable. However, the distribution coefficient increased first
and then decreased. This might be because the amount of organic solvent
increased with the increase of O/A, which might have increased the
interaction of lactic acid and the extractant, but at the same time,
the decrease in the concentration of the acid–amine complex
led to the reduction of the distribution coefficient. Compared with
the HDL, the increase of extraction efficiency and distribution coefficient
of lactic acid from THDL was significant. Operating at an O/A of 1:2,
the maximum distribution coefficient was reached, and 76.8 and 43.5%
lactic acid were extracted from THDL and HDL, respectively. For the
best extraction performance, it was favorable and feasible to choose
the O/A of 1:1, where the maximum extraction efficiency was reached
and had a relatively high distribution coefficient of lactic acid.
Further increase of O/A was useless for improving the extraction efficiency,
and the distribution coefficient was sharply diminished. This meant
that a large amount of organic solvent had been consumed when the
phase ratio was further increased, but no further positive effect
was achieved, which also led to a huge waste of organic solvent.

of phase ratio on lactic acid extraction efficiency (A)
and distribution coefficient (B) (conditions: 10 min, 25 °C,
pH = 1.6, 10 wt %).

2.5 Effect
of the Salting-Out Extraction Step
The reaction liquor is
a complex mixture system. In the extraction
process, the competition extraction or interaction of other substances
in the solution occurred frequently, which might have further influenced
the distribution coefficient and extraction efficiency of lactic acid.
By extracting lactic acid from simulated fermentation broth, Yankov
et al.48 found that acetate in the solution
could affect the extraction process. San-Martín et al.49 found that when ions were present, less lactic
acid was extracted using Alamine 336 as the extractant.

In this
work, a salting-out extraction step was introduced into the recovery
process to treat the corn stover hemicellulose-derived liquor for
reducing the influence of impurities in the feedstock. Due to the
presence of inorganic salt in the salting-out extraction system, water
molecules were attracted by the salt ions and then departed from organic
solvent molecules. Therefore, a two-phase system was obtained, which
led to selective extraction of the substrate from the bottom phase
to the top phase.36 It reduced the complexity
of the corn stover hemicellulose-derived liquor. As we can see in Table 1, 82.8% ions were
removed compared with that in HDL, and no residual sugars were detected
in THDL. From the results of the above three sets of parallel experiments,
it could be found that the reactive extraction performance significantly
increased by introducing the salting-out extraction step in the recovery
process. This was because the salting-out extraction step effectively
removed hydrophilic impurities, thus reducing the mass transfer resistance
of the reactive extraction process and promoting the transfer of lactic
acid to the organic phase. It was concluded that the complexity of
the product usually restricted the mass transfer, which made the extraction
inefficient. If the salting-out and reactive extraction processes
are combined, the recovery of lactic acid would be simpler and more
effective. Therefore, process II was chosen for further investigation.

2.6 Effect of Contact Time and Extraction Temperature
It is well known that the extraction time and temperature can affect
the heat transfer and mass transfer. To investigate the effect of
contact time and extraction temperature on the recovery of lactic
acid from THDL, an equal volume of organic phase (containing 10 wt
% TOA) and THDL was mixed in varying times and temperatures. As shown
in Figure 4A, the extraction
efficiency reached 83% within 10 min. However, with prolonged contact
time, a slight decline could be seen for the distribution coefficient,
which might be caused by the effect of emulsification in long-time
agitation. The result showed that extraction equilibrium was reached
quickly.

Figure 4 Effect of contact time (A) and extraction temperature (B) on recovery
of lactic acid from THDL (conditions: pH = 1.6, O/A = 1, 10 wt %).

Figure 4B shows
the effect of temperature on the extraction of lactic acid from THDL.
The result shows that the temperature slightly affected the distribution
coefficient and extraction efficiency in the range of 15–70
°C, which was consistent with the extraction of lactic acid from
fermentation using Alamine 336 as the extractant.47 As shown in Figure 4B, the increase of liquid viscosity at low temperature might
be not conducive to mass transfer. On increasing the extraction temperature
to 25 °C, the maximum distribution coefficient of lactic acid
was obtained, which then decreased slowly with further increase in
extraction temperature. It is obvious that the process of extracting
lactic acid was exothermic using tertiary amine as the extractant,
and rising temperature was not conducive to extraction. In addition,
the lactic acid–amine complex might be unstable at elevated
temperatures.50 Furthermore, at high temperature,
the solvent loss would increase because of increased solubility and
volatility, and the process of regulation of temperature was energy
consuming, which could increase the production costs. Therefore, 25
°C (room temperature) and contact time of 10 min seemed to be
a good choice.

2.7 Multistage Extraction
To further
improve the extraction efficiency, multistep extraction was performed
to recover lactic acid from THDL. Sequential extraction steps (one,
two, three, and four) were performed at O/A values of 1:1 and 1:2. Figure 5 shows the accumulated
extraction efficiency of lactic acid with different extraction steps.
Operating at O/A of 1:2, the extraction efficiency of one-step extraction
was 76.8%. After performing a second extraction, 84.4% lactic acid
was obtained. When the O/A was 1:1, the experimental results showed
that the observed trend was consistent with that for O/A of 1:2, that
is, 89.4% extraction efficiency of lactic acid could be obtained by
two-step extraction, which was slightly higher than 83% of one-step
extraction. However, as Figure 5 shows, the third- and fourth-step extraction could not significantly
increase the recovery of lactic acid in comparison with two-step extraction.
This might be because an equilibrium between the two phases was achieved
after two-step extraction. According to the experimental results,
two-step extraction at O/A of 1:2 achieved almost the same performance
of lactic acid extraction as one-step extraction at O/A of 1:1, but
these results were slightly lower than that of two-step extraction
at O/A of 1:1. To obtain high extraction performance and solvent utilization
at the same time with convenient operation, one-step extraction seemed
to be a good choice when O/A was 1:1.

Figure 5 Effect of sequential extraction steps
on recovery of lactic acid
from THDL (conditions: 25 °C, 10 min, pH = 1.6, 10 wt %).

2.8 Stripping
and Repeated Experiments
The stripping of carboxylic acid
from the loaded organic phase and
recycling of the extraction system are vital parts of the recovery
process.51 Since lactic acid is easily
available in the market, distillation is an effective method used
to strip lactic acid from the organic phase after extraction. However,
in the present work, the boiling points of TOA and octanol were high,
which made it difficult to be distilled at atmospheric pressure. The
alternative method was back-extraction. It turned the extracted lactic
acid into downstream chemical products, such as sodium lactate, which
could be used in pharmaceuticals (e.g., dialysis) and could be further
converted into lactic acid.

In the present work, the extracted
lactic acid in the organic phase was stripped via back-extraction.
After loading with lactic acid, the loaded organic phase was mixed
with sodium hydroxide of different concentrations for 30 min at 25
°C and the phase ratio of 1. Sodium hydroxide reacted with lactic
acid in the acid–amine complex to form sodium lactate, and
subsequently the extraction phase was regenerated. The results in Table 2 show that the efficiency
of stripping lactic acid using NaOH was very effective, which increased
with the increase of NaOH concentration. Within 0.4 g L–1 of NaOH concentration, only 20% lactic acid could be stripped, and
the degree of stripping could reach 99.5% when the concentration of
NaOH was increased to 6 g L–1. The lactic acid stripped
from the load phase entered the aqueous phase, and the organic phase
was collected for the next run through a simple phase separation.

Table 2 Effect of the Concentration of NaOH
on Stripping Lactic Acid from the Loaded Organic Phase (Conditions:
25 °C, 30 min, O/A = 1)
no	CNaOH (g L–1)	stripping degree (ε) (%)	distribution coefficient (KD)

3	1.6	52	0.91	
4	3	70	0.42	
5	6	99.5	0.005	
To verify
the extraction performance of the regenerated organic
solvent after back-extraction, the regenerated organic phase was reused
for the next extraction operation. The results of five repeated experiments
are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the extraction efficiency of lactic acid remained
about 83% for the five cycling times in the condition of O/A of 1.
This result showed that the extraction system could be recycled. Thus,
the feasibility of using reactive liquid–liquid extraction
for the recovery of lactic acid from THDL had been confirmed.

reuse of extractant on recovery of lactic acid from
THDL (conditions: 10 min, 25 °C, pH = 1.6, O/A = 1, 10 wt %).

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated
that the introduction of the
salting-out extraction step had an excellent effect on the recovery
of lactic acid from the mixture derived from corn stover by liquid–liquid
reactive extraction. The extraction performance of the reactive extraction
process could be significantly affected by the concentration of TOA,
pH value, and the value of O/A. At the optimum extraction condition,
the extraction efficiency and distribution coefficient of lactic acid
in THDL were 83.0% and 4.88, respectively, which were 32.2% and 3.85
times higher than that of HDL, respectively. The marked increase in
extraction performance was attributed to the salting-out extraction
step in the novel process, which could remove most of the salts (82.8%)
and almost all of the residual sugars in HDL. Moreover, multistage
extraction could be more effective, and 89.3% lactic acid could be
extracted from THDL by two-step extraction at the phase ratio of 1:1.
The lactic acid in the load organic phase could be stripped using
sodium hydroxide solution via one-step back-extraction, whereas the
extraction system was regenerated and directly used for the next run
by a simple phase separation. Five repeated experiments showed that
the extraction system still exhibited stable performance. Thus, it
is considered that the present work might provide a promising method
for the recovery of lactic acid from hemicellulose-derived liquor
of the actual biomass.

4 Material and Methods
4.1 Materials
The chemical catalytic
conversion of hemicellulose to lactic acid has been reported previously,
and the chemical composition of the initial reaction liquor is shown
in Table 1.4 The activated carbon used was provided from Adamas
(Shanghai, China), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area, pore volume, and pore size of which were 1732 m2 g–1, 1.16 cm3 g–1, and 26.7
Å, respectively. Lactic acid standard solution was derived from
commercial lactic acid (95%, Enamine) and then diluted with deionized
water. Trioctylamine (TOA, 98%) and octanol (99%) were purchased from
TCI (Shanghai, China). Analytical-grade sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide,
sodium chloride, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained from Kelong
Chemical Reagent (Chengdu, Sichuan, China). All of the reagents and
solvents were used directly from commercial sources without further
purification.

4.2 Activated Carbon Treatment
The initial
reaction liquor directly derived from corn stover was mixed with activated
carbon at room temperature with stirring for 3 h. The dosage of activated
carbon was 2%. Then, the HDL was collected after filtration with a
Nylon 66 membrane with a pore size of 0.22 μm for removing large
particles and impurities.

4.3 Studied Processes for Recovery
of Lactic Acid
The flow sketch of the processes of lactic
acid recovery is shown
in Figure 7. Two processes,
that is, process I and process II, were studied comparatively. For
process I, TOA was dissolved in octanol to obtain the organic phase
extractant, and then the required amount of the organic phase extractant
and HDL was added to centrifuge tubes. The two-phase system was stirred
at constant temperature by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm to mix the
two phases. The extraction time and temperature were varied from 5
to 40 min and 15 to 70 °C, respectively. Then, the stirrer was
stopped, and the hybrid system was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min
to assist in separation of organic and aqueous phases. After phase
separation, the concentration of lactic acid in raffinate was analyzed
immediately. For the stripping experiment, the loaded organic phase
was allowed to come in contact with sodium hydroxide solution in a
centrifuge tube. The extraction time and temperature were 30 min and
25 °C, respectively. The followed treatment and analysis processes
were consistent with the above extraction experiment.

Figure 7 Schematic flowsheet of
recovery processes.

Process II was proposed
by adding a salting-out extraction step
between the simple activated carbon treatment and the reactive extraction.
THF/NaCl, as the salting-out extraction system, was employed in this
procedure. Compared to the conventional ethanol salting-out extraction
system,46 THF had a lower boiling point
and stronger volatility, which could be removed more easily. The process
was as follows: first, the pH of the filtrate was regulated to 1.4
by adding a diluted sulfuric acid, and then sodium chloride was added.
The weight ratio of filtrate to sodium chloride was 3:1. Second, tetrahydrofuran
was added, and the separatory funnel was shaken for 5 min; then, the
top phase was collected, and this operation was repeated five times.
Finally, the collected top phase was evaporated to remove THF and
then diluted to the initially added HDL volume by deionized water
to obtain THDL to make a little difference in the concentration of
lactic acid between THDL and HDL. The followed processes of liquid–liquid
reactive extraction of lactic acid from THDL were consistent with
that from HDL described above.

4.4 Analysis
The quantitative analysis
of lactic acid was performed by HPLC using Shimadzu liquid chromatography
(column: MCIGEL CRS10W 50 × 4.6 mm) with a UV detector whose
wavelength was set at 254 nm. The mobile phase was a 1 mM copper sulfate
aqueous solution with flow rate of 0.3 mL min–1.
The detection temperatures of the column and the UV detector were
35 and 40 °C, respectively. In addition, the HPX-87 analytical
column was used to analyze simultaneously the sugar and sugar degradation
products in liquid samples, and the column was maintained at 50 °C
with a 5 mM H2SO4 eluent at a flow rate of 0.6
mL min–1. The external standard method was adopted
to quantify the products using calibration curves from standard samples
(e.g., lactic acid), which was based on the functional relationship
between the response value of the standard sample and the concentration
of the standard substance to calculate the concentration of the detected
component in the unknown samples. Inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was applied to analyze the ion content
of the samples. All experiments were performed three times, and the
relative deviations were found to be within 1.5%. The graph showed
the average of three experimental data.

The concentration of
lactic acid transferred to the organic phase was calculated by a mass
balance (eq 1). According
to the concentration of lactic acid in the organic and aqueous phases,
the distribution coefficient (KD) can
be defined as the ratio of lactic acid concentration in the organic
phase to that in the aqueous phase, which could be calculated by eq 2. 1   2  The
phase ratio (O/A) can be defined as the
ratio of volume of the organic phase to that of the aqueous phase. 3  The extraction efficiency
(E) can be defined as the ratio of lactic acid mass
in the organic
phase to that in the aqueous phase, which could be calculated by eq 4. 4  The undissociated rate (I) of lactic
acid can be calculated using eq 5. 5  where [LA]aq and Vaq represent the concentration
of lactic acid and the
volume of the aqueous phase, respectively. [LA]org and Vorg represent the concentrations of lactic acid
and the volume of the organic phase, respectively. Subscripts “initial”
and “eq” represent the initial and equilibrium states,
respectively.
