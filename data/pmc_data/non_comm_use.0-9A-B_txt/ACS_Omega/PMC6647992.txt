A fractionation method
for technical lignin was developed, combining
organic solvent extraction and membrane ultrafiltration of the solvent
soluble component. This method was validated on a commercial wheat
straw/Sarkanda grass lignin (Protobind 1000) using 2-butanone (MEK)
as the solvent for both the extraction and the ultrafiltration operations.
The parent lignin and the different obtained fractions were fully
characterized in terms of chemical composition and physicochemical
properties by gel permeation chromatography, gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS), pyrolysis-GC/MS, total phenol contents, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR), thermogravimetric
analysis, differential scanning calorimetry analysis, and Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy. The results show that the proposed process
allows a straightforward recovery of the different lignin fractions
as well as a selective control over their molecular mass distribution
and related dependent properties. Moreover, the operating flexibility
of the Soxhlet/ultrafiltration process allows the treatment of lignins
from different feedstocks using the same installation just by modulating
the choice of the solvent and the membrane porosity with the best
characteristics. This is one of the most important features of the
proposed strategy, which represents a new fractionation approach with
the potential to improve lignin valorization for materials science
and preparative organic chemistry applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lignin
is a complex methoxylated phenylpropane polymeric mixture
which represents 15–33% of the cell wall of terrestrial plants.1,2 Technical lignin is usually obtained as waste byproduct of the cellulose
industry, mainly in paper and biofuel production.3−5 The structure
and physicochemical properties of lignin are strongly dependent on
its natural origin, on the extraction and the fractionation methods
used especially in terms of heterogeneity and molecular size distribution.6,7 Although lignin represents a highly abundant aromatic feedstock
with potentially attractive applications from an economic and ecological
point of view, thermovalorization seems currently to be the most common
exploitation strategy for this cheap and highly available biomass,
as up to now around 95% of lignin produced worldwide every year is
burnt for energy recovery, typically at the pulping plant itself.8 The industrial use of lignin is limited because
of its very complex and bulky structure, its high heterogeneity, and
its intrinsic recalcitrance, and only a small amount of the produced
biomass is currently utilized as raw industrial material.9,10 The main pathways for lignin valorization typically aim for the
production of materials including its use as a filler, in blend with
polymers, as a copolymer, and as a water-reducing agent for concrete,
allowing its direct exploitation without requiring a preliminary depolymerization
step after the original biomass fractionation.11−16

In the production of both chemicals and materials, the full
exploitation
potential of lignin is strictly related to the availability of efficient
and viable depolymerization processes in order to obtain low molecular
weight aromatics and building blocks for their further incorporation
in higher added value biobased compounds.17,18 This critical process is mainly hindered by the intrinsic lignin
resistance to degradation, therefore requiring strong chemical or
thermochemical deconstruction methods such as pyrolysis, chemical
oxidation, hydrogenolysis, gasification, and hydrolysis under supercritical
conditions.19,20 As a suitable alternative, biocatalytic
methods are currently investigated because they allow the use of mild
conditions and greener reagents.21−24

Despite the potential interest
in these valorization approaches,
some obstacles to an efficient use of technical lignins for high-value-added
applications remain, mainly resulting from their inherent high molecular
mass dispersion because of the different biomass fractionation processes
used for biomass delignification. The molecular weight of technical
lignins plays a fundamental role in their valorization, and the availability
of lignins with well-defined mass ranges appears as the key requirement
for the whole exploitation of this valuable resource. Within this
framework, we recently set up a method of fractionation of a soda
pulp lignin with membrane-assisted ultrafiltration in ethanol/water,
which represents a particularly interesting technology because of
its high separation efficiency and adaptability to different feeds
and liquors.25 Nevertheless, one major
limitation of this methodology is associated with the poor solubility
of most commercial lignins in water-based solutions, which typically
leads to membrane fouling, potential reduction of processing throughput
because of maintenance for cleaning cycles, and reduction of in-service
membrane life time. Furthermore, the recovery of the final products
requires additional acidification and extraction operations on the
process solutions, resulting in unavoidable mass losses, waste production,
and overall yield reduction that can decrease the industrial interest
despite its attractiveness due to the use of the environmental friendly
water/ethanol mixture.

To bridge this gap, this work presents
a new lignin fractionation
method based on an initial Soxhlet-mediated extraction of a commercial
technical lignin in the organic solvent, directly followed by membrane-assisted
cascade ultrafiltrations on the solvent soluble component. It is worth
noting that a combined organosolv-ultrafiltration approach for the
delignification of non-woody lignocellulosic biomass has been described
previously in a biorefinery process.26 In
the present work, the focus is on obtaining lignin fractions with
controlled properties and on assessing the process performance on
the basis of the characteristics of such lignin fractions, which were
fully analyzed in terms of their chemical, physical, thermal and structural
properties. The approach presented in this study demonstrates a straightforward
process to obtain lignin fractions with tailored characteristics using
an industrially relevant and toxicologically benign organic solvent
with the possibility to be recyclable in a closed circuit plant, in
view of a potential reduction of environmental concerns and process
costs. In addition, it provides important insights into the structure–property
relationships of the resulting materials in view of their potential
further exploitation for the development of biobased polymers and
chemicals.

2 Results and Discussion
The main goal
of this work was to describe a general extraction/mass
fractionation process applicable to technical lignins in order to
exploit their whole valorization potential by separating the starting
raw materials in well-defined and narrowly dispersed molecular size
fractions. The fractionation process based on an initial Soxhlet extraction
with the organic solvent followed by a membrane-mediated ultrafiltration
was carried out in this study on a representative technical lignin
(Protobind 1000), using 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK) as the
extraction solvent (due to its industrial relevance and its favorable
toxicological profile). The selection of a commercially available
herbaceous lignin material for this study reflects the great impact
of non-woody, agricultural, and crop-derived biomass on the global
biobased economy both in terms of economic turnaround and mass availability.27

2.1 Solvent Selection
The selection of
a suitable solvent for Soxhlet lignin extraction is a key step for
the whole process. The extraction efficiency of Protobind 1000 was
tested for a series of six different organic solvents, namely tetrahydrofuran
(THF), methanol (MeOH), MEK, ethylacetate (EtOAc), n-butylacetate (BuOAc), and tert-butyl methyl ether
(MTBE). The extraction yields are reported in Table 1 together with results obtained from gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis on the extracted solutions
expressed as number average molecular weight (Mn), weight average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (Đ).

The highest
extraction yields were obtained with THF, MeOH, and
MEK as the extracting solvents. In order to achieve an efficient recovery
of the higher molecular mass components (and enhance the overall process
yields), it is thus mandatory to select a solvent with high extraction
capability. This is also confirmed from GPC data that demonstrate
an evident shift toward low molecular mass values of solutions with
low extraction yields. In the present study, MEK was selected considering
other aspects such as easy evaporation, low viscosity of the extracts
(to avoid clogging in filtration membranes), good recyclability, uncritical
handling, and low toxicity. It is important, however, to emphasize
that this is not to be considered a general indication because technical
lignins can have very different solubility behaviors as a result of
the specific delignification process used for their recovery and of
the biomass origin. To provide a comparative example, the solubility
of another commercial lignin (softwood Kraft lignin) was determined
for the same solvent series and the results are reported in the Supporting Information. In this case, the best
solvent seems to be methanol. The operating flexibility of the Soxhlet/ultrafiltration
process, which allows to treat lignins from very different sources
using the same installation just by modulating the choice of the most
suitable solvent from a broad range of possibilities, is one of the
most important features of the proposed strategy.

2.2 Fractionation Process
The sequential
process of solvent extraction and mass fractionation of technical
lignins is reported in Figure 1. It represents the basis of an idealized total valorization
process (including the downstream depolymerization and purification/upgrading
operations that are not part of the present study). An essential part
of the whole process concept is the recovery of the outcome lignin
fractions by solvent evaporation and recycle (not illustrated here
for clarity).

Figure 1 Overview of the fractionation process depicted as basis
for an
idealized total lignin valorization workflow (plain line: fractionation
process, dashed line: downstream potential use of the isolated fractions;
solvent recycling pathway not illustrated).

The first step of the process is a Soxhlet solvent extraction
of
the target technical lignin (LF-0). MEK was selected as the suitable
organic solvent and the initial concentration in the extractor loading
was 105 g/L. The Soxhlet extraction allowed the transfer of the soluble
components of the starting lignin to the liquid phase, leaving the
impurities as the solid residual matter. The desired compounds dissolved
in the warm solvent were concentrated in the collecting flask. The
solvent reflux was kept for 8 h. From the Soxhlet extraction, an insoluble
solid residual fraction (LF-I) and a soluble extracted fraction (LF-S)
were recovered. LF-S was then directly submitted to the downstream
cascade ultrafiltration process: the first ultrafiltration step (with
membrane cutoff of 5 kDa) generated two fractions, LF-R5 (retentate)
and LF-P5 (permeate). This latter was processed with a second ultrafiltration
step (with a 2 kDa cutoff membrane) to give LF-R2 (retentate) and
finally LF-P2 (permeate). The mass yields after the different steps
(obtained from solvent evaporation) were reported in Table 2. As it appears clearly from
these data, the overall mass balance of the process was close to 75%.

a LF-S and LF-P5 are intermediate
fractions not recovered in the nominal process.

Process parameters were optimized
for the selected solvent (MEK)
as previously described (see Materials and Methods and Supporting Information for details).
The Soxhlet repeatability was assessed performing 20 extraction operations
in the optimized process conditions, obtaining ±1.7% maximum
deviation of the extraction yields. Furthermore, unlike what recently
reported with aqueous solutions,25 the
use of MEK allowed to work with very high lignin concentrations starting
solutions (105 g/L vs 15 g/L) and also prevented the fouling of the
stabilized cellulose-based membranes during ultrafiltration. Indeed,
the filtration procedure was repeated up to 10 complete consecutive
cycles, maintaining a very stable area-specific air diffusion rate
through the membranes.

The obtained mass fractionation products,
with particular reference
to fractions LF-R5, LF-R2 and LF-P2, were fully characterized by GPC,
gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS), Py-GC/MS, phenol titration, 31P NMR, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The LF-I
fraction (solid residual of Soxhlet extraction) was not further characterized
because, although being a fully legitimate process outcome, it was
not considered relevant in this context.

2.3 Mass
Distribution Based on GPC
In
order to evaluate the effect of the combined solvent fractionation
and ultrafiltration steps on the molecular weights and molecular weight
distribution of the technical lignin considered in this work, GPC
was performed on all fractions in order to obtain the characteristic
values of number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (Đ). Analyses
were performed using monodispersed polystyrene standards as the reference.
The chromatograms of all analyzed materials are reported in Figure S3, and the numerical results are listed
in Table 3.

a Samples have been eluted after acetylation.
The reported values for molecular weights are relative to polystyrene
standards.

The preliminary
solvent-assisted extraction process allows the
recovery of the first soluble fraction LF-S with a slightly narrower
molecular weight distribution compared to that found in the parent
lignin LF-0 (Đ = 2.4 and 3.3 for LF-S and LF-0,
respectively). Similarly, upon ultrafiltration through a 5 kDa membrane,
the retentate fraction LF-R5 shows a further slight reduction in Đ, resulting from a decrease in Mw. These results are in line with the extraction/recovery
yields presented in Table 2, where LF-R5 was found to account for approximately 90% of
the soluble fraction recovered after MEK extraction. This trend indicates
that such soluble fraction is relatively homogenous in terms of molecular
size, and can therefore be potentially exploited as the starting material
for lignin-based polymers. Conversely, the permeate fraction LF-P5
(that accounts for approximately 9% of the total mass of the parent
material) is found to possess a significantly reduced Mn and Mw compared with LF-0
(770 and 1180 g/mol vs 1390 and 4660 g/mol, respectively). This evidence
indicates that the first membrane-assisted ultrafiltration step (5
kDa cutoff) enables the recovery of a permeate fraction enriched in
lower molecular weight molecules that can be further considered as
a potential source of valuable biobased small molecules (as will be
further discussed in the next sections). It is worth noticing that
by further processing, the resulting permeate fraction LF-P5
through a 2 kDa membrane, an additional reduction in Mn and Mw can be achieved along
with a significant narrowing of Đ, ultimately
leading to values of 570, 700 g/mol, and 1.2, respectively. Based
on these results, the proposed multistep fractionation process appears
to be very effective in narrowing the molecular weight distribution
of the obtained fractions and more generally in allowing easy and
precise control of the molecular weight of the starting material.

The mass fractionation results were compared with a further test
(process B) carried out by fractionating the same technical lignin
(Protobind 1000) in an aqueous solvent (ethanol/basic water 60:40
v/v) with a different first stage process (0.7 μm membrane microfiltration
instead of the Soxhlet extraction), as we described in a previous
work with different membranes.25Figure 2 reports Mw, Mn, and Đ of the output isolated fractions (LF-R5, LF-R2,
and LF-P2) obtained in both process conditions. In this case, we expected
a different size distribution for the first, heavier fractions (here
LF-R5) because of the modified solvent and first-stage process that
result in a different extracted quantity of high molecular mass material
(i.e., the most critical to be solubilized and thus the most sensible
to the extraction process parameters).

Figure 2 Mn, Mw,
and Đ values obtained via GPC analysis on the
output isolated fractions (LF-R5, LF-R2, and LF-P2) recovered upon
treating lignin with the process described in this work (MEK) and
with a different fractionation process (B) based on the ethanol/basic
water solvent and the microfiltration first stage (see text for details).

On the other hand, the results
of the lower molecular weight fractions
appeared to be quite similar, proving that the impact of the solvent
and of the first step of the process (microfiltration vs. Soxhlet
extraction) is most critical for the higher MW fractions. Moreover,
the data also confirm that the filtration membranes performance is
not affected by the solvent used, indicating a good independence between
the extraction operation (controlled by the solvent) and the downstream
fractionation (controlled by the ultrafiltration membrane). This is
a very important feature from an industrial scale-up perspective because
it allows an easy process optimization with different lignins (e.g.,
soda vs Kraft pulping).

It is worth it to point out that the
accurate determination of
the molecular weight of lignin samples has been widely discussed in
the literature.28−30 In particular, it is widely acknowledged that the
molecular weight determination by GPC analysis only provides a relative
quantification of the mass distribution with respect to the standard
used for GPC calibration. In this work, monodisperse polystyrene standards
were employed for GPC calibration, in line with common practice in
this field. In this respect, unavoidable structural differences between
the most commonly employed polymer standards (typically linear polymers)
and lignin macromolecules (known to be highly branched) are a very
well-known source of error in the determination of molecular weight.31,32 Based on these considerations, it is not uncommon to find limited
correspondence between the cut-off dimensions of the membranes used
for the ultrafiltration process in lignin fractionation and the average
molecular weights found by means of GPC analysis on the resulting
lignin fractions, with membrane cut-off dimensions frequently overestimating
the obtained molecular weight values with respect to GPC.33−36 Therefore, the molecular weight characterization of the obtained
lignin fractions is to be intended as a proof of the beneficial effect
of membrane-assisted ultrafiltration in isolating lignins with decreasing
the molecular weight and polydispersity as the membrane cut-off decreases.

2.4 Determination of Hydroxylation Levels
2.4.1 Phenolic Hydroxyl Group Determination
Folin−Ciocalteu
(FC) assay has been carried out to determine
the total phenolic content in the original lignin and all process
fractions. It is based on the reaction of phenolic hydroxyl groups
with a specific redox reagent (FC reagent) which leads to the formation
of a blue chromophore which is however sensitive and unstable in strong
bases.37 Therefore, in this work, dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) was used as the solvent for the samples in order to obtain
complete sample solubilization in neutral conditions.

The results
are reported in Table 4 as gallic acid equivalents (GAEs, μg gallic acid per mL of
working solution) and as total phenolic content in mmol phenolic groups
per g of lignin. It is worth noting that with the FC method, only
two phenolic groups of gallic acid are reactive, so one GAE must be
considered as two phenolic group equivalents.38 LF-P2 appeared to be the fraction with a higher content in phenolic
hydroxyl groups as it will be confirmed below with 31P
NMR experiments.

2.4.2 Total Hydroxyl Groups Quantification with 31P NMR
Analysis
In the last years, 31P
NMR constitutes the most recognized method for the quantification
of hydroxyl groups in lignins because the use of the phosphorylating
agent 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3-2-dioxaphospholane leads to
the complete phosphorylation of all the OH-groups present in the analyzed
samples.39 Furthermore, the clear differentiation
in chemical shifts of aliphatic, aromatic, and carboxylic groups allows
their quantification using an internal standard as the reference (here, N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid diimide). Figure 3 shows a comparison
of the 31P NMR spectra of the starting material LF-0 with
the different fractions obtained in the process of fractionation,
allowing to distinguish the different hydroxyl groups present in the
lignin backbone.

Figure 3 31P NMR spectra of lignin fractions.

In detail, the region between
151 and 146 ppm represents the aliphatic
hydroxyl groups, whereas the region between 145 and 138 ppm accounts
for the aromatic hydroxyl groups. The signals of carboxylic acids
groups are centered on 136 ppm. The peak integration in the three
main portions of the spectrum leads to the quantification of the total
hydroxyl groups as reported in Table 5.

Table 5 Detailed Hydroxyl/Carboxyl Quantification

lignin	–OH aliphatic [mmol/g]	–OH phenolic [mmol/g]	–COOH [mmol/g]	
LF-0	1.83	3.54	0.92	
LF-S	0.74	3.29	0.66	
LF-R5	1.24	4.19	0.09	
LF-R2	1.27	4.52	1.29	
LF-P2	1.48	5.2	1.52	
Both FC assay and 31P NMR data indicate a slight phenolic
hydroxyls increment in the lower MW fractions LF-R2 and LF-P2. 31P NMR data indicate that this trend is extended also to the
aliphatic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups.

2.4.3 GC/MS
Results
The distribution
of small molecules such as aromatic monomers and aliphatic carboxylic
acids isolated from the different fractions was determined by GC/MS.
The analyzed samples were prepared with a small scale chromatography
on silica gel in order to eliminate all the polymeric/oligomeric fractions
and to recover only the suitable fraction for GC/MS analysis (% of
mass recovered after chromatography are reported in Table 6). It is clearly noticeable
that, going through the fractionation process, the percentages are
congruent with the composition of each fraction. In particular, LF-R5
which is the higher MW retentate contains only 7% of small molecules
which can be analyzed by GC/MS, whereas LF-P2 which is the last permeate
of the process is considerably enriched in small molecules (63%).

The results are reported in Figure 4 and Table 6 and describe the distribution

present in each fraction: they are divided into three main classes
such as benzaldehydes and acetophenone derivatives (ArCHO, ArCOR),
benzoic and coumaric acids (ArCOOH, ArCHCHCOOH), and aliphatic long
chain carboxylic acids (RCOOH). The distribution trends highlighted
in Table 6 confirm
the efficacy of the fractionation procedure, as the percentages of
total monomers in each sample increases when proceeding through the
process, passing from 14% (w/w) of monomers in the analyzed higher
molecular weight fraction LF-R5 to a maximum of 47% (w/w) in the lower
molecular weight fraction LF-P2.

The chromatogram profiles of the different fractions
and the structures
of the most abundant identified compounds are reported in Figure 4, where the enrichment
in smaller MW products clearly appears when moving throughout the
fractionation process, from fraction LF-S to fraction LF-P2 as the
number of peaks in the chromatogram becomes much more relevant. The
complete characterization of all peaks is reported in the Supporting Information.

2.4.4 Pyrolysis-GC/MS
Py-GC/MS represents
a very useful tool for lignin structure elucidation.40,41 The so-called pulsed pyrolysis offers a wide temperature range for
the applied pyrolysis temperature by platinum resistive heating in
comparison to a Curie point pyrolysator.42 The aim of the pyrolysis evaluation in lignin is to see if changes
in the so-called S-/G-/H-units distribution of the obtained fractions
occurred going through the fractionation sequence. Py-GC/MS of lignin
results usually in different phenolic compounds with p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) aromatic moieties
with or without alkyl substituents.

The aromatic (H), (G), and
(S) moieties differ in the amount of methoxy groups (zero, one, or
two groups, respectively). Depending on the pyrolysis conditions,
the methoxy groups may be largely unaffected and the distribution
of pyrolysates from each of the monomers in the liquid fraction may
reflect the relative abundance of the monomers in the starting feedstock.
Therefore, it is possible to measure the S/G ratio in lignin polymers
based on pyrolysate distributions. For the pyrolysis, two potential
temperatures were selected after a TGA of the lignins LF-0 and LF-S
(obtained curves are reported in Figure S16). The first one was 600 °C because at this temperature, the
pyrolytic degradation of the lignin stops in the obtained TGA thermograms.
The second one was 450 °C because this value corresponds to the
middle of the degradation process of the samples.

The impact
of the temperature choice is obvious in the two selected
samples. In the case of starting lignin LF-0 and the solvent-extracted
LF-S (Figure 5 panels
A/B, and panels C/D, respectively), the amount of small signals is
reduced and the intensity of other signals became increased at the
lower temperature. This is probably caused by the reduction of secondary
reactions in the gas phase of the pyrolyzed lignin.43,44 Furthermore, the quality of the signals increased at 450 °C.

The identification of the peaks
was performed in combination with
the NIST Database (NIST MS Search 2.0g, data reported in the Supporting Information). The identification was
necessary to assign the (H), (G), and (S) subunits to the obtained
fragments for the determination of the S/G ratio (see Table 7).

changes in the S/G ratio are reported during the different
steps of the filtration process, which is found to decrease with the
size of the ultrafiltration membrane. The pristine material LF-0 exhibits
a S/G ratio of 1.92, whereas in the solvent-extracted LF-S fraction,
S/G is found to reach 1.54. With each filtration step, the ratio goes
down to 1.00. This means that the smaller lignin molecules possess
a different average composition if compared to the raw material or
the bulky fraction and that this fractionation process has a strong
impact on the molecular distribution of the lignin extract, reflected
by the decrease of polydispersity Đ.

2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy was employed to analyze the chemical characteristics
of the lignin fractions recovered after solvent extraction and subsequent
membrane-assisted ultrafiltration. The spectra of each material are
reported in Figure 6 together with the spectrum of the parent materials LF-0.

Figure 6 (a) FTIR spectra
of all lignin fractions analyzed in this work.
(b) Zoom in the 1850–700 cm–1 spectral region.

All samples present the characteristic
peaks of soda-pulp lignin
with clearly identifiable signals in the 3800–2700 and 1850–700
cm–1 spectral regions.45,46 Some differences among the obtained fractions appear upon solvent/membrane-assisted
filtration. In particular, a reduction of the intensity of the −OH
stretching signal at 3390 cm–1 is registered after
Soxhlet extraction compared with the pristine material, as evidenced
in the FTIR spectrum of the recovered soluble fraction LF-S. This
evidence suggests that a decrease in hydroxyl group concentration
is experienced upon solvent extraction, likely due to the poor hydrogen
bonding power of the solubilizing solvent (MEK in this case) toward
lignin macromolecules. Upon filtration through membranes of decreasing
cut off, the signal at 3390 cm–1 is generally found
to be higher for permeate fractions (LF-P5 and LF-P2) than for the
corresponding retentate fractions (LF-R5 and LF-R2). Considering that
permeate fractions are typically characterized by lower molecular
weights (viz., chain lengths) than the corresponding retentate fractions
(as also observed in GPC analysis, Figure S3), these trends observed on FTIR analysis may indicate that shorter
chains are characterized by a lower concentration of −OH groups.
Therefore, in addition to a fine control over the average molecular
weight of the resulting fractions during membrane-assisted ultrafiltration,
a modulation of concentration of reactive groups can also be obtained.

At 1705 cm–1, a clear sharp peak is observed
in all spectra, attributable to the stretching vibration of C=O
bonds in conjugated aldehydes and carboxylic acids. It is observed
that after solvent extraction (LF-S), a notable increase in this signal
is observed compared with the parent material, likely indicating a
higher concentration of carbonyl and carboxylic groups. After ultrafiltration,
a broadening of the signal at 1705 cm–1 toward lower
frequencies is registered, more noticeable for the permeate fraction
recovered downstream of the 2 kDa membrane (LF-P2). This is a further
indication of the enrichment in oxidized species for fractions of
lower molecular weight, as also confirmed by the trends observed on 31P NMR (Figure 3 and Table 5). In
the 1400–1000 cm–1 spectral region, signals
of variable intensity are observed, to be attributed to bending vibrations
of phenolic O–H and aliphatic C–H in methyl groups (1370
cm–1), C–O, C–C, and C–O stretching
vibrations (1270 and 1210 cm–1), C–H in plane
deformations (1125 cm–1), and C–O deformations
in primary (1030 cm–1) alcohols. In general, an
overall reduction of the intensity of such signals is registered after
solvent extraction and ultrafiltration, indicating a decrease of concentration
of the corresponding species in the resulting fractions when compared
with the parent material.

2.6 Thermal Behavior of Lignin
Samples
The thermal transitions in the recovered lignin fractions
were evaluated
by means of DSC analysis and compared with the parent system LF-0.
As evidenced from Figure 7a, where DSC traces of all samples are reported, the solvent
extraction step leads to a notable decrease in glass transition temperature
(Tg) of the recovered material, found
to be 99 °C for LF-S as opposed to 139 °C for LF-0. Considering
the significant decrease of hydroxyl (especially aliphatic) group
concentration experienced by LF-S compared with the parent material
(as observed by means of 31P NMR, Table 5), this reduction in Tg may be associated with an increased mobility of the macromolecular
chains in LF-S resulting from the reduction of intra- and interchain
hydrogen bonding interactions.

Figure 7 (a) DSC traces and (b) TGA thermograms
of all lignin fractions
analyzed in this work (the solid arrow indicates the increase in intensity
of the low-temperature mass loss event, the dashed arrow indicates
the shift of TDTGmax at lower temperatures).

By successive ultrafiltration
of LF-S through the membrane of decreasing
cutoff (5 and 2 kDa, respectively), a further reduction in Tg is observed in the permeate fractions LF-P5
(53 °C) and LF-P2 (50 °C). Conversely, a slightly higher Tg compared with the input material LF-S is found
for the retentate fraction recovered after the first ultrafiltration
(LF-R5, Tg = 114 °C). Such trends
may be correlated with the outcomes of GPC (Figure S3 and Table 3) analyses discussed previously, in which a general decrease of molecular
weight (and reduction of polydispersity) was found in lignin fractions
obtained after filtration through increasingly finer membranes. As
previously observed also on other types of lignin,47 these results highlight the strong dependence of Tg on the molecular weight of lignin.

The
investigation of the thermal stability of the lignin samples
considered in this work was performed by means of TGA measurements
conducted under N2 flow. As shown in Figure 7b, where TGA thermograms (mass loss curves
and corresponding mass loss derivatives) of all lignin fractions are
reported, all systems exhibit a major mass loss event in the 300–450
°C temperature range, which may be attributed to the rupture
of carbon–carbon bonds between lignin structural units and
functional groups.48 In particular, all
fractions exhibit a maximum mass loss derivative temperature (TDTGmax) centered at around 300–400 °C,
which is, however, found to decrease slightly for fractions recovered
after progressively finer membranes. Similarly, a reduction of the
final char residue at 760 °C is also observed. In addition, the
appearance of an additional mass loss event centered at 200 °C
of increasing intensity is reported for such materials, attributable
to the breaking of α- and β- alkyl−aryl−ether
links, aliphatic chains, and decarboxylation reactions. These trends
well correlate with the results from DSC analysis and further confirm
the major impact of the molecular weight on the thermal stability
of lignin, the latter being found to be relatively poorer in lower
molecular weight fractions.

3 Conclusions
Fractionation of an industrial wheat straw/Sarkanda grass lignin
obtained by the soda pulp process was successfully carried out by
means of a new process based on the combination of a Soxhlet solvent
extraction and two sequential membrane-mediated ultrafiltrations.

This reported two-step process represents a valuable approach toward
the optimized valorization of technical lignins, allowing the access
to lignin fractions with well-defined physico-chemical properties
(including mass distribution, Tg, aliphatic
and phenolic hydroxyl groups concentration, syringyl/guaiacyl unit
ratio). Moreover, the use of a solvent like MEK permitted to work
with very high starting lignin concentrations (up to 105 g/L), allowed
the direct coupling of the Soxhlet extraction outcome with the membrane-assisted
ultrafiltration system, prevented fouling of the stabilized cellulose-based
membranes and ultimately led to an easy product recovery by a simple
solvent evaporation step. All these characteristics may enable the
implementation of a scalable approach with potential to reduce environmental
impact and process fractionation costs. The availability of technical
lignin fractions with tailored and reproducible characteristics potentially
allows enhanced lignin valorization strategies to be put in place
for the development of biobased polymers and for the preparation of
key platform chemicals, thereby paving the way for an effective exploitation
of this remarkable resource.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
All chemicals and analytical
grade solvents such as THF, methanol (MeOH), ethylacetate (EtOAc), n-butylacetate (BuOAc), and tert-butyl
methyl ether (MTBE) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-Butanone
(methyl ethyl ketone, MEK) was provided by BCD Chemie GmbH (Hamburg,
Germany). Lignin (Protobind 1000, a mixed wheat straw/Sarkanda grass
lignin from soda pulping of non-woody biomass) was provided by Green
Value (Orbe, Switzerland). Softwood Kraft lignin (Indulin AT) was
provided by Meadwestvaco (USA).

All analyses were carried out
at least in duplicates unless otherwise stated.

4.2 Lignin Solubility in Organic Solvents
Lignin solubility
in the organic solvent was determined treating
10 g of the starting lignin with 100 mL of the solvent stirring at
400 rpm. Each test was carried out overnight at room temperature.
The suspension was then filtered and the solvent was evaporated at
reduced pressure, and the final residue was dried until a constant
weight was achieved prior to quantification.

4.3 Fractionation
Process
The fractionation
process comprises a Soxhlet extraction followed by a two membrane
cascade ultrafiltration (shown in Figure 1 as part of an idealized lignin valorization
scheme) and a final fraction recovery step, as described below (see
also the Results and Discussion section).

4.4 Soxhlet Extraction
Soxhlet extractions
were performed using a standard glass apparatus (Buchi extraction
system B-811) which allows the realization of four extractions at
the same time. Each extraction unit is composed of a 150 mL working
volume bottom solvent flask, a 330 mL capacity thimble holder, and
a water-cooled condenser. For each extraction process, 150 mL of MEK
were placed in the solvent flask and about 15 g of lignin were inserted
inside a 41 mm diameter and 123 mm height cellulose paper thimble
(FiltraTECH). The solvent reflux was kept for 8 h, adjusting the heating
power in order to have 4 extraction cycles/h.

4.5 Membrane
Ultrafiltration
Lignin fractionation
was performed in MEK directly on the Soxhlet extraction solution by
means of an ultrafiltration apparatus (Sartoflow Advanced filtration
module purchased from Sartorius Stedim) equipped with flowmeters and
pressure sensors to control permeate flow, trans-membrane pressure,
and filtration time (see the Supporting Information for details). The membranes (Hydrosart membranes, Sartorius Stedim)
in stabilized cellulose had nominal molecular-weight cutoffs of 5
and 2 kDa and a filtration area of 0.1 m2 each. The membrane
regeneration and storage were performed at 40 °C using 1 and
0.1 M NaOH solution, respectively.

4.6 Fraction
Recovery Procedure
The recovered
fractions from the sequential process of fractionation were evaporated
under reduced pressure without further processing. The final solid
residues were dried until a constant weight was achieved prior to
analysis and quantification.

4.7 Gas Chromatography/Mass
Spectrometry
The GC/MS apparatus used was an Agilent GC System
7890A, with an
inert MSD with the Triple-Axis Detector 7975C. The separation was
performed on a DB-5MS column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25
μm, Phenomenex) with a helium flow rate of 1.18 mL/min, a temperature
program of 50 °C (1 min) to 280 °C at 10 °C/min, 280
°C at 15 min (total run time 39 min, temperature of the injector
250 °C, injection volume 1.00 μL, injection mode split,
split ratio 5:1). A solvent delay of 4 min was selected. The samples
were prepared by derivatization and dissolved in methanol or acetone
in a concentration around 0.5–1 mg/mL as previously described.25 Compound identification was performed by means
of NIST 2008 mass spectral library search.

4.8 Pyrolysis
GC/MS
Py-GC/MS experiments
were conducted using a pyrolysis unit (GERSTEL PYRO with thermal desorption
unit GERSTEL TDU) which used a pulsed pyrolysis at temperatures ranging
from 350 to 1000 °C coupled with GC/MS Thermo Scientific Trace
1310 with a Thermo Scientific ISQ mass spectrometer using a TG-5SILMS
column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The pyrolysis
of the sample was performed in a quartz tube inside the heating chamber
under the helium atmosphere. The obtained pyrolysis gas was directly
transferred to the GC using a heated transfer line. No concentration
methods such as thermal desorption or cryo focusing were used. About
0.5 mg of lignin particles were loaded into the quartz pyrolysis tube
and the pyrolysis temperature was set to 450 or 600 °C. In the
pulse mode, the sample was placed on a cold pyrolysis probe, which
was rapidly (typically in the milliseconds range) heated to a predetermined
pyrolysis temperature and maintained for 0.33 min at that temperature.
The thermal desorption unit temperature was set to 280 °C like
the transfer temperature. GC column temperature program started at
45 °C for 5 min, followed by a gradient of 4 °C to the final
temperature of 280 °C and held for 15 min.

4.9 Gel Permeation Chromatography
A Waters
510 HPLC system was used equipped with a refractive index detector.
THF was used as the eluent. The analyzed lignin sample (volume 200
μL, concentration 1 mg/mL in THF) was injected into a system
of three columns connected in series (Ultrastyragel HR, Waters—dimensions
7.8 mm × 300 mm) and the analysis was performed at 30 °C
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The GPC system was calibrated against
polystyrene standards in the 102 to 104 g/mol
molecular weight range. To allow complete solubility in the THF eluent,
before the analysis, the parent lignin and the fractions were acetylated
following a standard literature procedure.49 The estimation of the number-average and weight-average molecular
weights of the obtained lignin fractions was performed excluding the
signals related to the solvent (THF) and the solvent stabilizer (butylated
hydroxytoluene), visible at long elution times (>29.5 min).

4.10 FC Assay
Total phenolic contents
of the different fractions were determined by the classical FC method
with some modifications in the sample preparation step.38,50 The samples were prepared by dissolving lignin in DMSO with a final
concentration of 1 mg/mL. DMSO was chosen because it is completely
miscible in water, it allows a complete lignin solubilization and
does not interfere with the FC assay.

For each determination,
5 μL of the working solution (or the standard solution) were
then mixed with 120 μL of deionized water, 125 μL of the
FC reagent (Sigma 47641), and kept for 6 min at r.t. after 30 s of
vortex stirring. Then, after addition of 1.25 mL of 5% sodium carbonate
and mixing, the vial was incubated on a thermoshaker at 40 °C
for 30 min. The reaction mixture absorbance was measured using a UV/vis
spectrophotometer (Jasco V-560) equipped with a temperature-controlled
cuvette holder and a thermostatic water bath (Haake K10). All spectrophotometric
measurements were carried out at 760 nm, 25 °C using a 1 cm optical
path cuvette. Gallic acid was chosen as the reference standard. The
calibration curve has been constructed with nine different gallic
acid solutions in DMSO with concentration in the range 0–800
μg/mL. Each FC assay determination was carried out in triplicate.

4.11 31P NMR Analysis
31P NMR spectroscopic analysis was recorded on a Bruker Instrument
AVANCE400 spectrometer. Acquisition and data treatment were performed
with Bruker TopSpin 3.2 software. The spectra were collected at 29
°C with 4 s acquisition time, 5 s relaxation delay, and 256 scans.
Prior to analysis, samples were dried for 24 h under vacuum and then
derivatized according to a procedure described in the literature with
a few modifications.39 All chemical shifts
reported are related to the reaction product of the phosphorylating
agent with water which gives a signal at 132.2 ppm.

The lignin
sample (40 mg) was completely dissolved in 300 μL of N,N-dimethylformamide. To this solution,
the following components were added: 200 μL of dry pyridine,
100 μL of solution of internal standard (10 mg of endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide (Sigma
226378) dissolved in 0.5 mL of a mixture of pyridine and CDCl3 1.6:1 v/v), 50 μL of solution of the relaxation agent
[5.7 mg of chromium(III)acetylacetonate (Sigma 574082) dissolved in
0.5 mL of a mixture of pyridine and CDCl3 1.6:1 v/v], 100
μL of 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane (Sigma
447536), and at the end, 130 μL of CDCl3.

4.12 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC was performed
on solid-state samples (∼10–15 mg)
by means of a Mettler-Toledo DSC/823e instrument at a scan rate of
20 °C/min under nitrogen flux.

4.13 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
TGA was
carried out on solid-state samples (∼10–15 mg) with
a Q500 TGA system (TA Instruments) from room temperature to 800 °C
at a scan rate of 20 °C/min under nitrogen flow.

4.14 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
of all lignin fractions were recorded in the transmission
mode on films spin-cast onto KBr disks. The analysis was performed
by means of a Nicolet 760-FTIR spectrophotometer at room temperature
in air in the 4000–700 cm–1 wavenumber range
with 64 accumulated scans and a resolution of 2 cm–1.
