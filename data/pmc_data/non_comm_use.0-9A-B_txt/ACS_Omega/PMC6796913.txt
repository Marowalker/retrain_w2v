Aiming
for glycolipid-based vesicles for targeted drug delivery, cationic
Guerbet glycosides with spacered click functionality were designed
and synthesized. The cationic charge promoted the distribution of
the glycolipids during the formulation, thereby leading to homogeneously
small vesicles. The positive surface charge of the vesicles stabilizes
them against unwanted fusion and promotes interactions of the drug
carriers with typical negative charge-dominated target cells. High
bioconjugation potential of the functionalized glycolipids based on
the copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition makes them highly
valuable components for targeted drug delivery systems.

Introduction
Despite the tremendous
diversity of life, manifested in billions of species covering single
and multicellular organisms, cellular processes are highly conserved
through interspecies’ borders. This complicates the search
for medical drugs, because the intended toxic effect on parasite cells
is typically accompanied by unwanted side effects on host cells, constraining
the application field and scope of medical drugs. Limited selectivity
of biological active compounds has, therefore, created growing interest
in a selective delivery to target cells.1,2 This concept
is closely related to the immune response system and associated vaccinations,
which also addresses hostile cells based on their surface topology
rather than specific intracellular processes.

Selective drug
delivery requires, on the one hand, an effective encapsulation of
the biological active compound to avoid unwanted interactions with
nontarget cells and on the other specific interactions of the carrier
to ensure the delivery and subsequent action at the target.3,4 Vesicular assemblies of surfactants have been suggested as effective
drug carriers. Their cell-like membrane provides a good barrier against
unwanted exposure of the drug to nontarget cells. Moreover, they enable
the encapsulation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds in
the aqueous core and the bilayer membrane, respectively, thus making
them universally applicable drug carriers. Incorporation of antigens
for specific biological receptors provides an opportunity to direct
a drug to target cells.5 In order to avoid
a loss of the antigen, strong anchoring on the vesicle is required.
Although this might be achieved by binding the antigen to an anchor
lipid, which is subsequently applied as an additive in the vesicle
formulation, such incorporation is expected to leave almost half of
the antigens ineffective, because they are facing the inside of the
drug carrier rather than the outside. Chemical coupling of functionalized
antigens with complementary functional groups on vesicular assemblies,
on the other side, enables a selective introduction of recognition
domains on the extracellular surface,6,7 as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Conceptual design for
targeted biofunctionalized vesicles.

Vesicles can be obtained with any type of surfactant, provided that
the relative surface areas of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic region
are balanced, hence promoting a lamellar assembly.8 Most commonly applied are anionic surfactants, like fatty
acid salts.9 Besides, natural zwitterionic
lipids, like DPPC and lecithin, have found attention as well.10,11 Due to the presence of ionic charges, the assembly behavior of both,
anionic and zwitterionic, surfactants, is affected by external stimuli.
Of particular relevance are the pH and certain electrolytes.12 While this stimuli response provides opportunities
for easy vesicle formulation, e.g., in pH-induced micelle–vesicle
transformations,13,14 it also constrains their stability.
Higher assembly stability can be obtained with nonionic surfactants.15,16 Of particular interest here are glycolipids,17 which exhibit superior temperature tolerance compared to
industrial ethylene oxide-based compounds. Moreover, their natural
product-like structure ensures better biocompatibility.

Recently,
we have developed vesicular drug carriers based on biantennary glycolipids.18 The double-chain region stabilizes lamellar
assemblies while also providing access to bicontinuous cubic phases,19 which have been associated with membrane fusion
processes.20,21 The bicontinuous cubic phase,
hence, potentially provides an opportunity for the delivery of vesicle
contents to a target cell.

Results and Discussion
Compound Design
In line with our previous work,7 we aimed
for a click-functionalized glycolipid to be applied as a cosurfactant
in lactose-based glycolipid vesicle formulations. The choice of the
base surfactant reflected both economic and stability aspects: Although
glucose is by far the least expensive carbohydrate, glycolipids based
on monosaccharides exhibit unfavorably low HLB (hydrophilic–lipophilic
balance) values if longer alkyl chains are applied. Since longer alkyl chains, however, ensure high
assembly stability owing to a low critical assembly concentration,22,23 a more expensive disaccharide core provides advantages for the vesicle
formulation. With this, background lactose became the resource of
choice. Moreover, previous investigations have shown beneficial interactions
of the axial hydroxyl group in galactosides on the stability of bilayer
assemblies,24 thereby also favoring lactose
over alternative disaccharides like maltose and isomaltose.

In view of the observation that application of ionic cosurfactants
reduces the size for glycolipid vesicles while providing a narrow
size distribution at the same time,18a we
targeted to introduce a charge on the functionalized glycolipid. This
way, the biofunctionalization anchor was expected to facilitate a
favorable vesicle size as well, thereby avoiding the need of another
cosurfactant. Moreover, the charge avoids clustering of the cosurfactants
inside the vesicular assemblies due to repulsive interactions, thereby
ensuring good distribution and accessibility of the anchor. Since
typical target cells for drugs exhibit a negative surface charge,
a cationic imidazolium was selected as an easily accessible building
block. A flexible oligoethylene glycol spacer was chosen to mediate
an effective bioconjugation without steric constraints by the vesicle
surface, while a click chemistry approach, based on the copper-catalyzed
Huisgen azide–alkyne cycloadditon,25−28 was selected for the coupling
of vesicles with receptor antigens. As the latter can be easily functionalized
with reactive propargyl reagents, the complementary azide coupling
function is needed to be introduced on the anchor glycolipid. Considering
the molecular size of the imidazolium ion, we chose to use a glucose
carbohydrate for the anchor surfactant, as this lowers the synthetic
costs. Hydrogen bonding interactions between the carbohydrate cores
of the base glycolipid and the bioconjugation anchor aim to avoid
a potential loss of targeting ligands on the drug carriers. The design
of the functionalized glycolipid anchor is displayed in Figure 2.

the glycolipid core surfactant (A) and the functionalized bioconjugation
anchor (B) for vesicular drug carriers.

Synthesis
The synthesis, as shown in Scheme 1, was based on previously reported Guerbet
glucosides 3 with C12 and C16 hydrophobic
domains.19a,19b These chain lengths were chosen
to enable assembly studies without high material demand on the one
hand and reasonably fast assembly kinetics on the other. Functionalization
of the carbohydrate applied halogenation at C-6, following the established
approach of Hanessian et al.29 The intermediates 4a and 4b were directly subjected to peracetylation
to enable effective purification by chromatography and provided precursors 5a and 5b for the coupling with the imidazole
component. The unsatisfactory yield of only 52% reflected obstacles
for the removal of the triphenylphosphine oxide side product.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme for the Functionalized Anchor Glycolipid
The respective azido-terminated imidazole precursors 9, with varying spacer lengths from two to four ethylene oxide
units, were obtained by nucleophilic substitution from the previously
reported corresponding chlorides 82–84.30−32 The synthesis emphasizes the use of excess dichloride 7 in order to avoid spacer-linked diimidazoles, while application
of low reaction temperatures avoided a bisalkylation of the imidazole.

Coupling of glycoside precursor 5 with imidazole 9 according to the Menschutkin reaction applied heating in
a high boiling nonpolar solvent.33 The
ionic nature of the imidazolium compounds 10 prevents
an effective purification process. Therefore, equivalent reagent quantities
were used, furnishing practically NMR-pure compounds. Final deprotection
by transesterfication provided the functionalized glycolipids 11 in overall yields of about 43% based on the Guerbet glucosides 3.

Contrary to the halogenation of 3, both
the Menschutkin coupling and the deprotection of 10 preceded
in high yields without purification requirement. This is in line with
previous investigations furnishing imidazolium-linked glycosides.14,34 Unexpected loss of compound during the deacetylation probably relates
to adsorption of the cationic compound to the ion exchange resin,
which was applied to remove the sodium methoxide catalyst. It may
be avoided by aminolysis of the esters. However, the removal of the
reaction side product would be more difficult.

Unlike the synthetic
similarity, the compound design of 11 differs substantially
from previously reported alkylimidazolium glycosides.14,34 While all compounds share the structural elements of sugar-based
surfactants incorporating imidazolium cations, in 11,
the imidazolium is not linking the surfactant antipodes. This difference has a tremendous
impact on the surfactant biocompatibility, because it ensures easy
degradability of the surfactant linkage.

Application Studies
Assembly studies with the functionalized glycolipids 11b by systematic surface tension measurements furnished critical aggregation
concentrations (CACs) in the typical magnitude for the C16 chain, i.e., around 10–5 M. The CACs in Table 1 exceed the corresponding
values for glycolipids incorporating equivalent hydrophobic domains
by a factor of about 2.18a,35 This reflects the repulsive
interactions of the surfactant head groups, destabilizing the assemblies.
The minor difference between 11b3 and 11b4 is more likely related to slight differences
in minor nonrecognized impurities, rather than reflecting the difference
in the number of ethylene glycol units inside the spacer.

Lyotropic
studies of the surfactants by contact penetration with water36 provided no visible textures under the optical
polarizing microscope. In view of observed good water solubility,
it was concluded that the surfactants only assemble in micelles; hence,
the CAC was specified as critical micelle concentration (CMC). The
absence of any anisotropic lyotropic phase is in contradiction to
the behavior of the corresponding nonionic glucoside 3b.19c However, it is in line with the increased
CAC; the repulsive interactions of the surfactant head groups do not
only reduce the assembly stability but also increase the effective
interfacial surface area of the head group. This is reflected in a
moderate increase in the determined molecular surface area of about
10% with respect to nonionic alkyl glucosides.37,38 The imbalance of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains in terms
of their respective surface areas leads to a conical shape of the
surfactant, which promotes curved assembly geometries like micelles.39

While the pure cationic glycolipids 11 did not exhibit any anisotropic texture in contact with
water, mixtures with dominating contents of the nonionic lactose-based
Guerbet glycoside 12 showed high affinity for the aqueous
lamellar phase, as indicated by extensive formation of myelin figures.
Unlike for the solely β-anomeric 11, the base surfactant 12 was applied as a mixture of anomers.18a,35 This approach provides access to the synthetic product without chromatographic
purification,40 thereby enhancing the economic
viability.

Vesicles were prepared using the ethanolic
injection method.41 Application of 5–10%
of the cationic glycolipid 11b leads to the expected
reduction of the vesicle size, as shown in Table 2. Moreover, the zeta potential of the vesicles
confirmed a change in the surface charge, thereby proving the successful
incorporation of the ionic cosurfactant. Regardless of the anionic
or cationic character, the increased surface charge with respect to
pure glycolipid vesicles enhances the stability of the vesicular assemblies
owing to repulsive interactions of aggregates, constraining assembly
fusions according to Oswald ripening.42 In fact, the vesicle dimensions remained practically unchanged upon
storage for several days in a refrigerator.

In order to evaluate the efficiency of the click coupling
on vesicular assemblies incorporating the functionalized glycolipid 11, a model reaction on micellar assemblies of 11a4 was performed. Propargyl alcohol was used as a water-soluble
alkyne component together with a copper(I) catalyst generated from
copper sulfate and sodium ascorbate. The unusual probe enables the
evaporative removal of the unreacted alkyne component after the coupling,
which simplifies the analysis. The use of the micelle model instead
of vesicles originated from unavailability of a suitable click-functionalized
fluorescent or photometric quantifiable probe to evaluate the coupling
process. Instead, the surfactant was extracted after the reaction,
and the coupling process was investigated by spectroscopy. The low
content of the functionalized glycolipid in vesicles prevents an effective
monitoring of the coupling process, while such constrains do not apply
for assemblies of the pure surfactant. However, since the latter are
of micellar shape, as indicated previously, a different assembly was
used as a model. The high surface density of the surfactants in the
micelle was expected to prevent a complete conversion of the azide
groups, as shown in Scheme 2. This, however, did not affect the monitoring. The IR analysis
of the isolated surfactant after the micelle click coupling exhibited
a drastic reduction of the azide peak, as depicted in Figure 3. This suggests a high yield
for the click reaction despite the dense anchor packing. Moreover,
the NMR analysis of the click product revealed an additional peak
in the aromatic region, as shown in Figure 4. A comparison of this peak with 16, resembling a synthetic analogue of 14, confirmed the
assignment of the triazole.

Conclusions
6-Halofunctionalization
of Guerbet glucosides followed by subsequent Menschutkin reaction
with azido-terminated oligo-ethoxylated imidazole provides easy access
to cationic glycolipids with click functionality. The imidazolium
cation increases the molecular solubility of the glycolipid due to
repulsive interactions of the head groups and alters the assembly
geometry of the surfactant. Its application as a cosurfactant on Guerbet
lactosides furnished small vesicles with high size homogeneity and
positive surface charge, reflecting the presence of the functionalized
glycolipid. A micellar model study confirmed high bioconjugation potential
for the functionalized glycolipids according to the CuAAC click reaction.
Therefore, the cosurfactant has high potential for applications in
targeted vesicular drug delivery.

General
Methods
Starting materials (synthesis grade) and solvents
(AR-grade) were obtained from various commercial resources and used
without prior purification. Reactions were followed by TLC, applying
staining by dilute ethanolic H2SO4 followed
by subsequent heating. Chromatographic purifications were performed
on silica gel 60 (35–70 μm) using the flash technique.
Optical rotations were measured on a JASCO P-1020 digital polarimeter
using 10 cm cells. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer ATR
FTIR with 4 cm–1 resolution. NMR measurements were
performed on 400 MHz spectrometers at room temperature (rt) using
solvent peaks for calibration. 13C spectra applied the
APT protocol. Assignments are based on the analyses of coupling patterns
and HSQC correlations. Mass spectra were recorded in the ESI mode
on an Agilent 6550 Q-TOF and a Jeol AccuTOF spectrometer.

Physical Studies
All surfactants were dried in a desiccator over P2O5 for several hours prior to physical investigations. Distilled
water with an electric conductivity of 1.1 ± 0.1 μS cm–1 at 25 °C was applied for all formulation studies.
Lyotropic phase investigations were performed on a modified Amscope
microscope with installed polarizers using the contact penetration
technique.36 The assembly of surfactants
was studied by systematic surface tension measurements on a Sigma
702 tensiometer using the Du Noüy ring method. Sample solutions
were equilibrated for several hours before the measurement, while
valid surface tension measurements required five replicates with a
maximum standard deviation of 0.1 mN m–1. The critical
aggregation concentration (CAC) was determined as the intersection
of the regression lines for the concentration-dependent and the concentration-independent
regions of the plot of the surface tension against the logarithmic
surfactant concentration. The molecular surface area was calculated
from the slope of the concentration-dependent region in the surface
tension: log(c) plots based on the Gibbs adsorption
isotherm.43 The formulation of vesicles applied
the ethanolic injection method.41 An ethanolic
surfactant solution was rapidly injected into a stirred 19th-fold
volume of water through a 25 Ga bevel tip needle. The concentration
was selected to obtain a final surfactant concentration of about 1
mM. Samples were left for several hours prior to analysis to ensure
equilibration. Particle sizes were determined at rt by dynamic light
scattering on a Malvern Zen 3600 Zetasizer, applying a measuring angle
of 173°. Zeta potential measurements applied the same instrument.

A solution of 5a (0.19 g, 0.35 mmol) and 94 (96 mg, 0.35

the absence of the starting material, the solvent was evaporated to
provide 10a4 (0.25 g, 85%) as a yellow syrup.
The intermediate 10a4 (92 mg, 0.11 mmol) was
subjected to Zemplén deacetylation in MeOH (5 mL) using a catalytic
amount of NaOMe. After stirring at rt overnight, the catalyst was
removed by treatment with Amberlite IR120 (H+), and the
solvent was evaporated to furnish 11a4 (70

Micelle Click Coupling (14)
A micellar dispersion
of 11a4 (14 mg, 20 μmol) in water (1
mL) was treated with propargyl alcohol (10 μL, 0.17 mmol), sodium
ascorbate (2 mg, 0.01 mmol), and CuSO4×5aq (1 mg, 4 μmol). The mixture was stirred at rt overnight before
it was diluted with water (5 mL) and extracted with nBuOH (3 × 5 mL). The organic phases were combined and
evaporated to provide the click-coupled surfactant for analysis.
