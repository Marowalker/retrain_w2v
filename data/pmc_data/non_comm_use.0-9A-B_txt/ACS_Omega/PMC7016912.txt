The
influence of different reaction conditions on the yield of
syringaldehyde was studied by using perovskite oxide as the catalyst.
The optimal reaction conditions are as follows: 0.60 g of dealkali
lignin, 0.60 g of 5 wt % theta ring-loaded LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 catalyst, 30 mL of 1.0 mol/L NaOH solution,
160 °C reaction temperature, 0.80 MPa O2 pressure,
and 2.5 h reaction time. Under these conditions, the highest syringaldehyde
yield was 10.00%. The recycling performance of the catalyst was studied.
It was found by XRD analysis that the catalyst maintained high catalytic
activity after four times of use.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biomass, as a widely existing
renewable resource in nature, has
been paid more and more attention to because of its properties and
efficient utilization. Lignin is one of the three major components
of biomass. It is composed of guaiacyl, syringyl, and p-hydroxyphenyl monomers linked by C–O and C–C bonds
and has a complex three-dimensional structure.1,2 Lignin
molecules contain phenolic hydroxyl, methoxy, and carboxyl groups,
which provide a basis for its industrial applications.3 In recent years, the degradation of lignin into small molecular
products with high added values has become a research hotspot. Its
own benzene ring structure also provides a possibility for the formation
of small molecular compounds with broken chains. In the previous study,
lignin was degraded into small aromatic products with high added values,
such as phenol and aromatic aldehydes, via reduction and oxidation.4−6 As one of the refined products of lignin, syringaldehyde has some
unique applications in medicine due to its characteristics.29 In some experiments, syringaldehyde was used
as a raw material to prepare dendrimers from alkynes catalyzed by
solid copper particles, which greatly improved the oxidation resistance.34 Through the study on the intravenous injection
of syringaldehyde in diabetic rats, researchers found that syringaldehyde
can increase the glucose consumption in the body of the sick rats
and play a role in reducing blood sugar, so syringaldehyde can be
used as an auxiliary agent for the treatment of diabetic patients
in the future.35 In addition, a study has
shown that syringaldehyde can indirectly cut the DNA strand through
some mechanism, which is a potential natural resource with anticancer
properties.36 Because the yield of syringaldehyde
is far lower than those of vanillin and other aldehydes and it is
not as nontoxic as vanillin, there are few studies on syringaldehyde.

Perovskite oxides exhibit high activity and stability in the catalytic
oxidation of hydrocarbons and have been widely used in biomass catalytic
conversion, oxygenated fuel combustion, electrochemistry, and other
fields in recent years.17−19,24 It has broad prospects in replacing
noble-metal catalysts.7−9 Perovskite oxide is a heterogeneous catalyst with
large specific surface area, high catalytic activity, and small environmental
pollution.10 It can be separated from the
reaction system via a simple centrifuge operation, and when reused,
it can still maintain high reactive activity. Because of its excellent
properties, most of the existing studies use perovskite catalysts
to guide the catalytic reaction.11−13 Ansaloni et al.30 used bioethanol to produce industrial waste
as the raw material (steam-exploded lignin derived from wheat straw)
and perovskite as the catalyst. The best performance exhibits a lignin
dissolution ratio of 53% with 1.3% yield toward aromatic compounds.
Banu et al.31 used perovskite as the catalyst to transform bagasse lignin. The
results showed that the phenolic product mainly consisted of phenol,
guaiacyl, catechol, and syringyl groups; their selectivities were
35.19, 6.18, 10.68, and 14.21%, respectively. Some researchers33 also prepared a series of LaFe1–xMnxO3 and
La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 hollow nanospheres
for the catalytic conversion of lignin. They have good catalytic performance
and good stability. In addition, researchers32 used La0.8M0.2FeO3 (M = La, Ca,
Sr, Ba) as catalysts to catalyze the pyrolysis of bagasse lignin to
prepare aryl oxygenated compounds. The perovskite showed nice structural
and catalytic stability after 5 cycles of redox.

Previous studies32−34 have found that perovskite oxides doped with copper
can improve lignin conversion. However, no papers have discussed the
reaction of lignin to syringaldehyde catalyzed by LaNi1–xCuxO3 and
LaFe1–xCuxO3. So, LaNi1–xCuxO3 and LaFe1–xCuxO3 doped
with Cu were selected as catalysts in this study. Four lignin samples
in this paper come from by-products of chemical plants. Choosing them
as raw materials for the production of syringaldehyde is helpful to
solve the problem of high-value utilization of by-product treatment
in factories. In this study, under the same conditions, the yields
of syringaldehyde from four different lignins were compared. Then
two lignins with high yields of syringaldehyde were selected for further
studies. Finally, according to the yield of syringaldehyde, the dealkaline
lignin was selected as the best lignin. On the basis of the study
of LaB1–xCuxO3 (B = Fe, Ni) as the catalysts, a new type
of supported perovskite catalyst with theta ring packing as the carrier
was innovatively considered to improve syringaldehyde yield. At the
same time, the mass transfer effect of theta ring packing is better,
the supported catalyst is easy to separate, and it has corrosion resistance
and structural stability, which provides a new method for the industrialization
of the lignin scale industry.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) Analysis
of Different Lignin Species
The relationship between the
average molecular weight in GPC chromatogram and the response intensity
of the detector is shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. Cross-linked lignin (CLL) is calculated by using the peak
value at 1500/1600 in Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) data. It
can be seen that the corresponding intensity of dealkali lignin is
similar to that of industrial lignin, and the polydispersity coefficient
is close in value. However, the average molecular weight of dealkali
lignin is slightly higher, and the ash content is lower. From Figure 2A, the yield of syringaldehyde
is also higher. When the molecular weight distribution of lignin samples
is basically the same, the higher the ash content is, the lower the
yield of syringaldehyde is. Sodium lignosulfonate was prepared from
wheat straw and Masson’s pine. However, the shape of molecular
weight distribution is similar, which may be due to the same extraction
method. The yield of syringaldehyde from wheat straw is slightly higher
than that from woody Pinus massoniana because of the larger average molecular weight and polydispersity
coefficient of wheat straw than those from woody P.
massoniana.

2.2 Effect of Cu Doping on
Syringaldehyde Yield
As shown in Table 2, syringaldehyde yields catalyzed by different
Cu-doped catalysts
are different. When the catalyst is not added, the syringaldehyde
yield is only 0.96%. Under the catalysis of LaFeO3, syringaldehyde
yield is increased to 1.80%. With increasing Cu doping amount on the
perovskite B position, syringaldehyde yield is increased. When the
doping amount of Cu reaches 0.8, syringaldehyde yield is the highest.
When LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 is used as a
catalyst, the yield is 4.38%. Meanwhile, when LaNi0.2Cu0.8O3 is used as a catalyst, the yield is 4.00%.
Therefore, the addition of the Cu element improves the catalytic performance
of perovskite oxide. Increasing the content of Cu in the catalyst
can increase the oxygen content of perovskite oxides, enhance the
activity of the catalyst, and increase the yield of syringaldehyde.
When the content of Cu is higher, the specific surface area of the
catalyst is larger, which makes the catalyst have more active sites,
thus improving the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides.

2.3 Effect of the Amount of
Catalyst on Syringaldehyde
Yield
As shown in Figure 2A, when the amount of catalyst is increased, the yields
of syringaldehyde in all lignin samples are increased. Compared with
industrial lignin, wheat straw, and Masson’s pine, dealkaline
lignin can obtain higher yield of syringaldehyde under the same reaction
conditions. Taking dealkaline lignin as an example, the yield of syringaldehyde
is only 2.51% when the catalyst/lignin (g/g) is 1:50; when the ratio
is increased to 1:20, the yield of syringaldehyde increases to 4.38%;
when the ratio is further increased to 1:10, the yield of syringaldehyde
decreases to 4.19%. The yields of syringaldehyde from the other three
lignins also show the same trend. Compared with dealkaline lignin
and industrial lignin, the syringaldehyde yields of sodium lignosulfonate
and Masson’s pine are lower than that of the sodium lignosulfonate
under the same reaction conditions. The reason may be due to the fact
that WSL and MPL contain the sulfur element. During the reaction,
the sulfur element may be adsorbed on the surface of metal catalysts
in a reversible or irreversible state. The active sites of the catalysts
are affected by electronic or shielding effects, and thus, the catalytic
effect of the catalysts is affected.20,21

Dealkaline
lignin with high syringaldehyde yield is selected as the raw material.
As shown in Figure 2B, when the catalyst is not added, the conversion of lignin is only
20.10%, and the yield of syringaldehyde is very little, only 0.96%.
After adding the catalyst, the lignin conversion rate and the syringaldehyde
yield are significantly increased. The lignin conversion rate is 35.26%
and syringaldehyde yield is 2.51% when the mass ratio is 1:50. Compared
with the reaction without the catalyst, lignin conversion and syringaldehyde
yield are increased by 43.85 and 61.75%, respectively. After further
increasing the amount of catalyst, the conversion rate of lignin increases
further. When the ratio of catalyst/lignin is 1:20, the lignin conversion
rate is the highest, reaching 84.97%. With the increase of catalyst
dosage (when the ratio is greater than 1:20), the conversion of lignin
is increased, while the yield of syringaldehyde is decreased. The
reason may be due to the fact that, with the increase in the amount
of catalyst, the contact chance between catalyst and lignin is increased,
more lignin is broken, and the conversion of lignin is increased.
While the catalyst promotes the formation of syringaldehyde, it also
further catalyzes the oxidation of aldehydes to form carboxylic acid
or other by-products, resulting in a decrease in the yield of syringaldehyde.22,23 Therefore, choosing the appropriate amount of catalyst plays a key
role in the catalytic conversion process. When the ratio is 1:20,
the lignin conversion rate is higher, and the syringaldehyde is not
further catalyzed to be oxidized to carboxylic acid. Therefore, a
follow-up study on the catalyst/lignin ratio (g/g) under the condition
of 1:20 is performed.

2.4 Effect of Different Reaction
Conditions on
Syringaldehyde Yield
As shown in Figure 3A (LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 as catalyst, liquid/lignin at 50:1 (v/w), 30 mL NaOH, 0.8
MPa O2, 160 °C, 2.5 h), when dealkaline lignin is
used as the raw material, the alkali concentration increases from
0.5 to 1 mol/L, and the yield of syringaldehyde increases from 3.46
to 6.31%. When industrial lignin is used as the raw material, the
syringaldehyde yield increases from 2.56 to 3.71%. This is because
alkali solution can ionize phenolic hydroxyl groups in the lignin
structure, form activated lignin, increase the negatively charged
central sites with higher electron density, and make it vulnerable
to electrophilic reagents. With the increase of alkali concentration,
the degree of ionization of phenolic hydroxyl groups in lignin increases,
which can better contact with oxidants and ultimately improve the
yield of syringaldehyde. When the alkali concentration is more than
1 mol/L, the yield of syringaldehyde decreases with the increase of
alkali concentration. Therefore, the 1 mol/L alkali concentration
is selected for further studies.

Figure 3 Effect of different reaction conditions
on syringaldehyde yield.
(A) Effects of alkali concentration on SY yield; (B) effects of reaction
time on SY yield; (C) effects of O2 pressure on SY yield;
(D) effects of temperature on SY yield.

The effect of reaction time on the syringaldehyde yield is shown
in Figure 3B (dealkaline
lignin as the raw material, liquid/lignin at 50:1 (v/w), 30 mL of
1 moL/L NaOH, 0.8 MPa O2, 160 °C). The yields of syringaldehyde
from lignin catalyzed by LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 and LaNi0.2Cu0.8O3 are 1.03 and
0.96%, respectively, at a reaction time of 0.5 h. With the increase
of reaction time, the yield of syringaldehyde shows an upward trend.
The highest yields are 5.28 and 4.60% at 2.5 h. When the reaction
time is 3 h, the yield of syringaldehyde decreases. This may be due
to the further oxidation of syringaldehyde to acid under the catalysis
of oxygen oxidation and perovskite oxides. Therefore, when the reaction
time is controlled at 2.5 h, a higher yield can be obtained and further
oxidation of the product can be prevented.

The phenolic structure
of lignin and conjugated structure of benzene
ring have higher reactivity with O2. O2 plays
an oxidant role in the catalytic transformation of lignin. In the
normal state, O2 is a substance with weak oxidation. Therefore,
it is necessary to use alkali as the catalyst in the oxidative degradation
of lignin. Alkali ionizes phenolic hydroxyl groups on lignin structural
units and then forms aldehydes under the oxidation of oxygen and catalysis
of catalysts. The effect of oxygen on the syringaldehyde yield is
shown in Figure 3C.
The figure shows that the reaction does not occur when O2 is not filled, and the formation of aldehydes is not detected. The
O2 pressure is gradually raised from 0.2 to 0.80 MPa, and
the syringaldehyde yield is increased from 1.78 to 5.28% with dealkaline
lignin as the raw material. However, the high O2 concentration
can cause the syringaldehyde yield to decrease because high O2 pressure and O2 solubility will promote the ring
opening reaction and form a small molecular substance,25 such as succinic acid, acrylic acid, and other
carboxylic acids. Thus, 0.80 MPa is the most appropriate O2 pressure.

The syringaldehyde yields are only 0.69 and 0.56%
at 100 °C,
and the syringaldehyde yields increase to 2.12 and 2.00%, respectively,
when the temperature is increased to 120 °C. When the temperature
is further increased to 140 °C, the syringaldehyde yields are
3.50 and 3.21%. At 160 °C, the syringaldehyde yields are 5.28
and 3.71%. When the reaction is carried out at 180 °C, the syringaldehyde
yields are decreased to 2.94 and 2.46%. Therefore, increasing the
reaction temperature can promote the reaction process and increase
syringaldehyde yield. However, very high temperature will lead to
secondary polymerization. This phenomenon is similar to the effect
of temperature on syringaldehyde yield in the ionic liquid system.26−28 The lignin conversion system reaches the best temperature of 160
°C. The yields of other products in the reaction are shown in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that the change trends
of vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde under different
reaction conditions are similar to that of syringaldehyde. As a follow-up
product of syringaldehyde, the yield of syringic acid increased with
the increase of O2 pressure.

2.5 Recycling Efficiency of the Catalyst
Figure 4A shows an
XRD diagram of LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 before
and after repeated use four times. It can be seen that the structure
of perovskite has no obvious change. Perovskite still has high structural
stability. The experimental results of the catalyst reused four times
are shown in Figure 4B. It can be seen that LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 still has good catalytic performance after four times of use. The
conversion of lignin and the yield of syringaldehyde were 4.73 and
62.11%, respectively, after three reuses, which were similar to the
results of the first reuse, indicating that perovskite oxides had
high catalytic activity and structural stability in the reaction system.

2.6 Effect of Supported Catalyst
Dosage on the
Yield of Syringaldehyde
On the basis of the quality of LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 in the catalyst, the catalyst/lignin
ratios (g/g) are 1:50, 1:20, and 1:10. The results show that, when
the content of active components is the same, the syringaldehyde yield
from the catalyst loaded on the theta ring is significantly higher
than that of the unsupported catalyst (Figure 5). When the catalyst/lignin (g/g) is 1:50, the yield of syringaldehyde
obtained by the unsupported catalyst is 3.18%. The yield of syringaldehyde
after 5 wt % theta ring-supported LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 catalyzed the dealkalization of lignin was 5.28%. The
yield of syringaldehyde catalyzed by 10 wt % theta ring-supported
LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 was 5.62%. With the
increase in LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 dosage,
syringaldehyde yield also increases. When the ratio of catalyst to
lignin (g/g) is 1:20, the yield of syringaldehyde catalyzed by a 5
wt % theta ring is 10.00%, and that of syringaldehyde supported by
a 10 wt % theta ring is 7.91%. When the amount of LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 is further increased, syringaldehyde
yield is decreased. Therefore, the catalyst/lignin ratio (g/g) of
1:20 is beneficial to syringaldehyde formation. When the amount of
active ingredient is the same, the presence of the carrier increases
the specific surface area of the catalyst. Moreover, the 5 wt % loaded
theta ring has larger load space than the 10 wt % theta ring. Thus,
the catalytic effect of the 5 wt % theta ring is better than that
of the 10 wt % theta ring.

3 Conclusions
In this
paper, the process of catalytic conversion of lignin to
syringaldehyde is studied by using perovskite oxide as the catalyst.
The results show that the optimum reaction conditions are as follows:
lignin 0.60 g, 5 wt % theta ring-supported LaFe0.2Cu0.8O3 catalyst 0.60 g, 1 mol/L NaOH 30 mL, temperature
160 °C, reaction time 2.5 h, and highest syringaldehyde yield
10.00%. The catalyst still has high catalytic activity after four
cycles. Using the supported catalyst, syringaldehyde has higher yield
and good recycling efficiency, which provides a new method for the
industrialization of the lignin scale industry.

μm, the molecular weight was determined by GPC. The GPC analysis
was carried out with an Agilent1260 series equipped with RID and diode
array detector (DAD). The chromatographic column was a TSKgel G-3000PWxl
(300 × 7.8 mm). The mobile phase was 0.1 M NaAc with a flow rate
of 0.6 mL/min. The temperature of the column temperature box was 35
°C, as described in the previous study.16 The differential distribution of molecular weight W(log M) = dwt/d(log M) and W(log M) × d(log M) can be used to determine the polymer mass content in a certain
molecular weight range and correspond to the intercept of the ordinate
corresponding to a certain range of abscissa on the cumulative molecular
weight distribution map. To a certain extent, the ordinate represents
the normalized mass ratio. Therefore, the y axis
is dimensionless.

4.3.4 FT-IR Analysis
The lignin sample
(0.002 g) was mixed with KBr in the agate mortar in the proportion
of (lignin/KBr = 1:100 w/w). The functional groups of lignin were
measured by an FT-IR-600 plus spectrometer (JASCO Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
The average scanning time was 32, the scanning wavelength range was
400 to 4000 cm–1, and the resolution was 1 cm–1. Cross-linked lignin (CLL) was calculated by using
the peak value at 1500/1600 in FT-IR data.
