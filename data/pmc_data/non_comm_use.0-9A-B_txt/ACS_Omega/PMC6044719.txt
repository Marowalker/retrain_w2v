We assume formation of acyl-PdII–N-heterocyclic-carbene (NHC) organometalics
for diverse C–O/O–C
and C–C/C–O coupling catalysis of direct functionalization
and cyclization reactions. We report the first use of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) as an oxidant under an inert atmosphere to O2-sensitive
NHC for oxidative transformations. In situ generated imidazolium halides
are utilized as a precursor of NHC and as a source of alkyl group
for the sp2C–H functionalization of aldehydes to
esters under mild conditions. In contrast to the reported NHC-catalyzed
esterification strategies, the outstanding substrate scope of this
mild catalysis approach is established through synthesis of thermally
labile sugar-based chiral esters. Our competition experiments using
various unsymmetrical imidazolium halides revealed an ascending rate
of migratory aptitude among methyl ≪ allyl < crotyl <
cinnamyl < benzyl moiety. DMSO is used as an oxidant for both esterification
and cyclization reactions, and the transfer of the DMSO-oxygen to
ester is confirmed using an 18O-labeling experiment. The
diverse activity using DMSO-oxygen to acyl-PdII–NHC
is verified by developing a unique C–C-coupled cyclization
with side-chain hydroxylation of olefin to achieve valuable β-hydroxy
chromanones.

Introduction
The transition metal-catalyzed
reaction has become a powerful tool
in organic synthesis, which has played an important role in developing
chemical science and technology, with the discovery and development
of new types of chemical compounds and powerful new synthetic methodologies.1−4 Transition-metal catalysts are based on metals, such as palladium,5 nickel,6 copper,7 cobalt,8 iron,9,10 gold,11 manganese,12,13 rhodium,3,14 ruthenium,15 and
platinum,16 and they have attracted increasing
attention recently because of their diverse applications. Of the transition
metals, palladium has emerged as possibly the most widely utilized
over the past few decades.17−21 Because of its usefulness in organic synthesis, its typical (0/II)
catalytic cycle has been extensively studied. Electrophilic palladium
(II) species are known to react with a wide variety of electron-rich
substrates, often with high degrees of regio-, stereo-, and chemoselectivity.19−21 Chemists in academia and industries have continued to discover novel
ways to exploit palladium’s unique reactivity and selectivity.
To execute a new reactivity of palladium, this research is an attempt
to develop a novel method to synthesize valuable esters (4, eq i, Scheme 1)
and β-hydroxy chromanones (8, eq ii) from aldehydes
with a palladium catalyst in the presence of in situ generated imidazolium
halide in DMSO. In general, N-heterocyclic-carbene
(NHC)–Pd is generated under an inert atmosphere.22,23 Thus, the choice of oxidant is very critical for the widely utilized
oxidative NHC catalysis. However, MnO2, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidyl-1-oxy,
and hv–O2 were utilized as oxidants for NHC-catalyzed
reactions.24−26 We were looking for a mild oxidant, such as DMSO,27 for diverse oxidative coupling catalysis to
avoid deactivation of oxygen-sensitive NHC-organometallic and other
associated problems during its regeneration in the catalytic cycle,
which in turn may display a new catalytic property, such as oxidative
cyclization of aldehydes with olefins toward direct construction of
a ubiquitous natural product framework.

Scheme 1 NHC-Organometallic
Oxidative Transformation of Aldehydes with Sources
of Alkylhalides and Olefins
The ester moiety represents one of the most omnipresent
functional
groups in chemistry and plays a vital role in biology, the pharmaceutical
industry and material science, serving as key intermediates, ligands,
and protecting groups in chemistry.28−33 The classical method for ester synthesis involves the reaction of
a stoichiometric amount of carboxylic acids with appropriate alcohols
in the presence of strong acids, Lewis acids, coupling reagents (e.g.,
DCC, HOBt), or organometallic species.34−38 To avoid the limitations of the classical method,
innovative ester synthesis is accomplished through transesterification,39 oxidation of aldehydes,40 NHC-catalyzed oxidation of aldehydes,41,42 or transesterification
with alcohol,43 transition metal-catalyzed
(Rh, Ru, Ir, and Pd) oxidation of aldehydes,44 oxidation of alcohols,45 and dimerization
of aldehyde46 with a lanthanide complex
or an actinide complex, and sp3C–H bond activation.47

The chromanone core is present in a large
number of natural products
and pharmaceuticals, which shows a wide range of biological activities,
including anticancer, antitumor, antibacterial, antioxidant, or antimicrobial
properties.48−50 A limited number of studies were reported for the
synthesis of β-hydroxy chromanones. For instance, the aldol
reaction is one of the prime methods for the synthesis of β-hydroxy
chromanones.51 Modified aldol reactions
of chromanone with benzaldehyde in the presence of a copper catalyst52 via enolate formation in an intermolecular conjugate
addition of allylzinc or conjugate addition of Grignard reagent,53 and reductive coupling54 with chiral Rh(Phebox), are the recent important methods to synthesize
β-hydroxy chromanones. Despite significant advancements in the
esterification of aldehydes, a mild method is needed in the chemical
sciences for easy syntheses of functionalized esters and β-hydroxy
chromanones, which offers operational simplicity, outstanding selectivity,
cost-effectiveness, and that will improve the substrate scope.

Results
and Discussion
To synthesize esters, this work began with
the synthesis of dibenzylimidazolium
bromide55 (3a, Table 1) by simple mixing of benzyl
bromide (2a) and N-benzyl imidazole
(X, Scheme 1) in situ before the reaction. It is anticipated that the palladium
catalyst and the NHC,56−59 which are generated in situ from imidazolium halides, are compatible
with each other. Additionally, it is assumed that acyl-PdII–imidazolium might be generated from the aldehyde, imidazolium
NHC, and a palladium catalyst. We envisaged that the ester could be
produced using the oxidant DMSO27 through
a chelation-assisted process. Imidazolium bromide will play a dual
role aiding in the formation of acyl-PdII–NHC and
serving as the source of the alkyl group. To explore this idea, benzaldehyde
(1a) was allowed to react with both dibenzylimidazolium
bromide (3a) and DMSO in the presence of palladium, and
with other metal catalysts, and in a N2 atmosphere at ambient
temperature (Table 1). The sp2C–H functionalized esterification reaction
was unsuccessful using Pd(0) as the catalyst [Pd(PPh3)4 ] (entry 1, Table 1). Other palladium catalysts, such as PdCl2 and
Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, were effective for
the catalysis with poor yields (entries 2 and 3, Table 1). Commercially available rare-earth
and transition-metal catalysts were used, but they were ineffective
(entries 4–12). It was observed that PtBr2 (10 mol
%) produced the desired product benzyl benzoate (4a,
entry 13, Table 1).
However, the low yield of the product 4a (32%) and high
cost of the catalyst led to the search for an efficient and inexpensive
catalyst. Pd(OAc)2 caused a significant improvement in
the yield (84%, entry 14), and the catalyst loading was optimized
to 7 mol %. Instead of making 3a in situ, we also studied
the reaction using pure 3a under the same conditions
and the yield (86%) of 4a was not significantly improved.
Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of Pd(OAc)2 drastically
decreased, when the base was changed from 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene
(DBU) to NEt3 (entry 15, Table 1). The byproduct N-benzyl
imidazole was recovered from the postreaction mixture and recycled.

Encouraged by the promising optimization
results, the scope of
the reaction was explored (Scheme 2) with functionalized aromatic aldehydes (1) bearing electron-withdrawing (EWD, 1b–e,1h), electron-donating (EDG, 1f,1g), and meta-substituted (1b,1h) groups and the corresponding desired esters were obtained 4b–e,h (entries 2–5
and 8), 4f,g (entries 6 and 7), and 4b,4h (entries 2 and 8), respectively. In general,
the esterification reactions occurred at relatively faster rates (24–26
h) and provided good-to-excellent yields (67–86%) for the desired
products bearing EWGs in the aromatic residue (4b–e,4h, entries 2–5 and 8) in comparison
with those possessing EDGs (4f,4g, entries
6 and 7, time: 26 and 30 h; yield: 62 and 72%). Interestingly, the
meta-substituted aromatic aldehydes resulted in a better reaction
rate and yield for both products 4b bearing EWG (entry
2; time: 24 h; yield: 86%) and 4g possessing EDG (entry
7, time: 26 h; yield: 72%) with respect to the related analogues.
These results support the formation of the acyl-PdII–NHC
intermediate during the progress of the catalytic transformation.
The reaction conditions were also validated for conjugated aldehydes,
such as cinnamaldehyde and its 4-nitroderivative (1i,1j), and the corresponding benzyl cinnamates (4i,4j, entries 9 and 10) were furnished with 85 and 88%
yield, respectively. The development of the mild approach has prompted
us to improve the substrate scope, such as the use of labile sugar-based
aliphatic aldehydes to highly chiral center-decorated esters. Gratifyingly,
the esterification reactions were successful for the pentose (1k–m) and triose (1n) sugar-based
aliphatic aldehydes to afford directly the valuable functionalized
esters bearing multiple chiral centers (4k–n, entries 11–14).

Scheme 2 Scope of the Alkylation with DMSO
to Diverse Esters (4)
After successful esterification of aromatic and thermally
labile
aliphatic aldehydes (Scheme 2) using in situ generated dibenzylimidazolium bromide (3a) as an aldehyde activator and benzyl source, we have aimed
to synthesize other allyl-based esters (5, Scheme 3). Therefore, we prepared crotylmethylimidazolium
bromide (3b), allylmethylimidazolium bromide (3c), and cinnamylmethylimidazolium chloride (3d) by mixing N-methyl imidazole (X) and corresponding alkylhalides
in DMSO for 3–5 h at ambient temperature. Surprisingly, the
very fast reaction between benzaldehyde (1a) and in situ
generated 3b produced selectively corresponding crotylbenzoate
(5a) in 82% yield. The other possible product methylbenzoate
(6) was not detected in the postreaction mixture. It
clearly indicates the excellent ability of the PdII–NHC
catalytic system to transfer N-allyl groups of allylmethylimidazolium
halide analogue with respect to competitive methyl ester. The substrate
scope of the mild reaction was examined using different functionalized
aldehydes (1a–d,1i–j), in situ prepared imidazolium halides (3b–d) and oxidant DMSO to afford corresponding crotyl benzoates
(5a,5b,5e,5f),
allyl benzoates (5c,5d,5g,5h), and cinnamyl benzoate (5i,5j) with excellent yields (73–89%).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Allyl
Ester Analogues (5)
The outstanding reactivity of dibenzylimidazolium bromide
(3a) and methylallylimidazolium halide analogues (3a–d) (Schemes 2 and 3) led us to
investigate
competition reactions using imidazolium halides bearing both N-benzyl and N-alkyl residues (Scheme 4). Unsymmetrical
imidazolium halides (3e–g) were utilized
for the esterification reaction. First, benzylcrotyl imidazolium bromide
(3e) was used with aromatic and conjugated aldehydes
to produce the crotyl aromatic esters (entries 1–4) in moderate
yields (5a,5b,5e,5f; yield 34, 38, 32, 37%), and it selectively provided greater yields
in favor of benzyl aromatic esters (4a,4b,4i,4j; yield 46, 52, 44, 55%). The results
revealed that the rate of O–C bond formation with a benzyl
group is much higher than that of a crotyl group. Similar results
were obtained with allylbenzylimidazolium bromide (3f), which produced benzyl esters (4a,4b,4i,4j; yields 46, 58, 46, 58%) and allyl esters
(5c,5d,5g,5h;
yields 3, 33, 31, 33%; entries 5–8). Using cinnamylbenzylimidazolium
chloride 3g also resulted in cinnamyl esters (5i,5j) in poor yields (34% each) with respect to the corresponding
benzyl ester (4a,4i; yields 48 and 56%;
entries 9 and 10). Thus, the esterification with unsymmetrical imidazolium
bromide clearly shows that the probability for O–C bond formation
was greatly enhanced in the following sequence: benzyl > cinnamyl
> crotyl > allyl ≫ Me. Herein, a general catalytic synthetic
approach is established through exploiting substituted methylimidazolium
halide NHC-analogues (3b–d) toward
the synthesis of esters with moderate-to-outstanding selectivities
(Schemes 3 and 4).

Scheme 4 Competition Esterification Catalysis with
Unsymmetrical Imidazolium
Halides
The plausible reaction
mechanism is expected to involve the formation
of a PdII-coordinated benzyl imidazolium alcohol (I, Scheme 5).56 The PdII-complex (I) is immediately converted into acyl-PdII–imidazolium
(II) with the release of an acetate anion. The nucleophilic
attack of DMSO oxygen occurred following chelation of PdII with II, which was converted to the putative intermediate III. In the intermediate step (III), the oxyanion
that reforms the carbonyl and the C–Pd makes a new bond to
the DMSO oxygen with the removal of Me2S to construct IV. The nucleophilic attack of the acetate anion to PdII assists O–C bond formation to achieve the desired
ester (4a) with release of benzyl imidazole (X). The catalyst Pd(OAc)2 is simultaneously regenerated
for the next cycle.

Scheme 5 C–O/O–C-Coupled Catalytic Cycle
To support the proposed mechanism,
a labeling experiment was performed
(Scheme 6) using 18O-labeled-DMSO, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (1c), and
dibenzylimidazolium bromide (3a). The high-resolution
electron spray ionization (HRESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) spectrum
(Figure 1A and Supporting Information) analysis of the ongoing
reaction mixture clearly verified the presence of the desired ester 18O-4c at e/m 249.0564 and 251.0536 (two major peaks). The electron ionization
(EI)-MS analysis (Figure 1B) of this reaction mixture confirms the presence of 16O-4-chlorobenzoyl radical cation fragments at e/m 139 and 141 and the 18O-benzyl radical
cation fragment at e/m 109. This
labeling experiment supports the assertion that DMSO served as an
oxidant in the transformation of aldehydes to esters, and the delivered
oxygen atom is incorporated majorly into the alcohol portion of the
ester.

(HR-MS) spectrum of the ongoing
labeling experiment. (B) EI-MS spectrum of the ongoing labeling experiment.

To expand the applicability of
the newly developed strategy and
in support of the compatibility of palladium catalyst with NHC, we
performed C–C/C–O-coupled transformation of several O-cinnamyl and O-crotyl aldehydes (7b–h) bearing aryl groups to access two
possible diastereomeric β-hydroxy-4-chromanones (8x,8y, Scheme 7) using the optimized conditions (entry 14, Table 1) with a catalytic amount of 3a (15 mol %). The desired products (8a–h) were obtained with good yields (62–74%). The C–C
and C–O coupling to the double bond occurred in a stereoelectronically
antifashion to afford the (±)-β-hydroxy chromanone with
>99% diastereoselectivity. Thus, PdII–NHC–DMSO
is also a chemo-, regio- and stereoselective reagent. Herein, another
striking difference is that, unlike common Stetter60−64 C–C coupling 
reaction of aldehydes with olefins bearing electron-withdrawing substituents,
the reaction smoothly underwent C–C coupling with disubstituted
activated olefins bearing oxymethyl, methyl, and phenyl moieties,
and additionally it installed one hydroxyl group in a stereoselective
fashion.

Scheme 7 C–C/C–O-Coupled Catalysis to β-Hydroxy
Chromanones
(8)
The mechanism of the cyclization process is expected to
be similar
to the esterification reaction, which involves formation of a PdII-coordinated O-cinnamyl benzyl imidazolium
alcohol (V, Scheme 8).56 The PdII-complex (V) was converted into acyl-PdII–imidazolium putative intermediate VI with the
release of an acetate anion. The nucleophilic attack occurs to the
olefin (VI) from the same face following chelation with
DMSO, which leads to the construction of cyclized intermediate (±)-VIIsyn-stereochemistry. In the intermediate
step, the oxyanion (VII) reformed into the carbonyl group
with C–Pd bond formation and a new bond to the DMSO-oxygen
with release of Me2S to generate intermediate VIII. The nucleophilic attack of the acetate anion to PdII provided the desired (±)-β-hydroxy chromanone (8a) with regeneration of the Pd(OAc)2 catalyst
for the next cycle.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All reagents were purchased from
commercial suppliers and used without further purification, unless
otherwise specified. Commercially supplied ethyl acetate and petroleum
ether were distilled before use. DMSO was dried through distillation
using calcium hydride before use. The petroleum ether used in our
experiments had a boiling range of 60–80 °C. Column chromatography
was performed on silica gel (60–120 mesh, 0.12–0.25
mm). Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on 0.25
mm extra-hard silica gel plates with a UV254 fluorescent indicator.
The reported melting points are uncorrected. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using
300 MHz spectrometers (300 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C). Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million with
respect to a tetramethylsilane internal reference, and coupling constants
are reported in hertz. Proton multiplicities are represented as s
(singlet), d (doublet), dd (double doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet),
and m (multiplet). Infrared spectra were recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer
in thin films. HR-MS data were acquired using an electron spray ionization
technique on a Q-tof-micro quadruple mass spectrophotometer. Optical
rotation of the chiral compounds was measured in a polarimeter using
a standard 10 cm quartz cell in a sodium-D lamp at ambient temperature.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Esters
Under
an atmosphere of N2, the alkyl halide (1.5 mmol) was added
dropwise to a solution of 1-benzyl imidazole (1.5 mmol) in dry DMSO
(5 mL) in the presence of activated MS (4 Å) at room temperature.
The reaction mixture was stirred for 2–5 h to complete the
generation of disubstituted imidazolium halide (3), which
was monitored using TLC. Aldehyde (1, 1.0 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (7 mol %), and DBU (2.0 mmol) were added in the same reaction
mixture and stirred until the reaction was completed. Progress of
the reaction was monitored using TLC. The postreaction mixture was
filtered through a cellite bed taken in a sintered funnel and washed
with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The filtrate was extracted with EtOAc
(2 × 15 mL), and the combined organic layer was washed with water
(3 × 10 mL) as well as brine (1 × 10 mL). The organic portion
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and
evaporated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at room temperature.
The crude product was purified via column chromatography on silica
gel (60–120 mesh) using ethyl acetate–petroleum ether
as an eluent, which afforded the corresponding pure esters. The byproduct N-alkyl imidazole was recovered from the crude reaction
mixture and recycled. Thus, the reaction of benzyl bromide (2a, 1.5 mmol, 0.2 mL), 1-benzyl imidazole (3a, 1.5 mmol, 237 mg), and benzaldehyde (1a, 1.0 mmol,
106 mg) afforded benzyl benzoate (4a) in 84% yield (179
mg) after purification via column chromatography on silica gel (60–120
mesh) using ethyl acetate–petroleum ether (1:99, v/v) as the
eluent. The synthesized esters (4a–n, 5a–j) were characterized by recording the NMR (1H and 13C), FT-IR, melting point (solid compounds), and mass spectra
(HR-ESIMS) analyses.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of O-Cinnamylated/Crotylated
Aldehydes (7a–h)69
To a stirred solution of a salicaldehyde derivative (10 mmol) suspended
in anhydrous potassium carbonate (15 mmol; 2.07 g) in dimethylformamide
(DMF) (25 mL), a solution of cinnamyl bromide (13 mmol; 2.55 g) in
DMF (5 mL) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred further at
room temperature until the reaction was complete (10–12 h),
which was monitored using TLC. The oily products 7a,7b,7d,7f–h and solid 7c,7e were obtained after pouring the postreaction
mixture into 100 g of crushed-ice with constant stirring. The oily
products were extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 25 mL). The combined
ether extracts were dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated
to dryness to achieve the oily products 7a,7b,7d,7f–h. On the other hand, the
solid products were filtered, washed with cold water (3 × 10
mL), and dried in open air at room temperature. The products were
obtained in 90–95% yields.

General Procedure for the

(8a–h)
Under an atmosphere of N2, benzyl bromide (0.2 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1-benzyl
imidazole (0.2 mmol, 32 mg) in dry DMSO (5 mL) in the presence activated
MS (4 Å) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred
for 2 h, and completion of the formation of dibenzylimidazolium bromide
(3a) was monitored using TLC. O-Crotylated/cinnamylatedaldehyde
(7, 1.0 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (7 mol %), and DBU
(2.0 mmol) were added in the same reaction mixture and stirred until
the reaction was complete. Progress of the cyclization reaction was
monitored using TLC. The postreaction mixture was filtered through
a cellite bed taken in a sintered funnel, the filtrate was extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 15 mL), and the combined organic layer was washed
with water (3 × 10 mL) as well as brine (1 × 10 mL). It
was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and
evaporated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at room temperature.
The crude product was purified using column chromatography on silica
gel (60–120 mesh) with ethyl acetate–petroleum ether
(10–30%, v/v) as an eluent, which afforded the corresponding
(±)-β-hydroxy chromanones. Thus, the reaction of benzyl
bromide (2a, 0.2 mmol, 0.1 ml), 1-benzyl imidazole (3a, 0.2 mmol, 32 mg), and o-cinnamylbenzaldehyde
(7a, 1.0 mmol, 238 mg) afforded (±)-3-hydroxy(phenyl)methyl)chroman-4-one
(8a) in a 72% yield (183 mg) after purification via column
chromatography on silica gel (60–120 mesh) using ethyl acetate–petroleum
ether (10:90, v/v) as the eluent. Synthesized β-hydroxy chromanones
(8a–h) were characterized by recording NMR (1H and 13C), FT-IR, melting point (solid compounds),
and mass spectra (HR-ESIMS) analyses.

Method for the Preparation
of 18O-Labeled DMSO71
The solid dimethylsulfur dibromide
(5.0 g, 22.5 mmol) was prepared according to a known procedure.71 It was added stepwise over 15 min to a vigorously
stirred solution of triethylamine (6.3 mL, 45 mmol) and 18O-labeled water (97 atom % 18O, 0.20 mL, 11 mmol) in 15
mL of dry THF. The temperature of the reaction was maintained below
50 °C by occasional cooling in an ice–water bath. The
precipitate of triethylamine hydrobromide was removed via centrifugation
and washed twice with ether. The combined yellow supernatant and washings
were dried under high vacuum at ambient temperature to remove the
solvent and resulted in 0.4 g of a pale yellow liquid. Without further
purification, the reaction was performed among 4-chlorobenzaldehyde 1c (0.2 mmol, 28 mg), benzyl bromide (2a, 0.3
mmol, 0.1 mL), and 1-benzyl imidazole (3a, 0.3 mmol,
50 mg) using the above general experimental procedure. The 18O-labeled product was analyzed using HRESI-MS and ESIMS experiments.

Conclusions
In this research, we have successfully conducted
a palladium-catalyzed
conversion of aldehydes to esters with imidazolium bromide and DMSO
as an oxidant. A wide range of imidazolium halides were prepared in
situ and utilized as activators of aldehydes and alkyl sources, and
efficiently performed the palladium-catalyzed conversion of benzaldehydes,
cinnamaldehydes, and sugar aldehydes to the corresponding esters under
an inert atmosphere in the presence of a base without using traditional
oxidants. A labeling experiment provided useful information about
the incorporation of DMSO oxygen. The combination of PdII–NHC–DMSO is an efficient tool for stereoselective
vicinal heterofunctionalization of olefins, which produced (±)-syn-β-hydroxy chromanone. This palladium-catalyzed
reaction with DMSO and imidazolium halides provide new prospects and
perspectives in the area of organic transformations for easy access
of a wide range of valuable compounds.
