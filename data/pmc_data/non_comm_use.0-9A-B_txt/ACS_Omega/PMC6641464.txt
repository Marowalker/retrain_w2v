This
paper reports the carbon quantum dots-doped magnetic electrospinning
nanofibers for the self-display and removal of Hg(II) ions from water.
The fluorescent carbon quantum dots and magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were pre-prepared successfully, and they appeared
to be homogeneously dispersed in nanofibers via electrospinning. During
the sorption of Hg(II) ions, the significant fluorescence signals
of nanofibers gradually declined and exhibited a good linear relationship
with cumulative adsorption capacity, which could be easily recorded
by the photoluminescence spectra. The sorption performance of mercury
ions onto the nanofibers was investigated in terms of different experimental
factors including contact time, solution pH value, and initial ion
concentration. Considering the actual parameters, the nanofibers were
sensitive self-display adsorption system for Hg(II) ions in the existence
of other cation. The sorption data were described by different kinetic
models, which indicate that the whole sorption was controlled by chemical
adsorption. The intraparticle diffusion mass transfer was not obvious
in this system, which further proved the uniform adsorption and even
fluorescence quenching in nanofibers. Additionally, the nanocomposite
fiber could regenerate in several cycles with no significant loss
of adsorption capacity and fluorescence intensity. Thus, the nanofibers
are promising alternatives for environmental pollution incidents.
It is especially competent due to its high efficiency for self-display
and removal of high concentration of mercury ions.

1 Introduction
As
one of the most challenging issues, heavy metal ion pollutants
have evoked huge attention throughout the globe for many decades.1 In particular, the extremely toxic, mutagenic,
and carcinogenic mercury (Hg) ions in the environment can cause a
wide range of severe damage to the endocrine system, brain, kidneys,
and even nervous system.2 They are often
transformed into organic Hg(II) by bacteria and enter human body via
the food chains with a high risk of bioaccumulation.3 Thus, the removal of mercury ions from the natural environment
is significant owing to a matter of water safety, chemical analysis,
and human health.4 Considerable new methodologies
are accordingly being developed for effective recognition and removal
of mercury ions. For example, several analytical tools to quantify
trace Hg(II) ions have been reported, including atomic absorption
spectrometry,5 stripping voltammetric detection,6 neutron activation analysis,7 fluorescence detection,8 inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy,9 ICP-mass spectrometry,10 and
cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry.11 On the other hand, a wide range of absorbents, such as nanoparticles
(NPs), metal–organic frameworks,12 natural polymers,13 porous silica,14 and hydrogels,15 are
being considered for the possible adsorption to remove Hg(II) ions.
To achieve adsorption and detection, to date, substantial bifunctional
materials based on electrochemical, fluorescence, and optical probe
have been designed, such as pillararene-based aggregation-induced-emission-active
supramolecular,16 oligonucleotide-functionalized
core/shell magnetic silica sphere@Au,17 magnetic self-assembled zeolite clusters,18 DNA-functionalized materials,4,15 magnetic cellulose–chitosan
(CS) hydrogels,13 particulate ligand-impregnated
nanomaterials,19−21 Fe3O4@SiO2–Au@PSiO2,22 thioether-based fluorescent
covalent organic framework,23 cyclodextrin-modified
magnetic NPs,24 rhodamine derivative functionalized
CS,25 and luminescent gold NPs based materials.26,27 These assays provide a reliable and efficient indirect method for
recognizing and removing Hg(II) ions. Nevertheless, most of the materials
have a definite super-lower detection limit and an unmatched higher
adsorption capacity. In other words, these composites are difficult
to achieve continuous recognizable absorption, especially in the high
mercury ion concentration.

One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures
have been arousing considerable
interest due to their excellent performance and broad applications
in many fields, such as drug carriers in controlled release, optoelectronics,
food manufacturing, filtration, sensor technology, catalysis, and
scaffolds in tissue engineering.28−30 Electrospinning provides
a versatile and simple method for generating 1D nanofibers from an
abundant variety of materials including synthetic and natural polymers,
polymers loaded with chromophores, polymer alloys, active agents,
metals, and ceramics.31−33 As a reliable and predictable approach, electrospinning
can also used to effectively prepare a desirable fibrous membrane,
which has an active laccase encapsulated inside and nanoscale channels
distributed on the surface, and can be used for direct sorption of
organic or inorganic contaminations from environmental water owing
to their porous structures, high specific surface area, interconnectivity,
and excellent mechanical properties.34,35

Alternative
materials derived from natural resources are innovative
solutions to bring unprecedented advances for heavy metal adsorption
applications.36 Agricultural wastes, chitin,
alginate, starch, and gelatin were being developed as novel adsorbents
due to their low cost and renewability. In particular, CS has been
highlighted as a promising adsorbent because of its natural abundance,
high surface activity, physicochemical robustness, biocompatibility,
lightweight, low cost, and recyclability.37 However, it is difficult to achieve specific recognition and adsorption
of Hg(II) ion when CS was applied as a metal-ion absorbent. Moreover,
it is important to design customized adsorbents with the capacity
of self-display, which aim to facile record the adsorption data,38 because of the commonly used and reliable technique
for quantitatively assessing the absorption behavior of adsorbents
is mainly based on gravimetric/volume determination.39 Such technologies are inefficient due to the lengthy and
complex instruments required, which has limited its wide application
in the adsorption process. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop
strategies for real-time noninvasive monitoring of Hg(II) ion absorption
to minimize the uncontrollable parameters and intricate variability.

Herein, intrigued by the facile functionalization of 1D CS fibers,
we propose a green material strategy for the development of real-time
self-monitoring adsorbents that can address the aforementioned challenges.
Specifically, we present a new class of porous adsorbents with synergistically
coupled magnetic fluorescence bifunctionality. The adsorbents are
composed of Fe3O4 and carbon quantum dots (CQDs)-functionalized
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/CS thin nonwovens. The NPs are evenly integrated
with the PEO/CS nanofibers by electrospinning technique (Figure 1). The CS molecules
can readily coordinate with NPs to CS/NPs complexes due to their electron-rich
amine groups in an array of π-conjugated geometries. The CQDs
were used as fluorescent probe for continuous and noninvasive monitoring
of the adsorption of Hg(II) ions, which possess excellent photoluminescence
(PL), high chemical stability, photostability, and zero toxicity.
The Fe3O4 NPs were applied as synergistic adsorbent
and magnetic function module. Furthermore, the magnetic fluorescent
nonwoven absorbent also holds great potential for applications in
luminescent patterning, underwater fluorescent devices, sensors, and
biomaterials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology of Fe3O4,
CQDs, and Composite Nanofiber Membranes
The morphology of
magnetic NPs, CQDs, PEO/CS, Fe3O4/PEO/CS, CQDs/PEO/CS,
and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS composite nanofiber membranes
were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis,
whose results are shown in Figure 2. As seen, the CQDs exhibited an irregular surface
and an average diameter of approximately 5 nm (Figure 2a). The Fe3O4 NPs were
an approximately spherical particle with a size of 8 nm, which were
evenly dispersed in aqueous solution (Figure 2b). The relatively smooth and uniform PEO/CS
nanofibers were fabricated on the collector with an average diameter
of 102 nm and a length longer than 500 μm (Figure 2c). After incorporation of
4% Fe3O4 or 4% CQDs into the PEO/CS nanofibers,
the diameter of nanofibers was slightly decreased to 95 or 98 nm,
respectively. When two solid particles were added simultaneously at
a total mass ratio of 8%, the diameter of nanofibers was decreased
to 61.1 nm. This can be explained by the increase in the electrical
conductivity of electrospinning precursor solutions.40 The average diameter was slightly increased to 64.3 nm
when the solid contents increased to 12%, which may be attributed
to the uniform dispersion of solid particles and the formation of
multiple-pore structures. Meanwhile, the nanofiber membranes exhibited
a more smooth appearance and a more uniform diameter. When the particle
content was higher than 12%, obvious particle protrusions emerged
on the surface of the nanofiber membrane, and more branches appeared
in one single nanofiber; thus, the homogeneity of nanofibers was greatly
reduced. This is potentially because the excessive Fe3O4/CQDs induced low viscosity and low interfacial tension of
electrospinning precursor solutions. Figure S1 show the relationship between solution viscosity and the corresponding
fiber diameter after adding different amounts of NPs, which indicated
that the average diameter of nanofibers increases with increase in
viscosity. In addition, the Fe3O4 NPs play an
important role in dispersing of CQDs because the particle distribution
in Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers is better than
in CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers.

Figure 3a
shows
the degree of swelling of PEO/CS nanofiber membrane and its composites.
As seen, the degree of swelling of the membranes was decreased after
doping CQDs, which could be attributed to the formation of amide linkages
between the free amino groups of CS and the carboxyl groups on the
surface of CQDs, which were confirmed via Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra in the figure. After composing Fe3O4, the degree of swelling further reduced, which could be explained
by the electrostatic interaction between the magnetic particles and
the CS molecular chain.40 These linkages
can lead to adjacent fiber segments to fuse to each other, increase
water diffusivity resistance, and decline the degree of swelling of
composited nanofibers, which was beneficial to enhance the stability
of the electrospinning membranes in the aqueous solution.

Figure 3b shows
the XRD patterns of CQDs, Fe3O4, CS, PEO powders,
PEO/CS, Fe3O4/PEO/CS, and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS composite fibers. As seen, the CQDs had a broad
peak at 2θ = 26° assigned to the amorphous carbon structure,
which was consistent with the previous reports.41 Because CS is a typical amorphous polymer, the XRD pattern
of CS only had a significant discrete broad diffraction peak at 2θ
= 20.6°, confirming that only Form II crystals are present in
the chitosan powder. There were three diffraction peaks at 2θ
= 19.4, 20, and 23.5° assigned to the characteristic peaks of
CS and PEO. The diffraction peaks appearing in Fe3O4/PEO/CS at 2θ = 30.11, 35.41, 43.11, 53.41, 57.01, and
62.61° can correspond to the crystal planes of (220), (311),
(400), (422), (511), and (440) of magnetite Fe3O4 (JCPDS11-0614), respectively. The characteristic diffraction peaks
of CQDs was not present in the patterns of CQDs/PEO/CS and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers, which indicated the
good dispersion of CQDs in the nanocomposite.42

To investigate the pore volume, pore diameter, and surface
area
of the nanofiber membranes, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) adsorption/desorption isotherms (Figure 3c) were characterized. The pore-size distribution
of different samples are demonstrated in Figure S2 and the corresponding surface texture characteristics are
summarized in Table S1. All nanofibers
exhibited typical type IV isotherms with an H2-type hysteresis
loop, which was the characteristic of mesoporous materials. As seen,
both pristine Fe3O4 and CQDs exhibited a unimodal
pore size distribution; however, the BET surface area of CQDs was
slightly higher than that of Fe3O4 due to their
amorphous carbon structure. Compared with the pristine PEO/CS fiber,
the addition of Fe3O4 or CQDs could improve
the specific surface area, average pore diameter, and pore volume.
When the Fe3O4 and CQDs was added in the nanofibers
simultaneously, the BET surface area increased from 32.281 to 38.234
m2g−1. This indicated that the co-addition
of magnetic particles and carbon materials produces a synergistic
effect in improving the surface texture, which facilitated the improvement
in physical adsorption abilities of the membranes.

The FT-IR
spectra of Fe3O4, CQDs, PEO/CS,
Fe3O4/PEO/CS, CQDs/PEO/CS, and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS composite fibers are exhibited in Figure 3d. As could be seen,
the Fe3O4 spectrum exhibited the characteristic
absorption peaks of Fe–O–Fe at 595 cm–1. The CQDs spectrum manifested two obvious absorption peaks at 1710
and 1388 cm–1, the former corresponded to the asymmetric
vibrational peaks and symmetrical vibrational peaks of −COOH,
which indicated that the carboxyl group was contained on the surface
of the CQDs, whereas the latter corresponded to the −CH2 group. In the spectrum of PEO/CS, the peak at 1635 cm–1 was assigned to the deformation vibration of −NH2, the broad band at 3200–3400 cm–1 was attributed to the stretching vibration absorption band of N–H
and O–H of the polysaccharide molecules, the absorption band
at 1350–1460 cm–1 was due to the vibration
of −CH2, the peak at 1635 cm–1 was due to the C=C absorption band, and the broad band at
∼1093 cm–1 was associated with the C–O–C
stretching vibration. These structures further confirmed the successive
composition of CS and PEO. The FT-IR spectra of Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS composite membrane maintained the characteristic
peaks of Fe3O4 and CQDs without apparent migration,
which indicated that Fe3O4 or CQDs are immobilized
in nanofibers. In addition, minor peaks at 1630 and 1580 cm–1 can be observed in CQDs/PEO/CS and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS
composites, which can be attributed to the formation of amide linkages
between the free amino groups of CS and the carboxyl groups on the
surface of CQDs.41

Optical properties
of samples were characterized via UV–vis
diffuse-reflectance spectrum (UV–vis DRS) (Figure S3). The PEO and CS exhibited a strong sorption in
the ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet region with a wavelength of less
than 500 nm, which can be assigned to intrinsic absorption of CS and
PEO molecular chains. The CQDs had two strong absorption bands, the
peaks that occurred at 234–271 nm could be ascribed to π
→ π* transitions of aromatic rings and n → π*
transitions of the C=O bonds; the minor peak at ∼450
nm was probably due to the trapping of excited states from the surface
states.43 The UV–vis DRS of Fe3O4, Fe3O4/PEO/CS, CQDs/PEO/CS,
and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS exhibited similar absorption
spectral profiles at 200–800 nm, which may contain the characteristic
absorption range of polymer, CQDs, and/or magnetic materials.

Figure 4a shows
the PL intensity of CQDs/PEO/CS and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS
nanofiber membranes at excitation wavelengths of 420 nm with different
solid particle contents (the corresponding fluorescence spectra are
demonstrated in Figures S4 and S5, respectively).
The CQDs/PEO/CS nanofiber membranes showed the excitation wavelength
dependence similar to CQDs. With the increase in CQDs content from
4 to 16%, the fluorescence intensity of the nanofiber membranes first
increased and then decreased, which may be attributed to the overall
fluorescence intensity being relatively weak at low CQDs concentration,
and a significant fluorescence quenching existed in the nanofibers
at excessively high CQDs concentration. To investigate the effect
of Fe3O4 on the fluorescence properties of CQDs,
we studied the change in fluorescence intensity versus Fe3O4 contents. The fluorescence intensity of the nanofiber
membranes generally decreased after doping Fe3O4, which was partly due to the shielding effect of Fe3O4. However, the membranes with a lower CQDs content exhibited
a higher sensitivity; the fluorescence intensity of membrane with
4% CQDs declined 62.5%, whereas that of the membrane with 8% CQDs
declined 11.1%. This can be explained by the fact that the addition
of Fe3O4 reduced the collision and fluorescence
quenching in nanofibers.40 This phenomenon
illustrated the dual effect of Fe3O4 on the
fluorescence intensity of CQDs, which are the shielding and dispersion
effects.

Figure 4 PL intensity (a) and magnetic properties (b) of different membranes
with different solid particle content (the UV excitation wavelength
is 420 nm).

The magnetic properties
of Fe3O4/PEO/CS and
Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS composite membranes are shown
in Figure 4b. As could
be seen, the magnetic composite membranes had almost immeasurable
remanence and coercivity, which demonstrated their superparamagnetic
behavior. With the increase in the addition amount of Fe3O4, the saturated magnetic strength of the composite nanofibers
was approximately linearly increased, and the saturated magnetic intensity
varied with Fe3O4 content as y = 54.2013x + 0.5287. When the Fe3O4 content increased to 8%, the saturation magnetic strength
can reach 18.61 emu g–1. In general, when the magnetic
saturation magnetization reaches 16.3 emu g–1, the
magnetic material has the potential to be driven by permanent magnets,
indicating that we have successfully fabricated a class of magnetically
separable membranes.44

To obtain
the composition information of the nanofiber membranes
and their thermal stability, we tested the thermogravimetric curves
of the composite membranes containing different contents of CQDs and
Fe3O4 NPs in the N2 atmosphere. As
seen in Figure S6a, the weight loss of
the PEO/CS nanofiber membranes near the 100 °C is 3%, which could
be ascribed to the decomposition of water on the surface of the nanofiber
membranes. The second-stage weight loss platform was at 290–310
°C, with a weight loss of approximately 20%, which could be due
to the decomposition of CS. The major weight loss of approximately
60% occurring at 310–450 °C could be assigned to the decomposition
of PEO. The corresponding DTA curve showed two salient peaks at 293
and 427 °C, which corresponded to the maximum heat flow of CS
and PEO in the exothermic process, respectively. As seen in Figure S6b–d, the four element hybridizations
had several significant thermal decomposition platforms at 200–600
°C, the thermal decomposition materials included CQDs (200–600
°C), PEO (310–450 °C), and CS (290–310 °C).
With the increase in CQDs/Fe3O4 contents from
8 to 16%, the weight loss rate gradually decreased from 73.6 to 66.1%;
meanwhile, the mass of the residual material increased from 23.4 to
30.9%. In addition, after Fe3O4/CQDs composition,
the decomposition peak of CS moved to a higher temperature, whereas
the decomposition peak of PEO maintained its position, which indicates
that some weak physical or chemical bonds may be formed between the
NPs and CS. In general, the addition of Fe3O4/CQDs can improve the thermal stability of the nanofiber membranes,
which was beneficial to realizing the commercialization of the absorbents.

2.2 Removal of Hg(II) Ions under Real-Time Fluorescence
Monitoring
The effect of pH and Fe3O4/CQDs concentration on the Hg(II) ions sorption using Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers was investigated for the initial
concentration of 100 mg L–1, adsorbent dosage of
0.5 g L–1, and temperature of 25 °C (Figure S7). As depicted, the Hg(II) sorption
capacity decreased by increasing pH values from 3 to 8. At lower pH
values, the amine groups on the adsorbent surfaces were easily protonated
and positively charged, which resulted in an electrostatic repulsion
of Hg(II) ions. Meanwhile, the competition between the Hg(II) ions
and hydrogen ion in the solution for active adsorption sites was intensive.
However, at higher pH values, adsorbent surface was deprotonated and
the presence of hydrogen ion in the solution decreased, which induced
an increase in the adsorption amount of metal ions. Due to the low
solubility of mercury hydroxide in an alkaline solution, it often
formed an orange precipitate and further transformed to HgO state.17 When the pH values were higher than 7.0, the
formation of the precipitate could decrease the adsorption capacity
for Hg(II) ions. So, the maximum adsorption capacity was found at
pH 7.0.45 The particle contents also have
a non-negligible effect on the sorption efficiency (Figure S7) by increasing the Fe3O4/CQDs
concentration up to 12%; further increase in Fe3O4/CQDs content can decrease the adsorption capacity of Hg(II) ions
onto the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers. Increase
in the adsorption capacity could be attributed to the increase in
the number of active sites on the nanofibers adsorbent due to the
unique large surface, well-modified surface properties provided by
NPs. Reduction in Hg(II) ions sorption at higher particle concentrations
could be ascribed to the agglomeration of Fe3O4/CQDs. Thus, in the following study, a pH value of 7.0 and a solid
particle content of 6% were chosen as research conditions.

The
effect of contact time on the adsorption capacity of Hg(II) ions onto
the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS composite nanofibers and
their fluorescent quenching degree are shown in Figure 5b,c. As seen, the adsorption of mercury ions
onto the adsorbent reached an equilibrium after only 100 min at the
researched temperatures; 80% of the adsorption occurs in the first
60 min. This relationship of cumulative adsorption capacity and fluorescence
quenching degree was established via linear fitting (Figure 5c); the relatively high integral
regression correlation coefficients (R2 > 0.983) indicated the linear correlation between fluorescence
intensity
and the cumulative adsorption capacity. Moreover, the uniformity of
the solid particle distribution exhibited a distinct facilitation
effect on the fitting results. One can see that membrane 1 (6% Fe3O4 and 6% CQDs) shows the best linear fitting degree
(R2 > 0.993) compared to membrane 2
(4%
Fe3O4 and 4% CQDs) and membrane 3 (8% Fe3O4 and 8% CQDs). This can be explained by the fact
that uneven distribution of CQDs can lead to irregular fluorescence
quenching during the Hg(II) ion adsorption process. As reported, the
CQDs can be employed as a sensitive and selective fluorescent probe
for quantitative detection of Hg(II) ions, but they have a definite
super-low detection limit around the nanomolar level.46 However, the as-prepared magnetic fluorescent nanofibers
have the potential for real-time fluorescence, self-displaying the
adsorption process even under high concentration of mercury ions.
This is mainly attributed to the even distribution and homogeneous
fluorescence quenching of CQDs in nanofibers. When Hg(II) ions gradually
adsorb and diffuse into the interior of the nanofibers, the fluorescence
of CQDs was gradually quenched, thus a certain relationship between
the fluorescence intensity and the adsorption capacity of Hg(II) ions
can be established.

PL intensity versus accumulative adsorption capacity. (d) Effect of
competitive ions on fluorescence quenching degree (I/I0, I0,
and I are the initial and final fluorescence intensity,
respectively).

The effect of competitive
ions, including Ag(I), Zn(II), Cu(II),
Cd(II), Fe(II), Ba(II), Pb(II), Mn(II), Ca(II), Mg(II), Cr(III), Fe(III),
and Cr(VI), on fluorescence quenching degree was studied to confirm
the selectivity of the fluorescence monitoring, whose results are
shown in Figure 5d.
The results proved that metal ions, such as Ag(I), Cr(VI), Pb(II),
Cu(II), and Fe(III), could cause slight quenching, but to a relatively
lower degree, whereas other metal ions had no obvious effect on the
fluorescence intensity of nanofibers. These results indicated that
the nanofibers were selective monitoring system for Hg(II) ions in
the presence of other cations.

The application of detecting
Hg(II) ion in real samples of rainwater
was carried out by using an analogous procedure. The mercury concentration
in the original rainwater samples was determined by ICP-AES to be
0.202 μg L–1, which is much lower than the
ion concentration we added. Figure S8 exhibits
the photos of membrane 1 under UV excitation (420 nm) at different
adsorption times. As seen, the fluorescence intensity of the nanofiber
membranes decreased gradually with increase in the adsorption time,
and the fluorescence was almost completely quenched at about 150 min.
This could be because when the mercury ions gradually mass-transferred
toward the interior of the nanofibers, the mercury ions could bind
to the surface of the CQDs at different positions until all CQDs inside
the nanofibers were completely quenched. The linear fitting results
(Figure S9) showed the fluorescence intensity
had a good linear correlation with the cumulative adsorption capacity
in rainwater (R2 = 0.992), which indicated
that these nanofiber membranes could be extensively applied in actual
activities.

2.3 Equilibrium, Kinetics,
and Thermodynamics
The sorption capacity of nanofibers versus
the initial concentration
of Hg(II) ions and temperatures are shown in Figure 6a. The equilibrium data of Hg(II) ions adsorption
onto the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers were described
via Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The parameters of isotherm
models, which were calculated via linear regression, are shown in Figure 6b–d and summarized
in Table S2. As seen, the Langmuir isotherm
model (R2 > 0.994) was more suitable
than
Freundlich (R2 > 0.958) isotherm model
to describe the equilibrium data. This behavior suggested the monolayer
adsorption process of Hg(II) ions onto Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibers. Thermodynamic parameters including enthalpy
change (ΔH), entropy change (ΔS), and Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) usually play a vital role in determining the degrees of feasibility
and spontaneity of the sorption process. ΔG of the adsorption process can be reckoned by eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  where R is the gas constant
(8.314 J mol–1 K–1), T is an absolute temperature (K), kc is
the adsorption equilibrium constant, and ces and cel are the values of solid and
liquid phase concentration in equilibrium (mg L–1), respectively. The relationship between the equilibrium constant
(kc) and the temperature can be calculated
by the Van’t Hoff equation (eq 3). 3  The values of ΔS and
ΔH can be obtained from the slope and intercept
of the Van’t Hoff plot of ln kc versus 1/T (Figure 6d). The thermodynamic parameters are summarized
in Table S3. The endothermic and spontaneous
features of mercury ions adsorption onto the nanofibrous adsorbent
could be confirmed by the positive values of ΔH and negative values of ΔG. Furthermore, the
positive values of ΔS indicated the increased
randomness at the solid–solution interface.

Hg(II) ions sorption onto Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS
nanofibrous adsorbent (a). The linear fitting
results of Langmuir models (b), Freundlich models (c), and Van’t
Hoff equation (d).

The typical pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order kinetic
models and intraparticle diffusion models were applied to describe
the kinetic data of Hg(II) ions onto the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofiber adsorbent (6% CQDs and 6% Fe3O4) in Figure 5b. The linear fitting results are presented in Figure 7a–c and Table S3. As shown, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R2 > 0.993) could well describe the kinetic
data
of Hg(II) ions adsorbed by the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS
nanofibers compared with pseudo-first-order kinetic model (R2 > 0.980) and intraparticle diffusion models
(R2 > 0.980). This indicated that the
adsorption was a rapid process, which was mainly controlled by chemical
adsorption. Furthermore, the intraparticle diffusion mass transfer
resistance was not obvious in this system, which further proved the
uniform adsorption and even fluorescence quenching in nanofibers.
Under optimum conditions, the adsorption capacity of CQDs, Fe3O4/PEO/CS, CQDs/PEO/CS, and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS adsorbents for Hg(II) ions was determined. The
results exhibited that the maximum experimental adsorption capacity
of Hg(II) ions onto different adsorbents was in order Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS (108 mg g–1) > Fe3O4/PEO/CS (94 mg g–1) > CQDs/PEO/CS
(88 mg g–1) > CS (79 mg g–1) nanofibrous
adsorbents. Therefore, the composition of CQDs and Fe3O4 has a synergistic effect on the enhancement of sorption capacity
to the nanofibrous adsorbents.

kinetic model
(a), pseudo-second-order kinetic model (b), and intraparticle diffusion
model (c). (d) Five cycles of metal ions adsorption/desorption with
1 M HNO3 and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
respectively.

The results of five cycles
of adsorption/desorption of Hg(II) ions
onto the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS nanofibrous adsorbent
is illustrated in Figure 7d, which showed that the Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS
nanofibrous adsorbent can be reused frequently without significant
loss in fluorescence intensity and sorption capacity. After five cycles,
the saturated adsorption capacity of mercury ions decreased by 12.4%
and the fluorescence intensity decreased by 12.9%. The possible reason
was the erosion of the active adsorption sites by HNO3 and
the change in the surface structure of CQDs, respectively.

3 Conclusions
A magnetic fluorescence nanofiber membrane
had been strategically
prepared by immobilizing CQDs and Fe3O4 into
PEO/CS nanofibers via electrospinning to effectively the remove the
mercury ions existing in water. The nanofibers membrane exhibited
a high adsorption efficiency for the mercury ions as the synergistic
effects of polymer materials and inorganic nanoparticles. The mercury
ions’ sorption achieved an equilibrium within 100 min and the
maximum monolayer sorption capacity was 148.148 mg g–1. On the basis of the good linear relationship between the adsorption
capacity of mercury ions and the fluorescence intensity of membranes,
we developed a facile method for real-time and noninvasively tracking
of adsorption. The results of equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics
experiment indicated that adsorption was a rapid process and mainly
controlled by chemisorption. The presence of Fe3O4 in the membrane also facilitates the separation of the nonwoven
membrane from the solution, thus this nonwoven membrane has a great
potential for the application in actual wastewater.

4 Methods
l-Valine (Val), phosphoric acid, NaOH,
FeCl2, FeCl3, ethanol, K2SO4, K3PO4, K2CO3, Hg(NO3)2, AgNO3, ZnCl2, CuSO4, CdCl2, BaCl2, Pb(NO3)2, MnCl2, CaCl2, MgCl2, Cr2(SO4)3, and K2Cr2O7 were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
(Beijing, China).
Poly(ethylene oxide) (average Mw 900 kDa)
and Chitosan (average Mw 200 kDa) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dialysis tubing with a flat diameter
of 28 mm and a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 1 kDa were provided
by Biotopped (Viskase). Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.2
MΩ was provided by a GWA-UN water purification system. All materials
and chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without
further purification.

4.1 Instruments and Analyses
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were conducted
via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore-size
distribution analyzer (Quantachrome NOVA-4000e) at 77 K. The TEM images
were obtained using a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM, TECNAI G2 F20) and operated at the accelerating voltage of
the electron beam of 200 kV. The diameter distributions and the average
diameters of nanofibers were measured via an image analyzer (Image-Proplus,
Media Cybernetics). Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted under
a nitrogen atmosphere flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 (NETZSCH STA 409/PC). The magnetic properties were
measured on a 7407 vibrating sample magnetometer (Lakeshore Instrument
Plant) in the range of −15 000–15 000
Oe at room temperature. The PL spectra data were determined using
a steady-state Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer; the excitation
wavelength was selected at 320–500 nm. The FT-IR spectra were
recorded on a Spectrum Two FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) in the
range of 200–4000 cm–1 with 4 scans. The
UV–vis DRS were determined on a U-3900 spectrometer with a
D2 (deuterium) lamp for the ultraviolet range and a WI (halogen) lamp
for the visible and near-infrared regions, respectively.

4.2 Synthesis of CQDs and Fe3O4 NPs
The CQDs were fabricated via thermal treatment
of Val according to a method reported earlier.46 The general procedure is exhibited as follows: 1 mL aqueous
Val solution (100 mg mL–1) and 2 mL concentrated
phosphoric acid were mixed and heated for 4 h at 90 °C. The obtained
brown solution obtained was neutralized to pH 7 using 1 M NaOH solution
and filtered through a 0.45 μm polyethersulphone membrane to
remove insoluble particles. The CQDs were further purified via dialyzing
against deionized water (MWCO 1 kDa) for 48 h. The Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized by a reported high-gravity reactive
precipitation method by intense microscopic mixing of NaOH, FeCl2, and FeCl3 at 80 °C.10 Briefly, FeCl2 and FeCl3 were dissolved in
deionized water at a molar ratio of 1:2, and then the obtained solution
was chemically precipitated by 30% NaOH solution in impact stream-rotating
packed bed under the protection of nitrogen. The suspension was separated
using a magnet and washed several times using ethanol and deionized
water until the pH value of the filtrate was neutral.

4.3 Preparation of Nanocomposite Fibers
The preparation
process of magnetic fluorescent nonwovens was showed
as follow; first, CS and PEO (w/w = 1:1) were dissolved in the mixed
solvent of water and acetic acid (v/v = 1:1) to obtain a mixed solution
with a solid concentration of 5%. After stirring for 24 h, the CQDs
and Fe3O4 were dispersed in the transparent
solution at a mass ratio of 1:1 and then the mixture was stirred for
another 2 h to obtain a brown uniform solution. After standing and
defoaming for 24 h, the solution was loaded into a 5 mL plastic syringe
equipped with a syringe needle of 0.9 mm inner diameter. The nanofibers
membrane with magnetic fluorescence properties was prepared via electrospinning
(TEADFS-100+, Beijing Technova Technology, Co. Ltd, China) at a voltage
of 22 kV, a tip-collector distance of 10 cm, a feeding rate of 0.5
mL h–1, and an air humidity less than 10% at room
temperature. The prepared nanofiber membranes were stored in a vacuum
oven before use. For comparisons, the spinning solution without the
solid particles or with only one kind of particles is also configured
for electrospinning.

4.4 Swelling Studies of Nanofiber
Membranes
To discuss the stability of composite nanofiber
membranes in an
aqueous solution, the degree of swelling was investigated on the PEO/CS-based
nanofiber membranes. Typically, dry membranes were immersed in 25
°C deionized water for 24 h. The experiments continued until
the weight of the membranes generally remained stable. The degree
of swelling was calculated expressed as the masses increase versus
the mass of dried nanofibers.

4.5 Real-Time
Fluorescence Monitored Adsorption
Experiment
The pre-prepared PEO/CS, Fe3O4/PEO/CS, CQDs/PEO/CS, and Fe3O4/CQDs/PEO/CS
nanofibers were applied as adsorbents for the removal of Hg(II) ions
from the aqueous system. All batch sorption experiments were performed
on a model THZ-82(A) shaker (Jiangsu Kexi Instrument Co., Ltd., China)
with a shaking speed of 200 rpm. The concentration of mercury ions
in the solution was determined by ICP-AES (Model ICAP 9000, Jarrell-Ash).
The sorption capacity of the metal ions adsorbed onto each adsorbent
was calculated via following equation. 4  where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium
concentrations
of the Hg(II) ions in the testing solution (mg L–1), V is the volume of the testing solution (L),
and W is the mass of the adsorbent (g). The adsorption
kinetics of the Hg(II) ions onto the nanofibers were determined with
an initial concentration of 100 mg L–1, pH values
of 2–7, a temperature of 25 °C, and lasted for 150 min.
Meanwhile, the PL spectra data of different membranes during adsorption
were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 420 nm after rapid magnetic
separation. The selectivity was confirmed by adding other analogues,
including Ag(I), Zn(II), Cu(II), Cd(II), Fe(II), Ba(II), Pb(II), Mn(II),
Ca(II), Mg(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), and Cr(VI) instead of Hg(II) after
150 min adsorption. Pseudo-first-order47 and pseudo-second-order kinetic48 and
intraparticle diffusion models40 were employed
to analyze the sorption data (eqs 5–7). 5   6   7  where qe and qt (both mg g–1) are the sorption
capacity at equilibrium time and time t, respectively; k1 (min–1), k2 (g mg–1 min–1),
and ki (mg g–1 min–1) are the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second-order,
and intraparticle diffusion sorption rate constants, respectively;
and C is the intraparticle diffusion adsorption constant.

The adsorption isotherm experiment was carried out with different
initial concentrations (10–200 mg L–1), contact
time (0–150 min), and temperature (25–45 °C). Acetic
acid (0.1 M) or NaOH were used to adjust the pH value. Freundlich
and Langmuir isotherm model49,50 (eqs 8 and 9) were applied
to analyze the equilibrium data.40 8   9  where kL is the
Langmuir equilibrium constant, kF and n are the Freundlich equilibrium constants, and qm is the maximum sorption capacity. For the
regeneration of the nanofiber membranes, the nanofibers were washed
with 1 mol L–1 HNO3, 1 mM EDTA, and then
washed several times with deionized water. The adsorption/desorption
cycle was repeated four times using the same nanofiber membranes.
