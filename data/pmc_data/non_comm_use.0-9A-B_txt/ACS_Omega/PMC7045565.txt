The
reaction between an iridium(III)
solvent complex and the histidine site of biomolecules as one kind
of novel bioconjugation approaches has received much attention during
the past few years. To extend this novel bioconjugation approach into
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay and optimize the performances,
three iridium(III) solvent complexes with different C∧N bidentate main ligands have been designed and synthesized in this
work. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard histidine-rich protein
is initially employed to evaluate the labeling performances by comparing
the ECL intensity of the same amount of BSA labeled by different iridium(III)
solvent complexes. Importantly, a magnetic
beads-based sandwich immunoassay platform using Ir-dmpq (iridium(III)
acetonitrile complex with 2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinoline as the main
ligand) as a structurally optimized labeling agent has been successfully
constructed to detect C-reactive protein (CRP, an important biomarker
of systemic inflammation in clinic), and the limit of detection based
on this novel labeling agent could reach below 1 ng/mL, which may
further pave the way for applications of the iridium(III) solvent
complex in histidine-rich protein ECL labeling beyond fluorescence
labeling.

Introduction
Developing novel luminescence
labeling approaches and corresponding
excellent luminescent labels is always one of the significant issues
in biochemistry and related fields.1−3 In the past few decades,
owing to their excellent luminescence
properties, iridium(III) complexes have received much attention and
have been developed into reliable luminescent probes for various biomolecules.4−7 Notably, one kind of nonemissive iridium(III) solvent complex, Irppy2(MeCN)2+ (ppy is 2-phenylpyridine, MeCN
demonstrates acetonitrile, Ir-ppy in this work), was initially reported
as a fluorescent switch-on probe for histidine and histidine-rich
proteins by Ma et al.8 The revealed mechanism
is that the solvent ligand of the original iridium(III) complex could
be substituted with histidine and a new emissive histidine-bound iridium(III)
complex is on-site re-formed accordingly.8,9 The
possible coordination types between histidine and the iridium(III)
center have also been further demonstrated in detail by Wang et al.9 Meanwhile, Li et al. synthesized a dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-coordinated iridium(III) complex, Irppy2(DMSO)2+, to specially light up nuclei of living cells
based on the proposed histidine-binding mechanism.10 Subsequently, this novel bioconjugation method demonstrated
various applications, such as imaging of subcellular organelles,11,12 multiplex assays of cell death,13 differentiating
free amino acids from biomolecules containing the same amino acids,14 and luminescence labeling of cyclized peptides.9,15 However, these studies are all dependent on the changes of photoluminescent
(PL) signals specifically occurring upon binding of histidine residues
to an iridium(III) solvent complex.

Electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) is defined as the emission of light
generated on an electrode through the electrochemical formation of
excited species.16 Due to the advantages
of high sensitivity, low noise, and signal specificity,17 ECL-based analytic systems have achieved great
success in clinical diagnostic markets currently. However, taking
into account the disadvantages of the low quantum efficiency and hardly
tunable emission colors for the ruthenium-based labels widely used
in the commercial equipment, novel kinds of nonruthenium metal complexes
are extensively explored for ECL applications in the academic field,
including iridium(III) complexes,18,19 platinum(II)
complexes,20 and others.21 Though novel ECL luminophores have achieved great advances
in the past few years,22 there is still
scarcity of innovations in the bioconjugation approaches between ECL
luminophores and biomolecules.

Taking into account the advantages
of ECL over PL in analytical
applications, we initially investigated ECL signal changes upon the
addition of histidine to the solution of Ir(ppy)2(MeCN)2+ and developed Ir(ppy)2(MeCN)2+ as an efficient and specific ECL probe for histidine
over other amino acids. This study directly proved that the ECL signals
of histidine-bound iridium(III) complexes could be obviously detected
in commercially available ECL buffers.23 Very recently, Zhou and Xia24 have shown
ECL immunoassay applications of the solvent complex Ir(ppy)2(MeCN)2+ as a novel protein ECL labeling agent,
which further strongly demonstrated more attractive prospects of iridium(III)
solvent complexes in ECL labeling applications.

After reviewing
the related literature,8,10,15 this innovative labeling method is almost
entirely limited to the original iridium(III) complex with 2-phenylpyridine
ligand as the main ligand, such as Ir(ppy)2(MeCN)2+, Ir(ppy)2(H2O)2+, and Ir(ppy)2(DMSO)2+. Obviously,
the following labeling performances (including emission color and
quantum efficiency) largely relied on the on-site-formed emissive
complex of Ir(ppy)2(His)+ (His represents the
histidine residues of the biomolecules, such as peptides and proteins).
It is well known that the emission color and quantum efficiency are
seriously related to the main ligand of the iridium(III) complex.25,26 Specifically, the luminescence performances of the on-site-formed
iridium(III) complex, i.e., Ir(C∧N)2(His)+, could be optimized by changing the main ligand of the original
complex of Ir(C∧N)2(solvent)2+ (solvent is MeCN, H2O, or DMSO). Herein,
three iridium(III) solvent complexes with different C∧N bidentate ligands (shown in Figure 1) have been rationally designed and successfully synthesized
in this work. The structure design principle, photophysical properties,
and the frontier orbital calculations have been thoroughly characterized.
Most importantly, the ECL performance and the following magnetic bead-based
sandwich immunoassay for the C-reactive protein (CRP) detection have
been investigated in this work. The structurally optimized label would
further promote the development of innovative histidine-binding labeling
techniques in expanding related fields.

complexes used in this work.

Results
and Discussion
Design and Synthesis
Taking into
account the dramatical
needs of multicolor labels in the further developments of analytical
techniques, ECL labels with tunable colors came to our major concerns
in designing chemical structures of iridium(III) solvent complexes.
According to the revealed relationships between the luminescence properties
and chemical structures of iridium(III) complexes, the strategies
of adjusting the conjugation degree and incorporating substituents
with different electronic effects are finally adopted in this work.
As shown in Figure 1, 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy),
and 2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinoline (dmpq) have been selected as the
C∧N main ligand to construct iridium(III) solvent
complexes in this work. In particular, the ligand of dmpq has been
proved to be an excellent main ligand to design highly efficient ECL
dyes in our former studies,27,28 which encouraged us
to further synthesize the corresponding solvent complex of Ir-dmpq
in this work. Notably, though new iridium(III) complexes would be
re-formed through solvent ligand substitution of histidine-rich biomolecules
in the following labeling applications, these selected main ligands
still remained in the skeleton of the re-formed luminophores and the
strategy used in this work remained reasonable.

The synthesis
procedures of these complexes are detailed in the Experimental Section. Briefly, the dichloro-bridged iridium(III)
dimer is first obtained by the reaction of iridium(III) chloride hydrate
and the C∧N main ligand, while the next step is
to synthesize the corresponding acetonitrile coordinated iridium(III)
complexes under the assistance of AgBF4 in acetonitrile
solutions. Finally, NMR (Figures S1–S6 in the Supporting Information) and time-of-flight mass spectra (TOF-MS)
(Figures S7–S9 in the Supporting
Information) characterizations have been used to identify the chemical
structures of these iridium(III) solvent complexes. Notably, due to
the low forces of the coordination band of acetonitrile in these labels,
there are no molecular ion peaks recorded for Ir-dmpq and Ir-ppy,
while the fragmental peaks at 698.2123 and 501.0930 should be reasonably
ascribed to the decomposition of one acetonitrile ligand and two acetonitrile
ligands for the cationic part of Ir-dmpq and Ir-ppy, respectively.
Fortunately, the molecular ion peak of Ir-dfppy located at 655.1072
has been successfully detected though the intensity is very weak.

Photophysical Properties
The photophysical properties
have been thoroughly investigated before the ECL-based analytical
applications. Figure 2A shows the absorption spectra of these iridium(III) solvent complexes
in acetonitrile solution at room temperature. All of these iridium(III)
solvent complexes have intense intraligand π–π*
transition bands located below 300 nm and a moderate band of metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (MLCT) falling into the region between 300 and 500
nm. Similar to other reported iridium(III) complexes, there is almost
no absorption band above 600 nm. Moreover, compared to the complex
of Ir-ppy, incorporating two fluoride atoms with an electron-withdrawing
effect on 2-phenypyridine would slightly result in a hypsochromic
shift of the absorption bands of Ir-dfppy, while the synergy of incorporating
an electron-donating group of −CH3 and enlarging
the π conjugation degree would prominently increase the intensity
of absorption bands of Ir-dmpq, beyond just unsurprising bathochromic
shift effect. Subsequently,
the photoluminescence properties are also characterized in an acetonitrile
solution saturated with a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature.
Most importantly, the quantum efficiency is also calculated by referring
to the standard sample of fac-Ir(ppy)3 (ΦPL = 0.40).29 All
critical photophysical data are also listed in Table 1. According to Table 1, the photoluminescence of these iridium(III)
solvent complexes is very weak (ΦPL ≈ 1%).
The normalized PL spectra as presented in Figure 2B confirmed that the emission color could
be rationally adjusted by changing the main ligand of iridium(III)
solvent complexes, which encouraged us to further carry out the following
studies and analytical applications.

Theoretical
Calculations
To understand the photophysical
properties, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) with B3LYP are further employed to investigate
the frontier orbitals of ground states and excited states of these
iridium(III) solvent complexes. In this work, the LANL2DZ basis set
is adopted for the iridium(III) atom, while the 6-31G basis set is
used for other nonmetal atoms, such as C, N, H, O, and F atoms.

Table 2 shows the
electron distributions and the corresponding energy levels of critical
frontier orbitals on the optimized ground state of iridium(III) solvent
complexes in this work. Overall, for the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and the
adjacent frontier orbitals listed in Table 2, there are very few electron distributions
on the solvent coordination ligand part of all of the three iridium(III)
solvent complexes, while concentrated electron distributions are located
on the part of the C∧N main ligand and the central
iridium(III) atom, which reasonably explained the significant role
of the main ligand of iridium(III) complexes in tuning the photophysical
properties. In comparison with Ir-ppy, the electron-withdrawing substituent
of −F on the phenyl ring of Ir-dfppy would stabilize both HOMO
and LUMO. However, due to the much larger impact on the energy level
of the HOMO rather than the LUMO, the combined effect of −F
makes the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO (ΔE) increase from 3.89 eV of Ir-ppy to 4.14 eV of Ir-dfppy. This theoretical
calculation result is also well consistent with the observed PL experimental
phenomenon of a slight hypsochromic shift of the main peaks from Ir-ppy
to Ir-dfppy in Figure 2B. However, increasing the π conjugation degree from Ir-ppy
to Ir-dmpq has yet an opposite effect on HOMO and LUMO. In detail,
through destabilization of the HOMO and stabilization of the LUMO,
the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO (ΔE) decreased
dramatically from 3.89 eV of Ir-ppy to 3.07 eV of Ir-dmpq. Accordingly,
the bathochromic shift of the PL spectra from Ir-ppy to Ir-dmpq has
also been well observed, which further indicated that the theoretical
calculation methods used in this work are quite reliable.

Table 2 Electron Distributions and Energy
Levels of Frontier Orbitals on the Optimized Ground State of Iridium(III)
Solvent Complexes in This Work
Moreover, the excited states of these iridium(III)
solvent complexes
are also investigated by TD-DFT calculations. Table 3 lists the calculated transition wavelength,
oscillator strength, and molecular orbitals involving the lowest-energy
transition of these iridium(III) solvent complexes. In combination
with electron distributions on the frontier orbitals as shown in Table 2, the singlet and
triplet states of these iridium(III) solvent complexes should be assigned
to the mixed states of intraligand (C∧N main ligand)
charge transfer (ILC∧NCT) and metal-to-ligand
(C∧N main ligand) charge transfer (MLC∧NCT). According to the results of theoretical
calculations, acetonitrile as the solvent ligand has less effect on
the excited states of iridium(III) complexes in this work. In summary,
theoretical calculation results further proved that adjusting the
chemical structures of the main ligands should be an effective approach
to tune the photophysical properties of these iridium(III) solvent
complexes.

ECL Labeling Applications
Before labeling applications,
the lipophilicities (log Po/w)
of these iridium solvent complexes have been measured and are listed
in Table 1. It is found
that all of these cationic complexes are hydrophilic. Furthermore,
incorporating two fluoride atoms induced the hydrophobicity of Ir-dfppy
increasing. According to the
labeling mechanism of the iridium(III) solvent complex,8 the ECL signal is finally related to the histidine-binding
iridium(III) complex. Herein, to reasonably investigate the ECL labeling
properties of these iridium(III) solvent complexes, bovine serum albumin
(BSA) with rich histidine residues is initially selected as the standard
protein to evaluate the properties of these novel labeling agents
based on the ECL intensity of BSA labeled using iridium(III) solvent
complexes. As shown in Figure 3A, the same amount of BSA labeled using different iridium(III)
solvent complexes displays distinct ECL intensity. According to the
intensity of the ECL signal, the labeling of Ir-dmpq outperforms that
of Ir-ppy and Ir-dfppy. Subsequently, the ECL spectra are also characterized
and listed in Figure 3B. It should be noted that there are no valid spectral data acquired
from the BSA labeled by Ir-dfppy (the concentration of BSA is 0.6
mg/mL) due to the very low ECL intensity in the commercial ECL buffers.
Meanwhile, the BSA labeled by Ir-ppy and Ir-dmpq obviously exhibited
green and red emissions centered at 488 and 618 nm, respectively,
which indicates that the final ECL performances (including the intensity
and emission wavelength) of the labeled biomolecules could be adjusted
by the main ligand of the C∧N coordination ligand.
These multicolor labeling results are also in good accordance with
the original design principles of the chemical structures of these
labels.

Figure 3 (A) ECL intensity of 0.6 mg/mL BSA labeled using different iridium(III)
solvent complexes in ProCell solutions. The applied potential is 1.4
V vs Ag/AgCl, the acquired time is 20 s, ProCell buffer (containing
tri-n-propylamine). (B) ECL spectra of BSA labeled
by Ir-ppy and Ir-dmpq.

It is well known that
the ECL intensity is usually highly related
to the electrode potential. Herein, to investigate the relationship
between the electrode potential and ECL intensity of BSA labeled by
these novel agents, various potentials from 1 to 1.8 V were applied
on the glassy carbon electrode and the ECL signals have been characterized
accordingly. As shown in Figures S10–S12 in the Supporting Information, 1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl is the best potential
for the labels of Ir-ppy and Ir-dmpq; meanwhile, the best potential
is 1.6 V vs Ag/AgCl for the agent of Ir-dfppy. These results indirectly
revealed that the re-formed ECL luminophores with different main ligands
exhibit different redox behaviors.

The excellent performance
of Ir-dmpq in BSA labeling studies encouraged
us to further implement its real application of labeling clinical
biomarkers. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a pentameric plasma protein
with homologs in vertebrates and many invertebrates that participate
in the systemic response to inflammation.30 Currently, CRP is clinically recognized as an important biomarker
for systemic inflammation. Herein, the magnetic bead-based sandwich
ECL immunoassay of CRP using Ir-dmpq as the ECL labeling agent has
been deliberately designed, and the schematic graph of the immunoassay
is also shown in Figure 4. Before employing the sandwich immunoassay as shown in Figure 4, Ir-dmpq as the
labeling agent is initially incubated with CRP antibody for 3 h and
the CRP antibody labeled with Ir-dmpq is obtained after dialysis (removing
the redundant labeling agent). Then, sandwich immunocomplexes are
formed on the surface of the magnetic beads through three major steps
as illustrated in Figure 4. Finally, after carefully transferring the immunocomplexes
into the ECL measurement cell coupled with the glassy carbon working
electrode, ECL signals are successfully generated under the assistance
of commercial ECL buffer containing tri-n-tripropylamine
(TPA) as the co-reactant.

Figure 4 Schematic graph of sandwich immunoassay for
CRP detection using
Ir-dmpq as the ECL labeling agent under the assistance of a magnet.

Based on the typical sandwich immunoassay platform
as shown in Figure 4, different concentrations
of CRP (antigen) have been employed to evaluate the properties of
the Ir-dmpq labeling agent in real-time applications. As can be seen
in Figure 5A, the intensity
of ECL signals increased along with the increase of CRP (antigen)
concentration from 0 to 600 ng/mL. The integrated ECL intensity is
linear with the logarithm of the CRP concentration (as shown in Figure 5B). At a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3, the limit of detection of the sandwich immunoassay based
on Ir-dmpq as the labeling agent could reach below 1 ng/mL. These
preliminary results demonstrated that Ir-dmpq as one kind of novel
ECL labeling agent has attractive prospects, and thus further optimization
and applications of ECL immunoassay based on Ir-dmpq as a novel labeling
agent are underway in our laboratory.

and the logarithm of the concentration of CRP (antigen).

Conclusions
In conclusion, three iridium(III) solvent
complexes with different
main ligands have been rationally designed and successfully synthesized
in this work. Through changing the main ligands, these three iridium
complexes in the following ECL labeling applications displayed various
emission colors and ECL intensities in commercially available buffers.
Furthermore, Ir-dmpq as the most efficient novel red ECL label has
also been employed to detect CRP (an important biomarker of inflammation
in clinic) based on the typical sandwich immunoassay platforms and
the limit of detection could reach below 1 ng/mL. Taking into account
the color tuning approaches of these novel ECL labels demonstrated
in this work, iridium(III) solvent complexes as novel ECL labeling
agents have great prospects to develop multichannel ECL immunoassay
systems.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Materials
Iridium(III)
chloride hydrate
was purchased from UIV Chem (Shanghai, China). 2-Phenylpyridine (ppy),
2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy), and 2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinoline
(dmpq) were obtained from commercially available sources. 2-Ethoxyethanol
and acetonitrile were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.
Ltd. The ProCell solution (Roche Diagnostics) is used as an ECL buffer
containing n-tripropyamine (TPA), in this work. Magnetic
beads with the NHS group were obtained from Beaverbio Inc. (Suzhou,
China) for sandwich Immunoassay studies. C-reactive protein (CRP,
antigen) and the corresponding antibodies were all purchased from
Cusabio (Wuhan, China).

Methods and Apparatus
NMR spectra
were recorded on
a Bruker-400 magnetic resonance spectrophotometer. The solvent signals
were used for 1H NMR (δ(CDCl3) = 7.26
ppm, δ(DMSO-d6) = 2.50 ppm, and
δ(CD3CN) = 1.94 ppm); and 13C NMR (δ(CDCl3) = 77.16 ppm, δ(DMSO-d6) = 39.52 ppm, and δ(CD3CN) = 118.26 ppm) as the
internal standard. TOF-MS was performed on an Agilent TOF spectrometer.
A three-electrode setup was used for ECL experiments. PL quantum efficiencies
(Φ) were measured in dilute acetonitrile solutions (40 μM)
and compared to fac-Ir(ppy)3 as the standard
emitter according to the equation: Φ = Φref(Is/Iref)(Aref/As), where A is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, I is the integrated intensity of the luminescence, and Φ
is the PL quantum efficiency. The subscripts s and ref refer to the
sample and standard, respectively. A glassy carbon electrode (electrode
area: 7.065 mm2) is used as the working electrode. Meanwhile,
Pt wire and Ag/AgCl in saturated potassium chloride aqueous solution
are the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode, respectively.
Before each experiment, the working electrode is all carefully polished
with alumina (0.05 μm) and sonicated in water and ethanol in
sequence. The ECL signals are all recorded on an MPI-EII ECL detector
(Xi’an Remax Electronics, China) equipped with a photomultiplier
tube (model: R9880U-20, Hamamatsu, Japan).

Lipophilicity (log Po/w)
Equal amounts of n-octanol and deionized water
were thoroughly mixed on the oscillator for 24 h. The mixture was
then kept still for a further 24 h, during which period of time the
mutually saturated water and oil phases separated. An excess amount
of iridium solvent labels was individually dissolved in n-octanol saturated deionized water. The iridium(III) saturated solutions
were then centrifuged to yield a clear solution (concentration denoted
as Co). The saturated solution was then
mixed with an equal amount of n-octanol (saturated
with deionized water) and shaken on the oscillator for another 24
h. After separation, the final concentration of iridium solvent labels
in the water phase is denoted as Cw. Both Co and Cw were measured
at an absorption intensity of 380 nm. The lipophilicity of iridium
labels was calculated according to the equation: log Po/w = log[(Co – Cw)/Cw].

Synthesis and
Characterization
Two major steps are
involved in the synthesis of iridium(III) solvent complexes in this
work. First, iridium(III) chloride hydrate (1 molar equiv) and the
corresponding main ligand (2 molar equiv) in the mixture solutions
of 2-ethoxyethanol/water (v/v = 3:1) are refluxed for 24 h under argon
atmosphere. The formed precipitate is filtrated and washed with deionized
water, methanol, and n-hexane in sequence, and then
dried over vacuum to afford the corresponding dichloro-bridged iridium(III)
dimer. Next, the dichloro-bridged iridium(III) dimer (1 molar equiv)
and AgBF4 (2 molar equiv) in acetonitrile solution are
refluxed for 12 h in the dark under an argon atmosphere. Accordingly,
chlorine in the dichloro-bridged iridium(III) dimer is replaced by
acetonitrile under the assistance of AgBF4 and the iridium(III)
solvent complex with the corresponding main ligand is finally obtained
after purification by silica gel column chromatography using acetonitrile
as an eluent. Note that chiral isomers may be formed in the synthesis.31−33

Labeling BSA with the Iridium(III)
Solvent Complex
Based on the former reported studies about
the ratio of histidine
to Ir-ppy at the luminescence enhancement saturation level 8, the
molar ratio of the iridium(III) solvent complex to BSA was finally
set to 10:1 to fully complete the labeling reaction in this work.
In detail, an aliquot of 1 mM iridium(III) solvent complex in acetonitrile
solution was diluted to 1 μM aqueous solution using PBS (pH
= 7.4). Then, the PBS solution of the iridium(III) solvent complex
and BSA with a molar ratio of 10:1 were incubated for 3 h at room
temperature. After dialysis, the labeled BSA was finally obtained.
The final concentration of the labeled BSA was determined by the bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) assay.

Labeling CRP Antibody with the Agent of Ir-dmpq
This
labeling method is similar to the aforementioned protocol of BSA labeling,
just replacing BSA with CRP antibody in respective places.

Sandwich
Immunoassay
The CRP antibody was first labeled
on the commercial magnetic beads according to the protocols shown
in the user manual of BeaverBeads Mag NHS (http://www.beaverbio.com/product/list/420.html). For sandwich immunoassay, 0.12 mg/mL of magnetic beads with the
CRP antibody (the concentration of the CRP antibody on magnetic beads
is ca. 3.6 μg/mL accordingly), a series of different concentrations
of antigen (CRP), and 3.6 μg/mL of Ir-dmpq labeled antibody
were incubated in 500 μL of PBS for 2 h at room temperature.
After washing with PBS under the assistance of a magnet, the formed
sandwich complexes were carefully transferred to the ECL measurement
cell.
