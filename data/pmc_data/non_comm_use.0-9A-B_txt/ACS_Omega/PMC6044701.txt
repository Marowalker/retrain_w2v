Aberrant
DNA methylation causes major epigenetic changes and has
been implicated in cancer following the inactivation of tumor suppressor
genes by hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands. Although methylated
DNA regions can be randomly demethylated by 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine,
site-specific inhibition of DNA methylation, for example, in the promoter
region of a specific gene, has yet to be technically achieved. Hairpin
pyrrole (Py)–imidazole (Im) polyamides are small molecules
that can be designed to recognize and bind to particular DNA sequences.
In this study, we synthesized the hairpin polyamide MLH1_–16
(Py-Im-β-Im-Im-Py-γ-Im-Py-β-Im-Py-Py) to target
a CpG site 16 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the human MLH1 gene. MLH1 is known to be frequently
silenced by promoter hypermethylation, causing microsatellite instability
and a hypermutation phenotype in cancer. We show that MLH1_–16
binds to the target site and that CpG methylation around the binding
site is selectively inhibited in vitro. MLH1_non, which does not have
a recognition site in the MLH1 promoter, neither
binds to the sequence nor inhibits DNA methylation in the region.
When MLH1_–16 was used to treat RKO human colorectal cancer
cells in a remethylating system involving the MLH1 promoter under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), methylation
of the MLH1 promoter was inhibited in the region
surrounding the compound binding site. Silencing of the MLH1 expression was also inhibited. Promoter methylation and silencing
of MLH1 were not inhibited when MLH1_non was added.
These results indicate that Py–Im polyamides can act as sequence-specific
antagonists of CpG methylation in living cells.

1 Introduction
DNA
methylation involves a modification to the cytosine at the
5 position, generally occurring within a CpG dinucleotide in adult
somatic cells.1 Unmethylated CpGs are often
grouped in clusters, called CpG islands, in the 5′ regulatory
regions of genes. In many disease processes including cancer, CpG
islands in gene promoters acquire abnormal hypermethylation that is
inherited by daughter cells via DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) during
cell division. Aberrant DNA methylation of gene promoter regions is
therefore one of the most significant epigenetic alterations, resulting
in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.2,3 A
subgroup of colorectal cancers and other malignant tumors possess
the so-called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), in which cells
exhibit aberrant promoter methylation in many genes.4−6 The mismatch repair gene MLH1 is known to be hypermethylated
in the late stages of CIMP-positive colorectal adenoma, leading to
the disruption of mismatch repair and thus development of colorectal
cancer with microsatellite instability (MSI) and a hypermutation phenotype.7−9

The small molecule 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) is
known
to be a hypomethylating agent.10,11 It destabilizes DNMT1,
leading to increased hypomethylated DNA. This destabilization is caused
by the incorporation of AZA into DNA instead of deoxycytidine, resulting
in covalent methyltransferase–AZA adducts.12 Although azacytosine–guanine dinucleotides are recognized
by DNMT1 as a natural substrate, the reaction is blocked by AZA, in
which carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen. AZA has been approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for inducing genome-wide hypomethylation
in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, a class of conditions
where certain blood cells are dysfunctional and of acute myeloid leukemia.13−15 In addition to AZA, DNA-binding molecules such as echinomycin have
also been reported to disrupt CpG methylation in vitro,16 though their clinical application has been limited
because of the cytotoxicity of these molecules. Moreover, none of
these molecules are able to demethylate CpGs in a site- or region-specific
manner because they do not selectively recognize the DNA sequences
surrounding the CpG dinucleotides. A technique for DNA hypomethylation
that selectively targets the aberrantly hypermethylated promoter CpG
islands of critical tumor suppressor genes, therefore, has not been
developed yet.

Pyrrole (Py)–imidazole (Im) polyamides
(PIPs) are a class
of small molecules that bind to the minor groove of DNA.17−21 Intramolecular stacking of the face-to-face heterocycles gives PIPs
a hairpin structure. An antiparallel pairing of Im opposite Py (Im/Py)
preferentially binds to a G/C base pair, whereas a Py/Py pair recognizes
A/T or T/A base pair.17,22,23 β-Alanine acts as an aliphatic substitute for a Py ring to
match the curvature of the minor groove surfaces at longer binding
sites.24,25 It has been shown that the energetic preferences
of these programmable molecules are comparable to those of natural
transcription factors and other DNA binding proteins.21,26−29

Dervan and colleagues have recently reported an eight-ring
hairpin
PIP targeting the sequence 5′-CGCG-3′ as a model for
CpG methylation inhibition in vitro.30 This
model suggested that PIP recognizing CpG sites could provide a molecular
basis for the design of sequence-selective antagonists of CpG methylation. MLH1 is one of the well-known genes that are often hypermethylated
in cancer.7−9 MLH1 protein works as a machinery of DNA-mismatch
repair; hence, its silencing via DNA hypermethylation causes genomic
instability resulting in tumor genesis.31,32 Therefore,
we designed a longer hairpin PIP comprising ten rings and two β-alanines
that recognizes 8 bp in the promoter of MLH1 to target
it selectively. In this study, we sought to determine whether this
PIP is able to prevent gene-silencing by inhibiting DNA methylation
in a site- or region-selective manner in living cells. We here demonstrate
the ability of the MLH1-selective PIP to inhibit
DNA methylation around the recognition site and to maintain the expression
of MLH1 in colorectal cancer cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Construction of PIPs and
Binding to MLH1 Promoter
Region
We designed two hairpin PIPs (Figure 1A), one that recognizes a sequence in the MLH1 promoter (MLH1_–16) and one that does not (MLH1_non).
The sequence 5′-AGCCGCTT-3′ in the promoter region of MLH1 is the target DNA sequence for MLH1_–16 including
the CpG site, which is the upstream 8-bp region nearest from the transcription
start site (TSS). MLH1_non contains the same ring number as MLH1_–16
and has the potential to recognize the sequence 5′-WGWCWGCW-3′
(W = A or T) that does not exist within ±1 kb of the MLH1 TSS (Figure 1B). To determine the binding affinities and specificities
of the two PIPs to the MLH1 target DNA sequence,
gel mobility shift assays were conducted. These clearly indicated
that MLH1_–16 bound to the appropriate 15-bp double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) sequence in the upstream region of MLH1. By contrast, MLH1_non did not bind to this DNA region (Figure 1C).

open circles represent Im and Py rings, respectively, diamonds represent
β-alanine, and curved lines represent γ-aminobutyric acid.

to target DNA in vitro by EMSA on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. Lane 1, double-stranded untreated DNA; lane 2, DNA treated with 5% DMSO (control); lanes 3–7,
DNA treated with various concentrations of MLH1_–16; and lanes 8–12, DNA treated with various concentrations
of MLH1_non. Mobility of 5′-FAM-labeled DNA corresponding to
the MLH1_–16 binding site (red letters) was
delayed in the presence of MLH1_–16 (5 or 10 μM), but
not in the presence of MLH1_non.

2.2 Inhibition of in Vitro DNA Methylation by
PIP
A plasmid containing 1.3 kb of DNA sequence from the
5′ region of MLH1 (−780 to +483) (Figure 2A) was subjected
to in vitro methylation by SssI methylase (M. SssI) in the presence or absence of PIPs. Methylation levels
at CpG sites at positions −70, −63, −27, −16,
−1, +157, and +172 were quantitatively estimated using pyrosequencing
(Figure 2B). This confirmed
that all CpGs analyzed were fully methylated in the absence of PIPs.
In the presence of 5 μM or more MLH1_–16, however, the
methylation levels were significantly reduced at the targeted position
(−16) and at nearby positions −27 and −1. Methylation
at positions further upstream and downstream was not inhibited. By
contrast, MLH1_non did not inhibit in vitro methylation at any position,
even at a concentration of 40 μM. This demonstrates that selective
binding of MLH1_–16 to a specific DNA sequence causes selective
inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro. The half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of MLH1_–16 was estimated as 3.2 μM.

DNA methylation was inhibited at positions −27, −16,
and −1 in the presence of MLH1_–16.

2.3 Localization of PIP in the Nucleus
The next question was whether MLH1_–16 can inhibit MLH1 methylation in cellulo, thereby inhibiting MLH1 silencing. To first confirm that the PIPs were incorporated
into cells and localized to the nucleus, rectal carcinoma (RKO) cells
were incubated with FAM-labeled MLH1_–16 (Figure 3A) and then fixed with formaldehyde.
Strong green fluorescent signals were detected in the nuclei of these
cells (Figure 3B).
Nuclear localization of MLH1_non had already been confirmed in a previous
study,26 and its uptake into RKO cells
was also demonstrated (Figure S1). Thus,
we confirmed that both PIPs can be easily incorporated into RKO cells
and rapidly localized to the nuclei. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
analysis was conducted to evaluate the binding affinity of MLH1_–16
to the target DNA 5′-AGCCGCTT-3′ sequence (Figure S2). Dissociation equilibrium constant
(KD = kd/ka, in which kd and ka are the dissociation and association rate
constants, respectively) was estimated to be 2.7 × 10–8 M [kd = 1.06 × 10–3 (1/s) and ka = 3.96 × 104 (1/M·s)] using SPR analysis.

1 day of incubation. (A) Chemical structure of the FAM-labeled MLH1_–16.
(B) Cells were visualized using fluorescence microscopy following
nuclear staining with DAPI (blue or red). MLH1_–16 was localized in the nuclei of RKO cells after
1 day. MLH1_non was also confirmed to be localized in the nuclei (Figure S1).

2.4 Inhibition of DNA Methylation in Living Cells
by PIP
Before PIPs were given to living cells, optimization
of the PIP concentration was performed using WST-8 assay. MLH1_–16
and MLH1_non were found to have no cytotoxic effects at concentrations
of up to 10 μM for 72 h (Figure S3). However, crystallization of MLH1_–16 and MLH1_non was observed
at 10 μM. We therefore chose a concentration of 5.0 μM
for the 30-day treatment in this study.

Because it is known
that CpG sites of the MLH1 promoter in RKO cells
are highly methylated,33 we examined whether
the MLH1_–16 treatment could reduce the methylation levels
in a site-specific manner. RKO cells were first treated with MLH1_–16
or MLH1_non at a concentration of 5.0 μM for 30 days, and the MLH1 methylation levels on −27, −16, and −1
CpG sites were analyzed. There was no significant reduction of DNA
methylation by simple treatment of MLH1_–16 (Figure 4), hence, we applied AZA–hypoxia
treatment on RKO cells, which was reported previously,33 to induce DNA methylation in the MLH1 promoter region.

Figure 4 DNA methylation levels of MLH1 in RKO
cells treated
with MLH1_–16 or MLH1_non for 30 days. RKO cells were treated
with 0.1% DMSO (control), 5 μΜ MLH1_–16, or 5 μΜ
MLH1_non under normal conditions (20% O2). Data represent
the mean of three independent replicates ±SD. No significant
reduction of DNA methylation at positions −27, −16,
and −1 was observed compared with untreated control (day 0).

2.5 DNA Methylation
at the MLH1 Promoter Region
under Hypoxia
To assess the effect of the PIPs on DNA methylation
in living cells, we first sought to confirm that methylation could
be induced in RKO cells by hypoxia after demethylation with AZA treatment,
as previously reported.33 First, RKO cells
underwent AZA treatment to demethylate the MLH1 promoter
region (Figure 5).
Without AZA treatment, the methylation levels at positions −27,
−16, and −1 in the MLH1 promoter region
of RKO cells were 91.1, 93.4, and 92.2% (Figure 5A), respectively, whereas those in RKO cells
treated with AZA were reduced to 44.1, 42.1, and 41.8% [P = 0.0004 vs dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control], respectively. When
RKO cells were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin
A; TSA) in combination with AZA to synergistically enhance gene activation
by acetylating histones and demethylating DNA,34,35 the methylation levels were also reduced to similar levels: 43.5,
48.0, and 47.9% (P = 0.0002 vs DMSO control), respectively.
The MLH1 expression was completely silenced in untreated
RKO cells (Figure 5B), but this silencing was somewhat or markedly inhibited by treatment
with AZA or AZA + TSA, respectively.

Figure 5 Decreased DNA methylation and increased MLH1 mRNA
expression induced by AZA or AZA + TSA treatment of RKO cells. (A)
DNA methylation levels in the MLH1 promoter of RKO
cells treated with DMSO (control), AZA, or AZA + TSA. Data represent
the mean of three independent replicates ±SD. The methylation
level in the MLH1 promoter was decreased by AZA or
AZA + TSA treatment. (B) RT-PCR analysis of the MLH1 expression in RKO cells treated with DMSO (control), AZA, or AZA
+ TSA. GAPDH was used as an internal control. MLH1 was re-expressed somewhat or markedly by treatment
with AZA or AZA + TSA, respectively.

Next, RKO cells treated with AZA for 8 days were subsequently
cultured
under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) to inactivate MLH1, as previously reported.33 As shown in Figure 6A, the DNA methylation levels at positions −27, −16,
and −1 had significantly increased to 75.8, 71.8, and 72.3%,
respectively, by day 20 (H20; P = 0.002 vs H0) and
had increased to 88.5, 91.8, and 90.4%, respectively, by H30 (P = 5 × 10–6 vs H0). Consequently,
the MLH1 expression was completely silenced at H20
and H30 (Figure 6B).
Similarly, RKO cells treated with both AZA and TSA for 8 days were
cultured under hypoxic conditions (Figure 6A). The DNA methylation levels at positions
−27, −16, and −1 increased significantly to 72.6,
74.1, and 73.5%, respectively, at H20 (P = 0.0003
vs H0) and to 89.0, 94.3, and 87.2%, respectively, at H30 (P = 0.0004 vs H0). MLH1 was markedly expressed
at H0, somewhat repressed at H20, and completely silenced at H30 (Figure 6B). We therefore
determined that treatment with AZA + TSA should be a better condition
for subsequent analyses.

Figure 6 Increased DNA methylation and decreased MLH1 mRNA
expression in RKO cells incubated under hypoxia. (A) DNA methylation
levels in the MLH1 promoter of RKO cells treated
with AZA or AZA + TSA and then incubated under hypoxic conditions
(1% O2) for 0, 20, or 30 days (H0, H20, H30, respectively).
Data represent the mean of three independent replicates ±SD.
The methylation level of the MLH1 promoter was increased
under hypoxic conditions. (B) RT-PCR analysis of the MLH1 expression in RKO cells treated with AZA or AZA + TSA and incubated
under hypoxic conditions for 0, 20, or 30 days. GAPDH was used as an internal control. MLH expression
was silenced under hypoxic conditions.

2.6 Inhibition of DNA Methylation in Living Cells
by PIP in Hypoxia after AZA + TSA Treatment
RKO cells underwent
pretreatment with AZA + TSA, producing similar results to those obtained
in the DNA methylation analysis above (Figure 7A). Under hypoxic conditions with no PIP
treatment, the DNA methylation levels at positions −27, −16,
and −1 were 71.6, 72.3, and 70.4%, respectively, at H20 and
89.4, 95.1, and 86.0%, respectively, at H30. When treated with hypoxia
and 5.0 μM MLH1_–16, however, the DNA methylation levels
at −27, −16, and −1 were significantly reduced
to 58.5, 55.4, and 56.9%, respectively, at H20 (P = 0.0005 vs DMSO control) and 64.0, 68.6, and 70.5%, respectively,
at H30 (P = 0.003 vs DMSO control). In the presence
of 5.0 μM MLH1_non, however, DNA methylation at −27,
−16, and −1 was not inhibited, leading to methylation
levels of 78.4, 72.3, and 74.4%, respectively, at H20 (P = 0.2 vs DMSO control) and 92.2, 96.0, and 93.1%, respectively,
at H30 (P = 0.3 vs DMSO control).

of DNA methylation and MLH1 silencing by MLH1_–16
in RKO cells incubated under hypoxia.
(A) DNA methylation levels in the MLH1 promoter of
RKO cells treated with AZA + TSA and then incubated under hypoxic
conditions (1% O2) with DMSO (control), 5 μΜ
MLH1_–16, or 5 μΜ MLH1_non. Data represent the
mean of three independent replicates ±SD. **P < 0.01, N.S. not significant (P > 0.05).
Increase
of DNA methylation at positions −70, −63, −27,
−16, −1, +156, and +171 was inhibited in the presence
of MLH1_–16, but not in the presence of MLH1_non. (B) RT-PCR
analysis of the MLH1 expression in RKO cells treated
with AZA + TSA and then incubated under hypoxia with DMSO (control),
MLH1_–16, or MLH1_non. GAPDH was used as an
internal control. Silencing of MLH1 was inhibited
in the presence of MLH1_–16.

DNA methylation levels at CpG sites further upstream and
downstream
from the MLH1_–16 binding sites (−70, −63, +157,
and +172 from TSS) were also analyzed. Similar to DNA methylation
levels at positions −27, −16, and −1, methylation
was elevated at all sites under hypoxic conditions in a time-dependent
manner. In DMSO-treated (control) cells, the DNA methylation levels
at −70, −63, +157, and +172 increased to 68.4, 70.6,
72.0, and 80.2%, respectively, at H20 and 79.3, 81.5, 89.7, and 86.5%,
respectively, at H30. In MLH1_–16-treated cells, the methylation
levels were somewhat reduced to 63.4, 60.4, 66.0, and 68.3%, respectively,
at H20 (P = 0.04 vs DMSO control) and 77.1, 75.8,
76.4, and 77.9%, respectively, at H30 (P = 0.047
vs DMSO control). Inhibition of methylation was not observed, however,
in MLH1_non-treated cells, with levels of 69.2, 70.7, 79.2, and 73.7%,
respectively, at H20 (P = 0.8 vs DMSO control) and
84.2, 86.6, 92.9, and 89.0%, respectively, at H30 (P = 0.2 vs DMSO control). Thus, DNA methylation at these CpG sites
was slightly, but significantly, inhibited in the presence of MLH1_–16.
Overall, the methylation levels of these seven CpG sites in MLH1_–16-treated
cells were significantly inhibited compared with those of DMSO (P = 0.0002 at H20 and 0.0002 at H30) or those of MLH1_non
(P = 0.00006 at H20 and 0.000007 at H30), whereas
there was no significant change between those of DMSO and MLH1_non
(P = 0.2 at H20 and 0.08 at H30).

MLH1 was markedly expressed following AZA + TSA
treatment and was silenced when treated with DMSO (control) or MLH1_non.
In the presence of 5.0 μM MLH1_–16, however, MLH1 was expressed, even at H30 (Figure 7B).

Additionally, DNA methylation at
more distant CpG sites (−589
and −579 from TSS) was assessed. There was no significant difference
in the DNA methylation levels among the control, MLH1_–16-treated,
and MLH1_non-treated cells (Figure S4).
Similar to RKO cells pretreated with AZA + TSA, as above, the methylation
levels at −27, −16, and −1 in RKO cells pretreated
with AZA alone and then treated with MLH1_–16 were also significantly
reduced compared with those in controls at both H20 and H30 (Figure S5A). However, the MLH1 expression was completely silenced at H20 and H30 in all AZA-pretreated
RKO cells (DMSO control, MLH1_–16, and MLH1_non; Figure S5B) presumably because of the low basal
expression level of MLH1 at H0 in AZA-pretreated
RKO cells.

2.7 PIP-Mediated Targeted Inhibition
of DNA Methylation
The above experiments demonstrate that
PIPs can induce region-selective
inhibition of DNA methylation in living cells. MLH1_–16, which
was designed to bind to the CpG site nearest to the TSS of the MLH1 gene, selectively inhibited DNA remethylation of the
target CpG site and the surrounding region in RKO cells. This selective
inhibition resulted in inhibition of re-silencing of the MLH1 gene expression.

PIPs are molecules that selectively recognize
DNA sequences.20,21 The binding affinities of these
polyamides have been shown to be as strong as those of transcription
factors.29 Thus, PIPs can inhibit the function
of DNA-binding factors, including transcription factors and DNA modification
factors, via competitive binding to their recognition sites.26−29 In a previous study, Dervan et al.30 reported
that PIPs recognizing 4–5-bp of CG-rich DNA sequences could
inhibit the action of DNMT on plasmids with semiartificial sequences
and λ-phage DNA in vitro. In this study, we demonstrated that
a longer PIP recognizing 8-bp (MLH1_–16) can also inhibit DNMT
selectively in vitro and in cellulo. Moreover, the CpG site where
DNA methylation was inhibited by MLH1_–16 is an endogenous
sequence of the MLH1 promoter, and the MLH1_–16-mediated
selective inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in the inhibition
of MLH1 gene silencing in RKO cells. As shown in Figure 4, a simple treatment
of MLH1_–16 could not reduce the DNA methylation levels, suggesting
that maintenance DNA methylation by DNMT1 could not be inhibited by
PIPs in living cells. By contrast, MLH1_–16 inhibited de novo
DNA methylation after treatment of AZA (+TSA) followed by culturing
under hypoxic conditions (Figure 7), suggesting that de novo DNA methylation by DNMT3
could be inhibited by PIPs in living cells. It is well known that
DNMT1 rapidly maintains CpG methylation on daughter chains immediately
after DNA replication.36,37 Further studies would be required
to clarify the details, such as whether MLH1_–16 could not
bind to dsDNA before DNMT1 completes maintenance methylation and thus
could not reduce the DNA methylation levels in cellulo. Although the
concentrations of MLH1_–16 and MLH1_non were limited up to
5 μM because of their solubility, a higher concentration could
show better effects. Therefore, we are going to modify the MLH1_–16
structure including changing the recognition size and water solubility.

2.8 Implications for Colorectal Cancer and Other
Conditions
The MLH1 gene is a human homolog
of the Escherichia coli DNA mismatch
repair gene mutL, and mutation of MLH1 and of other mismatch repair genes (e.g., MSH3 and MSH6) is known to cause hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer
(HNPCC).8,9,31,32MLH1 mediates protein–protein
interactions during mismatch recognition, strand discrimination, and
strand removal. Defects in MLH1 are thus associated
with MSI observed in HNPCC.31,32 In sporadic colorectal
cancer, promoter hypermethylation, rather than mutation, causes inactivation
of the MLH1 gene.31,32 A subgroup
of sporadic colorectal cancers is known to exhibit CIMP, a phenotype
characterized by significant hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands.4,5 CIMP(+) colorectal cancer is known to develop through the serrated
pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis. Sessile serrated adenoma is
characterized by CIMP,38 mutation of BRAF,39,40 and preferential occurrence in
the right-side colon, but loss of MLH1 protein expression is rarely
observed in the early adenoma stage.9 The MLH1 promoter is hypermethylated in the late stages of the
serrated pathway, leading to loss of MLH1 and thus MSI and hypermutation
of genes, causing colorectal cancer.9MLH1 methylation is thus a critical step in the progression
of this type of colorectal cancer, and we therefore chose to use the MLH1 promoter region to determine the success of PIP-mediated
targeted inhibition of DNA methylation in this study.

It has
been reported that methylation of the MLH1 promoter
is accelerated in RKO cells by hypoxic stress via a pathway dependent
on the histone demethylase LSD1.33 In that
report, knockdown of LSD1 or its corepressor CoREST prevented the
resilencing of the endogenous MLH1 promoter in RKO
cells following transient reactivation by AZA. We therefore investigated
whether MLH1_–16 also prevented the resilencing of MLH1 under the same hypoxic conditions and showed that MLH1_–16
inhibits the silencing of MLH1 through inhibition
of DNA methylation in a region-specific manner. In addition to this
hypoxia model, there are other methylation induction models in the
literature, such as the one involving Epstein–Barr viral infection
of gastric epithelial cells6,41 and the one involving
TET inactivation caused by IDH2 mutation in neural
progenitor cells.42 Chronic infection of
the gastric epithelium by Helicobacter also induces hypermethylation of a subset of genes.41,43−45 Although methylation of the MLH1 promoter is not necessarily induced in these models, future studies
may involve designing other PIPs to recognize additional hypermethylation
target genes, such as p16,41,46 another critical tumor-suppressor gene. Recently, it has been reported
that fusion proteins composed of DNA-binding domains and DNA-methylation
editing machineries represent potentially useful toolkits for performing
targeted editing of epigenomic modifications.47−49 However, these
protein-based methods require genomic introduction such as a virus
infection. On the other hand, PIPs are small molecules that are cell-permeable
and intravenously injectable to treat target tissues/cells.28,50 Investigations into the effects of targeted methylation inhibition
in these models should be highly informative and may eventually prove
clinically useful.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Cell Culture and DNA/RNA Extraction
The colorectal
cancer cell line RKO was purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). RKO cells were
maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 μg/mL streptomycin and were grown in a humidified incubator
at 37 °C. Genomic DNA and total RNA from RKO cells were extracted
using QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and RNAeasy Mini
Kit (QIAGEN), respectively.

3.2 Design of PIP-Targeting
TSS Region of Human
MLH1
MLH1_–16 was designed with the sequence Ac-Py-Im-β-Im-Im-Py-γ-Im-Py-β-Im-Py-Py-β-Dp,
where β represents β-alanine, γ represents γ-aminobutyric
acid, and Dp indicates dimethylaminopropylamide. MLH1_–16 was
designed to recognize the CpG site upstream of the TSS of the human MLH1 gene (positions −19 to −12, when the
TSS is regarded as +1). MLH1_non (Ac-Im-Py-β-Im-Py-Py-γ-Im-Py-Py-β-Im-Py-β-Dp)26 has no binding site in the MLH1 promoter region (Figure 1). These PIPs were purchased from Hipep Laboratories (Kyoto,
Japan) and stocked by dissolving the compound in DMSO at 20 mM. The
working solution was serially diluted to obtain the desired concentration.

3.3 Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
The 15-bp dsDNA region containing the 5′ segment of MLH1 (−22 to −8), with a composition of 5′-FAM-AGTAGCCGCTTCAGG-3′
annealed with 5′-CCTGAAGCGGCTACT-3′, was used for the
EMSA. In a 0.2 mL tube, 1.0 μM FAM-labeled dsDNA was incubated
with serially diluted concentrations of MLH1_–16 or MLH1_non
in a 10 μL reaction solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
and 10% DMSO for 1 h at 37 °C on a T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The resultant complexes were loaded
onto a 20% polyacrylamide gel and separated using EMSA in 0.5×
TBE. Selective binding between each PIP and the dsDNA was visualized
using an LAS-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

3.4 SPR Assay
All SPR experiments were
performed on a ProteON XPR36 system (Bio-Rad) at 25 °C, as described
previously.28 Biotinylated hairpin 72-mer
nucleotides (5′-biotin-TAGCGGGCAG TAGCCGCTTC AGGGAGGGAC GAAGTTTTCT
TCGTCCCTCC CTGAAGCGGC TACTGCCCGC TA-3′) including MLH1_–16
targeting sequence were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated SA sensor
chip at a flow rate of 20 μL/m to obtain the required immobilization
level [up to approximately 1000 resonance units (RU)]. The samples
were dissolved in HBS-EP buffer [10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA),
and 0.005% surfactant P20] with 0.1% DMSO at 25 °C, pH 7.4 for
the experiment.

3.5 Distribution of FITC-Labeled
MLH1_–16
in Cultured RKO Cells
RKO cells were seeded at a density
of 1.0 × 105 cells per 35 mm dish and grown in 2 mL
of a medium. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with 1.0 μM
FAM-labeled MLH1_–16 (FAM-β-Py-Im-β-Im-Im-Py-γ-Im-Py-β-Im-Py-Py-β-Dp)
for 24 h and then fixed with 10% HCHO for 2 h on ice. The fixed cells
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by
nuclear staining with 1.0 μg/mL of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). The cells were visualized using a BZ-X710 fluorescence microscope
(Keyence, Osaka, Japan).

3.6 Plasmid Construction
DNA fragments
from the 5′ region of MLH1 (−780 to
+483) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the
genomic DNA of RKO cells. Primer sequences are listed in Table S1. PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T
Easy vectors (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. E. coli XLI-Blue competent
cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were transformed
and cultured on Luria–Bertani (LB) plates with 100 μg/mL
ampicillin, 32 μg/mL X-gal, and 400 μg/mL isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 37 °C. Appropriate
colonies were selected by colony-direct PCR using the primers gMLH1_–780F
and SP6_R (Table S1) and were transferred
to 100 mL LB medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and cultured overnight
at 37 °C. Plasmids with appropriate inserts were extracted using
a NucleoBond Xtra Midi column (Macherey Nagel, Bethlehem, PA, USA),
and then the concentration of the plasmid was determined using a NanoDrop
2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

3.7 In Vitro Inhibition of CpG Methylation
In a 0.2 mL tube, 1.0 μg unmethylated plasmid DNA including MLH1 (−780 to +483) was incubated with serially diluted
concentrations of MLH1_–16 or 40 μM MLH1_non in 10 μL
of 1× NEB Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for
12 h at 25 °C. A control sample of unmethylated plasmid DNA in
buffer with DMSO only was also incubated for 12 h at 25 °C. After
incubation, S-adenosyl methionine (New England Biolabs)
and CpG methyltransferase M SssI (New England Biolabs)
were added to the samples to a final concentration of 320 μM
and 0.2 U/μL, respectively, resulting in 20 μL of total
solution (final concentration of the 4.2-kbp plasmid DNA, 18 nM),
to which was added 5% DMSO. A negative control contained distilled
water instead of CpG methyltransferase. The samples were then incubated
for 2 h at 37 °C on a T100 thermal cycler followed by heat-inactivation
for 20 min at 65 °C. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated in a centrifuge
at 4 °C for 10 min with the addition of 2 μL of 3 M NaOAc
(pH 5.2) and 50 μL of ethanol at −20 °C. The DNA
was washed twice with ice-cold 70% ethanol and allowed to air-dry
for 30 min. The DNA was dissolved in 100 μL of 10 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8.0) and used for PCR amplification followed by pyrosequencing,
as described below.

3.8 AZA/TSA Treatment
RKO cells were
seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per 6 cm dish
and incubated for 24 h. Next, the cells were exposed to AZA by replacing
the medium with a fresh medium containing 5.0 μM AZA every 24
h. The cells were also exposed to TSA for 24 h by replacing the medium
containing AZA with a medium containing 100 nM TSA on day 7. The cells
were harvested on day 8 or were collected and subjected to hypoxic
conditions, as described below.

3.9 Growth-Inhibiting
Effects of PIPs in RKO Cells
RKO cells were plated at 2000
cells/well on 96-well plates with
50 μL of a culture medium. One day later, the medium was changed
to 100 μL of fresh medium containing 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 μM
of the compounds. In all experiments, the final DMSO concentration
was the same (0.1%). After treatment with the compounds for 72 h,
10 μL of the WST-8 reagent (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was added
into each well followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. Absorbance
was then measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax PLUS 384 microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

3.10 Treatment with PIP under Hypoxic Conditions
To culture
cells under severe hypoxia at 1% O2, the
cells were maintained under a continuous flow of a humidified mixture
of 94% N2, 5% CO2, and 1% O2 in an
incubator with an O2 sensor and a MCO-18M regulator (Sanyo,
Osaka, Japan). The CO2 level was maintained at 5% using
an internal CO2-regulation system. RKO cells treated with
AZA/TSA for 8 days (H0) were subsequently treated with 5.0 μM
MLH1_–16 or MLH1_non containing 0.1% DMSO for 30 days. The
medium containing PIP was refreshed every 5 days, and the cells were
passaged at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 6 cm dish
when the cells became nearly confluent. The cells were harvested on
day 0 (H0, without hypoxia treatment), day 20 (H20), and day 30 (H30).

3.11 Bisulfite Conversion and Methylation Analysis
Using Pyrosequencing
Bisulfite conversion of DNA was performed
using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA),
and the resultant product was suspended in 40 μL of distilled
water. The methylation status of the PCR product was quantitatively
determined using pyrosequencing, as previously described.6,9 Briefly, the biotinylated PCR product was bound to Streptavidin
Sepharose High Performance beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little
Chalfont, UK), washed, and denatured using a 0.2 M NaOH solution.
After the addition of 300 nM sequencing primer to the purified single-stranded
PCR product, pyrosequencing was carried out on a PyroMark Q24 MD System
(Qiagen) with the Pyro Q-CpG software (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Primer sequences and conditions, as well as the number
of analyzed CpG sites, are shown in Table S2. Methylation control samples (0 and 100% methylated)51,52 were used for confirmation in every assay.

3.12 Analysis
of mRNA Expression Levels by Reverse
Transcription (RT)-PCR
First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried
out using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase and oligo dT primers
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RT-PCR analyses of MLH1 and GAPDH genes were performed in RKO cells treated with AZA
and TSA followed by subsequent treatment by PIP under 1% O2 conditions. PCR was performed using FastTaq polymerase (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). PCR primers and conditions are shown in Table S1. Each PCR product (5 μL) was then
separated on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and
visualized using a Gel Doc EZ Imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

3.13 Statistical Analysis
The differences
in the methylation levels were analyzed using the Student’s t test. Unless otherwise specified, P values
of <0.05 were considered to denote statistical significance. All
statistical analyses were performed using R software (www.r-project.org/).
