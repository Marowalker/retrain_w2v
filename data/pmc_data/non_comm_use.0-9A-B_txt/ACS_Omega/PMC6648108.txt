The
study on the removal of refractory veterinary antibiotic florfenicol
(FF) in water is still very limited. In this study, an efficient Fenton-like
catalyst was developed by synthesizing a series of Cu-based multi-metal
layered double hydroxides (CuNiFeLa-LDHs) to degrade FF in aqueous
solution. In the experiments, the screened CuNiFeLa-2-LDH with the
molar ratio of La3+/(Fe3+ + La3+)
= 0.1 exhibited high catalytic activity, achieving almost complete
degradation of 5 mg L–1 FF under 5 mmol L–1 H2O2 conditions. The mechanisms revealed that
the enhanced catalytic performance was ascribed to the existence of
Ni which accelerated the electron transfer rate and La which served
as a Lewis acidic site to provide more reactive sites in this Cu-dominated
Fenton-like reaction, further generating •OH, •O2–, and O21 as active species to attack pollutants directly. Interestingly,
the catalyst showed a wide pH adaptability and little release of copper
ions to the solution. The regenerated CuNiFeLa-2-LDH is demonstrated
to be a stable and reliable material for florfenicol degradation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Veterinary
antibiotics (VAs), as a category of pharmaceuticals,
are used widely for the disease precaution of animals in many countries.1 It was estimated that the average usage of VAs
in China has reached about 6000 metric tons per year with continuous
growth.2 The discharged antibiotics may
enter the soil through land application of manures in the farmland
and further release into the aquatic environment by runoff, driftage,
or leaching.3,4 In recent years, researchers have
evidenced that the presence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance
genes in wastewater have a great possibility to disturb the natural
ecological balance and result in an increase of resistant bacteria
in the natural environment, posing a serious threat to ecosystems
and human health.5,6 Among these VAs, florfenicol (FF)
is a synthetically produced broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and
is especially developed for veterinary application.7 As one of the few allowed VAs in aquaculture, FF can exist
for a long time in the environment and traditional water treatment
technologies cannot effectively degrade or remove it.8 Numerous approaches have been employed to solve the pollution
of antibiotics, such as photocatalysis, adsorption and biodegradation.9−11 However, studies on the degradation of refractory VAs, especially
FF, are still limited.

The Fenton reaction, as one of the most
efficient advanced oxidation
processes, has attracted more attention for the removal of antibiotics
from water in recent years.12,13 Generally, the generation
of active species (•OH, •O2–, etc.) between Fe2+ and H2O2 can oxidize and mineralize pollutants into harmless
substances such as CO2 and H2O.14 However, the application of the classical homogeneous Fenton
reaction is limited due to the requirement of low pH (<4), the
difficulty of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycling, and the production
of ferric hydroxide sludge in aqueous solution.15,16 To avoid the above disadvantages, the heterogeneous Fenton-like
reaction was developed to degrade organic pollutants efficiently in
a possible wide pH range. Among these improved methods, it has been
observed that copper has the same Fenton reaction effect as iron.
As expected, Cu+ can be oxidized by H2O2 to produce •OH. The oxidized state of Cu2+ can react with H2O2 to generate HO2• (eqs 1 and 2). The circulation rate of Cu+/Cu2+ is much faster than Fe2+/Fe3+ (eqs 3 and 4), loosening the limited rate step.16,17 Moreover, copper has good pH adaptability, which is proved to be
a significant advantage for the replacement of iron in the Fenton
reaction. 1   2   3   4  To avoid the
mobilization of Cu+/Cu2+ in aqueous solution,
numerous methods have been
suggested to load copper onto the solid substrate to remove different
organic pollutants, such as Cu-based bimetallic oxides, Cu-doped goethite,
and the zero-valent iron/Cu bimetallic catalyst.18−20 Layered double
hydroxides (LDHs), with the general formula [M1–x2+M3+x(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n·mH2O, where M2+ and M3+ represent divalent
and trivalent metal cations, respectively, has certified a category
of catalyst and adsorbent to purify the polluted water. Due to the
excellent properties, such as anionic exchangeability, topotactic
transformation, the high specific surface area, and the typical lamellar
structure, LDH materials have attracted attention from researchers
in recent years.21−23 Previous studies including our research group have
investigated the Fenton effect of Cu-LDHs, illustrating the possibility
of Cu-LDH used in catalytic oxidation to degrade organic pollutants
in water.24−26 However, few studies have reported about the effects
of cation compositions in LDHs on the Fenton-like reaction.

The objective of this study was to develop a novel Cu-based multi-metal
material CuNiFeLa-LDH used as the Fenton-like catalyst with a wide
pH adaptability and low release of heavy metal ions to purify the
polluted water containing the refractory VAs, FF. To compare the performances
of CuNiFeLa-LDH with other related LDH materials and explore the contribution
of different compositions, several LDHs including CuFe-LDH, NiFe-LDH,
CuNiFe-LDH, and CuMgFeLa-LDH were prepared. The influence of different
factors such as La doping contents, H2O2 concentration,
catalyst dosage, and FF concentrations were investigated. Several
antibiotics such as ibuprofen (IBF), diclofenac sodium (DCF), and
paracetamol (PR) were also used as pollutants to evaluate the applicability
of the material. In addition, the reusability and stability of the
material was evaluated by regenerating the catalyst of each cycle.
The possible promotion mechanism of La and Ni in CuNiFeLa-LDH on degradation
of FF by the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction was proposed and discussed
by a series of experiments before and after the reaction.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
2.1.1 Chemical Composition of Synthesized Materials
The material,
CuNiFeLa-LDH, with a fixed content of La doping was
dissolved in a certain concentration of concentrated nitric acid and
the content of metal ions was measured by inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The chemical compositions
of the materials are presented in Table S1. It is clearly found that the results of CuNiFeLa-LDHs were consistent
with the molar ratio of the initial synthesis. Considering the general
formula, the chemical compositions of the materials were calculated.

2.1.2 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
The
XRD patterns of the synthesized CuNiFeLa-LDHs with different
La doping contents are shown in Figure 1a. It is obviously observed that CuNiFeLa-LDH materials
maintained a good crystal structure with lower La doping contents.
The crystallographic planes of (003), (006), (012), (015), (110),
and (113) represented the typical diffraction peaks of LDHs.27−29 However, the intensity of the diffraction peaks decline, indicating
that the layered hydrotalcite-like structure was destroyed with the
addition of more La proportion. The changes were attributed to excessive
introduction of numerous large ionic radius of La3+ species,
which can attract more carbonate ions into the lattice and result
in poor crystallinity of the materials.30 In addition, two diffraction peaks for La2O3 in the range of 25–30° appear in CuNiFeLa-3-LDH and
CuNiFeLa-4-LDH instead of CuNiFeLa-1-LDH and CuNiFeLa-2-LDH, which
proved that a small amount of La doping did not affect the LDH crystallization.31 For comparative analysis, the XRD patterns of
several different metal cation compositions in LDHs are given in Figure 1b. It can be found
that NiFe-LDH, CuNiFe-LDH, and CuMgFeLa-LDH exhibit similar diffraction
peaks, whereas the layered structure disappears in CuFe-LDH when Cu2+ and Fe3+ entered into the laminate. This could
be explained by Jahn–Teller distortion, which can increase
the disorder of the crystallization of the laminate.32

NiFe-LDH, CuNiFe-LDH, and CuMgFeLa-LDH, respectively. Fourier transform

CuMgFeLa-LDH, (d) different La-doped CuNiFeLa-LDHs, respectively.

2.1.3 FTIR
Analysis
The surface functional
groups of the materials were characterized by FTIR spectra. Figure 1c depicts the FTIR
spectrum of the as-prepared CuNiFeLa-LDHs with different La doping
contents. These spectra are consistent with the typical FTIR patterns
of LDHs.33 Moreover, the introduction of
the rare earth element La to the lattice can slightly change the peak
shift. Among these spectra, the strong and broad adsorption peak near
3418 cm–1 of all samples can be assigned to the
O–H stretching vibrations from hydroxyl groups and interlayer
water molecules. The bending vibration band of water molecules appear
around 1643 cm–1. In addition, the intensity of
the adsorption peak at 1380 cm–1 (ν3(CO32–)) and 1477 cm–1 (ν3(CO32–)ads) is strengthened with the enlargement of lanthanum doping for the
attraction of carbon dioxide, resulting in an increase of carbonate
anions in the interlayer to maintain charge balance.34,35 The increased carbonate anions can result in the enlargement of
the interlayer spacing, making it easier for contaminants to contact
with the material for the degradation process. The peaks in the low
frequency area of wavenumber from 400 to 800 cm–1 corresponded to the lattice vibration such as metal–oxygen–metal
(M–O–M) stretching and metal-hydroxyl vibrations. For
comparison, the FTIR patterns of other LDHs are given in Figure 1d. The O–H
stretching vibrations, H2O bending vibrations, stretching
of CO32–, and M–O–M vibration
of all samples can be found, which resembled those of other LDHs.36,37

2.1.4 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
and ζ-Potential Analysis
The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution of CuNiFe-LDH and CuNiFeLa-2-LDH
are shown in Figure S1. The specific surface
area was calculated from the adsorption data by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, whereas the total pore volume and pore size distribution
was analyzed from the desorption branch by the Brunauer–Joyner–Halenda
method. It is observed that both CuNiFe-LDH and CuNiFeLa-2-LDH displayed
type IV isotherms with a H3 type hysteresis loop according to the
IUPAC classification. In addition, CuNiFe-LDH has the pore size distribution
between 2 and 15 nm, whereas CuNiFeLa-2-LDH shows the uniform distribution
due to the existence of mesopores, which demonstrated that the doping
of La can fabricate more mesopores in the material, making the entrance
of FF into the sample for degradation more easy. The specific surface
area of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH (162.823 m2 g–1) is much higher than that of CuNiFe-LDH (82.899 m2 g–1), which is essential for FF degradation to provide
more active sites. The ζ-potential of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH is 8.61,
measured in the pH range from 6 to 10 as shown in Figure S2.

2.1.5 Surface Morphology Analysis
An
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH is presented
in Figure 2a. As can
be seen from the image, the sample shows a plate-like morphology and
the materials are aggregated. The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH exhibits a layered structure in Figure 2b. The area with
saturated color manifested that the thick plate-like structure was
aggregated, which can be ascribed to the introduction of La3+ for the effect of the crystallinity of LDHs and the aggregation
of the lattice. In addition, the elemental mapping analysis (Figure 2c) of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH
confirmed that the elements Cu, Ni, Fe, and La were highly dispersed
within the laminate, and the appearance of C and O indicated that
this LDH intercalated with carbonate anions. Besides, the energy dispersive
spectrum (EDS) of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH is given in Figure 3a. The peaks of this material further certified
the presence of the metal elements which insert into the lattice.
The molar ratio between the metal elements is consistent with that
measured by ICP-OES (Table S2).

spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH before and after the
reaction.

2.1.6 XPS
Analysis
The full XPS spectrum
of the sample is presented in Figure 3b. In the typical XPS survey, all elements in this
LDH material were detected. The peaks of C 1s and O 1s are shown in Figure S3. The high-resolution of the Cu 2p3/2 transition of the sample are shown in Figure 4a. The “shake-up”
peak of the Cu2+ satellite is obviously observed at the
binding energy of 941.9 eV. The peak at 934.7 eV corresponded to the
oxidation of copper species (Cu2+), whereas the peak located
at 933.2 eV exhibited the reduction copper species (Cu+) according to previous reports,38,39 and the ratio
of Cu2+/Cu+ equals to 2.58:1. These results
signified that both Cu+ and Cu2+ existed on
the surface of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH and the efficiency of the Fenton-like
reaction might be regulated by the cycle of Cu+/Cu2+. In Ni 2p3/2 spectra, their characteristic peaks
are discovered as presented in Figure 4b. The appearance of a shake-up satellite line at 861.55
eV was attributed to Ni2+ on the surface of the catalyst.
Besides, the peak at 856.6 eV confirmed the oxidation of nickel species
belonging to Ni3+ and that near 855.25 eV corresponded
to the reduction state of nickel species (Ni2+).40 The XPS curve fittings of nickel species manifested
the existence of Ni2+ and Ni3+ with the atomic
ratio of 2.28:1, indicating that the electron transfer process may
occur. In addition, the peaks of Fe 2p and La 3d were also measured
as shown in Figure 4c,d, which illustrated the existence of Fe3+ and La2O3.41,42

Figure 4 High-resolution XPS spectrum of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH

2p, (c) Fe 2p, and (d) La 3d before the reaction.

Combining the above facts, the electron transfer between
copper
and nickel is surmised in this Fenton-reaction system. The existence
of Ni2+ with the valence electronic configuration 3d64s2 is regarded as the electron donor to reach
a state of half-full electronic configuration, whereas Cu2+ with the valence electronic configuration 3d9 is considered
as the electron acceptor to form the stable valence electronic structure.
This suggests that Ni2+ probably provides an electron to
Cu2+ through the lattice oxygen in the LDH interlayers.

2.2 Heterogeneous Fenton-like Performance
2.2.1 Effect of Different Compositions in Cu-LDHs
The Fenton-like
performance of different materials was evaluated
by the degradation of FF under dark conditions. As seen in Figure 5a, the catalytic
activity of different metal cation compositions in Cu-LDHs was investigated.
The results clearly revealed that CuNiFeLa-LDH exhibited the best
Fenton-like reactivity among these LDHs. Compared to CuNiFe-LDH, the
introduction of La3+ can enhance the degradation of FF,
indicating that the element La can improve the degradation efficiency
in the Fenton-reaction system. The degradation rate of FF by CuFe-LDH
was fast in the first 5 min. However, it almost remained unchanged
after 10 min for the collapse of brucite-like layers of CuFe-LDH and
increased the consumption of the active species. Besides these, the
concentration of FF remained nearly unchanged with the presence of
NiFe-LDH or CuMgFeLa-LDH. A blank experiment without catalysts was
also executed to prove that FF was scarcely degraded with the absence
of catalysts. The apparent rate constants of different materials can
be calculated and the values are exhibited in Figure 5c. The results signified that CuNiFeLa-LDH
possessed the highest Fenton-like reactivity with the apparent rate
constant kapp = 0.01338 min–1. According to these facts, the high efficiency of FF degradation
can be speculated as the coexistence of Cu and Ni, which might activate
the catalytic activity of the material due to the unique valence electronic
structures of these two metal ions. The doping of La can fabricate
more mesopores in the material and contribute both base and acid properties
in the reaction system, which can enhance the removal efficiency in
our experiment.43

CuNiFeLa-LDHs. Conditions: [H2O2] = 5 mmol L–1, [catalyst] = 0.25 g L–1, [FF]
= 10 mg L–1, natural pH.

2.2.2 Effect of La Contents in CuNiFeLa-LDH
The optimum content of La dopants in CuNiFeLa-LDHs in the Fenton-like
reaction was evaluated as shown in Figure 5b. It presented that the optimum catalytic
reactivity of CuNiFeLa-LDH is with the molar ratio up to 0.1 (La3+/Fe3+ + La3+). However, excessive La
dopants can cause collapse of the layered structure according to XRD
analysis, resulting in the reduction of reactive sites. The apparent
rate constants demonstrated that CuNiFeLa-2-LDH has the higher catalytic
reactivity (kapp = 0.01338 min–1) than other La dopants (Figure 5d).

2.2.3 Influence Factors
The influence
factors in the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH
was evaluated. The concentration of H2O2 on
the degradation of FF is shown in Figure 6a. It turned out that the removal rate of
FF was enhanced with the increase of the H2O2 concentration. The improved degradation rate was attributed to the
more amount of H2O2 that reacted with the catalyst
to promote the production of active species. The effect of the initial
FF concentration was investigated with the concentration from 5 to
20 mg L–1. As depicted in Figure 6b, FF in solution after the treatment was
not detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) (detection
limit: 50 μg L–1) with the initial concentration
of 5 mg L–1 after 180 min, basically achieving almost
complete degradation under a low dosage of H2O2 conditions. However, the removal rate decreased with the increase
of the FF concentration for the limited active sites at the given
dosage of the catalyst. Figure S4 shows
the effect factor of the catalyst dosage from 0.25 to 1.0 g L–1 on the degradation of FF. It was clearly observed
that the degradation rate of FF was slightly improved with the increase
of the catalyst dosage. In other words, a small amount of catalyst
exhibited a good Fenton-like catalytic effect under experimental conditions.

2.3 Degradation of Other Antibiotics by CuNiFeLa-LDH
To verify that CuNiFeLa-LDH is suitable for the degradation of
other antibiotics, the same removal procedure of IBF, DCF, and PR
were implemented. From Figure 7, the result showed that the removal efficiency can reach
over 95% of the three antibiotics after 180 min. This indicates that
CuNiFeLa-LDH can be used to degrade different pollutants in aqueous
solution with applicability.

Conditions:

2.4 Reusability
and Stability of CuNiFeLa-LDH
The reusability and stability
of the catalyst are crucial for its
practical application. The five cycling tests of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH were
carried out with the same reaction procedure on the degradation of
FF. As shown in Figure 8a, the catalytic activity of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH did not obviously decrease
at the end of repeated five runs. Figure 3b displays the full XPS spectrum of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH
before and after the reaction. The spectra show similar XPS patterns
and the elements Cu, Ni, Fe, La, C, and O were still included, which
demonstrated that there is little change in elemental composition
over the sample after the reaction. Interestingly, only 0.229 mg L–1 Cu was detected after the reaction. It is much lower
than the regulation of EU (<2 mg L–1) and USA
(<1.3 mg L–1), indicating that it is a stable
material used as a Fenton-like catalyst on the degradation of pollutants.

Figure 8 (a) Cycling
tests for the degradation of FF, (b) the initial pH
value of heterogeneous Fenton-like performance on the degradation
of FF by CuNiFeLa-2-LDH (insert: detection of pH value change under
different initial pH values).

To explore the environmental adaptability of the material,
the
initial pH value of FF solution was considered with the pH changing
from 5.0 to 9.0. As described in Figure 8b, the initial pH value exhibited little
influence on the degradation rate, indicating that CuNiFeLa-2-LDH
has a good degradation effect for FF over a wide pH range. The inserted
figure shows the data for pH change during the degradation process.
As shown in the results, regardless of different initial pH values,
it eventually tended to the similar neutral pH range. In a way, it
proved that this material possessed satisfied pH adaptability in aqueous
solution and circumvented the requirement of low pH values in the
traditional Fenton reaction. Therefore, these results evidenced that
CuNiFeLa-2-LDH was a stable and reliable Fenton-like material under
the experimental conditions.

2.5 Catalytical Mechanisms
Generally,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Fenton-like reaction system always
act as the main active substances to oxidize organics and achieve
the purpose of degradation and mineralization of pollutants in the
heterogeneous Fenton-like process.44,45 To clarify the contributions of
each ROS for the degradation of FF using CuNiFeLa-2-LDH, the scavenger
experiments of O21, •O2–, and •OH were implemented
using NaN3, BQ, and TBA, respectively, under different
concentration gradients. Figure 9a illustrates the results of each scavenger for the
degradation of FF over CuNiFeLa-2-LDH. The degradation efficiency
of FF was ∼96.8% without the scavenger. However, a phenomenon
of dramatic decrease of the removal rate occurred after the three
scavengers with high concentrations were added separately. Compared
with the absence of scavengers, the removal rates were reduced by
92.4, 91.6, and 90.3%, respectively. The accession of NaN3, BQ, and TBA with the concentration from 0.01 to 5 mmol L–1 obstructed the reaction between the catalyst and H2O2 in some degree, apparently manifesting that the inhibitory
effect on degradation of FF was significant with the increase of scavengers.
These above phenomena indicated two facts: (1) the three ROS O21, •O2–, and •OH were involved in the reaction system
and played important roles in the degradation of FF, (2) the actuality
of the addition of one capture agent with a high concentration inhibited
the entire reaction, demonstrating the interaction among the three
active species during the process.

sulfoxide (DMSO) dispersions, (d) O21 in aqueous
suspensions with and without CuNiFeLa-2-LDH or H2O2.

To further directly detect the
generation of ROS in the experimental
procedure, the DMPO-trapped ESR technique was employed with and without
CuNiFeLa-2-LDH or H2O2. As shown in Figure 9b, the signal of
four quintessential strong characteristic peaks of DMPO–•OH was detected with the ratio of 1:2:2:1 in the presence
of the catalyst and H2O2 in aqueous suspension.
Because only the catalyst or H2O2 existed in
aqueous suspensions, the •OH signals was hardly
measured by DMPO spin trapping. A similar phenomenon also appeared
in the generation of •O2– as depicted in Figure 9c. It was clearly observed that the characteristic peaks of DMPO–•O2– were detected in DMSO
dispersions over CuNiFeLa-2-LDH with H2O2. In
the situation of H2O2 or catalyst isolated,
the peaks of •O2– did
not appear. The signals of O21 were detected
by TEMP spin trapping according to Figure 9d. It exhibited three characteristic
1:1:1 triplet peaks which are in correspondence with previous reports,46,47 indicating the generation of O21 during the
reaction process. However, the slight peak value was also detected
without the catalyst in this detection, which can be explained by
the production from dissolved oxygen.48 The above facts further implied that •OH, •O2–, and O21 were regenerated and played vital roles as active species
in this heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction, which evidenced that H2O2 was predominantly reduced as well as oxidized
in the presence of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH.

In addition, the PL spectra
were implemented to reflect the amount
of •OH generated in the process. It was reported
that benzoic acid reacted with •OH, which can produce
fluorescent substance hydroxybenzoic acid.49 The hydroxybenzoic acid with fluorescent signals can be measured
by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and the amount of •OH was quantified by the PL intensity. Figure 10a shows the PL spectra on the degradation
of FF with the excitation wavelength at 316 nm under different reaction
conditions. Compared to the absence of the catalyst and H2O2, it was obviously observed that a large amount of hydroxyl
groups was produced in the solution with the addition of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH.
The inset manifested that the amount of hydroxyl groups intensified
as the reaction time increased at an emission wavelength of 416 nm.
It further illustrated that the production of the active species of
the system is attributed to the interaction of the catalyst and H2O2.

reaction conditions

PL intensities with the increased reaction time). (b) Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectrum of different materials. The
high-resolution XPS spectrum of (c) Cu 2p and (d) Ni 2p after the
reaction.

Figure 5a has shown
that the coexistence of Cu and Ni in LDHs can activate H2O2 to degrade FF, possibly for the promotion of the electron
transfer. Meanwhile, La doping can improve the oxidation between the
pollutant and the catalyst. To verify these above analyses, the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots was performed to evaluate
the electron transfer rate between metals ions. Generally, the narrow
arcs of EIS spectra represent the faster electron transfer rate. As
shown in Figure 10b, the size of the arcs followed the order of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH <
CuNiFe-LDH < NiFe-LDH < CuNiFeLa-2-LDH (without H2O2), which illustrated that the addition of Ni and La
further accelerated the electron transfer rate in the experimental
procedure. Moreover, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Cu and Ni
after the reaction was investigated. As presented in Figure 10c,d, the atomic ratios of
Cu2+/Cu+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ were changed after the reaction. The proportion of Cu2+/Cu+ equals to 0.82:1 which is much lower than that of
the ratio before the reaction (Cu2+/Cu+ = 2.58:1).
The increased Cu+ composition further confirmed the possible
electron transfer from Ni2+ to Cu2+.

Therefore,
based on the above results, the possible mechanisms
for the degradation of FF by the CuNiFeLa-2-LDH catalyst are proposed.
First, the layered structure of hydrotalcite-like LDH provides more
active sites for the degradation of pollutants in this Cu-dominated
Fenton-like reaction. Second, a large number of Ni2+ on
the catalyst surface with the unique electronic structure can transfer
electrons to Cu2+ to produce more Cu+ through
the M–O–M structure in the LDH lattice, which is better
for the Fenton-like reaction, because the reaction rate constant of
Cu+–H2O2 (1 × 104 M–1 S–1) is higher than
Cu2+–H2O2 (4.6 × 102 M–1 S–1). The Cu+ can directly react with H2O2 to produce
hydroxyl radicals. The accelerated cycle of Cu2+/Cu+ promoted the production of ROS. Third, the La2O3 existing in the layer of CuNiFeLa-2-LDH, which was
confirmed by XPS analysis, can provide Lewis basic and Lewis acidic
sites simultaneously. Besides, its surface lattice oxygen
provides Lewis basic sites, whereas metal ions provide Lewis acidic
sites.50,51 Lewis acids can act as catalysts to promote
the oxidation between the substrates and oxidants, further to accelerate
the electron transfer rate and enhance the catalytic effect in this
Fenton-like reaction system.52 In addition,
the La doping fabricated more mesopores in the material and showed
a large specific surface area, making the entrance of FF into the
sample more easy. Fourth, the production of •OH, •O2–, and O21 reactive species were ascribed to the interaction of
CuNiFeLa-2-LDH and H2O2, which can directly
attack FF further to oxidize it. However, Fe3+ in the brucite-like
sheets may not act as the main Fenton-like activity metal ions according
to the poor performance of NiFe-LDH on FF degradation. It can be explained
by the lower reaction rate of Fe3+–H2O2 ((1–2) × 10–2 M–1 S–1) compared with Cu2+–H2O2 (1 × 104 M–1 S–1). Therefore, the role of Fe3+ in
this Fenton system can be ignored and it is mainly used for maintaining
the layered structure of LDHs. According to the above discussion,
the schematic illustration of the possible mechanism is depicted in Figure 11. The reaction
procedure between CuNiFeLa-2-LDH and H2O2 was
explored and presented in the following steps. An electron was transferred
from Ni2+ to Cu2+ which can produce more Cu+ through the M–O–M structure (eq 5). The reaction between Cu2+/Cu+ and H2O2 engender HO2• and •OH (eqs 6 and 7).53 The high redox potential of Ni3+/Ni2+ can also oxidize H2O2 to produce HO2• (eq 8).54 Meanwhile, HO2• can break down into •O2– (eq 9) and further produce inefficient O2 (eq 10). Besides, the production of O21 might be acquired from two aspects. First, the
redox potential of •OH/OH– (E0(•OH/OH–) = 1.99 eV) is more positive than that of O21/•O2– (E0(O21/•O2–) = 0.97 eV),55 resulting
in the generation of O21 between radicals, which
is consistent with scavenger experiments (eq 11). Second, the dissolved oxygen may participate
in the production of O21 according to ESR analysis
(eq 12). The existence
of La3+ can accelerate the electron transfer rate and enhance
the catalytic activity. After that, the generation of •OH, •O2–, and O21 with high oxidation activity can attack FF in
the aqueous solution (eq 13). 5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a series of novel Cu-based multi-metal CuNiFeLa-LDHs
were prepared by a convenient co-precipitation method. The Fenton-like
reaction activities of the materials were evaluated by FF degradation
tests in the aqueous solution under dark conditions. The results showed
that the La-doped CuNiFe-LDH, with the La3+/(Fe3+ + La3+) = 0.1 and 5 mmol L–1 H2O2, exhibited high catalytic activity at room temperature
and a wide pH range. The removal efficiency of IBE, DCF, and PR can
also reach over 95% after 180 min, indicating that it is suitable
to degrade different antibiotics in aqueous solution. The enhanced catalytic activity
compared to other LDHs was ascribed to the coexistence of Cu+/Cu2+, Ni3+/Ni2+, and La2O3, leading to the typical promotion effect during the
reaction process. The introduction of Ni2+/Ni3+ into the lattice of LDH can facilitate the electron transfer of
Cu+/Cu2+. The La doping can improve the oxidation
between the substrates and oxidants and provide more mesopores and
large specific area in the catalyst, resulting in the increased reaction
activity sites and the production of •OH, •O2–, and O21 species.
Moreover, the catalyst was evidenced to have a wide pH adaptability
in the range from 5 to 9 and little copper liberation during the reaction,
further demonstrating that the CuNiFeLa-LDH material is a promising
Fenton-like catalyst with stability and applicability to purify polluted
water containing refractory VAs, FF.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Cupric nitrate trihydrate
(Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, AR grade), nickel
nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, AR grade), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, AR grade), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, AR grade), hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2, 30%, w/w), p-benzoquinone
(C6H4O2, CP grade), tert-butanol (C4H10O, CP grade), and sodium azide
(NaN3, AR grade) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd (China). Florfenicol (C12H14Cl2FNO4S, 98%) were purchased from Adamas Reagent.
5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO, C6H11NO, for ESR-spectroscopy) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, C2H6SO,
99.8%) and 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP, C9H20N2, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin. All
required concentrations of the experimental solutions were diluted
with ultrapure water produced from a Milli-Q device (18.2 MΩ
cm at 25 °C).

4.2 Synthesis of Cu-Based LDH
Materials
A series of CuNiFeLa-LDHs intercalated with carbonate
anions were
synthesized by the co-precipitation method at room temperature. Briefly,
certain amounts of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and La(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 200 mL ultrapure water
(solution A), where the molar ratio of Cu2+/Ni2+ = 1:3, M2+/M3+ = 2:1, and La3+/(Fe3+ + La3+) = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, respectively.
Another 100 mL solution containing NaOH (0.5 mol L–1) and Na2CO3 (0.1 mol L–1) was also prepared (solution B). Then, solutions A and B were simultaneously
added dropwise into 100 mL ultrapure water with continuous stirring.
The dropping rate was adjusted to keep the solution pH at 9.0 ±
0.2 during the reaction process. After that, the resulting slurry
was aged at 40 °C for 24 h. The obtained solution was filtered
using 0.45 μm filter membranes and washed with ultrapure water
until the supernatant reached a neutral pH value. The acquired solid
material was finally dried at 40 °C overnight and then ground
into powder. For identification, different products of La-doped materials
were donated as CuNiFeLa-1-LDH, CuNiFeLa-2-LDH, CuNiFeLa-3-LDH, and
CuNiFeLa-4-LDH, respectively. Above these, CuFe-LDH, CuNiFe-LDH, NiFe-LDH,
and CuMgFeLa-LDH were also prepared with the same procedure.

4.3 Characterization of Materials
The
metal contents of the materials were determined by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) Agilent 720 (Agilent).
The solid structures of these materials were recorded by a D-8 Advance
X-ray diffractometer (Bruker-AXS, Germany). The Fourier transfer infrared
(FTIR) spectrum was measured by Bruker Tensor37 (Bruker-AXS, Germany)
FTIR instrument. The BET surface area, total pore volume, and pore
size distribution of the material were determined by the Autosorb-iQ
analyzer (Quantachrome). The ζ-potential of the typical sample
was measured by using a Zetasizer apparatus (Nano Z, Malvern, U.K.)
with pH ranging from 6.0 to 10.0. The surface morphology and element
mapping of the catalysts were obtained by using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM, Nova nanoSEM 450, FEI, Netherlands) equipped with
an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and a transmission electron
microscope (TEM, JEM-2011, JEOL, Japan). The electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) of each sample was performed by using a three-electrode
electrochemical cell equipped with a catalyst anode and a platinum
wire cathode in a 0.5 mol L–1 Na2SO4 solution, and regarded the saturated calomel electrode as
the reference electrode. The functional groups and related oxidation
states on the surface of the materials were characterized with X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The binding energy of C 1s was set
at 284.6 eV which is used as the reference for adjusting other peak
positions.

4.4 Fenton-like Reaction Experiment
The
Fenton-like reaction activities of the materials were evaluated by
degrading FF solutions under dark conditions with continuous magnetic
stirring. In a typical Fenton-like catalytic procedure, a certain
amount of powder was dispersed into 50.0 mL FF solution at room temperature
and then the solution was stirred for 30 min to establish the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. After that, a certain amount of H2O2 was added to initiate the reaction. At given time intervals, 1.5
mL aliquots were collected from the suspension and filtered with 0.22
μm membranes to remove the filtered solids. The experimental
procedure of IBF, DCF, and PR degradation is the same with FF.

4.5 Analytical Methods
The florfenicol
concentrations in the filtered aqueous solution were determined by
ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with an UV–vis
photodiode array detector and an ACQUITY UPC2 BEH C18 column:
100 × 3.0 mm2, 1.7 μm particle size. The ultrapure
water and acetonitrile were used as the mobile phase with the ratio
of 70:30 (water/acetonitrile). The detection limit of FF in this UPLC
was 50 μg L–1.

To compare the degradation
rate of FF with different catalysts, the apparent rate constant was
used to quantitate it, which is expressed as kapp (min–1).
