The effect of water on the hydrogen
abstraction mechanism and product
branching ratio of CH3CH2OH + •OH reaction has been investigated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//BH&HLYP/aug-cc-pVTZ
level of theory, coupled with the reaction kinetics calculations,
implying the harmonic transition-state theory. Depending on the hydrogen
sites in CH3CH2OH, the bared reaction proceeds
through three elementary paths, producing CH2CH2OH, CH3CH2O, and CH3CHOH and releasing
a water molecule. Thermodynamic and kinetic results indicate that
the formation of CH3CHOH is favored over the temperature
range of 216.7–425.0 K. With the inclusion of water, the reaction
becomes quite complex, yielding five paths initiated by three channels.
The products do not change compared with the bared reaction, but the
preference for forming CH3CHOH drops by up to 2%. In the
absence of water, the room temperature rate coefficients for the formation
of CH2CH2OH, CH3CH2O,
and CH3CHOH are computed to be 5.2 × 10–13, 8.6 × 10–14, and 9.0 × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, respectively. The effective rate coefficients of corresponding
monohydrated and dihydrated reactions are 3–5 and 6–8
orders of magnitude lower than those of the unhydrated reaction, indicating
that water has a decelerating effect on the studied reaction. Overall,
the characterized effects of water on the thermodynamics, kinetics,
and products of the CH3CH2OH + •OH reaction will facilitate the understanding of the fate of ethanol
and secondary pollutants derived from it.

1 Introduction
Environmental
and energetic crises have led to the increasing use
of ethanol (CH3CH2OH) as one of the environment
friendly and renewable biofuels and especially as a fuel additive
or extender.1,2 The enhanced use of ethanol is
likely to result in its increased release into the atmosphere as unburnt
fuel, fugitive emissions, and discharge during its production. Besides,
ethanol is also acknowledged as a biogenic volatile organic compound
released from living plants with an emission rate of 26 (range, 10–38)
Tg year–1, which contributes significantly to a
total global ethanol source of 42 (range, 25–56) Tg year–1.1,3 In the atmosphere, most of ethanol
is in its ground state and about three-quarters of ethanol are removed
by the reaction with hydroxyl radicals in the gaseous and aqueous
phases, occurring on a time scale of 4 days, and the remainder is
lost through dry deposition and wet scavenging.1,4,5 In the oxidation reaction, a hydroxyl radical
can attack and abstract one hydrogen atom of the ground-state ethanol
from three different sites (methyl, hydroxyl, and methylene), leading
to the formation of different C2H5O isomers. 1a  

These C2H5O isomers
subsequently undergo
atmospheric oxidation with molecular oxygen to generate important
secondary pollutants and radicals. Formaldehyde is primarily formed
from the β-hydroxyalkyl radical produced from eq 1a through the following processes4,6−8 2   3   4   5  

The alkoxy and α-hydroxyalkyl radicals produced via eqs 1b and 1c react with
molecular oxygen to form acetaldehyde and the hydroperoxyl radical.4,6,8,9 6   7  

Further oxidation
of acetaldehyde may contribute to the formation
of peroxyacetylnitrate and ozone, affecting the partitioning and fate
of reactive nitrogen (NOy), therefore
increasing the atmospheric oxidizing capacity and also enhancing the
role of ethanol as a precursor for the formation of secondary aerosols.4,6,7,10

Given the atmospheric importance of hazardous air pollutants and
free radicals generated from the oxidation of C2H5O isomers, the rate coefficients and branching ratios for elementary
oxidation (eqs 1a–1c) of ethanol have been extensively studied using
experimental and theoretical methods.6,11−15 Dillon et al. obtained an overall reaction rate coefficient (by
summing up the rate coefficients of elementary eqs 1a–1c) of 4.0
× 1012 × exp(−42/T) over
the temperature range of 216–368 K using a pulsed laser photolysis
technique coupled with pulsed laser-induced fluorescence detection
of the •OH radical.12 Theoretically, at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,2p)//MP2/6-311+G(3df,2p)
level, the kinetics and mechanisms for •OH + C2H5OH reactions were studied over the temperature
range of 200–3000 K by Xu and Lin.16 They found that over 800 K, the predicted overall rate coefficients
and the branching ratio of eq 1c were significantly
higher than the modeled values by Marinov.17 Sivaramakrishnan and co-workers also studied the •OH oxidation of ethanol and determined Arrhenius expressions of the
total and channel-specific rate coefficients over the temperature
range of 200–2500 K.13 These studies
focused on unhydrated reactions to find accurate Arrhenius expressions
for rate coefficients over a wide temperature range. However, water
is ubiquitous in the troposphere and because of its ability to act
as hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen bond donor, it would most likely
affect the reaction rates and products’ branching ratio of
C2H5O + •OH reaction.

It is evident from the literature that water can easily form hydrogen-bonded
complexes with various species in the gas phase and thus dramatically
affects their photochemical properties and heterogeneous removal.18−21 These influences have been proven to be catalytic, suppressive,
and anti-catalytic effects.22−25 For example, it was shown that the rate coefficient
for the self-reaction of HO2 to yield H2O2 and O2 is somewhat faster in the presence of water
than in its absence.23 Du and Zhang used
the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//BH&HLYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) method
to calculate the rate coefficients for H2S and •OH reaction without and with catalyst X (X = H2O, (H2O)2, or H2S) by employing conventional
transition-state theory, and they concluded that the presence of X
would not play an important role in the oxidation of H2S by •OH radicals under atmospheric conditions.24 Some recent studies, however, showed inhibitive
effects of water in hydrogen abstraction reactions involving ClO.26−28 Interestingly, for the reaction of CH3OH + ClO, the effect
of water was found to be much more negative on the formation of HOCl
+ CH2OH than on the formation of HOCl + CH3O.26 For the reaction between the HCOOH···H2O complex and the hydroxy radical, the rate coefficient was
4 times lower than that of the bared reaction.29 It is worth noting that water extensively alters the branching
ratio of this reaction. For the bared reaction, the branching ratio
of formyl hydrogen abstraction that leads to the formation of HOCO
is 7%, while the acidic hydrogen abstraction that produces HCOO accounts
for 93%. However, starting from the HCOOH ··· H2O complex, the branching ratio for the formation of HOCO is
90.5% and only 9.5% for HCOO. Recently, a quadratic dependence of
the overall reaction rate coefficient on relative humidity (RH) under
quasi-real atmospheric conditions was found for the oxidation reaction
of C2H5OH by the hydroxyl radical.30 It is clear that water may play different roles
on the radical–molecule reactions, change their products’
branching ratios, and thus influence the atmospheric fate of both
the radical and pollutant molecules as well as their products. Herein,
determining different water effects on reaction rates and product
branching ratios of atmospheric-related substances is critical to
understanding their atmospheric chemistry. Accordingly, ignoring these
water effects could lead to inaccuracies of certain atmospheric models.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has focused
on cumulative water effects on branching ratios of the reaction between
ethanol and the hydroxyl radical.

Based on the atmospheric significance
of ethanol and water, the
bared CH3CH2OH + OH reaction and a single water-assisted
reaction are explored. We analyze the possible role of water on altering
the potential energy surface (PES), the rate coefficients, and the
branching ratios of this reaction under different atmospheric temperatures.
Besides, given the high water dimer concentration,31,32 recent research studies have also evidenced that two water molecules
may play a significant role on the kinetics of various atmospheric
reactions.33−35 Hence, the effect of the water dimer is included
in the CH3CH2OH + •OH reaction
as well.

2 Results and Discussion
In the following,
the different reactant intermediates and reaction
paths in which the hydroxyl radical abstracts one hydrogen atom from
the methyl site, hydroxyl site, and methylene site on ethanol are
marked with letters a, b, and c, respectively. Numbers following a
letter are used to distinguish the different •OH
attacks on the same site. Prereactive complexes, transition states,
postreactive complexes, and products of the elementary paths are named
by prefixes CR, TS, CP, and Pro, respectively. Besides, in the reactions
involving (H2O)n (n = 1–2), W or WW are added as postfixes to denote mono- and
dihydrates, respectively.

2.1 PESs for CH3CH2OH + •OH Reaction in the Absence
of Water
Three
elementary reaction paths have been found depending on the ethanol
hydrogen [−OH, −CH2– (α-hydrogen),
−CH3 (β-hydrogen)] abstracted by the hydroxyl
radical. Though ethanol has three conformational structures,15 only the lowest energy ones along three reaction
paths are shown in Figure 1. Here, this reaction takes place by the formation of two
types of prereactive complexes (transconformation for CR-a and CR-c,
and gauche conformation for CR-b), in which a hydrogen bond is formed
between the oxygen atom of ethanol and the hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl
radical.15,36 The length of the hydrogen bond is 1.9 Å
in the prereactive transconformation, which is in agreement with the
corresponding value in the previous study.14 Path (a) and path (c) both start with the formation of the same
prereactive complex, CR-a, formed with −5.2 kcal mol–1 binding energy (Table 1). CR-a rearranges through the TS-a transition-state configuration
located at 0.6 kcal mol–1 above the initial reactants
to form the postreactive complex CH2CH2OH···H2O. Path (c) proceeds through the TS-c transition state formed
with −1.8 kcal mol–1 energy, 2.4 kcal mol–1 lower than the TS-a energy to form the postreactive
complex CH3CHOH···H2O. The prereactive
complex CR-b in path (b) is formed with −5.1 kcal mol–1 binding energy and the corresponding transition state is located
at 1.6 kcal mol–1 above the reactants. The energy
barrier for this path is 6.7, 0.9, and 3.3 kcal mol–1 higher than the energy barriers of path (a) and path (c), respectively.
The high barrier might lead CH3CH2O formation
kinetically unfavorable.37 These energy
barriers are within 1 kcal mol–1 similar to the
corresponding values obtained at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,2p)//MP2/6-311+G(3df,2p)
level of theory.16 However, larger values
[9.1, 9.5, and 7.0 kcal mol–1 for path (a), path
(b), and path (c), respectively] were reported in another study that
used the CCSD(T)//BH&HLYP/6-311G(d,p) method.14 The relative energies of CH2CH2OH
+ H2O, CH3CH2O + H2O,
and CH3CHOH + H2O formation are −15.6,
−13.6, and −22.7 kcal mol–1, respectively,
which is in good agreement with other theoretical values of −15.5,
−13.3, and −22.9 kcal mol–1 reported
previously.16 These values are within ∼2
kcal mol–1 similar to the corresponding experimental
values, 13.05 ± 0.09, −13.84 ± 0.65, and −25.79
± 0.91 kcal mol–1, respectively.38,39 In terms of the Gibbs free energy change at 1 atm and 298.2 K, the
formation of CH3CHOH + H2O [path (c)] is the
most energetically favorable with ΔG = −24.2
kcal mol–1. The formation of CH3CHOH
+ H2O was found to be the predominant hydrogen abstraction
reaction at all temperatures.6,13,14,16

2.2 PESs for the CH3CH2OH
+ •OH Reaction in the Presence of One Water Molecule
The PES for the hydrogen abstraction reaction in the presence of
one water molecule (Figures 2 and S1 in the Supporting Information) appears to be more complicated than that of the naked reaction
due to more complex interactions between the three participating species,
though the final products do not change. The geometries of the stationary
points involved in Figure 2 are provided in Figure 3, while corresponding zero-point energy (ZPE), relative
energies, enthalpies, and Gibbs free energies can be found in Table 2. Because the possibility
of the simultaneous collision of separated ethanol, the hydroxyl radical
and water molecule is extremely low, and a more likely scenario is
that the reaction involving one water molecule would initially occur
through the formation of a two-body complex, followed by its further
collision with the third body in the reaction system to form the ternary
prereactive complex.35,40 The most likely two-body complexes
to form first are •OH···H2O, CH3CH2OH···H2O,
and H2O···CH3CH2OH.

level of theory. The electronic energy values are obtained at the

The OH···H2O complex results from the
interaction between the hydrogen atom of OH and the oxygen atom of
water, forming a hydrogen bond with a length of 1.9 Å. This complex
is formed with −3.9 kcal mol–1 binding energy.
Both the energy and geometry of •OH···H2O exhibit excellent uniformity with the results of previous
studies.24,29,41 The binary
complexes CH3CH2OH···H2O and H2O···CH3CH2OH are formed with −3.7 and −4.4 kcal mol–1 binding energies, respectively. They differ from each other by the
type of the hydrogen bond formed within their structures. In the CH3CH2OH···H2O complex,
water acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, forming a 2.0 Å hydrogen
bond with the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group, whereas a 1.9 Å
hydrogen bond is formed between one hydrogen atom of water and the
oxygen atom of ethanol in the H2O···CH3CH2OH complex.

The further reactions of •OH···H2O, CH3CH2OH···H2O, and H2O···CH3CH2OH with the third species are named channel
1, channel 2, and channel
3, respectively. These three channels give rise to five different
paths that ultimately form CH2CH2OH + 2H2O, CH3CHOH + 2H2O, and CH3CH2O + 2H2O.

The interaction of the CH3CH2OH molecule
with the •OH···H2O binary
complex as well as the interaction between the •OH radical and H2O···CH3CH2OH complex both lead to CR-a1-W, following path (a1-W). Compared
with CR-a in path (a), the newly formed hydrogen bond (1.8 Å)
between one hydrogen atom of water and the oxygen atom of ethanol
leads to the cyclic structure of CR-a1-W. The computed formation energy
of CR-a1-W is −10.7, 5.5 kcal mol–1 lower
than CR-a in path (a). CR-a1-W subsequently isomerizes to the corresponding
postreactive complex CP-a1-W via the TS-a1-W transition state, where
the oxygen of the hydroxyl radical directly abstracts one of the β-hydrogen
in the methyl group. The structure of TS-a1-W is more compact than
the CR-a1-W structure, and it is located at 5.7 kcal mol–1 energy below the separated reactants. CP-a1-W has a six-membered
ring structure stabilized by three hydrogen bonds between two water
molecules and the CH2CH2OH residue. The energy
barrier of this path is 0.8 kcal mol–1 lower than
that in path (a).

The •OH association with
CH3CH2OH···H2O forms
a six-membered ring-like
CR-a2-W ternary complex through path (a2-W) (see Figure S1). This complex is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds
where •OH, water, and ethanol all act as hydrogen
bond acceptors and donors simultaneously. CR-a2-W is 1.1 kcal mol–1 more stable than CR-a1-W, which is stabilized by
only two hydrogen bonds and a weak C···H···O
interaction. CR-a2-W rearranges through a TS-a2-W transition-state
configuration that lies below the reactants, with an eight-membered
ring structure and predicted to be formed with −6.5 kcal mol–1 energy. Despite the intermolecular distances among
CH3CH2OH, •OH, and H2O being shorter in TS-a1-W than in TS-a2-W, the energy of the latter
is 0.8 kcal mol–1 lower than that of the former,
clearly indicating that the oxygen of water is a much better hydrogen
bond acceptor than the oxygen of ethanol, while water also acts as
a hydrogen bond donor to the hydroxyl radical. CR-a2-W overcomes an
energy barrier of 5.3 kcal mol–1 to form the CP-a2-W
product complex, which further releases the same final products as
in path (a1-W).

For hydroxylic hydrogen abstraction, the ternary
prereactive complex
CR-b-W can be first formed through the three above channels. Water
and ethanol act as the hydrogen acceptor and donor simultaneously
in its six-membered ring structure, like the interaction between CH3OH, •OH, and H2O.40 The 2.1 Å hydrogen bond between oxygen
in the hydroxyl radical and hydrogen on the hydroxyl site of ethanol
indicates that the hydroxyl radical is in the favored position to
abstract the hydroxyl hydrogen as in the CR-b prereactive complex.
However, the energy barrier height to overcome by CR-b-W to form CH3CH2O through path (b-W) is 1.4 kcal mol–1 higher than in the corresponding barrierless path (b). This indicates
that a single water hampers the abstraction process of hydroxylic
hydrogen by the hydroxyl radical. Different from CP-a1-W with a six-membered
ring structure held by three hydrogen bonds, the CP-b-W formed in
path (b-W) has a seven-membered cyclic structure with a formation
energy of −22.9 kcal mol–1. It is stabilized
by one hydrogen bond (1.9 Å) formed between the oxygen atom of
ethanol and the hydrogen of initially added water and a new but weak
interaction (2.5 Å) between oxygen of newly formed water and
the α-hydrogen of the CH3CH2O residue.
The results suggest that the formation of postreactive complex CP-b-W
is structurally and energetically advantageous for the formation of
CH3CH2O + 2H2O final products.

The reorganization of hydrogen bonds between the three abovementioned
binary complexes and the third species give rise to CR-c1-W.25,42 Instead of acting as the hydrogen bond acceptor for the hydrogen
of •OH in CR-c, the oxygen atom of ethanol forms
a 1.8 Å hydrogen bond with the hydrogen of water. The hydrogen
of •OH then binds with the oxygen of water. Besides
these two hydrogen bonds, another weak interaction (3.1 Å) exists
between ethanol α-H and the oxygen in the hydroxyl radical.
This arrangement may facilitate the hydrogen abstraction from methylene
by the hydroxyl radical via the TS-c1-W transition state, as evidenced
by the decreased energy barrier relative to that in path (c). Contrary
to the seven-membered ring-like structure of TS-c1-W, CP-c1-W adopts
a six-membered ring structure, where a new hydrogen bond is formed
through interaction of the hydroxylic oxygen of ethanol and the hydrogen
of water. The energy barrier for this path (2.0 kcal mol–1) is 3.0 kcal mol–1 lower than that of path (a1-W).

Another path leading to the CH3CHOH + 2H2O products is path (c2-W), as shown in Figure S1. The prereactive CR-c2-W complex in this path is formed
by the H2O···CH3CH2OH + •OH reaction. It contains similar geometrical
features as CR-a2-W with a three-hydrogen bonded cyclic structure.
The abstraction of α-H by the hydroxyl radical in this path
occurs through the TS-c2-W transition state with a calculated energy
barrier of 3.8, 1.8 kcal mol–1 higher than that
in path (c1-W). This energy difference is the result of the difference
in hydrogen bond interactions in TS-c1-W and TS-c2-W structures. The
corresponding postreactive complexes CP-c1-W and CP-c2-W contain six-membered
ring structures in their configurations. CP-c1-W lies 35.1 kcal mol–1 below the isolated reactants, 0.5 kcal mol–1 above CP-c2-W. Therefore, given also the low energy barrier of path
(c1-W), it is reasonable to conclude that path (c1-W) is more favorable
than path (c2-W). Hence, for further analysis of the effect of water
on the reaction kinetics, solely, path (c1-W) will be considered.

2.3 PESs for CH3CH2OH + •OH Reaction in the Presence of Two Water Molecules
Based
on the multistep mechanism,43−45 the cyclic ternary complexes
CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O and •OH····H2O···H2O with binding energies of −12.3
and −10.5 kcal mol–1, respectively, can form
when two water molecules are involved. These complexes can collide
with •OH and CH3CH2OH, respectively
to initiate the reaction. The interplay of the H2O···CH3CH2OH cluster and •OH···H2O cluster is also estimated to generate the same final products
as the two abovementioned channels. Thus, the reaction between ethanol
and •OH in the presence of two water molecules could
proceed through these three entrance channels, labeled as channel
4, channel 5, and channel 6, respectively. These three channels give
rise to six paths [path (a1-WW) and path (a2-WW) for β-hydrogen
abstraction, path (c1-WW) and path (c2-WW) for α-hydrogen abstraction,
and path (b1-WW) and path (b2-WW) for hydroxylic hydrogen abstraction].
The stationary points in these paths adopt more complicated structures,
whose formations are energetically much more favorable than those
of corresponding unhydrated complexes. This may suggest that water
acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor in a cyclic structure
has the capability to stabilize complexes. According to the Gibbs
free energy changes in Table 3, the stationary points in the paths that lead to the same
products almost energetically degenerate, despite the relative positions
of ethanol, water, and •OH radical being different.
Hence, only representative paths (a1-WW), (b1-WW), and (c2-WW) are
discussed and related PES are shown in Figure 4, while the structures of all intermediate

The addition of the third species
to CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O or to •OH···H2O···H2O complexes leads to eight-membered
cyclic prereactive complexes,
CR-a1-WW and CR-b1-WW with −21.3 and −21.1 kcal mol–1 binding energies, respectively. As evidenced in Figure 5, •OH is located between two water molecules in CR-a1-WW, while it directly
forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxylic hydrogen on ethanol and the
oxygen atom of one of the water molecules in CR-b1-WW. The initial
CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O and •OH···H2O···H2O ternary complexes are stable enough
that their configurations are hardly affected when they interact with
the third species. Starting from the CR-a1-WW complex, the •OH radical extracts one of the β-hydrogen on ethanol in the
TS-a1-WW transition state, which has a two-cyclic structure. After
crossing the 5.1 kcal mol–1 energy barrier, the
CH2CH2OH residue and three water molecules rearrange
in the CP-a1-WW product state in such a way that the single ring structure
is restored. The formation energy of CP-a1-WW is −37.4 kcal
mol–1. Though the water dimer seems to stabilize
the intermediate species in path (a1-WW), the small 0.7 kcal mol–1 difference between the energy barrier in this path
and that of the corresponding unhydrated path suggests that the effect
of the water dimer on β-hydrogen abstraction by •OH is not significant. For the hydroxylic hydrogen abstraction by
OH through path (b1-WW), the orientation of •OH
in CR-b1-WW is beneficial for abstracting the hydroxylic hydrogen
of ethanol. The energy barrier to this abstraction was determined
to be 8.6 kcal mol–1. This value is 1.9 kcal mol–1 higher than that in path (b) and only 0.5 kcal mol–1 higher than that in path (b-W), indicating that the
negative effect of water on hydroxylic hydrogen abstraction is mainly
caused by one water molecule.

For the formation of CH3CHOH through path (c2-WW), the
prereactive complex CR-c2-WW is formed through •OH···H2O···H2O + CH3CH2OH and H2O···CH3CH2OH + •OH···H2O interactions. CR-c2-WW is structurally similar to CR-a1-WW,
but it only needs to surmount a 2.4 kcal mol–1 energy
barrier to form the postreactive complex CP-c2-WW, which quickly dissociates
into CH3CHOH + 3H2O. Compared to the corresponding
unhydrated path (c), the energy barrier is lower by 1.0 kcal mol–1, revealing a slight catalytic effect of two water
molecules on the formation of CH3CHOH.

The interaction
of H2O···CH3CH2OH
with •OH···H2O gives rise
to an additional path for CH3CH2O formation
(Figure S2). In this
path, the prereactive complex CR-b2-WW, which has an eight-membered
structure, is formed 21.2 kcal mol–1 below the reactants.
A multiple hydrogen transfer then occurs among •OH, two water molecules, and ethanol in the TS1-b2-WW transition
state to form the intermediate complex IM-b2-WW, which is energetically
and structurally similar to CR-b1-WW in path (b1-WW). TS1-b2-WW is
formed with a very high energy, 18.4 kcal mol–1,
and this path is likely negligible. This is similar to the observations
in previous hydrogen abstraction reactions involving a multihydrogen
transfer mechanism where water molecules actually serve as a bridge.24,33,43

Following the reaction
mechanisms discussed above, it is clear
that the presence of (H2O)n (n = 1–2) favors the formation of CH3CHOH, while lowering that of CH3CH2O
and CH2CH2OH. In a previous research study that
studied the water vapor effect on the atmospheric oxidation of CH3OOH by the •OH radical using the CCSD(T)/CBS//BH&HLYP/6-311+G(2df,2p)
method, it was found that water played different effects on the formation
of different products.25 However, it is
not strict to infer the possible effect of the water molecule on the
CH3CH2OH + •OH reaction based
on the changes in energy barrier exclusively because the concentrations
of the initially formed hydrated complexes are usually too small to
be relevant in the atmosphere.46−51 For example, it has been reported that the relative abundance of
the CH3OH···H2O complex at 50%
RH was lower than 0.02%.52 It is then necessary
to assess the reaction kinetics to better illustrate the water effect
on reaction of ethanol with the hydroxyl radical at tropospheric temperatures.

2.4 Reaction Kinetics
Making use of the
energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//BH&HLYP/aug-cc-pVTZ
level of theory (Table 1), the calculated rate coefficients for the bared reaction using eq 18 over the temperature
range of 216.7–425.0 K are listed in Table 4. It shows that at 216.7 K, the rate coefficient, kc, for the formation of CH3CHOH through
path (c), is about 3 orders of magnitude higher than ka (rate coefficient for the formation of CH2CH2OH) and 4 orders of magnitude higher than kb (rate coefficient for the formation of CH3CH2O). However, as the temperature increases, this advantage
is reduced to ∼2 orders of magnitude due to the fast increase
of ka and kb, especially ka. The CH2CH2OH branching ratio ra (ra = ka/ktotal, where ktotal is the
sum of ka, kb, kc) rises from 0.12% at 216.7 K to
0.57% at 298.2 K and reaches 1.89% at 425.00 K. In a previous study,
the channel-specific rate coefficients expressions ka = 1.03 × 10–20T2.68 exp(290 K/T) and kb = 4.67 × 10–22T2.97 exp(292 K/T) cm3 molecule–1 s–1 were derived.16 Our calculated rate coefficients ka and kb in the temperature range
of 216.7–298.2 K fit the values calculated from these expressions,
if small deviations caused by different theoretical methods are neglected.
However, the kc values computed in the
present study are higher than previously published values from the
following equation: kc = 2.17 × 10–19T2.43 exp(733 K/T) cm3 molecule–1 s–1.16 At room temperature 298.2 K, kc = 9.0 × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 in our
calculation, higher than 2.6 × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 calculated
according to the kc expression above.
There is a consensus that eq 1c should be
the predominant process in the •OH + CH3CH2OH reaction, with eqs 1a and 1b increasing in importance
as the temperature increases.14,16,31 Ethanol is considered as a precursor for acetaldehyde through its
CH3CHOH and CH3CH2O oxidation products.
The high product branching ratio of eq 1c suggests
that acetaldehyde might be generated from CH3CHOH predominately
over the studied temperature range.

rate coefficients of path (a), path (b), and path (c), respectively,
in the bared reaction, ktotal is the sum
of ka, kb,
and kc at a given temperature.

The monohydrated reaction proceeds
through formation of bimolecular
complexes between water and CH3CH2OH or •OH. Upon formation, each of these complexes reacts
with the third species to form the prereactive complex. The equilibrium
coefficients for the formation of the hydrated complex at different
temperatures are given in Table 5. For the formation of •OH···H2O, the equilibrium coefficient (Keq1) is 3.7 × 10–21 cm3 molecule–1. Considering the hydroxyl radical concentration of
2.7 × 107 molecules cm–3 and the
water concentration of 7.8 × 1017 molecules cm–3 at 298.2 K, the atmospheric concentration of the •OH···H2O complex is predicted
to be 7.7 × 104 molecule cm–3, which
is in good agreement with estimates reported in previous works.29,53 Assuming a tropospheric ethanol concentration of 8.1 × 107 molecule cm–3 (30 ppt), which is reasonable
in a polluted environment, the concentration of H2O···CH3CH2OH is estimated to be 5.0 × 104 molecule cm–3 at 298.2 K. Noting that at tropospheric
temperatures, only less than 0.01% of pure ethanol is in the hydrated
form, solely, the rate coefficients (kC1a1-W, kC1b-W, kC1c1-W) for the paths [path (a1-W), (b-W), and (c1-W),
respectively] that begin with •OH···H2O at the entrance channel are included in the following discussion.
The kinetics results of the other two channels can be found in Tables
S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information.

a kC1a1-W, kC1b-W, and kC1c1-W are the rate coefficients of path (a1-W),
path (b-W), and path (c1-W), respectively, via channel 1 in the water-assisted
reaction; kC1-W is the sum of kC1a1-W, kC1b-W, and kC1c1-W at temperature T.

For the reaction
involving two water molecules, the equilibrium
coefficients of the CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O complex (Keq4) are larger than those of the •OH···H2O···H2O complex (Keq5) (Table S4), and its subsequent
reactions are energetically more favorable. Hence, the kinetic calculation
results of the reaction initiated by the CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O complex are listed in Table S5. The
rate coefficients for the reaction through path (a1-WW), (b1-WW),
and (c1-WW) are denoted as kC4a1-WW, kC4b-WW, and kC4c2-WW, respectively. The total rate coefficient kC4-WW is the sum of kC4a1-WW, kC4b-WW, and kC4c2-WW.

The total
rate coefficients for the reaction of CH3CH2OH with •OH in all cases have a negative
temperature dependence due to the rate coefficients of the predominant
path (c1-W), that decrease with increasing temperature. At 298.2 K
and 100% RH, our calculated total rate coefficient for the monohydrated
reaction is 3.6 × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, about 1 order of magnitude
higher than the experimental value (∼7 × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1) obtained at 100% RH and 294 K (Table 6).30 For the formation
of CH3CHOH, only a small catalytic effect of one water
molecule can be observed under 249.3 K. The rate coefficient kc increases faster than kC1c1-W as the temperature increases. The ratio of kc/kC1c1-W surpasses 1.0 above 249.3 K and rises up to 11.9 at 425.0 K, indicating
that the effect of one water molecule is inversed when the temperature
exceeds 249.3 K. A similar situation has also been observed in earlier
studies that focused on the impact of water on the •OH + HOCl reaction.43 Compared to the
bared reaction, the presence of one water molecule has a slightly
negative effect on the formation of CH2CH2OH
and CH3CH2O. The value of ka/kC1a1-W reaches 4.3,
whereas kb/kC1b1-W reaches 4.5 at 298.2 K. These ratios are computed to be larger than
10 at higher temperatures. Besides, the presence of one water molecule
reduces the products’ branching ratio of CH2CH2OH and CH3CH2O at 298.2 K (by 0.23 and
0.04%, respectively), while increasing that of CH3CHOH
by 0.27% at the same temperature.

Contrary to the inhibitive
effect of one water molecule, the rate
coefficients, kC4a1-WW, for the
formation of CH2CH2OH, are 2–3 orders
of magnitude higher than those of the bared reaction over the studied
temperature range. kC4b1-WW and kC4c1-WW are also observed to increase
by about 1 order of magnitude within the same temperature range. Compared
to the water-free case at 298.2 K, the branching ratio of CH2CH2OH (kC4a1-WW/kC4-WW, 2.39%) in the presence of two
water molecules increases by 4 times while that of CH3CHOH
(kC4c1-WW/kC4-WW) reduces by 1.79%. This suggests that the role
of ethanol as the precursor of formaldehyde and peroxyl radicals,
which can be produced through further oxidation of CH2CH2OH, may be enhanced in the atmosphere by the presence of two
water molecules.

To practically and comprehensively illustrate
the effect of (H2O)n (n = 1–2)
on the studied reaction, the effective rate coefficients (k′) that take into account the concentration of water
need to be evaluated. The rates for the reactions in the absence of
water and in the presence of one and two water molecules are given
by the following equations, respectively 8   9   10  where kC1-W′ and kC4-WW′ are the effective rate coefficients
in the presence
of one and two water molecules, respectively, and are given as 11   12  

Here, the concentrations of the water
molecule and water dimer
at 298.2 K and 100% RH are calculated to be 7.8 × 1017 and 3.5 × 1014 molecules cm–3,
respectively.24 Based on the different
hydrogen abstraction sites on ethanol, the corresponding effective
rate coefficients are listed in Tables 7 and S6. Additionally, to
clearly reveal the effect of (H2O)n (n = 1–2) on the investigated reaction,
direct comparison between effective rate coefficients for reactions
involving (H2O)n (n = 1–2) and rate coefficients for the bared reaction is shown
in Table 8. The results
show that the reactions beginning with •OH···H2O + CH3CH2OH at the entrance channel
are 3 to 5 orders of magnitude slower than the reactions in the absence
of water, indicating that water effectively hinders the reactions
between ethanol and the hydroxyl radical. For the hydrogen abstraction
from the hydroxyl and methylene groups in the CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O + •OH channel, the values of the effective
rate coefficients are 7–8 orders of magnitude lower than those
of the bared reaction. An obvious suppressive effect of two water
molecules on methylic hydrogen abstraction is also predicted with
effective rate coefficients 6–7 orders of magnitude lower than
the rate coefficients of the unhydrated reactions. From this perspective,
it is concluded that the presence of (H2O)n (n = 1–2) actually slows
down the CH3CH2OH + •OH reaction
over the temperature range of 216.7–425.0 K.

3 Conclusions
The gas-phase reaction of ethanol
and hydroxyl radical is of great
atmospheric importance due to the formation of secondary pollutants,
formaldehyde, and peroxyl radicals through further oxidation of C2H5O isomers. In this work, we investigated the
effect of water [(H2O)n (n = 1–2)] on the title reaction over the temperature
range of 216.7–425.0 K, from the perspective of both energy
profiles and kinetics using theoretical calculations. Our results
show that although the inclusion of water aids in building ring-like
configurations that stabilize prereactive complexes, transition states,
and postreactive complexes, the products are not changed. In all cases,
the hydrogen abstraction from the methylene group of ethanol by •OH to form CH3CHOH is predominantly preferred
over the formation of CH2CH2OH and CH3CH2O by methylic hydrogen abstraction and hydroxylic hydrogen
abstraction, respectively. However, water has different effects on
the energy barrier of three hydrogen extraction reactions. The energy
barrier for the formation of CH3CHOH is decreased by 1.4
and 1.0 kcal mol–1 in the mono- and dihydrated reaction,
respectively, whereas for the formation of CH3CH2O, the barrier height is increased by 1.4 and 1.9 kcal mol–1, respectively. However, there is no obvious effect of water on the
energy barrier for the formation of CH2CH2OH.

The temperature-dependent rate coefficient of bared reaction and
effective rate coefficient of hydrated reaction were investigated
using the harmonic transition-state theory over the temperature range
of 216.7–425.0 K. The rate coefficients for the formation of
CH2CH2OH, CH3CH2O, and
CH3CHOH at 298.2 K are calculated to be 5.2 × 10–13, 8.6 × 10–14, and 9.0 ×
10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, respectively. By considering •OH···H2O + CH3CH2OH as the main entrance channel in monohydrated reaction, our results
show that depending on the hydrogen position on ethanol, the presence
of a single water molecule slows down the hydrogen abstraction by
3–5 orders of magnitude. The branching ratios of CH2CH2OH, CH3CH2O, and CH3CHOH are almost insensitive to the presence of one water molecule.
For the reaction involving the water dimer, which mainly proceeds
through the CH3CH2OH···H2O···H2O + •OH
channel, the effective rate coefficients are 6–8 orders of
magnitude lower than the rate coefficients of corresponding water-free
reactions. The water dimer is estimated to reduce the CH3CHOH branching ratio by ∼2% over the temperature range of
216.7–298.2 K, whereas the branching ratio of CH2CH2OH has risen by around 2%. Overall, the estimated energetic
and kinetic characterization of (H2O)n (n = 1–2) in the title reaction would
facilitate the understanding of the fate of ethanol and the secondary
pollutants derived from it. The current results are also important
for further understanding of atmospheric models to predict the concentration
of relevant atmospheric pollutants.

4 Computational
Method
All the quantum chemical calculations have been carried
out with
the Gaussian 09 program package.54 The
optimization and characterization of all stationary points on PES
were performed using the Becke-half-and-half-Lee–Yang–Parr
(BH&HLYP) hybrid density functional with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis
set.55,56 For the purpose of delineating the nature
(minima or saddle points) of the stationary points on the PES, providing
ZPE and thermal correction to enthalpy and Gibbs free energy, we also
calculated the harmonic vibrational frequencies at the same level
of theory. Scaling factors were not used on harmonic vibrational frequencies
because they are usually derived for specific systems and may lead
to erroneous results when applied to other systems.57 The effect of anharmonicity on di- and higher hydrates
is notable and would result in improved thermochemistry of the systems
at hand.58,59 Unfortunately, the determination of accurate
force fields is sufficiently difficult by the spectral method or theoretical
method and the construction of reliable scaling factors has been shown
to be difficult even for small systems.58,60 Besides, given
the high computational cost of anharmonic vibrational frequency calculations,
anharmonicity was not considered in this study. The spin contamination
often arises from unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
and it is not guaranteed that the electronic states from these calculations
are eigenstates of the Ŝ2 operator.
For our calculations, it was found to be negligible for all electronic
states, ranging between 0.003 and 0.018.

Moreover, we carried
out intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations
to guarantee that the transition-state structures with only one imaginary
frequency obtained from frequency calculations perfectly connected
the reactants to the desired products.61,62 The BH&HLYP
functional has been widely applied to illustrate hydrogen abstraction
mechanisms in molecule–radical reactions, and the theoretically
predicted rate coefficients and branching ratios exhibited reasonable
agreement with experiments.25,40,63 Because the treatment of electron correlation is critical to obtaining
more compatible reaction energy, coupled to the high sensitivity of
the kinetic calculations to the activation energy, the final energies
were obtained by performing more accurate CCSD(T) single-point energy
calculations on the BH&HLYP/aug-cc-pVTZ method-optimized structures.64

The temperature-dependent rate coefficients
and branching ratios
both in the absence and in the presence of water were calculated using
the energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//BH&HLYP/aug-cc-pVTZ
level of theory based on harmonic transition-state theory.65,66 Taking the bared reaction as the model reaction to determine the
kinetics, the following two elementary steps have been considered 13   14  

A similar procedure is valid
for the
reaction in the presence of
water. The first step is the reversible and barrierless formation
of a prereactive complex (CR) that is assumed to be in equilibrium
with the reactants. k1 and k–1 denotes the collision rate coefficient of reactants
and evaporation rate coefficient of CR, respectively. The second step
is the irreversible hydrogen abstraction of ethanol by the hydroxyl
radical, where k2 represents the rate
coefficient of the reaction from CR to the corresponding products.
Using harmonic transition-state theory, the temperature-dependent
reaction rate coefficient k2 can be calculated
as 15  where vTS are
the harmonic frequencies (the imaginary frequency is omitted) for
the transition state and vreact are the
harmonic frequencies for CR, Ea is the
energy separating the prereactive complex and transition state, R is molar gas coefficient, and T is the
absolute temperature.

According to the approximation that the
prereactive complexes are
on pseudo-steady state conditions, the overall reaction rate coefficient k can be expressed as67 16  

Noting that
the entropy change in k–1 for transforming
the prereactive complex into the original reactants
is fairly larger than that in k2 for the
formation of products,68,69 one can expect that k–1 is much larger than k2, so that k–1 + k2 ≈ k–1. The
equilibrium coefficient (keq) for the
formation of the prereactive complex is expressed as 17  where ρ0 is the standard
density and ΔG is Gibbs free energy change
when forming the prereactive complex from the reactants. Equation 16 can then be rewritten
as 18
