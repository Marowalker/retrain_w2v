It
is very important to improve the cyclone separator separation
efficiency for fine particles. On the basis of the Reynolds stress
model (RSM), a new two-stage cyclone separation device is modeled
and the model is simulated under six kinds of air volumetric flow
rate conditions. The two-stage cyclone separator was then tested in
the laboratory and the experimental data were compared with the simulation
data. The results show that the RSM model can predict the performance
of the two-stage cyclone separation device with high accuracy. Increasing
of the air volumetric flow rate can not only improve the separation
efficiency of the two-stage cyclone separator, but also effectively
change the classification range. Because of the centrifugal force,
even if the pressure drop is low, the 1st-cyclone can completely separate
particles above 5.0 μm. When the air volumetric flow rate is
more than 290 m3/h, the 2nd-cyclone can effectively separate
the particles below 2.0 μm. The study also confirmed the nonlinear
relationship between the pressure drop and the cut-off particle size
and the maximum particle size. When the pressure drop exceeds a certain
value, there is no longer any effect on the cut-off particle size
and the maximum particle size.

1 Introduction
Because of their convenient
operation and relatively low operating
costs, cyclones are widely used in the chemical industry, food engineering,
and environmental engineering.1,2 The principle of a cyclone
separator is to use different centrifugal forces of particles with
different particle sizes to classify particles. However, the cyclone
separator also has its disadvantages. For particles below 5 μm,
the separation efficiency is often very low.3,4

As Morse’s first conical cyclone was introduced in 1886,
scientists have conducted a variety of studies on cyclones to improve
their performance. The main research methods of cyclones include:
(1) experimental analysis; (2) theoretical empirical formula; (3)
statistical analysis; and (4) numerical computation of computational
fluid dynamics (CFD).5−7 Although each method can realize the design and optimization
of cyclones, the numerical simulation method of CFD has more obvious
advantages. It not only can quickly change parameters, but also can
express air flow field and trajectory more intuitively, and has stronger
visibility.

Separation efficiency and pressure drop are two
important performance
indicators of cyclone separators. The scientists used CFD to conduct
a large number of numerical simulations on cyclone separators and
compared them with experimental values.7−12 Many important conclusions have been obtained. Some scientists have
used algorithms to optimize cyclone parameters to obtain the best
parameters for the separator.13−15 Some scientists use electric
and magnetic fields to improve the separation efficiency of cyclones.16,17 However, changing the cyclone separator structure is the most important
way to optimize the performance of the cyclone separator.

Hosokawa
Micron Group is one of the world’s leading suppliers
of powder-processing equipment. It has the most extensive experience
and cutting-edge powder-processing technology. However, the separation
range of the two-wheel classifier with the smallest particle size
is only 2–10 μm. There is no corresponding equipment
for particle grading requirements below 2 μm.

In this
work, a two-stage cyclone separator was designed, consisting
of a 1st-cyclone and a 2nd-cyclone. This development is impressive
because of its compact design. The 1st-cyclone has high separation
efficiency for large particles and can effectively reduce 2nd-cyclone
separation pressure. The 2nd-cyclone has high separation efficiency
for small particles and can effectively separate small particles.
Using a combination of experimental and numerical simulation methods,
it was found that the cyclone separator not only completely separates
particles larger than 5.0 μm, but also effectively separates
particles below 2.0 μm.

2 Numerical Simulation
2.1 Mathematical Model
The main methods for simulating the continuous phase
of the cyclone separator are renormalized group (RNG k-ε), differential
stress model, large eddy simulation, and Reynolds stress model (RSM).
According to a comprehensive comparison of these methods, RSM is the
most elaborate type of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence
model that ANSYS Fluent provides.18 Abandoning
the isotropic eddy-viscosity hypothesis, the RSM closes the Reynolds-averaged
Navier–Stokes equations by solving transport equations for
the Reynolds stresses, together with an equation for the dissipation
rate. This means that five additional transport equations are required
in two-dimensional flows, in comparison to seven additional transport
equations solved in three-dimensional flows.19

As the RSM accounts for the effects of streamline curvature,
swirl, rotation, and rapid changes in strain rate in a more rigorous
manner than one-equation and two-equation models, it has greater potential
to give accurate predictions for complex flows. This article uses
RSM for continuous phase simulation. The mathematical models are shown
below. 1  

Among them, i, j, and k are the three
directions in the Cartesian coordinate system. Dij, φij, Gij, εij, S are the proliferation
term, the pressure–strain term, the production term, the dissipation
term, respectively. ui, uj, and uk represent the speed fluctuation.

The volume of particles in the cyclone is small, and its volume
fraction is much less than 10%, so it can be considered that it does
not affect the air flow. The discrete phase model (DPM) belongs to
the Euler–Lagrange model. The continuous phase is described
by the Euler method, and the discrete phase is described by the Lagrange
method. Turbulence was emulated for particles by using the random
walk model. The mathematical models are shown below.20 2  where up is the
velocity of the particle; u stands for the velocity
of the continuous phase; ρp denotes the density of
the particle; ρ stands for the density of the continuous phase; gx denotes the acceleration of gravity; FD is the particle resistance; and Fx represents the other force.

2.2 Physical
Model
The two-stage cyclone
separator consists of a 1st-cyclone and a 2nd-cyclone. The 2nd-cyclone
has two inlets and can reduce the low pressure drop without affecting
the performance of the cyclone separation. The cyclone system base
plate can be disassembled. It is convenient to clean after each experiment.
The two-stage cyclone geometry model and its parameter dimensions
are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Two-stage cyclone geometry model and parameters.

2.3 Boundary Condition Settings
In order
to save computing resources and shorten the calculation time, the
following hypotheses are made for the numerical simulation conditions:
(1) the temperature field is constant; (2) the fluid is not compressible;
and (3) the flow within the area is completely disordered. The parameters
of the particles are completely set according to the experimental
results. According to the actual conditions of the experimental device,
the boundary conditions are set as shown in Table 1.

2.4 Grid Independence Study
The model
was meshed using ANSYS Meshing 17.0. Four grids were used for the
grid independence study. Element quality, skewness, orthogonal quality,
and y+ were used to evaluate the mesh
quality, as shown in Table 2. The element quality option provides a composite quality
metric that ranges between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect
cube or square, whereas a value of 0 indicates that the element has
a zero or negative volume. According to the definition of skewness,
a value of 0 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 1
indicates a completely degenerate cell (worst). The range for orthogonal
quality is 0–1, where a value of 0 is worst and a value of
1 is best.19 As the boundary layer thickness
is usually quite small within the cyclone body because of high swirling
flow, no inflation layers were created in meshes and therefore the
boundary layer structure was not fully resolved.21 For the RSM model, it is appropriate when y+ is around 30.19

Table 2 Characteristics of the Grids
mesh characteristic	mesh 1	mesh 2	mesh 3	mesh 4	
nodes	41 257	46 965	157 003	203 841	
elements	229 913	558 714	805 560	1 241 460	
element quality (average)	0.81	0.86	0.88	0.88	
skewness (average)	0.28	0.21	0.18	0.17	
orthogonal quality
(average)	0.82	0.88	0.90	0.90	
y+	48.45	37.62	29.81	27.18	
As can be seen from Table 2, when the number of elements
is smaller than 805 560, the
grid quality increases as the number of elements increases. When the
number of elements is larger than 805 560, the grid quality does not
increase significantly as the number of elements increases. The simulation
results also show that when the number of elements is larger than
805 560, the accuracy of simulation results no longer increases with
the number of elements. To save computing resources, select mesh 3
as the final mesh.

3 Experimental Materials and
Methods
3.1 Materials
Talcum powder is common
and can be controlled within 20 μm as needed. Therefore, talcum
powder with a density of 2800 kg/m3 was selected as the
feed particles. Although the particle dispersion state may be slightly
different under different air volumetric flow rates, these differences
are small and can be ignored because no particles were clogged in
the dispersing device even under a low air volumetric flow rate. The
particle size distribution of the talcum powder was measured using
an AeroTrak TSI 9306-V laser particle counter. The results are shown
in Figure 2. As can
be seen from Figure 2, the feed particles conform to the Rosin-Rammler distribution and
most of the particle sizes are below 10 μm.

Figure 2 Talcum powder particle
size distribution.

The Rosin-Rammler distribution
function is shown below.19 3  where k represents the shape
parameter; f represents the proportional parameter.

The talcum particle size distribution data were imported into Origin
and data fitting was performed. The formula for the particle size
distribution is as follows: R2 is 0.98. 4  

The shape parameter of the inlet particle size distribution
is
2.42, and the proportional parameter is 1.73. That is, the inlet particle
spread parameter is 2.42, and the median diameter (also called cut-off
diameter) is 1.73 μm.

3.2 Experimental Devices and
Methods
In order to study the effect of inlet air volumetric
flow rate on
the performance of two-stage cyclones, a microdust collector model
was developed. The microdust collector consists of three systems:
a two-stage cyclone separation system, a filtration system, and a
fan system. The fan system can provide power. The filtration system
is to prevent the talcum powder that has not been separated during
the experiment from escaping and causing pollution. As the pressure
drop measuring devices and methods of the two inlets of the 2nd-cyclone
are the same, only one of the inlet pressure drop measuring devices
is drawn. The experimental device installation is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Experimental device.

Air flow is generated by the fan
system. The fan is an adjustable
fan and the air volumetric flow rate ranges from 0 to 360 m3/h. Make sure that the inlet particle concentration is 1040 mg/m3 and adjust the air volumetric flow rate of the fan. Experiments
were conducted at an air volumetric flow rate of 85, 120, 177, 226,
290, and 332 m3/h. At least five sets of experiments were
conducted for each air volumetric flow rate. The experimental time
for each group was 2 min. To ensure the accuracy of the experiment,
clean the cyclone system and the filtration system after each experiment.

The particle concentration on the outlet of the two-stage cyclone
was measured by CEL-712 Microdust Pro. The instrument is produced
by the American company Casella with an accuracy of 0.001 mg/m3. The pressure drop is measured by an inclined differential
pressure gauge.

4 Experimental Verification
4.1 Pressure Drop
Pressure drop is one
of the important indexes of the performance of cyclone separators.
It is mainly caused by the friction between the fluid and the wall
and the internal vortex flow.5 As the mass
loading of particles will affect the pressure drop, all pressure drops
are measured with particle loading. The 2nd-cyclone has two inlets.
The experiment found that the two inlet pressures are basically equal.
However, for the accuracy of the experiment, the actual 2nd-cyclone
inlet pressure is the average of the two inlet pressures of the 2nd-cyclone.
The obtained 1st-cyclone pressure drop, 2nd-cyclone pressure drop,
and total pressure drop were compared with the simulation results.
The result is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Pressure drop comparison.

From Figure 4, it
is observed that the 1st-cyclone pressure drop, the 2nd-cyclone pressure
drop, and the total pressure drop increased with the increase of air
volumetric flow rate, which is consistent with the results of other
scholars.22−25 The 1st-cyclone has only a cylindrical portion and does not have
a cone portion. This results in a smaller 1st-cyclone vortex and lower
pressure drop. When the air volumetric flow rate is 332 m3/h, the pressure drop is only one-tenth of the 2nd-cyclone.

The 2nd-cyclone volume is small, and the inlet air speed is much
larger than that of the 2nd-cyclone. This leads to more intense internal
eddy currents and more energy loss. Therefore, the 2nd-cyclone pressure
drop is the main component of the total pressure drop.15 There is a certain error between the experimental
value and the simulation result. It is mainly due to the presence
of swirling flow at the 2nd-cyclone inlet, which makes it difficult
to measure the pressure. In order to obtain the pressure at the 2nd-cyclone
inlet, no less than 10 measurements were taken and averaged as a result.
Error bars represent standard errors.

In general, the experimental
value of pressure drop is larger than
the simulation value. The reason for this phenomenon may be that due
to the smaller outlet pipe, the pitot tube occupies a certain volume
in the pipe, making the air speed at the outlet of the pipe larger,
resulting in greater total outlet pressure, so that the pressure drop
experimental value is greater than the simulation value. However,
the experimental results of pressure drop under different air volumetric
flow rate conditions are consistent with the overall trend of the
simulation results, and the relative errors are all within 5%, indicating
that the simulation results are reliable.

4.2 Separation
Efficiency
Figure 5 shows the relationship between
separation efficiency and air volumetric flow rate in a two-stage
cyclone separator (the error bars represent standard errors). It can
be seen that the simulated and measured values of 1st-cyclone separation
have been increasing with the increase of air volumetric flow rate.
The main reason is that there is no cone section in the 1st-cyclone,
and it is mainly separated by the cylinder section. Even at the maximum
air volumetric flow rate condition, the inlet air speed does not reach
the 1st-cyclone critical air speed.

Figure 5 Separation efficiency comparison.

The simulated and measured values
of the 2nd-cyclone efficiency
and total efficiency increase first with the increase of air volumetric
flow rate, and then tend to be stable. At the time of stabilizing,
the air volumetric flow rate was 226 m3/h, and the 2nd-cyclone
inlet air speed was 20.37 m/s. This air speed is called the maximum
efficiency inlet speed.23,26 As the 2nd-cyclone
volume is small and the air speed is large, the pressure drop is the
main part of the two-stage cyclone. Correspondingly, the 2nd-cyclone
separation efficiency is also the main part of the two-stage cyclone.

Although the experimental value of the pressure drop is larger
than the simulation value, the experimental value of the separation
efficiency is smaller than the simulation value. The main reason may
be that the particles deposited on the base plate during the experiment
are re-entrained in both the 1st-cyclone and the 2nd-cyclone, resulting
in a large fluctuation in the 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency (as
can be seen from the error bars). As a result, the experimental value
of 1st-cyclone and 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency is small. However,
with the increase of air volumetric flow rate, the variation of simulation
value and experimental value of separation efficiency is basically
the same, and the relative error is within 10%, indicating that the
simulation results can predict the experimental results well.

5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Particle Trajectory of
Different Particle
Sizes
Figure 6 shows several typical particle transport trajectories of different
particle sizes at an air volumetric flow rate of 226 m3/h. It can be seen that the particles below 5.0 μm are mostly
rotated from the inlet to the bottom along the inner surface of the
1st-cyclone. Then, it is rotated from the bottom to the 2nd-cyclone.
After entering the 2nd-cyclone, some particles were deposited on the
bottom of the 2nd-cyclone under the effect of centrifugal force, and
some particles were discharged from the outlet. We can also find an
interesting phenomenon. Part of the particles in the 0.5–1.0
μm range rotate directly into the 2nd-cyclone at the top of
the 1st-cyclone. It does not undergo the process of falling and then
rising within the 1st-cyclone.

Figure 6 Particle trajectory.

Particles above 5.0 μm have a large centrifugal force
because
of their large diameter. After entering the 1st-cyclone from the inlet,
some particles are deposited at the bottom of the 1st-cyclone and
another part rises inside the 1st-cyclone. However, because of the
large centrifugal force, the particles cannot reach the 2nd-cyclone
inlets. The collection efficiency of large particles is significantly
improved.

5.2 Body Concentration Distribution with Different
Air Volumetric Flow Rates
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the two-stage
cyclone concentration under different air volumetric flow rate conditions.
It can be seen that as the air volumetric flow rate increases, the
air speed at the 1st-cyclone inlet increases. The concentration of
spiral particles and the concentration of sediment particles on the
outer ring of the floor gradually increased. It shows that the 1st-cyclone
separation efficiency increases gradually, which is consistent with
the experimental results. However, the particle concentration of the
2nd-cyclone hopper does not gradually increase when the air volumetric
flow rate increases. When the air volumetric flow rate increased from
85 to 177 m3/h, the particle concentration of the 2nd-cyclone
hopper increased with the increase of air volumetric flow rate. When
the air volumetric flow rate increased from 177 to 332 m3/h, the particle concentration of the 2nd-cyclone hopper first decreased
and then increased. The reason for this is that as the air volumetric
flow rate increases, the efficiency of the 1st-cyclone separation
increases, and the number of particles entering the 2nd-cyclone decreases.
Even if the 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency increases with the increase
of the air volumetric flow rate, because of the decrease of the particle
amount, the concentration of the 2nd-cyclone hopper particle decreases.

Figure 7 Two-stage
cyclone concentration distribution.

When the air volumetric flow rate is 226 m3/h,
the particle
deposition on the inner wall of the 1st-cyclone cylinder is shown
in Figure 8a, and the
particle deposition on the two-stage cyclone base plate is shown in Figure 8b. Although talcum
powder is lubricious and extremely unstable, a spiral particle deposition
zone is formed on the inner wall of the 1st-cyclone cylinder. It strongly
shows the phenomenon of particle clustering during particle separation
similar to the results observed in the literature and the simulation
results.27−31 The particle deposition area formed around the two-stage cyclone
base plate and the particle deposition area formed by the bottom plate
center hopper are also similar to the simulation results.

Figure 8 Experimental
particle deposition: (a) the inner wall of the 1st-cyclone
cylinder; (b) base plate.

5.3 Effect of Air Volumetric Flow Rate on Classification
Efficiency
Figure 9 shows the classification efficiency of 1st-cyclone, 2nd-cyclone,
and two-stage cyclone under different air volumetric flow rate conditions.
It can be seen from the figure that when the inlet air volumetric
flow rate is small, the efficiency of the 1st-cyclone and 2nd-cyclone
is very low for particles smaller than 2 μm. With the increase
of air volumetric flow rate, the efficiency of 1st-cyclone separation
did not change significantly for particles below 2.0 μm, and
it was basically stable at about 60%. For particles below 2.0 μm,
the 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency is significantly increased.
When the air volumetric flow rate is more than 290 m3/h,
the 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency is basically above 90% for particles
below 2.0 μm. That is to say, when the air volumetric flow rate
is more than 290 m3/h, the two-stage cyclone separator
can effectively separate particles with 2.0 μm or less.

Figure 9 Effect of air
volumetric flow rate on classification efficiency:
(a) Q = 85; (b) Q = 120; (c) Q = 177; (d) Q = 226; (e) Q = 290; (f) Q = 332.

By contrast, a strange phenomenon can be found. The 2nd-cyclone
has a low particle separation efficiency of about 1.0 μm, and
some even have a lower separation efficiency than 0.3 μm particles.
This strange phenomenon is known as “fish-hook” phenomenon.32 As the inlet air volumetric flow rate increases,
the “fish-hook” is no longer so prominent, consistent
with the results of the Kilavuz and Gülsoy studies.33 The reason for this may be related to the particle
migration trajectory mentioned earlier, and further research is needed.
Particles in the 0.5–1.0 μm range are directly dragged
to the vortex finder, resulting in reduced efficiency.8 When the air volumetric flow rate is greater than 120 m3/h, the 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency is above 70% for
all particle sizes.

5.4 Influence of Pressure Drop
on Cut-Off Diameter
and Maximum Diameter
The cut-off size is defined as the diameter
at which 50% of the particles are separated and the maximum size is
defined as the diameter of the largest particle that is captured. Figure 10 shows the relationship
between the cut-off particle size, the maximum particle size, and
the total pressure drop. It can be seen that even with a minimum pressure
drop of 650 Pa, the maximum size of the 2nd-cyclone is 2.03 μm.
However, because of the low efficiency of 2nd-cyclone separation for
particles below 2.0 μm at this time, it cannot completely satisfy
the grading requirements for particles below 2.0 μm.

Figure 10 Effect of
pressure drop on cut-off particle size and maximum particle
size: (a) cut-off particle size; (b) maximum particle size.

As expected, the 1st-cyclone and
2nd-cyclone cut-off particle size
and maximum particle size decrease with the increase of pressure drop.
The cut-off diameter is mainly related to the cyclone circulation
in the body. The larger the swirling flow, the greater the centrifugal
force on the particles. Correspondingly, the dust removal efficiency
becomes higher and the cut-off particle size becomes smaller. The
conclusions of the study are consistent with those of Liu.34 As mentioned above, when the air volumetric
flow rate is greater than 290 m3/h, the 2nd-cyclone particle
separation efficiency below 2.0 μm is more than 90%, and the
pressure drop at this time is 8182 Pa. When the pressure drop is less
than 8182 Pa, the 1st-cyclone and 2nd-cyclone cut-off particle size
and maximum particle size decrease with the increase of pressure drop.
Then, with continued increase in the pressure drop, the cut-off particle
size and maximum particle size of the 2nd-cyclone basically no longer
change.

6 Conclusions
This
paper mainly studies the effect of air volumetric flow rate
on the performance of two-stage cyclone separation. Comparing the
experimental value with the simulated value, the pressure drop error
is within 5%, and the efficiency error is within 10%. It shows that
the simulation results can well predict the performance of two-stage
cyclone separation.

For the two-stage cyclone separator, the
1st-cyclone can increase
the collection efficiency of the large particles, and the 2nd-cyclone
can increase the collection efficiency of the small particles. When
the air volumetric flow rate is more than 177 m3/h, the
collection efficiency of the particles above 5.0 μm is 100%.
The 2nd-cyclone can increase the collection efficiency of small particles.
When the air volumetric flow rate is greater than 177 m3/h, the collection efficiency of all particle sizes is greater than
75%. When the air volumetric flow rate is more than 290 m3/h, the 2nd-cyclone separation efficiency is basically above 90%
for particles below 2.0 μm.

Further, on observing the
relationship between the pressure drop
and the cut-off diameter and the maximum diameter, it is found that
the cut-off diameter and the maximum diameter are affected when the
pressure drop is within a certain range. With the increase of air
volumetric flow rate, the 1st-cyclone cut-off diameter ranges from
1.53 to 1.26 μm, the maximum diameter range from 7.11 to 3.21
μm, the 2nd-cyclone cut-off diameter from 1.00 to 0.63 μm,
and the maximum diameter range from 2.03 to 1.07 μm.

The
inadequacy of this study is that the pressure drop is high
and the cut-off particle size is limited to 0.63 μm. With continued
increase in the pressure drop, the cut-off particle size cannot continue
to decrease. The next step is to adjust the inlet size and the air
speed ratio so as to reduce the pressure drop, increase the separation
efficiency, and reduce the cut-off diameter.
