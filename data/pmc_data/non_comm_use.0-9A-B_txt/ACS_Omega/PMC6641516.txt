A conductive coating
of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Nafion dispersion
in water was deposited on a Nafion membrane via air-controlled electrospray.
When the coated membrane was assembled into a large single cell of
a vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) with a surface area of 35 cm2, it was found that its cycling performance was greatly enhanced
at much higher current densities than was afforded by the pristine
Nafion membrane. A masking technique was also applied during the electrospraying
process to create alternating domains of coated and uncoated membrane
surfaces, which helped to mitigate the restriction of proton transport
through the membrane due to the coating, while still decreasing the
surface resistivity and thus the interfacial resistance of the membrane.
Our results reveal that a very small mass of CNTs (∼0.015 mg
CNT/cm2) enabled large improvements in the capacity retention
and voltaic efficiencies of the vanadium redox battery during charging
and discharging. This method has shown to be a reasonably fast, simple,
and scalable technique for improving rate capability of VRBs, with
the potential for extension to other redox flow battery systems.

1 Introduction
Global electricity production
from renewable sources has grown
dramatically in recent years.1,2 While this new production
ultimately drives energy generation portfolios toward a lower dependence
on carbon-based electricity, the intermittent nature of renewable
forms of electricity generation has proven difficult to incorporate
into regional electrical grids. Grid-scale electricity storage methods
are a promising solution to the inefficiencies associated with unpredictable
electricity generation. Redox flow batteries have demonstrated the
ability to be used as a reasonably low-cost, long-term electrical
storage method. Specifically, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs)
have been of special interest because of their chemical stability,
long life cyclability, and potential for high electrical capacity.3−5 VRBs take advantage of the four adjacent oxidation states of vanadium
for the transfer of electrons via a redox reaction. The positive half-cell
contains VO2+ which can be oxidized to VO2+ during charging; the negative half-cell contains V3+ which can be reduced to V2+ during charging. The vanadium
salts are typically dissolved in sulfuric acid. Accompanying these
advantages are some research challenges. There have been a number
of efforts to improve the electrical conductivity of VRBs by physically
or chemically altering the electrodes of the cell. Most VRBs use a
carbon or graphite felt as porous cathodes and anodes—the large
surface area from the felt is used to increase the number of reaction
sites at which the redox reaction can occur. Many modifications to
the electrodes have been investigated, including using various highly
conductive carbons,6−16 metal catalysts,17−19 and doping the carbon felt with hydrophilic surface
groups.20−23 Some works on casting membranes with conductive carbons incorporated
into the bulk of the membrane have also been explored, typically focusing
on graphene oxide or graphite as the carbon source.24−28 Substantial work has focused on selection and pretreatment
methods for the Nafion family of membranes in VRBs.29−32 To our knowledge, little work
has been conducted investigating the application of conductive carbons
to the surface of premade membranes themselves. While other membrane
modification techniques involve poorly scalable casting or pretreatment
techniques, our goal was to create a fast and inexpensive process
to improve VRB performance. To this end, a new approach to improve
the rate capability of VRBs involves increasing the electrical conductivity
of the membrane itself using the electrospray deposition of conductive
carbon mixed with a binder directly onto the membrane. In this method,
a very small amount of highly conductive carbon can be deposited directly
onto the surface of the cation exchange membrane, thereby increasing
the electrical conductivity near the surface of the membrane without
impeding proton transport through the membrane. This technique was
investigated for use as both a stand-alone pretreatment of VRB membranes
and as a complementary feature to existing electrode modifications.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of the Conductive
Ink
The conductive ink consisted of three primary components—multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (CNTs, Sigma), 20 wt % Nafion Dispersion (Ion Power,
Newcastle, DE), and DI water. The CNTs add a highly conductive component
to the spray, which improves the electrical conductivity across the
surface of the membrane. The Nafion dispersion acted as a binder for
the CNTs and the Nafion 117 membrane (Ion Power, Newcastle, DE) and
was also a good surfactant when mixing the CNTs in water. The ink
composition was important to both improve the rate capability of the
battery and to allow for good processability when electrospraying.
An ideal spray condition is realized when the conductive ink is able
to be electrosprayed in a well-dispersed manner while hitting the
membrane without complete solvent evaporation. This allows time for
the remaining solvent to evaporate while the Nafion dispersion has
a chance to relax and form a thin film. It was found that ink compositions
with high water content would result in the spray collecting as a
dry powder, which could be easily removed with abrasion. Some ink
compositions with too much Nafion dispersion added would result in
the spray not drying fast enough on the membrane, causing uneven distribution
and dripping of the carbon ink down the substrate membrane. It was
found that a carbon ink composition of 0.5 wt % CNTs, 15.0 wt % Nafion
dispersion (20 wt % polymer), and 84.5 wt % DI water created a carbon
ink with both good processability and performance. The coating after
spraying was assumed to have no residual water, leading to a coating
composition of about 14 wt % CNTs and 86 wt % Nafion polymer.

2.2 Processing Conditions
The carbon
ink was ultrasonicated for 1 h before use. The solution was placed
in a 5 mL syringe and sprayed through a homemade coaxial needle (tube
gauge of 10 and shell gauge of 17) using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus).
Dry air was applied through the shell of the coaxial needle at 10
psig. The use of air-controlled electrospraying helped increase the
rate of spraying, as has been demonstrated elsewhere (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic of the air-controlled
electrospraying process for creating
conductive coatings.

The Nafion 117 membrane (dry) was placed on a grounded copper
current
collector at a distance of 18 cm from the tip of the needle. A positive
lead was attached to the needle, and the voltage was set to 18 kV.
It was found that a flow rate of 0.05 mL/min was appropriate to balance
deposition and solvent evaporation rates. The membranes seem to perform
best when they were not completely covered by the carbon spray, so
a copper mesh was used as a mask during spraying. The mesh had a series
of 1 mm square holes, which allowed spraying through to hit the Nafion
117 membrane. Spray that did not go through the holes was stopped
by the mask, creating a uniformly patterned series of domains with
and without the carbon ink spray. Both sides of each membrane were
sprayed in every case. Spray loadings of 0.015 mg CNT/cm2, 0.035 mg CNT/cm2, and 0.070 mg CNT/cm2 per
side were tested.

2.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
spray-coated membranes were tested using in situ electrical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) testing to measure the changes in resistance in
the cell with the inclusion of the conductive membrane coating. An
electrolyte consisting of 4 M H2SO4 and 1 M
VOSO4 was used for all testing. An ac voltage of 1 mV amplitude
was used over a frequency range of 104 to 10–3 Hz to generate Nyquist plots of the pristine and coated membranes.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at rates of 20, 50, and 100
mV/s in a three-electrode glass cell using the abovementioned electrolyte.
The reference electrode used was Ag/AgCl, and the counter electrode
used was a platinum wire. A 3.0 mm diameter circle of polished glassy
carbon electrode (GCE) was coated with both the conductive coating
and the Nafion dispersion alone to observe the difference in electrochemical
activity at the membrane. A potential range between −0.85 and
1.5 V was explored. Four-point probe surface conductivity tests were
also used to determine changes in surface electrical resistance with
and without membrane coatings and with and without the use of a mesh
mask. This involved pressing four parallel metal probes on the surface
of the coated and uncoated membranes several times in various places
on the membrane to get measurements of resistivity to electron flow
between the probes. A current is passed between the outer two probes,
and a corresponding voltage is measured between the inner two probes.

2.4 Diffusion Tests
A 2-chamber side-by-side
diffusion cell (Permegear) was used to measure the diffusivity of
both vanadium ions and hydrogen ions across the Nafion 117 membrane.
Vanadium diffusion rates were measured by placing 3.4 mL of 1 M VOSO4 in 4 M H2SO4 in the donor chamber of
the diffusion cell and 3.4 mL of 1 M MgSO4 in 4 M H2SO4 in the receptor chamber of the cell. MgSO4 was added to balance the contribution of osmotic pressure
from the added vanadium salt that could impact the perceived diffusion
rate. Samples (200 μL) of the receptor chamber were taken at
periodic time intervals as the V(IV) ions diffused across the membrane
and were replaced with fresh receptor solution. These samples were
analyzed using UV–visible spectroscopy to determine the increase
in the concentration of V(IV) over time.

2.5 Single-Cell
Testing
Membrane coatings
were assessed using single-cell testing in an in-house flow cell system.
Included in the system were two glass chambers for electrolyte storage,
from which electrolyte was pumped through 1/4″ i.d. tubing
to and from the flow cell (Tygon 2375 Ultra tubing, Watson-Marlow
323E Pump). Each side of the cell consisted of symmetric acrylic end
plates with push-to-connect tube fittings, a graphite current collector,
a Viton gasket, a polypropylene flow frame, and an HDPE gasket. These
parts were separated by a Nafion 117 membrane with or without a coating.
The total exposed area of the membrane and the graphite current collector
was a 7 cm by 5 cm rectangle, totaling 35 cm2. Each side
of the cell had a 2 mm space between the membrane and the current
collector, in which a piece of 3 mm thick porous graphite felt (PAN-based,
AVCarb) was compressed for good electrical contact. The felt was used
as received and was not pretreated in any way. The electrolyte used
in all tests was 1 M VOSO4 (Alfa Aesar) in 4 M H2SO4. This was prepared by first dissolving the appropriate
mass of VOSO4 into 4 M H2SO4. This
solution, containing V(IV), was then electrochemically oxidized while
being pumped through the flow cell. This was accomplished by using
a constant current charge of 15 mA/cm2 and an upper cutoff
voltage of 1.7 V. This cycle was repeated 5 times to ensure maximum
conversion to V(V) in the cathode and V(III) in the anode. The V(V)
was then removed from the system and replaced with more of the original
V(IV) solution, and the process was repeated. This generated more
V(V) at the cathode and V(II) at the anode. The single-cell tests
were then run using these freshly generated electrolyte solutions.
The electrolyte volume used was 25 mL for the catholyte and anolyte,
with a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Current densities between 30 and 50
mA/cm2 were explored. All single-cell cycling testings
were carried out using a battery analyzer (3 A/5 V, MTI). Cycling
involved charging and discharging repeatedly at a specified constant
current density. The upper cutoff voltage was set at 1.7 V and the
lower cutoff voltage was set at 0.8 V. Cycling tests were assessed
by Coulombic efficiency, voltaic efficiency, energy efficiency, and
capacity retention.

3 Results and Discussion
The coated membranes and the coating itself were thoroughly analyzed
to investigate the impact of the coating on electrochemical activity
and overall performance of the battery.

3.1 Optical
Analysis
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the surface of the membrane (Figure 2). The thickness
and homogeneity of the coating were considered as important aspects
regarding the reproducibility of membrane coatings using these methods.
Both surface and cross-section imaging was conducted. It was found
that the carbon coatings were typically between 3 and 5 microns in
thickness. The coatings seemed to form discrete regions of CNT aggregates,
connected together with the Nafion dispersion binder. These regions
are likely formed because of the rapid evaporation of small amounts
of residual water left in the ink after it hits the surface of the
membrane. The coatings showed that the CNTs were predominantly encapsulated
in droplets of Nafion dispersion, providing anchoring sites that proved
to be resistant to delamination or degradation during cycling.

the coated membrane with use of the mesh.

3.2 Electrochemical Measurements
3.2.1 Cyclic Voltammetry
Three-probe
CV tests were conducted at different scan rates to measure the impact
of the conductive ink on the electrochemical activity of the vanadium
redox reaction in the catholyte. The conductive ink was used to coat
a GCE and was compared to a GCE coated with only the Nafion dispersion.
This test was run to compare the electrochemical activity of the coated
Nafion membrane and the pristine Nafion membrane. The standard reduction
potential of the oxidation of VO2+ to VO2+ (cathodic reaction) is about 1.00 V, whereas the standard
reduction potential of the reduction of V3+ to V2+ (anodic reaction) is about −0.26 V compared to the standard
hydrogen electrode. These two coatings were tested over a series of
potential scan rates, ranging from 20 to 100 mV/s (see Figure 3a,b). It was found that when
compared to the Nafion dispersion coating, the conductive ink peak
current increased during both the cathodic and anodic reactions. This
larger induced current is indicative of greater electrochemical activity
of both relevant vanadium redox reactions on the surface of the electrodes.
It should also be noted that no anodic peak was observed at both high
and low scan rates with the Nafion coating. This shows that the kinetics
of the anodic reaction are slow compared to those of the cathodic
reaction, as is consistent with other literature studies. A small
peak appears for the anodic reaction in the case of the conductive
ink, showing that the addition of CNTs helps facilitate the anodic
reaction. When current density is increased, the overpotential (peak
voltage difference from standard reduction potential) will typically
increase accordingly. When comparing a lower scan rate (20 mV/s) to
a higher scan rate (100 mV/s), the observed increase in the overpotential
for the electrode coated with a conductive ink is much lower than
the electrode coated with Nafion dispersion. This indicates the ability
of the CNT-based conductive ink to allow for a highly efficient redox
reaction, even at higher current densities.

CNT + Nafion-coated GCE at a (a) 20 mV/s
scan rate and a (b) 100 mV/s scan rate.

3.2.2 Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy
EIS testing was also conducted on the in-situ cell, probing the resistance
of the membranes with different coating thicknesses with and without
the use of a mesh mask. This test was used primarily to test if the
proton conductivity through the membrane was impacted with the use
of the coating. It was found that the proton conductivity, and hence
resistance contribution from the membrane, was nearly unchanged with
the addition of the conductive ink. There was a very low Ohmic resistance,
on the order of 0.1 ohms, as shown at the high frequency intercept
of the real axis in the Nyquist plots (Figure 4). When the conductive ink coating was applied
to the Nafion membrane, the charge transfer resistance did not change
noticeably. The charge transfer resistance was difficult to estimate
precisely in both the coated and pristine cases, as the system was
difficult to keep at a steady state in the slower, low frequency regime
of the test. It is likely that the charge transfer resistance was
effectively the same in both cases because of the fact that the majority
of the battery setup (electrodes and electrolyte) was unchanged during
these tests. Thus, any improvement in performance of the battery can
likely be attributed to the formation of a highly electrically conductive
network (CNTs) with tethered reaction sites (end groups of CNTs) focused
on the interface between the membrane and the felt electrodes. The
key message from these data is that despite the addition of a layer
of a conductive ink to the surface of the membrane, the observed resistance
to proton transport through the membrane was largely unhindered.

membrane coated with 0.10 mL of the conductive ink. The bottom plot
is a closer look at the high-frequency intercept shown in the top
plot.

3.2.3 Surface
Resistivity Measurements
Four-probe surface resistivity measurements
of each membrane were
also conducted to test the resistance to electron transport across
the surface of the membrane with different coating masses. The surface
resistivity of each membrane was measured and is shown in Figure 5. The addition of
the conductive ink at a deposition mass of ∼0.01 mg CNT/cm2 caused the electrical surface resistivity to decrease by
about half, when compared to the pristine Nafion membrane. The surface
resistivity decreased further when larger masses of the conductive
ink were added. Membranes coated without the mesh mask showed a slightly
lower resistivity than those coated with the mask. This was expected,
as there was a larger mass of conductive carbons reaching the membrane
in a continuous film, as compared to the discontinuous masked membrane.
The main results from these tests show that there is a noticeable
improvement in electrical conductivity across the surface of the membrane
with the addition of the coating, and a greater mass of coating leads
to lower electrical resistance across the surface. This is relevant
to the vanadium battery performance, as electrons can be effectively
transferred to the current collector when the vanadium redox reactions
occur, especially closer to the interface of the membrane and the
felt electrode. Ideally, the surface of the membrane would have a
very low electrical resistance, but this must be balanced with diffusive
restrictions of protons imposed by the addition of the coating.

measurements for differing amounts of added
CNTs with and without the use of a mesh mask.

3.3 Diffusion Testing
Membranes coated
with varying amounts of the conductive ink were assessed for ionic
permeability using diffusion testing. These tests used the diffusion
of vanadium(IV) ions through the membrane as an analogue for proton
diffusion through the membrane, as proton diffusion proved difficult
to be measured accurately because of the protonated nature of the
Nafion membrane. Figure 6 shows the change in the measured vanadium ion concentration in the
receptor chamber of the diffusion cell as a function of time. There
seemed to be some trend showing the reduction of vanadium ion crossover
with increased coating mass, although the relative differences are
quite small. This would support the theory that the regions of no
coating created when using the mesh mask allow for a combination of
reasonably fast ion transport through the membrane coupled with low
electrical resistance. Very little vanadium ion restriction was observed
when comparing either of the “0.015 mg CNT/cm2 mesh”
or “0.035 mg CNT/cm2 mesh” cases to the pristine
membrane case.

amounts

the inset.

3.4 Single-Cell
Tests
Each membrane was
assessed using a single-cell vanadium flow system. This cycling test
shows the true utility of any alteration to the VRB—the discharge
capacity and efficiencies must be maintained over a large number of
cycles, or the battery will face issues regarding potential longevity.
Each test consisted of 100 cycles in the voltage window of 0.8 to
1.7 V. Charge and discharge capacities were monitored over the cycling
period. Membranes were tested with varying masses of the conductive
ink sprayed on them to assess the impact of membrane thickness, mass
of CNTs, and ink surface coverage on VRB performance. First, the system
was tested with the pristine Nafion 117 membrane. It was found that
the membrane showed good capacity retention and cyclability at lower
current densities, around 30 mA/cm2 and lower. This changed
dramatically, however, when current densities were increased. As charge
and discharge current densities were increased to between 40 and 50
mA/cm2, discharge capacities dropped precipitously (see Figure 7). This is attributed
to the inability of the vanadium redox reaction to occur quickly enough—limited
by slow kinetics of the redox reaction from too few reaction sites
or high bulk resistance in the cell. Previous work has theorized that
the availability of hydroxyl groups attached to highly electrically
conductive material on the electrode can improve the reaction rate
of the redox couple based on reaction mechanisms proposed in the literature.6 This is also likely the case in this system.
Membranes sprayed with the conductive ink were tested at the same
current densities for the same number of cycles. Initial tests utilized
membranes sprayed with 2.5 mL of the conductive ink on each side of
the Nafion 117 membrane. The conductive ink contained 0.13 mg CNT/mL
solution. It was found that this led to poor performance of the VRB
over time, as the capacity was not retained after many cycles. The
capacity retention was diminished at a current density of 30 mA/cm2 when compared to the pristine Nafion case. It was theorized
that the thickness and relative hydrophobicity of this coating were
negatively impacting the ability of protons to transport easily through
the membrane, rapidly increasing cell polarization and diminishing
VRB capacity before the specified cutoff voltage was reached. To address
this issue, a twofold strategy was employed. First, the volume of
the ink sprayed was reduced to 0.50 mL per side to reduce the total
overall thickness of the coating. A copper mesh mask with a grid of
1 mm square holes was also placed over the membrane during the coating
process in an effort to generate ordered domains of coated and uncoated
regions on the surface of the membrane. This was to allow some discrete
domains to remain pristine and uncoated, while coating adjacent domains
with the conductive ink. The goal was to permit high proton transport,
while improving the electrical conductivity between the membrane and
the graphite felt. The results of these changes yielded improvements
in the capacity retention during cycling, especially at higher current
densities (see Figure 7). After this improvement, all tests on coated membranes were conducted
at the higher rate of 50 mA/cm2. The volume sprayed was
further reduced to approach a lower limit for improvements when reducing
CNT loading. Loadings of 0.070, 0.035, and 0.015 mg CNT/cm2 were tested at 50 mA/cm2 to see their effect on capacity
retention and battery performance (see Figure 8). As the spray volumes were reduced, a lower
volume of coating seemed to yield an improvement in initial discharge
capacity and capacity retention during cycling. Greater improvement
in discharge capacity retention was realized by further reducing spray
loadings from 0.035 to 0.015 mg/cm2. This seemed to indicate
that there is an important balance between the mass and topology of
the coating necessary to improve the overall capacity retention and
VRB performance. As the thickness of coating is reduced, proton transport
through the membrane likely approaches rates closer to that in the
pristine case (as was demonstrated in diffusion testing), while contributing
a highly electrically conductive bridge between the membrane and the
graphite felt. Single-cell tests were conducted wherein the same conductive
coating was electrosprayed onto the graphite felt instead of on the
membrane surface. This coated felt was paired with a pristine Nafion
membrane and tested in the VRB to see the impact of electrospraying
the conductive ink onto the membrane itself. It was found that even
when a loading of 0.15 mg CNT/cm2 of the conductive ink
was sprayed onto each piece of the graphite felt (ten times the volume
that was sprayed onto the best-performing membrane), the VRB single-cell
tests underperformed those using only 0.015 mg CNT/cm2 of
the conductive ink sprayed directly onto the membrane. This is likely
due to the Coulombic and voltaic efficiencies from each of these tests,
which are shown in Figure 9. The trends seen in Figure 8 are further illustrated here, as each of the tests
has a similar Coulombic efficiency and differing voltaic efficiencies.
The coatings with the highest voltaic efficiencies also tended to
have the best capacity retention. This may indicate the importance
of focusing the conductive ink at the interface of the VRB, as opposed
to simply maximizing the overall mass of the conductive ink in the
electrodes. This is likely due to the formation of a highly conductive
CNT network, as compared to the random distribution of the material
throughout the graphite felt. It should be noted that the pristine
membrane case was unable to adequately discharge at a constant current
of 50 mA/cm2, so the values reflected for the pristine
membrane voltaic efficiencies in Figure 9 are likely measured in the range of 35–45
mA/cm2. This choice was made for the sake of comparison
at a higher current density, and it is expected that these values
will be higher than they realistically should be for the pristine
case. To determine the robustness of these coatings, coated membranes
were analyzed via SEM and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) both before
and after 200 cycles, as shown in Figure 10. It was found that there was little to
no observable change in the surface characteristics of the coating
via both the SEM images and the FTIR spectra. This further demonstrates
the promise for the use of these conductive coatings in VRB applications.

4 Conclusions
A very
thin CNT-based conductive carbon coating (∼0.015
mg of CNT/cm2) onto Nafion 117 membranes can improve the
rate capability of VRBs. Despite a slightly higher electrical surface
resistivity, thinner coatings seemed to yield the highest starting
discharge capacities and highest capacity retention over a large number
of cycles. The use of a copper mesh mask during the electrospraying
process created discrete, ordered domains of coating coverage, which
seemed to allow for adequately high proton transport during cycling,
while still decreasing the surface resistivity of the membrane, and
thus the interfacial resistance. This coating technique could be used
as a fast, stand-alone pretreatment of membranes before use in a VRB.
It could also be used in tandem with other electrode enhancement techniques
or on other types of ion-exchange membranes to yield a more efficient
battery.
