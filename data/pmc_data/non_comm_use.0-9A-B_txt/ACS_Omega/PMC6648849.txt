Microtubules
(MTs) are key cytoskeletal components that modulate
various cellular activities with their dynamic structural changes,
including polymerization and depolymerization. To monitor the dynamics
of MTs in living cells, many drug-based fluorescent probes have been
developed; however, these also potentially disturb the polymerization/depolymerization
of MTs. Here, we report nondrug, peptide-based fluorescent probes
to monitor MTs in living cells. We employed a Tau-derived peptide
(TP) that has been shown to bind MTs without inhibiting
polymerization/depolymerization in vitro. We show that a tetramethylrhodamine
(TMR)-labeled TP (TP–TMR) is internalized
into HepG2 cells and binds to intracellular MTs, enabling visualization
of MTs as clear, fibrous structures. The binding of TP–TMR shows no apparent effects on polymerization/depolymerization of
MTs induced by MT-targeted drugs and temperature change. The main
uptake mechanism of TP–TMR was elucidated as endocytosis,
and partial endosomal escape resulted in the binding of TP–TMR to MTs. TP–TMR exhibited no cytotoxicity compared
with MT-targeted drug scaffolds. These results indicate that TP scaffolds can be exploited as useful MT-targeted tools
in living cells, such as in long-term imaging of MTs.

==== Body
Introduction
Microtubules (MTs)
are cytoskeletal components that serve important
roles in various cellular processes, such as intracellular material
transportation, cellular support, and cell division.1−3 MTs are hollow tubular structures consisting of tubulin heterodimers
and are constantly extending (polymerizing) and contracting (depolymerizing)
in cells. The dynamics of polymerization/depolymerization by MTs are
essential to maintain cellular activities, including the cell cycle.1−3 Directional transport of intracellular cargos on MTs by motor proteins
(kinesin and dynein) is also important in cells, which have been widely
utilized to construct MT-based active materials.2,4−9 Because of the importance of MTs, various methodologies have been
developed to monitor MTs in living cells without chemical fixation
to understand and modulate the dynamics of MTs.10−12 Expression
of fluorescent protein-fused tubulin is a general method to monitor
MTs in living cells.11 However, the low
efficiency of transfection and low expression levels may be problematic.
Alternatively, small-molecule fluorescent probes have been developed
by using MT-binding drugs as scaffolds.12 Taxol and colchicine are well-known MT-targeted drugs that inhibit
depolymerization and polymerization of MTs, respectively.13 By conjugating fluorophores to taxol14−22 and colchicine23 scaffolds, intracellular
imaging of MTs has been achieved with high efficiency and high resolution.
These drug-based probes are useful because of their permeability to
cells and high selectivity for MTs. However, these drug scaffolds
have several problems, such as low water solubility and complex structures
with limited numbers of reactive groups.14−16,18,20,22 Most importantly, since drug-based probes potentially induce cytotoxicity
by affecting the polymerization/depolymerization of MTs, optimization
of the probe structures is essential for imaging of MTs with minimal
cytotoxicity.18,20,22 Thus, a nondrug MT-targeted molecule will be useful to monitor MTs
without disturbing the intracellular dynamics of MTs.

Peptides
are attractive candidates for monitoring MTs because of
their biocompatibility, sequence-dependent cell permeability, and
molecular recognition capability.24−28 In fact, various MT-binding peptides have been developed
but the purpose was construction of MT-targeted drugs, and not live-cell
imaging of MTs.29−35 Ghosh et al. have developed short (4–9-mer) peptides and
peptoids for modulation of intracellular dynamics of MTs by promoting
or inhibiting polymerization of MTs.30−35 Although binding of some peptides to MTs in fixed cells has been
imaged, no obvious fibrous structures of the peptide-bound MTs were
observed.31,32 This may be due to the low affinity of short
peptides for tubulin, as their dissociation constants (Kd) are in the millimolar range.31,32 It is anticipated that peptides with high affinity for MTs without
disturbing polymerization/depolymerization of MTs are suitable to
monitor MTs in living cells.

We previously developed an MT-binding
peptide based on an MT-associated
protein, Tau (Figure 1a).36 The Tau-derived peptide TP (CGGGKKHVPGGGSVQIVYKPVDL) was designed on the basis of a repeat
domain of Tau involved in binding to the inner surface of MTs. From
our binding analysis in vitro (not in cellulo), TP binds
to a taxol-binding pocket of tubulin located inside MTs with high
affinity (Kd = 6.0 μM) by preincubation
with tubulin and subsequent polymerization of the peptide–tubulin
complex. In contrast, TP binds to the outer surface of
MTs when incubated with preformed MTs. Binding of TP does
not inhibit the polymerization/depolymerization of MTs in vitro. In
addition, TP has high water solubility at millimolar
concentrations. These properties of TP are suitable for
an MT-binding motif in living cells. Here, we prepared fluorescently
labeled TP and analyzed binding to MTs in living cells.
We demonstrated that TP can bind to intracellular MTs
via endocytic uptake and subsequent endosomal escape (Figure 1b) without inhibiting polymerization/depolymerization
of MTs.

Results and Discussion
Red fluorescent
tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-5-maleimide was conjugated
to the N-terminal cysteine of TP as a fluorophore according
to our reported procedure.36 The TMR-labeled TP (TP–TMR) and 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine
(TMR–COOH) showed similar fluorescence spectra (Figure S1), indicating that TP–TMR can be used for imaging without quenching TMR. Cellular uptake of TP–TMR into human hepatoma HepG2 cells was analyzed
by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Before incubation with TP–TMR, the cells were transfected with green fluorescent
protein-fused tubulin (tubulin–GFP) using BacMam technology
(Thermo Fischer Scientific), which uses baculovirus as a carrier to
deliver and express genes in mammalian cells. Upon incubation of 10
μM TP–TMR with the cells for 6 h at 37 °C, TP–TMR was found to be internalized into the cells
and bind to intracellular MTs, observed as clear fibrous structures
(Figure 2a and Movie S1). The fibers in the TP–TMR channel were essentially colocalized with the fibers observed in
the tubulin–GFP channel (Figure 2b,c). Quantitative analysis of the distribution of
fluorescent intensity also showed colocalization of TP–TMR and tubulin–GFP fiber structures (Figure 2d,e), indicating the binding of TP–TMR to intracellular MTs. In particular, binding of TP–TMR to MTs at the edges of cells was clearly observed (white arrows
in Figure 2a), probably
because of the high density of MTs at cell edges to exert cellular
support and cell migration.37,38 Distribution of TP–TMR-bound MTs throughout cells can be seen in Movie S1, which shows cross-sectional scans of
cells acquired at different heights. On the other hand, the dotlike
structures observed in the TP–TMR channel (Figure 2a) were not colocalized
with tubulin–GFP (Figure 2b,c). The dots were expected to be endosomes, as investigated
below. Even by using lower concentration of TP–TMR and shorter incubation time compared with the above condition (10
μM TP–TMR, 6 h incubation), the binding
of TP–TMR to intracellular MTs was still observed;
however, the fluorescence intensity of TP–TMR was
low (Figures S2 and S3). Thus, we used
the above condition (10 μM TP–TMR, 6 h of
incubation) in the following experiments. In contrast with TP–TMR, entry of TMR–COOH into HepG2 cells was not observed even
after 6 h of incubation (Figure S4), indicating
that the TP moiety is required for cellular uptake. These
results show that TP–TMR can penetrate into cells
and bind to intracellular MTs. In addition, even after incubation
of the cells for 24 h upon uptake of TP–TMR, the
binding of TP–TMR to intracellular MTs was still
observed, indicating that TP–TMR can be used for
long-term imaging of MTs (Figure S5).

White arrows in image (a) indicate the binding of TP–TMR to MTs at cell edges. (e) Distribution of TP–TMR and tubulin–GFP was quantified by measuring fluorescence
intensity in the lined areas of the expanded image (d). All scale
bars are 10 μm. See Movie S1 for
cross-sectional scans of cells acquired at different heights. Tubulin–GFP
was expressed in HepG2 cells; then, 10 μM TP–TMR was incubated with the cells for 6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342.

The effects of MT-binding drugs taxol and colchicine
on the binding
of TP–TMR to intracellular MTs were evaluated.
Even after coincubation of 10 μM TP–TMR and
10 μM taxol (a MT-stabilizing agent) with HepG2 cells, fibrous
structures were observed in the TP–TMR channel
(Figure 3a). The fibers
were essentially colocalized with the fibers in the tubulin–GFP
channel (Figure 3b,c),
indicating the binding of TP–TMR to intracellular
MTs even in the presence of taxol. We have previously shown that TP–TMR has two binding sites in MTs: (1) a taxol-binding
pocket of tubulin when incubating TP–TMR with
tubulin and subsequent polymerization of the peptide–tubulin
complex and (2) the outer surface of MTs when incubating TP–TMR with preformed MTs.36 Because coincubation
with taxol showed little effect on the fibrous structures in the TP–TMR channel (Figure 3a), it is possible that TP–TMR mainly
binds to the outer surface of preformed MTs. When 10 μM TP–TMR was incubated with HepG2 cells in the presence
of 10 μM colchicine (an MT-destabilizing agent), cell morphology
changed to being round and only dotlike structures were observed but
no fiber structures were observed in the TP–TMR channel (Figure 3d). Also, tubulin–GFP was homogeneously distributed in the
cytoplasm and did not form fibrous MTs (Figure 3e). These results clearly indicate that the
polymerization of MTs was inhibited by colchicine and TP–TMR-bound MTs were not formed under the conditions employed. To elucidate
whether TP–TMR-bound MTs depolymerize/polymerize
in cells, TP–TMR-treated cells were cooled and
heated as depolymerization and polymerization conditions, respectively.
The fibrous structures in the TP–TMR channel observed
before cooling (Figure 3g) disappeared after cooling (Figure 3h), showing the depolymerization of TP–TMR-bound MTs. Upon heating the cells, the polymerization occurred to
form TP–TMR-bound MTs (Figure 3i). Thus, binding of TP–TMR exhibits no apparent effects on depolymerization/polymerization
of MTs in living cells, indicating that TP–TMR may be useful in monitoring MT dynamics.

was incubated with the cells for 6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cell nuclei were stained by Hoechst 33342. (g–i)
Temperature-dependent depolymerization/polymerization of TP–TMR-bound MTs in HepG2 cells. CLSM images were acquired (g) immediately,
(h) upon cooling at ∼4 °C for 40 min, and (i) upon heating
at ∼40 °C for 5 min. White arrows indicate TP–TMR-bound MTs. All scale bars are 10 μm.

The cellular uptake mechanism of TP–TMR was
elucidated by cooling the cells during uptake to inhibit an energy-dependent
uptake process.39 Uptake of TP–TMR in HepG2 cells was significantly inhibited at 4 °C (Figure S6). This result indicates that uptake
of TP–TMR involves an endocytic pathway. Since
dotlike structures along with fibrous structures were observed in
the TP–TMR channel when incubated at 37 °C
(Figure 2a), it is
possible that TP–TMR is partially released from
endosomes, distributed in cytoplasm, and then bound to MTs. To investigate
this hypothesis, colocalization of TP–TMR and
a typical endosome marker, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled transferrin
(FITC–transferrin), was identified.40 As a result, the dotlike structures in the TP–TMR channel were colocalized with FITC–transferrin, whereas the
fibrous structures in the TP–TMR channel were
not observed in the FITC–transferrin channel (Figure S7). Thus, the dotlike structures in the TP–TMR channel are attributed to endosomes and partial endosomal escape
of TP–TMR results in the binding to MTs observed
as fibrous structures in the TP–TMR channel. When
human glioma U251 cells were used instead of HepG2 cells, only dotlike
structures were observed but no fiber structures of MTs were observed
in the TP–TMR channel (Figure S8), indicating that TP–TMR was internalized
into U251 cells via an endocytic pathway without subsequent endosomal
escape.

We checked the bioactivity of TP–TMR using
the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay, a method to measure
cell viability by evaluating mitochondrial activity in living cells. TP–TMR over a range of 1–20 μM showed
no cytotoxicity even after incubation with HepG2 cells for 24 h (Figure 4). Even after longer
incubation time (72 h), TP–TMR showed no cytotoxicity
(Figure S9). In contrast, MT-binding drugs
taxol and colchicine showed clear cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 4).
The cytotoxicity of taxol and colchicine is due to inhibition of depolymerization
and polymerization of MTs, respectively.13 Thus, TP–TMR showed no cytotoxicity because
binding of TP–TMR to MTs exhibits minimal effects
on depolymerization/polymerization of MTs, as described above. These
results indicate that TP is useful as a scaffold for
MT binding for long-term usage without disturbing cellular activity.

HepG2 cells were incubated with 0–20 μM TP–TMR (red), taxol (black), or colchicine (blue) for 24 h at 37 °C
under 5% CO2. Cell viability was evaluated by the WST assay.
The error bars represent standard deviation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a fluorescently
labeled
Tau-derived peptide, TP–TMR, can be successfully
used for imaging of MTs in living cells. Binding of TP–TMR to MTs showed no apparent effects on polymerization/depolymerization
of MTs and no cytotoxicity in contrast with the known MT-binding drugs
taxol and colchicine. Thus, TP–TMR can be used
for imaging of MTs without disturbing cellular activities. Especially,
time-lapse imaging of MTs during cell division is important to analyze
the functions of MTs in living cells. We also envision that the TP scaffold may be applicable for MT-targeted modulation of
cellular activities. A notable example is optical modulation of MT
dynamics by designing photoswitchable MT-destabilizing agents, enabling
control of mitosis and cell death.41 In
such a way, design of TP to control the dynamics of MTs
is in progress.

Methods
Equipment and Materials
TP–TMR was
prepared as described in our previous work.36 High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to purify TP–TMR using a Shimadzu LC-6AD liquid chromatograph
with GL Science Inertsil WP300 C18 columns (20 × 250 mm2). Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Jasco FP-8200.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) measurement was carried
out using a FluoView FV10i (Olympus). The reagents were purchased
from Watanabe Chemical Ind., Ltd., Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Dojindo
Laboratories Co., Ltd. and Wako Pure Chemical Industries. All chemicals
were used without further purification.

Cell Culture
Human
hepatoma HepG2 cells and human glioma
U251 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium. All medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1%
MEM nonessential amino acids (v/v, Sigma M7145). Cells were maintained
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and a subculture was
performed every 3–4 days.

CLSM Measurements
HepG2 cells and U251 cells were seeded
onto a single-well glass bottom dish at 2.0 × 104 cells/well
in a final volume of 100 μL and incubated for ∼24 h at
37 °C, 5% CO2. CellLight tubulin–GFP, BacMam
2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the cells (1 μL
per well) and incubated for further 24 h, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After removal of the medium, 10 μM TP–TMR in the medium was added to the cells and incubated for a designed
period. For evaluation of the effects of MT-binding drugs, 10 μM
taxol or 10 μM colchicine was coincubated with 10 μM TP–TMR at the same time. For evaluation of the endosomal
escape, 0.1 mg/mL FITC–transferrin was coincubated with 10
μM TP–TMR at the same time. After washing
with PBS, the cells were incubated with 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342
for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After washing with PBS,
the medium was added to the cells and fluorescence images were acquired. TP–TMR was excited with 550 nm and observed through
a 574 nm emission band-pass filter (red). Tubulin–GFP was excited
with 489 nm and observed through a 510 nm emission band-pass filter
(green). FITC–transferrin was excited with 495 nm and observed
through a 519 nm emission band-pass filter (green). Hoechst 33342
was excited with 352 nm and observed through a 455 nm emission band-pass
filter (cyan).

Cell Viability Assay (WST Assay)
The cultured HepG2
cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1.0 × 104 cells/well
in a final volume of 100 μL and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C,
5% CO2. The culture medium was replaced with medium containing
0–20 μM TP–TMR, taxol, or colchicine
and incubated for 24 or 72 h. The culture medium was replaced with
fresh medium, and 10 μL of the Cell Counting Kit-8 reaction
solution (Dojindo, Japan) was added to each well. After incubation
for 4 h, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Cell viability (%)
was calculated by setting the absorbance of the untreated control
cells as 100%.
