In the present paper, the reduction reaction of high-purity
MoO3 with CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases
in the
temperature range of 901–948 K is investigated via the thermogravimetric
analysis technology. The results show that reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 follows a three-step reaction process, viz.,
MoO3 is first reduced into Mo9O26, followed by Mo4O11, and finally to MoO2. The reaction sequences of MoO3 → Mo9O26 → Mo4O11 →
MoO2 are proposed, which are quite different from those
observed on reduction of MoO3 by pure H2 or
CO gases. Pure Mo9O26 and Mo4O11 could be synthesized once suitable time was controlled.
Rate-controlling steps for the reduction from MoO3 to Mo9O26 and Mo9O26 to MoO2 (include both Mo9O26 to Mo4O11 and Mo4O11 to MoO2) are interfacial chemical reactions, with the activation energies
of 318.326 and 112.047 kJ/mol, respectively. This study also discovers
that the as-synthesized MoO2 keeps the same platelet-shaped
and smooth morphology as the MoO3 raw material; however,
its particles size gradually increased as the reaction proceeds due
to the formation of low-melting-point eutectic and the sticking of
different particles.

1 Introduction
Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) possesses a high melting point
(>2773 K)1 and density (6.47 g/cm3)2 and a low oxygen content, which
have
made it become a potential Mo source for the direct alloying steelmaking
or production of ferromolybdenum alloys.3 Compared to molybdenum trioxide (MoO3; melting point:
1068 K; density: 4.692 g/cm3),4,5 MoO2 will not sublime at the normal steelmaking temperature (1773
K) and could increase the transport or smelting process, which will
further increase the yield of molybdenum (Mo) greatly. Therefore,
the preparation of MoO2 has attracted much attention in
recent years and many routes have been developed. These routes include
hydrogen reduction (reduction of MoO3 with pure H2),6,7 water vapor oxidation (oxidation of molybdenum sulfide
concentrate with water vapor),8,9 and solid-phase reaction
(roasting of mixed MoS2 and MoO3 powders).10,11 As for the gas–solid reaction, H2 gas as the reducing
agent has been widely studied,6,7 and pure CO gas was
also adopted in our previous work.12 However,
CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases as the reducing gases
have never been used before. In this paper, one of the purposes is
to explore a new approach for the preparation of MoO2,
so pure H2 or CO was not adopted, and then the CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases were used instead.

Recently,
synthesis of tungsten carbides (W2C) by the
reduction–carburization of MoO3 with different reducing
gases has been widely reported.13−16 However, related study for the preparation of molybdenum
carbides (Mo2C), especially for the use of CO as the reducing
gas, was lacking.17 In our previous work,18 CO gas was first adopted to produce Mo2C by using MoO3 as the raw material, in which it was discovered
that the preparation processes mainly proceeded following two stages:
the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 and the carburization
from MoO2 to Mo2C. The characterizations of
the intermediate product MoO2 having great influences on
those of the final product Mo2C were also concluded. To
avoid the occurrence of carbon deposition reaction, as shown in eq 1, a certain volume fraction
of CO2 was also added into the reducing gases. It was found12 that when the volume fraction of CO2 is about 15 vol %, the reaction kinetics curve is very similar to
that of pure CO in the initial period; in the latter period, the reaction
rate is still very rapid, which is much faster than that obtained
by using pure CO due to the inhibiting effect of carbon deposition
reaction, and then pure MoO2 or Mo2C could be
easily obtained. When the volume fraction of CO2 increased
to 30 vol % or more, however, the reaction rate will be decreased
largely, which was not beneficial for the preparation of MoO2. Therefore, CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases were selected
for the preparation of MoO2 in the current paper, which
could also be used for the preparation of Mo2C. Furthermore,
the reduction mechanism and kinetics of MoO3 to MoO2 by H2 have been widely studied.19−22 However, related studies for
the reaction processes of MoO3 to MoO2 or MoO3 to Mo2C by CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed
gases were extremely scarce. To understand the whole reaction processes
from MoO3 to Mo2C, the reduction mechanism and
kinetics of MoO3 to MoO2 were studied first,
which could also act as a preliminary work for the preparation of
Mo2C 1  As mentioned above, one of the current objectives
is to develop a new and simple method for the preparation of MoO2 with the use of CO–CO2 mixed gases (CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases are selected as the reducing gases
due to the good inhibiting effect on the carbon deposition reaction
and the rapid reaction rate). At the same time, the reduction mechanism
and kinetics of MoO3 to MoO2 by the CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases are illustrated, which will further
give a better understanding on the reduction–carburization
mechanism from MoO3 to Mo2C.

2 Results
2.1 Thermogravimetric-Differential Thermal Analysis
(TG-DTA) Experiments
The mass loss ratio (defined as Wt) of high-purity MoO3 reduced by
CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases was calculated by eq 2 2  where m0 and mt are the masses of initial
sample and that reduced for a period of time t, respectively.

Reduction extent (defined as α) of the sample was calculated
as the ratio of mass loss ratio Wt to the theoretical maximum mass loss ratio Wmax, as shown in eq 3 3  

2.1.1 Nonisothermal TG-DTA Experiments
Figure 1 shows the
nonisothermal TG curves of reducing high-purity MoO3 with
CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases from room temperature
to 1550 K under four different heating rates: 5, 10, 15, and 20 K/min.
From Figure 1, it can
be clearly seen that the total reaction processes can be divided into
three different stages with respect to the heating rates of 5, 10,
and 15 K/min. The first stage is in the range of mass loss ratio from
zero to −11.5428%, which is almost consistent with −11.1157%
(corresponding to the mass change from MoO3 to MoO2, as shown in eq 4). Therefore, it can be deduced that the main reaction is the reduction
of MoO3 to MoO2 in the first stage. The mass
loss ratio for the second stage is −29.6121%, which is almost
in good agreement with −29.1788% (corresponding to the mass
change from MoO3 to Mo2C, as shown in eq 5). If considering the newly
as-formed MoO2 as the reactant, then the main reaction
in the second stage is the reduction of MoO2 to Mo2C, as shown in eq 6. The third stage is the final platform section, corresponding to
the mass loss ratio of −33.3472%, which is exactly equal to
the theoretical maximum mass loss ratio from MoO3 to metallic
Mo, as shown in eq 7.
As for the case of 20 K/min, however, the TG curve is a little different
from the above three cases (this experiment at the heating rate of
20 K/min was conducted twice, and the results are almost the same).
The first stage is almost the same as the lower heating rates (5,
10, and 15 K/min), that is, the mass loss ratio is also from zero
to −11.5428%; as the temperature increases, the second and
third stages are nearly overlapped and no obvious stable region existed;
however, the final mass loss ratio is still equal to −33.3472%.
All in all, it can be concluded that reduction of MoO3 with
CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases can be divided into
three main stages in the temperature range of room temperature to
1550 K: the first is from MoO3 to MoO2, then
from MoO2 to Mo2C, and finally to generate metallic
Mo 4   5   6   7  

Figure 1 TG curves of reducing high-purity MoO3 with CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases under different heating rates (5,
10, 15, and 20 K/min).

The nonisothermal thermogravimetric-differential
thermal analysis
(TG-DTA) curves at the heating rate of 10 K/min are also plotted and
shown in Figure 2,
which may contribute to the deeper understanding of the reaction processes.
From the DTA curve (denoted by the blue line), it can be known that
reduction from MoO3 to MoO2 is an intense exothermic
reaction, as seen by the sharp exothermic peak 1. Besides, the exothermic
reaction from MoO2 to Mo2C can also be obtained,
as seen by the broad exothermic peak 2. As to the third stage (from
Mo2C to metallic Mo), a sharp endothermic peak 3 is obviously
observed, which suggests that the process from Mo2C to
Mo is an endothermic reaction. Furthermore, from the DTG curve (denoted
by the red line), the beginning (defined as T1) and ending reaction temperatures (defined as T2) from MoO3 to MoO2 can be obtained,
i.e., T1 = 898 K, T2 = 1056 K (at the points for the values of DTG equal to zero).
Accordingly, the ending reaction temperature from MoO2 to
Mo2C (defined as T3) and the
beginning and ending reaction temperatures from Mo2C to
Mo (defined as T4 and T5, respectively) can also be known, i.e., T3 = 1361 K, T4 = 1443 K, and T5 = 1522 K. Similarly, the corresponding values
for the heating rates of 5, 15, and 20 K/min can also be obtained,
as listed in Table 1.

rate of 10 K/min.

for Each Stage during the Total Reduction Processes in the Temperature
Range of Room Temperature to 1550 K at Different Heating Rates
 	temperature
(K)	
heating rate (K/min)	T1	T2	T3	T4	T5	
5	888	1019	1283	1443	1507	
10	898	1056	1361	1443	1522	
15	904	1079	1425	1445	1528	
20	907	1085	 	 	1502	
From Table 1, it
can be known that T1, T2, and T3 all increased with
increasing heating rate. The larger the heating rate is, the higher
the beginning and ending reaction temperatures will be. T1 is in the range of 888–907 K, which is larger
than that of reducing industrial-grade MoO3 with pure CO
as the reducing gas (827 K).12 The reasons
for the increased temperature are due to the different raw materials
and different reducing gases (CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed
gases vs pure CO). However, it can be clearly seen that the T4 values are almost equal to each other for
the heating rates of 5, 10, and 15 K/min, at a temperature of about
1443 K. From Figures 1 and 2, it can be found that a stable zone
for Mo2C (the result of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
is not given) always existed in those cases, which may provide enough
time for the heat transport. Once the reaction temperature achieves,
Mo2C will begin to proceed the next reaction. As to T5, it is also increased with the increasing
heating rate from 5 to 15 K/min. Due to the fact that T3 is increased with the increasing heating rate, however, T4 was almost constant (about 1443 K in the current
paper). So, when the heating rate was further increased to 20 K/min, T3 will be further increased and even almost
equaled T4, and then the two stages (from
MoO2 to Mo2C, and then to metallic Mo) will
be overlapped to approximate one stage, which would lead to T5 a little lower than those obtained at lower
heating rates and the different kinetic curves, as shown in Figure 1.

2.1.2 Isothermal TG Experiments
One of
the purposes of the current study was to provide a new route for the
preparation of high-purity MoO2. So, temperatures in the
range of T1 to T2 shown in Table 1 were selected for the isothermal experiments. In this paper, temperatures
of 901, 916, 932, and 948 K were adopted, and the corresponding experimental
results are displayed in Figure 3 (the mass loss ratio curves have converted to the
relationship between reaction extent and reaction time for convenience
of the following kinetics analysis). It can be easily seen from this
figure that the reaction extent depends strongly on the reaction temperature.
The higher the reaction temperature is, the faster the reaction rate
will be. Also, an obvious inflection point can be seen in the kinetic
curves at the reaction extent of about 0.1111, which is in good agreement
with the mass change from MoO3 to Mo9O26, as expressed by eq 8. The generation of Mo9O26 can be further proved
in the following XRD sections. Meanwhile, the reaction extent has
an obvious linear relationship with reaction temperature, which can
also be seen both in the stages from 0 to 0.1111 and 0.1111 to 1.
The slopes in the stage from 0 to 0.1111 are more sensitive than those
in the stage from 0.1111 to 1 (temperature is more beneficial for
the increase of reaction rate in the stage from 0 to 0.1111 than that
from 0.1111 to 1). 8

2.2 XRD Analyses
Figure 4 shows the XRD patterns of reaction products
obtained by reducing high-purity MoO3 completely with CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases at the four different temperatures.
The results showed that MoO2 (PDF card No. 32-671) is always
the only final product without other impurities, which is in good
agreement with the kinetic curves shown in Figure 3a.

To clarify the phase-transition laws during the
reaction processes,
XRD patterns of samples obtained at different reaction extents were
also detected. In this paper, 932 K is selected as the studied temperature,
and α = 0.0286, 0.0895, 0.2492, 0.4965, 0.8473, and 1 were chosen
as the analyzed reaction extents, as indicated in Figure 5.

reducing high-purity MoO3 with
CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases at 932 K. The directions
indicated by the arrows are the as-prepared samples for the following
XRD and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analyses.

Figure 6 shows the
XRD results of reaction products obtained according to Figure 5. When the reaction extent
is α1 = 0.0286, most of the MoO3 raw materials
are reduced to Mo9O26 (PDF card No. 12-753),
which is a new intermediate product and not found in pure H2 or CO reduction of MoO3 to MoO2.7,12 As the reduction continues (α2 = 0.0895), MoO3 nearly disappeared, and then the main product turns to be
Mo9O26, as shown in Figure 6b, which can be seen clearer in Figure 7. Combining Figure 6a,b, it can be deduced
that the main reaction is reducing MoO3 to Mo9O26 in the preliminary stage (α in the range of
0–0.0895), which agrees well with the results (α in the
range of 0–0.1111) shown in Figure 3. When the reaction extent achieves 0.2492,
however, both MoO3 and Mo9O26 suddenly
disappeared and then the products are replaced by Mo4O11 (PDF card No. 5-337); the formation of Mo4O11 was also found in refs (7, 12) where pure H2 or CO were used as the reducing gases.
Besides, a small peak for MoO2 is also detected, which
indicates that MoO2 is also formed in this situation, as
shown in Figures 6c
and 7. After that, the main peaks of Mo4O11 and MoO2 are monotonously decreased
and increased, respectively, as shown in Figure 6d,e. When the reduction reaction is complete
(α6 = 1), the products are all composed of MoO2, as shown in Figure 6f. Therefore, it can be inferred that reduction from Mo9O26 to Mo4O11 is very rapid
and could hardly be controlled. Thus, the main reaction in the latter
period (α in the range of 0.1111–1) is the reduction
of Mo4O11 to MoO2.

2.3 FE-SEM Examinations
The typical micrographs
of reaction products obtained by reducing high-purity MoO3 completely with CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases for
different temperatures at various magnifications are shown in Figure 8. At 916 K, the gross
particle size and micrograph of the as-prepared MoO2 keep
the same as the MoO3 raw material, compared Figure 8A1–A3 with Figure 19. Also, several
small particles or nuclei are formed on the smooth platelet-shaped
surface. From the blue sections shown on the top left corner in Figure 8A3, some water-waves
streaks could be easily seen. As the temperature increases, the gross
characteristic of the as-prepared MoO2 is typically maintained
and the smooth surface is still embedded with many small nuclei, as
shown in Figure 8B1–B3.
The images obtained at higher temperatures (932 and 948 K) are almost
the same as those obtained at lower temperatures (901 and 916 K),
all of which included both smooth surface and small nuclei as well
as the water-waves streaks. To identify the possible phase compositions
for the small nuclei, the backscattering technology is adopted and
the experimental results are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that the colors for the
smooth surface and small nuclei have some differences, suggesting
that the main element distributions are different, which can be further
verified by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results
shown in Table 2 (illustrated in Figure 9). The smooth surface and small nuclei can
be identified to be MoO2 and MoOxCy, respectively. All in all, the
morphologies obtained in the current work have no obvious relationship
with the reaction temperature in the temperature range of 901–948
K.

Figure 10 shows
the FE-SEM images of reaction products obtained by reducing high-purity
MoO3 with CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases
at 932 K for different reaction extents (defined as the ratio of mass
loss ratio of sample at time t to the theoretical
maximum mass loss ratio from MoO3 to MoO2).
When the reaction extent is α1 = 0.0286, the products
almost kept the same smooth surface as the MoO3 raw material
(as seen in Figure 19) and no obvious nuclei is found (as seen in Figure 10A). When the reaction extent arrives at
α2 = 0.0895 (the products are almost Mo9O26 as shown in Figures 6 and 7), many big pores are
formed on the smooth surface, which may result from the tensile stress
generated due to the volume decreased during the oxygen removal. As
the reaction proceeds forward (α3 = 0.2492, products
included Mo4O11 with few MoO2, as
shown in Figures 6 and 7), small nuclei begin to form; in the meantime,
liquid drops between two platelet-shaped particles can also be observed,
as shown in Figure 10C. When the reaction extent reaches α4 = 0.4965,
the amount of small nuclei and liquid drops increased even if most
of the products still have a smooth surface, as shown in Figure 10D. The tendency
for the increase of small nuclei is maintained when the reaction continues,
as shown in Figure 10E. After the reaction completes, a larger number of small nuclei
can be obviously seen on the smooth platelet-shaped surface, as displayed
in Figure 10F. Furthermore,
cracks or pores formed in Figure 10B nearly disappeared, which may be filled with the
newly as-formed liquid drops.

3 Discussion
3.1 Reduction Mechanism
As can be known
from Figures 1 and 2, reduction of MoO3 with CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases in the range of room temperature
to 1550 K can be mainly divided into three stages: the first is reducing
MoO3 into MoO2 (MoO3 → MoO2, T1 < T < T2), followed by carburizing MoO2 into
Mo2C (MoO2 → Mo2C, T2 < T < T3), and the last stage is to generate metallic Mo (Mo2C → Mo, T4< T < T5). Herein, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 are the experimental values which vary with heating
rates, as shown in Table 1. That is to say, lower temperature is beneficial for the
formation of MoO2, higher temperature for Mo, and temperatures
between them contribute to the formation of Mo–C compounds.
The current results can be further proved by the phase diagram of
CO–MoO3 at 1 atm total pressure, as shown in Figure 11, which is calculated
by the thermodynamic software FactSage 7.0 (ThermFact Ltd., Montreal,
Canada).23 One of the difference is that
the critical transformation temperatures from MoO2 to Mo2C and Mo2C to Mo of the experimental data shown
in Table 1 are larger
than those of the theoretical values shown in Figure 11 (1019 vs 907 K, and 1443 vs 1343 K, respectively).
Those deviations resulted from the dynamic condition and the nonequilibrium
behavior of the present experimental procedures.

Figure 11 Stable gaseous and solid
reaction products after equilibration
of different molar ratios of CO and (CO + MoO3) at 1 atm
total pressure.

As to the first stage (MoO3 →
MoO2) mentioned above, some new and interesting phenomena
are found by
deeper investigation. From the XRD analyses (Figures 6 and 7), it is found
that this stage can be further divided into three minor steps, i.e.,
MoO3 is first reduced to Mo9O26 (MoO3 → Mo9O26, as shown in eq 8), then to Mo4O11 (Mo9O26 → Mo4O11, as shown in eq 9), and finally to MoO2 (Mo4O11 → MoO2, as shown in eq 10). For expression convenience, those three
minor steps are defined as one-step, two-step, and three-step reactions,
respectively. The formations of Mo9O26 and Mo4O11 can also be supported by Figure 11, from which it can be known
that Mo9O26 and Mo4O11 as the intermediate products are indeed formed during the reduction
process. However, other suboxide, such as Mo8O23, is not detected in Figures 6 and 7, which may be due to its small
amount. Herein, according to our previous work,12,18 Mo4O11 is the only intermediate product produced
in the reduction process of MoO3 with pure CO gas. However,
both Mo9O26 and Mo4O11 are detected in this work, even nearly pure Mo9O26 and Mo4O11 are obtained when the reaction
extents are 0.0895 and 0.2492, respectively. The possible reasons
may be explained as follows: when pure CO is used, reaction ratios
for eqs 8–10 are all very fast but differ from each other; the
newly as-formed Mo9O26 could rapidly be reduced
to Mo4O11; in other words, the reaction ratios
for eq 9 are much faster
than those for eq 8,
which would make Mo9O26 exhausted and hardly
accumulated, and then Mo9O26 could not be detected
in the XRD patterns, showing that MoO3 was reduced to Mo4O11 directly, as shown in eq 11. However, when CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases (low CO partial pressure) is used, the reaction
ratios for eqs 8–10 are all decreased. The lower the CO partial pressure
is, the lower the reaction ratio will be. Also, it may be deduced
that, in this case, the reaction ratio for eq 8 is much faster than that for eq 9, instead. And then, eq 9 can be even ignored at this initial
period (α in the range of 0–0.1111). After MoO3 is reduced to Mo9O26 completely, eq 9 begins. Thereafter, the reaction
ratio for eq 9 is also
very faster than that for eq 10; at this moment, eq 10 can also be ignored. Similarly, after Mo9O26 is reduced to Mo4O11 completely, eq 10 begins. According to
the analysis, it can be concluded that eqs 8–10 are independent
of each other. Only when the last reaction finishes, the next starts.
Combining the current experimental results and refs (12, 18), it can also be deduced that low CO partial
pressure is beneficial for the formation of Mo9O26, while high CO partial pressure, for Mo4O11 and MoO2. Therefore, the current paper would also provide
an important guide role for the preparation of pure Mo9O26 and Mo4O11. The corresponding
reaction sequences are summarized in Figure 12. 9   10   11  

Figure 12 Schematic illustrating the reaction pathways
of MoO3 with pure CO and CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases.

On the other hand, it can be found that particles
size of the as-prepared
MoO2 are much larger than that of used MoO3 raw
materials, as comparing Figures 8 and 10 with Figure 19. Also, numerous small nuclei are generated on the
surface. These phenomena can be explained as follows: when CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases are used, the reduction of MoO3 to Mo9O26 begins first, and the diffusion
of reducing gas CO and release of product gas CO2 will
lead to the formation of pores or cracks on the surface, as shown
in Figure 10B. After
MoO3 is reduced to Mo9O26 completely,
the reduction of Mo9O26 to Mo4O11 starts. At this time, CO2 is still produced and
released, and pores still existed. Besides, several small nuclei will
be generated due to the formation of eutectic between Mo4O11 and other Mo–C compounds (see Table 2 and illustrated
in Figure 9), which
has a much lower melting point (about 683 K), as can be supported
by Figure 11. The
formation of MoOxCy is also reported in other refs (24−26), in which hydrocarbon compounds were used as the
reducing gases. Recently, the generation of MoOxNy during the NH3 reduction
of the Mo–O compound has also been reported,27 and the nuclei of MoOxNy was also very small and the morphology resembled
liquid flow, which is very similar to the current experimental results.
Thus, the hypothesis for the formation of the MoOxCy compound is reasonable in the
present paper. As the reaction proceeds forward, the amount of eutectic
will also be increased. Meantime, the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 by CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases
is an exothermic reaction (see Figure 2), which will release amounts of heat and increase
the local temperature, further contributing to the melting of the
lower-melting-point eutectic and resulting in the sticking of different
particles. The small liquid drops, in most of the time, will flow
into the pores formed in the earlier stage. Therefore, nonporous and
much larger MoO2 powder will be formed finally. The corresponding
reaction mechanism can be briefly described in Figure 13.

process of MoO3 to MoO2 by the CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases.

3.2 Kinetic Analyses
From the results
of Figure 3, it is
found that the total reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 by the CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases can be roughly
divided into two obvious parts according to the reaction extent, i.e.,
from 0 to 0.1111 and 0.1111 to 1. According to the XRD results shown
in Figures 6 and 7, however, it can be divided into three minor steps:
(1) from MoO3 to Mo9O26, (2) from
Mo9O26 to Mo4O11, and
(3) from Mo4O11 to MoO2. From the
kinetic curve results, it can be known that the last two stages (2
and 3) have no obvious demarcation point, so the kinetic analyses
are conducted based on the reaction extent. Herein, the model fitting
method is used, and the rate expressions of different gas–solid
reaction models are listed in refs (28−30).

3.2.1 From 0 to 0.1111
As can be seen
from Figure 10B, numerous
pores and cracks are generated on the surface of products, which are
beneficial for the diffusion of gases, so diffusion of gases could
not be the rate-controlling step. In addition, the nucleation and
growth process may also not be the rate-controlling step because of
the nearly linear kinetics curves. Therefore, the chemical reaction
between the interfaces of MoO3 and Mo9O26 should be considered. By attempting different models, it
is found that the chemical reaction model, as described by eq 12, can best fit the experimental
data, and the corresponding calculated results are shown in Figure 14. The slope of
each straight line determined the reaction rate constant, k (a function of temperature, as described by the Arrhenius
equation (see eq 13),
where A is the preexponential factor (min–1), ΔE is the activation energy (J/mol), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol K)), and T is the absolute temperature (K)), which increased with the increase
of reaction temperature 12   13  

Figure 14 Plot of reaction extent α vs reaction
time t (α in the range of 0–0.1111).

According to eq 13, one can easily obtain 14  Substituting different rate constants k obtained from Figure 14 into eq 14, the corresponding results can be obtained, as shown in Figure 15. From Figure 5 it can be observed
that the experimental data agree well with the Arrhenius equation,
which further suggests that reduction from MoO3 to Mo9O26 obeys the chemical reaction model in the temperature
range of 901–948 K. Moreover, an activation energy of 318.326
kJ/mol is extracted, and then the reaction extent α can be expressed
by eq 15 15  

Figure 15 Arrhenius plot for the reduction of MoO3 to Mo9O26.

3.2.2 From 0.1111 to 1
From Figure 10C, it can be found
that pores still existed in this period of time. As reaction proceeds,
pores gradually disappeared. Thereafter, many small liquid drops are
formed on the surface, which will hinder the diffusion of gases seriously.
However, according to the linear kinetics curves shown in Figure 3, it may be deduced
that chemical reaction is still the dominating rate-controlling step
(diffusion may also work in the very latter period). Similarly, it
is found that eq 12 can
also best fit the experimental data at the reaction extent between
0.1111 and 1 (from Mo9O26 to MoO2; herein, the last two steps are analyzed together due to the well
linear kinetic curves and no obvious demarcation point appears), as
shown in Figure 16. In the meantime, substituting different slopes obtained from Figure 16 into eq 14, the corresponding Arrhenius
plot can also be calculated, as displayed in Figure 17, from which activation energy of 112.047
kJ/mol is easily extracted. Therefore, the algebraic expression of
the reaction extent α in the range of 0.1111–1 can be
obtained as shown in eq 16 16  where t0 is the
time related to the reaction extent of 0.1111 at a desired temperature.

of reaction extent α vs reaction time t (α
in the range of 0.1111–1).

Figure 17 Arrhenius plot for the reduction of Mo9O26 to MoO2.

The activation energies extracted for the reduction
reaction from
MoO3 to Mo9O26 is much larger than
that from Mo9O26 to MoO2 (318.326
vs 112.047 kJ/mol), from which it may be mistaken for a lower reaction
rate in the former. However, from the kinetics curve (see Figure 3), it can be found
that the reaction rate in the range of 0–0.1111 is also very
fast, especially at higher temperatures. In this case, it can also
be observed that the preexponential factors obtained in the range
of 0–0.1111 is much larger than that obtained in the range
of 0.1111–1 (1.14 × 1016 vs 3.75 × 104), which indicates that the collision frequency in the primary
period is more intense and then improves the reaction rate in turn,
which is in good agreement with the kinetic compensation effect.31

4 Conclusions
In this work, reduction
of high-purity MoO3 with CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases is investigated by the nonisothermal
and isothermal thermogravimetric experiments. The following conclusions
can be drawn:1. Temperature has a significant influence
on the product composition: when the temperature is low, the main
product is MoO2; on increasing the reaction temperature,
the main product will turn to be Mo2C; on further increasing
the temperature (T > T4 = 1443 K), metallic Mo will be generated.

2. Reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 by the CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases is proceeded
following a three-step reaction processes with the formation of intermediate
products of Mo9O26 and Mo4O11. The reaction sequences of MoO3 → Mo9O26 → Mo4O11 → MoO2 are proposed.

3. The final products always keep the
same platelet shape and smooth morphology as the MoO3 raw
material. However, the particle size of products will be increased
due to the formation of lower-melting-point eutectic and the sticking
of particles.

4. The rate-controlling
step for the reduction
of MoO3 to Mo9O26 and Mo9O26 to MoO2 (mainly from Mo4O11 to MoO2) is both interfacial chemical reactions.
The extracted activation energies are 318.326 and 112.047 kJ/mol,
respectively.



5 Materials and Experimental Procedures
5.1 Materials
High-purity MoO3 purchased from Jinduicheng Molybdenum Co., Ltd., Xi′an, China,
was used for the experiments. Figure 18 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the studied
raw material. As can be easily seen, the material has a very high
purity without any impurities. The studied MoO3 powder
belongs to the thermodynamically stable orthorhombic phase, α-MoO3, which can also be deduced according to the information of
PDF card No. 5-508. The images of the raw materials are presented
in Figure 19, from which it can be known that the powders are composed
of many platelet-shaped particles with some small ones attached on
the smooth surface. In addition, most of the small particles are agglomerated
together with each other to form a big block.

5.2 Experimental Procedures
To monitor
the weight loss continuously during the reduction process, a thermal
analysis system (HTC-3, Beijing Hengjiu Instrument Ltd., Beijing),
which includes a thermogravimetry (TG) microbalance with a precision
of ±0.1 μg, was used. The corresponding schematic diagram
of the experimental apparatus is shown in the literature.18 To establish the potential isothermal experimental
temperatures, a series of nonisothermal thermogravimetry differential
thermal analysis (TG-DTA) experiments were carried out first. During
the nonisothermal experimental processes, about 40 mg of MoO3 powder was loaded into an alumina crucible (ϕ7 mm × 2
mm) and placed into a furnace. The CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed gases were then introduced into the reaction tube to drive
the air out before the furnace was heated from ambient temperature
(about 298 K) to 1550 K at different heating rates (5, 10, 15, and
20 K/min). When the temperature reached 1550 K, the furnace was cooled
down to room temperature again in the same gas atmosphere (CO–15
vol % CO2 mixed gases).

After establishing the potential
isothermal experimental temperatures according to the nonisothermal
TG-DTA curves, the isothermal experiments were conducted subsequently.
In each experimental run, about 40 mg of MoO3 powder was
filled into the alumina crucible and then placed in a flat temperature
zone of the furnace. Due to the stability of high-purity α-MoO3 at low temperature (α-MoO3 will not evaporate
or sublimate when the temperature is below 973 K),32,33 air gas was selected to be introduced into the system first. When
the furnace was heated from room temperature to the desired temperatures
(901, 916, 932, and 948 K) at a heating rate of 10 K/min, air gas
switched to the reducing gases (CO–15 vol % CO2 mixed
gases) to start the reduction reaction. After reacting for a suitable
period of time or completely, the furnace was cooled down to room
temperature again under the same gas atmosphere. The samples were
then collected for further characterization.

In all of the experimental
runs, a constant gas flow rate of 100
mL/min was maintained during the reaction process. CO–15 vol
% CO2 mixed gases were synthesized by Wuhan Minghui Gas
Technology. Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD;
D8 Advance, AXS Corporation, Bruker, Germany, Cu Kα filtered
radiation, and operated at 30 kV and 20 mA at a scanning speed of
10°/min) was used to identify the phase compositions. Field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Nova 400 NanoSEM, FEI Corporation,
and with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV) was used to observe the
evolution laws of product morphologies during the reduction processes.
