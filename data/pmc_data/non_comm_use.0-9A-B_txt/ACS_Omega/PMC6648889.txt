A new low-cost green electrochemical sensor based on nontoxic polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and silver nanoparticles was used to improve the sensitivity
of the carbon paste electrode for the investigation of olanzapine
(OLZ) in dosage arrangements and in the existence of its coadministered
drug fluoxetine and in the drug formulation. Scanning electron microscopy
measurements were carried out to emphasize the morphology of the electrode
surface. Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry were
used to explore the diffusion and linearity behaviors of OLZ. Impedance
spectroscopy measurements were determined to investigate the ac behavior
of OLZ and then an ideal electrical circuit was modeled. A linear
calibration was obtained from 1.0 × 10–8 to
1.25 × 10–4 M. The limit of detection was 1.5
× 10–9 M, whereas the limit of quantification
was 5 × 10–9 M. The way has been wholly authenticated
concerning linearity, precision, accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity,
and selectivity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Olanzapine (OLZ) is a first-line antipsychotic
medicine1 used for the dealing of schizophrenia
and depressive episodes connected with bipolar disorder [with fluoxetine
(FLX)].2 It has also been used as an antiemetic
for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.3 OLZ is a very active drug; so it is administered
at very low dosages;4 so very sensitive
analytical approaches are necessary for its determination. High-performance
liquid chromatography,5,6 capillary electrophoresis technique,7,8 and spectrophotometry9,10 were used for its determination.
Although electrochemical methods are sensitive techniques for drug
determination, only few works were done on OLZ using cyclic voltammetry
and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to explore the diffusion
behavior of OLZ at a glassy carbon electrode;11 a magnetic nanocomposite with a core–shell structure was
also used.12,13 OLZ was finally investigated in tablets and human urine samples
using a modified carbon paste sensor electrode incorporating gold
nanoparticles (NPs) and glutamine in a micellar medium 13 and with
a bilayer of multiwalled carbon nanotube/benzene disulfonate-doped
polypyrrole.14

Green chemistry is the design of processes that reduce or eliminate the illumination
of hazardous substances. It focuses on technological approaches to
prevent pollution and reduce consumption of nonrenewable resources.
Most of the important nonhazardous additive formulations used to control
the electrodeposition of metals include polyethylene glycols (PEGs).15 PEG is a nontoxic, commercially available polyether
which is used in clinical research.16 Many
procedures of PEG surface adjustment have been used to shrink a surface
protein resistant and to improve surface biocompatibility.17 PEG is passive to constituents of the cell environment
because they avoid adsorption of proteins. It has been used incorporated
with a carbon paste electrode (CPE) in several applications18,19 providing high sensitivity and selectivity.

Novel metallic
NPs, especially silver NP-modified sensors, show high electrocatalytic
activities toward the redox process because of their good conductivity.
Moreover, from the economic point of view the cost for preparation
of AgNPs is lower than that of Au and Pt NPs; also, silver is the
least toxic metal for humans, so it has been used in wide fields of
applications including as catalysts,20,21 as an antibacterial,22 as a biosensor,23 for bioimaging,24 and in chemical analysis.25

The aim of this work is to implement a
novel and simple sensor based on PEG and AgNPs to improve the sensitivity
and selectivity of OLZ. Then, the utility of the sensor for its quantitative
determination in the pharmaceutical formulation will be investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Surface Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of (A) bare CPE,
(B) CPE/PEG, and (C) CPE/PEG/AgNPs are presented in Figure 1. The CPE surface is uniform
and smooth, whereas the CPE/PEG surface shows large spherical holes.
At the CPE/PEG/AgNP surface, AgNPs appear spherical in shape, giving
a larger surface area than bare CPE. The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrograph (Figure 1D) shows spherical irregular distribution of AgNPs with an
average diameter of 22 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
of the CPE/PEG/AgNP sensor (Figure 1E) proves the presence of AgNPs on the surface at its
binding energy of 3 keV, whereas the elemental mapping (inset) shows
that silver NPs are arranged homogeneously and covering the whole
surface area. Also, the effect of changing the electrodeposition time
of silver was examined (Figure 1F). The increasing current response of OLZ toward the electrodeposition
time was monitored from 5 to 60 s, where a maximum peak of OLZ was
obtained when the electrodeposition time of silver was 40 s. The electron
transfer of OLZ was enhanced because the increase of AgNP concentration
on the PEG surface leads to an increase of the charge capacity; also,
the electrostatic attraction force between the positively charged
OLZ and the negatively charged AgNPs enhances the current values.
However, upon increasing the electrodeposition time to higher than
40 s, a drop in the OLZ current response was observed. This may be
attributed to the growth of AgNPs on the surface of the CPE/PEG that
blinds the sensor and hinders the charge transfer process.15,26

2.2 Electrochemical
Behavior of OLZ
A reversible oxidation process of 1.0 ×
10–3 M OLZ in McIlvaine (Mc) buffer, pH 2.2, at
a scan rate 50 mV·s–1 was recorded at bare
CPE, CPE/PEG, and CPE/PEG/AgNPs (Figure 2). It is clear that OLZ gives an anodic peak
current at +0.59 V when bare CPE is used because of the oxidation
of the amine group. However, CPE/PEG gives a higher oxidation peak
current, as it rises from 36.2 to 110.2 μA. Upon the addition
of AgNPs, it reaches 244.8 μA, because the capping agents of
PEG have the capability of stabiling
the newly formed AgNPs in the polymer matrix, which induce a larger
surface area.17,19 The oxidation mechanism of OLZ
at CPE/PEG/AgNPs is illustrated in Scheme 1.

of 1.0 × 10–3 mol L–1 of
OLZ in Mc buffer, pH 2, at a scan rate

and CPE/PEG/AgNPs.

2.3.1 Effect of pH
The
current response diagram of 1.0 × 10–3 M OLZ
in the Mc buffer with different pH values (2.2 → 8) at a scan
rate 100 mV·s–1 has been studied in Figure 3. OLZ is a weak base
with pKa values of 4.69 and 7.37. At a
pH higher than 7.37, there is no charge and the current intensity
is almost the same. A supreme oxidation current signal is reached
at pH 2.2 where OLZ is deliberated as a positively charged species
that interacts with the negatively deposited AgNPs, forming an ion-pair
onto the surface of the electrode.27,28 These results
indicate the effect of PEG and AgNPs on the catalytic oxidation processes.

of OLZ at different
pH values using CPE, CPE/PEG, and CPE/PEG/AgNPs.

2.3.2 Effect of Scanning
Speed
Studying the impact of scan rate on the electrochemical
oxidation of 1 × 10–3 M OLZ is presented using
CPE/PEG/AgNPs in Figure 4. A linear relationship between the square root of the scan rate
and the anodic current (inset A) between 10 and 300 mV·s–1 results in a linear equation: Ip (μA) = 13.95ν1/2 (V s–1)1/2 – 21.32 (n = 7, γ =
0.998), which implies that the oxidation process of OLZ is a diffusion-controlling
process.22 Also, the relation between the
log of the anodic peaks of OLZ with the log of the scan rate gives
a linear relationship with a slope of 0.641 (inset B), signifying
that OLZ oxidation is organized by diffusion with some adsorption
sustenance.

of 1.0 × 10–3 mol L–1 OLZ
at CPE/PEG/AgNPs in Mc buffer, pH 2, at: 10, 25, 50, 80, 100, 200,
and 300 mV·s–1. Inset (1): plot of the anodic
peak current values versus square root of the scan rate. Inset (2):
plot of the anodic peak potential values versus scan rate.

The surface area of CPE/PEG/AgNPs was evaluated
using 1.0 mM K3 Fe (CN)6 at different scan rates
based on the Randles–Sevcik equation29−32 1  

For K3Fe(CN)6, n =
1 and D = 7.6 × 10–6 cm2/s, the surface area of CPE/PEG/AgNPs was found to be 0.181
cm2. The diffusion coefficient of OLZ was calculated by
the same equation and was found to be 1.03 × 10–8 cm2 s–1.

2.4 EIS Study
Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopic (EIS) technique is used mainly to test the conductivity
of the modified electrode surface that is directly
proportional to the current and inversely
proportional to the impedance. EIS scans measured at the peak potential
(590 mV) for bare CPE, CPE/PEG, and CPE/PEG/AgNPs are shown in Figure 5 as Nyquist plots.
It shows a semicircle at high frequency, signifying a charge-transfer
process connected to a linear line at low frequency, indicating a
diffusion process.33 The diameter of the
semicircle rises in the order: bare CPE > CPE/PEG > CPE/PEG/AgNPs.
The Nyquist plots’ data were simulated with two time constants’
equivalent circuit (inset) with 2% error. Analysis was performed by
Thales software delivered with a Zahner-Electric workstation.34 The model consists of R1ZwC1 and R2C2 in series with the solution resistance (Rs). C1 and C2 are inner and outer layer capacitances; R1 and R2 are the respective internal and
external layer resistances. Zw is the
Warburg component linked to diffusion phenomena.35 Constant phase element (CPE)
is presented instead of ideal capacitance to validate the ideal behavior
and surface roughness. CPE is connected to an empirical exponent (α
= 0–1) to justify the surface inhomogeneity.36 Generally, the data show that upon adding PEG and AgNPs,
the oxidation of OLZ gives a lower impedance value (R1) of 16 kΩ cm2 (highest conductivity)
and the highest diffusion process (W = 611 Ω
cm2 s–1/2) compared to R1 = 153 kΩ cm2 and W = 187 Ω cm2 s–1/2 for the bare
CPE. Thus, the mechanism of the reaction depends on both charge-transfer
and diffusion processes, which confirms the CVs
and the scan rate calculations.

pH values. Inset: Nyquist plot of OLZ using bare CPE and CPE/PEG with
the equivalent circuit used in the fitting process.

3 Analytical Applications
3.1 Simultaneous Determination of OLA and FLX
The drug combination of OLZ with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor
FLX29 has no official method for their
determination. Thus, an interference study including FLX was performed
to test the selectivity of CPE/PEG/AgNPs. As shown in Figure 6), both OLA and FLX exhibit
a well-defined DPV with good separations in the Mc buffer, pH 7.4
(physiological pH of the body). As the safety doses above 18 mg of
OLZ with 75 mg of FLX have not been estimated in clinical trials,
the projected modified electrode can discriminate OLZ from FLX, by
changing the concentration of both, OLZ (2 → 18 mg/mL) and
FLX (5 → 75 mg/mL). The current comebacks due to the oxidation
of OLA (at 260 mV) and FLX (at 450 mV) with a peak separation of 190
mV were observed, giving good calibration curves for both drugs (inset).
This indicates the electrocatalytic activity of OLZ and FLX in the
presence of each other.

Figure 6 DPV obtained
for the OLZ and FLX mixture on CPE/PEG/AgNPs using Mc buffer by changing
the concentration of both of them after subtracting the background
current.

3.2 Calibration Curve and Detection Limit
The current intensity
of the developed sensor in Mc buffer, pH 2.2, with a scan rate of
10 mV s–1 using DPV at CPE/PEG/AgNPs increased linearly
with OLZ in the range of 1.0 × 10–8 to 1.25
× 10–4 M (Figure 7) with a regression equation of Ip (μA) = 0.209c (μM) + 1.242
and a correlation coefficient equal to 0.9961. The limit of detection
(LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were calculated using the
following equations: LOD = 3s/m and
LOQ = 10s/m,37,38 where s is the standard deviation and m is the
slope of the calibration curves, and were established to be 1.5 ×
10–9 M and 5 × 10–9 M, respectively.

using differential
pulse modes at CPE/PEG/AgNPs using Mc buffer (pH 2) and scan rate

subtracting the background current.

3.3 Analysis of OLZ Tablets
Five tablets were balanced and the average mass per tablet was
determined. Four aliquots of the drug solution were introduced and
the standard addition method was carried out. The recovery and relative
standard deviation are provided in Table 1. The outcomes suggested that CPE/PEG/AgNPs
have high reproducibility and that the auxiliary materials in tablets
have no vital interferences for the samples analyzed.

3.4 Stability and Robustness of the
Modified Electrode
The stability of the electrochemical sensor
was tested by recording cyclic voltammograms of OLZ in Mc buffer,
pH 2.2. After 50 successive scans, the anodic peak currents at CPE/PEG/AgNPs
decreased by 3.3%. This indicates that the AgNP film formed is mechanically
stable. The immobilization of AgNPs into the polymeric matrix through
the hydrophobic part of the surfactant avoids the movement of the
NPs out of the polymer structure, which leads to the nonmechanical
alteration of the polymer matrix that maintains the stability of the
sensor. These results prove the reliability of the proposed method
for the determination of OLZ so it can be considered robust.

4 Conclusions
A
novel nontoxic carbon paste sensor with an excellent performance for
the sensitive electrochemical determination of OLZ based on ethylene
glycol polymer and silver NPs was prepared. The proposed methods have
the advantage of using feasible analytical procedures and the electrode
exhibits good sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility for OLZ
determination in pure and dosage form with an LOD value of 1.5 ×
10–9 M, whereas the LOQ was 5 × 10–9 M. The analytical procedure has been fully validated regarding linearity,
precision, accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, and selectivity.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials and Reagents
OLZ was kindly supplied from Eipico, Egypt; PEG and AgNO3 were purchased from sigma. Mc buffer is a buffer solution prepared
in the pH range from 2.2 to 8.0 by mixing 0.2 M disodium hydrogen
phosphate and 0.1 M citric acid.

5.1.1 Preparation of Bare CPE
CPE was arranged by collaborating
graphite powder (0.5 g) with drops of nujol oil in a glassy mortar.
The carbon paste was filled into the hole of the electrode and pressed
on a filter paper.

5.1.2 Preparation of the Modified CPE
PEG (5 μL) was
added on the surface of the CPE and left to dry for 10 min, and the
electrode was completely rinsed with water to remove the unadsorbed
polymer and dried in air at room temperature to form CPE/PEG. Then,
the electrode was immersed in 1.0 × 10–3 M
AgNO3 solution containing 1.0 × 10–4 M NH4NO3. Electrodeposition of AgNPs was carried
out under −0.2 V for 40 s, followed by gentle washing with
double-distilled deionized water to form CPE/PEG/AgNPs (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 5.2 Instrumental and Experimental
Setup
All voltammetric and impedance measurements were achieved
by the three-electrode electrochemical workstation EC-Lab SP-150 potentiostat.
A platinum wire serves as the auxiliary electrode and the calomel
as the reference electrode. SEM tests were achieved by SEM Model Quanta
250 FEG (field emission gun) committed with an EDX unit, with accelerating
voltage of 30 kV, magnification 14 up to 1 000 000 (FEI
company, the Netherlands).

5.3 Validation in Pharmaceutical Samples
Ten tablets of
the commercial pharmaceutical olazine
(10 mg/tablet) were weighed, powdered, and dissolved in deionized
water and the average mass per tablet was determined to obtain the
concentration of OLA
in the working range and then DPV was recorded with the following
parameters: scan rate of 10 mV·s–1, pulse width
of 25 ms, pulse period of 200 ms, and pulse amplitude of 10 mV, using
CPE/PEG/AgNPs with the standard addition technique.
