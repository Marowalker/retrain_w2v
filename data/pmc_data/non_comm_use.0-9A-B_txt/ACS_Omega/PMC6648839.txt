This
study aims to develop an intermolecular lactonization reaction
of alkenes with carbonyls mediated by visible light and molecular
iodine. The one-step reaction involved the carboesterification of
alkenes to produce the corresponding lactones in moderate to good
yield. It was also revealed that it is possible to control the diastereoselectivity
of the reaction by altering the base used and the reaction conditions.
When water was added as a solvent, the reaction resulted in the formation
of lactones with trans-selectivity. A mechanistic investigation was
undertaken and it was found that the reaction requires the generation
of an iodine radical from molecular iodine, driven by visible light
irradiation, and proceeds via the formation of an iodine radical alkene
adduct. The proposed reaction is an example of a rare-metal free intermolecular
addition cyclization reaction, which is an environment-friendly chemical
process that only uses molecular iodine. In addition, since diastereoselectivity
was observed without the use of any specific reagents, the developed
methodology is an example of a novel stereoselective transformation
using only cost-effective reagents.

Introduction
Oxygen-containing 5-membered
ring systems such as γ-lactones
are found in naturally occurring products and pharmaceuticals and
are commonly used as building blocks in various fields of chemistry.1,2 Traditionally, the lactone skeleton is constructed through the intramolecular
condensation reaction of a hydroxycarboxylic acid under Brønsted/Lewis
acidic and thermal conditions (Scheme 1, top).3−6 However, this methodology is not suitable for the synthesis of some
derivatives. Toward this aim, the intermolecular diversity-oriented
synthesis of lactones has been developed.7 For example, a [3 + 1] type intermolecular cycloaddition reaction
based on the generation of carbon radicals using a strong single-electron
reductant such as SmI2 was reported by Fukuzawa and Procter
(Scheme 1, middle).8 Furthermore, various intermolecular [2 + 2] type
reactions such as the C–C/C–O bond formation of an alkene
with an acetyl unit have also been investigated. Among them is a common
and powerful method based on the generation of carbon radicals in
a one-electron oxidation process using heavy metals (Scheme 1, bottom).9,10 Recently,
a methodology using photo-redox catalysts has also been developed.11 However, in intermolecular reactions, it is
difficult to control the diastereoselectivity by changing only the
reaction conditions, and only a few examples of this have been reported
in the literature.12

Scheme 1 Reported Methodology
for Lactone Synthesis
Previously, we developed the iodine/visible light-mediated
carboesterification
of styrene using carbonyls that led to the formation of cis-lactones through the photoinduced generation of an iodine radical
as the key active species (Scheme 2; previous work).13,14 Over the course
of this study, it was found that the opposite diastereomer could be
formed without the use of any specific reagent by simply controlling
the reaction conditions. In particular,
it was effective for priory to trans-selectivity when water was added
as a solvent. Herein, the trans-selective synthesis of γ-lactones
is described via visible light/iodine-mediated intermolecular carboesterification
of styrenes with carbonyls (Scheme 2; this work). A mechanistic investigation using stereochemical
models is also described.

Scheme 2 Schematic Overview of the trans-Diastereoselective
Synthesis of Lactones in This Work
Results and Discussion
Previous studies have shown
that using Ca(OH)2 as a
base in combination with molecular iodine in the presence of alkenes
and malonates always affords products with cis-diastereoselectivity
as a result of an addition/cyclization process (Table 1, entry 1).15 Therefore,
to develop a stereoselective iodine/visible light-mediated alkene
carboesterification reaction that can be applied to carbonyls, various
inorganic bases were explored. Upon screening of alkaline earth metal-based
inorganic bases in the reaction of styrene 1a with malonate 2a in the presence of molecular iodine, the formation of cis-diastereomer 3aa-cis preferentially
occurred when Ba(OH)2 was used (entry 3). Unfortunately,
the reaction significantly decreased the yield of the product when
the reaction employed other alkaline earth metal bases (entries 2,
4–6). On the other hand, upon the evaluation of alkaline metal-based
inorganic bases, such as NaHCO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, Cs2CO3, and
K3PO4, a slight preference for the formation
of trans-diastereomer 3aa-trans was observed (entries 7–12). The basicity of the base used
was found to have a strong effect on the yield of product 3aa. For instance, the intermolecular addition reaction of styrene with
malonate resulted in a significant decrease in the yield of the product
in the presence of a weak base, such as NaHCO3 (entry 7).
In contrast, the desired lactonization and hydrolysis of the ester
proceeded competitively in the presence of strong bases, such as KOH
and K3PO4 (entries 11 and 12). Gratifyingly,
when using Na2CO3, a further variation in the
reaction conditions resulted in 3aa-trans being generated in 69% yield with 25:75 diastereoselectivity (entry
13). Under the optimal conditions, further base screening was performed.
Interestingly, the reaction in tBuOH with
water resulted in an increase in trans-diastereoselectivity
(entries 13–17), and even more interestingly, inverse diastereoselectivity
was observed using bases such as Ca(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, and Sr(OH)2 under the same conditions (entry 1,3,4 vs
14–16).

a Reaction conditions: 1a (2 equiv), 2a (0.3
mmol), I2 (0.3 mmol),
and base (0.3 mmol) in solvent (3 mL) were stirred at ambient temperature
irradiated with four of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for 20 h.

b Diasteromeric ratios (dr) were
determined
by 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

After the optimization study, the
scope of the trans-diastereoselective synthesis of
lactones was investigated by making
2-methyl dimethyl malonate 2a to react with a series
of alkenes, 1 (Table 2). Generally, the controllable carboesterification
reactions furnished trans-butyrolactones with good
diastereoselectivities in the presence of water as a co-solvent. At
first, trans-selective lactonization was investigated using Na2CO3 as a base under the optimized reaction conditions
(Table 1, entry 13).
Most of the reactions proceeded smoothly using the developed system
to afford the corresponding butyrolactones 3 in good
yield and trans-diastereoselectivity. As shown in Table 2, styrenes with various
substituents, such as tert-butyl, 4-methyl, 3-methyl,
and 2-methylstyrene (1b–1e), gave
products in 61–72% isolated yield with moderate to good trans-diastereoselectivity. In addition, styrenes bearing
halogen substituents (1f–1h) also
furnished the desired products. The stereochemical assignments were
corroborated using single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the
obtained trans-3ha adduct.16 Unfortunately, methyl-4-vinylbenzoate, 1i, did not work under the present conditions, even though
good conversion could be achieved using a set of previous cis-selective
conditions.13 This is probably due to the
instability of the ester under these conditions. Electron-rich substrates
such as 1j also did not react with malonate due to the
rapid polymerization of styrene.17

a Diasteromeric ratios (dr) were determined
by 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

The biphenyl 1k, 2-naphthyl 1l, and 2-pyridyl 1m derivatives were also found
to be good substrates, resulting
in the formation of trans-3ka, trans-3la, and trans-3ma in moderate to good yield with good diastereomeric ratios.
Finally, the reaction of aliphatic substrates, such as undecene 1n with malonate 2a, proceeded to give product 3na in moderate yield. The diastereoselectivity did not decrease
compared with other aromatic alkenes, gave trans-3na with good dr.

These reaction conditions for the
iodine/visible light-mediated
carboesterification of alkenes were then applied to the reaction of
malonate 2a with disubstituted styrenes (1o–1r) (Scheme 3). The combination of α-methylstyrenes, 1o, with malonate 2a resulted in the formation
of products in 61% yield with moderate diastereoselectivity. When cis (Z)-1p and trans-β-methylstyrene (E)-1p were
used, the products 3pa were synthesized with the same
diastereoselectivity regardless of the styrene isomer.18 Indene 1q afforded polycyclic lactone trans-3qa with excellent diastereoselectivity
by 9:91. Also, the use of 1,1-diphenylethylene resulted in the formation
of product 3ra in moderate yield.

Scheme 3 trans-Diastereoselective Synthesis of Lactones, 3, via the
Reaction of Disubstituted Alkenes with Malonate 2a
Diasteromeric ratios (dr) were
determined by 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

To further evaluate the reaction scope, the optimal
conditions
for the trans-diastereoselective synthesis of lactones
were used in the reaction of styrene 1a with various
carbonyls 2 (Scheme 4). The desired trans-lactones 3aa, 3ab, 3ac, and 3ad were obtained in moderate to good yield with diastereoselectivities
ranging between ca. 2:1 and 5:1. Interestingly, carbonyl bearing benzyl
group 2c gave cis-3ac lactone
preferentially. The formation of trans-3ac was suppressed due to the steric repulsion between the phenyl group
of styrene and benzyl group (see the cyclization mechanism details, Scheme 10). In addition,
when the reaction used triester 2e, it resulted in the
formation of lactone 3ae albeit in low yield. To probe
other substituents, the ester substituent group was changed. Expectedly, the reaction using tert-butoxy ester 2f, it is possible to interfere with nucleophilic attack because
of bulky ester could not be obtained the lactone 3af.
When acetyl derivative 2g was used as a substrate, the
desired product 3ag was obtained in moderate yield.

Diasteromeric ratios (dr) were
determined by 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

To test the scalability of the reactions, gram-scale
reactions
using malonate 2a and styrene 1a were performed
under both sets of cis-13 and trans-selective
conditions (Scheme 5). When scaled up in size by 30 times to 9 mmol, the reactions under
both sets of conditions proceeded as expected to afford 63 and 81%
isolated yields, respectively.

Scheme 5 Scale-up of the Intermolecular Lactonization
Reactions
Mechanistic Investigations
To gain mechanistic insight
into the reactions, several control experiments were carried out.
Initially, the role of visible light in the reaction was investigated
(Scheme 6). As previously
reported, we hypothesized that the iodine radical was formed by irradiating
molecular iodine with visible light.19 Indeed,
the yield of 3aa was found to greatly decrease to 24%
under dark conditions shielded with aluminum foil sheets. Also, since
the reaction could be significantly suppressed in the dark at room
temperature, the heat from compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs did
not affect the reaction. In addition, 3aa was obtained
in a significantly lower yield under heating conditions at 70°.
These results indicate that iodine was not thermally activated and
that visible light activation of molecular iodine is necessary for
the reaction to proceed.

Scheme 6 Investigation into the Role of Visible Light
in the Reaction
The iodonium cation
is one of the reactive species that can be
generated by the reaction of molecular iodine or cationic iodine with
alkenes without being irradiated with visible light.19,20 This means that the reaction may proceed via an iodonium intermediate,
whereby an alkene is electrophilically activated by cationic iodine.21 Therefore, we investigated the role of iodine
in the reaction (Scheme 7). When reactions were carried out using a cationic iodine source,
such as NIS or (lutidine)2I+BF4–, instead of molecular iodine under standard reaction
conditions,22 a significant decrease in
the yield of 3aa was observed. Interestingly, the formation
of the iodoalkoxylation product 4a was observed in some
cases. This product is thought to be generated through the solvolysis
of an iodonium cation intermediate.23 However,
2 equiv of NIS produced a similar yield of the product. These observations
revealed that alkene was not predominantly activated by a cationic
form of iodine to form an iodonium intermediate.

Scheme 7 Reactions Using a
Cationic Iodine Source
To determine the key intermediate, the reaction was conducted
under
an oxygen atmosphere (Scheme 8, eq 1). Acetophenone 5a was formed by dehalogenation
of phenacyl iodide,19a,24 which was generated by the photooxidation
of styrene via sequential addition of the iodine radical and triplet
oxygen to styrene.25 To further investigate,
we then attempted radical clock experiments (Scheme 8, eq 2). As a result, using 1-cyclopropyl-1-phenylethylene
as a radical clock instead of styrene 1a under general
conditions, the ring-opened products I and II were obtained significantly under visible light irradiation from
CFL bulbs. In addition, it is indicated that the iodinated compound I was almost entirely consumed to form the nucleophilic substitution
product II under visible light irradiation. Thus, these
observations indicate that an iodine radical intermediate was generated
and this radical sequentially reacted with an alkene to form a diiodide
intermediate.

Scheme 8 Controlled Experiments to Elucidate the Nature of
the Radical Intermediate
To confirm the formation of the above-mentioned diiodo
intermediate,
reactions employing cis- or trans-stilbene (Z)-1s and (E)-1s were conducted (Table 3). Under a set of cis-selective conditions,
the reaction employing both stilbenes gave four possible diastereomers
in moderate yield with diastereomeric ratios of approximately 50:10:20:20,
respectively (entries 1 and 2).26 Furthermore,
a similar diastereomeric ratio was observed under a set of trans-selective
conditions (entries 3 and 4). For both sets of conditions, it was
revealed that lactones 3-A–D were produced with
similar diastereoselectivity without any influence from the structure
of the stilbene itself. Therefore, it was observed that the reaction
proceeded via a common intermediate, which could be the diiodo intermediate,
as hypothesized previously.13

b Diasteromeric ratios (dr) were determined
by 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture.

On the basis of the results of these
investigations, a tentative
mechanism is proposed in Scheme 9. Molecular iodine and the iodine radical are in equilibrium
under visible light irradiation and the generated radical is sequentially
added to styrene to yield II. vic-Diiodoalkanes, II, when generated in situ, are generally unstable and tend
to revert back to iodine and the original alkene.27 In the absence of water, compound II reacts
with malonate 2a to afford the corresponding product III and produces lactone 3 by the subsequent
cyclization reaction. In the presence of water, compound III reacts with water to afford the corresponding product IV. Finally, cyclization of compound III or IV produces the desired lactone, 3.

Scheme 9 Plausible Mechanism
of the Intermolecular Lactonization
As previously described, we were able to successfully
determine
the reaction conditions that allowed the control of diastereoselectivity
(in the absence of water and using Ca(OH)2 as base resulted
in the formation of cis-isomers, and in the presence of water and
using Na2CO3 as the base produced the opposite
isomer). We then elucidated the stereo determining step. Two types
of cyclization mechanisms can be considered, as shown in Scheme 10; route I: cyclization by the nucleophilic substitution reaction
from a lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen of the malonate (SN1 or SN2) and route II: cyclization from the hydroxy group,
which is generated as a result of the hydrolysis of the iodinated
intermediate. A reaction employing 18O-labeled H218O was conducted to evaluate the preferred route (Scheme 10, eqs 3 and 4).
As a result, 18O-labeled 3aa′ was mainly
generated in good yield with moderate trans-selectivity in both cases.28 Therefore, this indicates that the cyclization
reaction mainly proceeds via the route II mechanism in the presence
of water.

Scheme 10 Experiments of the Mechanism of Cyclization with H218O
On the basis of these investigations, the plausible cyclization
mechanism and stereo determination are proposed in Scheme 11. Since cyclization is mainly
through route I, the product gives the cis-isomer. This is because
the less sterically hindered carbonyl oxygen O1 attacks
the anti-bonding orbital of the C–I bond or carbocation to
avoid steric repulsion of the phenyl group (or substituent R) between
the ester. Furthermore, the cis-selectivity appears remarkably when
Ca(OH)2 is used13 (Table 1, entry 1), it is
conceivable that the metal cation forms chelate with two esters and
contributes to the improvement of cis-selectivity by controlling the
free rotation of esters.29

Scheme 11 Plausible
Cyclization Mechanism and Base Effect
On the other hand, it is considered that cyclization in
trans-selective
conditions, using water as a co-solvent, proceeds mainly according
to route II. Thus, a trans-diastereomer was obtained
when cyclization proceeds through the hydroxy group to carbonyl C1 having a small interference with the phenyl (or substituent
R) and another ester.

Conclusions
In this study, we have
reported the visible light-iodine-mediated trans-diastereoselective
synthesis of γ-lactones using
a broad range of alkenes and carbonyls. The molecular iodine used
in the reaction is cost-effective, easy to handle, and can be easily
removed from the reaction mixture. The selective synthesis of trans-isomer
was controlled using water as the co-solvent. Furthermore, the selective
formation routes of cis- and trans-isomers are identified. Notably,
this method does not require any co-catalyst/reagent. 16 terminal
alkenes and 5 internal alkenes were converted to the corresponding
lactones under visible light irradiation from CFL bulbs in yields
of up to 77% with moderate to good diastereoselectivity. Additionally,
7 lactones were prepared from various carbonyls with moderate to good
diastereoselectivity.

(86 mg, 2.0 equiv, 0.60 mmol) in tButyl
alcohol (2.0 mL) and H2O (1.0 mL) was degassed three times
via FPT cycling and backfilled with Ar. The resulting solution was
stirred at ambient temperature for 2 h. The reaction was quenched
with sat. aq Na2S2O3 and extracted
with Et2O (10 mL × 3). The combined organic layers
were washed with brine, dried over Mg2SO4, filtered
and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting mixture was purified by flash

Furthermore, we investigated that the influences
on stereoselectivity under general condition (see Table 1, entry 13), by reducing 3a–I instead of plausible intermediate IV in Scheme S3. Because this reaction
is considered equally of Route II cyclization reaction, it expected
when N- or K-selectride as reducing agent, the product 3aa gave trans-isomer selectivity. Since the diastereoselectivity
is equally to general condition and H218O experiment
(see Scheme 10), the
stereo determination of trans-isomer would depend
on the cyclization from intermediate IV.
