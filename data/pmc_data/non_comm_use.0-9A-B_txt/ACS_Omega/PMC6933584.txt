With the aim to easily recover and reuse the catalyst, an efficient
amino alcohol catalyst previously tested in the asymmetric addition
of diethylzinc to several aromatic aldehydes has been immobilized
on proper functionalized superparamagnetic core–shell magnetite–silica
nanoparticles and employed in the Henry reaction in the semi-homogeneous
phase. The nanocatalyst exhibits a promising catalytic activity that
remains unchanged in the three catalytic cycles performed. The results
prove that highly efficient catalysts, by being immobilized on suitable
magnetic nanosupports, can be easily recovered and reused, maintaining
their catalytic behavior.

Introduction
The nitroaldol or Henry reaction is a classical and powerful method
to form carbon–carbon bond with the production of a new stereogenic
center under mild conditions. The coupling of the nucleophile generated
from a nitroalkane with a carbonyl electrophile leads to the formation
of a β-nitroalcohol, a versatile intermediate that can easily
undergo further transformations such as oxidation, reduction, and
dehydration.1 Considering the potential
of the intermediate obtained, several studies have been directed toward
the development of asymmetric catalysts for the Henry reaction;2 a variety of catalysts have been employed, such
as metal-based catalysts,3−6 organocatalysts,7,8 and enzymes.9

β-amino alcohol motif is typical of numerous chiral auxiliaries,
ligands, and catalysts used in asymmetric synthesis;10 nevertheless, only few examples of their use in the Henry
reaction can be found in the literature. A noteworthy example is the
catalyst reported by Palomo et al.,11 which
generally provides more than 90% ee, using N-methylephedrine
(45%), Zn(OTf)2 (30%), iPrNEt2 (30%), and low temperatures. More recently, it has been reported
that the employment of 2-amino-1,2-diphenylethanol derivatives, forming
a chiral complex with CuII salts, provides the addition
of nitromethane to a variety of aldehydes with more than 90% ee.12,13

Even if asymmetric catalysis represents a powerful method for the
synthesis of enantiopure molecules, its practical applications are
extremely limited by the high costs and the severe ecological impact;
therefore, the opportunity to recover and reuse the catalysts become
a very important factor. The heterogenization of the catalyst facilitates
its separation14 and potentially allows
its recycling,15,16 but unfortunately, the immobilization
of chiral catalysts often results in lower activities and enantioselectivities.
Recently, the use of magnetic nanoparticles led to the development
of new catalysts that combine advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous
catalysis; nanoparticles, owing to the high surface area to volume
ratio, can be used as supports for asymmetric catalysts, with resulting
activities close to the homogeneous ones. Specifically, nanoparticles
of magnetite 10–20 nm in size exhibit a special form of magnetism,
called superparamagnetism,17,18 which allows them to
be extremely dispersible in solvents in the absence of an external
magnetic field and to overcome the recovery step by means of an agile
magnetic decantation.

So far, only few examples of an asymmetric magnetic nanoparticle-supported
amino alcohol catalyst have been reported.19,20 With the aim to develop a novel versatile, magnetically recoverable,
and recyclable nanocatalyst, we have focused on the design and synthesis
of β-amino alcohol ligands bearing, in addition to a fine-tunable
catalytic site, a functionality (an alkoxysilane group) for their
covalent anchoring to magnetite nanoparticles (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Anchoring strategy.

Before preparing supported nanoparticles, we tested the catalytic
activity and enantioselectivity of free ligands 2 with
a total length comparable to 1. Earlier studies21 proved that ligand 2a led to the
best results in the asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to several
aromatic aldehydes (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Catalytic activity of ligand 2a.

Herein, we report the results of the employment in the Henry reaction
both of the homogeneous amino alcohol ligand 2a and of
its immobilized form onto superparamagnetic core–shell magnetite–silica
nanoparticles.

Results and Discussion
Optimization of the Reaction Conditions
Initially,
the conditions were optimized in the reaction of nitromethane with
2-chlorobenzaldehyde in the presence of the chiral ligand 2a. On the basis of literature data, the solvent, catalyst loading,
and metallic salt were varied, that is, the reaction test was performed
in diethyl ether, dichloromethane, ethanol, and 2-propanol with an
amount of catalyst between 2.5 and 20% and employing copper acetate
or several zinc salts. As inferable from Table 1, the employment of diethyl ether and 2-propanol
led to a marked increase in efficiency, the first being slightly more
efficient in enantioselectivity while the second in the chemical yield.
Regarding metallic salt, zinc dramatically lowered the yields (entries
7–9), although the good results previously obtained21 suggested an efficient coordination to ligand 2a.

isolated compounds.

Finally, catalyst loading was found to have a significant effect
on the enantioselectivities, as 10 mol % catalyst loading produced
the highest value both in terms of yields (80%) and ee (75%) (entry
4).

Having concluded the condition optimization process, the reaction
was carried out with a variety of aromatic aldehydes with the purpose
of studying the catalyst’s efficiency relative to different
ring substituents. All the substrates were treated with nitromethane,
10% ligand, and 10% Cu(OAc)2 in diethyl ether or 2-propanol
for 72 h at room temperature.

As reported in Table 2, in spite of the encouraging results obtained with 2- chlorobenzaldehyde,
all the aldehydes tested in diethyl ether showed mediocre yields,
around 30% (except for entry 3) and generally weak enantiomeric excesses,
except for 2-methoxybenzaldehyde (93%, entry 4) and 3-methylbenzaldehyde
(89%, entry 8).

Table 2 Henry Reaction Catalyzed by Ligand 2a
a Chemical yields are referred to
isolated compounds.

b Experiment performed at −20
°C.

On the contrary, all the aldehydes tested in 2-propanol were converted
in good yields for both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
substituents on the ring and, in some cases, with slightly higher
values of enantiomeric excesses than those obtained with diethyl ether.

In order to increase the enantioselectivity, we performed the reaction
at −20 °C on 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, which had shown, at
room temperature, a very high yield but only good ee. Unfortunately,
the moderate improvement of the ee obtained in this test was not balanced
by an acceptable yield, as that dropped from 91 to 20% (entries 12
and 13).

Afterward, we started studying the diastereoselectivity of ligand 2a in the Henry reaction by reacting o-tolylbenzaldehyde,
which had produced the best result of those reported in Table 2, with nitroethane (Figure 3). It resulted in
the 83% conversion of the starting aldehyde into the two diastereoisomers 5a and 5b in a 1:1 ratio, the stereochemistry
of each being assigned by comparison with reported NMR spectra.22 The enantioselectivities were very different
for the two isomers, as 5a was obtained in 75% ee, while 5b in 45% ee.

Figure 3 Henry reaction using nitroethane and 2-methylbenzaldehyde catalyzed
by ligand 2a.

It is assumed that a nitroaldol reaction using a metal-based catalyst
predominantly affords the syn product likely because
a cyclic transition state is involved,23 in which both the nitronate and the aldehyde coordinate to one metal
cation. Since the authors supposed that a steric hindrance enhancement
favors the syn diastereoselectivity, we performed
the nitroethane addition using a bulkier aldehyde, that is, cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde.
Effectively, products 6a and 6b were collected
in an excellent diastereomeric ratio (88:12),24 with good yields and enantioselectivities (Figure 4).

by ligand 2a.

Ligand Immobilization onto Nanoparticles
Having extensively
explored different anchoring strategies, different functionalities
necessary for the bond with the surface, and different suitable spacers,
the nanostructured catalyst 7 was designed (Figure 5) (22). The most important modification
of catalyst 2a is the introduction of an aromatic and
a triazole ring through a CuI-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition
(CuAAC)25 and a magnetic nanoparticle functionalized
for anchoring the catalyst. We decided to employ nanoparticles with
a magnetite (Fe3O4) core coated with a thin
silica (SiO2) layer; the silica shell is reported to preserve
the inner Fe3O4 from oxidation by air to prevent
the tendency to agglomerate and be easily functionalizable, owing
to the many silanol groups exposed on the surface (Figure 5).26

Figure 5 Immobilization strategy for catalyst 7.

Before immobilizing the new ligand onto the nanoparticles, an analogue
of catalyst 7, catalyst 14 (Scheme 2), was evaluated in a homogeneous
phase catalysis test to verify that the introduced aromatic and triazole
groups would not affect the catalytic properties.

To this purpose, the alkyne 8 was synthesized in three
steps starting from the acid precursor 10. First, the
acid group underwent the condensation with the commercial tyramine
to form the amide 11. The hydroxyl group of the tyramine
moiety was then alkylated with propargyl bromide, and finally, the
oxirane ring underwent the opening reaction leading to the anchorable
precursor 8 in good yield (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Preparation of the Anchorable Precursor 8
We performed a click reaction with the (3-azidopropyl)benzene 13(27) in the original conditions28 with CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate in
a THF/H2O mixture. However, the cycloaddition reaction
product 14 was collected in a very low yield (26%) probably
due to low solubility of the substrate 8. Consequently,
we modified the procedure in order to improve the yields using cuprous
iodide as the copper source, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as the base, and tetrahydrofuran (THF)
as the solvent. In these conditions, we obtained the catalyst 14 with a yield of 89% (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Preparation of Catalyst 14
Ligand 14 was then evaluated in the homogeneous phase
catalysis test.

Data collected (Table 3) confirmed the range of yields and enantioselectivities obtained
with the previous ligand tested in this reaction (ligand 2a).

a Chemical yields are referred to

Having confirmed the retained catalytic activity, we immobilized 8 onto azido-modified magnetic nanoparticles 9a and 9b, the latter obtained after treating 9a with hexamethyldisilazane. This is often used as a silylating agent,
especially for silica, as it transforms the hydroxyl groups on the
nanoparticle surface into trimethylsilyloxide, leaving a nonpolar
surface.29 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images of 7b are
shown in Figure 6a,b,
respectively. The nanoparticle diameter is around 20 nm (Figure 6a). In Figure 6b, it is possible to distinguish
lattice fringes of the magnetic phase.

Figure 6 (a) TEM and (b) HR-TEM images of catalyst 7b.

The superparamagnetic catalysts 7a and 7b were thus obtained with 0.28 and 0.41 mmol/g, loading respectively.
The loading was determined considering the N w/w % values found by
elemental analyses. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
in fact (Figure S54) show the disappearance
of the azido group absorption of 9a and 9b, indicating a quantitative click reaction; in this way, the N w/w
% value is diagnostic for the loading as it can be totally related
to the organic moiety of 7a and 7b (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Preparation of 7a and 7b
The new superparamagnetic amino alcohol catalysts 7a and 7b were finally evaluated in the addition of nitromethane
to benzaldehyde. As reported in Table 4, while 7a led to mediocre values of yields
and ee (entries 1 and 2), far more encouraging results came from the
silylated catalyst 7b, leading to yields and enantioselectivities
totally comparable to those obtained in the homogeneous phase reported
in Table 3. This different
behavior could be attributed to the better dispersibility of 7b in 2-propanol due to both the silyl ethers on the nanoparticle
surface and the higher loading. Moreover, the catalytic activity remained
unchanged in the three catalytic cycles performed (entries 3–5).

Conclusions
With the final aim to develop a new versatile recoverable and recyclable
“nanocatalytic” system, we designed 7a and 7b, the immobilized version of 2a, already successfully
used in the asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to a variety of aldehydes.
We tested the ligand 2a in the asymmetric Henry reaction;
the high yields and the good ee suggest a fairly good copper coordination
ability of the ligand 2a. The immobilized version 7b exhibited a promising catalytic activity that remained
unchanged in the three catalytic cycles performed.

The preliminary results prove that highly efficient catalysts can
be easily recovered and reused by being immobilized on suitable nanosupports.
In light of the encouraging reported results, we are currently investigating
the catalytic efficiency of 2a and its immobilized analogues 7a and 7b in other asymmetric reactions and in
the synthesis of molecules of pharmaceutical interest.

Experimental Section
Unless otherwise stated, commercial reagents purchased from Alfa
Aesar, Acros, and Aldrich chemical companies were used without further
purification. Purification of reaction products was carried out by
flash chromatography using Kiesegel F Merck silica gel (230–400
mesh). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Kiesegel F
254 pre-coated silica gel plates, and visualization was achieved by
inspection under UV light (Mineralight UVG 11254 nm) followed by staining
with phosphomolybdic acid dip [polyphosphomolybdic acid (12 g) and
ethanol (250 mL)] or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine dip [2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
dip (4 g), ethanol (100 mL), water (20 mL), and sulfuric acid]. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury 300 (75
MHz) or a Bruker Avance 400 (100 MHz). Chemical shifts (δ) are
reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the internal standard
of a residue solvent peak, chloroform (77.00 ppm). Optical rotations
were measured on a digital polarimeter (Jasco DIP-370) with a cell
path length of 1 cm; solution concentrations are reported in grams
per 100 mL. Enantiomeric excesses were determined by way of an Agilent
1260 Infinity HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (DAD)
and a chiral stationary phase; chiral columns used were Chiralpak
IA, Chiralpak IB, and Chiralpack IC.

Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu IR Prestige-21. Elemental analyses
for C, H, and N were performed on an EA 1110 CHNS-O element analyzer.
Morphologic and structural investigations were performed by way of
a JEOL JEM 2010 transmission electron microscope.

General Procedure for the Addition of Nitroalkane to Aldehydes
Catalyzed by Free Ligands in the Homogeneous Phase
The chiral
ligand (0.10 mmol) and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (0.10
mmol, 20 mg) were dissolved in 3 mL of 2-PrOH or Et2O and
stirred for 20 min. Nitroalkane (10 mmol, 0.53 mL of nitromethane
or 0.71 mL of nitroethane) was added, and the mixture was stirred
for 20 min. The aldehyde (1 mmol) was added, and the reaction was
stirred at room temperature for 72 h. The solvent was evaporated in
vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in diethyl ether and filtered
through a 1:1 silica/Celite pad with ether. The solvent was evaporated
in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography
(Hex/EtOAc, 80:20).

General Procedure for the Addition of Nitroalkane to Aldehydes
Catalyzed by Functionalized Nanoparticles
Cu(OAc)2·H2O (0.025 mmol, 5 mg) was added to a dispersion
of the functionalized nanoparticles (10 mol %) in 3 mL of 2-PrOH,
and the mixture was mechanically agitated for 20 min. Nitromethane
(2.5 mmol, 0.132 mL) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 20
min. The aldehyde (0.25 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred
at room temperature for 72 h. The reaction vessel was placed over
an external magnet until the reaction mixture became transparent,
and the solution was separated from the nanoparticles. The mixture
was filtered through a 1:1 silica/Celite pad with diethyl ether. The
solvent was evaporated in vacuo, and the crude product was purified
by flash chromatography (Hex/EtOAc, 80:20). The recovered nanoparticles
were repeatedly washed with diethyl ether and 2-PrOH and then stored
in 3 mL of 2-PrOH.

Detailed descriptions of homogeneous phase nitromethane addition

Synthesis of Magnetite–Silica Core–Shell Nanoparticles
Mohr salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O) (3.82 mmol, 1.5 g), Fe2(SO4)3 (3.82 mmol, 1.5 g), and polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) (19 mmol, 2.12 g) were dissolved in 200 mL of distilled water.
The Fe2+/Fe3+ solution thus prepared was filtered
and added into a filtered solution of 19 mmol (2.12 g) of PVP and
150 mL of NH3 (33 wt % aqueous solution) in 500 mL of water
under mechanical stirring and continuously flowing argon gas. The
solution was reacted for 30 min at room temperature, and then it was
heated to 80 °C for 30 min. After cooling down the reaction mixture,
the product was separated by magnetic decantation and dialyzed overnight.
The magnetite nanoparticles were dispersed in 30 mL of water by sonication,
and a solution of 0.4 mL of tetraethylortosilicate (TEOS) and 3.25
mL of in NH3 (33 wt % aqueous solution) in 150 mL of 2-PrOH
was added dropwise under vigorous mechanical stirring. The reaction
was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, and the product was separated
by magnetic decantation and repeatedly washed with 2-PrOH and water.
The as-synthesized silica-coated magnetite nanoparticles were stored

Immobilization via Click Reaction
The azido-functionalized
silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles 9a or 9b (150 mg) were dispersed in 10 mL of THF. The terminal alkyne 8 (0.3 mmol, 140 mg) and CuI (0.09 mmol, 19 mg) were added
under mechanical stirring. A 0.4 mL solution of DIPEA was injected
dropwise into the mixture, and the reaction was mechanically stirred
for 48 h at room temperature. The product was separated by magnetic
decantation and repeatedly washed with THF and then with NH4Cl s.s., water, acetone, and toluene. The functionalized silica-coated
magnetite nanoparticles were stored in 20 mL of toluene. 7a, obtained: 200 mg. Loading: 0.28 mmol/g calculated by elemental
analysis: N, 1.95%; C, 8.69%. FTIR (neat/ν cm–1): 3421, 2934, 2849, 1510, 1056, 551. 7b, obtained:
280 mg. Loading: 0.41 mmol/g calculated by elemental analysis: N,
2.89%; C, 13.94%. FTIR (neat/ν cm–1): 3315,
