This work investigates
the photovoltaic properties of polymers
that include different carbazole blocks as electron donors (D) but
the same benzothiadiazole derivative as the electron acceptor (A).
Five D–A copolymers are studied with ultrafast intramolecular
exciton splitting and recombination dynamics to acquire the single-molecule
structure and their photovoltaic performance relationship. The photovoltaic
parameters such as energy level, optical band gap, and light-harvesting
ability are highly dependent on the molecular structure of the donor
monomer (including their appended flexible alkyl chain). Branched
or linear alkyl groups on the same D block obviously vary the polymer
steady-state absorption spectra and film morphology. For organic solar
cells, this work allows tuning and control of the ultrafast dynamics,
implying photovoltaic material design in the future.

Introduction
World clean energy
imperious demands inevitably trigger the rapid
development of renewable energy technology.1 Among these, solar power is the most abundant clean energy.2,3 One of the direct applications of solar power is organic solar cells
(OSCs).4 Basically, OSCs’ active
layer was constructed by two types of organic semiconductors. One
is a p-type electron donor, and the other is an n-type electron acceptor.
The electronic nature of these different types of materials plenarily
decides the device power conversion efficiency and application life
span.5 Hitherto, new materials and device
engineering have pushed this technology to a great level which
is already near the commercial application threshold.6−8 All kinds of π-conjugated n- or p-type polymers because of
their unique optoelectronic properties were laboriously synthesized
and investigated for potential applications in OSCs,9,10 organic transistors (OTFTs),11 and organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).12,13 Most semiconductor
polymers were constructed using aromatic heterocyclic monomers for
their special electronic properties.14,15 Among the
various aromatic heteroring polymers, in general, an electron-rich
aromatic monomer, or a polycyclic aromatic unit, is employed as the
electron donating ingredient and an electron-deficient aromatic monomer
functionalized with electron-withdrawing groups is used as the electron-accepting
unit to prepare the so-called D–A (or push–pull) copolymers.16 For electron-rich building blocks in the polymer
field, carbazole (CBZ),17,18 5,11-dihydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (DCBZ),19 and phenanthrocarbazole
(PCBZ)20−22 have been demonstrated to be the most versatile and
effective building blocks for organic photoelectric materials.
However, these three electron-rich donor blocks bind the same electron-lacking
unit to construct a series of alternating copolymers, and their optoelectronic
characteristics are still unknown. Especially, these donor blocks
can greatly tune the energy level, the electron excitation and relaxation
path, and the molecular packing behaviors. For bulk heterojunction
solar cells, first, p-type and n-type materials strongly absorb light.
The local dipole electron density is excited and redistributed to form a
charge-separated (CS) state along the molecule.23 Second, at the p–n domain interface, the CS state
excitons overcome the Coulomb binding energy barrier and split
to free charge.24 The separation and recombination
processes of electron–hole pair are very important for OSCs.25,26 However, of particular importance is the single-molecule structure
first excited by photons.27,28 The molecular structure
decides the electron excitation and separation pathway and efficiency.29,30 Good understanding of this plays a crucial role in improving the
efficiency of solar cells.31−33 Here, the OSC performances of
five polymers correlated to the ultrafast intramolecular charge splitting
dynamics—namely, HXS-1 with CBZ polymerized at the 2 and 7
positions and 5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole (BOBT) at the
4 and 7 positions; HXS-2 and HXS-3 that contain PCBZ and BOBT, respectively;
and HXS-4 and HXS-5 that coupled DCBZ with BOBT—were investigated.

Results
and Discussion
Structural and Optical Properties
The molecular structures
of the five studied polymers are shown in Scheme 1 in the Experimental Section. The absorption spectra of polymers HXS-1 to HXS-5 in chloroform
solution and films are shown in Figure 1a,b. The key optical parameters and electrochemical
results are summarized in Table 1. All polymers show two broad absorption bands in the
range of 300–420 nm and 430–750 nm. Compared with HXS-1,
the absorption peaks of HXS-2 and HXS-3) are broadened and blue-shifted
both in solution and films. HXS-2 and HXS-3 show similar absorption
spectra, which indicates that the alkyl substituents on the PCBZ unit
have a weak influence on the conjugation of the polymer main chain.
However, the larger aromatic PCBZ in contrast to CBZ broadened the
absorption range of the long-wavelength peak band by ∼20 nm.
Carefully checking the spectra, HXS-2 bearing a branched alkyl on
PCBZ exhibited a wider absorption band than HXS-3 bearing a linear
alkyl. It was concluded that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
effect was disturbed by the flexible alkyl chain as a branch alkyl
group facilitates electron conjugation along the aromatic main chain
more effectively. This point was clearly supported by similar examples
of HXS-4 and HXS-5. HXS-4 shows a strong and broadened absorption
peak band between 400 and 750 nm. Compared with HXS-1 again, the absorption
peak of HXS-4 in chloroform solution is markedly red-shifted due to
the more electron-rich property of the DCBZ unit. By means of computational
simulation, the torsion angles between carbazole architecture blocks
and the acceptor are as follows: HXS-1 = 27.5°, HXS-2 = 64.5°,
HXS-3 = 63.7°, HXS-4 = 1.6°, and HXS-5 = 1.3° (Figure S1). The calculation result is reasonable
such that lower band gap polymers have smaller torsion angles. However,
between the branched and linear alkyl group on the same donor blocks,
the branched alkyl group facilitates electron delocalization along
the conjugated backbone. Obviously, for HXS-4 and HXS-5, the
experimental spectra data are mildly contradictory to the calculated
torsion angles. This can be explained by the fact that the calculation
did not consider the solvent effect but only the molecular configuration.
Optical band gaps of HXS-1 to HXS-3 are almost at the same level (Table 1). Table 1 summarizes the optical properties
and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level. For the five
polymers, HXS-4 gave the narrowest band gap of 1.65 eV (Figure S2).

Morphology
The active layer morphology greatly influences
device performance.34−38 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to probe the polymer aggregation
effect, as shown in Figure S3, for HXS-1,
HXS-4, and HXS-5, it was clearly revealed that the polymers formed
some degree of crystallinity and the π–π distance
between the main chains is 0.39 nm for HXS-1, 0.40 nm for HXS-4, and
0.41 nm for HXS-5. A closer distance between polymer main chains,
which are separated by the alkyl side chains are 1.07 nm for HXS-4
and 0.94 nm for HXS-5, compared with 1.7 nm of HXS-1. For the polymer
with the bulky unit PCBZ, the crystallinity was destroyed and only
a faint crystal trace can be perceived between 2θ = 30–50°.
We surmised that this was caused by the large torsion angle, and the
faint XRD signal comes from the large plane segment diffraction on
the polymer main chain. Therefore, it can be concluded that polymers
HXS-2 and HXS-3 are almost totally amorphous. The AFM and TEM images
shown in Figure S4 provide direct evidence
of the molecular chain interactions found in the polymers. HXS-1 obtained
ideal phase separation with PC71BM. The root mean square
(RMS) value is 5.22 nm. For HXS-2, HXS-3, and HXS-4, these reference
values are 1.23, 1.57, and 1.01 nm, respectively. For HXS-5, a big
cluster was formed, and the RMS is 9.03 nm. The bottom TEM images
(Figure S4) also disclosed this character.
This in connection with the XRD analysis gave us some clues that bulky
donor units and the affiliated alkyl side chain greatly changed the
polymer aggregation ability and the consequent active layer morphology.
Branched swallow-tail like alkyl (e.g. HXS-2 and HXS-4) facilitated
a minor scale phase separation. The linear alky chains on HXS-3 and
HXS-5 have the opposite effect such as a narrow absorption band and
huge domain size. The weight-average molecular weights of these polymers
are 51.4, 43.29, 46.62, 5.74, and 3.31 kg/mol for HXS-1 to HXS-5,
respectively, and their corresponding polydispersity indices (PDIs)
are 3.1, 1.93, 1.74, 1.52, and 1.21. Apart from HXS-1 obtaining a
high molecular weight but wide PDI, the other polymers with a bulky
donor unit had low molecular weights but narrow PDI. It revealed that
the molecular weights heavily depend on the donor block’s solubility
in the reaction mixture.

Device Performance
OSCs devices
were fabricated to
explore the photovoltaic performance of different polymers. Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic
parameters. The current density–voltage (J–V) plots and the external quantum efficiency
(EQE) curves with the optimal photovoltaic performance under illumination
of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm–2) are shown in Figure 2. The device based on polymer
HXS-1 has the best device data. Amorphous HXS-2 and HXS-3 provided
poor fill factors for the reason of unideal phase separation. Moreover,
the transient absorption (TA) spectra provide some strong evidence,
which will be discussed later.

Figure S5 reveals that the exciton dissociation
possibilities Pdiss were 59.89 and 60.47%
for HXS-2 and HXS-3, respectively, consequently leading to worse performances;
meanwhile, this parameter is 72.5% for HXS-1. Benefiting from the
broadened absorption band, HXS-4 showed a large short-circuit current
density (Jsc) and a high PCE of 2.3% compared
to HXS-5. The device Pdiss of HXS-4 is
68.97%, which is also higher than the 57.3% of HXS-5. The EQE in Figure 2b also demonstrated
this.

Ultrafast Spectra
TA spectra and dynamics after excitation
with 450 nm pump light are shown in Figure 3. The TA spectra curves are broad across
the 850–1400 nm region. For HXS-1, kinetic traces taken in
the 897 nm region greatly decay within 0–2000 ps and do not
show any change in spectral structure except intensity (inset in Figure 3a). The most striking
absorption peak around 897 nm soon after excitation appeared and was
assigned to the charge separate (CS) state. This assignment is because
this signal located in the polymer cation steady-state absorption
is featured in a spectrum band range that was obtained after adding
an oxidant FeCl3 into the solution (Figures S6 and S7). The high population of CS states and long
life time cation decay characteristic (τ1 = 2.62
ns) make it more easy to understand the high PCE result for HXS-1
(Figure 3b). The TA
spectra and dynamics features for HXS-2 and HXS-3 reveal that a mixed
absorption band including a small ratio of CS state population (830–1000
nm) (τ1) and an intramolecular charge semi-separated
(ICSS) state, which occupied a large ratio (1100–1400 nm) (τ2) appeared soon after excitation (Figure 3c,d). The ICSS state is tentatively because
the exciton had half-split into a hole–electron pair and is
still close enough to undergo Coulombic attraction.39 The short life time ICSS state decayed fast, which certainly
does not produce any increase in the value of Jsc (Table S1). After approximately
4 ns, the long-lived CS state upthrust from the blend peak. Considering
the molecular structure, it was unveiled that, to some extent, it
is difficult to break the electron density symmetry in the excited
state for large electron-donor-unit polymers (HXS-2 to HXS-5) to
form CS state species. Consequently small proportions of the CS state
for HXS-2 and HXS-3 are bound to a poor photovoltaic effect because
only CS state carriers lastly become free charge.40 HXS-4 and HXS-5 have similar features (Figure 3e,f) although HXS-2 and HXS-3
show longer CS state life times but a small population. However, carefully
discerning Figure 3e,f, HXS-4 incipient excitation exhibited a narrow peak band (1100–1400
nm) compared to HXS-5, and this again supported the idea that branched
alkyl groups facilitate electron delocalization along the conjugated
backbone.

indicated.

Conclusions
In
summary, the photovoltaic efficiencies of five polymers furnished
with different carbazole electron donor units were investigated. Apart
from the universal facts relative to photovoltaic performance:
materials light absorption spectra meet solar radiation and high absorption
coefficient, energy level match, morphology ordering, charge mobility
high and balance, we especially studied the singular molecular excitation,
separation pathway, and efficiency that are the decisive factors of
PCE. Large aromatic blocks have a broad electron delocalization domain;
thus, it is difficult to break the excited state electron density
symmetry to form large populations of CS-state species. This key fact
greatly deteriorates the device photovoltaic performance.
