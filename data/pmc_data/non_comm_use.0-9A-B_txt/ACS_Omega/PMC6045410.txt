A synthetic
molecule S006-830, belonging to the class of thiophene-containing
trisubstituted methanes, had shown good in vitro and in vivo bactericidal
activity against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The molecule had
also shown good druglike pharmacokinetic properties. However, S006-830
is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, one of which could possess
a better pharmacological profile than the other. We purified both
the enantiomers on a chiral column and observed that S-enantiomer
has a significantly higher inhibitory and cidal activity against Mtb
than the R-enantiomer. Action of S-S006-830 was “synergistic”
for rifampicin and “additive” for isoniazid and ethambutol.
The combination of S-S006-830 and rifampicin produced
100% kill of Mtb within 8 days. In a chemical proteomics approach
using matrix-bound compound to pull down its target protein(s) from
Mtb membrane, FabG4 (β-ketoacyl CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.100)
emerged as the most likely target for S-S006-830.
In target validation assays, the compound exhibited 2-fold higher
inhibitory concentration for an Mtb construct overexpressing FabG4.
In addition, it inhibited mycolic acid biosynthesis and formation
of biofilms by Mtb. Molecular docking of S-S006-830
with FabG4 was consistent with the experimental data. These results
support the development of S-S006-830 as a novel
lead against tuberculosis.

==== Body
Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is
a leading cause of death from infectious disease.
In 2015, there were over 10 million new patients and nearly 2 million
deaths due to TB.1 More alarmingly, there
were over half a million new cases of multidrug-/rifampicin-resistant
(MDR/RR) TB. The treatment outcome data, on the other hand, show dismal
success rates (83% for TB, 52% for MDR/RR TB, and 28% for XDR [extensively
drug-resistant] TB). These figures reemphasize the need for new and
potent anti-TB drugs. Several candidate drugs, including six “new
chemical entities” are currently under clinical trials.1 Nonetheless, the process of developing a new
drug is fraught with frequent setbacks. For instance, development
of AZD5847 was terminated due to lack of anti-TB activity and that
of TBA-354 had to be discontinued due to toxicity.1 Besides, the life of a successful antibiotic is cut short
by the emergence of drug-resistant microbes. It is therefore considered
prudent to keep the drug pipeline awash with newer molecules.

In our ongoing campaign against TB, we have previously reported
on the synthesis and evaluation of novel thiophene-containing trisubstituted
methanes with antimycobacterial properties.2−5 The identified lead S006-830 [diisopropyl-(2-{4-[(R,S)-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-thiophen-2-yl-methyl]-phenoxy}-ethyl)-amine]
showed an ex vivo efficacy comparable with isoniazid (INH), rifampicin
(RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA) and in vivo efficacy comparable with
ethambutol (EMB) and PZA, with over 10-fold reduction in viable bacilli
in the lungs of mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In addition, the compound also showed bactericidal activity
against MDR, RR, and INHR (INH-resistant) clinical isolates of Mtb.4 In preclinical evaluations, the compound demonstrated
good pharmacokinetic (PK) properties with rapid intestinal absorption.6,7 Peak plasma concentration was achieved at <1 h post oral dose,
the elimination half-life was ∼9 h, the mean residence time
was ∼11 h, plasma protein binding was ∼60%, and bioavailability
was in the range of 45–50%. Cotreatment with S006-830 and verapamil
(a P-gp inhibitor) in intestinal perfusion assay indicated that P-gp
may not be involved in the absorption of S006-830 and the compound
may primarily be absorbed by paracellular transport.8 The compound was stable under various operating conditions.
These PK parameters indicated rapid oral absorption, good tissue redistribution,
and fast clearance of S006-830, which are the characteristics of a
druglike molecule.

S006-830 has a chiral center (Supporting
Information, Figure S1) and hence can exist
in two enantiomeric
forms: R and S. Enantiomers of a chiral drug are known to differ significantly
in their pharmacological and/or PK properties.9 The significance of stereochemistry for drug activity has been studied
in detail in the case of quinolones. Antibacterial activity of their
S-enantiomers is considerably higher than that of the R-enantiomers
or racemate, with 4- to 250-fold difference in the in vitro activity
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.10 Among the new antitubercular drugs, S-enantiomer of PA-824 is nearly 100-fold more active than
the R-enantiomer.11 In
contrast, its R-enantiomer was more potent against Leishmania donovani. Bedaquiline has two chiral centers
with four possible enantiomers, one of which (R,S) is more active
than the rest.12 Benzothiazinone also has
a chiral center, though both enantiomers are equipotent in vitro.13 Thus, an enantiopure drug may possess better
pharmacologic and therapeutic profiles, along with simpler PK, than
the racemate. Nonetheless, there are also instances where both enantiomers
of a chiral drug contribute to its therapeutic effects and use of
a single enantiomer may be less effective or even less safe.9

In this study, we have purified both the
enantiomers of S006-830
and compared their antitubercular activity vis-à-vis the racemate.
Absolute configuration of the enantiomer showing higher activity was
determined with the help of X-ray crystallography. The more active
enantiomer was subjected to further evaluations aimed at unveiling
its interactions with the first-line TB drugs, kill kinetics, and
mechanism of action. To get an insight into the mechanism of action,
we employed a chemical proteomics-based approach,14 which was complemented with the phenotypic approaches based
on biosynthesis of cell wall mycolic acids15 and biofilm-forming property16 of Mtb.
Finally, molecular modeling was employed to decipher the interactions
between the compound and its putative target protein.

Results
Isolation of
S006-830 Enantiomers
Several recipes were
tried to select the solvent system, which could provide best separation
of both the enantiomers of S006-830 on a chiral column. Final separation
was achieved with a mobile phase comprising 0.5% isopropanol in methanol.
Retention times of the enantiomers were ∼13.22 and ∼14.88
min, and their optical purities were 99.2951 and 99.0467%, respectively
(Figure 1). The ratio
of the enantiomers in S006-830 racemate was determined as 50.06:49.96.

Figure 1 Racemate
(A) and enantiomer (B, C) chromatograms of S006-830 using
supercritical fluid chromatography on OJ-H column. The optimized isocratic
conditions were methanol containing 0.5% isopropanol and flow rate
of 2.5 mL/min. The outlet pressure was set to 120 bar and temperature
was 35 °C. Detection wavelength was 233 nm.

Antitubercular Activity of the Enantiomers
Antitubercular
activity of the S006-830 racemate has previously been reported by
us.4 Therefore, we presently explored whether
there was a difference in the potencies of its enantiomers. In drug-free
cultures, the Mtb inoculums (∼106 colony-forming
units, cfu) multiplied nearly 2.5 logs (∼5 × 108 cfu) over a period of 7 days (Figure 2). The S-enantiomer showed a minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) of 3.12 μg/mL, which was over 2-fold lower than the MIC
of R-enantiomer (12.5 μg/mL) or the racemate (≥6.25 μg/mL).
More importantly, only S-enantiomer showed a bactericidal activity
(i.e., killing of the bacilli in inoculums) with a minimum bactericidal
concentration (MBC) of 6.25 μg/mL. The activity of the R-enantiomer
as well as racemate appeared to be bacteriostatic (i.e., inhibiting
the multiplication of the bacilli in inoculums) within the used concentration
range. These results demonstrated that S-S006-830
had a significantly higher antitubercular potency, in quantitative
as well as qualitative terms, than R-S006-830 or
the racemate (RS-S006-830).

Figure 2 In vitro activity of
S006-830 racemate (RS-S006-830)
and its enantiomers against M. tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb). Bacterial suspensions (inoculums) were exposed to the
vehicle (untreated) or compounds (3.125 and 6.25 μg/mL) for
7 days. The number of viable bacteria (cfu) was determined on days
0 (for bacterial counts in the inoculums) and 7 (for multiplication
of bacilli in the inoculums in the presence of vehicle or compounds).
Cutoff values for MIC (dotted line) and MBC (solid line) are shown.
The S-enantiomer (S-S006-830) showed the highest
antitubercular activity in terms of MIC as well as MBC. The corresponding P values are shown (ns = not significant).

We next compared the potencies of S- and R-enantiomers
for killing
of intracellular Mtb in the mouse macrophage model of infection. The
infected macrophages were exposed to 2× MICs of the test compounds
or standard drug isoniazid (INH). After 5 days of exposure, the S-enantiomer was able to kill 91% of the bacilli in inoculums
(i.e., 0 day cfu) (Figure 3). This activity was significantly higher than the corresponding
values for R-enantiomer (62% kill) or INH (80% kill). None of the
compounds were toxic for uninfected macrophages (data not shown).

Figure 3 Ex vivo
activities of the S006-830 and its enantiomers against
Mtb within mouse macrophages. Macrophages were infected for 3 h and
then exposed for 5 days to the standard drug (INH) or test compounds
(RS-S006-830, R-S006-830, and S-S006-830) at their 2× MICs. The number of viable
bacteria (cfu) was determined on days 0 and 5. Although all compounds
and INH showed a bactericidal activity (i.e., reduction in day 0 counts),
the activity of S-S006-830 was significantly higher
than the R-enantiomer and INH. The corresponding P values are shown (ns = not significant).

The results of the in vitro and ex vivo antitubercular activities
led us to select S-S006-830 as the lead compound
for further investigations.

Interaction of S-S006-830
with Frontline TB
Drugs
We determined the drug–drug interactions between S-S006-830 and three frontline TB drugs in view of the fact
that any new drug has to be a part of the combination therapy (so
as to minimize the emergence of drug resistance).1 Interaction profiles of S-S006-830 with
TB drugs are depicted in Table 1. The combination of S-S006-830 with rifampicin
(RIF) was found to be “synergistic” (fractional inhibitory
concentration index or FICI = 0.5), whereas the combinations with
INH (FICI = 0.75) and ethambutol (EMB; FICI = 0.5625) were “additive”
in nature. These results suggest that a combination of S-S006-830 with any of the three anti-TB drugs (particularly RIF)
is likely to show higher efficacies at lower individual dosages.

and Frontline TB Drugs Rifampicin, Isoniazid,
and Ethambutol in Two-Drug Combination Checkerboard Assays

a FICI value ≤0.5 indicates
synergistic activity, FICI of ≥4.0 indicates antagonistic activity,
and values in between ≤4.0 and ≥0.5 indicate an additive
interaction.

The fact that
observed “MIC” of S-S006-830 in this
assay was higher than that determined by the MIC
assay (above) needs to be considered. The checkerboard method is based
on “no visible growth” of bacilli in inoculums over
a period of 3 weeks. In that sense, MIC is in fact a measure of MBC.
Further, the bacilli were cultured for extra 2 weeks (compared to
just 1 week for MIC/MBC assays), which would give the residual viable
bacilli a chance to grow, resulting in enhanced MIC/MBC.

To
validate the synergistic or additive effects of S-S006-830 on frontline TB drugs, time-kill kinetics studies were
performed. Time-kill kinetics of S-S006-830 alone
or in combination with RIF, INH, or EMB is depicted in Figure 4. In drug-free cultures, Mtb
in the inoculums (5 × 105 cfu) multiplied 4 logs (to
approximately 5 × 109 cfu) in a span of 8 days. Within
the same time frame, the combination (2× MIC each) of S-S006-830 and RIF produced 100% kill of the bacilli in
inoculums. Importantly, neither drug alone could achieve this level
of efficacy. However, the combination of S-S006-830
with INH showed only a marginal improvement and that with EMB showed
no improvement over the kill achieved by each drug individually. These
results suggest that the combination of S-S006-830
with RIF was most efficacious, followed by the combinations with INH
and EMB.

rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Mtb inoculums were exposed
to 2× MICs of RIF (A), INH (B), or EMB (C), either alone or in
combination with S-S006-830. After 2, 4, 6, and 8
days of exposure, serial 10-fold dilutions of Mtb suspension from
each set of experiment were plated on MB agar for cfu determinations.

Identification of the Target(s)
of S-S006-830
By Chemical Proteomics
Chemical proteomics is the method
of choice for the identification of the putative target(s) of a drug
in an unbiased manner.14 The method combines
drug-affinity chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry
for the identification of proteins. To pursue this approach, S-S006-830 was coupled with DADPA-activated agarose beads
(Supporting Information, Figure S2) and
the membrane proteins of Mtb, solubilized with a nonionic detergent
(CHAPS), were incubated with bead-bound S-S006-830.
The beads were washed extensively to remove all loosely or nonspecifically
bound proteins. To ensure this, each wash was monitored by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Supporting
Information, Figure S3).

Two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis (2-DE) of the affinity matrix-bound proteins revealed
four spots (Figure 5). Peptide-mass fingerprinting of these spots led to the identification
of corresponding proteins as FabG4 (sequence coverage, 61%), RplJ
(sequence coverage, 61%), and BfrB (in two spots with sequence coverage
of 26 and 54%). The sequences covered
by the tryptic peptides in each case are depicted in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Identification of Mtb
proteins targeted by S-S006-830.
The membrane proteins of Mtb (solubilized by CHAPS) were incubated
overnight with S-S006-830 linked to a matrix (agarose
beads). Affinity matrix-bound proteins were resolved by 2-DE, digested
with trypsin, and identified by LC-MS-MS. The identified proteins
were FabG4, RplJ, and BfrB (appearing in two spots). Complete as well
as covered (in red) sequences of these proteins are also shown.

In addition to the membrane, we
also incubated cytosolic proteins
of Mtb with bead-linked S-S006-830. However, 2-DE
analysis of the washed beads in this case did not show any protein
spot, suggesting that the putative target(s) were enriched in the
Mtb membrane. This observation is consistent with the reported membrane
association of the targets of most antitubercular compounds.1

By Comparing Membrane Proteome of the Wild-Type
and S-S006-830-Resistant Mtb
This approach
was pursued
as a supplement to chemical proteomics. It is based on the premise
that the target protein(s) might get overexpressed by the bacilli
which are grown under drug pressure.17 Drug
sensitivity profiles of the wild-type Mtb and Mtb made resistant to S-S006-830 by culturing under drug pressure are shown in
the Supporting Information, Table S3. The
resistant bacilli showed compound-specific resistance while remaining
sensitive to RIF, INH, and EMB.

Comparison of the 2-DE patterns
of membrane proteins of the wild-type and S-S006-830-resistant
Mtb (Supporting Information, Figure S4)
revealed the proteins that were overexpressed by the resistant bacilli.
Consistent with the results of chemical proteomics, FabG4 was identified
as one of the three overexpressed proteins (Supporting Information, Table S4). The other two proteins were considered
as inconsequential because they did not figure among the proteins
pulled down by drug-affinity matrix.

The pull-down of FabG4
by drug-affinity beads along with its overexpression
by S-S006-830-resistant Mtb suggested that FabG4
was the most likely target for the compound. We therefore went on
to validate this probability.

Validation of FabG4 as
the Target for S-S006-830
Effect of fabG4 Overexpression
on the Sensitivity of Mtb for
the Compound
Overexpression of the target in a drug-sensitive
microbe is expected to push upward the MIC of a drug.17 We prepared a construct of Mtb overexpressing FabG4 (Supporting
Information, Figure S5) and used it in
the MIC assays. The results (Supporting Information, Table S5) show over 2-fold increase in the MIC of S-S006-830 (=6.25 μg/mL) against the construct, compared
with its MIC against the vector control or parental Mtb strain (=3.125
μg/mL). On the other hand, the susceptibility of the construct
for RIF, INH, and EMB remained unchanged. These results supported
the probability of FabG4 being the target of S-S006-830.

Effect on the Synthesis of Mycolic Acids
FabG4 belongs
to the family of β ketoacyl reductases and utilizes NADH to
reduce 3-ketoacetyl CoA to 3-hydroxyacetyl CoA, which is involved
in the type-II fatty acid synthase (FAS-II) pathway.18 FAS-II in Mtb generates mycolic acids, which are vital
components of the cell envelope.15 We therefore
decided to determine the effect of S-S006-830 on
the synthesis of mycolic acids. Mtb cultures were treated with S-S006-830 or INH prior to metabolic labeling of the bacilli
with [14C]acetate. Radiolabeled lipids, extracted from
bacterial cells, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).
As shown in Figure 6, treatment with S-S006-830 suppressed the synthesis
of all mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) in a dose-dependent manner.
However, the inhibition was not as steep as that caused by INH, which
is a highly potent inhibitor of the mycolic acid biosynthesis. As
per applied protocol, only a short exposure (15 h) of 1–2 MICs
of the drug/compound was given to high inoculums (∼1010 cfu) of Mtb, which did not affect the bacterial cell viability significantly
(data not shown).

Figure 6 Reduction in the synthesis of mycolic acids by S-S006-830. Top panel shows TLC of [14C]-labeled
mycolic
acid methyl esters (MAMEs) of Mtb treated with 1× and 2×
MICs of S-S006-830 or INH. Equal counts were loaded
and chromatogram was developed with hexane/ethyl acetate (19:1, v/v,
two runs) as solvent system. The amount of radioactivity incorporated
in the products of interest was semiquantified using a phosphorimager,
and the results (expressed as a percentage of the value measured in
the untreated control, 0× MICs) are presented as histograms (bottom
panels).

Inhibition of Biofilm Formation
In its growth medium,
Mtb typically forms biofilms at the liquid–air interface. Bacteria
within the biofilm stay embedded in a complex extracellular matrix
(ECM). In case of Mtb, mycolic acids and some polyketide synthase1
(PKS-1)-generated unknown lipids have been described as the components
of ECM.16 FabG4 is overexpressed by the
Mtb in biofilms19 and hence could be involved
in the biosynthesis of ECM lipids. We therefore determined the effect
of S-S006-830 on the formation of biofilm by Mtb.
As shown in Supporting Information, Figure S6, the compound inhibited biofilm formation by the wild-type bacilli
in a dose-dependent manner. There was a marked inhibition at 1×
and complete inhibition at 2× MIC. On the other hand, the compound
did not inhibit biofilm formation by the S-S006-830-resistant
Mtb. These results indicated once again that S-S006-830
could be acting through inhibition of the cell wall lipids, including
mycolic acids.

Crystal Structure of S-S006-830
and Computational
Studies
The binding of a drug to its target protein involves
interactions between hydrogen bonding functionalities of the drug
and their complementary sites on the target. Such interactions may
have considerable steric constraints, for example, in terms of interatomic
distance and steric bulk.

Crystal Structure
The stereochemistry
of the lead enantiomer
was assigned to as S-S006-830 with the help of X-ray
crystallography. Absolute structure in this case was determined using
2121 Friedel pairs (Bijvoet pairs coverage, ∼96%) with a Flack
parameter20 value of 0.07(3). Crystal structure
showed disorder in the thiophene ring of the molecule and was refined
further with sulfur atom disordered over two positions with a 0.86:0.14
occupancy ratio. Final refinements were performed using TWIN/BASF
instructions to account for a possible inversion twin. ORTEP showing
the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of S-S006-830 is depicted in Figure 7a. The pendant thiophene ring and N,N-diethylamino group from either side of the chains
form interlocked zipper-type motif in the crystal, stabilized by weak
C–H···π interactions (Figure 7b). The compound contains two
alkoxy O-atoms, one amino N-atom, and heterocyclic S-atom that can
serve as potential hydrogen bond acceptors. Besides this, thiophene
and phenyl rings can act as π acceptors. Local maxima and minima
on the molecular electrostatic potential surface were used for the
identification of potential interaction sites present on S-S006-830 that may be involved in the interaction with the target
protein. The computed values for hydrogen bond interaction parameters
(α, β) show highest values for the β-parameter on
the two alkoxy O-atoms indicative of a preferential hydrogen bond
acceptor site. The thiophene and phenyl C–H groups possess
the most electrophilic sites that can provide weak C–H···O/C–H···π-type
interactions (Figure 7c). Involvement of these interactions was also seen in the crystal.
The S-S006-830 molecules arranged in a zigzag chain
were held by weak C–H···O interactions formed
between the two alkoxy groups in the crystal (Supporting Information, Table S6).

site overlay of NAD+ and S-S006-830 bound

Molecular Docking
Active site analysis resulted in
the identification of two plausible ligand-binding pockets on FabG4
protein (Supporting Information, Figure S7). The top-scored site-1 is the larger pocket that spans the NAD+ and hexanoyl-CoA binding region of the C-terminal domain
of FabG4 complex. Site-2, on the other hand, corresponds to a smaller
pocket located in the N-terminal domain (Supporting Information, Table S7). Molecular docking studies were performed
on both of the pockets to ascertain the most probable binding region
for S-S006-830. Due to the large pocket size of site-1,
the docking of S006-830 was performed by considering the NAD+ and hexanoyl-CoA binding regions separately in two sets for an efficient
sampling. Additionally, a comparative docking with R-S006-830 onto these pockets was performed to assess the binding
preference of the two enantiomers for FabG4. Both enantiomers showed
a preference for site-1 to site-2 (Supporting Information, Figures S8 and S9) as reflected by higher dock
scores (Supporting Information, Tables S8 and S9). Among the two, the S-enantiomer showed a slightly higher
binding free-energy score (−8.09) than R-enantiomer (−7.99).
Docking shows a preferential binding of S-S006-830
near the NAD+ binding region (Figure 7d). Top-scored docking pose shows a weak
C–H···π interaction with VAL245 (Supporting
Information, Table S8).

Discussion
In our earlier studies, the S006-830 racemate had shown an impressive
bactericidal activity against drug-sensitive as well as drug-resistant
Mtb.4 It had produced over 10-fold reduction
in viable bacterial counts in the lungs of mice infected with Mtb,
an activity comparable with some of the candidate antitubercular drugs
currently under trial.1 This in vivo activity
was attained despite relatively high (compared with other drug candidates)
MIC and MBC of the compound, owing perhaps to its good oral bioavailability.7,8 As the pharmacokinetic profiles of enantiomers of a drug may differ
markedly from the racemate,9 evaluation
of the enantiomers of S006-830 presented a possibility for reduction
in its effective dose, which could lead to improvement in its efficacy
and safety profiles.

Both the enantiomers (R-S006-830 and S-S006-830) could be isolated, each
with over 99% purity, from the
racemate (RS-S006-830) by supercritical fluid chromatography.
MIC of S-S006-830 for Mtb was <50% of the MICs
of R-S006-830 or RS-S006-830. More
importantly, at lower concentrations, the action of the S-enantiomer
was bactericidal, whereas it was bacteriostatic in cases of R-enantiomer
or the racemate. Against intracellular Mtb also, the bactericidal
activity of S-enantiomer was significantly higher. These observations
formed the basis for choosing S-enantiomer as the lead compound, and
its absolute configuration could be assigned with the help of X-ray
crystallography. In drug–drug interaction studies, the most
noteworthy observation was the synergy between S-S006-830
and rifampicin. Although neither could kill 100% of the bacilli on
their own, their combination could do so. Remarkably, the effective
dose of S-S006-830 in this combination was approximately
1/4 of the dose if used alone. Therefore, as a component of “combination
therapy”, S-S006-830 is likely to show better
efficacy as well as safety profiles.

In the chemical proteomics-based
approach for target identification,14 three
membrane-associated proteins of Mtb, BfrB,
RplJ, and FabG4, were pulled down by S-S006-830.
The used protocol for linking the compound to affinity matrix was
such that its putative pharmacophore4,5 remained free
to interact with target protein(s). Membrane association of all three
proteins has previously been demonstrated by us21 and others.22 BfrB is a ferritin-like
protein and exists as an assembly of 24 monomers with a central cavity
to store ferric iron, which is transported into the cytoplasm of Mtb
by the cell-envelope-associated siderophore mycobactins.23 The 50 S ribosomal protein RplJ (L10) is involved
in translation mechanisms and remains complexed with other ribosomal
proteins on the inner surface of Mtb cell membrane.21,24 The third pulled-down protein FabG4 belongs to the family of FabGs
(β-ketoacyl CoA reductases), which catalyze the second step
of FAS-II pathway, where NAD(P)H is utilized to reduce β-oxoacyl-ACP
to β-hydroxyacyl-ACP.18 In Mtb, FAS-II
produces mycolic acids, which are vital components of the cell envelope.15

A possible limitation of chemical proteomics
is that pull-down
of a protein depends on its affinity as well as abundance, due to
which some high-abundance proteins with low affinity (for the compound)
may also get pulled down. Due to this, high-affinity interactions
with low-abundance proteins are considered as most relevant for target
identification.14 Although BfrB and RplJ
fall into top 5% of the high-abundance mycobacterial proteins, FabG1
(data for FabG4 are currently unavailable) has a relatively low abundance,
falling within top 10% of the proteome.25 Moreover, expression of BfrB may be induced nonspecifically by hypoxia26 or certain antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides.27 Similarly, ribosomal proteins may also get overexpressed
by stress.24 These results and considerations
prompted us to converge on FabG4 as the putative target for S-S006-830. This convergence found support from the comparative
proteome analysis of compound-sensitive and compound-resistant Mtb.
FabG4, and not BfrB or RplJ, was found overexpressed in the membrane
of the resistant bacilli.

Assays to validate FabG4 as a target
for S-S006-830
addressed the functional implications of binding of compound to the
target. To begin with, we saw a 2-fold increase in the MIC of S-S006-830 for an Mtb construct overexpressing FabG4. Second,
in view of its role in FAS-II pathway, binding of FabG4 to the compound
was expected to curtail the production of mycolic acids. We observed
a dose-dependent reduction in all species of mycolic acids, although
the reduction was not as steep as that caused by INH. This difference
in activity could be reconciled with the fact that INH targets multiple
enzymes of the FAS-II pathway, including InhA, which is crucial for
the final step of mycolic acid synthesis.28 The third set of validation experiments assessed the biofilm-forming
ability of Mtb because FabG4 is specifically overexpressed by Mtb
in the biofilms.19 Prevention of biofilm
formation by S-S006-830 suggested that inhibition
of FabG4 could cause a paucity of lipids (including mycolic acids)
in the extracellular matrix required for biofilm formation.16 Results of molecular docking experiments also
validated FabG4 as the target for the compound. In addition, the difference
in binding free-energy scores of the two enantiomers was consistent
with the observed higher antitubercular activity of S-S006-830.

For several reasons, FabG4 qualifies as a unique
drug target against
TB. Mtb genome has five fabG genes, but only two of them (G1 and G4)
are conserved across the mycobacterial species, including the leprosy
pathogen M. leprae.29 A distinctive feature of FabG4 is that it falls in the
category of “high molecular weight” FabGs (molecular
weight, 46.83 kDa), whereas the other four FabGs are of “low
molecular weight” (mol. wt. ranging from 27.14 to 25.67 kDa).
In addition, FabG4 is highly specific for NADH as a cofactor, whereas
the low-molecular-weight FabGs utilize NADPH. In mycobacteria, FabG4
belongs to an operon possibly involved in a nonconventional processing
of fatty acids.30 Indeed, functional complementation
in the yeast has demonstrated that FabG4 can participate in fatty
acid biosynthesis.31 However, there is
scanty data on the role of FabG4 in processing of fatty acids, as
most available studies are focused on FabG1.32 There are also reasons to believe that FabG4 could serve as a target
against latent TB infection (LTBI) as it is expressed in the lungs
of guinea pigs during the chronic phase of infection.33 Besides, FabG4 remains active in the acidic pH range 5.5–6.018 representing the milieu of the phagolysosome,
the intracellular niche of Mtb during latent or chronic infections.34 Hence, by targeting FabG4, S-S006-830 may also act against LTBI. In an earlier report, we have
shown that S006-830 can cure mice of an acute as well as persistent
infection with M. fortuitum.3

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
the S-enantiomer is
the most active species of the antitubercular compound S006-830. It
exhibited a synergistic or additive activity with the frontline TB
drugs. The target identification and validation assays pointed to
FabG4 as the most likely target for S-S006-830. Nonetheless,
the simplified view of “one drug, one target” does not
hold true anymore, and the concept of “polypharmacology”,
that is, drugs may need to target several proteins for their effectiveness,
is gaining ground.35 In this respect, a
possible limitation of this study could be that we have not validated
the other two proteins (BfrB and RplJ) pulled down by the compound
as its additional targets. This could be a subject for future investigation
as we make more progress toward developing S-S006-830
as a novel lead against tuberculosis.

Experimental Section
Materials
Details of materials are given in the Supporting
Information, Table S1.

Mycobacteria
The culture of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb) was maintained on Lowenstein–Jensen
medium. Working stocks were prepared by subculturing the bacilli in
Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10% oleic albumin dextrose
catalase (OADC), 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80 (MB broth). Bacilli
in the mid-log growth phase (7–8 days old, OD600 = 0.5–0.6) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended
(20 mg wet wt/mL) in MB broth containing 15% glycerol as a cryopreservative.
The bacterial suspension was stored in aliquots at −80 °C.
Viable counts (colony-forming units, cfu) were determined by plating
the bacteria (50 μL, diluted in MB broth) on MB 7H11 agar supplemented
with 10% OADC and 0.5% glycerol (MB agar) and incubating (37 °C)
until countable colonies appeared (3–4 weeks).

Preparation
of S006-830 Racemate and Enantiomers
S006-830
racemate was synthesized as described earlier4 (Supporting Information, Figure S1).
The enantiomers were purified by supercritical fluid chromatography
on a chiral column (Chiralcel OJ-H column, Daicel Corp., Japan). The
optimized protocol comprised a mobile phase of 0.5% isopropanol in
methanol, with a flow rate of 2.5 mL/min, temperature of 35 °C,
and detection wavelength of 233 nm.

Assay for Activity against
Mtb
Activity against Bacilli in Broth Culture
Stock solutions
of drugs and test compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and
stored at −20 °C. For determination of in vitro activity,
a stock of Mtb was thawed and inoculated in the assay tubes (∼5
× 105 cfu/mL of MB broth/tube) containing drug or
the test compound. Drug-free tubes served as controls. All tubes were
incubated (37 °C) up to 7 days. For cfu determinations, serial
10-fold dilutions of bacilli were spread on MB agar plates (50 μL/plate)
and incubated for 3–4 weeks. Minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) was the lowest concentration of a drug/compound that inhibited
≥99% of the Mtb growth (in terms of cfu) seen in drug-free
tubes. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the lowest concentration
of a compound that killed ≥90% of the bacilli in initial inoculums.

Activity against Intracellular Bacilli
The study protocol
was approved by CDRI’s Animal Ethics Committee. Mouse bone
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared as follows. Bone
marrow cells from femurs and tibia of Swiss mice were harvested in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) by flushing
out the marrow using a syringe. Cells were collected by centrifugation
(1000g, 15 min) and resuspended in “complete
medium” (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 15% culture supernatant
of L929 cells, and 1% nonessential amino acids). After counting, the
cells (2 × 106/mL) were dispensed in 48-well culture
plates and incubated for 5 days in a CO2 incubator (37
°C, 5% CO2) for adherence and maturation. Approximately
6% of the input cells got adhered and >95% of the adherent cells
showed
positivity for the macrophage marker CD11b, as determined by flow
cytometry.

For intracellular (ex vivo) killing experiments,
thawed Mtb stock was diluted in complete medium without antibiotics.
Aggregated bacilli were dispersed by a short pulse (10 s) of sonication,
which did not affect their viability (ascertained by cfu counts).
The matured BMDM were infected (3 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2) with Mtb using a multiplicity of infection (MOI; bacilli/macrophage)
of 5. Later, the macrophage monolayer was washed extensively with
DMEM to remove extracellular bacilli. Drugs and test compounds (diluted
in complete medium) or medium alone were dispensed in respective wells
(350 μL/well), and plates were incubated in a CO2 incubator for further 5 days. For intracellular cfu determinations,
the cells were lysed with saponin (0.1%, 100 μL/well, 15 min)
and the lysates, after diluting in complete medium, were plated on
MB agar and incubated for 3–4 weeks.

Assay for Drug–Drug
Interactions
Interactions
between frontline TB drugs and test compound were determined by two-drug
checkerboard method,36 with some modifications.
Briefly, in a 96-well “U” bottom plate, the test compound
(in MB broth) was serially diluted vertically and TB drug was diluted
horizontally so as to obtain their various combinations. The bottom
row (row H) of the plate contained dilutions of drug alone, and column
11 contained dilutions of compound alone. Column 12 was used for drug-free
culture (control). Final volume per well was 100 μL. Mid-log
phase culture (OD600 = 0.1, equivalent to ∼107 bacilli/mL) of Mtb was added to the plate (100 μL/well).
All assay plates were incubated in the CO2 incubator for
2–3 weeks before reading for macroscopic bacterial growth.
MIC was the lowest concentration of a drug/compound that produced
no visible growth of the bacilli in inoculums (by this criteria, the
MIC became equivalent to MBC). Fractional inhibitory concentration
(FIC) and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were calculated
as follows: FIC = MIC of a drug in combination/MIC alone; FICI = FIC
of drug A + FIC of drug B. FICI values of ≤0.5 indicate synergistic
activity, of ≥4.0 indicate antagonistic activity, and in between ≤4.0
and ≥0.5 indicate an additive interaction.37

Assay for Time-Kill Kinetics
Kill
kinetics was determined
by the cfu assay.36 Briefly, dilutions
of compound alone or in combination with drugs were prepared in MB
broth (4.5 mL/tube). Mtb culture in MB broth was added (0.5 mL/tube,
final count = 5 × 105 cfu/mL), and tubes were incubated
(37 °C) in a shaker incubator. At different time points (0, 2,
4, 6, and 8 days), 50 μL of 10-fold dilutions of Mtb suspension
was plated on MB agar and incubated until countable colonies appeared
(3–4 weeks).

Generation of S-S006-830-Resistant
Mtb and
Isolation of Subcellular Proteins
Mtb resistant to the test
compound was generated by plating wild-type bacilli on MB agar containing
4× and 8× MIC of the compound and incubating for 4 weeks.
Visible colonies were picked from 4× MIC plate and subcultured
in MB broth containing 4× MIC of the compound. The compound-resistant
bacilli prepared in this manner did not show cross resistance to the
frontline TB drugs rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), and ethambutol
(EMB), as determined by the proportion assay.38

Subcellular protein fractions of the wild-type or compound-resistant
Mtb were prepared according to a previously described method.21 In brief, a suspension of Mtb in the “sonication
buffer” (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM
PMSF, and 1 mM NaN3, pH 7.4) was pulse-sonicated for 20
min. The sonicate was centrifuged at 23 000g for 20 min to settle the cell wall debris and unbroken bacilli.
The supernatant was recentrifuged at 150 000g for 90 min to obtain the cell membrane (sediment) and cytosol (supernatant).
Protein was estimated by a modified Lowry method39 and both fractions, in aliquots, were stored at −20
°C.

Identification of the Drug Target(s) by Chemical Proteomics
Affinity
Chromatography Using Matrix-Bound Test Compound
A steroid
drug compound (SDC) immobilization method that works on
the concept of the Mannich condensation reaction40 was used and the kit manufacturer’s protocol was
followed. In this formaldehyde-mediated reaction, the compound gets
covalently bound to DADPA through condensation of its active hydrogen.
In brief, 4 mL of beads (of 50% slurry) covalently linked with DADPA
was taken in a 15 mL “V” bottom tube and centrifuged
(700g, 2 min). After removing the supernatant, the
resin was washed (5 times) with 4 mL of 50% ethanol/SDC coupling buffer,
and 2.5 mL (5 mg/mL) of test compound dissolved in the coupling buffer
was added to the resin. To it, 200 μL of coupling reagent was
also added. The tube was sealed and incubated (37 °C, 24 h) with
endover mixing. The reaction buffer was removed by centrifugation
and the resin was washed (10 times) with 1:1 mixture of SDC wash buffer
and ethanol. The affinity matrix thus prepared was stored at 4 °C.

In a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube, 200 μL of affinity matrix
was equilibrated with the sonication buffer containing 4% CHAPS. Working
dilution of Mtb membrane (2 mg protein/mL) was also made in the same
buffer, and 1 mL of it was mixed with the resin and incubated (4 °C,
overnight) with endover mixing. Later, the resin was washed (4 times)
with sonication buffer containing 0.06% CHAPS to remove the unbound
or loosely bound proteins. To ascertain that all unbound proteins
were removed, the protein content of washes as well as resin-bound
proteins were monitored by SDS-PAGE using 12% gel.

Protein Identification
by Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis
(2-DE) Followed by Mass Spectrometry
For 2-DE,41 150 μL of resin-bound proteins (slurry)
was solubilized in 150 μL of sample solubilization medium (7
M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% carrier ampholytes, 1% dithiothreitol,
10% isopropanol, and 5% glycerol). After centrifugation (12 000
rpm, 10 min), 150 μL of clear supernatant was applied to an
IPG strip (pH 4–7) and left overnight for rehydration. Isoelectric
focusing (IEF) of the rehydrated strips was performed in a Protean
IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) using a three-step gradient, with the following
parameters: maximum voltage, 2500; maximum current, 50 μA/strip;
total volt hour, 10 000. Later, the strips were equilibrated
(for 15 min each) in solutions “A” (0.05 M Tris–HCl,
pH 8.8, containing 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 1% DTT) and
“B” (solution A without DTT, but with 4% iodoacetamide
and 0.005% bromophenol blue). The strips were loaded on top of SDS-polyacrylamide
gel slabs (12% gel) and electrophoresis was performed at a constant
current of 15 mA. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G250 and destained
with water. Gel imaging was performed on Gel Doc EZ imaging system
(Bio-Rad).

Protein spots in gel were punched out and processed
for identification by LC-MS-MS analysis.42 In brief, gel plugs were destained and washed (in 25 mM ammonium
bicarbonate in 50:50 acetonitrile/water), vacuum-dried, and trypsin-digested
(12.5 mg/mL trypsin, 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, overnight at 37 °C).
The tryptic peptides were extracted with acetonitrile containing 1%
trifluoroacetic acid (20 min, 2 cycles). The extracts were dried by
rotary evaporation and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI MS) using Shimadzu Prominence nano HPLC system (Shimadzu) coupled
to a 5600 Triple TOF mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). Peptides were loaded
onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 3.5 μM column and separated
with a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. Spectra
were analyzed to identify proteins using the Mascot sequence matching
software (Matrix Science) and MSPnr100 database.

Identification
of Drug Target(s) by Comparative Proteomics
Aliquots of 200
μg lyophilized membrane protein of Mtb (wild-type
or compound-resistant) were solubilized in 175 μL of solubilization
medium and subjected to 2-DE, as described above. Spots of interest
were picked, and the corresponding proteins were identified by LC
MS-MS, as described above.

Validation of the Identified Target (FabG4)
MIC
Assay Using Mtb Overexpressing the Target Protein
The fabG4
gene of Mtb was amplified using the primer pair FP 5′-CGAGGATCCGTGGCTCCCAAGCGTTCGTC-3′ and RP 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACGCGCCGATCATGGCC-3′ containing BamHI and HindIII sites (highlighted in bold letters)
as described18 and ligated into shuttle
vector pMV261 and transformed into E. coli DH5α. The fabG4 recombinant plasmid and vector control pMV261
were electroporated (ECM 399 Electroporation System, BTX from VWR)
into competent cells of Mtb.43 The transformed
cells were plated on MB agar containing kanamycin (KM, 30 μg/mL).
The transformants were grown in MB broth containing 30 μg/mL
of KM.

To confirm the overexpression of FabG4, whole cell lysates
of wild-type Mtb, Mtb::pMV261-fabG4 and Mtb::pMV261 were resolved
by 2-DE and FabG4 protein was identified by ESI MS-MS, as per the
protocol described above.

The sensitivity of Mtb strains (wild
type, wild type::pMV261, and
wild type Mtb::pMV261-fabG4) for the test compound and anti-TB drugs
was determined by the MIC assay (described above).

Assay for
Cell Wall Mycolic Acids
To study the effect
of the compound on mycolic acid biosynthesis, a previously described
method was used.44 Drug dilutions were
incubated (37 °C for 15 h) with log-phase culture of Mtb (OD600 ∼1.5) in 15 mL screw-capped culture tubes. Later,
1 μCi/mL of [14C]acetate (56 mCi/mmol) was added
to each tube. Following incubation for another 8 h at 37 °C,
the [14C] labeled cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and sterilized by autoclaving. The lipids in cell sediments
were hydrolyzed by adding 2 mL of tetra-n-butylammonium
hydroxide and incubating overnight at 100 °C. Fatty acids were
esterified by adding 4 mL of CH2Cl2, 300 μL
of CH3I, and 2 mL of distilled water and mixing (at room
temperature, RT) for 1 h. After centrifugation, the upper phase was
discarded and the samples were washed twice with distilled water.
The lower phase was dried and resuspended in 3 mL of diethylether.
After centrifugation, the organic phase was dried and lipids were
resuspended in 200 μL of CH2Cl2. Equal
counts were loaded on a silica gel 60 F254 thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) plate and resolved using hexane/ethyl acetate (19:1, v/v, 2
runs). To detect radiolabeled mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs),
TLC plates were exposed to a phosphor screen (Bio-Rad) and visualized
using a Typhoon Trio imager (GE Healthcare). Densitometry was performed
on scanned phosphor screen images using the ImageJ image analysis
tool.45 Arbitrary numbers were obtained
from each experimental condition with reference to the corresponding
untreated control. Further, the percentage of the value measured in
untreated control was calculated and presented as histograms.

Assay
for Inhibition of Biofilm Formation
Biofilm inhibition
assay was performed as described,16 with
some modifications. In brief, Mtb was grown in MB broth until the
OD600 reached 0.8–1.0 (∼1 week). The culture
was centrifuged (8000 rpm, 15 min), and the pellet washed with PBS.
Final sediment was resuspended in Sauton’s liquid medium (without
Tween). Drug dilutions, prepared in Sauton’s medium, were dispensed
in a 12-well culture plate (4 mL/well). Mtb culture (final OD600 = 0.1) was also dispensed in the same plate (0.5 mL/well).
Wells without drug (with vehicle) served as control. The plate was
sealed with parafilm and incubated for 5 weeks in a CO2 incubator. Formation of biofilm was monitored visually.

Determination of Crystal Structure of S-S006-830
and Computational Studies
Crystal Structure Determination
Single crystals of
the pure enantiomer were grown from methanol solvent by slow evaporation
method at RT. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies were performed
on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer using the Cu Kα radiation.
Full X-ray crystallographic data collection and structure refinement
details are provided in the Supporting Information, Table S2. Crystallographic data have been deposited with the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC deposition number 1543553).

Molecular Electrostatic Potential Surface Calculations
Geometric
optimization of S-S006-830 was performed
using density functional theory at M062X/6-311++g (d,p) level of the
theory.46 Local maxima and minima on the
molecular electrostatic potential mapped on the electron density isosurface
(isovalue = 0.002 e/bohr3) were determined
using Multiwfn software (version 3.3.9).47 Electrophilic and nucleophilic sites on the molecule were determined
using the method described.48

Molecular
Docking
The crystal structure of the Mtb
FabG4–NAD+–hexanoyl-CoA complex was retrieved
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3VIU). The FabG4 structure was corrected for
missing atomic data, alternate locations, breaks (missing loops),
protonation site adjustment, missing H-atom addition, and charge neutralization
before performing modeling studies using MOE software suite.49 This was followed by sequential minimization
of atoms belonging to solvent, side chain, backbone, receptor, and
finally the whole system.

Probable active sites suitable for
ligand binding on the FabG4 were identified by the Alfa Shapes method
using the MOE site finder module. Active sites were ranked based on
“propensity for ligand binding (PLB)” score determined
on the basis of size, accessibility, and exposure to solvent molecules.
Molecular docking studies were performed using the induced-fit model,
using the MOE dock module. Initial poses (total 30 poses/molecule)
were generated using the triangle matcher method and scored using
the London dG scoring function. These poses were subject to rescoring,
and top five poses were selected using an induced-fit model using
the generalized Born volume integral/weighted surface area (GBVI/WSA)
dG scoring function.50

Statistical
Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed
using Microsoft Excel 2010 and GraphPad prism. Significance level
(p < 0.05) of differences was determined by two-tailed
Student’s t-test.
