Novel gel polymer
electrolyte membranes with excellent thermal
stability are fabricated via a combination of physical blending and
chemical cross-linking procedures. Precursor porous membranes made
of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polystyrene–poly(ethylene
oxide)–polystyrene (PS–PEO–PS) triblock copolymer
composites are prepared by a phase-inversion technique, and the gel
polymer electrolyte membranes are finished by in situ hypercrosslinking
of the PS segments in precursor membranes. The latter cross-linking
procedure could consolidate pore configuration and thus greatly enhance
the thermal stability of the obtained cross-linked composite membranes.
The membranes with optimal PS/PEO ratios can retain reasonable porosity
with little dimensional shrinkage at high temperatures up to 260 °C.
Gel polymer electrolytes with these cross-linked membranes as matrices
exhibit much higher ionic conductivities (up to 1.38 × 10–3 S cm–1 at room temperature) than
those based on pure PVDF membranes. Li/LiFePO4 half cells
assembled with these gel polymer electrolytes exhibit good cycling
performance and rate capability. These results indicate that the Friedel–Crafts
reaction based hypercrosslinking is an efficient method to construct
highly heat-resistant polymer electrolytes for lithium ion batteries,
particularly advantageous in applications that require high-temperature
usage.

Introduction
With ever-growing demands
for portable electronic devices, electric
and hybrid vehicles and green energy storage, rechargeable lithium
ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density and long cycle life
have widely been regarded as one of the most important energy storage
systems.1−3 However, rare but sometimes catastrophic safety accidents
associated with the use of flammable liquid electrolytes and commercial
polyolefin separators in LIBs have caused great concerns in the whole
society.4 Furthermore, although LIBs are
usually used in ambient environment, it is also of great importance
to develop LIBs that can be used at higher temperatures in specific
areas such as oil drilling, mining, military, and aerospace electronics.5 In recent decades, polymer electrolytes have
attracted more and more attention because of their advantages over
conventional liquid electrolytes, such as higher safety, mechanical
flexibility, and better processability.6,7

At present,
there are mainly two types of polymer electrolytes:
solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs).
Solvent-free SPEs are normally formed by ion-conducting polymers complexed
with lithium salts; however, low ionic conductivity (10–7–10–5 S cm–1) and poor
compatibility with electrodes severely restrict their application
in batteries. Compared with SPEs, GPEs formed by holding liquid electrolytes
in polymer frameworks could essentially combine the advantages of
both SPEs and liquid electrolytes, such as high ionic conductivity,
good compatibility with electrodes, and reliable safety. A variety
of polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),8,9 poly(methyl
methacrylate),10,11 poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF),12,13 and polyacrylonitrile,14,15 have been used as matrices
for GPEs due to their good interaction with lithium ions and polar
liquid electrolytes. Among the above materials, PVDF as a polymer
matrix for GPEs has attracted significant interest because of its
high dielectric constant, good mechanical stability, and stable electrochemical
performance. However, PVDF as a single component cannot hold enough
amount of liquid electrolyte due to its semicrystalline structure,
resulting in low ionic conductivity and electrolyte leakage issues
of PVDF-based GPEs.16

To tackle these
problems, linear and star-shaped PEO polymers were
blended with PVDF, and porous GPEs based on these blends exhibited
much higher ionic conductivity at room temperature due to their less
crystalline structure and improved pore configuration.12,13 However, PEO derivatives which tend to swell in polar liquid electrolytes
could cause some dimensional and mechanical stability issues, and
their low melting points also restrict the GPEs’ usage at high
temperature.17 Cross-linking is an efficient
method to enhance the mechanical and thermal stabilities of GPEs.
GPEs based on semi-interpenetrating polymer networks composed of a
PVDF matrix and PEO containing cross-linking moieties were prepared
and exhibited much improved thermal stability and ionic conductivity.18,19 However, conventional thermal or irradiation-induced cross-linking
is highly energy consuming and might cause either unwanted side reactions
or damage to the polymeric structures.20 Therefore, it is still of great importance to develop more effective
and milder cross-linking methods to prepare high-performance GPEs
with good thermal stability.

Herein, we utilize a well-established
cross-linking approach, which
involves Friedel–Crafts reaction of aromatic molecules or polymers
containing aromatic building blocks, to prepare a series of novel
cross-linked GPE membranes that show excellent thermal stability.
Previously, this method has been used to synthesize microporous hypercrosslinked
polymers, which have been extensively used in gas storage and separation.21−23 Briefly, precursor porous membranes composed of blends of PVDF and
PS–PEO–PS triblock copolymers were prepared via a phase-inversion
technique, followed by in situ hypercrosslinking of the polystyrene
(PS) segments in the triblock copolymers, forming highly heat-resistant
porous composite membranes. PEO segments in the triblock copolymers
could improve the compatibility between PVDF and PS–PEO–PS
copolymers in the blending and phase-inversion procedures, ensuring
that the cross-linked PS–PEO–PS triblock copolymers
could disperse uniformly in the PVDF matrix to form a semi-interpenetrating
network, which helps in consolidating the pore configuration at elevated
temperatures. The effect of PS chain length on thermal properties
and electrochemical performances of the cross-linked gel polymer electrolytes
(CPEs) was investigated, and it was found that with optimal PS/PEO
ratios, the CPE membranes could retain reasonable porosity with little
dimensional shrinkage at high temperatures up to 260 °C, which
are indeed among the most thermally stable GPE membranes reported
up to now and would be highly advantageous for LIBs used in harsh
conditions. When conducted into test batteries, the CPEs exhibit much
higher ionic conductivity (1.38 × 10–3 S cm–1) and better electrochemical performances than those
based on pure porous PVDF membranes.

Results and Discussion
The synthetic route of the PS–PEO–PS triblock copolymers
(SES-1–SES-5) is shown in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). Using the same macroinitiator (MI) made
from a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer (Mn = 8000 g mol–1), PS–PEO–PS
triblock copolymers with different PS chain lengths SES-1–SES-5
were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction
with different MI/styrene feed ratios. The chemical structures of
the Br–PEO–Br macroinitiator and PS–PEO–PS
copolymers are verified by 1H NMR (Figure S1) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra
(Figure S2). Molecular weights and structural
compositions of the PS–PEO–PS copolymers are summarized
in Table 1, wherein
the molecular weights of the PS segments were calculated from the
integration ratios in the 1H NMR spectra, and polymer dispersity
indexes (PDIs) of the copolymers were determined by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) measurement. As shown in Table 1, the PS–PEO–PS copolymers
possess molecular weights ranging from 11 000 to 56 000
g mol–1 with narrow molecular weight distributions
and a wide range of PEO/PS composition ratios. The molecular weights
of the copolymers determined by GPC exhibit the same trend as the
results from NMR calculation (Table S1).

d PDI was obtained from GPC using
tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the mobile phase and PS as the standard sample.

The fabrication process of
the cross-linked polymer composite membranes
is illustrated in Scheme 1. The precursor porous membranes were prepared by a phase-inversion
technique using glycerin as the nonsolvent.13,24 Thus, PVDF and PS–PEO–PS copolymers (w/w = 4:1) were
completely dissolved to form a homogeneous solution in a mixture of N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) and glycerin (v/v = 10:1). During
the evaporation of NMP at 90 °C, the glycerin molecules gathered
into droplets, and uniformly dispersed in the solid-state membranes
because of the strong interaction between PEO segments of the copolymers
and glycerin. The porous precursor membranes were obtained after glycerin
was completely removed at a higher temperature. Subsequently, the
precursor porous membranes were in situ cross-linked in a solution
of cross-linking agents containing formaldehyde dimethylacetal (FDA)
as the cross-linker and FeCl3 as the catalyst, during which
PS segments in the PS–PEO–PS copolymers underwent a
fast Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction.25 The cross-linked polymer composite membranes were obtained
after extensive washing and drying under vacuum. There was little
change in the shape and dimension of the membranes during the cross-linking
process. The solubility of the precursor membranes and cross-linked
membranes in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and NMP
was studied. The precursor membranes without cross-linking could be
completely dissolved, whereas for cross-linked membranes, there was
always some insoluble residue that could be the hypercrosslinked PS–PEO–PS
copolymers. For comparison, pure PVDF porous membranes without cross-linking
were also manufactured by the phase-inversion technique.

Process of Heat-Resistant Porous Polymer Membranes
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface areas (SAs)
of the cross-linked membranes were analyzed by nitrogen sorption analysis,
and the results are summarized in Table 2. The BET surface area of the pure PVDF membrane
was unmeasurable. With the introduction of PS–PEO–PS
triblock copolymers, the cross-linked composite membranes of CPE-1,
CPE-2, CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5 exhibit BET surface areas of 18.3,
46.6, 38.2, 116.4, and 152.8 m2 g–1,
respectively. It is clear that with an increase in the length of the
PS segments in the copolymers, the BET surface areas of the resulting
cross-linked membranes gradually increase, probably due to the production
of micropores during the hypercrosslinking process.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S3) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) (Figure S4) measurements were conducted to understand the thermal
properties of pure PVDF and the cross-linked membranes. All of the
DSC curves show an endothermic peak at 160 °C, which corresponds
to the melting of PVDF. TGA results show that the pure PVDF membrane
starts to thermally degrade near 400 °C, and the weight loss
of cross-linked membranes starts near 300 °C, indicating the
thermal degradation of the copolymer.

The morphology of the
pure PVDF membrane and the cross-linked membranes
was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (Figures 1 and 2). From the surface and cross-sectional images, we can see that the
membranes of CPEs have denser pore distribution than the pure PVDF
membrane, especially for the membranes of CPE-1, CPE-2, and CPE-3,
which possess relatively higher PEO/PS composition ratios. However,
when the PS segments in the copolymers become larger, the pore distribution
of membranes of CPE-4 and CPE-5 becomes sparser and the pore sizes
increase. The possible reason is that phase separation between PVDF
and PS–PEO–PS copolymers could occur upon further increasing
the length of the PS chain in the added copolymers because of the
incompatibility between PVDF and PS, leading to glycerin gathering
in the PS–PEO–PS phase.12,13,26

Porosities of the porous membranes calculated by n-butanol absorption at room temperature are summarized
in Table 2. The membranes
prepared
with PVDF/PS–PEO–PS composites exhibit higher porosities
than pure PVDF, and the cross-linking procedure has no significant
effect on the porosities (Table S2). The
membranes of CPE-1, CPE-2, and CPE-3 have high porosities of about
64%, and the porosities of membranes of CPE-4 and CPE-5 decreased
to 58.3 and 49.8% due to the phase separation between PVDF and PS–PEO–PS
copolymers; the electrolyte uptake values of the porous membranes
are also shown in Table 2, and the results are directly related to the porosity and affinity
with liquid electrolytes. The cross-linked membrane of CPE-2 with
the highest porosity (64.4%) and relatively high content of PEO segments
shows the highest electrolyte uptake of 201%. To understand the effect
of cross-linking on the thermal stability of the membranes, both the
precursor membranes and cross-linked membranes were placed onto a
hot plate for heat treatment at each temperature (from 120 to 300
°C) for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature for porosity
measurement. The results are shown in Figure 3. With an increase in temperature, the porosities
of all of the membranes decrease due to the melting of PVDF. When
the temperature is increased to 200 °C, all of the precursor
membranes without cross-linking are completely shut down, similar
to the thermal behavior of pure PVDF (Figure S5); however, the cross-linked membranes still showed variable porosities,
from 10% of CPE-5 to over 35% of CPE-4. Further increasing the temperature
to 260 °C, the membrane of CPE-4 still exhibits the highest porosity
of close to 35%, which was comparable to the porosity of commercial
polyolefin-based Li-ion battery separators at room temperature.27 At an even higher temperature of 300 °C,
the cross-linked membranes of CPE-2, CPE-3, and CPE-4 still show porosities
of about 20%. The SEM images of the cross-linked membranes after heat
treatment at 300 °C (Figures S6 and S7) also show that the polymer matrices of CPEs were partially melted,
and the open pores still exist.

(top half) and cross-linked
membranes (bottom half) of CPE-1, CPE-2, CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5 under
heat treatment at different temperatures from 120 to 300 °C.

A polymer electrolyte must maintain
its dimension at an elevated
temperature to prevent direct contact between positive and negative
electrodes. To evaluate thermal dimensional stability, thermal shrinkage
behaviors of the cross-linked membranes, pure PVDF membrane, and commercial
PP separator were recorded after placing the membranes onto a hot
plate at 180 and 260 °C for 1 h, respectively (Figure 4). At 180 °C, the PP separator
exhibited serious dimensional shrinkage, and the pure PVDF membrane
was fully melt down and became transparent. In direct contrast, the
cross-linked membranes of CPEs showed no obvious dimensional shrinkage.
When the temperature reached up to 260 °C, the PP separator was
thermally decomposed. The membranes of CPE-1 and CPE-2 exhibited a
certain degree of thermal shrinkage, and there was still little dimensional
shrinkage for cross-linked membranes of CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5. It
is clear that the greater the degree of cross-linking, the better
the thermal dimensional stability. This, combined with the sustained
porosity of CPE membranes at high temperature, shows that the cross-linking
procedure could consolidate pore configuration and thus greatly enhance
the thermal stability of the obtained cross-linked composite membranes.
There are substantial research interest and market demand for electrical
energy storage that operates at high temperature for use in the oil
and gas (60–200 °C) industry, military, aviation, aerospace,
and the automotive and electric vehicle sectors (up to 300 °C).5 We believe that the CPE membranes with excellent
thermal dimensional stability and stable pore configuration at elevated
temperatures show great potential in high-temperature electrical energy
storage.7

and membranes of pure
PVDF, CPE-1, CPE-2, CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5 before and after thermal
exposure at 180 and 260 °C for 1 h (When the temperature reached
260 °C, the decomposed PP separator on the bottom left was completely
stuck on the aluminum foil and cannot be removed.).

Alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy
was used to measure
the ion conductivities of the PVDF porous membrane and the CPEs. Figure 5a shows the Nyquist
plots of CPEs at room temperature. It can be seen that the bulk impedance
of pure PVDF is the largest, and the impedance of the CPEs increases
when the PS chain length is elevated. The ion conductivities of pure
PVDF and CPEs at room temperature were calculated and are shown in Table 2. Pure PVDF has the
lowest ion conductivity of 0.074 × 10–3 S cm–1 due to its low porosity and semicrystalline structure,
which is not favorable for lithium ion transport.18 CPE-1 and CPE-2 have similar ion conductivities of 1.34
× 10–3 and 1.38 × 10–3 S cm–1, which agree with their almost the same
porosity and electrolyte uptake. When the PS chain length further
increases, the ion conductivities of CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5 decline
gradually due to their decreasing porosity and less content of PEO
segments. Figure 5b
shows the dependence of ionic conductivity on temperature ranging
from 30 to 80 °C.

Figure 5 (a) Nyquist plots at room temperature, and (b) temperature
dependence
of ionic conductivity for PVDF, CPE-1, CPE-2, CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5.

All of the curves of CPEs are
nearly linear, and the ion conductivities
increase with an increase in temperature because of the stronger lithium
ion mobility at a higher temperature, which presents typical Arrhenius
conductive behavior. The activation energy for ion transportation
of the CPEs can be calculated from the equation σ = σ0 exp(−Ea/RT), where σ is the measured ion conductivity, and
σ0 and R are the pre-exponential
factor and gas constant, respectively. The slope was obtained from
the log σ–1000/T curves in Figure 5b. The Ea values for pure PVDF and CPEs are shown in Table 2. The Ea value of pure PVDF (34.73 kJ mol–1) is much higher than that of CPEs (14–17 kJ mol–1) because of its low porosity and semicrystalline structure.

The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test was carried out to evaluate
the electrochemical stability window of the CPEs. As shown in Figure 6, there is no obvious
oxidation peak in the wide potential range from 0 to 5.0 V (vs Li/Li+), demonstrating that the CPEs have an electrochemical stability
window of 5.0 V (vs Li/Li+), and no apparent difference
is observed in the electrochemical stability among different CPEs.

sweep voltammetry curves for PVDF, CPE-1, CPE-2, CPE-3,
CPE-4, and CPE-5.

The charge–discharge
performances of lithium ion batteries
with different CPEs as the gel electrolytes were evaluated by using
LiFePO4 as the cathode and Li metal as the reference electrode.
Cycling performances of the cells are shown in Figure 7a. The cells assembled with pure PVDF with
a semicrystalline structure and low porosity exhibit the lowest initial
discharge specific capacity of 125.3 mA h g–1. The
batteries containing CPE-1, CPE-2, CPE-3, and CPE-4 show high initial
discharge specific capacities of 145.3, 138.4, 133.8, and 140.4 mA
h g–1 at 0.1C, respectively. However, the discharge
specific capacity of the cell containing CPE-5 (128.2 mA h g–1) is relatively lower, which may be caused by its low porosity and
electrolyte uptake.28 After 40 cycles,
the cell containing pure PVDF shows a capacity retention of 78.1%
and the discharge capacity retention values of cells containing CPE-1,
CPE-2, CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5 are 95.5, 100, 97.5, 90.7, and 87.7%,
respectively. Capacity retention of the cells is determined by the
ion conductivity and affinity with liquid electrolyte, which allows
better electrolyte retention during cycling.12,29,30 With the addition of PS–PEO–PS
copolymers, which enhances the ionic conductivity and the affinity
with liquid electrolytes, the CPEs show better cycling performances
than pure PVDF. Among them, CPE-1, CPE-2, and CPE-3 exhibited superior
capacity retention, and when the PS chain length of the added copolymers
further increases, the ionic conductivities and the content of PEO
segments in the CPEs decrease, resulting in lower capacity retention.
As shown in Figure S8, the overpotentials
of cells assembled with CPE-1–CPE-4 are smaller than that of
the cell assembled with PVDF, indicating a smaller polarization effect.
The highly reversible capacities between charge and discharge processes
for cells assembled with CPE-1–CPE-3 indicate the good stability
of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Among them, CPE-2 with a
low overpotential and a highly reversible capacity is expected to
be a good candidate for gel polymer electrolytes.

Figure 7 (a) Cycling performance
and (b) C-rate performance of Li/LiFePO4 batteries assembled
with PVDF, CPE-1, CPE-2, CPE-3, CPE-4,
and CPE-5.

Although the discharge capacity
of the cells decreases when the
discharge rate increases from 0.2C to 2C due to the sluggish Li ion
diffusion kinetics at high rates, the cells assembled with CPE-1 and
CPE-2 show relatively higher discharge capacity than others at each
rate, as shown in Figure 7b, indicating that they have better rate properties.31 The cell using CPE-2 exhibits capacities of
131.6, 114.4, 99.1, and 79.2 mA h g–1 at rates of
0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, and the capacities at each rate of the cell
containing pure PVDF are 106.8, 95.1, 78.8, and 58.3 mA h g–1, respectively. When the current density increases from 0.2C to 2C,
the capacity retention values of the cells containing pure PVDF and
CPE-2 were 54.6 and 60.0%, respectively. The better rate performances
of the cells assembled with CPEs than pure PVDF might benefit from
higher ion conductivities and better affinity with the liquid electrolyte,
which allows faster transportation of lithium ions at high charge–discharge
rates.30,32 The first cycle charge–discharge
curves of the cells at different C-rates are shown in Figure S9. It also shows that the cells assembled
with CPEs have higher initial efficiency than PVDF at each rate. In
addition, with an increase in the C-rates from 0.2C to 2C, the charging
plateau increases, whereas the discharging plateau continuously decreases,
indicating the increase in battery resistance and polarization. Compared
with the cell assembled with pure PVDF, CPEs exhibit relatively smaller
voltage platform changes, indicating better rate performances of the
composite polymer electrolytes.

Conclusions
In
summary, novel cross-linked gel polymer electrolytes based on
PVDF and PS–PEO–PS triblock copolymers were prepared
by combining the phase-inversion technique and the in situ hypercrosslinking
procedure. The as-prepared membranes exhibit high porosity and uniform
pore size, and the cross-linking procedure consolidates pore configuration
and thus greatly enhances the thermal stability of the obtained composite
membranes. The membranes with optimal PS/PEO ratios could retain reasonable
porosity with little dimensional shrinkage at high temperatures up
to 260 °C, which are indeed among the most thermally stable GPE
membranes reported up to now. GPEs with these cross-linked membranes
as matrices exhibit much higher ionic conductivities (up to 1.38 ×
10–3 S cm–1 at room temperature)
than those based on pure PVDF membranes. Moreover, half cells assembled
with CPEs show much better cycling performances and rate capability
than pure PVDF. These results indicate that Friedel–Crafts
reaction-based hypercrosslinking is an efficient method to construct
highly heat-resistant gel polymer electrolytes for lithium ion batteries,
particularly advantageous in applications that require high-temperature
usage.

LiFePO4 powder (battery-grade), and acetylene black were
purchased from Shanxi Lizhiyuan Battery Materials Co. Ltd.

Preparation
of the Triblock Copolymers
The PS–PEO–PS
triblock copolymers were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization
(ATRP) using the Br–PEO–Br macroinitiator (MI) according
to a literature procedure.33 A series of
copolymers were synthesized with the MI/CuBr/PMDETA/St molar ratios
of 1:2:3:30, 1:2:3:50, 1:2:3:100, 1:2:3:200, and 1:2:3:460 and were
labeled as SES-1, SES-2, SES-3, SES-4, and SES-5, respectively.

Preparation of Precursor Porous Membranes
PVDF/PS–PEO–PS
porous membranes were prepared by a phase-inversion technique. 4 g
of PVDF and 1 g of PS–PEO–PS copolymer were dissolved
in a mixture of NMP (solvent, 35 mL) and glycerin (non-solvent, 3.5
mL). The mixture was heated under vigorous stirring at 80 °C
for 24 h until a homogeneous solution was obtained. After being cooled
to room temperature, the solution was poured into a Petri dish and
placed on a hot plate at 90 °C for 4 h to remove NMP, and then
placed in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 24 h to remove the glycerin.
The free-standing membranes were cut into circular pieces (d = 16 mm) before use.

Preparation of Cross-Linked
Gel Polymer Electrolytes
FeCl3 (4.875 g), FDA
(2.65 mL), and 20 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane
were added to a flask and stirred in an ice bath until it is completely
mixed. PVDF/PS–PEO–PS (500 mg) precursor membranes were
added to the mixture and then heated at 80 °C for 24 h without
stirring. At the end of the reaction, the obtained membranes were
washed with acetone, 1 M hydrochloric acid, and deionized water successively,
purified by a Soxhlet extractor with methanol for 24 h, and finally
dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. The resulting membranes
were immersed in a liquid electrolyte solution in a glove box before
being conducted into lithium batteries. For convenience, the in situ
cross-linked gel polymer electrolytes are labeled as CPE-1, CPE-2,
CPE-3, CPE-4, and CPE-5, corresponding to the samples prepared with
SES-1, SES-2, SES-3, SES-4, and SES-5, respectively.

Characterization
NMR (Bruker 400 MHz) and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet 6700) were used to examine the
chemical structures of the copolymers. Polymer dispersity indexes
(PDIs) of the copolymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC, Waters 2695) using THF as the mobile phase and PS as the standard
sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7500F) was used
to characterize the morphology of the CPE membranes. Specific surface
areas of the samples were measured by a gas adsorption analyzer (Belsorp-Max).
The thermal properties of the membranes were evaluated by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC, Perkin Elmer DSC 8500) and thermogravimetry
analysis (TGA, Perkin Elmer STA 6000) under a nitrogen atmosphere
with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1.

To
measure porosity, the membranes were immersed into n-butanol for 4 h until equilibrium was achieved at room temperature.
The porosity (P) was calculated according to the
following equation 1  where m1 and m0 are the weights of the membrane saturated
with n-butanol and dry membrane, respectively, ρ
is the density of n-butanol, and V0 is the geometric volume of the membrane.

Electrolyte
uptake of the membranes was calculated according to
the following equation 2  where W0 is the
weight of dry membrane, and W1 is the
weight of the membrane after absorbing the liquid electrolyte.

Ionic conductivity of the CPEs was determined by AC impedance spectroscopy
using an electrochemical workstation system (CHI660e, Shanghai Chenhua
Instruments Co., Ltd., China) at an amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency
range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. By sandwiching the polymer electrolytes
between two stainless steel electrodes, the bulk impedance (Rb) could be measured. The ion conductivity (σ)
can be calculated using the following equation 3  where d is the
thickness
of the polymer electrolytes, and S is the effective
area between electrolytes and stainless steel blocking electrodes.

The electrochemical stability window of CPEs was measured by the
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at room temperature using a two-electrode
cell with a stainless steel working electrode and a lithium foil reference
electrode. The measurement was carried out between 0 and 6.0 V (vs
Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 1 mV s–1.

The CPEs were sandwiched between the LiFePO4 cathode
(LiFePO4/acetylene black/PVDF, 8:1:1, w/w/w) and the lithium
metal anode in a coin cell to analyze their battery performance, including
the charge–discharge curve, cycling property, and C-rate capability.
The charge–discharge curve was obtained at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C,
1C, and 2C between 2.5 and 4.2 V. The cycling property of the cells
at room temperature was conducted in a Land battery test system (CT
2001A, Wuhan Land Electronic Co. Ltd.) at a current density of 0.1C
between 2.5 and 4.2 V. The rate capability was tested under current
densities of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C for six cycles at each rate at
room temperature. All of the cells were assembled in an argon-filled
glove box with oxygen and moisture level <1 ppm.
