The
drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which is encoded by MDR1 (ABCB1), plays important roles in
drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. We previously reported
that dietary polyphenols such as quercetin, curcumin, honokiol, magnolol,
caffeic acid phenetyl ester (CAPE), xanthohumol, and anacardic acid
inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport. In the present study,
we investigated the effects of polyphenols on the expression of P-glycoprotein
using human intestinal epithelial LS174T cells and a reporter plasmid
expressing 10.2 kbp of the upstream regulatory region of MDR1. Honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, and anacardic acid activated
the MDR1 promoter in LS174T cells, and the cellular
uptake of rhodamine 123 and calcein-AM, fluorescent substrates of
P-glycoprotein, decreased in polyphenol-treated LS174T cells. These
results suggest that dietary natural polyphenols can induce the drug
efflux transporter P-glycoprotein and have the potential to promote
food–drug interactions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
P-glycoprotein, the protein
encoded by the MDR1 (ABCB1) gene,
is a membrane transport protein expressed
in the intestine, liver, kidney, placenta, and blood–brain
barrier. P-glycoprotein mediates the cellular elimination of a wide
variety of chemically unrelated drugs, including verapamil, digoxin,
tacrolimus, clarithromycin, fexofenadine, and saquinavir. Therefore,
human P-glycoprotein plays important roles in drug absorption, distribution,
and elimination, and these effects ultimately determine drug efficacy
and toxicity.1−4 For example, P-glycoprotein acts as a biochemical barrier in the
apical membrane of enterocytes to restrict the absorption of orally
administered drugs. Many clinically significant P-glycoprotein-mediated
drug–drug interactions have been reported.1−4 We previously reported that multiple
dietary natural polyphenols, including bioflavonoid quercetin, kaempferol,
tea catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), curcumin, capsaicin,
[6]-gingerol, resveratrol, sesamin, glycyrrhetinic acid, guggulsterone,
and carnosic acid, inhibit the function of P-glycoprotein in P-glycoprotein-overexpressing
human carcinoma cells.5−11

Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of fiber, vitamins,
and minerals. They also contain various natural polyphenols that can
provide substantial health benefits beyond basic nutrition.12−14 Epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that
natural polyphenols can reduce the risk of cancer.12−14 The nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor and the pathways
that control NF-κB activation play critical roles in the regulation
of inflammation and oncogenesis.15,16 Several polyphenols,
including EGCG, curcumin, capsaicin, guggulsterone, honokiol, magnolol,
caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), xanthohumol, anacardic acid,
thymoquinone, emodin, aloe-emodin, anethol, and eugenol, block NF-κB
activation, thereby acting as chemopreventive agents in cancer.12−14

Multidrug resistance is a phenomenon characterized by the
resistance
of tumors to a wide spectrum of anticancer drugs, and it represents
a significant obstacle to the success of cancer chemotherapy. P-glycoprotein
is a transporter overexpressed in the membrane of multidrug-resistant
cancer cells.1−3 The overexpression of P-glycoprotein renders cancer
cells resistant to a variety of commonly used, pharmacologically unrelated
anticancer drugs, including vinblastine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin,
imatinib, irinotecan, and paclitaxel, by actively eliminating these
drugs. Therefore, natural compounds that inhibit both NF-κB
activation and anticancer drug efflux transporters might enhance the
efficacy of chemotherapy. We recently examined the effects of natural
polyphenols reported to inhibit NF-κB activation on the function
of human P-glycoprotein. Several of these natural NF-κB inhibitors,
including honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, and anacardic acid,
abolished multidrug resistance by inhibiting P-glycoprotein.17

It is well-established that many drugs
and xenobiotics induce the
expression of P-glycoprotein.4,18,19 The antibiotic rifampicin enhances the expression of P-glycoprotein
in human enterocytes and inhibits the absorption of orally administered
digoxin.18 Natural polyphenols can also
influence the expression of P-glycoprotein. Ginkgolide B, a terpenoid
isolated from Ginkgo biloba extract,
enhances the expression of P-glycoprotein, whereas curcumin, a yellow
pigment isolated from turmeric (Curcuma longa), inhibits its expression.20,21 In the present study,
we investigated the effects of natural polyphenols known to inhibit
both NF-κB activation and P-glycoprotein function, on the expression
of P-glycoprotein.

2 Results
2.1 Effects
of Polyphenols on MDR1 Promoter Activation
Figure 1 shows the
chemical structures of several of the polyphenols
used in this study. We first tested the effects of polyphenols on MDR1 promoter activation (Figure 2). The promoter construct containing the
entire 10.2 kbp MDR1 promoter region (p-10224MDR)
was used.22 At a concentration of 10 μM,
rifampicin, honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, anacardic acid,
and ginkgolide B activated the MDR1 promoter in LS174T
cells. In contrast, 10 μM thymoquinone, capsaicin, and [6]-gingerol
had little or no effect on the MDR1 promoter. Rifampicin,
honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, and anacardic acid enhanced MDR1 promoter activation in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 2).

LS174T cells transfected with the MDR1 reporter vector were incubated with 5, 10,
or 20 μM polyphenols for 48 h, and luciferase activity was subsequently
analyzed. MDR1 luciferase activity was calculated
using cells incubated with the vehicle (ethanol) as the control. Open
bars: 5 μM, closed bars: 10 μM, and hatched bars: 20 μM.
The data shown represent the mean ± SD of nine measurements from
three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 compared with the control.

The plant sterol guggulsterone is an active substance isolated
from the guggul tree (Commiphora mukul), and it is used to treat hyperlipidemia, obesity, arthritis, and
inflammation.12−14 Brobst et al.23 reported
that guggulsterone activates human pregnane X receptor (PXR) but inhibits
rifampicin-induced PXR activation, indicating that guggulsterone can
function as both an agonist and antagonist of PXR. To investigate
the antagonistic activity of polyphenols, LS174T cells were treated
with 10 μM polyphenols for 1 h and further incubated with 10
μM rifampicin for 47 h. Honokiol, xanthohumol, and anacardic
acid significantly enhanced rifampicin-induced MDR1 promoter activation (Figure 3), indicating that honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol,
and anacardic acid exert agonistic, rather than antagonistic effects
on the MDR1 promoter.

Figure 3 Effects of polyphenols

in the presence of rifampicin. LS174T cells transfected with the MDR1 reporter vector were incubated with 10 μM polyphenols
for 1 h. Then, the cells were incubated with 10 μM rifampicin
for 47 h, and luciferase activity was subsequently evaluated. MDR1 luciferase activity was calculated using cells incubated
in the medium without polyphenol or rifampicin as the control. The
data shown represents the mean ± SD of nine measurements from
three independent experiments. **P < 0.01 compared
with rifampicin only.

As honokiol activates retinoid X receptor α (RXRα),24 we examined the effects of PXR or RXRα
on polyphenol-induced MDR1 promoter activation. The
cells were treated with honokiol, magnolol, or ginkgolide B in the
presence or absence of a vector expressing human PXR (pSG5-hPXR) or
human RXRα (pCMX-hRXRα).25,26 PXR significantly
enhanced honokiol-, magnolol-, and ginkgolide B-induced MDR1 promoter activation (Figure 4).

activation. LS174T cells were transfected with the MDR1 reporter vector in the presence or absence of a vector expressing
human PXR or RXRα. Transfected cells were incubated with 10
μM polyphenols for 48 h, and luciferase activity was subsequently
analyzed. MDR1 luciferase activity in cells transfected
in the absence of a vector expressing human PXR or RXRα incubated
in the absence of polyphenols was defined as 1. Closed bars: absence
of human PXR or RXRα, hatched bars: human PXR, and open bars:
human RXRα. The data shown represent the mean ± SD of six
measurements from three independent experiments. **P < 0.01 compared with cells transfected in the absence of a vector
expressing human PXR or RXRα. ††P < 0.01 compared with cells transfected in the presence of a vector
expressing human PXR incubated in the absence of polyphenols (control,
+PXR).

of Polyphenols on P-Glycoprotein mRNA
and Protein Expression
Figure 5 shows the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
and western blot analyses of P-glycoprotein in the LS174T cells incubated
with 10 μM polyphenols for 48 h. Rifampicin and honokiol significantly
increased the mRNA and protein expression.

2.3 Cellular
Uptake of Fluorescent P-Glycoprotein
Substrates in Polyphenol-Treated LS174T Cells
Rhodamine 123
is a fluorescent P-glycoprotein substrate, and calcein-acetoxymethyl
ester (calcein-AM), an acetoxymethyl ester of calcein, is a nonfluorescent
human P-glycoprotein substrate.1 When calcein-AM
crosses the membrane, cytosolic nonspecific esterases immediately
convert it into the highly fluorescent compound calcein. The uptake
of rhodamine 123 and calcein-AM decreased in cells treated with rifampicin,
honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, or anacardic acid, indicating
that these polyphenols induced P-glycoprotein expression (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Uptake of rhodamine 123
or calcein-AM in polyphenol-treated LS174T
cells. LS174T cells were incubated with 10 μM polyphenols for
96 h. Then, the cells were washed and further incubated with 20 μM
rhodamine 123 or 1 μM calcein-AM for 1 h at 37 °C. Uptake
was calculated as the percent of the vehicle (ethanol) control. Closed
bars: rhodamine 123 and open bars: calcein-AM. The data shown represent
the mean ± SD of nine measurements from three independent experiments.

3 Discussion
Honokiol and magnolol are lignans isolated from the stem and bark
of Magnolia officinalis and Magnolia obovata that are used in traditional Japanese
and Chinese medicines. They are also used as dietary supplements and
have been shown to exhibit anticancer, antiarthritic, and antiinflammatory
properties.12−14 CAPE, an active component of honey bee hive-derived
propolis, possesses anticarcinogenic, antimitogenic, and antiinflammatory
properties. Xanthohumol, a prenylated chalcone isolated from hops
(Humulus lupulus), is reported to inhibit
NF-κB activation and exhibit anticancer properties. Anacardic
acid (6-pentadecylsalicylic acid), a compound isolated from cashew
nuts (Anacardium occidentale), exhibits
anticancer and antiinflammatory properties. Thymoquinone (2-isopropyl-5-methylbenzoquinone),
the most active component of black cumin (Nigella sativa) seed oil, exhibits antioxidant, anticancer, and antiinflammatory
properties. Capsaicin, a pungent component of hot chili pepper (Capsicum annuum), is a suspected carcinogen or cocarcinogen
based on its irritant properties in experimental animal models. However,
some reports indicate that capsaicin exerts chemopreventive effects.12−14 [6]-Gingerol, a phenolic substance responsible for the spicy taste
of ginger (Zingiber officinale), exhibits
antioxidant, anticancer, and antiinflammatory effects.12−14 The findings of the present study indicate that honokiol, magnolol,
CAPE, xanthohumol, and anacardic acid activate the MDR1 promoter in human intestinal LS174T cells in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2).
In contrast, thymoquinone, capsaicin, and [6]-gingerol had little
or no effect on the MDR1 promoter. The accumulation
of P-glycoprotein substrates decreased in cells incubated with the
natural polyphenols honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, and anacardic
acid (Figure 6).

We previously reported that incubation of 50 μM honokiol,
magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, and anacardic acid for 1 h increased
the accumulation of fluorescent P-glycoprotein substrates in human
P-glycoprotein-overexpressing KB/MDR1 cells.17 In contrast, thymoquinone, emodin, aloe-emodin,
anethol, and eugenol had no effects on P-glycoprotein function, despite
reports that they also inhibit NF-κB activation. We previously
analyzed the effects of natural polyphenols on the activation of NF-κB
by cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α using a NF-κB response
element fused to a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid.17 The strength of the inhibitory effect of polyphenols
on NF-κB activation ranked as follows: CAPE > xanthohumol
>
anacardic acid, and the inhibitory effect of polyphenols on P-glycoprotein
function ranked as follows: magnolol > anacardic acid > honokiol
>
CAPE > xanthohumol.17 In the present
study,
we examined the effects of 48 h incubation of natural polyphenols
on the MDR1 promoter. The ability of the polyphenols
to activate the MDR1 promoter ranked as follows:
honokiol > CAPE > xanthohumol > anacardic acid > magnolol
(Figure 2). Therefore,
there
appears to be no correlation between the effects of polyphenols on
NF-κB activation and the function and expression of P-glycoprotein,
and the mechanisms underlying the effect of polyphenols on NF-κB
and P-glycoprotein are different.

The nuclear receptor PXR plays
a key role in the regulation of
P-glycoprotein expression.4,19,22,27 PXR can be activated by a broad
range of drugs and xenobiotics, including rifampicin, paclitaxel,
dexamethasone, phenobarbital, and ginkgolide B.4,19,20,22,25−27 Activated PXR forms a heterodimer
with RXRα and binds to a cluster of DNA response elements in
a region between bp −7975 to −7013 in MDR1, thereby inducing gene transcription.22 Rifampicin activated the MDR1 promoter and increased
the mRNA and protein expression in LS174T cells (Figures 2 and 5), and the uptake of P-glycoprotein substrates decreased in cells
incubated with rifampicin for 4 days, indicating that P-glycoprotein
was effectively induced (Figure 6). Satsu et al.20 demonstrated
that ginkgolide B activated the MDR1 promoter and
increased the mRNA and protein expression of P-glycoprotein. We confirmed
that ginkgolide B activated the MDR1 promoter, and
this effect was enhanced by exogenously expressed PXR (Figures 2 and 4). Similar to ginkgolide B, honokiol activated the MDR1 promoter, and this effect was enhanced by exogenously expressed
PXR (Figures 2 and 4). Honokiol also increased the mRNA and protein
expression, and the uptake of P-glycoprotein substrates decreased
in cells incubated with honokiol (Figures 5 and 6). Honokiol
and magnolol activated the MDR1 promoter, but the
effects on the mRNA and protein expression of magnolol were less than
those of honokiol. More studies on the structure–activity relationship
are needed.

Honokiol, xanthohumol, and anacardic acid enhanced
rifampicin-induced
activation of the MDR1 promoter, and none of the
polyphenols examined inhibited rifampicin-induced promoter activation
(Figure 3). Kotani
et al.24 reported that the methanol extract
of Magnolia obovata activated RXRα
and that honokiol functioned as an RXRα agonist. We evaluated
the effect of PXR or RXRα on honokiol- and magnolol-induced
activation of the MDR1 promoter (Figure 4). Human PXR, but not human
RXRα, significantly enhanced honokiol- and magnolol-induced
activation of MDR1, indicating that the activation
of the MDR1 promoter by these polyphenols is primarily
mediated by PXR.

Xu et al.28 and
Han and Van Anh29 reported that honokiol
decreased P-glycoprotein
expression in P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant ovarian
cancer MCF-7/ADR (re-designated NCI/ADR-RES) cells. These results
could be associated with PXR-independent and/or cell-type-specific
mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanism
of P-glycoprotein expression in different tissues.

Geick et
al.22 reported that 10 μM
rifampicin activates the MDR1 promoter in LS174T
cells, and Satsu et al.20 demonstrated
that 100 μM rifampicin and 10, 50, and 100 μM ginkgolide
B induced P-glycoprotein expression in LS180 cells. On the basis of
these findings, we selected 10 μM as the concentration of polyphenols
to use in the study. The concentration of some polyphenols is higher
in dietary supplements than in commonly consumed foods. For example,
magnolia bark extract capsules with 8 mg of honokiol (30.04 μmol)
are available as dietary supplements.

In conclusion, the MDR1 promoter was activated
by natural polyphenols, honokiol, magnolol, CAPE, xanthohumol, and
anacardic acid in human intestinal LS174T cells. Human PXR enhanced
honokiol-induced MDR1 promoter activation. Honokiol
increased the mRNA and protein expression of P-glycoprotein, and the
uptake of P-glycoprotein substrates decreased in honokiol-treated
LS174T cells. Together, these results suggest that natural polyphenol
honokiol can induce the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein and
have the potential to modulate the pharmacokinetics of drugs.

The
promoter construct containing the entire 10.2 kbp MDR1 promoter region (p-10224MDR) was kindly provided by Dr. Oliver Burk
(Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart,
Germany).22 The vectors expressing human
PXR (encoded by NR1I2), pSG5-hPXR, and human RXRα
(encoded by RXRA), pCMX-hRXRα, were kindly
provided by Prof. Steven Kliewer (University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, Dallas, TX).23,24

4.2 Cell
Culture
LS174T cells (CL-188)
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). The cells were cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 ng/mL streptomycin. The cells were incubated
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and
95% air.

4.3 Luciferase Assay
LS174T cells (1
× 105 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates and
cultured for 24 h. Then, the cells were transiently transfected with
300 ng of MDR1 promoter firefly luciferase plasmid
(p-10224MDR) and 200 ng of the control HSV-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (pGL4.74) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in the
presence or absence of 50 ng of the vector expressing human PXR or
RXRα (pSG5-hPXR or pCMX-hRXRα, respectively) using FuGENE
HD transfection reagent (Promega) for 24 h. Then, the cells were incubated
with 5, 10, or 20 μM polyphenols for 48 h. The cells were lysed
using Promega Reporter Lysis Buffer. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using a Dual-Glo
Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and GloMax-20/20 luminometer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Firefly luciferase activity
was normalized to Renilla luciferase
activity. The MDR1 luciferase activity was calculated
using cells incubated with the vehicle (ethanol) as the control.

4.4 Real-Time PCR and Western Blot Analysis
Reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR assay was performed
using a CellAmp Direct SYBR RT-qPCR Kit and a Thermal Cycler Dice
Real Time System TP-800 (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The specific primer pairs
used for human MDR1 and β-actin (ACTB) were as follows: MDR1, 5′-ATGTCACCATGGATGAGATTGAGA-3′
and 5′-TGGCGATCCTCTGCTTCTG-3′; ACTB, 5′-ACCGAGCGCGGCTACA-3′ and 5′-CAGCCGTGGCCATCTCTT-3′.
The threshold cycle (CT) value for each
mRNA was determined using the crossing point method. The relative
mRNA levels of MDR1 were normalized to ACTB as follows: CT(MDR1) – CT(ACTB)
= ΔCT. Then, the relative mRNA levels
of MDR1 after polyphenol treatment were calculated
using the ΔΔCT method: ΔΔCT = ΔCT(polyphenol)
– ΔCT(vehicle). The fold
changes in mRNA levels of MDR1 upon polyphenol treatment
were expressed as 2–ΔΔCT.

Cell lysates were prepared using Laemmli sample
buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue. Protein concentrations
were measured using a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). Then, 2-mercaptoethanol
(final concentration 5% (v/v)) and bromophenol blue (final concentration
0.005% (w/v)) were added to the sample. The protein samples (3 μg
protein/lane) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN
TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and Can Get Signal immunoreaction enhancer solution
(Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal
C219 (Enzo Life Sciences) against human P-glycoprotein (1:100), horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat polyclonal antimouse IgG (1:5,000,
Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA), and HRP-conjugated
mouse monoclonal AC-15 (ab49900, Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK) against
human β-actin (1:200 000). Immunostar Zeta (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries Ltd.) was used for chemiluminescent detection
of proteins with ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Little
Chalfont, UK). Protein levels of P-glycoprotein were determined using
the ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) and normalized
to β-actin.

4.5 Measuring the Total Cellular
Uptake of Fluorescent
P-Glycoprotein Substrates
LS174T cells were seeded in 24-well
plates incubated with 10 μM polyphenols for 96 h. After 96 h
incubation, the medium was aspirated and washed to remove the remaining
polyphenol. Polyphenol-treated cells were incubated with 20 μM
rhodamine 123 or 1 μM calcein-AM for 1 h at 37 °C, and
the medium was subsequently aspirated. Then, the cells were washed
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 0.1%
Triton X-100 in PBS. Fluorescence intensity of rhodamine 123 and calcein-AM-derived
calcein in the cells was measured using a DTX 880 microplate fluorometer
(Beckman Coulter, Inc., Indianapolis, IN, USA) with excitation and
emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Protein concentrations
were measured using the detergent-compatible bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
method and a TaKaRa BCA protein assay kit (Takara Bio Inc.). Bovine
serum albumin was used as the standard. Fluorescence intensities were
normalized to protein concentrations. The uptake was calculated as
the percent of the vehicle (ethanol) control.

4.6 Statistical
Analysis
The data are
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical
significance of differences was determined using one-way analysis
of variance followed by Dunnett’s test. P values
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
