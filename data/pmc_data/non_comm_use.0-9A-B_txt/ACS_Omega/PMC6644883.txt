1-Phenylethanol (PhE) is widely employed
in the pharmaceutical
industry as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug, as well as in
chewing gums and yogurts as a food additive. In this work, we have
investigated the selective synthesis of 1-phenylethanol (PhE) by hydrogenation
of acetophenone using supercritical CO2 as a solvent. Supercritical
carbon dioxide (scCO2) replaces organic solvent because
it is inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, inert, and environmentally
benign. Polyurea-based encapsulated mono- and bimetallic catalysts
were synthesized and characterized using different characterization
techniques. The effects of various reaction parameters, such as co-solvent,
catalyst loading, hydrogen pressure, total scCO2 pressure,
and temperature, were studied to determine the reaction kinetics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
the past few decades, supercritical fluids (SCFs) have attracted
considerable attention as reaction media. SCFs are some is of the
new types or classes of fluids whose properties lie in between gases
and liquids and which can be manipulated very easily by altering the
pressure and temperature. This fluid medium has the capability to
control the reaction environment with precision and to tune the selectivity.
Among all SCFs, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has
received special attention because organic solvents in the reaction
can be easily replaced with scCO2 as it is nontoxic, nonflammable,
inexpensive, and easy to dispose and recycle. It can also serve as
a nonpolar solvent by manipulating its solvent strength over a wide
range of polarities.1−3 Reactions such as hydroformylation and hydrogenation,
which are diffusion-limited in the normal solvent phase, can be boosted
in the scCO24,5 because diffusivities in it are
higher and viscosities are lower compared to conventional solvents.

The selective reduction of carbonyl group by means of heterogeneous
catalysts is an essential step in industrial organic chemistry.6,7 Acetophenone (AP) is one of the interesting compounds because its
hydrogenation pathway gives a variety of products and byproducts due
to the consecutive and competitive hydrogenation of the aromatic ring
and the carbonyl function. Thus, it has become an ideal model compound
for chemoselective hydrogenation reactions. 1-Phenylethanol (PhE)
is one of the desired products used in pharmaceuticals as an intermediate
compound for anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs,8 whereas in the food industry, it is used as additives in
chewing gums and yogurts because of its typical strawberry scent.9

The main reason behind selecting this catalytic
reduction is not
only because aromatic keto compounds are essential in the synthesis
of the pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and cosmetics industries,
but also because the complex reaction pattern of this multistep reaction
can be a useful tool to test the selectivity and activity properties
of a catalytic system. Many heterogeneous catalysts employing Ru,
Pd, Cu, Pt, Ni, and Ti metal catalysts are reported at a wide range
of operating temperatures and pressures, with many of them involving
“standard” supported noble metal catalysts in organic
solvents.10−14

In many drug synthesis processes, hydrogenation is the final
step,
where contamination of the final product by catalyst leaching or traces
of solvent is very challenging. The catalyst used for hydrogenation
contains toxic metals, which are harmful to human health, and the
very high grade of end purity required for pharmaceutical drugs would
require an expensive and lengthy purification of the final product.
To overcome the above difficulty of drug contamination by leached
catalyst and/or solvents and to design a benign medium to synthesize
drugs in compliance with the principles of green chemistry,15 synthesis processes based on SCFs and ionic
liquids as green solvents for reactions16,17 and extractions18 are emerging as a substitute for the replacement
of standard volatile organic compounds.19,20

Microencapsulation
is the method of entrapping a metal or material
into a polymeric coating or shell.21,22 Recently,
the use of microencapsulation in catalyst has been exploited.23,24 Generally, in a transition-metal-supported catalyst, the metal is
coordinated to a ligand, which is covalently bound to a polymeric
backbone or sometimes adsorbed on an inert surface, such as carbon
or silica. These catalyst systems are very often referred to as “supported”
or “polymer-anchored” catalysts. These polymer-anchored
catalysts are produced by copolymerization method, which is very tedious,
lengthy, and expensive. The use of interfacial microencapsulation
to immobilize homogeneous catalysts was reported by Ley and co-workers,25 suggesting that it might solve the challenging
limitations of previous approaches. In this method, microcapsules
are prepared by an in situ interfacial polymerization method, which
involves a dispersion of organic phase containing polyfunctional monomers/oligomers
(along with the material to be encapsulated) into an aqueous phase,
which contains a mixture of emulsifiers and protective colloid stabilizers.
This gives oil-in-water emulsion, which undergoes in situ interfacial
polymerization, with the monomers/oligomers reacting spontaneously
at the phase interface to form microcapsule walls. One can easily
tune the coordinating properties of the polymer material and the permeability
and size of these microcapsules by varying other reagents, the nature
of monomers/oligomers, and the encapsulation conditions used in the
procedure. For efficient entrapment of transition-metal-based catalysts,
we need to design systems having ligating functionality to retain
the metal species.26 These systems should
be chemically inert and physically robust to reaction environment
although also being economical. The presence of a backbone of urea
functionality in polyurea microcapsules was found to be a suitable
chemical structure to ligate and retain metal species (e.g., Pd(OAc)2).21 The polyurea-encapsulated
catalyst was used in reductive Heck coupling,21 Suzuki reactions,21,27 hydrogenation,28 transfer hydrogenation,29,30 ring-opening
epoxidation, and nitroreduction.31 Polyurea-encapsulated
catalysts have good leaching resistance in reaction media due to their
ability to ligate to the catalyst metal.21,27,31

This work deals with the synthesis
and characterization of polyurea-encapsulated
mono- and bimetallic catalysts. This work is also delved with a detailed
hydrogenation of acetophenone in the presence of an encapsulated catalyst
using scCO2 as the reaction medium. Thus, the idea of using
scCO2 as solvent came forward, keeping enhancement of conversion
and selectivity in mind. Experimental results were acquired by varying
the operational conditions (catalyst, temperature, H2 pressure,
CO2 pressure) and using three different co-solvents (methanol,
ethanol, and 2-propanol). Results were inferred by kinetic modeling.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemicals
Acetophenone,
methanol,
ethanol, 2-propanol, toluene, hexane, ruthenium chloride hydrate,
copper acetate, toluene diisocyanate, sodium dodecasulfonate (SDS),
ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
400 were obtained from SD Fine Chemicals Ltd., Mumbai, India. Pd(OAc)2 was procured from Monarch Catalyst Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India.
All chemicals used in this study were analytical-grade reagents and
used without further purification. Hydrogen and liquid CO2 cylinder were obtained from Industrial Oxygen Co., Ltd., Mumbai,
India.

2.2 Catalyst Synthesis
The catalysts
were synthesized by the interfacial polymerization method31,32 and further modified in our laboratory for polyurea-based encapsulated
catalysts, namely, Pd(PdEnCat), Pd-Ru(Pd-RuEnCat), and Pd-Cu(Pd-CuEnCat).33,34

The synthesis of polyuria-based encapsulated catalyst involves
two steps: making organic-phase and aqueous-phase solutions. Organic-phase
solution was prepared by dissolving palladium acetate (0.1 g) in toluene
(2 mL) at 70 °C under stirring, followed by addition of surfactant
Aliquat 336. Once dissolution of palladium acetate was complete, toluene
diisocyanate (3.66 gm) was added and the solution stirred to make
it homogeneous. The aqueous-phase solution was prepared by dissolving
72 mg of sodium dodecasulfonate (SDS), 50 mg of PEG 400, and 0.15
g of copper acetate monohydrate in deionized water (20 mL). Further,
diethylene triamine (0.72 g) and ethylene diamine (0.68 g) were added
in 1:1 molar ratio to this solution and stirred until homogenized.
Amines are used to increase the cross-linking and functionalize the
ligation of the metal. This increase in cross-linking due to higher
amines gives mechanical properties to the polymeric beads.31 The organic-phase solution of palladium was
added dropwise over the aqueous-phase solution of copper at a temperature
below 5 °C to prevent polymerization reaction and to form stable
oil-in-water microemulsion of proper size. Once microemulsion was
formed, the temperature was increased to 45 °C and the emulsion
was kept under vigorous stirring for 16 h. The encapsulated catalyst
was formed, which was then filtered and subsequently washed with water,
ethanol, and hexane three times. Catalyst reduction was done in the
reactor at 15 bar hydrogen pressure and 100 °C for 4 h with ethanol
as solvent. The yield of the catalyst was 98% based on metal encapsulated
in the polymeric bead.

2.3 Catalyst Characterization
The catalyst
was characterized using various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction
(XRD) for the determination of crystalline nature of the polymer,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the determination
of adsorbed species, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for textural
determination, and physical appearance of catalyst surface and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) for surface elemental analysis.

Infrared
spectra of the samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer instrument with
reference to blank potassium bromide pellet in each sample. These
spectra were collected at 2 cm–1 resolution and
between 400 and 4000 cm–1 wavelengths.

XRD
patterns of the catalyst recorded on a Bruker instrument (λ
= 0.1541 nm) at room temperature were used to interpret the crystalline
nature of the catalyst. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive
spectroscopy data for catalyst were obtained on a JEOL JSM-6380LA
microscope operated at 10 kV, 1 nm resolution, and 2.6–8 mm
working distance.

Catalyst pore size distribution, pore volume,
and surface area
were determined by multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods on Micromeritics
(ASAP-2010) instrument by nitrogen adsorption–desorption. The
catalyst sample was degassed at 150 °C, and analysis was performed
in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of −196 °C.

2.5 Experimental Setup
Reactions under
scCO2 condition were performed in a specially designed
high-pressure reactor (Figure 1A) of 100 cm3 capacity from Thar Technologies,
Inc. The reactor was provided with a magnetic stirrer assembly with
an impeller and a speed controller. The process control package included
a process controller, electrical cartridge heaters, a pressure transducer,
a thermocouple, and an electrical enclosure box mounted on the reactor
stand assembly. It also had an inbuilt video camera to monitor the
phase change. Video overlay kit display was provided with recordings
of date, time, sample number, pressure, set temperature, and actual
temperature. Figure 1B,C shows the images taken by the inbuilt camera, while observing
the phase change of compound under scCO2 in the phase-monitor
(B) and reaction proceedings in the supercritical reactor (C).

2.6 Reaction Procedure
Desired quantities
of the catalyst and reactants were loaded into the reactor system,
which was then closed, flushed three times with carbon dioxide, and
heated to reaction temperature. Then, hydrogen gas was introduced
into the reactor at the desired pressure and liquid carbon dioxide
was pumped into the reactor using a high-pressure liquid pump at the
desired reaction pressure. The reaction mixture was stirred for the
desired time, and the reaction samples were collected at a particular
interval. The reactor was cooled down to room temperature. Gases were
vented carefully, and the liquid reaction mixture was filtered to
separate the catalyst.

2.7 Analytical Method
The reaction samples
were analyzed using a Chemito GC 1000 gas chromatography instrument
with 30 m capillary (BPX-50) columns using a flame ionization detector
and nitrogen as carrier gas. Constant pressure mode of the carrier
gas was used. The detector and injector were kept at 250 °C,
and the oven temperature ramp was programmed from 100 °C/1 min
to 10 °C/min, 120 °C/4 min, 15 °C/min, and 240 °C/1
min. The conversion was calculated based on the disappearance of the
starting material acetophenone using the internal standard method.
The products were identified by GC mass spectroscopy.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Various Catalysts
Various
encapsulated catalysts were studied for the hydrogenation of acetophenone
reaction, including monometallic PdEnCat, bimetallic Pd-RuEnCat, and
Pd-CuEnCat. The catalytic activities for the conversion of acetophenone
and the selectivity of 1-phenylethanol were compared for all of the
catalysts under similar reaction conditions. During hydrogenation
of acetophenone, various products (Scheme 1), such as 1-phenylethanol (PhE), cyclohexylmethylketone
(CHMK), ethylbenzene (EB), and 1-cyclohexyl-ethanol (CHE), were produced,
whose conversion and selectivity profiles are shown in Figure 2. Among all catalysts, Pd-RuEnCat
was found to be more active, with 97% conversion, but less selective,
71% toward the PhE. On the other hand, Pd-CuEnCat showed the highest
selectivity of 95% toward PhE with a reasonable conversion of 85%
and PdEnCat shows the least 70% conversion with 80% PhE selectivity.
Ruthenium metal shows a high capability to reduce the aromatic ring
in acetophenone and hence less selectivity toward synthesizing phenylethanol.35,36 Pd-RuEnCat consisted of precious bimetals, i.e., palladium and ruthenium,
in equal proportion, which makes this catalyst relatively costly.
On the other hand, Pd-CuEncat shows enhanced selectivity to 1-phenylethanol
compared to PdEnCat and Pd-RuEnCat catalysts because copper metal
is the top candidate for selectively making PhE.37 Therefore, Pd-CuEnCat was selected for further study.

of various catalysts on conversion and PhE selectivity.
Acetophenone: 0.05 mol; catalyst loading: 0.015 g/cm3;
temperature: 80 °C; H2 pressure: 20 bar; total CO2 system pressure: 80 bar; reaction time: 4 h; co-solvent (methanol):
25 mL; speed of agitation: 800 rpm.

3.2 Catalyst Characterization
Details
of the catalyst characterization are discussed in the Supporting Information.

3.3 Effect
of the Speed of Agitation
To eliminate the external mass-transfer
resistance, the effect of
speed of agitation on the rate of reaction was studied. The agitation
speed was studied in the range of 600–1000 rpm under otherwise
similar reaction conditions over Pd-CuEnCat, maintaining the temperature
at 80 °C. As can be seen from Figure 3, no substantial change in the overall acetophenone
conversion was observed, indicating that mass-transfer limitation
was absent for the diffusion of hydrogen from the the bulk fluid phase
through fluid−solid film and subsequently to the external surface
of the catalyst. It was quite expected that hydrogen gas is completely
miscible with scCO2. Thus, it was ensured that there is
no influence of external mass-transfer effect under the current experimental
conditions.38 All further experiments were
carried out keeping the agitation speed at 800 rpm.

Figure 3 Effect of the speed of
agitation. Acetophenone: 0.05 mol; catalyst:
Pd-CuEnCat; catalyst loading: 0.015 g/cm3; temperature:
80 °C; H2 pressure: 20 bar; total CO2 system
pressure: 80 bar; co-solvent (methanol): 25 mL.

3.4 Effect of Catalyst Loading
It is
well known that the rate of reaction is directly proportional to catalyst
loading under no influence of external mass-transfer resistance and
internal diffusion limitation. The effect of catalyst loading was
studied in the range of 0.005–0.02 g/cm3 based on
the total volume of the reaction solution. Figure 4 indicates the effect of catalyst loading
on acetophenone conversion. The conversion of acetophenone increases
with increasing catalyst loading due to the proportional increase
in the number of active sites. At very high catalyst loading, the
reaction will be too violent to control.39 Therefore, all further reactions were carried out at optimum catalyst
loading (0.015 g/cm3).

of acetophenone. Acetophenone:
0.05 mol; catalyst: Pd-CuEnCat; temperature: 80 °C; H2 pressure: 20 bar; total CO2 system pressure: 80 bar;
co-solvent (methanol): 25 mL; speed of agitation: 800 rpm.

3.5 Effect of the Partial Pressure
of Hydrogen
The effect of hydrogen pressure on acetophenone
hydrogenation over
Pd-CuEnCat was studied. The catalytic experiments were conducted at
hydrogen pressures of 5, 10, 15, and 20 bar. The obtained conversion
vs time plot is presented in Figure 5. It is observed that the reaction rate increases with
initial hydrogen pressure. At higher pressure, conversion as good
as 85% was obtained. At low hydrogen pressure, the conversion was
low because of the limited hydrogen present inside the reactor. The
total volume of the supercritical reactor used in this work is 100
cm3, and the volume of the feed charge was 30 cm3; therefore, free volume for hydrogen gas was 70 cm3.
Under the reaction conditions of 80 °C and 20 bar pressure, only
0.0483 gmol of hydrogen gas could be accessed in 70 cm3 for the reaction, as shown by the calculations below. Moreover,
for complete hydrogenation of 0.05 mol (5.84 mL) of acetophenone,
0.05 mol of hydrogen is required. Thus, the reaction may inhibit by
insufficient hydrogen at lower pressure, so maximum hydrogen pressure,
i.e., 20 bar was used for the reaction study.    P = 20 bar, V = 70 mL, T = 353 K, and R = 0.082
(bar L/mol K). Hence, n = 0.0483 mol.

Figure 5 Effect of partial pressure

Acetophenone: 0.05 mol; catalyst: Pd-CuEnCat; catalyst loading: 0.015
g/cm3; temperature: 80 °C; total CO2 system
pressure: 80 bar; co-solvent (methanol): 25 mL; speed of agitation:
800 rpm.

3.6 Effect
of Supercritical CO2
The effect of scCO2 on the conversion of acetophenone
was studied. Here, we selected three different conditions: (1) without
CO2; (2) below supercritical region; and (3) under supercritical
condition. The conversion profile, as shown in Figure 6, clearly indicates the effect of CO2 on conversion. The conversion is very low without CO2 and increases with CO2 pressure from subcritical
condition to supercritical condition.

Figure 6 Effect of CO2 pressure on conversion
of acetophenone.
Acetophenone: 0.05 mol; catalyst: Pd-CuEnCat; catalyst loading: 0.015
g/cm3; temperature: 80 °C; H2 pressure:
20 bar; co-solvent (methanol): 25 mL; speed of agitation: 800 rpm.

At low CO2 pressure,
the reaction medium was still in
liquid phase, but the solubility of H2 in the liquid phase
was enhanced and it was more than that without CO2. Therefore,
it gives higher conversion rate than without CO2. Under
the supercritical condition, hydrogen solubility was enhanced further
and it was completely soluble in solution. The effective concentration
of hydrogen in a supercritical CO2 solution can be almost
an order of magnitude higher than that in a conventional solvent.40 As a consequence, hydrogen concentration at
the surface of the catalyst can be significantly increased, which
leads to very high reaction rates compared to the standard liquid-phase
operation. Thus, further reactions were carried out under the supercritical
condition at 80 bar pressure.

3.7 Effect
of Co-Solvent
The effect of
co-solvent on catalyst activity or conversion and the selectivity
for hydrogenation of acetophenone were studied using isopropanol,
ethanol, and methanol. The effect of the above-mentioned solvents
on the evolution of acetophenone conversion as a function of time
is shown in Figure 7. It was observed that the catalyst activity follows the sequence:
MeOH > EtOH > IPA. On the other hand, catalyst selectivity does
not
have any effect on solvent and shows higher than 99% selectivity toward
1-phenylethanol during the complete catalytic runs. The results from Figure 7 notably indicate
that activity of the catalyst for acetophenone hydrogenation depends
on the solvent used in the reaction. The variation of the catalyst
activity with solvent is commonly observed in liquid-phase-catalyzed
reactions, but it is barely explained in terms of simple reaction
parameters.

Figure 7 Effect of co-solvent on conversion of acetophenone. Acetophenone:
0.05 mol; catalyst: Pd-CuEnCat; catalyst loading: 0.015 g/cm3; temperature: 80 °C; H2 pressure: 20 bar; total
CO2 system pressure: 80 bar; speed of agitation: 800 rpm.

In the solid-catalyzed reaction,
the role of the solvent is a very
complex phenomenon due to the fact that the solvent effect may be
related to catalyst–solvent, product–solvent, and reactant–solvent,
interactions, which were well explained in previous works.41,42 The acetophenone conversion rate on the catalyst is clearly higher
in MeOH. Here, we correlate the conversion rate with dielectric constant
(ε), dipole moment (μ), and hydrogen donor capability
(α) of the solvents.43Table 1 indicates that MeOH has higher
dielectric constant and dipole moment than EtOH and IPA. Because of
these reasons, MeOH shows higher conversion rate than EtOH and IPA.
Another reason was hydrogen donor capability, as the solvent with
lower H-bond capability can interact very weakly with acetophenone
(AP). MeOH has higher hydrogen donor capability than EtOH and IPA,
so it interacts strongly and gives higher reaction rate. Because of
this reason, methanol had a higher reaction rate than ethanol and
isopropanol and hence we selected methanol as the co-solvent to conduct
further study.

#	solvent	ε	μ	α	
1	MeOH	32.7	1.70	0.98	
2	EtOH	24.6	1.69	0.86	
3	IPA	19.9	1.66	0.76	
3.8 Effect of Temperature
Experiments
were conducted in the temperature range of 60–80 °C to
study the effect of temperature on the rate of reaction. Figure 8 shows the effect
of temperature on conversion of acetophenone. It was expected that
the reaction rate will improve with an increase in temperature, which
could be due to enhancement in the surface reaction rate constant
at a higher temperature. Also, higher temperature reduced the viscosity
of supercritical carbon dioxide and improved the diffusivity, which
is responsible for the enhancement of the reaction rate.

3.9 Reaction
Kinetics and Modeling
Here,
we had assumed bifunctional catalytic sites S1 and S2. On S1 sites, substrate is chemisorbed, and on
S2 sites, hydrogen is adsorbed.

4 Conclusions
Hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated over polyurea-microencapsulated
mono- and bimetallic catalysts, such as PdEnCat, Pd-RuEnCat, and Pd-CuEnCat,
using supercritical CO2 as solvent. Of these catalysts,
Pd-RuEnCat was found to be more active but less selective toward PhE.
On the other hand, Pd-CuEnCat was found to be superior with 95% selectivity
for the desired product PhE. The effects of various reaction parameters
on the reaction rates using Pd-CuEnCat were studied thoroughly, and
a
kinetic model based on bifunctional catalyst sites was derived, which
showed a very good agreement with the experimental data. The reaction
was found to follow pseudo-first-order mechanism. The activation energy
was found to be 14.8 kcal/mol.
