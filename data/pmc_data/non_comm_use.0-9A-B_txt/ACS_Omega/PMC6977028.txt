The
development of a next-generation DNA sequencer has provided
a method for electrically measuring single molecules. Methods for
electrically measuring one molecule are roughly divided into methods
for measuring tunneling and ion currents. These methods enable identification
of a single molecule of DNA, a RNA nucleotide, or a single protein
based on current histograms. However, overlapping of current histograms
of molecules with similar properties has been a major barrier to identifying
single molecules with high accuracy. This barrier was broken by introducing
machine learning. Combining single-molecule electrical measurement
and machine learning enables high-precision identification of single
molecules. Highly accurate discrimination has been demonstrated for
DNA nucleotides, RNA nucleotides, amino acids, sugars, viruses, and
bacteria. This combination enables quantitative evaluation of molecular
recognition ability. Furthermore, a device structure suitable for
high-precision identification has been designed. Combining single-molecule
electrical measurement with machine learning enables digital analytical
chemistry that can count certain types of molecules. Digital analytical
chemistry enables comprehensive analysis of chemical reactions. This
new analytical method will lead to the discovery of unknown or missed
valuable molecules.

==== Body
Introduction
Disease prevention is an important global
issue. To achieve this,
diseases, including infectious diseases, must be quickly, cheaply,
and accurately diagnosed at an early stage. Ideally, this should occur
before symptoms appear. It is desirable to be able to diagnose cancer
when its cells are small. One candidate for achieving this is a method
for examining the genome in a single cell. For infectious diseases,
it is effective to examine a small number of viruses and bacteria
before these multiply in the body. A method of examining a small number,
ideally a single DNA molecule, virus, or bacterium, is desirable for
early diagnosis. Optical methods such as real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) have
been used to test for diseases, including infectious diseases. Since
smartphones are an integral component of the world’s infrastructure,
an electrical inspection method that can be connected to a smartphone
enables in situ diagnosis.1,2 This
is because on-site measurements can be transferred to a server and
analyzed using a smartphone and the inspection results returned to
the hand. The electrical measurement method can be miniaturized, reduced
in cost, and highly integrated using semiconductor technology. This
measurement method is known as single-molecule electrical measurement.

Single-molecule electrical measurement methods are roughly classified
into nanogap3−5 and nanopore methods.3,5−7 These were originally developed for producing next-generation DNA
sequencers. The nanogap method detects and discriminates analytes
that pass between electrodes with gaps of several nanometers or less
using tunneling currents (Figure 1a).4 The tunneling current
provides information on the electronic state of the analyte and the
analyte–electrode interaction. Particularly, it provides information
on the energy levels of the frontier orbitals that determine the current
path. The tunneling current–time waveform is characterized
by a maximum current (IpT)
and a current duration (tdT).4 Two or more analytes are identified
by an IpT or tdT histogram or an IpT–tdT heat
map. This method has been widely applied to DNA and RNA sequencing,
peptide amino acid sequencing, and identification of modified and
unmodified amino acid molecules.4

electrical measurement method. (a) Nanogap method.
The current–time waveform corresponding to the single molecule
is characterized by a maximum current IpT and a current duration tdT. (b) Nanopore method. The ion current–time waveform
is characterized by the maximum current change IpN and the current duration tdN.

The nanopore method is
classified into two types, bionanopore3 and solid-state nanopore.6,7 Here,
only solid-state nanopores manufactured using semiconductor technology
are targeted. A typical solid-state nanopore has a through-hole in
SiN with a diameter of several micrometers or less (Figure 1b).6 Both sides of the SiN substrate are filled with an aqueous solution
in which the electrolytes are dissolved. When a voltage is applied
between the electrodes installed on both sides, an ion current flows
through the nanopore. When the sample enters the nanopore, the ion
current decreases. The ion current–time waveform is analyzed
using two measured quantities: the maximum change in the ion current
(IpN) and the duration of the
current (tdN). When two or
more analytes are measured, they are identified by an IpN or tdN histogram or an IpN–tdN heat map. This method has been
widely applied to DNA, RNA, and proteins.3,5−7

However, the nanogap and nanopore methods have
a serious problem
in common. In the nanogap method, analytes with similar volumes and
frontier orbital energy levels have similar IpT and tdT histograms. In the solid-state nanopore method, analytes with similar
volumes show similar IpN and tdN histograms. That is, histogram
overlap hinders high-precision identification of two or more analytes.

This problem was overcome by analyzing the tunneling current–time
and ion current–time waveforms using machine learning.8−16 In the field of single-molecule electrical measurement, support
vector machine and random forest are mainly used to handle binary
and multiclass classification problems. So far, in the histogram analysis,
each waveform has been analyzed using the scalar quantities IpT or IpN. In the machine-learning analysis, the waveform is analyzed
with a vector quantity characterizing it. A histogram using IpT shows a one-dimensional data distribution.
An analysis using N features shows an N-dimensional data distribution. For example, in a two-dimensional
map of a certain IpT–tdT, two analytes are not discriminated
(Figure 2a). However,
if two appropriate features are used, the data of the two analytes
may be classified. Machine learning is similar to learning data and
searching for features that classify analytes with high accuracy.
The analysis using machine learning quantitatively evaluates false
positives and false negatives that are practically important. In discriminating
between two analytes, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure are obtained from the confusion matrix (Figure 2b). Each is defined
as follows: accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN); precision =
TP/(TP + FP); recall = TP/(TP + FN); F-measure =
2 × recall × precision/(recall + precision), where TP, TN,
FP, and FN indicate true positive, true negative, false positive,
and false negative, respectively. It should be noted that the evaluation
scale differs depending on the application. Different rating scales
were used as reviewed below. Analysis by machine learning can identify
with high accuracy which sample corresponds to a waveform obtained
by measurement. In this mini-review, we introduce the advantages of
combining the nanogap method, nanopore method, and machine learning.

distribution with feature values IpT and tdT, molecules
A and B are not discriminated with high accuracy. The classifier,

are searched by machine learning. (b) A confusion matrix obtained
by machine learning. The accuracy is calculated from the confusion
matrix. TP, TN, FN, and FP represent true positive, true negative,
false negative, and false positive, respectively. These four numbers
correspond to the number of data points classified by machine learning.

Combination of Nanogap Methods and Machine
Learning
The nanogap method is considered as an ideal principle
for next-generation
DNA sequencers.3,4 It is classified into two types.
One involves modifying an electrode with a molecule that recognizes
an analyte. In this method, a single molecule is identified using
a tunneling current flowing between the modified electrodes through
a single analyte molecule. This current is called the recognition
tunneling (RT) current.8−11 The other method involves using a bare electrode.12 These methods enable identification of a single DNA base
and amino acid molecules.4 Additionally,
the latter approach was used to demonstrate short DNA sequencing and
partial peptide sequencing of short peptides.4

However, the proof of concept of these DNA and peptide sequencers
was mainly based on the histogram analysis of IpT.4 Many researchers
expressed concern that the large overlap of the IpT histograms of the four base molecules and
20 amino acids gave large discrimination errors.4 Histogram-based analysis prompted researchers to stochastically
determine which single molecule a tunneling current–time waveform
was attributed to. Despite the development of single-molecule measurement,
the information obtained from a single molecule could not be handled
directly. Machine learning has overcome this dilemma.

A breakthrough
was achieved by single-molecule identification of
amino acids using the RT method.8 Pd substrate
and Pd electrode surfaces were modified with recognition molecules
(Figure 3a). The modifying
molecule was 4(5)-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1H-imidazole-2-carboxamide
(ICA). Amino acids and modified molecules form hydrogen bonds. When
the amino acids were measured, a spike-shaped tunneling current–time
waveform was obtained (Figure 3b). Using IpT and tdT histograms, it was not possible
to discriminate between two amino acids with high accuracy. Using
the results obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT) of each obtained
waveform, 161 features were generated. A support vector machine (SVM)17 was used as a classifier. Analysis using the
extracted features and SVM enabled high-precision identification of
two amino acids. The discrimination accuracy between leucine (Leu)
and N-methylglycine (mGly) was represented by precision
= 0.95 (Figure 3c).
Analysis using the IpT histogram
only gave an accuracy of precision = 0.58. Surprisingly, the optically
active forms, d-asparagine (Asn) and l-Asn, were
identified with a high accuracy of precision = 0.87. This experiment
demonstrated that two amino acid molecules that cannot be identified
with high accuracy using IpT and tdT histograms can be
identified with high accuracy by analysis using machine learning.
Combining the RT method and SVM realized high-precision single-molecule
discrimination between DNA9 and RNA10 base molecules. Furthermore, high-accuracy single-molecule
identification of sugar was demonstrated.11

Combining the RT method and machine learning enabled quantitative
evaluation of the goodness of the combination of the analyte and the
recognition molecule.9,10 The stabilization energy due
to the interaction between the analyte and the recognition molecule
could be obtained from quantum chemical calculations. The strength
of the interaction could be obtained by measuring the coupling constant.
However, these values are not always an evaluation index of the goodness
of the combination of the analyte and the recognition molecule for
obtaining high discrimination accuracy. When ICA and three of its
derivatives were used as recognition molecules, the DNA nucleoside
base molecule identification accuracy was required.9 The average discrimination accuracy for the base molecules
ranged from 40.1% ± 35.3% to 73.5% ± 16.2%. Among the four
recognition molecules, ICA gave the third most accurate identification.
When a recognition molecule having a pyrene structure that interacted
with DNA nucleosides and formed π–π interactions
was used, higher discrimination accuracy was obtained than with four
recognition molecules. Furthermore, the identification accuracy for
DNA and RNA nucleosides was required using ICA as a recognition molecule.10 The average discrimination accuracy for RNA
nucleosides was 20% higher than that for DNA nucleosides. This difference
correlated with the number of hydrogen bonds.

A combination
of bare nanogap electrodes and machine learning was
applied to single-molecule discrimination of DNA nucleosides (Figure 3d).12 Four nucleoside tunneling current–time waveforms
were measured with a 0.54 nm nanogap electrode. Pulses were extracted
from each measurement data point. The four nucleoside IpT histograms showed large overlaps. A vector
obtained by dividing one waveform corresponding to a single base molecule
into 10 in the time direction was used as a feature. A WEKA (Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis) workbench18 with many classifiers was used. The classifier with the highest
discrimination accuracy, Rotation Forest,19 was selected (Figure 3e). For the two types of discrimination, the mean F-measure >0.70. The average F-measure for the
three
types of discrimination was 0.70. Using the four types of identification,
the F-measures of dAMP, dCMP, dGMP, and dTMP (DNA
nucleoside monophosphates) were 0.59, 0.91, 0.55, and 0.86, respectively.
A random pick-up gave F-measure = 0.25. Therefore,
four nucleosides were identified with high accuracy.

Single-molecule
measurement using a tunneling current involves
highly sensitive measurement of a minute current. Its high sensitivity
enables detection of nonanalyte molecules and environmental signals.
All these signals become noise; however, this cannot be avoided. That
is, noise data are inevitably included in the data obtained by measuring
the analyte. Until now, supervised machine learning has used data
obtained by measuring one DNA nucleoside as teacher data.12 The teacher data include a pulse derived from
noise. However, data derived from the analyte cannot be identified.
Therefore, a solvent containing no sample is measured. All pulses
obtained by this measurement are noise and can thus be labeled as
noise. The solution containing the analyte is then measured. Since
it is not known whether the pulse obtained by this measurement is
noise or analyte, it is an unlabeled case. A classifier was developed
to extract sample pulses from unlabeled cases using labeled cases
(Figure 3f). This is
the Positive Unlabeled Classification (PUC) method.20 DNA nucleosides were identified using the PUC method with
a 0.54 nm bare nanogap electrode.12 The
current vector was used as the feature value, and the WEKA workbench18 was used. The highest F-measure
was obtained in Rotation Forest. The F-measures for
the four nucleosides, dAMP, dCMP, dGMP, and dCMP, were 0.59, 0.91,
0.55, and 0.86, respectively.

Combining bare nanogap electrodes
and machine learning gave a distance
between nanogap electrodes that yielded a high F-measure.12 When the distance between the nanogap electrodes
was 0.54 nm, the average F-measure of the four DNA
nucleosides was 0.77. When the distance between the electrodes was
0.56, 0.58, and 0.60 nm, this changed to 0.57, 0.63, and 0.63. Therefore,
the 0.54 nm nanogap electrode had the highest discrimination ability.
The electronic coupling between the molecule and the electrode changes
with the distance between the electrodes. The interelectrode distance
dependency of the F-measure indicates that the waveform
corresponding to a single molecule includes information on the electronic
coupling between the molecule and the electrode. Physical and chemical
interpretation of features and machine learning is difficult. However,
external perturbations that change the machine learning results are
key to interpreting the features and the reason for the high accuracy.

Combination
of Nanopore Methods and Machine Learning
The ion current
change provides information on the volume of the
analyte passing through the nanopore. This is because the volume that
the analyte excludes from the nanopore corresponds to the change in
the ion current. When the thickness of the nanopore is less than that
of the analyte, this principle provides information on the volume
of the analyte, i.e., the volume of the circular slice = the cross-sectional
area × the thickness of the nanopore. If the thickness of the
nanopore is that of an atomic monolayer, the volume of the analyte
can be obtained with atomic resolution. The idea was to develop solid-state
nanopores of graphene monolayers7 and MoS2 monolayers21 to develop DNA sequencers.
Low-aspect nanopores with nanopore thickness (L)/nanopore
diameter (D) < 1 were created.

The flow
dynamics of analytes with diameters of several hundred
nanometers or more in solid-state nanopores have been analyzed by
multiphysics simulations.22,23 The analyte in the
nanopore is subjected to the forces of electrophoresis, electroosmotic
flow, and fluid resistance. Multiphysics simulation solves the equations
describing these forces. This simulation revealed that the ion current–time
waveform of the analyte provided information on the volume, structure,
and surface charge of the analyte.22,23 Many viruses
and bacteria have similar volumes. Thus, it was considered difficult
to identify viruses and bacteria with high accuracy using IpN and tdN histograms. The problem with high-accuracy identification
is extracting this information from the waveform data. One solution
is machine learning.

Combining low-aspect nanopores and machine
learning has enabled
identification of viruses and bacteria that could not be identified
with high accuracy (Figure 4a–c). Influenza A (H1N1), influenza B, and an influenza
A subtype (H3N2) were measured using a SiN nanopore with a thickness
of 50 nm and a diameter of 300 nm.14 The
differences between the three viruses lie in the proteins that they
comprise. There were no differences between the IpN histograms of the three viruses. Ten features
including IpN and tdN were extracted from the waveform (Figure 4a). Jcurr, td (=tdN), r, θ, and Jtime mainly reflect the translocation time,
that is, the surface charge and flow dynamics of the virus. Ip (=IpN), S, and Sr mainly
reflect the current change, that is, the volume of the virus, while
β reflects its structure. Machine learning was performed using
the features created by combining these features and the WEKA workbench.18 Rotation Forest19 gave the highest F-measure. The F-measures for A (H3N2) and B, A (H1N1) and A (H3N2), and A (H1N1)
and B were 0.61, 0.68, and 0.72, respectively (Figure 4b). Based on the recall given by each feature
as an index, the three influenza viruses showed different flow dynamics
(Figure 4c).

E. coli and Bacillus subtilis were measured with low-aspect
nanopores with L/D = 40/3000 nm
(Figure 4d–f).16E.
coli and Bacillus subtilis have similar
surface potentials. Moreover, although they have the same volume,
the curvatures of their structures are different. In the IpN and tdN histograms, the two bacteria could not be discriminated with high
accuracy. Multiphysics simulations suggest that the ion current–time
waveform differs for different bacterial structures. Therefore, in
addition to IpN and tdN, features including θ, reflecting
the curvature of the structure, were extracted, and 60 feature vectors
were generated (Figure 4d). Machine learning was performed using these features and WEKA
workbench18 (Figure 4e). The maximum F-measure
was precision >0.85. As with the viruses, analysis of feature values
and F-measures revealed that Ip (=IpN), A, Along, and i, reflecting
volume and structure, gave high recall. Im and td (=tdN), reflecting surface charge and flow dynamics, gave
low recall. Therefore, it is considered that high identification accuracy
was obtained by identifying the curvature of the bacterial structure.
Developing multiphysics simulation enabled the interpretation of features.

Combining solid-state nanopores and machine learning provides quantitative
guidance for designing device structures with high discrimination
abilities. The F-measure at each aspect ratio was
obtained using the same analysis method by measuring the aspect ratio
of the solid-state nanopore (Figure 4f).16 When L/D = 40/3000 nm = 0.013, the F-measure
was 0.90. As L increased, the F-measure
decreased. This is considered to be because the spatial resolution
for examining the structures of bacteria decreases as the nanopore
thickness increases. In nanopores with a large thickness, the F-measure was predicted to decrease, but the F-measure increased after L = 500 nm. Even for solid-state
nanopores with L/D = 1500/3000 nm,
the same F-measure as that of solid-state nanopores
with L/D = 0.13 was obtained.

The identification accuracy for a single molecule may be as low
as 70%. This was the accuracy obtained from one current–time
waveform. In solution, the influenza virus A subtype was identified
with an F-measure accuracy of 0.72 in one pulse.
When 10 or more pulses of influenza virus A subtype were detected,
the identification accuracy for the influenza virus A subtype was
represented by F-measure >0.90. A method for improving
the identification accuracy by using a plurality of pulses in this
way is called an assembly method. Therefore, the higher the identification
accuracy for a single molecule, the higher the accuracy of 99% can
be achieved with a low number of readings.

Outlook
Combining
single-molecule electrical measurement and machine learning
enabled high-precision identification of analytes that could not be
identified with high accuracy by conventional methods. This allowed
quantification of the recognition ability of the recognition molecule.
Additionally, this combination provided design criteria for the interelectrode
distance and L/D suitable for high-precision
identification. Combining single-molecule electrical measurement and
machine learning enabled both high-precision discrimination and quantitative
evaluation of phenomena and structures that were previously difficult
to quantitatively evaluate.

Multiphysics simulation enabled
investigation of the flow dynamics
of single viruses and bacteria. Combining single-molecule electrical
measurement and machine learning enabled physical and chemical discoveries.
Developing multiphysics simulation enabled physical and chemical interpretation
of features.

Combining single-molecule electrical measurement
and machine learning
enables quantitative evaluation of the number of molecular species.
This is because it is established that the number of pulses of a certain
molecule = the number of its molecules. Certain types of molecules
can be counted digitally. There are no restrictions on the molecular
species that machine learning can handle. Therefore, digital analytical
chemistry that determines the molecular species and number of molecules
in a solution is possible.

Digital analytical chemistry enables
early diagnosis of cancer,
virus testing before onset, and bacterial testing. Digital analytical
chemistry of chemical reactions allows comprehensive analysis of products.
Products that have been missed in previous analyses can be discovered.
Digital analytical chemistry has the potential to search for “a
needle in a haystack”.

The machine learning methods introduced
in this min-review contain
features that have been defined by analysts. This enables physical
or chemical interpretation of the results obtained from machine learning.
Despite this, the arbitrariness of the feature remains. Deep learning
eliminates the arbitrary bias that is inadvertently introduced by
the analyst because the features have been generated by an algorithm.
However, phenomenological interpretation of the results obtained is
difficult. Furthermore, when compared with the machine learning methods
introduced in this mini-review, deep learning requires anywhere from
10- to 100-fold more data points. Therefore, after a better understanding
of the results obtained from the machine learning method has been
achieved, it is appropriate to apply deep learning during the practical
application of the single-molecule measurement method.
