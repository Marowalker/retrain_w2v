Carbohydrate–protein interactions
play an important role
in many molecular recognition processes. An exquisite combination
of multiple factors favors the interaction of the receptor with one
specific type of sugar, whereas others are excluded. Stacking CH–aromatic
interactions within the binding site provide a relevant contribution
to the stabilization of the resulting sugar–protein complex.
Being experimentally difficult to detect and analyze, the key CH−π
interaction features have been very often dissected using a variety
of techniques and simple model systems. In the present work, diffusion
NMR spectroscopy has been employed to separate the components of sugar
mixtures in different solvents on the basis of their differential
ability to interact through CH−π interactions with one
particular aromatic cosolute in solution. The experimental data show
that the properties of the solvent did also influence the diffusion
behavior of the sugars present in the mixture, inhibiting or improving
their separation. Overall, the results showed that, for the considered
monosaccharide derivatives, their diffusion coefficient values and,
consequently, their apparent molecular sizes and/or shapes depend
on the balance between solute/cosolute as well as solute/solvent interactions.
Thus, in certain media and in the presence of the aromatic cosolute,
the studied saccharides that are more suited to display CH−π
interactions exhibited a lower diffusion coefficient than the noncomplexing
sugars in the mixture. However, when dissolved in another medium,
the interaction with the solvent strongly competes with that of the
aromatic cosolute.

Introduction
Many biological events
are initiated by molecular recognition processes
that are triggered by the initial interaction between an exogenous/endogenous
sugar-type ligand and membrane cell receptors.1 Although the formation of glycan/protein complexes is driven by
many factors (e.g., hydrogen bond, van der Waals forces, etc.), the
role of CH−π interactions in such a process is currently
receiving special attention because it may subtly tune the properties
of the ligand–protein complexes. Thus, substantial efforts
are being made to analyze the features that promote such interactions
between carbohydrate entities and the aromatic side chains from the
residues within the recognition site.2

Detailed X-ray crystallographic structures of sugar/protein complexes
have clearly shown the stabilizing contribution of CH−π
interactions in these systems,3 whereas
their detection in solution by NMR spectroscopy has also been achieved.4 Moreover, NMR methods have been employed to directly
detect intramolecular methyl−π interactions within a
protein.5 NMR spectroscopy has also been
essential for the detection of CH−π interactions in model
systems using simple solutions consisting of one particular monosaccharide
and one aromatic moiety in aqueous medium. Hence, the shielding of
specific sugar NMR signals in the presence of the aromatic compounds,6 as well as the detection of intermolecular nuclear
Overhauser effects between these species in solution,7 have been correlated with the formation of sugar–aromatic
complexes. The role of solvent on the formation of noncovalent CH−
aromatic interactions has been investigated, focusing on the analysis
of certain solvent parameters that were correlated with the modulation
of the observed solute−solute CH−π interactions,8 suggesting that the interplay between solute/solvent
may have a modulating effect on these interactions9

Because optimal sugar–aromatic interactions
involve a specific
spatial arrangement of CH bonds within the sugar skeleton,6,7 some sugar moieties are more prone to establish stabilizing CH−π
interactions (e.g., α/β-galactose) than others (e.g.,
α-mannose). Therefore, we hypothesized that different monosaccharides
could be discriminated taking advantage of this recognition phenomenon.
Herein, we detail our investigations to detect sugar–aromatic
complexes within a sugar mixture by using diffusion-ordered spectroscopy
(DOSY) NMR.

During the last decades, DOSY NMR has been proposed
as a versatile
tool to perform not only the virtual separation of complex mixtures
but also to explore many other interesting aspects related to solute/solute
and solute/solvent interactions associated with size and shape changes.10 In this respect, remarkable examples of applications
of DOSY have been reported, including folding/unfolding of proteins,11 identification of secondary structure elements
of nucleic acids,12 detection and identification
of reaction intermediates,13 aggregation,14 hydrogen bonding,15 exchange,16 metal sugar complexation,17 host–guest complexation,18 detection of impurities,19 assessment
of fraud in pharmaceutical formulations,20 estimation of the molecular weight of small molecules21 and large biomolecules,22 among many others.

A number of strategies have been proposed
to enhance the performance
of DOSY NMR experiments, mostly based on subtle modifications of the
medium to modify the diffusivity of the molecules. Hence, the difficult
separation of a mixture of isomers with identical molecular weight
has been accomplished by switching solvents.23 The so-called “matrix-assisted” DOSY method did allow
the discrimination between epimers by using a (chiral) co-adjuvant
that interacts specifically with only one component of the mixture
and selectively modifies its translational diffusion properties.24 The use of chromatographic adsorbents has also
been demonstrated to efficiently facilitate the separation of complex
mixtures using solid-state NMR (“NMR chromatography”).25

Herein, we provide new evidences for the
intricate interplay of
the solvent properties that influence the strength of CH−π
interactions between sugars and aromatic compounds. The use of DOSY
NMR has permitted investigating the influence of the solvent on both
the separation of the different sugars (diastereomers) in mixtures
as well as for the discrimination of those sugars that display intrinsic
propensities to form noncovalent complexes with aromatic molecules.

Results
and Discussion
A series of permethylated monosaccharides
known to be soluble in
a variety of solvents ranging from nonpolar lipophilic cyclohexane
to polar protic water were synthesized26 (Figure 1, compounds 1–5). They were considered to be suitable
model systems to investigate carbohydrate/aryl interactions, as well
as those solvent properties that might modulate the separation of
mixtures of sugar diastereomers, as has been described for regioisomers
of simple molecules.23

name abbreviations, and atom numbering used
in the present study: α-pMeGlc(1) = 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-α-d-methylglucopyranoside, β-pMeGlc(2) = 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-β-d-methylglucopyranoside, α-pMeGal(3) = 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-α-d-methylgalactopyranoside, β-pMeGal(4) = 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-β-d-methylgalactopyranoside, and α-pMeMan(5) = 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-α-d-methylmannopyranoside.

The diffusion properties of the
components of equimolar binary
mixtures of sugars 1–5, as well as
the role of the solvent properties (i.e., cyclohexane, chloroform,
and water), were first investigated.

For a proper performance
of DOSY NMR experiments, a scarce dispersion
of the signals in the NMR spectrum of mixtures is clearly an obstacle
but, in this case, the isolated signals in the studied mixtures were
sufficient to unambiguously identify the diffusion coefficient values
of each of their components. The one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectrum of a representative mixture in water is shown in Figure 2. As typically occurs
with carbohydrates, most of the signals overlap within a narrow region
of the spectrum, including in this case, the signals of the ring protons
and also the singlets of the methyl substituents. Fortunately, for
most of the analyzed mixtures, the anomeric signals and some ring
proton signals from each sugar within the mixtures were clearly distinguishable.

D2O at 298 K (ca. 25 mM, 600 MHz). Assignments of the signals
of β-pMeGlc(2) and α-pMeGal(3) are highlighted with blue (2) and red (3).

Role of the Solvent
DOSY NMR has
been already employed
to separate carbohydrate mixtures that differ by molecular weight
(oligo and polysaccharides),27 branching
pattern,28 and/or shape.29 However, to our knowledge, until now there has not been
any study on the potential of diffusion NMR to separate mixtures of
sugar diastereomers and on the possible influence of solvent properties
to achieve this aim through specific solute/solvent interactions.

In this context, we first explored whether the separation of the
components of binary mixtures of sugars 1–5 could be achieved exclusively by switching solvents with
different properties.

In Figure 3, the
DOSY spectra of the mixture α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeGal(3) in different solvents are shown. It is noticeable that
the diffusion coefficient values of the components of the mixture,
as well as the mixture separation, depend significantly on the medium
properties.

Figure 3 1H-detected two-dimensional (2D) DOSY NMR spectra of
α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeGal(3) in (a)
cyclohexane-d12 (ca. 40 mM), (b) CDCl3 (ca. 25 mM), and (c) D2O (ca. 25 mM). On top,
the 1D 1H NMR spectra of the mixtures are displayed. The
1D 1H NMR spectrum of α-pMeGlc(1) (blue)
is also shown. Dotted lines identify the diffusion coefficient of
each component (blue (1) and red (3)).

The mixture in aqueous solution
could not be separated as the components
showed the same self-diffusion coefficient DD2O(1) = DD2O(3) = 5.25 × 10–10 m2 s–1 (Figure 3c). In cyclohexane and chloroform, however,
α-pMeGlc(1) and α-pMeGal(3)
exhibited slight, although evident, differences in their respective
diffusion coefficient values (Figure 3a,b). Interestingly, although in cyclohexane, the apparent
size of α-pMeGlc(1) is smaller than that of α-pMeGal(3) (DC6D12(1) = 1 × 10–9 m2 s–1 and DC6D12(3) = 9.33 × 10–10 m2 s–1), in chloroform, the opposite occurred
and α-pMeGlc(1) had a lower self-diffusion coefficient
(DCDCl3(1) = 4.78
× 10–10 m2 s–1) than that of α-pMeGal(3) (DCDCl3(3) = 5.13 × 10–10 m2 s–1).

Figure 4 shows the
DOSY spectra of several binary mixtures of 1–5 in cyclohexane-d12. Fittingly,
most of the studied mixtures are separated and their components (diastereomers)
showed slightly although clearly distinctive diffusion coefficient
values in cyclohexane.

Figure 4 1H-detected 2D DOSY NMR spectra of selected
binary mixtures
of permethylated monosaccharides (1–5) in cyclohexane-d12 (ca. 40 mM): (a)
α-pMeGlc(1)/β-pMeGal(4), (b)
β-pMeGlc(2)/α-pMeMan(5), (c)
α-pMeGal(3)/α-pMeMan(5). The
1D 1H NMR spectra of (a) α-pMeGlc(1),
(b) β-pMeGlc(2), and (c) α-pMeMan(5) are displayed in blue.

For instance, paying attention to the α-pMeGlc(1)/β-pMeGal(4) mixture (Figure 4a) and according to the Stokes–Einstein
equation, α-pMeGlc(1) displays the apparent smallest
hydrodynamic radius (largest diffusion coefficient, DC6D12(1) = 1 ×
10–9 m2 s–1) in comparison
to that of any of the galactose derivatives (DC6D12(3) = DC6D12(4) = 9.33 ×
10–10 m2 s–1). The
α/β configuration at the anomeric position of the galactose
derivatives did not seem to have any influence (Figures 3a and 4a). The difference
between the glucose and galactose diastereomers resides at the orientation
of the methoxy group (equatorial and axial, respectively) at C4, which
in turn also affects the distribution of rotamers around the C5–C6
torsions. It has been established that this distribution is also modulated
by the solvent properties.30 Thus, we initially
reasoned that the axial orientation of O4 could be at the origin of
the apparently larger size of the galactose derivatives when compared
with the glucose analogues in cyclohexane.

The DOSY spectrum
of the β-pMeGlc(2)/α-pMeMan(5) mixture (Figure 4b) showed the same trend (DC6D12(2) = 1 × 10–9 m2 s–1 and DC6D12(5) = 9.33 × 10–10 m2 s–1, respectively),
confirming that the configuration at the anomeric position is not
critical but rather the configuration at position C2 (α-pMeMan(5) with axial O2) or C4 (β-pMeGal(4) with
axial O4) is crucial for the separation. Because the distribution
of the C5–C6 rotamers for mannose and glucose are analogous,31 we concluded that the observed separation and
associated size differences in the pMeGlc/pMeGal and pMeGlc/pMeMan
mixtures were mostly driven by the presence of axial substituents
(C2/C4) in the Gal and Man moieties. The absence of separation in
the mixtures α-pMeGal(3)/α-pMeMan(5) (Figure 4c) supported
this hypothesis (identical diffusion coefficient values DC6D12(3) = DC6D12(5)
= 9.33 × 10–10 m2 s–1). Thus, the simple presence of axial substituents at C2 or C4 strongly
modulates the diffusion properties and the apparent sizes of these
permethylated monosaccharides (1–5) in the nonpolar cyclohexane.

As the next step, the DOSY NMR
spectra of selected mixtures of 1–5 in aqueous solution were also analyzed.
The results obtained for the mixtures in water were initially confusing
because none of them could be separated by DOSY NMR and all of them
exhibited the same diffusion coefficient value (DD2O(1–5) =
5.25 × 10–10 m2 s–1). We thus concluded that in contrast to the interactions in the
cyclohexane solutions, intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the aqueous
mixtures, with water acting as either hydrogen bond donor or acceptor
and compounds 1–5 as hydrogen bond
acceptors, could make the hydrodynamic radius of the sugars rather
similar, consequently yielding almost identical diffusion coefficients.

Thus, it appears that the separation of these sugar diastereomers
by diffusion NMR depends on the properties of both, the solute and
solvent. Hence, the apparent size of these sugars, as deduced by their
corresponding coefficient diffusion values, is tuned by a complex
balance between the sugar/solvent and solvent/solvent interactions.

Three’s Company: Two Sugars and One Aromatic Cosolute
The previous results encouraged us to investigate whether the diffusion
coefficient of the sugars, either in cyclohexane or in water, could
also be altered by their specific interaction with an aromatic compound
present in solution. The corroboration of this hypothesis could be
taken as a novel although indirect proof of the formation of carbohydrate/aromatic
complexes via CH–aromatic interactions.

First, the chemical
shift perturbations (CSPs) of the NMR signals of the sugars upon addition
of benzene to the mixtures in cyclohexane were detected. Interestingly,
CSPs were noticeable for not only signals from those CH−π
anticipated for the ring protons6 but also
for methyl groups, suggesting the existence of CH3–π
interactions (Figure 5).5,7

Figure 5 Expansion of the region of the 1D 1H spectra

and methyl protons of the mixture of α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeMan(5) (ca. 40 mM) in cyclohexane-d12 in absence (a) and presence of a 10 times
concentration of benzene (b). The original shift of the methyl signals
are highlighted (in blue (1) and red (5)).

Next, the DOSY spectra of selected
cyclohexane mixtures upon addition
of benzene were acquired. Two representative results are presented
in Figure 6. In general,
the separation of most of the mixtures followed the same pattern as
that in the absence of the aromatic molecules. The interval differences
for the diffusion coefficients are, in general, only slightly larger,
although noticeable in the presence of benzene, as exemplified in
the DOSY spectrum recorded for the α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeGal(3)/benzene mixture in cyclohexane (Figure 6a). In contrast, the separation observed
for the α-pMeGal(3)/α-pMeMan(5) mixture in the presence of benzene was remarkable (Figure 6b, DC6D12(3) = 9.29 × 10–10 m2 s–1 and DC6D12(5)
= 10 × 10–10 m2 s–1, respectively). Strikingly, these two sugars could not be separated
in plain cyclohexane (Figure 4c). Besides the observed CH3–π interactions
detected as CSP, the spatial arrangement of the CH groups of the α-pMeGal(3) derivative fulfills the geometric requirements for establishing
optimal multivalent CH−π interactions with aromatic rings
(when compared with α-pMeMan(5)). The putative
stacking interactions of this molecule with benzene may satisfactorily
explain the apparent larger size of the α-pMeGal(3) derivative in the presence of benzene when compared to that of
the α-pMeMan(5) analogue. Thus, for these systems
in cyclohexane, the DOSY results provide an indirect proof of the
existence of stabilizing CH−π and Me−π interactions
between α-pMeGal(3) and benzene.

Figure 6 1H 2D DOSY
spectra of the binary mixtures (a) α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeGal(3) and (b) α-pMeGal(3)/α-pMeMan(5) in cyclohexane-d12 upon addition
of benzene (ca. 40 mM). One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra
of one of the components of the mixture are
displayed in blue [(a) α-pMeGlc(1) and (b) α-pMeGal(3)].

Subsequently, the effect
of the presence of an aromatic cosolute
in aqueous mixtures was investigated. In contrast with the cyclohexane
mixtures, major signal shifts were observed for the CH-ring resonances
when compared to those for the O-methyl groups. The analysis of the
DOSY spectra of the corresponding aqueous mixtures upon addition of
phenol was, however, much less straightforward than the interpretation
of the cyclohexane mixtures. In general, no clear separation was achieved
in the presence of phenol (Figure 7b, DD2O(3) = DD2O(5) = 4.91 × 10–10 m2 s–1) and only for the α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeGal(3)/phenol mixture, a well-defined separation of the diffusion
coefficients of the sugars was observed (Figure 7a, DD2O(1) = 5.02 × 10–10 m2 s–1 and DD2O(3) = 4.93 × 10–10 m2 s–1). In this case, the apparent hydrodynamic
radius of α-pMeGal(3) increased compared to that
of α-pMeGlc(1) when phenol was present in solution.
The smaller diffusion coefficient observed for α-pMeGal(3) may be correlated with the tendency of α-pMeGal(3) to display multivalent CH−π interactions through
the CH groups at positions 3, 4, and 5. However, the possible interplay
of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between both solutes and the solvent
hamper the analysis of the observed data.

Figure 7 1H 2D DOSY
spectra of the binary aqueous mixtures (a)
α-pMeGlc(1)/α-pMeGal(3) and
(b) α-pMeGal(3)/α-pMeMan(5)
(ca. 25 mM) upon addition of phenol. One-dimensional 1H
spectra of one of the components of the mixture are displayed in blue
[(a) (1) and (b) (3)].

Therefore, although the data obtained for the cyclohexane
mixtures
allowed for a clear-cut discrimination of the components (separation
by DOSY), the lack of separation for most of the investigated mixtures
in water clearly suggests that the solvent properties strongly influence
the type and strength of interactions between the species in solution.
The intrinsic chemical nature of each sugar diastereomer in every
specific mixture (solute/solvent interactions), as well as the balance
between the intermolecular interactions (i.e., hydrogen bonds and
CH−π interactions), modulates the recognition process.
Thus, for the CH−π contacts, solvophobic effects drive
the interactions between the nonpolar groups.32

Conclusions
We have used diffusion NMR spectroscopy
to screen the possibility
of separation of the components of sugar binary mixtures in different
solvents. The mixtures were composed by simple permethylated monosaccharide
diastereomers. The working hypothesis relied on the existence of characteristic
solvation/diffusion properties of each sugar that could be modulated
by solute/solvent interactions and by the presence of aromatic rings
(cosolute). Our results suggest that tiny configurational differences
of the solutes (even at only one stereogenic center) drastically modify
their interaction with the solvent, yielding different diffusion coefficients
for the sugars in solution. Despite their obvious similarities (i.e.,
identical molecular weight and chemical functionalities), in nonpolar
nonprotic cyclohexane, the glucose derivatives showed the smallest
size and higher diffusion coefficient values compared to that of their
counterparts in the mixture (galactose or mannose derivatives). Although
self-diffusion coefficient values are very similar, noticeable differences
were observed for the components of some of the studied mixtures.
Intriguingly, the same mixtures in water (polar, protic solvent) could
not be separated by DOSY, suggesting that their shapes and sizes (i.e.,
hydrodynamic radius of the sugars) become almost identical (similar
diffusion coefficient) as a consequence of the interaction with the
solvent (i.e., hydrogen bond). Further experiments with specific mixtures
confirmed the influence of the solvent properties to properly achieve
the challenging separation by diffusion NMR.

In addition, we
have probed for the first time that sugar–aromatic
interactions (CH−π interactions) may modify the apparent
size of monosaccharide derivatives and consequently their diffusion
coefficients. This fact allows for the discrimination of the components
of binary mixtures as a function of their respective ability to interact
with aromatic compounds in solution. Moreover, we have shown the strong
influence of the solvent properties to allow the detection of the
CH−π interactions. The competition with other types of
noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, may definitively
influence the attainable size and shape differences.

Overall,
the presented results open up the possibility of using
DOSY as an additional experimental tool to demonstrate and support
the existence of intermolecular CH−π interactions during
formation of specific complexes.

Methods
NMR Samples
All permethylated monosaccharides were
synthesized according to the literature description.26 All compounds used for the synthesis, as well as phenol,
benzene, and deuterated solvents (i.e., D2O, CDCl3, and cyclohexane-d12), were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

The 600 μL NMR samples (5 mm NMR tubes)
of the binary mixtures were prepared at a concentration of ca. 20–40
mM for each sugar.

Stock solutions of aromatic compounds (i.e.,
phenol in D2O and benzene in cyclohexane-d12) were
prepared to add small volumes to the NMR samples to reach the desired
sugar–aryl ratio concentrations.

The 1H chemical
shift scales are internally referred
to trimethylsilylpropionate (D2O), tetramethylsilane (CDCl3), and to the nondeuterated solvent signal (δ 1.38 ppm)
for cyclohexane-d12 solutions. The 13C chemical shift scales are referred to acetone (δ
30.9 ppm) in D2O and to the residual signal of chloroform
(δ 77.4 ppm) and cyclohexane (δ 26.4 ppm).

NMR Experiments
All experiments were performed at room
temperature (298 K) either on a Bruker Avance (500 MHz) or on a Bruker
Avance II (600 MHz) spectrometer, equipped with a triple resonance
high-resolution probe (TXI). The characterization of the compounds
in different solvents was achieved by NMR standard experiments. NMR
experimental data and assignment of 1–5 in different solvents are available in the Supporting Information and at NMRshiftDB33 under
the corresponding molecules identification codes (i.e., 60004073 (1), 60004029 (2), 60004074 (3),
60004071 (4), and 60004072 (5)). The attribution
of scalar couplings was supported by 1H NMR spectra simulation
with SpinWorks 4.0.3 (K. Marat, University of Manitoba, 2014) using
NUMRIT algorithms.34

For the measurement
of diffusion coefficients of the components of the mixtures, data
acquisition and analysis were carried out using Bruker Topspin software
(Bruker BioSpin, Germany). The DOSY experiments were performed using
the longitudinal eddy current delay bipolar gradient pulse sequence
(ledbpgp2s) from Bruker library. The diffusion delay Δ was set
at 150–200 ms, the gradient strength g (2
ms) was linearly incremented in 32–64 steps from 2 to 95% of
its maximum value, longitudinal eddy currents delay of 5 ms and 8/16
scans were recorded for each experiment. Processing was achieved using
4 K points in the F2 dimension and 256 points in F1. An exponential
window function with 3 Hz line broadening was applied in the F2 dimension
prior to Fourier transformation. After baseline correction, the diffusion
dimension was processed with the DOSY processing program (Bruker TopSpin
software 3.5). A logarithmic scaling was applied to the diffusion
axis, and a noise sensitivity factor of 4 and line width factor of
1 were used. The fitting of the diffusion dimension in the 2D DOSY
spectra was obtained using a single exponential fit.
