Iron-based metal–organic frameworks
(Fe-MOFs) have emerged
as promising candidates for drug delivery applications due to their
low toxicity, structural flexibility, and safe biodegradation in a
physiological environment. Here, we studied two types of Fe-MOFs:
MIL-53 and MIL-88B, for in vitro drug loading and releasing of ibuprofen
as a model drug. Both Fe-MOFs are based on the same iron clusters
and organic ligands but form different crystal structures as a result
of two different nucleation pathways. The MIL-53 structure demonstrates
one-dimensional channels, while MIL-88B exhibits a three-dimensional
cage structure. Our studies show that MIL-53 adsorbs more ibuprofen
(37.0 wt %) compared to MIL-88B (19.5 wt %). A controlled drug release
was observed in both materials with a slower elution pattern in the
case of the ibuprofen-encapsulated MIL-88B. This indicates that a
complex cage structure of MIL-88 is beneficial to control the rate
of drug release. A linear correlation was found between cumulative
drug release and the degree of material degradation, suggesting the
biodegradation of Fe-MILs as the main drug elution mechanism. The
cytotoxicity of MIL-88B was evaluated in vitro with NIH-3T3 Swiss
mouse fibroblasts, and it shows that MIL-88B has no adverse effects
on cell viability up to 0.1 mg/mL. This low toxicity was attributed
to the morphology of MIL-88B nanocrystals. The very low toxicity and
controlled drug release behavior of Fe-MIL-88B suggest that better
materials for drug-delivery applications can be created by controlling
not only the composition but also the crystal structure and nanoparticle
morphology of the material.

1 Introduction
The
rapid growth of drug discovery and the increasing demand for
drug-eluting medical implants accelerate the search for new drug carrier
systems with low toxicity, better control of drug loading capacity,
and sustainable drug releasing. So far, polymeric and inorganic complexes
have been widely applied for the drug delivery and controllable release
of pharmaceutical compounds. In particular, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polymers and their polymeric particles have
been used in a variety of therapeutic devices due to their excellent
biocompatibility.1−3 The inorganic solids, such as porous silicon, functionalized
silica, and zeolites, are also utilized as drug carriers.4−6 Some of these organic and inorganic materials have limited drug
loading capacity and complex interactions of loaded drugs at the guest–host
interface. As an alternative, a type of hybrid materials, metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), combining the advantages of polymers and inorganic
mesoporous solids, have emerged as drug delivery matrices.7−11

MOFs are solid porous crystals composing of metal ions or
clusters
as secondary building blocks (SBUs) cross-linked by organic ligands.12,13 Due to the high porosity, large surface area, and suitable pore
sizes, MOFs have exhibited potential in many applications, such as
gas separation and storage, catalysis, and loading other guest molecules.14−18 More recently, increasing interest has been attracted to apply MOFs
for biomedical applications, such as imaging, sensing, and loading
therapeutic agents as delivery vehicles.19−21 Compared to
other traditional drug carriers (i.e., polymers, nanoparticles, bacteria,
etc.), MOFs exhibit an excellent drug loading capacity and controlled
release profile of many therapeutic agents, attributed to their porous
structures.19,22 In addition, MOFs can be engineered
for specific drug delivery due to the flexibility and versatile chemical
composition of the framework. For example, a rigid MOF, MIL-100 (MIL
stands for Material Institut Lavoisier), is able to hold up to 21.2
wt % azidothymidine triphosphate (AZT-TP, an antiretroviral drug for
HIV/AIDS treatment), while its loading capacity can be increased to
42.0 wt % when amino-functionalized MIL-100 is used.9 In comparison, traditional drug carriers have a much lower
loading capacity (i.e., polymer nanoparticles, ∼6 wt %; liposomal
systems, <1 wt %).23,24 Despite the MOFs advantage of
high drug loading and effective delivery, an ongoing issue of its
safety and biocompatibility is questioned. In the last five years,
many studies have been conducted to test cytotoxicity of MOFs with
various cell and animal models.25,26 One type of MOF, iron-containing
MOFs (Fe-MOFs), has truly stood out for their supreme safety and biodegradability.11,22,27 A majority of Fe-MOFs belong
to the MIL and BioMOF families, including MIL-53, MIL-88, MIL-100,
MIL-101, BioMOF-1, and BioMOF-5.10,19,28−31 Selection of a drug delivery system is based on drug
formulation, delivery routes, targeting organs/cells, etc. Therefore,
it is crucial to select the correct MOF for a particular drug and
for a specific target. So far, little research has been done to optimize
MOF structures for a certain delivery route. In addition, other factors
should also be considered, such as the guest–host interaction,
pore size, cavity volume, and stability, especially when a MOF is
paired with a therapeutic agent. Most MOFs contain hydrophobic properties
due to their organic ligands, making them efficient in adsorbing hydrocolloids
and lipophilic drugs. However, most MOFs lack stability in aqueous
conditions due to their relatively weak coordination bonding between
metal clusters and ligands. The degradation of MOFs in aqueous solutions
can be viewed as an advantage when considering a potential biodegradable
drug delivery system. Structural decomposition provides an easy method
for releasing encapsulated drug molecules; however, the kinetics of
decomposition and retention of MOF structure in a biological environment
is not well understood. Additionally, when designing MOFs for drug
delivery, it is important to take into consideration their wettability
and stability.

In this study, we focused on using unstable Fe-MOFs
as biodegradable
drug delivery systems. This work aims at studying two aspects of Fe-MOFs:
(A) the effect of crystal structure on drug loading/adsorption and
(B) the interactions between the guest molecules and host matrix (drug
and MOFs), including drug elution kinetics and material degradation.

Fe-based MIL-53 and MIL-88B are two flexible Fe-MOFs consisting
of iron ligands connected by terephthalate (TA) linkers. It has been
found that MIL-53 forms through a homogenous nucleation and MIL-88B
through a heterogeneous nucleation.32 MIL-53
consists of oxygen-centered iron-carboxylate trimers (octahedral shaped
FeO6) connected by TA linkers forming rhomb-shaped 1D channels.33 Composing of the same FeO6 clusters
and TA ligands, MIL-88B exhibits a hexagonal 3D structure.30 Here, we show that differences in crystal structure
results in various characteristics in drug (ibuprofen) loading and
delivery. Ibuprofen was selected as the model drug in this study due
to its structural simplicity and size. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD),
infrared spectroscopic studies, and nitrogen sorption isotherms have
been performed to determine the drug adsorption and interface interactions
within the carriers’ systems. Various kinetic models were used
to evaluate the drug release profiles of MIL-53 and MIL-88B. The biocompatibility
was tested in vitro with NIH-3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblasts. We believe
that the joint effort of MIL synthesis coupled with cell model studies
will provide a deep and systematic understanding of these two Fe-based
MIL materials as drug delivery systems. Additionally, we focused on
the role of the crystal structure toward drug delivery by illustrating
three drug elution models that can be applied to other MOFs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Materials
and Drug Loading
Studies
MIL-88B and MIL-53 contain the same ligands, but
their formation is guided by different nucleation processes that can
be controlled by different synthetic conditions. The crystal structures
of MIL-88B and MIL-53 before and after loading with ibuprofen were
studied using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). As shown in Figure 1a, the PXRD patterns
of MIL-88B are in good agreement with previous studies.39,40 MIL-88B exhibited three characteristic diffraction peaks at 9.14°,
10.60°, and 11.48° representing the 002, 100, and 101 phases,
respectively.10 We noticed that the diffraction
feature was shifted from 10.62° for as-synthesis MIL-88B to 11.48°
for the same bulk crystal after solvent exchange followed by further
thermal activation. A diffraction angle shifting to a larger angle
indicates the shrinkage of the crystal cell based on the Bragg’s
Law,41 This increase in the angle confirms
the decreased cage volume of MIL-88B once the trapped DMF solvent
inside crystals was replaced and removed. Moreover, after loading
with ibuprofen, the MIL-88B pore volume was expanded reflected by
the decrease in diffraction angle for the same 101 peak. Our results
confirmed the structural flexibility of both MIL-53 and MIL-88B as
the “breathing effect” enables both materials to trap
guest molecules with shrinkable frameworks, which is consistent with
previous literature.28,42−44Figure 1b shows the PXRD patterns for
MIL-53 as synthesized, after solvent exchange, and loaded with ibuprofen.
The diffraction angle at 9.1° is a significant feature for MIL-53.45,46 After loading with ibuprofen, both MIL-53 and MIL-88B exhibited
crystal structures from both host and guest materials. Extra PXRD
features at 16.6° and 19.4° were observed on both MILs after
loading with ibuprofen, indicating that ibuprofen was added to both
porous solids.47 It is critically important
to determine the location of guest drug molecules relative to the
host material; therefore, we further performed gas sorption studies
to study the porosity changes corresponding to drug loading in the
next part. The chemical compositions of both MILs are identical as
confirmed by our attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) studies,
shown in Figure 2.
Both MILs exhibited a Fe–O stretch at 549 cm–1, a carboxylate —C=O stretch at 1602 cm–1, a and −C–O stretch at 1389 cm–1, which are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.25,28,48 After the structural studies,
we optimized drug loading conditions for each material. Considering
the polarity of ibuprofen and stability of MILs in organic solvents,
we immersed MILs into ibuprofen/hexane solutions with various concentrations
for different amounts of time. We found that the best drug loading
condition for MIL-88B was 10 mg/mL with a soaking time of 24 h, while
for MIL-53, the condition is 30 mg/mL for 72 h with a nanoparticle-to-drug
ratio of 1:3. After loading ibuprofen in hexane, the crystal structures
of both MIL-88B and MIL-53 were still present (Figure 1), indicating that both materials did not
degrade during drug loading procedures. Additionally, ATR-IR studies
confirmed that the ibuprofen has been successfully incorporated into
both materials, indicated by an increasing intensity of the —C=O
stretch by comparison with pure ibuprofen shown in Figure 1b. By analyzing IR and PXRD
studies of MIL-88B, we concluded that ibuprofen was successfully incorporated
in MIL-88B. However, at this point, we were unclear about whether
ibuprofen was adsorbed on the outer surface or encapsulated inside
of MIL-53 crystals. Therefore, we applied N2 gas sorption
analysis to monitor the changes in the surface area and available
pore sizes of both Fe-MILs after ibuprofen treatments, Figure 3. The specific surface area
(SSA) was calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) theory49 with N2 sorption
isotherms at 77 K (details are available in the Supporting Information). We noticed that the SSA of MIL-53
decreased from 30.1 to 22.1 m2/g after loading with ibuprofen,
indicating that ibuprofen was encapsulated inside of MIL-53 and occupied
available channels. A similar trend was also observed for MIL-88B
by comparing SSA before and after ibuprofen loading. Table S1 summarizes the surface area changes of both MILs
corresponding to drug loading. We also examined the external surface
area of both MILs before and after loading with ibuprofen. The t-plot studies50 using Micromeritics
software show that the external surface area of ibu-MIL-88B decreased
to 21.7 cm2/g compared to that of pristine MIL-88 of 27.9
cm2/g. The micropore surface area of MIL-88B decreases
from 14.4 to 3.9 cm2/g after loading with ibuprofen, confirming
that majority internal cages were filled with ibuprofen. A similar
trend was also noticed on the MIL-53 system with a decrease in the
external surface area. To eliminate solvent molecules that may interfere
with our results, all testing samples were thermally activated in
a vacuum oven at 65 °C for over 72 h. Based on their unique crystal
structures, the maximum accessible surface areas (theoretical SSA)
for MIL-53 and MIL-88B are 2203 m2/g (H2 as
a probe) and 3042 m2/g (N2 as a probe), respectively.28,51,52 Although the surface areas obtained
experimentally are typically smaller than those predicted based on
single-crystal structures, this is due to some solvent molecules still
remain and a small fraction of framework bonds break, thus block channels
during degassing. Furthermore, a strong surface tension can be formed between the
adsorbent and adsorbate during the removal of the solvent in vacuum,
which may further promote the collapse of channels. The structural
loss of porosity affects more for porous crystals with 1D channels,
such as MIL-53. Another explanation is attributed to the structural
flexibility of iron-based MILs. Unlike their Cr or Al analogues, the
channels remain closed for Fe-MIL-53 after the solvent or guest molecule
is removed, thus unable nitrogen molecules to enter.53−55Scheme S1 illustrates the flexibility
of MIL-53 frameworks. Relatively small SSA was also reported for MIL-53
in other studies.10,28,56 Combining results from PXRD, ATR-IR, and N2 sorption
analyses, we concluded that ibuprofen was successfully encapsulated
in MIL-88B and MIL-53.

plots.

The driving force for ibuprofen
loading is the strong hydrogen-bonding
and weak van der Waals interactions between ibuprofen and the hydroxyl
groups from the matrix.10 We also tried
a one-pot synthesis method57 to mix therapeutic
agents together with MOF starting materials in a solvothermal setting;
however, no desired MIL crystals were formed. We suspect that the
carboxylate groups in ibuprofen may compete with terephthalic acid
for coordinating with FeO3 clusters, thus disturbed the
formation of MIL-88B and MIL-53. Therefore, we continued with the
immersion method for drug loading in this study. To quantify the drug
loading capacity of MIL materials, we applied a UV–vis spectrometer
to monitor the concentration of ibuprofen at 264 nm (λmax), before and after incorporation into MIL materials. The detailed
UV spectra were provided in the Supporting Information. Based on eq 1, the
calculated ibuprofen loading amounts approximates 372.2 mg/g of MIL-53
and 194.6 mg/g of MIL-88B, respectively. The drug loading capacities
are consistent with previously reported values.9,10 Although
these values are not as large as the values reported for other MOFs,
for example, MIL-101 and MIL-100
(containing much larger volumes because of their rigid structures),
both MIL-53 and MIL-88B are significantly better than other porous
materials for drug delivery (usually less than 50 mg of drug per gram
of the host material, of 5 wt %).24,58 In our studies,
MIL-53 was able to be incorporated about 17% more ibuprofen compared
to MIL-88B. We suspected that the higher drug loading capacity observed
for MIL-53 is mainly due to the monoclinic symmetry of its structure,
facilitating the diffusion of guest molecules. The crystal structures
and drug loading capacity for each MIL have been summarized in Table 1. Although Fe-MIL-88B
contains a larger pore volume than MIL-53, the drug loading capacity
is lower than for MIL-53. We presume that the 1D channel of MIL-53
may account for a faster mass transfer of guest molecules compared
to the cage-like structure of MIL-88B crystals.

Additionally,
we studied the changes in morphology of MIL-88B crystals
corresponding to drug loading in hexane. Figure 4 presents the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of MIL-88B before and after loading of ibuprofen. MIL-88B
exhibited a rice-grain shape with a length of around 500 nm along
the c-axis. Larger crystals with a dimension of 2
μm were observed in the same synthesis solution that may attribute
to an over-grown crystallization process. After being treated with
ibuprofen in hexane, MIL-88B showed no obvious change in morphology,
although the population of large crystals has increased. This may
indicate a continuous crystal growth of MIL-88B during the drug loading
process, which may cause ibuprofen molecules encapsulated not only
within the pores but also trapped inside the particles.

loading.

2.2 Drug
Elution Studies
After confirming
ibuprofen was successfully loaded into both Fe-MILs, we studied the
drug elution process of each material. We stirred ibuprofen-loaded
MIL-53 and MIL-88B in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), respectively,
to mimic drug releasing in a physiologic environment. Solutions were
collected in periodic intervals up to 10 days for monitoring ibuprofen
elution and degradation of MILs and analyzed using a reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Figure 5 displays the cumulative ibuprofen released
from treated MIL-53 and MIL-88B as a function of an immersing time.
We noticed that the concentration of ibuprofen increased with increasing
soaking times for both Fe-MILs, indicating that ibuprofen was released
from both materials over time. However, a drug releasing burst was
observed for both MILs within the first 24 h, indicating a faster
drug elution process, likely due to surface adsorbed species. The
drug release profile can be illustrated by two stages: the first stage
refers to a fast drug release; the second stage can be treated as
a stable phase as the drug concentration increased slightly with respect
to the increasing contact time with PBS. A similar two-stage drug
release profile was observed previously on Cr-based MIL-53.10 During our testing period, the accumulative
drug releasing amounts were 27.4 and 18.0% for MIL-53 and MIL-88B,
respectively. The low drug elution amounts after 10 days indicates
that there was still a large amount of ibuprofen that had not been
released from the host materials. We think that the low drug releasing
amount was due to the slow degradation of Fe-MILs in aqueous. A similar
drug elution result was reported by Horcajada et al., showing that
Fe-MIL-88B can last up to 21 days in a simulated body fluid.10 In our study, we noticed that MIL powder was
still visible in the testing solution even after 1 month. A slow releasing
rate of ibuprofen by MILs after the first two days was similar to
the releasing profile of MIL-88B when caffeine was used as the model
drug.60 The slow drug releasing rate is
beneficial for drug delivery applications that require drug elution
in a controlled manner. Additionally, it is critically important to
understand the drug release mechanisms to better adopt MIL materials
for drug delivery applications. Therefore, we applied several mathematical
models to interpret the drug elution behaviors with consideration
of the biodegradable nature of both MILs. Scheme 1 summarizes the drug delivery systems and
their fitting models in this work.

The data were fitted with the Hill equation as indicated by the red
plots.

Scheme 1 Illustrative Scheme of Drug Delivery
Systems and Models Considered
for MIL-88B and MIL-53
The zero-order (eq 2) kinetics is based on Fick’s law of diffusion and has been
widely used to describe release kinetics for diffusion-controlled
reservoir systems, such as nanoparticles and membrane-encapsulated
vesicles.61 Studies show that ibuprofen
released by Cr- and Fe-based MIL-53 has followed this model for at
least one stage.10 Considering the biodegradation
of both MILs, a first-order kinetic model (eq 3) was used to analyze the drug delivery behaviors.
The first-order kinetic equation is based on hydrolysis decomposition
behaviors.35 Moreover, the degradation/erosion
of a drug delivery system can be distinguished into two models: surface
erosion and bulk erosion. Surface erosion refers to the degradation
process, which is mainly restricted to the outermost surface of these
porous crystals without harm to the interior. The surface erosion
model can be described using the Peppas equation (eq 4).36,62 The bulk erosion
model describes a drug delivery system decomposing into smaller fragments
due to material cleavage in physiological environment and can be described
by the Hixson–Crowell model (eq 5).23,37 The Hill model (eq 6) takes into consideration of the
limited diffusion and erosion of the matrices.38 Drug release kinetics is the combined results of drug molecular
movement (mass transfer) and host material’s behaviors, such
as swelling, degradation, and interactions with guest molecules.61 Based on the crystal structure and stability
of MILs, the higher correlation coefficients were observed in the
Hill model for both drug delivery systems, shown in Figure 5, indicating that the ibuprofen
release kinetics fits better for a combined model of diffusion, surface,
and bulk erosion. The monoclinic structure of MIL-53 is expected to
promote the mass transfer of ibuprofen to be released. In comparison,
MIL-88B has complex 3D pores, which may reduce the drug releasing
rate. Such a controlled drug release profile of MIL-88B is favorable
for a desired slow drug delivery process.

Another factor that
should be considered is the stability of MILs
in aqueous conditions. Most Fe-based MILs are not stable in aqueous
environment due to interruption in coordination bonds induced by water
molecules. To evaluate the stabilities of MIL-53 and MIL-88B, we monitored
the concentration change of the building ligand (terephthalate) for
both MILs using HPLC, shown in Figure 6a. We noticed an increase in the concentration of terephthalate
ligands with a longer immersion time in PBS with a similar kinetic
profile as the ibuprofen elution process. With the breakdown of frameworks
of each MIL, preloaded guest molecules are able to freely diffuse
into the surrounding solution. This degradation of MILs can explain
the increasing concentrations of ibuprofen even after 10 days. The
degradation process also leads to the increase in concentrations of
Fe3+, which was monitored using ICP-AES. This increasing
amount of iron is another evidence of MIL decomposition in PBS as
a function of time. By performing a linear regression analysis to
evaluate the relationship between drug release and material degradation,
a linear relationship was observed for both systems (Figure 6b), indicating that material
degradation has caused the drug elution. We believe that the drug
releasing process is a combination of ibuprofen desorption/diffusion
and, more importantly, MIL material degradation. Based on the releasing
profiles, we believe that the degradation of carrier matrices is the
dominant factor on drug releasing.

regression correlation between TA concentration change and cumulative
drug release percents of both MIL-53 (blue solid squares) and MIL-88B
(black solid circles).

2.3 Cytotoxicity
Studies
The chemical
composition of MIL-88B (iron and terephthalate) was one of the factors
why MIL-88B was selected as a carrier for drug delivery applications.
The toxicity of Fe-based MOFs is low when compared to Zr-based MOFs
that exhibit better stability in aqueous conditions. In addition,
Fe-based MOF nanoparticles are also classified as safe for the delivery
of contrast agents.25 We have tested the
cytotoxicity of MIL-88B nanoparticles because its monotonic release
profile of ibuprofen (Figure 5) seems more suitable for drug delivery applications than
MIL-53.

We evaluated the cytotoxicity of the MIL-88B with the
NIH-3T3 Swiss mouse fibroblast cells by adding the particles to the
media (after sterilization). After 48 h incubation, the CellTiter96
viability assay (Figure 7) shows that the particles have no adverse effect on cell viability
up to 0.1 mg/mL. After the addition of 0.25 mg/mL, the viability decreases
to about 60% and then drops to about 40% after increasing the concentration
to 2 mg/mL. The cell viability did not drop below 40% for the maximum
tested concentration of 2.5 mg/mL.

Figure 7 Effect of MIL-88B on viability of NIH-3T3
Swiss mouse fibroblasts.
The error bar represents a standard deviation from 18 independent
measurements.

The cellular uptake of nanoparticles
strongly depends on their
size and surface groups and, in this case, also the MOF composition.
Both metal ion and organic ligand can contribute to toxicity. In Figure 4, the size and shape
of the studied MIL-88B show that the majority of the material is formed
as approximately 500 nm (along the c-axis) rice-grain
shaped particles. Thus, the nanoparticles are significantly larger
than previously tested MIL-88B by Tamames-Tabar et al.25 where the average size of nanoparticle was 100
± 20 nm. The reported toxicity at 50% was 1.26 mg/mL recorded
in HeLa cells and 0.37 mg/mL recorded in J774 cells. The differences
were attributed to the different phagocytic pathways in tested cell
lines since J774 is a macrophage cell line prone to increased phagocytosis.
In the case of our studies, the toxicity of the MIL-88B measured with
3T3 cells is lower than in both previously studied cell lines. Both
HeLa and 3T3 cells are not macrophages, so the difference in toxicity
is most likely related to the larger particle size in our studies.
At this point, we cannot conclude with certainty what is the main
mechanism of lower toxicity of MIL-88 in our study compered to Tamames-Tabar
et al.,25 but we can identify two sources
of this behavior. Either the large size of the nanoparticles decreases
the cellular uptake or the larger size of nanoparticles slows down
the decomposition of individual nanoparticles within the cell and,
thus, lowers the toxicity of the tested material.

3 Conclusions
In all, two types of Fe-MOFs, MIL-88B and MIL-53,
were evaluated
for drug loading and elution with ibuprofen as a model drug. We concluded
that the monoclinic crystal structure of MIL-53 promotes a high drug
loading capacity due to a favorable mass transfer within the 1D channels,
but the same structure also exhibits a faster and higher drug release
profile. MIL-88B with a 3D cage structure offers more flexibility
and better control over drug elution behavior. These structural differences
between Fe-MOFs that are formed with identical SBUs and ligands strongly
suggest that directing crystal structure can tune drug elution behavior.
In addition, we show that the MIL-88B in the form of large nanoparticles
is biodegradable and noncytotoxic. We believe that the ability to
direct structures of Fe-MOFs together with its high biocompatibility
will allow in the future to create the “designer” structures
for the delivery of particular drug with desired release profile.

4.2 Synthesis of MIL-53
Fe-MIL-53 was
synthesized according to the literature.10 TA (0.7 mmol) and FeCl3·6H2O (0.7 mmol)
were dissolved in 15 mL of DMF in a glass reactor. To obtain a sufficient
material, six reactors were prepared together. The mixed solution
was placed in a preheated oven at 150 °C for 15 h to form Fe-MIL-53
crystals. After cooling to room temperature, the crystals were separated
by vacuum filtration and rinsed with DMF, acetone, and deionized water.
After that, the crystals were vacuum dried at room temperature and
followed by drying in a gravity oven at 110 °C to remove extra
moisture. These crystals were named as-synthesized MIL-53 and were
performed PXRD analysis. Solvent exchange for trapped DMF for water
by stirring as-synthesized MIL-53 in deionized water for 24 h. The
MIL-53 colloid was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm (Eppendorf, Centrifuge
5430). For the removal of water and free up porous space for drug
loading, MIL-53 crystals were further dried in a vacuum oven (Fisher
Scientific, Isotemp vacuum oven model 281A) at 65 °C for 24 h.

4.3 Synthesis of MIL-88B
Fe-MIL-88B crystals
were synthesized via a revised solvothermal method according to a
previous reported procedure.9 FeCl3·6H2O (1 mmol) and TA (1 mmol) were dispersed
in 5 mL of DMF with 0.4 mL of sodium hydroxide (2.0 N) in a glass
reactor. The mixed solution was sonicated for 3 min before being placed
in a preheated oven at 100 °C for 12 h. After the solvothermal
synthesis, the orange solid, Fe-MIL-88B, was recovered by filtration
and washed with DMF, deionized water, and acetone. The product was
then placed in a gravity oven at 110 °C for 24 h to completely
dry as-synthesized Fe-MIL-88B.

To make sure the MIL-88B structure
was clear from DMF and unreacted ligands, additional solvent exchange
procedures were performed: MIL-88B was stirred in deionized water
for 24 h, solids were then collected by vacuum filtration, and washed
with deionized water three times. Finally, the crystals were dried
in a vacuum oven at 65 °C for 24 h.

4.4 Drug
Loading Studies
Dry Fe-MIL crystals
were stirred in ibuprofen/hexane solutions with varying concentrations
for different set amount of times. The material-to-ibuprofen mass
ratio was kept at 1:3. We found that the best ibuprofen loading condition
for MIL-53 was stirring 50 mg of MIL-53 with 5 mL of ibuprofen/hexane
solution (30 mg/mL) for 72 h. The optimal ibuprofen loading condition
for MIL-88B was 20 mg of MIL-88 mixed with 6 mL of ibuprofen/hexane
(10 mg/mL) for 24 h. After desired soaking period, the drug encapsulated
crystals were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min.
The supernatant was saved for UV analysis for drug loading quantification.
The precipitate (Fe-MILs loaded with ibuprofen) was dried in a vacuum
oven at 65 °C for 24 h. The drug loading capacity (LC, mg of
ibuprofen per gram of material) of each Fe-MIL was evaluated based
on the following equation 1  where C0 is the initial ibuprofen concentration, Ct is the ibuprofen concentration at time t, V is the total volume of ibuprofen solution,
and m is the mass of Fe-MIL applied in the mixture
solution.

4.5 Drug Elution Studies
An amount of
10 mg of dry ibuprofen encapsulated MILs was soaked and stirred in
40 mL of PBS at room temperature for drug release studies. A 2 mL
aliquot of mixed solution was collected at each hour for the first
6 h, one sample was then collected each day for the next ten days.
The collected solution was filtered through a syringe filter (PVDF,
0.45 μm, 13 mm diameter) to remove large Fe-MIL solids before
analysis. Ibuprofen release amounts and Fe-MIL degradation rates were
examined by monitoring the changes in concentrations of ibuprofen
and TA over time using a reversed-phase HPLC. Horcajada et al. reported
a two-stage drug release profile for MIL-53 materials.10 In this study, we observed a similar trend on
both Fe-based MIL-53 and MIL-88B systems. The release kinetics of
each system on both stages was evaluated using different drug delivery
models, including zero-order, first-order, Peppas, Hixson–Crowell,
and Hill models. If a higher correlation coefficient is observed,
it confirms that the drug delivery system follows the corresponding
kinetic model.

A zero-order drug delivery model is commonly
used to describe the diffusion behaviors of a system and can be expressed
in the following equation34 2  where, Mt and M∞ represent the
absolute cumulative amount of released drug at the time t and at infinite time, and k is the release rate
constant. The ratio of Mt and M∞ represents the cumulative drug release
percent.

The first-order kinetic equation takes consideration
of material
degradation in water and can be expressed as followed35 3  

The Peppas model was first
proposed in 198536 and is now widely used
for modeling polymer-based drug
delivery systems with surface erosion. It can be expressed as the
following equation where n is the release exponent 4  

We also applied the Hixson–Crowell model to consider
a bulk-erosion
system since Fe-MILs may degrade into smaller crystals in physiological
environment. The Hixson–Crowell model can be expressed as follows37 5  

The Hill model was also applied to fit the cumulative drug
release
percent as a function of time. This model takes consideration of diffusion
and degradation processes of the matrices and can be expresses as
follows38 6  where M0 and MEq represent the drug release
amounts at time zero and at an equilibrium condition, and t1/2 represents the time when the slope of the
cumulative drug release curve has the highest value.

4.6 Cytotoxicity Studies
A CellTiter
96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (MTT) from Promega was
used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of MIL-88B with the NIH-3T3 Swiss
mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) cell line. Cells were cultured in complete
(10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin streptomycin-glutamine) Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere until 90% confluent. Sterile MIL-88B
(3.5 mg) was dissolved in DMEM through sonication to serve as stock
solution. PBS and trypsin were used to induce detachment of 3T3 cells.
In a 96-well plate, cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well. Concentrations (0.05–2.5 mg/mL) of the
stock solution were then added to the plate and incubated for 48 h.
Subsequently, the CellTiter 96 assay was performed. The plate reader
(Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash Reader) was used to record absorption
at 570 nm. Each point was calculated from 18 repeats: 6 wells, 3 plates.

4.7 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) measurements were carried out on a SmartLab X-Ray diffractometer
(Rigaku). Bragg–Brentano Focusing measurements were conducted
using a Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation
source. The diffraction angles of measurement were between 7 and 20
degrees with steps of 0.008 degrees.

Infrared spectroscopic
studies were performed on a Bruker Alpha I attenuated total reflectance
infrared (ATR-IR) spectrometer. All spectra were collected in the
range of 4000–400 cm–1 at a resolution of
4 cm–1 with 64 scans per spectrum.

N2 sorption studies of Fe-MILs before and after ibuprofen
loading were performed on a Micromeritics 2020PLUS surface characterization
analyzer at 77 K using liquid nitrogen. Prior to measurements, approximately
50 mg of sample was degassed under vacuum at 60 °C for over 12
h. The sample tube was immersed in a liquid nitrogen dewar during
measurements. The gas adsorption isotherms were collected as a function
of pressure up to 800 torr.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
FEI Quanta 650) was applied
to study the morphology changes of MIL-88B crystals before and after
drug loading. The images were taken with an acceleration voltage of
20 kV and a working distance of 9.4 mm in a high vacuum condition.
Gold-coated silicon substrates were coated with desired MIL crystal
samples by a dip-coater (Chemat Technology). For increased resolution,
all samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to SEM imaging.

A UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1700) was applied
to measure ibuprofen loading amounts by monitoring the wavelength
at 264 nm (λmax for ibuprofen in hexane). A standard
curve of ibuprofen in hexane was created based on a concentration
range of 0.001–0.025 mg/mL. The absorbance of ibuprofen before
and after drug loading was measured in triplicate with hexane as the
blank. For solutions with concentrations out of range of the standard
curve, samples were diluted with hexane before measurements.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Thermo Scientific,
Ultimate 3000) was employed to study drug release kinetics. A reverse-phase
C18 analytical column (Agilent, Zorbax 300SB-C18, 4.6 x 250 mm 5-μm)
was used along with the mobile phase of water and acetonitrile (50:50
v/v) with 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in each solvent with a pump rate
of 1.5 mL/min. The UV detector was set at wavelengths of 215 and 242
nm at room temperature. A sample volume of 20 μL was injected,
and all analyses were performed in triplicate. Standard calibration
curves of ibuprofen and TA in PBS were created separately by plotting
retention time peak area (mV × s) versus concentration. The peak
of ibuprofen was observed at a retention time of 5.2 min in a UV channel
of 215 nm. The peak of TA showed up at 1.9 min in the channel of 242
nm.
