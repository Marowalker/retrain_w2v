Band gaps and electron affinities of binary
and ternary, wurtzite (wz-) and zincblende (zb-) III-nitrides are
investigated using a unified hybrid density functional theory, and
band offsets between wz- and zb- alloys are calculated using Anderson’s
electron affinity model. A conduction (and valence) band offset of
1.85 (0.89) eV has been calculated for zb-GaN/InN heterojunctions,
which is 0.25 eV larger (and 0.26 eV smaller) than that of the wz-
counterpart. Such polarization-free zb-GaN/InGaN/GaN quantum well
structures with large conduction band offsets have the potential to
suppress electron leakage current and quantum-confined Stark effects
(QCSEs). Contrarily, the conduction (and valence) band offset of zb-AlN/GaN
heterojunctions is calculated to be 1.32 (0.43) eV, which is 1.15
eV smaller (and 0.13 eV larger) than that of the wz- case. The significant
reduction in zb-AlN/GaN band offsets is ascribed to the smaller and
indirect band gap of zb-AlN—the direct-to-indirect crossover
point in zb-AlXGa1–XN is when X ∼ 65%. The small
band gap of the zb-AlN barrier and the small conduction band offsets
imply that electrons can be injected into zb-AlN/GaN/AlN quantum well
heterostructures with small bias and less energy loss when captured
by the quantum wells, respectively, i.e., loss as heat is reduced.
The band gap of ternary III-nitrides does not linearly depend on alloy
compositions, implying a nonlinear dependence of band offsets on compositions.
As a result, the large bowing of the conduction band offset is identified
and ascribed to the cation-like behavior of the conduction band minimum,
while the linear dependence of the valence band offset on compositions
is attributed to the anion-like character of the valence band maximum.

I Introduction
III-nitrides
(i.e., AlXGaYIn(1–X–Y)N) have been instrumental in enabling ultraviolet
and blue1 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),
high-frequency high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs),2 and negative electron affinity photocathodes.3 These devices rely on quantum structures4 or buffer layers3 composed
of heterointerfaces. For instance, blue LEDs utilize GaN/InGaN/GaN
quantum well heterostructures to increase the electron–hole
spatial overlap for high emission efficiency, and HEMTs utilize AlGaN/GaN
heterojunctions to form a two-dimensional electron gas channel for
high-speed transport. These devices utilize the conventional wurtzite
(wz-) phase of the III-nitrides that comes with challenges.2 For instance, extending the LED spectrum from
blue to green for the use of green LEDs in white light generation
has been challenging as inherent spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization
in wz- III-nitrides cause the electron–hole spatial separation
in quantum wells (i.e., quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE)), limiting
the radiative efficiency. On the electronics side, the inherent spontaneous
and piezoelectric polarization in wz- III-nitrides cause HEMTs to
be normally on at all times, creating safety concerns in power electronics
applications.2 Zincblende (zb-) III-nitrides
offer a solution to overcome these challenges as they are free of
both spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization (in the ⟨001⟩
growth direction) thanks to the centrosymmetric crystal structure
while having similar benefits.

zb- III-nitrides are realized
traditionally via (i) direct deposition
on zb substrates (e.g., GaAs,5 3C–SiC,6 Si(100),7 and MgO8) and (ii) transforming the wz- phase into a
zb- one (ii.a) by impurity incorporation (such as Ga8)9 or (ii.b) by growth on V-10−12 or U-grooved13−15 patterned silicon
substrates. Benefiting from this emerging material system is only
possible through theoretically investigating the electronic properties.
Particularly, band gaps, effective masses, and band offsets are needed
to model the carrier dynamics in quantum structures.

We have
recently reported analytical equations on band gaps and
effective masses of wz- and zb- III-nitrides.16 Although band alignments between wz-AlN, GaN, and InN have been
reported experimentally,17 band alignments
between zb- III-nitrides remain vague. For instance, the reported
valence band offsets of the unstrained zb-AlN/GaN interface range
from 0.25 to 1.00 eV.17 The variance in
the reported band offset values is due to the choices of (i) approaches
used to construct the band structures (such as the hybrid density
functional theory, the k·p perturbation
theory, and the tight-binding model) and (ii) energy references (such
as the vacuum level, average electrostatic potentials, charge neutrality
levels, and branch-point energies).18

It is important to note that band alignments procured without the
impact of strain are known as natural or unstrained band alignments,
which are essential to determine the band alignments under a certain
strain condition by incorporating deformation potentials.19 In this work, a unified hybrid functional is
introduced to determine band gaps and electron affinities of unstrained
binary and ternary, wz- and zb- III-nitrides. The advantage of using
the unified approach is that method accuracy is verified by the reported
data on wz- III-nitrides, which enables calculating the electronic
properties of zb- III-nitrides with high reliability. Electron affinities
are calculated based on nonpolar wz- (101̅0) and zb- (110) planes
because earlier works show that interface orientations of (100), (110),
and (111) have minor impacts on valence band offsets.20 Band alignments of binary and ternary, wz- and zb- III-nitrides
are derived from band gaps and electron affinities using Anderson’s
electron affinity model.21

II Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the electron affinity of binary and ternary III-nitrides. The x-axis labels the alloys ranging from InN and GaN to AlN,
while the y-axis is the electron affinity. The black
solid line and red dashed line indicate the (101̅0) facet of
wz- alloys and the (110) facet of zb- alloys, respectively. Qualitatively,
the electron affinity of III-nitrides on the wz- (101̅0) and
zb- (110) facets has the analogous composition-dependent relation,
which reaches the maximum at InN regardless of wz- and zb- crystals
and decreases with respect to the increasing mole fraction of Al and
Ga. The electron affinity of the wz- alloys reaches the minimum at
AlN, while the electron affinity of the zb- alloys reaches the minimum
around Al0.75Ga0.25N because the conduction
band minimum shifts from Γ- to X-valley, which will be explained
later in light of the band alignments. Quantitatively, the electron
affinity of 3.92 eV is obtained on the (101̅0) facet of wz-GaN,
which agrees with 4.06 ± 0.07 eV measured on the same facet.22 It is worth noting that the electron affinity
of 2.6–3.8 eV had been widely reported on the polar (0001)
facet of wz-GaN.23,24 The reduction of the electron
affinity is attributed to the presence of surface adsorption and surface
polarity. For instance, the electron affinities of Ga- and N-polar
GaN surfaces have been reported to be 3.8 and 3.3 eV, respectively.23 Experiments and recent generalized gradient
approximation (GGA)-based simulations reveal that the electron concentration
accumulated around the Ga- and N-dangling bonds at the GaN surface
is too low to screen the spontaneous polarization-induced electric
field. Consequently, the spontaneous polarization-induced electric
field causes an upward surface band bending and leads to the reduction
of electron affinity.23,25 The calculated electron affinity
of wz-AlN is 1.45 eV, which falls within the experimental values ranging
from 0.25 ± 0.3 to 1.9 eV.26,27 Notably, the large
uncertainty is ascribed to the chemically active surface of AlN that
is vulnerable to oxygen contamination. For the electron affinity of
wz-InN, the measured range of 5.5–5.8 eV is deducted by the
conduction band offset of the wz-GaN/InN heterojunction and the electron
affinity of wz-GaN,28 which are consistent
with the theoretical values of 5.3 (In-polar c-plane)–5.8
(m-plane) eV using the GW calculation.29 Our Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)
approach procures 5.51 eV for the electron affinity of wz-InN, which
is in agreement with the experiments and the more advanced theory.

affinities of III-nitrides on the wz- (101̅0)
and zb- (110) planes. (b) Type-I and (c) type-II slabs for wz- III-nitrides
with 25 or 75% alloying.

The electron affinity
is sensitive to the atomic arrangement on
the surface. wz- crystal structure has two distinct point bases; therefore,
the unit cell used to build m-plane slabs involves
two asymmetric cation–anion bonds. Since the slabs are generated
by repeating the unit cell along the z-axis, two
distinct cation bases lead to different surface stoichiometries for
ternary wz- III-nitrides. If two different types of cations are involved
in the slab, one type of the cations can lie either on the surface
layer (type-I cation arrangement) or one atomic layer below the surface
layer (type-II cation arrangement), as shown in Figure 1b,c, respectively. The asymmetric cation
arrangements in the slab lead to different electron distributions,
electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments, which render the surface
band bending and the diminution of electron affinity.25,30 Consequently, each ternary wz- III-nitride with 25 and 75% alloying
ends in two distinct electron affinities depending on the surface
stoichiometry represented by the error bars in Figure 1. For example, the electron affinities of
wz-In0.25Ga0.75N are 5.52 (surface terminates
with an In–N bond) and 5.14 eV (surface terminates with a Ga–N
bond). Table 1 tabulates
the magnitude of the electron affinity and estimated dipole moments
for the type-I and type-II cation arrangements. It proves that two
different dipole moments are induced by the asymmetric surface stoichiometries.
The amplitude of the electron affinity variation is small when the
dipole moments are weak. The variation of the electron affinity directly
contributes to the variation of band alignments. Therefore, the average
value of electron affinities is exploited for band alignments, as
shown in Figure 2.

According to Anderson’s
electron affinity model, the band
diagram of III-nitrides can be aligned with respect to the vacuum
energy using the electron affinity and the band gap obtained from
the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Figure 2 summarizes the conduction
(Ec) and valence (Ev) band edges of wz-InGaN, AlGaN, and AlInN indicated by the
black solid line and red dashed line, respectively. Instead of using
the vacuum energy as a reference level, the band edges are shifted
relative to the valence band edge of wz-GaN for convenience. The conduction
and valence band offsets between arbitrary two materials can be determined
by the difference of Ec and Ev, respectively. As a result, the wz- alloys exhibit type-I
band alignments, where the conduction (and valence) band offsets of
wz-GaN/InN, wz-AlN/GaN, and wz-AlN/InN heterojunctions are 1.60 (1.15),
2.47 (0.30), and 4.07 (1.45) eV, leading to the ratios of conduction
band offsets to band-gap differences of 0.58, 0.89, and 0.74, respectively.
Before further exploration, it is important to validate the accuracy
of the methodology through experimental measurements. To begin with,
the valence band offset of 1.05 ± 0.25 eV has been probed experimentally
for wz-GaN/InN heterojunctions,31 which
is in agreement with our simulation result of 1.15 eV. On the other
hand, the calculated valence band offset of the wz-AlN/GaN heterostructure
(0.3 eV) is consistent with the X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement
of 0.3 ± 0.1 eV,32 while, for wz-AlN/InN
heterostructures, the calculated valence band offset of 1.45 eV agrees
with the X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurement of 1.4 ±
0.1 eV.33 Notably, the deviation between
the experiment and simulation and the uncertainty in experiments are
ascribed to the variation of defectivity, strain, stoichiometry, surface
polarity, and the chemical potency of reference core levels. Based
on the validated methodology, the band alignments of zb- III-nitrides
are calculated. Figure 3 demonstrates the conduction (black solid line) and valence (red
dashed line) band edges of binary and ternary zb- III-nitrides relative
to the valence band edge of zb-GaN. The blue-star symbols indicate
the conduction band edge at Γ-valley for indirect-gap alloys.
The direct-to-indirect crossover point of zb-Al0.65Ga0.35N is interpolated by zb-Al0.50Ga0.50N and zb-Al0.75Ga0.25N when the conduction
band minimum at Γ-valley has the same energy as that of X-valley.
The crossover point is close to zb-Al0.70Ga0.30N derived from the local density approximation (LDA-1/2) approach.16 Similar to the wz- heterojunctions, type-I band
alignments are observed among the zb- III-nitrides, where the conduction
(and valence) band offsets of zb-GaN/InN, zb-AlN/GaN, and zb-AlN/InN
heterojunctions are 1.85 (0.89), 1.32 (0.43), and 3.17 (1.32) eV,
leading to the ratios of conduction band offsets to band-gap differences
of 0.68, 0.75, and 0.71, respectively. Since the research in zb- III-nitrides
is still in early stages, only the experimental band offsets of the
zb-AlN/GaN heterojunction are available for validation. The conduction
and valence band offsets of the zb-AlN/GaN heterojunction obtained
from simulations are in agreement with the conduction and valence
band offsets of 1.4 ± 0.1 and 0.5 ± 0.1 eV measured from
inter-sub-band transition energies, where the ratio of the conduction
band offset to the band-gap difference is 0.74 ± 0.05.34 A constant mixing parameter of 0.25 had been
reported to study the band gap of zb-AlN and zb-GaN and the band offsets
of the zb-AlN/GaN heterojunction.34 Consequently,
the constant mixing parameter of 0.25 significantly underestimates
the band gap of zb-AlN and zb-GaN by 0.74 and 0.38 eV, respectively,
while the conduction and valence band offsets are 1.22 and 0.42 eV,
which are 0.10 and 0.01 eV smaller than our results obtained using
dynamic mixing parameters. The larger difference in the conduction
band offset can be majorly attributed to the inaccurate band gaps
and band-gap difference, whereas the consistent valence band offset
implies a weak dependence on the mixing parameter. The previous study
improves the accuracy of band gaps through the computationally expensive
GW calculation; however, in this study, the dynamic mixing parameters
are adopted for the same purpose. As a result, the conduction band
offset reported after the GW correction is 1.31 eV, which is consistent
with our results. Therefore, the main benefit of using dynamic mixing
parameters is to improve the overall reliability and accuracy of band
gaps, band-gap difference, and conduction band offset without using
computationally expensive approaches. In short, the band offsets of
binary wz- and zb- alloys are tabulated in Table 2.

a The ratios
of conduction band offsets
to band-gap differences are listed. The experimental conduction band
offsets (ΔEcexp) are derived by assuming that the band gaps
of wz-AlN, wz-GaN, wz-InN, zb-AlN, and zb-GaN are 6.2, 3.4, 0.7, 5.3,
and 3.3 eV, respectively.

The determination of band alignments in ternary III-nitrides is
more complicated since it depends on the surface stoichiometry, as
discussed in Figure 1, and the band-edge physics. The element-projected electronic structure
of binary wz- and zb- III-nitrides is calculated to study the band-edge
physics, as shown in Figure 4. The red–light green colormap indicates anion-like
behavior, while the light green–blue colormap implies cation-like
behavior. From observation in Figures 2 and 3, the valence band edge
of ternary alloys can be linearly interpolated, though with a slight
upward bowing for AlInN and InGaN. This is because the valence band
maximum of AlN, GaN, and InN is composed mainly of anion orbital states
regardless of wz- or zb- crystals. The anion-like character makes
the valence band edge less sensitive to group-III alloying, which
leads to the small bowing of valence band offsets. The slight upward
bowing on the valence band edges of AlInN and InGaN can be ascribed
to the energy shift of the valence band maximum with respect to the
average energy of the top three valence bands at Γ-valley.35 On the contrary, the conduction band edge of
ternary alloys, except AlGaN, exhibits large bowing, which dominantly
contributes to the band-gap bowing in both wz- and zb- crystals. Revealed
by the element-projected electronic structure of wz-AlN, GaN, and
InN, the conduction band minimum of wz-AlN at Γ-valley retains
anion-like behavior; however, it dwindles as the increasing mole fraction
of Ga and turns into a cation-like character in wz-InN. The anion-like
conduction band edges in wz-AlGaN explain the relatively small bowing,
whereas the cation-like conduction band edges in wz-AlInN and InGaN
account for the large bowing. Likewise, the conduction band minima
of zb-AlN, GaN, and InN at Γ-valley have the same anion-to-cation
transition. Hence, the large bowing in the conduction band edges of
zb-AlInN and InGaN is consistent with that of the wz- counterparts.
A small bowing in the conduction band edges of zb-AlGaN is observed
for zb-GaN, Al0.25Ga0.75N, and Al0.5Ga0.5N, but not for zb-Al0.75Ga0.25N and AlN because the conduction band minimum of zb-Al0.75Ga0.25N and AlN shifts from Γ-valley to X-valley.
In comparison with the anion-like Γ-valley, X-valley has a strong
cation-like character. Therefore, the conduction band minimum of zb-Al0.75Ga0.25N and AlN at Γ-valley has the expected
small bowing, but the conduction band minimum of zb-Al0.75Ga0.25N and AlN at X-valley behaves oppositely.

(c) wz-InN, (d) zb-AlN, (e) zb-GaN, and (f) zb-InN. The red–light
green colormap indicates an anion-like character, while the light
green–blue colormap represents cation-like behavior.

By comparing the band offsets of the zb- alloys
with those of the
wz- alloys, the larger conduction band offset of the zb-GaN/InN heterojunction
implies that LEDs made out of zb-GaN/InGaN quantum wells have a better
electron capture rate, which suppresses electron leakage current.
Likewise, the larger valence band offset of zb-AlN/GaN heterojunctions
indicates a better hole capture rate in zb-AlGaN/GaN quantum wells.
However, the conduction band offset of zb-AlN/GaN heterojunctions
is significantly smaller than that of wz-AlN/GaN heterojunctions because
zb-AlN has a small indirect band gap of 5.0–5.3 eV. Indeed,
if we only consider the Γ-valley where the direct band gap occurs,
the conduction band offsets of zb-AlGaN/GaN heterojunctions are identical
to those of wz-AlGaN/GaN ones. For instance, the conduction band offsets
of the zb-Al0.25Ga0.75N/GaN and zb-AlN/GaN heterojunctions
are 0.57 and 2.51 eV in comparison with those of 0.52 and 2.47 eV
in wz-Al0.25Ga0.75N/GaN and wz-AlN/GaN heterojunctions,
respectively. The advantages of zb-AlN/GaN quantum wells over wz-AlN/GaN
quantum wells are that the smaller band gap of the AlN barrier allows
its devices to inject carriers with lower bias, whereas the smaller
conduction band offset reduces energy loss when the electrons are
captured by the quantum wells. Given the inherent polarization-free
nature of zb-AlN/GaN quantum wells in the ⟨100⟩ direction,
the electron capture of the shallow quantum wells can be increased
using thicker quantum well designs with no QCSE. As a result, zb-AlN/GaN
quantum wells are promising for energy-efficient emitters.

III Conclusions
In summary, band gaps, electron affinities,
and band alignments
of wz- and zb- III-nitrides are calculated using a unified HSE06 hybrid
functional, while the mixing parameters are calibrated from the experimental
band gap of binary wz- III-nitrides. The band diagrams of III-nitrides
are aligned using Anderson’s electron affinity model. The conduction
(and valence) band offsets of 1.60 (1.15) and 1.85 (0.89) eV are procured
for the wz-GaN/InN and zb-GaN/InN heterojunctions. With polarization-free
nature and large conduction band offsets, zb-GaN/InGaN/GaN quantum
well heterostructures are promising to ameliorate electron capture
and QCSE, leading to better radiative efficiency. On the other hand,
the conduction (and valence) band offsets of 2.47 (0.30) and 1.32
(0.43) eV are obtained for the wz-AlN/GaN and zb-AlN/GaN heterojunctions.
Devices made by the zb-AlN/GaN/AlN quantum well heterostructures are
expected to be more energy-efficient than those of the wz- counterparts
since the small band gap of the zb-AlN barrier and the small conduction
band offsets indicate small bias and less energy loss when electrons
are captured by the quantum wells, respectively. The band-gap bowing
in wz- and zb- III-nitrides is dominantly contributed from the nonlinear
dependence of the conduction band offset on compositions. We have
found that the large bowing of the conduction band offsets is attributed
to the cation-like conduction band minimum at Γ-valley, whereas
the linear dependence of the valence band offsets is ascribed to the
anion character of the valence band maximum.

IV Computational
Methods
Band gaps and electron affinities of wz- and zb-
III-nitrides are
calculated under the density functional theory (DFT) framework implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).36 Projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials with a cutoff
kinetic energy of 500 eV are employed. Simulations are boiled down
to bulk and slab calculations. In the bulk calculations, the conduction
and valence band edges relative to the average electrostatic potential
of the unit cell are determined. An eight-atom simple orthorhombic
unit cell, which has the lattice vector c⃗
parallel to (101̅0), is built for the wz- III-nitrides, while
an eight-atom conventional cell is built for the zb- III-nitrides.
A 6 × 4 × 4 and 5 × 5 × 5 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack
set of k-points are sampled for the wz- and zb- unit
cells, respectively. Local density approximation (LDA) and generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) are well-known approaches to study the
exchange–correlation interaction of ground-state electrons,
but the excited states and band gap of III–V materials are
commonly underestimated, which results in the inaccurate electron
affinity and band offset overestimation.37,38 Therefore, the HSE06 functional, which fixes band-gap underestimation
by mixing the Hartree–Fock exchange energy with the Perdew–Becke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange energy, is adopted to describe the exchange–correlation
interaction of III-nitrides. The optimal mixing parameters (α)
of 0.341, 0.302, and 0.271 are found to reproduce the experimental
band gaps of wz-AlN, GaN, and InN, respectively, while the optimal
α of ternary III-nitrides is linearly interpolated by  where x and y are the Al and Ga mole fractions, respectively.
Details of finding
the optimal α and accuracy of the linear interpolation are summarized
in the supporting information (Figure S1). In the slab calculations, the vacuum energy is extracted using
the macroscopic average of the electrostatic potential in the III-nitride
thin film as a reference level. However, the thickness of the III-nitride
thin film in the slab calculations should be large enough to recover
the bulk-like electrostatic potential. According to the convergence
tests (Figure S2), a 12-layer III-nitride
thin film is large enough to recover the bulk-like electrostatic potential,
which guarantees the accuracy of electron affinity. Therefore, 12-layer
wz- and zb- slabs terminated with nonpolar (101̅0) and (110)
facets are generated from the preconverged bulk structures, respectively.
An 18 Å vacuum space is reserved in the slabs. A 3 × 2 ×
1 and 2 × 2 × 1 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack set
of k-points are sampled for the wz- and zb- slabs,
respectively. Each atom in the slabs is fully relaxed so that the
interatomic force and energy difference are smaller than 0.01 eV Å–1 and 10–6 eV, respectively. The
macroscopic average of the electrostatic potential along the growth
direction z of slabs is estimated by  where l, A, Θ, and V are the interlayer distance
along
the z-direction, the cross-sectional area of the
slabs perpendicular to the z-direction, the Heaviside
function, and the three-dimensional electrostatic potential of the
slabs, respectively. The inner integral averages
the electrostatic potential over the periodic directions so-called
microscopic average, while the outer integral averages the periodic
oscillation of the microscopic potential along the growth direction.
Under the assumption that the average electrostatic potential of unit
cells is identical to the macroscopic average of the electrostatic
potential in the III-nitride thin film of the slabs, the electron
affinity can be extracted by  where Evac and  are the vacuum energy and the macroscopic
average of the electrostatic potential in the III-nitride thin film
procured from the slab calculations, while Eg, VBM, and  are the band gap, the valence band maximum,
and the average electrostatic potential of the unit cell obtained
from the bulk calculations, respectively.
