An
amphiphilic block copolymer (BCP) which contains both photoresponsive
and thermoresponsive blocks was synthesized by the atom transfer radical
polymerization approach. Meanwhile, a new core/shell type of the upconversion
nanoparticle (UCNP) LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01@LiYF4:Yb3+0.2 was successfully synthesized. By encapsulating UCNPs inside
the micelles of the BCP and incorporating Nile red (NR) into the UCNP@BCP
hybrid nanoparticles as a model drug, controlled release of the drug
by the dual-stimuli BCP could be studied. After exposing the UCNP-loaded
micellar solution to near-infrared (NIR) light, it was found that
the UV light pumped from UCNPs could disrupt the polymer micelles
and the fluorescence intensity of NR decreased with the increase of
the irradiation time of the NIR light. The thermoresponsive study
indicated that the fluorescence intensity of NR decreased with the
increase of temperature of the micellar solution because of the release
of NR into water arising from the contraction of the amphiphilic BCP.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, stimuli-sensitive materials have attracted considerable
attention in a vast variety of applications. Among them, stimuli-responsive
polymers have gained practical and enhanced interests owing to their
response to external stimuli such as variation of temperature, light,
pH, pressure, magnetic and electric fields, and so forth.1−6 Multistimuli-responsive polymers have recently been paid more attention
because of the variation in property control.7−10 To trigger the multistimuli action,
the stimuli-responsive polymer must possess a block copolymer (BCP)
structure with each block facilitating the response to the variation
of environmental conditions such as temperature, light, and so forth.
In addition, the BCP is often a type of amphiphilic micelle in aqueous
media for biomedical applications. By incorporating appropriate photoresponsive
moieties into a BCP, the polymeric micelles can be disrupted through
photochemical reactions such as trans–cis isomerization, molecular
dimerization, and bond cleavage. Alternatively, a temperature-sensitive
polymer can be transferred from a hydrophilic state to a hydrophobic
state when the solution temperature is raised above the lower critical
solution temperature (LCST). Hence, this type of polymer is also frequently
used as a stimulus-responsive material in a wide range of applications.11,12

However, all explored photoreactions require strong radiation,
such as UV or visible light, which may cause a serious injury to organisms.
In this regard, triggering the action of a photoresponsive polymeric
micelle by near-infrared (NIR) light may be an appealing alternative
because of the less detrimental radiation and deeper penetration compared
to ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) light. To achieve this goal, lanthanide-doped
upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for use in converting NIR radiation
into UV/vis light have been recently developed.13,14 By employing this method, combining UCNPs and photoresponsive polymers
in hybrid nanocapsules has become a widely applied strategy for use
in NIR-triggered drug delivery.15−19

UCNPs are usually composed of lanthanide-doped transition
metals
and are dilute guest–host systems. Lanthanide ions are dispersed
as a guest in a proper dielectric host lattice with a dimension of
less than 100 nm. These Ln3+ ions are optically active
centers and can exhibit sharp luminescence emissions via intra-4f
or 4f–5d transitions.20,21 Through judicious selection
of lanthanide dopants including the sensitizer and activator, UCNPs
can display anti-Stokes emission such as NIR to shorter NIR, visible,
or UV light by upconversion mechanisms. In addition, selection of
appropriate host materials is crucial for high-efficiency upconversion
emissions. As for the host materials, NaYF4 is one of the
most studied material.15,21−24 To the best of our knowledge,
LiYF4 is rarely studied to date. On the other hand, it
has been indicated that the utilization of a core/shell structure
can enhance the fluorescence intensity of UCNPs. There are three types
of core/shell structures that have been utilized to enhance the photoluminescence
(PL) intensity of UCNPs.25,26 In this study, we adopt
the active core/active shell structure, in which the host material
and the sensitizer of the shell are the same as those of the core
materials.25−29 Owing to the sensitizer dopant in the shell, the active shell can
not only protect the core from surface defects but also transfer absorbed
NIR light from the pump source to the core UCNP. Therefore, the sensitizer-doped
active shell can significantly enhance the fluorescence intensity
of UCNPs.

This research aims to design and synthesize a dual-stimuli
BCP
in conjunction with the upconversion function of a new type of LiYF4 core/shell UCNP for application in controlled release of
drugs. The strategy is based on that hydrophobic UCNPs and water insoluble
drugs tend to be entrapped in the hydrophobic core of polymer micelles,
while the hydrophilic polymer shell stabilizes the whole nanocapsule
in aqueous solution. The dual-stimuli BCP consists of a photosensitive
block and a temperature-sensitive block which are hydrophobic and
hydrophilic, respectively. Upon encapsulation of a model drug, Nile
red (NR) dye, into the diblock copolymer, the phenomenon of controlled
release of drugs can be monitored by the variation of the temperature.
When the temperature is raised above the LCST of the thermoresponsive
block, the amphiphilic BCP will shrink and squeeze NR out of the BCP.
Alternatively, when both NR and LiYF4 UCNPs are loaded
into the amphiphilic BCP, the UV emission from UCNPs can cleave the
photoresponsive block; thus, the hydrophobic core becomes hydrophilic.
As a result, the polymeric micelles are disrupted and release the
model drug (NR) into aqueous media.

Hence, by using the hybrid
UCNP@BCP strategy, the controlled release
of encapsulated molecules in the UCNP@BCP hybrid nanoparticles could
be accomplished effectively by photostimulation for biomedical applications.
On the other hand, to mimic the environmental change and enhance the
function of drug delivery, incorporation of a temperature-sensitive
segment into the polymeric micelles coupled with a photoresponsive
segment could be a more effective approach for application in biotechnology.

In this study, we employed a single activator/sensitizer combination
of Tm3+/Yb3+ to prepare a new kind of lanthanide-doped
core/shell UCNP. This kind of UCNP has the active core/active shell
structure, which can enhance the fluorescence intensity of the UCNP
significantly. Upon excitation with a 980 nm NIR laser diode, the
UCNPs can emit fluorescence spanning from the UV to NIR region. Because
this kind of UCNP can emit fluorescence in the UV region, which can
disrupt the photoresponsive polymeric micelles to release the encapsulated
molecules, the BCP employed in the encapsulation of the loaded UCNPs
and the model drug should contain the photosensitive segment. In addition,
a thermoresponsive polymeric segment with a LCST lower than the temperature
of human body (37 °C) is thought to be suitable as the temperature-sensitive
block along with the photoresponsive block in the synthesis of the
dual-stimuli BCP. In aqueous media, this diblock copolymer could self-assemble
into polymeric micelles with the photosensitive segments as the hydrophobic
core and the thermosensitive segments as the hydrophilic shell. Upon
UV irradiation, the photosensitive segments perform the photolysis
reaction and trigger the dissociation of the polymeric micelles. At
the temperature above the LCST, the polymeric micelles shrink because
of a decrease of the hydrophilicity of the thermosensitive segments;
hence, the encapsulated molecules are squeezed out. Furthermore, because
it has been indicated that UV/vis light can cleave chemical groups
(called photocleavable/photoremovable/photolabile groups) such as o-nitrobenzyl- and coumarin-based groups30−32 and the UV
light emitted from our synthesized UCNPs overlaps well with the absorption
band of o-nitrobenzyl groups (around 362 nm), we
designed an amphiphilic BCP composed of the hydrophobic block poly(o-nitrobenzyl acrylate) (PNBA) bearing the o-nitrobenzyl groups as the photosensitive block. On the other hand,
because poly(N-alkyl (meth)acrylamide)s are perhaps
the most heavily studied thermoresponsive polymers,33 we designed the amphiphilic BCP containing poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEAAm) as the
hydrophilic block. The as-synthesized amphiphilic BCP is designated
as PDEAAm-b-PNBA.

2 Results
and Discussion
The new nanocomposite UCNP@BCP was prepared
and NR was encapsulated
to simulate the process of controlled release of drugs. In this work,
a core/shell-type UCNP with emission of UV light at 361 nm has been
synthesized. In addition, a new type of dual stimuli-responsive BCP
composed of a photosensitive and temperature-sensitive block by atom
transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been synthesized (Figure 1). To our knowledge,
this kind of LiYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@LiYF4:Yb3+ core/shell UCNP has not been studied in combination
with the newly synthesized, dual stimuli-responsive BCP PDEAAm-b-PNBA. The controlled release triggered by the dual-stimuli
approach is illustrated in Figure 2.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to investigate
the crystal structure of the LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01 UCNP core and LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01@LiYF4:Yb3+0.2 core/shell UCNP.
From the upper XRD pattern, the sharp and intense peaks from (101),
(112), and (202) planes, as shown in Figure 3, the crystal structure of the core UCNP
can be indexed as the tetragonal phase (JCPDS no. 17-0874). After
coating the LiYF4:Yb3+ shell, it shows peaks
that are similar to those of the core UCNP, as evident from the lower
pattern of Figure 3. Because the shell composition is almost the same as that of the
core, the XRD pattern of the core/shell UCNP is very similar to the
pattern of its corresponding core UCNP.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of the LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01 core UCNP and LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01@LiYF4:Yb3+0.2 core/shell UCNP.

Figure 4a,b depicts
the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images
of the core and core/shell UCNP. As seen from these images, both the
core UCNP and core/shell UCNP appear to be rhombus-shaped and monodispersed
under high magnification (×500 K). The aspect ratio (length/breadth)
of the diagonal is ca. 1.35 for the core UCNP and 1.64 for the core/shell
UCNP. After shell coverage, both diagonal lengths of the core/shell
UCNP increase significantly. This confirms the formation of the LiYF4 shell on the UCNP core and demonstrates why the XRD pattern
of the core/shell type UCNP is very similar to that of the core UCNP.
The d-spacing from HRTEM was determined to be 0.268
nm, which matches well with the distance between the (202) planes
in LiYF4 (Figure 4c). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
in Figure 4d shows
that the SAED pattern consists of many spots, which demonstrates that
the LiYF4 core/shell UCNP has the single-crystal structure.
The SAED pattern further illustrates the formation of the tetragonal
phase of the core/shell UCNP and is indexed to the corresponding (hkl) planes according to the standard JCPDS no. 17-0874.

Because our research goal was to prepare a kind of UCNP with
the
function of emitting UV radiation to disrupt the micelles of the dual-stimuli
BCP, the intensity of UV emission in relation to the doping concentrations
of Yb3+ sensitizer and Tm3+ activator was studied.
It was found that an optimum combination of Yb3+ and Tm3+ was 25 mol % Yb3+ and 1 mol % Tm3+ for the UCNP core. As for the shell of the UCNP, only Yb3+ sensitizer was needed to be used as the dopant of the LiYF4 host material, and the optimal ratio was around 20 mol %.

The PL spectra of the colloidal LiYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ UCNP core and LiYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@LiYF4:Yb3+ core/shell UCNP under laser
excitation at 980 nm are shown in Figure 5. Several PL bands ranging from the UV to
visible region are observed. For both core UCNP and core/shell UCNP,
it can be found that their maxima are at 362, 451, 484, 649, and 687
nm, which correspond to 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4, 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4, and 3F3 → 3H6, respectively.
The UV range before 350 nm is beyond the detection range of our spectrometer
setup. It is striking that the intensities of all PL bands are much
enhanced after overcoating the shell. This is very beneficial for
the disruption of the BCP which contains photoresponsive segment units.

photographs of solutions of the core UCNP and core/shell UCNP, respectively.

In the preparation of the BCP
for controlled release of drugs via
the dual-stimuli function, we have synthesized an amphiphilic dual-stimuli
BCP composed of a thermoresponsive building block and a photoresponsive
building block. The thermoresponsive block was synthesized from N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEAAm) and functions
as the hydrophilic segment, while the photoresponsive block was synthesized
from 2-nitrobenzyl acrylate (NBA) and functions as the hydrophobic
segment. The as-synthesized dual-stimuli BCP was characterized by
proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), IR, gel permeation
chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
(Supporting Information). The number average
molecular weight () of the copolymer PDEAAm-b-PNBA
is shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). It is ca. 11 000 g/mol with a polydispersity index of 1.28.
Because the ratio of m and n of
the copolymer PDEAAm-b-PNBA obtained from the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1, Supporting Information) is about 1:3, the average values of m and n calculated are ca. 18.3 and 54.8, respectively.

NR is a common dye and was used as a model drug to simulate the
process of controlled release of drugs. After UCNP and NR were encapsulated
into the amphiphilic BCP, the NR-loaded UCNP@BCP hybrid was first
dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Subsequently, the solution was
poured into water and then THF was evaporated to form an amphiphilic
micelle solution in aqueous media. The HRTEM images of the UCNP-loaded
BCP micelles and the UCNP and NR co-loaded BCP micelles are shown
in Figures S5 and S6 (Supporting Information). From both figures, it is apparent that UCNPs are loaded into the
BCP micelles. Upon NIR irradiation at 980 nm, the nitrobenzyl groups
on the PNBA block were cleaved because of the 362 nm UV radiation
emitted by UCNPs. Photocleavage of the nitrobenzyl groups converted
the PNBA block into the hydrophilic polyacrylic acid, which rendered
the disruption of the micelles and the release of NR. On the other
hand, after raising the temperature above the LCST of the amphiphilic
BCP, the micelles contracted and the NR molecules in the micelles
were squeezed out. Hence, the controlled release of drugs could be
proceeded by two different ways via the dual-stimuli BCP.

To
illustrate the trigger function of drug release by using the
micelle solution formed from the UCNP-loaded BCP, we further performed
experiments to ensure the dissociation of micelles upon exposure of
NR-loaded UCNP@BCP nanocarriers under irradiation of a 980 nm NIR
laser diode. For comparison, the NR-loaded UCNP@BCP micellar solution
was irradiated with UV and NIR light. Because NR is a hydrophobic
dye and emits light around 625 nm, the emission intensity of the NR-loaded
UCNP@BCP micellar solution in water under 365 nm UV or 980 nm NIR
light irradiation was measured. As shown in Figure 6a, the PL intensity of NR decreases with
the increase of irradiation time of UV light, indicating that more
NR dye was released to water from the micelles. Because the NR dye
was hydrophobic, if more NR dye remained in micelles, the PL intensity
around 625 nm would be stronger. Hence, the decrease of PL intensity
indicates that more of the o-nitrobenzyl moieties
in the micelle core were cleaved by UV light and the PNBA block turned
into the hydrophilic polyacrylic acid segment. To demonstrate the
trigger function by the as-synthesized UCNP, the NR-loaded UCNP@BCP
micellar solution was irradiated under NIR light; it was also found
that the PL intensity of NR decreases with the increase of irradiation
time (Figure 6b). Although
the irradiation time is much longer than that of the micellar solution
irradiated directly by UV light, this may be a beneficial factor for
use in the drug delivery of an extended-release formulation. Moreover,
as mentioned above, NIR irradiation is less detrimental and has deeper
penetration to organisms compared to UV/vis light. The PL results
strongly support that the core/shell UCNPs were encapsulated by the
BCP and could emit UV light under NIR irradiation. The photos in the
insets of Figure 6a,b
display that after longer irradiation time, the purple color would
turn into a light color because more NR molecules were released into
water. This is a strong evidence to illustrate that our UCNP@BCP hybrid
can be used to control the drug release.

365 nm UV irradiation or (b) 980 nm NIR light exposure. The insets
(from left to right) are the corresponding photographs of the micellar
solutions before and after UV or NIR irradiation.

Furthermore, to test the function of the thermoresponsive
block
of the BCP, we carried out an experiment to detect the LCST of PDEAAm-b-PNBA. It was found that the polymeric solution turned
turbid when the temperature was raised above 25 °C (Figure 7a). It indicated
that the amphiphilic BCP turned hydrophobic in aqueous media because
of the PDEAAm thermoresponsive segment and the LCST of PDEAAm-b-PNBA was around 25 °C. Subsequently, we studied the
controlled-release process of the loaded NR molecules triggered by
the thermoresponsive block. As shown in Figure 7b, it can be found that the emission intensity
around 625 nm decreases with the increase of the temperature. We tested
the temperature from 20 to 37 °C to simulate the drug release
process in the human body. The result indicates that the NR dye has
been squeezed out from the NR-loaded micelles because of the contraction
of the polymeric micelles above the LCST of PDEAAm-b-PNBA.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
an amphiphilic photoresponsive and thermoresponsive
BCP which contains both thermoresponsive N-alkyl-substituted
acrylamide group and photoresponsive o-nitrobenzyl
group has been successfully synthesized. To achieve the design goal
of using this dual-stimuli BCP in controlled release of drugs under
photostimulation conditions, a core/shell UCNP with the structure
of LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01@LiYF4:Yb3+0.2 and
anti-Stokes emission of UV light was prepared and loaded into the
polymeric micelles. Upon NIR light exposure, the BCP displayed an
extended release of the model drug NR because of the disruption of
the BCP in the aqueous solution. Alternatively, in the case of the
BCP in which only NR was loaded, the behavior of the controlled release
could be observed when the temperature was raised above the LCST of
the BCP. Both results confirmed that the synthesized PDEAAm-b-PNBA BCP in conjunction with the LiYF4 core/shell
UCNP could be applied as an effective nanocarrier for controlled release
of drugs under the stimulation of photochange or temperature change.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of the Core UCNP
LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01
UCNPs of LiYF4 doped with 25% of Yb3+ and
1% Tm3+ ions were synthesized by the thermal decomposition
approach. At first, thulium and lithium trifluoroacetate precursors
in the presence of oleic acid coordinating ligands and non-coordinating
1-octadecene solvent molecules were prepared. First, 0.1094 g (1.48
mmol) of Li2CO3, 0.1671 g of Y2O3 (0.74 mmol), 0.0985 g (0.25 mmol) of Yb2O3, and 0.0039 g (0.01 mmol) of Tm2O3 were
dissolved in 10 mL of 50% (v/v % in water) concentrated trifluoroacetic
acid in a three-necked 100 mL flask and heated at 90 °C for 30
min. Next, 15 mL of oleic acid and 15 mL of 1-octadecene were added
into the three-necked flask. The resulting solution was then heated
at 120 °C under vacuum for 30 min with magnetic stirring to remove
water and oxygen. The light yellow solution was then heated to 300
°C at a rate of about 30 °C per minute under argon gas protection
and kept at this temperature under vigorous stirring for about 1 h.
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and precipitated
in ethanol and collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min.
The precipitate was dissolved in hexane and then reprecipitated in
ethanol. The procedure was repeated two times, and the nanoparticles
were dispersed in 10 mL of hexane for further synthesis steps.

4.2 Synthesis of the Core/Shell UCNP LiYF4:Yb3+0.25,Tm3+0.01@LiYF4:Yb3+0.2
The procedure
for the growth of the shell on the core UCNP is similar to that of
the synthesis of the core UCNP. First, 0.1182 g (1.60 mmol) of Li2CO3, 0.1806 g of Y2O3 (0.80
mmol), and 0.0788 g (0.20 mmol) of Yb2O3 were
dissolved in 10 mL of 50% (v/v % in water) concentrated trifluoroacetic
acid in a three-necked 100 mL flask and heated at 90 °C for 30
min. Next, 15 mL of oleic acid and 15 mL of 1-octadecene were added
into the three-necked flask. The resulting solution was then heated
at 120 °C under vacuum for 30 min. At this time, the core solution
was poured into the flask. The reaction was continued until the solution
turned light yellow to remove hexane and water. The reaction mixture
was then heated to 300 °C at a rate of about 30 °C per minute
under argon gas protection and kept at this temperature under vigorous
stirring for about 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,
and the product was precipitated and purified according to the procedures
as mentioned above. Thus, the active-core/active-shell structured
UCNPs were obtained.

4.3 Synthesis of the BCP PDEAAm-b-PNBA
NBA was prepared according to the reported
procedure.34 The amphiphilic BCP of PDEAAm-b-PNBA was synthesized by ATRP. At first, DEAAm (2.3 g,
18 mmol) was
dissolved in 8 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The solution was degassed
three times using the freeze–pump–thaw procedure under
the protection of an argon atmosphere. Next, the purified CuBr (0.015
g, 0.11 mmol) and bipyridine (0.02 g, 0.13 mmol) were added sequentially.
After the initiator, 1-bromoethyl benzene (0.12 g, 0.6 mmol), was
added, the reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C for 3 h. The
synthesized PDEAAm was used as a macroinitiator agent to polymerize
with NBA. The NBA (0.38 g, 1.8 mmol) in 1 mL DMSO was also degassed
three times using the freeze–pump–thaw procedure and
sealed under vacuum. Thereafter, the NBA monomer was added into the
flask and the reaction was continued for 3 h at 80 °C. Then,
the mixture was exposed to air and cooled to room temperature to quench
the polymerization. Afterward, the flask was removed from the oil
bath and the reaction mixture was diluted with THF. The solution was
filtered through a column with neutral alumina to remove the catalyst.
The final BCP was recovered by precipitation in methanol, filtering,
and then drying under vacuum for 48 h.

4.4 Characterization
The XRD patterns
of the core UCNP and core/shell UCNP were obtained by using a Bruker
D8 ADVANCE diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation with a step
size of 0.05° and a scanning speed of 4°/min. TEM images
were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope.
UV/vis spectra were collected on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV–vis
spectrophotometer. PL spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Upconversion PL measurements were performed on
a Ray Lead Tech. spectrofluorometer. A 980 nm laser diode (SDL-980-LM-5000T-Diode
Laser) with a power of 3 W/cm2 was employed as the excitation
source. Infrared spectra of the samples were obtained with a Bio-Rad
FTS 165 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer over the frequency
range of 4000–400 cm–1 at a resolution of
4 cm–1. 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE 400 FT-NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard. The molecular weight of the BCP was determined
by GPC using a Young Lin Acme 9000 liquid chromatograph equipped with
a 410 refractive index detector and μ-Styragel columns with
THF as the carrier solvent and polystyrene standards used for calibration.
