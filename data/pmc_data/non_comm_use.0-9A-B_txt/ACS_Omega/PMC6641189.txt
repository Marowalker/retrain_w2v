Aprotic lithium–air batteries
have recently drawn considerable
attention due to their ultrahigh specific energy. However, the chemical
and electrochemical instability of the electrolyte is one of the most
critical issues that need to be overcome. To increase the stability
and maintain a relatively high conductivity of the lithium ion, a
mixed electrolyte of sulfolane (TMS) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) was evaluated and tested in an
aprotic lithium–air battery. The physical and chemical characterizations
showed that the mixed electrolyte exhibited a relatively low viscosity,
high ionic conductivity and oxygen solubility, and good stability.
In addition, it was found
that lithium–air batteries with an optimized electrolyte composition
(DMA/TMS = 20:80, % v/v) showed a better cycle life and lower charge
overpotential as compared to those with electrolytes with a single
solvent, either DMA or TMS.

1 Introduction
The increase in the energy
demand as a result of the rapid development
of electronic devices and electric vehicles has motivated efforts
to develop new energy-storage devices. Aprotic lithium–air
batteries are gaining increasing attention due to their ultrahigh
specific energies, which are almost 5–10 times those of advanced
Li-ion batteries.1,2 However, electrolyte degradation
during the lithium–air battery cycling process hampers its
practical application and commercialization.3 Thus, developing a stable electrolyte is the key to improving current
rechargeable aprotic lithium–air batteries.4−6

At present,
a variety of aprotic electrolyte solvents, such as
carbonates, ethers, ionic liquids, amides, and sulfones, have been
proposed and evaluated for aprotic lithium–air batteries. Early
research has shown that carbonate electrolytes were unstable toward
O2•– and easily decomposed in
the charge and discharge processes.7−9 Although ether electrolytes
are relatively stable toward O2•–, they are easily autoxidized in an oxygen-enriched environment,
accompanied by a series of by-products.10−12 Ionic liquids are quite
stable, but their oxygen solubility is lower than that of organic
electrolytes.13−15 Although straight-chain
alkyl amides, such as N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMA), showed superior stability in the O2-containing cathode
as compared with organic carbonates and glymes and the ionic conductivity
of DMA was higher than that of other common electrolytes because of
its low viscosity, it was difficult for these solvents to form a stable
solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium anode.11,16−18 To alleviate the reaction between DMA and the lithium
anode, Walker et al.18 introduced lithium
nitrate salt (LiNO3) to stabilize the SEI, and the Li–O2 battery utilizing a 1.0 M LiNO3/DMA electrolyte
was able to run at 0.1 mA/cm2 for over 80 cycles, with
a low overpotential (<10 mV) and a good capacity of retention.
Sulfones, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sulfolane (TMS), are
another type of electrolyte previously investigated in Li–air
batteries. TMS possesses a low toxicity, low vapor pressure (27 °C,
1.24 × 10–5 bar), and a wide electrochemical
window. Its five-membered ring structure makes it superior to the
other solvents in terms of chemical and thermal stabilities.19−21 Our group22 reported that the capacity retention of a Li–air
battery containing a TMS-based electrolyte was better than that of
a battery containing a DMSO-based electrolyte during discharge/charge
cycling. Through optimizing the primary materials in Li–air
batteries based on a TMS electrolyte, the Li–air battery was
able to exhibit a cycle life as high as 800 cycles, with a specific
capacity of 1000 mA h g–1, and an average energy
efficiency of 74.72% was obtained.23 Unfortunately,
TMS easily exists in the solid state at room temperature because its
melting point is 28.4 °C, and its viscosity is substantially
higher than that of other commonly used organic solvents, resulting
in poor migration of lithium ions in the electrolyte.

To improve
the ionic conductivity and stability of electrolytes
for lithium–air batteries, researchers have tried to utilize
the advantages of different solvents and have prepared electrolytes
by mixing two or more kinds of solvents.24−27 Cecchetto et
al.,25 who mixed an ionic liquid and organic
electrolyte, reported that the addition of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) could improve the conductivity
of Li+ in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME),
and their Li–air battery containing the mixed electrolyte showed
a lower charge overpotential than that of the lithium–air cell
with only the TEGDME solvent. Herranz et al.26 and Ferrari et al.27 also found that
both the ionic conductivity and the electrochemical stability of the
hybrid electrolyte were better than those of a single electrolyte.
Combining TMS with other solvents to form a mixed electrolyte has
already been studied in lithium-ion batteries. Li et al.28 showed that compared with a lithium-ion battery
with a lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB)–ethylene carbonate/diethyl
carbonate (DEC) electrolyte, a battery with a LiBOB–TMS/DEC
electrolyte exhibited a higher discharge plateau and a better cycle
performance. In addition to experimental studies, simulation results
from molecular dynamics simulations also have been used to demonstrate
that TMS plays a major role in improving the stability of the mixed
electrolyte.29

Inspired by previous
works on mixed electrolytes, this work combined
the high stability of TMS and high ionic conductivity of DMA to form
a mixed electrolyte for a lithium–air battery. The physical
and chemical properties, including the electrochemical window, viscosity,
conductivity, and oxygen solubility, of the mixed electrolyte were
tested and analyzed systematically. By optimizing the composition
ratio of TMS and DMA, it was found that Li–air batteries with
an optimized mixed electrolyte showed a better cycle life and lower
charge overpotential as compared to those with a single solvent, that
is, either DMA or TMS.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the DMA/TMS Mixed Electrolyte
As
shown in Figure 1a,
the LiTFSI–TMS electrolyte started to undergo oxidation
at ∼6 V and it started to undergo reduction at ∼1 V,
resulting in a stability window of ∼5 V. After adding DMA,
the electrochemical windows of the two DMA/TMS mixed electrolytes
were both over 4 V versus those for Li/Li+. More importantly,
it is found that the DMA/TMS mixed electrolytes are quite stable,
not undergoing oxidation and reduction, in the potential range of
2–5 V versus Li/Li+, indicating their high stability
in the operating potentials of the lithium–air battery.

Figure 1 (a) Electrochemical
stability window of LiTFSI–TMS/20:80
DMA–TMS/50:50 DMA–TMS/DMA, which were tested in the
three-electrode electrochemical cell, with a glassy carbon electrode
as the working electrode (WE), a Pt electrode as the counter electrode
(CE), and an anhydrous Ag–Ag+ electrode as the reference
electrode (RE); (b) viscosity as a function of temperature (in a range
of 4–44 °C); and (c) ionic conductivity and (d) oxygen
solubility of the DMA/TMS electrolytes.

As seen from Figure 1b, the viscosity of the electrolytes generally increases after
the
addition of the lithium salts, and the viscosity of the mixed electrolytes
decreases with an increase in the DMA content. For example, the viscosity
decreases from 10.27 to 3.98 mPa s at 28 °C when TMS is mixed
with 20% DMA. In addition, it is seen that the viscosity of the mixed
electrolyte is less influenced by temperature as compared to that
of pure TMS or TMS containing lithium salts. These results suggest
that the addition of DMA, with a low viscosity, can effectively reduce
the viscosity of TMS, which is beneficial for increasing the mobility
of lithium ions.

Figure 1c shows
the ionic conductivities of mixed electrolytes with various DMA contents.
It can be found that the ionic conductivities of the mixed electrolytes
with 20% DMA and 50% DMA are, respectively, 50 and 140% higher than
those of TMS at 28 °C. These data indicate that the introduction
of DMA into TMS indeed increases the lithium conductivity of the mixed
electrolyte, which is in a good agreement with the results of viscosity
measurements.

High oxygen solubility is another requirement
for the electrolyte
used in a lithium–air battery because most of its cathode is
flooded with electrolyte and thus oxygen has to dissolve in the electrolyte
to react with lithium ions. The oxygen solubilities of the mixed electrolytes
at 28 °C are shown in Figure 1d. It can be found that the oxygen solubility increased
with an increase in DMA; the oxygen solubility increases from 7.09
to 7.56 mg L–1 with an increase in the DMA content
from 0 to 50%. Hence, adding DMA into TMS slightly increases the oxygen
solubility, although its improvement is less pronounced than that
observed in the viscosity and ionic conductivity.

2.2 Study of the Stability of DMA and TMS toward
Discharge Products
Figure 2 shows gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) graphs of solvents based on changes in the solvent
chromatographic peaks in acetonitrile (AN) after reacting with KO2 or Li2O2 for 1 week. As seen from Figure 2a,b, respectively,
the characteristic peak of DMA or TMS dominates the whole screening
process, which shows their high stability toward KO2 or
Li2O2. However, as a stable carrier solvent
widely used in GC–MS, AN still encountered nucleophilic attack
from adventitious moisture, as described.16 The acetamide chromatographic peak was detected after AN was treated
with KO2 or Li2O2, implying solvent
degradation of AN. AN dimers, AN trimers, or other species from AN
degradation may also exist,16 although
GC–MS is unable to detect them in trace amounts. As a result,
it can be seen from Figure 2c,d that the peak areas of DMA and TMS after reacting with
KO2 or Li2O2 are slightly larger
than their pristine peak areas, which indicates a slight increase
in the relative concentration of DMA or TMS in solvent AN. In summary,
GC–MS analysis shows that acetamide is the only degradation
product from AN, and no other product was detected when DMA and TMS
were treated with KO2 or Li2O2. This
further confirms that no obvious reaction take place between the solvent
and oxygen species. Both DMA and TMS are relatively stable solvents
toward KO2 or Li2O2 under normal
circumstances.

Figure 2 Full GC–MS graphs of solvents based on changes
in the solvent
chromatographic peaks in AN after reacting with (a) KO2 and (b) Li2O2 for 1 week, and amplified characteristic
examples of the GC–MS screening: (c) DMA and (d) TMS.

However, this stability investigation
toward KO2 or Li2O2 is isolated from
the battery. The oxidative decomposition of DMA following the discharging
or charging process in a Li–air battery was proven by others
to produce acetamide, Li2CO3, HCO2Li, or other species.30 Besides, the corrosion
reaction with the Li anode was also undoubtedly verified.16−18 These factors above would be the mortal obstacles for DMA to be
a single stable solvent in a Li–air battery.

2.3 Electrochemical Test of the DMA/TMS Mixed
Electrolyte
2.3.1 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
Characterization
Figure 3 shows the
CV results attained with a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 and a potential range of 1.82–4.40 V for various electrolytes,
including DMA, TMS, and DMA/TMS, with mixing ratios of 20:80 and 50:50.
It is seen that for all electrolytes there is one reduction peak at
about 2.3 V and one oxidation peak between 3.2 and 3.5 V, which can
be assigned to the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution
reaction (OER), respectively. More importantly, it is found that the
addition of DMA to the TMS electrolyte results in improvements in
the peak current densities and onset potentials of both ORR and OER,
which might have arisen from increases in the conductivity of lithium
ions and solubility of the reaction products (or intermediates). In
addition, it is found that for the DMA electrolyte the peak area of
ORR is much larger than that of OER. One possible reason for this
might be that some soluble ORR products diffuse into the bulk DMA
solution and hence would be absent from the OER during the forward
scan, resulting in less charge transfer involved in the OER, consistent
with the findings of the microelectrode study.31 On the basis of the CV results, it is inferred that compared
with TMS, DMA has a better ability to dissolve the reduction products
and that the addition of DMA could promote the ORR and OER.

the electrolytes containing 0.1 M LiTFSI in TMS/20:80
DMA–TMS/50:50 DMA–TMS /DMA at a scan rate of 100 mV
s–1 in a potential range of 1.82–4.40 V,
which were tested in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a
glassy carbon electrode as the WE, a Pt electrode as the CE, and an
anhydrous Ag–Ag+ electrode as the RE.

2.3.2 Galvanostatic Charge/Discharge
Test
Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests are used to evaluate
the cycle
performance of Li–air batteries containing four kinds of electrolytes.
As shown in Figure 4a,b, no obvious difference in the discharge plateau is observed among
the four kinds of electrolytes at the first and tenth cycles, whereas
the battery containing the DMA electrolyte exhibits a much smaller
charge plateau than that of the other three electrolytes. At the 50th
cycle, however, the Li–air battery using DMA as the electrolyte
shows serious polarization, with high discharge and charge overpotentials,
likely due to the severe reaction between DMA and the lithium anode.
Starting from the 50th cycle, the average charge potentials of the
cells with mixed DMA/TMS electrolytes are much lower than those with
the TMS electrolyte, as shown in Figure 4c,d. This may because the mixed electrolyte
has a higher ionic conductivity and larger solubility of reaction
products as compared with the TMS electrolyte.

Figure 4 Galvanostatic charge/discharge
curves of Li–air batteries
containing 1 M LiTFSI in TMS/20:80 DMA–TMS/50:50 DMA–TMS/DMA
at the (a) 1st, (b) 10th, (c) 50th, and (d) 100th cycles; the batteries
with Ketjen Black (KB) carbon cathodes were tested at a current density
of 0.3 mA cm–2 (1.77 A g–1), with
a fixed specific capacity of 1000 mA h g–1.

To better compare the cyclic performances
with various electrolytes,
the terminal voltages, namely, the final voltages during charge or
discharge, are presented in Figure 5. It can be seen that with cutoff voltages of 2.0 and
5.0 V the lithium–air batteries can undergo 50, 140, 200, and
200 cycles, respectively, on using DMA, DMA/TMS (50:50), DMA/TMS (20:80),
and TMS as electrolytes. Although the cycle life of the cell with
TMS is relatively high, its polarization, especially the charge voltage,
is quite high and rises to 5.0 V only after 50 cycles, representing
substantially low energy efficiency. As evident in Figure 5, the charge/discharge overvoltages
can be lowered by adding 20% DMA to TMS, with the high cycle life
still maintained, demonstrating the beneficial effect of DMA as an
additive to TMS. However, it should be mentioned that the positive
effect of adding DMA will be inevitably counteracted by its instability
toward lithium metal when the content of DMA is too high. It can be
also found that the overpotential of DMA/TMS (50:50) is higher than
that of DMA/TMS (20:80) because adding too much DMA would cause more
serious corrosion of the lithium anode. In particular, the discharge
and charge voltages of the battery with only the DMA electrolyte reach
2.0 and 5.0 V, respectively, only after 50 cycles. However, it is
undeniable that a high polarization (>2 V) of the battery is still
observed after optimizing the electrolyte. This is because pure carbon
cathodes were used in the batteries without any addition of catalyst,
and carbon could be reacted with the discharge product of Li2O2 to generate the by-product Li2CO3, which caused great cathode passivation.32 Therefore, besides electrolyte
optimization, the development of a carbon-free cathode also deserves
significant attention to aid in overcoming the problem of serious
polarization.

containing
1 M LiTFSI in TMS/20:80 DMA–TMS/50:50 DMA–TMS/DMA during
200 cycles; the batteries with KB carbon cathodes were tested at a
current density of 0.3 mA cm–2 (1.77 A g–1), with a fixed specific capacity of 1000 mA h g–1.

3 Conclusions
Instability of the electrolyte and the high overpotential during
cycling are two challenging problems with regard to lithium–air
batteries. Utilizing the synergistic effect
of DMA and TMS, a binary mixed electrolyte with a high stability and
low ionic resistivity was designed and tested in lithium–air
batteries. GC–MS results confirmed that both DMA and TMS are
relatively stable solvents toward oxygen species under normal circumstances.
Physical and electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the
ionic conductivity of the mixed electrolyte was higher than that of
TMS and the OER onset potential of the mixed electrolytes was lower
than that of TMS. Moreover, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests showed
that lithium–air cells with the mixed electrolyte (DMA–TMS
= 20:80, % v/v) exhibited the best cycle life and lowest overpotential,
implying the effectiveness of the mixed electrolyte.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of the Electrolyte
and Cell Assembly
DMA/TMS electrolytes were prepared inside
an Ar-filled glovebox
by dissolving 1 M dried LiTFSI (99% or higher; Aladdin) salt in 1
L of a mixture of TMS (99.00% or higher; Aladdin) and DMA (99.00%
or higher; Aldrich) solvents in different volume ratios. The composition
ratios of the DMA/TMS electrolytes are shown in Table 1; lithium salts were dissolved in the solvent
completely on a magnetic stirrer.

DMA/TMS Electrolytes

In this work, a homemade
2032 coin-type cell with multiple Φ1 mm holes on the cathode
cap was used for assembling the lithium–air batteries. For
preparing the cathode slurry, a mixture of KB carbon (EC600JD; Shanghai
Tengmin) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as binder, in a weight
ratio of 9:1, using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the
solvent, was stirred for 3 h before use. Then, the slurry was pasted
on a carbon paper (HCP120; Shanghai Hesen Electric) and dried at 80
°C overnight. The mass loading (KB and PVDF) of the cathode (Φ1.5
mm) was about 0.3 mg (0.17 mg cm–2). The as-prepared
cathode, together with glass fiber (17 × 1 mm; Whatman GF/D)
as a separator and a lithium disc (15 × 0.5 mm; China Energy
Lithium) as the anode, was fabricated in the Ar-filled glovebox. Four
different types of electrolytes, as listed in Table 1, with the same loading of 70 μL were
used in the present work.

4.2 Electrolyte Characterization
The
electrochemical window of the as-prepared electrolyte was analyzed
in the absence of O2 through linear scan voltammetry (LSV)
in the three-electrode electrochemical cell tests, with a scan rate
of 1 mV s–1 and a potential range of −3 to
7 V. The electrochemical cell was constructed as reported by Ferrari
et al.,27 comprising a glassy carbon electrode
as the WE, a Pt electrode as the CE, and an anhydrous Ag–Ag+ electrode as the RE. Four solvents, as listed in Table 1, were tested. All
solvents were bubbled with high-purity dry Ar before and during the
examinations to ensure saturation of Ar in the electrochemical cell.
The viscosity of the electrolyte at a variety of temperatures was
measured with a VT rotary viscometer (Brookfield). The oxygen solubility
of the electrolyte was determined by a portable dissolved oxygen meter
(Mettler Toledo, Switzerland), and the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes
was attained by testing on Autolab (Metrohm, Switzerland). To evaluate
the stability
of the electrolyte in the presence of ORR products (or intermediates),
lithium peroxide (Li2O2, 99% or higher; Aladdin)
was used to simulate discharge product O22– and potassium superoxide (KO2, 96.5% or higher, Aladdin)
was used to simulate O2•– rather
than LiO2 because Li+ is unstable in the presence
of O2•–. Qualitative and quantitative
analyses of the electrolytes after reacting with KO2 and
Li2O2 were carried out by GC–MS (GC–MS-QP2010;
Shimadzu). The decomposed electrolyte solution was diluted with AN
(99.9% or higher, GC grade; Sigma Aldrich), with a volume ratio of
1:1000 before the GC–MS test.

4.3 Electrochemical
Test
CV measurements
of the electrolytes
were performed in the same three-electrode electrochemical cell used
in the LSV test under an O2 atmosphere, with a scan rate
of 100 mV s–1 and a potential range of 1.82–4.40
V, on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D; CH Instruments).33 Galvanostatic charge and discharge tests of
the cells containing various electrolytes were carried out using a
battery-testing system (Land CT2001A), at a current density of 0.3
mA cm–2 (1.77 A g–1), with a fixed
specific capacity of 1000 mA h g–1.
