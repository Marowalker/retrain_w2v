Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), newly emerging crystalline
and porous materials, have been widely studied in many fields because
of their unique periodic porous structures, high surface area, and
strong interlayer π–π interaction when they are
formed into a layered structure. Among the various types of COFs,
highly oriented COF thin films with a layered structure have received
great attention as one of the most promising organic-based two-dimensional
(2D) materials due to their modifiability, flexibility, and multifunctional
properties. In this mini-review, we aim to provide information on
recent advances in highly oriented 2D COF thin film, which have one
molecular thickness level to tens of nanometers. We first discuss
the preparation of high-quality 2D COF thin films in terms of interfacial
synthesis and exfoliation methods, which are representative methods
for bottom-up and top-down approaches, respectively. Also, we summarize
the applications of 2D COF thin film focusing on semiconducting devices,
membranes, and highly sensitive and selective sensors.

1 Introduction
Covalent organic frameworks
(COFs) formed by chemical linkages
through strong covalent bonds of light atoms such as carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen have been widely studied as new organic robust two-dimensional
(2D) or three-dimensional (3D) crystalline polymers since their first
report in 2005.1 Due to their uniform porous
structure and high thermal/chemical stability, they have been investigated
as potential materials of various applications including energy storage,
optoelectronic devices, gas adsorption, chemical catalysts, and sensors.2 Especially, 2D COFs, being regarded as a new
source of layered materials, have received great attention because
they can be obtained in not only highly oriented multilayers but also
one molecular level thick layer. Different from conventional atomic-level
2D materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
or hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), molecule-based
2D COFs can be obtained as desired crystal structures with specific
functional groups using various types of precursors. Such structure
and property variation of 2D COFs facilitates control of optical and
electrical properties as well as other physical properties, which
is a big advantage in their potential applications. However, randomly
oriented 2D COFs in powder form obtained by conventional solution-phase
synthesis methods such as solvothermal,1 microwave,3 and sonochemical4 methods are not suitable for confirming intrinsic
properties of 2D COFs due to the irregular orientation and numerous
grain boundaries caused by small particle size. Therefore, to take
advantage of the interesting properties of 2D COF films, highly oriented
and well-defined films become needed. To date, various approaches
have been reported, and this mini-review focuses mainly on two representative
synthesis methods: (1) interfacial growth on a liquid surface and
(2) exfoliation method using external forces. Also, we summarize the
investigated applications of 2D COF thin films that show outstanding
semiconducting, separating, and sensing properties according to their
functional groups, pore sizes, and crystal structures.

2 Synthesis of Highly Oriented 2D COF Films
Synthesis of COFs is mainly based on the dynamic covalent chemistry
(DCvC) which is one of the efficient synthetic strategies used to
obtain a thermodynamically stable structure through reversible covalent
bond formation. Through chemical reactions of various precursors having
specific functional groups and highly symmetric structure, various
types of COFs can be synthesized. To obtain a high-quality COF successively,
covalent bond formation has to occur reversibly, which enables an
“error-checking” or “self-healing” process,
resulting in a thermodynamically stable and highly symmetrical crystal
structure. Among the various reactions used in DCvC for COF formation,
two representative dehydration reactions have been widely used. The
first is the dehydration reaction of boronic acid and catechol, and
the other is the Schiff base reaction of aldehyde and amine functional
groups. Based on these reactions, various synthetic approaches for
2D COF films have been developed as follows.

2-1 Interfacial Synthesis
Liquid surfaces
are one of the most uniform and flat surfaces suitable for obtaining
molecule-based 2D materials. Different from conventional 2D crystalline
materials synthesized at the gas–solid interface at high temperature,
molecular precursors for COFs are less mobile on a solid substrate
and easily decomposed at high temperatures. Therefore, liquid surfaces
that can increase the mobility of molecular precursors and induce
2D-confined reaction at mild synthetic conditions would be a more
appropriate substrate for the synthesis of 2D COF films.

In
2006, Zhang and co-workers synthesized an imine-linked monolayer COF
at the air/water interface using a Langmuir–Blodgett trough
method that has been widely used to obtain various monolayer films
by monitoring the surface tension of liquid layers.5 They used a Schiff base formation reaction between terephthaldehyde
and 1,3,5-trihexyl-2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene to obtain the
imine-linked target COF (Figure 1a). The resulting film shows sizes in the range of
several hundreds of micrometers with a thickness of about 0.7 nm and
uniform surface (Figure 1b and c). They characterized the chemical structure of the resulting
film by tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), which shows the formation
of a conjugated system through the newly observed C=N stretching
vibration bands. Also, Feng et al. reported wafer-sized polyimine-based
2D COFs (2DPs) having multifunctional properties6 (Figure 1d). They synthesized two types of 2DP films through Schiff base polycondensation
reaction at the air–water interface using a Langmuir–Blodgett
method. They confirmed that the resulting 4 inch wafer-scale films
had a homogeneous crystalline structure with a high Young’s
modulus of 267 ± 30 GPa that is comparable with graphene. (Figure 1e and f). In addition,
the obtained 2DPs were examined as a thin-film transistor exhibiting
mobility of 1.3 × 10–6 cm2 V–1 S–1, and especially, the cobalt-containing
2D films show outstanding electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution characteristics.
Recently, our group reported a light-promoted synthesis of scalable
2D COF film on the surface of polarity-controlled precursor solution.7 We focused on the simple and rapid synthesis
of the target COF as a 2D structure without using complex instruments
other than the ordinary apparatus for wet chemistry and elucidated
the importance of the solvent polarity of the reaction precursor solution.
The highly uniform layer of the precursor solution on the water surface
makes it possible to control not only the size of the resulting 2D
COF film but also the number of layers at a level of single molecular
thickness with a 4 in. wafer size.

Also, the liquid–liquid interfacial growth
uses immiscible
liquid interfaces that enable spatially confined growth of COFs. In
general, water is used as one liquid layer, and nonpolar solvents
such as chloroform, toluene, or hexane are used as the other layer.
Banerjee and co-workers synthesized four types of free-standing 2D
COF films (Tp-Tta, Tp-Ttba, Tp-Bpy, and Tp-Azo) at the liquid–liquid
interface through Schiff base reactions8 (Figure 2a). To control
the growth rate of reaction, which affects the crystallinity of product,
they used a salt-mediated technique using amine-p-toluene sulfornic acid (PTSA) salts that interact with the amine
precursor and slow down the diffusion rate (Figure 2b). They used the dichloromethane–water
interface as a reaction substrate, which dissolves 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol
(Tp) and four different types of PTSA–amine precursors, respectively.
After 72 h, free-standing and transparent thin films having uniform
surface and crystalline structure with a thickness in the range from
∼50 to 90 nm were obtained (Figure 2c). More recently, Li et al. synthesized
two different 2D COF films, 2DCCOF1 and 2DCCOF2, both of which show
highly crystalline structures and have flat and uniform surfaces.9 Different from the conventional synthesis reactions
of COFs, they used Suzuki reaction between boronic groups and highly
symmetric halogen-containing precursors for the sp2–sp2 carbon bond formation. For the reaction, a precursor solution
dissolved in toluene with Pd(PPh3)4 was dropped
on the K2CO3 aqueous solution and stored in
a refrigerator for a month. The resulting free-standing films show
clear electron diffraction patterns that are well-matched with the
simulated results. Using the geometrical advantage of large-scale
and uniform 2D materials, they fabricated 2DCCOF1-based FET devices.
Due to the 2D extended conjugated structure, the resulting device
shows a carrier mobility of 3.2 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s, which is one of the highest values
in the reported 2D COF films. Also, they confirmed the hydrogen evolution
reaction activity of 2DCCOF1 film, which shows an overpotential of
541 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and Tafel
slope of 130 mV/decade.

2-2 Exfoliation/Delamination Method
Because
layered materials interact through strong covalent bonds on their
planes, while held together by weak van der Waals interactions along
the out-of-plane direction, they can be isolated into thin 2D films.
Similar to other conventional layered materials, there have been efforts
to isolate COF thin films from their bulks by breaking the π–π
interaction between layers by mechanical force, sonication in various
solvents, and chemical intercalation. Although the small grain size
of the parent COF powder limits the large-scale formation of 2D COF
films, it is a simple, efficient, intuitive method to obtain mono-
or multilayer 2D COF films. In 2013, Banerjee and co-workers synthesized
seven different bulk crystalline COF powders, TpPa-2, TpPa-NO2, TpBD-Me2, TpPa-F4, TpPa-1, TpBD-(OMe)2, and TpBD, that show chemical stability in aqueous, acidic,
and basic environments.10 After grinding
the as-synthesized COFs in a mortar with a small amount of methanol
for 30 min, they could obtain 2D COF thin films with thickness of
a few nanometers (Figure 3a). The resulting 2D COF films show identical chemical bonds
and crystal structures with bulk COFs, which means mild mechanical
force efficiently delaminates the COF layers without changes or degradations
of chemical bonds and crystal structures. Besides the mechanical delamination
method, solvent-assisted exfoliation is one of the simplest and most
widely used methods to obtain desired thin-film materials. However,
low structural and chemical stability of COFs in various solvents
brought difficulties in applying to solvent-assisted exfoliation method.
Therefore, Dichtel and co-workers used a newly synthesized acyl-hydrazone
containing COF-43 that shows improved chemical/thermal stability and
has weak interlayer interactions that are favorable for exfoliation
in solution11 (Figure 3b). They confirmed that the crystal structure
and chemical bonds of COF-43 are well-preserved in THF, CHCl3, PhMe, and MeOH, while the crystallinity is lost in dioxane, H2O, and DMF due to hydrolysis. After soaking and sonicating
bulk COF-43 powder in various solvents for 2 h, the dispersed COF-43
layers were obtained. The resulting COF-43 films have thickness ranging
from 3.3 Å to several tens of nanometers according to the solvents,
and the obtained films dispersed in dioxane and THF show high crystallinity
especially when dissolved in dioxane or THF (Figure 3c and d).

More recently, Banerjee et al. reported a new strategy
for obtaining
anthracene-containing 2D covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), DaTp-CONs,
using a postmodification-derived chemical exfoliation method.12 The [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of N-hexylmaleimide molecules and anthracenes in DaTp disturbs
the π–π interaction of DaTp layers and facilitates
their separation (Figure 4a). The postmodified DaTp (DaTp-CON) has almost identical
vibrational bands with original DaTp, and additional C–H vibrational
bands are newly observed at 2937 and 2857 cm–1 in
IR spectra. Different from the morphology of DaTp having a ribbon-like
aggregated morphology, after cycloaddition reaction, DaTp-CON shows
a thin-sheet-like morphology having a width, length, and thickness
of 200, 500, and 17 nm, respectively. Also, they used not only exfoliation
methods through additional chemical reactions but also the interfacial
method to obtain thin films as large-scale and free-standing structures
with tunable thickness. A suspension of DaTp-CONs dissolved in dichloromethane
(DCM) was slowly added on the water surface, and after 60 s, transparent,
flat, and robust DaTp-CON films having uniform thickness were successfully
obtained (Figure 4b
and c).

film produced from DCM suspensions with high concentrations of DaTp-CON.

2-3 Other Methods
Highly oriented COF
films have also been obtained on conventional 2D materials. The atomically
flat and ordered atomic structure of the conventional 2D materials
allows oriented assembly of organic molecules. In 2011, Dichtel and
co-workers synthesized COF-5, the first COF reported by O.M. Yaghi,
on a large-scale graphene.13 They used
a conventional solvothermal method for condensation reaction of 1,4-phenyl-enebis(boronic
acid) (PBBA) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) in the
presence of graphene on various substrates (Cu, SiC, SiO2) in a mixture of mesitylene and dioxane. After 1 h of reaction at
90 °C, COF-5 was obtained in the form of an insoluble powder
in the reaction solution and a film on the graphene surface, respectively.
Although the thickness of the resulting films was much thicker than
the ones prepared by other synthesis methods, they exhibit vertical
alignment with a long-range order that is important for their intrinsic
electrical and optical properties. Besides graphene, another 2D material,
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), was also used as a dielectric substrate
to confirm the electronic property of COF-366 film. Wang et al. synthesized
COF-366 films on h-BN through imine-condensation reaction of tetra(p-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) and terephthaldehyde (TPA)
in the presence of exfoliated h-BN transferred to the SiO2 substrate.14 They confirmed that few-layer
(5–8 layers) COF-366 films were selectively grown on the h-BN
substrate, and the absorption edge of the films red-shifted compared
to the bulk COF-366 powder. The resulting COF-366 films on h-BN exhibit
p-type semiconducting properties with an on/off ratio of 105 and mobility of 0.015 cm2 V–1 S–1. In addition to the aforementioned synthesis methods,
other methods using solvent or precursor including solvent vapor were
reported for a simple and efficient method to obtain COF films consisting
of unoriented and polycrystalline powder with a thickness of several
micrometers.15,16

3 Various Applications of 2D COF Films
Different from bulk COF powders that have been widely studied as
gas adsorption or storage material due to their high surface area,
low density, and uniform porous structure, the applications of 2D
COF films have been mainly focused on utilizing their geometrical
advantages. Among various reported applications, we cover three representative
applications: semiconducting electronic devices, membranes, and sensors.

3-1 Application to Semiconducting Electronic Devices
Various types of COFs have been studied as potential organic-based
electronic materials due to their highly conjugated electronic structure
along the in-plane direction and the large π-orbital overlap
along the out-of-plane direction. However, bulk COF powders having
a rough surface and randomly oriented structure are not suitable for
device fabrication to confirm the intrinsic electrical properties
of target COFs. On the other hand, highly oriented and uniform 2D
COF films not only have suitable geometry for device fabrications
but also allow for structure–property correlation studies.
In 2015, Bao and co-workers reported the first field effect transistors
(FETs) of 2D COF film, polyTB, synthesized by dehydration reaction
of 2,6-dicarbaldehyde-4,8-dioctyloxybenzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene
(tapa) and tris(4-aminophenyl)amine (bdta)17 (Figure 5a). To obtain
uniform and large-scale thin COF films in intimate contact with the
dielectric layer, they reacted tapa and bdta in a covered Petri dish
in ambient conditions. After 2 days, highly reflective red films having
thickness and roughness of 1.8 and 0.2 nm, respectively, were obtained
at the solution/air interface (Figure 5b). The obtained polyTB film was transferred onto a
SiO2, and gold was deposited on top of the film for electrical
property measurements. The polyTB film transistor shows mobility of
3.0 × 10–6 cm2 V–1 S–1 and an average on/off ratio of 850 (Figure 5c). They revealed
that the relatively low mobility of the transistor than calculated
values was due to grain boundaries that cause internal defects and
loss of crystallinity during the film drying process. Recently, our
group reported a highly conjugated crystalline COF (hcc-COF) with
an aromatic extended π-conjugated structure18 (Figure 5d). We focused on the synthesis and structural analysis of hcc-COF
and studied the effect of electron delocalization on the electrical
property along the in-plane direction. We induced an efficient reversible
imine condensation reaction that was critical for reducing structural
defects while increasing grain size of the film by adding a small
amount of acid catalyst and water. The crystal structure of hcc-COF
was confirmed by the Pawley refinement process that shows highly symmetric
and extended π-conjugated microporous structure along the lateral
direction and has inclined stacking structure due to the interlayer
dipole–dipole repulsion force between nitrogen in the pyrazine
functional group. To obtain continuous and uniform hcc-COF film, we
used a polarity controlled precursor solution that enables uniform
floating of precursors on the water substrate. The resulting large-scale
and crystalline hcc-COF film shows a clean and homogeneous surface,
of which thickness is 3.8 nm that corresponds to nine layers of hcc-COF
(Figure 5e). The electrical
conductivity along the in-plane direction of hcc-COF film increased
depending on the temperature increase, and the measured conductivity
in ambient conditions was 0.40 S/m, which is one of the highest conductivity
values among not only the reported films but also undoped highly conjugated
porous polymer (Figure 5f). The electrical property along the out-of-plane direction of COFs
held together by π–π stacking and van der Waals
interactions was also confirmed by several groups in 2017. For the
oriented stacking of target COFTFPY-PPDA film, Wang
et al. reacted two symmetric precursors, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-formylphenyl)pyrene
and p-phenylenediamine, in the presence of graphene
on the Au/Cr source electrode19 (Figure 5g). After reaction
at 120 °C for 24 h, highly oriented COFTFPY-PPDA film was confirmed by X-ray scattering analysis. For the device
fabrication, 60 nm thick Au was deposited on highly oriented COFTFPY-PPDA/graphene as a drain electrode to confirm the
vertical electrical property of a COFTFPY-PPDA/graphene
hybrid structure (Figure 5h). The current density–gate voltage curve shows the
intrinsic p-type property of the COFTFPY-PPDA and
ambipolar charge carrier behavior of the COFTFPY-PPDA/graphene hybrid structure (Figure 5i). Also, Bein and co-workers confirmed the electrical
conductivities of both the in-plane and out-of-plane direction of
highly oriented benzodithiophene COF (BDT-COF) thin films.20 They confirmed that BDT-COF films showed higher
resistivity along the in-plane direction than the out-of-plane direction
due to electron barriers imposed by the boronate ester linking group.
The highly ordered structure of BDT-COF films was able to confirm
these intrinsic anisotropic electrical properties of 2D BDT-COF. Also,
the charge transport along the out-of-plane direction depends on the
thickness of BDT-COF due to transport barriers between BDT-COF. The
thickness dependence measurements show hole mobilities in the range
of 3 × 10–7 to 6 × 10–9 cm2 V–1 S–1.

3-2 Application to Membranes
Membrane
materials have been widely studied as selective barriers for molecules,
ions, or small particles for applications in various fields. Compared
with other membrane materials, COFs received special attention due
to their low density, high surface area, controllable pore size, and
crystalline structure. The development of various synthetic strategies
for highly oriented and uniform COF films facilitates their applications
for separation of organic solvents, salts, and toxic gases. Recently,
Lai and co-workers synthesized well-defined porous COF, DFP-DHP COF,
through a two-step reaction: the first step is the Schiff-base condensation
reaction of 1,3,5-triformylpholoroglucinol (TFP) and 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diamine
(DHF), and the next step is an irreversible tautomerism reaction to
form a β-ketoenamine structure to maintain the integrity of
the structure21 (Figure 6a). The surface of the resulting DFP-DHP
COF films obtained at the air–water surface using a Langmuir–Blodget
method was uniform and smooth with ca. 0.5 nm of roughness (Figure 6b). To confirm the
permeability of organic and inorganic solvents such as water, ethanol,
or hexane, DFP-DHP COF films having 15, 20, and 30 numbers of layers
(M15, M20, and M30) were transferred on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO).
Regardless of the layer number, the 2D TFP-DHF membrane shows outstanding
permeabilities for both polar and nonpolar organic solvents and high
rejection rate with a high molecular weight retention onset and molecular
weight cutoff value of 600 and 900 Da, respectively (Figure 6c and d). Also, Banerjee and
co-workers synthesized four types of COF films (Tp-Bpy, Tp-Azo, Tp-Ttba,
Tp-Tta) at the water–chloroform interface for nanofiltration
application.8 Among the four types of COFs,
Tp-Bpy and Tp-Azo films with large pore sizes (25 and 16 Å, respectively)
were used for the separation of dye molecules that are one of the
abundant impurities in the wastewater generated by dye-manufacturing
processes. Four organic dye molecules, brilliant blue-G (BB), congo
red (CR), acid fuchsin (AF), and rhodamine B (RH), were used as target
dyes, and their aqueous solutions were passed through the membrane
cell at 0.5 bar upstream pressure. The presence of dyes is confirmed
by measuring UV–vis spectra. Both Tp-Bpy and Tp-Azo films showed
high solute-rejection performance for various dyes, and especially,
Tp-Bpy and Tp-Azo films exhibited a high rejection ratio for RH as
high as 98% and 99%, respectively. Using a different rejection ratio,
selective separation of p-nitrophenol (NP) was successfully
achieved from a mixture of NP and AF. In addition, there are several
computational studies in the gas separation property of ultrathin
COF film.22 Zhong et al. reported the intrinsic
features of triazine-based COF, CTF-1, as an ideal membrane for gas
separation.23 Through systematic study
using a series of few-layered CTF-1 films for CO2 and N2 separation, they demonstrated that regulation of the membrane
size through stacking structure control was important to obtain a
highly selective membrane, and also, tuning the stacking modes of
CTF-1 film can construct a favorable microenvironment that allows
membranes with high flux and high selectivity.

rates of various dyes through the M20 membrane vs their molecular

3-3 Application to Sensors
One of the
biggest advantages of COFs than other 2D materials is their easy chemical
modification that can affect not only their intrinsic electrical and
optical properties but also reactivities with other molecules, which
allows the modulation of selectivity of sensitivity of COF sensors
to various target materials. Not only 2D COF films but also bulk 2D
and 3D COFs have outstanding high surface area like other porous materials,
which is essential for efficient sensing applications. However, randomly
oriented and aggregated powder structures not only reduce reactivity
with target molecules but also give geometrical limitation in device
fabrication for electrical and optical sensing applications. In addition,
the uniform and flat surface of highly oriented 2D structure significantly
increases area-to-volume ratios and improves sensitivity toward target
materials, while reducing the impact on grain boundaries or chemical
defects. Therefore, the 2D COF having highly oriented and uniform
film structure is essential for sensing application of COFs.

In 2015, Banerjee and co-workers synthesized two types of COFs, TpBDH
and TfpBDH, which were synthesized by the imine condensation reaction
of pyromellitic-N,N′-bisaminoimide
(BDH) and formyl-containing precursors (1,3,5-trisformylphloroglucinol
(Tp) and 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene (Tfp), respectively) (Figure 7a).24 After solvothermal synthesis of bulk TpBDH and TfpBDH powders,
they obtained covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) by dispersing and
sonicating them in isopropyl alcohol for 45–60 min. The resulting
flat and thin TpBDH and TfpBDH CONs have a uniform surface with 0.45
nm and 0.43 periodic lattice fringes, respectively, with a thickness
of several nanometers. Different from TpBDH and TpBDH–CONs
that have no photoluminescence (PL) activity due to the disturbance
of π-conjugation caused by enol-keto tautomerization, TfpBDH
and TfpBDH–CONs with extended π-conjugation structure
show intensive PL. Considering higher PL activity, they observed optical
sensing behavior of TfpBDH depending on the different nitro-aromatic
analytes: 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT),
2,6-dinitrophenol (DNP), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 2-nitrophenol
(NP) (Figure 7b and
c). Interestingly, TNP shows high PL quenching efficiency of 63% in
dispersed TfpBDH–CON solution due to photoinduced charge transfer
between the TNP anions and protonated TfpBDH–CONs. On the other
hand, bulk TfpBDH–CONs that drop-dried on a solid substrate
show highly enhanced PL intensity caused by proton transfer from TNPs
to basic nitrogen atoms of the imine bond (Figure 7d and f). The simultaneous turn-on/-off sensing
properties of 2D COFs provide potential sensing applications of various
2D COFs in bulk and dispersed states. Also, Zhang et al. used the
COF as a novel fluorescence sensing material for highly selective
and sensitive DNA detection.25 They synthesized
crystalline bulk TPA-COF powder using solvothermal reaction of tris(4-aminophenyl)amine
(TAPA) and tris(4-formylphenyl)amine (TFPA). After synthesis, products
were exfoliated by the solvent-assisted liquid exfoliation method
for obtaining highly uniform and crystalline 2D TPA-COF nanosheets
(NSs) with thickness of 3.4–3.8 nm (Figure 8a–c). For DNA sensing, they used two
types of hairpin DNA probes, H1 (labeled with a fluorescent dye) and
pure H2. When H1 and H2 are adsorbed on the COF NSs, the fluorescence
of H1 is rapidly quenched through π–π stacking
interactions. However, H1 and H2 make a hybridization chain in the
presence of target DNA (T), resulting in the recovery of fluorescence
(Figure 8d). The quenching
efficiency is 90% in 15 min, and fluorescence is greatly retained
even in the presence of TPA-COF NSs, which is comparable with or even
better than other 2D material-based DNA sensors (Figure 8e). Last year, our group synthesized
uniform and layer-number controllable polyimine-based COF (π-COF)
film at the water surface using polarity-controlled precursor solutions
for uniform floating of precursors7 (Figure 9a and b). For device
fabrication to obtain flat and large-scale π-COF films, metal
electrodes were deposited on top of the surface using a shadow mask.
Although the fabricated π-COF film devices show relatively low
electrical conductance (2 × 10–9 S), the drain
current drastically increases in the presence of water vapor from
400 nA to 100 μA at Vds of 20 V
due to water capture through hydrogen bonding between the imine functional
group and water molecules (Figure 9c). Our result is the first report of a COF 2D film
as an electrical chemisorption sensor. These interesting sensing properties
of various COFs suggest the potential applications as a highly sensitive
sensor material.

4 Conclusion
In this review, we introduced
the efficient synthesis methods and
important applications of highly oriented and uniform 2D COFs investigated
so far. The development of new synthesis methods of 2D COFs that show
outstanding chemical stability, structural regularity, and high crystallinity
over a large area extended their potential for various applications.
However, there are still many issues that have to be solved. For example,
the absence of a critical tool for identifying defect sites and grain
boundaries prevents understanding the intrinsic properties and growth
mechanism of various 2D COFs. If we identify accurate growth mechanisms
and optimize the synthetic conditions of 2D COFs, not only high-quality
but also scale-up production will be realized.

Synthesizing
COFs is like assembling LEGO at the molecular level.
Like atoms gather together to form molecules, many organic molecules
become COFs in different structures with different properties through
fundamental chemical reactions. In the near future, we believe that
2D COFs could be the leading and representative organic 2D materials
with multifunctional properties through the development of specific
building blocks having desired properties.
