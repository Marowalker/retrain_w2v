An ecofriendly, magnetically retrievable
amine-functionalized SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst
was successfully synthesized
and affirmed by several physicochemical characterization tools, such
as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), vibrating
sample magnetometry (VSM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),
and powder X-ray diffraction. Thereafter, the catalytic performance
of this environmentally benign NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 catalyst was investigated in the one-pot multicomponent
synthesis of 2-amino-4H-benzo[b]pyran
derivatives. The reaction was simply achieved by grinding of various
substituted aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and malononitrile at room
temperature under solvent and waste-free conditions with excellent
yields and high purity. Moreover, the developed catalyst not only
possesses immense potential to accelerate the synthesis of bioactive
pyran derivatives but also exhibits several remarkable attributes
like broad functional group tolerance, durability, improved yield,
reusability, and recyclability. Besides, various other fascinating
advantages of this protocol are milder reaction conditions, cost effectiveness,
short reaction time, and simple work up procedures.

Introduction
Environmentally
benign methods like high efficiency, selectivity,
high yield, and simple reaction procedures have become the most important
targets to achieve in the field of organic chemistry. To achieve these,
multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have recently emerged as the most
powerful tools in the synthesis of organic compounds and chemotherapeutic
drugs by forming carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom
bonds using a one-pot procedure.1,2 In MCRs, a number of
different starting materials (for example three or more components)
are allowed to react to give a desired product using one-pot synthesis.3,4 These reactions have great impact in organic synthesis as they provide
various advantages, such as less reaction time, simple separation
steps, and cost effectiveness, which eventually provides better yield
as compared with multistep synthesis.5 In
addition to this, the solvent-free approach is also a widely acceptable
greener methodology especially in terms of an economic as well as
synthetic point of view, as use of organic solvents has several disadvantages,
including toxicity, a tedious work-up procedure in synthesis, and
expense.6,7 Further, such reactions are performed under
environment-friendly conditions without using strong acids like HCl,
H2SO4, etc. which can in turn cause corrosion,
safety issues, and pollution problems. In this context, one-pot mechanochemical
reactions, i.e., reactions attained by grinding the reactants altogether
using a mortar and pestle (also known as “grindstone chemistry”)
offers significant advantages such as no column chromatography, no
tedious work up, cost effectiveness, and less reaction time over multistep
reactions.8a

Nowadays, nanoparticles
are considered as the building blocks for
various nanotechnology applications, which frequently display unique
size-dependent physical and chemical properties.8b Sometimes, nanoparticles cannot be used directly as they
are associated with certain limitations, such as toxicity, hydrophobicity,
unnecessary interactions, etc. These problems can often be overcome
by introducing an intermediate (layers or shells). Therefore, derivatization
for any application of nanoparticles is prerequisite, which can be
either by stabilizing the functional cores or by activating the surfaces.
In this context, silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles have attracted
great attention owing to their various remarkable properties, such
as ease of synthesis, functionalization, thermal stability, low toxicity,
and effortless separation from the reaction medium using an external
magnet. Silica is considered as one of the most flexible and robust
surfaces known,8c which is associated with
various advantages, such as it is chemically inert and optically transparent
(so that chemical reactions can be monitored spectroscopically). Hence,
the modified silica shell increases the mechanical stability as well
as enables functionalization and thus has the potential for many new
applications. Keeping this background in mind, we proposed an ecofriendly
grinding technology for the synthesis of 2-amino-4H-benzo[b]pyrans using amine-functionalized silica
magnetic nanoparticles (NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4). In the last few years, tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyrans and its analogues have attracted great attention as they
are part and parcel of various heterocyclic natural products and drugs
that exhibit anticoagulant, antitumor, anticancer, antiallergic, diuretic,
and antibacterial properties.9−13 Additionally, they exhibit a broad spectrum of applications as cognitive
enhancers that are used for treating neurodegenerative diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and Down’s syndrome.14,15 4H-benzo[b]pyran or chromene scaffold
is found in several drugs that are pharmacologically active, for example,
2,7,8-triamino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (A),16 2-amino-4-(3-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (B),17 ethyl-2-(2-amino-6-bromo-3-cyano-4H-chromene-4-yl)-2-cyanoacetate
(C),10 2-amino-7-(dimethylamino)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-yl)-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (D),18 2-amino-4-(furan-3-yl)-6,6-dimethyl-5-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (E),19 and 2-amino-6,6-dimethyl-5-oxo-4-(thiophen-3-yl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (F)19 shown in Figure 1. Because of the versatile utilization of substituted pyran analogues
in medicinal chemistry, there is an upsurge to develop simple, inexpensive,
and high yielding methods for their synthesis.20,21 Our research group is focused on the design and synthesis of newer
antimalarial drugs, single-crystal structure analysis, and catalysis
of small molecules.22−24 In continuation to this search, we had synthesized
new and efficient economically benign catalyst NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 to optimize its efficacy in the
synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyrans. Adopting the
fascinating advantages of MCRs, herein, we wish to report a library
of 2-amino-4H-benzopyran derivatives via condensation
of the three-component (aromatic aldehyde, malononitrile, and dimedone)
one-pot reaction catalyzed by amine-functionalized silica magnetic
nanoparticles (ASMNPs). A large number of derivatives can be rapidly
synthesized in high yield using the grinding multicomponent solvent-free
technique at room temperature.

benzo[b]pyran scaffold.

Results
and Discussion
Catalyst Preparation
The procedure
for synthesis of
Fe3O4 and SMNPs is provided in the Experimental Section. To obtain the amine-functionalized
SiO2@Fe3O4, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) (0.5 mL) was slowly added to 100 mL of the ethanolic solution
of SMNPs (0.1 g) and then the resulting mixture was allowed to stir
at room temperature for 24 h.25 The resulting
NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 (ASMNPs)
was separated magnetically and washed several times with ethanol to
remove any unreacted silylating agent and dried under vacuum. The
overall synthesis is depicted in Figure 2.

NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 MNPs.

Catalytic Activity Test
The catalytic
efficiency of
NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 (ASMNPs)
was investigated in the synthesis of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran analogues, and the reaction conditions were optimized in terms
of the amount of catalyst, reaction time, and yields. A model reaction
between 4-bromobenzaldehyde, malononitrile, and dimedone was monitored
for optimization of various parameters, as demonstrated in Table 1.

Effect of the Amount of Catalyst and Solvent
The effect
of the amount of catalyst was observed on the selected model reaction
and summarized in Figure 3. It is evident from Figure 3 that there was no product formation in the absence
of catalyst NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4. Further, there was an increase in percentage yield of the product
on increasing the amount of catalyst by 2–10 mg. On further
increasing the amount of the catalyst by 15 mg, there was no such
augmentation in the yield. Moreover, it was also observed that on
varying the solvents such as water, ethanol, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), there was no such hike
in the percentage yield of the product, which eventually proves that
the catalyst plays a crucial role in ensuring a very efficient reaction
time period with excellent yields.

between aromatic aldehyde, malononitrile, and dimedone.

Quantification of the Active Amine Sites
Quantification
of the number of amine sites on the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles
can be easily analyzed by the simple acid–base back titration
method, as reported elsewhere.26 In brief,
the amine-modified silica nanoparticles (10 mg) were dispersed in
1.0 mM HCl (20 mL) and the contents were stirred for around 45 min.
Later on, nanoparticles were separated with the help of centrifugation
at 15 000 rpm for 15 min and 10 mL of the supernatant was collected
to be titrated with the standardized 1.0 mM NaOH solution, till neutralization
point is reached by taking phenolphthalein as an indicator to evaluate
the total active amine sites. The number of amine sites calculated
with the help of acid–base back titration was found to be 2.62
ea/nm2.

Green Chemistry Metrics
Next, we
examined the green
chemistry parameters for compound 4c. Table 2 outlines several metrics used
for evaluation of the green approach in organic synthesis under optimized
conditions. It can be seen clearly from Table 2 that the calculated values of green metrics
namely E-factor, process mass intensity, reaction
mass efficiency, carbon efficiency, and atom economy, are closer to
the ideal values. All calculations are provided in the Supporting Information.

Further, on the basis of literature survey, we had
investigated
the efficacy of ASMNPs in comparison with previously reported catalysts
(Table 3). It is evident
from Table 3 that the
presence of ASMNPs results in high yielding products. Additionally,
it was also observed that the presence of ASMNPs provided milder reaction
conditions and a shorter reaction time with no use of solvents.

General Method for Synthesis
of 2-Amino-4H-benzopyrans
(4a–4p)
Using the optimized reaction conditions, we
investigated the use of various electron-releasing and electron-withdrawing
benzaldehydes keeping malononitrile and dimedone constant. Equivalent
amounts of benzaldehyde, dimedone, and malononitrile were taken and
catalyst ASMNP (10 mg) was added and all ingredients were ground for
about 2–10 min at room temperature, which resulted into a vax-
or jellylike reaction mixture. Subsequently, 3–4 mL of 95%
ethanol was added into the reaction mixture to dissolve wax or jelly
substances. The catalyst was isolated from the reaction mixture with
the help of magnet, washed with ethanol thoroughly (3 × 5 mL),
dried in air, and reused in subsequent reactions. The crude product
was purified by simple recrystallization with ethanol. A wide variety
of 2-amino-4H-benzopyrans were synthesized in good
to excellent yields by screening an array of benzaldehydes having
electron-withdrawing as well as electron-donating groups. Here, we
examined that aromatic aldehydes bearing electron-withdrawing groups
provided the desired product in excellent yields (Table 4, entries 2–11) as compared
with aromatic aldehydes bearing electron-donating groups (Table 4, entries 12–15).

Mechanistic Pathway
The mechanism of the reaction of
tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran derivatives in the presence
of ASMNP catalyst via a three-component coupling strategy is driven
by specifically the basic amino sites. It is suggested to occur through
the formation of arylidiene malononitrile via Knoevenagel condensation
between malononitrile and aromatic aldehyde in the first step. Michael
addition of dimedone to arylidiene malononitrile occurs to form the
intermediate in the second step. Finally, intramolecular cyclization
occurs followed by protonation to the intermediate, which results
in the desired product and regenerate catalyst in the reaction mixture.
The plausible mechanism for the synthesis of the desired product tetrahydrobenzo[b] pyran is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Plausible mechanism for the synthesis of 2-amino-4[H]-benzo[b]pyrans via ASMNPs.

Further, the molecular structure of compound 4m was
established by utilizing single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
Single X-ray crystallography is one of the most comprehensive techniques
that is utilized to determine the chemical structure of compounds.
One of the most important requirements for obtaining the high accuracy
of crystallographic structures is that a “good crystal”
of the synthesized compound must be found. To perform the single XRD
analyses, it is always a pleasure to look at a crystal that seems
to be perfect in the Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur diffractometer. Although
all synthesized 2-amino-4H-benzopyrans (4a–4p) compounds were crystallized, the crystal of one of the compounds
in the series viz 4m seemed to have well-formed faces
and edges associated with no cracks, striations, and bubbles in the
diffractometer. Hence, we have selected compound 4m for
single-crystal X-ray analysis to confirm the structure of synthesized
2-amino-4H-benzopyrans. Figure 5 represents the crystal packing structural
arrangement of compound 4m, which further proves the
stability of tetrahydrobenzo[b] pyran compounds.
The crystal structure was solved by using olex 2.1.238 and winGX software (Shelx86 method).39 All parameters, such as the crystal data and structure
refinement table (Table S1), fractional
atomic coordinates (×104) and equivalent isotropic
displacement parameters (Å2 × 103)
(Table S2), anisotropic displacement parameters
(Å2 × 103) for compound 4m (Table S3), bond lengths (Table S4), and bond angles (Table S5) are provided in the Supporting Information of this
article.

1919512).

Recycling Procedure of
the Catalyst
After completion
of the first reaction using NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 (ASMNPs), the reaction mixture was diluted with
ethanol and then the catalyst was separated by using an external magnet.
The recovered catalyst was washed several times with ethanol to insure
no contamination, dried, and reused in the second reaction. Similar
steps were carried out after the second reaction. The recovered catalyst
can be used upto eight cycles with no significant loss of catalytic
activity of the catalyst. To further ensure no loss in activity of
the catalyst, it was tested three times for the model reaction. The
plot of the conversion percentage and number of runs for eight cycles,
which is repeated three times, has been demonstrated in Figure 6. We had observed that there
was not much deviation in the conversion percentage in all three runs.

Figure 6 Catalyst
reusability test for consecutive runs for synthesis of
2-amino-4H-benzo[b]pyran after repeating
the test three times.

Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FT-IR)
FT-IR
spectroscopy was employed for qualitative detection and confirmation
of different functional groups present in all three nanocomposites.
The comparative study for FT-IR spectra of all three powdered samples
was carried out using KBr pellets in the range of υ̅ =
400–4000 cm–1. It is obvious from Figure 7a that the intense
vibration band peak at 583 cm–1 is the characteristic
peak of stretching vibration of Fe–O bond of Fe3O4 NPs. The broad band at 3418 cm–1 corresponds
to the O–H stretching vibrations arising from surface −OH
groups.40 Further, the coating of silica
over the surface of MNPs can be confirmed by the appearance of characteristic
peaks at 804, 958, and 1098 cm–1, which were assigned
to the Si–O–Si symmetric, Si–O symmetric, and
Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching modes, respectively, as
shown in Figure 7b.
Also, the reduction in the intensity of the Fe–O adsorption
vibration suggested the formation of desired SiO2@Fe3O4 NPs. Further, the functionalization of amino
propyl group over the surface of SMNPs was confirmed by two distinct
bands (Figure 7c) at
1637 and 2912 cm–1 corresponding to the primary
amine (−NH2) and methylene (−CH2) groups, respectively.41

(b) SMNPs, and (c) ASMNPs.

Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) Analysis
To acquire
information about purity and crystallographic structure of prepared
nanocomposites, PXRD analysis was done and represented in Figure 8. PXRD of bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles is depicted in Figure 8a, which displayed diffraction
patterns consistent with standard PXRD data of the Joint Committee
on Powder Diffraction Standards card no. (19-0629) for pure cubic
inverse spinel structure of Fe3O4 crystals. Figure 8a displayed Bragg
peaks at 2⊖ = 30.3, 35.6, 43.3, 57.4, 62.9°, which are
attributed to (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0),
(5 1 1), and (4 4 0) crystallographic
faces of magnetite, respectively. Similar peaks were obtained for
SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Figure 8b), which indicated
the retention of the crystalline magnetic core. The PXRD pattern of
SMNPs (Figure 8b) showed
a weak broad hump centered at 2⊖ = 20–25°, which
confirmed the presence of amorphous silica coating around the magnetic
core.42 Apart from these, no extra peaks
were obtained, demonstrating highly pure magnetic nanoparticles. Figure 8c,d represented the
powder X-ray diffraction analysis of ASMNPs and recovered ASMNPs,
respectively.

(b) SiO2@Fe3O4 (SMNPs), (c) ASMNPs,
and (d)
recovered ASMNPs.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) Analysis
To
know about surface morphologies and size of synthesized nanoparticles,
TEM analysis of MNPs, SMNPs, ASMNPs, and recovered ASMNPs was conducted.
As the coating of silica was done on iron oxide nanoparticles, the
size of nanoparticles increased, and after the incorporation of amine
sites, we found that the size of nanoparticles was approximately 28
nm. Further, the size of the recycled nanoparticles become less (approximately
20 nm after eight runs) due to the grinding process. The high-resolution
TEM micrograph (Figure 9a) of Fe3O4 NPs showed that it is composed
of tiny particles possessing a spherical shape with an average diameter
of 20 nm. Furthermore, the HRTEM of ASMNPs also confirmed the spherical
morphology of these nanoparticles (Figure 9c). The HRTEM of the recovered catalyst after
eight consecutive runs was also done (Figure 9d), which showed no significant changes in
the morphology.

recovered
ASMNPs at various magnifications.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analysis
For particle
morphology and texture elucidation, SEM images of the synthesized
MNPs, SMNPs, ASMNPs, and recovered ASMNPs were also obtained and shown
in Figure 10. The
rougher structures of SMNPs and ASMNPs could be attributed to successful
surface coating. Also, it can be concluded that the size of nanoparticles
after coating with silica and anchoring of amine group is not significantly
changed, revealing that MNPs were coated by a thin layer of silica.
The thickness of silica onto surface of MNPs could be increased by
varying the molar ratio of H2O/tetra-ethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS).43 On increasing the molar ratio,
the size of silica coating also increases. The SEM images supported
the formation of spherically shaped Fe3O4 NPs,
which was in accordance with TEM analysis.

(b) SMNPs, (c) ASMNPs, and (d) recovered
ASMNPs at various magnifications.

Elemental and Compositional Analysis
Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy represents a powerful tool in the elemental
analysis of samples with great accuracy. Here, Figure 11a,b represents the EDX spectra of Fe3O4 and SiO2@Fe3O4, respectively. The EDX spectrum of Fe3O4 (MNPs)
shows the presence of Fe and O, while the EDX spectrum of NH2@SiO2@Fe3O4 (ASMNPs) shows the presence
of Fe, O, Si, C, and N, which confirmed the presence of silane shell
and amine group around the magnetic core material.

Vibrating Sample Magnetometric Analysis (VSM)
Magnetization
measurements were investigated at room temperature using a vibration
sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature in the external magnetic
range of −10 000 to +10 000 Oe. The magnetic
hysteresis curves of MNPs, SMNPs, and ASMNPs indicated the super magnetic
behavior of these nanoparticles.44 It is
obvious from Figure 12a that the synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(MNPs) showed a saturation magnetization value of 56 emu/g, which
decreased to 43 and 37 emu/g for SMNPs and ASMNPs, respectively (Figure 12b,c) NPs. This
decrease in saturation magnetization was attributed to the presence
of nonmagnetic amorphous coatings of SiO2 and functional
groups over the surface of Fe3O4 NPs. Regardless
of the sequential decrease in Ms values,
all obtained nanoparticles can be separated effortlessly from solution
via an external magnet.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized
a variety of tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyrans in good to
excellent yields using efficient and
economic amine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles under solvent
and waste-free reaction conditions. High tolerance of this procedure
toward different functional groups, easy work up of the desired products,
high reusability of the catalyst, and shorter reaction time are the
additional advantages for its application to academic and industrial
purposes. From a sustainability point of view, green chemistry parameters
like E-factor (0.08), atom economy (95.4%), and carbon
efficiency (96%) are in good agreement with the ideal values. The
structure of synthesized tetrahydrobenzo[b]pyran
(4m) was confirmed by single X-ray diffraction analysis
(CCDC 1919512).

Experimental Section
General Remarks
Ferric sulfate and ferrous sulfate
were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratory (SRL). Tetra-ethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) and APTES were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents
used were of analytical grade and obtained from Spectrochem and Merck.
Double-distilled water was used throughout the experiment. Thin-layer
chromatography was performed on Merck precoated silica gel aluminum
plates with 60 F254 indicator. The structural assignments
of synthesized compounds were based on 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectroscopy, and single X-ray diffraction analysis.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was acquired at 400 and 100 MHz for 1H NMR and 13C NMR, respectively, on a JEOL JNM-ECS
400 spectrometer instrument using CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-d6 as solvents. Tetramethylsilane
(TMS) was taken as reference in NMR, and data were processed with
its delta software. The coupling constant (J) is
reported in Hertz, and chemical shift values are reported in ppm for 1H NMR and multiplicities: s (singlet), d (doublet), and m
(multiplet). High-resolution mass spectroscopy was generated by an
Agilent ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. X-ray analysis was carried out
on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur Four-circle Diffractometer with
an Eos CCD detector using graphite monochromatized Mo-Ka radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å).

The morphology of the synthesized
MNPs and its derivatives obtained after modifications was examined
through a TECNAI 200 kV transmission electron microscope (Fei, Electron
Optics) equipped with digital imaging and a 35 mm photography system
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Jeol Japan Mode: JSM 6610LV).
The X-ray diffraction patterns of Fe3O4 NPs
and SiO2@Fe3O4 NPs were recorded
using Cu Kα radiation (l1/4 1.5406 Å)
on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Advanced, Germany) at
room temperature in a 2⊖ interval of 10–80. The FT-IR
spectra were recorded using a PERKIN ELMER 2000 FT-IR spectrophotometer
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 at room temperature
using KBr pellets. The magnetic properties of bare and immobilized
nanoparticles were determined with a vibrating sample magnetometer
(EV-9, Microsense, ADE) in the magnetic field sweeping between −10 000
and +10 000 Oe at room temperature.

by the coprecipitation method, as reported elsewhere.25 Briefly, Fe2(SO4)3 (6.0
g) and FeSO4 (4.2 g) were dissolved in 250 mL of deionized
water and the reaction mixture stirred at 60 °C till the appearance
of a yellowish-orange solution. Then, ammonium hydroxide (25%) was
added slowly to adjust the pH of the solution to 10 and the reaction
mixture was allowed to stir continuously for 1 h at 60 °C. NPs
were precipitated as a black substance, which were separated by an
external magnet and washed with deionized water and ethanol several
times until the filtrate showed pH 7 and then finally dried under
vacuum.

Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis of SMNPs
The
coating of silica over prepared MNPs was achieved using the sol–gel
approach.43 Briefly, a suspension of 0.5
g of MNPs and 0.1 m HCl (2.2 mL) was prepared in the mixture of ethanol
(200 mL) and water (50 mL) under sonication for 1 h at room temperature.
After this period, 25% NH4OH (5 mL) was added to this solution,
followed by the addition of TEOS (1 mL) dropwise and the resulting
solution was stirred at 60 °C for 6 h. The resulting SMNPs were
then separated magnetically and washed several times with ethanol
and then dried under vacuum.

Procedure for Catalytic Activity Test for
Compound 4c
A mixture of 4-bromobenzaldehyde (1 mmol), dimedone
(1 mmol), malononitrile
(1 mmol), and ASMNPs (10 mg) was taken in a mortar and ground, till
it converts into a thick pastelike reaction mixture, at room temperature.
After completion of the reaction, 3–4 mL of 95% ethanol was
added into the reaction mixture to dissolve the thick paste substance.
Subsequently, ASMNPs were recovered with the help of a magnet, washed
with ethanol thoroughly, dried overnight, and reused. The crude product
was obtained by the simple recrystallization technique with ethanol.
Recrystallized 2-amino-4H-benzo[b]pyrans were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
