Recently, targeting
the G protein-biased signaling has emerged
as an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating severe acute pain
with the potential to reduce the side effect of the traditional opioid
drug. Herein, we describe the discovery of a highly potent G protein-biased
μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, SHR9352. This novel molecule
exhibited excellent MOR activity and limited β-arrestin recruitment,
as well as a high selectivity over κ-opioid receptor and δ-opioid
receptor demonstrated robust in vivo efficacy and displayed favorable
pharmacokinetic properties across species.

Introduction
μ-Opioid receptor
(MOR) agonists, such as morphine and its
derivatives, are among the most effective analgesics in clinical use,
but their efficacies are always accompanied by opioid-related adverse
effects, including respiratory repression, constipation, nausea, vomiting,
and drug addiction.1−4

In recent years, the concept of the biased G protein-coupled
receptor
(GPCR) ligands has been developed by several groups from both academia
and industry.5−8 It was hypothesized that G protein-biased MOR agonists that selectively
activate MOR G protein signaling with minimal or no recruitment of
β-arrestin-2 would retain equivalent or better analgesic activity
while decreasing the β-arrestin-2-dependent side effects. Pharmacological
studies using β-arrestin-2 knockout mice treated with morphine
had shown a significant reduction in the level of the respiratory
repression and constipation, with the observation of enhanced analgesia.9,10

To date, several ligands with different chemical scaffolds
have
been developed.5,6,11,12 TRV130 (Oliceridine), the first example
of this class, stimulates G protein activation by presumably changing
the conformation of MOR upon its binding and results in little β-arrestin-2
recruitment.12 TRV130 has demonstrated
potent analgesia with reduced respiratory repression and constipation
in both preclinical studies and clinical trials.5,8,12−14 Manglik et al. recently
developed another biased MOR agonist with a different chemotype, such
as PZM21 (Figure 1).
Compared with morphine, PZM21 was reported to be more efficacious,
with reduced on-target liabilities.6

Figure 1 Examples of
typical structures of biased ligands.

In 2013, Trevena Inc. disclosed their study of the discovery
of
TRV130, including detailed structure–activity relationship
(SAR) information. It was reported that methyl substitution at the
benzylic position (compounds T-1, T-2, and T-3) resulted in 6–40
fold potency loss (Figure 2). “It was concluded that substitution on the benzylic
position was not preferred and no further chemistry efforts were undertaken
at this position”.14 Occasionally,
we found that the benzylic position fused to the aromatic ring resulted
in unexpected results and further optimization of the substitutions
on this fused ring has profound influence on the β-arrestin-2
recruitment. Ultimately these efforts culminated in the discovery
of a remarkably high potency and efficacious biased MOR agonist: SHR9352.

Figure 2 SAR information
of benzylic position substitutions.

Results and Discussion
Initially, the lead discovery efforts
focused on fusing a saturated
ring-afforded diastereomeric pyran amine 1 and 2. Unlike the reported benzylic isomers T2 and T3, which displayed
similar MOR potency,14 the (S)-pyran amine 2 delivered a much higher potency, whereas
the corresponding (R) isomer 1 showed very weak MOR activity
(Figure 2). Inspired
by this result, we focused on the (S) configuration to further explore
SAR of the benzo-fused rings. Unfortunately, the hit compound 2 was found to exhibit very high β-arrestin-2 activity
(Emax = 171%, EC50 = 63 nM, Table 1). As for the low
β-arrestin-2, recruitment was the key for a biased MOR agonist;
more efforts were involved to modify that.

Table 1 SAR of
the Benzylic-Fused Ring Series
a TRV130 was used
as the positive
control, and its EC50 was 7.9 nM in this cAMP assay; the
maximal response was defined as 100% at 10 μM TRV130.

b Morphine was used as the β-arrestin
assay positive control and its Emax was
defined as 100% at 10 μM morphine. The β-arrestin Emax of TRV130 is 14% compared to that of morphine.

c All of the data were the mean
value
of three measurements.

The
first round SAR was focused on the substitutions of the saturated
ring and phenyl group. It was found that fluorine on the aromatic
ring (compound 3) afforded the MOR cAMP potency similar
to 2, whereas it exhibited higher β-arrestin recruitment
(Emax = 341%). The six-membered carbon
cycle amine 4 delivered the same level of MOR and β-arrestin
potency compared to that of compound 2. Then, additional
groups were introduced on the saturated ring to afford compounds 5–10 to modulate the potency. The hydroxyl
group was installed on the
saturated ring, as shown in Table 1. It was found that the cis substituted compound 6 has higher β-arrestin Emax than that of the trans isomer 5. Encouragingly, the
trans-methoxyl 8 further decreased the β-arrestin
recruitment (Emax = 30%). Ketone 9 was taken into consideration with a reduced chiral center,
which had moderate β-arrestin activity but was less potent toward
MOR activity. Then, vinyl cyanide 10 was obtained, which
resulted in very high β-arrestin activity (Emax = 334%), whereas it resulted with decreased MOR cAMP
potency.

Different ring sizes and aromatic groups were further
investigated.
The benzo-5-membered ring series 11 and 12 both afforded high MOR cAMP potency. Meanwhile, methyl ether 12 displayed much higher β-arrestin recruitment than
that of 9, possibly due to the different angle of the
methoxyl group. Other aromatic groups instead of the phenyl group
were also prepared (13–16). It was
observed that the benzene series had lower β-arrestin Emax (14 vs 9 and 16 vs 17). The result showed that thiophene 16 delivered less MOR potency than its analogue 14, although the structural difference among them was only the sulfur
position.

In the next step, acetal group was introduced to replace
carbonyl
to afford compound 17, yielding an improvement of 2-fold
better MOR potency and decrement of β-arrestin activity compared
to that of its precursor 9. Considering that thio-acetal
was more stable than acetal group, thioether 18 (hereafter
named as SHR9352) was then prepared, which afforded a remarkably high
MOR potency (EC50 = 0.77 nM), with minimal β-arrestin
recruitment (Emax = 18.8%).

Inspired
by the biased activity seen in SHR9352, we would like
to further understand its binding to the MOR receptor at the molecular
level. On the basis of a published MOR agonist cocrystal structure
(PDB code: 5C1M),15 the TRV130 molecule was modeled into
the ligand binding site using MOE. As shown in Figure 3 and Scheme 1, the modeled TRV130 formed four key interactions with
MOR as follows: first, the basic amine formed the signature ionic
interaction with D1473.32. Second, the pyridine ring formed
π–π interaction with the histidine ring of the
amino-terminal residue H54. Third, the spiro cyclopentyl ring was
surrounded by a set of hydrophobic residues. These include S55, Q1242.60, N1272.63, W133, V1433.29, I1443.28, and C217. Last, the thiophene and pyridine rings were
surrounded by nine residues, Y1483.33, M1513.36, V2365.42, V3006.55, H2976.52,
I2966.51, W2936.48, W3187.35, I3227.39, and Y3267.43. As shown by the generic GPCR
residue numbers,16 five of them were located
in helix 5 and 6, whose conformational changes
were reported in the literature as relevant to the biased GPCR signaling.17 The proposed binding model was also in agreement
with the reported SAR of TRV130 in that modification in the thiophene
ring and the inversion of the stereochemistry of the pyridine ring
affected the G protein/β-arrestin selectivity.14 SHR9352 was modeled similar to the binding mode of TRV130
while maintaining all of the key interactions mentioned above. The
1,3-dithiolane group pointed to the same direction as the methoxy
group on thiophene ring of TRV130, which packs even closer to W2936.48 and
I2966.51, both of which were located on helix 6.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route to SHR9352
Reagent
and conditions: (i) Boc2O, Et3N, CH2Cl2; (ii) KMnO4, MgSO4, acetone/H2O, 52% two steps;
(iii) HCl, CH2Cl2, 65%; (iv) NaBH(OAc)3, CH2Cl2, 33%; (v) pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate, toluene, 110 °C, 96%.

The synthetic route of SHR9352 was straight forward. It started
with (S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-amine 19, which could be obtained from a known procedure.18 The protection of benzylic amine with Boc group,
followed by oxidation, delivered ketone 21 in 52% combined
yield. The resulting amine from removal of the protecting group reacted
with the reported intermediate 23(19) afforded compound 9. Finally, the thio-acetal
functional group was installed under standard condition to furnish
SHR9352 with quantitative yield.

Then, SHR9352 was moved for
further in vitro study, which exhibited
high potency in mouse and rat MOR cAMP assays consistently (Table 2). In addition, SHR9352
had potencies of 37 and 115 nM in human κ-opioid receptor (KOR)
and human δ-opioid receptor (DOR) cAMP accumulation assays,
respectively, achieving 48-fold (hKOR/hMOR) selectivity over KOR and
149-fold (hDOR/hMOR) selectivity over DOR.

Table 3 summarized
the pharmacokinetic (PK) data of SHR9352 across species. This compound
exhibited low clearance in rats and dogs (CL was 17.0 and 16.1 mL/(min
kg), respectively) and displayed linear dose-exposure relationship
in rats from 0.05 to 0.5 mpk. In addition, the clearance was similar
and showed comparable exposures in mice when compared intravenously
(iv) with subcutaneous (sc) administrations. As shown in Table 3, the overall PK profile
of SHR9352 was good across species, with an improved T1/2 from rodent to nonrodent animals.

The rat incision assay was one of the tests used to measure the
efficacy of analgesics.5,20 The advantage of this model was
its relatively high reproducibility. Therefore, this model was employed
in the study of SHR9352. Consistent with high in vitro potency, SHR9352
displayed a remarkable efficacious character even at 0.01 mpk dosage.
Meanwhile, a clear dose-dependent effect was observed from 0.01 to
0.03 mpk (90–128.7% effect). The 0.03 mpk dosage efficacy seems
higher than that of the control blank group, possibly due to the added
anesthesia effect of the drug. In another separate experiment, a higher
dosage was also tested while saturated efficacy could be observed.
It is worth mentioning that TRV130 was used as an internal reference
and its 0.1 mpk dosage reached efficacy comparable to that of SHR9352
at 0.01 mpk dosage (Figure 4).

Figure 4 In vivo rat incisional pain study.

Moreover, the β-arrestin associated side effect was
investigated
in the mouse charcoal meal model.21 TRV130
was also used as a reference control. It was found that with SHR9352,
there was almost no display of the constipation effect after 0.02
mpk sc administration compared to that in the control group and TRV130
at 0.1 mpk. As shown in Figure 5, the percentages of gastrointestinal transit were 45.4, 44.5,
and 42.2%, respectively. This result correlated well with the in vitro
β-arrestin profile.

transit test.

Because MOR expressed
in brain played a key role in opioid mediated
analgesia, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of ligands was
one of the important parameters driving the efficacy. Thus, the Kp-unbound value was introduced to evaluate
the BBB penetration ability.22,23 As indicated in Figure 6 and Table 4, the brain concentration of
SHR9352 was 403 ng/g and the Kp-unbound value was 0.334.a Both the favorable Kp-unbound value and high brain concentration
of SHR9352 indicated good central-nervous system penetration, which
supported the observed robust efficacy in the rat incision model.

In addition, the Cytochrome
P450 inhibitory potential of SHR9352
was investigated to assess the potential likelihood of drug–drug
interactions (DDIs) of major CYPs, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19,
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. As highlighted in Table 5, SHR9352 had no CYP450 inhibitions in terms
of 1A2, 2C9, and 2C19 but had moderate levels of inhibitions for CYP2D6
and CYP3A4 isozymes. However, due to very strong in vitro potency
and low in vivo efficacious dosage (0.01 mpk), the CYP safety margin
was considered to be sufficiently enough without DDI liability.b

Finally,
we conducted a non-good laboratory practice 7 day acute
rat toxicity study of SHR9352 at dosages of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.5 mpk.
All of the dosages were well tolerated and no obvious abnormal findings
were observed, except at the highest dose of 0.5 mpk for male rats,
an elevation of monocytes percentage was found (mono %, p < 0.05). On the basis of a general toxic investigation, including
body weight, hematology, blood chemistry, clinical observations, gross
necropsy, and toxicokinetic analysis, it was concluded that no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) and maximum tolerance dose were 0.15
mpk and over 0.5 mpk, respectively. The estimated safety margin was
at least 15-fold on the basis of the efficacious dose of 0.01 mpk
and the NOAEL at 0.15 mpk.c

In summary,
SHR9352 demonstrated a highly potent G protein-biased
MOR agonist. It exhibited excellent MOR cAMP activity and limited
β-arrestin recruitment as well as a high selectivity over KOR
and DOR. This novel molecule entity displayed favorable PK profiles
across species and a robust in vivo efficacy with diminished β-arrestin
associated side effects. Moreover, SHR9352 showed a sufficiently large
safety window due to its very low efficacious dose and sub-nanomolar
level in vitro potency. Additional tests and studies involving the
rat constipation models were ongoing, and more relevant data will
be disclosed in due course.
