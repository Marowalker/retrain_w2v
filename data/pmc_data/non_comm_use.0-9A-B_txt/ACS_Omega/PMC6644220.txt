We report herein a synthetic protocol
for the preparation of 1,3-dibromo-1,1-difluoro-2-propanone,
a new synthon used for the first time in a reaction with aromatic
amines and sodium thiocyanate, leading to thiazoles which are useful
candidates in drug discovery programs. The new synthon allows to introduce
a bromodifluoromethyl group at the C4 of the thiazole, and it is amenable
of further transformation such as the Br/F exchange useful in radiopharmaceutics.
Application of the strategy to the preparation of a precursor of the
biologically relevant DF2755Y is also reported.

==== Body
Introduction
The increased presence
of fluorine in pharmaceuticals1 and agrochemicals,2 as well as in material sciences,3 continues
to stimulate research interests in the development of methodologies
for the preparation of fluorine-containing compounds.4 Among the several approaches for the introduction of a
fluorinated moiety into organic molecules, methods for trifluoro-
and difluoromethylation as well as difluoromethylenation have been
widely provided in recent years.5 In contrast,
methods for the introduction of halodifluoromethyl units (−CF2X) have received less attention. Thus, convenient strategies
for introducing −CF2X groups are still in demand
because halodifluoromethylated compounds are useful synthetic intermediates6 for the preparation of biologically relevant
compounds, as the difluoromethylene unit is considered isosteric and
isopolar to an ethereal oxygen.7 In addition,
iodo, bromo, and chlorodifluoromethylated aromatics and heteroaromatics
are recognized as potential candidates for undergoing the halogen/fluorine
exchange processes,8 and thus potential
valuable precursors of [18F]trifluoromethylated compounds
for positron emission tomography imaging.9 Moreover, because of the relatively short half-life (110 min) of
the 18F radioisotope, the (hetero)aryl CF2–[18F] bond construction is often required as the late-stage
synthetic step.10 In this context, we became
interested in the chemistry of fluorinated 2-aminothiazoles as structural
elements screened in our drug discovery programs.11 In particular, our recent efforts focused on (2S)-2-(4-{[4-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino}phenyl)propanoic
acid (DF2755Y) (Scheme 1), a small molecule belonging to a novel allosteric dual CXCR1/CXCR2
inhibitor with a favorable oral pharmacokinetic profile. This molecule
selectively inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis induced by CXCR1/2 ligands
without affecting on CXCL8 binding to these receptors. The activation
of CXCR1/2 has been implicated in the genesis of inflammatory and
postoperative pain and progression of severe chronic diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s
disease, melanoma, and several urological diseases.12 Furthermore, the results might suggest that this small
molecule can be a candidate for a novel therapeutic option to control
inflammatory and postoperative pain.13

Scheme 1 Given the importance in drug discovery of this promising
molecule
and other fluorinated aminothiazoles in the pipeline, we embarked
in a project aimed at developing 4-bromodifluoromethyl aminothiazole
scaffolds as potential precursors of [18F]-radiotracers
by a late-stage Br/F exchange reaction.

On the basis of these
premises, we noticed that the main strategies
available for introducing the CF2Br group into (hetero)aromatic
rings rely on: (a) a direct incorporation of the bromodifluoromethyl
group as a +CF2Br equivalent in the presence
of arylmetal species (Scheme 2a),14 (b) a direct radical bromodifluoromethylation
of heteroaromatics (i.e. benzofurans or benzo[b]thiophene)
using the BrCF2SO2Na reagent (Scheme 2b),15 and (c) a bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)
or Br2 of fluorine-containing compounds (Scheme 2c).16 However, each strategy has synthetic limitations, whereas complementary
ways to CF2Br-containing building blocks are quite rare
and reported the use of BrCF2CO2Et or the corresponding
carboxylic acid as CF2Br-containing building blocks for
the synthesis of 2-CF2Br-substituted 1,3-imidazolines,
1,3-oxazolines, 1,3-benzoxazole, and 5-(CF2Br)-1,2,4-oxadiazoles
for pharmaceutical scopes.17 We reasoned
that the use of a new CF2Br-containing reagent could have
been an alternative strategy to construct other CF2Br-substituted
heterocycles.

Scheme 2 Strategies (a–c) for the Construction of Bromodifluoromethylated
Scaffolds
Various methodologies,
such as Hantzsch and Cook–Heilbron,
have been reported for the synthesis of aminothiazole and their derivatives.
The Hantzsch thiazole synthesis, one of the widest used methodology,
involves the reaction of α-halo carbonyl compounds with thiourea
or thioamides.18 To the best our knowledge,
there are no reported examples on the use of the Hantzsch-type approach
for the preparation of 4-CF2Br-substituted 2-aminothiazoles,
whereas it is reported an isolate example of direct C-5 bromodifluoromethylation
of 2-trifluoroacetamido-4-(trifluoromethyl)thiazole by treatment with n-BuLi and CF2Br2 at low temperature.19

Thereby, we envisioned that a 1,3-dihalo-1,1-difluoro-2-propanone
could be an attractive building block to provide straightforward access
to 4-CF2Br-substituted 2-aminothiazoles, by reaction with
aromatic amines and sodium thiocyanate.20 With our surprise, we were unable to find precedence about the synthesis
of this type of synthon (Scheme 2).

Results and Discussion
We started
our investigation by exploring different synthetic pathways
for obtaining the desired synthon 3 (Scheme 3). First, with the aim to introduce
by a one-pot procedure two bromine atoms at 1,3-positions of commercially
available 1,1-difluoropropanone, the commonly reported halogenation
protocol with Br2 or NBS was considered. In principle,
the double bromination of this substrate, on both sp3 carbons,
could have directly provided us the desired product. However, monitoring
this reaction in a NMR tube using Br2, catalytic AcOH,
and CDCl3 as solvent, only mono bromination occurred with
high selectivity at C-3, giving bromoketone 2 in good
yield, whereas the CF2H group resulted insensitive to bromine.
All attempts, using Br2 or NBS in the presence of acid
or AIBN, to introduce a second bromine atom at C-1 failed. With these
lines of evidence in hand, we explored a different strategy, evaluating
the possibility of a direct introduction of the halomethyl moiety
by nucleophilic addition of a metalated halomethyl group on a readily
available difluoromethyl acetate 4a or the corresponding
acylchloride 4b (Scheme 3b). Very recently, we developed an efficient flow method
for the direct halomethylation of several electrophiles by trapping
of halomethyllithium intermediates generated from haloiodomethanes.21 Thus, we explored the reactivity of lithium
carbenoids, derived from ICH2Cl and I2CH2, with commercial ester 4a and acyl chloride 4b exhibiting the CF2Br group. Under optimized
reaction conditions, using MeLi·LiBr as a lithiating agent and
1:1 diethyl ether/tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixture as a solvent, at −78
°C under internal quenching conditions, 1H NMR and
GC–MS analysis (Scheme 3b) revealed the formation of a complex mixture, and all attempts
to isolate the detected products 3b and 3c failed.

Scheme 3 Alternative Approaches (a,b) for the Synthesis of
Synthon 3
After these unsatisfactory results, a different approach
was evaluated,
and based on the preliminary introduction of a methyl group into ester 4a, leading to ketone 5, followed by a subsequent
bromination step, as reported in Scheme 4. Thus, according to a reported protocol,
we attempted the reaction of the commercially available ethyl 1-bromo-1,1-difluoroethanoate 4a with methylmagnesium bromide, in diethyl ether at −78
°C. After 1H, 19F, and 13C NMR
analysis, we were pleased to confirm the presence of the expected
ketone 5 (76% yield). Unfortunately, the high volatility
of the product did not allow the complete removal of diethyl ether
solvent. Therefore, the ethereal solution of 5, titrated
by 1H NMR using mesitylene as the internal standard, was
directly used for the following step.

Scheme 4 Two-Step Synthesis
of Synthon 3
The subsequent bromination step afforded 3a in 80%
yield (Scheme 4). The
best reaction conditions for bromination used trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) as a solvent and heated at 40 °C for 16 h. To reduce the
formation of polyhalogenated side products, Br2 was added
in portions, whereas reaction evolution was monitored by 1H- and 19F NMR. Under these conditions, the conversion
of 5 was complete and the ketone 3a was
isolated in high purity by distillation (>90% by NMR). This halogenated
ketone resulted sensitive to air and moisture, thus requiring inert
atmosphere conditions, amber container, and because of its volatility,
it is recommended for low-temperature (4 °C) storage.

With
this new synthon in hand, the synthesis of 4-bromodifluoromethyl-thiazoles
(6a–l) was directly carried out by condensation
of ketone 3a with several aromatic amines and in the
presence of sodium thiocyanate (Scheme 5).22 As reported in Scheme 4, the reaction worked
well with several aromatic amines being tolerant to different substituents
on the aromatic ring. The presence of a strong electron-withdrawing
group as in the case of the p-nitroaniline provided
low yield of the corresponding thiazole 6d. In striking
contrast, the reaction was not significantly affected by the presence
of fluoro, trifluoromethyl, and methylsulfonyl groups, affording derivatives 6b, 6c, and 6i in good yields. The
presence on the aromatic ring of electron-donating substituents was
also tolerated, leading to derivatives 6j and 6l in high yields. Unfortunately, the expected thiazoles 6m and 6n were not observed using 2-aminopyridine and
4-bromo-2-nitroaniline, likely because of an electronic effect that
could decrease the nucleophilicity of the amine nitrogen.

Scheme 5 Scope of
the Reaction
With the aim to further
validate the importance of this kind of
functionalized bromodifluoromethylated thiazoles, we investigated
the possibility to setup a fast and reproducible halogen/fluorine-exchange
protocol. In particular, we were keen to demonstrate that the bromine
atom could be replaced by the fluorine atom, using a fluoride anion
as nucleophile, and in a reasonable time, compatible with 18F-fluorination platforms. In fact, the use of anionic nucleophilic
fluorination is preferred over electrophilic fluorination because
of the higher specific activity after radiolabeling.23 Derivatives 6a and 6j were used
as test compounds and subjected to reaction under “cold”
conditions using KF as the source of fluoride ions, kryptofix 222
as the cryptand for potassium cation, and AgOTf as the promoter in
acetonitrile at room temperature (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Applications of Halogen/Fluorine Exchange
As reported in Scheme 6, the reaction performed very
well providing the exchange
products 7a and 7j quantitatively in only
5–15 min, as demonstrated by 19F NMR monitoring
(see Supporting Information). Nicely, the
observed short reaction time for complete Br/F exchange could potentially
be useful for a late-stage 18F radiolabeling experiment.
Next, the preparation of 2-aminothiazole 8 was also pursued
using synthon 3a in the presence of thiourea, obtaining
thiazole 8 in almost quantitative yield. Exchange protocol
on thiazole 8 provided the 2-amino-4-trifluoromethylthiazole 9, a valuable building block in medicinal chemistry; however,
at 25 °C, a variable degree of fluorine incorporation was observed,
depending on the reaction time (Scheme 6). To further prove the usefulness of this approach,
the synthon 3a was tested for the preparation of Br-DF2755,
a precursor of the drug candidate DF2755Y. As reported in Scheme 7, reacting 3a with chiral (S)-p-aminophenylacetic
acid in the presence of sodiumthiocyanate led to the target compound
Br-DF2755 in good yield (Scheme 7). With the precursor Br-DF2755 in our hands, we investigated
the possibility of Br/F exchange under optimized conditions. We were
glad to observe a complete exchange in 20 min by using the optimized
conditions adopted for 6a and 6j (Scheme 6) in terms of reagents
stoichiometry but running the reaction at 80 °C. This represents
a remarkable result for us because it opens the possibility either
to develop a radiotracer for DF2755Y or to investigate the drug distribution
in vivo.

Scheme 7 Applications of the Strategy to DF2755Y
Conclusions
In conclusion, we reported,
for the first time, a new synthetic
strategy for the synthesis of 4-CF2Br-substituted 2-aminothiazoles
based on the use of the 1,3-dibromo-1,1-difluoro-2-propanone as a
useful synthon. The usefulness of this reagent has been demonstrated
in preparation of several 4-bromodifluoromethyl thiazoles which are
precursors for a Br/F exchange reaction. The strategy has been applied
to the preparation of Br-DF2755, precursor of the biologically relevant
DF2755Y. Further studies ongoing in our laboratories are aimed at
preparing 18F-labeled derivatives and at expanding the
developed methodology. Results will be reported in due course.

Experimental
Section
General (Standard Techniques)
The chemicals (compounds 1, 2, 4a, and 4b) and
solvents were purchased from TCI Europe, Fluorochem, VWR, Aldrich
Chemical Company, and used without purification except Et2O and THF which were distilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use.
Melting points were measured with Büchi melting point B-545. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 18F NMR spectra
were recorded using Bruker 700, Agilent 300 and 500 MHz. CDCl3, CD3OD were used as solvents. Data are expressed
as follows: chemical shift [multiplicity, coupling constant in Hz,
integration]. Infrared spectra of the compounds were recorded by using
a PerkinElmer 283 spectrometer or by using attenuated total reflection
spectrophotometer in reciprocal centimeter. ESI-MS analyses performed
on Agilent 110 LC/MSD mass spectrometer with ionic single quadrupole
trap system and Exalibur data system. TLC was carried out on a 0.25
mm precoated silica gel thick plates (Merck) with a fluorescence indicator
F-254; compounds were detected either under UV light (at 254 nm) or
by spraying with sulfuric acid or permanganate solution. Silica gel
70–230 mesh and 230–400 mesh were used for flash chromatography
on glass columns.

Procedure for the Preparation of 1,3-Dibromo-1,1-difluoropropan-2-one
(3a)
According to the reported procedure,8 to a solution of ethyl 2-bromo-2,2-difluoroacetate
(10 g, 49.3 mmol) in dry diethyl ether (54 mL) at −78 °C,
methyl magnesiumbromide (3 M solution in diethyl ether, 18 mL) was
added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred at −78 °C
for 2.5 h and an additional 30 min at room temperature. The reaction
was quenched with water (5 mL), and the organic phase was dried over
sodium sulfate. The ethereal solution was filtrated and concentrated
under moderate vacuum (600–700 Torr) until 30 mL of final volume
because of the high volatility of the product. The concentration of
1-bromo-1,1-difluoropropan-2-one (51) was
evaluated by H NMR analysis using mesitylene as the internal
standard (1.25 M), 76% yield. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 2.46 (s, 3H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): δ 189.4 (t, J = 27.3 Hz, C=O),

NMR (282 MHz, CDCl3): δ −65.6 (2F). To a titrated
ethereal solution of 1-bromo-1,1-difluoropropan-2-one (6) (6.4 g, 37.4 mmol), TFA (980 μL, 12.8 mmol) was added dropwise.
To this solution, Br2 (1.9 mL, 37.4 mmol) was added in
portions (200 μL each) while monitoring the progress of the
reaction by 1H- and 19F NMR. The mixture was
heated at 40 °C and stirred for 16 h. The reaction was quenched
with aqueous solution of sodium metabisulfite (0.1 M, 100 μL).
The crude was diluted with dichloromethane (15 mL) and washed with
water (3 × 5 mL). The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate
and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The obtained brown
oil was purified by bulb to bulb distillation (50 °C, 10–2 Torr), affording the 1,3-dibromo-1,1-difluoropropan-2-one
(3a) as a colorless oil (4.7 g, 18.7 mmol), 80% yield.

at ambient temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, p-toluidine (41 mg, 0.39 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture
was heated to 80 °C for 3 h in an oil bath. After this time,
the mixture was taken up with 5 mL of AcOEt and filtered on celite
pad. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the crude
was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford the desired
product.

Procedure for the Synthesis of 4-(bromodifluoromethyl)thiazol-2-amine
(8)
To a solution of thiourea (30 mg, 0.39 mmol)
in dry acetonitrile (500 μL) in a sealed tube, 1,3-dibromo-1,1-difluoropropan-2-one
(3a) (100 mg, 0.39 mmol) was added dropwise, and the
mixture was heated to 80 °C for 3 h. The reaction crude was diluted
with ethyl acetate (3 mL) and washed with hexane. The organic phase
was filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to
afford thiazole 8 as a yellow solid (complete conversion). Rf 0.8 (30% EtOAc/n-hexane). 1H NMR (700 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.88 (s, 1H, HetAr-H),

General Procedure for Br/F
Exchange Reactions
Procedure
A for conversion of 8 to 9 is reported.
To a solution of 8 (25 mg, 0.11 mmol) in acetonitrile
(500 μL) in a sealed tube, silver triflate (28 mg, 0.11 mmol),
potassium fluoride (13 mg, 0.22 mmol), and Kriptofix (83 mg, 0.22
mmol) were consecutively added, and the mixture was stirred at room
temperature until TLC or 19F NMR sampling revealed the
full conversion. The crude was diluted with ethyl acetate (3 mL) and
washed with water (3 × 3 mL). The organic phase was dried over
sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed under vacuum. Filtration
on a pad of silica provided the analytically pure product. Procedure
B was used for conversion of Br-DF2755 to DF2755Y. To a solution of potassium fluoride (58 mg, 1.00 mmol) and Kriptofix
(83 mg, 0.22 mmol) in dry DMF (0.5 mL) at 80 °C in a sealed tube, Br-DF2755 (25 mg, 0.11 mmol) in 0.5 mL of dry DMF was added
dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 5 min, cooled
at room temperature, and 2 mL of a 1 M aqueous solution of HCl were
added. The crude was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 3 mL),
the organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent was
removed under vacuum. Treatment with CH2Cl2 (2
mL) led to the precipitation of DF2755Y in an analytically
pure form.
