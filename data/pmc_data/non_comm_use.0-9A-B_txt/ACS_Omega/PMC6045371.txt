Gold nanoparticles
(Au NPs) have been thoroughly investigated for
anti-cancer therapy. However, their undesired high gold content remains
a problem when injected into the body for drug delivery applications.
In this report, we made an effort to conjugate the curcumin molecules
on the surface of gold quantum clusters (Au QCs) by a novel in situ
synthesis method which provides an alternative route to not only reduce
the metallic content but also increase the water solubility of curcumin
and the loading efficiency. Here, curcumin itself acts as a reducing
and capping agent for the synthesis of Au QCs. The UV–vis absorption,
fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry results confirmed the synthesis of fluorescent Au
QCs. Curcumin-conjugated Au NPs (C-Au NPs) and glutathione (GSH)-conjugated
Au QCs (GSH-Au QCs) were also synthesized to visualize the effect
of particle size and the capping agent, respectively, on the cytotoxicity
to normal and cancer cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay showed that the curcumin-conjugated Au QCs (C-Au QCs)
were less cytotoxic to normal cells while almost the same cytotoxic
to cancer cells in comparison to curcumin itself, which indicates
that curcumin preserves its anticancer property even after binding
to the Au QCs. However, C-Au NPs and GSH-Au QCs did not show any cytotoxicity
against the normal and cancer cells at the concentration used. The
western blot assay indicated that C-Au QCs promote apoptosis in cancer
cells. Further, the in vivo study on severe combined immunodeficiency
mice showed that C-Au QCs also inhibited the tumor growth efficiently
without showing significant toxicity to internal organs.

==== Body
Introduction
Curcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione)
is a polyphenol and the main functional component of turmeric derived
from the rhizome of a medicinal plant—“Curcuma longa”.1 Curcumin has been used as the main ingredient of Indian spices and
traditional ayurvedic medicines since ancient times in the Asian countries.2 Curcumin has attracted enormous attention because
of its wide range of pharmacological applications such as antioxidant,
antiangiogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-Alzheimer,
antiparasitic, antiviral, and so forth.1,3−30 Earlier studies show that curcumin has chemopreventive activity
against several types of cancers such as prostate, breast, and colorectal
cancer.15,31,32 The molecular
basis of chemopreventive activity of curcumin is its effect on several
targets such as transcription factors (NF-κB), growth targets,
apoptotic genes (p53, Bcl-2), angiogenesis regulators, and cell signaling
genes (TNF-α).6,15

Despite numerous biological
activities, curcumin could not be used
efficiently for therapeutic applications because of its poor systemic
bioavailability originating from low water solubility and instability.2 To overcome the problem of water solubility of
curcumin, researchers have tried to make various formulations such
as encapsulation in polymeric nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles,
lipid micelles, metal nanoparticles, microemulsions, and the preparation
of curcumin analogues.17,32−35

Although, the complexation
of curcumin with metal nanoparticles
[especially with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs)] has been used in many
reports because of their low toxicity and biocompatible nature, gold
quantum clusters (Au QCs) made up of few to few tens of atoms may
also be used as an alternative because of their small size and interesting
physical properties.1,19,36−43 In our previous study, we observed in the density functional theory
calculations that upon conjugation of curcumin molecules with gold,
the intramolecular hydrogen bond distance increased, which facilitates
the formation of hydrogen bonding of curcumin molecules with the adjacent
water molecules and hence increases the water dispersibility of curcumin-conjugated
Au NPs.1 Au QCs show the discrete energy
of states resulting in the tunable emission of light from UV to near-infrared
(NIR) region.43−46 In the last decade, Au QCs acquired extremely high attention because
of their numerous benefits such as: (a) they are nontoxic to the mammalian
cells; (b) their size is smaller than the biomolecules of interest.
Therefore, they are unlikely to interfere in the normal biological
functions such as biomolecular interactions; (c) they possess optimal
photophysical properties including low photobleaching, absence of
blinking, large Stokes shift, high water dispersibility, and high
quantum yield; (d) NIR fluorescence; (e) they can act as an effective
radiosensitizer; and, finally, (f) they easy to synthesize and use
for labeling biomolecules.43 Au QCs have
been used extensively for in vitro and in vivo bioimaging, sensing,
drug delivery, photodynamic therapy, catalysis, and so forth.43,47−56

Au QCs have been used for cancer therapy in many studies by
several
groups. Huang et al. reported the use of photosensitizer-conjugated
silica-coated Au QCs for fluorescence imaging-guided photodynamic
therapy.57 Nair et al. designed a biocompatible
Au QC-based multifunctional system for fluorescence imaging-directed
photodynamic therapy, which is useful for efficient destruction and
monitoring of tumor cells.49 Zhang et al.
used epidermal growth factor receptor-conjugated Au QCs for targeted
cancer radiation treatment.58 Khandelia
et al. developed Au QC-embedded albumin nanoparticles as a doxorubicin
drug delivery vehicle for anticancer applications.59 Zhou et al. demonstrated the synthesis of cisplatin-conjugated
Au QCs for fluorescence imaging and targeted therapy of breast cancer.60 Recently, Chen et al. developed arginylglycylaspartic
acid- and aptamer-conjugated dual-targeting Au QCs bounded with doxorubicin
for tumor imaging and deep tissue therapy.61

There are several reports in which the biologically active
protein
molecules have been used for the synthesis of Au QCs where they act
as a reducing and capping agent and also able to retain their biological
activity. For example, Chen et al. synthesized lysozyme-protected
Au QCs which exhibited potential superior antimicrobial activity.62 Liu et al. reported insulin-directed synthesis
of Au QCs which were shown to retain the insulin bioactivity.63 Nair et al. developed NIR-emitting urease-conjugated
Au QCs for the highly selective sensing of urea in the whole blood
samples.64 However, there are very few
reports where small molecules used to synthesize Au QCs and able to
retain their biological activity as well. In this report, curcumin
molecules were utilized for the synthesis of Au QCs as a reducing
and capping agent and found to preserve their anticancer activity
with low cytotoxicity to normal mammalian cells in comparison to curcumin
alone. No other reducing agents (except curcumin) were used in the
synthesis of Au QCs.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Curcumin-Conjugated
Au QCs
The synthesis
of Au QCs using curcumin as both a reducing and capping agent is very
crucial regarding the solubility of curcumin. Curcumin exists in the
planar intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded form. It has a hydrophobic
nature because of the lack of polar groups in the aqueous medium at
neutral pH and the stretch of conjugated heptadiene backbone (Scheme 1).27 Curcumin is soluble in water only at the alkaline condition,
but at the same time, it also shows degradation. According to Price
and Buescher, the degradation rate constant rapidly increases from
pH ≈ 7.4 to a maximum at pH ≈ 10.2 and then declines
at higher pH values.26 Therefore, instead
of low pH where the curcumin molecules also have low solubility, a
high pH ≈ 13.5 was selected for the reaction where curcumin
molecules were completely soluble and the degradation rate constant
was also small.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Curcumin Structure
and the Synthesis
of C-Au QCs
Curcumin is a tautomeric compound
present in two forms, namely, keto and enol form.

The UV–vis spectroscopic study of curcumin in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and the alkaline medium shows two distinct absorption bands
at ∼262 and ∼425 nm, which are related to the n−π*
and π–π* transitions, respectively (Figure 1a).1,27 It
can be seen from Figure 1a that the transition at ∼262 nm was least affected when conjugated
with Au NPs and Au QCs. The UV–vis spectrum of C-Au NPs shows
a sharp peak in deep UV at ∼262 nm because of the n−π*
transition of curcumin molecules and a broad peak in the visible region
at ∼528 nm because of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
Interestingly, in the case of C-Au QCs and glutathione (GSH)-Au QCs,
the SPR peak was diminished, which shows the absence of Au NPs in
the suspension (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) UV–vis spectroscopic study of curcumin in DMSO and alkaline
conditions; C-Au QCs, C-Au NPs, and GSH-Au QCs. (b) Photoluminescence
spectra of C-Au QCs upon excitation with light of different wavelengths.

The photoluminescence study of
curcumin shows the emission at ∼545
nm at an excitation of ∼425 nm wavelength in the alkaline medium
(Figure S2). On the other hand, C-Au QCs
show the maximum intense emission peak ∼470 nm when excited
with the ∼360 nm wavelength of light (Figure 1b), whereas C-Au NPs did not show fluorescence
at any excitation wavelength because of the quenching by nonradiative
decay available in Au NPs (Figure S3).
However, GSH-Au QCs show photoluminescence at ∼800 nm when
excited with ∼450 nm wavelength of light (Figure S4).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of C-Au QCs and GSH-Au
QCs indicate the presence of ultrasmall particles with an average
size ∼2 nm. The particles were well-dispersed and uniform in
size (Figure 2). C-Au
NPs were also very well-dispersed with an average size ∼15
nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out to
confirm the size distribution of as-synthesized Au QCs and Au NPs
after dialysis. The DLS results correlated well with the particle
size measured by TEM analysis, considering the various contributions
to the hydrodynamic diameter. The mean hydrodynamic diameters of C-Au
QCs, GSH-Au QCs, and C-Au NPs were found to be ∼4.5, ∼2.3,
and ∼20.2 nm, respectively (Figures S5–S7). The larger hydrodynamic diameter of C-Au QCs in comparison to
the GSH-Au QCs might be due to the little aggregation of C-Au QCs
in the aqueous medium. Furthermore, DLS measurements were also conducted
to analyze the size distribution of C-Au QCs in fetal bovine serum
(FBS) containing cell culture media. There was no significant aggregation
noticed even after the incubation of C-Au QCs with the media for 1
day (Figure S8).

Figure 2 TEM images of C-Au QCs
(top layer), C-Au NPs (middle layer), and
GSH-Au QCs (bottom layer). The inset images are respective magnified
images.

To understand the binding behavior
of curcumin to the Au QCs, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) study was performed (Figure 3). Curcumin molecules showed three bands
at 1375, 1233, and 963 cm–1 (indicated with red
color fonts in Figure 3), which are due to the in-plane bending vibrations of the hydroxyl
group of the two phenolic groups and an enolic group, respectively.
All of these three bands were not observed in the case of C-Au QCs,
which shows the interaction of Au at these sites, whereas the presence
of two bands at 780 and 1428 cm−1 (indicated with
blue color fonts) in the spectrum of C-Au QCs related to the olefinic
in-plane bending vibrations of the heptadiene chain of curcumin confirm
the presence of intact curcumin after the C-Au QCs synthesis.40 Similarly, the two bands present in the spectra
of both curcumin and C-Au QCs at 1458 and 1024 cm–1 (indicated with pink color fonts) are due to the mixed vibration
of CH3 and aromatic −C=C–C, respectively, which confirmed
the presence of curcumin as a capping agent.65

Figure 3 FTIR
spectra of curcumin (black color) and C-Au QCs (red color).
The spectrum for C-Au QCs was multiplied by four to make all peaks
clearly visible.

Further, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) study was also
performed to analyze the functional groups of curcumin involved in
binding with C-Au QCs (Figure 4). The XPS measurements were carried out for the core-level
electrons of carbon, oxygen, and gold atoms. The XPS spectra of carbon
(C 1s) for curcumin can be deconvoluted in four peaks
situated at 284.5, 285, 286.3, and 287.3, corresponding to sp2 carbon, sp3 carbon, C–O, and C=O,
respectively. Most of the peaks for C 1s spectra
of C-Au QCs were also deconvoluted in four peaks almost at the same
place like curcumin, except the peak for C=O, which was located
at 286.7 eV. Therefore, the peak for C=O was found to be downshifted
by around 0.4 eV, which shows the involvement of the C=O moiety
in the binding of curcumin to the Au QC surface. The XPS spectra of
oxygen (O 1s) for curcumin was deconvoluted in two
peaks situated at 532.1 and 533.5 eV related to C–O and C=O,
respectively. One of these two peaks related to C–O for C-Au
QCs also got downshifted by 0.5 to 531.6 eV. This shows that oxygen
atoms of C=O and C–O of curcumin molecules are involved
in the binding to the Au QC surface. The XPS spectrum for Au 4f showed two broad peaks corresponding to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 (Figure 4). The deconvolution
of these peaks indicated the presence of Au in two oxidation states:
(a) Au(0) and (b) Au(I). Au 4f7/2 can
be deconvoluted in two peaks situated at ∼83.7 and ∼84.6
eV related to the presence of Au(0) and Au(I) oxidation states, respectively,
whereas the Au 4f5/2 peak was deconvoluted
in two peaks located at ∼87 and ∼88 eV, associated with
the presence of Au(0) and Au(I) oxidation state, respectively (Figure 4).66,67

QCs. XPS spectra a and c represent the C 1s core-level
electrons, whereas b and d represent the O 1s core-level
electrons and e represents the Au 4f core-level electrons.

To determine the composition of
C-Au QCs, electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis was performed. Most of the peaks
in the deconvoluted ESI-MS spectrum for C-Au QCs were found in between
2000 and 8000 Da. The spectrum shows many peaks, which may be due
to the synthesis of a mixed population of Au QCs (Figure S9). The ESI-MS measurement was also performed for
curcumin molecules to confirm their integrity and the mass peak distribution
profile (Figure S10). It was observed that
most of the peaks for curcumin molecules were in the region from 100
to 1400 Da, which shows that curcumin molecules do not have any contribution
to the spectrum of C-Au QCs. However, there are many other peaks in
the ESI-MS spectra of both curcumin and C-Au QCs which could not be
assigned because of the degradation of a small fraction of curcumin
molecules.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity to Normal and Cancer
Cells
To
determine the cytotoxic effect of curcumin, C-Au QCs, GSH-Au QCs,
and C-Au NPs, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was performed against the normal (NIH 3T3) and
cancer (MCF7) cell lines. For these experiments, the C-Au QCs concentration
was decided based on the amount of curcumin molecules loaded on the
C-Au QCs which was determined using UV−vis absorption measurements
(described in Experimental section). C-Au
NPs and GSH-Au QCs were synthesized to investigate the role of particle
size and surface ligands on the cell cytotoxicity, respectively. For
the sake of fare comparison, the concentration of C-Au NPs and GSH-Au
QCs was selected based on the Au content present in the C-Au QC sample,
which was determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical
emission spectrometry (ICP–OES).

The samples at different
concentrations were incubated with NIH 3T3 and MCF7 cells for 24 h
at 37 °C. The equivalent amount of free curcumin molecules was
found to be more cytotoxic to normal cells than C-Au QCs at the concentration
of 25 μg/mL (Figure 5a,b). Interestingly, the cytotoxicity of C-Au QCs to MCF7
cells was almost the same as curcumin up to the concentration of 25
μg/mL (Figure 5c,d). Figure 5e shows
the clear difference between the cell viability of normal and cancer
cells after the treatment with curcumin and C-Au QCs at different
concentrations. It can be easily seen from Figure 5f that curcumin shows ∼40 and ∼55%
cell death in comparison to C-Au QCs ∼14 and ∼57% for
normal and cancer cells, respectively, at the concentration of 25
μg/mL. These results indicate that curcumin is able to retain
its anticancer property with lesser normal cell cytotoxicity even
after conjugation with Au QCs. The probable reason behind the differential
cytotoxicity of C-Au QCs to the cancer cells may be due to the high
metabolism rate of cancer cells in comparison to normal cells, which
leads to the higher uptake of C-Au QCs to the cancer cells.

(NIH3T3) and cancer (MCF7) cell viabilities after
incubation of 24 h with curcumin (a,c) and C-Au QCs (b,d). (e) Comparison

(■) and C-Au QCs (●) at different concentrations. (f)
Comparison between normal and cancer cell death after treatment with
curcumin and C-Au QCs at the curcumin concentration of 25 μg/mL.
The normal and cancer cells were represented with green and red color,
respectively.

C-Au NPs and GSH-Au QCs
were found to be the almost noncytotoxic
to both the normal and cancer cells at the Au concentrations used
(Figure S11). C-Au NPs did not show cytotoxicity
to the cancer cells; this may be due to the fewer numbers of Au NPs
present in the sample, which also reduces the number of curcumin molecules
in comparison to C-Au QCs, for the same amount of Au present in the
sample. However, GSH-Au QCs did not show the cytotoxicity to both
normal and cancer cells may be due to the biocompatible nature of
GSH.

Mechanism behind the Cytotoxicity of C-Au QCs to the Cancer
Cells
To further determine the mechanism behind the cytotoxic
effect of C-Au QCs to the cancer cells, annexin V and propidium iodide
(PI) staining was done. The PI and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) double-positive cells show the apoptotic cells out of the total
cells analyzed by flow cytometry. The results revealed that MCF7 cells
treated with C-Au QCs showed ∼33.2% apoptotic and 12.4% preapoptotic
population. In total, almost around 50% of C-Au QC-treated cells have
undergone the apoptotic process leading to cell death (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Flow cytometric analysis
of MCF7 cells without (top layer) and
with C-Au QC treatment (bottom layer).

Later, western blot experiment for the C-Au QC-treated MCF7
cells
was carried out to evaluate the effect of C-Au QCs on the expression
of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic markers. The C-Au QC treatment resulted
in the increased expression of the proapoptotic protein such as cleaved
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) compared to the control cells (Figure 7). The presence of
cleaved PARP in the C-Au QC-treated cancer cells directly correlates
with the induction of apoptosis.31 Also,
the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as phosphor-AKT and
phosphor-STAT3, was significantly decreased in the treated cells compared
to the control cells, indicating that C-Au QCs induce apoptosis in
the cancer cells (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Western blot analysis of survival and proapototic proteins in breast
cancer MCF7 cells upon treatment with C-Au QCs. Curcumin was used
as the positive control and β-actin was used as the loading
control.

In Vivo Anticancer Study
on the Murine Xenograft Model
Because C-Au QCs inhibited
the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells
in vitro, it was stimulating to perform in vivo study using a murine
xenograft model to evaluate the inhibitory effect of C-Au QCs on tumor
growth. One week after the 1 × 106 MDA-MB 231 breast
cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank areas of
BALB/c SCID mice, C-Au QCs were injected intraperitoneally at a dosage
of 20 mg/kg thrice a week. Four weeks after the injection of MDA-MB
231 breast cancer cells, tumor size, tumor volume, and tumor weight
decreased significantly in the group treated with C-Au QCs when compared
to the control group (Figure 8).

Figure 8 C-Au QCs inhibit tumor growth in xenografts of MDA-MB 231 breast
cancer cells. (a) Size of MDA-MB 231 tumors; the mice were sacrificed
on day 30 and tumors were resected. (b) Tumor volume before (control)
and after the treatment with 20 mg/kg C-Au QCs. Tumor volume (mm3) after 30 days of treatment is shown. Data represent the
average of tumor volume. (c) Tumor weight after 30 days of C-Au QCs
treatment.

Most of the chemotherapeutic drugs
result in tissue damage in the
vital organs, which leads to the deterioration of the patient health.
Therefore, histopathological analysis was carried out for different
organs dissected from mice after 4 weeks of C-Au QC injections post
MDA-MB 231 tumor inoculation (Figure 9). The liver tissue sections from the C-Au QC-treated
mice showed a normal liver architecture, with well-preserved hepatocytes.
In addition, the tissue architecture and morphology of the mice liver
tissue section from the C-Au QC-treated mice were similar to the control
group. The lung sections from the control and C-Au QC-treated samples
were examined for alveolar congestion and intra-alveolar hemorrhage
to check their toxicity. No significant toxicity was observed in the
treated samples, and the morphology was almost similar to the control
group. Similarly, kidney and heart sections were analyzed for interstitial
edema and tissue damage in the control and C-Au QC-treated samples.
No pathological changes were observed in the C-Au QC-treated mice
compared to the control. These results suggest that C-Au QCs do not
show toxicity to the vital organs of mice.

Figure 9 Internal organs of mice
treated with C-Au QCs in the murine xenograft
model. After the mice were sacrificed on day 30, the liver, lung,
heart, and kidney were resected, fixed, and embedded in paraffin.
The samples were sliced to 5 μm in thickness and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin dyes (magnification 10×).

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized
C-Au QCs which have small size and high
curcumin loading capacity than their counterparts, that is, C-Au NPs,
for the same amount of gold content. Curcumin molecules, even after
conjugation to Au QCs, were observed to retain their cytotoxicity
to cancer cells while showing less cytotoxicity to the normal cells
in comparison to curcumin alone. Flow cytometry and western blot assay
confirm that C-Au QCs induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Further, in
vivo study showed that C-Au QCs were able to effectively decrease
the tumor size without producing any significant toxicity to the internal
organs. Therefore, we believe that C-Au QCs can be a promising candidate
for anticancer therapy because of their small size, high drug loading
capacity, low gold content, and low cytotoxicity.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All chemicals were of analytical grade and
used as-received without any further purification unless otherwise
mentioned. The benzoylated dialysis tube, curcumin, HAuCl4·3H2O, and DMSO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Thomas Baker. All glassware
were washed with aquaregia (HCl/HNO3 = 3:1) carefully and
rinsed with double distilled water (ddH2O) before using
them for synthesis.

Synthesis of Curcumin-Conjugated Au QCs
Briefly, 14.8
mg of curcumin was taken in a vial followed by the addition of 2 mL
of NaOH (0.1 M) with vigorous mixing for few seconds. Just after the
addition of NaOH, the color of the suspension changed to dark red
color. Immediately, 36 mL of ddH2O and 2 mL of HAuCl4 (10−2 M) were added sequentially, and the
solution was allowed to stir vigorously. The reaction suspension was
incubated at 27 °C for 24 h under constant stirring at 150 rpm
to complete the reaction process.

Purification of Curcumin-Conjugated
Au QCs
The as-obtained
suspension was centrifuged at 20 000g for
15 min at 0 °C temperature for the separation of Au QCs from
Au NPs. The as-obtained supernatant was collected and dialyzed for
almost 2 days while continuously washing by changing the water at
fixed time intervals of 6 h. The pore size cutoff of the benzoylated
dialysis tube was 2 kDa, which was able to separate the compounds
with a molecular weight of ≤1200 Da from the compounds with
a molecular weight of >2 kDa. Dialysis was performed to separate
the
unreacted molecules and ions from the Au QC suspension. After each
washing, the samples were collected for the quantification of unbound
curcumin molecules.

Quantification of Curcumin Molecules in the
Au QC Suspension
The quantification of curcumin molecules
in the Au QC suspension
was done by the following method. First, the UV–vis spectroscopic
studies were carried out on the dialyzates collected at various intervals.
The characteristic UV peak for curcumin was observed ∼265 nm
and assumed not to change on the binding of curcumin to the nanoparticle
surface and in the alkaline medium. Second, the different dilutions
of curcumin molecules in the alkaline medium were analyzed by UV–vis
spectroscopy, and then, plots were made between the absorbance and
the concentration. By this linear plot, the curcumin concentration
was analyzed in the Au QC suspension and in the dialyzate (Figure S1).

Synthesis of Curcumin-Conjugated
Au NPs
For the synthesis
of curcumin-conjugated Au NPs, the procedure mentioned by Yang et
al.25 has been followed with slight modifications.
Briefly, 500 μL of 20 mM curcumin solution was made in DMSO,
and then, 45 mL of water was added under constant stirring. The pH
of the solution was adjusted to alkaline by the addition of 100 μL
NaOH. The temperature of the solution was raised to 100 °C, and
HAuCl4 (2.5 mL, 10 mM) was added under vigorous stirring
for 1 h. After that the mixture was cooled down to room temperature.
The dialysis of the as-obtained nanoparticle suspension was performed
using a dialysis bag with the pore size of 12 kDa to remove all unreacted
impurities and small quantum clusters. The UV–vis spectroscopic
analysis of the dialyzate was done to make sure the complete removal
of unbound curcumin molecules.

Synthesis of GSH-Conjugated
Au QCs
Briefly, 5 mL of
10–2 M HAuCl4 and 10 mL of 10–2 M GSH were added in a round-bottom flask containing 30 mL of water
with vigorous stirring. Then, 100 μL of NaOH and 5 mL of 50
mM of NaBH4 were added sequentially. The entire solution
was heated at ∼70 °C for 12 h under vigorous stirring.
The dialysis of the as-obtained suspension was performed in a benzoylated
dialysis bag with the pore size ∼2 kDa to remove the unreacted
molecules, ions, and impurities.

In Vitro Studies
Cell Culture
The mouse embryo fibroblast cell line
(NIH3T3) and breast cancer cell line (MCF7) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) medium. The detailed procedure
is described in our previous article.68

Proliferation Assay
The in vitro cell viability was
assessed using MTT proliferation assay in NIH3T3 and MCF7 cells. The
cells were trypsinized and plated at a density ∼20 000
cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were treated
with varying concentrations of curcumin, curcumin-conjugated Au QCs
(C-Au QCs), GSH-conjugated Au QCs (GSH-Au QCs), and curcumin-conjugated
Au NPs (C-Au NPs); then, the cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h. After the treatment, the medium was removed
and 10 μL of MTT (10 mg/mL) and 90 μL of DMEM were added
in each well and further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The formazan
crystals were solubilized in isopropanol and the absorbance of MTT
was measured. More information about this procedure is given in our
previous article.68

Flow Cytometry
The quantitative measurement of MCF7
cell apoptosis was done by phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell
membrane with annexin V. The control cells without treatment and C-Au
QC-treated cells were studied. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized,
washed twice with precooled phosphate-buffered saline and incubated
with a binding buffer containing annexin V-FITC and PI (BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).
The apoptotic cells were defined as both PI positive and annexin V-FITC
positive.

Western Blot Analysis
Protein extract
from MCF7 cells
was obtained in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing
0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The same amount of samples was
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
transferred, and immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.05% TWEEN 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature.
Appropriate primary antibody was added followed by the incubation
of the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
rabbit antimouse and goat antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:4000)
(Bio-Rad) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the final
wash, the immunoreactive bands were detected on X-ray films by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific). Data was obtained from three
independent experiments.

In Vivo Studies
The groups of six,
6 weeks old female
BALB/c SCID mice received subcutaneous injections of 1 × 106 cells in the dorsal area in a volume of 100 μL. C-Au
QCs were injected intraperitoneally thrice a week and 7 days after
the injection of MDA-MB 231 lung cancer cells. Tumor volumes were
determined weekly for 6 weeks and calculated on the basis of tumor
width (x) and length (y): x2y/2, where x < y. The major organs (heart, liver, lung, and kidneys) were
harvested and fixed in 10% formalin solution, dehydrated, sliced into
5 μm sections, and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining.
This staining is widely used in histology where hematoxylin gives
deep blue-purple color to nucleic acid, whereas eosin provides pink
color to the proteins.69

Characterization
Techniques
The absorbance, photoluminescence,
and XPS spectra were recorded using a JASCO (model V570) spectrometer,
Cary Eclipse photoluminescence spectrophotometer, and VG Microtech
ESCA 3000 instrument, respectively. The TEM images of C-Au NPs, C-Au
QCs, and GSH-Au QCs were recorded using a Tecnai G-2 T20 transmission
electron microscope and a Tecnai F30 high-resolution transmission
electron microscope from FEI Inc., respectively. The detailed information
of the instruments and sample preparation is described in our previous
article.52 A PALS zeta potential analyzer
ver 3.54 (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation) was used to determine
the electrophoretic mobilities. The FTIR spectra were obtained using
a PerkinElmer Spectrum One instrument. The spectrometer was operated
in the % transmission mode at a resolution of 2 cm–1. To analyze the Au content in C-Au QCs, C-Au NPs, and GSH-Au QCs,
they were treated with aquaregia (10%), until the particles got dissolved,
and then, the final volume was adjusted to 10 mL with deionized water.
The Au contents in the samples were measured by ICP–OES spectrometry.
More information about the instrument and sample preparation can be
found in our previous article.70 The mass
spectra were collected using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer in the
negative ionization mode, controlled by Xcalibur software (Thermo
Scientific). The diluted samples were fractionated using an Accela
LC system connected to the Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific) and resolved by a Hypersil GOLD column (Thermo Scientific)
over a 10 min gradient (acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid)
with a flow rate of 350 μL min–1. The samples
were ionized by a heated electrospray ionization probe. The Orbitrap
was set to analyze the survey scans in the mass range m/z 100–2000 for curcumin and 1000–10 000
for C-Au QCs. The mass spectra were analyzed using the freeware, mMass
version 5.5 (Copyright 2005–2016 by Martin Strohalm).71
