The
usefulness of dried Dowex H+ cation-exchange resin
with or without sodium iodide (NaI) as a catalyst system for different
kinds of esterifications using carboxylic acids and alcohols as starting
materials has been systematically investigated. The Dowex H+/NaI approach is very effective, generally high yielding, energy-efficient,
and nontoxic, and the Dowex H+ resin is reusable. Since
the whole procedure from start to product isolation is also very simple,
these features make the method environmentally friendly. The method
is regioselective, and its potential for separation of valuable carboxylic
acids like resin acids from mixtures containing other kinds of carboxylic
acids has been demonstrated. Examples for green and straightforward
esterification of highly important natural amino acids are also presented.

Introduction
The German chemist,
Leopold Gmelin was perhaps the first person
to coin the term “ester” probably as a contraction of
the German Essigäther, “acetic ether”.1 In those days, esters were also called oxy-acid
ethers. Generally, esters are compounds derived from acid (organic
or inorganic) and alcohol.2 Triglycerides,
i.e., esters of fatty acids and glycerol, are one of the main classes
of lipids and important compounds in biology since animal fats and
vegetable oils are mainly triglycerides.3 Polyesters are very important compounds found naturally, e.g., in
the cuticle of plants to protect leaves, and their synthetic counterparts
are the plastics used in bottles, resins, clothing, etc.4,5 Many esters have a pleasant “sweet” odor, and they
occur naturally in fruits and plants: isoamyl acetate (pear, banana),
ethyl hexanoate (pineapple), octyl acetate (orange), and methyl butyrate
(apple).6,7 Esters are also used as solvents by the
chemical industry, e.g., ethyl acetate is a common solvent with an
annual global production of over 3.5 million tons in 2015.8 DNA and RNA structures contain phosphodiester
bonds in their structures. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration
to state that esters are crucial for life on Earth.9

There are numerous methods for the preparation of
esters published
in the literature. The most common and best known is the Fischer esterification,
which is a reversible acid-catalyzed condensation reaction (see Scheme 1), but there are
many irreversible reactions catalyzed by one or more catalysts, such
as the Mitsunobu [activation by triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and diethyl azodicarboxylate] and Steglich [activation by carbodiimides
like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and dimethylaminopyridine] esterifications.10 Even though the literature is replete with methods
for esterifications, novel approaches have been reported recently.
Here are only a few examples: synthesis of ethyl lactate,11 aryl carboxylates,12 vinyl ether-containing esters,13 and
lipase-catalyzed alkyl valerates.14 In
addition, the use of triphenylphosphine oxide and oxalyl chloride
[(COCl)2] coupling reagents to achieve esterification at
room temperature has been reported as a novel method.15

Scheme 1 Esterification Methods
Generally, perhaps one of the easiest ways to prepare
esters is
the use of alcohol and a more reactive carboxylic anhydride or halogenide
instead of acids (see Scheme 1). These reactions are simple, high yielding, and mostly performed
without any special catalysts; however, in most cases, a hydrogen
halogenide (commonly HCl gas) scavenger is needed if carboxylic acid
halogenide (most common is carboxylic acid chloride) is used.10 From the point of view of the environment, the
best way to prepare esters would be the case presented also in Scheme 1, which is pretty
close to the method we present in this paper. The use of only carboxylic
acids and alcohols as starting materials instead of anhydrides or
halogenides would be the ideal “green” procedure because,
as generally known, acids and alcohols are so ubiquitous that they
can be considered as “natural” compounds. Carboxylic
acid anhydrides and halogenides (mostly chlorides) need to be prepared
chemically (condensation of carboxylic acids to anhydrides or halogenation
to halogenide) and that requires energy, catalyst(s), halogen source
(like thionyl chloride, SOCl2), which is usually toxic,
solvents, etc., i.e., these are not environmentally friendly compounds.10 Thus, we have several fundamental problems to
be resolved, such as global warming and plastic exposure; micro- and
nanoplastics can be found almost everywhere around the planet.16,17 It is evident that we need improved and more energy-efficient and
environmentally friendly methods to prepare chemical compounds even
if they are prepared on a small scale, according to the motto “great
oaks from little acorns grow”.

In 2015, we published
a “proof-of-concept” paper
entitled, “A powerful tool for acid-catalyzed organic addition
and substitution reactions”, where we presented how extremely
useful “tool” oven-dried Dowex H+ cation-exchange
resin with NaI is.18 By adopting the Dowex
H+/NaI approach, one can prepare compounds like tertiary
iodides, ethers, esters (also using R–CN as the acyl source
and dimethylformamide as the formate source), biodiesel from used
cooking oil (transesterification process), straight substitution of
R–OH to R–I, cyclic ethers can be opened to useful building
blocks,19 iodine can be added to a compound
with a triple bond to form an iodinated double bond, etc. (see refs18, 19). As mentioned, the method used in those
papers is based on the use of oven-dried Dowex H+ cation-exchange
resin with NaX (X = I or Br). It is known that Dowex-type H+ cation-exchange resins can be used as solid catalysts in esterification
reactions;20−22 however, as far as we are aware, there are very few
publications where the oven-dried Dowex H+ resin has been
used by itself for esterifications, and no reports where it has been
used with NaI. Here, we will present systematically how extremely
useful and effective the dried Dowex H+/NaI approach is
for esterification reactions and why the method can be considered
as a green chemistry tool/method. In this paper, we will present several
examples of how dried Dowex H+ can be used effectively
with or (in some cases) without NaI in the synthesis of very sterically
hindered esters using only carboxylic acids and alcohols as starting
materials under relatively mild conditions, and in addition, examples
of regioselective esterifications will be presented. In most of the
cases, the isolation of the produced esters was very simple with no
further purifications needed. Examples of the esterification of highly
important natural amino acids will also be presented.

It can
be proposed that Dowex H+ cation-exchange resin
is commonly used in all chemistry laboratories throughout the world,
and therefore, it is widely available. The background describing how
we initially discovered its potential for use in various chemical
reactions can be found elsewhere.18 Briefly,
Dowex H+ needs to be dried before use (at 120 °C in
oven for around 18–20 h; see Figure 1), which makes it far more effective than
undried resin (moisture content of regular Dowex H+ cation-exchange
resin may be over 50%). In fact, the best way to make it as effective
as possible is first to treat Dowex H+ with 2 M HCl, then
wash several times with distilled water, and finally dry it (more
detailed procedure can be found in Experimental Section).

(right) drying in oven at 120 °C overnight.

Results and Discussion
In Table 1, we have
collected 18 examples for the preparation of esters starting from
carboxylic acids, and in Table 2, we have presented six examples of acylation of selected
alcohols by using dried Dowex H+ cation-exchange resin
with or, in some cases (seven examples), without dried NaI. Tables 1 and 2 also describe the reaction conditions used (temperature and
reaction time); detailed reaction conditions and isolation procedures
can be found in Experimental Section.

One of the most interesting
starting materials for esterification
experiments presented here was tropic acid (1), which
is a precursor of a very important natural compound atropine (48; see Figure 2). Atropine (48) can be extracted from some plants like Atropa belladonna; it is an antagonist of the muscarinic
cholinergic receptors, so it has a broad range of medical applications.
Atropine (48) is also used as an antidote for poisoning
from nerve gases (such as sarin and VX) and organophosphate insecticides.23 In addition to being an important precursor
of atropine (48), tropic acid (1) is an
attractive compound having a sterically hindered secondary carboxylic
acid group and a hydroxyl group (even though this is a primary one,
it has a bulky phenyl and carboxylic acid group in the β-carbon)
in the same molecule. Four different derivatives of tropic acid (1) were prepared: two esters (22 and 23; see Table 1) and
two acylated compounds (41 and 42; see Table 2).

Figure 2 Chemical structure of
atropine (48).

Interestingly, according to SciFinder search, only eight
examples
of ways to prepare tropic acid methyl ester (22) from
tropic acid (1) have been reported with poor yields (<20%)
or yields not even reported at all, and most of the esterifications
were performed by basic Fischer esterification catalyzed by sulfuric
acid.24 There is one paper that describes
the synthesis of tropic acid isopropyl ester (23) by
chlorination of carboxylic acid group using thionyl chloride; however,
yield was not mentioned.25 As can be seen
in Table 1, by using
our method, the isolated yields of tropic acid methyl (22) and isopropyl (23) esters were 83 and 72%, respectively,
much higher than in the earlier reports. Only three examples to prepare
acetylated tropic acid (41) from tropic acid (1) were found in the literature, according to SciFinder search, all
utilizing acetyl chloride.26 The isobutyl
derivative (42) was totally unknown. By adopting the
Dowex H+/NaI approach with tropic acid (1)
and acetic or isobutyric acid, 99 and 44% isolated yields (99 and
88% conversions; see Table 2) were achieved for compounds 41 and 42, respectively.

The usefulness of the Dowex H+/NaI
method for esterifications
of benzoic acid (2) and its 4-hydroxy (3) and 2-hydroxy (4, salicylic acid) derivatives was
also tested. Methyl benzoate (24) was produced with a
high isolated yield (82%) by refluxing 2 for 24 h in
MeOH. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid ethyl ester (25) was isolated
with a reasonable yield (51%); however, to achieve 91% conversion
of 3 to 25, the reaction was refluxed for
72 h in EtOH. Only 50% conversion of salicylic acid (4) to its ethyl ester (26) was observed under the same
conditions as for the synthesis of 25. One can clearly
discern the inactivation effect of the presence of a hydroxy group
in the 2-position versus 4-position of the benzene ring for the synthesis
of compounds 25 and 26 because the conversions
were 91 and 50%, respectively, under the same conditions.

We
describe many examples of organic acids with different kinds
of functional groups (5–10) to emphasize
how effectively they can be esterified to compounds 27–32 by the Dowex H+/NaI approach under
very mild reaction conditions, mostly by stirring at room temperature
for 2–4 h [compound 32, which is an ethyl ester,
not a methyl like the other compounds (27–31), needed stirring at 65 °C for 4 h to achieve 99%
conversion]. Methyl hex-5-ynoate (28) was stirred for
24 h to achieve 100% conversion (75% isolated yield); however, the
synthesis was performed without NaI, so it was not unexpected that
the time to reach 100% conversion would be longer. The reason why
we tested the synthesis of 28 without NaI is the possibility
of an addition reaction to the triple bond, which we have reported
elsewhere.18 This seems to happen even
at room temperature, i.e., we observed this side reaction according
to the 1H NMR spectrum in synthesis experiments to produce 28 with NaI after stirring for 24 h. Full 100% conversion
of 6 to 28 can be achieved also with a catalytic
amount of NaI (0.1 equiv) at room temperature with 4 h stirring; however,
due to the slightly different isolation procedure, the isolated yield
was 66% instead of 75%, with the procedure lacking NaI. We were not
able to isolate compound 29 because of the previously
observed co-evaporation with MeOH in the isolation procedure. It was
also quite difficult to isolate compound 30 for the same
reasons; however, we were able to obtain a 40% yield.

Malic
acid (11) was chosen to be one of the starting
materials in our esterification experiments because it is a dicarboxylic
acid and it has two different kinds of carboxylic acid groups, primary
and secondary. The dimethyl ester of malic acid (33)
was effectively synthesized by stirring at room temperature for 24
h.

Amino acids are very important compounds for all life on
Earth,
but in addition, their structures were very interesting for the esterification
experiments presented here because of α-amino groups and different
side chains.27 We selected four different
kinds of amino acids (as their hydrochloride salts, 12–15) for esterification experiments with the
Dowex H+/NaI approach. According to a SciFinder search,
by far the most commonly reported method to prepare compounds 34–37 has been the use of thionyl chloride
to synthesize the acid chloride, followed by the addition of methanol,
which is not an environmentally friendly approach. Surprisingly, very
little attention has been paid to preparing amino acid methyl esters
(34–37) from the corresponding amino
acid hydrochlorides (12–15), and
only 17 examples were found in the literature. We were able to prepare
compounds 34–37 from 12–15 by using only dried Dowex H+ as
the catalyst (see reaction conditions in Table 1). The isolation of the products was extremely
straightforward: only filtration and evaporation were needed and high
yields (70–82%) were acquired to compounds 34–37 (see detailed procedures in Experimental
Section). The method reported here is a new, green, and straightforward
way to prepare amino acid esters 34–37, and most probably it can be applied to other amino acids as well.

There were several reasons why citric acid (16) and
iso-citric acid trisodium salt hydrate (17) were selected
as starting materials for the esterification experiments with the
Dowex H+/NaI method: (1) they are tricarboxylic acids;
citric acid (16) has two primary carboxylic acid groups
and one tertiary carboxylic acid group, and iso-citric acid trisodium
salt hydrate (17) has one primary and two secondary carboxylic
acid groups; (2) both are very important compounds and part of the
citric acid cycle28 to release stored energy
by all aerobic organisms; (3) citric acid triethyl ester (38) is an important precursor in the synthesis of phosphocitric acid,
which is a naturally occurring biomolecule found in cells;29 (4) iso-citric acid triethyl ester (39) will become an important precursor for the synthesis of phospho-iso-citric
acid, which has not yet been reported in the literature and it is
not commercially available. The triethyl ester of citric acid (38) was prepared and isolated with quantitative yield (97%
isolated yield; see Table 1) by refluxing compound 16 for 24 h in EtOH.
The isolated yield for triethyl ester of iso-citric acid (39) was rather low (29%); however, the procedure was very straightforward
because we could use directly the commercially available salt form
of isocitrate (17) with no need to first convert the
salt to the acid. Actually, for our needs, the 29% yield was more
than sufficient, so the optimization of the procedure did not seem
necessary. It should be noted that, according to the 1H
NMR spectrum measured from the sample taken in the reaction mixture
of 39, we were able to detect a mixture of triethyl ester
(39) and diethyl esters of iso-citric acid. The presence
of these other compounds and the isolation procedure of 39 (see Experimental Section) were the main
reasons for the low isolated yield (29%).

As mentioned earlier,
in Table 2, we have
collected six examples of acylation of selected
compounds by using the method reported here. Compounds 41 and 42 have been discussed earlier in the text, and
compound 40 is an example of the esterification of benzyl
alcohol using only dried Dowex H+ without NaI at 80 °C
for 24 h. Under those conditions, a high isolated yield (85%) was
achieved.

Mandelic acid (19) is an important compound,
e.g.,
used as a precursor, in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.30 It has a hindered secondary hydroxyl group,
which made it a valuable compound for our esterification experiments.
In the literature, only two chemical methods to prepare acetylated
mandelic acid (43) from 19 and acetic acid
were found, catalyzed by zinc chloride31 or silica sulfuric acid32 with 72 and
92% reported yields, respectively. In the case when silica sulfuric
acid was used as the catalyst, neither the experimental procedure
nor the isolation procedure were reported, also NMR characterization
data were missing. In our experiment, the acetylated mandelic acid
(43) was produced at 90 °C after a 24 h reaction
time with a rather good isolated yield (55%; 81% conversion was observed).
This is a good alternative to these previously reported methods and
demonstrates well that the Dowex H+/NaI approach is effective
and useful also when highly steric ester structures need to be prepared
using only alcohols and carboxylic acids as starting materials.

In the preparation of octyl acetate (44) and but-3-en-1-yl
acetate (45), we decided to test how effective the Dowex
H+/NaI method would be if only 2 equiv of acetic acid (compared
to alcohols 20 and 21) were used in the
reactions with no solvent and which temperature and reaction time
would be optimal for good yields. Surprisingly, at 55 °C with
a reaction time of 2 h, 97% conversion of octanol (20) to octyl acetate (44) was observed and a high isolated
yield (83%) was achieved. After the reaction at the same 55 °C
temperature for 18 h reaction time, but-3-en-1-yl acetate (45) was isolated with a reasonable yield (52%). In the isolation of 45, we did not use any solvents, so the synthesis and isolation
of 45 can be considered a very green procedure. According
to a SciFinder search, there are only 18 references that are related
to the synthesis of 45 from 21 using acetic
acid as the acetylation reagent, 16 of which are patents. Perhaps
the closest method to ours was catalyzed by sulfuric acid under the
following conditions: 10 equiv acetic acid, 60 °C, 1 h; 72% isolated
yield was reported.33 But-3-en-1-yl acetate
(45) is a very important precursor in the synthesis of
pheromones.33

According to the results
reported in Tables 1 and 2, we decided
to conduct some experiments to clarify the selectivity of the Dowex
H+/NaI method in esterification reactions. Mixtures (1:1)
of phenol with octanol or isopropanol or cyclohexanol were reacted
with 10 equiv of acetic acid under the conditions reported in Scheme 2. All aliphatic alcohols
were converted (100%) to their acetates over phenol. We also tested
the combination of phenol, octanol, and cyclohexanol (1:1:1) under
the same conditions at room temperature to determine if there was
any selectivity of octanol over cyclohexanol; however, both were converted
to their acetates (>95%).

Scheme 2 Selective Acetylation of Studied Alcohols
(R = Octyl, Pri, Cyclohexyl) in the Presence of Phenol
Selective synthesis of citric
acid dimethyl ester (46) starting from citric acid (16) with 60% isolated yield
was obtained (see Scheme 3). The whole synthesis procedure with isolation was rather
straightforward, as shown in Experimental Section. There are only a few reports in the literature to prepare compound 46: one method is based on boric or boronic acid catalyzation,34 and the other utilizes a Fischer esterification
procedure and sulfuric acid catalyzation with 32% isolated yield;35 another paper reported a 35% yield,36 although with rather complicated isolation procedures
compared to our method. We also conducted a straightforward test with
benzoic acid (2) and phenylacetic acid (5) in the same pot; after 1.5 h stirring at room temperature, the
conversion of 5 to 27 was observed to be
100% and benzoic acid did not react at all; so we separated and isolated
both compounds (see Scheme 4 and the detailed procedure in Experimental
Section). This is not a surprise since the same kind of experiment
has been described in the literature but with Amberlyst 15 as the
catalyst.37 Nonetheless, this is an example
demonstrating that it is possible to use the Dowex H+/NaI
method for esterification of less hindered carboxylic acids and separate
them and then proceed with esterification of more hindered carboxylic
acids like benzoic acid (2) or its derivatives at elevated
temperatures (see Table 1; preparation of compounds 24–26).

Scheme 3 Selective Synthesis of Citric Acid Dimethyl Ester
Scheme 4 Selective Esterification of Phenylacetic
Acid (5) over
Benzoic Acid (2)
For the reasons mentioned earlier, dl-malic acid
(11) was considered an interesting compound for selective
esterification
experiments. Malic acid is an important compound in biochemistry,
produced by all living organisms, and it is part of the earlier mentioned
citric acid cycle;28 it also confers the
sour taste to fruits.38 Only one report
for the synthesis of malic acid mono methyl ester (47) was found in the literature using enzymatic hydrolysis of dimethyl
malic acid39 (33), and therefore,
this is the first chemical synthesis of 47 reported so
far in the literature. The best and most adequate isolated yield (45%)
was achieved when 500 mg of 11 was stirred with 500 mg
of dried Dowex H+ resin without NaI for 2 h at room temperature
(see Scheme 5). The
final product 47 could be readily separated from mixture
containing diester 33 by crystallization (detailed procedure
can be found in Experimental Section).

Scheme 5 Selective Synthesis of Malic Acid Monomethyl Ester
The effect of NaI in the reactions can be clearly
seen in the results
collected in Table 3. The effect is much greater when preparing more steric esters (e.g., 42) compared to their nonsteric counterparts (e.g., 44). In addition, in the case of methyl benzoate (24), the use of 0.5 equiv of NaI instead 0.1 equiv gave better conversion,
92 and 83%, respectively. This was not the case with compound 42; these results can be seen in Table 4 and will be discussed later. As a comparison,
sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalysis to prepare compounds 24 and 44 was tested and achieved conversions
were rather similar to those with esterifications with the Dowex H+/NaI method.

We also
tested the effect of the amount of NaI used in the synthesis
of the highly steric ester 42; the results are collected
in Table 4. The best
conversion (74%) was achieved with 0.1 equiv of NaI; more NaI or its
absence gave lower conversions. In fact, the amounts of NaI used in
the esterification reactions reported in this paper have not been
optimized, and according to the above result, it might be reasonable
to test the optimal amount of NaI on a case-by-case basis to achieve
the best conversion.

Last but not least, we decided to test
how effective and selective
the Dowex H+/NaI method would be in the separation of valuable
resin acids (50; see the general structure in Figure 3) from a real tall
oil sample.40 Tall oil is a commercially
valuable byproduct of softwood (pine or spruce) from pulp production
with more than 1.6 M tonnes being produced annually. The major components
of tall oil are unsaturated fatty acids and the more valuable resin
acids (50), which are used in many industrial and consumer
products. On an industrial scale, fatty acid components of the tall
oil are separated from resin acids by high vacuum distillation.41 However, the complete separation of the components
by distillation methods is difficult and not energy-efficient. Tall
oil esterification by the method described here, followed by extraction,
leads to quantitative separation of fatty acid methyl esters (see Scheme 6). The tertiary resin
acids (50) remain intact in our method and are recovered
from the process at a high yield (see procedure in Experimental Section).

Figure 3 General structure of resin acids (50).

Scheme 6 Separation of Valuable
Resin Acids (50, Part of the
Diterpene Structure Omitted) in Mixture Containing Fatty Acids (49)
The exact reaction
mechanism is unclear, but the most probable
mechanism for unhindered esters follows the traditional proton-catalyzed
esterification mechanism. In this case, the H+ form solid
resin is an excellent proton donor and carbonyl oxygen (C=O)
is protonated, the nucleophilic alcohol attacks the positively charged
carbon, and water is eliminated yielding the ester (e.g., see Table 3 product 24). In the case of hindered esters (see Table 4), the mechanism is the formation of R–I
from R–OH and NaI in the presence of H+ from Dowex
and/or the formation of HI, which is a better proton donor than Dowex
since 19 and 74% conversions were obtained without and with 0.1 equiv
of NaI, respectively. Generally, substitution of alcohol group to
iodine requires either activation of OH group or elevated temperatures.18,42 In the previous paper,18 we have demonstrated
and discussed the formation of HI based on an addition reaction to
the double bond. At least under elevated temperatures, the R–I-based
mechanism might be possible.

Conclusions
The study clearly and
unambiguously highlights the straightforward
nature of these kinds of synthetic procedures, and usually products
can be isolated without any further purifications (except two compounds, 42 and 43, which required column chromatography
purifications) using only carboxylic acids and alcohols as starting
materials. Our method can be compared to the basic Fisher esterification,
e.g., as catalyzed by sulfuric acid; however, the product isolation
by using our method seems to be simpler than in Fischer esterifications
(e.g., isolation of 34–37) and no
side reactions were observed under the conditions used; with sulfuric
acid, side reactions are possible at least with unsaturated starting
materials.18 Generally, our conditions
were mild, of course some elevated temperatures were needed in reactions
when very steric esters like 42 and 43 were
prepared or starting materials had unreactive or steric groups like 2 and 16. We have demonstrated that the dried
Dowex H+/NaI approach can be used for selective esterifications
and there is clear evidence that NaI reduces the reaction energy needed
in the esterification reactions, and in particular, it improves conversions
when steric esters need to prepared; however, the amount of NaI may
need to be determined on a test case-by-case basis to achieve the
best results, as shown in Table 4. In the experiments of the esterification of amino
acids 12–15, which were the last
products we made, we showed that a sufficient amount of dried Dowex
H+ was only 50 mg (for diacid 35, more, i.e.,
75 mg was needed) vs 100 mg of starting material (0.5:1 mass ratio)
and the corresponding esters (34–37) were synthesized without NaI and isolated so simply that it could
be used for industrial purposes (see procedures in Experimental Section) with high yields (70–82%). We
have also demonstrated how extremely useful the dried Dowex H+/NaI method is in the separation and isolation of highly valuable
resin acids (50) from the mixture of acids (see Scheme 6). The reusability
of Dowex H+ resin was tested for the synthesis of 27 and 28. In both cases, Dowex H+ resin was collected and reused two times (used for three times total),
leading to ca. 100% conversion in all three times according to the 1H spectra (see the detailed procedure in Experimental Section).

And finally, in a nutshell, the
presented method/procedure is extremely
simple, very effective, and nontoxic, and Dowex H+ resin
is regenerable,18 reusable, and energy-efficient,
which make it a green approach.

Experimental Section
General
1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a 600 MHz spectrometer operating at 600.2 and 150.9
MHz, respectively. The solvent residual peak was used as a standard
for 1H and 13C measurements in CDCl3 and CD3OD (7.26 or 77.16 ppm for CDCl3 and
3.31 or 49.00 ppm for CD3OD, respectively),43 in D2O 4.79 ppm in 1H
measurements and added CD3OD in the 13C measurements
(49.00 ppm). The nJHH couplings
were calculated from the proton spectra, and all J values are given in Hz. Appropriate two-dimensional NMR measurements
were performed to confirm structures when needed. Mass spectra were
recorded on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer using electrospray
ionization (ESI) with positive ionization mode for totally novel compound 42 and also for compounds 23, 39, and 47 (compounds for which chemical syntheses were
not found in the literature). The purity of the products was determined
from 1H spectrum and was ≥95% unless stated otherwise.

Preparation
of But-3-en-1-yl Acetate (45)
3-Buten-1-ol (1.0
mL, 843 mg, 11.69 mmol), glacial acetic acid (1.35
mL, 1.42 g, 23.58 mmol, 2.0 equiv), dried Dowex 50W-X8 ion-exchange
resin (H+-form, 350 mg), and dried NaI (75 mg, 0.50 mmol,
0.05 equiv) were stirred overnight (ca. 18 h) at 55 °C before
Dowex was collected after filtration, and the reaction mixture was
moved to a separation funnel. The reaction mixture was washed with
saturated NaHCO3 (2–3 mL), the water layer (lower
layer) was removed, and the ester phase was washed with a very small
portion of 10% Na2S2O3 (sodium thiosulfate)
and dried over MgSO4. But-3-en-1-yl acetate (698 mg, 52%)
was obtained as a slightly yellow liquid. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 5.82–5.74 (m, 1H), 5.14–5.05 (m,
2H), 4.12 (t, 2H, 3JHH = 6.8),

Preparation
of 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4-oxobutanoic
Acid (Dimethyl Citrate) (46)
Citric acid (200
mg, 1.04 mmol), dried NaI (48 mg, 0.32 mmol, 0.3 equiv), dried Dowex
50W-X8 ion-exchange resin (H+-form, 300 mg), and MeOH (3
mL) were stirred for 24 h at room temperature before Dowex was collected
after filtration and washed with MeOH, and the reaction mixture was
evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The solid residue was stirred in DCM
(4 mL) for 2 h before centrifugation. Liquids were removed and the
treatment was repeated once. Solids were dried in vacuo. Dimethyl
citrate (138 mg, 60%) was obtained as a white powder. Mp 115–116
°C. 1H NMR (CDCl3): 3.67 (s, 6H), 2.97–2.93
(m, 2H), 2.84–2.80 (m, 2H). 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 176.6, 172.1 (2C), 74.3, 52.5 (2C), 44.1 (2C).

Example of
the Selective Acetylation of Cyclohexanol over Phenol
Cyclohexanol
(110 μL, 106 mg, 1.06 mmol, 1 equiv), phenol
(100 mg, 1.06 mmol, 1 equiv), glacial acetic acid (610 μL, 640
mg, 10.66 mmol, 10 equiv), dried Dowex 50W-X8 ion-exchange resin (H+-form, 200 mg), and dried NaI (16 mg, 0.11 mmol, 0.1 equiv)
were stirred for 24 h at 50 °C. An NMR sample was taken from
the reaction mixture, and 100% conversion of cyclohexanol to acetylated
cyclohexanol was observed according to the 1H NMR spectrum
(phenol conversion was 0%). 1H NMR (CDCl3):
δ 4.77–4.71 (m, 1H), 2.04 (s, 3H), 1.88–1.81 (m,
2H), 1.75–1.68 (m, 2H), 1.57–1.51 (m, 1H), 1.44–1.31
(m, 4H), 1.28–1.20 (m, 1H).

Preparation of 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-4-oxobutanoic
Acid (Malic
Acid Monomethyl Ester, 47)
dl-Malic
acid (500 mg, 3.73 mmol), dried Dowex 50W-X8 ion-exchange resin (H+-form, 500 mg), and MeOH (5 mL) were stirred for 2 h at room
temperature before Dowex was collected after filtration and washed
with MeOH, and the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo.
Residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (3 mL) and added to a glass
column filled with silica gel (2 cm diameter, 15 cm high) and eluted
with 75 mL of ethyl acetate (this was done to remove unreacted starting
material dl-malic acid from reaction mixture). Ethyl acetate
was removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in chloroform (5
mL) and placed in the freezer overnight. The formed crystals were
separated and dried in vacuo. 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxy-4-oxobutanoic acid
(249 mg, 40%) was obtained as a white solid. Mp 76–77 °C. 1H NMR (CD3OD): δ 4.52–4.48 (m, 1H),
3.74 (s, 3H), 2.80–2.75 (m, 1H), 2.69–2.64 (m, 1H). 13C NMR (CD3OD): δ 175.2, 173.9, 68.6, 52.6,

Example
of the Selective Esterification of Phenylacetic Acid
over Benzoic Acid and Their Isolation from the Reaction Mixture
Phenylacetic acid (100 mg, 0.73 mmol), benzoic acid (100 mg, 0.82
mmol), dried NaI (25 mg, 0.17 mmol), dried Dowex 50W-X8 ion-exchange
resin (H+-form, 300 mg), and dried MeOH (3 mL) were stirred
for 1.5 h at r.t. before Dowex was collected after filtration and
washed with MeOH, and the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness
in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in diethyl ether (5 mL), washed
twice with 10% NaHCO3 (2 × 5 mL) and 10% Na2S2O3 (sodium thiosulfate, 0.5 mL), dried over
MgSO4, and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Methyl 2-phenylacetate
(59 mg, 54%) was obtained as a colorless liquid. The combined NaHCO3 phases were carefully acidified with 2 M HCl (strong release
of gases!) and extracted twice with diethyl ether (2 × 5 mL).
The combined diethyl ether phases were dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. Benzoic acid was obtained as
a white solid. Methyl 2-phenylacetate: 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 7.36–7.31 (m, 2H), 7.30–7.25 (m,
3H), 3.69 (s, 3H), 3.63 (s, 2H). Benzoic acid: 8.15–8.10 (m,
2H), 7.65–7.60 (m, 1H), 7.52–7.45 (m, 2H).

Example of
the Selective Esterification of Fatty Acids (49) over
Resin Acids (50) and Their Isolation
from the Reaction Mixture
Prepurified, methanol-treated pine
wood extract (40 g), dried NaI (2 g, 13 mmol), dried Dowex 50W-X8
ion-exchange resin (H+-form, 2.2 g), and dry MeOH (80 mL)
were stirred at room temperature for 18 h before Dowex was collected
after filtration and washed with MeOH, and the reaction mixture was
evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The oily product was made basic with
1 M NaOH and washed three times with EtOAc (70 mL) to remove unsaturated
fatty acid methyl esters. The remaining oily phase was acidified with
3 M HCl and extracted three times with EtOAc (50 mL). The organic
fraction was evaporated in vacuo yielding a 31 g mixture of resin
acids for further use (see the NMR spectra in the Supporting Information on pages S6–S7).

Dowex H+ Resin Handling in the Reusable Experiments
Dowex
was collected by a Bühner funnel, washed with a large
volume of MeOH, and dried in an oven for 1 h at 120 °C before
reuse in the synthesis of 27 and 28.
