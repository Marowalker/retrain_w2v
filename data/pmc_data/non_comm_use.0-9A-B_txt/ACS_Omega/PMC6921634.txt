It has been shown that yttria-stabilized zirconia is
an effective
catalyst for ethanol to n-butanol Guerbet coupling.
The variation of the calcination temperature allows an improvement
in the catalytic characteristics of this material via stabilization
of the tetragonal phase of zirconia, having higher basicity than the
monoclinic one. The treatment of yttria-stabilized zirconia at an
optimal calcination temperature of 500 °C induces the increase
in surface basicity required for the aldol condensation step, along
with a decrease in surface acidity, which is responsible for the side
reaction such as ethylene formation. The catalyst obtained significantly
exceeds in selectivity and n-butanol yield than individual
zirconia and other oxide systems which have been studied in this reaction.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The valorization of bioethanol
into value-added chemicals, such
as n-butanol, has been of particular industrial interest
over the last decades.1n-Butanol is mainly used in the production of paints, solvents, and
plasticizers and can be applied as a fuel additive or as a promising
alternative to gasoline.2 The catalytic
transformation of ethanol to n-butanol occurs via
the Guerbet coupling reaction which consists of doubling of alcohol
chain with the release of water.3

This process can be performed in two main ways: the vapor phase
under atmospheric pressure using bifunctional catalysts in flow and
the liquid phase in an autoclave under pressure up to 20 MPa over
metal–organic catalysts along with a liquid base.4 The main disadvantages of a liquid-phase reaction
are the expensive separation section, requirement for noble metal
catalysts, and frequency of action. Realization of the vapor-phase
condensation flow system opens new routes for industrial production
of n-butanol from bioethanol and also requires heterogeneous
acid–base catalysts, which can be easily separated from the
reaction mixture, exhibiting long catalytic lifetimes and facilitating
continuous operation in a fixed catalyst bed.5

Various catalysts have been investigated for this purpose,
including
basic zeolites, hydroxyapatite (HAP), mixed oxides, and individual
oxides like MgO, CaO, BaO, and Al2O3.6 Tsuchida et al.7 studied
ethanol coupling over HAP at 300 °C and atmospheric pressure
(0.1 MPa). They achieved 14.7% conversion and 11.2% yield at 1.78
s contact time in a flow reactor. Ogo et al.8 improved the n-butanol selectivity up to 86.4%
by replacing Ca with Sr in HAPs, whereas conversion 11.3% and yield
9.8% at 300 °C and 0.1 MPa remained relatively low. Carvalho
et al.9 using a Mg–Al mixed oxide
catalyst at 350 °C and 0.1 MPa achieved BuOH formation with conversion
35% and yield 14%. Ndou et al.10 reported
that MgO showed the highest yield of n-butanol among
the studied oxide catalysts (MgO, CaO, BaO, and Al2O3) with conversion 56.1% and yield 18.4% at 450 °C and
under atmospheric pressure.

According to the Guerbet reaction
mechanism, acidic and basic properties
of the catalysts are equally important.11 In recent years, zirconium oxide and its stabilized forms have received
attention as active catalysts in acid–base heterogeneous catalytic
processes, including Guerbet condensation, due to the tunable bifunctional
acid–base properties.12−15 However, it turned out that zirconia is not an effective
catalyst for the ethanol-to-butanol conversion because dehydration
to ethylene occurs much more readily than dehydrogenation to ethanal.
It has been found that the presence of a strong Lewis surface acidity
of ZrO2 directs the alcohol conversion process toward the
hydrocarbon formation.16 Partial neutralization
of these sites by sodium additives14,17 or modification
of ZrO2 with basic oxides18 increased
the selectivity toward coupling products but decreased the productivity
due to an increase in the surface coverage by adsorbed intermediates.17,18

Meanwhile, another possible tool for controlling the acid–base
properties of zirconium oxide is the phase composition because it
was shown that various crystalline modifications of zirconia differ
in acid–base characteristics. It was found that tetragonal
ZrO2 is characterized by higher basicity than the stable
monoclinic phase.19 This leads to differences
in the catalytic activity of ZrO2 with different phase
compositions. In particular, we observed such an effect when studying
the methanol carboxylation over zirconia catalysts calcined at different
temperatures.20 It was also confirmed for
the Guerbet coupling over ZrO2–CeO2 compositions,
wherein the ceria additive served as a stabilizer for the tetragonal
ZrO2.21

Materials with
the metastable phases of ZrO2, which
are stabilized by the addition of rare earth elements are well-known.
Moreover, yttria is the most commonly used additive to stabilize the
tetragonal or cubic phase of zirconia.22,23 Because of
a number of valuable physical properties such as high strength and
resilience; chemical stability; high melting point; and ionic, electrical,
and optical properties, yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is an important
engineering material used in various fields of industry, energy, engineering,
electronics, and medicine.24−26

The catalytic properties
of YSZ are caused by specific peculiarities
of the electronic structure and are related to their redox and acid–base
characteristics.27,28 The addition of ZrO2, a substitution cation with a lower valence than Zr4+, causes the generation of oxygen vacancies to compensate the charge.
Two Y3+ ions generate one vacancy on the anionic sublattice,
which determines the conductivity of O2– ions. Because
of this, YSZ is widely used as a catalyst and support in various processes,
in particular, oxidation, hydrogenation, amination, isomerization,
and so forth.29 The efficiency of YSZ as
a well-known material with an established production technology for
bioethanol processing to higher alcohols can open up new prospects
for the use of these materials in catalysis.

The calcination
temperature is an important factor having an effect
on the phase, structural, and acid–base characteristics of
oxide catalysts,30 which ultimately determines
their catalytic properties. Therefore, the purpose of this work was
to study the effect of the calcination temperature on acid–base
and catalytic characteristics of YSZ for ethanol to n-butanol Guerbet coupling. The research objects in this work were
ZrO2–Y2O3 compositions calcined
at temperatures 300–900 °C. The Y2O3 content in oxide compositions was 3.4 mol % because this concentration
of the additive favors the crystallization of ZrO2 mainly
as a tetragonal phase.31,32

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structure Parameters and Phase Compositions
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of YSZ compositions are shown
in Figure 1. For the
YSZ 300 sample, no pronounced peaks in the XRD pattern was observed,
indicating that this solid is amorphous and has too weak crystallinity
to identify. Higher calcination temperatures cause the crystallization
of zirconia. The increase in the calcination temperature up to 400
°C commonly results in the formation of the cubic phase of ZrO2. However, the local structure determined by the radial distribution
functions of the electronic density33 for
the YSZ-400 sample exhibits split coordination peaks corresponding
to tetragonal distortion of the anion sublattice that was found in
the YSZ-400 sample.34 YSZ 500 and YSZ 700
compositions also contain only tetragonal ZrO2. The increase
in the calcination temperature of YSZ compositions up to 900 °C
leads to a gradual transition from the metastable tetragonal phase
of ZrO2 to the stable monoclinic one.35 Therefore, although the tetragonal phase predominates in
the YSZ 900 sample, a certain amount of the monoclinic phase is also
present.

Figure 1 XRD patterns for YSZ compositions.

Figure 2 shows the
low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for
YSZ compositions. According to the Brunauer classification,36 all isotherms correspond to type IV. Capillary
condensation in mesopores occurs at p/p0 > 0.5 (0.5 for YSZ 400, 0.7 for YSZ 500 and 0.8 for
YSZ 900). A sharp rise in isotherms at p/p0 < 0.05 may be caused by the filling of
micropores. All isotherms can be classified as type H1 accordingly
to the shape of the hysteresis loop.37 H1
isotherms are typical for uniformly packed agglomerates and close
in size spherical particles. The corresponding pore size distribution
curves for YSZ compositions are presented in Figure 3.

Table 1 represents
some structural characteristics (specific area, Sspec; average pore diameter, d̅pores; and pore volume, VS) and phase composition for the YSZ samples according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and XRD data.

Heat treatment leads to significant changes in the
parameters of
the porous structure of ZrO2: the specific surface area
of the samples calculated by the BET method decreases from 209 to
21 m2/g, which is probably due to the sintering of particles
with increasing calcination temperature. Herewith, larger ZrO2 particles form wider pores: the average pore diameter increases
from 2.4 to 18.2 nm, and the total pore volume decreases from 0.43
to 0.24 cm3/g. Within a temperature interval 500–700
°C, especially sharp change in the structure occurs. The average
pore diameter for YSZ 300, YSZ 400, and YSZ 500 samples does not exceed
8 nm (Table 1), while
for YSZ 700 and YSZ 900 samples, this value is 15–18 nm. Thus,
an increase in the calcination temperature leads to the formation
of larger pores and to a decrease in the specific surface.

2.2 FTIR Study
The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra for all YSZ compositions in the 4000–400
cm–1 range are shown in Figure 4. The bands at 1638, 1617, and 1087 (1065)
cm–1 are attributed to bidentate carbonate or bidentate
hydrocarbonate [band at 1243 cm–1 −δ(OH)]
that could be assigned to strongly adsorbed CO2 as CO32–/HCO3– over
strong basic sites.38−41 The ratio between CO32–/HCO3– depends on the calcination temperature of the
YSZ.42 The bands at 1384 cm–1 with shoulder at 1350 cm–1 could be attributed
to vibration modes of monodentate carbonate species that may correspond
to the carbon dioxide associated with weak basic sites.39−41 The intensity of these bands decreases with the increase of pretreatment
temperature of YSZ powders.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of YSZ powders calcined at different
temperatures.

2.3 Acid–Base Properties
Figure 5 shows the differential
curves of ammonia and carbon dioxide quasi-equilibrium thermal desorption
(QE-TD) results for YSZ samples, which demonstrate the energetic heterogeneity
of the acid–base sites. Within the whole temperature interval
of adsorption of probe substances, it is possible to distinguish several
regions corresponding to adsorption on acid–base sites of various
strength.

Figure 5 Differential QETD curves of ammonia (a) and carbon dioxide (b)
for YSZ compositions.

Because the desorption temperature of a probe substance
in the
quasi-equilibrium mode correlates with its adsorption heat,43 this parameter serves as an indirect characteristic
of the strength of acid–base sites. The temperatures of maxima
for the desorption peaks (Tdesmax) characterize the average strength
of the acid–base sites of a certain type. The temperatures
of total desorption (Tdestotal) are related to the adsorption heat
of the probe substance at zero coverage and characterize the limit
strength of acid–base sites.

The results obtained show
that the region of ammonia desorption
from the surface of YSZ samples corresponds to lower temperatures
than for carbon dioxide. This indicates a higher strength of the base
sites, compared with acid ones. The data on the distribution of acid–base
sites by strength are summarized in Table 2.

YSZ 900	 	85	135	185	 	200	60	115	 	 	 	150	
Both in the case of NH3 and CO2 adsorption,
there is a certain portion of sites with Tdesmax of probe substances
below 50 °C. The adsorption region of probe substances for these
super weak acid and base sites includes a temperature range up to
75 °C. Super weak acid sites are characteristic for YSZ samples
with relatively low calcination temperatures (300–500 °C).
The presence of super weak base sites was registered for all studied
samples, with the exception of YSZ 700.

The adsorption of NH3 on weak acid sites corresponds
to a temperature range of 75–100 °C, and the adsorption
of CO2 on weak base sites corresponds to 75–125
°C. The ammonia adsorption on acid sites of medium strength observed
at 100–150 °C and the carbon dioxide adsorption on the
base sites of medium strength occurs in the range of 125–170
°C. The NH3 adsorption region on strong acid sites
corresponds to the temperatures of 150–200 °C, and the
CO2 adsorption region on strong base sites corresponds
to the temperatures of 160 to 250 °C. Higher temperatures are
related to the adsorption of probe substances over super acid and
super base sites. Super acid sites are only observed for the YSZ 700
sample and super base ones only for the YSZ 500 sample.

The
strong acidity of ZrO2 is related to the acid Lewis
sites representing the coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ particles
and the strong basic properties of zirconia are assigned to the presence
of O2– sites.19,44 Hydroxyl groups of
zirconia having an amphoteric nature can possess both weak Brønsted
acidity and weak basicity.27 Herewith,
OH-groups of ZrO2 can represent several types of basic
sites of various strength, which form monodentate and bidentate hydrocarbonates
upon adsorption of CO2. The last type adsorbed complexes
are very weak because they are destroyed easily with minimal heating.39 In addition, CO2 can form the adsorption
complexes of media strength with acid–base pairs (coordinatively
unsaturated Zr4+–O2–).27,45

The main quantitative characteristics of acidity/basicity
of samples,
determined using the QE-TD method, are the acid/base capacity (mmol/g)
and surface density (mmol/m2) of the sites. The relevant
data on the acid and basic characteristics of the samples are shown
in Table 3.

Table 3 Acid–Base Characteristics of
YSZ Compositions
 	acidity	basicity	
sample	acid capacity mmol NH3/g	acid density ×103, mmol NH3/m2	base capacity mmol CO2/g	base density
×103, mmol CO2/m2	
YSZ 300	0.46	2.20	0.41	1.93	
YSZ 400	0.42	2.64	0.23	1.46	
YSZ 500	0.27	2.89	0.42	4.49	
YSZ 700	0.14	3.29	0.12	2.72	
YSZ 900	0.07	3.43	0.08	4.00	
An increase in the calcination temperature leads to
a decrease
of the acid capacity, while the surface density of acid sites increases.
Simultaneously, the strength of acid sites varies in a nonmonotonous
way: the highest Tdestotal NH3 is characteristic for YSZ
700 and the lowest for YSZ 300. For the base sites, both the capacity
and surface density are also having no monotonous dependence with
an increase in the calcination temperature. The YSZ 500 sample is
the most basic in terms of base capacity, density, and strength of
the basic sites. In general, for YSZ 300, YSZ 400, and YSZ 700 samples,
the acidity is higher than the basicity, while for YSZ 500 and YSZ
900 samples, the base capacity exceeds the acid one. Between the YSZ
400 and YSZ 500 samples, there is a sharp increase in base capacity
with a simultaneous decrease in acid capacity. As a result, the acid–base
spectra for YSZ 400 and YSZ 500 differ significantly: the acidity
of the YSZ 400 sample is 1.8 times higher than its basicity, while
for the YSZ 400 sample the basicity is 1.6 times higher than the acidity.

As noted above, for all samples except YSZ 900, the strength of
the base sites is not lower than the acid ones. The patterns of changes
in the strength of acid/base sites with an increase in the calcination
temperature of YSZ samples are depicted in Figure 6. Both on the acidity and basicity, the samples
can be divided into two groups with a decrease in Tdestotal for
each of them. However, the “boundary position” in acidity
and basicity is occupied by different samples: YSZ 700 has the highest
strength of acid sites (Tdestotal NH3 = 250 °C), and
YSZ 500 has the highest strength of the basic ones (Tdestotal CO2 = 325 °C). Thus, the strength of acid–base sites
before and after maximum values of Tdestotal NH3 and Tdestotal CO2 gradually decreases.

calcination temperature on the limit strength of
acid and base sites of the YSZ compositions.

2.4 Catalytic Performance
Studies have
shown that YSZ is a sufficiently active catalyst for the vapor phase
coupling of ethanol to n-butanol. Herewith, under
conditions of our experiments, a number of products were formed: n-butanol, n-hexanol, ethylene, light alkenes,
1.3-butadiene, diethyl ether, acetaldehyde, acetone, ethyl acetate,
and crotonaldehyde. The data on ethanol conversion, selectivity toward
resulting products, and n-butanol yield at 300 °C
are summarized in Table 4.

BuOH—n-butanol, n-HeOH—n-hexanol.

The ethanol conversion over YSZ catalysts reached
24.7%. The main
reaction product was n-butanol, reaching 70% selectivity.
The most selective (above 60%) catalysts towards n-butanol formation are samples containing exclusively the tetragonal
ZrO2. Both over the amorphous YSZ 300 sample and YSZ 900
sample with the monoclinic phase, a side reaction of the ethylene
formation predominantly occurs, and therefore, the n-butanol selectivity is much lower (15–20%).

The dependence
of n-butanol productivity on the
calcination temperature of YSZ catalysts is represented by a volcano-shaped
curve (Figure 7). This
dependence shows that the medium YSZ calcination temperatures, when
the tetragonal phase of zirconia is the most effectively stabilized,
are necessary to obtain an effective catalyst for the Guerbet reaction.
Long-term durability tests for the most active of the studied catalysts
YSZ 500 were conducted and showed that YSZ 500 is fairly stable. During
12 h on the stream, EtOH conversion decreased from 24.2 to 23.8% whereas n-butanol selectivity slowly increased from 69.2 to 71.1%.

Figure 7 Dependence
of n-butanol productivity (mass and
specific) on the calcination temperature of YSZ catalysts.

Direct correlations of acid–base characteristics
and the
catalytic activity of the YSZ samples have not been observed. However,
comparison allows us to draw some qualitative conclusions about the
effect of acidity and basicity on the n-butanol selectivity
in the Guerbet process. The most active toward the n-butanol formation YSZ 400 and YSZ 500 catalysts are characterized
by the presence of strong basic and relatively weak acid sites. Such
a type of acid–base spectrum promotes the condensation of ethanol
and does not contribute to the side reaction of EtOH dehydrogenation
which is characteristic for zirconia catalysts. The YSZ 700 catalyst
also has strong base sites and exhibits high selectivity for the target
product. A small concentration of both acid and base sites leads to
a low conversion and low mass productivity for n-butanol;
although due to the less developed surface, this catalyst has higher
specific productivity for BuOH than YSZ 400. The YSZ 500 catalyst
is the most effective both in terms of mass and specific n-butanol productivity.

According to the data presented in Table 5, n-butanol selectivity
and yield over the YSZ 500 catalyst under the study is sufficiently
higher than over individual zirconia (more than 4 times) and most
of the other oxide systems investigated by various authors under conditions
comparable to our experiments. The higher BuOH yields than for YSZ
500 are achieved only over a Cu/HSACeO2 catalyst, when
the process is carried out under pressure in a supercritical CO2 reactor.46 Consequently, YSZ can
be considered as a promising catalyst for the production of higher
alcohols from ethanol.

3 Conclusions
Our results show that YSZ
is a sufficiently effective catalyst
for ethanol to n-butanol Guerbet coupling. When studying
YSZ, we obtained catalysts characterized by high selectivity (up to
70%) and a fairly high yield of n-butanol (up to
16.8%). The high activity of YSZ catalysts is primarily due to their
acid–base bifunctionality and the phase composition, which
consists of a ZrO2–Y2O3 solid
solution with a crystalline structure corresponding to tetrahedral
zirconia. The calcination temperature can be an effective tool for
the improvement of the catalytic characteristics of this material
by stabilizing the tetragonal zirconia phase, which is more basic
than the monoclinic one. To obtain an effective YSZ catalyst for the
Guerbet reaction, medium calcination temperatures (400–500
°C) are required. Such temperatures increase the strength of
the base sites of catalysts necessary for the realization of the key
stage of the process—aldol condensation. Simultaneously, there
is a decrease in the strength and concentration of acid sites responsible
for the occurrence of a side reaction of ethanol dehydration to ethylene.
Accordingly, both at higher and lower calcination temperatures, the
deficient basicity leads to a decrease in the rate of aldol condensation,
which appears as an increase in selectivity for acetaldehyde over
YSZ 300 and YSZ 900 samples. Moreover, an increase in the strength
of acid sites favors a side reaction of the ethylene formation.

Thereby, YSZ catalysts with medium calcination temperatures demonstrate
sufficiently higher n-butanol selectivity and yield
than individual zirconia and other oxide systems, which have been
studied in this reaction by various authors. Given a quite wide market
availability and the developed technologies for this material production,
yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide can be considered as a promising
high-efficiency catalyst for ethanol to n-butanol
processing.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalysts Preparation
YSZ samples,
containing 3.4 mol % Y2O3 were synthesized by
coprecipitation of corresponding hydroxides from nitrates with aqueous
ammonia at pH 9 followed by the microwave drying at 2450 MHz frequency.49 The resulting solids were calcined in the temperature
range from 300 to 900 °C. The YSZ samples were marked corresponding
to the calcination temperature.

4.2 Structure Characterization
XRD patterns
of the powder samples were obtained using a HZG-4C diffractometer
with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (graphite filter). Data
were collected over a diffraction angle range 2θ = 10–70°
with a step size of 0.05° at a scanning speed of 0.2° min–1. This 2θ range allows us to index a tetragonal
and monoclinic modifications of YSZ.34 Qualitative
phase analysis and cell parameters have been carried out via JCPDS-ICDD
files, ICSD/retrieve database, and FullProf program. A low-temperature
nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained by the volumetric method
using a sorptometer Kelvin 1042 (Costech Microanalytical) at temperature
−196 °C. The specific surface areas Sspec of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption
values at monomolecular layer distribution on the surface of the samples.

4.3 FTIR Study
The FTIR absorption spectra
of the YSZ powders were recorded using the transmission mode on a
PerkinElmer Spectrum One Fourier IR spectrometer with a spectral resolution
of 2 cm–1. Three milligrams of the sample was dispersed
in 100 mg of KBr and pressed at ∼7 ton cm–2 into thin wafers with a density of 15 mg/cm2. Prior to
the studies, the samples were treated for 1 h by heating at 400 °C
under vacuum (10–3 mm Hg). The FTIR spectra were
recorded at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in the wavenumber
range of 4000–400 cm–1 with a resolution
of 1 cm–1 and accumulating 12 scans.

4.4 Acidity and Basicity Measurement
The acid–base properties of YSZ samples were studied by the
method of QE-TD of NH3 (acidity) and CO2 (basicity).20,21 Prior to adsorption, the samples were heated in vacuum at a temperature
determined by their calcination, until a constant weight was reached.
The adsorption of test substances was carried out at room temperature
until no uptake was observed, and the surplus was removed under vacuum.
The weight was recorded with the stepwise temperature increase and
evacuation. The concentration of acid–base sites was determined
by the amount of probe substance adsorbed on the sample at 50 °C.

4.5 Catalytic Experiments
Catalytic properties
of YSZ samples were tested at 300 °C and atmospheric pressure.
Samples with grains of 1–2 mm were loaded into the fixed-bed
flow quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. The temperature
of the experiments was chosen as optimum based on the results of previous
studies.16−18 Ethanol (azeotrope mixture with 4% of water) was
introduced to the evaporator via a syringe infusion pump. Ar was used
as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.17 cm3/s to achieve
a weight hourly space velocity of the reagent WHSV = 0.2 h–1. Before the catalytic tests, samples were treated for 1 h in an
Ar flow at 200 °C and then cooled down to the experiment temperature.
The reagents and reaction products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph
(KristalLyuks 4000M, Metachrome) equipped with a TCD detector and
a packed column (10% NiSO4 on coal, 3 m × 3 mm) for
CO and CO2 and a FID detector and a capillary column (HP-FFAP,
50 m × 0.32 mm) for organic compounds.

Catalytic properties
of YSZ compositions were characterized by EtOH conversion (X) and selectivity toward resulting products (Si)    where nEtOH0 is the initial amount of C
moles of EtOH; nEtOH and ni are the amount of C moles of unreacted
EtOH and product i in the stream of the reaction
products, respectively.

The activity of catalysts in the n-butanol formation
was characterized by the n-BuOH yield, YBuOH, (%) and n-BuOH productivity, rBuOH (mol/(s·g))    where M is the molecular
weight of butanol (74.12 g/mol).
