This study reports the key ingredients
that influence the orientation
and stability of a α-Fe2O3 layer that
grows on a metastable ε-Fe2O3 during pulsed
laser deposition. Depending on the substrate temperature, two different
α-Fe2O3 orientations arise on the ε-Fe2O3 (004) surface. At 800 °C, (2–10)α-oriented α-Fe2O3 is stabilized,
whereas at 700 °C, (006)α orientation occurs.
The (2–10)α-oriented α-Fe2O3 layer possesses an interface with densely packed Fe
ions with presumably considerable number of oxygen vacancies. On the
other hand, the (006)α-oriented α-Fe2O3 layer is stabilized, as in the case of the YSZ (100)
substrate, due to the domain pattern with an in-plane rhombic shape,
which is known to become an effective nucleation site. Growth with
the unexpected (2–10)α orientation can be
understood based on a model that takes into account the surface energy
as the dominant factor, which mainly stems from the presence of dangling
bonds on the surface and the atomic vibration of the surface atoms.
As the surface is one of the critical elements related to the specific
functionality of a material, the present study will offer valuable
insights into the designs of functional devices with novel surface
properties.

==== Body
I Introduction
Chemical reactions involving
a solid, such as a catalytic reaction,
occur on the surface.1−4 The performance of such reactions therefore strongly depends on
certain surface characteristics such as the surface orientation and
surface activity. Because the surface properties can depend on the
presence of dangling bonds, i.e., broken chemical bonds, and given
that each surface has different number of such bonds, one surface
can have quite different chemical activity from another, even in the
same material.5,6 Thus, engineering layer orientation
is a potentially efficient method for optimizing the properties of
surfaces.7−11 Controlling the surface orientation can easily be done in a single
crystal by cutting a sample in the desired direction. However, this
simple approach cannot be applied to a thin film because the substrate
predetermines the growth direction. Under these circumstances, it
is necessary to manipulate the growth itself by controlling the growth
processes so that the film grows in the desired direction. However,
this is not easily achieved because the parameters that determine
the film orientation are not fully understood. In this study, we find
that two different α-Fe2O3 orientations
arise on the ε-Fe2O3 (004) surface depending
on the substrate temperature. The critical ingredients related to
the film orientation are the number of dangling bonds on the surface
and the degree of atomic vibration on the surface. The surface energy
of a given surface is proportional to the number of dangling bonds
per area. At low temperatures, the (006)α surface
is lower in energy compared to the (2–10)α surface because the former has fewer dangling bonds. However, due
to the atomic vibration of the atoms on the surface, the surface energy
in the (2–10)α case becomes comparable to
that in the (006)α case at high temperatures.

Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3 or ferric oxide) is
one of the suitable oxide materials that could be used in spintronic
devices.12−14 To date, five crystalline polymorphs of Fe2O3 have been discovered. These are the naturally abundant
α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 phases, the high-pressure-stabilized ζ-Fe2O3 phase, and the laboratory-synthesized β-Fe2O3 and ε-Fe2O3 phases.15 All of these polymorphs exhibit different crystal
structures and magnetic properties.12−22 Most coexist during the phase transformation of Fe2O3.20,23,24 As a result,
it is challenging to study the fundamental issues such as the nucleation
and growth of an individual Fe2O3 polymorph.
Owing to a lack of understanding of the influence of the growth parameters,
it is a great challenge to search for the primary parameter that causes
polymorphous transformations when seeking to prepare a single phase
of Fe2O3. In particular, the preparation of
a phase-pure ε-Fe2O3 has also been very
challenging due to contamination with other polymorphs such as α-Fe2O3. Hence, a deeper understanding of the effects
of the growth parameters in relation to these Fe2O3 polymorphisms is required if a controllable and reliable
method for the synthesis of pure ε-Fe2O3 is to be developed.

ε-Fe2O3 is
a rare Fe2O3 polymorph that exists only in a
nanostructure form, with
low abundance.20 This polymorph is a metastable
phase of iron(III) oxide, a structural intermediate between γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3.25 As the surface energy contribution stabilizes
ε-Fe2O3, it transforms into a more stable
α-Fe2O3 when its size exceeds a critical
value. The ε-Fe2O3 phase has an orthorhombic
crystal structure with the Pna21 space
group and lattice parameters of a = 5.095, b = 8.789, and c = 9.437 Å. ε-Fe2O3 is a polar ferrimagnet that exhibits a strong
magnetoelastic coupling.26−30 It is the first room-temperature multiferroic system with a single
active ion27,31,32 and with properties superior to those of other known magnetoelectric
oxides in that its Curie temperature Tc of ∼510 K is high.30,33,34 It also attracts considerable interest owing to its pronounced magnetocrystalline
anisotropy, which results in a large coercive field and a natural
ferromagnetic resonance frequency in the terahertz range.12,13,35 Thus far, ε-Fe2O3 has been synthesized in nanoparticle form in confined
nanoreactors by sol–gel-based methods,35 as nanowires,36,37 or as a thin film on limited
substrates.25 As nanostructures and nanoparticles
are usually randomly oriented, a textured or epitaxial thin film of
ε-Fe2O3 is necessary for application of
this exciting material to devices.

In this study, we mainly
focus on the polymorphous transformation
to α-Fe2O3 in a metastable ε-Fe2O3 thin film grown on the SrTiO3 (STO)(111)
surface using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). We found that the critical
thickness of ε-Fe2O3 is approximately
17 nm, below which ε-Fe2O3 is stable.
High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements show that above this critical thickness,
the α-Fe2O3 phase with two different orientations
starts to emerge; one with the (006)α//(004)ε relationship at 700 °C and the other with the
(2–10)α//(004)ε at 800 °C.
The (2–10)α-oriented α-Fe2O3 layer possesses an interface with densely packed Fe
ions and with presumably considerable number of oxygen vacancies.
On the other hand, the (006)-oriented α-Fe2O3 forms due to specific domain patterns in ε-Fe2O3 with an in-plane rhombic edge, which are known to be
effective nucleation sites for α-Fe2O3.38 The unexpected growth orientation
at a high substrate temperature is understood on the basis of a model
in which the surface energy from dangling bonds and atomic vibration
of the surface atoms plays a dominant role. It is expected that the
significant strain in the (2–10)-oriented α-Fe2O3 layer is released by oxygen vacancies at the interface.

II Results and Discussion
II.I Influence of Substrate
Temperature and Laser
Energy Density
As the laser energy density and the substrate
temperature are two major growth parameters during the PLD synthesis
process, their effects on the growth of ε-Fe2O3 thin films were initially explored. We systematically investigated
the ε-Fe2O3 thin films grown on the STO(111)
surfaces at temperatures of T = 600, 700, and 800
°C at an approximate energy density of F = 2.0
J/cm2. We could confirm the formation of the ε-Fe2O3 phase by means of in-house X-ray diffraction
measurements, as shown in Figure 1a,b. These data show only the (00l)ε reflections (l = 2n, n is an integer) of the ε-Fe2O3 phase. However, these in-house measurements are incapable
of detecting tiny diffraction peaks of impurity phases and other Fe2O3 polymorphs. Thus, synchrotron X-rays measurements
were carried out to identify such small signals, as will be shown
later. The three main peaks at 2θ = 38.2, 58.7, and 81.4°
correspond to the (004)ε, (006)ε, and (008)ε reflections of the ε-Fe2O3 structure, respectively. From these peak positions,
the out-of-plane lattice parameter is estimated to be about c = 9.465 Å, which is in agreement with the reported
bulk value. This demonstrates a strain relaxation of the ε-Fe2O3 layer. In fact, the values of the in-plane lattice
mismatch between ε-Fe2O3 and STO(111)
substrate are (√6aSTO –
2aε)/2aε ∼ −6% and (3√2aSTO – 2bε)/2bε ∼ −6% for [100]ε//[1–21]STO and [010]ε//[303]STO directions, respectively. Large strain is released by forming
dislocations at the interface. Indeed, we observed dislocations at
the interface in our preliminary scanning TEM experiments. Figure 1a,b compares the
ε-Fe2O3 thin films grown at F = 1.7 and 2.0 J/cm2, respectively. At each energy density
level, deposition at different temperatures was done for identical
periods, ensuring that the film thicknesses were also identical. Using
X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements, we estimated the thickness
of the films shown in Figure 1a,b, revealing a value of approximately 15 nm.

on the STO(111) substrate at energy density values of E = 1.7 J/cm2 (a) and E = 2.0 J/cm2 (b) at different temperatures. (c, d) Fitting of the (006)
reflections based on the Gaussian peak profile. (e) Integrated intensity
of the (006) peaks as a function of the substrate temperature. (f)
Full width at half-maximum (FWHM) as a function of the substrate temperature.

To quantify the crystallinity of the films at different
temperatures
with the given energy density, we calculated the integrated intensity
of the (006)ε peaks. To do this, the (006)ε peaks were fit with the Gaussian profile. First, the data were normalized
according to the STO(111) peak to remove the scale factor. The width
of the (006)ε peaks was observed and found to be
larger than the instrumental resolution due to the finite size effect.
It is well known that a small grain size results in the line broadening
of a peak. This line broadening is expressed by the Scherrer equation D = Kλ/β cos(θ),
where D is the grain size, K is
a dimensionless shape factor whose value is around 1, λ is the
wavelength of the X-ray, β is the width of the peak in radians,
and 2θ is the angle of reflection. The width of the (006)ε reflection is approximately 0.6°, giving rise
to a grain size of ∼16 nm according to the Scherrer equation.
This value is in excellent agreement with the thickness ∼15
nm of the films. This result implies that the line width of the (006)ε reflection is indeed broadened by the finite size effect,
as expected. As shown in Figure 1c,d, the (006)ε peaks are quite well
fitted to the Gaussian profile. At F = 1.7 J/cm2, the integrated intensity of the peak increases with an increase
in the growth temperature, while the full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
decreases, as shown in Figure 1e,f, respectively. On the other hand, at F = 2.0 J/cm2, the film grown at 700 °C has the highest
integrated intensity, suggesting the best crystallinity at this temperature.

II.II Stability of the ε-Fe2O3 Phase and Its Polymorphous Transition to α-Fe2O3
We also systematically studied the stability
of the ε-Fe2O3 thin film grown on the
STO(111) surface and its polymorphous transition to α-Fe2O3 at different laser energy densities and substrate
temperatures. We focus on two substrate temperatures: 700 and 800
°C. The growth conditions used in the present study are summarized
in Table 1. Under these
conditions, we grew several thin films with different thicknesses
for different deposition times to determine the critical thickness,
beyond which a minor Fe2O3 polymorph emerges.
We could detect tiny X-ray signals from the minor polymorph by obtaining
the measured synchrotron HRXRD data. Figure 2a shows the synchrotron HRXRD data of the
ε-Fe2O3 thin film sample synthesized at Ts = 800 °C. These data indicate the growth
of the single ε-Fe2O3 phase up to 10 nm,
as there are no additional peaks other than those from the ε-Fe2O3 structure. On the other hand, additional peaks
emerge in the film with a thickness of 17 nm. These additional peaks
are identified as (2–10)α and (4–20)α from the α-Fe2O3 structure,
and they have epitaxial relationship of (2–10)α//(004)ε. This result suggests that the critical
thickness below which the ε-Fe2O3 phase
is stable without any second phase is <17 nm in our growth condition.
In samples thicker than 17 nm, the α-Fe2O3 phase eventually becomes stabilized because ε-Fe2O3 is unstable in this thickness range.

Table 1 Growth Conditions in this Study
sample batch number	E (J/cm2)	Ts (°C)	oxygen pressure (Torr)	orientation of α-Fe2O3	
1	2.0	700	3 × 10–3	(006)	
2	2.2	700	3 × 10–3	(006)	
3	1.7	800	3 × 10–3	(2–10)	
4	2.2	800	3 × 10–3	(2–10)	
Unlike the case above, the
ε-Fe2O3 films
grown at Ts = 700 °C show completely
different features, as presented in Figure 2f. The films in the vicinity of the critical
thickness exhibit both ε-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 peaks with the epitaxial relationship of (006)α//(004)ε. This epitaxial relationship
is in sharp contrast to the case discussed above. Upon increasing
the thickness of the film, the ε-Fe2O3 peaks vanish completely, which indicates the instability of the
ε-Fe2O3 films on the STO(111) surfaces
when the film is thick. In the thick-film region, α-Fe2O3 grows epitaxially. How such an epitaxial α-Fe2O3 layer grows without the ε-Fe2O3 layer is an interesting issue because it is likely
that ε-Fe2O3 first nucleates and subsequently
grows before the α-Fe2O3 layer. This absence
of ε-Fe2O3 in a thick film implies that
the interface energy between the ε-Fe2O3 layer with the (004)ε orientation and α-Fe2O3 with (006)α is positive and
that it becomes more positive with an increase in the thickness of
α-Fe2O3. Hence, a ε-Fe2O3 layer in contact with a thick α-Fe2O3 cannot survive, transforming into α-Fe2O3. This will also be the case for the (2–10)α orientation. Of course, the stability problem depends
on the growth kinetics as well. For instance, if the deposition rate
is very high or if the thermal energy is not sufficient, the activation
barriers will not be overcome. In such cases, a metastable phase,
which nucleates initially but cannot fully relax, can grow to a certain
thickness. However, this is not the case here. Therefore, our growth
conditions are considered as quasi-thermodynamic because the α-Fe2O3 phase grows with no ε-Fe2O3 when the film is thick. On the other hand, ε-Fe2O3 becomes thermodynamically stable when its thickness
is below the critical value. This is possible owing to the surface
energy contribution at the domain boundaries in a specific domain
pattern.13,25,38,39 Moreover, the absence of a correlation between the
layer orientation and the laser energy that determines the energy
of the plume particles also indicates the relative unimportance of
the kinetic factors in our growth condition. Table 1 summaries the growth conditions with the
orientation of the α-Fe2O3 layer. This
table shows that the substrate temperature is the main control parameter
of the layer orientation. The above picture might not be valid if
ε-Fe2O3 is formed during the cooling down
period. However, this cannot happen in the present case because α-Fe2O3 is thermodynamically more stable. Thus, it is
not thermodynamically preferable that α-Fe2O3 transforms into ε-Fe2O3 at temperature
range below 800 °C. As explained before, the most important stabilizing
factor of ε-Fe2O3 on STO(111) is the domain
wall energy.25

Next, consider the
structural relationship between the ε-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 layers.
α-Fe2O3 has a rhombohedral structure with
lattice parameters of aα = bα = 5.03 and cα = 13.74 Å, while ε-Fe2O3 is orthorhombic
with aε = 5.08, bε = 8.78, and cε = 9.47 Å.16,18Figure 2c illustrates a ε-Fe2O3 (004)ε plane with planar unit cells whose
cell parameters are aε and bε. Above, the two-dimensional (2D) units
of (2–10)α are displayed. As highlighted in Figure 2b, the (2–10)α plane is shown inside the conventional hexagonal unit
cell of α-Fe2O3 by the red lines with
short and long lengths of √3/2aα and cα, respectively. The short
length of √3/2aα of this
rectangle approximately matches the aε parameter or one half of the bε lattice parameter. Therefore, there are two possibilities for this
rectangle to cover the (004)ε plane, as shown in Figure 2d,e. The first case
is that the short length √3/2aα and the long length cα are aligned
along the aε and bε directions, respectively. Figure 2d shows such a pattern. The second is that
the short length √3/2aα and
the long length cα are aligned in
opposite directions relative to the first case, as illustrated in Figure 2e. In the interface
structure in Figure 2d, compressive strains with (2cα – 3bε)/3bε ∼ 4.3% and (7√3/2 aα – 6aε)/6aε ∼ 1.02% exist along
the bε and aε directions, respectively. In the case shown in Figure 2e, (2 √3/2aα – bε)/bε ∼ −0.77% and
(9cα – 24aε)/24aε ∼
1.42% imply tensile and compressive strains of −0.77 and 1.42%
along the bε and aε directions, respectively. For the release of such
large strains, a certain strain relaxation mechanism should exist.
One strain relaxation mechanism is the formation of misfit dislocations
at the interface. Another possibility is the formation of oxygen and
iron vacancies. Lighter oxygen anions are more easily separated from
the structure in metal oxides.40,41 Oxygen vacancies are
formed particularly near the dislocations and in interface regions
in which stress is high. By emptying oxygens, the strain is released
locally. When such oxygens accumulate, a considerable amount of strain
can be released.42 Thus, the (2–10)α-oriented α-Fe2O3 layer
is considered to possess a disordered interface structure with considerable
numbers of oxygen and iron
vacancies. In contrast to the above case, the X-ray data shown in Figure 2f can be understood
based on the interface structure illustrated in Figure 2g, as reported on the YSZ (100) surface in
earlier work.38 Three domains of ε-Fe2O3 form 120° patterns on the STO(111) surface,
as depicted on the right-hand side of Figure 2g. As aα ≈ aε, this pattern becomes
an effective nucleation site for α-Fe2O3. The α-Fe2O3 layer will grow on top
of ε-Fe2O3 along the [004]ε direction.

Figure 3 shows a
cross-sectional TEM image of the sample grown at T = 800 °C with a stacking sequence of α-Fe2O3(2–10)/ε-Fe2O3(004)/STO(111).
The TEM image reveals the existence of two layers with a somewhat
blurred interface, suggesting a disorder at the interface. Because
both layers contain the same elements, the density difference is negligible.
However, the atomic arrangements in each layer differ from each other,
as can be seen in Figure 3a. Moreover, the Fourier transforms of the real space image
clearly distinguish the structures of the two layers, as shown in Figure 3b,c. These findings
confirm that the upper layer is rhombohedral and the lower one is
orthorhombic, in good agreement with the XRD results. Notably, the
planar distances estimated from these Fourier transforms are consistent
with the reported bulk values, indicating a strain relaxation. The
strain is released possibly due to misfit dislocations and oxygen
vacancies at the interface, which may be the origin of the blurred
interface.

Figure 3 (a) TEM image of the ε-Fe2O3 thin film
grown on the STO(111) surface at F = 1.7 J/cm2 and Ts = 800 °C. In the
image, the upper and lower layers are separated. Fourier transform
results of the areas indicated by (b) blue dashed region and (c) red
dashed region in the real space image are presented.

We can view the matching of the α-Fe2O3 and ε-Fe2O3 layers from a more
microscopic
viewpoint. Figure 4b shows the top and side views of the (004)ε plane
in ε-Fe2O3. The 2D unit cell of this plane
consists of four octahedrally coordinated Fe ions (Fe 1, 3, 4, and
5) and two tetrahedrally coordinated Fe ions (Fe 2 and 6). The FeO6 octahedrons are located on the same plane, whereas the FeO4 tetrahedrons are above this plane. All of these polyhedrons
are connected by edge-sharing. On the other hand, the (2–10)α plane, displayed in Figure 4a, is composed of two chains of the FeO6 octahedron dimers formed via face-sharing (Fe 1 and 2). The
dimers and the intervening gaps between the dimers, which are aligned
along the c-direction, constitute a chain. The second chain, which
is displaced by one octahedral unit along the c-direction, is linked
to the first one along the direction. Here, an interchain connection
is made via corner-sharing (between Fe 1 and 3, and between Fe 1 and
4) and edge-sharing (between Fe 2 and 4). These atomic arrangements
of the (004) and (2–10) planes provide a better hint about
how the (004) and (2–10) planes are combined. For the case
shown in Figure 2d,
the tetrahedron-coordinated Fe ions on the (004)ε plane can occupy the gaps in the (2–10)α plane, as schematically illustrated in Figure 4c. This is a structure that reduces the repulsive
interaction between the Fe in the FeO4 tetrahedrons and
the Fe in the lower (004)ε. In contrast, in the case
shown in Figure 2c,
there is no match by which the FeO4 tetrahedrons in the
(004)ε plane regularly fill the gaps on the (2–10)α plane. In this combination, some of the FeO4 tetrahedrons are inevitably positioned at sites with no gap. This
configuration increases the interaction energy because the distance
between the Fe ions is too short. Therefore, it is unlikely that the
(2–10)α plane will be stabilized following
the configuration in Figure 2e. Even in the former interface structure, oxygen and iron
ions are displaced and even detached from their equilibrium positions
due to high levels of strain, dislocations, and symmetry mismatches.
According to Kelm et al.,43 ε-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 structures
indeed have a strong distortion in the arrangement of oxygen ions
in the polyhedral coordination, which may cause oxygens to shift and
become detached from the ideal sites, whereas the Fe ions move toward
empty sites.12,43 As the oxygen vacancies can have
an impact on the phase formation and orientations of the α-Fe2O3 layer, it is necessary to know the contents
of oxygen vacancies in the sample. In the present study, the samples
were synthesized at a relatively high oxygen pressure (10–3 Torr) and postannealed at a high oxygen atmosphere (30 Torr). Thus,
the investigated samples are thought to have relatively small concentrations
of oxygen vacancies and to be almost stiochiometric. It will be interesting
to investigate how the oxygen vaccancies affect the phase formation
and orientations of the α-Fe2O3 layer
(Figure 5).

II.III Effects of Substrate
Temperature and Surface
Energy on the α-Fe2O3 Layer Orientation
The orientation of the α-Fe2O3 layer
on the metastable ε-Fe2O3 is affected
by different energy contributions, such as the surface, interface,
and strain energies.44 Among these, the
surface energy is believed to be dominant in the present case for
the following reasons. First, the top layer is very thin and thus
possesses a large surface-to-volume ratio. Second, as discussed above,
the strain is almost entirely relaxed. Therefore, the contribution
by the strain energy must be minimal. Finally, as argued earlier,
the interface energy values of both α-Fe2O3 (2–10)/ε-Fe2O3 (004) and α-Fe2O3 (006)/ε-Fe2O3 (004)
are positive and thus destabilize these bilayer structures. In fact,
it is the surface energy and the domain wall energy in ε-Fe2O3 that make these natural heterostructures stable.

To understand the change of growth orientation of the α-Fe2O3 layer with temperature quantitatively, we apply
the surface-energy model.44,45 We consider a nucleus
with the radius r and the center angle 2θ,
as shown in Figure 4d. The free-energy change accompanying the formation of such a nucleus47 is given by 1  where f(θ) is an angular
factor, σ(hkl) is the surface energy of the
nucleus surface with the [hkl] orientation, and gv is the bulk condensation energy. A thermodynamic
equilibrium is achieved when dΔF/dr = 0. This condition gives rise to the critical nucleus size r = r* and activation barrier ΔF*. With the value of ΔF*, the growth
probability p(hkl) of a cluster
with the [hkl] orientation is expressed as 2  where K is a function of
θ and Ts is the substrate temperature.
This expression implies that the (hkl) surface with
the lowest surface energy tends to grow more readily.

The surface
energy is approximately proportional to the number
of dangling bonds.45−47 Therefore, it is necessary to compare the number
of dangling bonds per unit area to determine the lowest surface energy. Table 2 presents the number
of dangling bonds and the surface energy levels of the (006)α and (2–10)α surfaces.45−48 We define the bonding energy
per bond as ε and assume it to be independent of the surface
orientation, as the first approximation. Even if breaking a given
bond may redistribute the charges in the remaining bonds, the energy
related to this charge redistribution is lower than the energy spent
on breaking the bond itself. This dangling bond model suggests that
the surface energy of the (006)α surface is lower
than that of the (2–10)α surface. This is
in quite good agreement with the experimental observation at a lower
substrate temperature. However, this simple model cannot explain the
change of the layer orientation at an elevated substrate temperature.

Experimentally, the (2–10)α surface was
observed and found to be more stable at 800 °C. The change of
the stable surface at a higher substrate temperature can be understood
by considering the vibration of the surface atoms,45 which becomes more enhanced with an increase in the substrate
temperature. Within harmonic approximation, this vibration renormalizes
the surface energy, which increases drastically with Ts. The renormalized surface energy σ*(hkl) is expressed by 3  where ε is the bonding energy per bond
and C0 is a force constant between the
nearest-neighbor atoms. The constant α is a renormalization
factor of the bonding energy caused by atomic vibration. The bonding
energy is more renormalized by the vibration of the surface atoms
and the α value is larger. nd(hkl) represents the number of dangling bonds per atom on
the (hkl) plane.

Using eq 3, we calculated
the temperature dependences of the renormalized surface energy for the (006)α and (2–10)α layers as a function
of kBTS/ε. Figure 4 shows the calculated
renormalized surface energy plotted by assuming . Upon an increase in the temperature, the
surface of the upper layer undergoes an orientation change from σ*(006)
to σ*(2–10) at substrate temperature T1. The existence of this crossover temperature indicates
that the α-Fe2O3 layer could be stabilized
with a different surface orientation depending on the substrate temperature.
We acquired finite T1 values when , suggesting that σ*(006) and σ*(2–10)
always cross at a specific temperature only if the above condition
is satisfied.

III Conclusions
In
summary, we found that depending on the substrate temperatures,
a polymorph α-Fe2O3 layer grown on a ε-Fe2O3 film changes its orientation. At 800 °C
(700 °C), α-Fe2O3 grows along the
(2–10)α [(006)α] directions
on the ε-Fe2O3 (004)ε surface. In addition, α-Fe2O3 with the
(006)α orientation is stabilized due to the domain
patterns with an in-plane rhombic shape in ε-Fe2O3, creating effective nucleation sites for α-Fe2O3. On the other hand, α-Fe2O3 with the (2–10)α orientation forms a disordered
interface with significant numbers of oxygen vacancies. The main factor
to control the orientation of the α-Fe2O3 layer was found to be the surface energy, which is proportional
to the number of dangling bonds per area. At low temperatures, the
surface energy of the (006)α surface is lower because
that surface has fewer dangling bonds. However, due to the vibration
of the surface atoms, crossover in the surface energy occurs; the
(2–10)α surface energy becomes lower above
the crossover temperature. The present results demonstrate that the
orientation of a thin layer grown on another can be engineered, for
instance by changing the substrate temperature, when the strain and
interface energy do not dominate. As some important chemical reaction
occur on the surface, the present study will provide important insights
into the optimal ways to design catalysts, sensors, fuel cells, and
other components involved in surface reactions.

IV Experimental
Section
The ε-Fe2O3 films of
different thicknesses
were grown on the STO(111) substrates using a PLD technique. We investigated
the effects of the laser energy density and substrate temperature,
with focus on the two substrate temperatures of 700 and 800 °C.
Although we also examined the film growth at 600 °C, the crystallinity
of the samples grown at this temperature was inferior. The 248 nm
wavelength from a Kr excimer laser was used at a repetition rate of
2 Hz. A sintered α-Fe2O3 pellet was used
as a target, placed at a distance of 45 mm from the substrate. The
oxygen pressure was maintained at 3.0 × 10–3 Torr during the sample growth process and was increased to 30 Torr
at a substrate temperature of 600 °C for postannealing. The postannealing
was carried out to minimize the oxygen vacancies in the films and
to maintain their stoichiometry. The crystal structure of the films
was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Cu Kα radiation
in a Rigaku diffractometer (λ = 1.54 Å) and with synchrotron
X-rays (λ = 1.10898 Å) at the 3A beamline of the Pohang
Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). X-ray reflectivity (XRR) data were also
collected to estimate the thickness, the growth rate, and the surface/interface
roughness of the films. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements
were taken to characterize the microstructures, the thickness of the
thin film, and the structures on an atomic scale. To determine the
α-Fe2O3 orientation, we utilized a 3A
beamline of PAL. As the reflections from the minor α-Fe2O3 phase are at least 1 order of magnitude smaller
than those from ε-Fe2O3, the α-Fe2O3 peaks were undetectable in an in-house diffractometer.
