Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes belong to a superfamily
of heme-containing
proteins that are involved in the metabolism of structurally diverse
endogenous and exogenous compounds. Various proof-of-concept studies
indicate that metabolic stability and intrinsic clearance of CYP450
substrates are linked with the respective lipophilicity (log P or log D). This necessitates the
normalization of lipophilicity (log P or log D) of a given CYP450 substrate with respect to its metabolic
stability (LipMetE) and intrinsic clearance (log10CLint,u). Therefore, in this article, the LipMetE values of already
known substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, including
some marketed drugs, have been calculated to elucidate the relationship
between lipophilicity (log D7.4) and in vitro clearance. Moreover, various drug efficiency metrics
including lipophilic efficiency (LipE) and ligand efficiency (LE)
have been evaluated, and the thresholds of these parameters have been
defined for the CYP450 substrates exhibiting normalized LipMetE. Our
results indicate that for a given range of LipMetE, greater the log D value of the substrate the more avidly it binds to a given
CYP450 enzyme and shows more intrinsic clearance (log10CLint,u). Overall, the majority of the model substrates
of CYP450 isoforms and already marketed drugs in our datasets exhibit
log D7.4 values of ∼2.5
with LipMetE values in the range of 0–2.5 and LipE values of
≤3. Overall, consideration of these parameters in ADME profiling
could aid in reducing the drug failure rate in the later stages of
clinical investigations.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Research and development
(R&D) is the initial stage of the
development process in which the pharmaceutical companies apply research-based
knowledge and adopt various strategies to develop new products and
bring innovation to the industry.1−3 During the past decades,
huge technological advancements and access to a plethora of scientific
knowledge have prognosticated an all-time high R&D output.2 However, it is challenging for the pharmaceutical
companies to maintain the R&D productivity at a justifiable level.2 Moreover, the R&D productivity gap of the
pharmaceutical industry has been associated with poor pharmacokinetics/ADME-Tox
properties, lack of efficacy, and adverse drug–drug interactions.1

More recently, AstraZeneca implemented
a revised and more focused
R&D strategy to be used in the drug discovery and development
projects, showing a shift from quantitative (high-volume) to qualitative
strategies with a deeper understanding. To improve the overall R&D
productivity, AstraZeneca proposed a decision-making five-“R”
concept that is based on the right target, right tissue, right safety,
right patient, and right commercial potential. At AstraZeneca, evaluation
and application of the five-“R” concept to target validation
and selectivity, hit and lead optimization, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
(PK/PD) modeling, safety/toxicology, and efficacy have improved the
success rate at phase III from 4% in 2005–2010 to 19% in 2012–2016.2,3

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that understanding of
PK,
PK/PD, and ADME properties of new chemical entities is crucial for
improving quality in lead and drug candidate selection. Overall, drug
metabolism has been recognized as one of the most important factors
in pharmacokinetics and hence modulates the behavior of a drug.4 Among several human metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome
P450s are the heme-containing enzymes that account for ∼75%
of the drug metabolism.5 Among these, the
CYP1, CYP2, and CYP3 families mediate 70–80% of all phase I
metabolic reactions of clinically relevant drugs with CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2E1 performing 90% of the
drug metabolism.5

Induction of metabolic
enzymes by various chemical entities may
produce a suboptimal effect that results in high clearance due to
a high metabolic rate, whereas enzyme inhibition by some other chemical
scaffolds might produce an effect longer than that required to achieve
the desired therapeutic effect, thus resulting in undesired side effects.4,6 Moreover, the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes has an inherent
affinity for lipophilic substrates due to their lipophilic nature.7,8 Yet, highly lipophilic compounds might also possess a greater CYP
inhibition potential depending on their ionization states.9 However, in the drug discovery and design programs,
lipophilicity evaluates the permeability of a drug through the biomembrane
and, thus, affects its bioavailability.10 Therefore, the need to probe toxicological profiles of new chemical
entities (NCEs) during early stages of investigations is highly demanded.11

Toward this goal, various authors in the
past used several ligand-12 as well as
structure-based in silico approaches13,14 and hybrid
methods15,16 for toxicological profiling of
lead candidates. These include QSAR,17,18 machine-learning
methods,19,20 pharmacophore-based methods,21,22 shape-focused approaches, molecular interaction fields (MIFs),23 reactivity-focused techniques,24 docking25,26 and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
studies on different classes of modulators of CYP450, ABC transporters,
and the hERG K+ ion channel.27−30

Additionally, the impact
of lipophilicity on membrane permeability,
bioavailability, promiscuity, drug metabolism by CYP450s, and overall
ADME-Tox properties has also been reported by several authors in the
past.9−11,31−34 Various studies have reported a trend of increase in lipophilicity
during lead optimization protocols that results in low solubility
and poor absorption, and thus, might lead to rapid metabolic turnover
by CYP450 enzymes.35,36 The recently established lipophilic
metabolic efficiency (LipMetE) parameter ensures adequate metabolic
stability at the required lipophilicity level, even for compounds
with high lipophilic efficiency (LipE).37 It has been observed that a compound with metabolic flaws and consistently
very low LipMetE might fail to yield a quality clinical candidate
even if high LipE against the respective CYP450 isoform was achieved.38

To probe the therapeutic activities and
metabolism-related effects
of compounds, screening of large chemical libraries against specific
antitargets including CYP450s and on-targets is crucial during very
early phases of drug discovery, mainly during hit identification and
prior to lead optimization. Therefore, ligand optimization in the
context of targets as well as antitargets is highly demanded.39 Overall, CYP450s are known to metabolize a diverse
set of substrates depending on the nature of their binding sites,
thus representing diverse substrate properties for each CYP isoform.40 Therefore, in the present investigation, we
utilized the LipMetE parameter to elucidate the relationship between
lipophilicity and in vitro clearance of the CYP substrates. Additionally,
hit-to-lead efficiency metrics including lipophilic efficiency (LipE)
and ligand efficiency (LE) were calculated to probe the metabolic
attributes of CYP450 substrates.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Lipophilic Metabolic Efficiency (LipMetE)
Monitoring compound lipophilicity and maintaining it at a lower
level form an integral part of drug design/discovery criteria because
highly lipophilic chemical entities are recurrently associated with
greater risks.41 It is well established
that compounds with higher lipophilicity (c log P > 3) and lower polar surface area
(TPSA
< 75 Å2) pose a 6-fold greater risk during the
preclinical toxicology testing.42 Moreover,
the oxidative liability of the highly lipophilic compounds leads to
high clearance, poor bioavailability, and high dosage-dependent targeted
efficacy, making it amenable to severe toxicological outcomes.43 Therefore, due to the importance of lipophilicity
as a design parameter and to establish meaningful relationships (i.e.,
lipophilicity vs clearance), many design indices take into account
compound lipophilicity.37

The lipophilic
metabolic efficiency (LipMetE) is one parameter that depicts the relationship
between lipophilicity and clearance (in vitro HLM) in a similar manner
to LipE, where LipE describes the relationship of lipophilicity with
potency.37 Graphing the relationship between
lipophilicity (log D7.4) and metabolic
stability (log10CLint,u) can also be used to
understand the contribution of lipophilicity toward metabolic stability
through other factors (i.e., a compound’s intrinsic chemical
stability). For the clusters of related compounds with variable lipophilicity
values and the same LipMetE values, the differences in clearance are
mainly associated with changes in lipophilicity. However, for compounds
with similar lipophilicity values traversing the LipMetE lines, the clearance might be modulated
due to other factors (i.e., difference in the chemical stability,
blockage of the metabolic site, or the alteration in a substrate’s
intrinsic affinity for a particular CYP450 isozyme).37

Previously, it has been reported that drug-like compounds
usually
show LipMetE values between −2.0 and 2.0, and higher LipMetE
values (>2.5) are indicative of greater metabolic stability in
comparison
to lower LipMetE values.37 The compounds
with higher LipMetEs provide a wide range of log D7.4 values and, thus, can be used as important starting
points for the optimization/improvement of properties, such as potency
and permeability, in combination with low clearance.37 Various studies advocating the LipMetE concept have been
reported in the literature. Pettersson et al. demonstrated LipMetE
values of 0.9–2.0 for a series of pyridopyrazine-1,6-dione
γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) designed for the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease38 and a LipMetE
of 1.5 for the optimized cyclopropyl chromane-derived pyridopyrazine-1,6-dione-type
γ-secretase modulator.44 Similarly,
the optimization of the LipMetE parameter to achieve better ADME profiles
of a drug by 11 hydrogen-to-fluorine matched molecular pair (MMP)
transformations has been established elsewhere, and it is shown that
the OCH3-to-OCF3 transformation corresponded to an increase in LipMetE
from −0.5 to 2.0 in the MDR modulators.45

Optimization of LipMetE values with respect to lipophilicity
and
in vitro clearance advocates a promising concept to estimate the CYP450
substrate properties of new chemical entities (NCEs). Therefore, here
the LipMetE parameter has been calculated to decipher the relationship
between lipophilicity and in vitro clearance of the CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 substrate datasets, as described by Stepan
et al.37 (data shown in Table S2 of the Supporting Information), to probe the threshold
values of lipophilicity, in vitro clearance, and LipMetE for better
metabolic profiles of drug-like CYP450 substrates. Overall, the LipMetE
and log D7.4 distribution profiles
of the collated datasets display a wide range of LipMetE and log D7.4 values (i.e., <0 to >3), as shown
in Figures S1 and S2. The LipMetE, log D7.4, and log10CLint,u values
within −4.54 to 4.35, −1.19 to 4.24, and −3.08
to 4.7 (Figure 1a, Table S2) have been calculated for 43 CYP1A2 substrates, including 31 FDA-approved drugs (for drug classes refer
to Table S1).

Figure 1 LipMetE profiling of
(a) CYP1A2, (b) CYP2C9, (c) CYP2C19, (d) CYP2D6,
and (e) CYP3A4 substrates. Data points labeled in red in all LipMetE
profiling plots indicate the CYP450 substrates with metabolic stability
values between 0 and 4 (LipMetE).

Interestingly, only one compound, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP), exhibits a LipMetE value of 4.35, which might be correlated
with its very low clearance value (log10CLint,u −3.08, Table S2), whereas the
model substrate, 7-ethoxycoumarin, showed a LipMetE value of 2.99,
log D7.4 of 2.22, and an in vitro
clearance of −0.77 (log10CLint,u) (Table S2). The remaining compounds in our CYP1A2
substrate dataset span the LipMetE range of −4.54 to 1.86 with
the marketed drugs (amitriptyline, mexiletine, zolpidem, mirtazapine,
clozapine, nortriptyline, pimozide, and acetaminophen) exhibiting
LipMetE values within 0.11–1.86 (Figure 1a). Overall, for the CYP1A2 substrates, it
has been observed that marketed drugs and model substrates with suitable
metabolic profiles (LipMetE 0–2.5) show average LipMetE, log D7.4, and log10CLint,u values
of 0.94, 2.25, and 1.28, respectively, as shown in Table 1. This is further supported
by the similar LipMetE profiles of the CYP2C9 substrates.

a The average values for LipMetE,
LipE, log D7.4, and log10CLint,u have been derived using drugs and model substrates
from each dataset with better metabolic profiles (LipMetE 0–2.5).

A CYP2C9 substrate dataset of 43 compounds,
including
flavonoids, marker substrates, insecticides, experimental agents,
and various FDA-approved drugs (Table S1), with Km values in the range 0.4–2250
μM was used for the estimation of log D7.4 (−0.98 to 5.92), log10CLint,u (−0.015 to 5.18), and LipMetE values (−3.72 to 3.63),
as shown in Table S2. The already known
drugs metabolized by CYP2C9, namely, sertraline, zolpidem, mirtazapine,
meloxicam, and perphenazine along with one model substrate 7-ethoxycoumarin,
one flavonoid derivative, one organosulfur analogue, and two pesticides
(fenthion and sulprofos) displayed positive metabolic stability (LipMetE
0.066–1.56), as shown in Figure 1b. However, only desogestrel exhibits a very high positive
LipMetE of 3.62, which might be linked with its high log D7.4 value (5.92) (Figure 1b) as compared to the log D7.4 values of the rest of the data (−0.98
to 4.88). For the metabolically stable (LipMetE between 0 and 2.5)
marketed drugs and model substrates of CYP2C9, average LipMetE, log D7.4, and log10CLint,u values
of 0.69, 2.63, and 1.94 are shown (Table 1). Overall, the LipMetE values of CYP2C9
substrates lie within the range of LipMetE values established previously
for different drug-like compounds,37,38 which further
reflects the robustness of our LipMetE calculation model.

LipMetE
estimation was also performed on a dataset of 54 CYP2C19 substrates including investigational agents, hexobarbital
enantiomers, marker substrates, withdrawn drugs, insecticides, and
28 approved drugs (for drug classes refer to Table S1) with Km values in the range
0.43–89 000 μM (Table S2). The LipMetE values of the dataset range from −5.69 to 3.90
with only diazepam, flunitrazepam, and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol possessing
LipMetE of 3.2/3.9/4.75 and log D7.4 values of 2.92/2.03/5.68, respectively (Table S2, Figure 1c). The marketed drugs and model substrates metabolized by CYP2C19
that have values within the desired LipMetE (0–2.5) range display
an average LipMetE value of 0.703 with log D7.4 and log10CLint,u values of 2.73
and 2.02, respectively (Table 1), which is in line with the already established LipMetE parameters
against CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.

Similar results were achieved for
our dataset of CYP2D6 substrates. Briefly, CYP2D6 contributes
to the metabolism of about
20–25% of clinically relevant drugs, including β-blockers,
neuroleptics, antidepressants, and antiarrhythmics.46 For the calculation of the LipMetE parameter, the CYP2D6
substrate dataset was composed of 65 compounds, including marker substrates,
antioxidants, plant extracts, experimental and investigational compounds,
clinical candidates,47 active drug metabolites,
and a large number of FDA-approved drugs (Table S1), presenting LipMetE values within −6.35 to 2.93,
as shown in Table S2. However, already
marketed drugs displayed LipMetE values from 0.21 to 2.92 with an
average value of 1.03 (Table 1). Overall, loperamide, dextrorphan, and K11777 epitomize
the candidates with the highest LipMetE (2.9/2.19/2.83) and log D7.4 (3.94/1.67/3.8) values (Table S2, Figure 1d).

For CYP3A4, LipMetE values between
−6.19 and
3.85 have also been calculated for 86 substrates, including clinical
trial compounds and 63 FDA-approved drugs (drug classes shown in Table S1, Figure 1e, and Table S2). However,
26 CYP3A4 substrates, including 24 clinically available drugs, displayed
a greater degree of metabolic stability (LipMetE 0.024–3.85).
Theophylline exhibited a LipMetE of 3.05 mainly due to its poor in
vitro clearance (log10Clint,u −3.08)
and lower log D7.4 (−0.03)
as compared to log D7.4 and in
vitro clearance values of the remaining CYP3A4 substrates. Docetaxel,
loperamide, and mifepristone displayed higher LipMetE values of 3.04/3.18/3.84
mainly due to higher log D7.4 (3.54/3.94/5.19)
values. The CYP3A4 substrate, meloxicam, exhibited a LipMetE value
of 2.5 with log D7.4 and log10CLint,u values of 1.04 and −1.51, which
reflects an overall balance of the LipMetE, log D7.4, and in vitro clearance profile (Figure 1e).

Furthermore, it is
also important to establish meaningful relationships
between the calculated parameters presented in this study. Generally,
it is shown that the metabolic clearance of lipophilic compounds increases
with an increase in lipophilic character due to the lipophilic substrate
binding site of cytochrome P450 enzymes.48 Similarly, a reduction in lipophilicity normally leads to reduced
metabolic clearance and greater metabolic stability; yet there is
considerable variation in this correlation in various investigations.
For a series of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, a direct
correlation (r = 0.87) has been observed between
lipophilicity and plasma clearance.49 Similarly,
Rand et al. demonstrated a considerable trend of increased metabolic
clearance with an increase in log D7.4 values, while optimizing the pharmacokinetic and structural properties
for a series of 16 cyclic peptides having diverse therapeutic properties.50 Additionally, a direct correlation has also
been established between the log D7.4 and metabolic clearance values in humans for a set of neutral compounds
with metabolic clearance values in the range 0.01–1000 mL/min/kg
and log D7.4 values between −2
and 5.51 However, a weak trend toward increase
in clearance with lipophilicity in humans has also been noted for
670 intravenously administered drugs and clinical candidates.52

Herein, a direct correlation between log D7.4 and intrinsic clearance has been identified
in the
CYP3A4 substrates, including the marketed drugs that reside in the
LipMetE range between 0 and 1 as well as for those substrates that
reside in the LipMetE range of >2, as shown in Figure 1e. This is in line with the
previous relationship
established by Smith and Waterbeemd who explicated that metabolic
clearance of the CYP3A4 substrates can be reduced by lowering the
lipophilicity, irrespective of the structure or reaction types through
which metabolism occurs. Moreover, they observed a very good correlation
(r2 = 0.877) between log D7.4 and metabolic clearance values of 14 substrates
of CYP3A4, mainly drug compounds.51,53 Overall, in
the present investigation, a poor or no correlation has been observed
between intrinsic clearance (log10CLint,u) and
log D7.4 of the entire dataset
of CYP450 substrates, as shown in Figure S3. However, known drugs and model substrates of the respective CYP450
subtypes show a direct correlation between intrinsic clearance (log10CLint,u) and log D7.4 within a given range of LipMetE values, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Plot showing a direct
correlation between intrinsic clearance (log10Clint,u) and log D7.4 values for the
particular range of LipMetE for the marketed
drugs and model substrates metabolized by CYP450s (CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4).

Previously, several investigations have also reported
the dependence
of ADME properties on lipophilicity. Yoshida et al. analyzed a dataset
of 232 drugs with human pharmacokinetics data and revealed higher
bioavailability for compounds having log D7.4 values between 2 and 3.54 In contrast to this, a study by Paul Gleeson reported that no clear
relationship exists between lipophilicity and oral bioavailability
in rat for more than 4400 preclinical compounds. Moreover, a weak
relationship between lipophilicity (c log P) and clearance has been observed with more lipophilic
compounds clearing more rapidly, thus showing lower metabolic stability
although some dependence on the ionization state of the compounds
has been observed.9 A similar trend has
been observed in our study, where an increase in metabolic stability
(LipMetE) has been observed with a decrease in intrinsic clearance
(log10CLint,u) of the CYP450 substrates, as
shown in Figure 3.
This may reflect that high lipophilicity is associated, in part, with
increased metabolic rate by the CYP450 enzymes in liver microsomes,
although many other factors are involved in clearance mechanisms.9

2.2 Lipophilic Efficiency (LipE)
Lipophilic
efficiency (LipE) profiling of the CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,
and CYP3A4 substrates (Figure 4a–e) has been performed to normalize the lipophilicity
with respect to the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) values of the datasets (Table S2). The LipE and c log P distribution profiles of the respective CYP450 isoforms are provided
in Figures S4 and S5, and the detailed
LipE analysis of 58 CYP1A2 substrates is discussed in Section S1 of the Supporting Information. It
has been observed that most of the drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 span
the LipE range of −0.11 to 3.84 with Km values of 0.87–3440 μM and c log P values in the range −0.07
to 5.3 (Figure 4a, Table S2). This observation is retained with
the exception of a few highly lipophilic marketed drugs, including
amitriptyline and pimozide, that exhibit higher c log P (4.85/6.4), positive LipMetE
(0.108/1.81) but negative LipE (−0.78/–1.96) values,
which might be due to their higher c log P values. Overall, the difference in LipE values of the
CYP1A2 substrate dataset, mainly drugs (−0.11 to 3.84) from
the LipE value range (5–7), for an average oral drug defined
by Leeson and Springthorpe11 against a
drug therapeutic target might be due to the difference in potency
(Ki, IC50) values of the drugs
against the true therapeutic target as compared to Km values against CYP1A2. Thus, it reflects that the CYP1A2
substrates (drugs) exhibiting LipE values between 1 and 3 and c log P values in the range
−0.07 to 5.3 may offer better metabolic reactions and metabolic
stability.

Figure 4 LipE profiling of (a) CYP1A2, (b) CYP2C9, (c) CYP2C19, (d) CYP2D6,
and (e) CYP3A4 substrates. Data points labeled in red in LipE profiling
plots indicate CYP450 substrates with metabolic stability between
0–4 (LipMetE) and optimal LipE values.

Our results for 55 CYP2C9 substrates
indicate that
about 27% of substrates that are principally metabolized by CYP2C9
exhibit LipE values ≥2, as shown in Figure 4b, with only three substrates (a dietary
flavonoid, lornoxicam, and sildenafil) displaying LipE ≥3 (details
in Section S1). However, the LipE values
of metabolically stable CYP2C9 substrates (LipMetE: 0.066–2)
vary from −0.83 to 2.72. The CYP2C9 substrates including meloxicam,
7-ethoxycoumarin, and kaempferide display LipMetE/LipE values of 1.05/2.73,
0.74/1.65, and 0.69/2.39, respectively. Generally, it is observed
that the CYP2C9 substrates exhibiting LipMetE values from 0.0 to 2.5
lie within the LipE range of 0–2.7, whereas with an increase
in LipMetE values above 3, a negative LipE value has been observed
due to low intrinsic clearance. Thus, a compound with higher LipE
might indicate more affinity toward the substrate binding sites of
CYP2C9 that in turn shows more intrinsic clearance, lower metabolic
stability, and rapid metabolism turnover, which may represent a clinically
inadequate candidate.

The LipE profiling of the CYP2C19 substrates (Section S1, Table S2, and Figure 4c) revealed only
one hexobarbital enantiomer
with a LipE value of 5.13, c log P value of −0.78, Km value
of 45 μM and a very low LipMetE value (−3.79). Similarly,
three other hexobarbital enantiomeric CYP2C19 substrates exhibit LipE
values >4 and LipMetE values between −5.69 and −4.86
(Figure 4c). Thus,
this also reflects a trend of increase in LipE with decrease in metabolic
stability, which is also observed for the substrates of CYP1A2 and
CYP2C9. However, for the CYP2C19 substrates with higher LipMetE, lower
LipE values were observed as shown for the low-affinity substrates
flunitrazepam and diazepam (Km values
of 89 000/74 000 μM) that exhibit exceptionally
high LipMetE values (3.90/3.2), but the respective LipE values turn
out to be −0.72 and −1.83. Considering only metabolically
stable CYP2C19 substrates, zolpidem reflects a good balance of LipMetE
(1.37), LipE (0.79), and c log P (3.03), which might display an overall better substrate
profile.

For the CYP2D6 dataset of 73 substrates
only one compound
β-carboline harmaline presented a LipE of 5.14 (Figure 4d, Section S1, and Table S2). Debrisoquine exhibited a higher LipE of
4.73 (Km: 13.4, c log P: 0.14) and a negative LipMetE of −4.70. However,
for other substrates including chlorpheniramine and the experimental
N-substituted amphetamine analogues ((+) MDMA) and ((-) MDMA), LipMetE
values of −1.8/–5.72/–5.47, LipE values of 3.65/4.0/3.64,
and c log P values
of 0.77/1.85/1.85 have been observed. A similar trend of increase
in metabolic stability with decrease in LipE has been observed in
the case of dextrorphan and loperamide, which show LipMetE values
in the range of 2.19–2.92 and LipE values between −1.14
and 0.89. Overall, for the CYP2D6 substrates with better metabolic
stability (LipMetE: 1–2), it was observed that the LipE values
lie between 0.91 and 2.17 with the exception of imipramine, which
shows a LipMetE of 1.94 and a negative LipE (−0.15), mainly
due to its high c log P (5.04) and high affinity Km of 12.9
μM.

The detailed LipE analysis of the CYP3A4 substrates
is discussed in Section S1 and Table S2 of the Supporting Information. The CYP3A4 substrate, etoposide,
exhibits a LipE of 4.08 and poor metabolic stability (LipMetE: −1.18).
Additionally, loperamide and theophylline display very high metabolic
stability (LipMetE: 3.26/3.05) and low LipE (0.54/1.63) values. Thus,
it further strengthens our observation of increase in metabolic stability
with decrease in LipE of the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and CYP3A4 substrates,
as shown in Figure S6. Therefore, the optimization
of a compound’s lipophilicity may guide to improve bioavailability-
and clearance-associated problems. Toward this goal, Nassar et al.
reported different strategies for enhancing metabolic stability, which
includes reduction of the overall lipophilicity of a compound and
addition or modification of metabolically labile groups.55 However, metabolic stability problems solved
by applying structural modifications might not necessarily lead to
a compound with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, optimization
of lipophilicity that supports good bioavailability, metabolic stability,
clearance, and binding affinity of a substrate with the respective
enzyme (Km) might assist in achieving
the highest quality clinical candidate.

2.3 Ligand Efficiency (LE)
Finally, the
ligand efficiency (LE) values for substrates with suitable metabolic
stability and clearance have been evaluated to estimate the binding
free energies of compounds within the substrate binding sites of the
respective CYP450 subtypes. Binding free energies (ΔG) and LE ranges of the respective CYP450 substrates, including
marketed drugs, are summarized in Table 2. Overall, for our CYP450 substrate datasets,
LE values from 0.065 to 1.42 (Figure S7 and Table S2) and ΔG values from −10.45
to −1.49 (Table S2) have been observed.
Hopkins et al. reported an LE value of 0.29 kcal/mol/HA for an average
oral drug, exhibiting an optimal fit within the binding site of the
respective therapeutic target.36 However,
the metabolically stable substrates of the respective CYP450 isoforms
in our datasets show LE values between 0.064 and 0.6 with ΔG values from −8.23 to −1.48, which depicts
their conducive fit within the substrate binding site of CYP450.

a The average values of LipE, ΔG, LE, and c log P against each CYP isoform were calculated using all marketed
drugs and model substrates included in each CYP substrate dataset.

The analysis of successful drugs that are efficiently
metabolized
by CYP450 subtypes facilitated the favorable thresholds of LipMetE,
LipE, and LE for an average oral drug with a suitable metabolic profile.
Generally, for the CYP450 substrates, the LipMetE of 0–2.5,
LipE of −0.50 to 3, LE >0.25, and c log P of 1–3 might reflect important thresholds for the
suitable metabolic parameters of a new chemical entity. The CYP450
substrates from all datasets are presented in Figure 5 as points in the 3D space mapped according
to the respective LipE, LipMetE, LE, and c log P properties. Figure 6 shows our CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 datasets,
where compounds fulfilling the established thresholds are color-coded
in green. However, a deviation for the substrates of each CYP450 subtype
from these thresholds is depicted by red color. Most prominently,
the study identifies the CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4
substrates representing optimal metabolic properties. The identified
substrates with suitable metabolic attributes for the selected CYP450
subtypes are presented in Table 3 (Figure 6). The current study estimates the overall properties of CYP450 substrates
through the calculation of efficiency metrics. Therefore, these parameters
might serve as valuable tools to aid the selection of high-quality
or drug-like clinical candidates through the optimization of lipophilicity,
which supports the proposed metabolic stability, clearance, and binding
affinity of a substrate with the respective enzyme (Km).

3 Conclusions
Drug efficiency metrics
have commonly been applied to compounds
with potency values (Ki, IC50) against one or multiple therapeutic targets. Herein, these efficiency
metrics have been applied to the antitargets, CYP450 enzymes, to probe
the overall metabolic efficiency in terms of metabolic stability (LipMetE),
in vitro clearance, and log P/log D7.4. The optimization of lipophilic metabolic
stability (LipMetE) of a new chemical entity (NCE) with respect to
lipophilicity and in vitro clearance may advocate a reasonable concept
to estimate the CYP450 substrate properties. Therefore, LipMetE calculations
have been performed to provide a LipMetE threshold for the CYP450
substrates with suitable metabolism, intrinsic clearance, and lipophilicity
that may offer better metabolic properties of new chemical entities.
Here, we propose a LipE threshold of ≤3, LipMetE of 0.0–2.5,
and c log P of 1–3
for metabolically suitable compounds. Substrate binding sites of CYP450s
are considered lipophilic in nature, and thus, within a given range
of LipMetE, an increase in metabolic clearance has been achieved with
an increase in lipophilic character of substrates. Our results also
demonstrate that if a compound shows the already established threshold
of lipophilic efficiency (5–7) against an antitarget, such
as CYP450, it may show more affinity toward the substrate binding
site that in turn shows lower metabolic stability and rapid metabolism
turnover, which may not be suitable for clinical investigations. Overall,
our study estimated an approximate drug metabolic stability from its
log D7.4 and intrinsic clearance
values, although it is important to emphasize that other factors might
also be involved in binding affinity/metabolic stability, such as
polarity, hydrogen bond donor and/or acceptor properties, and the
number of aromatic rings present in the molecule. Nevertheless, the
consideration of the calculated parameters could facilitate the process
of NCE candidate selection during drug discovery and, thus, aid in
the overall right safety of the five-“R” concept.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Database Collection
A dataset of
291 CYP450 substrates, including 43 CYP1A2, 43 CYP2C9, 54 CYP2C19,
65 CYP2D6, and 86 CYP3A4 substrates, with known Km (0.011–89 000 μM), Vmax values (0.973–5.791 × 10+14 pmol/min/mg), and protein concentration (Cprot (1.2 × 10–11–2 mg/mL)) was
used for LipMetE calculations (Table S2). As the LipE and LE calculations do not require Vmax and Cprot values, more
compounds exhibiting Km values were added
to the existing datasets for LipE and LE profiling. Figure S8 gives an overall representation of the datasets,
including marketed drugs, model substrates and other substrates, used
for LipMetE, LipE, and LE calculations. The overall distribution of Km values against each CYP450 subtype indicates
that a greater number of high-affinity substrates (Km 0–100 μM) are present in each dataset in
comparison to low-affinity substrates (Km > 100 μM), as shown in Figure S9.

4.2 Lipophilic Metabolic Efficiency (LipMetE)
LipMetE is a novel parameter that takes into account the intrinsic
clearance of a compound to decipher the relationship between compound
lipophilicity and metabolic stability. Since datasets for LipMetE
profiling were extracted from various studies, unit conversion calculations
have been performed to homogenize our datasets (Km (μM), Vmax (pmol/min/mg),
and Cprot (mg/mL)). The intrinsic clearance
(CLint,app) was calculated for each CYP450 substrate dataset
using eq 1, as described
by Rane et al.56 1  To correct the intrinsic clearance parameter
for nonspecific binding (CLint,u), the unbound fraction
in microsomal incubations (Fuinc) was calculated using eq 2 retrieved from Halifax
and Houston’s empirical model based on physicochemical properties.57 Finally, CLint,u was calculated for
the entire datasets using eq 3.37 2   3  Log D7.4 values were obtained from ChemSpider (http://www.chemspider.com/), which were determined using ACD/Labs Percepta Platforms PhysChem
module.58 The lipophilic metabolic efficiency
(LipMetE) parameter was calculated as described by Stepan et al.37 (eq 4) 4  

4.3 Lipophilic Efficiency (LipE)
Lipophilicity
plays an important role in determining the ADME-Tox properties and
binding affinity of compounds to their targets. Therefore, lipophilic
efficiency (LipE) metric takes into account both potency and lipophilicity
for the evaluation of a compound’s drug-likeness.36 Herein, this concept was applied to substrates
of the selected CYP450 subtypes (antitargets) having major contribution
in drug metabolism. LipE profiling was performed to identify better
substrates of the CYP450 family of enzymes with best Km and lipophilicity ratio (eq 5). 5  The Bio-Loom software package59 was used for calculating the c log P values of the entire datasets, whereas the LipE calculations
were performed using the Excel spreadsheet.

4.4 Ligand Efficiency (LE)
Ligand efficiency
(LE) metric has been originally used to decipher a ligand’s
affinity toward its target and is measured as the ratio of binding
free energy (ΔG) to the number of heavy atoms
(HA).60 Binding affinity of the CYP450
substrates has been associated with the metabolic turnover and body
clearance.61 Therefore, to normalize binding
affinities of the CYP450 substrates with respect to heavy atom count,
the LE values for the entire substrate datasets have been computed,
as explained by Hopkins et al. and Jabeen et al.60,62Equation 6 was used
to calculate the free energies (ΔG) for the
CYP450 substrates, as explained by Kuntz et al.63 The equation is based on the assumption that enzyme–substrate
dissociation constant (Kd) is approximately
equal to the kinetic parameter, Km. Therefore,
the Km values can be substituted for the Kd values, as described by Lewis et al. and Bauer
et al.8,64 6  A temperature of 310 K was used to compute
the ligand efficiencies in kcal/mol/heavy atom. LE profiling was performed
using the expression (eq 7) 7  ΔG and LE values for
the substrates of each CYP450 subtype are shown in the Supporting
Information (Table S2). The Excel spreadsheet
was used to perform all LE calculations.
