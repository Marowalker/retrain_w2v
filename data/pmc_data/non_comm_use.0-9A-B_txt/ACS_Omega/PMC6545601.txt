An attempt has been
made to optimize the preparation of biodiesel
from the transesterification of oleic acid with methanol over iron(III)-doped
phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo) catalysts. The prepared doped
H3PMo salts were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
and scanning electron microscopy. The detailed characterization results
demonstrated that the doped H3PMo salts have a strong interaction
between the iron(III) ions and metal oxygen cluster, well preserving
a typical Keggin structure of heteropolyacids and possessing good
thermal stability. The effect of esterification reaction parameters
was investigated and optimized using single-factor experiments method
in combination with response surface methodology (RSM). The doped
catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity, affording the oleic acid
conversion of 89.2% with single factor optimization and 95.1% with
RSM. More importantly, the catalyst was simply separated by decantation
and exhibited good stability, with the oleic acid conversion of 70.2%
after three consecutive cycles. Besides, this catalyst can also catalyze
the esterification of other free fatty acids. Therefore, the doped
H3PMo catalyst is a promising candidate for eco-friendly
production of biodiesel in industry.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The gradual depletion
of the traditional fossil fuels increases
the environmental pollution and global warming, so more and more attention
is being paid to develop renewable fuels (e.g., biodiesel and biofuel).1,2 Biodiesel production from plant oils,3 animal fats,4 waste cooking oils,5,6 or free fatty acids (FFAs)7 is regarded
as a renewable green fuel owing to its clean, nontoxic, lower emissions
of carbon monoxide, and carbon-neutral characteristics. On the other
hand, it has similar physicochemical properties to conventional fossil
diesel, such as comparable lubricity and flash point cetane value,
and could be directly applied in engine without significant engine
modifications.8,9 In recent years, although the
use of homogeneous alkali hydroxides or alcoholates and solid-base
catalysts have become an effective method in the catalytic transesterification
synthesis of biodiesel,10 base-catalyzed
transesterification of raw oils with FFAs results in serious saponification
reaction, which reduces the biodiesel yield and influences the quality
of production.11 Therefore, conversion
of FFAs into fatty acid methyl esters via the esterification reaction
becomes a necessary and significant pretreatment process for raw oils
with high concentrations of FFAs. Homogeneous acids (such as H3PO4, HCl, and H2SO4) are
low cost and widely available and show excellent catalytic activity
in esterification. However, they suffer from problems of corrosive
to equipment, requirement of neutralization, and nonrecyclability
associated with product separation and purification, leading to the
increase in biodiesel production cost and relevant issues.12,13 Instead, solid-acid catalysts can overcome these drawbacks in esterification,
such as mixed-metal oxides,14,15 zeolites,16 metal complexes,17 and sulfonic acid functionalized solid acid.18 Unfortunately, they suffered from some drawbacks of low
acidity, weak interaction between active component and support, complicated
preparation process, and poor mass transfer.

Heteropolyacids
(HPAs) of the Keggin series, in particular H3PW12O40 (H3PW), H3PMo12O40 (H3PMo), and H4SiW12O40 (H4SiW), have drawn significant
attention as promising eco-friendly catalysts applied for various
organic transformations such as esterification, transesterification,
dehydration, etherification, oxidation, and acetylation reactions
due to their strong acidity, thermostability, and good oxidizing ability.19,20 However, HPAs is easily soluble in most of the organic solvents,
which restrains the catalyst recycling and product purification. Very
recently, the exchange of protons of HPAs with various cations (e.g.,
K+, Ag+, Cu2+, Mn2+) resulting
in the formation of insoluble salts could be an effective strategy
for the use of HPAs as solid-acid catalysts in green chemistry.21 Li et al.22 have
reported the optimization of the biodiesel preparation process from
Eruca sativa Gars vegetable oil catalyzed by Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 heteropolyacid salt. The heteropolyacid
salt shows an excellent catalytic activity for environmental biodiesel
production with a high yield of 99%. Interestingly, the Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 heteropolyacid salt
can be reused for six cycles. Su et al.23 reported that microwave-assisted the preparation of biodiesel from
yellow horn oil using Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 catalyst, and a high conversion yield (96%) could
be achieved. In our previous study, Ag+-, NH4+-, and Cu2+-doped HPAs were successfully used
as efficient catalysts in esterification reaction.24,25 As far as we know, the use of iron(III)-doped phosphomolybdic acid
(H3PMo) as a catalyst in esterification reaction for the
production of biodiesel is still lacking.

Moreover, various
parameters such as reaction time and temperature,
the molar ratio of feedstock to methanol, and the catalyst dosage
affecting the conversion are noteworthy. Compared to unplanned approaches,
the response surface methodology (RSM) helps researchers gain a better
insight into the interactions among experimental variables, offering
an optimization process and also saving research time and costs.26

Therefore, in the present work, we focus
on the design of iron(III)-modified
H3PMo catalysts used for the production of biodiesel in
the esterification reaction, and the modified catalysts were characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric
(TG), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Various esterification
reaction variables were optimized by single-factor experiments and
response surface experiments. Meanwhile, esterification of different
free fatty acids with methanol is also studied to validate the compatibility
of the doped H3PMo catalysts. Finally, the reusability
of the doped catalyst was also profoundly investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Catalyst
The powder XRD patterns of pristine H3PMo, Fe1/3H2PMo, Fe2/3H2PMo, and Fe1PMo are shown in Figure 1a. The pristine H3PMo shows principal
diffraction
2θ angles at 7.6, 8.8, 25.9, 26.7, 28.0, 32.2, and 35.0°,
which can be attributed to a body-centered cubic secondary structure
of Keggin anions.27,28 When iron(III) ions were added,
the diffractograms of Fe1/3H2PMo, Fe2/3H2PMo, and Fe1PMo show diffraction lines that
belong to those of triclinic symmetry for the crystal lattice. Besides,
these samples also exhibited some new strong peaks around at 20.0
and 33.0° associated with iron species,29−31 implying that
the heteropolyacid salt was formed, and Villabrille et al. also found
the same characteristic peaks for the iron-doped heteropolyacid.32 The FT-IR spectra of pristine H3PMo,
Fe1/3H2PMo, Fe2/3H2PMo,
and Fe1PMo are displayed in Figure 1b. The peaks of the Keggin structure were
clearly observed at approximately 1064 cm–1 (P–O
in the central PO4 tetrahedron), 963 cm–1 (Mo=O in the MoO6 octahedron), 874 cm–1 (Mo–Oc–Mo bridge, Oc: corner-sharing
oxygen), and 788 cm–1 (Mo–Oe–Mo
bridge, Oe: edge-sharing oxygen) in all samples, indicating
that the Keggin structure was well preserved in doped samples. Moreover,
for the Fe1PMo sample, its characteristic peaks of Keggin
structure were weaker than those of the Fe1/3H2PMo and Fe2/3H2PMo samples, this surprising
result may be because the iron(III) ions fully substituted the acidic
protons of phosphomolybdic acid that has a strong interaction between
the iron(III) ions and metal oxygen cluster.28,33 Therefore, the FT-IR results revealed that a good Keggin structure
retention was achieved after the iron-doped heteropoly cage structure.

XRD patterns and (b) FT-IR spectra of iron(III)-doped
H3PMo.

On the other hand, the
catalytic data for the Fe1/3H2PMo, Fe2/3H2PMo, and Fe1PMo
catalysts in the esterification are evaluated. Each reaction was performed
with 10:1 of methanol-to-oleic acid molar ratio, and 5 wt % of the
catalyst at 70 °C for 3 h. The results showed the conversion
was 87.5, 89.8, and 89.2% with the Fe1/3H2PMo,
Fe2/3H2PMo, and Fe1PMo catalysts,
respectively, implying the iron(III) cations that fully or partially
substituted H3PMo have better catalytic performance, with
no significant difference in the esterification rate. Thus, based
on the powder XRD and FT-IR, as well as catalytic activity of various
catalysts, the Fe1PMo solid-acid catalyst prepared by a
simple and convenient method was selected for the subsequent study.

TG analysis was used to test the stability of the catalysts. It
is demonstrated that the Fe1PMo catalyst was thermally
stable in the air up to 800 °C, as presented in Figure 2a. A slight weight loss (13.1%)
due to the vaporization of physically adsorbed water and thermal decomposition
of constitutional water (H3O+) from Fe1PMo in the range of 40–400 °C34 was also observed. Then, no additional weight loss of Fe1PMo catalyst was observed at the temperature of >400 °C,
presumably
due to the high thermal stability of the Keggin structure similar
to that of other heteropolyacid-based solid-acid catalysts.35−37

TG profile of Fe1PMo catalyst. SEM images of (b)
pristine H3PMo and (c) Fe1PMo catalyst.

SEM images of pristine H3PMo and Fe1PMo catalyst
are given in Figure 2b,c. There was significant morphological difference between the two
samples. The images exhibited that the pristine phosphomolybdic acid
has a large irregular shape and the surface morphology is rough. For
the Fe1PMo catalyst, the phosphomolybdic acid after doping
with iron(III) ions acquired a multilayered laminar structure morphology
but exhibited cubic shapes and some cracks. Thus, from the above observation,
the changing surface morphology of the Fe1PMo catalyst
was probably due to the exchange of protons with iron(III) ions, which
is consistent with previous reports.25

2.2 Single-Factor Experiments for Esterification
2.2.1 Effect of Methanol-to-Oleic Acid Molar Ratio
Since
the esterification of oleic acid with methanol is reversible,
excess methanol is significant to shift the equilibrium toward the
product side, thus improving the substrate conversion rate.38,39 In Figure 3a, it
is shown that the conversion of oleic acid is raised from 44.5 to
89.2% with the changing molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid from
2:1 to 10:1. This is because more amount of methanol could not only
promote the dispersion of the catalyst but also consolidate forward
reaction. However, further increase in the molar ratio of methanol
to oleic acid to 18:1 makes no difference in increasing the oleic
acid conversion for the limited equilibrium of esterification, and
similar result was also found by Ezebor et al.40 Taking energy consumption and operating cost into account,
10:1 was chosen as the optimum molar ratio for methanol to oleic acid.

Figure 3 Effects
of molar ratio (a), catalyst dosage (b), temperature (c),
and time (d) on the oleic acid conversion.

2.2.2 Effect of Catalyst Dosage
The relationship
between catalyst dosage and oleic acid conversion is shown in Figure 3b. As exhibited in Figure 3b, the oleic acid
conversion is slower without adding a catalyst, and 51.6% conversion
was obtained with the addition of catalyst in the dosage of 0.5 wt
%. When the catalyst dosage was increased from 1 to 5 wt %, the conversion
was gradually increased from 68.2 to 89.2%. This reason for this phenomenon
was that more catalyst could offer more active sites to activate the
substrate. However, the oleic acid conversion does not further increase
if the catalyst dosage keeps increasing to 6 wt % because of the equilibrium
limit. Meanwhile, a large catalyst dosage might lead to the dispersion
of active centers and worsen the partial coverage, and similar results
were reported by Wan et al.41 Therefore,
we selected 5 wt % as the optimal catalyst dosage for the following
studies.

2.2.3 Effect of Reaction Temperature
Esterification of oleic acid with methanol is the endothermic reaction,
which could increase the conversion rate through raising the temperature.
As exhibited in Figure 3c, low temperature severely hampers the esterification reaction and
the conversion is 60.3% at 20 °C. Then, an increase of the reaction
temperature from 30 to 70 °C distinctly heightens the oleic acid
conversion from 67.7 to 89.2%. If the reaction temperature is further
increased, the large amount of liquid methanol vaporized will reduce
the methanol concentration in the reaction system, probably resulting
in an unfavorable effect on conversion. Therefore, the optimum temperature
can be set at 70 °C.

2.2.4 Effect of Reaction Time
The effect
of reaction time on the oleic acid conversion was also studied, and
the results are exhibited in Figure 3d. It can be seen from Figure 3d that the oleic acid conversion increases
from 58.6 to 89.2% with the increment of reaction time from 0.5 to
3 h. However, there was no obvious increase in the conversion when
the time was above 3 h, and the oleic acid conversion of 90.8% is
obtained in 7 h. Therefore, the reaction time of 3 h was found to
be optimum when taking the production cost into account.

2.3 Statistical Analysis for Optimization of Fe1PMo Catalyst
for Esterification
2.3.1 Experimental Design and
Evaluation
The preliminary single-parameter studies imply
that catalyst dosage,
molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, and reaction time are significant
variables for biodiesel production. The effect of the three variables
was investigated by RSM, and a 3-level–3-factor Box–Behnken
Design including seventeen experiments were performed by a second-order
response surface. A second-order polynomial model (eq 1) was correlated with independent
variables as follows 1  where Cconversion is the oleic acid conversion
to biodiesel, β0 is
the intercept term, βi is the linear
coefficient, βii is the quadratic
coefficient, βij is the interactive
coefficient, and xi, xj are the coded independent variables (the reaction conditions).

The minimum and maximum values of the Box–Behnken Design
process variables are shown in Table 1. The Box–Behnken Design for the three process
variables X1, X2, and X3 with the experimental results
and predicted responses based on this RSM model are given in Table 2. The quadratic model,
describing the relationships between the predicted response variable
(conversion of methyl oleate at 70 °C) and the reaction conditions,
was selected for an in-depth statistical study. On the basis of the
results, the quadratic regression model of the experimental data (eqs 2 and 3) for the oleic acid conversion is given below 2   3

2.3.2 Model Regression and
Analysis
The
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the statistical significance of the
model is shown in Table 3. From Table 3, the
high value of R2 of 0.9894 for the response
implied that the model explained that about 98% of the experimental
data were compatible with the predicted data. The regression coefficient
of the predicted R2 was 0.8846 (>0.80),
and the adjusted R2 was 0.9758 was achieved;
the actual conversion was in reasonable agreement with the predicted
conversion. It has been summarized from the data that the model was
precise and reliable. The result of oleic acid conversion shows the F-value of 72.65, and a very low probability value (<0.0001)
indicated that this model was statistically significant. The F-value of the “lack of fit” was 2.44, indicating
that the model was not significant. Besides, the p-value of X1, X3, X12, and X32 terms had significant effects
on the oleic acid conversion. Other model terms were not significant.
Based on the above analysis, X1, X3, and X32 have positive effects, whereas the other variables have negative
effects.

2.3.3 Interactions among Variables
Three-dimensional
response surface plots (Figure 4a–c) show the interaction effect of the process-independent
variables with their response. Figure 4a shows the combined effect of the amount of catalyst
and the reaction time on methyl oleate conversion. Based on Figure 4a and as expected,
the oleic acid conversion was found to decrease with increasing reaction
time at a constant catalyst amount because of the reversibility of
the esterification reaction, and these also clearly demonstrated that
the effect of reaction time on oleic acid conversion was more than
the catalyst dosage. Moreover, the interaction between the molar ratio
(methanol to oleic acid) and reaction time on the conversion is given
in Figure 4b. According
to Figure 4b, an increase
in both methanol to oleic acid molar ratio and reaction time at 4.0
wt % Fe1PMo catalyst results in the increase of methyl
oleate conversion, implying the time and molar ratio had a positive
influence on oleic acid conversion. However, a slight decrease in
the conversion with the rise in methanol to oleic acid molar ratio
was also observed because excess methanol led to a relative reduction
in the active sites of the catalyst.42Figure 4c exhibits the interaction
of methanol to oleic acid molar ratio and catalyst dosage on methyl
oleate conversion. It was also observed that changes in the amount
of methanol affect the oleic acid conversion at a constant catalyst
dosage. Nonetheless, excess methanol was inadvisable because of the
resulting dilution of the catalyst and oleic acid.

surface plots for the esterification
of oleic acid with methanol with varying reaction parameters using
Fe1PMo catalyst: effect of reaction time and the catalyst
dosage (a); effect of molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid and the
reaction time (b); and effect of molar ratio of methanol to oleic
acid and the catalyst dosage (c).

2.3.4 Optimum Reaction Conditions
Optimization
of the esterification process to maximize oleic acid conversion was
performed using the Design-Expert software. Meanwhile, based on various
factors' influence on the design issues such as energy consumption,
the operating and circulation costs, the assurance safety devices,
etc.43 The optimum conditions were found
to be 3.9 h, 5.0 wt % of catalyst, and 12.54 molar ratio of methanol
to oleic acid, and these optimum conditions were validated by the
triplication of the experiments. The results showed that the predicted
and experimental values of oleic acid conversion were found to be
95.99 and 95.1%, respectively, indicating they were close to each
other.

2.4 Reusability
The
reusability and stability
studies of heterogeneous catalyst are of great significance. To test
the catalyst, the oleic acid esterification reaction was conducted
under optimal conditions: reaction temperature of 70 °C, the
molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid of 10:1, catalyst dosage of
5 wt %, and reaction time of 3 h. After the first production cycle,
the catalyst was simply separated by decantation and subjected to
direct reuse in a new oleic acid esterification reaction cycle for
five times, and the results are exhibited in Figure 5a. As presented in Figure 5a, the catalyst keeps its activity for the
third use (89.2% in first reuse versus 70.2% in third reuse). However,
with continuous increment of reuse cycles, the oleic acid conversion
drops sharply. After five cycles, only 41.5% conversion is obtained.
Meanwhile, different variations are observed in the FT-IR spectra
between the fresh catalyst and the fifth reused catalyst in Figure 5b, indicating that
the significant decrease in oleic acid conversion in the fifth cycle
compared to that in the first cycle can be mainly attributed to the
change in the Keggin structure of the catalyst. This might occur due
to the loss of catalyst and the blockage of the channel during each
cycle. Thus, from the above observation, the Fe1PMo catalyst
can show good stability during esterification.

methanol to oleic acid = 10:1, reaction temperature = 70 °C,
catalyst dosage = 5 wt %, and reaction time = 3 h. The comparison

2.5 Catalytic
Activity of Fe1PMo for
the Esterification of Other Substrates
Esterification of
different free fatty acids (high free fatty acid, nonedible oils)
with methanol was performed over Fe1PMo to test the generality
of this doped catalyst. The conversion of lauric acid, myristic acid,
palmitic acid, and stearic acid was 92.4, 89.1, 92.7, and 90.9%, respectively,
and the catalytic tests on high acid value Jatropha curcas crude oil
with methanol showed the pre-esterification rate of 90.6%. These results
show that the Fe1PMo catalyst has great potential to catalyze
various esterification reactions for industrial biodiesel production.

3 Conclusions
The present work studied the
preparation and utilization of iron(III)-doped
H3PMo catalysts for the production of biodiesel. The findings
revealed that the Fe1PMo catalyst gave good catalytic activity
for the conversion of oleic acid with methanol to biodiesel. Moreover,
the various esterification reaction parameters were then optimized
to obtain maximal conversion, and a high conversion of 89.2% can be
achieved with single-factor optimization and 95.1% with RSM. In addition,
the stability of the as-synthesized Fe1PMo catalyst was
studied, and it showed good reusability. Thus, the Fe1PMo
catalyst could be an environmentally benign and efficient catalyst
for the production of biodiesel at an industrial scale.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Oleic
acid (AR), methanol
(AR, >99%), lauric acid (AR, 98%), myristic acid (AR, 98%), palmitic
acid (AR, 98%), stearic acid (AR, 98%), phosphomolybdic acid (AR),
and iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Regent Co., Ltd. All
other chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received, unless
otherwise noted. Jatropha curcas seeds were purchased from Luodian
County, Guizhou Province, and the Jatropha curcas crude oil (JCCO)
was obtained through mechanical expression.

4.2 Preparation
of Iron(III)-Doped H3PMo Solid-Acid Catalyst
Iron(III)-doped
phosphomolybdic
acid catalyst was prepared according to the previous literature,25,33,44 with slight modifications. Briefly,
various calculated amounts of phosphomolybdic acid and iron(III) chloride
were dissolved in distilled water. Then, the aqueous solution of iron(III)
chloride was slowly added to the solution of phosphomolybdic acid
under vigorous stirring at room temperature for over 1 h. Subsequently,
the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 3 h and finally dried under
vacuum at 110 °C for 12 h to obtain the product as doped catalysts;
these as-prepared catalysts are designated as Fe1/3H2PMo, Fe2/3H2PMo, and Fe1PMo
according to the following equations 4  

4.3 Characterization of the
Catalyst
The XRD patterns of the catalysts were obtained
using a Rigaku D/max
2000 ultima plus diffractometer (monochromatic nickel filter, Cu Kα
radiation) and a step scan technique at 2θ angles of 5–80°.
The FT-IR spectra were scanned on a PerkinElmer spectrum 100 using
the KBr disk technique (4000–400 cm–1). TG
analysis was carried out with a Netzsch STA 449F3 instrument in dry
air at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The surface morphology of
the catalyst was studied using a JEOL-6701F scanning electron microscope
at 10.0 kV.

4.4 Procedure for Esterification
The
catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was tested through the
esterification of oleic acid (other free fatty acids and oils). Esterification
reaction of certain amounts of oleic acid, methanol, and Fe1PMo catalyst was performed in a 100 mL single-necked glass flask
immersed in a thermostatic oil bath equipped with a reflux condenser
and mechanical stirrer; no inert atmosphere was used and all reactions
occurred in contact with air and at ambient pressure. After esterification,
the used catalyst was simply separated from the liquid phase by decantation
and methanol was then removed by reduced pressure distillation to
purify the product. The acid value of the product was tested using
the national standard method ISO 660-2009, and the conversion was
calculated using eq 5. All data presented are averages of at least duplicate experiments. 5  where AV1 is the acid value of
