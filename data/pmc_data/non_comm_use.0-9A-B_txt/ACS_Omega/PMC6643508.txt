Making use of synergy between urea
and citric acid, a core–shell
Pd@CeO2 catalyst with spherical morphology was facilely
synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The formation mechanism of the
core–shell structure in the presence of citric acid and hydrogen
peroxide was studied. Results showed that the Pd@CeO2 catalyst
exhibited high catalytic activity in methane oxidation. Pd nanoparticles
were well stabilized by CeO2 shell encapsulation, resulting
in high stability of the catalyst. A high CH4 conversion
of 99% was retained after 50 h on-stream reaction at 500 °C.
Additionally, many tiny pores on the CeO2 shell surface
were beneficial for the full contact between reactants and active
components. Pd nanoparticles were highly dispersed inside the shell,
improving the utilization efficiency of active components. The results
also demonstrated that the Pd species in the catalyst existed in the
form of oxidation state, mainly in PdO (ca. 66.6%), which played an
essential part in methane combustion.

1 Introduction
Methane
is the main component of natural gas, which possesses the
advantages such as high practicability and low price. It produces
less carbon dioxide per unit of energy than diesel or gasoline, and
is known as a “green” alternative to these fuels. Thus,
it is more suitable for acting as a promising candidate for automotive
fuels.1,2 However, the direct emission of a small
amount of unburned methane will cause a much higher greenhouse effect
than carbon dioxide.3 Besides, as composed
with other hydrocarbons, the C–H bond (∼400 kJ mol–1) in CH4 is more stable and difficult to
be activated.4,5 Therefore, it is vital to exploit
an effective method to reduce methane emissions into the atmosphere.

So far, methane catalytic combustion is considered to be the most
effective, economical, simple, and clean method to reduce residual
methane in vehicle exhaust. In order to control such emissions, various
catalysts for methane catalytic combustion were studied and prepared,
such as precious metals,6−8 perovskites,9−11 and hexaaluminates.12,13 In general, non-noble metal catalysts show high activity for methane
oxidation only under the conditions of high temperature, high pressure,
or other harsh terms, which will result in the increase of pollutants
and more energy consumption. In contrast, the noble metal catalysts,
especially the supported palladium catalysts,14,15 exhibit high catalytic activity for methane complete combustion.16,17

Reversible adsorption and desorption of oxygen occur in the
process
of methane catalytic combustion over the supported Pd catalysts. In
addition, the nature of support is crucial for the catalyst properties,
which are closely related to the dispersity of Pd species on the support
as well as the interaction between Pd species and support.18−21 One suitable support is beneficial for the stability of the active
PdO phase, preventing the thermal decomposition and sintering of PdO
under high temperature.22,23 Meanwhile, catalyst
carriers also affect the ability of Pd to adsorb oxygen,24 in turn affecting the performance of the catalyst.
Therefore, high adsorption capacity to oxygen and good oxidation–reduction
properties of the catalyst carriers will be beneficial to the enhancement
of the catalyst performance.

CeO2 has been extensively
used to act as a carrier for
noble metal nanoparticles because of the excellent performance of
CeO2, such as good ability to disperse active components,
structural stability,25,26 and superior ability to store
and release oxygen.27,28 Among, Pd/CeO2 catalysts
are usually prepared to investigate the catalytic combustion properties
of methane.29,30 However, the low-temperature
catalytic activity and thermal stability over the Pd-based catalysts
were insufficient in the presence of a large amount of water vapor
and carbon dioxide. In recent years, many research studies have shown
that the reasonable design of the Pd species-metal oxide (MO) interface
is an effective method to improve the performance of Pd-based catalysts,
especially the core–shell nanostructured Pd@MO catalysts have
attracted extensive attention.31−35 Wang et al. developed the self-assembly of CeO2 on a
variety of Pd nanoparticles by using the biological molecule l-arginine as a sealing agent.33 Compared
with other CeO2 supported noble metal materials (NM/CeO2), NM@CeO2 with core–shell nanostructures
significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability of the
catalysts, which may be derived from the protection of precious metals
by the CeO2 shell preventing them from being transformed
in large quantities during long catalytic processes or under high
temperatures. Pd@CeO2 core–shell nanocomposites
by using tetrahydrofuran as solvents were synthesized and grafted
onto Al2O3 to obtain Pd@CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts by Cargnello et al., which demonstrated
that the sample showed high activity in methane catalytic combustion
and the chemical state of Pd nanoparticles could be stabilized through
the strong interactions between CeO2 and Pd.34 As mentioned above, it can be seen that the
formation of such a Pd@CeO2 core–shell structure
shows unique advantages in improving the performance of the catalyst.
However, at present, the synthesis process of Pd@CeO2 catalysts
is relatively complicated, the use of reagents as surfactants or solvents
is not environmentally friendly, and challenges still exist in the
regulation of catalyst morphology. Therefore, it is urgently needed
and meaningful to develop a green, simple, and suitable synthesis
method to obtain Pd@CeO2 catalysts with core–shell
nanostructures and specific morphology. Meanwhile, the formation of
strong interactions between CeO2 and Pd particles via the
reducible property of CeO2 is beneficial to prevent precious
metals from migrating and agglomerating at a high temperature, and
the protective layer formed by the CeO2 shell is good for
improving the stability of the catalyst. These promotion effects are
important to the methane combustion reaction.

Herein, one core–shell
nanostructured Pd@CeO2 catalyst with spherical morphology
was rationally designed for methane
catalytic combustion through a facile hydrothermal method with citric
acid as a complexing agent, hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant, and urea
used to adjust the formation rate of hydrogen peroxide radicals. The
influences of the catalyst morphology and the chemical state of Pd
species on the catalytic activity were discussed, as well as the catalytic
mechanism. It was found that the core–shell nanostructure formed
through a CeO2 shell encapsulating Pd nanoparticles played
an important role in the stabilization of the catalyst structures.
In addition, PdO acting as the main active sites in the catalyst dominated
the methane catalytic combustion reaction. The study provides a new
way to prepare the core–shell structure catalyst.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology Analysis
The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the catalysts prepared by different
synthetic methods were shown and compared in Figure 1. I–Pd/CeO2-600 exhibited
irregular spherical morphology (Figure 1A), with small particle size, uneven distribution,
and rough surface, while no specific morphology was observed for C–Pd/CeO2-600 (Figure 1B). For the catalyst prepared through the hydrothermal method, it
had relatively regular spherical morphology (Figure 1C,D), which was desirable in practical applications
for methane combustion. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the hydrothermal
treatment time has an obvious influence on the morphology as shown
in Figure S1. For the catalyst prepared
under 18–24 h hydrothermal treatment, relatively regular spherical
particles were obtained. As shown in Figure S1D, the particle size for H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) was around
1–2 μm for smaller particles and was around 3–4
μm for the larger ones. The microspheres may be self-assembled
from the secondary particles formed by primary particles under hydrothermal
conditions. In addition, obvious holes were formed on the surface
of H–Pd@CeO2-600(24), which may be due to the escape
of the gas produced by the decomposition of organic compounds.

Figure 1 SEM images
of I–Pd/CeO2-600 (A), C–Pd/CeO2-600 (B), and H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) (C,D).

As mentioned in the SEM analysis of Figure 1C,D, the microspheres with
a size in the
range of 1–2 μm prevailed in H–Pd@CeO2-600(24). In order to have an insight into the state of palladium
species, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution
TEM (HRTEM) analyses for those separated from the H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) microspheres were conducted, and the results were
shown in Figure 2A–D.
It can be found that the individual palladium particles were encapsulated
by CeO2 particles, indicating the formation of the core–shell
nanostructure with the PdO particle diameter of ca. 8.7 nm. The lattice
fringe spacings of core and shell were 0.26 and 0.31 nm, which were
ascribed to the (101) crystal plane of PdO and the (111) crystal plane
of CeO2 with the cubic fluorite structure, respectively.36,37 Combining with SEM characterization results, it was considered that
the prepared catalyst consisted of microspheres which were secondarily
assembled by CeO2 shell wrapping PdO nanoparticles. As
shown in Figure 2E–H,
high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) image and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping
analysis further confirmed the core–shell structured Pd@CeO2 nanoparticles with Pd particles uniformly distributing in
the core were successfully obtained through the hydrothermal method.

2.2 Structural
Properties
The results
of wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the catalysts prepared with
different methods and hydrothermal time are displayed in Figure 3A,B. The diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3°,
59.1°, 69.4°, 76.7°, 79.1°, 88.4°, and 95.4°,
which were detected all over the samples, were consistent with the
characteristic peaks of the CeO2 species with cubic fluorite
structures.38 Except H–Pd/CeO2-600(6), no diffraction peaks attributable to palladium species
were observed in other samples because of the good dispersion and
low loading amount beyond the detection limit. H–Pd/CeO2-600(6) exhibited an obvious diffraction peak near 33.9°
ascribed to tetragonal PdO(101),15,28 indicating
that increasing hydrothermal treatment time was conducive to the high
dispersion of Pd species. In combination with SEM images, it was rational
to conclude that PdO particles could not be well coated by the CeO2 shell for H–Pd/CeO2-600(6) so that the
PdO particles were aggregated and crystallized into larger particles.
On the basis of the results of CO pulse chemisorption (Table S1), it could be found H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) displayed a higher dispersion than other samples,
indicating that the structure of CeO2 shell wrapping Pd
cores in H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) was favorable for promoting
the dispersion of Pd species.39 The conclusion
was in agreement with the analysis of HAADF-STEM.

2.3 Catalytic
Performance
The catalytic
performance of the H–Pd/CeO2-600(t) catalysts synthesized under different hydrothermal treatment times
is depicted and compared in Figure 4A. It is noted that the H–Pd/CeO2-600(t) (t = 12–30) catalysts
exhibited no distinct difference in catalytic activities, while they
presented superior catalytic performances than the H–Pd/CeO2-600(6) catalyst. The consequence may result from the high
dispersion of active nanoparticles with smaller particle sizes for
H–Pd/CeO2-600(t) (t = 12–30) catalysts, which was confirmed from XRD analysis
(Figure 3A). For the
sake of further investigating the influence of morphology on catalytic
activity, activity, and stability tests were accomplished for the
H–Pd/CeO2-1000(12) and H–Pd@CeO2-1000(24) catalysts with a different morphology which was selected
as representatives. The CH4 conversion over H–Pd@CeO2-1000(24) and H–Pd/CeO2-1000(12) was maintained
∼99 and ∼95%, respectively, after reaction for 50 h
at 500 °C (Figure 4B). In combination with the stability result of the H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) catalyst (Figure 4B), it can be concluded that H–Pd@CeO2-600/1000(24) possessed superior temperature thermal stability than
H–Pd/CeO2-1000(12). This result may be due to the
relatively regular morphology for H–Pd@CeO2-600/1000(24),
which was beneficial to the mass and heat transfer of the catalysts,40 as well as anti-sintering of the nanoparticles.

Figure 4 (A) is
CH4 conversion over H–Pd/CeO2-600(t). (B) is stability test of H–Pd@CeO2-1000(12), H–Pd@CeO2-1000(24), H–Pd@CeO2-600(24), and I–Pd/CeO2-1000. (C,D) are
CH4 conversion over the catalysts synthesized by different
methods under dry feed condition and wet feed condition (15% extra
water), respectively. Dry feed: 2 vol % CH4, 4 vol % O2, and 20 vol % CO2 in N2 as balance
gas; GHSV of 100 000 mL h–1 g–1.

As displayed in Figure 4C and Table 1, H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) demonstrated
superior catalytic
performance than I–Pd/CeO2-600 and C–Pd/CeO2-600, which indicated that the activities for CH4 combustion varied with the synthesis methods. Among them, the T99 of H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) catalyst
was as low as 500 °C, while I–Pd/CeO2-600 and
C–Pd/CeO2-600 showed negligible catalytic activity
when the reaction temperature was below 500 °C. Figure S2A shows the catalytic performance of the samples
calcined at 1000 °C. It can be seen that the catalytic activities
decreased in the order H–Pd@CeO2-1000(24) > I–Pd/CeO2-1000 > C–Pd/CeO2-1000.

Table 1 Comparison of Methane Combustion Performance
of Catalysts Prepared by Different Synthetic Methods
catalyst	T10 (°C)	T50 (°C)	T90 (°C)	
CeO2	595	 	 	
I–Pd/CeO2-600	466	649	 	
C–Pd/CeO2-600	504	622	 	
H–Pd@CeO2-600(24)	307	406	465	
I–Pd/CeO2-1000	364	463	538	
C–Pd/CeO2-1000	528	 	 	
H–Pd@CeO2-1000(24)	308	408	467	
The results displayed that
H–Pd@CeO2-600/1000(24)
catalysts exhibited similar activity. For I–Pd/CeO2-T catalysts, I–Pd/CeO2-1000 exhibited
better activity than I–Pd/CeO2-600, which demonstrated
that the high-temperature heat treatment was beneficial to the promotion
of its catalytic activity. Besides, the methane conversion at 500
°C for I–Pd/CeO2-1000 fluctuated between 74
and 78% during 50 h on stream reaction. Whereas high-temperature calcination
was unfavorable to the catalytic activity for the catalyst synthesized
through a coprecipitation method. The consequence further provided
evidence that H–Pd@CeO2-T(24) demonstrated
higher thermal stability than I–Pd/CeO2-T and C–Pd/CeO2-T. The
enhanced stability of noble metal nanoparticles through the encapsulation
of the CeO2 shell have also been reported in previously
reported NM@CeO2 core@shell nanostructures.41,42 Additionally, H–Pd@CeO2-600/1000(24) also exhibited
good performance in comparison with those Pd-based catalysts previously
reported. The T90 value for H–Pd@CeO2-600/1000(24) at a space velocity of 100 000 mL h–1 g–1 was about 465 °C, which
is lower than T90 (545 °C) for PdO/CeO2@HZSM-5 operated at a low space velocity of 30 000
mL h–1 g–1.43

The influence of H2O on the catalytic
activities of
the catalysts was also investigated in the presence of 15 vol % H2O. Comparing the result of Figure 4D with that in Figure 4C, it can be found that the presence of 15
vol % water vapor had an inhibitory effect on the performance of the
catalysts regardless of the synthesis methods. Ciuparu and Pfefferle
pointed out that when the active sites existed in oxidation states,
the introduction of water could significantly inhibit the performance
of the catalyst for methane combustion.44 Gao et al. reported that the surface-active sites over Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were covered by hydroxyl groups in
the presence of water, resulting in the formation of inactive Pd(OH)2, thus the poisoning and inactivation of the active sites.45 Gao et al. also pointed out that the reactivation
effect with N2 was superior to that with air after removal
of water, which could be explained by that Pd(OH)2 decomposed
into PdO in the N2 feed but PdO2 in the air
and PdO2 species was normally considered to be less active
than PdO species. Therefore, it could be inferred that the active
sites on the as-prepared catalysts in this work might exist mainly
in the Pd oxidation states rather than the metallic states, thus the
catalytic activities were restricted by water.

In addition,
considering that CO2 was also the main
product of methane catalytic combustion, the influence of CO2 on the catalytic performance was also discussed. CO2 temperature-programmed
desorption (CO2-TPD) curves of the catalyst are shown in Figure S2B. It was clear that the desorption
temperature of CO2 increased in the sequence of H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) < I–Pd/CeO2-600 < C–Pd/CeO2-600. The lower desorption temperature and stronger peak intensity
of H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) indicated that H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) presented weaker basicity strength but a higher amount
of weakly basic sites, demonstrating that the catalyst surface had
abundant active sites for CO2 adsorption. The result demonstrated
that the strength of catalyst surface basicity had an obvious effect
on the catalytic activity. The existence of strong basicity sites
was conducive to the competitive adsorption of CO2 on the
catalyst surface, but not beneficial to the methane activation. Therefore,
H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) with the weaker strength of catalyst
surface basicity demonstrated higher catalytic activity. On the other
hand, because the desorption temperature of CO2 was all
lower than 300 °C, it could be speculated that CO2 had no obvious effect on the activities of the series of catalysts.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis
Chemical states and distribution of Pd species on the catalysts
prepared by different methods were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Figure 5A, two components of Pd species were detected over
all of the samples. The Pd 3d5/2 peak at 336.5 eV is assigned
to the PdO species, the peaks at 337.3–337.6 and 338.1 eV can
be attributed to the PdOx (1 < x < 2) and PdO2 species, respectively,28,46,47 indicating that only palladium
oxide species were present which were normally considered to act as
active sites in CH4 combustion. This result confirmed that
the reason for the activity difference of the catalysts in water-bearing
systems was that the main active species on the surface of the catalysts
were oxidized palladium species. As noted in Table 2, the content of Pd2+ reached
66.6% for H–Pd@CeO2-600(24), indicating that it
has more palladium species with +2 valence, while Pd species on I–Pd/CeO2-600 and C–Pd/CeO2-600 mainly existed in
the form of PdOx and PdO2.
Among the samples, H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) possessed higher
Pd2+ content, which was in line with the higher catalytic
performance. The result substantiated that the catalytic activities
may be mainly affected by the active PdO and PdOx species for methane combustion reaction, whereas the contribution
of PdO2 species was much smaller than those of PdO and
PdOx species.

Figure 5B shows
the Ce 3d spectra of H–Pd/CeO2-600(t) catalysts. The characteristic peaks of Ce 3d5/2 and
Ce 3d3/2 were labeled as u and v, respectively. The label
u′ and v′ peaks were corresponding to Ce3+, whereas the peaks denoted by u, u″, u‴, v, v″
and v‴ belonged to Ce4+.48 As shown in Table S2, the Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios over all of the catalysts were ranging from
6.9 to 21.3, demonstrating that Ce was mostly in a +4 oxidation state.
The amount of Ce3+ on the surface of H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) was relatively higher. This brought about more oxygen
vacancy,49 which would also boost the catalytic
activity for CH4 combustion. The results mentioned above
suggested that the core–shell structure of Pd@CeO2 provided more accessible active sites for the reactant (CH4).

2.5 Redox Properties
Figure 6A shows hydrogen temperature-programmed
reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of catalysts prepared by different
methods. One broad peak at 600–800 °C was observed on
the three catalysts, which could be assigned to the reduction of CeO2 lattice oxygen.50 On the basis
of the XPS results, the positive peak centered at 100–300 °C
of I–Pd/CeO2-600 and C–Pd/CeO2-600 was assigned to the reduction of Pd species in the oxidation
state (PdO or PdO2). The reduction temperature of Pd species
on C–Pd/CeO2-600 was obviously higher, which could
be attributed to the higher amount of PdO2, making it relatively
difficult to be reduced. For H–Pd@CeO2-600(24),
a negative peak at ca. 77 °C could be attributed to the decomposition
of PdHx formed by the chemical adsorption
of H2 by metallic palladium.51 Low-temperature H2-TPR profiles (Figure 6B) showed that H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) appeared an obvious H2 consumption peak at 10–40
°C, corresponding to the reduction of PdO and PdOx (1 < x < 2) species as well
as the formation of PdHx species. The
results indicated that the reduction trend of Pd species over different
catalysts was as follows: H–Pd@CeO2-600(24) >
I–Pd/CeO2-600 > C–Pd/CeO2-600.
Combined with the
activity results, the reducibility of the catalysts was in agreement
with the trend in catalytic activity, evidencing that higher reduction
ability would profit CH4 activation.

different methods.

2.6 Synthesis
Mechanism and Reaction Process
A possible synthesis mechanism
of H–Pd@CeO2-600(24)
was proposed as described in Figure 7. The surface of presynthesized Pd colloidal particles
which was negatively charged could adsorb Ce3+, and the
−COOH group of citric acid in the system would also bind to
Ce3+ ions. Urea was slowly hydrolyzed under hydrothermal
conditions and promoted the decomposition of H2O2 into hydrogen peroxide ions [HO2–]
or peroxy hydrogen radicals [HO2•]. During this process, part of Ce3+ ions was oxidized to Ce4+ ions, forming Ce(OH)3OOH, which was further condensed and dehydrated to form CeO2. In addition, within a certain period of hydrothermal time,
the reaction became more sufficient with treatment time. Through the
synergy of citric acid, CeO2 formed a thicker and thicker
coating around Pd particles, hence larger and larger nanoparticles.
When the reaction time was insufficient, it failed to hydrolyze all
cerium ions into hydroxides and form CeO2. Part of the
cerium ions which were complexed with citric acid could only form
CeO2 during the postcalcination treatment, resulting in
irregular morphology. Too long a reaction time might result in the
desorption of the formed small crystals or crystal nucleus, or the
formation of larger particles because of the overlapping or lateral
connection of the surface nucleation, thus causing the formation of
irregular morphology. The mechanism demonstrated that the control
of hydrothermal reaction time played an important part in a attaining
regular spherical structure.

Figure 7 Schematic of the formation of core–shell
structure and CH4 oxidation over the catalyst H–Pd@CeO2-T.

When the reaction atmosphere passed through the pores on
the CeO2 surface of the catalyst, CH4 reacted
with the
encapsulated active Pd species. As mentioned above, the presence of
regular spherical CeO2 shells effectively prevented the
agglomeration and sintering of Pd species to form large particles
and facilitated the dispersion of Pd species on the carrier. Therefore,
more active Pd species are involved in the methane combustion reaction,
leading to the enhancement of the catalytic activity.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, using the synergy between
urea and citric acid,
a core–shell structured Pd@CeO2 catalyst with uniform
spherical morphology was successfully synthesized by a green and facile
hydrothermal method. The active Pd species in the catalyst mainly
existed in the form of PdO accompanied by the presence of some PdOx (1< x < 2) oxides,
and the active Pd species were highly dispersed inside the spherical
CeO2 shell. The core–shell structure stabilized
the active PdO particles in the catalyst and improved the utilization
efficiency of the active component. The Pd@CeO2 catalyst
exhibited high stability, which maintained 99% methane conversion
after continuous reaction for 50 h at 500 °C. This work provided
a new idea for the further development of novel methane combustion
catalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
of Catalysts
The Pd@CeO2 catalysts were prepared
through a hydrothermal method as
follows. The preparation of the Pd precursor was according to the
reports by Wang33 and Xia.52 108 mg of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and 180 mg of citric acid
were dissolved in a water/ethanol mixture with a volume ratio of 5:3
at room temperature and the resultant solution was stirred at 80 °C
for 10 min. Afterward, a certain amount of palladium nitrate was added
to the above solution and the mixture was further stirred for 3 h
to form the Pd precursor solution. A mixture of cerium nitrate/urea/citric
acid with a molar ratio of 1:1:1 was dissolved in a water/n-butanol mixture with a volume ratio of 7:1 at room temperature
and the resultant mixture was stirred for 20 min, afterward, a certain
amount of hydrogen peroxide and Pd precursor solution were added (Pd
theoretical loading was 1%). The final solution was sealed into an
autoclave with a Teflon-lined, heated to 120 °C and maintained
for a period of time. After hydrothermal treatment, the precipitate
was centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol repeatedly
until pH ≈ 7, and subsequently dried at 60 °C for 7 h.
The as-prepared powders were calcined in air at 400 °C for 4
h with a ramping rate of 1 °C min–1 and then
treated at either 600 or 1000 °C for 2 h with the same heating
rate. The obtained product was denoted as H–Pd/CeO2-T(t), where T represented the calcination temperature (T = 600,
1000 °C) and t stands for hydrothermal treatment
time (t = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 h). Amongst, the sample
obtained under 24 h heat treatment was separately denoted as H–Pd@CeO2-T(24). For comparison, catalysts prepared
by the impregnation method and coprecipitation method were denoted
as I–Pd/CeO2-T and C–Pd/CeO2-T, respectively. Detailed synthesis methods
are described in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Sample Characterization
SEM images
were recorded using a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope equipped
with an energy dispersive X-ray detector. The acceleration voltage
and working current was 5 kV and 7 μA, respectively. TEM images
were performed on a FEI G2F30 transmission electron microscope at
300 kV. XRD measurement was carried out by a PANalytical Axios Petro
diffractometer using X’Celerator detector and Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15406 nm, 45 kV and 40 mA). The XPS experiment was performed
on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with Al Kα X-ray radiation
(1486.6 eV), and all the binding energies were calculated using the
C 1s peak as a reference at 284.8 eV. The XPS spectra were de-convoluted
through a Gaussian/Lorentzian curve-fitting strategy. The content
of Pd (or Ce) species with different valence states in the samples
was obtained by calculating the relative integrated areas under the
curve of each de-convoluted peaks.

CO pulse chemisorption, H2-TPR and CO2-TPD experiments of the catalysts (dosage:
100 mg) were all performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument.
For CO pulse chemisorption, before measurement, the sample was purged
by helium gas at 300 °C to remove impurities and moisture for
30 min, then prereduced in a 10 vol % H2/Ar flow (30 mL
min–1) at 300 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the measurements
were performed when the sample was cooled down to 30 °C. In the
case of H2-TPR, the sample was pretreated in the 3 vol
% O2/Ar flow (30 mL min–1) at 400 °C
for 40 min, and purged in He for 60 min, and then cooled to −30
°C with KWIKCOOL ASSEMBLY. The TPR profiles were monitored from
−30 to 900 °C in 10 vol % H2/Ar flow (30 mL
min–1) at a ramping rate of 5 °C min–1. In the case of CO2-TPD, the sample was pretreated under
He (30 mL min–1) at 300 °C for 1 h, and then
cooled down to 50 °C, afterward, CO2 flowed over the
sample for 1 h. The measurement was carried out from 50 to 800 °C
under He flow (30 mL min–1) with a heating rate
of 5 °C min–1.

4.3 Catalytic
Activity Test
The on-line
analysis of catalytic activity for methane combustion was conducted
using a continuous flow microreactor. The catalyst (0.045 g) was placed
in a fixed-bed quartz reactor and the temperature of the catalyst
bed was controlled by a K-type thermocouple. The fed gases containing
2 vol % CH4, 4 vol % O2, 20 vol % CO2 and N2 as balancing gas at a flow rate of 75 mL min–1, were passed into the catalyst bed with a gas hourly
space velocity (GHSV) of 100 000 mL h–1 g–1. The inlet and outlet gas concentrations were analyzed
with an on-line gas chromatograph fitted with a thermal conductivity
detector. The CH4 conversion (denoted as X) was calculated by the equation as follows  where [CH4]in: the inlet
flow of CH4 and [CH4]out: the outlet
flow of CH4.
