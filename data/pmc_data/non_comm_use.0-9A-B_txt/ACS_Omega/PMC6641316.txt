Dimension
and shape tunable architectures of inorganic crystals
are of extreme interest because of morphology-dependent modulation
of the properties of the materials. Herein, for the first time, we
present a novel impurity-driven strategy where we studied the influence
of in situ incorporation of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) on the growth
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor
crystals via a hydrothermal route. The GQDs function as a nucleation
site and by changing the concentration of GQDs, the morphology of
β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors
was changed from rod to flowerlike structure to disklike structure,
without phase transformation. The influence of size and functionalization
of GQDs on the size and shape of phosphor crystals were also systematically
studied and discussed. Plausible mechanisms of formation of multiform
morphologies are proposed based on the heterogeneous nucleation and
growth. Most interestingly, the experimental results indicate that
the photoluminescence properties of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals are strongly dependent
on the crystallite size and morphology. This study would be suggestive
for the precisely controlled growth of inorganic crystals; consequently,
it will open new avenues and thus may possess potential applications
in the field of materials and biological sciences.

1 Introduction
Rare
earth ion-doped phosphors possess potential applications such
as solid-state lasers;1 high-resolution
display devices, security and brand protection, photodynamic therapy;2 fluorescent labels for the detection of molecules;3 in vivo imaging;4,5 medical diagnostics,
fingerprint detection, and sensors;6,7 light-emitting
devices;8 solar cells;9,10 and
so forth which are better substitutes of conventional fluorophores
and organic dyes.11 Although the molar
absorption coefficient of organic dyes and quantum dots is comparatively
higher than that of the rare earth phosphors, high background noise,
high blinking probability, poor photostability, and potential long-term
toxicity hamper the use of these materials.12,13 In contrast, the fascinating luminescence features of lanthanide
ions arising from intra 4f transitions such as narrow bandwidth, long-lived
emission, large Stokes and antiStokes shift, less blinking, photostability,
and low autofluorescence offer excellent prospects for designing new
luminescent materials with enhanced properties.14,15 Among the phosphors, β-NaYF4 has been demonstrated
as the most efficient host for upconversion (UC) and downconversion
(DC) emissions because of its low phonon energy (∼350 cm–1), high chemical stability, good optical transparency,
high radiative emission rates, and low nonradiative decay rates.16

In recent years, the design and the synthesis
of inorganic nano-/microcrystals
with well-defined morphologies and accurately tunable sizes remain
the research focus as the precise control over shape and size allows
manipulation of the physical, chemical, and biological properties
of the nanocrystals as desired. Therefore, it is essential to develop
efficient methods to fabricate multiform inorganic crystals to enhance
their performance in existing applications. In the last decades, various
efforts have been dedicated to synthesize the rare earth ion-doped
phosphors in uniform but different sizes and shapes.17 In the kinetic control of the growth process of crystals,
various external factors, such as concentration and types of precursors,
reaction time/temperature/pressure, types of solvents, pH of precursor
solution, and organic additives, drastically influence the shape of
the crystals.18 All of these factors have
been studied quite intensively. A large number of organic additives
and shape-directing agents such as oleic acid,19 polyethylene glycol,5,20 trisodium citrate,21 cetyltrimethylammonium bromide,22 dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide,23 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,24 poly(4-styrenesulfonate),25 and so forth are used to control the particle
size and tune the crystallinity and morphology of the anisotropic
crystals. These agents selectively bind to the different facets of
the crystals and change their surface energy and chemical potential,
which affects the orientation growth rate of different crystal facets,
resulting in the formation of different architectures under various
environments.17 Adjusting the molar ratio
of a complexing agent/rare earth ion can also tune the crystal size
and shape.26 Commercially available ligands
such as polyvinylpyrrolidine and polyethylenimine (PEI) are used to
control the particle growth of the nanocrystals and endow them with
surface functionality for further modification.27 Various impurity dopant ions such as K+, Li+, Zn2+, Sc3+, and Gd3+ have
been used intensively to study the change in phase and morphology.
In a study by Dou and Zhang in 2011, Li+-ion doping in
NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals showed
morphology change from nanorods to nanospheres along with the change
in phase from hexagonal to cubic, when the doping percentage increased
till 60%. While when K+ ions were doped in the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals, morphology
changed from elliptical shape to hexagonal prism and finally to nanorods
as the K+ content was increased in the system.28 Similar to other studies, a mechanism was proposed
for the influence of the molar ratio of K+ to Y3+ on the anisotropic growth and morphology evolution of β-NaYF4 nanocrsytals.29 In the same way,
Li+ ions were incorporated in the KSc2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals, which substituted
K+ or Sc3+ ions at lower doping concentration,
whereas some of the Li+ ions went into the interstitial
site of the crystal lattice at higher doping concentration. An increase
in size of the nanocrystals with 60 mol % of Li+-ion doping
was observed.30 In 2013, collective effect
of different alkali metals onto the formation of multiform morphologies
of rare earth fluorides was also studied by Xue and co-workers.31 While Chen et al. studied the influence of Gd3+ ions on the phase transformation of NaYF4 crystals
from cubic to hexagonal phase and also observed decrease in luminescence
intensity because of the decrease in the size of the nanorods with
higher Gd3+ doping.32 Hitherto,
numerous methods have been reported to fabricate the anisotropic nanoparticles
such as rods, plates, prisms, tubes, spheres, disks, and spindles,
and so forth. These methods include solvothermal, coprecipitation,
thermal decomposition, combustion, and sol–gel process, among
which hydro-/solvothermal method is considered a relatively environment-friendly
method which provides high crystallinity and monodispersity to the
material with diverse controllable morphologies and architectures.11 Apart from the homogeneous nucleation, the crystal
growth strategies based on the heterogeneous nucleation are quite
popular. The choice of substrates provides an ideal nucleation site
by lowering the activation energy barrier for the phase to form. In
fact, the heterogeneous nucleation makes it possible for some metastable
crystalline states to form well below the supersaturation limit of
the monomer concentration.

In this article, we have investigated
the role of graphitic carbon
materials with varying surface functionality, size, and shape as a
nucleation site for the growth of NaYF4 nanocrystals. The
rationale behind using these materials was due to their versatile
application as the co-components in optically active hybrid materials
as well as their role in defining the crystalline and optical properties
of the crystals. Previously, our group reported the in situ insertion
of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) during the growth of TiO2 particles. Because of the presence of GQDs, irregular structures
of the TiO2–GQD hybrid were formed instead of regular
rodlike structure TiO2 particles.33 The carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes
(CNTs), GQDs, and so forth have attracted significant attention owing
to their advantageous properties such as high surface area, low density,
minimal cost, environment friendliness, and high thermal stability.
Carbon-based materials possess excellent mechanical strength, electrical
and thermal conductivity, and optical properties.34 The GQDs have grabbed more attention because of their chemical
inertness, solubility, tunable photoluminescence (PL), long-term photobleaching
resistance, biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity.35 The GQDs have carbon with sp2 hybridization
having one or few layers of graphene sheets with lateral dimensions
smaller than 100 nm36 and oxygen-containing
functional groups on their surfaces and at their edges. The GQDs are
called zero-dimensional graphene materials. The quantum confinement
of electrons has been demonstrated in GQDs and led to the practical
applications in bioimaging, lasing, photovoltaics, and light-emitting
diodes.37

Composites of carbon-based
materials have become important for
various applications because of their unique physical and chemical
properties. Various composites with GQDs have been synthesized such
as GQD with polyaniline composite films, which have applications in
photonic devices.38 The GQDs have also
been used as a co-sensitizer in the hybrid dye-sensitized solar-cell
architectures.39,40 In other studies, the amine-functionalized
GQDs (NH2-GQDs) were incorporated into the flexible and
transparent clay host and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs). The resultant
GQD@CNF–clay films exhibited PL; therefore, they were used
as a material for blue light-emitting diodes to achieve white light
emission.41

The development of multifunctional
hybrid materials of lanthanide
ion-doped phosphors is gearing tremendous interest for a broad range
of potential applications in biological and material sciences because
of their unique tunable electronic and magnetic properties.42 It is worth mentioning that a very few reports
of the composites of carbon-based materials and lanthanide ion-doped
phosphors are known till date for their sensing or photocatalytic
applications. New-generation nanocomposites of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and graphene oxide (GO) were fabricated
with superior optical limiting performance,43 followed by their mechanistic studies in the same year.44 Composites of reduced GO and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ were proposed to achieve good electrical
conductivity, which consequently increased the efficiency of the solar
cell by 10%.45 Fabrication of optical pH
sensors based on the flexible and biocompatible freestanding optical
hybrid film, which is composed of GO and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles (UCNPs), is reported. In this work,
high surface area, mechanical stability, and luminescence quenching
capability of GO are utilized as a sensing platform for pH sensing.46 In another work, TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+–graphene composite
photoanode was prepared, which improved the solar cell efficiency
by increasing the interfacial electron transport of fluorine-doped
tin oxide/TiO2.47 For biomedical
applications, multifunctional multiwalled CNT (MWCNT)–NaGdF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Eu3+ hybrid nanocomposite
was developed for simultaneous magnetic and optical imaging by NaGdF4:Yb3+/Er3+/Eu3+ NP and photothermal
conversion property from MWCNT.48 Recently,
a sensor based on GQDs and ssDNA-UCNP@SiO2 is developed
for the detection of microRNA sequence.49 Although the composites of Ln3+-doped phosphors and carbon-based
nanomaterials have been explored, the in situ incorporation of carbon-based
nanomaterials into the Ln3+-doped phosphors is not studied
yet.

Herein, we report a novel strategy to incorporate carbon-based
nanomaterials; for example, we used GQDs as a foreign impurity into
the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor
and studied their effect on the crystal phase, morphology, and optical
properties of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+. Interestingly, we observed that the in situ incorporation of GQDs
into the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors
has significantly influenced the morphology and consequently the optical
properties of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals. We have studied the effect of the concentration of GQDs,
the type of surface chemical functionalization, and CNTs on the morphology
and PL properties of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time,
we are reporting the morphology tuning of inorganic crystals via incorporation
of GQDs. This work has led to new opportunities of extending the use
of this system in the area of architectural manipulation.

2 Results and Discussion
Intentional incorporation of foreign
elements into the hosts has
a significant influence on the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals
(heterogeneous nucleation) by lowering the thermodynamic activation
energy barrier for the nucleation events to take place, which is influenced
by the several microscopic properties such as the crystal structure
of foreign elements and the precipitate, lattice mismatch between
two species, surface roughness, surface wetting properties, and so
forth from microscopic to the atomistic details. Thus, it provides
a unique approach to modify the crystallographic phase, size, morphology,
and consequently the optical properties of nanomaterials. Here, we
have incorporated varying concentrations of carboxylic and amine co-functionalized
GQDs (mentioned as GQDs) in β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals in the reaction vessel during
the synthesis itself. To investigate the effect of GQDs and other
carbon-based materials on the morphology of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals, we first characterized
the as-prepared GQDs and then studied the structural, morphological,
and optical properties of GQD-incorporated β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals.

2.1 Characterization
of GQDs
The size
and morphology of the as-prepared GQDs were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1a shows the TEM images of the GQDs having size in the
range of 3–5 nm. The concentration of the GQDs was calculated
from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10
°C/min under nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 1b), which was found to be 10 mg/mL. The UV–visible
absorbance (Figure 2a) showed the presence of broad absorbance in the UV range with a
knee around ∼230 nm because of π–π* transitions
of sp2 C=C bonds present in the GQDs, which is in
good agreement with the previous studies.50 The inset of Figure 2a shows the photograph of the as-prepared GQDs aqueous solution taken
under 365 nm UV light exposure. Detailed PL studies were carried out
at different excitation wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm. It
was found that the PL intensity first increased till 330 nm and then
decreased remarkably. The fluorescence emission peak of GQDs red-shifted
from 440 to 570 nm when the excitation wavelength increased from 250
to 550 nm. The highest intensity of the PL was observed for the GQDs
at 445 nm when excited at 330 nm. Raman spectroscopy was performed
at an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. Figure 2b shows the Raman spectrum where two well-resolved
peaks corresponding to D and G bands at ∼1340 and ∼1600
cm–1, respectively, were observed.

GQDs showing a particle size of 3–5
nm and (b) TGA curve showing the weight fraction of GQDs under inert
atmosphere.

Figure 2 (a) UV–visible
absorbance spectra showing a broad UV absorption
with a small knee at 230 nm and PL spectra at different excitation
wavelengths from 250 to 550 nm while the inset shows the photograph
of the GQD aqueous suspension taken under 365 nm UV light exposure
and (b) Raman spectra of the as-prepared GQDs using 633 nm laser as
a source.

The G band corresponds to the
E2g phonon at the Brillouin
zone center, whereas the disordered induced D band corresponds to
the transverse optical phonons around the K-point
of the Brillouin zone. The D band requires a defect for the momentum
conservation. The intensity ratio ID/IG of D to G band is greater than 1, suggesting
that the as-prepared GQDs have defects because of the dominant contributions
from the edge states at the periphery. The 2D band is a second-order
Raman process, which originates from in-plane breathing-like modes
of the carbon rings.51 The broadening of
the 2D band at ∼2800 cm–1 may be due to the
relaxation of the double-resonance Raman selection rules that are
associated with the random orientation of GQDs with respect to each
other.52 The broadness of this peak increases
with increase in the defect states in the system.

2.2 Structural and Morphological Investigations
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQDs
The composition, crystallinity, and phase
purity of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD phosphors were first examined by X-ray diffraction
(XRD). Figure 3 shows
the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized PEI-capped NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+, incorporated with different concentrations
of GQDs (x = 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 mL). The relative
intensity of the peaks is changed compared with that of standard data,
suggesting the probable anisotropic growth behavior of the particles.
The rationale behind using PEI in the synthesis of NaYF4 is not only to provide monodispersity to the particles but also
to prevent particles from agglomeration. Here, we used GQDs, in which,
as referred above, 1 mL of suspension is equal to 10 mg of GQDs. The
sharp diffraction peaks in all the samples can be indexed to the pure
hexagonal phase β-NaYF4 (space group: P63/m) with calculated lattice parameters a = 5.9 Å and c = 3.5 Å, which
are in good agreement with the reported data (JCPDS 16-0334). The
absence of any other peak in XRD patterns indicates the high purity
of as-prepared samples, implying that no secondary phase is formed.
The pure hexagonal phase of all the samples reveals that the incorporation
of GQDs at all concentrations does not induce the phase transformation
in the β-NaYF4 crystal structure. It is worth mentioning
that on comparing the peak intensities of the prepared samples, we
found that there is a difference in the relative intensities based
on (100), (101), (110), (002), and (201) peaks, indicating the existence
of different preferential orientation growths at different GQD concentrations.
The size, shape, and structure of the as-prepared samples were characterized
by TEM and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Figures 4 and 5). The TEM images, as shown in Figure 4, show that the as-prepared PEI-capped β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals possess a rod-shaped
structure with an average length of ∼280 nm and a diameter
of ∼96 nm. It can be seen that the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD (x = 0) rods are highly uniform and monodispersed in nature. Interestingly,
upon in situ incorporation of the GQDs into the PEI-capped β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors during the synthesis,
the variation in morphology was observed as a function of different
concentrations of GQDs. As it can be seen from Figure 4b,c, at the lower concentrations of GQDs,
that is, at x = 1 and x = 3, hexagonal
prismatic structures were formed with average lengths/diameters of
∼225 nm/∼130 nm and ∼280 nm/∼250 nm, respectively.
At x = 5, flower-shaped crystals were observed with
a length and a diameter of ∼325 and ∼300 nm, respectively
(Figure 4d). Whereas
the crystallites observed at x = 7 are composed of
disklike structures having an average length and a diameter of ∼260
and ∼620 nm, as shown in Figure 4e.

Figure 3 Comparison of XRD patterns of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD phosphor crystals
where x = (a) 0, (b) 1, (c) 3, (d) 5, and (e) 7 mL.
The standard data of
β-NaYF4 (JCPDS 16-0334) are also compared. Here,
1 mL of GQDs equals 10 mg by weight as calculated by the TGA curve.
The incorporation of GQDs does not induce any phase transformation
in the β-NaYF4 crystal structure.

Figure 4 TEM images of GQDs-incorporated β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ particles show the modification
of nucleation
and growth of these particles when the concentration of GQDs was varied
from x = 0 to 7 mL (a–e). The figures (f–j)
show their respective SAED patterns. All samples were hydrothermally
treated at 180 °C for 24 h.

Figure 5 FESEM images show the change in the morphology of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ after the incorporation of
GQDs where the concentration of GQDs was varied from x = 0 to 7 mL (a–e). With increase in the concentration of
GQDs, the aspect ratio (length/width) of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors decreased. NaYF4 rods were formed at 0 mL of GQDs with an aspect ratio of 2.9 and
disklike structures with an aspect ratio of 0.4 at 7 mL of GQDs.

These results strongly suggest
that the morphology of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD crystals
(x = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 mL) exhibited striking dependence
on the different concentration of the GQDs, where the shape changed
from rods (x = 0) to disklike structures (x = 7). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction
patterns (SAEDs) and high-resolution TEM images shown in Figure 4f–j and insets,
respectively, demonstrate that the as-synthesized β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD crystals
are highly crystalline in nature. Meanwhile, the lattice fringes with
an interplanar spacing of respective planes of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD crystals are
ascribed. The detailed observations with their proper facets at various
concentrations of GQDs in the as-prepared samples can be clearly seen
by the FESEM images (Figure 5). The FESEM images laid more evidence that the incorporation
of the GQDs had huge effect on the morphology of the as-prepared crystals.

It should be noted that the pH of the solution has not changed
because of the addition of GQDs in the precursor solution. Therefore,
the effect of pH has not influenced any changes of the product. Hence,
these results clearly indicate that the size and morphology control
in these experiments is closely related to the incorporation of GQDs
because the concentration of GQDs was the only parameter changed in
the system. The plausible mechanism for the modulation in the morphology
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors
because of the incorporation of GQDs is discussed in the next section.

2.3 Growth Mechanism of GQDs-Incorporated β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ Multiform Morphologies
For the better understanding of the formation processes of multiform
morphologies of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals via incorporation of GQDs during the synthesis,
reaction samples were carefully investigated by taking the different
concentrations of as-prepared GQDs. Here, we believe that GQD particles
of nearly 5 nm serve as the nucleation sites for the nucleation and
further growth of the crystals. Because the precursors used in the
reaction are ionic and GQDs contain functional groups at the edges
and on the surface, lanthanide ions interact with functional group
specially −COOH and −OH groups and form a metal–GQD
complex. Then, nuclei are formed upon the addition of a fluoride source.
Interaction of GQDs with the precursor ions plays an important role,
where the charge or the functional groups such as carboxylic acid,
amine, hydroxyl, etc. present in the GQDs have a significant role
in binding to the lanthanide ions. As the seeds grow, the GQDs bind
to the particular surface of the phosphor seeds, governing the shape
and size of the particles. With an increase in the GQDs concentration,
their probability to bind to the surface increases which increases
the growth of the crystals along the (100) plane, thereby giving rise
to the lowest aspect ratio of the rods. Consequently, with a larger
concentration of GQDs, disklike structures were formed having the
lowest aspect ratio among all. We have formulated the above results
on the same hypothesis as given by Yang et al. for the diethylene
glycol molecule for the growth of KGdF4 nanocrystals.53 Here, GQDs may have different functions—first,
it can form a metal–GQD complex by which the growth rate of
the nanoparticles is slowed down, thereby decreasing the crystallite
size. This is similar to the mechanism reported by Zeng’s group,
where a metal–oleic acid complex was formed, when oleic acid
was used as a ligand for the preparation of NaREF4 nanocrystals.54 Second, this may also slow down the diffusing
rate of the cations and anions which may reduce the collisions’
probability of the ions in the system. Third, it can also cap the
external surfaces of the nanoparticles, giving the nanoparticles a
directional growth. By virtue of this, size control and shape evolution
of the nanoparticles can be easily realized by changing the GQDs’
amount which governs the growth of the crystal in a particular direction.

Further, growth directional analysis was done by measuring the
XRD intensity. In general, facets perpendicular to the fast direction
of growth have smaller surface area; therefore, slow growing face
will dominate the morphology having large surface area and thus will
be more exposed to the environment. Hence, the more exposed plane
will show higher intensity in XRD, which has slower growth. In Figure 6, variation in the
normalized XRD intensity of different planes is plotted with varied
concentration of GQDs used in the system. It can be seen that the
intensity of the plane (100) decreases with higher concentration of
co-functionalized GQDs, suggesting that the plane is less exposed
and growth takes place along this direction, giving rise to disklike
structures at 7 mL of GQDs. Similarly, when compared with other side
planes in hexagonal structures (110) and (101), normalized intensity
decreases, indicating the same. While in the case of the (002) plane
(Figure 6d), the intensity
increases with an increase in the concentration of GQDs, thus implying
that growth direction is perpendicular to this plane.

Figure 6 Variation of normalized
XRD intensity of different planes (a) 100,
(b) 110, (c) 101, and (d) 002 in β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ with the change in concentration of GQDs. Respective
direction of planes is shown in the anisotropic hexagonal crystal
structure.

Thence, it can be concluded that
GQDs have the function of inhibiting
the longitudinal growth along the ⟨0001⟩ direction with
a relative enhancement of the growth along the ⟨10–10⟩
direction in the form of hexagonal prism first and then disklike structures.
Schematic showing the growth direction and proposed mechanism has
been depicted in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively.

Scheme 2 Schematic Illustration of Heterogeneous Nucleation and Growth
Process
and the Effect of GQD Incorporation on the Morphology of Final β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ Phosphors
Here, the GQDs provide nucleation
sites for the heterogeneous nucleation as well as act as a capping
agent and manipulate the growth of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals.

To validate
the influence of the GQDs on the resultant morphology,
we carried out the controlled experiments by changing the dimension
of foreign impurity and the functionality of the as-prepared GQDs.

2.3.1 Effect of Size of the Foreign Particles
Introduced in the Reaction (GO vs CNT)
To study the effect
of size of foreign particles incorporated during the synthesis of
β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals
and to examine whether the change in the morphology of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors is due to the incorporation
of GQDs, a control experiment was performed. In three separate reactions
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors,
GO, MWCNTs and carboxylic- functionalized MWCNTs (COOH-MWCNT) were
incorporated. The synthesis procedure is similar to the preparation
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQDs, except that GO, MWCNTs and COOH-MWCNT were incorporated
instead of GQDs. The as-obtained products were named as β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGO and
β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xMWCNT and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-MWCNT. The composition and phase purity of
the products were examined by XRD as shown in Figure S1 given in the Supporting Information, where the diffraction
peaks of the samples can be indexed to the pure hexagonal phase of
NaYF4 (JCPDS 16-0334). As represented in Figure 7, it was observed that due
to the incorporation of GO sheets and MWCNT, the morphology of the
β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor
crystals remained unchanged. These results infer that the size of
the foreign particles introduced in the reaction plays a role in the
morphology tuning of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors where only small GQD particles can tune the morphology,
whereas large carbon materials: sheet or tubelike structures such
as GO and MWCNT cannot influence and alter the shape of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors.

Figure 7 SEM images show the effect
of different concentrations of GO (a–c),
MWCNT (d–f), and COOH-MWCNT (g–i) on the growth morphology
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors.
We did not observe any change in the morphology of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors because of the
incorporation of these materials as foreign impurities.

2.3.2 Effect of Functionalization
of GQDs on the
β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ Phosphor
Crystal Growth
Furthermore, to analyze the effect of the
functionalization of GQDs on the morphology of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors, we synthesized carboxylic-functionalized
(COOH-GQDs) and amine-functionalized (NH2-GQDs) along with
reduced GQDs (rGQDs). COOH-GQDs, NH2-GQDs, and rGQDs were
characterized by TEM to see the particle size and UV–vis to
see their absorbance. Figure 8 compares the TEM images of COOH-GQDs, NH2-GQDs,
and rGQDs, showing a relatively narrow size distribution (∼3–5
nm). To explore the optical properties, UV–vis spectra were
recorded, showing the main absorbance peak at around 230 nm which
is attributed to the π–π* transitions of sp2 C=C in as-synthesized COOH-GQDs, NH2-GQDs,
and rGQDs, whereas a peak at around ∼300 nm is attributed to
the n−π* transitions of C=O in the case of rGQDs.55

nm. In the case of rGQDs, particles are aggregated because of the
less surface charge after the reduction reaction. Their respective
UV–visible absorbance spectra are also shown below, showing
the main absorbance peak at around 230 nm in as-synthesized COOH-GQDs,
NH2-GQDs, and rGQDs, whereas a peak was observed at around
∼300 nm in rGQD alone.

The measured zeta potentials of COOH-GQDs, NH2-GQDs,
and rGQDs were −32.8, −15.8, and −20.5 mV, respectively.
The positive shift of the zeta potential for the NH2-GQDs
and rGQDs indirectly indicates the introduction of amine groups because
the introduced amine groups can counteract part of the electronegative
effect and reduction in hydroxyl groups, respectively.56 The concentration of the functionalized GQDs
was calculated from the TGA at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under
nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S2), which
was found to be 10 mg/mL for all the types of GQDs. Furthermore, we
performed the synthesis of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ by incorporating COOH-GQDs and NH2-GQDs
in the reaction vessel. The phase purity and crystallinity of the
as-prepared samples were monitored by XRD and compared in Figure S3A, where the diffraction peaks matched
very well with the standard JCPDS data of β-NaYF4. No traces of impurity peaks were observed, indicating that all
the samples crystallized in a single phase of β-NaYF4. It can be seen in Figure 9 that functionalization has a notable effect on the morphology
and size of the resultant products. Microrods with cracked ends were
formed using COOH-GQDs having an average length of ∼15 μm
at x = 5 mL, whereas the average size of the microrods
increased to ∼30 μm when the concentration of COOH-GQDs
increased further to 7 mL. In a study in 2006, during the growth of
NaYF4 crystals, oleic acid selectively bound to the surface
which was parallel to the c-axis, rendering the growth
along the (001) direction and hence resulting in the formation of
nanorods.57 Supporting the above mechanism,
in another study, it was concluded that the anionic form of oleic
acid (OA–) preferentially binds to the RE3+ ions exposed more on the six symmetric facets of the hexagonal fluoride
crystal, resulting in the formation of rods.19 Applying the same hypothesis, we can conclude that the functional
groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl may bind to the side planes
of the hexagonal prismatic structures where lanthanide ions are more
exposed, giving rise to the formation of microrods; therefore, the
preferential growth direction is along ⟨0001⟩. Additionally,
growth direction was confirmed by normalized XRD intensity. As shown
in Figure 10a, the
intensity of different planes in β-NaYF4 changes
when we increase the concentration of COOH-GQDs. The increment in
the intensity of the (100), (110), and (101) planes suggested that
the growth direction was perpendicular to these planes, thus rendering
the growth along the (001) plane. Further, we have studied the effect
of NH2-GQDs on the growth process of β-NaYF4. The crystallinity of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xNH2-GQDs was examined
by XRD. The diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern shown in Figure S3B can be indexed to pure β-NaYF4.

GQDs was varied from x = 1 mL, x = 3 mL, and x = 7 mL. Microrods were formed when
COOH-GQDs were incorporated, while there was no change observed in
the case of the incorporation of NH2-GQDs during the synthesis
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+.

Figure 10 Variation of normalized XRD intensity
of different planes in β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ with the change in the concentration
of (a) COOH-GQDs and (b) NH2-GQDs.

The presence of NH2-GQDs has no obvious impact
on the
morphology of the crystals, which can be seen in the FESEM images
(Figure 9d–f).
Moreover, the XRD intensity of different planes as shown in Figure 10b has not changed
with the concentration of NH2-GQDs, confirming the unaltered
morphology of β-NaYF4.

To study the effect
of non-functionalized GQDs, we have used rGQDs
during the synthesis of NaYF4. Oxygen-rich functional groups
such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, and epoxy groups are introduced to the
edges and onto the basal plane during the top-down synthesis,58,59 which can be reduced using some of the reducing agents such as NaBH4, hydrazine hydrate, and so forth. Here, we have reduced COOH-GQDs
with NaBH4 which reduces hydroxyl and epoxy groups on the
basal plane of the GQDs while carboxyl moieties remain unreduced at
the edges. As observed in the XRD pattern shown in Figure S3C, some of the diffraction peaks belong to the cubic
phase of NaYF4 which matched very well with the standard
face-centered cubic structure data (JCPDS 77-2042), whereas other
peaks can be indexed to the pure hexagonal phase of NaYF4 (JCPDS 16-0334). We can see in Figure 11 that similar microrods were formed when
we performed the reaction with rGQDs having few carboxylic acid groups
at the edges. Here, the proposed mechanism for the formation of microrods
may be the same as that in the case of COOH-GQDs. Apart from microrods,
small spherical particles were seen, which have been assigned as the
cubic phase as indexed in the XRD pattern. Careful investigation revealed
that the microrods were composed of solid interiors with small quasi-spheres
attached to them. Together with the XRD pattern, it can be judged
from SEM images that the microrods were hexagonal phase and small
quasi-spherical nanoparticles were cubic. Although the formation of
cubic phase in the system is unclear at present, we can provide the
following explanation for the existence of cubic phase. Because the
rGQDs contain less number of functional groups, it would lead to the
availability of more number of lanthanide ions, which would provide
fast nucleation and growth of NaYF4 crystals. However,
there were no enough monomers to supply the growth of small particles
under the same circumstances. Thus, small nanoparticles with cubic
phase as well as microrods with hexagonal phase coexisted in the final
products with rGQDs. The schematic and table showing corresponding
morphologies obtained at different concentrations of GQDs, different
functionalized GQDs, and different foreign impurities are represented
in Scheme 3, and details
of aspect ratios are summarized in Table 1.

2.4 PL Studies
Owing
to the non-existence
of d-electrons in Y3+ ([Kr] 4d0) in undoped
NaYF4, the probability of emission is negligible in the
host matrix. Figure 12 compares the PL emission spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD (x = 1, 3,
5, and 7 mL) phosphor crystals. The luminescence of lanthanide ions
mainly originates from the electron transition within 4f electronic
configuration [Xe 4fN; N = 0–14], which consists of complex energy levels because
of Coulombic repulsion and spin–orbit coupling. The shielding
of the 4f electrons of Ln3+ by the filled 5s2 and 5p6 subshells results in weak influence of external
environment, which is responsible for their sharp and narrow emission
spectra. Thus, the emissive electronic transitions are a characteristic
feature of lanthanide dopant ions, and so, the incorporation of GQDs
does not render any peak shift in the transition emission of Tb3+ ions and bands differ only in their relative intensities.
Here, Gd3+ ion is used as a sensitizer to enhance the luminescence
of Tb3+ ions. As Gd3+ ions exhibit strong absorption
band at 273 nm because of its 8S7/2 → 6I11/2 transition, Gd3+ and Ln3+ together containing nanoparticles exhibit a very intense Ln3+ excitation band at 273 nm because of the 8S7/2 → 6IJ transition in Gd3+ ions followed by a nonradiative (nr) energy transfer to
Ln3+ ions.60,61 Thus, Gd3+ ions act
as a sensitizer to enhance the emission of Tb3+ ion via
nr energy transfer. The obtained emission spectra monitored at λex = 273 nm yielded intense green emissions in the region of
480–680 nm, which are due to the 5D4 → 7FJ (J = 3, 4,
5, 6) transitions of Tb3+ ions. Four prominent emission
peaks centered at ∼488, ∼544, ∼584, and ∼619
nm originate from the transitions of 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 7F4, and 5D4 → 7F3, respectively.22,62,63 The mechanism for DC in Gd3+–Tb3+ pair
under excitation of 273 nm has been demonstrated in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Among these transitions,
the green emission 5D4 → 7F5 at ∼544 nm is the most intense emission, which
corresponds to a magnetic dipole transition. Figure 12 shows the comparative emission spectra
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors
incorporated with different concentrations of GQDs. It can be seen
that with the increasing concentration of GQDs, the PL intensity of
the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors
showed a remarkable enhancement. We believe that the change or increase
in luminescence intensity is due to change in morphology and size
of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD crystals. Different morphologies of the host matrix
greatly influence the emission intensity and the shape of the spectra.63,64 It is evident from the spectra that among all the samples, the disklike
structure obtained from β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQDs (x = 7) displayed
the strongest emission intensity under similar measurement conditions
shown in Figure 12. The β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD (x = 0) rods possess the lowest emission
intensity. Whereas the relative luminescence intensity of other β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD crystals,
that is, hexagonal microprisms obtained at x = 1
and x = 3 and flower-shaped crystals obtained at x = 5, lies in between the rods and the disklike structure.
The reason behind the difference in relative PL intensity might be
due to the difference in the surface area of different facets, defects,
and crystallinities. Herein, the highest luminescence intensity of
disklike structures might be due to their low surface area to volume
ratio and consequently possesses low surface defects when compared
to that of other anisotropic structures.65,66 While the rods and other as-formed morphologies are predicted to
have more surface defects owing to their high surface area.67 The defects may act as the nonradiative recombination
centers, which are thus responsible for luminescence quenching. Moreover,
high surface area also renders greater Gd3+ or Tb3+ ion fraction on the particle surface, which again causes the enhanced
nonradiative quenching and results in diminished emission intensity.66,68 In addition, to further understand the variation in PL performance,
the PL spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGO, β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xMWCNT, and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-MWCNT (x = 7) crystals were also studied. Figure 13 shows the comparative PL spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQDs (x = 0 and 7), β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGO, β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xMWCNT, and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-MWCNT (x = 7) crystals. As discussed in section 2.3.1, the incorporation of other carbon materials
such as GO and MWCNTs had a very little influence on the morphology
and size of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals. As a consequence with negligible change in the morphologies,
it can be clearly seen that the relative luminescence intensities
hardly changed with the incorporation of the above-mentioned foreign
impurities. However, when compared with that of the disklike structures,
the PL intensity showed a remarkable change. The luminescence intensity
of a disklike structure was observed to be eight times stronger than
that of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals incorporated with GO and MWCNT and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ rods. To get further insights into
the effect of the incorporation of GQDs on the luminescence intensity
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor
crystals, the PL spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals incorporated with different functionalized
GQDs, β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-GQDs, and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xNH2-GQDs were demonstrated
(Figure 14). As it
is already discussed above that functionalization of GQDs plays an
important role in the morphology tuning of the crystals, it could
be clearly reflected in the PL spectra. In the case of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-GQD
(x = 1, 3, and 7) crystals, with increasing concentration
of COOH-GQDs, the size of as-formed microrods increased and thus the
PL intensity also increased. Because the surface area to volume ratio
increases with decrease in the size of the material, a phosphor with
the largest size would possess the lowest surface area and the highest
luminescence intensity.69 Therefore, the
β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-GQD (x = 7) microrod (∼30 μm)
possesses the highest luminescence intensity, while β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-GQD
(x = 1) microrods (∼15 μm) and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ rods have a lower PL intensity.

with the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors
incorporated with GQDs.

Figure 14 Comparative static PL emission spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors with different concentrations
of COOH-GQDS, NH2-GQDs, rGQDs, and β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD phosphors
at λex = 273 nm where x is varied
as x = 1 mL, x = 3 mL, and x = 7 mL.

Negligible change in
the PL intensity was observed owing to negligible
change in size and morphology of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xNH2-GQD (x = 1, 3, and 7) rod-shaped crystals (Figure 14). PL spectra of NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ with rGQDs were also recorded and compared
with those of disklike structures. The emission intensity of NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xrGQDs was
obviously lower than that of disklike structures but higher than that
of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-GQD microrods. Because NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xrGQDs attained cubic phase along
with the hexagonal phase, that is, mixed phase, their emission intensity
is expected to be lower because the mixed phase system is less luminescent
than the pure hexagonal phase.25,70,71

However, the higher intensity of NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xrGQD microrods as compared with
that of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xCOOH-GQD microrods was due to their larger size (∼35
μm). However, the overall spectra revealed that the PL intensity
of disklike structures remained the strongest emission intensity among
all the samples. The luminescent properties of inorganic materials
are dependent on several factors such as crystal structure around
emitting ions, morphology, size, crystallinity, impurity doping, surface
defects, surface adsorbed species, solvent molecules, ligands, and
so forth.72 In this study, although incorporation
of GQDs had significant influence on the growth of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystals, but on the basis
of the above analysis, among all the factors we reasonably believe
that the variation in PL properties of the samples predominantly arises
from their size and morphologies.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel impurity-driven strategy for the morphology
tuning of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals is presented, wherein GQDs were incorporated in
situ into the β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ crystal system to manipulate the growth of phosphor crystals. Consequently,
the morphology of the crystals was drastically changed upon the incorporation
of GQDs at different concentrations. The results were also compared
with differently functionalized GQDs at varied concentrations. The
plausible growth mechanism of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+-xGQD crystals is proposed. The
effect of two-dimensional and one-dimensional other carbon-based structures
such as GO and MWCNT was investigated and compared with the results
obtained with the incorporation of GQDs. It was found that the PL
properties of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals are strongly dependent on the crystallite size
and morphology. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time,
we have implied an approach to incorporate GQDs as an impurity to
influence the growth of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphor crystals to attain their multiform morphologies.
The results presented here underline the important role that controlled
morphological synthesis can play in optimizing the key properties
of advanced functional materials and could be extended to other lanthanide-doped
nanocrystals. This unique approach paves way to new opportunities
for designing and tuning the rare earth phosphor crystals and their
unique luminescence properties may render potential applications in
the field of color displays, light-emitting diodes, solid-state lasers,
and luminescent biological labels.

nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.89%), gadolinium nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.89%), and terbium nitrate hexahydrate
(Tb(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.89%) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.9%) and
potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 99.0%) were received from
Thomas Baker. Ammonium fluoride (NH4F, >95%) and sodium
nitrate (NaNO3, >99%) were received from Merck. The
graphite
powder was obtained from Loba Chemie. PEI (with Mw = 25 000 and Mn =
10 000), MWCNT, and COOH-MWCNT were received from Sigma-Aldrich
Inc. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Synthesis of GO
GO was prepared
by using the modified Hummers method from the graphite powder.73 Briefly, graphite powder (2 g) and sodium nitrate
(1 g) were added to a 250 mL round-bottom flask at 0 °C. Then,
50 mL of concentrated H2SO4 was added slowly
with stirring below 5 °C. The solution was then stirred for 30
min. KMnO4 (0.3 g) was then added to the solution below
10 °C. The solution was again stirred for 30 min. Then KMnO4 (7 g) was added over 1 h below 20 °C. After this, the
solution was warmed to 35 ± 3 °C and was stirred for 2 h.
Water (90 mL) was then slowly dripped into the paste, causing an increase
in temperature to 70 °C. This diluted suspension was stirred
at this temperature for 15 min. The mixture was treated with 10 mL
of H2O2 (30%) and 55 mL of water to quench the
reaction. The suspension turned bright yellow, and subsequently, the
solution was filtered, resulting in light brown precipitate. The precipitate
was then washed with warm solution of 3% HCl (150 mL). It was dried
at 40 °C for 24 h in vacuum. The GO stock solution was obtained
with a concentration of 4 mg/mL.

4.2.2 Synthesis
of GQDs
4.2.2.1 Synthesis of Carboxylic and Amine Co-Functionalized
GQDs (GQDs)
We synthesized GQDs using the previously reported
method elsewhere.56 To the above prepared
stock solution of GO (15 mL), 40 mL of H2O2 (30%)
and 10 mL of ammonia (25–28%) were added. This mixture was
reacted at 80 °C for 24 h with vigorous stirring. The solution
was evaporated at 65 °C to remove unreacted H2O2, ammonia, and water. Finally, ethanol was used to precipitate
and wash the final GQD product. The GQDs obtained by this method had
both the functional groups such as carboxylic and amine and were highly
stable and dispersible in water.

4.2.2.2 Synthesis
of COOH-GQDs
To the
prepared GO stock solution (15 mL), 40 mL of H2O2 (30%) was added. This mixture was reacted at 80 °C for 24 h
with vigorous stirring. The solution was evaporated at 65 °C
to remove unreacted H2O2 and water. Finally,
ethanol was used to precipitate and wash the final COOH-GQDs.

4.2.2.3 Synthesis of NH2-GQDs
NH2-GQDs
were prepared using the hydrothermal method reported
elsewhere.74 For NH2-GQDs, 15
mL of GO stock solution, 15 mL of DI water, and 10 mL of ammonia were
added together. The mixture was stirred for 30 min, followed by ultrasonication
for another 30 min. The resultant solution was transferred into a
50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 6 h by
hydrothermal treatment. Next, the solution was cooled down to the
room temperature, and NH2-GQDs were filtered through a
0.22 μm microporous membrane. The filtered solution was heated
at 100 °C for another 1 h to remove excess ammonia in the mixture.
The obtained solution was stored for further characterization.

4.2.2.4 Synthesis of rGQDs
COOH-GQDs
were reduced by using sodium borohydride, following a previously reported
method.55 Briefly, to the above-prepared
(section 2.2.2.2) COOH-GQDs (15 mL), 1 g of NaBH4 was added.
The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h. When
the color of the mixture changed from faded to light yellow, HNO3 was added to terminate the reaction. Finally, pH was tuned
to 8. The resultant solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm
microporous membrane and stored for further characterization.

4.2.3 Synthesis of Amine-Functionalized β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+
In a typical procedure60,75 for the synthesis of β-NaYF4:15%Gd3+/5%Tb3+, solutions of Y(NO3)3, Gd(NO3)3 and Tb(NO3)3 (0.2 M) were
added in a 10 mL solution of NaCl (0.2 M). The solution was continuously
stirred for 30–40 min. Then 20 mL of ethanol was added, followed
by the addition of PEI (5 wt %). Then, 0.5 M of NH4F was
added dropwise to the resultant solution. The whole mixture was stirred
for 30 min. Finally, the mixture was poured in a Teflon container
with 80 mL capacity, and the reaction was set for 24 h hydrothermally
at 180 °C.

4.2.4 Synthesis of β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ Incorporated with GQDs
A similar
procedure was followed to synthesize GQDs incorporated β-NaYF4:Gd3+/Tb3+ phosphors except that different
concentrations of the as-prepared xGQDs (x = 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 mL) were incorporated in situ in the
initial solution reaction system.

4.3 Characterization
Techniques
The phase
purity and crystallinity of the as-prepared samples were characterized
by powder XRD using a PANalytical X’PERT PRO instrument and
the iron-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) in
the 2θ range of 10°–80° with a step size of
0.02°. To analyze the shape and size of the samples, FESEM (FESEM:
Hitachi S-4200) was used. The specific structural details and morphology
were obtained by using a FEI Tecnai T20 transmission electron microscope
operated at 200 keV accelerating voltage with Schottky field emitter
source with maximum beam current (>100 nA) and small energy spread
(0.8 eV or less). The powder samples obtained were dispersed in ethanol
and then drop-casted on carbon-coated copper TEM grids with 200 mesh
and loaded to a single tilt sample holder. UV–vis spectroscopy
measurements were performed on a Jasco UV–vis–NIR (model
V570) dual beam spectrometer operated at a resolution of 2 nm. PL
spectra were acquired using a Cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer,
equipped with a 400 W Xe lamp as an excitation source and a Hamamatsu
R928 photomultiplier tube as a detector. Raman spectra were recorded
on an HR-800 Raman spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon-HORIBA, France) using
monochromatic radiation emitted by a He–Ne laser (633 nm),
operating at 20 mW and with the accuracy of ±1 cm–1 in the range between 450 and 850 nm, equipped with thermoelectrically
cooled (with Peltier junctions), multichannel, spectroscopic grade
CCD detector (1024 × 256 pixels of 26 μm) with dark current
lower than 0.002 electrons pixel–1 s–1. An objective of 50 XLD magnification was used to both focus and
collect the signal from the powder sample dispersed on a glass slide.
TGA was done using the SDT model Q600 of TA Instruments Inc. USA at
a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen flow at 100 mL/min.
A PALS Zeta Potential Analyzer Ver 3.54 (Brookhaven Instrument Corps.)
was used to determine the electrophoretic mobilities. Mobilities were
converted to zeta potentials (ζ) using the Smoluchowski model.
DI water was used as the dispersion medium.
