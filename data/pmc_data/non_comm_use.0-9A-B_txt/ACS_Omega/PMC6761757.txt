Malaria remains a
major detrimental parasitic disease in the developing
world, with more than 200 million cases annually. Widespread drug-resistant
parasite strains push for the development of novel antimalarial drugs.
Plant-derived natural products are key sources of antimalarial molecules. Euterpe oleracea Martius (“açaí”)
originates from Brazil and has anti-inflammatory and antineoplasic
properties. Here, we evaluated the antimalarial efficacy of three
phenolic fractions of açaí; total phenolics (1), nonanthocyanin phenolics (2), and total anthocyanins
(3). In vitro, fraction 2 moderately inhibited
parasite growth in chloroquine-sensitive (HB3) and multiresistant
(Dd2) Plasmodium falciparum strains,
while none of the fractions was toxic to noncancer cells. Despite
the limited activity in vitro, the oral treatment with 20 mg/kg of
fraction 1 reduced parasitemia by 89.4% in Plasmodium chabaudi-infected mice and prolonged survival.
Contrasting in vitro and in vivo activities of 1 suggest
key antiplasmodial roles for polyphenol metabolites rather than the
fraction itself. Finally, we performed haploinsufficiency chemical
genomic profiling (HIP) utilizing heterozygous Saccharomyces
cerevisiae deletion mutants to identify molecular
mechanisms of açaí fractions. HIP results indicate
proteostasis as the main cellular pathway affected by fraction 2. These results open avenues to develop açaí
polyphenols as potential new antimalarial candidates.

Introduction
Caused by protozoa
of the genus Plasmodium and
transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, malaria is historically
one of the major parasitic diseases to affect human populations. World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 200 million cases
of the disease and around 400 000 malaria-related deaths occurred
in 2017.1 Efforts toward malaria elimination
have been successful by using insecticide-treated nets in endemic
regions, the development of rapid diagnostic tests, and the adoption
of artemisinin-based combined therapies (ACTs). Despite the decreased
number of malaria cases by 40% within the last decade, the incidence
has significantly increased in the Americas between 2016 and 2017,1 keeping the long-term goal of eradication still
unreachable.

One of the major drawbacks in malaria control is
the development
of parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs. Parasite resistance
has been reported for all known classes of antimalarial drugs.2 Recently, Southeast Asia has recorded lower parasite
susceptibility to ACTs, the front-line treatment indicated for severe
cases of Plasmodium falciparum infection.3 Facing the imminent spread of ACT-resistant parasites,
there is a renewed need for new compounds with antiplasmodial activity.

Natural extracts have played a major role in the discovery of antimalarial
compounds, as antimalarial drugs such as quinine and artemisinin are
derived from plants widely used in the traditional medicine.4,5 Biodiversity-rich regions like the Amazon are valuable sources of
plants with potential antimalarial activity. Among Brazilian Amazon
plants, açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) is both one of the most consumed fruits and one of the major
export products from the region,6 illustrating
the cultural and economic importance of ethnobotanical-based approaches
for natural compounds prospection. The use of açaí
by local communities to treat malaria-related symptoms such as fever
has been described.7 Açaí
is known by its functional properties, mainly due to its polyphenolic
composition, associated with antineoplasic activity and prevention
of cardiovascular diseases.8,9

One of the main
hurdles of working with natural products is the
challenge of characterizing their components and respective modes
of action. In this context, chemical genomic profiling of natural
extracts aims to explore functional relationships between eukaryotic
genes and bioactive compounds in response to pharmacological perturbation
by quantification of yeast growth fitness in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with a gene copy
deleted.10

Preliminary studies have
shown that açaí roots
did not present in vitro antimalarial activity.11 However, the present study evaluated the antimalarial activity
of polyphenolic açaí pulp fractions in vitro against
CQ-sensitive and -resistant P. falciparum strains, besides in vivo antimalarial activity on P. chabaudi-infected mice. Finally, the mode of action
of açaí polyphenols was investigated through yeast-based
chemogenomics.

Results and Discussion
Chemical Characterization
of Açaí Fractions
Three polyphenol-rich
fractions were obtained from açaí
pulp fractionation: total phenolics (1), nonanthocyanin
phenolics (2), and total anthocyanins (3). Two major anthocyanins were identified in 1 and 3 in high relative abundance (Table 1). Cyanidin-3-rutinoside represented 62.7
and 69.3% of 1 and 3, respectively, while
cyanidin-3-glucoside accounted for 14.9 and 15.0% of these two fractions.
Compound 2 presented high relative abundance of phenolic
acids with 36.9% of protocatechuic acid. Moreover, polyphenolic C-glycosides were also found in high proportions, as orientin
and isoorientin represented 26.6 and 23.4% of its composition, respectively.
The total phenolic concentration of each extract, quantified by Folin–Ciocalteu,
was 26 932 ± 865 mg/L (1), 1343 ± 154
mg/L (2), and 17 820 ± 570 mg/L (3) gallic acid equivalent (GAE).

The polyphenol
composition of the açaí fractions
used in this investigation is clearly diverse, while the anthocyanins
cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside were the most abundant
polyphenols identified in both 1 and 3;
these were not identified in 2. The major nonanthocyanin
polyphenols found include protocatechuic acid, orientin, and isoorientin,
considered flavonol-C-glucosides. These three compounds
together account for about 85% of 2 composition, while
in 1 and 3 fractions they represent less
than 20%. These compounds are not highly bioavailable but are found
as parental compounds in the blood stream,12 which could significantly contribute to their role in the antimalarial
activity of fractions.

In Vitro Antimalarial Activity of Açaí
Fractions
In vitro antimalarial activity was assessed using
a PicoGreen-based
fluorometric assay in P. falciparum cultures. The activity of 1, 2, and 3 in chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant P.
falciparum strains is described as relative DNA content
compared to untreated controls (Figure 1). Chloroquine was used at 30 nM as a positive control
for HB3 (CQ-sensitive) strain and Artesunate also at 30 nM for Dd2
(CQ-resistant) strain. When tested from 1.0 to 20.0 mg/L GAE, none
of the concentrations applied for 1 and 3 reduced DNA content, i.e., inhibited parasite growth, for either
of the parasite strains assayed. Fraction 2, on the other
hand, showed moderate antiplasmodial activity on both strains. Starting
at 10.0 mg/L GAE of 2, the relative DNA content of HB3
strain was 76.5% of untreated control, while that of Dd2 strain was
65.1%, both showing statistically significant growth inhibition. At
20.0 mg/L GAE, relative DNA content of HB3 strain was 65.8% of untreated
control, while that of Dd2 strain was 61.7%. Interestingly, contrary
to our findings, it has been shown that antimalarial activity and
total amount of anthocyanins are directly correlated.13 Hence, we hypothesize that within açaí
fractions, another class of compounds might be responsible for antimalarial
activity.

(Dd2) P. falciparum strains treated
with açaí (A) total phenolics (1),
(B) total anthocyanins (3), and (C) nonanthocyanin phenolics
(2) for 48 h. Chloroquine 100 nM was used as antimalarial
positive control for HB3 strain and Artesunate 70 nM for Dd2 strain.
Each concentration tested was compared to its respective strain control
(*p < 0.05, ANOVA-Dunnett).

Low proportion of 2 within 1 and 3 may explain the lack of antimalarial activity for the latter
two fractions. Fraction 2 is composed of approximately
25% of isoorientin that has already been shown to present antimalarial
activity in vitro in Ajuga laxmannii plant extracts.14 Also, protocatechuic
acid, which accounts for approximately 37% of 2 composition,
has been shown to have moderate antimalarial activity.15 Other plant-based extracts have been described
as possessing in vitro antimalarial activity,16−18 including popular
Amazonian plants such as guaraná (Paullinia
cupana) and cajueiro (Anacardium occidentale).19

Cytotoxicity Assessment
of Açaí Fraction
The cytotoxicities of 1, 2, and 3 were evaluated using
the resazurin dye assay to quantify
their effects on the proliferation of a murine macrophage cell line.
Concentration range used for cytotoxicity assay was the same as that
used for evaluation of antimalarial activity in vitro, up to 20.0
mg/L GAE. The 1, 2, and 3 fractions
did not negatively influence viability of RAW264.7 cells (Figure 2). As our group has
described the absence of cytotoxicity in nonmalignant colon myofibroblast
cells by açaí compounds previously,20 there is validation on the safety of açaí
polyphenols for distinct cell lines.

Figure 2 Cell viability of RAW264.7 cells treated
with açaí
fractions. Murine macrophage cells were treated with (A) total phenolics,
(B) total anthocyanins, and (C) nonanthocyanin phenolics for 24 h.
No statistical differences were found between treatments and the control
group (p > 0.05, ANOVA-Dunnett).

Evaluation of the in Vivo Antimalarial Activity of E. oleracea M
A murine model of infection
was used to investigate whether açaí polyphenols could
mitigate parasitemia in vivo. P. chabaudi-infected mice were treated orally with 1 (10, 15, and
20 mg/kg) on day 0 to day 12 post-infection. Results indicate that
the treatment reduced parasitemia in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 3A). During parasitemia
peak (days 6 and 7), 20 mg/kg of 1 decreased parasite
growth by 89.4 and 77.3% (Table 2), respectively, compared to the untreated control
group (Figure 3B).
Similarly, 15 mg/kg of 1 also diminished parasite burden
and reduced parasitemia by 81 and 62.2% on days 6 and 7 p.i, respectively.
Animals treated with 10 mg/kg of 1 also showed a significant
parasitemia inhibition of 54.2% on day 6 p.i. Additionally, doses
of 20 and 15 mg/kg of 1 allowed 100% of animal survival
until day 15 p.i., in contrast to no survival observed for the untreated
group. However, when treated with 10 mg/kg, 70% of the animals did
not survive until day 9 p.i. due to infection (Figure 3D).

In
vivo antimalarial activity observed may be due to a few determinants:
the presence of polyphenolic C-glycosides in 2, the activity of the microbiome in metabolizing açaí
polyphenols, and the hepatic (postabsorption) metabolization. Most
notably, better in vivo antimalarial results compared to in vitro
ones for 1 suggests a role for compound metabolites rather
than the compounds themselves.

We used 1 as an
oral treatment to mice to represent
a whole-fruit approach that is prevalent in malaria-endemic areas.
In humans, clinical research has shown that the polyphenols in açaí
are bioavailable29 and improve redox metabolism
and oxidative status,30 besides retaining
antioxidant and antigenotoxic activities even after digestion and
gut microbiota fermentation.31

Yeast-Based
Chemical Genomic Profiling
One of the main
challenges of working with bioactive natural extracts is to identify
their potential molecular targets. Therefore, seeking to characterize
the antimalarial mechanism of açaí fractions, we assessed
drug-induced hypersensitivity in a budding yeast collection of heterozygous
deletion mutant strains, which has been shown to be a suitable approach
for exploring the mode of action of crude extracts.21 To outline specific 1 and 2 signatures,
both treatments were assayed due to their different patterns of Plasmodium inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

We identified
51 heterozygous yeast mutants depleted among the yeast collection
treated with 1 (Figure 4A) and 67 mutants depleted in population treated with 2 (Figure 4C). The data set describing the sensitive mutants identified in our
screens (p < 0.01) include information about their
degree of differential growth (Supporting Information File 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first yeast-based chemical genomic profiling describing E. oleracea M.

yeast strains treated
with different açaí fractions. (A) Heterozygous
yeast strains most depleted when treated with IC20 of 1. Differential growth (log 2 fold change) is plotted
on the y-axis as a function of yeast strains organized

the strains most susceptible to the treatment. The dots in red represent
ORFs that fall within the cutoffs p-value <0.001
and log 2 fold change <0. (B) Biological processes identified

To identify enrichment in biological processes or functions within
the strains negatively selected following treatment, we used the Gene
Ontology (GO) tool “Go Term Finder”. However, no statistically
significant functional enrichment was observed for neither 1 nor 2 based on this tool. In the absence of a tool
that analyzes and connects gene ontology pathways in Plasmodium, data were analyzed using the Reactome tool, which describes the
possible reactions occurring in a human cell when proteins used as
input are present and active simultaneously. Hence, based on eukaryotic
conservation of molecular functions, functional annotation of terms
yielded by Reactome is taken from the roles of homologous proteins,
i.e., human counterparts of yeast genes found to be depleted in the
assay. For 1, control of cell cycle progression, DNA
replication, and mRNA processing account for 10 of the 13 biological
processes enriched (p < 0.05) among pathway hits
(Figure 4B). The one
strain heterozygous for an essential gene under 1 treatment
was Δarb1/ARB1, involved in
ribosome biogenesis and assembly.22 For 2, among the biological processes enriched based on the Reactome
tool (p < 0.05), unfolded protein response and
CCT/TRiC functions are responsible for 8 of the 16 processes identified
(Figure 4D). Interestingly,
mutants deleted for essential genes involved in proteostasis such
as CCT2 and CCT523 and UBA2, related to protein sumoylation,24 were hypersensitive to 2 treatment.
Considering the low proportion of 2 within the fraction 1, we confirmed distinct modes of action for the treatments.

As we believe that polyphenolic C-glycosides in 2 may be responsible for the antimalarial activity observed
for 1 in vivo, we further investigated molecular mechanisms
of 2. The cellular pathways most affected by fraction 2 relate to the CCT complex or TriC, which is an essential
protein folding machinery involved in protein homeostasis that helps
folding nascent polypeptides into biologically functional structures,25 regulating cellular response to proteotoxic
stress.26 Hence, CCT plays a key role in
proteostasis and cell survival and is highly conserved among eukaryotes.27 All CCT subunits have been identified in Plasmodium genome,28 and the
complex is likely to play a critical role in parasite biology as the
knockdown of one subunit leads to impaired growth in parasite asexual
stages.29 CCT is also implicated in the
export of PfEMP1, the most virulent factor of severe malaria.30 Moreover, transcriptomic analysis of P. falciparum isolates has linked increased levels
of mRNAs for CCT/TriC to delayed parasite clearance upon artemisinin
treatment.31 This finding suggests that 2 could present bioactive elements targeting protein homeostasis
in a similar way to artemisinin, one of the most important antimalarial
drugs in the clinic.

Two other elements listed among the pathways
affected by treatment
with 2 are Prefoldin and SUMO, both strongly correlated
with proteostasis maintenance. Prefoldin is a cochaperonin that interacts
with CCT, helping it to coordinate protein folding.32 SUMO, or small ubiquitin-like modifiers, is an essential
family of proteins highly conserved among eukaryotes and known as
competitive inhibitors of ubiquitin.33 Altogether,
data indicate that 2 is likely to affect protein homeostasis
in Plasmodium. Additionally, two strains mutant for
genes from the glutaredoxin family (Grxs), GRX1 and GRX4, were hypersensitive to 2. Grx1 catalyzes
reduction of disulfide bonds in response to oxidative stress, protecting
cells against oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species
via GSH metabolism.34 However, grx1 null mutants are more resistant to some oxidative stress
agents, whereas grx4 mutants are hypersensitive to
oxidative stress.35,36 Our findings reveal the action
of 2 in disturbing the delicate redox balance of target
cells, which require Grx proteins to be reestablished. Taken together,
yeast genome-wide profiling of a potential molecular mechanism of 2 suggests that essential protein homeostasis and antioxidant
pathways conserved in Plasmodium represent potential
targets.

Collectively, the data presented here demonstrate the
antimalarial
potential of açaí pulp fractions in vitro and
in vivo and indicate that 2 may account for this activity
against the parasite by affecting proteostasis as major molecular
target. Our findings indicate the potential to use açaí
polyphenols as novel antimalarial compounds.

Experimental
Section
Açaí Polyphenolic Extraction, Fractionation,
and Chemical Analyses
Polyphenol-rich açaí
fractions were obtained from clarified fruit pulp dried into a powder
provided by Yakima Fruit Works (Moxee, WA) and Indústria de
Produtos Alimenticios Café Campinho Ltda (Alfenas, MG, Brazil).
Powdered açaí pulp was dissolved in distilled
water and vacuum-filtered, followed by fractionation process, as previously
described.37 Briefly, two activated C18 Sep-Pak 6cc cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA)
were used to remove soluble solids such as sugars and acids and adsorb
targeted polyphenolics. The first cartridge for total phenolics (1) was eluted with 100% methanol acidified with 0.1% formic
acid. The second cartridge separated nonanthocyanin phenolics (2) by first eluting with 100% ethyl acetate followed by total
anthocyanins (3) with 100% methanol acidified with 0.1%
formic acid. Solvents were evaporated to dryness, and fractions redissolved
in formic acid buffer (pH 3.5). All fractions were stored at −20
°C. Total phenolic quantification was performed using the Folin–Ciocalteu
assay and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAEs).38 Fraction composition was determined as previously
published37 by reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry using a Thermo
Finnigan LCQ Dexa XP Max MSn ion trap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with an ESI ion
source.

Cultivation of P. falciparum-Infected
Erythrocytes
Chloroquine-sensitive (HB3) and multidrug resistant
(Dd2) strains of P. falciparum were
cultured in erythrocytes from O+ healthy local donors.
The culture media consisted of RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Waltham, MA) supplemented
with 5% (w/v) AlbuMAX (Gibco, Waltham, MA), 25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 100 μM hypoxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), and 25 mM NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO). P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes
were cultured at 2% hematocrit and incubated at modified atmosphere
(5% CO2, 5% O2, 90% N2) and 37 °C,
as previously described.39

In Vitro Antimalarial
Activity by PicoGreen-Based Assay
A DNA-based fluorometric
assay was used to assess the in vitro antimalarial
activity of açaí pulp fractions in P. falciparum, as previously described.40,41 Parasites were synchronized with sorbitol and incubated with 1.0–20.0
mg/L GAE of fractions 1, 2, or 3 in 96-well plates at 2% hematocrit and 1% parasitemia. Negative
(untreated) and positive controls (chloroquine or artesunate, IC50) were included. Incubation followed for 48 h in a candle
jar at 37 °C. Inhibition of parasite growth was measured using
a plate reader (BMG Labtech, Durhan, NC) at 485/520 nm (excitation/emission).
Experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxicity of açaí
fractions was assessed by a resazurin-based assay in murine macrophage
cells (RAW264.7). Cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured at 5% CO2 and 37 °C
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, ATCC, Manassas,
VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Waltham,
MA) and 1% (v/v) antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin, Gibco,
Waltham, MA). Cells (104/well) were seeded into 96-well
plates and exposed to 5.0–20.0 mg/L GAE of fractions 1, 2, or 3 for 24 h. Untreated wells
were also included. After incubation, resazurin (TOX8, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) was added. The fluorescence intensity was determined
using a microplate reader (BMG Labtech Inc, Durhan, NC) at 560/590
nm (excitation/emission). Cell viability was calculated relative to
the untreated group. Three independent experiments were performed.

In Vivo Antimalarial Activity of Açaí Polyphenols
In vivo antimalarial activity of açaí polyphenols
was assessed in C57BL/6JUnib mice (4–6 weeks old) obtained
from Centro de Bioterismo, UNICAMP, Brazil. All experiments and procedures
were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research at University
of Campinas (protocol number 4367-1) before starting animal studies.
Groups of five to seven female mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.)
challenged with 106P. chabaudi chabaudi AS-infected erythrocytes. After infection, the animals
were randomly divided into four groups and treated with vehicle (control)
or fraction 1 (20, 15, and 10 mg GAE/(kg day)) by gavage
twice a day for 13 consecutive days. Parasitemia was assessed daily
from day 3 to day 15 post-infection (p.i.) by collecting mouse tail
blood and counting 1000 erythrocytes in Giemsa-stained thin blood
smears. Euthanasia was performed on day 15 p.i.

Yeast-Based
Chemical Genomic Profiling
We used a collection
of ∼6000 heterozygous S. cerevisiae diploid strains (Invitrogen cat. No. 95401.H4Pool), in which one
copy of each of the predicted ORFs has been replaced by an antibiotic
resistance marker (KANMX4), flanked both 5′ and 3′ by
universal primer sequences flanking 20 bp DNA barcodes, unique to
each of the deleted ORFs10,42

The IC20 determination was performed using yeast (BY4743) cultured in 384-well
plates with initial OD600 of 0.1 in YPD (1% w/v yeast extract;
2% w/v peptone; 2% w/v glucose) in the presence of different concentrations
of fractions 1 (starting at 552 mg/L GAE) and 2 (starting at 155 mg/L GAE). Growth was monitored by absorbance (OD600) for 24 h at 30 °C and 200 rpm double orbital shaking
(BMG Clariostar, BMG Labtech Inc, Durhan, NC). Growth inhibition was
calculated relatively to untreated control and plotted against log
[compound] to determine IC20.43,44

For competition assays, log-phase cultures of the pool of
barcoded
heterozygous yeast strains42 were inoculated
in quadruplicates in fresh YPD media with the IC20 concentration
of 1 and 2 or drug-free (control) at final
OD600 0.1 in 48-well plates. Plates were incubated for
12 h at 30 °C with shaking (200 rpm) allowing growth for about
five generations. A fraction of this initial culture was diluted (1/20)
and cultivated under the same conditions as above to obtain pools
of cultures grown for ∼10, 15, and 20 generations. At each
stage, samples were harvested and the pellets were stored at −80
°C in TE buffer. Genomic DNA was extracted with the Wizard Genomic
DNA Purification Kit (Promega). DNA barcodes from the heterozygous
yeast strain pools (grown for 5–20 generations) were sequenced
using the platform Illumina HiSeq 2500 by the University of São
Paulo Genomic Centre for Sequencing. Molecular barcodes of each of
the 6000 heterozygous strains were PCR amplified using hybrid primers
containing Illumina preadaptors and the sequences U1 or U2.

For sequencing analysis, a “virtual genome” was created
based on the predicted barcode sequences. Reads of each sample were
aligned to this virtual genome and quantified per barcode. Comparing
the reads per barcode between 1 or 2 and
controls, the heterozygous strains were ranked based on their compound
sensitivity after 20 generations. Selection of strains most depleted
in treated cell populations compared to untreated population (top
hits, p-value <0.01) followed by Gene Ontology
(GO) analysis45 and Reactome Tool46 suggested either direct targets or pathways
associated with tolerance to fractions 1 or 2.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed
using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Data were analyzed
by ANOVA-Dunnett. Values were considered statistically significant
when p < 0.05.
