Fe-supported heterogeneous catalysts
are used for various reactions,
including ammonia synthesis, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and
exhaust gas cleaning. For the practical use of Fe-supported catalysts,
suppression of Fe particle agglomeration is the most important issue
to be resolved. As described herein, we found that Al doping in an
oxide support suppresses agglomeration of the supported Fe particle.
Experimental and computational studies revealed two tradeoff Al doping
effects: the Fe particle size decreased and remained without agglomeration
by virtue of the anchoring effect of doped Al. Also, some Fe atoms
anchored by Al cannot function as an active site because of bonding
with oxygen atoms. Using an appropriate amount of Al doping is effective
for increasing the number of active Fe sites and catalytic activity.
This optimized catalyst showed high practical activity and stability
for low-temperature ammonia synthesis in an electric field. The optimized
catalyst of 12.5 wt % Fe/Ce0.4Al0.1Zr0.5O2-δ showed the highest ammonia synthesis
rate (2.3 mmol g–1 h–1) achieved
to date under mild conditions (464 K, 0.9 MPa) in an electric field
among the Fe catalysts reported.

1 Introduction
For
various chemical reactions such as ammonia synthesis,1,2 Fischer–Tropsch reaction,3,4 and exhaust
gas cleaning,5 Fe-supported heterogeneous
catalysts are used widely. Activities of heterogeneous metal-supported
catalysts depend on the metallic surface area of the supported metal.
Therefore, higher dispersion and longer stability are required. To
date, various attempts have been made for supporting Fe particles
with high dispersion on the catalyst support, for example, using a
support with a higher specific surface area such as CNF (Specific
Surface Area; SSA = 150 m2 g–1),4 carbon material (SSA = 190 m2 g–1),6 using the CVD method
for supporting Fe nanoparticles,7 and so
on. Furthermore, using Al2O3 as a support is
effective because of the strong interaction between Al2O3 and Fe particles.3 However,
the supported Fe is known to be easily agglomerated during the high-temperature
reaction; 3 nm diameter particles agglomerate to 13 nm in the case
of CNF by annealing at 773 K in an N2 atmosphere. Our group
has succeeded in suppressing the agglomeration of base metal particles
(Ni and Co) by doping into perovskite oxides i.e., anchoring effects.8−11 Therefore, elemental doping into oxide is a promising method for
suppressing the agglomeration of Fe particles with high dispersion.
After synthesizing such a finely Fe-supported catalyst, it can be
used for various purposes. Recently, we have found that Fe-supported
catalysts can show higher activity in an electric field, even at low
temperatures.12 In this system, the N2H intermediate is formed by protons so that N2 dissociation
is accelerated, which contributes to high performance at lower temperatures.13−16 It is impressive that the Fe-supported catalysts show higher turnover
frequencies (TOF) than other catalysts, including Ru, in an electric
field at low temperatures.12 This is true
because intermediates (N2H) are more likely to be formed
at Fe particles than at Ru particles. Therefore, a finely dispersed
Fe catalyst is promising for this purpose. Herein, we aimed at agglomeration
suppression of a Fe-based catalyst by virtue of Al doping into a Ce–Zr–O
oxide support. We used the best Fe-supported catalyst for low-temperature
ammonia synthesis in an electric field.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Suppression of Fe Particle
Agglomeration by
Al Doping into a Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 Support
For suppressing the agglomeration of the supported Fe, we have
prescreened for various element modifications. Among them, Al doping
showed the best effect on enhancing the activities as presented in Figure 1, which would be
thanks to the suppression of the agglomeration by virtue of its strong
interaction with Fe particles. To elucidate the anchoring effects
of Al, Fe/Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ catalysts
(x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2; Fe loading amount is
5.0 wt %) were prepared and characterized by field emission transmission
electron microscope (FE-TEM) measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurement, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement.
Related FE-TEM images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX)
mappings, and the supported Fe particle size distribution for these
catalysts are shown, respectively, in Figures S1–S10. As shown in Table 1, the Fe particle size after activity tests
decreased concomitantly with increasing Al doping amounts. BET measurement
revealed that the surface area did not show any relationship with
Fe particle sizes. In addition, as shown in Figure S11 (XRD patterns), the crystal structure of Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ supports was attributed to the fluorite structure.
Although the crystalline size decreased as the Al doping amount increased,
we could not observe Al2O3 formation, and no
peak shift was observed by introducing Al either. It is said that
the limit of solubility for the doping concentration toward CeO2 is 20%, and no peak shift would be observed at the XRD pattern
either.17 So, we conclude that Al is doped
finely into Ce–Zr–O as well.

Then, the ammonia synthesis rate of the prepared
Fe/Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ catalysts in an
electric field was evaluated
at 473 K under 0.1 MPa (Figure S14). The
ammonia synthesis rate increased concomitantly, up to 10%, with increased
Al doping amounts. However, the rate decreased with further increasing
Al doping amounts despite the decrement of the Fe particle size. These
results suggest that Al doping contributed not only to the increase
of the number of active sites (i.e., the suppression of Fe agglomeration)
but also to the decrease of the activity of the active sites. Therefore,
density functional theory (DFT) calculations were done to ascertain
what factors contribute to this trend by Al doping.

2.2 Investigation of Al Doping Effects
To elucidate Al
doping effects, atomic-scale considerations were
conducted using DFT calculations. First, Fe single atoms were supported
over Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 and Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ surfaces. Figures 2 and 3, respectively,
show the adsorption sites and energies E(Fen adsorption). The adsorption energy of Fe was defined
as 1  where n denotes the number
of Fe atoms; E(Fen/support)
and E(support), respectively, represent the energies
of the support with and without Fe; and E(Fe bulk)
represents the energy of the bulk Fe model (bcc), which consists of
two Fe atoms. Smaller values represent stronger adsorption. At the
surface of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, the Fe single
atom was stable at the condition of 3 lattice oxygens (Olat) were placed. Consequently, for the surface of Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ, Fe single atoms were strongly anchored at
Olat around Al. Especially, the adsorption energies at
site 3 and site 7 over Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ (−4.83 and −4.07 eV, respectively), which were between
two doped Al, were much smaller than those over Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (−0.22 and −0.87 eV). Here,
it is reported that the interaction between the support–O–metal
is crucial for the anchoring effect,18 providing
the evidence that the Fe atom’s strong adsorption over O is
thanks to the anchoring effect.

and its energies E(Fen adsorption) of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 (color

Figure 3 Adsorption
sites of the Fe single atom and its adsorption energies E(Fen adsorption) of Ce0.5xAlxZr0.5O2−δ (color code: yellow is Ce,
green is Zr, red is O, and sky blue is Al).

Furthermore, to elucidate the anchoring effect of Al not only for
the Fe single atom but also for the Fe particle, the Fe29 cluster was set over each support (Figure 4). As a result, the E(Fe29 adsorption) decreased upon Al addition, demonstrating the
Al anchoring effect even for the Fe particle. A shortcoming of Al
doping was also inferred from the optimized structures of Fe29 clusters. Al doping led to a marked distortion of the Fe29 cluster. The Fe29 cluster periphery was partially bonded
with oxygen, as shown in the enlarged picture (Figure 4). This phenomenon was explained in an earlier
report indicating that Al2O3 addition to Fe-based
catalysts engenders Fe and Al complex oxides.19 The results indicate that a part of the three-phase boundary (TPB),
which is the reaction site for ammonia synthesis in an electric field,14−16 cannot function as an active site because of the high coordination
number of Fe atoms at that point. Therefore, we concluded that the
tradeoff between the benefits and shortcomings of Al doping causes
the volcano-type relation (Figure S14).

is Fe).

2.3 Utilization
of Ce0.4Al0.1Zr0.5O2-δ Support for Practical
Ammonia Synthesis
As described above, we suppressed the agglomeration
of Fe particles by doping appropriate amounts of Al. Therefore, optimization
of the Fe loading weight was conducted (Table S1). Among the tested catalysts, 12.5 wt % Fe/Ce0.4Al0.1Zr0.5O2−δ showed
the highest activity at 473 K under 0.1 MPa. The Fe particle size
over 12.5 wt % Fe/Ce0.4Al0.1Zr0.5O2−δ was 24.8 nm, which was much smaller
in spite of such a high Fe loading weight.

Thereafter, for practical
applications, the performance of the optimized catalyst was evaluated
at various temperatures and total pressures (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 MPa)
with or without the electric field. As presented in Figure 5, under 0.9 MPa with the electric
field, a markedly high ammonia synthesis rate was obtained as 2.3
mmol g–1 h–1, even at 464 K. The
obtained ammonia synthesis rate is the highest value achieved to date
under such mild conditions. Consequently, using the optimized Fe-based
catalysts with the electric field resulted in a high rate of ammonia
synthesis under mild conditions, which is suitable for on-site/on-demand
production.

an electric field under various catalyst bed temperatures and total
pressures. Catalyst, 400 mg; reactant gas, N2/H2 = 1:3; total flow rate, 960 SCCM; current, 6 mA.

3 Conclusions
We prepared a highly dispersed
Fe-supported catalyst through Al
doping into a Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 support.
From activity tests conducted in an electric field, a volcano-type
relation was observed between the ammonia synthesis rate and Al doping
amounts. We identified Ce0.4Al0.1Zr0.5O2−δ as the best support for low-temperature
ammonia synthesis in an electric field. DFT calculations revealed
that the anchoring effect of doped Al suppressed the agglomeration
of Fe. A part of Fe atoms anchored by Al cannot work as an active
site because of bonding with oxygen atoms. Therefore, excess amounts
of Al doping decrease the number of active sites. The optimized catalyst,
12.5 wt % Fe/Ce0.4Al0.1Zr0.5O2−δ, shows a high ammonia synthesis rate of 2.3
mmol g–1 h–1 under 464 K and 0.9
MPa. In fact, the ammonia formation rate is the highest value achieved
to date under such mild conditions. This study revealed that Al doping
in the support can suppress the agglomeration of supported Fe particles
and revealed that the Fe-supported catalyst over the Al-doped support
can act as the best catalyst for high-activity ammonia synthesis at
low temperatures in the electric field.

4 Experimental
and Computational Sections
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
For the catalyst
support of ammonia synthesis in an electric field, Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 is known to be a good candidate.16 Modification of the catalyst support with other
elements including Al and other base metals is investigated. For Al,
Ca, and Ba doping, various doped Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 oxide samples are prepared using a complex polymerization
method: Ce0.5–xAlxZr0.5O2−δ (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2), Ce0.4Ca0.1Zr0.5O2−δ, and Ce0.4Ba0.1Zr0.5O2−δ. First, ethylene
glycol (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) and citric acid monohydrate (Kanto
Chemical Co., Inc.) were dissolved in distilled water and stirred.
Then, stoichiometric amounts of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.), ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.), Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.),
and Ba(NO3)2 (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) were
added to the solution and stirred. The solution was heated at 343
K in a water bath overnight. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was
dried into a powder on a hot plate. The obtained powder was calcined
at 773 K for 5 h (5 K min–1).

Fe was loaded
on the prepared supports by a liquid-phase reduction method using
Fe(NO3)·9H2O (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.)
as a Fe precursor. First, the support was dispersed in an aqueous
solution of the Fe precursor and was stirred for 1 h. Subsequently,
the slurry was heated at 393 K on a hot plate by stirring for 1 h.
Then, a 10% N2H4 aqueous solution as a reducing
agent was added to the slurry and was stirred at 393 K for 1 h. Finally,
the resultant mixture was filtered. The filtrated cake was dried in
an oven at 393 K overnight.

4.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurement was conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab
3; Rigaku Corp.) with a Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and
40 mA in the 2θ range of 10–90° at a scan rate of
20° min–1. The supported Fe particles were
observed using a field emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM;
HF-2200; Hitachi Ltd.) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer
(EDX). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method (Gemini
VII 2390a; Micromeritics Instrument Corp.) was used to obtain the
specific surface area by nitrogen adsorption. All samples were pretreated
at 473 K for 1 h under an N2 atmosphere.

4.3 Activity Tests
Catalytic activity
tests were conducted using a fixed-bed flow-type reactor equipped
with a quartz tube under 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 MPa. The catalyst was sieved
into particles of 355–500 μm sizes. Then, 100 or 400
mg of it was charged to the reactor. After stainless steel (SUS304)
rods were inserted into the catalyst bed as electrodes, 6 mA of direct
current was applied using a DC power supply. The catalyst bed temperature
was measured directly using a thermocouple attached to the bottom
of the catalyst bed. A digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS2001; Tektronix
Inc.) was used to detect the response voltage. The reaction gas was
N2:H2 = 1:3 (total flow rate: 240 or 960 SCCM).
Pretreatment to activate the catalyst was conducted at 773 K for 1
h before activity tests. The produced ammonia was trapped into distilled
water. An ion-chromatograph (IC-2001; Tosoh Corp.) was used to quantitate
ammonia.

4.4 Computational Details
4.4.1 Electronic
Structure Calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were conducted using
the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP) 5.4.4.20−23 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) version was adapted for the exchange-correlation functional.24 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was
used for the representation of ion-core electron interactions. A plane-wave
basis set with 400 eV energy cutoff was used for representing the
valence electrons. All calculation results included the effects of
spin polarization. Monkhorst–Pack grids with (5 × 5 ×
5) and (1 × 1 × 1) were adapted for of the bulk and slab
models Ce0.5Zr0.5O2. Furthermore,
the (10 × 10 × 10) grid was used for the bulk Fe calculation,
which contains two Fe atoms in a unit cell. The geometry optimization
threshold was set to 10–5 eV. The van der Waals
forces were corrected using the DFT-D3 method of Grimme.25 We used the DFT + U method
to correct the localization of Ce 4f orbitals, as reported earlier.26

4.4.2 Computational Models
Calculation
models were constructed in a manner similar to our reported model.26 First, the lattice constant of Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 was optimized using the bulk structure.
Then, the surface was expressed as (4 × 4) with O–Ce–O
(or O–Zr–O) tri-layers (Figure S15). Each slab was separated by 20 Å vacuum layers. For Al doping
models, two uppermost surface Ce atoms were replaced. The element
portion of the surface used in calculations was as follows: Ce:Zr:Al
= 0.33:0.5:0.17. This is almost the same as that of supports used
in actual experiments. The atomic configuration options are presented
in Figure S16. Two Al atoms favorably sit
side-by-side. In addition, the oxygen vacancy formation for the charge
compensation was an endothermic reaction. These trends showed great
agreement with those over the Al-doped CeO2(111) surface.26 Therefore, the model without oxygen vacancy
(shown in Figure S17) was used for the
following considerations. During geometry optimization, the bottom
layer was fixed, and the isolated O2 was arranged in a
10 × 10 × 10 Å cubic box. The energy of the O2 molecule and bcc-Fe bulk was calculated at the Γ point. The
calculated models were depicted using Visualization for Electronic
and Structural Analysis (VESTA).27 The
size of the Fe cluster was restricted by the surface area of the slab
model. In the calculation, as shown in Figure S18, the cluster was constructed by slicing Fe bulk structures
along with the Miller indexes (010) and (111). From top to bottom
of the cluster, the Fe atom numbers were 4, 9, and 16, and its total
was 29.
