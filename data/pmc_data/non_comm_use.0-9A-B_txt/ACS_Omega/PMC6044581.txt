Antibiotic
resistance is one of the
most serious challenges that the world is currently facing. The number
of people succumbing to drug-resistant infections is increasing every
day, but the rate of drug discovery has failed to match the requisite
demands. Most of the currently known antibiotics target the three
essential pathways of central dogma. However, bacteria have evolved
multiple mechanisms to survive these antibiotics. Consequently, there
is an urgent necessity to target auxiliary pathways for the discovery
of new drugs. Metabolism-related and stress-associated pathways are
ideal in this regard. The stringent response pathway regulated by
the signaling nucleotides (p)ppGpp is an attractive target as inhibition
of the pathway would in turn decrease the persistence and long-term
survival of pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, we focus on
the recent design of small molecule analogues of (p)ppGpp that have
yielded promising results in terms of growth and biofilm inhibition.
Additionally, we discuss how targeting small RNAs and riboswitches,
as well as antimicrobial peptides, would help combat drug-resistant
infections in the near future.

1 Introduction
Antibiotics have been
the foremost
weapon wielded by mankind in our war against pathogenic microorganisms,
but several decades after the discovery of antibiotics, the microbes
have fought back valiantly with a host of strategies to survive them.
Prior to the discovery of antibiotics, a microbial infection was most
often synonymous with death of the infected human being. Sulfa drugs
were the first tools used to fight pathogens.1 Subsequently, the serendipitous discovery of penicillin in 1929
heralded the “golden era of antibiotics”, in which several
new antibiotics were discovered by humans that helped them win the
war against these microbes.1,2,3 Since then, antibiotic resistance has become a global health concern.
More than 2 million people every year are infected with antibiotic-resistant
infections in the United States alone. Drug-resistant infections lead
to approximately 23 000 deaths in the United States and 25 000
deaths in Europe per annum, and the number is much higher in developing
countries.4 Apart from the loss of lives,
these infections also lead to billions being spent on healthcare and
treatment. The current pace of drug development is insufficient to
mitigate the severe threat of drug-resistant infections. This necessitates
an urgent need to develop a deeper understanding of the reasons behind
the emergence of antibiotic resistance and to develop tools to combat
it.

1.1 Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance
The
word “antibiotic” is derived from “anti”
(meaning against) and “biotikus” (meaning fit for life),
and therefore, it literally means “life-killing”. The
term antibiotic has been hereafter used in this review to describe
both naturally derived and chemically synthesized antibacterial drugs.
After the clinical success of penicillin, the microbial world was
explored for the presence of other similar antibiotics. Several metabolites
extracted from environmental microbes were studied for their effect
on growth of pathogens. This mining for antibiotics from the environment
proved extremely successful, leading to the discovery of several potent
antibiotics like streptomycin.3 Subsequently,
medicinal chemistry helped the synthesis of several chemically derived
drugs like para-aminosalicylic acid. These were synthesized
based on natural antibiotic scaffolds, and they helped to expand the
spectrum of antibiotics available. The naturally derived antibiotics
evolved to cross bacterial cell membranes, but chemically synthesized
drugs often needed several modifications to reach the same efficacy.
Most antibiotics target the cellular processes of translation, transcription,
replication, and cell wall synthesis (Figure 1).3 Antibiotics
often exert complex effects in vivo and may have multiple cellular
targets. The most commonly used antibiotics include the β-lactams,
which inhibit cell wall synthesis and include cephalosporins, carbapenems,
and penicillins. Other cell wall synthesis inhibitors include glycopeptide
antibiotics like vancomycin. Protein synthesis inhibitors include
aminoglycosides (e.g., kanamycin), tetracyclines, chloramphenicols,
macrolides (e.g., eyrthromycin), oxazolidinones (e.g., linezolid),
and streptogramins (e.g., pristinamycin). Rifamycins constitute transcription
inhibitors, and quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) inhibit DNA synthesis
by binding to gyrase. Another class of antibiotics commonly used are
the sulfonamides, which are inhibitors of folate synthesis.

Figure 1 Different classes
of antibiotics and their mechanism of action.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed several pathogens
that have developed high levels of resistance across the world.1,3 Among these, the “ESKAPE” pathogens are extremely
important and include Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter
baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.5Enterobacteriaceae spp. (Escherichia
coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Providencia spp.), Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, and Shigella spp. strains have shown high levels
of drug resistance. There is growing resistance to carbapenems, cephalosporins,
fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. Most Enterobacteriaceae strains have developed resistance against third generation carbapenems. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of
tuberculosis (TB), is the most common reason behind death from an
infectious pathogen. Tuberculosis (TB) killed approximately 1.5 million
people in 2015, and the emergence of multiple-drug-resistant TB and
extensively drug-resistant TB strains has made global eradication
of TB an extremely challenging task.6

1.2 Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance
Understanding
the mechanism behind antibiotic resistance is the primary
step in developing ways to combat it. Bacteria can be intrinsically
resistant to antibiotics or can acquire the trait.4 For example, M. tuberculosis is intrinsically resistant to the β-lactam group of antibiotics
as it encodes a β-lactamase enzyme in its genome.7 Also, most antibiotics have different efficacies
in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria due to intrinsic differences
in the cell wall composition. Several studies in the past few years
have led to the identification of multiple genes responsible for intrinsic
antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

Antibiotic resistance can
be acquired by bacteria through chromosomal mutations or via horizontal
gene transfer from other bacteria. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
can develop mainly due to three mechanisms (Figure 2):(i) Decreased influx or increased efflux
of antibiotics:

Antibiotic entry into the cell is mainly through
porins present in the outer membrane.4 A
decreased cellular expression of porins or mutations in the porin
genes leads to reduced entry of the antibiotic into the cell, making
it less effective. Bacteria possess multidrug efflux pumps that are
responsible for the active export of antibiotics from the cell. Several
of these pumps have been identified in bacteria, and mutations in
their gene sequences or their overexpression leads to increased antibiotic
efflux from the cell.

(ii) Modification of antibiotics:

Once the antibiotic enters the
cell, the resistant bacteria either
enzymatically degrade it or modify it in such a way that it cannot
bind its own target.4 Enzymes that degrade
antibiotics are present in several bacteria. Variants of β-lactamases
are encoded in bacteria, each of which can degrade several β-lactam
antibiotics. Bacteria resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics
have emerged, and new classes of β-lactamases have been identified
in pathogenic bacteria like K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, etc. Also, there are several known enzymes that can transfer chemical
groups like phosphate, acyl, nucleotidyl, etc. to the antibiotic molecules.
These modified antibiotics then have decreased affinity to their targets,
thereby reducing their efficacy. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are known
to be modified by acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases, as
well as phosphotransferases.

(iii) Modification of the antibiotic target:
Another mechanism of decreasing antibiotic efficacy is to mutate,
modify, or protect their cellular targets thereby interfering with
the binding of the antibiotics.4 However,
only those mutations that lead to reduced antibiotic binding without
affecting the protein activity are favored. Rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis strains, for example, contain mutations
in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of
RNA polymerase (target of rifampicin).7 Similarly, methylation of ribosome confers resistance to ribosome-targeting
antibiotics. Methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by Erm methyltransferase
confers resistance to macrolide antibiotics.4 Bacteria can also acquire a gene encoding a homologue of a drug
target that does not bind to the drug. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) possesses a penicillin-binding protein
PBP2a in addition to the chromosomally encoded PBP.8 PBP is inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics but PBP2a
is resistant to the action of β-lactam antibiotics so the cell
can still carry out cell wall synthesis. Alternatively, bacteria can
synthesize a molecule mimicking the antibiotic target that binds to
the antibiotic and reduces its effective concentration. One such example
is the MfpA protein in M. tuberculosis, which consists of pentapeptide repeats and mimics the shape and
charge of B-DNA. It provides resistance to quinolones by binding to
DNA gyrase (target of quinolones) in place of DNA, which reduces the
availability of gyrase for binding to quinolones.9



Figure 2 Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. There
are three main ways
by which bacteria can increase their resistance: (a) varying the efflux
of antibiotics; (b) modifying the antibiotics; or (c) modifying their
targets.

Antibiotic resistance can be governed
by a network of regulatory
proteins, which include sigma factors and transcription factors. For
example, in Mycobacteria, the transcription factor WhiB7 is induced
upon antibiotic stress and regulates expression of several antibiotic
resistance-associated genes like tap (a multidrug
transporter) and ermMT (ribosomal methyltransferase).10 As a consequence, upregulation of expression
of such transcription factors leads to increased drug resistance.
Expression of several efflux pumps is also regulated at the transcriptional
level.4

The genes responsible for
antibiotic resistance can be transmitted
from one bacteria to another. Because antibiotics are naturally produced
by bacteria, the other bacteria in the environment often encode genes
that provide resistance to those antibiotics, thereby ensuring their
own survival. Such genes form a part of the soil “resistome”
and can be transferred to the pathogenic bacteria.4

1.2.1 Bacterial Persistence
Another phenomenon
that leads to low clearance of bacterial infections is persistence.11 The killing phase of bacteria by antibiotics
has two phases: a rapid killing phase in which most bacteria are killed
by the antibiotic and another stagnant phase in which a low number
of bacteria persist and are not killed. If the antibiotic is removed,
these persister bacteria (or “persisters”) again start
multiplying within the host. This leads to slow clearance of the infection
and recurrent bacterial infections. Persistent bacteria are different
from resistant bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations required
for inhibiting the growth of persistent bacterial cells is the same
as that of the wild type cells, and they are not genetically different.
Unlike resistant bacteria, persisters can resume growth only once
the antibiotic stress is removed (Figure 3). Persistence is a widespread phenomenon
observed in most bacteria. M. tuberculosis is one of the main human pathogens in which persistence has been
observed. The treatment for M. tuberculosis includes a combination of drugs like rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide,
and ethambutol.6 The duration of the treatment
is a minimum of 6 months and a relapse of infection is commonly observed.
Therefore, the clinical burden due to bacterial persistence is a major
concern. In this regard, the study of persistence and its underlying
mechanisms has become highly significant.

Figure 3 Difference between antibiotic-resistant
bacteria and persisters.
Resistant bacteria can survive and multiply even in high antibiotic
concentration. An isogenic bacterial culture has a low percentage
of persisters that survive the antibiotic stress, then regrow once
the antibiotic stress is removed. These persisters are as sensitive
to antibiotics as the initial population.

Persisters are often present as a small fraction of cells
in an
isogenic bacterial culture.12 This “bet-hedging
strategy” is said to be a survival strategy under fluctuating
environment conditions. Persistence can be stochastically activated
or can be environmentally triggered by stress. The signaling nucleotides
guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine pentaphosphate (collectively
referred to as (p)ppGpp) are the key regulators of the stress response
in bacteria. Under nutrient-limiting conditions or stress, (p)ppGpp
orchestrates a stress response known as “stringent response”
in which the entire cellular machinery is reprogrammed to switch from
energy-consuming processes (like replication and rRNA synthesis) to
those processes essential for survival. The connection between (p)ppGpp
and persistence has been well-characterized and (p)ppGpp has been
implicated in several pathways leading to persistence.

(p)ppGpp
has been proposed to affect antibiotic tolerance of bacteria
via an active stringent response or a passive growth arrest. An active
stringent response rather than a passive growth arrest has been shown
to lead to antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa.(13) One of the mechanisms by which antibiotics
are proposed to kill bacterial cells is by increasing the reactive
oxygen species. (p)ppGpp has been shown to improve antioxidant defenses
by upregulating specific genes that help in survival during antibiotic
stress. Growth arrest leads to inactivity of antibiotic targets thereby
leading to survival of bacteria. In a slow growing cell or a dormant
cell, processes like replication, translation, and cell wall synthesis
are switched off so that the antibiotics cannot act on their targets.
Strains devoid of (p)ppGpp have been shown to have lower levels of
persistence in cases like M. tuberculosis.

Persistence can arise via multiple pathways.12 Toxin–antitoxin modules (TA modules) are composed
of a stable toxin protein that inhibits cell growth and an unstable
antitoxin that neutralizes the function of the toxins. Antitoxins
can either be proteins or antisense RNA, and are classified based
on the mechanism employed by them to counteract the action of the
toxins. TA
systems have been categorized into different clases based on their
mode of action, and the transcriptome of persister cells revealed
their upregulation in E. coli and M. tuberculosis. A model proposing the role of (p)ppGpp
involves inhibition of the enzyme exopolyphosphase Ppx by (p)ppGpp,
which leads to inhibition in polyphosphate degradation.14 Polyphosphate activates Lon protease, which
degrades the antitoxin leading to the toxin level becoming high and
causing growth arrest. A bacterial SOS response to DNA damage also
triggers persistence via TA-dependent modules or other pathways. E. coli lacking SOS genes (e.g., recA) display a low frequency of persister formation and are more susceptible
to quinolones antibiotics. The stationary phase in bacteria also increases
persister formation. (p)ppGpp helps to elevate the stationary phase
sigma factor σS, which increases persister formation
due its role in stress-related pathways.12 Environmental cues (like stress in phagocytic vacuoles) can trigger
persister formation via (p)ppGpp. Persister formation can also be
enhanced by treatment with sublethal concentrations of antibiotic.
Metabolic transitions during diauxic growth in bacteria have also
been shown to increase persister formation.15 Stress response and persistence have been demonstrated to be linked
with increased mutation frequency, which could lead to development
of antibiotic resistance (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Effect of (p)ppGpp on antibiotic tolerance and persister
formation.
(p)ppGpp can lead to antibiotic tolerance via passive growth arrest
or an active starvation response. It also leads to increased persister
formation via multiple mechanisms.

1.2.2 Biofilm Formation
Biofilms are
structured communities of microbes growing on surfaces or at air–liquid
interfaces.16 They are formed when microbes
are embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix composed of proteins,
extracellular DNA, lipids, polysaccharides, and water. Several bacterial
species like P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, etc. have been
shown to form biofilms. Biofilms are recalcitrant to antibiotics and
the presence of a high number of persisters in biofilms is attributed
as the major reason. They have been frequently observed growing on
implanted medical devices inside the host. Because these biofilms
are highly resistant to most antibiotics, the infections are difficult
to eradicate. Anti-biofilm drugs are, therefore, the need of the hour.
(p)ppGpp has been implicated in biofilm formation in multiple species
like P. aeruginosa, M. tuberculosis, etc.16,17

2 Combating Antibiotic Resistance
The golden era of antibiotics
led to the discovery of several important
antibiotics, but the last decade has yielded very few potential drugs
on account of various reasons. This has set the alarm bells ringing
as we may be soon out of antibiotics to treat these drug-resistant
infections. Most antibiotics used currently are derived from species
like Actinomycetes.3 In the past, antibiotics
were discovered in a randomized manner by mining environmental microbes
for their metabolites and testing them against pathogens. Any compound
that showed antibacterial activity was considered a putative drug,
with no need to decipher its underlying mechanism of action. However,
with the advent of genome sequencing, a more targeted approach can
be followed for the discovery of new drugs. Transposon mutagenesis
led to the generation of libraries with mutants of each gene in an
organism. The growth profiles of these mutants or knockout strains
reveal information about the essentiality of a gene product, which
in turn is the determining factor in deciding its potential as a drug
target. Essential genes are considered ideal candidates as any drug
targeting the gene product would then cause cell death. This led to
the “essential gene paradox” in drug discovery in which
only essential genes were considered as drug targets. However, the
importance of “conditionally essential” genes has only
recently been explored. It is known that pathogens have to survive
hostile conditions inside the host. Hence, they have evolved multiple
pathways that are triggered only under exposure to specific stress
conditions. A particular protein may be, therefore, crucial for their
survival inside the host, but may not be needed for growth in vitro.
Under normal testing conditions, the mutant strains are grown on rich
media and tested for any growth defects on addition of potential antibiotics.
A conditionally essential gene, like a starvation-activated gene for
example, may not show a phenotype under such medium conditions but
would show growth defects when the bacteria are grown under nutrient-limiting
conditions. Such genes would also make suitable drug targets and in
turn expand the available pool of drug targets several fold.

An important parameter for a successful drug is the ability to
kill the infecting organism without harming the host. Thus, the macromolecular
synthesis pathways of replication, transcription, and translation
are often targeted. However, on the flip side, the need for survival
drives the pathogens to mutate in such a way that core metabolism
remains intact. Thus, it is increasingly being felt that auxiliary
pathways need to be targeted where the pressure of mutations will
be far less.

With the aim of decreasing bacterial persistence,
drugs targeting
pathways of persister formation or biofilm formation would be a landmark
discovery. These drugs can then be given in combination with the usual
drug regimen for a bacterial infection.

3 Development
of Stringent Response Inhibitors
As mentioned earlier, the
stringent response pathway governed by
the signaling nucleotides (p)ppGpp plays a vital role in the stress
response of a cell. (p)ppGpp not only affects persistence and biofilm
formation but also regulates transcription of various genes required
for virulence and long-term survival.18 As stress conditions (e.g., nutrient limitation) are often encountered
by bacteria inside the host, a stringent response is activated. This
makes (p)ppGpp an ideal drug target. The absence of a similar pathway
in humans is an added advantage. A precise balance of (p)ppGpp levels
is required for proper cell function, as too little (p)ppGpp affects
survival under stress and too much (p)ppGpp is toxic to the cell due
to its effect on GTP levels. One way to affect (p)ppGpp-mediated pathways
is to synthesize structural analogues of (p)ppGpp. The concept of
inhibitor design deals with the synthesis of substrate or product
analogues that can bind to and then turn off key enzymes in the cell.
Good expertize in chemistry is essential for this process.

(p)ppGpp
is synthesized in vivo by the protein Rel.18 The first (p)ppGpp analogue designed and synthesized
by Wexselblatt et al. was based on a crystal structure of Rel from Streptococcus equisimilis, and was named relacin
(Figure 5).19 Relacin is a 2′-deoxyguanosine-based
analogue of ppGpp, and glycine–glycine dipeptides are linked
to the sugar ring by a carbamate bridge replacing the pyrophosphate
residues in ppGpp. In silico analyses revealed that it interacts with
Rel through hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. Relacin affected
sporulation as well as long-term survival in Bacillus
subtilis. This paved the way for development of other
stringent response inhibitors. Subsequently, the same group synthesized
relacin analogs with different substitutions at the 3′ and
5′ positions of 2′-deoxyguanosine.20 One of the analogues was found to be more potent than relacin
and showed 80% inhibition of Rel-mediated (p)ppGpp synthesis at 1
mM concentration. The isobutyryl group at the second position in the
guanine moiety of relacin was found to be important for its activity.
With the aim of synthesizing more potent Rel inhibitors, Syal et al.
modified guanosine at this C-2 position to synthesize acetylated and
acetylated benzoylated derivatives of guanosine (Figure 5).21 The acetylated benzoylated compound showed 50% inhibition at 40
μM and 75% inhibition at 100 μM. Addition of this compound
led to inhibition of biofilm formation by M. tuberculosis. It also led to decreased long-term survival and cellular (p)ppGpp
levels in Mycobacterium smegmatis.
The compound was shown to be cell wall permeable in human lung epithelial
cells and nontoxic to H460 cells. With information from the crystal
structures of (p)ppGpp bound to its synthetases and effector proteins,
more such analogues can be designed and synthesized chemically.

Figure 5 Design of stringent
response inhibitors. Relacin is a structural
analogue of ppGpp. Guanosine was chemically modified to synthesize
acetylated and acetylated benzoylated derivatives that inhibit Rel.
Vitamin C is a natural analogue that resembles GDP in structure.

A recent study showed that vitamin
C inhibits M.
tuberculosis growth at high concentrations.22 Syal et al. proposed vitamin C to be an inhibitor
of stringent response and demonstrated its binding to Rel (Figure 5).23 Addition of vitamin C inhibited (p)ppGpp synthesis by Rel
in vitro as well as reduced in vivo (p)ppGpp levels and biofilm formation
in M. smegmatis. Thus, this opens up
opportunities to test vitamin C alone against bacterial infections.

It must be noted that multiple Gram-positive species like B. subtilis possess additional (p)ppGpp synthetases
that are smaller in size, as compared to Rel, and are upregulated
under different stresses. Relacin was found to be ineffective against
one such synthetase from Enterococcus faecalis.24 Interestingly, recent studies have
shown that some of these small (p)ppGpp synthetases are regulated
both by (p)ppGpp as well as RNA.25 As these
synthetases also affect antibiotic tolerance in bacteria, future studies
should take them into consideration when designing stringent response
inhibitors.

Apart from (p)ppGpp, bacteria employ other nucleotide
derivatives
like cyclic-AMP, cyclic-di-GMP, cyclic-di-AMP, and cyclic-GMP-AMP
as signaling molecules.26 Each signaling
molecule is activated under particular stress conditions; it then
activates a cascade of downstream pathways that lead to a particular
stress-associated phenotype like biofilm formation. These signaling
molecules, similar to (p)ppGpp, regulate several important pathways
related to cell division, quorum sensing, virulence, biofilm formation,
motility, antibiotic resistance, etc. Disrupting these signaling pathways
would therefore affect the bacterial survival, and in the future,
more research should be undertaken to develop inhibitors of these
signaling nucleotides. This could be achieved by synthesizing structural
analogues of these compounds or by targeting their effectors, which
can be either proteins or RNA.

4 Anti-Biofilm Peptides
As mentioned previously, biofilms are the product of an adaptation
mechanism to stress, and eradicating them would help significantly
in combating resistant bacterial infections.27 One class of inhibitors being screened for use against biofilms
are peptides.28 In general, natural antimicrobial
peptides are 12–50 amino acids in length. They are cationic,
amphipathic, consist of around 50% hydrophobic residues, and vary
significantly in sequence and structure. The human cathelicidin peptide
LL-37 was demonstrated to have an anti-biofilm effect in Pseudomonas.29 LL-37 is also capable of modulating
human immune response and is active against MRSA. Subsequently, chemically
synthesized peptides of smaller length have been tested for their
anti-biofilm properties. These were mostly designed based on mutation
of the natural peptides and then screened for inhibition of biofilm
formation and biofilm disruption. Peptides IDR 1002 and HH2 are 12-mers
that showed anti-biofilm activity against S. aureus biofilms and were subsequently improved to generate peptide 2009
with an overall improved profile.30 In
a subsequent study, d-enantiomeric, including retro (d-amino acid sequence) and retro-inverse (reversed d-amino acid sequence), anti-biofilm peptide 1018 was designed and
tested against biofilms of pathogenic bacteria.31 The peptides were made by utilizing only 9 of 20 amino
acids, and they had 4 charged residues and 7 or 8 hydrophobic residues.
These peptides were successful in eradicating mature biofilms and
were synergistic with conventional antibiotics. The d-enantiomeric
peptides DJK-5 (VQWRAIRVRVIR) and DJK-6 (VQWRRIRVWVIR) showed better
activity as compared to that of their l-enantiomeric counterparts
as they were protease-resistant (Figure 6). Most of these anti-biofilm peptides are
broad-spectrum and inhibit biofilm formation in multiple bacterial
species. Some of these anti-biofilm peptides were proposed to target
(p)ppGpp but this was later disputed.32 Other naturally derived peptides and their synthetic derivatives
have recently shown promising results in combating mycobacterial infections.33 As chemical peptide synthesis has become more
rapid and economical, peptides with increased efficacy and cellular
permeability can be designed. Peptide sequences can be rationally
designed such that they specifically target key proteins crucial for
virulence and persistence.

Figure 6 Inhibition of biofilm formation by the d-enantiomer peptide
DJK-5 in flow cells. The peptide DJK-5 was provided along with other
conventional antibiotics and succeeded in preventing biofilm formation
by different pathogenic bacteria. At day 0, a subinhibitory concentration
of DJK-5 plus antibiotic was added into the flow-through medium of
the flow cell apparatus. The biofilm formation was monitored for 3
days. Subsequently, the live bacterial cells were stained with Syto-9
stain and the dead bacterial cells were stained with propidium iodide
(merge shows as yellow to red) prior to confocal imaging. Each panel
shows reconstructions from the top in the large panel and sides in
the right and bottom panels (xy, yz, and xz dimensions). (Reproduced with permission—de

5 Small RNAs and Riboswitches
Protein translation,
which requires ribosomal proteins and ribosomal
RNA (rRNA), is one of the pathways targeted by most antibiotics. However,
other noncoding RNAs have so far failed to be the target of any antibiotic
available in the market. The past few years have led to substantial
knowledge of the mechanisms behind functioning of noncoding RNAs like
riboswitches and small RNAs (sRNA). Riboswitches play an important
role in regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional or translation
level.34 They arise from the 5′
untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA of the gene that they regulate.
Riboswitches contain an aptamer domain (30–200 nucleotides)
along with an expression platform. The expression platform has terminator
sequences or anti-terminator sequences that are mutually exclusive
and with different conformations. Upon binding of the ligand, it attains
one of the conformations, thereby affecting transcription (Figure 7). The conformation
change in the expression platform might also affect the ribosome binding
at the ribosome binding site, thereby impeding translation. Riboswitches
are present in most bacteria like M. tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, and S. pneumoniae but are absent in mammals, making them
potential drug targets.34 They regulate
important cellular pathways, especially metabolic pathways, and multiple
ligands controlling riboswitches have been classified. These ligands
include certain amino acids, purines, thiamines, flavin mononucleotide
(FMN), as well as c-di-GMP.26,34 A riboflavin analogue
called roseoflavin was discovered in 1974, but its underlying mechanism
of FMN riboswitch inhibition was discovered much later in 2009.35 This riboswitch controls the riboflavin (vitamin
B2) biosynthesis pathway, which is a precursor to synthesizing cofactors
like FMN. The pathway is essential in the absence of riboflavin in
the environment, and is essential in M. tuberculosis as it lacks riboflavin transport genes. This inspired the subsequent
discovery of another selective synthetic inhibitor of FMN riboswitch
named “ribocil” (Figure 8).36 Ribocil was found to
interact with the FMN riboswitch at the same domain as FMN to shut
down the riboflavin synthesis, despite their chemical structures being
quite dissimilar to one another. Ribocil showed promising results
in infected mice and decreased the bacterial load by 1000-fold. High-throughput
screening strategies and structure-guided ligand docking have been
used to identify small molecule inhibitors of riboswitches.37 These screening strategies also require development
of assays for riboswitch binding. Most often, this is achieved by
using displacement assays involving displacement of a fluorescent
ligand by a non-fluorescent one from the compound library. Chemical
perturbation of the natural ligands or the potential small molecule
candidates identified by such high-throughput screening is then done
to increase their specificity and affinity. Further studies are needed
to design and synthesize such small molecule inhibitors of other riboswitches
as well so as to target other pathways essential for stress survival
and pathogenesis.

Figure 7 Representation of FMN riboswitch. Upon binding of FMN
to the aptamer,
there is a conformational change in the expression platform leading
to the formation of a terminator/sequester loop, thereby abolishing
gene expression. Absence of FMN leads to an alternate conformation
involving an anti-terminator/anti-sequester loop that facilitates
transcription. (Reproduced with permission: Howe et al., 2015.)

ribocil.

sRNAs are regulatory RNAs that
range from 40 to 500 nucleotides
in length.37 They can arise from 5′
or 3′ UTRs of mRNAs and also from transcription of dedicated
genes.38 Although they are not essential,
they regulate pathways associated with biofilm formation, virulence,
antibiotic resistance, and other stress-associated pathways.39 sRNAs can be positive or negative regulators
of gene expression and generally mediate their action by binding to
a target mRNA in the presence of a RNA chaperone protein like Hfq.
Antibiotics that inhibit transcription inhibit sRNA synthesis as well.
However, sRNAs have a limited structural complexity making it difficult
to design inhibitors for them. An alternative strategy to target sRNAs
is to target the Hfq protein. sRNAs could also be modulated by antisense
technology. Recently, screening a library of cyclic peptides led to
the discovery of several in vitro inhibitors of Hfq activity.40 This was achieved by employing a reporter assay
with a Hfq–sRNA controlled expression of a fluorescent protein.
With more sRNAs and RNA chaperones being characterized, this could
lead to the discovery of potential drugs.

6 Conclusions
The current pace of antibiotic discovery is not sufficient to combat
antibiotic resistance, necessitating the development of alternate
strategies. In this regard, antibacterial compounds that are not standalone
drugs but are synergistic with the conventional antibiotics would
be a step forward. Most antibiotics either target the three processes
of the central dogma or the cell wall metabolism, and there is a need
to look beyond these processes for identifying new drug targets. Attacking
the stress-associated pathways is therefore a promising strategy for
eliminating infections. Chemical design and synthesis of structural
analogues of signaling nucleotides like (p)ppGpp is one such way.
sRNAs and riboswitches governing stress-related pathways can be targeted
by rational design of small molecule inhibitors. Peptide inhibitors
of biofilms have also shown impressive results in killing antibiotic-resistant
strains. Additionally, several drugs targeting metabolism and respiration
are in clinical trials.41 Improving respiration
in M. tuberculosis persister cells
by adding thiols led to the cells becoming metabolically active and
hence drug-susceptible.42M. tuberculosis experiences acid stress inside phagosomes
and a diamide derivative AC2P36 has been synthesized that kills M. tuberculosis at low pH by affecting thiol stress.43 Another example of a non-essential protein proven
to be a good drug candidate is the enzyme tryptophan synthase against
which a small molecule allosteric inhibitor (a synthetic azetidine
derivative) has shown remarkable results in M. tuberculosis.44 Although these studies were performed
in M. tuberculosis, similar strategies
could be applicable in other pathogenic bacteria as well. An alternate
approach is to improve efficacy of current antibiotics by chemical
modification or other means like addition of adjuvants. Drug accumulation
inside bacteria varies according to cell wall properties as well as
physicochemical properties of the drug, and therefore, a systematic
analysis of a large number of compounds is useful in drug design and
modification.45 Spiroisoxazoline molecules
called “small molecules aborting resistance” (SMARt)
have been recently developed that activate alternate pathways of the
prodrug ethionamide, thereby reverting acquired resistance in M. tuberculosis.46 Genome
and metabolome data of several clinical isolates of pathogenic strains
have shed more light on mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and revealed
new cellular pathways as potential drug targets. Rationalized chemical
design of inhibitors of such pathways should lead to development of
more drugs in the near future.
