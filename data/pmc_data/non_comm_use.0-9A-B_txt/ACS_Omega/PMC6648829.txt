Printed electronics fill the niches
for low-cost, flexible devices
in electronics. Developing substrates suitable for various printable
electronic inks becomes an important topic in both academia and industry.
Because of their extraordinary properties like solution processability,
colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are gradually emerging in this field
as promising candidates for electronic inks. In recent years, researchers
have successfully produced high quality PbS QD inks in polar solvents.
However, the incorporation of electronic inks onto a well-passivated
substrate remains challenging due to the processing incompatibility
between polar solvents and hydrophobic substrates. Here, we propose
a surface modification strategy by using chlorine to achieve both
trap-site suppression and a hydrophilic surface. The chlorine can
effectively passivate the surface dangling bonds and charged hydroxyls
while creating a hydrophilic surface. On this modified substrate,
the contact angle between the water droplet and the SiO2 substrate can be as small as 20° and this strategy is also
feasible for other polymer and inorganic substrates. For a proof-of-concept
demonstration, we fabricated a PbS QD ink-based field-effect transistor
on a Cl-passivated substrate, and the device showed a mobility as
high as 4.36 × 10–3 cm2/V s, which
indicates effective trap-site suppression. This device also enables
the potential of the Cl-passivated substrates for QD inks with water
or other polar solvents.

Introduction
Printed electronics
enables electronic and photonic devices to
be fabricated by printing-based technologies such as screen printing,
inkjet printing, roll-to-roll printing, and so on.1,2 As
an additive manufacturing technique, the printing technique can effectively
reduce costs by high volume manufacturing and less utilization of
complicated semiconductor manufacturing instruments (e.g., metal organic
chemical vapor deposition). Thanks to these advantages, the market
of printed electronics is fastly growing and it is predicted to reach
330 billion USD by 2027.3 Consequently,
researchers from both industry and academia are making efforts in
developing high-performance functional devices, from simple circuits4 to complex transistors5 and light-emitting devices,6 by the printing
technique. However, there are still challenges in this field, which
need to be conquered, such as seeking of high-performance electronic
inks and higher-resolution printing technologies,7,8 while
the substrate is another major consideration in printed electronics
and one needs to match the properties of the electronic ink with the
surface properties of the substrate. One of the most important properties
of the substrate surface is its hydrophobicity or the surface energy.
If the surface is more hydrophilic, the water-based ink tends to adhere
better to the surface. Plasma treatment is a popular method to create
a hydrophilic surface, which is brought about by dangling bonds and
hydroxyl groups. Other than hydrophobicity, the interface trap is
another important issue on the substrate surface in printing functional
electronic devices.9 Dangling bonds and
hydroxyls on the surface will form interface trap sites that will
affect the performance of printed electronic devices. Therefore, an
extra passivation strategy is needed to eliminate these trap sites.10 The use of self-assembled monolayers is a common
route to surface passivation. Usually, self-assembled monolayers are
long-chain, complex organic molecules, such as bis(trimethylsilyl)amine,11 octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), divinyltetramethyldisiloxane-bis(benzocyclobutene),
and polystyrene.12 However, these molecules
will create an extremely hydrophobic surface, which is a problem in
printing manufacturing.

Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are gradually
attracting the attention
of researchers, not only because of their extraordinary features such
as tunable absorption spectrum and narrow emission spectrum that make
them widely used in solar energy harvesting,13,14 light-emitting devices,15 and light sensing16 but also due to their solution processability
and amorphous nature that enable a lot of flexible electronic devices,
such as flexible touch sensors,17 flexible
gas sensors,18 and flexible logic circuits.19 The solution-processed QD-based devices also
have the potential to be mass-produced by printing methods. To fit
in this trend, solution-phased in situ ligand exchange is developed
to acquire QDs with short ligands.20 Among
different types of QDs, PbS colloidal QDs are one of the most promising
candidates because of their unique properties and multiexciton generation,
which makes PbS QDs gain a lot of attention in photonic applications,
such as photovoltaic devices21 and photodetectors.22 Previously, because of the existence of long
ligands, layer-by-layer deposition was demonstrated to be an effective
way to create high-quality, device-level PbS QD films.23 However, this deposition method heavily restricts
the application of printing PbS QD devices because it does not allow
the QD films to be deposited in one cast. Recently, phase-transfer
ligand exchange was introduced into fabricating PbS QD inks.24−26 Phase-transfer ligand exchange allows PbS QDs to obtain extremely
short ligands, such as halide atoms, in suspension conditions. Thus,
the ligand-exchanged QD suspension is able to form a high-quality
film in one cast. It is the QD ink that has the potential to be used
in printing instruments. However, the PbS QD ink is usually made using
a polar carrying solvent like N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) which does not allow the PbS QD ink to be
printed on well-passivated hydrophobic substrates. However, researchers
only developed ways to suppress the substrate trap sites by using
self-assembled monolayers with nonpolar head groups;27 the electronic-device-friendly, trap-free passivated hydrophilic
surface is still an obstacle for the PbS QD ink to be fully printed.

Here, we propose a new strategy to create a trap-free substrate
surface suitable for PbS QD ink by chlorine modification. Iodine atoms
were previously utilized to eliminate trap states at the heterojunction
interface to fabricate high-performance photonic devices.28 We extend it to halide modification for various
rigid and flexible substrate surfaces and apply Cl-modified SiO2 surfaces for high-performance QD field-effect transistors
(FETs). In this study, we first verified the successful passivation
of chlorine on the SiO2 surface using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The contact angle measurement further showed the
reduced contact angle between a droplet of DMF and the SiO2 substrate. Then, this modification method was extended to other
rigid and flexible substrates, such as Si and polyimide (Kapton films
from DuPont). Finally, PbS QD ink was utilized to make an FET with
a Cl-modified interface, which shows an obvious higher mobility than
the unmodified control device due to suppressed surface trap sites
by Cl-modification. The whole solution process shows the potential
of PbS QD inks to be introduced into printing manufacturing, which
will foster the development of QD materials for future printed electronics.

Results
and Discussion
The surface modification process is shown
in Figure 1a. The substrates
were treated by oxygen
plasma to acquire a surface that contains a lot of silicon dangling
bonds. Then, the substrate would be placed in a Petri dish that contains
OTS/toluene solution or NH4Cl/water solution for 30 min.
The detailed experimental procedures are described in the Experimental Section. By this simple solution surface
modification, passivated surfaces can be obtained. Normally, SiO2 surfaces have a large number of hydroxyls and Si dangling
bonds as shown in the top panel of Figure 1b. These surface groups can act as trap sites
that will trap charge carriers. Thus, the dangling bonds and hydroxyls
will affect carrier transport as indicated as trap states. So, the
passivated surface is an essential part in making a high-performance
electronic device. Either the modification molecule of OTS or the
chlorine as we proposed can eliminate hydroxyls and dangling bonds
as shown in the bottom panel in Figure 1b, which will make carrier transport more efficient.

Figure 1 (a) Illustration
of the surface passivation process. (b) Schematic
of the interface trap mechanism.

To verify that the chemical reactions in modification did
occur
on the surfaces, we carried out Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) and XPS on substrates with different modifications. From Figure 2a, it can be easily
seen that the bare SiO2 and Cl-modified substrate show
no abnormal absorption in the wavenumber range 2700–3200 cm–1. However, there are two absorption peaks observed
at 2849 and 2917 cm–1, which coincide with the results
of previously reported OTS absorption on the SiO2/Si substrate.29 Because the characteristic peaks of Cl cannot
be observed in the infrared range, XPS was utilized to confirm Cl
on the SiO2 substrate. It is shown in Figure 2b that the Cl 2p peak, which
has a similar binding-energy value to that in a previous report,30 can be seen in the right panel (the fitted red
dashed line), which represents the Cl-modified interface, whereas
the OTS-modified interface only shows noise. Energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) measurement (Figure S1) was also performed on a bare SiO2 substrate, which shows
no Cl characteristic peaks.

modifications. (b)
XPS results of the OTS-passivated surface and the Cl-passivated surface.
The red dashed line is fitted with the Cl 2p peak.

To investigate the processing compatibility of
Cl-modified surfaces
for PbS QD inks, we made contact angle measurement of water and DMF
(carrying solvent of PbS QD inks) on glass substrates. The OTS-modified
SiO2 substrate, a previously reported27 substrate for mobility measurement of PbS QD films, is
used as the control sample here. From the left panel of Figure 3, it can be seen that the contact
angles of water and DMF on OTS-modified substrates are 96 and 51°,
which may induce some problems in the printing process due to the
large contact angles. However, the Cl-modified surface can significantly
reduce these contact angles to 20 and 11°, respectively. The
small contact angles are in favor of printing PbS QDs in water and
DMF. We also performed experiments to investigate the stability of
the Cl-passivated substrates in ambient conditions. As shown in Figure S2, it can be clearly seen that after
1, 4, and 8 days, the water contact angles remain in a relatively
similar value, whereas the value of the DMF contact angle with the
substrate is slightly increasing. We attributed it to a small amount
of desorption of Cl atoms and this indicates that it is preferred
to fabricate devices on the substrate before 4 days after Cl treatment.
The Cl-modification strategy includes NH4Cl treatment but
not limited to it. Other chloride ion compounds (NaCl, 3 mg/mL; tetrabutylammonium
chloride (TBAC), 15 mg/mL) are also tested by the same treatment process.
As shown in Figure S3, NaCl and TBAC treatments
can achieve similar results to NH4Cl treatment. It can
be concluded that other chloride ion compounds can also achieve effective
substrate modification.

Figure 3 Contact angle measurement of water and DMF on
OTS-passivated and
Cl-passivated surfaces.

We further applied this surface modification strategy to
polyimide
(Kapton) and silicon substrates. The results of contact angle measurement
are shown in Figure 4. It is seen in the first row that Cl-modification will largely decrease
the water contact angle on the Kapton substrate, which makes it suitable
for aqueous inks. Because both Kapton and DMF have a similar structure,
the contact angle of DMF on the orginal Kapton substrate is already
small. Cl-modification will not make a big difference on it. The difference
between the values of modified and unmodified surfaces should be a
result of system error.

Figure 4 Contact angle measurement of solvents on chlorine-passivated
Kapton
and silicon substrates.

The contact angles on the silicon substrate is also shown
in Figure 4. Due to
the native
oxide (low-quality silicon oxide grown in ambient environment) on
top of the silicon substrate, the contact angles between water/DMF
and the silicon substrate are small. However, after Cl-modification,
the contact angles become smaller, which proved that the proposed
substrate modification strategy is more effective than the use of
a bare silicon substrate. More importantly, the proposed strategy
can effectively passivate silicon substrates using Cl-modification,
which is confirmed in the demonstration below. Considering that the
Cl-modification strategy is effective on the polymer substrate and
other silicon-based materials, we conclude that this strategy has
potential to act as a universal method to passivate various substrates
in printed electronics.

To characterize the interface traps,
we performed experiments to
examine the carrier decay dynamics. PbS QD films were deposited between
gold electrodes by the traditional layer-by-layer strategy.23 The detailed procedure of PbS QD synthesis is
in the Experimental Section. As shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information, the
first excitonic peak is observed at 1430 nm. The size of the quantum
dots is around 6 nm as shown in the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image in Figure S5. The device we
used in this testing has two terminals as shown in Figure S6. The detailed device fabrication procedure is shown
in the Experimental Section. The testing set-up
is shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting
Information. In the measurement, the device is driven by a function
generator. The current response of the quantum dot device is linearly
converted to a voltage signal by an LM741 operational amplifier with
a feedback loop. The output voltage signals are collected by an oscilloscope.
The function generator has the output voltage of the square waveform
and the device should respond in current signals of the square waveform.
However, the rising and falling edges are not as sharp as the original
signal from the function generator, as shown in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 (a) Voltage response of a quantum dot device
to a 100 Hz square
wave. (b) Zoom-in graphs of decay on the rise edge. Inset: curve-fitting
of different devices. (c) Fitting curves which show different decay
times.

According to previous reports,
the rising and falling edges of
measured currents can be explained from the trapping and detrapping
of charges in PbS quantum dot films and SiO2 interfaces.31,32 Therefore, the I–t curves
(transient responses) of devices can be expressed as multiple exponential
decays considering trapping dynamics: 1  

In eq 1, Vamp is the voltage generated
from the operational amplifier,
which is linearly proportional to the current (Ids) flowing through the device, whereas τi is related to the lifetimes of different types of
carrier traps. If the decay curve is on the rising edge, the operator
between I0 and ∑ should be minus
because it is a trapping process; Otherwise, the operator should be
plus because it is a detrapping process. Here, as shown in Figure 5b, the rising edge
is taken for analysis. We first used a 1 MΩ resistor (similar
resistance to the QD devices) to extract the RC charge time (τ1) of the measurement circuit. Then, the I–t curves of the 1 MΩ resistor, PbS QD device with the Cl-passivated
interface and PbS QD device with the SiO2 interface were
fitted to eq 1, as shown
in Figure 5c. The various
decay times (τi) of different samples
are shown in Table 1. In addition to τ1, the device with the Cl-passivated
interface shows another exponential component with a decay time of
5.29 ms and the device with the SiO2 interface shows two
more exponential components with decay times of 5.40 and 0.49 ms.
Since 5.29 and 5.40 ms are very close, we attributed them to the trapping
time inside PbS QD films and it may originate from charging the electronic
states on QD surfaces. Another decay time of 0.49 ms is only shown in
the device with the SiO2 interface, and we attributed it
to charging the interface traps on SiO2 substrates. Therefore,
we conclude that the Cl-passivation strategy can eliminate SiO2 interface trap states.

To verify
the potential of Cl-passivation as an effective way towards
hydrophilic, trap-free substrates, we fabricated PbS QD FETs with
different interfaces. The original PbS QDs are capped with long oleic
acid suspending in octane. To acquire PbS QD ink, the phase-transfer
ligand exchange procedure is followed. As shown in Figure 6a, before ligand exchange,
the PbS QDs were in nonpolar octane solvent. After agitation, the
PbS QDs were covered by iodide. Thus, they were transferred to the
bottom polar DMF solvent. The XPS spectrum in Figure S8 indicated the successful ligand exchange by observing
the I 3d peaks in CQDs. Finally, the QD FETs were fabricated as the
steps described in the Experimental Section. The device schematic is shown in Figure 6b. In the FET device, bottom highly doped
silicon can act as a gate, whereas the source and drain gold electrodes
are made by sputtering. The channel width between the source and drain
electrodes is 5 μm. The PbS QD film is deposited on the substrate
by an one-time spin-coating of QD inks. The Ids–Vds curves are shown
in Figure S9, whereas the transfer curves
of these FETs are shown in Figure 6c. The gate currents were also monitored to rule out
the gate leakage in FET devices. As shown in Figure S10, the gate current is within noises floating around zero
and is several orders of magnitude smaller than the channel current
(Ids) at any given voltage (Vgs). The log-scaled transfer curves are also plotted as
shown in Figure S11. The hole mobilities
of QD films are retrieved from the transfer curves. The detailed calculation
method is shown in the Supporting Information. The transconductance is calculated from the dashed tangent lines.
By testing multiple devices, the mobilities of plasma-treated FET
and Cl-modified FET can be averaged as 2.75 ± 1.16 × 10–3 and 4.36 ± 0.93 × 10–3 cm2/V s, respectively. The histograms are shown in the
Supporting Information as Figure S12. We
attributed the low mobility of the plasma-treated FET to trap sites
on the plasma-treated SiO2 surface. The Cl-modified FET
showed a large mobility, 60% larger than the plasma-treated one, because
Cl can effectively passivate the surface trap sites. We also tried
to fabricate a PbS QD ink FET on an OTS-modified substrate. However,
we cannot retrieve any reliable data out of it, due to the poor film
quality on the OTS-modified surface as shown in Figure S13. From this figure, we can see that almost nothing
was left after PbS QD ink spin-coating. This agrees with the large
contact angle between QD ink and the OTS-modified surface.

Conclusions
In this work, we showed a Cl-modification strategy
to passivate
rigid and flexible substrates for printed electronics. This method
can create polar-solvent friendly surfaces on various polymer and
inorganic substrates. FTIR and XPS were utilized to verify the passivation.
Surface hydrophobicity is characterized by contact angle measurement.
Then, carrier dynamic analysis was performed to verify the elimination
of surface traps. Finally, we fabricated PbS QD ink-based FETs on
Cl-modified substrates. They showed much higher mobilities in PbS
QD films on Cl-modified substrates than the values extracted from
QD films on plasma-treated substrates and OTS-modified substrates
due to effective suppression of surface trap sites by Cl-modification.
It can be concluded that Cl-modification can suppress the surface
trap sites while creating a hydrophilic surface, showing its potential
to be applied in printing techniques.

Experimental Section
Materials
Lead acetate (PbAc), n-octane,
ammonium acetate (NH4Ac), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Fisher Scientific
Inc. Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), 1-octadecene (ODE), oleic
acid, hexamethyldisilathiane (TMS2-S), tetrabutylammonium iodide,
and lead iodide (PbI2) are all acquired from Sigma-Aldrich
Inc. The polyimide (Kapton, 5 mil) films we used in contact angle
testing were purchased from DuPont Inc. (Delaware). All of the silicon
and oxide wafers utilized in the experiments were from University
Wafer Inc. (Boston, MA).

Chlorine Modification
All substrate
surfaces were activated
by oxygen plasma (ICP-RIE, Alcatel) first. After surface activation,
the substrates were immediately transferred into an NH4Cl solution with a concentration of 3 mg/mL. After 30 min, the substrates
were taken out and washed with water and ethanol.

Characterization
The absorption spectrum of QDs was
acquired on a PerkinElmer NIR-UV spectrophotometer. A Nicolet 8700
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was utilized to obtain the
infrared absorption spectra, whereas X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
was performed on a Kratos AXIS 165 system. The contact angle measurement
was performed on an FTA-200 system and the field-effect transistor
measurement was done by using a Wentworth probe station and Keithley
2400 soucemeter.

Quantum Dot Synthesis
The synthesis
process can be
referred to in our previous publication.17 The colloidal lead sulfide quantum dots were synthesized by using
a classic two-step hot-injection method. For this, 570 mg of PbAc
and 1.05 mL of oleic acid were dissolved in 15 mL of ODE at 100 °C
in a three-neck flask with a vacuum environment. After 8 h of heating
and stirring, the lead oleate precursor would be formed. The vacuum
environment was then switched to a nitrogen environment quickly by
a Schlenk line. The flask was then heated up to 160 °C. After
the above steps, another reactant, TMS2-S (160 μL), was prepared
by mixing with 7.5 mL of ODE. The reactant solvent was injected quickly
to the reaction flask by a syringe. Then, the flask was immediately
removed out of the heating mantle to cool down while continuously
stirring. When the temperature of the product cooled down to room
temperature, it was transferred to centrifuge tubes and washed with
acetone two times. Finally, the product was dried in a vacuum and
redispersed in octane at a concentration of 50 mg/mL.

TEM and EDX
Characterization
TEM images were taken
using a JEOL JEM-ARM200CF S/TEM system. To prepare the samples, we
diluted the PbS QD suspension in octane to approximately 2 mg/mL and
ultrasonicated for 10 min. The diluted suspension was then added dropwise
onto a copper grid. After being dried overnight at ambient conditions,
the samples were ready for imaging.

The EDX data were acquired
by an Oxford EDX on a Zeiss EVO M10 SEM. The samples used were surface-modified
quartz glass.

Fabrication of Samples for Carrier Decay
Dynamic Analysis
The two-terminal device is fabricated on
a borosilicate glass.
A conventional lift-off photolithography process was utilized to create
electrodes on top. At first, an HMDS hydrophobic monolayer was assembled
on top of the silicon oxide layer by an YES HMDS oven. A HPR-504 photoresist
layer was then created by spin-coating. The spread step is performed
at 500 rpm for 10 s, whereas the spin step is conducted at 4000 rpm,
which will last for 40 s. After spin-coating, the wafer was then transferred
onto a hotplate for soft-baking (90 s @ 115 °C) to evaporate
all solvents. The exposure step was conducted on a mask aligner from
ABM Inc. (San Jose, CA). The exposure time is 3 s with an intensity
of 66.7 mW/cm2 at 365/405 nm. Developer 354 was then applied
to develop photoresist patterns for 45 s with agitation. The electrode
deposition (5 nm of chromium as the adhesion layer and 65 nm of gold)
was performed on a home-made sputtering system. Finally, the wafer
was soaked in acetone to lift off extra gold.

Before deposition
of the CQD film, the substrate was treated by oxygen plasma to remove
all HDMS molecules. It was then modified by chlorine as shown in the
previous step. The control device is fabricated on an OTS-modified
substrate. The substrate was treated in 1% (v/v) OTS solution for
2 h.

The CQD film deposition was done by a traditional layer-by-layer
strategy as described in a previous report.23 The original CQD suspension (50 mg/mL) was diluted to 16.7 mg/mL
in octane. Each layer iteration included three substeps: (1) three
drops of lead sulfide quantum dot (QD) suspension was applied on the
surface and spun (2500 rpm) for 10 s; (2) 0.25 mL of ammonium chloride
(NH4Cl, Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) solution in methanol was added
dropwise on the CQD film and remained there for 5 s and then spun
for 10 s to flush the solution away; (3) methanol was employed to
wash the CQD film finally. We let the methanol remain on the film
for 10 s and then spun it away. This washing step should be repeated
two times.

Phase-Transfer Ligand Exchange
To
enable biphasic ligand
exchange, 0.235 g of PbI2 and 0.015 g of NH4Ac were dissolved in 5 mL of DMF. Then, 5 mL of PbS QD suspension
(10 mg/mL, in octane) was added. After 1 min shaking by hand and centrifuging,
the PbS QDs were transferred from the octane phase to the DMF phase.
The octane should be removed by a pipette. New octane was added and
mixed by a vortex mixer to wash out the residual oleic acid. After
that, the product was centrifuged to separate the octane. This washing
iteration should be repeated three times. After these steps, 5 mL
of toluene was added to precipitate the PbS QDs. The supernatant was
then poured out and the QDs were dried in a vacuum for 20 min. Finally,
the QDs were redispersed in DMF.

Field-Effect Transistor
Fabrication
The FET devices
were based on a silicon oxide wafer with highly doped degenerated
silicon, which can act as a back gate. At first, backside silicon
oxide was etched off by inductively coupled plasma plasma etching.
The fabrication process is exactly the same as in the fabrication
of samples for carrier decay dynamic analysis.

The substrate
was then treated by oxygen plasma to remove all HDMS molecules. It
was then modified by chlorine as shown in the previous step. Since
the CQD ink can form a highly coupled film by a single cast, the traditional
layer-by-layer deposition can be abandoned. Three drops of CQD ink
were casted on the top of the substrate. Then, it was spun for 1 min
at 2500 rpm. Finally, the device is baked at 150 °C for 30 min
to evaporate all residual solvents and accomplish a highly coupled
thin film.
