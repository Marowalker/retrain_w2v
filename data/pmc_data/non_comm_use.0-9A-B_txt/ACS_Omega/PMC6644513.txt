Water-soluble azobenzene derivatives
containing amino[bis(ethanesulfonate)] groups are
demonstrated as colorful pH indicators
in water and on filter paper. Vibrant color changes were observed
from yellow/orange to pink between pH 1 and 4, which are attributed
to an intramolecular charge-transfer mechanism. The pKas of the indicators range from 2.1 to 2.6. 1H/1H–15N NMR studies in deuterium oxide
reveal that the protonation of the azobenzene pH indicators occurs
predominantly at the β-azo nitrogen atom, in agreement with
the density functional theory calculations. Excellent selectivity
for protons was confirmed in water over common biologically relevant
metal ions. Studies in methanol, however, indicate that the pH indicator
with a methoxy group ortho to the amino[bis(ethanesulfonate)] group facilitates the selective coordination of
Cu2+ with a binding constant pβCu2+ of
4.6 ± 0.1. The indicators complement the existing library of
azobenzene indicator dyes and may be useful for measuring the environmental
pH at higher proton concentrations.

Introduction
Azobenzenes are a class
of compound used as dyes for textiles,
foods, soaps, and cosmetics, among many industrial uses.1,2 Their relative ease of synthesis and photocontrollable cis/trans isomerization3,4 make them useful components in
smart materials,5,6 metal–organic frameworks
(MOFs),7,8 self-assembled monolayers,9,10 nonlinear optical materials,11 and supramolecular
devices.12−16 Azobenzenes are also a classic scaffold for pH indicators and metal
ion chemosensors.17−24 In fact, the chromophore represents the largest percentage of commercially
available pH indicators.2 However, a majority
of colorimetric azobenzene-based indicators and chemosensors are not
so readily soluble in water and require an organic co-solvent.25−30 Development of 100% water-soluble azobenzene indicators is thus
most desirable. Furthermore, considering the abundance of azobenzene
pH indicators, the choices are rather limited in the lower pH region.
Previously, we reported the synthesis of a series of amino[bis(ethanesulfonate)] azobenzene pH indicators 3–5 with brilliant color changes and ideal water solubility properties
(Figure 1).31

Figure 1 Molecules discussed in this study: model compounds 1 and 2, the azobenzene pH indicators 3–5, and methyl yellow.

The motivation of this present study was to investigate the
mechanism
of protonation of these remarkable amino[bis(ethanesulfonate)]
azobenzene pH indicators in water. Aminoazobenzenes have been the
subject of numerous studies by UV–vis absorption, 1H NMR, and Raman spectroscopy over the past decades.27−30,32 A common challenge has been to
determine which of the two nitrogen atoms is preferentially protonated:
the p-hybridized atom (Nγ) or the s-hybridized atom (Nβ) (Scheme 1). Pioneering work relied solely on UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy for determining the tautomeric equilibrium.33−35 More recent studies have relied on other spectroscopy techniques
such as 1H NMR and Raman, the majority of which were performed
in organic solvents. However, the properties of aprotic solvents such
as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and acetonitrile are significantly different
than those of water. Hence, an objective was to gain direct insight
into the protonation equilibrium of aminoazobenzene analogues in aqueous
solution. We hypothesized that two-dimensional (2D) 1H–15N NMR techniques (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation
(HMBC) and Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation (HSQC)) and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations could be used to delineate the
protonation equilibria in water.36−41

Scheme 1 Generalized Protonation Mechanism for Aminoazobenzenes in Acidic
Solution1
Herein, we report the physiochemical properties of the
three water-soluble
azobenzene pH indicators 3–5 (Figure 1). The indicators are water
soluble on the account of the presence of two ethanesulfonate groups
attached to the amino nitrogen atom.31,42,43 Using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, we thoroughly
characterize the acid–base properties of the indicators and
compare them to the model compounds 1 and 2 and methyl yellow (Figure 1); using 1H–15N NMR spectroscopy
and DFT calculations, we provide insight into the sites of protonation.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines
the tautomeric equilibrium of azobenzene derivatives exclusively in
water using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with
2D-NMR spectroscopic techniques and DFT calculations.

Results and Discussion
The azobenzenes 3–5, shown in Figure 1, were synthesized as reported
in a preliminary study.31 The alkylation
of aniline and 2-methoxyaniline with sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate
gave 1 and 2, which were further reacted
with aniline or 4-nitroaniline via a diazonium coupling reaction.
The products were characterized in detail by 1H/13C/15N NMR, IR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
(refer to SI). The intermediates 1 and 2 were fully characterized as part of a
separate study and included as model reference compounds.42

The azobenzenes 3–5 exhibit pH- and concentration-dependent
color changes in water. Figure 2 shows the color changes of 3–5 over a
range of concentrations (1 mM, 0.1 mM, and 10 μM). At 10 μM,
the solutions of 3–5 are pinkish at pH 1.0 corresponding
to a monoprotonated species. At pH 4.0, the solution of unprotonated 3 is yellow, whereas the solutions of 4 and 5 are orange. The color changes are attributed to an internal
charge transfer mechanism resulting from the push–pull effect
of the electron-donating amine and the electron-withdrawing nitro
substituent.11 At 0.1 mM, the protonated
indicators exhibit red solutions at pH 1.0, whereas unprotonated 3–5 are yellow, red, and reddish-orange, respectively,
at pH 4.0. Azobenzene 3 exhibits the broadest usable
concentration range as a pH indicator between 1 μM and 1 mM,
whereas 4 and 5 are most vibrant at a concentration
of 10 μM.

Figure 2 Azobenzene compounds 3–5 and methyl
yellow
at pH 1.0 (left beaker) and pH 4.0 (right beaker) in water. Methyl
yellow was demonstrated in 1:4 (v/v) methanol/water due to the limited
aqueous solubility. Adapted from ref (31).

The commercially available pH indicator methyl yellow (N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene) was also examined at the
same concentrations, for comparison, as shown in Figure 2. The observed color changes
of methyl yellow resemble those of 3. Methyl yellow was
studied in 1:3 (v/v) MeOH/H2O to ensure adequate solubility.
The two sulfonate moieties within azobenzenes 3–5 allow for solubility in water at 10 mM concentrations. These observations
are in agreement with the calculated octanol–water distribution
coefficients (log P). The log P of methyl yellow is predicted to be 4.43. By contrast, the indicators 3–5 are soluble in water, in relatively good agreement
with the calculated log P values of 0.21,
0.60, and 0.61, respectively.

UV–Vis Absorption Spectrophotometric
Studies
The sulfonated compounds 1 and 2 and the
azobenzenes 3–5 were thoroughly investigated as
a function of pH and concentration by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy.31,42 The UV–vis absorption spectra of 3–5 as
a function of pH are shown in Figure 3. A summary of the spectroscopic parameters can be
found in Table 1. Compounds 1 and 2 absorb below 300 nm and hence do not
exhibit any color changes in water on titration with acid, whereas
the azobenzenes 3–5 display bands extending into
the visible region.

acid (HEPES) buffer). Good linearity was observed with R2 > 0.997.

Azobenzene 3 exhibits
broad absorption bands at 264
nm (log ε = 4.49) and 425 nm (log ε = 4.23)
at neutral and basic pH conditions. Below pH 4, these peaks decrease
incrementally with the concomitant formation of a strong absorption
peak at 529 nm (log ε = 4.62). These changes correspond
to a sigmoidal titration profile over two pH units between pH 1 and
3 with an isosbestic point at 469 nm.31

Similarly, 4 displays a strong intramolecular
charge
transfer band, but at a longer wavelength of 481 nm (log ε
= 4.12) in neutral and basic conditions due to the nitro group in
the para position to the azobenzene moiety. A weak absorption band
is also present at 264 nm (log ε = 3.78). On the addition
of acid up to pH 1, a new band with absorption peaks at 530 nm (log ε
= 4.35) and 547 nm (log ε = 4.35) results at the expense
of the broad peak at 481 nm. An isosbestic point is observed at 484
nm. The weak band at 280 nm decreases in intensity (log ε
= 3.52) as a new band appears at 346 nm.

Azobenzene 5 with the methoxy group exhibits a significantly
different spectral output. The absorption bands are observed at 269
nm (log ε = 4.30) and 436 nm (log ε = 4.07)
at basic and neutral conditions. These bands decrease in intensity
at greater than 10–4 M acid with the formation of
new bands at 323 nm (log ε = 4.15) and 515 nm (log ε
= 3.87). Three isosbestic points are observed at 299 nm, 365 nm, and
529 nm, as illustrated in Figure 3.

pH titrations were also performed with methyl
yellow (4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene)
(Figures S1 and S2). Under alkaline and
neutral conditions, methyl yellow displays peaks at 260 nm (log ε
= 3.81) and 450 nm (log ε = 4.20). On the addition of
acid, both these peaks decrease and are eventually replaced with maxima
at 320 nm and 514 nm (log ε = 4.40). Isosbestic points
appear at 348 nm and 474 nm. The longer wavelength band ca. 530 nm
is assigned to protonation at the Nβ, whereas the band appearing
at around 320–346 nm is due to protonation at Nγ.34 The extension of this interpretation to 3 would suggest that preferential protonation occurs at the
Nβ, whereas there is an equilibrium between the ammonium and
azonium form in aqueous solution in the case of 4 and 5. The shorter wavelength band was much more prominent with 5 than with 4, implying that the equilibrium
is shifted toward the azonium form in the case of 4.
However, the UV–vis absorption data alone does not provide
conclusive evidence. Hence, further insight into the protonation equilibria
was obtained by 2D 1H–15N NMR spectroscopy
and DFT calculations (vide infra).

The practical application
of 3–5 as pH test
strips was examined by immersing 1 cm × 5 cm strips of filter
paper in 0.1 M solutions of the respective indicator.44 The addition of alkali solution onto the test strips results
in yellow, brown-orange, and pink-violet colors for 3–5, respectively. The tests strips changed color to pink in all three
cases on the addition of acid (Figure 4). The results demonstrate the applicability of these
azobenzene compounds as practical colorimetric pH indicators.

of 3–5 (left to right) adsorbed
on filter paper. The test strips on the left of each pair are treated
with 0.01 M NaOH solution and the test strips on the right are treated
with 0.01 M HCl.

1H NMR Titration
Studies
The NMR spectra
of compounds 1–5 were recorded in D2O. In the case of 5, the peaks were broad and unresolved,
possibly due to aggregation. Hence, the NMR spectra of 5 were subsequently recorded in DMSO-d6 or mixed aqueous DMSO-d6. The proton
signals were assigned based on one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments
including 1H–13C HMBC and 1H–13C HSQC spectra (see Supporting Information for the spectra). 1H–15N HMBC correlation spectroscopy was also performed to determine the
absolute assignment of the nitrogen atoms (vide infra).45−47

Figure 5 illustrates
the 1H NMR spectra of 4 as a function of the
increasing amount of dilute hydrochloric acid. At pD 10.1, the 1H NMR spectrum of 4 exhibits two broad signals
at δH 3.26 ppm and 3.89 ppm corresponding to the
ethanesulfonate protons, and three doublets in the aromatic region
at δH 6.82 ppm, 7.70 ppm, and 8.22 ppm. On an incremental
addition of the acid, all of the proton signals are observed to undergo
a downfield chemical shift. A chemical shift change (ΔδH) of 0.5 ppm is observed for the aromatic H4 and H8 atoms
nearest the amino group, initially at 6.82 ppm at pD 10.1, whereas
a much smaller change of ΔδH ≤ 0.1 ppm
is observed for the aromatic proton signals about the azo moiety and
the more upfield ethylene protons adjacent to the sulfonates. Most
notably, the doublet at 7.70 ppm resolves into two distinct peaks
at pD 1.3.

Figure 5 1H NMR spectra of 4 in D2O as
a function of added DCl.

Similar ΔδH are observed on titrating 3 with acid in D2O, although the chemical shift
changes are not as dramatic as for 4. No resonance shifts
greater than 0.1 ppm are observed. However, 5 exhibits
a striking ΔδH near the amino group, similar
to 3, with the chemical shift changes up to 0.6 ppm.
Due to limited solubility, the titration experiments of 5 had to be measured in a mixture of 1:1 or 4:1 (v/v) DMSO-d6/D2O. Methyl yellow also exhibited
a large ΔδH of 0.5 ppm for the aromatic hydrogen
atoms adjacent to the amino nitrogen in 4:1 (v/v) DMSO-d6/D2O. A histogram of the 1H NMR
chemical shift data for compounds 3–5 and methyl
yellow as a function of pD is given in Figure 6.

DMSO-d6/D2O on titration from
pD 10.1 to 1.3. Methyl yellow was measured in 4:1 (v/v) DMSO-d6/D2O.

1H–15N NMR Titration Studies
1H–15N gHMBC spectra of 3–5 and methyl yellow were obtained at pD 1 and pD 4 to gain insight
into the site of nitrogen protonation in water (Table 2). 1H–15N gHMBC
spectra of 3 are shown overlaid in Figure 7. Three nitrogen atom resonances are observed
at pD 4. The large chemical shift changes observed on protonation
are indicative of a significant redistribution of the electron density.
Protonation of 3 yields a remarkable upfield chemical
shift of 216 ppm for the azonium nitrogen atom Nβ, with a concomitant
downfield shift of 45 ppm for the ammonium nitrogen atom Nγ.
These chemical shifts can be rationalized by the predominant formation
of the quinoid tautomer because protonation at the β-azo nitrogen
atom results in a decrease in the N–N bond order and an increase
in the C–N bond order at the ammonium nitrogen atom Nγ.27 The α-azo nitrogen atom Nα also
undergoes a noticeable upfield shift of 79 ppm. These results are
in agreement with the previous studies that there is preferentially
protonation at the β-azo nitrogen atom.28 By comparison, the chemical shifts of methyl yellow in DMSO-d6 are the same in direction, but less in magnitude.

Figure 7 1H–15N HMBC overlaid the spectra of 3 in D2O. The red spots correspond to the 15N chemical shifts at pD 4 and the green spots those at pD
1. Substantial nitrogen chemical shifts of 44 ppm, 79 ppm, and 216
ppm are observed for nitrogen atoms Nγ, Nα, and Nβ,
respectively.

Compound 4 exhibits

and the additional resonance due to the nitro moiety appears at 370
ppm independent of the acid concentration between pD 1 and 4. Furthermore,
the α-azo nitrogen atom Nα undergoes an upfield shift
of 39 ppm, whereas a downfield shift of 52 ppm was observed for the
ammonium nitrogen atom Nγ. Obtaining a complete set of resonances
for 5 proved difficult even in the presence of Cr3+, which was added as a relaxant. The ΔδN for 3 and 4 are quite significant for
the β-azo nitrogen atom, with shifts of 216 nm and 243 ppm.
The 15N NMR results suggest that the protonation of 3 and 4 takes place predominantly at the β-azo
nitrogen atom.

DFT Studies
DFT calculations were
performed on 3–5 and methyl yellow at the b3lyp/6–31+g(d,p)
level of theory (Figure 8).48 The calculations were initially done
in vacuum and with the sulfonate moieties protonated to achieve neutral
molecules, thereby simplifying the analysis. Frontier molecular orbitals
with the dianion species provide a more complex frontier orbital depiction
as the charged sulfonate groups occupy a series of higher occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. The HOMO-1 molecular orbitals, which
describe the charge density of the lone electron pairs, are delocalized
equally over the two central nitrogen atoms in all of the four cases,
although it was not possible to differentiate which of the two diaza
nitrogen atoms is the preferred site for protonation. The geometry
of 5 has the aromatic plane perpendicular to the plane
of the sulfonate groups, which is caused by a steric effect due to
the close proximity of the methoxy substituent. Molecules 3 and 4 have a quasi-planar geometry.

Figure 8 Distributions of the
electrostatic potential and contours of HOMO-1
molecular orbitals for methyl yellow and three indicators (devoid
of sulfonate groups) as calculated at the b3lyp/6–31++g(d,p)
level of theory with the iefpcm solvation model included. Numbers
indicate the Mullikan charges of the nitrogen atoms within the diazo
functionality.

A further simplification
was to consider the ethyl derivative of 3–5 devoid
of the sulfonate groups. This approach simplifies
the molecular charge analysis without affecting the electronic structure
significantly. It was revealed that the lone pairs are almost equally
distributed among the diaza nitrogen atoms, Nα and Nβ.
However, in most cases, the middle nitrogen atom bears a slightly
higher negative charge, except for the methoxy derivative 5, in which the terminal nitrogen bears the highest negative charge.
In vacuum or less polar solvents, the charge distribution within the
diazo group depends on the local environment, which makes the unambiguous
determination of the primary protonation site impossible. Furthermore,
another pocket of negative charge at the methoxy and diethylamine
sites supports copper binding as evident by a significant lone pair
character in the HOMO orbital. The electrostatic and frontier orbital
analysis were not fully conclusive in elucidation of the primary protonation
site. Therefore, geometries and formation energies of all of the possible
protonation isomers were calculated. These calculations clearly indicate
that the terminal nitrogen atom of the diazo group is the favored
protonation site. The differences in the total energies for the three
protonated isomers is ca. 46 and 65 kJ mol–1 between
the amino and middle nitrogen atoms, and the amino and terminal one,
respectively. The difference between the two diaza nitrogen atoms,
although not dramatic at 19 kJ mol–1, clearly indicates
a preference for protonation at the terminal nitrogen atom, Nβ.

Finally, the calculations for the sulfonated compounds were performed
in water. The results are similar to those in vacuum. The protonation
preferentially takes places at the Nβ nitrogen atom. The average
energy difference for protonation at the Nβ atom versus
protonation at the Nγ atom is 28 kJ mol–1 for 5 and methyl yellow, and 63 kJ mol–1 for 3 and 4. By comparison, the energy difference
between the Nα and Nβ nitrogen atoms is definitely smaller
but still significant at 20–28 kJ mol–1.
The indicators 4 and 5 with the nitro substituent
have the largest energy difference of 28 kJ mol–1, whereas 3 and methyl yellow have the difference of
20 kJ mol–1. Hence, the DFT calculations are in
excellent agreement with the 1H–15N NMR
spectroscopic studies. The thermodynamic calculations suggest that
the protonation at Nβ yields the most stable forms. However,
we cannot rule out that both nitrogen atoms may be involved in protonation,
as they share common electron density clouds.

Metal-Binding Properties
The selectivity of 3–5 for a range of common
metal ions in water was investigated in 20
mM HEPES buffered aqueous solution at a constant pH of 7.0 to avoid
interference from protons. No significant color or UV–vis spectra
changes were apparent on the addition of 0.2 mM Na+, K+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Hg2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, and Ce3+ added as chloride, perchlorate, or
nitrate salts. These results confirm the inherent selectivity of the
designed colorimetric indicators for H+ in water.

Nonetheless, we did explore the coordination susceptibility of the
azobenzene compounds with metal ions in methanol. We observed that
the addition of 0.5 mM Cu2+ (1 equiv) to a solution of 5  gave rise to a bathochromic shift from 284 nm to 294
nm, with a slight increase in the intensity and a decrease in the
band at 461 nm with an isosbestic point at 388 nm (Figure 9). A plot of the absorbance
versus the pCu2+ in methanol at 461 nm yields a sigmoidal
shaped curve over two log units. Fitting of the data provides a binding
constant of pβCu2+ of 4.6 ± 0.1 (Figure S3). An analogous Cu2+-sensitive
iminodiacetate azobenzene chemosensor reported by Gunnlaugsson exhibited
a pβCu2+ of 5.0 ± 0.1 in HEPES buffer at pH
7.20 In both cases, the ortho-methoxy group is essential for Cu2+ coordination. By
contrast, the addition of an equal amount of Cu2+ to 4, which is devoid of the ortho-methoxy substituent, showed
no significant changes in the UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure S4). In a previous study, a Job’s
plot analysis on the model compound 2 confirmed a 1:1
binding stoichiometry between Cu2+ and 2 in
methanol.42

Figure 9 UV–vis absorption
spectra of 5 in methanol
on the addition of up to 0.5 mM Cu2+. No change was observed
in the aqueous solution.

NMR titrations with 4 mM of 5 with 0.2 equiv
of Cu2+ were performed in 2:1 (v/v) CD3OD/D2O. On addition of Cu2+, the 1H NMR spectrum
of 5 broadens as expected due to the paramagnetic nature
of Cu2+ (Figure 10). Peak broadening is most extensive near the aliphatic region
of the spectra, particularly the resonance of the methoxy group at 4.05
ppm. The resonances of the protons nearest the sulfonates are also
significantly broadened. The protons on the aromatic ring next to
the amino nitrogen bearing the sulfonate groups are only slightly
broadened, whereas the protons on the aromatic ring with the nitro
group are much less affected. These findings give further confirmation
that Cu2+ complexation occurs at the o-methoxy amino [bis(ethanesulfonate)] moiety.

and (b) the aromatic region from 7.4 ppm to 8.5 ppm.

Conclusions
In comparison to many
commonly used azobenzene indicators, including
methyl yellow, the azobenzene derivatives demonstrated here are readily
soluble in 100% water up to millimolar concentrations. Selectivity
studies in water confirm they function as pH indicators without interference
from common biologically relevant metal ions. No evidence for coordination
to the sulfonate groups is observed in water. Interpretation of the
UV–vis absorption spectra suggests that protonation is principally
at the terminal β-azo nitrogen atom, which is corroborated by
in-depth 1H–15N 2D-NMR and DFT studies.
Investigations in methanol provide evidence for the selective detection
of Cu2+ (in addition to H+) due to the coordination
between the Nγ amino and the methoxy substituents as supported
by the proton NMR titration studies. Furthermore, we demonstrated
the practical utility of these azobenzene pH indicators on filter
paper. We anticipate that these colorimetric azobenzene pH indicators
will find many industrial applications in aqueous environments.
