Pt-loaded anatase
TiO2 (Pt/TiO2-A) was found
to be a highly active and stable catalyst for SO3 decomposition
at moderate temperatures (∼600 °C), which will prove to
be the key for solar thermochemical water-splitting processes used
to produce H2. The catalytic activity of Pt/TiO2-A was found to be markedly superior to that of a Pt catalyst supported
on rutile TiO2 (Pt/TiO2-R), which has been extensively
studied at a higher reaction temperature range (≥800 °C);
this superior activity was found despite the two being tested with
similar surface areas and metal dispersions after the catalytic reactions.
The higher activity of Pt on anatase is in accordance with the abundance
of metallic Pt (Pt0) found for this catalyst, which favors
the dissociative adsorption of SO3 and the fast removal
of the products (SO2 and O2) from the surface.
Conversely, Pt was easily oxidized to the much less active PtO2 (Pt4+), with the strong interactions between the
oxide and rutile TiO2 forming a fully coherent interface
that limited the active sites. A long-term stability test of Pt/TiO2-A conducted for 1000 h at 600 °C demonstrated that there
was no indication of noticeable deactivation (activity loss ≤
4%) over the time period; this was because the phase transformation
from anatase to rutile was completely prevented. The small amount
of deactivation that occurred was due to the sintering of Pt and TiO2 and the loss of Pt under the harsh reaction atmosphere.

Introduction
Thermochemical water-splitting
cycles that use concentrated solar
radiation as a heat source are promising large-scale and cost-effective
solar hydrogen production methods. One such production method is the
sulfur–iodine process, which is a cycle system consisting of
the following three reactions1−5 1   2   3  

The final step of reaction 1 involves the
decomposition of SO3 into SO2 + 1/2O2; this decomposition requires very high temperatures (≥800
°C), and that is why the sulfur–iodine process was originally
designed to be combined with nuclear heat sources. For this reaction
to instead use a heat fluid (≤650 °C) supplied by solar
collectors, active and stable SO3 decomposition catalysts
that work at moderate temperatures need to be developed. Pt-based
catalysts are considered to be the most promising candidates for this
temperature range,2,6 but most previous studies have
focused on how they work at high temperatures (≥800 °C),7−21 as this is where Pt-based catalysts typically start to deactivate.
The primary mechanism for this deactivation is sintering and the loss
of Pt in the corrosive reaction environment. Choosing the correct
support material for a Pt catalyst is, therefore, important in ensuring
its activity and stability. Pt catalysts supported on metal oxides
such as Al2O3 and ZrO2 are active,
but their stabilities are lower than those of Pt catalysts supported
on TiO2,11 which is unable to
react with SO3 to form sulfates. Although nonoxide supports
such as BaSO4 and SiC have also been reported,14,16 it is unclear whether they would be superior to TiO2 as
support materials for Pt catalysts. Previous studies on SO3 decompositions over Pt/TiO2 have focused only on the
rutile phase,10,12 which is thermodynamically stable
at high reaction temperatures of ∼800 °C. Because the
temperature range of the solar collector heat sources that are desired
for use is ≤650 °C, it would seem that the metastable
anatase phase could potentially be used as a support for Pt catalysts.
To the best of our knowledge, however, the combinations between Pt
and anatase TiO2 have not yet been studied in detail for
their applications in the decomposition of SO3. We recently
reported on a series of SiO2-supported metal vanadate catalysts
whose activities at 600–700 °C were at least equal to
those of conventional Pt catalysts.22−26 Developing Pt catalysts that have efficient activities
in moderate temperature ranges could prove useful, as they could act
as reference points for the new classes of candidate catalysts that
are being developed.

In the present paper, we report that a
Pt catalyst supported on
anatase TiO2 is much more active and stable for a SO3 decomposition reaction at ≤650 °C than a Pt catalyst
supported on rutile TiO2. To determine what effects the
two support materials had on the catalyst, we characterized the interactions
between Pt and TiO2 using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron microscopy, and a gas adsorption
technique. Furthermore, the stability of the Pt catalyst supported
on anatase TiO2 was tested for a total of 1000 h of the
SO3 decomposition reaction at 600 °C. The as-demonstrated
stability of the metallic Pt species against oxidation and that of
anatase against the phase transformation to rutile under the reaction
atmosphere are discussed in this paper in terms of metal–support
interactions.

Results
SO3 Decomposition
Activity of Pt/TiO2-A
and Pt/TiO2-R
The catalytic SO3 decomposition
was conducted first at 600 °C and then at 650 °C for 6 h
each so that the activity and stability of the Pt catalysts supported
on TiO2-A, TiO2-R, γ-Al2O3, and SiO2 could be compared. Table 1 summarizes the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area (SBET) and metal dispersion
(DPt) of these catalysts both before and
after the activity tests along with the results of their exposure
to two different gas streams (N2 or 18 vol % H2O/N2) under the same thermal conditions. Figure 1 shows the SO3 conversion
at 600 °C as a function of time on stream. γ-Al2O3 was found to exhibit the greatest Pt dispersion (DPt = 64%), whereas its SO3 conversion
was the lowest and most unstable; its instability in the presence
of SO3 led to a quick formation of Al2(SO4)3 overlayers; and these overlayers blocked the
access to the active Pt site. Although a similar phenomenon was reported
when Pt/Al2O3 was exposed to H2O/SO3 mixtures at temperatures above 800 °C,20 the sulfate formation should be more favorable as the temperature
decreases. This is the reason why Al2O3 cannot
be used as a support for SO3 decomposition catalysts in
the moderate temperature range. Unlike Al2O3, SiO2 is thermodynamically stable against sulfation.
Because of the high SBET and DPt values obtained for Pt/SiO2 (289 m2 g–1 and 24%, respectively) (Table 1), this supported catalyst showed a high
initial activity; however, this activity soon declined with the time
on stream (Figure 1). The decrease in the Pt dispersion from 24 to 0% during the catalytic
reaction is more than estimated by the decrease in SBET from 289 to 171 m2 g–1; this correlates with the weak interactions between Pt and SiO2.27 Notably, the Pt catalysts supported
on the two different TiO2 phases were found to exhibit
contrasting behaviors; Pt/TiO2-A was found to be much more
active and stable than Pt/TiO2-R, and its steady-state
conversion efficiency was 10-fold higher at 600 °C (Figure 1). A similar behavior
was observed for the catalytic reaction at 650 °C (not shown).
Although the SBET and DPt values of the two fresh Pt/TiO2 catalysts
were different (Table 1), they decreased to similar values after they were used for the
catalytic SO3 decompositions at 600 and 650 °C, where
each of the crystal phases remained unchanged. Because the decreases
in SBET and DPt observed in the atmosphere containing water vapor (18 vol %) were
more pronounced than those observed after the catalysts were treated
in the dry N2 atmosphere (Table 1), the water vapor atmosphere was believed
to have accelerated the deterioration of the catalyst structures.
The negligible value of DPt for the spent
catalysts is owing to the weak CO adsorption onto large grown Pt particles,
the amount of which cannot be determined by the pulsed adsorption
technique. As described later, the actual size of Pt particles increased
from ∼2 nm to the range of 3–30 nm during long-term
catalytic reactions (see Figures 5 and 7).

Figure 2 shows the
temperature dependences of the SO3 conversions on Pt/TiO2-A and Pt/TiO2-R; it can be clearly seen that Pt/TiO2-A converted significantly more SO3 than Pt/TiO2-R did over the entire temperature range. The kinetic analysis
for Pt/TiO2-A was performed at a weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) that was twice as high as the initial amount (220 g-H2SO4 g–1 h–1) in a
lower temperature range (500–600 °C) to ensure that its
steady-state conversions did not exceed 20% (not shown). The temperature
dependences of the SO3 decomposition rates yielded linear
relationships between the logarithmic rates and the reciprocal absolute
temperatures (1/T), and the slopes of these were
found to correspond to the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the supported catalysts (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). As summarized in Table 2, the value of Ea for Pt/TiO2-A was 94 kJ mol–1, which was close to that of the Pt-based catalysts
reported by Spewock et al.28 Pt/TiO2-R, however, exhibited a much higher Ea (160 kJ mol–1). The data from Table 2 also suggest that
Pt/TiO2-A exhibited partial orders with respect to SO3 and O2 of m = 0.65 and n = −0.08, respectively, whereas Pt/TiO2-R showed a more negative dependence on O2 (n = −0.20) (see Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information). The SO3 decomposition
is, therefore, more significantly inhibited by coexisting oxygen,
which is considered to be strongly bound onto the surface of Pt when
it is supported on TiO2-R.

To elucidate the reason for the
contrasting catalytic behaviors
of Pt/TiO2-A and Pt/TiO2-R, we analyzed the
oxidation states of the Pt surfaces using a curve-fitting analysis
of Pt 4f XPS, as shown in Figure 3. The peaks observed at different binding energies
were assigned according to the data from the literature.29 Both of the fresh TiO2-supported
catalysts (Figure 3a) exhibited Pt 4f7/2 at a binding energy of ∼72.7
and Pt 4f5/2 at ∼76.5 eV when calcined in air; both
of these peaks were assigned to Pt2+ (PtO). Another set
of peaks that were observed, specifically those at ∼75 and
≥78 eV, were assigned to the further oxidized Pt4+ (PtO2). It should be noted that the fresh Pt/TiO2-A showed small contributions of metallic Pt (Pt0) at the binding energies of 71.2 and 74.5 eV, which were not observed
for Pt/TiO2-R, even after the peaks in the spectrum were
separated. Although the oxidized Pt species were dominant in both
of the fresh catalysts, after the SO3 decompositions at
600 and 650 °C, both of the catalysts exhibited completely different
features (Figure 3b);
the peaks due to the metallic Pt species were significantly more intense
for Pt/TiO2-A, whereas those assigned to the oxidized Pt
species (Pt2+ and Pt4+) were weaker. Contrastingly,
the peaks due to oxidized Pt remained unchanged for Pt/TiO2-R after the catalytic reaction, in which another type of oxidized
Pt, Pt4+, appeared at 74.0 and 78.0 eV; this indicates
that there was a further interaction between Pt oxide and the rutile
phase under the catalytic reaction atmosphere. These results suggest
that the preferential formation of metallic Pt is the prime cause
of the higher catalytic activity of Pt/TiO2-A. The higher
fraction of metallic Pt than oxidized Pt which was found in the present
study is in accordance with the less negative partial order of the
SO3 decomposition rate with respect to O2 which
is shown in Table 2.

Long-Term Stability of
Pt/TiO2-A
Pt/TiO2 is known to be an
active and stable catalyst for SO3 decompositions; however,
only the equilibrium TiO2 phase
with a rutile structure has been studied thus far because its high
thermal stability is needed for conducting conventional SO3 decompositions at the required high-temperature region (∼800
°C).2,10−12 The present study demonstrates,
for the first time, that Pt loaded on anatase TiO2 is a
superior catalyst for SO3 decompositions at moderate reaction
temperatures (≤650 °C). Nevertheless, the equilibrium
conversion of SO3 to SO2 at a temperature of
600 °C is still below 40%, as shown in Figure 2; therefore, an equilibrium-shift reactor
is necessary. Catalytic membrane reactors are an example of such reactors,30 and they enable O2 separation from
a catalyst bed so that the forward SO3 decomposition can
be shifted and the reaction efficiency improved.

The long-term
stability of SO3 decomposition catalysts is another important
issue when considering using them in solar thermochemical hydrogen
production. The catalyst stability test for Pt/TiO2-A was,
therefore, conducted under realistic conditions, namely, T = 600 °C and WHSV = 11 g-H2SO4 g-cat–1 h–1. The initial SO3 conversion observed in this experiment was approximately 35%, which
corresponds to more than 90% of the equilibrium value (38%). Figure 4 plots the relative
activity, which is normalized by the average conversion during the
first 50 h, as a function of time on stream. The plots show some scattering,
the extent of which is mostly smaller than a systematic error of 2%.
During 1000 h of continuous catalytic reactions, no noticeable deactivation
was observed, and the overall deactivation corresponded to only 4%
of the initial SO3 conversion. The deactivation kinetics
of the SO3 decomposition over Pt/TiO2-A was
studied using a simple power law equation, which is given in eq 4;31−36 this equation assumes that the concentration of the active sites
is a time-dependent power function of the remaining active sites,
and the rate of deactivation is independent of the involved chemical
species 4  where rd and kd are the rate of deactivation and the rate
constant for deactivation, respectively, and d is
the order of deactivation. The relative catalyst activity (a) is expressed as the rate of reaction on the deactivated
catalyst with time (rt) divided by that on the fresh catalyst (r0). This is reasonable considering the sintering and vaporization
loss of Pt in the absence of complicated metal–support interactions
during the stability test as described below. By integrating eq 4 with initial limits of t = 0 and a = 1, the following equations
can be obtained: 5   6  

Figure 4 Catalyst stability test at 600 °C for Pt/TiO2-A
(WHSV = 11 g-H2SO4 g-cat–1 h–1). The dotted lines are drawn by the kinetic
expression with the order of deactivation, d = 2,
and the deactivation rate constants, kd = (a) 1.5 × 10–5, (b) 3.0 × 10–5, (c) 4.1 × 10–5, and (d) 6.2 × 10–5 h–1.

As depicted in Figure 4 (d = 2) and Supporting Information (Figure S4, d = 1), the observed
activity data as a function of time on stream do not conflict with
both equations in the 1000 h period investigated. By comparing them
with the calculated deactivation curves, kd can be estimated to be between 4 × 10–5 and
6 × 10–5 h–1. Using the kinetic
expression, the deactivation after 1 year (∼8000 h) was estimated
to be 25–34% (d = 2).

For the mechanism
of the catalyst deactivation to be understood,
the compositions and microstructures of the spent catalysts were analyzed
after the stability tests had been conducted for 1000 h. For reference
purposes, we also treated the catalysts in a gas stream of either
4 vol % O2 or 4 vol % O2 and 18 vol % H2O balanced with N2 at 600 °C for 1000 h. The
concentrations and gas feed rate were the same as those used in the
catalytic SO3 decompositions. The spent catalysts were
taken from both the upstream and downstream parts of the catalyst
bed, which were denoted as “up” and “down,”
respectively. Table 3 summarizes SBET, DPt, and Pt contents of the catalysts both before and after
the stability tests. The Pt contents in the upstream part were found
to decrease from 1.0 to 0.95 wt % after 1000 h of the catalytic reaction
at 600 °C. This may be indicative of a loss in Pt because it
is greater than the analytical error of ±0.02 wt % that we used.
When the catalyst was placed in either the O2/N2 or the O2/H2O/N2 flow mixtures,
the loss of Pt was found to be smaller. SBET and DPt were found to significantly
decrease during the stability tests; however, it should be noted that
a substantial decrease of these values occurred during the very early
stages of the reactions (Table 1), at which points no noticeable deactivations were observed
(Figure 1).

Figure 5 compares the XRD patterns of the fresh and
spent catalysts.
Regardless of the atmosphere in which they were used, the spent catalysts
showed no diffraction peaks ascribable to the rutile phase, which
indicates that the anatase phase was stable against phase transformations
under SO3 decompositions at 600 °C. The only change
observed under both atmospheres was the appearance of Pt with a sharpening
of the diffraction lines of anatase, although no significant differences
were detected between the upstream and downstream parts of the catalyst
bed. Figures 6 and 7 compare the transmission
electron and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM, respectively)
images of the fresh and spent catalysts, respectively. In the SEM
images, the fresh catalysts were found to consist of TiO2 particles with almost equal sizes that were smaller than 100 nm;
by contrast, particles in the spent catalysts showed larger sizes
(∼100 nm) and smooth spherical surfaces produced through neck-growth
sintering. The growth of the Pt particles on TiO2 can be
clearly observed by the dark contrasts in the TEM images (Figure 7). Although Pt particles
that were smaller than 2 nm were mainly present in the fresh catalysts,
larger Pt particles of approximately 3–5 nm were observed in
the spent catalysts. The observed sizes of the Pt particles are smaller
than those estimated from DPt in Table 3 (approximately 8
nm for the fresh catalyst). The inconsistency may be due to the pretreatment
condition for pulsed CO chemisorption, where the sample was reduced
at a lower temperature (200 °C) to prevent the strong metal–support
interaction (SMSI) effects, compared to 400 °C for the reduction
of other catalysts (Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2). It should be noted that the XRD of the spent catalysts
(Figure 5) shows weak
but sharp diffraction lines due to the presence of considerably larger
Pt crystallites, the size of which was estimated to be 31 nm by an
X-ray line-broadening analysis made using the Scherrer equation. These
results explain the wide distribution range of the Pt particle sizes
ranging from several nanometers to over 30 nm. Figure 8 shows the Pt 4f XPS spectra for the spent
catalysts, which were very similar to those of the short-term catalytic
reactions (Figure 3). The active metallic state Pt is, therefore, almost wholly preserved
under the catalytic conditions at 600 °C for 1000 h. This is
another reason why the catalyst shows only a small amount of deactivation.
Again, no significant differences between the upstream and downstream
parts of the catalyst bed were detected by SEM, TEM, or XPS (not shown).

Discussion
Effects of the TiO2 Phase on SO3 Decomposition
Activity
The present study demonstrated, for the first time,
that Pt/TiO2-A has a greater SO3 decomposition
activity than Pt/TiO2-R in a moderate temperature range
of 600 °C. On TiO2-A, Pt is mainly present in the
metallic state under the reaction gas mixtures, whereas Pt oxides
(PtO2 and PtO) are dominant on TiO2-R. The kinetic
analysis shown in Table 2 suggests that Pt/TiO2-A exhibits partial orders with
respect to SO3 and O2 of m =
0.65 and n = −0.08, respectively. The negative
order with respect to O2 implies that the oxygen release
after the dissociation of SO3 into SO2 and O
is a key step in determining the overall SO3 decomposition
rate. Although Pt/TiO2-R also shows the same trend in the
partial orders, its more negative order with respect to O2 (n = −0.20) than that of Pt/TiO2-A means that the easier oxidation of the Pt deteriorates the active
site needed for the SO3 decomposition. The metallic Pt
site preferred on TiO2-A compared to TiO2-R
under the present reaction condition is likely the reason for the
higher catalytic activity.

The greater SO3 decomposition
activity of metallic Pt on anatase should be closely associated with
the reaction steps on the surface. Rashkeev et al. discussed the SO3 decomposition mechanism over Pt supported on rutile TiO2 by using a combined experimental and theoretical approach
that uses density-functional-theory (DFT)-based first-principle calculations.13 They found that the catalytic activity of various
precious metals supported on rutile TiO2 at 850 °C
decreased in the following order: Pt > Pd > Rh > Ir >
Ru. According
to their calculation model, the activity and deactivation of the catalysts
can be determined by (i) the rate of the detachment of O atoms from
the SO3 species (SO3s → SO2s + Os; the subscript s means adsorbed species) and (ii)
the removal rate of the decomposition products (Os, Ss, and SOxs) from the surface of
the metal nanoparticles. Their calculations concluded that the former
rate was always faster than the latter rate in both of these cases;
this suggests that Pt is more efficient than the other precious metals,
as they all adsorbed O, S, and SOx more
strongly. Although all of these precious metals promoted the chemisorption
of SO3 and its subsequent dissociation into SO2s and Os, Pt was found to be most efficient in removing
these decomposition products. The results of the present comparative
study of Pt/TiO2-A and Pt/TiO2-R corroborate
these results.

The oxygen equilibrium reactions of Pt are as
follows 7   8  

The equilibrium partial oxygen pressures (pO2) of each reaction were calculated using the standard
Gibbs energy, ΔG° = −RT ln(pO2)0.5, as
a function of temperature. The as-calculated phase equilibria in the
Pt and Pt oxide systems (see the Supporting Information, Figure S5) predict that, at a reaction temperature of 600 °C,
the metallic state (Pt) will be the sole stable phase when the present
reaction (SO3 = SO2 + 0.5O2) reaches
equilibrium. Therefore, Pt oxides that have survived under the reaction
atmosphere at this temperature should be stabilized by the interactions
with the rutile TiO2 support. A similar trend was recently
reported for the higher Pt oxidation states on rutile TiO2 than on anatase TiO2 by Taira et al.,37 who pointed out a few possible reasons for this: (i) the
reactivity of the surface oxygen, (ii) the epitaxy at the interface,
and (iii) impurities. Because the rutile phase is more prone to forming
oxygen vacancies than the anatase phase, oxygen supplied by the TiO2 surface can be responsible for the oxidation of the supported
Pt. They proposed that PtO2 has a rutile-type crystal structure
and thus provides an epitaxial PtO2/TiO2 interface,
which should stabilize the oxide state of the Pt. However, this hypothesis
needs more discussion. PtO2 crystallizes as both the CdI2-type (α-PtO2, hexagonal, ambient pressure
form) and the rutile-type (β-PtO2, orthorhombic,
high-pressure form) structures.38,39 Because the formation
of the latter phase generally requires heating at 500 °C under
O2 pressures of ≥40 kbar,40,41 it is unlikely to form on the present Pt/TiO2-R catalysts
prepared under ambient pressure. The structure of α-PtO2 has not been satisfactorily solved because of its low crystallinity.
Even in the present study, the crystal structure of PtO2 in Pt/TiO2-R could not be identified experimentally (by
XRD and Raman spectroscopy). Considering the similarity of dimension
and ionic arrangement on the (100) planes of α-PtO2 and rutile TiO2, the (100) interface model may explain
the reason for the stabilization effect. Our DFT calculation supported
this conclusion (see the Supporting Information, Figure S6). It was also pointed out that a chlorine contaminant
in the rutile phase may play a key role in the oxidation of the supported
Pt; however, the catalytic behavior in the present study was not influenced
when the catalysts were prepared using Cl-free TiO2 and
Pt sources (Ti(OC3H7)4 and Pt(NH3)2(NO2)2). In the XPS results
shown in Figure 3,
Pt/TiO2-R exhibits three sets of Pt oxidation states after
the catalytic reactions, whereas only two sets are present in the
fresh catalyst; this implies that there are interactions between the
Pt oxides and the rutile phase under the SO3 decomposition
condition and that this plays a key role in the unusual stability
of Pt oxides.

Effects of the TiO2 Phase on Catalyst
Stability
Another important role of anatase TiO2 is to achieve
the long-term stability of Pt/TiO2-A. During the 1000 h
catalytic reaction at 600 °C performed in the present study,
the majority of the Pt surface was kept in the active metallic state
(Figure 8), which is
why there was very little deactivation of the catalyst. By contrast,
Pt was stabilized as less active oxides (PtO2 and/or PtO)
on TiO2-R; the activity was found to soon decline as a
function of time on stream at 600 °C (Figure 1) and could not be restored, even after exposure
to the reaction atmosphere for a long time. When Pt/TiO2-R was treated by H2 at 200 °C prior to the catalytic
reaction, the as-deposited metallic Pt enhanced the initial SO3 conversion at 600 °C (see the Supporting Information, Figure S7); however, the activity soon declined
as a function of time on stream because, on the rutile phase, it was
difficult to prevent the oxidation of Pt under the present reaction
atmosphere.

It is known that Pt oxides, especially those in
the form of PtO2, are not only less active but also more
volatile than metallic Pt. Thermodynamic calculations predict that
PtO2 has an equilibrium vapor pressure of 10–11 bar, whereas metallic Pt has an equilibrium vapor pressure less
than 10–26 bar at an equilibrium O2 concentration
(4 vol %) under the present SO3 decomposition condition
at 600 °C (see the Supporting Information, Figure S8). When the vaporization equilibrium of PtO2 is achieved instantly with a flowing gas at a particular flow rate
and the loss simply reflects the equilibrium concentration at the
volume of gas passed through the catalyst in the given time, the loss
in Pt after 1000 h of the reaction at 600 °C should be 0.01%
of the initial Pt loading (i.e., 1 wt %), which is far less than the
experimental error. These considerations seem to rule out the vaporization
loss occurring as PtO2 in the present system. However,
such losses should be considerable when the temperature exceeds 800
°C because, at this temperature, the equilibrium vapor pressure
of PtO2 increases by nearly 3 orders of magnitude (∼10–8 bar); this means that there will be a much more significant
loss of the initial Pt loading (i.e., up to a few %). Petkovic et
al. reported that the SO3 decomposition over Pt-loaded
rutile TiO2 for ∼240 h at 850 °C resulted in
a loss of over 30% of the Pt, from 0.13 to 0.09 wt %;11 this group later observed that the amount of Pt loaded
on rutile TiO2 decreased from 0.90 to 0.85 wt % during
548 h of a SO3 decomposition at the same temperature.12 Another possible explanation for the Pt loss
observed after the stability test in the present study is that Pt
is transported via diffusion over the support surface, which is known
to be a growth mechanism of the supported Pt particles under oxidizing
atmospheres.42 Because the majority of
the Pt loss was found to occur at the upstream part of the catalyst
bed (Table 3), exposure
to a strong corrosive environment containing the highest possible
concentration of SO3 in the present study is considered
to be a factor that would accelerate the transport of Pt downstream.
Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to clarify the details
of the mechanism of the Pt loss at moderate temperatures.

Conclusions
The present study demonstrated that Pt supported on anatase TiO2 exhibits a much greater activity for catalytic SO3 decompositions than Pt supported on rutile TiO2. This
superiority is especially pronounced at lower reaction temperatures,
at which point active metallic Pt species are deposited on anatase
TiO2; this is in stark contrast to the less active Pt oxides
(PtO2 and PtO) stabilized on rutile TiO2. The
kinetic analysis performed demonstrated that the different catalytic
behaviors can be explained by the highly efficient dissociation of
SO3 and the smooth removal of the decomposition products
(SO2 and O2) from the metallic Pt species. The
catalyst stability test performed at 600 °C for 1000 h demonstrated
that the SO3 decomposition activity decreased to about
96% of the original level. The small activity loss is associated with
the slow sintering and the loss of Pt. However, because the phase
transformation from anatase to rutile was not observed, Pt loaded
on anatase should be considered to be a promising candidate for SO3 decomposition in solar thermochemical water splitting for
CO2-free H2 production.

Experimental Section
Preparation
and Characterization
Supported Pt catalysts
were prepared by a wet impregnation method that used an aqueous solution
of Pt(NO2)2(NH3)2 (Tanaka
Precious Metals) and two types of TiO2 powder supports,
which were supplied by the Catalysis Society of Japan. The anatase
phase of TiO2 (JRC-TIO-8) was used after the material was
thermally treated at 600 °C for 3 h in air (SBET = 90 m2 g–1). The rutile
phase of TiO2 (JRC-TIO-6; SBET = 107 m2 g–1) was used without further
treatment. The as-impregnated samples of the Pt catalysts were dried
at 110 °C overnight before being calcined at 500 °C for
3 h. The catalysts were prepared using both the anatase and rutile
TiO2 powders, which are referred to as Pt/TiO2-A and Pt/TiO2-R, respectively, in this paper. On the
basis of the amount of precursor used, the Pt loading (metallic Pt)
was calculated as 1.0 wt %. The Pt catalysts were also prepared using
two reference supports: γ-Al2O3 (JRC-ALO-8; SBET = 160 m2 g–1) and SiO2 (JRC-SIO-9A; SBET = 310 m2 g–1), which were also supplied
by the Catalysis Society of Japan.

Powder XRD measurements were
performed using monochromated Cu Kα radiation (30 kV, 20 mA;
Rigaku Multiflex). The chemical composition of the catalysts was analyzed
by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS, EDXL 300, Rigaku). The SBET value was calculated using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C (BELSORP,
BEL Japan). The Pt metal dispersion was determined by pulsed CO chemisorption
at 50 °C (BELCAT, BEL Japan) after the catalyst was reduced by
H2 at 400 °C. For Pt/TiO2 samples, however,
the reduction temperature was 200 °C to avoid the SMSI effects.43,44 The DPt value was calculated from the
molar ratio of chemisorbed CO per loaded Pt by assuming that a chemisorption
stoichiometry of Pt/CO was 1:1. The surfaces of the catalysts were
analyzed by XPS that used monochromated Al Kα radiation (12
keV, K-Alpha; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The binding energy was charge-referenced
to C 1s at 285 eV. TEM and SEM micrographs of the catalysts were acquired
using an FEI Tecnai F20 operated at 200 kV and an FEI QUANTA FEG 250
operated at 20 kV, respectively.

Catalytic Reactions
The catalytic reactions were carried
out in a quartz tubular flow reactor. Sulfuric acid (95%) was pumped
and vaporized at 450 °C in a flow of N2 and thermally
decomposed into SO3 and H2O. The resulting gas
mixture containing 14 vol % SO3, 18 vol % H2O, and N2 balance was then supplied to a catalyst bed
at a flow rate of F = 146 cm3 min–1 [standard temperature and pressure (STP)]. A granular
catalyst (W = 0.050 g, 10–20 mesh) was affixed
into a quartz tube (inner diameter = 8 mm) that contained quartz wool
at either end of the catalyst bed. Prior to the catalytic measurement,
the catalyst was aged at 600 °C under the reaction atmosphere
for 3 h. The temperature dependence of the catalytic activity was
determined at a WHSV of 110 g-H2SO4 g–1 h–1 (W/F = 3.4
× 10–4 g min cm–3). The catalyst
was then diluted with 0.45 g of dense SiC grains (1.1–1.4 mm
in size; Shin-Etsu Chemical); these grains have good heat conductivity,
which means that the heat transfer of the catalysis could be improved
and the plug-flow criteria could be satisfied. The SiC grains were
confirmed to not contribute toward the SO3 decomposition
at temperatures below 750 °C by the present study. The gas effluent
from the catalyst bed was then bubbled into an aqueous solution of
NaOH so that SO3 could be removed and dried using a dry
ice–ethanol trap. The gas was then introduced into a gas-analyzing
unit in which the O2 concentration was measured using a
magneto-pneumatic oxygen analyzer (Horiba MPA 3000) and a gas chromatographer
that was equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (He carrier,
MS-5A column, Shimadzu GC8A). The steady-state conversion of SO3 to SO2 was calculated using the concentration
of O2 in the gas effluent. The obtained value was consistent
with the SO2 concentration in the effluent gas, which was
determined using an iodimetric titration. A catalyst stability test
was conducted using Pt/TiO2-A in a similar manner. At a
constant temperature of 600 °C, the reaction mixture was supplied
continuously at a WHSV of 11 g-H2SO4 g–1 h–1 for 1000 h, and the O2 concentration
in the gas effluent was recorded so that the deactivation behavior
could be evaluated in terms of SO3 conversion as a function
of time on stream. After the stability test, the catalysts were characterized
by XRD, XRFS, SEM, TEM, XPS, and a gas adsorption technique. For the
sake of comparison, the catalysts were also treated in a gas stream
of either 4 vol % O2 or 4 vol % O2, 18 vol %
H2O, and N2 balance. The concentrations of O2 and H2O were almost the same as the equilibrium
concentrations under SO3 decompositions.

For the
kinetic analysis, the gas concentrations and reaction temperatures
were varied so that the steady-state conversions would not exceed
20%. The temperature dependence of the SO3 decomposition
rates yielded linear relationships between the logarithmic reaction
rates and the reciprocal absolute temperatures (1/T); these were used to calculate the apparent activation energies
of the SO3 decompositions. The effects of the SO3 and O2 partial pressures on the SO3 decompositions
were examined at 600 or 700 °C. Initially, the SO3 partial pressure (pSO3) was
varied from 2 to 16 kPa without O2 being supplied in the
gas feed. Following this, the O2 partial pressure (pO2) in the gas feed was varied from
0.2 to 0.9 kPa while pSO3 was
maintained at 14 kPa. The partial orders for SO3 (m) and O2 (n) were calculated
using the empirical rate equation that gives the rate as follows:
rate = kpSO3mpO2n. The thermodynamic calculations for the equilibrium O2 partial pressures were done using a commercially available
piece of software (HSC Chemistry, Outokumpu Research Oy).
