Anacardic acid (AA) and its derivatives are well-known for their
therapeutic applications ranging from antitumor, antibacterial, antioxidant,
anticancer, and so forth. However, their poor pharmacokinetic and
safety properties create significant hurdles in the formulation of
the final drug molecule. As a part of our endeavor to enhance the
potential and exploration of the anticancer activities, a detailed
study on the properties of selected AA derivatives was performed in
this work. A comprehensive analysis of the drug-like properties of
100 naturally occurring AA derivatives was performed, and the results
were compared with certain marketed anticancer drugs. The work focused
on the understanding of the interplay among eight physicochemical
properties. The relationships between the physicochemical properties,
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion attributes, and
the in silico toxicity profile for the set of AA derivatives were
established. The ligand efficacy of the finally scrutinized 17 AA
derivatives on the basis of pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity
parameters was further subjected to dock against the potential anticancer
target cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (PDB ID: 1W98). In the docked complex, the ligand molecules
(AA derivatives) selectively bind with the target residues, and a
high binding affinity of the ligand molecules was ensured by the full
fitness score using the SwissDock Web server. The BOILED-Egg model
shows that out of 17 scrutinized molecules, 3 molecules exhibit gastrointestinal
absorption capability and 14 molecules exhibit permeability through
the blood–brain barrier penetration. The analysis can also
provide some useful insights to chemists to modify the existing natural
scaffolds in designing new anacardic anticancer drugs. The increased
probability of success may lead to the identification of drug-like
candidates with favorable safety profiles after further clinical evaluation.

1 Introduction
Cancer is one of the major concerns in the medical field as it
causes increasing number of deaths day by day.1 In the past decades, there have been numerous anticancer drugs synthesized.
However, tumor recurrence and the adverse effects of the drugs because
of toxic intolerance are the key problems in the treatment of cancer.
Thus, there is an urgent and desperate need of finding anticancerous
drug molecules with negligible side effects and high efficacy. The
naturally occurring products have received special attention toward
the preparation of novel cancer preventives and therapeutic agents.2−4 Particularly, more natural products were identified with potential
anticancer activity.5,6 In the present work, virtual screening
and suitability of anacardic acid (AA) derivatives that inhibit the
anticancer target cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (PDB ID: 1W98) were studied. AA
originates from the nutshells of Anacardium occidentale (cashew)7 and found to act as an antitumor,
antibiotic, antioxidant, and gastroprotective agent.8 It is a combination of numerous closely related organic
compounds, each consisting of salicylic acid substituted with an alkyl
chain. In addition, it is used as a synthon for the production of
a variety of biologically active compounds and a capping agent for
the development of nanomaterials.9 For
the treatment of the most serious pathophysiological disorders like
cancer, oxidative damage, inflammation, and obesity, AA and its derivatives
have been strongly supported as therapeutic agents.7 Recent studies show that AA derivatives exert their action
in treating ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, breast carcinoma, and
lung carcinoma through various mechanisms.10−13 AA acts as a potential inhibitor
of histone acetyltransferase activity and sensitizes tumor cells to
ionizing radiation.13 With the anticipation
that AA can be eventually applied in the medicinal industry after
successful preclinical trials, Xiu et al. have investigated the role
of AA in cancer.14

However, during the clearance of the molecule under clinical trials,
wastage of the drugs and human efforts is unavoidable. In this regard,
computation methods were developed to predict the human pharmacokinetic
properties. With different levels of complexity for the screening
of large data set compounds, a variety of useful in silico ADME (absorption,
distribution, metabolism, excretion) models have been established.
Nowadays, the in silico tools are faster, simpler, and more cost-effective
than transitional investigational procedures.15 At present, because of the toxicity or lag of optimal pharmacokinetics
properties, large attrition rates of preclinical and clinical candidates
were observed in pharmaceutical industry. It is possible for medicinal
chemists to control the pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties of
a molecule through the structural modifications.16 Hence, in the present work, physicochemical, ADME attributes
and in silico toxicity17 of 100 AA derivatives
were evaluated, and the results were compared with well-known anticancer
drugs. The study would definitely help to identify the suitable oral
AA-based drug molecules based on the abovementioned properties and
their binding activities with the target cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Figure 1 shows the schematic
diagram of the work done in which the selection of compounds and screening
methods were illustrated.

process, and their interactions with the target (PDB ID: 1W98).

2 Materials and Methods
One of the main causes of drug development termination is poor
pharmacokinetic properties. Less or no toxicity, good oral bioavailability,
and optimum values of physicochemical properties are the key parameters
for the discovery of anticancer drugs. In the present work, 100 AA
derivatives were selected from the previous literatures8−14,18,19 for the evaluation of their pharmacokinetic properties. Among these,
the derivatives AA1–AA25 were obtained by alkyl chain modifications,
whereas AA26–AA50 were obtained by modifying both the alkyl
chain and functional groups (Figures S1 and S2). AA51–AA100 derivatives were obtained by introducing functional
groups like hydroxyl (−OH) and carboxylic (−COOH) groups
(Figures S3 and S4). A complete list of
AA derivatives used in this study is depicted in Table S1, whereas the name and structures of the finally scrutinized
molecules are depicted in Table 1 and the physicochemical properties of these derivatives
are listed in Tables 2–6.

The ADME-related physicochemical properties of 100 AA derivatives
including the marketed anticancer drugs were predicted by the Swiss
ADME online Web server.20 Two-dimensional
structures were drawn with the help of Cambridge software, that is,
ChemDraw Pro, version 12.0. A simplified molecular input line entry
system of all AA derivatives was generated with the help of an online
tool, that is, Swiss ADME. The physicochemical properties, lipophilicity
and solubility, of the derivatives were considered for the analysis.21

In addition, the BOILED-Egg model of the molecules was predicted
to reveal the capability of gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and permeability
of the blood–brain penetration barrier.22 The cutoff values of the physicochemical properties were
set by certain rules, that is, Lipinski’s rule of five (ROF),
bioavailability score, Ghose’s, and Veber’s rules.23−25 For drug-likeliness, the molecular parameters such as MW (molecular
weight), HBD (hydrogen bond donor), HBA (hydrogen bond acceptor),
log P (lipophilicity log), log S (aqueous solubility), TPSA (topological polar surface area), MW, nRot (number of rotatable bonds), and MR (molar
refractivity) were evaluated. For predicting the aforesaid properties,
Swiss vector machine algorithm26 is used.

There are two more important parameters, that is, plasma proteins
(Fu) and volume of distribution (VDss), which help in the determination of the
distribution of derivatives. The absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of all AA derivatives were
analyzed through the online available tool pkSCM (http://bleoberis.bioc.cam.ac.uk/pkcsm/).27

In silico data corresponding to the major human cytochrome P450
(CYP) isoforms involved in drug metabolism, such as CYP2C9, CYP2D6,
and CYP3A4, were also generated. To determine the excretion routes
of AA derivatives, the total clearance and renal OCT2 substrate were
predicted quantitatively. In drug attrition, the safety profile of
the derivatives comes under major factors.28 As per pharmacokinetic analysis, we assess some of the major toxicity
end points of all derivatives. Moreover, certain safety parameters
such as LD50, hepatotoxicity, skin sensitization, cellular toxicity,
and hERG liability (inhibition of dofetilide binding) were also evaluated.

After the pharmacokinetic evaluation of all the AA derivatives,
17 AA molecules were chosen based on the cutoff values set by Lipinski’s
ROF, bioavailability score, Ghose’s, and Veber’s rules.
Finally, the chosen molecules were docked with cyclin-dependent kinase
2 to evaluate their binding affinities and active binding residues.
For this process, the SwissDock docking server (http://www.swissdock.ch) is used.
The preparation of the target for docking was done by UCSF chimera.
Various docking parameters such as full fitness (FF, kcal/mol), total
number of clusters, cluster rank, Gibbs free energy (ΔG), hydrogen bonding, deltaGligsolvpol, and so forth were
analyzed.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural and Physicochemical Properties
The main emphasis has been on defining the physicochemical property
rules for the derivatives to reduce attrition and increase the likelihood
of them at various stages of anticancer drug development. Based on
the gold standards and earlier published research on various oral
bioavailability rules, 100 AA derivatives were evaluated together
with 10 marketed anticancer drugs against the key parameters of physicochemical
properties, that is, lipophilicity, log P, MW, TPSA,
HBD, HBA, nRot, and aqueous solubility
(log S).23−25 All physicochemical properties
are depicted in Table S1.

The MW
range of AA1–AA25 derivatives varies from 220 to 376, AA26–AA50
derivatives varies from 264 to 518, and AA51–AA80 derivatives
varies from 388 to 598, whereas the MW range for AA81–AA100
is much broader and varies from 260 to 597. The M log P value of AA1–AA25 derivatives varies
from 1.4 to 6, AA26–AA50 derivatives varies from 2.4 to 5.3,
and AA51–AA80 derivatives varies from 3.1 to 7.5, whereas AA81–AA100
derivatives show values varying from 2.2 to 6.4. There were no significant
differences in the log P values among the four groups,
although the alkyl-modified derivative set AA1–AA25 had a lower
span of log P values; meanwhile, each set shows predicted
values of some derivatives which are higher than the cutoff value
set by the Lipinski rule, RO5 ≤ 4.15. This reflects the fact
that molecules with out-of-range values of log P are
poorly soluble in fats, oil, lipids, and nonpolar solvents. The predicted
polarity (TPSA) ranges from 56 to 157 Å2 for AA1–AA25
derivatives, 20 to 120 Å2 for AA26–AA50 derivatives,
14 to 77 Å2 for AA51–AA80 derivatives, and
35 to 115 Å2 for AA81–AA100 derivatives. According
to the cutoff values set for TPSA (≤140 Å2)
by Veber et al.,24 95% of the AA derivatives
reported in this study are likely to have high probability of oral
bioavailability. A minimal number of HBDs ranging from 0 to 5 was
found in the AA derivatives.

All the 100 derivatives of AA in this study satisfy the rule of
Lipinski, HBA < 10. One important parameter for the oral bioavailability
is “MR” described by the Ghose filter.25 According to Lipinski’s rule, the value of MR should
lie between 40 and 13023 for drug-likeness.
The derivatives AA1–AA50 show that all the predicted values
fall within the range as described by the Ghose filter rule, whereas
the derivative set AA50–AA100 shows 30% violation.

In order to accurately access drug-likeness, Lipinski’s
RO5, Ghose filter, Vebers’s, Egan’s, and Muegge’s
rules are compared with certain marketed drugs. The detailed data
set of all AA derivatives with the violation of rules is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Results of AA derivatives against different violations.

The graph shown in Figure 2a reveals that most of the derivatives show one violation
of each rule, and few structures viz. AA11, AA12, AA16, and AA20–AA25
did not show any violation. Hence, they can be provisionally approved
for preclinical trials. The structures that show three violations
of the Muegge and Ghose filters must be excluded from further preclinical
processes. In Figure 2b, it is clear that the structures AA33 and AA34 did not show any
violation, and most of the derivatives violate more than one rule
for each filter. The Lipinski RO5 rule graph as shown in Figure 2c,d suggests that
the compounds AA72, AA75, and AA95–AA98 can be subjected for
further preclinical trials. Out of 100 investigated compounds, only
17 compounds fall within the allowed range of physicochemical properties
and satisfy all the key parameters of physicochemical properties.

3.2 Comparison of Physicochemical Properties of
AA Derivatives with Marketed Anticancer Drugs
Our analysis
shows that the optimal property ranges (covering 100 AA derivatives)
are 200 < MW ≤ 600, 1 < M log P ≤ 5, −6 ≤ Ali log S ≤ 0, 2 ≤ HBA ≤ 10, 1 ≤ HBD ≤
5, 50 ≤ TPSA ≤ 150 Å2, 0 ≤ nRot ≤ 10, and 40 ≤ MR ≤
155. They may be very helpful in the prospective design of anticancer
molecules. According to the RO5 rule, the key parameters of physicochemical
properties showed better results as compared to the marketed anticancer
drugs. The poor biopharmaceutical properties of the molecules, viz.
poor aqueous solubility and slow dissolution rate resulted in poor
oral bioavailability. In general, poor aqueous solubility is connected
to high lipophilicity, and hydrophilic derivatives are connected to
poor permeability, which means low absorption. Hence, ionization constants,
solubility, and lipophilicity measurements are helpful in the high-throughput
drug discovery paradigm. The relationship between lipophilicity and
pharmacokinetic properties is explained in in silico studies.29,30 In the present work, quantitative analysis shows that the finally
scrutinized AA derivatives were predicted to have a higher optimum
range of 13.18 for M log P, whereas
the predicted values of M log P for
the marketed anticancer drugs are in the range 2.12–5.6. Tables S1 and S2 depict the physicochemical and
ADMET parameters of all the selected molecules.

3.3 BOILED-Egg for Prediction of GI Absorption
and Brain Penetration
In the drug development process, GI
absorption and blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration play an
important role. The BOILED-Egg model helps in the computation of polarity
and lipophilicity of derivatives as it gives datasets with accuracy,
speed, and clear graphical outputs.22 This
model helps in drug development by filtering the chemical libraries.

In the BOILED-Egg model, the high probability of passive absorption
of the GI tract is represented by the white region, whereas the yellow
region (yolk) represents the high probability of the BBB penetration.
In addition, the blue color indicator of the molecule shows that the
molecule is actively effluxed by P-glycoprotein, represented as (PGP+), whereas the red color indicator shows the nonsubstrate
of P-gp, represented as (PGP–).

The analysis predicts that the molecules AA1–AA25 (Figure S5a) show high GI absorption, with nearly
40% of the molecules also exhibiting BBB penetration, and all of them
are predicted as the nonsubstrates of P-gp (PGP–); 90% of the molecules AA26–AA50 (Figure S5b) show GI absorption, with nearly 40% of them also exhibiting
BBB penetration. The BOILED-Egg plot of all the AA derivatives is
presented in Figure S5. The predicted results
of the derivatives AA51–AA80 (Figure S5c) consisting of benzamide and benzyl amine are shown. All the benzamide-based
AA molecules and most of the benzyl amine-substituted AA derivatives
show low GI absorption, and they do not exhibit significant BBB permeability.
Most of the derivatives in the molecule set AA5–AA80 are P-gp
substrates. The prediction of the BOILED-Egg results of the molecule
set AA81–AA100 (Figure S5d), which
includes thiazole, imidazole, oxazole, sildenafil, dihydropyridine,
and macrolide AA derivatives, shows low GI absorption, and they do
not exhibit BBB permeation. The BOILED-Egg model prediction of GI
absorption and BBB permeation of the finally scrutinized 17 AA derivatives
is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 BOILED-Egg model of AA derivatives.

3.4 Prediction of ADMET and Related Properties
For the development of a drug, the derivatives should have good
ADMET profile. With the help of significant advancement in high-throughput
in vitro ADME, computational scientists were able to predict the potential
liabilities, that is, susceptibility to efflux transporters, low permeability,
and so forth, of derivatives, which are associated with new potential
derivatives. For the assessment of Caco2 cell permeability, P-gp efflux
liability, and human intestinal absorption of anacardic derivatives,
we have evaluated the ADME properties (in silico profiling).32 On the basis of the ADME model, we can evaluate
the permeability of a molecule, whether it is low or high. The permeability,
that is, log Papp (10–6 cm/s) rate, is considered to be high if log Papp > 0.9 and considered to be low if log Papp < 0.9. The Caco2 cell permeability of AA derivatives
is mentioned in Table S2.

Of the
AA derivatives, 80% show high log Papp values. Similar results were also analyzed in the assessment of
P-gp efflux liabilities of AA derivatives. The assessment of P-gp
efflux liabilities was done with the help of preADMET’s [https://preadmet.bmdrc.kr/] P-gp substrate model. Only 25% of anacardic derivatives were found
as P-gp efflux substrates. The predicted ADMET parameters of AA derivatives
are listed in Table S2. For the achievement
of an optimal clinical drug/derivative, a derivative should have high
log Papp and low P-gp efflux liability.

In addition, we have calculated the total human intestinal absorption
percentage (%). For the GI tract dissolution and stability, a systematic
oral dosage should have pH 1–2 in fasted state and 3–7
in fed state in stomach, including a neutral environment of small
intestine, that is, pH 4.4–6.6.32 The human intestinal absorption percentage (%) of the AA derivatives
was analyzed with the help of an online server tool, pkCSM.27 Except two AA molecules (AA99 and AA100), the
rest of the other AA derivatives shows good human intestinal absorption.
The predicted human intestinal absorption percentage (%) values for
all the AA molecules are listed in Table S2.

In plasma, almost all drugs exist in equilibrium between the bound
and unbound states with serum proteins at different affinities. Only
an unbound drug can show interactions with anticipated molecular targets.22 Therefore, the efficiency of a drug is affected
by the binding efficacy of the drug with whole blood proteins. With
the help of the predictive model of pkCSM, we have evaluated the fraction
unbound (Fu) and steady-state volume of
distribution (VDss) of 100 AA derivatives. VDss is a key parameter, which helps in suggestion
for the total dose of a drug. The predicted values of Fu and VDss of all AA derivatives
are listed in Table S2.

For drug designing and screening of new chemical drugs, pharmaceutical
industries use in silico studies for early prediction.33 For evaluating AA derivatives as anticancer
drugs, we have evaluated the toxicity end points with the help of
the pkCSM tool. The toxicity end points consist of the inhibition
of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) monooxygenase enzymes.34 AMES toxicity, LD50 (lethal rat acute toxicity), hepatotoxicity,
skin sensitization, and inhibition of hERG potassium ion channel effects
are determined for the evaluation of drug–drug interactions
(DDIs).35 The toxicity data sets of all
AA derivatives are listed in Table S3.
With the help of pkCSM, inhibitions of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were qualitatively
predicted and the results are depicted in Table S3. Out of 100 AA derivatives, 80% AA derivatives were evaluated
as noninhibitors of CYP3A4, and only two AA derivatives show inhibition
against CYP2D6. After the evaluation of these parameters, drug excretion
and drug metabolism were evaluated. With the prior knowledge of metabolic
pathways of drugs, one can easily predict DDIs, pharmacokinetics,
and toxicities.36 Here, our primary concern
is the inhibition of CYP3A4, which helps in finding out the correlation
with increasing MW and log P.37 Inhibition of CYP3A4 is related to issues with DDIs and
clearance. The total clearance of 100 AA derivatives was measured,
which is a combination of hepatic and renal clearance, and is listed
in Table S3.

The major evaluation that emerged from these data was that the
derivatives showing clog P < 3 and TPSA > 75 Å2 were 2.5 times more nontoxic, whereas derivatives showing
high lipophilicity (clog P > 3) and low polar surface
area (TPSA < 75 Å2) are considered to be highly
toxic in short-term animal studies. Hence, we have evaluated the lipophilicity of AA derivatives. Lipophilicity
with small polar functionalities has high chances of becoming toxic.
From the evaluation, it is revealed that toxicity occurs when log P > 3; on the other hand, the value of TPSA shows very little
or no influence on the drug toxicity. Hence, it is clear that the
early prediction of log P and TPSA is very helpful
in the drug designing and development process in order to avoid wastage
of chemicals.

Establishment of meaningful correlations between the physicochemical
properties and ADMET properties of AA derivatives might be useful
for future anticancer drug discovery. Based on our analysis, the results
of AA derivatives show good and accepted prediction of physicochemical
properties in comparison to Lipinski’s RO5, Ghose filter, Vebers’s,
Egan’s, and Muegge’s rules for oral bioavailable drugs
and in comparison with the physicochemical properties of marketed
anticancer drugs. The correlation of the results of the accepted physicochemical
properties with the predicted ADMET results shows that only seven
AA derivatives, AA11, AA22, AA24, AA25, AA95, AA97, and AA98, fall
within the accepted range of the parameters of ADMET. However, the
docking studies of the finally scrutinized 17 derivatives were investigated,
as they acquire adequate pharmacokinetic properties for oral bioavailability.

3.5 Molecular Docking Studies
Molecular
docking studies were analyzed for exploring the interaction mechanism
between the receptor sites and inhibitors.38 In the field of drug discovery, the prediction of interactions between
molecules and their targets has a great importance. One can easily
find out the mechanisms of selectivity by the docking of molecules
with protein targets.39−41 In this work, the activities of anacardic derivatives
were screened out against the target cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (PDB
ID: 1w98). Cyclin-dependent
kinase 2, also known as cell-division protein kinase 2, is an enzyme
usually found in humans. It is encoded as CDK2 gene. It is necessary
for cell cycle progression and mostly overexpressed in cancer cells.
By using the SwissDock Web server (http://www.swissdock.ch), molecular docking of all the filtered
17 AA derivatives (AA11, AA12, AA16, AA20–AA25, AA33, AA34,
AA72, AA75, AA95, AA96, AA97, and AA98) was performed against human
cyclins or cell division protein kinase 2 (PDB ID: 1w98).42 For the cell cycle, cyclins are essential proteins. Perturbation
of the cyclin function can cause cancer formation. The structural
factors and atomic coordinates of the protein cyclin were deposited.43 The results pointed out that the filtered AA
derivatives form conventional bonds with the receptor sites. Different
parameters like FF (kcal/mol), ΔG (Gibb’s
free energy), ligand solvation energy, hydrogen bonding (interactions),
and so forth of docking were analyzed. On the basis of FF and cluster
formation, all suitable binding modes were analyzed.44 All the output clusters were ranked in accordance with
hydrogen bonding (interactions) and the FF score. A cluster rank “0”
is considered to be the best FF score. A molecule is said to have
more favorable binding modes with a better fit if the FF score shows
greater negative value.45 The docked conformations
having the lowest binding energy were selected for discussion.46 However, for the most favorable interaction,
if a molecule has a small docking score, then it is said to have a
higher binding affinity of ligands for a particular receptor.47 The FF score, binding affinity, and active residues
of docked conformations are depicted in Table 7. Out of 17 docked complexes, the derivatives
AA20, AA21, and AA22 show three hydrogen-bonding interactions with
the target residues, whereas the derivative AA75 shows the maximum
FF score (−3054.45) with one hydrogen-bonding interaction with
LEU 2.418 Å. The docked conformations of 17 AA derivatives and
the target (PDB ID: 1w98) are presented in Figure 4.

4 Conclusions
For the drug designing and development process, the evaluation
of pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties is the primary task.
In the present work, 100 AA derivatives were evaluated with the in
silico screening procedure based on ADME parameters. The results show
the optimal property range (covering 100 derivatives of AA) used to
select oral bioavailable drugs. From the evaluation of in silico computational
studies including ADME, the pkCSM data revealed that 80% of the selected
AA derivatives in this work have shown high Caco2 permeability of
log Papp <0.9 and 25% of the AA derivatives
were found as P-gp efflux substrates with low-to-moderate clearance
rates. The docking results of the finally scrutinized 17 derivatives
which were allowed to dock with the anticancer target cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 reveal that the AA derivatives are strongly bound with the
targets and inhibit the target through hydrogen-bonding interactions.
Better bioactivity score, drug adsorption ability, and drug-likeness
of these derivatives pave a new research arena with vegetable feedstocks.
Rege et al. have recently explored the dual functionality of certain
AA derivatives for efficient paclitaxel delivery in breast cancer
therapy.48,49 The higher binding affinity results of the
17 AA derivatives with the anticancer target (PDB ID: 1W98) and their in silico
pharmacokinetic studies would definitely provide motivation to biochemists
for performing further wet lab and clinical evaluations.
