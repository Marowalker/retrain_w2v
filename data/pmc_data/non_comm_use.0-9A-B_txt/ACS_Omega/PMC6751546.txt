Aluminum
nitride (AlN) is highly insulating and has a high thermal
conductivity. AlN also has the advantages of being nontoxic and chemically
stable. Therefore, it is a suitable sealing material for electric
devices. Previous studies have shown that the addition of NH4Cl has a large influence on the formation of AlN and can effectively
be used in its low-temperature synthesis without the use of special
equipment. However, it has not been clarified whether NH4Cl simply promotes the reaction between Al and nitrogen or directly
contributes to the nitridation reaction. In this study, which was
part of a series of studies on the development of low-temperature
synthesis methods for AlN, the nitridation behaviors of Al in Al–N2, Al–NH4Cl–N2, and Al–NH4Cl–He systems were determined, and the effects of the
heating temperature and amount of NH4Cl on the nitridation
behavior were examined in detail. When NH4Cl was added,
AlN began to form at 600 °C, a formation temperature that was
approximately 200 °C lower than that when only Al powder was
heated under a nitrogen stream. The fact that the formation of AlN
was also observed when the NH4Cl-added Al powder was heated
under a helium gas stream confirmed that nitrogen derived from NH4Cl contributed to the formation of the AlN. Furthermore, based
on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was clarified,
and the kinetic parameters for the nitridation of Al were determined.

==== Body
Introduction
Semiconductor devices such as large-scale
integrations (LSIs) and
integrated circuits (ICs) are protected by highly insulating sealing
materials to inhibit electrostatic breakdown due to static electricity
and leakage. In recent years, to achieve both high-performance and
low-cost electronic components, the miniaturization and high integration
of LSIs and ICs have been promoted, but the problem of increased power
consumption has become apparent. There are two types of leakage power
in LSIs: standby power consumption and operation power consumption.
Because the subthreshold current related to the former is highly temperature-dependent,
there is a problem with the leakage current increasing in the high-temperature
region. Moreover, the heat generated by semiconductor devices can
cause malfunctions or thermal runaway. Therefore, to protect semiconductor
devices and reduce their power consumption, sealing materials are
required that are both highly insulating and thermally conductive
to allow heat from a device to easily be emitted to the environment.

The use of a thermally conductive filler is believed to improve
the thermal conductivity of the sealing material used for a semiconductor
device. Aluminum oxide is chemically stable and harmless to the human
body. Moreover, its volume resistivity is higher than 1014 Ω·cm, while its thermal conductivity is as low as 20.5–29.3
W/(m·K).1 Beryllium oxide has excellent
insulation properties (volume resistivity = 1015–1017 Ω·cm) and an even higher thermal conductivity
(250–265 W/(m·K))1 but is a
highly toxic compound. On the other hand, aluminum nitride (AlN) is
highly insulating (volume resistivity >1014 Ω·cm)
and has a high range of thermal conductivity (140–320 W/(m·K)),1 which satisfies the requirements for a sealing
material. AlN also has the advantages of being nontoxic and chemically
stable, and its low density favors product miniaturization. However,
because the thermal conductivity of AlN decreases in the presence
of impurities such as oxygen, it is necessary to synthesize high-purity
AlN if it is to be used as a sealing material.

The main synthesis
methods for AlN are carbothermal reduction,
chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and direct nitridation. AlN synthesis
by carbothermal reduction involves heat-treating aluminum oxide or
aluminum hydroxide at 1400–1800 °C under a nitrogen or
ammonia gas stream in the presence of carbon as a reducing agent.2−7 In this method, the heat treatment is carried out under an oxygen
or air stream to remove residual carbon in a temperature range of
600–800 °C at which AlN is not oxidized. However, when
the sample temperature exceeds 800 °C, as a result of the combustion
heat of carbon, the purity decreases due to the oxidation of AlN.
Morgan et al.8 proposed a method for synthesizing
AlN by heating a boric acid added sample in nitrogen. However, although
the addition of boric acid is suitable for the synthesis of AlN for
refractory applications, it is unsuitable for synthesizing a sealing
material for use in electronic and optical devices because boron nitride
remains in the prepared AlN. In the CVD method, AlCl3 is
nitrided with nitrogen gas or ammonia gas at 650–750 °C
to obtain AlN, but precise control is required, such as vacuum conditions.9−12 On the other hand, in the direct nitridation method, a sample prepared
by adding alkali fluoride, alkali chloride, or sodium nitrite to Al
powder is heated at 650 °C, which is slightly lower than the
melting point of aluminum, and then the nitridation of aluminum is
conducted by increasing the heating temperature.1−21 Selvaduray and Sheet13 performed the
latter heating stage at 1600 °C for stabilization. Qiu and Gao14,15 reported that the addition of KCl and NH4Cl lowered the
nitridation temperature, and the diffusion of NH3 gas into
the solid was accelerated by the generation of voids formed by the
volatilization of KCl. Radwan and co-workers16,17 reported that the nitridation yield was 74% when the Al powder was
heated under a nitrogen gas stream at 1000 °C, but the yield
was improved to 94% when NH4Cl was added to the Al powder.
They concluded that the nitridation reaction was promoted by the gas-phase
reaction between the nitrogen gas and aluminum chloride vapor generated
upon the addition of NH4Cl. Watari et al. investigated
the reaction of ammonia or nitrogen gas with the AlCl3·NH3 vapor generated by reacting AlCl3 and NH3 at 453 K and then heating the AlCl3·NH3. As a result, it was revealed that when NH3 gas was used,
AlN was formed from the AlCl3·NH3 vapor,
whereas a large amount of AlCl3·NH3 remained
when nitrogen was used.18 The synthesis
of AlN with NH4Cl has previously been reported. When NH4Cl is used in the production of AlN, it may promote the reaction
of Al with N2(g) and act as a nitrogen source. However,
the reaction mechanism of Al and NH4Cl has not been clarified.

In the present study, the nitridation behavior of Al was investigated
following heat treatment with and without NH4Cl under N2 and helium (He) atmospheres. The effects of the heating temperature
and amount of NH4Cl on the nitridation behavior were examined
in detail. Furthermore, the nitridation reaction mechanism was clarified
based on the experimental results, and a kinetic analysis was conducted
to determine the kinetic parameters related to the formation of AlN.

Results
and Discussion
Formation of AlN in the Al–N2 System
Figure 1 shows the
change in the AlN yield (αAlN) with the reaction
temperature in the heat treatment of Al powder under a nitrogen gas
stream. Because the nitridation reaction should proceed according
to eq 1, α was
calculated from eq 2 1   2  where Winitial and Wobserved are the weights
of the sample before and after heat treatment, respectively; and Wtheoretical is the theoretical weight assuming
that the Al is completely converted to AlN. The nitridation of Al
began at approximately 800 °C where it was observed that the
Al powder started to melt. The nitridation reaction proceeded rapidly
from approximately 900 °C, and the α value reached 83%
at 1000 °C. Radwan and co-workers reported that an outer shell
of AlN was formed on the surfaces of the Al particles at the initial
stage of the nitridation reaction, and then the internal pressure
increased with the temperature as a result of the melting of the unreacted
Al. This led to the Al melt leaking out of the shell.16,17 The drastic increase in the AlN yield at approximately 900 °C
confirmed in this study was presumably due to the nitridation of unreacted
Al accompanying the collapse of the AlN shell. When the heat treatment
was carried out at 1000 °C for 1 h, the α value further
increased to 88%. Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of samples prepared
by heating Al powder at temperatures from 700 to 1000 °C under
a nitrogen stream. Because only peaks attributed to Al were observed
at 800 °C, it was confirmed that the formation of AlN only proceeded
significantly at temperatures greater than 900 °C. However, unreacted
Al remained even at 1000 °C.

Effect of NH4Cl Amount on AlN Formation in the Al–NH4Cl–N2 System
Samples with 30–70
wt % NH4Cl were heated under nitrogen streams at 1000 °C
for 1 h. Figure 3 shows
the X-ray diffraction patterns of the nitrided samples produced in
the Al–NH4Cl–N2 system. The addition
of NH4Cl promoted the nitridation of Al compared to the
sample heated in the Al–N2 system shown in Figure 2. In particular,
in the sample containing 70 wt % NH4Cl, the unreacted Al
completely disappeared. The NH4Cl/Al molar ratio of the
sample with 70 wt % NH4Cl was 1.17, whereas the samples
with 30–60 wt % NH4Cl had small NH4Cl/Al
ratios of 0.22–0.76. An NH4Cl/Al molar ratio greater
than one was confirmed to be desirable for the complete nitridation
of Al. In the Al–NH4Cl system, high-purity AlN could
be synthesized under the following conditions: NH4Cl amount,
70 wt %; reaction temperature, 1000 °C; time, 1 h. Qiu and Gao
prepared AlN by heating a mixture of Al, NH4Cl, and KCl
at 1000 °C for 5 h.14,15 In comparison, with
our Al–NH4Cl system, AlN could be synthesized in
a much shorter reaction time.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of samples synthesized at 1000
°C for 1 h with
additions of NH4Cl from 0 to 70 wt %.

Figure 4 shows the
changes in appearance of the samples with 30–70 wt % NH4Cl after heating at 1000 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen
stream. When the NH4Cl amount was less than 60 wt %, the
color of the product was dark gray, whereas the product obtained from
the 70 wt % sample was a light grayish white and clearly aggregated.
This is evidence that the sample melted once during the heat treatment
of the NH4Cl-added sample. An enlarged scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image showed that the aggregate consisted of uniform
AlN particles. The average particle size of the AlN was 1.8 μm,
and the particles ranged in size from 1.6 to 2.2 μm.

Figure 4 Changes in
appearances of samples with 30–70 wt % NH4Cl after
heating at 1000 °C for 1 h under nitrogen stream.

Effect of Reaction Temperature on AlN Formation in the Al–NH4Cl–N2 System
Samples with 70 wt
% NH4Cl were heated under nitrogen to temperatures ranging
from 500 to 1000 °C for 1 h. The X-ray diffraction patterns of
the obtained samples are shown in Figure 5. AlN peaks are observed at 600 °C,
which indicate that the AlN formation temperature decreased by approximately
200 °C compared to that when only Al powder was heated under
a nitrogen stream. When the reaction temperature was further increased
to 900 °C, the full conversion of Al to AlN was achieved, as
observed by the absence of the peaks corresponding to the unreacted
material.

1000 °C for 1 h with 70 wt % NH4Cl.

Role of NH4Cl in the Formation of AlN
The
distribution of elements changed with the temperature in the Al–NH4Cl–N2 system. Samples with 70 wt % NH4Cl were heated under nitrogen to temperatures ranging from
600 to 1000 °C for 1 h. The resulting element distributions in
the nitrided samples are listed in Table 1. The weight of the sample, which was the
sum of the Al, N, H, and Cl (indicated by circles), decreased to 22.9%
for the 600 °C sample and subsequently increased for samples
heated at temperatures over 700 °C. The weight loss for the 600
°C sample was presumed to be due to the volatilization of NH4Cl, which has a sublimation temperature of 338 °C, as
described in eq 3. 3

Figure 6 shows the
thermodynamic equilibrium calculations for the (a) Al and (b) N, H,
and Cl chemical forms in the heat treatment of NH4Cl under
an inert atmosphere using HSC chemistry (Outokumpu, ver. 5.0). Figure 6 shows that AlN can
be obtained from a reaction between Al and NH4Cl at temperatures
below 100 °C. Although the amount of AlN decreases at 100–300
°C where Al2Cl6(g) is stable, the amount
of AlN increases at temperatures above 300 °C. Because the direct
nitridation of Al with NH4Cl at temperatures below 100
°C, which is a solid–solid reaction, did not occur dynamically,
as shown in Figure 5, it is estimated that AlN could be formed through the reaction of
Al with N2(g) and/or NH3(g) derived from the
decomposition of NH4Cl, as shown in eqs 1 and 4. A decrease in
the Al content is observed at 600 °C in Table 1, which is presumed to be due to the volatilization
of AlCl3(g), as shown in the thermodynamic calculation
(Figure 6). AlCl3 has a sublimation temperature of 183 °C and is formed
according to eq 5. 4   5

equilibrium calculations of (a) Al and (b) other
components for the Al–NH4Cl–He system. Calculation
condition: Al–NH4Cl–He = 1.11:1.31:1000 (molar
ratio).

The Gibbs free energy values for
the decomposition of NH4Cl and formation of AlN are shown
in Figure 7. The nitridation
of Al by N2(g)
and NH3(g) according to eqs 1 and 4 is presumed to occur in
the entire temperature range from 0 to 1000 °C. Because the Gibbs
free energy of the formation of NH3(g) from NH4Cl according to eq 3 shows a negative value at temperatures greater than 380 °C,
NH4Cl is decomposed into NH3(g) and HCl(g) after
sublimation at 338 °C, and the decomposition gases influence
the formation of AlN and loss as AlCl3.

and reaction of Al.

A small amount of nitrogen
was observed in the sample heat-treated
at 600 °C. Based on the XRD pattern in Figure 5, this nitrogen is considered to be in the
form of AlN. On the other hand, the increase in nitrogen content observed
in the temperature range of 600–800 °C indicates the formation
of AlN by the reaction of Al and nitrogen because the NH4Cl has already disappeared by 600 °C, as shown in Figure 5.

Origin of the Nitrogen
in AlN Prepared with the Al–NH4Cl–N2 System
Samples with 70 wt
% NH4Cl were heated under helium to temperatures ranging
from 600 to 1000 °C for 1 h, and the formation of AlN was examined. Figure 8 shows the change
in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples with temperature
in the Al–NH4Cl–He system. Only peaks attributed
to Al and NH4Cl were observed at 600 °C, whereas the
formation of AlN was confirmed at 700 °C. Because the peak intensity
of the AlN did not change in the range of 700–1000 °C,
the nitridation of Al with NH4Cl occurred at approximately
700 °C.

600 to

Table 2 indicates
the changes in the distribution of elements with the reaction temperature
for the samples prepared using the Al–NH4Cl–He
system. Because negligible changes in the amounts of Al and N were
observed, the formation of AlN with the NH3(g) derived
from the decomposition of NH4Cl, as shown in eq 6, was considered to be complete
at temperatures between 600 and 700 °C. 6

It
was confirmed that the origin of the nitrogen in the AlN in
the Al–NH4C–He system was NH4Cl,
whereas the nitrogen in the Al–NH4Cl–N2 system came from both NH4Cl and the nitrogen gas.
Therefore, the amount of nitrogen in the AlN derived from the nitrogen
gas could be calculated from the difference in the nitrogen contents
listed in Tables 1 and 2. The calculated results are shown in Figure 9. The formation of AlN derived
from nitrogen gas was observed at temperatures greater than 700 °C.
Because the formation of AlN in the Al–N2 system
started at 800 °C (Figure 2), it was found that the addition of NH4Cl also
promoted the reaction between the Al and N2 gas.

Effect of NH4Cl Addition on AlN
Yield
Figure 10 shows a comparison
of the yields of AlN (α) formed during the heat treatment of
samples with and without NH4Cl in the temperature range
of 700–1000 °C for 1 h. The amount of NH4Cl
was set at 70 wt %. Because α could not be directly evaluated
from the weight change, it was calculated from the aluminum and nitrogen
contents according to eq 7 7  where WN and WAl are the contents of nitrogen
and aluminum in the sample, respectively, and NN and NAl are the atomic weights
of nitrogen and aluminum, respectively. The value of α reached
50, 84, and 89% in the Al–NH4Cl–N2 system at 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively, which confirmed
that the addition of NH4Cl allowed the synthesis temperature
of AlN to be effectively lowered. Radwan and co-workers reported that
when a sample with 50% NH4Cl was heated at 1000 °C
for 1 h in a nitrogen stream, a high nitridation extent of 95% was
obtained, but unreacted Al remained.16,17 In this study,
the nitridation extent reached 98%, and no unreacted Al was observed
after the heat treatment of the sample with 70 wt % NH4Cl at 1000 °C for 1 h. Thus, it was confirmed that increasing
the amount of NH4Cl was effective at achieving complete
nitridation.

of samples
with and without NH4Cl for 1 h.

Kinetic Analysis of AlN Synthesis
It has been shown
that the nitridation of Al in the Al–N2 system proceeds
according to the reaction outlined in eq 4, whereas for the Al–NH4Cl–N2 system, the reactions in eqs 1, 3, 4,
and 5 take place. It was assumed that the reaction
rate ri (i = 1, 3–5)
of each reaction could be expressed as a first order in the amount
of each compound, as shown in eqs 8–13, and that the reaction
rate constant of each reaction had an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence,
as shown in eq 13. 8   9   10   11   12   13  where ki, ki,0, and Ei (i = 1, 3–5) are the
reaction rate constant, frequency factor, and apparent activation
energy of each reaction, respectively. The simultaneous differential
equations for the mass balance of each compound were solved using
the Runge–Kutta–Gill algorithm, and the kinetic parameters, ki,0 and Ei, which could represent the experimental data, were determined.
The initial condition of the calculation is shown in eq 14. 14  

Figure 11 shows the results of simulations
of the formation of AlN in the Al–N2 and Al–NH4Cl–N2 systems, with the derived kinetic
parameters listed in Table 3. The apparent activation energy for the decomposition of
NH4Cl in eq 8 was determined to be E3 = 70 kJ/mol
based on a thermal decomposition experiment with the reagent NH4Cl alone. The solid lines in Figure 11 show the calculated values, and kinetic
parameters that can express the experimental data were successfully
determined.

Conclusions
The mechanism for the
nitridation of Al using NH4Cl
as an additive was investigated in detail to develop a low-temperature
synthesis process for AlN. White AlN, which was free of unreacted
Al, could be synthesized by adding 70 wt % NH4Cl to the
starting Al powder and heating the mixture at 1000 °C for 1 h.
With the NH4Cl addition, AlN started to form at 600 °C,
a formation temperature that was approximately 200 °C lower than
that when only Al powder was heated under a nitrogen stream. The formation
of AlN was also observed when the NH4Cl-added Al powder
was heated under a helium gas stream, which confirmed that the nitrogen
derived from NH4Cl contributed to the formation of AlN.
The reaction mechanism was estimated based on these experimental results,
and the formation behaviors of AlN in the Al–N2 and
Al–NH4Cl–N2 systems were successfully
simulated.

Materials and Methods
Samples
The Al powder (99.9%, EP,
Nacalai Tesque) and
NH4Cl (99.5%, EP, Nacalai Tesque) were used without purification.
Al and NH4Cl were mixed using a mortar and then used in
the nitridation experiments. The weight ratio of NH4Cl in the mixture was varied between
30 and 70 wt %. An image analysis determined that the average particle
size of the Al powder was 9.1 μm, with all of particles in the
size range of 7.0–16.0 μm.

Figure 12 Schematic diagram of
nitridation experiment setup.

Nitridation
Figure 12 shows a schematic diagram of a horizontal fixed-bed
reactor with a fused-silica tube (1000 mm in length, 21 mm i.d.).
A horizontal tubular furnace (EKR-16K, Isuzu Seisakusho Co.) was used
as the heating apparatus. The temperature of the outer wall of the
reaction tube was measured with a thermocouple to control the reaction
temperature. The mixture of Al and NH4Cl was contained
in an alumina boat (width × height × length: 16 × 12
× 80 mm), which was placed at the center of the heating section.
A 500 mL NTP/min flow of nitrogen or helium was supplied to the reactor,
which was heated at a rate of 15 °C/min to the desired final
temperature (500–1000 °C) and held for 1 h at that temperature.
After the heat treatment, the sample was immediately cooled to room
temperature. In order to investigate the role of nitrogen in the formation
of AlN, the heat treatment of Al powder alone was carried out under
a nitrogen gas stream.

Analysis
The products formed in
the nitridation process
were determined using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzer (Ultima
IV, Rigaku). The experimental conditions of the XRD measurements were
as follows: CuKα radiation; tube voltage/current, 40 kV/40 mA;
scan rate, 10°/min.

The sample was dissolved as described
below, and the Al content in the solution was determined using inductively
coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; SPS-5510, Seiko
Instruments). The sample was completely dissolved using the selective
dissolution method proposed by Yabuki et al.22 The sample (1 g) was added to a sodium hydroxide solution (100 mL,
2 mol/L) and agitated at temperatures from 80 to 90 °C for 90
min after which hydrochloric acid (50 mL, 6 mol/L) was added, and
the solution was agitated for 20 min.

The nitrogen content was
determined according to the analytical
method JIS R1675 (methods for chemical analysis of fine aluminum nitride
powders for fine ceramics).22 Ammonia gas,
which was generated by the steam distillation of the sample, was reacted
with an amide sulfate solution, and then the nitrogen content of the
sample was determined by the neutralization titration of the solution
with a sodium hydroxide solution.
