Sodium-ion batteries are promising
futuristic large-scale energy-storage
devices because of the abundance and low cost of sodium. However,
the development and commercialization of the sodium-ion battery solely
depends on the use of high-capacity electrode materials. Among the
various metal oxides, SnO2 has a high theoretical specific
capacity for sodium-ion battery. However, the enormous volume expansion
and low electrical conductivity of SnO2 hinder its capability
to reach the predicted theoretical value. Although different nanostructured
designs of electrode materials like SnO2 nanocomposites
have been studied, the effects of other cell components like electrolyte
and binder on the specific capacity and cyclic stability are yet to
be understood. In the present study, we have investigated the synergistic
effect of electrolyte and binder on the performance enhancement of
SnO2 supported on the intertwined network structure of
reduced graphene oxide partially open multiwalled carbon nanotube
hybrid as anode in sodium-ion battery. Our result shows that sodium
carboxyl methyl cellulose and ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate
as the electrolyte solvent offers a high specific capacity of 688
mAh g–1 and a satisfactory cyclic stability for
500 cycles. This is about 56% enhancement in specific capacity compared
to the use of poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder and propylene carbonate
as the electrolyte solvent. The present study provides a better understanding
of the synergistic role of electrolyte and binder for the development
of metal-oxide-based electrode materials for the advancement of the
commercialization of sodium-ion battery.

1 Introduction
Electrochemical
energy-storage devices characterized by low cost
and high efficiency have become attractive in the modern society especially
in the field of portable electronic devices and sustainable grid power
supply. The high energy density, long cycle life, and high efficiency
are the reasons for the success of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in
different sectors of energy-storage applications. But the limited
global distribution of lithium makes future investment on lithium-ion
battery for large-scale energy-storage systems high.1−3 Considering the cost and limited availability of lithium (20 ppm
in Earth’s crust), more attention has been shifted to the identification
and development of an alternative economically sustainable secondary
battery. In this aspect, sodium is gaining much prominence for large-scale
application in the current scenario due to its high abundance (2.83%
in Earth’s crust and 30.6% in ocean) and low cost. In contrast
to lithium, sodium ions have larger ionic radii (102 pm for Na+ and 76 pm for Li+) and higher redox potential,
thus reducing the energy density.4 The
commercially used graphite anode in lithium-ion battery cannot reversibly
store sodium ions because the formation of the binary graphite intercalation
compound is energetically unfavorable.5,6 Hard carbon
has a disoriented structure and shows a reversible capacity of 300
mAh g–1 when used as an anode in sodium-ion battery.7 But sodium-intercalated hard carbon reacts with
nonaqueous electrolytes reducing the stability of the electrode, which
is a major concern.8 These challenging
factors have increased the need to develop a suitable host material,
which can reversibly store sodium ions with good cyclic stability.

Electrode materials based on the mechanism of alloying like Sn
and Sb show 2–3 times higher specific capacity compared to
intercalation-based materials.9 Among the
alloying-based materials, SnO2 has drawn much attention
because of its high theoretical specific capacity of 667 mAh g–1, chemical stability, and environment-friendly nature.10−14 But SnO2 has slow reaction kinetics with sodium, causing
irreversible conversion reaction, and thus the reversible capacity
arises from alloying reaction alone. The alloying reaction of sodium
with Sn causes huge volume expansion (420%), leading to pulverization
and agglomeration of nanoparticles, resulting in capacity fading.15,16 To alleviate these problems, several strategies have been adopted.
Reducing the size of SnO2 to nanosize can provide a short
diffusion path for the movement of electrons and ions, large electrode/electrolyte
contact area, and more active sites for sodium storage.17−19 Another technique has been employed to enhance the reaction kinetics
where a conductive carbon support is used along with SnO2, which acts as a buffer layer for alleviating volume expansion.19−23 But the use of amorphous carbon as carbon support gives poor rate
capability because of its low electronic conductivity.24 Carbon supports like graphene and multiwalled
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) have excellent electronic conductivity, large
specific surface area, and high mechanical strength. It has been reported
that ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide
(rGO) delivers a reversible specific capacity of 324 mAh g–1 at 50 mA g–1. After 100 cycles at 100 mA g–1, the cell delivers a specific capacity of 369 mAh
g–1.17 Wang et al. demonstrated
that SnO2 quantum dots with graphene aerogel delivers a
specific capacity of 319 mAh g–1 at 50 mA g–1 after 50 cycles.13 They
also reported that SnO2 on MWNTs delivers a specific capacity
of 500 mAh g–1, which is 71% of the theoretical
specific capacity.25 Amorphous SnO2 coated on MWNTs provides an enhanced specific capacity of
630 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1. The
amorphous nature of SnO2 increases the d spacing, which facilitates faster diffusion of sodium ions, thereby
enhancing the reversible conversion reaction of sodium ions with SnO2.19 The combination of reduced
graphene oxide and MWNTs accommodates volume expansion as well as
provides faster reaction kinetics during the alloying reaction. Although
reduced graphene oxide and MWNTs have superior electronic conductivity
and faster reaction kinetics, still some critical issues are not solved.
The electrical contact between SnO2 and carbon support
gets broken due to the repeated expansion and shrinkage of SnO2 during cycling. This leads to capacity decay and poor cyclic
stability. Although the active material determines the energy-storage
capacity, binder and electrolyte also have a major impact on the cyclic
stability and rate capability. The effect of electrolyte and binder
on the performance of metal-oxide/carbon composites in a sodium-ion
battery is less discussed and developed compared to electrode materials.
The commercialization of metal oxides with an effective performance
and stability can only be achieved by selecting the optimum parameters
like electrolyte and binder along with suitable electrode material.
Propylene carbonate (PC) is the most common solvent used in LIB and
sodium-ion battery due to its higher dielectric constant and thermal
stability. But the use of propylene carbonate alone causes the formation
of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, leading to
electrolyte decomposition and capacity fading during cycling.26 Ethylene carbonate (EC) provides a stable electrolyte
interface layer and thus helps in enhancing the cyclic stability of
the electrode. The use of binary solvents improves the ionic conductivity
by enhancing the dissociation of the salt and lowering the viscosity
of the electrolyte. The effect of salt and solvent in the electrolyte
on the performance of hard carbon electrode has been discussed for
sodium- and lithium-ion batteries.27,28 It was found
that the electrolyte solvent remarkably affects the electrochemical
performance of hard carbon anode rather than the electrolyte salts.
Along with the electrolyte, the binder also plays a crucial role for
improving the performance of the battery. Poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(PVDF) is the most commonly used binder because of its good electrochemical
stability and binding capability. The effect of using water-soluble
sodium polyacrylic acid as binder reduces the internal resistance
compared to conventional PVDF binder, thereby enhancing the Coulombic
efficiency and cyclic stability of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes.29

In this work, to provide a good adhesion
as well as electrical
conductivity to SnO2 nanoparticles, an attempt is made
to use hybrid carbon nanostructures of partially open MWNTs (POCNT)
and rGO as the conductive support. This unique morphology of POCNT
with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups attached over the layers
helps to form a suitable intertwined network structure with reduced
graphene oxide. Moreover, this rGO intertwined POCNT network structure
(rGPNT) plays the dual role of accommodating the volume expansion
of SnO2 and as an active material for the sodium-ion storage.
This study also focuses on the experimental insight into the effect
of binder and electrolyte solvent on the rate capability and cyclic
stability. It is found that PVDF binder and PC as the electrolyte
solvent are not suitable for the formation of a stable SEI layer and
subsequent degradation on the performance of the electrode occurs.
The excellent electrochemical performance of SnO2@rGPNT
is obtained with Na-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as binder and EC/diethyl
carbonate (DEC) as the electrolyte solvent with a specific capacity
of 688 mAh g–1 at a current density of 50 mA g–1, which is about 56% enhancement in capacity with
respect to PVDF binder and PC electrolyte.

2 Results
and Discussion
The crystalline structure and the phase purity
of the sample was
determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of rGO, POCNT,
and SnO2@rGPNT are represented in Figure 1. rGO displays a broad peak at 24.5°
indexed to (002) corresponding to exfoliated layers of reduced graphene
oxide. In the XRD pattern of POCNT, a low-intensity peak is observed
at 9.3° corresponding to an increase in the interlayer spacing
of the few outer layers of MWNTs to 0.7 nm. The increase in d spacing is due to the introduction of oxygen functional
groups in the outer few layers of MWNTs. An intense peak at 26°
is also observed corresponding to the C(002) plane with a d spacing of 0.34 nm, which is due to the intact inner core
of the MWNTs that remain unaffected during the process. The intense
diffraction peaks in SnO2@rGPNT located at 26.1, 33.8,
37.7, 51.7, 65.1, and 78.2° can be indexed to the (110), (101),
(200), (211), (301), and (321) planes, respectively, and are assigned
to the tetragonal phase of SnO2 (JCPDS card No. 00-001-0657).
The lattice parameters are calculated to be a = b = 4.738 Å, c = 3.187 Å.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of rGO, POCNT, and SnO2@rGPNT.

Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to determine the
SnO2 loading in SnO2@rGPNT at a heating rate
of 20
°C min–1 in an air atmosphere, as shown in Figure 2a. A mass loss at
100 °C is due to the removal of water molecules present in the
sample. A further mass loss of about 52% occurs at 500 °C due
to the decomposition of POCNT and rGO. The mass loading of SnO2 in SnO2@rGPNT is calculated to be around 48%.
The molecular vibrational characteristics of the sample were determined
by Raman spectral analysis. The Raman spectra of all of the samples
shown in Figure 2b
indicate two major bands: D band around 1330 cm–1 and G band around 1590 cm–1. The G band corresponds
to the characteristic peak of all graphitic carbon material arising
due to E2g symmetry phonon mode, where
the two atoms in the graphene unit cell are vibrating tangentially
one against the other. The D band corresponds to the defects present
in the edges and basal plane of MWNTs. The upshift of G band in POCNTs
(Figure S1) is due to the electron transfer
from the π electron states of MWNTs to oxygen functional groups
during the oxidation process and the strain developed due to the intercalation
of functional groups into MWNTs, which results in the shortening of
the C–C bond.30 The ID/IG ratio defines the defect
concentration in the material. The ID/IG value for rGO, POCNTs, and SnO2@rGPNT are observed to be 1.1, 1.13, and 0.93, respectively. The
defect concentration in rGO and POCNTs is more due to the oxidation
of graphitic structures by the functional groups, which creates the
structural defects. Also, in the case of rGO, the sudden removal of
the functional groups leaves defects in the structure. The defect
concentration in SnO2@rGPNT arises from SnO2 nanoparticles, which get attached over the carbon network causing
disorder in the structure and inducing defects. The downshift in peak
for SnO2@rGPNT is due to the transfer of electrons from
rGPNT to SnO2. This shift also implies that SnO2@rGPNT composite is formed rather than an individual entity.

analysis curves of SnO2@rGPNT;
(b) Raman spectra of rGO, POCNT, and SnO2@rGPNT; (c) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm; and (d) pore size
distribution of SnO2@rGPNT.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm was employed
to study the specific surface area and porosity of SnO2@rGPNT. The porosity and surface area were measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method,
respectively. Figure 2c displays a type IV isotherm, indicating mesoporous structure. The
specific surface area calculated by the BET method is 209.48 m2 g –1, and the total pore volume is measured
to be approximately 0.18575 cm3 g–1.
The distribution of pore size calculated from the BJH plot has a maximum
centered at 2.7 nm. The adsorption–desorption hysteresis indicates
the presence of mesoporous structure. The presence of mesoporous structure
facilitates relatively faster diffusion of sodium ions into the host
structure with low ion-transport resistance.

To further investigate
the chemical composition and oxidation state
of SnO2@rGPNT, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
was carried out. The survey spectrum represented in Figure 3a shows the presence of elements
like Sn, O, and C indicating the purity of the sample. The high-resolution
(HR) spectrum shown in Figure 3b indicates the presence of C 1s and can be deconvoluted into
four peaks located at 285.18, 286.23, 287.19, and 289.82 eV corresponding
to the formation of C=C, C–C, C=O, and C(O)O.
The high-resolution spectrum of O 1s shown in Figure 3c is deconvoluted into four peaks located
at 531.8, 532.9, 533.7, and 534.9 eV. The peak at 531.8 eV belongs
to SnO2, indicating the bond between Sn and O; the other
peak positioned at 532.9 eV is assigned to C=O aromatic groups;
the peak positioned at 533.7 eV is assigned to C–O–C
epoxy groups, and the other peak at 534.9 eV corresponds to C–OH
groups due to the presence of chemisorbed oxygen species. Two peaks
with binding energies of 487.6 and 496.1 eV correspond to Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, as shown in Figure 3d.

1s, (c) O 1s, and (d) Sn 3d.

The specific morphology of SnO2@rGPNT was characterized
by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The POCNTs
intertwined with rGO and SnO2 nanoparticles are distributed
uniformly over the carbon support. SnO2 forms a spherical
morphology with a size range of less than 5 nm. It is well known that
the size of the nanoparticles affects the electrochemical performance
with the smaller particles offering better performance.31 The smaller size of the SnO2 nanoparticles
provides relatively less volume expansion compared to bulk, and the
free space between the SnO2 nanoparticles provides enough
space for buffering the volume changes during sodiation and desodiation
processes. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 4d) is well indexed
to the (110), (101), and (211) planes in the XRD pattern.

Figure 4 (a) TEM image
of SnO2@rGPNT; (b, c) HRTEM images of
SnO2@rGPNT; and (d) SAED pattern of rGPNT.

The electrochemical characteristics of SnO2@rGPNT were
initially evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Figure 5 shows initial four CV curves of SnO2@rGPNT with CMC binder and EC/DEC as the electrolyte solvent
in the potential range of 0.01–2.8 V at a scan rate of 0.1
mV s–1. The first cathodic broad peak around 0.5–0.01
V is due to the decomposition of electrolyte resulting in the formation
of SEI layer on the surface of electroactive material and the irreversible
conversion reaction of SnO2 to Sn. This peak covering a
broad range has disappeared in the further cycles due to the irreversible
and stable nature of the SEI layer formation. In further cycles, the
cathodic peak positioned at 1.04 V is ascribed to the irreversible
conversion of SnO2 to Sn in reaction (1). The cathodic peak at 0.48 V is due to the
alloying reaction of Na with Sn to form NaxSn as in reaction (2). The oxidation peak in the anodic region around 1.2–1.5 V
is due to the reversible dealloying reaction of NaxSn.32 The redox peak around 0.1
V is ascribed to the insertion of sodium ions into the carbon structure.33 To further investigate the electrochemical characteristics
of the electrode in different electrolytes and using different binders,
CV curves are also recorded for CMC PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and PVDF PC,
as shown in Figure S2, which also show
similar behavior. 1   2  Figure 5b shows the first cycle CV
curves of SnO2@rGPNT
in different electrolytes and binders. The irreversible cathodic current
for CMC is lower than that for PVDF, which indicates that CMC favors
the formation of a stable passivation layer on the electrode. The
electrode with PVDF binder and PC as electrolyte solvent shows more
cathodic current due to the rapid decomposition of PC leading to thicker
SEI layer formation.

at a scan ate of 0.1 mV s–1 and (b) first cycle
for different electrolyte and binder.

Figure 6a–d
represents the charge–discharge profiles of SnO2@rGPNT with different electrolyte solvents and binders at different
current densities in the potential range of 0.01–2.8 V. The
charge–discharge profile shows a sloping and plateau region
at low current density. But the plateau region is not obvious in the
further cycles. Due to the irreversible binding of sodium with oxygen,
distinct plateau is not observed in the further cycles. This is the
characteristic potential profile feature of crystalline tin as reported
in previous reports.34,35 After repeated sodiation and
desodiation, the amorphous nature of tin increases, which may not
lead to the obvious plateau region in the charge–discharge
profile.

PVDF PC, (b) PVDF EC/DEC, (c) CMC PC, and (d) CMC EC/DEC; (e) rate
capability; and (f) cyclic stability.

The first cycle Coulombic efficiencies (FCCEs) of SnO2@rGPNT electrodes with CMC EC/DEC, CMC PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and
PVDF
PC are calculated to be 49.61, 43.97, 27.82, and 25.76%, respectively.
The low Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle is due to the irreversible
loss of Na+ ions in the process of SEI layer formation
and the conversion of SnO2 to Sn. This is consistent with
the CV profile shown in Figure 5. The high FCCE of SnO2@rGPNT clearly reveals that
the effective surface passivation occurs with CMC binder and EC/DEC
as the electrolyte solvent. The improved FCCE with CMC binder compared
to PVDF is due to the presence of more carboxyl functional groups
attached to CMC, enabling the formation of effective surface passivation
irrespective of electrolyte solvent. CMC is a linear polymeric derivative
of cellulose with carboxymethyl substitution. CMC provides better
adhesion and dispersion of the electrode slurry. It is already proved
that the −OH group present in the CMC does not contribute to
the irreversible capacity. Therefore, the −OH group present
in the CMC binder does not affect the FCCE. Therefore, the good adhesion
provided by CMC offers better FCCE compared to PVDF36 and hence the CMC binder plays a significant role in improving
the FCCE.

As seen from the charge–discharge curves, the
discharge
capacities obtained at 50 mA g–1 are 688, 478, 580,
and 450 mAh g–1, respectively, for CMC EC/DEC, CMC
PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and PVDF PC. When cycled at 500 mA g–1, the discharge capacities decreased to 278, 100, 92.41, and 1 mAh
g–1, respectively, corresponding to capacity retentions
of 40.4, 20.92, 15.93, and 0.2% compared to the specific capacity
of 50 mA g–1. These results confirmed that the PVDF
binder cannot endure huge volume expansion of the electrode at higher
current density, thereby resulting in the pulverization due to which
a new electrode surface is exposed to the electrolyte and thus SEI
layer is formed continuously. This process results in low capacity
and poor cyclic stability.

Figure 6e displays
the rate capabilities of SnO2@rGPNT. Upon raising the current
density stepwise from 50 to 100, 200, 500 mA g–1, and 1 A g–1, SnO2@rGPNT with CMC EC/DEC
remarkably shows excellent reversible stable capacities of 688, 451,
363, 278, and 113 mAh g–1, respectively, which are
higher than those for CMC PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and PVDF PC. This further
elucidates that better electrochemical performance can be obtained
with the proper selection of binder and electrolyte. Since SnO2@rGPNT with CMC EC/DEC shows better rate capability, the understanding
of the contribution of rGPNT in the composite structure to the specific
capacity is inevitable. In this aspect, rGPNT without SnO2 is evaluated by using charge–discharge studies. Figure S3 indicates the rate capability of rGPNT
with CMC as binder and EC/DEC as the electrolyte solvent. The rate
capability curve shows specific capacities of 214, 156, 122, 102,
and 72 mAh g–1 at 50, 100, 200, 500 mA g–1, and 1 A g–1, respectively. The reversible specific
capacity contribution from rGPNT is about 30%, and the major contribution
of reversible specific capacity is obtained from SnO2 in
the SnO2@rGPNT composite. In rGPNT, the sodium ions are
stored by the process of adsorption into the defect sites as well
as intercalation into the carbon structure. The intertwined structure
of reduced graphene oxide and multiwalled carbon nanotubes acts as
a good conducting support for the uniform dispersion of SnO2 as well as an active material for sodium-ion storage.

Inspired
by the excellent rate capability of SnO2@rGPNT,
the long-term cyclic stability of SnO2@rGPNT in different
electrolytes and binders is further studied at a current density of
200 mA g–1. Figures 6f and 7 represent the cyclic
stabilities of the electrode for 100 and 500 cycles, respectively.
SnO2@rGPNT with CMC binder and EC/DEC electrolyte shows
excellent cyclic stability with capacities of around 280 and 98 mAh
g–1 after 100 and 500 cycles, respectively. When
PVDF is used as the binder, the specific capacities obtained are around
117 and 31 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles for EC/DEC and
PC, respectively. The presence of PVDF around the metal-oxide particles
cannot endure huge volume changes resulting from the process of alloying
and dealloying. Therefore, pulverization of the electrode leads to
the continuous formation of SEI layer, resulting in poor cyclic stability.

Figure 7 Comparison
of cyclic stabilities of SnO2@rGPNT for different
binders and electrolytes.

To further understand the electrode reaction kinetics, cyclic
voltammetry
was carried out in the broad scan rate of 0.1–1 mV s–1 and for CMC EC/DEC, the CV curve is shown in Figure 8a, and for CMC PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and PVDF
PC, the CV curves are shown in Figure S4. The maximum anodic peak current, as shown in Figure 8a, is plotted against the square root of
the scan rate. Their linear relationship shown in Figure 8b indicates the diffusion-controlled
reaction, where the Randles–Sevcik equation is applicable. 3  where Ip is the
peak current; n is the number of electrons transferred; A is the surface area of the electrode; D is the diffusion coefficient; C is the concentration
of Na+ ions in the electrode material; and v is the scan rate. The linear relationship between peak current and
square root of the scan rate indicates that the process is a diffusion-controlled
process. The slope of the linear curve with CMC EC/DEC shows a higher
value compared to CMC PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and PVDF PC, which indicates
higher diffusion of Na+ ions in CMC EC/DEC. This higher
diffusion of Na+ ions in CMC EC/DEC shows better performance,
which is consistent with the rate capability and cyclic stability
curves.

of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mV s–1 and (b)
anodic peak current versus square root of scan rate.

To obtain a better understanding of electrons and
ion transfer
across the electrode/electrolyte interface, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency
range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz at the voltage amplitude of 5 mV s–1. To analyze and compare the electrochemical impedance
in CMC EC/DEC, CMC PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and PVDF PC, EIS was carried out
on the electrodes after 30 cycles. Electrochemical impedance was fitted
with the equivalent circuit, as shown in Figure 9a. The equivalent circuit model consists
of resistance of the electrolyte and ohmic resistance (Rs), surface film resistance (R2), relax capacitance (Q1), charge-transfer
resistance (R3), double-layer capacitance
(Q2), and Na+-ion bulk diffusion
resistance (W3). The Nyquist plot is fitted
using the EC lab software. The equivalent circuit consists of a semicircle
in the high-frequency region and a vertical line in the low-frequency
region. The charge-transfer resistance for SnO2@rGPNT with
PC electrolyte is much higher compared to that for EC/DEC. The continuous
decomposition of PC leads to the formation of a thicker SEI layer,
which provides much higher resistance for the diffusion of ions. This
further confirms the reason behind the enhanced rate capability of
SnO2@rGPNT with EC/DEC electrolyte. The charge-transfer
resistance of SnO2@rGPNT with CMC EC/DEC is low compared
to all other combinations of electrolyte and binder. The mechanical
instability of PVDF leads to the rapid decomposition and has higher
charge-transfer resistance, whereas CMC, which is a cross-linked polymer,
has higher mechanical strength and can endure huge volume expansion
that happens during the process of repeated alloying and dealloying.37

Figure 9 (a) EIS of SnO2@rGPNT with different electrolytes
and
binders and (b) Z′ versus minus square root
of scanning frequency in the low-frequency region.

Further EIS data in the low-frequency region were
used to calculate
the diffusion coefficient according to the following equation 4  where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, A is the area of
the electrode, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration of the sodium ions in the electrolyte,
and σ is the Warburg factor, which can be taken from the slope
of the linear plot of the real impedance versus minus square root
of the frequency. The Warburg factors obtained for PVDF PC, PVDF EC/DEC,
CMC PC, and CMC EC/DEC are 67.31, 146.76, 140.35, and 23.38 respectively.
According to eq 3, the
low Warburg factor gives higher diffusion coefficient. SnO2@rGPNT with CMC as binder and EC/DEC as electrolyte solvent shows
lower Warburg coefficient, which signifies higher diffusion coefficient.
This contributes to the enhanced performance in terms of sodium-ion
storage.

To further understand the SEI layer formation in different
electrolytes
and binders, cross-sectional microscopy images were obtained for the
fresh electrodes as well as for the cycled electrodes. For the electrodes
before cycling, there is no formation of surface films. For the cycled
electrode, there is a formation of surface films on the surface of
the electrode, as shown in Figure 10b,c,e,f. The surfaces of PVDF PC and PVDF EC/DEC after
cycling appear to be rough, which can be due to the decomposition
of the electrolyte during the process of repeated charging and discharging.
In the case of CMC EC/DEC, as shown in Figure 10f, the roughness of the SEI layer formed
is less compared to PVDF PC, PVDF EC/DEC, and CMC PC. This allows
to maintain the structural stability of the electrode even after cycling.
This is due to the fact that the SEI layer formed is thin, which is
highly essential to enhance the better transport of ions into the
electrode by lowering the charge-transfer resistance. This is evident
from the EIS measurement analysis (Table 1), where the charge-transfer resistance is
very less and therefore enhancement in specific capacity is obtained.

The surface of the
fresh electrode and cycled electrode is analyzed
using the SEM images (Figure 11). The surface of the fresh electrode has no thin layer, and
there are few pores observed, which helps in the diffusion of electrolyte
ions into the electrode. After cycling of the electrodes, it can be
observed that there is a formation of a layer on the surface of the
electrode. In the case of PVDF PC, the morphological image shows that
the surface of the electrode is covered by a very thick SEI layer
because there are no pores observed on the electrode surface after
cycling (Figure 11b). This results in an increase in the resistance to the movement
of sodium ions into the electrode material and subsequently results
in low specific capacity and poor cyclic stability. Also, at higher
current density, due to the higher resistance offered by the SEI layer,
the interaction of sodium ions with the electroactive material is
limited, resulting in very poor rate capability. For CMC EC/DEC, the
surface morphology does not show any changes even after cycling. The
formation of thin SEI layer enables better diffusion of sodium ions
and helps in achieving better rate capability and cyclic stability.
The presence of different elements in the SEI layer has been analyzed
by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) mapping, as shown in Figure S2. The presence of different elements
like Na, Sn, O, C, and Cl indicates the formation of SEI layer.

3 Conclusions
In summary, optimized loading of ultrafine SnO2 anchored
on intertwined reduced graphene oxide partially open carbon nanotube
hybrid, synthesized by a simple polyol reduction method, used as anode
in Na-ion battery, provides sufficient specific capacity and rate
capability. The effect of the electrolyte and binder on the specific
capacity and cyclic stability emphasizes that PC electrolyte solvent
and PVDF binder are not suitable for the formation of a stable SEI
layer and retaining the cyclic stability, while the use of Na-CMC
binder and EC/DEC as the electrolyte solvent has a positive impact
on the first cycle Coulombic efficiency and cyclic stability. Besides,
the use of a cross-linked polymer like Na-CMC provides good adhesion
and prevents the collapse of the electrode during the enormous volume
expansion of metal oxides. This work reveals that in addition to the
investigation of the different structural modification of the anode
electrode, further investigation on the electrolyte and binder can
lead to a new direction for the commercialization of metal-oxide-based
carbon composites as anode in sodium-ion battery.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Method of Preparation of
SnO2@rGPNT
Graphite oxide was prepared by Hummers’
method.38 Graphite was oxidized by strong
oxidizing agents
like KMnO4 and NaNO3 in the presence of concn
H2SO4 at ice temperature and stirred for 1 h.
After that, 90 mL of warm deionized (DI) water was added to the above
mixture and stirred for 1 h. To make the mixture more dilute, 292
mL of DI water was added. Then, 12 mL of hydrogen peroxide was added
to remove the unreacted compounds in the mixture. The solution was
filtered, washed several times with DI water until the pH was neutral,
and dried at 60 °C overnight. rGO was prepared by hydrogen reduction
of graphite oxide at 200 °C in an argon atmosphere.39

Partially open multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(POCNTs) were prepared by introducing functional groups on the outer
few layers of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) by Hummers’
method.40 MWNTs were synthesized by the
catalytic chemical vapor deposition technique. Misch metal and nickel-based
AB3 alloy were used as the catalysts for the growth of
MWNTs. The growth of MWNTs was carried out at 700 °C in an argon
atmosphere using acetylene gas as the carbon precursor. The obtained
MWNTs were further air-oxidized at 450 °C in an air atmosphere
and acid-treated with HNO3 to remove amorphous carbon and
metal particles, respectively.41

SnO2@rGPNT was synthesized by dispersing a 1:1 weight
ratio of rGO and POCNTs in a mixture of ethylene glycol and water.
To this solution, 450 mg of SnCl2·2H2O
was added and stirred for 12 h for the uniform dispersion. Then, NaOH
was added to maintain the pH of the solution at 12. The final solution
was refluxed at 120 °C and then filtered, washed, and dried at
80 °C to obtain the final product. rGPNT without SnO2 is obtained by the similar method without the addition of SnCl2·2H2O.

4.2 Material
Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku SmartLab
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418
A°). All measurements were taken in the range of 5–90°
with the step size of 0.02°. Raman spectra were recorded using
a WiTec α Raman spectrometer in the range of 500–3000
cm–1. The laser source used was Nd:YAG (532 nm).
Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out in SDT Q600 analyzer from
TA Instruments in an air atmosphere from room temperature to 1000
°C at a heating rate of 20 °C min–1 with
a flow rate of 160 mL min–1. The surface area and
pore size analysis were done using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument
using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory. To study
the morphology of the samples, high-resolution transmission electron
microscope (HRTEM) images were recorded in a Technai G20 instrument
by drop-casting sample solution in ethanol on holey carbon coated
200 mesh copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was
carried out in a Specs X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Mg Kα
as the X-ray source and PHOIBOS 100MCD analyzer.

4.3 Electrochemical Characterization
The slurry for the
electrode was prepared by mixing 75% of SnO2@rGPNT, 10%
of acetylene black, and 15% of two different binders,
namely, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC), in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and water,
respectively. The working electrodes were prepared by coating the
slurry on copper foil and then dried at 80 °C overnight in a
vacuum oven. The dried electrodes were cut in the form of circular
disks of 12 mm diameter. The typical active material loading was 0.9–1
mg cm–2. 2032-Coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled
glovebox, where the oxygen and moisture levels were maintained below
0.1 ppm. Sodium metal was used as the counter electrode and reference
electrode with glass fiber membrane (Whatman GF/C) as the separator.
The electrolyte used was 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in two different
solvents, propylene carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate/diethyl
carbonate (EC/DEC 1:1 v/v). The cells were galvanostatically cycled
at various current densities between 0.01 and 2.8 V on a Bio-Logic
BCS 810 battery cycler. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on Bio-Logic SP 300.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted by applying
an AC signal of amplitude 5 mV in the frequency range of 10 mHz to
100 kHz. The cyclic voltammetry was carried out in the potential range
of 0.01–2.8 V at different scan rates of 0.1–1 mV s–1.
