We have introduced new niosome formulations
using sucrose monolaurate,
vitamin E and n-octanol as independent additives.
Detailed characterization techniques including turbidity, dynamic
light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, ξ potential,
and proton nuclear magnetic resonance measurements have been introduced
to monitor the morphological transition of the carbohydrate-based
micellar assembly into niosomal aggregates. Moreover, microheterogeneity
of these niosomal aggregates has been investigated through different
fluorescence spectroscopic techniques using a hydrophobic probe molecule
coumarin 153 (C153). Further, it has been observed that vitamin E
and octanol have an opposing effect on the rotational motion of C153
in the respective niosome assemblies. The time-resolved anisotropy
studies suggest that incorporation of vitamin E and octanol into the
surfactant aggregates results in slower and faster rotational motion
of C153, respectively, compared to the micellar assemblies. Moreover,
the ability to entrap a probe molecule by these niosomes is utilized
to encapsulate and deliver the anticancer drug doxorubicin inside
the mammalian cells which is monitored through fluorescence microscopic
images. Interestingly, the niosome composed of vitamin E demonstrated
better cytocompatibility toward primary chondrocyte cell lines compared
to the octanol-forming niosome.

1 Introduction
The
structural and morphological uniqueness of liposomes formed
from phospholipids has created significant interests regarding the
applications in pharmaceuticals and cosmetic industries, microreactors,
soft templates for synthesizing various materials, and also as a model
for the cell membrane.1−10 Therefore, in the last few decades, these phospholipid-containing
liposomes are extensively used as gene and drug delivery vehicles.11−13 Although it is documented that phospholipid vesicles are nontoxic
and can increase the therapeutic effects and drug stability, sometimes
its applicability becomes limited because of the possibility of oxidative
and hydrolytic degradation of phospholipids.14 Moreover, the preparation of unilamellar vesicles using phospholipids
with uniform distribution is comparatively difficult than that of
multilamellar ones.9 Therefore, the utility
of phospholipid–liposomes as the drug delivery vehicle and
models for biological membranes is restricted because of their lack
of physical and chemical stability. Hence, it is of great importance
in the field of science to develop new self-assembled vesicular systems
of alternative building blocks. During the past few years, researchers
have witnessed development of various new nonphospholipid vesicular
aggregates composed of different polymers and surface active agents.15−17 The applicability of micro and nanostructures of vesicular aggregates
depends upon their stability, size, morphology, polydispersity, and
composition. Among all vesicular systems,15−17 the nonionic
surfactant-based vesicles which are well-known as niosomes gain significant
attention because of their unique features over the others. Very often,
niosomes can be considered as a substitute to liposomes.8,18−28 The nonionic surfactant is the main amphiphilic constituent of niosomes.
The niosomal aggregates are more advantageous compared to liposomes
because of their easy preparation procedures, high stability, and
also relatively low cost of the surfactants. The low toxicity, biocompatibility,
and biodegradability of niosomes increase their applicability in drug
delivery. Similar to liposomes, niosomes can effectively bind hydrophobic
molecules in their hydrophobic bilayer and hydrophilic molecules in
their aqueous hydrophilic core, which makes them a promising candidate
in the fields of drug delivery and pharmaceuticals.29−32

Considering the usefulness
of niosomes, in this article, we have
formulated a newly developed niosomal assemblies involving carbohydrate
moiety containing nonionic surfactant sucrose monolaurate with vitamin
E and octanol as additives. Vitamin E (α-tocopherols, α-Toc)
is a fat-soluble essential vitamin with a well-known antioxidant property.
It is situated in the chloroplast envelope, thylakoid membranes in
green plant tissues, and also in the plastoglobuli.33,34 It has been shown that α-Toc is involved in intercepting free
radicals diffusing into the membrane from the aqueous phase.35 In addition to the membrane protective role,
other actions of vitamin E, such as enzyme activation, inhibition
of cell proliferation, and so forth, have been reported.36,37 Vitamin E influences the membrane dynamics and shows strong interactions
in its effects on membrane stability during freezing. Although, there
are several studies regarding effects of vitamin E on the phospholipid
membranes, nothing is known about the role of vitamin E in the formation
of niosomes. On the other hand, the other additive we have used is
a long-chain alcohol, n-octanol, to formulate another
class of novel niosomal aggregates. There are few studies on the effect
of alkanols on the morphology of micelles and phospholipid vesicles.38−42 It has been reported that microstructural transition of aqueous
cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) micelles takes place in the presence of
octanol and inorganic salt, KBr.43 The
molecular dynamics simulation study also suggests that microstructural
alteration of CTAB occurs in the presence of octanol.44

Long-chain alcohol also has a unique effect toward
membrane properties
as mentioned in the literature.39 It has
been reported that the presence of octanol promotes the lipid diffusion
process and also affects the phase behavior of lipids.38 The acyl chain order/fluidity of the membrane
is also affected by the presence of n-alkanol.45 Therefore, the literature reports as well as
the future scopes of octanol-induced morphological transitions have
made us curious to investigate the role of n-octanol
as an artificial vesicle-forming agent for a nonionic amphiphile.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which reveals
the morphological transition of a carbohydrate-based nonionic surfactant
into niosome using vitamin E and octanol as additives. The structural
characterization of niosome formation is systematically monitored
by turbidity, dynamic light scattering (DLS), ξ potential, NMR,
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. UV–vis
spectroscopy and time-resolved anisotropy measurements of a hydrophobic
probe coumarin 153 (C153) have also been carried out to monitor the
dynamic changes that take place in the vitamin E/octanol−sucrose
monolaurate containing niosomal formulations. Therefore, this particular
study may unveil some interesting aspects toward the effect of a vitamin
and octanol into the nonionic amphiphilic assembly. In addition, the
cytocompatibility of these niosomal formulations have been investigated
with primary chondrocyte cell lines. These vitamin E/octanol−sucrose
monolaurate niosomes are utilized to entrap doxorubicin, an anticancer
drug inside mammalian cells which is monitored by fluorescence microscopic
images.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural
Characterizations of Nonionic Surfactant
and Octanol- and Vitamin E-Containing Aggregates
2.1.1 Turbidity Study
The morphological
transition of nonionic surfactant sucrose monolaurate in the presence
of vitamin E or octanol is investigated through monitoring the phase
behavior of various niosome formulations. Here, it is important to
discuss that we have checked with alcohols having shorter chain length
than n-octanol and found that niosome formation takes
place from n-octanol at the experimental condition.
This is supported by the optical micrographs, as shown in Figure S1
of the Supporting Information. Now, with
the incorporation of vitamin E and n-octanol, certain
visual alteration in the phase behavior is monitored. In addition,
we have also measured the turbidity of various niosomal formulations
by monitoring their absorbance at 600 nm. The absorbance of the individual
components including the nonionic surfactant is found to be negligible
at this wavelength (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Hence, the observed variations in turbidity are due to the scattering
of light by the newly formed larger-sized aggregates present in solution.
Actually, there are few literature studies which support the formation
of different large aggregates in the presence of vitamin E derivatives46 and also long-chain alcohols.43Figure 1a,b describes the variation of turbidity of solution mixtures as
a function of vitamin E and octanol concentration, respectively. The
sharp enhancement in turbidity of the solution mixtures indicates
the formation of larger niosomal aggregates.

of (a) sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E- and (b) sucrose monolaurate–octanol-containing niosomes
at different R values.

2.1.2 DLS Measurements
To unravel the
microstructural transition of the sucrose monolaurate micellar assembly
into niosomes with increasing vitamin E or octanol concentration,
DLS measurement has been performed. Figures 2 and S3, (Supporting
Information) represent the intensity–size distribution profiles
of vitamin E- and octanol-containing niosomal aggregates, respectively.
We maintain the concentration of sucrose monolaurate at 10 mM which
is well above its critical micelle concentration as reported in the
literature.47 At this particular concentration,
sucrose monolaurate aggregates as micelles, and the average diameter
of the micellar aggregates lies in the range of ∼5 nm. Interestingly,
in the DLS histogram of the sucrose monolaurate micelle, there is
an intense peak that appears in the larger diameter region, the reason
of which is discussed in the latter section. Briefly, DLS is an intensity-based
measurement technique, and the scattering light intensity (Iscatter) is directly proportional to the sixth
power of the particle diameter (r6). Therefore,
intensity–size distribution DLS profiles are very much sensitive
toward the presence of large particles in the solution, and even if
a trace amount of large particles are present in the solution, they
will be reflected in the DLS profile. However, a remarkable change
in the intensity–size distribution plots is monitored with
the gradual increment of vitamin E and octanol concentrations. The
gradual addition of vitamin E and octanol leads to the formation of
niosomes having a diameter of ∼150–350 nm. Several groups
also reported similar types of size distribution profiles for different
cationic surfactants and cholesterol-containing vesicular aggregates
which also strongly support our results.28,48 The DLS size distribution plots obtained are monomodal, having a
low polydispersity index which suggests that spherical aggregates
are present in the solution. Therefore, from the DLS measurement,
we can successfully conclude that incorporation of vitamin E and octanol
in the sucrose monolaurate micelle leads to micelle-to-niosome transition.

distribution of sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E-containing niosomes at (a) R = 0, (b) R = 0.3, (c) R = 0.5, (d) R = 0.7,
and (e) R = 1.

2.1.3 TEM Measurements
TEM is the direct
evidence for the formation of niosomes with a distinct bilayer. The
TEM images of vitamin E- and octanol-containing niosomes are depicted
in Figure 3a,b and 3c,d, respectively. The size of the vesicles obtained
from the TEM measurement is smaller than that obtained from the scattering
measurement. TEM is the size measurement tool which depends mainly
on the number of the particles, whereas DLS is usually an intensity-based
measurement technique. Therefore, DLS is very sensitive to large particles
(according to Rayleigh’s approximation, intensity is proportional
to r6), and because TEM is a number-based
technique, it will show stronger emphasis of the smallest components
in the size distribution.49

Figure 3 TEM images of unilamellar
niosomes of sucrose monolaurate−vitamin
E (a,b) and sucrose monolaurate−octanol (c,d) at R = 1.

From the TEM images, it is revealed
that the average size of the
spherical unilamellar niosomes is ∼70–100 nm, although
some niosomes having a smaller size distribution also exist. Therefore,
we have successfully demonstrated that individually vitamin E and n-octanol can lead to the formation of niosomes in the aqueous
solution of a carbohydrate-based nonionic surfactant, sucrose monolaurate.

2.1.4 NMR Studies
Further, 1H NMR
measurement has been applied to understand the microstructural
alterations of sucrose monolaurate into niosomes upon interaction
with vitamin E and octanol. The 1H NMR technique helps
to interpret the synergistic interaction between the nonionic micelle
sucrose monolaurate and the two individual additives (vitamin E and
octanol) involved in the formation of various niosomal formulations.
From Figure 4, it is
evident that the NMR peaks corresponding to the protons of the alkyl
chain of sucrose monolaurate are considerably broadened in the niosomal
solutions composed of vitamin E and octanol.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra
of (a) sucrose monolaurate micelle, (b)
sucrose monolaurate−octanol niosome, and (c) sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E niosome. All spectra use the D2O solvent signal at ∼4.8
ppm as a reference. The numberings correspond to the protons of respective
groups of sucrose monolaurate as shown in the figure. The third bracated
portions show the broadening of alkyl chain protons of sucrose monolaurate
due to the formation of niosomes.

It is also monitored that the triplet peak responsible for
the
protons (H4) adjacent to the carbonyl carbon is merged into a single
broad peak as micelles are transformed into niosomes upon interaction
with vitamin E and octanol. Moreover, all protons attached to the
carbohydrate backbone are also broadened significantly. The formation
of rigid self-organized protocell membranes, such as niosomes, renders
the hindered movement and shorter relaxation times of the nuclei which
is manifested in the certain broadening of peaks in the NMR spectra.50 By applying the 1H NMR relaxation
methodology, Villeneuve et al.51 investigated
the morphological transformation of the aqueous mixture of common
cationic and anionic surfactants. Their study revealed that the liquid-crystal-like
nature in the vesicle interior, various curvatures of the bilayered
vesicles, and the induced polydispersity of the vesicular aggregates
are responsible for the broadening of the NMR peaks in vesicular solutions.

2.1.5 Zeta Potential (ξ) Measurements
The surface charge of the vitamin E- and octanol-containing niosomes
is determined by zeta potential (ξ) measurement. The difference
of electrical potential between the dispersion medium and the stationary
layer that exists over the surface of aggregates is termed as ξ
potential. On account of the thermal motion of water molecules, the
dispersion medium is extended from the surface of the aggregates.

The micellar surface of sucrose monolaurate is negatively charged,
and the ξ potential alters sharply with the addition of vitamin
E and octanol into the micellar solution, that is, the ξ value
becomes more negative in vitamin E and octanol-forming niosomal assemblies
at R = 0.3. Moreover, the numerical value of ξ
increases slightly upon further increase in vitamin E and octanol
content. Vitamin E or octanol molecules are neutral, and their incorporation
results in transformation of smaller micellar aggregates into larger
niosomes. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interaction is taking place
between the head group region of sucrose monolaurate and the hydroxyl
groups of the vitamin E and octanol molecules. Hence, a greater number
of surfactant molecules are densely packed in vesicular aggregates
which results in a significant enhancement of the surface charge of
niosomes (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

2.1.6 Steady-State Anisotropy Studies
The micelle-to-niosome transitions of the sucrose monolaurate solutions
are further investigated by the steady state fluorescence anisotropy
measurements. The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of both sucrose
monolaurate–vitamin E and sucrose monolaurate–octanol
solutions with the increasing R value is measured
using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) as a fluorescent probe (Figure
S5, Supporting Information). DPH is a well-known
membrane-bound probe which is widely used to get insight into rigidity
of the membrane.52 For the sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E niosome system, the anisotropy values are increased as micelles
are gradually transformed into niosomes upon increasing the concentration
of vitamin E. This observation clearly indicates that the surrounding
microenvironment of DPH in sucrose monolaurate micelles is less rigid
compared to that in niosomes. The higher the value of anisotropy is,
the higher will be the extent of incorporation of the probe into the
rigid and confined microenvironments of the niosome bilayer taking
place. However, for the sucrose monolaurate–octanol niosomes,
the exactly reverse trend in steady state anisotropy is monitored
with the increasing concentration of octanol. The reduction of anisotropy
values indicates that the DPH molecule is experiencing less rigid
and confined microenvironment in sucrose monolaurate–octanol
niosome compared to that in micellar environment of sucrose monolaurate.
The detailed discussions of the different microenvironments of these
niosomes have been provided in the time-resolved anisotropy measurements
section.

2.1.7 Photophysical Investigation
of a Hydrophobic
Molecule in Sucrose Monolaurate−Vitamin E/Octanol-Containing
Niosomes
2.1.7.1 Steady-State Measurements
The
UV–vis absorption and steady-state emission measurements of
C153 have been monitored in sucrose monolaurate-containing self-assemblies
to investigate the alteration in microenvironments surrounding the
probe molecule as a result of interaction with vitamin E and octanol.

The normalized absorption spectra of C153 in the sucrose monolaurate
micelle, sucrose monolaurate–octanol, and sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E niosomes are shown in Figure 5a. The absorption maximum of C153 in sucrose monolaurate is
431 nm. When vitamin E is incorporated into the carbohydrate-based
nonionic surfactant, the absorption maximum is 10 nm blue-shifted.
On the other hand, in octanol-containing niosomes, the extent of blue
shift is less than vitamin E-containing niosomes. The absorption maximum
is blue-shifted by 4 nm in sucrose monolaurate–octanol niosomes.
The emission maximum of C153 in sucrose monolaurate comes around 538
nm. In sucrose monolaurate–vitamin E and sucrose monolaurate–octanol
niosomes, the emission maxima of C153 are blue-shifted to ∼535
and ∼529 nm, respectively (Figure 5b). This blue-shifted absorption and emission
maxima indicate the inclusion of the hydrophobic probe C153 into the
hydrophobic bilayer of niosomes composed of vitamin E and octanol.
Moreover, the greater extent of blue shifting is the indication of
higher hydrophobicity of the vitamin E–sucrose monolaurate
system compared to that of the octanol–sucrose monolaurate
niosome. Moreover, we have also checked the excitation spectra of
all sets of solutions, and the excitation spectra resemble the absorption
spectra which indicate the purity of the samples (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 Variation in (a) UV–vis
absorption and (b) emission spectra
of C153 in sucrose monolaurate-, sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E-, and sucrose monolaurate–octanol-containing niosomes at R = 1.

2.1.7.2 Time-Resolved
Anisotropy Measurements
The solubilization site of the probe
molecule and its dynamics
in self-organized systems can be regulated by a structural aspect
of different self-assemblies. Therefore, we have monitored the rotational
motion of the C153 molecule in various systems to gain further insight
into the microenvironment of the niosomes.

The anisotropy decays
of C153 during the micelle–niosome transition in different
systems are depicted in Figure 6a,b. In bulk water, the C153 molecule shows a single exponential
decay profile having a rotational time constant of ∼100 ps.52 However, in micellar and niosomal aggregates,
the anisotropy decays become biexponential. The corresponding anisotropy
decay parameters are provided in Table 1.

monolaurate–vitamin
E- and (b) sucrose monolaurate–octanol-containing niosome at R = 1.

a Experimental error of ±5%.

The average reorientation time of
C153 in the sucrose monolaurate
micelle is ∼2.39 ns. The rotational motion of C153 is hindered
as the concentration of vitamin E increases in the aqueous solutions
of sucrose monolaurate. The average rotational time constant of C153
in vitamin E-containing niosome is 2.97 ns. This ensures that C153
is incorporated into the confined and restricted microenvironments
of the niosome because of the morphological transformation of sucrose
monolaurate micelles into niosome upon interaction with vitamin E.
The faster rotational motion of hydrophobic C153 can be justified
by the location and arrangement of the octanol molecule inside the
sucrose monolaurate micellar assemblies. The nonpolar moiety of octanol
is not as long as the hydrocarbon chains of sucrose monolaurate. This
may result in some void spaces between the chains in the bilayer interior
of the octanol-forming niosomes. This type of void formation is reported
for the lipid vesicles in the presence of small amphiphilic molecules.39

Therefore, the probe molecules may rotate
more freely in the octanol-containing
niosomes and hence, there is a decrease in the average rotational
relaxation time. Therefore, the microenvironments of the niosomes
composed of vitamin E and octanol are quite different from each other.

The possible picture of the molecular arrangement has been given
in the following scheme where we can see the difference between molecular
arrangements of the two additives in these two niosomal systems. There
are reports of cholesterol-induced niosome formation where the hydroxyl
group of cholesterol forms hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl group
of Tween 80 and governs niosome formation.29 Similarly, here, the hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl moiety of
vitamin E/ octanol and the carbonyl group of sucrose monolaurate governs
the formation of the niosome. As discussed earlier, the hydrocarbon
chain of octanol is not as long as the nonpolar moiety of sucrose
monolaurate. This may result in some void spaces between the chains
in the bilayer of the sucrose monolaurate–octanol niosome (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Pictorial Representation
of the Molecular Arrangement of Vitamin
E and Octanol in Their Respective Niosomes
The Scheme 1 represents
the pictorial representation of the molecular arrangement of vitamin
E and octanol in their respective niosomes.

However, for vitamin
E, there is no such possibility of void space
formation as the nonpolar hydrocarbon region of vitamin E has almost
similar length with that of sucrose monolaurate. Therefore, the difference
in microenvironments of the niosomes composed of vitamin E and octanol
can be represented as given in Scheme 1.

2.1.7.3 Cytotoxicity Determined
by MTT Assay
To exploit the superior doxorubicin encapsulation
ability of vitamin
E/ octanol−sucrose monolaurate niosomes, one of the prerequisites
is to ensure the cytocompatibility of the niosomes. The cytocompatibility
of the initial micelles and niosomes is studied against mammalian
cells (primary chondrocyte cells) by MTT assay. After 1 h of incubation,
around 97% of the cells remain healthy and alive in vitamin E–sucrose
monolaurate niosomes (Figure 7a). After 3 h of incubation, the absorbance value enhances
for vitamin E–sucrose monolaurate, which indicates that the
normal cell growth is not inhibited in the presence of this particular
niosome system (Figure 7b). However, the absorbance value obtained for octanol–sucrose
monolaurate niosomes is less compared to that obtained for vitamin
E–sucrose monolaurate niosomes in both time scales. Hence,
the vitamin E-containing niosomal system is almost nontoxic for the
cells compared to that of the octanol-forming niosomes. This may be
due to the inherent toxicity of the alcohols toward the cell membrane.53 Moreover, the absorbance value is further reduced
for the sucrose monolaurate micelle which indicates that the cytotoxicity
of these micelles is higher than the vitamin E/octanol−sucrose
monolaurate niosomes.

Figure 7 Cytotoxicity study of the niosomes composed of vitamin
E and octanol
by MTT assay at (a) 1 and (b) 3 h time interval.

In the presence of the sucrose monolaurate system, only 44%
cells
remain alive for the 1 h incubation period. After 3 h, it is further
reduced to 27% which indicates greater cytotoxicity of the sucrose
monolaurate micelle compared to that of the niosomes. This is in correlation
with the previous literature report of the membrane lysis by nonionic
surfactant-forming amphiphiles.54 Thus,
vitamin E–sucrose monolaurate niosomes show substantial cell
viability compared to the octanol–sucrose monolaurate niosomes
and sucrose monolaurate micelles.

2.1.7.4 Cellular
Internalization
Doxorubicin-loaded
vitamin E/octanol−sucrose monolaurate niosomes are incubated
with primary chondrocyte cells for 3 h. These mammalian cells incubated
with niosomes are found to be in natural shape after the incubation
period which indicates the healthy morphology of the cells (Figure 8). Importantly, after
3 h of incubation, the red fluorescence images of the cells confirm
the successful internalization of doxorubicin within the primary chondrocyte
cells. However, the cells remain well-shaped in vitamin E–sucrose
monolaurate niosomes compared to that in octanol–sucrose monolaurate
niosomes. Moreover, in
the presence of sucrose monolaurate incubation, the cell morphology
alters and less spread on the surface. Actually, it is reported that
micelle-forming surfactants induce disordering in cell membranes that
causes lysis of the membrane which has also been observed in life
cells.54,55 However, there are reports of using vesicular
systems for drug delivery purposes in living systems.8,11,29−32 Moreover, cholesterol-based vesicles
have been utilized for cellular transportation. It has been reported
that the cholesterol-derived vesicles are nontoxic for cells, and
the cellular membrane remains intact in the presence of these vesicles.29,30

cells incubated with doxorubicin-loaded (a,b) vitamin E–sucrose
monolaurate niosomes, (c,d) octanol–sucrose monolaurate niosomes,
and (e,f) sucrose-monolaurate micelles for 3 h at (a,c,e) 20×

4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cell nuclei shown
in blue. The 100 and 50 μm scale bars represent 10× magnification
and 20× magnification, respectively.

Our investigation reveals that the cell count is less in
micelles
compared to the niosome-incubated cells, which is also well-correlated
with the MTT assay. Hence, more number of cells are affected in the
case of sucrose monolaurate micelle incubation. However, from the
cell imaging and MTT assay, it is also revealed that the vitamin E-forming
niosomes are cytocompatible and cells are not at all affected. Therefore,
these sucrose monolaurate niosomes, particularly the vitamin E–sucrose
monolaurate niosomes, hold immense potential to be utilized as a cellular
transporter.

3 Conclusion
In summary,
we have developed a novel class of niosomes composed
of a carbohydrate-based amphiphile sucrose monolaurate, where vitamin
E and a long-chain alcohol octanol are the other components. Detailed
characterization of these niosomes has been carried out through DLS,
TEM, turbidity, ξ potential, and NMR measurements. In addition,
the microenvironments of these two different niosomes have been investigated
through monitoring the rotational motion of a hydrophobic probe using
steady-state and time-resolved anisotropy measurements. In both these
steady-state and time-resolved anisotropy measurements, it has been
found that the bilayer of vitamin E-forming niosomes is more compact
and rigid compared to the micelle; however, the opposite trend is
observed for the octanol-based niosomal formulation. We have explained
this contrasting photophysical behavior in terms of the difference
in alkyl chain lengths of niosome-forming components, where shorter
alkyl chain of octanol results in some void spaces between the chains
in the bilayer of sucrose monolaurate–octanol niosomes. More
importantly, this newly developed novel class of niosomes has lesser
cytotoxicity compared to that of the neat sucrose monolaurate micelle.
The ability to entrap dye/probe molecules by these niosomes is used
to entrap doxorubicin inside the mammalian primary chondrocyte cells.
Moreover, the cytotoxicity of the sucrose monolaurate–vitamin
E niosome is lesser compared to the sucrose monolaurate–octanol
niosome and sucrose monolaurate micelle itself. Therefore, the vitamin
E-containing niosomal formulation has potential importance and might
be used for further applications in the pharmaceutical field.

4.3 Cell Culture Using Primary
Chondrocyte Cells
Primary chondrocyte cells were isolated
from rabbit ear according
to the previously described method with some modifications.56 Rabbits were euthanized, and ear samples were
collected thereafter. The samples were initially washed with povidone
iodine solution, and skin layers on ear samples were peeled off. The
tissue was thereafter diced into small pieces and incubated in pronase
solution for 30 min followed by 0.3% collagenase II solution (Gibco)
on a shaker incubator at 200 rpm for 4 h at 37 °C. The digested
tissues were passed through 100 μm cell strainers, and filtered
cell suspension was neutralized and washed. Cells were then pelleted
by centrifugation and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/mL amphotericin
B, and 100 units/mL penicillin. After reaching confluency, the cells
were passaged at a ratio of 1:4 and used in these studies.

4.3.1 Cell Cytotoxicity and Viability Studies
4.3.1.1 MTT
Assay
Cellular cytotoxicity
was measured by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay. In a 12-well plate, 104 cells/well were
seeded and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, followed by the addition
of samples at a concentration of 10 mM. After 1 and 3 h of incubation
with samples, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and incubated in 0.5 mg/mL MTT solution at 37 °C for 4
h. To dissolve the formazan crystals thus formed, dimethyl sulfoxide
was added and stirred, and absorbance was recorded at 595 nm on a
microplate reader on the plate screen (RMS, Chandigarh, India).57

4.3.1.2 Doxorubicin Loading
and Cellular Studies
Dox loading was performed by incubating
niosomes in 1 mg/mL of
Dox solution overnight. Because of the hydrophilic nature of Dox,
it preferentially accumulates in the inner aqueous core of the niosomes.
After preparation, the Dox-loaded niosome aqueous suspension was stored
in dark atmosphere at 4 °C and later used for further fluorescence
experiments in cells.

For fluorescence studies, in a 12-well
plate, 104 cells/well were seeded and incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h, followed by the addition of samples at a concentration of
10 mM. After 3 h of incubation with samples, the wells were washed
with PBS and stained using DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following
the manufacturer’s protocol.57 An
Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) was used for capturing
images.
