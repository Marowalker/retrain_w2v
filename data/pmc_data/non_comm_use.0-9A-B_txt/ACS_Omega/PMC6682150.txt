Adsorption
of the single water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface with
and without the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ was analyzed utilizing the density functional theory method.
Our results demonstrate that the optimal adsorption configuration
of the single water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface lies
in the bridge being configured with two formed hydrogen bonds. These
were Os–Hw and Hs–Ow (s and w represent, respectively,
surface and water molecules), while the main hydrogen bond is Hw–Os.
Furthermore, the corresponding adsorption energy was ∼−72.60
kJ/mol. In this study, the presence of metal ions helped to deflect
the spatial position of the water molecule, and the distance between
Ow and Hs was altered significantly. Furthermore, the charge transfer
between the interacting atoms increased in the presence of metal ions,
wherein the effects of Ca2+ and Na+ proved to
be significant compared to Mg2+. Finally, it emerged that
metal ions interacted with the water molecule and were subsequently
adsorbed on the α-quartz (001) surface. This occurred due to
the electrostatic attraction, consequently impacting the hydration
characteristics of the quartz surface.

Introduction
Water molecules are
adsorbed on the hydrophilic mineral’s surface (e.g., quartz
and clay minerals) and arranged in a certain order which is referred
to as mineral hydration. This process plays an important role in colloidal
chemistry,1 wastewater treatment,2 and mineral processing.3 For instance, with highly muddied coal slurry containing a large
amount of hydrophilic quartz and clay mineral particles, slurry’s
sedimentation and dewatering becomes more difficult owing to mineral
hydration.4,5 The reason for this is the strong hydration
repulsion and stereohindrance effect being produced and making the
dispersion system stable.6−9 For this reason, the mineral surface hydration characteristics
have emerged as the critical aspect of solving problems dealing with
how to treat coal slurry.

Mineral hydration in aqueous solution
has been extensively studied using SFA,10,11 X-ray diffraction,12,13 transmission electron microscopy,14 NMR,15,16 atomic force microscopy (AFM),17 and
other experimental methods.18−22 Referring to the hydration model, Manciu et al.23,24 proposed a polarization strategy, wherein an “ice-like”
hydration layer structure appeared on the quartz surface in aqueous
solution. The mineral’s hydration layer is characterized by
its elasticity and strength, and the water molecules in this region
have larger density and viscosity when compared to bulk water.25−28 The thickness of the hydration layer on the silica surface was measured
using two methods, namely, viscosity29 and
AFM.30 It was reported that the hydration
layer thickness of the clay mineral varied in the ∼0–50
nm range.

Density functional theory (DFT) is an effective theoretical
tool for calculating the mineral structure and its surface adsorption,31−33 and the first-principles calculation method based on DFT can analyze
the interaction mechanism of the mineral surfactant34,35 and mineral water36,37 at the molecular/atomic level.
For example, Liu et al.38 reported that
the hydration layer of a mineral can prevent direct adsorption of
ether amine, dodecylamine ethoxylate (AC1201) ether and DDA on the
mineral surface. Peng et al.39 have employed
the periodic DFT method to document the adsorption mechanism of water
on sodium-montmorillonite (001) basal and (010) edge surfaces. The
atomic structure, preferred adsorption sites, adsorption energies,
and vibrational frequencies for water adsorption on the α-quartz
(101) surface have been investigated by Bandura et al.40 They noted that the structure of water adsorption
on the α-quartz (101) surface was defined by the comprehensive
effect of the interactions involving water–water, water–silanol,
and silanol-silanol hydrogen bonds. The hydroxylated surfaces were
stabilized by weak hydrogen bonds that were evident between the silanol
groups and surface-bridging oxygens.

Generally, metal ions are
commonly found in flotation pulp and coal slurry. With that, the activation
mechanism of quartz by Ca(II) was revealed in the atomic level using
the DFT method. It was reported that the Ca(OH)+ ions can
repulse the hydration shell and consequently adsorb on the quartz
surface; the Ca(OH)+ ion acts as a bridge between the α-quartz
(101) surface and α-Bromolauric acid (CH3(CH2)9CHBrCOOH, a-BLA).41 Despite the fact that water molecules’ adsorption on the
minerals’ surface is generally understood, the effects of various
metallic ions (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, etc.) on the quartz surface remain largely unexplored. This requires
further investigation and consequently, in this paper, we have undertaken
a systematic theoretical study on the adsorption characteristics of
a single water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface with and
without the presence of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. It has been done employing the periodic DFT method. The
frontier orbital analysis, adsorption configurations, adsorption energies,
Mulliken atomic charges, the partial densities of states (PDOSs),
and the electron transfer are presented and discussed in this research
study.

Results and Discussion
Frontier Orbital Analysis
The frontier
orbital theory42 asserts that the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) are the most reactive. In Table 1 mentioned below, the orbital energy and
HOMO–LUMO gap (ΔE, calculated by eq 1) of the reactants are
summarized. 1  where  and  represent the orbital energy of
the water molecule. Similarly, EHOMOα-quartz(001) and ELUMOα-quartz(001) are the orbital energy of the α-quartz surface.

Table 1 Frontier Orbital Energy and HOMO–LUMO Gap (ΔE) between the Water Molecule and α-Quartz (001) Surface
 	frontier
orbital energy/a.u	HOMO–LUMO gap/a.u	
 	HOMO	LUMO	ΔE1	ΔE2	
H2O	–0.238205	–0.010765	0.16575	 	
α-quartz (001)	–0.28325	–0.07246	 	0.27248	
According to the frontier orbital theory, the smaller
the ΔE is, the stronger is the interaction.
ΔE1 < ΔE2 indicates that the electrons of the HOMO orbital of
the water molecule were transferred to the empty LUMO orbital of the
α-quartz (001) surface. It can therefore be predicted that the
adsorption of the water molecule on the quartz surface is due to the
interaction between the hydrogen atoms of the water molecule and the
oxygen atoms of the α-quartz (001) surface. The frontier orbital
properties of the water molecule and the α-quartz (001) surface
are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. It is evident that the HOMO orbital of the water
molecule appears on the oxygen atom, while the LUMO orbital of the
α-quartz (001) appears on both hydrogen and oxygen atoms located
on the surface.

Figure 1 Frontier orbital analysis of the water molecule (a) and
α-quartz (001) surface (b). The isosurface value are 0.02 and
0.05 electrons/Å3, respectively.

Considering the periodicity and symmetry of the optimized
α-quartz (001) surface, the adsorption sites of the individual
water molecule on the quartz surface were predicted. One hollow (H),
five top (T), and eight bridge (B) adsorption sites (the dotted line
and real line are symmetrical) were considered, according to the number
of possible hydrogen bonds as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Initial adsorption sites of the water molecule
on the α-quartz (001) surface.

Adsorption Energies and Configuration
Using the following
formula below, the adsorption energies (Eads) of the water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface were
calculated 2  where ET is the total
energy of the water and the α-quartz (001) surface. EW is the energy of an isolated water molecule. EQ is the energy of the α-quartz (001)
surface.

The adsorption energies (Eads) of the water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface at different
initial positions were calculated using eq 2 and plotted as a function of different positions
as illustrated in Figure 3. It can be seen that the Eads of the water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface range
from −16.46 to −72.60 kJ/mol; a similar amount of adsorption
energy (−75.8 kJ/mol) was documented by de Leeuw et al.43 The strong interaction between the water molecule
and the quartz surface is indicated here.

the single water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface at different
initial positions.

The optimal adsorption
configuration of the single water molecule on the quartz surface is
illustrated in Figure 4. In this present study, the interacted atoms of the water molecule
and quartz surface were Hw, Ow, and Hs, Os, respectively. It is observed
that the water molecule was vertically adsorbed on the α-quartz
(001) surface. The optimal adsorption site (i.e., the hydrogen atom,
Hw and oxygen atom, Ow of the water molecule interacting with the
adjacent oxygen atom, Os and hydrogen atom, and Hs on the nearby quartz
surface, respectively) of the water molecule on the α-quartz
(001) surface was found at initial position B 6.

Charge Analysis
The electron density difference and Mulliken charge populations were
investigated to discover the adsorption mechanism of the single water
molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface. Figure 5 depicts the electron density difference
of the adsorption system of the water molecule on the α-quartz
(001) surface. In the plot of electron density difference, the blue
and yellow regions between two atoms represented the accumulation
and depletion of electrons, respectively. It appears that a significant
charge was transferred between the water molecule and adjacent atoms
of the α-quartz (001) surface. The electrons were transferred
from the hydrogen atoms of the water molecule to the α-quartz
(001) surface.

Figure 5 Electron density difference of the optimal equilibrium
configurations of single water adsorbed on the α-quartz (001)
surface; (a) top view; (b) side view. The isosurface value is 0.02
electrons/Å3.

The Mulliken charge analysis was conducted on the atoms directly
involved in the adsorption of the water molecule on the α-quartz
(001) surface, and results are summarized in Table 2. From Table 2, it can be observed that the 1s state of the hydrogen
atom (Hw) of the water molecule lost 0.03e while
interacting with the oxygen atoms (Os) on the α-quartz (001)
surface. In contrast, the hydrogen atom (Hs) of the α-quartz
(001) surface lost 0.04e during the interaction with
oxygen atoms (Ow) of the water molecule. Meanwhile, the oxygen atom
(Os) of the α-quartz (001) surface and the oxygen atom (Ow)
of the water molecule obtained the corresponding electrons. Based
on this observation, it can be concluded that the hydrogen bond is
responsible for adsorbing the water molecule on the α-quartz
(001) surface.

Figures 6 and 7 illustrate
the PDOS of the interaction atoms between the water molecule and the
α-quartz (001) surface in the optimal equilibrium configuration.
The zero point denoted Fermi level EF.
It can be seen in Figure 6 that the energy of Os 2p has a negative shifting tendency
during the water molecule adsorption process. Bonding effects were
evident in the region of −10 ≤ energy/eV ≤ −5
(Figure 6) and −8
≤ energy/eV ≤ −5 (Figure 7) for Hw 1s and Os 2p, and Hs 1s and OW 2p,
respectively. Hence, the existence of the hydrogen bond (Ow–Hs)
and (Os–Hw) between the water molecule and the −OH group
of the α-quartz (001) surface was observed (see the insets of Figures 6 and 7). The peak intensity ratio of Hw 1s (Figure 6) was found to be larger when compared to
the Hs 1s at −6.4 eV, which indicates that the Os–Hw
hydrogen bond was stronger.

Effect of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ on the Charge Transfer and
Adsorption Configurations
Based on the optimal adsorption
configuration of the individual water molecule on the α-quartz
(001) surface, metal ions were added to the system. The objective
here was to investigate the effects of metal ions on the hydration
of quartz. It is noted that the simulation parameters were chosen
based on the results of water molecule adsorption on the quartz surface.
The electron density difference of the water molecule and α-quartz
(001) adsorption systems in the presence of different metal ions,
namely, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ are shown
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Initial adsorption
position (a), adsorption equilibrium position (b), and electron density
difference (c) of water molecule adsorption on the α-quartz
(001) surface in the presence of Na+, Mg2+,
and Ca2+ (the isosurface value is 0.02 electrons/Å3).

It can be seen in Figure 8 that the charge transfers
and spatial position between the interacted atoms of the water molecule
and quartz surface changed in the presence of metal ions. Although
no significant electron accumulation or depletion between the Na+ and the adjacent atoms occurred, what did occur was the phenomenon
of electron transfer between Mg2+, Ca2+, and
oxygen atom of the water molecule. This happened due to the electrostatic
interactions. It is worth noting that the distance (1.598 Å)
between Ow and Hs (shown in Figure 4) has been significantly increased (∼8.39 to
77.78%) in the presence of metal ions, namely, 1.732 Å (Mg2+), 1.734 Å (Na+), and 2.841 Å (Ca2+). In contrast, the distance (1.688 Å) between Hw and
Os slightly decreased in the presence of metal ions, specifically
1.629 Å (Na+), 1.674 Å (Mg2+). This
changed to 2.504 Å when Ca2+ was present.

The
spatial position of the water molecule appeared to be deflected. The
adsorption energies in the presence of Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ became, respectively, −172.56, −131.32,
and −173.36 kJ/mol. From this it can be stated conclusively
that in the presence of Na+ and Ca2+, the adsorption
system become more stable, and furthermore the interaction of the
water molecule with the surface proved to be stronger. This in turn
promoted hydration of the quartz surface and demonstrated that the
influence of Mg2+ is weaker than that of Na+ and Ca2+.

In the presence of metal ions, the Mulliken
charge population of the atoms in the adsorption system is shown in Table 3. The analysis shows
that the Hs 1s state interacts with the Ow and lost (0.00–0.04)
electron, while the Hw 1s state lost (0.07–0.10) electrons
when metal ions were present. In contrast, the Mulliken charge population
of the Os revealed no significant changes before and after the adsorption
of the water molecule. The water molecule obtained a few electrons,
and the Ow 2p state gained (0.01–0.05) electrons. In the presence
of metal ions, the charge transfers (0.04–0.07e) between interacted atoms in the adsorption system were found to
be larger than that (0.00–0.40e) without metal
ions. The electrons were transferred from the water molecule to the
α-quartz (001) surface, causing the quartz surface to become
negatively charged. The positively charged metal ions and negatively
charged quartz surfaces were adsorbed and this was explained by the
electrostatic attraction. The adsorption of metal ions on the surface
of the quartz enhanced the interaction between the water molecule
and the surface, while the adsorbed metal ions connected the water
molecule and surface. Subsequently, these actions promoted hydration
of the quartz surface.

Conclusions
This study investigated the effects of metal ions, specifically
Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ on the adsorption
of the single water molecule on the α-quartz (001) surface.
To do this, the DFT method was employed. The main findings of the
present study are summarized below:

(1) The DFT calculation
results show that the adsorption energies of the single water molecule
on different initial positions of the α-quartz (001) surface
ranged from −72.60 to −16.46 kJ/mol, and the corresponding
adsorption energy of the optimal adsorption configuration was −72.60
kJ/mol. The water molecule spontaneously formed two hydrogen bonds
(i.e., Hw–Os and Hs–Ow) with the surface to adsorb on
the α-quartz (001) surface.

(2) In the presence of metal
ions, the spatial position of the water molecule is deflected, revealing
a tendency to move away from Hs and closer to Ow. The Ow–Hs
lengths change from 1.598 to 1.734, 1.732, and 2.841 Å in the
presence of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+,
respectively. Meanwhile, the Hw–Os lengths (1.688 Å) change
to 1.629, 1.674, and 2.504 Å. The main hydrogen bonding effect
is Hw–Os. It appeared that the adsorption systems became stronger
in the presence of Na+ and Ca2+, while a relatively
weak promotion comes from Mg2+.

(3) The surface hydration
mechanism of the α-quartz (001) surface occurs mainly through
the adjacent water molecules which are adsorbed on the quartz surface
by forming hydrogen bonds. Metal ions interact with the quartz surface
via electrostatic interaction, subsequently influencing the adsorption
of the water molecule and surface hydration characteristics.

Computational
Methods
Models
In quartz, the silica tetrahedra are bonded
in the three-dimensional framework. Each tetrahedron is bonded to
four other tetrahedra (with an oxygen atom shared at every corner
of each tetrahedron). The geometric optimization of the quartz primitive
cell was conducted and the results are summarized in Table 4. Compared with the previous
simulations44,45 and experimental46 results, the α-quartz lattice parameters obtained
in this simulation are comparable to the experimental values.

Unlike many brittle crystals, α-quartz does
not possess perfect crystallographic planes of cleavage, and the (001)
surface emerges as the most stable surface as predicted by both interatomic
potential48 and DFT methods.43 While the fresh α-quartz (001) surface
is easily hydroxylated in aqueous solution, the top and side views
of the hydroxylated α-quartz (001) surface are shown in Figure 9a,b, respectively.
The periodic supercell (2 × 2 × 1) was used with a vacuum
thickness of 10 Å to avoid the interaction between the adjacent
levels.

Computational Details
DFT calculations were implemented in the CASTEP program (Materials
Studio version 8.0 software, Accerly Corporation).49 Electron exchange and correlation were described using
the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function of the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA).50 The interaction
between valence electrons and the ionic core was described by the
ultrasoft pseudopotential,51 and the valence
electron configurations considered in this study were H 1s1, O 2s22p4, Na 2s22p63s1, Mg 2s22p63s2, and
Ca 3s23p64s2.

The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
(BFGS) algorithm52 helped to optimize the
atomic positions. The Tkatchenko–Scheffler van der Waals correction
method53 was employed to correct density
functional calculations for the missing van der Waals interactions.
With computation accuracy and efficiency being taken into account,
the kinetic energy cut-off for the plane wave basis was set to 400
eV, and the symmetrized Brillouin zone was obtained with a 2 ×
2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid according to a series of convergence
tests (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Regarding other calculations, the tolerances of energy, force,
stress, and displacement were 1.0 × 10–5 eV/atom,
0.05 eV/Å, 0.05 GPa, and 0.001 Å, respectively.

Finally,
the Dmol3 module was employed to calculate the frontier
orbital of water and quartz. In other words, after optimization in
CASTEP, the frontier orbital energy could be obtained by calculating
the optimized unit cell with single-point energy and Gamma point (K-point) in DMol3. The parameters selected were
shown as follows: exchange correlation function GGA-PBE, effective
core potential and DNP basis set, fine precision, and convergence
standard of the self-consistent field 1.0 × 10–6 eV/atom.
