In this article, we have investigated
the unusual dynamics of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA)–water
and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)–water binary
mixtures using solvation
dynamics as a tool. For this purpose, femtosecond transient absorption
spectroscopy has been employed. Although these two molecules are isosteres
to each other, a significant difference in water dynamics has been
observed. The solvation times in TBA–water binary mixtures
are found to be between 1.5 and 15.5 ps. On the contrary, we have
observed very fast dynamics in TMAO–water binary mixtures (between
210 and 600 fs). Interestingly, unusual retardation in dynamics is
observed at 0.10 mole fraction of TBA and TMAO in both the binary
mixtures.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, small amphiphilic molecules have gained a lot
of attention from the researchers because of their fascinating behavior.
For example, the molecule tert-butyl alcohol (TBA)
does not favor the folded state of protein;1,2 whereas
its isostere trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) stabilizes
the native state.3−5 Another amphiphilic molecule dimethyl sulfoxide acts
as a protein stabilizer in an aqueous binary mixture below the mole
fraction of 0.15. After this concentration, an opposite effect has
been observed.6 Therefore, the structural
features of different amphiphiles and their extent of interactions
with the solvent molecules are very much important to predict their
behavior. Considering the two small organic molecules TBA and TMAO,
both have the same hydrophobic composition (i.e., three methyl groups).
On the contrary, TBA contains a tertiary butyl group, and TMAO has
an N-oxide moiety in their hydrophilic counterparts (Scheme 1). In spite of this small difference,
the aqueous solution behavior of the two molecules is quite different.
Previous literature reports have suggested self-aggregation of TBA
molecules in dilute aqueous solutions; however, TMAO does not exhibit
a similar tendency.7,8 It is reported that TMAO forms
an aggregate with water by strong hydrogen bonding.8 In a word, the solution behavior should depend on the type
of aggregation (i.e., TBA–TBA or TMAO–water).

Scheme 1 Chemical
Structures of the Materials Used in This Study
TBA–water binary mixtures have been extensively
investigated
by several groups using different techniques. Initial attempts, based
on the “iceberg” model developed by Frank and Evans,
clathrate-hydrate formation with water, and so forth, have been taken
to explain the nonideal behavior.9,10 However, recent
neutron diffraction and small-angle neutron scattering experiments
have pointed out the association of TBA molecules in TBA–water
binary mixtures.11−17 Several molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have predicted
the aggregation tendency of TBA molecules.18−24 It has been reported that the aggregation behavior of TBA depends
on the applied force fields and the size of simulated systems.25 They have used four force fields to simulate
TBA–water binary mixtures; two of them agree in favor of TBA
aggregation. Using all the four force fields, they have observed demixing
of TBA molecules above 0.1 mole fraction of TBA. However, TBA is soluble
in water at any concentrations. Recently, Ben-Amotz and Rankin have
observed the absence of hydrophobic contacts in alcohol–water
binary mixtures.26,27 Shirota and Castner have reported
the nonideal behavior of aqueous 1-propanol binary mixtures between
0.15 and 0.25 mole fraction of propanol by measuring the solvation
dynamics of coumarin 153.28 Biswas and
co-workers have found saturation in the activation energy for the
conversion of the locally excited state (LES) to the charge-transfer
state [of 4-(1-azetidinyl)-benzonitrile] at 0.10 mole fraction of
TBA.29 In a recent study, we have shown
the anomalous slowdown in solvation dynamics between 0.09–0.15
and 0.40–0.46 mole fractions of TBA in TBA–water binary
mixtures.30 These two specific regions
are completely correlated with the Bagchi and co-workers’ MD
simulation work.22,24

On the other hand, neutron-scattering
experiments have suggested
that 2–3 water molecules are strongly hydrogen-bonded to one
TMAO.31 Mid-infrared femtosecond spectroscopy
has been used to predict the immobilization of four water molecules
by every methyl group of TMAO.32,33 The orientational dynamics
of comparatively immobile (around the hydrophobic group of TMAO) hydroxyl
groups of water are 4 times slower than the mobile one (i.e., bulk
like). Interestingly, the reorientation time of mobile hydroxyl groups
decreases with the increasing TMAO concentration. This is probably
due to the TMAO-induced increased network defects of water.33 Similar slowdown is found in the spectral and
orientational dynamics of HDO in aqueous TBA and TMAO solutions.34 Therefore, they have concluded that at low concentrations
of the two solutes, the hydrophilic part does not play any role in
the water dynamics. On the contrary, using the MD simulation study,
Hynes and co-workers have not observed the slowing down of water motion.35 Ab initio MD (AIMD) and force field MD simulations
have been employed to unravel the effects of TMAO on the reorientational
dynamics of D2O. Interestingly, they have found that AIMD
simulation is the right method to predict the slowdown of reorientational
dynamics of D2O because of the formation of the strong
O–D···OTMAO hydrogen bond. However,
the force field model cannot predict the actual scenario because of
the inability to account for a specific directionality of the hydrogen
bond.36 In the TMAO–water mixture,
water molecules do not get a chance to denature the protein because
of their involvement in solvation of TMAO.37 It is reported that TMAO forms TMAO·2H2O or TMAO·3H2O complexes with water.38 On the
other hand, it is suggested that TMAO does not have any significant
effect on the water structure.39 The same
group has also suggested the association of TMAO molecules in aqueous
solution. On the contrary, Raman and infrared spectroscopy experiments
have not found the aggregation propensity of TMAO molecules.8,40−42 Rather, the evidence for the TMAO–water complex
has been provided by terahertz and Raman spectroscopy.43,44

Although a lot of individual studies have been performed on
TBA–water
and TMAO–water systems, comparative information from the experimental
background is very few.8,45−48 Using heterodyne-detected vibrational
sum frequency generation spectroscopy, the preferential orientation
and expulsion/accumulation of TMAO and TBA molecules in the air–water
interface have been detected.45 They have
found that TMAO is preferentially excluded from the air–water
interface and remains at the water layer just below the interface.
On the other hand, TBA is preferentially accumulated in the interface
maintaining the “methyl-up” orientation. In a recent
study, Nagata and co-workers have shown that TMAO is present near
the air–water interface.46,47 A similar observation
is also reported using MD simulations.48 In addition, TMAO induces a change in the angular distribution of
the O–H group of water in the interface. Solvation dynamics
is an important spectroscopic technique to measure the dynamic response
of solvent molecules. Several groups have studied the solvation dynamics
in binary mixtures and in neat solvents using different ultrafast
measurements such as time-correlated single photon counting and fluorescence
upconversion,30,49−57 femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy,58−64 two-dimensional infrared,58 nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy, and so forth.65 In this article, we have investigated the solvation dynamics of
TBA–water and TMAO–water binary mixtures up to 0.20
mole fraction of both solutes (TBA and TMAO) through femtosecond transient
absorption measurements. For this purpose, coumarin 343 (C343) is
used as a solvation probe. It has been observed that the timescales
of water dynamics in TBA–water and TMAO–water systems
are between 1.5–15 ps and 200–600 fs, respectively.
Interestingly, we have found the retardation of solvation dynamics
at 0.1 mole fraction of both solutes. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report on the solvation dynamics of TBA–water
and TMAO–water binary mixtures using femtosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Steady-State Absorption and Emission Studies
The steady-state
UV–visible absorption spectra of C343 in
TBA–water and TMAO–water binary mixtures are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively.
In water, the absorption maximum of C343 is centered at 428 nm. With
increasing TBA content up to XTBA = 0.10,
we have observed a red shift (up to 451 nm) in the absorption maximum.
After this concentration, a blue shift is found up to XTBA = 0.20 (445 nm). A similar result is obtained in the
case of TMAO–water binary mixtures [red shift up to XTMAO = 0.10 (445 nm) and after that blue shift
up to XTMAO = 0.20 (438 nm)]. We have
plotted the absorption maxima of C343 as a function of TBA and TMAO
concentrations in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). On the other hand, the emission maximum of C343 in water is 490
nm. With increasing TBA and TMAO contents, we have observed a red
shift in the emission maxima (Figure 1c,d). However, the extent of the red shift in TBA–water
binary mixtures (490–501 nm) is greater than that in the TMAO–water
system (490–494 nm).

and (b) TMAO–water binary mixtures. Fluorescence spectra of
C343 in (c) TBA–water and (d) TMAO–water binary mixtures.

Therefore, the UV–visible
absorption results indicate that
at XTBA,TMAO = 0.10, the solution behavior
is different from other concentrations (Figure S1). However, we have not found a similar behavior in the steady-state
emission spectra. Sen and co-workers have found the composition-dependent
steady-state absorption behavior of the DCM dye in chloroform–methanol
binary mixtures.62 However, a similar behavior
was absent in the steady-state emission spectra. Again, the composition-dependent
behavior comes into picture in solvation dynamics measurements. Our
observation is very much similar to their study. They have explained
the composition-dependent absorption behavior in terms of synergistic
solvation (probe molecules are solvated by the combined component
of solvents in binary mixtures). However, the ground-state solvation
structure becomes destroyed because of the generation of large dipole
moment upon excitation, and as a result, disappearance of excited-state
synergism has been observed. This means that the synergism disappears
slowly during the course of relaxation and vanishes completely at
the relaxed state (RS) (steady-state emission). We can follow up the
time-resolved relaxation process by studying the solvation dynamics.
Therefore, we can verify whether the ground-state solution structure
at XTBA,TMAO = 0.10 affects the relaxation
dynamics or not.

2.2 Solvation Dynamics Study
in TBA–Water
and TMAO–Water Binary Mixtures
In this section, we
would like to discuss the water dynamics in TBA–water and TMAO–water
binary mixtures in detail. For this purpose, we have recorded femtosecond
transient difference absorption spectra (TDAS) of C343 in TBA–water
and TMAO–water binary mixtures with the increasing solute concentration
up to XS = 0.20 at a regular interval
of XS = 0.02 (XS represents the mole fraction of the solute). TDAS between 350 and
650 nm at XTBA = 0.06, 0.10, and 0.18
and XTMAO = 0.06, 0.10, and 0.18 are shown
in Figure 2a–c,d–f,
respectively. In each plot, TDAS at different delay times (time between
pump and probe) are shown by using various colors. Cyan lines correspond
to the TDAS at negative delay time, that is, the signal is not generated.
As reported earlier, we have observed three bands in the transient
signal of C343. Two excited-state absorption bands (positive signal)
have been found between 350–400 nm and above 600 nm. Between
this region, the bleach component from 400 to 600 nm consists of the
ground-state bleach (GB) and induced fluorescence [stimulated emission
(SE)]. The bump at around 460 nm is responsible for the GB. The band
at the red side is for the SE.66 As it
is reported that during the solvation process, a red shift is observed
only in the SE band for coumarin derivatives, and it is very easy
to monitor the SE signal of C343 for solvation calculations. To differentiate
the phenomena between fluorescence and SEs, we have collected transient
absorption spectra of C343 in the TBA–water system at 0.10
mole fraction of TBA [Figure S2, Supporting Information]. Below the zero delay condition (the probe pulse is followed by
a pump pulse), we have observed fluorescence signals (inset of Figure S2) with a very small amplitude (−0.003).
On going from −0.5 to 0.5 ps, an SE band is generated with
an amplitude of −0.078. The amplitude of the SE band is 26
times greater than that of fluorescence.

Figure 2 Femtosecond TDAS of C343
in TBA–water [(a) XTBA = 0.06,
(b) XTBA = 0.10,
and (c) XTBA = 0.18] and TMAO–water
[(d) XTMAO = 0.06, (e) XTMAO = 0.10, and (f) XTMAO = 0.18] binary mixtures [pumping wavelength: 415 nm].

Now, we explain the mechanism of solvation dynamics
in brief. When
C343 is excited using a pump pulse, this excitation causes redistribution
of electronic charges within the molecule. As a result, there is a
huge increase in the dipole moment on going from the ground state
to the excited state. As soon as the dipole is created, the solvent
molecules start to rearrange themselves around the newly formed dipole.
We have successfully monitored this relaxation process by using white-light
continuum (WLC) probe pulses and observed that two states are involved
in the solvent relaxation process: that is, the LES (observed at very
short delay time) and the RS (observed at long delay time). As the
TDAS produce time-resolved spectra directly, we do not need to construct
them like in other techniques. Additionally, nonemissive states can
be detected using TDAS. These are the advantages of TDAS over the
time-resolved fluorescence technique. By measuring the SE emission
signal of C343, Cole has performed the solvation dynamics of C343
in aerosol-OT reverse micelles.67

In our system, at XTBA = 0.06 (Figure 2a), the SE band appears
from 100 fs, and the maximum of this band is ∼470 nm. With
increasing delay time, we have observed a red shift in the SE signal,
and the maximum reaches to ∼491 nm (RS). The red shift continues
up to the delay time of 43.2 ps. Note that the maximum of the SE band
(491 nm) at 43.2 ps delay time exactly matches with the steady-state
emission maxima [Figure 1c]. This is an indication of complete relaxation. On the other hand,
at XTBA = 0.10 and 0.18 (Figure 2b,c), the maxima of the SE
band have been found ∼450 nm (LES) at a delay time of 100 fs.
Similar to XTBA = 0.06, we have observed
a red shift in the SE band up to 116 and 67.8 ps for XTBA = 0.10 and XTBA = 0.18,
respectively. In all the three cases, the red shift with increasing
delay time is an indication of solvation dynamics. The difference
between XTBA = 0.06 and XTBA = 0.10 and 0.18 is that the fastest excited-state
relaxation occurs in the former case (complete relaxation within 43.2
ps) than the other two cases (116 and 67.8 ps). The slowest relaxation
is observed at XTBA = 0.10. On the other
hand, the red shift completes within 3–4.9 ps for all mole
fractions of TMAO in TMAO–water binary mixtures (Figure 2d–f). Only in the case
of XTMAO = 0.10, the red shift continues
up to the delay time of 4.9 ps. In other regions, a similar shift
saturates within 3–3.5 ps. This indicates faster water dynamics
in TMAO–water binary mixtures compared to the TBA–water
system.

To get quantitative information about the solvation
dynamics in
these two binary mixtures, we have determined the maxima of the SE
signal as a function of time. From these data, we have plotted the
solvent correlation function C(t), expressed by the following equation 1  where ν(0), ν(t), and
ν(∞) are the peak frequencies of the SE band
at time zero, an intermediate time, and infinity, respectively. The
solvent correlation functions are fitted by using biexponential or
triexponential functions depending on the nature of plots.62 A triexponential function C(t) is expressed as 2  where τ1, τ2, and τ3 are the solvation
times with amplitudes
of a1, a2,
and a3, respectively. Solvent correlation
functions at different mole fractions of TBA and TMAO in TBA–water
and TMAO–water binary mixtures are shown in Figure 3a,b and c,d, respectively.
From the individual time components of solvation dynamics and their
relative contributions, we have calculated the average solvation time
τs using the following equation. 3

0.10, 0.14, and 0.18] and TMAO–water [(c) XTMAO = 0.04 and 0.10 and (d) XTMAO = 0.10 and 0.18] binary mixtures.

Solvation parameters in TBA–water and TMAO–water
binary mixtures are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
It is reported that the major portion of solvation dynamics of C343
in neat water completes within 50 fs.67,68 Maroncelli
and co-workers have observed the two time components (126 and 880
fs) of C343 in water.68 From Table 1, we have observed that with
the increasing TBA concentration, one long-lifetime component is generated
having a lifetime of 15–50 ps. The contribution of this component
increases from 10 to 25% on going from XTBA = 0.06–0.10. After XTBA = 0.10,
the lifetime as well as the contribution of this component decreases
up to XTBA = 0.16. Again at XTBA = 0.18 and 0.20, another long-lifetime component having
a lifetime of 16–23 ps appeared. As the binary mixtures are
complicated systems, instead of explaining individual components,
we have discussed our results on the basis of the average solvation
time. We have observed that the average solvation time in TBA–water
binary mixtures is between 1.5 and 15.5 ps with a maximum at around XTBA = 0.10 (τs = 15.35 ps).
On the other hand, in TMAO–water binary mixtures, the average
solvation times are between 210 and 600 fs (Table 2). The lifetimes of fast components are between
90 and 120 fs which completely correlated with the previous study.68 Interestingly, the long component lifetime increases
from 0.95 to 1.48 ps from XTMAO = 0.08–0.10.
At XTMAO = 0.12, and it reaches to 1.68
ps (nearly 2 times of the long component of neat water). It is to
be noted that the water–water hydrogen bond lifetime is increased
3.8 times in the presence of 1 M TMAO.69 The contribution of this (long) component also increases from 19
to 31% from XTMAO = 0.06 to 0.12. We have
obtained the highest solvation time between XTMAO = 0.10 and 0.12. Although the average solvation times
are significantly different for both the systems, we have observed
retardation of water dynamics at around XTBA,TMAO = 0.10.

Recently, we have
reported the retardation of solvation dynamics
between XTBA = 0.09–0.15 and XTBA = 0.40–0.46 in TBA–water binary
mixtures using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion measurements
of coumarin 480 (C480).30 In this study,
we have also observed the slowdown in solvation dynamics at around XTBA = 0.10 using femtosecond transient absorption
measurements of C343 (Figure 4a). Additionally, at around XTBA = 0.10, the average solvation time is almost similar for two cases
(18.8430 and 15.35this study ps). This observation indicates that the solvation dynamics of the
TBA–water system is independent of the probe and measurement
techniques. To see whether there is any effect of C343 on the dynamics
of the TMAO–water system, we have employed a different dye,
C480. We have measured the transient absorption spectra of C480 in
the TMAO–water binary mixture (at XTMAO = 0.10) [Figure S3, Supporting Information]. Similar to the case of C343, a red shift in the SE band is observed
with increasing probe delay. The red shift saturates at 4.75 ps. In
C343, similar saturation occurs at 4.9 ps. Therefore, the dynamics
of the TMAO–water system is probe-independent.

vs mole fraction of (a) TBA and (b) TMAO.

Generally, solvation dynamics are related to physical observables
(viscosity, thermodynamics, etc.). Thermodynamic properties exhibit
deviation from the ideal behavior at 0.04 mole fraction of TBA.30 The viscosity of the binary mixture reaches
a maximum at around XTBA = 0.40.30 However, there is no report of a similar deviation
at XTBA = 0.10. Therefore, the retardation
of the solvation time at XTBA = 0.10 is
not related to the physically observable. The possible explanation
for this slowdown at XTBA = 0.10 is the
structural transition induced by TBA aggregation from the waterlike
network to the alcohol-like zigzag structure. Biswas and co-workers
have shown the structural transition from the waterlike tetrahedral
network to the zigzag alcohol-like structure at around XTBA = 0.10 in TBA–water binary mixtures.29,70,71 It has been reported that with
the increasing TBA concentration, aggregation tendency increases and
reaches its maximum in the range of XTBA = 0.14–0.17.72 The aggregation
of TBA molecules at around XTBA = 0.10
is further supported by other groups.19,73 Hence, our
result is completely in line with the other reports. Therefore, the
long-lifetime component of 15–50 ps is probably responsible
for large TBA clusters. On the other hand, similar slowdown in solvation
dynamics is also found at XTMAO = 0.10–0.12
in TMAO–water binary mixtures (Figure 4b). Several groups have reported the formation
of strong hydrogen bonds between the O–H group of water and
the OTMAO atom.36,38,47 Therefore, this strong hydrogen bond reduces the number of free
water molecules that are available to hydrate the biomolecules.37,47 Thus, TMAO can act as a stabilizer of protein. Indra and Biswas
have shown that long hydrogen-bond fluctuation lifetime is because
of the strong TMAO–water interaction.74 Interestingly, TMAO stabilizes the compact state of a polymer up
to 1 M concentration; after this concentration, it exerts an opposite
action.75 This observation indicates that
TMAO is unable to form a strong hydrogen bond with the water molecules
after a certain concentration and thus destabilizing the compact state
of the polymer. Using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, one slower
relaxation mode is found at a 4 M concentration of TMAO (XTMAO = 0.10).38 Sudden increase
in the lifetime as well as in the contribution of slow solvation component
between XTMAO = 0.10 and 0.12 indicates
that the TMAO–water complexes become most stable, and this
reduces the availability of free water molecules to slowdown the relaxation
process. After this concentration, the TMAO–water complexes
may not remain intact. As a result, the dynamics become faster again.
Therefore, we feel that our probable explanation of observed composition
dependence of the TMAO–water system is in complete correlation
with the previous literature report.

Interestingly, on going
from XTBA =
0.02 to 0.04, we have observed a decrease in the average solvation
time (Table 1). The
contribution of the fast component increases from 51 to 75%. It is
reported that aggregation of TBA excludes nearby water molecules to
the bulk. As a result, the polarity increases and the solvation time
decreases.71 Several thermodynamic properties
of aqueous TBA exhibit deviation from the ideal behavior at XTBA = 0.04.76 It
should be mentioned here that in our previous study, we have identified
this region by measuring the solvation dynamics using the “spectral
reconstruction method”. However, the “single wavelength
measurement method” could not detect it.30 Therefore, to extract the solvation information, the TDAS
method is more accurate and time-saving than the time-resolved fluorescence
measurements.

To further corroborate our results, we have fitted
the experimental
decay curves obtained from TDAS measurements. We have chosen a particular
probe wavelength (550 nm) and fitted the data for TBA–water
and TMAO–water systems at XTBA,TMAO = 0.10.30 Experimental decay curves have
been fitted using an exponentially decaying function, ∑iAi exp(−t/τi), convoluted with an instrument response function (τi and Ai are the decay times of individual components and their corresponding
contributions, respectively). Fitted decay curves are shown in Figure 5a,b. From fitting,
three time constants obtained at XTBA =
0.10 are 0.60 ps (0.25), 5.7 ps (0.35), and 41.4 ps (0.40). On the
other hand, the values for XTMAO = 0.10
are 0.15 ps (0.82), 2.25 ps (0.17), and 15.6 ps (0.01). It has been
reported that the three time components of C343 in ethanol are 100–300
fs, 3 ps, and 28 ps.66 These are attributed
to the solvation time scales. In our case, the timescales of C343
are completely correlated with the previous literature report. There
are the two methods available in the literature to calculate the solvation
time (spectral reconstruction and single wavelength method). In the
“spectral reconstruction” method, fluorescence transients
of a probe are measured at different emission wavelengths in a particular
medium using the fluorescence upconversion technique. Time-resolved
emission spectra (TRES) can be obtained by proper fitting of fluorescence
transients. One can calculate the solvent correlation function [C(t)] (this provides solvation timescales)
with the help of TRES. In the “single wavelength” method,
the timescales of a single wavelength transient can successfully represent
the solvation dynamics of a system. In our previous studies, we have
shown that the results of “spectral reconstruction”
and “single wavelength” measurement methods agree with
one another.30,57 In this study, we have tried
to correlate the solvation times of both the systems calculated through
the “spectral reconstruction” method (by measuring the
red shift in the SE band) with the time constants of a 550 nm transient.
Discussion regarding the choice of the single wavelength is given
in our earlier publication.30,57 Interestingly, we have
found a nice agreement between the timescales of the two methods.
In addition, the results of “single wavelength” fitting
provides a similar dynamical trend with the information of the “spectral
reconstruction” method (the dynamics of the TBA–water
system is much more retarded compared to the TMAO–water system
at Xsolute = 0.10). We have shown in our
earlier study that although the timescales of the two methods are
different, they can provide a similar dynamical trend.30 Therefore, we feel that in this study, the result
of the “spectral reconstruction” method is completely
corroborated by the information from “single wavelength”
fitting.

0.10.

The aggregation of TBA
molecules creates a tremendous heterogeneity within the solution.
As a result, we have observed a massive slowdown (greater than 25
fold) in the solvation dynamics compared to its isosteric response.
Irrespective of the timescales of solvation dynamics, we have observed
deviations from the ideal behavior in both the binary mixtures. According
to the ideal behavior, any solution property should change linearly
between two neat solvents.62 However; we
have observed deviation at 0.10 mole fraction of both solutes. These
deviations exactly match with the results of absorption measurements
(see Figure S1). Therefore, the ground-state
solution structure clearly affects the relaxation dynamics and completely
disappears at RES. The difference in dynamics between these two systems
is due to different hydrophilic groups of two isosteric molecules.7 Sen and co-workers have reported synergistic
solvation (combined component of solvent participates in solvation
dynamics) in hydrogen bond-donating and hydrogen bond-accepting solvent
pairs (binary mixture).62,77 If one of the components
of the binary mixtures has no hydrogen bond-donating or hydrogen bond-accepting
groups, the mechanism of solvation is preferential (probe molecule
is solvated by a particular solvent). As both of our systems (TBA–water
and TMAO–water) contain hydrogen bond-donating and hydrogen
bond-accepting solvent pairs, we feel that the mechanism of solvation
is synergistic in our case.

It is very much important to provide
a connection between our two
studies (present study and ref (30)). Several MD simulation studies have reported the self-aggregation
of alcohol molecules in alcohol–water binary mixtures.18−24 However, Patey and co-workers have pointed out the force field-dependent aggregation
behavior of alcohol molecules. This study motivates us to perform
a thorough investigation of the TBA–water system experimentally.
In a comparative study, we have shown that the aggregation tendency
of TBA is more prominent compared to ethanol (as the dynamics of the
TBA–water system is slower than that of the ethanol–water
system).

Previously, we have studied the dynamics of two self-aggregated
systems.30 TBA and TMAO show very different
behaviors in terms of their aggregation in water and toward the vapor–water
interface.7,47,48 In view of
their (TBA vs TMAO) very different behavior to the stability of proteins,
it is very interesting to investigate the water dynamics.2,4 We have tried to probe the solvation dynamics of TBA–water
and TMAO–water binary mixtures using the fluorescence upconversion
technique [Figure S4, Supporting Information]. For this purpose, we have collected fluorescence upconversion
traces of C343 for XTBA = 0.10 and XTMAO = 0.10 (maximum retarded regions) at two
different emission wavelengths (530 and 510 nm). In the TBA–water
system, a significant rise component (signature of solvation dynamics)
is observed at the red-end side of the emission spectrum (Figure S4a,b). However, the dynamics of the TMAO–water
system is very fast, and rise components are not at all clear (or
very small contribution, Figure S4c,d).
It is very difficult to construct the solvent correlation function
[C(t)] by measuring the wavelength-dependent
fluorescence of C343 in the TMAO–water system using fluorescence
upconversion [the cross-correlation measured between the second harmonic
and the fundamental had a full-width at half-maximum of 300 fs]. On
the other hand, transient absorption spectroscopy (pulse width 50
fs) directly measures the time-dependent emission spectra of C343
in the TMAO–water system, and we have successfully resolved
the difference in dynamics at XTMAO =
0.10 (time-dependent red shift in the SE spectrum saturates at 4.9
ps) with the other regions (the same shift saturates between 3 and
3.5 ps). To compare this result (TMAO–water system) with that
of the TBA–water system, we have re-investigated the system
(TBA–water) with transient absorption spectroscopy. Interestingly,
the dynamics of the TBA–water system measured through two different
ultrafast techniques agree with one another and indicate the slowdown
in the solvation response at XTBA = 0.10
within a window of XTBA = 0.0–0.20.
In view of this good agreement between the two methods, we feel that
transient absorption spectroscopy provides interesting dynamical information
about the TMAO–water system (which is not possible using fluorescence
upconversion measurements) and also makes it possible to compare the
TBA–water and TMAO–water binary mixtures.

Solvation
dynamics is an important tool to probe the dynamics of
binary mixtures.28,30,53,55,57,62 In contrast to the literature debate, the similar
dynamical results of the TBA–water system between our two studies
and a nice dynamical comparison between TBA–water and TMAO–water
systems (this is not possible using fluorescence upconversion techniques)
are the novelties of our work.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, unusual dynamics of TBA–water and TMAO–water
binary mixtures have been investigated using solvation measurements.
We have observed that the solvation response in TMAO–water
binary mixtures is much faster than that in the TBA–water system.
Interestingly, retardation in solvation dynamics has been found at
0.10 mole fraction of both the solutes. TBA aggregation-induced structural
transition and formation of TMAO–water complexes are the probable
reasons for this retarded solvation dynamics at 0.10 mole fraction
of TBA and TMAO.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Laser-grade C343 and C480
are bought from Exciton. Spectroscopic grade TBA and TMAO are purchased
from Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd. and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Triple-distilled
Milli-Q water is used to prepare TBA–water and TMAO–water
solutions. We have maintained pH 7 for all solutions. Scheme 1 represents the chemical structures
of all the materials used for this experiment.

4.2 Instruments
and Methods
Steady-state
UV–vis and fluorescence measurements are performed using a
Shimadzu (model UV 2450) UV–vis spectrophotometer and a Hitachi
(model no. F-7000) spectrofluorimeter (wavelength resolution is 0.5
nm), respectively. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements are
carried out with a commercially available transient absorption spectrometer
from Newport Corp. For this experiment, a Ti:sapphire (Coherent Inc.,
Libra) regenerative amplifier laser system is used as the main laser
source. The output of the regenerative amplifier is centered at 808
nm, at a repetition rate of 1 kHz with an average pulse energy of
3 mJ and a pulse width of 50 fs. The whole beam is split into two
parts by a 70/30 (R/T) beam splitter.
The major portion of the beam is used to generate a pump beam at 415
nm from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime, Light Conversion).
A small portion of the fundamental beam is allowed to pass through
a computer-controlled motorized delay stage (Newport Corp, ILS-LM)
and is used to generate a WLC probe beam with a spectral range of
350–850 nm by focusing it onto a 3 mm CaF2 crystal.
Pump and probe beams are focused on the sample with spot sizes of
210 and 80 μm, respectively. Maximum time delay that can be
achieved between the pump and the probe is 3 ns. After passing through
the sample, the WLC probe is collected by a fiber-coupled spectrometer
with an Si photodiode array (Oriel Instrument, MS-260i). Samples are
kept in a cuvette of path length 1 mm for measurement, and they are
continuously stirred with a magnetic stirring system. A block diagram
of the instrument is provided in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information).
