Phages are bacterial viruses that
have gained a significant role
in biotechnology owing to their widely studied biology and many advantageous
characteristics. Perhaps the best-known application of phages is phage
display that refers to the expression of foreign peptides or proteins
outside the phage virion as a fusion with one of the phage coat proteins.
In 2018, one half of the Nobel prize in chemistry was awarded jointly
to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter “for the phage
display of peptides and antibodies.” The outstanding technology
has evolved and developed considerably since its first description
in 1985, and today phage display is commonly used in a wide variety
of disciplines, including drug discovery, enzyme optimization, biomolecular
interaction studies, as well as biosensor development. A cornerstone
of all biosensors, regardless of the sensor platform or transduction
scheme used, is a sensitive and selective bioreceptor, or a recognition
element, that can provide specific binding to the target analyte.
Many environmentally or pharmacologically interesting target analytes
might not have naturally appropriate binding partners for biosensor
development, but phage display can facilitate the production of novel
receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against toxic
or nonimmunogenic targets, making the technology a valuable tool in
the quest of new recognition elements for biosensor development.

Introduction
Bacteriophages, or phages for short, are bacterial viruses that are
abundant in nature but harmless to humans. Their role as the main
regulators of the microbial balance among the diverse variety of bacteria
existing in the ecosystem makes them naturally eminent, but, owing
to many interesting characteristics, phages have also become an exceptional
tool for many biotechnological applications.1 The Greek origin of the name bacteriophage describes them as “bacteria-eaters,”1 although perhaps more aptly they can be defined
as parasites that are capable of infecting bacteria.2 Upon infection, the phage takes over the biosynthetic machinery
of the host cell to replicate its genetic material and subsequently
produces more than a thousand identical phage particles.3

Naturally, a myriad of different phages
exist, but, generally,
each phage particle, or virion, encloses its genome of DNA or RNA
in a protein coat, or capsid.4 Phages are
ubiquitous in nature, highly specific to bacteria, and, in addition,
are extremely robust and can withstand even harsh conditions.1 They can be classified based on their morphology,
their life cycle, and ways to propagate.1 Lytic or productive phages, such as T4, T7, T3, and MS2 phages,
are only capable of replicating their genome, assembling the phage
virions, and releasing them by lysing and killing the host cell.4,5 Lysogenic or temperate phages, such as λ phage, can multiply
via lytic cycle or incorporate their genome into the host cell genome
where it will produce a quiescent state.5 Filamentous phages, characterized by their long rodlike shape, are
lysogenic phages that do not lyse their host cell but secrete the
newly assembled virions and continue the process. Filamentous phages
can infect a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria, for example, Escherichia coli. The most used phages include M13,
fd, and f1 phages, all belonging to the Ff class, so named because
they infect the bacterial host via the tip of the F conjugative pilus.6

M13 is one of the most used phages for
sensing applications,7 and it consists
of a circular single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) genome packaged within the phage particle, a somewhat
flexible protein cylinder of about 930 nm in length and 6.5 nm in
diameter.5 The filamentous capsid consists
of the phage structural proteins, the major coat protein (pVIII),
which appears in approximately 2700 copies alongside the virion, and
the minor coat proteins, capping both ends of the phage, pVII and
pIX on one end and pIII and pVI on the other (Figure 1A,B).5,8 The pIII is the largest
and structurally most complex of the phage proteins, and it is essential
for the infectivity because of its role in the binding to the bacterial
pilus and is necessary for the termination of the viral assembly.
The remaining six phage proteins are involved in viral replication
and assembly.6 M13 can infect E. coli by the attachment of the pIII to the pilus,
which is encoded by the bacterial genes carried on the F-factor. After phage binding, the pilus retracts until the phage
reaches the bacterial surface and pIII can bind to the membrane proteins
and transfer the phage genome into the host cell.

Figure 1 (A) Structure of filamentous
phage M13 which consists of a protein
coat made of the major coat protein (pVIII) and the minor coat proteins
(pIII and pVI on one end and pVII and pIX on the other). The genomic
DNA encoding for the coat proteins is enclosed within the protein
coat. By introducing modified segments into the genomic DNA, the phage
can be engineered to display foreign peptides or proteins as a fusion
with one of the coat proteins, most commonly pIII. (B) Transmission
electron micrograph of the filamentous phage M13 acquired with negative
staining using a JEOL JEM-1400PLUS instrument operating at 120 kV,
with a LaB6 electron source and a GATAN US1000 CCD camera (2k ×
2k). (C) Construction of phage-displayed libraries includes generation
of the DNA library encoding for the different variants and introduction
of the variable sequences in the phage DNA (typically a phage vector
or phagemid system). After transforming the DNA to bacteria, phages
are amplified and will display an individual protein or peptide variants
outside the virion.

Subsequently, the infecting
phage disassembles and the coat proteins
insert into the bacterial membrane. Once inside the bacterial cell,
the phage genome is converted to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by bacterial
enzymes and synthesis of new phage protein begins. Newly synthesized
proteins finally assemble around the ssDNA genome and extrude from
the bacterium. As a nonlytic phage, M13 does not kill the host cell
and the infected host continue growing and dividing.5,8

The phage structure and its mode of replication have contributed
to making phages a valuable tool for biological research.5 Because of the natural assembly of phage virions,
they are rapid and straightforward to produce even in large quantities
in bacteria and they are fairly easy to purify in high yields.6 Modifying the phage genome is relatively simple
as foreign DNA sequences can be inserted into the nonessentials regions
of the genome, making it a useful cloning vehicle in biotechnology.

Principles
of Phage Display
Phage display refers to the expression of
peptide or protein variants
on the surface of the phage virion by cloning the corresponding encoding
gene as a fusion with one of the phage coat proteins (Figure 1).5,9 This
technique has been recognized as a powerful tool to screen and select
binders on the basis of molecular recognition from phage-displayed
libraries, assemblies of about 10 billion of phage clones each harboring
a different variant of the displayed entity.6

Filamentous phages are the most common ones used for phage
display
because they are rather ideal for inserting various-length DNA segments
into the genome that is relatively small in size and accommodates
well such modifications. Moreover, cloning and construction of fusions
are facilitated by the possibility of isolating both ssDNA and dsDNA.
Being nonlytic, filamentous phages do not kill the host cell but can
be amplified in high quantities.10 On the
other hand, one of the drawbacks of using M13 for phage display is
that owing to the nonlytic propagation all of the compounds of the
virion must be exported through the bacterial inner membrane prior
to the phage assembly. Occasionally, this has been a limitation for
displaying large proteins whose size, sequence, or folding might prevent
the translocation or disrupt the integrity of the capsid. In principle,
this limitation can be obviated by using lytic phages, such as icosahedral
T4 and especially T7, which assemble entirely in the cytoplasm.11,12

Nevertheless, based on filamentous phages, numerous display
systems
have been developed using different coat proteins for the display
together with phage or phagemid vectors. These phage display systems
can be more specifically classified according to the arrangement of
the coat protein genes, which in the end affects the display valency,
i.e., whether the foreign peptide or protein is displayed on all or
only part of the copies of the coat proteins.2 The N-terminus of pIII was the first location used for the display
of a foreign peptide,13 and it is still
the most commonly used, although all five capsid proteins have been
used to this aim.6,10 The major coat protein, pVIII,
can be used for both N- and C-terminal fusions, but only short peptides
(six to eight residues) can be displayed without disturbing the phage’s
ability to replicate. Fusion with pVIII will typically lead to multivalent
display with even thousands of copies, whereas lower valencies, usually
one to five copies per phage, can be obtained with pIII fusions.

Commonly, phage display is based on operating either on phage or
phagemid vectors.14 In the phage vector
display, the foreign DNA sequence to be displayed is cloned into the
phage genome fused with the gene of one of the coat proteins. As a
result, the phage will express the foreign entity, peptide or protein,
as a fusion with the coat protein. In some cases, for example, if
the size of the target is too large, such display may interfere with
the phage assembly and the phagemid system is preferred. Phagemids
are phage-derived vectors that do not encode for all of the structural
and functional proteins of the phage but carry only the necessary
replication origins and one kind of coat protein that is used for
the display. Phagemid usually contains an antibiotic resistance gene
and two origins of replication, a plasmid replication origin that
allows them to replicate in a high copy number in the host cell and
a filamentous phage replication origin that is activated once the
phagemid-bearing cell is superinfected with the helper phage. Thus,
the phagemid by itself can replicate within a bacterial cell and maintain
itself as a plasmid, but it is not able to finish the assembly of
phage particles independently. Only when a helper phage vector containing
the genetic elements for phage packing is present, the host cell harbors
both the phagemid and the helper phage genome, and thus, phage particles
can be produced. In fact, superinfection results in two types of infective
virions, particles carrying the helper phage DNA and particles with
the phagemid DNA.6,15

Generally speaking, the
phagemid vectors are preferred, especially
when displaying entire proteins or antibody fragments. As the size
of the phagemid is considerably smaller than that of the phage vector,
they are easier to manipulate, maintain, and propagate, and they usually
allow higher transformation efficiencies and improved genetic stability.
Moreover, cloning is relatively simple in comparison with phage vectors
that have a somewhat complex structure with overlapping genes, promoters,
and terminators.10 In addition, the phagemid
system is required if a monovalent display is desired. Nevertheless,
the phagemid system requires an additional infection with a helper
phage to provide all of the proteins needed to make ssDNA and new
virion particles.8 The helper phage usually
has a modified packing signal to favor the packing of the phagemid,16 and further modifications can allow, for example,
multivalent display or inhibition of wild-type phage infection with
trypsin-cleavable pIII display.17,18 The tryptic helper
phage (KM13) is sensitive to trypsin and loses its infectivity when
incubated with this protease. Therefore, trypsin treatment after the
selection can eliminate the majority of the helper phages that do
not display the foreign peptide of interest. In other words, only
those phages carrying the fusion protein can maintain their infectivity
and continue to propagate in the bacterial host.5,6

Phage-Displayed
Libraries
Peptide Libraries
Phage-displayed libraries are made
of billions of phage clones, each one carrying a different foreign
DNA insert and therefore displaying a unique peptide or protein sequence
on its surface (Figure 1C).2 The foreign DNA sequence coding for
the displayed entity can be derived from a natural source, or it can
be deliberately designed and synthesized chemically.6

The use of peptide libraries is perhaps inferior
to antibody libraries, but nevertheless, they have been widely used
for various applications, for example, for epitope mapping,19 immunotherapy,20 antiviral
research,21 vaccine development,22 and protein–protein interaction studies.23 Moreover, peptides can provide information about
interactional motifs, epitopes or binding sites of antibodies and
other proteins. Phage-displayed peptides can also be useful intermediates
in the development of small-molecule drugs.24 Remarkably, peptides can be isolated against almost any protein
target, including, for example, antibodies, enzymes, receptors, transcription
factors, and protein interaction domains.6 Experience has shown that peptides identified by phage display commonly
bind to protein functional sites rather than randomly or nonspecifically
to the surface of the target. Such binding sites are often grooves
or depressions in the protein surface with exposed hydrophobic groups,
making them suitable for specific target binding.6 If the peptide binds to the functional site of the target
protein, it will also most likely inhibit binding of others to the
same site. Taking advantage of this feature peptides have been used
as surrogate ligands in a variety of competition-based assays for
drug discovery.6 Similarly, antibody binding
peptides have been applied as epitope mimics in competitive immunoassays.25

Many peptide libraries are made by joining
the DNA sequences coding
for the peptide directly into the phage genome at, or near, the N-terminus
of gIII. As a result, potentially five copies of peptide–pIII
fusions are displayed at one end of the phage particle. Fusion to
the gVIII can result in more than 2000 copies of the peptide per phage.
It should be noted that as the strength of the binding is defined
not only by the affinity of the interaction but also by the avidity,
i.e., the overall strength of the binding, which is affected by the
number of binding sites, may have substantial effects.1 Thus, the multivalent nature of the display will have significant
avidity effects and potentially low-affinity binders might end up
selected due to the high avidity.24 The
size of the peptide is limited in such systems but can be increased
if a phagemid system is used. Moreover, the phagemid system allows
reducing the avidity effects by a monovalent display. The diversity
of peptide libraries, in terms of the number of distinct peptide sequences,
is usually limited by bacterial transformation efficiency. Typically,
the diversity of peptide libraries vary between 107 and
109 phages. Thus, the size of completely randomized peptides
(for example, 20 different codons, at n different
positions) is limited to n = 6–8. Despite
these limitations, also longer peptides, although incomplete in terms
of nucleotide randomization, have been used to construct libraries
with sufficient variability.2,24

Random peptide
libraries can be derived by oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis from “degenerate” oligonucleotides that
are synthesized chemically by adding mixtures of nucleotides to a
growing nucleotide chain.2,6 Random peptide libraries
can be described as naïve, in the sense that they are designed
to be as unbiased as possible and, thus, they can provide specific
binders for many different targets. However, selections from naïve
libraries often result in binders with low or mediocre affinities,
especially if the diversity of the library is not sufficient.26 Randomness in the sequence can be introduced
at the nucleotide level varying all of the nucleotides of the codons
(NNN), resulting in highly biased diversity since some amino acids
are represented by several codons and furthermore three codons are
stop codons. Thus generally, degeneracy at the codon level is preferred
as it gives a less biased representation of the amino acids. In fact,
even less redundant diversity where only the third position of the
codon is allowed to vary either as G/C or G/T (NNK or NNS) is sufficient
to cover all of the 20 amino acids.6

In some cases, randomization is restricted to certain regions,
thus creating a constrained library opposed to an unconstrained one.
In general, constrained peptide libraries present less three-dimensional
shapes than an unconstrained library and, therefore, the probability
for target binding is reduced. However, those with appropriate conformations
may possess far higher affinities than any unconstrained peptide because
the loss in entropy on target binding is likely less than for unconstrained
peptide.2,26 Common constraint on displayed peptides
is a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues at fixed positions
in an otherwise random sequence, resulting in cyclic peptides. Similarly,
coordination bonds between histidine residues and metal ions can be
used as constraints.2,26 Alternative, constrained peptides
can be presented in the context of a protein scaffold, such as α-helices,
β-sheets, or other secondary structure elements. In a sense,
antibody libraries actually entail a protein scaffold where specific
regions responsible for the antigen binding have been randomized.

Antibody Libraries
Although the first use of phage
display focused on peptides, antibody libraries have been arguably
the most successful use of this technology and have led to the discovery
of antibodies with affinities comparable to those obtained by hybridoma
technology.9,27 In fact, alongside with the development
of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology28 and the isolation and cloning of antibody genes to enable
expression of antibody fragments in bacteria,29,30 the generation of antibody libraries by phage display can be considered
as one of the groundbreaking methods for the antibody discovery.

Antibody libraries can be constructed from natural sources by isolating
the B cells of a source animal that has been immunized with the target
antigen and using the isolated antibody genes to create the antibody
library.31 These kind of libraries have
a strong bias toward the antigen, and even a modest-sized library
can be sufficient to isolate specific binders. However, construction
of a separate immunized library is needed for each antigen, although
immunization with several antigens simultaneously is also possible.32 Most of these libraries are produced from mouse,33−37 but also other animals, such as chicken,38,39 rabbit,32,40 sheep,41 monkey,42 camel,43 and shark,44 have been used. Additionally, immunized human
libraries have been made using blood from patients naturally infected
with viruses or parasites.5,45

On the other
hand, naïve antibody libraries can be constructed
completely in vitro resulting in nonimmunized,46 synthetic,47 or semisynthetic
libraries.48 The use of synthetic repertoires
bypasses the need to isolate antibody genes and allows generating
sequences with predefined properties, or using optimal framework sequences.49 Nonimmunized libraries are a result of rearranged
antibody genes isolated from B cells of healthy individuals that have
not been intentionally immunized. Semisynthetic and combinatorial
libraries combine natural and synthetic sequences. Such libraries
are usually constructed by introducing synthetic diversity into a
naïve library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assembly of
germline genes, or by recombination of in vivo formed complementarity-determining
regions (CDRs).9 Synthetic libraries are
constructed entirely in vitro using oligonucleotides to introduce
diversity into the CDRs. While antibodies with mediocre affinities
are readily screened from relatively small naïve or synthetic
libraries, in general, for isolating high-affinity binders, the diversity
of the library becomes significant.9 In
fact, studies have shown a linear correlation between the library
size in terms of diversity and the highest affinity that has been
isolated, meaning that, in particular, in the case of naïve
or synthetic libraries, the size of the library must be large enough
to increase the probability of finding a given antibody and enhance
the quality of the antibody.50

Other Functional
Domains and Scaffolds
Phage display
technology also offers a means to explore other nonantibody protein
binders. Functional protein domains refer to short polypeptide chains
that are capable of creating a three-dimensional structure required
for a defined functional activity.5 For
example, affibodies are engineered single-domain proteins, in which
a functional scaffold has been derived from protein A.51 Affibody molecule libraries have been constructed
by combinatorial randomization of the amino acids in the scaffold
and used to select binders by phage display.52,53 Other binding scaffolds include, for example, anticalins,54,55 DARPins,56 knottins,57 atrimers, and fynomers,58 which
all can be selected using phage display, although these binders have
been less used in biosensing applications.

In Vitro Affinity Selections
Individual clones from phage-displayed libraries theoretically
can be directly screened for target binding, for example, by immunoassays,
in a manner resembling screening of synthetic or chemical libraries
that must be screened compound by compound. However, screening of
libraries consisting of millions to billions of different clones is
limited by the number of clones that can be examined.9 To efficiently isolate specific binders, the library needs
to be coupled to a technology that provides the means to carry out
selections from these repertoires. In vitro display technologies,
which basically mimic the natural in vivo process of antibody production,
have enabled such proficient enrichment and selection of binders in
a rapid and controllable manner. The essence of the display technologies
resides in the physical linkage between the phenotype of the phage
displaying the protein or peptide on the surface and the genotype
encoding for that entity packaged as the genetic information within
the same phage particle. This link enables selection of phage-displayed
libraries and powerful enrichment by selective propagation of the
individuals with the desired properties.9 Thus, a single displayed entity, be it a peptide, protein, or antibody
fragment, of the desired trait, can be captured from a pool of billions
of variants and its gene can be amplified and used for another selection
round or whatever downstream purpose might be desired.8

Although phage display is the most renowned technique
for screening
libraries,13,59 also other display methods, including
cell surface display using bacteria,60 yeast,61 or mammalian cells,62 as well as cell-free systems, such as ribosome display,63 have been successfully applied to screen antibody
libraries. Although less popular than phage display technology, these
methods present some advantages, such as the ability of yeast cells
to express complex proteins that require post-translational modifications
or the possibility to create larger libraries using cell-free methods
that are not restricted by the bacterial transformation efficiency.64

The process of in vitro affinity selection,
whether it is based
on phage or other display systems, commonly includes (I) the generation
of genotypic diversity by constructing protein or peptide libraries
that consist of millions or billions of different variants; (II) the
display method that creates a physical link between the expressed
protein variant and the gene coding for it; (III) the application
of selective pressure to screen for target-specific binders, and,
finally, (IV) the amplification of the selected variants.9 Remarkable features of in vitro selection technologies
include the possibility of defining the selection conditions carefully,
the potential for high-throughput applications, and further improvement
of selected binders by various protein engineering methods, for example,
to achieve better affinity or stability, to reduce unwanted cross-reactivities,
or to add tags for further purification or immobilization.65−67 These systems provide immediately the genes and corresponding DNA
sequences of the clones selected against the specific target. Simple
subcloning can allow presenting modifications or adding functionalities,
such as purification tags or fusions to enzymes or fluorescent proteins.65 Moreover, also conventionally challenging targets,
such as toxic or nonimmunogenic molecules, have been successfully
used.68,69

The screening process of phage-displayed
libraries, commonly known
as panning, includes introducing the phage-displayed library to the
target captured to a solid surface, washing to remove the unbound
and nonspecifically bound phages, elution of the bound phages, and
amplification of the eluted phages through bacterial infection (Figure 2A). Ideally, only
one round of selection is required, but as nonspecific binding limits
the enrichment in one selection round, in most cases, three to five
iterative rounds of selection and amplification are performed to select
individual binders.

Figure 2 Selection of affinity binders from a phage-displayed library.
(A)
Selection process consists of binding, washing, elution, and amplification
steps, which are usually repeated to three to five times to enrich
target-specific binders. (B) Target specificity of individual clones
can then be determined by screening the monoclonal clones from single
colonies in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the positive
clones can be identified by DNA sequencing.

A variety of modifications in the panning protocol and details
for improved selections have been described for the identification
of high-affinity binders from phage-displayed libraries. Generally,
the experiment can be designed to maximize either phage capture or
affinity discrimination. While effective capture is best used for
the first selection round, the conditions can be modified in the later
rounds to produce better affinity discrimination.5 The early rounds of selection can be considered as the
most important ones because any bias or loss of diversity during the
first round will be amplified in the subsequent rounds. Since the
number of potential binders is low among the highly diverse library,
a common practice is to maximize the capture of all interesting clones.
Later, when enrichment of selective clones is seen, and the diversity
is reduced in the subsequent rounds, stringency can be increased by
decreasing the target concentration or increasing the number or length
of the washes.6

The selections are
commonly carried out in solution or at a solid
phase. Most frequently, the target is directly immobilized on a solid
support, such as an immunotube, a bead, or a microtiter plate. This
enables the separation of bound and unbound phages simply by washing
the support.6 Small molecules, which cannot
be directly immobilized, are often conjugated to a carrier protein,
or chemically coupled to a linker like biotin. For binding in solution,
a biotinylated target is incubated with the phages in solution, after
which the target bound phages are captured by streptavidin, for example,
using magnetic beads.5

Because binding
is an equilibrium reaction where the amount of
the binder–target complex formed is determined by the affinity
and the concentrations of the binder and the target, the amount of
the target used for the selections is one of the critical factors
in the process. Theoretical models suggest that high-affinity binders
should be selected with a target concentration lower than the dissociation
constant (KD), but often target excess
is used, in particular, in the first rounds, to allow capture of a
higher fraction of the phage population and decrease the risk of losing
the rare high-affinity binders.70 However,
by using limited and decreasing amounts of the target in the later
rounds, the selection favors high-affinity binders.9 Additionally, if multivalent display is used, avidity will
play a significant role in the binding and seemingly good binders,
with actually low affinity, might be selected due to avidity effects.
When selection of high-affinity binders is desired, monovalent display
is thus preferred,6 although the use of
a controlled density of the target during the selections can reduce
avidity effects, favoring one-to-one binding interactions even with
multivalent displays.24

On the other
hand, also, the washing step is of great importance.
Typically, affinity, in terms of the KD that is the ratio of the association (kon) rate to the dissociation rate (koff), can be improved by removing phages with fast dissociation rates
in the washing step. The number and length of the washings can be
thus optimized to select high-affinity binders. Short incubation times,
short washes, low target concentration, and a decreased number of
input phage might favor the selection of clones with fast binding.9,71 Finally, in the elution step, bound phages are typically eluted
by addition of an acid or a base to break the binding interactions.
If such treatment is not efficient enough, it will result in the loss
of high-affinity binders. On the contrary, the application of too
harsh conditions might affect the infectivity of the phage and have
consequences in the amplification step. Alternatively, elution can
be done by competition, i.e., by adding an excess of the free target
to the selections or by cleavage of phages that include a specific
protease cleavage site between the phage and the displayed binder.5

One of the remarkable features of phage
display is the possibility
to carefully determine the selection conditions favoring the selection
of binders, for example, with fast kinetics or improved biophysical
properties. For instance, thermodynamically or otherwise stable variants
have been selected by subjecting the library to elevated temperature,72 low pH, or protease treatment.73 Heat denaturation can be also used to select aggregation-resistant
proteins or identify features that promote or prevent protein aggregation.74,75 Finally, it should be also noted that the amplification step is
susceptible to artifacts such as biased production of clones that
are capable of growing faster than an average clone.6 Thus, it is not only the affinity of the binder that determines
which clones enrich but also the toxicity of the specific clones to
the bacterial host, the solubility, folding efficiency, and stability
of the expressed variant may contribute to the outcome of phage display.

The outcome of any selection process is a mixture of clones with
different target-binding properties. Screening of individual clones,
typically by phage-based immunoassays (for example, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, ELISA), is needed to evaluate their target-binging
capabilities. Finally, DNA sequencing of selected clones can be used
as a guideline to define at what stage to screen the library and identify
the individual protein or peptide variants (Figure 2B).9 Recent developments
in the automation of the selection process have enabled rapid screening,
for example, for several targets simultaneously. Moreover, screening
robots allow testing of thousands of different binders9 and protein microarrays can prove useful for high-throughput
analysis of the specificity and affinity.76

In continuation of mimicking the natural selection process,
similarly
to affinity maturation in vivo, in which the immune response is capable
of producing antibodies with an increased affinity,77 a variety of in vitro techniques can be used to improve
the affinity and specificity of the binders. The process, known as
in vitro affinity maturation, comprises a variety of mutagenesis strategies
that have been used to construct second-generation libraries, based
on desired characteristics of the parental peptide or antibody, with
some fixed or biased sequences. Various techniques used include random
mutagenesis using DNA modifying enzymes or error-prone PCR, introducing
mutations to certain areas or residues of the antibody, usually in
the variable region and the hypervariable loops, for example, by oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis. Also, DNA recombination, including using natural evolution
or recombination of the target gene, can be used to recombine homologous
segments to emphasize the desired property or to shuffle heterologous
genes to create new diversity.6,78

Recognition Elements for
Biosensors
The importance of monitoring and regulating various
biologically
significant molecules in many different disciplines, such as clinical
chemistry, environmental protection, drug discovery, forensics, and
food industry, has incited the development of reliable sensing devices
capable of accurate analysis.79−84 Biosensors can provide rapid, sensitive, low-cost, real-time, and
on-site analysis with compact and low-power devices. Owing to their
appealing advantages, they have emerged as one of most interesting
approaches to overcome the limitations of currently applied conventional
methods, for example, for environmental monitoring, food analysis,
and point-of-care medical applications.85 The high specificity and sensitivity of biomolecular recognition,
which is typically driven by a concert of many weak interactions,
is the cornerstone of biosensor development, as the binding event
has a direct effect on the accuracy of the method.1,86 The
recognition element of choice must be able to detect the target analyte
even at low concentrations, and moreover, it ought to differentiate
it from other similar molecules that might be present in the sample
simultaneously.

Initially, biosensors were mainly based on enzymes
and polyclonal
or monoclonal antibodies as recognition elements, but in recent years,
phage display has become a useful tool to identify new biorecognition
elements for particular targets.1 For example,
the use of recombinant antibodies has several advantageous characteristics
in comparison with conventional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.
To begin with, the small size of antibody fragments is usually accompanied
by a decrease of nonspecific binding often caused by the Fc region
of the intact antibody and the possibility to immobilize the antibodies
at a higher density.87 Moreover, unlike
full-length antibodies, recombinant antibody fragments can be propagated
in bacteria, such as E. coli, which
significantly lower the cost of production as no specialized cell
culture facilities for hybridoma cell lines are needed.88,89 On the other hand, phage display also offers the possibility of
selecting various other bioinspired recognition elements,25 such as peptides or other binding proteins and
scaffolds, which might provide further advantages compared to antibodies.
In vitro selections by phage display facilitates the production of
novel receptors beyond known biomolecular interactions, or against
toxic or nonimmunogenic targets, or even using whole cells as the
target.1

Wild-type or genetically
modified phages, as well as individual
phages displaying a particular protein or peptide of interest, can
be directly used as biorecognition elements as has been reported in
a myriad of phage-based biosensors.90,91 Biosensors
for pathogen detection can be based on the inherent ability of the
phages to bind to their target pathogen,92 or phages can be utilized as a means to display the biorecognition
element, be it an antibody fragment, a peptide, or any other protein
binder. Antibody fragments, mostly single-chain variable fragments
(scFv), have been widely used for various targets in biosensing applications
where their small size in comparison with the intact IgG can be of
advantage.87 Other common recombinant antibody
fragments include the heavy-chain antibodies (VHH), also
known as nanobodies or single-domain antibodies, which have gained
significant attention due to their extraordinary structure that is
completely devoid of the light chains.66,93 Alternatively,
short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries have been
introduced as an interesting alternative for the development of new
biosensing platforms because of their small size and cost efficiency.
Peptides often suffer from a poor or mediocre affinity in comparison
with antibodies, which might limit their use in certain applications.
Nevertheless, although the interactions of an individual peptide with
its target might be weak, stronger binding has been achieved by multivalent
display on the phage particles, resulting in significant avidity effects.
Various recognition elements have been applied to biosensors in their
phage-displayed format, but, on the other hand, once an individual
target-specific phage has been identified, the phage itself becomes
expendable. After identification, the recognition element thus may
also be subcloned into an expression system for large-scale production
and different downstream applications. Alternatively, short peptides
can also be chemically synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthesis.

Recombinant antibodies and short peptides originating from phage-displayed
libraries have been reported in various biosensor applications, most
notably in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).1 Furthermore, numerous different phage-based sensing schemes
have been published recently using other transduction techniques,
for example, fluorescence, Raman, quartz crystal microbalance, magnetoelastic,
and electrochemical techniques. In this context, we will introduce
a few interesting and recent applications for different kinds of targets
(Table 1), but for
a comprehensive overview of phage-based biosensors, we refer the reader
to recent review articles.7,91,92,94

Label-free techniques,
such as SPR, are often able to provide simple
detection of the target binding to the recognition element immobilized
on the sensor surface. Such measurements enable real-time monitoring
of the binding reaction and can be used to evaluate also the kinetic
and thermodynamic parameters of the molecular recognition process.95,96 SPR biosensors for the detection of whole cells such as Listeria monocytogenes(97) and Salmonella(98) have
been reported using phage-displayed antibodies or peptides, enabling
detection of the cells in the range of 106–107 cfu mL–1. Another label-free biosensor
based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and specific peptides
selected from a landscape phage library-enabled99 detection of cancer cells down to 79 cells mL–1. Phages have also arisen as an interesting option for multifunctional
structures. For example, Staphylococcus aureus-specific pVIII fusion protein identified by phage display was used
in combination with bifunctional gold nanoprobes for label-free, rapid,
and sensitive colorimetric detection of pathogens.100 For optical detection of cancer cells, phage fusion proteins
were combined with Au@Ag heterogeneous nanorods in a self-assembled
biomimetic nanostructure.101 In a different
approach, phages displaying a target-specific peptide were assembled
with silver nanoparticles to identify U937 cells by surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS).102

Antibody
fragments originating from phage-displayed libraries have
been reported for various protein targets, such as scFv against dengue
virus nonstructural protein103 or single
variable domain antibodies (VHH) from camel against prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) that were applied to PSA detection by SPR.104,105 Also, various peptide binders against protein targets have been
selected by phage display, for example, for the development of biosensors
applied to the analysis of protein targets, such as cholera toxin,106 troponin I,107 prostate-specific
antigen,108 norovirus capsid proteins,109,110 alanine aminotransferase,111 and sepsis112 or dengue fever biomarkers.113 Recently, a SERS biosensor based on M13 phages that display
cysteine-rich peptides on the pVIII was developed for triplex assay
in sepsis diagnosis. The assays on magnetic templates with picomolar
detection limits was described as a promising alternative for early
clinical diagnosis of sepsis.114

Small-molecule targets, haptens, which might be challenging targets
for antibody development, have been also successfully used to develop
antibodies by phage display. The selection and application of scFvs
against various targets, such as morphines,115 mycotoxins,116−118 and environmental toxins including microcystins,119,120 have been reported. For such applications, soluble antibody fragments
are commonly expressed in E. coli after
identifying the target-binding clones by phage display. For example,
HT-2 mycotoxin was analyzed using antibody fragments selected from
an immunized library together with anti-immune complex antibodies
from a naïve phage-displayed library.121 The noncompetitive immunoassays for HT-2 analysis enabled detection
of the toxin with excellent sensitivity and specificity. In a different
approach, scFv for 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene was conjugated to luminescent
quantum dots to develop solution-phase nanoscale sensing assemblies
based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for the specific
detection of the explosive in aqueous environments.122 Also, some applications of nanobodies for small-molecule
detection have been reported recently, mainly for mycotoxins.123−126 Nanobodies have some advantageous characteristics beyond their small
size, most notably excellent shelf life and high stability even in
harsh conditions or at elevated temperatures.66,127

Short peptides originating from phage-displayed libraries
have
also been reported for small-molecule detection. For example, for
the detection of herbicide glyphosate, an oligopeptide was identified
from a phage display library and the synthetic was immobilized onto
the SPR gold sensor chip for the analysis.128 Alternatively, bisphenol A was detected by differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) and a cysteine-flanked heptapeptide as the recognition element.129 For the detection of a flame retardant polybrominated
diphenyl ether, a peptide receptor was integrated with a carbon nanotube
field-effect transistor for the selective detection of the target
in the femtomolar range.130 Interestingly,
phage display has also been employed to select binders against inorganic
materials, such as ZnS,131 CdS,132 ZnO,133 and TiO2,134 widening the range of biosensor
applications based on phage assemblies and phage–nanomaterial
complexes.135

Future Perspectives
Since the first description of phage display more than 30 years
ago, various applications have demonstrated the significance of the
technology and it has been established as a valuable and remarkably
versatile tool in many disciplines for selecting affinity binders
and exploring interactions between proteins, peptides, and small-molecule
ligands, making significant contributions to the study of molecular
recognition.5,6 Among the striking success stories
of phage display, peptide libraries have been used for instance to
develop low-nanomolar peptide agonists136,137 and antibody
libraries have opened the way for the generation of human antibodies
against various targets, including more than 60 antibodies obtained
from phage-displayed libraries that have been approved for human therapy.138,139

For biosensor development, phage display can offer a new means
to discover recognition elements, even beyond natural and known biomolecular
interactions. In vitro selection of novel affinity binders allows
tight control over the selection conditions as well as the use of
conventionally challenging targets, or even whole cells. Although
immunized libraries often result in excellent affinities, synthetic
and naïve phage libraries, in particular, represent an intriguing
alternative as they can be used to select antibodies against virtually
any target, at least theoretically, within couple of weeks without
the need of animal immunization. Moreover, since the library selections
are solely based on affinity, also toxins and biologically active
or threatening targets can be directly used unlike when animal immunization
is required.

One of the important factors when choosing a recognition
element
for biosensors is the shelf life and stability of the receptor. While
conventional antibodies might suffer from poor stability, phage display
can be used to select folded and thermodynamically stable proteins
from libraries. For example, camel or shark antibodies (and especially
VHH camel nanobodies) have gained great attention in the
last years for their reduced size, high stability, improved solubility,
and improved solvent compatibility, which make them of special interest
for the development of biosensors.

Often after identifying the
ideal recognition element, the biosensor
is constructed using the recombinant or synthetic affinity element.
However, also phage particles by themselves can be integrated into
the biosensing devices with emerging materials and nanostructures.
In this sense, phages can be magnetically or metallically combined
and then bioinspired analytical nanodevices or sensing materials can
be constructed with tunable sensor properties for the detection of
target molecules. On the other hand, application of phages for in
vivo biosensing systems (for example, for medical diagnosis, foodborne
control, etc.) should be preceded by toxicity tests to avoid any safety
or social concern because of their viral nature.

Although advances
in this field have been impressive in the last
few years, the future of phages as sensing elements will require a
multidisciplinary collaboration between experts from different scientific
fields to boost their applications at the level of other usual biorecognition
elements. Therefore, we can expect due to phage display overall trajectory
and versatility since its discovery a whole generation of phage-derived
biosensing devices in the near future.
