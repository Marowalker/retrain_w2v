Protein
detection and identification are important for the diagnosis
of diseases; however, the development of facile sensing probes still
remains challenging. Here, we present an array-based “turn
on” protein-sensing platform capable of detecting and identifying
proteins using aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens).
The water-soluble AIEgens in which fluorescence was initially turned
off showed strong fluorescence in the presence of nanomolar concentrations
of proteins via restriction of the intramolecular rotation of the
AIEgens. The binding affinities between the AIEgens and proteins were
associated with various chemical functional groups on AIEgens, resulting
in distinct fluorescent-signal outcomes for each protein. The combined
fluorescence outputs provided sufficient information to detect and
discriminate proteins of interest by linear discriminant analysis.
Furthermore, the array-based sensor enabled classification of different
concentrations of specific proteins. These results provide novel insight
into the use of the AIEgens as a new type of sensing probe in array-based
systems.

Introduction
Rapid, precise, and
sensitive detection of proteins is critical
in diagnostic fields because increasing/decreasing concentrations
of specific proteins are associated with the incidence of many diseases.1 However, the development of sensing tools for
the rapid identification of proteins still remains a challenging task
due to their complexity and structural diversity. Traditionally, the
“lock and key” theory is used, focusing on antigen–antibody
or aptamer–antibody interactions for detection of proteins
in single or multiplex diagnostic platforms.2−6 This strategy is practical but requires a full characterization
of proteins that are often mutated upon disease progression.7 Alternatively, array-based sensing systems utilizing
combined recognition of multiple specific proteins with a selectivity-based
modality have been developed and represent convenient and rapid methods
that do not require high degrees of specificity between the analyte
and recognition element.

To develop a successful array-based
sensing system, analytes and
recognition elements should possess distinct selectivities that result
in different responses. In this respect, a “chemical or artificial
nose” strategy was developed to detect and discriminate various
proteins through interactions between an individual analyte and cross-reactive
recognition elements harboring an array of response patterns.8,9 In recent years, various array-based protein-sensing systems have
been developed, including those utilizing substituted porphyrins,10 polymers,11 protein–nanoparticle
composites,12 and synthetic polymer–nanoparticle
composites with differential fluorescence response.13 Furthermore, array-based sensors have been investigated
to discriminate various important analytes, including flavonoids and
red wine varietals,14 sugars,15 metal ions,16 amino
acids,17 and cells.18 However, the array-based sensors were designed by utilizing
competitive binding interactions, so additional steps were required
to prepare the recognition elements incorporating transducers. Therefore,
if a single molecule can play both roles as recognition and transducer
elements and consequent signals (e.g., fluorescent emission) upon
protein (analyte) binding result in distinct patterns depending on
the protein, a technique capitalizing on the direct binding between
the recognition elements and proteins of interest would represent
a more convenient and precise array-based sensing system.

Herein,
we demonstrated a rapid, precise, and simple “turn
on” protein-sensor array based on affinity between proteins
and aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). Aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) has emerged as a new platform for biological imaging
and sensing involving turn on fluorescent sensors.19 AIEgens display nonfluorescence upon free intramolecular
rotation in solution but exhibit strong fluorescent signal when their
molecular conformations are restricted under aggregate states. In
this study, we developed various AIEgens having different functional
groups, with these molecules providing a monodispersive and reproducible
chemical-nose system capable of discriminating proteins. Upon randomly
binding to proteins, the AIEgens displayed distinct fluorescence responses
dependent upon the affinities associated with the electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions between AIEgens and proteins. Based on the
distinct fluorescent responses, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
was performed to discriminate and identify the protein patterns (Scheme 1). These results
suggested that these water-soluble AIEgens represent a new protein-sensing
probe for use in the development of an array-based system.

protein.

Results and Discussion
The water-soluble
AIEgens were synthesized by a hydrazone-formation
reaction between benzaldehyde and hydrazine under mild conditions
(Figure 1). Reaction
between 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (compound 1) and hydrazine
yielded the intermediate compound 2, which was further
reacted with t-butyl bromoacetate to produce the
negatively charged carboxylate AIE-1 by deprotection
of the t-butyl group with trifluoroacetic acid. Intermediate 3, 5-bromopropyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, was prepared by the
reaction with compound 1 and 1,3-dibromopropane, and
subsequent reaction with hydrazine was performed to produce compound 4. AIE-2, AIE-3, and AIE-4 were synthesized from compound 4 by functionalization
with trimethylamine, dimethylamine, and sodium sulfite to create positively
charged, neutral, and negatively charged molecules, respectively.
All intermediates and AIEgens were confirmed and characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR (Supporting Information).

AIEgens

properties (AIE-1–4). N2H4·H2O, hydrazine monohydrate; TFA, trifluoroacetic
acid.

To investigate AIE phenomena in
water/tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixtures,
the optical properties of each compound were studied in aqueous solution
by varying the amount of THF. We induced aggregation by adding THF
to the water solution of AIEgens because the molecules completely
dissolve in water but are insoluble in THF. As shown in Figure 2a, AIE-1 in water
showed strong absorbance at 365 nm; however, absorption in 95% THF
aqueous solution decreased and blue-shifted from 365 to 355 nm, indicating
the presence of H-aggregation.20AIE-2, -3, and -4 showed similar
tendencies in aqueous solution and a mixture of H2O/THF
(v/v, 5:95), eliciting strong absorption at 365 nm in aqueous solution,
but broad and decreased absorption in 95% THF aqueous solution (Figure S1). With the gradual addition of THF
from the volumetric fraction of THF (fTHF = 0–95%), the AIE phenomenon of the AIEgens was observed.
In water (fTHF = 0%), all of the AIEgens
(AIE-1–4) were nearly nonfluorescent
due to the lack of restriction of N–N-bond rotation in their
unaggregated states (Figures 2b and S2). At levels up to fTHF = 60%, the emission intensities at 520 nm
did not change significantly; however, from fTHF = 60–95%, a strong emission was observed, indicating
the formation of aggregates due to poor solubility in a high amount
of THF. As shown in Figure 2b, the clear aqueous solution becomes greenish yellow at 95%
THF under 365 nm UV illumination. The emission intensities of the
four AIEgens at fTHF = 95% were from 12-
to 100-fold stronger than those in water and exhibited both AIE characteristics
and excited state of intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) properties,
allowing a large Stokes shift that resulted in green emission. These
results indicated that the synthesized four AIEgens showed high emission
intensity in the aggregated state but no fluorescence in water due
to their solubility.

alone. (a) UV–vis absorption spectra and (b) fluorescence spectra
of AIE-1 in water (black line) and in a mixture of water/THF
(v/v, 5:95) (red line). λex = 365 nm; [AIE-1] = 40 μM.

The AIEgens are not fluorescent
in pure water but can be strongly
fluorescent in the presence of the proteins because electrostatic
and hydrophobic interactions between AIEgens and proteins can prevent
the free intramolecular rotation of the AIEgens. Based on this assumption,
we hypothesized that AIEgens could be used as turn on protein sensors.
To test this hypothesis, we evaluated interactions between AIE-2 and esterase. AIE-2 showed almost no fluorescence in
40 μM aqueous solution; however, AIE-2 emission
intensity increased 5-fold following the addition of esterase in pH
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (Figure 3), allowing observation of a distinct variation
in fluorescence under 365 nm UV illumination.

of AIE-2 in the absence and
presence of esterase. The inset shows images of AIE-2 solution before and after the addition of 500 nM esterase. λex = 365 nm; [AIE-2] = 40 μM.

Various functional groups on the four AIEgens can
affect their
interaction with proteins based on their binding affinities. Therefore,
we expected that the strong interaction between two composites would
result in high levels of fluorescence emission because of the restriction
of intramolecular rotation, whereas weak interactions would result
in low emission intensity. We chose five proteins [bovine serum albumin
(BSA), esterase, transferrin, fibrinogen, and β-galactosidase]
that exhibit a wide range of molecular weights (∼66–540
kDa) and isoelectric points (pI: 4.6–6.3). To determine the
stoichiometry of the AIEgen randomly binding to a protein, saturation
point of emission intensity (at 520 nm) between AIEgens and proteins
was measured when the protein concentration was fixed at 5 μM
by increasing concentrations of AIE-1 and AIE-2 from 0 to 64 μM. As illustrated in Figure S4, the normalized fluorescent intensity was saturated around
30 μM, suggesting that six AIEgens were bound to one protein.
Next, to determine the binding constant, the measured fluorescence
intensity [1/(F – F0)] at 520 nm was plotted and showed a linear relationship with 1/[protein]
by using the Benesi–Hildebrand plot. At fixed concentration
(5 μM) of AIEgen, five proteins whose concentration was increased
by 0–20 μM were treated to a solution of AIEgens. The
emission intensity was measured to make the Benesi–Hildebrand
plot to estimate the binding constant of AIEgen for each protein (Figures S5–S9 and Table S2).

Then,
to investigate the classifying capacity of the AIEgen, we
loaded 40 μM of each AIEgen and 500 nM of each protein, separately,
into 96-well plates and recorded changes in the intensities at 520
nm, with six replicates. As shown in Figure 4a, unique fluorescence-response patterns
were generated following normalization of the fluorescence intensities
(F/F0) against each AIEgen
in the presence and absence of protein. Based on the different interaction
between AIEgen and protein, unique fluorescence patterns were generated
to distinguish each protein (Table S1).
In specific, the AIE-2 and AIE-3 exhibited
stronger selectivity to esterase, which is presumably due to the electrostatic
interaction between the amine functions of the AIE-2 and AIE-3 and the esterase (isoelectric point: ∼5.5).

experiments. Each value is an average of six parallel measurements.
(b) LDA analysis using two-dimensional (2D) plots with 95% ellipse
confidence.

LDA can be employed to
differentiate each fluorescence pattern
and to classify the proteins qualitatively and quantitatively.21 LDA is an advanced statistical tool used for
data reduction to maximize the separation between classes and minimize
the variance within classes that need to be differentiated.22 The fluorescence patterns obtained from the
4 AIEgens × 5 proteins × 6 replicates resulted in a total
of 120 data points, which we translated into two-dimensional (2D)
plots by performing LDA. The result distinguished the five proteins
by canonical factors, which were 82.15, 16.39, 0.85, and 0.61%. As
shown in Figure 4b,
the 2D LDA score plots of the first two factors with 95% ellipse confidence
showed a clear classification of the five proteins without overlapping
each other. The measured data in the LDA plots indicated reproducibility
and distance between closely neighboring proteins. Additionally, the
first two canonical factors allowed generation of a 2D plot and good
clustering of the 98.5% of five proteins, demonstrating that the protein-sensing
system using AIEgens was adequate to classify the five proteins.

With the successful detection of several proteins at one fixed
concentration, we further investigated the identification of proteins
at different concentrations, which potentially enables clinical application
of this method. Here, we performed additional experiments using BSA
and esterase at four different conditions (200, 500 nM, 1, and 2 μM).
As shown in Figure 5a, the fluorescence intensities of AIE-1 and AIE-4 in the presence of 2 μM BSA were 3-fold higher than that in
the presence of 200 nM BSA. Additionally, the fluorescence intensities
of AIE-2 and AIE-3 in the presence of 2
μM esterase were 5-fold higher than that in the presence of
200 μM esterase. These results indicated that noncovalent interactions
between the proteins and the AIE functional groups allowed distinct
fluorescence patterns to enable recognition of each analyte. Furthermore,
this sensor array successfully distinguished eight samples of the
two analytes (BSA, esterase) at four different concentrations (200,
500 nM, 1, and 2 μM) without overlapping. Subsequent LDA analysis
revealed four canonical factors of 71.17, 26.58, 2.23, and 0.02%,
respectively. As shown in Figure 5b, the 2D plot of the first two factors with 95% ellipse
confidence is distinct.

and esterase at different
concentrations. (a) Fluorescence patterns of AIE-1 to AIE-4 (40 μM) in the presence of BSA and esterase at
200, 500 nM, 1, and 2 μM. Each value represents an average of
six parallel measurements. (b) LDA analysis of the results using 2D
with 95% ellipse confidence.

After confirming the classification of two proteins, we further
performed experiments to classify the target proteins in the mixture
of proteins. The target proteins (BSA, esterase, and β-galactosidase)
were mixed with 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the AIE fluorescence
of the proteins was measured. By deducting basis of AIE fluorescence
(from 4% FBS), distinct fluorescence responses were obtained and subjected
to LDA analysis, which showed the identification of the target proteins
from the protein mixture. Two canonical factors were 96.45 and 3.55%,
and one-dimensional data can discriminate 94.65% for the three proteins
in the FBS. These findings indicate that this method will allow the
classification of proteins at different concentrations and among mixtures
for the diagnosis of specific diseases.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we developed a sensitive and rapid turn on sensor
capable of distinguishing proteins based on AIE characteristics. The
fluorescence patterns associated with AIEgen-protein affinity allowed
differentiation depending on nonspecific electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions between AIE functional groups and proteins. Proteins
with stronger affinity to specific AIEgens resulted in higher fluorescence
intensities, enabling acquisition of unique florescence patterns for
each protein. LDA analysis was performed to verify pattern recognition
and accurate classification. Our results indicated that the sensor
array accurately detected and distinguished specific proteins at 500
nM. With unique responses, the different concentrations such as nanomolar
and micromolar scales of proteins analytes were discriminated with
the help of LDA analysis. Given that AIEgens represent an inexpensive
sensing strategy, this method is potentially suitable for biomedical
applications involving the detection of various analytes.
