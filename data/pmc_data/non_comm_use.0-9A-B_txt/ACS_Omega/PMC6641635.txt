Motivated by recent experiments,
we performed a theoretical study
of electron transport through single-molecule junctions incorporating
four kinds of homopeptides (based on alanine, glutamic acid, lysine,
and tryptophan). Our results suggest that these molecules are rather
insulating and operate in off-resonance tunneling as their main transport
mechanism. We ascribe their poor performance as conductors to the
high localization of their frontier orbitals. We found that binding
scenarios in which side chains lie on the side of gold protuberances
could give rise to an increase in conductance with respect to end-to-end
binding configurations. These findings provide an insight into the
conductance mechanism of the building blocks of proteins and identify
key issues that need to be further investigated.

Introduction
Over the last decade,
increasing interest has been growing on electron
transport through biosystems.1−12 Until recently, most of the experimental and theoretical studies
of the electron flow in biosystems had aimed at understanding the
electron transfer taking place in several important biological processes,
such as photosynthesis and aerobic respiration.13 However, the hope of building novel bio-nanoelectronic
devices based on biosystems has prompted the study of these systems
as incorporated in solid-state junctions.14 The design of such devices would take advantage of the redox and
optical functionalities of these systems as well as their chemical
recognition and self-assembly properties. In particular, proteins
have attracted remarkable attention because of their rich physical
(electrical and optical) properties. Their chemistry offers, for instance,
endless possibilities in terms of selective binding and self-assembly.
Moreover, it makes it possible to tune their properties by means of
biochemical modifications.15 Electron transport
through protein-based junctions was found to be surprisingly efficient,16 showing a conductance comparable to that of
much shorter alkanedithiol chains (for a detailed review, see ref (1)). In addition, the study
of proteins in solid-state devices could shed new light on the charge-transfer
mechanisms of proteins in biological settings despite differences
in the environments. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of transport
through proteins remains by and large unknown and is still under debate.1,17 To this aim, the study of electron transport through the building
blocks of proteins, namely, amino acids, peptides (short chains of
amino acids), and polypeptides, is crucial. Furthermore, over the
years, these systems have revealed interesting properties.13,18−26 Theoretical studies on transport through oligopeptides19,27 suggested that orbitals associated with peptide bonds can give rise
to states that extend across the entire molecular nanowire and that
can be brought into resonance with the Fermi level; moreover, current
rectification can be achieved due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the
peptide chains. In ref (22), it was shown that rates of charge tunneling along self-assembled
monolayers of oligoglycine are comparable to those along SAMs of oligophenyl
groups of comparable length. Doping a 7-alanine by one tryptophane28 was found to enhance transport by an order of
magnitude. Individual amino acids were compared,29 reporting similar conductances for glycine, alanine, and
proline. Numerous other experimental studies focused on identifying
the transport mechanism of peptides (tunneling vs hopping) and the
role of linkers as well as chemical and structural modification (see
ref (13) and the references
therein). In particular, in ref (18), the current through four families of heptapeptides
was studied thoroughly by combining theory and experiments. The current
measurements were performed on oligo-homopeptide monolayers held between
gold electrodes. In particular, heptatryptophan (7Trp) was found to
be the best conductor compared to heptaalanine (7Ala), heptaglutamic
acid (7Glu), and heptalysine (7Lys), its current being larger than
for the others by up to 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Upon analysis
of the gas-phase orbitals of these compounds, such a relationship
was ascribed to their different energetic distribution and spatial
localization. The current values reported correspond to conductance
values that are, for some of the molecules, higher than those
of alkanes of similar length. Moreover, for instance, the length-dependent
conductance decay for 7Trp was found to be slightly smaller than those
in fully saturated molecules. Such results are quite intriguing and
indicate that these systems are valid candidates to be employed in
the field of molecular electronics. However, analyses at the level
of single molecule and complete transport calculations, which would
better elucidate the conductance properties of these molecules, are
still missing to date. This prompted us to try shedding further light
on these molecules to contribute to the currently ongoing debate on
whether peptides can really play an active role in electron transport.
For this reason, we performed a theoretical study on the same peptide-based
compounds as those studied in ref (18). In our work, we take, however, full account
of the coupling to the metal electrodes by combining density functional
theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green’s function technique.
It is worth stressing that this study does not aim at reproducing
the exact conditions present in the experiments18 and the corresponding results: this is certainly not possible
because of the experimental uncertainties related to, for instance,
the number of contacted molecules, the uniformity of the self-assembled
monolayers, or the interaction between molecules. For these reasons,
and to establish a fair comparison across molecules, we shall rather
focus on the analysis of single-molecule junctions based on these
homopeptides. The central conclusion of our work is that, in the context
of single-molecule junctions, these peptides exhibit rather low conductance
compared to other organic molecules of similar length, and this behavior
in turn originates from the high localization of their frontier orbitals.

Results
and Discussion
Peptides (except for cyclic peptides) have
an “N-terminal”
and a “C-terminal” residue at their end, corresponding
to the presence of an amine (NH2) and a carboxyl (COOH)
group. Each of the four homopeptides studied in this work is composed
of seven identical amino acids (Ala, Trp, Glu, and Lys) and carries,
at the N-terminus, a sulfur atom through which it binds to gold (such
a bond was proven, in the experiments,18 by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy measurements performed
on the monolayer; however, no clear information was obtained about
the type of binding established at the C-terminus side after the formation
of the junction). To enable comparison of the theoretical conductance
values, we first built Au–homopeptide–Au junctions with
identical binding geometry for all four heptapeptides, namely, through
the S atom at the N-terminus side and through the O atom at the C-terminus
side, both atoms being connected to an undercoordinated gold atom
of pyramidal electrodes. Following previous literature, the H atom
of the COOH group was removed.30−35 The so-built geometries for the four junctions are shown in Figure 1, and the corresponding
gap-corrected zero-bias transmission as a function of energy is displayed
in Figure 2. In the
following, we will focus on coherent transport to study the relationship
between charge transfer and the ground-state electronic structure
of the molecules.

to gold
electrodes in a top position through an S atom at one end and an O
atom at the other end.

Figure 2 Zero-bias transmission as a function of energy for 7Ala, 7Glu,
7Lys, and 7Trp in the geometries shown in Figure 1 (the corresponding conductance values are,
in units of G0, 4.2 × 10–15, 1.4 × 10–16, 1.3 × 10–16, and 5.4 × 10–15; the vertical dashed line
indicates the Fermi energy).

This means that our calculations particularly apply to low-temperature
experiments, in which thermal fluctuations are very unlikely to play
a role. As an aside, we also note that an exponential length dependence
observed for the current indicated off-resonance tunneling as
the dominant conductance mechanism in the experiments.18 In the coherent regime, following the Landauer
approach, the conductance is given by G = G0T(EF), where G0 = 2e2/h is the quantum of conductance and T(EF) is the transmission at
the Fermi energy (given in turn by the sum over the energy-dependent
eigenvalues of the transmission matrix). For all curves in Figure 2, it is possible
to observe that the current flows through the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO). For 7Trp, 7Lys, and 7Glu, the conductance values (given
by the transmission at the Fermi level) follow the trend observed
in the experiments (GTrp > GLys ∼GGlu, see Table 1). Nevertheless,
7Ala,
which the experiments indicate to give the lowest conductance among
all, shows, in our simulations, a conductance comparable to that of
7Trp. Moreover, the theoretical conductance values (in units of G0, 4.2 × 10–15, 1.4 ×
10–16, 1.3 × 10–16, and 5.4
× 10–15 for 7Ala, 7Glu, 7Lys, and 7Trp, respectively)
appear to be much lower than those observed experimentally by more
than 5 orders of magnitude; the experimental values are summarized
in Table 1. The computed
values are clearly much lower than those measured for conjugated molecules
of similar length (∼10–7G0)36 and also even lower than
the conductance values obtained (by extrapolation) for alkanes of
comparable length (∼10–10G0).37

Our calculations
are based on single-molecule junctions and thus
do not take into account dipole–dipole interactions that could
be present between peptides inside a monolayer and that might lower
the HOMO–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap by
shifting the occupied (unoccupied) levels to higher (lower) energies.38 This would yield an increase in conductance,
which cannot be evaluated in our model and neither can we estimate
whether such effect would compensate the quantitative disagreement
that we observe between our results and the experiments. Nevertheless,
this goes beyond the scope of the present work, which aims at identifying
the conductance properties of these molecules as isolated. More precisely,
our simulations aim at predicting the results in single-molecule experiments,
where establishing a fairer comparison across peptides would be possible.
They thus do not address issues that might be important in SAM-based
junctions, such as the interaction between molecules, the inhomogeneities
in the junctions, or the potential modification of the metal work
function due to the interaction with the molecular monolayer.39 We note also that the structure of these heptapeptides
is very flexible; thus, a complete analysis should take into account
a broader range of structures (possibly extracted by molecular dynamics
calculations). In fact, although our simulations are meant to reproduce
experiments at low temperature, quenching of the molecular ensemble
at low temperature might induce the different molecules to freeze
in different conformations; this, together with the frequency of their
occurrence, could be sampled by molecular dynamics simulations and
give rise to a broader conductance range than that shown by our simulations.
For further insight, we now turn to analyze the orbitals of the four
heptapeptides in the gas phase (Figure 3). It can be observed that the orbitals corresponding
to the highest occupied levels, through which the current flows, are
all localized on regions that have a much smaller spatial extension
than the overall length (of around 25 ± 2 Å). This is obviously
reflected in the low conductance values obtained by our transport
calculations. Figure 3 also shows the Kohn–Sham energy values of the seven highest
occupied gas-phase orbitals (from HOMO to HOMO-7). In the case of
7Trp, it can be observed that they line up at very similar energies,
each orbital being localized on a different tryptophan unit. The same
does not apply to the other three molecules, for which the energy
is seen to decrease at a higher rate across the orbitals. For 7Trp,
the similar energy alignment of these orbitals gives rise to many
sharp transmission resonances that are very close to each other (Figure 2). Indeed, it was
suggested18 that these orbitals would form
a single HOMO band, with an overall charge density delocalized over
the entire molecule, which could explain the efficient tunneling process
observed experimentally for 7Trp. However, our results suggest that,
although the corresponding transmission resonances are indeed energetically
very close to each other, the overall conductance remains low. It
remains to be seen if different combinations of exchange–correlation
functionals and basis sets would change these conclusions by increasing
the level of delocalization of each individual orbital, thus giving
rise to the formation of a band and therefore increasing the overall
conductance of 7Trp. We also note that the asymmetry at the two ends
for 7Lys, 7Glu, and 7Ala seems to induce the charge to be localized
on one side of the molecule, as we can observe in Figure 3 for these three molecules.
Such an effect is clearly modified in the case of 7Trp, where the
side chains enable different charge localizations. This increases
the overall delocalization of the band, which would result by a combination
of the seven highest molecular orbitals. Thermal fluctuations have
not been considered in our simulations. However, measurements performed
at 7 and 300 K did not reveal any particular dependence on temperature
(Figure 3c in ref (18)). Our zero-bias calculations
do not take into account the effect of applying a voltage. Nevertheless,
this is not expected to change our main conclusions since the voltage
corresponding to the experimental values reported in Table 1 (0.1 V) corresponds to the
linear regime; indeed, the transmission resonances of the curves shown
in Figure 2 are well
beyond the energy window that would correspond to such a bias. In
particular, the transmission curves are relatively constant around
the Fermi energy in an energy range larger than 0.1 eV, which clearly
justifies our approximation.

Figure 3 Gas-phase occupied orbitals for 7Ala, 7Glu,
7Lys, and 7Trp and
the corresponding energetic positions. For 7Trp, all orbitals down
to HOMO-7 are shown since they are energetically competing. All values
have been shifted so as to set HOMO to zero for all molecules for
a better comparison.

It is also worth stressing that the S atom used to bind these
heptapeptides
to gold is not originally present in natural peptides, and recent
studies have been devoted to understanding the conductive properties
of peptides in the absence of additional anchoring groups and in their
native solvent (water).40 Thiol is one
of the most widely used end groups in molecular electronics (see ref (41) and references therein)
as it ensures robust binding to the electrodes. However, it is known
that anchoring groups can affect the conductance by shifting the frontier
molecular orbitals and by modifying the coupling to the leads.42 For instance, use of S atoms has been shown
to lead to different conductances depending on whether binding through
S or SH is established.43 However, it is
very unlikely that a different binding group would turn these molecules
into much better conductors, as low conductance has also been detected
in unmodified peptides.40

For the
tryptophan-based structure, we also studied the length
dependence of the conductance by changing the number of tryptophan
units (from 1 to 7). In ref (18), an exponential dependence was observed, with a β
decay constant of 0.58 Å–1, which was found
to be independent of temperature, suggesting tunneling as the dominant
transport mechanism. The theoretical transmission curves are shown
in Figure 4. The corresponding
β value (1.1 Å–1) is higher than the
experimentally obtained value and the values reported in the literature
for fully saturated molecules (0.8–1 Å–1)44 and conjugated ones (0.2–0.6
Å–1).45,46 We will return to the
issue of these discrepancies further ahead in the manuscript.

Figure 4 Transmission
as a function of energy for homopeptide consisting
of 1–7 Trp units. In the inset, conductance as a function of
the distance between the terminal S and the O atom connected to the
gold is reported, together with the corresponding linear fit (red
solid line).

Finally, we want to investigate
the conductance behavior of the
helical structure of 20Ala, which was also analyzed in ref (18), with the aim of studying
the role of the secondary structure. Due to the importance of helical
structures in electron-transfer processes, this topic has been the
object of several studies.21,47,48 In Figure 5b, we
show the structure of helical 20Ala embedded in the junction, whereas,
in Figure 5a, its transmission
curve is compared to that of the extended structure of 7Ala, which
has similar length. In ref (18), an increase in conductance of helical 20Ala compared to
extended 7Ala was reported. We observed a huge increase (by 10 orders
of magnitude, see Supporting Information) in the conductance of helical 20Ala with respect to its extended
structure; this is not surprising because the helical shape favors
electron transport by increasing the overlap between orbitals. However,
we did not observe any increase with respect to 7Ala. The reason for
the low conductance can probably be traced back, once again, to the
high localization of the relevant orbitals: Figure 5c shows that the six highest occupied molecular
orbitals of the gas-phase helical 20Ala are all localized on the side
of the C-terminus. This yields a strong asymmetry of the junction,
resulting in the corresponding transmission resonances being low.
Our model does not take into account the possibility of lifting the
spin degeneracy due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect,
which has previously been observed in helical peptides.48 Nevertheless, such an effect would reduce the
total conductance of 20Ala even further, contrary to what was found
in the experiments.

7Ala and
helical 20Ala; (b) geometrical structure for helical 20Ala in the
junction; and (c) six highest occupied gas-phase molecular orbitals

To find alternative explanations
for the quantitative disagreement
observed between theory and experiments (besides the absence of intermolecular
interaction effects that are not described here), we investigated
the possibility of occurrence of geometries different from those shown
in Figure 1, which
could lead to higher conductance. In Figure 6, we show other possible binding structures
that could be formed. Figure 6a,b show geometries in which the gold apex on the C-terminus
is close to not only the S atom but also one of the terminal oxygen
atoms; Figure 6c–f,
instead, show geometries in which the molecular end part on the side
of the C-terminus lies parallel to one face of the gold pyramid. Similar
structures have been suggested in the past.49,50 In the case of 7Lys (Figure 6e), we noted the formation of additional bonds between the
nitrogen atoms of the side chains and the gold atoms of the gold pyramid.
The corresponding transmission curves are shown in Figure 7 and compared to those obtained
for the geometries of Figure 1. We note that, for the transmission curves displayed in Figure 7, no gap correction
was applied.

7Ala (a,
c), 7Trp (b, f), 7Glu (d), and 7Lys (e), in addition to those shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 7 Transmission as a function of energy for the
geometries shown in Figure 6a–f. Those
labeled as “top–top” correspond to the geometries
shown in Figure 1.
No HOMO–LUMO gap correction was applied to the transmission
curves shown in this figure.

We can observe that geometries where the heptapeptides lie
parallel
to the face of the gold pyramid generally correspond to an increase
in conductance. This is mainly due to a shorter distance between the
two gold electrodes (see the Supporting Information for further details). Therefore, we suggest that part of the quantitative
disagreement we observed with the experiments for the results reported
above could be due to the fact that, when the whole monolayer junction
is formed, not all individual single-molecule junctions are formed
in such a way that only the extreme parts are bound to gold; instead,
some probably end up in configurations similar to those shown in Figure 6, which present higher
binding energies than in the end-to-end configurations (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). This
is plausible because once the top contact is formed upon landing of
the gold nanorod on the monolayer, some gold can penetrate between
one heptapeptide and the other. The geometries shown in Figure 6 are only an example of the
many configurations that could occur and other possible binding scenarios
that have here not been considered are possible.51 Moreover, the structures of these molecules are extremely
flexible, especially concerning the orientation of the side chains,
and can easily experience deformations that can lead them to several
kinds of structures. Moreover, for each geometry shown in Figure 6c–e, changing
the distance between the gold electrodes would yield a broad range
of conductance values. Overall, the complexity of this scenario leads
to highlighting the fact that performing single-molecule measurements
is highly needed in this case, to single out the contribution from
the individual homopeptides and rule out any additional effect due
to the interaction with the surrounding molecules.

Conclusions
The electron transport through four types of heptapeptides (Ala,
Trp, Glu, and Lys) and through shorter analogues of the Trp-based
molecule was studied theoretically. We found that these molecules
present rather low conductance and we ascribed this to the high localization
of their frontier orbitals. Furthermore, we compared our results to
those obtained experimentally and reported in previous literature.
On the basis of such a comparison, we suggest that a broad range of
binding geometries could be established in the junction, thanks to
the extreme structural flexibility of these molecules. More importantly,
we point out the need for single-molecule measurements on these systems
to clarify their transport properties.

Theoretical Methods
We built molecular junctions consisting of single homopeptides
held between gold electrodes. Ab initio calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) were then performed to determine the geometry
and the electronic structure of these systems as well as their transport
properties. The DFT calculations were carried out using the quantum
chemistry code TURBOMOLE,52 employing a
split-valence basis set with polarization functions for all nonhydrogen
atoms53 and the BP86 exchange–correlation
functional.54 We first carried out geometry
optimizations of all molecules in the gas phase and subsequently built
the gold–molecule–gold junctions by placing the relaxed
structures between two Au20 clusters; these junction geometries
were then optimized by allowing geometrical relaxation of the molecule
and of the four Au atoms closer to it on each side of the junction.
Afterward, further gold layers were added to the optimized structures
to extend the size of both clusters to around 60 atoms and to describe
correctly the metal–molecule charge transfer as well as the
corresponding level alignment. After running single-point calculations
on these junctions, we computed the zero-bias conductance of the junctions
with the Landauer formalism using Green’s function techniques.
Within our model, the electrodes are described as semi-infinite surfaces
and the Fermi level is obtained by a separate calculation of the electronic
structure of the infinite metallic leads.55 The HOMO–LUMO gap was corrected by the DFT + ∑ method.56,57 The DFT-D2 correction for the dispersive forces58 was included in the optimization of the geometries shown
in Figure 6.
