The title reaction is theoretically
investigated in detail using
density functional theory. Three possible routes starting from keto-
or enol-type vinylcyclopropylketone are considered in this work. Results
indicate that phosphine catalyst would first attack at the three-membered
ring (C3 position) rather than the terminal of alkene (C1 position)
in vinylcyclopropylketone. It is found that the two-stage mechanism
would be responsible for the title reaction. The first stage is the
SN2-type ring-opening of the keto-type vinylcyclopropylketone
with phosphine catalyst. After the proton-transfer tautomerisms in
the zwitterionic intermediates, the second stage is associated with
the 7-endo-trig SN2′-type ring
closure of keto- or enol-type zwitterions to furnish seven-membered
cyclic products and recover the catalyst. Moreover, it turns out that
7-endo-trig SN2′-type ring closure
would be highly asynchronous and could be well described as an addition/elimination
process where the ring closure already finishes before the cleavage
of the C–P bond. Computational results provide a deep insight
into experimental observations.

1 Introduction
Cycloalkanes
bearing a small ring are ideal candidates for the
organic synthesis, which benefits from the high strain-release energy
associated with the cleavage of the covalent bond.1 As for these strained cyclic compounds, the cleavage of
a three-membered ring would provide a significant driving force and
has attracted more attention in the synthesis. Donor–acceptor
cyclopropanes (DACs), one class of special three-membered cyclic compounds,
have high reactivity due to the electronic effect.2 In the past decades, many elegant methodologies have been
developed for the ring-opening of cyclopropanes,3 such as metal-catalyzed, Lewis acid-catalyzed, and radical-induced
ring-opening strategies.

On the other hand, several advances
have been made in phosphine-mediated
reactions,4 such as Wittig, Mitsunobu,
Staudinger, Appel, and so on. Phosphines could easily undergo a nucleophilic
addition on the electron-deficient unsaturated compounds, leading
to zwitterionic intermediates. Generally, phosphines participate in
reactions through the formation of phosphonium salts from alkyl halides,
phosphine dienolates from allenes, Kukhtin–Ramirez type adducts
from 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds, Huisgen zwitterions from diazene derivatives,
etc. Among these, the zwitterions generated from the nucleophilic
addition of trivalent phosphines to allenes have been extensively
investigated in synthetic applications for the formation of C–C
and C–heteroatom bonds.

Combined with the merits of cyclopropane
substrates and phosphine
catalysts, Xu et al. hypothesized that it was possible to form a ring-opening
zwitterionic intermediate by the addition of phosphines on to the
electron-deficient vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs).5 The VCPs might have to be treated as synthetic equivalents of C5
units to generate medium-sized cyclic backbones. Due to the unique
and varied reactivity, the VCPs have been extensively investigated
in modern organic synthesis.6

As
shown in Scheme 1,
Xu and co-workers examined the reactivity of 1,1-diacetyl-2-vinylcyclopropane.5 Different from the formation of dihydrofuran
via the Cloke–Wilson rearrangement by 1,4-diazabicyclooctane
(DABCO) catalyst,7 an unexpected phosphine-catalyzed
rearrangement of vinylcyclopropylketones to cycloheptenones was observed
in the experiment. This novel phosphine-catalyzed ring expansion of
vinylcyclopropylketones would be an alternative strategy for the construction
of seven-membered ring backbones. Under the optimal condition of 20
mol % PBu3 catalyst at 110 °C in toluene, the yield
of the product reaches 85%. With the aid of deuterated isotropic labeling,
reactive intermediate trapping, and 31P NMR tracking, a
catalytic cycle was proposed for the reaction mechanism. It mainly
includes two processes. Process 1 is the homoconjugate addition of
PBu3 on vinylcyclopropylketone to generate a zwitterion
via the ring-opening; Process 2 is associated with 7-endo-trig SN2′ ring closure for the seven-membered
cyclic product after the tautomerism of the zwitterionic intermediate
by the proton shift.

Scheme 1 Reported Phosphine-Catalyzed Rearrangement
of Vinylcyclopropylketone
in the Experiment5
Even so, some critical questions are hidden and need to be resolved.
For example, which is the favored site of VCP for the nucleophilic
attack by phosphine catalyst? What is the role of the phosphine catalyst?
Which stage would be responsible for the proton transfer? In this
work, our motivation is to make the mechanistic scenario clear using
pure computations. Generally, besides the suggested pathways in the
experiment, other possible pathways (Scheme 2) should be carefully designed and checked
for comparison. Three possible routes are designed for the reaction
in this work. Routes 1 and 2 are associated with the addition of phosphine
at C3 and C1 positions of the keto-type reactant, respectively. After
keto–enol tautomerism, route 3 corresponds to reaction pathways
of the enol-type reactant. Note that the ring-closure steps in route
3 would be common for routes 1 and 2.

Scheme 2 Three Possible Routes
for the Rearrangement of Vinylcyclopropylketone
2 Computational Details
All of the relevant
geometries were fully optimized using dispersion-included
ωB97XD density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the
self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) method.8 The standard 6-31+G(d,p) basis set was used in computations. After
geometry optimization, harmonic vibrational analyses were performed
at the same level to confirm that each minimum had no imaginary frequency
or each transition state (TS) had only one imaginary frequency. The
minimum energy path (MEP) was also traced using the intrinsic reaction
coordinate (IRC) method to ensure that each TS structure is correctly
linked to two minima.9 The implicit C-PCM
solvent model was adopted to evaluate the solvent effect on the reaction
in toluene (ε = 2.374).10 To refine
the energies, we, therefore, performed single-point energy calculations
at the B2PLYP-D3/6-31+G(d,p) level.11 To
match the experimental condition, the obtained thermal energies were
corrected at 110 °C and 1 atm. Finally, the corresponding total
energies of each species were obtained by the sum of single-point
electronic energy (B2PLYP-D3) and thermal corrections of ωB97XD
at 110 °C. Furthermore, some electronic structures were analyzed
by the natural bond orbital (NBO) method.12 All computations were fulfilled with Gaussian 09 program.13 All three-dimensional (3-D) structures were
generated by CYLview program.14

For
practical reasons, it is common in quantum mechanics (QM) and
statistic mechanics computations to estimate entropy using the ideal
gas model. However, the translational and rotational motions would
be suppressed in solution, reducing the entropy as compared to the
gas phase. Especially, for a bimolecular reaction in solution, the
relative entropy would be overestimated in computations if the uncorrected
total gas-phase entropy of separated molecules is taken as the reference.
Therefore, some methods were suggested to estimate the entropy in
solution.15a For example, discarding translational
and/or rotational entropy, scaling methods, and so on. Yu et al. reported
that the experimental activation entropy would be 50–60% of
the computational entropy in the attacking step of phosphine in electron-deficient
alkenes.15b Deubel et al. proposed to simply
use a correction factor (0.5) for the entropy contribution on the
free energy (ΔGcorrected = ΔHsol + (1/2)TΔSgas).15c The Trouton’s
rule states that the entropy of vaporization is almost the same (ca.
20–21 cal/(K mol)) for various kinds of liquids. In this work,
we found that, if the scaling factor of 0.5 was used in the attacking
step (see details in the Supporting Information and Section 3), the
relative entropy would be reduced by 19 cal/(K mol), close to the
Trouton’s rule. So, an average value, i.e., 20 cal/(K mol),
was directly subtracted from the computational entropies in the calculation
of the relative free energies. Note that this correction method only
influences the bimolecular reaction step (e.g., phosphine-attacking
step).

3 Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, two types (keto
and enol) of precursors possibly exist in the reaction
via keto–enol tautomerism. Accordingly, four conformers were
considered in our computations. Energies of two reactants Re-1 and Re-2 are very close. The energy difference is about
1.4 kcal/mol between their enol tautomers (Tau-1 and Tau-2). However, the energies of enol tautomers are about
13 kcal/mol higher than those of keto reactants, indicating that the
major population would be keto structures in the reaction. Starting
from the keto or enol conformers, some possible channels are shown
in Scheme 2.

Figure 1 Geometries
(bond length in Å) of reactants and tautomers along
with relative energies (in parenthesis) and Gibbs free energies (kcal/mol).

Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), including a double bond
installed at
cyclopropane, would be more active for ring-opening because of π–σ*
or σ–π* conjugation. NBO results indicate that
the second-order stabilization energy (E2) is 6.58 kcal/mol for the interaction of π(C1=C2) →
σ*(C3–C4) in Re-1. In Tau-1, E2 energies of π(C1=C2)
→ σ*(C3–C4), π(C6=C7) → σ*(C3–C4),
and σ(C3–C4) → π*(C8=O2) are 7.86,
5.68, and 11.45 kcal/mol, rendering the C3–C4 bond longer (1.562
Å) and weaker. As shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information, the Wiberg bond order of the C2–C3
bond is 0.879 and 0.858 in Re-1 and Tau-1, respectively. After comparing the C1 and C3 positions (see details
in the following section), it would be more favorable for the phosphine
catalyst to attack the three-membered ring (C3 position) than the
terminal of alkene (C1 position). In this article, we mainly report
the reaction processes where the C3 position is attacked by phosphine
catalyst.

3.1 Process Starting from Keto Structures (Route
1)
Figure 2 shows the relative energies along with the reaction process, and
the corresponding geometries are depicted in Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information). Although we optimized
a weak complex CM-1 on the PBu3-catalyzed
pathway from Re-1 to TS-1, the binding energy
is only 2.21 kcal/mol after being corrected by the basis set superposition
error (0.66 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the uncorrected and corrected
relative entropies are −32.3 and −12.3 cal/(mol K),
contributing 12.4 and 4.7 kcal/mol to the −TΔS term of the relative free energy, respectively.
In this sense, the complex CM-1 would be unstable (ΔG > 0).

Figure 2 Relative energies (in parenthesis) and Gibbs free energies
(kcal/mol)
for the reaction processes of route 1.

Starting from Re-1 or Re-2, SN2-type transition states TS-1 or TS-1′ toward ring-opening were optimized. Except for the orientation of
acetyl groups, the two transition states are very similar. The C3–C4
bond distances are 2.132 and 2.060 Å; the C3–P bond distances
are 2.552 and 2.557 Å. Both vibrational modes of imaginary frequencies
are mainly associated with the coupling of the C3–C4 and C3–P
bond stretches. The Wiberg bond order of the C3–C4 bond in TS-1 is 0.266, which is 0.61 less than that in the reactant RE-1. However, the Wiberg bond order of the C3–P bond
increases to 0.37 in TS-1. The result of IRC tracking
is shown in Figure 3. Although the decrease in the C3–P bond distance occurs simultaneously
with the increase of the C3–C4 bond distance, the ring-opening
step would be an asynchronous SN2-type nucleophilic attack
in the view of the evolution of the bond order. Namely, the cleavage
of the C3–C4 bond toward ring-opening would be prior to the
formation of the C3–P bond. This scenario is also found in
the DABCO-catalyzed reaction and would be wrongly suggested to be
a SN1 reaction in the experiment.7,16 Then,
zwitterionic intermediates Int-1 and Int-1′ are formed in the reaction. Due to the conjugation and delocalization,
the formal negative charge center (C4) is stabilized by the effect
of the electron-withdrawing acetyl groups.

Figure 3 IRC profiles along with
evolutions of the C–C and C–P
bond distance (Å) for TS-1 (A) and TS-2 (B).

It is found that the ΔG‡ of TS-1 and TS-1′ are 20.4 and
21.6 kcal/mol from Re-1 with the corrected entropy contributions
(see Tables S2 and S3 in the Supporting
Information). In other words, the two transition states would have
an almost equal chance to occur in the reaction.

Next, the proton
transfer would occur from methyl to C4 atom (see Int-2 in Figure 2) or O1
atom (see Int-3 or Int-3′ in Figure 4). Accurately
computing the barrier of the proton transfer is an open question.
To directly calculate the process of the proton transfer without the
assistance of water (or a proton shuttle), the energy barrier should
be dramatically high (>50 kcal/mol) for the 1,3-proton transfer
because
of the strain energy of the four-membered cyclic transition state.17 To narrow the energy barrier, it usually builds
a bridge (such as water) to facilitate the proton transfer. Water
can act as a proton shuttle and microsolvent. In this way, it should
be reasonably considered how to arrange water molecules to help the
proton transfer in the computation. Encouraged by our previous work,18 the water cluster including twelve explicit
water molecules was tested for the proton transfer.19 Two water molecules build a bridge on the demand of the
proton transfer and others are considered as microsolvent environment
to stabilize the water bridge. It is found that the proton, transferred
from the water solvent, would be very easy to add at the C4 atom,
generating the “virtual existence” of a hydration hydroxide
ion (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).
Unfortunately, all attempts to locate the corresponding transition
state of proton transfer failed. Simply put, we only keep the two
waters as a bridge for the proton transfer and the corresponding transition
states and relative energies were successfully obtained for the tautomerism
from Int-1′ to Int-2 with the help
of water (see Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information). It turns out that this proton transfer would overcome
the 23.8 kcal/mol barrier. The subtraction of α-H from C7 is
slower than the addition of a proton onto C4. To our delight, stabilized
by two water molecules, the relative free energy from Int-1′ to Int-2 decreases by about 7 kcal/mol (18.6 vs 11.6
kcal/mol). We imagine that ΔG‡ or ΔG would decrease more if more water molecules
(water cluster) are considered in the proton transfer. Anyway, we
believe that this proton transfer would be favorable and has a strong
ability to compete against other reaction pathways if trace water
exists in the reaction.

free energies (kcal/mol)
for the reaction processes in channel 2 of route 3.

Then, the transition state SN2′-type
7-endo-trig TS-2, associated with constructing
the C1–C7 bond to furnish the seven-membered cyclic product,
was also successfully obtained. In TS-2, the bond distance
of C1–C7 is 1.984 Å and the vibrational mode of imaginary
frequency almost corresponds to the C1–C7 bond stretch. Both
the IRC result (Figure 3) and the vibrational mode of imaginary frequency confirm that this
7-endo-trig ring closure would be strongly asynchronous
because the C1–C7 bond is formed much before the cleavage of
the C3–P bond. Interestingly, a plateau occurs in the IRC profile
after the formation of the C1–C7 bond. It is found that the
formal negative center moves from C7 to C2 in the plateau region and
that the hybridization of C2 changes from sp2 to sp3. Therefore, the 7-endo-trig SN2′ would be well described as an addition/elimination stepwise
process. Namely, followed by the nucleophilic addition of alkene with
α carbanion to form the C1–C7 bond, it would undergo
the elimination of PBu3 through an E1cb-like mechanism.

Although ΔG‡ in this elementary
step is 26.0 kcal/mol from Int-2, the total ΔG‡ reaches 41.1 kcal/mol including the
proton transfer from Int-1′ to TS-2 in this rate-limiting step. As stated above, this barrier would
be significantly reduced by the assistance of water.

Likewise,
the Cloke–Wilson rearrangement was also comparatively
studied in this work (channel 3 of route 1).6 Starting from Int-1′, the transition state TS-3 is associated with the C3–O bond formation toward
dihydrofuran. Distances of the C3–O and C3–P bonds are
2.048 and 2.472 Å, respectively. This transition state is also
asynchronous with the confirmation that the C3–O bond is formed
earlier than the cleavage of the C3–P bond. The corresponding
ΔG‡ is 26.6 kcal/mol from Int-1′. In this sense, the Cloke–Wilson rearrangement
(TS-3) would be somewhat fast or strongly compete with
7-endo-trig ring closure (TS-2) from Int-1′. Note that the energy of Pr-3 is
close to that of Int-1′, indicating that the formation
of dihydrofuran would be a resting state in the reaction.

By
the way, the rearrangement of vinylcyclopropane to cyclopentene
(VCP–CP) (channel 4 of route 1) was also checked.3c The results exhibit that it would be difficult
to undergo this transformation via a 5-endo-trig
SN2′-type ring closure process, which coincides with no detection
of cyclopentene in the experiment. This disadvantage of transformation
would be explained by Baldwin’s rules.

3.2 Process
Starting from Enol Structures (Channel
2 of Route 3)
Starting from Tau-1 and Tau-2 as shown in Figure 1, the transition states TS-4 and TS-4′ associated with PBu3 attacking cyclobutene
(C3 position) were optimized (Figure 4). The relevant geometries are depicted in Figure S4 (see the Supporting Information). The
C3–C4 bond distance is almost equal (2.182 Å) in TS-4 and TS-4′, whereas the C3–P
bond distances are 2.498 and 2.333 Å, respectively. In TS-4, due to the coplanar character, more orbital interaction
and hydrogen bonding lead to more conjugation of the two electron
withdrawing groups (EWG) with a negative C4 center. The corresponding
ΔG‡ is 22.4 and 27.8 kcal/mol,
respectively. If the keto–enol tautomerism is included, this
attacking mode would be difficult to achieve in the reaction (ΔG‡ would be 36.9 and 40.4 kcal/mol for TS-4 and TS-4′, respectively).

Then,
it offers intermediates Int-3 and Int-3′. Note that although they would not be generated by direct ring-opening
of enol structures by phosphine catalyst, they could be alternatively
transformed from keto-type intermediates Int-1, Int-1′, or Int-2. We think that this transformation
would also be likely with the help of water.

Next, 7-endo-trig transition states TS-5 and TS-5′ were also optimized in the formation
of seven-membered cyclic products. Both the IRC result and the vibrational mode obviously indicate that
the 7-endo-trig process of enol type is very similar
to that of the keto type. Namely, it is also an addition/elimination
sequential process.

Similarly, although ΔG‡ of the elementary step is 18.6 kcal/mol, the
total ΔG‡ reaches 41.6 kcal/mol,
including the
proton transfer in this rate-limiting step from Int-1′ to TS-5. Because of the almost equal barriers (41.1
vs 41.6 kcal/mol), we cannot rule out one between the keto-type TS-2 and the enol-type TS-5.

In all, by
gathering the available information, the suggested reaction
scenario is concisely depicted in Figure 5. The first stage is the SN2-type
ring-opening of the keto-type reactant with the phosphine catalyst.
After the proton-transfer tautomerisms of the zwitterionic intermediates,
the second stage is associated with the 7-endo-trig
SN2′-type asynchronous ring closure of enol or keto
zwitterions to afford seven-membered ring products and recover the
catalyst. Additionally, the resting state (dihydrofuran) would exist
in the reaction. Importantly, after the proton shift, the nonconjugate
in Int-2 and the hydrogen bond in Int-3 would
retard the Cloke–Wilson rearrangement (TS-3) to
generate the resting state. As shown in Figure 4, enol-type product (Pr-2) is
slightly stable than the keto-type product (Pr-1) by
about 2 kcal/mol, supporting the observation of 85% experimental yield
of enol product in the reaction.5

energies (in parenthesis) and Gibbs free energies (kcal/mol) in key
steps. Underlined values are the total activation barriers that include
the relative energies (free energies) of the proton-transfer tautomerisms.

3.3 Uncatalyzed Process via
[3,3]-σ Rearrangement
(Channel 1 of Route 3)
To clarify the role of catalyst, the
uncatalyzed process via [3,3]-σ rearrangement was also considered
as a comparative study. Optimized geometries are depicted in Figure S5 (see the Supporting Information). Figure 6 shows that the values
of total ΔG‡ are 28.5 and
31.8 kcal/mol for TS-6 and TS-7 from Re-1, respectively. Compared with the above-mentioned PBu3-catalyzed processes, the uncatalyzed processes might be somewhat
competitive. Why it does not work without the catalyst in the experiment?
We think that it would be favorable for the PBu3-catalyzed
ring-opening of the keto-type reactant to generate a zwitterionic
intermediate in the first reaction stage and that the barrier of the
water-assisted proton transfer would reduce more if more water molecules
are considered. For example, after considering only two water molecules,
as discussed above, ΔG‡ reduces
from 41 to 34 kcal/mol in the rate-limiting step from Int-1′ to TS-2. The detailed proton-transfer processes, including
more accurate computational model and method, are being performed
by our group and will be reported separately in the future.

for the uncatalyzed reaction processes in channel 1 of route 3.

3.4 Possible Pathways via the
Addition at C1 Position
by PBu3 (Route 2 and Channel 3 of Route 3)
As
shown in Figures 7 and 8, both keto- and enol-type precursors are taken
as the starting geometries. Optimized geometries are depicted in Figures S6 and S7 (see the Supporting Information).
The corresponding processes also include two stages: SN2′-type nucleophilic addition for the ring-opening of vinylcyclopropylketone
and SN2-type 7-endo-trig ring closure
of the seven-membered cyclic product. However, compared with the attack
at the C3 position, ΔG‡ of
the C1 site addition is higher to some extent. In this sense, the
ring-opening vinylcyclopropylketone at C1 position using the steric
free catalyst would be unlikely.

Figure 7 Relative energies (in parenthesis) and
Gibbs free energies (kcal/mol)
for the reaction processes in route 2.

Figure 8 Relative
energies (in parenthesis) and Gibbs free energies (kcal/mol)
for the reaction processes in channel 3 of route 3.

To make clear the difference in the reactivities between
C1 and
C3 positions, the ring-opening process was scanned along with the
C3–C5–C4 angle expansion starting from the reactant. Figure 9 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information show that
the relative natural charges at C1 and C3 atoms gradually become more
positive in the ring-opening process. The C3 atom loses electron more
rapidly than the C1 atom, rendering the C3 atom more active for the
nucleophilic attack of PBu3. Additionally, the complexation
energy was obtained by the counterpoise method at the ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p)
level. The activation barrier is decomposed into ΔEstrain and ΔEint, where
ΔEstrain is associated with the
deformation energy from free reactants (including the catalyst) to
their geometries in the transition state, and ΔEint is the interaction energy between the deformed moieties.
It indicates that ΔEint of PBu3 with the C3 atom in TS-1 (−7.9 kcal/mol)
is lower than that with C1 atom in TS-8 (−2.7
kcal/mol). ΔEstrain of the reactant
in TS-1 and TS-8 are very close (27.3 vs
26.9 kcal/mol), whereas ΔEstrain of PBu3 catalyst is small (0.7 vs 1.4 kcal/mol). Therefore,
the strong electron deficiency and high interaction energy would be
responsible for the high reactivity of the C3 position in the nucleophilic
attack of PBu3.

the ring-opening
process (Δq is relative to the reactant).

3.5 Other Possibilities Related
with Phosphine
Catalyst Acting as a Base or an Oxygenphile
Phosphine could
act as a nucleophile or an oxygenphile. The possibility of the direct
attack at C=O of the acetyl group in the keto-type reactant
was also examined. The corresponding structure is unstable, and the
zwitterion could not be successfully located via the formation of
the C–P bond (see structure A in Figure 10). For other possible structures, the results
show that the relative energies are somewhat high or that they need
the formation of the enol-type reactant first. By the way, if the
α carbanion was generated with the α-H abstraction by
PBu3, the [3,3]-σ rearrangement would overcome the
16.9 kcal/mol barrier, which is very close to that of the neutral
enol-type transition state TS-7. We think because the
yield of the product did not increase with the amine catalyst in the
experiment, the α-H abstraction would not occur due to the weak
basicity of PBu3. Anyway, these possibilities are safely
ruled out in this work.

4 Conclusions
In this work, the detailed pathways
of the title reaction were
theoretically explored using density functional theory. Both keto-
and enol-type reaction precursors were considered in computations.
Main findings are summarized as follows:(1) The keto-type reactant and its ring-opening
zwitterionic intermediates are more stable than their enol-type counterparts.

(2) It would be more favorable
for the
phosphine catalyst to attack the three-membered ring (C3 position)
than the terminal of alkene (C1 position) in vinylcyclopropylketone.

(3) A two-stage mechanism
was responsible
for the title reaction. The first stage is the SN2-type
ring-opening of the keto-type reactant with phosphine catalyst. After
the proton-transfer tautomerisms of the zwitterionic intermediates,
the second stage is associated with the asynchronous 7-endo-trig SN2′-type ring closure of keto- or enol-type
zwitterion to afford seven-membered cyclic products and recovery of
the catalyst.

(4) The 7-endo-trig SN2′-type ring closure would
be well described as an
addition/elimination sequential process where the C1–C7 bond
formation is much before the cleavage of the C3–P bond.

(5) Water-assisted proton-transfer
tautomerisms
between zwitterionic intermediates are very crucial. The water-assisted
tautomerisms not only accelerate the reaction rate but also suppress
the Cloke–Wilson rearrangement toward the resting state.



Although proton-shift processes are insufficient,
computational
results provide a rational mechanistic scenario and enhance the comprehension
of the experimental observation.

2008 , 10 , 6615 –6620 . 10.1039/b810189b .18989472 b  Different density functional theory (DFT) methods, B3LYP(D3), cam-B3LYP(D3),
M06(D3), M06-2×(D3), PBE0(D3), LC-ωPBE, and ωB97XD,
were tested for a rate-limiting transition state TS-2 (see Table S5
in the supporting information and the section of results). It turns
out the barriers of ωB97XD are very close to those of B3LYP(D3),
M06-2×(D3), and LC-ωPBE. The barriers of cam-B3LYP(D3)
are slightly overestimated, whereas the barriers of PBE0(D3) and M06(D3)
are underestimated to some extent. Therefore, it would be suitable
to use ωB97XD in this work.
