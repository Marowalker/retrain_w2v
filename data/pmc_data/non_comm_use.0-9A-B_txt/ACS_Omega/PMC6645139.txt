Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an
opportunistic pathogen causing
a variety of severe viral infections, including irreversible congenital
disabilities. Nowadays, HCMV infection is treated by inhibiting the
viral DNA polymerase. However, DNA polymerase inhibitors have several
drawbacks. An alternative strategy is to use compounds against the
packaging machinery or terminase complex, which is essential for viral
replication. Our discovery that raltegravir (1), a human
immunodeficiency virus drug, inhibits the nuclease function of UL89,
one of the protein subunits of the complex, prompted us to further
develop terminase inhibitors. On the basis of the structure of 1, a library of diketoacid (α,γ-DKA and β,δ-DKA)
derivatives were synthesized and tested for UL89-C nuclease activity.
The mode of action of α,γ-DKA derivatives on the UL89
active site was elucidated by using X-ray crystallography, molecular
docking, and in vitro experiments. Our studies identified α,γ-DKA
derivative 14 able to inhibit UL89 in vitro in the low
micromolar range, making 14 an optimal candidate for
further development and virus-infected cell assay.

Introduction
Human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV), one of the eight known human herpesviruses,
is widespread with a high prevalence throughout the human population.2 HCMV causes severe diseases and life-threatening
conditions in immune-compromised individuals, such as acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, and organ transplant patients, neonates, and young children.2 It is the leading congenital infection in developed
countries, causing a number of neural abnormalities including hearing
loss, mental retardation, and microcephalia. The drugs licensed so
far for the treatment of HCMV infection are the antisense oligonucleotide
fomivirsen and four viral DNA polymerase inhibitors: ganciclovir (GCV),
valganciclovir, cidofovir (CDV), and foscarnet (FOS).3 There are several disadvantages associated with the use
of these drugs including (i) poor bioavailability, (ii) serious side
effects induced by prolonged treatment, and (iii) emergence of resistant
viral strains.4 Development of drug resistance
is associated with an aggressive clinical course, organ dysfunction,
and mortality.5 Several cases of multidrug
resistance to GCV, CDV, and FOS have been reported.6 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development
of new drugs with a different mode of action, good bioavailability,
and a safer pharmacological profile. Novel classes of antiviral compounds
able to target viral entry, transcription, protein synthesis and processing,
genome replication, or maturation have been identified.3,7−14 Among these, a promising strategy is to block the HCMV terminase
machinery1 which mediates DNA binding,
cleavage, and packaging because these processes do not occur in mammalian
cells and therefore specific terminase inhibitors could have fewer
undesirable side effects.

HCMV replicates its genome as concatamers
that are large DNA molecules
with several copies of the genome. Afterward, these are cut into single
unit-length genome and packaged inside the capsids by the HCMV terminase
machinery.15 HCMV terminase is a protein
complex composed of UL56, UL89, and UL51 responsible for binding,
cleavage, and translocation of viral DNA inside the procapsids, respectively.15−17 The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the nuclease domain of UL89
was determined by X-ray crystallography,18 whereas the structures of UL56 and UL51 are not elucidated yet.

Letermovir, a 3,4-dihydro-quinazoline-4-yl-acetic acid derivative,
a non-nucleoside inhibitor with a potent antiviral activity, specific
against the viral terminase subunit pUL56,19,20 has been developed by AiCuris GmbH & Co KG and is currently
in a phase III clinical study.21 An alternative
approach consists of targeting UL89, another subunit of the terminase
complex, which contains two domains, the C-terminal region (UL89-C,
418-674), which has proved nuclease activity,16,18,22 and the N-terminal part (UL89-N, 1-417),
which has putative adenosinetriphosphatase activity.23−25 UL89 inhibitors may be designed to block the adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP) binding site on the UL89-N region; amongst them, there are 2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (Figure S1), 2,5,6-trichloro-1-(β-d-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole,
2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribopyranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (GW275175X), and 3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-N-[4([[5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthyl]sulfonyl]amino)-phenyl]propanamide
(BAY 38-4766), which interact with the ATP binding site and induce
mutations on the UL89-N domain.15,26−32 However, in spite of the efforts, none of them have reached the
market.3,7,8 The presence
of the highly conserved ATP binding motif in many different proteins
could impede to obtain specific inhibitors for the viral UL89-N.33

Another approach is focused on finding
HCMV inhibitors able to
target the nuclease activity of UL89-C. The structure of UL89-C, which
is structurally related to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
integrase,18 exhibits a central eight-stranded
mixed β-sheet, with parallel and antiparallel strands, flanked
on both sides by six α-helices. The nuclease active site of
UL89-C is located in a cleft formed by three loops β2−β3,
β5−α3, and α5−α6. Three acidic
residues Asp463, Asp651, and Glu534 chelate two Mn2+ ions,
which are essential for UL89-C DNA cleavage. An UL89-C nuclease inhibitor
should interact with the two Mn2+ ions and the amino acids
located in the loops to block DNA interaction and cleavage.

Most of the compounds against UL89-C tested so far are divalent
metal-sequestering inhibitors, such as 1-(3-chloro-4-fluorobenzyl)-5-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic
acid34 (Figure S1), an hydroxypyridonecarboxylic (HPC) derivative, and 3-hydroxy-1-methyl-6-((4′-methyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amino)dihydropyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione35 (Figure S1), a 3-hydroxypyrimidine-2,4-dione
(HPD) derivative. HPC and HPD compounds inhibit the nuclease activity
of UL89-C in the low micromolar range (IC50 = 2.2 and 1
μM, respectively), HCMV replication, and infectious virus production
in cell culture.35 Therefore, there is
a correlation between blocking of pUL89 endonuclease activity and
inhibition of HCMV replication and viral genome cleavage. Recently,
2,7-dihydroxy-4-(propan-2-yl)cyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-one (Figure S1) with metal-chelating motifs was identified
as an inhibitor of pUL15C of herpes simplex viruses 1, a homologue
of pUL89-C.36 Crystallographic studies
of 2,7-dihydroxy-4-(propan-2-yl)cyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-one binding
to the nuclease active site of bacteriophage terminase gp2 nuclease
domain revealed that the interaction is mainly mediated by the two
metal ions (PDB code: 5C2F).37

Previous studies
have reported the structure–activity relationships
(SARs) of UL89 inhibitors explained by molecular docking simulation,
using the apo form of UL89, without the possibility to validate docking
binding mode because there is no UL89-inhibitor complex available.
Clearly, it is important to have an understanding of the interactions
of UL89 inhibitors with UL89 and offer detailed information to drive
a target-based drug discovery program against HCMV. We have focused
our efforts on elucidating the 3D structural data of UL89 inhibitors
with UL89-C.18 In our previous report,
we found that pUL89-C endonuclease activity was inhibited by the HIV
inhibitor raltegravir (1, Figure 1), suggesting that inhibiting pUL89-C is
possible using a similar metal-chelating pharmacophore.18

Figure 1 Rational design of 14 as the UL89-C inhibitor.

On the basis of computational
molecular docking studies of 1 (Figure S2A), the pivotal chemical
regions of 1 binding pUL89-C endonuclease domain active
site were identified. Upon definition of the chemical features, a
new set of compounds was designed to improve the inhibition activity.
Herein, we present the synthesis and evaluation of a library of small
organic compounds able to inhibit UL89-C nuclease activity in an in
vitro enzymatic assay. The ability of these compounds to bind UL89-C
was tested by thermal denaturation. Furthermore, the X-ray structure
of a protein–ligand complex unveiled the precise binding mode
of the ligand in the enzyme active site, allowing a further structure-driven
antiviral development against UL89-C activity.

Results and Discussion
Rational
Design and Chemistry
Our rational design began
by simplifying the structure of 1, a HIV integrase inhibitor,
by selecting chemical features important for UL89-C binding. Computational
docking studies of 1 in the active site of UL89-C highlighted
a number of molecular interactions that contribute to binding affinity
(Figure S2A). The pivotal regions of 1 binding the pUL89-C active site are the metal chelator group
and the benzyl group. The three coplanar oxygen atoms of the diketo
acid (DKA) moiety chelate Mn2+ ions in the active site,
explaining the requirement for metal ions for drug binding. The central
oxygen, O(H), bridges both metal ions, whereas two O (carbonyl) coordinates
the metal ions (Figure S2A). Additionally,
the terminal phenyl ring interacts with Asn536 (distance = 3.74 Å),
Met579 (3.30 Å), and Thr537 (4.66 Å). These interactions
could help position the inhibitor near the divalent metal cations
in the active site. The five-membered oxadiazole moiety and isopropyl
group are not directly involved into interactions with the UL89-C
binding site (distance oxadiazole-Phe466 > 6.24 Å).

On
this basis, we designed 2 containing an α,γ-DKA
motif linked to a 4-fluorophenyl ring (Figures 1 and 2A). The α,γ-DKA
core, a privileged structure found in thousands of HIV integrase inhibitors
with IC50 values in low micromolar concentrations,38−45 is able to chelate Mn2+46 (Figure S2A) and able to disrupt DNA–protein
interactions.38,43,45,47−49 The α,γ-DKA
motif has also been successfully used as a starting point to obtain
inhibitors against (1) hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase,50 (2) HIV-reverse transcriptase RNase H,51 (3) hepatitis C virus NS5b polymerase,52 and (4) influenza endonuclease.53 The 4-fluorophenyl ring is a common motif found in 1 and other inhibitors.

To validate our binding pose predictions and to
facilitate further
structural modifications, we determined the crystal structure of UL89-C
bound with 2 (PDB code 6EY7). The elucidation of the binding mode
of 2 in the UL89-C binding site by X-ray crystallography
(see below and Figure 2A) and the finding of 2 able to inhibit UL89-C prompted
us to enlarge the α,γ-DKA series (3–17, Schemes 1 and 2). The substituents on the aromatic ring (3–4), amide (5), carboxylic acid (6–7), and benzylic (8–17) positions
were studied to determine SAR of the series. The fluoride atom of 2 was substituted with iodine (3) and bromine
(4). In 5, the methyl group of the amide
portion was exchanged for a bulkier alkyl substituent. Furthermore,
the carboxylic functionality of 2 was converted to an
amide (6–7). The 4-fluorobenzyl and the N-methyl-4-fluorobenzylamine groups of 2 were
exchanged with a CH3 group to give 8 and 9, respectively. Different planar (hetero)aromatic rings,
variously decorated, have been added to the α,γ-DKA chelating
core (10–17) to promote a π–π
stacking interaction with Phe466.

Yield)
On the basis of the remarkable
profile shown by α,γ-DKA
derivatives, 18, lacking the α,γ-DKA core
required to achieve chelation, was used as the negative control. The
synthesis of compounds 2–5 and 8 was
straightforward and was accomplished in three reaction steps. In the
first step, the primary amine (2c–5c, Scheme 1) was acetylated
under standard conditions to afford the intermediate 2b–5b. The preparation of intermediates 2a–5a was
achieved by treating 2b–5b with dimethyl oxalate.
Then, 2a–5a were hydrolyzed to afford the corresponding
acid derivatives (2–5).44,54,55 Compounds 6 and 7 were obtained by coupling methylamine and 4-fluorobenzylamine, respectively,
with 2. Compounds 8–9 and 13 were prepared by basic hydrolysis of 8a–9a and 13a (Scheme 2).

Finally, on the basis of the structure of a potent HIV integrase
inhibitor MK-2048 (Figure S3A), we substituted
the α,γ-DKA core with a β,δ-DKA chelating
group (19–20 and Figure S3A). The synthesis of 19–20 (Scheme 3) started from the formation of the dihydropyridone
core (23), which was subsequently ethylated giving 22 and then partially hydrolyzed obtaining 21.56−58 Afterward, 19b and 20b were obtained by
coupling benzylamines with 21, using amide coupling reagents.
Finally, ester derivatives 19b and 20b were
converted to 19 and 20, respectively.

UL89-C/2 Complex Structure
To study the
binding mode of 2, we determined the 3D crystal structure
of the UL89-C/2 complex (PDB code 6EY7). Diffraction data
collected from crystals of UL89-C soaked with Mn2+ and 2 were solved by molecular replacement, using the solved inhibitor-free
UL89-C as the initial model.18 Strong electron
density within the active site was observed adjacent to the Mn2+ ions (Figure S2B).

The
UL89-C/2 structure was refined to 2.9 Å resolution
(Table 2). The UL89-C/2 crystal also showed anomalous scattering, confirming the
presence of two Mn2+ ions in the active site. As expected, 2 bound through the α,γ-DKA core to the two Mn2+ ions in the active site (Figure 2B). The three adjacent oxygen atoms of the
α,γ-DKA fragment chelated the two Mn2+ ions
in a pairwise fashion such that the central oxygen atom was bridging
the two ions (Figure 2B). Thus, the Mn2+ ions were coordinated by two acidic
residues (Glu534-Asp463 or Asp463-Asp651) from UL89-C and two oxygen
atoms of 2 (Figure 2B) in a tetrahedral geometry. An identical coordination
pattern has been observed between the active site of LACV L-protein
and an α,γ-DKA derivative.59 All four compounds in the asymmetric unit of the UL89-C/2 crystals showed clear electron density for the orientation displayed
in Figure 2A. The complex
UL89-C/2 also revealed that the 4-fluorobenzyl group
blocks a region crucial for DNA/UL89-C recognition. To further confirm
the presence of 2 in the UL89-C/2 complex,
we exchanged the fluorine atom for iodine (3) or bromine
(4) atom because both are able to originate measurable
anomalous scattering effects. Indeed, the anomalous difference maps
confirmed the presence of the iodine atom of 3 in the
UL89-C/3 complex (Table 2). The position of the iodine atom on the UL89-C/3 complex overlaps with the fluorine atom of 2 found in UL89-C/2 (Figure S2C). On the basis of the crystallographic studies on UL89-C/2 and UL89-C/3, the α,γ-DKA chelating core
served as the metal-binding motif and the 4-fluorophenyl ring afforded
additional interactions with the hydrophobic cleft formed by Asn536
and Met579 (Figure 2B,C). The methyl group of 2, pointing outside the binding
site, may be substituted with a bulky alkyl group to get an additional
hydrophobic interaction with the close Phe466 (Figure 2B,C). The carboxylic acid interacted with
Ser473 by hydrogen bonds with a distance of 3.6 Å (Figure 2C).

Inhibition of UL89-C Nuclease
Activity
A quantitative
UL89-C nuclease assay was designed to evaluate the inhibition potency
of 1–20. These compounds passed through a pan
assay interference compounds filter (http://zinc15.docking.org/patterns/home/).60

Linear DNA and UL89-C were
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1–20 at a concentration of 50 μM. Linear DNA was run on an agarose
gel electrophoresis gel, stained with Syto 60, and quantified by fluorescence
analysis. The compounds revealed a percentage of inhibition ranging
from totally inactive (0%) to almost complete inhibition (97%) (Table 1). At 50 μM, 1 and 2 showed similar inhibition (36.6 and 56.2%)
but with an improvement of the percentage efficiency index (PEI) (defined
as the percentage of inhibition at a given concentration/molecular
weight) from 0.08 to 0.15 because of the lower molecular weight of 2 (Figure 1).

Using a novel
enzyme-linked inmunosorbent assay format as a screening
assay, Wang et al. found that 1 inhibited pUL89-C activity
with a IC50 of 96 μM. These results are in a good
agreement with the inhibitory response in our assay.34

The comparable activity of 1 and 2 corroborated
our hypothesis that an α,γ-DKA scaffold linked to a 4-fluorophenyl
group was the minimum motif required to modulate the UL89-C nuclease
activity. We studied the importance of each individual group, α,γ-DKA
and 4-fluorophenyl, in the contribution to the inhibition of the activity
of UL89C by analyzing the activity of both fragments separately, 2b and 8 (Figure S3B), and we confirmed our hypothesis that they were unable to inhibit
UL89-C activity (Table 1).

On the basis of the UL89-C/2 complex structure,
several
α,γ-DKA compounds decorated with different (hetero)aromatic
groups spanning a wide range of size, aromaticity, and H-bond capability
(3–17) were selected for further studies. The
substitution of the fluorine atom of 2 for iodine (3) or bromine (4) slightly improved the activity
(47.7 and 51.5%, respectively). The substitution of the methyl group
of 2 for a cyclopropyl ring (5) showed an
improvement of potency from 37.4 to 76.3%. The improved activity of 5 might be related to the additional interaction between the
cyclopropyl fragment and Phe466. Derivatization of the carboxylic
acid functionality to an amide (6 and 7)
led to inactive compounds, confirming the crucial role of the electrostatic
interaction between the carboxyl group with Mn2+. The replacement
of the aromatic ring of 2 with a methyl (8 and 9, Scheme 2) resulted in a complete loss of activity as well, pointing
to a possible role for the aromatic substituent in the recognition
process. Altogether, these preliminary results suggested that an α,γ-DKA
scaffold linked to a bulky aromatic substituent might contribute to
UL89-C inhibition. Starting from this assumption, we were keen to
examine the effects of different (hetero)aromatic substituents on
the α,γ-DKA system. To this end, derivatives 10–17 (Scheme 2) were assayed.
Derivatives bearing an electron-rich aromatic ring such as 4-methylphenyl
(12), phenylpiperidine (14), or a heteroaromatic
ring (17) exhibited high inhibitory activity (89.1–97.2%).
Instead α,γ-DKA compounds bearing an electron-deficient
aromatic ring such as a 4-fluorophenyl (11), 4-trifluoromethylphenyl
(13), or 4-pyridyl (15) showed low inhibition
at 50.0 μM. Structural changes introduced in the metal-chelating
motif, as in 18, greatly affected the ability of the
inhibitor to bind to the active site. On top of that, the alteration
of the α,γ-DKA chelating core by an α,δ-DKA
(19 and 20) made the compounds unable to
chelate the metal ions in the active site.

To estimate the IC50 values, the concentrations of 1-5, 10, 12, and 14–17 were lowered to
25, 12.5, 6.2, and 3.1 μM, respectively, in
the fluorescent UL89-C nuclease assay. At a lower concentration (25
μM), 1–4 showed low activity, meanwhile
compound 5, bearing a cyclopropyl group on nitrogen atom,
showed the highest activity between derivatives 1–5; this might be due to an additional hydrophobic interaction with
Phe466. To note, the halogen atom (fluorine, iodine, or bromine) attached
to the phenyl group (2–4) does influence the inhibitory
potency of α,γ-DKA compounds to UL89-C. Among 10–17, we observed that α,γ-DKA compounds bearing a pyridine
ring (15), a 4-fluorobenzene (11), or a
4-trifluoromethyl-benzene (13) have low inhibitory activity
against UL89-C. This might be due to the substituent effect on the
electrostatic potential of the benzene ring. A strong dependence on
the electrostatic potential of the aromatic ring and UL89-C affinity
is suggested. Compounds bearing a benzene ring decorated with substituents
such as CF3 or F have shown to be less potent than compounds
bearing electron-donating groups such as NR2 or CH.61,62 As expected, lowering further the concentration to 12.5 and 6.25
μM, 5, 10, 12, and 16 showed a reduced percentage of inhibition (22.6–32.7%, Table 1), whereas 14 and 17 still showed good potency against UL89-C (65
and 80%, respectively). The estimated IC50 values for 14 and 17 are 4.5 and 9.2 μM, respectively
(Figure S4A,B). Furthermore, 14 showed a PEI of 0.35, four times greater than that of 1 (PEI = 0.08, Figure 1). The high activity of 14 might be due, as predicted
by docking simulation, to a strong π–π interaction
between Phe466 and the electron-rich aromatic ring of 14 (Figure 2D). From
the focused library of α,γ-DKA, we identified that the
minimal structural determinant for the UL89-C activity is an α,γ-DKA
group linked to an electron-rich aromatic ring (Figure S15).

Thermal Shift Assay
Protein melting
temperature (Tm) determined by thermal
shift assays (TSAs)
is used to monitor ligand effects on protein stability.63 The interaction of a ligand with the protein
usually causes an increase in Tm. TSA
was used to study the thermal stabilization of UL89-C upon binding
of 14, 17, and 18, and the
latter was used as a negative control (Figure 3). Tm of ligand-free
UL89-C was 52.7 °C (in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Tm was 52.0 °C). A significant rise in Tm was observed for 14 (Tm = 55.7 °C) and 17 (Tm = 55.5 °C), confirming their ability
to bind UL89-C and stabilizing the protein. 18 did not
stabilize the protein (Tm = 52.5 °C, Figure 3), thus confirming
lack of binding to UL89-C. These results further suggested that the
α,γ-DKA core was a crucial motif required for UL89-C inhibition.

used as the negative control. Values are the mean ± standard
deviation (SD) (n = 3).

Docking
Molecular docking studies were conducted to
elucidate the binding mode of UL89-C inhibitors in the active site
for the noncrystallized complexes. The atomic coordinates of the UL89-C
active site were used for computational docking of 1, 2, 14, and 17 (Figures S2A, 2D, and S2D). The binding pose of 1 showed that (i) the
chelating motif was positioned close to the two Mn2+ cations,
(ii) the 4-fluorobenzyl substituent interacted by hydrophobic interaction
with Asn536 and Met579, and (iii) the oxadiazole fragment is not directly
involved in the interactions with the UL89-C binding site. The predicted
binding pose of 2 showed the same orientation of groups
i and ii as 1. The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd)
between the docked and crystallographic poses of 2 on
the UL89-C active site is 0.9 Å. Molecular docking simulation
of 14 and 17 demonstrated that the α,γ-DKA
group chelated the two Mn2+ cations and the electron-rich
aromatic ring interacted with the adjacent Phe466 by π–π
interaction (Figures 2D and S2D).

Conclusions
UL89
HCMV terminase is a promising antiviral target because of
its key role in the processing and packaging of the viral DNA inside
the capsid, during viral replication. Blocking this crucial step could
avoid the spread of the infection. We have focused our efforts on
developing potential inhibitors against UL89-C because its nuclease
activity is exclusive to the virus. On the basis of the structure
of 1, a weak inhibitor of UL89-C, we designed 2. Compound 2, bearing an α,γ-DKA scaffold
linked to a 4-fluorophenyl group, is able to inhibit UL89-C activity.
Here, we report the X-ray structure of UL89-C bound to two α,γ-DKA
derivatives (2 and 3) as well as the in
vitro thermal shift and nuclease assays. Our studies showed that the
alterations of the α,γ-DKA scaffold proved to be deleterious
to the activity and the potency was influenced by substituents on
the α,γ-DKA core. Among them, 14, bearing
an α,γ-DKA group linked to an aromatic electron-rich moiety,
inhibited UL89-C at low micromolar range. The molecular binding of 14 to UL89-C was confirmed by a fluorescence-based thermal
stability assay and its binding interactions were predicted by molecular
docking simulation. Considering the strong correlation found with
UL89 inhibitors against UL89 enzyme and antiviral potency,34,3514 is an optimal candidate to be tested in HCMV-infected
cells. Moreover, several DKA derivatives have exhibited low cytotoxicity
in vitro64−69 so we expect that 14 would share this feature in vitro
as well. The structural information gained from the UL89-C/2 complex and the identification of the chemical features determining
the UL89-C inhibition will allow further development and optimization
of α,γ-DKA inhibitors against the HCMV UL89-C.

X-ray Crystallography
UL89-C was purified and crystallized
as previously described.18 Crystals of
UL89-C were grown by mixing the protein solution with a solution containing
10% Mes 1 M pH 6.5, 6% PEG8000, and 150 mM calcium acetate in sitting
drop plates at 20 °C for 1 week. The crystal complex between
the UL89-C and the inhibitor was formed by soaking the protein crystals
in a solution containing 1 mM of 2 or 3,
2 mM of MnCl2, 10% Mes 1 M, 6% PEG8000, and 150 mM calcium
acetate. 2 was soaked for one week, and 3 was soaked for 24 h. All crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir
buffer containing 1 mM of 2 in 10% PEG400 or 3 in 20% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to diffraction
analysis. Diffraction data were recorded from cryocooled crystals
(100 K) at the ALBA synchrotron in Barcelona (BL13-XALOC beamline).
Data were integrated and merged using XDS70 and scaled using XSCALE.71 The structure
of the complexes was solved by molecular replacement with the CCP4
supported program MOLREP72,73 using the UL89-C structure
(PDB code 3N4P) as a starting model and refined with Refmac74 and manually checked with Coot.752 was placed (LigandFit, PHENIX supported program)76 and refined (phenix.refine, PHENIX supported
program)77 in the additional electron density
present at the active site pocket. For the UL89-C/3 complex,
anomalous data were collected at wavelength 0.9194 Å and the
difference anomalous map was calculated (Figure S2C). Molecular topologies for 2 and 3 were generated with PRODRG server.78 Data
collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2.

In Vitro Nuclease Assay
Purified UL89-C at a concentration
of 3 μM dissolved in a buffer containing 30 mM Tris pH 8.0 and
50 mM NaCl was mixed with 3 mM MnCl2 and different concentrations
of inhibitors 1–20 (50–3.2 μM) in
DMSO. The concentration of DMSO was 5% in all reactions. The nuclease
activity was started by addition of 100 ng of linear pOPINM vector,
digested with KpnI–HindIII. The reaction was incubated for
30 min at 37 °C. After that time, the reaction was stopped by
addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at a final concentration
of 30 mM. Then, 0.2 μM of Syto 60 stain in a dye-free loading
buffer was added. The samples were incubated for 10 min and loaded
on an agarose gel (1%). Gel electrophoresis was run at 90 V for 45
min in the dark in 1× TAE buffer. The image of the agarose gel
was obtained from the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging equipment. The
nondigested DNA in the reaction was quantified using Odyssey Infrared
Imaging system version 3.0 software, using a control DNA for the measurements.
The percentage of inhibition was obtained from the amount of DNA present
at different concentrations of inhibitors.

Thermal Shift Assay
The aliquots were prepared on ice
in a 96-well polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plate (Bio-Rad) sealed
with optically clear PCR sealers (Bio-Rad) and contained 15 μM
UL89-C, 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, Sypro Orange protein
(Invitrogen), and 0.5 mM MnCl2. Then, 14, 17, and 18 dissolved in DMSO were added at a
final concentration of 25 μM. For the control, the same volume
of DMSO was added to reach a final concentration of 5%. The samples
were heated from 20 to 95 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min, and
the change in fluorescence (λex = 490 nm; λem = 575 nm) was monitored over time in an iCycler iQ Real
Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). All measurements were carried
out in triplicate. Data evaluation and melting point determination
were performed using Bio-Rad Optical System Software.

Computational
Docking Studies
The 3D structures of 1, 2, 14, and 17 were
docked to the crystal structure of UL89-C (PDB code: 3N4P) using AutoDock
v4.2 (Molecular Graphics Lab., The Scripps Research Institute, La
Jolla, CA, USA) available at http://autodock.scripps.edu. The 3D structures of 1, 2, 14, 17, and UL89-C (PDB
code: 3N4P)
were first converted from pdb into pdbqt format using MGL Tools. Gesteiger
partial charges were used for both the enzyme and ligands. The active
site was defined as a grid box centered at the −23.00, 26.75,
and −4.94 coordinates with 0.4 Å units in the x, y, and z directions
to cover the entire binding site. 1, 2, 14, and 17 were docked flexibly into the active
site of the UL89-C structure. Docking simulations were performed with
the following parameters: number of energy evaluations (2 500 000),
genetic algorithm runs (100), and population size (150).79 The representative pose of the most populated
cluster was selected.
