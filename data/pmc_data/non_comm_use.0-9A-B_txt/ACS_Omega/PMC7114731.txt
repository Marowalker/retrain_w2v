An
inimitable urea-based multichannel chemosensor, DTPH [1,5-bis-(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)carbonohydrazide],
was examined to be highly proficient to recognize CN– based on the H-bonding interaction between sensor −NH moiety
and CN– in aqueous medium with explicit selectivity.
In the absorption spectral titration of DTPH, a new peak
at higher wavelength was emerged in titrimetric analytical studies
of CN– with the zero-order reaction kinetics affirming
the substantial sensor–analyte interaction. The isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) experiment further affirmed that the sensing
process was highly spontaneous with the Gibbs free energy of −26
× 104 cal/mol. The binding approach between DTPH and CN– was also validated by more
than a few experimental studies by means of several spectroscopic
tools along with the theoretical calculations. A very low detection
limit of the chemosensor toward CN– (0.15 ppm) further
instigated to design an RGB-based sensory device based on the colorimetric
upshots of the chemosensor in order to develop a distinct perception
regarding the presence of innocuous or precarious level of the CN– in a contaminated solution. Moreover, the reversibility
of the sensor in the presence of CN– and Hg2+ originated a logic gate mimic ensemble. Additionally, the
real-field along with the in vitro CN– detection
efficiency of the photostable DTPH was also accomplished
by using various biological specimens.

Introduction
The recognition of
toxic anionic elements is an arena of colossal
cognizance in the 21st century.1−7 From the environmental perspective, cyanide (CN–) is one of the most precarious anionic analytes which causes noxious
effects on bio-organisms, specifically on mammals.2,3 It
prevents to activate cytochrome C oxidase (COX) by binding with Fe
in the protein, which results in the interdiction of cellular inhalation
and cellular anoxia or hypoxia.1−3,8−10 Likewise, cyanide also upsurges the reactive oxygen
species level and consequently the electron transportation sequence
in mitochondria is blocked causing the inhibition in the synthesis
of adenosine triphosphate. This toxic element as well causes hasty
assassination and adversely invades the cardiovascular as well as
the central nervous system.2 In this way,
CN– results in vomiting, convulsion, unconsciousness,
and ultimately death.1 Even a trace amount
of CN– (0.5–3.5 mg kg–1 body weight) is sufficient to kill a human being.6,11 Inside
the blood of a person affected by fire, the CN– concentration
should lie within 23–26 mM.12 According
to WHO and USEPA the safe limit and maximum contaminant level (MCL)
of cyanide is set to be 0.07 and 0.2 ppm, respectively.1,8,13

Despite its dreadful toxicity,
New Zealand and Australian Environmental
and Conservation Council reported that approximately 2–4 g/L
CN– is essential for 99% of the habitants in the
marine and freshwater.1 Some foods and
plants like fruits, apple seeds, bitter almonds, and cassava roots
also contain CN–.1,2,13 In contrast, cyanide has several significant roles
in numerous industrial practices, such as gold mining; petrochemical
production; metallurgy; metal electroplating and case-hardening; steel,
resins, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals as well as fiber manufacturing
and photography.1−3,5,6,9,10,12 Undeniably, around 1 million ton of CN–-enriched products are manufactured per year for commercial
purpose.2 In addition, CN– is also used as terror substances and chemical warfare reagents.14 Therefore, the third world is at high risk,
due to the rapid increase in the CN– concentration
in the drinking water on account of inundating. In this perspective,
detection of CN– has unremittingly obtained noteworthy
consideration owing to its disastrous consequences on breathing organisms
as well as on the environment.2,5−8

In this background, exploration of neoteric cyanide-selective
sensors
capable to recognize trace level of CN– in water,
soil, food, air, and in biological samples is of today’s interest.5,8,9,15 Chromatography,
spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, flow injection
amperometry, and potentiometry are some of the available technologies
presently used for the detection of CN– in several
processed samples which are time-consuming and convoluted to be handled
by untutored personnel.2,5,8,9,16,17 In this perspective, premeditated synthesis of more
effectual and sensitive technique to recognize CN– unswervingly at lower level in different mediums is cynosure to
the researchers.1 A number of artificial
chemoreceptors containing Lewis acids, metalloreceptors, protonated
polyammonium macrocycles, guanidiniums, pyrroles, amides, and organogels
are explored for their recognition competence toward various anions.2,18−20 Most of the explored receptors bear very intricate
structures which usually entail manifold synthetic procedures with
comparatively lower yields.4 Nevertheless
the organic chemosensors are not really proficient in water medium
due to high hydration energy of the anions (ΔGhyd for CN– is −320 kJ mol–1) and effective rivalry of the H2O molecules
for the binding sites. In this background, exploration of potent multichannel
chemosensors, capable of functioning in the presence of water is of
certain interest.21−24 The chemodosimetric approach, which employs the coordination interaction
of CN– to (i) a transition metal, (ii) an electronically
deficient carbonyl moiety, or (iii) a coordinative unsaturated borane
complexes are proficient methods with the intention of detecting cyanide
in water. Still the chemodosimetric method has several disadvantages,
such as delayed time, irreversibility, and requirement of high temperature
to be activated for binding the cyanide ion to the suitable interactive
part of the sensors. Even though innumerable compounds capable to
provide H-bond forming units have been developed, which display strong
attraction and selectivity toward CN– in organic
solvent, small molecular probes capable to proficiently sense CN– through H-bonding interaction in aqueous phase are
very scarce to date. Moreover most of the H-bonding receptors suffer
from higher limit of detection and less selectivity.3 In these consequences, inventing well-organized proficient
chemosensors for low level detection of CN– in the
presence of water is still a challenging task to the researchers.3 Colorimetric chemosensors are considered to be
more advantageous on account of their affordability, simplicity, sensitivity,
selectivity, and instantaneous detection capability.11 The foremost mechanism which can elicit an obvious color
change of a sensor molecule by the interaction with an anionic species
is the charge–transfer transitions, which triggers the alteration
of the spectroscopic characters of the sensor and consequently changes
its UV–vis spectrum.21 Moreover,
the lesser hydration energy (ΔHhyd = −67 kJ mol–1) of CN– than that of F– (ΔHhyd = −505 kJ mol–1), AcO– (ΔHhyd = −375 kJ mol–1), and H2PO4– (ΔHhyd = −260 kJ mol–1) further helps to selectively recognize CN– in the pool of others competitive anions.11,12,25−27

In this context,
here we have introduced a unique urea-based chemosensor DTPH [1,5-bis(2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)carbonohydrazide],
capable to detect CN– selectively at very low level
in 9:1 ACN–water media (Scheme 1). To the extent of our awareness, urea-based chemosensors,
capable to recognize CN– selectively is scanty in
the literature so far. The multichannel chemosensor proficiently recognized
CN– colorimetrically, fluorimetrically, and electrochemically
due to the presence of four dissociable H containing −NH moieties
in its skeleton. In addition, the premeditated presence of the electron-withdrawing
−Cl and −CF3 groups at the ortho and para
positions, respectively, regulated the binding affinity of the −NH
moieties. The production of DTPH and the entire sensing
phenomena were established by using quite a few sophisticated analytical
instruments, for instance, ESI-MS, FT-IR, UV–vis, PL, CV, 1H NMR, and so on.28 All of the
experimental outcomes apprised that the intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT), and the restricted photoinduced electron transfer (PET) prompted
the sensing process. Moreover, the rate constant of the sensing process
were also calculated to get a clear indication regarding the requisite
time of recognition. The thermodynamic characteristics of the sensing
process were also noted by using isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC). 1H NMR studies in consort with the theoretical calculations
provided rational evidence on the subject of the plausible interaction
mode between the chemosensor and CN–. Moreover,
the sensor···CN– adduct showed high
selectivity toward Hg2+, one among the most perilous and
widely distributed metal ions in soil, water and air.29−33 In addition, DTPH is successfully recognized CN– in bitter almond seeds and fetal bovine serum (FBS),
emboldening the usage of the chemosensor in our everyday-lives.34 Furthermore, the chemosensor was also perceived
to be capable to detect CN– in the HeLa cells and
human lungs carcinoma cells.35,36 Apart from these, an
easy, instant, on-field, RGB-based sensory device has also been fabricated
so as to recognize CN– in both of its acceptable
as well as excruciating concentration.37−41 Several color sensors are used in recent time so
as to measure pH, color in the cosmetics, foods, beverages, printing,
and so forth, where the light is divided into three primary colors:
red (R), green (G), and blue (B). However, the explored colorimetric
sensory devices are mainly comprised of a TCS color sensor and a developer
board, which is relatively expensive.42 Therefore, in this work, some of the conventional techniques were
modified in order to minimize the cost of the entire prototype and
to make the device naive and user friendly. In this customized sensory
device, various important segments, like TCS, microcontrollers, LED
and so forth, were assimilated on a printed circuitry board and the
performance of the developed integrated circuit board was optimized
by using a reference ARDUINO.

Scheme 1 Structure of DTPH
Results and Discussion
Single-Crystal X-ray Analysis
of DTPH
The crystal of DTPH was obtained by
careful evaporation of 1:1 DCM–hexane
solvent mixture (Figure 1) (CCDC no. 1944265). DTPH was observed to be an asymmetrical
molecule, where the [(−NH–NH)2–C=O]
group fashioned a connection amongst two chloro-fluoromethyl phenyl
rings which were eventually nonplanar to each other. The C=O
bond length was shown to be 1.22 Å and the N–H bond lengths
were perceived to be 0.86 Å, whereas the C–N and N–N
bond lengths were 1.34 and 1.37 Å, respectively, on both the
contiguous sides. These findings affirmed that both the C–N
and N–N bond distances were lesser than that of the urea and
unsubstituted hydrazine moieties. Moreover, the C–Cl bond distances
(1.73 Å) along with the C–F bond lengths (lied between
1.20 and 1.37 Å) were also found to be closed to the conventional
C–Cl (1.77 Å) and C–F (1.35 Å) bond lengths,
which put forward the existence of conjugation throughout the sensor
molecule. There was an intramolecular interaction within the −Cl
group of the phenyl part and the N center adjacent to the −CO
group having the bond distance 2.93 Å. Two intermolecular interactions
were also found to be transpired. One is the interaction amongst the
O center of −CO of one molecule and the amide N of the adjacent
molecule (bond distance: 2.81 Å), whereas another interaction
was found to be emerged within the −Cl group of the phenyl
moiety and the phenyl C center of the adjacent molecule (bond distance:
3.41 Å). However an intermolecular H bonding within the carbonyl
O center and the amide H center was also found with the bond length
of 2.02 Å. The existing intramolecular and intermolecular interactions
finally formed an extended supramolecular 2D chain (Figure 1, Tables S1–S4; Supporting Information).43 Furthermore, the N–C(=O)–N and C–N–N
bond angles were observed to be 114 and 125°, respectively, which
affirmed the presence of strain within the sensor molecule.44,45

Naked-Eye Observation
In order to perform the visual
colorimetric recognition experiment of DTPH, 10–4 M sensor solution was prepared in ACN and 10–5 M anion solutions were prepared in 9:1 ACN–H2O
medium. The anionic solutions were thereafter added separately to
the sensor solutions by maintaining 1:1 ratio and interestingly the
color of the sensor solutions turned into orange red from colorless
upon addition of CN–, whereas the sensor remained
intact in presence of the others anion (Figures S4 and S5; Supporting Information).

Absorption Spectral Studies
of DTPH with TBA+CN–
High photostability of a chemosensor
is a good indication to be a competent contender in the arena of several
chemical and biological experiments.46,47 In this perspective,
time-dependent absorption studies were performed so as to assess the
photostability of the colorimetric chemosensor. Amusingly DTPH was found to be almost unchanged upon keeping under UV lamp (255
nm) for 40 min (Figure 2b), which signified that DTPH was highly photostable
and is advantageous for long-time experiments. Additionally, DTPH was also perceived to have no significant alteration
in its absorbance spectra within a broad pH range of 5–12 (Figure
S15, Supporting Information).

spectra of DTPH (10–5 M) in
the presence of TBACN (10–4 M) in 9:1 ACN–H2O medium; (b) photostability of DTPH upon exposure to UV-lamp
(255 nm) for 40 min. (c) Kinetic study of DTPH–CN– interaction.

The UV–vis titration studies
of DTPH were performed
with 10–5 M sensor solution prepared in ACN and
10–4 M CN– solution prepared in
9:1 ACN–H2O medium. Here, the occurrence of water
probably inhibited the deprotonation upon addition of CN–.25,26 From the absorption spectra, it was shown
that the free sensor exhibited two peaks at 255 and 300 nm corresponding
to the π–π* and n−π* transition, respectively,
and the π–π* transition also corroborated with
the time-dependent density functional theory calculation (Figure S13; Supporting Information).5 Upon steady addition of CN– to the sensor, a new
peak was noticed to be emerged at 480 nm with simultaneous diminution
of the initial peak and upsurge of the peak at 300 nm, affirming an
charge-transfer transition within the −NH moiety of the sensor
and CN– (Figure 2a). Here, the H-bonding interaction between the sensor
and CN– triggered the increased electron density
around the sensor which further reduced the energy gap between the
molecular orbitals and therefore the absorbance wavelength increased
causing the concomitant color change.25

To acquire a clear acuity regarding the time required for
the host–guest
interaction, kinetic studies of the DTPH with CN– were performed by taking same amount of 10–4 M ligand and analyte solution.48−50 From the kinetic data
plots, it was found that the ligand to analyte interaction was of
zero order with the rate constant 4.28 × 10–4 s (Figure 2c). This
finding suggested a fast reaction between DTPH and CN–. In addition, enhancement of the absorbance intensity
at 480 nm with the exacerbated CN– concentration
can be efficiently used in order to quantify the concentration of
CN–.5 The detection limit
of the sensor for CN– was calculated and found to
be 0.15 ppm which was far beyond its acceptable MCL value (Figure
S7; Supporting Information).7 Additionally, the Job’s plot further affirmed
the 1:2 interaction between DTPH and CN– (Figure S19, Supporting Information).

Fabrication of Colorimetric Sensory Device
Instigated
by the very low level detection adeptness of DTPH toward
CN–, a colorimetric circuitry with preferred indoctrination
was proposed in order to get a lucid perspicacity regarding the concentration
of CN– in a solution by means of a naive addition-observation
method (Figure 3).50 The chemosensor produced distinctive colorimetric
responses in the presence of different concentration of CN–. DTPH turned from colorless to yellowish orange when
the CN– level was less than the MCL value (<0.2
ppm), whereas it became orange red when the CN– concentration
exceeds the safe limit (>0.2 ppm). Based on these observations,
the
fabricated archetype, aligned with a TCS mounted on a designed circuitry
board embedded with a microcontroller and display unit, can be a significant
outline for monitoring the CN– concentration in
solution. The entire electronic setup was placed in an acrylic make
black box to inhibit the influence of the surroundings light sources
to the color sensor. In this device, the concomitant colorimetric
responses of DTPH in the presence of different concentration
of CN–, was transpired by the proposed suitable
integrated circuit, and the final output was observed in the display
unit, where the green signal turned on when the CN– concentration was lower than 0.2 ppm, whereas in the presence of
higher concentration of CN–, the red signal started
to glow.

Figure 3 RGB-based sensory device for easy, instantaneous, and on field
detection of CN–.

Two characteristic absorbance spectra at 255 and 300 nm were observed
for DTPH, whereas there was no peak at 450–480
nm. However, the addition of CN– to the chemosensor
solution resulted in a prominent color change along with the concomitant
response in the absorbance spectra of DTPH. Excitingly, DTPH was found to have sharp concentration-specific colorimetric
responses in reply to CN– which justified the appearance
of a new peak at 450 nm upon addition of <0.2 ppm CN–, while upon addition of higher amount of CN–,
the peak was shifted to 480 nm with significant diminution of the
characteristic peak at 255 nm (Figure 4a). These findings indicated the significant color
transition of the resulting chemosensor solution upon addition of
different concentration of CN– in consort with the
prominent changes in the RGB values. Moreover, these interesting properties
of DTPH incited to fabricate an easy, instant, on field,
RGB-based sensory device with the intention of monitoring the safer
and precarious level of CN– in various specimens.
The changes in the RGB values correlating with the color changes of
different concentration of CN–-containing DTPH solutions were observed by taking the inherent RGB values
of the chemosensor solution as the reference. The mounted RGB color
sensor attached with the fabricated device detected the specific R,
G, and B values of the input samples and processed through a coded
microcontroller which was finally displayed on the digital display
unit as high or low concentration of CN–.

Figure 4 (a) Absorption
spectral response of DTPH in presence
of different concentration of CN– solution; (b)
change of ΔC values with time; change in ΔR, ΔG, and ΔB values with time (c) for the low concentration and (d) high concentration
of CN– containing solution.

Herein, for the experimentation of low level CN– detection, 0.18 ppm CN– solution was added to
the DTPH solution (10–3 M in ACN) by
maintaining 1:1 stoichiometry ratio followed by the exposure to the
RGB color sensor and the resultant R, G, and B values were found to
be prominently increased from the reference RGB values instantaneously.
The nearly constant ΔR, ΔG, and ΔB values signified a stable response
of DTPH toward CN–. For low concentration
of CN–, the resulting sample attained a yellowish
orange color due to the formation of new DTPH–CN– adduct along with the appearance of a broad spectra
at 450 nm affirming the formation of the adduct. Consequently, ΔR and ΔG values increased with time
very slightly, whereas the ΔB remained unchanged
throughout the experimentation (Figure 4c). Similarly, for higher concentration of CN–, prominent changes were observed in RGB values as well as in the
absorption spectra of the chemosensor. The changes in the color range
noticed by human eyes are not exactly similar to the absorption spectral
responses.51 The broad range in spectra
covering the blue, greenish blue, blue green, and green color which
is detected by an instrument is observed as their harmonized colors
(yellow, orange, red orange, and red, respectively) by the human eyes.51 Therefore, with the increasing CN– concentration, the color range red shifted from the blue region
absorption spectra and thus an increase in the green and red filter
photodiode signal, as well as decrease in the blue filter photodiode
was observed from the lower concentration of CN– containing solution. As a result, the R and G values were perceived
to be increased essentially. Again the ΔR and
ΔG values increased with time, whereas compared
to lower concentration of CN– solution, the ΔG values were continuously increased up to the saturation
point in a spontaneous manner (Figure 4d).

Furthermore, to affirm the noticeable changes,
the RGB values were
expressed with reference to the total change in color (ΔC) by the Euclidean distance equation  where ΔR, ΔG, and ΔB are the
changes in R, G,
and B values from the reference values, correspondingly. (Figure 4c) The ΔC value remained unchanged up to 15 min for the low concentration
of CN– solution, whereas, for higher concentration
of CN–, the ΔC value became
nearly constant after a certain times affirming the quick and firm
response of DTPH toward CN–.42,52 Therefore, all of these findings implied that the RGB sensor signals
adequately correlated with the optical as well as the absorption spectral
upshots of different concentration of DTPH–CN– adduct.

Overture toward the Electronic Circuit Fabrication
The rescindable outcome of DTPH and CN– in the presence of Hg2+ can imitate numerous logical
functions, which can be useful to accomplish several molecular level
mathematical calculations.31,53−56 The creation of molecular level logical operation is principally
originated from some spectroscopic responses of the given chemical
inputs so that an intricate circuit can be efficient to unravel several
computational complexities.57 At the present
time, alterable switches are of significant importance owing to their
substantial requirement in the information technology.

Introducing
anionic as well as cationic inputs can produce a discrete spectral
change, which instigated us to utilize DTPH, CN–, and Hg2+ to constitute a three-input coalescent circuitry
(Figure S8; Supporting Information). In
this case, upon addition of Hg2+, the orange red colored
solution of DTPH–CN– adduct
turned into the colorless solution of DTPH by releasing
CN– from the host–guest assembly, whereas
upon further addition of CN– the orange red coloration
of the solution returned and this cyclic colorimetric turn-off-on
occurrences of the DTPH–CN– solution
by the addition of Hg2+ was continued significantly up
to seven times. The spectroscopic outcomes of DTPH with
entering analytes like CN– and Hg2+ are
tabulated in Table S5 (Supporting Information). The sensor itself possessed absorbance spectra at 255 nm (OUTY1),
while in the presence of CN– the sensor resulted
in the absorbance spectra at 480 nm (OUTY2). Upon addition of Hg2+, the spectroscopic response at 255 nm was regenerated with
consequent diminution of the peak at 480 nm, whereas various others
competitive metal ions (Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Pb2+) were irresponsive toward the DTPH–CN– solution (Figures S16 and
S17, Supporting Information). Therefore,
OUTY2 was in the ON stage if both the input 1 (DTPH)
and input 2 (CN–) were present. Conversely, in the
presence of an inhibitor input 3 (Hg2+), the output signal
at OUTY2 was OFF and OUTY1 was ON, which further reproduced the free
sensor. Succinctly, OUTY2 was in the ON state when both the In 1 and
In 2 were present and the addition of In 3 caused the OUTY2 to be
turned off (OUT = 0) and OUTY1 to be turned on, forming a NOT gate.
As shown in the Table S5, methodical observation
of the absorbance spectral response at 255 and 480 nm by the chronological
addition of CN– (In 2) and Hg2+ (In 3)
to the sensor produced an INHIBIT logic function. Moreover, the chemosensor
possessing this type of anion–cation dual responses up to seven
cycles can be an optimistic prospect toward the exploration of a prospective
molecular logic gate mimic device (Figures 5 and S9; Supporting Information).

logic functions for DTPH with CN– and
Hg2+.

Emission Spectral Studies
of DTPH with TBA+CN–
The luminescence experiments
of DTPH with CN– were performed with
the same solutions of sensor and CN– as taken for
the absorbance studies. The nonfluorescent chemosensor exhibited an
infirm emission spectrum at 355 nm by the excitation at 290 nm, which
concomitantly up surged upon consecutive addition of CN– along with the simultaneous red shifting of the peak position (Figure
S10; Supporting Information). The bathochromic
spectral shift of the sensor in presence of CN– clearly
suggested the favorable ICT process.58−62 Additionally, the turn-on fluorescence response in
presence of CN– may be the consequence of the constraint
in the PET as a result of the sensor–CN– interaction.63−66

Electrochemical Studies of DTPH with TBA+CN–
Cyclic voltammetric titration of DTPH upon continuous addition of CN– was
performed by using 10–3 M DTPH solution
prepared in ACN and 10–4 M CN– solution made in 9:1 ACN–H2O solvent.67,68 Three-electrode electrochemical cell was used to carry out the experiment,
and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was
used as the supporting electrolyte. The free sensor showed an oxidation
peak at 0.405 V (current height −1.72 × 10–6 A). After interaction with CN–, the initial peak
started to decrease in current height and after addition of 0.118
mM CN– the peak was found to be shifted to 0.415
V (current height −3.1 × 10–6 A) (Figure
S11; Supporting Information) connoting
the restraint in PET within the sensor molecule.

1H NMR Titration of DTPH with TBA+CN–
The 1H NMR titration
studies of DTPH in the presence of CN– were performed in DMSO-d6 solvent to
acquire an explicit conjecture regarding the plausible binding mode
of CN– with the sensor (Figure 6).69,70 In the 1H NMR spectra, it was observed that the sensor owns two −NH
proton signals at 8.56 and 7.51 ppm, corresponding to the −NHa and −NHb protons, respectively, and the
lingering aromatic protons were observed to be emerged at 7.7 ppm.
Upon gradual addition of CN–, the −NH protons
were started to diminish in intensity with simultaneous broadening,
signifying a strong H-bonding interaction between CN– and the −NH moiety of DTPH.71 Moreover, the spectra further showed that the peak corresponding
to more dissociable −NHa proton was completely diminished
by only 0.06 mM addition of CN– while the −NHb proton disappeared by 0.08 mM CN– addition.
These findings further affirmed that CN– interacted
more strongly with the more polarizable −NHa proton
followed by the −NHb protons (Scheme 2).

presence of TBACN in DMSO-d6.

Scheme 2 Plausible Binding Mode of DTPH and CN–
Infrared Spectroscopic
Studies of DTPH with TBA+CN–
The detection of CN– by DTPH was further ascertained with the help of infrared
spectroscopic studies (Figure S6; Supporting Information). The IR experiment was executed by adding 1 equivalent TBACN with
the sensor. The free sensor displayed two characteristic peaks at
3410 and 1670 cm–1, confirming the presence of −NH
and −CO groups in the framework. After addition of CN–, a new peak was engendered at 2100 cm–1, indicating
a significant interaction of DTPH with CN–.72 The disappearance of the −NH
peak asserted the interaction of CN– with the −NH
moiety of the chemosensor. Moreover, the peak corresponding to −CO
group along with the others peak were found to be broadened attributing
to the increase in the charge density within the system.

Isothermal
Titration Calorimetric Studies of DTPH with TBA+CN–
In order to get
clear insights regarding the thermodynamic parameters subsumed in
the interaction between DTPH and CN–, ITC experiment has been effectuated at 25 °C which directly
determines the alteration in enthalpy (ΔH),
binding constant (K) , and stoichiometry (n).73 The calorimetric titration
plot is depicted in Figure 7, from where the enthalpy (ΔH) and
entropy changes (ΔS) were observed to be 1.865
× 104 cal/mol and 95.5 cal/mol/deg, respectively.
The association constant was found to be 1.60 × 107 M–1. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) was further calculated by the equation: ΔG = ΔH – TΔS, and it was reckoned to be −26 × 104 cal/mol, which affirmed that the interaction between DTPH and CN– was highly feasible and spontaneous.74−79

plot of DTPH in presence of TBACN.

Theoretical Findings
The theoretical studies were accomplished
by using Turbomole (v7.0) in order to affirm the sensing mechanism
of CN– by DTPH and the DFT calculations
exclusively agreed with the experimental finding.80,81 In free DTPH, the −NH bond distances were observed
to be 1.015 Å for −NHa and 1.019 Å for
−NHb, which were found to be lengthened and the
HOMO–LUMO gap along with the energy of the free DTPH was also lowered down in the presence of CN–,
affirming the H-bonding host–guest interaction and the consequent
appearance of the UV–vis spectra at a longer wavelength (Figure
S12, Table S6; Supporting Information).8 The 1H NMR spectra revealed that CN– interacted with the sensor through H-bonding interaction
with both of the −NHa and −NHb hydrogens, which was also established in the DFT calculations. In
case of the 1:1 host–guest interaction between the −NHa hydrogen of DTPH and CN–,
the distances of CN– with both of the −NHa hydrogen were found to be 2.02 Å, and the −NHa bond lengths were extended to 1.03 Å from 1.015 Å.
Likewise, when CN– interacted with the −NHb hydrogen, the distances between the H and CN– were perceived to be 1.91 Å while the −NHb bond distances were elongated to 1.038 Å from 1.019 Å
(Figure 8, Tables S7–S9; Supporting Information).

of 1:1 interactions between DTPH and CN–.

On the other hand, in the case
of 1:2 DTPH–CN– interaction,
when CN– interacted
with both of the −NHa hydrogen of N4 and N19 along
with the −NHb hydrogen of N7, the distances between
CN– and hydrogen were measured to be 2.16 Å
(for N4 hydrogen), 1.97 Å (for N19 hydrogen), and 1.93 Å
(for N7 hydrogen). Moreover, the −NH bond lengths of N4, N19,
and N7 were lengthened to 1.022, 1.032, and 1.038 Å, respectively.
On the other hand, when CN– attached with the −NHb hydrogen of N21 along with the −NHa hydrogens
of N4 and N19, the distance between CN– and −NH
were observed to be 1.92 Å (for N21 hydrogen), 1.93 Å (for
N4 hydrogen), and 2.16 Å (for N19 hydrogen). Simultaneously the
−NH bond distances of the N4, N19, and N21 were also stretched
from their initial distances to 1.038, 1.022, and 1.031 Å correspondingly.
On the other hand, when −CN– interacted with
both of the −NHb hydrogen, the distances between
CN– and hydrogens were shown to be 1.93 Å for
each and the −NH bond lengths were extended to 1.04 Å
for N21 and 1.38 Å for N7 (Figure 9, Tables S10–S12; Supporting Information).

DTPH
and CN–.

In addition, the 1:3 DTPH–CN– interaction was also likely to take place. In this case, CN– interacted with all of the −NHa and
−NHb hydrogen, and the bond distance between CN– and −NH hydrogen were found to be 2.18 Å
for N19, 2.03 Å for N4, 1.92 Å for N21, and 2.05 Å
for N7. The −NH bond lengths were also extended to 1.022 Å
for N19, 1.026 Å for N4, 1.038 Å for N21, and 1.03 Å
for N7 (Figure 10,
Table S13; Supporting Information). The
upshots of the DFT calculations are summarized in Table 1.

Real-Time Applications of DTPH To Recognize
CN–
With the purpose of exploring the real-time
usability of
the chemosensor in our day-to-day lives, 1.5 g of crushed bitter almond
seeds were mixed with 5 mL of distilled water, and the solution was
kept under stirring for around 1 h77,82,83 The mixture was then kept to be stabilized. After
that the solution was tested with 1 mM DTPH solution.
Amusingly, the color of the sensor solution changed from colorless
to orange red upon the addition of the filtered bitter almond solution.
Moreover, in the UV–vis spectra of the DTPH–bitter
almond solution, a peak at 480 nm was observed, confirming the sensing
ability of the sensor toward CN– present in the
bitter almond seeds (Figure 11a).

Figure 11 Detection of CN– in (a) bitter almond
seed and
(b) FBS by DTPH.

Apart from the bitter almond seed, the chemosensor was also found
to be proficient to recognize CN– in the FBS tainted
with CN–.8 At first,
0.5 mM CN– was spiked with the fresh FBS procured
from HiMedia and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Thereafter, the
supernatant was examined with 1 mM DTPH solution and
amusingly the color of the solution turned from colorless to orange
red. The CN–-spiked FBS-containing DTPH solution was also examined in the UV–vis spectra, and the
peak at around 480 nm suggested that the colorimetric change was undeniably
as a result of the existence of CN– in the serum
(Figure 11b).

Live
Cell Imaging Studies of DTPH To Recognize
CN–
The intracellular CN– detection efficiency of the probe, DTPH was also investigated
by using HeLa cells as well as human lung carcinoma cell lines (A549).32,84 The fluorescence microscopy images were completely in good agreement
with the fluorescence spectral characteristic of the DTPH–CN– adduct (Figures 12 and S14, Supporting Information). From the confocal microscopy images, it was perceived
that the initially nonluminescent chemosensor turned into cyan emissive
by the addition of CN–, which was completely consistent
with the fluorescence titration experiment of the chemosensor in the
presence of CN–, asserting that the chemosensor
possesses a noteworthy efficiency to recognize CN– in the cell mediums also. Moreover, the MTT assay further revealed
that 80% cells were viable when the concentration of the chemosensor
was 100 μM.85−90

(b) human lung carcinoma cells incubated with DTPH and

Concise Comparative Studies
with Some Hitherto Explored Effective
Sensors
A number of inimitable sensing properties and applicability
of DTPH compared to several newly explored CN– sensors have been elucidated in Table S14 (Supporting Information).34,36 From the table, it can be clearly
shown that some of the explored chemosensors are comparable with DTPH in terms of detection limit and binding affinity, but
the RGB-based colorimetric sensory device is not reconnoitered in
the others work. Additionally, most of the explored chemosensors are
revealed to be dual channel chemosensors, capable to detect CN– by colorimetrically and/or fluorimetrically, while DTPH, being a multichannel chemosensor, can recognize CN– colorimetrically, fluorimetrically as well as electrochemically.

Conclusions
In compendium, a hydrazine-functionalized colorimetric,
fluorimetric,
and electrochemical chemosensor DTPH was prepared by
using some inexpensive reagents, and the chemosensor showed high sensitivity
toward the prejudicial CN– anion in aqueous medium.
More than a few experimental as well as the theoretical outcomes affirmed
that the photostable chemosensor can recognize CN– owing to the H-bonding interaction between the sensor −NH
moiety and −CN– anion. Enthused by this very
low detection limit (0.15 ppm), a portable RGB-based colorimetric
sensory device has also been developed, which was proficient to coherently
differentiate the safe and unsafe levels of CN– in
a solution. Moreover, the spontaneity of the sensing phenomenon was
further asserted by the ITC experiment. The sensing ability of the DTPH···CN– adducts toward
the noxious Hg2+ among several others competitive metal
ions further impelled to formulate a logic gate mimic ensemble. In
addition, DTPH also revealed high efficiency to detect
CN– in the bitter almond seed, which made it a proficient
CN– selective chemosensor in the field of real-world
application. Moreover, the efficacious CN– sensing
ability of DTPH in FBS made it feasible to detect CN– in real biotic samples. Additionally, the excellent
intracellular CN– detection efficiency of DTPH made it a noteworthy contender in the realm of bio-sensing
applications.

Experimental Section
Materials and Method
All of the preparatory materials
(chemicals and solvents) were commercially obtainable and procured
from Sigma-Aldrich. The analytical grade reagents were used devoid
of any further refinement. All TBA salts of anions and the metal ion
salts were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used deprived of
any decontamination.

Apparatus
The ESI-MS was recorded
in Advion’s
CMS Expression (having serial number: 3013-0140) compact mass spectrometer.
The IR spectra were effectuated in PerkinElmer FT-IR Spectrum 100
spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were carried out in Bruker
400 MHz spectrometer. The SCXRD analysis was performed by using Bruker
D8 Venture along with a photon detector. CARY60 and PerkinElmer LS-45
spectrophotometer were used to perform the adsorption and fluorescence
experiments. Photostability and kinetic studies were accomplished
in UV–Vis Cary-100 System having serial number EL08063728.
Cyclic voltammetry studies were executed in the CH instrument. The
ITC experiment was performed in Malvern Instruments (model VP-ITC).
The fluorescence microscopy images were captured by using Nikon make
confocal laser scanning microscopy (Model: Al(R)).

Synthesis of DTPH and Characterization
The synthesis of DTPH was carried out entirely in the
inert atmosphere. At first, 2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl
hydrazine (2 mM) was dissolved in 50 mL dry dichloromethane (DCM).
After complete dissolution, 2 mM triphosgene was added to the solution
along with the subsequent addition of a saturated NaHCO3 solution. The mixture was then kept under stirring and after constant
shaking for around 12 h the white colored product was obtained by
using a separating funnel, and it was then washed by using distilled
water (Scheme S1; Supporting Information). Finally the solid compound was washed and purified by hexane.
Single crystals are obtained by evaporating DCM and hexane mixture
after 3 days. The constitution of the compound was confirmed by ESI-MS,
IR, 1H NMR, and single-crystal X-ray studies (Figures S1–S3; Supporting Information). Yield: 390 mg, 76%;
mp 209 °C; (m/z) calcd, 513.94
for C15H8Cl4F6N4O; found, 514.5 [DTPH + H+]: 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, Me4Si): δ 8.56 (s, 2H), 7.7(d, 4Ar-H), 7.747 (s, 2H). The DTPH–CN– adduct was also confirmed from mass spectroscopy (Figure
S18, Supporting Information).
