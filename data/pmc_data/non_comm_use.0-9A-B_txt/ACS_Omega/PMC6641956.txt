There is a growing
interest in a more wholesome utilization of
biomass as the need for greener chemistry and non-mineral oil-based
products increases. Lignin is the largest renewable resource for aromatic
chemicals, which is found in all types of lignocellulosic biomass.
Steam-explosion of lignocellulosic biomass is a useful pretreatment
technique to make the polymeric material more available for processing.
However, this heat-based pretreatment is known to result in the formation
of pseudo-lignin, a lignin-like polymer made from carbohydrate degradation
products. In this work, we have analyzed steam-exploded birch with
a varying severity factor (3.1–5.0) by pyrolysis–gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry, 2D-NMR, and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy. The main results reveal a consumption of acetic
acid at higher temperatures, with the increase of furan components
in the pyrolyzate. The IR and NMR spectral data support these results,
and there is a reason to believe that the conditions for humin formation
are accomplished under steam explosion. Pseudo-lignin seems to be
a humin-like compound.

Introduction
Total utilization of
lignocellulosic biomass and conversion into
a range of valuable products is a central goal in biorefining and
green chemistry. This renewable material has the potential to replace
depleting fossil resources for the production of energy, chemicals,
and fuels.1−3 Lignin is the most abundant renewable aromatic polymer
on the planet and is found in all types of lignocellulosic biomass.
However, in the pulp and paper industry and the emerging cellulosic
ethanol industry, lignin is considered to be a waste product and is
currently mostly burned to generate process heat.4−8 For biochemical production of ethanol, a pretreatment
of the lignocellulosic biomass is needed to make the carbohydrates
accessible for enzymes. Steam explosion (SE) is a treatment with a
high industrial potential, as it has a low cost for energy and does
not need addition of other chemicals than steam, thereby producing
no extra waste.9−11 SE is both a chemical and physical treatment. It
hydrolyses the hemicellulose into soluble monomers and oligomers and
makes the cellulose fibers much more accessible for further degradation
with enzymes.12−14 The lignin and cellulose part is not expected to
be significantly altered during SE, but as several other authors have
noticed, the β-O-4 bonds in lignin are degraded with increasing
pretreatment severity.15 For SE, the severity
factor can be calculated as log R0(16) that includes both temperature (T °C) and residence time (rt) as variables  

Interestingly, several studies show
an increase of Klason lignin
(KL) content after SE.17,18 This increase has been attributed
to the formation of pseudo-lignin during pretreatment.19 Recently, several studies have attempted to
identify the structure of pseudo-lignin, as it has been shown to hamper
the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.17−23 The general pseudo-lignin definition is broad and diffuse and the
most accepted one states that it is “an aromatic material that
yields a positive Klason lignin value that is not derived from native
lignin.”19 The KL analysis is however
only a crude method, as it just measures the increase of nonhydrolysable
residues after acid hydrolysis, and is therefore not a proper identification
test.18

SE treatment of hardwoods
releases acetic acid from the hemicellulose,
which leads to pH drop and drives the autohydrolysis.24,25 The acetic acid is generated from the acetylated carbohydrates,
mainly xylans, and it can accumulate to a pH of 3.26 Both time and temperature in SE have an effect on the release
of acetic acid. Li et al. showed that this relationship is almost
linear under hydrolysis with increasing time and temperature.27

With the combined effects of high temperature
and pressure in addition
to the low pH under SE, several side reactions can take place. The
cleavage of the β-O-4 bonding pattern in lignin has been reported
by Li et al.28 at pH 3, but the cleavage
also happens at a higher pH as reported by Yelle et al.29 A study of Glasser and Wright30 shows that the MW of lignin decreases during SE treatment
at severities above log R0 4.2.

The formation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from carbohydrates
are reported by several groups, as a degradation product of C6 sugars
such as glucose in cellulose, Scheme 1.22,25

Scheme 1 Overview of Reaction
Pathway of Cellulose and Hemicellulose into
Furan Components and Humin-Like Structures (Modified from Li et al.)25
Additionally, there is formation of furfural from C5 sugars
such
as xylose from xylan. Generally, C6 sugars are more stable than C5
sugars during high-temperature pretreatments. These furan-like components
can under certain conditions form a polymer structure called humin, Figure 1. Humins are an organic
compound class which are insoluble in water at all pH’s. The
term is used in two related contexts, soil and carbohydrate chemistry.
Humins from carbohydrates are produced under dehydration of sugars,
the subsequent formaldehydes, and 5-HMF form further polymers.31,32 van Zandvoort et al. found that the furan and phenol compounds formed
under acid-catalyzed dehydration of sugars are a part of the humin
structure formation.33 Patil et al. showed
the direct formation of humins from glucose, fructose, and 5-HMF as
a condensation product.34,35 In addition, Tuercke
et al. did a microreactor synthesis of 5-HMF from dehydrating fructose,
where it polymerized into a humin structure.36 A different group, Date et al. reduced 5-HMF with Pd/C and formaldehyde
and made a crystalline structure of 22.4 nm size.37

et al.).33

The byproduct called pseudo-lignin apparent in the increase
of
KL content is formed under SE-treatment with identical conditions
to what is needed for the formation of humins. The aim of this study
was to investigate this unknown byproduct with pyrolysis–gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), 2D-NMR, and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) for characterization
and identifications of similarities between pseudo-lignin and the
humins.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows that
the KL content (% KL) increased with the severity of the SE, from
22% in untreated birch to 40–42% at the most severe pretreatment
conditions. The estimated increase of KL as an effect of xylan loss
has been calculated to be 25%; this work has been described by Vivekanand
et al.18 In an effort to characterize this
pseudo-lignin the samples were analyzed by fractionated pyrolysis
and 2D-NMR.

2D-NMR Heteronuclear Single
Quantum Coherence (HSQC)
NMR experiments of the solvable
fraction of untreated and severely
pretreated (log R0 4.7) birch before pyrolysis
show the change in both aliphatic (Figure 2) and aromatic (Figure 3) regions. In the aliphatic area (Figure 2), from 2.6/45.0
to 5.3/115.0 ppm, the most noticeable difference is around the proton
peaks of the β-O-4 bonding pattern. The α-H shifts to
the left and the signal is lower for the SE sample than untreated
birch. The β-H signal has a similar pattern. In addition, the
γ-H and γ-H′ (ox) disappears nearly completely
after SE. Overall, this indicates that the β-O-4 bonding fragments
with the pretreatment. Interestingly, this happens even at the lowest
severity conditions in these pretreatment experiments, at 170 °C
10 min (Figure S1), even before the KL
amount increases. This means that the changes in the NMR spectrum
are not directly related to the accumulation of KL. Increasing the
SE severity factor only results in limited alterations in the NMR
spectra, while the KL content increases. Therefore, the byproduct
formed under SE is not dissolvable in any of the three deuterated
solvents used in this study.

and (B) severity
factor 4.7 (220 °C—15 min), focused on aliphatic region.

Figure 3 HSQC of lignocellulosic biomass at (A) untreated
and (B) severity
factor 4.7 (220 °C—15 min), focused on aromatic region.

The main change in the NMR spectra
is the emersion of xylan peaks.
These are visible in the spectrum (Figure 2) at 4.27/101, 3.88/3.17/63.0, 3.50/75.0,
3.25/74.0, and 3.0/72.5 ppm. The two peaks at 4.80/74.10 and 4.50/72.80
ppm is β-d-Xylp acetylated in position
C-3 and C-2, respectively.

The peaks at 4.85/93.0 and 4.90/93.0
ppm are actually the anomeric
carbon in d-xylose and d-glucose, respectively.
These peaks are detectable in even the lowest SE-treatment, but the
signal intensity is stronger at high severity factor such as 4.7 as
ppm. This means that carbohydrates are released, most likely from
fragmentation of lignin–carbohydrate complexes, cellulose,
and hemicellulose under SE as a result of depolymerization of lignocellulosic
biomass.

In the aromatic region (Figure 3), there is also an immediate change in the
NMR spectra
at lowest SE. The G2 and G6 shifts disappear
and only the G5 and S2,6 are left (Figure 3). With the increasing
SE-treatment, there is a new area that becomes stronger in the aromatic
region right below the S2,6 region. An additional change
in the aromatic region with the increasing SE-treatment is a shift
in the S2,6 peak. In the untreated version (Figure S2), there is an “iceberg”
shape and with increasing treatment the top peak shifts toward the
lower proton area. This small shift in S2,6 corresponds
to the difference in the enantiomer versions erythro and threo as
shown by Schmid and Bardet et al.38,39 This is in
compliance with hydrolysis in α-position in β-O-4, as
the signals shifts from racemic to thermodynamic stable enantiomer
signals.

In the SE-treated spectra in both regions (Figures 2 and 3), there are
peaks that correlates with the 5-HMF, at shift values, 4.5/56.5, 6.6/110.1,
and 7.5/125.0. The peaks have a low intensity, meaning that there
is a low concentration of 5-HMF dissolved in the sample.

Pyrolysis–GC–MS
The fractionated temperatures
in the pyrolysis was determined based on previous results, Aarum et
al. and Jurak,40,41 as the carbohydrates will be
mostly valorized at 350 °C and then subsequently pyrolysis at
600 °C would yield the lignin fraction. This turned out to be
a mostly correct assumption, as the 350 °C pyrogram contained
small amounts of lignin components. The amount of lignin at 350 °C
does increase with the SE-treatment, which is a result of the hydrolysis
of the β-O-4 bond in lignin at higher severities.

All
detected components after pyrolysis–GC–MS are described
in Table S1. At 350 °C, the pyrolyzate
is mainly composed of the most volatile products such as acetic acid
(1), small furan-like rings (2, 3, 9, and 12), and some lignin structures
(10, 15, 23, 24, and 25), see Figure 4.

Figure 4 Amount and structure of several components in the pyrolyzate
at
350 °C, as a function of severity factors of SE. The amounts
are the average of normalization with standard deviation of three
replicates. (A) Components of major amounts and (B) components of
minor amounts.

The pyrolyzate at 350
°C has an increase of lignin products
such as 15 (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, vanilin), 23 (4-[(E)-3-hydroxyprop-1-enyl]-2,6-dimethoxyphenol),
and 24 (3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)butan-2-one),
with the increasing severity of the SE-treatment, Figure 4. The increase of volatile
lignin components means that the polymer is more fragmented, which
corresponds to the hydrolysis and cleavage of the β-O-4 bond
as described in other works.28,30,42 In the pyrolyzate at 350 °C, there is a significant increase
of 5-HMF 12, first detected (1.5%) with a severity factor
of 3.9 at a temperature of 210 °C and a rt of 5 min. In untreated
wood samples, this compound was not detected at all. The amount of
5-HMF thereafter increased to approximately 25% at a severity factor
4.5, 4.8, and 5.0 (230 °C, all rts). HMF is a typical dehydration
product of C6 sugars.

The four main components that decrease
at 350 °C are 1 (acetic acid), 4 (unknown m/z 114), 5 (unknown m/z 114), and 10 (unknown m/z 152). Components 4 and 5 have the same molecular mass, but display distinctly different
fragmentation
patterns in their mass spectra and are therefore evidently not the
same compound.

The amount of acetic acid increases (45–59%)
until a severity
factor of 3.9 (210 °C, 5 min), from which point the amount decreases
(59–15%). The increase and subsequent loss of 1 has been previously reported by Sunqvist et al., where they observed
consumption of acetic acid by water extraction using a temperature
around 200 °C.26 Formation of 12 in the pyrolyzate coincides with the consumption of 1 at a severity factor of 3.9. This can explain that production
of 12 is a building block in the formation of humins
that also need acid, as shown in Figure 5 and Scheme 1.

biomass).

Using the pyrolysis temperature
(at 600 °C, shown in Figure 6), there is mainly
a decrease of 1. The other lignin components that increase
in amounts are 13 (2,6-dimethoxyphenol), 36 (2-methoxyphenol), 37 (2-methylphenol), 40 (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol), and 49 (2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol).
The three lignin components that are decreasing in amounts are 21 (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde), 22 (unknown m/z 196), and 25 (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde).

and structure of several components in the pyrolyzate at
600 °C, at different severity factors of SE. The amounts are
the average of a normalization with standard deviation of three replicates.
(A) Components of major amounts and (B) components of minor amounts.

In general, we have observed a
trend of decreasing amounts of aldehydes
and lignin’s with shorter side chains in the C-4 position with
the increasing severity factor. The β-O-4 bonding pattern can
undergo hydrolysis at both hydroxyl groups on the side chain C-4.
However, the α-hydroxyl gives the most stable intermediate cation.
This carbocation intermediate is subsequently open for nucleophilic
attack, rearrangement, or both, Scheme 2. The changes seen in the pyrolyzate composition is
mostly related to the α-carbon on the side chain, with a general
decrease in number of oxygen atoms.

Scheme 2 Reaction Pathways
under SE of Lignin that Might Take Place
The
first resonance structure
is open for a nucleophilic attack, Li et al.43 and Shimada et al.44 The fragmentation
reaction in the fourth resonance form is calculated to be exothermic
by Sturgeon et al.45 QM is the formation
of the quinone methide-structure. The rearrangement in the fifth resonance
would yield flavonoid-like structures as detected by Rasmussen et
al.21

Because there
are little or no changes in the phenyl content in
the pyrolyzate, there is a reason to believe that pseudo-lignin does
not contain this structure in a large amount. On the other hand, there
is a significant increase of component 12 (5-HMF) and
other furan-components in the pyrolyzate with the increase of the
severity factor. 5-HMF is visible in the NMR, but the intensity of
the peaks are low and do not correspond to the increase seen in the
pyrolyzate. There are also several other components appearing with
log R0 3.9 in the pyrolyzate such as: 2 (furfural), 3 (2-furanmethanol), and 7 (2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde). These compounds are related
to the pyrolytic cleavage of humins as shown by van Zandvoort et al.33 We propose that the byproduct formed by SE,
called pseudo-lignin, corresponds to humin because of the furan polymer
structure that was found. According to van Zandvoort et al.33 and Patil and Lund,35 the formation of humins from carbohydrates takes place under harsh
conditions, for example, high temperature and acidic pH. The acetic
acid released is consumed in forming the humin polymer; therefore,
after pyrolysis, the acid content drops and the depolymerized humin
increases with furan-like components in the pyrolyzate.

To support
that humins are formed under SE-treatment, FT-IR spectra
were recorded (Figures S3 and S4). The
untreated samples had IR transmittance at 1722, 1655, and 1594 cm–1, but in the treated sample (severity factor 4.7 (220
°C, 15 min)), there is instead transmittance at 1711, 1605, and
1515 cm–1. These results are in agreement to IR
of humins as described by van Zandvoort et al.33 Baccile et al.46 did structural
characterization of hydrothermal carbon spheres, revealing a structure
and bonding pattern similar to the proposed humin structure (Figure 1). These carbon spheres
were accumulated from carbohydrates and raw biomass with temperatures
between 160 and 220 °C. The solid-state NMR of the unsolvable
part showed a clear furan-ring polymeric structure, very similar in
structure as suggested by van Zandvoort et al.33 Tuercke et al.36 acid catalyzed
(0.1 M HCl) dehydration of fructose into 5-HMF, but noticed that at
temperatures from 200 °C the yield started to decline. They found
that this was caused by the formation of humin and other insoluble
polymeric byproducts.

To summarize, the changes in NMR spectra
do not correlate with
the increase in the KL content and therefore is not consistent with
the structure of pseudo-lignin, but they confirm the release of several
monomeric carbohydrates, some 5-HMF, and hydrolysis of lignin. The
SE-temperature of 200–210 °C is a critical temperature
for SE-treatment of biomass. This is the temperature where the inhibition
of enzymes and formation of pseudo-lignin escalates. At the severity
factor above 3.9 (210 °C), there is a decrease of acetic acid
in the pyrolyzate. We believe the acetic acid is consumed as a result
of polymerization with furan components to form humins. Several furan
components, especially 5-HMF, are increasing in the pyrolyzate with
SE-treatment. There are also small amounts of this that are visible
in the liquid NMR fraction, but the intensity does not correspond
to the amount in pyrolyzate. This strongly indicates that 5-HMF is
bound in a polymeric molecule not solvable in NMR solvents. These
furan-like components are known to be related to humin structures.
The conditions under SE are conducive for the synthesis of these humins,
with acid, heat, and water. Therefore, pseudo-lignin as the byproduct
formed during the SE-treatment of birch seems be a type of humin structure
and not a more condensed lignin structure.

Methods
Materials
Birch (Betula pubescens) stem wood
without bark was pretreated with SE.18 The
list of standards are listed in Supporting Information and is used for retention validation
of components.40 The hemicellulose 4-O-methyl-d-glucurono-d-xylan and cellulose
(powder) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The
milling was done with a Retsch GmbH 100PM (Haan, Germany) instrument
with zirconium balls (ZrO2) at 350 rpm, for 12 h with 15
min on/off increments.

Steam Explosion
The SE was done
on birch stem wood
at several different temperatures (170–230 °C with a 10
°C increment) and resident times (rt, 5, 10, and 15 min), see Table 1. The pretreatment
was performed at the SE facility, at Norwegian University of Life
Sciences (NMBU) in Ås, designed by Cambi AS. Three hundred grams
of dry matter of milled birch was added to preheated pressure chambers
(10 min). SE at temperatures of 170–200 °C was only done
with 10 min rt.18 These samples were dried
and stored in room temperature, before applying the powder to the
pyrolysis filament, with a micropipette designed for powder. The Klason-lignin
analysis was carried out in triplicates.

Pyrolysis–GC–MS
The flash filament Pyrola
2000 pyrolyzer (Pyrol AB, Lund, Sweden) was coupled to a GC–MS
(7890B-7000C triple quadrupole GC–MS instrument from Agilent
technologies) to characterize the volatile pyrolyzate generated from
fast pyrolysis of birch samples. The GCMS method and identification
was done as previously described, with a capillary column (TraceGOLD
TG-1710MS 60 m, ID 0.25 mm, and 0.25 μm film thickness, Thermo
Fisher Scientific).40 The total pyrolysis
time is 2 s, with a heating time of 8 ms, which is injected on-line
to the GC with a total run time of 76.4 min. The pyrolysis was a fractionated
pyrolysis which is, according to IUPAC system, “pyrolysis in
which the sample is pyrolyzed at different temperatures at different
times to study a special fraction of the sample”47 and in this case at 350 and 600 °C, before
each GC-run. The amounts of each component are a normalization by
maximum peak area and therefore only represent the change in the composition
as a function of the SE-treatment. Each pyrolysis has been performed
in three replicates, and the value shown is the average with corresponding
standard deviation.

2D-NMR HSQC
For the preparation
of NMR samples, three
different deuterated solvents were tested, DMSO-d6, DMF-d4, and acetic acid-d4. Generally, all of the different solvents
resulted in similar spectra. NMR spectra with DMSO-d6 as the solvent were chosen to present in this study
because DMSO is known to be a good solvent for lignin materials. DMF-d6 gave a somewhat better spectra resolution
but was not used, as the gain was small. The NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Ascend 400 spectrometer (400 MHz) as previously described.40 The SE-treated material was ball-milled after
drying and dissolved in the deuterated solvent for 5 min. Then, they
were filtered through glass wool, to remove any unsolved particles,
directly into the NMR-tube.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The IR spectra
were recorded on an Agilent technologies FTIR 5500 (single reflection
diamond attenuated total reflection-cell), with the solid powder after
SE-treatment, drying, and milling. The resultant IR spectra consist
of 32 co-added interferrograms recorded at 8 cm–1 resolution in the 4000–650 cm–1 wavelength
region.
