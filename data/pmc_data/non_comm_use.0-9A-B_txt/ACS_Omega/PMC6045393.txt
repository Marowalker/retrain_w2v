Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB)
was efficiently expressed (6.2 g L–1) in Escherichia coli by utilizing an N-terminal tag cassette
and the XylS/Pm expression system in a fed-batch
bioreactor; subsequent direct binding to EziG from crude extracts
resulted in an immobilized catalyst with superior activity to Novozym
435.

Introduction
In pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries,
there is a drive
toward greener and more economic alternatives to current production
methods, partly because of pressures on cost and demands from environmental
legislation.1 Biological systems and, in
particular, isolated or immobilized enzymes offer a sustainable and
greener alternative to traditional catalysis for advanced chemical
manufacture.2 It is of great importance
that streamlined production systems are used to produce enzymes. This
allows the enzyme to compete head to head with traditional catalysts
in terms of cost, performance, and waste generation of the process.
Consequently, enzyme production should be reviewed in relation to
culturing time, fermentation productivity, expression level, and the
necessity for immobilization to minimize the overall cost for the
target chemical process.

CalB is among the most widely used
enzymes for biocatalytic applications,3−6 possessing many of the desirable characteristics
of an efficient
and industrially viable biocatalyst, that is, excellent stereoselectivity,
chemical compatibility, and stability.4 The enzyme is monomeric, does not have a cofactor requirement, and
has high substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity.
Furthermore, it is easy to immobilize on hydrophobic resins because
of its specific surface properties and is active and stable in organic
solvents at elevated temperatures.7 Various
methods have been developed for immobilization of CalB,8,9 which in practical terms is a prerequisite for employment in organic
solvents.

Even with its high substrate specificity, CalB is
known to be promiscuous
in terms of substrate acceptance, reaction condition, and reaction
mechanism.10,11 Therefore, the enzyme is used
in a broad range of applications, including polymerizations, resolutions
of alcohols and amines, sugar modifications, desymmetrization reactions,
and ring opening of β-lactams.4,12−15 Today, the most commercially applied enzyme preparation of CalB
is Novozym 435,6 where the enzyme is immobilized
on an acrylic resin. This biocatalyst is used in numerous industrial
reactions,16 including the production of
biodiesel,17 enantiomerically enriched
ketoprofen,18 and glycerol carbonate.19

For recombinant expression of CalB, various
host organisms have
been applied, namely Aspergillus oryzae,20,21Escherichia coli,22−30Hansenula polymorpha,31Pichia pastoris,13,25,32−34Saccharomyces cerevisiae,35,36 and Yarrowia lipolytica.37E. coli generally
provides a high transformation efficiency, high plasmid copy number,
and high protein yield, making it the first choice for routine cloning,
protein engineering or sequencing work, and recombinant protein production.
However, if the native target protein undergoes posttranslational
modifications or complex domain organizations, other host systems
are often needed. Eukaryotic host systems for recombinant expression
provide glycosylation, albeit in patterns that differ from those of
the native host system.38 By contrast,
prokaryotic host systems, such as E. coli, are known to provide nonglycosylated proteins.39 CalB is a monomeric enzyme containing three disulphide
bonds and one N-glycosylation sequon,7,40 and it is
therefore not an ideal candidate for E. coli expression. However, mutagenesis has been used to explore the lack
of glycosylation on CalB. An exchange of the glycosylated asparagine
residue for a serine (N74S) did not affect the processing or folding
of the enzyme, although the activity level of the variant enzyme was
reduced.25 Because glycosylation of N74
is not required, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems
may be considered for CalB, as long as the disulphide bonds can be
formed.

CalB has been expressed using E. coli in the cytosol,22,27,28,41,42 periplasmic
space,23−25,43 and culture medium.29,30 Extracellular expression (to the culture medium) of CalB from E. coli has resulted in reasonably high expression
levels of CalB; 0.55 g/L (0.5 L shake flask culture)30 and 1.9 g/L (1 L bioreactor fed-batch culture),29 wherein the lion’s share of examples
is in the single digit milligram per liter range with intracellular
or periplasmic expression. Extracellular expression of recombinant
protein can reduce the cost and makes downstream processing easier.44 Because this organism does not usually secrete
recombinant proteins to any significant amount, examples of this process
with E. coli are valuable.

Results and Discussion
This research aimed to streamline the preparation of immobilized
CalB by further improving the expression in E. coli and the immobilization method to develop a reusable and effective
biocatalyst that can be produced in a fast and simple manner. We achieved
an improved expression level compared to previously published results
and could utilize the EziG enzyme carrier for fast and efficient immobilization,45 as described in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Streamlined process for preparing immobilized
CalB, giving a drastically
improved biocatalyst (compared to Novozym 435) in terms of standard
lipase units (TBU) when prepared from the cell free extract (CFE).

First, we reproduced the recombinant
expression system applied
for extracellular expression of CalB in E. coli BL21 by Kim et al.29 The applied expression
cassette template was designed in the common pET26b(+) plasmid containing
a pelB leader sequence (P), which translocates the expressed protein
to the periplasmic space by the SecB secretory system. As the protein
is transported over the inner membrane from the cytosol into the periplasmic
space, the P sequence is cleaved off.44 In the periplasmic space, disulphide bonds and proper tertiary structure
can be formed. After the P sequence, an anionic tag consisting of
five aspartic acid residues (D5-tag) was inserted before the E. coli codon optimized mature CalB gene sequence.
This expression cassette system, called P-D5-CalB, has given protein
yields of 0.031 g/L D5-CalB in a shake flask culture and 1.9 g/L in
a bioreactor culture.29 In our hands, the
P-D5-CalB expression system provided 0.040 g/L active CalB in shake
flask cultures.

To further improve the production yield of CalB
in E. coli, the proprietary expression
system by Vectron
Biosolutions AS (Norway) was employed: the plasmid pVB-1A1B1 contains
a backbone based on the previously published pJB658 and pIFN30SpelB
carrying the wild type XylS/Pm regulatory promoter
system46 and trfA with cop271 mutation,47,48 which results in an elevated plasmid copy number compared to the
wild type. The codon optimized P-D5-CalB sequence was cloned into
this vector with the addition of a C-terminal His-tag (H6), resulting
in the pVB-1A1B1-PelB-D5-CalB-H6 expression plasmid. The His-tag enables
immobilization on EziG, with concurrent purification directly from
crude extracts or culture media.

EziG, provided by EnginZyme
AB (Sweden), is a material based on
controlled pore glass, which is coated with organic polymer and chelated
Fe(III) for His-tag binding. Because of efficient mass transfer through
interconnecting pores and selective and nondestructive binding through
His-tags, a high enzyme mass loading can be reached without the loss
of activity caused by a high degree of diffusion limitation and deactivation.
His-tag binding to Fe(III), rather than the commonly used Ni(II) or
Co(II), gives a stronger (albeit less specific) bond resulting in
less or no leaching. Iron is also nontoxic; thus, the immobilized
preparation is suitable for a wide range of applications including
processing for pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical
ingredients. EziG is available in three different versions with varied
surface hydrophobicities. In this work, the semihydrophobic EziG Amber
was used, because it was previously showed to be the most efficient
for CalB immobilization.45

In comparison
to the P-D5-CalB gene construct, the new expression
system produced a greater than tenfold higher yield of enzyme in shake
flask cultures; that is, 0.46 g/L (expression in the Luria broth medium,
20 °C, 72 h), where the active enzyme was found in the medium
(22%) as well as the cell extract (78%). The active enzyme content
was calculated by the tributyrin hydrolysis activity (TBU) assay using
a pH-stat and enzyme active-site titration.49,50 No significant difference in the activity (440 TBU/mg) was observed
compared to CalB expressed in yeast.51

Following the procedure by Kim et al.29 (except that induction was performed with 2.0 mM m-toluic acid, instead of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside),
the combined N-terminal cassette with the XylS/Pm expression system was used for a proof-of-concept fed-batch bioreactor
production (E. coli BL21). An increased
extracellular expression was observed, and the yield was significantly
improved: 6.2 g/L of enzyme was achieved after 15 h of expression,
of which 4.2 g/L was found in the cell free medium (extracellular)
and 2.0 g/L was found intracellular (presumably periplasmic). This
yield is roughly 3 times higher than that achieved with the previous
expression system omitting optimizations.29 Inactive enzymes, misfolded or otherwise, were not quantified.

The new CalB-variant was immobilized on EziG, both from the culture
medium and the cell extract after osmotic shock. Prior to immobilization,
the cell extract was buffered (20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid, 250 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), EziG was then added, and immobilization
was performed with end-over-end mixing for 1 h before rinsing with
the same buffer and vacuum drying for 16 h (air sweeping is also suitable).
The culture medium was filtered and the pH was set to 7.5 following
the same immobilization procedure. No optimizations were completed
as part of this study, as the purpose was to test the result directly
to a standardized procedure. When tested with the TBU assay, more
than eightfold higher activity was observed for the EziG preparation
made from the E. coli cell extract
compared to Novozym 435 (Table 1), whereas the EziG preparation made from the medium displayed
comparable activity.

a Measured by pH-stat,48 10 v/v % tributyrin

It is conceivable that the difference of the activity between the
preparations made from the cell extract and culture medium can be
attributed to binding of contaminants occupying space on the EziG
enzyme carrier, thus giving a lower enzyme loading on the support.
This aspect, as well as optimization of the fed-batch cultivation
to further increase the titer and minimize the putative presence of
inactive enzymes, remains to be explored. Further work also includes
testing of the EziG-CalB for biocatalysis in organic solvents and
for the plethora of reactions for which CalB is used.

Conclusions
An improved yield of active CalB expressed in E.
coli BL21 was obtained (6.2 g/L) by combining a previously
published N-terminal expression cassette with the XylS/Pm expression system. When the enzyme was directly immobilized on EziG
Amber from crude extracts without prior purification steps, the resulting
preparation showed roughly an eightfold increase in the hydrolytic
activity compared to the commercially available CalB immobilized on
acrylic beads (Novozym 435). Thus, in terms of production and immobilization,
this simplified preparation of immobilized CalB does not compromise
biocatalyst performance. On the contrary, the achieved and still unoptimized
procedure gives an improved biocatalyst. CalB can be efficiently immobilized
by hydrophobic adsorption on an acrylic resin, in contrast to most
enzymes. Because an improved biocatalyst was achieved with the standardized
binding method used in the EziG technology and compared with the excellent
case of hydrophobic CalB immobilization, these results indicate that
the simple method used (Figure 1) can be applied to give efficient immobilized enzyme preparations
for a wide variety of enzymes.
