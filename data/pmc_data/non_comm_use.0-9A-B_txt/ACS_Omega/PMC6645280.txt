Nitrogen-doped multiwall
carbon nanotubes (N-MWNTs) with different
structures were synthesized by employing chemical vapor deposition
and changing the argon/ethane/nitrogen gas precursor ratio and synthesis
time, and broadband dielectric properties of their poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF)-based nanocomposites were investigated. The structure,
morphology, and electrical conductivity of synthesized N-MWNTs were
assessed via Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and powder conductivity techniques. The melt compounded
PVDF nanocomposites manifested significantly high real part of the
permittivity (ε′) along with low dissipation factor (tan δε) in 0.1 kHz to 1 MHz frequency range, suggesting use
as efficient charge-storage materials. Longer synthesis time resulted
in enhanced carbon purity as well as higher thermal stability, determined
via TGA analysis. The inherent electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs
scaled with the carbon purity. The charge-storage ability of the developed
PVDF nanocomposites was commensurate with the amount of the nitrogen
heteroatom (i.e., self-polarization), carbon purity, and inherent
electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs and increased with better dispersion
of N-MWNTs in PVDF.

1 Introduction
Multifunctional
polymer-based nanocomposites containing conducting
carbonaceous nanofillers have gained a great deal of interest as charge-storage
materials.1−3 Materials possessing a high real permittivity (ε′)
coupled with a low dissipation factor (tan δε) measured over broadband frequency range are highly desired in modern
electronics and communication sectors. In this context, poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF) and its co-polymers have attracted significant research
interest, due to their large dielectric constant versus other conventional
polymers.4,5

PVDF offers various advantages, such
as flexibility, easy processability,
and lightweight, compared to the traditional charge-storing ceramics.
Nevertheless, the inferior inherent dielectric constant of PVDF over
ceramics limits its widespread applications. Hence, in the context
of charge-storing ability, it is important to enhance the dielectric
constant of the polymer alongside with retaining a small dielectric
loss. In this framework, polymer nanocomposites containing carbonaceous
nanofillers, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene sheets,
have shown interesting outcomes toward enhancing the dielectric constant
of the system and surmounting the issues related to traditional ceramic
materials.6,7

Over the years, the chemical and structural
modifications of functional
fillers have become an effective way to tailor the inherent properties
of these fillers to use them for the charge-storage applications.7−9 In this context, the unique technique of nitrogen doping of CNTs
was employed to incorporate polarizing centers (i.e., self-polarization)
within CNTs, facilitating large real permittivity.5,10−13 In fact, enhanced real permittivity derived from nitrogen-doped
multiwall carbon nanotubes (N-MWNTs) in polymer-based nanocomposites
can be effectively used for charge-storage applications.

In
this work, nitrogen doping was employed as a tool to tune the
dielectric performance of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown multiwall
carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and therefrom prepared PVDF-based nanocomposites.
In the case of CVD method, there is no need of patterned substrate
for CNT growth. Moreover, this method provides a large degree of freedom
in developing structural and functional properties of CNTs. The effects
of synthesis temperature and type of catalyst used to grow nitrogen-doped
MWNTs on structural properties of N-MWNTs have been reported in the
literature.5,11,13 On the other hand, the effect of synthesis time, which governs the
growth of MWNTs, and precursors’ gas ratio (i.e., the source
of carbon and nitrogen), which defines the carbon purity and amount
of polarizing centers, on the functional properties of N-MWNTs remained
unexplored. Therefore, to gain a complete understanding of N-MWNTs
synthesis parameters and their effect on structural and electrical
properties of N-MWNTs, various influential parameters, such as carbon
purity, structural defects, amount of nitrogen content, and inherent
electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs, were varied by altering the CNT
synthesis time and the precursors’ gas ratio. Thereafter, the
effects of these parameters on the broadband dielectric properties
of PVDF/N-MWNTs nanocomposites were explored. Accordingly, this study
builds strong ground about the interplay between N-MWNTs synthesis
condition, N-MWNTs structure, and resulting broadband dielectric properties
of the nanocomposites thereof.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Properties of N-MWNTs
2.1.1 Morphology by Transmission
Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
The overall morphology, graphitic wall structure, and
aspect ratio of CNTs play vital roles on the intrinsic electrical
properties of CNTs as well as the properties of their polymer-based
nanocomposites. It is well known that the conductive network formation
of CNTs in a given polymer matrix is greatly controlled by the aspect
ratio and the electronic structure of the CNTs.14,15 Therefore, overall morphology, graphitic wall structure, length,
and diameter of the synthesized N-MWNTs were assessed using TEM analysis. Figure 1 shows representative
TEM micrographs of N-MWNTs synthesized at different synthesis time
and gas ratios. On the basis of the TEM analysis, N-MWNTs synthesized
at various synthesis time and gas ratios revealed a bamboo-like structure
along with a closed cap assembly (see insets of Figure 1a–g). It can be noticed that during
N-MWNTs growth, the outer wall of N-MWNTs grew straight; however,
inner walls significantly distorted inward, eventually leading to
closed channels. This further results in uneven wall thickness and
decreased crystallinity of the graphitic structure.

Figure 1 TEM micrographs of N-MWNTs
synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50
at different synthesis time (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1.0 h, (c) 2.0 h, and (d)
3.0 h; and at synthesis time of 2.0 h at different gas ratios (e)
50:20:80, (f) 50:80:20, and (g) 70:70:70. TEM micrograph of N-MWNTs
synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50 and 2.0 h synthesis time is presented
in (c). High-magnification micrographs are shown as inset.

The bamboo-like structure of N-MWNTs is widely
reported in the
literature and has been ascribed to the substitution of the nitrogen
atoms in the graphitic structure of MWNTs.16−20 However, it is assumed that this unique structure
is not only governed by the substituted nitrogen atom, but also controlled
by the catalyst and nitrogen source used to grow N-MWNTs.5,21−24

The length distribution and average diameter of N-MWNTs were
studied
using TEM, and are listed in Table 1. The effect of synthesis time on the length of N-MWNTs
is very evident from the TEM analysis, where N-MWNTs synthesized at
0.5 h depicted longest N-MWNTs over 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 h along with
a broad length distribution. Previously, it has been shown that the
incorporation of nitrogen in the structure of MWNTs significantly
reduces the length,5,23 mainly due to the bamboo-like
structure of N-MWNTs, where a reduced amount of carbon takes part
in the axial growth of N-MWNTs. From the XPS analysis (discussed later),
a direct relationship between the nitrogen content and the synthesis
time was observed. Hence, higher content of nitrogen in N-MWNTs structure
led to a more distorted structure along with a limited axial growth.
This could justify lower length of N-MWNTs synthesized at 1.0 h. Moreover,
large variations in the diameters of the synthesized N-MWNTs were
observed (Table 1).
The diameter of N-MWNTs was slightly higher at the longest synthesis
time (i.e., 2.0 and 3.0 h). Since the diameter of MWNTs linearly varies
with the size of the catalyst, increased diameter of N-MWNTs in this
case is attributed to the sintering of catalyst particles at the longer
synthesis time.

and Mean Diameters for N-MWNTs Synthesized by Varying Synthesis Time
and Gas Ratios (Argon/Ethane/Nitrogen), Obtained from TEM Analysis

2.0	70:70:70	352	1458	5930	36 ± 12	
Considering the effect of the gas ratio on N-MWNTs
length and diameter
(Table 1), a very broad
length distribution was observed. The longest N-MWNTs were synthesized
at the gas ratio of 50:80:20, followed by 70:70:70, 50:50:50, and
50:20:80. Interestingly, the length of N-MWNTs scaled with the amount
of ethane (i.e., source of carbon) feed. Moreover, the role of nitrogen
in barricading the growth of N-MWNTs should be taken into account.
In case of N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio of 50:80:20, the longest
N-MWNTs were due to maximum ethane feed coupled with the lowest amount
of nitrogen. Therefore, it can be concluded that the feed of ethane
and presence of nitrogen in the structure mainly control the length
of N-MWNTs. Moreover, from the TGA analysis (shown later), it was
observed that N-MWNTs with higher crystallinity are also longer. At
the investigated synthesis temperature and time, no significant effect
of gas ratio on the diameter of N-MWNTs was observed.

2.1.2 Morphology by Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
Further evidence of the overall morphology of N-MWNTs
was found via SEM micrographs (Figure 2). The images reveal again that there is a broad diameter
distribution for all N-MWNT samples, which agrees with the TEM analysis
(Table 1). In the case
of N-MWNTs synthesized for 0.5 h, though the number of substrate particles
was fixed while synthesis, number of N-MWNTs was significantly small
and increased further at longer synthesis time (i.e., 1.0, 2.0, and
3.0 h). Higher amount of catalyst resulted in lower carbon purity,
which will later be verified with TGA. Similarly, the effect of gas
ratio on the purity of N-MWNTs was well evident. Small chunks of substrate
particles were observed in the case of N-MWNTs synthesized at the
gas ratio of 50:20:80, which are evident from the inset of Figure 2e. The SEM micrographs
of N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratios of 50:80:20, 50:50:50, and
70:70:70 show no significant presence of such substrate particles.
These observations will be later verified with TGA.

synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50
at different synthesis time (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1.0 h, (c) 2.0 h, and (d)
3.0 h; and at synthesis time of 2.0 h at different gas ratios (e)
50:20:80, (f) 50:80:20, and (g) 70:70:70. High-magnification micrographs
are shown in the inset.

2.1.3 Nitrogen Content by X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS)
The quantitative analysis of nitrogen
present in N-MWNTs was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). The XPS wide scan spectra for N-MWNTs synthesized at different
synthesis time and gas ratios are shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively. The effect of synthesis time on nitrogen
doping is evident from the XPS results, which show that the nitrogen
content is significantly enhanced by increasing the synthesis time
(Table 2). This might
be attributed to the decomposition of a higher amount of ammonia (i.e.,
a source of nitrogen) and larger substitution of nitrogen atoms in
the graphitic structure of N-MWNTs with increasing synthesis time
at a given synthesis temperature. However, highest incorporation of
nitrogen in N-MWNTs was observed at 2.0 h, and further decreased at
3.0 h. The presence of nitrogen greatly affects the structural stability
as well as the morphology of N-MWNTs, which was also evident from
the TEM analysis (insets of Figure 1a–g). It is also well established that the presence
of nitrogen in the MWNT structure leads to shorter MWNTs as compared
to MWNTs grown from pure carbon.25,26 In addition,
it was observed that the gas feed ratio greatly influences the nitrogen
content in N-MWNTs. For instance, the highest nitrogen content (i.e.,
0.88 atom %) was observed in N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio
of 50:50:50. In case of 50:20:80, though the amount of ammonia fed
was higher over 50:50:50, the nitrogen content was significantly less.
In this case, the incorporation of nitrogen was limited by the small
amount of ethane (i.e., 20 sccm) available for N-MWNT growth.

nitrogen content (atom %)	0.35	0.45	0.88	0.56	0.58	0.41	0.88	0.66	
2.1.4 Defect Content by Raman Spectroscopy
As per previous
studies, it is well known that nitrogen doping leads
to the generation of defect sites in the graphitic structure of CNTs.27−29 The incorporation of nitrogen in CNT structures leads to different
types of defects, such as pentagons, heptagons, and substitution of
the nitrogen atom in carbon hexagons.5,11 The above-mentioned
defects substantially alter the electronic properties of N-MWNTs.
Moreover, the generated defects could act as polarizing centers and
influence the dielectric properties of N-MWNTs.10,12

The effect of nitrogen doping on the structural properties
of N-MWNTs was studied using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra
for N-MWNTs synthesized at different synthesis time and gas ratios
are shown in Figure S3. To understand the
defects present in N-MWNTs, the intensity ratios of D-band and G-band
(i.e., ID/IG) were estimated, and given in Table 3. Considering different synthesis time, the N-MWNTs
synthesized at 2.0 h show the most defective structure, with an ID/IG of 0.94 ±
0.14, followed by 1.0, 3.0, and 0.5 h. The effect of gas ratio on
defects was apparent from ID/IG. The lowest amount of defects was observed for N-MWNTs
synthesized at a gas ratio of 50:20:80 with an ID/IG of 0.65 ± 0.49, followed
by 70:70:70, 50:50:50, and 50:80:20. The highest ID/IG of 0.98 ± 0.24 observed
for N-MWNTs synthesized with gas ratio of 50:80:20 suggests highly
distorted structure. The ID/IG was expected to be in line with the amount of nitrogen
present; however, no direct relationship between ID/IG and nitrogen content
was observed for either synthesis time or gas ratio. Given the Raman
spectroscopy and XPS analysis, it may be concluded that other factors
than nitrogen content, such as impurities, affect the Raman spectra.

N-MWNT	0.5	1.0	2.0	3.0	50:20:80	50:80:20	50:50:50	70:70:70	
ID/IG	0.67 ± 0.15	0.8 ± 0.34	0.94 ± 0.14	0.76 ± 0.41	0.65 ± 0.49	0.98 ± 0.24	0.94 ± 0.14	0.86 ± 0.09	
2.1.5 Thermal Stability and
Carbon Purity by Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
The thermal stability and carbon purity of
N-MWNTs were assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). All
TGA experiments were performed in air atmosphere, and residual mass
observed after degradation of N-MWNTs was assigned to the alumina
substrate and metal oxide catalyst particles (Figure 3).

Figure 3 TGA thermograms of N-MWNTs synthesized at different
(a, b) synthesis
time and (c, d) gas ratios.

The inflection points for N-MWNTs synthesized at 0.5, 1.0,
2.0,
and 3.0 h were recorded at 603, 603, 605, and 633 °C, respectively
(Table 4). Significantly
higher thermal stability of N-MWNTs synthesized at 3.0 h over 0.5,
1.0, and 2.0 h suggests higher crystallinity for 3.0 h. Since carbon
purity is inversely proportional to residual mass,13 it can be concluded that the carbon purity scales with
the synthesis time. For instance, N-MWNTs synthesized at 3.0 h depicted
carbon purity of 85.2%, suggesting relatively higher purity. This
is attributed to enhanced gas precursor decomposition at increased
synthesis time, leading to higher carbon purity.

Table 4 TGA Results of N-MWNTs Synthesized
at Different Synthesis Time and Gas Ratios
synthesis parameters	synthesis

ratio (sccm)	
N-MWNT	0.5	1.0	2.0	3.0	50:20:80	50:80:20	50:50:50	70:70:70	
carbon purity (%)	61.2	79.8	85.1	85.2	71.1	86.4	85.1	87	
inflection point (°C)	603	603	605	633	622	664	605	598	
The gas ratio also depicted a significant
effect on the thermal
stability and carbon purity. N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio
of 50:80:20 show the highest thermal stability and optimum carbon
purity, suggesting the synthesis of highly crystalline N-MWNTs. Interestingly,
N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio of 70:70:70 depicted two degradation
peaks, suggesting, at this gas ratio, two different types of N-MWNTs
were synthesized (Figure 3d). The poor thermal stability in case of N-MWNTs synthesized
at the gas ratio of 70:70:70 over 50:80:20 was ascribed to the amorphous
carbon and distorted structure, due to the presence of the higher
amount of nitrogen, as inferred from the XPS analysis. It was expected
that the less defective N-MWNTs result in higher crystallinity;30 however, in this case, amount of defects and
crystallinity observed from thermal stability was not in line. This
suggests that apart from defective structure, various other parameters
also control the crystallinity of the N-MWNTs.

It is important
to note that the iron catalyst substrate particles
are electrically insulative in nature and have a significantly smaller
surface area than N-MWNTs. The catalyst surface area also decreases
further at high synthesis temperatures due to the sintering process.
Therefore, the presence of substrate and catalyst leads to a decreased
effective bulk electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs. Hence, N-MWNTs
with high carbon purity are necessary for electrical conductivity
as well as for charge-storage applications.

2.1.6 N-MWNT
Powder Conductivity
The
inherent electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs plays a vital role in
defining the electrical conductivity and charge-storage ability of
their nanocomposites. The electrical properties of N-MWNTs are governed
by various parameters, such as graphitic structure, defects, and carbon
purity. To get a rough estimate of the inherent electrical conductivity
of N-MWNTs, direct current (DC) electrical conductivity of compressed
N-MWNT powders at different applied pressures was measured (Table 5). The electrical
powder conductivity was found to scale with synthesis time. This is
mainly ascribed to the higher carbon purity of N-MWNTs synthesized
at longer synthesis time, as obtained from TGA results. On the other
hand, the nitrogen content was also observed to increase at longer
synthesis time. The nitrogen present in N-MWNTs structure acts as
scattering points against nomadic charges, and thus decreases the
current flow in N-MWNTs.

and Gas Ratios

gas ratio (50:20:80)	9.2	11.7	14.8	18.6	20.0	
gas ratio (50:80:20)	9.3	13.1	17.2	20.0	20.9	
gas ratio (50:50:50)	8.9	12.9	17.0	19.8	20.6	
gas ratio (70:70:70)	9.6	13.1	17.4	19.9	22.4	
The gas ratio used for the synthesis of N-MWNTs showed
no significant
effect on the powder conductivity of N-MWNTs (Table 5). Slightly enhanced electrical powder conductivity
is observed for N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio of 70:70:70 (i.e.,
22.4 S/cm at 30 MPa) over the gas ratio of 50:20:80 (i.e., 20 S/cm
at 30 MPa), 50:50:50 (i.e., 20.6 S/cm at 30 MPa), and 50:80:20 (i.e.,
20.9 S/cm at 30 MPa). The N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio of
50:20:80 depicted lowest powder conductivity despite having less defective
structure. This was mainly due to minimum carbon purity of N-MWNTs
synthesized at 50:20:80. The N-MWNTs with high intrinsic conductivity
are expected to provide larger current flow in PVDF nanocomposites
via interconnected network of N-MWNTs.

2.2 Structure
and Properties of PVDF-Based Melt-Mixed
Nanocomposites
2.2.1 Dispersion of N-MWNTs
in PVDF at Various
Length Scales
The electrical properties of polymer-based
nanocomposites are governed not only by the inherent properties of
the conducting filler, but also greatly controlled by its dispersion
state in a given matrix.31,32 An effective dispersion
of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix is necessary to take advantage of the
excellent properties of the functional N-MWNTs in the nanocomposite.
The required conducting filler network should be achieved at low filler
loadings, implying that most of the primary nanotube agglomerates
are dispersed into individualized nanotubes while retaining their
initial length. Therefore, we made an attempt to investigate the state
of nanotube dispersion of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix at three different
length scales.

First, the microdispersion of N-MWNTs in the
PVDF matrix and the existence of remaining primary agglomerates were
assessed using optical micrographs, and quantitative analysis was
performed by estimating the agglomerate area ratio. Figure 4 shows representative optical
micrographs of PVDF nanocomposites containing 2 wt % N-MWNTs. The
effect of synthesis time on the dispersion state of N-MWNTs in the
PVDF matrix is very evident; the nanocomposite containing N-MWNTs
synthesized at 3.0 h shows the highest amount of agglomerates and
the largest agglomerates in the PVDF matrix, followed by N-MWNTs synthesized
at 2.0, 0.5, and 1.0 h (see Table 6). The PVDF nanocomposites containing N-MWNTs synthesized
at 1.0 h depicted the best dispersion of N-MWNTs with an agglomerate
area ratio of only 1.02 ± 0.35%.

Figure 4 Optical micrographs of PVDF nanocomposites
containing 2.0 wt %
of N-MWNTs synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50 at different synthesis
time (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1.0 h, (c) 2.0 h, and (d) 3.0 h; and at synthesis
time of 2.0 h at different gas ratios (e) 50:20:80, (f) 50:80:20,
and (g) 70:70:70. Optical micrographs of PVDF nanocomposites containing
2.0 wt % of N-MWNTs synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50 and 2.0 h
synthesis time is presented in (c).

gas ratio (50:50:50)	1.8 ± 0.2	52	
gas ratio (70:70:70)	1.09 ± 0.71	44.9	
In a method described first by Arjmand and Sundararaj,26 film transparency was used to analyze the dispersion
state of N-MWCNTs in PVDF and in this method, the amount of smaller
agglomerates with sizes equal to or slightly larger than the wavelength
of visible light (i.e., 400–700 nm) was determined. Agglomeration
at this length scale gives a gray appearance to the nanocomposites
films and decreases the transparency.26 The N-MWNTs synthesized at 1.0 h depicted better dispersion at this
length scale with a transparency of 33.1% versus 0.5 h (53%), 2.0
h (52%), and 3.0 h (36.3%).

Concerning the effect of gas ratio
on the dispersion state, the
N-MWNTs synthesized at the ratio of 50:20:80 provided the best dispersion
in the PVDF matrix with agglomerate ratio of 0.76 ± 0.26% compared
to 50:80:20 (i.e., 2.93 ± 0.81%), 50:50:50 (i.e., 1.8 ±
0.2%), and 70:70:70 (i.e., 1.09 ± 0.71%). For 400–700
nm agglomerates, the PVDF nanocomposites containing N-MWNTs synthesized
at the gas ratio of 50:80:20 depicted the highest transparency of
60.8%, suggesting poor dispersion of N-MWNTs in visible light length
scale, followed by 50:50:50 (i.e., 52%), 50:20:80 (i.e., 48%), and
70:70:70 (i.e., 44.9%). Hence, N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio
of 50:20:80 depicted better dispersion at both length scales over
50:80:20, 50:50:50, and 70:70:70. The severe agglomeration of the
N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix leads to a smaller effective aspect ratio
of N-MWNTs, and thus, at a constant loading, deteriorates the ability
of the nanotubes to form a network in the PVDF matrix.33,34

The nanoscale dispersion of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix was
assessed
using TEM micrographs (Figure 5) of nanocomposites with 2.0 wt % filler. Well-dispersed discrete
nanotubes are visible in the TEM micrographs of the PVDF nanocomposites
containing all types of N-MWNTs, along with small bundles of N-MWNTs.
Only a slight effect of synthesis time on the nanoscale dispersion
of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix was observed, whereas the gas ratio
showed a larger influence. For instance, PVDF nanocomposites containing
N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratios of 50:80:20 and 50:50:50 showed
severe agglomeration of N-MWNTs at microscopic and nanoscopic scales
compared to 50:20:80 and 70:70:70.

2.2.2 Broadband Electrical Conductivity
Broadband electrical conductivity shows the extent of response or
transfer of free charges available in a material when subjected to
an external electric field. In general, broadband electrical conductivity
is represented by σ = σDC + A(w)s. Herein, σDC represents
the frequency-independent direct current electrical conductivity,
generated due to the movement of charges in phase with the applied
electrical field, whereas A(w)s corresponds to the alternating current (AC) electrical conductivity
(i.e., σAC) caused by the out-of-phase movement of
charges and is generally frequency-dependent.

Figure 6 shows the electrical conductivity
as a function of frequency. The electrical conductivity of neat PVDF
depicts an ascending trend with frequency, suggesting that the observed
electrical conductivity is mainly due to dipole reorientation. In
the case of PVDF nanocomposites, electrical conductivity scales with
the amount of N-MWNTs (Figure 6). Depending on the synthesis conditions and structural characteristics,
the deviation from the dependence found for PVDF starts at different
loadings, illustrating the percolation threshold composition at which
the conductive network starts to form. This network formation is greatly
influenced by the dispersion quality and aspect ratio of the N-MWNTs,
whereas the electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs is governed by structural
defects, nitrogen content, and impurities present. For PVDF nanocomposites
containing N-MWNTs synthesized at 0.5 h, a significant increase in
electrical conductivity was observed starting at 3.5 wt % N-MWNTs.
At this concentration, the nanocomposite also depicts a semiconducting
nature, with a frequency-independent plateau at lower frequencies.
This suggests generation of the interconnected networks of N-MWNTs
in PVDF matrix, referred as electrical percolation.35 In case of PVDF nanocomposites containing N-MWNTs synthesized
at 1.0 and 2.0 h, electrical percolation was observed at a relatively
lower concentration of N-MWNTs, i.e., 2.0 wt %. Moreover, electrical
conductivity was significantly higher over 0.5 and 3.0 h at any given
amount of N-MWNTs. This illustrates that these samples show an enhanced
interconnected network of N-MWNTs, facilitating effective charge transport
at small N-MWNT amounts. Therefore, it can be asserted that the synthesis
time plays a critical role in designing the electrical conductivity
of the nanocomposites. The electrical conductivity results were not
in line with the microscopic dispersion (i.e., agglomerate area ratio
and relative transparency) as well as the nanoscopic dispersion of
N-MWNTs in PVDF matrix.

for PVDF nanocomposites
containing N-MWNTs synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50 at different
synthesis time (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1.0 h, (c) 2.0 h, and (d) 3.0 h; and
at synthesis time of 2.0 h at different gas ratios (e) 50:20:80, (f)
50:80:20, and (g) 70:70:70. Electrical conductivity as a function
of frequency for PVDF nanocomposites containing N-MWNTs synthesized
at gas ratio of 50:50:50 and 2.0 h synthesis time is presented in
(c) (Ameli et al.13—(c) is reproduced

reserved).

When varying the gas ratio, electrical
percolation was observed
at 3.5 wt % for all of the N-MWNTs except N-MWNTs synthesized at a
gas ratio of 50:50:50 (Figure 6e–g). For N-MWNTs synthesized at a gas ratio of 50:50:50,
a relatively low percolation threshold was observed (i.e., 2 wt %).
In this variation, it was observed that the electrical conductivity
results were not in line with microscopic dispersion (i.e., agglomerate
area ratio) of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix. This is due to the fact
that the electrical conductivity of PVDF nanocomposites is not only
controlled by the state of dispersion of the nanoparticles in the
PVDF matrix but also highly influenced by the intrinsic properties
of conducting fillers (in this case N-MWNTs), such as inherent electrical
conductivity, aspect ratio, amount of defects and nitrogen present,
and carbon purity. For instance, at 3.5 wt %, enhanced electrical
conductivity was found for the N-MWNTs synthesized at the gas ratio
of 50:50:50, having relatively high carbon purity, high aspect ratio,
and optimum powder electrical conductivity.

2.2.3 Broadband
Dielectric Permittivity
To study the charge-storage properties,
real (ε′) and
imaginary (ε″) parts of the complex permittivity (ε
= ε′ + iε″) of neat PVDF and PVDF nanocomposites
were assessed. The real part of permittivity (ε′) represents
the charge-storage ability of the material, which is directly related
to the polarization inside the material. The imaginary part of permittivity
corresponds to the loss of energy in the material. In the case of
charge-storing materials, the materials should possess high real permittivity
alongside with ultralow imaginary permittivity. In this context, the
dissipation factor (tan δε = ε″/ε′)
is an effective measure for the charge-storing ability of materials.

Figure 7 shows the
real permittivity as a function of frequency for neat PVDF and PVDF
nanocomposites containing various amounts of N-MWNTs, and values at
1 kHz are summarized in Table 7 together with the values of tan δε. In the case of PVDF/N-MWNT nanocomposites, due to significant differences
in the conductivity of the matrix (i.e., PVDF) and the filler (i.e.,
N-MWNTs), the interfacial polarization is overwhelming. In this case,
nomadic charges get accumulated at the interfaces, leading to charge
polarization. Since interfacial polarization occurs at a large relaxation
time, this phenomenon is predominant at lower frequencies and becomes
negligible at higher frequencies. This is well evident from the frequency-dependent
analysis of the dielectric permittivity of the PVDF nanocomposites
(Figure 7). In the
case of PVDF nanocomposites, real permittivity scales with the amount
of N-MWNTs, whereby again, depending on synthesis conditions, different
amounts of nanotubes are needed to show a deviation from the curve
found for pure PVDF. It is well established that the formation of
nanocapacitors (adjacent conducting N-MWNTs surrounded by thin insulating
layer of the polymer matrix) in a multiphase system, such as conductive
polymer nanocomposites, greatly controls the interfacial polarization
as well as the electronic polarization.36 Therefore, with increasing the amount of N-MWNTs in the PVDF nanocomposites,
the distance between discrete N-MWNTs decreases, leading to the generation
of nanocapacitors. This further results in enhanced capacitance in
the materials as well as real permittivity.

In case of the PVDF nanocomposites containing N-MWNTs, ε′
is in line with the observed electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites
and scales with the amount of N-MWNTs. Thereby, better connected networks
of N-MWNTs, facilitated by proper dispersion of higher aspect ratio
N-MWNTs, combined with higher carbon purity in the PVDF matrix resulted
in larger values of ε′. Moreover, apart from interfacial
polarization in nanocomposites, self-polarization in N-MWNTs, arising
from the presence of nitrogen and structural defects, also led to
enhanced ε′. However, ε′ was not in line
with the amount of nitrogen and defects present. This was due to the
overwhelming effect of electrical conductivity, arising from the interconnected
network of conducting N-MWNTs on ε′.

For instance,
owing to well-connected network of efficiently dispersed
N-MWNTs (i.e., high electrical conductivity) as well as a higher amount
of self-polarization, the PVDF nanocomposites containing 3.5 wt %
N-MWNTs synthesized at 1.0 h depicted the highest ε′
of 109.7 over 0.5, 2.0, and 3.0 h at 1 kHz (Table 7). The tuned functional properties of N-MWNTs
by varying gas ratios depicted noteworthy effect on ε′
of PVDF nanocomposites, where significantly enhanced ε′
in the case of N-MWCNTs synthesized at the gas ratio of 50:50:50 was
due to relatively higher electrical conductivity (i.e., better interconnected
networks) and a higher amount of nitrogen content (i.e., self-polarization).

2.2.4 Broadband Dissipation Factor (tan δε)
The broadband dissipation factor
(tan δε) is an essential parameter for
charge-storage applications and determines the energy loss in materials.
For best charge-storage application, materials should possess minimum
tan δε. The tan δε is mainly related to the Ohmic loss, arising from the nomadic charge
transfer in the materials. Therefore, large tan δε in conducting materials is obvious. In case of conductive
polymer nanocomposites, interconnected networks of conducting nanoparticles
provide pathways for nomadic charges to move in the material, leading
to dissipation of energy and thus a large value of tan δε.

When an AC field is applied, as frequency decreases,
the time available for the transfer of nomadic charges is higher;
therefore, a higher amount of energy gets dissipated. This further
results in increased tan δε of the materials
with decreasing frequency. Figure 8a–d shows tan δε as a function of frequency for PVDF nanocomposites containing various
amounts of N-MWNTs synthesized at different times. The tan δε of PVDF nanocomposites is well in line with the electrical
conductivity of the nanocomposites and is observed to increase with
increasing the amount of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix.

Figure 8 Dissipation factor (tan δε) as a
function of frequency for PVDF nanocomposites containing various amounts
of N-MWNTs synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50 at different synthesis
time (a) 0.5 h, (b) 1.0 h, (c) 2.0 h, and (d) 3.0 h; and at synthesis
time of 2.0 h at different gas ratios (e) 50:20:80, (f) 50:80:20,
and (g) 70:70:70. tan δε as a function
of frequency for PVDF nanocomposites containing various amounts of
N-MWNTs synthesized at gas ratio of 50:50:50 and 2.0 h synthesis time
is presented in (c).

Above the percolation threshold, tan δε considerably increased at lower frequencies, where the time for
nomadic charge transfer was higher. As observed earlier, the highest
amount of nitrogen present (i.e., polarizing centers), highest carbon
purity, and largest inherent electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs resulted
in high ε′. In contrast, a large amount of nitrogen and
defect sites, low aspect ratio, and poor dispersion in the PVDF matrix
led to the lack of or less developed interconnected network of N-MWNTs,
resulting in restricted movement of nomadic charges, and thus smaller
tan δε. For instance, in the case of
PVDF nanocomposites containing 3.5 wt % N-MWNTs synthesized at 3.0
h, at 1 kHz, significantly higher ε′ of 24.8 alongside
a very small dissipation factor (i.e., ) of 0.83 was observed (Table 7). This confirms enhanced
charge-storage
ability of the fabricated nanocomposites.

In case of the PVDF
nanocomposites containing N-MWNTs synthesized
at different gas ratios, tan δε was
observed to be in line with the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites
(Figure 8e–g).
Herein, high carbon purity, large inherent electrical conductivity,
and less amount of nitrogen, i.e., less scattering centers for nomadic
charges, led to the highest current leakage through N-MWNTs networks
and thus largest tan δε. On the other
hand, Table 7 shows
PVDF nanocomposites containing 3.5 wt % N-MWNTs synthesized at the
gas ratios of 50:20:80 and 70:70:70 depicted a dissipation factor
of 0.41 along with significantly higher ε′ of 32.8 over
neat PVDF (i.e., 7.7) at 1 kHz. This originates from the higher amount
of nitrogen present in N-MWNTs and better dispersion, which results
in higher ε′ through self-polarization and interfacial
polarization. The low tan δε was realized
through a suitable balance between resistances offered by nitrogen
against nomadic charge transfer. This suggests that larger nomadic
charges can be stored in polymer-based nanocomposites (in this case
PVDF) by effectively dispersing nitrogen-doped CNTs with a specific
set of properties, which can be tuned by tailoring the synthesis parameters,
such as time and gas ratio.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the effect of N-MWNTs structure on the broadband
dielectric properties of N-MWNTs/PVDF nanocomposites was systematically
investigated. N-MWNTs with different structures and nitrogen contents
were synthesized by varying the feed gas ratio and the synthesis time.
Nitrogen doping was employed to generate charge polarizing centers
within the MWNTs, which facilitate large nomadic charge storage. It
was observed that various parameters, such as carbon purity, nitrogen
content, defect amount, aspect ratio, and inherent electrical conductivity
of N-MWNTs alongside their nanoscopic and microscopic dispersion in
PVDF, control the dielectric properties of the final nanocomposites.
The less defective N-MWNTs showed higher thermal stability, whereas
a larger amount of carbon precursor resulted in higher carbon purity.
Higher crystallinity in N-MWNTs correlated with the growth of longer
N-MWNTs, which resulted in better interconnected network of N-MWNTs
in PVDF (i.e., there was a higher conductivity at a given loading
above percolation). The inherent electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs
scaled with the carbon purity. It was expected that the final electrical
conductivity scales with the inherent conductivity of N-MWNTs; however,
in this study, it was strongly influenced by the dispersion quality
and aspect ratio of the N-MWNTs. Finally, enhanced charge storage
in N-MWNT/PVDF nanocomposites was achieved by the higher amount of
nitrogen heteroatoms (i.e., large self-polarization), high carbon
purity, and better dispersion quality of N-MWNTs in PVDF matrix. Finally,
in the PVDF-based nanocomposites, the best combinations of high values
of the real part of complex permittivity (ε′) and lowest
tan δε were achieved for N-MWNTs synthesized
at the gas ratios of argon/ethane/nitrogen 50:20:80 and 70:70:70 at
2.0 h, followed by those synthesized at the gas ratio of 50:50:50
for 3.0 h.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
A semicrystalline PVDF
polymer (11008/0001) with a melting point of 160 °C and an average
density of 1.78 g/cm3 was procured from 3M Canada. N-MWNTs
were grown on Fe catalyst using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique,
described in a previous work.11 To study
the effect of synthesis time, N-MWNTs were synthesized at four different
synthesis time (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 h) at 750 °C with
an argon/ethane/nitrogen mixture of 50:50:50 sccm. Since precursors’
gas ratio greatly controls the carbon purity and also influences the
amount of nitrogen present (i.e., number of polarizing centers), to
study its effect on structural and electrical properties of N-MWNTs,
a set of N-MWNTs was synthesized at different gas feed (argon/ethane/nitrogen)
ratios of 50:80:20, 50:20:80, 50:50:50, and 70:70:70 sccm at 750 °C
for 2.0 h. For a complete understanding of the effects of synthesis
time and gas ratio, the results of N-MWNTs prepared with synthesis
time of 2.0 h and gas ratio of 50:50:50 have been taken from a previous
study13 and compared with the results obtained
in this study.

4.2 Nanocomposite Preparation
The PVDF
nanocomposites containing various contents of N-MWNTs were prepared
using an Alberta polymer asymmetric minimixer (APAM) at 240 °C
and a rotor speed of 235 rpm. In a typical process, PVDF granules
were masticated for 3 min at 240 °C. Thereafter, desired amounts
of N-MWNTs were inserted into the APAM cup, and mixing was continued
for an extra 14 min. The PVDF nanocomposites were prepared with various
concentrations of N-MWNTs (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.5 wt %). A Carver
compression molder (Carver Inc., Wabash, IN) was used to prepare circular
samples for further characterizations.

4.3 N-MWNTs
Characterization
The morphology
and average size distribution of the synthesized N-MWNTs were assessed
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM micrographs
of N-MWNTs were captured using a Libra 200 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany)
TEM microscope. The quantitative analysis of the length distribution
was performed by estimating the distribution parameters of x10, x50, and x90, indicating that 10, 50, and 90% of N-MWNTs
are smaller in length than that of the specified value, respectively.
To study the general structure of the produced nanotube material,
scanning electron micrographs of N-MWNTs were captured using an Ultra
55 SEM from Zeiss at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV.

The quantitative
analysis of the amount of nitrogen present in N-MWNTs was performed
using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS ULTRA from Kratos
Analytical, England). The structural properties of individual N-MWNTs
were assessed using Raman imaging system WITEC Alpha 300R with a 532
nm laser. The thermal stability of synthesized N-MWNTs was assessed
using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments: TGA Q500). The
experiments were performed under air atmosphere in the temperature
range of 25–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The powder electrical conductivity of N-MWNTs was analyzed using PuLeMe
Pulverleitfähigkeitsmessung instrument. The electrical conductivity
was recorded as a function of the applied pressure. Further information
can be found in previous studies.37,38

4.4 PVDF Nanocomposite Characterization
The dispersion
of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix was assessed at three
different length scales. The microdispersion state of N-MWNTs was
studied using light transmission microscopy on 5 μm thin film
cuts from the compression molded samples using a Leica microtome RM2265
(Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The Stream Motion (Olympus)
software was used to analyze the agglomerate area ratio in percentage
(AA%). Another evidence of microdispersion
state of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix was recorded from the relative
transparency of the background of thin cuts. The relative transparency
reflects the amount of agglomerates with the size equal to or greater
than the wavelength of the visible light (i.e., 400–700 nm),
but smaller than agglomerates visually observable in the micrographs.
The nanodispersion state of N-MWNTs in the PVDF matrix was assessed
using TEM micrographs. For TEM imaging, 60 nm thin films were cut
from the compression molded samples using an ultramicrotome EM UC6.
TEM micrographs of the PVDF nanocomposites were captured using a Libra
200 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany) TEM microscope. Further information
can be found in previous studies.26,39

The
broadband dielectric properties of PVDF nanocomposites containing
N-MWNTs were assessed using a Bio-Logic impedance analyzer (SP-200
EIS) in the frequency range of 102–107 Hz. At least three different samples were measured for each set
of the PVDF nanocomposites. For the measurement purpose, a Solartron
12962 sample holder with an electrode diameter of 10 mm was connected
to a Bio-Logic impedance analyzer. All of the measurements were performed
at an applied voltage of 100 mV.
