If polymer chains could be fixed
on a substrate as a fully elongated
chain, a procedure known as “molecular combing”, the chain structure could be analyzed more precisely than
has been possible with the characterization techniques available today.
Although the molecular combing of a rigid biomolecule, DNA, has been
attained for the mapping of genetic information, that of flexible
chains has never been achieved as yet. We show here that poly(n-nonyl acrylate) (PNA) can be molecularly combed on mica
by a simple spin-casting method, and that the chain lengths were in
good agreement with that of the all-trans conformation. One of the
key factors for successful molecular combing was found to be the weak
adsorption of PNA on mica, indicating that flexible polymers may be
molecularly combed by adjusting their affinity to the substrate. The
molecular combing of polymer chains may open a new way not only to
characterize the chain structures more precisely but also to fabricate
new nanomaterials based on polymers.

1 Introduction
Polymers
with a flexible main chain, for example, those composed
of carbon–carbon single bonds, form random coil conformations
in a solution, and they can be deposited two-dimensionally (2D) on
a substrate by spin-casting1−8 or by the Langmuir–Blodgett technique,9 and the resultant 2D random coils can be observed by scanning
probe microscopy methods such as atomic force microscopy (AFM).1−9 If a flexible polymer chain could be fixed as a fully stretched
all-trans conformation, a procedure known as “molecular
combing”, the polymer structures could be characterized
more precisely than is possible using any of the characterization
techniques available today. For example, it might be possible to evaluate
the monomer sequence for a random copolymer chain, the distribution
of branches for a branched polymer chain, and the precise molecular
weights of each block segments for a block copolymer chain. However,
because of the large entropic elasticity of the flexible polymers,
the molecular combing of flexible polymers is generally considered
to be impossible.

On the other hand, for a rigid biomolecule
such as DNA, molecular
combing has been extensively studied with the aim of mapping genetic
information by direct observation with fluorescence microscopy, AFM,
and scanning tunneling microscopy.10−16 The molecular combing of DNA has been successfully achieved by several
methods. DNA was molecularly combed by simply extracting a substrate
from the DNA solution; the chain was combed at the receding meniscus
of the solution.10 Also, DNA was molecularly
combed by evaporation of its solution sandwiched between two coverslips.11−14 Again, the chain stretching was believed to occur at the receding
meniscus during the evaporation of the solution. Molecular combing
of DNA was also performed by translating a droplet of DNA solution
on a mica surface15 and by flowing a solution
in microchannels.16

In contrast,
the molecular combing of a flexible polymer has not
yet been achieved. During AFM observations of isolated chains of various
poly(methacrylate)s and poly(acrylate)s, we found that a poly(n-nonyl acrylate) (PNA) was molecularly combed by simply
spin-casting its solution on mica, and the lengths of the stretched
chains were in good agreement with that estimated for the all-trans
conformation from the molecular weight. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first observation of the molecular combing of a flexible
vinyl polymer. Here, we report the molecular combing behavior of PNA
and discuss a possible mechanism in comparison with the behavior of
some other polymers which cannot be molecularly combed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Molecular Combing of PNA
Figure 1 shows typical
AFM
height images of PNA(550k) (Mn = 5.5 ×
105, Mw/Mn = 1.19) spin-cast on mica. The concentration of the spin-casting
solution (Csc) was 1 × 10–5 g/mL. The positions at which AFM observations were made were at
every 1 mm from the center of the sample of 1 cm × 1 cm dimension,
as schematically shown in Figure 1. In all areas, fully stretched chains with a subnanometer
thickness (0.15–0.37 nm) were observed. The lengths of the
chains in each area are summarized in the histogram. The number averaged
chain lengths (Ln) are in good agreement
with that of the fully stretched PNA(550k) chain in the all-trans
conformation, that is, ≈697 nm [= Na sin(θ/2),
where N, a, and θ are the
number of C–C bonds in the main chain (5547), the C–C
bond length (0.154 nm), and C–C–C bond angle (109.3°),
respectively] within the experimental error, indicating that the chains
not only appear stretched, but they are close to the all-trans conformation.
To our best knowledge, this is the first observation of an almost
fully extended flexible polymer observed by AFM. The length distributions
(Lw/Ln) are
also reasonably close to the molecular weight distribution of PNA(550k)
(1.19). The directions of the chains were random and varied in repeated
experiments. There was no systematic dependence in the direction of
the chains relative to either the radial or circumferential directions,
indicating that the chain combing occurred in a complicated manner.

Figure 1 (a) AFM
height images of PNA(550k) spin-cast on mica at the positions
indicated in the schematic representation of the sample. (b) Chain
length distributions observed at each sample position. The length
of the all-trans chain of PNA(550k) is 697 nm. The RH at the spin-cast
and the concentration of the solution (Csc) was 5% RH and 1.00 × 10–5 g/mL, respectively.

As shown in Figure 2, the same molecular combing behavior was
also observed using a lower
molecular weight PNA(292k) (Mn = 292k, Mw/Mn = 1.28). In
all areas, almost fully stretched chains were again observed. The Ln and the length distribution were in good agreement
with both the length of the all-trans PNA(292k), 370 nm, and the molecular
weight distribution (1.28), indicating that the PNA(292k) chains were
also almost fully elongated. The directions of the chains were again
random and were different from those in Figure 1.

Figure 2 AFM height images of PNA(292k) (Mn =
292k, Mw/Mn = 1.28) observed at the positions indicated in a schematic representation
of the sample. Chain-length distributions are also shown. The RH and
the Csp was 26% RH and 1.00 × 10–5 g/mL, respectively.

In repeated experiments, molecular combing was observed in
most
cases (more than ca. 80% of the experiments), but at a low frequency
(less than ca. 20%), poor molecular combing occurred and, in an extreme
case, strong aggregation was observed. An example of poor molecular
combing and aggregation in parts of a sample while molecular combing
was observed in other areas is shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. At present, the reason
for poor combing is not clear. We first suspected that the humidity
present during spin-casting may affect combing; therefore, the humidity
dependence of the spin-casting was evaluated. The results are shown
in Figure 3. Over a
wide range of humidity from 6 to 58% relative humidity (RH) (Figure 3, first and second
columns), molecular combing was observed in most cases, and the frequency
of the poor combing did not depend on the humidity. However, in extremely
high humidity, 78% RH (Figure 3, last column), the chains were always aggregated. In humid
air, an adsorbed water layer is known to form on mica, the thickness
of which increases with the humidity, for example, ca. 0.25 nm at
60% RH and 0.5 nm at 78% RH.18 At an extremely
high humidity, the chain is spin-casted on the adsorbed water layer
on the mica, the thickness of which is larger than that of the chain;
thus, the chain structure may be close to that spread on a water surface
(Langmuir monolayer). The PNA monolayer on the water surface forms
a condensed monolayer, in which the chains are aggregated without
compression.19 Thus, the chains spin-cast
on mica at a high humidity are expected to aggregate.

Figure 3 AFM height images of
PNA(550k) spin-cast on mica under different
RH. The Csc was 1.00 × 10–5 g/mL.

2.2 Poor
Molecular Combing of PNA and Its Relation
to the Number of Adsorbed Chains
Although the poor molecular
combing occurred in a limited number of cases (<ca. 20%), these
results were found to be quite useful for understanding the behavior
and mechanism of the molecular combing. Thus, we will discuss the
mechanism of molecular combing by focusing the results of poor molecular
combing. Figure 4 shows
a typical molecular combing image (a) along with not-fully-elongated
chain images which were observed with less frequency, (b) poor elongation,
(c) compact chains, (d) partially, and (e) highly aggregated chains.
As already mentioned, the occurrence of uncombed chains was independent
of the humidity, except at an extremely high humidity at 78% RH. Although
the value of Csc was same for all images
(1.00 × 10–5 g/mL), the number of chains in
the AFM images varied. As shown in the images, with increasing the
number of chains observed in the AFM, the chain structure changed
from (a) molecular combing (1.6 chain/μm2), (b) partial
elongation (3.4), (c) compact chains (5.1), (d) partial (16), and
highly aggregated chains (32). This result clearly indicates that
the molecular combing occurred when the number of adsorbed polymer
chains was extremely small, that is, the polymer chains were weakly
adsorbed on the substrate.

Figure 4 AFM height images of PNA(550k) spin-cast on
mica. Typical molecular
combing image (a) is shown along with some not fully stretched chain
images which were observed in a limited frequency, (b) poor elongated
chains, (c) compact chains, (d) partially, and (e) highly aggregated
chains. The average number of chains deposited on mica is shown in
each image. The Csc was 1.00 × 10–5 g/mL. *The numbers of aggregated chains were estimated
by assuming that their number is proportional to the area occupied
by the chains for both the aggregated and dispersed chains.

Mica is a hydrophilic substrate,
thus, the PNA chain is expected
to be adsorbed via the polar ester group. The ester group content
in PNA is small because of the large aliphatic alcohol component of
the monomer unit. Next, to evaluate the effect of the ester content
on the molecular combing, we studied isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate)
(it-PMMA) and poly(n-octyl acrylate) (POA). We used
it-PMMA instead of atactic (at-) and syndiotactic (st-) PMMAs because
we have much experience of spin-casting of it-PMMA. We confirmed that
at- and st-PMMAs behave very similar to it-PMMA.

2.3 Spin-Casting of it-PMMA and POA and the Number
of Adsorbed Chains
Figure 5 shows AFM height images of (a) it-PMMA(290k) and (b)
POA(97.5k) spin-cast on mica. The Csc values
for each polymer were 3.00 × 10–6 and 1.96
× 10–6 g/mL, respectively, which were 1/3.3
and 1/5 more dilute than those of PNA (1.00 × 10–5 g/mL).

Figure 5 AFM height images of (a) it-PMMA(290k) and (b1,b2) POA(97.5k) spin-cast
on mica; the Csp for each polymer are
indicated. The length distributions of it-PMMA and elongated POA in
(b2) are also shown.

it-PMMA was always observed as random coils, and chain elongation
was never observed. The number-average contour length along the chain
was 254 nm, which is ca. 35% of the fully elongated chain (725 nm).
This is a common result for random coil chains because small waviness
of the chain less than the resolution of AFM is completely ignored
resulting in the contour length being significantly underestimated.20,21 POA was also observed as random coils in most cases (b1), but in
a very limited number of cases, elongated chains were observed in
a part of sample (b2). However, the average length of the elongated
chain was 88 nm, which is ca. 66% of the fully elongated chain (133
nm), indicating that, although the POA chains were elongated, they
were not fully elongated. Note that the number of random coil chains
of (a) it-PMMA and (b1) POA deposited on mica are much larger than
that of typical molecular-combed PNA chains, even though the Csc of it-PMMA and POA was more dilute than that
of PNA, indicating that the adsorption of PNA on mica is much weaker
than that of it-PMMA and POA. The number of the POA elongated chains
in the AFM image (b2) was again much smaller than that of the random
coils (b1).

The number of chains adsorbed on the mica as a function
of RH for
PNA(550k), it-PMMA(290k), and POA(97.5k) in repeated experiments is
summarized in Figure 6. The data were categorized by different chain structures, for example,
molecular combing, elongated chains, random coils, and aggregated
chains. Because the Csc was different
for PNA (1.00 × 10–5 g/mL, 1.82 × 10–8 mol/L), it-PMMA (3.00 × 10–6 g/mL, 1.03 × 10–8 mol/L), and POA (1.96 ×
10–6 g/mL, 2.01 × 10–8 mol/L),
the number of chains was normalized to Csc = 1.82 × 10–8 mol/L (nnormal), assuming that the number of chains deposited
on mica is proportional to the molar concentration of the spin-cast
solutions. The number of chains without normalization (n) is shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 Number of chains observed in AFM images
as a function of the RH
at the spin-casting for PNA(550k), it-PMMA(290k), and POA(97.5k) for
repeated experiments. The Csc for PNA:
1.00 × 10–5 g/mL (1.82 × 10–8 mol/L), it-PMMA: 3.00 × 10–6 g/mL (1.03 ×
10–8 mol/L), and POA: 1.96 × 10–6 g/mL (2.01 × 10–8 mol/L), respectively. The
data are categorized by different chain structures, for example, molecular
combing, elongated chain, random coil, and aggregated chain. Because
the Csc was different for the polymer
species, the number of chains observed in AFM images was normalized
with Csc = 1.82 × 10–8 mol/L (nnormal), assuming
that the number of chains deposited on mica is proportional to the
mole concentration of the spin-cast solutions. The number of chains
without normalization (n) is shown in
Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.

Although the data are scattered, nnormal did not depend on the
RH, except for PNA at extremely
high RH, where significant aggregation occurred, as mentioned above.
For PNA, most of the chains were molecularly combed and the nnormal is extremely small (red
filled circles, nnormal ≈
2 μm–2), and with the increase of nnormal, the chain structure became random
coils (red half-filled circles, nnormal ≈ 5) and aggregated chains (red open circles, nnormal ≈ 37). For it-PMMA, nnormal is large and random coils
were always observed (blue open circles, nnormal ≈ 68). For POA, when nnormal is large, random coils were seen (black
open circles, nnormal ≈
70), but for small nnormal, poor elongated chains were observed (black filled circles, nnormal ≈ 5). Apparently,
the small number of chains deposited on the substrate, in other words,
weak adsorption to the substrate is the key factor for molecular combing
to occur.

2.4 Partially Elongated PNA Chains and Their Combing
Directions
The direction of molecular combing could be assigned
using partially elongated chains. Figure 7 shows an example of partially elongated
chains observed with a limited frequency. In this experiment, partially
elongated chains were observed in every area. As shown in the magnified
images of a, c, and e, one of the chain ends was aggregated (green
circle) from which the residual part of the chain emanated as an elongated
chain. At present, we do not know which direction the chains were
combed, whether from the aggregation part to the fully elongated part
of the chains or the reverse. In a previous report, DNA combing by
a receding meniscus of a solution was followed by an optical microscope
in real-time.10 For partially elongated
DNA, the chain was elongated in the direction from the aggregated
part to the straight part of the chain. If we assume that a similar
process occurred in the present spin-casting process, we may assign
the molecular combing direction from the aggregation part to the straight
part of the chain, as indicated by green arrows in images (1), (2),
and (3). In Figure 7, as shown in b and d, some chains have a U-shaped character with
(b) one or both ends (d) aggregated. From previous DNA results which
showed a U-shape molecular combing with both ends fixed on a substrate,10,12 we can assign the direction of molecular combing as indicated by
the yellow arrows, the direction which was essentially the same as
the above direction from the aggregate to the straight part. Hence,
the direction of molecular combing was left up for area (1) and left
down for area (2). However, as can be seen in area (3) image, some
chains were combed downward, but some chains went upward, indicating
molecular combing had occurred in a complicated way.

Figure 7 AFM height images of
partially elongated PNA(550k) chains observed
at the positions indicated in the schematic representation of the
sample. Elongated directions as judged from the position of an aggregated
part of chains are indicated by green and yellow arrows in AFM and
red arrows in the schematic representation. The Csc was 1.00 × 10–5 g/mL.

2.5 Possible
Molecular Combing Mechanism
A possible molecular combing
mechanism based on the experimental
evidence is shown in Figure 8. In the spin-casting, when a droplet of a solution was deposited
on a rotating substrate, it immediately spread and most of the solution
was spun off, leaving, as a result, a thin solution layer on the substrate.
it-PMMA and usually POA were strongly adsorbed on the substrate as
random coils, probably with many adsorption sites, and during the
evaporation of the solvent, the chain maintained a random coil conformation.
On the other hand, PNA was adsorbed on the substrate weakly, probably
with a small number of adsorption sites. We do not have any direct
evidence, but, if we assume that molecular combing occurs at a moving
meniscus of the solution similar to DNA, the thin solution layer formed
on the substrate might become small droplets during evaporation, and
the meniscus of the small droplet then was moved by centrifugal force
or evaporation. The movement of the droplets might be complicated
and the evaporation of the small droplets might have occurred in different
directions and, as a result, the molecular combing directions were
random. If several droplets moved over the same area repeatedly, molecules
would be combed in different directions in the area. Thus, if we assume
inhomogeneous evaporation of the solvent, the various experimental
evidence can be explained.

Figure 8 Schematic representation of a possible molecular
combing mechanism
of PNA (blue chain). Behavior of it-PMMA and POA (red chain) which
are not molecularly combed is also shown.

At first, we assumed that evaporation of this thin solution
layer
would be homogeneous, and that molecular combing occurs as a result
of the centrifugal force produced during spin-casting. However, in
this case, the random directions of the molecular combing and the
mixtures of different combing directions in the same area cannot be
satisfactorily explained, and thus we discarded this possibility.

The PNA chains were stretched over the entire molecule. If the
chains were adsorbed on the substrate permanently even at a small
number of points, combing of the entire chain cannot be achieved.
Therefore, to facilitate combing, the original adsorption of the chain
should be weak and temporary, and the entire molecule should be able
to move significantly during the molecular combing process.

The random-coil chains and highly aggregated chains of PNA observed
in a limited number of cases may be explained by the inhomogeneous
evaporation of the droplets. They might form in a central part of
the droplet, where the movements of the meniscus were limited and
the solution was concentrated during the evaporation. If we could
observe over a wider area by AFM, we could confirm this. However,
as the scanning area of the AFM is small, we could not confirm the
structure distribution over a sufficiently wide area. An example of
a somewhat wider area observation of a sample which was spin cast
with a higher concentration solution is shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. The direction of the
molecular combing varied continuously, and it looks a trace of the
solution flow. Future work that continues such experiments may provide
more concrete information on the molecular-combing process.

Recently, we started studying molecular combing in a more controlled
manner, by extracting a substrate from a polymer solution, a way similar
to that reported previously with DNA.10 Our preliminary results indicate that some of the PNA chains were
elongated along the extraction direction of the substrate. Although
the experimental conditions should be optimized to attain a complete
molecular combing, this result clearly indicated that the molecular
combing occurred at the receding meniscus and supported the above
discussion on the molecular combing mechanism by the spin-casting
method.

2.6 Possible Contribution of the Long n-Nonyl Side Group of the PNA Chain to Molecular Combing
We have shown that PNA was successfully molecularly combed close
to its all-trans conformation by simple spin-casting. PNA has a long
alkyl group in its repeating unit. Because of the steric hindrance
of the bulky n-nonyl group, the chains should be
more rigid than those without a bulky group, an effect which might
support the molecular combing of PNA. Unfortunately, we could not
find out a detailed literature which describes the rigidity of PNA
in solutions. Hence, we discuss the rigidity of PNA and its possible
effect on the molecular combing of PNA using the available data in
the literature.22

Flory’s
characteristic ratio, C∞ = ⟨r2⟩o/nl2, where ⟨r2⟩o is the mean-square end-to-end distance in Θ state, n is the degree of polymerization, and l is the bond length, is one of the measures of the rigidity of a
polymer chain. From the Polymer Handbook,22C∞ for poly(n-alkyl acrylate)s are poly(methyl acrylate) (C∞ = 7.7), poly(ethyl acrylate) (10.9, 15.4), and poly(propyl
acrylate) (10.6). Unfortunately, the C∞ of PNA is not available. However, if we refer to the C∞ values for a series of poly(n-alkyl methacrylate)s: PMMA (5.7–9.0), poly(ethyl methacrylate)
(7.55, 7.7, 8.0), poly(butyl methacrylate) (7.85, 8.5), poly(hexyl
methacrylate) (10.1, 10.5, 12.1), poly(octyl methacrylate) (9.6, 10.4),
poly(dodecyl methacrylate) (12.9, 13.4, 14.0), poly(hexadecyl methacrylate)
(25.1), and poly(octadecyl methacrylate) (14.5, 20.4), we may suppose
that the C∞ value of PNA will fall
in the range of 10–20. The PNA chain is probably somewhat more
rigid than PMMA and POA but is still expected to be moderately flexible.
The bulky n-nonyl group may contribute to the molecular
combing of PNA to some extent, but the effect might not be crucial.

We used chloroform as a solvent which is a good solvent for PNA,
both for the n-nonyl group and the main chain, and
the concentration of the spin-cast solution was dilute enough (Csp = 1.0 × 10–5 g/mL)
that any specific aggregation or special structure such as micelles
are not expected. The PNA chains in the solution should be isolated
random coils. If we use a selective solvent such as n-heptane which is a good solvent for the n-nonyl
group but a poor solvent for the PNA main chain, the chain may be
solubilized in an abnormal structure,23 however, this is not the case in our experiment. In poor molecular
combing images (Figures 4 and 7), some random coil conformations of
PNA chains were recognizable, which indicates that molecular combing
occurred during the spin-casting process, not in the original solutions.
In addition, we note that a fully molecular-combed chain observed
in AFM is a single chain and not a needlelike aggregation composed
of multiple chains. AFM is sensitive and can distinguish a single
chain from a multiple aggregation. Figure S4 in the Supporting Information shows a molecularly combed PNA chain
with a small part of the chain folded at the end. The part of the
partially folded chain can be clearly distinguished by a higher thickness
and a wider width. The molecularly combed chains observed in AFM images
with a homogeneous thickness and width can be rationally assigned
as single chains. The molecular weight dependence of the length of
molecularly combed chain also indicates that the image is composed
of a single chain.

However, after spin-casting the solution
on mica and evaporation
of the solvent, the hydrophobic n-nonyl group should
not adsorb on the hydrophilic mica surface; thus, it will dewet from
the substrate and aggregate around the main chain of PNA. The highly
crowded n-nonyl group around the main chain may support
the all-trans conformation of the PNA chain. The length of the elongated
chain of POA observed in Figure 5b2 was about 66% of its all-trans conformation, which
may indicate that the less-crowded n-octyl group
is not able to support a full elongation of the POA chain. Although
it is not entirely clear at present, the length of a fully molecular
combed chain might vary depending on the local conformation possible
for a specific polymer used for an experiment. For a poly(n-alkyl acrylate) with a quite long n-alkyl
group, longer than C12, the side chain can crystallize in a condensed
state.23,24 The n-nonyl group is too
short to crystallize. Actually, the PNA is a melt at room temperature
with a low glass-transition temperature (−89 °C). The
condensed n-nonyl group which may exist around the
main chain of PNA is expected not to crystallize but to exist in a
melt state. The almost all-trans conformation of the PNA chain is
not affected by crystallization of the side chain group.

3 Concluding Remarks
We have shown that PNA was successfully
molecular combed on mica
by a simple spin-casting method. The number of molecularly combed
PNA chains adsorbed on mica by spin-casting was much smaller than
those existing as random coil conformations, indicating that weak
adsorption of the PNA is one of the main reasons that PNA can be molecularly
combed. The direction of the molecular combed chain was random, and
there was no systematic relation to either the rotation or centrifugal
force directions. The mechanism of the molecular combing is not clear
at this time, but we speculate that the solution spin-cast on mica
evaporated inhomogeneously, and the chains were stretched at the receding
meniscus of the resultant small solution droplets by evaporation or
movement of the droplets. Taking the flexible chain nature of PNA
into consideration, it is surprising that the chain was close to the
fully extended, all-trans conformation. At present, molecular combing
was attained only for PNA. However, if weak adsorption of the polymer
to the substrate is a key factor for molecular combing, as we speculated,
it may be possible in principle to comb other flexible polymers by
adjusting the adsorption force between the polymer and the substrate.
For example, adsorption between a polymer and a substrate could be
reduced by changing the solvent or adding a cospreading compound,
which disturbs the adsorption of the polymer on the substrate or by
modifying the surface of the substrate. The molecular combing of polymer
chains will open a new way not only to characterize the chain structures
more precisely but also to fabricate new nanomaterials based on polymers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
A PNA(550k)
with a number
average molecular weight (Mn) of 5.5 ×
105 and a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 1.19, PNA(292k) with a Mn of 2.92 × 105 and a Mw/Mn of 1.28, and
a POA(97.5k) with a Mn of 9.75 ×
104 and a Mw/Mn of 1.28 were purchased from Polymer Source, Inc. (Montreal,
Canada). it-PMMA with a Mn, a Mw/Mn, and a mm content of 2.9 × 105, 1.13, 98% (it-PMMA(290k))
was prepared by the isotactic-specific anionic living polymerization
of methyl methacrylate in toluene at −78 °C with tert-butylmagnesium bromide as an initiator.17 The Mn and Mw/Mn values were
measured by size-exclusion chromatography in chloroform using PMMA
standards (Shodex, Tokyo, Japan) for the calibration. The tacticities
were determined from 1H NMR signals of the α-methyl
protons. Highly purified chloroform (Infinity Pure, Wako Chemicals,
Osaka, Japan) was used as the solvent for the spin-cast solutions.

4.2 Spin-Casting and AFM Observations
A drop
of a polymer chloroform solution was dropped on freshly cleaved
mica rotating on a spin coater at 2000 rpm at room temperature, and
further, the mica was kept rotating for 1 min. The typical concentrations
of the spin-casting solutions (Csc) were
1 × 10–5 g/mL for PNA, 3 × 10–6 g/mL for it-PMMA, and 2 × 10–6 g/mL for POA
because the number of chains adsorbed on mica depended on the identity
of the polymer, as mentioned later. For spin-casting under a controlled
humidity, the casting was performed in a glove box, the humidity of
which was controlled by (1) introducing air from a humidity-/temperature-controlled
air supplier (PAP01B-KJ, Orion Machinery Co., Ltd., Nagano, Japan)
for high humidity or (2) introducing dry nitrogen for low humidity.
The spin-cast samples were immediately dried in vacuo for 1 h, then
observed by a commercial AFM (NanoScope IIIa or IIId/multimode AFM
unit, Bruker AXS, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) with standard silicon cantilevers
(NCH, Bruker AXS) in air at room temperature in the tapping mode.
The AFM images obtained are presented without any image processing
except flattening.
