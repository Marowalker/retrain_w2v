Amorphous
photonic structures (APSs) with short-range ordered arrangement
have attracted great interest because of their wide view angles. However,
the presented methods for the APSs color printing and 3D coating on
different substrates and curvatures are lack of control. Here, APSs
with angle-independent structural colors were fabricated by the self-assembly
of SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell nanostructures,
which were prepared by the hydrolysis of Fe(acac)3 on the
silica surfaces. The size of SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell colloids can be controlled well through the tuning
of SiO2 particle size, whereas the coverage of Fe3O4 on silica surfaces can be precisely tailored through
altering the mass ratio between Fe3O4 precursor
and SiO2. APSs with only short-range ordered structures,
uniform noniridescent structural colors, and high color visibility
can be obtained through the self-assembly of SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids of different particle sizes in a few
minutes. They are mainly attributed to the weak electrostatic repulsion
interactions between SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids
because of the partial coverage of Fe3O4 on
silica surfaces and absorption of the incoherent multiple scattering
of visible light from Fe3O4. Moreover, SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids show good adhesion to
various substrates, such as paper, glass, plastics, resins, ceramics,
and wood, which facilitates the formation of uniform APSs on different
substrates. Multicolor prints and 3D coating of APSs on substrates
with different curves and roughness can be realized on the basis of
the fast assembly of SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids.

Introduction
Dyes and pigments have
wide applications in paints, inks, and fabrics,
but they cause environmental pollution, are unstable under UV light,
and will fade over time because of their absorption of light.1,2 Structural colors, originating from selective reflection of the
light because of the interactions between the ordered structures and
light, have intrinsic advantages of environmental friendly mass production
and fadeless features compared with pigments.3−11 Artificial building blocks, such as SiO2 and polystyrene,
can be produced in a large batch, which is well investigated for their
applications especially for color printing.12 However, the traditional long-range ordered photonic structures
usually produce iridescent color, which means their structural color
would alter depending on the view angle and orientation of the sample.
This feature cannot satisfy the requirement for color display, in
which the structural color should not change when observed from different
view angles. In contrast to the long-range ordered structures, amorphous
photonic structures (APSs) have attracted considerable interest because
they show noniridescent structural color due to their short-range
ordered arrangement.13−15 These noniridescent structural colors obtained from
the APSs have important potential applications in paints, cosmetics,
textile, and displays.16−23

To produce noniridescent structural color, both top-down and
bottom-up
strategies have been developed to fabricate APSs. The former is usually
subjected to the time-consuming process, complex fabrication technologies,
and expensive instruments, whereas the latter has received wide attention
because of their remarkable merit of low cost, large batch production,
and simplicity. Until now, various strategies have been used to create
APSs, such as assembling two different sized colloids,24−28 assembling particles in ionic liquid29,30 or electric
field,17 spray coating,16,19,31−33 drop casting,34−38 electrophoretic deposition,39,40 infiltration-assisted
colloidal assembling,21 layer-by-layer
assembling,41 and microfluidic fabrication.42 These approaches can effectively restrain the
long-distance electrostatic interactions between colloids, thus resulting
in short-range ordered arrangement, but long-range amorphous. However,
most of the reported approaches fail in precise control for color
printing and coating of APSs on 3D substrates with different roughness
and curvatures. Furthermore, a proportion of additional black substances
are always required to reduce the incoherent multiple scattering of
light, but their distributions to the whole APSs may not be uniform
owing to the physical mixing process.43,44 Therefore,
it is highly desirable to develop new methods to deal with the above
problems.

In this work, SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell
nanostructures with tunable sizes were synthesized to fabricate APSs
for multicolor printing and coating of APSs on 3D substrates. The
SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids are prepared
through the in situ deposition of Fe3O4 uniformly
on the silica surfaces, forming a thin shell of black Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the silica surfaces. The morphology
and coverage of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on silica
can be finely controlled by altering the Fe3O4 precursor concentration. Through the evaporation-induced self-assembly
(EISA) of SiO2@Fe3O4 colloid solution,
APSs can be produced in short time, in which the color can be controlled
by colloids of different sizes. The APSs show noniridescent structural
colors with wide view angles (10–80°), which can be attributed
to the reduced electrostatic repulsion between SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids. Because of the fast assembly process
of SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids and good adhesion
of the colloids to various substrates, the prepared SiO2@Fe3O4 colloid solutions are versatile in multicolor
printing and APS coating on 3D substrates with different curvatures
and roughness.

Experimental
Materials
Tetraethyl
orthosilicate (98%), ethanol (EtOH,
99%), aqueous ammonia (28%), and Fe(acac)3 were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Triethylene glycol (TEG)
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used directly
as received without further purification.

Synthesis of SiO2@Fe3O4 Core–Shell
Nanostructures
Monodispersed SiO2 colloids with
tunable sizes were synthesized according to the well-established Stöber
method. The SiO2@Fe3O4 nanostructures
were obtained through the decomposition of Fe(acac)3 on
the silica surfaces. Briefly, SiO2 colloid solution (500
mg dispersed in EtOH) was first mixed with TEG (20 mL) with the help
of sonication (10 min), and then, Fe(acac)3 (350 mg, 1
mmol) was added to the above solution. The mixture was stirred and
heated to 120 °C for 1 h to remove EtOH and subsequently heated
to 210 °C for 1 h. After the reaction was cooled down to RT,
the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids were collected
by centrifugation and washed with EtOH at least three times. The products
were finally dispersed in EtOH for further use.

Fabrication
of APS Film
A very fast evaporation-induced
colloidal assembly strategy was used to fabricate APS films. Prior
to use, all glass slides and silicon wafers were cleaned by ultrasonication
in EtOH for 5 min and dried in an oven. Typically, the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloid solution (0.1 mL) was casted
on the silicon wafer (2 × 2 cm), which was then transferred to
the oven preheated to 70 °C. After heating for 3 min, the substrate
with APS film was obtained.

Characterization
The size and morphology
of SiO2@Fe3O4 were determined at
200 kV using
a JEOL JEM-2010 HRTEM. The optical microscope images were taken on
an Olympus BXFM reflection-type microscope operated in dark-field
mode. The reflectance and backscattering spectra at different angles
were measured by a NOVA spectrometer (Hamamatsu, S7031).

Results
and Discussion
The fabrication of APSs assembled from monodispersed
SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell nanostructures
can
be divided into three stages: (1) synthesis of monodispersed SiO2 cores, (2) overgrowth of Fe3O4 shell
on the silica surfaces, (3) and self-assembly of SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids, as shown in Figure 1. Monodispersed SiO2 colloids
with an average size of 230 nm were prepared through the well-established
Stöber method. Afterward, SiO2 colloids were coated
with Fe3O4 shell through decomposition of Fe(acac)3 in the presence of TEG and silica seeds at high temperature.
Finally, the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids
assembled into APSs through the EISA process.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the synthesis of SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids
for the fabrication of APSs.

Figure 2 presents
the SEM (Figure 2a)
and TEM (Figure 2b,c) images of SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell
nanostructures. Clearly, plenty of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
with an average size of 1–3 nm were homogeneously deposited
on the silica surfaces and formed a layer of Fe3O4 shell. A small proportion of free Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were also observed from the TEM images (Figure 2b), which is dispersed in solution. These
free Fe3O4 nanoparticles not bound to the silica
surfaces can be easily removed through centrifugation because of their
large mass difference. Measuring the distance between two adjacent
planes in a specific direction gives a value of 0.255 nm, which corresponds
to the lattice spacing of (311) planes of magnetite (Figure 2d). The crystallinity and phase
purity of the produced products were also examined by XRD. As can
be seen from Figure S1, the corresponding
diffraction peaks of the products can all be indexed to pure Fe3O4 (JCPDS No. 19-0629). No diffraction peaks from
impurities and/or other phases can be detected. The broad peak of
the XRD pattern indicated the small size of Fe3O4 nanocrystals. Calculations with the Debye–Scherrer formula
for the strongest peak (311) gave grain sizes of 1.5 nm, which is
comparable to the TEM observations.

of synthesized SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids.
The silica core size
is 230 nm. The scale bar in (a–c) and (d) is 100 and 5 nm,
respectively.

The size of the SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell
nanostructures can be precisely tailored from 200 to about 285 nm
by simply tuning the silica size while keeping all other parameters
fixed (Figure 3). Almost
all the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were uniformly attached
on each silica colloid, suggesting the versatile tunability of the
presented strategy.

with SiO2 core size of (a,b) 200, (c,d) 230, (e,f) 260,
and (g,h) 285 nm.

The loading amount of
Fe3O4 on silica surfaces
can be controlled by altering the silica and Fe(acac)3 ratio.
As the mass ratio of Fe(acac)3 to silica increased from
0.035 to 0.175 and 3.5, the amount of Fe3O4 nanoparticles
on each SiO2 surface was significantly increased (Figure S2a–c), and their corresponding
Fe3O4 loading concentrations were 1.3, 5.6,
and 12.0%, respectively. As shown in Figure S2d–f, the products turned from black, green, to pale green as the Fe3O4 concentration increased. Therefore, the optimized
concentration of Fe3O4 was determined to be
5.6% to enhance the color contrast and favor the colloidal assembly.

We then choose the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids
(230 nm) as the building blocks and developed the EISA strategy to
yield APSs. SEM images of self-assembled SiO2@Fe3O4 APS film at various magnifications are presented in Figure 4a–c. It is
apparent that the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids
are closely packed to each other and their structures lack long-range
ordering in the (111) plane. Two-dimensional FFT was also utilized
to investigate the APSs. As can be seen from Figure 4d, a ring-like feature of the Fourier components
suggests that the structure has a well-defined short-range order,
consistent with the SEM observations.

core size of 230
nm. (d) 2D FFT image of the SEM image in (b).

The amorphous structure of the SiO2@Fe3O4 photonic crystals (PCs) is probably due to their reduced
surface charge that interrupts their self-assembly process. For comparison,
we employed EISA strategy to obtain the long-range ordered SiO2 PC films. Because of the highly charged surfaces of the silica
particles, they could be self-assembled into highly ordered 3D lattice
(Figure S3) by balancing the repulsive
and attractive interactions between silica colloids during the solvent
evaporation process. The obtained SiO2 PC films always
show bright structural colors (Figure 6a) and angle-dependent structural colors. In comparison,
when a layer of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was coated
on the silica surfaces, the ζ-potential of the silica colloids
was reduced from −57 to −16 mV, far below the critical
value of −30 mV for electrostatic-stabilized colloidal suspensions.
This, to some extent, also suggests that the SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell colloids were not sufficiently
stable and may partially aggregate during the self-assembly process.
In the initial stage of the colloid assembly process, the SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell colloids can
be dispersed in solvent in a low particle concentration, where the
distances between the particles are relatively large and particles
randomly move in the solution, in which the particles are mainly balanced
by the attractive and repulsive forces. As the solvent was gradually
evaporated, the neighboring particles become closer to each other,
which results in the enhanced repulsion and van der Waals forces between
colloidal particles. However, as the charge separation of SiO2 (Si–OH → Si–O– + H+) was partially inhibited by the coating of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the attractive interactions will become
stronger than the repulsion between colloids. Therefore, the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids tend to aggregate in
a short distance in the solution. This means the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids can be balanced by attractive and repulsive
interactions only in a short distance that contributed to the short-range
ordered structures of APSs. To verify this hypothesis, we employed
a digital camera to record the EISA process at different times. As
shown in Figure 5,
the SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell
colloids were firstly dispersed in EtOH, which was then casted on
the glass before evaporation. As the EtOH evaporated from the solution,
plenty of brown aggregations with an average size of 200–500
μm appeared and could be easily observed and recorded. These
results strongly demonstrated our assumption that the SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell colloids tended to
aggregate during solvent evaporation, because of their weak repulsion
interactions between building blocks. Besides, the bumpy surfaces
of the SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell
colloids may also contribute to the formation of short-range ordered
structures, rather than long-range ordered structures.

The scale bar is 1 cm and is applied to all the images. (a) 0, (b)

To investigate the optical properties of the as-prepared
SiO2@Fe3O4 APSs, the reflection spectra
and the corresponding digital photos of the PC films fabricated by
SiO2 and SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids
were recorded (Figure 6). The SiO2 PC films exhibited
iridescence and strong reflection intensity with a narrow stop band
owing to their highly ordered nanostructures (Figure 6a,c). In comparison, the reflection intensity
of the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids PC films
was greatly diminished and their stop band was greatly broadened.
These can be attributed to the amorphous structures of the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloid PC films. Furthermore,
the peak position of the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloid PC films was slightly red-shifted to 515 nm compared to
that of SiO2 PC film because of the high refractive index
of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The reflection intensity
of PC film is usually determined by the degree of order of PC film
and the refractive index contrast between the building blocks and
the air. Highly ordered structures and large refractive index contrast
will lead to a higher reflection intensity of PC film. In our work,
the weight percentage of the Fe3O4 on the surfaces
of silica is only 5%, which makes negligible contribution to the refractive
index contrast. With respect to the periodic structures, the traditional
long-range ordered structures diffract light strongly according to
Bragg’s law, which results in the strong reflection intensity.
However, the APSs only have short-range ordered structures, which
decrease the diffraction intensity of visible light, observing a weak
and broad peak. The reflection intensity of APSs may be greatly enhanced
by carefully selecting a building block with high refractive index,
such as CeO2.45

SiO2@Fe3O4 PC films.

The APS films assembled from the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids showed bright structural color,
blue, green,
yellow, and red colors, and have wide view angles when directly observed
with naked eyes (Figure 7). The optical images of the four different PC films, which are obtained
from the SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids with
a SiO2 core size of 200, 230, 260, and 285 nm, respectively,
display almost identical structural color at various viewing angles
under ambient illumination (Figure 7a–7d). The structural
color saturation of APS film (Figure 7a–7d) was measured and
is shown in Figure S5. The colorful region in the CIE diagram specifies
a theoretical gamut containing all the colors sensed by the human
eye, with less saturated colors inside and monochromatic color on
the edge, which is also called spectral locus. The CIE diagram shows
that each point is close to the center of the spectra, which indicate
that the structural colors produced by the current APS film are less
saturated. However, the APS film still shows vivid structural color
under ambient light, which can be distinguished well by the naked
eyes. To test whether our samples do show angle-independent structural
color, the reflection spectra of the green SiO2@Fe3O4 PC films at various angles were measured. The
reflection spectra were measured from 0 to 80° by fixing the
source and the sample and rotating the detector. Figure 7e shows that the wavelength
values for the reflection spectra of the green sample were identically
angle-independent. Figure 7f is a plot of wavelength values versus the corresponding
detection angles. The spectral shifts of the reflection spectra that
were taken at several different angles were less than 5 nm, clearly
indicating that the structural colors were noniridescent. In general,
the short-range ordered structure of the PC film would result in white
color to the naked eyes because of their incoherent multiple light
scattering. In our presented work, because the black Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated on the SiO2 surfaces
absorbed scattering light uniformly, the SiO2@Fe3O4 PC films showed angle-independent structural color
with enhanced color contrast. Furthermore, the reflectance spectra
in Figure 7e are more
broadened than those for the long-range ordered PCs, which may be
due to the higher scattering intensity of amorphous structures.

Because of the robust synthetic method and the
quick assembly of
SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids into APSs, the
SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids have various
versatile applications for various substrates. such as color inks
or printing pigments. Before printing the colorful patterns, we test
the APSs assembled on various substrates to confirm whether our methods
are applicable in practical application. The APSs still show bright
color on the different substrates (Figure S4), including glass, ceramics, resins, plastics, wood and paper. Based
on the good adhesion of APSs on various substrates, we printed green
PCs on a paper in Chinese using SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids with SiO2 core size of 230 nm as the
color inks (Figure 8a). For the similar reason, a colorful rabbit with blue, green, yellow,
and red color was also printed by controlling the particle size of
SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids (Figure 8d). These prints showed bright
color visibility and angle-independent color for the naked eyes (Figure 8a–8f).

structural color with wide view angles: (a,d) 0, (b,e) 30, (c,g) 60°.

enlarged front view and (i) side view of the neck and tail, respectively.
The scale bar in (c) and (f) is 2 cm and was applied to the same line.
The scale bar in (g) and (h,i) is 1 cm and 2 mm, respectively.

Besides printing APS patterns
on 2D substrates, our strategy is
also successful in uniformly coating APSs on 3D objects of highly
curved and rough surfaces. For example, all the surfaces of the dragon
toy were coated with green APSs uniformly through one-step brushing
process (Figure 8g).
Meanwhile, the APS coatings keep the original morphology and details
(Figure 8h,i) of the
coated substrates, which is so called “conformal”. These
results strongly demonstrate that our strategy is versatile in printing
or coating on various substrates with flat/bumpy surfaces.

Conclusions
In summary, monodispersed SiO2@Fe3O4 core–shell nanostructures with tailored sizes were synthesized
for fabrication of APSs with noniridescent color by the fast EISA
method. SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids can be
obtained through decomposition of Fe(acac)3 on the silica
surfaces, and their sizes were controlled by tuning the SiO2 core size. Through the EISA process, SiO2@Fe3O4 APSs with short-range ordered structures were created
because of the scattering light absorbing ability of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the limited repulsion interactions
between SiO2@Fe3O4 colloids. The
APSs show angle-independent property with high color contrast, and
their maximum wavelength value can be tailored by tuning the SiO2@Fe3O4 core size. The presented assembling
strategy for APSs exhibits superior advantages such as multicolor
inks for printing and coatings on various substrates, including 2D/3D
substrates with different curvatures and roughness.
