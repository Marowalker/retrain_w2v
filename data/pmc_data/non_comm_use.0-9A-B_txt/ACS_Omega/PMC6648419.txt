Water-soluble chlorophyll proteins
(WSCP) from Brassicaceae form homotetrameric chlorophyll
(Chl)–protein complexes binding
one Chl per apoprotein and no carotenoids. Despite the lack of photoprotecting
pigments, the complex-bound Chls displays a remarkable stability toward
photodynamic damage. On the basis of a mutational study, we show that
not only the presence of the phytyls is necessary for photoprotection
in WSCPs, as we previously demonstrated, but also is their correct
conformation and localization. The extreme heat stability of WSCP
also depends on the presence of the phytyl chains, confirming their
relevance for the unusual stability of WSCP.

Introduction
Since the first appearance
of oxygenic photosynthesis about 2.5
billion of years ago,1,2 the chlorophyll (Chl) a-based photosynthetic process has profoundly shaped Earth’s
biosphere. Chl a has become a ubiquitous molecule,
a signature of life that is visible from space, making Earth the “green
planet”. This molecule has been selected during evolution presumably
because of its ability to absorb and pass on excitation energy during
light-harvesting and to undergo light-driven charge separation in
the photosynthetic reaction centers.3 The
molecular properties that make Chl a capable to perform
such diverse roles are of great interest and have been widely discussed.3,4 Primarily, the chlorin ring and its substitutions define the electronic
properties of the chromophore. Particularly, the intense absorption
in the red5−7 of Chl a is of crucial relevance
for its functions.8 The binding of a central
metal ion has been shown to contribute to the preservation of the
planar conformation of the molecule,9 and
the advantages of magnesium ion over other metal ions have been recently
attributed to the favorable tuning of the energy of its triplet state,
with a consequent lowering of the probability of singlet oxygen photosensitization.10

The role of the phytyl has been scarcely
investigated and mostly
connected to anchoring the Chls to the transmembrane proteins to which
they belong11,12 and affecting their packing.13 Fiedor et al.9 highlighted
that the esterification of the C-173 propionate also avoids
the self-chelation of the central Mg2+.

A class of
Chl-binding complexes in which phytyls seem to play
a pivotal role is that of the non-photoconvertible water-soluble chlorophyll
proteins (WSCP). These proteins, found in plants belonging to the Brassicaceae family, are quite distinct from the majority
of the Chl-binding proteins. WSCP is not involved in the photosynthetic
processes, as it is not a membrane protein and is not even located
in the chloroplast.14 WSCP consists of
a homotetrameric complex containing four subunits of about 20 kDa,
each binding one Chl molecule (Figure 1).15−17 A recombinant version can be reconstituted with either
4 or 2 Chls per protein tetramer.17,18 The biological
function of WSCP is still enigmatic,14,19−21 but it is reasonable to assume that it is related to the remarkable
stability of the pigment–protein complex. Tetrameric WSCP resists
dissociation and denaturation even at 100 °C.17,22−25 Additionally, the complex is astoundingly photostable,17,21,23 even though it does not bind
any carotenoids that are commonly involved in the photoprotection
of Chl-binding proteins.

polypeptide chains shown in gray cartoons, the protein surface in
transparent gray, and the Chls a in spheres. The
chlorin macrocycle is colored with carbon atoms in dark green, nitrogen
atoms in blue, oxygen atoms in red, and magnesium atoms in green.
The carbon atoms of the phytyl chains are colored in light green.
The inset on the right is a close-up view of the pores facing the
Chls.

A close inspection of the crystal
structure of L.
virginicum WSCP wild type (Lv-wt)15 reveals that the four phytyl chains protruding from the
Chl planes interact at the center of the Chl-binding cavity (Figure 1). This hydrophobic
interaction was assumed to be the driving force for triggering the
tetrameric assembly of WSCP complexes,15 since it was thought that in the absence of phytyl chains, no oligomerization
of WSCP occurred.23 However, in a previous
publication, we have shown that WSCP also tetramerizes upon reconstitution
of WSCP apoprotein with chlorophyllide (Chlide) a, a Chl a derivative lacking the phytyl chain.21

These tetrameric Chlide–protein
complexes exhibited similar
spectroscopic properties as their phytyl-containing counterparts.21,24 However, complexes of Lv-wt reconstituted with Chlide a showed significantly reduced protection of their Chls toward photodynamic
damage, as revealed by photobleaching measurements,21 and the complexes of Arabidopsis thaliana WSCP reconstituted with Chlides a and b were previously shown to be less stable toward dissociation.24 Therefore, the phytyl group appears to play
a key role in the remarkably high photo- and heat stability of the
WSCP complex.

The recently solved structure of the L91P mutant
of Lv-wt (Lv-L91P,
see Table S1), where leucine is replaced
by proline in the LCPS affinity motif, revealed striking differences
regarding the conformation of the phytyl chains in comparison with
the wt complex (Figure 2).26 In Lv-wt, the bulkiness of the leucine
residue forces the phytyl chains toward the Chl macrocycles. The closest
distance between the L91 residue and the phytyl chain is about 4 Å.
When L91 is changed to the less bulky P91, more space between the
Chl macrocycles and the backbone is available, allowing a reorganization
of the phytyl chains. Consequently, they move away from the Chl macrocycles.
A similar effect was reported by Saer et al.27 in the reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, where the mutation of residue M214 was shown, by solving the crystallographic
structure, to affect the conformation of the phytyl chain of one of
the accessory bacteriochlorophyll a.

Figure 2 Details of the phytyl
conformation in Lv-wt15 (Chl a in dark gray, L91 residue in gray)
and Lv-L91P26 (Chl a in
green, P91 residue in dark green). To ease the inspection, in panel
(A), the interaction between the L/P91 residues (of chain A) with
Chls a of chain B is shown. Panel (B) shows the interaction
of the L/P91 (of chain B) residues with the Chls a of chain A.

Intriguingly, in Lv-L91P,
the two phytyl chains within one open-sandwich
dimer adopt different conformations, with only one of the two protruding
from the Chl planes toward the center and thus breaking the symmetry
of the Chl dimer (Figure 2).

Due to the important role of the phytyl chains in
stabilizing the
WSCP complex,21,24 the question arose whether the
altered phytyl conformation in Lv-L91P-bound Chls has an impact on
their photo- and heat stability. To address this question, we compared
Lv-wt and its L91P mutant with regard to their photo- and heat stability.
By comparing the results of the Chl-reconstituted Lv-wt mutants with
those collected for Lv-wt reconstituted with Chlide, we were able
to assess the structural role of the phytyl chain and its conformation
on the WSCP stability.

Results and Discussion
Phytyl Chain Is Required
to Stabilize WSCP Complexes against
Thermal Degradation
To gain more insight into the role of
the phytyl groups in stabilizing WSCP toward thermal degradation,
Lv-wt reconstituted with the phytyl-free Chl derivatives (Chlide a and Chlide b) was investigated. To quantify
the complex integrity of the different WSCPs upon heat exposure, we
measured vis-circular dichroism (CD) spectra before and after a 5
min boiling treatment (Figure 3). CD spectra are good indicators for the complex integrity
because they depend on both pigment–protein and pigment–pigment
interactions. In agreement with a previous study on A. thaliana WSCP reconstituted with Chlides a and b,24 also L. virginicum WSCP reconstituted with either Chlide a or b were found to be significantly destabilized,
as evident from the significant loss of CD signal upon heat treatment
(57 and 32% for Chlide a- and b-reconstituted
complexes, respectively, Figure 3A,B) in comparison to that of the complexes reconstituted
with Chls (6 and 4% for Chl a and Chl b, respectively; see Table 1).

Figure 3 Heat stability of Lv-wt reconstituted with Chlide a (A) and Chlide b (B). Vis-CD spectra were recorded
before (black) and after (red) a 5 min boiling treatment. The spectra
were normalized to the maximum of their corresponding Chlide Qy absorption band.

a Heat stability was evaluated by
comparing the integrals of vis-CD spectra (350–750 nm) before
and after a 5 min boiling treatment. Photostability was quantified
upon illumination of the recombinant WSCPs under medium-strong light
conditions (500 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) for 0–60 min. The samples were adjusted to
the same Chl OD (0.005 at Qy maximum).
Emission maxima after illumination (F) were measured
upon excitation at the Soret band maximum and compared to the initial
maximum before illumination (F0). F60/F0 displays the
loss of Chl fluorescence after 60 min of illumination.

b Agostini et al.21

In the case of Lv-wt,
a crystallographic structure is available15 (by contrast to A. thaliana WSCP)
and therefore it is possible to analyze the interactions between
the phytyls and their surroundings. In the complex, each of the four
phytyl chains is in van der Waals contact with a cluster of hydrophobic
side chains constituted by L41, L153, and W154 of the subunit binding
the corresponding Chl and the side chains of the same three amino
acids of the opposing WSCP subunit (A with C and B with D, see Figure 1). The contribution
of the phytyl chains to these hydrophobic interactions in the core
of WSCP seems to be necessary for the extraordinary stability of the
Chl–protein complex, as the absence of the phytyl chains led
to a severe loss of complex heat stability (Figure 3). However, Chlides lacking the phytyl chains
are still able to support tetramerization of Lv-wt,21 albeit at lower complex stability, whereas in the absence
of any Chls, no tetramers form.17 This
indicates that the chlorin rings have a stabilizing effect as well.

As in Lv-L91P the phytyl conformation of the bound Chls is altered,26 by changing the interactions between the phytyls
and their surroundings, we were interested in determining whether
the hydrophobic interactions exerted by these phytyls still stabilize
the complexes against heat denaturation the way they do in the wt
structure. As evident from Figure 4, the CD spectra of Lv-L91P Chl a and
Lv-L91P Chl b did not significantly change after
the boiling treatment (Figure 5A,B). They exhibited a similar stability, as reported earlier
for Brassica oleracea WSCP wild type17,23,25 and Lv-wt.25 The calculated losses of signal intensity were 7% for Lv-L91P
Chl a and 8% for Lv-L91P Chl b and
are comparable to that of Lv-wt (see Table 1).

Figure 4 Heat stability of Lv-L91P reconstituted with
Chl a (A) and Chl b (B). Vis-CD
spectra were recorded
before (black) and after (red) a 5 min boiling treatment. Spectra
were normalized to the maximum of their corresponding Chl Qy absorption band.

Figure 5 Comparison between Lv-wt (A), Lv- L91V (B), L91A (C), and L91G
(D) (with residue 91 in gray, orange, yellow, and light blue, respectively).
The structure of Lv-wt15 is shown, with
the polypeptide chain in gray cartoons and the Chls a in green. The mutations have been introduced in silico with PyMOL
Mutagenesis Tool. Phytyls and the side chains of residue 91 have been
highlighted in spheres.

We conclude that the differences in the conformation of the
phytyls
in L91P, with respect to Lv-wt, do not seem to affect the heat stability
of the complex. In Lv-L91P, only two of the four phytyl chains, each
from an opposing Chl dimer, point to the center of the complex. Inspection
of the crystal structure of Lv-L91P reveals that each of the two protruding
phytyls is in van der Waals contact with the side chains of L41, L153,
and W154, similarly to the wt. Apparently, their presence in the WSCP
core suffices to stabilize the Lv-L91P toward dissociation to the
same extent as seen in the Lv-wt.

Side-Chain Length Modifications
at Position 91 Do Not Impair
Tetramerization and Heat Stability
Since apparently the side-chain
length of the amino acid at position 91 strongly affects the conformation
of the phytyl chains (as evident from the L91P mutation), we extended
this mutational study by investigating the effect of three more mutations
with decreasing side-chain lengths (valine, alanine, and glycine)
at position 91 (L91V, L91A, and L91G, respectively; see Table S1 and Figure 5).

All four studied mutants of Lv WSCP
(L91P, L91V, L91A, and L91G) were successfully reconstituted with
either Chl a or b, leading to tetrameric
complexes, as evaluated from size exclusion chromatography (data not
shown). CD spectra have been recorded in the UV region to assess the
secondary structure of the proteins, to verify if the mutations affected
the overall fold of the complexes. All variants were found to be characterized
by a UV-CD spectrum profile coincident to the one of the parent wt
variants (Figure S1), with an intense negative
band between 190 and 220 nm, in good agreement with the high content
of β-strands28 seen in the X-ray
structure.15 In this band, two negative
peaks are seen at 196 and 203 nm, with the former being the predominant,
as expected for WSCP complexes containing four Chls.17 Therefore, we could exclude any detectable rearrangement
of the loops and β-strands of the proteins to be caused by the
investigated mutations.

The absorption and vis-CD spectra of
Lv-wt and the four mutants
reconstituted with Chl a were nearly identical (Figure 6A shows the L91P
mutant, Figure S2A shows L91V, L91A, and
L91G). This indicates that all mutated proteins bind Chls at the same
Chl–protein stoichiometry, forming Chl dimers with an open-sandwich
geometry. Similar data were obtained upon reconstitution of the mutants
with Chl b (Figure S2B), with the exception of the L91P mutant (Figure 6B).

Figure 6 Spectroscopic comparison of Lv-wt (black) and
Lv-L91P (green).
Absorption (top) and vis-CD (bottom) spectra after reconstitution
with Chl a and after reconstitution with Chl b (A and B, respectively). Absorption spectra were normalized
to 1 at the Qy maxima. Vis-CD spectra
were normalized to −1 at the Qy minima.

When Lv-L91P was reconstituted
with Chl b, a significant
variation in the relative intensities between the Soret and Qy region, as well as a 2 nm red shift of the Qy absorption was observed in comparison with
Chl b Lv-wt (Figure 6B). In addition, the maximum of the Soret band absorption
in Chl b Lv-L91P was shifted by 3 nm to the blue.
The vis-CD spectra show differences between L91P and Lv-wt with respect
to the circular dichroism in both Qy and
Soret bands of bound Chl b molecules.

As the
CD signals in the Qy are attributed
to the characteristic open-sandwich conformation of the Chls bound,29,30 the observed alterations in Chl b Lv-L91P, with
a more conservative CD signal, indicate a modified Chl–Chl
interaction, presumably originating from a modified Chl–protein
interaction. This putatively altered Chl–Chl interaction in
the case of Chl b bound to Lv-L91P has been correlated
to the variation of the hydrogen-bond network involving the formyl
group of Chl b by comparing the crystal structure
of Chl b Lv-L91P with that of Lv-wt.26 In Lv-wt, the formyl group of Chl b is
expected to be directly hydrogen-bonded to the backbone nitrogen of
L91 located in the affinity motif LCPS, whereas, in the case of the
L91P mutant, this direct hydrogen bond is replaced by a water-bridged
interaction with the backbone nitrogen of C92, since no hydrogen-bond
donor is provided by P91.26 We assume that
this difference alters the Chl orientation in its binding site and,
consequently, the Chl–Chl interaction within the open-sandwich
dimer. This assumption is supported by the vis-CD spectra of the Chl b-reconstituted mutants (L91V, L91A, and L91G). In all of
these mutated proteins, the residues in position 91 provide a hydrogen-bond
donor like in Lv-wt and consistently they all exhibit nonconservative
CD signals same as those of the wt (see Figure S2).

The heat stability of these mutants was evaluated,
similar to that
for Lv-L91P. Similar results were obtained for the other mutants (Figure S3 and Table 1, all calculated losses of complex integrities
were clearly below 20%). Intriguingly, the Chl a-reconstituted
as compared with the Chl b-reconstituted complexes
seem to be somewhat less stable, as their calculated losses were roughly
twice as high. As the only difference between the two pigments is
the presence of a formyl group in Chl b, it is tempting
to attribute the observed difference to the capability of Chl b to establish an additional H-bond with its surrounding,
with a consequent increase in the stability. Congruently, it has been
observed, in the case of the major light-harvesting complex (LHCII,
a plant antenna protein that binds both Chl a and b) that the loss of Chls b affects its
stability more than the loss of Chls a.31,32

Impact of the Phytyl Chain Conformation on the Photostability
In previous studies, we have shown that Chls bound to WSCP are
accessible33 and can efficiently photosensitize
oxygen to singlet oxygen (1O2)21 but even so undergo only little photodynamic damage,17,21,23 even in the absence of any protecting
carotenoids. The underlying photoprotective mechanism that we proposed21 is based on the capability of the phytyl chains
either to shield methine 20 of the Chl macrocycle, which has been
shown to be prone to the reaction with 1O2,34,35 or to limit the interaction of the oxygen with the magnesium ion,
decreasing the residency time of the singlet oxygen near the Chl macrocycle36 and consequently decreasing its probability
to react. This mechanism has been proposed on the basis of the loss
of photostability of the WSCP complex when Chlide a is bound in place of Chl a, similar to the loss
of heat stability presented and discussed above (Figure 3).

The role of the phytyls
in the photoprotection of WSCP-bound Chls, shielding the more reactive
portions of the chlorin macrocycle, relies on the presence of the
Chl phytyl chains with a specific localization in the complex. Therefore,
it is expected to be highly dependent on the phytyl conformations,
as the phytyl chains are required to be in van der Waals contact with
the portions of the macrocycle involved in the reaction with 1O2. As the Lv-L91P complex has been shown to exhibit
a strikingly different phytyl conformation (Figure 2),26 we have tested
whether in Lv-L91P the bound Chls are still protected against photodamage.
To address this question, photodynamic damage was monitored, as previously
reported,17,21,23 by measuring
the decrease of fluorescence intensity upon photooxidation of the
Chls. After 1 h of white light exposure at 500 μmol photons
m–2 s–1, Chls a bound to Lv-L91P exhibited a loss of roughly 80% of their initial
fluorescence, a value that is 2-fold higher than that seen in the
Lv-wt complex (Figure 7). In the same time interval of illumination, Chl a as a control dissolved in 2% OG (w/v) has lost almost all (98%)
of its initial fluorescence, as has been shown previously.18 Obviously, the exchange of leucine at position
91 with proline has a drastic effect on the photostability, leading
to the question of whether this is a consequence of the less bulky
side chain of P91 with respect to that of L91. To address this question,
photobleaching measurements with Lv mutants exhibiting different side-chain
lengths in position 91 (L91V, L91A, and L91G) were performed under
identical experimental conditions.

Figure 7 Photostability of Lv WSCP variants reconstituted
with Chl a or Chl b (panel A and
B, respectively).
Lv-wt, black triangles; Lv-L91V, dark blue inverted triangles; Lv-L91A,
blue diamonds; Lv-L91G, light blue circles; Lv-L91P, dark green squares.
Chl a in 2% (w/v) OG (red stars) is reported for
comparison in panel A.21 All recombinant
WSCPs were illuminated under medium-strong light conditions (500 μmol
of photons m–2 s–1) for 0–60
min. The samples were adjusted to the same Chl OD (0.005 at Qy maximum). Emission maxima after illumination
(F) were measured upon excitation at Soret band maximum
and compared to the initial maximum before illumination (F0). F/F0 was
plotted vs illumination time. Data are expressed as mean values (n = 3).

By comparing the different
mutants (L91P, L91V, L91A, and L91G)
with regard to their ability to protect the bound Chls from photodynamic
damage, it clearly appears that the loss of photostability is gradual,
exhibiting an inverse correlation to the size of the side chain of
the residue in position 91 (Figure 7A and Table 1). This strongly suggests that the more the bulkiness of the
amino acid side chain in position 91 is reduced (in the series from
L via V, A, P, to G), the more the phytyl chain will be displaced
from its position in the wt structure, leading to a gradually decreased
photostability.

The same photobleaching measurements were extended to Chl b-reconstituted
complexes (Figure 7B and Table 1), obtainining
a similar trend (L ≫ V > A, P, G). Whereas Lv-wt complexes
reconstituted with the two Chls have nearly identical photostability,
the Chl b-reconstituted mutants show a slightly smaller
loss of photostability when compared with the corresponding Chl a-containing complexes. This difference does not seem to
be affected by the capability of residue to provide a hydrogen-bond
donor, as the L91P follows the same trend, and the difference in photostability
seems to be greater for the variants with smaller side chains of residue
91. Therefore, these results corroborate the hypothesis that the observed
difference in the photostability has to be assigned to a difference
in the space available for the phytyl chains to adopt their conformation.

The crystal structure of Lv-wt15 reveals
that the phytyls of bound Chls form a steric barrier between the chlorin
rings and the solvent masking the portions of the macrocycle ring
proposed to be involved in the reaction with 1O234−36 (Figure 8A,B), thus
protecting the pigments from photobleaching.21 Analyzing the structure of Lv-L91P,26 it appears that, by contrast, the reactive portions of the chlorin
macrocycle seem to be accessible (Figure 8C,D). Upon reorganization of the phytyl chains
of the Chls, induced by the less bulky P91 residue (see above), a
channel appears to be formed providing access for the 1O2 to the methine 20 of the Chl macrocycles and to the
magnesium ion as well. This may explain why the Chls are not photoprotected
any more upon exchanging leucine with proline at position 91. We propose
that in the series of amino acids in position 91 (L, V, A, G, P) analyzed
in this study, the gradual loss in photostability is explained by
the phytyl conformation being gradually altered upon the reduction
of steric hindrance exerted from the amino acid side chain, leading
to a gradually reduced protection of the chlorin ring that has to
be ascribed to a less effective masking of the reactive portions of
the macrocycle.

Figure 8 Comparison between the structures of Lv-wt15 (panels A and B) and Lv-L91P26 (panels
C and D), focused on the solvent-accessible part of the Chl molecule
in the cavity (highlighted with a black ellipse). The same view is
reported in the four panels, with the polypeptide chains in gray cartoons
(protein surface in transparent gray in panels B and D) and the Chls a constituting a dimer shown either in sticks (A and C)
or in spheres (B and D). The chlorin macrocycle is colored with carbon
atoms in dark green, the methine carbon 20 in yellow, nitrogen atoms
in blue, oxygen atoms in red, and magnesium atoms in gray. The carbon
atoms of the phytyl chains are colored in light green.

The modification of the available space inside
the cavity, besides
allowing for changes in the static structure of the phytyl chains
(see Figure 2), in
principle, could also cause an increase of the phytyl conformational
freedom. We compared the B-factors of the atoms of the Chls bound
in the two structures (Figure 9), revealing a similar pattern with a certain degree of flexibility
in the phytyl chains in comparison with the high rigidity in the localization
of the atoms of the chlorins. The phytyls in the L91P are slightly
more flexible, a trait that could also have concurred to the loss
of photoprotection of the chlorins.

Figure 9 Comparison between the structures of Lv-wt15 (panel A) and Lv-L91P26 (panel B), focused
on the B-factors of the atoms of the Chl molecules. The same view
is reported in the two panels, with the Chls a shown
in sticks.

An alternative explanation for
the dependence of the photostability
of the bound pigments to mutations of L91 would be that the different
amino acid side chains interact differently with 1O2. Since all amino acids investigated in this study have an
aliphatic side chain (or a hydrogen atom in the case of glycine),
their direct reaction with 1O2 can be excluded.
Moreover, the residues are too far away from the portion of the chlorin
ring involved in the reaction with 1O221,34−36 to be masking these parts of the chlorin ring toward 1O2 access. Therefore, we conclude that photoprotection
of the bound Chls in WSCP21 depends not
only on the presence of the phytyl chains but also on their correct
localization, enforced by the protein surrounding, within the two
adjacent Chl macrocycles in the open-sandwich dimer.

Conclusions
The biochemical and photophysical data described in this paper
highlight that both phytyl–phytyl and phytyl–protein
interactions in the WSCP core are involved in generating the unusual
photo- and heat stability of WSCP that characterize these plant proteins,
confirming that phytyl chains play a central role in the WSCP complex.
In particular, we have shown that the remarkable heat stability of
WSCP depends on the presence of its Chl phytyl chains that interact
with one another, with both chlorin rings in the open-sandwich dimer,
and with several amino acid side chains of neighboring protein subunits.

The photoprotection of Chls in WSCP relies anyway on the isoprenoids,
even in the absence of carotenoids, in the form of the phytyl chains.
The recently proposed phytyl-based photoprotective mechanism of WSCP
is not only dependent on the presence of the phytyl moiety but even
on its correct conformation. Amino acid exchanges in a single position
in the apoprotein affect the localization of phytyls with regard to
their chlorin rings, modifying the ability of phytyls to photoprotect
these pigments. These findings highlight how interactions between
Chl substructures and their protein environment determine the properties
of Chl–protein complexes.

Materials and Methods
Sample
Preparation
Mutagenesis and transformation of
DNA encoding Lv-wt (uniprot: O04797) and various single mutants (see Table S1) were performed as described before.26 Recombinant protein expression and purification
and its reconstitution with either Chls or Chlides was carried out
as previously described.26

Spectroscopy
UV–vis absorption spectra of WSCP
complexes in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8) were recorded between
750 and 250 nm in a quartz cuvette (10 mm path length) with a scan
speed of 200 nm min–1 and a bandwidth of 2 nm at
room temperature (RT) using a V-550 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Jasco).

Circular dichroism (CD) was measured with a J-810 spectropolarimeter
(Jasco) equipped with a Jasco CDF-426S peltier element for temperature
control. CD spectra of WSCP complexes in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH
7.8) were monitored at 23 °C. In the visible region (750–350
nm), the following parameters were adopted: 2 mm path length, data
pitch 1 nm, 100 nm min–1 scan speed, response time
4 s, 4× accumulation. In the UV region (300–180 nm), the
parameters were as follows: 0.5 mm path length, 0.5 nm data pitch,
50 nm min–1 scan speed, 4 s response time, and 9×
accumulation.

Steady-state fluorescence emission of WSCP complexes
in 20 mM sodium
phosphate (pH 7.8) was measured in a FluoroMax-2 instrument (Jobin
Yvon-Spex) at RT using a cuvette with the dimensions of 5 × 5
mm2 (slits 1 nm, increment 1 nm, integration time 1 s).
Emission was monitored between 650 and 850 nm with excitation at 410
nm (Chl a WSCP) and 430 nm (Chl b WSCP).
