A novel
quaternary cationic pillar[5]arene-modified zeolite (WPA5/zeolite)
was prepared via charge interaction between the cationic WPA5 and
natural zeolite and characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction,
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and thermogravimetric (TG)
analysis. The effects of zeolite particle size, WPA5 concentration,
adsorption time, initial concentration, and pH on the removal of methyl
orange (MO) were studied. The SEM and XRD results revealed a strong
interaction between WPA5 and natural zeolite, and the modified composites
showed novel microscopic morphology and structural properties. TG
analysis indicated excellent thermal stability of the composite. MO
was removed via electrostatic adsorption, and the removal efficiency
was 84% at an initial concentration of 100 mg/L. Increase in the initial
dye concentration enhanced the adsorption capacity of WPA5/zeolite
and decreased the removal of MO. Based on the adsorption kinetics,
the pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.998)
described the kinetic behavior of MO on WPA5/zeolite. In addition,
UV and fluorescence spectra revealed that MO and WPA5 are complexed
by a 1:1 complex ratio, and the binding constant between them was
12 595 L·mol–1. NMR and molecular docking
also verified their interaction. Therefore, the potential application
of the prepared composite includes removal of organic anionic dyes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
rapid growth of cosmetic, rubber, plastic, textile, and paper
industries has increased the severity of water and environmental pollution.1 Wastewater contaminated with organic dye is recognized
as one of the major sources of industrial pollution worldwide.2 Each year, 700 000 tons of dyes are consumed
by the textile industry. Therefore, untreated effluents discharged
by the printing and dyeing industry are one of the important causes
of water pollution.3 The composition of
printing and dyeing wastewater is complex and extremely toxic to the
ecosystem, and it is highly difficult to remove the organic dye molecules.4,5 Methyl orange (MO) (C14H14N3NaO3S; MO; Figure 1), an anionic azo dye, is carcinogenic and mutagenic, in addition
to triggering shock, increasing heart rate, inducing jaundice, vomiting,
and tissue necrosis.6−10 Treatment methods for dye removal from water include oxidation,
membrane separation, coagulation, adsorption, chemical reduction,
and biological treatment.11−13 Adsorption is economical and
effective because of its simplicity and high efficiency.14

Figure 1 Molecular structures of (a) WPA5, (b) MO dye, (c) zeolite,
and
the adsorption mechanism of MO using modified zeolite.

Natural zeolite has been widely used in the aqueous treatment
of
environmental contaminants because of its wide variety, abundant reserves,
low price, and simplicity of processing technology.15,16 Zeolite has a unique structure comprising an aluminosilicate skeleton
and abundant intracrystalline pores, resulting in strong ion exchange
and adsorption properties.17,18 However, zeolites exhibit
a permanent negative electrical structure due to isomorphous replacement,
which results in weak adsorption of organic anions. Therefore, modification
of natural zeolites has been attempted to address the issue.19,20

Macrocyclic compounds playing an increasingly important role
in
the treatment of Pillararene was initially discovered by Ogoshi in
2008.21 It has a tubular morphology compared
with other macrocyclic molecules such as crown ether,22 cyclodextrin,23−25calixarene,26,27 and cucurbituril.28 Pillararenes have
been widely used in gas adsorption,29,30 wastewater
treatment,31−33 drug transport,36−39 and molecular recognition40−43 due to their easy modification, simplicity of preparation, and optimal
performance.34,35

In this work, we report
the preparation and characterization of
water-soluble pillar[5]arene-modified zeolite (WPA5/zeolite). Subsequently,
the adsorption of modified zeolite on MO was studied (Figure 1). In addition, the effects
of zeolite particle size, initial dye concentration, adsorption time,
and pH on the adsorption process were investigated. To the best of
our knowledge, studies investigating WPA5/zeolite for MO dye removal
have yet to be reported. Therefore, the primary aim of this work is
the development of a novel method of zeolite modification, with potential
application in the field of water pollution treatment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SEM and Optical Microscopic
Analysis
The morphologies of WPA5, zeolite, and their composites
were investigated
via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2). The microstructure of WPA5 was characterized
by a planar structure with irregular lines. The natural zeolite exhibited
an uneven sheet-like structure, with clearly visible crevice lines
between the sheets. However, the WPA5/zeolite appeared as a large,
irregular, and spherical structure, and the original sulcus of natural
zeolite was filled. The WPA5/zeolite varied in size and shape with
WPA5 and natural zeolite, which confirmed the formation of novel composite
materials.

Figure 2 SEM images of (a) WPA5, (b) WPA5/zeolite, and (c) zeolite.

The morphologies of WPA5/zeolite and natural zeolite
after adsorption
of MO were determined using optical photomicroscopy (Figure 3). As shown in the figure,
the WPA5/zeolite was dyed deep orange after MO adsorption. However,
the permanent negative charge of natural zeolite resulted in an electrostatic
repulsion between the MO and the zeolite. Therefore, the natural zeolite
displayed a light orange color upon MO adsorption.

of natural zeolite and WPA5/zeolite
after MO adsorption.

2.2 FTIR
Analysis
Figure 4 shows the Fourier transform infrared absorption
spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of WPA5, zeolite, and their composite.
The peak at 474.00 cm–1 represents the bending vibration
of the Si–O bond, and the peak at 539.42 cm–1 denotes the telescopic vibration of the Si–O–Al. The
peak at 794.46 cm–1 indicates the bending vibration
of −OH on Si–OH, and the peak at 1098.84 cm–1 represents the stretching vibration of Si–O– in the
zeolite structure. The characteristic peak of −OH is observed
at 3433.87 cm–1, and the peak at 3619.86 cm–1 indicates stretching vibration generated by −OH
combined with Si. In addition, the peak at 1209.84 cm–1 in the spectrum of WPA5 suggests a telescopic vibration of the C–N
bond. The peak at 1404 cm–1 corresponds to the bending
vibration of CH3–N+, and the peak at
1484.36 cm–1 denotes shear vibration of the −CH2–N+ bond. The vibrations of CH3–N+ and −CH2–N+ in WPA5 are found in the FTIR spectrum of the modified zeolite but
not in the natural zeolite. Therefore, this phenomenon suggests successful
synthesis of WPA5-modified zeolite.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of (a) WPA5, (b) WPA5/zeolite,
and (c) zeolite.

2.3 XRD Analysis
Figure 5 displays
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of WPA5, zeolite, and the WPA5/zeolite composite. The XRD pattern
of WPA5 reveals its amorphous structure. The natural zeolite yields
major crystal diffraction peaks at 12.36°, 20.85°, 21.97°,
23.59°, 24.86°, 26.62°, 27.65°, 36.07°, 36.52°,
39.45°, 50.15°, and 59.93°. However, the significant
characteristic peaks of natural zeolite at 27.65° and 36.52°
were not observed in the WPA5/zeolite composite, and the major peaks
of zeolite were weakened in the composites, which indicated the strong
interaction between WPA5 and zeolite.

Figure 5 X-ray diffraction patterns of WPA5, WPA5/zeolite,
and zeolite.

2.4 SSNMR
Analysis
The formation of WPA5/zeolite
was further confirmed using 13C SSNMR analysis (Figure 6). The peaks located
between 10 and 70 ppm (α) were assigned as methyl (−CH3) and methylene (−CH2−) in WPA5 (Figure 6a), and the peaks
located between 110 and 210 ppm (β, γ) can be resolved
into the sp2 carbons of the phenyl rings in the WPA5. The
carbon peaks in WPA5 can be clearly found in the 13C SSNMR
spectrum of WPA5/zeolite (Figure 6b), and no carbon signal is detected in natural zeolite
(Figure 6c). These
phenomena strongly illustrate the successful preparation of WPA5-modified
zeolite.

and (c) zeolite. (d) 13C NMR characterization of WPA5.

2.5 TG Analysis
The
thermogravimetric
(TG) curves of WPA5, zeolite, and WPA5/zeolite are shown in Figure 7. The melting point
of WPA5 ranges from 271.2 to 271.8 °C, suggesting small amounts
of bound and free water in WPA5. A weight loss of 11.84 wt % occurred
initially when the temperature increased to 290 °C. A major weight
loss of WPA5 (64.88 wt %) in the region of 300–390 °C
suggested degradation. The final weight loss at 390–780 °C
(28.49 wt %) revealed the decomposition of WPA5. However, the entire
warming process had little effect on the weight loss (4.05%) of natural
zeolite. Notably, the total weight loss of the WPA5/zeolite was 8.89
wt %, indicating the loading of a specific WPA5 mass onto the zeolite.
In addition, TG analysis demonstrated that zeolite increased the thermal
stability of WPA5.

Figure 7 TG curves of WPA5, WPA5/zeolite, and zeolite.

2.6 Adsorption Study
2.6.1 Standard
Curve of MO
The standard
curve of MO is shown in Figure 8. It was calculated using the equation C =
(A + 0.02331)/0.07891, and it has a correlation coefficient
of R = 0.9999.

Figure 8 Standard curve of MO.

2.6.2 Effect of Zeolite Particle Size
The percent
removal of MO by zeolites and WPA5/zeolite of different
particle sizes is shown in Figure 9. The removal of MO by natural zeolite was very limited,
and the average removal efficiency was about 4%. The adsorption of
MO by natural zeolites was greatly improved after modification with
WPA5. Doping of WPA5 onto the surface and pores of the zeolite via
charge interaction resulted in a positive charge and facilitated the
removal of the anionic pollutant MO. When the particle size was reduced
from 10 to 30 mesh, the adsorption of MO by the WPA5/zeolite was continuously
increased to a maximum of 85% at 30 mesh. When the particle size was
decreased, the removal of MO by the WPA5/zeolite also declined. The
reduced particle size increased the specific surface area of the zeolite,
which provided additional ion exchange sites for the binding of WPA5
molecules to the zeolite. When the particle size was reduced, the
increased specific surface area of the zeolite provided additional
ion exchange sites, facilitating the binding of WPA5 molecules to
the zeolite. However, the decreased space was not conducive to WPA5
binding to the surface of the zeolite and thus the percent removal
of MO was reduced.

Figure 9 Effect of zeolite particle size on MO adsorption.

2.6.3 Effect of WPA5 Concentration
The
effect of different concentrations of WPA5-modified natural zeolite
(30 mesh) on the removal of MO is shown in Figure 10. The removal efficiency of MO by natural
zeolite was 4.4% and that of MO by WPA5/zeolite dissolved in 0.5 g/L
WPA5 solution was 16.2%. With the increased WPA5 concentration, the
percent removal of MO by WPA5/zeolite was also increased. When the
WPA5 concentration was 3.5 g/L, the removal of MO by the WPA5/zeolite
reached 81.4%. As the WPA5 concentration continued to increase, the
removal of MO by the modified zeolite tended to increase slowly, but
this increase was not significant. When the WPA5 concentration was
8.0 g/L, the removal of MO by the WPA5/zeolite reached 84.6%. Based
on the dosage of WPA5 and the percent removal of MO, the WPA5 solution
at a concentration of 8.0 g/L was selected to modify the zeolite in
a subsequent study.

Figure 10 Effect of different concentrations of WPA5 on the adsorption
of
the MO dye.

2.6.4 Effect
of Contact Time
The effect
of adsorption time on MO removal is shown in Figure 11. In general, as the adsorption time was
prolonged, the percent removal increased. The rapid adsorption from
0 to 150 min was partly attributed to insufficient internal diffusion
resistance and a substantial number of adsorption sites. When the
adsorption time increased to 150 min, the removal of MO by the modified
zeolite was 75.45%. After 150 min, the concentration of MO gradually
decreased, which led to a decrease in the concentration gradient between
the solution and the zeolite surface. Hence, the diffusion resistance
was increased, and the adsorption rate declined. The percent removal
of MO by the modified zeolite increased very slowly and reached 81.51%
in 960 min.

Figure 11 Effect of contact time on the adsorption of the MO dye.

2.6.5 Effect of Initial Concentration
The initial concentration of MO plays an important role in the
removal
of the contaminant by allowing the dye molecule to overcome the mass
transfer resistance generated from the aqueous to the solid phase.
As shown in Figure 12, different initial concentrations of MO solution affect the dye
removal and adsorption capacity. It is apparent from the figure that
the percent removal of MO by the modified zeolite decreases as the
initial concentration increases due to the decreased number of active
sites in the modified zeolite.

Figure 12 Effect of the initial dye concentration
on MO adsorption.

2.6.6 Effect
of pH
Solution pH is a meaningful
parameter in the adsorption of pollutants. It changes the efficiency
of MO adsorption by regulating the surface charge and dissociation
of the zeolite. The effect of pH on the removal of MO is shown in Figure 13. It is apparent
that the WPA5/zeolite showed an “M” shape for the percent
removal of MO in the pH range of 2–12 and reached a maximum
at pH 5. Subsequently, the percent removal declined to a minimum at
pH 7. However, as the pH increased from 7 to 9, the removal was enhanced
and reached a maximum at pH 9. However, as the pH continued to increase,
the surface of the WPA5/zeolite attracted OH– ions
more efficiently than MO with a large molecular structure. This factor
mainly contributed to the reduction of MO clearance by WPA5/zeolite
at a high pH.

Figure 13 Effect of pH on MO adsorption.

2.7 Adsorption Kinetics
Two kinetic models
(pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models) were used to study
the adsorption mechanism of modified zeolites. Pseudo-first-order
models have been widely used to study the adsorption behavior of solid/liquid
systems. The linear form of the model is represented by the following
equation 1  

In the above equation, the term qt (mg·g–1) denotes adsorption
capacity at time t, qe (mg·g–1) represents
adsorption capacity at equilibrium, and k1 (min–1) is the pseudo-first-order-rate constant.

The linear form of the pseudo-second-order model is represented
by the following formula 2  

The second-order-rate constant k2 and
the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe can be determined from the t/qt versus t curve.

The linear plots of pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order
models for MO adsorption by WPA5/zeolite are shown in Figure 14. The correlation coefficients
are listed in Table 1. The goodness of fit can be determined by fitting the linear regression
coefficient R of the straight line. In addition,
the degree of closeness between the adsorption capacity obtained via
comparison of qe,exp and qe,cal obtained experimentally can also be used as a basis
for the determination of the goodness of fit of the kinetic model.
The correlation coefficient R (0.966) of the pseudo-first-order
model was lower than that of the pseudo-second-order model, and there
was a large deviation between its theoretical adsorption capacity qe,cal (2.08) and the experimental adsorption
capacity qe,exp (4.04). The R2 value of the pseudo-second-order model was 0.996, and
the pseudo-second-order theoretical adsorption capacity qe,cal (3.88) was close to the experimental value. Therefore,
the pseudo-secondary-model is more efficient in describing the adsorption
behavior of MO on WPA5/zeolite.

WPA5/zeolite: (a) pseudo-first-order
model and (b) pseudo-second-order model.

2.8 Adsorption
Isotherm
Adsorption thermodynamics
studies are important in delineating the adsorbent–adsorbate
interactions and the design of adsorption systems. Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherms have been widely used because of fewer parameters and simplicity,
with a high degree of fitness to the adsorption behavior of solid–liquid
systems.

The Langmuir equation is expressed as follows 3  

The equation for the linear change of eq 3 is as follows 4  where qe is the
equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent (mg·g–1), Ce denotes the equilibrium concentration
of the adsorbate (mg·L–1), KL represents the Langmuir constant (L/mg), and qm refers to the maximum adsorption capacity
(mg·g–1).

The separation factor or equilibrium
parameter is expressed by
the following formula 5  

In the above equation, if RL >
1, the
isotherm nature is unfavorable; linear if RL = 1; favorable if 0 < RL < 1;
and irreversible if RL = 0.

The
Freundlich isotherm model is an empirical formula used for
the determination of multimolecular layer adsorption, which has a
certain degree of generality. The most common type of adsorption isotherm
equation is as follows 6  

The linearized form of the Freundlich
isotherm model is as follows 7  

Figure 15 illustrates
the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms for the adsorption of MO on
modified zeolites. The correlation coefficients are listed in Table 2. The correlation
coefficient of the Langmuir model (0.98) was greater than that of
the Freundlich model (0.968). The results show that the Langmuir model
can be used to describe the adsorption of MO on WPA5/zeolite more
effectively than the other model.

models for MO adsorption.

2.9 Analysis
of Interaction between WPA5 and MO
The UV spectrum titration
diagram of WPA5 and MO is shown in Figure 16a. Assuming a 1:1
stoichiometry for the MO/WPA5 inclusion complex, the inclusion complexation
of MO with WPA5 could be expressed by eq 8. Then, the stability constant (Ks) can be calculated from eq 9. We can obtain eq 10 from eq 9. Finally, Ks can be obtained from the
investigation of the sequential vary of absorption (ΔA) at WPA5 concentrations, by a nonlinear least squares
method according to the curve-fitting eq 10. 8   9   10  where
[MO/WPA5], [MO], [WPA5], [MO]0, and [WPA5]0 are
the equilibrium concentrations of the
MO/WPA5, MO, WPA5, and the original concentrations of MO and WAP5,
respectively (mM); ΔA indicates the change
in absorbance of WPA5 in the presence or absence of MO; and Δε
is the differential molar extinction coefficient of WPA5 in the absence
and presence of MO.

Figure 16 (a) Ultraviolet titration of the WPA5 and MO in water:
4 ×
10–5 mol·L–1 WPA5, 0.05–1
equiv of MO. (b) Fluorescence spectroscopy titration of the WPA5 and
MO in water: 2 × 10–5 mol·L–1 WPA5, 0.1–1.5 equiv of MO, 285 nm excitation wavelength,
slit = 5/5 nm. (c) Job’s plot for determining the stoichiometry
in the complex of the WPA5 and MO in water. (d) Variation of the absorption
of WPA5 upon addition of MO in water: 3 × 10–5 mol·L–1 MO, 0.2–3 equiv of WPA5.

We obtained the complex stability constant for
the MO/WPA5 via
a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting method. The stability constant Ks and Gibbs free energy ΔG of the inclusion complex of WPA5 and MO in the aqueous phase are
12 595 L·mol–1 (log Ks = 4.0995) and −23.403 kJ·mol–1, respectively. It can be seen from the inset in Figure 16a that there is a good linear
match between the experimental value and the theoretical value, which
shows the 1:1 stoichiometry of the MO/WAP5 inclusion complex.

As shown in Figure 16b, WPA5 has a fluorescence peak at 235 nm. With the addition of different
concentrations of MO, the fluorescence of WPA5 gradually decreases.
This indicates that the fluorescence properties of WPA5 are significantly
changed after complexing with MO. Furthermore, Job’s method
was employed to obtain the stoichiometry of MO and WPA5 via the fluorescence
spectroscopy. In Figure 16c, the value of the max mole fraction of MO in this work is
0.5, which strongly proves the formation of the MO/WPA5 inclusion
complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The molecular docking diagram
of WPA5 and MO is shown in Figure 17. MO ran through the cavity of the WP5A and was at
the geometric center of WPA5. Then, the entire MO molecule was encapsulated
by WP5A, at which time the MO molecule was docked on the inner wall
of WP5A, eventually forming an MO/WP5A coordination complex.

Figure 17 Optimal conformation
formed by docking MO to the cavity of WPA5.

1H NMR data confirmed the MO and WPA5 complexation in
water. As shown in Figure 18, after adding the equivalent amount of MO to WPA5, the signal
of the proton signal of the host and the guest exhibits a significant
shift or signal broadening effect. Thus, MO should be more deeply
incorporated into the macrocycle cavity of WAP5. Furthermore, the
2D NMR 1H–1H NOESY of the complexes confirms
host–guest complexation (Figure 19). The aromatic protons of MO (D, C, E)
have cross-peaks with H1, H3, and H4 of WPA5. The aromatic protons
of MO (B) have cross-peaks with H1 and H3 of WPA5. Thus, we can conclude
that the MO/WPA5 inclusion complex is formed.

MO (0.015 mol·L–1) +
WPA5 (0.015 mol·L–1); (c) WPA5 (0.015 mol·L–1).

Figure 19 2D NMR 1H–1H NOESY analysis of MO
with WPA5 in D2O. The concentrations of the host and the
guest are 0.015 mol·L–1.

The removal ability of pure WPA5 to MO is shown in Figure 16d. The UV absorption of MO
exhibits a blue shift and small decreases with the addition of WPA5.
However, the modified zeolite does not undergo a blue shift when adsorbing
MO, and the absorbance is remarkably lowered (Figure 11). In addition, WPA5 is water-soluble; it
does not remove the MO from the aqueous phase and does not achieve
the purpose of treating sewage. This experiment reveals the correctness
of the experimental scheme for the adsorption of MO by WPA5-modified
zeolite.

3 Conclusions
This
study focused on the development of a novel, environmentally
friendly WPA5/zeolite for the adsorption of MO from aqueous solutions.
The SEM, XRD, FTIR, and SSNMR characterizations indicated successful
adsorption of WPA5 on the surface of the zeolite. TG examinations
confirmed the thermal stability of the WPA5/zeolite. The effects of
zeolite particle size, WPA5 concentration, adsorption time, initial
concentration, and pH on the percent removal efficiency of MO were
also investigated. The kinetic and adsorption data indicated that
the adsorption of MO on the WPA5/zeolite could be best described using
linear forms of pseudo-second-order models. In addition, UV and fluorescence
spectroscopy, NMR, and molecular docking provided an in-depth analysis
of the mechanism by which WPA5 interacts with MO. The WPA5/zeolite
is a promising candidate for the removal of MO.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Natural zeolite was purchased
from Hengnuo Filter material Co. Ltd. (Henan Province, P.R. China).
MO, hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ether, paraformaldehyde, tetrabromomethane,
triphenylphosphine, boron trifluoride etherate (98%), and trimethylamine
(30%) were purchased from Shanghai Titan Technology Co. Ltd. All of
the reagents used were of analytical grade (A. R.). All of the aqueous
solutions were prepared using ultrapure water.

4.2 Synthesis
of WPA5
WPA5 was synthesized
as described in the Supporting Information (Figure 1).44 A solution of CBr4 (33.46 g, 100.90
mmol) in acetonitrile (250 mL) was added dropwise to the acetonitrile
(50 mL) of hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ether (10.0 g, 50.45 mmol)
and PPh3 (36.46 g, 100.90 mmol) under an atmosphere of
nitrogen and reacted at room temperature for 4 h to obtain compound 2 (82%). To a solution of compound 2 (3.24 g,
10.00 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (100 mL), paraformaldehyde (0.90
g, 30 mmol) was added under nitrogen atmosphere; this was followed
by the addition of BF3·OEt2 (1.39 mL, 10
mmol) to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 6 h, resulting in a green solution. After the solvent was concentrated
in vacuo, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica
gel with petroleum ether/dichloromethane (1:1 v/v) as the eluant to
yield compound 3 (40%) as white powder. Compound 3 (0.4813 g, 0.2865 mmol) and excessive trimethylamine (3.2
mL, 11.46 mmol) were added to ethanol (30 mL). The solution was refluxed
for 36 h. The solvent was concentrated in vacuo, and 10 mL of deionized
water was added. After filtration, a clear solution was obtained.
Finally, the water was concentrated in vacuo to yield compound 4 as a colorless solid (91%), with the following spectroscopic
features: 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ (ppm):
6.89 (s, 10H), 4.49 (s, 10H), 3.84 (s, 20H), 3.24 (s, 90H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, D2O) δ (ppm): 149.30, 129.89, 116.55,
64.91, 63.49, 54.13, 29.57.

4.3 Preparation of the WPA5/Zeolite
Composite
The zeolite was added to a WPA5 solution (10 mL
of WPA5 aqueous
solution per 1 g of zeolite). The mixture was shaken at room temperature
for 24 h; this was followed by filtration of the solution. The WPA5/zeolite
composite was repeatedly washed with ultrapure water (40 mL ×
3) and finally dried at 50 °C to constant weight.

4.4 Characterization
1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as the internal
standard. SSNMR data were recorded on JNM-ECZ600R. The absorbance
was measured using an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrometer. The
fluorescence data were recorded on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer.
The FTIR spectra were measured with a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer
using the KBr pellet. XRD patterns of powder samples were recorded
using a D/Max-3B diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 0.15406 nm, 100 mA, 40 kV). The scan rate was 5°/min, and the
range of 2θ = 0.02° varied between 3° and 80°.
The sample microstructure was analyzed using a FEL Quanta 200 scanning
electron microscope. Optical microscopy was performed using SOPTOP
CX40. TG measurements were conducted with NETZSCH STA 449F3 by increasing
the temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
in a dynamic nitrogen atmosphere.

100 mL containing 150 mg/L MO solution were configured accurately,
and the following volumes of MO solution were added to a 10 mL volumetric
flask: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 mL. After ensuring
a constant volume, the flasks were shaken. The absorbance was measured
at the maximum absorption wavelength (467 nm).

4.5.2 Effect of Zeolite Particle Size
The zeolite was divided
into different sizes, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mesh, using a standard sampling sieve. A 10
g/L WPA5 solution was added to the zeolite and shaken for 24 h; this
was followed by removal of the supernatant and washing with ultrapure
water. Finally, the zeolite was dried at 50 °C to obtain a constant
weight. Zeolite particles of different sizes and weighing 0.5 g each
were transferred to a 50 mL stoppered conical flask containing the
WPA5/zeolite mixture; this was followed by the addition of 25 mL of
the 100 mg/L MO solution and shaking at room temperature for 12 h.
After standing for 1 h, the UV absorption spectrum was measured, and
the concentrations of MO before and after adsorption were determined
from the standard curve of MO.

The adsorption amount (qe) and removal percentage (R) of the modified zeolite for MO were calculated using the following
equations 11   12  

4.5.3 Effect of WPA5 Concentration
A
series of WPA5 solutions with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 20
g/L (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5,
8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 g/L) were configured. The
zeolite was modified with different concentrations of WPA5. It was
washed repeatedly with ultrapure water and dried at 50 °C to
constant weight. Zeolite modified with different concentrations of
aromatic hydrocarbons was accurately weighed to 0.5 g in a 50 mL conical
flask. This was followed by the addition of 25 mL of the 100 mg/L
MO solution and shaking at room temperature for 12 h. The absorbance
was measured after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min.

4.5.4 Effect of Contact Time
A batch
of modified zeolite was prepared using 8 g/L of WPA5 solution and
30 mesh zeolite. About 0.5 g of zeolite was added into a 50 mL stoppered
conical flask and mixed with 25 mL of a 100 mg/L MO solution. The
mixture was oscillated at room temperature for different times (10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360,
420, 480, 540, 600, 660, 720, 780, 840, 900, and 960 min), and the
removal percentage of MO by the modified zeolite was calculated according
to the method described in Section 4.5.2.

4.5.5 Effect
of Initial Concentration
After configuring a series of concentrations
of MO solution (20,
40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 250, and 300 mg/L), the
adsorption experiments were conducted by the addition of 0.5 g of
modified zeolite.

4.5.6 Effect of pH
A specific concentration
of MO solution was obtained by adjusting the pH (2–12) of the
aqueous solutions using HCl and NaOH.

4.6 Interaction
between WPA5 and MO
4.6.1 Determination by UV and
Fluorescence Spectroscopy
An in-depth study of the host–guest
interaction between
WPA5 and MO helps us to understand the adsorption mechanism. To quantify
the complexation of the MO by WPA5, the stability constants of the
MO/WPA5 complexes formed in water were estimated by ultraviolet titration.
The concentration of WPA5 was held constant at 0.04 mM. Then, an appropriate
amount of MO was added, and the final concentrations varied from 0
to 0.04 mM (MO: 0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.012, 0.014,
0.016, 0.018, 0.02, 0.022, 0.024, 0.026, 0.028, 0.03, 0.032, 0.034,
0.036, 0.038, and 0.04 mM in water). In addition, the fluorescence
properties of the supramolecular system of MO with WPA5 were investigated
by fluorescence spectroscopy titration. The concentration of WPA5
was held constant at 0.02 mM. Then, an appropriate amount of MO was
added, and the final concentrations varied from 0 to 0.03 mM (MO:
0, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.012, 0.014, 0.016, 0.018, 0.02,
0.022, 0.024, 0.026, 0.028, and 0.03 mM in water). The spectral data
were recorded after waiting for 30 min. The UV spectroscopy measurements
were done in the 280–500 nm spectral range. For fluorescence
tests, the excitation wavelength was 285 nm. The excitation and emission
slits were set at 5/5 nm, respectively. All of the experiments were
carried out in triplicate.

4.6.2 Job’s Plot Measurements
A solution of WP5A and MO at a concentration of 0.02 mM was prepared
using water. First, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 0.5,
and 0 mL of the WP5A solution were taken and transferred to 5 mL volumetric
flasks. Then, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5 mL of
the MO solution were added to each vial of WP5A solution, making the
total volume of each vial 5 mL. After shaking, fluorescence spectra
were recorded at room temperature.

4.6.3 Pure
WPA5 for the MO Removal Capability
Test
We further tested the ability of pure WPA5 to remove
MO to verify the correctness of the MO removal scheme for WPA5-modified
zeolites. The concentration of MO was held constant at 0.03 mM. Then,
different equivalents of WPA5 were added (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0,
1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, and 3.0 equiv). The UV
spectral data were recorded after vortexing for 5 min and waiting
for 1 h.

4.6.4 Docking Calculation
Furthermore,
in order to clearly explain the formation mechanism of the MO/WP5A
complex, molecular docking calculations were performed. Docking MO
to the cavity of WP5A was based on the empirical free energy function
and the Lamarck genetic algorithm. WP5A acted as a rigid acceptor
molecule, while the MO acted as a ligand molecule allowing for flexible
twisting. The WP5A was set to a grid box size to 5.0 nm × 5.0
nm × 5.0 nm; the grid spacing was 0.375 nm. Then, we calculated
the grid points. The maximum evaluation number was 2.5 × 107, and the Lamarck genetic algorithm was used to perform 100
conformational searches. After the docking, the inclusion pattern
of the MO/WP5A complex was discussed by cluster analysis. Molecular
docking was performed on the AutoDock 4.2 program.45
