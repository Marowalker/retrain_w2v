A porous
and low-density protective film on a steel surface in
the corrosive environment can undergo deterioration even in the presence
of organic inhibitors due to infiltration of aggressive ions into
the pinholes and/or pores. This phenomenon is related to the localized
corrosion that takes place even in the presence of an optimal concentration
of organic corrosion inhibitors in the given medium. To overcome this
issue, we have designed an organic protective film on a steel surface
with the help of titania nanoparticles (TNPs) combined with an organic
corrosion inhibitor derived from Aganonerion polymorphum leaf extract (APLE), all to be studied in a simulated ethanol fuel
blend (SEFB). The TNPs with varied diameters and concentrations have
been studied for examining their effect on the inhibition capacity
of 1000 ppm APLE on the steel surface in SEFB medium using electrochemical
and surface analysis techniques. Enhanced corrosion inhibition of
the surficial film was observed in the presence of both the APLE inhibitor
and small amounts of TNPs. A direct agreement was observed between
the experimental and molecular dynamics theoretical investigations
showcasing high binding energy between inhibitor molecules and steel
substrates, resulting in a much higher adhesion of the protective
film, good thermal stability of the adsorbent film, and electron abundance
for the supply of steel substrate of inhibitor species.

1 Introduction
The
excessive use of fossil fuels, especially crude oil, leads
to many negative effects on the environment and human health. The
effects are not only limited to marine life and farmland but also
extends to forest and air environment.1−3 Therefore, it is the
need of the hour to replace fossil fuels with renewable energies such
as solar, wind, geothermal, tidal power, and biomass with biofuel
as the most feasible solution.4−6 Gasoline, the most widely used
fuel for industrial and civil activities, is a liquid-type product
of fossil fuels extracted through an oil refining process. Hence,
it is also highly advisable to be partly or fully replaced by biofuel
such as bioethanol. Unfortunately, due to technical and economic constraints,
there is a very small window of opportunity for fully replacing gasoline
by bioethanol. To overcome this, biogasoline, a mixture of traditional
gasoline and bioethanol has emerged to be an optimal solution.7 The volume percentage of bioethanol in biogasoline
is marketed as E-grade, with E10 (10% ethanol) as the most popular
biogasoline worldwide. Many governments have considered and adopted
E85 because of its performance as well as affordable cost.8−10 Despite many advantages of biogasoline, such as increasing engine
combustion efficiency, lowering driving cost, decreasing particulate
matter with sizes below 10 μm (PM10) that affects human health,
reducing greenhouse gas emission, and minimizing emissions of SOx and NOx gas that,
respectively, cause the global warming effect and acid rain, it does
have a massive drawback, that is, the corrosion on fuel tanks and
piping systems, which are mainly made of mild steel. The corrosion
of steel could be caused by the hygroscopic properties of ethanol,
aggressive contaminants in bioethanol, and bacteria in the blend.11 To overcome this drawback, many manufacturers
require supplement additives into biogasoline.12−15 In recent years, the most widely
used anticorrosive additives for gasoline are inhibitors including
high-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, long-chain aliphatic amines,
amine salts of carboxylic acids, and aliphatic polyamines and polyamides.16 These inhibitors have shown poor pitting corrosion
resistance and some of them even affect human health, but they are
still widely being used owing to the lack of good and environmentally
friendly inhibitors.17 For the above reasons,
it is necessary to look for alternative inhibitors for biogasoline
that possess high-performance, ecological safety and easiness of manufacture,
as well as high availability and economic viability. A new research
trend on inhibitors using plant-extracted compounds has high potential
in many corrosive environments such as H2SO4, HCl acidic conditions, chloride solutions, or biodiesel, and can
be witnessed with the high number of publications.18−21 Herein, for the first time, we
have shown the potential application of leaf extracts from Aganonerion polymorphum as an effective corrosion
inhibitor for steel in the biogasoline environment.

The above
leaf extract was studied due to its popularity in South
East Asian countries as a fresh vegetable with low-cost, as well as
due to its environmental friendliness. Currently, there is a lack
of research on exploring APL chemical composition, which would help
in better understanding the nature of this leaf, as well as extending
the scope for its application. Furthermore, there are very few reports
on unconventional APL applications such as a green corrosion inhibitor
for mild steel in an ethanol fuel blend. An earlier study11 indicated that the extracting process could
be simple and easy with inexpensive and nontoxic chemicals (ethanol
and ethyl acetate). Additionally, the solvents can be collected and
reused at the end of the process, which significantly reduces the
cost of production. Particularly, APL’s components could include
natural derivatives such as aromatic amines and long hydrocarbon chain
carboxylic acids and esters, which are in the commercial additive
group for biogasoline and are also green in concept and efficient
in cost. A. polymorphum leaf–ethyl
acetate extract was investigated in the simulated ethanol fuel blend
(SEFB) and was observed to inhibit steel corrosion.11 The results indicated that APLE showed its best performance
at 1000 ppm, and the inhibiting effect decreased with the increasing
inhibitor concentration beyond 1000 ppm. The good corrosion performance
was attributed to the protective film formation on the steel surface
due to the adsorption of inhibitor species as an organic barrier layer.
However, the main components that directly affected the corrosion
inhibition of steel have not been examined yet. Furthermore, porosity
including pores and pinholes is possible in the organic films, resulting
in a lower film density on the substrate surface.22 This could also result in delamination and localized corrosion
through these pores and/or pinholes due to localized penetration and
diffusion of the aggressive ions into the substrate forming a major
cathode and a minor anode, leading to corrosion.23 These are significantly related to localized corrosion
even at an optimal concentration of the organic corrosion inhibitors.
Overcoming these weaknesses of the organic inhibitors is very important
to enhance its performance. Also, using theoretical methods such as
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and/or quantum mechanics techniques
would provide insights and detailed understanding concerning electronic
and molecular properties to unravel the adsorption of inhibitor molecules
on active sites.

Nanoparticles have a large surface area, providing
strong diffusion
driving-force so that they can be assembled at the pores and/or pinholes
in the organic film by their diffusion ability.24,25 Among many types of nanoparticles, titanium dioxide nanoparticles
(TNPs) is an outstanding material due to their chemical, thermal,
and mechanical stabilities, as well as environmental friendliness
and easiness of fabrication.26 Their molecules
have one atom of titanium and two atoms of oxygen with very high surface
area which helps them to easily react with other molecules such as
those comprising carbon atoms in the organic film,27−29 suggesting
them to be ideal candidates for self-healing the defects on the organic
film to achieve a better barrier layer on the steel surface when organic
inhibitors are adopted. Therefore, this study focused on the film
formation process and mechanism of the protective layer on the steel
surface when APLE was used in conjugation with TNPs as a green corrosion
inhibitor, studied by experimental methods and molecular dynamics
simulation. TNPs were used as synergistic inhibitors given their reinforcing
ability in forming the protective layer on the steel surface. Particularly,
the corrosion inhibition effect of APLE was studied using theoretical
methods including density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, which provided detailed electronic and molecular
understandings regarding the adsorption of inhibitors on active sites
under experimental conditions. DFT simulation provided information
about inhibitor molecules that may affect its inhibiting properties,
such as electro- or nucleophilic sites and orbital distribution. In
addition, MD simulation also showcased the interaction between inhibitor
molecules and the steel surface under different conditions such as
temperature or pressure, including interaction energy, binding energy,
and thermodynamics properties. The simulation process could serve
as a platform for better understanding the interaction between the
adsorbent materials and the substrate surface and providing a correlation
with the experimental results.

2 Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine crystallinity and
phase component of materials. For TNPs XRD pattern in Figure 1a, Joint Committee on Powder
Diffraction Standards database was used to identify TiO2 crystalline peaks of anatase, brookite, and rutile phases (card
nos. 21-1272, 29-1360, and 21-1276). As seen in Figure 1a, there are three anatase peaks (A), no
brookite peak (B), and four rutile peaks (R) with the relatively high
intensity of the R(210) peak. Peak search parameters of the XRD pattern
were analyzed by PANalytical X’Pert Highscore Plus version
3.0.0. On the basis of the analyzed results, the TNPs average crystalline
size was determined by the Scherrer equation. The calculated average
sizes and weight fraction of TNPs related to Figure 1a are given in Table S1, the results show that they had similar anatase and rutile
phases (43 and 57%, respectively) with an average size of 9.7 nm (TNPs—10
nm), which was used for further studies. To make sure that the as-prepared
TNP (10 nm) powder has only anatase and rutile crystalline structures,
Raman spectroscopy was performed. According to the investigation of
Tompsett et al. on the Raman spectrum of TiO2,30,31 the Raman spectrum of the as-prepared TNPs in Figure 1b is in good agreement with the XRD result,
where only anatase and rutile oscillation modes were recorded. There
are four anatase (A) and one rutile (R) peaks in Figure 1b including, a very strong
peak of A-Eg at 150 cm–1, an A-B1g peak at 402 cm–1, an A-A1g peak
at 516 cm–1, an A-Eg peak at 639 cm–1, and a rutile complex peak (R*) assigned to phonon
scattering in the rutile phase at 250 cm–1. All
recognized peaks shifted to higher frequency in comparison to the
previous reports, which may be due to structural imperfections present
in TNPs.

pattern and (b) Raman spectroscopy.

The diameter of TNPs plays a crucial role in determining
their
functional ability as effective inhibitors with synergistic effects
in the presence of APLE in SEFB medium. To study the particle size
of TNPs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements
were undertaken, as shown in Figures 2 and S1. First, it is observed
from SEM images of TNPs (10, 20, and 30 nm) to have corresponding
average particle sizes of 11.4, 23.0, and 32.5 nm as shown in Figure S1. Second, the TEM image of TNPs (10
nm) (Figure 2a) shows
that the average particle size is about 10.5 nm. Third, DLS profiles
in Figure 2b point
out the average size of TNPs (10, 20, and 30 nm) as 10.5, 22.5, and
33.8 nm with the highest related proportion of 29.7, 13.2, and 14.5%,
respectively. SEM images and DLS result of TNPs are well matched,
confirming the sizes of the TNPs as 10, 20, and 30 nm.

Figure 2 (a) TEM image of TNPs
with 10 nm in diameter and (b) the DLS profile
of TNPs dissolved in ethanol.

To study the inhibitor effects, an immersion test was carried
out
and studied by SEM measurement for three specimens immersed in different
solutions, such as without inhibitor (Figure S2a), with 1000 ppm APLE (Figure S2b), and
with 1000 ppm APLE and 30 ppm of TNPs (10 nm) (Figure S2c). The results showcase significant change in samples’
surface for the uninhibited and inhibited conditions. Notably, the
specimen without protection in Figure S2a shows the discontinuous surface containing many large islands and
pinholes that can be attributed to rusting products after the corrosion
process. Besides, Figure S2b shows the
smoother surface containing some small islands and very few pitting
holes, it is obvious to see grinding traces on the surface allowing
a thin layer to form above the surface, that can be assigned to APLE.
In addition, there is no pitting hole or island on the steel surface
as well as there are more organic materials concentrated on the pitting
site than the surroundings as observed in Figure S2c, indicating that the APLE and TNP mixture acts synergistically
to show better performance as a selective inhibitor. To further understand
the composition of this thin barrier layer X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were carried out.

XPS analysis was employed
to investigate elemental compositions
on the steel surface after 24 h of immersion in SEFB solution without
and with APLE and nanoparticle additions as displayed in Figure 3. We investigated
surficial films under three immersion conditions including SEFB solution
without inhibitor, with 1000 ppm APLE, with 1000 ppm APLE and 30 ppm
TNPs, respectively. The wide range of XPS spectra (Figure 3a) exhibits higher Fe peaks,
lower C 1s, and O 1s peaks of samples in SEFB without inhibitor (uninhibited
conditions) compared to those with inhibitor. Besides, the appearance
of O 1s (another peak), N 1s, P 2p, and Ti 2p peaks in the inhibited
conditions is due to the presence of organic molecules in APLE and
TNPs, approving that the inhibitors were covalently linked to the
steel surface and mitigated corrosion reactions. The high-resolution
spectrum of Fe 2p (Figure 3b) shows strong peaks of rusting products (FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and FeOOH) in the uninhibited
conditions, whereas they are insignificantly observed in the inhibited
conditions. As observed in Figure 3c, the significantly high intensity of the C 1s peak
in the inhibited conditions can be contributed to the APLE addition,
whereas the lower C 1s peak of uninhibited conditions indicates the
presence of organic contamination from the SEFB environment. The high-resolution
spectrum of O 1s peaks in Figure 3e indicates that the products on the steel surface
included oxide (at 529.7 and 531.1 eV) and hydroxyl (at 532.3 and
533.7 eV) phases in the uninhibited conditions; they were observed
around 531.3, 532.6, and 534.2 eV for the specimen immersed in the
inhibited systems. The shifts in the peak position suggest the replacement
of the chemical bond from iron oxide states in the uninhibited conditions
by organic bonding states in the inhibited conditions. Besides, both
the Ti 2p peak in Figure 3d and the Ti–O peak at 531.6 eV in Figure 3e confirm the existence of
TNPs in the protective layer of APLE and TNP mixture conditions. The
XPS data thus showed that the inhibitors formed a film on the samples’
surface by creating a chemical bond to the steel substrate, protecting
the steel surface from the corrosive environment, thereby significantly
reducing the formation of rusting products.

Figure 3 (a) Survey scan spectra
and narrow scan spectra of (b) Fe 2p, (c)
C 1s, (d) Ti 2p, and (e) O 1s coverage of the steel surface were characterized
by XPS measurement.

To understand the electrochemical
reactions taking place on the
steel surface under different conditions, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. It is a modern, highly accurate
technique that is used to investigate the existence, character, and
formation of protective layers. It is also a useful method to not
only study the interface between the coating film and the substrate
but also understand the kinetics of the corrosion process. This method
is nondestructive towards the sample surface and does not alter the
erosion potential. Figure 4a shows Nyquist plots of samples in the blank solution and
in the inhibited solutions containing 1000 ppm APLE and 30 ppm TNPs
with average size variations. In addition, Nyquist plots of samples
in the inhibited solutions containing 1000 ppm APLE without and with
various 10 nm-sized TNPs concentrations are presented in Figure 4b. The clear observation
of each two-semicircle-shaped loop in Figure 4 indicates the deposition of the protective
layer. First semicircles (nature of coatings) show not much distinction,
in contrast to the marked distinctions in second semicircles (nature
of the double layer formed between the film and the steel substrate).
Equivalent circuit in Figure S3 was used
to fit the Nyquist plots and respective fitted data are listed in Table S2, where Rs is solution resistance, CPEpro is the constant phase
element of the protective film in inhibited conditions, Rpro is the resistance of the pores in the film (CPEpro and Rpro were replaced by CPErust and Rrust in uninhibited conditions),
CPEdl is the constant phase element of the double layer,
and Rct is the resistance of the charge
transfer between the protective film and the steel substrate, respectively.
In electrochemistry, a constant phase element (CPE) represents an
imperfect capacitor that has two quantities including Q and α, which represents the capacitive value and mathematical
coefficient between 0 and 1. If α = 0, the CPE presents pure
resistance properties; in the case of α = 1, the CPE presents
pure capacitor properties; and when α = 0.5, the CPE presents
half-capacitor and half-resistance properties.

Figure 4 Nyquist plots of steel
specimen immersion in solutions (a) without
inhibitor and with 1000 ppm APLE in a mixture with different diameters
of 30 ppm TNPs and (b) with 1000 ppm APLE in a mixture with different
concentrations of 10 nm TNPs.

EIS fitted results in Table S2 show
the gradual decrease in the electrical properties of the protective
film (represented by Rpro and Qpro) and the properties of the interaction between
the film and the substrate (represented by Rct and Qdl) with the gradual increase
in the TNP size. To be more specific, Rpro and Rct decrease whereas Qpro and Qdl increase with
the increase in the TNP diameter, besides, the α values as shown
in Table S2 decreased showing that their
films lose their insulation properties at bigger TNP size. EIS parameters
of the TNP (10 nm) sample are the best in the survey, as can be seen,
TNPs with 10 nm diameter is the most suitable synergistic conditions
in combination with APLE, hence, further studies were carried out
with TNPs (10 nm) to examine the influence of TNP concentrations.
In addition, for EIS fitting parameters in the case of 0 ppm (without
protection of inhibitors), the electrochemical properties of the deposited
layer including rusting products are very poor as well as the bonding
properties of this coating to the substrate are not good, in comparison
with 1000 ppm. As the concentration of TNP (10 nm) inhibitors increases
from 10 to 50 ppm, we observe the following, the properties of the
coating (characterized by Qpro, α1, and Rpro) and the double layer
(characterized by Qdl, α2, and Rct) increases if TNPs concentration
is below 30 ppm, reaches maximum at 30 ppm, and decreases if TNP concentrations
are above 30 ppm. All fitting data have low relative error (χ2 below 0.5), indicating very good fitting quality with the
proposed equivalent circuit. Therefore, EIS results elucidated that
the TNP’s diameter of 10 nm and a concentration of 30 ppm are
optimal parameters to act as a synergistic inhibitor in the presence
of APLE. The mechanism and characteristic parameters of corrosion
and inhibition were further studied through potentiodynamic polarization
(PD) measurement.

The potentiodynamic polarization method could
provide useful information
regarding the mechanism of corrosion as well as corrosion inhibition,
which can extrapolate diverse parameters that characterize the corrosion
process including corrosion potential, corrosion current density,
corrosion rate, inhibition efficiency, and polarization resistance.
We studied potentiodynamic polarization curves of carbon steel immersed
in SEFB composed of 1000 ppm APLE combined with 30 ppm TNPs with varied
particle diameter as shown in Figure 5a, whereas the Tafel plot of inhibited solutions containing
1000 ppm APLE without and with different concentrations of 10 nm TNPs
are displayed in Figure 5b. Table 1 lists Tafel
fitted parameters of samples in Figure 5, herein the polarization resistance, corrosion rate,
and inhibition efficiency were calculated using the formulas 1–3, respectively.32 The results for the
corrosion rate and inhibition efficiency as a function of TNP diameter
and concentration are shown in Figure S4. 1   2   3  To be more specific, in eq 1, Rp is the polarization
resistance in kΩ, icorr is the corrosion
current density in μA/cm2, βa and
βc are the anodic and cathodic Tafel constant in
mV; in eq 2, CR is the
corrosion rate in mm/y, k = 3.27 × 10–3 is a constant that specifies the units for the corrosion rate in
mm, d = 7.85 g/cm3 is the density of steel,
EW = 28.25 g/mol is the equivalent weight of steel, and A is the exposed area in cm2; in eq 3, IE (%) is inhibition efficiency, icorr0 and icorr are the corrosion current
density of the uninhibited system and inhibited systems in μA/cm2, respectively. The PD results displayed in Table 1 have good consistency with
EIS results in Table S2 with respect to
corrosion protective capability of APLE and TNPs. The mixture of APLE
and TNPs exhibits mixed inhibition characteristics as observed from
the change of both the slope of anodic and cathodic branches. The
slopes of both branches reach their lowest values for TNPs with 10
nm diameter and 30 ppm concentration. Besides, corrosion potentials
and corrosion current densities (Ecorr and icorr) of specimens increase with
increasing TNP size or concentration beyond 30 ppm. They also show
the decline when increasing TNP (10 nm) concentration from 0 to 30
ppm. It might be due to the considerable effect of the inhibitor layers
on the current flows. This showcases that the smaller the value of Ecorr and icorr are,
the greater the polarization resistance (Rp) of the layer is. Extrapolating results of Rp, IE, and CR in Table 1 and Figure S4 show that the maximum Rp value (64 kΩ), highest IE value (97%),
and minimum CR value (0.008 mmpy) are observed by using 10 nm sized
TNPs at 30 ppm concentration. Next, to explain APLE’s protective
mechanism in synergy with TNPs, few characterization methods were
carried out as explained in the below section.

Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) is a
widely applied method to probe the organic constituents derived from
plant extracts. The result of GC–MS of the as-prepared A. polymorphum leaf–ethyl acetate extract
against retention time is exhibited in Figure 6. Apparently, despite being tracked within
55 min, APLE can only be recorded at the final stages of the isolation
process from 32nd to 42nd min, whereas the equipped silica column
can more easily adapt low polarized compounds rather than high ones.
It means this green extract is of excellent compatibility with ethanol
blended gasoline. The peaks included eight primary signals and some
negligible signals. When compared with commercial spectroscopy library
NIST 2.0, the phytochemical structures were found to be consisting
of (1R)-1-cyclohexylethanamine, hexadecanoic acid
(HA), ethyl hexadecanoate (EH), (1S)-1-cyclohexylethanamine,
ethyl (9Z,12Z)-hexadeca-9,12-dienoate,
octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acid, propan-2-yl 16-methylheptadecanoate,
and ethyl (9E,12E,15E)-octadeca-9,12,15-trienoate. The correlation between the GC–MS
data with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) data of both the as-prepared
glue and steel surface after immersion, demonstrates the effective
participation of organic functional groups in inhibiting action. The
selected compounds, hexadecanoic acid and ethyl hexadecanoate, were
used to carry out simulation studies as they were recognized by the
NIST GC–MS Search 2.0 software with very high probability (approximately
70%), whereas the others had lower probability (below 30%). The obtained
results could help in understanding the electronic and adsorptive
characterization of the APLE inhibitor upon interaction with the steel
substrate. In addition, our previous research11 on the FT-IR spectrum of the as-prepared APLE revealed the existence
of the O–C=O groups, the C=O bond, the C–H
bending mode in the methyl group, and the aliphatic C–H group
that are very consistent with the GC–MS result. Therefore,
FT-IR results further confirmed two selected substances (hexadecanoic
acid and ethyl hexadecanoate) of APLE.

Ab initio simulation is a state-of-the-art approach to study
the
detailed molecular structures, their physical–chemical properties,
and the microscopic interactions between them at a microscale or nanoscale.
Correlating this with the experimental results can help us to understand
the nature of many processes that may not be possible otherwise. To
mimic the real environment of corrosion, previous reports33−39 suggested that MD simulation should be carried out in the presence
of all concerned species which will actually take part in corrosion
inhibition processes such as H2O, H3O+, inhibitor molecules, and the Fe surface. However, this study involves
a more complicated corrosion system that cannot be simulated. Therefore,
MD simulation was performed to understand the adsorption behavior
as well as the interaction between the two inhibitor molecules (hexadecanoic
acid and ethyl hexadecanoate) and the Fe(110) surface under the influence
of temperature (at 25 and 60 °C, equal to 298 and 333 K). These
molecules were analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate
their quantum chemical properties. In the DFT study of inhibitor molecules,40EHOMO and ELUMO are very important quantum chemical parameters.
According to the frontier molecular orbital theory, the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) is filled orbitals that have the ability
to give electrons to the metal (iron) surface and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) is empty orbitals of the inhibitor molecules
that have the ability to accept electrons from iron atoms. From Koopman’s
theorem, EHOMO and ELUMO are closely related to the ionization potential (I) and electron affinity (A), namely 4   5  Therefore, a gap between ELUMO and EHOMO is
defined
as the energy gap (ΔE), its physical meaning
is the stability index of a molecule, which means the smaller the
ΔE value, the higher the reactivity of the
molecule to absorb on iron surface is. ΔE is
calculated by 6  On the basis of the hard and soft acid and
base theory (HSAB), inhibitor molecules and iron atoms can be considered
as Lewis base and Lewis acid, relatively. Pearson extended HSAB theory
by giving global hardness quantity, herein, the global hardness (η)
represents the ability of an atom to resist charge transfer. Besides,
electronegativity (χ) is the inferred parameter to characterize
the ability of attracting electrons of an atom in a chemical bond
with another atom. η and χ are obtained by formulas 7 and 8. Using η and χ, the fraction of electron transfer from
inhibitor molecules to the iron surface (ΔN) is given by eq 9. 7   8   9  In recent years, the value of χFe in eq 9 has
been suggested to be replaced by work function (Φ) values41 but this has not been widely accepted as well
as there are many issues needing further discussion with this replacement.
Therefore, χFe = 7 eV and ηFe =
0 eV were chosen for eq 9 as suggested by various reports.42−44 Ju et al.45 showed that any positive value of ΔN below 3.6 indicated electron transfer from the inhibitor
molecule to the metal surface, on the other hand, negative values
of ΔN indicated electrons transfer from the
metal surface to the inhibitor molecule. The Fukui function is an
important parameter to the determined local selectivity of an inhibitor,
showing which part of the molecule tends to be more attractive to
electrons or ions. The electrophilic f(−)
or nucleophilic f(+) Fukui function represents the
changes in electron density of the molecules when they lose or gain
electrons, the higher values of f(−) or f(+) could reflect the higher ability to donate or accept
electrons.

Hexadecanoic acid (HA) and ethyl hexadecanoate (EH)
were considered
as the main component of APLE, they were first deposited onto the
steel substrate due to their inhibiting properties. When the porous
organic layer formation reached enough thickness, TNPs could be attracted
and entangled to the pores inside that layer, thereby filling the
pores and preventing aggressive materials to pass through the organic
layer. There are two separated interactions in the model which are,
first, the interaction between the organic layer and the iron surface
that directly effects the experimental results, and finally, the interaction
between HA and EH with TNPs, which is complicated and has an indirect
effect on the experimental results, consequently this type of interaction
can be ignored. DFT calculation was applied for hexadecanoic acid
(HA) and ethyl hexadecanoate (EH) molecules using the DMol3 module. Figure S5 shows the HOMO (a), LUMO (b), nucleophilic
(c), and electrophilic (d) distribution of geometry optimization of
HA and EH molecules. As can be observed, the molecules of both the
HOMO and LUMO as well as f(+) and f(−) are allocated around the carbonyl functional group. From Figure S5a,b, both the HOMO regions spread on
the xOy plane, whereas the LUMO
regions are both oriented to the Oz direction. In
contrast, Figure S5c,d revealed that both
nucleophilic sites oriented to the Oz direction,
whereas electrophilic sites are expanded to a direction on the xOy plane but only positioned at around
the oxygen atom in the C=O bond. As a result, it is expected
that HA and EH molecules prefer adsorbing on the Fe(110) surface by
the xOy plane; hence, the adsorption
configuration of inhibitors on the Fe(110) surface are set horizontally.
Other simulation parameters are presented in Table 2a. Both HA and EH having positive ΔN values indicate that electrons have transferred from inhibitor
molecules to the Fe(110) surface and reduced the formation of iron
ions. In comparison with HA, EH has higher EHOMO, lower ELUMO and η,
whereas other parameters are almost the same, suggesting EH to donate
electrons to the Fe(110) surface. Additionally, EH has a ΔN value (0.552) higher than HA’s (0.520). From the
above, it can be interpreted that EH could be a better inhibitor than
HA.

To determine the absorption configuration
in MD simulation, two
simulation boxes were created, one contained a 12 × 9 supercell
of Fe(110) and a hexadecanoic acid molecule with a size of 34.40 ×
36.48 × 41.44 Å3, the other contained a 13 ×
10 supercell of Fe(110) and an ethyl hexadecanoate molecule with a
size of 37.26 × 40.54 × 44.77 Å3. Before
thermodynamics calculation, each structure in the simulation boxes
performed geometry optimization to find appropriate sites as well
as spatial orientations of the molecules above the steel surface.
The optimization process eliminated unreasonable configurations, resulting
in more reliable subsequent calculations. After thermodynamics calculation,
the total energy of configurations was obtained, whereas binding energy
between the inhibitor molecules and the Fe(110) surface were calculated
by 10   11  In eq 10, Esurface, Einhibitor, and E(surface+inhibitor) are the total energy of, Fe(110) supercell, HA and EH molecules,
and simulation boxes that contain Fe(110) supercell plus inhibitor
molecules, respectively. In eq 11, Eint is the interaction energy, Ebind is the binding energy between the inhibitor
molecules and the Fe(110) surface. Adsorption equilibrium configuration
of HA and EH on the Fe(110) surface at 25 and 60 °C are presented
in Figure 7, whereas
calculated binding energies are listed in Table 2b. Figure 7 shows both HA and EH at their most stable (lowest
energy) configuration as well as at the Fe(110) surface after the
simulation process, which indicates that they have good adhesion to
the steel substrate. In combination with the binding energy of HA
and EH from Table 2b, we can observe that both HA and EH have high binding energy to
the Fe(110) surface, and the binding energy of EH is higher than HA,
resulting in better adhesion to the steel substrate, that are consistent
with the previous prediction. In addition, the increases in total
energies of both HA and EH from Table 2b with increasing temperature show that the adsorption
of these inhibitors to the steel substrate is an endothermic process,
indicating that the adsorption of HA and EH on steel substrates could
be attributed to chemisorption. Because of the changes of total energies
with temperature (1 kcal/mol of HA and 2 kcal/mol of EH per 35 °C),
it can be concluded that HA and EH are very stable inhibitors for
the steel substrate, indeed, by using energy to heat conversion (the
change of 1 kcal/mol is equivalent to the change of 503 K), from the
change of total energy by temperature as above, we can estimate that
the adsorbent films are stable up to 563 °C for HA and 1063 °C
for EH.

Two organic compounds present in APLE are hexadecanoic acid
(HA)
and ethyl hexadecanoate (EH), they are considered to be the main component
in APLE. They adsorb onto the steel surface and form a protective
layer having a complex structure (long and hydrophobic hydrocarbon
chains) with a mesoporous network (porous structures with pore sizes
of about tens of nanometer). These pores allow passage of corrosive
agents from SEFB to penetrate through the film via the grain boundary
(channel) formed by imperfections in the steel structure. These corrosive
agents can easily access and attack the steel surface, resulting in
the reduction of protection effectiveness. With the low APLE concentration
(100 ppm), inhibitors bind to the steel surface in the form of discrete
distribution clusters with rusting products and cannot fully cover
the surface. With the higher APLE concentration (500 ppm), the coating
can cover the steel substrate surface completely, but the material
density was still low with the large size of channels and pores. When
the APLE concentration reached 1000 ppm, the material density in the
film became sufficient to minimize the number as well as the size
of channels and pores, leading to a maximum protective effect.11 However, the coating was thicker and the disorder
in the structure increased when adding inhibitor concentrations beyond
1000 ppm, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of small size
channels and pores that reduce protection. The protective mechanism
of TNPs in a mixture with APLE indicated that the optimized size (10
nm) and concentration (30 ppm) of TNPs with the appropriate size (10
nm of diameter) and concentration (30 ppm) effectively filled the
pores and channels in the APLE’s network to curb the penetration
of corrosive agents from SEFB into the coating structure, thereby
increasing the protective effect. In the case of larger TNP size (20
and 30 nm), the incompatibility of the TNP size with the pores and
channels in the film structure, unfortunately, led to the breakdown
in continuity of the coating, creating many secondary channels and
pores of large sizes, resulting in the decrease in the protective
effect. In the case of low concentrations of TNPs (10 and 20 ppm),
the amount of TNPs was not sufficient to fill the pores. At small
sizes, they can easily diffuse from the interior pores to surface
coating due to concentration difference. In addition, the corrosive
agents from SEFB migrated from the surface to interior pores following
TNPs’ pathways. With high concentrations of TNPs (40 and 50
ppm), high density of TNPs reduced the density of APLE in the film;
as a result, the coating became more porous with the expanded pores
and channels, allowing corrosive agents from SEFB to penetrate more
easily to the coating. All of the above-mentioned protection mechanisms
of APLE and APLE–TNPs mixture is summarized and illustrated
in Figure 8. Finally,
this work has shown that TNPs with 10 nm of diameter and 30 ppm of
concentration mixed with 1000 ppm APLE inhibitor have improved properties
to form a protective layer, which greatly enhanced the protective
effect of the composite film in the SEFB environment, thereby showcasing
the characteristics of a synergistic inhibitor for improving the steel
corrosion resistance.

3 Conclusions
A new
approach for corrosion protection suggested in the present
work proposes the self-healing ability of TNPs for blocking the defects
in an organic protective film formed on the metal surface along with
the use of organic corrosion inhibitors. Controllable inhibition efficiency
of steel was successfully gained via incorporation of TNPs and APLE
as synergistic inhibitors in the SEFB medium. The TNPs were incorporated
with APLE molecules to form the protective film that acted as a heat
stable barrier layer on the steel surface, resulting in improved corrosion
resistance as confirmed by DFT and MD simulation. Smaller nanosized
titania with an optimal concentration served as the better corrosion
inhibitor for steel in the investigated solution due to its ease of
passing through the defects on the protective film. These phenomena
resulted in significant reduction of corrosion current densities and
enhanced surface resistances of steel after immersion in investigated
solution. In addition, the study also indicated that the nanoparticles
with the synergistic inhibition properties are very important in defect
filling ability for corrosion protection of metals. It could create
a new approach to fight the drawback of organic corrosion inhibitors,
suggesting an expansion of the next generation of corrosion protection
systems.

4 Materials and methods
APLE was produced
by the Soxhlet extraction process, the detailed
process was presented in the previous report.11 In short, fresh A. polymorphum leaves
were dried at 60 °C, triturated to powder, and was added to a
Soxhlet extractor containing ethyl acetate, and then extracted at
75 °C for 24 h. In the following step, the extract (APLE) was
filtered, concentrated, and stored in a dry cabinet at room temperature.
The extracted product was analyzed by an attenuated total reflectance
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy apparatus (α-FT-IR spectrometer),
coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS)
(Agilent 7890B for GC and Agilent 5977A for MS). The GC–MS
probe was equipped with a silica column (30 m of length, 0.25 mm of
diameter) with the mobile phase flow rate of 1 mL/min, under helium
as the carrier gas and split ratio of 10:1. The injector temperature
and detector temperature were 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The
oven temperature settings were conducted at 60 °C, elevated to
220 °C with a step of 4 °C/min. The results of MS spectra
were compared with NIST 2.0 Library to identify the chemical structures
of the detected compounds of APLE.

TNPs were synthesized by
a sol–gel process using tetraisopropyl
orthotitanate (TTIP), the entire process was conducted in a glove
box containing dry nitrogen at ambient room temperature. All chemicals
used in the experiment were of reagent grade, purchased from MERCK
Singapore and used directly without further purification. First, 15.00
mL of TTIP (minimum purity 98%) was mixed with 34.15 mL of isopropyl
alcohol (IPA, minimum purity 99.8%) and 0.19 mL of diethanolamine
(DEA, minimum purity 99.5%) by magnetic stirring at 500 rpm for 4
h, to form 1.0 M precursor solution with a molar ratio of TTIP/DEA
being 1:1. Second, 0.07 mL of deionized water (passed ASTM D119346) and 14.01 mL of IPA was stirred at 500 rpm
for 4 h for hydrolysis. Third, the first solution was added dropwise
to the second solution and simultaneously stirred at 1200 rpm using
a magnetic stirrer until the molar ratio of the reactant TTIP/DEA/H2O/IPA (1:1:4:100) was attained. Finally, TNPs in powder form
was washed several times with deionized water to remove any residuals
after the synthesis, then dried in a vacuum cabinet, and carefully
mashed before using for further characterization. Steel was fabricated,
wired and molded by epoxy resin, and finally ground by 2000 grit silicon
carbide paper before measuring.

The corrosive medium, simulated
ethanol fuel blend (SEFB), was
prepared in accordance with ASTM D7577 rating no. 5,47 containing chemical contents as given in Table S3. In this research, the commercial unleaded gasoline
RON92 was used instead of Fuel C. The environments used for this study
were SEFB without inhibitor, with 1000 ppm APLE, with 1000 ppm APLE
in a mixture with 30 ppm TNPs of different diameters, and with 1000
ppm APLE in a mixture with different concentrations of TNPs of 10
nm in diameter. To prepare the APLE–TNP mixtures, 100 mL SEFB
and an appropriate amount of APLE and TNPs were added into closed
beakers and magnetically stirred at 900 rpm at 38 °C for 1 h,
and then stabilized for 15 min before employing the immersion process
in which the steel samples were introduced into the prepared beakers
with their metal faces (10 × 10 mm2 of exposed area)
downward. The immersion test lasted 24 h in a closed cabinet. The
electrochemical measurements were followed right after the immersion
test without any interference in testing solutions.

Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic
polarization (PD) measurements were performed by the VSP Potentiostat
instruments. The measurements were taken in the three-electrode electrochemical
cell that contains two platinum meshes as the counter electrode, the
silver/silver chloride as the reference electrode, and steel samples
as the working electrode. In EIS measurement, the peak-to-peak amplitude
of the sinusoidal perturbation was 10 mV and the frequency varied
from 100 kHz to 10 mHz. The PD measurement was undertaken immediately
after finishing EIS, with a scan range from −0.250 V vs an
open circuit voltage (EOCP) to +0.800
V vs VAg/AgCl and a scan rate of 0.166 mV/s. The EIS, PD
data and related fitting parameters were processed by integrated EC-Lab
software version 10.36.

The steel components were determined
by optical emission spectroscopy
as given in Table 3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of TNP powder was examined by Panalytical
X’Pert Pro materials research diffractometers. The Raman spectra
of TNP powder was recorded in a Horiba Jobin Yvon–Raman Spectrometer.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of TNPs and steel sample
surface after 24 h of immersion test were studied by a Hitachi S-4800
field emission scanning electron microscope. The transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of TNPs powder was inspected by a JEOL JEM-1400
flash transmission electron microscope. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
profile was analyzed by a dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer
LB-550-Horiba system. The XPS data of the immersion samples in SEFB
without and with inhibitor were dissected by the AES-XPS ESCA-2000
system.

In this research, an ab initio
approach was applied to study the
interaction between inhibitor molecules and steel substrates. Inhibitor
molecules were geometrically optimized in the DMol3 module with the
following settings: Becke’s 3 parameter exchange Lee Yang and
Parr correlation functional (B3LYP), DFT semi-core pseudopotentials
core treatment, DNP basis set with basis file 3.5 for an electronic
structure, population analysis containing Mulliken orbitals and charge
analysis along with Hirshfeld quadrupole analysis, energy and force
convergence tolerance were set as 1.0 × 10–5 Ha and 0.002 Ha/Å. Energy calculations were based on optimized
structures and respective electronic parameters consisting of the
highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO), energy gap (ΔE), global hardness (η), electronegativity (χ), the fraction
of transferred electron (ΔN), and Fukui functions.
Besides, the Fe crystal was geometrically optimized in a CASTEP module
with generalized gradient approximation, Perdew–Wang 1991 (PW91)
exchange–correlation, OTFG ultrasoft pseudopotentials, Koelling–Harmon
relativistic treatment, and energy and force convergence tolerance
were set as 5.0 × 10–6 eV/atom and 0.01 eV/Å.
After optimizing the Fe structure, the Fe(110) surface containing
five atom layers was built for the adsorption simulation process,
The Fe(110) lattice was chosen because of its popularity in nature,
whereas five iron atom layers was chosen to avoid the influence of
periodic lattice image on inhibitor molecules. The Fe(110) and inhibitor
molecules interaction were carried out by molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation in the Forcite module with ultra-fine quality, appropriate
boxes with periodic boundary conditions were applied for each inhibitor
molecule. During the optimization process, the first and last layer
in the Fe(110) surface are constrained and the condensed phase optimized
molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies forcefield were
taken into calculation. The MD simulation was performed at 25 °C
(298 K) and 60 °C (333 K) under canonical ensemble (NVT) using
a time step of 1.0 fs within the total simulation time of 2000 ps.
All simulation processes were performed using the BIOVIA Materials
Studio package.
