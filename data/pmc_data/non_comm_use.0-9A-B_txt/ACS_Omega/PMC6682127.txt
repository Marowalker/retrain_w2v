Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2,
Pt(NH3)4(Ac)2, (NH4)2PtCl4, and H2PtCl6 were used
to prepare Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts to investigate the effect of Pt precursors
on the hydroisomerization of n-dodecane. The catalyst
derived from Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 displays the best hydroisomerization activity and selectivity among
these precursors. The hydroisomerization conversion of n-dodecane is affected by the platinum particle size, platinum dispersion,
the location of platinum, and the valence state of platinum. The selectivity
of n-dodecane is determined by the number of Brønsted
acid sites and Pt crystal planes. These conclusions are verified by
combining transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction, NH3-temperature programmed desorption, and Py-IR studies. The
catalyst prepared with Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 as the precursor exhibits the smallest platinum particle
size and the highest platinum dispersion. Most of the platinum particles
are supported on the external surface of SAPO-11 with the Pt(111)
crystal face. Such a catalyst also possesses a suitable number of
Brønsted acid sites and then displays the best catalytic performance.
Obviously, the use of various precursors for the Pt-based catalyst
can significantly affect the performance of Pt/SAPO-11 for the hydroisomerization
of n-dodecane.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As the population of high-performance
engines used in the industrial production and the strengthening of
environmental protection requirements, the demand for high-grade lubricants
with low viscosity, low freezing point, and high index of the viscosity
is increasing.1 Although the long chain n-alkanes (i.e., wax) in the lubricating oil with high viscosity
index, their inferior fluidity at low-temperatures is a drawback.
Therefore, the wax must be partially or completely removed to give
a good fluidity lubricant at low temperatures.2

Isomerization dewaxing technology is derived from catalytic
dewaxing technology, which could convert the long chain n-alkanes into isoparaffins with side chains by hydroisomerization.3,4 This isomerization dewaxing technology is an ideal solution for
producing high-grade lubricants, and the core of the isomerization
dewaxing technology is the development of the catalysts.5−7

Metal/acid bifunctional
catalysts for alkane isomerization reactions have been studied extensively,
such as Pt, Ni, and other metals loaded on molecular sieves.8−12 The metals provide hydrogenation and dehydrogenation
active centers, while the molecular sieves supply acidic centers.
The key to make this combination become an excellent catalyst to achieve
the above goal is to balance the acidic and the metallic properties
of the catalysts.13−15

For the metal/acid bifunctional catalysts, the frequently used acid
supports are ZSM series and SAPO-like molecular sieves, such as ZSM-5,16 ZSM-12,17 and ZSM-22,18 and SAPO-11,19 SAPO-31,20 and SAPO-41.21 As
the representative of SAPO-like molecular sieves, SAPO-11 has been
widely considered as a support because of its unique pore structure,
especially its excellent catalytic performance in the long-chain alkanes
hydroisomerization reactions.3,22

Summarizing the
relevant literature, it can be seen that platinum is the most commonly
used active component for the hydroisomerization of n-alkanes, and 0.5 wt % Pt loading can generally provide sufficient
(de)hydrogenation activity sites.23,24 Moreover, the
incipient wetness impregnation method makes the catalysts perform
higher isomerization activity and selectivity as most of the platinum
particles could distributed on the external surface of the support.25 However, as there are many different Pt precursors,
such as H2PtCl6,26 Pt(NH3)4Cl2,27 Pt(NH3)4(OH)2,28 Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2,29 Pt(NO3)230 etc., the performance of the
platinum catalysts could be various when different precursors are
applied according to the reported literature. Aristizábal31 et al. used Pt–Ag/AC catalysts for the
catalytic reduction of nitrates, they found that the metal precursors
and the metal loading could significantly affect the catalytic performance.
Wang32 et al. revealed that the three catalysts
using Pt(NO3)2, Pt(NH3)4Cl2, and H2PtCl6 as platinum precursors,
respectively, behaved very different catalytic performance for n-hexadecane hydroisomerization. The catalyst derived from
H2PtCl6 exhibits better isomerization activity
and selectivity. The results could be attributed to the fact that
H2PtCl6 as the Pt precursor was more favorable
for dispersing Pt and increased the density of the active metal sites.
However, Regalbuto33 et al. reported that
Pt(NH3)42+ as the Pt precursor could
effectively inhibit the agglomeration of Pt particles and increase
the dispersion of the metal platinum, while (PtCl6)2– formed larger platinum particles. Whatever the conclusions
in the literature, different precursors of Pt could result in various
Pt-molecular sieve catalysts for hydroisomerization.

Considering
that different Pt precursors does have a significant effect on the
performance of the catalysts in the hydroisomerization of n-alkanes, Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts were prepared with Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, Pt(NH3)4(Ac)2, (NH4)2PtCl4, and H2PtCl6 as the metal precursors,
a self-made SAPO-11 molecular sieve as the support. The catalytic
performance of Pt/SAPO-11 prepared with different Pt precursors were
investigated in the n-dodecane hydroisomerization
here. The texture properties, the surface metal/acid functions, and
the impact of the precursors on the performance of the catalysts were
studied and characterized using various techniques.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Phase Structure of Catalysts
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts synthesized
with different platinum precursors were displayed in Figure 1. The diffraction peaks for
the samples located at 2θ = 9.84, 12.78, 16.10, 21.93, 22.49,
25.78, and 29.68° attributed to the typical SAPO-11 phase.34 However, it could be seen that the intensity
of these peaks decreased in the order of SAPO-11 > Pt–Cl
> Pt–NCl > Pt–C > Pt–N. This reveals
that the addition of Pt destroyed the crystallinity of the molecular
sieves to a certain extent, that is, the process of impregnating platinum
had effects on the basic structure of the support. Moreover, no platinum
diffraction peaks could be detected, which may be due to the 0.5 wt
% platinum loading was lower than the detection limit of the XRD technique.

2.2 Textural Properties
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples
were showed in Figure 2. When the relative pressure P/P0 < 0.02, there was a typical microporous adsorption.
As the P/P0 > 0.7,
a hysteresis loop appeared in the isotherms, which indicates that
the presence of the mesopores in the samples. It can be seen that
the support of SAPO-11 displayed the largest amount of adsorption
capacity, while the adsorption capacity of all Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts
decreased. This is the expected result as platinum particles blocked
part of the pores of the catalysts, accordingly Pt/SAPO-11 with H2PtCl6 as the precursor showed the minimum amount
of adsorption. Figure 3 displayed the pore size distributions of the catalysts. It was clear
that there were a small number of micropores in the catalysts but
mainly with mesopores. The calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area, pore volume, t-plot
micro-pore volume, and average pore diameter were listed in Table 1 for the catalysts.

2.3 Morphology
In order to further investigate the effect of the platinum particle
size and platinum crystal face on the hydroisomerization of the catalysts,
Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).
From Figure 4, it could
be seen that Pt metal particles were uniformly dispersed on the support.
Pt–N and Pt–C showed the same Pt(II) valence in the
precursors and smaller platinum particle size. For the catalyst of
Pt–NCl, Pt2+ and NH4+ formed
complex compounds and presented the largest platinum particle size.
The order of the platinum particle size from big to small was Pt–NCl
> Pt–Cl > Pt–C > Pt–N, and Pt–N
exhibited the smallest Pt particle size, which was 1.78 nm. The HRTEM
of the catalysts were also illustrated in Figure 4. It was found that the lattice fringe spacing
of Pt–N and Pt–C were 0.223 and 0.226 nm, respectively,
corresponding to the Pt(111) face, while Pt–NCl and Pt–Cl
exposed mainly the Pt(100) face.32,35 Moreover, the
size of platinum particles and the crystal planes of platinum may
affect the performance of the catalysts for hydroisomerization.

and corresponding particle distribution: (a,e,i) Pt–N, (b,f,j)

2.4 Hydrogen Temperature
Programmed Reduction and CO Chemisorption Characterization
Figure 5 illustrated
the hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
profiles of the samples. It can be seen that the peaks centered around
130 °C for all the samples can be attributed to the reduction
of Pt2+(Pt–NCl, Pt–C, Pt–N) or Pt4+(Pt–Cl), which are loaded on the external surface
of the support. The peaks among 320–365 °C could be seen
as the reduction of platinum in the internal pores.36 Because of a strong metal-support interaction, the peaks
appeared at 424 °C for Pt–NCl and 447 °C for Pt–C
reveals that some platinum species in the catalysts are difficult
to reduce.37 Moreover, both Pt–Cl
and Pt–N catalysts exhibited large low temperature reduction
peaks, indicating that a large number of platinum species were supported
on the external surface of the molecular sieves.

Figure 5 H2-TPR profiles of Pt/SAPO-11 with different
Pt precursors.

CO chemisorption
was employed to study the dispersion of platinum particles for Pt/SAPO-11
catalysts and the results were listed in Table 2. The Pt–N catalyst showed the highest
metal dispersion, which was up to 77%, followed by the Pt–C
catalyst. Their higher metal dispersion was consistent with the smaller
platinum particles (Figure 4). For the Pt–Cl catalyst, platinum species may be
more likely to agglomerate although the platinum species were easily
to be reduced on the external surface of the support, resulting in
a lower dispersion. Pt–NCl behaved as the lowest metal dispersion,
which was related to its large metal particle size (∼2.74 nm)
as well as lots of platinum particles in the pores of the support.

Pt Precursors
catalysts	particle size of Pt (nm)	Pt dispersion (%)	
Pt–N	1.78	77	
Pt–C	1.88	72	
Pt–Cl	1.94	41	
Pt–NCl	2.74	38	
In the light of both Pt–N and Pt–C having amine groups
in the platinum precursors, research studies revealed that the amine
groups would intend to decompose to NH3 in the calcination
process, and small platinum particles will be formed by the reduction
of Pt(II) in the presence of NH3. However, the platinum
particles are prone to agglomerate if the autoreduction processes
were too fast or at too high temperatures.32,38 In
our research, the catalysts prepared from Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Pt(NH3)4(Ac)2 had a higher platinum dispersion and smaller platinum particle
size. We considered that autoreduction of Pt2+ by NH3 might happen during the calcination process and the platinum
particles would intend to be formed. However, as there are nitrate
and acetate in the platinum precursors, it is possible that they would
have effects on the dispersion of platinum and the size of platinum
particles.

2.5 Acidic
Properties
NH3-temperature programmed desorption
(NH3-TPD) profiles of the samples were shown in Figure 6. It was clear that
two desorption peaks could be seen in all the samples, and the peaks
centered at around 160 and 270 °C correspond to weak and medium
acid sites, respectively.39

Figure 6 NH3-TPD profiles of Pt/SAPO-11 with
different Pt precursors.

Figure 7 exhibited the Py-IR
spectra of the samples after desorption at 300 °C. The IR spectra
peaks at 1450 and 1540 cm–1 can be assigned to the
pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites and Brønsted acid sites,
respectively, while the band at 1490 cm–1 was related
to the pyridine molecule adsorbed on both Lewis and Brønsted
acid sites.40 The number of the acid sites
for the catalysts were showed in Table 3. The number of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites
of Pt–N, Pt–C and Pt–NCl decreased compared to
SAPO-11, Pt–Cl increased on the other hand. This could be attributed
to the Cl residues in the Pt–Cl catalyst. Platinum was supposed
to have been modified over the acidity of the support by covering
the acid sites. In summary, an effective catalyst for the hydroisomerization
of n-alkanes requires a suitable number of Brønsted
acid sites.

2.6 Catalytic
Performance
The hydroisomerization of n-dodecane
was used as a probe reaction to evaluate the catalytic performance
of these Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts. The conversion of n-dodecane and the isomerization selectivity of iso-dodecane was demonstrated in Figure 8. Among the four catalysts, Pt–N exhibited the
highest hydroisomerization conversion and selectivity, which up to
76 and 84%, respectively. The conversion of the n-dodecane was mainly correlated with the platinum particle size,
the location of Pt on the support and the valence state of platinum
in the metal precursors. As the Pt particle size increased, the conversion
of the catalysts decreased in the order of Pt–N (1.78 nm) >
Pt–Cl (1.88 nm) ≈ Pt–C (1.94 nm) > Pt–NCl
(2.74 nm). The Pt–NCl catalyst displayed the largest particle
size and therefore with the lowest catalytic activity. In addition,
the increase in the Pt particle size also led to a decrease in metal
dispersion, which in turn affected the conversion of n-dodecane. Combined with the characterization results of H2-TPR, it was clear that Pt mostly existed on the external surface
of the support for catalysts of Pt–N and Pt–Cl, while
quite a lot of platinum particles located in the internal pores of
SAPO-11 for Pt–NCl and these platinum particles are difficult
to reduce at a low temperature. Consequently, Pt–N and Pt–Cl
show better hydroisomerization conversion up to 76 and 63%, respectively.
Although Pt–Cl with the most platinum particles on the external
surface of the support, its hydroisomerization conversion was lower
than Pt–N, this may be due to the valence state of Pt in the
metal precursors. Pt–N with Pt(II) while Pt–Cl with
Pt(IV) in the precursors, combines with the hydroisomerization conversion,
it is clear that Pt(II) in the precursors is more favorable for the
isomerization reaction than Pt(IV).

and isomerization
selectivity of n-dodecane on Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts
with different Pt precursors. Reaction Conditions: Temperature 320
°C, atmospheric pressure, H2/n-C12
(mol/mol) = 15.0, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) = 4.0 h–1.

The hydroisomerization selectivity
of the iso-dodecane could be related to the number
of Brønsted acid sites and Pt crystal planes. The number of Lewis
acid sites seemed that no direct effect on the hydroisomerization
selectivity. On the other hand, when the number of Brønsted acid
sites is reduced, the hydroisomerization selectivity of the catalysts
increased in the order of Pt–NCl < Pt–C ≈
Pt–N. The Pt–Cl catalyst owned the largest number of
acid sites, but it displayed the worst hydroisomerization selectivity.
Therefore, the number of Brønsted acid sites is a key factor
to improve the hydroisomerization selectivity of the n-dodecane. Moreover, it may be concluded that catalysts with the
Pt(111) face are beneficial to the hydroisomerization selectivity
of n-dodecane, as Pt–N and Pt–C catalysts
with Pt(111) showing better hydroisomerization selectivity than the
catalyst of Pt–NCl and Pt–Cl with the Pt(100) face.

The yield of the products over different catalysts exhibited a similar
trend. As can be seen in Figure 9, hydroisomerization was the dominant reaction, and
Pt–N displayed the highest percentage of i-C12 (63%) and the lowest n-C12 (24%), but Pt–NCl
performed just the opposite, which were 32% i-C12
and 59% n-C12, respectively. The cracking products
of n-dodecane included C1 ≈ C5, C6, C7, C8,
C9, C10, and C11 fractions. Except for a small amount of the C6 component
in the products, the other cracking components were nearly unable
to be detected. According to the above results, Pt–N is an
effective catalyst for the isomerization of n-dodecane,
further indicating that the Pt precursors affect the catalytic activity
of the catalysts in the hydroisomerization of n-dodecane.

= 15.0, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) = 4.0 h–1.

2.7 Mechanism of n-Dodecane Hydroisomerization on Pt/SAPO-11
The
mechanism of hydroisomerization of normal paraffin in literature was
summarized as follows: bifunctional mechanism,41 shape selective catalytic mechanism,42,43 and
chain reaction mechanism.44 The classic
dual-functional mechanism is currently used to guide the design of
the catalysis and investigate the hydroisomerization reactions.13−15 The process of hydroisomerization
of n-dodecane on Pt/SAPO-11 with bifunctional active
sites was shown in Figure 10. The n-dodecane is first adsorbed on the
metal of Pt and dehydration to n-dodecene. The n-dodecene is then transferred from the metal center to
the acid center, and forms the corresponding alkylcarbenium ions.
These ions undergo skeletal rearrangement, alkyl shify and hydride
shify then form the branched olefin. At the same time, the fracture
of the alkylcarbenium ions is also carried out on the acidic center
of the Brønsted acid. The isomerizing and cracking products are iso-dodecene and hydrocarbons with less than 12 carbon atoms,
respectively. The iso-dodecene is then transferred
to the metal center for hydrogenation to form iso-dodecane and desorption, then the process of the hydroisomerization
is complete.

catalysts.

3 Conclusions
Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, Pt(NH3)4(Ac)2, (NH4)2PtCl4, and H2PtCl6 were used as
Pt precursors to investigate their effects on the performance of Pt/SAPO-11
catalysts for n-dodecane hydroisomerization. The
results indicated that the platinum precursors significantly affected
the performance of the catalysts for hydroisomerization of n-dodecane. The catalyst derived from Pt (NH3)4(NO3)2 displayed the best hydroisomerization
activity and selectivity of 76.1 and 84.2%, respectively.

The
hydroisomerization conversion of n-dodecane is mainly
affected by the platinum particle size, platinum dispersion, the location
of platinum whether the internal or external surface of SAPO-11, and
the valence state of platinum. In general, as the Pt particle size
increases, the conversion of n-dodecane decreases
in the order of Pt–N > Pt–Cl ≈ Pt–C
> Pt–NCl. The results of H2-TPR reveal that Pt
exists on the external surface of the support and is beneficial for
the catalyst performance, and Pt(II) in the precursors is more favorable
for the isomerization reaction than Pt(IV). The hydroisomerization
selectivity of n-dodecane is determined by the number
of Brønsted acid sites and platinum crystal planes. The experiments
showed that a suitable number of Brønsted acid sites and Pt(111)
face of the catalysts are in favor of improving the hydroisomerization
selectivity of the n-dodecane.

Overall, the
platinum particle size, platinum dispersion, the location, and valence
states of Pt, the number of Brønsted acid sites and Pt crystal
planes are influenced by Pt precursors, which in turn affect the performance
of the catalysts for the hydroisomerization of n-dodecane.

Pesudoboethmite
(78.4 wt % Al2O3, Chalco Shandong Co., Ltd),
silica colloidal gel (30 wt % SiO2, Jiangyin Saiwei Electronics
Co., Ltd), and phosphoric acid (85 wt % H3PO4, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were used as sources of Al,
Si, and P. Di-n-propylamine (DPA, chemically pure)
was used as structure-directing agents. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (AR) and Pt(NH3)4(Ac)2 (AR) were supplied by Kunming Institute of Precious
Metals. (NH4)2PtCl4 (AR) was purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and H2PtCl6·6H2O (AR) was purchased from Aladdin.

4.2 Catalyst Preparation
SAPO-11 molecular sieve was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis
method and the procedures of the method can be found in the literature.45 The synthesis procedure was described as follows:
first, phosphoric acid was mixed with a certain amount of water to
get a phosphoric acid solution, then aluminum was slowly added to
the phosphoric acid solution and the mixture solution was kept stirring
for 2 h to obtain phosphorus–aluminum colloid; second, the
template DPA were added drop-wise into the colloid and the mixture
was still kept stirring until it became homogeneous. After that, the
silicon source was slowly added and the pH of the colloid was adjusted
to 5 with 1 mol·L–1 H2SO4 or 1 mol·L–1 NH3·H2O. Keep stirring until the colloid was uniformly mixed, and retain
all the materials in the mixture in a molar composition of 1.0Al2O3/0.3SiO2/1.0P2O5/2.0DPA/50H2O; third, the mixture was transferred into
a PTFE-containing stainless-steel autoclave and maintained the stability
for crystallization at 180 °C for 96 h. After that, the samples
were centrifuged and washed, dried at 120 °C overnight. Finally,
the as-synthesized SAPO-11 was calcined at 600 °C for 6 h to
remove the organic template and the SAPO-11 molecular sieve was obtained.

This self-made SAPO-11 molecular sieve was used as the support,
Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2, Pt (NH3)4(Ac)2, (NH4)2PtCl4, and H2PtCl6 were selected
as the platinum precursors, denoted as Pt–N, Pt–C, Pt–NCl,
and Pt–Cl, respectively. All the Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts were
prepared by an impregnation method and the Pt loading was 0.5 wt %.
After being dried at 120 °C overnight, the samples were calcined
at 500 °C for 4 h.

4.3 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction patterns
were obtained on a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(40 kV, 30 mA). The samples were scanned with a rate of 5°·min–1 from 5° to 60°.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
test was operated on a Micromeritics ASAP 3020 apparatus. The samples
were degassed at 300 °C for 3 h in vacuum before the measurement.
The specific surface area was calculated by the BET equation. The
total pore volume (Vpore) was estimated
at a relative pressure of 0.99. The micropore volume (Vmicro-pore) was calculated using the t-plot method. The mean pore diameter (Dpore) was calculated using Dpore = 4Vpore/SBET.

TEM was operated on the Tecani F30 with an acceleration voltage of
300 kV. The samples were first reduced with H2 at 400 °C
for 4 h, then suspended in ethanol, and sonicating for 20 min. The
dispersed samples were dripped on the carbon-coated copper grid and
dried at room temperature.

H2-TPR was operated on
a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 instrument and a TCD detector was
used for the signal detection. 100 mg of the samples were loaded into
a quartz U-tube reactor and pretreated with helium at 150 °C
for 60 min with a flow rate of 40 mL·min–1.
After the temperature was cooled down to 50 °C, the gas was switched
to 5% H2/Ar at the same flow rate until the TCD signal
was level. The temperature was then raised from 50 to 800 °C
at a ramp of 10 °C·min–1.

CO chemisorption
was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020C instrument. 100 mg of
samples were loaded into the reactor and reduced with H2 at 400 °C for 4 h, followed by flushing with a helium flow
at the same temperature for 1 h. Afterward, the temperature was cooled
to room temperature and maintained at that temperature for some time
until the baseline was stable. A certain volume of CO flowed through
the catalysts until the peak areas of CO pulses did not change. Then,
the total volume of CO consumed can be used to calculate the metal
dispersion.

NH3-TPD was performed on the same apparatus
as H2-TPR. 100 mg of the samples were placed in a quartz
U-tube reactor and pretreated with helium at 300 °C for 60 min
with a flow rate of 40 mL·min–1. After that,
the samples were reduced with a H2 flow at 400 °C
for 4 h, then cooled to 100 °C. Switching to NH3/Ar
(5/95) at 100 °C for 120 min with a flow rate of 40 mL·min–1, then purged with helium for 60 min to remove the
physically adsorbed NH3. After the baseline was flushed,
the temperature was raised from 100 to 800 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C·min–1. The desorbed ammonia of
the catalyst was detected by a mass spectrometer.

Pyridine-adsorbed
infrared (Py-IR) was performed on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus instrument.
The catalyst was pressed into a sheet (about 15 mg, Φ 12 mm)
and placed in the middle of the cell body, then reduced in hydrogen
for 4 h at 400 °C before treatment under vacuum for 4 h at the
same temperature. Then, the temperature was cooled down to room temperature
and adsorbed pyridine for 20 min. After reaching equilibrium, the
pyridine-adsorbed system was evacuated at 300 °C and the IR spectra
were recorded after deduction of the background spectra. The quantitative
calculation of Brønsted and Lewis acidity by Py-IR analysis was
based on the equations: C(pyridine on B sites) =
1.88IA(B)R2/W, C(pyridine on L sites) = 1.42 IA(L)R2/W, and the specific information was shown
in the literature.46

4.4 Catalytic Performance Assessment
Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were first reduced in H2 at 400 °C for 4 h. The hydroisomerization of n-dodecane was operated in a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric.
The reaction conditions were H2/n-C12
(mol/mol) = 15.0, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) = 4.0 h–1 and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 6000 h–1. The reaction temperature was 320 °C. In the
assessment of catalyst performance, 0.5 g of (20–40 mesh) catalysts
were load into a tubular reactor, and both ends of the bed were filled
with a certain amount of 20–40 mesh quartz sand. N-dodecane was pumped continuously into the reactor, together with
a co-feed H2. The reactant and the products were analyzed
on-line by a GC-950 equipped with a flame ionization detector and
a PONA-50 m column.

The conversion (Xn-C12) of n-dodecane, the selectivity
to iso-dodecane (Siso), the cracking products (Scr), the yield
of iso-dodecane (Yiso), and the cracking products (Ycr) were
calculated as follows          where Fn-C12,0 and Fn-C12 denote the flow rate of n-C12 in the feed and the product (g/h), respectively; Fiso and Fcr denote
the flow rate of i-C12 and the cracking components
in the product (g/h), respectively; Yiso and Ycr denote the yield of i-C12 and the cracking components in the product.
