Derivatives
of 1-dimethylamino-5-propionylnaphthalene that constrain
the carbonyl group into a five-, six-, and seven-membered ring were
prepared, and their fluorescence quenching in protic solvents was
studied. Evidence for enhanced quenching due to carbonyl twisting
out of the molecular plane is presented, but this effect is heavily
masked by the strong quenching by all of the derivatives and by the
ring size-dependent deactivation seen in polar, aprotic solvents.
Calculations show strong, ring size-dependent vibrational coupling
between the carbonyl group and the naphthalene ring in the first excited
state.

Introduction
Naphthalene derivatives
bearing a widely spaced electron-accepting
carbonyl group and a dialkylamino electron-donating group show charge-transfer
excited state emission. The archetypal member of this set is 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene
(2,6-Prodan).1 Because charge transfer
gives rise to a large excited state dipole moment, its emission shows
strong solvatochromism.2−5 In addition, its emission is slightly quenched in methanol (23%
reduction). Constraining the carbonyl group in a six-membered ring
has no significant effect on the methanol quenching (25%).6 However, if the carbonyl group is in a seven-membered
ring, the emission is strongly quenched (84%) in methanol. A similarly
strong quenching effect was observed for 6-pivaloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene.7 The carbonyl group is forced out of the molecular
plane in the latter two compounds. The enhanced quenching was ascribed
to the enforced out-of-plane twisting of the carbonyl group.

The Prodan regioisomer having the donor and acceptor groups in
the 1,5-positions is very similar to 2,6-Prodan in terms of its excited
state charge transfer and resulting solvatochromism.8−11 Unlike 2,6-Prodan, the emission of the 1,5-isomer shows much stronger
quenching in methanol (98%). This paper examines the relationship
between twisting of the carbonyl group on the fluorescence quenching
in protic solvents for a set of four 1,5-Prodan compounds: the parent
structure (1) and three derivatives where the carbonyl
is in a five-, six- and seven-membered ring (2–4) (Figure 1).

Results
Preparation
of 1,5-Prodan Ring Derivatives
Ring derivatives 2–4 are prepared as shown in Scheme 1. The requisite number
of atoms for each ring was appended by the Negishi coupling with intermediate 5. Intramolecular electrophilic acylation created the ring
structures. For 2 and 3, the cyclization
was accomplished using polyphosphoric acid with the ethyl esters.
For 3, the cyclization did not go to completion, and
unreacted ester was removed by saponification. The polyphosphoric
acid method failed in the case of 4. Cyclization required
more forcing conditions: using the acid chloride as the reactant and
aluminum trichloride as the promoter. The precursor to all three compounds
is compound 5, obtained by methylation of the corresponding
primary amine. While 5 is commercially available, it
was prepared in seven steps from 6-bromo-2-naphthol by the route described
in the Supporting Information.

Photophysical Studies
The four compounds
show one absorption
band above 300 nm. The maximum absorption wavelength for each varies
by no more than 3 nm in different solvents (e.g., toluene, ethyl acetate,
and methanol). For 1 and 4, the absorptions
are centered at 332 and 330 nm, while for 2 and 3, they are redshifted to 355 and 351 nm. The position of
the absorption band is related to the twisting of the carbonyl group.
Compound 2 with the coplanar carbonyl group shows the
longest wavelength absorption band, whereas compound 4 with the most twisted carbonyl group (vide infra) shows the shortest.

The relative quantum yields for 1–4 were determined in toluene using anthracene (Φ = 0.30) as
a reference. They are 0.42 ± 0.03, 0.64 ± 0.03, 0.56 ±
0.01, and 0.43 ± 0.02, indicating that all are strong fluorophores.
Quantum yields are the largest in chlorobenzene (0.44, 0.75, 0.59,
and 0.52) and decrease as the solvent polarity increases for the aprotic
solvents (Table 1).
In acetonitrile, they have all decreased from the maximum values by
roughly two-thirds. But in the case of 2, the decrease
is only by 50%, while for 1, 3, and 4, they are 70, 68, and 73%, respectively.

a Solvents are cyclohexane, toluene,
chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, acetone,
acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, isopropanol, butanol, propanol,
ethanol, and methanol.

All
of the four exhibit strong solvatochromism in their emission
spectra (Table 1).

The fluorescence maxima successively shift to higher wavelengths
as the solvent polarity increases as a result of the charge-transfer
nature of the excited states. The fluorescence spectra in the various
solvents are presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S4). Plots of the fluorescence
center-of-mass versus the ET(30) solvent
polarity parameter12 are shown in Figure 2. The slopes of these
plots are a measure of the degree of charge transfer in the excited
state. For these four compounds, the slopes are close in magnitude
(−151, −153, −124, and −133) suggesting
similar degrees of charge transfer in the relaxed excited states.
The plot for the five-membered ring (2) shows a consistent
displacement to shorter wavelength emission values.

up open, green dashed line), and 4 (violet diamond open,
violet solid line) in toluene, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, ethyl
acetate, diethyl ether, acetone, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide,
isopropanol, and ethanol.

The fluorescence of 1–4 is strongly
quenched by protic solvents. In going from acetonitrile to isopropanol,
the quantum yields decrease by factors of 84, 57, 84, and 87%. These
decreases occur despite the fact that isopropanol is less polar than
acetonitrile (Kamlet–Taft π* values of 0.48 vs 0.75).13 The decreases in the quantum yields are accompanied
by redshifts in the fluorescence maxima due to H-bonding of the carbonyl
group with the protic solvents in the excited state. The ring size
has a strong influence on the H-bond-induced quenching. The slopes
of the plots of the quenching magnitude (defined as the log of Itoluene/Isolvent) versus the solvent acidity (H-bond donating ability)14,15 are a measure of the degree to which H-bond formation from the protic
solvent to the carbonyl oxygen in the excited state creates an efficient
deactivation pathway to the ground state. The plots for 1–4 are shown in Figure 3. The slopes and standard deviations from
duplicate determinations are in descending order: 2.96 ± 0.05
(4), 2.77 ± 0.03 (1), 2.18 ± 0.01
(3), and 1.92 ± 0.01 (2). This relative
ordering is also manifested in the quantum yields in the protic solvents
in Table 1.

1-pentanol (0.32), 1-butanol (0.34), 1-propanol (0.37), ethanol (0.40),
and methanol (0.61).

Computational Studies
The electronic structures of
the ground and first excited states were calculated with Gaussian
16.16 The calculations not only provided
the degree of twist of the carbonyl group out of the molecular plane,
but they also characterized the energy well of the twisting coordinate
surrounding the optimum twist angle. The results are shown in Figure 4. Both 1 and 4 have significantly twisted carbonyl groups in
the ground state (137° and 139°). Not surprisingly, the
calculations show that 2 has a coplanar carbonyl group.
For the six-membered ring (3), the carbonyl group is
slightly twisted (166°). The wells are steep for 2 and 4 and broad for the acyclic parent (1). In the excited state, the energy minima shift toward coplanarity
for 1 and 4 but more so for the former (170°)
than the latter (146°). The wells are steeper in the excited
state. For 1, there is another minimum nearer the 0°
dihedral angle (not shown), but it is slightly higher in energy.

up open, green dashed line), and 4 (black diamond open,
black solid line) in the ground (bottom) and first excited states
(top).

The dimethylamino groups show
similar structural behavior for all
four compounds, and this behavior for 1 was noted in
our previous study.11 The dimethylamino
groups are twisted out of plane by 47° (average of two cisoid
dihedral angles) in the ground state. In the excited state, they twist
toward planarity (∼33°), and the amino groups become less
pyramidal. The nitrogens become more positively charged in the excited
state (−0.17 → +0.33) as a result of the charge transfer.
The dipole moments increase from an average of 5.0 to 7.5 D.

The long wavelength absorption is calculated to be a relatively
straightforward HOMO → LUMO electronic transition. These frontier
molecular orbitals are shown in Figure 5 for compound 4. The amino n orbital significantly
contributes to the HOMO, while the carbonyl π* orbital significantly
contributes to the LUMO. The twisting of the carbonyl group out of
the naphthalene plane is revealed in the twisting of corresponding
orbital components in the LUMO. Not surprisingly, the carbonyl twisting
partially explains the differences in the absorption spectra. The
twisting reduces the orbital overlap between the carbonyl carbon and
the naphthalene ring aryl carbon and raises the LUMO orbital energy.
The relative ordering of the LUMO energies for 1–4 (5.13, 0, 0.03, and 4.79 kcal/mol, respectively) roughly
follows the degree of twisting in the ground state geometries (Figure 4, bottom). The HOMO
energies are less affected (1.07, 0, 1.2, and 1.97 kcal/mol).

Figure 5 HOMO (left)
and LUMO (right) for the ground state of 4.

Calculations of the normal vibrational modes reveal another
consequence
of carbonyl twisting. In the ground state, the carbonyl stretching
modes are not coupled strongly to other vibrational modes. The carbonyl
vibrations are calculated to be at 1705, 1696, 1671, and 1695 cm–1, respectively, for 1–4. In the first excited state, there is significant coupling between
the carbonyl vibration and aryl C–C and C–H modes. A
crude classification of these modes is shown in Figure 6 that depicts the types of coupling interactions
with nearby aryl C–C bonds.

Figure 6 Classification of carbonyl ring-coupled
vibrational modes for the
excited states of 1–4.

The vibrational frequencies that involve carbonyl stretching
are
shown in Table 2. The
displacement of the carbonyl oxygen in these modes is presented as
a percentage relative to the maximum displacement in the set of modes
for each compound. The modes that involve the largest displacements
of the carbonyl oxygen are the symmetric and antisymmetric W modes,
where there is significant coupling to the C6–C7 bond. For 2–4, the greatest displacement is seen
in the symmetric stretching (sW), whereas for 1, it is
in the antisymmetric mode (aW). The averages of the sW and aW frequencies
decrease with increasing ring size for 2–4, but the average for 1 has an intermediate
value (1580, 1606, 1577, and 1526 cm–1). This result
is consistent with the nearly identical carbonyl-twisting angles for 1 and 3 in the excited state.

Discussion
The photophysical behavior of 1–4 is best presented as a contrast to the behavior of the related 2,6-Prodan
derivatives 6–9 (Figure 7). The first point of difference
between the 1,5-Prodan derivatives and the 2,6-derivatives is that
the former shows strong quenching in protic solvents, while for the
latter, quenching is strong only for certain structures. The slopes
of the plots of quenching magnitude versus solvent acidity (cf. Figure 3) are 0.74, 2.20,
0.60, and 1.96, respectively, for 6–9. Compounds 7 and 9 show much stronger
quenching than 6 and 8. Compound 8 in particular is calculated to have a coplanar carbonyl group in
both the ground state and excited states. Compounds 7 and 9 have twisted carbonyl groups. In contrast to
the behavior of these compounds, the rigidly planar five-membered
ring derivative 2 shows a quenching sensitivity that
is nearly as strong as 9. The twisted carbonyl derivatives 1 and 4 show even stronger quenching. Thus, the
inherent strong quenching by protic solvents will mask any additional
contribution of carbonyl twisting to the deactivation process for
the 1,5-Prodan series.

Figure 7 Structures of related 2,6-Prodan derivatives 6–9.

A second difference in
behavior is the effect of solvent polarity
on the quantum yield in the absence of H-bonding. For the 2,6-derivatives,
the quantum yield increases with polarity, and the strongest emission
is often seen in isopropanol, even with the twisted carbonyl compounds.
This behavior is a result of reduced intersystem crossing to the triplet
state as the excited singlet state energy is lowered.17 In contrast, the quantum yield decreases with increasing
polarity for 1–4 as internal conversion
to the ground state is enhanced by the smaller energy gap. This effect
will also mask any additional contribution of carbonyl twisting to
the overall deactivation.

Finally, the quantum yields are affected
by the size of the ring
in aprotic solvents. The larger rings show weaker emission for the
same solvent. The acyclic compound 1 shows emission that
is as weak as the seven-membered ring 4. The behavior
for the ring derivatives is attributed to a general structural flexibility
and not to carbonyl twisting specifically. This effect likewise masks
contributions by carbonyl twisting to quenching since carbonyl twisting
and structural flexibility due to increasing ring size go hand in
hand.

Despite the masking effects above, there is some evidence
for enhanced
quenching due to H-bonding with the twisted-carbonyl groups in the
1,5-Prodan series. The quenching factors in methanol relative to chlorobenzene
for 1–4 are 150, 20, 70, and 260,
respectively. The fact that the seven-membered ring is quenched much
more so that even the acyclic compound might be due to this additional
contribution. The computational results show that carbonyl twisting
affects the vibrational coupling of the carbonyl group with the aromatic
ring. The frequency of an H-bond with the carbonyl in the excited
state would be closed to the first harmonic of the carbonyl frequency,
so it is reasonable to consider the carbonyl vibration and its coupling
with the ring as important in the deactivation process. Deactivation
can be made more efficient if the energy of the excited state can
be dispersed over a greater number of vibrational modes. Hence, the
coupling with the naphthalene ring may provide an explanation for
the strong quenching of the 1,5-Prodan derivatives. The relevance,
if any, of the progression to lower wavenumbers with increasing ring
size for the main carbonyl vibration to the deactivation process remains
speculative at this point.

Conclusions
1,5-Prodan and the five-,
six-, and seven-membered ring derivatives 1–4 are strongly fluorescent in moderately
nonpolar, aprotic solvents. Fluorescence quantum yields decrease as
the solvent polarity increases in a manner that depends on the ring
size but not necessarily on carbonyl twisting. The fluorescence is
strongly quenched in protic solvents. The magnitude of the quenching
depends on the H-bond-donating ability of the solvent. The quenching
shows some evidence for enhancement due to carbonyl twisting. However,
this effect is small relative to the strong quenching by protic solvents.
Further, it is obscured by the ring size-dependent deactivation caused
by the energy-lowering effect of higher solvent polarity. Calculations
show strong vibrational coupling between the carbonyl group and the
naphthalene ring in the first excited state. The coupling shows a
dependence on the carbonyl-twisting angle.

Experimental Section
General
Information
NMR spectra were obtained with
an Agilent DD2-400 spectrometer. IR spectra were taken on a Shimadzu
IRTracer-100. High-resolution ESI-MS was acquired with a Bruker Apex-Qe
instrument. All solvents were spectrophotometric grade. Reagents were
obtained from Acros Organics or Sigma-Aldrich. DMAC was freshly distilled
under vacuum before use. Absorption and fluorescence data were collected
using a fiber optic system with an Ocean Optics Maya CCD detector
using a miniature deuterium/tungsten lamp and a 366 or 405 nm LED
light source, respectively. Solution cells were thermostated at 23
°C. The emission intensity data was subjected to the following
treatment: (1) electronic noise was subtracted, (2) the wavelength
values were converted to wavenumbers, (3) the corresponding net intensity
values were multiplied by λ2/λmax2 to account for the effect of the abscissa-scale transformation,18 and (4) the resulting intensity values were
divided by the spectral response of the Hamamatsu S10420 CCD. Electronic
structure calculations were conducted using Gaussian 16.16 Ground-state geometries were optimized using
the DFT B3YLP method employing the 6-311G+(2d,p) basis set. Relaxed,
redundant coordinate (dihedral angle) scans were conducted using the
6-31G+(2d,p) basis set. Excited states were optimized using the TD-DFT
B3LYP method employing the 6-31G+(2d,p) basis set. Relaxed, redundant
coordinate (dihedral angle) scans on the excited states were conducted
using the 6-31G+(d) basis set. All calculations used the IEFPCM solvent
model for acetonitrile. Zinc was activated by washing twice successively
with 1.2 M HCl, EtOH, and Et2O and drying in vacuo. The
organozinc reagent, 5-ethoxy-5-oxopentylzinc bromide, was freshly
prepared from ethyl 5-bromopentanoate. Activated Zn (2.1 g) was covered
with DMAC (15 mL) under Ar and treated with I2 (0.39 g).
After the red color was consumed, ethyl 5-bromopentanoate (4.5 g)
was added, and the mixture was heated to 70 ° C overnight. Titration
with I2 indicated that the organozinc concentration was
0.8 M. The reagent was dispensed through a 0.2 μ syringe filter.
The preparation of 5 is described in the Supporting Information.

6-Bromo-N,N-dimethylnaphthalen-1-amine (5, 1.57 g, 6.28 mmol) was dissolved in DMAC (20 mL) under nitrogen.
Bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride (0.40 g, 0.61 mmol) was added,
and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. A solution of 0.5 M 4-ethoxy-4-oxopropylzinc
bromide (12 mL, 6 mmol) was added dropwise, and the reaction was stirred
overnight. The next day, bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride (0.26
g, 0.10 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred for 10 min.
A solution of 0.5 M 4-ethoxy-4-oxopropylzinc bromide (6 mL, 3 mmol)
was added dropwise, and the reaction was stirred for an additional
6 h. The reaction was quenched with water (300 mL) and stirred for
an hour. The organic product was salted out with NaCl (60 g) and collected
by suction filtration. The solid was dried under vacuum (0.1 Torr)
overnight then covered with polyphosphoric acid (4 mL). The slurry
was heated to 110 °C for 2 h under nitrogen. The reaction was
allowed to cool, covered with ice-water, and stirred overnight. The
solid/liquid mixture was extracted with 33% ethyl acetate in hexanes
(150 mL). The organic phase was washed with water (100 mL) and 5%
NaHCO3 (100 mL), dried over CaCl2, filtered,
and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column
chromatography with hexanes/EtOAc (0 → 10%) giving 2 (70 mg, 0.31 mmol, 5% over 2 steps). 1H NMR (CDCl3, δ): 8.87 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1 H), 8.50

from 5 (1.17 g, 4.68 mmol) and 4-ethoxy-4-oxopropylzinc
bromide
giving 3 and some (∼15%) uncyclized ester after
heating with polyphosphoric acid and column chromatography. The uncyclized
ester was removed by saponification (50 mL of EtOH, 10 mL of H2O, and 5 g of KOH, reflux 7 h), concentration, extraction
(15% EtOAc/hexanes, 125 mL), and washing (1 M NaOH, twice, 100 mL
of ea; ice-cold H2O, twice, 100 mL of ea). Drying the organic
layer over CaCl2, filtration, and concentration in vacuo
gave 3 (0.33 g, 1.38 mmol, 29%, two steps, and saponification). 1H NMR (CDCl3, δ): 9.04 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 1 H), 8.42 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 1 H), 7.53

4-(Dimethylamino)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-11H-cyclohepta[a]naphthalen-11-one (4)
The Negishi
coupling was performed as above from 5 (0.76 g, 3.0 mmol)
and 5-ethoxy-5-oxopentylzinc bromide (the second addition was not
needed). The crude ester coupling product was taken up in CH2Cl2 (100 mL), filtered through Celite, and concentrated
in vacuo. The solid (∼0.43 g) was dissolved in a solution of
KOH (1.0 g, 18 mmol) in EtOH (18 mL), and the mixture was heated to
reflux for 4 h. The EtOH was removed in vacuo, and the residue was
diluted in water (100 mL). The aqueous phase was washed three times
with CH2Cl2 (25 mL of ea). The aqueous phase
was acidified with concd aq HCl (10 mL) and then extracted three times
with CH2Cl2 (25 mL of ea). The combined organic
phases were dried over CaCl2, filtered, concentrated, and
dried in vacuo giving the crude acid (∼0.37 g). The acid was
dissolved in CH2Cl2 (20 mL). A small amount
of DMF (seven drops) was added, followed by oxalyl choride (0.39 g,
3.1 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 1.5 h. Another portion of
oxalyl choride (0.20 g, 1.6 mmol) was added, and the reaction was
stirred for 30 min. A third portion of oxalyl choride (0.20 g, 1.6
mmol) was added but did not produce bubbles. After stirring for 5
min, the solvents were removed in vacuo, and the residue was dried
in vacuo for 3 h to remove excess oxalyl chloride. The dried residue
was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (25 mL). Aluminum chloride
(0.52 g, 3.9 mmol) was added at room temperature, and the mixture
was heated to reflux for 2 h. After the reaction was cooled, it was
quenched with aq NaHCO3. The mixture was poured into 15%
aq NaCl (150 mL) and extracted three times with CH2Cl2 (50 mL of ea). The organic phases were combined, dried over
CaCl2, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product
was purified by column chromatography with hexanes/EtOAc (0 →
10%) giving 4 (0.077 g, 0.33 mmol, 11% over four steps). 1H NMR (CDCl3, δ): 8.28 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 1 H), 7.68 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 1 H), 7.39
