Hydrolysis of the biomass platform compound furfural can produce
a bulk of fine chemicals because of its multiple functional groups.
Developing an efficient catalytic system to regulate the process toward
some desirable products has always been a hot research area. Herein,
the novel Ni-based catalysts (Ni-MFC-X, X = 300, 400...800) synthesized by pyrolysis of the 2D Ni-based metal–organic
framework (MOF) in the temperature range 300–800 °C show
good performance for selective hydrogenation of furfural (FUR). Interestingly,
the calcination temperature of the MOF precursor plays an important
role in hydrogenation of furfural with controllable selectivity toward
furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and tetrahydro FOL (THFOL). Ni-MFC-500 affords
us 92.5% conversion of furfural and 59.5% selectivity of FOL. Ni-MFC-700
can promote hydrogenation of furfural with 91.8% conversion and 51.0%
selectivity of THFOL. Furthermore, the stability of as-obtained Ni-MFC-500
and Ni-MFC-700 was also very impressive in this reaction system.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Furfural is widely identified as a promising biomass platform compound
with huge potential to produce a large number of valuable chemicals
because of its abundant and inexpensive source, high reactivity based
on the carbonyl (C=O), π-conjugated (C=C–C=C)
groups, and a five-membered ring structure.1−5 Hydrogenation of furfural can afford us with a variety
of fine chemicals in the following pathways (see Scheme 1). (i) 2-Methylfuran and 2-methyl
tetrahydrofuran (THF) via hydrodeoxygenation. (ii) Furfuryl alcohol
(FOL) and tetrahydro FOL (THFOL) via hydrogenation. (iii) 1,4-Pentanediol
and 1,2-pentanediol via ring-opening hydrogenolysis.6−13 (iv) Furan and THF via hydrodeocaboxylation. Selective hydrogenation
of furfural to FOL and THFOL via path (ii) is highly desired because
of their significant applications in the production of pentanediols,
environmental benign solvents, industrial resins, and fuel additives.
Developing the efficient catalytic system to control the hydrogenation
of furfural has been the research hotspot for many years. A large
number of noble metallic catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Pt, Au,
and Ru) have been reported for effective hydrogenation of furfural
to FOL.14−22 Appropriate Pd-, Pt-, or Ru-based catalysts can effectively promote
the transformation from furfural (FUR) to THFOL.23−25 However, it
is more preferable to utilize some nonprecious metal catalysts, especially
some supported heterogeneous catalysts because of their abundant resources
and sustainable development. Cu-, Co-, and Fe-based catalysts show
an advantage for selectively catalyzing the hydrogenation of the C=O
bond to afford FOL as the main product, avoiding the hydrogenation
of the furan ring, which may be because of their lower hydrogenation
ability compared with noble metals.26−28 Among non-noble metals,
Ni catalysts seldom favor the selective hydrogenation of furfural
toward FOL or THFOL because of their excellent hydrogenation activity.
Modification of nickel is thus necessary to improve the selective
hydrogenation along the aforementioned second path.29−31 Three modification
methods of Ni-based catalysts were summarized by Royer et al.11 (i) Adding oxophilic metals, such as Fe, Mg,
and Co, to precisely control the amount and localize the additive.
(ii) Using oxide supports to interact with nickel strongly, such as
TiO2. (iii) Controlling the reaction conditions to suppress
the furan ring hydrogenation. However, the components and synthesis
of these catalysts are very complicated.

Scheme 1 Main Pathways of Furfural Hydrogenation
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a novel
attractive class of catalytic materials in view of their outstanding
designability.32−34 Noticeably, the active metal centers can be predesigned
as the metallic nodes of MOFs, in which the active metal centers are
confined to the matrix materials in the single-atom state. Therefore,
when MOFs were used as precursors of carbon matrix nanocomposites,
the active centers were incorporated and dispersed uniformly in the
carbon matrix.35,36 In our previous study, we used
one 2D Co-based MOF ([Co(tia)(H2O)2]n, tia2– = 5-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)isophthalate) as the precursor to fabricate Co-MOF-700
catalysts, in which Co-MOF-700 displayed good performance in catalytic
oxidation condensation of FUR with aliphatic alcohols-O2.37 Herein, we fabricated Ni-MFC catalysts
using 2D Ni-based MOFs ([Ni(tia)(H2O)2]n) as the precursor and investigated their
catalytic effect on selective hydrogenation of furfural. It is found
that the hydrogenation pathway is dominant when using Ni-MFC catalysts.
Interestingly, the calcination temperature of the MOF precursor plays
an important role in hydrogenation of furfural with controllable selectivity
toward FOL and THFOL.

Figure 1 Effect of reaction time on the selective hydrogenation of furfural:
(a) using Ni-MFC-500 as a catalyst, (b) using Ni-MFC-700 as a catalyst
[reaction conditions: furfural (0.1 g), catalyst (0.025 g), H2 pressure (2 MPa), and temperature (160 °C)].

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Evaluation
A 2D Ni-based
MOF ([Ni(tia)(H2O)2]n) was calcined at different temperatures under a N2 atmosphere
to afford us with Ni-MFC catalysts (Ni-MFC-300, 350...800, corresponding
to the calcining temperature at 300, 350, and 800 °C, respectively).
Ni-MFC catalysts were investigated for catalyzing hydrogenation of
furfural, and the results are displayed in Table 1. In our reaction system, FOL, THFOL, and
acetal were detected (see Scheme 2). Obviously, Ni-MFC catalysts have significant catalytic
effect on selective hydrogenation conversion of furfural (see entries
1 and 2–7 in Table 1). Very interestingly, the calcination temperature of the
MOF precursor plays an important role in hydrogenation of furfural
with controllable selectivity toward FOL and THFOL. Below 500 °C,
the selectivity of FOL and THFOL increased with the increasing calcination
temperature (entries 2–5 in Table 1). For further increasing calcination temperature,
the selectivity of FOL began to decrease but the selectivity of THFOL
continuously increased. The selectivity of FOL was up to the maximum
(59.5%), and then began to decrease with the increasing calcination
temperature (entries 6–8 in Table 1). Herein, Ni-MFC-500 affords us 92.5% conversion
of furfural, 59.5% selectivity of FOL, 30.9% selectivity of THFOL,
and 9.6% selectivity of acetal. Ni-MFC-700 can promote hydrogenation
of furfural with 91.8% conversion, 51.0% selectivity of THFOL, 39.1%
selectivity of FOL, and 9.9% selectivity of acetal.

analysis with the internal standard technique.

c Reaction conditions: 0.1 g of furfural,
0.025 g of the catalyst, in 15 mL of methanol, under 2 MPa H2, at 160 °C for 4 h.

2.2 Optimization of Reaction Conditions
With the best catalysts for producing FOL and THFOL in hand, respectively,
we investigated the effect of the reaction temperature, reaction time,
and reaction pressure in the Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalytic reaction
system, respectively. In the Ni-MFC-500 catalytic system, the conversion
of furfural was up to maximum (about 92%) in 4 h and the selectivity
of FOL increased at first and then decreased. When the reaction time
was prolonged to 3 h, the selectivity of FOL was up to 63.3%. However,
in the Ni-MFC-700 catalytic system, the selectivity of FOL was higher
than that of THFOL at the beginning. After 2 h, the selectivity of
FOL decreased, but the selectivity of THFOL increased gradually. When
the reaction time was prolonged to 6 h, the selectivity of THFOL was
up to 57.3%. Obviously, the Ni-MFC catalytic system can reach the
transformation equilibrium more quickly (Figure 1a, b).

We have carried out the reaction
in the pressure range 0.5–3 MPa, and the results are shown
in Figure 2. The conversion
of furfural increased in both catalytic reaction systems, when the
reaction pressure was increased. The selectivity of THFOL increased,
but the selectivity of FOL and acetal declined with the increasing
reaction pressure. Therefore, high pressure favors the production
of THFOL. Under 3 MPa H2 pressure, the selectivity of THFOL
was up to 55.2 and 53.8% in the Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalytic
reaction system, respectively (Figure 2a,b).

Figure 2 Effect of reaction pressure on the selective hydrogenation of furfural:
(a) using Ni-MFC 500 as a catalyst, (b) using Ni-MFC-700 as a catalyst
[reaction conditions: furfural (0.1 g), catalyst (0.025 g), temperature
(160 °C), and time (4 h)].

With the increasing reaction temperature, the conversion of furfural
and the selectivity of THFOL increased, while the selectivity of FOL
decreased (see Figure 3). Below 140 °C, the lower conversion was achieved and FOL dominated
in both the Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalytic systems. For example,
the selectivity of FOL was up to 80.7 and 55.0% at 120 °C, respectively.
The high yield of FOL was obtained using Ni-MFC-500 as a catalyst
at 160 °C. Upon further increasing the temperature, the yield
of the deep hydrogenation product (THFOL) continuously increased in
Ni-MFC-700 catalytic reaction systems. However, in the Ni-MFC-500
catalytic reaction system, the selectivity of THFOL remained unchanged
with the increasing temperature after 160 °C.

furfural: (a) using Ni-MFC-500 as a catalyst; (b) using Ni-MFC-700
as a catalyst [reaction conditions: furfural (0.1 g), catalyst (0.025
g), pressure (2 MPa), and time (4 h)].

2.3 Recyclability of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700
After being centrifuged and washed with a solvent, the used Ni-MFC-500
and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts were obtained for the next catalytic cycles.
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the conversion of furfural and the
amount of the desirable products were kept almost constant in the
consecutive six runs.

2.4 Characterization of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700
Catalysts
As shown in Figure 4a,g, the block shape of the MOF remains unchanged before
and after being calcined. The lamellar structures are clearly visible
in both Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts (see Figure 4b,h). Comparing Figure 4c with 4i, it is found that a large quantity of Ni nanoparticles with uniform
particle size was dispersed uniformly in the lamellar of Ni-MFC-700.
Although in Ni-MFC-500, Ni nanoparticles were not fully grown. This
explains that the hydrogenation capacity of Ni-MFC-700 is stronger
than Ni-MFC-500, which may be responsible for the higher selectivity
for THFOL. Unlike the traditional supported Ni-based catalysts, Ni
nanoparticles were not only dispersed on the surface but also inside
the interior of Ni-MFC-700 because the uniform Ni nanoparticles can
be observed on the fracture surface (see Figure 4i,4l). The elementary composition of the
spent Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 was determined by inductively coupled
plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (see Table S1). It was found that no Ni leaching occurred in the
course of the reaction. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of the spent catalyst was similar to that of the fresh sample (Figure 5). All these explain
that Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 have a good catalytic cycling performance.

Figure 4 SEM images of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts: (a–c)
for the fresh Ni-MFC-500; (d–f) for the used Ni-MFC-500; (g–i)
for the fresh Ni-MFC-700; and (j–l) for the used Ni-MFC-700.

Figure 5 XRD patterns of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts.

Transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis, and EDS elemental mapping of the Ni-MFC-500 catalyst
have been performed and incorporated into Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. It was found that Ni
nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in the Ni-MFC-500 (Figure S5a,b
in the Supporting Information). At the
same time, their lattice fringes are clearly seen in Figure S5c in
the Supporting Information. The EDS spectrum
of Ni-MFC-500 showed that the main components of the Ni-MFC-500 catalyst
are Ni, C, N, and O (Figure S5d in the Supporting Information). Element mapping also verified that the Ni nanoparticles
dispersed uniformly on the Ni-MFC-500 catalysts (Figure S5e in the Supporting Information). These results were in
agreement with the results from high-resolution scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) mapping of the Ni-MFC-500 catalyst (Figure S6 in
the Supporting Information).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of Ni-MFC-500
and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts is supplemented in Figures S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information. The best fitted peaks
of Ni 2p3/2 in Ni-MFC-500 at 853.1 and 856 eV may be ascribed
to the adsorption of Ni(0) and Ni(II) coordinated with pyridine nitrogen,
respectively. The peaks at 857.1 and 861.9 eV should be assigned to
Ni(II) coordinated with oxygen, respectively (Figure S8b in the Supporting Information). While the best fitted
peaks of Ni 2p3/2 in Ni-MFC-700 at 852.1, 853.3 eV were
attributed to metallic nickel, the peaks at 855.1 and 859.8 eV were
ascribed to NiO and Ni2O3 (see Figure S8b in
the Supporting Information).43−45 Obviously, the content of Ni(0) in Ni-MFC-700 is much larger than
that in Ni-MFC-500, which may be responsible for the higher yield
of the deep hydrogenolysis product THFOL.

The specific surface area (SBET) and
pore volume (Vpore) of Ni-MFC-700 and
Ni-MFC-500 were determined by the N2 physisorption technique,
and the results are supplemented in Figure S9 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information. The adsorption and desorption
hysteresis loop of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts were assigned
to H3 and H2, respectively, which showed the relatively uniform pores
in the latter. The pore size and pore volume of Ni-MFC-700 were also
larger than those of Ni-MFC-500.

The H2-pulse chemisorption of the catalyst is shown
in Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. The H2-pulse chemisorption parameters in Table S3 in
the Supporting Information showed that
the metal dispersion, metallic surface area (sample), and metallic
surface area (metal) of Ni-MFC-700 were larger than those of Ni-MFC-500,
which ascribed to the increasing exposure Ni nanoparticles along with
the increasing calcination temperature. Moreover, the average particle
size of Ni-MFC-700 was smaller than that of Ni-MFC-500.

The CO2-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) profiles
of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts are displayed in Figure S10
in the Supporting Information. No peaks
were observed below 600 °C, which were likely associated to decomposition
of carbonate-like species. Hence, the surface Lewis basic sites of
Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts were very weak. The broad peak
with the maximum at 630 °C of Ni-MFC-500 can be assigned to the
decomposition of the remnant organic framework. One strong peak at
about 750 °C was observed on the desorption curves of Ni-MFC-500
and Ni-MFC-700 catalysts, which may be ascribed to the reaction of
C component with CO2.

The result of the NH3-TPD experiment is shown in Figure
S13 in the Supporting Information. The
peak at 375 °C was ascribed to the acidity of the catalyst, in
which a broad peak of Ni-MOF-500 may be attributed to the corporation
between weak acid sites and the decomposition of the remnant MOFs.

The result of the NH3-TPD experiment is shown in Figure S12 in
the Supporting Information. The fitting
reduction peak of the catalyst at 525 °C would be assigned to
the presence of NiO and Ni2O3, which was in
agreement with the result of XPS.

Based on the aforementioned results of CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, H2-pulse chemisorption, and BET, the effect
of the calcination temperature on the structure of catalysts can be
summarized as follows: (i) the lower calcination temperature of 500
°C leads to the incomplete decomposition of the organic framework,
which was verified by the results of CO2-TPD and NH3-TPD of Ni-MFC-500 and Ni-MFC-700; (ii) the content of Ni(0)
element in Ni-MFC-700 was higher than that in Ni-MFC-500; (iii) the
pore size and pore volume in Ni-MFC-700 were larger than those in
Ni-MFC-500; (iv) the acidic sites of Ni-MFC-500 were more than those
of Ni-MFC-700.

2.5 Advantage of Our Reaction System Compared
with the Previous Report
Monometallic Ni-based and noble
metallic catalysts seldom favor the selective hydrogenation of furfural
toward FOL or THFOL because of their too high hydrogenation activity.
Although some modification strategies were used to functionalize these
catalysts for controlling the hydrogenation direction to produce FOL
or THFOL and the results were very good, developing the none-noble
metal catalysts are still desirable. The main work on hydrogenation
of furfural to FOL and THFOL using none-noble metal catalysts is displayed
in Table 4. The none-noble
metal of the Co-based catalyst can achieve high selectivity of FOL
and full conversion of furfural in the report of Liu co-workers and
Zhao co-workers.38−42 Herein, the developed Ni-MFC catalysts showed good performance in
catalyzing the transformation of furfural to FOL and THFOL..

2.6 Mechanism for Selective Hydrogenation of Furfural
toward FOL and THFOL
The kinetic curves of the transformation
are shown in Figure 6. The low conversion of furfural and 100% selectivity of acetal were
obtained at the beginning. The conversion of furfural and the selectivity
of FOL and THFOL increased with prolonging the reaction time but the
selectivity of acetal decreased. Based on these results, we assumed
that furfural condensed with alcohol to produce acetal with a weak
acidic catalyst at the beginning. Then, the active Ni(0) sites promoted
hydrolysis of acetals to FOL or THFOL. Of course, THFOL can also be
obtained by hydrogenolysis of the intermediate time-of-flight.

of the transformation of furfural in methanol (reaction conditions:
0.1 g of furfural, 0.025 g of the Ni-MFC-700 catalyst, in 15 mL of
methanol, under 2 MPa of H2, at 160 °C).

3 Conclusions
The novel Ni-MFC catalysts were prepared by simply pyrolysis of
one Ni-based MOF in our report, which can orient the reaction in the
direction of hydrogenation and avoid the processes of ring opening,
hydrodecarboxylation, and hydrodeoxygenation. Notably, we can control
the degree of hydrogenation of furfural by altering the calcination
temperature. Ni-MFC-500 affords us with 92.5% conversion of furfural
and 59.5% selectivity of FOL. Ni-MFC-700 can promote hydrogenation
of furfural with 91.8% conversion and 51.0% selectivity of THFOL.

4.2 Catalyst Preparation
The 2D Ni-based
MOF ([Ni(tia)(H2O)2]n) was synthesized according to the literature.37 The as-synthesized Ni-based MOFs were put into a quartz
boat and placed in the tubular furnace. With the calcination temperature
of 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C under a nitrogen
flow (50 mL/min) for 4 h, the Ni-MFC-300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700,
and 800 catalysts were obtained, respectively.

4.3 Catalytic Tests
The hydrogenation
of furfural was carried out in 100 mL Parr stainless autoclave equipped
with a heater and a mechanical stirrer. Furfural (0.1 g), catalyst
(0.025 g), and methanol (15 mL) were placed in the reactor. After
being purged with nitrogen several times to eliminate the air, H2 was purged into the reactor four times at room temperature
to replace N2. Then, the autoclave was pressurized with
hydrogen up to 2 MPa and heated to 160 °C under vigorous stirring
at 550 rpm and retained for 4 h. After the reaction was over, the
reaction mixture was weighed and diluted with acetonitrile. The products
were qualitatively analyzed by using an Agilent 7890A/5975C gas chromatography–mass
spectrometer equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and quantitatively
determined using GC (Agilent 7820A) employing a FID and a HP-5 capillary
column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 mm). The carrier gas used
was N2 at a flow of 2 mL/min.

4.4 Recycling Tests
Recycling tests were
performed in the following manner. After each reaction, the catalyst
was recovered by centrifugation, washed with methanol six times, dried,
and then activated at the corresponding temperature. The recycled
catalysts were recharged in the reactor following the same procedure
as described above.
