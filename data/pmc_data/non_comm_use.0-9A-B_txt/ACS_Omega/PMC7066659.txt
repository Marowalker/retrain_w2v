Many researchers reported that a
sigmoid kinetic curve was obtained
in oil transesterification with methanol catalyzed by CaO and gave
different explanations for this formation. In this paper, heterogeneously
catalyzed transesterification of soybean oil with methanol using CaO
has been investigated. The solid catalyst and the liquid reaction
mixture under different reaction time periods were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal the formation
of an S-shape kinetic curve. The appearance of calcium hydroxide,
calcium methoxide, calcium glyceroxide, fatty acid calcium, diglycerides,
and monoglycerides and their contributions to the kinetic curve have
been discussed. The low reaction rate in the induction period can
be attributed to mass transfer in this three-phase system. However,
the formation of surfactants, diglycerides and monoglycerides, promotes
the emulsification of the reaction mixture and numerous emulsion reactors
are generated. These emulsion reactors can improve the contact of
the solid catalyst with the reactants and thus accelerate the reaction.

1 Introduction
Due to the rapid development
of the modern industry and service
industry, the serious problems of environment pollution and energy
crisis force researchers to look for new energy sources. As a new
replacement, biodiesel has the available excellent advantages of renewability,
high octane number, high flash point, good lubricity, low viscosity,
and high biodegradability; meanwhile, it is able to reduce the emissions
of environmental pollutants.1−3 Biodiesel is closer to traditional
diesel than other energy sources, which can be used directly for internal
combustion engines without any transformation. Therefore, many countries
around the world are working on the synthesis of biodiesel.

From the economic point of view, much interest has been focused
on catalysing the vegetable oil transesterification.4−7 These synthesis methods include acid/base catalysis, enzyme catalysis,
and supercritical fluid method, and homogeneous acid/base catalysis
has been widely employed in industrial processes due to the high activity
and affordable price.8−14 However, the acid/base catalysis using homogeneous catalysts still
have several drawbacks: (a) the catalyst cannot be recycled; (b) equipment
should be resistant to strong acids and bases; and (c) waste water
produced during purification and separation will bring about environmental
pollution.15 In contrast, the substitution
of homogeneous catalysts by heterogeneous ones may allow achieving
more efficient and economical biodiesel production processes.16,17 Compared to the solid acid catalyst, solid base catalyst has received
extensive attention due to the fact that it can form a high concentration
of methyl ester in lower temperatures and shorter time periods. Many
kinds of solid base materials, such as an intrinsic solid base, supported
solid base, composite, alkali metal ion exchange zeolite, and anion
exchange resin, have been employed to catalyze this reaction.1,18−25 Among them, CaO is one of the most promising catalysts due to its
low solubility in methanol, low cost, and availability.1,26−28

A sigmoid kinetic curve is usually observed
in heterogeneously
catalyzed transesterification of vegetable oils with methanol using
a CaO catalyst, which is a three-phase reaction system due to the
poor solubility of methanol in oil. The kinetic curve can be divided
into three segments: an initial mass-transfer-controlled segment (slow),
a chemically controlled segment (fast), and a final segment close
to equilibrium (slow).5,29,30 It is known that the interfacial mass-transfer resistance has an
apparent effect on the conversion of oil in this three-phase reaction
system; methanol is in fact not effectively used for the reaction.
There are different opinions proposed for the transition from the
initial mass-transfer-controlled segment to chemically controlled
segment. Many researchers report that other more active Ca species
are generated during transesterification. Arzamendi et al.31 proposed that the real active sites are Ca(OH)2 that are formed from CaO and H2O. Venkat Reddy
et al.32 believed that calcium methoxide
(CaM) is the catalytic active substance since alcohol is readily reactive
with calcium oxide. Kouzu et al.33 and
Esipovich et al.28 reported that calcium
glyceroxide (CaD) was formed during the transesterification of vegetable
oil, which is more active than the CaO catalyst. The formation of
these more active Ca species can accelerate the transesterification
reaction, which potentially contributes to the S-shape kinetic curve.16,34 Likozar et al.30 suggested that the rotational
speed has the most profound influence on the duration of the transport
phenomena-limited region. Some researchers have pointed out that a
soluble substance leached away from calcium oxide during transesterification,
which are rather active and have contribution to the transesterification.35,36 For homogeneously catalyzing oil methanolysis, the S-shape kinetic
curve is ascribed to the change of reaction mixture, i.e., the transition
from two-phase to a single-phase system during the reaction.37

In this paper, the reason for the formation
of the S-shape kinetic
curve, especially for the transition from the initial mass-transfer-controlled
segment to chemically controlled segment, in vegetable oil transesterification
using CaO was investigated. For this purpose, the CaO catalyst and
liquid reaction mixture under different treatments were characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure the conversion
of CaO solid and the change of liquid mixture component. The reaction
result was compared with those on several possibly formed active Ca
species. Also, the mixing state of oil, methanol, and CaO with or
without adding diacylglycerides (DG) and monoacylglycerides (MG) was
studied. Based on the experiments results, the S-shape kinetic curve
should be mainly ascribed to the formation of DG and MG during the
reaction, which function as surfactants to promote the formation of
numerous emulsion reactors and thus decreases the mass transfer effect.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Behavior of Calcium
Oxide
The transesterification of soybean oil with methanol
was carried
out at 343 K using CaO as a catalyst, which has a specific surface
area of 5 m2/g (data not given in tables or figures), and
the reaction result is displayed in Figure 1. CaO shows moderate activity for this transesterification
at 343 K, and the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) yield exceeds 80%
in a 3 h run. Detail observation can find that the kinetic curve is
divided into three segments, with reaction periods from 0 to 0.5 h,
0.5 to 2 h, and 2 to 3 h. The reaction rate has an apparent acceleration
after a 0.5 h run, in agreement with previous reports.16,38 The kinetic curve at 323 K also shows an apparent acceleration after
the 1 h run, and the conversion of soybean oil is lower than that
at 343 K, due to a lower reaction rate. The spent CaO catalyst was
separated out after reaction at 343 K for 3 h and washed with methanol.
After drying, the spent catalyst was also used to catalyze this reaction,
and the reaction result is also shown in Figure 1. The initial conversion rate of soybean
oil on this spent catalyst is apparently higher than that of the fresh
one. It indicated that the active sites in the catalyst have been
changed after transesterification for 3 h.39,40

of FAME as a function of reaction time on CaO at 343 K (●)
or 323 K (▲) and the spent CaO catalyst at 343 K (○)
for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol (catalyst/oil
= 1.5 wt %, methanol/oil = 9:1).

Figure 2 depicts
the effect of water content on the catalytic activity of CaO. The
initial FAME yield shows a little change when water is present in
the reaction mixture, but the yield has an apparent increase in the
1 h run, which is due to the formation of surface OH– species. The FAME yield curves on these water-added reactions are
very similar to those on Ca(OH)2, indicating that CaO is
possibly converted into Ca(OH)2 to catalyze this reaction
if water is present in the reaction mixture. However, the FAME yield
decreases dramatically if 30 mol water per mole CaO is added, which
can be ascribed to the hydrolysis of FAME in the presence of too much
water followed by saponification.41

Figure 2 Yield of FAME
as a function of reaction time on CaO for the transesterification
of soybean oil with methanol containing various amounts of water at
343 K (catalyst/oil = 1.5 wt %, methanol/oil = 9:1).

Figure 3 shows
the
catalytic activities of CaO pretreated by methanol, glycerol, and
their mixture. The FAME yield apparently increases when CaO is pretreated
with methanol at 343 K for 3 h (Figure 3A), and the FAME yield curve is similar to that for
CaM. In fact, this pretreatment procedure is almost the same as that
of CaM synthesis. However, pretreatment of CaO with glycerol or the
mixture of glycerol and methanol decreases the catalytic activity
of CaO (Figure 3B).
Detailed observation can find that the FAME yield decreases with the
increase of glycerol content and the induction period extends accordingly.
It seems to suggest that the formation of byproduct glycerol during
the ester transformation is disadvantageous for the conversion of
oil. On the other hand, the catalytic activity increases when glycerol-treated
CaO is washed with methanol before adding it the reaction mixture,
and the FAME yield curve is very similar to that for CaD. It means
that the pretreatment of CaO with glycerol can generate CaD at least
on the surface of CaO, but the excess glycerol will cover the surface
of CaD and decrease the activity.

time on (A) CaO pretreated
with methanol at 343 K and CaM and (B) CaO pretreated with the glycerol
and methanol containing different amounts of glycerol at 343 K and
CaD for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol at 343
K (catalyst/oil = 1.5 wt %, methanol/oil = 9:1, G/M indicates the
mass ratio of glycerol and methanol, G indicates glycerol, and washed
indicates that pretreated CaO was washed with methanol before reaction).

2.2 Characterizations of Catalysts
Figure 4 depicts
the XRD
patterns of fresh and spent CaO. The XRD pattern of fresh CaO shows
several peaks at 32.4, 37.5, 54.0, 64.3, and 67.5°, which can
be readily assigned to a pure phase of CaO (JCPDS card number 37-1497).
The characteristic peaks of CaO disappear on spent CaO, and some new
diffraction peaks at 8.5, 10.4, and 21.4° are clearly visible,
which can be assigned to the crystalline phase of CaD.42 It indicates that most of CaO is transformed
into CaD with the byproduced glycerol after the reaction.33

Figure 4 XRD patterns of CaD, CaM, and fresh and spent CaO.

To better understand the transformation of CaO
during the transesterification
of soybean oil, the solid catalyst was separated and analyzed by XRD
after reaction for various times, and the result is shown in Figure 5. The characteristic
peaks of Ca(OH)2 at 18.0, 20.8, and 34.1° are visible
in the 0.5 h run, and their intensities almost remain unchange during
the reaction. The characteristic peaks of CaD at 8.4 and 10.3°
appear in the 1.5 h run, and their intensities increase rapidly with
an increase in reaction time. Accordingly, the intensities of characteristic
peaks of CaO decrease and the solid catalyst consists mostly of CaD
after reaction in the 3 h run. It indicates that the CaO catalyst
has been changed during transesterification. Part of CaO particles
are transformed to Ca(OH)2 particles in the initial stage,
and most of them are transformed to CaD in the last stage.

Figure 5 XRD patterns
of CaO collected after transesterification at 343
K for different reaction time periods.

The FT-IR spectra of various Ca species are presented in Figure 6A. It can be found
that FT-IR spectra of CaO, Ca(OH)2, CaM, and CaD have significant
difference in the wavenumber range between 800 and 1600 cm–1. The FT-IR spectrum of CaO shows nearly baseline in this wavenumber
range. The FT-IR spectrum of Ca(OH)2 shows the characteristic
bands at 1423 and 874 cm–1, which can be ascribed
to the O–H deformation vibration of −OH groups bonded
to calcium and the C–O bond, respectively.16 An intense band at 3645 cm–1 corresponding
to the O–H stretching vibration of −OH groups can also
be distinguished from the FT-IR spectrum of Ca(OH)2. The
FT-IR spectrum of CaM shows a strong absorption band at 1054 cm–1 and a weak broad band at 1465 cm–1, which are assigned to the stretching vibration of the C–O
bonds and bending modes of C–H bonds, respectively.28 More bands can be distinguished from the FT-IR
spectrum of CaD; they are the bands assigned to the various bending
modes of C–H bonds (1470, 1446, 1420, 1265, 1230, 946, and
915 cm–1), the bending modes of C–O–H
bonds (1378 and 1308 cm–1), the stretching mode
of C–O bonds (1129 and 1075 cm–1), and the
stretching mode of C–C bonds (860 cm–1).39 Thus, it is easy to distinguish the change of
surface species of the catalyst during the reaction by FT-IR spectra.

Figure 6 FT-IR
spectra of (A) various catalysts and (B) CaO collected after
the transesterification at 343 K for different reaction time periods.

Figure 6B depicts
the change of FT-IR spectra of the CaO catalyst during the transesterification
of soybean oil. The bands at 3645, 1436, and 865 cm–1 appear after reaction for 10 min, demonstrating that Ca(OH)2 is formed at the beginning of the reaction. The intensities
of these bands are enhanced after reaction for 0.5 and 1 h; however,
they decrease in 1.5 h run, which possibly results from the further
transformation or the effect of the formation of other species. The
bands for CaD appear after reaction for 2 h, and their intensities
have no apparent change with reaction time prolonging to 3 h, in agreement
with the above XRD results.

It is surprised to find that the
band at 1054 cm–1 is pronounced when CaO is treated
with methanol at 343 K (CaM),
while it is hardly distinguished from the FT-IR spectrum of the CaO
catalyst during the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol.
It indicates that the presence of soybean oil hinders the formation
of CaM.

2.3 Discussion on the Formation of the S-Shape
Kinetic Curve
During the transesterification of soybean oil,
it can be found that the reaction rate has an apparent change after
the 0.5 h run, showing the S-shape kinetic curve, in agreement with
the previous reports.16,39 Due to the presence of three
phases in the reaction mixture and the porous character of the solids,
most of the researchers ascribe the sigmoid kinetic curves to the
existence of mass transfer limitations for the initial reaction period
followed by a kinetic control for the later period.16,30 To confirm the effect of mass transfer, various stirring speeds
were used for this reaction, and the reaction result is shown in Figure 7. It can be found
that a higher stirring speed results in a faster reaction rate and
hardly any FAME is formed without stirring. It indicates that mass
transfer affects the conversion of oil seriously.30

Figure 7 Yield of FAME as a function of reaction time on CaO under various
stirring speeds for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol
at 343 K (catalyst/oil = 1.5 wt %, methanol/oil = 9:1).

Many researchers ascribe the acceleration of reaction after
the
induction period to the formation of new active species, such as Ca(OH)2, CaM, and CaD.16,28,39 Some even ascribe this to the effect of leaching.35 To estimate the effect of leaching, the reaction mixtures
in 0.5 and 0.9 h runs were centrifuged, respectively, and the liquid
phases were reused for reaction without adding the catalyst. As shown
in Figure 8, the FAME
yields almost keep unchanged on these reaction systems (curves d and
e), indicating that the effect of the leaching effect can be ignored.
López Granados et al.43 also confirmed
that the total homogeneous contribution is much smaller than that
arising from the heterogeneous sites provided that the catalyst loading
is large enough.

Figure 8 Yield of FAME as a function of reaction time on CaO under
different
treatment conditions for the transesterification of soybean oil with
methanol at 343 K. The reaction was first carried out at 343 K for
0.5 h; the solid and liquid reaction mixtures were separated by centrifugation;
and then (a) solid was added to new reactants, (b) liquid reaction
mixture was added to a new CaO catalyst, (c) solid and liquid reaction
mixtures were stirred again for further reaction, (d) liquid reaction
mixture was stirred for further reaction, and (e) liquid reaction
mixture separated from the reaction system in the 0.9 h run was stirred
for further reaction.

Glycerol is the byproduct
of the transesterification of soybean
oil. The pKa of glycerol is 14.15, which
is lower than 15.5 of methanol; thus, it can react with CaO, a solid
strong base. Based on the analysis of the IR spectra, Esipovich et
al.28 have suggested that CaO first reacted
with methanol and caused the formation of CH3O– and OH– groups on the oxide surface, and these
groups were further replaced by glycerol with the formation of a more
stable CaD. CaD exhibits a catalytic performance higher than that
of the commercial CaO.39 It is worth noting
that a higher content of glycerol is needed to generate CaD in this
reaction mixture.33 As shown in XRD patterns
(Figure 5) and FT-IR
spectra (Figure 6),
most of the CaO is transformed into CaD in the 2 h run; however, hardly,
any CaD can be distinguished in the 1 h run due to the lower content
of glycerol, in agreement with Kouzu’s report.33 It indicated that the acceleration of reaction after the
0.5 h run results not from the formation of CaD. CaM also shows higher
initial activity than that of CaO in this transesterification, and
it can be formed by a reaction between CaO and methanol at 343 K.
However, the existence of soybean oil seriously hinders the formation
of CaM and hardly any signal of CaM is observed in the XRD patterns
or IR spectra of the catalyst in the 0.5 or 1 h run. Different from
CaD and CaM, the results from IR spectra and XRD patterns show that
Ca(OH)2 is formed at the beginning of the reaction and
preserved during the reaction. The formation Ca(OH)2 possibly
results from the reaction of CaO with the trace water in reactants.
However, although the yield of FAME on Ca(OH)2 is higher
than that on CaO in the 1 h run, the yield of FAME on both catalysts
is similar in the 0.5 h run and the induction period is still present
in the kinetic curve (Figure 2). Moreover, as shown in Figure 8, the catalyst after the 0.5 h run was separated
and reused for the reaction; the catalytic activity and tendency are
similar to those on fresh CaO (curve a). It indicates that the acceleration
of reaction after the induction period results not from the conversion
of CaO to other active species.

It is worth noting that the
induction period disappears when the
reaction mixture in the 0.5 h run was separated by centrifugation
and remixed for reaction, and the FAME yield in next 0.5 h run is
similar to the original result in 1 h run (curve c in Figure 8). Moreover, if the liquid
reaction mixture was used for reaction with the new CaO catalyst,
the induction period also disappears (curve b in Figure 8). It indicates that the composition
of the liquid reaction mixture has been changed after the 0.5 h run.
Csernica et al.37 has investigated the
homogeneous catalyzed oil methanolysis by KOH and found that soybean
oil is actually soluble in methanol and the rate of mass transfer
and the equilibrium concentration of oil in methanol increases with
an increase in methyl ester concentration. Thus, they ascribe the
S-shape kinetic curve to the transition from a two-phase to a single-phase
system in this homogeneous reaction due to the formation of methyl
esters. However, the yield of methyl esters is about 3.4% in the 0.5
h run using CaO as the catalyst, which is too low to improve the solubility
of oil in methanol apparently. As shown in Figure 9, the initial activity has hardly any change
when 3.4% of methyl esters is directly added into the reaction system
before the reaction, which shows the evidence that the acceleration
of reaction after induction period derives not from the formation
of methyl esters during the reaction.

Figure 9 Yield of FAME as a function of reaction
time on CaO for the transesterification
of soybean oil with methanol at 343 K in the presence of 7% of DG
and MG (○), 3.4% of methyl esters (Δ), 1% of glycerol
(x), and 7% of P123 (□) (catalyst/oil = 1.5 wt %, methanol/oil
= 9:1).

Fatty acid calcium is one of the
possible compositions in the liquid
reaction mixture, which can be produced via neutralization of the
catalyst by free fatty acid (FFA) or saponification during the transesterification
of soybean oil.44 Unlike waste frying oils,
the content of FFA is usually around 0.2% in soybean oil and the effect
of the neutralization can be ignored. It has been reported that the
saponification of the FAME molecules and glycerides happens simultaneously
during the transesterification of triglycerides (TG) catalyzed by
CaO itself.45 The FAME formation rate is
faster than that for Ca soap formation, and the total content of Ca2+ in the ester and alcoholic phases is only 0.13 wt %, compared
to more than 90% of the FAME yield.46 The
yield of FAME is only 3.4% in the 0.5 h run, and thus, the formation
of Ca soap is very limited at this time. Puna et al.44 have reported that the S-shape kinetic curve is still present
using waste frying oils as a reactant, which has a content of FFA
of 3.7%. It indicates that the formation of a small amount of fatty
acid calcium would not accelerate the transesterification reaction.
In fact, the formation of fatty acid calcium should be responsible
for the deactivation of the CaO catalyst.

It is worth noting
that MG and DG are also formed in this transesterification
reaction.47 The boiling points of these
molecules are too high to be detected by GC, and thus, the reaction
mixtures are also analyzed by HPLC.

Figure 10 depicts
the HPLC chromatographs of the reaction mixtures at different time
periods. Generally, four groups of peaks can be distinguished in the
HPLC chromatographs of the reaction mixtures; they are peaks in the
region between 0 and 4 min attributed to MG and free fatty acids,
between 4 and 6 min attributed to methyl esters, between 6 and 12
min attributed to DG, and longer than 20 min attributed to TG.48 It can be found that methyl esters (FAME), MG
and DG, are formed at the beginning of the reaction. The content of
methyl eaters increases along the reaction, in agreement with the
GC results. While the content of DG and MG reaches maximum in 1 h
run, it decreases with the further reaction. The ratios of these products
at different reaction time periods are shown in Figure 11. It can be found that both
the ratios of DG/FAME and (DG + MG)/FAME reach maximum after 0.5 h
run, and they are much higher than 1. It is thus very possible that
the formation of DG and MG, especially DG, has more significant effect
on the reaction rate than methyl esters at the beginning of the reaction.
As shown in Figure 9, the induction period disappears when the DG and MG, which share
the same amount as that generated in the 0.5 h run from HPLC quantitative
analysis, are added into the reaction system, and the FAME yield in
the 0.5 h run is very similar to the original result in the 1 h run.
Therefore, the formation of MG and DG should be responsible for the
acceleration of reaction rate, i.e., the formation of the S-shape
kinetic curve.

reaction
time periods for the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol
on CaO (catalyst/oil = 1.5 wt %, methanol/oil = 9:1).

Figure 11 Ratios of different products and yields of DG and MG as a function
of reaction time on CaO for the transesterification of soybean oil

López Granados et al.49,50 have reported that
forming a slurry by mixing CaO with biodiesel results in both protection
against poisoning by atmospheric CO2 and H2O
and an increase in reaction rate. They ascribe it to the presence
of minute amounts of MG and/or DG in biodiesel, and the transesterification
of MG and DG during the pretreatment with methanol results in the
release of glycerol, which then reacts with the catalyst surface,
resulting in the formation of very active surface CaD species. Thus,
a few minutes are needed to treat the slurry with methanol before
proceeding with the transesterification reaction. In the present study,
as discussed above, hardly any CaD can be detected on the solid catalyst
in the 0.5 h run and the solid catalyst after the 0.5 h run shows
an activity similar to that of fresh CaO. Moreover, when 0.37 g of
glycerol (∼1 wt % of oil added), which is higher than the theoretical
value of glycerol produced in the 0.5 h run, was added into the reaction
mixture, the FAME yield in 0.5 h run was still lower than 5% (Figure 9). It fully indicates
that the formation of CaD by a reaction of DG or/and MG with methanol
is not the main reason for the acceleration of the transesterification
reaction after the 0.5 h run.

Both the hydrophobic long-chain
alkyl and hydrophilic carboxyl
groups are present on DG and MG molecules, and they are typical surfactants.
It is well known that adding a surfactant is advantageous in mixing
water and oil, and thus, it is very possible that the formation of
DG and MG improves the mixing of soybean oil and methanol.51 As shown in Figure 12, certain amounts of soybean oil and methanol
were evenly added to two glass tubes; the left tube also contains
small amounts of DG and MG. Both of tubes were shaken for 1 min, followed
by standing for a long time. It can be found that the methanol and
soybean oil are separated completely in 10 min without adding DG and
MG. However, the methanol and soybean oil are hardly separated after
adding DG and MG; the oil phase (lower phase) is still turbid even
after 24 h standing. It indicates that the presence of DG and MG promotes
the formation and maintaining of the emulsion. On the other hand,
the volume of the upper phase (methanol) decreases after separation,
indicating more methanol molecules are dissolved into soybean oil
in the presence of DG and MG. Figure 12 also shows the dispersion state of CaO in oil and
methanol with or without adding DG and MG. It can be found that CaO
is dispersed in oil rather than methanol by stirring. Without adding
DG/MG, methanol is quickly separated from the oil phase; however,
the separation rate decreases dramatically when DG/MG is added; almost
half of methanol locates in the oil phase in emulsion morphology after
standing for 10 min.

and without (right) adding DG/MG (a–c). Both mixtures were
shaken vigorously for 1 min, followed by standing for 10 min (a),

methanol, and CaO with (left) and without (right) adding DG/MG (d–f).
Both mixtures were shaken vigorously for 1 min, followed by standing
for 2 min (d), 5 min (e), and 10 min (f).

Moreover, photomicrographs of the stable oil phase further confirmed
the existence of the emulsion. As shown in Figure 13, occasionally, one bubble with a diameter
of around 40 μm can be seen in the visual field of pure oil
after shaking for 1 min followed by standing for 0.5 h, and the bubble
almost disappears after 1 h standing. A spherical bubble or droplet
is also seldom observed in the oil phase of the oil–methanol
mixture upon similar treatment, indicating that droplets of methanol
in oil phase are unstable. However, many spherical liquid droplets
with diameters ranging from 1.9 to 11.7 μm exist in the oil
phase of the oil–methanol mixture containing DG/MG, even after
standing for 1 h. Since DG and MG are completely dissolved in oil
in our condition, the droplets should derive from methanol, which
is consistent with the decrease of the methanol volume upon this treatment
(Figure 12). If CaO
was added to the mixture of oil and methanol, many irregular solid
particles ranging from 3.9 to 19 μm would be observed in the
oil phase even after standing for 1 h, as shown in Figure 13d. It indicates that the dispersion
of small CaO particles in oil is stable. However, few spherical liquid
droplets can be observed after 0.5 h standing, indicating that the
presence of CaO did not improve the dispersion of methanol in oil.
In the case of the mixture consisting of oil, methanol, DG/MG, and
CaO, plenty of spherical droplets and irregular solid particles can
be observed after 0.5 or 1 h standing, indicating that a large amount
of CaO catalysts and methanol is present in soybean oil. More importantly,
many of the methanol droplets and CaO particles contact with each
other and thus a number of emulsion reactors are generated. Therefore,
the mixing state of oil, methanol, and CaO is greatly improved in
the presence of DG/MG.

At the beginning of the reaction, the reaction mixture contains
a few DG/MG, the CaO catalyst locates in the soybean oil phase, and
the dispersion state of methanol in the oil phase is poor, which seriously
hinders the contact of methanol with CaO. Thus, the transesterification
rate is low in the initial reaction period on the CaO catalyst. However,
DG and MG are formed in the 0.5 h run, which greatly improve the mixing
state of reactants and the solid catalyst. Numerous emulsion reactors
are generated in the reaction system, in which both the liquid reactants
can well contact with the CaO solid, and thus, the effect of mass
transfer is decreased. Therefore, the reaction is accelerated in the
0.5 h run.

It should be noted that the induction period can
hardly distinguished
from the FAME yield curve on the spent catalyst. As discussed above,
this spent catalyst comprises mainly of CaD. Although the specific
surface area of CaD (4 m2/g) is similar to that of CaO
(5 m2/g) (data not given in tables or figures), a particular
interaction between glyceroxide and calcium ions is present on the
CaD catalyst, which creates a surface with hydrophobic and hydrophilic
sites and a hydrogen bond network favouring the approach of methanol
and triglyceride molecules.39 Lukić
et al.52 have reported that the presence
of CaD as a catalyst in methanolysis of sunflower oil led to the formation
of a more stable oil–methanol emulsion. They compared the mixing
state of oil and methanol in the presence of commercial CaO and CaD,
by shaking vigorously the mixture followed by standing for various
times, and found that the methanol phase occurred already after 10
min when CaO was used, while the cloudiness texture of the oil phase
was observed in the case of CaD. This result is similar to the effect
of adding DG/MG, the mass transfer is depressed, and thus the spent
catalyst and CaD show almost no induction period in their kinetic
curves.52 P123 is a kind of nonionic surfactant
with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. As shown in Figure 9, the induction period
is also disappeared in the presence of P123 and the FAME yield at
0.5 h with P123 is even higher than that with DG/MG. It gives a further
evidence of the promotion effect of surfactants in this three-phase
reaction system.

3 Conclusions
The
heterogeneously catalyzed transesterification of soybean oil
with methanol using CaO presents an S-shape kinetic curve. The low
reaction rate in the induction period derives mainly from the mass
transfer since a three-phase system is used for this transesterification.
DG and MG are formed at the beginning of the reaction, which are mainly
responsible for the acceleration of the reaction rate after the 0.5
h run. These intermediates (MG and DG) function as surfactants to
promote the formation of numerous emulsion reactors, which are helpful
to the contact of the solid catalyst with liquid reactants, and thus
decrease the effect of mass transfer.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
CaO was purchased from
Shanghai Chemical Reagent, China, which was calcined at 973 K for
3 h in N2 flow and then cooled to room temperature in a
N2 atmosphere prior to use. Methanol (HPLC) and glycerol
(A.R.) were supplied by Nanjing Chemical Reagent, China. DG and MG
were supplied by Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd., China.
C16H33COOCH3 was supplied by Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (TCI), Japan. Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene
glycol) (P123, Mn = 1100) was obtained
from Aldrich. The biodiesel for the treatment was obtained by methanolysis
of soybean oil. CaM was prepared by reacting CaO with methanol. The
methanol and calcined CaO at a molar ratio of 40 were treated at 343
K for 3 h with a reflux condenser. Then, the filtered solid was dried
at 373 K in N2 flow. CaD was obtained by treating calcined
CaO with 4 times more glycerol, using methamol as solvent. The typical
procedure was similar to the synthesis of CaM, and the excess glycerol
was removed by washing with methanol before drying. Ca(OH)2 was prepared by the reaction of calcined CaO with excess water at
room temperature for 12 h and dried at 373 K in N2 flow.

4.2 Catalyst Characterizations
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-RA
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from
10 to 80°. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ALPHA infrared
spectrometer operated in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. The
number of scans was set at 64 with a resolution of 2 cm–1, over the range 4000–600 cm–1. The solid
catalyst after reaction at different time periods was filtered and
washed with methanol and acetic ether to remove any liquid compounds
that were physically absorbed on the solid and dried at 373 K in N2 flow. Adsorption of N2 was measured at 77 K using
a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. Prior to testing, the sample was
evacuated at 573 K for 4 h.53 The specific
surface area was calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation with adsorption data in the relative pressure range
from 0.05 to 0.3. The photomicrographs of the dispersion of methanol
and/or CaO in oil phase were taken by a JS94H micro-electrophoresis
meter. Certain amounts of methanol, oil, DG/MG, and CaO, with the
same ratio for the transesterification reaction, were shaken vigorously
for 1 min and allowed to stand for 0.5 and 1.0 h before observation.
The magnification factor of the lens is 4.32 pixel/μm.

4.3 Transesterification of Soybean Oil with Methanol
The
transesterification of soybean oil with methanol was performed
in a 250 mL two-necked flask with a reflux condenser and a magnetic
stirrer under atmospheric pressure, and the repeated measurements
showed the error of yield within 3%. Typically, 12 g of methanol and
35.5 g of soybean oil (methanol/oil molar ratio is 9:1) were placed
in the flask. Then, 0.56 g of catalyst, which had been calcined at
973 K for 3 h in N2 flow, was added into the mixture and
heated by a water bath at 343 K at a stirring speed of 1200 rpm. At
the intervals of 0.5 h, a few amounts of reaction mixture were withdrawn
and extracted with 0.1 M HCl and water to remove methanol and catalyst.16 After centrifugation, the upper liquid (FAME
and unreacted soybean oil) and methyl heptadecanoate/n-hexane solution were mixed. With the internal standard method using
gas chromatography (GC), the FAME yield was calculated by  

Here, ∑yiAi is the corrected peak area of the FAMEs, AMH is the peak area of methyl heptadecanoate, yi is the correction factor of each methyl ester,
and m and mMH are the
masses of upper mixed liquid and methyl heptadecanoate, respectively.

Pretreatments of CaO with methanol and glycerol in methanol were
carried out as follows: 0.56 g of calcined CaO was placed in a 50
mL two-necked flask and 12 g of methanol containing various amounts
of glycerol was added into the flask. After 3 h of stirring at 343
K, 35.5 g of soybean oil was added to perform the transesterification.
Pretreatment of CaO with glycerol was carried out as follows: 0.56
g calcined CaO was placed in a 50 mL two-necked flask, and 3.82 g
glycerol was added into the flask. After 3 h of stirring at 343 K,
12 g methanol and 35.5 g soybean oil were added to perform the transesterification.
For comparison, the pretreated CaO catalysts were also washed with
methanol, filtered and dried at 373 K in flowing of N2.
The resulting solid was then added to the mixture of 12 g methanol
and 35.5 g soybean oil for the transesterification.

HPLC was
used to detect the presence of the fatty acid (FA), MG,
DG, triglycerides (TG), and the methyl esters using a Agilent 1260
Infinity II equipped with a UV–vis detector, 6120 quadrupole
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) system, and Poroshell
120 EC-C18 column (2.7 μm) (3 × 150 mm2). The
samples were diluted with a 10% solution of 5:4 (v/v) isopropyl alcohol/hexane.
HPLC-grade methanol was used in line A, and a solution of 5:4 (v/v)
isopropyl alcohol/hexane was used in line B. The elution was performed
isocratically with 90% A and 10% B at 50 °C, with a flow rate
of 1 mL/min, and the wavelength was set to 205 nm.48
