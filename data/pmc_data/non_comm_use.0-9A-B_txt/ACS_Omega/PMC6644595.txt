Aerosol particle filtration in most
penetrating particle size (MPPS)
region is of great challenge for conventional nonwoven filter mats.
The present work, therefore, redesigns conventional filter mats by
introducing porous structure. A combination of thermally induced phase
separation and breath figure mechanism was employed to synthesize
porous cellulose triacetate fibers, in conjunction with the volatile
solvent methylene chloride. The ambient humidity, the concentration
of the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) secondary polymer, and the ethanol
cosolvent were all adjusted to modify the Taylor cone formation, jet
stability, and fiber porosity. After fiber formation, the PVP was
removed to obtain a superhydrophobic material. To distinguish the
effect of pores, the performance of porous and nonporous nanofibers
having similar sizes was conducted. Tests were performed using various
dust particle sizes, and the results show that the collection efficiency
of the porous fibers, resulting from particle diffusion, inertial
impaction, and interception, was improved. Interestingly, the efficiency
of the porous fibers in the MPPS region was exceptionally enhanced
(up to 95%), demonstrating that the presence of dynamic pores greatly
contributes to particle capture.

1 Introduction
The
use of electrospun nonwoven fiber mats with high specific surface
areas could lead to greatly improved performance in many different
applications, including biotechnology membranes, air filtration, sensors,
tissue engineering and repairs, drug delivery, and solar and fuel
cells.1−7 Unlike conventional rigid porous structures, these porous structures
made from nonwoven fibers mats are dynamic systems in which both pore
size and shape can change.8,9 Multilevel-structured
fibers mats are also attractive because they offer additional heterogeneous
interfaces that can play important roles in a variety of practical
applications.10,11

Many researchers have successfully
fabricated nonwoven porous fiber
mats from various polymers by a number of different methods, including
electrospinning.12,13 The filtration performance for
a particle size >0.25 μm has also been reported. However,
a
lack of information regarding the structure–performance relationship
in such porous fibers remains an obstacle, particularly in the most
penetrating particle size (MPPS) region of the filtration evaluation.
It is also not clear to what extent the aerosol filtration performance
is enhanced by the presence of pores or the formation of nanofiber.
For these reasons, the present study examined the correlations between
porous structure and aerosol filtration performance through various
filtration mechanisms.

Cellulose triacetate (CTA) was chosen
for this work because it
is superhydrophobic and thus suitable for aerosol particle filtration
and can also be dissolved in highly volatile solvents such as methylene
chloride (MC).14 A combination of thermally
induced phase-separation and the breath-figure mechanism was employed
to fabricate test specimens. In addition, ethanol (EtOH) was used
as a cosolvent to control the MC evaporation rate so that polymer
stretching could be achieved.15,16 Because porous and
nonporous (NP) fibers were compared, this investigation is expected
to improve our understanding of the structure–property relationship
in terms of aerosol filtration performance. Various sizes of dust
particles were employed to carefully evaluate the filtering ability,
based on particle diffusion, inertial impaction, and interception,
and the MPPS region.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphologies of CTA Nanofibers and Effects
of CTA Concentration and Humidity
The electrospinning characteristics
of a polymer are affected by its physical properties, including electrical
conductivity, surface tension, and viscosity.17,18 Solvent selection is also important in determining the formation
of a Taylor cone and in adjusting the polymer elongation.19 A low boiling-point solvent will evaporate rapidly
(almost immediately after ejection from the needle), thus restricting
polymer elongation and leading to either a clogged needle or a scattered
Taylor cone.14 In contrast, a high viscosity
precursor can slow the evaporation of the solvent. Therefore, finding
the appropriate balance between the solvent evaporation rate and the
viscosity of the polymer precursor is vital to obtain well-structured
fibers.

Polymer precursors with various concentrations of CTA
and solvent of MC/EtOH ratios (vol/vol) of 90/10 were evaluated. The
viscosities of the polymer precursors were found to increase in proportion
to the CTA concentration, with values of 21, 101, and 305 cp for 3,
5, and 7 wt % CTA, respectively. As shown in Figure 1a–c, the morphology of the electrospun
precursor was transformed from dented surface particles to beaded
fibers and finally to fibers with dented surfaces, as the CTA concentration
was increased from 3 to 5 to 7 wt %, respectively. Interestingly,
the viscosity of the precursor affected not only the final morphology
of the spun product but also the surface pattern. The dents were broadened,
and the number of dents were reduced when a higher viscosity precursor
was used, likely because of the decreased solvent evaporation rate.

Figure 1 Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of CTA spun at a relative
humidity of 35% from solutions containing (a) 3, (b) 5, and (c) 7
wt % CTA, at a relative humidity of 50% from solutions containing
(d) 3, (e) 5, and (f) 7 wt % CTA, and at a relative humidity of 70%
from solutions containing (g) 3, (h) 5, and (i) 7 wt % CTA, respectively.
Polymer precursors were made using MC/EtOH ratios (vol/vol) of 90/10
as the solvent.

Porous structures were
formed because of a combination of thermally
induced phase separation and the breath figure mechanism. In this
type of process, rapid solvent evaporation rapidly decreases the temperature
at the surface of the jet. Once phase separation occurs, the evaporation
of the solvent-rich phase (i.e., the polymer-poor phase) leaves behind
voids that result in the formation of pores along the fiber.12,20−24 Subsequently, ambient water vapor tends to condense on the cool
surface of the polymer jet and forms into droplets as the surface
temperature is further decreased, leaving porous imprints after the
water evaporates.25−27 Therefore, at a high polymer concentration, the number
of dents was decreased because the temperature drop at the surface
of the jet was not as extreme and only a small number of water droplets
condensed. Delayed evaporation will also result in a higher solvent
content in the jet, meaning that improved elongation can be obtained.
Therefore, the dented surface was stretched during elongation to form
long dimples with a shallow pattern. As a result, some of the electrospun
fibers had a twisted appearance.

Employing a high humidity environment
during electrospinning can
also increase the extent of water vapor condensation.5,19 To evaluate this effect, relative humidity values of 35, 50, and
70% were used to synthesize porous CTA fibers. Figure 1a,d,g demonstrates that the depth of the
surface pattern was increased to form pores as the humidity was increased.
Furthermore, the number of pores was increased, and these pores were
uniformly distributed over the surfaces of the electrospun fibers.
This phenomenon was also observed when using a high-viscosity polymer
precursor. A higher pore concentration on the beads was obtained from
a precursor containing 5 wt % CTA, whereas dented surfaces were present
on the surfaces of fibers prepared from a precursor containing 7 wt
% CTA, as can be seen in Figure 1.

2.2 Size-Controlled CTA Fibers
by Secondary Polymer
Addition
The final morphology of the electrospun fibers is
significantly affected by the elongation of the polymeric precursor
and by the amount of water vapor condensed on the jet surface. In
particular, the ambient humidity determines the quantity of pores
on the fiber surfaces, although pores will only form on exposed surfaces
such as the exteriors of spherical particles and beads. In contrast,
pores are typically not found on the fiber surfaces, likely because
there is not enough space for phase separation and because the solvent
rapidly evaporates from these thin surfaces, meaning that water vapor
does not have time to occupy the fiber jet surface before the solvent
evaporates and a solid fiber is formed. Therefore, secondary polymer
addition, which can tune the Taylor cone shape and postpone the solvent
evaporation, is extremely helpful in this process. A hydrophilic polymer
such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is optimal, especially if this
polymer can be obtained in a variety of molecular weights to allow
adjustment of the polymer precursor viscosity. This approach tends
to prevent the formation of beads, and employing PVP also promotes
the condensation of water vapor on the surface of the jet and slows
solvent evaporation, as is evident from Supporting Information Figure S1.

On the basis of the polymer precursor
viscosity after PVP addition, a solution containing 5 wt % CTA was
selected for the fabrication of the composite fibers. This precursor
was predicted to allow the formation of narrow composites with a definitive
pore morphology. Figure 2 presents SEM images showing the effects of the PVP molecular weight
on the porous morphology. It is evident that pores were uniformly
formed on the surfaces of the beads and fibers upon adding the PVP.
These pores tended to form cylindrical and slit shapes as a result
of water evaporation during elongation of the polymeric fibers.5 The application of a high voltage to the collector
plate resulted in the precursor experiencing a strong attractive force,
leading to significant elongation and therefore stretching the pores
from spherical to oval shapes. The porous morphology was also affected
by the molecular weight of the PVP, as shown in Figure 2a–d. The pores were lengthened as
the PVP molecular weight was increased, with values of approximately
180 and 235 nm for the 10 and 40 kDa PVP, respectively. The addition
of the highest molecular weight PVP (1300 kDa) formed long, slit-shaped,
shallow pores. The PVP tended to reach the surface of the jet and
the higher molecular-weight-producing longer pores. Furthermore, the
1300 kDa PVP slowed the solvent evaporation rate and therefore promoted
the formation of shallow pores.

Figure 2 SEM images of porous fibers before immersion
in 80 °C water
for 3 h, prepared at a relative humidity of 70% from polymer precursors
containing MC/EtOH ratios (vol/vol) of 90/10 as the solvent, 5 wt
% CTA, and (a) 0 wt % PVP, (b) 2 wt % 10 kDa PVP, (c) 2 wt % 40 kDa
PVP, and (d) 2 wt % 1300 kDa PVP. SEM images of porous fibers after
immersion, made with the addition of (e) 0 wt % PVP, (f) 2 wt % 10
kDa PVP, (g) 2 wt % 40 kDa PVP, and (h) 2 wt % 1300 kDa PVP.

Pure CTA fibers are required for
filtration applications, and therefore
the prepared fibers were purified by immersion process prior to filtration
trials. The fiber and pore morphologies did not show any significant
changes after the immersion process, as shown in Figure 2e–h. Using the low and
medium molecular-weight PVP, the lengths of the pores were increased
from 180 and 235 to 250 and 285 nm, whereas the fiber diameters were
slightly decreased from 780 and 850 to 630 and 710 nm, respectively.
These results confirm that the PVP migrated and accumulated on the
surfaces of the spun fibers.

Figure 3 demonstrates
that the porosity of the nanofibers was increased in proportion to
the concentration of PVP, up to 2 wt %. However, at a higher concentration
of PVP (i.e., 3 wt %), the porosity of the CTA nanofibers was significantly
decreased because the solvent could not evaporate rapidly.

Figure 3 SEM images
showing the effects of PVP concentration and molecular
weight on porous morphology before immersion, applying a relative
humidity of 70% in conjunction with 5 wt % CTA. High-resolution images
are included as insets.

The PVP removal process evidently altered the porous structure,
such that the pore diameters were decreased while the lengths were
increased, as can be seen in Supporting Information Figure S2. This effect is attributed to stretching of the polymer
when immersed in water during the PVP removal process. The PVP was
firmly attached to the surfaces of the CTA fibers, including the pore
surfaces, and so as it slowly dissolved in the water, it pulled at
the fiber surfaces to create a stretching force that altered the porous
morphology.

2.3 Size-Controlled CTA Fibers
by Co-Solvent Addition
The other factor that may affect the
morphology of the fibers is
the solvent. To determine the boundary conditions at which porous
or NP fibers would be obtained, various EtOH/MC volume ratios were
evaluated using a precursor solution containing 5 wt % CTA and 2 wt
% 10 kDa PVP. Figure 4a–e shows that the porosity was inversely proportional to
the EtOH concentration in the precursor. A polymer precursor made
using 100 vol % MC produced a highly porous ribbon fiber. During this
trial, a skin was formed after the jet left the needle and the MC
was evaporated, after which the tube formed by the skin collapsed
under atmospheric pressure to produce a wide, flat, ribbonlike fiber.13,28 In addition, pores were formed from the imprints of the evaporating
solvent and water vapor.

Figure 4 SEM images of spun polymers obtained from precursors
containing
5 wt % CTA and 2 wt % 10 kDa PVP at a relative humidity of 70%, with
MC/EtOH ratios (vol/vol) of (a,f) 100/0, (b,g) 95/5, (c,h) 90/10,
(d,i) 85/15, and (e,j) 80/20, both (a–e) before immersion and
(f–j) after immersion.

The addition of EtOH reduced the evaporation rate of the
solvent,
and mixtures of spiny, porous ribbons and straight porous nanofibers
were formed when using 5 vol % EtOH in the precursor. Increasing the
EtOH concentration to 10 vol % produced solely the straight porous
nanofibers. In this case, the formation of hollow shells that subsequently
collapsed did not occur because there was no sudden solvent evaporation.
The addition of a higher EtOH concentration further slowed the solvent
evaporation, and therefore straight fibers were also obtained from
solvents containing 15 and 20 vol % EtOH. Pores could not be observed
in these fibers because the slow evaporation of the solvent prevented
phase separation. In the case of porous fiber, Figure 4f–h confirms that the pores were increased
in size following the immersion process. Whereas, in the case of straight
fiber, pores still cannot be observed even after immersion process,
as shown in Figure 4i,j. It confirms that the high concentration of EtOH produced dense
fiber.

2.4 Aerosol Filtration Performance of Nonwoven
CTA Fiber Mats
The effects of pore formation on the fiber
surfaces on the filtration performance have not yet been studied in
detail. To date, the performance of mats with and without pores has
been examined without considering the size of the fibers. Generally,
porous fibers will have a much smaller diameter compared to NP fibers
when prepared using the same concentration of polymer because of the
low viscosity of the polymer precursor and the rapid evaporation of
the solvent. However, it is unclear whether collection efficiency
is improved because of the smaller fiber diameter or the presence
of pores. Therefore, in this study, fibers having similar sizes were
prepared and assessed to confirm the effect of pores.

Aerosol
particle permeation tests and pressure-drop measurements were performed
using multilayer air filters composed of straight microfiber mats
and nanostructured CTA fibers, employing an atmosphere containing
dust particles with diameters in the range of 0.03–0.3 μm.
Various particle-capture mechanisms, including diffusion, MPPS, interception,
and inertial impaction could be investigated by varying the size of
the dust.

Because the multilayer filters were quite inhomogeneous,
the basis
weights of the filters were used as a parameter in these trials. As
noted, the basis weight was 3.35–3.54 g m–2. It has been widely reported that the filtration performance is
greatly affected by the filter morphology, particularly by the fiber
diameter. In the present study, we found that the presence of pores
on the surfaces of single fibers enhanced the aerosol filtration performance,
as shown in Figure 5a,b. Interestingly, filter mats containing porous fibers exhibited
outstanding particle-collection efficiency for all dust particle sizes,
even within the MPPS region. Generally, particle collection efficiency
at MPPS region is less than 85%, even for filter-containing nanofiber.3 However, with the introduction of porous fiber,
values of approximately 95 and 93% were obtained at face velocities
of 1.4 and 5.3 cm s–1, respectively. The particle
capture efficiencies via the diffusion mechanism were also exceptional,
with values as high as 99 and 99.5% for face velocities of 1.4 and
5.3 cm s–1, respectively. The interception and inertial
impaction mechanism also resulted in very high efficiencies of approximately
97% for both face velocities. These values were about 18% higher than
the efficiencies obtained with NP fibers having the same diameter.

at a face velocity of (a) 5.3 and (b) 1.4 cm s–1. (c) N2 ADS–DES isotherms of porous and NP fibers
prepared from precursors containing 5 wt % CTA and 2 wt % 10 kDa PVP.
Monolayer gas ADS data are included as an inset to (c).

The parameters of porous and NP multilayer filters,
including size
distribution, filter thickness, and solid volume fraction were similar,
as shown in Supporting Information Figure
S3 and Table S1. Therefore, it can be concluded that the improved
aerosol particle collection efficiency noted above can likely be attributed
to the presence of pores on the entire surfaces of single nanofibers,
which nearly doubled the surface area of the fibers.29 The surface areas of the porous and NP fibers were determined
using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method and found to
be approximately 23.5 and 14.3 m2 g–1, respectively. The N2 adsorption (ADS)–desorption
(DES) curves in Figure 5c indicate that both the porous and NP fibers generated type-II isotherm
curves, indicating that they were macroporous materials. In the case
of the NP fibers, the macropores are ascribed to voids between nonwoven
fibers. In contrast, the macropores on the porous fibers are composed
of both pores on the surfaces of single fibers and voids among nonwoven
fibers. The NP fibers produced a much wider hysteresis gap than that
of the porous fibers, equivalent to type H2 hysteresis.30 This hysteresis reflects the delayed condensation
and pore blocking/percolation effects because of the presence of a
disordered pore network within the nonwoven mat. In the case of the
porous fibers, hysteresis was not observed, indicating that the pores
were completely accessible as a result of the channels formed on the
surfaces of single fibers.

A packing filter containing porous
nanofibers generated a pressure
drop on the order of 140 Pa, close to twice that obtained using the
NP fibers (65 Pa). This result can likely be attributed to the large
number of dust particles that were collected and eventually blocked
the pores of the fibers.

3 Conclusions
The
synthesis of porous CTA nanofibers via electrospinning was
evaluated in detail, using thermally induced phase separation and
the breath figure mechanism in conjunction with MC. Ambient humidity
and the concentrations of the PVP secondary polymer and EtOH cosolvent
were adjusted to control the fiber diameter and porosity. The PVP
was subsequently removed by immersing the fibers in warm water to
prevent morphological change of fiber during filtration application.
Porous and NP fibers having similar sizes were compared to elucidate
the effect of pores on aerosol filtration performance. Trials with
a variety of dust particle sizes demonstrated that the porous fiber
particle-capture efficiencies based on particle diffusion, inertial
impaction, and interception were superior. The efficiency of the porous
fibers within the MPPS region was also significantly improved (to
95%), providing evidence that the presence of dynamic pores can greatly
improve particle capture.

4 Methods
4.1 Electrospinning
to Produce Nonwoven Fibers
Mats
Precursor solutions were made by dissolving CTA (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA) and PVP (Mw = 10, 40,
or 1300 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), as a secondary polymer,
in mixtures of MC and EtOH (containing 0–20 vol % EtOH). These
solutions were used to prepare porous fibers via electrospinning.
The PVP was heated at 80 °C for 1 h to reduce its moisture content
prior to use. The electrospinning system was composed of a gas-tight
syringe (1000 μm, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) with a 27G needle,
a syringe pump (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA),
two high-voltage generators with positive and negative polarity (HER-30P1,
Matsusada Precision Inc., Shiga, Japan), a temperature controller
(PAU-300S-HC, Apiste Corp., Osaka, Japan), a heater (HLT-61, Hitachi
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), a humidity controller (AHCU-1, KITZ Corp., Chiba,
Japan), a chamber, and an aluminum collector plate. Typically, a positive
voltage of 10 kV was applied to the syringe needle to obtain a stable
liquid jet, and a counter voltage of −4 kV was applied to the
aluminum collector plate. The precursor solution was pumped at 4 μL
min–1. To evaluate the phase separation and the
breath figure mechanism, trials were run with the chamber environment
conditioned to relative humidities of 35, 50, or 70%. The syringe
position was set at a fixed distance of 12 cm from the collector plate.
The morphology of the porous fibers mats in the high humidity environment
was stabilized by immersing the fibers in 80 °C water for 3 h.

4.2 Characterization of Precursors, Porous Fibers
Mats, and Aerosol Filtration Performance
The viscosity of
the aqueous solutions was evaluated using a Brookfield DV-III rheometer
(Brookfield, Middleboro, MA, USA). The morphologies of the spun porous
fiber mats were observed by field-emission SEM (S-5000, 20 kV, Hitachi
High-Tech. Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Aerosol filtration properties
were assessed by electrospinning a precursor solution on the surface
of a base filter to obtain multilayer filter membranes. Circular microfiber
mats (Nippon Muki Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) consisting a nonwoven fabric
made of polypropylene with polyethylene terephthalate fibers, with
a basis weight of 3.35–3.54 g m–2 and a diameter
of 5.23 cm, were used as the base filters. The performance of each
of the prepared multilayer filters was evaluated using atmospheric
dust particles with sizes in the range of 0.03–0.3 μm.
These filters were exposed to isopropanol vapor overnight, prior to
each measurement, to eliminate the effects of the electrostatic deposition
of dust particles. Details of the measurement procedure have been
provided in a previous publication.2,3
