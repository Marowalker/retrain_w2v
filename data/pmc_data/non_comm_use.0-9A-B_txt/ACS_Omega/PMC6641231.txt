Determination
of biomarkers in clinical or food samples is of crucial
importance for monitoring, prevention, and care of public health.
The standard procedure used for this purpose is the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which makes use of the specific antibody–antigen
biorecognition and the catalytic effect of the enzymes. One of the
main shortcomings of this technique is the use of enzymes that often
present low chemical and thermal stabilities compared to other chemicals.
Other drawbacks include the nonspecific binding process that could
lead to false-positive results, the use of relatively large amounts
of the sample, and the number of time-consuming steps involved. Recently,
an enzyme-free and ultrasensitive analytical method for antigen detection
denoted as intensity depletion immunolinked assay (IDILA) has been
proposed by our laboratory. The assay is based on the inhibition to
form Ag nanosphere dimers linked by a specific antibody in the presence
of the corresponding antigen. In this work, we go a step further demonstrating
how the performance of this method could be improved by using silver
nanoparticles (Ag NPs) of different diameters (58 and 78 nm). The
experiments are performed for detecting gliadin, an antigen of utmost
importance in celiac disease, and the results are compared with ELISA,
the standard technique homologated by the Food Codex Alimentarius.
It is found that the IDILA assay could be around 1000 or 10 000
times more sensitive than ELISA, also having lower limits of detection,
depending on the conditions explored (fraction of dimers and Ag NP
diameter). Using the appropriate conditions, the IDILA assay is shown
to be able to detect femtomolar concentrations of the antigen, besides
being robust, reliable, cheap, rapid (around 2 h), and of easy implementation
using the standard equipment and biomolecular reagents used for the
ELISA assay.

==== Body
Introduction
Gluten is a set of
proteins present in the flour of cereals such
as wheat, barley, rye, oats, and their hybrid species.1 This protein complex is composed of prolamin and glutenin.
Gliadin is a type of prolamin present in the grain of wheat and is
the protein responsible for causing celiac disease (CD).2 CD is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered
by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals
and represents a unique example of an immune-mediated disease for
which early serologic diagnosis and dietary treatment can prevent
severe and sometimes life-threatening complications. The prevalence
of CD in different parts of the world has been estimated to be around
0.5–1%. In addition, the population bearing diabetes or autoimmune
disorders or relatives of CD individuals have even higher risk for
CD development.3,4

Therefore, the development
of a methodology that allows the detection
of gluten in a fast and specific sensitive way is a topic of great
importance in food science for its implications in health care. Currently,
the content of gliadin in food is determined by the well-known enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a methodology that uses the basic immunology
concept of antigen binding to its specific antibody.5 In ELISA, the antigen in the fluid phase is immobilized,
usually in 96-well plates, to a specific antibody, which is itself
subsequently detected by a secondary, enzyme-coupled antibody that
yields a visible color change or fluorescence, indicating the presence
of the antigen.6 There are however, several
drawbacks associated with ELISA such as the use of enzymes whose chemical
and physical stabilities are relatively low compared with other chemicals
and the occurrence of nonspecific binding events to the plate, which
could lead to false-positive results. Another issue is that the assay
normally requires the use of large amounts of reagents and various
washing steps.7,8

Considering the abovementioned
shortcomings of the ELISA assay,
the development of enzyme-free analytical assays that surmounts these
limitations, specifically capable of rapid and specific antigen quantification,
with improved stability, using smaller sample amounts, and with no
false positives has become necessary. In recent years, continuous
effort has been devoted to the development of reliable and robust
enzyme-free detection methods. In fact, various advanced techniques,
such as surface plasmon resonance, electrochemical, quartz crystal
microbalance, and optical analyses have been applied for the detection
and quantification of biomarkers based on different respective signal
generation principles.9,10 Nanoparticle (NP)-based trials
have demonstrated to have the potential for detecting events and processes
with unprecedented levels of sensitivity, location, and stability.11−18 The high biocompatibility of these NPs, including metal NPs, carbon
nanomaterials, metal oxide nanostructures, and semiconductor nanocrystals,
has been successfully used for the development of qualitative and
quantitative detection assays for several biomarkers based on their
physical and chemical properties.9,19,20 For instance, Yu et al. have recently designed MeLISA,
an enzyme-free and metal-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection
of ultralow concentrations of disease biomarkers, such as α-fetoprotein,
prostatic specific antigen, and C-reactive protein. This method exhibits
approximately 2 magnitudes higher sensitivity and is 4 times faster
for a chromogenic reaction than ELISA. In MeLISA, the secondary or
detection antibody is coupled to Ag NPs, which in the presence of
H2O2 dissolves to produce millions of Ag+ ions that are further converted into an amplified color signal
by inducing the aggregation of alkyne-functionalized Au NPs9 or by turning on the ultrasensitive silver ion
fluorescence probe 3′,6′-bis(diethylamino)-2-(2-iodoethyl)spiro[isoindoline-1,9′-xanthen]-3-one.19

In particular, because of their extreme
sensitivity to the chemical
environment, the optical properties of noble metal NPs are now widely
used for the development of ultrasensitive molecular detection platforms.18 This sensitivity is due to the so-called localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), the elementary quantum quasi-particle
corresponding to the oscillation of the conduction electrons of the
metal when illuminated by electromagnetic radiation. The LSPR can
be tuned just by changing the geometrical parameters, such as the
size, shape, dielectric environment, and particle–particle
spacing. In addition, it could give rise to highly localized and enhanced
electromagnetic fields, which is the basis for the so-called enhanced
spectroscopy techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,
tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and metal-enhanced fluorescence as
well as optical imaging well below the diffraction limit of light.21−26 Because of the abovementioned properties, a wide range of applications
are having exponential growth in both basic and applied sciences,
as for example, the design of ultrasensitive optical nanosensors and
subdiffraction optical imaging techniques.27−31 All of these developments are a very active area
of research denoted as Plasmonics.32−34

Very importantly,
the optical properties of noble metal NPs in
combination with their surface properties are suitable for developing
several functionalization strategies involving biomolecules that could
be specific linkers and also biorecognition agents that are able to
preferentially interact with target molecules.35−37 The possibility
of generating dimers of silver NPs linked by a specific antibody by
stoichiometric control of the functionalization and to inhibit the
dimer formation in the presence of the corresponding antigen has led
us recently to propose a new and powerful analytical method, denoted
as IDILA (intensity depletion immunolinked assay). The optical detection
is possible because of the differences between the extinction cross-sections
of two isolated monomers compared with one dimer and the different
fraction of dimers produced at different antigen concentrations.37

In our early work, the capabilities of
the method to detect ultralow
concentrations of cytokines (biomarkers involved in the diagnosis
and prognosis of chronic inflammatory diseases) were shown. The aim
of the present work is several folds: first, to further investigate
the general capabilities of IDILA to other antigens of importance
in ood science, such as gliadin. Second, to understand the role played
by the fraction of Ag NP dimers formed using Ag NPs of two different
diameters upon its sensitivity and detection limits as well as the
theoretical basis of the method in a more rigorous way.37 For such a purpose, we have performed experiments
as well as theoretical simulations with 58 and 78 nm diameter Ag NPs
to explore the capabilities of the IDILA method to quantify ultralow
concentrations of gliadin at different Ag NP sizes. Another important
question that arises is the role played by the fraction of dimers
(formed after the addition of a given amount of the antibody at a
given time, in the absence of the antigen) on the sensitivity of the
method. To answer this issue, we have also tested the method at two
quite different fractions of dimers formed after the addition of a
given amount of the antibody. Finally, we demonstrate the high potential
of this method to detect ultralow concentrations of gliadin in real
samples of food, using samples that are supposed to be gluten-free
(corn starch and corn flour), where the standard ELISA fails, particularly
for corn starch.

Results and Discussion
NP Functionalization
The Ag NPs were functionalized
in a 1:1:1 molar ratio with streptavidin (STV) and biotin (Biot).
This chemical process was performed just by the addition of biotin HPDP simultaneously with the STV protein to reach
the same concentration as that of the Ag NPs (calculated from the
peak intensity of the extinction spectra using Beer’s law and
with the calculated extinction cross-section corresponding to each
NP diameter). The STV–Biot combination was used because of
the high kinetic and thermodynamic interaction constant of the STV–Biot
complex which avoids the prior chemisorption of biotin molecules on
the surface of Ag NPs that could lead to the formation of undesired
aggregates.27 The reaction using biotin
HPDP leads to Ag NPs functionalized with biotin (due to its SH moiety)
and mercapto-pyridine-2 thione. It should be noticed that although
the pyridine-2-thione molecule will also bind to the surface of the
Ag NPs, the presence of this molecule on its surface does not cause
any difficulty. This is so because the presence of this molecule neither
inhibits the surface functionalization with biotin (through its SH
group) nor the interaction of biotin with STV and the subsequent specific
antibody binding events with the antigen28 (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

The biotin (SH) covalently bound to the Ag NPs will interact
strongly with STV, leaving the surface of the NP modified with the
Biot–STV complex, with one of the sites bound to biotin and
leaving three sites available for interacting with any biotinylated
molecule. The addition of a biotinylated antibody will in this way
interact with one of this STV sites. Then, if another Biot–STV-functionalized
NP (free of antibody) approaches, a dimeric structure sandwiched by
the biotinylated antibody will be produced.35−37

Because
of the simultaneous addition of STV and biotin to the Ag
NP colloidal dispersion and the strict stoichiometric control, the
stability of the Biot–STV-functionalized colloidal dispersion
is very high (see Figure S2A,B). The extinction
spectra remain almost the same up to a time of 20 min with any signature
of NP aggregation [see transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, Figure S3].

Influence of Ag NP Size
and IgG-Biot Concentration on the Fraction
of Dimers Formed
Once the NPs were functionalized, the next
step consisted in forming controlled agglomerates (dimers) in the
presence of the specific biotinylated antibody for gliadin (Figure 1A). The degree of
dimerization will be spectrally reflected by the degree of depletion
of the extinction intensity (see the theoretical discussion below).
For a given experimental condition, as the intensity decreases, more
dimers are formed.

Figure 1 (A) Scheme of the Ag NPs biotin–STV interaction
and the
subsequent formation of dimeric structures in the presence of IgG
Biot anti-gliadin. (B) Variation of the intensity of the extinction
spectrum of Ag NPs (58 nm diameter) taken at a wavelength of 450 nm
for different concentrations of gliadin IgG Biot. (C) Variation of
the intensity of the extinction spectrum of Ag NPs (78 nm diameter)
taken at a wavelength of 465 nm for different concentrations of gliadin
IgG Biot.

To address the influence of the
concentration of the IgG biotinylated
anti-gliadin antibody (IgG-Biot) and the role played by the Ag NP
size on the degree of dimerization, a set of experiments for 58 and
78 nm Ag NPs varying the antibody concentration were performed. All
these experiments were carried out on a quartz cuvette using 0.5 mL
of the 58 and 78 nm Ag NP colloidal dispersions previously functionalized
with STV–Biot and different IgG-Biot concentrations supplemented
with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
to complete a final volume of 1 mL. The extinction spectra were measured
in the 300–1100 nm wavelength range.

For these series
of experiments, the depletion of the intensity
of extinction E(D) was calculated as E(t)/E(0), where E(t) is the peak intensity of the extinction spectra at a given time
(t) after adding a given amount of IgG-Biot and E(0) is the initial peak extinction intensity.

Figure 1 shows the
variation of E(D) as a function of the
gliadin antibody concentration for the two Ag NP diameters analyzed
in the present work. The intensities were measured after 27 min, a
time point after which no change of extinction was observed, that
is, the spectra remain the same. The behavior for both Ag NP diameters
is qualitatively the same. As the IgG-Biot concentration increases, E(D) begins to increase, then it reaches a maximum,
and finally it decreases. The growing part of the curve indicates
that the fraction of dimers formed is larger as the concentration
of IgG-Biot increases; the maximum corresponds to the IgG-Biot concentration,
which produces the highest fraction of dimers. The antigen concentrations
where dimer formation is more favored are 1 and 0.25 ng/mL for the
experiments performed using 58 nm (Figure 1B) and 78 nm (Figure 1C) Ag NPs, respectively. In both cases, the
fraction of dimers formed can be estimated (as it will be discussed
later) by electrodynamics calculations. The calculations show that
in both cases, the fraction of dimers formed is almost the same (around
0.9). The antibody concentration needed to achieve the same degree
of dimerization is 4 times larger for the colloidal dispersion that
is 4 times more concentrated (58 nm Ag NPs). Therefore, it seems that
the NP size has no effect on the degree of dimerization.

After
the antibody concentration where the maximum extinction depletion
is reached, the fraction of dimers formed decreases until reaching
a value where the concentration of IgG-Biot is so high that under
these conditions, most of the available binding sites of the STV molecules
on the surface of each NP are occupied by individual IgG-Biot molecules
inhibiting the dimer formation.

Dimerization Process at
a Constant Antibody Concentration
The kinetics of dimerization
for the same antibody concentration
(1 ng/mL of IgG-Biot) was followed for both NP diameters for 27 min.
The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 2A,B. For both NP sizes, the decrease in extinction
evidences the formation of dimers, and for this antibody concentration,
the depletion, E(D), after 27 min is 24
and 9% for 58 nm (Figure 2A) and 78 nm Ag NPs (Figure 2B), respectively. This result should indicate that
the dimer formation using 1 ng/mL gliadin antibody is more favored
for 58 nm than for 78 nm diameter Ag NPs, a result that is in good
agreement with what has been shown in the previous section.

the extinction spectra for two different average diameter
colloidal dispersion Ag NPs in the presence of 1 ng/mL gliadin IgG
Biot. (A) 58 nm diameter Ag NPs and (B) 78 nm diameter Ag NPs.

The morphological characterization
of the structures formed at
27 min was performed by TEM using a diluted aliquot of the colloidal
dispersion in such a way to avoid any in situ aggregation processes
that could be generated on the grid during evaporation and diffusion
of the aggregates. Some representative TEM images for both NP sizes
evidenced the formation of mainly Ag NP dimers, with a small fraction
of isolated Ag NPs (see Figure 3A).

Figure 3 (A) TEM image of Ag NPs after 30 min of aggregation of 1 ng/mL
gliadin IgG Biot, where it is evident that the presence of dimeric
structures predominates over other nanostructures. (B) Interparticle
distance estimation for the Ag NP dimer formed by the “sandwich”
biotin–STV IgG Biot STV–biotin. (C) TEM images of some
representative Ag NP dimers formed after 30 min of adding 1 ng/mL
IgG Biot anti-gliadin for two different average diameter Ag NPs.

Figure 3 depicts
the magnified TEM images of the dimers, with a 20 nm average interparticle
distance (gap) (Figure 3C), which is in excellent agreement with the distance that can be
estimated from the size of the molecules linking the Ag NP dimers
(Figure 3B). The “molecular
bridge” formed by the molecules biotin–STV–Biot-IgG–STV–biotin
gives an interparticle distance value of around 20 nm. A set of additional
TEM images are also shown in Figure S5 panels
A and B.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements also validate
the formation
of NP aggregates. The distribution of DLS intensities of the 58 and
78 nm Ag NPs colloidal dispersions before the addition of the antibody
(black dotted lines in Figure 4A,B) shows a maximum for an average hydrodynamic diameter
at around 62 and 99 nm, respectively. The DLS distribution (after
27 min of adding the antibody) is clearly shifted to larger sizes
(blue dotted lines, Figure 4A,B), having a maximum at 120 and 134 nm for 58 and 78 nm
Ag NPs, respectively. This observation qualitatively indicates the
formation of structures of larger sizes (dimers).

(black symbols) and after (blue symbols)
adding 1 ng/mL IgG Biot to Ag NP colloidal dispersions of different
average sizes. (A) Average Ag NP diameter 58 nm and (B) average Ag
NP diameter 78 nm.

Comparison between Experiments
and Theoretical Simulations
Another more rigorous way of
corroborating the observed experimental
data is through electrodynamics modeling using the Mie theory (for
isolated Ag NPs) and the generalized Mie theory for multiple particles
(for Ag dimers).

In all calculations, we considered average
Ag NP diameters of 58 and 78 nm. For the calculations of the effective
cross-sections of the dimers, an interparticle distance of 20 nm was
considered.

The first issue that arises is to understand why
the formation
of dimers is spectrally evidenced as a decrease in the intensity of
the extinction spectrum.37 The theoretical simulation of the
extinction spectra using the Mie theory for Ag monomers of 58 and
78 nm (see Figure S6) shows that the extinction
cross-section σext for the smaller and larger Ag
NPs are σext = 2.88 × 10–10 cm2 and σext = 4.43 × 10–10 cm2, respectively. The average extinction cross-section
for the dimers formed for each NP size are σext =
4.35 × 10–10 cm2 for 58 nm Ag NP
dimers and σext = 7.14 × 10–10 cm2 for the dimers formed from 78 nm Ag NPs (see Figure S6). The sum of the extinction cross-sections
of the two isolated monomers (separated at very large distances) is
σext = 5.76 × 10–10 cm2 (red line in Figure S6A) and σext = 8.86 × 10–10 cm2 for
the 58 and 78 nm diameter Ag NPs (red line in Figure S6B), respectively. The main factors that explain why
the formation of dimer structures produces a depletion of the extinction
intensity are the lower values of the extinction cross-section of
each dimer compared with the cross-section of the corresponding monomers
and the negligible shift of the extinction spectra of the dimer relative
to the corresponding monomer (because of the small plasmon coupling
due to the relative large gap between the Ag NPs). Another factor
is that the final concentration of NPs is smaller (in the limit where
all monomers form dimers, the concentration of dimers should be one-half
the concentration of monomers).

As it can be appreciated in Figure 5, there is a very
good agreement between the experimental
(pink line) and the simulated extinction spectra for the colloidal
dispersion of Ag NPs (without the addition of IgG-Biot) for both NP
diameters. The concentration of NPs was determined from Beer’s
law from the peak intensity of the experimental extinction spectra I(E) and using the values of the theoretical
extinction cross-sections. The initial concentration of the NP monomers
was found to be 1.5 × 10–12 and 6.1 ×
10–13 M for 58 and 78 nm diameter Ag NPs, respectively.

Figure 5 Comparison
between the experimental (pink and black lines) and
simulated (green and red lines) extinction spectra before and after
27 min of adding 1 ng/mL IgG Biot for two different diameter-functionalized
Ag colloidal dispersions. The fraction of dimers fd was estimated using eq 2. (A) 58 nm Ag NPs with fd = 0.9 and (B) 78 nm Ag NPs with fd =
0.2.

To make a comparison between the
experimental spectrum and the
spectra obtained after 27 min of adding 1 ng/mL IgG-Biot, it is necessary
to know the fraction of dimers formed at this reaction time.

For the dimerization process  where
M denotes Ag monomers and D denotes
Ag NP dimers; the total concentration of particles (monomers plus
dimers) [NPs]t at any time t can be expressed in terms of the initial concentration of NPs [NPs]i and the fraction of dimers  as 1  

Therefore, the extinction
at a given time t will
be given by the following expression 2  where Et is the extinction
at time t, σm is the extinction
cross-section of the monomers, and σd is the extinction
cross-section of the dimers. Note that
the first and second terms in eq 2 correspond to the partial contribution to the extinction
of monomers and dimers, respectively.

Using the above expression,
together with the initial Ag NP concentrations
as well as the theoretical cross-sections, the fraction of dimers fd can be determined by varying its value in
a systematic way until the theoretical peak intensity of the extinction
spectra fits with the experimental one. Using this procedure, it was
determined that fd = 0.9 and fd = 0.2 for the 58 and 78 nm diameter Ag NP dispersions,
respectively (see red lines in Figure 5A,B).

Dividing eq 2 by the
initial extinction, E0 = [NPs]iσm, the degree of depletion Ed is given by 3  which indicates that Ed is determined
by the ratio of the cross-section of the monomer
and the corresponding dimer, for a given value of fd. The variation of Ed with fd is almost the same for Ag NP average diameters
in the range of 48–68 nm, whereas it becomes significantly
different for diameters around 78 nm (see Figure S7 and the respective discussion). Therefore, we considered
it suitable to test the performance of the method for Ag NP sizes
where σd/σm and hence the respective
extinction depletion depicts quite different behavior, that is, for
Ag NP average sizes around 58 and 78 nm.

Inhibition of Dimer Formation
The question that now
arises is what happens if the antigen and the antibody are present
simultaneously during the dimerization process. To address this issue,
we compare the evolution of the extinction spectra of Biot–STV-functionalized
58 nm diameter Ag NPs at a constant Biot-IgG concentration (1 ng/mL)
in the absence (Figure 6A) and presence of the antigen (gliadin) at two different concentrations
(Figure 6B,C). Inhibition
of the formation of dimers will be evidenced spectrally by a decrease
in the degree of depletion of the extinction intensity. In the absence
of the antigen, after the addition of 1 ng/mL Biot-Ig, the extinction
spectra decreases, reaching maximum depletion after 27 min, indicating
the formation of dimers (Figure 6A). The results obtained when the same experiment is
carried out with the addition of 5 pg/mL antigen (Figure 6B) indicate that although there
is a decrease in the intensity of the extinction spectrum, the value
that reaches the intensity at the same time (27 min) is lower compared
to the same assay performed without the presence of antibody (Figure 6A), indicating that
the formation of dimers is less favored. In the presence of 15 pg/mL
antigen (Figure 6C),
no significant changes in the intensity of the extinction spectrum
are observed; therefore, it seems that under this condition, the antigen
concentration is high enough that the formation of dimers is totally
inhibited.

Figure 6 (A) Evolution of the extinction spectra of 58 nm diameter colloidal
dispersion of Ag NPs previously functionalized with STV–Biot
up to a time of 27 min after the addition of the antibody (with a
final concentration of 1 ng/mL of IgG Biot). (B) Under the same conditions
but in the presence of 5 pg/mL antigen. (C) Under the same conditions
but in the presence of 15 pg/mL antigen.

These experiments clearly evidence that the optical response
depends
on the concentration of the antigen. This property is central because
it will allow us in principle to build a calibration curve and the
subsequent quantification of the antigen in the problem samples.

Building the Calibration Curve for Gliadin Detection by IDILA
To build the calibration curve, the IDILA assay was performed using
Ag NPs of two different diameters (58 and 78 nm) at the same antibody
concentration (1 ng/mL). The reason for choosing the same concentration
of IgG-Biot and two different Ag NP diameters is to analyze if there
is any influence of the fraction of dimers formed on the sensitivity
and capability of the technique for gliadin detection. As discussed
above, for 1 ng/mL antibody concentration, the fraction of dimers
formed for 58 nm Ag NPs (fd = 0.9) is
significantly larger than for 78 nm Ag NPs (fd = 0.2). The calibration curve was constructed by recording
the extinction intensity at 450 nm after 27 min of adding the antibody
in the presence of different concentrations of antigen. Figure 7A,B shows the results obtained
for 58 and 78 nm diameter Ag NPs, respectively. Both calibration curves
can be fitted quite accurately by an exponential function of the type E = −A0e–bc + I0. This function
describes quite well the behavior observed, that is, the inhibition
of dimer formation at relatively small antigen concentrations, which
is translated by an increase of the extinction intensity and the almost
total inhibition of the formation of dimers produced at larger antigen
concentrations, which gives rise to an almost constant (no change)
extinction intensity.

Figure 7 IDILA experimental calibration curve for gliadin antigen
in the
presence of 1 ng/mL gliadin specific biotinylated antibody for two
different size colloidal dispersions of functionalized Ag NPs for
(A) 58 and (B) 78 nm average diameters. The error was calculated as
the average of three calibration curves. Both curves could be fitted
to a function I = I0A0 exp(bc), where I is the extinction intensity and c is the antigen
concentration. The parameters for the curve in panel A are I0 = 0.066, A0 =
0.013, and b = 0.215, whereas for the curve in panel
B, they are I0 = 0.024, A0 = 0.04, and b = 1.315.

To assess the analytical performance of a quantification
method,
it is a standard practice to linearize the initial portion of the
calibration curve. It was found that both curves could be fitted quite
well by a linear expression in the range of 0–1.2 pg/mL for
78 nm diameter Ag NPs and 0–8 pg/mL for 58 nm diameter Ag NPs,
as respectively depicted in Figure 8A,B. Comparing both calibration curves, the first difference
that can be observed is that the linear range of quantification is
larger for 58 nm Ag NPs than for 78 nm. This behavior could be explained
considering that the fraction of dimers formed using 1 ng/mL antibody
for 78 nm is smaller than for 58 nm Ag NPs (see simulations shown
in Figure 5), therefore,
a significant smaller antigen concentration (1.2 pg/mL) is needed
to inhibit the formation of dimers. Another important difference between
both calibration curves is the limit of detection (LOD), the limit
of quantification (LOQ), and the sensitivity. The LOD and sensitivity
of the technique are 20 times smaller and 6 times larger using 78
nm Ag NPs in comparison with the values obtained for 58 nm Ag NPs.
This seems to be a contra-intuitive conclusion because for the experiments
performed for 78 nm Ag NPs, the fraction of dimers formed is relatively
smaller (fd = 0.2) than for 58 nm Ag NPs
(fd = 0.9). However, it should be realized
that if there is a smaller dimer fraction, then a small variation
of the dimer concentration should be translated to a more significant
change on the extinction intensity than when there is a larger dimer
fraction (see eq 5 and Figure S7 and the respective discussion in
the Supporting Information)

calibration curve (taken from the corresponding
exponential fits of Figure 7) for the quantification of samples of corn starch and corn
flour. (A) In the range 0 1.2 pg/mL for the experiments performed
with 78 nm diameter Ag NPs and (B) in the range 0 8 pg/mL for the

Gliadin Extraction and
Detection in Food Samples
To
test whether gliadin extraction from the food samples has been effective,
we performed the western blot assay and Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (IR-ATR) characterization
(see Figure S8).

The results obtained
show that the method is effective in extracting the gliadin complex
in oat and wheat food samples, whereas for corn flour and corn starch,
neither of these techniques is sensitive enough to determine the presence
of gliadin because corn has very low contents of gluten.

Therefore,
to quantify the content of gliadin in these samples,
a method with a very small LOD should be required. The IDILA or ELISA
technique having a lower LOD seem to be, in principle, suitable for
this purpose.

Gliadin Detection by ELISA
The ELISA
calibration curve
for gliadin detection was constructed using the methodology described
in the Supporting Information (microplate
reader measurements) and could be fitted quite accurately to a linear
function with a mean square deviation of 0.97 (red line Figure 9). The LOD for gliadin using
ELISA, calculated as the blank measured intensity plus 3 standard
deviations, was found to be 1.82 ng/mL.

Figure 9 Calibration curve for
gliadin using the ELISA method obtained from
the commercially available kit. The LOD for gliadin was found to be
1.82 ng/mL. From this curve, the concentration of gliadin in real
samples of corn starch was found to be below the LOD, whereas for
corn flour, a value of 2.2 ± 0.1 ng/mL was determined.

The values of the amount of gliadin
for the corn flour sample give
a gliadin content of 2.2 ± 0.1 ng/mL, a value that is above the
LOD. However, for the corn starch sample, the values obtained are
below the LOD; hence, the amount of gliadin in these samples is not
able to be quantified by ELISA.

Gliadin Detection by IDILA
As it has been shown above,
the LOD of the IDILA technique is 0.52 pg/mL (for 58 nm Ag NPs) and
0.025 pg/mL (for 78 nm Ag NPs), values that are by far smaller than
those obtained for the same antigen using ELISA. Therefore, it is
expected that the IDILA technique should be able to quantify the amount
of gliadin for both corn starch and corn flour. According to the Ag
NP size employed (58 or 78 nm), to quantify the amount of gliadin,
the problem samples were diluted 1000 and 10 000 times, respectively
(because the LOQ of IDILA is almost 10 times smaller for 78 nm than
for 58 nm Ag NPs)

The quantified values for gliadin in corn
flour obtained from the linear fitting of the calibration curve for
both Ag NP sizes (Figure 8A,B) are 6 ± 1 and 9.2 ± 0.6 pg/mL (multiplied by
the corresponding dilution factor), values that are very close between
them (within the experimental error) and also with the ELISA values
(2.2 ng/mL, considering the dilution factor gives a value around 8
pg/mL). For the corn starch samples, the gliadin concentrations obtained
are 2.0 ± 0.5 and 4.5 ± 0.2 pg/mL, again in fairly good
agreement between them. An important aspect to consider is that the
IDILA assay was able to quantify a small amount of gliadin in the
corn starch samples (note that in this case, they were diluted by
a factor of 1000–10 000 with respect to the ELISA samples)
where the ELISA method failed because it is below its LOD.

Comparison
between IDILA and ELISA
The comparison between
the two assays can be analyzed in terms of two aspects. The first
corresponds to the information related to the quantification of antigen
in real samples. It should first be noted that IDILA is a technique
that allows the detection of very low concentrations of antigen under
study using dilution factors different from those used in the ELISA. Table 1 summarizes the results
for the quantification of corn flour and corn starch in real samples.
It can be appreciated that there is good agreement between the values
obtained between both methodologies, considering that the corresponding
dilution of the ELISA technique gives a final concentration of gliadin
in the corn flour of 4.5 ± 0.7 mg/kg. On the other hand, the
IDILA quantification of gliadin in the same sample of corn flour results
in a concentration of 3 ± 1 mg/kg (using 58 nm Ag NPs) or 5 ±
1 mg/kg (employing 78 nm Ag NPs). For the corn starch sample, the
ELISA method was not able to quantify the antigen, whereas the IDILA
method gave a value as small as 0.1 ± 0.08 or 0.18 ± 0.06
mg/kg (using 58 or 78 nm Ag NPs, respectively).

Table 1 Comparison between the ELISA and the
IDILA Assays for the Quantification of Gliadin in Real Samples Using
1 ng/mL Gliadin-Specific Antibody and Two Different Ag NP Sizes
quantification
method	gliadin concentration in corn
starch (mg/kg)	gliadin concentration
in corn flour (mg/kg)	
ELISA	N/D	4.5 ± 0.7	
IDILA using Ag NPs of 58 nm diameter
with 0.9 dimer fraction	0.1 ± 0.08	3 ± 1	
IDILA using Ag NPs of 78 nm diameter
with 0.2 dimer fraction	0.18 ± 0.06	5 ± 1	
The second aspect is related to the analytical figures of merit
of each technique obtained from the calibration curves (Table 2). As pointed out below, the
LOD of the IDILA assay is several orders of magnitude lower than that
of the ELISA method. The value of LOD of the IDILA method can further
be improved using antibody concentrations where the fraction of dimers
formed is less favored, as in the experiments performed using 78 nm
Ag NPs, where the LOD was decreased by a factor of 20 just by performing
the assay with an antigen concentration such that 20% of dimers are
formed. The IDILA sensitivity is another parameter that has been demonstrated
to increase almost 10 000 times with respect to the ELISA method,
but there is less significant increase of it (a factor of 6) working
under conditions where a smaller fraction of dimers is formed.

Table 2 Comparison between the Analytical
Parameters of IDILA and ELISA
 	IDILA (pg/mL)	 	
 	Ag NPs 58 nm	Ag NPs 78 nm	ELISA (ng/mL)	
sensitivity	(1.5 ± 0.1) × 103	(9 ± 1) × 103	(1.6 ± 0.1) × 102	
LOD	0.52	0.025	1.82	
LOQ	2.1	0.2	4.87	
Concerning the LOQ, the values for
the IDILA technique are (in
the linear regime) 4000–40 000 (depending on the conditions
that favor more or less the fraction of dimers) smaller than those
of the ELISA method.

Therefore, these ultrasmall LOD and LOQ
parameters implies that
with an amount of the sample thousands of times smaller than that
used by ELISA, the gliadin antigen could be detected by IDILA.

Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated the applicability of IDILA for
the detection of ultralow concentrations of gliadin in real samples
of corn flour and corn starch and compared the results with the standard
ELISA method. The IDILA assay was found to be 1000–10 000
times more sensitive than the ELISA method, also having better performance
in terms of the smaller LOD and LOQ.

It has been rationalized
using electrodynamics simulations that,
after adding a given amount of antibody, it is possible to quantify
the degree of dimerization by fitting the experimental extinction
intensity at a given time (from the initial NP concentration and the
extinction cross-section of the Ag NP monomers and dimers in the colloidal
dispersion).

The process of inhibition of dimer formation in
the presence of
antigen has been studied at antibody concentrations that favor the
formation of a large fraction of dimers (for 58 nm diameter Ag NPs)
or the formation of a relatively small fraction (for 78 nm diameter
NPs). It was demonstrated that working under conditions where this
fraction is small, the LOD and LOQ decrease almost an order of magnitude.
Nevertheless, both NP sizes are able to detect gliadin at pg/mL concentrations.
In addition, IDILA was able to quantify amounts of gliadin in corn
starch samples that have concentrations smaller by an order of magnitude
(in ppm) than the LOD of the standard ELISA method.

Another
important feature of this technique is its feasibility,
in terms of its relatively faster execution time of about 2 h including
the preparation of antigen, antibody, and the respective dilutions
of reagents, and also because the assay is performed in solution and
does not require washing steps.

In addition, it makes use of
the same materials necessary to carry
out the ELISA technique, that is, a microplate reader and traditional
96-well microplates allowing to perform this test with instrumentation
commonly used in biochemistry laboratories. The smaller amounts of
antibody and antigen used, evidenced by the significant smaller LOD
and LOQ of the IDILA method (in the femtomolar concentration regime),
makes this method significantly cheaper than the ELISA method.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
The following reagents were used: AgNO3 (Blaker—Sigma-Aldrich); sodium citrate (Anhedra);
EZ-Link Biotin-HPDP (Pierce); STV (Invitrogen); primary rabbit polyclonal
IgG antibody to gliadin (LSBio); secondary biotinylated antibody to
wheat gliadin (LSBio), buffer saline phosphate; polysorbate 20 (Tween
20) (Sigma-Aldrich); NeutrAvidin (Thermo Scientific); sulfuric acid;
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) containing 12% polyacrylamide gel; PBS—0.05%
Tween 20; carbonate–bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 (Na2CO3 1.59 g, NaHCO 32.93 g, distilled water q.s. 1000 mL);
blocking solution (BSA 4.00 g, PBS 100 mL); diluent solution (BSA,
1.00 g, PBS 100 mL); western blot run buffer (25 mM Tris; 190 mM glycine;
0.1% SDS at pH 8.3) (Bio-Rad); tris buffer saline Tween 20 (Bio-Rad)
(50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20).

Methods
Synthesis
and Characterization of Ag NPs
The synthesis
of the Ag NPs was performed by a slight modification of the Turkevich
method based on the reduction of the metallic salt (AgNO3) with sodium citrate that also fulfills the role of a surfactant.38 Ag NPs having 58 and 78 nm diameters were manufactured
by adding 1 mL of 0.01 M sodium citrate and 1 mL of 0.01 M silver
nitrate to 150 mL of water under magnetic stirring and then heating
the solution till the boiling point. After 15 minutes, a volume of
90 μL (45 μL) of 0.01 M ascorbic acid was added to this
solution for obtaining 58 nm (78 nm) Ag NPs, till a yellow (yellow
white) color was observed. The optical and morphological characterizations
were performed using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy in
the range of 300–1100 nm, TEM, and by comparing the experimental
spectra with the electrodynamics modeling using the Mie’s theory.39 Using the experimental peak extinction intensities
and the extinction cross-section determined theoretically with the
Mie theory together with Beer’s law, the concentrations obtained
for the 58 nm diameter and 78 nm diameter Ag NPs were 1.5 × 10–12 and 6.1 × 10–13 M, respectively.
The diameters of the particles were obtained from the TEM images.

Ag NP Functionalization
Ag NPs were functionalized
with STV (Invitrogen) and biotin (Biot) (EZ-Link Biotin HPDP, Pierce).
For the surface modification of NPs, the colloidal dispersion was
incubated simultaneously with STV–Biot in a molar ratio 1:1:1
for 1 h at room temperature.

Gliadin Extraction from
Food Samples
A solution of
60% alcohol in water was used for the extraction of gliadin from samples
of maize flour and maize starch, according to the following procedure:(1) Dried
and ground samples (0.25 g)
were weighed and transferred to 10 mL propylene tubes.

(2) 60% alcohol in water solution (10
mL) was added to the propylene tubes and then incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with a rotary shaker at 45 revolutions per min.

(3) The tubes were centrifuged
for 10
min at 2500g at room temperature. One mL of the supernatant
was transferred using a clean micropipette to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes,
which was centrifuged for 5 min at 2500g at room
temperature.

(4) The supernatant,
containing the soluble
fraction of gluten of the sample, was transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf
tubes using Pasteur pipettes.40



Western Blot
The presence of gliadin
in food samples
under study was confirmed by the western blot analysis.41,42 Gliadin was extracted (by 60% alcohol extraction) from the bulk
material as detailed above. Samples of gliadin proteins (40 mg) were
fractionated through SDS-containing 12% polyacrylamide gels and then
electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 100 V in
transfer buffer solution (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20% methanol).
Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA–PBS for 3 h at 37 °C
and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS–Tween 20 0.05%
containing specific anti-gliadin mouse monoclonal primary antibodies
(LifeSpan BioSciences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA, diluted 1/1000). The
washed membranes were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with
secondary goat IRDye 680LT anti-mouse antibodies (1/25 000,
LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE, USA) and washed, and immunodetection
was performed using ODYSSEY infrared imaging system (LI-COR Bioscience).

Gliadin Quantification by ELISA
To validate the methodology proposed in the present work (IDILA), gliadin was analyzed in the
different samples by ELISA, which is the analytical method currently
homologated for gliadin detection in food samples by the Codex Alimentarius.43,44 A commercially available gliadin detection ELISA assay (LifeSpan
BioSicences Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) was used. In brief, 96-well microplates
plates were coated with 5 μg/mL polyclonal rabbit anti-gliadin
antibody in 50 mM carbonate–bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 (100
μL/well) overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 5% BSA–PBS
(200 μL/well) for 3 h at room temperature. Sample serial dilutions
(100 μL/well) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Biotinylated
rabbit anti-mouse IgG was added (diluted 1/1000, 100 μL/well)
and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed, and STV–peroxidase
was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the
washes, the reaction was developed with TMB substrate reagent (BD
OptEIA, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and absorbance was recorded
at 450 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

IR-ATR Spectroscopy
This technique was used as an alternative
tool to test if the extraction of gliadin from the analyzed samples
has been successful (corn flour and corn starch). The spectra were
taken in the range of 800–1900 cm–1 with
a Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer with a Spectral ATR Golden Gate
Mk II accessory with diamond crystal and reflection. The equipment
was purged with dry air to remove the contribution of the water vapor,
and the samples were allowed to evaporate on the reflectance glass
for subsequent acquisition of the spectra.45−48

Extinction Measurements
The characterization by UV–vis
spectroscopy was carried out by scanning in the 300–1100 nm
range. The spectra were measured using a Shimazdu UV-1700 PharmaSpec
spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cell at room temperature.

TEM
TEM images were obtained using a JEM-JEOL 1120
EXII under an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Samples were prepared
by adding one drop (∼30 μL) of the samples colloidal
solution onto a holey carbon–formvar-coated copper TEM grid
(100 mesh).

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
DLS
is a technique that
is generally used to determine the particle diameter in a solution
or colloidal dispersion, based on the temporal fluctuations of the
particle dispersion in solution and correlating these fluctuations
with the hydrodynamic radius of the particles. The optical characterization
of the different NPs and nanostructures was performed using a Delsa Nano 2.2 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cell
at room temperature.

Computational Methods
The optical
response of Ag NPs
was calculated using the Mie theory and the generalized multiparticle
Mie theory (GMM).39,49 In all calculations performed
in this work, the NPs were excited by a plane wave with an incidence
pointing vector (propagation direction) normal to the surface. All
calculations were performed for 58 and 78 nm diameter Ag NPs with
an interparticle spacing of 20 nm. The average extinction cross-section
(σExt) was calculated by averaging the extinction
cross-sections obtained by illuminating the dimer with polarizations
around the x, y, and z axes. . In all simulations,
we have used the dielectric
function tabulated by Palik for Ag.
