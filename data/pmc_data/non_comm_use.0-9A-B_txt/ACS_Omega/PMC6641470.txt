White organic light-emitting
diodes (WOLEDs) are at the center
stage of OLED research today because of their advantages in replacing
the high energy-consuming lighting technologies in vogue for a long
time. New materials that emit white light in simple devices are much
sought after. We have developed two novel electroluminescent materials,
referred to as BABZF and BATOMe, based on
a twisted bianthryl core, which are brilliantly fluorescent, thermally
highly stable with high Td and Tg, and exhibit reversible redox property. Although
inherently blue emissive, BABZF leads to white-light
emission (CIE ≈ 0.28, 0.33) with a moderate power efficiency
of 2.24 lm/W and a very high luminance of 15 600 cd/m2 in the fabricated multilayer nondoped OLED device. This device exhibited
excellent color stability over a range of applied potential. Remarkably,
similar white-light emission was captured even from a double-layer
device, attesting to the innate hole-transporting ability of BABZF despite it being non-nitrogenous, that is, lacking any
traditional hole-transporting di-/triarylamino group(s). Similar studies
with BATOMe led to inferior device performance results,
thereby underscoring the importance of dibenzofuryl groups in BABZF. Experimental as well as theoretical studies suggest
the possibility of emission from multiple species involving BABZF and its exciplex and electroplex in the devices. The
serendipitously observed white-light emission from a double-layer
device fabricated with an unconventional hole-transporting material
(HTM) opens up new avenues to create new non-nitrogenous HTMs that
may lead to more efficient white-light emission in simple double-layer
devices.

Introduction
Lighting and display
technologies based on organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) have captured a sizeable share of global market today.
Much attention continues to be paid at present to the development
of white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) owing to their prospect
of replacing the conventional lighting based on fluorescent and incandescent
bulbs.1 WOLEDs offer unrivaled advantages
in terms of color quality (color rendering index and glare-free light
that illuminates large area), opportunity for flexible devices, and
so forth.2−5 However, stability and durability of white light-emitting devices
coupled with manufacturing cost (material synthesis + device fabrication)—the
two major issues—must be addressed before full-fledged commercialization
of WOLED technologies can be made.2−6 Numerous reports on white-light emission from OLED devices have
appeared, but they are largely based on fundamental strategies.2−5 For example, white-light emission is commonly achieved by doping
phosphors of complimentary colors in a common host matrix.2−5 An analogous doping method that involves mixing of fluorescent and
phosphorescent materials has also been shown to lead to white-light
emission.2−5 Although such dopants are commercially available and are very efficient
emitters, phosphorescent dopants based on heavy metals are scarce
and are often costly. Also, such doping methods are nontrivial, as
control over dopant ratio during sublimation is not easy. Furthermore,
cascade energy transfer from the dopant possessing high band gap energy
to the ones with low band gap energies is thermodynamically a downhill
process, which may render optimization of dopant concentration an
arduous task. Another approach for white-light emission entails casting
of a multilayer device in which concurrent emission of different colors
occurs from each layer, leading collectively to white light.2−5 This method too requires a careful optimization of thicknesses of
the layers to sequester white light from such devices and is by no
means a trivial job. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to
develop materials that lead to white-light emission in simple devices,
which often exploit multispecies emission involving exciplex, electroplex,
excimer, and so forth.2−5,7−14

Recent literature reveals an exalting interest in bifunctional,
that is, hole transporting as well as emissive, materials that simplify
device engineering and minimize production cost, as they eliminate
the requirement of casting separate layers for hole transport and
emission;15−26 when separate materials are employed for hole transport and emission,
their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies should match
to allow efficient transport of holes from the former to the latter,
which is essential for good device performance. A single material
that serves for hole transport and emission not only precludes such
issues, but also simplifies the device configuration, paving way for
easy fabrication. In general, almost all bifunctional materials reported
so far contain “nitrogen” atom(s) as part of di-/triarylamine
and carbazole, which are responsible for hole transport.15−26 This is due to the ease with which an electron can be removed from
the nitrogen atom and the stabilization of the resultant radical cation.
However, the high ionization potential has been implicated to be responsible
for poor photooxidation stability, which diminishes the quality and
durability of the devices.27,28 We were, therefore,
motivated to develop bifunctional materials that do not contain di-/triarylamine
and/or carbazole as hole-transporting functional groups. Notably,
such materials are rare, and rarer are those that are emissive in
addition to being hole transporting.29−34 Furan30 and benzodifuran32 derivatives have been investigated as hole-transporting
materials (HTMs) in the recent OLED literature. By contrast, dibenzofuran-based
compounds are generally employed as host materials in phosphorescent
OLED devices.35−38 We surmised that it should be of interest to examine the hole-transporting
property of a dibenzofuran-functionalized bianthryl derivative, in
addition to inquiring into how a dibenzofuran group modifies the fluorescence
property of the parent bianthryl. Moreover, dibenzofuran, being a
rigid heterocycle, should endow the resultant material with good thermal
and morphological stabilities; notably, the anthracene units in bianthryl
are nearly orthogonal and hence should prevent aggregation-caused
quenching.39−44 Accordingly, we designed BABZF in which the bianthryl
is functionalized at 10 and 10′ positions with two dibenzofuryl
groups. An analogous fluorescent material, that is, BATOMe, functionalized at the same positions with 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl groups,
was also designed, cf. Figure 1, to compare the results with BABZF. We report
herein the synthesis, physical properties of BABZF and BATOMe, and serendipitous observation of white-light emission
from multilayer devices fabricated thereof. Remarkably, the emitted
white color is very stable over a broad range of applied potential.
The bifunctional, that is, hole transporting as well as emissive,
property of BABZF has been demonstrated by the fabrication
of double-layer devices, which also lead to white-light emission.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Both of the target bianthryl-based
compounds BABZF and BATOMe were synthesized
in high yields
with Suzuki coupling as the key reaction (Scheme 1). Accordingly, 9,9′-bianthryl was
synthesized following the literature-reported procedure and was subjected
subsequently to dibromination to obtain 10,10′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthryl.45 The latter was reacted with dibenzo[b,d]furan-2-ylboronic acid and 3,5-dimethoxyphenylboronic
acid to get hold of BABZF and BATOMe, respectively.

Photophysical Properties
Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption and fluorescence spectra of the bianthryls,
that is, BABZF and BATOMe, recorded in dilute
dichloromethane (DCM) solutions (ca. 1 × 10–5 M) are shown in Figure 2. The absorption spectra for both cases are dominated by the
structured features in the range of 325–425 nm, which are typical
of bianthryl chromophore. BABZF shows marginally different
absorption in the range of 275–325 nm, arising due presumably
to the absorption of two dibenzofuran moieties. Fluorescence spectra
of both bianthryls, for excitation at 340 nm, are similar and structureless
with λmax at 447 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra
of the materials in the vacuum-sublimed thin films are given in Figure S7. As can be seen, both BABZF and BATOMe have identical PL emission profiles. A comparison
of their PL spectra in DCM and thin films suggests that the latter
are broader as well as red-shifted, which suggests intermolecular
interactions in the solid state. Fluorescent quantum yields of BABZF and BATOMe in DCM determined relative to
anthracene as the standard are 92.1 and 89.0%, respectively, whereas
the same in the thin-film state are only 11.8 and 8.3%, respectively
(Table 1). The reduction
in the photoluminescence quantum efficiency by almost an order of
magnitude from DCM solutions to neat thin film suggests that aggregation-caused
quenching is operative in the solid state.

Electrochemical
Properties
Electrochemical properties
of BABZF and BATOMe were studied by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) in DCM in the presence of n-Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte in a typical
three-electrode setup consisting of a Ag/AgCl reference electrode,
a glassy carbon working electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode.
Both the bianthryls display reversible oxidations in anodic sweep
but exhibit no propensity for reduction in cathodic sweep within the
potential window in DCM (Figure S1). HOMO
energies of both the compounds determined from their half-cell oxidation
potentials (E1/2 ≈ 1.29 V) relative
to the Fc/Fc+ couple as the standard were similar, ca.
5.64 eV; note that ferrocene has a HOMO energy of 4.8 eV with respect
to vacuum. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies calculated
by subtraction of the molecular HOMO–LUMO energy gaps from
the HOMO energies were 2.68 and 2.65 eV for BABZF and BATOMe, respectively (cf. Table 1). The molecular HOMO–LUMO energy
gaps were in turn determined from the red-edge absorption cutoffs.

Thermal Properties
Good thermal stability is an important
prerequisite for a material to be applied in OLED devices because
the material must withstand significant heating effects during sublimation
as well as Joule heating. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed to investigate thermal properties
of the bianthryls. Both BABZF and BATOMe displayed very high decomposition temperatures (Tds) of 457 and 406 °C, respectively (Figure S2). BABZF was found to melt
at a very high temperature of ca. 436 °C, whereas BATOMe decomposed without melting. Furthermore, BABZF and BATOMe exhibited high glass-transition temperatures (Tgs) of 193 and 153 °C, respectively (Figure S3). High thermal stability of the compounds
presumably owes origin to the rigidity of the bianthryl core.

Electroluminescence
Properties
We fabricated the following
two devices to investigate electroluminescence (EL) properties of
the bianthryls: (A) ITO/NPB (40 nm)/bianthryls (10 nm)/TPBI (40 nm)/LiF
(1 nm)/Al (150 nm) and (B) ITO/m-MTDATA (40 nm)/BABZF (10 nm)/TPBI (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm), where indium
tin oxide (ITO) functions as the anode, N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB) and 4,4′,4″-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine (m-MTDATA)
serve as HTMs, 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-benzenetriyl)tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBI) functions as an electron-transporting
material (ETM), and LiF/Al as the composite cathode; of course, the
emissive layer in each case was cast with the bianthryls. I–V–L characteristics
and EL spectra of the devices fabricated with bianthryls in configuration
A are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. EL data for all the
devices are collected in Table 2.

As can be seen from Table 2, the turn-on voltages
are low (ca. 3.0–4.0 V), which
suggest that the energy levels of the employed materials are nicely
matched for the injection of holes and electrons, their transport,
and subsequent recombination. Both BABZF and BATOMe lead to white-light emission in the device configuration A. Although
blue emission is expected from all compounds based on their fluorescence
properties, emission of white light from the devices fabricated with BABZF and BATOMe is intriguing and a surprise.
The EL spectra of the corresponding devices span a significant part
of the visible region (cf. Figure 4). In fact, the EL captured for the BABZF-based device A has a full width at half-maximum of 184 nm with the
CIE coordinates of (0.28, 0.33) for the emitted light, which are close
to those of pure white-light emission (0.33, 0.33). In contrast, the BATOMe-based device in configuration A emits white light with
the CIE coordinates of (0.21, 0.29). Notably, the BABZF-based device performs significantly better than the one fabricated
with BATOMe (cf. Table 2). For example, the efficiency parameters for the BABZF-based device A are three times higher when compared
to those for the BATOMe-based device A (Table 2). Insofar as the maximum brightness
is concerned, the BABZF-based device produces a white
light of intensity 15 600 cd/m2, whereas the same
fabricated with BATOMe is limited to 2290 cd/m2. A similar device of configuration B in which m-MTDATA was employed as a HTM instead of NPB fabricated to affirm
the results obtained in device A. Indeed, BABZF-based
device B produced white light, albeit in relatively poor efficiencies
with slightly different CIE coordinates (cf. Table 2).

Next, we analyzed whether or not
the emitted white color is stable
in the usable potential range, as the color stability of a WOLED is
a measure of the quality of the device.2 In general, emissions from more than one species cumulatively lead
to white light, and hence relative emission intensities of the involved
species at different voltages determine the color stability of the
WOLED device over a range of potential. In Figure 5, the variation of CIEx and CIEy coordinates with voltage
for device A fabricated with BABZF is shown. Clearly,
the CIE coordinates remain steady with variation in the applied potential,
attesting to the stability of the emitted white light in the potential
range of 3–10 V.

Figure 5 Variation of CIEx and CIEy with voltage for device A.

As mentioned at the outset, bifunctional,
that is, hole transporting
as well as emissive, materials are of tremendous commercial importance
because of their dual role, which is important in economizing production
cost. Although benzodifuran derivatives32 have been reported to serve as HTMs in OLED devices, dibenzofuran
compounds have never been investigated as HTMs, to the best of our
knowledge. Given that both NPB-based device A and m-MTDATA-based device B produce similar white-light emission, we wondered
if elimination of the NPB/m-MTDATA layer and its
replacement by the BABZF layer of same thickness would
also lead to white-light emission. Accordingly, we fabricated a double
device of configuration C: ITO/BABZF (60 nm)/TPBI (40
nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm) to examine the dual property (hole transport
+ emission) of BABZF. To our delight, white-light emission
(CIE ≈ 0.28, 0.36) similar to that observed in device A was
indeed captured (cf. Figure 6). The efficiency parameters are, however, slightly inferior
to those obtained from multilayer device configurations (devices A
and B, Table 2, Figure S4). This can be understood from slightly
uphill hole injection barrier, arising as a consequence of deeper
HOMO energy of BABZF relative to that of NPB (5.6 vs
5.4 eV) (cf. Figure S5). Be this as it
may, the fact that white-light emission can indeed be captured from
a simple double-layer device with an unconventional non-nitrogenous,
yet bifunctional HTM has been realized for the first time.29−34 It is noteworthy that such a white-light emission from simple double-layer
fluorescent devices has been observed in only few instances, and the
results obtained with BABZF are superior to those reported
earlier.7,9−11 Fabrication of similar
devices with the methoxy-substituted compound, that is, BATOMe, to demonstrate the hole-transporting property led to very poor
results, presumably because of its inferior hole-injecting and hole-transporting
attributes.

configuration C.

What is the origin of
white-light emission? It is intriguing that
the observed light emission from the devices is white, although the
material itself is inherently blue-emissive. Intuitively, it must
be due to the emissions from multiple species that collectively lead
to broad emission. Let’s endeavor to understand the origin
of broad emission. First, the emission due to NPB in device A may
be ruled out because of the absence of its λmax (EL)
at ca. 412 nm.46 On the basis of the same
consideration, emission due to m-MTDATA may also
be discounted in device B. The λmax (EL) of TPBI
is well below 400 nm;47 thus, the emission
from TPBI cannot contribute to the observed EL spectra. The remaining
possibilities are emissions from BABZF and its excimer,
exciplex with TPBI, or electroplex. The peak at 448 nm for devices
A–C overlaps with the emission spectrum of the vacuum-sublimed
thin film of BABZF (Figure 7). Therefore, the peak at 448 nm is unambiguously
assigned to the singlet emission from BABZF. There have
been earlier reports about the occurrence of dual emission from the
locally-excited (LE) and the twisted intramolecular charge-transfer
(TICT) state of bianthracene.14,48 We performed single-point
energy scan of the excited and ground electronic states along the
torsional coordinate bridging the two anthracene rings in BABZF using Gaussian 09.49 We did not observe
two minima on either side of the Franck–Condon geometry at
a torsion of ca. 20° as has been reported for anthracene.45,48 On the contrary, the excited-state potential was flat and parallel
to the ground-state potential until steric interactions took over
at larger torsions (Figure S6). Such a
flat nature could predict the existence of dual-state emission. However,
TICT contribution would hardly increase in the device configuration,
as LE and TICT states lie very close to each other along the energy
and torsion dimensions. This is the main reason that the emission
spectra resemble significantly those of the solution phase and thin
film (Figure S7). Thus, any further red
emission from the device due to the LE/TICT state interplay can easily
be ruled out. The energy diagram of the BABZF/TPBI heterojunction
is shown in Figure 8a. Because of a high injection barrier for holes (ca. 0.8 eV), some
holes will be blocked by TPBI and hence accumulate at the interface.
Similarly, an electron injection barrier of ca. 0.2 eV will result
in some electrons being blocked by BABZF and accumulated
at the interface, whereas other electrons will tunnel through the
interface into the BABZF layer. This tunneling process
should result in the filling of LUMO of BABZF, which
eventually results in the radiative emission characteristic of BABZF peaked approximately at 448 nm.50 Presumably, the origin of the broadened emission spectra of the
devices is due to the excimers/exciplexes/electroplexes formed at
the interface with TPBI. To examine the possibility of excimer formation,
fluorescence spectra of BABZF were recorded in concentrated
DCM solution (ca. 1 × 10–3 M) as well as in
the thin-film state. In both cases, no emission at longer wavelengths
characteristic of excimer was observed, which rules out the possibility
of contribution of excimer to the observed EL spectra. We recorded
fluorescence spectra of a DCM solution of 1:1 mixture of BABZF and TPBI, which also did not reveal any longer wavelength absorption
that could be attributed to exciplex. However, it is possible that
they are weakly emissive, and their emission is subdued by the emission
from BABZF. For the possible exciplex emission at the
interface of BABZF and TPBI layers, eight different configurations
of the BABZF and TPBI molecules were sampled through
energy optimization at a lower level of Gaussian to choose the most
favorable geometry of the exciplex (Figure S8).14 Configurations in which BABZF and TPBI were aligned face-to-face in an H-aggregate fashion are
energetically most stable of all. Excited-state energy optimization51 of the most stable configuration predicts an
energy gap of ca. 2.25 eV (550 nm) between the electronic ground and
first excited states. We propose that the EL peak at ca. 570 nm is
most likely due to the exciplex formation between BABZF and TPBI of the type TPBI*BABZF at the interface between
the HTM and the ETM (Figure 8a). This exciplex is formed as a consequence of quantum mechanical
mixing between the LE complex and the charge-transfer complex of BABZF and TPBI. As briefly mentioned above, the potential
barriers between BABZF and TPBI result in the accumulation
of electrons and holes in the interface region accompanied by simultaneous
tunneling of the electrons, which increases significantly with increasing
the applied electric field. This leads to cross recombination of the
charge carriers with electrons primarily in the LUMOs of TPBI and
holes in the HOMOs of BABZF, which results in the emission
band slightly shifted toward the longer wavelength region peaking
approximately at 480 nm, known as an electroplex emission.50,52 This electroplex emission band lies nearer to the emission band
of BABZF because the LUMOs of TPBI and BABZF have a very small energy gap of ca. 0.2 eV, which does not give
rise to a larger shift in the emission band of the electroplex. The
multiple bands in the EL spectra of the device can thus be ascribed
to the monomolecular emission from BABZF peaking at ca.
450 nm, an electroplex emission at ca. 480 nm, and the low-energy
exciplex emission peaking at ca. 570 nm. It is noteworthy that the
efficiencies of emission from the involved species are different in
different devices, which ultimately determine the CIE coordinates
(cf. Table 2).

Conclusions
Two novel electroluminescent
materials, that is, BABZF and BATOMe, based
on a twisted bianthryl core were
designed and synthesized; these are thermally stable with high Tds and Tgs. Both
compounds exhibit a reversible redox property and are brilliantly
fluorescent with high quantum yields of emission. In the fabricated
nondoped devices, BABZF leads to white-light emission
(CIE ≈ 0.28, 0.33) with a moderate power efficiency of 2.24
lm/W and a very high luminance of 15 600 cd/m2.
The device exhibited excellent color stability over a range of applied
potential. Experimental as well as theoretical studies suggest the
possibility of multispecies emission involving BABZF and
its exciplex and electroplex in the devices. Remarkably, a similar
white-light emission was also captured in a simple double-layer device,
which is unprecedented. The results attest to the innate hole-transporting
ability of BABZF, despite the fact that it does not contain
any traditional hole-transporting di-/triarylamino group(s) in its
structure. Similar studies with BATOMe led to inferior
device performance results, suggesting the importance of dibenzofuran
group in BABZF. The findings described herein may serve
as a foundation for the creation of new non-nitrogenous HTMs, which
may lead to more efficient white light-emission in simple double-layer
devices.

Synthesis of BABZF
A mixture of toluene
(15 mL), EtOH (10 mL), and water (5 mL) contained in a two-necked
round bottom flask was degassed thoroughly by bubbling N2 gas for 10 min. To it were added 10,10′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthryl
(1.0 g, 1.95 mmol), dibenzo[b,d]furan-2-ylboronic
acid (1.65 g, 7.80 mmol), K2CO3 (1.08 g, 7.8

resultant mixture was heated at 110 °C for 2 d. At the end of
this period, organic solvents were stripped off in vacuo and the crude
mixture was extracted with chloroform three times. The combined organic
extract was dried over anhyd Na2SO4 and filtered.
The solvent was subsequently removed under reduced pressure to obtain
a crude mixture, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography
using a mixture of chloroform and pet ether (v/v 1:10 to 7:10) to
obtain BABZF as an off-white solid, yield 1.22 g (92%);

Synthesis
of BATOMe
A mixture of toluene
(15 mL), EtOH (10 mL), and water (5 mL) contained in a two-necked
round bottom flask was degassed thoroughly by bubbling N2 gas for 10 min. To it were added 10,10′-dibromo-9,9′-bianthryl
(2.0 g, 3.9 mmol), 3,5-dimethoxyphenylboronic acid (2.12 g, 11.7 mmol),
K2CO3 (1.6 g, 11.7 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.68 g, 0.6 mmol). The resultant mixture was heated
at 110 °C for 2 d. At the end of this period, organic solvents
were stripped off in vacuo and the crude mixture was extracted with
chloroform three times. The combined organic extract was dried over
anhyd Na2SO4 and filtered. The solvent was subsequently
removed under reduced pressure to obtain a crude mixture, which was
purified by silica gel column chromatography using a mixture of chloroform
and pet ether (v/v 1:10 to 1:2) to obtain BATOMe as a
yellowish solid, yield 2.23 g (91%); IR (KBr) cm–1: 3062, 3004, 2929, 2836, 1590, 1451, 1415, 1365; 1H NMR
