Magnetic nanoparticles are being
developed as structural and functional
materials for use in diverse areas, including biomedical applications.
Here, we report the synthesis of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) nanoparticles with distinct morphologies: single-core
and multicore, including hollow spheres and nanoflowers, prepared
by the polyol process. We have used sodium acetate to control the
nucleation and assembly process to obtain the different particle morphologies.
Moreover, from samples obtained at different time steps during the
synthesis, we have elucidated the formation mechanism of the nanoflowers:
the initial phases of the reaction present a lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH)
structure, which suffers a fast dehydroxylation, transforming to an
intermediate “undescribed” phase, possibly a partly
dehydroxylated lepidocrocite, which after some incubation time evolves
to maghemite nanoflowers. Once the nanoflowers have been formed, a
crystallization process takes place, where the γ-Fe2O3 crystallites within the nanoflowers grow in size (from
∼11 to 23 nm), but the particle size of the flower remains
essentially unchanged (∼60 nm). Samples with different morphologies
were coated with citric acid and their heating capacity in an alternating
magnetic field was evaluated. We observe that nanoflowers with large
cores (23 nm, controlled by annealing) densely packed (tuned by low
NaAc concentration) offer 5 times enhanced heating capacity compared
to that of the nanoflowers with smaller core sizes (15 nm), 4 times
enhanced heating effect compared to that of the hollow spheres, and
1.5 times enhanced heating effect compared to that of single-core
nanoparticles (36 nm) used in this work.

==== Body
Introduction
Through the polyol-mediated
synthesis developed by Fievet, Lagier,
and Figlarz,1 the formation of both noble
metals and metal oxide nanocrystals has been widely reported, obtaining
monodispersed systems thanks to the polyol acting as the surfactant
of the as-synthesized particles, reducer, and reaction media.2 The first advantage of this procedure is that
it allows the synthesis of hydrophilic particles that remain stable
in aqueous media3 and other polar solvents
within one step,4 avoiding further coating
steps required by other synthesis routes such as thermal decomposition
of organometallic precursors. In addition, owing to the high dielectric
constants of the polyols,5 they are able
to dissolve inorganic compounds used as reactants, and due to their
relatively high boiling points, great crystallinity of the particles
can be achieved.

Several examples of the synthesis of metal
nanoparticles (NPs)
achieved by this procedure exist in the literature. Among others,
functional materials, such as Au–Pd colloidal nanoparticles
for catalysis purposes6 and Co nanorods
for the development of new permanent magnets,7 have been recently synthesized. Besides noble metals, the synthesis
of both single-core (SC) and multicore magnetic nanoparticles8 has been reported through polyol reduction, organizing
colloidal magnetic cores into highly regular nanoparticles with tuned
properties. Of special interest are iron oxide multicore nanoparticles
assembled in flower-shaped structures synthesized by polyols.9,10 In comparison with the single-core counterparts, these flower-like
nanoparticles have shown enhanced longitudinal and transverse relaxivities
for magnetic resonance imaging contrast generation11 and enhanced specific absorption rate (SAR) values for
magnetic hyperthermia due to hysteresis heating.12 The interest in magnetite (Fe3O4)
and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) nanoparticles
for biomedical applications, both in diagnosis13 and therapy,14,15 relies on their biocompatibility16,11 and nontoxicity,17 chemical stability,
and the strong response when exposed to an external magnetic field.18

The assembly process and particle and
core sizes are crucial characteristics
that determine the magnetic properties of the colloid and therefore
its optimal use for a given application.19,20 In the present work, we have analyzed the assembly process that
leads to the formation of single-core and multicore hollow and flower-like
maghemite nanoparticles through the polyol process. We have also determined
the experimental parameters that allow control of the core sizes within
the nanoflowers (NFs). In detail, we have analyzed the role of specific
experimental conditions in the synthesis, such as the presence of
a precipitator (sodium acetate, NaAc), an extra stabilizer (poly(vinylpyrrolidone),
PVP), and the aging time. Then, the consequences of the different
morphologies and core sizes on the magnetic cooperative behavior have
been studied. Finally, some selected samples were coated with citric
acid (CA) and the possible use of these particles for magnetic hyperthermia
applications has been evaluated through specific loss power (SLP)
measurements.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ferric
chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, ≥98%;
Sigma-Aldrich), poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP40; Sigma-Aldrich), sodium acetate trihydrate (NaAc·3H2O, ≥99%; Sigma-Aldrich), ethylene glycol (EG, ≥99.5%;
Fluka), citric acid (C6H8O7, ≥99.5%;
Sigma-Aldrich), and agar (2%; Panreac) were obtained and used without
any further treatment.

Synthesis of Nanoparticles
The synthesis
of iron oxide
nanoparticles has been on the basis of a previous work described in
the literature,14 but the experimental
procedure and the concentration of NaAc and PVP have been varied.
Typically, 2.62 mmol FeCl3·6H2O was dissolved
with ultrasound in 109 mL of ethylene glycol. Then, 140 mmol PVP40
was added slowly under vigorous magnetic stirring (>1000 rpm) and
mild heating until completely dissolved. Then, 15.8–36.5 mmol
NaAc·3H2O was added to the solution. The mixture was
sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave (125 mL) and maintained at 200
°C for 0.5–48 h for solvothermal crystallization, followed
by cooling inside an oven. The precipitated solid product was washed
with ethanol and distilled water through centrifugation several times.

Surface Coating
For citric acid coating, a standard
procedure was used.8,21 First, sample volume equivalent
to 20 mg of Fe was adjusted to pH 2 and then dispersed in 13 mL of
a solution of 0.1 M citric acid. Afterward, the mixture was heated
at 80 °C for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged and washed
with distilled water. Finally, the pH was adjusted first to 11 with
1 M KOH and then to 7 with 0.01 M HNO3.

Characterization
The particle sizes and morphologies
were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEM1010
microscope (JEOL, Peabody) operating at 100 kV. Samples were prepared
by placing a drop of the uncoated particles suspended in water onto
a carbon-coated copper grid and allowing it to dry at room temperature
(RT). The size distributions were determined by manual measurement
of more than 100 particles using the public domain software ImageJ.

The crystal structure was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
performed on freeze-dried powders in an X’pert PRO diffractometer
from Panalytical with a Johansson monochromator and using Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The patterns were collected within
a 2θ range of 10–90° at a scan rate of 0.04°/min.
The crystallite size, dXRD, of the maghemite
samples was determined by Scherrer’s formula, using the (311)
diffraction line. The presence of the coating and the phase evolution
was also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
in the range of 4000–250 cm–1 by use of a
Bruker IFS 66VS. The samples for FTIR were prepared by diluting the
dried powder in KBr at 2% by weight and pressing it into pellets.

Colloidal properties were studied in a Zetasizer Nano S, from Malvern
Instruments (U.K.). The hydrodynamic size, Dh, was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the
ζ potential was measured as a function of pH at 25 °C using
HNO3 and KOH to change the pH of the suspensions. Dh is given as the intensity-weighted and number-weighted
mean value to compare to the TEM mean values.

For the magnetic
characterization, the samples were measured in
powder form after drying in an inox-coated oven at 50 °C. After
accurately weighing a mass of ≈10 mg, the powder was filled
into polycarbonate capsules and immobilized with cotton wool. Hysteresis
loops were measured in a vibrating sample magnetometer (MLVSM9, MagLab
9T; Oxford Instruments, U.K.) at 5 and 290 K in fields up to 4000
kA/m at a field change rate of 240 kA/m min after saturating the sample
in a 4000 kA/m field. Alternating current (AC) susceptibility measurements
were performed in a Quantum Design MPMS-XL superconducting quantum
interference device magnetometer using the same capsules described
above. Data was collected in the temperature range between 2 and 300
K using magnetic field amplitude of 0.41 mT and frequency of 11 Hz.
Additional measurements at 0.11 and 110 Hz were performed in selected
samples.

To further elucidate the composition of the samples
and their magnetic
properties, 57Fe Mössbauer spectra were obtained
in transmission geometry on freeze-dried samples at 18, 80, and 295
K, using a constant acceleration spectrometer from WissEl GmbH and
a flux-closed helium refrigerator from APD Cryogenics. Spectra have
been fit using Lorentzian-shaped lines. Isomer shifts are given relative
to that of α-Fe.

The evaluation of heat generation was
determined by a commercial
AC-field applicator (DM100; Nanoscale Biomagnetics, Spain). Samples,
either in water or in a viscous media (agar 2% w/v), were placed in
a closed container centered in the inductive coil and the AC-field
was applied for 5 min. The applied field amplitude was H = 24 kA/m, and the applied frequencies were 419, 542, and 710 kHz.
The temperature of the sample was recorded by an optic fiber sensor
incorporated in the equipment.

Results and Discussion
In this work, we have made use of the conventional polyol-mediated
route, utilizing an iron(III) salt in EG, followed by a solvothermal
reaction in the presence of PVP and NaAc, which yields multicore magnetic
NPs, also called magnetic nanocrystal clusters.22 Changes introduced in the experimental conditions (NaAc
concentration and heating time) have successfully allowed us to modulate
the NPs’ size and the size and configuration of the magnetic
cores.

For that purpose, some relevant parameters were initially
fixed
to assure the formation of monodispersed colloids with particle sizes
below 200 nm, which is a key issue to guarantee colloidal stability
and to make this suspension potentially more suitable for biomedical
applications. The first parameter is the choice of polyol and especially
its length, which has been shown to influence the size and the assembly
of the magnetic cores.23 In this work,
ethylene glycol (EG) has been selected, as it is a short polyol that
allows clustering such that multicore particles can be obtained. Polyols
with longer chains generally lead to single-core nanoparticles4,24 (depending on the rest of the reagents present in the reaction vessel).
The second parameter is the addition of PVP, which has been shown
to provide extra stability because it acts as a capping agent. The
third parameter is the iron/PVP concentration, which determines the
particle size. Polyol-based synthesis of iron(III) salts in an autoclave
using polyols of short chain and stabilizers such as PVP or poly(ethylene
glycol) usually leads to uniform particles of around 300 nm.14,25 The use of a base, namely, sodium hydroxide23 or urea,26,27 has accounted for a further reduction
of size. In this work, the iron/PVP concentration was fixed to achieve
particles smaller than 200 nm.

This section is divided in three
parts. First, the role of NaAc
in the growth and assembly process is evaluated. Then, the formation
mechanism of the nanoflowers is analyzed. Lastly, four samples with
different morphologies (different assembly configurations) and crystallite
sizes are selected and functionalized with citric acid such that they
form stable magnetic colloids and their different potential for magnetic
hyperthermia treatments are evaluated.

Role of Sodium Acetate
in the Assembly Process
The
amount of NaAc·3H2O was varied from 15.8 to 36.5 mmol
(Table 1) while maintaining
the rest of the reactants and conditions. Figure 1 shows the normalized log-normal size distributions
of the samples, obtained by manual measurement of the particle diameter
through ImageJ software and further data fitting using Origin software.
In all cases, monodispersed systems with narrow size distributions
were achieved thanks to the presence of PVP (the standard deviation
was below 25%). Figure S1 shows the particles
obtained in the absence of PVP with irregular morphology (mean size
of 200 nm and standard deviation of 48%). We found that the variation
of NaAc concentration leads to nanoparticles with distinctly different
structures (Figure 1). The highest concentration of NaAc (36.5 mmol) produced single-core
nanoparticles of 35 nm (sample SC, Figure 1a). These particles appear under the TEM
as randomly distributed and somewhat aggregated (possibly due to the
drying process on the TEM grid), but no specific assembly of the single-core
particles was observed.

Figure 1 TEM images of the different
structures obtained when varying the
NaAc amount: (a) single-core (SC) particles, 36.5 mmol; (b) hollow
spheres (HS), 26.2 mmol; and (c) nanoflowers (NF), 15.8 mmol. Below
are the normalized log-normal TEM size distributions of the samples.
Please note that in solution, the hydrodynamic diameters of the as-synthesized
samples SC, HS, and NF were 900, 700, and 300 nm, respectively.

distribution, and XRD size of maghemite nanoparticles with different
morphologies, including single-core (SC), hollow spheres (HS), and
nanoflowers (NF).

However,
when decreasing the NaAc concentration to 26.2 mmol, spherical
hollow multicore nanoparticles about 170 nm in diameter were formed
(sample HS, Figure 1b). TEM images reveals lower material density in the inner part,
which is attributed to the hollow structure.14Figure S2 further supports the existence
of voids within the spheres (again due to contrast between the darker
edges of the particle and the brighter centers). The lowest amount
of NaAc (15.8 mmol) yielded multicore particles with a flower-like
structure (sample NF, Figure 1c).

In this case, the cores (<20 nm) are densely
packed, forming
a nanoflower particle with a characteristic size of ∼60 nm.

In solution, as indicated in the figure caption of Figure 1, the intensity-weighted hydrodynamic
diameters of the as-synthesized samples SC, HS, and NF were 900, 700,
and 300 nm, respectively, well above the TEM size. This is due to
the presence of polyol and PVP, which was detected through FTIR spectroscopy
(Figure S6a); the low surface charge of
the as-synthesized samples (Figure 9b, dashed line); and as a consequence of their magnetic
character.

Figure 2 shows the
XRD patterns of samples SC, HS, and NF, which correspond to a ferrite
spinel structure attributed to γ-Fe2O3 (JCPDS #110614). An increase in the broadening of the Bragg peaks,
which indicates a decreasing crystallite size, is observed from SC
to HS and again to NF. The crystal sizes dXRD (Table 1) determined
by Scherrer’s equation agree well with dTEM in the case of single-core (SC) particles (dXRD = 36 nm), but in the case of NF and HS, dXRD is significantly smaller than dTEM. This discrepancy reflects the multicore nature of these
samples.19 From TEM and XRD, it is clear
that decreasing the amount of NaAc leads to more densely packed assemblies
with smaller core sizes.

Please
note that Ms obtained in this
work is formally the magnetic moment per unit mass (This is generally
termed as the specific magnetization, σ.) and the χ0 is calculated through the numerical field derivative of M. The samples have Ms values
between 80 and 90 A m2/kg at room temperature and go up
to 100 A m2/kg at 5 K. As with XRD, saturation magnetization
is larger for sample SC, than for samples HS and NF, i.e. MS increases with core size. Enlargement of the low-field sections
of the curves are shown in the insets to get a more accurate view
of hysteresis effects. Samples SC and HS show larger coercivity values
of 4.5 and 4 kA/m, respectively, at 290 K, in contrast to those of
sample NF that shows nearly zero coercivity and remanence at 290 K.
All samples, regardless of their structure, have coercivity values
between 14 and 17 kA/m at low temperature, which are of the same order
of magnitude as the coercivity reported for magnetite–maghemite
nanoparticles with only magnetocrystalline anisotropy.28 Also, the initial mass susceptibility (1.31–1.70
m3/kg) at room temperature and the low squareness ratio
(0.21–0.23) at 5 K are comparable for the three materials.

The above results show the fundamental role of NaAc in this synthesis
route because it directly defines the core size and morphology of
the samples and in turn leads to nanoparticles with different magnetic
behaviors. The reason underlies in the chemical process taking place.
It is known that both NaAc and water need to be present in the reaction
to modify the reduction potential of the polyol that otherwise is
not able to reduce the iron reactants.29 Moreover, its concentration defines the self-assembly process. Thus,
for the highest acetate concentration (0.3 M), massive nucleation
and uniform growth by diffusion take place, resulting in single-core
particles. When the amount of acetate is reduced (0.25 M), the initial
nuclei seem to grow by partial aggregation in hollow spheres.

Other studies have reported the formation of similar hollow spheres
by dissolution of inner small cores and growth of the larger ones
on the surface by the Ostwald ripening process.14 Further reduction in acetate (<0.2 M) leads to smaller
nuclei that strongly aggregate to produce the final flower-like particles.
In absence of NaAc, no precipitation occurred, as previously reported.30

Formation Mechanism of Multicore Nanoflowers
To study
the formation mechanism and magnetic properties of multicore nanoflowers,
the NaAc concentration (15.8 mmol) was fixed and the heating time
was varied from 0.5 to 48 h. All NF samples are named according to
their heating time (measured in hours). For this series of samples,
NF-16 is equivalent to sample NF studied above. First, electron microscopy
was used to study the evolution of nanoflower formation. Figure 4 shows the as-synthesized
product at the different reaction times. At short reaction times (<30
min), a reddish colloidal suspension is observed, consisting of primary
nuclei of 2–3 nm, unstable under the TEM electron beam. After
1.8 h, there is a reddish-brown precipitate, which corresponds with
nuclei that rarely approach and form aggregates that are poorly defined
(as distinctly observed in the inset image of Figure 4). After 2 h of aging time, the primary nuclei
seem to be transformed into a material with a laminar habit (sheets
that have lower contrast than that of the nanoflowers) and the first
nanoflowers (60 nm in size) are observed. The laminar phase disappears
after 4 h. The nanoflower size is preserved (dTEM ≈ 60 nm) between 2 and 48 h, see Table 3, but a clear increase of the
core size is observed over time. Thus, TEM images reveal two different
stages in the mechanism of flower formation. The first one is an initial
stage (<2 h of heating time) where several intermediate phases
may coexist. The second one (2–48 h) comprises the growth of
the cores within a nanoflower, which does not change in its total
size (≈60 nm). Figure S3 shows the
histograms obtained from TEM measurements of the nanoflower sizes.
This data was fitted to a log-normal size distribution (Figure S4), and it seems that the size distribution
gets narrower after longer periods of heating time. This is in good
agreement with a two-stage mechanism of nanoparticle formation by
self-assembly of diffusing aggregating nanocrystalline subunits, which
are in turn formed by burst nucleation in a supersaturated solution,
followed by coarsening.31 A detailed analysis
of both stages is provided in the following sections.

Figure 4 TEM images of NF samples
prepared with 15.8 mmol NaAc at different
reaction times: 1.8, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 48 h. Insets show a detailed
image of a single nanoflower.

a For all of these
syntheses, [NaAc]
was kept at 15.8 mmol.

Initial
Stages of the Flower Formation (<2 h)
To
identify the different phases that appear during these initial stages,
the composition of samples NF-0.5–2 were evaluated by XRD (Table 3). For all of these
syntheses, [NaAc] was kept at 15.8 mmol. Figure 5a shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of
the NF samples. At t = 0.5 h, the pattern clearly
matches that of lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) (2θ angles of
27, 36, 47, and 60°). A different pattern is observed at 1 and
1.8 h reaction time. These patterns do not correspond with any of
the well-known iron oxide or oxyhydroxide phases. As the patterns
are quite distinct, we speculate that they may represent the formation
of an unknown intermediate phase. At 2 h of reaction time, most of
the XRD peaks can be indexed to maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), whose typical XRD profile is shown in red below the diffractograms.
Additionally, there are two small and narrow peaks (at 24.6 and 47.2°)
that reveal some remains of the intermediated phase (in correspondence
with the observations by TEM). Figure S5 shows the XRD patterns of those samples collected after 6 months
of storage. It is noteworthy that although sample NF-0.5 is unstable
and tends to evolve to ferroxyhyte (FeOOH JCPDS #220353) over time
when at room temperature the unknown intermediate phases (NF-1 and
NF-1.8) remain stable after 6 months.

Figure 5 Formation mechanism of nanoflowers (NF)
followed by: (a) X-ray
diffraction. Expected peak positions of lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH,
green) and maghemite (γ-Fe2O3, blue) are
shown. (b) Mössbauer spectroscopy at 18, 80, and 295 K. Samples
were collected after 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.8 and 2 h of aging time.

Figure 5b shows
the Mössbauer spectra of NF powders in the initial stages, t = 0.5–2 h. The spectra of all four samples are
magnetically split at 18 K and have been fitted with two or three
sextets, with isomer shifts, δ, around 0.50 mm/s, indicating
that the samples consist of ferric phases. At 80 K and room temperature,
doublets dominate the spectra. Again, the isomer shift of the doublets
(∼0.45 mm/s at 80 K and ∼0.37 mm/s at room temperature)
as well as their quadrupole splittings (ε ∼ 0.6 mm/s)
indicate only ferric phases in all four powder samples. The spectrum
of NF-0.5 obtained at 18 K has been fitted with three sextets.

The most dominating sextet (shown in dark blue color) has broad
lines, a hyperfine field, Bhf, around
45 T, and ε of around 0.0 mm/s. This sextet is most likely due
to the presence of lepidocrocite, in agreement with the XRD and TEM
results. The Neel temperature of lepidocrocite is 77 K,32 but there appears to be quite a lot of magnetic
relaxation of lepidocrocite already at low temperature, indicated
by the broad lines and the blue sextet with the lower hyperfine field.
At 80 K and room temperature, lepidocrocite is paramagnetic and hence
seen as a doublet. The third sextet (orange) in the spectrum of sample
NF-0.5 has sharp lines, a hyperfine field Bhf of ∼50.6 T, and a quadrupole shift, ε, of −0.13
mm/s. The hyperfine parameters of this component match those of goethite,
although this (probably nanocrystalline) phase was not detected by
X-ray. At 80 K, a ferric (goethite) sextet (Bhf = 48.0 T, ε = –0.12 mm/s) with broad lines
remains, whereas the room temperature spectrum features no goethite
sextet, presumably due to superparamagnetic relaxation. This goethite
component occupies about 7% of the spectral area of NF-0.5 and is
not seen in the other samples.

The Mössbauer spectra
of NF-1 and NF-1.5 are very similar
to each other (in agreement with the XRD patterns of NF-1 and NF-1.8).
These Mössbauer spectra, where the outer sextets have Bhf ∼ 46.2–49.6 T, δ ∼
0.5 mm/s, ε ∼ 0.0 mm/s, could be assigned to ferrihydrite
or magnetically relaxing maghemite, but such assignment does not match
the XRD patterns, whose main peaks are not found to match an existing
phase (explicitly not ferrihydrite or maghemite). The Mössbauer
parameters match well with those of an (new) undescribed intermediate
phase in between that of lepidocrocite and maghemite, that is, a phase
that is dehydroxylated lepidocrocite (or “maghemite with hydroxyl
groups”). Mössbauer spectra obtained at 80 K in an applied
field of 0.5 T show no magnetic splitting, indicating that this phase
is paramagnetic at 80 K. Recent studies have shown the presence of
new intermediate phases that occur during the transformation between
iron oxides/oxyhydroxides that may not be stable enough to be easily
characterized. For example, an intermediate phase has been identified
in the transformation between two-line ferrihydrite and hematite,
which was termed as “hydromaghemite” or “ferriferrihydrite”.33 Although this phase has Bhf and δ values similar to those of the intermediate
phase observed in this work, the X-ray patterns do not match, which
means that we have captured a different “intermediate”
phase.

The 18 K spectrum of NF-2 is dominated by a maghemite
sextet (shown
in wine red), with Bhf = 52.6.0 T, ε
= 0.01 mm/s, and δ ∼ 0.5 mm/s. The asymmetry of this
sextet (between lines one and six) and its isomer shift strongly indicate
that it is ferric, that is, almost pure maghemite.34 At 80 K, part of the spectrum (∼20%) is relaxed
into a doublet but the majority of the spectrum is a sextet with relatively
sharp lines. Measurements obtained within an applied field (data not
shown) show that the relaxed part is paramagnetic, that is, presumably
due to the lepidocrocite or the intermediate phase. At room temperature,
the sextet contribution remains most of its spectral area but has
very broad lines. From this spectral behavior, a mixture of phases
is assumed (in agreement with XRD), that is, part of the sample is
paramagnetic already at 80 K (lepidocrocite), whereas the remaining
part of the sample (maghemite) shows slow relaxation even at room
temperature.

AC magnetic measurements have been performed to
follow the particle
formation (Figure 6), especially at the initial stage of 0.5 h, where the sample is
unstable under the TEM beam. For NF-0.5, the in-phase susceptibility
presents a Curie-like behavior down to 25 K, with a magnetic effective
moment per iron ion of about 2.6μB (Bohr magnetons),
calculated by assuming, for example, the formula of lepidocrocite.
The deviation of the in-phase susceptibility from the Curie law behavior
at low temperatures together with the rise of the out-of-phase component
suggests that magnetic blocking of very small nanoparticles takes
place below ∼20 K. For NF-1.8, the maximum of the in-phase
component together with the out-of-phase component step at ∼150
K indicates magnetic blocking of nanoparticles up to this temperature.
The location of these maxima, which are at higher temperatures than
in the case of NF-0.5, indicates the growth of the nanoparticles at
these early stages. Given that at this temperature, lepidocrocite
and the intermediate phase of NF-1 and NF-1.5 should be paramagnetic,
this feature may be caused by particles with considerable magnetization,
possibly being made of the undescribed intermediate phase in its advance
stage (1.8 h). For NF-2, the appearance of both components of the
AC susceptibility is typical of particles magnetically blocked well
above the room temperature, displaying susceptibility maxima at temperatures
above the measured range, in agreement with the observation of maghemite
flowers (∼60 nm) by TEM.

The results of TEM, XRD, Mössbauer
spectroscopy, and AC
susceptibility support that prior to formation of maghemite nanoflowers,
lepidocrocite with a laminar habit is formed, which transforms to
maghemite through an intermediate phase, probably that of dehydroxylated
lepidocrocite.

at 11 Hz for the initial stages (heating times 0.5, 1.8, and 2 h)
of the nanoflower formation. Please note the different susceptibility
scales in each plot.

Consequently, the formation mechanism is proposed to occur
as follows
at this initial stage 1   2   3   4  First, NaAc causes
a weak hydrolyzation (eq 1), which controls the release
rate of OH–. It has been reported that iron ions
could coordinate with the acetate anion (CH3COO–), forming a coordination compound that could evolve to magnetite
directly in the presence of EG that is oxidized to glycolaldehyde
(eq 4), a reductant capable
of reducing most noble metal ions.35 However,
in our case, because lepidocrocite and dehydroxylated lepidocrocite
have been suggested through XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy
as intermediate phases (samples NF-0.5–1.8), we propose that
the mechanism follows a sol–gel reaction, where the initial
γ-FeOOH nuclei are formed thanks to the sodium acetate releasing
OH– (eqs 2 and 3). The high temperatures, pressure,
and the action of sodium acetate allow the formation of lepidocrocite
by a burst type nucleation,36,37 which in this case
seems to occur rapidly (<0.5 h). After nucleation, there is phase
transformation (via dehydrolyzation) and aggregation, leading to maghemite
nanoflowers with a fixed size. To figure out whether the immediate
product is magnetite or maghemite is by no means a trivial issue.
On one hand, a reduction process (eq 4) can occur during the solvent-mediated transformation
to magnetite2 (2FeO(OH) + Fe(OH)2 → Fe3O4 + 2H2O), which is easily oxidized
maghemite. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated by Navrotsky
et al.38 that a direct size-driven transformation
of lepidocrocite to maghemite is thermodynamically possible (2FeO(OH)
→ γ-Fe2O3 + H2O). Our
results seem to support the thermodynamic considerations stated by
Navrotsky, and we conclude that this oxyhydroxide transforms directly
to maghemite,39 but we could not exclude
the initial presence of small amounts of Fe2+ in our samples
that will remain undetectable by further oxidation during the characterization
process.

Aging Process: Crystal Growth (2–48 h)
Once
the maghemite nanoflowers have formed, after 2 h of reaction time,
an aging process starts. This process has been studied through TEM,
XRD, and magnetic measurements. Figure 7a shows the XRD patterns collected for NF-2–48.
After 4 h, only maghemite is detected. The diffraction peaks become
narrower throughout the aging process, and the crystal size obtained
from the width of the diffraction peaks by use of the Scherrer formula
shows that the nanoflowers undertake a crystallization process, increasing
its mean crystal size dXRD from 11 to
23 nm (Figure 7b). A similar trend is observed by TEM, where
the cores of the particles are seen to grow over time (Figure 7c). Throughout the time, the
organic content of the samples is reduced (thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) is provided in Figure S7) from 12
to 4%.

Figure 7 Structure of the NF along the formation at t =
2–48 h: (a) XRD patterns, (b) core size calculated by Scherrer’s
equation. (c) representative TEM images of the growing cores.

Figure 8a illustrates
the whole progress of the formation mechanism and crystallization
of NF samples, which can be linked to eqs 1–4, where laminar lepidocrocite is formed and then transformed
to maghemite nanoflowers. This has been characterized magnetically
through direct current (DC) magnetometry and AC susceptibility. The
magnetic properties of the nanoflowers during the aging steps from
2 to 48 h were evaluated in detail (Figure 8b–e). By prolonging the aging time
(4, 8, 16, and 48 h), the nanoflowers’ saturation magnetization
is increased from 48 to 90 A m2/kg at 290 K (Figure 8b), which implies quite a significant
enhancement. The samples also show increasing coercivity values (∼0.5–2
kA/m at RT and 8–19 kA/m at 5 K) with aging. The initial mass
susceptibility at low fields (χ0) was calculated
for all samples through DC magnetometry from the numerical field derivative
of the magnetization (Figure 8c) (χ0 as calculated in Table 2). Samples NF-4, NF-8, and NF-48
have χ0 values of 2.3–2.5 m3/kg,
which is higher than those of SC and HS nanoparticles (χ0 for these samples is 1.7 and 1.35 m3/kg, respectively).
This enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility has been previously
linked to a magnetic cooperative effect due to aggregation of cores
forming densely packed nanoflowers.12 The
magnetic behavior of the progressively aged nanoflowers has also been
investigated by means of AC susceptibility (see Figure 8d,e). The results can be interpreted by considering
three contributions: (i) a positive in-phase susceptibility level
at room temperature due to the presence of rather large magnetic entities
with permanent magnetism, (ii) a wide and rounded out-of-phase maximum,
very likely indicating the blocking of magnetic entities of intermediate
size, and (iii) a low-temperature step in the in-phase component accompanied
by a rather sharp peak in the out-of-phase below ∼50 K. The
major contribution corresponds to the particles magnetically blocked
well above room temperature, already detected in sample NF-2, although
from t = 4 to 48 h, the magnitude of the resulting
in-phase susceptibility is significantly higher because paramagnetic
lepidocrocite dissolves in favor of other strong magnetic phases.
These samples present a much higher signal per mass of the sample
than NF-2 (Figure 6), in agreement with the disappearance of the lepidocrocite or the
intermediate phases observed by TEM and XRD at the longest reaction
times. For NF-4, NF-8, and NF-48, the magnitude of the room temperature
in-phase component decreases for increasing aging time. This result
well agrees with the field derivative of magnetization shown in Figure 8c. We believe this
value mostly results from the contribution of the large magnetic entities.
The magnetic dynamics of the lower temperature anomalies have been
investigated to interpret their nature (detailed discussion, Figure S8 and Table S1 from the Supporting Information
(SI)). The relative sharpness of the lowest temperature peaks, their
pre-exponential factors of the Arrhenius law, their regular dependence
with the aging time, and the occurrence also in iron oxide nanoparticles
prepared by completely different methods40,41 point to some phenomenon intrinsic to maghemite or to some usually
appearing intermediate phase, although no rigorous interpretation
of this phenomenon can be offered yet.

maghemite nanoflowers: (a) sketch of particle
evolution throughout the aging process, (b) DC magnetization curves
at 290 K of samples NF-2–48, (c) mass initial susceptibility
(χ0) of samples NF-2–48, and (d, e) temperature
dependence of the low-field AC susceptibility at 11 Hz, along the
formation of nanoflowers at 4, 8, and 48 h of aging time.

In summary, the analysis of the samples with longest
reaction times
indicates that lepidocrocite and the “undescribed” intermediate
phase have disappeared. Interestingly, increasing reaction times give
rise to a significant increase of the core sizes but not of the flower
size.

Biomedical Applications
We here evaluate aspects relevant
for biomedical applicability (especially colloidal stability and heating
potential for magnetic hyperthermia) of four selected samples: SC,
HS, NF-4, and NF-48, as these samples represent distinct different
morphologies (tuned by the NaAc concentration) and hold different
core sizes. The surface charge and the colloidal stability of samples
SC, HS, NF-4, and NF-48 were enhanced by citric acid coating. Infrared
spectroscopy confirms the successful citric acid coating from the
absorption bands typical of the carboxyl at 1384 and 1022 cm–1 (Figure S6 of SI). The hydrodynamic size
(Dh), polydispersity index (PdI), and
isoelectric points (IEPs) of as-synthesized and coated particles are
summarized in Table 4. The hydrodynamic sizes are smaller for the coated samples than
for the as-synthesized particles due to an increase in the surface
charge, as the shift of the IEP to lower pHs confirms (the NPs have
increased surface charge at pH 7). Figure 9a shows the change
in hydrodynamic size after the coating for sample NF-4. Dh for NF-4 changes from a polydispersed distribution to
a narrow monomodal distribution centered at ∼100 nm after the
coating, which is closer to the average particle size determined by
TEM (Table 1). Furthermore,
number-weighted Dh values for NF samples
(50–70 nm) do approach dTEM, as
this is number weighted. Similarly, a change to a more well-dispersed
system is also seen for sample NF-48 when coated with citric acid.
For samples SC and HS, the hydrodynamic size after coating is 161
and 298 nm, respectively, which is much larger than dTEM for sample SC and relatively larger than dTEM for sample HS, suggesting a certain degree of agglomeration
of the particles in suspension.

a Single-core (SC), hollow spheres
(HSs), and nanoflowers at different aging times (NF-4 and NF-28) coated
with citric acid (CIT).

Figure 9b shows
the measured ζ potential curve for sample NF-4. The citric acid
coating promotes the stabilization by repulsive forces42 because there is an increase of the surface
charge from −10 up to −40 mV at pH 7, assuring long-term
stability at physiological pH. We observe a similar increase of surface
charge for samples SC, HS, and NF-48. Moreover, there is, for all
samples, a shift of the isoelectric point (zero ζ potential)
to lower pH values that confirms the successful coating with carboxyl
groups for sample NF-4. This shift is larger in the nanoflowers, probably
due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio in comparison with the single-core
(SC) particles and the hollow spheres (HSs).

The heating capacity
of the coated materials in water at physiological
pH was evaluated to study the differences in terms of sample morphology
and crystallinity. Figure 10 shows the different specific loss power (SLP) values calculated
through “the slope method” (change of temperature over
time for different frequencies: 419, 542, and 710 kHz), for samples
SC, HS, NF-4, and NF-48. The specific loss power is found as 5  where c is the
capacity of
the suspension (typically assumed to be the heat capacity of the suspension
medium for low concentrations of MNPs).43 Nanoflowers with a core size of 23 nm (NF-48) have the highest SLP
values, for example, yielding 1131.2 W/g Fe for a frequency of 710
kHz. This sample displays SLP values nearly 5 times larger than those
of nanoflowers with crystal size of 15 nm (NF-4), nearly 4 times larger
than hollow spheres and 1.5 times larger than single-core nanoparticles,
although these two latter samples (HS and SC) have bigger core sizes
of 27 and 36 nm, respectively. This demonstrates that both core sizes
and the packing of the cores have decisive influence on the heating
capacity. Specifically, we observe that nanoflowers with large cores
(controlled by annealing) and densely packed cores (tuned by NaAc
concentration) offer enhanced heating capacity compared with nanoflowers
with smaller crystallite sizes, hollow spheres, and single-core nanoparticles
used in this work.

Figure 10 SLP values of samples of citric acid (CA)-coated SC, HS,
NF-4,
and NF-48. SLP values of different samples calculated by the slope
method. The field amplitude was 23.8 kA/m and three different frequencies
were applied: 419, 542, and 710 kHz.

Additional SAR measurements have been performed in viscous
media
(agar 2%). Although the obtained heating capacity for the SC and HS
samples does not change depending on the nanoparticle surrounding
media, samples NF- 4 and NF-48 present a significant change depending
on the solvent. The behavior of samples NF-4 and NF-48 resembles the
one observed before for similar magnetite nanoflowers, with a lower
performance in viscous media.15 It is remarkable
that whereas the heating performance of sample NF-48 drastically decreased
(37%), in the case of sample NF-4, the fall was slight (11%). This
result suggests how the difference in the core size (23 vs 15 nm for
maghemite NPs and thus in the range of the transition from the ferromagnetic
to the superparamagnetic regime) affects the SAR when comparing fairly
similar overall clusters.

Given the heterogeneity in the conditions
(field and frequency)
used to measure SLP by different research groups, and the multiple
possibilities of the materials characterized (with different particle
size, shape, structure (single-core or multicore), crystalline structure,
composition, etc.), it is complicated to find the most appropriate
examples in the literature to compare our data. For example, 30 nm
single-core magnetite nanoparticles, obtained by FeSO4 precipitation
and subsequent ageing, had an SLP value of 95 W/g (field amplitude
10 kA/m and frequency of 249 kHz).44 Our
SC sample, with a similar particle size, presents a higher SLP value
(257 W/g) with the lowest amplitude and frequency (22.8 kA/m and 419
kHz, respectively); however, the measurement conditions are not exactly
the same. Regarding hollow structures, liposomes (120 nm) encapsulating
magnetite particles (10 nm core size) presented an SLP value of 210
W/g.15 With the same conditions, the sample
HS has a similar SLP value of 301 W/g, although the core size and
the particle size are not exactly the same. In the frame of multicore
structures, materials obtained by coprecipitation of ferric and ferrous
chloride in a microwave, with a crystal size of 13 nm and hydrodynamic
sizes of 123 nm, similar to sample NF-4, had an SLP value of 190 W/g
(field amplitude 10.5 kA/m and frequency of 950 kHz).45 These values are similar to the ones obtained for sample
NF-4 at the most similar conditions measured in our case (232 W/g
with field amplitude 24 kA/m and frequency of 700 kHz). Measurements
in the same field and frequency conditions for a material similar
to sample NF-48 (magnetite nanoflowers of 22 nm obtained by the polyol-mediated
synthesis) yielded similar SLP data (1130 W/g for NF-48 and 1180 W/g
for the 22 nm nanoflowers). The obtained SLP data for our materials
envisages a possible use for magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment
of cancer; however, the lack of standardized measurement conditions
makes it complicated to compare the data with other existing materials.

The intrinsic loss power (ILP) of the samples was calculated from eq 6 6  It ranges from 0.5 to 0.6 (in the case of
samples NF-4 and HS, respectively), 1.9 (sample SC), up to 2.6 (sample
NF-48). Lastly, it must be noted that the product H·f was kept for all combinations below 4.85
× 108 kA/m s, which is mandatory for avoiding nonspecific
eddy heating in tissues.46

Conclusions
The polyol-mediated synthesis has been explored and developed for
the preparation of well-controlled magnetic nanoparticles with different
core sizes and arrangement to form the final single-core and multicore
particles. The particles are formed by burst nucleation and growth
processes that determine the final nanostructure going from single-core
to hollow spheres and nanoflowers, with high crystallinity, due to
the selected polyol synthesis route that uses high temperature over
long periods of time.

Sodium acetate is found to be a key parameter
governing the self-assembly
process. In this reaction, it has a double role: the particle formation
and the nucleation and growth. For higher acetate concentration, massive
nucleation and growth by diffusion takes place, resulting in single-core
particles. As the amount of acetate is reduced, the initial nanocrystalline
subunits seem to grow by partial aggregation in hollow spheres. Further
reduction in acetate leads to initial nanocrystalline nuclei that
strongly aggregate to produce the final flower-like particles.

The synthesis of magnetic nanoflowers occurs via burst nucleation,
growth by aggregation, and recrystallization that takes place over
time. The initial stages of the reaction are composed of lepidocrocite,
which suffers a fast dehydroxylation, transforming to an intermediate
undescribed phase, possibly a partly dehydroxylated lepidocrocite,
which evolves to maghemite nanoflowers. A prolonged heating of the
flowers leads to nanoflower particles with larger cores with interesting
magnetic and colloidal properties and consequently high heating capacities,
sample NF-48 being the one that displays the highest ILP value.

In the future, the transferred energy from an exciting magnetic
field to nanoparticles, leading to a dissipation of heat in targeted
bodies such as tumors, is likely to be explored much further. Taking
advantage of this physical phenomenon, magnetic nanoparticles are
also considered by many as potential chemotherapy and radiotherapy
enhancement agents, where a limited heat dissipation dose increases
the effectiveness in cell destruction. Our studies have outlined possible
ways to control the formation of distinct structures via polyol synthesis,
specifically the core sizes and arrangement have been tuned. This
indicates ways to tailor and optimize magnetic properties for specific
applications. On one hand, the most well-crystallined nanoflowers
(NF-48) have the highest heating capacity. On the other hand, nanoflowers
with core size above 15 nm (NF-4) combine high saturation magnetization
and initial susceptibility, while conserving low remanence at room
temperature, which can be suitable for specific biomedical applications
and also applications such as magnetic separation.
