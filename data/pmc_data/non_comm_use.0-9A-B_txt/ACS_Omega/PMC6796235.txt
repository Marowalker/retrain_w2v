G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane
receptors and targets for approved drugs. The analysis of GPCR expression
is, thus, important for drug discovery and typically involves messenger
RNA (mRNA)-based methods. We compared transcriptomic complementary
DNA (cDNA) (Affymetrix) microarrays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based TaqMan arrays
for their ability to detect and quantify expression of endoGPCRs (nonchemosensory
GPCRs with endogenous agonists). In human pancreatic cancer-associated
fibroblasts, RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays yielded closely correlated
values for GPCR number (∼100) and expression levels, as validated
by independent qPCR. By contrast, the microarrays failed to identify
∼30 such GPCRs and generated data poorly correlated with results
from those methods. RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays also yielded comparable
results for GPCRs in human cardiac fibroblasts, pancreatic stellate
cells, cancer cell lines, and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.
The magnitude of mRNA expression for several Gq/11-coupled GPCRs predicted
cytosolic calcium increase and cell migration by cognate agonists.
RNA-seq also revealed splice variants for endoGPCRs. Thus, RNA-seq
and qPCR-based arrays are much better suited than transcriptomic cDNA
microarrays for assessing GPCR expression and can yield results predictive
of functional responses, findings that have implications for GPCR
biology and drug discovery.

Introduction
G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs), a family of >800 membrane
proteins in humans, respond to a wide range of peptides, proteins,
lipids, metabolites, etc. and regulate a broad range of cellular processes
including proliferation, metabolism, and protein synthesis. There
are ∼360 GPCRs that are activated by endogenous agonists, i.e.,
endoGPCRs other than visual, taste, and olfactory receptors. EndoGPCRs
are targets for a large fraction (∼35%) of approved drugs.1 The detection of GPCRs in cells and tissues is,
thus, valuable for identifying GPCRs and defining their roles in cell
physiology and pathophysiology as well as for identifying opportunities
for drug discovery.

The detection of GPCRs by protein-based
methods is challenging.
Due to their low expression, GPCRs are difficult to assay by current
proteomic methods, plus the paucity of well-validated antibodies for
many GPCRs makes it problematic to detect them by immunological techniques.
As a consequence, the detection of GPCRs, especially in efforts to
profile their expression in cells and tissues, relies on assays of
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Multiple methods can assess mRNA
expression but their utility for defining GPCR expression has not
been assessed. We, thus, sought to evaluate GPCR expression by parallel
analysis of RNA samples from a single-cell-type: human pancreatic
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) tested with three different techniques:
TaqMan arrays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and transcriptomic complementary
DNA (cDNA) [e.g., Affymetrix (Affy)] arrays. Due to the low expression
of most GPCRs, even at the mRNA level, such a comparison is important
for evaluating data in public databases (e.g., CCLE2) that were generated using transcriptomic (Affymetrix)
arrays. Because of the limited dynamic range of such arrays, it is
unclear if that approach reveals accurate data regarding GPCRs. We
show here that Affymetrix arrays detect fewer GPCRs than either TaqMan
arrays or RNA-seq but that results from the latter two methods agree
closely in terms of identity and magnitude of GPCR expression. We
also provide independent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
validation of GPCR expression data from TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq
and evidence for the predictive value of data from the latter techniques
in terms of signaling and physiological response of Gq/11-coupled
GPCRs.

Here, we assess GPCR expression data for the following
human cells
and tissues: (1) pancreatic CAFs (using Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0
arrays, TaqMan arrays, and RNA-seq); (2) cardiac fibroblasts (CFs),
pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), and pancreatic stellate
cells (PSCs) (using TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq); (3) AsPC-1 pancreatic
cancer cell line (from CCLE, via Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 plus RNA-seq
and via TaqMan arrays in our laboratory); (4) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cell line (from CCLE via Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 and RNA-seq); (5)
ovarian cancer (OV) tissue and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
tissue (from TCGA, via Affymetrix HG U133a and RNA-seq). This large
number of sample types (also listed in Table S1), with data collected from different sources, facilitated a robust
comparison of GPCR detection and revealed prominent differences in
data generated by the different methods. These findings provide insights
regarding GPCR expression by various cell types, a rationale for the
interpretation of mined data regarding GPCR expression, and evidence
for the utility of mRNA expression data in predicting the functional
activity of one class of GPCRs (Gq/11-coupled GPCRs). Together such
information should aid studies of GPCR biology and drug discovery.

Methods
Cell Culture
and RNA Isolation
CAFs were isolated from
primary human PDAC tumors via explant and were grown, as described
previously.3 At low passage (<5), CAFs
were plated in 10 cm plates and grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Cells were lysed and RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Cat
# 74104, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), with on-column DNase-1 digestion
(79254, Qiagen). Purified RNA had 260/280 ratios ∼2 (via Nanodrop
2000c, ThermoFischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA integrity number
scores >9 (via Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA).
Human fetal cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were obtained from Cell Biologics,
Cat # H6049 (Chicago, IL) and grown in 10% CO2 at 37 °C,
in low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Cat # D60646 Gibco, Dublin, Ireland) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Cat # FB-02, Omega Scientific Inc., Tarzana, CA), 5 μg/L of
FGF2 (Cat # 130093838, Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, CA), 5 mg/L of
insulin (Cat # SC360248, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), 1
mg/L of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (Cat # 07904, Stemcell Technologies
Inc., Cambridge, MA), and 50 mg/L of ascorbic acid (Cat # A454425G,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells
(PASMCs) were obtained from Lonza (Cat # CC-2581, Walkersville, MD)
and were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in low-glucose
DMEM with 5% FBS, epidermal growth factor (5 ng/mL), FGF2 (5 ng/mL,
Cat # 130093837, Miltenyi Biotec), insulin (same as above), and ascorbic
acid (50 μg/mL). Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) were purchased
from ScienCell Research Laboratories (Cat # 3830; ScienCell Research
Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) and cultured according to the manufacturers’
instructions.

qPCR
RNAs were converted to cDNA
via the Superscript
III kit (Cat # 18080050, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). cDNA
was then mixed with gene-specific primers (2 μM) and Perfecta
SYBR green SuperMix reagent (Cat # MP9505402K, VWR, Radnor, PA) for
PCR amplification using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research,
St. Bruno, QC, Canada). Primers were designed using the Primer3Plus
software. The primer sequences are listed in Table S3.

RNA-seq
RNA sequencing was performed
by DNAlink Inc.
(San Diego, CA for CAF samples) or the UCSD IGM core (for CF and PASMC
samples), using TruSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) stranded mRNA library
preparation, with sequencing on a Nextera 500 (for CAF samples) or
a HiSeq 4000 (CF and PASMC samples) at 50 (CFs and PASMCs) or 75 (CAFs)
base-pair single reads. Data were analyzed via Kallisto v0.43.14 using the Ensembl GRCh38 v79 reference transcriptome,
with 100 bootstraps, to obtain transcript-level expression in transcripts
per million (TPM). Kallisto bootstraps were read in R via Sleuth;5 GPCR data for each bootstrap were evaluated as
described below to quantify the uncertainty of GPCR expression quantification.
Gene-level expression in TPM was calculated using Tximport.6 For the comparison of expression ratios of gene
expression between samples, gene-level estimated counts data from
tximport were input into edgeR,7 to obtain
normalized gene expression in counts per million (CPM). RNA-seq raw
data are available at National Center for Biotechnology Information
Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI GEO), at accession numbers GSE101665 and GSE125049.

TaqMan Arrays
cDNA was diluted with double-distilled
H2O and mixed with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Cat
# 4304437, Life Technologies, Waltham, MA) to a final concentration
of 1 mg/mL and assayed for GPCR expression using TaqMan GPCR arrays
(Cat # 4367785; Life Technologies) by a 7900HT fast real-time system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were analyzed with the RQ Manager
software (Life Technologies). Gene expression was normalized to that
of 18 S ribosomal RNA as ΔCt; the results were consistent if
normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or
other housekeeping genes;8 based on previous
studies, we set the TaqMan GPCR array detection threshold to a ΔCt
value (relative to 18 S) ≤25.3,8,9

Affymetrix Arrays
RNA samples were
submitted to the
Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics at UCLA for analysis
via Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays. Data as cel files were analyzed
by both the MAS5 and RMA methods to quantify gene expression. The
analysis was performed via the R “affy” package10 to yield intensity estimates for each probe
set, along with detection p-values and present/absent
calls (for the MAS5 method). For a GPCR to be considered “detected”
in Results section, the Mas5 call was required
to indicate present (“P”) for at least one probe set
for a given gene. In the event that multiple different probe sets
for the same GPCR indicated a P call (with corresponding p-values <0.05), we used the expression from the probe set indicating
the highest MAS5 expression intensity, which yielded expression-ratio
estimates between replicates consistent with RNA-seq and qPCR, as
detailed further in Results section. In general,
log 2 Mas5 intensities >5 correspond to “present”
calls (see Figure 6 and accompanying text on the dynamic range for further details).
Affymetrix data are available at NCBI GEO, at the accession number GSE124945.

Data Mining
TCGA data for ovarian cancer (OV) and lung
squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) assayed by RNA-seq were downloaded
from xena.ucsc.edu, as estimated gene counts and TPMs for each gene
in each TCGA sample, analyzed via the TOIL pipeline.11 TCGA data for OV and LUSC, assayed by Affymetrix HG U133a
arrays, were obtained from GEO (accession numbers GSE68661 and GSE68793 for
OV and LUSC, respectively) and were analyzed in R, using the methods
described above for Affymetrix arrays. For the computation of expression
ratios between samples, estimated counts from the TOIL pipeline were
input into edgeR, to obtain normalized gene expression in CPMs, allowing
for the comparison of expression ratios for genes between pairs of
samples. RNA-seq data from the CCLE2 for
cell lines were downloaded as gene expression in TPMs from the EBI
expression atlas,12 from data provided
on that portal, analyzed via the iRAP pipeline.13

Cellular Calcium Assays
Intracellular
calcium concentration
of AsPC-1 cells was measured using the FLIPR-4 calcium assay reagent
(Cat # R8142, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). In brief, cells were
plated in black-walled clear-bottom 96-well plates overnight at ∼80%
confluency using media and conditions described in Methods. Culture media was then removed and cells were incubated
for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in FLIPR-4 loading buffer,
consisting of FLIPR-4 reagent diluted (as per the manufacturer’s
instructions) in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (with
calcium and magnesium) buffered with 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid and 0.2% bovine serum albumin,
with pH adjusted to 7.4. Loading buffer also contained probenecid
(2.50 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat # P8761) to prevent leakage of the calcium
reagent from the cells. Calcium response was then measured via a FlexStation
3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). GPCR agonists
were added, and response in relative fluorescence units was measured
over 105 s for each well, yielding data for peak response and kinetics
of response. For calcium assays and wound-healing assays, we used
the following GPCR agonists: Neurotensin (Cat # 1909, Tocris, Minneapolis,
MN); 2-Thio-UTP (Cat # 3280, Tocris); histamine (Cat # AAJ6172703,
Fischer Scientific); oxytocin (Cat # 1910, Tocris); and sulprostone
(Cat # 14765, Cayman Chemical).

Migration/Wound-Healing
Assays
Rate of migration of
AsPC-1 cells was estimated using a scratch-wound assay. Cells were
plated in 24-well plates and grown to approximate confluency. A scratch
was made in each well using a 200 μL pipette tip, culture media
was replaced to remove floating cells, and the scratches were imaged
using a BZ-X700 microscope. Cells were then incubated with GPCR agonists
at concentrations described in the following sections and were returned
to a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 h, the same
scratches were imaged once again. The area of scratches at the 0 and
24 h time points was then calculated via standard protocols in ImageJ
v1.52a to evaluate wound closure. Migration data were analyzed for
statistical significance using the Prism Graphpad (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA) via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey
multiple comparison testing.

Results
Comparison
of GPCR Expression Data for Pancreatic CAFs
Table S2 (top) shows the number of GPCRs
each method can detect, based on limitations of the number of primers
(TaqMan arrays) or probes (Affymetrix arrays). Both methods should
allow the detection of a similar number of endoGPCRs. TaqMan arrays
are not designed to detect chemosensory GPCRs, and Affymetrix arrays
also have relatively few probe sets for chemosensory GPCRs. Figure 1 and Table S2 (bottom) show that the number of endoGPCRs
in pancreatic CAFs detected by RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays is greater
than is detected by Affymetrix arrays. The threshold of detection
used for determining whether a GPCR was detected in RNA-seq data was
set to 0.2 TPM, based on the analysis discussed in Figure S1 and accompanying text. Detection thresholds for
TaqMan arrays and Affymetrix arrays are discussed in Methods section.

Figure 1 Detection of GPCRs by RNA-seq, TaqMan GPCR arrays,
and Affymetrix
(Affy) arrays. (a–c) GPCRs for which the relevant primer probes
are present by each method. Representative data are shown for an individual
CAF replicate as an example; similar numbers were detected by all
three methods in a second replicate. (d) Differences in GPCR expression
between RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays. (e) False-positive detection of
GPCRs from Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays; these GPCRs were detected
by neither RNA-seq (plotted above) nor TaqMan arrays (not shown).
(f) False negatives from Affymetrix arrays that we detected by the
other methods; expression is plotted for such GPCRs identified by
RNA-seq.

RNA-seq identified the greatest
number of GPCRs, likely because
this method is not limited by a fixed number of probes/primers. RNA-seq
and Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays both detect a small number of
chemosensory GPCRs; their level of expression was typically just above
the detection thresholds defined above and in Methods section. Both RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays identified in common most
of the detected GPCRs. Virtually all highly expressed GPCR identified
by either TaqMan arrays or RNA-seq were commonly detected by both,
whereas Affymetrix arrays detected fewer GPCRs in common (Figure 1a–c). GPCRs
uniquely identified by each method were typically expressed at very
low levels, i.e., near detection thresholds. Eight endoGPCRs were
detected by RNA-seq but not by TaqMan arrays due to the absence of
corresponding primers on the TaqMan arrays.

The overall agreement
between TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq is further
illustrated in Figure 1d–f: the 21 GPCRs detected by TaqMan arrays but that were
below thresholds for the detection by RNA-seq were all expressed at
>22 cycles above 18 S (i.e., >∼33 qPCR cycles), implying
low
expression levels of these receptors by either method (Figure 1d). Thus, all highly expressed
GPCRs identified by TaqMan arrays are also detected by RNA-seq. We
found a small number of apparent false positives from Affymetrix data,
i.e., GPCRs not detectable by either TaqMan arrays or RNA-seq (Figure 1e) and numerous false
negatives from Affymetrix data (GPCRs detected by RNA-seq and/or TaqMan
arrays) (Figure 1f).
The apparent false positives in the Affymetrix data were relatively
low-expressed (Log 2 MAS5 intensity <7). TaqMan arrays and
RNA-seq show a relatively high correlation (R2 > 0.8) in the magnitude of GPCR expression (Figure 2a) but data from Affymetrix
arrays correlate poorly (R2 < 0.4)
with results from TaqMan arrays (Figure 2b) and RNA-seq (shown for various cells/tissues
in subsequent sections).

TaqMan GPCR arrays,
and Affymetrix (Affy) arrays with independent qPCR and comparisons
of expression changes. (a) Data from RNA-seq compared to that of TaqMan
arrays; (b) data from Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays compared to
that of TaqMan arrays. Representative data are shown for an individual
CAF sample. (c) Validation of TaqMan GPCR array data by qPCR, for N = 5 CAF samples; the data shown are mean and standard

between expression ratios of GPCRs in two CAF samples (CAF2 and CAF3)
evaluated by (d) RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays and (e) Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0
and TaqMan arrays. (f, g) Number of GPCRs in two CAF samples as detected
by (f) TaqMan arrays and (g) Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays.

Independent qPCR using SYBR green and primers designed
in our lab
was used to validate GPCR expression measured by the three methods. Figure 2c shows the average
expression of 10 GPCRs in CAFs derived from five different patients,
assayed via independent qPCR and the correspondence of these data
with TaqMan array data. We found a high degree of correspondence with
results from TaqMan arrays and qPCR (R2 ∼ 0.8) and between results from RNA-seq and qPCR (R2 ∼ 0.8, not plotted) but not from Affymetrix
arrays and qPCR (R2 < 0.5, not plotted).

Although Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays did not provide gene
abundance estimates comparable with either RNA-seq or qPCR-based arrays,
if one estimates expression ratios among biological replicates (an
indication of how much a gene’s expression differs among samples),
results for all three methods are in close agreement. Figure 2d,e shows this for ∼40
GPCRs commonly detected in two CAF samples by all three methods: expression
differences among samples are nearly equal for the three methods.

Are these methods equally useful for evaluating changes in expression
between samples? Figure 2f,g shows the overlap of detected GPCRs for two biological replicates
(CAF2 and CAF3) assessed by TaqMan arrays (RNA-seq performs nearly
identically3) and Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0
arrays. A smaller proportion of detected GPCRs was observed for n replicates tested by the Affymetrix arrays. Fewer GPCRs
are consistently detectable by Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays; the
estimation of changes in GPCR expression is, thus, less feasible than
with the other methods. However, for GPCRs that one can consistently
quantify by Affymetrix arrays, estimates of differences in their expression
are consistent with those of the other two methods. Figure 6 (and accompanying text) shows
quantitative analysis for the dynamic range of detection of GPCRs
by each method, from data in CAFs. Affymetrix arrays have a narrower
dynamic range than TaqMan arrays or RNA-seq, which both show very
similar behavior. In addition, the correlation for all genes, in general,
between RNA-seq and Affymetrix arrays appears poor.

Comparison
of GPCR Expression Estimates in Other Cell Types
We obtained
a similarly high degree of correspondence between TaqMan
array and RNA-seq data in other cell types. Figure 3a–c shows the detection of GPCRs by
TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq in human cardiac fibroblasts, pancreatic
stellate cells (PSCs), and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells
(PASMCs). Most GPCRs are identified by these two methods in all three
cell types. Similar to the data from CAFs, the GPCRs commonly detected
by both TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq include all highly expressed GPCRs
(e.g., those expressed >10 TPM). Thus, GPCR expression analysis
by
TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq is consistent in a variety of primary cell
types.

detectable by RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays in individual human lines

(d−f) The number of GPCRs expressed by the AsPC-1 pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma cell line (determined by Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0
arrays; CCLE), TaqMan GPCR arrays (Insel Lab), and RNA-seq (CCLE and
EBI). (g, h) GPCR expression of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (determined
by Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays and RNA-seq; CCLE). (g) Correlation
in the GPCR detection by the two methods for the 62 commonly detected
GPCRs. (h) The number of commonly or uniquely identified GPCRs using
RNA-seq or Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays. (i) For CCLE data, expression
in AsPC-1 cells of five Gq-coupled GPCRs tested for functional effects
in Figure 7, linearized
(for Mas5 data) and normalized to the expression of NTSR1, the highest
expressed of these receptors as per RNA-seq data.

To further test Affymetrix arrays with the two other methods, we
assessed the expression of GPCRs in AsPC-1 PDAC cells using TaqMan
arrays and compared these data with RNA-seq and Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0
array data for the same GPCRs from data in CCLE.2 We found that our TaqMan array data and the CCLE RNA-seq
data showed much better correspondence than did the CCLE Affymetrix
data to either of those methods/sources (Figure 3d–f). Thus, GPCR expression determined
by RNA-seq and TaqMan arrays assayed at different laboratories, batches
of cell lines, media, etc. shows greater concordance than GPCR data
from RNA-seq and Affymetrix arrays, for samples prepared in the same
laboratory.

We also assessed data for another cell line (MDA-MB-231
breast
cancer cells) from CCLE and the tumor tissue from TCGA. We compared
data from CCLE using Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays and found a
similarly poor correlation between GPCR expression assayed by the
Affymetrix arrays compared to RNA-seq (Figure 3d,e). Fewer GPCRs were detected by the Affymetrix
arrays than by RNA-seq, and the magnitudes of GPCR expression were
poorly correlated (R2 = 0.58). Figure 3i shows the expression
in AsPC-1 cells (from CCLE data) of 5 Gq/11-coupled GPCRs determined
by RNA-seq and Affymetrix arrays; these GPCRs were, subsequently,
studied for their functional effects (Figure 7). RNA-seq reveals a range of expression
levels between these GPCRs, with NTSR1 and P2RY2 very highly expressed,
while the other highlighted receptors had lower expression. By contrast,
data from Affymetrix arrays implied a similar, very high level of
expression for four of these GPCRs. Consistent with the RNA-seq data,
data from TaqMan arrays also showed that NTSR1 and P2RY2 are especially
highly expressed in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (not shown), while
the other receptors had lower expression.

Comparison of GPCR Expression
Estimates in the Tumor Tissue
We next tested how well RNA-seq
and the Affymetrix arrays compare
in the assessment of GPCR expression in human tissues and in the ratios
of GPCR expression in pairs of samples. For this comparison, we used
gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for lung
squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and ovarian cancer (OV) tumors. As
we observed for cells, the two methods compare poorly in terms of
number of GPCRs detected and magnitude of expression of individual
GPCRs in the tissue samples. Figure 4a–d shows the relationship between RNA-seq and
Affymetrix HG U133a array data from the same tumor/donors for representative
LUSC and OV samples with poor correspondence for data by the two methods
(R2 = 0.19 for LUSC and R2 = 0.26 for OV). RNA-seq identified many more GPCRs,
but even for GPCRs detected by both methods, there was a poor correlation
in the magnitudes of expression between the methods. The HG U133a
arrays are an older, less comprehensive (i.e., a smaller number of
probes) product than the HG U133plus2.0 arrays we tested with CAF
samples, but large amounts of archived gene expression data use these
or older arrays. Such archived data should, thus, likely be avoided
for evaluating GPCR expression.

Figure 4 Comparison of GPCR expression data in
TCGA samples generated by
Affymetrix arrays and RNA-seq. (a, b) The correlation of expression
of commonly detected GPCRs and (c, d) Venn diagrams showing the overlap
in GPCR expression of randomly selected tumor samples assessed by
Affymetrix HG U133a arrays or RNA-seq of ovarian cancer (OV; TCGA24-1418-01)
and LUSC (TCGA-37-4141-01) tumor samples in TCGA. (e) The correlation
of expression ratios and (f) Venn diagrams of GPCRs detected by RNA-seq
or Affymetrix HG U133a array for a randomly selected pair of TCGA
OV samples.

The assessment of GPCR expression
between random pairs of tumor
sample replicates reveals relatively poor ability to detect GPCR expression
by Affymetrix HG U133a arrays compared to RNA-seq (Figure 4e,f). The ratios of expression
also do not correlate between the two methods, thus providing further
evidence that data from older generations of Affymetrix arrays are
unlikely to yield accurate data regarding GPCR expression.

Evidence
for GPCR “False Negatives” in TCGA Tumor
Affymetrix Data
As noted in the examples shown for ovarian
serous carcinoma (OV) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) in TCGA
data (Figure 4), numerous
GPCRs are detected in tumors by RNA-seq but not Affymetrix arrays.
Data in the literature document a functional role for many of these
GPCRs, thus supporting the idea that these failures to detect GPCRs
in Affymetrix data constitute false-negative results. Examples of
such GPCRs in OV include the smoothened homologue receptor (SMO),
which drives hedgehog signaling.14 SMO
has been implicated as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer
with substantial data implying a functional role for SMO.15−17 However, Affymetrix arrays yield poor evidence for the detection
of this gene, whereas RNA-seq reveals substantial expression. CXCR3,18,19 CXCR6,19,20 CXCR5,19,21 and S1PR222 are additional examples of GPCRs with demonstrated
functional effects in OV tumors that are detected by RNA-seq data
but not by Affymetrix microarrays. Similarly, in LUSC, SMO, CXCR6,
CXCR3, and CXCR5 are false negatives from Affymetrix data but are
detected by RNA-seq and are functional GPCRs23−27 in LUSC.

RNA-Seq Data Suggest That Splice Variation
Occurs among GPCRs
An additional advantage of the use of
RNA-seq to assess GPCR expression
is its ability to identify alternatively spliced transcripts, a largely
unexplored aspect for GPCRs. Approximately, 45–50% of GPCRs
are intron-less, which may explain why splice variation in GPCRs has
not been studied in detail.28,29 We found that many
GPCRs, in particular adhesion GPCRs, which have a large number of
exons, may undergo alternate splicing. Figure 5a shows the number of GPCRs and those that
express multiple splice variants in a human pancreatic CAF sample.
Nearly, half of all identified GPCRs appears to show alternative splicing.
As an example, ADGRE5/CD97, an adhesion GPCR, appears to have at least
five meaningfully expressed splice variants (Figure 5b). These data were obtained at moderate
sequencing depth; to more precisely identify the presence of particular
splice variants in individual samples and cell types, one requires
a greater sequencing depth (e.g., sequencing with 150 base-pair, paired-end
reads). Subsequent studies would then be needed to define the biological
activity of such variants. Of the three methods used here, only RNA-seq
can define alternative splicing of GPCRs and with bioinformatics tools
(such as Kallisto4) can quantify transcript
levels. Figure 5c shows
the number of detected variants for each GPCR where we noted evidence
for splice variation.

Comparison of the Dynamic
Range between Methods
To
determine how the detection of GPCRs compares with that of the expression
of all protein-coding genes, we compared the dynamic range of detection
for those genes by Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays and RNA-seq. For
estimating the dynamic range of detection for GPCRs, we also included
TaqMan GPCR arrays. We found (Figure 6a) that RNA-seq detects
more genes but RNA-seq and Affymetrix arrays largely detect the expression
of the same genes. The latter finding contrasts with the results for
GPCRs and likely results from the relatively low expression of some
GPCRs and the limited ability of Affymetrix arrays to detect low abundance
transcripts. For most other genes/mRNAs, especially those with intermediate
or high expression, the two methods perform similarly, although the
magnitude of expression of commonly detected genes does not correlate
well between the two methods (Figure 6b).

Figure 6 Gene expression and the dynamic range of detection by
different
methods. (a) Venn diagram of the detection of all protein-coding genes
by Affymetrix HG U133plus2.0 arrays and RNA-seq in pancreatic CAFs.
(b) Correlation of expression values for commonly detected genes by
both the methods. (c, d) Cumulative distribution functions (CFDs)
showing (c) the dynamic range of RNA-seq and Affymetrix arrays (HG
U133plus2.0) for all genes; (d) the same as (c), but for GPCRs, detected
by RNA-seq, Affymetrix arrays, and TaqMan arrays.

Figure 6c shows
the dynamic range of detection for all transcripts by RNA-seq and
Affymetrix arrays; gene expression was normalized to log 2
units (i.e., log 2 of TPM expression for RNA-seq and MAS5 intensity
for Affymetrix arrays). We added a small constant to RNA-seq expression
values, so that the log 2 of the highest expression value in
TPM = log 2 of the highest expression value in MAS5 intensity.
To evaluate the dynamic range for detection by each method, we computed
the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for each set of expression
values. RNA-seq had a larger detection range (∼50-fold) and
could detect genes ranging from ∼15 to ∼0 adjusted log 2
TPM, whereas Mas5 log 2 intensities ranged from ∼15
to ∼5. Figure 6d shows a similar trend for GPCRs with respect to the dynamic range
for RNA-seq, TaqMan arrays, and Affymetrix arrays. GPCR expression
was normalized as log 2 units (as above) with a small normalization
factor added to TaqMan array data and RNA-seq data, so that log 2
expression of GAPDH (in all three datasets as a housekeeping gene)
was equal and served as the first point (from the right) on the CDF.
As the highest expressed gene that was commonly detectable across
all three platforms, GAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene for this
comparison. The range of expression levels between GAPDH and the lowest-detectable
level of GPCR expression allows us to define and compare the dynamic
range for each assay. TaqMan arrays and RNA-seq had a similar dynamic
range, consistent with the high degree of correlation between the
two methods; the dynamic range was lower with Affymetrix arrays.

GPCR mRNA Expression Shows Concordance with Signaling and Functional
Response
To validate the GPCR expression data, we tested
whether the level of mRNA expression can predict GPCR response with
respect to signaling and functional activities. We opted to study
a set of GPCRs which couple to Gq/11 Gα proteins, thus signaling
via increases in intracellular calcium: the neurotensin receptor (NTSR1),
the P2Y2 purinergic GPCR (P2RY2), the histamine H1 receptor (HRH1),
the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), and the EP1 prostaglandin receptor (PTGER1),
spanning a range of expression (assayed via RNA-seq in CCLE2) from >100 TPM (NTSR1) to 1 TPM (PTGER1) in
AsPC-1
pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 7a). All five GPCRs have well-known
agonists that act via Gq/11:14 neurotensin
(NTSR1), 2-Thio-UTP (P2RY2), histamine (HRH1), oxytocin (OXTR), and
sulprostone (PTGER1). Each agonist should activate the specified receptor
due to their known pharmacology and based on the GPCRs expressed in
AsPC-1 cells. For example, HRH1 is the only HRH receptor, OXTR is
the only vasopressin and oxytocin receptor family member expressed
and among targets for sulprostone, PTGER1 is the only one expressed
in AsPC-1 cells. Similarly, P2RY2 is the only purinergic GPCR expressed,
which is activated by 2-Thio-UTP.

calcium [“calcium response”, relative to 5 μM

by RNA-seq in CCLE2). Data shown are the
mean and SEM from three independent experiments. (b) Concentration–response

individual wells in a 96-well plate; other replicates showed similar
behavior. (d) Impact of treatment with GPCR agonists on the migration
of AsPC-1 cells over 24 h; N ≥ 6 for each
treatment. Agonist concentrations were: oxytocin (5 μM); histamine
(10 μM); 2-Thio-UTP (0.5 μM), neurotensin (0.1 μM);
*: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.001;
***: p < 0.0001; significance was evaluated via
one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison testing. (e) The relationship
between the increased rate of migration and GPCR expression [as in
panel (a)]. (f) The relationship between maximal calcium response
promoted by the GPCR agonist concentrations indicated in (d) and the
increase in the rate of migration of AsPC-1 cells.

We first tested the calcium response (i.e., the increase
in cytosolic
calcium) in AsPC-1 cells for each agonist, over a range of concentrations. Figure 7a shows the peak
(“maximal”) calcium signal recorded for each ligand
[at saturating concentrations (Figure 7b)] as a function of the magnitude of expression of
its cognate GPCR target. We observed a sigmoidal behavior, wherein
the calcium response plateaus for highly expressed GPCRs; the maximal
signal was equal to that elicited by ionomycin, a positive control.
PTGER1 did not elicit a signal, implying that one TPM may be a threshold
for the detection of Gq/11 signaling in these cells by this method. Figure 7b shows the concentration–response
for each agonist that increases the cytosolic calcium. The apparent
EC50 values for these ligands vary somewhat from values
in the literature, e.g., the EC50 for neurotensin signaling
at NTSR1 is ∼0.3 nM, approximately an order of magnitude lower
than that reported in the literature.14 This raises the possibility that signaling in native cells may differ
from that in model systems where such data are typically generated.
The kinetics for ionomycin and for agonists at concentrations approximately
corresponding to half-maximal response (Figure 7c) suggest differences in the rates of activation
of the different GPCRs, although the calcium transient is ∼60–90
s in all cases.

We next tested the ability of these agonists
(excluding sulprostone,
as we obtained no evidence of calcium response for this compound),
to stimulate migration (using a wound-healing assay) at concentrations
that correspond to maximal activation of their respective GPCRs. Figure 7d shows the effect
of agonist treatment on the rate of wound closure, compared with vehicle-treated
cells. We used cells plated without the serum as a negative control.
Higher GPCR expression and stronger calcium response result in greater
stimulation of migration (Figure 7e,f), thus allowing us to relate GPCR expression, signaling,
and functional response. Based on data in Figure 3i, Affymetrix data in the same cell line,
from the same source (CCLE) failed to resolve the differences in expression
between these GPCRs that were observed via RNA-seq. As a consequence,
the data from the Affymetrix arrays did not permit accurate identification
and stratification of GPCRs based on their expression and hence those
results could not reliably predict which GPCRs were highly enough
expressed to yield a strong functional response. Thus, data from Affymetrix
arrays do not reliably identify the GPCRs that are most highly expressed.
In screening for expression of GPCRs for subsequent drug/target discovery
studies, Affymetrix arrays should likely be avoided in favor of other
methods.

Discussion
The comparison of three
methods for high-content screening of GPCR
mRNA expression reveals that TaqMan GPCR arrays and RNA-seq show comparable
performance, whereas Affymetrix arrays perform at a lower level. A
likely reason for the latter result is the generally low expression
of GPCRs, such that they are outside the dynamic range for optimal
detection by arrays designed to assess the entire transcriptome. Highly
expressed GPCRs, especially ones that are well characterized, are
generally reliably detected by either TaqMan GPCR arrays or RNA-seq.
By contrast, Affymetrix arrays fail to identify large numbers of GPCRs
and show the poor correlation of expression and estimates for changes
in expression compared to the other two methods. GPCRs, as a large
family of genes, with a large (3 orders of magnitude) range of expression
provide additional support for the accuracy and completeness, especially
of RNA-seq data, and complement other validation studies.30 The numerous false negatives observed with Affymetrix
data are likely attributable to lower sensitivity, i.e., for expression
thresholds <4–5 TPM in corresponding RNA-seq data, GPCRs
will frequently be undetected by Affymetrix arrays.

The comparison
of the three methods (Table 1) shows that TaqMan arrays or RNA-seq are
preferable for GPCR detection and profiling. TaqMan arrays require
minimal bioinformatic effort and, thus, can rapidly generate data.
Important advantages of RNA-seq include: (1) the number of GPCRs that
are potentially detectable (Table S2),
since gene-specific primers or probes are not needed and (2) RNA-seq
detects non-GPCR genes (including data for post-GPCR signaling components),
yielding far more information than do TaqMan arrays. RNA-seq, thus,
has the potential to explore other aspects of GPCR biology, such as
pathways for cellular regulation.

these are subject to variation, depending on access to core facilities

As a consequence of the ongoing decrease in the cost of sequencing,
the potentially lower expense to conduct RNA-seq is another advantage
of this technique. A “hidden” cost of RNA-seq involves
data analysis and storage, which can substantially increase the expenditure
for RNA-seq. RNA-seq requires time for library preparation and sequencing
as well as bioinformatic analysis. By contrast, data analysis of qPCR-based
arrays can be done quickly. Other qPCR-based arrays are available
that may yield comparable data but at a lower cost than TaqMan arrays,
e.g., SYBR green-based arrays [e.g., Cat # 10034500 (Bio-Rad) and
Cat # PAHS-071Z (Qiagen)].

A further advantage of RNA-seq is
that it has become a method of
choice for many large databases and consortia (e.g., TCGA and GTEx31). The abundance of such publicly available RNA-seq
data facilitates data mining and yields information for new studies,
including with respect to GPCR signaling components and how GPCRs
and such components may have altered expression profiles during physiologic
perturbations and in disease states. Limited public data are available
for GPCR arrays so mining of such data is less feasible.

Affymetrix
array-derived data is found in sources such as Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and other databases and for many years has
been used for data mining. The findings here suggest that for GPCRs,
mining of Affymetrix array data is not advisable. Moreover, to the
extent that GPCRs may be differentially expressed in cells or tissues,
such as in disease,3 the large number of
false-negative results from Affymetrix arrays may impact on other
analyses, such as in pathways and networks, in which GPCRs may be
involved. The inferior dynamic range of Affymetrix arrays is likely
not limited to GPCRs and may impact on the detection of other low-expressed,
but functionally important, genes. Thus, caution is advised in the
use of Affymetrix arrays and mining of Affymetrix array data. Moreover,
the evidence cited above for OV and LUSC tumors supports our conclusion
that Affymetrix arrays yield numerous false negatives, i.e., GPCR
mRNAs that are not detected but that are functionally relevant.

The study of the “GPCRome” and individual GPCRs identified
by the methods compared here has the potential to yield important
insights regarding the regulation of cells and tissues in health and
disease. Moreover, GPCRs are targeted by ∼35% of FDA- and EMA-approved
drugs1 and represent the largest family
of drug targets. Given their high druggability, identification of
GPCRs in novel contexts can aid in drug discovery efforts.32 The current results and other data show that
cells express large numbers of (>100) GPCRs; these include GPCRs
targeted
by approved drugs, orphan receptors, and many GPCRs for which tool
compounds (but not approved drugs) may exist. Multiple studies of
“GPCRomics” combined with signaling and functional analyses
have revealed novel roles for GPCRs in numerous cell types.3,8,32−37 A growing number of studies have also begun to reveal the extent
to which the presence of splice variants among GPCRs may impact their
functional activity.28,29 Consequences of such alternative
splicing include the presence of receptor isoforms with altered ligand
binding (primarily due to changes in the N-terminus), altered downstream
signaling (including “decoy” receptors that bind ligands
but have no functional activity), and potential effects on receptor
trafficking, internalization, and localization within specific cellular
domains. This remains a largely understudied aspect of GPCR biology.
The presence of numerous GPCR splice variants at the mRNA level underscores
the need for further investigation.

Because mRNA expression
may not necessarily predict protein expression,
we undertook functional studies of Gq-coupled GPCRs to test the concordance
of mRNA expression with signaling/functional data. In general, for
GPCRs, direct measurement of protein expression has been challenging,
due to (a) difficulty in obtaining well-validated antibodies and (b)
the low magnitude of expression of GPCRs. Thus, indirect methods to
verify protein expression are needed. Here, we show that GPCR mRNA
expression predicts signaling and functional response for multiple
Gq/11-coupled GPCRs in a pancreatic cancer cell line. Highly expressed
GPCRs (e.g., NTSR1 and P2RY2), which are among the 10 most highly
expressed GPCRs overall in these cells, show very strong agonist-induced
increases in intracellular calcium response and prominent functional
response (migration), both of which appear to saturate at high levels
of GPCR expression. We are not aware of prior such data for Gq/G11-coupled
GPCRs, in particular in native cells.

Other results that imply
a concordance between mRNA expression
and functional response of prostanoid receptors in fibroblasts37 and adrenoceptors in induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived cardiomyocytes8 support this
observation in other GPCR systems. Thus, encouraging initial data
(including those shown here) suggest that GPCR expression data can
provide a useful first step in drug/target discovery efforts, with
highly expressed GPCRs (or differentially expressed GPCRs in disease)
likely to be the favored candidates for subsequent validation. Further
studies are needed to determine the extent to which GPCR expression
predicts the intensity of downstream signaling events, such as protein
phosphorylation, transcriptional regulation, etc. Affymetrix arrays
are not recommended for such efforts, as they do not adequately distinguish
between high-expressed and low-expressed GPCRs and, in addition, fail
to detect many GPCRs.

The analysis of the dynamic range of the
detection of Affymetrix
arrays (Figure 6) shows
that the failure of these arrays to distinguish between expression
of GPCRs was not explainable by “saturation” of these
arrays, i.e., requiring dilution of samples to better place them on
a standard curve for detection. The Affymetrix arrays were able to
resolve large differences in expression between highly expressed genes
(e.g., GAPDH) and lower expressed genes (e.g., many GPCRs) over a
dynamic range (∼3 orders of magnitude) consistent with previous
observations.38 This result implies that
the failure to adequately resolve differences in GPCR expression is
likely attributable to (a) the flawed probe design for specific GPCR
genes and (b) the lack of sensitivity of Affymetrix arrays to resolve
small differences in expression between genes, especially lower expressed
genes, to the level of quantitative precision obtainable by RNA-seq.

Omics data such as those presented in this study reveal the high
expression of numerous orphan GPCRs in human disease, for which such
validation studies are more challenging. Given the apparent concordance
between the magnitude of expression and functional response of GPCRs,
such data highlight specific highly expressed orphan GPCRs as priority
candidates for further study and for attempts at deorphanization.

The data presented here highlight aspects of GPCR biology that
merit further study. These include: (a) what is the functional impact
of alternative splicing of GPCRs? (b) the high expression of many
orphan GPCRs underscores the importance for further deorphanization
efforts; the physiological role of much of the GPCRome remains unknown;
(c) given the abundance of GPCRs expressed in different cell types,
do GPCRs that are more widely/ubiquitously expressed than others have
a functional significance? (d) which mechanisms regulate the expression
of individual or groups of GPCRs in particular cell types? We anticipate
that GPCRomic efforts, in combination with other techniques, will
help address such issues, advance understanding of GPCR biology, and
aid in efforts to develop novel therapeutics.
