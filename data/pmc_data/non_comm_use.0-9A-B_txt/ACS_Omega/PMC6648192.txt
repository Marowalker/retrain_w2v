Engineered nanomaterials are emerging
in the field of environmental
chemistry. This study involves the analysis of the structural, electronic,
crystallinity, and morphological changes in graphitic carbon nitride
(g-C3N4), an engineered nanomaterial, under
rapid cooling conditions. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
Fourier transform infrared, Raman, band gap, and Mott–Schottky
analyses strongly proved that the liquid N2-quenched sample
of g-C3N4 has structural distortion. The photocatalytic
efficiency of engineered g-C3N4 nanostructures
was analyzed through the degradation of reactive red 120 (RR120),
methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B, and bromophenol as a representative
dye. The photocatalytic dye degradation efficiency was analyzed by
UV–vis spectroscopy and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis.
The photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 under
different quenching conditions included quenching at room temperature
in ice and liquid N2. The degradation efficiencies are
found to be 4.2, 14.7, and 82.33% for room-temperature, ice, and liquid
N2 conditions, respectively. The pseudo-first-order reaction
rate of N2-quenched g-C3N4 is 9 times
greater than the ice-quenched g-C3N4. Further,
the TOC analysis showed that 55% (MB) and 59% (RR120) of photocatalytic
mineralization were achieved within a time duration of 120 min by
the liquid N2-quenched g-C3N4 nanostructure.
In addition, the quenched g-C3N4 electrocatalytic
behavior was examined via the hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction
in acidic medium. The liquid N2-quenched g-C3N4 catalyst showed a lower overpotential with high H2 evolution when compared with the other two g-C3N4-quenched samples. The results obtained provide an insight
and extend the scope for the application of engineered g-C3N4 nanostructures in the degradation of organic pollutants
as well as for H2 evolution.

1 Introduction
Rapid
industrial development and demand for cheap energy leads
to various environmental hazards as it affects the living organism
because of their cryogenic effect.1−4 Fossil fuels are the main resources and
play a crucial role to supply world energy demand; however, they will
produce environmental problems mainly in water bodies.5−7 Material research studies have devoted their efforts to tackle the
problems of these hazardous materials.8,9 In materials
science, the discovery of graphene ushered in the study of two-dimensional
(2D) materials10,11 because these materials offer
high surface to volume ratio, high carrier mobility, and enhanced
light absorption.12,13 Unique properties of low-dimensional
materials are attracting, which trigged the development and discovery
of other low-dimensional materials such as graphene oxide, graphdiyne,
graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), metal chalcogenide,
and Mxene.14−17 Among the 2D materials, g-C3N4 is a metal-free
polymer semiconductor, which is constituted of carbon and nitrogen.18,19 g-C3N4 has varied photocatalytic properties
in the visible region and received tremendous interest among the researchers.20,21 Previous studies have focused on the synthesis of highly efficient
photocatalysts through the modification of electronic structures and
morphology engineering.22 Attempts have
been made to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 by making hybrids.23,24 These compounds
and their hybrids have potential industrial applications such as H2 production, CO2 reduction, supercapacitor and
sensor fabrication, and organic pollutant degradation.25−30

The photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4 predominantly
suffered from poor surface area, low electrical conductivity, and
rapid charge carrier recombination. These advantages can be overcome
by turning its nanostructure.31,32 For instance, engineered
TiO2 displays superior photocatalytic activity, compared
to its conventional form because of the minimization of charge carrier.33,34 The studies on TiO2 reveal that changes made in morphology
and electronic structure enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. Earlier
studies have used various methods to tune the nanostructure of g-C3N4, such as alkaline modification, acid treatment,
metal doping (N, P, F), treatment of inorganic semiconductors/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, and formation of carbon/g-C3N4 hybrids.35−39 Similarly, various approaches have been applied for the creation
of other nanostructures. Doping and the hybrid formation method have
some serious drawbacks such as dopant loss and the use of strong
acid. In addition, in self-doped TiO2, the obtained efficiency
is not enough to degrade the hazardous pollutant.40 Therefore, we need to explore new methodologies to improve
the photocatalytic efficiency of the g-C3N4 nanostructure.

In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate the enhancement
of photocatalytic properties of engineered g-C3N4 using simple quenching techniques with various quenchers. The methodology
involves the synthesis of g-C3N4 using pyrolysis
at 450 °C, followed by quenching under varied conditions such
as room temperature and ice and liquid nitrogen cooling. The photocatalytic
degradation properties of the obtained catalyst were analyzed, using
the degradation of organic dyes such as reactive red 120 (RR120),
methylene blue (MB), bromophenol B (BP), and rhodamine B (RhB). Dye
discoloration and its degradation were analyzed by the UV–vis
spectroscopy and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis measurements.

2 Experiments
2.1 Materials
For
g-C3N4 preparation, urea was chosen as a raw
material, which was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Organic pollutants including
anionic, cationic, and phenol compounds, namely, reactive red 120,
MB, RhB, and BP, were procured from Alfa Aesar, India. The radical
scavenger benzoquinone, ethanol, and electrolyte were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, India. All reactions were carried out with distilled
water.

2.2 g-C3N4 Preparation Methods
The preparation of engineered g-C3N4 involves
simple pyrolysis. In this study, 2 g of urea was ground and placed
into a furnace heated to 450 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min
for a time duration of 2 h. During pyrolysis, the crucible was sealed
to avoid the compound loss. After pyrolysis, the crucible was cooled
to room temperature by various quenching processes such as room-temperature
quenching, ice quenching, and liquid nitrogen quenching. In the quenching
process, the direct contact of the quencher and g-C3N4 was avoided. The room-temperature and ice- and liquid nitrogen-quenched
samples were labeled as G1, G2, and G3, respectively.

2.3 Physical Characterization
The physical
properties such as crystalline morphologies, surface areas, band gaps,
structural defects, and presence of functional groups were studied
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–DRS),
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. The instruments
employed for the analysis were XRD (XRD Lab, X-Shimadzu), SEM (JEOL,
JSE-6390 SEM), high-resolution SEM (JEOL JEM 2100 HR-TEM), the BET
surface area (JASCO V-660), FTIR spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific Nicolet
6700 FTIR), UV–vis (JASCO, V-40), DRS UV (Model: Shimadzu model),
and Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA LabRam HR Evolution). Mott–Schottky
analysis was carried out using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.

2.4 Photocatalyst Study
The photocatalytic
properties of the engineered g-C3N4 for the
degradation of RR120, MB, RhB, and BP were studied under visible light
(150 W Xe lamp, >420 nm) in the home-made reactor. Initially, 1
×
10–5 M probe molecule and 5 mg of the catalyst were
thoroughly mixed using a magnetic stirrer. The pollutant and engineered
g-C3N4 catalyst were stirred for 30 min to reach
the adsorption equilibrium. At periodic time intervals, 3 mL of the
probe solution was taken out to measure the absorption. The photocatalytic
degradation of RR120, MB, and RhB was calibrated at 520, 664, and
550 nm absorbance maxima, respectively. The initial and time-dependent
dye concentration are denoted as C0 and
Ct, where t refers to
the reaction time and “k’” to
the pseudo-first-order rate constant. The expression used for calculating
the dye efficiency is given below.41 1

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Physical
Characterization
The crystalline
and structural changes of the G1, G2, and G3 samples were studied
using XRD and are shown in Figure 1a. In the figure, G1 has a d-spacing
of 0.319 nm, which is consistent with the values of the previously
reported g-C3N4 nanostructures.42,43 The d-spacing for G2 and G3 was about
0.32 nm, which is slightly higher than the naturally cooled g-C3N4. Furthermore, the diffraction angle was shifted
to a lower angle region from 27.9°, 27.6°, and 27.1°
for samples G1, G2, and G3, respectively. The peak shift maybe associated
with the lattice dislocation or a defect, which may be induced during
the quenching. Further, the grain sizes of G1, G2, and G3 were found
to be 3.1, 7.15, and 11.75 nm, respectively. Generally, g-C3N4 showed two distinguishable XRD peaks, which can be
assigned to the (001) and (002) crystal lattice.44 However, the disappearance of the structural peak (001)
observed in G2 and G3 at a lower angle confirms the structural alteration
in the quenched samples.45 The XRD analysis
proves the introduction of defects in the samples G2 and G3. SEM analysis
was carried out to examine the morphology at the nanoscopic level.
All the engineered g-C3N4 (G1, G2, and G3) samples
exhibited a flakelike structure with different sizes. To better understand
the morphology of g-C3N4, HR-TEM analysis was
carried out. Figure 2 shows the HR-TEM images of the various quenched g-C3N4 samples. Figure 2a–d represents the HR-TEM images of G1 where the smooth
and uniform sheetlike structure can be seen at lower and higher magnification.
In the case of G2, similar sheetlike structures are clearly seen with
perfect edges (Figure 2e–h). On the other hand, the HR-TEM images of G3 represented
in Figure 2i–l
show a sheetlike structure with several pores uniformly distributed
on the surface. In the high magnification, the image depicts that
the pores are in the size of a few nanometers. The creation of pores
on the 2D structure is due to the quenching process. Such types of
pores on the surface have been previously reported on graphene sheets
because of KOH activation and metal doping.46,47 Morphology changes in G3 samples can be explained using the principles
of thermodynamics. The temperature of liquid N2 is −196
°C, which is much lower than the room temperature and the temperature
of ice. Once a hot g-C3N4 is surrounded by liquid
N2, it will cause rapid cooling. This uneven thermal profile
along the g-C3N4 surface cools faster than ice
and room-temperature conditions. This ultrafast cooling induces the
pores on the surface, leading to a different morphology as observed
in G3. To further understand the surface area and pore nature of the
g-C3N4-quenched samples, the BET surface area
measurement was carried out. Figure 3 depicts the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of the quenched g-C3N4 samples. All
the g-C3N4 samples exhibit type IV adsorption–desorption
isotherm (Figure 3a–c),
which revealed that mesoporous structures could be present in g-C3N4.48Figure 3d–f represents the pore
size distribution curve of G1, G2, and G3, respectively. The obtained
average pore diameters were 5.4, 5.2, and 5.2 nm for samples G1, G2,
and G3, respectively. Naturally quenched g-C3N4 has a low surface area of 12.67 m2/g and a low pore volume
of 0.017 cm3/g. For G2, the surface area was 99.96 m2/g and the pore volume was 0.13 cm3/g. The G3 sample
has the highest surface area of 807.12 m2/g and the largest
pore volume of 1.06 cm3/g. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra of G1, G2, and G3 samples were measured to understand
the chemical composition. Figure 4a represents the full survey spectra of G1, G2, and
G3, in which two prominent peaks were observed at 286.9 and 397.8
eV corresponding to C 1s and N 1s, respectively. The high-resolution
C 1s spectra consist of two peaks including 283.6 and 287.2 eV, which
are shown in Figure 4b.49,50 Further, the peak binding energy was slightly
changed for the samples G2 and G3. Likewise, the N 1s spectra peak
position and peak integral area were changed in G2 and G3 samples,
respectively. The deconvoluted N 1s spectra are shown in Figure 4d–f. All spectra
consist of three peaks located at 397.6, 398.3, and 399.8 eV assigned
to C–N–C, N–(C)3, and N–H bonds, respectively.51 It is important to note that we calculated the
peak area ratio between two coordinated N2C atoms and three
coordinated N3C atoms. The peak ratio (N2C/N3C) was decreased in G3 when compared with that in G1 and G2,
and also the binding energy was shifted. This observation indicates
that actual N atoms are vacant in quenched g-C3N4. On the other hand, the N vacancy is mainly ascribed to the N2C lattice site because of the unsaturated coordination and
also higher population. These results were well consistent with previously
reported results.52 The overall XPS spectra
emphasize that the quenched g-C3N4 has structural
defects compared with pure g-C3N4.

Figure 5a
represents
the UV–DRS spectra of engineered g-C3N4 samples, and the variation in band gap across the samples is observed.
From the figure, no obvious regular change can be found, that is,
the band gap has decreased for G2 and then increased for G3 when compared
to that of G1, which is mainly due to the change of the electronic
structure in the quenched samples.53 The
FTIR spectra of G1, G2, and G3 samples were also studied and are shown
in Figure 5b. The observed
vibration band of the engineered samples (N–H: 3186, C=N:
1634, and C–N: 1326 cm–1) agrees with the
functional groups of g-C3N4. The absorption
band at 810 cm–1 can be assigned to the tri-s-triazine-based structure.54,55 Besides, C=N
and C–N appeared at 1260–1480 and 1572–1633 cm–1, respectively. These C=N and C–N bands
have a slight difference in the G3 sample. On the other hand, the
band intensity also decreased, which confirms the defect developed
in G3. Raman spectroscopy is an important tool to analyze the 2D material
structures. Raman spectra of pure and N2-quenched g-C3N4 are shown in Figure 5c. It is observed that G1 and G3 samples
exhibit different Raman patterns, which suggests that the g-C3N4 crystallinity was affected in the N2-quenching process. Broad peaks were observed at 1200–1700
cm–1, which are due to the C–N asymmetric
structural vibrations. This peak is similar to the G and D peaks observed
for the carbon-based material. Apart from the broad peaks, a few sharp
peaks were observed at a lower angle, which is due to the different
types of s-triazine.56 Further, the structural disorder developed in g-C3N4 can be effectively analyzed by the intensity ratio between
the D and G bands (ID/IG). The calculated relative ID/IG intensities were 0.86 and 1.01 for
G1 and G3, respectively. The change in relative intensity suggested
that the N2-cooled g-C3N4 has crystal
distraction in its structure.57

(b) FTIR spectroscopy, and (c) Raman spectra
of G1, G2, and G3.

To investigate the band
potential analysis of G1, G2, and G3, Mott–Schottky
analysis was carried out. The Mott–Schottky measurement was
conducted in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at
pH 7 under dark condition. The flat band potentials of prepared samples
were determined using the Mott–Schottky expression at 298 K.
The estimated flat band potential was found from the average value
of the x-intercepts of the linear portion of the
Mott–Schottky plot. The measured potentials versus Ag/AgCl
were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via
the Nernst equation 3  Here, VRHE is
the converted potential versus RHE, VAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference
electrode, and the value of VAg/AgClvsNHE0 is 0.209 V at 25 °C. Figure 6a represents the
flat band potential of the engineered g-C3N4 samples. The observed flat band potentials of G1, G2, and G3 are
−0.628, −0.778, and −0.998 eV, respectively.
Using the Mott–Schottky analysis, the band potential of the
various engineered g-C3N4 was examined.58Figure 6b depicts the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) position
of the engineered g-C3N4 sample. The observed
upshift in CB position in G1, G2, and G3 indicates the reduction capability
of the photoexcited electron, whose activity can be enhanced under
visible light. The overall physical characterization mentioned above
indicates that the liquid N2-quenched samples have defects
and a disordered structure. This structurally modified g-C3N4 sample shows an increase in photocatalytic efficiency
that was studied using various pollutants.

and G3.

3.2 Photocatalytic
Activity and Analysis
The photocatalytic degradation efficiencies
of engineered G1, G2,
and G3 samples are monitored by the dye degradation method. Figure 7a–c shows
the UV absorbance spectra of RR120 measured at different time intervals
of the photocatalytic reaction for the samples G1, G2, and G3, respectively.
The corresponding residual concentration against the time plot is
shown in Figure 7d.
The dye degradation efficiency was calculated using the empirical eq 2. After 120 min of irradiation,
the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was found to be 28, 49,
and 82% for G1, G2, and G3, respectively. Obviously, the efficiency
of G3 is much higher than that of G1 and G2. To gain understanding
regarding the difference in the reaction rate between the catalysts,
the rate constant analysis was performed using expression 1. The calculated quasi-first-order reaction rate
constant of G3 was nearly 9-fold greater than G2. This experimental
observation convincingly proved that the sample G3 as a photocatalyst
outperformed samples G1 and G2. In addition to validate the photocatalytic
efficiency of G3, it was tested against other dye molecules. Figure 8a–c shows
the photocatalytic degradation of MB, RhB, and BP in the presence
of G3. The photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of MB, RhB, and
BP are 95, 76, and 92%, respectively. From this observation, it can
be said that the sample G3 acts as a good photocatalyst for degrading
anionic–cationic dyes and phenol derivatives.59 In order to understand the photocatalytic mechanism of
G3, radical scavenging analysis was performed.60Figure 9a depicts the C/C0 against
the time plot of G3 samples after the addition of EtOH and benzoquinone
radicals as a scavenger. From the figure, it is clear that benzoquinone
is more effective than alpha hydrogen alcohol in inhibiting the reaction.
On the basis of the findings, it can be deduced that the superoxide
radical plays a dynamic role in the photocatalytic degradation of
the organic pollutants.61 On the other
hand, EtOH also suppressed the photocatalytic reaction; however, the
effect was less. From this study, it can be concluded that superoxide
and hydroxyl radicals play an important role in the degradation process.
The enhanced degradation can be explained by the electronic structure
of g-C3N4.

= 120 min).

by G3 (RR120 = 1 × 10–5 M, g-C3N4 = 5 mg L–1, and reaction time = 120 min).

As seen in Figure 6b, the CB potentials are −0.628, −0.728,
and −0.998
eV for G1, G2, and G3, respectively, and the CB potential of NHE is
1.58 eV. The CB potential is more negative than O2/O2• (−0.33
eV vs NHE) standard redox potential. Also, the band gap change in
the G3 sample is the reason for the concentration of more electrons
in the CB. These electrons play a critical role in the formation of
the superoxide radical. When g-C3N4 is irradiated
by light, the charge carriers are formed at the VB and CB edges. The
charge carriers migrate at the surface and react with oxygen and OH
to produce a free radical. Further, these radicals oxidize and reduce
the target molecule which is adsorbed on the surface.62 It is widely accepted that the large surface area and pores
on the surface serve as a good adsorption site for organic pollutants.
From BET results, it is observed that the G3 sample has a large surface
area as well as a high porosity.63,64 Plenty of
molecules are adsorbed by G3, resulting in high degradation efficiency.
Further, we have performed the catalytic durability test for the sample
G3. As seen in Figure 9b, there was no degradation efficiency loss observed even after the
fourth cycle. These results suggest that the catalyst has high stability.65 In addition, TOC analysis was carried out to
understand the organic carbon removal efficiency of the photocatalyst
from the dye.66Figure 9c,d shows the time-dependent TOC amount for
RR120 and MB dyes during photocatalysis. From the figure, it is observed
that during the photocatalysis of RR120 and MB, a mineralization of
55 and 59% is achieved, respectively. The TOC results clearly indicate
that the catalyst strongly mineralizes the organic dye (RR120 and
MB) during photocatalysis. The overall results highlight that the
rapid cooling process is one of the cost-effective ways to modify
the morphology and the electronic structure of the catalyst, leading
to the enhancement of the photocatalytic properties.

3.3 Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution
Electrochemical
water splitting is a promising pathway to produce
renewable and green H2. The presently available electrocatalytic
material such as Pt is costly and strongly hinders the scalable application.67 In this work, the HER activity of G1, G2, and
G3 was studied in 0.5 M H2SO4. The polarization
curve is shown in Figure 10, and the sample G3 provides enhanced hydrogen production
with a lower onset potential of −0.350 mV. On the other hand,
G1 and G2 showed the onset potentials of −0.469 and −0.469
mV, respectively. The polarization curves of the current density for
the corresponding materials are found to be −48.5, −75.7,
and −305.02 μA/cm2 for G1, G2, and G3, respectively.
In addition, we also measured the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) of the prepared g-C3N4 sample. Figure 10b depicts the Nyquist
plot of the EIS for G1, G2, and G3. The sample G3 showed lower charge
resistance compared to the other samples, and hence, G3 shows higher
hydrogen production.

4 Conclusions
The photocatalytic properties
of the engineered g-C3N4 prepared by quenching
at different temperatures are
better than the samples prepared by pyrolysis alone. The unique morphology
of quenched g-C3N4 enhances absorbance, band
gap, and flat band potential and reduces the particle size. The pseudo-first-order
reaction rate of the nitrogen-quenched g-C3N4 is 9 times greater than the ice-quenched g-C3N4. Superoxide radicals play a significant role in the dye degradation,
which was justified by the scavenger studies. The enhanced degradation
of RR120 and MB is due to the increase of band potential of the CB.
This increase may be due to the migration of the photoinduced electron.
The results obtained in this study provide insights into the application
of g-C3N4 as an effective catalyst for the degradation
of organic pollutants. There is scope for further research in the
understanding and consolidation of the catalytic properties of g-C3N4.
