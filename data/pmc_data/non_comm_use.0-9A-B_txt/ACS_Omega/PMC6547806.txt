The family of Angiomotin (Amot) proteins
regulate several biological pathways associated with cellular differentiation,
proliferation, and migration. These adaptor proteins target proteins
to the apical membrane, actin fibers, or the nucleus. A major function
of the Amot coiled-coil homology (ACCH) domain is to initiate protein
interactions with the cellular membrane, particularly those containing
phosphatidylinositol lipids. The work presented in this article uses
several ACCH domain lysine/arginine mutants to probe the relative
importance of individual residues for lipid binding. This identified
four lysine and three arginine residues that mediate full lipid binding.
Based on these findings, three of these residues were mutated to glutamates
in the Angiomotin 80 kDa splice form and were incorporated into human
mammary cell lines. Results show that mutating three of these residues
in the context of full-length Angiomotin reduced the residence of
the protein at the apical membrane. These findings provide new insight
into how the ACCH domain mediates lipid binding to enable Amot proteins
to control epithelial cell growth.

Introduction
The family of Angiomotin (Amot)
proteins regulate
several biological pathways associated with cellular differentiation,
proliferation, and migration. The Amot adaptor protein integrates
the control of cellular morphology with its proclivity to proliferate.1−3 This is mainly accomplished through
the differential ability of specific isoforms of Amot to orient the
trafficking of proteins that regulate apical cell polarity with proteins
involved in the HIPPO growth control pathway.1,4 Amot
localization is determined by membrane association, an essential and
conserved feature controlled by its lipid affinity comprised of the
novel Amot coiled-coil homology (ACCH) domain.5 This domain, while sharing some features of BAR domains, specifically
predicts a coiled-coil fold of approximately 240 residues. This differs
from classical BAR domains in that it has the unique property of being
able to selectively bind phosphatidylinositols (PIs) and cholesterol.5 However, the mechanism by which the ACCH domain
screens for these lipids is currently unknown.

To address this
gap in knowledge, we investigated the mechanisms used by three classic
domains that target PIs. The FYVE domain contains a positively charged
pocket that has selective affinity for monophosphorylated PI based
on exclusion criteria predicated on the size of the headgroup.6,7 The plekstrin homology (PH) domain contains a basic pocket with
a loop rich in lysines, arginines, and hydrophobic amino acids that
provides a size specificity towards di- and triphosphorylated PIs.6,8 Finally, the Phox consensus sequence (PX) motif specifically binds
monophosphorylated PI3P via a basic binding pocket.6 Similar to these domains, the ACCH domain is also rich
in lysines and arginines. Therefore, we hypothesized that the enrichment
of these positively charged residues in the ACCH domain is essential
for targeting Amot to PI-containing membranes.

This report details
the determination of specific arginine and lysine residues within
the ACCH domain that mediate the overall affinity for PI. To that
end, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to probe the specific
contributions of each lysine and arginine residue by changing them
to nonpositively charged amino acids and evaluating the resulting
ability to associate to specific PI-containing membranes by lipid
sedimentation and native tyrosine fluorescence quenching. From those
screens, eight lysines and arginine residues were selected and characterized
for changes in binding affinity. Finally, in vitro experiments confirmed
that three of these residues, whose mutation in the context of Amot80
led to a change in its cellular localization, are required for full
membrane binding.

Results
Fluorescence Quenching
The binding affinity
of the ACCH domain for specific lipid compositions was measured by
the degree of tyrosine residue fluorescence quenching as a function
of the concentration of various dansylated liposomes. In general,
increasing the amount of PI-containing lipid resulted in a decrease
in tyrosine fluorescence. This indicates that the liposomes were coming
into close proximity to and quenched the fluorescence of the ACCH
domain tyrosines (Figure 1). Furthermore, the AmotL1 and AmotL2 ACCH domains bound liposomes
with a similar affinity as Amot80, with around 50% of the protein
bound at 8.32 mM POPC/POPE/PI (3/1/1) liposomes, whereas no significant
binding for any ACCH domain was seen for POPC liposomes. Similar to
results previously reported using surface plasmon resonance,5 a 10-fold higher affinity of the ACCH domain
for liposomes containing 20 mol % cholesterol was observed. Fluorescence
quenching data also indicated a first-order correlation between total
lipid concentration and protein bound. Hence, all screening assays
for detecting decreasing lipid affinity were carried out at a saturating
concentration of 20 mM lipid.

Mutant
Library Screen
Based on the hypothesis that positively charged
residues in the ACCH domain mediate binding to PIs similar to BAR,
PH, and PX, and FYVE domains, we used the WebLogo tool to determine
the charge conservation of the residues between the ACCH domains of
Amot80, AmotL1, and AmotL2, with a particular interest in the positively
charged arginines and lysines. The resulting alignments guided our
choice of residues to query further by site-directed mutagenesis (Figure 3). A basic charge
or an exposed amine group based on pH was conserved for all lysine
and arginine residues except Lys126, Arg153, and Lys185.

Lys126
corresponds to an alanine and aspartate in AmotL1 and AmotL2, respectively.
A BLAST search among all known and predicted AmotL1 across species
shows that this alanine is completely conserved, as is the aspartate
in AmotL2. We therefore mutated this residue to a glutamate to give
Amot a similar charge–charge interaction as AmotL2.

Lys185
is conserved in AmotL2 but is a glutamate in AmotL1. In this study,
we mutated Lys185 to the same interactions of AmotL1 while maintaining
a similar space of the other two family members.

Arg153 is conserved
as an arginine in AmotL1, but using the Weblogo alignment, we found
that this residue is a highly conserved, hydrophobic, slightly smaller
leucine next to the arginine in AmotL2. Therefore, mutating Arg153
into a glutamate in this study reversed the charge while occupying
the same space as all of the Amot family members. A glycine mutant
was also constructed for our screening studies, which is a much smaller,
noncharged residue than either residue seen naturally.

The lack
of a significant difference in the AC50 values between family members
suggests that a similar membrane association would be observed when
Lys126 and Lys185, and not Arg153, were mutated to encode a negatively
charged residue.

Charge conservation was further observed for
lysine residues at positions 49, 52, 55, 62, 72, 82, 85, 87, 94, 103,
105, 111, 142, 144, 166, 179, 193, 196, 210, 217, 219, and 234. Such
conservation suggests that these residues participate in membrane
association. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out at the majority
of these residues to encode a glutamate to reverse the charge while
retaining a similar occupying space as the original acidic residue.
Additional mutations that encode a serine or threonine result in an
exposed negatively charged nucleophile at the original positively
charged amine group. When neither of these mutation classes proved
possible, the residue was mutated to a glycine. All of these mutations
are described in Figure 3. Based on our hypothesis, we expected to see the most significant
reduction in membrane association for mutations where the residue
charge was the most conserved.

To screen mutants for decreased
lipid binding, we first used the fluorescence quenching assay. In
this assay, each mutant was screened for tyrosine fluorescence before
and after lipid binding at a singular lipid concentration and compared
to the results obtained with the wild-type protein. Relative fluorescence
after lipid association was calculated using eq 1, and the percent change in fluorescence with
respect to the wild-type protein was calculated for each mutation
(Figure 3). Of the
residues tested, Arg52, Lys82, Arg85, Lys87, Arg105, Arg153, Arg166,
Lys179, Lys187, Lys193, Arg219, and Arg234 resulted in greater than
40% reduction in lipid binding.

Differences in lipid binding
for each mutant was validated by measuring their sedimentation with
liposomes (Figure 2). While sedimentation assays are generally more of a qualitative
tool for measuring relative affinity, the advantage of this assay
is its independence from the requirement that the protein be in close
proximity to the dansylated lipid headgroup that could be sequestered
to PI-driven phase separations, which is then later reorganized by
the ACCH domain.9 Therefore, we did an
initial screen of the change in the ratio of protein bound/unbound
relative to the wild-type protein and reported it as percent change
(Figure 3). In these experiments, mutations at residues Arg24,
Lys49, Arg52, Lys82, Arg85, Lys87, Arg103, Arg153, Arg166, Lys179,
Lys193, Lys210, and Arg219 resulted in a 40% or greater reduction
in lipid binding relative to the wild-type protein.

ACCH domain studied in our library shows the residue and charge conservation
with the AmotL1 and AmotL2 ACCH domain sequences. Lipid binding to
each mutant was initially screened by the sedimentation and fluorescence
quenching assay where mutations are shaded based on changes in binding:
≥40% increase (red box), ≥20% increase (pink box), ≥20%
reduction (gray box), and ≥40% reduction (black box).

While mutations
in nonconserved residues including Arg24, Lys116, Lys126, Lys134,
Lys136, Lys185, and Arg224 have little to no effect on lipid binding,
the Arg153 mutant had a significant decrease in association to membranes,
whereas mutations in eight conserved positively charged residues resulted
in a significant loss of membrane binding.

In summary, mutations
in nine residues (Arg52, Lys82, Arg85, Lys87, Arg153, Arg166, Lys179,
Lys193, and Arg219) resulted in at least a two-fold decrease in binding
by both screens (Figure 3). All of these mutants also showed reduced binding by triplicate
measurements of fluorescence quenching (Figure 4). Each of these mutations were further characterized
by their effect on nonrelated functions, such as ability to oligomerize,
and the lipid binding AC50.

Figure 4 Verification
of mutations from an initial screen. Mutations that initially showed
at least a 40% reduction in association (Figure 3) were verified in triplicate using the fluorescence
quenching assay. All mutations led to approximately a 2-fold reduction
in membrane-associated protein.

Mutation
Effect on Native Protein Function
The ACCH domains of Amot
family members also oligomerize, a key function that is implicated
in their roles in cells.10−13 This study was designed to exclude
mutations that had significant affects beyond membrane association,
such as a loss of globular structural features. Each mutant was therefore
also characterized for differences in oligomerization using size exclusion
chromatography. Only the Arg85 mutant showed a loss of higher-order
molecular weights (Figure 5). All other mutants therefore appear to form homo-oligomers
in a similar fashion as the wild-type domain. As a result, R85T was
excluded from further analysis.

mutant (blue line) shows a peak that corresponds to the monomer and
unappreciable amounts of oligomers.

Characterization of Mutant-Lipid Binding Affinity
The fluorescence quenching assay was employed to measure the lipid
binding AC50 for each of the resulting mutants to identify residues
that participate in lipid binding (Table 2). Mutation of a residue that participates
in lipid binding should lead to an increase in the AC50 for the fluorescence
quenching. Here, we found that mutating Lys82 and Arg219 did not have
a significant effect on lipid binding. Mutating Arg153 and Lys193
led to only moderate increases in AC50 values. In contrast, mutating
Arg52, Lys87, and Lys179 caused at least a two-fold increase in the
AC50 value.

The protein lipid overlay (PLO) assay was then employed
to further study the effect of these mutations on the lipid binding
affinity (Table 3).
Unlike the fluorescence quenching assay that utilizes multilayer lamellar
vesicles with fluorescently labeled lipid headgroups incorporated
throughout the entire mixture, the PLO assay requires the lipid to
be adsorbed on the surface of a nitrocellulose membrane providing
a single layer for protein interaction. As the nitrocellulose is a
stationary phase for presentation of the lipid, the protein is only
able to associate with the presented lipid and cannot perform the
lipid phase reorganization or membrane fusion activities of the domain
that is seen in the other experimental assays used in this study.
Furthermore, we utilized the POPC/POPE/PI/Chol (2/1/1/1 molar ratio)
lipid mixture that was previously reported to have a four-fold higher
affinity for the ACCH domain using surface plasmon resonance versus
the POPC/POPE/PI (3/1/1 molar ratio) liposomes used in the fluorescence
quenching assay.5 Both of these effects
led to an ∼1000× lower reported AC50 value for the PLO
assay than previously described (Figure 1A and Tables 1 and 3). Figure 6 shows a representative blot from this experiment.
In this assay, we found that mutating Lys87 and Arg219 had no significant
effect on their binding affinity for POPC/POPE/soy PI/Chol (2/1/1/1
molar ratio)-containing liposomes. This confirms results seen in the
fluorescence quenching experiment. However, mutating Arg52, Lys82,
Arg153, Lys179, and Lys193 led to drastic decreases in association
with the lipid spots. The difference in fold change between this assay
and the fluorescence quenching assay suggests that these mutations
do not have an effect on the protein reorganization or fusiginic activity
that is an inherent characteristic of the domain5 but the mutation only decreases the protein association
activity. The combination of the kinetic analyses indicated that Arg52,
Arg153, Lys179, and Lys193 might play a significant role in the mechanism
that mediates Amot association with membranes.

Amot80 Cellular Localization
To further confirm the
role of these residues on membrane affinity, the residues were then
mutated in full-length Amot80 for the determination of their effect
on cellular localization. As previously reported, wild-type Amot80
localizes at the plasma membrane and at cell-to-cell contacts.1,3,5 In contrast, deletion of the ACCH
domain ablated membrane affinity, as evidenced by a complete redistribution
of protein to the cytosol.5 Variants of
Amot80 were constructed with the Arg153Glu, Lys179Glu, or Lys193Glu
mutation based on our hypothesis that conversion of positively charged
residues into negatively charged ones will prevent association with
negatively charged PI membranes. Mutants were subcloned into a YFP
lentiviral construct for stable expression in MCF7 cells (Figure 7). The percentage
of cells in which YFP-tagged protein concentrated at cell contacts
and puncta was then compared to those having a cytosolic distribution
(Figure 8).

bars represent the standard deviation of each sample, p values against the wild-type expression: *** < 0.0005; ** <

Imaging
of the R153E, K179E, and K193E mutants revealed an increased distribution
to the cytosol versus wild-type Amot80. Because these effects were
not as complete as the effects previously observed upon deletion of
the ACCH domain, these mutants may still bind to previously described
membrane proteins in its signaling pathway. One limitation of this
approach is that many of the cells expressing the mutated protein
had an increased amount of protein expressing at cytosolic puncta.
Therefore, we fractionated the cells to better determine the amount
of YFP-tagged Amot protein associated with all membranous bodies (Figure 9). In comparison
to the wild-type protein, Amot80 containing a mutation at Arg153,
Lys179, and Lys193 led to a decrease in the Amot80 localization in
membranous fractions and increased localization in cytosolic fractions. t-tests suggest that there is no significant difference
between the amount of mutated Amot associated with the membranes and
the cytosol. However, there is a significant difference in the ratio
of membranous/cytosolic protein associations between the wild-type
and mutant proteins (p < 0.05). Furthermore, there
is no statistically significant difference between the relative associations
of the mutant protein versus the expression of the empty vector (p > 0.5). These results suggested that Arg153, Lys179,
and Lys193 all play a role in Amot association with membranes.

Discussion
This study was designed
to systematically determine the relative contribution of conserved
positively charged residues within the ACCH domain that mediate lipid
binding by Angiomotin. To this end, each lysine and arginines in the
ACCH domain was mutated into either an acidic or a neutral natural
amino acid. Each of these mutants were then subjected to initial screens
for their ability to bind lipids, characterization of the effect on
native functions and kinetic lipid binding affinity, and determination
of effects on Amot80 intracellular localization. Each of the mutants
had similar stability and were able to be purified in a similar manner
as the wild-type protein, suggesting that most mutations had little
effect on overall protein folding. Some of the key residues screened
with a glycine mutation were also confirmed using the acidic glutamate
mutation later in the study.

Two orthogonal screens were used
to identify ACCH domain mutants that had reduced lipid binding. This
was done to reduce the impact of limitations in each assay. Fluorescence
quenching has long been used to study direct interactions with naturally
fluorescent amino acids.14−16 In this work, the quencher is homogeneously mixed throughout the
MLV. Decreased quenching could then be a result of decreased membrane
association and/or decreased membrane deformation/re-organization.
We have recently reported that PE and PI lipids in this mixture phase-separated
from PC lipids, including those containing fluorophores, until the
ACCH domain reorganizes them into homogeneous membranes.9 This would suggest that our fluorescence quenching
assay may also show significant changes in fluorescence quenching
based on the mutant’s ability to reorganize phase separations
in the membrane. Therefore, we also incorporated the lipid sedimentation
assay as a screen, an assay frequently used to determine the protein’s
ability to associate with lipids.5,17,18 This assay would target changes in membrane association
without discriminating for membrane reorganization. The requirement
of having changes in membrane association from both assays serves
to assure that the mutations selected retained their native membrane
joining activity,5 a key function in regulating
itself and associated proteins to vesicles that are recycled to the
apical plasma membrane, regulating apical/basal polarity and the sequestration
of transcription cofactors responsible for controlling cellular growth,
and migration and proliferation away from the nucleus.3,10,19,20

Mutants were also tested for their ability to oligerimerize. Studies
have shown Amot heterodimerizes itself, with Amot130 and with AmotL1.10 Furthermore, the Amot80 dimerization with Amot130
causes it to localize away from actin and into cytosolic vesicles
in a similar pattern as an Amot80 homodimer.10 The amino acid sequence suggests that this domain contains coiled
coils, which may mediate this ability to form dimers. Therefore, we
chose to eliminate those mutations that lost the ability to form dimers
as we have hypothesized that this function is critical to the ability
to deform and fuse membranes.21 The literature
is also unclear as to whether the ability to form dimers is critical
for membrane association. Hence, our screening assays would not be
able to account for the loss of this dimer formation as the driving
force for the decreased membrane affinity for membrane or the loss
of cellular protein enrichment and localization. As a result, we utilized
size exclusion chromatography to eliminate the Arg85 mutations from
further study as it only formed monomers.

The lipid binding
affinity for the remaining eight mutants was then characterized. Unlike
the fluorescence quenching assays, in the PLO assay, the lipid is
completely adsorbed to the surface of the nitrocellulose, thereby
allowing for more contact with all of the lipids. The combination
of the two studies allowed us to accurately determine which mutations
had the greatest effect on lipid binding. The fluorescence quenching
assay showed the largest decrease in the lipid binding affinity for
Arg52, Lys87, and Lys179, while the PLO assay showed similar trends.
Mutating Lys87 led to a more significant change in binding for the
rest of these mutations except Arg219. The differences in the binding
affinities reported can be accounted for by the difference in the
presentation of the lipid concentration, as the PLO data was more
similar in scale to those previously reported using surface plasmon
resonance.5

The relative effect of
mutating these residues was then considered within the context of
the predicted secondary structure of the domain (Figure 10) and our previously predicted
structure of this domain.21 The ACCH domain
was predicted to be comprised of a coiled coil,5 where Arg52 and Lys87 are in the middle of the first α
helix and Arg153, Lys179, and Lys193 are in the middle of the second
α helix (Figure 10). Lys179 and Lys193 may be along the surface of an α helix.
However, it was not clear how close in proximity this coil would be
in reference to the aforementioned residues, Arg52 or Lys87, or how
this secondary coil assists the binding pocket in binding lipids.
In addition, all of these residue charges are conserved across all
of the Amot family members, further suggesting that they may be important
for lipid binding.

Figure 10 Predicted
secondary
structure of the ACCH domain using GOR4, where 85.66% is α-helical
(underlined), 1.64% is an extended strand, and 12.7% is randomly coiled
(italicized).

Several failed attempts have been made to
resolve the atomistic structure of this domain; however, we were able
to combine small-angle X-ray scattering and a homology model building
technique to create a theoretical model that could be tested by the
current results.21 Our theoretical model
suggests that the first α-helical region participates in forming
a dimer interface while the second helix may play a stabilizing role
in the lipid binding mechanism.21Figure 11 contains pictorial
representations of this structure while highlighting particular regions
of interest based on the current research findings in the proposed
dimer and membrane interfaces (Figure 11A,B, respectively). Interestingly, highlighting
the residues in the second helical region that were shown in this
study to mediate association (black) versus those that did not (orange)
suggests that being positioned within a defined helix decreases a
mutation’s ability to affect membrane association while being
positioned within more flexible regions of the domain may be key in
mediating charge-related membrane association (Figure 11C).

(A) Dimer interface
residues suggested to mediate membrane association. (B, C) Membrane
interface residues suggested to mediate membrane association (black)
versus the conserved arginine and lysine residues that were not found
to have a significant role in membrane association (orange).

Arg52, Arg153, and Arg166 were
identified as potential targets in preliminary screens where the arginine
had been mutated to a glycine. The mutation had no significant effect
on purification and stability, thereby suggesting nonsignificant effects
on protein folding. However, we recognize the usage of glycine as
an alternative to the reversal of charge could have a result in localized
instability in the α-helical nature of the coiled coil. Other
reports suggest that glycine can play a key role in homodimerization
of protein α helices, are predominantly oriented toward helix–helix
interfaces, and have a high occurrence at helix crossing points.22,23 Our theortical model’s first α-helical region is composed
of four main homodimerization interfaces.21 Arg52 was suggested to fall within the second interface that would
be stabilized by a knob-in-hole structure (Figure 11A). Therefore, we suggest that the introduction
of this glycine mutation would probably have a little effect. Our
theoretical model also suggests that residues 107–236 are located
outside of this dimer interface,21 potentially
playing a role in the protein–membrane interface, and that
both Arg153 and Arg166 lie within the less rigid random coil structures
on the same interface (Figure 11B). This also suggests that introduction of the glycine
mutation probably had less of an effect on the local structure of
the domain but may be able to play key roles in membrane dynamic associations.
Furthermore, we suggest that Arg153, Arg166, Lrys179, and Arg219 all
lie along the same membrane association interface while Lys193 may
lie along the opposite interface, thereby providing a potential rationale
for having flexible regions of the domain. Additionally, other studies
have suggested that arginine and lysine residues are not equivalent
in their charge, leading to potential critical differences in membrane
interactions. Joseph et al. suggests that arginine’s guanidinium
group could form up to six hydrogen bonds while lysine formed much
fewer and more flexible salt bridges.24 In this protein, we studied seven conserved arginine and four conserved
lysine residues in the predicted membrane interface region, resulting
in the identification of Arg219 as the only conserved arginine that
mediates membrane interactions. The current study used nonphosphorylated
PI, which reduced the amount of potential salt bridges that could
potentially chemically stabilize the protein–lipid association.
Further studies with various levels of PI phosphorylation are needed
to further refine the role of forming hydrogen-bond salt bridges as
a mechanism for arginine versus lysine mediated membrane association
and selectivity.

In polarized epithelial cells, Amot family
member cellular localization has major consequences on cellular phenotypes
and has been linked to the initiation of various cancers, including
renal cell carcinoma,25 highly invasive
and metastatic breast tumors,3,26,27 osteosarcoma,28,29 prostate cancer,30 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,31 hepatic carcinoma,32 ovarian
cancer,33 lung cancer,34 and gastric adenocarcinomas.35 As an adaptor protein, Amot80 has been shown to play a significant
role in redistributing protein complexes that maintain the morphology
and function of intracellular junctions and cell adhesion complexes
responsible for planar proliferation associated with normal epithelial
stratum.36 Furthermore, Amot130 cellular
localization has been shown to play a significant role in modulating
HIPPO-related growth control by redistributing cofactors YAP and TAZ,
where membrane association inhibits pro-proliferation transcription
programs37−39 and nonmembrane
association causes cell cycle activation.40,41 Therefore,
determining the effect of mutating the residues within the context
of the cellular environment was key. The full-length Amot80 cellular
localization studies suggested that mutating Lys179 and Lys193 completely
disrupted ACCH domain function. However, the cellular fractionation
results from the Arg153 mutation suggest that it had less of an effect
on lipid association in full-length Amot80 than the other two mutations.
As the live cell imaging suggests a greater change in localization,
we hypothesized that the protein may still be associated with inositol
or negatively charged headgroup containing vesicles within the cell.
Therefore, future studies should look at the role of this residue
lipid selectivity. Based on the collection of cellular works presented,
we confirmed that three residues play a significant role in lipid
binding: Arg153, Lys179, and Lys193. Further studies need to confirm
the role of Arg52 and Lys87.

Another confirmation of the role
of mutating Arg153 comes from patient data reported in the cBioPortal
for Cancer Genomics.42,43 That data suggests that mutating
the Arg153 residue in both Amot80 and Amot130 to a histidine has been
the linked to the occurrence of a stomach cancer, gastric signet ring
cell carcinoma. This correlation suggests that the loss of lipid binding
associated with this charged amino acid is linked to the initiation
and progression of stomach adenocarcinoma due to the loss of the regulation
of the adaptive function of this protein associated with the ability
to colocalize with the plasma membrane and other membranous organelles.
Specifically, the mutation of arginine to a histidine, a residue with
a lower pKa, would lead to the incorporation
and presentation of a mostly deprotonated residue. There have been
reports in other proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and tumor protein 53 (p53) where the cancer causing Arg mutation
in nonprotonated histidine can cause drastic tilting of the residue
and α-helical shifts.44 We would
hypothesize that this mutation with the ACCH domain lipid binding
would not only eliminate the charge–charge interaction with
the inositols of the membrane but may also cause tilting, creating
more steric hinderances to the interactions that support protein–lipid
interactions in that region of the C terminus. Future studies should
utilize various protonation state mutations for Arg153 as a means
to study Amot family members and their adaptive role in the signaling
pathway responsible for the initiation of oncogenic cellular phenotype.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this
work paves the way for a detailed understanding of the mechanisms
involved in ACCH domain lipid binding. We hypothesized that the ACCH
domain had a similar mechanism to other phosphatidylinositol binding
membranes, where basic residue patches mediate the affinity. This
study used a detailed screening of the lysines and arginines to determine
their individual roles in mediating this function and found three
residues that appear to play a significant role in this membrane affinity
while having little to no effect on other native domain functions.
Furthermore, we were able to determine that these three residues (Arg153,
Lys179, and Lys193), which are predicted to lie along the same face
of the α helix providing a positively charged surface to contact
the negatively charged membrane,21 significantly
increased cytosolic localization of full-length Amot80. Because mutation
of one of these residues is linked to the initiation of stomach cancer,
future studies may expand on the results here to determine how mutations
in this residue effects, and the resulting loss of Amot membrane association,
may influence the appearance of stomach cancerous phenotypes.

Experimental
Materials
N-(5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (dansyl DHPE) and SYPRO
Red Protein Gel Stain was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies
(Grand Island, NY). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE), soy l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI), and ovine
wool cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL). Dodecyl thiomaltopyranoside was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee,
OH). All other materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh,
PA). Unless otherwise noted, the buffer solution used for all experiments
contained 50 mM Tris, 600 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT, 4 mM benzamidine, and 24.7 μM dodecyl thiomaltopyranoside
(elution buffer).

Plasmids
The ACCH domain sequence was previously cloned into the pGEX vector.1,5,45−47 Mutations in the DNA sequence were cloned
into the vector using Pfu polymerase AD in a site-directed mutagenesis
polymerase chain reaction. Lentiviral yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
full-length Amot80 constructs from a previous report were used to
clone in DNA fragments containing specific mutations (Genewiz) for
expression as full-length protein.3

Protein Purification
The Amot ACCH
domain cDNA was subcloned into the pGEX expression plasmid and transformed
into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells.48 Cells were grown in 2× TY medium with 100
mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(0.1 mM) was used to induce protein synthesis at 16 °C overnight.
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, solubilized in lysis buffer
(phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1 mM DTT, 4 mM benzamidine,
and 24.7 μM dodecyl thiomaltopyranoside), and lysed using 50
g/L lysozyme,49 and the lysate was then
collected by centrifugation.50−52 Proteins were purified using batch purification of glutathione resin53−55 and eluted with an additional
50 mM glutathione. The proteins were analyzed for purity using SDS–PAGE
and concentrated using a 10 kDa filter tube to ≥32 μM.

Liposome Preparation
Following
previously described methods, MLV liposomes were prepared by hydrating
10–60 mg of lyophilized lipid powder in 1–6 mL buffer
solution to make a final lipid concentration of 10 mM.56,57 To ensure complete mixing, solutions were heated above their melting
temperatures to 90 °C for an hour, put through three freeze/thaw
cycles, and then sonicated for over an hour on an ice bath. The lipid
mixture was equilibrated for more than 3–5 days and stored
at 4 °C.

Consensus Sequence Identification
The Weblogo tool (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/) was
used to generate the consensus sequence of Amot80/130, AmotL1, and
AmotL2 sequences.58 Furthermore, the tool
was used to generate a pictorial representation of the conservation
of our library of mutations at the lysine and arginine residues.

Fluorescence Quenching
We have
modified previously reported methods for intrinsic fluorescence quenching
by substrates16,59 to determine quenching of intrinsic
tyrosine residues within the ACCH domain as there are no native tryptophan
residues. The protein (7 μM) was incubated with liposomes containing
5 mol % dansyl DHPE (tyrosine quencher) at the respective concentrations.
Mutation screens were performed against 20 mM lipid (POPC/POPE/PI,
3/1/1 mol fraction). Assays were run using a 384-well black plate
(Nunc #264556) and measured using the Molecular Devices Flexstation
II 384, where the data was collected using SoftMax Pro v5.3. Biological
triplicate measurements were taken based on the tyrosine fluorescence
(274 nm excitation/303 nm emission). Changes in tyrosine fluorescence
(F) due to each lipid concentration (i) are reported
as %Fluorescence using the following equation 1  

The fluorescence
quenching data for a series of lipid concentrations were then fit
to the four-parameter sigmoidal equation using SigmaPlot (version
10.0, StatSys) to determine the AC50, the point where 50%
of the tyrosine emission was quenched. All data represent the average
of three independent experiments. 2  

The AC50 was used as a relative
measurement for when half of the protein has bound to the liposomes,
a general measure of lipid affinity changes. In the mutation analysis,
all of the tyrosines, except for Tyr118, were mutated into phenylalanine,
allowing one tyrosine to be the fluorescent probe to test for quenching
as function of the POPC/POPE/soy PI (3/1/1 molar ratio) multilamellar
vesicle concentration.

Sedimentation
Assay
We modified the lipid sedimentation assay previously
described by Heller et al.5 to study 20
μM ACCH domain protein affinity for 15 mM lipid with the following
modifications. Twenty microliters of ethanol was added to both the
lipid pellet and the liquid supernatant sample to solubilize the lipid
prior to running a 12% SDS–PAGE gel. Gels were stained using
Coomassie blue stain and analyzed using ImageJ version 1.47t. The
area and mean were used to calculate the integrated density of each
band. Fractions of lipid-bound versus unbound protein were calculated
for each mutant and compared against the fraction for the wild type
(protein with no mutation) to determine decreases in lipid binding.
The percent change in binding between the native protein and the mutant
protein of this ratio was then reported.

Characterization of Protein Oligomer State
Purified
GST-tagged ACCH domain proteins had their GST tag removed using a
previously described methodology using thrombin.5 Thrombin was removed using 50 kDa centrifugal filters (Millipore).
Supernatants were then loaded onto a glutathione resin column, and
eluants containing the cleaved protein were collected and concentrated.
The purified protein was then loaded onto a Superdex 75 Prep Grade
resin (GE Healthcare) column previously equilibrated with the elution
buffer and calibrated with low- and high-molecular-weight gel filtration
calibration kits (Millipore).

Protein
Lipid Overlay (PLO) Assay
The protein lipid overlay (PLO)
assay was performed as previously described,60 with the following procedural modifications. Previously described
liposomes were diluted, incubated for 1 h, and then blotted onto the
nitrocellulose membrane (Ambersham Hybond ECL Membrane, GE Healthcare).
The membrane was then blocked at room temperature for 30 min in PBS
buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X and 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. The
membrane was then incubated for an additional 30 min in 2 μM
purified protein, washed in PBST, and incubated with the anti-GST
antibody DyLight 680 conjugate (1/1000 dilution) (MA4-004-D680, Thermo
Scientific). The membrane was rinsed in PBST, and the bound protein
was then analyzed using a LiCOR Biosciences imaging station where
the fluorescence intensity was analyzed using Odyssey v1.2 as previously
reported.3

Mammalian Cell Culture
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293
T cells and MCF7 cells (C. Wells, Indiana University School of Medicine)
were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (v/v).
Transfections and lentiviral production were carried out in HEK293T
cells, and stable viral infection were carried out in MCF7 cells as
previously described.3,20 Live cell fluorescence images
were acquired, and the images were processed and analyzed using Zeiss
Axiovision (v. 4.8) using a methodology previously described.5,20 Cells were also separated into their nuclear, cytosolic, and membranous
components (BioVision K270-50) as previously described.61−65 Aliquots of each fraction (2 μg) were
then analyzed for their YFP fluorescence to determine the relative
percentage of the YFP-tagged Amot80 found in each fraction.
