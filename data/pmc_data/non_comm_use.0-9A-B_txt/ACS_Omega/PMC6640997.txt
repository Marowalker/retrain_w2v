A novel
class of injection-molded, toughened biocomposites was
engineered from pyrolyzed miscanthus-based biocarbon, poly(octene
ethylene) elastomer, and polypropylene (PP). The elastomer and biocarbon
were added to the PP matrix at 30 and 20 wt %, respectively. The particle
size of the biocarbon varied within two main ranges: <20 and 106–125
μm. The morphology and adhesion between the filler and the matrix
were controlled by the addition of maleic anhydride grafted PP (MAPP).
The composites were melt-blended and then injection-molded to tensile,
flexural, and impact bars. The results showed that although the morphology
of the composite is almost independent of particle size it is greatly
dependent on the addition of MAPP. Two completely different morphologies,
separate dispersion and encapsulated filler particles, were obtained
in the presence and absence of MAPP, which was verified by atomic
force and scanning electron microscopies. Model calculations based
on a modified Kerner equation showed that the encapsulated filler
content decreased from 64 to 8% by the addition of MAPP, which caused
a major improvement in the stiffness and strength of the composites.
Despite having a different morphology caused by the compatibilizer,
composites with smaller particles exhibited better strength and modulus
and lower impact toughness compared to those with a larger particle
size. Results suggest that the failure mechanisms are mainly controlled
by the local fracturing of biocarbon particles, which was more pronounced
when the particle size was larger.

Introduction
Particulate-filled
polypropylene (PP)-based composites are one
the main categories of polymer composites that have been researched
and utilized in academia and industry over the last few decades.1−3 The properties of these composites are usually determined by their
two main constituents, namely, a hard particulate filler and a rubber
phase. Through proper selection of the filler and rubber phase, a
diverse range of properties can be obtained. This flexibility in their
properties combined with their affordable price has allowed these
composites to pass the stringent requirements of the automotive industry;
thus, they have become a central material for many of the interior
and exterior parts of a car.3 However,
because of sustainability issues, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
and the advent of natural fillers, a significant amount of research
has been focused on replacing traditional mineral- or petroleum-based
fillers with biobased fillers.4−6 In the U.S., a new corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) standard has been set in response to increasing
GHG emissions, which requires vehicles to have better fuel economy.7 This can be achieved through weight reduction
by utilizing materials with lower densities. Biobased fillers, having
a naturally lower density compared to that of mineral ones, can provide
the added benefit of being lighter weight. Therefore, replacing mineral-based
fillers with biobased ones not only alleviates the sustainability
issues but also may provide an improvement in properties, such as
density, in which mineral-filled composites have reached their limits.8,9 Moreover, replacing a portion of petroleum-based matrices with biobased
fillers will provide further sustainability for currently used petroleum-based
composites.

Although replacing mineral fillers with natural
materials seems
to be a simple solution to the density problem, it creates a lot of
challenges with regard to producing composites with comparable mechanical
properties. Normally, composites exist on either end of a spectrum
in which they have either high stiffness and low impact toughness
or high impact toughness and low stiffness. The main challenge is
to keep the balance between stiffness and toughness in the final composites
because there is a trade-off between these two properties.10

Besides the inherent properties of the
filler and rubber constituents,
one important factor that affects the properties of a multicomponent
system consisting of two or more polymeric phases and filler is the
morphology of phases within the composites. Earlier studies on multicomponent
PP composites revealed that two main structures are commonly generated
when the constituents are mixed together. The first is that the filler
particles and the rubber phase (being dispersed in the PP matrix)
separate from each other, and the second is that the rubber partially
or fully encapsulates the filler particles.11,12 Several studies1,11,13 on CaCO3, BaSO4, and other forms of filled,
toughened PP showed that the final structure is determined by adhesion
between the components and the external shear forces experienced during
the melt mixing process. Different morphologies can be produced by
changing the particle size and/or by modifying the chemical nature
of the particle’s surface or the polymer.1,13 Hammer
et al.1 investigated the effect of different
particle sizes of BaSO4 in PP/ethylene propylene rubber
(EPR) composites. Their results suggested that a smaller particle
size (up to 0.7 μm) may provide better impact toughness in the
case of an encapsulated structure.

Several studies were also
conducted on particulate lignocellulosic
filler composites.14−16 These studies, which are focused mainly on wood flour
as a renewable filler, magnify the dissimilar failure mechanisms between
lignocellulosic-based fillers and mineral fillers. For example, the
effect of particle size when using wood flour was investigated in
a PP/ethylene propylene diene (EPDM) system,16 and unlike the results of Hammer et al.,1 composites with larger wood particles showed better impact toughness.
The main differences between lignocellulosic and traditional mineral
fillers are particle size and the integrity of the particles themselves.
While mineral fillers are usually available in micrometer and submicrometer
sizes, the original particle size of lignocellulosic-based fillers
can be quite large. Therefore, it is of practical importance to determine
how small the particles should be to perform in a manner that is desirable.
Furthermore, traditional fillers such as talc, silica, CaCO3, and BaSO4 hardly break during impact or under a tensile
load, whereas filler breakage is very common in lignocellulosic-based
fillers such as wood.17,18 This particle failure changes
the status of the local stress in the composite and produces a different
failure mechanism in composites with lignocellulosic-based fillers.15

Besides wood flour, biocarbon is another
biobased particulate filler
that has been the focus of interest in recent years.19−24 The density of biocarbon is reported to be in the range 1.34–1.96
g/cm3,25 which is considerably
lower than that of mineral fillers and therefore can be used to reduce
the weight of the final composite. Although biocarbon has been used
in several polymeric matrices, the structure–property relationships
of a ternary composite (thermoplastic, elastomer, and a hard filler
system) have not been studied. In this work, the effect of biocarbon
particle size and the addition of a functionalized PP-based compatibilizer
on the structure and properties of the resulting biocomposites has
been investigated. Changes in the thermal and mechanical properties
were related to the structural differences and compared to currently
available theories for multicomponent PP-based composites.

and Discussion
Particle Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM) images of biocarbons in the two particle size ranges described
are shown in Figure 1. Because mechanical sieving was used to separate the particles,
any particle that has a cross-sectional area within the range of openings
in the sieve would be trapped between the sieves. Therefore, particles
of a greater length may have been trapped between the designated sieves.
The overall shape of the particles was irregular, with a tendency
to have an aspect ratio greater than 1. This correlates well with
the findings of Nagarajan et al.20 on the
size fractionation of miscanthus-based biocarbon.

The thermal degradation
of these biocarbons is depicted in Figure 2. It appeared that
<20 μm particles had almost half of the ash content as that
of the 106–125 μm particles (Table 1).

The ash mainly consisted of silica (Figure S2) and is believed to originate from the epidermis of the
plant material.29 Therefore, the lower
ash content of the smaller particles can be correlated to the lower
grindability of their mineral content.

Composite Characterization
Strength
and Stiffness
The mechanical properties of
the PP/POE (base blend), PP/POE with MAPP, and biocarbon-based biocomposites
with and without compatibilizer are presented in Figures 3 and 7. In all of the blends and composites, the tensile strength was determined
from the yield point of the stress–strain curve and hence is
equal to the tensile stress at yield. A few important characteristics
of the biocomposites can be observed by comparing the tensile or maximum
flexural stress of the samples. First, the addition of biocarbon resulted
in a reduction in the tensile strength compared to that of the base
blend. Second, the addition of MAPP to the PP/POE binary blend reduced
its tensile strength, but when MAPP was added to the composites, the
tensile strength of the composite systems improved. In general, the
tensile strength is strongly dependent on the transfer of stress between
the particles and the matrix.30 Strength
analysis showed that the addition of biocarbon, regardless of the
two particle size ranges tested, reduced the tensile strength, which
suggests that the particles were poorly bonded to the matrix. However,
when a compatibilizer was added, this transfer became more efficient
and hence the strength improved significantly. This suggests that
MAPP acts as a compatibilizer and promotes adhesion between the filler
particles and the matrix. Similarly, Renner et al.31 found that the application of MAPP results in an improvement
of the adhesive force from about 100 mJ/m2 to nearly 1000
mJ/m2 in PP/CaCO3 and PP/glass bead composites.

and (b) flexural properties of (A) PP/POE, (B) PP/POE

small particles, and (F) small particles with MAPP.

The tensile strength of smaller particle composites
was higher
both with and without MAPP compared to that of larger particle composites.
In general, this behavior can be related to the higher total surface
area available with smaller particles. The increase in tensile strength
with decreasing particle size (or increasing surface area) indicates
that a more efficient stress transfer mechanism is involved, especially
when MAPP is added to the composites.30 It can be observed that compatibilized smaller particles had a tensile
strength almost equal to that of the base binary blend. This is an
additional evidence indicating that the observed improvement is directly
related to the interaction of PP with the surface of the particles.

To obtain an estimate of interfacial interactions, a semiempirical
model developed by Turcsányi et al.32 was used. This model relates the changes in the yield strength of
a composite to the properties of the interface. 1  where
σyc, σym and φ are the yield
strength of the composite, the yield strength
of the matrix, and the filler volume fraction, respectively. Parameter B is related to the load-bearing capacity of the particles,
which depends on the interface strength and the filler’s size
and contact area.33Table 2 shows the B values for
the uncompatibilized and MAPP-compatibilized biocarbon composites.
The addition of MAPP caused a similar improvement in the B value for particles in both size ranges, which can be related to
the improvement of the interface, as suggested by microscopy. The B value is slightly higher for smaller particles, which
agrees with the well-established trend that smaller particles have
bigger values because of their higher specific surface area.32

and Compatibilized Biocarbon Composites

Besides
being an important structural characteristic of materials,
the stiffness of a ternary composite offers valuable information about
its internal structure. It has been established that, unlike the tensile
stress at yield, an improvement in the adhesion strength between a
filler and matrix does not change the value of the elastic modulus.14,30 However, in this system, the addition of MAPP increased the modulus
values for both small and large particles even though the addition
of MAPP alone decreased the tensile modulus of the PP/POE blend (Figure 3). This indicates
that other mechanisms are also involved when MAPP is added to the
system, which changes the structure of the composite profoundly. In
ternary composites where both rubber and hard filler were added to
the matrix, either the filler and rubber are dispersed separately
in the matrix or the rubber phase tends to fully or partially encapsulate
the hard filler particles.11−13 Dubnikova et al.11 observed that the relative modulus (ratio of the composite
modulus to the binary blend of PP and rubber) of the composites remains
unchanged through the addition of fillers in the case of rubber encapsulation
of filler particles. However, in the case of a separate dispersion,
the modulus increased with the addition of filler. As can be observed
from the composites without the compatibilizer, the tensile modulus
of the composites (both for small and large particles) remains statistically
insignificant. This is in good agreement with the findings of Dubnikova
et al.11 Therefore, the only way that the
addition of MAPP could have improved the modulus of the system is
to limit the encapsulation of the biocarbon particles. This phenomenon
can be confirmed through SEM images of etched, cryofractured surfaces.
As can be seen from Figures 4 and 5, after etching the rubber phase
from the uncompatibilized composites, all of the biocarbon particles
were surrounded by voids representing the etched rubber phase.

Figure 4 SEM images
of impact-fractured (a, b; 2000×) and etched, cryofractured
(c, d; 8000×) surfaces of the small particle composites with
5% MAPP (left) and without compatibilizer (right).

cryofractured
(c, d; 2000×) surfaces of the large particle composites with
5% MAPP (left) and without compatibilizer (right).

On the other hand, the interphase between the biocarbon
particles
and the matrix in the compatibilized samples is free of any visible
voids in most of the detected particles. This suggests that the rubber
is more dispersed in the PP phase rather than encapsulating the particles,
hence confirming the change in morphology that was expected from the
stiffness analysis above. High-resolution AFM scans of the biocarbon
interface in the presence and absence of MAPP are shown in Figure 6. In both images,
the green color represents the phase with the lowest modulus, which
is the POE phase. The blue and pink colors represent stiffer phases,
which are PP, MAPP, and biocarbon particles. As can be observed from Figure 6a, biocarbon particles
in the compatibilized composites are surrounded mainly by the blue
phases, whereas in the case of the uncompatibilized composite (Figure 6b), the interphase
mostly consists of the green phase. This confirms the SEM observation
that rubber is dispersed separately from biocarbon in the presence
of MAPP.

small particle composites: (a) with 5% MAPP and (b) uncompatibilized.

Since microscopy images are qualitative,
they do not provide the
right measure to evaluate the extent of encapsulation. A modified
Kerner equation34 has been shown to provide
a proper estimate to describe the effects of fillers on the modulus
of ternary composites.35−37 The theoretical modulus will be calculated from eq 2 2  where
quantities A, B, and ψ are
defined as 3   4   5  In eqs 2–5, subscripts b and f denote
binary blend and filler, respectively, and Ke, V, and φ are the Einstein coefficient,
maximum volume fraction, and volume fraction, respectively. The value
of Ke was estimated to be 2.6 for rod-shaped
particles with a length over diameter ratio of 2.5 according to estimates
from SEM images (Figure 1).34 The maximum volume fraction of fillers
was 0.64 based on the random close packing of hard spheres.38 Although the particles may not be of a uniform
spherical shape, the values should be very close for both sizes; therefore,
choosing a rough estimate will not change the conclusions. The modulus
for biocarbon was converted from Derjaguin, Muller, and Toporov (DMT)
modulus values measured by AFM for miscanthus biocarbon in a previous
study.28 The extent of encapsulation is
presented in Table 3. The calculated amount of embedded filler is the difference between
the actual filler volume fraction (13.8%) and the filler volume fraction
that will result in a similar theoretical value of the measured modulus
based on eq 1. It can
be seen from these calculations that in the presence of MAPP the dominant
structure is a separate dispersion of phases.

The addition of MAPP caused a greater improvement
in the tensile
modulus of the smaller particle size composites compared to the larger
particle size composites. The same trend can be observed from the
flexural modulus data. However, it is known that particle size on
the microscale level has little influence on the elastic modulus of
a composite.30 Taking encapsulation theory
into consideration, the balance between the adhesion strength and
shear stress determines the extent of encapsulation.12 Therefore, smaller particles, which have a higher adhesion
strength, should have a greater extent of encapsulation than larger
ones.16 On the basis of this theory, after
the addition of a compatibilizer and a separate dispersion of phases,
the moduli of both the large and small particle size systems should
be similar or even higher in the case with larger particles. The unexpected
lower modulus of the large particle size composite can be attributed
to the presence of holes (Figures 1 and 4) within the structure
of large biocarbon particles (originating from the lumen structure
of miscanthus grass). These holes, which were absent in the smaller
particles (Figure 1), can produce voids in the final composites that reduce the final
modulus values.39 This caused an artificial
inflation of the embedded filler value in Table 3 for the large particle composite. In general,
the calculated modulus values for smaller particles look more reasonable
when compared to the SEM images (Figure 4). Nevertheless, the differences observed
between the measured moduli of the larger and smaller particles in
the separate dispersion morphology may not be of practical significance.

The notched Izod impact strength is plotted against biocarbon particle
size in Figure 7. Additionally, the effect of MAPP is also
shown in this figure. In all cases, the impact toughness was greatly
reduced compared to that of the base binary blend. The changes in
the extent of encapsulation of the particles caused significant differences
in the impact strength of the composites. Molnár et al.37 showed that although the extent of encapsulation
affects the impact resistance of PP/ethylene propylene rubber and
BaSO4 composites, encapsulation alone cannot explain the
variation in the impact resistance.

break of (A) PP/POE, (B)
PP/POE with MAPP, (C) large particles, (D) large particles with MAPP,
(E) small particles, and (F) small particles with MAPP.

SEM images of the impact fracture surfaces in the
presence and
absence of MAPP (panels a and b in Figures 4 and 5) provide some
useful information regarding the fracture mechanism. In the absence
of MAPP, a lot of particles can be seen in the fractured surface in
both the small and large particle composites. This suggests that the
impact path either went through the particle interface or fractured
the particles themselves. On the other hand, in the presence of MAPP,
a lower number of particles can be observed in the fractured surface,
which suggests that the fracture path went mainly through the toughened
matrix. This suggests that in the case where many particles are observable
in the fracture surface, the particle interfaces were the weak points
of the system, which caused the considerable loss of impact toughness.
The addition of MAPP replaces this defective interface with a stronger
interphase, which results in an impact improvement for both particle
size ranges.

Although the two series of composites (with large
and small particles)
had similar impact strengths in the encapsulated structure, the impact
strength showed a larger improvement in composites with larger particles
after the addition of MAPP. It has been reported that fracture and/or
debonding of large wood flour particles (160 μm) plays an important
role in the local deformation process of MAPP-compatibilized PP/EPDM/wood
composites.16 Likewise, impact results
of Keledi et al.14 on PP/EPDM/wood composites
revealed that debonding is the main micromechanical deformation mechanism
taking place during the impact fracture of these ternary composites.
The larger particles have less surface area; therefore, debonding
can happen more easily in comparison with small particles.16 Consequently, more debonding is expected to
occur in composites with larger particles. Additionally, the fracture
of particles requires that energy is expended, which is also expected
to be greater for larger particles since smaller ones may not even
break (fewer holes exist in the smaller particles). The sum of all
of these energies together can further improve the impact toughness
of larger particles over smaller ones. Figure 4a shows that even in the presence of MAPP
a significant number of broken large biocarbon particles are observable,
which confirms the above idea and contributes to their higher impact
toughness compared to that of the smaller particle size composites.

The effect of MAPP addition and morphology changes in the tan δ
shift of the base blend and biocomposites are shown in Figure 8. Two tan δ peaks were
observed around 13 and −40 °C, corresponding to the glass
transition temperatures (Tg) of PP and
POE, respectively. In both uncompatibilized biocomposites, the location
of the tan δ peaks for PP and POE did not change from that for
the base blend. However, when MAPP was added to the biocomposites,
the Tg of PP shifted to a higher temperature,
suggesting that more PP chains were immobilized. On the other hand,
the Tg of POE was shifted to a lower temperature,
which indicates that POE chains were more mobile. Premphet et al.36 observed this in PP/POE/CaCO3 composites.
These changes were more pronounced for small particle size composites.
These observations are in good accord with the morphological changes
caused by the addition of MAPP and the theoretical calculations of
the extent of encapsulation (Table 3).

(b) PP/POE
with MAPP, (c) small particles, (d) small particles with MAPP, (e)
large particles, and (f) large particles with MAPP.

The DSC crystallization exotherms of the PP/POE
blend and the composite
systems are depicted in Figure 9. It is evident that despite the differences in their structures,
the composite samples shifted the crystallization peak of PP toward
higher temperatures. This effect is more pronounced in the case with
larger biocarbon particles.

Figure 9 DSC graph of the first cooling cycle for the
matrix and biocomposites.

However, no significant difference was observed in the crystallinity
of the samples. The higher ash content (11.5 wt %) in the larger particle
size range compared to the smaller range (6.3 wt %) could be the reason
for the nucleating behavior of the composites with a larger particle
size. As shown in Figure S2, the ash mainly
consists of silica. It has been shown that SiO2 can increase
the crystallization temperature of isotactic PP.40 A positive shift in the crystallization temperature has
been observed by Das et al.41 in PP pine
wood biocarbon composites (13 wt %).

Conclusions
In
summary, the results presented in this work show that the properties
of the composites are less dependent on the particle size of the biocarbon
in the encapsulated morphology because the rubber phase masks the
properties of the filler by intervening in the load transfer between
PP and the biocarbon, whereas in the separate dispersion (with compatibilizer)
the properties of the composites strongly changed with the size of
the particles. In the separate dispersion morphology, the smaller
particles provide better stiffness and strength, whereas the larger
ones were more efficient in terms of impact toughness. The addition
of MAPP can significantly change the structure of the PP/POE/biocarbon
composites. The encapsulated morphology, which is the result of an
uncompatibilized mixture, possesses low stiffness and toughness values
in the ternary systems, which limits the application of such composites.
The addition of the compatibilizer caused a simultaneous improvement
in the stiffness and toughness of the system caused by the separate
dispersion of the phases. This yields a composite with a better stiffness–toughness
balance, which widens the application of such biocomposites. These
composites benefit from having lower densities and more biobased content
as compared to common mineral-filled composites. This study investigates
the mechanism governing the interaction between the compatibilizer
and biocarbon, laying the foundation for understanding the reinforcing
mechanism of such materials. The use of renewable fillers like biocarbon
is still in its infancy, and more fundamental studies are required
to reveal the underlying mechanisms.

Experimental Section
In this study, miscanthus biocarbon (BC), which was hammer milled
to ∼400 μm (1/64 in.), was received from Competitive
Green Technologies, Leamington, ON, Canada. This biocarbon was produced
through a slow pyrolysis process at ∼630 °C. In this process,
after a predrying cycle, 300 kg of the chopped miscanthus grass was
conveyed through the pyrolysis chamber using an auger system, which
took 15 min from entrance to exit. The whole chamber was set at the
above-mentioned temperatures. The functionalities are still present,
as evident from the FTIR spectra (Figure S1).

Injection molding grade PP pellets (trade name 1335Z) were
from
Pinnacle Polymers LLC, LA, USA. The melt flow index (MFI) at 230 °C/2.16
kg and the density of PP were 35 g/10 min and 0.9 g/cm3 according to the material’s datasheet, respectively. The
polyolefin elastomer used was an ethylene-octene copolymer (POE),
a product of Dow Chemical Company (trade name Engage 8137), in the
form of pellets. The MFI at 190 °C/2.16 kg and the density of
POE were 13 g/10 min and 0.866 g/cm3, respectively. A maleic
anhydride grafted PP (MAPP) copolymer was added to produce preferential
adhesion between the particles and PP. The MAPP used in this study
was Fusabond P353, a product of DuPont (Wilmington, DE).

To
obtain the desired particle size range, the as received biocarbon
batch was sieved to two particle size ranges, 106–125 and <20
μm, separately using a Ro-Tap sieve shaker (W.S. Tyler, OH,
USA) fitted with appropriate Tyler sieves. The schematic of this fractionation
is shown in Figure 10. To efficiently remove the unwanted particles smaller than 106 μm
from the surface of bigger particles, 106–125 μm biocarbon
particles were sieved again using an air-assisted sieving machine
(Air-jet 200, Retsch, Germany). Biocarbon particles remaining on top
of the 106 μm sieve were collected and used for all characterizations
and biocomposite fabrication. The two ranges, 106–125 and <20
μm, were determined from the American Standard Test Sieve Series
in a way that both would have a similar size distribution width of
20 μm and have 1 order of magnitude difference in the size range.
This would make the results independent of the size distribution width
(as much as possible by this method of fractionation) and produce
enough of a size difference to investigate the effect of particle
size on the properties of the biocomposites.

setup on a Ro-Tap sieve shaker.

All formulations were melt processed at 190 °C, at a
screw
speed of 100 rpm (co-rotating), for a period of 120 s in a DSM Xplore
micro compounder with a length over diameter ratio (L/D) of 18 (DSM
Xplore, The Netherlands) and then transferred to a DSM Xplore 12 cc
injection molding machine to make the test specimens. The injection,
packing, and holding pressures and duration were 4, 8, and 8 bar and
4, 6, and 10 s, respectively. The temperature of the mold was kept
constant at 40 °C during all injections. Table 4 shows all of the formulations and corresponding
designations used in this study.

Thermal behavior of the samples
was analyzed with a DSC Q200 (TA

pieces of about 10 mg were shaved from the core portion of an untested

at a rate of 10 °C/min, subsequently cooled to −50 °C
with a 5 °C/min ramp, and then reheated to 220 °C at a 10

carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Q400, TA Instruments,
USA) according to ASTM E1131-08. These tests studied the weight loss
profile in a three-step process starting with a nitrogen atmosphere
and then switching to an oxidative environment. During the first step,
the biocarbon was kept at 110 °C for 15 min under nitrogen purge
to remove moisture and highly volatile compounds. At this point, the
sample weight was reset to 100% so that the TGA curve represents only
the medium and nonvolatile portion of the samples. In the second step,
the temperature was set to reach 950 °C with a 50 °C/min
ramp rate and then remained isothermal for another 15 min. In the
third step, the gas was switched to air and the material underwent
a 10 min isothermal cycle at 950 °C. The results were produced
in duplicates.

Viscoelastic behavior of the samples was investigated
using a DMA
Q800 (TA Instruments, USA) in dual cantilever mode. Samples were tested
by heating from −110 to 150 °C with a 3 °C/min ramp
rate, a 1 Hz frequency, and a 0.1% strain (equal to 40 μm amplitude,
tested to be within the linear viscoelastic range). The results were
generated in duplicates.

Tensile properties of the composites
were measured by Instron universal
testing machine (Norwood, MA). Type IV specimens were tested as per
the ASTM D638-14 protocol with a test speed of 50 mm/min at room temperature
and with 50% relative humidity. Flexural properties were measured
as per ASTM D790-15 (procedure B), with a crosshead speed of 14 mm/min
and a span length of 52 mm. The impact strength of the samples was
measured in accordance with ASTM D256-10. The samples were notched
48 h prior to testing. The tests were conducted on a TMI monitor impact
tester (Testing Machine Inc. DE, USA) with 5 ft lb pendulum at room
temperature. Five replicates were tested for each of the mechanical
tests.

The biocarbon particles and the fracture surface morphologies
were
observed by SEM (Phenom ProX, Phenom World BV, Netherlands) equipped
with a backscattering electron. A Cressington sputter coater 108 was
used to gold coat the composite samples for 15 s under an argon atmosphere.
Impact samples were cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature and then
fractured using an impact tester. Cryofractured samples were etched
using normal heptane to remove the POE phase. Samples were immersed
in 50 °C n-heptane for 3.5 h and dried using
a vacuum oven before gold coating.

To observe the interface
of the biocarbon and matrix, high-resolution
AFM was performed. All samples were polished using an ultra microtome
(Leica Ultracut, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) before the scans. The scans
were performed under peak force quantitative nano-mechanical (PFQNM)
mode with a TAP525 probe to obtain modulus mapping of the samples.
Details of the analysis and calibration are reported elsewhere.27,28
