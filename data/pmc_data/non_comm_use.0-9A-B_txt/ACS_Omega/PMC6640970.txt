The interfacial structure and activity
for the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) were investigated on a PtNi surface alloy on a Pt(111)
electrode (PtNi/Pt(111)). The PtNi surface alloy was prepared by thermal
annealing of Ni2+ modified on Pt(111) at 573–803
K. After optimizing the alloying temperature and the amount of added
Ni, the ORR current density of PtNi/Pt(111) at 0.9 V (reversible hydrogen
electrode) is enhanced 9.5 times compared with that of Pt(111), and
the activity is decreased by 24% after 1000 potential cycles. The
atomic composition and subsurface structure of PtNi/Pt(111) were determined
by in situ infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy and
X-ray diffraction. The surface contains a (111)-oriented Pt-skin and
the subsurface of the 2nd–5th layers of the PtNi alloy contains
less than 11% Ni atoms. The layer spacings of the surface alloy layers
are slightly expanded compared with those of bare Pt(111). Homogeneous
alloying with a small amount of Ni in the subsurface layers achieves
the high ORR activity and durability.

Introduction
The enhancement of the activity of cathode
catalysts for the oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the widespread use of polymer
electrolyte fuel cells at low cost. Bimetallic alloys comprising Pt
and base metals have been widely studied as ORR catalysts. In particular,
Pt alloyed with iron group elements, such as PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe,
show high mass activity for ORR compared with that of commercial Pt/C
catalysts.1−5 The perturbation of electronic structure induced by the heterometal
activates the ORR. Stamenkovic et al. have reported a volcano-type
relationship between the ORR activity and the d-band center of Pt
alloys; Pt3Ni, Pt3Co, and Pt3Fe show
high ORR activities.6 The surface compositions
of Pt-base metal alloys affect their electronic structures. On Pt-base
polycrystalline alloys, the ORR activity and the durability are enhanced
by the Pt-skin structure.7 As for the surface
composition of the Pt-alloy particles, most of the alloys have a Pt-skin
shell and an alloyed core.8,9

Single crystal
electrodes are useful for understanding the relationship
between ORR activity and surface structure. The atomic arrangement
of the Pt surface significantly affects the electrocatalytic reactions;
the ORR current density at 0.9 V (reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE))
increases in the order of Pt(100) < Pt(110)-(1 × 1) < Pt(111)
< Pt(110)-(1 × 2).10,11 The active site for
ORR has been studied using the high index planes of the Pt single
crystal; the ORR activity on the (111) terrace with (111) and (100)
step structures was higher than that on the (100) terrace with step
structures.12 The dependence of ORR activity
on the surface structure also appears on Pt3Ni and Pt3Co alloy single crystal electrodes.13−15 The ORR current
density at 0.9 V (RHE) for Pt3Ni(111) was 10 times higher
than that for Pt(111), and the compositions of the Pt-skin surface
and alloyed subsurface have been revealed.16

Recently, the ORR activity has been widely investigated on
various
surface alloys formed on single crystal electrodes.17−23 The surface composition and structure of the surface alloy can be
easily controlled by the preparation conditions. Wadayama et al. have
evaluated the ORR activity of the PtNi/Pt(111) electrode prepared
by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and revealed the dependence of the
surface structure and the ORR activity on the alloying temperature.17 Attard et al. have prepared Ru quasi single
crystal surfaces and PtNi alloys on Pt(111) modified by wet and annealing
processes and revealed that the PtNi alloys on Pt(111) show the repeating
effects of the modification and annealing process.18,19 These PtNi surface alloys on Pt(111) activate the ORR as much as
Pt3Ni(111). However, there are no reports on the detailed
subsurface structure of the PtNi surface alloy electrode. Because
the activity of the Pt alloy electrode is mostly governed by the subsurface
composition and lattice strain, understanding the relationship between
activity and interfacial structure is important for the development
of highly active catalysts.

The surface and subsurface structures
of PtSn surface alloy on
Pt(111) have been reported for the ethanol oxidation reaction.24 In situ surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurement
revealed detailed structures of the surface and subsurface layers
of the PtSn surface alloy. Although the Sn atoms were located in the
surface layer, the elution of surface Sn atoms was restrained by the
formation of the PtSn alloy layer.

In this study, the PtNi surface
alloy on Pt(111) (PtNi/Pt(111))
was prepared by thermal annealing of Ni2+ modified on Pt(111)
under a reductive atmosphere. The annealing temperature and the amount
of added Ni2+ were optimized for the ORR. Although the
scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy provide quantitative information on the alloy layer,
their application to in situ measurements is difficult. Therefore,
the surface and subsurface structures were determined by in situ SXRD
measurement. The vibrational frequency of adsorbed carbon monoxide
(CO), which is sensitive to the surface structure, was compared in
the PtNi alloy and Pt(111) surfaces using in situ infrared reflection–absorption
spectroscopy (IRAS).

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the alloying temperature dependence of cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
and ORR voltammograms on Pt(111) modified with 300 pmol Ni2+ (equivalent to 2 ML) in 0.1 M HClO4. The CV shows the
hydrogen adsorption/desorption regions between 0.05 and 0.35 V, the
double layer region between 0.35 and 0.6 V, and the OH adsorption/desorption
regions above 0.6 V, indicating that the Pt layer is exposed on the
surface. In acidic media, Ni is oxidized or dissolved above 0.3 V.25 As there are no oxidation peaks at the first
cycle, the oxidation and dissolution of Ni do not occur. The onset
potentials of Hupd and OHad shift negatively
and positively, respectively. Similar potential shifts are also observed
on Pt3Ni(111), which result from the change of the electronic
structure of the surface Pt atoms due to alloying with Ni atoms.13

of PtNi/Pt(111)
modified with 300 pmol Ni. (b) Ni concentration dependence of CVs
and ORR voltammograms of PtNi/Pt(111) at 723 K. CVs were obtained
in 0.1 M HClO4 saturated with Ar. The scanning rate is
0.05 V s–1. ORR voltammograms were obtained in 0.1
M HClO4 saturated with O2. The scanning rate
is 0.01 V s–1 and the rotation rate of the electrode
is 1600 rpm. (c) Potential dependence of the charge density of the
oxide species above 0.6 V. (d) ORR activities of Pt(111) and PtNi/Pt(111)
at 0.9 V.

PtNi/Pt(111) annealed at 723 K
shows the highest ORR activity. Figure 1c shows the potential
dependence of the charge density of the oxide species above 0.6 V.
The total charge density of oxide formation at 0.9 V is remarkably
reduced by the alloying, and the ORR current density increases with
the decreasing oxide species. OHad is one of the blocking
factors for the ORR on Pt electrodes, and the IR band intensity of
OHad is related to the ORR activity.26,27 The d-band center shift of Pt modified with Ni weakens the adsorption
energy of OHad, which enhances the ORR activity. The alloying
at 803 K decreases the ORR activity, indicating that Ni sublimates
or migrates to the bulk.

Figure 1b shows
the Ni concentration dependence of CVs and ORR voltammograms of PtNi/Pt(111)
at 723 K in 0.1 M HClO4. The amount of added Ni also affects
the OH adsorption/desorption peaks. The ORR activity of PtNi/Pt(111)
modified with 450 pmol of Ni (equivalent of 3 ML) and annealed at
723 K is 9.5 times higher than that of Pt(111), as shown in Figure 1d.

The durability
of PtNi/Pt(111) modified with the Ni equivalent
of 3 ML was evaluated by potential cycles. Figure 2a shows CVs of PtNi/Pt(111) after 100 and
1000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V. After 100 cycles, the charge densities
of hydrogen adsorption/desorption and OH adsorption/desorption increase
dramatically. The potential cycle including the oxidation/reduction
of Pt promotes dissolution of surface Pt atoms and results in the
defective surface. The peaks at 0.13 and 0.3 V are assigned to the
hydrogen adsorption/desorption on the (110) and (100) step sites,
respectively.28 In the case of the Cu/Pt(111)
surface alloy, the potential cycle causes dealloying due to Cu dissolution
and similar CV peaks of hydrogen adsorption/desorption appear.29Figure 2b shows the potential cycle dependence of ORR voltammograms
of PtNi/Pt(111). The ORR activity at 0.9 V decreases by 24% after
500 cycles, and the activity is maintained after 1000 cycles as shown
in Figure 2c. Similar
activity reduction was reported on Pt(111) after 1000 potential cycles.30 The initial activity loss is due to the dissolution
of subsurface Ni and/or surface Pt atoms, and a stable surface alloy
layer is formed after 500 cycles. The (100) step on the Pt3Ni(111) surface activates the ORR; the ORR activities of Pt3Ni(322) and (211), which have three and five terrace atomic rows,
respectively, are higher than that of Pt3Ni(111).14 For PtNi/Pt(111) prepared by MBE, the durability
depends on the coverage of Ni. Although the degradation after 1000
cycles of PtNi/Pt(111) below 2 ML-thick Ni is more than 50% of the
initial activity, the durability is improved above 3 ML-thick Ni.30,31

in 0.1 M HClO4 saturated with Ar. The scanning rate is
0.05 V s–1. ORR voltammograms were obtained in 0.1
M HClO4 saturated with O2. The scanning rate
is 0.01 V s–1 and the rotation rate of the electrode
is 1600 rpm. (c) Cycle dependence of normalized ORR current density

The vibrational frequency of adsorbed
CO is sensitive to the surface
structure and the electronic state of the substrate. Figure 3 shows the IRAS spectra for
adsorbed CO on Pt(111) and PtNi/Pt(111) modified with the Ni equivalent
of 3 ML in 0.1 M HClO4 at 0.1 V. The reference spectra
were obtained at 0.9 V whereas the oxidation of COad on
the Pt electrode is completed. The spectra for adsorbed CO on Pt(111)
have two stretching bands around 2065 and 1780 cm–1, which are attributed to linear-bonded and multibonded CO, respectively,
forming the (2 × 2)-3CO structure.32−34

Figure 3 IRAS spectra for adsorbed
CO on Pt(111) and PtNi/Pt(111) alloyed
with 450 pmol Ni at 723 K in 0.1 M HClO4. The sample and
reference spectra were obtained at 0.1 and 0.9 V, respectively. Resolution
was 4 cm–1.

The spectra of CO adsorbed on PtNi/Pt(111) also show two
stretching
bands similar to those of CO adsorbed on Pt(111). There is no specific
band of CO adsorbed on the Ni surface. The spectra for adsorbed CO
on Ni(111) show two stretching bands around 2040 and 1900 cm–1, which are attributed to linear-bonded and bridge-bonded CO, respectively.35 This result indicates that the structural and
electronic properties of the PtNi/Pt(111) surface are similar to those
of Pt(111). In the case of PtNi/Pt(111) prepared by MBE, the surface
alloyed at low temperature shows the Ni–CO band, which indicates
that the Ni atoms are exposed on the surface layer, and the band of
bridge-bonded Pt–CO disappears after the Pt skin layer is formed
by high-temperature treatment.17,36 The frequency shift
of the Pt–CO band is caused by modification with Ni resulting
in change of its electronic structure.37 On the alloying surface, the band shift of Pt–CO depends
on the subsurface composition as well as surface structure; the band
shift increases in proportion to the amount of heteroatoms in the
surface or subsurface layers.17,20,36 The band frequencies on PtNi/Pt(111) are similar to those on Pt(111),
which suggests that the amount of Ni in the subsurface layer is very
low. Therefore, we determined the surface and subsurface structures
of PtNi/Pt(111) using SXRD.

Figure 4a shows
the specular and (0 1) crystal truncation rods (CTRs) of the PtNi/Pt(111)
in 0.1 M HClO4 at 0.5 V. The initial model used for structural
optimization comprises five Pt layers. The vertical atomic position,
occupancy factor (Occ), and Debye–Waller factors of Pt layers
were optimized by the least-squares method. Table 1 shows the structural parameters of the optimized
model. The occupancy factor of the first layer is 0.77 and it is gradually
increased below the second layer. A similar deficit of surface and
subsurface layers often appears on roughened surfaces; however, the
hydrogen adsorption/desorption waves in the CV shows a defect-free
surface. Moreover, the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on PtNi/Pt(111) are
similar to those on Pt(111), indicating that the surface has a flat
(111) domain. The band assigned to multibonded CO appears on high
index surfaces wider than 7 and 16 atomic rows on (111)-(110) and
(111)-(100), respectively.38 Because no
Ni–CO band is observed, Ni atoms are not exposed on the topmost
layer. Therefore, the Pt-skin structure with the (111) domain is formed,
and the low occupancy factor below the second layer indicates the
reduction of electron density due to the incorporation of Ni. The
topmost surface layer may be due to the excess Pt atoms resulting
from the formation of the subsurface PtNi alloy. A similar excess
Pt island layer was observed on the PtSn surface alloy.24

The X-ray
diffraction method cannot directly determine the atomic
composition of the surface or subsurface layers because the spatial
electron density contributes to the structural factor. Therefore,
we estimated the compositions of Pt (θPt) and Ni
(θNi) in each layer using the following equations 1  where ZM is the
atomic number.

Figure 4b,c shows
the optimized model of the PtNi/Pt(111) and the composition ratio
of Pt and Ni. The layer spacings of PtNi/Pt(111) are slightly expanded
compared with those of bare Pt(111).39 The
composition of Ni below the second layer is 1–11%. Although
the amount of Ni corresponding to 3 ML is modified, Ni in the 5 surface
layers is less than 0.2 ML, and residual Ni will sublimate or migrate
to the bulk during thermal annealing.

The high ORR activity
of the PtNi/Pt(111) is achieved by the electronic
perturbation between the surface Pt atoms and the subsurface Ni atoms,
similar to the case of Pt3Ni(111). However, the composition
ratio of Ni atoms in the second layer is much lower than the 52% of
Pt3Ni(111).16 This result indicates
that a small amount of subsurface Ni contributes to the activation
of the ORR. The in-plane structure of the PtNi/Pt(111) determined
by the (0 1) rod is identical to that of Pt(111). A small amount of
Ni is incorporated uniformly in the second layer without segregation.
The ORR activity depends on the alloying temperature and the amount
of the modified Ni, as described above. The appropriate diffusion
state of the Ni atoms is necessary in the second layer, and the alloying
at higher temperatures (>800 K) causes migration of Ni in the deeper
layers. The initial Ni dose of more than 600 pmol deactivates the
ORR. The increase of the initial Ni dose increases the surface segregation
of Pt due to subsurface PtNi formation, which may cause a decrease
of the interaction with subsurface Ni.

A small amount of Ni
in the subsurface improves the durability,
as shown in Figure 2c. In the Pt base metal alloy, the dissolution of the subsurface
base metal gives rise to the restructuring of the surface structure.
The reduction of base metal content will inhibit the dissolution and
destruction of the surface layer. The distribution of the Ni atoms
in the subsurface layers of the PtNi/Pt(111) contributes to the ORR
activity and durability.

Conclusions
PtNi/Pt(111) was prepared
by thermal annealing of 150–600
pmol Ni2+ modified on Pt(111) at 573–803 K. The
ORR activity of Pt(111) modified with 450 pmol Ni2+ at
723 K is 9.5 times higher than that of Pt(111), and the activity is
decreased by 24% after 1000 potential cycles. The surface and subsurface
structures of PtNi/Pt(111) were determined by IRAS and X-ray diffraction.
The surface and subsurface comprise the Pt-skin and PtNi alloy containing
a small amount of Ni (<11%), respectively. The highly uniform distribution
of Ni atoms enhances the ORR activity and the durability.

Experimental
Section
A Pt single crystal bead for voltammogram and IRAS
measurements
was prepared by Clavilier’s method.40 The crystal bead was oriented using the reflection of a He–Ne
laser and then mechanically polished with diamond slurries.41 A Pt(111) disk (8 mm in diameter, MaTech, Germany)
was used for the SXRD measurement. The Pt(111) surface was annealed
in an H2 + O2 flame and then cooled to room
temperature under an Ar atmosphere. The annealed surface was protected
with ultrapure water (Milli-Q Advantage A10; Millipore). All of the
solutions were prepared using ultrapure water. PtNi surface alloys
were prepared according to the following procedure. A solution of
75–300 μM NiCl2·6H2O that
corresponds to 1–4 monolayers (ML) (2 μL) was dropped
on the Pt(111) surface protected with ultrapure water. The surface
was dried and then annealed using an induction furnace at 573–803
K for 10 min under an Ar (95%) + H2 (5%) atmosphere. The
potential is referred to a RHE.

The ORR activity was estimated
from the kinetic current density jk at
0.90 V according to the Koutecky–Levich
equation: 1/j = 1/jk +
1/jL, where j and jL are the total current density and the limiting
current density, respectively. The current densities are normalized
to the geometrical surface area of the Pt surface. The durability
test was performed by applying the square potential wave between 0.6
and 1.0 V at 0.17 Hz in 0.1 M HClO4 saturated with Ar.

For the IR measurement of adsorbed CO, the sample was immersed
in 0.1 M HClO4 saturated with CO at 0.1 V for 20 min and
then pressed onto a CaF2 prism. The IRAS electrochemical
cell was attached to a Fourier-transform IR spectrometer (FT-IR 6600;
JASCO). The 32 spectra were accumulated with 4 cm–1 resolution.

SXRD measurement was performed with a multiaxis
diffractometer
at BL13XU (SPring-8).42 The X-ray energy
used was 20 keV. Integrated intensities were measured by rocking scans
and then corrected for Lorentz and area factors. A hexagonal surface
coordinate system was used for the Pt(111) crystal in which the reciprocal
wave vector is Q = Ha* + Kb* + Lc*, where a* = b* = 4π/√3a, c* = 2π/√6a, a = 0.2775
nm, and L is along the direction normal to the surface.
Structure refinements were conducted using the least-squares method
with the ANA-ROD program.43
