We
have used the density functional theory within the plane-wave
framework to understand the reconstruction of most stable (110) chalcopyrite
surfaces. Reconstructions of the polar surfaces are proposed, and
three different possible nonpolar terminations for the (110) surface,
namely, I, II, and III, are investigated. A detailed discussion on
stabilities of all three surface terminations is carried out. It is
generally observed that the (110) chalcopyrite surfaces encounter
significant reconstruction in which the metal Fe and Cu cations in
the first atomic layer considerably move downward to the surface,
while the surface S anions migrate slightly outward toward the surface.
We also investigated the adsorption of the CO2 molecule
on the three terminations for the (110) surface by exploring various
adsorption sites and configurations using density functional theory
calculations, in which long-range dispersion interactions are taken
into consideration. We show that the CO2 molecule is adsorbed
and activated, while spontaneous dissociation of the CO2 molecule is also observed on the (110) surfaces. Structural change
from a neutral linear molecule to a negatively charged (CO2–δ)
slightly or considerably bent species with stretched C–O bond
distances are highlighted for description of the activation of the
CO2 molecule. The results address the potential catalytic
activity of the (110) chalcopyrite toward the reduction and conversion
of CO2 to the organic molecule, which is appropriate to
the production of liquid fuels.

1 Introduction
Transition-metal
sulfides are the main class of Earth materials
with an interesting variety of structure types1 that have been technologically familiarized for different advanced
functional material applications. Chalcopyrite (CuFeS2)
as one of these structure types reveals a host of industrially applicable
electronic, magnetic, and catalytic properties. Chalcopyrite is known
as a common mineral of noticeable economic applicability that is commercially
the main source of copper, accounting for the majority of copper reserves
in the world.2

Structurally, in chalcopyrite,
each anion (sulfur atom) is bonded
to four cations (two copper atoms and iron atoms), forming a tetrahedra.3 Chalcopyrite is known as an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) semiconductor material with spins on any two iron atoms bonded
to a common sulfur atom are opposed and directed along the c axis3 (Figure 1). The magnetic and electrical properties
of chalcopyrite are still not completely known today. The electrical,
structural, and in particular the band gap properties of chalcopyrite
have made it as an interesting compound in a range of semiconductor
applications such as optical devices,4 photodiodes,5 spintronic devices,6 and thin-film intermediate-band solar cells.7

Figure 1 Schematic
of the CuFeS2 bulk structure. Red, blue, and
yellow spheres represent the Cu, Fe, and S atoms, respectively. The
S atoms are repeated in the edges because of the periodic boundary
conditions.

Because the properties of nanostructures
deviate considerably from
their bulk complement, a comprehensive understanding at the molecular
level is required to design functional devices. Significant efforts
have been performed toward understanding the chemistry and physics
of chalcopyrite, and as a result of these studies, a variety of interesting
properties have been discovered.8−16 It is well understood that the catalytic properties are intensely
affected by the surface structures. The connection between atomic-scale
properties and the macroscopic functionality is an effective factor
to modify catalytic surfaces,17 and the
first step is the adsorption of molecules on a catalyst surface through
their activation and conversion.

A significant number of theoretical
investigations were performed
for exploring the capability of different CuFeS2 surfaces
on the adsorption of molecules.8−14 Stirling et al.,14 for example, analyzed
the adsorption of H2O on the (100) surface using the density
functional theory (DFT) and plane wave basis set, and the strongest
chemisorption energy obtained was almost −54 kJ/mol. In a similar
study,13 they studied the molecular adsorption
of H2S on the (100) surface, and it was presented that
the adsorption is favorable with an adsorption energy of almost −46
kJ/mol. In addition, the H2O adsorption on the (001) surface
was studied by de Lima et al.15 and they
stated that the water adsorption on the iron atom is the preferred
mechanism with an adsorption energy of almost −95 kJ/mol. They
also studied the adsorption of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid
on the relaxed CuFeS2 (001) surface.16 Other surfaces such as (111), (101), (110), and (112) were
introduced as relevant surfaces for chalcopyrite and similar structures;3,18−20 however, the (110) surface was found to be the most
stable nonpolar surface.21−23 Natarajan et al. studied the
chemical and flotation behavior of chalcopyrite in the presence of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans for the selective removal
of pyrite from chalcopyrite for the economic extraction of valuable
copper. Recently, Mikhlin et al.24 have
studied possible configurations arising at CuFeS2(110)
and (012) surfaces because of the removal of adjacent Fe atoms in
the top layers by applying DFT calculations and also performed X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy studies of the chalcopyrite samples slightly
oxidized in water.25

Carbon dioxide
is known as the main source of the current climate
changes.26 The adverse influence of greenhouse
gas emissions could be alleviated by CO2 utilization. The
synthesis product chemicals from CO2 are not only a promising
substitute to conventional fossil fuels but also it could improve
the current technologies of carbon capture, sequestration, and storage.27 A considerable number of efforts have been performed
so far to realize the efficient ways of reducing CO2 and
converting it into organic molecules, which are the origins of fuel
and chemical feedstocks.27,28 The adsorption, activation,
and conversion of CO2 have been widely studied on metal–organic
frameworks,29−32 transition-metal complexes,33,34 and metal-oxide surfaces.35−40 For example, based on the previously performed theoretical studies,
CO2 adsorbs on FeS(001), FeS(011), and FeS(111) surfaces
with an energy of −19.3, −0.73, and −83.9 (kJ/mol),
respectively. CO2 adsorbs exothermally with a binding energy
of −71.4, −76, and −93.2 (kJ/mol) on CuO(111),
CuO(1̅11), and CuO(011) surfaces, respectively. The adsorption
energy of CO2 on graphene is calculated in a range of 25–30
(kJ/mol) in the physisorption regime. In addition, CO adsorption and
oxidation on Fe3O4 and Fe4C surfaces
are studied, and the results show that the adsorbed CO is partially
negatively charged, indicating the improved electron transfer from
the surfaces to CO, and the more the electron transfer, the stronger
the CO activation.41−43 Besides, the studies accomplished so far, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no published studies of the adsorption,
activation, and conversion of CO2 on the chalcopyrite surfaces.

In the present study, the reactivity of the (110) chalcopyrite
surface as the most stable surface appearing in the CuFeS2 has been investigated extensively toward the adsorption and activation
of CO2 using DFT to realize the factors that have a great
influence on the catalytic activity. To do this, first, a detailed
first-principles-based study of different terminations of CuFeS2(110) surfaces has been provided. The reconstruction and stability
of the surfaces has been discussed by analyzing their structure properties
and surface energies. Second, we have studied the CO2 adsorption
and activation on the terminated CuFeS2(110) surfaces by
interpreting the structural of different cases of adsorption. Different
adsorption sites on the surfaces have been explored, aiming to contribute
to understand the role of chalcopyrite for CO2 adsorption
and activation at a molecular level. Our results show that different
terminated (110) surfaces can activate the CO2 molecule.
In addition, the results show the subsequent dissociation of the molecule
to form CO and O species, which provide useful information in the
expansion of more well-organized CuFeS2 catalysts with
reactive surfaces.

2 Computational Methodology
Spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations have been carried out
using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a plane-wave
basis set.44−47 The DFT + U(48) methodology
with the generalized gradient approximation using the exchange–correlation
functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof49,50 and the formalism of Dudarev et al.48 has been employed to capture the strong correlation effect of 3d
electrons that are required for a more accurate description of the
transition metals of Cu and Fe in chalcopyrite.51,52

Chalcopyrite crystalizes in the tetragonal group with the
space
group I4̅2d (D2d12).51−53 The lattice constants determined by the X-ray diffraction experiment
was found to be a = b = 5.28954 (5.28655) Å
and c = 10.42354 (10.41055) Å. In our previous study,52 temperature-dependent properties (structure, mechanics, and thermodynamics)
of magnetic CuFeS2 were evaluated from first-principles
calculations. The Hubbard correction term (i.e., the Ueff value)48 was carefully
chosen for the localized 3d electrons of Cu and Fe, where Ueff is the difference between the Coulomb U and exchange J parameters. Calculations
including a Hubbard term for Fe atoms were executed with Ueff in intervals of 1 eV up to 9 eV with a constant Hubbard
term for Cu atoms. Calculations with a different Hubbard term for
Cu atoms did not have any significant effect on the relative energies
of the considered states and the atomic populations. Different magnetic
states of the AFM and FM phases for the supercells were analyzed,
and the spin configurations corresponding to the AFM phases were initially
assigned to the Fe atoms, as the most stable spin arrangement, in
the conventional supercells, as visualized using VESTA56 and shown in Figure 1. A conjugate gradient scheme was applied
with the residual interatomic forces of 0.01 eV/Å acting on the
atoms, and a self-consistent field convergence criterion better than
10–6 eV per unit cell was required. A Fermi smearing
of 0.01 was considered in order to induce the total energy to absolute
zero more accurately.57 A plane-wave cutoff
energy of 550 eV and a 4 × 4 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack46k-point mesh for the Brillouin
zone sampling of a 1 × 1 × 1 unit-cell of CuFeS2 were employed. It was suggested that the DFT + U methodology with the Ueff value of 5
eV is the most robust methodology to analyze the CuFeS2 structure, which provides the best match to the experimental geometric
properties, magnetic moment, and band gap values of CuFeS2.52

In the present study, the DFT
calculations have been performed
with the same accuracy parameters applied in the previous study52 and with the same value of plane-wave cutoff
energy; however, the number of k-points has been
adjusted related to the unit cell size. We have investigated different
possible nonpolar terminations of CuFeS2(110). The slab
modeled in the present work has lattice parameters as a = 10.418 Å and b = 7.443 Å. We tested
different vacuum thicknesses and relaxed layer numbers to achieve
the convergence within 1 meV per atom. Then, two layers of atoms at
the base of the system were fixed with the same positions as their
relaxed bulk positions. The surface were represented by one layer
of atoms above these two layers and were permitted to move freely
during the optimization. In addition, the vacuum region above the
surface was at least 10 Å, which the results show that it is
large enough to escape the interactions between the periodic slabs.
The (1 × 1) surface cells consisting of 12 Cu, 12 Fe, and 24
S atoms have been sampled with a 3 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack46k-point mesh.

The surface
energy of the relax slab has been calculated by considering
both calculations of the relaxed and unrelaxed surfaces.37,40 The top and bottom atomic layers of the surface are not the same
after relaxation, and therefore it is required to take the unrelaxed
surface energy (γu) into consideration to calculate
the final surface energy of the relaxed surface. The unrelaxed surface
energy is the surface energy before any surface optimization and is
calculated as 1  where Eslab,u is
the energy of the unrelaxed slab; nEbulk is the energy of an equal number of bulk atoms; and A is the surface area of one side of the slab. We calculated the relaxed
surface energy (γr) from the total energy of the
relaxed slab as follows 2  where Eslab,r is
the energy of the relaxed slab.

The adsorption energy of CO2 molecule has been calculated
by taking van der Waals interactions into account, which is crucial
for the precise description of the interaction between CO2 and a surface,37,40 where the correction according
to the Grimme method58 for the long-range
dispersion interactions (DFT-D2) has been applied. We have repeated
few calculations to see the effect of dipole correction scheme; however,
the results have shown that the difference in energy with and without
the dipole correction here is less than 0.03 kJ/mol, which is not
significant.

The interactions of the CO2 adsorbate
with the (110)
CuFeS2 surface slab have been modeled under conditions
in which the atoms of the adsorbate and the first atomic layer of
the slab have been allowed to relax without any constraint until residual
forces on all atoms reached 0.01 eV/Å. In order to avoid periodic
interactions between neighboring CO2 molecules, the CO2 adsorption has been calculated on a (1 × 2) supercell
consisting of 24 Cu, 24 Fe, and 48 S atoms which has been sampled
with a 5 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack46k-point mesh. Symmetry constraints have
been excluded in the structural optimization; in particular, the CO2 molecule can freely move in all directions and reorient until
reaching the minimum energy adsorption structure. The isolated CO2 molecule was also modeled in the center of a broken symmetry
cell with lattice constants of 20 Å and was sampled by the γ-point
of the Brillouin zone with the same accuracy parameters described
for the surfaces.

The adsorption energy per molecule has been
calculated as follows 3  where Esurf+mol is the total energy of
the adsorbate–substrate system; Esurf is the energy of the surface slab; and Emol is the energy of the isolated CO2 molecule. Within this
definition, the negative and positive values
of adsorption energy would indicate an exothermic and endothermic
process, respectively.

In order to elucidate the electronic
properties and quantify the
charge transfer between the surfaces and CO2 molecule,
a Bader charge analysis has been executed using the code developed
by Henkelman and co-workers.59,60

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 CuFeS2(110)
Surface
Tasker61 proposed a very
simple model for surface stability
of the ionic covalent compound by considering ionic crystal surfaces
as stacks of planes, where three possibilities (type I, II, and III)
can exist. In the type I surface, each plane has an overall zero charge
because of the stoichiometric ratio of anions and cations that makes
the surface nonpolar. Type II surfaces consist of charged layers but
without a perpendicular charge because of stacking sequence, while
type III surfaces have charged with the perpendicular dipole moment
that causes the divergence of the surface energy with the size of
the slab. According to Tasker,61 in type
I and II surfaces, the reconstruction of the surface is not needed
because there is no net dipole perpendicular to the surface in the
repeat unit. This causes the existence of these kinds of surfaces
in nature with just small relaxation and reconstruction; however,
type III surfaces require significant reconstruction in order to disperse
the net charge. It is worth nothing that some surfaces of type I or
II can also reconstruct considerably because of the important covalent
character of the chalcopyrite. The reconstruction of (001), (100),
(111), (112), (101), and (110) chalcopyrite surfaces was analyzed
using DFT calculations within the plane-wave framework by de Oliveira
et al.59 In their study, only one termination
for the (110) surface was introduced, while, in the present study,
we investigate the (110) surface in detail, and three different possible
terminations for the (110) surface have been obtained. In this section,
these three possible terminations for the (110) surface (i.e., (110)_I,
(110)_II, and (110)_III) and their surface energies have been presented.
All the relaxed and unrelaxed structure of these three (110) surfaces
are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Unrelaxed and relaxed nonpolar (110) surfaces: (a)-(d) (110)_I,
(e)-(h) (110)_II, and (i)-(l) (110)_III. Left panels show the side
view of the (110) surface, while the top view of the (110) surface
is shown in the right panels. Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent
Cu, Fe, and S atoms, respectively. The S atoms are repeated in the
edges because of the periodic boundary conditions.

The unrelaxed (110) surface is a stepped surface with atomic
layers
composed by sulfur–metal–sulfur chains, as illustrated
in Figure 2. The (110)_I
and (110)_III CuFeS2 surfaces do not reconstruct with the
first atomic layer consisting of four sulfur, two iron, and two copper
atoms, as shown in Figure 2a,b,i,j, respectively. In the present study, one reconstruction
has been obtained for the CuFeS2(110) surface, named the
(110)_II surface. In the reconstructed (110)_II CuFeS2 surface,
half of the ions with the same charge from the first surface layer
at the top of the repeated unit are removed and transferred to the
bottom of the simulation slab. As a result, the surface obtained is
partially vacant either in cations or onions so that the first atomic
layer comprises two sulfur, one iron, and one copper atoms, as shown
in Figure 2e,f. This
configuration guarantees that the surface does not generate an electrical
field within the crystal, and therefore the potential felt at each
ion site reaches the constant bulk value.

After the relaxations
of the two unreconstructed (110)_I and (110)_III
surfaces, the metal Fe and Cu cations in the first atomic layer considerably
relocate inward, while the surface S anions displace slightly outward
toward the surface, as shown in Figure 2c,d,k,l. This displacement behavior of the surface
atoms is consistent with the previously published computational studies.21,62 This relaxation improves the metal–metal (Cu–Fe, Cu–Cu,
and Fe–Fe) interactions in the first atomic layer and reduces
under-coordination of surface cations. The Fe–S bond decreases
from 2.280 to 2.261 Å, and the Cu–S bond decreases from
2.275 to around 2.225 Å. However, the relaxation of the reconstructed
(110)_II surface which includes the half-vacant plane in the first
atomic layer is found very unstable and there is no specific pattern
for the surface layers, as shown in Figure 2g,h.

Once the surface with no dipole
moment perpendicular to the surface
is generated and relaxed, the surface energy is calculated using the
relations 1 and 2. The
surface energy of 0.51 J/m2 is calculated for the two unreconstructed
(110)_I and _III surfaces, which is in good agreement with the value
of 0.58 J/m2 calculated by Chen et al.,21 while the slightly high value of 0.66 J/m2 surface
energy is calculated for the reconstructed (110)_II surface. Details
are given in Table 1.

3.2 CO2 Adsorption on (110) Chalcopyrite
Surfaces
We studied the CO2 adsorption by placing
the molecule, parallely and perpendicularly in different possible
directions and exploring all possible atomic sites on a (1 ×
2) supercell for all the surfaces obtained (Figure 3). During free relaxation, the CO2 molecule prefers to move away from the surface, whilst remaining
in a linear geometry, when placed parallel (x, y-directions) and perpendicular (z-direction)
on the top of the first atomic layer of the surface. CO2 is a linear molecule with two C=O bonds each with a length
of 1.176 Å and a O–O bond with a length of 2.352 Å.
To further investigate the interaction with atoms in the sublayer,
we placed the molecule parallely and perpendicularly close to different
atomic sites in the second atomic layer in different possible directions.
In contrast to the first atomic layer, the CO2 molecule
interacts with the surface and binds both exothermically and endothermally,
when placed parallely and perpendicularly to the surface in different
adsorption configurations of the sublayer. We surprisingly notified
the reactivity of the system with respect to CO2 dissociation
to form surface-bond CO and O species in a couple of configurations.
CO2 dissociation in all configurations is calculated to
be endothermic with the energies of almost 100 kJ/mol. In this section,
the results of the exothermal CO2 adsorption onto the surface
obtained are explained, and the results of the endothermal CO2 adsorption are provided in the Supporting Information as Figures S1–S3.

2) supercell of the relaxed (110) surfaces:
(a) (110)_I, (b) (110)_II, and (c) (110)_III. Red, blue, and yellow
spheres represent Cu, Fe, and S atoms, respectively. The S atoms are
repeated in the edges because of the periodic boundary conditions.

3.2.1 CuFeS2(110)_I Surface
The first set of CO2 adsorption calculations was performed
on the CuFeS2(110)_I surface. The strongest binding was
found, when we placed the molecule on top of the S atom in the subatomic
layer bonded with the Fesuf1 atom in the top layer (Figure 3a), perpendicular
to the surface in the z-direction (configuration
A). In this configuration, the Fesuf1 atom in the top layer
moves up by increasing the bonding with the S atom in the subatomic
layer from 2.289 to 2.338 Å, whereas only one of the oxygen atoms,
O1, of the molecule binds at a surface Fesuf1 site [d(Fesuf1–O1)
= 2.315 Å], as shown in Figure 4a. As a result, the CO2 molecule tilts relative
to the surface normal and retaining a nearly linear structure with
α(OCO) changing to 177.3°, whereas the C–O bonds
slightly stretched to 1.181 and 1.169 Å for the two oxygen atoms
O1 and O2, respectively. There is no other binding
between the molecule and the surface, and we note that in this configuration,
the CO2 molecule binds exothermally to the CuFeS2(110)_I surface with an adsorption energy of −22.8 kJ/mol.

configuration A and (b) configuration B in a (1 × 2) supercell.
Left panels illustrate the side views, while the top views are illustrated
in the right panels. Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent Cu, Fe,
and S surface atoms, respectively, while O and C atoms of the CO2 molecule are represented by green and black spheres, respectively.
Bond length values are in Angstroms.

The second strongest binding was found by placing the molecule
perpendicular to the surface in the z-direction in
the sublayer and in the middle of the space of the molecular ring,
which contains of Fesuf1, Cusuf2, Cusub1, and three S atoms (configuration B) (Figure 3a). We found that, similar to configuration
A, the Fesuf1 atom moves up while the bond length with
the S atom in the second atomic layer decreases from 2.289 to 2.238
Å. Similar to configuration A, only one of the oxygen atoms,
O1, of the molecule binds at a surface Fesuf1 site [d(Fesuf1–O1)
= 2.255 Å], as shown in Figure 4b. The CO2 molecule slightly bends to 177.4°,
and the C–O bonds slightly stretched to 1.188 and 1.166 Å
for the two oxygen atoms O1 and O2, respectively.
The CO2 adsorption to the CuFeS2(110)_I surface
is found to be −14.2 kJ/mol (exothermic adsorption).

The adsorption energies and representative parameters of these
two configuration are summarized in Table 2. It shows that the most stable adsorption
site is the Fe atom in the first atomic layer with an adsorption energy
of −22.8 and −14.2 kJ/mol.

Different atomic sites of the CuFeS2(110)_I surface
were explored for possible interaction with the CO2 molecule;
however, only the two above configuration found to be exothermal adsorption
energy, as presented above. The other configurations leading to endothermal
adsorption energy are provided in the Supporting Information as Figure S1a–j.

Moreover, we also
notice that for few initial placement of CO2 molecules,
the molecule dissociates into the CO and O species
on the CuFeS2(110)_I surface. In the first site (configuration
C), the bond between the two nearby Fesub1 and S atoms
in the first atomic layer breaks, and the dissociated O atom of the
CO2 molecule, O1, binds at the surface Fesuf1 site in the first atomic layer [d(Fesuf1–O1) = 1.983 Å] and the Fesub1 site in the second atomic layer [d(Fesub1–O1) = 2.059 Å] (Figure 5a). This dissociation of the CO2 molecule is found, when the molecule is placed in the sublayer perpendicular
to the surface in the z-direction and in an equal
distance of the Fesuf1 and Cusuf1 atoms in the
first atomic layer and close to the S atom made chain with both Fesuf1 and Cusuf1 atoms (Figure 3a). In addition, the bond between the two
adjacent Cusuf1 and S atoms in the first atomic layer breaks,
and the CO moiety with a bond length of 1.195 Å binds via the
C atom at the adjacent Cusuf1 and S atoms [d(Cusuf1–C) = 1.995 Å and d(S–C) = 1.719 Å].

CO molecule on the (110)_I surface in (a) configuration C and (b)
configuration D in a (1 × 2) supercell. Left panels illustrate
the side views, while the top views are illustrated in the right panels.
Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent Cu, Fe, and S surface atoms,
respectively, while O and C atoms of the CO2 and CO molecules
are represented by green and black spheres, respectively.

The second site (configuration D) leading to the CO2 molecule dissociation is, when the CO2 molecule is placed
in the sublayer perpendicular to the surface in the z-direction in an equal distance of the Fesuf1 and Cusuf2 atoms in the first atomic layer and close to the S atom
bonded with both Fesuf1 and Cusuf2 atoms (Figure 3a). In this configuration,
the dissociated O species, O1, binds at a site between
two adjacent surface Fesuf1 site [d(Fesuf1–O1) = 1.869 Å] and the S atom in
the second atomic layer [d(S–O1) = 1.594 Å] (Figure 5b). In addition, similar to configuration C, the bond between
the two adjacent Cusuf2 and S atoms in the first atomic
layer breaks, and the CO moiety binds via the C atom at the adjacent
Cusuf2 and S atoms [d(Cusuf2–C) = 1.986 Å and d(S–C) = 1.763
Å] with a bond length of 1.191 Å. These results for both
configuration C and configuration D show that spontaneous dissociation
of the CO2 molecule is possible over the CuFeS2(110)_I surface through interaction of the CO2 molecule
with sublayer surface atoms.

3.2.2 CuFeS2(110)_II Surface
As described earlier, there is no
specific pattern in the reconstructed
(110)_II surface (Figure 2g,h), while different possible sites of the surface are considered
to study the CO2 adsorption by placing the molecule on
these sites in different directions. The strongest binding is found
by placing the CO2 molecule perpendicular to the surface
in the z-direction in the sublayer in the middle
of the space of the molecular ring obtained, which contains the Fesuf1, Cusuf1, Fesuf2, and three S atoms
(configuration A) (Figure 3b). We note that the bonds between the S atom and two nearby
Fesuf2 in the first atomic layer and Fesub1 atoms
in the second atomic layer break, whereas the CO2 molecule
binds via the O2 atom at the Fesuf2 atom [d(Fesuf2–O2) = 2.008 Å]
and also binds via the C atom at the S atom [d(C–S)
= 1.771 Å] (Figure 6a). In addition, the other O atom, O1, binds at both Fesuf1 atom [d(Fesuf1–O1) = 2.198 Å] and Fesub1 [d(Fesub1–O1) = 2.076 Å]. As a result,
the molecule loses linearity [α(OCO) = 124.1°], and the
two C–O1 and C–O2 bonds are elongated
to 1.311 and 1.258 Å, respectively. In this configuration, the
CO2 molecule adsorbs exothermally with an adsorption energy
of −29.8 kJ/mol.

surface in (a)
configuration A and (b) configuration B in a (1 × 2) supercell.
Left panels illustrate the side views, while the top views are illustrated
in the right panels. Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent Cu, Fe,
and S surface atoms, respectively, while O and C atoms of the CO2 molecule are represented by green and black spheres, respectively.
Bond length values are in Angstroms.

The CO2 molecule also binds exothermally to the surface
in a different configuration (configuration B) with a binding energy
of −0.8 kJ/mol, when placed in the same site as configuration
A but parallel to the surface in the y-direction.
Here also, the bonds between the S atom and two Fesuf1 and
Fesuf2 atoms in the first atomic layer break, whereas the
CO2 molecule binds via the O1 atom at the Fesuf1 atom [d(Fesuf1–O1) = 2.006 Å] and also binds through the C atom at the
S atom [d(C–S) = 1.756 Å] (Figure 6b). In addition, the other
O atom, O2, binds at both Fesuf2 atom [d(Fesuf2–O2) = 2.055 Å] and Cusuf1 in the first atomic layer [d(Cusuf1–O2) = 2.165 Å]. As a result, the CO2 molecule
loses linearity to change α(OCO) to 124.1°, and the two
C–O1 and C–O2 bonds are lengthened
to 1.261 and 1.308 Å, respectively.

The adsorption energies
and representative parameters of these
two configuration are summarized in Table 3. It shows that the most stable adsorption
sites for the oxygen atoms are the Fe atom in the first and second
atomic layers, similar to the CuFeS2(110)_I, and the S
atom is the strongest bonding site for the C atom with an adsorption
energy of −29.8 and −0.8 kJ/mol.

Here, only the above
two configurations are found to be exothermal
adsorption energy on the CuFeS2(110)_II surface, and the
other configurations leading to endothermal adsorption energy are
provided in the Supporting Information as
Figure S2a–g.

Similar to the CuFeS2(110)_I
surface, the CO2 molecule dissociation to the CO and O
species was also observed
here on the CuFeS2(110)_II surface but only for one initial
configuration among different possible configurations investigated.
In this configuration, the bonds between two adjacent Fesuf2 and S atoms as well as Cusuf1 and its nearby S atom in
the first atomic layer break, when the CO2 molecule is
placed in the same site as configuration A but parallel to the surface
in the x-direction (configuration C). The CO moiety
binds via the C atom with the Fesuf2 atom [d(Fesuf2–C) = 2.159 Å] having a bond length
of 1.144 Å, in which the Fesuf2 atom bond with the
adjacent S atom is broken. In addition, the dissociated O species,
O1, binds at the bridge site between two adjacent surface
Cusuf1 [d(Cusuf1–O1) = 1.937 Å] and the S atoms in the first atomic layer
[d(S–O1) = 1.548 Å] (Figure 7).

in the right panel. Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent Cu, Fe,
and S surface atoms, respectively, while O and C atoms of the CO2 and CO molecules are represented by green and black spheres,
respectively.

3.2.3 CuFeS2(110)_III Surface
As described earlier, the relaxed
CuFeS2(110)_III surface
is a stable surface similar to the CuFeS2(110)_I surface
with the same energy surface of 0.51 J/m2. In this surface,
Fe and Cu atoms in the first atomic layer significantly displace inward
toward the bulk, while the surface S atoms relocate slightly outward
toward the surface (Figure 2k,l). We found similar adsorption sites on this surface, while
the CO2 molecule binds with different adsorption energy
values.

The CO2 molecule binds weakly in exothermic
fashion (−11.7 kJ/mol) on this surface on placing it parallel
to the surface in the y-direction in the sublayer
in the middle of the space of the molecular ring, consisting of the
Fesuf1, Cusuf1, Cusub1, and three
S atoms (configuration A) (Figure 3c). In this configuration, the molecule binds at a
surface Fesuf1 site through only one of its oxygen atoms,
O1, [d(Fesuf1–O1) = 2.257 Å], as shown in Figure 8a. We note that the Fesuf1 atom
moves slightly upward while the bonding with the S atom in the second
atomic layer decreases from 2.289 to 2.262 Å. As a result, the
CO2 molecule holding nearly its linear structure with α(OCO)
changing to 177.4° and skewed relative to the surface normal,
whereas the C–O bonds are slightly stretched to 1.188 and 1.166
Å for the two oxygen atoms O1 and O2, respectively.

Figure 8 CO2 molecule adsorbed on the (110)_III surface in (a)
configuration A and (b) configuration B in a (1 × 2) supercell.
Left panels illustrate the side views, while the top views are illustrated
in the right panels. Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent Cu, Fe,
and S surface atoms, respectively, while O and C atoms of the CO2 molecule are represented by green and black spheres, respectively.
Bond length values are in angstroms.

We found another exothermic adsorption configuration by placing
the molecule perpendicular to the surface in the z-direction on top of the S atom in the second atomic layer, which
has a bond with the Fesuf1 atom in the first atomic layer
(configuration B) (Figure 3a). We found that, similar to configuration A, the Fesuf1 atom moves up by increasing the bonding with the S atom
in the second atomic layer from 2.289 to 2.338 Å, whereas only
one of the oxygen atoms, O1, of the molecule binds at a
surface Fesuf1 site [d(Fesuf1–O1) = 2.319 Å], as shown in Figure 8b. We note that the CO2 molecule slightly loses the linearity and bends to 177.4°,
and the C–O bonds are slightly stretched to 1.181 and 1.169
Å for the two oxygen atoms O1 and O2, respectively.
The CO2 adsorbs exothermally to the surface with an adsorption
energy of −3.6 kJ/mol.

The adsorption energies and representative
parameters of these
two configuration are summarized in Table 4. Similar to the SuFeS2(110)_I
surface, it shows that the most stable adsorption site on the SuFeS2(110)_III surface is the Fe atom in the first atomic layer,
but the CO2 molecule adsorbs weaker on this surface than
the SuFeS2(110)_I surface with the adsorption energy of
−11.7 and −3.6 kJ/mol.

All other possible sites of the surface
were explored to study
the CO2 adsorption on the surface, and the other configuration
leading to endothermic adsorption energy is provided in the Supporting Information as Figure S3a–j.

Similar to the two surfaces described above, the CO2 molecule dissociation to the CO and O species was also found on
the CuFeS2(110)_III surface. The molecule dissociated when
we placed it perpendicular to the surface in the z-direction in the sublayer in the middle of the space of the molecular
ring, which contains the Cusuf4, Cusub1, Fesub2, and three S atoms (configuration C) (Figure 3c). We also note that the molecule
dissociates similar to the configuration C by placing it near the
Cusuf4 in the same molecular ring. In both configuration,
the bonds between the Fesub2 and the adjacent lower S atom
break and the dissociated O species, O1, binds at the Fesub2 [d(Fesub2–O1) = 1.940 Å] and S atoms [d(S–O1) = 1.573 Å] (Figure 9). The CO moiety with a bond length of 1.178 Å
binds through the C atom at the S atom in the first atomic layer [d(S–C) = 1.568 Å], which its bonds with two
adjacent Cu atoms are broken.

CO molecule on the
(110)_III surface in configuration C in a (1 × 2) supercell.
The left panel illustrates the side view, while the top view is illustrated
in the right panel. Red, blue, and yellow spheres represent Cu, Fe,
and S surface atoms, respectively, while O and C atoms of the CO2 and CO molecules are represented by green and black spheres,
respectively.

3.3 Electronic
Charge Transfer Analysis
Because the CO2 molecule
may receive electrons into its
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital to form a negatively charged bent
species (CO2–δ), we have quantified the electron transfer from the surface to the
CO2 molecule by performing Bader charge analysis on the
most exothermic CuFeS2–CO2 adsorption
configurations on all three surfaces (Figures 4a, 6a, and 8a). A clear charge transfer from the surfaces to
the adsorbed CO2 molecule has been observed calculated
through the difference of the charges on the CO2 molecule
[Δq(CO2)] in the adsorption configurations
to the isolated CO2 molecule. We note that the charge transfer
is more prominent in the most exothermic adsorption configuration
on the CuFeS2(110)_II (Figure 6a), where a net charge of 1.10 e– is transferred to the adsorbed CO2 molecule. In the most
exothermic adsorption configurations on the CuFeS2(110)_I
(Figure 4a) and CuFeS2(110)_III (Figure 8a); however, the CO2 molecule gained a net charge
of 0.08 and 0.10 e–, respectively, from the surface
species. We plotted the electronic charge density difference in order
to originate further insight into local charge rearrangement of the
surfaces because of the CO2 adsorption. The electronic
charge density difference can be obtained by subtracting from the
charge density of the total adsorbate–substrate system, the
sum of the charge densities of the CO2 molecule, and the
clean CuFeS2(110) surfaces, calculated using the same geometry
as the adsorbate–substrate system. Shown in Figure 10 are the electron density
difference isosurface plots, illustrating the electron redistribution
within the CO2–CuFeS2 systems. We observe
that the adsorbed CO2 molecule is activated with a net
negative charge and is localized on the oxygen atoms binded to the
surfaces. As noted, we observed a significant structural change in
the CO2 molecule as a result of its activation, changing
from a neutral linear molecule to a negatively charged (CO2–δ)
slightly or considerably bent species, with elongated C–O bond
distances (Tables 1, 2, and 3).

Figure 10 Electronic
density difference plot of CO2 adsorption
structures on (a) CuFeS2(110)_I, (b) CuFeS2(110)_II,
and (c) CuFeS2(110)_III surfaces in the most stable exothermic
configurations, showing charge transfer in the regions between the
CO2 and the atoms in the first atomic layer. The left panel
illustrates the side view, while the top view is illustrated in the
right panel. Orange contours indicate the electron density increases
by 0.02 electrons/Å3, and green contours indicate
the electron density decreases by 0.02 electrons/Å3.

4 Conclusions
We have used the DFT + U methodology to describe
CuFeS2 surface structures and presented the analyses of
the CO2 adsorption and activation on the CuFeS2(110) surfaces. Plane-wave density functional calculations have been
applied to study the reconstruction of the (110) CuFeS2 surfaces. Three possible stable surface terminations for the (110)
surface have been proposed, and reconstruction has been explained
in detail.

Among three different surface configurations, the
two terminations
are found to be more stable, and for these surface terminations, we
found that the most stable site for adsorption is the iron atom binded
to one of the oxygen atoms with an adsorption energy equal to ∼−22.8
and −11.7 kJ/mol, whereas the CO2 molecule holding
nearly its linear structure and skewed relative to the surface normal,
and the C–O bonds are elongated for the two oxygen atoms. However,
the other (110) surface exhibits stronger adsorption (∼−29.8
kJ/mol), and the most stable site for adsorption is the iron atom
binded to the oxygen atoms and the sulfur atom binded to the carbon
atom, whereas the molecule loses linearity, and the two C–O
bonds are also elongated. We also notice spontaneous dissociation
of the CO2 molecule into CO and O species on all the three
surfaces, where one of the oxygen atoms binds with two surface atoms
in the first and second atomic layer.

We note that the CO2 molecule accepts electrons into
its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital to form a negatively charged
species on the surfaces as confirmed by Bader charge analysis, and
the structure of the surface plays a significant role in the activation
of CO2. Elongation of the C–O bonds is observed
in the adsorbed molecule on these surfaces compared to the gas-phase
molecule, showing activation of the CO2 molecule over these
surfaces. Future work will include investigations of reaction pathways
for the CO2 conversion on the different surfaces of CuFeS2. Catalytic processes are extremely complex in nature because
of occurring in a multicomponent environment, and various environmental
parameters such as temperature, pressure, and electrode potential
could affect the process. However, DFT calculations at 0 K, as presented
in this paper, would provide mechanistic insight into CO2 activation on the (110) CuFeS2 surface, and this fundamental
understanding would still be relevant for applications at higher temperatures.
