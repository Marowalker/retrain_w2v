Collagen has long been one of the
top targets for biomimetic design
due to its superior structural and functional properties. Significant
progress has been achieved to construct self-assembling peptides to
mimic the fibrous nanostructure of native collagen, while it is still
very demanding to fabricate peptide assemblies that can recapitulate
both structural and biofunctional features of collagen. Herein, collagen-like
peptides have been synthesized to contain negatively charged amino
acids as the binding groups of lanthanide ions and the integrin-binding
motif GFOGER. The simultaneous inclusion of negatively charged amino
acids in the middle as well as at both terminals drives the peptides
to self-assemble to form well-ordered nanofibers with distinct periodic
banding patterns specifically mediated by lanthanide ions. The aggregation
tendency and the morphology of the final assembled materials for the
peptides are modulated in a pH-cooperative manner, which well mimics
the pH-dependent fibrillogenesis of Type I collagen. The utilization
of lanthanide ions in the system not only offers a convenient external
stimulus but also functionalizes assembled materials with excellent
luminescent features. Most notably, the lanthanide-triggered peptide
assembled nanomaterials possess good cell adhesion properties, which
resemble the biological function of collagen. This peptide-Ln3+ system provides a facile and potent strategy to generate
nanofibers that mimic both the structural and functional properties
of natural collagen. These novel pH-responsive, luminescent, and biofunctional
collagen mimetic nanofibers open fascinating opportunities in the
development of improved functional biomaterials in tissue engineering,
drug delivery, and medical diagnostics.

==== Body
Introduction
Collagen is a ubiquitous
structural protein in mammals, and plays
essential roles in the formation of tendon, bone, skin, cartilage,
and ligaments.1 Twenty-eight types of collagens
have been discovered, and they possess a common triple helix structure.2 The tight packing of the three α chains
can only tolerate the least bulkiest Gly as every third residue, leading
to the repetitive (Gly-X–Y)n amino acid sequence pattern.3 The residues at the X and Y positions are frequently occupied by proline (Pro) and hydroxyproline
(Hyp), respectively, with the latter enhancing the triple helix stability
through water-bridged hydrogen bonds.4 The
signature triple helices assemble to form collagen fibrils, which
provide a structural scaffold for the human body.5 The triple helix structure is believed to be essential
in collagen fibrillogenesis, and it is observed that the collagen
fibrillogenesis boosts the stability of the triple helix.6

Collagen plays critical roles not only
as structural components
but also as functional molecules.7 Collagen
fibers are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration,
as well as extracellular matrix remodeling, through the interaction
with a plethora of cell surface receptors and matrix biomolecules.8,9 A number of cell-binding motifs, such as GFOGER, have been determined
in collagen.10−12 The specific binding of integrin with these bioactive
motifs in collagen can activate cytoplasmic intracellular signaling
pathways, which are considered to be critical for various biological
processes such as embryogenesis, homeostasis, and tissue remodeling.13−16 Furthermore, collagen fibers have displayed broad biomedical applications,
such as skin substitute and facial soft tissue augmentation.17,18 However, the utilization of animal collagen raises growing concerns
due to the transmission of pathogens.19 The development of biomimetic strategies to achieve superior structural
and functional properties of collagen has therefore received intensive
attention.20

A variety of triple-helical
peptides have been constructed to form
a plethora of well-ordered supramolecular structures such as fibers,
microtubes, hollow spheres, nanodisks, nanosheets, nanoropes, nanowires,
meshes, and microflorettes.21−32 Most notably, extensive efforts have been contributed to the generation
of fibrous nanomaterials, which best mimic the natural form of the
most abundant type I collagen. Various approaches using modified cysteine-knots,
π–π stacking, π-cation interactions, metal–ligand
interactions, metal-mediated tandem coassembly, hydrophobic interactions,
electrostatic interactions, triple-helical nucleation, peptide tessellation,
and amphiphilic peptides have thus far been successfully established
to achieve collagen fibers.33−44 Among these collagen mimetic peptides, a few of their assembled
nanomaterials display specific functions for nanowires, three-dimensional
cell culture, platelet activation, and hydrolytic catalysis.27,33,35,45−47 Particularly, a collagen mimetic peptide amphiphile
containing the integrin-binding motif has recently been synthesized,
which is capable of self-assembling to form nanofibers and to promote
cell adhesion.41 Up to now, significant
progress has been made to fabricate self-assembling peptides to mimic
the complex structure of native collagen, while it remains much more
demanding to build collagen mimetic fibers with both structural and
biofunctional features.21,41

We have recently
established a collagen mimic peptide-lanthanide
ion platform to form nanoropes via head-to-tail self-assembly through
the specific binding between the terminal aspartic acids of the peptides
and lanthanide ions.22 We herein report
the design of novel collagen mimetic peptides with negatively charged
amino acids in the middle in addition to those at N- and C-terminals,
which facilitate both radial and head-to-tail self-assembly of the
peptides, leading to the formation of exquisite nanofibers characteristic
of native collagen. Moreover, the inclusion of the integrin-binding
motif GFOGER in these peptides empowers them with excellent cell adhesion
features. The peptide-lanthanide system provides a robust tool to
generate luminescent biofunctional collagen mimetic nanofibers. The
synthesis of peptide-based nanomaterials, which well mimic both the
structure and biological function of native collagen, has great potential
in tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and medical diagnostics.

Results
and Discussion
Design of Collagen Mimetic Peptides
We herein report
the design of three collagen-like peptides that can self-assemble
to form distinct fibers triggered by the addition of lanthanide ions.
The self-assembling properties of the designed peptides CMP1 (with
amino acid sequence DD(GPP)5GDP(GPP)6DD), CMP2
(with amino acid sequence DD(GPO)3GDOGPOGFOGERGPOGDO(GPO)3DD), and CMP3 (with amino acid sequence EE(GPO)3GEOGPOGFOGERGPOGEO(GPO)3EE) rely on the inclusion of negatively
charged amino acids in the middle as well as at the terminals as the
binding ligands for Ln3+ ions (Table S1). We have recently discovered that a triple-helical peptide
DcolD with the amino acid sequence DD(PPG)12DD can be specifically
mediated by Ln3+ ions to self-assemble to form banded helical
nanoropes.22 Aspartic acids have been demonstrated
as excellent binding units for lanthanide ions, and their presence
at both N- and C-terminals can mediate the head-to-tail self-assembly.22

We propose that the incorporation of extra
aspartic acid in the middle of peptide CMP1 can facilitate the radial
self-assembly, while the terminal aspartic acids promote the head-to-tail
assembly, which will together drive the formation of nanofibers (Figure 1a,b). The (GPP)5 and (GPP)6 sequences besides GDP are included
to reinforce high stability of the triple helix. The second peptide
CMP2 adds the integrin-binding motif GFOGER, which has been demonstrated
to functionalize triple-helical peptides with cell adhesion properties.12,41 The GPO triplet is the most stable sequence for triple helix conformation
and is used to enhance the triple helix stability of peptide CMP2.48 The third peptide CMP3 replaces all aspartic
acids of peptide CMP2 with glutamic acids to evaluate if glutamic
acids share the same capability as aspartic acids to mediate the assembly.
The three peptides are designed to self-assemble under the mediation
of lanthanide ions to form nanofibers with structural and biofunctional
features characteristic of native collagen.

and CMP3) containing Ln3+-binding ligands in the center

head-to-tail and radial assembly of the peptides triggered by lanthanide
ions. (c) Photographs show the visual changes of the three peptide
solutions before and after the addition of Ln3+ ions and
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Triple Helix Stability of Collagen Mimetic Peptides
The
folding of collagen mimetic peptides into a triple helix structure
is considered as a prerequisite to allow proper positioning of its
carboxyl groups for binding with Ln3+ ions. Circular dichroism
(CD) spectra of peptide CMP1 showed a characteristic peak at 225 nm,
demonstrating the formation of triple helix structure (Figure S1). Thermal transition studies indicated
that the melting temperature (Tm) of peptide
CMP1 was 37 °C at pH 7.0 in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (Figure S1b,c). Similarly, CD spectra of peptides
CMP2 and CMP3 displayed a typical peak of the triple helix structure
at pH 7.0 (Figures S2 and 3). Thermal transition
studies revealed that the melting temperature of peptide CMP2 and
CMP3 was 43 and 48 °C, respectively. These results demonstrated
that all of the three peptides possessed the unique triple helix structure
of collagen.

Lanthanide-Mediated Assembly of Collagen
Mimetic Peptides
The ability of lanthanide ions to initiate
the assembly of peptide
CMP1 was monitored in 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0 at 25 °C (Figure 1c). The peptide solution
was transparent, and it immediately turned turbid after the addition
of any type of trivalent lanthanide ions (La3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+, and Tm3+) (Figure 1c). In contrast, when the monovalent metal
ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+) or divalent metal ions (Zn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, and
Mn2+) were added to the peptide solution, it remained clear
(data not shown). These results demonstrated that the self-assembly
of peptide CMP1 was mainly specific to lanthanide ions. The reversibility
of the peptide assembly was further examined by the addition of a
metal chelator (Figure 1c). When EDTA (2.85 mM) was added to the turbid peptide CMP1-Ln3+ solution, it immediately became transparent, suggesting
that EDTA could efficiently reverse the Ln3+-mediated assembly
of peptide CMP1 (Figure 1c). These results revealed that the assembly of peptide CMP1 was
conveniently regulated by lanthanide ions.

Similar to peptide
CMP1, CMP2 and CMP3 were capable of self-assembling specifically under
the trigger of lanthanide ions (Figure 1c). The addition of any type of trivalent lanthanide
ions (La3+, Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+, and Tm3+) turned the
solution of CMP2 and CMP3 cloudy, while the turbid solutions of CMP2-Ln3+ or CMP3-Ln3+ immediately became clear after the
addition of EDTA (Figure 1c). Meanwhile, the peptide solutions of CMP2 and CMP3 remained
transparent after the addition of monovalent metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+) or divalent
metal ions (Zn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, and Mn2+)
(data not shown). These results demonstrated that lanthanide ions
played the same critical role in the assembly of all of the three
collagen-like peptides.

Morphology of Self-assembled Peptide CMP1-Lanthanide
Nanomaterials
The morphology of the assembled nanomaterials
of peptide CMP1 with
different lanthanide ions was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Figure 2). The
SEM image of the CMP1-La3+ aggregates at a molar ratio
of 1:2 showed long and thin nanofibers (Figure 2a). Similarly, the peptide assemblies initiated
by other lanthanide ions (Eu3+, Tb3+, and Dy3+) all showed cross-linked nanofibrous supramolecular structures
(Figure 2b–d).
The assembly of CMP1-La3+ was then examined under different
conditions, such as the molar ratio of CMP1/La3+ and incubation
time (Figure S4–5). A variety of
relative concentrations of CMP1 and La3+ (1:1, 1:2, and
1:4) all resulted in well-ordered nanofibers (Figure S4). Nanofibers were also obtained using different
incubation times (12, 24, and 48 h) for the CMP1-La3+ mixture
(Figure S5). All of these results demonstrated
that the CMP1-Ln3+ mixtures steadily led to delicate fibrous
nanostructures.

of peptide CMP1 with specified lanthanide ions La3+ (a),
Eu3+ (b), Tb3+ (c), and Dy3+ (d)
at a molar ratio of 1:2. Scale bar = 1.0 μm. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of peptide CMP1 with La3+ ions
at a molar ratio of 1:2 (e, f). Peptide CMP1-lanthanide nanomaterials
were prepared in 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to further
characterize the structural details of the CMP1-La3+ assemblies
at a nanometer scale (Figure 2e,f). TEM visualization of the La3+-triggered peptide
assemblies showed an interconnected three-dimensional fibrous network
(Figure 2e). Furthermore,
the assemblies displayed distinct, regularly spaced bands, demonstrating
the success of our design to be capable of imitating the characteristic
banding feature of native collagen (Figure 2f). More notably, the distance between the
banding gaps for the peptide-La3+ aggregates was estimated
to be ∼10 nm (Figure 2f). This was in perfect match with the calculated length of
peptide CMP1, suggesting that lanthanide ions triggered linear as
well as radial assembly of the peptide (Figure 1b). These results convincingly demonstrated
that the CMP1-La3+ system provided an excellent biomimetic
approach to achieve the periodic banding of native collagen at the
nanometer scale.

pH-Dependent CMP1-La3+ Assembly
The pH-responsive
properties of the CMP1-La3+ system were then investigated
under different pH conditions by turbidity and SEM (Figure 3). When the pH of the mixture
was adjusted from 7.0 to 3.5, a decreased amount of white aggregates
was clearly observed, while the further decrease of pH to 3.2 and
lower led to no visible aggregates (Figure 3). It demonstrated that the La3+-triggered assembly of peptide CMP1 was significantly modulated by
pH, which likely resulted from the pH-sensitive binding capability
of aspartic acids and lanthanide ions. This constructed peptide-Ln3+ system well mimics the pH-dependent fibrillogenesis of Type
I collagen, which self-assembles to form fibrils at pH 7.0, but not
at acidic pH 2.5.49

Figure 3 pH dependence of the
peptide CMP1-La3+ assembly. Photographs
show the changes of the peptide solution after the addition of La3+ ions under various pH conditions (pH 7.0–2.6). SEM
images of the CMP1-La3+ assembled materials prepared at
different pH values: pH 7.0 (a), pH 6.4 (b), pH 6.0 (c), pH 5.0 (d),
pH 4.0 (e), and pH 3.5 (f). The molar ratio of CMP1/La3+ is 1:2. Scale bar = 1.0 μm.

The morphology of the assembled materials at different pH values
was characterized by SEM (Figure 3a–f). When the peptide solution became more
acidic, the long and thin nanofibers became disrupted and less ordered.
When the pH was decreased to 4.0 and 3.5, the peptide CMP1-La3+ aggregates turned to be very poorly organized, and the brick-like
rather than fibrous suprastructures became dominant. These results
indicated that pH not only controlled the extent of the peptide CMP1-Ln3+ assembly but also the morphology of the final assembled
materials. The assembled materials of native Type I collagen displayed
nice banded fibrils at pH 7.0, but much less ordered suprastructure
at acidic pH, demonstrating the superior capability of this peptide-Ln3+ system to recapitulate the pH-responsive feature of native
collagen.49

The reversibility of
the pH-regulated peptide CMP1-Ln3+ assembly was further
examined (Figure S6). The CMP1-La3+ mixture remained clear at pH 2.6, and
it immediately became turbid after the pH of the solution was adjusted
to pH 7.0 (Figure S6a,b). The generated
aggregates appeared to contain nanofibrous structures as revealed
by SEM visualization (Figure S6b). When
the pH of the turbid CMP1-La3+ solution was readapted from
7.0 to 2.6, the aggregates got dissolved and the solution turned clear
(Figure S6c,d). This suggested that the
peptide CMP1-Ln3+ assembly was reversibly, finely regulated
by pH.

Photoluminescence of the CMP1-Lanthanide Nanomaterials
Lanthanide ions may endow the peptide assemblies with extraordinary
luminescent properties. Solid-state fluorescence was applied to characterize
the photoluminescent features of the CMP1-Ln3+ assembled
nanofibers (Figure 4). The fluorescence emission spectrum of the CMP1-Eu3+ nanomaterials was obtained at an excitation wavelength of 394 nm
and displayed characteristic peaks corresponding to the intra-4f65D0–7F0–2 transitions (Figure 4a). The observation of a strong line for 5D0–7F2 indicated that the CMP1-Eu3+ nanomaterials possessed good color purity, and the single
line for 5D0–7F0 suggested the uniform chemical environment for Eu3+.
The CMP1-Eu3+ assemblies were red-light emitters under
UV irradiation. Photoluminescent features of the CMP1-Tb3+, CMP1-Dy3+, and CMP1-Gd3+ assembled materials
were also characterized, and they behaved as pure green-light, yellow-light,
and blue-light emitters, respectively (Figure 4b–d). Lanthanide ions have been reported
to emit across the whole visible spectrum with high color purity.50 Our results indicated that the peptide-Ln3+ assembled nanofibers exhibit attractive luminescent features,
and their colors could be easily tuned by employing different types
of lanthanide ions.

of peptide
CMP1 with various lanthanide ions: Eu3+ (a), Tb3+ (b),
Dy3+ (c), and Gd3+ (d). The emission spectra
were measured at an excitation wavelength of 394, 370, 365, and 303
nm for Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, and Gd3+, respectively. The inset shows photographs of the peptide
CMP1-Ln3+ materials on a glass slide under a fluorescence
microscope.

Morphology of Peptide CMP2-Lanthanide
Nanomaterials
The morphology of the assembled nanomaterials
of peptide CMP2 with
lanthanide ion La3+ was evaluated by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 5). The SEM image
of the peptide CMP2-La3+ assemblies prepared in 50 mM HAc–NaAc
buffer, pH 5.0, showed cross-linked nanofibers (Figure 5a,b). TEM visualization of the CMP2-La3+ assemblies revealed an interconnected three-dimensional
fibrous framework (Figure 5c). Furthermore, the CMP2-La3+ assemblies showed
the same regularly spaced bands as the CMP1-La3+ assemblies,
demonstrating that the CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials recapitulated
the unique banding pattern of native collagen (Figure 5d). The consistency of the distance between
the banding gaps (∼10 nm) and the calculated length of the
triple helix formed by peptide CMP2, reconfirmed the hypothesis of
lanthanide-triggered linear as well as radial assembly of the peptide
(Figure 1b).

SEM images (a, b) and TEM images (c, d) of peptide CMP2 with lanthanide
ion La3+. Peptide CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials were
prepared in 50 mM HAc–NaAc buffer, pH 5.0.

The pH-responsive features of the CMP2-La3+ system were
then evaluated under different pH conditions (Figure S7). Similar to peptide CMP1, the CMP2-La3+ mixture formed white aggregates in the range of pH from 4.0 to 7.0,
while no visible aggregates were observed at pH 3.0 or lower. SEM
images of the CMP2-La3+ aggregates obtained at pH 6.0 and
7.0 showed fibrous nanostructures, while their SEM images produced
at pH 4.0 displayed short, brick-like nanostructures (Figure S7). These results demonstrated that pH
mediated the capability of the peptide CMP2-La3+ assembly
as well as the morphology of the final CMP2-La3+-assembled
materials.

Biofunction of Self-assembled Peptide CMP2-Lanthanide
Nanomaterials
The GFOGER motif within the triple-helical
domain of collagen has
been reported to recognize integrin receptors and mediate cell adhesion.12 The biofunction of peptide CMP2-La3+ assemblies was thus evaluated by the cell adhesion assay using HeLa
cells (Figure 6). HeLa
cells were cultured on the plate wells coated with heat-denatured
bovine serum albumin (BSA), collagen, and CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials
produced at four different pH conditions (pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0),
respectively. Cell adhesion to the native collagen substrate was taken
as the 100% reference level. The percentage of the cell adhesion to
BSA was 23%, indicating that HeLa cells barely bind to BSA substrates.
The percentages of the cell adhesion to CMP1-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 4.0, pH 5.0, pH 6.0, and pH 7.0 were
approximately 23%, 24%, 24% and 23%, respectively, demonstrating that
HeLa cells barely bind to CMP1-La3+ substrates.
In contrast, the percentages of the cell adhesion to CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 4.0, pH 5.0, pH 6.0, and pH 7.0 were
approximately 62%, 62%, 62% and 63%, respectively, demonstrating that
HeLa cells could efficiently attach onto the surfaces of CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials. Though the morphologies of CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials varied at different pH conditions, their cell adhesion
activities were almost the same, indicating that the bioactive GFOGER
motif played a determinant role for the CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials
to recognize and interact with the receptors on the cell membrane
surface.

Figure 6 Adhesion of HeLa cells as a function of surface composition: heat-denatured
BSA, calf-skin collagen, CMP1-1 (CMP1-La3+ nanomaterials
produced at pH 4.0), CMP1-2 (CMP1-La3+ nanomaterials produced
at pH 5.0), CMP1-3 (CMP1-La3+ nanomaterials
produced at pH 6.0), CMP1-4 (CMP1-La3+ nanomaterials produced
at pH 7.0), CMP2-1 (CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials produced at
pH 4.0), CMP2-2 (CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH
5.0), CMP2-3 (CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 6.0),
CMP2-4 (CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 7.0), CMP3-1
(CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 5.0), CMP3-2 (CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 6.0), and CMP3-3 (CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 7.0). Cell adhesion to collagen
was used as a 100% reference level.

Cell adhesion and spreading properties were further examined by
confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figures S8 and 7). The attached HeLa cells were fixed and stained for actin
stress fibers and nuclei with phalloidin–tetramethylrhodamine
isothiocyanate and Hoechst 33258 nuclear dye, respectively. The confocal
images indicated that the HeLa cells on the CMP1-La3+-coated substrates produced at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 maintained
the spherical shape, and the cytoskeletal structure was poorly developed
(Figure S8). In contrast, the confocal
images indicated that the HeLa cells on the CMP2-La3+-coated
substrates produced at pH 5.0 displayed a well-developed actin cytoskeletal
structure (Figure 7a). The extensive cell adhesion and spreading demonstrated that the
CMP2-La3+ nanofibers well mimic the cell interaction capability
of natural collagen. In addition, the actin cytoskeletal organization
remained the same in the cells seeded on CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials
produced at pH 4.0, 6.0, and 7.0, suggesting that the morphologies
of CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials did not affect the cell adhesion
and spreading properties (Figure 7b–d). The extensive cell spreading was likely
mediated by the integrin-cell adhesion process controlled by the GFOGER
motif. These results suggested that the CMP2-La3+ nanofibers
could assist cell adhesion and spreading.

CMP2-La3+ nanomaterials produced at different pH conditions:
pH 5.0 (a), pH 4.0 (b), pH 6.0 (c), and pH 7.0 (d). Cells were fixed
and stained for actin stress fibers (red) and nuclei (blue). The images
were recorded by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Morphology and Biofunction of Self-assembled Peptide CMP3-Lanthanide
Nanomaterials
The morphology of the assembled nanomaterials
of peptide CMP3 with lanthanide ion La3+ was investigated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 8). The
SEM image of the peptide CMP3-La3+ assemblies prepared
in 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, showed fibrous nanostructures (Figure 8a). TEM visualization
of the CMP3-La3+ assemblies revealed the characteristic
periodic bands of ∼10 nm (Figure 8b). These results demonstrated that peptide
CMP3 shared the same capability as CMP1 and CMP2 to facilitate the
head-to-tail as well as radial assembly triggered by lanthanide ions
(Figure 1b). The pH-responsive
features of the CMP3-La3+ system were then examined under
different pH conditions (Figure S9). The
CMP3-La3+ mixture formed white aggregates in the range
of pH from 5.0 to 7.0, while no visible aggregates were observed at
or below pH 4.0. SEM images of the CMP3-La3+ aggregates
obtained at pH 5.0 and 6.0 displayed much shorter segments (Figure S9). These results indicated that the
peptide CMP3-La3+ assembly was modulated by pH.

and function of self-assembled peptide CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials.

(c,d). Cells were fixed and stained for actin stress fibers (red)
and nuclei (blue).

The biofunction of peptide
CMP3-La3+ assemblies was
examined by the cell adhesion assay (Figure 6). The percentages of the cell adhesion to
CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials produced at pH 5.0, pH 6.0, and
pH 7.0 were approximately 66%, 67% and 71%, respectively, demonstrating
that HeLa cells could efficiently attach onto the surfaces of CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials (Figure 6). Cell adhesion and spreading features of CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials were further characterized by confocal fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 8c,d). The confocal images indicated that the HeLa cells on the CMP3-La3+-coated substrates produced at pH 7.0 displayed a well-pronounced
actin cytoskeletal structure (Figure 8c,d). Similar cell adhesion performance was observed
for the CMP3-La3+-coated substrates produced at pH 5.0
and 6.0 (Figure S10). The extensive cell
adhesion and spreading demonstrated that the CMP3-La3+ nanofibers
well recapitulate the cell interaction capability of native collagen.
These results indicated that both the CMP2-La3+ and CMP3-La3+ nanofibers facilitate cell adhesion and spreading.

Conclusions
Collagen has been a hot target for biomimetic design due to its
excellent structural and functional properties.21 A number of triple-helical peptide-based strategies such
as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions have been established
to generate collagen mimetic nanofibers.20 Though significant advances have been achieved to construct self-assembling
peptides to recapitulate the nanofibrous structure of native collagen,
there are far fewer reports to fabricate peptide assemblies that possess
both structural and biofunctional features of collagen.

We have
recently discovered that a collagen-like peptide DD(PPG)12DD can be initiated by lanthanide ions to form nanoropes.22 Herein, by introducing a central Asp in the
peptide CMP1 as an additional binding unit of lanthanide ions to trigger
radial assembly besides the head-to-tail assembly assisted by the
terminal aspartic acids, we have created exquisite fibrous nanomaterials
with distinct periodic banding patterns, which well mimic the hierarchical
structure of natural collagen. It agrees well with previous studies
that the morphology of divalent metal-triggered peptide assemblies
depends on the numbers and locations of metal-binding units.25,29,36 The successful Ln3+-triggered assembly of peptides, CMP2 and CMP3, demonstrates that
the simultaneous incorporation of negatively charged amino acids in
the middle as well as at N- and C-terminals of triple-helical peptides
provides a reliable and robust strategy to create collagen mimetic
nanofibers. Compared with glutamic acids, aspartic acids have shorter
side chains, which may result in better coordination with lanthanide
ions, leading to good fibrous nanostructures.

The assembly of
all of the three constructed collagen mimetic peptides
has been shown to be specifically mediated by lanthanide ions. The
utilization of lanthanide ions provides a convenient external stimulus
to ensure that the peptide self-assembly is an easily controlled and
well programmable process, and it also functionalizes collagen mimetic
materials with easily tunable photoluminescence. Due to the excellent
features such as line-like emission, long luminescence lifetime, and
high photochemical stability, lanthanide ions have been widely applied
as photoluminescent materials in cell imaging and medical diagnostics.50 The handy selection of different kinds of lanthanide
ions will greatly enhance the luminescent properties of the hybrid
peptide-Ln3+ nanomaterials.

Interestingly, this constructed
peptide-Ln3+ system
well mimics the pH-dependent fibrillogenesis of Type I collagen.49,51 The aggregation tendency and the morphology of final assembled materials
for the peptides and type I collagen are modulated in a similar pH-cooperative
manner. The sensitivity to environmental pH has been considered to
play an essential role in the collagen structure and function.49 This peptide-Ln3+ system provides
a facile approach to create peptide-based nanofibers that well recapitulate
pH-responsive features of native collagen. It probably results from
the pH-dependent binding behavior of negatively charged amino acids
and lanthanide ions. At a neutral pH, the deprotonated aspartic acids
or glutamic acids facilitate strong binding of Asp/Glu-Ln3+, leading to the generation of self-assembled nanomaterials. However,
at too acidic pH, the protonated amino acids become poor ligand for
Ln3+, which is unable to initiate the self-assembly of
the peptides.

Most notably, the lanthanide-triggered peptide
assembled nanomaterials
possess good cell adhesion properties characteristic of collagen.
The inclusion of integrin-binding motif GFOGER in triple-helical peptides
CMP2 and CMP3 enables these peptide assemblies to recognize and bind
with HeLa cells as shown by the cell adhesion assay. The presence
of charged amino acids Glu and Arg appears not to interfere in the
appropriate assembly of the peptides. The confocal images show extensive
cell adhesion and spreading on the surface of these peptide-La3+ substrates, demonstrating that the peptide-La3+ nanofibers well mimic the cell interaction properties of native
collagen. To conclude, triple-helical peptides supplemented with the
bioactive GFOGER motif and the simultaneous incorporation of negatively
charged amino acids in the middle as well as at the terminals provide
a convenient and potent approach to generate nanofibers that mimic
both structural and functional features of native collagen. These
novel pH-responsive, luminescent, and biofunctional collagen mimetic
nanofibers open fascinating opportunities in the development of improved
functional biomaterials in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and
medical diagnostics.

Experimental Section
Peptide Synthesis
Peptides CMP1 and CMP2 were obtained
from the Chinese Peptide Company (Hangzhou, China). Peptide CMP3 was
synthesized following the Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method at a 0.1
mmol scale. 2-Chlorotrityl chloride resin was used. Stepwise coupling
of amino acids was carried out according to a double coupling protocol
using diisopropylethylamme (6 eqiuv), Fmoc-amino acids (4 eqiuv),
and activator reagents (HBTU + HOBt 0.66 mmol/ml, 4 eqiuv). Dichloromethane
(3 × 5 mL2) and dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 ×
5 mL2) were employed to wash the reaction mixture after
each step of coupling, and 20% piperidine was added to remove the
Fmoc protection group. A test reagent (2% chloranil DMF, 2% ethanal
DMF) was applied to monitor the process of Fmoc deprotection and coupling
reaction. The resin was treated with TFA/TIS/H2O (95:2.5:2.5)
for 3 h to eliminate the tBu groups and to take the peptides off the
resin. The peptides were precipitated by Cold Et2O, collected,
and resuspended in Et2O. After sonication and centrifugation,
crude products were harvested, dissolved in water, and lyophilized.
The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography, and their identity was determined by mass spectrometry. m/z calculated 3511.8 [M]+ for
peptide CMP1, found 3510.9 [M]+; m/z calculated 3846.9 [M]+ for peptide CMP2, found
3846.0 [M]+; m/z calculated
3931.3 [M]+ for peptide CMP3, found 3931.3 [M]+.

Sample Preparation
Fresh solutions of CMP1 with a starting
concentration of 5.0 mg/mL were prepared under different pH conditions:
pH 7.0 (100 mM Hepes buffer), pH 6.0–6.4 (100 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer), and pH 2.6–5.0
(100 mM HAc–NaAc buffer). Fresh solutions of CMP2 and CMP3
with a starting concentration of 5.0 mg/mL were prepared under various
pH conditions: pH 7.0 (100 mM Hepes buffer) and pH 3.0–6.0
(50 mM HAc–NaAc buffer).

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
Circular dichroism
(CD) spectra were measured on an Aviv model 400 spectrophotometer
(Applied Photophysics Ltd, England) equipped with a Peltier temperature
controller. The CMP1 samples (142 μM) were prepared in 20 mM
Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.0. Wavelength scans were recorded from 210
to 260 nm at 4 °C. The CMP2 and CMP3 samples (300 μM) were
prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, and wavelength scans
were performed from 210 to 280 nm. The increment per step was 0.5
nm and averaging time was 0.5 s. Each measurement was performed three
times.

The thermal stability of the peptides was determined
by measuring the intensity of the CD peak at 225 nm when the temperature
was gradually increased from 4 to 85 °C. The average heating
rate was 0.4 or 0.5 °C/min and the equilibration time was 2 min.
The peptides were heated at 90 °C for 20 min and incubated at
4 °C for >24 h. The first derivative of the unfolding curve
was
computed and smoothed by the Savitzky–Golay method. The melting
temperature (Tm) was estimated as the
extrema of the first derivative.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM images of the peptide-Ln3+ nanomaterials were recorded
on a Hitachi S-4800 scanning
electron microscope (Hitachi Limited, Japan). The operating voltage
was 5.1–5.3 kV. The peptide CMP1 solution (1.42 mM, 100 mM
Hepes buffer, pH 7.0) was incubated with lanthanide ions at different
molar ratios of peptide/Ln3+ in the range of 1:1 to 1:5
at 25 °C for 48 h. The peptide solutions of CMP2 and CMP3 (1.3
mM, 100 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0) were incubated with lanthanide ions
at 25 °C for 24 h, respectively. The peptide-Ln3+ mixtures
with observable white precipitates were centrifuged. The precipitates
were collected, washed with ultrapure water, and resuspended in ethanol.
20 μL of the resuspended solution was dried on a silicon slice
and then sputter-coated with AuPd for 20 s before imaging.

Transmission
Electron Microscopy
TEM images were obtained
using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL company).
The operating voltage was 200 kV. The precipitates of the peptide-Ln3+ mixture were prepared by the same steps as the SEM measurements.
The resuspended solution (10 μL) was deposited on a copper grid
coated with the carbon film and kept for three minutes to allow deposition.
After carefully removing excessive buffer by filter paper, the copper
grid was negatively stained using 2.0% uranium acetate or 2.5% phosphotungstic
acid. The grid was dried for >12 h under ambient conditions.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence spectra were
recorded on a Hitachi FLS920 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments
company). A monochromated Xe lamp was used as an excitation source.
The peptide CMP1-Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, and Gd3+) aggregates were collected
after incubation at 25 °C for 48 h. The emission spectra were
measured for the peptide-Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, and Gd3+) nanomaterials, and
the excitation wavelengths were 394, 370, 365, and 303 nm, respectively.
Photographs were recorded with a DMI4000B LEICA inverted fluorescence
microscope.

Cell Adhesion Assay
Ninety-six-well
microtiter plates
(non-tissue culture) were coated with native Type I collagen, peptide
CMP1-La3+, CMP2-La3+, and peptide
CMP3-La3+ nanomaterials, respectively. The control wells
of the plate were coated with heat-denatured BSA. Phosphate buffered
saline buffer (PBS) (10 mM) was then used to wash the wells three
times before culturing the Hela cells. 100 μL of cell suspension
in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (1
× 106 cells/mL) was added into the wells and grown
at 37 °C for 4 h. Unattached cells were removed by washing using
PBS buffer (10 mM).

The amount of attached cells were determined
by a total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) quantification assay (Hoechst
33258, Solarbio). Briefly, the adhered cells in each well were lysed
by three freeze-thaw cycles using ultrapure water. Hoechst 33258 with
a final concentration of 5 μg/mL was applied to the cell lysates
and kept in the dark for 1 h. A microplate reader (Tecan Infinite
M200) was employed to measure the fluorescence, while the excitation
and emission wavelengths were 360 and 465 nm, respectively. The assays
were carried out in triplicate.

Immunofluorescence Staining
Fluorescent confocal dishes
(Nontreated) were treated with one thin layer of CMP1-La3+, CMP2-La3+, and CMP3-La3+ substrates,
respectively. PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.2–7.4) was used to wash
the coverslips 3 times before culturing the cells. HeLa cells with
a density of ∼600 cells/mm2 in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium were added on the coverslips and nurtured
at 37 °C for 4 h. Cold 4.0% formaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100
were used to fix and permeabilize the attached cells for 10 min and
5 min, respectively. 1% BSA in PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.2–7.4)
was then applied as a blocking agent for 0.5 h at room temperature.
The cells were mixed with 1 mL of 100 nM phalloidin–tetramethylrhodamine
isothiocyanate (Solarbio, China) (in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.2–7.4))
for 1 h. The cell actin cytoskeleton and cell nucleus were then stained
by the addition of 1 mL 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich)
(in ultrapure water). The images were recorded on OLYMPUS Fluoview
FV3000.
