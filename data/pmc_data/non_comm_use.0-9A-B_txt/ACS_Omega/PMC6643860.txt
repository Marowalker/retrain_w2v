We report for the
first time that alkali carbonates (Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3) based on
a low-temperature solution process can be used
as interfacial modifiers for SnO2 as robust electron-transport
layers (ETL) for inverted organic solar cells (iOSCs). The room-temperature
photoluminescence, the electron-only devices, and the impedance studies
altogether suggested the interfacial properties of the alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 ETLs, which were much better than those based on the
SnO2 only, provided efficient charge transport, and reduced
the charge recombination rates for iOSCs. The iOSCs using the polymer
donor poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] and the fullerene acceptor phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester as the active layer showed the
average power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) based on ten devices
of 6.70, 6.85, and 7.35% with Li2CO3-, K2CO3-, and Rb2CO3-modified
SnO2 as ETLs, respectively; these are more than 22, 24,
and 33% higher than those based on the SnO2 only (5.49%).
Moreover, these iOSC devices exhibited long-term stabilities, with
over 90% PCEs remaining after the devices were stored in ambient air
for 6 weeks without encapsulations. We believe that alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 approaches are an effective way to achieve stable
and highly efficient iOSCs and might also be suitable for other optoelectronic
devices where an ETL is needed, such as perovskite solar cells or
organic light-emitting diodes.

1 Introduction
Among
various types of solar cells, bulk-heterojunction organic
solar cells (OSCs) have received great attention from both academic
and industrial researchers as the third generation of solar-cell technology.1−6 These types of solar cells have unique advantages, such as light
weight, abundant materials, simple preparation at a low cost, and
a high-throughput solution process, which is highly suitable to roll-to-roll
printing technology on flexible substrates.2−6 Despite these huge advantages, however, in reality,
OSCs have shown lack of stability and inferior power-conversion efficiency
(PCE) compared to the counterpart dye-sensitized and commercial silicon
solar cells;7,8 these are the main obstacles that
prevent OSCs from entering the real photovoltaic market.9 Along with the development of new donor–acceptor
materials and the interfacial engineering for OSCs, nowadays a PCE
over 14% can be achieved with great improvement in device stability.10,11

Conventional OSCs are usually based on an acid and hygroscopic
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PETDOT:PSS)
deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as a hole-collecting layer,
and a metal of low work function (WF) like Al or Ca is used as the
cathode.12 After a while, these low-WF
metals in the cathode will react with oxygen and moisture in ambient
air to form an insulating metal oxide like Al2O3, which may build a barrier against carrier transport; on the other
hand, the acid and hygroscopic PETDOT:PSS will corrode the ITO, which
leads to the deterioration of the anode side.13 To circumvent these problems, inverted organic solar cells (iOSCs)
have been introduced to simultaneously eliminate the use of acid and
hygroscopic PETDOT:PSS as well as the unstable low WF on both sides
for OSCs.11,14 The iOSCs are normally built with a high
optical transparency and stable metal oxide deposited on ITO as the
top cathode side to assemble electrons, whereas an ultrastable high-WF
metal like Ag or Au is used as the bottom anode side to gather holes.11,14 Thus, these iOSCs are firmly protected on both sides against the
penetration of oxygen and moisture from the ambient environment.11,14

To obtain a stable and highly efficient iOSC, one of the most
effective
ways is introducing a suitable electron-transport layers (ETL) between
the active layer and the ITO cathodes.15 Ideally, an ETL should serve multiple functions, including tuning
the energy-level alignment at the interface of the cathode and the
active layer, improving charge selectivity, controlling surface properties
of the cathode to alter the morphology of the active layer, increasing
light absorption into the active layer, and improving interfacial
engineering stability between the cathode and the active layer.16 However, a single ETL is usually not sufficient
to fulfill all these requirements. Thus, interfacial engineering,
like interfacial modifiers for ETLs, are receiving considerable attention
as a promising way to improve both photovoltaic performance and device
stability of iOSCs.17

Among various
materials that have been exploited as ETLs for iOSCs,
n-type metal oxides such as TiO2 and ZnO, which possess
a high optical transparency and excellent charge-transport properties,
are commonly used by several groups.18,19 Oxygen vacancy-related
defects that usually exist on metal oxides are likely to occur during
the synthesis process, leading to poor device performance. Several
kinds of materials, such as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs),20 nonconjugated polyelectrolytes (n-CPEs),17 small molecules,21 ionic liquids,22 alkali hydroxides,23 or cesium stearate,24 have been introduced to modified TiO2 or ZnO ETLs. Even
though these iOSCs were obtained with very high PCE, an extremely
high annealing temperature (∼400 to 500 °C) is usually
needed to prepare TiO2 during its fabrication; also, the
instability under UV light for both ZnO and TiO2 may eliminate
them as choices for ideal ETLs of commercial iOSCs in the near future.25 Note that the eventually commercial iOSCs are
built on flexible substrates, where a temperature higher than 200
°C is not allowed.5,6 Another serious drawback of the
iOSCs using these metal oxides is “light-soaking issues”;
that is, a UV-light source is required for normal device operation.26 Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel ETL
metal oxides with facile low-temperature solution processing; these
ETLs not only need to fulfill the requirements for an ideal ETL as
mentioned above, but also need extra properties, such as UV resistance
and light-soaking issues free for iOSCs.

Recently, SnO2 has been recognized as a highly promising
candidate for the electron-transport layer because of its merits,
such as abundant n-type material with high transparency, high conductivity,
a suitable conduction band minimum, excellent chemical stability,
and UV resistance.25,27,28 Interestingly, it has been reported that iOSCs based on SnO2 are not only of free light-soaking issues29 but also excellent in terms of device stability.30 Additionally, SnO2 possesses higher
electron mobility up to 240 cm2 V–1 s–1 (which is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher
than TiO2),27,31 and a wider band gap (3.6–4.0
eV),27,31 as well as low trap density compared with
ZnO and TiO2.32 Moreover, SnO2 has a very suitable conduction-band minimum (CBM) for efficient
charge transport, and a deeper valence-band maximum (VBM), which is
helpful for hole blocking in iOSCs.33,34

In the
past, SnO2 has been noted for an excellent ETL
for optoelectronic devices;35 however,
the preparation of SnO2 is usually based on a high-cost
process like thermal evaporation, which is conducted at a high vacuum
pressure.30 Note that SnO2 can
be prepared by a solution process, but a high annealing temperature
(above 450 °C) is usually required to form crystalized SnO2.36 In 2015, with huge progress
in solution processing, SnO2 can be prepared at a much
lower temperature (∼180 °C) with high transparency and
uniform substrate coverage.33 Note that
a low temperature of about 180 °C is possible for a low-cost,
high-throughput roll-to-roll printing technique on flexible substrates
for eventually commercial iOSCs.25 To date,
there are reports for low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 as ETLs;25,27,28,33 however, most of them are applied to perovskite
solar cells. To our knowledge, so far, there are few reports on SnO2 ETLs, and in most cases, these iOSCs are based on a normal
well-studied P3HT:PC60BM active layer.37−39 Besides, very
recently, Shen et al. reported that a poly(9,9-n-dihexyl-2,7-fluorene-alt-9-phenyl-3,6-carbazole (PFN) can modify SnO2 as ETLs for polymer solar cells (PSCs) based poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th):phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). An impressive PCE
of 11.05% was achieved; however, their PSC devices based on SnO2 only revealed a humble PCE of 4.31% due to trap-induced recombination
at the interface between the SnO2 and the active layer.40 Moreover, Shen et al. have not studied the device
stability of PSCs.40

Among several
materials in the past, alkali carbonates have been
used as independent ETLs for iOSCs because of their effective electron-transport
properties.41,42 However, because of their weak
hole-blocking properties, alkali carbonates eliminated themselves
as candidates for ideal ETLs of iOSCs.43 Recently, alkali carbonates have emerged as a doping source or modifiers
for ETLs and have shown good improvements in device performance, ranging
from iOSCs to perovskite solar cells.44,45 However, to
our knowledge, so far there is no published work on using any kind
of alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 for polymer-based
iOSCs (e.g., PTB7-Th:PC70BM).

In this contribution,
we first report on the use of alkali carbonates
(Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3) as efficient modifiers for SnO2 as ETLs for improving the device performance of iOSCs based on a
facile low-temperature solution process (our annealing temperature
was 185 °C for SnO2 and 120 °C for alkali carbonates).
In our work, SnO2/alkali carbonates were achieved simply
by spin-coating alkali carbonate solutions with a concentration of
1 mg mL–1 in deionized (DI) water onto the prepared
SnO2. The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL), the
electron-only devices, and the impedance studies were employed as
effective tools for demonstrating the excellent interfacial properties
of the alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 ETLs as compared
to those based on SnO2 only. The iOSCs using the polymer
donor PTB7-Th and the fullerene acceptor PC70BM as the
active layer show average PCEs based on ten devices of 6.70, 6.85,
and 7.35% with Li2CO3-, K2CO3-, and Rb2CO3-modified SnO2 as ETLs, respectively; these values are more than 22, 24, and 33%
higher than those based SnO2 only (5.49%). Furthermore,
our iOSC devices also exhibited long-term stabilities, with over 90%
of PCEs remaining after storing the devices in ambient air for 6 weeks
without encapsulations. To our knowledge, the excellent chemical stability
of SnO2, the inverted-geometry type of devices, and, more
importantly, the better interfacial engineering stability between
SnO2 and the active layer with alkali carbonate modifiers
are the compelling reasons for our iOSC device stabilities. We believe
that the alkali–carbonates-modified SnO2 approach
can be an effective way to obtain stable and highly efficient iOSCs.
Its applications may be extended to other optoelectronic devices where
an ETL is necessary, such as perovskite solar cells or organic light-emitting
diodes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optical
Properties of SnO2 and
SnO2/Alkali Carbonate Films
In general, the optical
properties of the ETLs in the wavelengths ranging from 380 to 750
nm (visible wavelength range) play a very important role in the performance
of the iOSCs.46 A higher transparency of
the ETLs will help a greater ratio of photons reach the active layer,
resulting in better photocurrents, which will help achieve a higher
PCE of the iOSCs.46 It is self-evident
that, to ensure that enough photons reach the active layer, the transparency
of an ideal ETL should be over 85% in the visible wavelength range.47 To evaluate the optical properties of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate films, we conducted
UV–vis absorption and transmittance measurements on these samples. Figure 1a,b shows the UV–vis
absorption and optical transmission spectra of SnO2 and
SnO2/alkali carbonate films on glass substrates. It is
interesting that all the SnO2 or SnO2/alkali
carbonate samples exhibit excellent optical properties, with average
transmittance over 97% in the visible range. Compared to SnO2, the SnO2/alkali carbonate samples show a slightly better
transmittance, perhaps because of the reduced reflection. The excellent
optical properties of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate
samples make them ideal candidates for ETLs for the eventual commercialization
of organic solar-cell technology.

2.2 Photoluminescence Studies
for SnO2 and SnO2/Alkali Carbonate Films
Photoluminescence
(PL) studies are an effective tool for evaluating the merits of ideal
ETLs in terms of the charge recombination in iOSCs.48 In general, the oxygen-vacancy-related defects that usually
exist on metal oxides are likely to occur during the synthesis process.48,49 These defects act as recombination centers that lead to poor performance
for iOSCs. We conducted room-temperature PL measurements on SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate samples with a wavelength
excitation of 350 nm; their PL results are presented in Figure 1c. Because the excitation energy
(3.54 eV) is smaller than the optical band gaps of SnO2 (3.87 eV), SnO2/Li2CO3 (3.89 eV),
SnO2/K2CO3 (3.90 eV), and SnO2/Rb2CO3 (3.96 eV) samples (as given
in Figure S1, Supporting Information),
the band-edge emission was not detected in our PL emission spectra.
The three clear-blue emissions were clearly seen for all SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate samples, which likely originated
from oxygen-vacancy-related defects in our samples. However, all SnO2/alkali carbonate samples revealed a significant quenching
of PL intensity at the region of 350–600 nm in comparison to
the SnO2 only sample. Among the SnO2/alkali
carbonate samples, SnO2 modified with Rb2CO3 showed the maximum quenching of the PL intensity, suggesting
that the best performance of iOSCs can be achieved by using SnO2/Rb2CO3 as an ETL.

It was observed
that there is a small peak in SnO2 around 760 nm (the inset
in Figure 1c), which
might stem from the intrinsic defects in SnO2 related to
oxygen vacancies during the solution-process method, as discussed
in previous reports.50−52 Obviously, compared to the peak in SnO2 of around 760 nm, the PL intensities of SnO2 modified
with alkali carbonates samples showed significant quenching, suggesting
the effective passivation of the defects in SnO2 with alkali
carbonates.

2.3 Morphology Investigation
of SnO2 and SnO2/Alkali Carbonate Films
Apart from the
optical properties, the surface morphology of an ETL has a significant
effect on the performance of iOSC devices.19,53 A proper topography of ETLs will help to build a good physical contact
with the active layer, allowing an efficient charge extraction and
carrier transport at the interface from the active layer to the ETL
of iOSCs.16 Thus, good morphology with
suitable surface roughness values is desirable for achieving highly
efficient iOSCs. Figure 1d–g presents the AFM height images of SnO2 and
alkali carbonates modified SnO2 films on the ITO glass
substrates. The surface roughness root-mean-square (RMS) values of
SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 as shown in Figure 1d–g are 1.34, 1.21, 1.45, and 1.18 nm, respectively.
Obviously, all these RMS values are significantly lower than that
of a bare ITO glass substrate (1.94 nm) (Figure S2), demonstrating the excellent morphology of our ETL samples.
Compared to those based on SnO2 only, all alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 samples exhibit slight differences in RMS surface
roughness values. However, the best surface roughness value was obtained
for the Rb2CO3-modified SnO2 samples.
Generally speaking, a lower RMS surface roughness value is needed
to guarantee an intimate contact between the ETLs and the active layers,
contributing to reducing the series resistances of iOSCs to increase
PCE.53 Based on the AFM results; we think
the best performance of iOSCs may be by those using SnO2/Rb2CO3 as ETLs. The three-dimensional (3D)
AFM images of SnO2 and alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 samples are also given in Figure S3. Besides the AFM measurements, the surface of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate samples were also investigated
using the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization.
The detailed observations from the SEM images of our ETL samples (Figure S4) seem to be strongly consistent with
their AFM results. The coexistence and uniform distribution of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate films on ITO glass substrates
can be further demonstrated via energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum
and elemental mapping analysis (Figures S5–S8). Note that, from Figure S6, presenting
the EDX spectrum and elemental mapping analysis for SnO2/Li2CO3, the Li elements were not seen because
of the limits of detection of EDX analysis in our SEM measurement
systems (the first three elements, H, He, and Li, of the periodic
table are not detectable by normal EDX analysis because of the very
low energy of their characteristic radiation). The presence of Li
in SnO2/Li2CO3 can be proved using
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, presented in
the next section.

2.4 Structural Properties and
Chemical States
of SnO2 and SnO2/Alkali Carbonate Films
The structural properties of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali
carbonate samples were first investigated using X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis. Figure S9 presents the
XRD spectra of SnO2 and of SnO2/alkali carbonate
ETLs coated on glass substrates. Obviously, no clear dominant peaks
of SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs can be
clearly seen in the XRD pattern for SnO2 (JCPDS card no.
41-1445), perhaps because of the amorphous structure of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali ETLs caused by the low-temperature annealing
(∼185 °C), reported by several groups.54,55

Because we could not obtain enough information to firmly confirm
the component and chemical states of the SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate samples via XRD, we further conducted XPS
measurements on our ETL samples to demonstrate their chemical states. Figure 2a–c gives
the XPS spectra surveys along with XPS spectra profiles of the Sn
3d and O 1s regions of the SnO2 and SnO2/alkali
carbonate ETL samples. To our knowledge, in general, the Sn 3d5/2 peaks in SnOx consisted of
three peak components: Sn4+ is located at 486.58 eV, Sn2+ at 485.88 eV (the Sn2+ shifted to a lower binding
energy by 0.7 eV compared to Sn4+), and Sn0+ at 484.38 eV (the Sn0+ shifted to a much lower binding
energy by 2.2 eV compared to Sn4+).56,57 On the other hand, the O 1s peaks in SnOx are known to be constructed by two binding components: O–Sn4+ and O–Sn2+, which have binding energies
of 530.37 and 529.77 eV, respectively (O–Sn2+ shifted
to a lower binding energy by 0.6 eV compared to O–Sn4+).56,57 As displayed in Figure 2a,b, the binding energy values of the Sn
3d5/2 and the O 1s peaks of our SnO2 ETL samples
are 486.98 and 530.54 eV, which correspond to Sn4+ constituent
and O–Sn4+, respectively. Note that in our SnO2 ETL samples, the peaks related to the Sn2+ constituent
and O–Sn2+ were not seen, which is compelling evidence
that confirmed the pure SnO2 component states in our ETL
samples. Interestingly, SnO2 modified with the alkali carbonates
revealed the same dominant peaks for Sn4+ and O–Sn4+ binding energies at 486.58 and 530.27 eV, respectively.
Compared to the SnO2 only, the positions of these dominant
peaks were shifted to a bit lower binding energy that may be ascribed
to the electronegative anion component (CO3)2– of alkali carbonates. Figure 2d–f shows the XPS spectra of the Li, K, and Rb regions
for SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 samples, respectively. As can be seen from Figure 2d–f, the dominant peaks are located
at 55.90, 292.70, and 110.60 eV, which can be assigned to Li 1s of
Li2CO3, K 2p3/2 of K2CO3, and Rb 3d5/2 of Rb2CO3,
respectively.58 Thus, we may conclude that
our XPS results are strong evidence that confirms the coexistence
of the alkali carbonates (Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3) in our SnO2/alkali carbonate ETL samples.

2.5 Calculation
of Band Gaps and Energy Levels
of ETLs
Based on the UV–absorption profiles of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs (Figure 1a), the band gaps (Eg) of these ETLs were then calculated via the
Tauc plot method with the following equation: (αhν)2 = A(hν
– Eg),59 where hν is stands for the photo energy, A is a constant, and α is the absorption coefficient. Figure S1 presents the Tauc plots of (αhν)2 versus hν of
SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs. By executing
the linear extrapolation for these curves, as can be seen in Figure S1, the band gaps were found to be 3.87,
3.89, 3.90, and 3.96 eV for SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs, respectively.
It appears that the band gaps of SnO2/alkali carbonate
ETLs show a slight increase compared to the SnO2 only;
this may be ascribed to a slight shift up of the conduction band edges
of these ETLs caused by the presence of alkali carbonates on SnO2.

To identify the energy-level alignment between the
ETLs and the active layers, the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
(UPS) measurements were carried out on SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate samples. Figure 3 shows the UPS spectra on the valance-band
regions (Eonset), survey, and secondary
electron cutoffs (Ecutoff) of SnO2 and alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 coatings
on ITO glass substrates. As displayed in Figure 3a,c, the Eonset were found to be 3.85, 3.83, 3.72, and 3.69 eV and the Ecutoff were 16.81, 17.13, 17.19, and 17.14 eV for SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs, respectively. The valence-band maximums (VBM) of these
ETLs can be computed using the following formulation60  where hν = 21.22 eV
is the incident photo energy from a He(I) source of UPS measurement
systems. The VBMs were calculated and found to be −8.26, −7.92,
−7.77, and −7.75 eV for SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs, respectively.
The conduction-band minimums (CBM) of SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs were
deduced from their Eg and VBMs, as −4.39,
−4.03, −3.85, and −3.81 eV, respectively. Note
that these CBM and VBM values of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonates will be used to build an energy-level diagram
of the ETL components of the iOSCs in the next section (Figure 4c). Because the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of PC70BM is about −3.9
eV, the reduction of CBMs of ETLs can help to build a favorable energy
alignment between the ETLs and the active layers. For SnO2/K2CO3 and SnO2/Rb2CO3, the VBMs were shifted up to −3.85, and −3.81
eV, respectively, which is higher than that of PC70BM (−3.9
eV), and switches the electric contact between the ETL and the active
layer from a Schottky to an Ohmic contact, as a salient feature for
an ideal ETL. Given no energy barrier between PC70BM and
SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs, the electrons can easily be
extracted and transported from PC70BM through these ETLs
to the cathodes in iOSCs.

current, and (f) external quantum efficiency (EQE).

It is well known that the WF of the cathode can
be used as an effective
tool to evaluate the charge-transport properties of the ETLs and the Voc in iOSCs. We have calculated the WF for our
ETL samples using the following expression60,61  The WF of SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs were
then figured out to be 4.41, 4.09, 4.03, and 4.08 eV, respectively.
Evidently, all SnO2/alkali carbonate samples had shown
a significant WF reduction in comparison to the SnO2, suggesting
that efficient charge transport in OSCs can be obtained by using SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs. To our knowledge, the reduction
of the WF with alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 might
originate from the formation of an interface dipole between the alkali
atoms and the metal oxides (M–O–A) in SnO2/alkali carbonate samples, where M, O, and A stand for metal, oxygen,
and alkali metal species, respectively.23

2.6 Device Performance of iOSCs Using SnO2 and SnO2/Alkali Carbonates as ETLs
Figure 4a presents the chemical
structures of the polymer donor PTB7-Th and the fullerene acceptor
PC70BM. The device structure and energy-level diagram of
the iOSCs using SnO2 or SnO2/carbonates as ETLs
are given in Figure 4b,c, respectively. Cross-sectional SEM images of these complete iOSC
devices can be seen in Figure S10.

Figure 4d shows typical
characteristics of iOSCs using SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs under one-sun illumination (100 mW cm–2 AM 1.5G). The iOSCs based on the SnO2 only
as ETLs show an average in ten iOSC devices with a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 16.71
mA cm–2, an fill factor (FF) of 47.68%, and an overall
PCE of 5.49%. When using alkali carbonates (Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3)
as interfacial modifiers for SnO2 as ETLs, the performance
of these iOSCs was greatly improved, with average PCEs of 6.70% (Jsc = 16.88 mA cm–2, Voc = 0.77 V, and FF = 51.48%), 6.85% (Jsc = 16.85 mA cm–2, Voc = 0.77 V, and FF = 52.91%), and 7.35% (Jsc = 16.89 mA cm–2, Voc = 0.78 V, and FF = 55.55%) for SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs, respectively,
as summarized in Table 1; these are more than 22, 24, and 33% higher than the PCE of those
based on the SnO2 only (5.49%). Note that the detailed
photovoltaic parameters of all those iOSCs devices are recorded and
given in Tables S1–S4; the PCE distribution
of these devices is presented in Figure S11. Evidently, all the iOSCs using SnO2/alkali carbonate
ETLs show a much better performance than those based on the SnO2-only ETLs. It appears that the improved performance of the
iOSC devices could be attributed to the improvement of Jsc, Voc, and FF. Although
the improvements of Jsc are not obvious,
the improvement of Voc and FF are clearly
seen. To our knowledge, the Voc of those
iOSCs using SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs are improved
mainly because of a significant reduction of WF of these ETLs in comparison
to those based on SnO2 only,62,63 although the
great suppression of charge recombination in those iOSCs might be
another reason.62,63 On the other hand, the significant
improvements in FF for those iOSCs might originate from surface passivation,
which reduces oxygen-vacancy-related defects in SnO2 with
alkali carbonate modifiers.

To better understand charge-transport
properties of ETLs in our
iOSC system, we have further fabricated iOSC devices using alkali
carbonates only without SnO2 ETLs (based on the bare ITO
glass only). The device characteristics of iOSC devices with bare
ITO and alkali carbonates only as ETLs are embellished in Figure 4d–f, whereas
their photovoltaic parameters are given in Tables 1 and S5. It is
revealed that the average PCEs of the iOSC devices using bare ITO,
Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3 as ETLs are 0.95, 3.08, 5.13, and 5.27%, respectively.
Obviously, the PCEs of iOSCs using alkali carbonates only as ETLs
are inferior to iOSC devices based on the SnO2 or alkali
carbonates–modified SnO2, demonstrating the more
powerful electron-transport properties of SnO2 or alkali
carbonates–modified SnO2 in comparison to the alkali
carbonates only.

Figure 4e shows
the dark current of iOSCs using SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs; their EQEs are given in Figure 4f. A lower leakage current
(Figure 4e) along with
a higher EQE (Figure 4f) for those using SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs are compelling
evidence for improvements in Jsc to higher
PCEs of those iOSCs. Note that, in general, a higher electron-collection
ratio from the active layer to the cathode will benefit from a lower
leakage current, which results in a higher Jsc, whereas a higher light-to-photons conversion ratio in those
iOSC devices benefits from their higher EQE, which leads to the increased Jsc. Interestingly, we observe the trend in improving
iOSC device performance with alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 from Li2CO3 to Rb2CO3. To our knowledge, this might originate from the increased
dipole moments at the interface between the active layers and the
ETLs because of the increasing electronegativity of the alkali metals,
from Li to Rb.23 It has been reported that
the counter anions of electron-transport materials showed different
behaviors in OSCs.64,65 Because these alkali carbonates
possess different metal ions, especially the sizes of these metal
ions are different, the different behaviors in our iOSCs are expected.
Compared to (Li2CO3 and K2CO3), Rb2CO3 possess the biggest size of
metal ions of Rb, thus Rb2CO3 can form the strongest
interaction (M–O–A) in SnO2/alkali carbonate
samples, which is a clear evidence which elucidates that the performance
of iOSCs using SnO2/Rb2CO3 showed
the best average PCEs (7.35%). Meanwhile, the average PCEs of the
iOSC devices based on SnO2/K2CO3 (6.85%)
appear slightly higher than that of SnO2/Li2CO3 (6.70%), which is consistent with the weaker interaction
(M–O–A) in SnO2/Li2CO3 compared to the SnO2/K2CO3 (due
to the size of Li ions is less than that of K ions). It has been noted
that the trend in improvement in iOSC device performance with alkali
carbonates–modified SnO2, from Li2CO3 to Rb2CO3, is well consistent with
the increased size of metal ions from Li to Rb in alkali carbonates.

At this point, it can be anticipated that alkali carbonate with
bigger sizes of metal ions might exhibit a better device performance
in iOSCs. To confirm this behavior of alkali carbonates in device
performance of iOSCs, we have further fabricated iOSCs using another
alkali carbonate like Cs2CO3, which possess
a bigger size of metal ions of Cs than Rb in Rb2CO3, to modified SnO2 as ETLs. Besides, to compare
electron-transport properties of SnO2 with those of alkali
carbonates–modified SnO2, we have also fabricated
iOSCs based on Cs2CO3 only (without SnO2) as ETLs. As expected, it revealed that the average PCEs
of the iOSC devices using Cs2CO3-modified SnO2 as ETLs are 7.52% (Table S6, or Figure S12), which is slightly higher than that
of the devices based on Rb2CO3-modified SnO2 (7.35%). To our knowledge, the reason behind this interesting
result of iOSCs using SnO2/Cs2CO3 might originate from a stronger interaction (M–O–A)
in SnO2/Cs2CO3 compared to the SnO2/Rb2CO3 due to the bigger size of metal
ions of Cs in comparison to Rb. Moreover, it has been shown that the
average PCEs of iOSCs using Cs2CO3 only without
SnO2 ETLs are 5.40% (Table S6, or Figure S12), which is inferior to
iOSC devices based on the SnO2 or alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2, thus firmly confirming the more powerful electron-transport
properties of SnO2 or alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 in comparison to the alkali carbonates only.

2.7 UV Absorption, PL Quenching, and Morphology
Studies of the Active Layers
To elucidate the performance
of iOSCs using SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonates
as ETLs, we first studied the UV absorption and PL quenching of the
active layers with a configuration of glass/ETLs/PTB7-Th:PC70BM samples as visualized by a schematic diagram as the inset of Figure 5a, which displays
the UV absorption of the active layers with different ETLs; it appears
that all alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 exhibited
some increase in the 380–760 nm range. Among these alkali carbonate
samples, the active layers deposited on SnO2/Rb2CO3 show a maximum absorption improvement relative to
the SnO2 only. General speaking, the better light harvesting
of the active layers can directly affect the total light-to-photons
conversion ratio in iOSCs; as a result, a higher PCE can be accomplished.
It is worth mentioning here that these UV absorption results are strongly
consistent with EQE measurements (Figure 4f), which have shown better light absorption
in the 380–760 nm range.

Figure 5 (a) UV absorption and (b, c) room-temperature
PL spectra of the
active layers deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/alkali
carbonate ETLs on bare glass substrates. (d–g) AFM images of
the active layers deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs on ITO glass substrates.

The PL quenching of the active layer is an effective tool
for examining
the recombination rates in iOSCs. Figure 5b,c gives the survey PL in the whole wavelength
range and the PL at the PTB7-Th region, respectively, with a wavelength
excitation of 350 nm. Interestingly, the same PL quenching at ETL
regions was clearly seen, as compared to Figure 1c. As we discussed above in PL studies for
ETLs (Figure 1c), the
significant quenching at these regions (350–600 nm) likely
results from surface passivation, which helps to reduce the oxygen-vacancy-related
defects of SnO2 with alkali carbonate modifiers, whereas
the PL quenching in the PTB7-Th region suggests the suppression of
recombination processes and encourages charge transfer from the active
layer to the SnO2/alkali carbonate ETLs. In comparison
to the others, samples based on SnO2/Rb2CO3 show the maximum quenching in a wide wavelength range (300–900
nm). Our PL results are clear evidence that can be used to explain
our iOSC device performance.

Apart from PL-quenching studies,
the surface morphology of the
active layers also greatly affects their iOSC device performance. Figure 5d–g presents
the two-dimensional height AFM images of the PTB7-Th:PC70BM active layers coated on SnO2 and SnO2/alkali
carbonate ETLs on ITO glass substrates; their 3D AFM images are also
given in Figure S13. As seen in Figure 5d–g, the RMS
surface roughness values are 6.86, 5.39, 6.79, and 5.42 nm for PTB7-Th:PC70BM coatings on SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3, respectively. Evidently, all RMS surface roughness
values of those based on SnO2/alkali carbonates are lower
than those based on SnO2 only. Moreover, it is likely that
the PTB7-Th:PC70BM coatings on SnO2/alkali carbonate
ETLs show good phase separation together with favorable domain size,
which are considered as main factors for an effective charge-separation
process in iOSCs. In general, a lower RSM surface roughness of an
active layer not only helps to form an intimate contact between the
active layer and the hole-transporting layer but also reduces series
resistances in iOSC devices to improve PCE. It is clear that, besides
the PL results, the AFM measurements for our active layers are other
compelling evidence to explain our iOSC device performance.

2.8 Electron-Only Devices
To gain a deeper
understanding of how alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 affects the electron-transport properties of these ETLs in devices,
the electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/ETLs/PTB7-Th:PC70BM/LiF/Al were fabricated to calculate their electron mobility
(μe). The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method,
which is well known as the Mott–Gurney law, was chosen as a
standard model for the calculation of the electron mobility. Figure 6a presents the J–V characteristics measured in
the dark for these electron-only devices. The linear fittings for J0.5–V curves of these
devices are also given in Figure 6b. The μe of these electron-only devices
can be calculated using the Mott–Gurney formulation66−68  where JSCLC is
the current density obtained by measuring the electron-only devices
in the dark with the applied voltage potential (V), L is the thickness of the active layer of the
electron-only device, ε0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C V–1 m–1 is the electric or
permittivity of free space constant, and εr stands
for the relative dielectric constant of the active layer (PTB7-Th:PC70BM), which is normally assumed to be 3.5.67,68 The μe was found to be 5.78 × 10–4, 1.17 × 10–3, 1.26 × 10–3, and 1.52 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1 for SnO2, SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3 ETLs, respectively.
Obviously, the μe values of all the electron-only
devices with SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs are greater
than twice those based on the SnO2 only. These μe values are self-evident in explaining the improvements of
device performance for those using alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 as ETLs.

fitting for J0.5–V characteristics in the dark of the electron-only devices using SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs.

2.9 Electrochemical Impedance
Spectroscopy (EIS)
Studies
Apart from the electron mobility of the electron-only
devices, EIS is an effective tool for characterizing the charge-transport
and the recombination processes in an inner iOSC.69 To understand the carrier-transport and carrier-transfer
processes at the interface between the active layer and the ETLs,
impedance was measured on our iOSC devices. Figure 7 presents the Nyquist plots of the iOSC devices
measured in the dark with zero applied bias. The corresponding circuit
that fit these Nyquist plots is displayed in the inset of Figure 7. It is clear from
the Nyquist plots that the inner series resistances [the sheet resistance
(RS) and the charge transfer resistance
(RCT) at the interface of the active layer
and ETLs as well as between the ETLs and the electrode] of our iOSCs
were in the order of SnO2/Rb2CO3 <
SnO2/K2CO3 < SnO2/Li2CO3 < SnO2. In general, an efficient
charge extraction and charge transportation will benefit from a lower
contact resistance between the interfaces of the active layer and
ETLs, as well as between the ETLs and the electrode. Thus, the Nyquist
plots for our iOSC devices are clear evidence that explains the improvements
in device performance for those using alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 as ETLs.

using SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs,

with zero applied bias.

2.10 Device Stability Studies
Aside from
high efficiency, the long-term lifetime of iOSCs has become a great
obstacle in commercializing the eventual product of the iOSC technology.
In general, the lifetime of iOSCs depends on the time at which the
PCE retains 80% of the initial value.6 In
this respect, we studied the stability of iOSCs using SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs. The performance of
iOSC devices derived from SnO2 or SnO2/alkali
carbonates as ETLs was recorded for their storage in ambient air without
encapsulations; the detailed photovoltaic parameters of these devices
are summarized in Tables S7–S10. Figure 8 shows the device
stability results of our iOSCs. It appears that all our iOSC devices
had good long-term lifetime stability, with PCEs retaining more than
90% of their initial values after 6 weeks. To our knowledge, the excellent
long-term lifetime stability of our iOSC devices may have first originated
from the inverted device structure types with an air-stable high WF
metal (Ag),14,70 and more importantly due to the
ultrastability of our ETLs based on SnO2.30 It appears that the stability of the iOSCs using alkali
carbonates–modified SnO2 was significantly improved
because of the enhanced interfacial property between SnO2 and the active layer by inserting alkali carbonate modifiers. More
interestingly, among these alkali carbonates, Rb2CO3-modified SnO2 gives the best long-term stability
to iOSC devices. According to our results, Rb2CO3 modifier plays the best role in interfacial engineering improvements
(the best WF reduction, morphological improvement, and surface passivation
effects) between SnO2 and the active layer.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated
that alkali carbonates (Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3)
based on a facile low-temperature solution process are excellent modifiers
for SnO2 in applications as ETLs for iOSCs. A significant
reduction of the WF of the cathode, efficient charge transport and
extraction at the interface between the ETL and the active layer,
and a higher electron mobility can be achieved with alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2. These alkali carbonates can also help to greatly
passivate oxygen-vacancy-related defects that usually exist on SnO2. The iOSCs using the polymer donor PTB7-Th and the fullerene
acceptor PC70BM as the active layer show the average PCEs
based on ten devices of 6.70, 6.85, and 7.35% with Li2CO3-, K2CO3-, and Rb2CO3-modified SnO2 as ETLs, respectively; these are
more than 22, 24, and 33% higher than those based on SnO2 only (5.49%). Furthermore, our iOSCs show long-term stability, with
more than 90% PCEs retained after storage in ambient air for 6 weeks
without encapsulations. Our findings offer an effective way to achieve
highly efficient and stable iOSCs by using low-temperature solution
processed alkali carbonates–modified SnO2 as ETLs.
In addition, its application may be extended to other optical devices
that required an ETL, such as organic light-emitting diodes or perovskite
solar cells.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Chemicals used to prepare
SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate films were as
follows. Precursor tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 98%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, and ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.9%) was received from EMD Millipore Corporation.
Alkali carbonates [(Li2CO3, 99.997%), (K2CO3, 99.995%), and (Rb2CO3, 99.8%)] were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

The donor polymer poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) and the acceptor polymer
phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM)
were used to prepare the active layer; these materials were purchased
from Solarmer Energy, Inc., and Nano Holding, respectively. 1,2-Dichlorobenzene
(ODCB, 99%) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 98%, contains copper as stabilizer),
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), were used as solvent
and additive for preparing the active solution. Note that all these
chemicals were used as received, without any further purification.

4.2 Preparation of SnO2 and Alkali
Carbonate Solutions
The precursor solution of SnO2 (0.1 M) was obtained by dissolving 1.128 g precursor of tin (SnCl2·2H2O) in 50 mL absolute ethanol using a 100
mL round-bottom flask. The SnO2 solution was then stirred
for approximately 8 h at 80 °C in an oil bath. After this step,
the solution was removed from the oil bath and kept at room temperature
for at least 1 day, allowing the aging process. Afterward, we used
this solution for preparing SnO2 films by spin-coating
without any purification. It is worth mentioning here that the precursor
solution of SnO2 revealed very long-term stability. We
can use these solutions to prepare SnO2 ETLs up to 6 months
later. In our case, we experienced the same device performance using
the fresh solution of SnO2 or the aging solution, which
was kept at room temperature in a clear glass vial without any encapsulation
for up to 6 months.

Alkali carbonate solutions (Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3) were prepared with 10 mg of each alkali carbonate in a volume
20 mL clear glass vial. Then, 10 mL of DI water was added to each
vial to achieve three alkali carbonate solutions with the same concentration
of 1 mg mL–1. Prior to the spin-coating of alkali
carbonate layers on SnO2, these vials were stirred at room
temperature for about 3 h to form uniform and homogeneous alkali carbonate
solutions.

4.3 Preparation and Characterization
of SnO2 and SnO2/Alkali Carbonate Films
SnO2 films with a thickness of ∼20 to 25 nm on
the bare
glass or ITO glass were first achieved by using the prepared precursor
solution of SnO2 via the spin-coating technique on these
substrates in air, at 3000 rpm for 40 s. These samples were then annealed
on a hot plate at 185 °C for about 1 h. The SnO2/alkali
carbonate films (SnO2/Li2CO3, SnO2/K2CO3, and SnO2/Rb2CO3) were obtained by spin-coating each alkali carbonate
on the prepared SnO2 samples, at a speed of 4000 rpm for
40 s in air, to form a thickness of about 7–10 nm. After spin-coating,
the SnO2/alkali carbonate samples were dried at 120 °C
for 20 min. Note that, in making iOSC devices, the SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonate ETL samples were first prepared
as above and then transferred to a N2-filled glovebox while
waiting to deposit the active layer.

The optical properties
(UV–vis absorption and transmittance) of SnO2 and
SnO2/alkali carbonate films on glass substrates were measured
using the Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Room-temperature photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate
films coated on glass substrates and of the active layer deposited
on the ETLs glass/[SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonates]/PTB7-Th:PC70BM were recorded using a Jasco FP-6500 spectrophotometer
with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, tapping mode,
Bruker) were used to characterize the morphologies of the ETLs and
the active layers. The elemental mappings of SnO2 along
with SnO2/alkali carbonate samples were done with the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) tool equipped with the SEM system. The cross-sectional
SEM image of the complete iOSC devices using SnO2 or SnO2/alkali carbonates as ETLs were also obtained with the SEM
measurement system (Hitachi S-4800). The amorphous structure states
of SnO2 as well as of SnO2/alkali carbonate
films on the glass substrates caused by low-temperature annealing
(∼185 °C) were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the chemical
states and surface compositions of SnO2 and alkali carbonates–modified
SnO2 samples. Finally, to obtain detailed information on
the work functions and on the energy level of condition bands of SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate samples, we used ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, He I source, 21.2 eV, AXIS-ULTRA
DLD spectrometer system, Kratos Analytical, Ltd.) on these ETL samples.

4.4 Device Fabrication and Characterizations
4.4.1 Device Fabrication
ITO glass substrates
received from Korea Electronics Technology Institute (a sheet resistance
of 12 Ω/sq, 2.5 × 2.5 cm2) were first cleaned
with deionized (DI) water in a beaker in ultrasonic bath for 30 min;
then, the cleaning of the ITO glass substrates was continued with
acetone and isopropanol (IPA) source. Prior to coating the ETL, the
ITO glass substrates were dried using a heat gun. After coating SnO2 and SnO2/alkali carbonate (Li2CO3, K2CO3, and Rb2CO3) ETL films, these samples were moved to a N2-filled glovebox
to deposit the active layer. The thick active layer PTB7-Th:PC70BM (a thickness of ∼200 nm) was obtained by spin-coating
PTB7-Th:PC70BM (1:1.5 wt %, 30 mg mL–1) in mixed solvent ODCB:DIO (97:3 vol %) at a speed of 500 rpm for
40 s. Note that, before spin-coating, these mixing solutions of PTB7-Th:PC70BM were vigorously stirred at room temperature overnight
to make sure of a homogeneous and well-mixed active solution. After
spin-coating the active layers, the samples were initially dried for
about 5 min inside the glovebox before being transferred to a vacuum
chamber for thermal evaporation. To obtain complete drying and to
remove the additive (DIO), the samples were kept inside the vacuum
chamber for approximately 3 h before the electrode-deposition processes.71 To complete the device fabrication, a 10 nm
MoO3 hole-transporting layer and 100 nm Ag were subsequently
thermally evaporated onto active layers through a shadow mask to form
the top anode of the iOSC devices under a high vacuum at a pressure
less than 1 × 10–6 Torr. Here, the thermal
evaporation rates of MoO3 and Ag were controlled at 0.1
and 2 Å s–1, respectively. A LiF (0.6 nm)/Al
(100 nm) electrode were used for the electron-only device fabrication.
The thermal evaporation rates of LiF and Al were also controlled at
0.1 and 2 Å s–1, respectively. Note that all
the devices had an effective area of 0.11 cm2, as determined
by the shadow masks.

4.4.2 Characterization
Device performance
of all iOSCs was measured using the solar cell I–V system with a source Keithley 2400, conducted in ambient
conditions. To obtain the dark current and the normal J–V characteristics, iOSC devices were measured
in the dark or under standard conditions (100 mW cm–2 AM 1.5 G), respectively. For normal testing, prior to the measurements,
the light illumination of the system was calibrated with a monocrystalline
silicon solar cell (2 × 2 cm2, calibrated at NREL,
CO) to set the standard conditions (100 mW cm–2 AM
1.5 G). All the iOSC devices were scanned in the reverse direction,
from −1 to 1 V, at a scan speed of 0.2 V s–1; the scan step was 0.02 V and the delay time was 10 ms. The J–V characteristics of the electron-only
devices were also obtained with the Keithley 2400 equipment, measured
in the dark with an applied voltage ranging from 0 to 3.5 V, at a
scan speed of 0.2 V s–1, a scan step of 0.05 V,
and a delay time of 100 ms. A Polaronix K3100 spectrometer system
was used to record the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the iOSC
devices. The impedance studies for the iOSC devices were conducted
via a VersaSTAT3 (METEK) system; the frequency was set between 10
kHz and 0.1 Hz, measured in the dark with zero applied bias.
