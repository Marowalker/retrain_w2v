An intermediate unit (IMU) of tandem
organic light-emitting diode
(TOLED) can affect the emission spectral stability because of the
different charge-carrier migration and outcoupling efficiency at intermediate/emitting
unit interface. In this work, an IMU consisting of carbon 60 and copper(II)
phthalocyanine, inserted between red-emitting unit and blue-emitting
unit, were constructed and fabricated. We focus on the effect of the
relative location of the red-emitting unit and blue-emitting unit
in the device configuration on the emission spectral stability of
TOLED. In the color-tunable TOLED, a maximum current efficiency of
20.4 cd/A, along with light-emitting spectra tuning from red emission
at (0.63, 0.31) according to Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage
coordinates at a bias of 10 V to white emission at (0.34, 0.27) at
22 V, is realized. Meanwhile, in the color-stable TOLED, a maximum
current efficiency of 15.5 cd/A and a stable white emission at (0.31,
0.27) in a wide range of biases from 12 to 22 V are also obtained.
This work might inspire a promising approach for the fabrication of
color-tunable and color-stable OLEDs for both information display
and solid-state lighting.

1 Introduction
Owing
to the remarkable performance of organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs), including wide color gamut, low power consumption, high refresh
rate, and mechanical flexibility, extensive studies on them have been
a research highlight in the field of display and lighting technologies
for decades.1−5 Notably, there are different technical requirements for OLED display
and lighting technologies. For display demand, future high-resolution
OLED display requires red–green–blue (RGB) pixel size
as small as possible. Thus, it would be highly promising to utilize
a novel type of emitting pixel, which vertically stacks RGB electroluminescence
(EL) units in a single device, other than three different pixels.
Therefore, compared to conventional OLEDs, color-tunable OLEDs hold
great potential in the commercialization of next-generation ultra-high-resolution
OLED displays. For lighting demand, the color stability should be
taken into consideration when evaluating the lighting source. The
color shift needs to be strictly controlled during operation, meaning
the variation of Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE)
coordinates should be as small as possible.6

Diverse approaches for the realization of color-tunable OLEDs
have
been reported. Initially, the color-tunable OLEDs adopt plurality
of ways to control the emitting intensity of different emitting units.
For example, Forrest et al. used Mg–Ag–indium tin oxide
(ITO) as intermediate layer to connect the blue-emitting unit and
red-emitting unit and realized the first color-tunable device.7 After that, Chen et al. adopted a side-by-side
red, green, and blue subcells arrangement scheme with two alternate
current driving sources to fabricate color-tunable OLEDs.8 Then, to simplify the structure of devices, a
color-tunable OLED consisting of red-, green-, and blue-emitting layers
(EMLs) without tandem structure was also achieved by controlling the
voltage to change the position of the electron–hole recombination.
For instance, Meng et al. fabricated a solution-processed OLED with
four adjacent EMLs.9 Xu et al. reported
a fluorescent OLED by using two nondoped ultrathin yellow and blue
EMLs.10 Recently, inserting an exciton
adjusting interlayer in two or three complementary EMLs is used as
an effective route to attain color-tunable OLEDs, which further simplifies
the device structure.11 On the other hand,
lighting technology, unlike the color-tunable OLEDs with their voltage-dependent
color shifts, requires stable luminescent property.12,13 According to previous research, single-emitting layer structure
is a convenient approach to white light by incorporating multiple
emitters (blue/orange or red/green/blue) into a single layer.14,15 Moreover, to obtain superior efficiency and stable color spectra
simultaneously, the luminophores of different emitting colors can
be placed in individual units to produce white light, called as the
tandem organic light-emitting diode (TOLED).16

As mentioned above, previous works on color-stable and color-tunable
OLEDs have met the requirements of lighting and display technologies,
respectively. Several theories, such as charge injection and hopping
model,17 exciton density equation,18 and a triplet diffusion model for analyzing
energy transfer,19 have been applied to
simulate charge transport and exciton transfer in OLEDs. Nevertheless,
the above-mentioned mechanisms only considered electrical properties,
with no optical properties included. Moreover, transformation between
color-tunable and color-stable OLEDs is still challenging in current
research. Furthermore, the mechanism behind this transformation may
not only promote the development of both color-tunable and color-stable
OLEDs but also realize the integration of multifunctional devices.

In this work, we demonstrate the effect of intermediate unit (IMU)
consisting of carbon 60 (C60) and copper(II) phthalocyanine
(CuPc) on device emission spectral stability using two tandem OLEDs
(TOLEDs) with a blue-emitting unit and another red-emitting unit.
By simply switching the relative location of the red-emitting unit
and blue-emitting unit in the device configuration, both color-tunable
and color-stable light emission can be simultaneously obtained, which
is much different from the previous studies of either color-stable
or color-tunable tandem OLED. A maximum current efficiency of 20.4
cd/A and various color tuned from red at (0.63, 0.31) to white at
(0.34, 0.27) are achieved in color-tunable TOLED. On the other hand,
the color-stable TOLED demonstrates a stable white at (0.31, 0.27)
under a 12–22 V driving voltage with a maximum current efficiency
of 15.5 cd/A. Furthermore, to gain deep understanding of light outcoupling
mechanisms of OLEDs, a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method
is used to calculate the field intensity distribution of the blue
and red emission,20,21 and the distribution of the optical
characteristics of both the color-tunable and color-stable TOLEDs
is analyzed in detail.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Device Fabrication
Transparent indium
tin oxide (ITO)-coated glasses with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω/sq
were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, deionized water,
and isopropanol for 15 min. After drying in an oven (80 °C),
the ITO glasses were treated with UV/ozone (SunMonde, UV-O3 Cleaner, 40 W, Shanghai, China) for 15 min before loading into the
vacuum chamber. Subsequently, ITO glass substrates were transferred
into a high-vacuum evaporation chamber with a basic pressure of less
than 3 × 10–6 Torr to deposit each functional
layer. Figure 1 shows
the schematic diagram of the resulting OLEDs. In blue/red-emitting
unit, 40 nm N,N′-bis-(3-naphthy)-N,N′-biphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine
(NPB) was used as hole-transporting layer. The 30 nm host materials N,N′-dicarbazolyl-4-4′-biphenyl
(CBP) doped with bis[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-pyridyl]picolinate iridium(III)
(FIrpic) acted as blue EML, whereas for red-emitting unit, 30 nm host
material CBP doped with bis(1-phenyisoquionoline)(acetylacetonate)iridium(III)
(Ir(piq)2acac) acted as EML.22 The 30 nm 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) acted as electron-transporting
layer. Red- and blue-emitting units were connected in series via a
planar heterojunction, which consisted of C60 and CuPc.
To modify the energy level of C60 and CuPc, lithium fluoride
(LiF) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) buffers
are introduced, respectively.23 The evaporating
rates of these materials were controlled at 0.1–0.2 nm/s, and
the Al cathode was controlled at 0.5–1 nm/s, respectively.
The active emission area of each OLED was 3 × 3 mm2.

tandem OLED.

2.2 Properties
Characterization
The current
density–voltage-luminance characteristics and EL spectra of
the TOLEDs were simultaneously characterized by a computer-controlled
programmable Keithley model 2400 power source and a Photo Research
PR655 luminance meter/spectrometer in ambient environment. Surface
morphologies were characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM)
(Agilent, AFM 5500) operating in tapping mode. Optical transmittance
and absorption spectra of C60 and CuPc were recorded by
a HITACHI U-3900 UV–vis scanning spectrophotometer. Ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was conducted to characterize
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of organic semiconductors
by a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi ultra-high-vacuum system. The
UPS measurements were performed with an unfiltered He I (hv = 21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp and a total instrumental energy resolution
of 100 meV.

2.3 Optical Modeling and Simulation
Optical
simulation was conducted using the FDTD simulation (Lumerical FDTD
Solutions 8.17.1157) with a trial license to calculate the field intensity
distributions (including near-field Poynting vector distribution)
in the devices. In the optical modeling, frequency-dependent refractive
index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of ITO, C60, CuPc, and emitting unit were experimentally
determined by the VUV-VASE Ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Co., Inc.) and
then the Al cathode and glass were fitted with the complex refractive
index in the FDTD simulation.24

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Electrical Properties of
C60/CuPc
IMU
One important issue in tandem OLEDs is the effective
charge injection and good transport for the intermediate connector.25 According to previous research works, an optimizing
thickness of C60/CuPc IMU is used in tandem OLED.23,34 To further investigate the role of C60/CuPc IMU between
two emitting units, we examined the charge-generation, charge-injection,
and transport characteristics of the intermediate unit. To clearly
elucidate the ability of charge generation and charge injection in
the LiF/C60/CuPc/MoO3 IMU, we fabricated the
charge-generation-only devices (B-1, B-2, and B-3). The detailed layer
structures of the B-series devices are shown in Table 1. As shown in Figure 2a, in device B-1 (without C60/CuPc
IMU), current density under a forward bias of 10 V is 5.7 × 10–4 mA/cm2, indicating that a huge charge-transport
barrier exists in device B-1. On the other hand, the current response
in device B-2 is 16.4 mA/cm2 at a forward bias of 12 V,
whereas in device B-3, the introduction of an ultrathin LiF layer
between Bphen and C60, along with a thin layer of MoO3 in between CuPc and NPB, greatly enhances the device current
to 24.5 mA/cm2 under the bias of 12 V. This indicates that
the generated electrons in the IMU cannot effectively inject to Bhpen
from C60 in device B-2. Electron-injection barrier between
C60 and Bphen and hole-injection barrier between CuPc and
NPB are effectively repressed by introducing LiF and MoO3, respectively. It is worth noting that the HOMO of CuPc (−5.3
eV) is only 0.1 eV higher than that of NPB (−5.4 eV). Nevertheless,
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60 (−3.88
eV) is 0.98 eV lower than that of Bphen (−2.9 eV), which means
the injection and transportation of holes are better than those of
electrons. According to previous reports, the presence of an ultrathin
LiF-modifying layer can decrease the energy barrier at organic/organic
interfaces via tunneling.26,27 To confirm this possible
mechanism, UPS measurements were further performed. Figure 2b shows the spectra acquired
for C60 and C60 with an ultrathin LiF (1 nm).
The Ecutoff was defined by the crosspoint
of the linear exploration of the high-binding-energy cutoffs and the
straight background line in the spectrum,28 and the Eonset is referred to as the
binding energy onset.29 From Figure 2b, the Ecutoff of C60 and C60/LiF are 17.63 and
17.69 eV, respectively, and the corresponding Eonset values are 2.78 and 2.62 eV. The HOMO energies are obtained
from the following equation30 1  where hv is 21.22 eV. Consequently,
the calculated HOMO energies are −6.37 eV (bare C60) and −6.15 eV (C60/LiF), respectively. According
to the optical gaps (2.49 eV for C60 and 2.56 eV for C60/LiF) obtained from the UV–vis absorption spectra
(Figure 2c), the LUMO
energy levels are estimated to be −3.88 eV for pristine C60 and −3.59 eV for C60/LiF. The optical
band gap of C60 and C60/LiF was estimated according
to the equation31,32 2  where α is the extinction
coefficient
of C60 and a is a constant. The variation
in LUMO energy levels between C60 with and without LiF
indicates that LiF can fine-tune the LUMO of C60, but there
is still a charge barrier of 0.69 eV between C60/LiF and
Bphen.

3.2 Performance Analysis in
Tandem OLEDs with
IMU
Consequently, two tandem OLED devices (A-1 and A-2) based
on different sequence of emitting units were fabricated, as shown
in Table 2. In these
devices, C60/CuPc IMU was employed as the charge-generation
layer between two emitting units (blue and red). These two separated
emitting units with complementary colors might lead to white OLED.12,13 As shown in Figure 3a, when the red-emitting unit is laid adjacent to the anode ITO and
the blue-emitting unit was close to the cathode Al, a superior color
stability can be obtained in device A-1. The EL spectra of the present
devices turn out to be exceedingly stable within the investigated
voltage ranges (12–22 V). More specifically, peak emission
at 496 nm with a shoulder at 476 nm is from FIrpic emission,33 whereas another peak emission at 632 nm with
a shoulder at 672 nm is from Ir(piq)2acac.34 Driven by the investigated voltage range (12–22
V), the CIE coordinates of device A-1 kept at (0.31, 0.27), which
are close to the standard white CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). Nevertheless,
when the red- and blue-emitting units switched position, the red-emitting
unit is adjacent to the cathode Al. Although blue-emitting unit was
close to the anode ITO, color-tunable property was observed in device
A-2. Similar to device A-1, a peak emission at 456 nm with a shoulder
at 476 nm is from FIrpic emission and another peak emission at 628
nm with a shoulder at 668 nm is from Ir(piq)2acac. As shown
in Figure 3b, device
A-2 initially shows a predominantly red emission spectrum at (0.63,
0.31) with 10.3 cd/m2 at 10 V, when then turns orange at
(0.48, 0.29) with 1102 cd/m2 at 16 V. Finally, it becomes
white at (0.34, 0.27) with 15 774 cd/m2 at 22 V.

Typically, TOLEDs have a stacked architecture of multiple
emitting
units with intermediate layers between adjacent emitting units, which
means that each emitting unit can work independently. As described
above, combining the blue-emitting unit with red-emitting unit can
achieve a color-stable white OLED in device A-1, whereas the emission
spectrum of device A-2 can be tuned to be any linear superposition
of red and white light emission by varying the driving voltage. As
both devices A-1 and A-2 are fabricated by identical materials, the
reason of this color-stable and color-tunable variation can be attributed
to the different relative positions of the two emitting units. As
motioned above, the charge barrier between C60 and Bphen
is larger than that between CuPc and NPB, which means that the injection
and transportation of holes are superior to those of electrons. Therefore,
the emitting unit adjacent to the CuPc side may get more carriers
than the emitting unit adjacent to C60. When two emitting
units are biased under the same voltage, the emitting unit adjacent
to the CuPc side can realize a better balance of hole/electron carriers
than the emitting unit adjacent to C60. Another important
factor that may make some influences is the effects of fundamental
EL mechanisms on host–guest system: the host–guest energy
transfer and direct exciton formation. On the one hand, different
triplet energy level (ET) of doping and
host material can affect the energy transfer. The ET of FIrpic (2.62 eV) is slightly higher than that of
CBP host (2.56 eV),35 whereas the ET of Ir(piq)2acac (2.0 eV) is lower
than that of CBP host,36 leading to a more
efficient energy transfer from CBP to Ir(piq)2acac than
to FIrpic.37 On the other hand, according
to the J–V curves of carrier-only
devices with and without dopants in Figure S1, the red-emitting unit can directly trap more carriers to form excitons,
leading to a higher EL intensity than blue unit. Furthermore, by fabricating
two single-emitting unit devices and comparing the EL intensity at
the same voltage (Figure S2), we find that
the efficiency of exciton utilization of Ir(piq)2acac is
higher than that of FIrpic. On the basis of the above-mentioned reasons
of device structure and organic material, when the red-emitting unit
with Ir(piq)2acac is adjacent to C60 (device
A-1), the charge barrier between C60 and Bphen will limit
the number of injected electrons from IMU to red-emitting unit at
low voltage. This difference in injection ability will lead to less
excitons in the red-emitting unit. Although the blue-emitting unit
can obtain more excitons, it is limited by the inefficient energy
transfer from CBP host to FIrpic. In contrast, a more efficient energy
transfer from CBP to Ir(piq)2acac leads to better utilization
of triplet energy excitons, contributing to a sufficient strength
and complementing with blue emission to get white emission. So, with
increasing voltage, both blue and red emission intensities remained
almost identical. As a consequence, device A-1 can attain a color-stable
white emission.

When blue-emitting unit with FIrpic is adjacent
to C60 (device A-2), the working mode of color-tunable
device can be divided
into three steps: (1) At low voltage (from 10 to 12 V), not only the
charge-generation barrier between C60 and Bphen, but also
the inefficiency energy transfer from CBP host to FIrpic will limit
the intensity of blue emission. Therefore, the intensity of red emission
is much higher than that of the blue emission, and the resultant of
mixing emission exhibits a red color with the CIE coordinates (0.63,
0.31). (2) As the driving voltage continues to increase (from 12 to
18 V), more and more electrons can overcome the charge barrier, which
leads to a great increasing in intensity of blue emission. For example,
when applying a voltage of 16 V, the blue emission is enhanced, which
shifts the CIE coordinates from near (0.63, 0.31) to (0.48, 0.29),
as shown in Figure 3b. (3) At the highest voltage (from 18 to 22 V), the device shows
white emission arising from comparable blue and red emission intensities,
as the blue intensity is gradually enhanced with increased voltage.

The EL performances of devices A-1 and A-2 are shown in Figure 4 and summarized in Table 3. The turn-on voltage
of device A-1 is 8.4 V, which is higher than that of device A-2 (7.7
V). Therefore, the structure of device A-2 has a higher charge-transfer
ability than that of device A-1. At a brightness of 10 000
cd/m2, the operating voltage of device A-2 (20.9 V) is
lower than that of device A-1 (21.7 V). C60/CuPc IMU possesses
similar conductivity in both devices, indicating that the order of
emitting units can achieve a better charge injection in A-2. The current
density–voltage–brightness characteristics are displayed
in Figure 4a. Device
A-1 has operational current densities of 1.65, 14.98, and 194 mA/cm2 at luminances of 100, 1000, and 10 000 cd/m2, respectively. To get the same luminance, device A-2 with C60/CuPc as photovoltaic IMU exhibits lower current densities
of 0.80 mA/cm2 (100 cd/m2), 4.91 mA/cm2 (1000 cd/m2), and 68.4 mA/cm2 (10 000
cd/m2), respectively. Figure 4b,c shows the luminance–current efficiency–external
quantum efficiency (L–CE–EQE) and luminance–power
efficiency (L–PE) characteristics of OLEDs.
From Figure 4b and Table 3, we can see that
the current efficiency is enhanced from 15.2/12.9/8.8 (cd/A) in device
A-2 to 20.3/17.7/13.8 (cd/A) in device A-1 at 100/1000/10 000
(cd/m2), respectively. According to the definition of current
efficiency, the brightness of device A-2 is higher than that of device
A-1 for an identical current density. Moreover, the same enhancement
of EQE is also accomplished as shown in Figure 4b. Furthermore, the maximum efficiencies
are 4.3 lm/W and 15.5 cd/A for device A-1, and 6.2 lm/W and 20.4 cd/A
for device A-2, respectively. As the power efficiency of an OLED is
influenced by current efficiency and driving voltage of OLED, the
enhancement of power efficiency in device A-2 is attributed to the
improvement of current efficiency and the reduction of driving voltage.
Actually, the efficiency of whole device is closely related to the
efficiency of the blue- and red-emitting units, especially the efficiency
of the red-emitting unit. In color-stable OLED, the charge barrier
between C60 and Bphen leads to a difficulty of electronic
injection and transportation. Therefore, the decrease of efficiency
of the red-emitting unit results in a decrease in the whole device
efficiency. By comparing the changes in device performance during
the increase of voltage and the intensity of non-normalized EL spectral
(Figure S3), it can be found that a more
recombination could synchronously happen in both red- and blue-emitting
units with increasing voltage. As a result, the EL spectra of color-stable
device in Figure 3 do
not increase with voltage through normalizing the data of EL intensity.

3.3 Optical Modeling of Devices
To further
analyze the color-tunable and color-stable behaviors of TOLEDs, the
optical modeling calculations of near-field light propagation inside
the devices were conducted by employing the FDTD method. In the optical
simulation, one plane wave source with vertical orientations at two
emission wavelengths is located in different positions (1st and 2nd
emitting units, Figure 6) to study the light propagation in the tandem structure. For accuracy,
the shape features of the contact surface of each functional layer
are determined from the AFM images. As shown in Figure 5, ITO, 1st emitting unit, C60,
and CuPc are deposited sequentially, and the surface and section profile
morphologies of each functional were measured by AFM. The pristine
ITO layer has a root mean square (RMS) of 2.12 nm, when 100 nm emitting
unit is deposited on ITO, which can be smoothed to 1.09 nm. Then,
5 nm C60 is deposited on the emitting unit, and only part
of sublayer can be covered to form some peaks. Finally, 5 nm CuPc
is deposited on C60, which has an RMS of 2.02 nm. We take
this practical morphology feature as the simulation parameter to get
more accurate simulation results. Figure 6 shows the simulated
cross-sectional views of field intensities induced by a plane wave
source with vertical orientation (normal to the substrate) at wavelengths
of 625 nm (Figure 6a,b) and 476 nm (Figure 6c,d). We note that the simulation results qualitatively show
the influence of the location of the red- and blue-emitting units
on the light path. Specifically, the red regions represent the areas
with the greatest field intensities.

contact surface of each
functional layer: (a) ITO, (b) first emitting unit, (c) C60, and (d) CuPc.

TOLEDs with vertical orientation (normal to the substrate) at wavelengths
of 625 nm (a, b) and 476 nm (c, d). The source in the second emitting
unit (a, d) and the first emitting unit (b, c).

As shown in Figure 6a,b, wherever the source of 625 nm is, a good light outcoupling
efficiency
can be obtained. When put the source of 476 nm in the first emitting
unit, as shown in Figure 6c, although a part of internally generated light will be confined
in the ITO layer, there is still enough light intensity distribution
in glass. However, the calculated field distributions in Figure 6d clearly show that
a large portion of internally generated light at 476 nm will be confined
in the emitting unit. By combining the simulation results with the
device structure and performance, light intensity distribution in
glass will affect the outcoupling efficiency, leading to either color
stability or tunability. In color-tunable OLED as device A-2, when
blue-emitting unit is adjacent to C60 and red-emitting
unit is adjacent to CuPc (Figure 6a,c), the same light intensity distribution in glass
indicates that the outcoupling efficiencies of both blue and red emissions
are high. Therefore, the main factor is the relative intensity of
the two different colors, which will then determine the emitting color.
As previously discussed, color tunability is obtained due to the different
charge-injection capacity from IMU to the blue- and red-emitting units.
On the contrary, in color-stable OLED as device A-1, when the red-emitting
unit is adjacent to C60 and the blue-emitting unit is adjacent
to CuPc (Figure 6b,d),
the light outcoupling efficiency of red emission is higher than that
of blue emission. Although the intensity of red emission is restricted
by the energy barrier between the IMU and the emitting unit, the intensity
of the red emission is still higher than that of the blue emission
when the driving voltage is relatively low. Consequently, as shown
in Figure 7, it can
be inferred that the emitting intensity can be changed by not only
adjusting the energy barrier between the IMU and the adjacent emitting
units but also manipulating the position of emitting unit on the light
path to adjust the light outcoupling efficiency.

charge-carrier migration and outcoupling
efficiency on device emission spectral stability: (a) color stability,
(b) color tunability.

4 Conclusions
In summary, color-tunable
and color-stable TOLEDs with C60 and CuPc IMU are realized
by simply switching the relative positions
of the red- and blue-emitting units on the light path. When the blue-emitting
unit is adjacent to C60, a maximum current efficiency of
20.4 cd/A is achieved and various colors tuned from red (0.63, 0.31)
to white at the CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.27). Meanwhile, when the
red-emitting unit is adjacent to C60, the device demonstrates
a stable white (0.31, 0.27) and a maximum current efficiency of 15.5
cd/A. By analyzing the energy level and utilizing optical simulation,
it is found that not only the energy barrier between C60/Bphen and different ET of emitting materials,
but also the outcoupling efficiency will affect the color stability
and tunability. This work demonstrates a promising way to fabricate
color-stable and color-tunable OLEDs by using a simple structure for
both display panels and lighting technology.
