In
this paper, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance of
the less explored polymorph of TiO2, rutile, has been explored,
and its performance has been modified with polyaniline (PANI) wrapping
on the surface. For this purpose, highly crystalline rutile nanorods
have been synthesized without any growth-directing substrates, employing
a hydrothermal treatment. Further, to understand the phase composition
and morphology, the synthesized nanorods and PANI-layered nanorods
have been characterized through various physicochemical methods. The
synthesized rods were implemented as photoanode material for DSSCs
which exhibited a photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.28%
with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC)
of 0.84 V which is highly superior to DSSC with Degussa P25 (PCE =
3.95%) TiO2 nanoparticles. The resultant PCE of the nanorods
was further enhanced to 6.23% on in situ deposition
of PANI which acts as an electron-transporting layer. Introduction
of conducting PANI over the rutile rod was explored as a new concept
to improve the performance of photoanode material besides conventional
TiCl4 treatment or scattering layer deposition.

Introduction
Of late, there has
been a great impetus to design and develop functional
nanomaterials for energy-harvesting applications. Among various existing
technologies, simple construction and low cost have stimulated great
research interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1−3 Since 1991, after the first breakthrough in DSSCs reported by O’Regan
and Grätzel, TiO2 has been identified as the state
of the art photoanode material due to its impressive performance.4 We have been working on various oxide materials
to identify new photoanodes for DSSCs. In this direction, various
metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO, Zn2SnO4, and BaSnO3 have been explored as potential photoanode
materials in DSSCs.5−8 Remarkable efforts have been endeavored to establish effective performance
of TiO2 by better synthesis techniques, phase growth, tuning
of morphology, band gap alignment, doping, making composites, etc.
for various applications. It is worth mentioning that the properties
and performance of TiO2 strictly depend on its crystallographic
phase, morphological pattern, dimensions, and surface properties.1,2,9 Among the three main crystallographic
phases of TiO2, such as anatase, rutile, and brookite,
numerous pioneering reports highlighted the superior performance of
anatase TiO2 as compared to rutile or a less stable brookite
crystal pattern mainly in photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications.10−16 On the contrary, the excellent performance of mixed-phase materials,
namely, Degussa P25 (commercial TiO2), compared to single-phase
anatase TiO2 cannot be ruled out which eventually prompted
us to explore the performance of rutile TiO2 rather than
a conventional anatase photoanode. Rutile TiO2 is often
neglected in many applications compared to the anatase phase due to
several of its unfavorable properties: high-temperature synthesis
technique adopted to produce rutile TiO2 leads to unavoidable
aggregation of the nanocrystals which exerts lower dye loading capacity
and lower charge diffusion coefficient. More positive conduction band
edge potential compared to anatase also declines electron transport
capacity, though there are few controversial reports related to the
position of conduction band edge in rutile TiO2.17,18 On the other hand, compared to anatase, the rutile has striking
advantages like more chemical stability and effective light-scattering
capacity owing to its higher refractive index.19−21 Hence, in recent
years, tailoring rutile TiO2 to enable it as an alternative
photoanode to anatase polymorph in DSSCs has become an interesting
area of research.22−31 Among various morphological patterns, one-dimensional (1D) nanorods
or nanowires have distinctive physicochemical properties in comparison
to random nanoparticles.9 The overall conversion
efficiency of nanoparticles is restricted due to percolation of charge
carriers through grain boundaries, resulting in higher recombination.
On the other hand, when nanorods/nanowires are employed as photoanode
in DSSC applications, their one-dimensional morphology with high aspect
ratio efficiently transports conduction electrons through a direct
central conducting pathway and prevents recombination in the radial
direction. The overall energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs has been
decided by the competition between the electron transport efficiency
through photoanode and recombination of electrons with electrolytes
on the semiconductor electrolyte interface. A photoanode comprised
of 1D morphology exerts superior performance over nanoparticles like
counterparts.32−34 In this paper, we have synthesized rutile nanorods
via a low-temperature hydrothermal process to bypass the disadvantages.
Additionally, its one-dimensional morphology with high aspect ratio
efficiently transports conduction electrons through a direct central
conducting pathway and prevents recombination in the radial direction
which eventually exhibits superior efficiency even compared to P25.10,19,24,29,33 In our earlier studies, we have demonstrated
a better performance for ZnO rods or fiber-like structures of various
other photoanode oxide materials as compared to other morphologies.5,8,35−37 Rutile TiO2 rods exhibit better chemical stability and performance as
a stable photoanode in DSSCs. Out of very rare reports describing
the hydrothermally processed rutile nanorods, in most of the cases
FTO has been used as substrates to grow 1D morphology followed by
post treatment with TiCl4 to achieve better efficiency
in DSSCs.29,30,32,34 For example, Liu et al. (2009) reported 3% power
conversion efficiency of single crystalline rutile nanorods after
modification with TiCl4.38 Lv
et al. (2012, 2013) fabricated densely aligned rutile nanorod arrays
using FTO substrate and achieved a power conversion efficiency of
1.3%, whereas in another report an efficiency of 2.35% has been reported
for unetched TiO2 nanorods.29,31 Template-free
or surfactant-free growth of rod morphology pose a serious challenge
to develop pure TiO2 rutile materials. We have discovered
a facile way to create rod structure by variation of reaction pH and
also by avoiding the usage of surfactants, structure-directing agents,
and/or metal–organic templates. On the other hand, the well-studied
conducting polymer, polyaniline (PANI), has been widely used as an
active component for the photocatalytic, photovoltaic, and photo-electrochemical
device fabrication owing to its unique electrical properties, easy
preparation methods, and eco-friendly nature.39−41 In addition,
the conjugated structure of PANI can capture more photoelectrons,
which in turn can retard the recombination between photoexcitons.
Moreover, the performance of PANI augments the visible-light absorption
and thereby produces more photoelectrons under solar irradiation.
Consequently, it has been thought of worthwhile to implement PANI
as an active component in DSSC devices. There are several reports
using PANI as an active component in photocatalytic application and
as an alternative counter electrode for DSSC fabrication.42−44 The PANI-hybridized metal oxide semiconductor has also been reported
to enhance the efficiency of electron separation and suppress the
photocorrosion.45,46 To improve the optical absorption
of the incident light, an additional overlayer on the nanocrystalline
TiO2 photoanode will enhance the light scattering in DSSCs.
Besides, functional materials having both superior light-scattering
properties and high surface area are also being treated in DSSCs to
improve the incident light absorption.47,48 As a new concept,
electron-transporting layer insertions can be explored as another
way to enhance the efficiency of the photoanode. In this work, the
TiO2 rutile rod has been employed as a photoanode, which
exhibited an overall conversion efficiency of 4.28%, which is higher
than the commercially available anatase-based TiO2, Degussa-P25
(3.95%), using N719 dye as a photosensitizer. Furthermore, cloaking
the rutile nanorod with PANI layers enhanced the conversion efficiency
to 6.23%. An underlying phenomenon for this superior performance was
thoroughly investigated and discussed in the following sections. To
the best of our knowledge, for the first time we coupled rutile nanorods
with PANI as a photoanode in DSSCs as a means to improve the performance
of the cell.

Results and Discussion
In order
to investigate the phase purity of the as-prepared powder,
the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was carried out. Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern
of bare TiO2 nanorod, PANI and PANI deposited TiO2. The patterns show that the diffraction peaks of synthesized powder
resembles with the crystal structure of rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS card no.-78–1510). It is interesting to note here
that XRD pattern for PANI deposited TiO2 rod sample is
almost similar to that of bare TiO2 rod sample. The absence
of any significant peak of PANI in the film may be due to the lower
degree of crystallization of PANI. Raman spectroscopic analysis was
also performed in order to understand the phase formation of synthesized
TiO2 and PANI inserted TiO2, as shown in Figure 1b. The characteristic
sharp Raman bands of TiO2 sample at 443 (Eg)
and 607 cm–1(A1g) and a second-order
phonon (235 cm–1) were recognized for rutile phase
of TiO2. In addition, peaks appeared at 1348 and 1567 cm–1 belonging to the G and D band of the PANI structure.
The ID/IG ratio
of 0.856 confirms the graphitic nature of the deposited PANI. The
case of the PANI-deposited TiO2 sample exhibited characteristic
peaks of rutile TiO2 and PANI simultaneously with a significant
shifting of the peak compared to their bare form. This is indicative
of deposition of PANI leading to interaction with TiO2 at
the surface, resulting in displacement of their characteristic Raman
peaks.

Figure 1 (a) X-ray diffraction pattern and (b) Raman spectra of rutile TiO2, PANI, and PANI–TiO2 samples, respectively.

Further, the FTIR spectra interpretation
also confirms the successful
PANI deposition over TiO2 as shown in Figure. 2a. The weaker vibrational
modes at ∼1313 and 1140 cm–1 represent the
C–N stretching frequency for the aromatic amine nitrogen, and
the amine nitrogen–quinoid ring of the polymeric structure
of PANI exhibited a blue shift, respectively. This result interprets
that a widely conjugated system containing PANI and TiO2 had formed. The broad band in Figure 2a centered at ∼3446 cm–1 corresponds
to the stretching frequency of hydroxyl bonds of adsorbed water on
the TiO2 surface which is significantly reduced after deposition
of PANI. This may be due to the presence of labile surface hydroxyl
groups which are mainly responsible for the PANI deposition over the
surface of the TiO2. The sharp and intense band appeared
at 585 and 480 cm–1 assigned to the characteristic
vibration band for Ti–O–Ti of the rutile structure of
the bond vibration. Figure 2b indicates the UV–vis absorption spectra of the same
sample which exhibits a significant bathochromic shift but resulted
in a wide band between 300 and 600 nm. The absorption band of bare
PANI observed at ∼440 nm indicates leading visible absorption
compared to rutile TiO2 (∼300 nm). Therefore, all
the above analyses strongly recommend successful deposition of PANI
over the bare TiO2 surface. The UV–vis absorption
spectra of the rutile rod TiO2–PANI composite samples
exhibited a broad band between 300 and 600 nm with a significant bathochromic
shift compared to the absorbance of the corresponding single-phase
materials. Compared to this, the P25–PANI composite exhibits
a maximum absorption at ∼320 nm with a weak absorption at ∼462
nm (Figure 2b). The
TEM bright field reveals a randomly directed particle–PANI
composite distribution which could affect the absorption peak and
retain the distinct P25 absorption peak even after the composite formation
(Figure 3). In contrast,
perfect wrapping of rutile nanorods by the PANI layer augmented the
appearance of a broad band between 300 and 600 nm and exhibited a
significant bathochromic shift compared to rutile TiO2 and
PANI (Figure 2b).

Further, the morphology of the TiO2 sample was
investigated
in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) as shown in Figure 3a,b. The bright-field image
of as-synthesized TiO2 exhibited densely packed elongated
nanorods with a length of 300–350 nm and an average width of
13 ± 2 nm as shown in Figure 3a,b. From Figure 3a, it appeared like these rods were laterally self-assembled
to form a bundle-like pattern. In each bundle similar types of nanorods
are tightly held together. The highly crystalline nature of individual
nanorods can be easily observed from the HRTEM images shown in Figure 3c. Two sets of lattice
fringes perpendicular to each other with distances of 0.29 and 0.32
nm can be readily observed corresponding to the d spacings of (001) and (110) reflections of rutile TiO2. It was observed that the nanorods preferentially expose the {110}
low energy facets and grow along the [001] direction. Here, Cl– plays a vital role in the growth of TiO2 grains into nanorods instead of nanoparticles. The Cl– is selectively adsorbed onto the positive polar face of the rutile
{110} planes which restrict the coalescence of TiO2 grains
on this surface and accelerate the growth along the [001] direction,
resulting in the growth of rutile nanorods instead of nanoparticles.
TEM studies on the PANI–TiO2 indicate unflinching
wrapping of PANI on the TiO2 nanorods as shown in Figure 3d,e. Figure 3d (inset) depicts the sheet-like
layer texture of the PANI which was rationally deposited onto the
nanorods to form a PANI–TiO2 composite. Figure 3f exhibits the corresponding
HRTEM image and the FFT pattern at the inset. This interfacial contact
is beneficial for photoelectron transport to improve its performance
in DSSCs. Each bundle of nanorods possesses approximately close dimension
of rods, and the aspect ratio varies between 20 ± 5 as observed
from TEM analysis. Alike rods are laterally self-assembled to form
a bundle-like pattern, and in each bundle they are tightly held together
as they are synthesized without any structure-directing agent or surfactant.
PANI deposited through an in situ process onto the
rutile nanorods wrapped on the 1D surface without compromising rod
dimensions and crystallinity as observed from the TEM images. A bright-field
image of the P25 sample was given in Figure 3g. Besides, PANI deposition was also carried
out for the P25 sample, and the corresponding bright-field image was
given in Figure 3h. Figure 3i shows the corresponding
HRTEM image, and the FFT pattern at the inset indicates the ⟨101⟩
plane having an interplanner distance of 0.35 nm which represents
the anatase phase of the P25 sample.

A thorough X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the
PANI-deposited rutile rod film was undertaken in order to find the
chemical state of the elements present in PANI and TiO2. Figure 4a exhibits
the survey spectrum of the PANI-deposited rutile rod film. The presence
of TiO2 and PANI can be ascertained by observing the binding
energy of the Ti 2p, O 1s, C 1s, and N 1s core-level XPS spectrum
as shown in Figure 4b–e. The XPS peaks at 464.6 and 458.8 eV shown in Figure 4b are attributed
to the binding energies of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 states with a spin–orbit separation of 5.8 eV, confirming
the presence of characteristic Ti4+ in the sample. Figure 4c represents the
high-resolution O 1s spectrum. By deconvolution, the observed three
peaks correspond to Ti–O–Ti (530.1 eV), Ti–O–NH/Ti–O–CH
(530.5 eV), and Ti–O–H (531.5 eV), respectively.14 The carbon signal of the PANI-modified surface
of TiO2 comprises four components at 284.4, 285.3, 286.1,
and 288.6 eV as shown in Figure 4d, corresponding to aromatic C=C/C–C,
C–N/C=N, C–O, and Ti–O–CH bonding,
respectively. The peaks at 401.7, 399.9, 399, and 397.2 eV in the
XPS core level spectrum of N 1s correspond to protonated amine (−NH2+), protonated imine (=NH+),
amine (−NH−), and imine (=N−) groups,
respectively, as originated from the emeraldine form of PANI. This
indicates successful formation of PANI during the in situ preparation as shown in Figure 4(e). Throughout the XPS spectrum analysis it has been
observed that the bonding between TiO2 and PANI has been
attributed to hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction as evident
from the core level peaks appearing at 530.5 and 288.6 eV due to significant
bonding interaction of Ti–O–NH/Ti–O–CH
and Ti–O–CH during in situ deposition
of PANI to TiO2. Thus, XPS study of TiO2–PANI
film also explores the intrinsic composite formation between TiO2 and PANI with chemical interaction.49,50

While studying the diffuse reflectance
(DR) spectrum, an interesting
phenomenon was observed as shown in Figure 5a. The rutile TiO2 nanorod exhibits
∼40% reflectance corresponding to ∼300 nm wavelength
due to its 1D nanostructure, whereas deposition of PANI reduced the
extent of reflectance, extending the wavelength toward the visible
region. This result strictly confirms the wrapping of the amorphous
PANI layer on crystalline TiO2 rods, resulting in significant
loss in reflectance. A weak broad reflectance was also observed in
the case of bare PANI at ∼440 nm. However, it is noteworthy
to mention that deposition of PANI onto TiO2 nanorods improves
its solar light-harvesting capacity by extending the wavelength region
which is benevolent for DSSC application. In order to ascertain the
effect of PANI incorporation to develop the TiO2–PANI
composite, the surface area and porosity measurements were executed
for native TiO2 and TiO2–PANI samples
(Figure 5(b)). BET-specific
surface area analysis of synthesized TiO2 and PANI-deposited
TiO2 samples revealed a surface area of 56.64 and 49.62
m2/g, respectively, as shown in Figure 5b and Table S1. As evident from Figure 5b, the type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop indicates the
mesoporous characteristics of rutile rods. A minor decrease in the
surface area was observed in the case of a PANI-deposited TiO2 sample with a change in the adsorption isotherm from type
IV to type III with mesoporous characteristics. Because of the comparatively
high surface area of the synthesized TiO2, it could adsorb
a larger number of dye molecules on the surface than PANI-deposited
TiO2. All the characterization results support the successful
deposition of PANI onto the TiO2 surface.

Figure 5 (a) DR spectra of the
TiO2 nanorod, PANI, and PANI-deposited
TiO2 sample, (b) BET surface area plot of TiO2 nanorod and PANI-deposited TiO2 samples, and (c) UV–Vis
absorption spectra of initial N719 dye and remaining N719 dye after
adsorption on TiO2 and TiO2–PANI films,
respectively.

In order to study the
dye absorbing capability of the prepared
samples, the UV–Vis absorption experiments were carried out
as shown in Figure 5c. The UV–Vis absorption spectra of the residual dye solution
collected after 24 h adsorption on both the TiO2 and TiO2–PANI films are presented in Figure 5c. The characteristic intensity of the residual
N719 dye solution at 380 and 525 nm appeared lower for TiO2 film than TiO2–PANI film. The amounts of dye adsorbed
per device active area and number of dye molecules attached with TiO2 surface were also estimated by using the absorption spectra
given in Table S1. The dye loading capability
is also related to the surface area and porosity of the sample. Therefore,
due to deposition of the PANI layer on the surface of the rutile rods,
the surface area becomes lesser as evident from Figure 5b, resulting in lesser amount of dye loading
leading to lesser fill factor than bare rutile rods.

Prior to
investigating the photovoltaic performance, the FESEM
microstructural investigation was carried out for TiO2 and
PANI-deposited TiO2 films, as shown in Figure 6a,c. The FESEM cross-sectional
microstructural image of the nanorod-based film exhibited rough surface
of the rod samples as shown in Figure 6b,d, and the corresponding thickness was found to be
∼8.56 and 8.95 μm, respectively. The microstructural
analysis reveals that the electrodes are of nearly uniform thickness
which is an important criterion to exert high efficiency in DSSC performance.
Furthermore, FESEM-EDAX elemental color mapping was also carried out
and aimed to be a suitable technique to validate the presence of PANI
onto the TiO2 as shown for the TiO2–PANI
film as shown in Figure 6c. It shows the coexistence of Ti, C, N, and O belonging to PANI
and TiO2, respectively. This result further confirms the
deposition of PANI onto the TiO2 surface.

TiO2 and (c,d) PANI-deposited TiO2, respectively,
and (e) EDAX color elemental mapping for the following elements: Ti,
O, C, and N of PANI-deposited TiO2 film.

Photovoltaic Application
The photovoltaic
performance of both samples was compared as shown
in Figure 7a,b. The
transient photocurrent response was further investigated which exhibits
higher current density in the case of TiO2–PANI
film compared to the respective bare forms for several cycles with
the on–off pulse duration of 10 s, as exhibited in Figure 7a. This may further
indicate that illumination of light can lead to photocurrent enhancement
of TiO2–PANI film compared to the respective bare
form which indicates deposition of PANI. A comparative plot of J–V characteristics for bare rutile TiO2 and PANI-coated film along with the commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 is shown in Figure 7b, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It was observed
that rutile nanorods exhibited a photoelectric conversion efficiency
(PCE) of 4.28% compared to that of commercial Degussa P25 TiO2 (PCE = 3.95%). It may be due to the unidirectional electron
transport induced by the rod nature without suffering from grain boundaries
compared to P25 nanoparticles irrespective of its anatase/rutile crystal
phase. The rutile rod structure exhibited higher VOC of 0.82 V which is quite impressive in the case of
rutile TiO2-based DSSC devices.51 During PANI insertion the photocurrent density was significantly
improved for both P25 (JSC: 12.63 mA/cm2) and rutile TiO2 (JSC: 14.73 mA/cm2). Furthermore, PANI-coated TiO2 rod based photoanodes exhibited an overall PCE of 6.23% with a significant
improvement of JSC of the DSSC device
(∼62%). This result interprets that PANI helps to accelerate
faster electron mobility and shorter charge recombination of the photoanode
leading to enhanced efficiency. On the contrary, PANI insertion causes
reduction in fill factor to 0.56 from 0.63 which may be due to the
reduction of the TiO2 surface area that is inaccessible
for the dye sensitization, causing steric constraints, and defective
PANI molecule accumulation on the surfaces of TiO2 rod
leads to recombination of photoexcited carriers at higher content
of PANI than optimal conditions.

To understand the charge transport in the DSSC interfaces, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopic studies were performed for TiO2 and PANI–TiO2 devices. The series resistance (RS) represents the lower frequency intercepts
on the real axis. Besides, the second high frequency semicircle represents
the charge transfer resistance originated from the TiO2/N719 dye/I––I3– electrolyte interface (RCT2).5,8 As the counter (Pt) and electrolyte (I–/I3–) used the same for both the samples, our
interest was to study the RCT2 interface
zone for both the devices. Figure 7c shows the impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) and corresponding
equivalent circuit diagram (inset) of cells for TiO2 and
TiO2–PANI devices recorded from 10–2 to 106 Hz, consisting of only two semicircles. As shown
in Figure 7c, both
the devices exhibit close values of RS, 15.36 Ω for bare TiO2 and 14.58 Ω for TiO2–PANI devices, respectively, which is due to the use
of the same Pt counter electrodes and I–/I3– electrolyte in all the devices. Importantly,
the charge transfer resistances, RCT1 and RCT2 of 21.08 Ω and 31.47 Ω, for
the TiO2–PANI device are lower than 23.13 Ω
and 36.62 Ω for bare TiO2 devices, respectively.
This indicates that the PANI-layered nanorod exhibits lower charge
transport resistance than bare TiO2, which leads to minimizing
of the charge recombination and lowering of the interfacial resistance
and therefore better solar cell performance. However, maximum JSC (14.73 mA/cm2) observed for the
composite-based device indicates that deposition of PANI successfully
overruled the reduced surface area related factor by working as an
electron transportation layer onto rutile nanorods along with its
electrochromic performance to boost up the photovoltaic efficiency
of the rutile nanorods. Previously, Zhu et al. (2012) demonstrated
PANI-hybridized ZnO photoanode in DSSC with 60% enhanced efficiency
for the hybridized photoanode.41 As an
influence from that report, we have explored the same mechanism with
rutile TiO2 which also exhibits enhanced efficiency on
PANI insertion on hybridization to the DSSC performance. Comparative
photovoltaic performance of 1D rutile TiO2-based cells
in DSSCs has been summarized in Table 2.

The increase of photocurrent density can be mainly explained by
considering the hybrid effect between TiO2 and PANI as
it may induce the high efficiency of charge separation. Once the dye
absorbs the light and generates photoexcited electrons, the hybridized
PANI layer may promptly conduct them into the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in increasing the electron density on the conduction
band of TiO2. Furthermore, PANI appears like a blanket
on the entire bundle of rods rather than coating individual rods.
Also, it does not influence the morphology or the nature of the rutile
rod distribution and their arrangement. On the basis of photocurrent
measurements, we project PANI-wrapped rutile TiO2 nanorods
as a new type of modified photoanode material. Comparative photovoltaic
performance of 1D rutile TiO2-based cells in DSSCs has
been summarized in Table 2. The characteristics of the electron-transporting layer,
carrier mobility, energy band alignment, morphology, trap states,
and related interfacial properties are major factors to determine
the device behavior and photovoltaic performance of oxide in a solar
cell.52,53

Conclusion
Highly crystalline rutile
nanorods synthesized by a low-temperature
hydrothermal technique wrapped with PANI were explored as alternative
photoanode in a DSSC device which exhibited the photoelectric conversion
efficiency (PCE) of 4.28% and a high VOC of 0.82 V. Furthermore, in situ deposition of polyaniline
(PANI) as an electron-transporting layer onto the surface of nanorods
boosts up the photovoltaic efficiency of the rutile nanorods to 6.23%.
Various physicochemical characterizations established successful deposition
of PANI layers on the TiO2 nanorod. The photoelectrochemical
study also confirms that on illumination PANI enhances the rate of
electron conduction of TiO2 compared to the respective
bare forms. Improving the charge transport on deposition of the PANI
layer over the nanorod surface may open up a new avenue for improving
the efficiency of DSSC devices besides conventional TiCl4 treatment or other conventional scattering layer deposition.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Titanium tetra-isopropoxide ([Ti(OCHMe2)4] 97%, TTIP, AR) and ammonium persulfate ([NH4]2S2O8) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Aniline and hydrochloric acid (37% HCl, EMPARTA) were
purchased from Merck Ltd., India, and used without further purification.

Synthesis of Rutile TiO2 Nanorods
TiO2 nanorods were synthesized using aqueous solution of 1.7 mmol
of TTIP under vigorous stirring for ∼2 h followed by 1 h aging
at room temperature. Concentrated HCl was added proportionately to
keep the solution pH ≤ 1.5. The whole mixture was transferred
into a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and heated
at 160 °C for 5 h and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained
mixture was collected and centrifuged at ∼11 000 rpm
followed by washing with water and ethanol for several times. Subsequently,
the resultant white product was dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven.

Fabrication of TiO2 Film
The TiO2 films
were fabricated by the doctor blading method on fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) (7 Ω/cm2) glass substrate using a
homemade paste of TiO2 with ethyl cellulose and α-terpinol
(Sigma-Aldrich).We used three layers of TiO2 paste to fabricate
the TiO2 photoanode followed by annealing at 450 °C
for 30 min.

Deposition of the Polyaniline (PANI) Layer
on TiO2 Film
PANI was allowed to deposit in situ onto the TiO2 film surface. In detail,
3.24 mL of aniline
hydrochloride solution (0.1 M) and 10 mL of HCl solution (0.1 M) were
mixed in a reaction vessel placed in an ice bath (0–5 °C),
and the mixture was stirred thoroughly to obtain a uniform suspension.
Next, the nonconducting side of the fabricated film was masked with
scotch tape and further dipped inside the solution. An amount of 3.24
mL of ammonium persulfate solution (0.1 M) was dropwise added to the
mixture over 1 h. Further, the solution was allowed to react in an
ice bath for another 2 h. The solution color changed to green accompanied
by a green layer deposition over the TiO2 film, visually
indicating PANI formation. After that, the film was removed from the
solution and repeatedly washed with water until the pH value was adjusted
to ∼7. Finally, the PANI-deposited TiO2 film was
completely dried under an IR lamp for further use.

Material Characterization
The phase evaluation and
purity of the synthesized TiO2 and TiO2–PANI
composite samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction measurements
on an X’pert pro MPD XRD of PANalytical system with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphology evaluation and
crystallinity nature of synthesized TiO2 and TiO2–PANI composite samples were recorded through bright-field
image, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image,
and fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern using a Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI)
Ultra High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope operating at
200 kV. A PerkinElmer, Spectrum two FT-IR spectrometer (with a resolution
of 4 cm–1) was used for the Fourier transformed-infrared
(FT-IR) measurement using potassium bromide (FTIR grade ≥99%,
Sigma-Aldrich). Raman spectroscopic measurement has been performed
on a STR500 (Cornes Technologies system by using 514.5 nm Ar+ green laser with 50 mW power). The surface and cross-sectional image
of bare TiO2 and TiO2–PANI composite
films were recorded using field emission scanning electron microscopy
on a Supra 35VP (Carl Zeiss) Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope
(FESEM) operating at 20 kV. The surface area of both the samples was
obtained using the nitrogen physisorption measurements and the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) method within the relative pressure (p/p0) range of 0.05–0.20, and the pore size
distribution was calculated by the Barret–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method using the Quantachrome (iQ3) instrument after evacuation
at 150 °C for 4 h. The UV absorption spectra and diffused reflectance
spectra were recorded on a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu UV-3600). X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed in a PHI 5000 Versa probe II scanning XPS microprobe
(ULVAC-PHI, U.S.) at room temperature acquired with monochromatic
Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation with a total resolution of about 0.7 eV and
a beam size of 100 μm.

Fabrication of DSSC
For device fabrication,
each film
thickness was maintained at ∼8 μm with an active area
of 0.2826 cm2. The films were soaked in ethanolic solution
of N719 dye (0.5 mM, Solaronix) for a period of 24 h. For electrolyte
preparation, 0.3 M 1-methylbenzimidazole (NMB) was thoroughly mixed
with 1:1 volume ratio acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN)
solution followed by the addition of 0.4 M LiI, 0.4 M tetrabutylammonium
iodide (TBAI), and 0.04 M I2. The entire mixture was stirred
overnight. Pt solutions (Platisol T, BN 40/170311FM, Solaronix, Switzerland)
having Pt particles in the size range of 10–20 nm were drop
casted on a cleaned FTO glass. The deposited layer was gradually air-dried
followed by heating at 450 °C for 15 min, in order to activate
the platinum layer for working. Finally, the prepared I3–/I– liquid electrolyte was infiltrated
into the photoanode cell and made a sandwiched DSSC device with the
Pt counter electrode. Sandwich-type DSSCs were then assembled using
the dye-adsorbed TiO2 film and a Pt electrode with a hot-melt
film (∼25 μm, Surlyn, Dyesol) between them. The photovoltaic
performances of the assembled devices were measured under 1000 W/m2 of light from a Wacom AAA continuous solar simulator (model:
WXS-210S-20, AM1.5G). The I–V characteristic
of the device was recorded using an EKO MP-160i I–V Tracer. The presented data are average measurements done on two
different devices for each sample. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were performed by using an Autolab PGSTAT 10 and
a frequency response analyzer (FRA) module with the frequency range
from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. The devices were measured at the 0.84 V open-circuit
voltage for bare TiO2 and 0.76 V open-circuit voltage for
TiO2–PANI devices. The data were further fitted
using Z-view software (version 3.4d, Scribner Associates, Inc., USA).
