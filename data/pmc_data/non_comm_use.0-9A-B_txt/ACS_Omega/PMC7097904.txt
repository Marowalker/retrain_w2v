Introduction
Development and improvement
of analytical methods for assuring
quality and authenticity of vegetable oils are very important research
axes in the food field. In particular, the objectives of empowering
detection and fostering prevention of oil fraud are considerably supported
by European Union’s research and innovation programs.1 On the basis of the expanding market for vegetable
oils, their authenticity has become an important subject from both
commercial and health point of view.2,3 Among all vegetable
oils, the extra virgin olive oil is known to have the highest economical
value.4 At the same time, rapeseed, soyabean,
and palm oils are the cheapest ones available in the market and can
be used to ‘bulk-out’ more expensive products. Thus,
the analytic methods resolving the problem of oil adulteration as
well as determining origin, quality, and oxidative stability of oils
are continuously under intensive development.

The main instrumental
approaches of oil analysis include different
methods of chromatography and mass spectrometry, as well as their
combination, such as: high-resolution gas chromatography, high-performance
liquid chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography, stable
isotope ratio mass spectrometry, chemical ionization mass spectrometry,
and so forth.5−7 In addition, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,8 differential scanning calorimetry,9 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy,10−12 fluorescence spectroscopy,13,14 and DNA-analysis instruments12,15 are also widely applied
for investigation of vegetable oils.

Most of the conventional
methods cited above consist of time-consuming,
expensive, and complex set-ups and technological procedures. Some
of them use toxic chemicals and solvents. Therefore, development of
innovative, cheap, and efficient sensor-based concepts is of primary
importance.16 In order to improve efficiency
of the oil detection, novel sensing components are investigated, for
instance, microwave sensing interdigitated electrodes17 or a fiber optic long period grating-based sensor.18 Nevertheless, the most promising results are
obtained with multisensor platforms exploiting the concept of electronic
nose and tongue. For example, electronic noses based on metal oxide
semiconductors,19−21 conducting polymers,22−24 quartz crystal microbalances,25,26 and detectors of surface acoustic wave27,28 were applied for differentiation of vegetable oils. As for the electronic
tongues, they are mainly based on voltammetric measurements in electrochemical
cells29−32 or potentiometric sensor arrays.33−37

Our research team has recently developed a
special electronic tongue
system based on optoelectronic measurements with use of silicon wafers.38 In particular, we have shown its successful
application for the recognition of water and spirits. This kind of
electronic tongue is an inexpensive and environmental friendly combinatorial
electronic sensing platform that is able to record characteristic
electronic fingerprints of liquids resulted from their interaction
with either naturally aged or specifically treated silicon substrates.
In this letter, we report an application of the silicon-based optoelectronic
tongue for recognition of vegetable oils and their mixtures.

Results
and Discussion
Our sensing approach is based on measuring
of minority carrier
lifetime in silicon by using a microwave-detected photoconductance
decay as shown in Figure 1. A pulse of infrared (IR) laser (904 nm) generates free electron–hole
pairs under illuminated area close to the front surface of a silicon
wafer (penetration depth of the laser radiation in silicon is about
30 μm). Because the free electrons and holes recombine, their
concentration and, consequently, conductivity of the silicon sample
decreases exponentially in time after the action of the exciting light
pulse. The decaying conductivity can be monitored by detecting microwave
reflectivity ensured by the photogenerated free charge carriers as
a function of time. The measured reflectivity decay is fitted with
an exponential curve, and the obtained time constant (τmeas) corresponds to the effective lifetime of the photocreated
charge carriers in the given position of the silicon sample. Changing
the illuminated zone of the studied sample allows the creation of
its 2D map in terms of the lifetime values τmeas,
which depend on silicon parameters and its surface chemistry. If a
silicon sample is put in an intimate contact with a chemical substance
(e.g., liquid), a new τmeas map induced by the substance
molecules interacting electronically with the silicon surface will
be obtained. Thus, one can establish a correlation between a surface
distribution of the τmeas values obtained for the
given substance/silicon interface and chemical composition of the
liquid substance.

Figure 1 Basic physical principles used in the optoelectronic tongue:
(a)
generation of free electron–hole pairs near the silicon surface
under absorption of IR laser pulse; (b) dependence of microwave reflectivity
on concentration of the free charge carriers; (c) modulation of surface
band bending by analyte–silicon interaction and applied voltage
bias; (d) time-resolved photoconductivity decay due to recombination
of the generated electron–hole pairs as a function of surface
band bending.

To increase reliability of liquid
recognition, one can additionally
record a set of τmeas maps by polarizing the liquid/silicon
interface as it is schematically shown in Figure 1. Indeed, continuous tuning of the difference
of electric potentials Vb applied to the
interface will ensure modulation of the electronic bands bending in
the near-surface region of the silicon substrate. The voltage dependent
band bending leads to refilling of interface electronic states and
significant voltage-induced modulation of the lifetime maps formed
by the studied liquid sample onto the silicon surface.

A typical
Si-based structure used in this work is schematically
represented in Figure 2. A half of the structure was covered with an ultrathin SiNX layer (10–15 nm). The SiNX films are well-known to be widely used in the industrial silicon
solar cell fabrication process.39 Indeed,
chemical composition of the SiNX layers
ensures an excellent electronic passivation of various defects localized
at the surface of bulk silicon substrates.40 As a result, lifetime of charge carriers photogenerated in Si substrates
covered with a SiNX layer increases significantly.
One can compare 2D maps of the τmeas values obtained
for the Si samples covered with SiNX layers
deposited at various silane-to-ammonia gas flow ratios R = SiH4/NH3. As shown in Figure 3A, the higher the R value
is, the higher the corresponding lifetimes (τmeas) values are. In particular, the τmeas value (about
30 μs) obtained for the Si-rich SiNX layers deposited at R5 is much higher than the τmeas value for a bare Si surface (5 μs), for example.

Figure 2 Typical Si–Si/SiNX sensitive
structure used in this work. A half of the structure is covered with
an ultrathin (non continuous) SiNX layer
passivating the silicon surface and characterized by increased lifetimes
of photogenerated charge carriers.

Figure 3 (A) Characteristic
lifetimes of a bare Si substrate and Si substrates
covered by SiNX films obtained at various
silane-to-ammonia gas flow ratios (R). (B) Impact
of water molecules on the 2D τmeas map of a Si–Si/SiNX substrate. (C) 2D τmeas maps of a Si–Si/SiNX substrate
put in contact with almond, rape, and hazelnut oils at different polarizing
voltages Vb.

In our work, extremely low deposition time (about 10–20
s) of the SiNX layers was used in order
to avoid complete capping of the silicon surface by a continuous film
of silicon nitride (as sketched in Figure 2). This is especially important to allow
the studied liquids to get at least partial access to the Si surface
semipassivated by the SiNX films. Indeed,
being able to penetrate through the numerous subnanometer pores, grooves
and/or gaps present in the SiNX ultrathin
layers, the studied liquid will modulate significantly the initial
lifetime values measured in air. As one can see in Figure 3B, water molecules influence
strongly the τmeas map of a Si sample having two
regions: (i) the bare Si surface and (ii) the SiNX ultrathin layer deposited on the Si substrate at R3. In general,
the lifetime values are considerably enhanced for the both regions
exposed to water. After water removal, the 2D distribution of the
τmeas values was completely reset.

To demonstrate
high applicative potential of the optoelectronic
tongue for the oil recognition purpose, a set of various oil samples
has been used. The most representative 2D τmeas maps
of the photoelectric fingerprints created by almond, rape, and hazelnut
oils on the Si–Si/SiNX sensitive
structures at 0 and ±6 V of the voltage bias Vb are shown in Figure 3C. Here, positive sign of the voltage corresponds to
accumulative band bending of the p-type silicon wafer. As one can
see, the most important difference between the τmeas maps formed by the studied oils corresponds to Vb = −6 V. Thus, one could use this Vb value for rapid qualitative recognition of the tested
oils. At this value of the polarizing voltage (−6 V), the most
pronounced electronically passivating impact on the silicon surface
is provoked by almond oil, while distribution of the τmeas values (17–22 μs) in the Si/SiNX region remains almost insensitive to the oil samples. In particular,
almost no difference between the τmeas values for
both Si and Si/SiNX regions can be observed
for the case of the rape oil polarized at Vb = −6 V. As for the inhomogeneity of lifetime distribution
over the sample surface, which was observed for water, is almost negligible
for the all the studied oil samples. Indeed, a slight distribution
of the lifetimes within a given zone is much less than the changes
of the lifetimes for various oils exposed to various voltages.

At the same time, the most significant voltage-induced evolution
of the recorded τmeas maps corresponds to the interface
between the Si–Si/SiNX substrates
and almond oil. The evolution kinetics is extremely slow. Once a voltage
value is set, the corresponding voltage-induced changes of a τmeas map can take up to 30 min. Finally, it is worth to note
complete reversibility of the initial 2D τmeas maps
in air after the washing out of the oil samples. Indeed, as one can
see in Figure S1 (shown in the Supporting
Information), the τmeas maps recorded in air after
each exposition of the Si–Si/SiNX substrate to an oil sample are identical and correspond to the map
of the original substrate before its first use.

To ensure a
high discrimination capability level of the proposed
sensing system, the data can be visualized in more illustratable manner.
In our work, principal component analysis (PCA) method was applied.41 This multivariate analysis approach enables
to find a set of linearly uncorrelated variables so that the first
has maximum variance, and each next variable is orthogonal to the
previous and has maximum possible variance with this constraint. This
method is widely used for dimension reduction because most of the
information is concentrated in the first components and commonly employed
in various combinatorial platforms for discrimination purposes.42−44 As a result, Figure 4A shows a plot of three first principal components (with corresponding
scores of 26.8% for the first principal component, 22.6% for the second
principal component, and 14.7% for the third one) containing clouds
of points for each of the tested oils. In particular, because the
distance between the points reflects their nonsimilarity, clear clustering
of the data illustrates a perfect degree of discrimination capability
of our analytical system to recognize among the studied oils. With
only two kinds of regions (bare Si and Si covered with SiNX islands) and three values of the polarizing voltage Vb (0 and ±6 V), we are already able to
observe a significant degree of discrimination between the different
oils. Natural small variation of the lifetimes within a single zone
is taken into account and reflected by distance between the points
at the PCA diagram in Figure 4A for each oil sample. Because of the distance between the
points within the same cloud is less than the distances between the
clouds, the recognition of the oil samples can be evaluated as a reliable
one.

Figure 4 (A) 3D PCA plot corresponding to the electronic fingerprints of
the tested oils formed on the Si–Si/SiNX substrate at different polarizing voltages Vb. (B) 2D PCA plot corresponding to the electronic fingerprints
of olive and rape oils as well as their mixtures. The units of the
principal components on the axes are microseconds.

Virgin olive oil possessing unique qualities is highly appreciated
by consumers because of its exceptional nutritional, medicinal, cosmetic,
and even ceremonial value. As a result, it is one of the most expensive
and also one of the most adulterated food products. In particular,
its adulteration with low-grade olive oils or cheaper vegetable oils
(e.g., such as rape oil) could potentially be very profitable for
sellers or raw material suppliers and may yield large economic profits.
Thus, authentication of virgin olive oils has become an interesting
subject from both commercial and health perspectives. Figure 4B demonstrates the ability
of the optoelectronic tongue based on the Si–Si/SiNX sensitive structures described in this letter to
recognize mixtures of olive and rape oils. Indeed, Figure 4B shows a plot of two first-principal
components (with corresponding scores of 67.7% for the first principal
component and 16.6% for the second principal component) containing
points for initial pure olive and rape oils as well as their mixtures
(all samples measured three times). The first mixture (1:9) was selected
as a minimal (from commercial view point) amount of rapeseed added
to olive oil. The second mixture (1:1) is intermediate between the
pure rapeseed and olive oils. As one can see, the cloud corresponding
to the olive oil with 10% of rape oil is clearly different from the
cloud related to the sample of the pure olive oil. It is worth noting
that the cloud corresponding to the 50% mixture of the oil samples
is localized on the PCA plot in the middle between the clouds corresponding
to the pure oils.

The described approach is based on a holistic
measurement approach.
Indeed, a complex and simultaneous impact of all oil components forms
the sensor signal in each zone. In other words, all the molecules
constituting the given oil physically impact the electronic surface
states initially governed by the surface chemistry of each zone (bare
c-Si or SiNX film) and by bias voltage.
Unlike other known sensing systems, specific sensitive materials and
components are not necessary to be used. Moreover, certain chemical
indicators are not determined, such as peroxide value, concentration
of additives, etc. Even so, our optoelectronic tongue is able to distinguish
different classes of oils and their mixtures using PCA.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the optoelectronic tongue based on the Si–Si/SiNX substrates can be efficiently applied for
a label-free and nonspecific recognition of vegetable oils. In particular,
the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers is confirmed to be
an extremely efficient physical parameter ensuring high sensitivity
of silicon-based structures to play a role of an electronic screen
reflecting the complex physicochemical interaction between the bare
or partially covered silicon surface and the studied chemical substance.
This specific kind of electronic tongues is an inexpensive and environmental
friendly combinatorial electronic-sensing platform that is able to
create characteristic electronic fingerprints of liquids, detect,
and recognize them.
