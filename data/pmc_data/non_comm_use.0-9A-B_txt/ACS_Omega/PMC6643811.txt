A dendritic
multinuclear Ir complex, namely Cz–3IrB–IrG,
has been designed and synthesized by introducing the second-generation
oligocarbazole dendrons into its periphery. Because of the characteristic
encapsulation, the intermolecular interactions could be effectively
alleviated to prevent the unwanted triplet–triplet annihilation
stemmed from the outer blue Ir complexes. Compared with 3IrB–IrG
in the absence of dendrons, the film photoluminescence quantum yield
of Cz–3IrB–IrG is greatly increased from 0.46 to 0.82
together with a small blue-shifted emission from 524 to 520 nm. On
the basis of Cz–3IrB–IrG as the emitting layer alone,
the nondoped device realizes a promising luminous efficiency of 40.9
cd/A (12.0%), much higher than that of 3IrB–IrG (32.6 cd/A,
9.7%). The obtained improvement clearly indicates that further dendronization
toward multinuclear Ir complex will provide an alternative strategy
to construct highly efficient phosphors used for nondoped phosphorescent
organic light-emitting diodes.

1 Introduction
Nondoped
(also known as host-free) phosphorescent organic light-emitting
diodes (PhOLEDs) have simultaneously received much academic interest
besides doped ones, where the emitting layer (EML) is composed of
a single phosphor without any additional host.1−3 In this case,
the delicate and exact control of the ratio between different components
is not required to constitute the EML any longer, beneficial for the
device reliability and reproducibility.4 Furthermore, the potential phase separation existing in doped devices
could be avoided to improve the device stability during long-term
operation.5 Given these advantages, many
efforts should be paid for the development of efficient phosphors
capable of nondoped PhOLEDs.

As for the conventional phosphors,
the severe triplet–triplet
annihilation (TTA) in solid states is believed to mainly limit their
applications in nondoped PhOLEDs.6 Therefore,
nowadays several molecular design rules have already been exploited
to dampen the TTA effect and increase the nondoped device efficiency:
(i) incorporating the electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., −F
and −CF3) or bulky groups (e.g., tert-butyl, phenyl,
triphenylsilyl, fluorenyl, and carbazolyl) into the ligand to modulate
intermolecular interactions;7−10 (ii) encapsulating a phosphorescent core with functional
dendrons to form a so-called self-host feature;11,12 and (iii) utilizing specific emissive mechanisms including metal–metal-to-ligand
charge transfer and excimer.13−17 Among them, phosphorescent dendrimers seem to be more attractive
because of easy functionality of core and peripheral dendrons independently
as well as intrinsic solution processability. In fact, based on such
phosphorescent dendrimers, highly efficient nondoped PhOLEDs are realized
showing emission colors in the whole visible region.18−22

Recently, we have put forward an alternative strategy, namely
multinucleation,
toward nondoped phosphors.23 The issued
tetranuclear iridium (Ir) complex 3IrB–IrG possesses a characteristic
self-host feature similar to phosphorescent dendrimers (Figure 1), where the three outer blue
Ir complexes can act as the host for the one inner green Ir core.
In addition, the corresponding nondoped device achieves an appealing
luminous efficiency as high as 32.6 cd/A. It is noteworthy that, in
3IrB–IrG, TTA still exists between the outer blue complexes
although they can protect the inner green complex from interacting
with each other. Thereby, an unwanted energy loss may occur during
the outside-in energy transfer, leading to the relatively low photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY) of 3IrB–IrG. To solve this problem, here,
we report a dendritic multinuclear Ir complex Cz–3IrB–IrG
by introducing the second-generation oligocarbazole dendrons into
the surrounding of 3IrB–IrG. Benefiting from the encapsulation
effect, the intermolecular interactions and thus TTA stemmed from
the outer blue Ir complexes could be prohibited indeed, so that the
PLQY is significantly enhanced from 0.46 of 3IrB–IrG to 0.82
of Cz–3IrB–IrG. As a consequence, the nondoped device
with Cz–3IrB–IrG as the EML achieves an enhanced luminous
efficiency of 40.9 cd/A (12.0%) compared with that of 3IrB–IrG
(32.6 cd/A, 9.7%).

and with

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization
The
synthetic route for Cz–3IrB–IrG is presented in Scheme 1. Similar to our
previous work,23 a postdendronization method
was adopted here to convergently construct the dendritic multinuclear
Ir complex. Starting from the bromo-substituted oligocarbazole dendron
(Cz–Br) and blue Ir complex containing three reactive hydroxyl
groups (IrB–OH), a quantitative Williamson reaction was performed
to afford the key intermediate (Cz–IrB–OH) by controlling
the feed ratio. There was one remaining hydroxyl group in Cz–IrB–OH,
which could be further brominated in the next step and finally contributed
to the target complex Cz–3IrB–IrG through reacting with
the three-hydroxyl-containing green Ir complex (IrG–OH). The
molecular structure of Cz–3IrB–IrG was fully characterized
by 1H NMR, 19F NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI–TOF), and element analysis.
Also, it is well-soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane,
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, toluene, and so on, ensuring the good
film-forming capability via solution processing.

Dendritic Multinuclear Ir Complex Cz–3IrB–IrG
Reagents and conditions: (i)
Cs2CO3, DMF, 70 °C and (ii) 1,4-dibromobutane,
Cs2CO3, DMF, 70 °C.

2.2 Photophysical Properties
Figure 2a depicts the absorption
and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in solutions for Cz–3IrB–IrG
with 3IrB–IrG as the control. Consistent with the literature,23 the absorption bands below 325 nm are ascribed
to the spin-allowed ligand-centered transitions, whereas the weak
bands in the range of 325–500 nm are assigned to the metal-to-ligand
and ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer transitions. Compared with the
3IrB–IrG, the sharp enhancement of the absorption coefficient
below 325 nm for Cz–3IrB–IrG is reasonable from the
incorporation of the peripheral oligocarbazole dendrons. Meanwhile,
both Cz–3IrB–IrG and 3IrB–IrG exhibit almost
the same emission mainly from the inner green Ir complex (λem = 512 nm) accompanied by a residue from the outer blue Ir
complex (λem = 467 nm). This is due to the nonconjugated
linkage between oligocarbazole dendrons and multinuclear Ir complexes,
guaranteeing the independent electronic behaviors of each fragment.
On going from solutions to films, the residual blue emission is completely
quenched (Figure 2b),
indicative of both intra- and intermolecular energy transfer. In addition,
the emission maximum moves toward a shorter wavelength from 524 nm
of 3IrB–IrG to 520 nm of Cz–3IrB–IrG. The observed
hypsochromic shift can be explained when considering the reduced intermolecular
interactions after the introduction of the surrounding oligocarbazole
dendrons.

Figure 2 (a) UV/vis spectra in dichloromethane and PL spectra in toluene;
(b) PL spectra in neat films for Cz–3IrB–IrG compared
with 3IrB–IrG.

To investigate the shielding effect on TTA, the transient
PL spectra
in films were also measured by exciting the samples with a 355 nm
light pulses and detecting the emission peaks of the outer blue and
inner green complexes, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 3, the lifetime of the inner
green Ir complex in Cz–3IrB–IrG is prolonged to 0.80
μs compared to that in 3IrB–IrG (0.35 μs), confirming
the reduced intermolecular interactions and thus luminescence quenching.
On the other hand, the outer blue Ir complexes in Cz–3IrB–IrG
are found to decay much slower (τav = 0.13 μs)
than that in 3IrB–IrG (0.05 μs). Because of the dendrons’
encapsulation, TTA between the outer blue Ir complexes is anticipated
to be prevented effectively. Consequently, the energy loss induced
by TTA could be avoided, which contributes to the enhancement of the
inner core’s emission. For example, the PLQY of Cz–3IrB–IrG
in thin film is determined to be 0.82, about 1.8-fold that of 3IrB–IrG
(0.46). Finally, the PL spectra and PLQYs of the doping films of Cz–3IrB–IrG
in the host H224 were also investigated.
When the doping concentration is up from 5 to 100 wt % (Figure S4 and Table S1), a slight red shift of 6 nm is observed for the emission maximum
together with the small variation of the corresponding PLQYs in the
range of 0.82–0.92. The observation indicates again that the
peripheral oligocarbazole dendrons could provide an effective encapsulation
toward the multinuclear Ir complex (Table 1).

3IrB–IrG in thin films. The above plot is aimed to study the
emissive behavior of the inner green Ir complex, whereas the below
plot is drawn to analyze the emissive behavior of the outer blue Ir
complex.

f Detected at 484 and 520 nm, respectively.

2.3 Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
properties of 3IrB–IrG and Cz–3IrB–IrG were studied
by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Figure 4, three quasi-reversible oxidation processes
are observed for Cz–3IrB–IrG during the anodic sweep.
With respect to 3IrB–IrG, the first and second waves are from
the inner and outer Ir complexes, respectively, whereas the third
one is aroused by the oxidation of the oligocarbazole dendrons. However,
during the cathodic sweep, similar reduction processes occur for both
3IrB–IrG and Cz–3IrB–IrG because the reduction
of the oligocarbazole dendrons is unable to be detected within the
testing range. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Cz–3IrB–IrG
are estimated to be the same as those of 3IrB–IrG (−4.91
and −2.24 eV, respectively). This unravels again that the involvement
of oligocarbazole dendrons via a nonconjugated linkage does not affect
the electronic nature of multinuclear Ir complex.

and 3IrB–IrG.

2.4 Electroluminescence Properties
To
explore the potential of Cz–3IrB–IrG used as the EML
alone, the nondoped device was fabricated with a configuration of
ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/SPPO13/LiF/Al (Figure 5a), where SPPO13 (2,7-bis(diphenylphosphoryl)-9,9′-spirobifluorene)
acted as the electron-transporting material.25 For comparison, a control device based on 3IrB–IrG instead
of Cz–3IrB–IrG was also prepared under the same conditions.
Thanks to efficient outside-in energy transfer, they both show only
bright green electroluminescence (EL) from the central core without
any remnant emission from the outer blue Ir complexes or oligocarbazole
dendrons (Figure 5b).
In well-agreement with the film PL counterparts, the EL spectrum of
Cz–3IrB–IrG is blue-shifted by about 4 nm relative to
that of 3IrB–IrG. The corresponding Commission Internationale
de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are (0.38, 0.58) and (0.36,
0.59) for 3IrB–IrG and Cz–3IrB–IrG, respectively.

device performance of Cz–3IrB–IrG compared
with 3IrB–IrG: (a) device configuration; (b) EL spectra at
a driving voltage of 6 V; (c) current density–voltage–luminance
characteristics; and (d) luminous efficiency and EQE as a function
of luminance.

Figure 5c,d plots
the current density–voltage–luminance characteristics
together with luminous efficiency and external quantum efficiency
(EQE) as a function of luminescence. As one can see, the current density
as well as luminescence at the same driving voltage turns out to be
decreased from 3IrB–IrG to Cz–3IrB–IrG. In addition,
the turn-on voltage at 1 cd/m2 is correspondingly up from
2.8 to 4.2 V. According to the literature,26 a cascade charge transport from dendron wedge to blue Ir complex
and then to green Ir core is within our expectation in Cz–3IrB–IrG.
Therefore, the introduction of oligocarbazole dendrons with deeper
energy levels than Ir complexes (as demonstrated in Figure 4) would inevitably sacrifice
the charge transport to some degree, resulting in the observed higher
driving voltage and lower current density. Albeit this, because of
the inhibited intermolecular interactions and TTA, the peak luminous
efficiency and EQE are obviously elevated from 32.6 cd/A and 9.7%
of 3IrB–IrG to 40.9 cd/A and 12.0% of Cz–3IrB–IrG (Table 2). In comparison with
the 3IrB–IrG, the EQE of Cz–3IrB–IrG is increased
by only 25%, which is not consistent with the PLQY improvement (80%).
We first investigated the film morphology of Cz–3IrB–IrG
by using atomic force microscopy. The film is found to be quite uniform
and homogenous with a very small root-mean-square value of 0.34 nm
(Figure S5). Therefore, the influence of
the film quality on the device performance could be reasonably excluded.
Subsequently, we note that there exists a considerable hole injection
barrier between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) and the EML caused by the dendritic wedge, which may be
tentatively responsible for the mismatch between EQE and PLQY. To
further optimize the nondoped device performance, hole injection should
be facilitated by inserting an additional hole-transporting layer
between PEDOT:PSS and the EML27 or tuning
the work function of PEDOT:PSS.28 Also,
the related work is under way.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we present the design and synthesis
of a novel dendritic
multinuclear Ir complex Cz–3IrB–IrG encapsulated by
oligocarbazole dendrons. The unwanted intermolecular interactions
and thus TTA induced by the outer blue Ir complexes could be effectively
inhibited in Cz–3IrB–IrG, owing to the characteristic
shielding effect. As a result, Cz–3IrB–IrG reveals an
improved PLQY and nondoped device efficiency relative to 3IrB–IrG
without dendrons. The result clearly indicates that further dendronization
toward multinuclear Ir complex is a promising strategy to construct
highly efficient phosphors used for nondoped PhOLEDs.29,30

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
Information
1H
and 19F NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker AVANCE nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The elemental analysis was
performed using a Bio-Rad elemental analysis system. MALDI–TOF
mass spectra were performed on an AXIMA CFR MS apparatus (COMPACT).
The UV/vis absorption in dichloromethane and PL spectra in both toluene
and film were measured by a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer
and a PerkinElmer LS 50B spectrofluorometer, respectively. In addition,
thin films on quartz for spectroscopic measurements were prepared
by drop-coating. The lifetimes of phosphorescence from the film samples
were measured in argon atmosphere by exciting the samples with 355
nm light pulses with ca. 3 ns pulse width from a Quanty-Ray DCR-2
pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Moreover, following a biexponential fitting,
the average lifetimes were calculated according to the equation: τav = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2). CV experiments were performed on
an EG&G 283 (Princeton Applied Research) potentiostat/galvanostat
system. The measurements were carried out in dichloromethane for anodic
sweeping and in dimethylformamide (DMF) for cathodic sweeping with
a conventional three-electrode system consisting of a platinum working
electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium
perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4). All
potentials were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple.
The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated according to the equation
HOMO = −e[Eox +
4.8 V] and LUMO = −e[Ered + 4.8 V], respectively, where Eox and Ered were the initial oxidation
peak value and reduction peak value, respectively.

4.2 Device Fabrication and Testing
To
fabricate nondoped PhOLEDs, a 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS film was first
deposited on the precleaned indium tin oxide (ITO)-glass substrates
(20 Ω per square) and subsequently baked at 120 °C for
40 min. Then, the EML composed of the multinuclear Ir complex alone
was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution and annealed at 100
°C for 30 min to remove the residual solvent in a N2 atmosphere. The thickness of the EML was about 40 nm. In successive
processes, a 65 nm thick film of SPPO13 was thermally evaporated on
top of the EML at a base pressure less than 4 × 10–4 Pa. Finally, a 0.5 nm thick LiF and 100 nm thick Al were evaporated
as the cathode. The active area of all of the devices was 14 mm2. The EL spectra and CIE coordinates were measured using a
PR650 spectra colorimeter. The current density–voltage and
luminance–voltage curves of the devices were measured using
a Keithley 2400 source meter and a calibrated silicon photodiode.
All of the measurements were carried out at room temperature under
ambient conditions. The EQE was calculated from the luminance, current
density, and EL spectrum, assuming a Lambertian distribution.
