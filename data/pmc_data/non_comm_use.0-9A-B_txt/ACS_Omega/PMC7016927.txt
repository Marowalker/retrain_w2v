Water softening is a relatively untapped area of research in capacitive
deionization (CDI). In this work, we demonstrate how an asymmetric
combination of oxidized and aminated carbon can be used for selective
removal of divalent cations for water softening. We first show how
higher electrosorption performances can be achieved in single-salt
experiments involving NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 before proceeding to multi-salt experiments using different combinations
of the four salts. The salt combinations are chosen to investigate
one of the three factors: (1) ionic mass, (2) ionic charge, or (3)
concentration. We show how divalent selectivity can be achieved due
to high local electrostatic attraction between negatively charged
oxygen moieties and divalent cations. Additionally, an ion-exchange
process between the oxidized carbon surface and cations can result
in lower pH values, which prevent the precipitation of scale-forming
ions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Water containing a high mineral content of calcium and magnesium
is considered “hard”. Hard water is particularly vexing
in industrial systems where scaling of pipelines or heat exchangers
can increase energy overheads, resulting in additional downtime and
higher operational costs. As such, several different methods had been
developed to decrease the mineral content or “soften”
water. These methods can be broadly classified as membrane type (reverse
osmosis1 and nanofiltration2,3), electrochemical type (electrodialysis4,5),
and chemical type (ion precipitation6 and
ion exchange7). Unfortunately, membrane
and electrochemical techniques require complicated infrastructure,
which are energy intensive and costly to maintain. Chemical methods,
on the other hand, are cheap but can create waste products, which
require further treatment before disposal. Thus, there is a real need
to develop methods, which are effective, cheap to implement, and compatible
with the environment.

In recent years, there has been much interest in developing demineralization
methods such as capacitive deionization (CDI) for water desalination8−10 and remediation.11−13 Although CDI has been around since 1960s,14 it was only recently highlighted due to the
dire state of sanitation and water scarcity.15 The concept behind CDI is to simply charge two electrodes across
a channel filled with feedwater, and ions would be adsorbed onto the
electrodes. The effluent stream would be devoid of ions, whereas the
electrodes would be fully charged. At the end of the adsorption phase,
a short-circuit is applied to discharge the electrodes and expel the
ions. Because CDI has a much lower energy efficiency than reverse
osmosis in desalination applications,16 it is more advantageous to leverage the unique features of CDI (e.g.,
ease of operation, modest infrastructure, and rapid removal of ions8,17) to specialize water purification applications. In particular, CDI
has shown great promise for the selective removal of ionic contaminants
such as phosphates,18 sulfates,19 nitrates,11,20,21 arsenic,22,23 and heavy metals.11,24−26

One of earliest works associated with the removal of multiple ionic
species was performed by Gabelich et al.27 using carbon aerogels. They investigated the electrosorption performances
of Na+, Mg2+, K+, Rb+,
Cl–, Br–, NO3–, and SO42– in a series of experiments
targeted at ionic charge, mass, and radius. Based on their findings,
they concluded that monovalent ions were preferentially adsorbed over
divalent ions due to smaller hydrated radii. A later study on anion
adsorption28 concurred with Gabelich’s
study that hydrated radius was a dominant factor between competing
anions in solution. The same study further found that stronger anions
such as NO3– could replace Cl– ions already adsorbed on the electrode surface. This phenomenon
was also reported by Seo et al.29 who showed
how monovalent Na+ can be substituted by divalent ions
of Ca2+ or Mg2+. Interestingly enough, divalent
ions can also screen electrode charge and prevent monovalent ions
from adsorbing at all.30 Although these
studies are promising, they rarely discussed the ionic strength of
the solutions with respect to their results and largely discounted
the influence of electrode properties on ion adsorption. To that end,
Han et al.31 investigated the influence
of electrode porosity on electrosorption using three different activated
carbon cloths. Seven different monovalent solutions were used for
their experiments, and their results showed that the ratio between
micro- and mesopores was effective in controlling ion selectivity.
Besides managing the porosity, doping had also been used to alter
the electrostatic attraction between the electrode and ion to improve
electrosorption performance. For example, Wei et al.26 showed that S-doped graphene aerogels adsorbed higher amounts
of heavy metal than N-doped or undoped graphene aerogels.

In a separate strategy, ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) are employed
in conjunction with electrodes to either improve electrosorption performance32 or to selectively remove ions.33−35 A fundamental study by Hassanvand et al.32 explored the differences in electrosorption between CDI and membrane
capacitive deionization (MCDI) in multi-salt solutions. Hassanvand
et al. discovered that strong electrostatic forces between divalent
ions and functional groups in IEMs could result in a desorption rate
faster than monovalent ions. They also presented effluent pH results
and showed how conventional CDI resulted in high pH values (∼10.5)
during adsorption. A high pH value can accelerate scaling effects
of divalent cations and cause ion precipitation. MCDI, on the other
hand, does not cause significant pH changes since IEMs limit the transportation
of ions taking part in faradaic reactions. Other IEMs such as monovalent
cation permselective membranes were also used in MCDI to produce divalent
cation-rich solutions.33 Although MCDI
is indeed promising for applications such as water softening, the
high costs of IEMs17 make it difficult
to realize in an industrial setting.

In this work, we adopt a strategy of grafting charged functional
groups onto activated carbon (AC) to achieve enhanced electrosorption
of divalent over monovalent cations. Earlier studies on divalent and
monovalent ion adsorption29,31 focused their discussion
on unmodified carbon electrodes and neglected the influence of chemical
groups bound to the carbon surface. Modification of existing or introduction
of new functional groups have been shown to be a cheap and effective
way to replace IEMs36−38 and tune the ion-electrode affinity. For example,
some studies have reported greater specific adsorption of divalent
cations on negatively charged surfaces.39−42 The use of functionalized carbon
for selective ion removal was notably reported by Oyarzun et al.43 who showed the selective removal of NO3– over Cl– using AC functionalized
with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Unlike their work, we
focus on the adsorption of cations and discuss the electrosorption
differences between divalent and monovalent cations using an oxidized
cathode paired with an aminated anode. We perform electrosorption
experiments in both single- and multi-salt solutions to illustrate
the effects of competition between cations and show how ion exchange
between surface groups and cations can achieve a low effluent pH.
To eliminate possible interference from dissimilar anions, only chloride
salts of NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 were chosen
for our experiments.

2 Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade
and used as-received unless otherwise stated. Activated carbon (AC,
YP-80F) was obtained from Kuraray Co. Ltd., Japan, and ultrapure water
(18.2 MΩ) was provided by an ultrapure water system (arium pro
UV, Sartorius).

2.1 Synthesis of Oxidized and Aminated AC
Prior to oxidation, the as-received AC was boiled in ultrapure water
at 100 °C for 2 h to remove any possible contaminants leftover
from the production process. The clean AC was subsequently dried at
60 °C in a vacuum oven overnight before use. Approximately 300
mg of AC was added to a round-bottom flask containing 50 mL of 7 M
HNO3 solution and stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. The mixture
was allowed to cool before it was filtered and washed several times
with ultrapure water until the pH of the filtrate reached 7. The oxidized
AC is henceforth denoted as O-AC. Similarly, clean AC for amination
was obtained after boiling with ultrapure water. About 300 mg of AC
was dispersed in an acetone solution containing 2.5 mL of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES, 99%). The mixture was stirred and heated at 70 °C until
all acetone had evaporated. The aminated AC is denoted as A-AC.

2.2 Fabrication of Electrodes
Electrodes
used in electrochemical and electrosorption experiments were fabricated
in similar fashion as previously reported.44,45 A weighed quantity of AC was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF; Mw, ∼180,000), binder, and
acetylene black in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 and ground using an agate
mortar and pestle. Approximately 3 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
(NMP, 99.5%) was added to the powdered mixture to form a slurry, which
was cast onto graphite sheets (Latech Scientific Supply Pte. Ltd.,
Singapore), and left to dry in a vacuum oven at 90 °C for 12
h. Cathodes were fabricated using either AC or O-AC, whereas anodes
were fabricated using A-AC. The amount of AC used for the cathode
depends on the capacitance ratio between AC/O-AC and A-AC. Electrodes
used for CDI experiments were 5 × 5 cm2, whereas electrodes
used in electrochemical tests were 1 × 1 cm2 with
an approximate mass of 2 mg. All electrodes were roll-pressed prior
to use to improve contact between the material and graphite substrate.
Average coating thickness after being roll-pressed was estimated to
be around 25 μm.

2.3 Characterization
Morphology and elemental
composition of the AC were characterized using a field emission scanning
electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F) equipped with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Surface functionalities were investigated
using both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. FTIR spectra were obtained
using an FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Nexus 410, Thermo Electron) over
a wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm–1 at a
resolution of 1 cm–1 operating in the transmission
mode. XPS spectra were obtained using a PHI 5400 system equipped with
an Al Kα beam source (250 W) and a position-sensitive detector
(PSD). XPS results were subsequently interpreted using CasaXPS software
(version 2.3.18) after calibrating narrow scan elements to the standard
C 1s peak (284.6 eV). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
were measured at 77 K using an Autosorb-iQ-MP-XR system (Quantachrome)
after samples were degassed at 150 °C for 6 h. Specific surface
area (SSA) and pore size distribution were determined using a quenched
solid state functional theory (QSDFT) method. Total pore volume was
calculated at relative pressure close to unity. All calculations were
performed using a proprietary software (ASWin, Quantachrome) provided
by the manufacturer.

A three-electrode configuration comprising
of a working electrode (1 × 1 cm2), a platinum counter
electrode (1.5 × 1.5 cm2), and a saturated calomel
reference (SCE) as the reference was used for electrochemical characterization.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in 0.5 M NaCl,
KCl, MgCl2, or CaCl2 solution at a scan rate
of 5 mV s–1 within a potential window of 0 to 1.0
V, while galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) experiments were performed
at a current density of 0.1 A g–1 within the same
potential window. Specific capacitances were determined from GCD curves
using 1  

All electrochemical measurements were performed using the same
electrochemical workstation (VMP3, Bio-logic).

2.4 Electrosorption Experiments
Electrosorption
experiments were performed using a CDI cell operating in the single-pass
mode, a peristaltic pump (HV-77921-65, Masterflex), a programmable
sourcemeter (SMU 2450, Keithley), and a pH meter (S220 SevenCompact,
Mettler Toledo). The CDI cell was assembled in an asymmetric configuration
where the electrodes are composed of dissimilar materials13,40,46 (cathode was composed of either
O-AC or plain AC, and anode was composed of A-AC (Figure 1b)). An acrylic separator layer
separates the two electrodes to allow feedwater to flow through, and
the whole ensemble was housed in acrylic plates secured by stainless
steel screws. A 1 V potential was applied to adsorb the salt, and
a short-circuit was used to regenerate the electrodes. Water travels
from a 5 L feedwater tank to the CDI cell then to a 10 mL holding
tank before circulating back to the feedwater tank. pH readings were
obtained near the exit port of the CDI in the holding tank at intervals
of 1 min. A schematic of this operation is provided in Figure 1a. Operational parameters such
as flow rate (25 mL min–1), adsorption or desorption
time (15 min), and solution temperature (298 K) were kept constant
in all experiments.

Dotted lines indicate the path travelled by the water, whereas solid
lines mark electrical connections. Note that aliquots were taken from
the holding tank for ICP analysis. (b) Ion adsorption using functionalized
AC materials.

We perform two sets of experiments: one using solutions containing
a single type of salt and the second using solutions containing a
mixture of salts. In single-salt experiments, we determine the cation
adsorption capacity at saturation to define the upper limit of adsorption.
Competition between ions of different charges or sizes will likely
decrease the adsorption of any ion, and a measure of this decrease
is useful in understanding how adsorption in multi-salt solution works.
Five liters of 2.5, 5, or 10 mM stock solution was prepared for single-salt
experiments, while salt mixtures used for multi-salt experiments were
varied between 5 and 10 mM as described in Table 2. The amount of cation removed was determined
by taking 1.5 mL aliquots of effluent solution from the holding tank
and diluted 10 times for inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The ICP spectrometer (ICPE-9820,
Shimadzu) was operated in the radial view mode, and a four-point calibration
curve was obtained before sample analysis. We assumed complete dissociation
of ionic salt in water and that individual ions existed in stoichiometric
amounts as specified by their chemical formula. Thus, 1 mol of monovalent
salt such as NaCl dissociates into 1 mol of Na+ and Cl–. We next assumed that cations were only adsorbed by
the cathode and anions were only adsorbed by the anode. Based on these
assumptions, we derived a metric that measured the cation adsorption
capacity of the cathode independent of the overall system. Cation
adsorption capacity, Γcation (mmol g–1), is calculated as 2  where v is
the flow rate (L min–1), c is the
cation concentration of the effluent stream (mg L–1), Mcation is the molar mass of the cation
(g mol–1), t is the time of aliquot
extraction (min), and mcathode is the
mass of the cathode (g).We also used a normalized charge efficiency
to accommodate for the difference in charge required for the adsorption
of a monovalent salt versus a divalent salt. Normalized charge efficiency,
Λn, is calculated as 3  where z is
the valence of the salt, Σ is the charge stored during the adsorption
curve (C), and F is the Faraday’s constant
of 96,485 (C mol–1). We note that charge efficiency
is only calculated for single-salt experiments.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Physical and Chemical Characterization
The morphology and elemental distribution of our AC samples are given
in Figure S1. SEM images show a collection
of fragmented carbon particles decorated with elemental oxygen. Additionally,
we observe the presence of nitrogen in A-AC arising from amine functional
groups. (Figure S1j). The porosity of AC
was investigated, and the results are shown in Figure S2. Isotherms presented in Figure S2a are predominantly type I with a small hysteresis loop.
These results are typical of AC and suggest a microporous material
with some mesoporous characteristics. Untreated AC possessed the highest
SSA at 1862 m2 g–1, while O-AC and A-AC
were 1503 and 1768 m2 g–1, respectively
(Table S2). The lower SSA of O-AC is likely
due to extensive oxidation occurring at micropore sites, which caused
micropores to coalesce into meso- or macropores.47Figure S2b–d shows similar
porosity profiles for AC, O-AC, and A-AC. Pore size distributions
(red curves) showed a primary peak at ∼1.54 nm with a minor
mesoporous peak at 3.39 nm.

In Figure 2, the FTIR spectra of AC and O-AC were remarkably
similar with an O–H stretch centered around 3430 cm–1, two types of C=C stretch at ∼1630 cm–1 (alkenyl) and ∼1560 cm–1 (aromatic), an
alkane C–H bend at ∼1380 cm–1, and
C–O–C stretch at 1114 cm–1 for AC
and 1131 cm–1 for O-AC.48 On the other hand, the FTIR spectrum of A-AC showed a comparatively
more intense peak at 3433 cm–1, which could be interpreted
as a combination of both hydroxyl O–H stretch and N–H
stretch.41,42 Peaks belonging to N–H bend (1636
cm–1), aliphatic C–N stretch (1384 cm–1), and aromatic C–N stretch (1096 cm–1) were also observed, thus confirming the presence of amine functional
groups.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of AC, O-AC, and A-AC.

XPS results are provided in Figure 3. The C 1s spectrum of untreated AC (Figure 3a) could be deconvoluted into
three peaks: two main peaks corresponding to graphitic C=C
(284.6 eV) and alkyl C–C (285.2 eV) and a minor peak belonging
to carbon singly bonded to oxygen (C–OH and/or C–O–C
at 286.3 eV). O-AC showed a similar spectra profile save for the appearance
of carbonyl carbon, C=O at 287 eV. We also observed a notable
decrease in the peak area of the alkyl C–C group (17.5 to 0.73
at %), which implied an oxidation pathway involving an attack on sp3 hybridized carbon bonds. This seems likely when we consider
the subsequent increase in oxygen moieties (Figure 3b, inset) after oxidation. The peak area
of graphitic C=C was also comparatively higher, which indicated
a defect-free structure, which was only mildly oxidized. In contrast,
A-AC did not show any oxygen functionalities but showed an amine C–N
peak at 285.8 eV. The atomic percent concentrations of peaks in the
C 1s spectrum are provided in Table S1.

for (d) AC and (e) O-AC. N 1s XPS spectra for (f) A-AC. (Inset in
(b) is a magnified image of C 1s peaks from 280 to 290 eV.)

The O 1s spectrum is compared between untreated AC and O-AC in Figure 2d,e, respectively.
Consistent with C 1s results, the O 1s spectrum of AC could be deconvoluted
into ketonic C=O (531.3 eV), ether C–O–C (532.2
eV), and hydroxyl C–OH (533.3 eV) peaks. Similarly, O 1s of
O-AC comprised of C–O–C (532.1 eV) and C–OH (533.6
eV) peaks with an additional peak at 535.4 eV attributed to chemisorbed
water or oxygen molecules as suggested by the literature.48−50 As for A-AC, its N 1s spectrum was composed of two peaks: amine
C–N (399.4 eV) and nitrogen species in C–N (400.6 eV)
configurations.

3.2 Single-Salt Solution Experiments
A preliminary benchmarking of our system in various salt solutions
was first performed before moving on to multi-salt solutions. Figure S4 shows the results of ICP analyses conducted
in single-salt solutions using either AC (top row) or O-AC (bottom
row) as the cathode. The results presented here were obtained during
the third cycle of adsorption and normalized to initial concentration
to account for differences in cation mass. Although the potential
was applied for a full 15 min, much of the ion removal occurred during
the first 2.5 min or so. Since the single-pass mode was used, effluent
solution will return to stock concentration once electrodes are saturated
with ions, and ion adsorption becomes minimal. Closer inspection of
the concentration curves revealed slight differences in the rate of
adsorption and/or desorption between monovalent and divalent cations.
Sharper adsorption and desorption curves were observed for experiments
involving monovalent cations due to faster diffusion kinetics in solution
resulting from their smaller hydrated radii (see Table 1).

Table 1 Summary of Ion Properties29,32,65
ion	valence	ionic mass
(amu)	hydrated
radius (Å)	hydration
energy (kJ mol–1)	
Na	+1	22.99	3.58	–365	
K	+1	39.098	3.31	–295	
Mg	+2	24.305	4.28	–1830	
Ca	+2	40.078	4.12	–1505	
A summary of cation adsorption capacities is provided in Figure 4a–c, and it
is apparent that adsorption capacities follow a decreasing order of
K+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ regardless of whether the cathode used was AC or O-AC. This order
also corresponds to the order at which hydrated radius and energy
decrease (see Table 1), which is consistent with what had been reported.29,32,34 In comparing the hydrated cation
size with the pore size, we note that Na+ and K+ possessed hydrated diameters approximately half the main pore size
of 1.54 nm. Thus, either two Na+ or two K+ ions
could have occupied a pore without shedding their hydrated shells.
We further note that the presence of charged groups within narrow
pores could cause reorientation of hydration shells51,52 and/or dehydration effects,53,54 which could result
in higher than expected ion adsorption. O-AC showed greater cation
adsorption as compared to plain AC, which was remarkable considering
its lower surface area. This enhanced cation adsorption could be attributed
to an increased electrostatic attraction between oxygen moieties on
O-AC and cations. Furthermore, oxygen moieties can also function as
an ion-exchange layer 40–42,61 to reject anions
and improve charge efficiency. Indeed, we observe higher salt adsorption
capacities and charge efficiencies of O-AC across all salt solutions
(Figure 4d–f).
Charge efficiencies do not seem to follow any order corresponding
to ion properties but generally increase at higher salt concentrations.

Figure 4 Cation adsorption capacities in (a) 2.5 mM, (b) 5 mM, and (c) 10
mM single-salt solution experiments. Salt adsorption capacities (solid
blue and red columns) and normalized charge efficiencies (shaded blue
and red columns) of (d) 2.5 mM, (e) 5 mM, and (f) 10 mM single-salt
solution experiments.

The initial pH value of the salt solutions was recorded prior to
CDI experiments as a reference. pH values of NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 solutions were slightly lower than the expected neutral value
of 7, which was probably due to the presence of dissolved CO2. The pH value of MgCl2 solution was approximately 6 when
MgCl2 first dissolved but steadily increased to 8–9.
MgCl2 solution was originally a neutral to mildly acidic
salt under room temperature conditions, and the increase in pH was
likely due to the formation of small amounts of MgCO3.
When a potential of 1.0 V was applied, the AC (Figure 5a–c) cathode system showed an increase
in pH, whereas O-AC (Figure 5d–f) showed a decrease in pH. We note that the increase
in pH for the AC cathode system was not immediate for some solutions,
and a small dip in pH was sometimes observed. This dip could be the
result of transient faradaic reactions due to a large potential swing
from 0 to 1.0 V. After that, pH values rapidly increased and seem
to stabilize at values between 8 and 9. Previous reports30,55,56 attribute this pH change to oxygen
reduction reactions (ORRs) occurring at the carbon cathode. ORRs can
proceed via a two-electron or four-electron pathway,30,57 and both pathways will inevitably produce hydroxyl ions, causing
the pH to increase. However, this pH was not completely constant and
tapered off after the 7.5 min mark. Since the applied potential was
low (<1.23 V), we can rule out Cl– oxidation57 and/or water splitting34 as reasons for the decrease. This decrease in pH was likely due
to unsustained rates of the reaction from ORRs. As rates of the reaction
decreased, the effluent pH gradually returned to its initial value.
Furthermore, we did not observe any salt precipitation during our
experiments despite the high pH. Upon removal of the potential, effluent
pH returned to their original pH values.

Figure 5 Effluent pH of (a) 2.5 mM, (b) 5 mM, and (c) 10 mM single-salt
solution experiments using AC as the cathode. Effluent pH of (d) 2.5
mM, (e) 5 mM, and (f) 10 mM single-salt solution experiments using
O-AC as the cathode (dotted line at a 15 min mark indicates a switch
from adsorption to desorption).

In contrast, O-AC showed an almost inverted pH profile. pH values
first decreased to values as low as 4.25 before steadily climbing
up. The decrease in pH could be attributed to an ion exchange between
protons attached to negatively charged oxygen moieties and cations.
As such, protons are substituted for cations and are displaced into
the water, causing the decrease in pH. As cation adsorption starts
to saturate, the rate of displacement of protons will also decrease,
which will result in the pH returning to its initial level. Once the
potential is removed, the effluent pH rapidly returns to its initial
pH. Thus, a negatively charged cathode can effectively adsorb cations
and reduce the effluent pH at the same time, which makes it an attractive
candidate for water softening.

3.3 Multi-Salt Solution Experiments
All
experiments in this section involved the use of a solution mixed with
two kinds of salts. Experiments were designed to investigate one of
the three factors: (1) ionic mass, (2) ionic charge, or (3) concentration.
A description of the experiments is provided in Table 2.

3.3.1 Effects of Ionic Mass
The influence
of cation mass was investigated in experiments 1 and 2 (see Table 2) where cations were
either all monovalent or all divalent. Cation adsorption curves presented
in Figure S5 show similar behavior to that
of single-salt solution experiments. Adsorption and desorption curves
using the O-AC cathode were distinctly sharper than that of AC and
can be attributed to the stronger electrostatic forces provided by
the O-AC surface. One might expect to see slight differences in rates
of adsorption due to ion competition, but the curves showed an almost
simultaneous drop in concentration at around 2 min. Thus, it appeared
that there was no kinetic or diffusion constraints related to ionic
mass.

Adsorption capacities are calculated and summarized in Figure 6a,b. In experiment
1 (Figure 6a), we observed
higher adsorption capacities for K+ than Na+ regardless of whether the cathode used was AC or O-AC. If we were
to assume cation adsorption on both sides of a pore, two Na+ ions possessed a combined diameter of 1.43 nm, which is slightly
smaller than the main pore size of 1.54 nm. In contrast, the combined
diameter of two K+ ions was only 1.32 nm. Given that the
hydration energy of K+ was smaller than Na+,
it was energetically more favorable for two K+ ions to
fit in a pore rather than two Na+ ions. Single-salt experiments
did not face this problem since there was no competition between cations.
It should be noted that the component ion adsorption capacities in
experiment 1 were far lower than those in single-salt experiments.
For example, the total adsorption capacity of Na+ and K+ components in multi-salt solution using an AC cathode was
0.122 mmol g–1 as compared to the adsorption capacity
of either Na+ (0.154 mmol g–1) or K+ (0.182 mmol g–1) in single-salt experiments.
Competition between dissimilar ions for limited adsorption sites had
resulted in a lower overall adsorption capacity.

Figure 6 Cation adsorption capacities in multi-salt solutions containing
(a) 5 mM NaCl and 5 mM KCl and (b) 5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM
CaCl2 solutions. Effluent pH of (c) 5 mM NaCl and 5 mM
KCl and (d) 5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM CaCl2 solutions.

As for divalent cation adsorption, we observed a higher adsorption
capacity for Mg2+ than Ca2+ for both AC and
O-AC cathodes. Mg2+ adsorption with an AC cathode amounted
to 52% of total cation adsorption, whereas it was 62% with an O-AC
cathode. According to hydrolysis constant values provided by He et
al.,58 the pKa of Mg2+ (11.4) is lower than Ca2+ (12.8),
which indicated a higher tendency to hydrolyze. Hydrolysis effects
could be significant in experiments using the unmodified AC cathode
since adsorption occurred under alkaline conditions. However, our
results did not reflect the effects of cation hydrolysis as Mg2+ adsorption was comparable to Ca2+ after accounting
for experimental deviation. In the case of divalent cation adsorption,
electrostatic attractive forces were higher across mesopores, which
resulted in faster diffusion kinetics for the cation with a smaller
mass. Therefore, Mg2+ experienced a higher rate of mass
transfer than Ca2+. Once adsorbed onto the carbon surface,
Mg2+ ions were not easily displaced by Ca2+ ions
due to similarly high electrostatic forces acting on them. In this
case, O-AC showed greater selectivity toward Mg2+ than
Ca2+.

Effluent pH curves in Figure 6c,d resemble those in Figure 5b,e, respectively. During adsorption, pH
increased for the AC cathode and decreased for the O-AC cathode. The
pH curve of O-AC cathode did not decrease as much as one might expect,
given the results in single-salt experiments. Nevertheless, it is
still an improvement over its AC counterpart.

3.3.2 Effects of Ionic Charge
The effects
of charge were investigated in salt solutions containing equimolar
concentrations of Na+ and Mg2+ or K+ and Ca2+ (experiments 3 and 4, respectively). Monovalent
and divalent cations were paired this way to minimize the effects
of cation mass. Under typical conditions, electrosorption using an
AC cathode resulted in a concentration curve with sharper adsorption
and desorption peaks for monovalent cations due to better diffusion
kinetics. Divalent cations tend to adsorb much slower due to their
larger sizes. Although this was observed for the O-AC cathode system
(Figure S6b,d), the concentration curves
of monovalent cations appeared unstable and less symmetrical. The
adsorption of divalent cations was also visibly slower and took a
longer time to reach saturation. The discrepancy in saturation times
between divalent cation adsorption for the O-AC cathode system and
the AC cathode system was unmistakable. We hypothesize that the substantially
lower hydration energies of monovalent cations endowed them with greater
affinity for the charged carbon surface, and these ions59 had first adsorbed onto the pore surfaces of
O-AC around the 2 min mark, which deprived divalent cations of adsorption
sites. However, strong electrostatic forces between divalent cations
and the O-AC surface eventually led to divalent ions displacing their
monovalent competitors around the 2.5 min mark. Mg2+ and
Ca2+ adsorption accounted for 52 and 49% of total cation
adsorption in an AC cathode system, whereas it was 68 and 69% for
the O-AC cathode system (Figure 7a,b), respectively. Since the hydration energy of Ca2+ is lower than that of Mg2+, the marginally higher
adsorption of Ca2+ over Mg2+ could be due to
partial reorientation or dehydration of the hydration shell near the
charged carbon pores.59 Thus, simple oxidation
of the carbon surface can increase selectivity of divalent over monovalent
cations. Effluent pH curves shown in Figure 7c,d were expectedly a mix between the pH
of monovalent and divalent salt solutions. Changes in effluent pH
during CDI mostly followed previous experiments.

Figure 7 Cation adsorption capacities in multi-salt solutions containing
(a) 5 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 and (b) 5 mM KCl and 5 mM
CaCl2 solutions. Effluent pH of (c) 5 mM NaCl and 5 mM
MgCl2 and (d) 5 mM KCl and 5 mM CaCl2 solutions.

3.3.3 Effects of Concentration
We investigated
the effects of concentration in solutions containing 10 mM monovalent
salt and 5 mM divalent salt (experiments 5 and 6, respectively). Cation
combinations were chosen to be the same as experiments 3 and 4. Salt
concentration is a variable that is rarely considered in reports on
selective removal of ions yet plays an influential role in the competitive
removal of dissimilar ion species. The concentration of monovalent
cations was chosen to be twice that of divalent cations to simulate
an environment of equal ionic strength. Figure S7 shows the results of our electrosorption experiments. Two
observations could be made based on the results of the AC cathode
system in Figure S7a,c. First, there was
an overall increase in adsorption of both monovalent and divalent
cations as compared to experiments 3 and 4. Second, adsorption peaks
for Mg2+ and Ca2+ had shifted slightly to the
right, which implied the displacement of some monovalent cations.
The O-AC cathode system, on the other hand, retained similar adsorption/desorption
patterns as before.

Cation adsorption capacities are calculated
and described in Figure 8a,b. As compared to experiments 3 and 4, the AC cathode showed a higher
proportion of Na+ and K+ adsorption capacities
with Na+ and K+ accounting for 65.0 and 67.4%
of total cation adsorption capacity, respectively. These results can
be attributed to the higher concentration and ionic strength of monovalent
cations. Divalent cation selectivity was evaluated using the O-AC
cathode in experiments 5 and 6, and O-AC showed a loss of selectivity
for Mg2+ over Na+ but not for Ca2+ over K+. It should be noted that a loss of selectivity
does not imply a decrease of Mg2+ adsorption capacity as
observed in Figure 6b, Figure 7a, and Figure 8a where the adsorption
capacity had remained fairly constant at around 0.10 mmol g–1. The only time a decrease was recorded was when Mg2+ was
competing with Ca2+ ions (Figure 6b). Thus, this simply meant that a greater
amount of Na+ was adsorbed.

Figure 8 Cation adsorption capacities in multi-salt solutions containing
(a) 10 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 and (b) 10 mM KCl and 5 mM
CaCl2 solutions. Effluent pH of (c) 10 mM NaCl and 5 mM
MgCl2 and (d) 10 mM KCl and 5 mM CaCl2 solutions.

Effluent pH of both AC and O-AC cathodes in experiment 5 (Figure 8c) averaged around
8.5 during adsorption and gradually decreased during desorption. It
appeared that an increase in Na+ concentration or rather
an increase in ionic strength of solution had minimized the effects
of ion-exchange reactions and stabilized the pH at basic levels. Once
the potential was removed, pH slowly returned to a pH dominated by
the presence of NaCl. Experiment 6 (Figure 8d) shows a familiar trend of pH increase
for the AC cathode and a pH decrease for the O-AC cathode. Effluent
pH of O-AC decreased first but recovered rather quickly due to the
high concentration of KCl.

4 Conclusions
We have investigated the adsorption of monovalent and divalent
cations using functionalized carbon electrodes in a series of single-
and multi-salt experiments using NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and
CaCl2. We first started our experiments in single-salt
solutions to determine a baseline performance for our functionalized
materials then proceeded to investigate the cation adsorption of O-AC
over the AC cathode. We recorded an increase in adsorption capacities
corresponding to the order at which hydrated cation radius decreases.
This was reasonable given that smaller ions fit more easily in pores.
Ion exchange occurring on the functionalized surface of O-AC provided
an additional advantage of decreasing pH, which was desirable for
water softening.

Competition between cations was investigated in multi-salt solution
experiments based on (1) ionic mass, (2) ionic charge, or (3) concentration.
First, we showed how kinetic advantages of a smaller ionic mass contributed
to an increase in Mg2+ adsorption over Ca2+ for
the O-AC cathode. Next, we demonstrated how divalent cation selectivity
could be achieved using an oxidized AC. The divalent cation selectivity
was attributed to a greater electrostatic attraction between negatively
charged oxygen moieties and divalent cations. Lastly, we report a
loss of selectivity for Mg2+ over Na+ when the
ionic strength of Na+ was matched to Mg2+. Future
work will have to investigate the limits of ion selectivity against
a background of ions with matching or even higher ionic strength.
