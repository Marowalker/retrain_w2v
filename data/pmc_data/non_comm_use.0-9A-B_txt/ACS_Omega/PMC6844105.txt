In
this work, SiO2 microspheres were first prepared
by a conventional Stöber method and then etched by NaOH solution
to obtain porous ones. By tuning the degree of etching, specific surface
area of SiO2 microspheres could be controlled. Then, small
fluorescent molecules are synthesized and incorporated onto the surface
and/or pores of the SiO2 via layer-by-layer reaction to
obtain fluorescent microspheres, namely, SiO2–NH2–BODIPY (SiNBB), SiO2–NH2–BODIPY–indole–benzothiazole (SiNBIT), and SiO2–NH2–BODIPY–indole–benzoxazole
(SiNBIO). The as-prepared microspheres SiNBB exhibit highly sensitive
and selective recognition ability for Hg2+ and Pb2+. When SiNBB encounters Hg2+ and Pb2+, the
fluorescence intensity of SiNBB is increased up to fivefold. SiNBIT
and SiNBIO are solely sensitive to Hg2+, and both have
a single high sensitivity to recognize Hg2+. The adsorption
efficiency of Hg2+ by the three fluorescent microspheres
SiNBB, SiNBIT, and SiNBIO reached 2.91, 0.99, and 0.98 g/g of microspheres,
respectively. Experimental results of A549 cells and zebrafish indicate
that the fluorescent microspheres are permeable to cell membranes
and organisms. The distribution of Hg2+ in the brain of
zebrafish was obtained by the fluorescence confocal imaging technique,
and Hg2+ was successfully detected in A549 cells and zebrafish.

==== Body
Introduction
SiO2 microspheres are small spheres with the size of
nano- and/or submicron scale. They often have regular shapes, uniform
particle size, good dispersion, large pore volume, continuously adjustable
pore size, regular pore structure, and good thermal stability.1 Therefore, they have attracted wide attention
in the field of adsorption and separation2 because of the large specific surface area. However, they are also
prone to agglomeration, so that their adsorption properties are hindered.
To overcome this shortcoming, their surfaces are frequently chemically
modified.3,4 Usually, functional groups are introduced
to the surfaces of microspheres; the dispersion and absorption ability
are improved eventually.

Because the surface of SiO2 microspheres have a large
amount of −OH groups, it is very suitable for functionalization
by modification.5,6 The surface of silica nanoparticles
is mostly modified with an organic ligand (such as amino group or
sulfhydryl group) for the adsorption of metal substances.7 Further, SiO2 microspheres also have
excellent biocompatibility and are selected as carriers for detecting
and identifying fluorescent sensors. The composite SiO2 microsphere can detect and recognize metal substances in cells or
organisms. Thus, silica particles can be used as carriers for new
materials and combined nanomaterials because of their easily modified
surface and show broad application prospects in chemical catalysis
and cell labeling.8

With the everlasting
development of our society, wastewaters are
largely discharged into nature. Many harmful substances in wastewater
are difficult to be naturally decomposed, and they accumulated, which
cause great harm to the entire ecosystem. Heavy metal (HM) ion is
one of most toxic issue. HM ions, such as Zn2+ and Fe3+, are essential elements for human body to ensure normal
physiological activities within a reasonable range. However, when
the concentration of trace elements in water exceeds a reasonable
amount, they are harmful.9,10 Furthermore, some HMs
are very difficult to be biodegraded. On the other hand, they continuously
enriched under the action of the food chain, and finally enter the
human body.11,12 Among HM ions, Hg2+ mainly harms the human central nervous system and damages the brain.
Once Pb2+ enters the human body, it is extremely harmful
to the nerves, hematopoietic system, and kidneys. Therefore, it is
necessary to identify and remove harmful HMs. The essential metal
ions should be monitored as well.

Instrumental methodology is
the best way for the detection of HMs.
Typical instrumental methods are atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS),13 atomic fluorescence spectroscopy,14 ion coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MS),15 and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy.16 However, these instruments are expensive and
difficult to achieve real-time detection. Therefore, it is important
to develop recognizing reagents for HM analysis.

Introducing
fluorescent moieties to the surfaces of microspheres
is a good method for their modification and fictionalization. Fluorescent
microspheres emit fluorescence when stimulated by external energy17 as the parts before incorporation methods for
preparing fluorescent microspheres include physical adsorption,18 embedding,19 self-assembly,20,21 copolymerization,22 and chemical bonding.23 The as-prepared fluorescent microspheres exhibit
both recognition and removal ability to metal ions. At the same time,
fluorescent microspheres can be used to label, screen substances,
or organisms and as a standard to calibrate optical instruments.24,25

Salinas-Castillo et al.26 have
reported
a novel imidazole-functionalized microsphere as a fluorescent material
and used to develop Cu(II) in water samples. This micromaterial can
rapidly determine CN- and Cu(II) in natural water samples. This demonstrates
that fluorescent microsphere materials can be used in natural water
to detect target ions. Ding et al.27 synthesized
a bifunctional fluorescent microsphere sensor using a 2,2-dipyridylamine
derivative as a binding receptor immobilized on silica microspheres,
which can be used to detect Cd2+, Hg2+, and
Pb2+. Moreover, the fluorescent microspheres can also be
used as an adsorbent for separating toxic metal ions. The reported
data show that the fluorescent microspheres have good application
value in detecting and removing HM ions in water.

In this work,
mesoporous SiO2 microspheres were prepared
by the Stöber method. Then, small fluorescent sensors are incorporated
to the surfaces and/or pores to prepare fluorescent microspheres.
The as-prepared fluorescent microsphere SiO2–NH2–BODIPY (SiNBB) exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity
to Hg2+ and Pb2+. It can remove Hg2+ ions in water with as high efficiency as 2.91 g/g microspheres.
The adsorption of Hg2+ by SiNBB is superior to some of
the similar fluorescent microspheres that have been reported.28,29 The other fluorescent microspheres SiO2–NH2–BODIPY–indole–benzothiazole (SiNBIT)
and SiO2–NH2–BODIPY–indole–benzoxazole
(SiNBIO) were synthesized by a layer-by-layer (LBL) reaction method.
They also have better selectivity for Hg2+. Through bioimaging
tests, these three fluorescent microspheres can be used to monitor
Hg2+ in living cells. At the same time, the experimental
results of zebrafish also showed that the microsphere SiNBB can perform
Hg2+ imaging with high sensitivity in the organism.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation and Morphology Analysis of Porous
Microspheres
To prepare pristine silica particles, ethanol
(150 mL) and aqueous
ammonia solution (50 mL) were mixed and added to a 1000 mL four-necked
flask. The tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) solution (125 mL, diluted
in 150 mL of absolute ethanol) was added dropwise to the flask within
1 h and stirred at 25 °C for 24 h; original SiO2 microspheres
were obtained accordingly.30 The silica
microspheres were washed with deionized water and centrifuged for
further use.

SiO2 microspheres are etched with different
concentrations of NaOH at equal time (10 min). The morphologies of
the microspheres before and after etching are shown in Figure 1. The surface of the microspheres
before etching is smooth (Figure 1a). Figure 1b,c,e shows the morphology of the same original SiO2 etched with 1 M NaOH, 2 M NaOH, and 4 M NaOH solution. It can be
seen that the surface of the microspheres gradually became coarse.
It can be clearly seen from Figure 1f that the surface of the SiO2 etched by
4 M NaOH solution is severely uneven. At the same time, the specific
surface area is larger than that of the microspheres etched by other
NaOH concentrations.

Figure 1 (a) SEM images of original SiO2 microspheres,
about
1 μm in size. (b,c) SEM image of original SiO2 microspheres
etched by 1 M NaOH, 2 M NaOH, about 0.6 μm in size. (d–f)
SEM image of original SiO2 microspheres etched by 4 M NaOH,
about 0.65 μm in size.

N2 adsorption/desorption test was performed on the SiO2 microspheres, and the results further showed the relationship
between the etching degree and specific surface areas. The greater
the etching degree, the larger the specific surface area obtained.
However, there is no obvious linear change in the pore width; the
average pore width is about 15 nm. When the concentration of NaOH
excesses 5 M, the SiO2 microspheres are almost dissolved.
Therefore, in order to obtain the microsphere with the largest specific
surface area, the concentration of 4 M NaOH is best. The SiO2 (1 g) etched by 4 M NaOH was dispersed in toluene, −NH2 modified SiO2 was obtained by adding 0.2 g 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) and refluxing for 8 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution
tests were also carried out on −NH2–SiO2. The results showed that the specific surface area and pore
width were not notably affected by the NH2CH2CH2-group (Table 1).

Preparation of Fluorescent
Microspheres
In order to
connect NH2–SiO2 microspheres with fluorescent
small molecules, B1 and BB were synthesized. Figures S1–S3 shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 1H NMR, and MS structure characterization of the synthesized
B1 and BB. Through LBL reaction method, SiNBB, SiO2–NH2–BODIPY–indole (SiNBI), SiNBIT, and SiNBIO were
successfully prepared separately. The infrared spectrum of the four
fluorescent microspheres can be seen from Figure 2a. The stretching vibration peak of Schiff
base C=N– was observed at 1632 cm–1 in SiNBB, indicating that the Schiff base reaction of SiO2–NH2 and BB was successful. The −C=O
characteristic peak of 1727 cm–1 in the SiNBI infrared
spectra can be seen. It was confirmed that 5-bromoindole-3-carboxaldehyde
(BC) was successfully assembled onto the microspheres. The −C=O
characteristic peak of SiNBIT and SiNBIO disappeared, and a new band
corresponding to the −C–S–C bond appeared at
924 cm–1. This demonstrates that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole
(MBT) and 2-mercaptobenzoxazole (MBX) are assembled onto the microspheres.
The characteristic peaks of the four fluorescent microspheres appear
as expected.

Figure 2 (a) FTIR spectra of SiNBB, SiNBI, SiNBIT, and SiNBIO.
(b) TGA weight
loss curve for six different microspheres, residual quality, and graft
ratio table.

The amount of organic compound
grafted onto the microspheres can
be inferred by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Figure 2b shows the TGA curves for
six different microspheres. The residue after a high temperature of
650 °C is SiO2, and the amount of BB, BC, MBT, and
MBX grafted onto the microspheres can be calculated accordingly. From
the table of grafting ratio in Figure 2b, it can be found that the grafting ratio of fluorescent
molecules on the microspheres is gradually increased.

In order
to further confirm the successful introduction of fluorescent
small molecules, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed, as shown in Table S1. Original
SiO2 contains three elements: C (284 eV), Si (102 eV),
and O (532 eV). The presence of the N (398 eV) in SiO2–NH2 indicates the successful introduction of the NH2CH2CH2-group. The XPS of SiNBB exhibited new
elemental peaks F (685 eV) and B (191 eV), indicating that BB was
successfully grafted onto SiO2–NH2. Table 2 shows the proportion
of each element in different microspheres. The S element peak appeared,
confirming that MBT and MBX were successfully assembled. This demonstrates
that it is feasible to introduce fluorescent small molecules into
the microspheres by the LBL reaction method.

A reference compound BBB was synthesized to demonstrate
the correctness
of the fluorescent small molecule structure on the microspheres. The
synthetic route is shown in Scheme 1. Figure S1b shows the FTIR
structural characterization of the BBB and confirms the product. BBB
is insoluble in dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl
sulfoxide, methanol, and a series of common solvents of Suzuki coupling
reaction, resulting in the failure to continue to connect BC and the
termination of the reaction. This also proves the superiority of the
LBL reaction method in microsphere grafting. The advantage of the
LBL reaction method is not only that the desired fluorescent microspheres
can be prepared but also the process of preparing the microspheres
becomes simpler. At the same time, compared with the reference compound
BBB, the fluorescent microspheres can avoid a large loss of the fluorescent
intermediate. After the reaction is completed, only the microspheres
need to be washed to avoid using time-consuming column chromatography.
More importantly, fluorescent microspheres can be prepared in large
quantities.

Performance of the Fluorescent
Microsphere SiNBB to Metal Ions
Detection and Recognition
of Metal Ions by Fluorescent Microspheres
SiNBB
The sensing properties of SiNBB fluorescent microspheres
were measured on a large number of metal ions. First, metal ion solution
Cu2+, Ag+, Zn2+, Cd2+,
Hg2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Sn4+, and Sn2+ are added
to the mixed solution of SiNBB (in glycerol/ethanol = 2:1, v/v). UV–vis
and fluorescence spectra were recorded. As shown in Figures 3a and S5a, both fluorescence and UV–visible absorption spectra
indicate that SiNBB is sensitive to Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions. Figure S6 also shows that other
ions do not cause visible color changes in SiNBB.

Figure 3 (a) Fluorescence spectra
of the fluorescent microspheres SiNBB
(2 mg/mL) dissolved in a mixed solvent (glycerol/ethanol = 2:1, v/v)
when excited by λex = 360 nm. Metal ions Cu2+, Ag+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Sn4+, Sn2+ (10 equiv). (b) Addition of single-metal
ions to SiNBB. (c) SiNBB is added with Hg2+, others metal
ions and albumin. (d) SiNBB is added with Pb2+, others
metal ions and albumin. The fluorescence intensity of SiNBB varies
with the change of Hg2+ (e) and Pb2+. (f) Concentrations
from 0 to 20 equiv.

Figure 3a shows
the fluorescence SiNBB upon the addition of metal ions (λex = 360 nm). It can be seen that the presence of other metal
ions other than Hg2+ and Pb2+ does not cause
a change in the emission spectra of SiNBB. After the addition of Hg2+ and Pb2+, the fluorescence intensity of SiNBB
increased by about fivefold. Adding Hg2+ shifted the emission
wavelength of SiNBB from 530 to 517 nm. Similarly, the addition of
Pb2+ shifted the emission wavelength of SiNBB from 530
to 512 nm. The data show that SiNBB have selective recognition effect
on Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions. This may be due to the
fact that C=N bond and C=N isomerization is a very strong
excited state decay process, which results in the weak fluorescence
of SiNBB.31,32 When Hg2+ or Pb2+ is
coordinated with C=N to inhibit isomerization, the rigidity
of SiNBB is enhanced and the fluorescence intensity is significantly
enhanced.

Figure S6b showed the images
taken under
UV light (365 nm). It could be seen that by SiNBB color change, Hg2+ and Pb2+ could be detected. In addition, as shown
in Figure S6a, even under natural light,
the color change of SiNBB is obvious upon the addition of Hg2+ and Pb2+. Therefore, SiNBB can be used as a “naked
eye” detection reagent for Hg2+ and Pb2+.

Interference of Other Ions and Albumin on Fluorescent Microspheres
SiNBB
Figure 3b shows the effect of SiNBB in identifying each ion in the form of
histogram. It can be seen that only Hg2+ and Pb2+ can significantly enhance the fluorescence intensity of SiNBB. As
shown in Figure 3c,d,
the interference of other ions and albumin on the recognition of Hg2+ and Pb2+ by SiNBB microspheres was studied. By
comparison of Figure 3b–d, it can be seen that when other metal ions and albumin
are added, fluorescence intensity of SiNBB increases as the same as
contacting with Hg2+ and Pb2+ only. This indicates
that SiNBB is not significantly interfered by other metal ions. That
is to say, Hg2+ and Pb2+ could be detected in
the presence of other interfering metal ions and albumin.

Sensitivity
of Fluorescent Microspheres SiNBB to Hg2+ and Pb2+
To determine the detection limits of
Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions, the fluorescence spectra
of SiNBB in the presence of different equivalents of Hg2+ and Pb2+ were tested. As shown in Figure 3e, as the Hg2+ concentration was
increased from 0 to 8 equiv, the fluorescence intensity of SiNBB increased
accordingly, and the final emission spectra curves have a blue shift
of about 15 nm. Figure 3f shows that when the Pb2+ concentration increases from
0 to 11 equiv, the fluorescence intensity of SiNBB increases. When
the Pb2+ concentration is 9 equiv, the emission spectra
instantaneously blue shifts by about 18 nm. The concentration-dependent
fluorescence signal transduction of SiNBB to Hg2+ and Pb2+ is obtained from Figure 3 and plotted in Figure 4a,b.

Figure 4 Concentration-dependent fluorescence signals of fluorescent
microspheres
for Hg2+ and Pb2+. (a) SiNBB, (c) SiNBIT, and
(d) SiNBIO toward Hg2+ using the fluorescence spectroscopy
technique (b) SiNBB, toward Pb2+ using the fluorescence
spectroscopy technique.

The limit of detection
(LOD) of sensors is obtained by using the
following equation 1  where
α is the standard deviation of
the blank sensor solution; K is the slope of the
calibration curve.

Figure 4a shows K = 18.58 for the LOD of SiNBB
for Hg2+ and K = 11.126 for LOD of SiNBB
for Pb2+. Through
calculation, the LOD of SiNBB for Hg2+ is 1.09 μM
and for Pb2+ is 1.82 μM. Furthermore, it can be seen
from Figure 4a,b that
the linear concentration range of Hg2+ begins from 1.09
to 40 μM, and the fluorescence intensity of SiNBB changes linearly
when Hg2+ is added. Similarly, the linear concentration
range of Pb2+ is from 1.82 to 50 μM, and the fluorescence
intensity also changes linearly when SiNBB contacts with Pb2+.

Adsorption Properties of Fluorescent Microspheres SiNBB for
Hg2+
AAS is a common elemental (HM) analysis method.
In order to determine the difference of Hg2+ adsorption
performance SiO2 microspheres, the adsorption performance
of different microspheres for Hg2+ was tested by AAS. From Table 3, it can be seen that
an ion solution containing 150 mg of Hg2+ and the original
SiO2 (50 mg) were subjected to an adsorption test for 1
h to remove 28.2 mg of Hg2+. Under the same conditions,
the microsphere SiNBB can absorb 145.7 mg of Hg2+, which
is close to complete adsorption. The efficiency of SiNBB to adsorb
Hg2+ for is fivefold as original SiO2. When
the adsorption time is 1 h, 0.56 g of mercury ions can be removed
per gram of the original SiO2 microspheres, and 2.91 g
of mercury ions can be removed per gram of SiNBB microspheres. The
adsorption efficiency of microspheres SiNBB is much better than that
of Original SiO2.

Performance of the Fluorescent
Microsphere SiNBIT to Metal Ions
Detection and Recognition
of Metal Ions by Fluorescent Microspheres
SiNBIT
A series of metal ion solutions were added to SiNBIT
solution, and the fluorescence spectra of the mixture were recorded.
As shown in Figure 5a, SiNBIT is only sensitive to Hg2+ ions. That is to say,
except for Hg2+ ions, the presence of other metal ions
does not induce changes in the SiNBIT fluorescence emission spectra.
After adding Hg2+, the fluorescence of SiNBIT quenched
notably, the fluorescence intensity decreased by threefold, and the
fluorescence peak did not shift significantly.

Figure 5 (a) Fluorescence spectra
of the fluorescent microspheres SiNBIT
(2 mg/mL) dissolved in a mixed solvent (glycerol/ethanol = 2:1, v/v)
when excited by λex = 320 nm. Metal ions Cu2+, Ag+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Sn4+, Sn2+ (10 equiv). (b) Addition of single-metal
ions to SiNBIT. (c) Other ions and albumin interfere with SiNBIT.
(d) Fluorescence intensity of SiNBIT varies with the change of Hg2+ concentrations from 0 to 20 equiv.

SiNBIT also has a C=N bond, but when SiNBIT coordinated
with Hg2+, it shows a phenomenon completely different from
SiNBB in terms of fluorescence intensity. This may be due to the fact
that mercury is a chalcophile element with strong binding force to
C–S bonds; compared with C=N bonds, Hg2+ is
easier to coordinate with C–S bonds in this situation.33,34

The SiNBB image before and after the addition of Hg2+ also confirmed that Hg2+ could weaken the luminescence
intensity of the SiNBIT solution. Similarly, the recognition of Hg2+ by SiNBIT and SiNBB can both achieve an instantaneous effect.

Interference of Other Ions and Albumin on Fluorescent Microspheres
SiNBIT
Figure 5b shows the effect of SiNBIT in detecting metal ions in the histogram.
It can be seen that only Hg2+ can significantly quench
the fluorescence intensity of SiNBIT. When other interfering metal
ions and albumin are added, the ability of SiNBIT to recognize Hg2+ is not affected, and the fluorescence intensity quenching
remains unchanged.

Sensitivity of Fluorescent Microspheres SiNBIT
to Hg2+
The fluorescence spectra of microsphere
SiNBIT in the presence
of Hg2+ with different equivalents were tested. As shown
in Figure 5d, when
the concentration of Hg2+ increases, the fluorescence intensity
of SiNBIT decreases. Finally, when the Hg2+ concentration
is higher than 12 equiv, the fluorescence intensity of SiNBIT does
not change. Concentration-dependent fluorescence signaling of SiNBIT
to Hg2+ was obtained from Figure 5 and plotted in Figure 4c. Figure 4c shows K = 6.6615 for calculating
the detection limit of SiNBIT for Hg2+.

By using
the LOD equation, the LOD of SiNBIT for Hg2+ is 2.23 μM.
Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 4c that when the concentration of Hg2+ is in the range of 2.23–12 μM, the fluorescence intensity
changes linearly when SiNBIT contacts Hg2+.

Adsorption
Properties of Fluorescent Microspheres SiNBIT for
Hg2+
Table 3 shows the adsorption performance of SiNBIT for Hg2+ at different adsorption times. A solution containing 150 mg of Hg2+ was subjected to SiNBIT (50 mg) for 1 h, and 49.9 mg of
Hg2+ was absorbed. The adsorption efficiency of Hg2+ on SiNBIT microspheres for 1 h is 2-fold of the original
SiO2, and 0.99 g of mercury ions can be removed by 1 g
of SiNBIT. SiNBIT is slightly weaker than SiNBB. However, the adsorption
performance of SiNBIT is still better than that of the original SiO2.

Performance of the Fluorescent Microsphere
SiNBIO to Metal Ions
Detection of Metal Ions by Fluorescent Microspheres
SiNBIO
Fluorescence spectra of SiNBIO upon addition of metal
ions were
recorded. Figure 6a
shows that SiNBIO, like SiNBIT, is only sensitive to Hg2+ ions. Other metal ions do not cause significant changes in the emission
spectra. After the addition of Hg2+, the fluorescence of
SiNBIO quenched threefold, and the fluorescence peak did not shift
significantly. At the same time, SiNBIO and SiNBIT have a sole recognition
ability of Hg2+, while SiNBIO, SiNBIT, and SiNBB can achieve
the transient effect on Hg2+ recognition. SiNBIO and SiNBIT
exhibit similar performance in fluorescence, which might be attributed
to the same coordination mechanism of SiNBIT with Hg2+.

when excited by λex = 310 nm. Metal ions Cu2+, Ag+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Ba2+, Sn4+, and Sn2+ (10 equiv). (b) Addition of
single-metal ions to SiNBIO. (c) Other ions and albumin interfere
with SiNBIO. (d) Fluorescence intensity of SiNBIO varies with the
change of Hg2+ concentrations from 0 to 20 equiv.

Interference of Other Ions and Albumin on
Fluorescent Microspheres
SiNBIO
Interference of other ions and albumin on the recognition
of Hg2+ by SiNBIO was also investigated. As shown in Figure 6b, only SiNBIO has
notable fluorescence quenching when contacting with Hg2+. By comparison of Figure 6c with Figure 6b, it can be seen that when other metal ions and albumin were added,
the degree of fluorescence quenching is the same as Hg2+ is added alone. This indicates that SiNBIO could not be interfered
in recognizing Hg2+ in the presence of other interfering
metal ions and albumin. This is as expected because the material structure
of SiNBIT and SiNBIO is very similar.

Sensitivity of Fluorescent
Microspheres SiNBIO to Hg2+
As shown in Figure 6d, the fluorescence
spectra of SiNBIO in the presence of Hg2+ with different
equivalents were tested. As the concentration
of Hg2+ increases, the fluorescence intensity of SiNBIO
decreases and eventually quenches almost completely. Finally, when
the Hg2+ concentration is higher than 15 equiv, the fluorescence
intensity of SiNBIO does not change. Concentration-dependent fluorescence
signaling of SiNBIO to Hg2+ was obtained from Figure 6d and plotted in Figure 4d. Figure 4d shows K =
6.3267 for calculating the detection limit of SiNBIO for Hg2+.

By using the equation, LOD of SiNBIO to Hg2+ is
2.34 μM. Similar to SiNBIT, it can be seen from Figure 4d that when the concentration
of Hg2+ is in the range of 2.34–14 μM, the
fluorescence intensity changes linearly to recognize Hg2+.

Adsorption Properties of Fluorescent SiNBIO for Hg2+
The structure of SiNBIO is very similar to that of SiNBIT,
which is also reflected in the adsorption performance of SiNBIO for
Hg2+. The experimental results of Hg2+ adsorption
by SiNBIO are shown in Table 3. SiNBIO (50 mg) can absorb 49.4 mg of Hg2+ in
1 h, and the efficiency of adsorbing Hg2+ in 1 h is also
twofold of original SiO2. These performance data are very
close to that of SiNBIT, as expected. Each gram of SiNBIO microspheres
can remove 0.98 g Hg2+ ion, which shows a better performance
than the original SiO2.

Detection Mechanism of
SiNBB, SiNBIT, and SiNBIO by FTIR
To demonstrate the binding
mechanism of SiNBB, SiNBIT, and SiNBIO
to Hg2+ and Pb2+, Figure 7 shows the FTIR characterization of SiNBB,
SiNBIT, and SiNBIO combining with Hg2+ and Pb2+. In Figure 7a, SiNBB,
SiNBIT, and SiNBIO all have a characteristic peak of C=N bond
at 1638 cm–1. The infrared spectra of SiNBB + Hg2+, SiNBB + Pb2+, SiNBIT + Hg2+, and
SiNBIO + Hg2+ clearly show the vibrational band of the
C–O (H) bond at 1380 cm–1.35,36 This may be because while Hg2+ or Pb2+ is
coordinated to the nitrogen on C=N, the carbon on C=N
interacts with water to form C–O (H) and N bonds Hg2+ ions. This confirms that SiNBB selectively recognizes the binding
sites of Hg2+ and Pb2+ on the C=N bond.
At the same time, the FTIR spectra of SiNBIT + Hg2+ and
SiNBIO + Hg2+ exhibited a moderately strong peak at 800
cm–1 due to the binding of the C–S bond to
Hg2+. The combining site is proposed and shown in Figure 7b–d.

microspheres SiNBB, SiNBIT, and SiNBIO combined with Hg2+ and Pb2+. Structural representation of the binding sites

Cell Imaging Study
Cell imaging of SiNBB, SiNBIT, and
SiNBIO was done by using A549 cells. A549 cells were propagated in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin (100 μg/mL), and 1% streptomycin
(100 μg/mL). The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 37 °C incubator. Cellular fluorescence
imaging was taken by using a confocal microscope.

To demonstrate
the use of fluorescent microspheres in cell imaging applications,
their ability to detect Hg2+ in A549 cells was tested.
As shown in Figure 8b,c, cells were imaged in a green channel. Fluorescence images showed
that SiNBB could penetrate A549 cells through the cell membrane, which
indicated that SiNBB had good cell membrane permeability. In Figure 8, SiNBB shows green
emission in cells. Addition of Hg2+ caused a slight increase
in emission intensity, and the fluorescence turn-on is observed. Figure 8c shows that cells
treated with only SiNBB showed very weak fluorescence. However, when
Hg2+ (100 μM) were also treated in these cells, intracellular
fluorescence was significantly enhanced (Figure 8f). The changes in bioimaging of SiNBB at
different concentrations of Hg2+ (200 μM) were also
investigated (Figure 8g–i). These data demonstrate that microsphere SiNBB can be
used to monitor Hg2+ in living cells. In addition, SiNBIT
and SiNBIO cell imaging is shown in Figure S7. When Hg2+ was treated into cells, intracellular fluorescence
was significantly weakened (Figure 8f,i), which further confirmed the potential use of
SiNBIT and SiNBIO for cell imaging.

(10 μM) for 1 h. (d–f) A549 cells were treated with Hg(NO3)2 (100 μM) for 30 min, and then SiNBB (10

SiNBB (10 μM) was added for 1 h. (a,d,g) Bright-field images;

Hg2+ Imaging in Zebrafish
The 3–7-day-old
zebrafishes post-fertilization were obtained from China Zebrafish
Resource Center (Wuhan, China). The zebrafishes were cultured in 5
mL medium supplemented with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea in 6-well plates for
24 h at 30 °C. Five zebrafishes were first incubated with 10
μM SiNBB for 2 h. After washing three times by distilled water,
the zebrafishes were imaging in green channel. Then, 100 μM
Hg(ClO)2 was added into the zebrafishes for another 2 h.
Zebrafishes were imaging in a green channel after washing three times
by distilled water. All of the fluorescence images were acquired with
microscopy (Olympus SZX16, Japan).

In order to further confirm
whether SiNBB was suitable for imaging and detecting of Hg2+ in vivo, zebrafish was chosen as the animal models. As shown in Figure 9, the control group
(no Hg2+ was added) exhibited nearly no fluorescence. It
demonstrated that the microspheres SiNBB showed low background for
imaging in vivo. Additionally, after incubated with Hg2+, the green fluorescence displayed obviously enhancement which could
be observed by naked eyes. These results forcefully indicated that
microspheres SiNBB could perform Hg2+ imaging in living
organisms with high sensitivity.

Conclusions
In summary, pristine SiO2 microspheres
were prepared
and etched by NaOH to obtain mesoporous microspheres. Then, −CH2CH2CH2NH2 groups were introduced
into the porous microspheres, and small fluorescent molecules were
grafted by the LBL reaction method through −C=N–
formation reaction between −NH2 and −CHO
groups. Finally, three fluorescent microspheres SiNBB, SiNBIT, and
SiNBIO with excellent fluorescent and sensing properties were obtained.
The fluorescent microspheres SiNBB can selectively recognize Hg2+ and Pb2+, SiNBIT and SiNBIO are selectively sensitive
to Hg2+ ions. They all can remove Hg2+ ions
from the water with high efficiency. Meanwhile, all of the three fluorescent
microspheres can be used to monitor Hg2+ in living cells,
and the microspheres SiNBB can perform Hg2+ imaging with
high sensitivity in organisms. This work provides a facile method
to prepare microspheres for scientific research and real application.

Characterization
FTIR spectroscopy
was measured by
a Nicolet-6700 FTIR (Thermo) instrument in the range of 4000–400
cm–1. 1H NMR was measured by AVANCE III
600 MHz (Bruker). SiO2 microspheres were analyzed by TGA
(209F3 Tarsus [NETZSCH] Instrument, Frankfurt, Germany). The morphologies
of SiO2 before and after etching were obtained by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F; Tokyo, Japan).The element
and band diagrams were determined by XPS (PHI-5300; ESCA). Fluorescence
spectra were performed on a Shimadzu F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
UV–visible absorption spectra were measured on a UV-5900PC
spectrophotometer (METASH). Specific surface area and pore size distribution
of the microspheres were calculated by using the BET and BJH methods,
respectively. Adsorption of Hg2+ on different fluorescent
SiO2 microspheres was tested by atomic absorption spectrometry
ICE 3500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Synthesis of Fluorescent
Microspheres
BODIPY derivatives
B1 and BB were prepared according to the literature.37 BC was prepared from 5-bromoindole by the Vilsmeier–Haack
reaction. SiO2 microspheres are prepared, etched, and −NH2 group functionalized. Finally, fluorescent porous silica
particles were obtained by introducing fluorophores through the reaction
between −NH2 and BODIPY derivatives. The synthetic
route is shown in Scheme 1.
