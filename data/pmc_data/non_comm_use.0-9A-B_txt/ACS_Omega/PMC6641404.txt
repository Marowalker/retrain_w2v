The paramagnetic
spin relaxation filter is described for the rapid
NMR screening of intermolecular interactions between ligands and macromolecular
anionic receptors with large transverse relaxation enhancements (R2p). The addition of micromolar concentrations
of Gd3+ to the mixture produces the immediate broadening/suppression
of the NMR signals of interacting species while leaving unaffected
those of noncompetitive binders (one-dimensional and two-dimensional
experiments). The method is highly sensitive, unveiling interactions
that are too weak to generate changes in chemical shifts or relaxation
times. It is operationally very simple and hence, it is amenable to
ready implementation by nonspecialists. Examples of application such
as detecting the formation of interpolymer complexes, cyclodextrin
host–guest interactions, and the screening of DNA ligands are
included that demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability
of the method.

Introduction
NMR is a powerful tool
for the study of intermolecular interactions
in drug discovery and supramolecular chemistry. Various NMR-sensitive
parameters that change upon binding (chemical shifts, relaxation and
diffusion rates, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), or saturation transfer
effects) can be exploited as measures of the process.1 The enhancement of the transverse relaxation rate (R2 = 1/T2, where T2 is the transverse relaxation time) of low
molecular weight ligands binding to macromolecular receptors has been
widely exploited in recognition studies.2 The proportionality between R2 and the
spectral linewidth3 produces a selective
broadening in the resonances of binding ligands, which might even
be perceived in one-dimensional (1D) 1H experiments. For
small receptors and low affinity interactions, where broadening goes
unnoticed, sensitivity can be improved via filtered experiments (T2, or T1ρ,
the spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame).4 Still, the identification of binding is not always
straightforward due to small relaxation enhancements. To overcome
this shortcoming, Jahnke5 and others6 have described spin labels covalently bound to
protein receptors. This approach takes advantage of the faster relaxation
of nuclei in paramagnetic environments,7 an effect that is proportional to the distance between the spin
label and the active site where the ligand interacts. Related strategies
exploiting the paramagnetism of lanthanides complexed to proteins8 or ligands9 have also
been described to determine the three-dimensional structure of protein–ligand
complexes by analysis of pseudocontact shifts. Such schemes are, however,
very laborious for routine ligand screening. Not only does the paramagnetic
probe need to be covalently bound in advance, but this must also occur
in the proximity of the binding site/epitope. In this context, the
development of faster and more user-friendly NMR screening technologies
is highly demanded, especially for direct application by nonspecialists.

Our group has recently described the use of Gd3+ (S = 7/2, the largest spin moment among the elements; a high
electronic correlation time, τs, of ca. 10–8 s) as a paramagnetic spin relaxation (PSR) agent for the selective
signal broadening/suppression of certain components in mixtures according
to their Gd3+-complexing ability (1H and 13C PSR filter).10,11 The method relies on
the faster R2 of species in chemical exchange
with Gd3+,12 and it is compatible
with traditional relaxation and diffusion filters. The R2 of nuclear spins in a paramagnetic environment is given
by R2 = R2d + cR2p, where R2d is the transverse relaxation rate in the absence of paramagnetic
effects (R2d = 1/T2d), c is the concentration of the paramagnetic
agent, and R2p is the transverse relaxation
enhancement in the presence of the paramagnetic agent.13 We have disclosed that the PSR filter is dominated
by R2p (values in the range 0.1–20 000
s–1 mM–1, D2O, 500
MHz) rather than the original R2d (T2d) values, so that R2p represents a reliable and predictive tool for selective PSR suppressions.11 The higher the R2p of a component in a mixture, the easier its selective suppression
in 1D and two-dimensional (2D) PSR experiments. Bearing in mind that
anionic macromolecules (species with R2p > 1000 s–1 mM–1) can be suppressed
in the presence of any small molecule/polymer (R2p < 1000 s–1 mM–1)
by addition of μM concentrations of Gd3+ salts,11 we envisioned an application of the PSR filter
for the fast NMR screening of binding that avoids the necessity of
previous synthetic manipulations. It was hypothesized that Gd3+ could facilitate the identification of species interacting
with macromolecular receptors of high R2p by selectively enhancing their R2 values
(via a receptor-mediated paramagnetic effect) while leaving unaffected
the signals of noncompetitive binders.14 As a result, strong broadening effects or complete suppressions
should be expected, even for ligands that are too weak to generate
changes in the chemical shifts or relaxation times in the absence
of Gd3+.

Results and Discussion
To evaluate
the viability of the PSR filter as an NMR screening
technology, a sample composed of the oppositely charged polysaccharide
chondroitin sulfate (ChS, R2p 4616 s–1 mM–1) and glucosamine (GlcNH2·HCl, R2p 59 s–1 mM–1), a composition studied for the treatment
of osteoarthritis,15 was first considered
as a model system. Figure 1a,b shows the 1H NMR spectra of GlcNH2·HCl (10 mM) and ChS (10 mM disaccharide). Interestingly, the
spectrum of an equimolecular mixture of both components (10 mM each, Figure 1c) shows no change
in the chemical shifts or line broadening in the signals of GlcNH2 that could reveal the existence of an interaction with the
polysaccharide. Comparison of the 1H T2 of GlcNH2 (H2 in α- and β-isomers,
H2-α and H2-β) before (R = 0; R is the ChS/GlcNH2 molar ratio) and after (R = 1) mixing with ChS revealed virtually identical values
in complete agreement with this statement (Figure 2a,b). Nevertheless, a radically different
picture emerged after the addition of Gd3+ (200 μM)
to these solutions. Adding Gd3+ to GlcNH2·HCl
resulted in an unaffected 1H NMR spectrum of the monosaccharide
without loss of resolution, as expected according to its small R2p value (Figure 2c, spectrum with R = 0). Conversely,
the addition of Gd3+ to the mixture produced a nearly complete
suppression of the signals of ChS (compatible with its large R2p value), accompanied by a significant broadening
of the GlcNH2 signals, an effect indicative of an electrostatic
interaction between the components (Figure 1d). Indeed, analysis of the 1H T2 of GlcNH2 in Figure 2a,b reveals drastic reductions in T2 (more than 10-fold) when Gd3+ is
added to the ChS/GlcNH2 mixture, compared to only minor
effects when it was added to the monosaccharide solution. A study
on the variation of 1H T2 and
signal resolution of GlcNH2 in mixtures with increasing
concentrations of ChS (Gd3+ fixed at 200 μM) confirms
this effect at values of R as low as 0.1 (Figure 2). This example illustrates
the potential and simplicity of the PSR filter in revealing binding
interactions that are too weak to generate changes in the chemical
shifts or relaxation times.

The feasibility of the PSR filter was then evaluated with
intermolecular
systems of interest in the pharmaceutical/biomedical fields and supramolecular
chemistry. In the following sections, we describe its application
for ligand screening in interpolymer complexes (IPCs) and a macromolecular
cyclodextrin (CD) host. The technology is also revealed to be especially
suited for the screening of DNA ligands owing to the high R2p of the phosphated DNA backbone.

Interpolymer
Complexes
The selective association of
poly(carboxylic acids) and nonionic polymers [e.g., poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG), polyacrylamide, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide),
or poly(vinyl alcohol)] via hydrogen bonds results in the formation
of novel polymeric materials, known as interpolymer complexes (IPCs)
with promising applications in drug delivery.16 It has been reported that PEG (R2p 22
s–1 mM–1) forms pH-sensitive aggregates
when associated with poly(acrylic acid)17 (PAA, R2p 3000–17 000
s–1 mM–1 depending on Mw). However, disclosure of this interaction
is not evident by analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the
mixture (no signal broadening or variation of chemical shifts). Considering
the high R2p of poly(carboxylic acids)
(R2p > 1000 s–1 mM–1), we envisioned the application of the PSR filter
as an efficient strategy for the accelerated detection of IPCs using
a standard 1H NMR experiment.

Figure 3a shows the 1H NMR spectrum of
a ternary mixture composed of PAA450000 (0.3 mg/mL) and
PEG5000 (0.3 mg/mL) forming an IPC, accompanied by dextran66000 (0.75 mg/mL, R2p 31 s–1 mM–1) that does not participate
in the association. The NMR spectrum shows the signals expected for
the three individual components (broad signals for PAA at 1.5–2.6
ppm, a sharp singlet for PEG at 3.75 ppm, and various well resolved
peaks around 3.5–4.0 ppm for dextran) but no evidence for the
existence of an IPC. As predicted, the addition of Gd3+ (40 μM) to the mixture resulted in a nearly complete suppression
of the components that participate in the IPC (PAA and PEG via direct
and mediated paramagnetic effects, respectively) while leaving the
resonances due to dextran unaffected (Figure 3b). A more efficient suppression of the IPC
could even be obtained by the simultaneous implementation of a very
short T2-filter (e.g., Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
(CPMG)), complementing the selective paramagnetic R2 enhancement. As can be seen in Figure 3c, the broad residual signal from PEG observed
in Figure 3b could
be completely suppressed by application of a CPMG filter (10 ms),
which does not affect the resonances of dextran, the component not
participating in the IPC. We believe that the easy identification
of the IPC by the PSR filter will facilitate the characterization
of IPC-based hydrogels, layer-by-layer assemblies, and nanoparticles
of interest in drug delivery and materials science.

Host–Guest Complexes
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are
a family of cyclic oligosaccharides composed of a variable number
of 1,4 linked α-d-glucopyranose units. Because CDs
take the shape of a truncated cone with the central cavity having
a relatively lipophilic character, they have found application in
the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries due to their ability
to form inclusion complexes with a wide variety of hydrophobic guest
molecules.18 NMR is a privileged technique
to detect and study complexes of CDs. The fastest approach relies
on the observation of differences between the 1H chemical
shifts of the CD, guest, and the complex.19 Unfortunately, signal overlapping and small variations in the chemical
shifts often obscure an unambiguous identification of binding by 1H NMR. Because of their limited solubility in water (especially
β-CD, the most widely used member of the family), more soluble
derivatives, including carboxylated and sulfated CDs, have been developed
and are in common use.20 Considering the
large R2p value of these macromolecular
receptors [R2p 1534 s–1 mM–1 for sulfated β-CD (sβ-CD)] compared
to that of low molecular weight guest molecules, the PSR filter was
envisaged as a convenient technology for the fast and easy detection
of inclusion complexes, overcoming the aforementioned limitations
of conventional 1H NMR experiments.

As an illustrative
example, the inclusion complex of sβ-CD and 1-adamantanol (AdOH,
weak affinity ligand with KD of ca. 650
μM)21 was investigated in the presence
of a noncompetitive binder, methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside
(Glc-OMe). The experimental conditions for the preparation of the
inclusion complex are described in the Supporting Information (SI). The small variations observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of AdOH after binding hampered the identification
of the inclusion complex, which was nevertheless clearly verified
by a 1H–1H ROESY experiment (Figures S1 and S2 in the SI). Still, much easier
and more direct proof of complexation came from application of the
PSR filter. Figure 4a shows the 1H NMR spectrum of an equimolecular mixture
of sβ-CD, AdOH, and Glc-OMe, where characteristic signals due
to the three components are clearly identified. As can be seen in Figure 4b, the simple addition
of Gd3+ (400 μM) to the mixture allowed the easy
identification of the sβ-CD/AdOH complex via selective broadening
of their resonances while leaving completely unaffected those of Glc-OMe
(linewidth and chemical shift). Note that in the absence of sβ-CD,
the 1H signals of AdOH are not affected by the addition
of 400 μM Gd3+ (Figure S3). As in the example above, an even clearer picture of the selective
complex formation was provided by the simultaneous implementation
of a short CPMG filter (80 ms), which afforded a 1H NMR
spectrum of the nonbinding Glc-OMe ligand undistinguishable from that
of the pure compound (Figure 4c; unattainable spectrum with CPMG filters in the absence
of Gd3+). This combined PSR–CPMG strategy was also
applicable for the accelerated analysis of the 2D experiments 1H–1H COSY and 1H–13C HSQC of the mixture (Figure 4d–g), where identification of selective ligands
is highly facilitated compared to that by using 1D experiments; a
possibility envisioned to greatly facilitate the screening of large
libraries of ligands.

Figure 4 1H, COSY and HSQC spectra (D2O,
500 MHz,
300 K) of an equimolecular mixture of sβ-CD, AdOH, and Glc-OMe
(12 mg/mL) before (a, d, f) and after (b) the addition of Gd3+ (400 μM), and after the addition of Gd3+ (400 μM)
+ T2-filter (CPMG, 80 ms) (c, e, and g).

Interestingly, when, for comparison
purposes, NOE-based experiments
were undertaken, they were unsuccessful in the identification of the
sβ-CD/AdOH complex. Whereas WaterLOGSY22 was inconclusive, saturation transfer difference (STD)23 resulted only in internal transfer within sβ-CD.
The outcome of these experiments unveils the advantage of PSR for
the analysis of interactions with low molecular weight receptors,
which, having short correlation times, lack an efficient distribution
of magnetization through the spin system of dipolar coupled protons.
Because PSR does not require selective saturation pulses, another
advantage is its independence of spectral congestion, an important
issue when dealing with large libraries of compounds.

DNA Ligands
Next, we proceed to evaluate this technology
for the screening of DNA ligands. Because small molecules binding
DNA interfere in essential processes like gene expression and replication,
it is not surprising that they represent an effective source of anticancer,
antibiotic, and antiviral agents. DNA is nowadays the pharmacological
target of many drugs that are able to recognize DNA surfaces, bind
to specific regions, or intercalate at specific sequences.24,25 In this context, NMR stands out as a robust tool for ligand screening.25,26 Because the DNA backbone is composed of a phosphated deoxyribose
pattern with excellent Gd3+-complexing ability, the PSR
filter was foreseen to facilitate the screening of DNA ligands over
more established technologies.

To this end, we analyzed the
selective binding of Hoechst 33342 (H33342, a strong minor groove
ligand with KD 14 nM)27 to a duplex DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 in
the presence of three nonbinding molecules, namely, thiamine, adenosine,
and Glc-OMe.28Figure 5a,c shows the COSY and HSQC spectra (1H NMR in Figure S4a) of an equimolecular
mixture of dsDNA and the four ligands, which provide no clue about
the selective binding of H33342 (verified via a T2-filter experiment, Figure S5). Alternatively, the addition of minute amounts of Gd3+ (30 μM) to the sample afforded that information effortlessly.
A series of spectra was obtained where the signals of H33342 had been
selectively removed, leaving those of the nonbinding ligands untouched
(Figures 5b,d and S4b). Both 2D experiments illustrate the vast
selectivity and potential of the PSR filter for routine DNA screening
of large libraries of compounds. For comparison purposes, when a STD
was applied to the mixture, although the identification of H33342
was possible, the much higher sensitivity of PSR was revealed.

Figure 5 COSY and HSQC
spectra (D2O, 500 MHz, 300 K) of an equimolecular
mixture of d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2, thiamine, adenosine, Glc-OMe,
and H33342 (0.6 mM each) before (a, c) and after (b, d) the addition
of Gd3+ (30 μM).

To discard false PSR positives from nonbinding molecules,
which,
having large Gd3+-complexing abilities, could potentially
lead to broadening effects or signal suppressions in the absence of
binding, the dsDNA/H33342 system was evaluated under identical experimental
conditions as above in the presence of glucuronic acid (R2p 327 s–1 mM–1),
a non-DNA binder displaying one of the largest R2p values described.11 As expected,
the addition of Gd3+ (30 μM) to an equimolecular
mixture of the three components resulted in the selective and clean
suppression of H33342 (COSY and HSQC) without affecting the signals
of glucuronic acid (Figure S6). The fidelity
of PSR as a screening technology was also challenged by a competitive
experiment involving two ligands of dsDNA: H33342 (KD 14 nM)27 and a bisbenzamidine
of lower affinity (BBA, KD 724 nM).29Figure 6a,d shows the COSY and HSQC spectra of an equimolar mixture
of dsDNA and BBA, where signals due to the ligand are clearly identified.
The selective binding of BBA to dsDNA was easily confirmed via signal
suppression after addition of Gd3+ (30 μM) (Figure 6b,e). A subsequent
addition of an equimolecular amount of H33342 (higher affinity ligand)
to the mixture resulted in a BBA to H33342 replacement in the minor
groove, as evidenced by the reappearance of the BBA signals in both
spectra (Figure 6c,f).
Ultimately, uncomplexed BBA in solution is clearly visualized in the
NMR spectra, whereas the signals of H33342 complexed in the minor
groove are selectively suppressed via the receptor-mediated paramagnetic
effect. This experiment confirms the potential of the PSR filter to
monitor binding interactions in real time.

(D2O, 500 MHz, 300 K) of an equimolecular
mixture of d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 and BBA (0.6 mM each) before
(a, d) and after (b, e) the addition of Gd3+ (30 μM),
and after a subsequent addition of H33342 (0.6 mM) (c, f).

Conclusions
The paramagnetic spin
relaxation (PSR) filter is described as a
fast method for the NMR screening of intermolecular interactions.
The addition of micromolar concentrations of Gd3+ to macromolecular
receptors with large transverse relaxation enhancements (R2p) is exploited for the suppression/broadening of the
NMR signals of interacting ligands while leaving noncompetitive binders
unaffected (1D and 2D experiments). The PSR filter affords rich screening
information effortlessly, is operationally very simple, and so, it
is amenable to ready implementation by nonspecialists. The high sensitivity
of the method unveils interactions that are too weak to generate changes
in chemical shifts or relaxation times. The feasibility of the PSR
filter has been evaluated for ligand screening in interpolymer complexes
and a macromolecular cyclodextrin host. In addition, it has been revealed
to be especially suited for the screening of DNA ligands owing to
the high R2p of the phosphated DNA backbone.
These examples demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability
of the method for the fast NMR screening of intermolecular interactions.
Applications to alternative macromolecular receptors and supramolecular
structures are envisaged, including cages, calixarenes or peptide
nanotubes, among others.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All chemicals were purchased
from commercial sources and used without further purification. Gd2(SO4)3·8H2O was purchased
from Aldrich. d-Glucosamine hydrochloride, poly(acrylic acid)
(Mv 450 000, by viscosity), poly(ethylene
glycol) (Mn 4257, Mw 4867, by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight),
β-cyclodextrin sulfated sodium salt (sβ-CD), 1-adamantanol
(AdOH), 2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole, 2′-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-trichloride
(H33342), thiamine, and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside
(Glc-OMe) were purchased from Sigma. Adenosine was purchased from
Merck. Dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was purchased from Fluka (Mn 33 698, Mw 65 794, by gel permeation chromatography).
The oligonucleotide Drew-Dickerson DNA dodecamer CGCGAATTCGCG was
acquired from Thermo Scientific and biomers.net. Bisbenzamidine 4-([(3-([(4-carbamimidoylphenyl)amino]
methyl)phenyl) methyl]amino)benzene-1-carboximidamide (BBA) was kindly
donated by Prof. M. Eugenio Vázquez (CIQUS, Universidade de
Santiago de Compostela).29 Condrosan (Bioibérica
Farma) was used as the source of chondroitin sulfate. Each capsule
of Condrosan contains approximately 82% of a mixture of chondroitin
4- and chondroitin 6-sulfate (Mw 14 000–18 000)
and 18% magnesium stearate. The degree of sulfation of chondroitin
sulfate was determined as 67% by elemental analysis (N: 2.91%; S:
4.49%) using a LECO Elemental Analyze Model CHNS-932.

NMR Spectroscopy
Reported R2p values were determined
at 8 mg/mL in D2O (500 MHz) in
the presence of either 13 μM or 1 mM Gd3+.11 NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance
DRX-500 spectrometer of 11.7 T (1H frequency 500 MHz),
equipped with an inverse detection 1H/X broad-band BBI
probe with z gradients and operating under Topspin 1.3 software. Chemical
shift (δ) values are reported in ppm relative to the residual
water peak (HOD; δ 4.79) used as an internal standard. 1H–1H COSY experiments were acquired in magnitude
mode using the standard Bruker sequence “cosygp”. 1H–13C HSQC experiments were recorded using
the standard Bruker sequence “inviedgptp”. The 1H–1H ROESY spectrum was obtained using a
spin-lock time of 600 ms with the standard Bruker sequence “croesyprtp2”.

1H T2 values were determined
using the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) pulse
sequence [90°x – (τ – 180°y – τ)n, where
2τ is a fixed echo time (τ = 0.7 ms), n is the number of echoes, and 2τn is the total
echo duration] using 16 values of t, where t = 2τn, with a minimum value of
1.4 ms (n = 1) and the maximum is about 6–7
times the highest T2. Values of T2 are averaged among 2–3 experiments.
The interscan relaxation delay was larger than 5 times the highest 1H T1 in the sample. The absolute
signal integral intensity (I) at each value of 2τn was fitted to the applicable monoexponential eq 1 to determine the relaxation time T2. 1  1D and 2D T2-edited
experiments were performed by replacing the first 90° pulse by
the CPMG pulse sequence as previously described,30 using the same conditions as those described above (t = T2-filter).

Mestre
Nova 10.0.2 software (Mestrelab Research) was used for spectral
processing. When comparing spectra, the same number of scans and apodization
values were used. Residual HOD was attenuated in COSY experiments
by processing. OriginPro 9.0 Software (Originlab Corporation) was
used to perform the exponential fittings to obtain the relaxation
times T2.

Inclusion of 1-Adamantanol
in sβ-CD in the Presence of
Methyl-α-d-Glucopyranoside
In a test tube,
sβ-CD (80 mg, 24.1 mmol), 1-adamantanol (3.36 mg, 24.0 mmol),
and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (4.66 mg, 24.0 mmol)
were mixed in Milli-Q H2O (2 mL). The solution was kept
under stirring for 6 h at room temperature and then it was freeze
dried. Afterwards, 20 mg of the lyophilized solid was dissolved in
1 mL of D2O, and 300 μL of this solution was transferred
to an NMR tube. The final volume was made up to 500 μL with
D2O (final concentration of lyophilized mixture 12 mg/mL).

DNA Experiments
The oligonucleotide Drew-Dickerson
DNA dodecamer CGCGAATTCGCG (7.6 mg) was dissolved in D2O (760 μL) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. This solution
was allowed to slowly reach room temperature and it was used as the
stock solution. For NMR experiments, 217 μL of the stock solution
was transferred to NMR tubes, followed by a slow addition of the ligands
dissolved in D2O. Finally, D2O was added to
reach a 0.6 M solution of dsDNA and ligands.
