Visible-light communications (VLCs)
based on white light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) are emerging as a low-cost and energy-efficient alternative
solution to wireless communications. As white emitting LEDs use a
combination of a long-lived yellow emission combined with the faster
response of a blue emitting LED (∼460 nm), VLC technology
requires amplification of the blue component to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio. We report the fabrication and characterization of planar and
channel waveguides based on a blue-emitting polyfluorene conjugated
polyelectrolyte, namely, poly[9,9-bis(4-sulfonylbutoxyphenyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-phenylene] (PBS-PFP) incorporated into diureasil
organic–inorganic hybrids for optical amplification in VLC.
Taking advantage of the diureasil host as a UV self-patternable material,
direct UV laser writing was used to pattern channel waveguides
with a larger refractive index (Δn=0.09) compared
to the nonexposed region, enabling confinement and guidance of the
PBS-PFP emission with a maximum optical gain efficiency value of 1.62
± 0.02 cm μJ–1. This value is among the
best figures of merit known for polymeric materials with additional
advantages added by the diureasil hybrid host, namely, mechanical
flexibility, thermal stability, and low insertion losses due to the
nearly null refractive index contrast between the optical fiber and
the amplification device, establishing the proposed approach as a
promising cost-effective solution for optical amplification in VLCs.

Introduction
Recent advances in
light-emitting diode (LED) technology have created
a new generation of energy-efficient light sources that look set to
revolutionize the indoor lighting market.1 Modern LEDs can be rapidly modulated, presenting opportunities for
their future application in visible-light communications (VLCs), in
which the LED simultaneously functions as a light source and wireless
signal transmitter to transfer information at rates up to gigabits
per second.2 While inorganic materials
have traditionally dominated the fields of solid-state lighting and
optical communications, organic materials are rapidly emerging as
alternatives for applications where inorganics are not ideally suited,
such as those requiring large active areas, color tunability, or mechanical
flexibility.3−5 The wide-scale commercial availability of organic-based
LEDs is a prime example of how these key attributes can be successfully
leveraged.6,7

White-light emitting LEDs for
VLC can be produced in two ways:
a combined red–green–blue LED module, or alternatively,
a blue LED is coated with a phosphor color converter.8 Conjugated polymers (CPs) have recently been successfully
implemented as organic color converters to replace traditional inorganic
phosphor coatings.9−11 High absolute photoluminescence quantum yields
(PLQYs), tunable emission colors, and in particular, subnanosecond
emission lifetimes make CPs attractive for this purpose, since these
features enable higher communication bandwidths to be attained than
for conventional inorganic phosphors, which emit in the micro-millisecond
regime.12 Conjugated polymers have also
been used to prepare freestanding polymer membrane lasers13 or have been doped within polymer organic fibers
or slab waveguides to generate waveguide modulators14 and optical amplifiers.15−18 The latter operation was already
demonstrated for optical fiber communications, where the infrared
spectral component (1.3–1.5 μm) was amplified.19,20 For VLC, optical amplifiers are usually required to enhance the
blue component of the transmitting signal.2

Despite the ease of processability, the simultaneous
control
of both the morphology and electronic properties remains a significant
challenge for conjugated polymers. Optical loss mechanisms, such as
singlet-state annihilation and charge generation, are mediated by
interchain coupling,21 which becomes exacerbated
upon transfer to the solid state. Strategies for the control of intermolecular
interactions, while maintaining or even enhancing the optical properties
in the solid-state are thus highly desirable. We have recently shown
that incorporation of CPs into organosilica hybrid polymers known
as diureasils (Figure 1) is an effective approach to minimize interchain interactions leading
to highly emissive solid-state materials.22,23

structures of (a) diureasil (dU(600)) and (b) poly[9,9-bis(4-sulfonylbutoxyphenyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-phenylene] (PBS-PFP).

Moreover, diureasils are intrinsically photoluminescent,
emitting
in the purple–blue spectral region with a lifetime of nano-microseconds,24,25 and have a reasonable refractive index (n ∼
1.526), which enables them to be used as
waveguides for optical amplification,27 high-rejection optical filters,28 and
luminescent solar concentrators.29−33 Diureasils also offer acceptable absorption values
(1–5 dB cm–1 at 1550 nm) and low insertion
losses due to fiber–device refractive index mismatch.26 Electronic coupling between the CP and the ureasil,
combined with the formation of isolated polymer domains, leads to
the creation of localized radiative trap sites, which relax with a
PLQY of >0.60.22

Inspired by these
results, we postulated that the combination of
a short-lived CP, coupled with the waveguide characteristics of the
diureasil, could deliver a fast-response optical amplifier, suitable
for VLC. To minimize spectral losses, we chose to use the blue-emitting
poly[9,9-bis(4-sulfonylbutoxyphenyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-phenylene] (PBS-PFP, Figure 1), which exhibits good spectral overlap with the diureasil
and shows thermally assisted population of radiative trap sites.22 PBS-PFP is also water-soluble, thus affording
good compatibility with the aqueous sol–gel conditions used
to fabricate the diureasil (dU(600)). Moreover, we exploit the intrinsic
self-patternability of diureasils to fabricate optical architectures
within the CP–diureasil composites using direct UV laser writing
on the surface.34 We demonstrate that this
multipronged approach results in low-cost organic–inorganic
hybrid linear waveguides, which exhibit a maximum optical gain efficiency
of 1.62 ± 0.02 cm μJ–1.

Results and Discussion
Organic–inorganic hybrid materials incorporating PBS-PFP
have been synthesized by the versatile sol–gel methodology
at ambient temperature. Monolithic PBS-PFP diureasils are flexible,
transparent under daylight, and exhibit an intense blue emission under
UV radiation (365 nm), as shown in Figure 2a. The transparency was quantified by the
measurement of the absorption coefficient (α) from the UV/vis
absorption spectra that comprise a main absorption band in the UV
region (250–325 nm), assigned to the dU(600) host35 (Figure 2b), with a maximum absorption coefficient of ∼8.5 cm–1. After doping with PBS-PFP, although the host-related
absorption band still dominates the spectra, α decreases to
around ∼6.7 and ∼4.5 cm–1 for PBS-1
and PBS-2, respectively. Moreover, upon increasing the PBS-PFP concentration,
a new band peaking at 380 nm appears, which is ascribed to the polyfluorene
absorption.36 For all samples, for wavelengths
longer than 400 nm, α is very low (<0.1 cm–1), providing transparency under daylight.

(c, d) Emission spectra excited at 365 nm and (e, f) the corresponding
excitation spectra monitored at 435 nm for monoliths (M) and films
(F). The dashed line represents the typical emission of the commercial
InGaN-based LED used to produce the commercial solid-state LEDs.37

Upon excitation at 365 nm, PBS-PFP diureasil monoliths reveal
a
structured emission band between 390 and 550 nm (Figure 2c), which is characteristic
of the vibronic relaxation of the polyfluorene excited singlet state.30 However, the contribution of the intrinsic emission
of dU(600)35 to the spectrum cannot be
neglected as it also occurs in the same spectral region (Figure 2c). Comparing the
emission spectra of the samples processed as monoliths with those
in films (Figure 2d),
while those for the low-concentrated film (PBS-3-F) resemble the emission
spectra of the monoliths, the emission spectra of the more concentrated
films (PBS4-F and PBS-5-F) are shifted to the blue region, revealing
additional variations in the relative intensity of the vibronic progression
components. In any case, we note that as desirable for VLC, the blue
emission of the PBS-PFP diureasils overlaps that of the InGaN-based
LED used to produce the commercial solid-state LEDs, whose white light
results from the mixture of the blue emission arising from high-efficiency
LEDs and yellow-emitting YAG:Ce phosphor.38

The contribution of both the dU(600) and PBS-PFP excited states
to the observed blue emission is also inferred from the excitation
spectra monitored around 435 nm (Figure 2e,f). The spectra are dominated by a band
between 300 and 450 nm, assigned to overlapping contributions from
PBS-PFP and the dU(600) host, and a weaker component around 275 nm.
However, variations in the relative intensity and bandwidth of the
peaks are observed as a function of the PBS-PFP wt %. As noted above
for the more concentrated films, the excitation spectra differ from
those of the monoliths and the low-concentration film. These observations
can be attributed to a combination of factors. First, the processing
methodology used can lead to distinct kinetic control of the sol–gel
process, in particular differences in the gelation times (hours for
the bulk and seconds for the films), which is known to modulate the
degree of organization of the dU(600) host material.39−41 Thus, both the monolithic and film samples are expected to provide
a distinct host environment for the PBS-PFP chains. Second, while
PBS-PFP is soluble in dilute solutions of mixed polar solvents (such
as the tetrahydrofuran (THF)/water mixture used to prepare the samples),
it tends to form dispersions of supramolecular aggregates in pure
water.42,43 Thus, preferential evaporation of THF during
the gelation and drying processing steps will gradually induce a local
concentration gradient in the samples, leading to an increasingly
more aqueous environment, in which chain entanglements will be favored.
This process will occur more rapidly for the films and for samples
with a higher PBS-PFP wt %, although electrostatic/polar interactions
with diureasil and other siliceous hosts have been shown to control
the extent of aggregation of conjugated polymers at the organic–inorganic
interface.30,44,45 From Figure 2e,f,
at the lowest PBS-PFP concentration in both the film (PBS3-F) and
monolith (PBS1-M) samples, the excitation and emission spectra are
reminiscent of well-dissolved PBS-PFP chains, with some excitation
of the PBS-PFP emission arising from energy transfer from the dU(600)
host.22 As the concentration is increased
in the monoliths (e.g., PBS2-M), the excitation spectrum indicates
an increase in the electronic interaction between the host–guest
species, while the band broadening and change in the vibronic structure
in the emission spectrum suggest increasing aggregation of the PBS-PFP
chains. In the film samples, the effect of aggregation becomes even
more apparent, with the red shift in the emission band and change
in the relative intensity of the vibronic peaks indicative of self-absorption
(usually designated as inner-filter effect).46

The photoluminescence quantum yields obtained on excitation
at
365 nm are shown in Table 1 and reveal a significant increase as a function of increasing
PBS-PFP wt %, reaching 0.411 ± 0.005 and 0.759 ± 0.008 for
PBS1-M and PBS2-M, respectively. Independently of the concentration,
the films reveal lower photoluminescence quantum yield values
in comparison to those found for the monoliths, despite the same trend
of increase being observed with the PBP-PFP wt %, achieving a maximum
value of (0.011 ± 0.001) for PBS5-F. The  dU(600) monolith
exhibits a PLQY of 0.179 ± 0.002, which is in good agreement
with previously reported values.22 The
increase in PLQY with the concentration reflects the significant contribution
of the PBS-PFP to the photoluminescence as the host reveals intrinsically
lower values. This enhanced PLQY in the blue spectral region renders
it easier to excite the samples using commercial UV-emitting LEDs,
showing the potential of the material to be integrated with VLC as
an optical amplifier.

To further characterize the optical
features of these materials,
the refractive index (n) was monitored by spectroscopic
ellipsometry. The measured ellipsometric parameters Is and Ic and the respective
fits are represented in Figure S1 (Supporting
Information (SI)). The resulting dispersion curves are shown in Figure 3a and show that the
refractive index increases with PBS-PFP wt %, yielding a refractive
index difference at 450 nm of +0.01 between PBS2-M and dU(600) and
of +0.02 between PBS5-F and dU(600). The increase in the refractive
index upon addition of PBS-PFP is expected as conjugated polymers
are known to have a refractive index value >1.6,47 larger than that of the nondoped dU(600).26,48

Dispersion curves for (a) pristine monolithic and film samples and
(b) channel waveguides in PBS2-M as a function of the laser pulse
energy used in the writing system (30–120 μJ pulse–1).

As mentioned above, one
of the advantages of using the diureasil
organic–inorganic hybrid as a host is the possibility to locally
control the refractive index through UV exposure by direct writing
with a UV pulsed laser.26 Taking this feature
into account, n was studied as a function of the
UV pulsed laser energy (μJ pulse–1) through
ellipsometric measurements in the exposed regions. The measured ellipsometric
parameters Is and Ic, and the respective fits are represented in Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting Information). As an illustrative
example, Figure 3b
presents the dispersion curves for UV-exposed regions of PBS2-M, revealing
a refractive index increase with the UV dose used in the exposition.
A positive refractive index contrast between the exposed and nonexposed
regions (Δn) was observed, yielding a maximum
Δn of +0.09, at 450 nm, for a UV dose of ∼120
μJ pulse–1. The dispersion curves for the
exposed regions in PBS1-M (Figure S4, Supporting
Information) also reveal a positive refractive index contrast, yielding
a maximum value for Δn of +0.03 at 450 nm.
Thus, the refractive index of the PBS-PFP-based diureasils  can
be easily tuned through chemical (PBS-PFP doping) and physical (UV
exposure) parameters, in which the UV-exposed region can be assumed
to behave as channel waveguides. Then, using UV laser writing, channel
waveguides were patterned on the surface of the monoliths, yielding
a length of ∼2 × 10–2 m and a width
of ∼2.00 × 10–4 m. An optical microscopy
image of a channel waveguide written with 120 μJ pulse–1 on the PBS2-M surface under UV illumination is shown in Figure 4b. We note that the
thin films, without UV exposure, behave as planar waveguides, where
the propagation occurs without lateral confinement.

optical gain in PBS-PFP diureasils using the

in the planar waveguide PBS2-M and channel waveguide written with

Since these materials have a high
PLQY and show a positive Δn, the optical gain
was measured by applying the variable
stripe length technique in the planar and channel waveguides, using
the experimental setup represented in Figure 4a. The emission spectra were acquired for
a stripe length range of 0.0–2.5 × 10–2 m, with a step of 5 × 10–4 m. As a representative
example, Figure 4c,d
shows the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra for the planar
waveguide PBS2-M and for the channel waveguide written with 120 μJ
pulse–1 on PBS2-M.

Figure 5a,b shows
the respective ASE integrated intensity versus the stripe length for
the planar and channel waveguides produced with PBS2-M. The emission
spectra and the respective integrated intensity for PBS1-M and the
channels written in PBS1-M and PBS2-M are in Figures S5–S8 (Supporting Information). An increase in the ASE
emission with the excitation length is clearly observed. This behavior
can be described by a one-dimensional optical amplifier rod, where
the propagation equation for the ASE intensity, IASE, taking into account the gain saturation, can be written
as49 1  where g0 is the
optical gain coefficient, Isat is the
signal saturation intensity, Asp is the
spontaneous emission rate, N0* is the
excited-state population density, and hν is
the energy of the emitted photon.49 Ω
is the solid angle defined by the output side of the amplifier and
the slit on the sample surface (Figure 4a), and for simplicity, it is set to be constant.49 Integration of eq 1 leads to eq 2, from which it is possible to extract the optical gain coefficient
by the fitting to the experimental data. 2  where  is the intensity of the spontaneous emission
and W is the Lambert function. The gain values obtained
for the planar waveguide monoliths are represented in Figure 5c, which show an increase of
the optical gain values by increasing the polymer concentration in
the diureasil. The maximum optical gain obtained was 15.0 ± 0.2
dB (35.0 ± 0.1 cm–1) for PBS2-M.

ASE intensity as a function of the stripe length

PBS2-M surface, respectively. Calculated optical gain coefficients
as a function of (c) PBS-PFP concentration (wt %) in the diureasil,
and (d) refractive index contrast (Δn) at 450
nm between the channel and planar waveguides regions.

Using the same approach, the optical gain coefficient
was also
calculated for the channel waveguides. Figure 5d shows the optical gain values obtained
for the channel waveguides written on PBS1-M and PBS2-M surfaces,
which reveals an increase in gain with increase in Δn. The maximum gain obtained was ∼34.0 ± 0.2
dB (78.0 ± 0.1 cm–1) for the channel with Δn = 0.09 in PBS2-M. The gain increase in the channel waveguide
samples results from the confinement of the radiation, and therefore
by the increase of the population inversion. Concluding, similarly
to the refractive index, the optical gain can also be defined through
chemical (PBS-PFP doping) and physical (UV exposure) parameters.

Furthermore, to assess the optical propagation and net gain in
the channel waveguide, a probe optical signal (λ = 450 nm) was
coupled to the channel input. Signal propagation through the waveguide
was attained, and an optical fiber was aligned to the channel output
extremity to measure the output emission spectra, using a spectrometer.
As a representative example, Figure 6a shows the spectra obtained at the output for the
channel waveguide with Δn = 0.09 in PBS2-M.
The spectra were taken, independently, without pump excitation, and
with UV excitation through an external perpendicular pump source placed
above the channel waveguide, and a UV pump co-propagating with the
probe optical signal. From the spectra, an intensity improvement was
observed when the waveguide was excited, especially for external perpendicular
pumping. The spectra obtained at the waveguide output for PBS1-M and
PBS2-M are represented in Figure S9 (Supporting
Information), and also reveal an improvement in the emission intensity
when the waveguide was excited.

output with Δn = 0.09 in PBS2-M (the photodiode
operates with an output capacitor, removing the DC component). (c)
Gain calculated for each waveguide channel written on the PBS2-M surface,
for planar excitation (red line) and co-propagation excitation (blue
line).

To further evaluate the channel
waveguides, the net optical gain
(dB) was calculated. The probe optical signal was modulated in intensity
with a square waveform (50% duty cycle) at 200 Hz using a mechanical
chopper. The output signal was detected by a photodiode connected
to an oscilloscope. As an example, the signal transmitted in the waveguide
with Δn = 0.09 in PBS2-M is represented in Figure 6b without pumping,
with external perpendicular pumping, and with co-propagation pumping.
Again, an improvement in the intensity is observed when the waveguide
is exposed to UV radiation, mainly when the excitation is external.
The net gain values were estimated from the ratio between the peak-to-peak
voltages of the received signal with and without pumping. Using the
two pumping approaches, the maximum gain observed was in the waveguide
with the higher refractive index contrast (Δn = 0.09), yielding values of ∼32 and ∼16 dB, with external
and with co-propagation pumping, respectively (Figure 6c). The received signals of the waveguides
in PBS1-M and PBS2-M, and the respective net gain values for PBS1-M
are represented in Figures S10 and S11 (Supporting
Information).

The gain efficiency  was calculated, in which pump indicates
either the pump signal energy density (ηG, μJ
cm–2) or power density (η′G, kW cm–2), to enable a comparison with previous
studies reported in the literature.

In this work, light propagation
and amplification was attained
with high optical gain efficiency values that envisage application
of the proposed devices for VLC applications. In particular, to the
best of our knowledge, larger or similar optical gain values were
only achieved for pure polydioctylfluorene (PFO)50 and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-9,9-di(4-methoxy)phenylfluorene)
(F8DP),51 which has higher processing cost
than our PBS-PFP-diureasil hybrid. We note that compared to other
hybrid materials, the gain efficiency values obtained are among the
best previously reported in the literature (Table 2). The highest gain efficiency values, calculated
through the energy density, were 0.73 ± 0.01 and 1.62 ±
0.02 cm μJ–1 for planar (PBS2-M) and channel
waveguides (Δn = 0.09 in PBS2-M), respectively,
which are among the best values reported in the literature for pure
polymers (Table 2).

As the gain efficiency values are comparable to those
previously
reported for both pure conjugated polymers and hybrid materials, PBS-PFP
diureasils are a promising cost-effective solution for optical amplification
in white light-emitting diodes for VLC.

Conclusions
Planar
and channel waveguides based on PBS-PFP doped within diureasil
organic–inorganic hybrids were fabricated and optically characterized
with the view of their potential application as optical amplifiers
for VLC based on white light-emitting diodes. From the efficient and
 synergetic energy transfer between the diureasil-excited
states and those of the PBS-PFP, an enhanced high-efficiency and stable
emission in the blue spectral region (peaking around 390–550
nm) occurs, which overlaps that of commercial solid-state LEDs used
for VLC.

We give emphasis to the heavily facilitated control
of the surface
optical properties by the inherent flexibility offered by these materials
that are easily self-patterned by UV exposition laser writing, in
contrast to traditional lithographic processes. Therefore, the refractive
index of the PBS-PFP-based diureasils can be facilely tuned through
chemical (PBS-PFP doping) and physical (UV exposure) means. This characteristic
was exploited to pattern channel waveguides on the surface of PBS-PFP
diureasil monoliths using direct UV laser writing, and radiation
confinement was observed.

The optical gain coefficient was measured
using the variable stripe
length method, showing an increase in optical gain with the PBS-PFP
concentration and with the irradiated UV energy amount. To further
evaluate the channel waveguides, the net gain was measured, using
an optical signal peaking at 450 nm coupled in the input, transmitting
bits, showing an intensity improvement when the waveguides were exposed
to UV radiation.

The maximum gain efficiency value observed
in planar waveguides
was 0.73 ± 0.01 cm μJ–1 (14.6 ±
0.2 cm kW–1), which corresponds to the sample with
the highest PBS concentration (PBS2-M). In the channel waveguides,
the highest gain efficiency obtained was 1.62 ± 0.02 cm μJ–1 (32.5 ± 0.3 cm kW–1) for the
channel with Δn = 0.09 in PBS2-M when it was
excited above the channel.

These values are among the best known
for conjugated polymers and
hybrid materials. To the best of our knowledge, larger values were
only achieved for pure PFO, which has a higher processing cost than
the hybrid material, showing the potential of the proposed material
to be implemented as a cost-effective optical amplifier for VLC based
on white light-emitting diodes.

Methods
Materials
Poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-bis-(2-aminopropyl
ether) (Jeffamine ED-600), 3-isocyanatoproplytriethoxysilane
(ICPTES), ethanol (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade),
hydrochloric acid (37% Puriss), potassium bromide (Fourier transform
infrared grade), acetonitrile (HPLC grade), and 1,4-dioxane (HPLC
grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (99.9%) was obtained from Fischer Scientific and used as received.
Poly[9,9-bis(4-sulfonylbutoxyphenyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-phenylene] (PBS-PFP) with an Mn of
6500 g mol–1 by gel permeation chromatography (∼740
g mol–1 repeat units) was a kind gift from Dr. Ana-Teresa
Marques and Prof. Ullrich Scherf at Bergische Universität Wuupertal
and was synthesized as previously reported.42

Synthesis of PBS-PFP Diureasils
PBS-PFP diureasil composites
were prepared via the previously reported direct insertion method.22 This method involves mixing a fixed volume of
a stock solution of PBS-PFP in 1,4-dioxane/water (25:75 v/v) with
a diureapropyltriethoxysilane (d-UPTES) precursor solution, before
inducing acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of the siliceous
backbone to obtain the final PBS-PFP diureasil composite. The d-UPTES
precursor was obtained by dissolving Jeffamine ED-600 (1 mL, 1.75
mmol) in THF (5 mL), to which ICPTES (0.9 mL, 3.0 mmol) was added
under stirring. This mixture was refluxed at 70 °C for 24 h to
obtain the d-UPTES precursor solution. The required volume of the
PBS-PFP stock solution was then added to obtain the required PBS-PFP
wt % in the final material. In the case of the undoped reference diureasil
(denoted as dU(600)), an analogous volume of solvent (1,4-dioxane/water
(25:75 v/v)) was added for consistency. The sol–gel reaction
was triggered by the addition of ethanol (0.409 mL, 7 mmol), HCl (0.5
M, 0.040 mL), and H2O (0.095 mL, 5.3 mmol) to the d-UPTES
solution. This corresponds to a ratio of 1 ICPTES:2.3 EtOH:1.8 H2O:0.006 HCl molar equivalents. The samples were prepared as
either freestanding monoliths or thin films. To obtain the monoliths,
the solution containing the gelation agents was transferred into a
polypropylene mold, which was then covered with Parafilm M. After
24 h, Parafilm M was pierced to encourage slow evaporation of the
solvent, after which it was placed in an oven at 40 °C for 48
h to complete the drying process, producing a freestanding, transparent
monolith (∼3 mm thick). PBS-PFP-dU(600) films were prepared
by spin-coating a fixed volume of the solution onto SiO2/Si (300 nm thick SiO2 layer) substrates. The spin rate
was varied to change the film thickness (∼101 μm).
The samples are designated as PBSx-M or PBSx-F for monoliths and films, respectively. The weight percent
(wt %) of PBS-PFP incorporated in each sample is indicated in Table 1, and further information
of the specific sample thicknesses can be found in Table S1 (Supporting Information, SI).

Production of Channel Waveguides
Linear waveguides
were patterned on the surface of the monoliths by direct laser writing,
using an UV pulsed laser (Coherent Bragg-Star Industrial V2.0) operating
at 248 nm with a frequency of 900 Hz, focused through an objective
lens (Thorlabs, LMU-15X-248). The monolith was moved by a PC-controlled
stage (Newport, XPS and MFA-CC) at a translation velocity of 0.1 mm
s–1 on the double-axis translation system. For each
monolith, five different waveguides were written with energies of
30, 60, 80, 100, 120 μJ pulse–1.

Optical Characterization
UV/Vis
Absorption Spectroscopy
UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature, using a dual-beam
Lambda 950 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with a 150 mm diameter Spectralon
integrating sphere or STD detector module over the scan range (250–1600
nm) and a resolution of 2 nm. The absorption coefficient (α,
cm–1) was estimated for all of the monoliths using
the Beer–Lambert equation (α = A/t, where A and t are the
absorbance and thickness, respectively, of each sample).

Photoluminescence
Spectroscopy
The emission and excitation
spectra were recorded at room temperature using a FluoroLog3 Horiba
Scientific (model FL3-2T) spectroscope, with a modular double-grating
excitation spectrometer (fitted with a 1200 grooves mm–1 grating blazed at 330 nm) and a TRIAX 320 single emission monochromator
(fitted with a 1200 grooves mm–1 grating blazed
at 500 nm, reciprocal linear density of 2.6 nm mm–1), coupled to a R928 photomultiplier (visible measurements), using
the front-face acquisition
mode. The excitation source was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. The emission
spectra were corrected for detection and optical spectral response
of the spectrofluorimeter, and the excitation spectra were corrected
for the spectral distribution of the lamp intensity using a photodiode
reference detector.

Absolute Emission Quantum Yield
The absolute photoluminescence
quantum yield (PLQY) values were measured at room temperature using
a C9920-02 Hamamatsu system. The method is accurate within 10%.

Spectroscopic Ellipsometry
Spectroscopic ellipsometry
measurements were performed using a Horiba Scientific AutoSE spectroscopic
ellipsometer at an incidence angle of 69.8°, and an average of
30 measurements per point, for the spectral region between 400 and
850 nm. A measurement spot area of 2.50 × 2.50 (×10–4 m2) was used. On the basis of the layered
structure, a model consisting of a four-layered system incorporating
two layers for the substrate (Si/SiO2), the doped diureasil
layer and air as the ambient medium was considered in the ellipsometric
data analysis, for the thin-film samples. The data were minimized
using the Simplex algorithm, and the dispersion curves were determined
using the Cauchy absorbent model, which expresses the refractive index
(n) as a function of the wavelength (λ) described
by 3  where A, B, and C are constants and the wavelength is expressed
in μm. The reported values for the thickness and refractive
index are the average of three measurements performed for each sample
with a maximum standard deviation of 5%. For the monoliths with thickness
higher than 10–5 m, the samples were considered
as bulk materials, and the data were minimized using the direct inversion
technique, through the above-mentioned Cauchy absorbent model.

Variable
Stripe Length Gain Measurement
The optical
gain was measured using the variable stripe length (VSL) method. A
narrow stripe on the sample surface was optically excited and the
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) signal intensity (IASE) was collected from the edge of the sample as a function
of the stripe length (L).49 To have a narrow stripe on the sample surface with a variable length,
a slit (aperture of 1.5 × 10–3 m) and a movable
shutter connected to two translation stages (Thorlabs, 13 mm) were
used, allowing the stripe length to be controlled within the limits
2.5 ≥ L ≥ 0 (×10–2 m). To detect the IASE, an optical fiber
(Quartz fiber, SMA MMF) and a spectrometer (MAYA Pro 2000, Oceans
Optics) were used. The emission spectra were acquired with an integration
time of 5 s and 15 scans excited with a UV pump (Vilber VL-6.LC) emitting
at 365 nm.

Optical Net Gain Measurements
The
optical net gain
of the channel waveguide was measured in the spectral domain for a
continuous wave diode laser emitting at 450 nm (Roithner LD 450-1600MG).
The experimental setup used is represented in Figure 7. The laser signal was coupled to an optical
fiber aligned with the channel waveguide using a positioning system
(Thorlabs, NanoMax-TS). The propagated signal was collected at the
channel output using the above-mentioned positioning system and spectrometer,
with an integration time of 10–2 s and an average
of five scans.

Figure 7 Scheme of the experimental setup used to measure the net
gain with
a modulated optical signal for the two pumping strategies (external
perpendicular or co-propagating).

The net gain was also measured in the time domain using a
modulated
optical signal, pulsed with a mechanical chopper (MC1F10HP, Thorlabs).
For this characterization, the waveguide output optical signal was
aligned to a photodiode (DET210, Thorlabs), connected to an oscilloscope
(MSO7014B, Agilent Technologies). These measurements were performed
under daylight and for two independent optical pumping (UV excitation)
configurations: (i) externally to the channel using a UV pump (VL-6.LC,
Vilber) as an external waveguide perpendicular pumping architecture
or (ii) with an optical signal from a UV-emitting diode (MCLS LED
365, Ocean Optics), injected in the channel input as a co-propagation
pumping architecture. This pumping solution provides a compact and
integrated system.
