Solar
energy-driven practices using semiconducting materials is
an ideal approach toward wastewater remediation. In order to attain
a superior photocatalyst, a composite of g-C3N4 and ZnO (GCN–ZnO) has been prepared by one-step thermal polymerization
of urea and zinc carbonate basic dihydrate [ZnNO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3. The GCN–ZnO0.4
sample showed an evolved morphology, increased surface area (116 m2 g–1), better visible light absorption ability,
and reduced band gap in comparison to GCN–pure. The GCN–ZnO0.4
sample also showed enhanced adsorption and photocatalytic activity
performance, resulting in an increased reaction rate value up to 3
times that of GCN–pure, which was attributed to the phenomenon
of better separation of photogenerated charge carriers resulting because
of heterojunction development among interfaces of GCN–pure
and ZnO. In addition, the GCN–ZnO0.4 sample showed a decent
stability for four cyclic runs and established its potential use for
abatement of organic wastewater pollutants in comparison to GCN–pure.

1 Introduction
Visible light-driven photocatalysis
to degrade organic water pollutants
is a cheap, clean, and convenient alternative to other water pollution
abatement strategies using chemical, biological, and physical methods.1 A semiconductor material can act as a photocatalyst
on absorbing a photon of energy equivalent to the energy of its band
gap, producing electron–hole pairs, which are then separated
and transferred to the target pollutant for the redox reaction.2−4 g-C3N4 (GCN) has evidenced as a potential
metal-free photocatalytic material having a visible light-responding
band gap (2.7 eV) responsive for numerous applications such as chemical
sensors, photovoltaic solar cells, water splitting, and pollutant
degradation.5−11 In addition, it has high chemical and thermal stabilities.12,13 However, the hindered marginal absorption of light and the low surface
area are two major factors, which can lower the efficiency of GCN
in visible light.14,15 Various studies reported that
the morphology of GCN nanostructures plays a vital role in determining
the photocatalysis performance. Also, it has been emphasized that
the type of precursor used for synthesizing GCN and the molar ratio
of the dopant can affect the crystal structure and photocatalytic
performance of modified GCN because of distinguished reaction pathways
and degrees of condensation between the two. Our previous study reported
enhanced photocatalytic degradation efficiency toward the methylene
blue (MB) dye on using urea-derived GCN over other precursors.16 Dong et al. reported that urea-derived GCN showed
better interaction with sodium nitrate, over melamine and dicyanamide,
as a precursor, leading to the emergence of nanocomposites with a
better morphology, surface area, and porosity and better photocatalytic
activity of the nanocomposites toward degradation of tylosin.17 Mishra et al. reported effective interaction
among thin GCN nanosheets from the urea precursor over thiourea with
TiO2/bentonite toward photocatalytic degradation of the
reactive brilliant red-X3BS dye.18

Formation of composites among GCN and other metal-oxide semiconductors
is one of the most effective and convenient method among other modification
techniques as it can overcome the problem of rapid recombination of
photo-generated charge carriers and also enhance the response of the
photocatalyst toward light.19−25 Recently, ZnO-modified GCN has been reported to exhibit prominent
catalytic properties. Yue et al. has reported dicyandiamide and zinc
chloride-derived ZnO–GCN with improved photoactivity.26 Liu et al. has reported a GCN/Vo–ZnO
hybrid photocatalyst using Zn(OH)F and melamine, which resulted in
enhanced photoactivity for organic pollutants.27 Mohammad et al. has reported a ZnO–CN nanohybrid
utilizing urea and [Zn(hmp-H)2(H2O)(μ-Cl)Zn(μ-Cl)(Cl)3] with enhanced photocatalytic degradation property toward
organic pollutants.28 Zhu et al. has reported
dicyanamide and zinc nitrate-derived GCN–ZnO composites resulting
in better photocatalytic ability toward degradation of the MB dye.29 Chidhambaram and Ravichandran has reported urea
and zinc nitrate hexahydrate-derived ZnO–GCN nanocomposites
with improved photoactivity.30 Moussa et
al. has reported ZnO–GCN composites using melamine and Zn(OAc)2 with enhanced activity toward organic dye degradation.31 Similarly, Li et al. has reported a GCN@ZnO
photocatalyst utilizing urea and diethyl zinc for enhanced cephalexin
degradation.32 It can be deduced after
analyzing from the above discussion that it might be possible to further
promote the photocatalytic activity via judicious selection of the
precursors used to synthesize the ZnO–GCN composite system.
To analyze this hypothesis, we have made an attempt to prepare a GCN–ZnO
composite using urea and zinc carbonate basic dihydrate [ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3. In this
study, the GCN–ZnO composite has been synthesized in a facile
manner using the thermal polymerization reaction between urea and
zinc carbonate. All obtained samples were compared for the photocatalytic
activity potential toward degradation of the MB dye in its aqueous
solution. A noticeable improvement in the photoactivity of modified
GCN has also been observed. Further, the pH effect of the reaction
solution on the rate of MB dye degradation and on the photocatalyst
stability was also studied. A viable mechanism for improved photocatalytic
activity of ZnO-modified GCN has also been explored.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction Study
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns (Figure 1) for samples GCN–pure, GCN–ZnO0.2, and GCN–ZnO0.4
showed a strong peak at 27.3°, which corresponds to the (002)
plane, and revealed graphitic stacking of C3N4 in GCN–pure and GCN–ZnOx composite
samples.33,34 The intensity of the (002) peak was found
to decrease with increasing content of [ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3 in the precursor system, which
states that the introduction of ZnO could restrict GCN–pure
crystal growth.26,35 Another smaller intense peak
appeared at 13.1° corresponding to the (100) plane and could
be attributed to an in-plane structural packing motif of GCN, such
as the hole-to-hole distance of nitride pores.36 The decrease in intensity of the smaller peak on addition
of ZnO indicated strong association between the GCN–pure host
and introduced ZnO, which distorted the nitride pore structure and
altered the hole-to-hole distance.26,37 Pure ZnO showed
peaks corresponding to the wurtzite hexagonal phase of zinc oxide.38 No other peaks of ZnO were observed in any of
GCN–ZnOx samples, which possibly had resulted
due to the low amount of ZnO in GCN–ZnOx composites.
In the case of GCN–ZnO0.6, the characteristic peak at 27.3°
reduced a lot that it did not appear well.26 This suggests that when the amount of ZnO precursor added initially
was raised to 0.6 mmol, the innate structure of GCN–pure could
not be retained well.

GCN–ZnOx samples.

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Analysis
Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) analysis (Figure 2) revealed C and N bonding in GCN–pure
and GCN–ZnOx samples. In the case of GCN–pure,
a broad band at 3180 cm–1 appeared because of N–H
groups and the hydroxyl group of adsorbed H2O molecules.39,40 Several peaks from 1630 to 1200 cm–1 can be assigned
to aromatic C–N stretching modes caused out of extended C3N4 arrangement.41 The
intense band at 811 cm–1 indicated the out-of-plane
bending vibration of triazine rings.42 Characteristic
bands for the ZnO sample appeared in the range of 550–450 cm–1 corresponding to the Zn–O bond vibration,
and another band around 3420 cm–1 corresponds to
the hydroxyl group stretching vibrations.43 For GCN–ZnOx samples, all characteristic
peaks related to GCN–pure appeared. The characteristic bands
of the Zn–O bond vibration appeared around 497, 516, and 528
cm–1 for GCN–ZnO0.2, GCN–ZnO0.4, and
GCN–ZnO0.6, respectively. The intensities of peaks at 1630–1200
cm–1 decreased, and also the peaks were found to
be getting merged to a broad absorption band with increasing ZnO content
as a result of ZnO crystallization.44 Also,
the band at 811 cm–1 was red-shifted to lower wavenumber,
which suggested weakening of the bond strength of C=N and C–N,
indicating stretching caused in the conjugated system, which resulted
in a wider conjugated system of GCN–pure and ZnO in GCN–ZnOx.26 Formation of a new peak
around 2180 cm–1 took place and was also found to
be getting more intense with increasing ZnO concentration. This indicates
the formation of new C–N bonds instead of sp2 C–N
bonds; triazine units generally consist of sp2 C–N
bonds such as N=C–N and C–N=C, but ZnO
addition causes breakage in most of triazine units.43 The above result further indicated that simultaneous crystallization
of ZnO could interfere with urea thermal polymerization leading to
a partially deteriorated graphitic structure of GCN–pure, which
is also consistent with the XRD analysis result.45 Poor crystallinity observed for GCN–ZnOx composites could result in more defects related to the GCN phase,
and such a condition might play a vital role in promoting its activity
as a photocatalyst.44,46

2.3 Microscopic Analysis
Morphological
and microstructural aspects of samples were analyzed using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
A distinct morphology was observed in the case of GCN–pure
and GCN–ZnO0.4. The SEM image (Figure 3a) of GCN–pure layered structure was
found to be identical to the stacked layer morphology of urea-derived
GCN reported previously.45 In Figure 3b, it was observed
that after addition of ZnO in GCN–pure, GCN–ZnO0.4 evolved
into a slacked interlinked network consisting of elongated fibers
with a mean diameter of 20–60 nm. SEM analysis indicated that
the interaction of [ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3 with urea led to the formation of a loose structure
of GCN–ZnO0.4 with an increased surface area and porosity,
which probably happened due to the influence of released gases during
the thermal polymerization reaction. In addition, Figure 3d presents the high-resolution
TEM (HR-TEM) image of GCN-Zn0.4, confirming the simultaneous existence
of ZnO and GCN phases, and lattice fringes having a d-spacing of 0.26 nm could be attributed to the (002) plane of hexagonal
wurtzite ZnO, whereas Figure 3c shows a single GCN phase in GCN–pure.32,44 Energy-dispersive system (EDS) patterns of GCN–pure and GCN–ZnO0.4
are shown in Figure 4c,f respectively. EDS patterns for GCN–pure revealed that
it consisted of elements C and N, whereas GCN-ZnO0.4 contained C,
N, Zn, and O elements. Further from Table 1 it can be noticed that C/N at. % ratio was
0.85 in the case of GCN–pure, whereas for GCN–ZnO0.4,
the ratio was found to be increased to 1.5. This observed change could
be a possible representation of the removal of some nitrogen from
the GCN–pure framework on addition of [ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3 by deamination during
the thermal polymerization reaction. Elemental mappings of N, C, Zn,
and O shown in Figure 4e were found to be well defined and showed a sharp contrast. Homogenous
and effective distribution of ZnO elements could be observed throughout.
The results further assured the successful formation of the GCN–ZnO
composite.

2.4 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further taken
into consideration to assure the presence of ZnO in the prepared sample
(Figure 5a–e).
A full survey scan (Figure 5a) confirmed the existence of N, C, O, and Zn in the GCN–ZnO0.4
sample. C 1s peaks observed in the short scan (Figure 5b) could be differentiated into four main
peaks, with 287.4 eV depicting C–N–C bonds, 285.8 eV
attributed to sp3 C–N bond, 288.1 and 284.7 eV indicating
sp2-bonded carbon (N=C–N) and aromatic C
atom in the s-triazine ring, respectively.26,29,47 For the N 1s spectrum in Figure 5c, the peak at 398.7
eV originated from C=N–C, indicating the presence of
triazine rings, and a weak peak signal at 400.02 eV depicted tertiary
N atoms (N-(C)3).29,32 For the O 1s spectrum in Figure 5d, the peak at 529.8
eV correlates with O2– ions in Zn–O bonding
and the peak at 531.1 eV corresponds to the OH group adsorbed on the
composite surface.31,47 In the case of the Zn 2p spectrum
(Figure 5e), the peaks
at 1043.9 and 1020.9 eV correlated with Zn 2p1/2 and Zn
2p3/2, respectively, representing typical Zn–O bonds.
Also, the binding energy difference between these two peak signals
is 23 eV, holding good agreement with the ZnO standard reference value.29 The XPS analysis further confirmed the association
of ZnO with GCN.

2.5 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
Thermal
stability and estimation of the GCN content in the obtained samples
were done through the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 6). TGA spectra were found to
consist of two stages of weight loss. The major weight loss was observed
from about 520–710 °C, which is related to the combustion
of the GCN phase.44 Thus, from this weight
loss phenomenon, the weight percentage of GCN and ZnO (GCN %/ZnO %)
was estimated to be 69.21%/19% in GCN–ZnO0.2, 63.86%/26.9%
in GCN–ZnO0.4, and 52.6%/35.4% in GCN–ZnO0.6.29 Based on the above calculation, the corresponding
content of ZnO in the total amount of samples obtained (Table 5) was estimated to be 0.098,
0.156, and 0.230 g, which is quite comparable to the expected theoretical
value of 0.081, 0.162, and 0.244 g corresponding to the amount of
ZnO precursor used for the synthesis of GCN–ZnO0.2, GCN–ZnO0.4,
and GCN–ZnO0.6, respectively. A minor weight loss of 11.5–16.4%
at the lower temperature range probably resulted because of desorption
of surface moisture and other organics present over the surface of
samples.31

2.6 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller Analysis
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 7a,b) were analyzed
for GCN–pure and GCN–ZnO0.4 samples. A type III curve
with a hysteresis loop was observed for both the samples.48,49 Multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) plots (Figure 7c) were considered
to calculate the specific surface area, and the surface area of GCN–ZnO0.4
(116 m2/g) was nearly 1.5 times greater than that of GCN–pure
(74 m2/g). The increased surface area is a clear outcome
of morphological evolution caused because of the association of ZnO
with GCN–pure, which could have led to the degradation of graphitic
arrangement of the GCN–pure structure because of nitrogen loss,
leading to an increased surface area, which is also consistent with
the results of SEM and EDS mapping analyses. Further pore size distribution
for GCN–ZnO0.4 and GCN–pure, as shown in the inset of Figure 7a,b, was also estimated
with the help of the Barret–Joyner–Halenda method using
the isotherm adsorption branch. For both the samples, the pore diameter
was estimated to be in the range of 3–10 nm, depicting their
mesoporous nature. The specific surface area, pore volume, and size
of samples are represented in Table 1.

GCN–ZnO0.4
and (b) GCN–pure. (c) BET adsorption isotherm of GCN–ZnO0.4
and GCN–pure.

2.7 Ultraviolet–Visible
Spectroscopic Analysis
Optical performance of all samples
was analyzed using an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectrometer (Figure 8a). The absorption edge of
GCN–pure was found to be getting red-shifted from 456 to 490
nm, and the absorbance intensity got more pronounced with increasing
content of [ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3 added to urea initially. The equation, α = A(hν – Eg)n/hν,
where α is the absorption coefficient, was applied for band
gap calculations.50 The band gap energy
of ZnO, GCN–pure, GCN–ZnO0.2, GCN–ZnO0.4, and
GCN–ZnO0.6 was estimated to be 3.28, 2.72, 2.62, 2.56, and
2.52 eV respectively, as shown in Figure 8b. The reduced band gap energy of GCN–ZnOx could lead to better absorption of light in the visible
region favoring more e–h+ pair formation, thus probably
resulting in improved photoactivity.33

diffused absorbance spectra and (b) band gaps
of ZnO, GCN–pure, and GCN–ZnOx samples.

2.8 Photocatalytic Activity
2.8.1 Effect of Dopant Concentration
All samples were examined
for their photocatalytic potential toward
the photodegradation of MB dye solution (Figure 9a,b). GCN–ZnOx samples
expressed enhanced photoactivity over GCN–pure and ZnO. The
adsorption–desorption equilibrium could reach in 20 min, and
adsorption shown by GCN–pure, GCN–ZnO0.2, GCN–ZnO0.4,
and GCN–ZnO0.6 was 23.6, 49.8, 45.3, and 34% toward MB dye
solution. Adsorption could possibly be the result of the mesoporous
nature of the samples (GCN–pure and GCN–ZnO20.4), as
evident from the results of the BET analysis, and supports the process
of heterogeneous photocatalysis. Also, increase in the adsorption
percentage for GCN–ZnO0.4 in comparison to GCN–pure
is consistent with the results of respective specific surface areas
of both the samples. The photodegradation efficiency was calculated
by considering the initial amount of dye left after adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. Photocatalytic degradation curves of MB dye solution
using GCN–ZnO0.2, GCN–ZnO0.4, GCN–ZnO0.6, GCN–pure,
and ZnO are shown in Figure 10a–e, where UV–vis absorption peaks for MB for
all degradation curves (except for ZnO) are found to show a noticeable
blue shift (maximum blue shift of 664–651 nm for GCN–ZnO0.4)
after 30 min of irradiation time. This observation also states the
difference between the MB absorption curve during adsorption and the
photocatalytic degradation process. In the case of ZnO, the photocatalytic
degradation efficiency was found to be only 12.3%, which is due to
its optical property that might show an absorbance potential suitably
in the UV spectrum range. GCN–pure showed a good potential
and degraded the MB dye up to 53.1%. GCN–ZnO0.2 and GCN–ZnO0.4
composites showed an enhanced degradation potential of 78 and 90%,
respectively, in comparison to GCN–pure. The order of photocatalytic
activity, GCN–ZnO0.2 > GCN–ZnO0.4 > GCN–pure,
was found to be consistent with the order of their calculated band
gap energies. In the case of GCN–ZnO0.6, a decrease in photoactivity
was observed, which might be due to the existence of surplus defects
within the GCN phase of GCN–Zn0.6 acting as the site of e––h+ recombination and thus suppressing
the transfer frequency of photo-induced charges. GCN–ZnO0.4
showed the highest value for the apparent rate constant, resulting
in an increment of 3.2 times in comparison to GCN–pure, as
shown in Table 2. Comparison
of GCN–ZnO0.4 with other similar reported systems of GCN–ZnO
composites has been discussed in Table 3.

2.8.2 Effect
of pH of the Solution
The
GCN–Zn0.4 sample showing the highest photoactivity was further
analyzed for the effect of pH of the solution on its photoactivity
(Figure 11a,b). Initial
pH of the MB dye solution containing the photocatalyst was set from
pH 4 to pH 11. When pH of the solution was increased above the normal
range to alkaline medium, the photodegradation of MB increased, and
it decreased when pH was set to the acidic range below the normal
pH condition. Also, it showed the highest photodegradation potential
at pH 10, whereas at pH 11, the photodegradation potential showed
a decrement. Based on the well-established fact of dependency of surface
zeta potential of the photocatalyst on the pH value of the solution,
the zeta potential of the GCN–Zn0.4 sample was measured, as
shown in Figure 11d, and was found to be influenced by the MB dye solution pH, as shown
in Figure 11c.51 The zeta potential value of GCN–Zn0.4
was found to be 5.91, 3.42, −8.69, −11, −21.7,
and −17 mV for solution pH of 4, 5, 7.6, 9, 10, and 11. The
increased negative surface charge of the photocatalyst in alkaline
medium would enhance the adsorption of positively charged MB dye molecules,
which would further facilitate its photodegradation.51,52 At an optimum pH condition, degradation of MB reached 97% in 80
min, and the apparent rate constant value increased 1.8 times in comparison
to normal pH condition. The apparent rate constant value and the degradation
efficiency for GCN–ZnO0.4 measured for all photocatalytic reactions
for 80 min at the pH range 4–11 are represented in Table 4.

2.8.3 Reusability
Experiment
The stability
of the fabricated GCN–ZnO0.4 sample was checked by conducting
recyclability and reusability experiments for four cyclic runs as
shown in Figure 12. The photocatalyst in use was re-collected at the end of every photocatalytic
experimental run and reused for the next cycle by keeping other conditions
same. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency was found to be almost
the same for all reactions, and a minor decrement in activity with
every cyclic run could be attributed to the loss in the amount of
photocatalyst during the process of recollection.

2.8.4 Proposed Mechanism for Enhanced Photocatalytic
Activity
As per the above discussion, the GCN–ZnO0.4
composite sample resulted in enhanced adsorption and photoactivity
than GCN–pure. This response could be because of two main evolutionary
processes between the two variants, that is, increased surface area
and smaller band gap, which support the phenomenon of synergism between
adsorption and photocatalytic process. Increased surface area in the
case of the GCN–ZnO0.4 sample can provide more active sites
during the photocatalytic reaction, thus producing more photogenerated
electrons, and it can also lead to lower recombination of photogenerated
charge carriers.53 For the demonstration
of the role of active species involved in the photodegradation of
the MB dye, trapping experiments were performed. Ascorbic acid (AA,
0.1 mM), methanol (M, 10 mM), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, 10 mM), and ammonium oxalate (AO, 10 mM) were
utilized as superoxide O2•– radicals,
hydroxyl •OH radicals,, electrons (e–), and holes (h+) scavengers, respectively, and degradation
of MB dye was observed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer after
120 min of visible light irradiation.31,54 It can be
observed in Figure 13 that AO hindered photoactivity noticeably, suggesting the main role
of h+ in the photodegradation process. AA and methanol
hindered photoactivity to a lesser extent, showing that the •OH and O2•– reactive species
are not mainly involved in the degradation process. Contrarily, no
hindrance in photoreduction was observed in the presence of K2Cr2O7, suggesting the minimum role played
by e– in the photodegradation process. Adding further,
as shown in Figure 14 the conduction band (cb) edge of ZnO (−0.5 eV) lies within
the valence band (vb) (+1.4 eV) and cb (−1.3 eV) of GCN–pure,
thus forming a temporary trapping site for photogenerated holes and
electrons because of incorporated ZnO, which could trap the photo-induced
electrons transferred to the cb of GCN–pure from the vb under
visible light irradiation.55,56 Simultaneously, holes
from the vb of ZnO get injected to that of GCN–pure.26 Thus, GCN–ZNO0.4 could lead to improved
photo-generated charge carrier separation, hence encouraging the process
of interfacial electron transfer. The electron acceptors, existing
in the system or absorbed on the surface of ZnO, such as O2, react with trapped electrons, undergoing photoreduction to form
reactive oxygen radicals •O2–. This is because the O2/O2– redox potential lies at −0.33 eV.57 The redox potential of •OH/OH– lies at +1.99, and therefore, the photogenerated holes on the GCN
surface cannot react with•OH– or
H2O molecules to form •OH radicals.58 In turn, the holes in the vb of GCN can possibly
oxidize the MB dye, as supported by the effect of AO causing hindrance
to photoactivity. This improves the transfer of charge carriers, and
the recombination of photo-generated e––h+ pairs is effectively delayed by ZnO doping. This can be explained
with the help of equations below59              

Figure 13 Influence of hole, electron, •OH, and O2•– scavengers on the
degradation of MB dye
after 120 min of visible light irradiation.

Figure 14 Proposed
photocatalytic mechanism showing the separation and transfer
of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over the GCN–ZnO
photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.

Thus, both increased surface area and enhanced visible light absorption
ability in the case of the GCN–ZnO0.4 sample can lead to better
degradation efficiency toward the MB dye.

3 Conclusions
The GCN–ZnO composite was prepared in
a facile manner and
characterized using FTIR, XRD, SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), XPS, differential reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and BET analyses.
The strong coordination of ZnO with GCN–pure and partial deterioration
of the crystalline structure of GCN–pure on addition of ZnO
were indicated by XRD and FTIR analyses. BET and DRS analyses revealed
that the GCN–ZnO0.4 composite resulted in an enhanced surface
area and visible light absorption ability, leading to increased active
sites, photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and reduced frequency
of photo-induced charge recombination, which in turn leads to a better
photoactivity potential. GCN–ZnO0.4 resulted in an increment
in the value of apparent rate constant by 3.2 times over GCN–pure
toward degradation of the MB dye and could be further explored for
various other environmental applications.

4 Experimental
and Characterization Details
Zinc carbonate basic dihydrate
[ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3 and urea (CH4NO) were purchased from
Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. and Thermo Fisher Scientific
India Pvt. Ltd. respectively. A typical procedure to prepare the GCN–ZnO
composite has been reported in Figure 15. The yellow-colored solid sample was procured
and further processed into a fine powder. The samples were labelled
as GCN–ZnOx, where x represents
the amount of [ZnCO3]2·[Zn(OH)2]3 in mmol put initially in urea (10 g). Table 5 represents the amount of sample obtained in context to synthesized
GCN–pure and GCN–ZnOx samples. Pristine
GCN (GCN–pure) and ZnO were prepared likewise by directly heating
their respective precursors.

Figure 15 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of
GCN–ZnOx samples.

Table 5 Amount of Sample Obtained
s. no.	sample name	amount obtained
(g)	
1	GCN–pure	0.34	
2	GCN–ZnO0.2	0.52	
3	GCN–ZnO0.4	0.58	
4	GCN–ZnO0.6	0.65	
Further samples were characterized using a Rigaku
Ultima IV diffractometer
equipped with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å) for XRD analysis.
FTIR analysis was done using a PerkinElmer Frontier FTIR spectrometer.
DRS spectra was obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer from
Japan. SEM analysis was done using an EVO LS 10 microscope. TEM was
done using a Tecnai G2 20 (FEI) S-Twin (200 kV) transmission electron
microscope. XPS analysis was performed on an ESCA+ Omicron Nanotechnology
Oxford Instrument (1486.6 eV). BET surface area and pore analysis
were done using a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at liquid
nitrogen temperature (77 K). TGA was carried out using a TA SDT Q600
instrument in a N2 atmosphere using α-Al2O3 as the reference and heating @ 10 °C min–1.

Photocatalytic degradation of MB dye solution was carried
out at
room temperature in a photoreactor containing two tungsten lamps (200
W) (with a 420 nm cutoff filter), fixed on opposite walls, as the
visible light source. Light source intensity was determined by a power
meter (14.45 mW/cm2). Typically, 0.01 g of the photocatalyst
was added to MB dye solution (10 ppm) in a conical glass beaker (250
mL) and kept for stirring in the dark to reach adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. During the experiment, 5 mL of suspensions were taken
out in intervals of 10 min and centrifuged for photocatalyst separation;
then, the suspensions were analyzed for absorbance measurements using
a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The photocatalytic degradation
efficiency and the apparent rate constant of the degradation process
of the dye were estimated following the information given in our previously
published work.16
