Foaming
of oils often confronts researchers in food, cosmetics,
and petrochemical industries. Destabilization or stabilization of
nonaqueous foams is fundamentally crucial for process control and
product quality. Antifoams can be a useful method to control excessive
foams. Nonetheless, the foaming mechanisms and the selection criteria
of the most common antifoam, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) oils, are
not thoroughly discussed. The study of inorganic colloidal particles
as foam stabilizers has drawn particular attention over the past years
practically and academically, yet only a small part of literature
focuses on nonaqueous foams. For these reasons, we have studied the
effects of PDMS oils and silica nanoparticles on the foaming of oils.
We find that the performance of silicone oils as crude oil antifoams
is firmly related to PDMS viscosity and crude oil composition presumably
because the solubilization of PDMS oils in hydrocarbons reduces with
increasing viscosity of the polymers and the hydrocarbons. The findings
also illustrate that nanoparticle hydrophobicity and concentration
are the primary factors for the foam stabilization effect.

1 Introduction
Many processes of industrial
production produce foam. The existence
of foam may adversely affect the safety and economy of the production
process. For example, the wet desulfurization plants can experience
overflowing foams due to the slurry in the absorbing tower, which
is harmful to the stable operation of the desulfurization system.1 In the pulp and paper industry, the use of cellulose-based
materials for papermaking involves stirring and turning the surfactant-containing
pulp slurry, which leads to the generation of unwanted bubbles and
thus damages the process of papermaking.2 Similar problems emerge in textile washing, waterborne latex paints
and varnishes, and some medical applications.3 In the oil and gas industry, although it has been reported that
annular foam and foamy oil are beneficial for pipeline transportation
of heavy oil,4,5 some stages suffer from foam production.
For example, agents for drilling are usually surfactants, which when
mixed with the hydrocarbon gases, CO2 and H2S, will produce much foam and severely decrease the drilling speed.6 Another stage of oil and gas production that
suffers from problems of excessive foam is gas–oil separation.7 Crude oil foaming is detrimental to efficient
degassing and effective process control. The problematic situation
of unwanted foams so commonly arises in the industrial world that
we must consider it seriously to overcome these shortages.

Silicone
foam control agents prove to be economical and simple
and are commonly used in a wide range of industrial processes to suppress
and eliminate foams.8−10 Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) oils are the most common
chemical foam control agents, and fluorosilicone fluids are used in
some severe cases to provide foam control at small dose levels.11 PDMS oils are versatile and practical for both
aqueous and nonaqueous systems. The selection of ideal PDMS oil type
and dose level is dependent on the properties of the foam system.
Researchers have proposed several mechanisms governing the behavior
of antifoams. Harkins and Robinson defined the spreading and entering
coefficients, and Ross introduced the idea of comparing the sign of
the spreading coefficient to determine the antifoam activity.12−14 Garrett pointed out that foam film rupture in some systems was caused
by the bridging mechanism and positive values of bridging coefficient
corresponded to film rupture.15,16 Pugh and Denkov rigorously
studied the mechanisms of foam destruction by antifoams.17,18 Denkov tested the entry barriers of oily antifoams with the film-trapping
technique. His work demonstrated that the entry barrier was crucial
to the antifoam efficiency, and antifoams with low entry barriers
(less than 15 Pa) were fast antifoams, which caused film rupture in
seconds. Bridging–dewetting or bridging–stretching was
the possible mechanism involved in film rupture by fast antifoams.18 Early literature demonstrated that PDMS oil
spreading pressure correlated positively with antifoam efficacy.19,20 Due to the spread of the PDMS oil on the surface, the surface tension
of the foaming system reduced after equilibration. All the above mechanisms
regarding antifoam liquid oils for aqueous systems can be extended
to nonaqueous systems generally and especially to crude oils.3 The definitions of the three classical coefficients
for estimation of antifoam performance are given in eqs 1–3, where σ is the interfacial tension between two immiscible
phases and the subscripts g, a, and o are abbreviations for gas, antifoam,
and oil phases.15 Positive values of these
coefficients do not necessarily guarantee foam suppression, but they
are essential for the application of antifoams, as more positive coefficients
are usually linked to more likely antifoaming behavior.19,21 Other considerations must be accounted for regarding crude oil foams.
Differences in sizes of antifoam drops may affect the probability
of effectiveness. However, it is hard to predict the size distribution
and the aggregation state of the antifoam drops.22 Additionally, the solubility of the antifoams in the medium
and the presence of solids or gels on the lamellae are of cardinal
importance.23,24 There is evidence that the composition
of crude oil (including the dissolved low-molecular-weight gaseous
components) can affect the solubility of PDMS (and derivatives). Therefore,
working with real gaseous components at high pressure and temperature
is better at revealing the antifoam performance. Furthermore, the
downstream effects of the additive are crucial for the selection of
crude oil antifoams.25,26 1   2   3  When product purity is of significant concern,
antifoams may bring in a source of irreversible contamination. In
this regard, mechanical defoaming methods have unique advantages compared
to chemical foam-breaking methods. The most common arrangement of
mechanical defoaming devices is the rotary unit, such as rotating
disks, centrifugal baskets, spinning cones, and cyclones.27 These devices lack consensus on the ideal design.
However, most of the designs involve the use of centrifugal, shear,
and impact forces to enhance liquid redistribution.3 Low-viscosity foams are reported to be successfully destroyed
with ultrasound in the textile and dairy industries, whereas this
technique is less successful for medium-viscosity foams produced from
vinyl chloride based adhesives.17 A theory
held that foam drainage was enhanced when cooperating waves squeezed
liquid from the film into the node.28 Experiments
by Winterburn suggested that rupture front breakage dominated the
collapse of foam under the influence of ultrasound.29

Stabilization of emulsions and foams with particles
has long been
observed by Ramsden and Picking.30,31 However, the
role of solid particles to stabilize air bubbles in surfactant-free
systems has just been elucidated recently.32−35 The innovative work on phase
inversion of particle-stabilized materials from aqueous foam to dry
water and from nonaqueous foam to dry oil is done by Binks and Murakami.36,37 Binks illustrated that phase inversion can be induced by varying
the particle hydrophobicity or the air/water ratio. The transitional
hydrophobicity is approximately 20% SiOH for fumed silica particles,
whereas the preparation of oil marbles (oil in air materials) requires
the elaborate design of oil-repellent surfaces by creating surface
roughness. Gonzenbach reported an in situ hydrophobization approach
to tune surface-wetting properties through short-chain amphiphilic
molecules with high solubility in the aqueous phase.38 He later applied this approach to the modification of particles
with different isoelectric points.39 Thomas
suggested that particles of suitable hydrophobicity (33% SiOR) exhibit
maximum ability to stabilize air bubbles when a high concentration
of NaCl (3 mol/dm3) was added.40 Nonaqueous systems stabilized by particles were investigated by
Amro, who used either dichlorodimethylsilane-coated fumed silica or
organo-modified laponite clay as colloidal particles.41

This work aims to explore the effect of PDMS oils
as crude oil
antifoams and investigate the stabilization of nonaqueous foams by
silica particles. We defined four parameters to characterize the effect
of PDMS oils and silica nanoparticles on crude oils. The results are
significant for understanding and controlling crude oil foams in the
oil and gas industry. Furthermore, the study can help understand the
role of inorganic colloidal particles on nonaqueous foams. Thus, potential
applications in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics can benefit from this
study.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Development
of the Experimental Program
The crude oil properties are
listed in Table 1.
We used poly(dimethylsiloxanes) (PDMS oils)
of different viscosity as crude oil antifoams. Antifoam properties
are given in Table 2. We prepared silica nanoparticles of different hydrophobic grades.
It can be seen from Figure 1 that the hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles progressively
increases from 0 to roughly 152°, indicating that particle hydrophobicity
increases progressively. Figure 2 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the silica nanoparticles with different hydrophobicities. The particles
tend to agglomerate in the air due to surface forces.42 We characterized the stability of the foam by performing
the pneumatic test with the apparatus illustrated in Figure 3.25,43−47

2.2 Effect of Poly(dimethylsiloxanes)
Figure 4 shows the
excellent suppression of crude oil foam by homogenizing 5 wt % PDMS
S1000 in oil sample 1. Figure 4a shows the evolution of foam volume against time without
the additive. Figure 4b shows the equivalent time-lapse images after the homogenization
with the additive. The new dispersion system shows a lower level of
foamability in contrast.

Figure 4 Time-lapse images of foaming of 1 oil without
(a) and with (b)
PDMS oil S1000.

In Figure 5, the
points that are on the right-hand side of the break position indicate
viscosity for effective antifoams. Figure 5a shows that antifoamability effect (AE)
generally has a positive correlation with PDMS viscosity. The break
position in the x-axis marks the transition from
ineffective antifoam to effective antifoam. Antifoams S10 and S50
have negative AE, whereas others have positive AE. The critical viscosity,
in this case, is the minimum viscosity for PDMS oils to act as effective antifoam.
As the viscosity increases from 150 to 1000 mPa s, AE increases from
63 to 94%.

Figure 5 Antifoamability effect and destabilization effect (AE and DE) versus
poly(dimethylsiloxane) viscosity: (a) 4 oil, (b) 1 oil, (c) 2 oil,
and (d) 3 oil.

Foam characterizations
of 5 wt % poly(dimethylsiloxanes)/oil systems
were further conducted to investigate the antifoam performance on
crude oils. The antifoamability and destabilization effects correlate
positively with poly(dimethylsiloxane) viscosity for all crude oils
in general. Antifoam performance on oil sample 1 versus PDMS viscosity
is shown in Figure 5b. When PDMS viscosity is 1000 mPa s, AE and DE are more than 90%.
The antifoam performance of oil sample 2 as a function of PDMS viscosity
is shown in Figure 5c. The critical viscosity is between 10 and 50 mPa s. S150, S500,
and S1000 show more than 90% increase in AE and DE. The antifoam performance
of oil sample 3 as a function of PDMS viscosity is shown in Figure 5d. The critical viscosity
is between 10 and 50 mPa s, and good antifoam performance (both AE
and DE are around 90%) is achieved with S150. When the viscosity of
the oil sample increases, AE and DE of S50 increase from negative
to positive. This trend suggests that the critical viscosity of effective
antifoaming PDMS oils may increase with crude oil viscosity.

The antifoam performance as a function of PDMS concentration is
shown in Figure 6,
which shows that AE and DE are almost directly proportional to the
PDMS concentration between 0.1 and 0.5 wt %. It is noteworthy that
PDMS oils can be distinguished as fast antifoams (effective in less
than a minute) for oil foam inhibition, suggesting that they have
low entry barriers.18 From a probabilistic
point of view, it is speculated that PDMS oil tends to spread on the
surface with a higher probability if the antifoam concentration is
high. Therefore, the increases in the probability of an antifoam drop
arriving in a foam film may explain that the antifoam effect increases
with increasing concentration of antifoam. The more dilute the antifoam
dispersion, the fewer the drops and the lower the probability of antifoam
action. Besides, differences in the sizes of individual drops may
affect the probability of effectiveness even when they are present
in a foam film.

effect
on poly(dimethylsiloxane) concentration.

Some relevant observations are similar to the experimental
results
in this study. The earliest reference to the PDMS oils as profoamers
for nonaqueous foaming systems can be traced back to half a century
ago by Shearer.48 Centers observed a similar
phenomenon regarding the profoaming effect of PDMS oils on a synthetic
ester turbine lubricant.49 L’Hostis
and Renauld reported increased antifoam effectiveness of PDMS oils
with increasing viscosity.50 Pape reported
improved foam control of crude oil with PDMS oil of molecular weight
more than 1 900 000. He cited that antifoam performance
on the Ekofisk platform in the North Sea was boosted 4-fold by increasing
the PDMS viscosity from 12.5 to 60 Pa s.51 Callaghan showed that the antifoaming effect of PDMS oil turns to
profoaming effect if sufficient short-chain alkanes were added to
the dead crude oil.52

On the one
hand, it was revealed by Mannheimer that the solubilization
of PDMS oils in hydrocarbons decreased with increasing viscosity of
the hydrocarbons.53 It can be seen from
our test that S50 is the profoaming agent for light 1 oil, whereas
it is the antifoaming agent for viscous 3 oil. Our experimental results
strongly support the conclusion of Mannheimer in this regard. On the
other hand, the solubilization of PDMS oils in hydrocarbons seems
to reduce with increasing viscosity of the polymers.52 Good antifoam effectiveness with viscous PDMS is attributable
to the inverse correlation between PDMS solubility in the crude oil
and PDMS viscosity according to Pape.51 Using PDMS antifoams in aqueous media, however, does not involve
the complication because the solubility is so low that it is not a
problem, where the rate at which the sizes of the antifoam drops decrease
to suboptimal dimensions reduces if the antifoam viscosity increases,
so that effective antifoam action stands for long periods.

Moreover,
the temperature is another crucial point. Shearer demonstrated
that the solubility of PDMS in a hydrocarbon lube oil had a positive
correlation with temperature, so its antifoaming effect lessened progressively
and ultimately became profoaming.48 Similar
behavior is expected when mixing crude oil with PDMS. These observations
and explanations combined to show the real advantage of the use of
the most viscous PDMS as antifoams.

Callaghan attributed his
observations to the miscibility of PDMS
with such alkanes.52 Furthermore, the effect
of PDMS became profoaming as the antifoam was solubilized by the addition
of sufficient short-chain alkanes to the dead crude oil. He clarified
that solubilization of PDMS oils in hydrocarbons reduced and the antifoam
effects persisted at higher concentrations of added short-chain alkanes
by increasing the viscosity of the antifoam polymer. The observations
of Callaghan served to suggest that the variation of oil compositions
can substantially impact antifoam effectiveness of PDMS oils.52 Thus, it is possible to decrease the antifoam
solubility and improve the antifoam effectiveness by degassing a crude
oil (lower hydrocarbon components are removed). In contrast, effective
antifoams in dead crude oils may be rendered ineffective in live crude
oils. He gave a concrete example of this problem where a PDMS oil
was effective in the degassed crude oil but ineffective in the live
crude oil, presumably because of its lower solubility in the dead
oil.52

It is notable that the classical
coefficients cannot predict the
profoaming behavior of the low-viscosity PDMS oils because the antifoam/oil
and the antifoam/gas interfacial tensions are approximately the same.
The disagreement between the calculations of these coefficients and
the real antifoam behavior has been reported for aqueous media and
illustrated with the effect of the entry barrier.18 Unfortunately, presently neither a systematic experimental
observation of the wetting behavior of the antifoam drops on crude
oils nor a full picture of the dispersion state of PDMS oils in crude
oils is available. The available comprehensive analysis on the foaming
of oils with direct methods, such as the surface rheological and thin-film
methods, was done by Callaghan almost 40 years ago.44 It is, therefore, necessary to revisit the methods to study
this problematic issue with current understanding. Moreover, whether
the observations based on the behavior of antifoams in other nonaqueous
media can be extrapolated to crude oils is another complication. Thus,
it is difficult to assert here the mechanisms in the case of crude
oils because the direct optical observations at the lamellae or plateau
borders are not accessible.

2.3 Effect of Silica Nanoparticles
Figure 7 shows the
stabilization
of 1 and 5 oil foams by 0.01 wt % hydrophobic silica nanoparticle
P4. The time-lapse images in Figure 7a,7b were taken 10 min and 1
h, respectively, from the onset of the tests when constant foam height
was reached, indicating that the dispersion was in equilibrium and
the equilibrium rates are not the same for different nonaqueous systems.
The persistence of the liquid film up in the cylinder in Figure 7b is good evidence
of the increased rigidity of the interface.

Figure 7 Stabilization of the
1 oil foams (a) and 5 oil foams (b) by the
addition of 0.01 wt % hydrophobic silica nanoparticle P4.

The excellent ability of nanoparticles to enhance
foamability and
increase foam stability is particularly highlighted because of the
high surface area. We found that it took about 1 h for the nanoparticles/oil
sample 5 foaming system to reach a constant foam volume because the
absorption of the nanoparticles to the oil/air interface was a relatively
slow process. Sufficient time must be allowed for the rearrangement
and packing of the particles at the oil/air interface.33 We tried to test the foam/particle systems by
gradually reducing the concentration of the particles so that the
concentration of the nanoparticles was below the limit defined by
the height of the foam column. Foam characterizations of 0.07 wt %
nanoparticles/oil system were performed to determine the effect of
hydrophobicity of silica nanoparticles on the foamability and foam
stability. The profoamability effect (PE) and stabilization effect
(SE) of nanoparticles of different hydrophobicities are given in Figure 8. The PE and SE in Figure 8 were calculated
half an hour from the onset of the test before a constant foam volume
was reached for convenience. The effect of nanoparticle P1 is entirely
different from the effect of P2–P4. Nanoparticle P1 does not
contribute to the foamability or half-decay time, whereas P2–P4
show remarkable level of ability to increase the foamability and the
half-decay time. As the hydrophobicity of silica nanoparticles increases,
the PE and SE increase progressively. A positive correlation can be
established between PE and SE because they shift from negative to
positive concurrently. The difference among results of nanoparticles
of different hydrophobicities demonstrates that if the hydrophobicity
of the nanoparticles is less than a critical value, the nanoparticles
will not stably absorb to the oil/air interface. Among the nanoparticles
we prepared, P4 increases the foamability and the half-decay time
to a greater extent than other particles. It is anticipated that the
energy barrier to absorption of particles to the oil/air interface
is reduced progressively as hydrophobicity increases. If absorbed,
the nanoparticles form a close-packing layer stabilizing air bubbles
against Ostwald ripening. The close-packing layer increases the rigidity
of the interface, thus inhibiting film rupture and bubble coalescence.

Figure 8 Dependence
of the foamability effect and stabilization effect on
the hydrophobicity of silica nanoparticles.

The effect of nanoparticles as a function of concentration
is shown
in Figure 9. The PE
and SE of nanoparticles P4 at different concentrations were calculated
an hour from the onset of the test when the constant foam volume was
reached. PE and SE have positive correlations with nanoparticle concentration
between 0.002 and 0.03 wt %. Hydrophobic silica nanoparticle with
certain surfactants in oil can be useful stabilizers of the nonaqueous
foam with increased foamability and foam stability (133 and 218%)
at a low concentration (0.002 wt %). It is proposed that the increased
foamability and foam stability arise from a bridging monolayer/bilayer
of close-packing particles or a network of particle aggregates.54 A higher nanoparticle concentration allows more
bubbles to be covered with particle layers or networks. Furthermore,
bubbles coated with more particles show an increased stability against
disproportionation and coalescence. Thus, the foamability and foam
stability have a positive correlation with nanoparticle concentration.

Figure 9 Dependence
of the foamability effect and stabilization effect on
nanoparticle concentration.

We have only carried out the pneumatic test with air. The
test
results with air show an interesting aspect of the stabilization effect
of the hydrophobic silica nanoparticles, which corresponds with the
idea brought out by previous studies that colloidal particles can
be foaming agents of oils. The findings clearly illustrate that inorganic
solid particles, which accompany the production of crude oil, can
be foaming agents apart from asphaltene, resin, and acidic components.
The conclusions are probably less satisfying without the depressurization
test because the depressurization tests have their limitations. Therefore,
there is abundant room for further progress in this area. Also, the
selection of foaming surfactants for nonaqueous systems is usually
small compared to aqueous systems. In a broad sense, solid particles
can be used as foaming agents for nonaqueous systems when necessary.

3 Conclusions
We have studied the performance
of silicone oils as crude oil antifoams.
Antifoam efficacy is strongly affected by PDMS viscosity. The effect
of silicone oil transitions from stabilization to destabilization
when the PDMS viscosity surpasses critical viscosity. Antifoam effectiveness
is almost directly proportional to concentration. The classical theory
cannot predict the profoaming behavior of the low-viscosity PDMS oils.9 This observation coincides with some early descriptions,
presumably because of the differences in solubility.48,53 Good antifoam effectiveness with viscous PDMS is attributable to
the inverse correlation between PDMS solubility and PDMS or crude
oil viscosity.

Nanoparticle hydrophobicity and concentration
are the main factors
for foam stabilization. Sufficient time must be allowed for the rearrangement
and packing of particles at the oil/air interface. It is anticipated
that the energy barrier to absorption of particles to the oil/air
interface is reduced progressively as hydrophobicity increases, so
nanoparticles will not firmly absorb to the oil/air interface when
hydrophobicity is under the critical value. The strength of the bridging
layers or the networks is greater when nanoparticle concentration
is higher, thus stabilizing foam to a greater extent. In food, cosmetics,
and petrochemical industries, the illustration and application of
particle-stabilized nonaqueous foams are rapidly developing, but other
factors, such as the size or type of particles, still await further
elucidation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fluid Selection
Two crude oils and
two mineral oils were chosen as foaming systems. A third crude oil
was created by mixing the two crude oils in a 1:1 ratio. When we mixed
the two crude oils, no signs of incompatibility appeared. Oil sample
1 was a light crude oil from Murban region. Sample 3 was a slightly
heavy crude oil from Changqing, China. We used paraffinic mineral
oils 4 and 5 in some tests because they had good foamability without
adding chemicals. Oil sample 5 (913 kg/m3) is heavier than
oil sample 4 (851 kg/m3) and has lower foamability. Oil
samples 1, 4, and 5 were good natural foaming liquids, whereas 2 and
3 oils were not; so, 3 vol % sodium abietate (oil-soluble anionic
amphiphile) was added into oil samples 2 and 3 to increase their foamability.
The surfactant had little impact on oil viscosity. After the preparation,
the oils were preserved in a hermetic vessel so that the physicochemical
properties of the oils stayed virtually the same.

Viscosity
was characterized with the Anton Paar rheometer at 20 °C. The
surface tension was measured with the KRÜSS force tensiometer
K100 by which ten measurements were automatically performed to obtain
the results. The viscosity was characterized by the Anton Parr rheometer
MCR302 (concentric cylinder measuring system). The SARA composition
for crude oils 1–3 is tested with the NB/SH/T 0509-2010 method
(n-heptane for asphaltene precipitation).

4.2 Preparation and Characterization of Silica
Nanoparticles
Silica nanoparticles of different hydrophobic
grades were prepared by treating hydrophilic silica nanoparticles
(99.8% pure, primary diameter 7–40 nm, surface area 200 m2/g, supplier Aladdin) with different amounts of silylating
reagent. The silylating reagent used was dichlorodimethylsilane (96.0%
pure, Aladdin). First, hydrophilic silica nanoparticles were heated
at 120 °C for 50 min. Silica particles/ethanol system, 4.8 wt
%, was gently agitated in a round-bottom flask. Deionized water (5
wt % to silica nanoparticles) and different amounts of dichlorodimethylsilane
(5, 7.5, 10, and 20 wt % to silica nanoparticles) were added into
the flask, which was heated under reflux (120 °C, 50 min) to
increase the rate of silanization. The suspension was then washed
with ethanol twice. Silica nanoparticles produced with this method
were named P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the ascending order of hydrophobicity.

The contact angles of water on analogous silica plate systems for
P1–P4 were measured by optical contact angle goniometer. The
surface morphologies of the silica nanoparticles were observed by
scanning electron microscope (ZEISS Sigma 500). The sample was stuck
onto the conductive adhesive, and a layer of gold was sprayed on the
samples under vacuum for SEM scanning.

4.3 Foam
Test
The most representative
and suitable test for studying crude oil foams is the depressurization
test because depressurization or decompression is closely related
to how crude oil foams are mainly produced.7,55 However,
there are some problems with this technique because some oils do not
produce any depressurization foam.56 In
our case, oils 1, 2, 3 do not produce foam using the depressurization
test.7 Sufficient time was allowed for
saturation. Still, the amount of depressurization foam was ignorable.
We have tested the new mixture with surfactant sodium abietate in
the depressurization test but still cannot produce an appreciable
volume of foam. Additionally, the cleaning procedure is a serious
issue because it is difficult to remove the remaining viscous oil
from the tubes and the ball valves. Furthermore, we observed the incompatibility
of different oils provided that oils were not thoroughly cleaned in
the depressurization test. For these reasons, we have not tried to
perform the depressurization test. We are aware of the difference
between the depressurization test and the pneumatic test, but we can
only perform the pneumatic test on the crude oils. In further research,
it might be possible to construct the pressurized apparatus with components
that are easily disassembled and cleaned to investigate the antifoam
performance based on the depressurization method.

The micro
air pump generated a continuous air flow, which was then regulated
and measured by a rotameter (range 30–300 mL/min). The fine
sintered glass sparger (mean pore size 50 μm) was fitted at
the bottom of the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cylinder (inner
diameter 18 mm, height 200 mm). The gas flow rate was maintained at
150 mL/min until a constant foam height was reached. A column of static
foam was left to collapse to half of its constant foam volume after
a time. A high-resolution camera was used to capture the evolution
of foam height against time. Special attention was paid to the reliability
of the experimental method by rigorously averaging the results from
three consecutive runs. Several measures are taken to keep experimental
errors to a minimum. The glassware and PMMA cylinder were cleaned
with petroleum ether and then deionized water.

Foaminess ∑,
Foamability Π, and half-decay time t were used
to characterize foam evolution. Foaminess is
defined as the ratio of the constant foam volume to the air flow rate.
Foamability is defined as the ratio of the constant foam volume to
the initial liquid volume.43 When foam
reached a constant volume, the air flow was cut off. Half-decay time
is defined as the time when foam height (measured from air/foam interface
to foam/bulk liquid interface) collapses to half of the constant foam
height.

Throughout the tests, the air flux rate was kept at
150 mL/min.
The room temperature was kept at 20 °C. Oil samples 1–4
were used as foaming systems for the test of antifoam performance
versus PDMS viscosity. At first, oil sample 4 was tested to find the
preliminary results. Then, the other oils were tested to find what
they had in common. Oils that are 5 cm in height were placed in the
graduated open PMMA cylinder for tests. Then, air was injected into
the cylinder via the sparger from the bottom. For the test of antifoam
performance versus PDMS concentration, air was injected into the cylinder
containing oil sample 2 with different proportions of S150.

For the test of the nanoparticles/oil system, oil sample 5 was
used as the foaming liquid because chemical-free oil sample 5 had
the least foamability, which ensures that a constant foam height in
the presence of silica nanoparticles will not exceed the height of
the graduated cylinder. Air was injected into the cylinder containing
oil sample 5 of height 4 cm with nanoparticles P1–P4. For the
test of nanoparticle concentration, air was injected into the cylinder
containing oil sample 5 of height 4 cm with different proportions
of nanoparticle P4.

4.4 Characterization of the
Effect of PDMS Oils
and Silica Nanoparticles
We have defined four parameters
to characterize the effect of PDMS oils and silica nanoparticles on
foamability (foam at maximum volume) and half-decay time (foam stability).
The capacity of PDMS oil to prevent foam formation and undermine foam
stability is its antifoamability and destabilization effect (AE and
DE). The ability of nanoparticle to promote foam formation and enhance
foam stability is its profoamability and stabilization effect (PE
and SE).

We have related AE and DE to the foamability (the maximum
quantity of foam that can be created under test conditions) and half-decay
time (the time for the foam to collapse to half of its volume). These
new indexes AE and DE of PDMS oils were expressed as percentages and
characterized by calculating the percentage decrease of foamability
and half-decay time (shown in eqs 4 and 5) compared to the cases
without the additive.9 Thus, antifoams
can be readily classified according to their index values. Positive
values of AE and DE indicate that PDMS oils have an antifoaming effect,
whereas nonpositive values of AE and DE suggest that PDMS oils have
no antifoaming effect. Theoretically, foamability Π and half-decay
time t can be reduced to zero by antifoams. Thus,
AE and DE can reach 100% to the maximum. It is worth noting that some
researchers have observed that additives may affect different stages
of foam life. Thus the half-decay time alone may not be sufficient
for characterization of the effectiveness of antifoams. However, we
have not observed that additives affect different stages of foam life
within the scope of this test. Additionally, some have argued the
antifoaming effect should be distinguished from the defoaming effect
because a defoamer is used when the foam is produced already and an antifoam is added before the foam tests. 4   5  Similarly, the PE and SE of silica nanoparticle
were determined by calculating the percentage increase of foamability
and half-decay time (shown in eqs 6 and 7). Positive values of PE
and SE show that the silica nanoparticle has a profoaming effect,
whereas nonpositive values of PE and SE show that the silica nanoparticle
has no profoaming effect. 6   7
