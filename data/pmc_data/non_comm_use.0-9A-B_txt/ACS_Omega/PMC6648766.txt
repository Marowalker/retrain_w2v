A deep-blue thermally
activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter
TXADO-spiro-DMACF has been reported for nondoped organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) by integrating an appropriate blocking unit with the
donor (D)–acceptor (A)–donor (D)-type TADF emitter via
a spiro linkage. Benefiting from the characteristic perpendicular
arrangement, the intermolecular interactions are expected to be weakened
to some degree. As a result, TXADO-spiro-DMACF shows a very small
bathochromic shift of 8 nm associated with a narrowed full width at
half maximum of 54 nm on going from solution to the film. The corresponding
nondoped device successfully achieves a bright deep-blue emission,
revealing Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage coordinates
of (0.16, 0.09) and a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3% (5.3
cd/A, 5.9 lm/W). The results clearly indicate that spiro-blocking
is a promising strategy to develop deep-blue TADF emitters capable
of nondoped OLEDs.

1 Introduction
Pure
organic molecules showing thermally activated delayed fluorescence
(TADF) have emerged as the third generation electroluminescence (EL)
materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) nowadays.1−3 Different from the conventional fluorescent emitters with a limited
25% internal quantum efficiency (IQE),4,5 TADF molecules
can further utilize 75% of electrically generated triplet excitons
and thus realize a nearly unity IQE through efficient up-conversion
from the lowest triplet state (T1) to the lowest singlet
state (S1).6,7 Meanwhile, they do not contain
any noble metals but can achieve parallel device performance to phosphorescent
complexes8,9 in a much more different and cheaper way.10−12 Promoted by these features, numerous TADF emitters that reveal different
emission colors in the whole visible region have already been designed
and used successfully to fabricate TADF-based OLEDs.13−15

Among them, deep-blue TADF emitters are of great importance,
whose
Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of y (CIEy) ≤ 0.10 is required
to increase the color gamut and reduce power consumption in display
applications.16,17 Furthermore, they are also indispensable
for the construction of blue hyperfluorescence systems, where they
act as a host matrix or an assistant dopant for the conventional fluorescent
emitters so as to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons.18,19 Early in 2012, Adachi et al. observed the first deep-blue TADF from
a carbazole/sulfone derivative and obtained a maximum external quantum
efficiency (EQE) of 9.9% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.07).20 After that, much effort has been paid to the
design of efficient deep-blue TADF emitters,21−24 and the EQE is improved to 19.2%
together with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.10).22 We note that all the currently reported progresses are
made based on a doped device configuration. In this case, the host
investigation and selection is still an ongoing activity especially
for deep-blue TADF emitters because the requirement of a wide band
gap as well as high triplet energy inevitably leads to unfavored carrier
injection and transporting. As an alternative, nondoped OLEDs (also
denoted as host-free OLEDs) are able to solve the problem, in which
the emitting layer is composed of an emitter independently without
any additional host.25−28 However, the realization of deep-blue TADF in nondoped OLEDs remains
a big challenge because most of deep-blue TADF emitters often suffer
from a considerable spectral red-shifting,29,30 and aggregation caused quenching31,32 in their neat
films.

On the other hand, a spiro geometry is beneficial to
reduce the
intermolecular interactions and thus suppress the spectral red-shifting
and aggregation-caused quenching.33,34 However, none
of the spiro-based TADF molecules are reported to be suitable for
nondoped devices with deep-blue emissions now.35−39 Herein, we newly propose a spiro-blocking strategy
toward deep-blue TADF emitters capable of nondoped OLEDs. As depicted
in Figure 1, an appropriate
blocking unit is integrated with the linear donor (D)–acceptor
(A)–donor (D) type TADF emitter via a spiro linkage. Benefiting
from the characteristic perpendicular arrangement, the intermolecular
interactions would be weakened to some degree, and the realization
of deep-blue TADF in nondoped OLEDs is within our expectations. As
a proof of concept, a model compound TXADO-spiro-DMACF has been demonstrated,
whose nondoped device gives a deep-blue EL with CIE coordinates of
(0.16, 0.09) as well as a promising EQE of 5.3% (5.3 cd/A, 5.9 lm/W).

nondoped OLEDs.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Molecular Design
As for TXADO-spiro-DMACF
(Figure 2), 9,9-dimethylacridine
and fluorene are used as the donor and acceptor, respectively, to
constitute a linear D–A–D emitter (DMACF), and thioxanthene
dioxide (TXADO) is chosen as the blocking unit, whose highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
energy levels play a key role on the formation of the spiro-blocking.
In other words, the HOMO of TXADO should be lower than that of DMACF
(Table S1) to ensure the HOMO distribution
mainly on 9,9-dimethylacridine. At the same time, the LUMO of TXADO
is higher than that of DMACF so that the LUMO distribution could be
effectively limited on fluorene rather than TXADO. Combined with the
large torsion angle between TXADO and DMACF (81.9°), the observations
clearly indicate that the spiro-linked TXADO does not contribute to
the charge transfer (CT) nature of the whole molecule, but acts as
the blocking unit to prevent the intermolecular interactions. On the
other hand, after the introduction of TXADO, the LUMO is greatly down
from −1.30 eV of DMACF to −1.56 eV of TXADO-spiro-DMACF,
while their HOMO levels remain nearly unchanged (Table S1). Thereby, S1 of TXADO-spiro-DMACF, estimated
by the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) based on
its optimized ground state geometry, is correspondingly reduced to
2.9937 eV compared with DMACF (3.2440 eV, Table S2). Given the small variation of T1 (here 3LE is the lowest triplet state) between DMACF and TXADO-spiro-DMACF,
the energy difference between S1 and T1 (ΔEST) of TXADO-spiro-DMACF is predicted to be
0.1730 eV in the toluene solution, much lower than that of DMACF (0.3876
eV). In brief, the introduced TXADO can not only function as a blocking
group but also lead to the decreased ΔEST to favor the efficient up-conversion from T1 to
S1 by absorbing environmental thermal energy. This implies
that TXADO-spiro-DMACF other than DMACF may be a good TADF emitter
suitable for the nondoped device.

2.2 Synthesis
and Characterization
The
synthetic route for TXADO-spiro-DMACF is presented in Scheme 1. Starting from 4,4′-dibromo-1,1′-biphenyl,
the key intermediate 2,7-dibromospiro[fluorene-9,9′-thioxanthene]-10′,10′-dioxide
(5) was firstly prepared through nitration, reduction,
iodination, Kumada reaction, and cyclization.4 Then, a C–N coupling between 5 and 9,9-dimethylacridine
was performed to afford TXADO-spiro-DMACF with a yield of 96%. The
final compound was fully confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analysis (Figure S1). The decomposition temperature (Td, corresponding to a 5% weight loss) of TXADO-spiro-DMACF
is determined to be above 460 °C, and no obvious glass transition
is detected in the range of 35–300 °C (Figure S2). The rigid geometry of TXADO-spiro-DMACF should
be responsible for the observed excellent thermal stability, which
makes it favorable for vacuum deposition and long-term OLEDs. Moreover,
according to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and optical bandgap, the
HOMO and LUMO levels are determined to be −5.33 and −2.23
eV, respectively (Figure S3 and Table 1).

2.3 Photophysical Properties
The steady-state
UV–vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in toluene
solutions for TXADO-spiro-DMACF, compared with its film PL spectrum,
are shown in Figure 3a. Besides the intense absorption band below 330 nm, there is another
weak but the discernible band in the range of 330–400 nm. As
discussed above, this absorption could be reasonably attributed to
the CT band from 9,9-dimethylacridine to fluorene. Also, a strong
PL peaked at about 437 nm is observed for TXADO-spiro-DMACF in toluene,
corresponding to an S1 of 3.14 eV. On going from solution
to the film, the emission moves from 437 nm to a longer wavelength
of 445 nm, and the full width at half maximum (fwhm) is slightly down
from 62 to 54 nm. The very small red-shift (8 nm) as well as reduced
fwhm of TXADO-spiro-DMACF implies that the intermolecular interactions
are substantially inhibited in solid states because of spiro-blocking.
This is further verified by the PL quantum yield (PLQY = 0.42) of
TXADO-spiro-DMACF in the nondoped film, which is close to that of
the 10 wt % doped film into the host tris(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)amine
(TCTA). Also, these results are in well agreement with the crystal
packing in TXADO-spiro-DMACF (Figure S4), where TXADO is found to act as an efficient blocking unit between
acceptor and acceptor, donor and donor, and acceptor and donor.

Figure 3 Photophysical
properties of TXADO-spiro-DMACF: (a) UV–vis
absorption and PL spectra in toluene solution (black) compared with
the film PL spectrum (blue) and (b) temperature-dependent transient
PL in the neat film under a nitrogen atmosphere (inset: prompt component).

The phosphorescence spectrum of
TXADO-spiro-DMACF was measured
at 77 K (Figure S5). In well agreement
with theoretical computation, the T1 and ΔEST are estimated to be 2.86 and 0.28 eV, respectively.
Also, we try to record the photo-excited transient decay spectra for
the TXADO-spiro-DMACF film. As one can see (Figures 3b and S6), a prompt
fluorescence lifetime (τp) of 3.8 ns is observed
in the nanosecond scale. To investigate the potential delayed fluorescence,
we then extend the detection time to the millisecond scale under a
nitrogen atmosphere. At room temperature, TXADO-spiro-DMACF exhibits
a distinct delay component with a delayed fluorescence lifetime (τd) of 106 us, which disappears in the presence of oxygen (Figure S7). As the temperature is down from 300
to 150 K, noticeably, the proportion of the delayed component is found
to be gradually decreased, which is a typical feature of TADF emitters.6,7,10−15

2.4 EL Performance
To evaluate the EL
property of TXADO-spiro-DMACF, a nondoped device was fabricated with
a configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoO3 (10 nm)/TAPC
(60 nm)/TCTA (5 nm)/TXADO-spiro-DMACF (20 nm)/BmPyPB (30 nm)/LiF (1
nm)/Al (Figure 4).
Here, MoO3 and LiF are employed as the hole- and electron-injecting
materials, respectively; TAPC (4,4′-(cyclohexane-1,1-diyl)bis(N,N-di-p-tolylaniline))
and BmPyPB (3,3″,5,5″-tetra(pyridin-3-yl)-1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl)
act as the hole- and electron-transporting materials, respectively;
TCTA is selected as the buffer layer and exciton-blocking layer and
TXADO-spiro-DMACF is used independently as the emitting layer.

Figure 4 (a) Nondoped
device configuration; (b) molecular structures of
used materials.

The EL spectrum, current
density–voltage–luminance
characteristics, and the luminance dependence of the current efficiency
and EQE are plotted in Figure 5. TXADO-spiro-DMACF displays a bright deep-blue EL with a
peak at 444 nm, which is almost independent on the driving voltages,
and a long tail between 500 and 600 nm is also observed in the EL
spectra, which could be tentatively attributed to the electromer emission.40 Despite this, the CIE coordinates are (0.16,
0.09), close to the National Television System Committee standard
viz. (0.14, 0.08). To our knowledge, this is the first realization
of deep-blue (CIEy ≤ 0.10) TADF
OLEDs on the basis of a nondoped device configuration. In the meantime,
a comparable device performance is also attained, giving a maximum
luminance of 3120 cd/m2, a current efficiency of 5.3 cd/A,
and an EQE of 5.3% (Table 2). At a luminance of 200 cd/m2, the EQE further
decays to 3.0% (Figure S8). The observed
efficiency roll-off could be ascribed to the triplet–triplet
annihilation induced by the long delayed lifetime of 106 μs.
More interestingly, the deep-blue device can work at an extremely
low driving voltage, leading to power efficiency as high as 5.9 lm/W
(Figure S9). For instance, the turn-on
voltage at 1 cd/m2 is about 2.8 V, even lower than that
of the optical band gap of TXADO-spiro-DMACF (3.10 eV). The results
suggest the good charge injection and transporting capability and
show the great potential of TXADO-spiro-DMACF used for nondoped devices.
On the basis of 10 wt % TXADO-spiro-DMACF doped into TCTA as the emitting
layer instead of the neat TXADO-spiro-DMACF, we note, the emissive
maximum is further blue-shifted from 444 to 428 nm for the doped device
together with a peak EQE of 4.3% and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.05)
(Figure S10 and Table S3).

3 Conclusions
In summary, a spiro-blocking strategy has been
newly demonstrated
to realize deep-blue and TADF-based nondoped devices. With TXADO-spiro-DMACF
as an example, a gentle bathochromic shift associated with a narrowed
PL profile, a moderate PLQY and an obvious TADF characteristic are
achieved in solid states because of the reduced intermolecular interactions
induced by the spiro-blocking. As a result, the TXADO-spiro-DMACF-based
nondoped device reveals a deep-blue emission simultaneously with good
color purity and high efficiency. This work, we think, will shed light
on the development of deep-blue TADF emitters suitable for nondoped
OLEDs and subsequently the construction of efficient deep-blue or
blue hyperfluorescence systems.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Measurements and Characterizations
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with
a Bruker AVANCE NMR spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed
using a Bio-Rad elemental analysis system. MALDI-TOF mass spectra
were performed on an AXIMA CFR MS apparatus (COMPACT). Thermal gravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed
with a PerkinElmer-TGA 7 and PerkinElmer-DSC 7 instrument, respectively,
under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. UV–vis
absorption and PL spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LAMBDA 35
UV–vis spectrometer and PerkinElmer LS 50B spectrofluorometer,
respectively. The PLQYs were measured using a quantum yield measurement
system (C10027, Hamamatsu Photonics) excited at 360 nm. The transient
PL spectra were measured by a HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer.
Also, the prompt and delay lifetimes were estimated according to a
monoexponential and tri-exponential fittings, respectively. CV curves
were recorded on an EG&G 283 Princeton Applied Research potentiostat/galvanostat
system. Ferrocene was used as the reference and n-Bu4NClO4 was used as the supporting electrolyte.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the equation
HOMO = −e[Eonset,ox + 4.8] V, LUMO = HOMO + Eg, where Eonset,ox was the onset value of the first oxidation
potential, and Eg was the optical band
gap estimated from the absorption onset.

4.2 Device
Fabrication and Testing
All
the devices were fabricated on glass substrates precoated with 180
nm ITO with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω/sq. The ITO substrates
were degreased in ultrasonic solvent bath and then dried at 120 °C
for 30 min. Before loaded into the vacuum deposition chamber, the
ITO surface was treated with UV–ozone for 15 min. Then, 10
nm of MoO3 was firstly deposited on the top of ITO substrates,
followed by 60 nm TAPC, 5 nm TCTA, 20 nm emitting layer, and 35 nm
BmPyPB. Finally, 1 nm of LiF and 120 nm of Al were sequentially deposited
to form the cathode. All the layers were grown by thermal evaporation
in a high-vacuum system with a pressure less than 5 × 10–4 Pa without breaking vacuum. The organic materials
were evaporated at the rate in a range of 1–2 Å/s, and
the metal Al was evaporated at the rate of 8–10 Å/s. The
overlap between ITO and Al electrodes was 4 mm × 4 mm, which
is the active emissive area of the OLED devices. The current–voltage–brightness
characteristics were measured by using a set of Keithley source measurement
units (Keithley 2400 and Keithley 2000) with a calibrated silicon
photodiode. The EL spectra and CIE coordinates were recorded with
a PR650 spectra colorimeter. All the measurements were carried out
in an ambient atmosphere at room temperature.

4.3 Materials
All starting materials
for the synthesis were purchased from commercial sources and used
as received unless otherwise noted. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) used for
the Grignard reaction and toluene used for the Buchwald–Hartwig
reaction were dried by sodium and distilled under an argon atmosphere.

fuming nitric acid was added dropwise. After being stirred for ∼2
h, the solution was cooled to room temperature, poured into ∼2
L of water with a stirring bar. The resulting solid was collected
by filtration, dried in vacuum at 70 °C overnight. The crude
product was purified by column chromatography to give some bright

of 3 (8.76 g, 20 mmol) and 1 drop of bromoethane (as
the initiator) in ∼50 mL of dry THF was added dropwise into
the system. After being stirring for 30 min at 60 °C, the solution
was transfer into a flask with 9H-thioxanthen-9-one
10,10-dioxide (7.33 g, 30 mmol) through a needle tube connecting the
two spaces, stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. The mixture was cooled
to room temperature before ∼200 mL of water was added, extracted
with 200 mL of dichloromethane twice. The combined organic solution
was dried with Na2SO4, filtrated, and removed
the solvent in vacuum. The residue was further purified by column
chromatography to give some white solid 4 (9.11 g, 50%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO): δ 8.15 (s, 1H), 7.80 (dd, J = 11.2, 5.0 Hz, 2H), 7.62–7.54 (m, 5H), 7.30 (s,

of 4 (8 g, 14.11 mmol) and ∼400 mL of acetic acid
was heated to 100 °C (colorless transparent solution). ∼50
mL of hydrochloric acid (6 mol/L) was added slowly. After being stirring
overnight, the system was cooled to room temperature resulting in
some slightly yellow precipitation. The solid was collected by filtration
and washed with water three times, and dried in vacuum at 70 °C
overnight. The crude product was further purified by column chromatography
to give some white solid 5 (4.77 g, 62%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.26 (dd, J = 8.0, 0.9 Hz, 2H), 7.68 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 2H), 7.59–7.49
(m, 4H), 7.46 (d, J = 1.5 Hz, 2H), 7.35–7.29
(m, 2H), 6.56 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H).

The reaction was
conducted under an argon atmosphere. A mixture of 5 (1.20
g, 2.20 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (1.10
g, 5.30 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (0.050 g, 0.053 mmol),
P(t-Bu)3HBF4 (0.064 g, 0.22
mmol), and t-BuONa (2.10 g, 22 mmol) was added before
∼50 mL trimethylbenzene and heated to 135 °C overnight.
The system was cooled to room temperature and most of the solvent
was removed by reduced pressure distillation. The residue was further
purified by column chromatography to give some white solid 6 (1.76 g, 96%). Then, the product was recrystallized in a mixed solvent
of dichloromethane and n-hexane twice. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.18–8.13 (m, 4H),
7.50–7.43 (m, 4H), 7.42–7.33 (m, 8H), 6.92–6.83
(m, 10H), 6.19–6.11 (m, 4H), 1.61 (s, 12H). 13C
