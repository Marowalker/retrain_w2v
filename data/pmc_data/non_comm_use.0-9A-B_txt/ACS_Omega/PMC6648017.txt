The charge distribution of NO2 groups within the crystalline
polymorphs of energetic materials strongly affects their explosive
properties. We use the recently introduced basis-space iterated stockholder
atom partitioning of high-quality charge distributions to examine
the approximations that can be made in modeling polymorphs and their
physical properties, using 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine,
trinitrotoluene, 1-3-5-trinitrobenzene, and hexanitrobenzene as exemplars.
The NO2 charge distribution is strongly affected by the
neighboring atoms, the rest of the molecules, and also significantly
by the NO2 torsion angle within the possible variations
found in observed crystal structures. Thus, the proposed correlations
between the molecular electrostatic properties, such as trigger-bond
potential or maxima in the electrostatic potential, and impact sensitivity
will be affected by the changes in conformation that occur on crystallization.
We establish the relationship between the NO2 torsion angle
and the likelihood of occurrence in observed crystal structures, the
conformational energy, and the charge and dipole magnitude on each
atom, and how this varies with the neighboring groups. We examine
the effect of analytically rotating the atomic multipole moments to
model changes in torsion angle and establish that this is a viable
approach for crystal structures but is not accurate enough to model
the relative lattice energies. This establishes the basis of transferability
of the NO2 charge distribution for realistic nonempirical
model intermolecular potentials for simulating energetic materials.

Introduction
Energetic materials,
which decompose explosively under various
external stimuli, are intrinsically difficult to study experimentally,
and hence, the design of new materials with desirable property combinations
such as low sensitivity but high detonation performance can benefit
from accurate molecular modeling.1−3 The explosive properties
are sensitive to the arrangement of molecules in the crystal and hence
to the polymorph formed.1,4−6 Consequently, crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods may be
used to determine whether an energetic molecule can crystallize in
a dense structure with good energetic properties, helping to focus
synthetic efforts. There have been extensive quantum mechanical studies7 seeking to find correlations with the experimental
impact sensitivity of the materials,1,3,8−18 but these are on the intrinsic sensitivity or stability of the isolated
molecule as opposed to the measured sensitivity of the condensed phase.7 It has been recognized that the crystal structure
will also affect energetic properties, as the intermolecular interactions
in the solid are linked to dissociation processes essential to detonation,
such as defect formation. Correlations have been found between the
heat of fusion of the crystal and the N–N bond dissociation
energy19 or crystalline void space,20 but the prediction of impact sensitivity and
other processes is clearly a complex combination of molecular and
crystalline properties.21−23 In particular, the crystalline
conformation can differ from the isolated molecule conformation and
vary between polymorphs and with temperature and pressure. We examine
how changes in NO2 torsion angles that can occur on crystallization
can affect the molecular charge distribution and associated electrostatic
properties. This is a preliminary and necessary step toward the goal
of developing methods of predicting impact sensitivity and other explosive
properties, using CSP-generated crystal structures.

Computing
energetic material properties requires accurately modeling
regions of the repulsive wall. These regions of the potential energy
surface are not adequately sampled by empirical intermolecular potentials
as they have been fitted to crystals at ambient conditions. Thus,
developing nonempirical methods for modeling the intermolecular forces
between energetic molecules, suitable for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, has been the subject of a considerable body of recent
research.24−26 However, such methodologies have usually treated
the molecules as rigid. A distributed multipole model of the molecular
charge distribution provides both a method of examining the transferability
of the local charge distribution and a model for calculating the electrostatic
contribution to the intermolecular energy. This study only examines
the conformation dependence of the electrostatic term. However, other
contributions to the intermolecular energy, such as the induction,
dispersion, and anisotropic short-range repulsive terms, are very
closely related to the molecular charge distribution and therefore
are expected to show similar transferability properties. The electrostatic
term tends to be the most dominant, orientation-dependent determinant
of intermolecular interactions between molecules in van der Waals
contact. It is arguably27 the dominant
contribution to the interactions, which are often described by crystal
engineers as hydrogen bonding, π···π stacking,
N···O interactions, etc. Presently, accurate nonempirical
models for intermolecular forces derived from the molecular charge
distribution have tended to focus on rigid molecules28 because of the difficulty of modeling the changes in charge
distribution with conformation.

This study of NO2 group charge distributions and the
modeling of energetic crystals is aided by the recently introduced
basis-space iterated stockholder atom (BS-ISA) analysis of the molecular
charge distributions.29,30 This partitioning of the molecular
charge distribution produces atomic electron densities that decay
from the atomic center almost exponentially. Additionally, the ISA
scheme produces maximally spherical and so transferable atomic charge
distributions, which are relatively insensitive to basis set yet fast
at converging, and allows the use of high-quality molecular wave functions.31 The high degree of sphericity of the ISA atoms
reduces the importance of higher atomic multipole moments enabling
the truncation of the multipole moment expansion at lower-order terms.

The atomic multipole moments of the nitro groups can be examined
for both transferability between molecules and conformations, and
used in models for impact sensitivity. This study is based on the
nitro explosives 1-3-5-trinitrobenzene (TNB), hexanitrobenzene (HNB),
trinitrotoluene (TNT), and 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)
whose structurally characterized polymorphs are shown in Figure 1. From the variation
in nitro torsion angles (and axial/equatorial conformation in RDX)
between polymorphs, it is clear that the crystalline structure has
a significant effect on the molecular conformation. This, in turn,
will affect the charge distribution by changing the orbital overlaps
in π and σ bonding.

structures, computed at the PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ level, are given in parentheses
in red or blue for positively or negatively charge nuclei, respectively.
The NO2 torsion angles for the optimized molecules are
given below the structural diagrams.

While there are currently a few reliable methods for predicting
the detonation pressures and velocities of CHNO energetics,1 there has been less progress made toward predicting
the sensitivity of an explosive compound to the different stimuli
that can initiate detonation.44 This reflects
the intricacies of initiation leading to detonation; for example,
the explosive molecule LLM-119 is sensitive to impact but moderately
insensitive to friction and electrical sparks.45 A widely studied and important measure of sensitivity is
impact sensitivity, which is the vulnerability of the material to
explosion after sudden compression due to impact.7 This is a complex process, dominated by the chemistry of
the chemical reaction that takes place,2 chemical bonding, and molecular interactions within the crystal.
The impact sensitivity of an energetic material is normally determined
using a drop-weight test,46 being inversely
proportional to h50%, the height at which
50% of the experiments produce a reaction on dropping a weight onto
the material. The impact sensitivity of material is heavily dependent
on the particle size,1 the shape and hardness
of the crystals, the roughness of its surfaces, the purity and the
presence of lattice defects, as well as the intrinsic differences
in polymorph packing,6,47−49 the surrounding
temperature during experiment, and the weight used. Hence, the observed
impact sensitivities (h50%) for TNT vary
from around 100 cm to over 250 cm.4,5 We use the
experimental impact sensitivities obtained in 1990 by Wilson and Bliss5 as they are a consistent set of experiments under
consistent conditions, for TNB, HNB, and TNT, though these do not
have separate values for the different polymorphs. RDX is a comparatively
new explosive and its impact sensitivities were measured later.44,50

Correlations between the molecular electrostatic potential
(a molecular
property) and the impact sensitivity (a crystal property) of CHNO
energetic materials were investigated decades ago,9−13 based on the crude electrostatic models9,14−18 available at the time. One approach focuses on the charge distribution
at the trigger bonds (the bond likely to break during initiation).46,51 The trigger bonds are typically X–NO2 functional
groups, and the strengths of C–NO2 and N–NO2 bonds are found to be inversely proportional to the magnitudes
of the positive electrostatic potentials in the C–N and N–N
internuclear regions (Vmid).15,16,52,53 A more impact sensitive (low h50%) conformer
would be one where the charge gradient in the X–NO2 bonds is the largest. The electrostatic potential at the longest
C–NO2 bond is often used,16,18,54 as calculated by the equation first proposed
by Owens in 198518 1  where R is the longest bond
length between C and N in the C–NO2 bonds, while QC and QN are the
atomic charges. The above equation is based on the assumption that
the longest X–NO2 bond will be the first bond to
break during the initiation process. The initial correlations between Vmid and impact sensitivity computed using the
Mulliken point charges55 with an HF/STO-3G
level of theory18 on each atom were only
observed within a specific group of poly-nitroaromatics, which at
least partly reflects the limitations of the partitioned charges in
early ab initio calculations. Alternatively, to incorporate the response
of the other trigger bonds in the molecule, the averaged Vmid 2  has been used4 to
derive empirical correlation models for reproducing impact sensitivities
of CHNO explosives. A more general but complex correlation has been
suggested between the electrostatic potential surface of the isolated
molecule and crystal impact sensitivities, with the sensitivity of
the explosive to impact being exponentially related to the average
positive and negative potentials across the molecular electrostatic
potential surface4 3  where an are best-fit parameters, and V̅S+ and V̅S– are
the average positive and negative electrostatic potentials on the
isosurface. This is an example of the more intricate correlations
that have been investigated. However, the goal of finding an adequate
predictive correlation of impact sensitivity with molecular properties
across all chemical families of explosives is still elusive. This
could well be because sensitivity to initiation causing detonation
is not limited to a molecular property but also the crystal environment.
Now that CSP could, in principle, be used in the design of new explosives,
the likely crystallization environment of a molecule prior to its
synthesis is no longer unknown. Given that the empirical correlations
of molecular properties with impact sensitivity have focused on electrostatic
properties yet ignored the conformational change on crystallization,
it is appropriate to ask whether these changes in NO2 torsion
angle would affect the impact sensitivity.

In this study, we
focus on the electrostatic potential surface
maximum (Vmax) and minimum (Vmin), as many studies have focused on the correlation
of impact sensitivity with these molecular properties.1,3,7,21,51−53,56−59 The electrostatic maxima and minima in molecules have been used
in a method of estimating the likelihood of cocrystal formation,60 i.e., as a simple and approximate surrogate
for likely relative crystal energies. Analysis of the electrostatic
potential of isolated TNT and CL-20 molecules and their hetero/homodimers3 was able to correlate their electrostatic potential
maxima (Vmax), minima (Vmin), and the range of the minima and maxima (Vtot), to justify cocrystal formation and observed
sensitivities to impact. Though not explicitly discussed in the paper,3 it showed that the change in conformation of
CL-20 and TNT from pure crystal to cocrystal changes the charge distribution
of the isolated molecules and thus the electrostatic potential, which
may help rationalize the reduced impact sensitivity of the cocrystal.

Thus, this paper uses state-of-the-art electrostatic models to
examine the role of conformational change on the charge distributions
of NO2 groups. We use iterated stockholder atom (ISA)29 partitioned distributed multipoles to determine
whether changes in torsion angle due to crystallization affect some
proposed correlations with impact sensitivity. We also investigate
whether this change is important to the molecular modeling of nitroenergetics,
specifically for crystal structure prediction (CSP) studies and the
development of nonempirical anisotropic atom–atom intermolecular
potentials.

Methods
The static isolated molecular structures of
RDX, TNT, TNB, and
HNB were optimized using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) general gradient approximation combined with a portion of exact
exchange to form the PBE0 functional61−63 and the aug-cc-pVTZ
Dunning basis64 using the Gaussian 09 program.65 This level of theory was also used for conformational
analysis (unless stated otherwise), as augmentation is required for
a better description of the higher multipole moments. In addition,
for calculating the molecular charge densities in the experimental
crystal conformations, hydrogen atom positions were corrected to standard
bond lengths (Caromatic–H = 1.08 Å, Csp3–H = 1.06 Å)66 to account
for the systematic error in X-ray structure determinations. The “ISA”
distributed multipoles (Qlmi) of each conformation
were calculated in the molecular axis frame (Figure S1) and derived using the most recent iterated stockholder
atom algorithm implemented in CAMCASP 6.0,67 the ISA-A algorithm.68 The ISA-A method
develops on the previous BS-ISA method in CAMCASP 5.9, which includes
a method for refitting the atomic electron density tails,31 by including another independent atomic basis
set. Therefore, the ISA-A algorithm in CAMCASP 6.0 contains three
bases:The main basis to calculate
the molecular orbitals.
In this study, an aug-cc-pVTZ basis set is used.

An auxiliary basis for refitting the atomic electron
density tails. This basis can take both Cartesian and spherical Gaussian-type
orbitals (GTOs). In this study, we use Cartesian GTOs of aug-cc-pVTZ
size.

And an atomic basis to determine
the ISA atomic expansions.
In this study, an aug-cc-pVQZ basis set is used as it is independent
of the main and auxiliary basis sets. However, the spherical coordinate
system for the GTOs must always be used.



The distributed multipole expansion is evaluated to hexadecapole
level (rank l = 4) so that the potential and energies
could be evaluated including all terms up to R–5 and so include the electrostatic effects due to lone-pair
and π atomic anisotropies. To test the transferability of the
multipole moments with changes in the NO2 torsion angle, Z matrices of these structures were created and the NO2 functional groups were rotated through 180° in 20°
increments, while the rest of the molecule was held rigid at the optimized
structure. The extent to which the nitro group torsion angles can
change in the condensed phase was investigated using histograms of
the frequency a O–N–X–C torsion angle (rounded
to nearest degree) occurred in the relevant organic crystal structures
found in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).69 The histograms were constructed for the four unique chemical
environments found in the four energetic molecules, with the most
commonly observed environment being a C–NO2 on an
aromatic ring with two adjacent hydrogen atoms (Table S1).

The ISA distributed multipoles can be analytically
rotated from
the molecular axes into the atomic local axes of the molecule, with
the z-axis along the X–N plane (along the
bond) and the x-axis into X–N=O plane
(perpendicular to the z-axis but in the plane of
the molecule) (Figure S1). Analytically
rotating the local axis-defined multipoles to a different X–NO2 torsion angle provides an electrostatic model that includes
the geometric effects of conformational change but does not explicitly
account for changes in the molecular charge distribution. Provided
that the non-NO2 torsion angles, bond lengths, and angles
are identical, it is possible to analytically rotate the multipoles
to represent the geometric change in torsion angles, using ORIENT
4.9.08,70 a methodology previously used
to study the transferability of electrostatic models between polypeptides.71

To focus solely on the effects of changing
NO2 torsion
angles and compare experimentally observed and optimized conformations,
the experimentally observed NO2 torsion angles were used,
while all of the bond lengths and angles and non-NO2 torsion
angles were kept rigid at their optimized values. These structures
and charge distributions calculated in this conformation are referred
to as the optexptNO2. In addition, multipole moments calculated
in the optimized conformation were analytically rotated into the optexptNO2 conformation. Charge distributions obtained this way are
referred to as anarot (analytically rotated). The electrostatic properties
obtained from the analytically rotated distributed multipoles can
then be contrasted with those acquired from calculating the charge
distribution in the optexptNO2 conformation, which also
accounts for the rearrangement of charge within the molecule, e.g.,
from changes in π conjugation. Analytical rotation can only
be applied to the nitroaromatic molecules, as the aromatic ring is
rigid and undergoes negligible changes when the molecules are optimized
and the nitro group rotates. Only the NO2 torsion angles
change between the optimized and observed conformations (Figure S2). However, for nitramines, like RDX,
there is a notable difference in the conformation of the aliphatic
ring in the experimental crystalline conformers and the optimized
conformation. The difference also results in a change in non-NO2 torsion angles upon optimization. Thus, changing only the
NO2 torsion angle in the optimized structure using the
standard Z-matrix definition (the optexptNO2 methodology) gives a structure that is different from the experimental
structure. Hence, it is not possible, let alone appropriate, to test
transferability by analytically rotating the multipoles of RDX (Figure S2 and Table S4).

Using the various
sets of distributed multipole moments, the electrostatic
potential was computed and mapped onto an isodensity surface of 10–3 electron/bohr3, using CAMCASP 6.0,67 which was visualized on the isolated molecular
structures using the ORIENT 4.9.0870 program.
This isodensity surface was chosen as the majority of electrostatic
potential studies on energetic materials and their sensitivities use
this surface, following the suggestion by Bader,72,73 as it can include more than 95% of a molecule’s true electronic
density. This surface has recently been used to define the molecular
volume for use in estimating the density of energetic materials.74 The electrostatic potential on this isodensity
surface is approximately 3 Å from the nearest nucleus in the
molecule and so gives the electrostatic potential sampled by the nonhydrogenic
nuclei that would be in van der Waals contact with the molecule in
the crystal. Lattice energies were calculated using a combination
of the ISA distributed multipoles, to obtain the electrostatic energy,
and the exp-6 FIT potential, for all other contributions using DMACRYS.75

Crystal structure analysis and visual
representations used the
analysis software of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, mainly
Mercury 3.6.42,43 Root-mean-square deviation (RMSDn) calculations, the optimum overlay of n (n ≤ 15 for crystal structures, n = 1 for molecular conformation comparisons) molecules
in two crystal structures excluding the hydrogen atoms, were also
done using Mercury.

Results
Molecular Electrostatic
Properties and Correlation with Impact
Sensitivity
The electrostatic potential around the static
optimized conformations of the four energetic molecules (Figure 2) clearly shows that
the electrostatic term will greatly influence intermolecular interactions
and hence explosive properties. Potential extrema (Vmax and Vmin) are influenced
by the molecular symmetry and not necessarily centralized around the
NO2 groups, in contrast to the measure of the local NO2 charge distribution Vmid. The
AAE and AAA crystalline conformations of RDX optimize to very different
geometries and therefore are conformational
polymorphs.76 The AAE conformation, with
one equatorial NO2 group, is the lower-symmetry, higher-energy
conformation of RDX and occurs in the most stable α polymorph
and one of the two independent molecules in the high-pressure γ
form. It has a different surface shape and potential minimum (Vmin), but the potential maximum for this bowl-shaped
molecule is virtually unaffected. The nitramine RDX has a significantly
larger gradient in the electrostatic potential around the molecule
than any of the flatter nitroaromatics.

multipole analysis (ISA-DMA) on the isodensity surface of 10–3 electron/bohr3 around the static optimized isolated molecular
structures of TNB, HNB, TNT, and RDX. Note that for some of the above
molecules the maximum, Vmax is greater
than the potential scale, which is +1 eV (red) to −1 eV (blue).
Alternative h50%/cm measurements5,44,77,78 have been included in parentheses.

The variations in charges on the X and N atoms in the X–NO2 groups of the optimized conformations are contrasted with
X–NO2 groups in the experimentally observed condensed-phase
conformations that have the most unique structures (Table S2). This clearly shows that the nitrogen atoms in the
N–NO2 groups in RDX are more positively charged
(0.882–0.945e) than any nitrogen in the aromatic
C–NO2 groups (0.749–0.852e), and even within the C–NO2 groups, the charge
distributions are far from transferable (as seen in the atomic charges
in Figure 1). Changes
in conformation result in variations in the trigger-bond parameter Vmid (both longest and average) that can be comparable
to the conformational differences between molecules (Table S2). The values of Vmid differ
more between the molecules but also vary between the different crystalline
conformations.

On comparing the molecular electrostatic properties Vmax and Vmid against
experimental
impact sensitivity (Figure 3), one observes that conformational changes due to crystallization
do affect these properties. There is a notable spread in Vmax and Vmid of the optimized
and observed conformations in the nitrobenzenes TNB and TNT. This
will significantly affect any correlation with impact sensitivity
for the nitrobenzenes. Furthermore, for RDX, the spread of values
for either Vmax and Vmid is not substantially larger than that for TNB despite
RDX having many large conformational changes (Figures 1 and S1).

impact sensitivities (h50%) for the three

its observed h50% has been obtained from
a different source.50 The variations between
the optimized and the most different crystalline conformations, HNB(opt
≈ expt), TNB(opt ≈ form III, molecule 1 in form I, molecule
2 in form II), TNT(opt, α), and RDX(opt(AAA), opt (AAE), α(AAE),
and ε(AAA)), are shown. The atomic charge variations and other
electrostatic properties (including Vmid,longest, Vmin) are given in Table S3, along with the plotted values.

Modeling the Electrostatic Contribution to Lattice Energies
How much variation is likely within the crystalline state and how
does this affect atomic charges? Analysis of the NO2 torsion
angles in the crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database
(CSD) shows that an aromatic NO2 group adjacent to two
hydrogen substituents is almost always planar, to within 20°,
which corresponds to a fairly small change in conformational energy,
as shown for the para-nitro group in TNT in Figure 4. There is a large
barrier of about 25 kJ/mol for rotating the nitro group, presumably
from changes in π electron conjugation. The atomic charge on
C4 (the carbon bound to the para-NO2)
rises, while those on the neighboring C3 and C5 fall. We find that
the atomic charge on N2 is mainly responsible for the charge balance.
Additionally, the dipole moments on the nitro O atoms change significantly
with rotation. A similar picture is seen for the NO2 groups
in TNB (Figure S3a), which are also adjacent
to aromatic C–H groups. The picture is very different for the ortho-nitro groups in TNT (Figure 4), where a large range of torsion angles
are observed for the NO2 between a methyl and hydrogen
substituents on an aromatic ring. Here, the planar conformation is
the most commonly observed in the crystal structures, but this corresponds
to a maximum in the intramolecular energy. There is a known preference
for planar, extended conformations of molecules in the crystalline
state as this often allows a denser
packing.79 The height of the energy barrier
is probably overestimated because of the methyl group being fixed
in the calculation and hence sterically clashing with the NO2 group, whereas in the crystal structure, the methyl could rotate
out of the way. However, one should note that the crystallographic
angle in the CSD is an average over the torsional vibrations of the
methyl and nitro groups. In the ortho case, the charges and dipoles
change on many more atoms, though again the dipoles change most on
the nitro-oxygen atoms. While this effect is probably exaggerated
by the steric clash, it highlights the effects of changing π
conjugation between the nitro groups and the aromatic ring.

Figure 4 Conformational
behavior of the para-nitro (left)
and ortho-nitro (right) groups in TNT. The behavior
as a function of torsion angle is given for (top to bottom) the distribution
of the observed angles in the CSD for each environment; the change
in PBE0/aug-cc-VTZ energy relative to the optimized molecule as the
nitro group torsion angle is changed; and the relative changes in
the magnitude of ISA charge and dipole on each atom. The oxygens that
undergo the most significant changes in dipole moment have been indicated,
and the optimized NO2 torsion angles are also illustrated,
alongside other more notable NO2 torsion angles.

There is far sparser CSD data
for an aromatic NO2 between
two other NO2 groups (HNB), suggesting that any angle could
be observed (Figure S3b). Nonetheless,
the height of the conformational energy barrier is so great that without
allowing for a concerted and highly correlated change in the other
NO2 torsion angles the range of angles seen in other crystalline
conformations would not occur in HNB. There is even less CSD data
for N–NO2 groups (Figure S3c), as seen in the analysis of the AAE conformer of RDX. We find that
there are significant variations in some of the atomic charges and
dipoles for the ring nitrogen and the attached NO2 atoms.
Overall, from Figure 4, it is clear that the nitro group can adopt a range of conformations,
as a compromise between the intramolecular steric hindrance and the
crystal packing forces, and that these changes in conformation do
affect the nitro group charge distribution, resulting in very different
charge distributions for various NO2 environments.

The difference maps in Figure 5 show the extent to which the changes in charge distribution,
from the rearrangement of the valence electrons, affect the electrostatic
potential around each nitroaromatic molecule. The difference between
the potential calculated for optexptNO2 and anarot multipole
moments is shown. The differences are very dependent on the extent
to which the torsion angles differ between the optimized and experimental
structures, ranging from being negligible for TNB to underestimating Vmin by nearly 0.3 eV for TNT.

potential around the nitroaromatic
molecules for charge distributions calculated with the NO2 groups in their experimentally observed torsion angles (optexptNO2) and those analytically rotated from the PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ
optimized molecular structure (anarot) viewed from above and below.
The potential is mapped onto an isodensity surface of 10–3 electron/bohr3 in electron-volts (eV), and the scale
varies from molecule to molecule. The RMSD1 for the overlays
of the optimized (gray) and optimized with experimental NO2 torsion angles, optexptNO2 (red), molecular conformations,
for each nitroaromatic are included for comparison and given in Å.

Table 1 illustrates
how analytically rotating the atomic multipole moments affects the
intermolecular lattice energy (UINT).
For TNT, which has the largest NO2 torsion angle difference
between experimental and optimized structures, there is a significant
change in the lattice energies of TNT (Table 1). However, the effect of anarot multipoles
on the minimized lattice parameters and hence potential energy surface
minima is negligible. The small change in the lattice energy of TNB
reflects the very small differences in the torsion angles upon crystallization.
The lattice energy differences are mainly due to variation in the
electrostatic contributions (Uelst) as
changes in the dispersion–repulsion terms (Udisp–rep) arise only from the change in the lattice
structure. Even though the relative lattice energies are not well
reproduced when rotated multipole moments are employed, the low RMSD15 values indicate that the crystal geometries differ insignificantly.
This is also illustrated by the overlays in Figure S3. Hence, the anarot distributed multipole model, which assumes
that the atomic charge distributions can be analytically rotated with
changes in the NO2 torsion angle, reproduces the experimental
polymorph structures satisfactorily enough to be used in CSP for initial
analysis of the potential energy landscape.

Discussion
We find that the crystalline and isolated (optimized) conformations
of most molecular explosive materials differ significantly, providing
a challenge in evaluating the thermodynamic stability of their polymorphs
even at ambient conditions,81 let alone
at the high temperatures and pressures sampled during detonation.
This study highlights the effects of the changes in the NO2 torsion angles that can occur upon crystallization, how these can
differ between polymorphs, and its importance in accurate predictive
modeling.

The experimental polymorphs studied show a range of
crystalline
conformations that are fairly typical of those seen in all of the
other nitroaromatic and nitramines in the Cambridge Structural Database
(CSD). When the adjacent functional groups on the aromatic ring (or
C–N–NO2 chain, e.g., RDX) are hydrogen atoms,
then the NO2 torsion angles vary by about ±20°
and the nitro groups are relatively planar (Figures 4 and S3a). On
the other hand, when the adjacent functional groups are larger, any
angle may be observed (Figures 4 and S3b). In the isolated molecule,
the interactions with the specific neighboring substituents can have
a major effect on the charge distribution and torsion angle of a nitro
group; however, in the condensed phase, correlated changes in substituent
conformation are more affected by crystal packing. On comparing NO2 torsion in Figure 1, the nitroaromatics show differing degrees of conformational
adjustment due to the packing forces within the crystal lattice. HNB
has only one crystal structure, but the six nitro groups have different
torsion angles ranging between 48 and 60°, losing its molecular
symmetry and reflecting the compromises between the intramolecular
steric forces and the adaption to intermolecular interactions to give
a dense crystal. The TNT polymorphs have rather similar crystalline
conformations as they are polytypic, comprising of different stacks
of comparable layers of molecules.6,82 Nonetheless,
the two independent molecules in each polymorph show variations in
the torsion angles of the ortho-NO2 groups
that sterically interact with the methyl, and the para-NO2 groups are not coplanar. The optimized TNB molecule
is planar, but the four crystalline conformations in the two polymorphs
have torsion angles that are up to 32° from planar. Thus, crystal
packing forces can easily overcome intramolecular stabilization from
conjugation, shifting nitro groups from their preferred planar conformation.

Using an improved novel method of partitioning the isolated molecular
charge distribution (ISA) and a high level of theory (PBE0/aug-cc-VTZ)
to obtain realistic atomic charges and higher-order multipole moments
for an X–NO2 group shows that the NO2 charge density differs considerably between N–NO2 and C–NO2 (Figure 1 and Table S2). Moreover,
the charge density varies significantly with the neighboring functional
groups (e.g., ortho- and para-groups in TNT, Figure 1) and also with the NO2 torsion
angle. This is to be expected as the atomic charges, in particular,
reflect the changes in valence electron distribution, which also determine
the molecular reactivity. Our study shows that the published empirical
correlations of local electrostatic properties around the NO2 “trigger bond”, such as Vmid, or the molecular property Vmax with
the crystal property, impact sensitivity (h50%),1,59,83 will be significantly
affected by the neglect of the conformational change (Figure 3 and Table S2).

The packing arrangement of the reactive groups in
the crystal will
also strongly affect the energetic properties. The early correlation
between detonation properties and density led to the development of
MOLPAK,84 one of the first crystal structure
prediction (CSP) codes, which sought to establish the possible density
of a crystal from the molecular structure. Since then, CSP methods
have evolved to help predict possible polymorphs and help support
their structural characterization from powder X-ray diffraction and
other analytical techniques. While these techniques are being extensively
developed for the pharmaceutical industry,85,86 the much-needed extension to energetic materials requires fundamentally
different modeling of specific functional groups under the extreme
conditions unique to explosives. For example, periodic density functional
calculations on crystalline nitroguanidine required the development
of a specific dispersion correction.87 This
paper has established the care required in CSP studies of nitroaromatic
explosives to ensure that the large variations in possible NO2 torsion angles, shown by the CSD distributions (Figures 4 and S3), are effectively considered. It is the balance
between the molecular cost for the conformational change (ΔEintra) and the improved intermolecular lattice
energy (UINT) from a denser packing, which
determine the total lattice energy (Elatt = ΔEintra + UINT). Ab initio calculations on the molecule (Ψmol) can be used to obtain ΔEintra and analyzed to obtain the atomic multipoles, polarizabilities,
and dispersion coefficients that determine the long-range intermolecular
forces. In this study, the ISA analysis of Ψmol provides
an anisotropic intermolecular potential with the atomic multipole
moments being used to calculate the electrostatic contribution to
the intermolecular energy. It seems that cell geometries can be obtained
relatively accurately and very quickly without recalculating the charge
density as the nitro groups rotate (Table 1), by analytically rotating the multipole
moments. This suggests that the anarot methodology could be used to
determine the range of low-energy crystal structures that could be
adopted by a nitroaromatic energetic molecule within the Ψmol approach to crystal structure prediction88 and thus could improve the prediction of crystal packing
from the molecular diagram of new energetic molecules.74 This method is suitable as an initial approximation
of the potential energy landscape, but the relative energy differences
in Table 1 are large
in comparison with the lattice energy differences between polymorphs,
which are usually much less than 5 kJ mol–1 for
small molecules.89 The conclusion that
analytical rotation does not reproduce relative electrostatic energies
well was also reached in the study on the transferability of electrostatic
models between polypeptides.71 Thus, Table 1 shows that in the
Ψmol approach, it is necessary to use an accurate
molecular charge distribution for the refinement of CSP-generated
crystal structures, or a sufficiently accurate periodic electronic
structure calculation, to determine the relative lattice energies
reliably and accurately enough to know which of the generated crystal
structures are thermodynamically plausible polymorphs.88

The complexity of the processes that determine
the impact sensitivity
and other key properties of the polymorphs of energetic materials48 implies that multiscale modeling, involving
both periodic electronic structure calculations and MD simulations,
will be required. The MD codes will need to use the best nonempirical
models for the inter- and intramolecular forces derived directly from
the molecular charge distribution. These models will be specific to
the molecule, as the charge distribution around the nitro groups is
clearly affected by changes in the rest of the molecule, particularly
the adjacent functional groups or with the presence of an aromatic
ring. This study implies that there will be a significant loss in
accuracy if novel intermolecular potentials do not include a NO2 torsion angle dependence. It could be possible to fit analytical
models to changes in atomic multipoles,90 as Figure 4 shows
that the ISA atomic multipoles change smoothly with NO2 torsion angle and therefore can be modeled using splines, or other
functions of low complexity. However, while it is clear how these
changes can be modeled as a function of a single degree of freedom
(single torsion), the correlated conformational adjustments of neighboring
groups on the aromatic ring may pose a challenge. The changes in multipole
moments during the rotation of the methyl group in TNT, let alone
with changes in the aliphatic ring seen for RDX (Figure S2), will not be represented by a simple Fourier series
term, and this will also apply to the conformational energy penalty.91 Considering the polymorphs of energetic molecules
and CSP studies provide a good starting point for developing the next
generation of molecule-specific flexible force fields. This, in turn,
will help contribute to the development of predictive computational
modeling of their key physical properties such as free energies, thermal
expansion, and other nonreactive properties.

Conclusions
The
charge distributions of the nitro groups in TNB, TNT, HNB,
and RDX vary considerably depending on the bonded and neighboring
functional groups and also with the conformational differences between
their polymorphs and their isolated molecular structures. The rigorous
ISA partitioning of high-quality molecular charge distributions allows
us to obtain the distributed multipole representation of the atomic
charge distribution, which has minimal sensitivity to basis set, and
hence, artifacts of conformational change are minimized. We have shown,
using ISA partitioning, that variations in NO2 conformations
that occur in crystal structures cause sufficient changes in the molecular
charge to affect previously proposed empirical correlations between
impact sensitivity and molecular electrostatic properties.

The
condensed-phase torsion angles observed for nitro groups are
a subtle balance between inter- and intramolecular interactions. The
charge distributions of the nitro groups, and some neighboring atoms,
can change significantly with the NO2 torsion angle, reflecting
the change in the bonding and molecular charge distribution. This
change is sufficiently large that distributed multipole models, which
form the basis of nonempirical model intermolecular potentials, should
be calculated for each conformation if the potential is to be accurate
enough to model lattice energies to the accuracy needed to predict
polymorph relative stability. However, analytically rotating the multipoles
to reflect the change in aromatic NO2 torsion angles is
a reasonable approximation that may be useful in performing fast crystal
structure prediction calculations. This study utilizes old and new
computational methodologies in a novel way to establish the necessary
assumptions about the transferability of charge distribution in nitroaromatic
explosives. These assumptions will be instrumental in producing reliable
nonempirical potentials suitable for modeling possible polymorphs,
particularly those crystallized under pressure.92
