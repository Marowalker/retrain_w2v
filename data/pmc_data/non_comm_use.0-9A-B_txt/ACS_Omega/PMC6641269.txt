Rollover
C–H activation with transition-metal complexes
has been found to be a difficult but viable pathway to functionalize
potentially chelating molecules, which are otherwise reluctant to
react further. However, selective rollover or nonrollover C–H
activation pathway depends on the stereoelectronic demand of the associated
organometallic intermediate(s). The presented work addresses the above
issue on abnormal N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) platform. Catalytic
reactions of pyridine-imidazolium substrates with internal alkynes
have been selectively guided toward either rollover or nonrollover
C–H functionalization route via fulfilling the steric and electronic
demands of the relevant rhodium(III)–abnormal NHC metallacyclic
intermediates.

Introduction
Transition-metal-catalyzed
C–H bond activation functionalization
of organic molecules is a vast and versatile research area.1 Obviously, numerous chemical strategies have
been developed over the years to achieve such versatility via exploiting
various ways of activating the C–H bonds within organic molecules.
A recent addition to the existing strategies is “rollover C–H
activation” protocol,2 the catalytic
version of which has been applied successfully to functionalize strongly
chelating (bidentate/tridentate) organic molecules.3 The basic problem associated with rollover C–H activation
in chelating molecules is facile formation of a stable metallachelate,
which is resistant to reopen via decomplexation, thus inhibiting the
activation of the C–H bond (Figure 1a). Hence, examples of successful catalytic
protocols involving rollover C–H activation functionalization
are still limited.3 These include C–H
cyanation of arylimidazo[1,2-α]pyridines (by the Song and Hao
group),3a C–H diamination of arylpyridines
(by the Lu group)3b and purines (by the
Chang group),3c and annulation of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines (by the Li group).3d Later, the Chang group developed elegant protocols for rollover
functionalization of pyridine ligand-based strong bidentate (2,2′-bipyridines)
and tridentate (2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridines) molecules.3e,3f In parallel, recently, our group has addressed an interesting Cp*Rh-catalyzed
switchable rollover C–H functionalization of imidazolium ring-containing
organic molecules, which are potentially strong chelators based on
pyridine–normal N-heterocyclic carbene (nNHC)
bidentate motif (Figure 1b).3g Through this chemistry, one can
achieve a variety of fused cationic imidazopyridinium structures in
just one step. Notably, cationic, ring-fused N-heterocycles represent
an important class of organic compounds recognized to be of significant
interest in diverse research areas, including bioactivity,4 materials chemistry,5 supramolecular chemistry,6 etc.

Figure 1 “Rollover”
vs “nonrollover” C–H
activation functionalization.

As evident from the above-mentioned rollover C–H functionalization
strategies, stereoelectronic factors operating at the catalytic metal
center play a pivotal role for the success in overcoming such a high
activation barrier rollover process to initiate the subsequent C–H
bond cleavage step. For instance, ligand trans effect, intramolecular
H-bonding, and water-assisted H-bonding were proposed as the driving
force (Figure 1a).3a−3f After the success with pyridine–nNHC moieties,3g the question of stereoelectronically controlled
“switchable” rollover strategy on an abnormal NHC (aNHC)–pyridine bidentate chelating motif has been
addressed in this work (Figure 1c). aNHC, being a stronger σ-donor
than nNHC, enhances nucleophilicity of the bound
metal center of a complex, resulting in acid sensitivity and demetalation
of the corresponding complexes.7 Hence,
selective functionalization of these moieties remains a challenge.
To the best of our knowledge, stoichiometric or catalytic functionalization
of M–aNHC motif is still unknown. Herein,
we not only show catalytic functionalization of this motif with internal
alkynes but also demonstrate on how the relevant steric and electronic
factors of a cyclometalated intermediate can trigger the reaction
pathway toward either pyridine rollover, followed by C–C annulation,
or direct alkenylation without any rollover step (Figure 1c).

Results and Discussion
Our investigation started with the reaction between 2,3-dimethyl-1-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-3-ium hexafluorophosphate (1a) (0.11
mmol) and diphenylacetylene (2a) (0.1 mmol) in the presence
of [Cp*RhIIICl2]2 (0.003 mmol) as
catalyst precursor, NaOAc (0.5 mmol) as base, and AgOTf (0.25 mmol)
as oxidant in dichloroethane (DCE) at a temperature of 110 °C
under argon atmosphere. This reaction afforded the nonrollover-alkenylated
product 3a in 86% isolated yield after 24 h (Scheme 1). The structure
of 3a was confirmed unambiguously by NMR, electrospray
ionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) techniques. At room temperature, the yield was only 49%, whereas
the reaction under oxygen atmosphere and in the absence of AgOTf did
not furnish any product. Furthermore, optimization studies (see Supporting Information, SI) showed that the presence
of catalyst and NaOAc was required in such reactions. To broaden the
scope of this catalytic protocol at the aNHC platform,
further reactions of other various heteroarene-substituted imidazolium
salts with different internal alkynes were carried out to get alkenylated
products (3b–d) in moderate to good
yields, as shown in Scheme 1. Details of the imidazolium salts (1a–f) and internal alkynes (2a–e) are
provided in the Supporting Information.
Different N-substituents, such as benzyl, in the imidazolium substrate
provided good yield (80%) of the corresponding product (3e) with 4-octyne (2b).

Scheme 1 Examples of Nonrollover
Alkenylation and Rollover Annulation Catalysis
The reaction with substituted pyridyl systems
featured interesting
results depending on the stereoelectronic nature of the substituent
and alkyne. Thus, with OMe substituent adjacent to the pyridine nitrogen
atom, the reaction provided only alkenylated products with both aliphatic
and aromatic alkynes (3f, 86%; 3g, 76%).
However, quinoline-substituted imidazolium substrate yielded alkenylated
products (3h, 79%; 3i; 73%) with aliphatic
alkynes, such as 4-octyne and 1-phenyl-1-butyne, but annulated product
(4f, 88%) with diphenylacetylene. Reaction of methyl-substituted
system with aliphatic alkyne, 4-octyne, provided alkenylated product
in minor amount (3j, 35%) and annulated product in major
quantity (4a, 60%). The selectivity was completely switched
to annulated product (4b, 92%) when aromatic alkyne,
diphenylacetylene, was employed. With substantial steric bias, tert-butyl substituent resulted in annulated products (4c, 79%; 4d, 84%; 4e, 80%) regardless
of the nature of the incoming alkyne electrophile. Finally, when a
very much electron-deficient alkyne was used as internal alkyne partner,
rollover-annulated product (4g, 75%) was observed even
with unsubstituted imidazolium moiety. It was apparent that the above
switchable nonrollover versus rollover C–H functionalization
catalysis at the aNHC platform was due to a collective
output from the electronic effect of incoming alkyne and steric and
directing effects generated by the pyridine substituent adjacent to
the donor nitrogen atom. In this regard, recent elegant examples of
switchable selectivity in C–H activation/functionalization
chemistry based on controlling the nature of organometallic intermediates
within the catalytic cycle are noteworthy.8 As seen from Scheme 1, without any substituent, no rollover was observed for pyridine
moiety except when the alkyne was very much electron-deficient 4,4′-dinitrodiphenyl
acetylene (4g). Ligation of such an electron-deficient
alkyne to the metal center of the metallacycle intermediate prompted
it to meet its electronic demand, which could be offered by Rh–C
bond formation via rollover C–H activation. For the case of tert-butyl substitution, immediate rollover intermediate
formation was expected owing to mainly steric effect. Hence, all products
were of annulated type for this substituent. Any less electron-deficient
alkynes, such as 4-octyne or 1-phenyl-1-butyne, were not sufficient
to push the rollover process in most of the other cases.

The
above stereoelectronically guided switchable nonrollover versus
rollover C–H functionalization behavior prompted us to look
into the mechanistic aspect of this process. To gain insight into
the probable reaction steps involved in the catalytic cycle, a series
of control experiments were performed. First and foremost, isolation
of a series of aNHC–pyridine nonrollover rhodium(III)
intermediates 5a–d was accomplished
in excellent yields (80–89%) from the reaction of the corresponding
imidazolium substrates (1) and [Cp*RhIIICl2]2 in DCE under inert atmosphere using NaOAc as
base (Scheme 2a). All
of these intermediates were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and
mass spectrometry analyses (see SI). Moreover,
the molecular structures of 5a and 5d were
also determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses (see SI for details). Intermediacy of these complexes
into the alkenylation catalytic cycle was confirmed by successfully
performing catalytic as well as stoichiometric reactions of a representative
complex 5a with different alkynes to obtain the desired
nonrollover-alkenylated products in good yields (Scheme 2 and Supporting Information). For the catalytic reaction, proton (H+) from acetic acid (AcOH) formed after the deprotonation of the imidazolium
C–H bond of the substrate with NaOAc or adventitious H2O present in the reaction mixture could have promoted the
required protodemetalation step to furnish the alkenylated product 3b (Scheme 2b). The successful stoichiometric formation of the alkenylated product 3b from the intermediate 5a both in the absence
(Scheme 2c) and presence
(Scheme 2d) of added
AcOH was the basis for the above speculation.

Scheme 2 Control Studies for
Alkenylation Reaction
To understand the rollover process, the representative
intermediate 5b was reacted with stoichiometric amounts
of AgOTf and NaOAc
in CD3CN at 45 °C for 30 min. The analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum suggested the rollover C–H activation/cyclometalation
at the pyridine ring (Scheme 3a, and Supporting Information).
A similar control experiment but in the absence of NaOAc did not result
such rollover cyclometalation, suggesting the crucial role of NaOAc
as base for this process. Interestingly, the above rollover process
was also found to proceed with the other intermediates (5c and 5d) in the presence of AgOTf and NaOAc (see Supporting Information for details), although
the catalytic reaction yielded different products (either nonrollover-alkenylated
or rollover-annulated) from the corresponding imidazolium substrates
(see Scheme 1). This
fact suggested that not only there exists an equilibrium between the
nonrollover and rollover rhodium(III) intermediates under the reaction
condition, but also the final reaction toward either the nonrollover
alkenylation or rollover annulation pathway is decided by the energy
barrier of the overall reaction (or the rate-determining step), which
was guided by the steric and electronic influence from the substituents
present on the imidazolium and alkyne substrates. Detailed computational
studies will be undertaken in future to examine this aspect. In fact,
the reversibility of the rollover process was checked by adding an
equivalent amount of AcOH into the solution containing the rollover
intermediate (Scheme 3b). The regeneration of the starting nonrollover aNHC–pyridine coordinated motif confirmed the high feasibility
of such reversibility in the actual catalytic reaction. The formation
of the rollover-annulated product 4b from the stoichiometric
reaction of the intermediate 5b with aromatic alkyne
in the presence of AgOTf and NaOAc (Scheme 3c) confirmed the existence of a reaction
sequence involving rollover C–H activation/cyclometalation
at the coordinated pyridine ring, followed by alkyne insertion and
reductive elimination. Intermediate 5b was also found
to be active in a control catalytic experiment for the annulation
reaction (Scheme 3d),
reconfirming its intermediacy in the catalysis.

Scheme 3 Control Studies for
Annulation Reaction
On the basis of the results of the mechanistic investigation
described
above and related previous works,3g,9 we proposed
a catalytic cycle as depicted in Scheme 4. The pathway involves the initial formation
of an aNHC–pyridine-coordinated rhodacycle
intermediate 5, which can transform into a solvento complex 5′ after halide abstraction by AgOTf. The incoming
alkyne coordinates (Anr) and
inserts into the Rh–C(aNHC) bond to form intermediate Bnr, which finally gives away the
alkenylated product 3 via protodemetalation in the presence
of in situ generated AcOH (or adventitious H2O). On the
other hand, intermediate 5 can undergo pyridine rollover
C–H activation/cyclometalation in the presence of NaOAc after
halide abstraction by AgOTf, giving rise to intermediate 6. To 6, alkyne coordinates (Ar) and inserts into Rh–C(Py) bond to form a seven-membered
intermediate Br. The intermediate Br undergoes reductive elimination
to furnish the annulated product 4 and Rh(I) species,
which is oxidized back to Rh(III) by AgOTf to continue the catalytic
cycle. Observation of a silvery layer on inner walls of the reaction
vessel because of the presence of elemental silver is in accordance
with the reductive elimination step. A detailed mechanistic investigation
will be the subject of future study.

Conclusions
In a nutshell, this work exhibited a switchable
C–H bond
functionalization of pyridine-imidazolium chelating substrates to
nonrollover alkenylation or rollover annulation products with internal
alkynes on an exclusive abnormal Rh–NHC platform. Mechanistic
investigation, including isolation, characterization, and control
reactions of several organometallic rhodacyclic intermediates, highlighted
the crucial role of stereoelectronic effects exerted by the substrate
and alkyne backbones in the process of this bimodal reactivity. The
mechanistic path was a result of a collective output of contributions
from steric at the metallacycle involved and the electronic nature
of the incoming alkyne electrophile.
