To obtain positive electrode materials
with higher energy densities
(Ws), we performed systematic structural and electrochemical
analyses for LiCoxMn2–xO4 (LCMO) with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. X-ray diffraction measurements and Raman spectroscopy
clarified that the samples with x ≤ 0.5 are
in the single-phase of a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, whereas the samples with x ≥ 0.75 are in a mixture of the spinel-phase and
Li2MnO3 phase with the C2/m space group. The x-dependence of the
discharge capacity (Qdis) indicated a
broad maximum at x = 0.5, although the average operating
voltage (Eave) monotonically increased
with x. Thus, the W value obtained
by Qdis × Eave reached the maximum (=627 mW h·g–1) at x = 0.5, which is greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. Furthermore, the change
in the lattice volume (ΔV) during charge and
discharge reactions approached 0%, that is, zero-strain, at x = 1. Because ΔV for x = 0.5 was smaller than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4, the x = 0.5 sample is found to be
an alternative positive electrode material for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 with a high W.

1 Introduction
The
bottom line of batteries in baseball is the harmonizing of
a pitcher and a catcher. In the same way, the balancing of the electrochemical
performances between a positive electrode and a negative electrode
is crucial for secondary batteries. As previously reviewed for lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs),1,2 the energy densities (Ws) for positive electrode materials are significantly lower
than those for negative electrode materials. This imbalanced situation
still restricts the widespread applications of LIBs, such as in electric
vehicles (EVs) and stationary energy storage systems (ESSs).1 In other words, positive electrode materials
with higher Ws are urgently required to realize more
practical EVs and ESSs.

The W value for a positive
electrode material
is determined as follows 1  where Qrecha is
the rechargeable capacity and Eave is
the average operation voltage. Therefore, a positive electrode material
with a high Qrecha or a high Eave or both provides a high W. Over the
past decade, lithium–nickel–manganese spinel Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 has attracted much attention
because it offers ∼135 mA h·g–1 of Qrecha and 4.5 V versus Li+/Li of Eave, resulting in more than 600 mW h·g–1 of W.3−6 Lithium–cobalt–manganese spinel
LiCoxMn2–xO4 (LCMO) with 0 ≤ x ≤
1 is also promising from the viewpoint of Eave;7−13 namely, the redox reaction of Co3+ ↔ Co4+ in LCMO is ∼0.3 V higher than that of Ni2+ ↔
Ni4+ in Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4.3,4,8,9,11

Previous X-ray absorption
near-edge structure (XANES)8 analyses and
magnetic measurements of electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR)14,15 and susceptibility16 indicated that Co ions in LCMO are in the trivalent
state with a low-spin t2g6 (S = 0) configuration. The ideal electrochemical
reaction of LCMO is thus represented as 2  where the theoretical
capacity (Qtheo) is calculated to be (148.23
– 3.21x) mA h·g–1.
The current Qrecha for x = 1 is, however,
significantly lower than Qtheo and is
usually7−11 limited to ∼100 or 116 mA h·g–1 at
the maximum.13 This comes from the presence
of Li2MnO3 impurities in x =
1, which are electrochemically inactive.9 By contrast, the Eave for LCMO almost
linearly increases on increasing the amount of the Co3+ ↔ Co4+ redox reaction. Because W is the product obtained by the multiplication of Qrecha and Eave, as shown by eq 1, the opposite trend between Qrecha and Eave in
LCMO is expected to indicate a maximum W value at
a certain x composition. Despite the intensive studies
on LCMO thus far,7−16 a systematic study to explore the optimum x composition
for the highest W has not been undertaken.

In this contribution, we report the results of Qrecha, Eave, and W as a function of x in LCMO and compare them with
Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. Structural analyses
using synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and
Raman spectroscopy were also performed to clarify the relation between
the electrochemical properties and crystal structures of LCMO. Consequently,
we revealed that the x = 0.5 composition provides
the maximum W value of 627 mW h·g–1, with a change in the lattice volume of ∼4%. These performances
were found to be superior to those of Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Particle Morphology
For positive
electrode materials with high Eave values,
the particle size and morphology significantly affect their electrochemical
properties,17 probably due to the decomposition
of electrolytes. To clarify changes in the particle size and morphology
with x, Figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
for the LCMO samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x = 1. The x = 0 sample indicates a nonuniform particle shape with an average
particle size (dave) of 2 μm. For
the x = 0.5 and 1 samples, some particles show a
truncated octahedral shape, although their dave values are similar to that of the x =
0 sample. As seen in Figure S1, particles
for the x = 0.25 and 0.5 samples also show a truncated
octahedral shape with dave of ∼2
μm. Thus, the substitution of Co ions for Mn ions mainly influences
the particle morphology for LCMO.

Figure 1 SEM images on the 5 μm scale for
the LiCoxMn2–xO4 samples
with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and
(c) x = 1. One of the particles in the x = 1 sample (surrounded by the red dotted line) shows a truncated
octahedron with a facet growth velocity ratio (α) of 2.25 <
α < 2.5.

The Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 particles
prepared by the two-step solid-state reaction technique exhibit an
octahedral shape with smooth {111} facets, not a truncated octahedral
shape.17 The difference between the octahedral
and truncated octahedral shapes originates from the proportion of
the {001} facets to {111} facets. One simple method to quantitatively
describe such a difference is given by the Wulff construction18 3  where α is the facet growth velocity
ratio and V001 and V111 are the growth velocities of the {001} and {111} facets,
respectively. When α = 1, the particle indicates only the {001}
facets, that is, cubic, whereas when α = 3, the particle indicates
only the {111} facets, that is, regular octahedron.18 As seen from the x = 1 particle surrounded
by a red dotted line in Figure 1c, the surface area of one {001} facet is estimated to be
1.1 μm2, whereas that of one {111} facet is estimated
to be 3.9 μm2. Thus, the ratio of the {001} facets
to {111} facets is estimated to be ∼0.2, resulting in 2.25
< α < 2.5.

2.2 Electrochemistry
Figure 2 shows the
charge and discharge
curves of the LCMO/Li cells with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.25, (c) x = 0.5, (d) x = 0.75, and (e) x = 1. For the x = 0 sample, the cell voltage rapidly increases to ∼4.0 V,
then maintains an almost constant voltage at around 4.2 V up to a
charge capacity (Qcha) of ∼80 mA
h·g–1, and finally indicates another voltage
plateau at around 5.2 V. The voltage plateau above 5.0 V is also reported
for the charge curves for Li[LixMn2–x]O4 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3.19,20 The Qcha and discharge capacity (Qdis) at the initial cycle are 126 and 119 mA h·g–1, respectively. For the x = 0.25 and 0.5 samples,
the Qcha values below ∼4.0 V decrease
compared with that for x = 0; and in turn, the Qcha values above ∼5.0 V increase with x. The Qcha and Qdis values at the initial cycle are not different between
the x = 0.25 and 0.5 samples; that is, the Qcha and Qdis values
are 147 and 138 mA h·g–1, respectively, for x = 0.25, and the Qcha and Qdis values are 146 and 140 mA h·g–1, respectively, for x = 0.5. However, as clearly
seen from the intersecting voltages between the charge and discharge
curves, the Eave value for x = 0.5 is expected to be greater than that for x = 0.25.

Figure 2 Charge and discharge curves of the LiCoxMn2–xO4/Li cells with
(a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.25, (c) x = 0.5, (d) x = 0.75, and (e) x = 1. The cells were operated at a current of 0.6 mA (0.3
mA·cm–2) in the voltage range between 3.0 and
5.4 V at 25 °C.

For the x = 0.75 sample, the Qcha value at around 4.0 V is decreased to ∼25 mA
h·g–1; however, the whole Qcha (=134 mA h·g–1) and Qdis (=127 mA h·g–1) values
at the initial cycle are slightly decreased compared with those for x = 0.25 and 0.5. For the x = 1 sample,
the Qcha and Qdis values at the initial cycle are further decreased to 112 and 108
mA h·g–1, respectively, in exchange for the
almost disappearance of the Qcha value
at around 4.0 V. Such Qcha and Qdis values are similar to the reported values
for x = 1.7−13 According to the previous XANES analyses8 and EPR measurements,14,15 the electrochemical
reaction at around 4.0 V is attributed to the redox reaction of Mn3+ ↔ Mn4+, whereas that at around 5.0 V is
attributed to the redox reaction of Co3+ ↔ Co4+. The small amount of Qdis at
around 4.0 V in x = 1 indicates that the Mn3+ ions still exist in the sample, although its ideal chemical formula
is described as Li[Co3+Mn4+]O4. Figure S2 shows the charge and discharge curves
for the x = 1 sample prepared at 1000 and 1100 °C.
As the maximum heating temperature increases, the Qdis value decreases; for example, Qdis = 72 mA h·g–1 for 1100 °C.
This is because the amount of the Li2MnO3 impurity
increases, as later shown in Figures 4c and 6c.

Figure 3 shows the x-dependence of (a) Qdis at
the initial cycle, (b) Eave of the initial
discharge curve, and (c) W obtained by Qdis × Eave. Results of
Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 with the P4332 space group5 are also shown for comparison. The x-dependence
of Qdis indicates a broad maximum at around x = 0.5, whereas Eave almost
monotonically increases from 4.166 V at x = 0 to
4.996 V at x = 1. The observed Qdis is lower than the calculated Qtheo over the whole x range. Consequently, W gradually increases from 480 mW h·g–1 at x = 0, then reaches the maximum (=627 mW h·g–1) at x = 0.5, and finally decreases
to 516 mW h·g–1 at x = 1.
The maximum W value for x = 0.5
is slightly greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 (=607 mW h·g–1), and as far
as we are concerned, the x-dependence of W in LCMO has been clarified for the first time because
previous studies on LCMO were focused on the Qdis values.7−16

discharge curve, and (c) energy density (W) obtained
by Qdis × Eave. The solid line indicates the Qtheo for LCMO calculated by (148.23 – 3.21x)
mA h·g–1. The results for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 with the P4332 space group are taken from ref (5).

2.3 Crystal Structure
In this section,
we examined the crystal structures before and after the charge reaction
to understand the electrochemical reaction scheme of LCMO. Figure 4 shows the results for the Rietveld analyses for the pristine
(a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x = 1 samples. The crystal structure for x = 0 is assigned as a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, in which Li+ and
Mn3+/Mn4+ ions occupy tetrahedral 8a and octahedral
16d sites, respectively. Structural parameters, such as the cubic
lattice parameter ac [=8.2225(1) Å]
and oxygen positional parameter u [=0.264(1)], are
consistent with the previous results for LiMn2O4 (Table 1).19−21

Figure 4 Results
of the Rietveld analyses for the pristine LiCoxMn2–xO4 samples
with (a) x = 0, (b) x =
0.5, and (c) x = 1. Enlarged XRD patterns are also
shown in the insets to clarify the presence of the Li2MnO3 phase (indicated by *). The 220 diffraction in x = 1 indicates the presence of Co ions at the tetrahedral 8a site.

Before describing the result for x = 0.5, we wish
to mention the result for x = 1. The majority of
the x = 1 sample is in the Fd3̅m space group, as in the case for x = 0.
However, as seen in the inset of Figure 4c, the diffraction lines indicated by * are
clearly observed in the vicinity of the diffraction line around 2θ
= 10° (the 111 diffraction line of the spinel structure). These
diffraction lines originate from the Li2MnO3 phase with the monoclinic structure, whose weight fraction is determined
to be 6.23%. Coexistence of the Li2MnO3 phase
is also reported in previous structural analyses on x = 1.9 Moreover, the intensity of the
220 diffraction line at around 2θ = 17° is slightly larger
than that for x = 0 [compare Figure 4a,c], indicating that a small amount of metal
(Co) ions exists in the tetrahedral 8a site. As a result, the crystal
structure for the x = 1 sample is assigned as a mixture
of the spinel phase with the Fd3̅m space group and the Li2MnO3 impurity with
the C2/m space group. Because the
amount of Co ions at the 8a site is determined to be 0.113(1), the
actual formula for x = 1 can be represented as Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4. Note that the mixture
of 93.77 wt % Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 and 6.23 wt % Li2MnO3 is consistent with the
Li/Co/Mn (=1/1/1) composition of the starting material: mol % of Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 and Li2MnO3 are calculated to be 89.3 and 10.7, respectively,
providing the composition of Li/Co/Mn = 1.01/0.99/1.00.

The
Li2MnO3 impurity is not observed in the x = 0.5 sample [see Figure 4b]. The crystal structure for x =
0.5 is thus assigned as the single-phase of the spinel structure with
the Fd3̅m space group. Figure S3 shows the results for the Rietveld
analyses for the pristine (a) x = 0.25 and (b) x = 0.75 samples. The situation for x =
0.25 is similar to that for x = 0.5; the sample crystallized
into a single-phase of the spinel structure. By contrast, the Li2MnO3 impurity was observed in the XRD pattern for
the x = 0.75 sample [see diffraction lines indicated
by * in Figure S3b]. The weight fraction
of the Li2MnO3 phase in x =
0.75 is determined to be 1.67%, and the actual formula for x = 0.75 can be represented as Li0.970Co0.030[CoMn]O4. As seen from Figure S4, the amount of the Li2MnO3 phase in LCMO rapidly increases at x ≥ 0.75.

We next examined the distributions of the Li2MnO3 phase in the x = 1 sample by Raman spectroscopy. Figure S5 shows the Raman spectra for the LCMO
samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. According to
a factor group analysis,22 five Raman active
modes of A1g + Eg + 3F2g are predicted
for the spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group. The Raman spectrum for x = 0 shows a major Raman band at around 623 cm–1 and three minor Raman bands at 572, 477, and 365 cm–1. The major Raman band is assigned as the A1g mode, which
corresponds to a symmetric vibration between Mn3+/Mn4+ and O2– ions.16,23 The major Raman band at around 623 cm–1 splits
into two or three Raman bands with x, probably due
to the change in the proportion of Mn3+/Mn4+ ions.16 As seen in Figure 5a, the x = 1 sample indicates
three major Raman bands at around 652, 575, and 538 cm–1 and three minor Raman bands at around 475, 382, and 179 cm–1. Although these Raman bands are still unassigned, the Raman spectrum
for x = 1 significantly differs from that for the
single-phase of Li2MnO3 [Figure 5b]. This enables the LiCoMnO4 sample
to be distinguished into Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 and Li2MnO3 phases. As provided in Figure 5c, the Li2MnO3 phase segregates from the Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 phase, not coexisting in the Li0.887Co0.113[CoMn]O4 phase.

Raman mapping for the x = 1 sample in the region

Figure 6 shows the results
of the Rietveld analyses for the
fully charged LCMO samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.5, and (c) x =1. Figure S6 shows the results of the fully charged LCMO samples
with (a) x = 0.25 and (b) x = 0.75.
Here “fully” means the lithium cells were charged up
to 5.4 V before the XRD measurements. The y values
were calculated to be y = 0.15 for x = 0, y ≈ 0 for x = 0.25, y ≈ 0 for x = 0.5, y = 0.08 for x = 0.75, and y = 0.228
for x = 1, by ignoring the capacities consumed for
electrolyte decompositions. As seen from Figures 6 and S6, all LCMO
samples maintain a spinel structure with the Fd3̅m space group, as in the cases for the initial (pristine)
state. Structural parameters, such as ac and u, are summarized in Table 2.

up to 5.4 V. Enlarged XRD patterns are also shown in the insets to
clarify the presence of the Li2MnO3 phase (indicated

presence of Co ions at the tetrahedral 8a site.

2.4 Δac and
ΔV for LCMO
Figure 7a shows the ac values before and after the fully charged reaction as a function
of x in LiCoxMn2–xO4. The ac value before the charge reaction (pristine sample) monotonically
decreases from 8.2225(1) Å at x = 0 to 8.0589(1)
Å at x = 1. This linear decrease in ac agrees with the change in the ionic radius
(r) from Mn3+ ions with CN = 6 (rMn3+ = 0.58 Å) to Co3+ ions (rCo3+ = 0.55 Å)
with CN = 6, where CN is the coordination number.24 The ac value after the fully
charged reaction also indicates a linear decrease in ac with x, however, its slope (ac/x) is much smaller than that
for the LCMO samples before the charge reaction. That is, the ac value slightly decreases from 8.0581(1) Å
at x = 0 to 8.0083(1) Å at x = 1.

Figure 7 (a) Cubic lattice parameters (acs)
for the pristine LiCoxMn2–xO4 samples and fully charged LiyCoxMn2–xO4 samples. The solid line in (a) indicates
the calculated ac value from . (b) Change in Δac and change in the lattice volume (ΔV) during charge and discharge reactions as a function of x in LiCoxMn2–xO4. The ΔV value
for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 was calculated
from the data in ref (4).

Using these ac values for LCMO, the
change in ac (Δac) and the change in the lattice volume (ΔV) are determined. As seen in Figure 7b, both Δac and ΔV values decrease with increasing x; for instance, Δac =
−1.99% and ΔV = −5.88% for x = 0, Δac = −1.36%
and ΔV = −4.01% for x = 0.5, and Δac = −0.63%
and ΔV = −1.87% for x = 1. Here, the Δac and ΔV values for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4 are calculated to be −1.98 and −5.83%, respectively,
using the reported ac values before (=8.167
Å) and after (=8.005 Å) the fully charged reaction.4 Therefore, the Δac and ΔV values for x = 0.5 are smaller than those for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4, although the W value for x = 0.5 is greater than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4.

It should be noted that the Δac and ΔV values for x = 1
are significantly smaller compared with those for other positive electrode
materials, such as LiCoO2 (ΔV ≈
+2.5% at the half-charged state)25 and
LiFePO4 (ΔV ≈ −6.9%).26 The ΔV value of −1.87%
for x = 1 can be regarded as a “zero-strain”
lithium insertion material because one of the zero-strain lithium
insertion materials, Li[CrTi]O4, indicates a ΔV of +0.7%.27,28 Thus far, this statement has
not been explicitly expressed, although Alcántara et al.10 reported the change in ac for LiyCoMnO4.

Zero-strain lithium insertion materials such as Li[CrTi]O4 and Li[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4 (LTO)29−31 are used as negative electrode materials, whereas the x = 1 sample is used as a positive electrode material. XRD and Raman
spectroscopy clarified that the zero-strain reaction scheme of LTO
is achieved by a change in u on proceeding with the
discharge reaction, that is, local structural changes in the LiO6 and TiO6 environments.30,31 To compare with such a zero-strain reaction scheme, u values during various charge states were determined by the Rietveld
analyses for x = 1. As shown in Figure 8a, u for LiyCoMnO4 maintains a constant value
(∼0.263) up to the fully charged state, suggesting that the
zero-strain reaction scheme for x = 1 is different
from that for LTO. Considering the ac value
(∼8.00 Å) at the fully charged state, one can understand
the zero-strain reaction scheme for x = 1. That is,
the minimum ac value for face-centered
cubic (FCC) consisting of only O2– ions is calculated
to be ∼7.8 Å, using the relations  and rO2– = 1.38 Å (CN = 4) [see Figure 8b]. Hence, the zero-strain
character for x = 1 is achieved by a rigid framework
structure of O2– with FCC packing. In other words,
negative electrode materials with zero-strain are due to reversible
changes in the local structures, whereas positive electrode materials
with zero-strain are due to invariance in the local structures.

Figure 8 (a) Change
in the oxygen positional parameter (u) as a function
of y in LiyCoMnO4. (b) Schematics of zero-strain reaction scheme
for LiyCoMnO4. The ac value (≈8.0 Å) for LiyCoMnO4 is close to the minimum lattice
parameter () for the FCC consisting of O2– ions.

Finally, we wish to describe the strategy for positive
electrode
materials with more high-energy density. Although the x = 0.5 sample indicates the maximum W value among
the various spinel oxides, its W value is still lower
than layered oxides; for instance, layered oxides comprising Li/Ni/Mn/O2,32 exhibit more than 300 mA h·g–1 of Qdis and ∼3.5 V of Eave, resulting in more than 1000 mW h·g–1 of W. The present findings confirm that the redox
reaction of Co3+ ↔ Co4+ is effective
to increase Eave. Thus, layered oxides
comprising Li/Co/Mn/O would exhibit greater W values,
although the combination of Co and Mn ions in the layered structure
is reported to be thermodynamically unstable.33 Trials for preparing layered Li/Co/Mn/O oxides are underway in our
laboratory.

3 Conclusions
To pair
harmoniously with the high W value negative
electrode materials, explorations for positive electrode materials
with high W values have been performed in a series
of LCMO spinels with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The
maximum Qdis value for LCMO was exhibited
at x = 0.5, whereas Eave increased monotonically with x. Therefore, the
maximum W value (=627 mW h·g–1) was obtained at the x = 0.5 composition. The W value for x = 0.5 was slightly greater
than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4, which
has attracted much attention as a positive electrode material because
of its high W value. XRD measurements using synchrotron
radiation clarified another advantage for the x =
0.5 sample; that is, the ΔV value for x = 0.5 was about 2% smaller than that for Li[Ni1/2Mn3/2]O4. Thus, the x = 0.5
sample is regarded as a next-generation positive electrode material
with a high W value and a long cycle-life. Concerning
the ΔV values, the x = 1 sample
showed the minimum ΔV value (=–2%) among
the various positive electrode materials and can be thought of as
a zero-strain lithium insertion material, similar to LTO and Li[CrTi]O4. The zero-strain character for x = 1 is
due to the invariance in the local structures, which is different
from those for LTO and Li[CrTi]O4.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis and Characterization
Powder
samples of LCMO with x = 0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.75,
and 1 were prepared using a two-step solid-state reaction technique,
as reported previously,4,5,19 to
obtain highly crystallized LCMO samples. Regent grade LiOH·H2O (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), Co3O4 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.), and MnO2 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd.) were mixed with a pestle
and mortar and then pressed into a pellet of diameter 23 mm and thickness
∼5 mm. The pellet was first sintered at 900 °C for 12
h under flowing oxygen and then heated at 700 °C for 24 h, 600
°C for 24 h, and 500 °C for 48 h, successively, without
cooling to room temperature between each temperature step. The heating
and cooling rates were 200 and 60 °C·h–1, respectively. The effects of heating temperature were investigated
only for x = 1; we set the first sintering temperature
to 1000 °C or 1100 °C. A powder sample of Li2MnO3 was also synthesized. The reaction mixture of LiOH·H2O and MnO2 was heated at 900 °C for 12 h under
flowing oxygen.

The obtained LCMO samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 were characterized by powder XRD measurements
equipped with Fe Kα radiation (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS, Inc.),
SEM (S-3600N, Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Ltd.), and Raman spectroscopy
(NRS-3300, Jasco Co. Ltd.). XRD measurements were conducted in the
2θ range between 15 and 140° at a step-scan rate of 0.014°.
Raman spectroscopy was performed using an excitation wavelength of
532 nm, supplied by a diode-pumped solid-state laser. Before the measurements,
the sharp Raman shift of crystalline silicon was calibrated as 520
cm–1. The laser power and duration for taking one
Raman spectrum were 1 mW and 720 s, respectively. For the x = 1 sample, a two-dimensional mapping for the Raman spectra
was recorded using the excitation wavelength of 532 nm, to obtain
information about distributions of Li1−δCoδ[CoMn]O4 and Li2MnO3 phases (inVia Raman microscope, Renishaw plc.). Here, δ is
the amount of Co ions at the tetrahedral 8a (Li) site. The area for
the Raman mapping was 100 × 25 μm. The laser power and
duration for taking one spot of the Raman spectrum were 0.5 mW and
20 s, respectively.

4.2 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
properties for the LCMO samples were examined in a nonaqueous lithium
cell. The mixed electrode consisted of 88 wt % LCMO, 6 wt % conducting
carbon, and 6 wt % polyvinylidene binder, as reported previously.5,19 The surface area of the electrode was ∼2.00 cm2 (ϕ 16 mm). A stainless steel plate (ϕ 19 mm) was pressed
onto the lithium metal and used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte
was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) (EC/DMC = 3/7 by volume) solution (KISHIDA Chemical
Co. Ltd.). After fabricating the lithium cells in an argon-filled
glovebox, the cells were operated at a current of 0.6 mA (≈0.3
mA·cm–2) in the voltage range between 3.0 and
5.4 V. This applied current corresponds to ∼2 C rate. The temperature
for the electrochemical measurements was 25 °C.

4.3 Synchrotron Radiation Study
To clarify
changes in the crystal structures in the charged states, XRD measurements
were also performed at the synchrotron radiation facility, Aichi Synchrotron
Radiation Center. All of the charged LCMO samples were prepared using
electrochemical reactions and packed into borosilicate capillary tubes
with a diameter of 0.3 mm (W. Müller Glas Technik) in the argon-filled
glovebox. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2θ range between
5 and 95° using the two-dimensional detector (PILATUS 100 K,
DECTRIS Ltd.) of the BL5S2 beamline. The wavelength of X-ray was determined
to be 0.779547(3) Å from the XRD measurement of a silicon standard
(NIST 640d). Rietveld analyses were carried out using the RIETAN-FP
software,34 and the schematics of the crystal
structures were drawn by the VESTA software.35 The weight fraction, that is, the mol fraction of the LCMO and Li2MnO3 phases were determined by the multiphase mode
in the RIETAN-FP program.
