Using density functional theory calculations,
we demonstrate that
the electronic and optical properties of a buckled arsenene monolayer
can be tuned by molecular doping. Effective p-type doping of arsenene
can be realized by adsorption of tetracyanoethylene and tetracyanoquinodimethane
(TCNQ) molecules, while n-doped arsenene can be obtained by adsorption
of tetrathiafulvalene molecules. Moreover, owing to the charge redistribution,
a dipole moment is formed between each organic molecule and arsenene,
and this dipole moment can significantly tune the work function of
arsenene to values within a wide range of 3.99–5.57 eV. Adsorption
of TCNQ molecules on pristine arsenene can significantly improve the
latter’s optical absorption in a broad (visible to near-infrared)
spectral range. According to the AM 1.5 solar spectrum, two-fold enhancement
is attained in the efficiency of solar-energy utilization, which can
lead to great opportunities for the use of TCNQ–arsenene in
renewable energy. Our work clearly demonstrates the key role of molecular
doping in the application of arsenene in electronic and optoelectronic
components, renewable energy, and laser protection.

Introduction
Phosphorene, a monolayer
composed of puckered structures of phosphorus
atoms, has attracted much attention in recent years owing to its remarkable
electronic,1,2 thermal,3−5 mechanical,6 and optical7 properties.
Its great potential in nanoelectronics,8−10 spintronics,11 sensors,12 and energy
conversion and storage13−15 has been addressed. The fascinating properties and
wide application of phosphorene have driven the search for monolayers
of other group V elements. Recently, Zhang et al.16 predicted a new two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting material
named buckled arsenene. It is an intrinsic semiconductor with a sizable
band gap16−20 and ultrahigh mobility.19,20 Its band gap (larger
than 2 eV) makes it useful for transistors with a high on/off current
ratio and optoelectronic devices working under blue or ultraviolet
light.16 Moreover, its stability has been
demonstrated by calculations of its phonon spectrum16−19 and ab initio molecular dynamics
calculations.18 Very recently, Tsai et
al.21 successfully synthesized multilayered
arsenene nanoribbons on InAs substrates by using a plasma-assisted
process. All these investigations indicate that buckled arsenene can
be a promising 2D semiconducting material in various fields.

Owing to the atomic thickness and large surface-to-volume ratio
of 2D materials, molecular doping has been widely adopted to enhance
their conductivity, reduce their carrier-injection barrier, and control
their band gap to promote their application in electronics. For example,
graphene is regarded as an ideal material for hosting the molecules.22−33 By adsorbing various types of organic molecules on graphene, the
type and density of charge carriers can be controlled, which is vital
for different practical applications. Solís-Fernández
et al.28 found that the doping of graphene
can be varied from p- to n-type by gradually increasing the concentration
of piperidine. Thus, p–n junctions can be formed on a graphene
sheet by controlling the coverage of organic molecules. Recently,
the interaction between organic molecules and 2D semiconducting materials
such as MoS234−38 and black phosphorene39,40 has also been the subject
of many studies. These works showed that molecular doping not only
changes the electronic properties of 2D materials, but also modifies
their optical34−37 and thermoelectric38 properties. For
instance, Mouri et al.34 found that the
photoluminescence intensity of MoS2 can be remarkably improved
by chemical doping with p-type molecules.

On the basis of these
developments, we expect molecular doping
to be a powerful tool for tuning the electronic and optical properties
of buckled arsenene. In principle, an arsenic atom in buckled arsenene
forms three σ-bonds with neighboring arsenic atoms and leaves
a lone pair of electrons. A previous study indicated that such lone
pairs of electrons can enhance the surface interaction between black
phosphorene and dopant molecules.41 Therefore,
buckled arsenene is expected to be highly suitable for hosting organic
molecules owing to the presence of lone pairs of electrons. However,
the effects of molecular doping on the electronic and optical properties
of buckled arsenene are still not well understood.

In this paper,
we investigated the impact of molecular doping on
the electronic and optical properties of buckled arsenene by performing
first-principles calculations. We considered three representative
organic molecules—tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), tetracyanoquinodimethane
(TCNQ), and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), which have been extensively
investigated in organic chemistry and widely used in fabrication of
electronic devices.42−47 We found that surface doping of arsenene with organic TCNE and TCNQ
can lead to effective p-doping. Meanwhile, n-doped arsenene can be
obtained by adsorption of TTF. For the TCNE-doping of arsenene, because
the acceptor level of TCNE is just 0.082 eV above the valance band
edge of arsenene, room temperature was sufficient to thermally ionize
the surface dopants. We also found that beyond enhancing the electronic
properties, TCNQ doubled the optical absorption ability of arsenene
in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The effective doping
and enhancement of optical absorption are expected to result in good
performance of TCNQ–arsenene in both nanoelectronics and solar-energy
harvesting.

Results and Discussion
Adsorption Configurations
For each
molecule, we considered
several adsorption configurations. To compare their stability, we
calculated their adsorption energy (Ead) on arsenene as follows 1  where Emolecule, Earsenene, and Emolecule+arsenene represent the energies of the dopant molecule,
pristine arsenene, and molecule-doped arsenene, respectively.

We first explored the adsorption of each molecule on arsenene by
identifying the most energetically favorable configurations. Various
high symmetry adsorption sites for these molecules are summarized
in Figure S1, and the most favorable adsorption
configurations are shown in Figure 1. Adsorption on other sites is characterized by lower
adsorption energy. Hereafter, all of the results and discussions are
related to the most energetically favorable configurations. For the
TCNE molecule, all the cyano groups align parallel to the armchair
direction of arsenene, with an Ead of
0.54 eV and an adsorption height (h) of 3.23 Å.
For the TCNQ molecule, the benzene ring is located right above an
arsenic atom in the upper plane, allowing high doping efficiency and
a rather stable structure (Ead = 0.84
eV; h = 3.31 Å). For the TTF molecule, the two
C3S2 rings are also located above the arsenic
atoms of arsenene. In addition, the TTF molecule bends over the arsenene
sheet, resulting in an Ead of 0.84 eV
and an h of 3.08 Å.

the most stable configurations of TCNE, TCNQ,
and TTF molecules adsorbed on buckled arsenene. The orange and blue
sticks represent the As atoms in the upper and lower planes, respectively,
of arsenene. The black, red, yellow, and white spheres represent C,
N, S, and H atoms, respectively.

Effects of Doping on the Electronic Structure of Arsenene
Figure 2a–c
shows the isosurface of charge-density difference after the adsorption
of TCNE, TCNQ, and TTF on the arsenene monolayer, respectively. The
pink and white regions denote the accumulation and depletion of electrons,
respectively. For the systems with adsorbed TCNE and TCNQ, the electrons
are transferred from the arsenene layer to the molecules, and both
the TCNE and TCNQ molecules act as electron acceptors, primarily owing
to their high adiabatic electron affinity (2.884 eV for TCNE48 and 2.80 eV for TCNQ49). The electrons donated by the arsenene layer are mainly located
in the cyano groups of the molecules and the interlayer region between
the molecules and arsenene sheet, suggesting that the cyano groups
are the electron-accepting groups. For the TTF–arsenene adsorption
system, the white regions around the TTF molecule indicate that it
acts as an electron donor because of its low ionization potential
of 6.83 eV.50 The transferred electrons
are mainly distributed in arsenic atoms in the contact region of the
arsenene host layer. The more accurate Bader analysis51−53 clearly shows that 0.22, 0.20, and −0.03 electrons are transferred
from the arsenene layer to TCNE, TCNQ, and TTF molecules, respectively.
Therefore, the adsorption of one organic molecule (density is 1.11
× 1014 cm–2) induces carrier injection
in arsenene with concentrations of 2.44 × 1013, 2.22
× 1013, and 3.33 × 1012 cm–2, respectively, which can significantly enhance the performance of
arsenene in nanoelectronics. In practical application, the carrier
concentration will change with adsorption density. Moreover, owing
to the charge redistribution, a dipole moment forms between the organic
molecule and arsenene, and it can significantly change the work function
of arsenene. As shown in Figure 2d, the adsorption of acceptor molecules (TCNE or TCNQ)
results in an increase in the work function: the work functions of
TCNE–arsenene and TCNQ–arsenene are 5.57 and 5.40 eV,
respectively. In contrast, the donor molecules (TTF) lead to a considerable
reduction in the work function from that of pristine arsenene (5.16
eV) to TTF–arsenene (3.99 eV). This large tunable range of
work function from 3.99 to 5.57 eV suggests the great potential of
molecular doping in arsenene-based nanoelectronics. It is worth mentioning
that the charge transfer is much smaller for the TTF–arsenene
systems, while the change in work function is much larger than that
in the TCNE–arsenene and TCNQ–arsenene systems. Actually,
the relationship between change of work function and the charge transfer
is not linear in most situations. This is because the change of work
function not only depends on the shift of the Fermi level but also
depends on the dipole moment, and the relationship between these two
items and the charge transfer are nonlinear. (Please refer to the Supporting Information).

respectively. The pink and white regions denote the accumulation and

arsenene, TCNE–arsenene, TCNQ–arsenene, and TTF–arsenene

Work function is one of the critical
properties that must be evaluated
for the application of 2D materials in electronic devices. It is well-known
that materials with low work function can potentially be applied in
field-emission devices. Several strategies were employed in previous
studies to decrease the work function of nanomaterials. For example,
the work function of boron-doped carbon nanotubes was found to be
1.7 eV lower than that of pristine carbon nanotubes.54 The adsorption of alkali metals on carbon nanotubes55 and graphene56 was
also found to significantly lower their work functions. In our study,
by adsorbing the TTF molecule on the surface of buckled arsenene,
the work function can be decreased by up to 1.17 eV. Moreover, this
method has the advantage of not requiring the production of vacancies
in the host to anchor the impurities and also avoiding the issue of
clustering of alkali metal atoms. All in all, this is a feasible and
controllable method for reducing the work function of arsenene.

To assess the effect of molecular doping on the electronic properties
of arsenene, we calculated the projected band structure of pristine
arsenene and the TCNE–arsenene, TCNQ–arsenene, and TTF–arsenene
adsorption systems; the calculated structures are shown in Figure 3. It can be clearly
seen that pristine arsenene is an indirect semiconductor with a band
gap of 1.59 eV (Figure 3a), which is in good agreement with a previously reported result.17 Compared with pristine arsenene, a flat band,
which is dominated by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
of organic molecules, appears near the Fermi level in the TCNE–arsenene
and TCNQ–arsenene systems (Figure 3b,c). The impurity bands are 0.041 and 0.077
eV above the Fermi level, representing the formation of acceptor states.
These empty levels could accept excited electrons and produce holes
in the arsenene sheet, signifying p-type doping of arsenene. For the
TTF–arsenene system, we found a flat band induced by the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the TTF molecule at 0.061 eV
below the Fermi level, which suggests that donor states are formed.
As a result, the adsorption of TTF on arsenene results in n-type doping
behavior. Beyond the new doping level, the main features of the band
structure are not changed, and the stability of arsenene remains intact
without structural breakage.

(c) TCNQ–arsenene, and (d) TTF–arsenene systems. The
black and red symbols represent the contribution of the arsenene layer
and organic molecules, respectively. The Fermi level was set to zero
and is indicated by the black dashed line.

To gain deeper insight into the electronic properties of
arsenene
systems with adsorbed organic molecules, we calculated the partial
charge densities of the impurity band for the TCNE–arsenene,
TCNQ–arsenene, and TTF–arsenene systems; the results
are shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that the impurity band of all the adsorbed systems
is dominated by the organic molecules. For TCNE and TCNQ, the profiles
of the partial charge densities are similar to those of their respective
LUMO (Figure S2a,b). Meanwhile, for TTF,
the profile of the partial charge density is quite like that of its
HOMO (Figure S2c). Therefore, the excited
electrons and holes are spatially separated, which leads to good characteristics
for optoelectronic applications.

respectively. The isosurface value was set to 0.002 e Å–3.

Semiconductor p–n junctions
are essential building blocks
of today’s electronic and optoelectronic devices. With the
rapid development of 2D materials, they are now considered as promising
material candidates for post-silicon electronics. Recently, 2D-material-based
p–n junctions have attracted wide interest because of their
great potential in various applications such as solar cells,57,58 diodes,59,60 and photodetectors.61 To construct p–n junctions, the key is to precisely control
the type of charge carriers in 2D materials as either p-type or n-type.
In this work, the doping gaps for TCNE–, TCNQ–, and
TTF–arsenene systems are 0.082, 0.147, and 0.655 eV, respectively.
Thus, both the TCNE and TCNQ molecules can introduce shallow acceptor
states in the band gap of arsenene close to the valence band edge,
while the deep donor states can be introduced in the band gap after
the adsorption of the TTF molecule. The DFT calculation results show
that the doping gap of TCNE–arsenene is close to the thermal
active energy (kBT =
0.026 eV at 300 K), which suggests that the thermal ionization of
surface dopants can happen near room temperature. Moreover, the doping
gap and doping concentration can be further controlled by applying
an out-of-plane electric field and in-plane strain.39 Thus, the carrier type in arsenene can be effectively tuned
to p-type or n-type by molecular doping, which can be used to construct
arsenene p–n junctions, as revealed recently by Gao et al.62

Effect of Molecular Doping on Optical Absorption
Next,
we investigated the effect of molecular doping on the optical properties
of arsenene. As a benchmark, we calculated the imaginary parts of
the dielectric functions for a pristine TCNQ molecule by using both
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and HSE06 functionals,
as shown in Figure S3. We selected the
diagonal parts (εxx2)
as an example. The PBE and HSE06 methods each predicted a high adsorption
peak at approximately 878 and 615 nm, respectively. The results predicted
by the HSE06 method are in good agreement with the available experimental
data (about 580–650 nm with different cations).63 Hereafter, all the presented results were calculated
using the HSE06 method. Figure 5 shows the computed results of the imaginary parts of the
dielectric functions for pristine arsenene and the adsorption systems.
For pristine arsenene, many absorption peaks can be found in the ultraviolet
region (<400 nm), but much weaker absorption is seen in the visible
region (400–700 nm), which are consistent with previous results.64,65 For the TCNE–arsenene and TTF–arsenene systems, the
imaginary parts of their dielectric functions are rather similar to
that of the dielectric function of pristine arsenene. Interestingly,
for TCNQ–arsenene, two peaks appear in the visible region,
revealing high optical absorption as a consequence of molecular doping.
Although the charge transfer is similar, the band alignment of TCNE–arsenene
(Figure 3b) and TCNQ–arsenene
(Figure 3c) is different
because the difference in the initial position of LUMO of TCNE/TCNQ.
As a result, the optical absorption of TCNE–arsenene and TCNQ–arsenene
is different.

Figure 5 Imaginary parts of dielectric functions of pristine arsenene
and
TCNE–arsenene, TCNQ–arsenene, and TTF–arsenene
systems calculated by HSE06 functional.

Figure 6 shows
the
optical absorption spectra of the pristine arsenene and TCNQ–arsenene
systems. The absorption coefficient was obtained from the following
equation66 2  where ε12(ω)
and ε22(ω) are the real and imaginary
parts, respectively, of the dielectric constant. For pristine arsenene,
many absorption peaks with intensity above 1.0 × 105 cm–1 can be found in the ultraviolet region. According
to the AM 1.5 solar spectrum,67 visible
and near-infrared radiation accounts for most of the solar energy
arriving at the surface of the earth. Therefore, a frequently employed
strategy to obtain high-efficiency photovoltaic devices is to increase
the optical absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions. Obviously,
pristine arsenene is not a promising candidate for photovoltaics because
of its poor absorption ability in the visible and near-infrared regions.
Here, we propose that the adsorption of TCNQ molecule is a feasible
approach to enhance the optical-absorption ability of arsenene in
the major range of the solar spectrum. The absorption peaks in the
ultraviolet region are reduced slightly after the adsorption of TCNQ
(Figure 6), and a new
absorption peak with an intensity of about 1.90 × 104 cm–1 can be found at approximately 610 nm in the
visible region. In addition, the absorption spectrum of TCNQ–arsenene
is much broader (in a wide range from the ultraviolet region to the
near-infrared region) than that of pristine arsenene. In fact, the
optical absorption spectrum of TCNQ–arsenene almost overlaps
the entire incident solar spectrum, thus suggesting that this adsorption
system is a highly efficient absorber of light in the visible and
near-infrared range. We can quantitatively estimate the solar absorption
ability (η) of a material from the following equation 3  where λ is the wavelength of the incident
light, a(λ) is the absorption spectrum, and S(λ) is the incident AM 1.5G solar flux. The η
of TCNQ–arsenene is 27.97 W/cm3, which is about
twice that of pristine arsenene (14.24 W/cm3). Thus, it
can be concluded that the TCNQ–arsenene system is a high-efficiency
light-absorbing material, which is promising for application in devices
for harvesting of solar energy.

Figure 6 Optical-absorption coefficient of pristine
arsenene and TCNQ–arsenene
systems calculated by HSE06 functional. The range of light absorption
by TCNQ–arsenene system overlaps the whole wavelength range
of the incident AM 1.5G solar flux.

Laser technology has been widely used in both military and
civilian
applications. For example, a YAG laser (wavelength: 1064 nm) is used
in many important applications such as material cutting68 and drug delivery.69 However, an earlier investigation showed that the picosecond pulses
of Nd:YAG laser irradiation can cause ocular damage.70 The protection of humans from unwanted laser irradiation
is thus very important for wide adoption of laser technology, and
the search for materials that can protect them from unwanted incident
laser beams is obviously the key. Pristine arsenene can be used as
a protective material for laser irradiation at wavelengths below about
500 nm. On the other hand, TCNQ–arsenene offers protection
from laser beams in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions.
Moreover, the absorption intensity of TCNQ–arsenene is stronger
than that of pristine arsenene. For example, the TCNQ–arsenene
system’s absorption intensity of laser irradiation from a YAG
laser source is about eight times stronger than that of pristine arsenene.
Thus, TCNQ–arsenene is also a promising protective material
against unwanted laser irradiation.

Conclusions
We
performed density functional theory calculations to study the
effects of molecular doping on the electronic and optical properties
of buckled arsenene. TCNE and TCNQ were found to be efficient p-type
dopants, while TTF was found to be an n-type dopant. Our results indicate
that arsenene-based p–n junctions can be manufactured by doping
arsenene with these organic molecules. In addition, the adsorption
of the TTF molecule can significantly reduce the work function of
arsenene. Interestingly, the ability of arsenene to absorb solar energy
is doubled owing to the adsorption of TCNQ molecules on its surface.
Therefore, the TCNQ–arsenene system is a promising material
for application in solar-energy harvesting. Our work provides a molecular-level
mechanism for tuning the electronic and optical properties of arsenene
and unveils its potential for application in nanoelectronics and optoelectronic
devices.

Computational Details
First-principles calculations
were performed by using the plane-wave-based
Vienna ab initio simulation package.71 The
interactions between the ions and valence electrons were treated by
the projected augmented-wave method.72 We
used the generalized gradient approximation with the PBE form for
the exchange–correlation functional.73 Because the PBE functional is less reliable in describing the optical
properties of semiconductors, the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06) functional74 was also selected
to compute the optical properties. The zero-damping vdW-D3 correction
proposed by Grimme75 was used to describe
the long-range interaction between organic molecules and the arsenene
layer. The kinetic-energy cutoff of 400 eV and 7 × 7 × 1
Monkhorst–Pack76k-point meshes were used. We adopted a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell
containing 32 As atoms to mimic the adsorption of organic molecules
on the arsenene monolayer. Moreover, to avoid interactions between
periodic structures, a large vacuum region of 20 Å was adopted.
The geometry was optimized until the total energy converged to 10–5 eV and the forces of all atoms are smaller than 0.01
eV/Å.
