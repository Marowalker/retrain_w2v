A solvothermal reaction
of Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and 5-mercapto-1-methyl-tetrazole
(Hmmtz) in methanol (MeOH)
yielded a one-dimensional solvent-free energetic coordination polymer,
namely, [Co(mmtz)2]n1, which was structurally characterized. The enthalpy of formation
(ΔfH°) of 1 (907
kJ mol–1) is much larger than that of commercial
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (−59 kJ mol–1). The
impact sensitivity and the friction sensitivity are greater than 40
J and 360 N, respectively, indicating that compound 1 exhibits a potential application as a safe explosive. Temperature-dependent
molar magnetic susceptibilities show that weak antiferromagnetic behavior
exists in 1.

Introduction
Energetic materials
(EMs) are compounds or mixtures that react
sustainably and release a large amount of energy within a short time
period, including explosives, gunpowder, and pyrotechnic agents.1−3 Traditional EMs like 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
(RDX), and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazacyclooctane (HMX) are
commonly used for military and commercial blasting.4 However, the most prominent problem of traditional EMs
is high sensitivity toward friction and shock, which creates serious
safety hazard for storage, transportation, and usage.5,6 The ideal high-performance EMs should have appropriate sensitivity
to external stimuli.7,8 Some strategies to reduce the
sensitivity and improve the energetic performance have been recently
proposed, such as co-crystallization and energetic salts.9−12 Another straightforward and efficient method to develop next-generation
EMs is to form the energetic coordination polymers (ECPs) through
self-assembly. Metal centers and highly energetic ligands with strong
coordination bonds can construct closely packed structures, which
can markedly improve the structural stability of ECPs as promising
candidates for safe EMs.13−15 Rational structural design of
ECPs has been proved to be an effective way to obtain highly energetic
and low-sensitive EMs.7,16−18 For example,
Hope-Weeks et al. reported two one-dimensional (1D) materials, namely,
[M(N2H4)5(ClO4)2]n (M = Co and Ni), with excellent detonation
properties and high sensitivity.19 A few
metal-based high-energy materials with excellent explosive properties
have been presented, but the sensitivity is too high to satisfy commercial
applications. To acquire less sensitive CPs, two two-dimensional (2D)
materials, [Zn2(N2H4)3(N2H3CO2)2(ClO4)2·H2O]n (ZnHHP)
and [Co2(N2H4)4(N2H3CO2)2(ClO4)2·H2O]n (CHHP),
were synthesized.20 The results show that
the sensitivity have significantly been reduced through ligand modification.
Afterward, Pang et al. first designed two three-dimensional (3D) 4,4′-azo-1,2,4-triazole-based
coordination polymers [Ag(atrz)1.5(NO3)]n and [Cu(atrz)3(NO3)2]n with excellent thermal
stability, high heats of detonation, and less sensitivity.21 These reported results indicate that coordination
polymers, rationally designed with different structural dimensionalities,
can serve as new-generation energetic material candidates. The design
strategies of ECPs are focused on the diverse structural types realized
by strong coordination bonds between the metal centers and the ligands.22−24 On the other hand, intermolecular interaction in EMs, such as π–π
stacking, which can effectively buffer against mechanical stimulation
to decrease the sensitivity, is also an effective way to improve the
stability of EMs.25,26 Additionally, highly energetic
covalent bonds of the ligand can offer the primary energetic source
to enhance energetic performances of ECPs.1,21,27

In this study, a 1D solvent-free ECP
[Co(mmtz)2]n1 was obtained by the solvothermal
method (Scheme 1).
The constant-volume combustion heat, thermogravimetric analysis-differential
scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) curves, and sensitivities of 1 were measured. The values of ΔfH° (907 kJ mol–1), thermal stability
(304 °C), the impact sensitivity (IS > 40 J), and the friction
sensitivity (FS > 360 N) demonstrate that compound 1 can
serve as a potential energetic material. Magnetic materials are considered
as a class of dangerous goods in air transport. Due to the existence
of Co(II) ions with d7 electronic configuration and unpaired
electrons, the magnetic properties of 1 have also been
investigated to ensure the safety of its use, storage, and transportation.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1
Results
and Discussion
Crystal Structure [Co(mmtz)2]n1
Compound 1 belongs to
the monoclinic C2/c space group.
Each asymmetric unit of 1 is made up of one unique Co(II)
atom and two deprotonated mmtz– ligands (Figure 1a). The Co(II) atom
adopted a four-coordinated pattern by two N atoms (N4 and N8) and
two S atoms (S1#1 and S2#2) from four different deprotonated mmtz– ligands to form a distorted tetrahedral geometry.
As depicted in Figure 1b, each deprotonated mmtz– group exhibits a μ2 – κS1:κN4 bridge coordination mode to
connect the adjacent Co(II) atoms to generate a 1D linear chain along
the a-axis with Co···Co alternate
distances of 4.040(3) and 3.908(4) Å, respectively. The distance
between two adjacent tetrazole centroids is 3.242(3) Å (Table S1, Supporting Information), which is typical
for π–π interactions (<4.00 Å). The coordination
bond distances of Co–N and Co–S are in the acceptable
ranges of 1.993(5)–2.015(5) and 2.302(2)–2.303(3) Å,
respectively, with the S/N–Co–S/N angles varying from
101.35(8) to 116.87(16)° (Table S2, Supporting Information).

Thermal Stability
Thermal stability is one of the most
important properties of EMs. As shown in Figure 2a, a strong exothermic peak appeared at 304
°C in the DSC curve, which is well consistent with the weight
loss in the TGA curve. It is worth noting that the obvious overweight
peak can be observed at 304 °C in the TGA curve, which illustrates
the explosion occurring in 1. The degradation temperature
(Td) of 1 (304 °C) is
179 °C higher than that of the ligand Hmmtz (Td = 125 °C, Figure 2b). The improved thermal stability of 1 is attributed to the strong coordination bonds and π–π
interactions, which prompts to construct a tightly packed 1D architecture
with structural reinforcements to meet the fundamental criterions
for practical applications.14,29,30

Energetic Properties
The enthalpy of formation (ΔfH°) is a crucial parameter to assess
the performance of ECPs. The constant-volume combustion heat (Qv) measurement of 1 was carried
out, and the test value of Qv is 14.438
kJ g–1. According to gas volume correction: ΔcH = Qv + ΔnRT (Δn is determined by the change
in the number of gas constituents before and after the reaction, T = 298.15 K and R = 8.314 J mol–1 K–1) and the ideal combustion reaction eq 1, the enthalpy of combustion
(ΔcH), can be calculated. The ideal
combustion reaction equation is given as follows 1   2  The ΔcH value
of 1 was calculated as −14.421 kJ g–1. According to eq 2,
the ΔfH° value of 1 can be deduced using Hess’s law and inferred as 907 kJ mol–1 at 101.325 kPa and 298.15 K, with the known enthalpies
of CoO (s, −237.9 kJ mol–1), H2O (l, −285.83 kJ mol–1), CO2 (g,
−393.51 kJ mol–1), and SO2 (g,
−296.8 kJ mol–1). Compound 1 has a high nitrogen content leading to the relatively high positive
ΔfH°. Compared to that of the
commercial TNT (−59 kJ mol–1), the ΔfH° value of 1 is higher.
In addition, compared to other reported ECPs like Co-BTA15 ([Co9(BTA)10(HBTA)2(H2O)10]n, H2BTA = N,N-bis(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)-amine), Cd-BTA31 ([Cd(BTA)(H2O)]n, and Cu-DNS1 (Cu2(DNS)(tetrazole)(H2O), H2DNS = 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid) (Table 1), the ΔfH° value of 1 has obvious advantages.

Sensitivity Test
The impact and friction sensitivity
test is an indispensable measurement of EMs for the risk assessment.
The experimental data of 1 as well as those of the commercial
explosive TNT and some selected ECPs were also given for comparison
in Table 1. For compound 1, the experimental value of IS is greater than 40 J and FS
is larger than 360 N. Compound 1 possesses low impact
and friction sensitivity, showing that 1 has an excellent
mechanical stability than TNT and the selected ECPs, such as Co-BTA15 (IS = 27 J, FS > 360 N). These results denoted
that compound 1 is an insensitive energetic material
in accordance with the U.N. Standard.32 The introduction of electron-donating substituents like methyl (−CH3), hydroxyl (−OH), or sulfhydryl (−SH) can also
reduce the sensitivity of compounds.33 The
good thermal stability, low mechanical sensitivity, and high ΔfH° value of 1 promote that
compound 1 can act as a potential replacement of traditional
EMs.

Magnetic Properties
The temperature-dependent molar
magnetic susceptibilities were obtained in an external field of 1 kOe at temperatures ranging from 2 to 300 K. The plots of
χM–1 and χMT vs T for 1 are shown in Figure 3. The measured χMT value is 2.26 emu K mol–1, which is slightly higher than that of the theoretical value of
a magnetic isolated Co(II) (1.875 emu K mol–1, g = 2.00 and S = 3/2) at 300 K because
of the orbital contribution of Co(II) in a tetrahedral surrounding.34 The χMT values
reduce gradually to 1.90 emu K mol–1 at 100 K when
the temperature decreases and then reduces rapidly to 0.078 em mol–1 K–1 at 2 K. The results indicate
that compound 1 has antiferromagnetic interactions. The
magnetic susceptibility within 70–300 K was fitted well to
the Curie–Weiss law χM = C/(T – θ) with C =
2.516(1) emu mol–1 K–1 and θ
= – 29.985(0) K. The effective magnetic moment (μeff = (8C)1/2 μB) per Co2+ ion in 1 is 4.5 μB, which approached the value of 5.1 μB for a free
Co(II) ion.35 The negative Weiss constant
also denotes the antiferromagnetic interactions in 1 (the
distance between the nearest Co2+ ions is 3.908(4) Å).
The measured field-dependent isothermal magnetization curve at 10
K shows that the magnetization decreases almost linearly at an external
field ranging from 80 to 0 kOe (Figure S1, Supporting Information). When the magnetic field H = 0, the magnetization value of 1 is zero, which indicates
that compound 1 does not generate magnetism without the
external magnetic field. The magnetic influence of 1 on
the electronic instrument signals of transport vehicles can be neglected.

law within 70–300 K.

Conclusions
In summary, a new nitrogen-rich Co(II) coordination
polymer 1 was successfully obtained and structurally
characterized.
The energetic properties of 1 have been thoroughly investigated.
Compound 1 displays good thermal stability (Td = 304 °C), a high ΔfH° value (907 kJ mol–1), and low sensitivity
(IS > 40 J and FS > 360 N), which are superior to the traditional
TNT (Td = 295 °C, ΔfH° = −59 kJ mol–1,
IS = 15 J, FS > 353 N). In contrast to the ligand Hmmtz with the Td value of 125 °C, the thermal stability
of 1 remarkably increases through utilizing coordination
polymerization and π–π interactions. The temperature-dependent
molar magnetic susceptibilities show the existence of weak antiferromagnetic
interactions in 1. These results imply that compound 1 can act as a safe energetic material candidate. This work
can provide valuable references for the rational design of new safe
EMs.

Experimental Section
Safety Precautions
Caution! Hmmtz
and 1 are potential EMs. Dealing with these materials
requires appropriate
protective measures like safety glasses and leather gloves.

Materials
and Methods
All chemicals can be commercially
obtained and used without further purification. TGA and DSC data were
collected using a Mettler Toledo instrument under a N2 atmosphere
with 2.7 mg power of the samples heated in an Al2O3 crucible at a linear heating rate of 5 K min–1. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario EL III
microanalyzer. The Fourier transform infrared spectra were recorded
on a PerkinElmer Spectrum using KBr pellets. The temperature-dependent
molar magnetic susceptibilities were calculated on a Quantum Design
MPMS-XL SQUID magnetometer using crushed samples (in the powdered
form). IS and FS were measured on a BAM fall hammer BFH-12 and a BAM
friction apparatus FSKM-10, respectively, calibrated by manufacturers
using traditional energetic materials such as TNT, RDX, and HMX. Powdered
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex
600 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range
of 5° < 2θ < 65° at room temperature. The Mercury
software can produce the simulated patterns of compound 1.

Synthesis of [Co(mmtz)2]n1
A mixture of Hmmtz (174 mg, 1.5 mmol) and
Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (125 mg, 0.5
mmol) in MeOH (10 mL) was sealed into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave
after 15 min of ultrasonic treatment, then heated to 120 °C for
8 h, and kept for 3 days at 120 °C. Finally, it was cooled to
30 °C at a linear rate of 3 °C h–1. Dark
blue block crystals of 1 were formed (yield: 60%, based
on Co). Calcd for C4H6CoN8S2: C, 16.61; H, 2.08; N, 38.75%. Found: C, 16.52; H, 2.01; N, 38.59%.

s, 1310 m, 1182 m, 1086 w, 1032 w, 989 w, 831 w, 712 m (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The peak
of experimental PXRD pattern (Figure S3, Supporting Information) was in accordance with the simulation,
showing the pure phase of the as-synthesized 1.

X-ray
Crystallography
Diffraction data of 1 were measured
on a Rigaku PILATUS CCD diffractometer at 293 K using
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The intensity data
sets were measured on the ω-scan technique and found to decrease
on CrystalClear software. The direct methods were used to resolve
the structure and the subsequent successive difference Fourier yielded
in other nonhydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms were calculated and
added to the idealized positions. A full-matrix least-squares refinement
based on F2 refined the final structure.28Table 2 summarizes the relevant crystal data and structure refinement
results of 1.
