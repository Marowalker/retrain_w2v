The precise arrangement of metal
ions in type and number by a ligand
represents an important challenge in biology as well as in materials
science. The preorganization of different metal ions such as alkaline-earth
and transition-metal ions is of particular interest for the design
of catalysts or precursors of oxides. This study is based on a Ω-shaped
salen-derived ligand comprising N2O2 and O2O2 coordination sites. The selective binding of
Cu(II)
and Ni(II) and alkaline-earth-metal ions is influenced by many factors
such as the size of the cation, the solvent, or the counterion. UV–vis
and 1H NMR titrations and single-crystal X-ray structures
reveal that the obtained complexes tend to adopt different structures
in solution compared to the solid state. Mainly discrete motifs with
a stoichiometry 1:1 (LM1 to alkaline-earth-metal ions)
have been shown to form in the solid state, whereas in solution, the
2:1 complexes are predominant.

Introduction
The design and synthesis
of new mixed transition-metal and alkaline-earth-metal
complexes is of interest in many fields such as catalysis,1−3 material sciences,4−10 or biochemistry.11−14 Furthermore, their abundance, their affordability, and in most cases
their biocompatibility represent a real advantage. However, research
on alkaline-earth-metal materials represents a considerable challenge15 due to the lack of preferred geometrical coordination
and coordination numbers resulting from their large ionic radii and
electronic configuration.16−21

Interesting and enhanced properties for potential biological
or
physical applications can emanate from the combination and the complexation
of specific metal ions22−26 orderly placed in different compartments of one ligand entity, delivering
various intriguing structural architectures.27−33 For instance, aluminum–dipyrrin complexes able to selectively
bind alkaline-earth ions in an aqueous mixed solvent have been recently
synthesized and can be applied for colorimetric and/or fluorometric
sensing applications.34−37

Compartmentalized multimetallic compounds are also of particular
interest as precursors for the production of mixed metal oxides38−43 via the single-source precursor method.44,45 Although diketonates46−48 and ketoimines49,50 are the typical ligands
for binding alkaline-earth ions, a multitopic polyether-based ligand
with specific chelating sites has been designed, allowing the selective
coordination of Cu(II) in one site and Ba(II) or Ca(II) in a second
site.51 The obtained heterometallic complexes
were further thermally decomposed to stoichiometric mixed metal compounds.
The choice of a versatile organic ligand with specific coordination
sites is thus of crucial importance for the synthesis of such compounds.32,52

Since the past few years, several research groups have carried
out numerous studies on multi-metal-containing host–guest complexes
based on salen-type ligands.53,54,63−69,55−62 However, even though transition-metal ions have been widely used
in combination with salen-derived ligands for multiple purposes, systems
with alkaline-earth-metal ions were poorly investigated.52,70

In a previous work,71 we have explored
the heterometallic systems derived from a 3-methylsalicylaldehyde-diamine
ligand (H2L) containing two specific coordination sites.72,73 Its central coordination site was composed of an imine-based N2O2 entity coordinating either Cu(II) or Ni(II)
ions. The subsequent prearrangement of the ligand into a Ω-shape
generated a second recognition site, O2O2, composed
of two phenoxy and two methoxy groups able to coordinate hard alkali-metal
ions. Our copper- and nickel-based metalloligands (LCu or LNi), which
showed to be interesting chelate ligands for the uptake74 of large cations, led us to explore their structural
differences upon coordination to group 2 metal ions.

In this
research, we report the synthesis and the structural characterization
of eight new mixed metal complexes corresponding to the coordination
of the alkaline-earth series by LCu and LNi. Different coordination
modes can be expected in solution and/or in the solid state75,76 depending on the size of the metal ion coordinated at the O2O2 site. The structural studies of alkali complexes
described in our previous work, combined with the herein described
study of alkaline-earth compounds in both solution and the solid states,
constitute a great leap forward in the understanding of the salen-based
complex chemistry in crystal engineering and provide valuable details
on the compartmentalization of alkali-, alkaline-earth-, and transition-metal
ions.

Results and Discussion
The ligand H2L (Scheme 1) was synthetized
by a straightforward nucleophilic
addition from o-vanillin and ethane-1,2-diamine forming
a hemiaminal, based on a literature procedure.72 Copper(II) or nickel(II) metal ions selected as M1 have been coordinated to the deprotonated H2L ligand
(L2–). Indeed, the copper ion is preferentially
coordinated in a square pyramidal coordination, whereas the nickel
ion tends to adopt a quasiperfect square planar configuration. The
structural differences influenced by the uptake of the alkaline-earth-metal
ions between the nickel(II) and the copper(II) complexes have been
studied.

Binding of Alkaline-Earth-Metal Ions to the O2O2 Recognition Site: Solution Studies
The metalloligands
LM1 [M1 = Cu(II) or Ni(II)] were studied upon
the addition of the alkaline-earth-metal ion M2, performing 1H NMR and UV–vis titrations. The second metal ion insertion
was investigated by mixing LCu or LNi with the alkaline-earth-metal
salts. In a solvent mixture of ACN/EtOH, stoichiometric amounts were
reacted for 2 h at room temperature (RT). 1H NMR studies
have been performed on LNi ligands to investigate the formation of
the different heterometallic compounds in solution as the complexes
are diamagnetic, whereas UV–vis measurements have been performed
on LCu-derived compounds as the Cu(II) compounds are paramagnetic,
hence NMR silent, while exhibiting a color change upon addition of
the alkaline-earth-metal ion, in contrast to Ni(II) complexes.

1H NMR Study
Upon addition of aliquots of
Mg, Ca, and Sr salts to the solution of LNi, broad peaks appeared
particularly for the imine and the aromatic signals. This effect can
be explained by an intermediate exchange regime (k ≈ Δf), and only one signal is observed
with an intermediate chemical shift denoting a moderate affinity at
room temperature between the metalloligand and the alkaline-earth-metal
ion. The measurements were then performed at 70 °C to increase
the exchange rate and observe distinct shifted peaks (Figures S2–S5 and 1). Only the NMR titration with barium was carried out at room temperature
to establish the exact stoichiometry of the complex, as the spectrum
showed a neat slow exchange regime (k ≪ Δf). High-field shifts of the imine signals were observed
when the alkaline-earth-metal salts were added.

titration of LNi with Ca(NO3)2·6H2O forming the corresponding LNiCa complex
at room temperature. (b) 1H NMR titration binding isotherm
of the LNiCa complex formation focused on the imine proton signal
with the Job plot analysis performed with a constant total concentration
of [0.04 M].

The complexation of Mg,
Ca, Sr, or Ba with LNi leads to the formation
of 2:1 (LNi/M2 ratio) species in solution where a plateau
is reached upon the addition of 0.5 equiv of metal salts confirmed
by the maximum value at 0.66 on their corresponding Job plot.

UV–Vis
Measurements
The corresponding LCu compounds
were analyzed by UV–vis upon the addition of aliquots of the
alkaline-earth-metal ion solutions. The measurements were performed
in a mixture of acetonitrile and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The LCu
metalloligand showed two characteristic high-intensity bands located
below 420 nm and one broad band in the visible region.77 The strongest band appears at around 280 nm
and is assigned to the π → π* transition resulting
from the extended delocalized π-systems of the azomethine group.
A band at 360 nm is associated with the metal-to-ligand charge transfer
transition. A weak broad d–d transition band located in the
visible region is detected at around 550 nm related to the ligand
field. During the titrations, a decrease of both intense absorption
bands is detected, accompanied by an increase of slightly blue-shifted
bands (hypsochromic shift) through two isosbestic points, indicating
the transformation of one species into another. The decrease of intensity
as well as the slight hypsochromic shift is also observed for the
weak visible broad band influenced by the insertion of the second
metal ion. The binding isotherm of each titration reaches a plateau
at around 0.5 equiv of added alkaline-earth-metal ions, confirming
together with their Job plot maximum at 0.66 the formation of a 2:1
complex (Figure 2).
(Detailed data on all of the individual titrations can be found in
the Supporting Information, Figures S6–S9.)

Figure 2 (a) UV–vis titration of LCu with the Ca(NO3)2·6H2O complex. Diminution of the absorbance
of the two first bands during the titration and appearance of the
two isosbestic points and the binding isotherm of LCuCa focused on
the second band. (b) Job plot analysis performed with a constant total
concentration of [0.0001 M].

The titration of LCu with a barium salt shows a different
behavior
compared to the rest of the alkaline-earth-metal ions. For the larger
Ba(II) ion, a plateau is detected upon addition of 0.5 equiv of Ba(II)
ions. Upon further addition, a slight increase as well as a blue shift
of the bands is observed again. This phenomenon indicates the adoption
of a 2:1 species at about 0.5 equiv, before the formation of a 1:1
binding mode.

In solution, 2:1 complexes have been obtained
for the complexation
of alkaline-earth-metal ions with either LNi or LCu. The only exception
was observed for the complexation of barium with LCu.

Description
of Solid-State Structures
To explore the
way in which LCu and LNi bind to the different alkaline-earth-metal
ions, we performed single-crystal X-ray analysis on all compounds,
for which single crystals in sufficient quality could be obtained.
[LCuMg(NO3)2] is abbreviated as “LCuMg”
(1), [LCuCa(μ-NO3)]n as “LCuCa” (2), [LCuSr(NO3)2(H2O)] as “LCuSr” (3), and [(LCu)2Ba(NO3)2]
as “LCuBa” (4). For the nickel-containing
compounds, the nomenclature is the following; “LNiMg”
for [{LNiMg(NO3)(H2O)}(NO3)] (5), “LNiCa” for [LNiCa(NO3)2(H2O)] (6), “LNiSr” for [LNiSr(NO3)2(H2O)] (7), and “LNiBa”
for [(LNi)2Ba(NO3)2] (8) (a detailed description of the single-crystal structures of this
paper can be found in the Supporting Information, Figures S16–S19, Table S1) (Table 1).

Single crystals of all of the compounds were
obtained from the
mother liquor of the reaction between LCu or LNi and the corresponding
alkaline-earth salts. Each crystal structure presented below shows
a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for L/M1/M2, except for
the Ba-compounds, which adopt a 2:2:1 stoichiometry complex. In the
following compounds, Cu(II) and Ni(II) are coordinated in a quasiperfect
square planar way by the phenolate and imine groups of the N2O2 chelating entity of the ligand, with angle sums close
to 360°. Similar bond valence sums (BVSs) for M1 are
observed in the series of alkaline-earth-metal compounds, that is,
ca. 1.95 in Cu(II) complexes and 2.35 in Ni(II) compounds.78

Regarding the O2O2 recognition site in compound 1, Mg(II) is bound to
all four O-atoms of the ligand belonging
to two phenolate and methoxy groups occupying all of the cavity. The
coordination sphere of the alkaline-earth cation is completed by three
O-atoms of two nitrate anions, leading to a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal
arrangement for Mg(II). The bond valence sum provided by O1–O4,
O5–O6, and O8 amounts to 1.99, justifying the additional coordination
of O6 and hence the unusual coordination number 7 for magnesium.79−81 The LCuMg entity is not completely planar, as the two aromatic rings
form an angle of 4.36°. This is explained by an antiparallel
arrangement of the complexes, which leads to alternating parallel
strands featuring Cu(II)–C14 interactions [3.318(9) Å]
and π–π interactions along the crystallographic b-axis (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Structure of the asymmetric unit of LCuMg complex 1 (top) and packing thereof [bottom, #2(−x, 1 – y, 1 – z),
#3(1 – x, 1 – y, 1
– z), #4(1 + x, y, z)] shows the π–π interactions
(orange dashed bonds) and Cu(II)–C14 interactions (green dashed
bonds). H-atoms have been omitted for clarity.

The 1:1 Ni-homologue compound LNiMg (5) has
a slightly
different structure than LCuMg, as Mg(II) is now perfectly accommodated
in the quasiplanar ligand (Figure 4). As a major difference, the Mg(II) ion in 5 completes its coordination sphere with two O-atoms of one nitrate
anion, O5 and O6, and one molecule of water, O8. This particularity
produces two H-bonds between O8 and one O-atom, O9, of a noncoordinated
nitrate ion and an O-atom, O11, of a neighbor complex, with 2.753(6)
and 2.840(6) Å, respectively. These H-bonds generate a channel
along the crystallographic a-axis, containing the
two anions. The remaining packing resembles the LCuMg pattern with
strands of antiparallel packed complexes formed by π–π
packing between the ligands along the crystallographic b-axis as well as Ni(II)–C14 and Ni(II)–C4 interactions.

dashed bonds), π–π packing (orange dashed bonds),
and the channels (bottom, green circles); H-bonds (bottom, blue dashed
bonds) between different layers create channels along the a-axis and comprise two nitrate ions. All H-atoms, except
for the water molecules, have been omitted for clarity.

In compound LCuCa (2), the calcium
ion is coordinated
to all four oxygen atoms of the O2O2 compartment
of the ligand, as well as to five O-atoms stemming from three different
nitrate anions. With a bond valence sum (BVS) provided by O1–O4,
O5–O6, and O8–O9 of 1.91, the calcium ion completes
its coordination sphere with an additional neighboring nitrate O-donor
atom (O7) reinforcing its charge resulting in a BVS of 2.15.79,82 The calcium ion exhibits hence an unusual coordination number of
9, adopting a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic coordination
sphere. One nitrate anion binds via two O-atoms and acts as a terminal
ligand, whereas another acts as a bridging ligand and uses all of
its O-atoms to coordinate, whereby two O-donors bind to one Ca(II)
ion and the third connects to the alkaline-earth-metal ion of the
next complex entity. Hence, a one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymer
along the b-axis with an antiparallel arrangement
of the ligands is obtained. This head-to-tail configuration is explained
by the consideration of a weak bond between Cu(II) and O6 with 2.675(4)
Å. Furthermore, a weak contact between
Cu1 and C14 of a neighboring π-system with 3.621(5) Å induces
a bending of the corresponding aromatic ring of ca. 1.795 Å out
of the plane formed by the Cu–N2O2 entity
toward the calcium ion and results in nonplanarity of the ligand with
an angle of ca. 16.5° between the two aromatic planes. The calcium
ion is thus slightly pulled out of the main plane of the ligand by
roughly 0.65 Å (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Crystal structure of LCuCa complex 2 (top left, asymmetric
unit) reveals a 1D coordination polymer [#2(1/2 – x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 – z), #3(1/2
– x, −1/2 + y, 1/2
– z), #4(1 – x, 1
– y, −z)] by coordination
of the calcium ion with the neighboring O7 of a nitrate anion and
the Cu(II)–O6 weak bonds (bottom). Distortion of the ligand
via Cu(II)–C14 interactions (top right, orange dashed bonds,
bottom). H-atoms have been omitted for clarity.

The complex LNiCa (6), as well as LCuSr (3) and its nickel homologue compound LNiSr (7), adopts
a similar structural motif as the compound LCuMg (1),
except for the fact that the alkaline-earth-metal ion bears an additional
water molecule in its coordination sphere, leading to the coordination
number 9 for the group 2 ion (Figure 6). The water molecule is arranged approximately in
the same plane as the O2O2 entity of the ligand.
As in 4, the water molecule O11 produces two H-bonds
via the two nitrate oxygen atoms, O7 and O8. The arrangement in the
unit cell is governed by π–π packing interactions
between two parallel neighbor units expanding in a stairlike motif
along the b-axis. An antiparallel arrangement of
ligand π–system interactions completes this expansion
via Cu(II)–C4 interactions. Compared to compound LCuMg (1), this motif is altered by the presence of H-bonds, which
allows this exact pattern to be reproduced along the b-axis forming alternating layers.

Figure 6 Crystal structure of LCuSr complex 3 [top, #2(x, −1 + y, z),
#3(1/2 – x, −1/2 – y, 1/2 + z), #5(1/2 – x,
1/2 + y, −1/2 + z)] presenting
similar characteristics as compounds LNiCa (6) and LNiSr
(7). They show an antiparallel arrangement of complexes
via Cu(II)–C14 (green dashed bonds) and π–π
interactions (orange dashed bonds, top). The presence of H-bonds creates
different layers shown from the top and from the profile (bottom,
blue dashed bonds, bottom). All H-atoms, except for water molecules,
have been omitted for clarity.

The complexation of barium with LCu and LNi leads to the
formation
of 2:1 complexes LCuBa (4) and LNiBa (8),
which are unique in this series of solid-state structures (Figure 7). The barium cation
is too large to fit into the O2O2 compartment
of the ligand; hence, a sandwich-type structure is preferred. Due
to its large ionic radius, the barium ion is able to accommodate two
ligands forming a sandwich complex using all O-atoms of the ligands.
The asymmetric unit is composed of two sandwich entities. The metalloligands
of one complex are parallel to each other, exhibiting an offset angle
of ca. 48° for the Ba1 complex and 47° for the Ba2 complex.
In addition, four O-atoms of two nitrate ions coordinate to Ba1, whereas
only three O-atoms of two nitrate moieties bind to Ba2. This leads
to a coordination number of 12 for Ba1 and 11 for Ba2, with BVS of
2.21 and 2.25, respectively. The two independent complexes form an
angle of ca. 74° with respect to each other and are linked to
symmetry equivalents via Cu(II)−π interactions along
the a-axis.

Figure 7 Crystal structure of the sandwich arrangement
of LCuBa complex 4. All H-atoms have been omitted for
clarity.

Overall, the solid-state structures
reveal predominantly complexes
with 1:1 stoichiometry, except LCuBa (4) or LNiBa (8), which form sandwich-type arrangements. Indeed, a larger
cation like barium cannot be accommodated in the mean plane of the
O2O2 cavity; hence, a sandwich-type structure
is preferred. As observed in our previous studies,71 alkali metal ions with ionic radii bigger than ca. 135
pm (Ba2+ = 135 pm, K+ = 138 pm, Rb+ = 158 pm, Cs+ = 167 pm) are generally pushed out of the
M1-N2O2 main plane forming eventually
coordination polymers or sandwich configurations. Andruh et al.83,84 and Costes et al.85 have obtained several
complexes based on o-vanilin and composed of Cu(II)
or Ni(II) combined with Ln(III), where M2 tends to be located
out of the M1-N2O2 plane. Indeed,
the use of longer amine chains in the ligand synthesis allows a higher
degree of freedom to the transition-metal coordination in the N2O2 chelating moiety, leading to a greater scaffold
distortion. Compounds LCuSr (3), LNiMg (5), LNiCa (6), and LNiSr (7) bear one water
molecule, allowing the generation of H-bonds, which induces the formation
of alternating layers. While all of the remaining 1:1 structures follow
a similar packing pattern via M–C as well as π–π
interactions, LCuCa (2) adopts a one-dimensional coordination
polymer structure by involving a bridging nitrate anion.

The
alkaline-earth and alkali complexes71 exhibit
different structural trends. While the LCu–alkali
complexes are arranged in an antiparallel fashion to form 1D coordination
polymers most of the time, the LNi–alkali compounds formed
polar chains with the ligands pointing to the same side of the coordination
polymer chain. This could be explained by the fact that Cu(II) was
less well coordinated by the N2O2 moiety (BVS
< 2) than Ni(II) and interacted thus more strongly with counterions,
whereas in the Ni(II) compounds, the metal−π interactions
dominated. For the herein presented alkaline-earth-metal complexes
of LCu and LNi, no clear trend in the packing of the complex moieties
can be observed, despite the comparable trend in the bond valence
sum. Cu(II) seems “satisfied” with its coordination
and does not “seek” further ligands, as exemplified
by only weak contacts to carbon atoms of neighbor aromatic rings.
One reason for this may be based on the fact that the alkaline-earth-metal
cations are smaller and charged 2+, fitting better into the O2O2 cavity compared to the alkali-metal homologues.
Indeed, the coordination of larger cations like alkali-metal ions
causes a slight deformation of the ligand scaffold, leading to a change
in the aromaticity. This effect promotes thus close interactions between
Cu(II) and additional neighboring O-atoms to satisfy the charge of
the copper. Another difference compared to the alkali-metal compounds
is the coordination of a water molecule to the alkaline-earth-metal
ions in most of the herein shown cases, leading to H-bonds among the
different complexes. Finally, the alkaline-earth-metal complexes of
LCu and LNi require two counterions to balance the charge. These counterions
are in many cases placed in axial positions with respect to the ligand
donor atoms and repel each other between two neighbor complexes, leading
to antiparallel arrangements. Overall, the alkaline-earth-metal ions
are also well shielded by the coordinating entities and do not possess
free space for further, eventually, bridging coordination, except
for compound LCuCa (2), where no water molecule is bound,
leaving space for an additional O-atom that comes from a bridging
nitrate ion. Thus, the Ca(II) ion is displaced out of the main plane
of the ligand with a distance of ca. 0.65 Å, distorting the LCu
ligand with an angle of ca. 16.5°. This effect induces hence
a slight disturbance of the aromaticity and a close interaction between
Cu(II) and the O-atom of a nearby nitrate ion generating this head-to-tail
arrangement of the polymer. We thus tried to obtain all compounds
in their water-free form, but the resulting material is amorphous
or does not crystallize well enough to determine their structure.

Conclusions
New alkaline-earth-metal-containing complexes
derived from a salen-based
ligand beforehand coordinated to M1 = Cu(II) or Ni(II)
have been studied. The coordination of the N2O2 recognition site of the ligand H2L to M1 generates
a Ω-shaped O2O2 chelating site able to
host alkaline-earth-metal ions M2. The M2 recognition
was explored in solution by UV–vis and 1H NMR titrations
at different temperatures and showed an evident presence of 2:1 (LM1/M2) compounds, upon the addition of different
alkaline-earth salts. A 2:1 stoichiometry complex in solution has
been confirmed, whereas in most cases, one single stoichiometry was
favored in the solid state. The X-ray crystallographic measurements
of the different alkaline-earth complexes exhibit a neat tendency
toward a 1:1:1 (L/M1/M2) composition, except
for Ba(II). The compounds corresponding to the 2:1 ratio might indicate
the presence of oligomers stemming from a coordination polymer. The
main difference between the alkali and alkaline-earth complexes is
that no typical arrangement was detected according to the use of different
transition-metal ions in this work. Although having bond valence values
similar to those of the alkali-containing complexes, Cu(II) does not
seek further ligands to complete its coordination sphere as seen in
the alkali study. This may be explained by the fact that the alkaline-earth-metal
cations are smaller and charged 2+, fitting better into the O2O2 compartment and two axially binding anions.
The binding capability of salen-type compounds and the combination
of two distinct metal ions within one ligand represent an important
benefit in diverse research fields. Especially, the elaboration of
new mixed oxide material precursors as well as optical probe compounds
is actually ongoing in our group.

Experimental Section
General
All experiments were performed in air at RT.
Both complex ligands LCu and LNi were prepared as described in the
literature.86,87 All chemicals were commercial
products of reagent grade and were used without further purification. 1H and 13C measurements were performed for the Ni(II)
compounds with a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer at RT, and chemical
shifts are given in parts per million with respect to the residual
solvent peak. Mass spectra (electrospray ionization (ESI)-time-of-flight,
positive mode) were recorded with a Bruker Esquire HCT spectrometer
with a DMF/ACN mixture as the solvent. For each compound, the bimetallic
complexes with a counterion have been observed due to the ionization.
The UV/vis spectra were recorded for Cu complexes with a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda 40 spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction investigations were
carried out on a Stoe STADI P diffractometer with CuK (λ = 1.5406
Å) radiation. In most cases, the powder X-ray spectrum of each
bulk compound corresponds well to the respective single-crystal data;
a high background also indicates amorphous contributions that might
slightly falsify the data of the elemental analyses (X-ray powder
diffraction (PXRD) diffractograms can be found in the Supporting Information, Figures S10–S15, except for LCuMg (1) and LNiBa (8) due to a strong amorphous contribution).
Elemental analyses for C, H, and N were carried out using a FLASH
2000 Organic Elemental Analyzer. The elemental analysis relative to
LNiBa (8) compound has not been shown in this work due
to the possible interferences with the metals during the mineralization.
The precipitates for each compound were dried and measured. However,
some of the results show the residual solvent or water molecule. Powder
X-ray diffraction investigations were carried out on a Stoe STADI
P diffractometer with CuK (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. In
most cases, the powder X-ray spectrum of the precipitate compound
corresponds well to the respective single-crystal data; a high background
also indicates amorphous contributions that might slightly falsify
the data of the elemental analyses (PXRD diffractograms can be found
in the Supporting Information, Figures S10–S15, except for LCuMg (1) and LNiBa (8) due
to a strong amorphous contribution). The crystallographic data of
single crystals were collected with Mo Kα radiation (λ
= 0.71073 Å). The measurements were performed at 200 and 250
K for the compounds 5 and 8, with Stoe IPDS-II
or IPDS-II T diffractometers equipped with Oxford Cryosystem open-flow
cryostats.88 Single crystals were placed
in an inert oil, picked under the microscope, and mounted on loops.
All geometric and intensity data were collected from one single crystal.
The absorption corrections were partially integrated in the data reduction
procedure.89 The structures were solved
and refined using full-matrix least squares on F2 with the SHELX-2014 package.90 All atoms, except hydrogen atoms, were refined anisotropically.
Hydrogen atoms were refined where possible and otherwise added using
the riding model position parameters. Crystallographic data can be
found in the Supporting Information (see Table S1). CIF files can be obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre: CCDC-1860971 (1), CCDC-1860972 (2), CCDC-1860973 (3), CCDC-1860974 (4),
CCDC-1860975 (5), and CCDC-1860976 (6), CCDC-1860977 (7), and CCDC-1860978 (8).

Synthesis of Complexes [LCu(H2O)] “LCu”
and LNi
The complexes LCu and LNi were prepared by adaptation
of a literature procedure.86,87

Synthesis of the Magnesium
Complex [LCuMg(NO3)2] LCuMg (1)
A solution of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (65.76 mg, 0.256 mmol)
was added to a solution of LCu (100 mg, 0.256 mmol), previously dissolved
in a mixture of acetonitrile/ethanol (7:3, 30 mL). The reaction mixture
turned dark purple immediately. After being stirred for 2 h at room
temperature, the solvent of the resulting solution was removed under
reduced pressure to produce a powder of the complex 1 (110 mg, 79.83%). X-ray-suitable single crystals were obtained by
dissolving (1) in a mixture of acetonitrile/ethanol (7:3,
30 mL), which was allowed to evaporate at room temperature for 1 week;
purple, needlelike single crystals were obtained. ESI-MS (m/z): 475.02 [M – NO3]+, where M corresponds to LCuMg(NO3)2. Anal. calcd for C18H22CuMg N4O12 corresponding to LCuMg (1) containing two H2O molecules: C, 37.65; H, 3.86; N, 9.76%. Found: C, 36.89;

Synthesis of the Calcium Complex [LCuCa(μ-NO3)]n LCuCa (2)
A
solution of Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (60.45
mg, 0.256 mmol) was added to a solution of LCu (100 mg, 0.256 mmol),
previously dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile/ethanol (7:3, 30
mL). The reaction mixture turned dark purple immediately. After being
stirred for 2 h at room temperature, the resulting solution was partially
evaporated and the product was precipitated with diethyl ether. The
precipitate was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to
produce the complex 2 (105 mg, 74.03%). The filtrate
was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 week after partial
evaporation of the solvent; dark green, needlelike single crystals
suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained. ESI-MS

Synthesis of the Strontium
Complex [LCuSr(NO3)2(H2O)] LCuSr
(3)
A solution
of Sr(NO3)2 (54.17 mg, 0.256 mmol) was added
to a solution of LCu (100 mg, 0.256 mmol) in a mixture of acetonitrile/ethanol
(7:3, 30 mL). The mixture turned red immediately, and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The precipitate was
collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to produce the complex 3 (96 mg, 62.34%). Red rhombohedral-like single crystals were
obtained by vapor phase diffusion of diethyl ether into the mother
liquor of the reaction in a long tube. ESI-MS (m/z): 538.94 [M – NO3]+, where
M corresponds to LCuSr(NO3)2. Anal. calcd for

9.31%. Found: C, 34.54; H, 1.86; N, 9.51%.

Synthesis of the Barium
Complex [(LCu)2Ba(NO3)2] LCuBa (4)
A solution
of Ba(NO3)2 (66.90 mg, 0.256 mmol) was added
to a solution of LCu (100 mg, 0.256 mmol) in a mixture of acetonitrile/ethanol
(7:3, 30 mL). The mixture turned red immediately, and after being
stirred for 2 h at room temperature, the resulting solution was partially
evaporated and the product was precipitated with diethyl ether. The
precipitate was collected and dried under vacuum to afford the complex 4 (112 mg, 42.02%). After a few days, red needlelike single
crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis were obtained
by vapor phase diffusion of diethyl ether into the mother liquor of
the reaction in a long tube. ESI-MS (m/z): 978.01. [M – NO3]+, where M corresponds

1H NMR Spectroscopy
Titration
LNi samples
were prepared in deuterated DMSO by varying the M(NO3)2 stoichiometry from 0 to 2 equiv (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). Spectra
of the nickel complexes were recorded at 70 °C with
a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer, except for Ba, whose spectra were recorded
at RT. Due to the paramagnetism of the Cu(II) compounds, no 1H NMR measurements were performed on these complexes. A Job plot
was performed under the condition where the sum of the concentrations
of the host and the guest is constantly [0.04 M] in DMSO. Binding
isotherms as well as Job plots were collected, taking the imine peaks
as a reference.

UV–Vis Titration
Samples
containing 0.1 mM LCu
in acetonitrile were prepared (3 mL in the cuvette). Alkaline-earth-metal
salts were added from 0 to 3 equiv using 0.03 M solutions of M(NO3) (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) in DMSO (addition of 2 μL). Spectra
were recorded at RT in a 1 mm path-length quartz cell on a Perkin-Elmer
Lambda 40 spectrometer. Job plots were performed where the sum of
the concentrations of the host and the guest was [0.0001 M] in a mixture
of DMSO and acetonitrile. Binding isotherms as well as Job plots were
collected, taking a wavelength of 373 nm as a reference.
