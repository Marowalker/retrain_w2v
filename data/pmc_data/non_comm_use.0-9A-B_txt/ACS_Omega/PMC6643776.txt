The
growth of high surface area alumina has been investigated with
the use of a liquid Galinstan alloy [66.5% (wt %) Ga, 20.5% In and
13.0% Sn] as an activator for aluminum. In this process, the aluminum
is slowly dissolved into the gallium–indium–tin alloy,
which is then selectively oxidized at ambient temperature and pressure
under a humid stream of flowing CO2 or N2 to
yield amorphous alumina. This preparative route represents a simple
and low toxicity approach to obtain amorphous high surface area alumina
with very low water content. The as-synthesized high surface area
alumina aerogel was a blue-colored solid owing to the Rayleigh scattering
by its dendritic fibrous nanostructure consisting of mainly alumina
with small amounts of water. Upon annealing at 850 °C, the amorphous
product transformed into γ-Al2O3, as well
as θ-Al2O3 upon annealing at 1050 °C.
Elemental analysis by energy-dispersive spectroscopy provides further
evidence that the high surface area alumina is composed of only aluminum
and oxygen. The surface area of the amorphous alumina varied from
∼79 to ∼140 m2/g, depending on the initial
weight percentage of aluminum used in the alloy. A correlation between
the initial concentration of aluminum in the alloy and the surface
area of the alumina product was found to peak at ∼30% Al. These
results suggest a novel route to the formation of amorphous alumina
aerogel-type materials.

Introduction
Aerogel materials have
been the subject of a large field of research
since the initial discovery by Kistler in 1931.1 Since then, the formation of highly porous three-dimensional
networks has been intensely investigated for a wide variety of compounds
including organics, organic–inorganic hybrids, and inorganic
oxides.2 The open and airy nature of aerogels
make them ideal materials for a wide array of applications including
for high-temperature thermal insulation, as refractory catalyst supports,
for absorption of heavy metal ions and pollution removal, and in many
other applications.2−5 However, conventional methods for producing these highly porous
aerogel materials are generally complex, involving a precise sequence
of hydrolysis and condensation reactions, followed by solvent removal
that can lead to cracking or up to a complete collapse of the open
network.

Recent studies into the growth of aluminum-based aerogels
have
resulted in highly ordered and monolithic forms via a direct oxidation
of aluminum by activating the surface of aluminum metal with either
mercury6−13 or gallium.13−15 The amalgam produced by the interaction of the different
metals inhibits the formation of a passivation layer from developing
on metallic aluminum, thereby achieving a continuous diffusion of
aluminum through the liquid metal to react with the air and/or water
vapor to produce the alumina aerogel and hydrogen gas.16 As the mercury and gallium wet the surface of
aluminum, the liquid metals penetrate the aluminum grain boundaries
through a process known as liquid metal embrittlement.17−27 Some issues surrounding the previous production of alumina aerogels
are the use of toxic mercury, a high water content in the final product
that is difficult to remove, and the need for high-purity aluminum
metal for the reaction to proceed to completion.

Described herein
is an investigation into the conditions for the
growth of high-purity alumina aerogel that can be accomplished using
a gallium–indium–tin liquid metal alloy, that is, without
the use of toxic liquid mercury and very low or no water content in
the product. Many reports have recently demonstrated the capability
of Ga–In–Sn and similar alloys to activate the surface
of aluminum for its rapid hydrogen evolution reactions with water.28−44 However, investigations have not yet focused on the potential growth
of aerogels using this alloy at room temperature. A novel process
has been investigated that can function to activate aluminum contained
within either pure or impure aluminum alloys, such as 7075 used for
aircraft parts, for its oxidation and growth, producing a high-purity,
high surface area similar to an aerogel-like material. Thus, the ability
to harness waste sources of impure aluminum in this process offers
an innovative way to recycle aluminum that has been conventionally
difficult to recycle previously.45,46

Results and Discussion
After the aluminum was dissolved within the Ga–In–Sn
liquid alloy, that is, Galinstan alloy, the activated aluminum at
the surface reacts with the water vapor to produce hydrogen gas and
the freshly oxidized alumina aerogel. The reaction vessel has sources
for either a wet or dry carrier gas by bubbling through water to introduce
water vapor. Within the first few seconds of flowing H2O vapor carried by CO2, the mixture turned dark, after
which light blue solids grew out of the mixture. The synthesis of
the solid material continued over the course of 4 h until the gas
flow was halted. By varying the initial aluminum percentage, light
blue and partially transparent solids were produced, except for the
2% aluminum mixture, as shown in Figure 1. Similar aerogel growth was observed using
the 7075-aluminum alloy, as shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information, indicating that this
process is not inhibited by the low purity of aluminum in the alloy.
Higher percentages of aluminum (30–60%) favored the growth
of tendril-like morphologies compared to the monolithic growths of
alumina observed with the 2 and 10% mixtures, as shown in Figures 2–4. As shown in Figure 2, at the higher dissolved concentrations
of aluminum in the liquid alloy, that is, 40% and 60%, the aluminum
within small isolated droplets of the liquid alloy will become oxidized
and form an alumina shell. The droplet is then squeezed out of the
shell whereupon further aluminum in it oxidizes again to form another
alumina shell. This process repeats itself to generate worm-like tubular
structures of the alumina aerogel material. The worm-like structures
and internal droplets of the liquid alloy are both visible in the
optical microscope images in Figure 2. This process occurs across the numerous liquid alloy
droplets which then produces a bulk amount of blue-tinted worm-like
tubular structures.

Figure 4 TEM images of alumina aerogel immediately postsynthesis
(left),
and after heating to 600 °C for 24 h (right).

As shown in Figures 4 and 5, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)
images of the blue-tinted alumina revealed a densely packed fibrous
structure similar to aerogels produced from mercury-based amalgams.14 The fibrous products were studied further with
the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after the initial
synthesis and after annealing the solid at 600 °C for 24 h, as
shown in Figure 4.
The spindles of growth are approximately 10–30 nm across in
both high- and low-density growth areas. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy
image of the aerogels grown from pure aluminum indicated the presence
of only aluminum and oxygen with the relative weight percentages listed
in Table 1. The calculated
molar ratios between aluminum and oxygen for each reaction mixture
indicate that the composition of the aerogel matches roughly with
that calculated for Al2O3. Images were also
taken after approximately 5 min of water vapor exposure using the
7075-aluminum alloy, as shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. A distinct interface was observed
where the solid alumina aerogel broke through the high-surface-tension
liquid metal, shown in Figure 5. The alumina growth was halted after ∼30 s to analyze
the growth front of the alumina on top of the liquid Galinstan alloy.
Elemental analysis shows that the aluminum and oxygen are concentrated
at the upper half of the growth zone, whereas the gallium, indium,
and tin are concentrated at the lower half of the growth zone that
constitutes the liquid alloy. Some dissolved aluminum is also detected
in the liquid alloy on the lower half, as the growth has not yet consumed
all of the aluminum in the alloy.

Powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the as-synthesized
alumina aerogels, as well as after heating to high temperatures, were
collected and fitted to known alumina crystalline phases, shown in Figure 6 and given in the Supporting Information in Figure S4. The initial
diffraction shows no distinguishable peaks indicating the formation
of an amorphous material or particles too small to diffract.8 This is consistent with other reported products
of aerogels grown from the direct oxidation of aluminum in a liquid–metal
amalgam. Next, the amorphous alumina was heated separately at 600,
850, and 1050 °C to crystallize the alumina. Each alumina sample
transformed similarly under the different heating temperatures, with
the samples changing color from light blue to white. Each of the solids
remained amorphous after annealing at 600 °C for 24 h in air.
New diffraction peaks corresponding to γ-Al2O3 were detected after annealing the materials at 850 °C
for 48 h for all samples. Further heating at 1050 °C for 48 h
leads to the growth of diffraction peaks likely corresponding to the
θ-Al2O3 polymorph, but which is difficult
to distinguish owing to the nanocrystallinity of the product and the
broad diffraction peaks. These data provide additional evidence that
the as-synthesized and annealed products likely are of the same composition
with no other metal impurities arising from the Galinstan alloy.

diffraction pattern for each of the high surface area alumina aerogels.
Samples heated to temperatures of 600, 850, and 1050 °C are found
to produce diffraction peaks corresponding approximately to γ,
and θ-Al2O3 polymorphs. PXRD plots for
all samples are included in the Supporting Information in Figure S3.

One major obstacle faced
with the previously synthesized alumina
aerogels has been their high water content. Infrared spectroscopy
for each sample was conducted to determine if water was a major component
of the aerogel, shown in Figure 7. Relatively small peaks were detected at ∼1595
and ∼3350 cm–1 corresponding to O–H
stretches and bending from water in each of the synthesized aerogel
materials.47,48 However, these peaks are greatly
diminished or disappear entirely after heating the solidas in air
at 600, 850, and then 1050 °C. The peaks related to Al–O
stretches at ∼526 and ∼842 cm–1 remain
unchanged during the heating process.

Figure 7 Infrared spectroscopy of the 10% alumina
sample shows the minor
water content in the synthesized alumina aerogel. Annealing at 600,
850, and 1050 °C removes the water from the material while the
peaks for Al–O vibration remain relatively unchanged. The remaining
IR plots for all samples are in the Supporting Information Figure S5.

To determine whether the water detected through IR was a
result
of water being absorbed on the surface, or water content contained
within the bulk of the alumina aerogel, thermogravimetric analysis
was conducted for each material. The aerogel was heated at 600 °C
for 24 h under flowing nitrogen to record the mass change over time.
As seen from initial PXRD, the alumina remains amorphous when heated
at this temperature. The results from the thermal gravimetric analysis
(TGA) show a continuous mass loss for over 800–1200 min as
water is removed from the material before reaching a stable mass,
as shown in Figure 8 with the 10% aluminum mixture as the representative case. Thermogravimetric
data from the other alumina compositions are given in the Supporting Information in Figure S6. The total
amount of water loss was calculated by the decrease between the initial
and final masses, listed in Table 2. The mole percentages of the water lost from the amorphous
alumina aerogel were calculated for each composition and found to
be in the range from ∼1.2 to ∼7.5 weight percent. This
apparently represents the lowest water content within any reported
alumina-based aerogel grown from an amalgam. Data from TGA and electron
microscopy, in conjunction with the IR spectroscopy, support the claim
that water is not a major component of the aerogel structure.

thermogravimetric analysis of the 10% alumina
aerogel sample as it is heated at 600 °C for 24 h under flowing
nitrogen. The remaining TGA plots for all samples are in the Supporting Information Figure S5.

The specific surface areas of each as-synthesized
high surface
area alumina aerogel, measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area measurements, are shown in Figure 9 and listed in Table 1. As the weight percentage of aluminum in
the aluminum–alloy mixture increases from 0 to 30%, the surface
area of the product increases from ∼79 to ∼140 m2/g, and then decreases with higher percentages of aluminum.
Changes in the surface area are likely because of a combination of
factors, including the concentration of aluminum within the mixture
and the viscosity of the mixture. Increasing the aluminum weight percentage
in the alloy changed the overall consistency of the liquid metal.
The alloy behaved as a free-flowing liquid at low concentrations (2–10%),
but manifested characteristics of a paste at the higher weight percentages
of aluminum. Thus, the slower diffusion of aluminum to the surface
of the alloy impacted the density of the grown aerogel with the more
optimal weight percentage of 30% aluminum. As the concentration of
aluminum increased, the mixture became more viscous, and thus more
difficult for aluminum to diffuse to the surface, resulting in loosely
packed solid fibers, and thus increasing the total surface areas.
However, when the concentration of the aluminum was increased to ∼40–60%,
the high concentration of aluminum likely overcomes the slow diffusion
and creates more densely packed fibers, decreasing the surface area.
Variations of the surface tension for each of the aluminum–alloy
mixtures are key factors that play a role in the density of growth.
The highest surface tension was observed for the 2 and 10% aluminum–alloy
mixtures which lead to the beading of the liquid metal, producing
densely packed fibers and thus lower surface areas.

Figure 9 Surface areas of high
surface area alumina aerogel synthesized
with aluminum alloy mixtures of different weight percentages of aluminum
according to the data given in Table 1.

The ability for Ga–In–Sn
alloys, with dissolved aluminum,
to reduce water into hydrogen gas is widely known as previously cited.
During the direct oxidation of aluminum, the protons of water are
reduced to molecular hydrogen after it is absorbed on the activated
aluminum surface. Conventionally, the aluminum is directly submerged
in the water and hydrogen bubbles out of the solution. In these experiments,
water vapor was passed over the activated metal to drive the production
of the aerogel. Gas chromatography of the headspace during and after
the aerogel growth confirms that hydrogen is also produced with this
method, shown in the Supporting Information Figure S7. One advantage of this method is that during the production
of hydrogen gas, atomic hydrogen is attached to the metal surface.
The atomic hydrogen could then potentially be used for additional
reductive reactions through a process of hydrogen spillover.49

Conclusions
Alumina aerogels with
high surface areas were synthesized by flowing
water vapor over mixtures of different weight percentages of aluminum
dissolved within a gallium–indium–tin alloy at ambient
temperature and pressure. The as high surface area alumina aerogel
was a blue solid with an amorphous, fibrous structure, containing
mainly alumina with small amounts of water. Upon annealing at 850
°C, the amorphous products transformed into γ-Al2O3, and likely further into θ-Al2O3 upon annealing at 1050 °C, which provides further evidence
that the high surface area solids synthesized contain mainly Al2O3. The overall surface area of the aerogels was
directly related to the initial weight percentage of aluminum in the
alloy. This is likely an impact of a combination of the concentration
of aluminum, surface tension of the alloy, and the diffusivity of
dissolved aluminum. The preliminary results presented in this work
provide guidance to select the concentration of the aluminum–alloy
mixture to maximize the surface area of the alumina. Additional investigations
on the kinetics of the aerogel growth are necessary to further optimize
the reaction conditions to maximize the surface areas of the alumina.
Further, the synthetic method presented in this work demonstrates
a nontoxic way to synthesize alumina aerogel by direct oxidation of
aluminum at ambient temperature and pressure. The direct oxidation
of aluminum with water vapor generates hydrogen gas, and thus the
exploration of the ability of hydrogen storage and regeneration of
aluminum dissolved in the Ga–In–Sn alloy will be of
further interest.

Experimental Methods
Materials
UHV
grade aluminum foil with 99.99% purity
was purchased from All Foils, Incorporated. Aluminum 7075 alloy was
purchased from Alcoa. The Ga–In–Sn alloy was prepared
in the lab with (wt %) 66.504% of Ga, 20.505% of In, and 12.992% of
Sn. The carrier gases, CO2, and N2 of Grade
4.0 were purchased from ARC3 Gases.

Synthesis
Shredded
aluminum foil was dissolved into
the Ga–In–Sn alloy at weight percentages of 2, 10, 20,
30, 40, and 60% within an argon-atmosphere glovebox. Approximately,
1 g of the aluminum alloy mixture was placed into a tungsten crucible
and dispersed to maximize the contact with the flowing gas. The crucible
was then placed in a reaction vessel which allowed a carrier gas to
pass over the metal alloy (with exclusion of oxygen), as shown in
the Supporting Information, Figure S1. The carrier gas, typically
carbon dioxide, was either introduced dry or was bubbled through a
water-containing flask to generate a humid CO2 gas flow
before entering the reaction vessel and then exiting through a beaker
of mineral oil to prevent a back-flow of gas.

The blue-tinted
alumina materials were separated mechanically under an optical microscope.
Two heat treatments were performed consecutively for each of the aerogel
products. During the first process, the sample was annealed at 850
°C for 48 h, and during the second step, the sample was further
annealed at 1050 °C for 48 h. After each step, the sample was
characterized by infrared spectroscopy and PXRD as described below.

Characterization
The SEM images were taken using JEOL
6010LA SEM. The working distance ranges from 10 to 12 mm, the spot
size ranged from 49 to 55, and the accelerating voltage ranged from
5 to 20 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was used to
determine elemental composition maps and spectra, using a JEOL EDXS
silicon drift detector. The TEM images were recorded using JEOL 2000FX
with the samples suspended on a copper grid. The structure and crystallinity
of each product was measured by PXRD, which was carried out on Rigaku
R-Axis Spider using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å)
from a sealed tube X-ray source (40 kV, 36 mA) and a curved image-plate
detector. Mid-infrared (400–4000 cm–1) spectra
of each solid product were taken on an IRPrestige-21 Shimadzu Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer equipped with a GladiATR accessory
with 4.0 wavenumber (cm–1) resolution.

TGA
was performed on a TA Instruments TGA Q50 by loading 1–3 mg
of each product onto a platinum pan. Under flowing N2,
the pan was equilibrated and tared at room temperature, heated at
the maximum heating rate to 600 °C, and held isothermally for
24 h until the weight of the sample stabilized. The water content
in the sample was calculated by the weight loss of the sample. The
post-heated TGA residues were characterized by IR and PXRD, as described
above. Specific surface areas of each product were measured on Quantachrome
ChemBET Pulsar TPR/TPD. The samples were degassed by heating to 200
°C under flowing N2 for 4 h, then cooled with liquid
nitrogen, and analyzed using a 30% He/N2 gas mixture.
