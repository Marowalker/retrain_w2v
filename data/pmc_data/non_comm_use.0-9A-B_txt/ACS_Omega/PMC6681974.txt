The
use of multivalent glycoconjugate vaccines has dramatically
contributed to reduce the incidence of meningococcal infectious disease.
The advanced structural characterization of polysaccharide conjugates
leads to enhancements in the quality and control of the products.
Here, we report a novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method to
confirm the identity and structural conformity (e.g., O-acetyl content) of saccharide antigens that comprise a licensed
tetravalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y vaccine. For the
first time, the NMR methodology is applied on a formulation (licensed
vaccine) containing a large excess of excipient (i.e., sucrose) without
analytical sample pretreatment. This work confirms the applicability
of a rapid and easy NMR assay on a multivalent conjugate vaccine,
which might be extended to other combination vaccines that are already
licensed or in clinical development.

==== Body
Introduction
Multivalent polysaccharide (PS) conjugate
vaccines have been licensed
to prevent bacterial infection caused by serogroup A, C, W, and Y
of Neisseria meningitidis.1 A pentavalent combination vaccine including the
additional serogroup X is currently under clinical development and
the results of a phase I clinical trial have been recently published.2

When different antigens are combined to
form a multivalent vaccine,
a panel of tests that is able to characterize the formulation in terms
of potency, stability, identity, and strength has to be developed.
Although tests might be in place for single components, it is important
to determine if their combination gives rise to compatibility issues
that might change some characteristics of single antigens (i.e., stability,
immunogenicity). Physicochemical and immunological tests are commonly
used to compare the biological activity of individual antigens before
and after the combination, allowing for the quantification of any
chemical/immunological interference. The structural integrity and
stability of PS-based antigens is a critical quality attribute to
be assessed after combination and is a common indicator of the product
stability and vaccine potency. For instance, the generation of the
unconjugated saccharide or the release of functional groups (i.e.,
O-acetylation, OAc) relevant for a functional PS epitope can dramatically
affect the vaccine potency.

The meningococcal (Men) serogroups
A, C, W, and Y capsular PS repeating
units have the chemical structures →6)-α-d-ManpNAc(3/4OAc)-(1→OPO3→; →9)-α-d-Neu5Ac(7/8OAc)-(2→; →6)-α-d-Galp-(1→4)-α-d-Neu5Ac(7/9OAc)-(2→;
→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→4)-α-d-Neu5Ac(7/9OAc)-(2→, respectively (Figure 1).3 MenA PS is partly O-acetylated at position C3 or C4, while all MenCWY PS contain Neu5Ac moiety in the relative
repeating units that are partially O-acetylated at the glycerol chain
of Neu5Ac (at position C7 and C8 for serogroup
C and at position C7 and C9 for serogroup W
and Y).3

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is currently used
in the advanced characterization and quality control of existing and
novel products.4,5 NMR applications have been first
developed and implemented for structure determination and for identity/integrity
testing of the carbohydrate components. NMR provides a single generic
tool that is able to replace a wide range of wet chemical/chromatographic
approaches that have been largely used in the past whilst providing
more precise data. NMR-based methods for the identification and quantification
of known impurities that have previously been determined by indirect
approaches, or not suspected to be present, have been developed,4−6 as well as for absolute quantification of PS content.7,8

1H, 13C, and 31P NMR methods
have
been applied for the characterization and purity evaluation (both
product and process related impurities) of manufacturing intermediates
starting from the purification process of native PSs, the activated
intermediates before protein coupling and to the final monovalent
bulk conjugates.4,6 For multivalent vaccines, the
complexity due to the combination of several PS antigens with common
motifs in their repeating units which results in diffused overlapping
of signals in the NMR profile, the presence of a large excess of the
excipient for lyophilization (e.g., sucrose, mannitol) which dominates
the spectrum, as well as the relatively low concentration of antigens
as carbohydrate content (i.e. 1–10 μg/dose) have strongly
limited the application of NMR methodologies. Recent advances in liquid-state
NMR spectroscopy and, in particular, (a) higher peak to peak resolution
at stronger magnetic field (proton frequency up to 1 GHz) and (b)
cryoprobe technology (increased sensitivity of the probe coil which
also results in shorter acquisition time) have provided insights into
the challenges.

Herein, we report the development of a novel
NMR-based assay applied
to the tetravalent vaccine against meningococcal serogroup A, C, W,
Y infection, licensed for human use in a two-vial presentation (a
lyophilized monovalent MenA component with sucrose/potassium dihydrogen
phosphate as excipient to be reconstituted with the liquid MenCWY
component immediately before injection),9 and an investigational liquid formulation currently in clinical
trial.10,11

The commercial Menveo vaccine contains
size-reduced oligosaccharides
of serogroups A, C, W, and Y, conjugated to a nontoxic mutant of Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin, termed “cross
reacting material 197” (CRM197). Each 0.5 mL dose
of vaccine contains 10 μg of MenA oligosaccharide and 5 μg
of each of MenC, MenY, and MenW oligosaccharides and 32.7–64.1
μg of CRM197 protein.9

This methodology has confirmed the applicability of NMR spectroscopy
on a final combination conjugate vaccine as an identity and structural
conformity test (i.e., O-acetyl content of the MenA
antigen) of the carbohydrate moieties.

Results and Discussion
Identity
Test of MenACWY Antigens
In accordance with
the strategy applied for the development of an identity test method
successfully developed for the 23-valent pneumococcal PS-based combination
vaccine (Pneumovax23, Merck), where one proton NMR signal as the “probe
signal” for each antigen has to be compared with the reference12 and also with the experience collected internally
on the method developed for MenACWY monovalent purified PS antigens;
other process intermediates and bulk glycoconjugates (recently included
as the reference method in the USP monograph ⟨198⟩),18 where five signals for each antigen have been
used for comparison with references, the feasibility of a new identity
test has been investigated.6

As shown
in Figure 1 (schematic
representation of MenACWY-CRM197 conjugates), the proton
signals H1ManNAc (proton at position C1 of ManNAc residues) for MenA,
H3eqNeu5Ac-8OAc (proton at position equatorial C3 of the Neu5Ac residues
O-acetylated at position C8) for MenC, H1Gal (proton at position C1 of the Gal residues) for MenW, H1Glc (proton at position C1 of the
Glc residues) for MenY have been selected as probe signals. For MenC,
the protons at C3 equatorial position of Neu5Ac residues
resonate at different chemical shifts, depending on the position (C7 or C8) of the OAc group (2.92 and 2.79 ppm for
H3eqNeu5Ac-7OAc and H3eqNeu5Ac-8OAc, respectively). As published in the literature,19 the H3eqNeu5Ac-7OAc signal includes both the 8OAc residues flanked
at their reducing side by an 8OAc residue and by a 7OAc residue. Because
H3eqNeu5Ac-7OAc overlaps with the H3eqNeu5Ac signals of MenW and MenY, the H3eqNeu5Ac-8OAc peak has been
selected for identity of MenC.

The 1H NMR profile
of Menveo vaccine, acquired by using
a diffusion filter pulse sequence to suppress the sucrose signals
(Figure 2), shows the
peaks of the four antigens used as identity probe signals for MenA,
MenC, MenW, and MenY antigens (Table 1).

Quantification of O-Acetyl
Content of the MenA
Antigen
The quantification of the OAc level allows for the
evaluation of the PS antigen conformity, which may also occur because
of adverse events which could provoke the release of O-acetyl groups. The MenA plain PS is largely O-acetylated at position
C3 (>90%) and slightly at position C4 (Figure 1).6,13 The
importance of OAc in MenA antigen immunogenicity has been confirmed
in preclinical study. Specific antibodies elicited in post-immunization
human sera mostly identified O-acetylated PS residues impacting the
degree of antibody inhibition. Comparative immunogenicity studies
in mice revealed that de-O-acetylated antigens resulted in a marked
loss of immunogenicity (total IgG) and, most relevantly, in their
ability to induce functional bactericidal antibodies.14 In a phase III partially blinded, controlled study [i.e.,
1170 healthy subjects aged 18–25 years were randomized (1:1:1)],
two lots of meningococcal ACWY-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT)
that differed in serogroup A PS OAc levels(68 vs 92% OAc), respectively,
were evaluated in terms of immunogenicity (i.e., rabbit serum bactericidal
activity) and safety in comparison to a licensed MenACWY PS vaccine
(82% serogroup A OAc). The MenA-TT conjugates with the OAc level of
68 and 92% resulted in comparable vaccine immunogenicity, considering
that, however, the vaccine population was seropositive at the time
of vaccination.15 As a matter of fact,
all the meningococcal serogroup A conjugates contained in licensed
vaccines (MenAfriVac—Serum Indian Institute; Menveo—GSK
Vaccines; Menactra—Sanofi Pasteur; Nimenrix—GSK Vaccines
later taken over by Pfizer) are largely O-acetylated. However, no
evidence has been collected to define the minimal OAc level affecting
the immunogenicity of meningococcal serogroup A vaccines so far.15

High relevance of O-acetyl
moieties of MenA PS could also be related to the presence of this
decorative group within the saccharide ring, probably influencing
and specifying the epitope in a unique arrangement that could not
be easily mimicked in its absence.16,17

For
the monovalent MenA PS and conjugate, the OAc content can be
estimated by integration of the H2ManNAc-3OAc peak (proton at position
C2 of ManNAc residues O-acetylated at C-3), H2ManNAc-4OAc peak (proton at position C2 of ManNAc residues O-acetylated
at C4), and H2ManNAc-deOAc peak (proton at position C2 of
ManNAc residues without OAc), in comparison to H1 ManNAc
(proton at position C1 of ManNAc residues). The total OAc
level can be obtained by the sum of H2ManNAc-3OAc and H2ManNAc-4OAc peak integration
as well as by integrating the H3/4ManNAc-3/4OAc peak.6 The same method already developed for the monovalent MenA
conjugate cannot be applied to the MenACWY combination vaccine as
the NMR profile exhibits large overlapping signals because ofthe presence
of the four antigens (Figure 2). However, the H1ManNAc peak at approximately 5.5 ppm, which
appears as a complex peak, is not affected by the presence of other
antigens. As reported in Figure 3a, the 1H–31P heteronuclear
multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) NMR spectrum provides a clear assignment
of different MenA residues, depending on different OAc patterns, terminal
residues, and so forth.

Figure 3 (a) 1H–31P HMBC
spectrum of the MenA-CRM197 sample; (b) 1H NMR
spectral window where H1MAnAc of MenA-antigen
resonates. The vertical bars show the integral regions identified
for measuring the OAc and non OAc forms. Labels to facilitate the
peak assignment are shown.

The H1ManNAc nuclear spin resonates at a slightly different frequency and correlates
with the diester phosphate group (the monoester phosphate signal falls
at higher chemical shift19), depending
from the specific magnetic environment generated by (a) presence of
the OAc group at position C3 or C4, (b) geminal
with the di-ester phosphate group of the open ring unit at reducing
end terminus (unit #2) (see Figure 1). The HMBC spectrum shows six 1H signals
(excluding the satellite peaks), originated by the scalar long–range
correlation (H–C–O–P) with diester 31P signals (separated peaks for OAc, −5.2 ppm, and non OAc,
−5.7 ppm, forms). As shown in Figure 3a, the proton at position C1 of
several ManNAc species O-acetylated at position C3 (3OAc)
or C4 (4OAc) or non-O-acetylated (deOAc) resonate at different
chemical shift values. From downfield to upfield, the signals H1a3OAc, H1a4OAc, H1adeOAc, H1b3OAc/H1b4OAc, H1c,d,edeOAc, H1bdeOAc resonate
in the sequence and some signals partially overlap each other.

As shown in Figure 3b, integral areas have been defined according to the assignment of
different H1ManAc species and also considering “operative” reasons (i.e.,
the presence of a valley at ∼5.46 ppm) related to the overall
peak shape. In essence, the OAc content has been calculated according
to the formula % OAc = H1OAc/H1 × 100, where H1 (range 5.52–5.34
ppm) is the sum of H1OAc (range 5.52–5.46 ppm) and H1deOAc (range 5.46–5.34 ppm)
peak integrals. Because the integration is performed in a restricted
spectral window (5.52–5.34 ppm), the noise baseline does not
affect the integral values significantly.

As compared to the
OAc content measured on the monovalent MenA
bulk conjugate by integrating the signals of protons at C2 (H23OAc, H24OAc, H2deOAc) and the protons
at C3/C4 positions (H3OAc + H4OAc) in comparison to protons at the C1 position,6 the method applied by dissecting
the H1ManNAc provides a lower estimation (Table 2).

Table 2 % OAc Estimated on a Monovalent MenA-CRM197 Sample by Integrating Different Signals: (a) % OAc = H1OAc/H1 × 100, Where H1 is the Sum of H1OAc and H1deOAc Peak Integrals; (b) % OAc = (H23OAc + H24OAc/H2) × 100, Where H2 is the Sum of H23OAc, H24OAc and H2deOAc Peak Integrals; (c) % OAc = (H3OAc + H4OAc/H1) × 100, Where H1 is the Sum of H1OAc and H1deOAc Peak Integrals (Figure 4)
 	H1	H3/H4 vs H1	H2	
% OAc	66	78	80	
Because of the partial overlapping
of the H1 signals
of OAc and non OAc forms, the integration strategy in the one-dimensional
spectrum results in under estimation of approximately 10% of OAc content
for the OAc level in the range of 70–80%. Essentially, some
of the OAc species are grouped with the non OAc form in the integral
measurement (Figure 3).

Conclusions
Novel applications for
the identity test and O-acetyl content estimation
of the MenA antigen in multivalent MenACWY
combination vaccines have been developed.

NMR-based identity
assay confirmed very high specificity and reproducibility
and should be considered as a suitable alternative to commonly used
non-specific and time-consuming colorimetric/chromatographic assays.

This NMR methodology can be readily adapted for use with other
bacterial PS preparations. For instance, it has the potential to be
applied on other licensed mono- and multivalent conjugate vaccines
against Haemophilus influenzae type
b (PedvaxHIB—Merck; ActHIB—Sanofi Aventis Pasteur; Hiberix—GSK
Vaccines), meningococcal (Menjugate, Menitorix—GSK Vaccines;
Menactra—Sanofi Pasteur; NeisVac-C, Nimenrix—Pfizer;
Meningitec—Nuron Biotech; MenAfriVac—Serum Indian Institute),
meningococcal/H. influenzae type b
(MenHibrix—GSK Vaccines), and pneumococcal (Prevnar, Prevnar13—Pfizer;
Synflorix—GSK Vaccines) infections.

A new method for
the estimation of OAc content of the MenA antigen
in Menveo-licensed vaccine, based on the integration of H1 signals in one-dimensional spectra, has been developed. Notably,
this NMR methodology can be also adopted for use with other vaccine
preparations potentially including protein antigens.

Materials and
Methods
The Menveo vaccine, as a two-vial presentation (monovalent
lyophilized
MenA-CRM197 and trivalent liquid MenC-, MenW-, and MenY-CRM197)9 as obtained from GSK Vaccines
Manufacturing.

NMR Samples Preparations
To prepare NMR analytical
samples, 10 vials of lyophilized MenA-CRM197 were reconstituted
with 10 vials of liquid MenCWY singularly. All the them were pooled
in 8 mL glass vial (Wheaton) and finally dried under vacuum.

A monovalent MenA-CRM197 sample was also prepared by drying
under vacuum approximately 1 mg of conjugate as the saccharide content.

The lyophilized contents were solubilized in 0.6 mL of deuterium
oxide (99.9 atom % deuterium; Aldrich), mixed to obtain a uniform
concentration, and subsequently transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube (Bruker).

NMR Measurements
Proton NMR experiments were recorded
on a Bruker AEON AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a high-precision
temperature controller using a 5 mm QCI CryoProbe (Bruker). TopSpin
software (Bruker) was used for data acquisition and processing.

1H NMR one dimensional spectra were collected at 600 MHz
and 25 ± 0.1 °C, with 32k data points over a 12 ppm spectral
width, accumulating a sufficient number of scans. The transmitter
was set at the water frequency, which was used as reference signal
(4.79 ppm).

To suppress the sucrose signals, which dominate
the spectrum because
of its large excess (i.e., >1500 molar fold) in comparison to the
MenACWY antigens, a diffusion filter pulse sequence (ledbpgp2s1d)
was applied by following an appropriate setting of the acquisition
parameters (i.e., gradient pulses, delays). The spectra were weighted
with 2.0 Hz line broadening and Fourier-transformed.

31P NMR one-dimensional spectra were recorded at 161.9
MHz at 25 ± 0.1 °C, with 32k data points over a 20 ppm spectral
width, accumulating an appropriate number of scans. The spectra were
weighted with 3.0 Hz line broadening and Fourier-transformed. Phosphoric
acid (85%) in deuterium oxide was used as external standard (0 ppm).

All the 1H and 31P NMR spectra were obtained
in a quantitative manner by using a total recycle time to ensure a
full recovery of each signal (5 × longitudinal relaxation time T1).

The 1H–31P two-dimensional HMBC NMR
experiment was recorded on the monovalent MenA-CRM197 sample
by a standard pulse program. 4096 and 512 data points were collected
in F2 and F1 dimension, respectively. A sufficient number of scans was accumulated
prior to Fourier transformation to yield a digital resolution of 0.2
and 3.0 Hz per point in F2 and F1, respectively.
