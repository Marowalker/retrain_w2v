A novel Salisbury screen absorber
(SSA) based on a 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4′-N′-methyl-stilbazolium
tosylate (DAST) crystalline film was designed and fabricated. Different
from the conventional SSA, an insulating organic DAST film replaced
the normally highly conductive top surface metal layer. The absorption
spectra and the structure of this SSA were optimized with a transmission
line model to correspond to the DAST absorption peak at 1.1 THz, whose
results were further verified by numerical simulations. If the thickness
of the DAST film is 4 μm, a nearly perfect terahertz (THz) absorption
is possible with this strategy, whereas the absorption of a bare 4
μm thick DAST film would be 4 times lower. The design allows
the terahertz response of this DAST system to be tuned by adjusting
either the thickness of the DAST film or the spacer, both of which
remain in deep sub-wavelength to broaden the range of applications.

1 Introduction
Terahertz
(THz) waves in the frequency range of 0.1–10 THz,
between infrared and millimeter waves, have many applications, such
as thermal emitters,1 terahertz imaging,2 communication,3 detectors,4 and filters.5 For
detection, imaging, and especially nonlinear optics, spectral-selective
THz absorption needs to be maximized. Many designs, such as metamaterial
absorbers,6−10 resistive frequency selective surface absorbers,11 and Salisbury screen absorbers (SSAs),12,13 demonstrate the general feasibility of enhanced absorption but not
necessarily the general suitability for tasks with different constraints.
For example, metamaterial absorbers, constructed by planar metallic
structures, can achieve perfect absorption near their resonance frequencies
but often come with the cost of a complicated fabrication process
and limited scalability. In contrast, SSAs are relatively simple and
readily scalable, excellent in performance, and relatively easy in
their manufacturing process. In terms of fabrication process, typical
structures of SSAs are similar to the three-layer metamaterial structures
but without the sub-wavelength lithographic patterning. They come
with a particular feature, namely, their top Salisbury surface is
made of highly conductive metal,13 CNTs,16 graphene,12 or other
materials, such as VOx and a-Si,14 for impedance matched to free space (e.g., 377
Ω).12 However, in the terahertz regime,
the thickness of the surface metal in a SSA should be controlled to
be at the nanometer scale for impedance matching, which is challenging
in large-scale fabrication of devices. Therefore, study results on
novel and feasible SSAs operating at terahertz frequencies will be
considerably attractive.

On the other hand, 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4′-N′-methyl-stilbazolium
tosylate (DAST) has become
one of the most important and successful organic nonlinear optical
materials since it was introduced in 1989.15 Although DAST is not conductive, like most organic crystals, hence
seemingly out of Salisbury Screen’s reach, its equivalent optical
conductivity that can be derived from its refractive index and extinction
coefficient16 is finite. At its strong
terahertz absorption frequency of 1.1 THz, corresponding to the anion–cation
pair vibration in the optical phonon mode,17 the optical conductivity of DAST is expected to be high. This suggests
the possibility of replacing the conductive materials on the top of
SSAs by DAST films and thus leading to a possible enhanced absorption
without increasing the thickness in a Salisbury configuration. Increasing
absorption without increasing thickness could be particularly meaningful
in the cases of nonlinear optics and thin-film flexible electronics,
e.g., applications of the DAST-based SSAs in rationally enhancing
the efficiency of the second-harmonic generation of DAST or in enhancing
the light absorption for the terahertz detectors, etc. Although graphene-based
SSAs have been shown to achieve near-perfect absorption in the terahertz
range,12 graphene is not known for its
optical nonlinearity. But according to the equation σt = 2ωε0nDκDt described in ref (16), it can be estimated that
the equivalent optical conductance of a 1 μm thick DAST film
at 1.1 THz is around 6.47 × 10–5 S, close to
that of a single-layer graphene (6.605 × 10–5 S).18 It therefore seems rational to
attempt to construct a DAST-based SSA to operate at around 1.1 THz,
as we set out to explore the feasibility in this work. However, in
such an attempt, one must also deal with the extra phase associated
with the likely finite DAST thickness and its anisotropy.

In
this work, a DAST-based SSA was designed and fabricated. Starting
with the conventional three-layer SSA structure, we investigated and
optimized its absorption performance by the transmission line model
(TLM). The TLM model provided a parametric insight in to the design
optimizations, results of which were further validated by numerical
simulations with the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) software.
Particularly, the as-simulated absorption spectra were also experimentally
compared.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Theoretical
Model
In transmission
line terminologies, the absorption of the wave of a wave vector k can be obtained as follows 1  where S11 is the
reflection coefficient, S21 is the transmission
coefficient, R = |S11|2 is the reflectivity, and T = |S21|2 is the transmittance. If the
thickness of the substrate metal exceeds the skin depth at terahertz,
the transmittance of the terahertz wave is zero, that is, T = |S21|2 = 0.

For broader applications, the DAST-based SSA was designed to be simple
in this work, as illustrated schematically in Figure 1a. More details about the design are shown
in the Experimental Section. For the designed
DAST-based SSA, the electromagnetic response can be modeled by the
equivalent transmission line as shown in Figure 1b, where ZL and Z are the impedances of the bottom Al layer and medium dielectric
spacer layer, respectively; d is the thickness of
the intermediate spacer layer; Z0 and Zin′ are the vacuum impedance and the impedance of the whole SSA, respectively;
and Rs is the equivalent optical sheet
resistance of DAST.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of the designed DAST-based
Salisbury
screen absorber and (b) its equivalent circuit model.

In theory, the combined impedance of the medium
dielectric layer
and the bottom metal layer can be expressed as19 2  where  is the magnitude of the wave vector, the
wavelength λ is the free space wavelength, n is the refractive index of the spacer region, and θ is the
incidence angle of light in the spacer region; under normal incidence,
θ = 0.

Aluminum (Al) metal is a perfect electric conductor
for the terahertz
waves. At a thickness much larger than the skin depth (about 120 nm
for Al at 1.1 THz),16 the incident terahertz
wave can not penetrate through the metal. In this case, the equivalent
impedance of the bottom Al layer for the designed SSA can therefore
be taken as 3  Then, the input impedance is 4  The final equivalent impedance
of the Salisbury
screen is 5  where ZR is the
impedance of the top DAST thin film.

Since DAST is an insulator,
it has only an equivalent optical conductivity
of16 6  where ω = 2πf and f is the frequency of the incident electromagnetic
wave; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity; and εr″ = 2nDκD, where εr″, nD, and κD are the frequency-
and polarization-dependent relative permittivity, refractive index,
and extinction coefficient of DAST, respectively. The equivalent optical
sheet resistance of DAST is given by16 7  where t is the thickness
of the top DAST film.

The reflection coefficient of the transmission
line and thereby
the absorbance of the DAST-based SSA under normal incidence condition
can be expressed as19 8  where Y0 is the
vacuum admittance and k is the wave vector. The absorption
spectra as functions of wavelength and thickness were investigated,
for polarization along DAST’s a-axis and b-axis, respectively.

2.2 Simulation
and Calculation
First,
we investigated the optimal structural parameters for the designed
DAST-based SSA. The simulation results on the effects of the thickness
of the space layer on the absorption of the DAST-based SSA are displayed
in Figure 2. The thickness
of the top DAST single-crystal film was set at 1 μm, whereas
the refractive index of the space layer was fixed at 1.38. The permittivities
of DAST film along the a- and b-axes
are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information. The method for the simulations of DAST-based SSA along
the a- and b-axes by CST is described
in the Experimental Section. As shown in Figure 2, if the thickness
of the space layer is smaller than 50 μm, both the absorptions
of the SSA along the a- and b-axes
increase with the increase of the thickness of the space layer. But
if the thickness of the space layer is larger than 50 μm, both
the absorptions along the a- and b-axes decrease, suggesting optimal terahertz absorption performance
observed at the spacer thickness of 50 μm. This also suggests
that the resonant frequency of the F–P cavity with the 50 μm
thick space layer corresponds to 1.1 THz. On the other hand, the optimal
spacer thickness can also be simply estimated through the lumped-element
TLM according to eq 8, where the maximum absorption is achieved at Y0 – 2ωε0nDκDt = 0 and nY0 cot(kd) = 0. For the intermediate
spacer layer, kd = π/2 implies that nd should be a quarter wavelength. When the resonance frequency
is set at the targeted frequency of 1.1 THz, an optimal spacer thickness
of 49 μm, close to that (50 μm) deduced by CST simulations
(Figure 2), was thus
estimated.

Figure 2 CST-simulated results at different thicknesses of the intermediate
spacer along the a-axis (a, b) and along the b-axis (c, d) of the top DAST single crystal, respectively.

Figure 2 also reveals
that the second absorption peak at ∼3 THz shifts to lower frequency
(red-shifts) with the increase of the thickness d of the intermediate spacer layer. The simulated absorption frequencies
near 3 THz under different spacer layer thicknesses are plotted in Figure 3. When the spacer
thickness is increased from 40 to 70 μm, the absorption peak
of the SSA near 3 THz red-shifts from 3.7 to 2.3 THz along the a-axis, whereas that along the b-axis red-shifts
from 3.6 to 2.3 THz. The red-shift of the peak at ∼3 THz can
be attributed to the effects of the F–P resonant absorption
mode. Since the thickness (1 μm) of the DAST single-crystal
film is much thinner than that (30–70 μm) of the spacer
layer, the optical path is mainly derived from the latter. Accordingly,
the F–P resonant frequency can be expressed as 9  where f is the frequency
of the absorption peak and d and n are the thickness and refractive index of the space layer, respectively. Equation 9 reveals that the
peak frequency is reciprocal to the thickness d of
the intermediate spacer layer, agreeing well with the simulated results
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Frequency of
the absorption peak near 3 THz at different spacer
thicknesses along the (a) a-axis and (b) b-axis of the top DAST crystal, respectively.

According to the above CST simulation results,
the optimal intermediate
spacer thickness was set as 50 μm. Accordingly, the effects
of the top DAST layer thickness on the absorption of the DAST-based
SSA were further investigated via both the CST simulation and TLM
calculation. For comparison, both the CST-simulated and TLM-calculated
spectra as a function of the thickness for the top DAST layer are
plotted in Figure 4. Figure 4 reveals
that two absorption peaks at 1.1 and 3.1 THz are observed along the a-axis whereas four absorption peaks at 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, and
3.0 THz appear along the b-axis.20 As the thickness of the DAST top layer is increased from
0.5 to 4 μm, both the absorptions polarized along the a- and b-axes are increased, and particularly,
a high absorption of ∼92.9% is seen along the a-axis at 4 μm (TLM results). As shown in Figure 4, the spectra in the 0–2 THz range
calculated by TLM are in good agreement with those simulated by CST.
However, the absorption peaks along the a-axis at
∼3 THz simulated by CST significantly shift to lower frequencies
as the DAST thickness increases whereas those along the b-axis only slightly shift (Figure 4). Rather differently, both the absorption peaks at
∼3 THz along the a- and b-axes calculated by TLM remain unchanged (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Absorption spectra of the SSAs under different
thicknesses for
the top DAST film along the (a) a-axis and (b) b-axis obtained by TLM calculations (dashed lines) and CST
simulations (solid lines), respectively.

In the CST simulations, the red-shift of the absorption peaks
at
∼3 THz is attributed to two factors: the great anisotropy of
the DAST (absorption coefficient of ∼100 cm–1 along the a-axis and that of ∼300 cm–1 along the b-axis near 3 THz)20 and the second resonant absorption mode at λ2 (∼λ1/3), as emerging from the F–P
cavity formed by the top DAST film and the bottom metal layer. This
resonance condition can be estimated analytically. Under normal incidence,
the phase difference of the round-trip optical path is 10  where n and d are the refractive index and thickness of the intermediate spacer
layer, nD and t are the
refractive index and thickness of the top surface DAST layer, and
φ0 is the phase change of light reflected from the
metal substrate, respectively. As the thickness t of the DAST film increases, the contribution of the DAST film to
the phase change becomes more and more important, especially relative
to the higher frequency (shorter wavelength) mode at ∼3 THz.
This leads to a significant red-shift of the peak along the a-axis at ∼3 THz with the increase of the thickness t of the DAST layer. However, DAST crystal exhibits a higher
absorption coefficient along the b-axis than along
the a-axis at ∼3 THz,20 suggesting that the absorption of the DAST-based SSA at ∼3
THz along the b-axis would be dominated by the intrinsic
absorption of DAST crystal, thus leading to only slight red-shifts
of the peak at ∼3 THz seen along the b-axis
(Figure 4b). The case
is different for the TLM calculations, where the DAST is lumped into
a single sheet resistance Rs without a
DAST layer thickness-dependent phase, and thus the absorption peaks
at ∼3 THz remain unchanged with the increase of the DAST thickness.

For assessing the enhancement extent of the absorption due to the
Salisbury strategy, the terahertz spectra simulated by CST for a 4
μm thick DAST single-crystal film and an SSA constructed by
a 4 μm thick DAST single-crystal film as the top surface layer
are compared in Figure 5. It shows that the absorptions at 1.1 THz for the as-designed SSA
along the a- and b-axes of DAST
crystal are 86.9 and 68.9%, about 3.4 and 4.4 times higher than those
for the bare DAST film with the same thickness, respectively.

spectra of a SSA constructed by a 4 μm thick
DAST single-crystal film and a bare 4 μm thick DAST single-crystal
film along the (a) a-axis and (b) b-axis of DAST crystal, respectively.

2.3 Experimental Results
According to
above TLM calculation and CST simulation results, we fabricated the
as-designed DAST-based SSAs. To overcome the difficulty in the preparation
of uniform DAST single crystal with a precise and desirable thickness,
DAST polycrystalline thin films were prepared in this work. Figure 6 shows the metallography
micrographs of the spray-coated DAST polycrystalline films with the
thicknesses of 2 and 4 μm, respectively, both of which were
used in the fabrication of the designed SSAs. Compared with the 2
μm thick DAST film (Figure 6a), the 4 μm thick DAST film (Figure 6b) is denser.

Figure 6 Metallographic micrographs
of (a) 2 μm and (b) 4 μm
thick DAST polycrystalline films spray-coated on the surfaces of Scotch
tape films, respectively.

The crystallinity of the as-prepared films was characterized
by
X-ray diffraction (XRD). Figure 7a indicates that four peaks, appearing at the diffraction
angles of ∼13.9, 16.8, 18.5, and 25.44°, respectively,
were detected from the DAST films. The two main peaks at 13.9 and
16.8° are assigned to the signals from the (1̅11) and (021)
crystal planes of DAST, whereas the other two ones at 18.5 and 25.44°
correspond to the signals from the (202̅) and (1̅31) crystal
planes of DAST, respectively.21 These XRD
patterns confirm that polycrystalline DAST films with high crystallinity
can be prepared by the simple spray-coating method.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
of the spray-coated DAST polycrystalline films with various film thicknesses.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
was employed to further investigate
the chemical structures of the films, results from which are shown
in Figure 7b. In the
IR spectra, the absorption peak at 3039 cm–1 is
assigned to the C=C vinyl C–H stretching mode, whereas
that at 1589 cm–1 corresponds to the vibrational
mode of the C=C and C–C.22,23 The absorption
peaks at 1530 and 1371 cm–1 are ascribed to the
C=C in the ring stretching mode and the vinyl C–H bending
mode, respectively.21 The absorption peaks
at 1181 and 825 cm–1 can be identified as the S=O
of the sulfonate group stretching mode and the aromatic ring vibrational
mode, respectively. The absorption peak at 561 cm–1 is due to the CH3 twisting mode.21,22 It is clear that the two films shown in Figure 6 exhibit similar mid-IR features (Figure 7b), both agreeing
well with those previously reported about the DAST-based materials.21,22 This verifies basic DAST structures for the spray-coated films in
this work. Moreover, IR measurements at different spots of the same
samples revealed that both the chemical structures and optical responses
are uniform, in accordance with the morphologic results (Figure 6).

The measured
terahertz spectra of the fabricated SSAs with the
respective DAST film thickness of 2 and 4 μm are displayed in Figure 8a. Two absorption
peaks at ∼1.1 and 1.4 THz, combined the contributions from
both the a-axis (1.1 THz)20 and the b-axis (1.1 and 1.3 THz)20 of single crystal in the prepared polycrystalline DAST
films, were experimentally observed over the range of 0.9–1.5
THz (Figure 8a). Particularly,
the peak at 1.4 THz in Figure 8a, assigned to the rotational vibration of anion along the a-axis in the optical phonon mode,17 corresponds to the calculated peak of DAST crystal along the b-axis at 1.3 THz (Figure 8b) and close to that (1.46 THz) previously measured
by FTIR.24 Further inspection indicates
that when the DAST film thickness is increased from 2 to 4 μm,
the measured absorption of the fabricated SSA at 1.1 THz is increased
from 29.8 to 66.8% (Figure 8a). In contrast, the peak absorption of the 4 μm thick
polycrystalline DAST film deposited on the Al substrate without the
SSA structure was measured to be 15.2% (Figure 8a). For comparison, the spectra of the SSA
simulated under the respective DAST thickness of 2 and 4 μm
are shown Figure 8b,
revealing that the averaged absorbance of the SSA along the a-axis and b-axis near 1.1 THz is increased
from 58.2 to 77.6% as the DAST thickness is increased from 2 to 4
μm. Both measured (Figure 8a) and simulated (Figure 8b) results confirm that the SSA structure
indeed can enhance the terahertz absorption even in the nonideal polycrystalline
phase of DAST formed by spray-deposition and annealing. These experimental
results demonstrate that organic SSA with high terahertz absorption
can be realized by a DAST film (Figure 8a), despite its being an insulator and countering the
usual expectation of a conductive surface for a SSA. It however does
not counter the underlying physics as a highly absorbing organic crystal
has its equivalent high optical conductivity, as expressed in eq 7. It is noted that perfect
100% absorption at 1.1 THz is not expected in this system as the phase
and amplitude conditions for a perfect impedance match are mutually
constrained here by the available range of the optical conductivity
and that of the DAST film thickness.

terahertz spectra

3 Conclusions
In this work, a novel THz SSA with a counterintuitive or unconventional
insulating organic DAST film as the surface absorbing and impedance
matching layer was designed and successfully fabricated. The absorption
properties of this DAST-based SSA were theoretically investigated
by an analytical TLM method and validated by numerical simulations
using commercial CST software. From both, one can expect the designed
DAST-based SSA to exhibit a strong structurally enhanced absorption
at 1.1 THz, which when successful will help broaden the reach of DAST
into regimes of applications where both high absorption efficiency
and thin and flexible form factors are needed. The TLM calculations
along the a-axis show that the SSA formed with 4
μm thick DAST film could operate as a nearly perfect absorber
with absorbance of 92.9% at 1.1 THz. The experimental measurements
show high absorption of 66.8% at 1.1 THz, in support of the theory
but suffering from the limitation of a polycrystalline film with mixed
contributions from both the a- and b-polarizations.

The enhanced terahertz absorption of a thin
DAST film in a SSA
structure comes with the advantage over the bulk crystal counterpart
in flexibility, scalability, simpler and easier fabrication, and ductility
for handling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
about such organic SSA. Although a DAST polycrystalline film is used
in the actual test, instead of the simpler and better single crystal
for modeling, it is expected that in future tests when precision fabrication
of DAST single-crystal film of a predetermined thickness becomes possible,
a higher terahertz absorption and better agreement with theory will
be achievable.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Design of the DAST-Based SSA
With
the strong terahertz absorption of DAST crystal at 1.1 THz, the optical
conductivity of DAST was estimated to be very high. On the basis of
this, we designed a novel SSA formed with a DAST film as the top layer,
the structure of which is completely different from that of the conventional
SSAs formed with highly conductive metals. In the designed SSA, the
top surface layer is a DAST single-crystal film, serving as both the
terahertz absorber and the impedance matcher with the free space.
Moreover, the bottom layer is a 200 nm thick Al film, which is thin
enough to remain flexible and thick enough to ensure a complete reflection
in terahertz. The intermediate layer is a common polymer, Scotch tape,
which is transparent in the terahertz region and serves as the dielectric
spacer layer for the SSA. It was reported that the resonance frequency
of the Scotch tape is near 1.0 THz, close to the absorption peak of
DAST crystal at 1.1 THz.25 Moreover, measurements
revealed that the Scotch tape used in this work has excellent transmittance,
exceeding 85% in the range of 0.2–3 THz (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Accordingly, this
Scotch tape was chosen as the intermediate dielectric spacer layer
for the designed DAST-based SSA (Figure 1a).

4.2 Simulations
The
finite-difference
time-domain algorithm of the CST Microwave Studio 2014 electromagnetic
simulation software was used for the simulations. As shown in Figure 1a, the incident electromagnetic
wave and its electric and magnetic fields are along the z, x, and y axes, respectively.
The frequency-dependent permittivities of DAST crystal along the a- and b-axes are shown in the Supporting Information. In the CST simulations,
the three-layer SSA structure, constructed by a bottom 200 nm thick
Al, an intermediate 50 μm thick spacer layer with a refractive
index of 1.38, and a top 1 μm thick DAST layer, was first established.
The simulation allows for adjusting either the thickness of the DAST
film or that of the spacer. Second, the real and imaginary parts of
the frequency-dependent permittivities of DAST along the a-axis and the b-axis (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) were imported into the CST
software, respectively. Finally, the terahertz absorption spectra
for DAST single crystal along the a-axis and the b-axis were simulated by CST, respectively.

4.3 Preparation of the DAST-Based SSA
First, 80 mg of DAST
powder was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol, and
then the solution was stirred with a glass rod and ultrasonically
treated for 3 h till a uniform DAST-methanol solution was yielded.
Second, a 200 nm thick Al film was deposited by magnetron sputtering
on a flexible Scotch tape (3M Utility Tape #522, 3M Corp.) with a
refractive index of 1.38 and a thickness of 51 μm, close to
the optimum value (50 μm) by simulations (Figure 2). Third, the DAST-methanol solution was
sprayed on the other side of this Scotch tape under the conditions
of 0.2 MPa air pressure, at a height of 20 cm, and spraying for 30
s. After spraying, the samples were heated at 60 °C for 5 min
for solidification. The processes were repeated till desirable thickness
of the DAST film was achieved. Finally, the samples were annealed
at 80 °C for 2 h in highly pure nitrogen gas for removing the
solvent and water.

4.4 Characterization
The terahertz spectra
of the bare DAST film and the DAST-based SSA were characterized by
terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TPS Spectra 3000, TeraView) and
Fourier infrared spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Spectrum 400), respectively.
The morphologies of the fabricated SSAs were imaged by a metallographic
microscope (MV 5000). The crystallinities of the films were characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Philips X’pertProMPD),
whereas the film thicknesses were measured by a step profilometer
(Ambios XP-300).
