Herein,
we report a new strategy based on jacalin functionalization
to diminish the impact of biological fluids in the antibacterial applications
of nanoparticles (NPs). Precoating pectin-capped copper sulfide NPs
(pCuS) with bovine serum albumin produced a protein corona, which
affects the antibacterial activity of pCuS. It was found that the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increases fourfold because
of the formation of the protein corona. Interestingly, the pCuS functionalized
with jacalin enhance the targeting capabilities through bacterial
cell surface glycan recognition with no interference from the protein
corona. The MIC of pCuS decreases 16-fold on functionalization with
jacalin. Mechanistic studies indicated that the pCuS functionalized
with jacalin impede the protein corona interference and induce bacterial
cell death by impairing the GSH/reactive oxygen species balance and
disrupting the bacteria cell membrane. As a proof of concept, we used
a bacteria-infected zebrafish animal model to demonstrate the interference
of biological fluids in the antibacterial activity of NPs. Infected
zebrafish treated with 1× MIC of pCuS failed to recover from
the infection, but 4× MIC rescues the fish. The requirement of
a high dose of NPs to treat the infection confirms the interference
of biological fluids in nanotherapeutic applications. At the same
time, the jacalin–pCuS complex rescues the infected fish at
16-fold lesser MIC. The results obtained from this study suggest that
jacalin-mediated NP targeting may have broad implications in the development
of future nanomedicine.

Introduction
Nanomaterials are believed
to be next generation molecules with
huge potential in diverse fields including medicine, catalysis, sensors,
and so forth.1−3 The concerns over the nanotoxicity and poorly understood
mechanism of action impede their development in health care.4 Moreover, the behavior of nanoparticles (NPs)
in biological fluids remains enigmatic. Recent studies suggest that
the surfaces of NPs are readily modified by proteins or other biomolecules
present in biological fluids.5 The adsorption
of the biomolecules leads to the formation of a shell on the NP surfaces,
which is called as “corona”. The formation of biomolecular
corona confers real physicochemical properties of the NPs in the biological
milieu.6,7 Biomolecular corona has a strong influence
on targeting efficacy, activity, biodistribution, clearance, and toxicity.8−10 The emerging evidence suggests that the protein coronas formed by
the plasma protein affect the uptake and distribution of NPs. Monteiro-Riviere
et al. showed that the uptake efficacy of silver NPs by HEK cells
was reduced because of the association of human serum albumin, IgG,
or transferrin.11 Lesniak et al. demonstrated
that silica NPs have a stronger adhesion to the cell membrane and
greater internalization efficiency in the absence of serum proteins.12 Hu et al. illustrated that the extremely high
protein adsorption ability of graphene oxide nanosheets caused reduced
cytotoxicity in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum.13 Thus, the challenge imposed by the protein corona
should be taken into account when evaluating the therapeutic potential
of the NPs.

Antibacterial activity of NPs have received a great
deal of attention
because of their proposed ability to combat multi-drug resistance
pathogens.14 To explore NPs as an antibacterial
agent, it is important to consider the interference from protein corona
and also find a method to mitigate the interference from biological
fluids. Silver NPs has been recognized as an antibacterial agent,
but the emerging evidence showed that silver has high toxicity as
compared to silver sulfide NPs.15,16 Similarly, the cost-effective
copper NPs have good antibacterial activity, but are highly toxic
when tested in zebrafish.17 Recently, copper
sulfide NPs (CuS NPs) have been intensively investigated in various
fields including antibacterial, photothermal cancer therapy, biomolecule
sensing, and molecular imaging.18 In this
study, we have analyzed the ability of pectin-capped CuS NPs (pCuS)
to form protein corona through studying the interaction between the
NPs and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The choice of BSA is made because
of its abundance in the serum and its ability to interact with NPs.19 Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis revealed
that the pCuS binds to BSA with good affinities that are comparable
to BSA–drug interactions reported in the literature. The NPs’
interaction with BSA results in the formation of protein corona on
NPs’ surface. The differences imposed on the NPs’ surface
leads to a substantial change in the antibacterial activity of pCuS.19

To mitigate the protein corona interference,
we explored functionalization
of the NPs with jacalin, a glycan-binding protein isolated from the
edible seeds of jackfruit. Jacalin is a 66 kDa tetrameric protein
with high specificity for galactose. The sugar specificity and exogenous
ligand binding properties of jacalin have been studied extensively.20 Jacalin in complex with anticancer phytomoleules,
shikonin, and silver NPs showed minimal requirement of the drug to
induce cell death in human chronic myeloid leukemia.21 PEG phthalocyanine-gold NPs conjugated with jacalin have
been employed to target specific glycans expressed on HT-29 colon
adenocarcinoma cells.22 The glycan recognition
properties of jacalin were reported for enhancing the antibacterial
activity of N-lauryl tyramine-capped CuS NPs (NLTA-CuS
NPs) against drug resistance bacteria.23 Herein, we demonstrated through a battery of biophysical and biochemical
methods that the interference from the protein corona on the antibacterial
activity of pCuS could be diminished by functionalizing the NPs with
jacalin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting
a novel method based on lectins to curtail the protein corona interference
in the antibacterial activity of NPs.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of Pectin-Capped Copper Sulfide NPs
pCuS
were synthesized by reacting copper NPs with sodium sulfide. It is
seen that the brown color copper NPs turn olive green and show the
characteristic broad band of CuS in the near infrared region, peaking
at 1080 nm (Figure 1A). The absorption peak was assigned to an electron-acceptor state
lying within the band gap.24,25 The loss of surface
plasmon resonance maximum at 580 nm of pCuNPs indicates the complete
conversion of CuNPs to pCuS. The absence of absorption peaks correspond
to the Cu2S phase at 475 nm, suggests that the preparation
has high-quality pCuS.26 The powder X-ray
diffraction of pCuS is shown in Figure S1A. The diffractions peaks at 2θ values of 21.63°, 27.48°,
29.35°, 31.50°, 32.45°, 47.58°, and 59.23 were
assigned to the (004), (101), (102), (103), (006), (107), and (116)
reflections. The diffraction pattern is matched with the diffraction
library of CuS (JCPDS 74-1234) and indexed for the single covellite
phase with a hexagonal crystalline structure. The broadening of the
diffraction peaks suggests the formation of nanodimensional particles.
Transmission electron microscope images revealed that the particles
are spherical with a size range from 2 to 10 nm (Figure 1B). The selected area diffraction
patterns account for the (1 0 2) and (1 0 3) lattice planes of a hexagonal
structure of pCuS (Figure S1B). Energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis revealed the presence of Cu and S in the preparation
(Figure S1C).

BSA–pCuS Interaction
The capability of BSA to
form a protein corona on pCuS surfaces was first evaluated through
the interaction studies. It is noted that the intrinsic fluorescence
of BSA was quenched by the addition of pCuS, suggesting the interaction
between BSA and pCuS (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Fluorescence titration. (A) Addition of pCuS to BSA quenches the
intrinsic fluorescence. Excitation wavelength = 280 nm. (B) Double
logarithmic plot for the interaction of pCuS with BSA. The abscissa
intercept of this plot yielded the pKa value of the BSA–pCuS interaction.

The mechanism of quenching may be static or dynamic; thus, we analyzed
the quenching data with the Stern–Volmer equation.27 1   2  where F0 and Fc are the relative fluorescence intensities
of BSA at 340 nm in the absence and presence of pCuS, respectively, Ksv is the Stern–Volmer fluorescence quenching
constant, Kq is the biomolecular quenching
constant, and τ0 is the average fluorescence lifetime
of BSA. From the linear Stern–Volmer plot, Ksv (7.577 × 103 M–1)
was determined (Figure S2A). The Kq (1.51 × 1012 L/mol s) calculated
for the BSA–pCuS interaction was higher than the Kq (1010 L/mol s) obtained for the diffusion-controlled
quenching process. These results suggest that the quenching process
is static and a nonfluorescent complex is likely formed between BSA
and pCuS. From the quenching study, the binding constant (Ka) was calculated by the following expression.28,29 3  where F∞ is the change in fluorescence intensity at infinite
pCuS concentration, n is the number of binding sites,
and Ka is the association constant. F∞ was obtained from the ordinate intercept
of the plot
of F0/ΔF∞ versus 1/[pCuS]. A double logarithmic plot for the interaction of
pCuS with BSA is shown in Figure 2B. The Ka calculated for
the BSA–pCuS interaction is 2.04 (±0.43) × 104 M–1, which is comparable to those observed
generally for BSA–drug interactions.30,31

The binding of BSA with pCuS was further characterized by
measuring
the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the BSA–pCuS
complex and pCuS. Compared to pCuS, the hydrodynamic diameter of the
BSA–pCuS complex increases from 122.6 to 162.4 nm (Figure S3). The increase in the size is attributed
to the presence of BSA coating (protein corona) on the NPs. The negative
zeta potential of pCuS (−21.3 mV) and the BSA–pCuS complex
(−17.4 mV) suggest that the surface were negatively charged
(Figure S4), though the BSA–pCuS
complex was lesser negative than pCuS. However, it is clear from this
study that the formation of BSA corona on the NPs’ surface
had no significant differences on the surface charge of the NPs.

BSA Interference on the Antibacterial Activity of pCuS
Having
studied the protein corona formation with pCuS, we set out
to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of pCuS to
kill Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive
(Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria by resazurin microtiter
assay (REMA). In this method, live cells appear pink in color because
of the reduction of resazurin to resarufin, whereas dead cells appear
blue in color because of lack of respiration.32 From Figure 3A, the
MIC of pCuS required to kill the bacteria was determined as 12.5 μM.
Strikingly, the addition of BSA to pCuS increases the MIC four-fold
from 12.5 to 50 μM, which indicates that the protein corona
formed by BSA interfered with the antibacterial activity. A further
evidence for the protein corona interference was evaluated by the
conventional zone of inhibition (ZOI) assay. Figure 3B shows the ZOI around the well loaded with
12.5 μM pCuS, but there is no zone formed around the well loaded
with the BSA–pCuS complex. The diameter of the zone formed
around the well treated alone with pCuS reflects the inhibition of
bacteria growth. These results are consistent with REMA and indicate
that the antibacterial activity of pCuS was hindered by the formation
of BSA corona.

Jacalin to Mitigate Protein Corona Interference
Previous
studies showed that jacalin improves the antibacterial activity of
NPs through recognizing bacterial cell surface glycan.23 Thus, we hypothesized that jacalin could also
diminish the interference from serum proteins. To test this hypothesis,
we evaluated the interaction between jacalin and pCuS using the intrinsic
fluorescence of jacalin. The titration of jacalin with pCuS is shown
in Figure S5A. The observed fluorescence
quenching caused by pCuS was attributed to the formation of the non-fluorescent
jacalin–pCuS complex. Analyzing the quenching data by the Stern–Volmer
plot yielded the Kq for the jacalin–pCuS
interaction as 1.38 × 1013 L/mol s, which suggests
that the quenching mechanism is static [Figure S5B]. Using eq 3, Ka calculated for the binding of jacalin
and pCuS is 1.91 (±0.62) × 104 M–1 [Figure S5C], which is comparable to
those observed for jacalin–sugar interaction and jacalin interaction
with other ligands.20 The interference
of pCuS with the glycan recognition site of jacalin was evaluated
by estimating the binding constant in the presence of specific sugar,
galactose [Figure S6]. The Ka value derived for the binding of jacalin and pCuS in
the presence of galactose is 1.41 (±0.36) × 104 M–1, which is in closer agreement with the Ka value estimated without galactose. These results
suggest that jacalin forms a stable complex with pCuS without affecting
the glycan recognition site. Having demonstrated the complex formation
between pCuS and jacalin without affecting the glycan binding site,
we set out to determine the influence of BSA on the MIC of jacalin–pCuS
(JpCuS) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by REMA.
The MIC of pCuS was determined in the presence of varying concentrations
of jacalin. It was noted that, about 50 μM jacalin is sufficient
to get the lowest MIC (Figure S7). The
MIC of JpCuS against E. coli is 0.78
μM, which is much lesser than the uncomplex pCuS, indicating
that the glycan recognition nature of jacalin improves the antibacterial
activity of pCuS at very low concentrations (Figures 4A and S8). It
is noteworthy that the MIC of JpCuS was not affected by the presence
of BSA, suggesting that jacalin diminished the serum protein interference
in the antibacterial activity of NPs. However, blocking the sugar
binding site of jacalin with galactose reverses the MIC from 0.78
to 25 μM, indicating the importance of a galactose-binding site
of jacalin for bacterial recognition.23

Figure 4 Representative
antibacterial activity of JpCuS against E. coli. (A) MIC discerned from REMA, and (B) ZOI
performed at (i) 12.5 μM JpCuS, (ii) BSA + 12.5 μM pCuS,
(iii) BSA + 12.5 μM JpCuS, and (iv) 12.5 μM JpCuS + galactose.
As noted, BSA has no interference with JpCuS, but galactose interferes
with the antibacterial activity of JpCuS. BSA—50 μM;
jacalin—50 μM.

Additionally, the ZOI experiment showed a nearly equal zone around
the well loaded with either JpCuS or JpCuS containing BSA (Figure 4B). Unlike JpCuS,
the galactose-containing JpCuS were unable to inhibit the proliferation
of E. coli at the MIC of pCuS (Figure 4B), complementing
the results of REMA. A similar trend was observed for P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, and S. aureus with JpCuS. In all
cases, the MIC of pCuS was lowered by 16-fold on complexing with jacalin
(Table S1). However, the addition of galactose
to JpCuS hinders their antibacterial efficacy, as evidenced by the
MIC reversal (Table S1). It is noteworthy
that the diameter of the zone observed with JpCuS is bigger than pCuS,
indicating superior activity [Table 1]. The most reasonable explanation for the higher antibacterial
of JpCuS is attributed to the increase in recognizing bacteria cell
surface through the jacalin sugar-binding site. Our findings were
consistent with the previous study where jacalin-functionalized NLTA-CuS
NPs were more toxic to the tested bacterial strains than NLTA-CuS
NPs.23 Taken together, our study signifies
the importance of jacalin to mitigate the protein corona interference
and also derive higher efficacy from pCuS against the tested bacterial
strains.

Antibacterial
Mechanism
To understand the antibacterial
mechanism of the pCuS, we first examine the membrane integrity of
the bacteria using acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) dual
staining method. AO is a cell membrane-permeable dye that binds to
all nucleic acid and fluoresces green, whereas PI is a membrane impermeable
dye that only enters into dead cells with compromised membranes and
fluoresces red.33

To analyze the
membrane integrity, we treated bacteria with different compositions
of NPs at the MIC of pCuS for 3 h, followed by AO/PI staining to examine
the integrity of the bacteria membrane. As shown in Figure 5, bacteria without NPs treatment
fluoresces green, indicating that the membrane was seen as intact
and cells are live. The cells treated with 12.5 μM pCuS fluoresces
red, suggesting the integrity of the membrane was indeed disturbed
and cells are killed by pCuS. However, the cells treated with 12.5
μM pCuS–BSA complexes shows green fluorescence, indicating
that the BSA coating on the NPs’ surface passivates the interaction
of pCuS and bacterial membranes, leading to decreased membrane disruption.
Interestingly, strong red fluorescence was observed from the cells
treated with pCuS–jacalin complexes even in the presence of
BSA, suggesting that jacalin diminishes the protein corona interference
and facilitates pCuS to disrupt the membranes. Additional evidence
for the membrane damages was confirmed by a scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) study [Figure S9].

integrity assay. E. coli was treated
with NPs, followed by staining with AO/PI and imaged
in fluorescence microscopy. Untreated cells serve as negative (−)
control and cells treated with Triton X100 served as positive (+)
control. Red fluorescence indicates that cells have compromised membranes.
BSA—50 μM; jacalin—50 μM. Magnification—100×.

The loss of membrane integrity may not be the only
antibacterial
mechanism; thus, we examined the oxidative stress caused by pCuS.
Oxidative stress refers to excessive generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) that cause damage to membranes, proteins, and DNA.33 Having observed the membrane damage, we analyzed
the ROS production by dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) method. The NP-induced ROS production by bacterial cells can
oxidize the H2DCFDA to green fluorescent dichlorofluorescein
(DCF).33 As shown in Figure 6, we only observed strong green fluorescence
from bacterial cells treated with pCuS and not from pCuS–BSA,
indicating the pCuS-induced ROS generation was prevented by the BSA
corona. Remarkably, the addition of jacalin to pCuS overcomes the
protein corona interference and generates excess ROS to oxidize H2DCFDA to green fluorescent DCF. In a biological system, ROS
generation and clearance are well orchestrated by redox enzymes. Reduced
glutathione (GSH) is an important antioxidant tripeptide that protects
the cells from oxidative stress by scavenging ROS.34,35 Hence, the total GSH levels in the cells treated with pCuS were
quantified by the (dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) method.35 As shown in Figure S10, the amount of GSH depleted largely in the cells treated with pCuS
and JpCuS as compared to the cells treated with BSA–pCuS, indicating
that the JpCuS trigger extensive ROS generation and deplete the antioxidant
GSH level. These observations correlate well with membrane integrity
studies where JpCuS shows excellent membrane damaging activities even
in the presence of BSA (Figure 6). Collectively, our study demonstrated that JpCuS induces
bacterial cell death independent of the interference from protein
corona by impairing GSH/ROS balance and damaging the bacteria cell
membrane.

and imaged in fluorescence microscopy. Untreated cells serve as negative
(−) control and cells treated with 12.5 μM H2O2 served as positive (+) control. Green fluorescence
indicates the generation of excess ROS by treated cells. BSA—50
μM; jacalin—50 μM. Magnification—100×.

In Vivo Study
Zebrafish is a good
animal model for
preliminary drug testing because 80% of zebrafish genome resembles
that of humans.36,37 To prove that biological fluids
interfere with therapeutic efficacy of NPs, we studied the antibacterial
activity of pCuS against E. coli-infected
zebrafish. About 30 animals were intramuscularly infected with E. coli and divided into three groups. Group A serves
as infected control. After 3 h of infection, Group B and Group C were
treated with pCuS. According to REMA data, the MIC of pCuS increase
four-fold in the presence of serum albumin. Thus, the Group B infected
fish were treated with 1× MIC (12.5 μM) and Group C infected
fish were treated with 4× MIC (50 μM). It is noted that
Group C fish survived because of treatment, whereas Group A and Group
B succumbed to the infection in 8–10 h. Bacterial load in each
group at different time points after infection and treatment was determined
by the LB-agar plate method. As shown in Figure 7A, a higher number of bacterial colonies
were observed in Group A at 6 and 9 h of infection. At the same time,
Group B fish treated with 1× MIC showed small decrement in the
bacterial colonies at 6 and 9 h, but not as less as Group C. Hence,
the severity of the infections in Group A and Group B kills the animal.
It is noteworthy that 1× MIC pCuS is insufficient to decrease
the bacterial load drastically, suggesting that the biological fluids
prevent the action of NPs. However, treatment with high dose (4×
MIC) can overcome the interference from biological fluids and rescue
the fish by eliminating the bacterial load over time (Figure 7A). These results are consistent
with the above in vitro analysis.

Figure 7 In vivo study. (A) Treatment of E. coli-infected zebrafish with pCuS. Group A—no
treatment, Group
B—treated with 1× MIC pCuS, and Group C—treated
with 4× MIC pCuS. Because of infection, fish died after 9 h in
Group A and Group B and not available (NA) for the assay. (B) Treatment
of E. coli-infected zebrafish with
0.78 μM JpCuS. Muscle tissues were collected at different time
points and cultured on an LB-agar plate. The number of colonies formed
in the plate were calculated and reported in cfu.

In order to demonstrate the jacalin ability to diminish the biological
fluids’ interference, we treated the infected zebrafish with
0.78 μM of JpCuS. Strikingly, the treated fish survive the infection
and restore the animal to normal life. Bacterial colony count assay
revealed that the bacterial load was drastically eliminated over time
as a result of treatment with JpCuS [Figure 7B]. It is noteworthy that the concentration
of JpCuS used in the treatment was 16-fold lesser than the MIC of
pCuS, suggesting that the pCuS exhibits superior antibacterial activity
as a result of jacalin functionalization.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we found that pCuS have good antibacterial activity
against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. However, their efficiency
was impaired in the presence of serum protein. To mitigate the interference
of biomolecules like serum protein, we developed a strategy based
on the lectin, jacalin. The results suggest that jacalin empowers
the pCuS to attach to the bacterial membranes irrespective of the
interference from BSA and exert superior antibacterial activity. A
mechanistic study revealed that the bacterial cell death was a result
of loss of membrane integrity and weakened GSH/ROS balance. Additionally,
to demonstrate the antibacterial activity of JCuS NPs in complex biological
medium, a bacteria-infected zebrafish model has been proposed, where
the biomolecules interference was predicted. It was proven that pCuS
is insufficient to rescue the fish at 1× MIC, because of the
biomolecular interference. However, JCuS NPs could reduce the bacterial
load and rescues the fish at 16-fold lower MIC. The results from this
study may open the way toward the design of NPs with lectins to overcome
the interference of biomolecules in nanomedicine.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Copper Sulfide NPs
Briefly, for the synthesis
of copper sulfide NPs, 50 mg of pectin and 1 mM CuCl2 was
dissolved in 50 mL of double distilled water. Then, 200 μL of
ammonium hydroxide solution was added to form blue color copper–ammonia
complex. After 5 min, 400 μL of hydrazine hydride was added
and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature
for another 3 h. The appearance of reddish-brown color indicates the
formation of copper NPs. After that, 1 mM Na2S was added
to react with copper NPs. The solution changed from reddish-brown
to olive green color in 3 h, indicating the formation of pCuS.

Characterization
UV–vis spectroscopy of the
NPs was monitored by a Jasco-UV–visible–NIR spectrophotometer
from 400 to 1300 nm. The crystalline nature of pCuS was characterized
by an XRD-Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using monochromatic
Cu Kα radiation. High-resolution transmission electron microscope
(Tecnai, G2 20 S-Twin) image was recorded with NPs deposited onto
the copper grid at room temperature. Hydrodynamic size and zeta potential
of the samples were measured by a Malvern zetasizer version 6.20.

Interaction Studies
Jacalin for interaction studies
was purified from the seeds of jackfruit using the reported procedure
and their purity confirmed by SDS-PAGE and their activity by hemeagglutination
assay. Fatty acid free BSA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein
solution was prepared in PBS buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 7.4). All the interaction studies were performed with the
protein samples of OD280 ≈ 0.1. The intrinsic fluorescence
of the proteins was recorded on a JASCO-FP8200 spectrofluorimeter.
The excitation was set at 280 nm and the emission was recorded from
300 to 400 nm. Interaction studied was carried out by titrating 3
mL of protein solution with small aliquots of pCuS (1 mM). The change
in the fluorescence because of binding was measured after an equilibration
period of 2 min. All titrations were performed in triplicate to arrive
at average values.

Antibacterial Activity
The sample
of pCuS with BSA
or jacalin was prepared by incubating the NPs with 50 μM of
proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. The strains used for antibacterial
studies are Gram negative (E. coli—MTCC723; P. aeruginosa—MTCC1688) and Gram positive
(S. aureus—MTCC3160; B. subtilis—MTCC441). Typically, bacteria
were grown in LB media and tested as reported in our previous paper.23 The
MIC of NPs was assessed from REMA. Briefly, 100 μL of NPs (100
μM) was added into a 96-well plate and serially diluted. About
100 μL of bacteria (1 × 105 cfu/mL) was added
to each well and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Then, 30 μL
of resazurin solution (0.01 % wt/vol) was added to each well and cultured
further for 2 h at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity in each
well was measured by fluorescence microplate reader (Biotech, synergy
H1, Japan), where the excitation and emission were set at 530 and
580 nm, respectively. The antibacterial activity of the NPs was further
evaluated by the ZOI method. Briefly, log phase bacterial culture
was swabbed uniformly on LB agar plates using sterile cotton swabs.
About 10 mm diameter wells were created using gel puncture and the
wells were loaded with defined concentrations of the NPs. The plates
were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The formation of zones around
the well was measured with a ruler.

Membrane Integrity
The integrity of the bacterial membrane
was judged by a dual-staining method using the fluorescence probe,
AO and PI. Briefly, 1 × 105 cfu/mL was cultured with
a defined concentration of NPs for 12 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells
were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C
and stained with AO and PI for 2 h in the dark. About 10 μL
of the stained cells was placed on a glass slide with a coverslip
and imaged under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse). Green
and red filters were used for AO and PI, respectively. Cells treated
with TritonX-100 were used as the positive control.

Generation
of Reactive Oxygen Species
ROS generation
was assessed by the fluorescence probe, dichlorofluorescein diacetate
(DCFH2-DA). Briefly, 1 × 105 cfu/mL was
cultured with a defined concentration of NPs for 12 h at 37 °C.
Then, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 3
min at 4 °C and treated with DCFH2-DA for 30 min in
the dark. About 10 μL of the treated cells was placed on a glass
slide with a coverslip and imaged under a fluorescence microscope
(Nikon Eclipse). A green filter were used to image cells with excess
ROS. Cells treated with H2O2 were used as the
positive control.

Animal Study
The interference of
the biological fluids
in the therapeutic activity of the NPs was tested using a zebrafish
model. Healthy adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) weighing ∼300 mg were procured from the local aquarium and
allowed to acclimatize in the lab environment for 1 week. Bacterial
infections to zebrafish were done as reported in our previous paper.37 Briefly, 10 μL of 0.1 OD660nm bacteria cultures was injected intramuscularly and the infection
allowed to spread for the next 3 h. Then, the fish was divided into
three groups. Group A serves as an infected control, Group B was treated
through injecting intramuscularly 10 μL of 12.5 μM pCuS.
Group C was treated through injecting intramuscularly 10 μL
of 50 μM pCuS. At a defined time point, fish from each group
were sacrificed and the muscle tissue was dissected and homogenized
in 1 mL of PBS buffer. The homogenate was diluted 104 times
and plated in triplicate on sterile LB-agar plates. The number of
bacterial colonies formed was counted manually after 24 h of incubation
at 37 °C. In parallel to this experiment, about 10 infected fish
were treated with 0.78 μM JpCuS. The bacterial load in the muscle
tissue was determined as described above. All animal experiments were
performed in compliance with the CPCSEA guidelines for laboratory
animal facilities (Central Act 26 of 1982) and approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethics Committee (CPCSEA-493/SASTRA/IAEC/RPP) of SASTRA Deemed
University, India.
