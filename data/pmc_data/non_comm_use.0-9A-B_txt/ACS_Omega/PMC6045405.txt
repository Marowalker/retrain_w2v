Liquid crystalline hydrogels (LCGs)
with layer structures and oriented
pores were created using sacran which is a cyanobacterial heteropolysaccharide
possessing functional sulfate, carboxylate, and amide groups in common
with glycosaminoglycan. The LCG biocompatibility with L929 mouse fibroblasts
was confirmed under the appropriate conditions. Enhanced growth and
proliferation of L929 cells without exhibiting any toxicity were confirmed.
The water contact angle and protein adsorption ability on the LCG
were well-controlled by the cross-linking degree. Additionally, fibroblasts
were finely oriented on the LCG side face where layer edges made a
striped morphology on its surface, whereas the flat top faces of the
LCG did not induce any specific cell orientation.

Introduction
Hydrogels are three-dimensional
polymer networks capable of absorbing
a large amount of biological liquids such as water or saline while
maintaining their structural similarity.1,2 They can be
applied in a variety of fields such as cell carriers,3−5 drug delivery,6,7 and engineering scaffolds8−10 if they have biological compatibility11 and good cellular function.12−15 Cell controllable scaffolds are important biomaterials
which lead to the next-generation field of tissue engineering. Elements
of the scaffold architecture such as pore size, porosity, pore interconnectivity,
and media permeability are key factors in controlling cell activity.16,17

Previously, we prepared tough and porous hydrogels, in which
interconnected
pores resembling tunnels were perforated only in the side faces, by
using the bioderived megamolecule, sacran,18 which is an exopolysaccharide (Mw =
1.6 × 107 g/mol),19,20 extracted
from Aphanothece sacrum cyanobacteria
(Figure S1). Sacran is mainly composed
of sugar residues of Glc, Gal, Man, Xyl, Rha, and Fuc and functional
monosaccharides such as uronic acids and N-acetylated
amino sugars, some of which are sulfonated. As a result, sacran has
functional groups of carboxyls, sulfates, and amides, which is similar
to glycosaminoglycan (GAG). GAG exists in the extracellular matrix
and directly attaches to cell surfaces in animal tissues.21 Similarly, sacran chains surround A. sacrum cells as a main constituent of the extracellular
matrix. Thus, we believe that the sacran hydrogels were proper candidates
for scaffold constituents.

Herein, we exploited the opportunity
to use sacran hydrogels in
the tissue engineering field and found that L929 mouse fibroblasts
were well-extended on the hydrogels. In addition, we showed a face-selective
cell orientation on the sacran liquid crystalline hydrogel (LCG).

Results
and Discussion
Surface Properties
Sacran LCG scaffolds
were fabricated
by using a previously reported method.18 The sacran liquid crystalline solution (0.5 w/v %) was cast at 60
°C and then thermally cross-linked at 100, 120, and 140 °C. Figure 1 shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the films, revealing the layered
pattern on the side faces yet no specific patterns on the top faces
of the films. Afterward, the films were swollen in distilled water
and freeze-dried to form porous structures (Figure 1: inset). The pores, which were found in
the SEM images of the side faces but not in those of the top faces,
were interconnected along the direction of the layers like tunnels.
The shape of the surface was analyzed using ImageJ software, which
revealed the space between layers as 65 ± 21, 20 ± 3, and
11 ± 2 μm for samples cross-linked at 100, 120, and 140
°C, respectively. However, the pore sizes were 26, 19, and 9
μm for those samples.18

Figure 1 SEM images
of layered films (whose dimension shown above images)
prepared by casting of 0.5 w/v % sacran solution and annealed at 100,
120, and 140 °C. Images revealed layered patterns on side faces,
whereas no specific pattern on the top face. Inset: Porous scaffolds
prepared by freeze-drying of layered films (scale bars in insets:
200 mm).

Water contact angle (WCA) was
measured to evaluate the wettability
on the top surface of dry porous scaffolds. Wettability is an important
characteristic of scaffolds and is used to investigate cell behaviors
on the materials.22 From the literature,
moderate wettability (∼50°) of the surface from hydrophobicity
to hydrophilicity is preferred for the adhesion of cells.23Figure 2a shows that the WCA of the scaffold cross-linked at 100 °C
showed the highest value (95°) and gradually decreased down to
78° for the cross-linking treatment at 120 °C. On the other
hand, the WCA was drastically reduced to 37° for the 140 °C
treatment. Even though the side surface impacted to cell adhesion,
small thickness cannot measure the WCA. The thicknesses were 476 ±
14, 454 ± 46, and 242 ± 8 μm for annealing temperatures
at 100, 120, and 140 °C, respectively. The result indicated that
the hydrophilicity of the LCG surface increased with an increase in
the annealing temperature might be attributed to the loss of hydroxyls
and carboxyls by thermal esterification as demonstrated previously.18,24 These results indicated that the surface wettability of the sacran
scaffold could be simply controlled by changing the cross-linking
temperature. Moreover, as seen in the SEM images in Figure 1, the top surface of the film
was smoother when the annealing temperature was higher. The surface
profile was analyzed from SEM images using the ImageJ software result
in Figure S2. The surface of LCG scaffolds
cross-linked at 100 °C has the highest frequency that refers
to the roughness. The surface profile became smoother on the surface
of the samples cross-linked at 120 and 140 °C. In reality, it
was difficult for water droplets to remain still at a point on the
film annealed at 140 °C25 which was
the smoothest scaffold.

prepared by freeze-drying

°C. (A) WCAs on the x–y surface of scaffolds. (B) Protein adsorption degree to scaffolds
(mg/mg) after 24 h application. Values are averaged data (n = 5), and error bars refer to standard deviation.

Adsorption capability of serum
proteins to sacran chains has a
vital role in scaffolds because fibronectin, a presentative protein,
has a function of promoting cell adhesion and of reorganizing the
actin filaments.26Figure 2b shows the protein adsorption degree (μg/mg)
to the sacran LCG. The amount of adsorbed protein was decreased as
the cross-linking temperature increased because of the LCG morphology.
The LCG prepared after film annealing at a higher temperature had
a smaller pore size and lower porosity and had a smaller amount of
free functional groups such as hydroxyls and carboxyls which can efficiently
bind with protein.27 This result provided
important evidence of the control of cell activity on the sacran LCG
as a tissue engineering scaffold.

Cell Cultivation
The ability of scaffolds to control
cell adhesion and proliferation is crucial for tissue engineering
applications. L929 mouse fibroblasts were used to evaluate the cell–matrix
interaction in the sacran LCG. After cell cultivation, we took SEM
images of cells on the LCG to evaluate the cell compatibility of the
sacran scaffolds (Figure 3). SEM images demonstrated that a number of cells were attached
to both the top and side surfaces of the scaffolds and exhibited an
elongated shape, revealing the good biocompatibility of sacran LCG
scaffolds. This observation was supported by the live and dead assay
using fluorescent microscopy (Figure 4). The fluorescent image of fibroblast L929 cells after
72 h incubation showed that almost all of the cells were colored green,
that is, alive, and only a few were red, that is, dead, strongly suggesting
the high cell compatibility of the sacran chains. The cell viability
was detected by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) to characterize the
proliferation of L929 cells on the sacran scaffolds. Figure S4a shows the absorbance values obtained after 3 days
of incubation. At the first day of cell culture, the number of cells
on scaffolds increased with an increase in the annealing temperature
of the precursor films from 100 to 140 °C. After 2 days of incubation,
the number of cells on the scaffold was increased but the values showed
a peak at an annealing temperature of 120 °C. The number of cells
on the scaffold from the film annealed at 140 °C was lower after
3 days of incubation, presumably because of excessive hydrophobicity
of the samples at 140 °C. In addition, the particularly narrow
area of the side surface and low protein adsorption ability might
be related to the low number of cells adhered to the samples at 140
°C. As a whole, the LCG scaffolds from the sacran films annealed
at 100 and 120 °C were more suitable for cell cultivation than
the LCG from the film annealed at 140 °C. Figure S4b shows the density of cells on the top and side
surfaces of the LCG, analyzed using SEM images (Figure 3) of cells on the scaffolds cultured for
3 days. The density of cells on the top surface was higher than that
on the side surface for all three samples. However, the cell density
on the top surface correlates well with the protein adsorption degree
on the scaffolds in Figure 2b. Although the side surface area was smaller than the top,
the number of cells on the side was affected. Because of the porous
morphology of materials, the rough surface was the main condition
for cell adhesion, thus many cells attached onto the side surface.28 Furthermore, the tendency of protein adsorption
corresponded to the number of attached cells.

taken after incubation for 3 days
on LCG scaffolds, which were annealed at 100, 120, and 140 °C.

cells to the x-axis (or y-axis)
on LCG scaffolds annealed at 100, 120, and 140 °C. (A) Schematic
illustration of cell distribution. (B–D) revealed the random
distribution of cells on the top surface of LCG scaffolds annealed
at 100, 120, and 140 °C, respectively, whereas (D–F) were
unidirection orientation of cell on the side surface of those sample.

The morphology of cells attached
on the top and side surfaces was
different. On the side surface, cells were extended along layers of
the LCG scaffolds, indicating that the surface structure of the LCG
materials can play a significant role in the cell attachment and proliferation.29 To quantify the orientation of L929 cells in
response to the layered structure of the LCG scaffolds, we analyzed
the angle of the extension direction of cells to the central line
between the top and bottom edges of the side surface as a reference,
from SEM images in Figure 3. The orientation angle ranged from −90° to +90°
and an orientation angle of 0° represent parallel alignment to
the reference line. Figure 4 demonstrates that almost all of the cells on the side surfaces
were within ±30°, meaning good orientation behavior. On
the other hand, L929 cells were randomly extended on the top surface
because of the LCG scaffolds not presenting any directing morphology
guiding the cell alignment. The orientation degree increased with
the annealing temperature of the precursor films; 63% of cells aligned
finely within ±15° on the LCG from the film annealed at
100 °C, whereas the figure was 80% at 120 °C and 92% at
140 °C. This tendency of layer structural ordering is in agreement
with a previous report.18 Then, the increase
in the annealing temperature created the sacran scaffolds with a high
orientation of layer stripes to introduce efficiently the orientation
of fibroblast cells. These results revealed that cell orientation
behavior was well-controlled by the layer structure, selectively on
the side surface. These unique characteristics of the sacran LCG scaffold
may lead to the oriented organization of artificial tissue.

Conclusions
It was demonstrated that the sacran LCG scaffolds with an anisotropic
porous structure were excellent materials for tissue engineering applications.
They showed a layered pattern on pores which could guide the cell
adhesion behavior. Surface properties such as the WCA presented the
proper condition from 95 to 37°. Proteins were well bound to
the sacran LCG surfaces presumably owing to the chemical structure
including functional groups such as hydroxyls and carboxyls. Both
the WCA and protein adsorption were controlled by the thermal cross-linking
temperature. We can speculate that the sacran scaffolds had good biocompatibility
thanks to their structural similarity to GAG in native tissue. The
most important function of the sacran LCG is that induction of fibroblast
orientation on the side surface having layer edges and the orientation
can be controlled by changing the hydrogel preparation condition.
Thus, sacran porous LCG materials have good biocompatibility and are
promising biomaterials for tissue engineering scaffolds.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Sacran was dedicated from Green Science Materials
Inc. (Kumamoto, Japan) and used as received.

LCG Scaffold Fabrication
LCGs were prepared by freeze-drying
of hydrogels which were fabricated by the solvent casting process
as reported before.18 Briefly, 50 mL of
0.5 w/v % sacran solution was casted on a polypropylene case (50 ×
50 × 50 mm3) and dried in an oven at 60 °C for
24 h to form translucent films. The films were thermally treated at
100, 120, and 140 °C, for 6 h to cross-link the sacran chains
in a dry film state. When the films were immersed in deionized water
at room temperature for 24 h, they became equilibrium-state hydrogels.
Next, sacran hydrogels were frozen by keeping in liquid nitrogen for
about 10 min and then drying in a freeze-drying apparatus (EYELA,
FDU-1200) for 72 h to form LCG scaffolds.

Characterization of Sacran
Scaffolds
To investigate
the surface morphology, the microscopy images were examined using
SEM (JEOL, JCM-6000PLUS). The samples were mounted onto metal stubs
using a carbon tape. The stubs were then coated with gold using a
sputter coater machine. Then, the ImageJ software was used to analyze
the surface profile and the space between layers.

The WCA experiment
of the sacran scaffolds was performed on the top surface using a contact
angle meter (Drop Master, Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd., Japan)
at room temperature.

To measure the protein adsorption, LCG
scaffolds were placed in
a 96-well plate having Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. After incubation, the scaffolds were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution thrice. The washed scaffolds were then incubated
with the 2 w/v % sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (Wako, Japan) at
room temperature for 3 h. Total protein was calculated using the bicinchoninic
acid assay.30

Cell Culture
A
mouse fibroblast-like cell line (L929)
was selected for all biological assays to evaluate the biocompatibility
and cell adhesion behavior on LCG scaffolds. The L929 fibroblast cell
line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). The cells were cultured in the DMEM (Sigma, USA) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Biochrom AG, Germany) incubated at
37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.

Cell Adhesion
Prior to biological assays, all LCG scaffolds
were sterilized under UV radiation overnight28 and then immersed in ethanol 70% (v/v) for 3 days. Subsequently,
1 mL of 1.0 × 105 cells·mL–1 cell suspension was seeded on each LCG scaffolds and cultured for
1, 2, and 3 days at 37 °C. After each incubation period, the
samples were rinsed with a buffer saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
The number of cells adhering to the scaffold was then counted.

Proliferation
Assay31
CCK-8
(Dojindo, Japan) was applied to evaluate the cell number according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. Each LCG, after rinse with
PBS, was incubated in 0.1 mL of the growth medium supplemented with
10 μL of CCK-8 stock solution for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2, in air. The absorbance at 450 nm
was measured.

Cell Morphology
The morphology of
the cultured L929
(1.0 × 105 cell/scaffold) was observed by SEM images.
After 3 days of culture, the cells were fixed by 10% formalin neutral
buffer solution (Wako, Japan) for 24 h. The dehydration process was
performed on each specimen in ethanol (60, 70, 80, 90, 100, and 100%)
and two times of t-butanol, each for 1 h, which is
then dried at room temperature. After that, they were sputter-coated
with gold and viewed by SEM. The orientation degree of extended cells
was measured using ImageJ software. A reference line was set along
the central line of upper and lower edges in an SEM image, and then
the orientation angle to the reference line was evaluated.32

Live/Dead Assay9,31
Cell
viability in sacran
LCG scaffolds was evaluated using the live/dead assay. Constructs
were harvested, gently rinsed twice with PBS, and then incubated with
calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) for 15 min to strain
live (green) and dead (red), respectively, for 15 min at 37 °C
and 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Samples were viewed using
a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X700, KEYENCE).
