The
molecular orientation effect of a liquid crystalline (LC) epoxy
resin (LCER) on thermal conductivity was investigated, with the thermal
conductivity depending on the surface free energy of amorphous soda–lime–silica
glass substrate surfaces modified using physical surface treatments.
The LC epoxy monomer was revealed to form a smectic A (SmA) phase
with homeotropic alignments on the surfaces of substrates that possess
high surface free energies of 71.3 and 72.7 mN m–1, but forming a planar alignment on the surface of a substrate that
possesses a relatively low surface free energy of 46.3 mN m–1. The optical microscopy observations and the X-ray analyses revealed
that the LC epoxy monomer also induced a homeotropically aligned SmA
structure due to cross-linking with a curing agent on the high-free-energy
surface. The orientational order parameter of the resulting homeotropic
SmA structure was calculated from the grazing incidence small-angle
X-ray scattering patterns to be 0.73–0.75. The thermal conductivity
of the cross-linked LCER forming a homeotropically aligned SmA structure
was also estimated to be 2.0 and 5.8 W m–1 K–1 for the average and maximum in the direction of the
Sm layer normal. The value of the thermal conductivity was remarkable
among the thermosetting polymers and ceramic glass, and the LCER could
be applied for high-thermal-conductive adhesives and packaging materials
in electrical and electronic devices.

1 Introduction
Because electric and electronic devices are rapidly being downsized
and their power energy being enhanced, the heat density generated
in such devices is continuously increasing. Although the metallic
parts of heat spreaders and heat sinks have widely been used in the
devices, they have not yet been enough to address the heat generated
in advanced devices. Therefore, polymer components in the devices-mold
resin, adhesives, coating materials, and so forth also need to possess
high thermal conductivity.

The thermal conductivity of typical
amorphous polymers (approximately
0.1–0.5 W m–1 K–1) was
around 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that of metal and
ceramic materials.1 Generally, high-thermal-conductive
ceramic particles, such as alumina (Al2O3),2,3 boron nitride,4−7 and aluminum nitride,8−10 have added into polymers to increase the thermal
conductivity. However, these additives probably lead to a lack of
some properties, such as adhesiveness and lightness, in filling a
high amount of ceramic particles. Therefore, increasing the thermal
conductivity of the polymers themselves is essential. Kang et al.11 reported a high-thermal-conductive liquid crystalline
(LC) polymer, which was photopolymerized using a thiol–ene
reaction between disk-shape (discotic) liquid crystal (DLC) molecules.
The thermal conductivity of the photopolymerized DLC polymer with
a uniaxial orientation was estimated to be 3.0 W m–1 K–1 in the transverse direction of the oriented
columnar axis. Geibel et al.12 also reported
a 5.2 W m–1 K–1 uniaxitially oriented
nematic (N) LC acrylate polymer, which was photopolymerized from the
LC diacrylate monomer due to UV irradiation on the rubbed polyimide
film.

Among polymers, epoxy resin (ER) has been applied to diverse
applications
because of its abundance of properties, such as high thermal resistance,
electrical insulation, moldability, and adhesiveness. These properties
suit the requirements of components in electric/electronic devices.
Therefore, high-thermal-conductive ERs are desirable for heat dissipation
in such applications. Up to date, various LCERs have been synthesized13−22 and intensively investigated because of their abundance of outstanding
properties, such as high thermal conductivity,23−28 fractural toughness,29−32 and moisture resistance,33 in addition
to the properties of general LCs or amorphous ERs. These remarkable
properties are considered to depend on the macroscopically formed
polydomain structures and the microscopically formed anisotropic LC
structures in the domains. The LC epoxy monomers can spontaneously
form LC ordering derived from the mesogenic core in the molecules.
The LC ordering is maintained or developed during their cross-linking
with a curing agent, which can suppress phonon scattering to improve
the thermal conductivity.23 Although the
thermal conductivity of LCERs varied corresponding to their chemical
structures, LC orders, and so forth, those values (0.29–0.96
W m–1 K–123,24,28) were much higher than those of conventional
amorphous ERs (0.17–0.21 W m–1 K–1). Later, Song et al. reported25 that
the thermal conductivity of an LCER could increase to 1.16 W m–1 K–1 by forming spherical domains
with diameter more than 80 μm. One reason for this increase
in the thermal conductivity was considered to be a reduction in the
domain boundaries. The other reason should be an increase in the volume
fraction of the LCER molecules aligned parallel to the direction of
heat conduction, which is supported by the fact that the thermal conductivity
of the aligned LCER is relatively higher in the direction parallel
to the molecular chains than in the transverse direction.24

In the case of adhering two surfaces of
substrates with LCER as
an adhesive, the thermal conductivity of the adhesion layer should
vary depending on the direction of the molecular alignment at the
interface between the surfaces of the substrates and the adhesive
layer of the LCER. The LCER adhesive layer was expected to improve
the thermal conductivity in the direction of the layer thickness by
forming a homeotropic alignment with the two surfaces of the substrates.
Although electric,34 magnetic,24,35,36 and mechanical fields were effective
to form a homeotropic alignment, we aimed to obtain one without those
fields using the surface effects of the substrates to exert a high
thermal conductivity more easily and commonly.

On typical LC
molecules, the physicochemical interactions, such
as hydrogen bonds and dipole–dipole interactions between the
LC molecules and the surfaces of substrates, have been considered
to determine the orientation of the molecules planar or homeotropic
to the surfaces of the substrates. According to the Creagh’s
conception,37 a homeotropic alignment is
induced on the surface of a substrate that possesses a lower surface
free energy than that of an LC (surface free energy of substrate (γS) < surface free energy of liquid (γL))
and a planar alignment is induced on a higher energy surface (γS > γL). However, these were the results
of
utilizing the typical alkyl-terminated LC molecules, and exceptions
also occurred.38 In the case of the diepoxides,
the relationship between the molecular orientation of the LCER and
the surface free energy of solid surfaces has not been fully elucidated.

In this study, we first investigated the relationship between the
molecular orientation of the LCER and the surface free energy of the
glass surface varied by utilizing physical surface treatments. Next,
an LC epoxy monomer was cured with a curing agent on the surface of
the substrate modified by the surface treatment and oriented by the
surface effect without the electric and magnetic fields. Then, the
effect of the resultant alignment of the LCER on the thermal conductivity
was also investigated. As a result, the thermal conductivity of the
cross-linked LCER forming homeotropically aligned SmA structure on
the high-free-energy surface was estimated to be 5.8 W m–1 K–1 for the maximum in the direction of the Sm
layer normal.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 General
Amorphous soda–lime–silica
glass substrates (Matsunami Micro Slide Glasses) were used for polarized
optical microscope (POM) observations and contact angle, grazing incidence
small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) measurements. Thermal treatments were carried out with a Mettler
FP90 central processor with a FP82 HT hot stage. UV/ozone treatments
were conducted with a SEN Lights photo surface processor PL21-200
equipped with a low-pressure mercury lamp EUV200GS-14. The radiant
exposure was measured using an Ushio UIT-150 UV radiometer equipped
with a UVD-S254 photodetector. Water was deionized for use. Diiodomethane
and hexadecane (Wako Pure Chemicals, 136-07812 and 084-03683) were
used as received. Their contact angles were measured by utilizing
a Kyowa Interface Science CA-D goniometer, applying a sessile drop
method.

A tri-mesogenic LC epoxy monomer (Sumitomo Chemical,
hereinafter called TM25,28) and 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (Sun
Chemical, hereinafter called DAN) were used as received. Their molecular
structures, in which the potential energies were minimized, were determined
by molecular mechanical MM2 method with a ChemBio3D Ultra 13.0 (PerkinElmer).
The measurements of the phase transition temperatures and determinations
of LC phases were carried out with a Nikon Optiphot-2 Pol. The POM
was equipped with a Mettler FP82 HT hot stage. Conoscopic observations
were also carried out with the POM. Sekisui Chemical Micro Pearl SP-210
spherical spacers with an average diameter of 10.0 ± 0.5 μm
were used to fabricate 10 μm gap glass cells. The thermal characterization
was performed with a TA Instruments Q-2000 differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC). The GISAXS measurements were carried out by a Rigaku Nano-viewer
system using a Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA) equipped with
a 5-axis stage. A PILATUS-100K detector was used for the measurements.
The WAXD measurements were also performed using a Rigaku RINT2500HL
X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (50 kV, 250 mA).
The Suzuki Optical White Glasses (the average thickness was 30 μm)
and Matsunami Micro Cover Glasses (the average thickness was 145 μm)
were used for the effective thermal conductivity measurements. A TM/DAN
mixture with a 8–33 μm thickness was cured between a
pair of glass substrates. The area of each layer in the three-layer
structures was 10 mm square. The thicknesses of the glass substrates
and each layer of the three-layer structures were measured by a micrometer
and confirmed by measuring on the optical micrographs of the cross
sections of the three-layer structures. The thermal diffusivity, density,
and specific heat capacity were measured using a NETZSCH Instruments
LFA-447 Nanoflash system, a Mirage Trading SD-200L densitometer, and
a TA Instruments Q-2000 DSC, respectively.

2.2 Surface
Treatments and Estimation of Surface
Free Energy of Glass Substrates
Amorphous soda–lime–silica
glass substrates that possess three kinds of different surface states
were prepared. One was untreated (hereinafter called G1), another was thermally treated at 250 °C for 10 min in an
atmosphere (hereinafter called G2), and the other was
UV/ozone treated for 10 min (4.1 J cm–2) after the
thermal treatment (hereinafter called G3). The contact
angles of water, diiodomethane, and hexadecane on the prepared G1–G3 substrates were obtained at ambient
temperature with a goniometer applying a sessile drop method. The
equilibrium relationship between the vectors of the three-phase interfaces
regarding a liquid droplet on a flat solid surface can be described
by Young’s equation 1  Owens–Wendt39 further expanded
the equation using the terms of the dispersive
and polar components of the surface free energy with the geometric
mean method   2  This equation was transformed to
slope-intercept
formula to incorporate results of the contact angles for more than
two liquids at once40 3  The
surface free energy components of the
liquids as described in Table 1(41) and the resulting contact angles
were assigned to eq 3. The surface free energy components of the surfaces of the prepared G1–G3 substrates were calculated from
the linear regression coefficients.

2.3 Chemical Structure and
LC Behavior of LC Epoxy
Monomer
The chemical structures and molecular structures
in which potential energies were minimized for TM and DAN, which we
used as the LC epoxy monomer and curing agent, are shown in Figure 1. TM exhibits a phase
sequence on heating Cr (97 °C) SmA (140 °C) Iso and on cooling
Iso (139 °C) N (138 °C) SmA (50 °C) Cr.28 Textures of TM between pairs of G1–G3 substrates with 10 μm gaps were observed
with a POM under crossed polarizers at 130 °C.

epoxy monomer TM and (b) a curing agent DAN.

2.4 Preparation of LC Epoxy Monomer/Diamine Mixtures
A TM/DAN mixture in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio shows a phase sequence
on heating Cr (92 °C) SmA (112 °C) Iso.28 The curing behavior of the TM/DAN mixture was investigated
using a DSC at the isothermal temperatures of 130, 140, 150, 160,
170, and 180 °C. The textures of the TM/DAN mixtures were also
observed between pairs of G1–G3 substrates
under crossed polarizers during curing at 150 °C. Then, the droplets
of TM/DAN mixtures were cured on the prepared G1–G3 substrates at 150 °C for 2 h. The GISAXS and WAXD
measurements of the cured droplets were carried out at room temperature.

2.5 Effective Thermal Conductivity Measurements
The thermal diffusivity, density, and specific heat capacity of
the cured TM/DAN mixture and glass substrates were measured at a constant
pressure using a Xe flash apparatus, a densitometer, and a DSC apparatus,
respectively. Additionally, pairs of G1–G3 substrates were adhered with a TM/DAN mixture at 150 °C
for 2 h. The effective thermal diffusivity (αeff)
of the three-layer materials composed of pairs of G1–G3 substrates and the cured TM/DAN layer were also measured
at constant pressure, respectively. Next, the thermal conductivity
of the glass substrates (λsubstrates) and the effective
thermal conductivity of the three-layer materials (λeff) were respectively estimated by 4  where ρeff and CP,eff of the three-layer materials were calculated by42 5  and 6  and ϕv and ϕw are the volume and mass fraction
of TM/DAN, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Surface Free Energy of the G1–G3 Substrates
The thermal treatment
of the prepared G2 substrate was intended to reduce the
surface free energy. This was supported by the fact, which Zhuravlev
reported,43 that a H2O monolayer
is completely removed and the total OH groups on the surface of amorphous
silica significantly decrease, although the Si–O–Si
bonds increase at over 190 °C in vacuo. In contrast, the UV/ozone
treatment is a common practice for the increasing silanol groups on
the glass surface;44,45 therefore, the surface of the
prepared G3 substrate was intended to possess a high
surface free energy compared with the G2 substrate.

The contact angles of water droplets as a polar liquid on the surfaces
of the prepared G1 and G3 substrates were
significantly lower than that of the G2 substrate, whereas
those of hexadecane droplets as a nonpolar liquid on the surfaces
of the G1 and G3 substrates were much higher
than that on the G2 substrate, as exhibited in Table 2. This indicated that
the polarities of the surfaces of the G1 and G3 substrates were higher than that of the G2 substrate,
which is also obvious by the comparison of γSp of the substrates in Table 3 estimated from the linear regression coefficients
described in Figure S1 (the Supporting
Information). Our thermal treatment at 250 °C was revealed to
be effective in decreasing the polar groups on glass surfaces, even
though the treatments were executed in an atmosphere. The increase
in the surface free energy by the UV/ozone treatment was also consistent
with what occurred in preceding studies.44,45 The duration time dependent for UV/ozone treatment for the contact
angles and surface free energy with respect to the surfaces of G2 substrates was also measured and is expressed in Figure S2 (the Supporting Information).

3.2 Characteristics
of TM between the G1–G3 Substrates
Orthoscopic observations
under crossed polarizers revealed that TM sandwiched between a pair
of G2 substrates that possess relatively low γS showed a fan-shaped texture of a planar-aligned SmA phase
(Figure 2b), whereas
TM sandwiched between pairs of G1 and G3 substrates that possess high γS showed dark fields
at 130 °C as shown in Figure 2a,c, respectively. The dark fields were revealed to
be derived from a homeotropically aligned SmA phase but were not isotropic
because Maltese crosses appeared in the textures during conoscopic
observations46 (Figure 2a,c insets). These results were inconsistent
with the Creagh’s conception, where denoted homeotropic alignments
are induced on low energy substrates and planar alignments are induced
on high-energy substrates. Park et al. have reported47 that UV-treated 4-cyano-4′-pentylbiphenyl (5CB)
induced a homeotropic alignment on hydroxyl-terminated surface, which
was considered to possess a high γS. This result
was considered to originate from the formation of hydrogen bonds between
the hydroxyl-terminated surface of a substrate and 4-cyano-4′-pentylcarboxylic
acid generated by the photochemical decomposition of 5CB. Coinciding
with this report, the homeotropically alignments of TM were considered
to be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl-terminated
surfaces of G1 or G3 substrates and the
epoxy groups of TM. It was also supported by the fact that epoxy and
hydroxyl groups can form hydrogen bonds, which have been well researched
in the preceding studies regarding graphene oxides utilizing simulations48 and experiments49,50 and regarding
composites composed of silica and epoxidized natural rubbers.51−53

optical micrographs. The scale bar in (c) is common for all images.

3.3 Characteristics
of the TM/DAN Mixtures on
the G1–G3 Substrates
Figure 3a,b shows the isothermal
DSC curves of the TM/DAN mixtures at various temperatures and the
enlarged view of the curve curing at 150 °C. The heat flow increased
from the start of heating, which derived from the reaction of the
active hydrogen atoms of DAN and the epoxides of TM. After approximately
6–8 min of elapsed time, the peak deriving from an Iso–Sm
transition was generated in addition to the heat of the reaction due
to the cross-linking.13 The TM/DAN mixtures
were also observed by using a POM between the pairs of the G1–G3 substrates during curing at 150 °C under
crossed polarizers, as shown in Figure 4. First, the mixtures melted into the Iso phase (Figure 4a,d,g). Second, the
Sm domains formed in the Iso phase after approximately 8 min had elapsed
(Figure 4b,e,h). The
duration time required for the appearance of Sm structures was almost
consistent with the DSC peak deriving from an Iso–Sm transition
at 150 °C. Next, the molecules forming the Sm structures reoriented
homeotropically or planarly depending on the surface free energy of
the surfaces of the substrates. The resulting alignments of the TM/DAN
mixtures cured between pairs of the G1–G3 substrates (Figure 4c,f,i) corresponded to those of TM between pairs of the G1–G3 substrates (Figure 2a,b,c), respectively. The Maltese crosses
found in the textures by conoscopic observations could be identified
as homeotropic alignments, as shown in Figure 4c,i insets. The mechanism to form a homeotropic
alignment of TM/DAN was considered to be different from TM because
TM/DAN can be influenced by a chemical reaction when it formed a homeotropic
alignment. However, the surface free energy was dominant to determine
the alignments of the LC epoxy thermosets in this case, even though
it was under curing.

140, 150,

at 150 °C.

Figure 4 Orthoscopic optical micrographs
showing textures during isothermal
curing of a TM/DAN mixture at 150 °C between pairs of (a–c) G1, (d–f) G2, and (g–i) G3 substrates taken under crossed polarizers. Textures were observed
at (a), (d), (g) 0, (b), (e), (h) 8, (c), (f), and (i) 12 min from
the start of cure at 150 °C. Insets in (c) and (i) show conoscopic
optical micrographs. The scale bar in (i) is common for all images.

The surface effects on the molecular
orientations of TM/DAN droplets
cured on the G1–G3 substrates were
also investigated by utilizing the GISAXS measurements. The evident
spots in the GISAXS patterns of TM/DAN droplets cured on the G1 and G3 substrates, which corresponded to Sm
layers with a periodicity of approximately 23 Å in the vertical
direction to the G1 and G3 substrates, were
observed (Figure 5a,c).
However, a relatively weak half-ring appeared in the GISAXS pattern
of a TM/DAN droplet cured on the G2 substrate (Figure 5b). The half-ring
was more slightly in the vertical direction to the G2 substrate rather than in the transverse direction. This was also
obvious in a comparison of the GISAXS intensity of qz, qx, and azimuthal (β) scans, as shown in Figure 6. The narrow peaks in the qz scans were only detected
from TM/DAN droplets cured on the G1 and G3 substrates (Figure 6a), although a narrow peak in the qx scans was detected from that on the G2 substrates (Figure 6b). These results also indicate that the TM/DAN is more likely to
form the homeotropically aligned SmA domains on the high γS surfaces but not on the relatively low γS surfaces. The POM images of the TM/DAN droplets cured on the G1–G3 substrates are also shown in Figure 7. These textures
were similar to those of the TM/DAN mixtures cured between the pairs
of the G1–G3 substrates (Figure 4c,f,i). However,
the focal-conic and oily-streak defects were partially observed in
the homeotropically aligned TM/DAN droplets cured on the G1 and G3. The appearance of these defects was considered
to be due to the anchoring at the droplet and the air interface.

patterns for the TM/DAN droplets cured on (a) G1, (b) G2, and (c) G3 substrates.

GISAXS intensities for the TM/DAN droplets cured on the G1, G2, and G3 substrates, respectively.

defects partially observed in the homeotropically aligned TM/DAN droplets
cured on (a) G1 and (c) G3.

Then, the orientational order parameter (S) of
the induced homeotropically aligned Sm layers in the TM/DAN droplets
cured on the G1 and G3 were calculated from
the β scans of GISAXS patterns (Figure 6c) using the following equations, referring
to the calculations by Benicewicz et al.35 and Li et al.36 7  where I and α
express
the SAXS intensity and the angle between the Sm layer plane and the
substrate surface, respectively. The α can be calculated from
cos α = cos χ cos θ, where
θ is the Bragg angle for the scattering and χ is β
+ 90°. Then, I(α) was obtained by fitting
with Lorentzian function (Figure S3, Supporting
Information); the graphs used in the calculations are expressed in Figure S4 (Supporting Information) for further
information. As a result, the orientation parameters were estimated
to be 0.73 and 0.75 for the homeotropically aligned TM/DAN droplets
cured on the G1 and G3 substrate, respectively.
These values were remarkable and superior to 0.4 for an LCER oriented
by curing under a 9.4 T magnetic field, which was reported by Li et
al.,36 and they were close to the value
of 0.8 for an LCER cured under a 12 T magnetic field by Benicewicz
et al.35 The orientational order parameter
of TM/DAN was expected to increase more when TM/DAN was sandwiched
between a pair of G1 or G2 substrates but
not a droplet on the substrate because of no interfaces between the
TM/DAN droplet and air that may generate a disorder.

The WAXD
measurements were also carried out for further information,
as shown in Figure S5 (the Supporting Information);
the first-, second-, third-, and fourth-order diffraction peaks corresponding
to the Sm layers with a periodicity of approximately 23 Å in
the vertical direction to the G1 and G3 substrates
were obviously detected from the droplets cured on their substrates,
whereas the first- and slight second-order diffraction peaks were
only detected from the droplet cured on the G2 substrate.
Broad peaks, which expressed the average distance of 4.7 Å between
rodlike mesogens in the plane of Sm layers, were also detected from
the TM/DAN droplets cured on the G1–G3 substrates.

3.4 Thermal Conductivity of
the TM/DAN Mixtures
Cured between the G1–G3 Substrates
Aiming to investigate the effect of the orientation of the Sm layer
on the thermal conductivity, we estimated the effective thermal conductivities
of the three-layer structures fabricated by curing the TM/DAN mixtures
sandwiched between pairs of the prepared G1–G3 substrates, respectively, as shown in Figure 8. Here, the density and specific
heat capacity of the cured TM/DAN (ρresin and CP,resin) were assumed to be constant regardless
of the molecular direction. The effective thermal conductivities of
the three-layer structures fabricated using pairs of the G1 and G3 substrates, shown as open circles and squares
in Figure 8, respectively,
were all higher than those fabricated using pairs of the G2 substrates, shown as closed squares. All the samples were also confirmed
by utilizing POM observations, where the TM/DAN mixtures of adhesion
layers formed homeotropic alignments between pairs of the G1 and G3 substrates, respectively, whereas they formed
planar alignments between pairs of the G2 substrates,
as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information).
The effective thermal conductivity of the three-layer structure was
also predicted by utilizing the following equation, based on the inverse
rule of mixtures,54 with the thickness
(l) and the thermal conductivity of each layer 8  where the adhesion layers of 0.41, 0.61, 0.81,
and 5.8 W m–1 K–1 were assigned.
The predicted curves are also displayed in Figure 8. The thermal conductivities of the planar
and homeotropically aligned Sm layers of TM/DAN were found to be in
the range of 0.41–0.61 and 0.81–5.8 W m–1 K–1, respectively, and their average values were
0.44 and 2.0 W m–1 K–1 in the
calculations using eq 8. The scatter was considered due to the differences in the order
parameter, cross-linking density, volume of defects, and so on, among
the samples. Thus, the thermal conductivity in the vertical direction
was revealed to be increased approximately 4.5 times for the average
by changing the orientation from a planar to a homeotropic. The maximum
thermal conductivity of the homeotropically aligned Sm layer of the
TM/DAN was estimated to be 5.8 W m–1 K–1, which is higher than the thermal conductivity of 5.2 W m–1 K–1 for the photopolymerized LC diacrylate forming
the N orientation.12 The improvement in
the thermal conductivity in the direction of the layer normal was
attributed to the homeotropically aligned SmA structures to the surfaces
with orientation parameter of 0.73–0.75 induced by the effect
of the high-free-energy surface. Consequently, a glass substrate could
be adhered to another glass substrate with a neglective thermal resistance
using the LC epoxy thermosets without including any filler and also
without a magnetic or electric field. Thus, the combination of the
LCER and the physical surface treatments for increasing the surface
free energy to the substrates was expected to be applied as a high-thermal-conductive
adhesive or as packaging materials for electrical and electronic devices.
This alignment control of the LCER by the surface effect enables control
of the anisotropy of its thermal conductivity. Therefore, the alignment
control also makes the design of the thermal conductive pass in the
devices possible on demand.

average thermal conductivity of the glass substrates. Adhesion layers

4 Conclusions
The relationship between the molecular orientation of an LCER and
the surface free energy of a glass surface varied using physical surface
treatments was investigated. An LC epoxy monomer TM was revealed to
form a homeotropically aligned SmA phase on a substrate surface that
possesses a high surface free energy, but it formed a planar alignment
on a substrate surface that possesses a relatively low surface free
energy. A TM/DAN mixture also formed the homeotropically aligned SmA
structure on a substrate surface that possesses a high surface free
energy under curing. These formations of the homeotropic alignments
were considered because of the attribution of the hydrogen bonds formation
between the hydroxyl-terminated surfaces and the epoxy groups of TM.
The thermal conductivity in the direction of the molecular chains
of a cross-linked LCER that induced a homeotropically aligned SmA
structure was estimated to be 5.8 W m–1 K–1 for the maximum, and it was considered to be derived from the relatively
high orientation parameter of 0.73–0.75. The thermal conductivity
was remarkable among epoxy resins and also amorphous glasses. Therefore,
a combination of the LCER and the surface treatments can be applied
as high-thermal-conductive adhesives or as packaging materials for
electrical and electronic devices. Moreover, this alignment control
of an LCER by the surface effect enables control of the anisotropy
of its thermal conductivity and designing of the thermal conductive
pass in the devices on demand.
