Peptides and proteins have diverse
ultraviolet (UV) photoreaction
pathways that can be activated by the energy of the UV photons absorbed.
Simple light sources such as lamps are conventionally used to study
these photoreactions in solution. This work provides a proof of concept
that femtosecond laser technology can function as a highly potent
UV source in rapidly conducting UV photostability studies of peptides.
Correspondingly, sufficient quantities of photoproducts were generated
in 1 min or less, allowing for identification of known and new photomodifications
in the therapeutic peptides somatostatin-14 and arginine vasopressin.
Identical photoproducts were also generated with a conventional continuous
source. The major modifications included N-formylkynurenine,
a cross-link between Trp and Phe, a Tyr product with an NH3 loss, and disruption of an unstable disulfide bond into a complex
mixture of a trisulfide bond and multiple scrambled dimeric products.
In conclusion, femtosecond lasers are extremely useful to drive fast
UV-induced reactions for high throughput screening of photostability
and modifications in amino acid polymers.

Introduction
Peptides and proteins
have intrinsic chromophores that make them
vulnerable to the exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light in various situations.
In their in vivo environment, these endogenous biomolecules in superficial
tissues such as skin or the eye lens are exposed to UV irradiation
from sunlight.1 Biopharmaceuticals on the
other hand can be exposed to UV light during their manufacture and
administration.2 In applications where
the spectroscopic properties of the amino acid residues are applied,
for example, detection in chromatography, UV wavelengths are used.
During these kinds of exposure, the molecules may suffer from oxidation,
misfolding, and aggregation, which can be detected as abundant artifacts
in analysis or, in the case of light-stressed IgG1, cause immunogenic
response.3−7 Understanding the interaction between UV light and amino acid polymers
can therefore help unravel the photoprocesses that occur to important
proteins in vivo and increased understanding of the photochemical
reactions can aid the design of more stable biopharmaceuticals. Predicting
photostability and photoreactions in peptides and proteins remains
challenging and requires more empirical studies in which powerful
UV sources, such as femtosecond lasers, could be an advantage to use.

The amino acids with the strongest UV chromophoric side chains
are Trp and Tyr. The aromatic side chains have local absorption maxima
close to 280 nm resulting in this wavelength being used to illuminate
peptides and proteins for detection and spectroscopic analysis. At
280 nm, the predicted molar extinction coefficient of Trp (5500 M–1 cm–1) is almost 4-fold higher than
Tyr (1490 M–1 cm–1).8 Upon photoexcitation, new reaction pathways are
unlocked that can lead to covalent modifications. The excitation of
Trp or Tyr can be passed on to molecular oxygen in the solution to
generate reactive singlet oxygen, which can modify the aromatic side
chain.1,3 Among the most common photo-oxidation products
derived from Trp is N-formylkynurenine (NFK). Photoexcitation
can also induce photoionization of the Tyr or Trp side chain, where
the excited electron leaves behind the aromatic group as a radical
cation intermediate that can further react with nearby residues.9,10 The last chromophore that can absorb 280 nm UV light is the disulfide
group (125 M–1 cm–1).8 The direct absorption of a UV photon can induce
homolytic cleavage of the disulfide bond to form two intermediate
thiyl radicals (−S•).11 The photoionization of Tyr or Trp has also been suggested
to cleave the disulfide bond in a one-electron reduction from the
ejected electron.12−14 These intermediates can react into thioether cross-links,
free thiols, scrambled disulfides, and aromatic side chain cross-links
such as di-Tyr.12,15−22

Multiple in-solution photochemistry studies of peptides and
proteins
used continuous wave xenon lamps as the UV light source.12,13,16,17,19,22−27 Xenon has a strong UV output and is approved by the International
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) document Q1B as a UV light source
for photostability studies.28 Discontinuous
light sources, such as femtosecond lasers, have been used to a lesser
extent for in-solution photoreactions of peptides and proteins. Femtosecond
lasers produce short but extremely powerful pulses and therefore possess
the capacity to UV-irradiate many fold more powerful than the currently
used lamps. Femtosecond laser technology has been used in biomolecular
applications to generate stable UV-induced cross-links for immobilizing
proteins onto biosensor surfaces or to trap and study interactions
between peptides, proteins, and DNA–protein complexes.29−33

The aim of this work was to explore if femtosecond laser technology
could be used as an efficient UV light source in photostability studies
of peptides and for generating high yields of the photodegraded products
for characterization of photomodifications. Femtosecond laser pulsing
was compared with continuous irradiation from a xenon lamp coupled
to a diffraction grating in the 280 nm photodegradation of the model
tripeptide Gly–Trp–Gly (GWG). Photostability studies
of the therapeutic hormone peptides somatostatin-14 (1 Trp, 1 disulfide
bond) and arginine vasopressin (1 Tyr, 1 disulfide bond) were efficiently
conducted using the femtosecond laser as the UV source at 280 nm.
The rapidly generated major photoproducts were characterized by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), tandem MS
(LC–MS/MS), and absorption spectroscopy. With shorter irradiation
times using the femtosecond laser, known modifications such as NFK
and thioether cross-linking were generated that were consistent with
previous work using conventional sources. A known modification was
revealed to exhibit new characteristics as dimeric photoproducts with
complex sulfur patterns containing a combination of thioether cross-linking
and disulfide scrambling. Additionally, new modifications were identified
such as a Phe–Trp cross-link, a Tyr-related product involving
loss of NH3, and a trisulfide bond.

Results and Discussion
Femtosecond
Laser-Enhanced Photodegradation of a Trp-Containing
Model Peptide
The performance of a femtosecond laser was
compared to a xenon lamp-diffraction grating setup in a spectrofluorometer
to evaluate the capabilities of the laser in accelerating photoreactions.
The setups allowed comparable irradiation conditions. At 280 nm [±13
nm full width at half-maximum (fwhm)], the xenon lamp had a maximum
power output of ∼1.1 mW that was used for the irradiation experiments.
With the laser setup at the same wavelength maximum (±7 nm fwhm),
an average output of ∼40 mW was used, which is a 36-fold increase
in power compared to the xenon lamp.

Using the tripeptide GWG
for the 280 nm photodegradation ensured that the only side chain damaged
by the exposure to UV light was the indole group of Trp, which was
tracked by measuring Trp fluorescence at 280 nm excitation. The photodegradation
of GWG was accelerated with laser irradiation compared to lamp irradiation
(Figure 1). The computed
half-life (from a single exponential decay) was 1356 s using the lamp,
while laser decreased it to 34 s. This was a 40-fold decrease in half-life
that quantitatively matched the increase in power provided by the
femtosecond laser.

Figure 1 Photodegradation of GWG at 280 nm maximum. Y-axis
is the intensity of Trp emission at 350 nm. The inset is the same
plot but with irradiation time up to 90 s. Emission was measured each
second during xenon lamp irradiation. Emission of the laser-irradiated
samples was measured offline. Data were fitted to one phase decay.
Half-life using the xenon lamp was 1356 s (22 min 36 s) and laser
was 34 s.

The photoionization of Trp leading
to a solvated electron can be
induced by both mono- and biphotonic processes.34,35 In monophotonic reactions leading to photoproducts, linear correlations
should be observed between irradiation power and photoconversion of
precursor into product. Also, pulsing sources should induce the same
photoconversion as a continuous source at the same average power.
In the photodegradation of the model peptide GWG, the correlation
between the increase in power and the decrease in half-life using
the pulsing laser corresponded to a one-photon reaction.

Rapid Laser-Induced
Photodegradation of Somatostatin-14 Versus
Arginine Vasopressin
Somatostatin-14 (sequence: AGCKNFFWKTFTSC) is a fourteen residue peptide with one Trp residue and one disulfide
bond. All degradation of the peptide was localized to the Trp residue
by comparing quantification of Trp fluorescence and ultrahigh performance
liquid chromatography (UHPLC) quantification of the intact molecule
(Figure 2A).

Figure 2 Laser-induced
degradation (280 nm maximum at 40 mW) of somatostatin-14
(1 Trp, 1 disulfide) and vasopressin (1 Tyr, 1 disulfide). Quantity
(y-axis) of the peptide precursor was determined
by the area at 215 nm absorbance in UHPLC and by the intensity of
Trp (350 nm) or Tyr (310 nm) emission. (A) Somatostatin-14 data was
fitted to one-phase decay. (B) Vasopressin Tyr emission was fitted
to one-phase decay and 215 nm UHPLC area was fitted to two-phase decay.

Arginine vasopressin (sequence: CYFQNCPRG) is a nonapeptide with one Tyr residue
and one disulfide
bond. Interestingly, the photoinstability profile of vasopressin was
different compared to somatostatin-14. It required 4 min of laser
irradiation of somatostatin-14 to degrade 33% precursor, while for
vasopressin, it only took 30 s to degrade 34%, corresponding to an
8-fold higher photostability of somatostatin-14 versus vasopressin.
This photodegradation dissimilarity is in contrast to the almost 4-fold
higher 280 nm extinction coefficient of Trp versus Tyr. At 34% degradation
of intact vasopressin, Tyr fluorescence degraded 3% (Figure 2B). The gap in quantification
reflected that most of the photoinstability of vasopressin was not
due to the Tyr residue, even though it was the strongest UV chromophore
in the molecule. Interestingly, vasopressin displayed a biexponential
decay with fast degradation in the first 30 s, while somatostatin-14
displayed single exponential decay. This initial faster degradation
supported a concentration-dependent photoreaction that dominated the
photoinstability of vasopressin.

Photoreaction and Products
of Somatostatin-14
LC–MS
characterization of the photoproducts of somatostatin-14 supported
that all modifications were located within the Trp residue. All identified
photoproducts that were generated by femtosecond laser pulsing were
also generated using the lower-powered continuous xenon lamp (data
not shown) and were therefore not specific to the laser irradiation.

Photoreaction of Trp to NFK in somatostatin-14 was achieved. The
NFK photoproduct was identified by a mass gain of two oxygen atoms
and a characteristic ∼323 nm absorption maximum (Figures 3 and S1). Also, with tandem MS fragmentation, the mass gain of two oxygen
atoms was localized to the Trp residue (Figure S2). The photoproduct quantity after 1 minute was sufficient
for LC–UV–MS analysis, illustrating that the laser was
efficient in the production of NFK-somatostatin-14 and the remaining
major photoproducts. Trp to NFK photoconversion in somatostatin-14
has previously been reported after exposing the peptide to fluorescent
light for 10 days.36 Despite NFK being
a very common photo-oxidation product, it was not the dominant photomodification.

(1 Trp, 1 disulfide) using the femtosecond laser (40 mW). “M”
represents the mass of the precursor. Asterisk (*) represents spectroscopic
modification of the Trp residue analyzed by online UPLC absorbance
spectroscopy (Figure S1).

Two other major photoproducts with isobaric somatostatin-14
masses
were identified (retention time ∼10.5 min, Figure 3). Interestingly, the absorption
spectra showed that the classical Trp absorption profile with a 280
nm local maximum was absent. For the isobaric photoproduct of the
largest quantity, the absorption spectrum revealed two new local maxima
of ∼251 and ∼284 nm (Figure S1). The loss of Trp fluorescence (Figure 2A) and alteration to two new absorption maxima
could be the result of new chromophores created by photoinduced cross-linking
between Trp and another aromatic residue. The tandem MS fragmentation
data were consistent with the spectroscopy data. In reduced somatostatin-14,
sequence coverage with b and y ions
next to Trp8 was obtained, but for the reduced isobaric photoproduct,
the coverage of Trp8 was worsened (Figure 4). Especially the b7 and y7 ions, which are formed
from a fragmentation of the peptide bond between Phe7 and Trp8, were
diminished. Usually such a decrease or disappearance of sequence coverage
in MS/MS analysis derives from sequences within cyclic structures.
In collision-induced fragmentation, a cyclic structure formed by a
cross-link between Phe7 and Trp8 could give a fragment from the back-bone
cleavage of the closest covalent bond to the cyclic structure, which
is the N–Cα bond in Phe7. Such a fragment of somatostatin-14
is the c6 ion (b6 + NH3) which was strongly increased in the reduced
isobaric photoproduct (Figure 4). Combining the data, it was likely that the ∼251
nm chromophore was the modified Phe7, and the ∼284 nm chromophore
was the modified Trp8. Cross-linking between the two aromatic side
chains permits the formation of multiple isomers and explains why
two photoproducts were detected.

and summary of the identified fragments.

The photoproducts containing the Phe7–Trp8 cross-link were
challenging to identify because of the identical mass to the native
peptide. The total mass of the two side chains could be preserved
through an atomic rearrangement induced by photonic excitation of
Trp8 followed by photoionization. Thus, the indole group of Trp8 transfers
an electron and proton to the phenyl group of Phe7 to reduce a double
bond. The neutral radicals of indolyl and phenyl form the observed
cross-link.

The spatial proximity between Phe and Trp in somatostatin-14
enables
cross-linking upon UV light exposure and may also occur in other peptides
or proteins with similar positions of these residues. By using the
efficient UV laser source for a limited irradiation time, LC–UV–MS
analysis was capable of identifying the Phe–Trp photo-cross-link,
which is reported for the first time here.

Overview of the Photoreaction
and Products of Arginine Vasopressin
Analyzing the photoreaction
of vasopressin with LC–MS revealed
why the photodegradation of Tyr did not match the total laser-induced
degradation of the peptide (Figure 2B). A complex mixture of diverse photoproducts was
observed where the original disulfide group was modified by the UV
irradiation (Figure 5). The sulfur photoproducts could be categorized into either monomeric
or dimeric species. The monomeric species were all modified in the
number of sulfur atoms in the original disulfide bridge. The identifications
were a monosulfide (M – S, RSR), a trisulfide (M + S, RSSSR),
a trisulfide trioxide (RS(SO3)SR), and a photoproduct with
a mass loss corresponding to an NHS moiety (M – NHS). The identified
dimeric species had the mass of two oxidized vasopressin molecules
(2M), the mass of two oxidized molecules with loss of two hydrogen
atoms (2M – 2H) or the mass of two molecules with loss of an
NH3S moiety (2M – NH3S). The identified
photoproducts were also generated using the lower-powered continuous
xenon lamp (data not shown) and were therefore not specific to the
femtosecond laser pulsing.

of vasopressin
(1 Tyr, 1 disulfide) using femtosecond laser (40 mW). “M”
represents the mass of the precursor. Asterisk (*) represents spectroscopic
modification of the Tyr residue analyzed by online UPLC absorbance
spectroscopy (Figure S3).

The Tyr residues of the sulfur photoproducts were intact
in the
ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) absorption analysis.
In one major photoproduct, M – NH3 (retention time
49.5 min, Figure 5),
a modulated Tyr absorption profile with a new maximum of ∼294
nm was identified (Figure S3). The mass
loss, modification of the aromatic side chain, and the proximity of
Tyr to the N-terminus, all together resembled a previous UV photostudy
of GWG, where the same mass loss was observed.37

LC–MS analysis of the 30 s sample (Figure 5) revealed two 2M
photoproducts that dominated
the photodegradation reflecting a concentration-dependent photoreaction
(Figure 2B). At the
same time, the remaining photoproducts, such as the trisulfide, 2M
– 2H species, and M – NH3, had a linear correlation
between irradiation time and quantity.

UV Light-Induced Trisulfide
Modification
Monosulfide
(thioether) and trisulfide vasopressin were the initial photoproducts
in the chromatogram (Figure 5). Generation of a monosulfide from a disulfide bond upon
UV irradiation has previously been reported for the vasopressin homologue
oxytocin.15 However, there is no detailed
information that UV light can introduce trisulfides. High-resolution
MS allowed us to distinguish mass shifts corresponding to two oxygen
atoms (31.98 Da) or to one sulfur atom (31.97 Da). The sulfur contents
in mono-, di-, and trisulfide vasopressin were also confirmed by collision-induced
fragmentation. In the fragmentation of a disulfide group, the sulfur
bridge can be cleaved at either the C–S or S–S bonds
to yield a sulfur triplet pattern.38 In
the vasopressin disulfide group, distributed cleavage of the three
bonds in the (Cys1)CH2–S–S–CH2(Cys6) bridge gave a sulfur triplet pattern of the y4 ion corresponding to zero, one, or two sulfur
atoms in the y4 ion (Figure 6). The identification of a y4 + S (y4 + 31.97 Da) ion confirmed that two sulfur atoms were present
in the disulfide bridge. In the monosulfide group, the (Cys1)CH2–S–CH2(Cys6) bridge was supported
by the complete disappearance of the y4 + S ion. In the trisulfide group, the (Cys1)CH2–S–S–S–CH2(Cys6) bridge
was supported by identification of y4 + S and y4 + S2 ions.

variants in its y4 fragment.

The laser results efficiently demonstrated that a trisulfide
bridge
can be formed in a disulfide bond-containing peptide due to UV light
exposure. This could have implications, for example, in the field
of recombinant monoclonal antibodies where UV light exposure occurs
in manufacturing (e.g., during UV detection in chromatography) and
because antibodies have been reported to harbor trisulfides.39,40

UV Light-Induced Disulfide Bond Scrambling
The dimeric
species carried scrambled intermolecular disulfide bonds because the
species were depleted under reducing conditions (Figure 7A). In the MS/MS analysis of
the dimeric products, fragmentation at the intermolecular disulfide
bonds was observed which resulted in monomeric fragments of varying
sulfur contents, revealing the number of intermolecular disulfide
bonds (Figure S4). The intact mass of 2M
observed for two photoproducts supported that all cysteine residues
participated in two intermolecular disulfide bonds in different patterns,
while monomeric fragments with two additional sulfur atoms confirmed
the two intermolecular disulfide bonds (Figure S4, first spectrum). With four Cys residues in a homodimer,
the disulfide bond pattern can arrange the monomers in parallel or
antiparallel, which is why two 2M species were observed. The intact
mass of 2M – 2H supported that one intermolecular disulfide
bond was present and that the monomers (M – H) each had one
cross-linking thioether that each contributed to the loss of one hydrogen
atom. The monomeric fragment with only one additional sulfur atom
was present, confirming the one intermolecular disulfide bond (Figure S4, second spectrum). The 2M –
NH3S photoproducts also contained one intermolecular disulfide
bond. Additionally, cleavage of the bond gave rise to a monomeric
M – NHS fragment as well as a fragmentation pattern similar
to 2M – 2H (Figure S4, third spectrum).
It is therefore likely that the total loss of NH3S was
a combination of two modifications that together scrambled to dimeric
species.

the mass of the precursor. Alkylated sulfur atoms are annotated with
asterisk (*). (B) Cys6 dithiohemiacetal structural isomer is designated

Surprisingly, disulfide scrambling was the dominating
photodamage
in vasopressin, found as intermolecular bridges causing the dimeric
structures in the abundant 2M and 2M – 2H species. The formation
of scrambled disulfide bonds by exposure to UV light could be a secondary
reaction following the initial photoconversion of the native disulfide
bond into thiols that subsequently reoxidize into non-native disulfide
bonds. The UV photoreaction of vasopressin illustrated that the photoconversion
of disulfide bonds to free thiols can be the primary photoreaction
in a peptide or protein. Disulfide scrambling induced by UV light
exposure has also been observed in a monoclonal antibody and human
growth hormone.18,19 However, it has not previously
been reported that photoproducts with a thioether can participate
in scrambling due to the initial presence of free thiols from the
other sulfur atom in the original disulfide group.

Irreversible
Photomodification of the Disulfide Bond: the Dithiohemiacetal
Isomers
Further characterization of 2M – 2H unraveled
in more detail the complex sulfur structure. In short, the data supported
that the vasopressin disulfide group (R1CH2–SS–R2) could photoreact into an irreversible dithiohemiacetal (R1CH(−SH)–S–R2), as previously
reported for the vasopressin homologue oxytocin.15 The dithiohemiacetal group in a peptide is a β-carbon
from one of the two cysteine side chains bound to a primary sulfur
(thiol, +H) and secondary sulfur (thioether, −H) as a chiral
center. If the photogenerated thiol in the dithiohemiacetal reoxidizes
to a non-native disulfide bond with another dithiohemiacetal, the
resulting mass is 2M – 2H.

While a reduction of the 2M
species would result in vasopressin with two thiols (M + 2H), a reduction
of the 2M – 2H species resulted in monomers with one thiol
and the mass of M. A large population with the mass of M was therefore
stable under the reducing conditions (retention time 13 min, Figure 7A). Alkylation of
the reduced laser-irradiated sample confirmed that only one thiol
was present in the irreversible monomeric photoproducts (Figure 7B). The alkylation
of the thiol revealed that the chiral β-carbon in dithiohemiacetal
was distributed between the side chains of Cys1 and Cys6 to two structural
isomers. The first dithiohemiacetal species to elute in the chromatography
(retention time 11 min, Figure 7B) was identified to contain the chiral β-carbon in
the Cys6 side chain while the last to elute (retention time 14 min)
contained the chiral β-carbon in Cys1. Characterization of the
sulfur patterns that identified and described the dithiohemiacetal
modification and their isomers was possible because the thioether
between the β-carbons was cleaved to yield a2 and y4 ions that correspondingly
covered the Cys1 and Cys6 residues. Thus, Cys1-dithiohemiacetal vasopressin
fragmented into the alkylated a2 ion and
conventional y4 ion, while Cys6-diothiohemiacetal
oppositely fragmented into the conventional a2 ion and alkylated y4 ion (Figure S5). Because the dithiohemiacetals had
a chiral β-carbon, both R/S-enantiomers could be produced from each of the two structural isomers
to yield a total of four isomers. This was confirmed by the additional
two isomers found in the second peak in the chromatogram (retention
time 11.5 min, Figures 7B or S5), which contained a partial co-elution
of the fragment pairs from Cys1- or Cys6-dithiohemiacetal. Four dithiohemiacetal
isomers oxidizing into intermolecular disulfide bonds also explained
why there were ten 2M – 2H species under nonreducing conditions
(Figure 8A, second
panel). The two Cys sites photomodified to dithiohemiacetal groups
in the dimeric isomers were identified by tracking the conventional a2 and y4 ions (which
only include unmodified Cys residues) in the fragmentation of all
ten isomers (Figure 8A, third and fourth panels). The distribution of the two dithiohemiacetal
groups reoxidized to a scrambled disulfide bond enables three possible
structural isomers of dimeric dithiohemiacetal-vasopressin (Figure 8B). For the dithiohemiacetal-vasopressin
structural heterodimer (Cys1 + Cys6 dithiohemiacetal), all four possible
stereoisomers (2n) from the two chiral
centers (n = 2) were confirmed in the MS/MS characterization
by the simultaneous presence of a2 and y4 ions. For each of the two dithiohemiacetal
structural homodimers (2 × Cys1- or 2 × Cys6 dithiohemiacetal),
all three possible stereoisomers (2n –
1) were observed by the exclusive presence of the a2 or y4 ion. The loss of the
fourth stereoisomer in the homodimers is because the R,S configuration in the homodimers is a meso structure
that because of symmetry constitutes one isomer.

dithiohemiacetal (2M – 2H) species from the laser-irradiated
(280 nm, 40 mW, 5 min) sample of vasopressin. Cys annotated with asterisk
(*) contains a dithiohemiacetal isomer. For the 2M – 2H species,
the extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) m/z range was 722.95–722.97, which covered the most abundant
isotopic peak in the 3+ charged cluster. The XICs of the MS/MS fragmentations
of the 3+ charged clusters covered the monoisotopic peaks of the 1+
charged fragments: a2 (239.08–239.09), y4 (431.21–431.23). The MS/MS fragmentations
were at 30% collision energy. (B) Deduced structural isomers of dimeric
dithiohemiacetal-vasopressin (2M – 2H) photoproducts. Asterisk
(*) here designates the chiral carbon atoms in the dithiohemiacetal
structural isomers.

The characterization
and identification of the dithiohemiacetal
photomodification was not straightforward. One reason was that the
thiol reoxidized into the more complex 2M – 2H species, second
was that the reduced monomeric form of the dithiohemiacetal group
has identical mass to its precursor disulfide group, and the third
was that the thioether linkage between the original Cys1 and Cys6
disrupts MS/MS fragmentation. The formation of the dithiohemiacetal
group upon photoexcitation of a disulfide bond has previously been
identified in a 12 residue model peptide, IgG1 antibody, and human
growth hormone.18,41,42 This diversity in the molecular formats emphasizes that the photoconversion
of the disulfide group to a dithiohemiacetal is not a molecule-specific
photomodification but relies on fundamental reaction mechanisms induced
by UV light. The photoreaction was proposed to be initiated by a direct
photoexcitation of the disulfide group which dissociates to thiyl
radicals (−S•) that cause the atomic rearrangements.
The details of the mechanisms are described elsewhere.15,41 Our LC–MS analysis showed that the dithiohemiacetal is a
dominant photomodification of the disulfide group consistent with
previous results.15,18,41 There is no prior information of UV light-induced dithiohemiacetal
isomers. The isomers may be challenging to separate as was the case
for reduced and alkylated dithiohemiacetal-vasopressin. However, in
one UV photochemistry study, an additional photoproduct was found
with an isobaric mass to the identified dithiohemiacetal product.41 The authors reported that the MS/MS data were
too poor for detailed characterization. It is likely that the uncharacterized
photoproduct was an isomeric variant of dithiohemiacetal. Dithiohemiacetals
can potentially be harmful photomodifications regarding the function
of the peptide or protein. The modification is irreversible due to
the thioether cross-link and the free thiol can introduce nonnative
disulfide bonds as have been seen for the 2M – 2H species of
vasopressin.

Conclusions
Our evaluation of the
femtosecond laser delivered promising results
and demonstrated that the technology can function as a highly advantageous
UV light source in driving fast photoreactions of amino acid polymers.
Using a continuous wave source, it was shown that by moving to femtosecond
laser technology, the photochemistry was accelerated by a factor of
40, roughly proportional to the measured power ratio between the two
UV light sources. With the increased acceleration, photostability
studies can be conducted within few minutes depending on the molecule
and the wanted extent of degradation. Analyzing the same samples,
sufficient quantities were rapidly generated of a diverse set of known
and novel photomodifications without any additional sample treatment
before the chromatographic UV detection and characterization by MS.
Two recent UV photoreaction studies of monoclonal antibodies used,
for the LC–MS analysis, irradiation times between 15 and 60
min at the wavelengths of 254 and 305 nm maximum, or 24 h following
the ICH irradiation procedure.19,43 A recent photodegradation
study of Trp- and disulfide-containing model peptides at 280 nm maximum
reported irradiation times of 2–3 h for about 30% degradation
of Trp fluorescence.27 Here, the 30% laser
degradation of Trp fluorescence of somatostatin-14 was achieved after
roughly 3.5 min, corresponding to a 34 to 51-fold shorter irradiation
time. In a previous photodegradation of somatostatin-14, it was reported
that LC–MS analysis after 20 min irradiation at 305 nm maximum
did not detect any significant difference.36 In comparison, using the femtosecond laser, it is probable that
an irradiation time of 1 min or less would be adequate for stability
screening and analysis of the major photoproducts of peptides and
proteins. The sample volume can be decreased to further optimize the
irradiation times.

Using the femtosecond laser, the presented
data unexpectedly illustrated
that there is not necessarily a clear correlation between chromophoric
strength and photoreactivity into covalent products. Even though somatostatin-14
has a higher predicted extinction coefficient, it was still a more
UV photostable peptide than vasopressin. Also, the remarkable difference
in sulfur photoreactivity between the intramolecular disulfide bonds
in somatostatin-14 and vasopressin interestingly exemplified that
the photoreaction pathways of the same chromophore can be highly molecule-specific.
In somatostatin-14, there was no photoreactivity of its disulfide
bond, while for vasopressin, its disulfide bond was the most unstable
280 nm chromophore in both peptides. This was interesting because
the 280 nm extinction coefficient of the disulfide bond is expected
to be 12-fold lower than Tyr and 44-fold lower than Trp. Overall,
the photostability of an amino acid polymer should not exclusively
be predicted by the chromophores in the sequence.

All of the
identified photoproducts of somatostatin-14 and vasopressin
that were generated by femtosecond laser pulsing were also generated
using the lower-powered continuous xenon lamp. This supported that
the diverse photoreactions in these peptides were monophotonic processes.
Promisingly, without introducing artifact photoproducts, the more
powerful pulse sources could therefore function as viable UV light
sources and replace continuous sources for higher experimental throughput
in photoreaction studies of therapeutic peptides and proteins.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
GWG, somatostatin-14, and arginine
vasopressin (vasopressin) were synthesized in-house. Peptides were
solubilized in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and diluted
to relevant concentrations: GWG (40 μM), somatostatin-14 (500
μM), and vasopressin (500 μM).

Sample Irradiation with
UV Light
Samples were exposed
to continuous wave irradiation or femtosecond pulsing at 280 nm maximum.
Power of the irradiation beams were measured with a power meter (StarLite
Meter, Ophir, Israel). The spectra of the beams were collected with
a spectrometer (AvaSpec-HS-TEC, Avantes, Netherlands) for the determination
of the wavelength spread at fwhm. Samples of 3 mL were irradiated
in a 1 cm path length in fluorescence macrocuvettes (101-QS, Hellma
Analytics, Germany) at 21 °C while magnetically stirred. Aliquots
were stored at −18 °C.

For continuous irradiation,
the excitation setup in a spectrofluorometer (RTC 2000, Photon Technology
International, Canada) was used. In the setup, the UV light source
was a 75 W xenon arc lamp coupled to a diffraction grating for wavelength
selection. When excitation slits were set to 6 mm for the highest
280 nm output (±13 nm fwhm), power was ∼1.1 mW at the
entrance port to the sample chamber. The steady-state fluorescence
mode was used to conduct the continuous irradiation.

For the
femtosecond laser irradiation, a Tsunami XP (Spectra-Physics,
CA, USA) laser was pumped by a Millennia eV laser (Spectra-Physics,
CA, USA) to generate 840 nm pulses of ∼100 femtosecond duration
at a repetition rate of 80 MHz. The 840 nm output was frequency-tripled
to 280 nm by a UHG module (Spectra-Physics, CA, USA). The pulse beam
at 280 nm maximum (±7 nm fwhm) was tuned to a stable average
output of ∼40 mW at the sample holder.

Quantification of Photodegradation
by Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The spectrofluorometer used
for the continuous wave irradiation
was also used for quantifying the degraded intensities of Trp or Tyr
fluorescence. Trp or Tyr emission intensities were collected at 280
nm excitation. During the xenon lamp irradiation of GWG (using the
steady-state fluorescence mode), emission was also collected each
second. For the laser-irradiated samples, emission spectra were collected
with the emission scan mode at 1 nm resolution.

Sample Treatment
after UV Irradiation
Reduced samples
were prepared by incubation with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP) for 30 min at room temperature. Reduced and alkylated samples
were prepared by incubation with 5 mM TCEP and 5 mM iodoacetamide
(IAA) for 30 min at room temperature.

LC–UV–MS
Analysis of the UV-Irradiated Samples
An Orbitrap Fusion
Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
CA, USA) was coupled to a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system with a VF-D40
detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA). A Synapt G2-Si (Waters,
UK) was coupled to an Acquity UPLC Classic system with the Acquity
Photodiode Array (PDA) detector (Waters, UK). Reverse-phase chromatography
was performed with the Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column, 1.0 × 150
mm, 1.7 μm (Waters, UK) using solvent A (0.1% formic acid in
water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) as the mobile
phase. The remaining procedures and settings were standard.

Software
and Data Analysis
Xcalibur Qual Browser 3.0.63
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA), MassLynx 4.1 (Waters, UK), and
GPMAW 9.51 (Lighthouse Data, Denmark) were used to analyze the LC–UV–MS
data. GraphPad Prism 7.04 was used for graphs and fitting. Accelrys
Draw 4.1 SP1 was used to draw molecular structures.
