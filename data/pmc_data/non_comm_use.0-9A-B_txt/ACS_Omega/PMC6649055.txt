Aurophilic interaction plays a very
important role in gold-related
clusters. Here, we investigate the AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) cluster ions using Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometry in combination with theoretical calculations.
Three cluster ions of Au2Cl3–, Au3Cl4–, and Au4Cl5– show their remarkable intensities
in the mass spectrum. Geometric structure optimizations for AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) were performed on the MP2 level.
The results show that the most stable structures of AunCln+1– (n = 2–7) are all characterized by a zigzag
structure. Furthermore, it can be found that the aurophilic interactions
containing terminal gold atoms strengthen with the increase of total
gold atoms and progressively stabilize for large clusters of Au6Cl7– and Au7Cl8–, whereas the aurophilic interactions between
nonterminal adjacent gold atoms stabilize at n =
5.

Introduction
Gold-containing compounds
and clusters play an important role in
the fields of catalysis,1−4 supramolecular chemistry,5 and material science.6,7 The chemical properties of gold
clusters are affected by their structures as well as the interactions
among Au atoms very much. In 1988, Schmidbaur first observed that
the gold(I) molecule showed a short Au···Au distance
in the crystalline state.8,9 Furthermore, the term
“aurophilicity” was formally proposed.10 Aurophilic interaction has an energy between those of van
der Waals force and covalent bonding and plays an important role in
stabilizing Au(I) compounds.11,12 Pyykkö and co-workers
theoretically investigated the aurophilic interactions between closed
shell Au(I) cationic centers over the past years.13−16 They suggested that the nature
of aurophilic interactions can be understood as a dispersion effect.

Among these related species, gold halides are found to be very
useful in gold-catalyzed reactions.1,17−20 Thus, understanding their structures and properties have attracted
a great amount of research in recent years.21−27 For example, Lemke investigated the microsolvated clusters of gold
chloride by experiment and theoretical calculations.22 The results show that microsolvation enhances electron
localization between Au centers. Li et al. systematically investigated
the periodicity and electronic structures of gold tetrahalides [AuX4]− (X = F, Cl, Br, I, At, or Uus).23 Their results show that the Au(I) tends to be
preferred for heavy halides. Wang et al. observed two types of isomers
of Au2I3– with acute and obtuse
Au–I–Au angles and named them bond-bending isomers (BBIs).25

Although the aurophilic interactions have
been widely studied,
investigation of the effect of cluster sizes on aurophilic interactions
for gold-related clusters is rare. Because the sizes of clusters have
a great impact on their structures, properties, and catalytic activities,
this kind of research will be very important and valuable. Here, we
investigate clusters of AunCln+1– (n = 2–7)
through Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT ICR) mass spectrometry
combined with theoretical calculations. The present study focuses
on the relationship between the size of gold-chloride cluster anions
and the aurophilic interaction inside these clusters.

Results and Discussion
A typical laser ablation mass spectrum of AuCl4H is
shown in Figure 1.
Cluster ions of AunCln+1– (n = 1–4), AunCln–1– (n = 2–4), and AunClnH– (n = 2–4) can be clearly identified in the
mass spectrum. Among them, anions of Au2Cl3–, Au3Cl4– and
Au4Cl5– show their remarkable
intensities.

Figure 1 Laser ablation mass spectrum of AuCl4H obtained
in the
negative ion mode.

The structures of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7)
cluster ions were examined through theoretical calculations. Figure 2 shows some structures
and the relative energies (ΔE) of AunCln+1– (n = 1–4) cluster ions on the MP2 level.
As shown in the figure, the lowest energy geometry of AuCl2– has a linear form with a C2v symmetry, in which Au atom is in the middle
of two Cl atoms. For Au2Cl3–, the most stable geometric structure is similar to the obtuse isomer
of Au2I3– found by Wang et
al.,25 and the Au–Au distance reported
here is 3.69 Å. Interestingly, the most stable geometric structures
of Au3Cl4– and Au4Cl5– are very similar. They are all
characterized by a zigzag structure. The zigzag structures are found
to be similar to those previously suggested or reported for some gold-related
species.28−32 For example, previous study showed that the structure of AuCl crystals
prepared by a vapor-transport method consisted of zigzag chains of
Au and Cl with Au–Cl–Au bond angles of 92°.33,34 Other structures that also have some kinds of symmetry are found
to be 10–70 kcal/mol higher in energies than the zigzag structures.
All calculated vibrational frequencies for the most stable structures
of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) are shown in Table S1.

Figure 2 Some structures and their relative energies
(ΔE, in kcal mol–1) of AunCln+1– (n = 1–4) cluster ions on the MP2 level.

Table 1 provides
the main geometric parameters of the most stable structures. It can
be found that the distances between adjacent gold atoms in Au2Cl3– and Au3Cl4– are 3.69, and 3.15 Å, respectively.
For Au4Cl5–, the nonterminal
and terminal Au–Au distances are 3.07 and 3.11 Å, respectively.
Here, the terminal Au–Au distance is defined as the distance
between the terminal gold atom and its adjacent gold atom; and the
nonterminal Au–Au distance is defined as the distance between
two inner adjacent gold atoms. These distances in Au3Cl4– and Au4Cl5– are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of two Au atoms
(3.32 Å), indicating the aurophilic attraction among Au atoms
in the cluster ions. A comparison with these distances in AunCln+1– (n = 2–4) cluster ions shows that with the
increase of Au atoms, the distances between adjacent gold atoms become
shorter. In other words, the aurophilic interactions between adjacent
gold atoms get stronger with the increase in the cluster size of AunCln+1– from n = 2–4.

To better understand
the relationship between the size of gold-chloride
cluster ions and the aurophilic interaction, theoretical calculations
were also performed for anions of Au5Cl6–, Au6Cl7–,
and Au7Cl8– on the same level.
As shown in Figure 3, the most stable structures of Au5Cl6–, Au6Cl7–,
and Au7Cl8– are very similar
in their structures. Remarkably, all of them are characterized by
the zigzag structure. The terminal Au–Au distances in Au5Cl6–, Au6Cl7–, and Au8Cl7– are 3.08, 3.07, and 3.06 Å, respectively, which are slightly
shorter than that in Au4Cl5– (3.11 Å). All nonterminal Au–Au distances in Au5Cl6–, Au6Cl7–, and Au8Cl7– stabilized at 3.06 Å. These results are also listed in Table 1. From this, it can
be found that the more gold atoms in the clusters, the stronger the
aurophilic interactions existed. This trend is prominent for small
clusters (n ≤ 4) but inconspicuous for large
ones (n > 4). For the aurophilic interaction between
two nonterminal adjacent Au atoms, it stabilized more quickly than
that between those including one terminal Au atom; but both of them
stabilized at a distance of 3.06 Å at last.

the MP2 level.

Relativistic effects
in chemistry are based on the electrons that
move at high speed in the atom.13 One of
the most obvious elements of the relativistic effects is gold.35 For exploring the influence of relativistic
effects on the distances of adjacent Au atoms, nonrelativistic ECP60MHF
pseudopotentials26 were applied for Au
atoms, and the results are given in Table S2. For instance, the nonrelativistic Au···Au distance
in Au3Cl4– is 0.91 Å
longer than that obtained based on the relativistic pseudopotentials
ECP60MDF. For other cluster anions, similar results were observed.
All results strongly illustrate that relativistic effects play a very
important role in the aurophilic interactions.

To gain information
on the natural charges and electron configurations
of Au and Cl in these anions, natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses
were performed for AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) on
the same level. The results are listed in Table S3. Compared with the Au atom in AuCl2– (without aurophilic interaction), the Au atoms in AunCln+1– (n ≥ 2) with aurophilic interactions have
higher charges. Besides, the charges of two terminal Au atoms are
basically the same but lower than those of nonterminal Au atoms. For
Au2Cl3–, the electron configuration
of the Au atom is 6s0.635d9.796p0.12, the charges on two Au atoms are both +0.463, and the electron transfer
from Cl to Au is about 0.537e. Meanwhile, the Au
6s orbital population increases, whereas the 5d orbital is depopulated,
which are due to the strong relativistic effects. This trend maintains
with the increase in the number of Au atoms, and the charge on Au
atoms is almost unaffected for these clusters.

Furthermore,
chemical bonding analyses were examined employing
electron localization function (ELF) in Multiwfn program.36Figure 4 provides typical ELF profiles for AunCln+1– (n = 2–7). For Au2Cl3–, there is nearly no electron-pair density between two Au atoms.
As the number of Au atoms increased, the regions between the terminal
gold atom and its adjacent gold atom change from dark to light blue,
indicating the enhanced electron-pair densities, and the regions between
nonterminal adjacent Au atoms do not change much for AunCln+1– (n ≥ 4). The results illustrate progressively
increased aurophilic interactions among these cluster anions and the
difference between terminal and nonterminal Au atoms.

Figure 4 ELFs calculated for AunCln+1– (n = 2–7)
cluster ions.

There are two types of
isomers of Au2I3– observed
with acute (72.0°) and obtuse (100.7°)
Au–I–Au angles.25 Very interestingly,
these isomers are called BBIs, which are quite different from other
type of isomers. Inspired by this work, we wonder if the BBIs existed
in AunCln+1– (n = 2–4) cluster ions.
The geometries were fully searched based on the structures shown in Figures 2 and 3, but no such BBIs were found for AunCln+1– on the
MP2 level. However, we found some geometries with different dihedral
angles in Au3Cl4– and Au4Cl5– clusters. For example, a
planar structure of Au3Cl4– is shown in Figure 5. As shown in the figure, the Aua···Aub distance is 0.11 Å shorter than that in the most stable
structure of 3a-1, and the energy difference between the two structures
is only 2.96 kcal/mol. Similarly, Au4Cl5– also has a planar structure (Figure S1). In the structure, the Aua···Aub distance is 3.02 Å, and the angle between Aua and Aub is 78.28°. The energy difference between
the two structures of Au4Cl5– increases to 3.98 kcal/mol. The softness of the ligand is significant
for the aurophilic attraction.16 Previous
research has shown that the aurophilic attraction gets stronger as
the ligand goes from hard (X = Cl) to soft (X = I).13 Thus, it is suggested here that the aurophilic attraction
would be stronger in gold-iodine clusters, AunIn+1–. Considering
the previously found BBIs of Au2I3–, it is reasonable to suggest that the isomers and geometries of
gold-iodine clusters AunIn+1– should be more interesting
and diverse and need to be further investigated by both experimental
methods and calculations.

Figure 5 Two geometries of Au3Cl4– and their relative energies are given in kcal
mol–1.

To further evaluate the stability of AunCln+1– (n = 2–7) cluster anions, we have calculated their
binding energies.
The binding energies are calculated based on the formula, Aun–1Cln– + AuCl → AunCln+1–. As seen, Figure 6 provides the binding energies of AunCln+1– (n = 2–7) cluster ions. The result shows
that Au2Cl3– and Au3Cl4– have higher binding energies than
others, which is consistent with the abundance of Au2Cl3– and Au3Cl4– observed in the mass spectrum. The difference between the binding
energies of Au5Cl6–, Au6Cl7–, and Au7Cl8– decreases, indicating that the clusters
have convergent structures and properties. Although only AunCln+1– (n ≤ 4) cluster ions were observed in our
mass spectrum, it is believed that the larger cluster anions of Au5Cl6–, Au6Cl7–, and Au7Cl8– with zigzag structures can also be prepared under some appropriate
experimental conditions, considering the strong aurophilic interactions.

Conclusions
In
summary, cluster ions of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7)
were examined by laser ablation mass spectrometry
combined with theoretical calculations. Three major cluster ions of
Au2Cl3–, Au3Cl4–, and Au4Cl5– were observed in the mass spectrum with high abundance.
Theoretical calculations of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) were performed to investigate their geometries on
the MP2 level. The results show that most stable isomers for clusters
of AunCln+1– (n = 2–7) have similar
structures. All of them are characterized by a zigzag structure. Besides,
the average Au(I)···Au(I) aurophilic interaction increases
with the number of Au atoms and progressively stabilizes for large-sized
cluster ions. The size effect on the aurophilic interactions between
nonterminal gold atom pairs is different from the pairs including
one terminal gold atom. For Au7Cl8–, all adjacent Au···Au distances (including terminal
and nonterminal) stabilize at 3.06 Å, much shorter than the sum
of the van der Waals radii of two Au atoms at 3.32 Å. According
to the NBO analyses, strong relativistic effects lead to an increase
in the 6s orbital population and a decrease in the 5d population for
these clusters, and the progressively increased aurophilic interactions
containing terminal gold atoms are also supported by the ELF calculations.

Methods
Experimental
Section
All experiments were performed
on a 7.0T FT ICR mass spectrometer (IonSpec, Varian Inc., Lake Forest,
CA, USA) equipped with a ProMALDI ion source in the negative ion mode.
A 355 nm Nd:YAG laser (Orion, New Wave) was used for the experiments.
Typical laser energy is 3 mJ/pulse. The sample of AuCl4H was purchased from Energy Chemical and prepared in water at a concentration
of 20 mg/mL just before the experiment. The sample of graphene was
purchased from Timesnano Company and dispersed in acetone with a concentration
of 1 mg/mL by sonication for 10 min prior to usage. Then, the two
samples were separately applied onto the stain-less target spot using
a two-layer method. In the method, 1 μL dispersion of graphene
was applied on the sample spot first; after it dried up, 1 μL
solution of AuCl4H was added on the same spot. The target
was then dried in air and placed into the source region of the FT
ICR mass spectrometer.

Computational
Geometry optimizations
of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) were carried
out with the program
Gaussian 09.37 In consideration of the
strong relativistic effects and electron correlations, theoretical
calculations of AunCln+1– (n = 1–7) were
performed on the MP2 level38,39 with the Stuttgart
energy-consistent relativistic pseudopotentials ECP60MDF for Au40 and aug-cc-pVTZ for Cl.41 All optimized structures were confirmed to be local minima structures
by vibrational frequency analysis on the same level. The reported
electronic energies were calculated at 0 K with zero-point energy
corrections. To obtain the atomic charge distributions and electron
configurations of Au and Cl in AunCln+1– (n = 1–7), NBO analyses were also performed with the program
of Gaussian 09. Besides, ELF42 was carried
out to examine the chemical bonding using Multiwfn program.36
