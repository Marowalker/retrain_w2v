Recombinase
polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA
amplification method with broad applications as a point-of-care test
and in molecular biology techniques. Currently, most of the applications
are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the
advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized
RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a
sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library
for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared
DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted.
Thus, to amplify the size-variable DNA library uniformly, we introduced
a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved
the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library,
we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification
of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied
not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but
also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of
different DNA molecules.

Introduction
Recombinase polymerase
amplification (RPA) was first reported in
2006 and has rapidly become an alternative method to polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for various applications.1 Typically, RPA requires a recombinase, single-stranded DNA-binding
protein and a polymerase1 to amplify nucleic
acids. The mechanism of RPA is similar to that of PCR. First, the
recombinase and primer form a complex and attach to the target site.
Then, the polymerase recognizes the primer and extends through the
template DNA. During extension, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins
attach to the opposite strand to stabilize the RPA reaction intermediate.

RPA has two advantages over PCR—reaction temperature and
reaction time. RPA usually proceeds between 37 and 42 °C under
isothermal conditions, which is advantageous for instrument-free field
diagnosis and prevention of heat-induced DNA mutations. The reaction
time for RPA is typically 152 or 20–40
min based on the manufacturer’s protocol, which is shorter
than most PCR reactions. Because of these advantages, RPA is used
for detection and diagnosis of specific bacteria2−4 and viruses.5−8 Moreover, RPA can be conducted on solid-phase materials,9−11 including lateral flow dipstick,10,12−14 which permits the technique to be used in point-of-care tests.

Studies have examined replacing existing PCR-based molecular biology
techniques with RPA-based techniques. For example, allele-specific
RPA is performed for genotyping SNPs using 19-base pair (bp) to 21
bp primers designed in silico.15 Blocked
RPA uses wild-type binding blocked oligo and mutation-specific amplification,16 and miRPA detection is performed by amplifying
two ligated probes using the target miRNA as a splint oligo.17 In addition, digital droplet RPA reduces the
reaction time to 30 min by replacing the amplification method from
PCR to RPA.18 Another example is multiplex
RPA, which detects multiple pathogens simultaneously using multiple
primer pairs.19,20

With the development of
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology,
the importance of error-free and unbiased DNA library amplification
is becoming increasingly important. To achieve a reduced error rate
and unbiased amplification, the researchers proposed several different
methods. For example, researchers compared the fidelity of DNA polymerase21 and used high-fidelity DNA polymerase to reduce
the error which was generated during DNA amplification. Other researchers
used molecular DNA barcode to remove the DNA duplicate22 and amplification bias.23,24 However, most of the methods used PCR as a DNA amplification method,
which has a chance to induce heat-related damages such as deamination
of cytosine to uracil.25

We hypothesized
that replacing PCR with RPA can reduce these heat-related
damages. Thus, in this study, we applied RPA to amplify the DNA library
and designed several experiments to properly implement it. We amplified
sheared DNA and an oligonucleotide DNA library using RPA and identified
the appropriate RPA method for each DNA library. Through this study,
we show that RPA is suitable for NGS sample amplification, further
broadening the potential applications of the RPA method.

Results and Discussion
Random-Sheared
DNA Library Amplification Using RPA
To evaluate amplification
by RPA, we prepared sheared DNA libraries
using genomic DNA from human NA12878 or E. coli EcNR2.26 DNA was sheared into two different
sizes, each averaging between 180 bp and 300 bp (Figure S1), which we termed human small, human large, E. coli small, and E. coli large library, respectively. Sheared DNA libraries were treated
with several enzymes for end repair, dA-tailing, adaptor ligation,
and uracil cleavage, as described in the Materials
and Methods (“NGS sample preparation”). After
uracil cleavage, the sequencing adaptor had flanking sequences longer
than 30 bp. Besides, the RPA reaction has a suggested primer length
of ≥30 bp. Thus, we hypothesized that RPA could be employed
directly for the index attachment step instead of PCR.

To confirm
our hypothesis, we conducted index attachment steps with PCR and two-primer
RPA (n = 3) with the small and large E. coli and human DNA libraries, which were treated
through serial NGS sample preparation steps. Although RPA products
were smaller than PCR products (Figure S2), the samples were successfully sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq
platform (Tables S1, S2). Sequencing data
were analyzed using AdapterRemoval,27 Burrows–Wheeler
alignment (BWA),28 Samtools,29 and in-house python codes. The most abundant
fragment size of RPA-amplified E. coli small and large libraries were 59 bp and 50 bp, respectively, which
were smaller than their corresponding PCR products of 92 bp and 147
bp. The human small and large libraries showed similar trends as the E. coli libraries (Figure S3). Moreover, the RPA amplicons of the human and E.
coli large DNA libraries showed similar size distributions
as those of their small-sized library amplicons.

The genome
sequence of EcNR2 is already known; therefore, we were
able to calculate the uniformity values  of every EcNR2 genome base. Using these
uniformity values, we calculated the percentage of bases in the uniform
range (the uniformity values in a range of 0.5–1.5) to compare
the uniformity difference between samples. Thus, if the percentage
was higher, the sample was amplified more uniformly. Using the above
calculation, we calculated the percentage of uniform range of small
and large DNA libraries which showed 76.6 and 84.0% of bases in the
uniform range, respectively. By contrast, the RPA amplicons from small
and large DNA libraries showed 56.3 and 49.2%, respectively (Figure S5). We assumed that the size shift might
be due to faster amplification of small-sized DNA by RPA versus PCR.
Thus, the difference in the size-dependent amplification rate caused
biased amplification with reduced uniformity.

Linear Amplification RPA
Improves the Uniformity and Size Variation
of DNA Libraries
To solve the size shift and lower uniformity
problem, we examined single-primer linear RPA as a potential solution
to the size shift problem of DNA libraries amplified with two-primer
RPA. We hypothesized that a single primer would prevent reamplification
of the RPA amplicon by the opposite primer, blocking acceleration
of small-sized DNA amplification. Moreover, because of the strand
displacement activity of RPA, large DNA should be amplified simultaneously
in multiple strands. Taken together, to improve the size shift and
uniformity, we adopted a single-primer linear amplification strategy.30 To test our hypothesis, we amplified E. coli small (n = 3) and large
(n = 3) libraries using single-primer linear RPA,
which we refer to as linear RPA (Figure 1). After adaptor ligation and USER treatment
of E. coli libraries, 20 min of linear
RPA was performed with the P7 index primer (Table S3). A short cycle of PCR was performed with the P5 index and
P7 end primers to attach the P5 index for NGS. We confirmed the size
distribution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to performing
NGS and found broader size distributions (Figure S4) than that obtained with two-primer RPA (Figure S2). Amplified libraries were sequenced with the Illumina
NextSeq platform and analyzed as above. From the analysis result,
the size distribution and uniformity of linear RPA products were improved
compared with products from two-primer RPA (Figure 2). The average size distributions of the
triplet experiment with the small and large libraries were 56 bp and
45 bp, respectively, by RPA and 90 bp and 109 bp, respectively, by
linear RPA (Figure 2a). Also, the average percentages of bases in the uniform range (uniformity
value between 0.5 and 1.5) about the triplet experiment was improved
from 56.3 and 49.2% by two-primer RPA to 73.6 and 75.7% by linear
RPA for the small and large DNA libraries, respectively (Figures 2b and S5).

The aligned DNA size data were obtained from Sam files after BWA alignment.
(b) Violin plots show uniformity values for all replicates of #1 E. coli EcNR2 samples from Figure S5, including PCR,

which was calculated by the following equation (sequencing depth of
given position/average depth of whole EcNR2 genome). The numbers above
the plot represent the percentage of data with a uniformity value
between 0.5 and 1.5. (c) Bar plot shows the substitution error ratio
of samples. The bar plots of experimental samples were generated using
the average value for each sample; the error bar represents standard
deviation values.

Next, we analyzed the
substitution error of linear RPA products.
We calculated the error rate and substitution type and then compared
the substitution error rate with those obtained with KAPA HiFi HotStart
Ready Mix31 and NGS.32 From the result, no significant substitution error rate
differences were noted among PCR and RPA samples (Figure 2c). The substitution error
ratio of samples was similar to the NGS error ratio but not the amplification
error ratio. Thus, linear RPA improved the library amplification with
respect to size distribution and uniformity without significant substitution
error rate change.

Microarray Oligonucleotide Library Amplification
Using RPA
Linear RPA was used to overcome the bias which
occurs when amplifying
the size-variable DNA library with two primers by RPA. We wanted to
investigate whether the uniformity is low when amplifying the same-sized
DNA library by RPA. To test this, we designed and synthesized a microarray
oligonucleotide library (oligo library) with 150 bp long sequences
(Supporting Information 1). The terminal
20 bp and 30 bp at both ends were designed to contain common flanking
sequences as primer binding sites for PCR and RPA, respectively (Figure
S6, Supporting Information 1). One thousand
insert sequences with 90 bp were extracted from the genomic DNA sequence
of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. We conducted
RPA and PCR for 20 min and 25 cycles, respectively, with 20 ng oligo
library in each reaction as a template (n = 3). Agarose
gel electrophoresis showed the correct amplicon size with both methods
(Figure S7). After NGS sample preparation
with eight cycles of index attachment PCR, the samples were sequenced
using the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing data for both the
PCR and RPA oligo library amplicons were analyzed using BWA, Samtools,
and in-house python codes. We assessed the uniformity of the PCR and
RPA amplicons by calculating the uniformity value (sequencing depth
of the single oligo/average depth of all 1000 oligos) of each oligo
in the library. All replicate experiments are visualized on a dot
plot showing the uniformity values (Figure 3a). Results indicated that 77.0% of oligos
were in the uniform range (uniformity value 0.5–1.5) after
PCR amplification, and 63.2% of oligos were in the uniform range by
RPA.

Figure 3 Uniformity and correlation of amplification order between PCR and
RPA amplicons for the microarray oligonucleotide library. (a) Comparison
of uniformity values for PCR and RPA amplicons shown in a violin plot.
Y-axis represents the uniformity value, which was calculated by the
following equation (sequencing depth of given position/average depth
of whole 1000 oligoes). The numbers above the plot represent the percentage
of data with a uniformity value between 0.5 and 1.5. (b) Uniformity
value of each oligo in the descending order. The left and the right
plots were rearranged in the descending order based on PCR replicate
#1 and RPA replicate #1, respectively. (c) Correlation coefficient
value between samples using uniformity values of each oligo.

The uniformity value can also represent the order
of amplification
for each of the content in the library. Values for PCR and RPA replicates
were arranged in descending order based on the rank of PCR and RPA
replicate 1 to produce dot plots (Figure 3b). We calculated the correlation coefficient
of the uniformity values for the PCR and RPA replicates (Figure 3c). Interestingly,
the uniformity value of each of oligo content showed a different ranking
order for PCR and RPA amplicons. We did not identify the reason for
the difference in amplification preferences but believe it may be
due to the differences in polymerases used for PCR and RPA. Taken
together, the data show that RPA uniformly amplifies DNA libraries
of the same size and has different amplification preferences than
PCR.

Discussion
In this study, we introduced a novel DNA
library amplification
method based on RPA. At first, we hypothesized that RPA can be a replacement
of PCR for DNA library amplification. However, during the experiment,
an accelerated small-sized DNA amplification by two-primer RPA reaction
caused lower uniformity compared to PCR. To solve this problem, we
adapted a linear amplification strategy. We hypothesized that the
single-primer linear RPA would result in unbiased, single-stranded
DNA amplicons by the strand displacement activity of RPA. As a result,
we were able to obtain the more uniform products compared to two-primer
RPA products. Nevertheless, the size distribution was not superior
compared to PCR products. We believe that further optimization is
necessary for linear RPA to be competitive over PCR.

We also
examined the uniformity of RPA when amplifying the same-sized
oligonucleotide library. We designed and synthesized a 150 bp oligo
DNA library from the genome sequence of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. The RPA product was slightly lower than the PCR amplicons
but showed similar uniformity. It was noted that during the analysis,
different amplification preferences were found between the PCR and
RPA amplified oligo library sequencing data. The correlation coefficient
of PCR–PCR or RPA–RPA replicates was close to 1, but
the correlation coefficient of PCR–RPA showed 0.6 (Figure 3b,c). We were unable
to elucidate the reason for these different preferences, but acknowledge
that differences in RPA versus PCR polymerases may contribute.

As described above, one of the reasons why we used RPA is to reduce
the heat deamination of DNA during PCR. To prove it, we analyzed the
substitution error rate of our samples. However, the substitution
error ratio showed a similar trend as that of the NGS substitution
error rate ratio. Thus, we were not able to find any evidence that
heat-induced C to T deamination was reduced by RPA. We assumed that
the deamination error rate might be lower than the sequencing error
rate in our study.

Taken together, we show that single-primer
linear RPA can be one
of the alternative methods to PCR for DNA library amplification. Still
further optimization is needed, and we believe that the linear RPA
can be used for simultaneous amplification and barcoding with a single
oligo, resulting in shorter reaction times and milder reaction conditions
than PCR. Thus, we envision that our study will extend the scope of
RPA in the field of genomics.

Materials and Methods
PCR Conditions
All primers were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies (USA) or Macrogen (Korea) (Table S3). We used KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems,
USA) for PCR experiments. The 50 μL PCR reaction consisted of
25 μL of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix, 2.4 μL
of 10 μM forward primer, 2.4 μL of 10 μM reverse
primer, and template DNA or ddH2O (negative control). The
amplicon was purified with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

RPA Conditions
Two-primer RPA was conducted at 37 °C
with the TwistAmp Basic kit (TwistDx Limited, UK) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 25 μL of 2× Reaction Buffer, 3.68 μL
of 25 mM dNTP mix, 5 μL of 10× Basic E-mix, 2.4 μL
of 10 μM P5 primer, 2.4 μL of 10 μM P7 primer, and
44.5 μL of ddH2O were included. Samples were vortexed
and spun down, and 2.5 μL of 20× Core Reaction Mix was
added to the reaction mixture. The solution was mixed vigorously,
centrifuged, and transferred to a new dry tube. Next, 2.5 μL
of 200 mM MgOAc and 0.5 μL of template DNA were added separately
to the cap. Finally, the contents were centrifuged to start the 20
min reaction and incubated at 37 °C. Amplified DNA was purified
with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following
the manufacturer’s protocol.

For all single-primer linear
RPA reactions, everything was the same until the DNA purification
step, except replacing 2.4 μL of P5 primer with 2.4 μL
of ddH2O. After purification, linearly amplified RPA products
were subjected to eight cycles of PCR with P5 primer and end sequence
of P7 primer (Table S3).

NGS Sample
Preparation
All NGS samples were prepared
using the 5× ER/A-tailing Enzyme Mix (Enzymatics, USA) and WGS
ligase (Enzymatics, USA) without deviating from the manufacturer’s
protocol. DNA was first mixed with the ER/A-tailing enzyme mix and
incubated at 20 °C for 30 min and 65 °C for 30 min. Sequencing
adaptor (10 μL) from NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB,
USA) and WGS ligase were added to the A-tailed product. After ligation
for 30 min at 23 °C, 3 μL of USER enzyme mix (New England
BioLabs, USA) was directly mixed into the ligation tube and incubated
for 30 min at 37 °C. The USER cleaved product was then purified
using Agencourt AMPure XP beads with a 1.2× excess volume of
USER cleaved product (Beckman-Coulter, USA). The products were amplified
with either PCR or RPA using the index primer pairs provided in the
NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina kit. The product was purified
using AMPure XP beads with a 1.2× excess volume of AMPure XP
beads and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform.

Sequencing
Data Analysis
We used the AdapterRemoval,27 BWA,28 SAMtools,29 and in-house python scripts to analyze read
counts, sequencing depths, and uniformities of each library.

Generation
of Human and E. coli Genomic DNA Library
In this study, we used five different
DNA libraries. Four were generated by random shearing of human NA12878
and E. coli EcNR226 genomic DNA. Human NA12878 genomic DNA was purchased from
the Coriell Institute (USA). E. coli EcNR2 strain was incubated in Luria–Bertani media (BD Biosciences,
USA) at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. After harvesting EcNR2
cells by centrifugation, we precipitated the genomic DNA using the
GeneAll Exgene Cell SV Kit (GeneAll, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Both genomic DNAs were sheared into 180 bp and 300 bp fragments
using a M220 focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, USA). The size of sheared
DNA was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis and an Agilent 4200
TapeStation system (Agilent, USA).

Design and Synthesis of
the Microarray Oligonucleotide Library
The microarray oligonucleotide
library was designed to have a thousand
unique 150 bp sequences and synthesized with the DNA microarray synthesizer
(CustomArray, USA). Each sequence possessed a 30 bp flanking sequence
at both sides, which is complementary to the RPA primer. The terminal
20 bp at each end sequence possessed a Tm value near 60 °C, enabling their use as a primer pair for PCR.
