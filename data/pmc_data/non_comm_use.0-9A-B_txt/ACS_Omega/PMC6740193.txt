Drug
resistance in bacteria is a serious threat, and drugs with
novel modes of action are constantly needed. Fosmidomycin is a naturally
occurring antibiotic that inhibits the nonmevalonate pathway via inhibition
of the enzyme 1-deoxylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR). This
work is the first report in which a boronic acid is evaluated as an
isostere of the retrohydroxamate moiety of fosmidomycin. We report
the novel synthesis of a γ-borono phosphonate analog of fosmidomycin
and its corresponding prodrugs. We evaluate the inhibition of DXR
and the antimicrobial activity of γ-borono phosphonate compounds
against Escherichia coli wild type, E. coli Δglycerol-3-phosphate transporter,
and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Despite
its structural similarities, the γ-borono phosphonate compound
shows antimicrobial activity against E. coli with a mechanism of action that is different from fosmidomycin.
This was proven with an underutilized method for studying in vitro
inhibition of the MEP pathway in E. coli via isopentenyl pyrophosphate chemical rescue. These results indicate
that these compounds may serve as a promising scaffold for developing
a new class of antimicrobial agents.

Introduction
Antimicrobial drug
resistance is a worldwide threat to public health.1 According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), two million people contract antibiotic-resistant
infections and 23 000 die every year in the U.S. alone.2 An infectious disease that affects people worldwide
is tuberculosis (TB). According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
10 million people died worldwide in 2017 due to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) infections.3 Even though TB is typically detectable and treatable, the development
of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains of Mtb requires
the continuous development of new drugs and the discovery of new drug
targets.4,5

A novel target that has been proposed
recently is the nonmevalonate
pathway (MEP) (Figure 1).6 This pathway is essential because
it leads to the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an isoprenoid
building block that is required for the biosynthesis of many biomolecules
essential to the life cycle of many pathogens such as Mtb and Escherichia coli.7,8 Additionally,
the MEP pathway is not present in humans since mammals use the mevalonate
pathway for the synthesis of IPP. Therefore, enzymes within the MEP
pathway make attractive targets for the development of new antimicrobial
agents.9

Figure 1 MEP pathway and inhibition of 1-deoxylulose-5-phosphate
reductoisomerase
(DXR) with fosmidomycin.

A natural product able
to inhibit the MEP pathway is fosmidomycin
(1, Figure 1).10 Fosmidomycin is a low nanomolar inhibitor
of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR),
the first committed step of the MEP pathway.11 In the DXR active site, the phosphonate group of fosmidomycin interacts
through noncovalent interactions with serine and lysine residues,
while the retrohydroxamic acid portion is coordinated in a bidentate
fashion with the divalent metal Mg2+.6 Although it shows potent in vitro activity, the polar character
of fosmidomycin renders it membrane-impermeable.12,13 However, in pathogens such as E. coli, the active uptake of fosmidomycin is mediated by the glycerol-3-phosphate
transporter (GlpT) and fosmidomycin resistance in E.
coli can be caused by a mutation in GlpT.14,15 Fosmidomycin effectively inhibits mycobacterial DXR, yet it is not
active against these organisms due to the highly hydrophobic mycobacterial
cell wall and the absence of a corresponding GlpT transporter.16 Several studies have reported on the synthesis
of various analogs of fosmidomycin to address its unfavorable pharmacokinetic
properties.17−20 One approach carried out by Larhed et al. was to replace the retrohydroxamic
acid moiety of fosmidomycin with alternative metal-coordinating groups.21 Particularly, they investigated the use of catechol
and hydroxypyridinone as hydroxamic acid isosteres. This interaction
is important for establishing the inhibition of DXR since it coordinates
with the divalent metal Mg2+ present in the DXR active
site. Even though these compounds showed modest inhibition against
MtbDXR, they exhibited no activity against the whole organism.21

To date, isosteric replacement of the
retrohydroxamic acid group
with a boronic acid has not been investigated. In this work, we evaluate
the substitution of the retrohydroxamate group with a boronic acid
moiety (Figure 2).
Boronic acids possess a similar geometry to retrohydroxamic acids
and can act as metal-binding chelators. Thus, we hypothesize that
the boronic acid can act as an alternate metal chelator in the DXR
active site. Additionally, boronic acids can be masked as labile,
lipophilic esters, which may provide an avenue to produce novel, membrane-permeable
fosmidomycin analogs.

(POM) γ-borono MIDA phosphonate 7.

Recently, boronic acids have been gaining the attention of
the
pharmaceutical industry. Currently, there are five FDA-approved drugs
containing boron on the market: Kerydin, Velcade, Ninlaro, Vabomere,
and Eucrisa.22−27 Kerydin is an antifungal, which contains a benzoxaborole ring. It
acts as an inhibitor of cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase, thus blocking
the protein synthesis.22 Vabomere is a
drug cocktail, and the active ingredient that contains boron is vaborbactam,
which can act as a reversible covalent inhibitor of KPC-2 β-lactamase.23 Velcade and Ninlaro are antitumor drugs. They
both contain the boronic acid group and act as proteasome inhibitors.24,25

Eucrisa (crisaborole) is used for the treatment of atopic
dermatitis
and is of particular interest in this respect since the boronic acid
moiety acts as a metal chelator when inhibiting phosphodiesterase
4 (PDE4).26 It contains a benzoxaborole
ring, and the free hydroxyl group interacts in the hydrate form with
the divalent metals, Mn2+ and Zn2+, present
in the active site of PDE4.27 Another example
of a boron-containing compound where the boronic acid moiety acts
as a metal-binding inhibitor is 2-S-amino-6-boronohexanoic
acid (ABH).28 Specifically, ABH is an inhibitor
of arginase I where the boronic acid coordinates with Mg2+ in the active site of arginase I. ABH-based boronic acid inhibitors
are currently in phase I and II clinical trials.27,28

With the γ-borono phosphonate compound, we have the
possibility
to enhance the lipophilic character of the library by modification
of both the negatively charged phosphonate group and the boronic acid
moiety. The boronic acid can be masked with N-methyl
iminodiacetic acid (MIDA), which is known for its ability to slowly
release the free boronic acid via aqueous hydrolysis (compounds 5–7, Figure 2).29 Incorporation
of the pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) ester group is a commonly used approach
for phosphonate prodrugs (compound 7, Figure 2).30 Labile phosphonate ester prodrugs are present in several FDA-approved
drugs, e.g., Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread (tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate).31,32 These phosphonate ester moieties
are cleaved by nonspecific esterases to produce the free phosphonic
acids.33 An alternate approach that we
evaluated is the esterification of the phosphonate group as a bisbenzyl
ester (compound 5, Figure 2). In contrast with the POM groups, the hydrolysis
of the bisbenzyl group is spontaneous and pH-dependent.34

Herein, we describe the results of incorporating
a boronic acid
group as a metal-chelating, isosteric replacement for the retrohydroxamic
acid moiety for the inhibition of DXR. We achieved the synthesis of
a γ-borono phosphonate analog (4) of fosmidomycin
and evaluated its inhibition of E. coli DXR. Additionally, to increase the lipophilic character of 4, we synthesized several prodrugs via lipophilic protection
of both the phosphonate and boronic acid moieties (Figure 2). We evaluated the antimicrobial
activity against E. coli WT (BW25113), E. coli ΔGlpT (JW2234-2), and M. smegmatis (as a surrogate organism for Mtb).35−37 Finally, we investigated the mechanism of action of these unique
compounds.

Results
Synthesis of the γ-Borono Phosphonate
Analogs
The synthetic route for the γ-borono phosphonate 4 is described in Scheme 1. The boron electrophile is synthesized by the hydroboration
of 3-bromopropene in an efficient, one-pot method developed in our
lab.38 Boron trichloride and triethyl silane
allow the in situ production of dichloroborane for hydroboration.
Exposure of this intermediate to water followed by potassium hydrogen
fluoride provides for hydrolysis to the boronic acid and subsequent
conversion to the trifluoroborate salt. Without further purification,
compound 2 was used as an electrophile for the introduction
of the boronic acid in the final product. Substitution on 2 with dibenzyl phosphonate yielded 3 in a 50% yield.
Next, deprotection of the phosphonate esters with boron trichloride
provided the desired γ-borono phosphonate 4 in
a 63% yield.

In an attempt to enhance membrane
permeability and, potentially,
activity against M. smegmatis, we synthesized
lipophilic prodrugs of 4 (Scheme 2). The synthetic route for prodrug 7 (Scheme 2) starts with compound 3, where the boron functionality
is protected with MIDA to form 5. Hydrogenolysis of compound 5 allowed the elimination of the benzyl ester functionality
and the synthesis of compound 6 in a 72% yield. Without
further purification, 6 was coupled with pivaloyloxymethyl
chloride to give 7 in a 42% yield.

Compound 4 Is a Relatively Poor Inhibitor of E. coli DXR
Compound 4 was
evaluated as an inhibitor of recombinant E. coli DXR. Different concentrations of analog 4 were incubated
with DXR and NADPH at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated with
the addition of the natural substrate DXP, and the disappearance of
NADPH was monitored at 340 nm.11 From this
data, initial rates were determined and plotted vs the inhibitor concentration.
We determined that the fosmidomycin IC50 is 0.049 ±
0.007 μM. This result is consistent with the literature value
(IC50 0.032 μM).11 The
IC50 for compound 4 was determined to be 128
± 3 μM (Figure 3).

Compound 4 and the Borono
Prodrug 6 Showed Significant Antimicrobial Activity against
Both E. coli WT and ΔGlpT Strains
The antimicrobial
activity for all of the γ-borono phosphonate analogs was evaluated
by the microdilution assay against E. coli strains BW25113 and JW2234-2 and M. smegmatis.39 In general, each strain was grown
overnight and then diluted to an initial OD600 of 0.05.
Different concentrations of the analogs were incubated at 37 °C,
for 18 h in E. coli and for 30 h in M. smegmatis. The concentration of the inhibitor,
which reduced bacterial growth by 90%, was determined to be the MIC90 (Table 1).
None of the compounds tested, including our lipophilic prodrugs, showed
any activity against M. smegmatis.
However, our antimicrobial evaluation of compounds 4 and 6 against E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT showed that they have a reasonable
activity against both strains and a mechanism of cellular penetration
that is independent of the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter and thus
are unique from fosmidomycin.

Exogenous Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate
(IPP) Has a Dose-Dependent
Effect on the Rescue of E. coli WT
Growth Inhibited by the MEP Pathway Inhibitor Fosmidomycin
The concentration of isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) necessary for
the rescue experiment was determined for E. coli WT (BW25113). This strain was grown overnight and then diluted to
an initial OD600 of 0.05. The E. coli WT was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with varied concentrations
of IPP in the presence of two fixed concentrations of fosmidomycin.
An effective concentration of IPP for the rescue of fosmidomycin-inhibited E. coli growth was determined to be 125 μM
(Figure 4). This experiment
proves that E. coli is capable of utilizing
IPP from the media to relieve MEP pathway inhibition. With this tool,
we next developed a chemical rescue assay that will prove useful in
the study of MEP pathway inhibitors in vitro in E.
coli.

IPP concentration of 125 μM is used in the E.
coli rescue assay (n = 3).

E. coli Chemical
Rescue Experiments
Reveal That Compounds 4 and 6 Do Not Inhibit
the MEP Pathway
IPP chemical rescue experiments for E. coli growth inhibited by fosmidomycin or our compounds
were completed for the E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT (strains BW25113 and JW2234-2,
respectively).40 Each strain was grown
overnight and then diluted to an initial OD600 of 0.05.
Different concentrations of fosmidomycin, 4, or 6 were incubated with the bacterium in the presence or absence
of 125 μM IPP for 18 h at 37 °C. In the presence of fosmidomycin,
the addition of IPP led to the restoration of E. coli growth (Figure 5A).
However, in the presence of 4 or 6, the
addition of IPP did not restore bacterial growth (Figures 5B,C and S19). These results indicate that the γ-borono phosphonate
analogs are acting on a target outside of the nonmevalonate pathway
and thus have a mechanism of action that is unique from fosmidomycin.

with IPP. (A) E. coli WT was treated
with different concentrations of fosmidomycin for 18 h with and without
the addition of 125 μM IPP in LB media. (B, C) E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT were treated with different concentrations of 4 for 18 h with and without the addition of 125 μM IPP
in LB media (n = 3). These rescue experiments were
also performed with compound 6, and similar results were
obtained (Figure S19).

Discussion
Compound 4 was evaluated as an inhibitor
of recombinant E. coli DXR but showed
only modest inhibition (128
μM), unlike fosmidomycin (0.049 μM). However, in comparison
to most of the analogs previously synthesized by Larhed et al.,21 compound 4 is a stronger inhibitor
of DXR. The best retrohydroxamic acid replacement reported in their
work, the catechol substitution, had a 41 μM EC50 against MtbDXR. Even though the boronic acid and the retrohydroxamate
group have similar geometries, our result indicates that the boronic
acid is a weaker metal chelator than the retrohydroxamic acid group.
This effect can be explained by the different resonance characteristics
for the boronic acid and retrohydroxamate moieties. The retrohydroxamic
acid possesses a double-bond character that favors the coordination
between the lone pair of the oxygen and the metal, whereas the boron
atom has an empty p orbital, which makes it a strong Lewis acid.41 This characteristic renders the boron–oxygen
bonds partially double-bonded; however, the lone-pair electrons of
the oxygens are less available to coordinate with the metal because
they are also interacting with the empty p orbital on the boron center.
It is expected that the anionic, boronate form would be much more
strongly metal-chelating as is observed with crisaborole.

Since
modest DXR inhibition was observed, we evaluated the antimicrobial
activity of 4 against E. coli WT, E. coli ΔGlpT, and M. smegmatis (Table 1). It is known that M. smegmatis is not a perfect analog for M. tuberculosis, yet metabolic pathways (including MEP) and cell wall properties
are similar in both species.42,43 The DXR sequence is
∼79% identical between these two species, and sensitivity to
fosmidomycin is similar.44−46

Our results show that 4 inhibited in vitro growth
of both E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT, unlike fosmidomycin. E. coli ΔGlpT is inherently resistant to fosmidomycin
due to compromised membrane transport, yet this strain is not resistant
to 4. This indicates that compound 4 is
crossing the cell wall of E. coli by
passive diffusion or is able to utilize a different transporter. Despite
these promising results, 4 is inactive against M. smegmatis, probably due to its inability to cross
the mycobacterial cell wall. The mycobacterial cell wall is different
from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, since they possess a high concentration
of lipids that make the passive diffusion of polar compounds more
difficult.47

In an attempt to enhance
membrane permeability and, potentially,
activity against M. smegmatis, we synthesized
lipophilic prodrugs of 4 and evaluated their antimicrobial
effects and determined their calculated log P values (Scheme 2 and Table 1). With these boronic
acid-containing compounds, we have the ability of introducing a double
prodrug by masking both the highly charged phosphonate moiety and
the boronic acid group. Phosphonates can be modified with the use
of pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) or bisbenzyl ester functionalities. The
use of the POM group in the synthesis of phosphonate prodrugs is already
established.30 The cleavage of POM in vivo
is driven by nonspecific esterases, while the hydrolysis of the bisbenzyl
ester group is pH-dependent and naturally faster in an acidic environment.33,34 The boronic acid can be masked using methyl iminodiacetic acid (MIDA).
MIDA is typically used as a protecting group for boronic acids because
it is known for its capacity to slowly release free boronic acid.29

First, we wanted to evaluate the protection
of the boronic acid
group in isolation. Antimicrobial evaluation of 6 confirmed
the results obtained with 4 (Table 1). Compounds 4 and 6 are equipotent against E. coli WT
and E. coli ΔGlpT, while neither
have any relevant activity against M. smegmatis. Therefore, the introduction of MIDA neither enhanced nor hindered
the activity or membrane permeability. We would like to note, however,
that the incorporation of the MIDA group may be useful for formulation
purposes since it improved the solubility of the analog and should
provide increased chemical stability.29

Next, the effects of phosphonate-masking in combination with
boronic
acid protection were evaluated. Compounds 5 and 7 show no antimicrobial activity against either strain of E. coli or M. smegmatis. These results are consistent with the work of Ponaire et al. when
they investigated the antimicrobial effects of propyloxymethyl ester
prodrugs of fosmidomycin and FR900098.44 Their fosmidomycin/FR900098 prodrugs were unable to inhibit the
growth of E. coli WT at all and only
inhibited the growth of M. smegmatis at the very highest concentrations evaluated. Dowd et al. tested
the hypothesis that efflux pumps were responsible for the export of
these lipophilic prodrugs and their subsequent lack of activity.48 They tested POM-FR900098 against E. coli with a deletion in the function of the efflux
pump (E. coli tolC). They reported
an increase in antimicrobial activity for POM-FR900098 against E. coli tolC compared to the MIC value against E. coli WT. Therefore, compounds 5 and 7, with no significant activity against E.
coli WT, E. coli ΔGlpT,
or M. smegmatis, are likely suffering
from the same limitations or a complete inability to release the active
compound under the assay conditions.

Given the low affinity
to DXR and the structural similarity of
our compound to other metabolites within the MEP pathway, we wanted
to independently evaluate compound 4 as a potential inhibitor
for any step within the MEP pathway. This was achieved with a chemical
rescue experiment utilizing IPP, the end product of the MEP pathway.40 Recent work provided some evidence that IPP,
a multiply-charged diphosphate species, is able to cross the membrane
in E. coli via an unknown mechanism.49 We confirmed these findings by observing that
fosmidomycin-induced growth inhibition was relieved by the supplementation
of the E. coli growth media with IPP.
Exogenous IPP was able to restore E. coli growth in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4). With fosmidomycin, which targets the DXR
enzyme within the MEP pathway, the presence of IPP in the media results
in the rescue of E. coli’s growth
(Figure 5A). This experiment
thus provides a ready assay for the rapid determination of the mechanism
of action for MEP pathway inhibitors in E. coli. To evaluate the mechanism of action of compound 4,
this rescue experiment was done on both E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT (Figure 5B,C, respectively).
In both sets of experiments, the addition of IPP to the media did
not restore growth. These results indicate that the target of 4 is not any of the enzymes that are involved in the MEP pathway.
Similar results were obtained for the borono prodrug 6 (Figure S19).

In conclusion, this
work describes the synthesis and the antimicrobial
evaluation of a novel class of antimicrobial agents, γ-borono
phosphonates. These compounds were rationally designed analogs of
the natural product fosmidomycin. This work is the first report of
evaluating a boronic acid as an isostere of the metal-chelating retrohydroxamate
moiety. DXR inhibition by 4 was considerably weaker than
with fosmidomycin, indicating that this alkyl boronic acid group is
suboptimal in this application, which requires strong metal chelation.
None of the compounds tested, including our lipophilic prodrugs, showed
any activity against M. smegmatis.
However, our antimicrobial evaluation of these compounds against E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT showed that they have a reasonable activity against
both strains and a mechanism of action that is unique from fosmidomycin.
We have proven that these compounds are independent of the glycerol-3-phosphate
transporter and are acting on a target outside of the nonmevalonate
pathway. In addition, we have confirmed that E. coli is capable of utilizing exogenous IPP to relieve MEP pathway inhibition.
Using this finding, we developed a chemical rescue assay that will
prove useful in the study of MEP pathway inhibitors in vitro in E. coli. Elucidation of the mechanism of action and
further structure–activity relationship studies are ongoing
to improve the antimicrobial activity of this class of γ-borono
phosphonate compounds.

Materials and Methods
General Procedures
All reactants and reagents were
purchased commercially and used without further purification unless
otherwise indicated. Reactions were carried out under a dry, inert
atmosphere of argon or nitrogen unless otherwise indicated. “Concentrated”

A dry, Ar-flushed round-bottom flask
in a glovebox was charged with pure sodium hydride (1.10 equiv, 15.79
mmol). The flask was removed from the glovebox, and then dibenzyl
phosphonate (1 equiv, 14.35 mmol) was dissolved in dry DMF (6 mL)
and transferred into the reaction vessel at 0 °C. The suspension
was stirred for 2 h at rt. Next, the reaction vessel was cooled to
0 °C, and a solution of 3-bromo propyl trifluoroborate potassium
salt (1 equiv, 14.35 mmol) in dry DMF (3 mL) was added. The solution
was warmed to rt and stirred overnight. The following day, the reaction
was quenched with water at 0 °C and extracted three times with
ethyl acetate. The organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The product was purified via
column chromatography (95:5 EtOAc/EtOH) to give a white solid with
a 50% yield.

Synthesis of 3-Borono Propyl Phosphonic Acid (4)
A dry, Ar-flushed round-bottom flask was charged with 3 (1 equiv, 0.92 mmol) and dry DCM (1 mL). To this mixture
was added a solution of 1 M boron trichloride in DCM (10 equiv, 1.92

h and gently warmed up to rt over this time. The reaction was quenched
with water (10 mL) at 0 °C, and the biphasic solution was stirred
for 30 min at rt. Then, the solution was transferred to a separatory
funnel, and the aqueous phase was washed three times with DCM and
then frozen and lyophilized. This crude product was triturated with
methanol, and the organic phase was concentrated to give the pure
product as a white solid in a 63% yield.

Synthesis of the (3-(Bis(benzyloxy)phosphoryl)
propyl) MIDA
Boronate (5)
A dry, Ar-flushed round-bottom
flask was charged with 3 (1 equiv, 0.35 mmol), toluene
(10 mL), and DMSO (1 mL). Methyl iminodiacetic acid (2 equiv, 0.70
mmol) was added to the solution. The flask was fitted with a Dean-Stark
trap and condenser, and the resulting suspension was refluxed overnight.
The suspension was then filtered. The filtrate was diluted with ethyl
acetate and washed with a saturated solution of ammonium chloride
in water. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to provide the pure product as colorless
oil in an 83% yield.

Enzyme Assay of E. coli DXR (11)
His-tagged E. coli DXR obtained was overexpressed and purified as reported.52 The DXR enzymatic activity was determined at
37 °C in HEPES (50 mM, pH 8.0), MgCl2 (2 mM), NADPH
(0.15 mM), TCEP (0.5 mM), BSA (1 mg/mL), DXR (0.001 μM), and
different concentrations of inhibitor (from 0.5 to 500 μM) in
a final volume of 1 mL. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 min
at 37 °C prior to initiation with the substrate DXP (0.08 mM).
Initial rates were monitored at 340 nm (Cary 300 UV–vis, Agilent)
following the decrease of NADPH over 2.5 min. Data were fitted using
Origin 2016 64Bit.

E. coli Growth
Inhibition Assay
(33)
Minimal inhibitory concentrations 90% (MIC90) were determined for the E. coli strains BW25113 and JW2234-2 by microdilution. Each strain was grown
overnight and then diluted to an initial OD600 (Eppendorf
BioPhotomer) of 0.05. A concentration gradient of each inhibitor (from
5 to 1000 μM) was created and aliquoted into the assay plate
(Corning, 96-well clear flat-bottom polystyrene not-treated microplate,
with low evaporation lid, sterile). In general, the 96-well plates
were prepared by dispensing 135 μL of inoculum, sterile water,
and inhibitor to a final volume of 150 μL. Compounds not soluble
in water were dissolved in DMSO. The plates included a sterility check
(water, medium, and DMSO), negative control (medium, water, DMSO,
and inoculum), positive control (medium, water, DMSO, inoculum, 25
and 50 μg/mL of kanamycin, and 25 and 50 μg/mL of ampicillin).
The plates were incubated at 37 °C, shaking at 300 rpm for 18
h and then read at 600 nm (Synergy H1 Microplate Readers Biotek).
The concentration of the inhibitor, which reduced bacterial growth
by 90%, was determined to be the MIC90. Data were fitted
using Origin 2016 64Bit.

M. smegmatis Inhibition Assay
(33)
Minimal inhibitory concentrations 90% (MIC90) were determined for M. smegmatis by microdilution. M. smegmatis was
grown at 37 °C overnight in 7H9 medium and supplemented with
OADC and 1% Tween 20 at 37 °C. The overnight culture was diluted
to an initial OD600 (Eppendorf BioPhotomer) of 0.05 with
7H9 and 1.5% Tween 80. A concentration gradient of each inhibitor
(from 5 to 1000 μM) was created and aliquoted into the assay
plate (Corning, 96-well clear flat-bottom polystyrene not-treated
microplate, with low evaporation lid, sterile). Compounds not soluble
in water were dissolved in DMSO. In general, the 96-well plates were
prepared by dispensing 135 μL of inoculum, sterile water, and
inhibitor to a final volume of 150 μL. The plates included a
sterility check (water, medium, and DMSO), negative control (medium,
water, DMSO, and inoculum), positive control (medium, water, DMSO,
inoculum, 5 μg/mL of isoniazid, and 10 μg/mL of isoniazid).
The plates were incubated at 37 °C, shaking at 300 rpm for 30
h and then read at 600 nm (Synergy H1 Microplate Reader Biotek). The
concentration of the inhibitor, which reduced bacterial growth by
90%, was determined to be the MIC90. Data were fitted using
Origin 2016 64Bit.

Dose-Dependent Effect of Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate
(IPP) on
Rescue of E. coli WT Growth
The concentration of isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) for the rescue
experiment was determined for E. coli WT. E. coli WT was grown overnight and diluted to an initial OD600 (Eppendorf BioPhotometer) of 0.05. A concentration gradient
of IPP (from 125 to 750 μM) and two concentrations for fosmidomycin
(5 and 25 μM) were created and aliquoted into the assay plate
(Corning, 96-well clear flat-bottom polystyrene not-treated microplate,
with low evaporation lid, sterile). In general, the 96-well plates
were prepared by dispensing 135 μL of inoculum, 2 μL of
fosmidomycin, IPP, and sterile water to a final volume of 200 μL.
The plates included a sterility check (water and medium), negative
control (medium, water, and inoculum), positive control (medium, water,
inoculum, 25 and 50 μg/mL of kanamycin, and 25 and 50 μg/mL
of ampicillin). The plates were incubated at 37 °C, shaking at
300 rpm for 18 h and then read at 600 nm (BioTek Synergy Microplate
Reader). Data were fitted using Origin 2016 64Bit.

E. coli Chemical Rescue Assay
These experiments
were adapted from those previously reported for
malaria.54,55 The IPP chemical rescue experimental conditions
for E. coli inhibited by fosmidomycin
or our compounds were determined for the E. coli WT and E. coli ΔGlpT (strains
BW25113 and JW2234-2, respectively). Each strain was grown overnight
and then diluted to an initial OD600 (Eppendorf BioPhotomer)
of 0.05. A concentration gradient of each inhibitor (from 0.05 to
100 μM for fosmidomycin in E. coli WT; from 25 to 500 μM for compound 4 in E. coli WT; from 50 to 500 μM for compound 4 in E. coli ΔGlpT) was
created and aliquoted into the assay plate (Corning, 96-well clear
flat-bottom polystyrene not-treated microplate, with low evaporation
lid, sterile). In general, the 96-well plates were prepared by dispensing
135 μL of inoculum, sterile water, inhibitor, and 3.5 μL
of IPP to a final volume of 200 μL. Compounds not soluble in
water were dissolved in DMSO. The plates included a sterility check
(water, medium, and DMSO), negative control (medium, water, DMSO,
and inoculum), positive control (medium, water, DMSO, inoculum, 25
and 50 μg/mL of kanamycin, and 25 and 50 μg/mL of ampicillin).
The plates were incubated at 37 °C, shaking at 300 rpm for 18
h and then read at 600 nm (Synergy H1 Microplate Reader Biotek). Data
were fitted using Origin 2016 64Bit.
