Light-chain (AL)-associated
amyloidosis is a systemic disorder
involving the formation and deposition of immunoglobulin AL fibrils
in various bodily organs. One severe instance of AL disease
is exhibited by the patient-derived variable domain (VL) of the light chain AL-09, a 108 amino acid residue protein containing
seven mutations relative to the corresponding germline protein, κI
O18/O8 VL. Previous work has demonstrated that the thermodynamic
stability of native AL-09 VL is greatly lowered by two
of these mutations, Y87H and N34I, whereas a third mutation, K42Q,
further increases the kinetics of fibril formation. However, detailed
knowledge regarding the residues that are responsible for stabilizing
the misfolded fibril structure is lacking. In this study, using solid-state
NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of the AL-09 VL sequence is immobilized in the fibrils and that the N- and C-terminal
portions of the sequence are particularly well-structured. Thus, AL-09
VL forms an extensively ordered and β-strand-rich
fibril structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predominant
β-sheet secondary structure and rigidity
observed for in vitro prepared AL-09 VL fibrils are qualitatively
similar to those observed for AL fibrils extracted from postmortem
human spleen tissue, suggesting that this conformation may be representative
of a common feature of AL fibrils.

==== Body
Introduction
Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis
is a severe form of systemic amyloidosis
arising from the misfolding and deposition of immunoglobulin light
chains as fibrils in the extracellular matrix of major organs throughout
the human body, targeting sites such as the heart, kidneys, liver,
spleen, and peripheral nerves.1 The average
prognosis for AL disease patients varies depending on which organ
is affected, generally ranging from 2 to 3 years but dropping to below
1 year if the site of fibril deposition is the heart.2−4 Furthermore, recent work has shown that the accumulation of AL fibrils
around cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro may lead to cellular internalization
of the fibrils and subsequent cell death by interrupting cell growth,5 possibly through affecting normal metabolic function.6 Devastatingly, the number of cardiac-afflicted
AL patients accounts for approximately 50% of all AL disease cases,
and despite ongoing efforts to more effectively hinder AL aggregation,7−9 the availability of therapy options remains severely limited and
primarily targets the plasma cell population secreting the pathogenic
protein.1−4

AL misfolding in AL disease presents a particularly interesting
case of amyloidosis in that the fibril-forming light chain generally
differs by a few mutations among patients because of
the natural introduction of somatic mutations during the process of
generating a wide variety of antibodies.10 One severe instance of cardiac AL disease is exhibited by the variable
domain (VL) of light-chain protein AL-09 (derived from
patient AL-09),2 which differs from its
germline counterpart (κI O18/O8 VL) by seven somatic
mutations (Figure 1A).11 Three of these mutations are nonconservative,
Y87H, N34I, and K42Q, and are found to promote the propensity and
rate of fibril formation at least in part by contributing a significant
destabilizing effect on the native, soluble dimer form of AL-09 VL.10 In addition, previous studies
on the soluble dimer structures of AL-09 VL and κI
O18/O8 VL have demonstrated that the interface of AL-09
VL is twisted by 90° relative to the germline dimer
interface and is the site at which the three nonconservative mutations
are located (Figure 1C,D).1,11 Indeed, these observations strongly suggest
that the presence of these nonconservative mutations in AL-09 VL contributes to the protein’s amyloidogenicity by distorting
the VL–VL interface of the soluble dimer
structure. Furthermore, solution-state NMR studies on closely related
VL’s have demonstrated that the residues located
at the dimer interface are predisposed to exhibiting a greater conformational
flexibility relative to that of residues at most regions outside the
interface, particularly under destabilizing conditions, thus implying
that increased dynamics also contributes to the fibril-forming propensity.12,13 However, there remains limited knowledge on the extent and manner
of influence that the different regions of the light-chain VL have on stabilizing the final fibril form.

are in bold.14 (B) Averaged secondary 13C chemical shifts, ΔδC, plotted for each assigned
residue in AL-09 VL fibrils. Values below or above the
average random coil chemical shift values.16 δCcoil values (i.e., ΔδC < 0 or
ΔδC > 0 ppm) correspond to a β-strand or an α-helix
secondary structure, respectively. (C, D) Crystallographic structures
of the soluble dimer forms of the germline κI O18/O8 and AL-09
VL’s, respectively.11 The mutation sites in AL-09 are drawn in red.

In pursuit of this interest, here we investigate the secondary
structure and relative dynamics of AL-09 VL fibrils at
the residue-specific level by magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state
NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, we demonstrate through chemical
shift and dipolar coupling analyses that the majority of the residues
in AL-09 VL fibrils are highly rigid and exhibit primarily
a β-strand secondary structure. Moreover, our results reveal
that most of the uniquely assigned rigid residues are located near
the N- and the C-termini (i.e., before N30 and after L94) and maintain
a high degree of structural order and homogeneity at a site-specific
level. These observations also demonstrate notable structural differences
between the fibril and soluble forms of AL-09 VL, such
as residues Y32–Q38 and K45–D50, which are ordered as
a β-sheet in the dimer crystal structure (Figure 1D) but are not observed site specifically
in the fibril form (Figure 1A,B). By contrast, residues S12–V15 and L94–T97
are observed as β-strands in the fibril form but fall on the
outside of β-strands in the soluble form (Figure 1). Finally, we show that the recombinantly
generated AL-09 VL fibrils studied here exhibit global
structural features similar to those of AL fibrils directly extracted
from human spleen tissue (referred to as HIG), supporting both the
physiological relevance of our SSNMR studies and the possibility of
identifying a structural motif that is common to all AL fibrils. Together,
these results provide detailed insight into the extensive and unique
structure of a toxic AL fibril, thus informing on the structure-based
search for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for AL disease.

Results
and Discussion
AL-09 VL Fibrils Exhibit an Extensive
and β-Strand-Rich
Structured Region
On the basis of the resonance assignments
for approximately half of the protein sequence for AL-09 VL fibrils (BMRB 26879) and observation of approximately 70 spin systems
(the majority of which have been identified at the amino acid (aa)-specific
level),14 we pursued an analysis of the
corresponding secondary structure and dynamics. In addition to obtaining
initial insight into the secondary structure content of the fibril
species through chemical-shift-based predictions of the backbone dihedral
angles using TALOS-N15 (Figure S1A),14 we performed secondary 13C chemical shift (Δδ) calculations for residues
in which the 13Cα, 13C′, and/or 13Cβ chemical shifts are assigned (Figure 1B).16 Here, we
report the averaged value of Δδ for each residue. Collectively,
these 13C Δδ values inform on the type of secondary
structure that a protein region exhibits—values close to zero
indicate random coil (unstructured), whereas positive and negative
values indicate α-helical and β-strand structures, respectively.16 As illustrated in Figure 1B, the large majority of uniquely assigned
residues are predicted to exhibit a β-sheet secondary structure,
consistent with our refined TALOS-N predictions as well as findings
typically observed for other fibrils.14,17

In addition
to providing secondary structure information, the dipolar coupling-based
SSNMR 13C–13C and 15N–13C correlation experiments report on the relative dynamics
across the sequence of AL-09 VL in its fibril state, with
cross-polarization (CP) emphasizing the rigid regions. Thus, a comparison
of the relative CP intensities obtained from these experiments for
different residues in AL-09 VL fibrils offers a qualitative
measure of their corresponding rigidity. Here, we used the relative 13Cα–15N–13C′
(CANCO) peak heights of assigned AL-09 VL residues to inform
on the site-to-site variation of rigidity across the sequence of the
fibril species (Figure S1B). Our results
reveal that the majority of the assigned regions of AL-09 VL exhibit CP intensities greater than 50% of the maximum peak height
for residues with nonoverlapping signals. These residues are spread
across the majority of the AL-09 VL sequence. Additionally,
the general increase in intensity from residue Q6 to L11 and the subsequent
decrease from I21 to D28 suggest that Q6 is near the beginning of
its associated β-strand, whereas D28 is near the end and that
the flanking residues may be on the periphery of the highly ordered
region.

We further assessed the relative dynamics of AL-09 VL fibrils through a series of 15N–13Cα
(NCA) two-dimensional (2D) experiments at temperatures below, near,
and above the phase-transition temperatures (−30, −10,
and +20 °C) of the bulk water in the samples (Figures 2A and S2). It is well known from a variety of amyloid systems that
upon freezing the bulk water the CP intensity increases for the residues
in mobile regions and disordered portions of the sequence exhibit
broader signals at the lower temperature.18−20 The NCA 2D
spectrum provides multiple uniquely resolved cross-peaks corresponding
to a wide range of residues over the AL-09 VL sequence;
thus, these experiments allow for the temperature dependence of fibril
rigidity to be assessed by monitoring the changes in the signal-to-noise
ratio and line width of each peak. Accordingly, the sensitivity and
resolution of 11 resolved 15N–13Cα
cross-peaks were measured at each temperature (T0, G16, D17, I21,
A25, S26, S67, T85, Y96, G99, and T102). These results demonstrate
a consistent number of resolvable peaks for all temperatures, with
only slight increases in the average line width from +20 to −30
°C (13 ± 8 Hz, 15N dimension; 8 ± 19 Hz, 13Cα dimension) and decreases in the signal-to-noise
ratio (26 ± 15% lower on average). This finding indicates that
the AL-09 VL fibril structure remains highly ordered across
a wide range of temperatures and that this order is consistently maintained
for the approximately 70 spin systems observed in total.14

2D spectra
with short contact times recorded at +20 °C (red) and −30
°C (blue). Individual spectra are shown in Figure S2. (B, C) 1Hα–13Cα dipolar coupling line shapes obtained from 2D T-MREV experiments
at +20 °C (red), −10 °C (black), and −30 °C
(blue) are plotted along ω1/(2π) from −5.0
to +5.0 kHz for integrated 13Cα regions of (B) 60–61
ppm and (C) 54–55 ppm (experimental, solid; simulated, dashed).
All fitting simulations for the line shapes shown demonstrated order
parameters of S ≥ 0.95. Additional fittings
are provided in Figure S3.

To extend upon these observations and obtain a
quantitative measure
of protein dynamics, we performed 1H–13Cα dipolar coupling measurements for 13Cα
one-dimensional (1D) regions between 50 and 63 ppm using the T-MREV21,22 pulse sequence (Figures 2B,C and S3). The scaled dipolar
couplings (and order parameters) corresponding to 1 ppm wide integrals
of the 13Cα region were determined from fitting simulations
(and normalization to NAV). Across the 13Cα chemical
shift range of 50–63 ppm, the order parameters consistently
demonstrated values of ≥0.95, supporting the presence of an
extensive and highly ordered fibril. Furthermore, the order parameters
for the 13Cα spectral region exhibited no significant
dependence on temperature (for all fitting simulations; see Figure S3). Together, these dipolar coupling
data provide strong support for the extensive rigidity of AL-09 VL fibrils, encompassing the majority of the 108 aa protein
sequence (∼70 residues),14 as well
as a low dependence on temperatures above and below the bulk water
phase-transition temperatures. It is interesting to note that this
rather extensive structured region observed for AL-09 VL fibrils is slightly larger than the sizes of several previously
determined fibril structures, such as amyloid-β (21–40
residues), human prion protein variant huPrP23–144 (∼28
residues), and α-synuclein fibrils (∼56 residues), yet
comparable in size to that observed for PI3-SH3 fibrils (75 residues)
and the long straight fibrils of β2-microglobulin
(64 residues).18,23−27

N- and C-Terminal Residues of AL-09 VL Are Highly
Ordered in the Fibril Structure
As demonstrated above, one
prominent feature of AL-09 VL fibrils is that a large proportion
of the most highly ordered residues is located near the N- and C-termini
of the protein sequence (Figures 1 and S1).14 The 15N–13Cα–13CX three-dimensional (3D) strips in Figure 3A,B demonstrate the high resolution and sensitivity
for a subset of the N- and C-terminal residues, supporting both their
high rigidity and structural order. Furthermore, the observation of
strong and well-resolved side-chain cross-peaks for these residues
provides substantial support for their adoption of a single, ordered
structure in the fibril state, as the existence of many different
conformations would cause side-chain signals arising from multiple
magnetization transfer steps to be much weaker and broader. Additionally,
these residues appear to exhibit a homogeneous conformation because
only a single set of corresponding backbone and side-chain cross-peaks
is observed in each 3D strip (Figure 3). For example, for residue V15, two unique chemical
shifts (22.6 and 20.3 ppm) are observed for the geminal side-chain
methyl carbons (13Cγ1 and 13Cγ2),
indicating that the residue exists in only one conformation (Figure 3A). Collectively,
these observations of well-defined side-chain rotamers in the termini
are particularly interesting in contrast to those in the previous
studies of other fibrils for which the termini are highly dynamic.19,28 Given both the high rigidity and order of the N- and C-terminal
residues, it is very likely that these two regions are the major participants
in maintaining the rigid structural integrity of the fibril state.
These data further suggest that AL-09 VL fibrils demonstrate
a long-range structural order, which may be a unique feature of AL
proteins relative to other reported amyloid fibril structures.29,30

AL-09 VL fibrils, demonstrating the
backbone and side-chain atom assignments for (A) S10–D17 (N-terminal
residues) and (B) L94–T102 (C-terminal residues). The sequential
backbone atom connectivity of these and all other assigned residues
is described previously.14 Data were acquired
at 600 MHz with a MAS rate of 13.333 kHz and dipolar-assisted rotational
resonance (DARR) mixing time of 25 ms.

To quantify the rigidity of the termini at a site-specific
level,
we performed the 3D R48318 version of R-symmetry
sequences31 with supercycled POST-C7 (SPC-7) 13C–13C mixing32 to measure the scaled 1H–13Cα
dipolar couplings of 14 residues in total, located at either the N-
or the C-terminus (resolved in a third dimension via 13Cβ). Specifically, these residues include S7, S12–V15,
V19–I21, and A25 (N-terminus) and A84, T85, L94, P95, and T97
(C-terminus) and were chosen because they exhibited strong 13Cβ–13Cα cross-peaks in the first CC
2D spectral plane (i.e., those above 15 times the noise floor) from
which the dipolar dephasing trajectories could be readily extracted
(Figure 4A). For all
cases, the simulated 1H–13Cα scaling
factors corresponded to order parameters of S ≥
0.95 relative to the residue exhibiting the highest scaling factor,
I21 (Figures 4B,C and S4). Collectively, the large magnitude of these
backbone 13Cα order parameters reveals the extensive
and high rigidity of the residues within both the N- and C-termini.

respectively). Residues for which the 1H–13Cα dipolar coupling line shapes were extracted and simulated

AL-09 VL sequence. The corresponding order parameter, S, for each 13Cα site is indicated next
to the line shape (normalized to the site with the largest measured 1H–13Cα scaling factor). Additional
fitting simulations are shown in Figure S4.

Interestingly, as described previously
on amyloidogenic/AL VL’s, a “cryptic epitope”
is proposed to
occur within the first 18 residues of the N-terminus, in which the
presence of a proline at position 8 in combination with residues 1–4
and 13–18 supports the formation of an aberrant bend within
β-strand A of the native VL.33 This conformational rearrangement of the N-terminus around P8 upon
VL misfolding would be consistent with our observation
of its involvement in the fibril structure, as the CANCO CP efficiency
generally increases in either direction for residues before and after
P8 (Figure S1B). Furthermore, the presence
of a β-bulge in strand G at the C-terminus of VL’s
(residues 97–108) has been implicated in serving as a protective
structural motif that discourages fibril formation,34 with a particularly prominent β-bulge in kappa VL’s over lambda structures.35 It is possible that during fibril formation this motif undergoes
a conformational change that supports an aberrant, yet highly ordered,
conformation. Given that both the N- and C-termini of the AL-09 VL sequence contain an approximately 12 aa stretch of generally
intervening hydrophilic–hydrophobic residues (i.e., S10–T22
and Y96–K107), one entropically favorable rearrangement that
may occur could be through the interaction of these regions via their
hydrophobic side chains. Certainly, understanding the specific orientation
and interactions associated with the N- and C-terminal residues of
AL-09 VL fibrils is fundamental to determining the tertiary
fibril structure and may be pursued in future SSNMR studies by the
measurement of intramolecular distance restraints36,37 in combination with sparsely or selectively 13C-labeled
samples.17,36,38−40

Additional insight into the structure and formation of AL-09
VL fibrils is provided by consideration of the effects
of mutations
on the protein stability. Globular proteins undergo partial unfolding
to initiate misfolding events. This is unlike unstructured peptides
(Aβ peptide) and intrinsically disordered proteins (α-synuclein)
that initiate misfolding events from an unstructured or unfolded state.
Mutations associated with amyloid diseases, in general, decrease the
conformational stability of the globular native fold and promote aggregation
in vitro. These mutations usually influence the thermodynamics of
the process and may not participate in direct interactions within
the fibril structure.41 Our mutational
analyses of AL-09 VL have shown that the nonconservative
mutations located within the dimer interface of the soluble protein
structure destabilize the protein and accelerate amyloid formation.10 As nonconservative mutations in AL proteins
may lower the energy barrier for the initial misfolding events to
occur, we hypothesize that these effects are involved in the case
of AL-09 VL during the amyloid nucleation event. Accordingly,
in combination with our observation of possibly reduced CP signal
intensity and/or resolution for peaks corresponding to mutation sites,
this description suggests that the mutations have critical influence
in the early misfolding event but may not be key contributors to maintaining
the rigid final fibril structure. Such an explanation would be consistent
with the extensive rigidity and order that we report to
primarily be localized in the N- and C-terminal regions of AL-09 VL fibrils.

AL-09 VL Fibrils Prepared in Vitro
Exhibit Structural
Similarities to AL Extracts from Human Tissue
To assess the
physiological relevance of the AL-09 VL fibril samples
studied herein, we investigated the structural similarities to ex
vivo amyloid by comparing the (1H)–13C CP 1D spectrum of AL-09 VL fibrils (U-[15N,13C]-labeled) with that of AL fibril deposits extracted
directly from postmortem human spleen tissue (HIG; natural abundance)
(Figure 5A). These
ex vivo fibrils share the same κI germline gene product with
AL-09 VL, which minimizes the number of amino acid differences
between the two samples (Figure 5B). As illustrated in Figure 5A, the HIG amyloid is well-structured and
exhibits similarities in chemical shift patterns as AL-09 VL fibrils, such as with respect to the downfield Thr- and Ser-13Cβ chemical shifts indicative of predominantly a β-sheet
secondary structure. Furthermore, unique
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) signals are observed near 75 and 183 ppm in
the HIG spectrum (arising from the hydroxyl-containing and carboxylate
carbons of GAGs, respectively), consistent with mass spectrometric
analysis, which revealed the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycan
(HSPG2) in the spleen tissue extract. Together, these results are
in agreement with the known association of GAGs with AL fibrils in
vivo.42,43 Other spectral differences can be accounted
for by variations in the protein sequences of AL-09 VL and
HIG (Figure 5B).

the spleen tissue extract (HIG). (A) Overlay of 13C 1D
SSNMR spectra (normalized to the 13Cα region) for
the 13C natural abundance amyloid extract from postmortem

(B) Sequence alignment for HIG, AL-09, and κI O18/O8 (germline;
gray) VL proteins (residues −1 and 0 are purification
artifacts). Highlighted residues indicate mutation sites; those that
are nonconservative are underlined.

In addition to providing foundational insight into the structural
similarities of the two AL fibrils, these results represent the first
demonstration of the feasibility of studying the molecular structures
of AL fibrils that are pathologically relevant. Moreover, although
the spectral sensitivity of ex vivo fibrils is limited by the lack
of 13C and 15N enrichment, future structural
studies of tissue fibril deposits will be facilitated by using the
fibril material as a seed for in vitro preparations of isotopically
labeled fibril samples. This approach has been shown to be successful
in previous SSNMR studies for Aβ1–40 fibrils
extracted from Alzheimer’s disease-afflicted brain tissue.44 These studies will be further supported by the
ability to immediately assess the physiological relevance and structural
similarity of the labeled fibrils using the (1H)–13C CP 1D spectrum obtained for HIG fibrils here as “fingerprint”
comparison (Figure 5A).

As described earlier, one inherent challenge associated
with the
study of AL disease is the large sequence variation that can occur
among patients, consequently limiting the ability to predict and identify
early on the occurrence of AL sequences with high fibril-forming propensity.
However, interestingly, previous work has identified a murine monoclonal
antibody that can be used to specifically bind AL fibrils (as opposed
to the native soluble species) irrespective of slight sequence variations,
even between germline isotypes, so long as a proline is present at
position 8 of the protein sequence.33,45 These observations
indicate that a unique structural motif forms around P8, previously
proposed to be a β-turn, that binds specifically to the binding
domain of the murine antibody. Given that P8 is 100% conserved among
kappa AL sequences such as AL-09 and HIG (Figure 5B) and that it exhibits structural order
in AL-09 VL fibrils, it is possible that the corresponding
structure of the N-terminal region represents this unique recognition
motif. Although additional structural studies will be necessary to
confirm this, agreement of these two structures would suggest that
all AL fibrils containing this proline-8 would adopt the same structural
motif and possibly other similar aspects of the structural framework
of the fibril. Certainly, knowledge of whether a prevailing structural
conformation or motif exists between different AL fibrils would provide
enormous support for the structure-based design of potential diagnostic
or therapeutic strategies, thus further emphasizing the importance
of future structural studies on pathologically relevant AL fibrils.

Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the secondary
structure and relative
dynamics across the AL-09 VL sequence in its fibril form
using MAS SSNMR spectroscopy and subsequently assessed the structural
similarity of ex vivo AL amyloid obtained from spleen tissue with
in vitro-generated AL-09 VL fibrils used in the present
study. Overall, our data reveal that extensive regions of the AL-09
VL sequence are highly rigid and β-strand-rich in
the fibril state, encompassing the majority of the residues in the
protein. Furthermore, our results indicate that the residues near
the N- and C-termini are especially well-ordered and exhibit only
a single conformation in the fibril form. These measurements of fibril
rigidity and relative order were performed at both the global sample
and site-specific levels. In light of the success of previous work
on the determination of other fibril structures, such as amyloid-β
in Alzheimer’s disease and α-synuclein in Parkinson’s
disease,23,25 the results presented here on AL-09 VL fibrils are very promising with respect to the feasibility
of determining the corresponding 3D structure. Furthermore, the unique
structural features already observed for AL-09 VL fibrils,
including the high degree of order for N- and C-terminus residues,
relative to other fibril structures suggest that AL-09 exhibits a
different and possibly novel type of fold or packing. Moreover, the
serine-rich sequence of AL-09 VL relative to the generally
hydrophobic-rich sequences of other amyloid fibrils46,47 may lead to additional complexities in the fibril structure.

On comparing the 1D 13C spectrum of in vitro prepared
AL-09 VL fibrils with that of ex vivo AL fibrils obtained
from human spleen tissue, we found that both fibrils exhibit a high
degree of rigidity and β-strand content. Importantly, these
data also set the framework on which additional pathologically relevant
AL samples may be studied, including the in vitro preparation of isotopically
labeled AL fibrils by the introduction of a fibril seed from the tissue
extract to propagate the relevant structure. Indeed, given the recent
identification of AL fibrils as the species toxic to cardiomyocytes
in vitro, causing cell growth arrest,5 there
is tremendous value in the delineation of the molecular fibril structure
for benefiting the pursuit of AL therapies that are directed at the
fibril species. Accordingly, we envision that these structural insights
into AL fibrils will inform the ongoing search for effective treatments
and biomarkers of AL disease, including small-molecule inhibitors
of fibril formation as well as monoclonal antibodies specific for
insoluble AL fibrils.4,8,9,33,48

Experimental
Section
Protein Expression and Purification
The uniformly [13C, 15N] labeled AL-09 VL protein (an
AL VL derived from a cardiac AL patient)2 was expressed and purified utilizing a modification of
earlier methods4,49 to accommodate minimal media
with 13C and 15N isotopes, as described.14Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Gold competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were
used to express the AL-09 VL plasmid (pET12a) in 2xYT media
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) and grown until an A600 nm of 0.6. The culture was subsequently transferred
into minimal M9 media50 (with labeled [13C]-glucose and [15N]-ammonium chloride; 3.0 and
1.0 g/L media, respectively) at a 4-fold higher cell concentration
and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before induction with isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.8 mM). The expression
was allowed to persist overnight at 25 °C and 100 rpm prior to
harvesting. Protein purification was performed using osmotic shock
(as described),14 followed by injection
onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 size-exclusion column in a 10 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.4, buffer using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).

AL-09 VL purity
and concentration were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and UV absorption (extinction coefficient, ε
= 13 610 cm–1 M–1), respectively.
Far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to verify native protein
folding prior to the fibril formation reaction, acquiring from 200
to 260 nm at 4 °C with Jasco spectropolarimeter 810 (JASCO, Inc.,
Easton, MD) and a 0.2 cm path-length quartz cuvette. Percent [13C, 15N]-isotope incorporation in purified AL-09
VL was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time
of flight to be approximately 99%.

In Vitro Fibril Formation
Uniformly [13C, 15N]-labeled AL-09 VL fibril samples were prepared
from purified protein monomers as described.14,51 The AL-09 VL monomer was separated from any preformed
aggregates by filtering the purified product through a 0.45 μm
membrane and subjecting the filtrate to ultracentrifugation (90 000
rpm, 3.3 h) at 4 °C using an NVT-90 rotor and Optima L-100 XP
centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Fibril-forming samples were
subsequently prepared on ice from the monomer-containing supernatant
at 20 μM in the acetate borate citrate buffer (10 mM each, pH
2.0), containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3 in 1.5 mL low-binding
microcentrifuge tubes (1.0 mL total volume). An additional sample
was prepared for each replicate under the same conditions but with
10 μM thioflavin T (ThT) added for monitoring fibrillation progress.
Fibril formation reactions were performed in triplicate in sealed
(Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), black 96-well polystyrene plates (Greiner,
Monroe, NC) at 37 °C and 300 rpm (in a New Brunswick Scientific
Innova40 incubator shaker), using 260 μL aliquots per well until
fibril formation was complete, based on the change in the enhanced
fluorescence intensity of ThT. The presence of fibrils was subsequently
confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, according to previous
protocols.14 The average time for the AL-09
VL fibril formation was approximately 2 days.

Preparation
of Fibrils for SSNMR Studies
As previously
described,14 completed fibril reaction
mixtures were subjected to ultracentrifugation in polypropylene microfuge
tubes using a table-top ultracentrifuge with a TLA-100.3 (Beckman
Coulter) rotor and microfuge tube adapters for 1 h at 4 °C and
55 000 rpm (∼100 000g). The
pelleted fibril material was separated from the supernatant and washed
twice with deionized water using a hand homogenizer and repeated ultracentrifugation.
Washed fibril pellets were dried completely under nitrogen gas until
the sample mass remained unchanged. Dried AL-09 VL fibril
samples were packed into either a 3.2 mm (outer diameter) standard-wall
or thin-wall SSNMR MAS rotor (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA)
and hydrated to a level of 50% water by mass. Hydration of packed
samples was retained using Kel-F and rubber spacers on both ends of
the sample in the rotor.

AL Amyloid Extraction
Patient HIG
was a male Caucasian
diagnosed with multiple myeloma and subsequently hepatosplenic ALκ
amyloidosis. The AL component comprising the amyloid fibrils was shown
by aa sequencing to be a κI protein expressed by the O18–O8
(IGKV-1-33) germline gene with a glycosylation site introduced at
N30–N31–S32.

Water-soluble amyloid extracts were
prepared following prior protocols with some modifications.45,52 In short, 30–40 g of freshly frozen (−80 °C)
spleen obtained postmortem from patient HIG was homogenized in about
300 mL prechilled saline solution (Virtis-Tempest; Virtis, Gardiner,
NY). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 6 °C
and 15 000g, and the residual saline-soluble
material was removed by repeated cycles of homogenization and washing
until the optical density (at 280 nm) of the supernatant was less
than 0.10. The pellet was then subjected to repeated rounds of homogenization,
washing (cold, deionized water), and centrifugation; collecting and
lyophilizing the amyloid-containing supernatant after each successive
round. The amount of protein recovered represented ∼25% the
weight of the starting material. Approximately 10 mg of the lyophilized
material was rehydrated to ∼50% water by mass and packed into
a 3.2 mm standard-wall SSNMR rotor (Agilent Technologies).

SSNMR
Spectroscopy
MAS SSNMR data of [13C, 15N]-labeled AL-09 VL were collected on
the following spectrometers: a 600 MHz InfinityPlus wide-bore or narrow-bore
spectrometer equipped with a 3.2 mm Balun 1H–13C–15N or T3 1H–13C–31P probe, respectively; a 500 MHz VNMRS (Varian,
Walnut Creek, CA) spectrometer equipped with a 3.2 mm Balun 1H–13C–15N probe; and a 750 MHz
VNMRS spectrometer equipped with a 3.2 mm Balun or BioMAS 1H–13C–15N probe (Varian, Fort
Collins, CO). Multidimensional 15N and 13C correlation
experiments were performed using MAS rates of 11.111 kHz (500 MHz
spectrometer), 13.333 kHz (600 MHz), and 12.500 kHz (750 MHz) and
variable-temperature (VT) stack air flow set points of −10,
0, and 10 °C (for sample temperatures
of −5, 4, and 12 °C ± 3 °C, respectively, as
determined by calibration with ethylene glycol).53 A SPINAL-64 1H-decoupling power of 65–80
kHz was applied during evolution and acquisition periods.54 One-bond 13C–13C correlations were achieved using either DARR (τmix = 25–90 ms)55 or SPC-7 (τmix = 0.9–1.8 ms)32 for magnetization
transfer, and one-bond 15N–13C or 13C–15N correlations were accomplished using
SPECIFIC-CP.56 Additional experimental
details for multidimensional data acquisition (e.g., digitization
settings and specific radio-frequency powers) were summarized previously.14

Temperature-dependent 15N–13Cα (NCA) 2D experiments were performed at −30,
−10, and 20 °C (VT set points, corresponding to sample
temperatures of −23, −5, and 21 ± 3 °C, respectively),
using a MAS rate of 13.333 kHz (600 MHz) and SPINAL-64 1H-decoupling power13 of 72 kHz. Short
CP contact times of 0.1 and 2.0 ms were used for 1H–15N and 15N–13Cα transfers,
respectively, to promote only intraresidue magnetization transfer
(relative to other 1H–15N–13C correlation experiments, which used contact times of 1.5
and 5.0
ms, respectively). T-MREV 1H–13C dipolar
recoupling experiments22 were performed
at the same three temperatures (VT) but using a MAS rate of 7.576
kHz (600 MHz) and two-pulse phase modulation 1H-decoupling
power18 of 72 kHz. Scaling factors for 1H–13C dipolar couplings of AL-09 VL fibrils were normalized
to the 1H–13Cα scaling factor measured
for crystalline [13C, 15N]-labeled N-acetyl-valine. R48318-symmetry 1H–13C–13C–1H 3D dipolar recoupling experiments were performed using a MAS rate
of 13.333 kHz (600 MHz) and VT set point of 20 °C, with a SPINAL-64 1H-decoupling power of 74 kHz. MAS SSNMR data for the spleen
tissue AL extract sample (HIG) were collected on the 600 MHz narrow-bore
spectrometer using a MAS rate of 10.000 kHz, a VT set point of 10
°C, and a SPINAL-64 1H-decoupling power of 65 kHz.
The (1H)–13C CP 1D spectrum represents
a total of 61.5 h of data collection time (108 544 scans).

SSNMR Data Processing and Analysis
SSNMR data were
processed using NMRPipe.57 Multidimensional 15N and/or 13C correlation spectra were analyzed
using Sparky,58 and chemical shift-based
predictions on protein secondary structure were performed using TALOS-N15 as well as by comparing with the random
coil chemical shift values presented by Zhang et al.16 T-MREV and R48318-symmetry 1H–13C dipolar coupling dephasing curves were analyzed
using an in-house fitting program (written in FORTRAN).22 The zero-frequency intensity present in R-symmetry
spectra was excluded from the fitting simulations.59
