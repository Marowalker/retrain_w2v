The
synthesis of pyrrolyl 4-quinolinone alkaloid, quinolactacide,
and its analogues was successfully achieved using 9-azajulolidine
(9-AJ)-catalyzed tandem acyl transfer–regioselective cyclization
of N,N-diacyl-o-alkynoylaniline derivatives. In addition, this organocatalytic reaction
was successfully utilized for the synthesis of a variety of 3-acyl-4-quinolinones
in moderate-to-good yields. Mechanistic studies, including a time
course nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment, indicated that
the 1,4-addition of 9-AJ to an ynone system can be considered to be
the rate-determining step in this quinolinone synthesis.

Introduction
Quinolinones are known
to be one of the privileged structures in
the recent drug discovery; in particular, 4-quinolinone derivatives
exhibit unique and valuable biological properties such as antimalarial,
antifungal, and antitumor activities.1 As
such, they are promising drug candidates; for instance, ciprofloxacin
(Ciproxan) and levofloxacin (Cravit) are widely utilized as antibacterial
drugs. Because of the importance of quinolinone scaffolds in recent
drug developments, the expansion of the chemical space based on 4-quinolinone
skeletons may assist in further discoveries of novel antibacterial
drugs. In 2005, an unusual pyrrolyl 4-quinolinone alkaloid, quinolactacide
(1), was isolated from Penicillium citrinum F 1539 (Figure 1).2 Additionally, the related analogue penicinoline
(2) was isolated from a mangrove endophytic fungus Penicillium sp.3 The above-mentioned
natural products possess unique structural features; for instance,
they have an unusual pyrrole ring attached at the C-2 position and
a carbonyl moiety at the C-3 position on the 4-quinolinone skeleton.
In particular, 1 possesses a unique γ-lactam ring
system that is produced by the lactamization of 2. Quinolactacide
(1) has been found to exhibit a potent insecticidal activity
against the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) at 250 parts per million (ppm), whereas penicinoline (2) has shown potent cytotoxicity against 95-D and HepG2 cell lines
with IC50 values of 0.57 and 6.5 μg/mL, respectively.
On the other hand, the decarboxylated derivative of 2 was not found to exhibit any biological properties, which suggests
that the carbonyl moiety at the C-3 position is crucial for 2 to exhibit its biological activities.4

(2).

A synthetic method for
developing 3-acyl- or 3-alkoxycarbonyl-4-quinolinone
derivatives would be highly useful for the research and development
of new antibacterial drugs. For example, several reactions, such as
the Gould–Jacobs reaction,5 the
Grohe–Heitzer reaction,6 and the
palladium-catalyzed heterocycle formations,7 are often used to synthesize quinolinone derivatives; however, harsh
conditions are required to prepare 4-quinolinones. Recently, we have
reported a concise and regioselective synthesis of 3-acylflavones
through a Lewis base catalyzed tandem acyl transfer–cyclization
of o-alkynoylphenol derivatives, and this method
successfully provides a chromone skeleton comprising an aryl group
at the C-2 position and an acyl moiety at the C-3 position (Figure 2).8 As 4-quinolinone skeletons possess a ring system similar
to those of flavone derivatives, we assumed that specific 3-acyl-4-quinolinone
skeletons can be readily prepared under ambient conditions from o-alkynoylaniline derivatives using Lewis base catalyzed
reactions similar to the synthesis of 3-acylflavones. Herein, we report
on the facile synthesis of quinolactacide (1) and its
analogues via 9-azajulolidine (9-AJ)-catalyzed tandem acyl transfer–cyclization
of N,N-diacyl-o-alkynoylanilines.

Figure 2 Synthetic plan for 3-acyl-4-quinolinone derivatives.

The retrosynthesis of quinolactacide
(1) and its analogues
is illustrated in Scheme 1. Quinolactacide (1) can be obtained from a common
intermediate methyl penicinoline (3) through lactamization
under basic conditions. The key intermediate 3 can be
readily prepared in one pot via the Lewis base catalyzed tandem acyl
transfer–cyclization of o-alkynoylaniline
derivative 4 that is protected by tert-butoxycarbonyl and methoxycarbonyl groups. To synthesize the key
intermediate 4 in a chemo- and regioselective manner,
the methoxycarbonyl group on 4 should be selectively
transferred to the C-3 position on the 4-quinolinone skeleton rather
than the bulky tert-butoxycarbonyl group. In 2006,
the synthesis of quinolactacide (1) was reported by Abe
et al., wherein they successfully synthesized 1 from l-proline by utilizing the MnO2-mediated dehydrative
aromatization of the pyrrolidine ring.9 However, harsh oxidative conditions are required to construct the
pyrrole ring at the later stage of this synthesis; this meant that
the introduction of functional groups on the pyrrole ring would be
limited. We assume that our convergent approach would be effective
for synthesizing various analogues of quinolactacide (1).

Results and Discussion
To begin with, we investigated the reaction conditions for the
synthesis of the 3-acyl-4-quinolinone skeleton using N-Boc-N-benzoylalkynoylaniline 5a as
the substrate. Substrates 5 were prepared from N-Boc-2-iodoaniline (6)10 using N-acylation and carbonylative Sonogashira
coupling with phenylacetylene, as shown in Scheme 2. The reaction of 5a proceeded
in the presence of 30 mol % 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) to provide
3-benzoyl-4-quinolinone 8a in 66% yield (Table 1, entry 1). The structure of 8a was unambiguously confirmed using X-ray crystallographic
analysis (X-ray crystal structure deposition number: CCDC 1542139),
which indicated that a smaller benzoyl group was selectively transferred
to the C-3 position on the quinolinone skeleton under the reaction
conditions (Figure 3). To improve the yield of 8a, we conducted further
investigations with a number of Lewis base catalysts: 4-Pyrrolidinopyridine
(PPY)11 was found to be ineffective for
inducing either an acyl transfer or a 6-endo cyclization (55% yield,
entry 2). Interestingly, 9-AJ12 efficiently
promoted the reaction leading to 8a in 84% yield (entry
3). On the other hand, a decrease in the yield of 8a was
observed on either performing the reaction at 50 °C or reducing
the amount of 9-AJ (entries 4 and 5). In addition, the reaction in
a less polar or nonpolar solvent gave poor results; the use of MeCN
as a solvent significantly decreased the yield of 8a (50%,
entry 6); and substrate 7a was not completely consumed
in 48 h, when the reaction was performed in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
or toluene (entries 7 and 8). It is noteworthy that the use of dimethylformamide
(DMF) as a solvent is crucial to provide 8a in the desirable
yield. We also investigated the Lewis bases for the reaction; however,
sufficient amounts of 8a were not produced in the presence
of other Lewis bases such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO),
PPh3, PCy3, and PBu3 (entries 9–12);
substrate 5a, in particular, was completely recovered
due to the low nucleophilicity of DABCO and PPh3 to the
substrate under these conditions. In contrast to DABCO and PPh3, trialkylphosphines, such as PCy3 and PBu3, showed enough nucleophilicity to promote the reaction at
ambient temperature; however, it was observed that hardly any quinolinone 8a was obtained, and instead, 5-exo-cyclized indolinone 10 was isolated in 5% yield from the resulting mixture (entry
12). We assumed that a less-hindered amide bond might be cleaved by
the nucleophilic PBu3 to provide anilide 9, which would subsequently be converted to the corresponding indolinone
derivative 10 by 5-exo cyclization,13 as shown in Scheme 3.14

c 10 was isolated (5%).

Following the above-mentioned process, we investigated the scope
of the substrate in the 9-AJ-catalyzed reaction. The results are summarized
in Table 2. The reactions
of substrate 5b possessing a methoxycarbonyl group and 5c having an ethoxycarbonyl group were completed in 21 h at
ambient temperature to afford the desired 8b and 8c in moderate-to-excellent yields (entries 1 and 2). However,
the bulkiness of the R group significantly diminished the yield of
the corresponding 4-quinolinone derivatives; the tandem acyl transfer–cyclization
of 5d (R = isopropoxy) slowly proceeded, leading to the
corresponding 8d in 44% yield (entry 3). Notably, the
reaction of substrate 5e, which comprised bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl) groups, led to a complex mixture when
the reaction was conducted at 80 °C (entry 4). In contrast to
substrate 5a consisting of a phenyl group as the R moiety,
the reaction of 5f was completed within 3 h because the
electrophilicity of the acyl group increased due to the electron-withdrawing
para-chloride atom on the phenyl ring, and the corresponding 8f was afforded in 84% yield (entry 5). On the other hand,
substrate 5g was slowly consumed because of an electron-donating
para-methoxy group leading to 8g in 81% yield (entry
6). In addition, the reaction of 5i with a meta-methoxy
group was complete in 13 h to afford 8i in 79% yield
(entry 8), whereas substrate 5h possessing a meta-chloride
atom was smoothly converted into the corresponding 8h (entry 7). The above-mentioned observation indicated that a para-substituent
on the phenyl ring affected the reactivity in the rearrangement of
the acyl group to the C-3 position, which was consistent with the
results previously reported for the synthesis of 3-acylflavones.8 Next, we investigated the reaction of alkanamide
derivatives. Low yields of 3-acyl-4-quinolinones 8j and 8k were observed when the substrates possessing an acetyl
and a 2-methylpropanoyl group were used (entries 9 and 10). On the
other hand, substrate 5l possessing a pivaloyl group
was successfully
converted to the corresponding 8l in a moderate yield
(entry 11), indicating that the presence of an acidic α-proton
in the acyl moiety, such as in the acetyl and 2-methylpropanoyl groups,
would be problematic to give the desired 3-acyl-4-quinolinones in
the acceptable yield. In addition, substrate 11 possessing
a methyl group instead of the Boc group on the nitrogen was also subjected
to the reaction conditions mentioned above; however, the reaction
did not proceed at all to provide product 12 (Scheme 4). This is likely
because the N-alkylamide bond was less cleavable
than the electron-deficient N-Boc amide because of
an electron-donating alkyl group, which indicated that an N,N-diacyl moiety is necessary to induce
the acyl transfer leading to the desired 3-acyl-4-quinolinone skeleton.

We next attempted
to isolate a reaction intermediate using substrate 5m containing bis-Boc groups on the nitrogen atom to elucidate
the reaction mechanism (Scheme 5). No intermediate was observed by the thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) analysis in the presence of a slightly excess amount of 9-AJ;
however, the addition of 1 equiv of Brønsted acid smoothly converted
substrate 5m to an E/Z mixture of 9-AJ adducts. The E-isomer of 9-AJ adduct 13m was partially separated by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), and the structural assignment of the E-isomer
was conducted by nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY),
as shown in Scheme 5. In addition, the time course of the 9-AJ-catalyzed reaction of
substrate 5b was monitored using proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy in DMF-d7 at 30 °C (Figure 4). Substrate 5b was found to be gradually
consumed, and the substrate was completely converted to the corresponding
quinolinone 8b in 21 h. Interestingly, a presumable intermediate,
such as allenolate 14b or enone 15b, was
not observed, and the chemical shifts of 9-AJ did not change during
the time course experiment in DMF-d7;
this indicates that an acyl transfer to the C-3 position and the 6-endo
cyclization of the resulting enone 15b would subsequently
occur at ambient temperature after the formation of allenolate 14b.

Adduct 13m
We also noticed that the addition of Brønsted acid
induced
1,4-addition of 9-AJ to the ynone system, indicating that the activation
of the carbonyl moiety in the ynone system would be crucial to promote
this reaction. In addition, we assumed that an acyl group on the nitrogen
atom could act as an activator of the carbonyl moiety in the ynone
system, as shown in Figure 5. In fact, the reaction of 5f possessing an electron-withdrawing
acyl group quickly afforded 8f (Table 2, entry 5), whereas substrate 5g was slowly converted into 8g (entry 6). This can be
because the increase in the electrophilicity
of the acyl group may prove conducive for the activation of the carbonyl
moiety in the ynone system, leading to intermediate 16, which shows that 1,4-addition of 9-AJ was smoothly induced to promote
the following reactions such as the acyl transfer to the C-3 position
and 6-endo cyclization.

Figure 5 Plausible activation of the carbonyl moiety
in the ynone system.

On the basis of the extensive consideration of the reaction
mechanism,
the plausible mechanism of the 9-AJ-catalyzed reaction can be explained
as follows: 1,4-addition of 9-AJ to substrate 5 occurs
and the nucleophilic attack of the resulting anion to the less-hindered
acyl group would subsequently occur to provide intermediate 16, which can reversibly be converted into two potential structures:
anilide 17 (path a) and allenolate 14 (path
b). As the anilide moiety in 17 does not undergo 5-exo
cyclization when using 9-AJ as the catalyst, 17 would
transform allenolate 14 through intermediate 16. The less-hindered acyl group in 14 can then be irreversibly
transferred to the C-3 position, leading to enone 15.
The resulting enone 15 is a good Michael acceptor; therefore,
6-endo cyclization readily occurs, and the following elimination of
9-AJ exclusively provides 3-acyl-4-quinolinone derivative 8 (Figure 6). Because
no intermediate was observed in the time course NMR experiment, as
illustrated in Figure 4, we assumed that the 1,4-addition of 9-AJ to substrate 5 was the rate-determining step in this quinolinone synthesis.

Figure 6 Plausible reaction
mechanism for the 9-AJ-catalyzed tandem acyl
transfer–cyclization of o-alkynoylaniline 5 leading to 3-acyl-4-quinolinone 8.

We then applied this method to the total synthesis
of quinolactacide
(1) and its analogues using the 9-AJ-catalyzed reaction,
and the details of the synthesis are illustrated in Scheme 6. Sonogashira coupling of N-Boc-2-bromopyrrole (18)15 with trimethylsilyl (TMS) acetylene, followed by the removal
of the TMS group, provided alkyne 19 in 88% yield. The
resulting derivative 19 was then subjected to Pd(0)-catalyzed
carbonylative Sonogashira coupling with iodoaniline derivative 7b in the presence of CuI under 50 atm of carbon monoxide
at 80 °C to afford the desired o-alkynoylaniline
derivative 4 in 64% yield. 9-AJ (30 mol %) was found
to efficiently promote the tandem acyl transfer–cyclization
of 4 at 80 °C, whereas the reaction did not proceed
at room temperature because of an electron-rich pyrrole group. We
also observed the partial removal of the Boc group during the formation
of the 3-acyl-4-quinolinone skeleton; therefore, the remaining Boc
group was subsequently removed under acidic conditions, which led
to the production of methyl penicinoline (3)16 in 54% yield. As a final step, the lactamization
of 3 utilizing 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)
furnished quinolactacide (1), which underwent N-methylation,
leading to penicinotam (20) in 95% yield (Scheme 6). The spectral data for the
synthetic quinolactacide (1) and the related analogues
were in good agreement with those of the natural products and the
synthetic compound.1,2

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Quinolactacide
(1) and Penicinotam (20)
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a concise
synthesis of 3-acyl-4-quinolinones
via the Lewis base catalyzed tandem acyl transfer–cyclization
of N,N-diacyl-o-alkynoylanilines 5 and have applied it to the synthesis
of unusual pyrrolyl 4-quinolinone alkaloids. 9-AJ (30 mol %) was found
to efficiently promote the reaction at ambient temperature, and the
corresponding 3-acyl-4-quinolinones 8 were produced in
moderate-to-good yields. Notably, a less-hindered acyl group on the
nitrogen atom was selectively transferred to the C-3 position on the
quinolinone skeleton. A time course experiment of substrate 5b using 1H NMR was conducted, and we found that
no intermediate was observed during this experiment. On the other
hand, 9-AJ adduct 13m was successfully obtained by treatment
with an excess amount of 9-AJ, followed by the addition of 1 equiv
of Brønsted acid. Therefore, we speculated that 1,4-addition
of 9-AJ to the ynone system is the rate-determining step for this
reaction. In addition, this method was applied to the synthesis of
pyrrolyl 4-quinolinone alkaloid quinolactacide (1) and
related analogues. o-Alkynoylaniline derivative 4 was readily consumed in the presence of 30 mol % 9-AJ at
80 °C, and the subsequent removal of the Boc group under acidic
conditions afforded methyl penicinoline (3) in 54% yield.
The syntheses of quinolactacide (1) and penicinotam (20) were readily achieved from intermediate 3 by lactamization and N-methylation under basic conditions. Notably,
the Lewis base catalyzed tandem acyl transfer–cyclization we
developed can be applied to the synthesis of functionalized benzoheterocycles.
We will report on the synthesis of benzocarbocycle natural products
using this methodology in due course.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of o-Alkynoylaniline
Derivatives 5 from N,N-Diacyl-2-iodoaniline 7
In a 50 mL autoclave containing a glass tube were
placed N,N-diacyl-2-iodoaniline 7 (1.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv), phenylacetylene derivative (1.2
mmol, 1.20 equiv), triethylamine (3.00 mmol 3.00 equiv), DMF (6.0
mL, 6.00 mL/mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (0.01 mmol, 0.0100
equiv), and CuI (0.02 mmol, 0.0200 equiv). The autoclave was filled
with carbon monoxide (50 atm) after being purged with carbon monoxide
three times. The reaction was carried out under an appropriate carbon
monoxide pressure at 80 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was
diluted with water. The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous
layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers
were washed with saturated aqueous NH4Cl and brine, dried
over MgSO4, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated
in vacuo, and then the resulting residue was purified by column chromatography
on silica gel (eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate = 15/1 to 7/1) to
afford o-alkynoylaniline derivative 5.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3-Acyl-4-quinolinone
Derivatives 8
To a solution of o-alkynoylaniline 7 (0.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in dry DMF (2 mL, 20.0 mL/mmol) was
added 9-AJ (0.03 mmol, 0.300 equiv) at room temperature under argon.
After being stirred at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted
with water at room temperature. The organic layer was separated, and
the aqueous layer was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The combined
organic layers were washed with 1 M aqueous HCl, saturated aqueous
NaHCO3, and brine; dried over MgSO4; and filtered.
The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, and then the resulting residue
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford 3-acyl-4-quinolinone
derivative 8.

crude TMS acetylene derivative in dry THF (25.2 mL, 3.00 mL/mmol)
was added tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 1.00 M in THF solution,
10.1 mL, 1.20 equiv) dropwise at 0 °C under argon. After being
stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h, the reaction mixture was quenched
with 1 M aqueous HCl at 0 °C. The organic layer was separated,
and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined
organic layers were washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine, dried over MgSO4, and filtered. The filtrate
was concentrated in vacuo, and then the resulting residue was purified
by column chromatography on silica gel (eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate
= 100/1) to afford 2-ethynylpyrrole 19 (1.42 g, 7.42
