Drought is a major
abiotic stress affecting crop growth and yield
worldwide. Drought-induced oxidative stress results in the reduction
of plant photosynthesis and reproductive success. Cerium oxide nanoparticles
(nanoceria) possess potent antioxidant properties that can alleviate
drought-induced oxidative stress by catalytic scavenging reactive
oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting sorghum [Sorghum
bicolor (L.) Moench] photosynthesis and grain yield. Drought was imposed at the booting
stage by withholding water for 21 d. Foliar-sprayed nanoceria (10
mg L–1) efficiently reduced leaf superoxide radical
(41%) and hydrogen peroxide (36%) levels and decreased cell membrane
lipid peroxidation (37%) under drought. Nanoceria increased leaf carbon
assimilation rates (38%), pollen germination (31%), and seed yield
per plant (31%) in drought-stressed plants relative to water-sprayed
controls. Translocation study indicated that nanoceria can move from
root to shoot of sorghum plants. Toxicity assays in mammalian cells
indicated that nanoceria effective concentration (EC)50 of >250 mg L–1 is well above the concentration
used in this study. Foliar-sprayed nanoceria protect sorghum plants
from oxidative damage under drought stress leading to higher grain
yield.

1 Introduction
Nanotechnology
is a transdisciplinary cutting-edge tool with large
potential in agricultural science to improve crop productivity. Metallic
nanoparticles of varying size, concentration, and surface charge have
been reported to influence the growth and development in diverse plant
species.1 Cerium is a rare earth metal
that exists as either free metal or oxide form and can cycle between
the cerous (Ce3+) and ceric (Ce4+) oxidation
states acting as oxygen buffer.2,3 Cerium oxide forms oxygen
vacancies or defects in the lattice structure by loss of oxygen and/or
its electrons.2,3 The valence and structure of cerium
oxide are dynamic and change spontaneously.4 Nanoceria have chemical and physical properties similar to bulk
cerium but has an exceptional catalytic property because of its increased
surface area and oxygen vacancies.5 The
ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ sites on the surface of nanoceria
is strongly correlated with its antioxidant–enzyme-mimetic
activity.6,7 Pulido-Reyes et al.8 showed that nanoceria with low Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio
exhibit catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic activity
and scavenge H2O2 and superoxide radical. To
our knowledge, the role of nanoceria in alleviating drought-induced
oxidative damage has not been studied.

Drought is an important
abiotic stress that limits the productivity
of major food crops across the globe. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change has predicted that arid and semiarid regions of
the world where sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is grown
for food and nutritional security will experience a substantial change
in the frequency and intensity of precipitation along with prolonged
periods of water stress and high temperatures.9 Sorghum grain yield is severely decreased by drought.10,11 Simulation models have predicted that mean sorghum yields will decrease
in the next decades by 27% in Australia,12 3–16% in India,13 7–47%
in sub-Saharan Africa,14 and 11–17%
in Mali15 because of drought. It is therefore
critical to develop novel agricultural technologies for protecting
and increasing sorghum grain yield under drought. In arid and semiarid
regions, plants experience drought because of limited water availability
and increased water loss from soil through evaporation and transpiration.16,17 Although a primary physiological effect of drought was decreased
stomatal conductance,18 both stomatal and
nonstomatal limitations are reported to be responsible for decreased
photosynthetic rate under drought.19−21 The relative effects
of stomatal and nonstomatal limitations on photosynthetic rates are
species-dependent,21 and plant responses
to drought within the species are also genotype-specific.22 A main cause for decreased photosynthetic rate
in plants including sorghum is the reduction of CO2 movement
from atmosphere to the sites of carbon assimilation in the chloroplasts17,23−26 because of stomatal closure, leading to enhancement in the production
of reactive oxygen species [ROS, viz., superoxide radical (O2•–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH•), singlet oxygen
(1O2), etc.,] in chloroplasts.27,28 ROS can directly attack DNA,29,30 proteins,29,30 and lipid membranes, leading to oxidative damage.31,32 Herein, we postulate that the nanoceria catalytic ROS scavenging
ability has the potential to reduce ROS levels and alleviates the
detrimental effects of oxidative stress under drought.

To counteract
the damaging effects of ROS accumulation under stress,
plants rely on antioxidative defense systems either through enzymatic
or nonenzymatic pathways. ROS scavenging enzymes including SOD, CAT,
and peroxidases (POXs) and antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, tocopherols,
glutathione, proline, carotenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids
that are involved in detoxification of ROS.29 Under normal conditions, the homeostasis between ROS and antioxidative
enzyme activity is maintained; however, under drought, this balance
is disrupted because of the elevated levels of ROS, leading to oxidative
burst and decreased antioxidants.33 We
hypothesized that nanoceria long-term catalytic scavenging of ROS
protects photosynthetic rates and grain yield of sorghum under drought
conditions. The main objectives of this study were to quantify the
impact of nanoceria on (i) leaf ROS levels and antioxidant enzyme
activity, (ii) pollen germination and seed yield, and (iii) leaf carbon
assimilation rates, stomatal conductance, and leaf anatomical traits
of grain sorghum plants grown under drought stress.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Nanoceria Characterization
The size
and morphology of nanoceria were measured by atomic force microscope
(AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The
AFM images indicate that the synthesized nanoceria have an average
diameter of 15 ± 5 nm (Figure 1a). The TEM images show that the synthesized nanoceria
are rod-shaped (Figure 1b) and the detailed morphological and structural analysis of nanoceria
using a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) revealed a strong presence of
{111} facets (Figure 1c,d). The nanoceria were well crystallized with distinctive set of
fringes unambiguously identified as the (111) plane of cerium oxide
(CeO2), implying that the nanoparticles were predominantly
exposed to the (111) plane and the corresponding interplanar spacing
was 0.31 nm (Figure 1d). The selected-area diffraction pattern of nanoceria (Figure 1e) and crystallites
could be indexed to (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflection planes
of the cubic structure. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
spectra of the synthesized nanoceria confirm the presence of Ce and
O elements with no impurities (insert Figure 1e). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed
the crystalline nature of nanoceria. The diffraction peaks due to
(111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of nanoceria at 2θ of
28.6°, 32.8°, 47.8°, and 56.7°, respectively,
were consistent with the cubic structure of the CeO2 nanoparticle
(JCPDS 89-8436; Figure 1f). The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy spectrum
of nanoceria shows four intense absorption bands at 3341, 1634, 1327,
and 582 cm–1 (Figure 1g). The absorption band at ∼3341 cm–1 was attributed to the O–H mode, and the band at ∼1634
cm–1 corresponds to the bending of H–O–H
which partly overlapped with the O–C–O stretching band.34,35 The band at ∼1327 and 582 cm–1 was associated
with C–H bending and stretching frequency of Ce–O, respectively.36 By considering the relative intensity of the
Ce–O modes to the adsorbed OH compounds, it was clear that
the synthesized nanoceria had high crystallinity and purity. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) curve of nanoceria (Figure 1h) showed two distinct peaks at 125 and 338
°C. The weight loss from 100 to 200 °C was attributed to
the loss of moisture and decomposition of the organic ligands. The
second mass loss at 338 °C was ascribed to the burning of the
residual organic contents. After 400 °C, no change in weight
was observed, indicating the pure phase of CeO2.37

2.2 Impact
of Nanoceria on Mammalian Cell Viability
The Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
recommends to analyze the safety of nanomaterials before their application
to crops. To assess the potential toxicity effects of nanoceria on
mammalian cells, we performed cell viability tests in murine cells
exposed to different levels of nanoceria concentrations. The murine
cell viability of control (0 mg L–1) was considered
as 100%, and the medium supplemented with nanoceria at concentrations
of 100, 250, and 500 mg L–1 showed 25, 28, and 43%
reduction in cell viability, respectively, over control (Figure 2a). The 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) assay is widely used to differentiate normal and apoptotic
cells through staining of nucleus and condensed chromosome (Figure 2b–e). The
results indicated that controls (0 mg L–1) that
exhibit uniform staining of the nucleus with clear nuclear membranes
were observed (Figure 2b). Similar results were observed at 100 and 250 mg L–1 concentrations (Figure 2c,d). However, at 500 mg L–1, abnormal nuclear
margins and nucleus staining were observed (Figure 2e). This indicates that nanoceria at concentrations
of 100 and 250 mg L–1 did not damage most (<28%)
of the fibroblast L929 cells. The results were corroborated with an
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay (Figure 2a).
Previous studies have also shown that LD50 for nanoceria
on various cell lines is more than 100 mg of nanoceria L–1.38−40

2.3 Uptake
of Nanoceria in Plants
Figure 3 shows cerium concentrations
in shoot and root of the sorghum plant grown in acid-washed sand spiked
with 50 and 100 mg L–1. The control leaf and root
samples had a cerium concentration of <0.05 mg kg–1. The cerium concentration in roots was significantly (P ≤ 0.001) higher than shoots at both 50 (1.5-fold) and 100
(2.5-fold) mg L–1 nanoceria concentration. Positive
surface-charged nanoparticle-like CeO2 can accumulates
on the root surface because of the presence of mucilage on the root
surface, leading to reduced mobility from root to shoot.41 Apart from this, the shape of nanoceria also
influences the translocation efficiency, for example, the translocation
of rod-shaped nanoceria was more efficient than octahedral- or cubic-shaped
nanoceria.42 However, translocation of
nanoceria from root to shoots is strongly associated with the transformation
of CeO2 within the cell.43 Biotransformation
studies have indicated that cerium applied as foliar or soil remained
as a nanoparticulate form in plant tissues of maize (Zea mays L.),44 soybean
(Glycine max L. Merr.),45 water melon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb.),46 cucumber (Cucumis
sativus L.),47 and pumpkin
(Cucurbita maxima L.).48 However, the presence of biogenic reductants such as phenols,
reducing sugars, and organic acids in plant cell may potentially convert
the nanoparticulate form to ionic form.49,50

mean ± SE of five independent measurements. Means with different
letters are significantly different at P ≤
0.05.

2.4 Nanoceria
Effect on ROS, Lipid Peroxidation,
and Antioxidant Enzyme Activity
Under drought conditions,
nanoceria-sprayed plants exhibit significant (P ≤
0.01) reductions in contents of O2– (41%, Figure 4a), H2O2 (36%, Figure 4b), and malondialdehyde (MDA, a metric of lipid peroxidation)
(37%, Figure 4c) and
increased activities of SOD (94%, Figure 4d), CAT (117%, Figure 4e), and POX (54%, Figure 4f) compared to water-sprayed control plants
(Figure 4a–f).
Under irrigated conditions, there were no significant differences
in these parameters between water and nanoceria foliar-sprayed treatments
(Figure 4a–f).
Levels of ROS produced in the chloroplast electron transport chain
are kept under control in nonstress conditions by antioxidants and
antioxidant enzyme activity.51 However,
drought increases the production and accumulation of O2– and H2O232 and decreases the antioxidant enzyme activity.52 ROS accumulation that cannot be regulated by
the antioxidant defense system results in oxidation of biomolecules
including nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids.29−32 Nanoceria mimic SOD activity
with a higher efficiency in converting O2– to H2O2 than SOD.5 Large surface area of nanoceria relative to its volume alternates
between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states with
a redox capacity comparable to that of oxygen53 leading to redox reactions54 that scavenge
the ROS produced under drought. Previous studies have demonstrated
the ROS scavenging ability of bare and surface-modified nanoceria
in plants, cell culture, and animal models by mimicking the antioxidant
enzyme activity.2,5,55−58 Our results indicate that nanoceria-sprayed sorghum was highly efficient
in scavenging ROS and increased antioxidant enzyme activity resulting
in lower lipid peroxidation (Figure 4c).

of 10 independent measurements (five replications × two experiment).

2.5 Nanoceria Increase Pollen Germination and
Seed Yield under Drought
Foliar spray of nanoceria in sorghum
plants under drought increased seed yield plant–1 (31%) compared to water-sprayed plants (Figure 5d). Under irrigated conditions, there was
no significant difference between water and nanoceria foliar-sprayed
treatments on seed yield plant–1 (Figure 5d). Seed yield plant–1 is a product of number of seed panicle–1 (seed-set
percent) and individual seed weight. In this study, the seed-set percent
was decreased (24%) by drought relative to irrigated conditions, whereas
foliar spray of nanoceria improved the seed-set percent (13%) relative
to water spray (Figure 5b). The seed-set percent is primarily the result of floret fertility,
which is dependent on pollen and pistil functions, namely, pollination,
fertilization, and grain formation.59 Drought
during the sorghum gametogenesis stage decreased the pollen germination
percent (31%) compared to irrigated conditions, whereas foliar spray
of nanoceria protected pollen germination (10%) under drought relative
to water spray (Figure 5a; Figure S1). Previous studies on other
crop species including rice (Oryza sativa L.),60 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.),61 and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)62 have shown that drought decreases
the pollen germination percent, leading to decreased pod/seed-set
percentage. The reduction in pollen fertility under abiotic stresses
including drought could be a consequence of altered carbohydrate metabolism
in the developing reproductive tissue59,61 and ROS production.63−65 Scavenging of ROS produced under drought stress by nanoceria can
protect lipid membrane damage in reproductive tissues (both pollen
and pistil), resulting in the increased seed-set percentage. Lower
seed-set percentage (lower grain number) may be compensated by higher
individual seed weight (due to the availability of more assimilates
to the developing grain). However, in this study, there was no influence
on individual seed weight (Figure 5c), as the drought was imposed for 21 d from panicle
initiation, during the period affecting grain number through pollen
viability but not individual seed weight. Thus, the increased seed
yield plant–1 by nanoceria under drought was associated
with higher seed-set percent and increased seed numbers.

yield (g panicle–1). Each value is the mean ±
SE of 10 independent measurements (five replications × two experiment).
Means with different letters are significantly different at P ≤ 0.05.

2.6 Nanoceria Enhance Leaf Photosynthetic Rates
under Drought
Drought significantly (P ≤
0.01) decreased chlorophyll index (8%; Figure 6a), photosystem (PS) II quantum yield (12%; Figure 6b), stomatal conductance
(20%; Figure 6c), and
carbon assimilation rates (23%; Figure 6d) compared to irrigated controls. However, nanoceria
foliar spray increased chlorophyll index (5%; Figure 6a), PSII quantum yield (8%; Figure 6b), stomatal conductance (7%; Figure 6c), and carbon assimilation
rates (16%; Figure 6d) compared to water-sprayed plants. Stomata control the exchange
of water vapor and CO2, between the interior of the leaf
and the atmosphere.66 Under drought, the
generation of H2O267 activates abscisic acid signaling pathway leading to closure of
stomata.68 However, in the nanoceria-sprayed
plants, decreased contents of H2O2 (Figure 6b) could have downregulated
chloroplast H2O2-mediated stomatal closure.
Drought alters the carbon fixation metabolism by a combination of
both stomatal and nonstomatal limitations.19−21 In this study,
the relative contribution of stomatal limitations, that is, stomatal
conductance (∼20%) was greater than the nonstomatal limitations,
namely, quantum yield of PSII (∼12%) toward decreasing the
photosynthetic rate under drought.69 The
stomatal limitations may promote an imbalance between PSII photochemistry
and electron requirement for photosynthesis, eventually leading to
an overexcitation and damage to PSII reaction centers.70 The ROS is involved in chlorophyll degradation
and damage of chloroplast proteins and membranes, resulting in decreased
photosynthetic rates.71 Nanoceria catalyze
the quenching of ROS produced in chloroplasts by the oxygen vacancies
in the CeO2 lattice structure,3 leading to improved photosynthesis and chlorophyll content index.

assimilation rates. (a) Chlorophyll index (SPAD units), (b) PSII quantum
yield (Fv/Fm ratio; unit less), (c) stomatal conductance (mmol H2O

rates (μmol CO2 m–2 s–1). Each value is the mean ± SE of 10 independent measurements
(five replications × two experiment). Means with different letters
are significantly different at P ≤ 0.05.

Leaf morphology analysis indicated
that under drought, water-sprayed
plants exhibit cuticle wax disintegration (Figure 7c). However, the nanoceria-sprayed plants
had intact epicuticular wax (Figure 7d). There was no variation in leaf mesophyll and vascular
bundle cell anatomy by drought or foliar spray treatments (Figure S2). In sorghum, leaf epicuticular wax
accumulation is positively correlated with the canopy temperature
depression (ability of plant to cool itself) under drought.72 Drought-stressed plants treated with foliar-sprayed
water exhibit disintegrated leaf cuticular wax layers.73 The intact epicuticular wax in nanoceria foliar-sprayed
plants may have been due to increase in evapotranspiration leaf cooling
associated with higher stomatal conductance.

3 Conclusions
Herein, we have demonstrated that under drought, foliar application
of nanoceria protected and maintained carbon assimilation rates and
pollen germination, resulting in higher seed-set percent and seed
yield plant–1. The increases in photosynthetic rates
and pollen germination percentage were associated with efficient scavenging
of ROS produced under drought stress by nanoceria, leading to decreased
membrane lipid peroxidation. The toxicity assays performed using murine
cell line culture indicate that the concentration for the 50% maximal
effect [effective concentration (EC)50] of nanoceria was
more than 100 mg L–1. Thus, the levels of the nanoceria
used in this study do not exhibit toxic effects on mammalian cells.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Nanoceria
Nanoceria were synthesized as detailed by Ketzial
and Nesaraj37 and Karakoti et al.74 using cerium(III) nitrate as a precursor. Multimode
scanning probe
microscopy (NTMDT-NTEGRA, Russia) was used to study the surface topography
height under ambient conditions (25 ± 2 °C) using a semicontact
mode probe. The morphology and microstructure of the prepared nanoceria
were studied by TEM (Tecnai Spirit G2, 120 kV, The Netherlands, an
acceleration voltage of 120 kV) and HRTEM (JEOL JEM 2100, Japan, an
acceleration voltage of 200 kV), respectively. The selected-area electron
diffraction (SAED) and EDX of the nanoceria were studied using HRTEM.
The powder XRD analysis was done using a diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima
IV XRD, Japan) in the 2θ range of 20°–60° utilizing
Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, and λ = 1.5405 Å),
with a scan speed of 5° min–1. Crystallinity
of the sample was obtained through the crystalline-amorphous peak
deconvolution process using a Gaussian function. The FT-IR spectrum
of nanoceria was recorded using JASCO FT-IR 6800, Japan, fitted with
a diamond enabled attenuated total reflectance sample holder and a
deuterated lanthanum α alanine-doped triglycine sulfate detector.
The wavelength range was from 400 to 4000 cm–1.
TGA of the samples was performed using a PerkinElmer STA 600 instrument.

4.2 Toxicity of Nanoceria to Mammalian Cells
The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design.
The mouse fibroblast L929 cell line was procured from ATCC, India,
and used in MTT and DAPI assays with and without nanoceria as explained
by Djanaguiraman et al.75 In the MTT assay,
the cell viability was calculated as the ratio of optical density
(OD) of the nanoceria-treated cells to OD of the control cells and
expressed as percentage. For DAPI staining, the mouse fibroblast cell
line was seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells per
well) and cultured overnight to adhere on the well, after that different
concentrations of nanoceria (0, 100, 250, and 500 mg L–1) were added and left for 48 h. After completion of the reaction,
the fibroblast cells were washed and fixed using phosphate-buffered
saline and 70% ethanol. Then, the cells were stained with 2.0 mg L–1 DAPI for 15 min and viewed under an inverted fluorescence
microscope (Nikon Ti-SEclipse, Japan). The image shown is representative
of 10 randomly observed fields.

4.3 Uptake
of Nanoceria in Plants
River
sand was collected, dried in air, and sieved through a 2 mm sieve
(sieve number 10), and the fraction that does not pass through the
sieve was discarded. The collected soil fraction (<2 mm) was again
sieved through a 1 mm sieve (sieve number 20), and the fraction that
does not pass through sieve (very coarse sand) was collected and soaked
in aqua regia (3:1 HCl/HNO3 acid ratio, 10 mL per g of
sand) for 1 day and then washed thoroughly four times with double
distilled water. Then, the soil was air-dried for 48 h and used for
nanoceria uptake study as described by Djanaguiraman et al.75 In brief, the sorghum var. CO 30 was sown and
grown in acid-washed sand by irrigating with one-quarter-strength
Hoagland solution till 2 weeks. After that the plants were irrigated
with either one-quarter-strength Hoagland solution or one-quarter-strength
Hoagland solution containing 50 or 100 mg L–1 nanoceria.
The seedlings were maintained for 10 days and then uprooted carefully
without any damage to the roots. The roots and shoots were dried in
an oven at 40 °C for 72 h, and their cerium content was determined
using inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry
(PerkinElmer optima, OPTIMA 2000 DV, Waltham, MA) following an established
procedure.76

4.4 Impact
of Nanoceria on Sorghum Plants under
Drought
4.4.1 Crop Husbandry
Two independent
outdoor pot-culture experiments were conducted in a randomized complete
block with a split plot treatment structure at Department of Nano
Science and Technology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore
(11°N; 77°E; 426.7 m MSL), India. The main and subplots
were irrigation level and foliar sprays, respectively. The main plot
had two levels (control: plants maintained at 100% pot capacity moisture;
and drought stress: withholding water for 21 d). The subplot had two
levels (control: foliar spray of water and foliar spray of nanoceria
at a concentration of 10 mg L–1). There were 10
pots (replications) for each treatment combination.

Sandy clay
loam soil (pH of 7.7, electrical conductivity of 0.33 dS m–1, organic carbon of 0.54%) was collected from university farm, air-dried,
sieved (<3–5 mm sieve size), homogenized, and filled in
an earthen pot (30 cm diameter and 15 kg capacity) having small hole
at the bottom to drain excess water to a weight of 10 kg. The soil
was low in available nitrogen (205 kg ha–1), high
in available phosphorus (25 kg ha–1), and potassium
(458 kg ha–1). Five seeds of sorghum var. CO 30
were sown in each pot at a depth of 3 cm. After emergence, plants
were thinned to three plants per pot until maturity. The crop was
grown until imposition of drought as detailed by Djanaguiraman et
al.63 At flag leaf visible stage (tip of
the flag leaf is visible in the whorl, 50 days after sowing), the
primary stalk/panicle was tagged to recording pollen germination,
seed-set percentage, and seed yield plant–1. The
flag and subtending leaves of the tagged plants were used for assessing
various physiological and biochemical traits. The middle portion of
the flag leaf was used for leaf anatomical studies. Till start of
the booting stage (60 days after sowing), the plants were maintained
under a moisture level of 100% pot capacity. After that, the water
was withheld for 21 days for the drought treatment and the corresponding
irrigated plants (control) were maintained under a moisture level
of 100% pot capacity.

The plants in five pots were used for
leaf physiological, biochemical,
and anatomical studies. The other five pots were used for assessing
pollen germination, seed-set percent, and seed yield plant–1. On the day of water withhold, the drought and irrigated plants
were foliar-sprayed with water or 10 mg L–1 of nanoceria.
Foliar spray of water or nanoceria was done once. Each pot was sprayed
with 600 mL of spray solution, that is, 6 mg of nanoceria for three
plants–1. Previous studies and present murine cell
line toxicity assays have shown that LD50 for nanoceria
is more than 100 mg of nanoceria L–1. A 10 times
lower value of LD50 (10 mg L–1) was used
as nanoceria concentration for foliar spray treatments. After 21 days
of drought, the plants were irrigated to 100% pot capacity and maintained
till physiological maturity. The control plants were maintained under
100% pot capacity from sowing to physiological maturity.

4.4.2 Chlorophyll Index, Quantum Yield of PSII,
and Leaf Gas Exchange
The chlorophyll index, PSII fluorescence,
and leaf gas exchange were recorded on the attached, fully expanded
flag leaves of tagged plants at midday (between 10:00 and 14:00 h),
as described in Djanaguiraman et al.75 The
photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were recorded using a
portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400, LICOR, Lincoln, Nebraska,
USA). The CO2 concentration in the leaf chamber of the
photosynthesis system was set to 400 μmol mol–1, with a flow rate of 500 μmol s–1 and a
light intensity of 1500 μmol m–2 s–1 of photosynthetically active radiation supplied by red-blue light-emitting
diode. The measurements were recorded at ambient relative humidity
and temperature.

4.4.3 ROS and MDA Content
At the anthesis
stage, the flag and the subtending leaves were excised from the tagged
plants between 11:00 and 13:00 h and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen, transported to laboratory, and stored in −20 °C
until further analysis. Superoxide anion was estimated according to
Chaitanya and Naithani77 and expressed
as change in OD min–1 g–1 on fresh
weight (FW) basis. The frozen leaf samples were homogenized in 5 mL
of ice-cold 0.2 mol sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 containing 10–3 mol diethyl dithiocarbamate. The homogenate was immediately
centrifuged for 1 min at 3000g, and the superoxide
anion was measured using nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (2.5 ×
10–4 mol). The H2O2 levels
were measured by following the method described by Patterson et al.78 using 20% titanium chloride reagent and expressed
in nmol g–1 FW. The lipid peroxidation was determined
by MDA content produced by thiobarbitaric acid as described by Behera
et al.79 expressed as MDA content in nmol
g–1 FW. Briefly, the frozen leaf samples were homogenized
in 5 mL of 0.1% trichloroacetic acid, after that the homogenate was
centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000g. From the
supernatant, 0.3 mL was taken and mixed with 1.2 mL of 0.5% thiobarbitaric
acid prepared in 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubated in a water
bath maintained at 95 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped
by keeping the test tube in an ice-bath for 5 min and centrifuged
for 10 min at 10 000g. The absorbance at 532
and 600 nm was recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (SPECORD
PLUS 210, Analytikjena, Jena, Germany). The detailed procedure of
quantification of oxidants and membrane damage was available elsewhere.80

4.4.4 Antioxidant Enzyme Activity
The
frozen leaf samples were homogenized in ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer pH
7.8 containing 1 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, 1 mM dithiotreitol,
and 5 mL of 4% polyvinyl pyrrolidone g–1 FW. The
homogenate was centrifuged at 20 000g at 4
°C. The supernatant was used to measure SOD, CAT, and POX enzyme
activity. SOD was determined as explained by Beyer and Fridovich,81 using a SOD assay kit (19160 SOD, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, Missouri, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
One unit of SOD is the amount of enzyme needed to obtain 50% dismutation
of superoxide radical on leaf FW basis and expressed as enzyme units.
The CAT activity was quantified by Aebi82 by monitoring the decline in the absorbance at 240 nm because of
decomposition of H2O2. One enzyme unit was the
amount of CAT enzyme that decomposes 1.0 μmol H2O2 min–1 g–1 of tissue on
leaf FW basis and expressed as enzyme units. The POX activity was
quantified by Gerbling et al.83 The hydrogen peroxide-dependent
oxidation of ascorbate was monitored by a decrease in absorbance at
290 nm after addition of H2O2. One enzyme unit
was the amount of POX enzyme that oxidizes 1.0 μmol ascorbate
min–1 g–1 of tissue on leaf FW
basis and expressed as enzyme units. Detailed procedure of enzyme
extraction and method of quantification were explained in Jincy et
al.80

4.4.5 Leaf
Anatomical Studies
To determine
the effect of water and nanoceria foliar spray on epicuticular wax
integrity and leaf anatomy, the flag leaf was collected on the day
of anthesis and immediately dipped in supercooled ethanol. The middle
portions of leaf were cut into small size using a surgical knife.
The upper portion of the leaf was placed on the double stick carbon
tape affixed to a carbon stub and viewed with a scanning electron
microscope (SEM; Quanta 250, FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) in ESEM
mode fitted with a large field detector (LFD). The SEM was operated
at low vacuum, 10 kV, with a spot size of 4 and a pressure of 60 Pa.
The sample images were taken at ×1500 magnification. Similarly,
the cross-sectional area of the leaf was mounted by affixing in the
vertical position and viewed with SEM in the ESEM mode fitted with
a LFD. The SEM was operated at the above conditions, and the images
were acquired at ×300 magnification.

4.4.6 Pollen
Germination, Seed-Set Percent, and
Seed Yield Plant–1
At anthesis, pollen
grains were collected as described elsewhere and germinated in the
medium as explained by Djanaguiraman et al.63 The tagged panicles were harvested at physiological maturity, dried
at 40 °C for 7 days, and hand-threshed. The seed-set percentage
and seed yield plant–1 were quantified according
to Djanaguiraman et al.63

4.5 Data Analyses
The data were analyzed
using SAS program. The data on physiological, biochemical, yield components,
and toxicity assay were analyzed using the PROC GLM procedure of SAS.
The data from each experiment were statistically analyzed independently
and found that there were no significant differences. Therefore, the
data from both the experiments were pooled together for combined statistical
analyses, and the mean responses are presented. The standard error
was shown as an estimate of variability, and means of various variables
were separated for significance by the LSD test at a probability level
of 0.05.
