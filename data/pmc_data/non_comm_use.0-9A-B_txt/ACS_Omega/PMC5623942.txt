Solubility
enhancement and thus higher bioavailability are of great
importance and a constant challenge in pharmaceutical research whereby
polymorph screening and selection is one of the most important tasks.
A very promising approach for polymorph screening is solvent vapor
annealing where a sample is exposed to an atmosphere saturated with
molecules of a specific chemical/solvent. In this work, amorphous
carbamazepine thin films were prepared by spin coating, and the transformation
into crystalline forms under exposure to solvent vapors was investigated.
Employing grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, four distinct carbamazepine
polymorphs, a solvate, and hydrates could be identified, while optical
microscopy showed mainly spherulitic morphologies. In vitro dissolution experiments revealed different carbamazepine release
from the various thin-film samples containing distinct polymorphic
compositions: heat treatment of amorphous samples at 80 °C results
in an immediate release; samples exposed to EtOH vapors show a drug
release about 5 times slower than this immediate one; and all the
others had intermediate release profiles. Noteworthy, even the sample
of slowest release has a manifold faster release compared to a standard
powder sample demonstrating the capabilities of thin-film preparation
for faster drug release in general. Despite the small number of samples
in this screening experiment, the results clearly show how solvent
vapor annealing can assist in identifying potential polymorphs and
allows for estimating their impact on properties like bioavailability.

Introduction
The search for polymorphic
crystal forms is necessary to identify
favorable properties for various fields.1−6 For active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), polymorphs should
remain unchanged over the shelf-life time7,8 and
be compatible with excipients and processes, and their production
has to be very reproducible.9 As such,
many screening experiments are applied to generate and discover new,
potentially best suited and stable polymorphs.

Many different
approaches exist which all aim at generating different
processing pathways for finding new polymorphs. Bulk crystallization
experiments employ seeding,10 different
solvents,5,6,11 degree of
saturation, and varying temperature, among others, to enable the production
of new polymorphs which in other terms just represent the fact that
the energy landscape is screened.12 Even
the usage of structure prediction methods is becoming more important
as potential new polymorphs might be more easily accessible in-silico but with the prediction rate exhausting physical
capabilities.2,12−14

In recent
years, optimization in thin-film technologies enables
addition of new functionalities to surfaces which may assist in further
stages or can even be used directly within application. As the simplest
technique, the usage of the drop casting technique in terms of printing
yields high quality deposition of inks for newspaper, organic electronic
materials for solar cells,15 and transistors.16 Even personalized medication could become reality
soon.17−21 Spin coating, dip coating, and vacuum deposition enable similar
modifications to surfaces. Further, these deposition techniques are
capable of adjusting the polymorphic form as well as the morphology;
e.g., three different polymorphs of DH6T can be obtained by process
parameter variation.22 Phenytoin can be
processed so that at least nine different morphologies can be set
without changing the polymorph,23 and even
new polymorphs were found by applying such thin-film techniques.24−26 The dissolution studies on the new phenytoin polymorph even showed
to be of faster nature compared to the other form which again demonstrates
the importance of polymorph screening in pharmaceutical research in
general.

Very often, solution processing of drug molecules enables
achieving
homogeneous thin films at a solid substrate surface. Depending on
the processing conditions the films might be crystalline or amorphous.
Employing faster processing like present in spin coating, amorphous
phases frequently remain after solvent removal as found in samples
of acetometaphene,8 clotrimazole,27−29 or phenytoin.24,26,30 Having such an amorphous film, crystallization routes distinct from
standard bulk solution processes can be tested. For instance, mechanical
stressing using atomic force microscopy30 might be employed for understanding crystallization in more detail.
Another more common approach is temperature treatment:26 higher temperatures favor molecular diffusion,
facilitating nucleation, and finally resulting in crystallization.
In a similar manner, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an excellent
tool for changing the environmental parameters for crystal growth
processes.24,28,31 Here, a sample is exposed to a solvent vapor of any chemical composition,
similar to isothermal calorimetry experiments employing defined humidity
levels and dynamic vapor sorption experiments. In the vapor phase
solvent molecules interact with the molecules in the drug film which
eventually facilitates specific crystallization into a defined polymorphic
form (or morphology). Hereby the solvent–vapor interaction
strength might be estimated using the Hansen-solubility parameters.28 Using such a solvent vapor annealing treatment,
the second polymorphic form of phenytoin was also accessible, while
up to recently this polymorph was just accessible using drop casting
under very defined conditions (temperature and solute concentration).
SVA on clotrimazole thin films was unable to generate new polymorphs,28 but strong changes in the morphology/crystal
habit could be obtained. Having a chance to change only the habit
(size and shape) provides the possibility to understand its role in
the overall dissolution performance, i.e., how different facets or
surface areas change the release from thin films.

In this work,
it is demonstrated how the solvent vapor process
can be utilized to deliver information on a potentially better sample
state with faster dissolution properties. As the model substance here,
carbamazepine (CBZ) is used. In general, carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant
used to treat epileptic seizures and nerve pain such as trigeminal
neuralgia. CBZ is a Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class II
molecule, possessing low solubility and high permeability. The poor
dissolution performance has most likely the biggest influence on the
bioavailability, driving the search for ideal formulations providing
enhanced properties and finally resulting in a higher bioavailability.
Deriving a better understanding for handling this problem might remain
one target in research as many (∼40%) new chemical entities
identified in screening are prone to fail due to their low water solubility.
As one of the best ways to improve this situation, polymorph screening
studies are advised. A simple change in the molecular arrangement
(each polymorph is distinct) hereby might strongly change the lattice
free energy reflected in a better solubility.

CBZ is a wonderful
material to study such effects in more detail
as it is prototypical for drug molecules with its hydrogen bonding
potential. Especially, the formation of multiple readily accessible
polymorphic forms32 makes it an interesting
candidate for fundamental research, like structure prediction,33,34 the screening process in general, or for this work. Fast processing
of CBZ results in amorphous films of sufficient stability so that
different film treatments can be tested, inducing deviating polymorphic
forms and morphologies. Using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction35,36 and optical microscopy the impacts of the various treatments on
the solid state properties are elucidated and discussed. Dissolution
experiments assist in the identification of candidates for possible
applications of potentially high bioavailability.

Results
Layer Thickness
Dependent Morphology
Spin coating carbamazepine
solutions onto silicon wafers initially results in the formation of
dry, homogeneous, and optically transparent layers which are amorphous.
Upon storage at ambient conditions, such samples crystallize eventually.
The initial CBZ concentration in solution has thereby a profound impact
on the initial layer thickness. At the highest concentration employed
in this study (16 mg/g), a film thickness of 157 nm was determined
by X-ray reflectivity (data not shown). Halving the concentration
value, so that a solution of 8 mg/g is used, the thickness reduces
to 74 nm. Diluting the solution further the thickness reduces, whereby
a minimum layer thickness of 3 nm was obtained at a concentration
of 0.5 mg/g. The different thicknesses reflect the fact that the amount
of CBZ for the crystallization process is different in each sample.
In Figure 1, optical
micrographs of various samples 48 h after thin-film fabrication are
depicted. For the lowest concentration, i.e., the thinnest film, few
individual crystals randomly distributed at the silica surface are
found. The needle-like shapes are about 100 μm long and are
some micrometers wide. As the layer thickness increases to 8 nm, the
spatial density of the needles increases, while leaving the size (almost)
unaffected. In addition, a few smaller, dot-like structures appear,
most likely of crystalline character. Reaching 17 nm, some interconnection
with respect to each other exists, typical for the initial state of
spherulitic growth. Here the crystals are accompanied by some vacant
areas. While the film after deposition constitutes a homogeneous dense
layer, nucleation and further crystal growth come at the expense of
smaller crystallites, leaving these areas depleted. This is generally
referred to as Ostwald ripening.37 At 38
nm thickness, extended spherulitic structures with several hundreds
of micrometer diameter emerge.

Figure 1 Optical micrographs of crystallized CBZ
thin films as a function
of the layer thickness obtained from different solute concentration
after storage under ambient conditions.

It takes an 8 mg/g CBZ–THF solution to achieve a thickness
of 74 nm which can provide a crystalline layer covering the entire
substrate surface. In this sample, the spherulitic character remains
but shows significantly increased dimensions. Individual spherulite
branches are absent as the individual branches pack densely. At 158
nm thickness, the most obvious difference is the change in color,
which results from a change in the crystal thickness compared to the
74 nm sample. In the spherulite centers, the color is blueish, while
in the other areas more orange/yellowish colors appear. Homogeneously
spread, there are also some darker areas, which are likely the result
of the dot-like structures noticed in thinner films being developed
into more extended structures.

Solvent Vapor Annealing
For solvent vapor annealing
and subsequent dissolution experiments, the thickest carbamazepine
amorphous films were used (i.e., samples were prepared only from a
16 mg/g CBZ–THF solution). This way, a dense layer can (mostly)
be maintained during solvent vapor treatment, and a larger carbamazepine
fraction is available for diffraction and dissolution experiments.
Depending on the treatment of the samples, drastic changes in the
CBZ morphology occur. In Figure 2, optical micrographs of the various samples are summarized
after their individual treatments. (For the sake of completeness the
very same spots are also examined under crossed polarizers, and the
data are provided in the Supporting Information section.) Hereby, the samples are ranked by their dissolution
rate, starting from those of slowest release (EtOH vapor sample) to
the highest, which is the sample only heat treated at 80 °C directly
after sample preparation.

Figure 2 Various samples after heat treatment at different
temperatures
or being exposed to solvent vapor for 48 h. Sequence of images corresponds
to their respective dissolution rate, ranging from lowest (top left)
to highest (bottom right).

The different treatments of the samples results in the appearance
of each sample being different, whereby similarities between individual
samples exist. In all samples the crystalline CBZ coated the entire
surface, and only in the sample just heat treated at 80 °C is
the crystalline film disrupted; thus, some vacant areas exist. This
sample shows clear spherulitic structures with distinct boundaries
in between. In the disrupted area less densely packed spherulites
exist. The xylene sample appears similarly homogeneous. A closer look
under crossed polarizers weakly shows the presence of a Maltesian
cross typical for spherulitic growth (see Supporting Information).

The sample treated at 45 °C and 75%
RH as well as the samples
exposed to IPA or THF vapor reveal two distinct types of spherulites,
one appearing blueish in color and the other similar to the one observed
in the xylene-treated sample and appears brownish. The sample exposed
to EtOH vapor reveals the largest blueish spherulites of all samples
investigated in this study, nearly covering the entire surface. Besides
this, structures with an extension of even some micrometers are present.
As these areas appear dark under crossed polarizers, they could be
amorphous or consist of a crystal phase which is not birefringent.
Similar structures also appear in most of the other samples but with
their extension and frequency being smaller. The samples exposed to
acetonitrile vapor or heat treated at 50 °C show brownish and
blueish spherulites whereby the amount or frequency of these two structures
seems to be vice versa.

Crystal Structure
In order to investigate
the crystal
structure/polymorphic form, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD)
measurements were performed. In such an experiment, the shallow incidence
angle allows measuring diffraction from very thin films.35,36,38 An exemplary map is shown in Figure 3a for the sample
after acetonitrile vapor annealing. Having an area detector, this
allows identifying Debye–Scherrer type ring structures at different
separations from the beam center (at around pixels x = 764, y = 824). In general, concentric rings in
the pattern result from crystals behaving like a powder without preferred
orientation (texture) whereby each ring corresponds to a defined net
plane distance. (In GIXD measurements, the rings are disrupted in
the lower half by the presence of the substrate so that only ring
segments can be measured.) In all samples, the mostly powder-like
character prevailed. Only in some samples a weak preferred orientation
exist, which means that some crystal contact planes occur slightly
more frequently along a certain direction than others. Figure 3b shows an example, which depicts
the results of a sample heat treated at 50 °C. In the middle
of the image, located at pixels x = 764 and y = 640, higher intensities are detected. In a GIXD image,
this region corresponds to information from packing nearly parallel
to the sample surface; i.e., the corresponding net plane is parallel
to the substrate surface. The observed textures found for the individual
samples are summarized in Table 1. The two sharp peaks in the pattern at pixels x = 400, y = 580 and x = 1100, y = 580, respectively, stem from the substrate;
the silicon wafer is a 001 cut, making these peaks the 111 reflections
diffracting into these very positions.

axis for clarity.

For the sake of polymorph identification,
these 2-dimensional data
are integrated to yield a representation of intensity as a function
of the absolute scattering vector q (information
on the scattering direction is lost, and only information on the d-spacing is extractable). Often this is referred to as
a powder plot. These integrated diffraction curves are provided in Figure 4. Independent of
the sample, all curves contain peaks showing that each preparation
route induced crystallization in the films which might already be
expected from the microscopy images. At small scattering vectors the
spectra contain a high diffraction background which reduces for larger
scattering vectors. Such background behavior is due to air scattering
from the primary beam, causing X-rays to bypass the beam stop. This
behavior is identical for all samples and does not disturb the diffraction
signal from the crystalline fraction of the samples, thus being of
no further importance for the data analysis. On top of this background,
distinct Bragg peaks are visible. From their position, the polymorphic
form(s) of the respective sample is deduced by comparison with theoretical
peak positions. The naming convention of the individual polymorphs
here follows a previous report32 whereby
the list of the individual unit-cell parameters is provided in the SI.

Figure 4 Powder plots extracted from the grazing incidence
X-ray diffraction
patterns. Data are shifted for clarity. Order of appearance compared
to dissolution results and microscopy images.

For example, using the example of the AN-treated sample of Figure 3a, the peak at q = 0.35 Å–1 (d spacing
17.95 Å) is explained by the 2–10 peak of CBZ form II.
The peak at q = 0.67 Å–1 (d spacing 9.38 Å) results from the 0–12 reflection
of the CBZ form I structure, whereas the peak at 0.62 Å–1 (d spacing 10.13 Å) is again explained by
form II being the 300 reflection. This means this sample consists
of two forms, i.e., forms I and II. In a similar fashion, the CBZ
phases of the different samples are identified. The evaluations of
all curves from Figure 4 are summarized in Table 1.

The results reveal that many of the samples consist
of multiple
polymorphs. Only heat treatment at higher temperature (50 and 80 °C)
results in solely forms I–III being present. Form III is also
found for the as-delivered powder, i.e., the polymorph which is provided
by the supplier (see SI and Table 1). Further, the formation of
solvates is noted on the exposure of EtOH or IPA or after storage
at elevated humidity. Characteristic of carbamazepine form II are,
in most cases, empty channels, in which, however, THF can be incorporated.39,40 In terms of lattice parameters, this structure is very similar to
the standard form II, which is why they cannot be differentiated from
the experimental data.

Dissolution
As an estimate for the
bioavailability
of CBZ from these different samples, dissolution studies were performed.
For the sake of comparability, each sample was measured under identical
conditions. Starting with the sample stored at 40 °C and high
humidity of 75%, the release of CBZ over time increases as the time
progresses (see blue curve in Figure 5a). After 10 min, nearly 75% of the material is released
from the silica surface. Another 15 min is required, i.e., a total
time of 25 min, to dissolve all of the CBZ from the sample surface
into the surrounding media. In comparison to that, storing the sample
at ambient conditions or at an elevated temperature of 50 °C
results in a quicker CBZ release so that already after 4 min about
75% of the entire drug amount is released. After this the ambient
stored sample is slightly faster in its release, while the 50 °C
one seems to have a reduced dissolution rate so that it takes around
30 min for the entire material to be dissolved. The sample heat treated
at 80 °C releases most of the drug within 3 min, from which it
can be assumed that this sample shows an immediate release.

Figure 5 Carbamazepine
release as a function of time for samples treated
under the presence of only water (a) and under different organic solvent
vapors (b). Both diagrams share a common abscissa.

Using different organic solvents for the vapor
treatment, the dissolution
profiles change. EtOH vapor-treated samples show rather slow drug
release, taking about 10 min to release 70% and another 35 min (total
45 min) to achieve 100% release. By using IPA or THF for the SVA process
the initial CBZ release can be increased, but for all of these samples
the maximum is reached only after 30 min. It can be expected that
100% release is achieved slightly faster than for the EtOH sample,
but the low amount of data points at this time frame does not allow
clarification. Treating samples with xylene or AN results in very
fast releases of nearly 90% in 5 min but still slower than the sample
treated at 80 °C.

To gain numbers for comparison, a regression
fit to the dissolution
data was performed. A lot of different mathematical descriptions aim
to provide some understanding of the dissolution behavior.41 As only one layer is at hand and also sink conditions
are chosen, the situation is sufficiently described by a homogeneous
model (often referred to as first-order release). The formula used
for the evaluation is given by 1  whereby
the concentration C as a function of time t is equal to the maximum
concentration (Cs) minus an exponential
decay over time with the exponent representing the fastness of drug
release. For the evaluation of our samples, Cs is kept at 100% for all samples so that the only fitting
parameter is a. The values for the various samples
are tabulated in Table 1, ranging from 0.11 for the sample exposed to the EtOH vapor, representing
a slow dissolution, up to 1.86 for the sample heat treated at 80 °C
which showed the fastest dissolution.

A dissolution experiment
was also performed for the pristine CBZ
powder as obtained from the supplier. Hereby, some of the powder was
introduced into a vessel containing the same dissolution medium as
used for the thin-film samples, and the increase in CBZ concentration
over time was determined. Similar to the other samples, the amount
of material released (dissolved) increased with progressing time.
The drug release was about 5 times slower compared to the EtOH sample
which was the sample with the slowest CBZ release from a thin-film
surface after treatment. An X-ray diffraction experiment shows that
the pristine powder sample obtained from the supplier was of pure
form III (data provided in the SI).

Discussion
CBZ possesses a rather complex phase behavior with a lot of different
polymorphic forms resulting from sample preparation using varying
experimental conditions. Within this study, the anhydrous forms I,
II, III, and IV were found in different compositions. Indications
of formation of form V were absent. Form V might be accessible from
amorphous thin films of CBZ using different solvents, different temperatures,
or combinations thereof or even a transformation from one of the other
polymorphic phases. As the method used is very versatile, expanding
these experiments is simple in order to explore additional forms.

Using experimental parameters that are easily accessible by tuning
the temperature and the water content in the surrounding, our approach
is directly adaptable for any manufacturing or drug formulation. In
many areas, especially in pharmaceutical manufacturing, the usage
of organic solvents should be limited or is even permitted. However,
in an experiment, where harm to the environment or living organism
can be prevented, such screening processes can be simply extended
to more and/or even toxic solvents which might increase the chance
of finding more (new) polymorphs or even leading to solvates. Following
the procedures described in this work, only some of the amorphous
films could be transferred into the crystalline state containing only
a single polymorphic form. Likely, more optimization can provide monomorphic
films. Recently it was demonstrated that SVA on crystalline samples
can also induce changes of a crystalline polymorphic form, which might
be associated with a solid–solid transition.31 A temperature treatment step can also help to reduce the
amount of one species on account of the other(s) if this one is less
stable. Combinations of different solvents within one exposure step
might provide a sufficient environment to achieve more specific crystallization,
but as such adjustments correspond more to process optimizations rather
than a screening process this has not been of interest here.

Spin coating is very versatile in means of drug layer thickness,
so that the carbamazepine amount can be adjusted easily. In this study,
the focus was put on film thicknesses in which the crystalline CBZ
starts covering the entire sample surface. As noticeable in Figure 1, thinner films still
provide information on the CBZ crystallization, but in these cases,
the solvent–API–substrate interactions are more complicated.
Large areas of the substrate surface are exposed, which is often referred
to as dewetting or depletion of the circumjacent area of a growing
crystal, which can cause the appearance of different morphologies.
In our spin-coated samples a maximum amount of CBZ of about 100 μg
would be achievable. Above this amount, crystallization is often initiated
rapidly on account of being close to saturation concentration, leaving
no time for the SVA process to be performed on amorphous CBZ. For
most drugs this small amount is likely too low for therapy which might
reduce the usage of spin coating in an upscale process. Employing
other thin-film technologies like drop casting (dropping the solution
onto a substrate followed by evaporation of the solvent), dip coating
(withdrawal of a substrate from a solid solution under defined velocities),
or a simple vacuum deposition process,24,30the amount
of CBZ on the surface might be strongly increased. As far as drop
casting is concerned, much more material can be deposited, but the
process velocity is limited which also limits amorphous layer formation.
Dip coating, on the other hand, can be utilized to grow crystals of
defined textures, which can tune the dissolution properties further.
Recently also jet spraying of materials was demonstrated to achieve
amorphous layers containing a large amount of drugs.42,43

Drug dissolution is complex and according to the Noyes–Whitney44 equation depends on the diffusion coefficient,
boundary layer thickness, maximum solubility, and the drug concentration
in the surrounding and the surface area. In fact, all our samples
could be described by a first-order release, reflecting the fact that
the underlying dissolution mechanism is, to the level of accuracy
within our experiment, unaffected. Many experiments demonstrate that
the polymorphic form impacts the dissolution behavior, as the different
lattice and surface energies, among others, suggest that an altered
interaction with the drug film takes place. In our experiments, the
sample heat treated at 80 °C resulted in spherulitic structures
homogeneously distributed over the entire surface, whereby only form
III could be identified. The dissolution of this sample proceeded
rapidly and was in fact the fastest of all samples investigated. Especially,
the comparison with the as-obtained powder shows a 2 orders of magnitude
faster release. The reason for this is the surface area being larger;
a widespread thin film has a much bigger surface compared to some
large powder particles even though it contains the same amount of
material. Also, the microscopic roughness is very likely much larger
compared to bulk grown crystals, and a lot of pores might exist in
spin-coated samples which in addition enhance the surface area significantly.
Having now a tool at hand that enables spreading drugs over large
areas, this is another well-suited application for identifying potential
limitations in the drug release on account of size reduction.

There are several treatments found which cause amorphous–crystalline
transitions which then result in the drug release being very similar.
This involves storing the sample at 50 °C or at ambient conditions
and exposure to AN or xylene vapors. Surprisingly, the sample stored
at ambient conditions has a completely different composition in terms
of polymorphic form: forms III and IV are identified. In the other
three samples, clearly form I exists, while also some form II is found
in the AN and xylene sample. From the microscopy images, the samples
appear different, at least in the amount of the individual structures
being present. This would allow concluding that the change in the
polymorphic form might change the dissolution properties, but this
is counteracted by changes in the morphology. Likely, the deviation
on the microscale in terms of surface area or even in the boundary
layer formation can explain their similar dissolution profiles. Nevertheless,
the experiment shows that four different routes are at hand that can
provide samples of very comparable dissolution performance, so that
fabrication optimization is not limited to a specific route. Nevertheless,
the dissolution performance is worse when compared to the sample heated
to 80 °C. While their surfaces seem to be similarly coated, the
morphology might differ at the microscopic scale. At 80 °C more
energy for diffusion is at hand which often allows growing structures
in directions independent of the substrate surface which can even
lead to crystal growth perpendicular to the substrate surface rather
than parallel to it. Such a behavior would then lead to the solid
state of the 80 °C sample being more porous; i.e., it has a lower
density which provides easier access for the dissolution medium, and
thus faster dissolution is observable.

The sample exposed to
THF vapor shows a somehow intermediate release
rate with the rate constant a being around 0.2 which
is smaller than the one previously discussed (∼0.4–1.8).
The X-ray investigation shows that this sample contains form II of
CBZ, but also some of the crystals are solvates made from THF and
CBZ. While this finding is very interesting in a screening process
and for fundamental understanding, the usage of this very vapor might
not be justified in any application as harm to the patient might occur.

There are several samples which contain hydrates besides anhydrous
CBZ phases. In general, hydrate forms are expected to be less soluble
in an aqueous dissolution media as they already contain water, and
thus the free energy released when starting to interact with water
is less for hydrates compared to anhydrate forms. This behavior is
also clearly noticeable for samples investigated here, with samples
containing hydrate forms having a values (from eq 1) of about half compared
to those of the anhydrates. This is in agreement with previous findings
of dissolution rate reduction of CBZ on the incorporation of H2O into the crystal structure.45

Grazing incident X-ray diffraction is an excellent tool as
it provides
information on very thin films in terms of polymorphic forms but also
on the texture. Texture results in crystals contacting the substrate
surface with preferred crystal planes. This might be due to the processing
conditions or due to the interaction of the substrate with the drug,
inducing specific molecular arrangements during crystallization. In
this study, only some of the samples revealed preferred orientations;
e.g., form I in the 50 °C treated sample reveals a preferable
contact with the 140 plane. Most of the other CBZ forms show arbitrary
contact with silica surfaces in accordance with other recent reports.
Likely, using substrates of stronger surface–CBZ interaction
might allow changing this behavior as in the case of CBZ on top of
crystalline iminostilbene templates.46 As
a preferred crystal orientation results in specific facets being in
contact with the dissolution medium, this might be used to reach a
desired drug release profile.

Conclusion
Having only nine samples
prepared, the screening using solvent
vapor annealing experiments is very effective in the finding of polymorphs.
Here we found four different anhydrous forms of the five CBZ forms
known, hydrate formation, and even a solvate. The finding in this
work suggests that by using SVA processes an understanding in the
polymorphic landscape of a given material can be established quickly
and with a very small set of samples. While the deconvolution of the
crystal morphology, polymorphic form, and texture might remain difficult,
especially for this complex set of samples containing CBZ, possible
routes for a much faster drug release can already be identified using
information from this approach.

Experimental Methods
Carbamazepine (CBZ) was purchased from AGFA Pharma and used without
further treatment. Acetronitrile (AN), 96% ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol
(IPA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and xylene were purchased from different
suppliers in spectroscopic grade and used as received. Solutions of
carbamazepine were prepared in THF and stirred prior to usage. Polished
silicon wafers with a native silicon oxide layer (silica) were purchased
from Siegert Wafers (Germany) and cut into 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 pieces. Prior to usage, the substrates were cleaned in acetone and
ethanol and finally rinsed with Milli-Q water.

Sample preparation
was performed in a two-step process. First,
samples were spin coated onto a piece of silicon wafer (see Figure 6a). For this, a drop
of approximately 100 μL of CBZ solution was placed onto the
substrate followed by a continuous sample rotation around its surface
normal at a rotation speed of 17 rps for 30 s. This results in the
formation of a dry, homogeneous, and amorphous drug layer, as confirmed
by X-ray diffraction experiments. Subsequently, selected samples were
kept under ambient conditions and others at 50 or 80 °C for 48
h. Another set of samples was exposed to vapors of different chemical
composition (see Figure 6b), typically referred to as solvent vapor annealing (SVA). In this,
the amorphous samples are enclosed in a desiccator together with an
excess amount of solvent. As the solvent vessel is not sealed against
the sample, a saturated vapor develops within the desiccator which
then interacts with the sample. For our purpose, all vapors are formed
at ambient conditions (∼1 atm, 22 °C) and either consist
of AN, EtOH, IPA, THF, or xylene, respectively. Each sample was exposed
to just one solvent vapor. After 48 h the respective sample was stored
at ambient conditions until further experiments were performed.

preparation, depicting the preparation of amorphous
carbamazepine films (a) and the subsequent solvent vapor annealing
step (b) transferring the films to the crystalline state.

Morphological investigations were performed on
an Olympus BX51
microscope equipped with polarizers, and images were taken with a
standard digital camera in reflection mode. Crystallographic information
was obtained by X-ray diffraction under nearly grazing incidence conditions
(GIXD), where also thin layers as used in this study provide sufficient
diffraction signal to obtain structural information (using standard
θ/2θ scans, such samples provide only little or even no
diffracted intensities due to small diffraction volumes).35 The measurements were performed at the XRD1
beamline47 at the Elettra synchrotron,
Trieste (Italy). Data were collected for a wavelength of 1.4 Å
using a Pilatus-2 M detector from DECTRIS (Switzerland) by integrating
for 2 min. Data acquisition took place while rotating the sample around
the axes perpendicular to the film surface by 90° while maintaining
constant grazing conditions to improve counting statistics. Due do
the detector construction, detector gaps exits so that two images
per sample needed to be recorded; the second image was taken at slightly
elevated detector position. During data processing using the in-house
developed software GIDVis, data from these images are merged and transferred
from pixel space to reciprocal space using standard procedures.35,36 To identify the individual polymorphs, diffracted intensity data
were integrated along constant q values (∼1/d-spacing), yielding a graphical representation analogous
to classic powder patterns. The data are compared to the calculated
powder patterns of polymorphs with fully known crystal structures
(Cambridge crystal structure database identifier: CBMZPN03, 11, 12,
14 and 16)32 using the software packages
Mercury,48 PowderCell,49 and GIDVis.

In vitro dissolution
testing was performed in
20 mL of Milli-Q water. As the amount of CBZ on each surface was low,
standard dissolution apparatuses like an USP Apparatus 2 are improper.
As only relative differences are of interest, a custom-made setup
was used as introduced previously.25,26 For this,
a sample was placed in a glass container filled with the dissolution
media and gently shaken at 100 rpm at room temperature. An amount
of 1 mL of the dissolution media was withdrawn at predetermined times
for UV–vis absorption measurements using a NanoPhotometer from
Implen Gmbh, Germany, and fed back after measurement leaving the dissolution
medium volume constant over the run of the experiment. The dissolved
CBZ amount was determined at 211 nm using standard Quartz cuvettes.
Each data point is an arithmetic mean of three identical samples/measurements.
Error bars are omitted for sake of clarity.
