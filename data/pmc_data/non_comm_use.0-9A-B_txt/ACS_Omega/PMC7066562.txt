A spectrophotometric
technique has been applied for studying the
reduction of chromium(VI) by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as water-soluble
and nontoxic synthetic polymer at a constant ionic strength of 4.0
mol dm–3 in the absence and presence of the ruthenium(III)
catalyst. In the absence of the catalyst, the reaction orders in [Cr(VI)]
and [PEG] were found to be unity and fractional first orders, respectively.
The oxidation process was found to be acid-catalyzed with fractional
second order in [H+]. The addition of Ru(III) was found
to catalyze the oxidation rates with observation of zero-order reaction
in [CrO42–] and fractional orders in
both [PEG] and [Ru(III)], respectively. The PEG reduces the soluble
toxic hexavalent Cr(VI) as a model pollutant to the insoluble nontoxic
Cr(III) complex, which is known to be eco-friendly and more safer
from the environmental points of view. The acid derivative of PEG
was found to possess high affinity for the removal of poisonous heavy
metal ions from contaminant matters by chelation. Formation of the
1:1 intermediate complex has been kinetically revealed. A consistent
reaction mechanism of oxidation was postulated and discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) has commercial potentiality in a variety
of fields such as biology, biomedical science, surface chemistry,
and electrochemistry. This fact may be attributed to its unique properties
such as chain flexibility, biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, inert
nature to most of biological molecules, and the basicity of the involved
ether-oxygen into the main chain.1,2 Again, the
PEG substrate and its derivatives have extensive applications in the
synthesis of peptides of polymeric drugs,1,3 as
carriers in polyamides4−7 and antistatic agents.8 It also used
to improve the activity of the enzyme-metal ion,9−11 blood substitution,12 and blood circulation13 as well as a surface modifying agent of transition metal aluminides14 and for stabilization of water based on epoxy
formulations.15 These advantages may be
explained by the high hydrophilicity, no antigenicity, nontoxicity,
and low cost of PEG along with the other mentioned properties.

Chemists and biochemists have paid much attention to the chemistry
of chromium(VI) in the biological systems owing to its suspected carcinogen
and mutagen symptoms caused by the high toxicity of this metal ion
oxidant.16,17 The valences of chromium ions are ranging
from +2 to +6 oxidation states. The toxic soluble chromium(VI) and
nontoxic insoluble Cr(III) forms are the more stable oxidation states
of chromium metal ion species. The latter being the more significantly
safer and environmentally friendly.

Chromium(VI) is a labile
oxyanion oxidant that existed in various
forms such as hydro chromate (HCrO4–),
chromate (CrO42–), or dichromate (Cr2O72–), depending on the pH of
the solvent media. The flexibility to elucidate a variety of oxidation
mechanisms in oxidation–reduction reactions containing Cr(VI)
as an oxidant makes the respective redox system studies as a tool
for the evidence of the chemical kinetics.

Although much attention
has been focused by numerous investigators18−30 on the oxidation of organic alcohols by chromic acid, a few publications
were reported on the oxidation of alcoholic macromolecules for either
natural31−34 or synthetic polymers35 by this oxidant.
This fact may be explained by the kinetic complexity arisen from the
existence of either CrV or CrIV species as transient
species formed during the reaction progression together with formation
of Cr(III), which has a high affinity for chelation with the oxidation
products to form a variety of insoluble complexes.29,30 However, the oxidation kinetics of PVA as a synthetic polymer by
chromic acid has been studied in more details in acidic media;35 the natures of electron-transfer process and
the transition states in the rate-determining steps still remain ambiguous
and not complete.

In view of the above arguments and our interest
on the oxidation
kinetics of some alcoholic macromolecules using various oxidants in
acidic media,32−35 the cited redox reaction seems to be of great significance to gain
more knowledge on the role of the nature of both the reducing agent
and the type of solvent on the kinetics and mechanistics of oxidation.
Again, it is of interest to compensate the lack of information on
the mechanism of the electron-transfer process whether of successive
one-electron transfer in a sequence or of simultaneous two-electron
changes in a single step as well as the nature of transition states
in the rate-determining steps. Furthermore, this research work aims
to present a simple method for the remediation of wastewater by eliminating
the soluble carcinogenic Cr(VI) through the transformation of such
species to the insoluble Cr(III) form together with synthesis of a
low-cost coordination polymer oxidation product of the acid-PEG derivative
as a new chelating agent. This method can be used for remediation
of wastewater from simultaneous contaminated carcinogenic Cr(VI) and
toxic heavy metal ions.

2 Results
2.1 Stoichiometry
The reaction stoichiometry
was determined at constants of [H+] and ionic strength
as described elsewhere.31−35 A stoichiometric ratio of 1.3 ± 0.1 mole for the ([Cr(VI)]consumed/[PEG]0) has been obtained after the reaction
completion of the tested experimental runs. This result is corresponding
to the following reaction stoichiometry 1  where H–(O–CH2–CH2)n–O–CH2–CH2OH corresponds to PEG, and H–(O–CH2–CH2)n–O–CH2COOH represents its acid derivative. The identification analyses
were performed as described elsewhere36 The FTIR spectra (Figure 1) confirms the oxidation of the primary OH groups to the corresponding
carboxylic acid of OCO at about 1640 (γas), an OCO
of about 1420 (γs), and the observed broad peak at
about 3504 cm–1 corresponds to the stretching vibration
of O–H (γOH), respectively.

its acid derivative of PEG.

2.2 Influence of [CrO42–] and [PEG] on the Reaction Rates
The good linearity obtained
from ln(absorbance) versus time plots for more than 87% of reaction
completion as well as the independence of the oxidation rates on the
Cr(VI) concentration in the range of 3–9 × 10–4 mol dm–3 may confirm the unity order in [Cr(VI)].
The slopes obtained from such linear plots are corresponding to the
observed pseudo first-order rate constants, (kobs). The calculated values of kobs using the method of least-squares are summarized in Table 1. Again, the fractional first-order
kinetics in [PEG] was revealed from the nonconstancy obtained by dividing
the (kobs/[PEG]0) at fixed
[CrO42–], which confirmed by the equation
(kobs = [PEG]n). Moreover, such observed linearity along the positive intercept
obtained from the plots of the reciprocals of the observed rate constants kobs versus [PEG] (Figure 2) may indicate the obedience of the oxidation
reaction to the Michaelis–Menten kinetics for the formation
of 1:1 intermediate complexes.

Some experimental runs were performed
using the dichromate ion
(Cr2O72 +) oxidant to examine
the influence of variation of the oxidant conformation on the reaction
kinetics. The values of rate constant obtained from the two forms
of chromium(VI) were found to be very nearly similar (1.53 ×
10–4 s–1 in the case of CrO42– and 1.46 × 10–4 s–1 in the case of Cr2O72–, respectively), indicating that the Cr(VI)
species is the sole reactive species in the oxidation processes in
both two cases.

2.3 Influence of [H+] on the Reaction
Rates
Different initial concentrations of HClO4 acid were used at constants of ionic strength (using NaClO4) and other reagents to examine the influence of the [H+] ion on the rates of oxidation. Increasing the acid concentration
was found to be accompanied by an increase in the reaction rates,
indicating that the oxidation process was of an acid-catalyzed nature.
This result was based on the transformation of the oxyanion (CrO42–) of the tetrahedral structure to the
hydrated cation (Cr(H2O)63+) of the
octahedral configuration that needs some H+ ions to be
consumed in this transformation.37 Both
HCl and H2SO4 acids were used to examine the
influence of nature of the anions of the acid on the oxidation rates.
The oxidation rates obtained were found to increase in the order HCl
< HClO4 < H2SO4 with the values
of 1.53, 0.12, and 0.03 × 10–4 s–1, respectively, at 20 °C. This result means that the anion of
the acid plays a remarkable role in the oxidation process. It is well
known that both SO42– and Cl– anions have high tendency to form complexes,38 whereas the ClO4– anion is
known to be extremely inert. Therefore, it may be possible that the
use of SO42– and Cl– anion species tend to form some intermediate complexes prior to
the rate-determining steps, and hence, these complexes will lead to
retard the oxidation processes rather than that in the case of an
inert ClO4– anion.

2.4 Influence of Ionic Strength on the Reaction
Rates
The effect of variation of the ionic strength on the
reaction rates was found to be of great significant to shed some light
on the reactive species in the rate-determining step. Therefore, some
kinetic runs were performed at constant [H+] = 3.0 mol
dm–3 as NaClO4 concentration was increased
to 5.0 mol dm–3. The values of kobs were found to increase with increasing the ionic strength.
A plot of ln kobs against I0.5 gave a good straight line with a positive slope as
shown in Figure 3.
However, the ionic strength used was deviated from that needed by
the above Debye–Hückel equation; the ionic strength
dependence was qualitatively as expected when considering the charges
involved.39

strength dependence of the observed first-order
rate constant. [CrO42–] = 7.0 ×
10–4, [PEG] = 1.3 × 10–1,
[H+] = 3.0 mol dm–3 at 20 °C.

2.5 Test of Free-Radical Intervention
The negative test of added 10% (v/v) acrylonitrile to the reaction
mixture was found to be surprising and contrary to our expectations.
Therefore, to confirm the absence or presence of such free radicals,
both the ESR technique and mercuric chloride (HgCl2) reagent
were also examined to ascertain such testing. These latter two tests
indicated that no precipitate was formed confirming the absence of
such free-radicals intervention.

2.6 Influence
of [Mn2+] Ions on the
Reaction Rates
Much debate has been recognized in the past18 with respect to the involvement of chromium(IV)
as an intermediate in redox reactions involving chromium(VI) as an
oxidant. It is well known that manganese(II) has high affinity for
trapping the Cr(IV) intermediate. The estimated redox potentials of
CrVI/CrIII (E° = 1.33
V) and MnIII/MnII (E°
= 1. 51 V) couples indicate that the oxidation of MnII by
CrVI is thermodynamically unfavorable.40,41 Hence, the influence of Mn2+ added to the reaction mixtures
on the values of the oxidation rates may confirm the involvement of
Cr(IV) as an intermediate during the reaction progression. This is
attributed to the occurrence of the following reaction 2  

The occurrence of such
above reaction should lead to a decrease in the reaction rates as
was experimentally observed.

Most reports of the oxidation of
organic substrates by Cr(VI) were
found to exhibit such behavior of decreasing the oxidation rates on
the addition of the Mn(II) ion.42,43 The oxidation strength
of the formed Mn(III) of the protonated substrates as a competitor
oxidant is negligibly small compared to that of chromic acid owing
to the rapid disproportionation of Mn(III) under our experimental
conditions of [H+] used.44

Therefore, the involvement of Cr(IV) as an intermediate during
the reaction progression has been examined by adding manganous ions19,45,46 to the reaction mixtures in the
present work. The added salts showed a gradual decrease in the reaction
rates with increasing the added Mn+2 ions as shown in Table 1.

2.7 Influence of [Ru(III)] Catalyst on the Reaction
Rates
The oxidation rates were found to be accelerated by
the addition of the Ru(III) catalyst to the reaction mixtures. The
experimental results revealed zero order in [CrO42–] and fractional orders in both [PEG] and [Ru(III)], respectively,
in the case of presence of the Ru(III) catalyst. The results are listed
in Table 1.

3 Discussions
In general, two reaction mechanisms for
the electron-transfer process
in redox reactions involving chromium(VI) as an oxidant are usually
suggested. The first mechanism corresponds to simultaneous transfer
of two electrons in a single step as CrVI → CrIV → CrII. The second one represents to the
transfer of successive one-electron transfer in the sequence as CrVI → CrV → CrIV →
CrIII. Hence, those two mechanisms may be considered for
the oxidation of PEG by Cr(VI) with formation of either CrV and/or CrIV intermediate species19,45,46 The decrease in the rates of oxidation on
the addition of the Mn2+ ion to the reaction mixtures may
be considered as an indirect evidence for involvement of chromium(IV)
as an intermediate species rather than that of chromium(V) species
during the progress of such present redox reaction.42,43

Under our experimental conditions of [H+] used,
the
observed non-integral second-order dependence in [H+] is
reasonable when taking the protolytic equilibrium constant (K) values for Cr(VI) into consideration45,47,48 as well as that the quantity of formation
of the chromium dimer is negligibly small. This means that chromic
acid can be assumed to be the main reactive species of the chromium
ion, which confirmed by the calculated quantity of the formed H2CrO4 using the values of K(45,47,48) (80–95% of [Cr(VI)]T).

In terms of the above arguments and the experimental
observations
of hydrogen ion concentration dependence of the oxidation rates, a
plausible reaction mechanism consistent with the observed kinetic
results may be postulated. In such mechanism, both the oxidant and
substrate tend for protonation at the [H+] used.19 The protonation of the two reactant substrates
can be expressed by the following protolytic equilibria 3   4  Here S and SH+ correspond
to the PEG substrate and its protonated form. On the other hand, K1 and K are the protonation
constants of chromic acid and PEG reactants, respectively. This protonation
was followed by the fast attack of chromic acid on the protonated
PEG reductant giving the intermediate complex (C1) depending
on the nature of the formed intermediates as defined by eq 5 5  The intermediate
(C1) is slowly decomposed in the rate-determining step
giving the corresponding
aldehyde substrate with formation of Cr(IV) and/or Cr(IV) (red) as
initial oxidation products as follows 6  where the symbols S represents
the nonfree-radical aldehyde substrate. Hence, the aldehyde substrate
formed is rapidly oxidized by two reaction pathways. This means that
the oxidation occurs by either picking up of a further new oxidant
molecule or by one of the formed Cr(IV) and/or Cr(V) transient species
to give rise to the final oxidation products as described by eqs 7 and 8, respectively, 7   8  

The rate-law expression,
which corresponds to the change of the
rate constant with changing both the [H+] and PEG substrate
concentrations, can be written as follows 9  When [PEG]0 >
>
[Ox]0 and rearrangement, one concludes that 10  where [PEG]T is
the analytical total concentration of the PEG substrate.

The
rate expression defined by eq 10 requires that plots of 1/kobs versus either 1/[PEG] at constant [H+] or 1/[H+]2 at constant [PEG] to be linear with positive intercepts
on 1/kobs axes as was experimentally observed.
In view of the small negligible intercept observed in (Figure 2) and rearrangement, eq 10 can be reduced to
the following simple form 11  where the apparent
rate constants ka′ and
ka″ equal to kaKK1K2 and kaK1K2, respectively. Plots of [H+][PEG]T/kobs versus
1/[H+] of eq 11 were linear with positive
intercepts on the [H+][PEG]T/kobs axis (Figure 4) from those slopes and intercepts, the values of the apparent
rate constants, k’a and k″a, and the protonation constants (K) of the PEG substrate can be evaluated.

various temperatures. [CrO42–] = 7.0
× 10–4, [PEG] =1.3 × 10–1, and I = 4.0 mol dm–3.

The calculated values of ka’ and ka″ by the
method of least-squares are listed in Table 2. The values of protonation constants (K) were found to be in good agreement and with the same
order of magnitude to that reported previously for oxidation of poly(vinyl
alcohol) as synthetic alcoholic polymer by this oxidant.31 This result may be considered as indicative
evidence to support the suggested mechanism.

The non-availability
of the formation constants (K2) at different
temperatures makes it difficult to evaluate
the values of the rate constants of the elementary reaction ka. Therefore, the listed apparent
rate constants are composite quantities of the rate, protonation,
and the formation constants. Arrhenius and Eyring equations were applied
to evaluate the activation parameters of the (ka’ and ka″) and second-order rate constant (kn). The calculated values of those rate constants
using the least-square method along with those thermodynamic values
for protonation of PEG are summarized in Table 3.

rate constant measured
at [H+] = 4.0 mol dm–3.

The observed negative value of ΔH°
indicates that the protonation of the PEG substrate is of an exothermic
nature. On the other hand, the large positive values for ΔG≠ may confirm the nonspontaneity of the
complex formation prior to the rate-determining steps, that is, the
activated complexes could be more ordered and more compactness than
that of the reactants. This suggestion was supported by the observed
large negative values of entropies of activations (ΔS≠).

The observed small activation
energy value, Ea≠ (Table 3), means that the
reactants to overcome the transition
state or form the intermediate complexes do not need much energy for
such purposes.

Generally, the values of activation entropies,
ΔS≠, for redox reactions
of innersphere nature were
reported to be of negative signs, whereas that of positive ΔS≠ values were usually refer to redox
reactions of outersphere mechanisms.45−50 Consequently, the observed negatively ΔS≠ values in Table 3 may indicate the predomination of the innersphere
mechanism than that of the outersphere type for reduction of chromic
acid by the PEG substrate.

Moreover, the small differences observed
between the two rates
of oxidation on using CrO42– and Cr2O72– species may be interpreted
by the large steric hindrance faced the attack of Cr2O72– species of a large size on the protonated
substrate of PEG to form the complex (C1) compared to that
of small size CrO42– species. Moreover,
the great similarity in the magnitude of the values of the rate constant
using those two oxidants (Cr2O72– and CrO42–) may indicate that the reactive
species in both cases are the Cr(VI) ion.

In general, the reaction
mechanism of the present work may suggest
the existence of three pathway routes for reduction of the chromium(VI)
ion by PEG in the case of the absence of the Ru(III) catalyst as shown
in Scheme 1A–C.
The experimental results and data interpretations may suggest to neglect
the pathway (B) since it involves the intervention of the free-radical
mechanism, and the reaction was of unity order in [H+].
Again, reaction pathway (B) can be also excluded since it was based
on the intervention of the free-radical mechanism.

Scheme 1 Speculated Mechanism
of Reduction of Potassium Chromate by Poly(ethylene
glycol) in Aqueous Perchlorate Solutions
Consequently, the reaction pathway (A) of the nonfree radical intervention
may be suggested as the more probable one for reduction of chromium(VI)
by poly(ethylene glycol). This suggestion can be confirmed by the
observed results of the second-order reaction in [H+] and
the formation of Cr(IV) but not Cr(V) as an initial oxidation product
(based on the results of the added Mn2+ ions). Furthermore,
the kinetic results obtained from the ionic strength dependence of
the reaction rates may support a reaction mechanism of two-electron
changes of innersphere nature based on the signs of the reactive species
in the rate-slow step together with the fact that it does not appear
any report of the two-electron-transfer process of the outersphere
nature up until now.49,50

Furthermore, the kinetics
of the present redox reaction has been
study in presence of Ru(III) to examine the effect of such a catalyst
on the kinetics and mechanistic of the present oxidation–reduction
reaction. Ruthenium(III) has been widely used as a catalyst51,52 in many other redox reactions that involving one or two equivalent
oxidants in acidic or in alkaline solutions; It found that the addition
of Ru(III) to the present reaction mixture was accompanied by an increase
in the oxidation rates with first-order kinetics in both the catalyst
and hydrogen ion concentrations, whereas zero order with respect to
the [oxidant] was observed. This result indicates that the Ru(III)
catalyst is first reacted with the chromic acid oxidant to form the
intermediate complex (C2). Then, the formed complex (C2) reacts with the PEG to give a further intermediate complex
(C3) with subtraction of a proton by a water molecule prior
to the rate-determining step, followed by the transfer of electrons
from the PEG substrate to the chromic acid in the rate-determining
step to give the substrate (C̀3) and the reduced
form of the oxidant as initial oxidation products as follows 12   13  

Then, the substrate radical is rapidly decomposed
giving the final
oxidation product 14  

In a similar manner to that applied for derivation of the
rate-law
expression of the former mechanism the rate-law for the changing of
the reactants concentration can be expressed by 15  where [S]T is
the analytical total concentration of the PEG and
equals ([S]T = [S] +
[SH+] + [C3]). Consequently, eq 15 on rearrangement yields 16  where 

According to eq 16, a plot of the reciprocals of the observed rate constants (1/k′obs) against 1/ [Ru(III)] should be
straight line with positive intercepts on the 1/k′obs axis as was experimentally observed. A typical
plot is shown in Figure 5.

4 Conclusions
A conventional spectrophotometric technique has been applied for
studying the reduction of Cr(VI) by PEG as a synthetic polymer at
a constant ionic strength of 4.0 mol dm–3 in the
absence and presence of the Ru(III) catalyst. In the absence of the
Ru(III) catalyst, a unity order in [Cr(VI)] and fractional first-order
kinetics in [PEG] were observed. The [H+] dependence of
the rate-constants indicated that the oxidation process was of acid-catalyzed
nature with fractional second–order kinetics in [H+]. Adding the Ru(III) catalyst to the reaction mixtures was found
to catalyze the oxidation process with results of zero-order reaction
in [CrO42–] and fractional first-order
reactions in both [PEG] and [Ru (II)], respectively. The PEG reduces
the soluble carcinogenic Cr(VI) to nontoxic insoluble Cr(III), whereas
the oxidation product of PEG tends to remove the toxic polyvalent
metal ions may present in the solvent media by chelation. The kinetic
parameters were evaluated, and a suitable reaction mechanism for the
oxidation process in terms of two-electron transfer of an inner-sphere
nature was suggested and discussed.

Section
5.1 Materials and Preparations
Poly(ethylene
glycol) 6000 (Merck KGA, 64271 Darmstadt, Germany) was used without
further purification. Solution of PEG was prepared by adding the requisite
amount of reagent powder to doubly distilled water. All other reagents
were prepared and analyzed as described earlier.31−35 Sodium perchlorate as an inert electrolyte was used
to adjust the ionic strength.

5.2 Kinetic
Measurements
The kinetic
measurements were conducted under pseudo-first-order conditions where
polyethylene glycol (PEG) was present in a large excess over that
of the oxidant’s concentration [CrO42–]. The course of reaction was followed by recording the decrease
in absorbance of chromic acid at its absorption maximum, 350 nm, as
a function of time as described elsewhere.31,53,54 It found that no interference from the reagents
or the products occurred at this wavelength during the experimental
measurements.

oxidation reaction are shown in Figure 6.

Appendix (I)
Under the cited experimental
conditions of the [H+]
used, both reactants have high tendency for protonation in aqueous
acidic media forming the corresponding reactive protonated forms as
follows 3   4  Then, the redox reaction takes
place by attacking the chromic acid oxidant on the protonated PEG
(SH+) forming an intermediate complex (C1) prior
to the rate-determining step with releasing a water molecule as follows 5  Then, a slow decomposition
of the formed complex (C1) occurs in slow step giving (C̀)
and (red) as initial oxidation products.  Considering the analytical total
concentration
of PEG [S]T defined by eq i i  

The concentration of
PEG can be evaluated by the following equation, ii  Since the general rate-law
equation of the present redox reaction is expressed by eq iii iii  Then, the change of the
rate constant with changing the [H+] and [PEG] can be expressed
by the following equation  

Under the
pseudo-first-order conditions of [PEG]0 ≥
[CrVI], the rate-law expression is usually expressed by
the formula, iv  Comparing both eqs iv and 9, one concludes that v  Rearrangement of eq v yields 10  The small intercept observed
in Figure 2 leads to
neglecting the term  in eq 10 to give
the following simple relationship 11  where ka` = kaKK1K2 and ka″ = kaK1K2.
