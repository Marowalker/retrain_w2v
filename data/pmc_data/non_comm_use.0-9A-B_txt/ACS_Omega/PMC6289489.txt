In this study, novel adsorbent ceria
nanoparticles (CeNPs) entrapped in tamarind powder (Tm@CeNPs) were
efficiently utilized for the simultaneous adsorption of aqueous mercury
[Hg(II)] and aqueous lead [Pb(II)]. Surface interactions between the
adsorbent and heavy metal ions play an important role in the adsorption
process, and the surface morphology can significantly improve the
adsorption capacity of the adsorbent. The Langmuir adsorption capacity
of Tm@CeNPs for Hg(II) and Pb(II) was found to be 200 and 142.85 mg/g,
respectively. The surface area of utilized adsorbent was found to
be very high, that is, 412 m2/g. The adsorption kinetics
of Tm@CeNPs for both ions follow pseudo-second-order, and the adsorption
process is also thermodynamically feasible. Column study favors multilayer
adsorption of the heavy metal ion. The spectral analysis of the adsorbent
revealed that hydroxyl, carboxylic, and ester groups, as well as CeNPs,
are responsible for Hg(II) and Pb(II) adsorption. The cost-benefit
analysis confirms the economic viability of the synthesized Tm@CeNPs
composite for heavy metal removal. The adsorbent is best suited for
Hg(II) adsorption as compared to Pb(II). This is a novel study on
the utilization of tamarind leaf powder with CeNPs for heavy metal
ion adsorption and its adsorption mechanism, which has not been reported
to date.

==== Body
1 Introduction
With
the boom of industries particularly printing, pigment manufacturing,
mining, and battery manufacturing industries, the amount of anthropogenic
waste emission into the water has been increased too.1 Presently, the world is facing a severe problem of heavy
metal contamination in water, which affects both plants and animals.2 Accumulation of these toxic heavy metal ions
(i.e., Hg, Pb, Cd, Cr, and As) in the environment leads to critical
health problems. Various industries such as lead battery, phosphate
fertilizer, electronics, wood, and automobile industries release their
effluents which contain Pb(II) into the water, and in the last few
decades, Pb(II) is regarded as the major source of heavy metal contamination
throughout the world. The most toxic heavy metal (i.e., mercury) has
the potential to accumulate in the living tissue and to biomagnify
in food chains. These heavy metal ions such as mercury [Hg(II)] and
lead [Pb(II)] can cause various health issues, namely gastrointestinal
diseases, liver problems, and nervous system damage. Therefore, the
World Health Organization (WHO) has enforced the concentration limit
for Pb(II) and Hg(II) in drinking water as below 0.01 and 0.001 ppm,
respectively.3,4 The removal of heavy metal ions
has evoked considerable interest for decades. Many conventional methods
for the removal of these toxic metals such as chemical precipitation,5 electrolysis,6 ion
exchange,7 and adsorption8 have been reported. However, these techniques have limitations
and are either not effective or economically viable for the heavy
metal ion removal at low concentrations. Among them, adsorption and
ion exchange is simple and cost-effective as compared to other techniques.9,10

The utilization of low-cost adsorbent materials and the effective
reduction of heavy metal ion concentration of water are the major
advantages of the adsorption technology. It is more advantageous over
conventional methods in terms of minimization of biological and/or
chemical sludge, high efficiency, low cost, the possibility of metal
recovery, and the regeneration of adsorbent. Being cost-effective,
the adsorption technology is widely used in heavy metal industries.
Many adsorbents have been utilized for heavy metal ion removal from
the water, that is, hazelnut shells,11 peanut
hull,12 coconut husk,13 modified cellulosic materials,14 modified corncobs,15 rice hulls,16 nanosize metal oxides,17,18 activated carbons,19 biomaterials,20 and polymers,21 such
as poly(2-aminothiazole)22 and poly(1-amino-5-chloroanthraquinone)
nanofibrils.23 These materials have some
drawbacks such as pore size distribution of adsorbent, and they are
nonspecific.

Biosorption is a very advantageous technique for
heavy metal removal from water because it reduces the biological and/or
chemical sludge, does not require nutrients, and has high efficiency
in detoxifying effluents. It also offers reversible and fast uptake
of the heavy metals with biomass or micro-organisms. In the last 2
decades, lots of biological (low-cost) adsorbents have been examined
for the removal of toxic metal ions from the aqueous medium. Biosorbents
are by-products that are obtained from biomaterial production, and
hence they are very cheap also.

The leaves of tamarind can be
acquired at a low cost and considered as a waste product.24 The leaves possess flavonoids, pectin, water-soluble
carbohydrates, tartaric acid, and phenols. These leaves are also used
in various food items, that is, soups, stews, salads, and curries
in various countries.25 Almost all chemical
studies on tamarind leaves emphasize on their edibility and the presence
of flavonoid compounds. Triterpenoids, lupanone, and lupeol are the
other classes of compounds reported from the tamarind leaves, and
some essential oils with benzyl benzoate and limonene were also reported
as major compounds.26 Leaves and fruit
of the tamarind tree contain a large amount of natural tartaric acid
ranging from 8 to 18%.27−29

Literature survey reveals that tamarind is
a calcium-rich plant material; Ca(II) ion has high coordination numbers
up to 24 and also has a large size and surface area, which is responsible
for the high metal uptake efficiency. Additionally, tamarind leaves
have several organic moieties with diverse functional groups which
are responsible for the heavy metal uptake such as tartaric acid,
flavonoid, triterpenoids, lupanone, lupeol, benzyl benzoate, limonene,
diphenyl-ether, ketones, and so forth, and among them, tartaric acid
is a major constituent. Therefore, −COOH group of tartaric
acid plays a major role in the adsorption mechanism. Additionally,
we have studied the chemical constituents of some other leaves of
local plants, that is, Luffa cylindrica, Mentha arvensis, Syzygium cumini, and Azadirachta indica with a comparison to Tamarindus indica leaves (Figure S1 and Table S1). Hereafter, this study confirmed that T. indica has a larger number of constituent elements
and high abundance of acidic functional groups (Table S1). Therefore, tamarind leaf powder could be successfully
utilized as a low-cost alternative biomaterial to prepare tamarind-based
adsorbent for the removal of aqueous metal toxicants.

The surface
area plays a key role in the efficient adsorption; thus, with this
objective, we have synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeNPs)
entrapped in the tamarind leaf powder. To augment the surface area
of tamarind powder, CeNPs were entrapped, and this enhances the surface
area of tamarind powder from 115 to 412 m2/g, as we desired.

From the literature review, there is no elucidation of the mechanism
for heavy metal adsorption on tamarind-based adsorbents, that is,
bark, fruit shell, and so forth, as well as there is no report on
tamarind leaves for adsorption of the heavy metal ion. This is the
first time exploration of the adsorption mechanism using tamarind-based
adsorbent with the incorporation of CeNPs. The beauty of the present
adsorbent is its exceptionally high surface area, that is, 412 m2/g as well as selectivity toward Hg(II) and Pb(II) with good
adsorption capacity, that is, 200 and 142.85 mg/g, respectively. The
equilibrium adsorption, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies have been
carried out for a better consideration of the adsorption process.

The pretreatment of tamarind leaves was carried out at very mild
conditions to increase the metal uptake efficiency. We have used fresh
tamarind leaves for the synthesis of adsorbent because in fresh tamarind
leaves the abundance of functional groups moieties and chemical constituents
are more than defoliated leaves.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Adsorbent Dose
In the adsorption process, the adsorbent dose plays an important
role because it determines the % A for a given initial
concentration of metal ion (Ci) solution.
The adsorbent dose was varied from 0.1 to 0.5 g at fixed Hg(II) and
Pb(II) concentration of 10 ppb. Figure 1a,b shows the effect of adsorbent dose on % A and distribution coefficient kd. The % A increase with an increase in adsorbent
dose up to 0.3 g, after that it reaches an equilibrium. After 0.4
g adsorbent dose, the increase in % A was very slow
or no increase. The % A for Hg(II) and Pb(II) was
found to be 97 and 81% at 0.3 g adsorbent dose, on further increase
in adsorbent dose, % A increases from 97 to 98.2%
for Hg(II) and 81 to 92% for Pb(II). From these results, it is confirmed
with increase in adsorbent dose, % A increases up
to a certain level; this might be due to a corresponding increase
in the binding active sites. However, after a certain level with a
further increase in dose, % A did not increase; this
is because the concentration of adsorbing ion may get reduced or may
be saturated on the adsorbent sites. Additionally, large amount of
adsorbent dose led to greater contact between the adsorbent particles
on Tm@CeNPs surface and the adsorbing ions. Hence, the adsorption
of Hg(II) ions on adsorption sites will be high. However, the dose
of 0.4 g of adsorbent showed equilibrium for the adsorption of Hg(II)
because there was no adsorption observed above 0.4 g of adsorbent
dose. Hence, use of more doses will only lead to wastage of adsorbent.
Furthermore, the distribution coefficient curves show the first decrease
and then increase in the kd value which
signifies the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent.

Figure 1 Effect of adsorbent dose
for adsorption of (a) Hg(II) and (b) Pb(II) on Tm@CeNPs.

From the overall study of adsorbent dose, the adsorption
of Hg(II) occurred prior to that of Pb(II).

2.2 Effect
of pH
The % A of both the metal ion increases
up to pH 6 for Pb(II) and pH 7 for Hg(II), after which the % A decreases. The charge of the surface of cerium oxide became
negative on increasing the pH because of the increasing deprotonation
reaction, which strongly weakened the electrostatic attraction between
the metal ion and the negatively charged surface. The surface charge
of the adsorbent was positive pH < 7 and negative pH > 7.

Pb(II) and Pb(OH)+ were found as dominant species of Pb(II)
at pH < 6.2 (Figure 2a). The CeNPs could react with Pb(II) and Pb(OH)+ to form
CeO–PbOH and Ce2O3–PbO. Consequently,
the Pb(II) adsorption at pH < 6.2 occurred because of the outer-sphere
surface complexation reaction. The comparative dispersal of Pb(II)
species in solution showed that Pb(II) mainly existed in the form
of Pb(OH)+, Pb3(OH)42+, and Pb4(OH)44+ species at pH >
6.2.30,31 Pb(II) is capable to bind cerium oxides
and form inner-sphere complexes through the covalent bonds between
Pb(II) and oxygen on Tm@CeNPs surfaces. Additionally, lead forms precipitate
of Pb(OH)2 at high pH conditions. Therefore, it confirms
that the ease of adsorption of aqueous Pb(II) and Hg(II) driven by
the combined effect of both precipitation and inner-sphere surface
complexation.

cycle, and (d) temperature on adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) on Tm@CeNPs.

2.3 Effect
of Co-Metal Ions and Co-Anions
The interference of co-metal
ions during the adsorption was also studied to confirm the selectivity
of adsorbent toward Hg(II) and Pb(II). For this, an equal concentration
of co-metal ions was added into the Hg(II) and Pb(II) solution during
the adsorption process and analyzed for the residual concentration
of different co-metal ions. The result found that the co-metal ions
concentration remains the same or decreases negligibly. The order
of co-metal ion effect on the adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) was
found to be Co(II) > Ni(II) > Ca(II) > Al(III) > Fe(III)
> Mg(II) and Ni(II) > Co(II) > Al(III) > Fe(III) >
Ca(II) > Mg(II) (Figure 2b), respectively.

Additionally, the effect of co-anions
was also studied, in which the order of % A was found
to be PO43– > SO42– > CO32– > NO3– > Cl– for Hg(II) and Pb(II) (Figure S2). The ratio of charge to the radius
(z/r) of the anions had a close
correlation with their affinity to the adsorbents, and the order of z/r is PO43– (3/0.238) > SO42– (2/0.230) >
CO32– (2/0.186) > NO3– (1/0.179) > Cl– (1/0.181). PO43– and SO42– have higher z/r so they have a
greater affinity toward adsorbent. Cl– and NO3– showed a lesser effect on adsorption,
and this might be due to the low affinity of these ligands.

2.4 Regeneration
For any type of adsorption process, the
reuse or regeneration of adsorbent is very essential from the economy
point of view. Thus, regeneration of adsorbent has been done up to
10 cycles to inspect the reusability of the adsorbent and metal recovery
efficiency.32 The desorption of both metals
Hg(II) and Pb(II) from the Tm@CeNPs surfaces was carried out in 1
mol/L HNO3 solution. The adsorption/desorption results
of 10 cycles are given in Figure 2c, which shows that the adsorbent perpetuates more
than 80% of its original, at the end of the fourth cycle, and adsorption
capacity was slowly reduced after the fifth adsorption/desorption
cycle. This may be probably due to the loss of some functional groups
of the tamarind because of acid cleavage. The results show that the
Tm@CeNPs are frequently reusable and can be utilized extensively in
industrial activities.

2.5 Effect of Temperature
Increase or decrease in temperature during the adsorption process
alters the adsorption capacity of Tm@CeNPs. The % A for Hg(II) and Pb(II) decreases with increase in temperature from
298 to 313 K as shown in Figure 2d, which shows that the % A decreases
by increasing the temperature up to 313 K. This might be due to the
increase in mobility of metal ions, with an increase in temperature.
This increase in mobility decreases the chelation of metal ion with
the adsorbent. Thus, on increasing temperature, the number of metal
ions that can be adsorbed on Tm@CeNPs decreases. Additionally, the
electrostatic interaction between metal ions and Tm@CeNPs becomes
weak at higher temperatures, and the adsorption process is exothermic
in nature.

2.6 Effect of Contact Time
and Kinetic Studies
Figure 3a,b shows the effect of contact time on the adsorption
efficiency of Hg(II) and Pb(II). For fixed mercury and lead ion concentrations,
the experiments were carried out in 5–70 min range of the contact
time. Increasing the contact time increased the removal efficiency
as there was more time available to interact with adsorption sites
on the surfaces of Tm@CeNPs for metal ions. Throughout the first 30
min, the removal efficiency was rapid of Hg(II) and Pb(II), then increased
slowly, and within 50 min the adsorption equilibrium was achieved.
This may be due to the abundance of vacant surface adsorption sites
during the initial stage of adsorption. The remaining vacant surface
adsorption sites were quite less in number with further increase in
contact time. Furthermore, owing to the
repulsive forces functioning between metal ions present in the solution
and the already adsorbed metal ions on the solid and those they were
not occupied.

Figure 3 Effect of contact time (a,b) and initial metal ion concentration
on adsorption (c,d) of Hg(II) and Pb(II) on Tm@CeNPs, respectively.

In order to complete the understanding
of the kinetics of the adsorption process, four different kinetic
models were utilized, that is, pseudo-first-order (PFO) (Figure 4a), pseudo-second-order
(PSO) (Figure 4b),
intraparticle diffusion (IPD) (Figure 4c), and Elovich (Figure 4d). From the R2 analysis
of kinetic models, the PSO model was best fitted for Hg(II) and Pb(II)
adsorption on Tm@CeNPs. The order of R2 analysis for Hg(II) and Pb(II) adsorption was PSO > Elovich >
IPD > PFO and PSO > IPD > Elovich > PFO, respectively.
All three kinetic models well suited the adsorption data of metal
ion adsorption except PFO. These models imply that the adsorption
mechanism was controlled by particle diffusion and electrostatic interactions.
The other kinetic constants of kinetic models are tabulated in Table 1.

Figure 4 Kinetic model for adsorption
of Hg(II) and Pb(II) on Tm@CeNPs (a–d) PFO, PSO, IPD, and Elovich,
respectively.

2.7 Effect of Initial Metal Concentration (Ci) and Adsorption Equilibrium Isotherm
The effect
of Ci on the % A and Qe of Tm@CeNPs for Hg(II) and Pb(II) was examined
by varying the concentration of metal ions from 10 to 100 ppb. Figure 3c,d shows the result
of Ci on adsorption of both metal ions
by Tm@CeNPs. The % A for Hg(II) was subsequently
decreased from 98.6 to 96%. For a fixed amount of adsorbent, the decrease
in the number of Hg(II) ions in the solution on increased concentrations
is due to several ions competing at the binding sites. The decrease
in percent removal is due to the limited total available adsorption
sites. While for Pb(II), % A increases slightly from
91 to 95%.

The equilibrium measurement was performed to examine
the fundamental adsorption properties regarding adsorption capacity
and interaction by using four adsorption models, that is, Freundlich
(Figure 5a), Langmuir
(Figure 5b), D–R
(Figure 5c), and Temkin
(Figure 5d). The explanation
of these models was tabulated in Table 2. From the R2 analysis
of these models, all four models satisfy the adsorption data but the
Freundlich model was a best-fitted model for Hg(II) as well as the
Pb(II) adsorption. The order of R2 value
for Hg(II) is Freundlich ≅ Temkin ≅ D–R >
Langmuir, and for Pb(II), the order is Freundlich ≅ Temkin
> D–R > Langmuir. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated
from the Langmuir constant was found to be 200 mg/g for Hg(II) and
142.85 mg/g for Pb(II). The results further indicate that the Hg(II)
adsorption was more prone to adsorbent as compared to the Pb(II).
The 1/n and KL value
signifies the favorable adsorption between the metal ions and the
adsorbent.

respectively.

R2	0.977	0.975	R2	0.97	0.95	
The qm value obtained
from the D–R model also agrees with Langmuir. The mean free
energy calculated by D–R signifies that the physisorption process
occurs during adsorption. The Temkin constants signify favorable binding
between metal ions and adsorbents. The values for another constant
of the adsorption models are tabulated in Table 2.

2.8 Studies for Selectivity
The synthesized Tm@CeNPs selectively adsorb Hg(II) and Pb(II) metal
ions because these both ions have the more capability to form a covalent
bond with the surface oxygen of Tm@CeNPs, and these two ions also
get precipitated at high pH conditions. The study of the effect of
interfering ions on adsorption also confirms the selectivity of adsorbent
toward Hg(II) and Pb(II). The order of co-metal ion effect on the
adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) metal ions was Co(II) > Ni(II)
> Ca(II) > Al(III) > Fe(III) > Mg(II) and Ni(II) >
Co(II) > Al(III) > Fe(III) > Ca(II) > Mg(II) (Figure 2b), respectively.

The reason behind the selective adsorption of lead and mercury
is its high effective nuclear charge in comparison to above all co-metal
ions because the effective nuclear charge increases ongoing downward
in periodic table due to the involvement of a greater number of d-orbitals.
Hence, lead and mercury show stronger attraction than other co-metal
ions.

3 Thermodynamic Parameters
The thermodynamic
parameters, such as Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy, reveals
the information about the adsorption process. These thermodynamic
parameters have been calculated using the van’t Hoff plot (Figure 6). In this study,
the value of ΔG found negative for both metal
ion adsorption processes, which means that the adsorption of Hg(II)
and Pb(II) was a feasible process. The negative value of ΔH for both the metal ion adsorption reveals that the adsorption
process was exothermic and the positive value of ΔS reveals spontaneity of the process (Table 3).

Figure 6 Linear dependence of ln Ce on 1/T based on the adsorption thermodynamic.

4 Column Studies
To
study the adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) onto Tm@CeNPs, different
linear and nonlinear column models were utilized which are Thomas
(Figure 7a), Yoon–Nelson
(Figure 7b), Yan (Figure 7c), and Clark (Figure 7d) models. KTh (mL/min/mg), KYN (mL/min/mg), and Ky are rate constants
of Thomas, Yoon–Nelson, and Yan models, respectively. qy and qT are the
maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) and the maximum solid-phase concentration
of the solute (mg/g) of adsorbent calculated by Yan and Thomas models,
respectively. The breakthrough (sampling) time is represented as t (min), and the time required for 50% adsorbate breakthrough
(min) is T. The exponent of the Freundlich isotherm
is denoted as n, and A and r are the parameters of the kinetic equation. From the R2 analysis of column models, the Yoon–Nelson
model was best fitted for both the metal ions. The order for Hg(II)
is Yoon–Nelson > Clark > Thomas ≅ Yan and for
Pb(II) is Yoon–Nelson > Clark > Thomas > Yan. Clark
models further prove the multilayer type of adsorption. The column
data match with the adsorption data, both follow the Freundlich model.
The adsorption capacity obtained from the Thomas model was 6450 and
5540 mg/g for Hg(II) and Pb(II), respectively. The other required
constants of column models are recorded in Table 4.

5 Cost Analysis
Cost is a key factor
in the choice of adsorbent used in the industry. The Tm@CeNPs were
synthesized by utilizing the analytical reagent grade chemicals. Presently,
the cost of Tm@CeNPs adsorbent is around US$ 30.79 per kg in the lab.
Additionally, in the future, industrial-grade raw materials will replace
the analytical-grade chemicals for the large-scale synthesis of adsorbent,
which will decrease the cost of adsorbent and increase their application
substantially.

6 Field Study
The
samples of industrial wastewater for the field study experiments were
collected from an industrial area nearby Banasthali Vidyapith to check
the suitability of Tm@CeNPs as the adsorbent (Table S2). The batch study was conducted for the adsorption
of these toxic metals using different doses of Tm@CeNPs (Figure S3). For this study, 3 g of adsorbent
was taken for 1000 mL of industrial wastewater into a beaker. Now,
this solution was shaken at room temperature for 40 min, and then
the concentration of both metal ions and the water quality parameters
were measured, and data are recoded in Table S2. Results demonstrate that all the water quality parameters and the
concentration of Hg(II) and Pb(II) from the treated water are below
than the permissible limit, which is in good agreement with the adsorption
data of batch experiment. Hence, the present study reveals that the
removal of Hg(II) and Pb(II) ions from wastewater using Tm@CeNPs is
also good for the field level.

7 Adsorption Mechanism
The adsorption performance of the Tm@CeNPs may coordinate with Pb(II)
or Hg(II) through carboxyl (−COOH or −COOR), hydroxyl
(−OH), and/or M−π interaction. The adsorption
of heavy metal ion may be due to the electrostatic interaction between
positively charged metal ion and the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups
of tamarind. Additionally, CeNPs also facilitate heavy metal adsorption
by electrostatic interactions and complexation. Figure 8 shows the adsorption mechanism of metal
ions. The comparison of adsorption capacity of Tm@CeNPs with previously
synthesized adsorbents is given in Table 5.

8 Characterization
Figure 9 shows the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of type
IV, and the corresponding pore size distributions are shown in Figure 9a of Tm@CeNPs. The
hysteresis loop (type IV) indicates the presence of both micropores
and mesopores in the composite. The distributions of the pore size,
surface area, and the pore volume for CeNPs, activated tamarind fresh
leaves (ATFL), and Tm@CeNPs are tabulated in Table 6. The BET surface area, pore size, and the
pore volume of the Tm@CeNPs were found to be much higher as compared
to the pure CeNPs and ATFL, which was 412 m2/g, 1.5 nm
and 0.523 cm3/g, respectively, while the surface area of
CeNPs and ATFL was 203 and 115 m2/g, respectively.

8.1 Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy
The surface morphology and elemental composition
of Tm@CeNPs, Tm@CeNPs–Hg(II), and Tm@CeNPs–Pb(II) were
analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)–energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Figure 10a–c shows the EDX spectra of adsorbent
before and after Hg(II) and Pb(II) adsorption. The main elements shown
in the EDX spectra of Tm@CeNPs are C, O, and Ce, while after adsorption
of Hg(II) and Pb(II), these two element’s peak is also added
in the spectra of Tm@CeNPs. The surface morphology of the tamarind
dried leaves, CeNPs, Tm@CeNPs, Tm@CeNPs–Hg(II), and Tm@CeNPs–Pb(II)
is shown in Figure 10d–h, respectively. The CeNPs show in Figure 10e are spherical, after the coating of tamarind
powder the size of spherical-shaped CeNPs becomes broader as shown
in Figure 10f. After
Hg(II) and Pb(II) adsorption, the surface morphology of Tm@CeNPs changes,
which signifies the adsorption of these heavy metal ions on the adsorbent.
The elemental composition of these three adsorbents is also confirmed
by mapping images, that is, Figure 10i–k for Tm@CeNPs, Tm@CeNPs–Hg(II), and
Tm@CeNPs–Pb(II), respectively.

mapping images of Tm@CeNPs, Tm@CeNPs–Hg(II), and Tm@CeNPs–Pb(II),
respectively.

8.2 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The surface composition, elemental
oxidation states, and binding energy of each element involved in the
adsorbent before and after adsorption were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The main elements of Tm@CeNPs are C,
O, and Ce and after adsorption, Hg(II) and Pb(II) are also found.

Oxygen deconvolution spectra O 1s for Tm@CeNPs show three important
signals at 533.01, 531.22, and 529.54 eV (Figure 11a), which show the interaction of oxygen
of chemisorbed water, hydroxyl group, and oxide ion. There is a change
in the binding energy of these three signals after the surface modification
by heavy metal ion interaction of Tm@CeNPs. A decrease in the signals
by ∼0.28, 0.09, and 0.14 eV was observed, respectively (Figure 11b), which might
be due to the new interaction between the adsorbent and metal ion.

Figure 11 XPS
spectra of (a,b) oxygen before and after adsorption and (c,d) carbon
before and after adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) on Tm@CeNPs.

Deconvolution spectra of C 1s
for Tm@CeNPs show three peaks at 285.26, 287.38, and 288.44 eV (Figure 11c) corresponding
to C–C/C=C, C–O–C/C–OH, and C=O.28 After loading metal ions (Figure 11d), C–C/C=C
functional groups content decreased from 83.01 to 48.73%, while C–O–C/C–OH
and C=O functional groups content significantly increased from
8.73 to 41.48% and 8.27 to 9.79% (Table 7), respectively. The % composition of functional
groups was calculated using casa XPS software. Hence, the increased
percentage of oxygen-containing functional groups indicates the importance
and their active role in the interaction with Hg(II) and Pb(II). The
removal mechanism can be described as a surface complexation model
in which the oxygen-containing surface functional groups (i.e. C–O
and C=O) of Tm@CeNPs are responsible for the removal of Hg(II)
and Pb(II) ions.

Deconvolution spectra of Ce 3d for Tm@CeNPs
before and after Hg(II) and Pb(II) adsorption show four peaks, which
are assigned for 3d3/2 and 3d5/2. The peaks
at 885.01 and 891.4 eV are assigned to 3d3/2 and 900.91
and 903.52 eV are assigned to 3d5/2 (Figure 12a,b). Results show that the
binding energy decreases, which might be due to the interaction of
CeO2 with Hg(II) or Pb(II).

Figure 12 XPS spectra (a,b) of
cerium before and after adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) on Tm@CeNPs;
(c,d) XPS spectra of Hg(II) and Pb(II) on adsorption of Tm@CeNPs.

Moreover, the high-resolution
4f spectra of Hg(II) exhibit two signals at 103.76 and 99.74 eV (Figure 12c), which elucidate
the characteristic peaks of Hg(II) 4f5/2 and 4f7/2, respectively. The above results show that the mercury is present
in its oxidized state (+2) instead of its zero-valence state [Hg(0)].

Two peaks were appeared at 141.08 and 136.31 eV for Pb(II) 4f5/2 and 4f7/2, respectively with an energy separation
of 4.9 eV, which can be attributed to PbO. Results suggest that Pb(II)
is bonded with the oxygen group on the surface of Tm@CeNPs (Figure 12d). Table 7 shows the binding energy, %
content, and full width at half maximum (fwhm) values of each element
before and after adsorption of heavy metal ions.

8.3 X-ray Diffraction
Figure 13a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of Tm powder, CeNPs, and Tm@CeNPs. The XRD peaks of tamarind powder
appear at 25°61′, 29°99′, 31°87′,
35°06′, 36°11′, 49°35′, 59°95′,
and 62°69′. The XRD pattern of CeNPs matches with the
JCPDS card no. 00-031-0325. The Bragg planes in the CeNPs XRD pattern
(020), (110), (112), (200), and (220) confirm the synthesis of nanoparticles.
After the formation of the adsorbent, the peaks of CeNPs remain intact
in the Tm@CeNPs. The d-spacing value of the crystal
lattice is 2.124; the crystal structure is hexagonal and centrosymmetric.
The average crystal size of particles calculated by d-spacing value is 15.24 nm. Lattice strain is 0.0063, and fwhm of
the crystal lattice is 0.5642.

Figure 13 (a) XRD pattern of Tamarind powder, CeNPs,
and Tm@CeNPs and (b) Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
spectra of CeNPs, Tamarind powder, Tm@CeNPs, Tm@CeNPs–Hg(II),
and Tm@CeNPs–Pb(II).

8.4 Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of CeNPs show the characteristic peaks of nanoparticles.
The characteristic bands of CeNPs were found in two regions, that
is, 1100–1700 cm–1 and 3000–3800 cm–1. In addition to these, there is a band at 770 cm–1 assigned to the Ce–O bond. The characteristic
band at 3364 cm–1 is assigned to −OH stretching
vibrations of physical adsorbed water or surface hydroxyl groups.
The peaks seen at 1390, 1686, and 1046 cm–1 represent
bicarbonate type species and monodentate carbonate species with O–C–O
stretching.

In the FTIR spectra of tamarind dried leaves, the
characteristic peaks are found at 664, 1038, 1224, 1384, 1692, 1745,
2912, and 3308 cm–1. The peak around 1384 cm–1 corresponds to the presence of N–H stretching
of the amide group. The peak at 1692 cm–1 resembles
the carbonyl of carboxylic group peak, and the 1745 cm–1 peak resembles carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the ester group.
Owing to the existence of aromatic ortho disubstituted heterocyclic
molecules, an assignment occurs at 664 cm–1 for
ATFL indicating a possibility of ring cleavage after the coating of
CeO2. The peak around 2912 cm–1 is the
characteristic peak of C–H stretching and 3308 cm–1 for surface hydroxyl group (Figure 13b).

In FTIR spectra of Tm@CeNPs, all characteristic
peaks of CeNPs and Tm powder remain intact with a minor change in
the frequency, which might be due to the interaction between the CeNPs
and Tm powder. The peak at 3308 cm–1 of O–H
stretching of −OH group becomes broad because of H-bonding
(3300–3750 cm–1) after the formation of Tm@CeNPs.
In the FTIR spectra of Tm@CeNPs after adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II)
metal ions, the decrease in the intensity and wavenumber of peaks
indicates the formation of metal–oxygen bonds with their corresponding
functional groups (Figure 13b). From the FTIR analysis, the stretching peak of a hydroxyl
group (3451 cm–1) gets broadened because of H-bonding
(3400–3800 cm–1) (Figure 13b).

8.5 Thermogravimetric
Analysis–Differential Thermal Analysis
The compositional
analysis of the Tm@CeNPs was carried out using thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA). The TGA data of CeNPs, Tm powder, and Tm@CeNPs showed no significant
weight loss above 150 °C. However, the TGA data for the Tm@CeNPs,
CeNPs, and tamarind powder (Figure 14a) showed two independent weight loss steps, the first
step at 0–200 °C and the second step above 200 °C.
The second weight loss is highest in tamarind powder, that is, 42.31%,
and lowest in Tm@CeNPs, that is, 15.92%, which indicates that after
coating of CeNPs with Tm powder, the thermodynamic stability of the
synthesized adsorbent increases. The same result is shown by differential
thermal analysis (DTA) studies (Figure 14b).

Figure 14 (a,b) TGA and DTA thermograms of CeNPs,
Tm powder, and Tm@CeNPs, respectively.

9 Conclusions
This research studies the
adsorption of Hg(II) and Pb(II) by tamarind leaf composite. The synthesized
adsorbent was successfully utilized for Hg(II) and Pb(II) adsorption
with maximum adsorption capacity of 200 and 142.85 mg/g, respectively.
The surface area of Tm@CeNPs was found to be very high, that is, 412
m2/g. The adsorption process follows a multilayer type
of adsorption and PSO kinetics for both the metal ion adsorption processes.
The column study reveals that the multilayer type of adsorption and
Yoon–Nelson model fitted best. The mean free energy required
for Hg(II) adsorption is lower than Pb(II), which means that the Hg(II)
is easily adsorbed on the Tm@CeNPs. The use of tamarind leaves opens
a new class of adsorbent for the heavy metal ion removal, as the surface
area of dried tamarind leaves is very high. Thermodynamic studies
reveal that the adsorption process of heavy metal ion was feasible,
spontaneous, and exothermic. Increase in temperature does not favor
the adsorption process.

10 Materials
All the
analytical grade chemicals were commercially available and used without
further purification.

10.1 Synthesis
10.1.1 Synthesis of Ceria Nanoadsorbent
In order to synthesize
CeNPs, 0.05 M Ce salt solution was prepared in 100 mL of absolute
ethanol. Then, NaOH/ethanol solution was added dropwise under vigorous
stirring until the color of the solution changed from orange to yellow
and finally to a dark brown colloidal sol. The colloidal sol was centrifuged,
and the precipitate was collected and repeatedly washed with absolute
ethanol and deionized water to remove the impurities.

10.1.2 Pretreatment of TFL
The fresh tamarind leaves were
initially washed with 0.01 N HCl, followed by 0.01 N NaOH. Then, the
TFL was washed thoroughly using distilled water and dried by exposing
it to sunlight. The dried TFL was sieved to obtain particles 600 μm
in size.

10.1.3 Preparation of ATFL
About 30 g of TFL of 600 μm was soaked in 600 mL of 1% CaCl2 solution, for 24 h. Then, the soaked TFL was washed with
distilled water and dried at 110 ± 0.5 °C in an air oven
for 2 h.

10.1.4 Preparation of CeO2-Entrapped TFL
About 20 g of CeO2 NPs
was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water in a beaker and placed on
a magnetic stirrer at 90 °C for 30 min. To this, 24 g of ATFL
was added and the suspension was mixed gently and heated in a water
bath for 10 min. Then, this solution was transferred to a Teflon lined
stainless steel autoclave (200 mL) and put in the oven at 250 °C
for 2 h. The solid was cooled after the completion of the reaction
and washed with 0.05 M perchloric acid and distilled water until the
run-off was clear. The precipitate was dried and calcined in the muffle
furnace up to 513 K for 2 h. Figure 15 shows the binding mechanism of CeNPs with tamarind
powder. The binding of CeNPs with tamarind via H-bonding, electrostatic
interactions, and complexation between −OH group of CeNPs and
functional groups of tamarind, that is, carbonyl of −COOH,
−COOR, and −OH.

powder.

10.2 Batch
Experiment
In order to understand the adsorption process
of Tm@CeNPs for Hg(II) and Pb(II) heavy metal ions, different parameters
were studied in fixed range, that is, adsorbent dose (0.1–0.5
g), pH (3–10), initial concentration of heavy metal ions (10–100
ppb), contact time (5–70 min), adsorption/desorption studies,
and interfering metal ion (Ca(II), Al(III), Mg(II), Fe(II), Co(II),
Ni(II)) at room temperature. After analysis of these parameters, the
remaining metal ion concentration was analyzed by using atomic absorption
spectroscopy, and the % adsorption (% A) and adsorption
capacity (qe or qt) are calculated by using following eqs 1–3. 1   2   3  where Ci, Ce, Ct, m, V, qe, and qt are initial metal concentration
(ppb), equilibrium metal concentration (ppb) at time t, the mass of adsorbent (g), the volume of solution (L), adsorption
capacity at Ce, and adsorption capacity
at Ct, respectively.

10.3 Kinetic Studies
Kinetic-based models describe
the mechanism of adsorption and also explain the order of reaction.
The adsorption kinetics explains the rate of adsorbate uptake and
the contact time of adsorbate on the adsorbent interface. The heavy
metal ion adsorption process is significantly time-dependent and pretentious
by the chemical and physical properties of adsorbent. Thus, to explore
the adsorption mechanism, four different kinetic models—PFO,
PSO, IPD, and Elovich43−47 were used to study the different kinetic parameters. Linear eqs 4–7 of the following models
are 4   5   6   7  

10.4 Adsorption Equilibrium Studies
Adsorption
models explain the qe, adsorption mechanism
pathways, mode of adsorbate to interact with an adsorbent, and effectual
design of adsorption mechanism. There are several adsorption models
(i.e., Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and D–R isotherm models)48−51 from which most widely utilized models were used to study the adsorption
process, given below as eqs 8–13 8   9   10   11   12   13  

10.5 Thermodynamic Studies
The temperature plays a significant role in order to understand
the thermodynamics of the adsorption process, that is, in-depth understanding
of energetic changes during the adsorption process. Thermodynamic
variables, that is, ΔG (change in Gibbs free
energy), ΔH (change in enthalpy), and ΔS (change in entropy),52,53 were calculated
by using equation 14–16.

Equilibrium metal ion concentration: 14  

The ΔS is calculated by Gibbs–Helmholtz
equation, 15   16  

11 Column Study
The column studies were
done by utilizing fixed adsorbent dose, that is, 2 g; the length and
diameter of the column was 30.0 and 1.0 cm, respectively. The used
stock metal ion solution was 1000 ppb for Hg(II) and Pb(II), and the
flow rate was maintained at 5.0 mL/min. The outlet solution was analyzed
after each 10 min for the residual metal ion concentration. In order
to study the complete column study, four different models were utilized,
that is, Thomas, Yoon–Nelson, Yan, and Clark.54−57 The nonlinear and linear equations of these models are tabulated
in Table 8.

12 Physiochemical Characterization
The
surface properties of the adsorbents were analyzed by using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms with the use of the
BET method. In order to analyze the sample for BET analysis, about
20 mg of the sample was degassed for 3 h at 300 °C, and then
it was used for analysis. The morphology and elemental composition
of the adsorbent before and after adsorption were analyzed by FESEM
attached with EDX. Additionally, the surface chemistry and chemical
state of the element before and after adsorption were determined by
XPS. XRD patterns of the samples were collected using a model XRD
instrument. Cu Kα radiation was used in this study. The functionalization
of adsorbents was analyzed by FTIR spectra in the range 4000–400
cm–1. TGA and DTA analyses were carried out to the
study of characteristic physical changes in adsorbents.
