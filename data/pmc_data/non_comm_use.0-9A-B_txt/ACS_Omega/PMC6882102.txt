Robustness of superhydrophobic materials has been gradually
taken
into consideration for practical applications; however, little attention
has been paid to the impact resistance of the superhydrophobicity
of the materials. The present study demonstrated a new route for improving
the mechanical durability, especially the impact resistance, of the
superhydrophobic materials. First, poly(styrene-co-butadiene)/poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) (SBR/EVA) composite monoliths
with microscale cellular structures were manufactured by vulcanization-foaming
processes. Then the composite monoliths were treated with sandpaper
to create nanostructures above the revealed micropores after removing
the uppermost skin, forming micro/nanotextured surfaces and giving
improvements in superhydrophobicity. Due to the elastomeric nature
of SBR and EVA, the superhydrophobicity of the monoliths can be maintained
even while the material is mechanically impacted or compressed, and
wearing helps improvement or recovery of the superhydrophobicity because
of the self-similarity of the cellular structure inside the monoliths.
Additionally, the obtained superhydrophobic materials are resistant
to acidic, alkali, and salt liquors as well as organic solvents and
have easy healing capacity of superhydrophobicity with a simple sanding
treatment when destroyed by exposure to oxygen plasma.

Introduction
Improvement in durability of superhydrophobic
materials has received
much attention due to their wide range of possible applications including
self-cleaning,1 oil–water separation,2−5 anti-icing,6,7 drag reduction,8 anticorrosion,9−11 and other areas. The mechanical
stability of the topographic structure significantly affects the durability12 of superhydrophobicity. One strategy to improve
the structural stability is enhancing the interfacial interactions
between the micro/nanotextured structures and the materials by electrostatic
assembly,13,14 hydrogen bonds,15,16 chemical bonds,17,18 and polymer or inorganic binding19−22. For example, durable superhydrophobic coating was fabricated through
spraying the mixture of inorganic binder aluminum phosphate and nanoparticle
on the glass substrate.16 The coating could
remain superhydrophobic after sanding 500 times on account of the
hydroxyl cross-linking reaction between the inorganic binder and glass
substrate. Another is to create roughening structures directly from
the bulk matrix of materials at the surface. The roughening structure
is part of the substrate matrix as a whole, which avoids the interfacial
problems in the previous method that introduces extra materials onto
substrates. Many techniques have been introduced into the construction
of robust superhydrophobic structures including chemical etching,23−25 plasma processing,26−28 electrochemical reaction,29,30 and laser ablating31,32. Natural33,34 or artificial templates35,36 were also adopted in
a few studies that make for the forming of micro-nanostructures, which
have the same composition as the substrate.37

Recently, bulk superhydrophobic materials have been getting
much
attention, which not only have hierarchical monolithic structures
with the bulk substrate at the surface but also have self-similar
structures inside. These materials have micro/nanotextured structures
abound in the entire system.38−41 Therefore, even if the upper portion of the material
is worn away, the exposed portion at the bottom still has a similar
structure. In addition, wear-resistant elastomer materials (such as
silicone composite42,43 and EVA44) can be introduced during the preparation of the superhydrophobic
surface to enhance its durable properties. Davis et al.45 reported that superhydrophobic PDMS monoliths
with porous micro/nanotextured structures were produced through the
emulsion technique. The monoliths retained their antiwetting properties
even after being subjected to rigorous surface wear treatment because
of their self-similarity. In addition, due to the elastomeric nature
of PDMS, superhydrophobicity can be maintained even while the material
is mechanically strained or compressed. This method took into consideration
not only the antiabrasion property but also the strain and compress
properties, which is very useful for design of mechanically durable
superhydrophobic materials.

In this work, taking into consideration
the mechanical impact resistant
property, durable elastomer materials (SBR and EVA) were introduced
to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces utilizing their unique elasticity,
durability, and wear resistance. Additionally, micropores were formed
inside the composite monoliths during the fabrication process without
using any solvent through vulcanization-foaming and with the synergy
effect of the cross-linking agent dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as well as
sulfur (S) and blowing agent azodicarbonamide (AC), making the composite
materials superhydrophobic after sanding treatment, as shown in Figure 1. The superhydrophobicity
of the obtained SBR/EVA surfaces can be maintained even while the
material is mechanically impacted or compressed, and wearing of the
materials surfaces could result in improvement rather than loss of
the superhydrophobicity.

Results and Discussion
Morphology and Hydrophobicity of SBR/EVA Composite
The SBR/EVA composite was fabricated by mixed SBR (60 wt %), EVA
(40 wt %), WCB, cross-linking agent (DCP, S), and blowing agent (AC)
together evenly in the internal mixer, as shown in Figure 1a. Compared to the small density
of pure SBR and poor elasticity of pure EVA, 60 wt % SBR and 40 wt
% EVA were chosen to fabricate hydrophobic composite monoliths because
of their good dimensional stability and suitable cell distribution.46 During the process of composite vulcanization-foaming,
cells were generated and grew on account of swelling of the system
with the blowing agent, which decomposed into nitrogen and affected
the number and distribution of nucleated cells. The SBR/EVA composite
could maintain a stable state when taken out from the flat-panel curing
to room temperature, which made the bubble cells to gradually stop
growing. SEM images and CAs of SBR/EVA composites with different contents
of the blowing agent are shown in Figure 2. Different sizes of cells formed during
the process of composite vulcanization-foaming due to the poor compatibility
between SBR and EVA. It was found in Figure 2a–g that, as the content of the blowing
agent increased, the cellular diameter increased. Different sizes
of cells gave rise to microscale structures. The relationship between
the contact angle and blowing agent is shown in Figure 2h. The contact angle could reach 145°
when the blowing agent of AC was 2 wt %.

of blowing agent: (a) 0, (b) 0.5, (c) 1, (d) 1.5, (e) 2, (f) 2.5,
and (g) 3 wt %. (h) The relationship between contact angle (CA) and
blowing agent.

To explore the influence of the content of the
blowing agent on
the porous structure and the hydrophobicity of the composite materials,
cell distribution was measured by Software Nano Measurer 1.2. It was
demonstrated in Figure S1 that different
contents of the blowing agent resulted in various cell distributions.
With the increase of the blowing agent content, large cells appeared
gradually through the vulcanization-foaming process. Nonlinear fit
was used to measure the messy degree of cellular, which was better
when the R2 value is close to 1 commonly.
Conversely, that of departure means more messy microscale rough structures
in this paper; that is to say, wider cell distribution was obtained.
As shown in Figure S1d, the R2 value was 0.88182 when the blowing agent was 2 wt %,
which demonstrated that the widest distribution with different sizes
of cells appeared. It was obvious that a messy bubble phase produced
a rougher structure, which contributed to achieving superhydrophobicity.
The 2 wt % foaming agent was chosen as the optimal microstructure
monoliths because different sizes of cells were distributed widely.
Therefore, the SBR/EVA composite with the blowing agent of 2 wt %
was chosen as the primary sample for investigation in this paper.

Superhydrophobic Property of the Sanded SBR/EVA Composite
As shown in Figure 1b, the SBR/EVA composite was fixed on the friction instrument, and
sandpaper (400 mesh) was pasted on the top of the stainless-steel
column as the external force and moved repeatedly at a pressure of
45 KPa for 50 cycles. SEM images of superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composites
with different contents of the blowing agent are shown in Figure 3a and Figure S2. It was found that sanding treatment
produced micro-nanostructures on the SBR/EVA composite surfaces in
which the cellular structure generated in the process of composite
vulcanization-foaming provides the microscale structure, while nanoscale
roughness was obtained on the basis of micropores after sanding, and
the fabrication was conducted without using any solvents. Figure 3c shows the relationship
between the CA, SA of the superhydrophobic composite, and the amount
of blowing agent used. It was found that CAs of all samples could
reach 150° with SAs being less than 5°. Importantly, the
superhydrophobicity could be maintained even when layers of composites
were gradually sanded away, as shown in Figure S3. When the upper layer was worn away, the exposed new composite
layer still had a similar contact angle. That is to say, the microporous
structure abounded in the entire material. To further verify that
the as-generated microscale structure helped to achieve superhydrophobicity,
the SBR/EVA composite without adding a blowing agent was also investigated. Figure 2a shows that the
original unfoamed SBR/EVA sample was plain with a contact angle of
118°. With the sanding treatment, there was an increase of contact
angle with cycles of sanding. As shown in Figure S4, the unfoamed SBR/EVA sample required 250 abrasion cycles
to reach a contact angle of 152°. However, the foaming composite
could reach the state of superhydrophobicity with only 50 cycles of
abrasion. This demonstrated that the microscale roughness from foaming
of the SBR/EVA composite played an important role in superhydrophobicity.
Furthermore, different wearing approaches using various mesh sandpaper,
cloth, and stainless-steel column were conducted to illustrate whether
the material in our work has wear-independent similarity performance.47 It was found in Figure S5 that CAs of all sample could reach (or close to) 150° and SAs
could reach less than (or close to) 5°, which demonstrated superhydrophobicity.
The CAs first decreased then increased. It might be because that some
of the roughness was sanded away and finally exposed again on the
composite surface. Therefore, the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite
has wear-independent superhydrophobicity without losing its nonwetting
performance after various wear conditions.

agent after sanding. (b) Higher magnification of panel (a). (c) The
relationship between the CA/SA value and blowing agent.

Impact Resistance of Superhydrophobic SBR/EVA Composite
The impact resistance of the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA material is
very important for outdoor uses. The sample was evaluated by dropping
a given weight to impact the surface from 1 m height (Figure 4a) followed by CA and SA value
measuring. It was found that the superhydrophobic monoliths could
withstand 40 times impact without deformation and maintain the CA
greater than 150° and SA less than 5°, which is the state
of superhydrophobicity. Further impacting caused loss of the superhydrophobicity.
However, the superhydrophobicity could recover through placement of
the sample at room temperature for 4 h, showing the excellent healing
ability of the superhydrophobicity after intense impacting, as shown
in Figure S6. Importantly, although the
recovering time increased with increasing impact cycles, the sample
could retain the superhydrophobicity with a CA value greater than
150° and SA value less than 5° after 5 cycles of impacting
and healing, as shown in Figure 4c. The morphology changes of the SBR/EVA composite
displayed in Figure 5 demonstrated that the roughness decreased after dynamic impacts
and could recover when the sample was placed at room temperature.
3D images of the color difference of the sample show the roughness
changes in accordance with the SEM images of the sample treated. In
the impacting process, the samples were only affected by the dynamic
mechanical force; therefore, the decrease or loss of superhydrophobicity
might be mainly caused by the decrease of the surface roughness after
the intense dynamic force. After placement at room temperature, the
roughening structure could recover due to the elastic property of
SBR and EVA, making the material surface superhydrophobic. To further
test the impact resistance of the SBR/EVA composite, 1 kg mass of
weight was also used to hit the sample by the same method. The results
shown in Figure S7 demonstrated that the
SBR/EVA composite also retained superhydrophobicity after 18 times
of impacting, and the sample which lost superhydrophobicity could
recover its wetting state after 4 h of room-temperature placement.

cycles of the sample after 60 times of impact.

(b,e), and
recovered in 4 h (c,f) SBR/EVA composite. In panels (d–f),
the color difference means height change from a minimum position.

In order to check if the material has the ability
to heal the lost
superhydrophobicity caused by long-time static force, the superhydrophobic
SBR/EVA composite was compressed with a pressure of 0.5 MPa for a
given time, and the CA and SA values were measured. It was found that
the SBR/EVA composite could remain superhydrophobic for 20 h at a
pressure of 0.5 MPa with the CA value decreasing and SA value increasing
gradually. However, the superhydrophobicity of the compressed sample
restored automatically after 3 h of placement at room temperature,
showing healing capability. The sample could retain superhydrophobicity
after 5 cycles of compressing-healing. The composite molecular chain
could rebound rapidly after force release for SEM testing of the compressed
sample, which would cause errors between SEM result and real morphology.
Therefore, we used the hot press method to compress and cure the sample
before SEM testing. In Figure 6b, it could be seen that the surface of the composite was
made flat after hot compressing. However, after 3 h of placement at
room temperature, the rough structure appeared obviously as shown
in Figure 6c. Optical
profilometer images of the sample also show that the roughness changes
in Figure S8 are in accordance with the
SEM images. The surface roughness value of the sample changed from
2.598 (Figure S8a) to 1.697 μm (Figure S8b) in the compressing process followed
by the loss of superhydrophobicity. The surface roughness could recover
to 2.272 μm (Figure S8c) after placement
at room temperature. The reborn rough morphology might come from the
recovery of the structure due to the elasticity of the material, which
helped the healing of the structure for superhydrophobicity.

Chemical Stability of the Superhydrophobic SBR/EVA Composite
In practical applications, superhydrophobic materials are commonly
exposed to the external environment and are susceptible to be corroded
by chemicals. It is meaningful to consider the chemical stability
of the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite. The tests were conducted
by dipping samples into different pH solutions and various organic
solvents. Figure 7a
shows that the CA of the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite remained
above 150° and the SA was less than 5° that changed little
even after soaking in different pH solutions for 3 days. This indicated
that SBR/EVA composite surfaces were resistant to acidic, alkali,
and salt liquors. SEM images of the composite are displayed in Figure 7c–e, which
were dipped in hydrochloric acid (pH = 1, Figure 7c), sodium chloride solution (pH = 7, Figure 7d), and sodium hydroxide
solution (pH = 14, Figure 7e). The morphology of the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite
surfaces changed little showing no obvious damage. For comparison,
the original and superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composites were dipped in
water. The superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite showed a layer of bright
plastron on its surface in water as demonstrated in Figure 7f. This phenomenon might be
caused by the air layer trapped at the interface that separated the
water and the composite. This air layer could avoid direct contact
between the solution and the composite, making the superhydrophobic
SBR/EVA composite durable to different chemicals. Superhydrophobic
SBR/EVA composites were also soaked in various organic solvents for
3 days, as shown in Figure 7b. CA/SA values demonstrated that the as-obtained composites
were stable enough to remain superhydrophobic with little change of
the structure as shown in the SEM images (Figure S9).

chloride solution, pH = 7; and (e) sodium hydroxide solution, pH =

composite in water.

Healing Capability of Superhydrophobic SBR/EVA Composite through
Wearing
In order to show the easy-healing ability of the
superhydrophobic composite, samples were etched by oxygen plasma for
2 min and worn by sandpaper. It should be noted that oxygen plasma
treatment usually makes materials hydrophilic due to the breakdown
of the carbon chain of polymers, such as SBR and EVA, and introduction
of hydroxyl groups onto the surface. Therefore, the superhydrophobic
composite turned superhydrophilic with contact angle decreasing from
160 to 0°. However, the composite could easily regenerate its
superhydrophobicity through abrasion, as shown in Figure 8a. Abrasion  made the
composite lose the plasma caused  hydrophilic layer and
exposed a new hydrophobic roughening layer, obtaining superhydrophobicity. Figure 8b indicates that
the etching-healing cycles could be repeated to get a superhydrophobic
surface unless the monoliths were worn out. The element composition
change of the SBR/EVA composite was measured by XPS. It was found
that the content of oxygen in the sample treated by oxygen plasma
was 2 times higher than that of the original composite. Sanding treatment
reduced the content of oxygen obviously, showing recovery of the low-surface-energy
property in addition to roughening the surface by abrasion.

Conclusions
Durable superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite
surfaces were fabricated
through vulcanization-foaming and sanding without using any solvents.
The cellular structure provided microscale roughness in the process
of composite foaming, and sanding gave rise to nanoscale roughness
on the micropores of the cell, favoring superhydrophobicity with the
contact angle above 150° and sliding angle less than 5°.
The superhydrophobicity of the monoliths can be maintained even while
the material is mechanically impacted or compressed. Wearing helps
improvement or recovery of the superhydrophobicity. Additionally,
the obtained superhydrophobic materials are resistant to acidic, alkali,
and salt liquors as well as organic solvents and have easy healing
capacity of superhydrophobicity with a simple sanding treatment.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(styrene-co-butadiene)
(SBR-1502 M) was purchased from Petro China Co., Ltd. Poly(ethylene-vinyl
acetate) (EVA) was purchased from Jinju International Trade Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). White carbon black (WCB) was supplied by Jitong
Chemical & Technology Co., Ltd. (Shi Jiazhuang, China). Sulfur
(S) and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) were purchased from Tailong Plastic
Technology Co., Ltd. (Jinan, China). Azodicarbonamide (AC) was provided
by Huanzong International Trade Co., Ltd. (Dongwan, China). Solid
paraffin was supplied by Fuluo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou,
China). Zinc oxide (ZnO) and stearic acid (St) were purchased from
Guangdong South BASF Wax Co., Ltd. Sandpaper was purchased from Tongcheng
Tianli Emery Cloth Co., Ltd. (Hubei, China).

Preparation of the SBR/EVA Porous Monoliths
Three main
steps were adopted to prepare SBR/EVA composite monoliths. First,
60 wt % SBR, 40 wt % EVA, 0.5 wt % sulfur, and 0.6 wt % DCP as the
cross-linking agent, 25 wt % WCB, and 5 wt % paraffin as the reinforce
reagent, 9 wt % ZnO, and 3 wt % St as the blowing promoter, and 2
wt % AC as the blowing agent were mixed into an internal mixer (SM-0.5
L-K, Suyan, Jiangsu, China) for 20 min at 120 °C. Then the mixed
compounds were transferred to a two-roll mill (XH-401C, Xihua, Guangdong,
China) at 80 °C for 10 min to form composite sheets. Finally,
the SBR/EVA composite sheets were treated by flat-panel curing press
(XH-406, XiHua, Guangdong, China) at a temperature of 180 °C
and a pressure of 10 MPa for 450 s to obtain SBR/EVA composite monoliths.

In order to evaluate the influence of the content of the blowing
agent on the inside of the porous structure and the property of the
composite materials, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, and 3 wt % AC were also
used with other conditions unchanged.

Sanding Treatment of SBR/EVA Composite
The SBR/EVA
composite was fixed on the friction instrument (Figure 1b). Sandpaper (400 mesh) was pasted on the
top of the stainless-steel column. When the machine started to work,
the friction instrument bearing, which connected to the stainless-steel
column, moved back and forth on the surface of the composite. Then
the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA composite was obtained after the sanding
process.

Characterization
An FEI Q45 Environmental scanning
electron microscope (SEM) was used to analyze the surface morphology
of the material, which was sputter-coated with gold beforehand on
its surface. Water contact angles (CA) and sliding angles (SA) were
measured by a video optical contact angle system (OCA 20, DataPhysics,
Germany) with deionized water of 5 μL.

In order to evaluate
the mechanical impact resistant ability of the SBR/EVA composite,
the sample was impacted by 0.5 and 1.0 kg weights from 1 m height
for given times followed by CA and SA value measuring. Meanwhile,
the SBR/EVA composite was compressed under a pressure of 0.5 MPa,
and then the SEM and CA values of deformed and recovered composites
were measured at room temperature. 3D images of composite roughness
changes were also recorded on an HK8700 Ultra-Depth Microscope (Kyocera,
Japan) and optical profilometer (Bruker Countor GT K, Beijing).

Chemical stability testing was conducted by dipping the SBR/EVA
composite samples into solutions with different pH and organic solvents
(ethanol, THF, acetone, and DMF) for 72 h followed by SEM investigation
and CA/SA measurement of the dried samples.

In order to evaluate
the healing ability of the superhydrophobicity,
the superhydrophobic SBR/EVA sample was exposed to oxygen plasma (Tangshan
Yanzhao Science and Technology Institute, China) etching for 2 min.
Then the plasma-etched sample was abraded using sandpaper. CA and
SA values were measured, and the element content change was analyzed
by a K-alpha Thermo Fisher Scientific X-ray photoelectron spectroscope
(XPS).
