Villi-structured
polyaniline sheets (VPASs) were synthesized by
the organic single-crystal surface-induced polymerization (OCSP) method
using sodium decanesulfonate as a template. Aniline hydrochloride
is used as a monomer instead of aniline to improve the electrostatic
interaction between monomers and hydrated crystals, which reveals
that the mechanism of OCSP occurs from the electrostatic force between
positively charged monomers and the negatively charged surface of
hydrated crystals. Compared with conventional polyaniline (3.13 ×
10–2 S/cm), VPASs showed higher electrical conductivity
(1.07 × 10–1 S/cm). The thickness of double-layered
VPASs is about 136 nm, and the surface of VPASs shows a random porous
structure with a villi-like morphology. This morphological property
provides a large surface area, which can be advantageous to various
electrochemical applications. The process yields mass-producible inexpensive
materials, and the products are suitable for flexible devices because
of their characteristic morphology.

==== Body
Introduction
Electrically conductive
polymers (ECPs), polypyrrole, polythiophene,
and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), are well-known materials that
possess noticeable advantages, facile synthetic procedure, good conductivity,
and competitive price.1 Among ECPs, polyaniline
is a promising conductive polymer because of its relatively low cost,
good environmental stability, unique oxidation states with different
colors, and reversely controllable electrical conductivity, from the
insulating emeraldine base to the conductive emeraldine salt forms,
due to an acid–base doping/dedoping response.2−6 Because of these merits, polyaniline has been used in various electrochemical
applications: dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),7−10 chemical sensors,11,12 rechargeable batteries,13,14 and supercapacitors.15

Accordingly, there have been numerous
research studies to enhance
its electrical properties, and one of the promising methods is to
synthesize structured ECPs. Fabricating structured ECPs is a challenging
goal for developing a conducting polymer to a better material for
electrochemical applications. For example, Wei et al. developed attractive
poly/oligoaniline microstructures and characterized with various techniques
in details.16,17 Sahiner et al. also examined
various templated polyaniline synthesis methods using cryogels.18−20

Nanostrutures, such as nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanotubes,
and
nanofibers, can be fabricated by using hard templates, soft templates,
or template-free methods. Nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide and zeolite
channels,21−23 surfactants and block copolymers,24−27 and interfacial polymerization
or sonochemical methods28−30 can be good examples of each
method. Among these methods, synthesis of polyaniline hydrogels or
cryogels using poly(vinyl alcohol) as a supporting polymer showed
attractive viscoelastic and mechanical properties.31,32

Our previous research reported a novel synthesis method called
organic single-crystal surface-induced polymerization (OCSP).33 Unlike the conventional methods mentioned above,
OCSP utilizes a hydrated crystal as a soluble template which can be
obtained below the Krafft point. Through this polymerization method,
micro- or nanostructured conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole
hexagonal microplates and ultra-thin polypyrrole nanosheets (UPNSs),
can be obtained by a shape-duplicating process, which is performed
by electrostatic interactions between negatively charged surfaces
of hydrated crystals and cationic monomers or chains.33−35 UPNS has a two-dimensional structure, which provides fewer phase
boundaries, lower interparticle contact resistance, and higher charge
transport efficiency than other nanostructures of polypyrrole. On
the basis of these properties, UPNS was applied for a counter electrode
of DSSCs and chemical sensors and showed high efficiency for each
application.35−37

In this study, we report the synthesis of villi-structured
polyaniline
sheets (VPASs) by the OCSP method. Enhancing the electrostatic interaction
between monomers and negatively charged surfaces of hydrated crystals,
aniline hydrochloride was used as a monomer instead of aniline. We
successfully obtained VPASs which have a similar morphology to hydrated
crystals of sodium decanesulfonate (SDSn) with nanoscale thickness.
The surface of VPASs showed a random porous structure with a villi-like
morphology which provides an enlarged surface area. The VPASs present
about 3.5 times higher electrical conductivity (1.07 × 10–1 S/cm) than conventional polyaniline.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of VPASs
VPASs were synthesized in hydrated
surfactant crystal suspension by chemical oxidation. The polymerization
procedure of VPASs is simply described in Figure 1. SDSn was dissolved at 30 °C and started
to be recrystallized at around 4 °C while cooling down in 0.01
M HCl aqueous solution. Aniline hydrochloride was stabilized for 1
h to have adequate interactions between anilinium cations and hydrated
crystals. The shape-duplicating process by the electrostatic interaction
between negatively charged SDSn crystals and cationic pyrrole by oxidation
was identified in our previous research. The hydrated SDSn crystals
were negative charged because the surface of crystals consists of
sulfonate groups of SDSn molecules.35,37 We also tried
to synthesize polyaniline with the OCSP technique; however, for aniline,
it was regarded that the electrostatic interaction with hydrated crystals
is insufficient. Thus, aniline hydrochloride which can produce anilinium
cations in aqueous solution was used as a monomer to enhance the electrostatic
interaction. As a result, VPASs were successfully synthesized through
the OCSP method. The result shows that anilinium cations were absorbed
on negatively charged surfaces of SDSn crystals, and polyaniline chains
can grow on surfaces of anionic SDSn crystals by chemical oxidation.
After polymerization, the SDSn crystal was dissolved during the washing
process at room temperature, and it came out through the cracked or
ripped surface of the resulting double-layered VPASs. The product
with a dark-green color indicates the formation of an emeraldine salt
form.

Figure 1 Polymerization scheme of the VPASs by the OCSP method.

Morphology
The morphology of the
VPASs synthesized
via OCSP on SDSn hydrated crystals is revealed by optical microscopy
(OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). Figure 2 is
OM images of organic crystals of SDSn and VPASs synthesized through
the OCSP method. The OM image in Figure 2a shows the morphology of hydrated crystals
of SDSn after the addition and stabilization of aniline hydrochloride.
Hydrated SDSn crystals were formed in a hexagonal shape with a width
of ∼20 μm, a length greater than 30 μm, and used
as templates for adsorption of anilinium cations. Figure 2b shows the morphology of polyaniline
synthesized by the OCSP method when aniline was used as a monomer.
Because the electrostatic interaction between aniline monomers and
SDSn hydrated crystals is not sufficient, aniline monomers were not
able to be adsorbed on the surface of a crystal, and therefore, they
form amorphous morphology, as shown in Figure 2b. On the contrary, the sample polymerized
with aniline hydrochloride monomers well-duplicated the morphology
of SDSn crystals (Figure 2c). Aniline hydrochloride has anilinium cations, which can
increase the possibility to interact with negatively charged surfaces
of organic crystals. The size and the morphology of synthesized polyaniline
on SDSn crystal templates duplicate those of SDSn crystals well, meaning
anilinium cations interact with negatively charged surfaces of organic
crystals successfully. As a result, anilinium cations were able to
perform OCSP by electrostatic interaction, whereas aniline monomers
were not able to, and the result well-corresponds to the hypothesis
of our previous research.

stabilization with
aniline hydrochloride, (b) synthesized polyaniline by the OCSP method
using aniline as a monomer, and (c) single sheet of a VPAS sample.

The detailed morphology observation
of synthesized VPAS is shown
in Figure 3. Morphology
duplication ability of VPAS is well-displayed in Figure 3a. Figure 3b,c represents magnified SEM images of the
partially marked regions in Figure 3a,b, respectively. These images show a random porous
structure through interconnected polyaniline particles and a villi-like
morphology on the surface of a single sheet of VPAS. Most of conducting
polymers synthesized with OCSP just have a hollow structure, almost
stuck two layers like a sealed envelope or case. Although this is
the first time to use aniline as a monomer for OCSP, polyaniline chains
are propagated from the surface of the organic crystal to medium with
its intrinsic structure because of the unique character of aniline
during polymerization in water. Therefore, the sheet obtained a normal
shape-like sealed envelope with abnormal surface-like villi. These
morphological properties can provide an enlarged surface area, which
contribute to high electrocatalytic activity with an electrolyte and
thus can be advantageous to be applied in various electrochemical
devices.

of the VPAS surface of the regions partially marked in (a,b).

The AFM scan image and the corresponding
line profile of partially
ripped VPASs are presented in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the villi structure on the surface of VPASs, which have correspondence
with the morphological feature presented in the SEM images. The line
profile of the VPAS in Figure 4b confirms that the thickness of combined VPAS layers is ∼136
nm and that of a single VPAS layer is almost half the thickness of
combined VPAS layers.

Conductivity of VPASs
Electrical conductivities of
VPASs, HCl-redoped VPASs, and conventional polyaniline are presented
in Figure 5. To identify
the optimal concentration of HCl solution for the highest electrical
conductivity, various concentrations of HCl solution were used in
the redoping process. Figure 5a displays the curve of electrical conductivity of HCl-redoped
VPASs. The highest electrical conductivity was observed to be 6.49
S/cm at 0.4 M HCl concentration. At higher concentrations of HCl,
a decrease in electrical conductivity occurs which is due to overprotonation
of polyaniline chains causing a decrease in the delocalization length.
Conclusively, the effective HCl concentration for redoping VPASs is
0.4 M.38Figure 5b shows that the sample of VPASs is outstanding
in electrical properties because electrical conductivity of VPASs
was nearly 3.5 times higher than that of conventional polyaniline.

Figure 5 (a) Graph
and (b) actual values of electrical conductivities of
VPASs with different HCl concentrations and the conventional polyaniline
sample measured by a four-probe method.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 6 describe why VPASs show a higher conductivity
than conventional polyaniline. In the case of the conventional polyaniline
sample, crystalline peaks appeared around 2θ = 20° and
25°. The XRD pattern of VPASs shows that the peak around 15°
is discovered and the peaks around 25° are sharpened, compared
to conventional polyaniline. The peaks that appear at 15, 20, and
25° are three representative peaks of pure crystalline polyaniline,
indicative of (011), (020), and (200) crystalline planes of the emeraldine
salt form.39 This result suggests that
no additional crystalline order has been introduced by other materials,
and the packing of polyaniline main chain was increased by OCSP and
made VPASs more electrically conductive.39−41

polyaniline and the VPAS sample.

XPS Analysis of VPASs
To confirm doping levels of VPASs, Figure 7 shows N 1s core
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of VPASs. The binding
energy peak of benzenoid-amine (−NH−) is observed around
399.4 eV. The quinoid-imine peak (−N=) can be found
around 398.1 eV. The peak above 400 eV corresponds to positively charged
nitrogen (−•+NH−).42,43

Figure 7 XPS
N 1s core-level spectra of (a) VPAS, (b) dedoped VPAS, and
(c) redoped VPASs by 0.4 M HCl solution.

Figure 7a
presents
the XPS spectrum of VPASs. The peak above 400 eV is deconvoluted to
two peaks at 400–403 eV, and the doping level of VPASs is revealed
to be 23.3%. The doping level of polyaniline is defined as [Cl]/[Ntotal].44 It can be also calculated
that the ratio of the area of doped nitrogen peaks to the total peak
area of nitrogen ([N+]/[Ntotal]) indicates the
doping level because chloride ions have almost an equivalent amount
of positively charged nitrogen in polyaniline.10 The doping level of dedoped VPASs was measured to be 2.82%
as shown in Figure 7b. Dedoped VPASs present a dark-blue color of the emeraldine base
form (EB) and electrically insulating. These indicate that the dedoping
procedure was well-proceeded. Figure 7c shows the XPS N 1s core-level spectra of redoped
VPASs at the 0.4 M HCl concentration. The doping level of redoped
VPASs by 0.4 M HCl solution was measured to be 39.3%. This result
indicates that VPASs were properly redoped by HCl solution.

Conclusions
VPASs were successfully synthesized by the OCSP process using aniline
hydrochloride. Lowering the temperature of micellar solution below
the Krafft point, hydrated SDSn crystals were obtained and used as
a template for electrostatic interaction between anionic surfaces
of hydrated crystals and cationic monomers or oligomers. Aniline hydrochlorides,
which are ionized to anilinium cations in water, were used instead
of aniline; thus, the OCSP method was successfully performed by enhancing
the electrostatic interaction. Polyaniline was synthesized on the
surfaces of SDSn crystals and formed hexagonal-shaped sheets, which
has a morphology similar to SDSn crystals. Combined thickness of top
and bottom VPAS layers was around 136 nm. Surfaces of VPASs showed
a random porous structure and a villi-like morphology, which can provide
a large surface area. With the most suitable HCl doping concentration
for VPASs, the optimized electrical conductivity was obtained as 6.49
S/cm. VPASs showed 3.5 times higher electrical conductivity than the
conventional polyaniline because of increased packing of polyaniline
chains.

Experimental Section
Materials
Aniline hydrochloride
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99%)
was used as a monomer. Ammonium persulfate (APS) (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%)
was used as an oxidant with no further purification. Sodium 1-decanesulfonate
(SDSn) (TCI, 98%) was used as received. HCl aqueous solution and ammonium
hydroxide solution (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as a doping and dedoping
agent, respectively.

Synthesis of VPASs
VPASs were synthesized
by dissolving
8 mmol of SDSn (1.95 g) in 80 mL of 0.01 M HCl aqueous solution. The
solution was stirred at 30 °C for 30 min with a constant temperature
circulator and cooled down to 0 °C. To recrystallize of SDSn,
the solution was stabilized for 30 min with vigorous stirring. 8 mmol
of aniline hydrochloride (1.04 g) was added to the solution and stabilized
for 1 h. An oxidant solution was produced by dissolving 8 mmol of
APS (1.83 g) in 0.01 M HCl aqueous solution (20 mL) at room temperature.
Preventing template dissolution by temperature difference between
APS solution and organic crystal suspension, APS solution was precooled
at 0 °C and added to the solution at a rate of 10 mL/h using
a syringe pump. The solution was polymerized for 5 h with stirring.
The product was washed with 0.01 M HCl aqueous solution, methanol,
and acetone several times using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane
filter with 100 nm pores. After washing, VPASs were obtained as an
emeraldine salt form. Conventional polyaniline was prepared for comparison,
in the same condition of VPAS synthesis except the presence of templates.

Dedoping and Redoping of VPASs
After washing, the product
was immersed in 1 M ammonium hydroxide solution for 24 h at room temperature,
and the VPAS emeraldine EB (VPAS-EB) was obtained. VPAS-EB was filtered
with an aspirator and a PTFE membrane filter.

Filtered VPAS-EB
was immersed in 0.2 M HCl aqueous solution to redope for 24 h at room
temperature. For comparison, VPAS-EB was redoped in various concentrations
of HCl aqueous solution (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 M) for the same number
of hours. Redoped products were washed with each redoping concentration
of HCl aqueous solution, methanol, and acetone.

Characterization
The morphology of organic crystals
of SDSn and VPASs was observed by an OM (Nikon ECLIPSE LV100N POL)
and a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 450). AFM
(PSIA XE-100) was used for analyzing the thickness and the surface
morphology of the VPASs. The electrical conductivity (298 K) of compressed
pellet of the synthesized VPASs was measured by a four-point microprobe
method using a Jandel contact probe (Advanced Instrumental Technology
CMT-100M). X-ray diffraction patterns was measured by XRD analyzer
(Rigaku Ultima IV) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation
operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The scan angle covered 10° <
2θ < 50° at a speed of 5°/min. The doping level
of VPASs, dedoped, and 0.4 M HCl redoped VPASs was measured using
XPS with a twin anode Mg/Al X-ray source (XPS, VG Multilab ESCA 2000
system).
