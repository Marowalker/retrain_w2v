Azadirachtin-A
(AzaA) from the Indian neem tree (Azadirachta indica) has insecticidal properties;
however, its molecular mechanism
remains elusive. The “targeted and nontargeted proteomic profiling”,
metabolomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of
flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging, gene expression, and in silico analysis
provided clues about its action on Helicoverpa armigera. Fourth instar H. armigera larvae
fed on AzaA-based diet (AzaD) suffered from significant mortality,
growth retardation, reduced larval mass, complications in molting,
and prolonged development. Furthermore, death of AzaD-fed larvae was
observed with various phenotypes like bursting, blackening, and half-molting.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) data
showed limited catabolic processing of ingested AzaA and dramatic
alternations of primary metabolism in H. armigera. MALDI-TOF imaging indicated the presence of AzaA in midgut of H. armigera. In the gut, out of 79 proteins identified,
34 were upregulated, which were related to digestion, immunity, energy
production, and apoptosis mechanism. On the other hand, 45 proteins
were downregulated, including those from carbohydrate metabolism,
lipid metabolism, and energy transfer. In the hemolymph, 21 upregulated
proteins were reported to be involved in immunity, RNA processing,
and mRNA-directed protein synthesis, while 7 downregulated proteins
were implicated in energy transfer, hydrolysis, lipid metabolism,
defense mechanisms, and amino acid storage-related functions. Subsequently,
six target proteins were identified using labeled AzaA that interacted
with whole insect proteins. In silico analysis suggests that AzaA
could be efficiently accommodated in the hydrophobic pocket of juvenile
hormone esterase and showed strong interaction with active site residues,
indicating plausible targets of AzaA in H. armigera. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested differential
gene expression patterns and partly corroborated the proteomic results.
Overall, data suggest that AzaA generally targets more than one protein
in H. armigera and hence could be a
potent biopesticide.

==== Body
Introduction
The neem tree (Azadirachta indica) has long been recognized for
its unique properties, both against
insects and in improving human health.1,2 Azadirachtin-A
(AzaA) is a well-known tetranortriterpenoid limonoid phytochemical
and natural pesticide molecule.3−5 It is present in seed, leaves,
and other parts of the neem tree. It is known as a feeding deterrent
and a strong growth disruptant for many arthropods. Interestingly,
it is remarkably nontoxic to vertebrates. AzaA has a very complex
structure; hence, it took nearly 17 years to elucidate its full structure.
Unlike many other plant compounds, AzaA alone is a strong antifeedant
and thus exploited commercially. There is an implicit assumption that
AzaA strongly influences insect hormones through interference with
the neuroendocrine system.

Many attempts have been made to understand
the molecular action
of AzaA in various insect species.6−13 AzaA’s structure is multifaceted, complicating an understanding
of its chemistry.1,14−16 It interferes
with the molting of insects and has growth regulatory and sterilant
effects.8 Its action as an antagonist of
the molting hormone and therefore its ability to cause alterations
in the development of insects, as well as its effects on their reproductive
ability, have been widely documented, especially in Lepidoptera.8 Moreover, in most of the cases, it also produces
a disruption of their feeding habits.17

Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera:
Noctuidae; Hübner) is a devastating pest of many important
crop plants throughout the world and thus responsible for heavy economic
losses.18 This pest feeds actively on various
plants for development and progression into the reproductive adult
phase. However, current strategies for the control of H. armigera have relied heavily on conventional chemical
control, resulting in the development of resistance in H. armigera to almost all of the insecticides (www.pesticideresistance.org/; www.iraconline.org/).19,20 Considerable research has demonstrated the
potential of insects to adapt to diverse phytochemicals and toxins.21−23

Most insecticides have a single highly conserved protein target,
thereby not only harming beneficial insects but also facilitating
resistance evolution in pests. Hence, a pesticide with multiple targets
without harmful ecological effects is needed. This motivated us to
understand the mechanism and toxicity of AzaA in H.
armigera. Feeding experiments using AzaA in H. armigera confirmed that it is a strong antifeedant
and growth disrupter and showed insecticidal potency. Here, we report
the distribution of AzaA in H. armigera, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time
of flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging. The presence of AzaA in the insect
was confirmed independently. The comparative molecular approach revealed
differences in gut and hemolymph of H. armigera reared on artificial diet with or without AzaA. Striking alterations
of primary metabolism were observed upon ingestion of AzaA by the
insects. Pull-down assays with labeled AzaA identified several proteins
like apolipophorin III, mannose 6 phosphate isomerase, fatty acid
binding protein (FABP), diguanylate cyclase, juvenile hormone esterase
(JHE), and arylphorin, indicating there are multiple targets of AzaA
in H. armigera.

Results
Antibiosis
of AzaA to H. armigera Larvae
To evaluate the effect of AzaA, our observations
of larvae fed on AzaA-based diet (AzaD) showed a variety of diverse
phenotypes, including bursting of the whole insect, molting arrest,
and many others (Figure 1A). As expected, food consumption and larval mass were dramatically
reduced (Figure 1B,C).
The larvae fed on AzaD showed stunted growth (Figure 1D). These results confirmed that AzaA is
a potent insect antifeedant with growth-disrupting properties as reported
earlier. This phenotypic diversity suggested that AzaA could have
several targets for its toxic mode of action.

in 4 days (black bar), whereas insects fed on AzaD could consume only
∼20% of the total diet (hollow bars). (D) Photograph of larvae
grown on an AzaD showing stunted growth (bottom row) and AD diet showing
normal growth (top row).

MALDI-TOF Imaging Detected AzaA in the Midgut of H.
armigera
We investigated the localization
of AzaA in the midgut of H. armigera by axial MALDI-TOF imaging of insect cross sections with a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) matrix that provided a uniform deposition of a matrix ion
(Figure 2A). The experimental
protocol used was sensitive, yielding mass spectra with clear signals
for the [M + Na]+ ion of AzaA from very low amounts (64
ppm in the diet). The chemical identity of the compound was confirmed
by mass spectrometry analysis. In the MS spectrum of AzaA, the molecular
peak at m/z 743.25 corresponds to
the [M + Na]+ adduct ion. MALDI-TOF spectra were collected
from the whole insect in both X and Y directions. Conversion of the ion chromatogram into ion intensity
images showed a distribution of AzaA within the midgut of larvae (Figure 2B). Statistical evaluation
indicated that AzaA was present only in the midgut of the insect.
As expected, the larvae reared on diet lacking AzaA (AD) did not show
any signal for AzaA (Figure 2C).

show signal for AzaA after LDI-TOF/MS imaging.

Metabolomic Analysis Indicates Minimal AzaA Catabolism while
Strongly Affecting Primary Metabolism in H. armigera
First, we have annotated the most important mass fragments
by proposing the fragmentation pathway of the AzaA (Figure 3, Suppl. Figures 2 and 3). This information will be of interest for
future mass spectrometric studies where AzaA precursor analyte and
its transformation products/metabolites can be correlated. Further
in the metabolomics analysis, we focused on the potential biotransformation
and/or catabolism of AzaA. Based on common detoxification pathways,
biotransformation metabolites were proposed (Suppl. Table 5). Out of 35 proposed biotransformation products from
AzaA, 9 have been found in the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) and mentioned in Suppl. Table 5. However, to confirm the presence of these metabolites, the study
of the product ion scan of those compounds will be necessary. Most
probable degradation products of AzaA are shown in Table 1. An interesting consideration
to consider is the combination of the biotransformations. Figures 4A,B and 5 show accurate mass-extracted ion chromatogram (am-XIC)
traces in LC–MS for two predicted most abundant potential metabolites
from AzaA, [(AZA-CH2-H2O) + H]+ and
[(AZA-2CH2-H2O) + H]+. Both results
are from saponification of either one or two methylester groups of
AzaA (Table 1). The
intensities of additional AzaA metabolite’s peaks were low
(below 1%) in comparison to AzaA peak, which confirms that AzaA is
not transformed into other metabolites to a significant degree. Intact
AzaA was detected in H. armigera larvae
fed with 32–128 ppm concentration range of AzaA as the corresponding
[M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ ions. The total intensity
of the ions is shown in Suppl. Figure 4. At the lowest concentration (32 ppm), the signal dramatically increased
from that in normal AD-fed larvae. However, the amounts of AzaA in
larvae fed on higher AzaD did not increase proportionately. It may
be explained by the deterrent effect of AzaA as larvae have fed less
on diet with increasing AzaA levels (Figure 1C).

In the metabolomics analysis, we further investigated
the AzaA
effect on the general metabolism/catabolism of H. armigera. About 30 primary metabolites like amino acids (AAs), fatty acids,
intermediates in glycolysis and the citrate cycle, UDPs, and sugars
were evaluated in relation to AzaA feeding group, as shown in Suppl. Data 1 (see also Suppl. Data 2–4). Three basic trends
were observed: (i) no change, (ii) metabolite downregulation, and
(iii) metabolite upregulation after feeding on AzaD. Diverse patterns
were observed for amino acids (AAs). While lysine, arginine, and glutamate
increased, histidine, serine, glutamine, and proline did not change.
Many of the AAs from the list, such as asparagine, aspartate, leucine,
phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, etc., were dramatically down at
128 ppm AzaA. Among the downregulated AAs, asparagine, phenylalanine,
and threonine showed decreased levels even at 32 ppm dose. In contrast,
cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan increased at 32 ppm dose that
later decreased. All studied fatty acids and other neutral lipids
gradually decreased (data not shown). The citrate cycle was also affected
by AzaA treatment. Citrate and succinate initially increased to 32
ppm and further decreased with increase in AzaA level. Overall, strong
primary metabolite alterations were observed even at the lowest AzaA
amount (32 ppm).

Proteomic Patterns in H. armigera upon Exposure to the AzaA
A comparative proteomic approach
was used to investigate the protein differences in gut and hemolymph
of H. armigera reared on AD and AzaD.
In this study, 107 differentially expressed proteins from gut and
hemolymph of AzaD-fed H. armigera were
identified by nano-LC–MSE. Database searches combined
with gene ontology (GO) analysis were used to infer the functions
of proteins identified. Among the 79 proteins identified in the gut,
34 proteins related to digestion, immunity, energy production, and
apoptosis mechanism were upregulated, while 45 proteins involved in
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and energy transfer were downregulated
(Suppl. Table 3). In hemolymph, among 28
proteins, the 21 upregulated proteins were involved in immunity, RNA
processing, and mRNA-directed protein synthesis, while the 7 downregulated
proteins were implicated in energy transfer, hydrolysis, lipid metabolism,
defense mechanisms, and amino acid storage-related functions (Suppl. Table 4). Overall, from gut and hemolymph,
55 proteins were upregulated, while 52 proteins were downregulated
in AzaD-fed H. armigera.

Targeted Proteomic
Analysis Identifies Several Targets of AzaA
in H. armigera
By using fluorescently
labeled AzaA (NBD-based), targeted proteomic analysis was performed
with PAGE. A native PAGE protein profile of H. armigera after incubation with labeled AzaA is shown in Figure 4. Fluorescent protein bands
were cut and subsequently identified using mass spectrometry. Protein
identification by search with the NCBI insects database identified
six proteins, viz., apolipophorin III, mannose 6 phosphate isomerase,
fatty acid binding protein, diguanylate cyclase, juvenile hormone
esterase (JHE), and arylphorin.

Gene Expression Analysis
of H. armigera upon AzaA Exposure
From the differentially regulated proteins,
we selected 15 candidate genes for expression analysis. Transcripts
of six of these genes (glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase—GAPDH,
aminopeptidase, trypsin isoforms 1 and 2, acyl CoA binding protein,
and a heat shock protein) were upregulated in AzaD-fed H. armigera larvae and transcripts of cathepsin,
fatty acid binding protein, arginine kinase, arylphorin, chymotrypsin,
JHE, trypsin isoform 3, and carboxypeptidase were downregulated (Figure 6). However, superoxide
dismutase (SOD) (Cu/Zn) remained constant in both the AD- and AzaD-fed H. armigera. Trypsin isoforms exhibited complexity
in expression profiles. Trypsin isoforms 1 and 2 were found to be
most abundant in gut tissue of AzaD-fed insects, and trypsin 1 showed
nearly 10 times higher expression than the rest of the isoforms, while
in gut tissue of AzaD-fed insects, levels of trypsin isoform 3 were
decreased. AzaD-fed larvae showed ∼8× downregulation of
the chymotrypsin gene expression compared to AD-fed larvae, while
acyl CoA binding protein and heat shock protein were significantly
upregulated in AzaD-fed H. armigera. Except for superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn) and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
dehydrogenase, the other genes were significantly differentially expressed
in either AD- or AzaD-fed H. armigera.

Molecular Interaction of AzaA with JHE from H.
armigera
The proteomic and gene expression
analysis data upon AzaD exposure suggested that JHE, a key enzyme
involved in insect development and metabolism, could be one of the
probable targets of AzaA. We therefore explored the interaction between
JHE and AzaA with the help of molecular docking using AutoDock 4.2.24 To validate the docking protocol, we extracted
3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (OTFP) from the co-crystal
structure of JHE (PDB ID: 2FJ0) and redocked OTFP with JHE.25 The docked conformation of OTFP shows an root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of 1 Å with the crystal structure pose indicating enough
docking accuracy. Subsequently, the docking between AzaA and JHE was
performed using a similar protocol. The single lowest energy conformation
was selected from the largest cluster having binding free energy of
−6.94 kcal/mol (Figure 8C). In this conformation, AzaA binds within a long narrow
tunnel containing the enzyme active site (Figure 7A). The tunnel opened at the surface of the
protein (Figure 7B)
that allowed entry and accommodation of AzaA (Figure 7C,D). Hydrophobic residues lining the tunnel
interacting with AzaA included Leu-98, Phe-150, Phe-259, Phe-311,
Leu-313, Phe-361, Phe-365, Ile-360, and Ile-368 (Figure 6e,f). Moreover, Gly-147, Gly-146,
Ala-227, and His-471 underwent direct hydrogen-bonding interactions
with AzaA at one end of tunnel (Figure 8A,B). This network
of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions stabilized AzaA in
the substrate binding cavity of JHE. Interestingly, the bound conformation
and interaction of AzaA was similar to observed OTFP in the crystal
structure. Thus, the theoretical interaction pattern of AzaA with
JHE offered a convincing rationale for the results with the labeled
compound.

Discussion
The defensive and versatile detoxification
mechanism in H. armigera is a potential
key for their survival.
This mechanism may have originally evolved for protection. Another
possibility is that it may have been reinforced by the vast use of
pesticides used by farmers. Considering this and the desirability
of avoiding synthetic pesticides, a multitargeted natural pesticide
like AzaA can be of widespread use for insect control. In this context,
we have shown how the prolific use of a broad-spectrum AzaA could
control insect pests. This biopesticide has the ability to keep the
insect engaged in defensive or detoxification interactions while reducing
food consumption. Many studies have shown that AzaA is a strong antifeedant.8,26−31 We confirmed this and additionally demonstrated that the antifeedant
action resulted in a less-than-proportional uptake of the compound.
This still leaves some scope for intoxication, which would not occur
if feeding ceased immediately and completely.

The spatial distribution
of AzaA in H. armigera within the midgut
might be critical in explaining its toxicity in
insects. Ion intensity maps constructed from MALDI-TOF mass spectra
demonstrated that some ingested AzaA remained in the midgut of H. armigera, where the majority of the digestive,
defensive, transport-, detoxification-, and immunity-related mechanisms
are controlled. This provides the access for AzaA to interact with
multiple targets.

The present metabolomic analysis sheds light
on the degradation/catabolism
of AzaA by H. armigera. The fragmentation
pattern and products of AzaA are proposed. General metabolism of H. armigera upon AzaA ingestion indicated that many
amino acid levels decreased in the larvae. Alteration of primary metabolism
was notable even at the lowest (32 ppm) AzaA exposure. All lipids
and citrate cycle were strongly affected by AzaA ingestion. Overall
data indicated inability of H. armigera larvae to metabolize AzaA, and thus the insects could not avoid
the toxic effect. Alternately, even metabolized products could also
affect primary metabolism of the insect, resulting in antibiosis.

Proteomic examination of AzaA-fed insects revealed regulation of
processes that have not been previously reported, such as fatty acid
metabolism. Long-distance flight of species like locusts and hawkmoths
is fueled through fatty acid oxidation.32,33 Locust flight
muscle cytoplasm contains an abundant fatty acid binding protein (FABP).
Recombinant rEs-FABP9 and rEsABP10 are two lipid metabolism-related
proteins in the innate immune system of the mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis (order, Decapoda; family, Varunidae).34 As an FABP was downregulated in AzaD-fed H. armigera, one effect of AzaA could be to reduce
the muscle tone and immunity of the larvae. Cofilin provides another
example of a different type of target. Gene ontology indicated that
cofilin is mainly involved in the biological process of actin filament
depolymerization, i.e., disassembly of actin filaments by the removal
of actin monomers. Cofilin regulator 14-3-3 zeta is an evolutionarily
conserved protein required for phagocytosis and microbial resistance.35 In the present study, cofilin was found in reduced
level in AzaD-fed H. armigera, which
could lead to lower immunity of these insects. SODs provide an important
cellular enzymatic defense against the detrimental reactive oxygen
species generated by aerobic metabolism.36 GAPDH is known to interact with different biomolecules. Many cellular
activities, including programmed cell death and nuclear RNA transport
unrelated to the commonly known carbohydrate metabolism, are also
affected by GAPDH.37 Cytochromes P450 are
important enzymes and may confer resistance to insecticides.38 SODs, GAPDH, and P450s were all downregulated
in AzaD-fed insects. Protein regulation by AzaA ingestion thereby
affected many different biological processes in these insects.

Since AzaA binding may or may not affect the biological activity
of a protein, the role of most of these as potential toxic targets
of AzaA, identified for the first time here, remains to be investigated.
However, we followed up on the binding to JHE by modeling the docking
of AzaA. In the highest-affinity conformation, AzaA occupied the active
site of JHE, which would be predicted to inhibit its activity toward
its natural substrates. Since juvenile hormone affects so many processes
in insect differentiation and physiology, perhaps some of the effects
we have documented result from AzaA binding to the single target JHE.
Further research will be required to separate the downstream consequences
resulting from the binding of AzaA to various proteins. If several
independent targets of AzaA can be demonstrated, this would suggest
that it will be more difficult for insects to evolve resistance to
AzaA than to many currently used insecticides that have a single major
target.

This study confirms the antifeedant and toxic effects
of AzaA on
the key agricultural pest H. armigera, which has evolved resistance to most insecticides in current use.
Our observations of a variety of diverse responses at transcript,
protein, and metabolite levels, as well as the identification of different
binding targets, indicate that the mode of action might exploit many
different targets in the insect, making AzaA a promising compound
for future development to combat the growing problem of insecticide
resistance in this and other crop pests worldwide.

Materials and
Methods
Chemicals
Acetonitrile, bovine serum albumin, and sequencing
grade-modified trypsin were procured from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis,
MO). MassPrep predigested standard protein rabbit glycogen phosphorylase
B, RapiGest, and enolase were purchased from Waters Corporation (Manchester,
U.K.). All other chemicals of analytical grade were procured locally,
in India. Extraction of neem limonoids AzaA from the neem seed kernel
was performed as described by Alam et al.39 7-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-based labeled AzaA was used
for gel electrophoresis experiments.40

Insect Feeding and Collection of Tissues
Actively feeding H. armigera larvae collected from fields were transferred
and maintained on artificial diet (AD).41 Azadirachtin-A-based diet (AzaD) was prepared in four concentrations
by adding AzaA (0, 32, 64, and 128 ppm in 70% ethanol) to AD. To ensure
greater genetic homogeneity among test populations, the insects were
maintained on AD for three generations. To understand the effect of
AzaD on growth and development of H. armigera, a set of insects were fed on AD up to early fourth instar and then
transferred to AzaD. After transfer to AzaD, the insects were fed
about 96 h continuously on it and used for collecting the insect tissue
samples. For control group, the insects were continuously grew on
AD and harvested at the same time. Furthermore, to observe insect
performance on AzaD, the insects were fed on the AD and AzaD continuously
and larvae were carefully weighed after every 24 h. For metabolomics
analysis, the insects were anesthetized by chloroform and snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Larvae were stored at −20 °C until
further analysis. For MALDI imaging, H. armigera larvae were grown on an artificial pinto bean-based diet (AD) till
early fourth instar stage. AzaD was prepared by mixing AzaA (64 ppm)
in artificial pinto bean-based diet. Samples for MALDI imaging were
collected from insects shifted from AD to AzaD as described above.

MALDI Imaging
Insects which fed on AD and AzaD were
anesthetized by chloroform and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Larvae
were manually cut into three pieces by using a blade, in an attempt
to isolate foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Cryo-sections (16 μm)
of insects were taken by using a Leica cryomicrotome (Leica CM1850,
Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb, Germany). The cross sections were attached
by thawing on a MALDI stainless steel target plate (Waters) and quickly
transferred into a desiccator for drying. The target plate was kept
in a vacuum desiccator, dried for 3–4 h, and then sublimated
with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) at 140 °C for 5 min at 0.05
Torr. A MALDI microMX mass spectrometer (Waters) fitted with a nitrogen
laser (337 nm, 4 ns laser pulse duration, 10 Hz, and 154 μJ
per pulse) was used in reflectron mode and positive polarity for data
acquisition using MassLynx version 4.0 software. The x, y coordinates for the imaging acquisition were
defined by using proprietary software with 50 μm step size.
Data collected with MassLynx 4.0 were processed with custom-made software
MALDI Image Converter (Waters). Finally, the data were exported to
ImageJ (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) and converted
into two-dimensional ion intensity maps. The converted data files
were imported into Biomap (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) for image
visualization and processing. The chemical identity of the compounds
was confirmed by mass spectrometry on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with an ESI source and
Excalibur v.2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) software for
data acquisition.

Metabolomics Analysis
Four AzaD-fed
larval groups (0,
32, 64, and 128 ppm AzaD-fed larvae) were analyzed for metabolomics.
In brief, three frozen larvae from a single AzaD-fed group were pooled
up together as one biological replicate. Three such replicates were
performed for each AzaD-fed group. Each replicate was weighed and
ground into a powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.
Around 150–200 mg of powder (visibly 1/10 of the vial of 4.5
mL capacity) was transferred into a liquid nitrogen precooled glass
vial (4.5 mL capacity). Extraction solvent mixture was added according
to the weight of tissue (2 mL extraction solvent/100 mg tissue) in
the vials. The extraction solvent consisted of MeOH (50 mL), ethyl
acetate (50 mL), 13C6-glucose (1 mL, 10 mg/mL), 13C6-phenylalanine (100 μL, 10 mg/mL), and
D27-palmitic acid (1 mL, 10 mg/mL) solutions made in MeOH/ethyl
acetate mixture. Each vial was vortexed for 3–5 s and then
sonicated for 15 min at room temperature (24 °C). During sonication,
the vials were once inverted and mixed at the seventh minute. The
vials were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min at 4 °C
and the supernatant was separated from debris, stored in glass vials
(4.5 mL), and kept at −80 °C prior analysis.

Ultra-high-performance
liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC–ESI–MS)
was performed with the larval extract using the Ultimate 3000 series
RSLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus hybrid
quadrupole-orbitrap (Q-Exactive Plus) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ESI source. A 2
μL volume of the extract was injected into the UHPLC binary
solvent system of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B, hyper
grade for LC–MS, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), both containing
0.1% (v/v) formic acid (eluent additive for LC–MS, Sigma-Aldrich,
Steinheim, Germany). Chromatographic separation was achieved using
an Acclaim C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm2, 2.2 μm;
Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) at a constant flow rate of 300 μL/min
as follows: 0.0–100% (v/v) B (in 15 min) and held at 100% B
for 10 min. A mass spectrometer was set for positive- or negative-ion
mode acquisition with an ESI voltage to 35 V, mass resolution to 70 000
full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and mass acquisition range to m/z 100–1500. Tandem mass spectra
for the extracts were obtained on the same instrumental setup with
the following parameters: survey scan at 70 000 FWHM was followed
by TOPN ddMS/MS scan with quadrupole selection window 0.8 Da, ion
count threshold of 5.3e4, automatic gain control target 1e6, and maximum
IT time of 150 ms with 35 000 FWHM mass resolutions. Higher-energy
collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentations were performed in a
quadrupole with nitrogen as collision gas with ramped normalized collision
energy in steps 10, 30, 60 V. Dynamic exclusion window was set to
2700 s.

A total of 20 pure metabolite standards (including AzaA)
were measured
in LC–MS under similar condition to obtain the reference retention
times. Structural elucidation for metabolites not included in the
standards were performed from TOPN-derived HCD spectra using accurate
mass and isotopic pattern for full MS data and from comparing HCD
data with our internal and public (MassBank, METLIN) databases. Data
analysis was accomplished using Excalibur v.3.0.63 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Relative quantification of identified metabolites
was performed by relating the total ion intensity of metabolite peak
to the total ion intensity of one of the three labeled internal standards
added to extracts (Suppl. Data 2–4).

The first aspect of metabolomics analysis
was to investigate the
potential transformation products and/or metabolites of AzaA (Suppl. Figure 1) in H. armigera. It was divided in two approaches: (i) to elucidate the MS fragmentation
pathway of AzaA and (ii) to study the expected degradation or biotransformation
within the chemical structure of AzaA, according to the most common
biotransformation pathways for detoxification in insect metabolism,
to establish a direct relationship between the precursor AzaA and
its metabolites.

The second aspect of metabolomics analysis
was to elucidate the
effect of AzaA on the general metabolism of H. armigera. In this aspect, we initially made a list of metabolites of interest
coming from various metabolite classes such as amino acids, fatty
acids, sugars, and glycolysis/citrate pathway intermediate (Suppl. Table 1). In the list, 32 metabolites
could be detected reliably in LC–MS on the basis of their reproducible
retention time and peak shape. Thus, we showed data for these 32 metabolites
only (Suppl. Table 2). Among the 32 metabolites,
retention times for 20 metabolites were obtained using standards.
These 20 metabolites were identified in larval extracts on the basis
of retention time and exact monoisotopic mass (such metabolite’s
names are suffixed as “_true” in the supplementary XLS
file; Suppl. Data 1). Other metabolites
were putatively identified on the basis of exact monoisotopic mass
(±5 ppm). LC–MS data were acquired in both positive- and
negative-ion modes. LC–MS peak areas were calculated for the
metabolite ions [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, and [M
– H]− separately (Suppl. Data 2–4) using ThermoXcalibur
processing setup-Quan identification browser (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) and averaged for three replicates, plotted over AzaD
concentrations (Suppl. Data 1). Finally,
we normalized the lowest LC–MS peak area to 1 among the four
AzaA feeding groups to simplify outlook and visualize the up/downregulation
trend of a particular metabolite by relative peak area comparison
(Suppl. Data 1).

Proteomic Analysis
Proteins from gut were extracted
by the phenol method according to the Schuster and Davies42 protocol with slight modifications. Proteins
from H. armigera hemolymph were extracted
by a trichloroacetic acid–acetone method.43 Target identification with the help of the proteomic approach
by using 7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-based labeled AzaA was
carried out with the in-gel digestion protocol.41

Proteins were extracted from AD-fed whole larvae
and mixed with labeled AzaA and incubated in the dark at 24 °C
for 2 h. This incubated protein mixture (20 μg each) was loaded
onto a 15% polyacrylamide separation gel with a 4% stacking gel and
electrophoresed at 20 °C using a vertical polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis apparatus.44 The gels were
run at a constant current of 50 A/gel until the fluorescent band reached
the bottom of the gel. The electrophoresis was carried out in the
dark to avoid quenching of fluorescently labeled AzaA. The gels were
visualized by using a transilluminator (Bio-Rad UV Transilluminator
2000, Hercules, CA). Fluorescent protein bands were excised from the
PAGE gels, in-gel digestion, and a NanoAcquity ultraperformance liquid
chromatography (UPLC) coupled to MALDI-SYNAPT-HDMS (Waters) was performed
for proteomic analysis, as reported by Dawkar et al.41

Data processing and database searching and the continuum
LC–MSE data were processed and analyzed using Protein
Lynx Global
Server 2.5.2 software (PLGS, Waters), and protein identifications
were done by the Lepidopteran database (www.uniprot.org). Data-independent
MSE data sets for the ion accounting search algorithm within
PLGS were investigated according to Li et al.45 Digested enolase (100 fmol) was spiked in the samples to quantify
the protein samples. Three biological replicates (30 insects in each)
were used for all experiments.

Molecular Docking Study
of AzaA with H. armigera Juvenile Hormone
Esterase
The structure of AzaA (CID 5281303)
was obtained from the PubChem compounds database. The geometry optimization
and partial atomic charges were assigned to ligand molecule using
Gaussian 09 program.46 The X-ray structure
of juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) covalently bound with inhibitor
3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (OTFP) (PDB ID: 2FJ0) was retrieved from
Protein Data Bank.47 The ligand was extracted
from PDB file and hydrogen atom was added. The Kollman united atom
charges and protonation state were assigned to receptor atom.24 Molecular docking has been performed between
JHE and AzaA using AutoDock 4.2.24 The
residues known to play important roles in JHE activity and substrate
binding (Gly-146, Ser-226, Ala-227, Phe-259, Leu-313, Thr-314, Glu-357,
Phe-361, Tyr-424, and His-471) were treated as flexible.47 The grid box was set to 70 × 60 ×
56 points with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å centered on the selected
flexible residue and active site of JHE. The grid box contains the
entire binding site of JHE, which provides enough space for translation
(0.25 Å) and rotation (5°) of the ligand, with the rest
of the docking parameters kept to their default values. Thus, 100
docking rounds were performed. The generated docked conformations
were clustered with an RMSD tolerance of 1.5 Å and ranked by
predicted binding free energy.

Gene Expression Analysis
by Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR)
To evaluate the expression
pattern of genes on AzaD, relative transcript
levels of selected target genes were checked for respective treatment
diets. Overall, 15 genes were considered from the proteomics data.
Total RNA for one biological replicate was isolated from pools of
10 larvae using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Synthesis
of cDNA was done by High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems). qPCR was performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) to examine transcript abundance of selected
target mRNAs. RT-qPCR analyses were done as described earlier.48 The list of primers used for RT-qPCR analyses
is given in Suppl. Table 3.

Statistical
Analysis
Data were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance with Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons
tests. All of the data were expressed as mean ± standard error.
Data points were considered significant at p ≤
0.05, p ≤ 0.01, and p ≤
0.0001.
