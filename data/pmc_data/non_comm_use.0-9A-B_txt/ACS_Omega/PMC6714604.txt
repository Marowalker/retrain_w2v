Coal
with its complex porous medium and abundant oxygen functional
groups could be used as an adsorbent to adsorb organic compounds.
Adsorption experiments and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the behavior
of methylene blue (MB) on the surface of Wiser bituminous coal. The
influence of adsorption through factors, such as pulverized coal dosage,
adsorption reaction time, initial concentration, and temperature effect,
was investigated. The removal efficiency of MB reached 96.5% under
optimum reactive conditions. The adsorption equilibrium was accorded
with a Langmuir isotherm adsorption equation. The adsorption of MB
onto coal was a spontaneous process because the adsorption free energy
ΔG0 was negative. It was consistent
with the conclusion of a negative interaction energy between bituminous
coal and MB obtained by molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, the
density distribution along z-axis of each component
molecule showed that MB molecules were adsorbed on the coal surface
because of the polar interactions between the methyl groups of MB
and the hydrophilic sites at the coal surface. Also, the diffusion
degree of water molecule in liquid phase showed that as MB molecules
formed hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, the activity of water
molecules was restricted.

1 Introduction
Recently, China has become
the world’s largest producer
of soft goods with its enormous productivity. Dyeing wastewater
plays a major role in industry wastewater outlet with the rapid development
of chemical fiber and textile industry in China. Dye wastewater is
generated from production processes of textile products.1 With the increasing complexity of production
technology and unceasing expansion of industry, dye wastewater is
becoming more and more difficult to treat.2 Dye wastewater has a complex composition, high pH, color depth,
and poor biodegradability.3 It usually
contains high concentrations of organic compounds, most of which are
refractory, toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. Methylene blue (MB)
exists in water as cations and is widely used in dyeing process. Because
of its strong affinity to solids, MB has been widely studied.4,5 There are many methods to treat dyeing wastewater, such as biological
treatment, coagulation, electrochemical adsorption, and oxidation.6−9 Among these techniques, adsorption is characterized by use of less
space, well decolorization effect, and high disposal efficiency, which
can be applied to the disposal of textile dying wastewater.10−12

Coal with its complex porous structure and abundant oxygenic
groups
can be used as a natural adsorbent in water treatment. After the adsorption,
the coal can also be used for its original purpose without its quality
being reduced. At the same time, it can reduce the organic matter
discharge in water. Thus, coal as an adsorbent has been researched
in some studies.13,14 The adsorption capacity of methyl
orange onto modified ultrafine coal powder was much better than that
of ultrafine coal powder, and the process was spontaneous and exothermic.15 The coking coal exhibited properties well-suited
for the adsorption of organics, and the Freundlich isotherm provided
reasonable models of the adsorption process.13 Moreover, the pH had an effect on the sorption of organic contaminants by coking coal in wastewater. The chemical oxygen consumption
(COD) and phenol removal efficiencies increased with decreasing pH
value, while the ammonia removal efficiency was decreased gradually.16 The process of coal adsorption–column
flotation was developed for the treatment of oily wastewater, and
it had a good effect.17

With the
rapid development of computer technology, computer molecular
simulation has became a powerful tool to study the structure and behavior
of molecules. Recently, quantum mechanics methods and molecular dynamics
methods have been widely used to investigate interactions between
water, organics, and minerals.18,19 For example, Rai et
al. studied the crystal structure specificity
of oleate molecules for different silicate minerals as well as its
interactions with the same silicate minerals with different crystallographic
planes.20 Wang et al. investigated the
adsorption of dodecylamine (DDAH), oleate (NaOL), and their mixture
on a muscovite surface in an aqueous solution. The results indicate
that DDAH molecules are absorbed on the muscovite surface by electrostatic
interactions and hydrogen bonding. In contrast, NaOL molecules are
not independently adsorbed on the muscovite surface.21 Wang et al. also investigated the surface activity and
self-aggregation behavior of the DDA/alcohol mixtures at the water/air
interface using molecular dynamics simulation and surface tension
measurement.22

Among the above-mentioned
methods, MD simulations are also widely
used to investigate the interactions on coal/surfactant (collector)/water
surface. You et al. revealed the interaction of surfactant molecules
with the water–coal interface using molecular dynamics calculations.
The results showed that the adsorption was mainly controlled by polar
interactions between the ethoxylate group of NPEO-10 and the hydrophilic
sites on the coal surface.23 Lyu et al.
studied the behavior of nonylphenol ethoxylate with 12 ethylene oxide
groups (NPEO-12) on the model surface of Hatcher sub-bituminous coal
using molecular dynamics simulations. The results showed that the
adsorption capacity of C–O group for NPEO-12 was higher.24 Zhang et al. studied the density profiles of
oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms. Their result indicated that the coal’s
surface properties affect the structural and dynamic characteristics
of the interfacial water molecules.25 Zhang
et al. studied the interactions between Wiser bituminous coal, different
collectors, and water using molecular dynamics calculations. The results
showed that the adsorption of nonylphenol on the coal surface via
both π–π stacking and hydrogen bonds is most favorable,
followed by that of nonylbenzene and dodecane.26

Nevertheless, few reports deal with the interactions
of coal surfaces
with organic pollutants in the dye wastewater. Herein, the effect
of bituminous coal on the adsorption performance of MB was studied
by adsorption experiments, and its adsorption thermodynamics were
analyzed. In addition, we aimed to examine the adsorption of MB on
the surface of Wiser coal using MD simulations. The details of MB–coal
interactions were revealed by dynamical behavior of the coal/MB/water
system. The findings of this investigation could possibly provide
insights into the theoretical description of the interaction between
MB and coal surface at a molecular level.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Adsorption Experiments
2.1.1 Effect of Coal Consumption
The
experimental process was as follows: 50 mL of MB solutions (50 mg/L)
was placed in several conical flasks of 100 mL. Coal samples of different
weights were respectively added to the conical flasks to determine
the optimum dosage. The flasks were put into a thermostatic oscillator
and stirred for 2.5 h at room temperature (about 25 °C).

The effect of pulverized coal consumption on the adsorption of MB
is illustrated in Figure 1. It was evident that the adsorption capacities of MB by coal
decreased with the increase of coal consumption. However, the removal
efficiencies of MB increased. As to the removal efficiencies and adsorption
capacity of MB by bituminous coal, the bituminous coal consumption
is 2 g in this paper.

Figure 1 Effect of bituminous coal consumption on the adsorption
capacities
and removal efficiencies.

2.1.2 Effect of Oscillation Contact Time
The
experimental process was as follows: 50 mL of MB solutions (50
mg/L) was placed in several conical flasks of 100 mL. Then, 2 g of
the coal sample was respectively added to the conical flasks. The
flasks were put into a thermostatic oscillator and stirred for different
times at 288, 298, and 313 K.

The effect of temperature and
time on the adsorption of MB on bituminous coal is illustrated in Figure 2. The adsorption
capacity increased with increase of adsorption time. The adsorption
capacity first increased rapidly and then slowed down and became constant
after more than 6 h. Moreover, the adsorption capacity increased with
the increase in temperature. The results showed that the adsorption
of MB on bituminous coal is temperature sensitive. A higher temperature
could increase the adsorption of MB on bituminous coal.

Figure 2 Effect of oscillation
contact time on the adsorption capacities.

2.1.3 Effect of Initial Concentration
Experiment
steps were as follows: MB solutions of different initial
concentrations (50 mL) were placed in several conical flasks of 100
mL. Then, 2 g each of coal sample was added to the conical flasks.
The flasks were put into a thermostatic oscillator and stirred for
12 h at 288, 298, and 313 K.

The effect of temperature and the
initial concentration of MB on the adsorption of MB on coal is illustrated
in Figure 3. Then,
isotherm constants were obtained by using a linear regression analysis
to the linear forms of the isotherm expression of the adsorption experiments.
The isotherm constants and the correlation coefficients are shown
in Table 1. The curves
of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm linear regression are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively.
The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm constants for MB adsorption on
bituminous coal at different temperatures are listed in Table 1.

Table 1 Langmuir and Freundlich Isotherm Constants
of MB’s Adsorption onto Bituminous Coal at Different Temperatures

313	1.81732	2.0208	0.9973	0.011	1.56564	0.0659	0.8817	
From Table 1, it
can be found that the R2 values of the
Langmuir equation were all higher than 0.99, suggesting that the adsorption
of MB on bituminous coal closely fits the Langmuir model. It indicated
that the absorption was of monomolecular type. Then, the RL values from the Langmuir model were all between 0 and
1, indicating a favorable sorption process. At the same time, the
1/n values from the Freundlich model were all less
than 1, also indicating a favorable sorption process.

The adsorption
free energy (ΔG0) can be expressed
by the follow equation 1  where R is the ideal gas
constant, T is the absolute temperature, and K0 is the distribution ratio. A straight line
is obtained by the plot of ln () as a dependent variable and Qe as an
independent variable. The intercept of the straight
line is ln K0.27 The adsorption free energy calculated are −9.003,
−18.46, and −32.64 kJ/mol at 288, 298, and 313 K, respectively.
The adsorption free energy is negative. The results indicated that
the adsorption process was spontaneous.

2.2 MD Simulations
2.2.1 Adsorption of MB on Bituminous Coal Surface
The adsorption
of MB and water molecules on the bituminous coal
surface was calculated by MD simulations. The final equilibrium adsorption
configuration is shown in Figure 5. It was evident that MB was closer to the coal surface
by comparing the configuration before and after adsorption. It can
be concluded that MB was adsorbed on the coal surface. To study the
adsorption of MB on the bituminous coal surface further, the mass Z-dependent density profiles for MB were calculated with
the simulation results. The Z-axis is normal to the
coal surface. The Z-dependent density distributions
are shown in Figure 6. From Figure 6, it
can be found that the density distribution of coal is basically uninfluenced
by the surrounding environment. In addition, MB molecules can be detected
at the coal–water interface. In the bituminous coal/MB/water
system, the density of MB molecules peaked at 57.49 Å and the
density of water molecules peaked at 82.49 Å. MB was closer to
the coal surface. In addition, at the same distance from the coal
surface, the molecular density of water without MB is slightly higher
than that of water with MB. The result demonstrated that MB molecules
were adsorbed on the coal surface. Coal comprises hydrophilic sites
distributed on a hydrophobic surface. MB adsorption was probably driven
by the polar interactions between the methyl groups of MB and the
hydrophilic sites at the coal surface.23

structure snapshot of MB near the bituminous coal.

Figure 6 Density distributions of coal, MB, and water molecules along the Z-axis.

2.2.2 Interaction
Energies
The interaction
energy can be used to measure the intensity of interaction between
MB and the coal surface. The interaction energy between MB and the
coal surface can be expressed by the following formula 2  where Etotal is
the total energy of the system and Ecoal, EMB, and Ewater are the energy of the coal surface, MB, and water, respectively. Ecoal+water, Ewater+MB, and Ecoal+MB are the total energy of
the coal surface and water, the total energy of the water and MB,
and the total energy of the coal surface and MB, respectively.24 The interaction energy between the coal surface
and MB is −122.28 kJ/mol by simulation calculation. The negative
value indicates that the adsorption process between the coal surface
and MB is spontaneous. The simulation results are consistent with
the adsorption isothermal experiment results, which proves the accuracy
and feasibility of the simulation calculation.

2.2.3 Mobility of Water Molecules
After
the addition of MB on the coal surface, its surface properties changed,
which influences the behavior of water. The mobility of water molecules
on the coal surface could be evaluated by calculating their mean square
displacement (MSD) and diffusion coefficient (D).

MSD can be used to describe the deviate degree of particle position
and initial position at some point. It can be expressed as follows 3  where N is the number of
atoms, ri(0) is the particle
initial position, and ri(t) is the position vector at time t.

Diffusion coefficient can be used to reflect the intensity
of water
molecule’s mobility. The expression is as follows 4  The
expression of diffusion coefficient by
combining expression (3) and (4) is as follows 5  From formula 5, it is seen that the diffusion coefficient
can be
obtained by measuring the slope of the mean square displacements.
The MSD curve of water molecules in coal/MB/water system is shown
in Figure 7. At the
same time, the diffusion coefficients of water molecules are obtained
by fitting the curves in the graph, as shown in Table 2.

Figure 7 MSD curves of water molecules.

Table 2 Diffusion Coefficients of Water in
Bituminous Coal/MB/Water and Bituminous Coal/Water Systems
system	D/(10–5 m2/s)	
bituminous coal/MB/water	5.25	
bituminous coal/water	6.7	
It can be seen that the diffusion coefficient of water
molecule
in the coal/water system is larger than that in the bituminous coal/MB/water
system. It was evident that the mobility of water molecules is reduced
after the adsorption of MB on the coal surface. Because MB formed
hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, as shown in Figure 8, the activity of water molecules
was restricted.

bond: light
blue dashed line).

3 Conclusions
Both experiments and MD simulation methods were
carried out to
investigate the adsorption behavior of methylene blue (MB) on bituminous
coal. The obtained experimental data indicated that the adsorption
could be a typical monolayer adsorption, best described by a Langmuir
isotherm adsorption equation. The adsorption was spontaneous.

MD simulations were used to examine the interaction of MB with
the model surface of Wiser bituminous coal in the aqueous phase. The Z-dependent density distributions showed that MB molecules
were adsorbed on the coal surface. Coal comprises hydrophilic sites
distributed on a hydrophobic surface. MB adsorption was probably driven
by the polar interactions between the methyl groups of MB and the
hydrophilic sites at the coal surface. In addition, the calculated
MSD and diffusion coefficients of water molecules demonstrated that
their mobility reduced after the adsorption of MB on coal surface.
It also showed that MB molecules attracted the water molecules because
of hydrogen bond. The adsorption free energy ΔG0 was negative, in agreement with the spontaneous adsorption
simulations observed.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials Synthesis
A bituminous
coal sample was provided by Linhuan Coking Co., Ltd located in Linhuan,
Anhui province, China. The coal sample was first hammer-crushed and
then ground in an agate mill. The ground material was sieved to obtain
−74 μm size particles for adsorption experiment. MB with
purity greater than 99.5% was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. and used as the adsorbate in this paper.

4.2 Batch Adsorption Test
The adsorption
capacities of MB on bituminous coal were investigated in batch adsorption
experiments. The adsorption capacity of coal was measured indirectly
with a UV–vis spectroscopy at 665 nm, which was the maximum
wave length for MB in the paper. Then, 50 mL of MB solutions was placed
in several conical flasks of 100 mL. The coal samples of different
weights were respectively added to the adsorbate solutions of different
concentrations. The flasks were put into a thermostatic oscillator
and stirred for different times at a constant temperature. After that,
the aqueous phase was filtered using a syringe filter and the residual
concentration in solution was analyzed. All the adsorption experiments
were conducted in three parallel groups. The residual concentration
was then converted to concentration using calibration curves for MB.
The adsorption capacity of coal was calculated using the expression 6  The removal efficiency of MB was calculated
using the expression 7  where Qt (mg/g) is the MB adsorption of per gram adsorbent, C0 (mg/L) is the initial MB concentration, Ct (mg/L) is the MB concentration
at time t, V (L) is the volume of
MB solution, and W (g) is coal consumption.

4.3 MD Simulations
MD simulations were
conducted using Materials Studio 8.0 package. The COMPASS forcefield
was applied for all simulations.23,24 Because the
physical and chemical structures of coal are very complex, the bituminous
coal surface was built using previously proposed molecular structure
of Wiser coal, as shown in Figure 9a.28,29 The coal structure model proposed
by Wiser in the United States in 1970s is considered to be a more
comprehensive and reasonable model. It presents the most modern concepts
of the macromolecular structure of coal and can reasonably explain
the liquefaction and other chemical reaction properties of coal. Then,
the Wiser, MB, and molecular structures of water were evaluated. To
obtain a relatively stable three-dimensional molecular space model,
the structures of all molecules were optimized. The optimized molecular
models are shown in Figure 9b–d. Then, 20 optimized Wiser molecules were randomly
packed in a cubic simulation cell 43 × 43 × 43 Å3 with three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions. Anneal
algorithm calculation for Wiser coal cell was carried out to achieve
structure relaxation of the coal surface model. Structure relaxation
carried out from 1098 to 298 K was followed by optimization and equilibration
for 100 ps at 298 K. A van der Waals interaction cutoff of 15.5 Å
was employed, and the Ewald summation method with an accuracy of 10–5 kcal/mol was used to account for the long-range electrostatic
interaction. Figure 10a shows the structure. Then, the Z-axis was extended
such that slabs in neighboring cells will not interact with each other.
Moreover, the cell containing 10 MB molecules and 3000 water molecules
were constructed and optimized according to the above methods, respectively.
Finally, a new rectangular simulation cell 43 × 43 × 250
Å3 (X × Y × Z) containing the above three optimized cells was obtained
by a building layer. The coal cell, MB cell, and water cell are the
bottom, middle, and top layer, respectively. The system is shown in Figure 10b.

MD simulations were run at NVT ensemble at 298 K employing
a Nose
thermostat, with the time step equaling 1.0 fs.30 Also, the van der Waals interaction cutoff of 15.5 Å
was employed, and the Ewald summation method with an accuracy of 10–5 kcal/mol was used to account for the long-range electrostatic
interaction. A simulation was performed for 1 ns. The final results
were calculated based on the production of 1000 ps simulation after
the equilibration period. During the simulation, the coal surface
was frozen to save computational time.
