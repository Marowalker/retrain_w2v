Human
plasma to be analyzed for exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors
is stored at 4 °C or lower to prevent denaturation of human butyrylcholinesterase
(HuBChE), the biomarker of exposure. Currently published protocols
immunopurify HuBChE using antibodies that bind native HuBChE before
analysis by mass spectrometry. It is anticipated that the plasma collected
from human casualties may be stored nonideally at elevated temperatures
of up to 45 °C for days or maybe weeks. At 45 °C, the plasma
loses 50% of its HuBChE activity in 8 days and 95% in 40 days. Our
goal was to identify a set of monoclonal antibodies that could be
used to immunopurify HuBChE from plasma stored at 45 °C. The
folding states of pure human HuBChE stored at 4 and 45 °C and
boiled at 100 °C were visualized on nondenaturing gels stained
with Coomassie blue. Fully active pure HuBChE tetramers had a single
band, but pure HuBChE stored at 45 °C had four bands, representing
native, partly unfolded, aggregated, and completely denatured, boiled
tetramers. The previously described monoclonal B2 18-5 captured native,
partly unfolded, and aggregated HuBChE tetramers, whereas a new monoclonal,
C191 developed in our laboratory, was found to selectively capture
completely denatured, boiled HuBChE. The highest quantity of HuBChE
protein was extracted from 45 °C heat-denatured human plasma
when HuBChE was immunopurified with a combination of monoclonals B2
18-5 and C191. Using a mixture of these two antibodies in future emergency
response assays may increase the capability to confirm exposure to
cholinesterase inhibitors.

Introduction
The current Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention protocol
for analyzing exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors is based on the
fact that organophosphorus toxicants bind irreversibly to human butyrylcholinesterase
(HuBChE) in human plasma. Exposure is detected with mass spectrometry
by measuring an adduct on the active site serine of HuBChE in the
peptide FGESAGAAS.1−4 HuBChE is a minor component in human plasma having
a concentration of 4 mg/L against a background protein concentration
of 60 000 mg/L. The first step in the published protocols selectively
extracts HuBChE from plasma by binding HuBChE to an immobilized antiHuBChE
monoclonal antibody.

It is anticipated that some plasma samples
will have been stored
under conditions that denature HuBChE (i.e., at elevated temperatures
for prolonged periods). Monoclonals that recognize denatured HuBChE
would enhance the sensitivity of the immunopurification-based assay
for confirming exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors. Our goal was
to develop a set of monoclonals that could be used for immunopurifying
heat-inactivated, denatured HuBChE.

We started our study by
asking what happens to pure tetrameric
HuBChE when it is stored at 4 and 45 °C and boiled at 100 °C.
We expected to find irreversible loss of activity in HuBChE exposed
to elevated temperatures, but we did not know whether elevated temperatures
caused the protein to precipitate or the HuBChE tetramer to dissociate
into dimers and monomers or to fragment by breaking peptide bonds.
We also did not know which immobilized monoclonals would serve to
immunopurify heat-denatured HuBChE. Having learned what to expect
from our studies of pure HuBChE, we applied the information to human
plasma samples stored at elevated temperatures for prolonged times.

In this study, we use the term “boiled HuBChE” for
heat-denatured HuBChE. There are many ways to denature HuBChE, including
treatment with high or low temperatures, organic solvents, high pressure,5 drying, aqueous solvents with an extremely low
or high pH, cross-linking agents such as glutaraldehyde, chaotropic
agents such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride, digestion with proteases,
disulfide bond-reducing agents, and amino acid-modifying agents such
as fluorescent IRDye 800CW.6 Each of these
can cause complete loss of enzyme activity, so that the treated enzyme
can be described as “completely denatured”. However,
the structural change in the protein may be unique to the treatment.
Therefore, we define heat-denatured HuBChE as “boiled”
rather than as “completely denatured”.

NC.

Antibodies
Monoclonal B2 18-5 was previously produced
against native HuBChE in mice.7 The heavy
and light chain nucleotides of B2 18-5 were sequenced, cloned into
expression vectors, expressed in a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell
line, and the antibody purified by Syd Labs, Natick, MA.8 B2 18-5 efficiently immunopurifies HuBChE from
plasma stored at 4 or −20 °C.8 Antimouse IgG conjugated to horse radish peroxidase was from Cell
Signaling, cat# 7076.

Monoclonal C191 was created at the University
of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) by injecting mice with denatured,
recombinant human HuBChE expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
The recombinant HuBChE had been denatured and reduced by boiling in
1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) containing 5% mercaptoethanol before
it was injected into mice with an adjuvant. The coding sequence had
been modified to delete the 44 amino acids in the tetramerization
domain at the C-terminus and to reduce the number of N-glycans from nine to five. The amino acid sequence and crystal structure
of the truncated HuBChE protein can be found in Protein Data Bank
entry 1P0I.9

Purification of Monoclonal
C191 on Protein G Agarose
Monoclonal C191 was purified from
mouse hybridoma cell culture medium
on Protein G agarose using 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.5 for equilibration
and washing, 0.1 M citric acid pH 2.6 for elution, and 1 M sodium
phosphate pH 9.5 for neutralization. The buffer was changed to phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and the protein concentrated to 5 mg/mL by diafiltration
through an Amicon centrifugal filter. Tris and azide were avoided
because they interfere with conjugation of antibody to CNBr-activated
Sepharose.

Cross-linking Monoclonals C191 and B2 18-5
to CNBr-Activated
Sepharose
A 5 mg aliquot of each monoclonal in buffer free
of Tris and azide was cross-linked to 3.5 mL Sepharose that had been
swollen from 1 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B powder. The dry Sepharose
was hydrated and washed with 13 mL of ice-cold 1 mM HCl followed by
13 mL of ice-cold coupling buffer, 0.15 M NaHCO3, 0.5 M
NaCl pH 8. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the liquid
discarded before addition of 5 mg monoclonal in 1 mL PBS and 1 mL
coupling buffer. The tubes were rotated at room temperature for 20
h. It was estimated that 99% of the antibody bound to Sepharose as
calculated from the observed absorbance of 0.03 at 280 nm in the supernatant
liquid. The beads were washed twice with the coupling buffer, once
with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20 and twice with
PBS 0.05% sodium azide. The 3.5 mL beads coupled to 5 mg monoclonal
were stored in a total volume of 15 mL PBS 0.05% azide at 4 °C.
A 0.1 mL suspension has 33 μg monoclonal bound to 23 μL
beads.

Pure HuBChE
Cohn fraction IV-4, a byproduct of the
human plasma fractionation industry, was the starting material for
purifying large quantities of HuBChE.10,11 HuBChE was
purified from frozen Cohn fraction IV-4 paste using anion-exchange
chromatography on Q-Ceramic HyperD F sorbent followed by affinity
chromatography on hupresin. Hupresin was recently introduced as a
new affinity gel for purification of rHuBChE expressed in insect cells.12

Human Plasma
Pooled human plasma
from the Nebraska
Medical Center Blood Bank contained acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant.

Heat Inactivation of Pure Human HuBChE
Pure plasma-derived
HuBChE was diluted with PBS 0.1% azide to an activity of 27.5 u/mL
and a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. 1 mL aliquots of HuBChE
were stored at 4, 24, 37, and 45 °C. The 100 °C sample was
prepared by heating a 1 mL aliquot in a boiling water bath for 5 min,
a procedure that completely destroyed HuBChE activity with butyrylthiocholine.
The boiled HuBChE was stored at 4 °C. The stability of HuBChE
activity was measured as a function of time of storage in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Stability of pure HuBChE
in PBS 10 mM azide. Pure HuBChE with an
activity at time zero of 27.5 units/mL and a protein concentration
of 0.055 mg/mL was incubated in 1 mL aliquots at various temperatures.
HuBChE activity was monitored for 43 days. Triplicate assays were
performed at each time point.

Inactivation of HuBChE in Human Plasma at 45 °C
Human
plasma was incubated at 45 °C (113 °F). The loss
of HuBChE activity in plasma was measured as a function of time at
45 °C.

HuBChE Activity
Activity was measured
with 1 mM butyrylthiocholine
iodide in 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0 containing 0.5 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) at 25 °C by recording the increase in absorbance at 412
nm on a Gilford spectrophotometer interfaced to MacLab (ADInstruments,
Colorado Springs, CO). The increase in absorbance between 10 and 40
s was used to calculate units per milliliter where a unit (u) of activity
is micromoles hydrolyzed per minute. The extinction coefficient for
the calculation was 13.6 mM–1 cm–1.13

Gel Shift Assay
The complex formed between monoclonal
B2 18-5 and heat-inactivated pure HuBChE was visualized on a nondenaturing
4–30% gradient polyacrylamide gel, overlaid with a 4% stacking
gel, and stained with Coomassie blue. The samples were prepared for
nondenaturing gel electrophoresis by incubating 10 μL of pure
HuBChE (0.48 mg/mL) with either 5 or 2 μL of monoclonal B2 18-5
(0.91 mg/mL) adjusted to 15 μL with PBS, at room temperature
for 2 h. A 15 μL aliquot of 60% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue
was added to each tube before the samples were loaded on a nondenaturing
gel. Electrophoresis at 300 V (constant voltage) was conducted for
24 h at 4 °C in a Hoefer gel apparatus. The gel shift assay is
shown in Figure 3.

Activity Stained Gel
A nondenaturing 4–30% gradient
gel was stained for HuBChE activity by the method of Karnovsky and
Roots,14 as shown in Figure 4.

Capture of Heat-Inactivated Pure HuBChE by
Immobilized Monoclonals
The selective removal of partly unfolded
HuBChE by immobilized
B2 18-5 and of completely denatured HuBChE by immobilized C191 was
visualized on a nondenaturing 4–30% gradient gel stained with
Coomassie blue. The Sepharose beads in 0.3 mL suspension of immobilized
B2 18-5 or C191 occupied a volume of 70 μL after the liquid
phase was discarded. Pure HuBChE in PBS 0.1% azide at a concentration
of 0.48 mg/mL had been stored at 4 or 45 °C or boiled in a 100
°C water bath and then stored at 4 °C. A 30 μL aliquot
of pure HuBChE was added to the beads and mixed in a rotating mixer
for 5 h at room temperature. A 10 μL aliquot of the clear supernatant
was removed from each incubation mixture for gel electrophoresis on
a nondenaturing gradient gel stained with Coomassie blue to visualize
bands not captured by the monoclonals. The method was used in Figure 6.

The beads
were washed with detergent-containing buffer (PBS with 1% Triton X-100,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 10 mM sodium azide, HCl adjusted to pH 6.5), and the
bound protein was released with 50% acetonitrile 1% trifluoroacetyl
(TFA). The method was used for the SDS gel in Figure 7.

Dynamic Light Scattering
The size
of the pure HuBChE
samples stored at 4, 45 °C or boiled at 100 °C was measured
on the Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern,
UK) in disposable folded capillary cells (DTS1070) for 0.1 mL aliquots
of 0.5 mg/mL of HuBChE in PBS. Measurements at 25 °C were repeated
three times for a total of 42 scans per sample.

Capture of
Heat-Inactivated HuBChE from Human Plasma Stored
at 45 °C
Human plasma (1 mL) stored at 45 °C for
14 days lost 60% of its original HuBChE activity and developed a heavy
precipitate. The liquid and solid phases were treated separately.
The 0.85 mL plasma in the liquid phase was clarified through a 0.45
μm nylon syringe filter before a 0.7 mL aliquot of the filtered
plasma was incubated with a mixture of 0.2 mL immobilized B2 18-5
and 0.2 mL immobilized C191. It was estimated that each 0.2 mL suspension
contained 66 μg monoclonals conjugated to 46 μL beads.
The samples were rotated at room temperature overnight. The beads
were transferred to a 0.45 μm centrifugal filter where they
were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and two
times with water.

HuBChE in the 45 °C plasma pellet was
partly solubilized with 400 μL of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at
37 °C overnight. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold with PBS
before addition of 0.2 mL immobilized B2 18-5 and 0.2 mL immobilized
C191 suspensions. The samples were mixed overnight at room temperature
and washed as above in preparation for Western blotting.

Western Blot
HuBChE immunopurified from human plasma
was visualized on Western blots in Figure 8. Proteins were extracted from immobilized
B2 18-5 and C191 monoclonals with 200 μL of 50% acetonitrile
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The extract was dried, suspended in 5 μL
water and 5 μL Laemmli buffer (0.125 M TrisCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol,
10% 2-mercaptoethanol at pH 6.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue), heated in
a boiling water bath for 3 min, and loaded on an 8% SDS polyacrylamide
gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF
membrane in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine pH 8.3 at 4 °C for 1 h
at 350 mA. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mM
Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20 (TBST with 5% milk) for 1
h, followed by washing three times with TBST. The blot was incubated
at 4 °C overnight with 20 μL monoclonal antibody C191 culture
medium diluted in 10 mL PBS containing 5% milk. The membrane was washed
three times with TBST and incubated 1 h at room temperature with 1
μL antimouse IgG linked to horse radish peroxidase in 5 mL of
TBST containing 5% milk. The membrane was washed with TBST. Bands
were visualized by treating the blot with Clarity Western ECL substrate
and detecting the emitted light on X-ray film. Known quantities of
pure HuBChE were loaded on the SDS gel to serve as controls.

LC-MS/MS
on the 6600 Triple-TOF Mass Spectrometer (AB Sciex)
Mass
spectrometry was used to demonstrate that monoclonal C191
recognizes denatured HuBChE immunopurified from 45 °C heat-treated
plasma. Following incubation with plasma, the beads were transferred
to a 0.45 μm centrifugal filter where they were washed with
a detergent-containing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 20 mM EDTA, and 10 mM NaN3 in PBS adjusted to
pH 6.5) and desalted by washing with water. Proteins captured by immobilized
monoclonal C191 were released with 100 μL of 50% acetonitrile
0.1% TFA, dried, dissolved in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and digested
with trypsin. A 5 μL aliquot of the digest was analyzed using
liquid chromatography (LC)–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Details
of the LC-MS/MS system have been previously described.15

Amino Acid Sequence of Monoclonals C191 and
B2 18-5
The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of
the light and
heavy chains of monoclonals C191 and B2 18-5 were determined by Syd
Labs (Natick, MA) from the mRNA in hybridoma cells. The reported sequences
were validated by testing the specificity of the recombinant monoclonals
produced by transient expression in mammalian cells.

Results
Stability
of Pure HuBChE in PBS at Various Temperatures
The goal was
to identify a temperature and storage time that converts
HuBChE to the type of unfolded, inactive molecule present in plasma
that has been stored at elevated temperatures. Figure 1 shows that solutions of pure HuBChE at a
concentration of 0.05 mg/mL were stable at 4 and 24 °C for at
least 43 days. Storage at 37 °C resulted in a slow loss of HuBChE
activity with time; the activity after 14 days at 37 °C was 87%
and after 43 days was 70% of the initial activity. Storage at 45 °C
resulted in a loss of 50% of the HuBChE activity in 2.5 days and 95%
loss in 14 days. Pure HuBChE that had been denatured in a boiling
water bath (100 °C) had no activity following heat treatment.

Plasma Stored at Elevated Temperatures
Human plasma
in anticoagulant citrate dextrose lost HuBChE activity when the plasma
was incubated at the elevated temperature of 45 °C (113 °F). Figure 2 shows that after
8 days at 45 °C, the HuBChE activity in plasma was 50% of its
initial activity. After 19 days at 45 °C, the plasma lost 75%
of its initial activity, and after 39 days, it lost 93% of its initial
HuBChE activity.

Figure 2 Loss of HuBChE activity in human plasma stored at 45 °C.
Values
for triplicate assays are too close to show up in error bars.

After a chemical emergency, researchers
may be required to analyze
plasma samples that have been stored at temperatures as high as 45
°C. The methods published to date use HuBChE in plasma samples
that are stored frozen or refrigerated. The loss of HuBChE activity
in samples stored at 45 °C suggests the HuBChE protein has undergone
unfolding and that the unfolded HuBChE protein may require the use
of an antibody directed to denatured HuBChE.

Folding States of HuBChE
Antibody binding and gel electrophoresis
experiments described below showed that pure HuBChE incubated at 45
°C contains inactive HuBChE structures in addition to fully active,
native HuBChE. A partly unfolded HuBChE structure and an aggregated
HuBChE structure are recognized by monoclonal B2 18-5, the same monoclonal
that captures native HuBChE. The completely denatured HuBChE is recognized
by monoclonal C191. Table 1 presents the monoclonals that distinguish the folding states
of heat-inactivated HuBChE and the methods to produce these folding
states. Table 1 does
not include plasma heated to 100 °C because plasma congeals to
a solid form at 100 °C, a condition not amenable to antibody-binding
assays.

Table 1 HuBChE Folding States Distinguished

a Storage at 45 °C produces a
mixture of HuBChE folding states including native, partly unfolded,
aggregated, and completely unfolded HuBChE structures.

Gel Shift Assay
The gel shift assay
in Figure 3 demonstrates that storage of pure HuBChE in PBS azide
at
45 °C for 9 days with 55% loss of activity creates HuBChE structures
that differ from native and boiled HuBChE. The nondenaturing gel compares
the migration of pure HuBChE stored at 4 °C (lane 1), 45 °C
(lane 2), and 100 °C (lane 3). The HuBChE tetramer stored at
4 °C has a single band (lane 1), whereas the 45 °C heat-inactivated
HuBChE (lane 2) has bands for native and partly unfolded, a faint
band corresponding to boiled HuBChE, and a diffuse band near the top
of the gel for aggregated HuBChE. The boiled HuBChE (lane 3) has an
intense band that migrates further toward the positive pole than the
native HuBChE tetramer, and in addition has diffuse aggregated bands
near the top of the gel and a faint band slightly above the native
tetramer band. The fastest migrating band in lane 2 (which is barely
detectable in lane 2 but visible in lane 6) is at the position of
boiled HuBChE in lane 3, suggesting that some of the 45 °C heat-inactivated
HuBChE is completely denatured.

Figure 3 Gel shift assay on a nondenaturing 4–30%
gradient gel with
4% stacking gel, stained with Coomassie blue. (1) Pure HuBChE tetramer
stored at 4 °C has a single band. (2) Pure HuBChE stored at 45
°C has a band for native HuBChE, a faster migrating band for
unfolded HuBChE, a barely detectable band at the level of boiled HuBChE,
and a diffuse slow-moving band for aggregated forms. (3) Boiled pure
HuBChE has a prominent band that migrates faster than the unfolded
band in lane 2; in addition boiled HuBChE has several diffuse aggregated
bands. (4) Monoclonal B2 18-5 migrates faster toward the positive
pole than HuBChE. (5) Monoclonal B2 18-5 forms a complex with native
4 °C HuBChE seen as prominent bands near the top of the gel;
lane 5 shows no unbound HuBChE. (6) B2 18-5 forms a complex with native
and partially unfolded HuBChE in the 45 °C sample but does not
form a complex with boiled HuBChE. (7) B2 18-5 does not bind any of
the protein forms in boiled HuBChE. (8) 1.8 μg monoclonal B2
18-5 is saturated by 4.4 μg native HuBChE, forming additional
complexes compared to those in lane 5. (9) 1.8 μg antibody captured
all of the native, partially unfolded, and aggregated HuBChE in the
45 °C sample but not the structure representing boiled HuBChE.
(10) 1.8 μg antibody did not capture boiled HuBChE. The direction
of migration was toward the positive pole, indicated by the + sign.

Figure 3 lane 5
shows that 4.5 μg of monoclonal B2 18-5 shifts the migration
of 4.4 μg native HuBChE to slower moving bands near the top
of the gel. This ratio of monoclonal to HuBChE protein captures all
the
HuBChE. The IgG monoclonal has two antigen-binding domains per molecule.
The HuBChE tetramer has four antibody binding sites per tetramer,
enabling it to form a polymer-like complex that cross-links several
HuBChE tetramers through interaction with two or more monoclonals.
The bands at the top of lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9 probably represent such
high molecular weight complexes. When the HuBChE (4.4 μg) concentration
exceeds the antibody concentration (1.8 μg) as in lane 8, the
cross-linking may be minimized to yield lower molecular weight complexes
where one HuBChE tetramer binds only one or two antibodies. The two
bands in lane 8 that are missing from lane 5 may represent one HuBChE
tetramer bound to one or two antibodies.

Figure 3 lane 6
shows that 4.5 μg of monoclonal B2 18-5 shifts the migration
of bands corresponding to native and partly unfolded tetramers in
45 °C heat-inactivated HuBChE, but does not shift the band that
corresponds to boiled HuBChE. Lane 7 confirms that B2 18-5 does not
recognize completely denatured HuBChE. We conclude that native, partly
unfolded, and aggregated HuBChE structures bind to B2 18-5. However,
completely denatured HuBChE does not bind to B2 18-5.

The gel
in Figure 3 has a stacking
gel on top of a 4–30% acrylamide gradient.
Electrophoresis was performed for 24 h at 300 V constant voltage in
a Hoefer apparatus. This system separated the unbound antibody (lane
4) from unbound HuBChE tetramers (lane 1). However, when the same
samples were run on a precast 4–20% gradient gel (no stacking
gel), the unbound HuBChE migrated to the same position as the unbound
antibody.

Low Activity in the Partly Unfolded HuBChE
The epitope
for binding monoclonal B2 18-5 was present in native, partly unfolded
HuBChE and in aggregated HuBChE produced at 45 °C but was absent
in completely denatured HuBChE. This means that the epitope is formed
by a three-dimensional arrangement of residues, rather than by adjacent
residues in a linear segment. To determine
which folding states of HuBChE have HuBChE activity, the samples were
subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis in Figure 4B, where the gel was stained for HuBChE activity. For comparison,
the gel in Figure 4A was stained with Coomassie blue to show the location of HuBChE
bands in pure HuBChE stored at 4, 45 °C and boiled at 100 °C.
Lanes 4 and 5 in Figure 4B show an intense band of activity for the native HuBChE tetramer.
The 45 °C sample in lane 5 has faint bands of activity for the
unfolded and aggregated HuBChE. The boiled HuBChE sample in lane 6
had no activity. It was concluded that the partly unfolded HuBChE
and aggregated HuBChE structures produced by storage at 45 °C
have a very low level of HuBChE activity. Furthermore, the aggregated
forms that have HuBChE activity in the sample stored at 45 °C
have a different structure than the aggregated forms in boiled HuBChE
that have no HuBChE activity.

Figure 4 Low HuBChE activity in unfolded HuBChE. The
nondenaturing gradient
gel in panel A stained with Coomassie blue was loaded with 4.4 μg
HuBChE protein per lane. The gel in panel B stained for HuBChE activity
was loaded with 0.005 units of HuBChE activity, which required 0.01
μg of HuBChE protein for the 4 °C sample and 0.04 μg
HuBChE protein for the 45 °C sample. The 100 °C sample had
no activity.

HuBChE Aggregates to 30
times Normal Size
The size
of pure HuBChE stored at elevated temperatures was estimated by dynamic
light scattering (DLS). The mean diameter of the 340 kDa HuBChE tetramer
was 20 nm for HuBChE stored at 4 °C (see Figure 5), 18 nm for HuBChE stored at 45 °C,
and 17 nm for boiled HuBChE. The broad peak for pure HuBChE is attributed
to microheterogeneity of the 36 asparagine-linked glycans in the 340
kDa tetramer. The storage of pure HuBChE in PBS azide for 9 days at
45 °C converted 20% of the HuBChE to aggregates with a diameter
of 490 nm. Boiling converted 5% of HuBChE to aggregates with a diameter
of 100 nm and 45% of HuBChE to aggregates with a mean diameter of
620 nm.

Figure 5 DLS of pure HuBChE stored at 4 and 45 °C and boiled at 100
°C. The 4 °C sample consists predominantly of 340 kDa HuBChE
tetramers with an average diameter of 20 nm. Heat treatment produces
aggregates with an average diameter of 500–600 nm.

DLS did not resolve HuBChE into the bands visualized
by nondenaturing
gel electrophoresis. For example, the most intense band in boiled
HuBChE (Figure 3, lane
3) migrates further than the band in 4 °C HuBChE (Figure 3, lane 1). This difference
is not apparent in Figure 5. Coomassie blue staining of the nondenaturing gel in Figure 3 showed only faint
bands for aggregated HuBChE in the 100 °C sample, whereas DLS
indicated that 50% of the HuBChE had aggregated. Both methods agree
that heating under our conditions produces high molecular weight aggregates,
but does not fragment the HuBChE protein into smaller peptides.

Nondenaturing Gel Shows HuBChE Bands Not Captured by B2 18-5
and C191
A second approach for demonstrating the specificity
of monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191 used nondenaturing gel electrophoresis
to show the bands of pure HuBChE that failed to bind to immobilized
antibodies. In Figure 6, lane 4 is blank, which means all the native
4 °C pure HuBChE was captured by B2 18-5. In lane 5 for 45 °C
heat-inactivated HuBChE, all bands disappeared (compare lanes 2 and
5), except for a faint band at the position of boiled HuBChE. This
means only native HuBChE, partly unfolded, and aggregated HuBChE are
recognized by B2 18-5. The bands for boiled HuBChE are present in
lane 6, indicating that B2 18-5 does not recognize completely denatured
HuBChE. By contrast, lane 9 is nearly blank, which shows that C191
captured boiled HuBChE. However, C191 did not bind native HuBChE (lane
7) and did not bind the bands in 45 °C HuBChE for native and
partly unfolded HuBChE (lane 8). The nondenaturing gel in Figure 6 shows that 33 μg
immobilized B2 18-5 captured 100% of the 5 μg of native, partially
unfolded, and aggregated HuBChE in 4 and 45 °C samples, whereas
33 μg immobilized C191 captured 99% of the 5 μg boiled
HuBChE. In a previous study,8 we have shown
that 20 μg immobilized monoclonal B2 18-5 captures 97% of the
HuBChE in 0.5 mL human plasma. We expect that B2 18-5 and C191 monoclonals
used together will immunopurify the maximum amount of HuBChE from
human plasma stored at elevated temperatures.

Figure 6 Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis
stained with Coomassie blue.
Pure HuBChE stored at 4 and 45 °C or boiled was incubated with
immobilized B2 18-5 or with immobilized C191. Unbound protein was
loaded on the gel. Lanes 1–3 were loaded with 5 μg pure
HuBChE. Lanes 4–9 show the unbound HuBChE remaining in solution
after incubation of 5 μg HuBChE with 33 μg immobilized
monoclonal.

SDS Gel Confirms the Capture
of Native, Partly Unfolded, and
Aggregated HuBChE by B2 18-5 and the Capture of Completely Unfolded
HuBChE by C191
Pure HuBChE at a concentration of 0.48 mg/mL
in PBS azide lost no activity at 4 °C, lost 60% activity in 15
days at 45 °C, and lost 100% activity in a boiling water bath.
The heat-treated pure HuBChE remained in solution and did not precipitate.
Immobilized monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191 (100 μg monoclonal
bound to 70 μL Sepharose beads) were incubated with 13 μg
of pure HuBChE in 30 μL PBS for 5 h at room temperature. The
beads were washed with detergent-containing buffer, and the bound
protein was released with 50% acetonitrile 1% TFA. Bound HuBChE released
from the immobilized monoclonals is visualized in Figure 7. The SDS gel shows that HuBChE heated to 45 or 100 °C
has the same monomer molecular weight of 85 kDa and dimer of 170 kDa
as HuBChE stored at 4 °C. Thus, heat treatment did not break
peptide bonds. HuBChE (lane 1) stored at 4 °C has a band at 85
kDa, indicating that native HuBChE was bound by monoclonal B2 18-5.
However, there is no HuBChE band in lane 4, indicating that monoclonal
C191 did not bind native HuBChE. The bands for HuBChE are present
in lanes 2 and 5, indicating that HuBChE stored at 45 °C contains
HuBChE folding states captured by both B2 18-5 and C191 monoclonals.
There is no HuBChE band in lane 3, indicating that the boiled HuBChE
is not recognized by B2 18-5. However, there is a HuBChE band in lane
6, indicating that monoclonal C191 binds denatured HuBChE. These results
confirm the binding specificity of B2 18-5 for native, partly unfolded,
and aggregated HuBChE, whereas C191 specifically binds completely
denatured HuBChE. All folding states—native, partly unfolded,
aggregates, and completely unfolded—are present in HuBChE stored
at 45 °C. The use of both antibodies together is expected to
yield the highest amount of immunopurified HuBChE.

Figure 7 HuBChE captured by immobilized
monoclonals was released from binding
and visualized on an SDS gel stained with Coomassie blue. HuBChE stored
at 4 °C was captured by B2 18-5 (lane 1) but not by C191 (lane
4). HuBChE stored at 45 °C was captured by B2 18-5 (lane 2) and
C191 (lane 5). Boiled HuBChE was not captured by B2 18-5 (lane 3)
but was captured by C191 (lane 6).

Monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191 Immunopurify HuBChE from 45 °C
Heat-Inactivated Plasma
Having established that heat-denatured
pure HuBChE remains in solution, and that B2 18-5 and C191 immunopurify
heat-denatured pure HuBChE, we tested these monoclonals for their
ability to immunopurify HuBChE from human plasma stored at 45 °C.
Western blotting was used to detect HuBChE immunopurified from plasma.
Immobilized monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191 were incubated with control
plasma stored at 4 °C or with the supernatant in 45 °C heat-inactivated
plasma. The plasma stored at 45 °C developed a heavy precipitate.
The 4 °C control plasma contained no pellet. The possibility
was tested that HuBChE was trapped in the plasma precipitate. The
pellet was extracted with Triton X-100, and the diluted extract was
incubated with immobilized B2 18-5 and C191. The Western blot in Figure 8A for control plasma (lane 4) indicates a recovery of about
0.5 μg HuBChE from 1 mL control plasma stored at 4 °C.
HuBChE activity in the control plasma was 1.8 u/mL, which corresponds
to 2.5 μg of HuBChE protein. A recovery of 20% HuBChE protein
is therefore expected from heat-inactivated plasma processed through
the immunopurification and Western blotting steps.

Figure 8 (A) Western blot for
HuBChE immunopurified from 1 mL control 4
°C plasma (lane 4) by an equal mixture of immobilized B2 18-5
and C191 indicates a recovery of 20% HuBChE protein, which is based
on the comparison to the pure HuBChE standards in lanes 1–3.
(B) Western blot for HuBChE immunopurified from 45 °C heat-inactivated
plasma by a 1:1 mixture of immobilized B2 18-5 and C191. More HuBChE
was recovered from the supernatant (lane 8) than the pellet (lane
9).

The Western blot in Figure 8B shows HuBChE immunopurified
from plasma stored at 45 °C
for 3 weeks. After 1 mL plasma had been separated from the pellet
and filtered, only 0.7 mL of plasma remained for incubation with immobilized
antibodies. The band intensities in lane 8 correspond to a recovery
of about 0.2 μg of HuBChE protein from 0.7 mL plasma, a percent
recovery similar to that for control plasma in lane 4. Comparison
of band intensities for HuBChE immunopurified from the plasma supernatant
(lane 8) and the pellet (lane 9) shows that the supernatant contained
most of the HuBChE protein. This result for plasma is consistent with
the observation that pure HuBChE remained in solution after prolonged
incubation at 45 °C and after denaturation in a boiling water
bath.

Plasma stored at 45 °C for 2 weeks with a 67% loss
of HuBChE
activity was immunopurified with immobilized B2 18-5. The extracted
protein gave a good HuBChE signal on a Western blot, corresponding
to about 0.2 μg of protein. The same sample immunopurified with
C191 gave a weak signal, corresponding to 0.02 μg of HuBChE.
After 3 weeks at 45 °C, when plasma had lost 80% of its HuBChE
activity, the two monoclonals captured equal amounts of HuBChE proteins.

Mass Spectrometry Confirms that C191 Immunopurifies HuBChE from
Heat-Denatured Plasma
Human plasma stored at 45 °C for
3 weeks with 80% loss of HuBChE activity was incubated with immobilized
C191 monoclonal. Protein released from the washed beads was digested
with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a 6600 Triple-TOF mass spectrometer.
Protein Pilot software identified the HuBChE peptides colored green
and red in Figure 9. Of the 574 amino acids in the mature HuBChE protein, 217 amino
acids were identified in Figure 9 for a coverage of 38%. Mass spectrometry confirmed
the finding from Western blots that monoclonal C191 immunopurifies
HuBChE from heat-inactivated plasma. This means that some of the HuBChE
in plasma stored at 45 °C is completely denatured.

Figure 9 Mass spectrometry
analysis of denatured HuBChE captured by monoclonal
C191 from plasma stored at 45 °C for 3 weeks. Peptides identified
with 99% confidence are colored green, with 50% confidence are colored
red. The accession number for HuBChE is P06276.

Amino Acid Sequences of Monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191
The amino acid sequences of monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191 in Figure 10 were deduced from
the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA. The complementarity-determining
regions (CDRs) are boxed because they are the hypervariable domains
that determine antibody-binding specificity.

of mouse anti-HuBChE monoclonal antibodies B2 18-5, isotype IgG2b
κ, and C191, IgG1 κ. The CDRs were defined using VBASE2 http://www.vbase2.org/.

The nucleotide and amino acid
sequences for monoclonals B2 18-58 and
C191 have been deposited in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information database under the accession
numbers listed in Table 2. Knowledge of the sequences of monoclonals is valuable because it
allows one to produce the monoclonals using recombinant DNA techniques
when the hybridoma cells are unavailable or when the antibody genes
in the hybridoma cells have undergone deleterious mutations.

Discussion
Antibodies
for Immunopurification of Heat-Inactivated HuBChE
from Plasma
Monoclonals B2 18-5 and C191 can be used to immunopurify
heat-inactivated HuBChE in human plasma that has been stored at 45
°C. Monoclonal B2 18-5 recognizes native HuBChE and two HuBChE
conformations that have minimal activity. Monoclonal C191 recognizes
a completely denatured HuBChE structure. The use of these antibodies
in combination is expected to capture 95% of HuBChE from plasma stored
at elevated temperatures, making it possible to determine nerve agent
exposure in plasma stored under nonideal conditions.

Other monoclonal
antibodies to HuBChE can be used in place of B2 18-5 to capture HuBChE
from plasma. Monoclonal HAH 002-01, also called 3E8, from BioPorto
Diagnostics or from Thermo Fisher has been used by the Centers for
Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) and the Federal Medical-Biological
Agency of Russia (St. Petersburg) to immunopurify HuBChE from plasma.1,16 Monoclonal 3E8 has been used in a magnetic electrochemical sensing
platform to monitor exposure to organophosphorus agents.17

Monoclonals mAb2 and B2 12-1 can also
be used to immunopurify HuBChE
from plasma,8 although they are not commercially
available. These antibodies can be made by recombinant DNA methods
using the nucleotide and amino acid sequences we have deposited in
the NCBI database.8

Monoclonals C191
and 11D88,18 are the only monoclonals
that recognize heat-denatured HuBChE. Monoclonal C191 was made against
a boiled and reduced truncated HuBChE monomer called L530stop that
was missing 44 amino acids from the C-terminal tetramerization domain.
The epitope for binding C191 is available not just in denatured monomeric
HuBChE but also in heat-denatured tetrameric and aggregated HuBChE.
Both C191 and 11D8 can be used in Western blots and ELISA. Immunohistochemical
analysis of HuBChE in tissue sections fixed with paraformaldehyde
has been successful with monoclonal 11D818 but has not been studied with C191.

The monoclonals listed
above were created in mice and do not recognize
mouse BChE. However, Mrvova et al.19 created
monoclonals that specifically recognize mouse BChE by immunizing BChE
knockout mice with mouse BChE. Monoclonals B2 18-5 and mAb2 have broad
species specificity, recognizing BChE in plasma of human, monkey,
horse, cat, tiger, and rabbit.20

HuBChE
Has Conformations Distinguishable by Monoclonal Antibodies
Native HuBChE with normal HuBChE activity is recognized by monoclonal
B2 18-5. HuBChE protein with little residual activity due to heat-inactivation
at 45 °C is also recognized by monoclonal B2 18-5. This monoclonal
does not recognize completely misfolded HuBChE produced by heating
a HuBChE solution in a boiling water bath. The selectivity of monoclonal
B2 18-5 for minimally active HuBChE conformations that are different
from the conformations of boiled HuBChE demonstrates the existence
of several misfolded states of HuBChE.

Additional evidence for
more than one misfolded HuBChE structure comes from a study that used
urea-gradient polyacrylamide electrophoresis to show that tetrameric
HuBChE unfolds via several partially unfolded states.21

Folding and Aggregation States of HuBChE
Native HuBChE
in human plasma is a tetramer of four identical subunits. Each subunit
contains 574 amino acids, 3 intrachain disulfide bonds, 1 interchain
disulfide bond, and 9 asparagine-linked glycans. The tetramer is a
dimer of dimers formed by an interchain disulfide bond at Cys 571.22 HuBChE assembles into a tetramer via contact
with polyproline-rich peptides derived from lamellipodin.23−25 The polyproline-rich peptides interact with the tryptophan-rich
C-terminus of HuBChE.26

Pure HuBChE
heated to 100 °C releases its polyproline peptides.23−25 We had expected the boiled HuBChE to dissociate to dimers. However,
the DLS experiment and the nondenaturing gel had no hints of a HuBChE
dimer. It seems the subunits reassembled into tetramers and high molecular
weight aggregates by forming new disulfide bonds and by associating
via hydrophobic interactions. Heat-treated pure HuBChE has been shown
by others to contain high molecular weight aggregates that separate
from the 340 kDa HuBChE tetramer on a size-exclusion chromatography
column.27 Heating pure HuBChE in PBS to
100 °C for 5 min or 45 °C for 9 days did not break peptide
bonds.

The molten globule states of the HuBChE tetramer have
been studied
by subjecting HuBChE to hydrostatic pressure.5 A pressure of 2 kbar irreversibly inactivated HuBChE without significantly
changing its secondary structure. A pressure of 8 kbar completely
unfolded the HuBChE tetramer but did not dissociate the tetramer.
Upon release of pressure, the HuBChE protein formed aggregates with
no catalytic activity. Thus, denaturation by high pressure and denaturation
by high temperature yield similar misfolded HuBChE structures.

Method
to Detect Inactive HuBChE in Pure HuBChE Preparations
The
present study demonstrates a method for detecting inactive
HuBChE in a pure human HuBChE preparation. A preparation free of inactive
HuBChE has a single band on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel stained
with Coomassie blue. However, a preparation containing a significant
proportion of partly denatured HuBChE has multiple bands on a nondenaturing
gel and a lower than expected activity per milligram protein. These
additional bands could be interpreted as originating from contaminating
proteins, when in fact they simply represent inactive HuBChE structures.
Pure HuBChE intended for clinical trials in humans could be tested
for the presence of aggregated HuBChE by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis.
