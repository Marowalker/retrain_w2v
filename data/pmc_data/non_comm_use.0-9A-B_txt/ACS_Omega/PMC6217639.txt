Glycan-binding
molecules, such as lectins, are very important tools
for characterizing, imaging, or targeting glycans and are often involved
in either physiological or pathological processes. However, their
availability is far less compared to the diversity of native glycans.
Therefore, development of lectin mimetics with desired specificity
and affinity is in high demand. Boronic acid reacts with 1,2- and
1,3-diols of saccharides in aqueous media through reversible boronate
ester formation and are regarded as synthetic lectin mimetics. In
this study, bovine serum albumin (BSA)–phenylboronic acid (PBA)
conjugates were synthesized in a density-controlled manner by targeting
both aspartic and glutamic acids to afford lectin mimetics with multivalent
PBA, as multivalency is a key factor for glycan recognition in both
specificity and affinity. The resultant BSA–PBA conjugates
were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry analysis. Their macrophage cell surface glycan-binding
capacity was characterized by a competitive lectin-binding assay examined
by flow cytometry, and 3-(4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay showed biocompatibility. These novel lectin mimetics
will find a broad range of applications as they can be wittingly modified,
altering binding specificity and capacity.

Introduction
Carbohydrate recognition is a crucial
event in many biological
processes.1 For example, cell surface glycans,
existing as glycoproteins, glycolipids, or proteoglycans, are involved
in a variety of biological processes, including cellular adhesion,
cell signaling, cell–cell communication, and immune response.2−4 Cell surface glycans are highly associated with disease development,
such as inflammation and cancer.5,6 Overexpression of cell
surface glycans is confirmed in cancer cells compared to healthy cells
used as a control.7 Therefore, sensitive
profiling of cell surface glycans is highly demanded for basic glycomic
advancement, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic applications. In
fact, the diversity and complexity of glycan structures, together
with their crucial role in many physiological or pathological processes,
require the development of new techniques for analysis. Lectins are
carbohydrate-binding proteins having at least one noncatalytic domain
that binds reversibly to a specific carbohydrate.8 Due to their specificity, they have been employed to identify
cell surface glycans and glycoconjugates. Fluorescently labeled lectins
have been widely used as intracellular and extracellular labels for
cellular glycan profiling.9−11 Further, lectin arrays using
lectins as probes are well established to determine specific glycan
markers among different cell populations.12 In addition, lectins are also used for cellular targeting, showing
promise in biomedical applications, including targeting of apoptotic
and autophagic pathways useful in anticancer therapies.13 Although natural lectins are very important
tools for glycoscience research and application, they also have major
limitations, such as difficulty in production, instability toward
rigorous use, high cost, and lack of availability.14 Another limiting factor is low binding affinity and specificity
leading to poor sensitivity for analytical assays because rarely is
any glycan found at high abundance in a biological sample.15 In an effort to mitigate these limitations,
clustered or linked lectins have been explored because of the important
role of multivalency in glycan–protein interactions.16,17

Boronic acids (BAs) react with 1,2- and 1,3-diols of saccharides
in aqueous media through reversible boronate ester formation.18−20 This interaction has been explored for potential applications in
the analysis of glycans and glycoconjugates. So far, BA-containing
ligands have been employed as artificial carbohydrate receptors,21,22 membrane transport agents,22 and cell
surface carbohydrate recognition ligands.23 It has been reported that phenylboronic acid (PBA) can selectively
bind to the glycerol side chain of sialic acids (SAs) under physiological
conditions, and the complex is stabilized through coordination of
the amide NH or CO located at the C-5 position of SAs.24 This anomalous binding profile of PBA strongly
suggests an innovative molecular targeting platform for selective
recognition of cell surface SA residues of both glycoproteins and
glycolipids. To further investigate the glycan-binding ability of
multivalent lectin mimetics, we designed protein–PBA conjugates
to elucidate cell surface SA capabilities and evaluate their application
as synthetic lectin mimetics. Specifically, bovine serum albumin (BSA)–PBA
conjugates were synthesized in a density-controlled manner by targeting
both aspartic and glutamic acids to afford the lectin mimetics with
multivalent PBA, as multivalence is a key factor for glycan–protein
binding in both specificity and affinity. The resultant BSA–PBA
conjugates were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. Further,
its cell surface glycan-binding capacity was confirmed by competitive
lectin-binding assay examined by flow cytometry.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of BSA–PBA Conjugates
Considering
PBA’s ability to reversibly bind 1,2- and 1,3-diols
in aqueous media along with BSA’s well-tolerated and widespread
application, BSA–PBA conjugates were designed as lectin mimetics
and were synthesized via N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling. In this
instance, amidation of carboxylic acids in BSA was followed by conjugation
with 3-aminophenylboronic acid in the presence of EDC dissolved in
2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic (MES) buffer (Scheme 1). The resultant
BSA–PBA conjugates were purified on a Hi-Trap Sephadex G-25
column by using diH2O as eluent. Different densities of
BSA–PBA conjugates were synthesized by altering the ratio of
PBA to BSA.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of BSA–PBA Conjugates
The resultant BSA–PBA conjugates were
characterized by SDS-PAGE
gel with Coomassie blue and Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining assay. First,
BSA–PBA conjugates were characterized by SDS-PAGE, where they
showed an increase in molecular weight (Figure 1A). ARS binds to PBA in a 1:1 ratio, and
a dramatic change in color and UV–vis and fluorescent absorption
spectra can be monitored. Therefore, the BSA–PBA conjugates
characterized on SDS-PAGE were stained with ARS. As shown in Figure 1B, clear yellowish
spots of all three BSA–PBA conjugates were observed, but not
for unmodified BSA. In the same respect, fluorescent signals were
obtained for all three BSA–PBA conjugates, but not for the
BSA on the gel under fluorescence scanner (Figure 1C). These data confirmed that the BSA–PBA
conjugates were successfully synthesized.

EDC coupling of BSA to 3-PBA. (A) All protein
bands visualized by Coomassie blue staining. (B) BSA–PBA bands

bands stained with ARS (M: protein molecular weight marker; BSA: bovine
serum albumin; 1: BSA–PBA1; 2: BSA–PBA2; and 3: BSA–PBA3).

Next, MALDI-TOF MS was used to
characterize the BSA–PBA
conjugates using a sinapic acid matrix with a Bruker Autoflex III
mass spectrometer. The mass spectrum acquired for unmodified BSA showed
the typical profile of a nonglycosylated, nonfunctionalized protein.
The molecular ion peak was broadly dispersed over 66 430 Da
due to an isotopic effect relative to the size of the protein (Figure 2A). The m/z ratio increases and peak position shifts to the
right as BSA functionalized with PBA and the amount of shift is directly
correlated to the amount of PBA conjugated to BSA (Figure 2A(2,3,4)). As a result, three
BSA–PBA conjugates were obtained with the PBA/BSA ratio increase
in the reactions, affording BSA–PBA1 determined to have 5 PBA
functionalities, BSA–PBA2 to have 10 PBA, and BSA–PBA3
to have 15 PBA functionalities. The MALDI-TOF MS spectra of BSA (1)
and BSA mixed with PBA in different ratios but without EDC (Figure 2B(2–4)) showed
no molecular weight change, indicating no PBA conjugation occurred.
These data further confirmed that the BSA–PBA conjugates were
successfully synthesized.

and (2–4) BSA mixed with PBA in different ratios but without

Carbohydrate-Binding Capacity
of BSA–PBA Conjugates
The carbohydrate-binding capacity
of BSA–PBA conjugates
was examined by ARS displacement assay, which has been used extensively
to quantify boronic acid and carbohydrate-binding capabilities.25−27 Briefly, ARS shows a color change from red to yellow when bound
to BSA–PBA and shifts the UV absorption wavelength from 520
to 460 nm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). When adding
a (0.1 M) fructose, the fructose–boronic acid complex forms,
releasing ARS with the color changing from yellow back to red and
the wavelength shifting back to 520 nm (Figure 3B).

Silica beads have been widely used as small, rigid
particles for
high-performance affinity chromatography and are capable of withstanding
high flow rates and/or pressures. Recently, surface-functionalized
silica beads have received widespread attention for affinity chromatography
applications.28,29 In the present study, BSA–PBA
conjugates were immobilized onto maleimide-functionalized silica beads,
and their respective carbohydrate-binding affinity and specificity
were investigated. First, BSA–PBA was dissolved in 0.1 mM PBS
(pH 7.4). This BSA–PBA solution was added to commercially available
maleimide-functionalized silica beads (Sigma) and the thiol–maleimide
coupling reaction was allowed at room temperature for 4 h. Then, the
unreacted BSA–PBA was removed by washing the silica beads with
0.1 mM PBS (pH 7.4) three times to afford BSA–PBA-functionalized
silica beads (SB–BSA–PBA). Then, the resultant SB–BSA–PBA
was characterized by ARS binding assays compared to BSA-modified silica
beads and untreated maleimide-functionalized silica beads as well.
As a result, SB–BSA–PBA incubated with ARS solution
showed strong ARS binding compared to unmodified silica beads and
BSA-modified silica beads incubated with the same ARS solution.

Next, the SB–BSA–PBA was used to evaluate the carbohydrate-binding
affinity and specificity by ARS displacement assay. First, SB–BSA–PBA
(15 mg) was incubated with ARS (0.1 μM) in PBS (pH 7.4) at room
temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing
unreacted ARS was removed by a pipette and the silica beads were washed
three times with PBS (pH 7.4). Among the BSA–PBA conjugates
used, the BSA–PBA3-modified silica beads displayed the highest
binding of ARS, as it has higher density of PBA compared to BSA–PBA1
and BSA–PBA2 (Figure 4). The BSA-modified silica beads and silica gel beads alone
showed no ARS released and were subtracted as controls during the
experiment. To support this evidence, ARS displacement by the introduction
of a high concentration (0.1 M) of saccharides was investigated. This
method has been used in the past to determine multiple facets of PBA
binding to include saccharide kinetics, affinity, and specificity.30 The ARS-bound SB–BSA–PBA was incubated
with free monosaccharides solution (0.1 M) in PBS (pH 7.4) at room
temperature for 30 min to displace the bound ARS from the SB–BSA–PBA.
In addition, their O-methyl glycosides of all sugars
were investigated, and O-methyl glycosides mimic
the native form of sugars in glycan chains linked via O-glycosylation. The displaced ARS was subjected to UV–vis
spectroscopy, and the corresponding absorbance data were in direct
correlation with the amount of ARS released from the SB–BSA–PBA,
which is the indicator of the binding affinity and specificity of
BSA–PBA conjugates to free monosaccharides and their O-methyl glycosides. As a result, BSA–PBA3 conjugates
with the highest density of PBA showed the highest binding capacity
for both free monosaccharides and their O-methyl
glycosides compared to BSA–PBA1- and BSA–PBA2-modified
silica beads (Figure 4). However, there was no significant difference observed regarding
specificity for both monosaccharides and their O-methyl
glycosides. This result indicates that the SB–BSA–PBA
binding is dependent on the number of PBAs on BSA, but it is unknown
based on this assay if the saccharide truly makes a difference.

Figure 4 Carbohydrate-binding
capacity of BSA–PBA measured by ARS
replacement assay immobilized on silica gel beads. BSA–PBA
conjugates were immobilized onto maleimide-functionalized silica gel,
incubated with ARS, followed by washing and incubation with monosaccharides
and their O-methyl glycoside. Absorbance at 520 nm
was recorded for the free ARS replaced by sugars from the beads (sialic
acid: Neu5Ac, sialoside: 2-α-O-Methyl glycoside
of Neu5Ac).

Evaluation of Biocompatibility
of BSA–PBA Conjugates
The relative cytotoxicity of
BSA–PBA conjugates toward Raw
264.7 cells was estimated by an 3-(4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) viability assay. Briefly, Raw 264.7 cells were seeded
into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 per well
in 200 μL of medium. After 24 h of incubation, the culture medium
was removed and replaced with 200 μL of media containing serial
dilutions of BSA–PBA conjugates. The cells were grown for another
24 h. Then, 200 μL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT assay stock solution, in
phenol red free medium, was added to each well. After incubating the
cells for 4 h, the medium having unreacted dye was removed carefully.
The obtained purple formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μL
SDS-HCl per well, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. As a
result, no apparent cytotoxicity to Raw 264.7 cells was observed up
to a high concentration of 1 μM for all three BSA–PBA
conjugates. Instead, certain level of cell proliferation was observed
for higher concentration of the three BSA–PBA conjugates (Figure 5).

cells were incubated with BSA, PBA, and BSA–PBA
conjugates for 24 h at 37 °C. The error bars represent one standard
deviation of the averaged cell percent viability (n = 3).

(5 μg/mL), followed by MAA and SNA lectin (10 μg/mL).
The error bars indicate one standard deviation of the averaged fluorescence
intensity (n = 3).

Evaluation of Cell Surface Glycan-Binding Capability of BSA–PBA
Conjugates
SAs are found linked to galactose residues by
either α-2,3 or α-2,6 linkage on the cell surface.31 In this study, the binding capacity of BSA–PBA
conjugates to cell surface SA was determined via competitive inhibition
of the binding of lectins that specifically recognize SA by flow cytometry
analysis. First, Raw 264.7 cells were incubated with BSA–PBA
conjugates for 90 min, followed by incubation with MAA-FITC and SNA-FITC,
which specifically bind to α-2,3 and α-2,6-linked SAs,
respectively.32 From the flow cytometry
study (Figure 6), MAA-FITC
showed very strong binding compared to SNA-FITC on the cell surface
of Raw 264.7 cells, cultured under the normal condition. And it was
apparent that BSA–PBA could inhibit binding of MAA-FITC by
blocking available binding sites with respect to the number of PBA
residues available from BSA–PBA for interaction. SNA-FITC,
on the other hand, showed a drastic decrease in binding when incubated
with BSA–PBA1 cells, followed by an increase in fluorescence
intensities with BSA–PBA2 and BSA–PBA3, which have high
PBA content. This inverse relationship may be due to PBA location
or geometry is different in these three BSA–PBA conjugates
and their ability to bind cell surface SAs may be different, thereby
having different inhibition capacities for SNA binding. It is known
that MAA and SNA specifically bind to α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked
SAs as they have different binding sites and different SA geometry
preferences.32 It may also be possible
that BSA–PBA2 and BSA–PBA3 may induce more expression
of α-2,6-linked SAs, resulting in an increase in the fluorescence
intensity of the SNA-FITC. This phenomenon is correlated to the MTT
assay data (Figure 5), in which BSA–PBA2 and BSA–PBA3 conjugates were able
to proliferate the concentration of cells. To confirm all of these
speculations, we plan to design more BSA–PBA conjugates and
characterize their PBA conjugation location and quantify cell surface
SA expression of macrophage upon incubation with these lectin mimetics
in detail in our future study. To explain the reduction in fluorescence
intensity caused by the BSA control, it is possible that the BSA may
limit this effect, showing true 100% lectin binding.

Conclusions
BSA–PBA conjugates were successfully synthesized, and their
glycan recognition has been demonstrated as lectin mimetics. The conjugates
were synthesized in a density-controlled manner using traditional
EDC coupling, affording amide derivatives from carboxylic acid residues
within the BSA. The BSA–PBA conjugates were characterized by
SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. The BSA–PBA conjugates were immobilized
onto maleimide-functionalized silica gel via thiol–maleimide
interactions and used to study the sugar-binding capacity by ARS displacement
assay. Evaluation of biocompatibility using an MTT assay showed no
effect on cell viability after 24 h. Finally, cellular studies confirmed
the binding of BSA–PBA conjugates to the cell surface SA of
Raw 264.7 cells based on the inhibition of lectin–FITC binding.
These lectin mimetics have more favorable properties compared to natural
lectin in terms of toxicity and inherent immunogenicity and will provide
a valuable tool for future glycomics, biosensor, and immunomodulation
research and applications.

Experimental Section

All solvents and reagents
were purchased from commercial sources and were used as received,
unless otherwise noted. Deionized water was used as a solvent in all
procedures. 3-Aminophenylboronic acid, Alizarin Red S (ARS), BSA, N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide,
3-(4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT),
and maleimide-functionalized silica beads and Sephadex G-25 were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Glucose, methyl β-O-glucopyranoside, galactose, methyl β-O-galactopyranoside, mannose, methyl α-O-mannopyranoside,
sialic acid, and lactose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). MAA-FITC and SNA-FITC were purchased from Bio-World (Dublin,
OH). 2-α-O-Methyl glycoside of Neu5Ac was synthesized
by a literature method.33

Synthesis of
BSA–PBA Conjugates
BSA (100 mg,
30 μM) and 3-aminophenylboronic acid (30 mg, 400 mM) were dissolved
in 5 mL of 0.05 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic
acid buffer (MES; pH 6.0). To this mixture, N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; 15 mg, 80 μM)
was added under constant stirring and allowed to react overnight at
room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was subjected to a Sephadex
G-25 column with diH2O as eluent for purification and lyophilized.
BSA–PBAs of different densities were prepared using the same
procedure as above by changing the ratios of BSA to PBA. Characterization
was carried out by SDS-PAGE using both Coomassie blue and ARS as stains
and imaged on a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager.

Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption Ionization/Time-of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
The high purities and expected
structures of the conjugated BSA–PBA derivatives were verified
by MALDI-TOF MS using a Bruker Autoflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.
The sample was applied onto the target plate using the dry droplet
technique, in which 1 μL of sample containing 1 μg of
total protein in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was mixed with 1
μL of matrix (20 mg/mL sinappic acid in 0.1% TFA, 40% acetonitrile).
The spots were dried at room temperature to allow sample crystallization
prior to insertion into the instrument, and the spectrum was obtained
in linear mode.

Immobilization of BSA–PBA onto Silica
Beads
BSA–PBA (45 mg, 2 mM) and maleimide-functionalized
silica
beads (250 mg) were incubated in PBS (3 mL, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 4 h
at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged and
washed with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) three times to remove unreacted BSA–PBA.
The same procedure was used for immobilization of all BSA–PBA
conjugates as well as unmodified BSA.

Alizarin Red S Binding
and Displacement Assay of BSA–PBA
on Silica Beads
BSA–PBA-modified silica beads (15
mg) were incubated with ARS (400 μM) in PBS (1 mL, 0.1 M, pH
7.4) for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged to remove unreacted
ARS. The beads were then centrifuged and washed with 0.1 M PBS (pH
7.4) three times to remove unreacted or loosely bound ARS, followed
by incubation of these silica beads with 100 mM sugar solutions (glucose,
methyl β-O-glucopyranoside, galactose, methyl
β-O-galactopyranoside, mannose, methyl α-O-mannopyranoside, Neu5Ac, 2-α-O-methyl
glycoside of Neu5Ac, and lactose) in 0.1 M PBS (1 mL, pH 7.4) for
30 min at room temperature. Supernatant containing displaced ARS was
removed after centrifugation and subjected to UV–vis spectroscopy.
The absorbance of each well was measured on a microplate reader (Molecular
Devices Spectrometer Plus 384) at 520 nm.

Cell Culture Methods
Raw 264.7 cells (ATCC) were cultured
using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptavidin at 37 °C
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Subculture was performed
when the cells had 80–90% confluence using trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid.

MTT Assay
The biocompatibility of the BSA–PBA
conjugates was measured by 3-(4, 5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Raw 264.7 cells (ATCC) were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in medium
and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C (5% CO2). After 24
h, the medium was replaced with a new medium, supplemented with BSA–PBA
conjugates, at varying concentrations (0.062, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and
1 μM). After an additional 24 h, the cell medium was again removed
and 100 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT solution was added to each well, and
the plates were incubated for 4 h. The MTT solution was removed and
100 μL of 1SDS-HCl per well was added to solubilize the precipitate,
and the plates were shaken for 10 min. The absorbance of each well
was measured on a microplate reader at 520 nm.

Competitive Inhibition
of Lectin Binding to Macrophage Cell
Surface SA by Flow Cytometry Analysis
Raw 264.7 cells were
seeded at 4 × 105 cells/well (5 mL tubes) and treated
with BSA–PBA conjugates for 90 min. The cells were then washed
three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.2 mL, pH 7.4)
and suspended in 50 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing MAA-FITC (10
μg/mL) or SNA-FITC (10 μg/mL). After incubation for 30
min at room temperature, the cells were washed with cold PBS (pH 7.4)
three times and resuspended in 500 μL of the same buffer for
flow analysis. A minimum of 10 000 cells were measured each
time. The fluorescence intensity of fluorescein-labeled lectins was
subtracted from the intensity of the cell–lectin complex. All
experiments were carried out in triplicate and spectra were obtained
on a BD FACSCanto II Flow Cytometer.
