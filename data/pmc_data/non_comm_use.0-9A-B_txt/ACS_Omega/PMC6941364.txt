Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) were prepared
from chitosan
through a hydrothermal reaction. When ethanol precipitation was used
as the purification method, a high product yield of 85.3% was obtained.
A strong blue fluorescence emission with a high quantum yield (QY)
of 6.6% was observed from the NCQD aqueous solution. Physical and
chemical characteristics of the NCQDs were carefully investigated
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and transient fluorescence spectra. Experimental
results showed that diameters of the NCQDs were in the range of 2–10
nm. The carbon quantum dots possess good water dispersibility and
precipitation by ethanol. When used for metal ion detection, the detection
limit of the NCQDs for Fe3+ was as low as 1.57 μM.
This work proposed a facile method to synthesize NCQDs from chitosan
with high yield and demonstrated that carbon quantum dots derived
from chitosan were promising for ion detection.

1 Introduction
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs)
have received much attention due to
their extraordinary properties, including excellent biocompatibility,
low cytotoxicity, good cell permeability, and simple synthetic routes.1,2 As a new class of fluorescent carbon nanomaterials, CQDs have potential
applications in multiple scientific fields, such as bioimaging, drug
delivery, catalysts, energy conversion devices, optoelectronics, detection
of metal ions, and so forth.3−6 Generally, synthetic routes of the CQDs could be
classified into top-down and bottom-up approaches.7 The top-down methods refer to processes involving cutting
larger carbon structures into smaller pieces, including chemical oxidation,
electrochemical synthesis, arc-discharge and laser-ablation, and so
on.2 In these processes, the CQDs are formed
from macroscopic carbon materials such as graphite, active carbon,
graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, coal, carbonized waste carbon paper,
and biomass.7−9 By contrast, the bottom-up approaches refer to synthesize
CQDs from organic molecular precursors using specific synthetic means
such as microwave irradiation, hydrothermal treatments, ultra-sonication,
and thermal combustion.7 To get high quality
CQDs, usually, expensive starting materials, or high reaction temperature,
or further complex surface-passivation is needed, hindering its large-scale
commercialization. Therefore, exploring simple, cheap and environmentally
friendly way to synthesize CQDs is of great importance.

It is
widely accepted that hydrothermal carbonization is a green,
sustainable and facile method for synthesizing CQDs.2,7 Great efforts have been made to synthesize CQDs by hydrothermal
method using biomass.10−14 These biomass-derived precursors are considered to be the most promising
staring materials for CQDs because of its low cost, environmental
friendliness, abundance and varieties of heteroatom doping.15−19 Chitosan is the second most abundant natural polymer that exists
extensively in the shell of crustaceans. This kind of special macromolecule
has significant applications in the biomaterial fields owing to its
nontoxicity and biocompatibility.20,21 Previously,
chitosan had been used to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCQDs)
using the hydrothermal method under a mild reaction condition of 180
°C.11,22 Zhang et al. reported an approach to synthesize
NCQDs from chitosan by carbonization at 300 °C, and quantum efficiency
of the NCQDs was up to 4.34%.13 Nessim
et al. proposed a method to synthesize NCQDs from chitosan using chemical
vapor deposition, in which the obtained NCQDs exhibited a graphenelike
structure.12 As is known to all, post-treatments
such as high-speed centrifugation, dialysis, and freeze drying are
often adopted in the purification process. These operations are usually
time-consuming and complicated.23 To synthesize
biomass-derived CQDs efficiently, it is important to simplify the
purification process.

In this work, NCQDs were synthesized from
chitosan by hydrothermal
carbonization and purified via a simple ethanol precipitation process.
The product yield of the NCQDs was as high as 85.3%, which was better
than the previously reported scientific data on the yield of biomass-derived
CQDs (Figure 1). Studies
have shown that the NCQDs had a strong blue fluorescence emission
with a high quantum yield (QY) of 6.6%, and the NCQDs exhibited excellent
metal ion detection ability. This work might benefit for the applications
of NCQDs on a large scale.

biomass-derived CQDs from the science database.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology and Chemical Composition
The morphology of the NCQDs is shown in Figure 2a. Clearly, the synthesized NCQDs were uniform
in size and had a nearly spherical shape. The NCQDs had a narrow size
distribution, and its diameters were in the range of 2–10 nm.
The gaussian fitting curve (based on more than 100 particles) showed
that the average size of the NCQDs was 6 nm, as shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) HRTEM image of the
NCQDs. (b) Statistical diameter distribution
of the NCQDs from HRTEM images.

XRD patterns of the chitosan and
the NCQDs are presented in Figure 3a. The chitosan sample
showed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 20° and 11°, which
were deemed as the characteristic crystallization peak and the amorphous
peak, respectively.13 After hydrothermal
carbonization, the crystalline peak of chitosan had diminished and
a new peak at 2θ = 25° with a large full width at half
maximum (FWHM) was observed. Disappearance of the characteristic crystalline
peaks and appearance of a broad new diffraction peak revealed that
chitosan had been completely carbonized and an amorphous carbon phase
was formed.17

NCQDs and chitosan. (b) Fourier transform
infrared spectra (FTIR) spectra of chitosan and NCQDs. (c) Raman spectra
of the NCQDs.

FTIR spectra of the chitosan and the NCQDs are
shown in Figure 3b.
For the NCQDs,
absorptions at 3500–3200, 1695–1570, and 1400 cm–1 were strengthened, indicating the existence of O–H/N–H,
C=O, and N–H bands (attributed to amide groups) and
COOH bands, respectively. Incidentally, these polar units were responsible
for the good dispersity of the NCQDs in water. For the chitosan, the
C–H stretching bands obviously disappeared or weakened at 2880
and 1130–1064 cm–1, illustrating the depolymerization
of the chitosan chains and the decomposition of the pyranose rings
during carbonization. The presence of C=O bands demonstrated
that carboxyl or carbonyl moieties existed in the NCQDs, which was
consistent with the XPS results.11,17

The
Raman spectrum of the NCQDs showed a disordered (D) band at
1350 cm–1 and a crystalline (G) band at 1585 cm–1 (Figure 3c). The D band is generally due to amorphous sp3 carbon, and the G band belongs to the crystalline sp2 carbon of graphitic domains and the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon-bonded atoms.24,25 The intensity ratio
of D to G bands (ID/IG ratio) was 0.87, which indicated partially the existence
of disorientation and stacking of graphene sheets in NCQDs.24

Further information on the composition
of the NCQDs was obtained
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Figure 4a. The survey scan performed
in the 0–1350 eV binding energy range showed characteristic
peaks of elements C, O, and N. The integral area ratio of C/O/N was
about 9:4:1. By careful analysis of the C 1s peaks between 281 and
291 eV (Figure 4b),
four peaks at 284.60, 285.40, 286.10, and 288.37 eV were found, which
should be attributed to the C–C/C=C, C–N, C–O,
and C=O bonds, respectively.26 It
should be noted that the characteristic peak at around 284.60 eV was
an indication of sp2 aromatic or graphitic structures.17 The appearance of C–O and C=O
signals could confirm the existence of carbonyl and carboxyl groups
in NCQDs.17 Moreover, the N 1s spectrum
of the NCQDs (Figure 4c) showed predominant peaks at 399.80 and 400.60 eV,
which were caused by the N–H and C=N interactions.13,27 The O 1s spectrum (Figure 4d) presented two peaks at 532.01 and 533.17 eV, which were
attributed to C=O and C–O bonds, respectively.13 The XPS results suggested that there existed
hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of the NCQDs. The hydrophilic
property of the NCQDs could be further confirmed by the surface potential
measurement, as shown in Figure S1.

Figure 4 (a) Full scan
of the XPS spectra, (b) C 1s XPS spectra, (c) N 1s
XPS spectra, and (d) O 1s XPS spectra of as-prepared NCQDs.

According to the discussions above, the possible
reaction route
for the synthesis of the NCQDs was as follows: the interactions between
the positive charges in the protonated amino groups of chitosan and
the negative charges in the carboxylate groups of citric acid lead
to the formation of a chitosan–citrate complex.28 Such a complex first forms a polymerlike structure
and then is further carbonized to form NCQDs with carboxyl, hydroxyl,
and amino groups on its surface. This synthetic mechanism (Figure 5) was similar to
that in a previous report.29 It should
be emphasized that the NCQD powder could be well dispersed in aqueous
solutions (>40 mg/mL). When ethanol was added to the NCQD solution,
the intermolecular hydrogen bond between NCQDs and water was destroyed,
and the −COOH and −NH2 groups on its surface
formed a strong hydrogen bond. These features were beneficial for
the precipitation and purification of the NCQDs, leading to the final
high product yield of 85.3%. It should be noted that such a productivity
was much higher than those CQDs obtained from the traditional hydrothermal
method (see Figure 1).

Figure 5 Possible reaction route for the synthesis of the NCQDs.

2.2 Optical Properties of CQDs
UV–vis
absorption of the NCQDs (Figure 6a) showed an absorption peak at 330 nm with a shoulder
at around 240 nm, which were aroused from π–π*
transition of the C=C bonds and n−π* transition
of the C=O bonds.30 As shown in Figure 6b, the NCQDs displayed
a maximum emission at 418 nm when excited with a 310 nm light. The
FWHM was 108 nm, indicating a complex fluorescence emission from the
NCQDs.29 The aqueous solution of the NCQDs
showed strong blue light emission under UV irradiation. When exposed
to the daylight, the solution changed back to translucent yellow (right
inset, Figure 6b).
As shown in Figure 6c, the NCQDs exhibited typical excitation-dependent photoluminescent
behavior, which was similar to previous reports.31,32 Upon increasing the excitation wavelength from 270 to 490 nm, the
emission peak red-shifted from 418 to 530 nm. Such behavior could
be explained by the broad distribution of different emissive sites
in the NCQDs.31

spectra. (b) fluorescence excitation

and UV radiation). (c) Fluorescence emission spectra of the NCQDs
obtained at different excitation wavelengths with a 20 nm increment
from 270 to 490 nm. (d) Time-resolved PL decay and fitting curves
for the as-prepared NCQDs.

In consideration of its strong luminous property,
the NCQD aqueous
solution (20 mg/mL) was utilized as ink for writing. The Chinese characters
“”
written from the ink emitted a strong fluorescence when excited with
UV lamps, as shown in Figure S2. When mixed
with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solution, the NCQDs/PVA composite film
precursor was obtained. Figure S3 shows
the fluorescence microscopy images of the PVA/NCQD film with daylight,
UV, blue, and green light excitation. The multicolor emission effect
of the composite film suggested that the NCQDs were promising for
electronic labels and biological imaging.

The maximum photoluminescence
(PL) quantum yield was measured to
be 6.6% when at 418 nm blue fluorescence was emitted. The average
lifetime of the NCQDs was fitted to be 10.45 ns, as shown in Figure 6d. The lifetime of
the NCQDs was longer than the previously reported values, suggesting
that the NCQDs in this work were suitable for optoelectronic and biological
applications.33

2.3 Detection of Metal Ions
Metal ions
are widely distributed in the environmental and biological systems.34 Accurate detection of the metal ion content
is of significant importance for the ecosystems and life systems.33,35 Different from other methods, the fluorescence detection method
has unique advantages such as high sensitivity, simple operation,
convenient monitoring, and fast reaction.33 To evaluate the selectivity of the NCQDs for metal ion detection,
different metal ions, including Mg2+, Mn2+,
Fe2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Pb2+, were used
as target ions. Detection results are shown in Figure 7a. Through analysis of the fluorescence intensity
ratio I/I0 (where I and I0 are the fluorescence
intensities at 418 nm after and before the addition of target ions),
it was found that the NCQDs had a universal detecting ability for
many ions. Specifically, the fluorescence intensity ratio for Fe3+ detection was the lowest with a value of 0.1, demonstrating
the high detectivity of the NCQDs for Fe3+.

Figure 7 Fluorescence response

quenching induced by different metal ions at a concentration of 1
mM (I0 and I are the
fluorescence intensities of the NCQD aqueous dispersion without and
with metal ions, respectively). (b) Fluorescence spectra of NCQDs
at various concentrations of Fe3+ ranging from 0 to 1 mM.
The excitation wavelength is fixed at 310 nm. (c) Linear relationship
between fluorescence and Fe3+ concentration at 0–0.18
mM.

To further study the Fe3+ sensitivity
of the NCQDs,
Fe3+ ions with different concentrations were added into
the NCQDs aqueous solution and the fluorescence intensities were measured.
As shown in Figure 7b, the PL intensities decreased with the increase of Fe3+ concentration. This was easy to understand since the chelation between
Fe3+ ions and phenolic hydroxy groups could reduce fluorescence
emission from the NCQDs.8Figure 7c depicts the relationship
of the fluorescence quenching value ΔI/I0 with the concentration of Fe3+,
where ΔI = I0 – I. Obviously, the fluorescence quenching values presented
an almost linear relationship in the range of 0–0.18 mM. The
theoretical lower detection limit was calculated to be 1.57 μM
(= 3σ/m, where σ is the standard deviation
and m is the slope of the linear response region),
which was much lower than most of the previously reported values as
shown in Table 1. The
results clearly suggested that the NCQDs in this contribution had
high sensitivity in metal ion detection.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully synthetized
NCQDs from chitosan. A simple
ethanol precipitation procedure was adopted for purification. The
product yield of the NCQDs was as high as 85.3%. The synthesized NCQDs
possessed excellent water dispersity (>40 mg/mL) due to the hydrophilic
functional groups on the surface. Spectral studies had shown that
the NCQDs could reach a high quantum yield of 6.6%. The metal ion
detection experiment illustrated that the NCQDs have universal ion
detection capability and is especially suitable for Fe3+ monitoring. This contribution may be beneficial for the large-scale
production and application of NCQDs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Chitosan powder (DD ≥
95%, 100–200 mPa s) and lead(II) acetate trihydrate (A.R.)
were purchased from Macklin Reagent Biochemical Co. Ltd. The other
reagents were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Reagent Co. All reagents
were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis of CQDs
Chitosan powder
was dissolved in 0.5 M citric acid (CA) solution to obtain 1 wt %
chitosan aqueous solution. The chitosan aqueous solution and urea
were added to a 25 mL Teflon container that was packed into a stainless
steel autoclave. Then, the experimental installation was heated to
180 °C and kept for 10 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled
to room temperature in the air. The obtained aqueous solution was
first mixed with CH2Cl2, and then, the underlying
aqueous solution was removed. Afterward, the aqueous solution was
filtered with a 0.22 μm filter membrane and ethanol was employed
for precipitation. The precipitate was centrifuged (3600 rpm), and
the final product was dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The obtained solid
powder was denoted CQDs. The details of the synthesis of NCQDs is
illustrated in Scheme 1.

Aqueous
Solution
4.3 Characterization
The morphology of
the NCQDs was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM;
HT7700 EXALENS, operated at 200 kV). The size distribution of the
NCQDs was calculated based on their TEM images. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were carried on an XRD diffractometer (D8 Advance,
Bruker, PANalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406
nm). Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, 532 nm laser) was employed to characterize
the structure of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI X-ray spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic A1 Kα (1486.7 eV). The
samples were recorded on a TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany)
with KBr powder as the background, ranging from 4000 to 500 cm–1. The ζ-potential was measured on a Malvern
Nano ZS instrument (Malvern). Optical absorption was measured on a
UV-2550 (Shimadzu, Japan) spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were
recorded on an LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer (PE) with a slit width
of 5 nm for excitation and emission. The excitation was increased
by a 20 nm increment starting from 270 to 490 nm. All of the optical
spectra were recorded with a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. Fluorescence
decay curves and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of the
as-prepared NCQDs were measured at room temperature using an Edinburgh
FLSP 920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with an integrating
sphere under 310 nm excitation.

4.4 Detection of Metal Ions
Different
concentrations of Fe3+ aqueous solutions (0–0.20
mM, interval of 0.02 mM; 0.20–1.0 mM, interval of 0.2 mM) and
other metal ion solutions (1.0 mM) were freshly prepared. To evaluate
the sensitivity of the NCQDs to Fe3+, the Fe3+ solutions of different concentrations were mixed with 0.01 mg/mL
NCQD aqueous dispersion at 1:1 volume ratio. After 5 min of equilibration,
fluorescence from the mixed solutions was detected by a fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Other metal ionic solutions were mixed and detected
with the NCQDs in the same way. All of the experiments were performed
at room temperature.
