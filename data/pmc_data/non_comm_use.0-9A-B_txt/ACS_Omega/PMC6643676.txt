Transition-metal-based
layered double hydroxides (TM LDHs) have emerged as highly efficient
water oxidation catalysts. They are promising and have the potential
to replace the rare and expensive precious metal-based ones such as
RuO2 and IrO2, which have been well established.
In this perspective, we will summarize the current development of
TM LDHs as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts toward electrochemical
water splitting. Particular emphasis will be placed on the roles of
the transition-metal cations and the effects of their combination
on their catalytic performance for the OER. It is hoped that this
perspective will provide fundamental guidelines for future researches
in this booming area.

1 Introduction
The hydrogen and oxygen generation from water splitting is of great
importance since it can simultaneously tackle the issues of energy
crisis and environmental pollution problems. Indeed, it has aroused
extensive research interest ever since the concept of water splitting
was demonstrated, which has intensified in the recent few decades.1 Electrochemical (EC) water splitting separates
the whole process into two half-reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions
(HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). As is well known, compared
to HER, OER is much more kinetically sluggish and requires a very
high overpotential, thus limiting the water splitting efficiency and
hindering the development of the hydrogen production industry based
on water splitting.

The state-of-the-art catalysts of RuO2 and IrO2 show effective water oxidation activity.2 However, the high cost of Ir ($16 181
kg–1) and Ru ($2000 kg–1) significantly
limits their
large-scale utilization.3 Fortunately,
the first-row transition-metal-based compounds with controlled chemical
composition and microstructures have been found to have comparable
water splitting performance, with much more bountiful resources and
lower prices. Among these materials, transition-metal-based layered
double hydroxides (TM LDHs) with the general formula of [M1–x2+M3+x(OH)2]x+(An–)x/n·mH2O, consisting of edge-sharing hydroxyl coordinated
octahedrons and intercalated anions between hydroxyl layers,4 have been extensively studied, which surprisingly
have exhibited even higher OER activities with overpotentials as low
as ∼200 mV, which are smaller than that of RuO2 and
IrO2 (∼250 mV). In spite of the tremendous research
progress that has been made in developing TM LDH as efficient OER
catalysts, the understanding of the underlying reasons for the high
water oxidation performance of TM LDH is still limited. For instance,
the synergistic effect between the divalent and trivalent cations
and their effects on OER remain elusive. We notice that some excellent
reviews have summarized the recent developments of TM LDH catalysts,
but dedicated discussions on the effects of metal combinations in
TM LDH on their catalytic performance are still missing despite the
significance of such combinations.2,5

In this
perspective, we survey the recent developments of TM LDHs
with unary, binary, and ternary transition-metal ions and their OER
catalytic performances, focusing on the effects of metal combinations
that have strong influences on the OER activity. First, the basic
criteria for evaluation of water oxidation catalysts including overpotential
(η), Tafel slope (b), exchanged current density
(i0), geometric current density (jg), and specific current density (js) will be introduced, followed by the
discussion of the OER mechanism with which the TM LDH catalysts operate.
Then, the specific TM LDHs with unary, binary, and ternary transition
metals will be presented and the relationship between their chemical
compositions and OER performance discussed. Explanations will be given
on the active sites of NiFe LDH and the reactivity difference between
different binary metal LDHs with binary transition metals. Finally,
a summary and prospect will be provided encompassing the challenges
and opportunities in this exciting research area.

2 Basic Criteria for OER Catalysts and Mechanisms
of OER
The basic criteria to evaluate OER catalysis will
be introduced
in this section. Overpotential (η), calculated by the difference
between the applied potential (E) to reach a certain
current density and the equilibrium potential (Eeq) (as shown in eq 1), is the critical and most frequently used descriptor to
evaluate the performance of an OER catalyst. Eeq is the half reaction’s thermodynamically determined
reduction potential, and E is the potential at which
the redox event is experimentally observed. Generally, η is
usually given at the onset of OER and at the current density of 10
mA cm–2, which corresponds to a 10% solar to hydrogen
efficiency under 1 sun illumination. The existence of overpotential
implies that the cell requires more energy than thermodynamically
expected to drive a reaction. Therefore, a lower overpotential suggested
a better OER activity.2 1  Tafel slope (b), which describes
the influence of potential/overpotential on steady-state current density,
is another key descriptor to evaluate OER kinetics. The value of b could be calculated by eq 2, where R, T, and F are ideal gas constant, temperature, and Faradaic constant,
respectively. α is the transfer coefficient that is highly related
to Tafel slope. It has been reported that if b =
120 mV dec–1, the rate-determining step is dominated
by the single-electron transfer step. If b = 60 mV
dec–1, it hints that the chemical reaction after
one-electron transfer reactions is the rate-determining step. If b = 30 mV dec–1, the rate-determining
step is the third electron transfer step. Therefore, from the value
of Tafel slope, we can roughly determine the rate-determining step
of OER. Generally, small Tafel slope indicates fast reaction kinetics,
and the rate-determining step is supposed to be at the ending part
of the reaction.2 Therefore, catalysts
with small Tafel slopes often show good catalytic activity for OER.
However, it should be noted that the Tafel slope is often overestimated
if geometric current density is used because of the fact that the
geometric current density is usually smaller than the specific current
density. Moreover, Tafel slope is not accurate to describe the performance
of OER catalysts because of its oversimplified assumptions.6 2  Turnover
frequencies (TOFs) refer to the turnover
per unit time, representing the total number of moles transformed
into the desired product by one mole of active site per time. Therefore,
the number of TOFs determines the level of activity of the catalysts,
which is given by eq 3, where j is the current density at a specified
overpotential, A is the area of the electrode, and m is the number of moles of active materials deposited onto
the electrodes.7 Moreover, it has been
suggested that TOFs at different overpotentials could be different;
therefore, the applied overpotential should be provided when presenting
TOF.8 3  Exchange current density
(i0) is defined as the current density
at η = 0 (j0) divides surface area
(A);
the magnitude of i0 reflects the intrinsic
charge transfer between reactant and catalyst (eq 4). A higher i0 hints at better catalytic performance. i0 can be described by eq 5, in which k° is the rate constant, and ρ
and ω are the reaction orders of Red and Ox, respectively.9 4   5  Different from exchange
current density, geometric
current density (jg) is given by the current
density normalized by geometric surface area at a certain overpotential. jg has practical meaning in developing water
splitting devices; however, it usually overestimates the electrochemical
performance of a catalyst due to the larger actual surface area than
the geometric surface area. Figure 1 shows the Tafel slopes of Co3O4 and IrO2 by using the current density calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), electrochemical (EC), and disk surface area, respectively.
From Figure 1, we can
also see that the Tafel slope of Co3O4 is smaller
than that of IrO2 with respect to the geometric surface
area. One may rush to conclude that the OER performance of Co3O4 is better than IrO2. However, if
the BET or EC surface area is used, the performance of Co3O4 is poorer than that of IrO2,10 suggesting that the applied active surface area
is quite important to determine the performance of a catalyst.10 Generally, the more accurate the surface area
used, the more accurate the current density that is obtained, leading
to a more precise evaluation of the catalyst.

area on evaluation of a catalyst. Tafel plots

surface area, separately. Reproduced with permission from ref (10). Copyright 2018 Elsevier

Understanding the mechanism of
OER has a fundamental importance
in designing new OER catalysts; therefore, let us first discuss the
general mechanisms of OERs before presenting the detailed reactivity
about LDH. The catalytic cycle is shown in Figure 2; association mechanism and oxy–oxy
coupling mechanism are generally proposed. There are four elementary
steps for the association mechanism (eqs 6–9): association of hydroxide
anions to form absorbed OH* accompanied by losing one electron, generation
of reactive oxy intermediate O* from OH* with loss of one electron
and generation one molecule of water, nucleophilic attack of absorbed
oxy O* by the hydroxide anion with release of one electron to form
O–O bond giving OOH*, and formation of one molecule of oxygen
with release of an electron and one molecule of water to regenerate
the catalyst and complete the catalytic cycle. For the oxy–oxy
coupling mechanism (eqs 6, 7, and 10), one molecule
of oxygen will be generated accompanied by the regeneration of catalyst
after generating the oxy intermediate O*. For the association mechanism,
the formation of OOH* is generally regarded as the rate-determining
step due to the large energy barrier according to density functional
theory (DFT) calculations.12 For the oxy–oxy
coupling mechanism (given by eqs 6, 7, and 10),
the coupling between two oxy is supposed to withstand a very high
kinetic barrier and thus is the rate-determining step.13

Figure 2 Catalytic cycle for the OER on transition-metal-based
catalysts
in alkaline conditions.

In the above-mentioned processes, formation of OOH* involves
oxidation
of oxygen from O* to OOH*, which is usually regarded as the rate-determining
step. Therefore, LDH with high oxidation ability would facilitate
the formation of OOH*. In addition, OER involves formation and cleavage
of metal–oxygen bonds; in principle, catalysts with superior
OER activity should possess a suitable oxygen bonding strength, neither
too strong nor too weak. As oxidation ability and oxygen binding energy of LDH vary with the change of transition metals,
they have a critical influence on the OER activity of LDH. Therefore,
in this perspective, we will focus on the effects of chemical composition
on the oxygen binding energy and oxidation ability of LDH. Unary,
binary, and ternary transition-metal-based LDHs toward OER will be discussed. 6   7   8   9   10  

3 Unary Metal-Based LDH
Unary metal-based LDHs exhibited limited
OER activity, but they
provide an ideal platform for us to understand the intrinsic OER activity
of LDHs due to their structural simplicity. In this part, we will
first introduce Ni-based LDH, followed by Fe-based LDH, Co-based LDH,
and the recently reported V-based LDH. As transition-metal hydroxide
and transition-metal-oxy/hydroxide can interconvert via Bode’s
Diagram,14 we also treated transition-metal
oxyhydroxide as LDH for simplicity. The performance evaluation factors
such as overpotential at 10 mA cm–2, Tafel slope,
and TOF of unary metal LDHs are given in Table 1.

3.1 VIII Group Single Transition-Metal
Hydroxides/Oxyhydroxides
Ni-based compounds are the most
widely used OER catalysts; actually,
NiOx was employed for OER early in the
1980s.15 However, it did not arouse research
interests until 2012 when Boettcher in situ generated nickel layered
hydroxide/oxyhydroxide from NiOx through
an electrochemical conditioning process (Figure 3).16 The as-in
situ-generated Ni hydroxide/oxyhydroxide exhibited an outstanding
OER performance, with a low overpotential of 297 mV at 1 mA cm–2, an extremely small Tafel slope of 29 mv dec–1, and a considerably large TOF of 0.17 s–1 at η = 300 mV in 1 mol L–1 (M) KOH, better
than that of the state-of-the-art catalyst of IrOx catalysts (η = 378 mV at 1 mA cm–2, b = 49 mv dec–1, TOF = 0.0089
s–1 at η = 300 mV in 1 M KOH).

NiFe LDH is the most
effective for OER (will be discussed in Section 4.1), but NiOOH
and Ni(OH)2 are not so effective toward OER. Therefore,
studying the OER activity of Fe-based LDH is important to understand
the superior activity of NiFe LDH and has aroused much attention.
Friebel and Bell studied the intrinsic OER activity of γ-FeOOH
and found that the overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 of
γ-FeOOH is 550 mV in 0.1 M KOH, which is smaller than that of
Fe-free γ-NiOOH (η = 660 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 0.1 M KOH). However, it is much higher than that of (Ni,Fe)OOH
(η = 360 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 0.1 M KOH).17 Moreover, the calculations also indicated that
the overpotential of γ-FeOOH is 520 mV, in good agreement with
experiments.17 Boettcher also studied the
OER activity of FeOOH and suggested that FeOOH had high OER activity,
but was limited by its poor conductivity, which has a measurable conductivity
of 2.2 × 10–2 mS cm–1 only
when the overpotential is larger than 400 mV.18

Similar to Ni and Fe, the remaining first-row group
VIII transition metal, cobalt, can also form a layered double hydroxide
structure and, of course, has received much interest. Wang compared
the OER activities of α-Co(OH)2, β-Co(OH)2, and β-CoOOH19 and found
that α-Co(OH)2 will transform to γ-CoOOH before
the OER, and the resulting γ-CoOOH inherits a large basal distance
of α-Co(OH)2. It has an overpotential of 400 mV at
10 mA cm–2 in 0.1 M KOH, interestingly, a Tafel
slope of 44 mV dec–1 when η is smaller than
350 mV, and 130 mV dec–1 when η is larger
than 350 mV. Moreover, α-Co(OH)2 is more active than
β-Co(OH)2, which might be due to the large interlayer
space in the α-Co(OH)2.

Materials with ultrathin
structures usually have high specific
and exposed surface area and are abundant in vacancies, leading to
a higher number of active sites and thus higher activities. Pan and
Wei synthesized an atomically thin γ-CoOOH, with a thickness
of only 1.4 nm. Expectedly, the as-prepared γ-CoOOH has very
high mass activities and abundant-active sites, thus leading to a
sharp increase of OER activity with η = 300 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH. Interestingly, the as-prepared γ-CoOOH is half-metallic
in contrast to its bulk, which was proposed to be related to the presence
of dangling bonds in the CoO6–x octahedron as supported by DFT calculations.20 Kang and Yao also prepared Co-based LDH with atomic thickness
for OER. Owing to its ultrathin structure, the OER activity of the
Co-based LDH can have an overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm–2, a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec–1, and a TOF of 0.801
s–1 at η = 350 mV in 1 M KOH.21 Besides ultrathin structures, a larger interlayer spacing
of LDH can also lead to a higher number of active sites. Sun and Chen
reported benzoate anion interacted with CoOOH with
an interlayer spacing as large as 14.72 Å, which allows the easy
permeation of water and hydroxide, resulting in a higher number of
active sites.22 And the overpotential at
50 mA cm–2 is only 291 mV in 1 M KOH.

3.2 V-Hydroxides/Oxyhydroxides
In addition
to the intensively studied VIII transition-metal-based LDH, V and
Mn compounds have also been investigated. In 2012, Markovic studied
the trends for OER on 3d transition-metal hydr(oxy)oxide catalysts
(M2+δOδ(OH)2−δ/Pt(111)) and discovered that the reactivity toward OER is in the
order Mn < Fe < Co < Ni, which is governed by the OH–M2+δ bond strength (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn).23 According to the Sabatier principle, too weak
or too strong M–OH bonds would retard the OER reactivity. Copper
and zinc have too many d electrons in the d orbitals, which cause
strong repulsions between the d electrons and 2p electrons of oxygen.
Expectedly, Cu(OH)2 and Zn(OH)2 exhibited poor
OER activities. Early transition metals, such as titanium, have few
d electrons in the d orbitals, which lead to very strong OH–M
bonds, and are supposed to be ineffective toward OER.23

Despite that the early transition-metal hydroxide
has a strong M–OH bond, which is proposed to be unfavorable
for OER, VOOH hollow nanospheres, structurally resembling lepidocrocite
γ-FeOOH as evidenced by their similar X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern (Figure 4a),
have been employed as an efficient OER catalyst by Liang and Wang,24 exhibiting an overpotential of 270 mV for OER
at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH. It has been well established that V is
an early transition metal, favoring its high oxidation states, +5
and +4, whereas V has an oxidation state of +3 in VOOH. It may be
of concern that VOOH is unstable during OER;
however, the stability test given in Figure 4b shows that VOOH is quite stable during
OER. And the reactivity of VOOH does not decrease even after 5000
cycles, as shown in the inset of Figure 4b. Moreover, the prepared VOOH can be used
as HER catalyst, with an overpotential of 164 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 104 mV dec–1. The advanced
water splitting performance of VOOH in this work was contributed to the large surface area from the hollow sphere morphology.

4 Binary Metal-Based LDH
Unary-transition-metal-based LDHs are limited by their low intrinsic
OER activity or conductivity. Fortunately, by doping the second metal
ions into the unary-TM LDH, the as-formed binary LDHs such as NiFe
LDH, NiCo LDH, and CoFe LDH showed a much higher OER performance,
which will be summarized and discussed in this section. The performance
evaluation factors such as overpotential at 10 mA cm–2, Tafel slope, and TOF of binary metal LDHs are given in Table 2.

4.1 NiFe LDH
LDH suffers
from low conductivity,
which is one of the major challenges needed to be overcome for an
advanced OER performance. Therefore, various methods have been applied
to tackle this problem.7,12b,16,17,26 In 2013, Dai
deposited NiFe LDH on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to obtain NiFe-CNT LDH
based on the fact that the end tips of carbon nanotube (CNT) have
many carboxylic groups that can coordinate to metal centers (Figure 5a).26a The as-prepared NiFe-CNT LDH exhibited a Tafel slope of
31 mV dec–1 at 1 M KOH and has an overpotential
of 290 mV at 5 mA cm–2. The TOF is 0.56 s–1 at an η = 300 mV in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the NiFe-CNT LDH exhibited
a better stability than Ir/C at a constant current density of 5 mA
cm–2. In 2014, Yang reported the graphene oxide
(GO) intercalated NiFe LDH by substitution of anions (CO32− or Cl−) with GO (Figure 5b).7 The as-prepared
NiFe-GO LDH has an overpotential as low as 210 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of only 40 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the TOF can reach 0.38 s–1 at η = 300 mV. Since the conductivity of GO can be enhanced
by reduction, we further reduce NiFe-GO LDH by hydrazine to obtain
reduced GO intercalated NiFe-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) LDH; the
overpotential and Tafel slope can be further lowered to 195 mV at
10 mA cm–2 and 39 mV dec–1, respectively.
Moreover, the TOF can reach 0.98 s–1 at η
= 300 mV. The higher conductivity of FeNi-rGO LDH is evidenced by
alternating current impedance spectra. It should be noted that the
basal spacing of FeNi-GO LDH is 1.1 nm, which is much larger than
the basal spacing of FeNi-CO3 LDH (0.75 nm), suggesting
that GO has successfully intercalated into the NiFe LDH. And the enlarged
basal distance of NiFe LDH allows efficient association of reactants
and dissociation of products, and that is why a sharp increase of
TOF is observed. Later, NiFe LDH-GO and NiFe LDH-rGO have also been
reported through solvothermal and chemical reduction methods by Zhan
and Hou.26j

Besides combination with conductive
carbon materials, other conducting
materials were also applied to reduce the charge transfer resistance
of the LDHs. Wang and Qiu prepared hierarchical NiFe LDH/Ti3C2-MXene for OER.28 Owing to
the stabilization by Ti3C2-MXene, better conductivity,
and electronic interaction between Ti3C2-MXene
and NiFe LDH, the as-prepared hierarchical NiFe LDH/Ti3C2-MXene exhibited a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec–1 and overpotential of ∼300 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH. The TOF at η = 300 mV is 0.26 s–1. Zhang and Huang grew NiFe LDH on conducting Ni3S2 nanorods, as shown in Figure 5c.27 As Ni3S2 nanorods are much more electron rich than NiFe LDH, electrons
will flow to NiFe LDH, leading to the partial reduction of NiFe LDH.
To maintain the charge neutrality, oxygen vacancies are generated
in NiFe LDH as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
As a result, the intrinsic activity of NiFe LDH was enhanced. Moreover,
the number of active sites also increased after being loaded on the
Ni3S2 nanorods. The overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 is as low as 190 mV, and the Tafel slope is also
only 38 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH. Wang reported NiFe
LDH@Au hybridized nanoarrays on nickel foam. The as-prepared NiFe
LDH@Au/Ni foams exhibited overpotentials of
only 221, 235, and 270 mV at 50, 100, and 500 mA cm2–, respectively, in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the Tafel slope decreased to
48.4 mV dec–1, in comparison to NiFe LHD/Ni foam
with a Tafel slope of 71.1 mV dec–1.29 Huang reported single-crystalline NiFe LDH array
on a Ni foam, and the as-prepared NiFe LDH array showed an excellent
OER activity.30 The overpotentials at 10,
50, and 100 mA cm–2 are only 210, 240, and 260 mV
in 1 M KOH, which is smaller than the coated NiFe LDH film. Moreover,
the Tafel slope is 31 mV dec–1 in the overpotential
region of 240–260 mV, suggesting a faster OER kinetics and
large current density. Xie, Zheng, and Sun grew an amorphous NiFe-borate
layer on a NiFe LDH surface and found that the OER performance was
greatly boosted owing to the higher surface roughness and increased
number of active sites.31 NiFe LDH is effective
toward OER but suffers from lower conductivity.
It has been reported that substitution of the very electronegative
oxygen to other less electronegative elements, such as sulfur,32 selenium,33 phosphorus,34 and nitrogen,35 can
push up the valence bond of NiFe LDH, thus leading to a higher conductivity
and a better OER activity.

4.2 Other Ni-Based Binary Metal
LDHs
Besides NiFe LDHs, other Ni-based bimetal LDHs, including
NiCo, NiMn,
NiCr, NiTi, NiV, NiGa, and NiAl LDHs, also have been well studied,
which will be discussed in this section.

Qian and Li reported
NiCo LDH nanosheet arrays on Ni foam for overall water splitting.36 The as-prepared NiCo LDH has an overpotential
of 271 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 72
mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH. And it should be noted that
it was used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting
for the first time, which showed an overpotential of 162 mV for HER
at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. Similarly, Jiang
and Ai reported NiCo LDH nanosheets for OER that has an overpotential
of 290 mV at 10 mA cm–2, with the Tafel slope being
113 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH.37 And XPS characterizations suggested Co3+ and Co2+ coexist in the prepared NiCo LDH. NiCo LDH nanosheet has also been
reported by Huang, which shows an overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA
cm–2 in 1 M KOH, and the Tafel slope is 42.6 mV
dec–1.38 By postexfoliation
treatment, Hu reported a single layered NiCo LDH, which showed a much
increased OER activity than the bulk counterpart.25 The overpotenial at 10
mA cm–2 and Tafel slope decreased from ∼390
mV and 65 mV dec–1 to ∼334 mV and 41 mV dec–1, respectively, whereas the TOF increased from 0.025
to 0.01 s–1.

The early or middle transition-metal-Ni
LDHs have also been studied,
but admittedly, they are relatively less studied compared with NiFe
LDH and NiCo LDH because the formed M–OH and M–O bonds
are too strong, which is unfavorable for OER. For example, Sun reported
NiMn LDH for OER with an overpotential of 640 mV at 20 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH; however, it was less effective than NiFe LDH (401 mV
at 20 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH).39 NiMn LDH nanosheet has also been synthesized by Huang for overall
water splitting.38 However, in this work,
the NiMn LDH with an overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm–2 is less effective than NiFe LDH with an overpotential of 220 mV
at 10 mA cm–2. NiTi LDH, which acts as a precursor
to prepare NiO-TiO2 ultrafine nanosheet,40 is ineffective for OER. The Tafel slope is as high as 290
mV dec–1, and the TOF at an overpotential of 500
mV is only 0.009 s–1. Surprisingly, monolayer NiV
LDH, which shows a comparable OER activity with NiFe LDH, has been
reported by Sun.41 V exists in V3+, V4+, and V5+, as evidenced by XPS shown in Figure 6a. The presence of
V4+ and V5+ is attributed to the oxidation of
V3+ during the synthesis. And the as-prepared monolayer
NiV LDH (Ni0.75V0.25-LDH) has an overpotential
of 250 mV, a Tafel slope of 50 mv dec–1, and a TOF
of 0.054 ± 0.003 s–1 in 1 M KOH, whereas the
related monolayer NiFe LDH (Ni0.75Fe0.25-LDH)
has a overpotential of 300 mV, Tafel slope of 0.064 mV dec–1, and a TOF of 0.021 ± 0.003 s–1. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopies (EISs) indicated that Ni0.75V0.25-LDH has a lower charge transfer resistance, thus bearing
with a high conductivity. Moreover, the as-prepared NiV LDH exhibited
considerable stability, as shown in Figure 6b. DFT calculations have been performed on
the OER mechanism catalyzed by Ni0.75V0.25-LDH.
Here, V is supposed to be the active site, where H2O*,
OH*, O*, OOH*, and OO* bind on V, and the rate-determining step is
formation of OOH* from O*, which has an overpotential of 620 mV.

In addition, some main-group
element-Ni LDHs are also reported;
as expected, their OER activity is very low. To synthesize porous
β-Ni(OH)2, Wang and Jin first prepared NiGa LDH in
which the Ga3+ will be removed through base etching.42 And it was found that the prepared NiGa LDH
exhibited a little better OER activity than the β-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet, but it was much poorer than the porous β-Ni(OH)2 prepared by etching NiGa LDH. Similarly, the NiAl LDHs are
also prepared as a precursor to synthesize the porous LDH. For example,
Zhang and Xie employed NiAl LDH as a precursor to prepare β-Ni(OH)2 ultrathin nanomesh.43 The prepared
β-Ni(OH)2 ultrathin nanomesh has an excellent OER
activity, whereas the NiAl LDH only shares a similar OER activity
with the β-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet.

4.3 Co-Based
Binary Metal LDH
Cobalt,
with one less d electron than nickel, also received much attention.44 Li and Ge reported CoFe LDH fabricated by coprecipitation,
in which the ratio of Co to Fe can be tuned from 0.5 to 7.4.45 The Co2Fe LDH gave the best OER activity
with an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and
a Tafel slope of 83 mv dec–1 in 1 M KOH. Again,
ultrathin LDHs with abundant defects are supposed to have higher OER
activities. Wang prepared ultrathin CoFe LDHs through Ar plasma etching.46 The Ar plasma etched has a thickness of 0.6
nm, compared to the bulk with a thickness of 20.6 nm. The ultrathin
CoFe LDHs are abundant in Co, Fe, and O vacancies, as evidenced by
the decreased coordination numbers of Co, Fe, and O. The ultrathin
CoFe LDH-Ar has a TOF of 4.78 s–1, whereas the bulk
CoFe LDH has a TOF of 1.12 s–1. And the Tafel slope
and overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 of CoFe LDH-Ar is
37.85 mV dec–1 and 266 mV, respectively, which are
much lower than those in bulk CoFe LDH (57.05 mV dec–1 and 321 mV at 10 mA cm–2). It should be noted
that ultrathin CoFe LDH-Ar has a much smaller charge transfer resistance.
Xiong and Sun reported an ultrathin CoFe-borate-layer-coated CoFe
LDH nanosheet array supported on Ti mesh. The as-prepared catalysts
showed good OER activity at near-neutral condition (0.1 M K2B4O7 solution, pH = 9.2), with an overpotential
of 418 mV at 10 mA cm2–.47

Boettcher studied the roles of Co and Fe in CoFe LDH.18 Compared with CoOOH (rigorously Fe free) films
that exhibited a TOF of 0.007 ± 0.001 s–1 and
FeOOH films that showed a TOF of 0.016 ± 0.003 s–1, CoFeOOH with x between 0.4 and 0.6 has a high
TOF up to 0.61 ± 0.10 s–1. Moreover, the Tafel
slope decreased to 26–39 when x was in the
range from 0.33 to 0.79, from 62 mV dec–1 for CoOOH
to 45 mV dec–1 for FeOOH (Figure 7). Moreover, it has been found that the Co2+/3+ wave shifts anodically with the increase of Fe amount.
Considering the low conductivity and unstable character of FeOOH under
the OER process in alkaline condition, CoFe LDH with the incorporation
of Co had a higher conductivity, hence showing a higher OER activity.

Hu reported ultrathin
CoMn LDH (3.6 nm) for OER; the as-prepared
CoMn LDH has an overpotential of 325 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and Tafel slope of 43 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH, better
than the sum of Co(OH)2 and Mn2O3.48 Interestingly, after anodic conditioning,
the overpotential can be further reduced to 293 mV, which is proposed
to be related to the accumulation of Co(IV) species in the amorphous
layers. Recently, Cheng and Liu reported strongly electrophilic Mn4+-doped CoOOH nanosheet (i.e., CoMn LDH) for OER.49 Theoretical calculations indicated that incorporation
of Mn4+ leads to higher occupancy at the Fermi level (mainly
conduction band), thus facilitating electron transfer in the CoMn
LDH. Moreover, it was found that incorporation of Mn4+ enhanced
the binding of OH– to Co by 0.7 eV. Owing to the
increased conductivity and stronger OH– binding
energy, CoMn LDH exhibited a higher OER activity with η = 255
mV at 10 mA cm–2 and Tafel slope of 38 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH.

Considering that Co2+ is the OER active site and Cr3+-based oxides always exhibit
good conductivity, Huang synthesized
CoCr LDH for OER aiming for a good conductivity and OER activity.50 Indeed, the conductance of CoCr LDH is 4.5 times
and 21.4 times higher than that of CoOOH and Co(OH)2, respectively.
Different atomic ratios of Co and Cr were studied, and it was found
that the Co2Cr LDH gave the best OER activity with an overpotential
of 240 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 81.0
mV dec–1, which are the most active among the best
of Co-based candidates. And the high activity was proposed to be contributed
by the modified electronic structure, improved surface areas, and
better conductivity introduced by Cr3+. Asefa prepared
ZnCo LDH for water and alcohol oxidation in which the ratio of Co3+ to Co2+ was 1 and the ratio of Co to Zn was also
1.51 The overpotential of ZnCo LDH is 0.34
V in 0.1 M KOH solution, which is lower than that of Co3O4 and CoOOH. The TOF at an η of 700 mV can reach
up to 0.88 s–1. It should be noted that ZnCo LDH
has a much smaller Faradaic impedance than Co3O4. Although it was suggested that Zn is inactive for OER and Co is
the active center, the Zn2+ was proposed to facilitate
the formation of highly oxidized Co ions in ZnCo LDH, similar to the
role of Ca2+ in [Mn3CaO4]6+ catalyst. Later on, Xiang and Yan first mixed ZnSO4 and
CoSO4 and then added some H2O2 to
oxidize Co2+ to Co3+, followed by electrodepositing
it to a three-electrode configuration to prepare ZnCo LDH.52 The prepared ZnCo LDH has an overpotential of
427 mV at 2 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH (510 mV at 10 mA
cm–2), and the Tafel slope is 83 mV dec–1. The TOF at η = 700 mV is 3.56 s–1, much
higher than that of ZnCo LDH prepared by the coprecipitation method.51 CoAl LDH has been reported as a precursor to
prepare Al-doped CoP nanoarrays for overall water splitting.53

5 Ternary Metal-Based LDH
Although binary metal-based LDHs exhibited an improved OER activity
than unary metal-based LDH, they often suffer from poor conductivity.
One may think incorporation of a third metal could involve new states
in the forbidden band of binary metal-based LDH, thus leading to a
higher conductivity. Moreover, introduction of another metal might
increase the number of active sites. The overpotential at 10 mA cm–2, Tafel slope, and TOF of ternary metal LDHs are given
in Table 3. By the
way, there are some examples of Ru-55 and
Ir-56doped NiFe LDHs but with the focus
on the HER in alkaline condition, which will not be discussed here.

In 2014, Yang reported ultrathin NiCoFe LDH
for OER.57 The prepared Ni8Co2Fe
LDH has a low overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm–2, a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec–1, and TOF of 0.7
s–1 in 1 M KOH at an overpotenital at 300 mV, outperforming
the Ni10Fe LDH with η = 210 mV at 10 mA cm–2, Tafel slope of 55 mV dec–1, and TOF of 0.53 at
η = 300 mV. The specific surface area of Ni8Co2Fe LDH is 80.44 m2 g–1, much
larger than that of Ni10Fe LDH (46.05 m2 g–1), suggesting that Co incorporation might lead to
more exposed active sites. In addition, charge transfer resistance
also decreased a lot upon incorporation of Co. Inspired by the fact
that Ni2+/Co2+ confinement in the interlayer
space of birnessite enhanced the OER activity,58 Yan and Strongin prepared the cobalt intercalated NiFe
LDH aiming for a better OER activity.59 As the Co–O band length is found to be between CoOOH and
Co(OH)2 based on extended X-ray absorption fine structure
fit results, Co2+ and Co3+ are coexisting. The
performed DFT calculations indicated that substitution of Ni2+ by Co2+ can lower the overpotential of OER (780 mV) by
decreasing the Gibbs free energy differences between O* and OOH*,
whereas substitution of Fe3+ by Co3+ leads to
even lower overpotential (680 mV) of OER. The higher OER activity
is thought to be the modified binding strengths of O* and OOH* due
to the hybridization of 3d orbitals of Co and 2p orbitals of O at
the valence band maximum. NiCoFe LDH has also been reported by Reguera
with an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm–2.60 In this contribution, Co3+ in low-spin
configuration was thought to act as a shield of iron effect over nickel,
which modulates the necessary potential for nickel oxidation.

Further, Sun reported that ternary NiFeMn LDH for OER with an overpotential
of 289 mV at 20 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH is more efficient
than NiMn LDH, which has an overpotential of 640 mV at 20 mA cm–2. Moreover, the ternary NiFeMn LDH is also more effective
than NiFe LDH (401 mV at 20 mA cm–2).39 The higher OER activity of NiFeMn LDH compared
to NiFe LDH was attributed to the fact that Mn4+ modifies
the electronic structures of NiFe LDH, hence leading to a higher conductivity,
as evidenced by DFT calculations and sheet resistance.

Liu and
Sun reported NiFeV LDH with an overpotential of only 195
mV at 20 mA cm–2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH solution,61 much better than NiFe LDH (η = 249 mV at 20 mA cm–2, b = 49 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH)
and NiV LDH (η = 330 mV at 20 mA cm–2, b = 72 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH). The higher
OER activity of NiFeV LDH was ascribed to the increased conductivity
modified by V doping, as evidenced by DFT calculations and EIS. In
addition, the ECSA of NiFeV is also larger than NiFe LDH, suggesting
a higher number of active sites of NiFeV LDH.

To prepare NiFe
LDH with atomic-scale defects, Kuang and Sun first
prepared NiFeZn and NiFeAl LDH precursors; then, the Al and Zn were
partially removed by alkaline etching to obtain defects containing
NiFeZn and NiFeAl LDH, denoted D-NiFeZn LDH and D-NiFeAl LDH, respectively.54 D-NiFeAl LDH has a lower OER activity than NiFe
LDH, but higher activity than NiFeAl LDH. Interestingly, D-NiFeZn
LDH shows a much higher OER activity than NiFe LDH and NiFeAl LDH, with an
overpotential of only 200 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH, and the resulting D-NiFeZn LDHs are abundant
it the Ni–O–Fe unit, which is regarded as the active
site. DFT calculations suggested that formation of O* from OH* is
the rate-determining step, and the D-NiFeZn LDH has a lower overpotential
than D-NiFeAl LDH. Interestingly, Rezvani and Habibi reported that
ternary NiFeZn has a superior OER activity than binary NiFe LDH.62 Moreover, the OER can take place at neutral
condition, and the Tafel slope can be reduced to as low as 16 mV dec–1, whereas the NiFe LDH has a Tafel slope of 29 mV
dec–1. However, the current density is only 5.41
mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 300 mV. The better
OER performance of ternary NiFeZn was attributed to its higher conductivity
modified by Zn2+.

6 Mechanistic Studies
Although transition-metal-based OER catalysts have been studied
experimentally, the theoretical investigation of their structure–composition–performance
relationship is far from satisfactory because of the inaccurate models.
Actually, only the structure of β-Ni(OH)2 has been
accurately determined,63 which belongs
to the P3̅m1 (brucite) space
group, and the lattice parameters are a = b = 3.12 Å and c = 4.66 Å. Carter
performed DFT + U calculations and found that the
pure β-NiOOH has a proton-staggered structure and is antiferromagnetic
(Figure 8).

structure of β-NiOOH. Reproduced with permission from ref (64). Copyright 2015 American

Studying the surfaces
of catalysts has fundamental importance because
most of the OERs take place at the surfaces. Different surfaces of
the catalyst could lead to a different reactivity. As β-NiOOH
shares a similar backbone with LDH and can be modified to be a more
efficient OER catalyst, Carter performed theoretical calculations
on the stability and chemistry of β-NiOOH at the vacuum and
aqueous conditions.65 The calculations
suggested the surface stability in the vacuum follows the order (0001)
> {011̅N} ≫ {012̅N}, N = 0, 1 due to the presence of dangling bonds
at {011̅N} and {012̅N} surfaces. However, the order of stability becomes (0001) > {011̅N} ≈ {012̅N} in aqueous condition,
owing to the water dissociation and adsorption at the {011̅N} and {012̅N} surfaces, which decreased
the numbers of dangling bonds. Here, only low-index surfaces are studied
on the consideration that low-index surfaces are much more stable
than high-index surfaces and that there is no experimental evidence
of generation of high-index surfaces during reactions (Figure 9).

surface of β-NiOOH in aqueous condition.

Owing to its simplicity and great
importance, the OER mechanism
catalyzed by NiOOH has been well studied.14b,66 Considering that the (0001) surface is the most stable, OER takes
place on the (0001) surface most likely. Carter calculated the single-site
association mechanism, binuclear H2O–O mechanism,
binuclear OH–OH mechanism, and binuclear H2O2 mechanism on the (0001) surface of β-NiOOH and found
that the binuclear H2O2 mechanism is energetically
highly unfavorable, whereas the binuclear H2O–O
mechanism and the binuclear OH–OH mechanism have the lowest
overpotentials (∼0.5 V), lower than the single-site association
mechanism (∼0.6 V).66 However, as
mentioned in Section 2, the binuclear mechanism is kinetically unfeasible.13

Nørskov and Bell performed DFT calculations
to study the OER
mechanism catalyzed by β-CoOOH, and it was found that the (101̅4)
surface (η = 480 mV) gives a lower overpotential than the (011̅2)
surface (η = 800 mV). The (101̅4) surface is abundant
in Co3+ ions, whereas the (101̅4) surface has more
Co4+ ions. Association of OH– to generate
OH* would oxidize Co2+ to Co3+ on the (101̅4)
surface, whereas it oxidizes the Co3+ to Co4+ on the (011̅2) surface. Transformation of Co3+ to
Co4+ leads to a too-weak OH* binding, and formation of
OH* becomes the rate-determining step. However, for the (101̅4)
surface, the formation energy of OH* has an optimal value of 1.23
eV.67

There is a debate on whether
Ni or Fe is the active site in NiFe
LDH, and most work supports that Fe is the active site.26m,48 The debate has been well reviewed by Kundu;5d therefore, we will not review the debate on the active sites of
NiFe LDH. However, recently, Goddard performed extensive calculations
using grand canonical quantum mechanics to have a better understanding
of the synergy between Fe and Ni in (Ni,Fe)OOH, which sheds light
on the debate. They suggested that both Fe and Ni are active sites;
high-spin d4 Fe(IV) can stabilize the active O radical
intermediate, whereas the low-spin Ni(IV) catalyzes the subsequent
O–O coupling. Therefore, it is the synergy between Fe and Ni
that leads to the optimal OER activity of (Ni,Fe)OOH. Furthermore,
overpotential and Tafel slope were calculated to be 420 mV (Figure 10) and 23 mV dec–1, in good agreement with experiments, 300–400
mV and 30 mV dec–1, respectively.12b

Having established the idea that Fe could stabilize
the O radical
thus facilitating OER, Goddard further performed DFT calculations
to substitute Fe with other transition metals (groups 3–9).
And it was found that Co-, Rh-, and Ir-doped NiOOH could better stabilize
O radical and exhibited even lower overpotentials, 270, 150, and 20
mV, respectively.68 Although NiCo LDH was
proposed to have a better OER activity than NiFe LDH by Goddard, it
actually showed a poorer performance than NiFe LDH, which probably
is due to the smaller stabilization ability of Co with the formed
oxy (O*) group because of the larger number of electrons in the antibonding
orbitals of metal and oxygen π bonds, as shown in Figure 11. It can be expected
that lower number of electrons in the d orbitals could lead to stronger
metal–oxy bond; however, if the metal–oxy bond is too
strong, it is also unfavorable for OER, and that could be the reason
why NiMn LDH and NiTi LDH exhibited poor OER activities.

Figure 11 Molecular
orbital analysis of Fe=O and Co=O containing
complexes.

As Ni4+ is
responsible for catalyzing O–O coupling
due to its strong oxidizing ability, one can expect that if the oxidation
ability of metal is decreased, the ability of metal to catalyze the
O–O coupling should also decrease. In the first-row transition
metal, oxidation ability of metal ions with the same positive charge
would decrease because of its lower electronegativity. Indeed, changing
Ni to Co, we can see a decrease of OER activity, and that is why CoFe
LDH exhibited a lower OER activity than NiFe LDH.

7 Summary and Outlook
In this perspective, we summarized the
recent developments on OER
catalyzed by LDH. The basic criteria to evaluate the performance of
OER catalyst have been presented. Unary metal-based LDH has been discussed
to have a deep understanding of the intrinsic activity of LDH. Basically,
unary metal-based LDH is not effective for OER due to its poor conductivity
and absence of synergistic effect. On the other hand, binary metal-based
LDH is much more OER active. In particular, NiFe LDH is the most effective
binary metal-based LDH toward OER. It outperformed other Ni-based
binary metal LDHs owing to its suitable M–OH bond strength,
which is neither too strong nor too weak. And it exhibited better
OER activity than non-Ni-based LDH because Ni4+ has a strong
oxidation ability, which can facilitate the formation of O–O
bond. Finally, ternary metal-based LDH shows better OER activity owing
to its increased conductivity. Moreover, introducing divalent defects
leads to exposure of the Ni–O–Fe unit, which would greatly
increase the OER activity of LDH.

Although LDH as a promising
OER catalyst has been well studied
over the past few years, some critical issues should be tackled to
realize the practical application of these catalysts on hydrogen production
via electrochemical water splitting.(1) It is known that LDH with a high OER
activity almost always has a very high conductivity, but the underlying
mechanisms are still not understood. Moreover, it has been noted that
the conductivity of LDH depends on the applied potential.18 Therefore, the influence of conductivity on
the OER activity of LDH catalysts should be addressed systematically,
especially the intrinsic conductivity of LDH, the contact resistivity
between LDH and substrate, and the applied potential-dependent conductivity.

(2) The synergistic effect
between transition metals should be studied
further to obtain the fundamental details, instead of simply going
by the observation that the LDHs with more different transition metals
are more OER active. Nowadays, the synergistic effect between Ni and
Fe in NiFe LDH seems to be clearer, but the synergistic effect between
other binary transition-metal-based LDHs and ternary transition-metal-based
LDHs remains to be elucidated.

(3) Close interplay between theoretical
and experimental studies should be encouraged to tackle not only the
thermodynamics but also the kinetics and dynamics of the intermediate
steps of OER catalysis. For example, the key transition states leading
to the formation of OOH* and O* should be located to have a better
understanding of the kinetics of OER catalysis. For most LDHs, transition
metals will be peroxided before OER takes place. Thus, preoxidations
should be taken into considerations in future studies to have a better
understanding of the active phase of LDH, which is usually ignored
in the current practice.

(4) Most OER experiments are performed
in highly basic condition (pH > 13), but the OER performed in acidic
and neutral conditions with more practical utilization is less reported
and thus should be studied further in the future.
