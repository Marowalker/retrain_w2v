The role of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding
interactions upon the
nuclearity of palladium tiara-like complexes is reported herein. The
synthesis of three palladium tiaras is described with three related
thiolate ligands that vary in their hydrogen-bonding capability, amide
vs ester for N-acetylcysteamine (tiara 1) vs 2-mercaptoethyl acetate (tiara 2) or ethyl thioglycolate
(tiara 3), and in the relative position of the ester
group, 2-mercaptoethyl acetate (2) or ethyl thioglycolate
(3). Mass spectrometry indicates that, in the absence
of protic solvents, N-acetylcysteamine reacts to
form exclusively a six-membered tiara, [Pd(SCH2CH2NHCOCH3)2]6, 1, whereas
the ester containing analogues form both six- and eight-membered tiaras.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies indicate the significance
of intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen bonds in
determining the nuclearity of the amide-containing tiara 1. NMR studies indicate that 1 is not in equilibrium
with larger tiaras in solution, and that the smaller size of the aggregate
inhibits the fluxional behavior of the pendant thiolate ligands, typically
observed for larger tiaras. Electrochemical investigations of 1 reveal reductive processes that exhibit an increase in current
upon addition of acid, along with the formation of palladium nanoparticles.

Introduction
In recent years, toroidal,
or tiara-like, metal complexes have
received wide attention due to their fascinating structures and diverse
and unusual properties.1 Among the many
possible approaches to synthesizing such structures, metal–thiolate
complexes are attractive targets due to the strong nature of many
M–S bonds and the ability of thiolates to act as bridges between
metal centers. Additionally, metal–thiolates have been studied
widely in part due to their relevance to bioinorganic chemistry and
their central role in several key enzymes.2

Although a variety of metals have been employed to synthesize
tiaras,
including molybdenum,3 vanadium,4 iron, and cobalt,5 one family of metal–thiolate-based tiaras that have received
particular attention are those based on Group 10 metals, [M(SR)2]n, where M = Ni, Pd, or Pt and n most commonly varies from 4 to 12, with 6 and 8 being
predominant.6 In such systems, the metal
cations lie in a plane and are separated by two bridging thiolate
ligands that are located above and below the metal plane; the “arms”
of the ligands extend away from the ring, or occasionally in the case
of larger tiaras, fill the central void.7,8 The stability
of these complexes derives strongly from the M–S π-bonds.9 This is evidenced by the limited examples of
tiara-like complexes with an odd number of metals, where the resulting
structure has a mismatch of overlapping orbitals.9 Along with their catalytic activity for water reduction,10,11 tiara-like complexes have been shown to demonstrate nonlinear optical
properties,1 limited host–guest
chemistry,7,12,13 and suitability
as a precursor to monodisperse nanoparticles.14

It is clearly important to be able to control the nuclearity
of
such tiaras, as it can be readily envisaged that the resulting size
of the aggregates will have a significant bearing upon the properties
of the complexes. Although there exists an overwhelming abundance
of hexanuclear nickel and palladium tiaras reported in the literature,
there is considerable variety in the structures of the published complexes
and tiaras with sizes up to Pd20 recently reported.15 Modification of the thiolate ligands adds further
diversity to the complexes reported, particularly in the cases of
multiligand complexes.1,2,12,16 Thus, in this study, we report the influence
of ligand functionality on the nuclearity of such complexes and demonstrate
that through the incorporation of hydrogen-bonding capability, in
the form of amide groups, it is possible to significantly influence
the nuclearity of the resulting [Pd(SR)2]n tiara complexes.

Results and Discussion
Complexes 1–3 were successfully
synthesized by reaction of PdCl2 with N-acetylcysteamine (tiara 1), 2-mercaptoethyl acetate
(tiara 2), or ethyl thioglycolate (tiara 3) (Figure 1) in the
presence of a base. The ligands were chosen, as they vary only in
their ability to form hydrogen bonds, N-acetylcysteamine
containing an amide in contrast to the ester group of 2-mercaptoethyl
acetate, or in the position of the ester in ethyl thioglycolate in
comparison to 2-mercaptoethyl acetate. The samples were characterized
by spectroscopic methods, IR, UV–vis, and 1H NMR,
and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The latter provided valuable insight
into the nuclearity of the resulting products.

Figure 1 Thiol ligands employed
in the synthesis of tiaras in this study.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is helpful in determining the
nuclearity
of the tiara complexes from each reaction. Reaction of PdCl2 with N-acetylcysteamine (L1), using N,N-diisopropylethylamine as a base, in
different solvents (tetrahydrofuran (THF), n-PrOH,
EtOH, and MeOH) leads to products of different nuclearity (Figure 2). When using THF
as solvent, exclusively six-membered tiaras, [Pd(L1)2]6, 1, are formed. In alcoholic solvents,
significant proportions of eight-membered tiaras are also observed
and, in the case of EtOH and MeOH, masses corresponding to seven-
and nine-membered tiaras are observed. When MeOH was used as solvent,
a large range of different nuclearities are observed, ranging from
six-membered, [Pd(L1)2]6, to eleven-membered,
[Pd(L1)2]11, although some of these
species may be due to fragmentation during the mass spectrometry experiment.

Figure 2 MALDI-TOF
mass spectra of tiara products generated from the reaction
of N-acetylcysteamine with PdCl2, using N,N-diisopropylethylamine as a base, in
different solvents (from top to bottom) THF, n-PrOH,
EtOH, and MeOH. See Figure S1 for mass
spectrum of 1 in THF between m/z 0 and 4000, which confirms the presence of only the hexanuclear
tiara. For a comparison of experimental and calculated isotopic distributions,
see Figure S2.

Due to the success in producing solely six-membered tiaras
when
using THF as the reaction solvent for the synthesis of 1, we expanded our study to investigate the synthesis of related tiaras 2, using 2-mercaptoethyl acetate (L2), and 3, employing ethyl thioglycolate (L3) as ligand.
Characterization by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry reveals that whereas 1 forms exclusively six-membered tiaras, [Pd(L1)2]6, 2 forms both six- and eight-membered,
[Pd(L2)2]8, tiaras and 3 forms only eight-membered tiaras (Figure 3). If the nuclearity of the tiara was determined
simply by ligand length and steric profile, then 1 and 2 would be expected to behave similarly. Previous studies
have reported that methyl thioglycolate reacts with PdCl2 to form exclusively octanuclear tiaras6 and therefore the behavior of 3, which employs a ligand
of similar sterics to methyl thioglycolate (the ligand is simply slightly
longer) is less surprising. Interestingly, our studies demonstrate
that the reaction solvent has some role to play in the synthesis of 1. If THF is replaced by a protic alcohol solvent, such as n-propanol, then a small peak corresponding to the octanuclear
tiara [Pd(SCH2CH2NHCOCH3)2]8 is observed. On proceeding from n-propanol
to ethanol and then to methanol, the proportion of the eight-membered
tiara is observed to increase in relation to the proportion of the
hexanuclear tiara.

the synthesis
in THF of 1 (top, blue), 2 (red, middle),
and 3 (maroon, bottom) illustrating the different tiara
nuclearities observed in each case. For comparison of experimental
and calculated isotopic distributions, see Figures S2–S4.

For all three compounds, 1, 2,
and 3, single crystals were successfully grown by slow
evaporation
of solutions of the compounds in MeOH (1) or CHCl3 (2, 3) and the structure of the
compounds was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. For 1 and 2 hexagonal and for 3 octagonal
tiara structures were observed. In the cases of 1 and 3, this is consistent with the mass spectrometry data discussed
above. However, for 2, only single crystals of the hexanuclear
tiara were isolated, despite this being the minor product identified
in the MALDI-TOF spectrum.

The compound 1 was found
to co-crystallize as a hydrate,
with four water molecules per tiara along with a molecule of the crystallization
solvent, methanol (1·4H2O·MeOH),
whereas 2 or 3 do not form a solvate under
the conditions used for crystallization. The solid-state structure
of both 1 and 2 confirm the conventional
tiara arrangement with each Pd(II) cation bridged through μ2-S thiolate donors to adjacent metal cations in a hexagonal
ring (Figure 4). Whereas 2 forms a near-perfect Pd6 hexagon (>Pd–Pd–Pd
= 119.28(2), 119.75(2), and 120.96(2)°) (Figure 4b), distortion of the corresponding angles
(>Pd–Pd–Pd = 115.49(2), 120.71(2), and 123.80(2)°)
in 1 leads to significant distortion from the idealized
symmetrical hexagon (Figure 4a). Comparison of the cross-tiara Pd–Pd distances reveal
the distortion of the Pd6 hexagon in 1. Thus,
the shortest and longest opposing Pd–Pd distances are 6.0140(2)
and 6.4592(3) Å (average distance 6.217 Å) for 1 in comparison to 6.1366(5) and 6.2382(5) Å (average 6.194 Å)
for 2, respectively. As expected, the distances between
adjacent Pd atoms around the tiara hexagon are similar in both cases;
ranging from 3.0598(2) to 3.1730(2) Å (average 3.11 Å) for 1 and 3.0722(3) to 3.1179(4) Å (average 3.10 Å)
for 2.

average of 93.9°. Pd, dark blue; S, yellow; O, red; N, light

The main difference between the X-ray structures of 1 and 2 results from the hydrogen-bonding capability
of the amide-containing N-acetylcysteamine ligands.
Both intra- and intermolecular (tiara–H2O) hydrogen-bonding
interactions are observed. Within each tiara, six thiolate ligands
are bound to each face of the tiara. Of these, three adopt an orientation
such that the tail of the ligand is arranged approximately perpendicular
with respect to the Pd6 plane, whereas the other three
are approximately parallel to the plane. The perpendicular and parallel
orientated ligands are arranged alternately around the tiara, a feature
also observed by NMR spectroscopy, see below. A complex arrangement
of the intramolecular N–H···O hydrogen bonds
between adjacent amide groups exist between ligands that are perpendicular
to the plane of the tiara (N···O = 2.836(3) Å;
>N–H···O = 169°), ligands that are parallel
to the plane of the tiara (N···O = 2.901(2) Å;
>N–H···O = 168°), and between perpendicular
and parallel oriented ligands (N···O = 2.872(2) Å;
>N–H···O = 135°). The compound 1 co-crystallizes with water molecules, which participate
in hydrogen-bonding
interactions with the ligand amide groups. One such water molecule
acts as a bridge between adjacent tiara molecules, forming a pocket
that accommodates a molecule of MeOH that adopts hydrogen bonds to
the water molecules (Figure 5).

Figure 5 View of the hydrogen-bonding interactions adopted between 1 and water molecules that bridge adjacent tiaras. A MeOH
solvent molecule is accommodated in the pocket formed between
adjacent tiaras. Hydrogen bonds between amides and water molecules
are illustrated by dotted lines (N···O = 2.865(3) Å;
>N–H···O = 164°; N···O
=
3.027(2) Å; >N–H···O = 175°).

The crystal structure of 3 confirms the Pd8 tiara, as suggested by the mass
spectrometry studies. The structure
was found to exhibit a dynamic disorder in the positions of the ligand
arms, which is perhaps consistent with the absence of strong interactions,
such as hydrogen bonds, between adjacent ligands. The Pd8 octagon is distorted (Figure 6) such that the >Pd–Pd–Pd angles range from
130.38(2) to 140.21(2)° (in comparison to the idealized angle
of 135°). Similarly to the distortion in 1, the
cross-tiara Pd–Pd distances reveal the distortion of the octagon
with the Pd–Pd distances ranging from 8.2457(8) to 8.6039(9)
Å (average distance = 8.436 Å). The distances between adjacent
Pd atoms around the tiara octagon range from 3.1694(6) to 3.2741(6)
Å. An average Pd–Pd separation of 3.23 Å is observed,
significantly longer than the same separations in both 1 (3.11 Å) and 2 (3.10 Å). It is, however,
consistent with the analogous separations in octagonal tiara with
methyl thioglycolate ligands (3.23(4) Å).8 We conclude that with no significant intra- or intermolecular interactions,
the ethyl thioglycolate does not have a significant role in determining
the overall structure.

ligands have been omitted for clarity, respectively. The Pd–S
bond lengths vary from 2.296(2) to 2.352(9) Å, average 2.32 Å;
Pd–S–Pd angles exhibit an average of 88.4° and
S–Pd–S angles an average of 90.3°. Pd, dark blue;

We were interested in investigating whether the amide–amide
hydrogen-bonding interactions in 1 persist in solution
and whether any intermolecular aggregation of tiaras could be observed.
The 1H NMR spectrum in CD3OD of 1 displays six distinct shifts in the NMR spectrum consistent with
the axial and equatorial α-CH2, β-CH2, and CH3 groups of the ligands being inequivalent, as
has been observed previously for related complexes.5 Unfortunately, the signal due to the amide proton could
not be located, presumably due to exchange with the CD3OD solvent, and the tiara was found to be only sparingly soluble
in nonprotic solvents. Dilution experiments were performed to investigate
aggregation effects, but no changes in the NMR spectrum were observed. 1H NMR spectra of 2 and 3 similarly
show no evidence of aggregation, as expected for these nonhydrogen-bonding
systems.

The structures of the tiara complexes were explored
further by
two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy. As compound 2 forms
both six- and eight-membered tiaras, detailed NMR experiments were
not pursued further. The previously reported nature of the nonequivalency
of the axial and equatorial ligands in tiara complexes8 encouraged us to further investigate the 1H
NMR spectra of 1 and 3 by correlation spectroscopy
(COSY) experiments. Due to solubility differences, spectra for 1 were recorded in CD3OD and those for 3 in CDCl3. The 1H COSY spectrum of 1 (see the Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1) shows a correlation between the triplets at 3.57 and 2.67
ppm and those at 3.44 and 2.58 ppm, corresponding to the nonequivalent
axial and equatorial ligands, respectively. No coupling is seen between
axial and equatorial protons. Additionally, a weak coupling is observed
between the triplets at 3.57/3.44 ppm and singlets at 2.02/1.98 ppm
(see the SI). This represents a long-range
scalar coupling between the β-CH2 and terminal CH3 groups on the ligand arms, possibly enhanced by the character
of the amide bond; however, this could also arise from a favorable
conformation of the ligand thiolate arms resulting from the intramolecular
hydrogen bonding in the solution. 1H COSY NMR for 3 similarly reveals coupling between β-CH2 protons and terminal CH3 protons, but no longer-range
coupling is observed in this case, even between the α-CH2 and the β-CH2 protons, possibly due to the
replacement of the amide functionality.

The nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum
of 3 (see the SI, Figure S4) shows cross peaks of the same sign as the diagonal arising between
the axial and equatorial signals. Such signals could arise from either
a true through-space interaction or from chemical exchange; in this
case arising from sulfur inversion and axial to equatorial orientation
of the ligand, and vice versa. A weak signal arising between the quartets
and the triplets in the spectrum is also observed. This signal exhibits
an opposing sign to the diagonal, implying a difference in the nature
of the interaction and further indicating that chemical exchange is
the origin behind the cross peaks seen between the axial and equatorial
signals. As the nature of the origin of cross peaks seen between the
axial/equatorial signals could not be unequivocally determined by
the NOESY experiment, ROESY spectroscopy was employed, as cross peaks
resulting from through-space interactions in a ROESY spectrum (see
the SI, Figure S5) exhibit the opposite
sign to the diagonal. The same-sign correlations obtained indicate
that the two sets of resonances undergo exchange in the solution,
confirming the axial/equatorial nature of the nonequivalent proton
signals. Opposite-sign cross peaks are also observed between the quartet
at 4.24 ppm and the triplet at 1.34 ppm, along with a correlation
between the quartet at 4.44 ppm and the singlet at 3.39 ppm. These
are likely to result from the through-space interactions between the
β-CH2 and terminal CH3 protons via the
nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) rather than chemical exchange.

In contrast, the NOESY spectrum of 1 (see the SI, Figure S2) does not show chemical exchange arising
between the axial/equatorial pairs of signals. Whereas 3 possesses an ester group and no strong intramolecular interactions,
the amide in complex 1 possesses the capability for strong
intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, inhibiting axial/equatorial
ligand exchange. It should be noted that the spectra for 3 were recorded in CDCl3 solutions, precluding strong solvent–complex
interactions, whereas the spectra for 1 were recorded
in CD3OD, which is capable of participating in hydrogen
bonding, potentially inhibiting ligand inversion due to CD3OD···1 intermolecular interactions. The
spectrum does, however, continue to show a weak correlation between
the signals observed for the α-CH2 and the β-CH2 protons, indicating that a through-space interaction continues
to be observed. It should be noted that the interaction may arise
from a close spatial configuration between protons located on different
ligands on the same tiara.

Variable temperature experiments
were employed to further examine
the ligand configuration in 1 and 3 (Figure 7). The 1H NMR spectrum of 3, recorded at 298 K in
CD3CN, reveals a broadening of the signals observed for
the β-CH2 environments and the CH3 protons, for
only one of the two ligand configurations. On increasing
the experiment temperature from 298 to 338 K, the sharper signals
at 4.24 and 1.34 ppm broaden independently. On decreasing the temperature
of the experiment from 298 to 263 K, the broad signals at 4.44 and
1.56 ppm broaden further. Previous experiments have attributed this
selective line broadening to the movement of the axial ligand arm
into the center of the tiara. In contrast, the variable temperature
spectra of 1 (CD3OD) show a broadening of
all the signals simultaneously on the reduction of the experiment
temperature from 298 to 203 K. This is attributed to the smaller size
of the hexanuclear tiara compared to the larger octanuclear ring of 3, preventing free movement of the axial arm into the center
of the ring. The lack of asymmetrical broadening for this complex
indicates the presence of a single size of tiara ring, as larger ring
species would be expected to undergo selective line broadening.

temperature 1H spectrum of 1 in MeOH from

in ten degree increments.

Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) was used to confirm
the absence
of other sized rings present in the solution. Measurements were recorded
for 1 (CD3OD) and 3 (CDCl3). The data obtained approximate a nominal diffusion coefficient
of 3.61 × 10–10 m2 s–1 for 1 and 4.02 × 10–10 m2 s–1 for 3; the observation
of a larger diffusion coefficient for the octanuclear ring was unexpected
but rationalized by the lower viscosity of chloroform relative to
methanol and the slightly larger hydrodynamic radius, calculated using
the Stokes–Einstein equation, of 3 in comparison
to 1 (9.37 vs 9.00 nm, respectively). Comparison of the
experimental data and the predicted values generated by the calculations
provided by Morris et al.17 support this
rationalization. It should be noted that the DOSY method suffers from
several drawbacks when applied to tiara-like complexes. As these molecules
contain a large number of heavy (Pd, S) atoms, their molecular weight
does not correlate to size, as organic molecules typically contain
only elements lighter than sulfur. This is particularly notable when
considering rings of identical composition but differing nuclearities;
the molecular weight increases substantially on addition of 2[Pd(SR)2] units, but results in only a slight increase in the radius
of the complex. However, both sets of data provide linear fits and
are consistent with single-component systems, indicating the absence
of multiple sizes of rings in the solution phase.

The electrochemical
properties of 1, alone and in
the presence of either acetic acid (Figure 8) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Figure 9), were investigated
as solutions in N,N-dimethylformaide
(DMF) containing [NBu4][BF4] (0.2 M) using cyclic
voltammetric (CV) and coulometric techniques. In the absence of acid,
the cyclic voltammetry of 1 shows a distinct reduction
process at Epc −1.75
V vs Fc+/Fc, followed by a series of reductions at more
negative potentials (Figure 9). A less well-defined oxidation is observed at potentials
greater than Epa −0.29
V vs Fc+/Fc. This oxidation is independent of the reduction
processes. Bulk reduction of 1 at −1.40 V vs saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) (ca. −1.90 V vs Fc+/Fc)
gave a solution color change from yellow to red/brown and the passage
of charge corresponding to ca. 1.2 electrons per Pd center (see the
SI, Figure S6). This may indicate that
the reduction process at Epc −1.75 V vs Fc+/Fc results in the one electron
reduction of each metal center (the additional charge may indicate
proton reduction, vide infra). Maintaining an inert atmosphere over
the solution, the reduced solution appeared relatively stable.

addition of acetic acid (dotted line); (b) 1 (bold black

M) (solid

of acid concentration on the reduction current.

In the presence of acid, either acetic or TFA, the CV of 1 shows an increase in current for the first reduction process;
however, the magnitude of this increase differed significantly with
the acid. The increase is small for additions of acetic acid, and
there appears little change in either the potential for the onset
of reduction or the position of the peak current (Figure 8). By contrast, the addition
of TFA to a solution of 1 results in a significant increase
in the current obtained compared to the current observed for 1 alone (Figure 9). A shift to positive potential for the onset of reduction is also
noted with increasing acid concentration, although the position of
the peak current remains essentially unchanged. This may be characteristic
of protonation at the metal centers of the tiara. The presence of
a peak in potentials across the range of acid concentrations employed
suggests that the electrode process remains in the regime of diffusion
control throughout. However, a plot of Ipc/(scan rate)1/2 vs (scan rate)1/2 (where Ipc = peak cathodic
current) for these experiments does not indicate a behavior typical
of a catalytic process.

In the presence of TFA, the CV of 1 at negative potentials
results in a crossing of currents between the forward (reduction)
and back (reoxidation) cycles. This is not observed for acetic acid
(where currents were significantly lower) and may indicate the deposition
of a Pd film or colloid onto the electrode surface upon the reduction
of 1. Some evidence to support the presence of a heterogeneous
deposit on the electrode surface was obtained from an electrode rinsing
experiment (see the SI, Figure S7); however,
the relatively low currents observed from the coated electrode may
suggest that heterogeneous activity is only one, possibly small, contribution
to the total current. The bulk reduction of a solution of 1 in the presence of TFA (32 equiv) at −1.40 V vs SCE results
in the accumulation of sufficient charge to account for tiara reduction
and the complete reduction of the acid (assuming the liberation of
hydrogen gas). At this applied potential, it is noted that acid reduction
occurs in the absence of 1, although the rate of reduction,
given by the gradient of the Q vs t plot (see the SI, Figure S6), appears
to be slower. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the reduced
species revealed the presence of discrete nanoparticles, whose palladium
composition was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(see the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
Our studies clearly demonstrate the influence of intramolecular
hydrogen-bonding interactions upon the nuclearity of tiara complexes.
Whereas the amide-containing ligand, N-acetylcysteamine,
used in 1 can adopt hydrogen bonds both to other amides
within the same tiara and to external molecules, such as water in
the crystal structure, the ester containing ligands employed in 2 and 3 are unable to form such interactions.
Thus, the nuclearity of the tiaras formed by 2 and 3 is determined by steric factors with both six- and eight-membered
tiaras formed in the case of 2 and solely eight-membered
tiaras formed by 3. It is interesting to note that when 1 is synthesized in the presence of protic solvents, a mixture
of tiara nuclearities is observed, indicating that the protic solvent
is capable of disrupting the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and thus
lessening the influence of the hydrogen bonds in determining nuclearity.

NMR studies indicate that in solution, 1 is not in
equilibrium with larger tiaras and the smaller size of the six-membered
tiara inhibits the fluxional behavior of the pendent thiolate ligands
that is observed for larger, eight-membered, tiaras.8 Electrochemical investigations of 1 reveal
reductive processes with an increase in current upon the addition
of acid. The nature of the acid significantly affects the magnitude
of current observed, and there is some suggestion of the formation
of a heterogeneous Pd species on the electrode surface in the presence
of TFA.

Our studies demonstrate that by employing ligand design
that encourages
intramolecular interactions, the nuclearity of the product tiara can
be directed to give exclusively one product. Growing interest in the
use of tiaras for the synthesis of nanoparticles14 and as hosts for molecular entrapment7,12,13 requires the synthesis of complexes with
well-determined nuclearity. Our strategy employs a simple approach
to affecting the size of the complexes synthesized and avoids mixtures
of tiaras that are often encountered.15 Ultimately, we believe that by examining the influence of intramolecular
interactions, it may be possible to successfully synthesize tiaras
of specific sizes through careful ligand design.

Experimental Section
All the reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used
without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded
using a Bruker AV(III)400HD. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were recorded on
a Bruker Ultraflex III spectrometer. Elemental analyses were recorded
on a CE-440 Elemental Analyzer. For further details of electrochemical
experiments and TEM imaging, see the Supporting Information.

Synthesis of 1
To a
solution of N-acetylcysteamine (60 μL, 0.56
mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(97 μL,
0.56 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added PdCl2 (50 mg, 0.28 mmol)
and the mixture was stirred for 12 h. The solvent was removed and
the solid product was washed with diethyl ether. Orange block crystals

a saturated methanol solution (58 mg, 61%) and used for subsequent
