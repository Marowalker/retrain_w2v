Conventional
in vitro cultures are useful to represent simplistic
neuronal behavior; however, the lack of organization results in random
neurite spreading. To overcome this problem, control over the directionality
of SH-SY5Y cells was attained, utilizing photolithography to pattern
the cell-repulsive anionic brush poly(potassium 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate)
(PKSPMA) into tracks of 20, 40, 80, and 100 μm width. These
data validate the use of PKSPMA brush coatings for a long-term culture
of the SH-SY5Y cells, as well as providing a methodology by which
the precise deposition of PKSPMA can be utilized to achieve a targeted
control over the SH-SY5Y cells. Specifically, the PKSPMA brush patterns
prevented cell attachment, allowing the SH-SY5Y cells to grow only
on noncoated glass (gaps of 20, 50, 75, and 100 μm width) at
different cell densities (5000, 10 000, and 15 000 cells/cm2). This research demonstrates the importance of achieving
cell directionality in vitro, while these simplistic models could
provide new platforms to study complex neuron–neuron interactions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Highly
organized architectures with defined pathways are known
to be present in the nervous system, for example, chick and mouse
dorsal retina comprise defined canals, which are packed with axons.1,2 Similarly, in frogs, the dorsal column provides tracks that guide
the dorsal root ganglion axons after their entry into the spinal cord.3 Indeed, neuronal directionality is present not
only during development, but it is also essential in neural regeneration.
In mice, when nerve damage occurs to the peripheral nervous system,
axons regenerate along their preinjury path, reaching the original
branch points, innervating the same skeletal muscle fibers before
injury,4 thus highlighting the importance
of neuronal directionality in regeneration.5

Although neural directionality seems crucial for neural development,
functionality, and regeneration, their presence in in vitro systems
appears limited. Conventional neuronal cultures are mainly presented
in very simplistic homogeneous surfaces, leading to a disorganized
environment that lacks neuronal organization. However, studies have
demonstrated that neurons are highly influenced by their surroundings,
indicating a strong interaction at the interface between the cell
and the material surface6−8 and thus a high sensitivity to
the changes in their external environment. As a result, changes in
the chemical surface parameters, combined with the current advances
in microfabrication, have allowed the specific manipulation of surface
cues in cell culture, where the cells can be patterned in predefined
locations, at specific distances, depths, or widths.9,10 A plethora of nano-, micro-, and macrofabrication techniques have
been utilized for this application, including photolithography, microcontact
printing, ion-beam lithography, three-dimensional printing, soft lithography,
micromolding in capillaries, electrospinning, and microtransfer molding.11−14 Of these techniques, soft lithography is perhaps the most cost-effective
and user-friendly for patterning cells and proteins.9,15 Alternatively, photolithography is a method by which highly defined
structures have been created for cell patterning applications.16−18 Mahoney et al. cultured PC-12 neuronal cells on microgrooves of
20–60 μm wide and 11 μm deep produced by photolithography.
An optimal neuronal orientation was achieved in channels with a width
of 20–30 μm, whereas neurites extended along the channel
axis in the wider grooves.19 Rajnicek et
al. used primary Xenopus spinal cord
and rat hippocampal neurons to investigate the variations in neuronal
guidance through parallel grooves of various widths (1, 2, and 4 μm)
and depths (14–1100 nm) produced by electron beam lithography.1

Biological scaffolds are also routinely
used to drive neuronal
directionality. Natural matrixes such as collagen or laminin are routinely
preferred because of the bioactivity and the presence of cell recognition
sites. However, synthetic materials are more adaptable for these systems
because of the controllable physical and biochemical properties and
the wide range of materials that can be used for specific applications.
Various fibers have been utilized for neuronal alignment because of
their topographical effects, which include variable fiber size and
porosity.20 For example, electrospun nano-
and micropoly(l-lactic acid) fibers have been used for the
culture of neuronal stem cells. Albeit nanofibers obtained higher
differentiation rates than microfibers, they were shown to promote
both elongation and neurite outgrowth along the fiber direction, independently
of the fiber diameter.21

For chemical
pattern formation, the use of chemical gradients,
surface coatings, or extracellular matrix proteins can be combined
with engineering patterning methods to attain a spatial control over
cell growth.22,23 Previous research has highlighted
the application of patterning neuronal cells,24 and, more specifically, the patterning of SH-SY5Y utilizing a diverse
range of techniques.25,26 Typically, the most common methods
for patterning chemical functionalities include the use of soft lithography
techniques9,15 and conventional photolithography.9,17,18

A standardized methodology
for chemical patterning is based on
the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs); these thin, well-ordered
molecular layers are known by their simple structure, making them
a good candidate for chemical patterning for neuronal growth.27−30 However, SAMs are limited when it comes to using more complex and
diverse chemical functionalities, and thus the ability to self-assemble
long polymer chains necessary for robustly patterning cells is limited.30,31 Therefore, polymer brushes are emerging as a greater alternative
because of their packed structure and the broad range of chemical
and mechanical properties that they provide.32 These covalently attached polymer chains, or brushes, can be synthesized
utilizing either a “grafting to” or “grafting
from” approach. The “grafting to” approach involves
a chemical reaction between preformed polymer chains and a prefunctionalized
surface.33 This approach is often favored
because of the increased simplicity of the synthetic steps and the
higher accuracy of polymer characterization. The main drawbacks of
the approach are often cited as being a reduced grafting density,
as well as the stability of preformed polymer blocks.34 This research utilizes the “grafting from”
method, whereby an in situ polymerization occurs between an initiator
functionalized substrate and the reaction monomer. This approach is
often favored when there is a requirement for a high polymer brush
density. Limitations typically associated with this approach include
a more complex multistep synthesis, inefficient initiator surface
coverage, low initiator efficiency, and control over the rate of diffusion
of the monomer to the active polymerization sites.35 This may lead to a much broader distribution of molecular
mass across the substrate.36 Both these
approaches can be used for patterning cells at a higher complexity
by using a more diverse chemistry such as the attachment of biomolecules
or a platform to prevent cell attachment.37−39

The combination
of engineering techniques, surface chemistry, and
cell biology provides a tool for neuronal organization. The use of
neurons patterned in predetermined locations not only would facilitate
neurite directionality but would also provide a tool to produce a
more representative model of cellular interaction when compared to
conventional culture techniques, allowing for the generation of more
accurate in vitro neuronal models. This could provide new platforms
and approaches for cellular studies, while generating simpler and
refined models to study complex neuronal interactions. We have previously
established that surfaces coated with the polymer brush poly(potassium
3-sulfopropyl methacrylate) (PKSPMA) are nontoxic to the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cells, but prevent cell adherence, thus providing a candidate material
for patterning neurons into the predetermined locations. This polymer
brush coating has previously been utilized for a number of applications
including the support of lipid bilayers, polyelectrolyte brushes,
and hybrid monolithic columns for chromatographic separation.40−42 This material is of particular interest for cell culture applications
because of the surface charge carried by the polymer brush. These
charged surfaces have previously been shown to inhibit cell adhesion
by negatively interacting with the charges in the cell membrane.43,44

Full characterization of these PKSPMA polymer brush-coated
glass
surfaces has previously been reported, including functional group
identification via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic
composition and empirical formulae determination via X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, characterization of polymer brush thickness via ellipsometry,
and surface wettability via static water contact angle measurements.45,46 This paper also detailed the interaction between the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cell line and PKSPMA-coated glass surfaces, including cell viability
and cellular proliferation measurements, via alamarBlue and Quanti-iT
PicoGreen assays, measurement of neuronal morphology via immunostaining,
and MAPT gene expression via real-time-quantitative polymerase chain
reaction.

The research outlined in this manuscript presents
an approach to
control the directionality of the SH-SY5Y neuronal cells by the chemical
patterning of anionic PKSPMA as a cell-repulsive coating to provide
spatial control over cell growth. The chemical stability of the brush
architecture makes it attractive as a long-term coating for biological
applications. Additionally, the patterned polymer brush functionalization
(such as PKSPMA-coated surfaces) can be achieved on a diverse range
of materials, providing future scope for exploring new applications
in medical implantation, tissue engineering, or regenerative medicine.
Furthermore, the neuronal tracks created during this study will provide
a step toward the fabrication of materials that have the potential
to re-establish neural connections, allowing greater understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and also
neural regeneration.12,23

2 Results
2.1 PKSPMA Micropatterns
The presence
of the micropatterns on the surface was demonstrated by atomic force
microscopy (AFM). The height profiles successfully illustrated the
difference in the pattern height across the samples, containing the
preformed brush pillars and the noncoated glass gaps for the different
channel widths (for the noncoated glass gaps: 20, 50, 75, and 100; Figure 1A–D). Furthermore,
a change of color on the coated silicon wafers when compared to the
noncoated silicon wafers resulted in the optical observation of the
channels, where a gray/blue pattern could be observed when the photolithography
process was carried out (Figure S3). The
presence of PKSPMA brushes was further confirmed when neurons were
cultured on these surfaces (Figures S3 and S4), demonstrating a reproducible pattern protocol and also the excellent
properties of this brush as a cell-repulsive coating.

the patterned PKSPMA polymer brushes
on glass containing gaps of (A) 20, (B) 50, (C) 75, and (D) 100 μm
channel widths, containing the noncoated glass for cell growth. The
PKSPMA brushes are present in the pillars with widths of approximately
20, 40, 80, and 100 μm, respectively.

2.2 Effect of Pattern Size and Cell Density on
SH-SY5Y
To examine the response of the SH-SY5Y cells toward
the patterned surfaces generated, various channel sizes (20, 50, 75,
and 100 μm width) at various cell densities were examined (5000,
10 000, and 15 000 cells/cm2; Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 2 Effect of cell density and channel width on neuronal arrangement
for the SH-SY5Y cells. Patterned SH-SY5Y cells seeded at 5000, 10 000,
and 15 000 cells/cm2 in 20 μm (top row), 50
μm (upper-medium row), 75 μm (lower-medium row), and 100
μm (bottom row) wide channels. The SH-SY5Y cells were seeded
evenly and cultured in growth media (GM) for 3 days. To promote neurite
extension, the cells were consequently cultured for 3 days in GM.
Green = β tubulin III (microtubules, neuronal cell body), blue
= 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; nuclei). Scale bars
have been indicated in the image (for 20 μm, scale bar = 10
μm; for 50, 75, and 100 μm wide channels, scale bar =
50 μm).

Figure 3 SH-SY5Y cells seeded
on the glass/PKSPMA patterns at 10 000
cells/cm2 in 20 μm wide channels. When appropriate
channel width and cell density were attained, neurite directionality
and long extension were achieved. Green = β tubulin III (microtubules,
neuronal cell body), blue = DAPI (nuclei). Scale bar = 10 μm.

The variations in channel width,
especially from the widest to
the narrowest channels, showed an effect on neurite length, neurite
number, and nuclei alignment (see Figure 4A–C). However, the channel width did
not affect the cell confinement within the pattern (Figure 4D). Neurite extension was found
to be the greatest when the channel size was 20 μm, at which
the cells were seen to rearrange their cytoskeleton to fit in the
channel, exhibiting an elongated shape and extending neurites.

analysis of the SH-SY5Y cell patterns at different
cell densities (5000, 10 000, and 15 000 cells/cm2) and channel widths (20, 50, 75, and 100 μm). (A) Average
neurite length across the different channel widths and cell densities.
(B) Percentage of cells extending the neurites within the channels
at different cell densities. (C) Analysis of nuclei alignment within
the channel, where perfect alignment was considered at 0°. The
nuclei alignment data were normalized to the angle of each channel
and analyzed by IQ ranges. (D) Efficiency of PKSPMA patterns in constraining
the cells depending on the channel width and the cell density. The
number of cells within the channels divided by the total number of
cells presented in the image was defined as the percentage of cell
confinement. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD) of the mean.
Statistical analyses were assessed by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc method. Stars indicate
the statistical differences between the different channel sizes and
cell densities (p < 0.05, n =
4).

A reduction in the neurite length
was observed as the channel size
increased, perhaps because of an increase in the cells per channel
which led to cell–cell communication rather than neurite extension
(Figure 4A, p < 0.05 between 20 vs 100 μm for 5000 and 10 000
cells/cm2 and 20 vs 75 μm channel width for 5000
and 15 000 cells/cm2). This was also reflected in
the amount of cells generating neurites, where 50, 75, and 100 μm
wide channels had fewer cells containing neurites, although this trend
was nonsignificant (Figure 4B, p > 0.05). The nuclei were considered
perfectly aligned within the pattern when the interquartile (IQ) range
value approached 0. The cells were more aligned when the channel size
was 20 μm (Figure 4C), where the individual cells extended themselves across the line
pattern, showing a certain degree of neurite directionality. Thus,
there was a clear trend toward smaller channel sizes, obtaining more
aligned cells, when compared to the bigger channel sizes (Figure 4C, p < 0.05 for 20 vs 100 μm channel width for 5000, 10 000,
and 15 000 cells/cm2 and 20 vs 75 μm channel
width for 5000 cells/cm2). Cell confinement, which was
referred to as the efficiency of the pattern to contain the cells
within the channels, showed no trends with regard to the different
channel sizes. This was a further indication that PKSPMA brushes were
effective as a cell-repulsive coating, independent of the shape of
the pattern (Figure 4D).

Further analysis was also focused on whether the position
of the
cell within the pattern would be defined by the amount of cells used,
and hence various cell densities were tested for the several channel
widths (Figure 4).
The cell densities used showed a little difference toward the parameters
measured (neurite length, the percentage of cells generating neurites,
nuclei alignment, and cell confinement) across the different channel
widths. However, some nonsignificant tendencies could be observed
when comparing the different cell densities used. There was a greater
spreading of neurons and their neurites through the channel width
at the lowest cell densities (5000 cells/cm2) and less
aligned and spread neurons because of the overcrowding of the channels
at the highest cell density (15 000 cells/cm2).
Alternatively, the medium cell density (10 000 cells/cm2) seemed more consistent among the different parameters used,
resulting in both cell–cell contact and the possibility of
neurite spreading. Overall, these results indicated that cell density
did not affect significantly the different channel sizes and that
the 20 μm channel width showed the constraint of elongated cells
and was suitable for obtaining neurite directionality.

3 Discussion
The uncontrolled neuronal growth, as well
as the random neurite
sprouting in conventional in vitro culture conditions, prevents the
design of accurate biomimetic neuronal models.47 Because of the need for obtaining spatial neural organization,
micropatterning has been raised as a potential tool for mimicking
microenvironments.48−50 With such methodologies, a surface material can be
designed to adapt neurons onto various shapes and sizes, resulting
in potential advantages for neuronal tissue engineering applications.8,13,14

Many examples of micropatterns
published in the literature are
based on the use of extracellular matrix proteins, SAMs, or polymer
brushes.3,23,48,51,52 This work represents
the use of a PKSPMA polymer brush as a synthetic polymer coating which
has been shown previously to resist cellular attachment.45,49 By utilizing photolithography, it may be possible in future studies
to pattern PKSPMA into more complex geometries, potentially leading
to the control of cellular growth in a more developed architecture.
Because of the flexibility of the design available when using this
approach, various channel widths were utilized in this study to analyze
the effect of cell confinement, as geometrical constraints have been
known to influence neuronal morphology.23,53 The neurons
confined themselves across the channel widths, and neurite extension
appeared to be slightly higher when measured in 20 μm channels,
whereas lower percentages of neurons were aligned on 75 and 100 μm
width channels, respectively. Furthermore, neurites also appeared
to be aligned in 20 μm channels. Like chemical coatings, geometrical
constraints are also known to influence neuronal morphology.8 In a study performed by Nam et al., the SH-SY5Y
cells were seeded on polydimethylsiloxane substrates containing various
channel sizes (20, 40, 60, and 100 μm). The study showed that
in 20 μm width patterns, only two neurites were observed and
that these were confined along the pattern direction. The neurites
appeared highly aligned when measured in 20 μm channels, whereas
low percentages of neurites were aligned on 100 μm width channels.
In addition, the mean neurite length was small in channels 100 μm
wide, but as the channel width reduced, the neurite length increased.54 Smaller channel widths were utilized in a study
performed by Klein et al. This group showed the patterning of the
SH-SY5Y cells by microcontact printing in 5, 8, 10, and 20 μm
wide channels. Elongated single cells could be observed in this study
for 5, 8, and 10 μm wide channels, whereas double lines of neurons
were observed in the 20 μm wide channel.55 This contradicted the study presented by Yang et al., where
20 μm wide lines were shown to give single lines of the SH-SY5Y
cells.23 As observed in this current work,
the amount of cells seeded could lead either to the free outward spreading
of a single line of cells toward the 20 μm channels or to the
presence of various cells overlapping across the width of the channel.
Yang et al. also used two different cell densities, showing that cell
spreading was reduced when the cell density increased. In a work reported
by Klein et al., the cell density used was even greater than the cell
densities used in this current study (20 000 cells/cm2). The disparity between the studies could be that at high cell densities,
multiple cells can position themselves across the channel at the beginning
of the culture, meaning that the space to migrate across the channel
becomes very limited. Other factors such as the method of seeding,
the surface area occupied by the cells, and so forth could influence
the results. These results suggest that the constraints in cell shape
are greatly affected by geometrical constraints, but other factors
such as cell density could influence the neuronal arrangement. Such
a control on neuronal guidance could be used to underpin the neurological
processes behind the neurodegenerative diseases by the specific study
of single neuronal connections down the track, predicated by the ability
of the patterned neurons to produce functioning electrical connections.

4 Conclusions
The progress in microfabrication over the
years has allowed for
a multidisciplinary area where biology, biotechnology, and engineering
can work together to assess the challenges in material design and
cell biology. Its use in this study allowed for the flexibility in
the design, achieving the rearrangement of neuronal cells on different
channel sizes and various cell densities, obtaining neurite directionality
and elongation. The use of PKSPMA brushes was used as a potential
cell-repulsive coating, and its combination with the micropatterning
techniques resulted in a system with instructive cues for neuronal
guidance, moving away from the homogeneous and simplistic surface
presented in conventional models. The use of such patterns could be
essential to closely study the neuronal behavior; the micropatterns
could be controlled in order such that cell–cell communication,
single cell differentiation, or polarization could be monitored. Furthermore,
a more complex design can be utilized, obtaining more complex neuronal
networks for neurophysiological processes and for neuronal co-cultures
to study heterotypical communication.

mm) were purchased from Scientific Glass Laboratories Ltd. (Canal
lane, Tunstall, Stoke-on Trent, UK), and silicon wafers (⟨100⟩

and Alexa Fluor 488 goat antimouse IgG were obtained from Life Technologies
(Thermo Scientific).

5.2 Methods
5.2.1 Formation of PKSPMA Brushes by Surface-Initiated
Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization
The cleaning, aminosylation,
initiator deposition, and brush attachment have been described elsewhere.45,46 Briefly, the wafers and glass slides were cleaned with a UV/O3 photoreactor (PR-100, UVP). The cleaned samples were then
placed into a vacuum oven (Thermo Scientific, Heraeus) with approximately
10 drops of APTES in an aluminum foil tray alongside, and the oven
was sealed for 30 min at 25 °C and <50 mbar. The samples were
sequentially annealed in an oven for 30 min at 110 °C. For the
attachment of the BIBB initiator, the APTES-functionalized samples
were placed in tubes under N2 atmosphere, and dry tetrahydrofuran
(THF, 10 mL), dry TEA (0.3 mL, 2.1 mmol), and BIBB (0.26 mL, 2.10
mmol) were added and maintained in a static environment for an hour.
The samples were taken out and rinsed with THF, methanol, and distilled
water to remove any solid triethylammonium bromide which had formed
on the substrates. For the brush attachment, the KSPMA monomer (17.29
g, 70.2 mmol), methanol (20 mL), and distilled water (10 mL) were
stirred and degassed by bubbling through N2 for 20 min
in a sealed 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. After the complete
dissolution of the monomer, 2,2′-bipyridyne (0.651 g, 4.17
mmol) along with copper(II) bromide (0.0179 g, 0.08 mmol) was added.
The mixture was stirred and degassed for an hour, and then copper(I)
bromide (0.230 g, 1.6 mmol) was added. The monomer solution was then
transferred into tubes containing the initiator-coated samples at
N2 atmosphere for 24 h. After the polymerization was complete,
the samples were washed sequentially with methanol and distilled water
and dried under N2 (Figure 5).

5.2.2 Photolithography Process
The glass/PKSPMA
samples were patterned using photolithography, as described in Figure 6. An S1813 photoresist
(MicroChem, Chestech Ltd., Warwickshire) was spin-coated (Laurell
WS-650-23B) onto solvent-washed glass slides at 3000 rpm for 1 min
(Figure 6a). Lithography
was carried out on a Cannon PLA500 mask aligner with a chrome/glass
mask. The spin-coated samples were soft-baked at 115 °C on a
hot plate (Figure 6b) and UV exposed under an i-line (365 nm) with a power at ∼120
mJ/cm2 (Figure 6c),
before developing the samples using a Microposit developer (1:1 v/v
with distilled water). The developed samples were then hard-baked
at 180–200 °C for ∼15 min and left to slowly cool
down until room temperature (Figure 6d). The areas where the photoresist was no longer present
were used to grow PKSPMA brushes by attaching the APTES–BIBB
initiator (Figure 6e,f) followed by the attachment of the PKSPMA brushes (Figure 6g). Once the PKSPMA brushes
were attached, the remnant photoresist was removed by incubating the
sample in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Figure 6h). The resultant patterns consisted of parallel
PKSPMA lines with different channel widths (20, 40, 80, and 100 μm)
and gaps (20, 50, 75, and 100 μm width) containing the noncoated
areas. The pattern was confirmed under a Bruker Explorer AFM using
the SPMLab software in a tapping mode with a high resonance frequency
silicon probe.

process used to obtain PKSPMA/glass

S1813, (b) soft-baked, and (c) exposed under UV light through a mask
containing the channel geometries. Thereafter, the samples were developed
and hard-baked (d) obtaining the exposed areas of the noncoated glass
for the attachment of APTES, BIBB, and PKSPMA (e–g). The remaining
photoresist covering the nonexposed areas with the noncoated glass
was washed off with DMSO (h), obtaining stripes of PKSPMA and noncoated
glass.

5.2.3 SH-SY5Y
Neuronal Cell Culture
The
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line (European collection of cell cultures)
was cultured under GM conditions consisting of DMEM GlutaMAX supplemented
with 10% v/v heat-inactivated FBS and 1% v/v P/S. The cells were incubated
in a humid environment of 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C
until a 80% confluency was reached. The cells were treated with the
trypsin enzyme for detachment, counted, and plated evenly onto the
patterned samples at various cell densities (5000, 10 000,
and 15 000 cells/cm2). These samples were cultured
in GM for a period of 3 days, and thereafter neuronal differentiation
was induced by incubating the cells in differentiation media, consisting
of DMEM GlutaMAX, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% P/S, and 10 μM
of ATRA-differentiating agent, for another 3 days. The patterned samples
were then fixed and used for immunocytochemistry. Prior to experimentation,
the patterned samples were sterilized by incubation in 70% ethanol
for at least an hour and then left to dry under sterile conditions
in a biological safety cabinet.

5.2.4 Immunocytochemistry
The cells were
fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered
saline and subsequently blocked and permeabilized with 5% goat serum
(GS) and 0.2% Triton-X100 in 1× tris-buffered saline (1×
TBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, a solution with monoclonal
mouse anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:200 v/v) and 2% GS in TBS
was added and incubated for 2 h. This solution was removed, and Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1:200 v/v) was added along
with nuclear counterstain DAPI (1:1000 v/v), containing 2% GS and
0.2% Triton-X100 in TBS. The solution was incubated in the dark for
an hour, and thereafter the samples were rinsed with 1× TBS and
mounted onto cover slides using the Fluoromount Aqueous Mounting Medium.

5.2.5 Image and Statistical Analysis
The fluorescence
microscope images were taken using a LEICA DM2500
microscope with a 20× magnification objective. Five random images
were taken at the end of the experiment for every sample at every
channel size. The nuclei alignment, percentage of cells generating
neurites, neurite length, and cell confinement were analyzed for the
various channel sizes.

The nuclei alignment was obtained from
DAPI images using a customized Fiji macro (Java 1.6.0_24) image analysis
software (Figure S1). The angle of the
nuclei was obtained by using the channels as the reference point.
Consequently, the vertical lines parallel to the channels were considered
as the points where the cells were perfectly aligned (0°). The
nuclei alignment data were normalized to the angle of each channel
and analyzed by IQ ranges. An IQ range is defined as the difference
in alignment between the 25th and 75th percentile of measured values.
The measures were considered when at least three cells were in the
image.

To calculate the percentage of cells generating neurites
and cell
confinement, a cell counter plugin in the Fiji software was used.
The number of cells generating neurites divided by the total number
of cells counted was defined as the percentage of cells generating
neurites. Likewise, the number of cells within the channels divided
by the total number of cells presented in the image was defined as
the percentage of cell confinement. The neurite extension was traced
with “freehand” segmented lines and measured with the
Fiji image analysis software (Figure S2). The neuron protrusions were considered neurites when these were
the same or greater than 10 μm. All the data are presented as
mean (±SD). A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the channel data
followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc method to determine the interrelation
of the channels sizes over the different cell densities. The differences
were considered statistically significant for p ≤
0.05.
