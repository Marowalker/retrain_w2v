Pd-perovskite
(Pd-STO, STO = SrTiO3) was synthesized
by a relatively low-temperature (373 K) hydrothermal method without
calcination. The morphology of the Pd-STO could be controlled by adjusting
the H2O/NH3 ratio during the fabrication of
the amorphous titania. The Pd-STO catalyst showed better durability
for Suzuki couplings than did Pd-impregnated catalysts on conventional
supports.

1 Introduction
Perovskites
are low-cost materials with high thermal stability
and controllable physicochemical properties.1 Platinum group metal (pgm)-containing perovskites are well known
as “intelligent catalysts” because of the reversible
incorporation of pgms, such as palladium (Pd), into the perovskite
matrices. This reincorporation could maintain high dispersion and
prevent leaching or aggregation.2 Pd-perovskite
catalysts are widely used for various organic reactions, including
Suzuki couplings.3 However, Pd-perovskites
are still synthesized by conventional solid-state,4 coprecipitation,5 sol–gel
(Pechini),6 or alkoxide7 methods, which require calcination at an extremely high
temperature (≥873 K), and it can be difficult to control the
morphology using these methods.

Unlike the abovementioned conventional
methods, hydrothermal methods
have been rarely studied for Pd-perovskite fabrication.8 The benefits of this method are numerous including
the ability to control size and morphology, low-temperature crystal
growth, and no calcination required.9 In
this work, we successfully prepared Pd-STO (STO = SrTiO3) with a tuneable morphology via a low-temperature hydrothermal treatment
(i.e., 373 K) without any calcination. The Pd-STO catalyst also showed
better recyclability for Suzuki couplings than did Pd-impregnated
catalysts on SiO2 and Al2O3.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of the Pd-STO
Perovskite
First, we prepared amorphous titania spheres (ATS)
as described previously.10 Titanium(IV) n-butoxide (5
mmol) and aqueous NH3 with various H2O/NH3 molar ratios (Table S1) were separately
dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of 1-butanol and acetonitrile
(1:1 v/v). Both solutions were preheated at 353 K using a water bath
for 10 min. Subsequently, the hydrolysis of titanium(IV) n-butoxide was carried out by mixing the two solutions and aging at
353 K for 30 min under continuous agitation. The ATS(x) (x = H2O/NH3) was collected
using a centrifuge and then rinsed with ethanol and deionized water
consecutively.

The Pd-STO perovskite was synthesized as follows.
Typically, a Teflon vessel was charged with 2 mmol of the ATS, 2 mmol
of Sr(OH)2·8H2O, 2 mmol of KOH solution
(0.1 M), 0.028 mmol of PdCl2·2NaCl·3H2O solution (0.02 M), and 80 mL of deionized water. The vessel was
placed under ultrasonic irradiation for 10 min prior to the hydrothermal
treatment. Afterward, the Teflon-lined autoclave was closed tightly
and put into an oven at 373 K for 24 h. The obtained Pd-STO(x) was rinsed with dilute nitric acid (0.05 M) and deionized
water. The conventional catalysts (imp-Pd/Al2O3 and imp-Pd/SiO2) were prepared by an impregnation method
with the same Pd loading. After impregnation at 298 K for 24 h (in
ethanol), the Pd-impregnated catalysts were dried at 348 K overnight
and then used without any treatment.

2.2 Catalytic
Test
Typically, a Schlenk
flask was charged with 12.5 mg of the Pd-STO catalyst, 0.2 mmol of
4-bromoanisole (BA), 0.3 mmol of phenylboronic acid (PA), 0.4 mmol
of K2CO3, decaline (internal standard), and
2-propanol/water (i-PrOH/H2O, 1:1 v/v).
The Suzuki coupling reactions were carried out at 353 K for 30 min
(open air). The products were extracted with n-hexane
(2 mL), then analyzed by gas chromatography (GC Shimadzu GC-14B, InertCap-624
capillary column) and confirmed by mass spectrometry (GC–MS
Shimadzu QP2010 Plus). The spent catalyst was rinsed with i-PrOH, and the next reaction cycles were performed as described
above.

3 Results and Discussion
The amorphous titania (ATS(x), x = H2O/NH3) and Pd-STO are spherical, as shown
in Figure 1. Although
the particle sizes of ATS(12.5) and Pd-STO(12.5) were larger than
those of the other ATS(x) or Pd-STO(x) derivatives, the surface areas (SBET values) of these species were much higher (Table S1). The high SBET values of ATS(12.5)
and Pd-STO(12.5) are likely because of the presence of mesoporous
and/or macroporous structures (Figures 1 and S2). As described in
our previous reports, NH3 serves as a precipitation accelerator,
anticoagulant, shape controller, and condensation accelerator.10 A high concentration of NH3 in the
preparation of ATS(5.0) (Table S1) leads
to smaller and highly spherical ATS. A similar result was also obtained
using excess H2O (ATS(25.0)), which increases the number
of nucleation sites. In the case of ATS(12.5), an appropriate H2O/NH3 ratio can lead to larger particles (i.e.,
reduced anticoagulant effect) and slower ATS growth, which allow the
formation of mesoporous structures. During the hydrothermal treatment,
the Sr species will diffuse into the ATS and form SrTiO3 perovskites.11 The cubic SrTiO3 crystallites were easily observed on the microsphere particles (Figure 1e). Unlike the ATS
sources, crystalline TiO2 (anatase and rutile) could not
be used to form perovskites (data not shown). When refluxing at the
same temperature, the perovskite phase was not completely formed (Figure S1b).

(f) Pd-STO(25.0). Scale bar = 200 nm.

The Pd-STO perovskites
showed outstanding catalytic activity toward
Suzuki couplings and provided 100% selectivity (Table 1). The highest yield of 4-methoxybiphenyl
was obtained using the mesoporous Pd-STO(12.5) perovskite (entry 2).
Therefore, further studies were performed using Pd-STO(12.5) as the
catalyst. No further reaction after a hot filtration test confirmed
that negligible Pd leaching occurred (Table S2, entry 12). Further, poisoning or leaching tests for Pd are interesting
for the next study as described previously.12 Additionally, the use of a weak base, such as K2CO3, gave a higher yield of biphenyl than that obtained with
KOH (Table S2, entries 1–3). The
reaction also occurs rapidly with a turnover frequency of 7371 h–1 in 2 min of reaction. We observed that complete conversion
of BA (>99%) could be achieved by using excess PA (Table 1, entry 5). The Suzuki coupling
products could be easily extracted with n-hexane,
while the excess boronic acid or base remained in the water layer.
Various aryl halides and boronic acids could be easily converted into
the respective biphenyl species with remarkable yields (Table S3, entries 1–9). Aryl chloride,
aliphatic alkyl bromide, and heteroaromatic and methylboronic acids
(entry 10–13) were almost inactive. The coupling products (i.e.,
biphenyl derivatives) are important compounds for pharmaceuticals,
including antimicrobial, antifungal, antidiabetic, immunosuppressant,
antiinflammatory, and analgesic compounds.13

The Pd-STO perovskite showed higher
recyclability than conventional
catalysts (i.e., imp-Pd/Al2O3 and imp-Pd/SiO2) (Table 2).
The poor stability of the conventional catalysts is likely because
of Pd sintering because Pd nanoparticles can easily aggregate (Figure 2b). The aggregation
of Pd was negligible in the reused Pd-STO perovskite (Figure 2d), confirming its high stability
for Suzuki couplings. The perovskite phase remained unchanged even
after the third run of the catalytic reactions (Figure S1f).

Owing to the incorporation of Pd
into the perovskite, the X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Pd 3d5/2 peak intensities
of the Pd-STO were very low, as shown in Figure 3a (BE Pd(0): 335.2 eV and Pd(II): 336.9 eV).14 In contrast, the Pd peak intensities of imp-Pd/Al2O3 were much greater because the Pd particles were
present mainly on the Al2O3 surfaces. After
the catalytic tests, the Pd(0) particles on imp-Pd/Al2O3 were almost completely oxidized into Pd(II), which is less
active in these reactions. Conversely, the Pd(0) phase remained unchanged
on the Pd-STO perovskite. Based on these results, the durability of
the Pd catalyst could be maintained by the incorporation of Pd into
the perovskite using this facile preparation method.

In summary, the Pd-STO perovskite synthesized by this novel
and
low-temperature hydrothermal method showed high catalytic activity
and stability for Suzuki couplings. By changing the H2O/NH3 ratio, we can prepare Pd-STO with various morphologies that
are important in catalysis.
