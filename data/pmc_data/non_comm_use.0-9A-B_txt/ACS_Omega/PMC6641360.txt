Self-assembled
nanostructures of tyrosine-rich peptides have a
number of potential applications such as biocatalysts, organic conducting
films, and ion-selective membranes. In modulating a self-assembly
process of peptides, the interfacial force is an important factor
for kinetic control. Here, we present the formation of large-sized
and thickness-controllable nanofilms from the YYACAYY peptide sequence
(Tyr-C7mer peptide) using Langmuir–Blodgett and Langmuir–Schaefer
deposition methods. The Tyr-C7mer peptide showed typical surfactant-like
properties, which were demonstrated via the isotherm test (surface
pressure–area) by spreading the Tyr-C7mer peptide solution
onto an air/water interface. Uniform and flat peptide nanofilms were
successfully fabricated and characterized. The redox activity of densely
packed tyrosine moieties on the peptide nanofilm was also evaluated
by assembling silver nanoparticles on the nanofilm without requiring
any additives.

1 Introduction
In
nature, specific peptide sequences encode a lot of information,
drive structural assembly, and determine biological functions. To
mimic these complex biological systems, which are based on the specific
folding of peptides, considerable efforts have been made to fabricate
hierarchical self-assembled architectures including tubes,1−3 fibers,4−6 planar structures,7−9 and 3D networks.10−13 In particular, peptide-based two-dimensional (2D) thin films are
of great interest for a lot of applications such as biomaterials,14,15 surface coating,16,17 and electronics.18,19 However, various hurdles have to be overcome to fabricate thickness-controllable,
homogeneous, and large-size 2D peptide films for practical applications.

Recently, we reported that a tyrosine-rich peptide (TyRP) (Tyr-Tyr-Ala-Cys-Ala-Tyr-Tyr,
YYACAYY, Tyr-C7mer peptide) could be assembled into a closely-packed
and flat nanosheet form at the air/water interface, which could be
used as a template for the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole by
generated tyrosyl radicals.20 The challenges
here are (i) to transfer the nanofilm from the air/water interface
onto a substrate and (ii) to increase its size. As an easy and facile
transfer method of nanofilms from the air/water interface to a substrate,
Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) assembly can be utilized, which enables
the precise control of the monolayer thickness and packing density,
inducing homogeneous deposition over a large surface area.21−23 While Langmuir and LB films have been studied with peptides,24−26 most of the cases have focused on the structural analysis of the
peptide film rather than its function.

Herein, we demonstrate
a new fabrication method of thickness-controllable
2D nanofilms of a Tyr-C7mer peptide at the air/water interface using
Langmuir techniques. We further investigate the role of the Tyr moieties.
Obtained nanostructures of assembled Tyr show electrochemical activities,
similar to those of the photosystem II under physiological conditions.27,28 The LB or Langmuir–Schaefer (LS) technique can be used to
induce intermolecular interactions on a densely packed assembled nanostructure.
When the Tyr-C7mer peptide solution was spread on a metal ion containing
an aqueous subphase, metal nanoparticles (NPs) were formed on the
peptide nanofilm under neutral conditions. We demonstrate that TyRPs
are a versatile tool kit for the assembly of ordered nanomaterials
and metal NPs on them.

2 Results and Discussion
Generally, peptides that have been used for LB films appeared to
be amphiphilic. For example, surfactant-like peptide molecules,25,29 with a tail consisting of six consecutive hydrophobic amino acids
and a head consisting of hydrophilic charged amino acids, or β-pleated
sheet peptides30 comprising alternating
hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues were used for LB films.
All of them have adsorption properties onto the air/water interface.
It is rather difficult to assign a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic
head in the Tyr-C7mer peptide (Figure 1a). Nevertheless, the Tyr-C7mer peptide has surface-active
properties in water, as demonstrated in our previous paper.20

2.1 Surface Pressure–Area Isotherm
Surface pressure versus area (π–A)
isotherms of the Tyr-C7mer peptide monolayer on deionized (DI) water
can provide important information about the behavior of the Tyr-C7mer
peptide at the air/water interface. To get A0 value correctly, surfactant molecules are commonly dissolved
in a solvent that is immiscible with water. In our case, the Tyr-C7mer
peptide is not soluble in a common water-immiscible solvent. Thus,
we cannot but select dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for peptide dissolving,
which can lead to a partial loss of peptide molecules into the subphase.
Therefore, A0 values obtained from the
π–A isotherms are not absolutely reliable.
Despite these limitations, the π–A isotherm
of the Tyr-C7mer peptide exhibited a behavior similar to that of amphiphilic
β-hairpin peptide, which is slightly soluble in water26 (Figure 1b).

To check the phase change of the Tyr-C7mer peptide
at the air/water interface during barrier pulling, the peptide film
of each state was transferred onto a Si substrate and its morphology
was analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). For the deposition
of Langmuir monolayers of liquid-condensed and solid phases, where
the surface pressure is sufficiently high to ensure lateral cohesion
of the interfacial film, classical LB technique [i.e., vertical deposition
(VD)] is an acceptable method.31 The high-quality
transfer of a monolayer at a low surface pressure (gaseous state)
or of a collapsed one onto a solid substrate by the VD method is rather
difficult to perform. In those cases, the horizontal precipitation
(HP) method has been used.32 As shown in Figure 1b–d, Tyr-C7mer
peptide LB films were successfully deposited from the aqueous subphase
onto a Si surface at π ≈ 0 mN/m (lower pressure region),
π ≈ 7 mN/m (higher pressure region), and π ≈
13 mN/m (collapsed film region), which was verified through AFM analysis.
According to the cross-sectional analysis, the thicknesses of the
film in the lower pressure region and the higher pressure region were
found to be 1.0 and 2.3 nm, respectively. Further increase of the
surface pressure above π ≈ 13 mN/m resulted in film collapse.

It should be noted that the replacement of one amino acid in the
middle position by Ala results in crucial changes of the peptide properties.
The resulting Tyr-A7mer peptide did not show any surface-active properties
(Figure S2). From the result, we can conclude
that the Cys in the Tyr-C7mer plays an important role in the adsorption
property onto air/water interface.

2.2 Characterization
of YYACAYY LB Films
In our previous study of flattening water
droplet surface (faceting)
by the Tyr-C7mer peptide, we showed that a dimer formation via cysteine
oxidation (Cys, C) played an important role in the stabilization of
the peptide secondary structure.20 The
dimer content had a direct effect on the facet formation. To confirm
the effect of the disulfide bond on the Tyr-C7mer peptide film formation
via the Langmuir method, Raman analysis was performed. As shown Figure 2a, the −SH
stretching vibration (2571 cm–1) was observed in
the monomer but disappeared in the peptide film. Further, a new strong
peak (489 cm–1) appeared in the peptide film, which
corresponds to the S–S stretching frequency, as a result of
the formation of disulfide bonds between cysteines. The value was
shifted (−14 cm–1) from the 503 cm–1 band that was previously assigned to the S–S stretching frequency.20 The S–S stretching frequency and intensity
are sensitive to a changing CS–SC dihedral angle, therefore
providing detailed structural and conformational information about
various disulfide-containing proteins such as oxytocin, vasopressin,
gliotoxin, and malformin.33−35 Although various factors need
to be considered, it is possible to estimate the approximate CS–SC
dihedral angle of the Tyr-C7mer peptide dimer in Langmuir films based
on Raman data. Thus, the 489 cm–1 band corresponds
to a dihedral angle of about 20°, and the 503 cm–1 band corresponds to a dihedral angle of about 43°. As expected,
the pressure applied to the peptide molecules by the LB barrier affects
the peptide conformation and leads to a reduced CS–SC dihedral
angle.

Figure 2 Raman analysis of peptide powder (black) and peptide LB film (red).

To investigate the molecular conformations
of the 2D assembled
peptide structure, solid circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained.
As shown in the CD spectra of the peptide dimer sheets (Figure 3), strong positive and negative
peaks at around 200 and 218 nm appeared, which can be assigned to n–π* and π–π* transitions,
respectively. Those peaks correspond to the typical β-sheet
conformation of the peptide. An additional weak peak at around 236
nm is known to be related to the π–π* transition
of the disulfide bond.36,37 A deviation from 90° of
the CS–SC dihedral angle causes this peak to appear,38 which matches well with the result obtained
above via Raman spectroscopy.

CD spectra are
expressed in degrees of ellipticity (θ) without concentration
terms. Five layers of dimer sheet were directly transferred to a quartz
substrate via the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamping method.

2.3 Micropatterning
of the Peptide LB Film
It is of great interest to fabricate
patterns of functional soft
materials such as peptides and proteins for biosensors,39,40 tissue engineering,41−43 and fundamental studies in biochemistry.44−46 Patterned mono- and multilayer Tyr-C7mer peptide films can be easily
fabricated via stamping the peptide monolayer obtained by the LS method.
The common method of stamp “inking” starts with the
adsorption of “ink” molecules from solution. Previously,
we have developed an alternative way based on LB technology that allowed
the formation of patterned LB films of small- and large-size surfactants.47 In the present work, stamp inking was performed
via the LS method. This allows us to obtain Tyr-C7mer peptide LB films
with a flexible design as well as to control their thickness. The
LB film thickness was determined via cross-sectional AFM analysis
as the natural blemish depth. When the coating is highly uniform,
it is necessary to make an artificial defect in its structure, for
example, with the AFM tip while scanning a small surface area in the
contact mode at a load of ∼10 nN. The film material is supposed
to be completely removed at that location. However, it can be difficult
to estimate the extent to which the film material has been removed
from the required location. This is critical in cases where the coating
is sufficiently thick (tens of nanometers) or shows an increased wear
resistance caused by either high adhesion to the surface or reorganization
processes during scanning. In such cases, it becomes necessary to
increase the scanning time at high loads, which may cause considerable
probe damage and result in bad-quality AFM images.

Because the
patterned LB mono- and multilayers are formed using the microcontact
printing (μCP) technique, they consist of alternating regions
with and without films, and the coating thickness can be easily and
reliably controlled. Peptide film patterns of various thicknesses
were evaluated by cross-sectional AFM analysis (Figure 4). The film thicknesses of patterned 1-layer,
3-layer, 5-layer, and 10-layer peptide LB films were ∼3.1,
∼9.4, ∼15.7, and ∼33.4 nm, respectively. The
thickness could be easily tuned by simply controlling the number of
μCPs by the PDMS stamp. The thickness of the peptide LB monolayer
film obtained from the AFM data was compared with the geometric parameters
of the Tyr-C7mer peptide molecule, estimated using semiempirical quantum
chemistry method PM6 (length × width × height = 2.80 nm
× 1.45 nm × 1.10 nm) (Figure S4). These parameters were obtained from the most stable conformation
of YYACAYY in vacuum. The calculated peptide length (2.80 nm) is approximated
to the measured peptide LB film thickness (3.1 nm). The slight difference
between the two values might come from the adsorption of water molecules
into the peptide in the film. In addition, the monolayer thickness
of the LB peptide film is quite different from that of the faceted
peptide film (1.4 nm),20 which might be
attributed to the vertical arrangement of peptide molecules as a result
of monolayer compression.

2.4 Application
of Peptide Nanofilms for the Formation
of Metal NPs
To characterize the redox-active behavior of
the closely packed tyrosines in multilayered Tyr-C7mer peptide films,
cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in 0.1 M NaCl solution (pH 6.5)
with a Ag/AgCl electrode under the potential range of 0.4–1.6
V at 50 mV s–1, as shown in Figure S3. The largest peak current was obtained at 0.9 V,
which indicates that tyrosyl radicals are generated in the peptide
nanofilm (Tyr → Tyr•). To explore the possibility
of using the densely packed tyrosines as a bioinspired scaffold for
the formation of metal NPs, we attempted the reduction of silver ions
as a model reaction. A Tyr-C7mer peptide solution in DMSO (5 mg/mL)
was loaded onto the surface of an aqueous solution of silver nitrate
(AgNO3) (1 mM) (Figure 5a). From the π–A isotherm
of the Tyr-C7mer peptide monolayer on the AgNO3 aqueous
solution (Figure S5), we have found that
6 mN/m is enough to form a liquid-condensed monolayer of the peptide.
Interestingly enough, we noticed that Ag+ ions were reduced
to NPs on the Tyr-C7mer peptide film without using any reducing agents
such as sodium borohydride, hydrazine, or ascorbic acid. Through AFM
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses of the resulting
LB peptide film, we could confirm that the Tyr-C7mer peptide showed
a redox-active property even under neutral condition. As shown in Figure 5b,c, silver nanoparticles
(Ag NPs) covered the whole surface of the peptide film. It is known
that tyrosine in its unstructured and solubilized form shows reducing
properties only under basic conditions or at high temperatures,48−50 which has been demonstrated for gold and silver ions and graphene
oxide.50 On the basis of these findings,
we consider that structured functional amino acids could play an important
role for the metal reduction. The thickness of the peptide/Ag NP hybrid
nanofilm was 3.2 nm, which is the same as the thickness of the peptide
monolayer, indicating that the Ag+ ions did not affect
the peptide conformation. In addition, the size of Ag NPs was in the
range between 18 and 54 nm (mean and standard deviation: 34.3 ±
7.3 nm; Figure 5f).

obtained from Ag NPs on the peptide film transferred to the TEM grid.
(f) Enlarged HR-TEM image recorded from a red square in (e).

The crystalline property of the
Ag NPs was characterized through
a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image
(Figure 5e,f) together
with the electron diffraction data (Figure S6), wherein a plane distance of 0.21 nm, that is, the {200} lattice
plane, appeared instead of the most stable {111} lattice plane of
Ag(0) NPs in most cases. It is believed that the TyRP film stabilizes
the high-index facet of the Ag(0) NPs.

3 Conclusions
Uniform, thickness-controllable, and large-scale 2D nanofilms of
the Tyr-C7mer peptide were fabricated at the air/water interface by
barrier pressure and successfully transferred onto Si substrates via
LB and LS depositions. When an aqueous AgNO3 solution was
used as a subphase, Ag NPs were formed on the peptide nanofilm via
reduction of Ag by densely packed tyrosine moieties under neutral
condition without requiring an additional reducing agent. The 2D peptide
nanofilms have great potential for various fields such as biocatalysis,
organic conducting films, or bioelectronics.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
2-Chlorotrityl chloride
(CTC) (100–200 mesh, 1.34 mmol/g) resin, fritted polypropylene
tubes (Libra tube RT-20M, 20 mL), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and Fmoc-protected
amino acids were purchased from BeadTech Inc. (Seoul, Korea). N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), phenol,
thioanisole, and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) were purchased from Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Dichloromethane (DCM), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol, piperidine, diethyl
ether, and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Dae-Jung
Chemicals (Korea). Hydrogen peroxide solution (30%), sulfuric acid
(98%), DMSO, and CuCl2 were of analytical grade and used
as purchased.

4.2 Synthesis and Purification
of the YYACAYY
Peptide
The YYACAYY peptide was synthesized on CTC resin
(1.34 mmol/g) using Fmoc/tBu chemistry. Fmoc-amino
acid (2 equiv), HBTU (2 equiv), HOBt (2 equiv), and DIPEA (4 equiv)
were dissolved in DMF and used as a coupling solution. The coupling
reaction was performed in a shaking incubator for 2 h at room temperature,
and each coupling reaction was checked by the Kaiser test. After each
coupling and deprotection reaction, the resin was washed with DCM,
DMF, and methanol sequentially. To deprotect the Fmoc group, 20% piperidine/DMF
was added to the resin and reacted for 30 min. The coupling and deprotection
steps were repeated with Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, and Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH. After all
amino acids were coupled on the resin sequentially, the final peptide
was cleaved from the resin for 90 min by using the cleavage cocktail
(TFA/phenol/water/thioanisole/EDT = 82.5:5:5:5:2.5, volume ratio).
The peptide-cleaved resin was filtered, and the peptide-containing
filtrate was transferred to a round-bottom flask. The filtered resin
was washed with DCM and methanol to extract the cleaved peptides that
remained in the resin, and then, all filtrate and washing solutions
were combined and concentrated. To precipitate the peptide product,
cold diethyl ether was added and centrifuged. The precipitate was
dried in vacuum. The Tyr-C7mer was purified with reversed-phase HPLC
using a linear gradient of 10–80% MeCN (containing 1% TFA)
in water (containing 1% TFA) over 30 min and confirmed by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The purity was above 99% (Figure S1); ESI m/z: [M + H]+ calcd for C21H38N4O6S, 475.2591; found, 475.2593.

4.3 Surface Pressure–Area Measurements
The surface
pressure–area (π–A) isotherms
were measured with an LT-103 device (Microtestmachines
Co). It is a one-barrier LB trough with an effective surface area
of 253 cm2. Aliquots of the Tyr-C7mer peptide solution
in DMSO (1 mg/mL) were spread on the surface of DI water or an aqueous
ionic subphase (aq AgNO3 solution) and allowed to stand
for 20 min before π–A isotherm recording.
The dimerized peptide through disulfide bond formation is less soluble
in DMSO than the monomer peptide. Therefore, immediately after dissolving
the peptide in DMSO, the Tyr-C7mer peptide solution was spread onto
the surface.

4.4 Transfer of Peptide Films
Using Langmuir Methods
VD and HP were used to transfer the
LB films onto a Si surface.
First, Si ⟨100⟩ wafers were cleaned in a mixture of
H2SO4/H2O2 (7/3, v/v)
by heating to ca. 70 °C for 15 min, followed by thorough rinsing
with DI water and drying under a N2 stream. The precleaned
substrates were dipped into the subphase volume either vertically
(in the case of VD) or horizontally (in the case of HP). Thus, an
aliquot of the Tyr-C7mer peptide solution in DMSO (1 mg/mL) was spread
onto the subphase surface. After a stabilization period of 20 min,
the Langmuir monolayer was compressed up to the required surface pressure
and transferred onto the Si substrate either through slow (0.012 mm/s)
upstroke of the substrate (in the case of VD) or through lowering
the substrate into the subphase level (in the case of HP).

4.5 Fabrication of Patterned LB Films by μCP
On the
basis of the well-known μCP technique,51 PDMS stamps for μCP were fabricated by
replica molding using a TGZ3 AFM calibration grating as a master and
a SYLGARD 184 silicone elastomer kit (Dow Corning, Midland). Briefly,
prepolymer and catalyst were thoroughly mixed as a 10–1 ratio
(w/w). The mixture was degassed with a water-jet pump, spread as ∼1
mm thick layer onto the master, and then cured at 100 °C for
20 min. After cooling to room temperature, the elastomeric stamp was
peeled off from the master and used for μCP. The precleaned
Si wafer was touched by the “inked” stamp to transfer
the peptide LB film to those regions of the substrate that contact
the stamp.

4.6 Characterization
4.6.1 Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry
The peptide
film was dissolved in 0.5% acetic acid/methanol. Mass
data were confirmed by an analytical HPLC–ESI-mass spectrometer
(MS; Thermo—Finnigan LCQ deca XP MS ESI-MS) and a Phenomenex
C4 reverse-phase column (4 mm, 100 × 3 mm2). The gradient
was 10–65% acetonitrile in H2O with 0.5% formic
acid over 21 min.

4.6.2 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra
of the Tyr-C7mer peptide (monomer or peptide films) were analyzed
with a HORIBA Jobin–Yvon/LabRAM Aramis Raman spectrometer (diode
laser 785 nm, power = 1 mW). The film at the air/water interface was
transferred onto a cleaned Si wafer. The single transfer of film did
not give significant signals. Therefore, multiple transfers of the
films were necessary on the substrate. The scanned wavenumbers ranged
between 200 and 3000 cm–1 with 300 s scanning in
average.

4.6.3 Solid CD Spectroscopy
Solid CD
spectra of peptide sheets were measured with a J-815 spectropolarimeter
(Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C. Spectra were collected from 260
to 180 nm by using a 0.1 cm path length quartz substrate and keeping
the HT voltage < 500 V for reliability. The experimental conditions
were a 0.5 nm data pitch, a 20 nm/min scan speed, a 16 s response
time, and a 1 nm bandwidth. The data were accumulated from three repeated
runs for reproducibility. To acquire conformational information on
peptide films, peptide sheets were transferred onto a quartz substrate
by PDMS microstamping.

4.6.4 Cyclic Voltammetry
Current density
of the Tyr-C7mer peptide film on FTO glass in 0.1 M NaCl electrolyte
was measured, as the potential was sweeping from 0.4 to 1.6 V versus
Ag/AgCl electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.
