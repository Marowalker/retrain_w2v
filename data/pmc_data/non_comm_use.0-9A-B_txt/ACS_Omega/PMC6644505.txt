Fly ash usually contains a considerable
amount of toxic elements
that can be leached into the environment, thereby easily leading to
serious contaminations. In this work, the leaching behaviors of poisonous
elements including boron (B), phosphorus (P), vanadium (V), chromium
(Cr), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), antimony (Sb),
and tungsten (W) from fly ash were explored by sequential extraction.
Importantly, the associations of these elements in fly ash were discussed
based on their leaching and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
results. From the XANES results, it was observed that V(IV), Cr(III),
As(V), Se(IV), and W(IV) were their main states of existence in fly
ash. In terms of leaching results, large amounts of Mo and W were
leached into pure water, which indicated their high mobilities. Furthermore,
the occurrence of Mo in fly ash was mainly in the form of oxides,
and W had complex associations including WX4 (X can be
monovalent anions), its reduction state or association with the elements
that can be oxidized, and existence in silicates. B was as easily
released into the environment as Mo and W. It can have several associations
with the other cations, such as Ca2+, Na+, and
Mg2+, and occurs in silicates. In contrast, most of the
Cr and Sb were locked in silicates, indicating that they were very
stable in fly ash. In addition, P, V, and As can exist within the
structure of silicates as well. However, a considerable amount of
them leached in the reduction step with a low pH. Hence, they can
be associated with Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, or Fe3+. In terms of Se, oxidation processes played
an important role in controlling its leaching because of the oxidation
of Se(IV) to Se(VI). Calcium selenite should be the predominant form
of Se in fly ash.

1 Introduction
Coal as an energy source
for power generation has been used for
a long time. Every year, billions of tons of coal are burnt, which,
meanwhile, generates large amounts of fly ash that is regarded as
an industrial waste.1 If it cannot be disposed
off properly, serious environmental problems, such as water and soil
contamination and disruption of ecological cycles, would be easily
caused. Many aggressive efforts have been carried out toward recycling
the fly ash for utilization.2 In addition
to being used as an additive in cement, fly ash has been used in many
other applications, including road base construction, soil amendment,
and zeolite and geopolymer synthesis. However, these applications
are not sufficient for the complete utilization of the generated fly
ash. There is still a great deal of fly ash disposed in ash ponds,
lagoons, or landfills.2 The main harmful
aspect of the fly ash during its utilization or disposal is that the
toxic elements in the fly ash are likely to be released into the environment
when it comes in contact with water. It has been reported that the
trace element concentrations in fly ash are generally 4–10
times higher than their original concentrations in coal.3 Among the toxic elements in fly ash, the metalloid
elements are usually present in anionic forms in solution. Some metal
elements, such as vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W),
can also exist in the form of anions in aqueous condition. Because
of the negative charge of these ions, they exhibit a higher mobility,
which means that they can lead to environmental pollution and human
health problems broadly and extensively. Thus, more attention should
be paid to the control of anionic pollutants possibly leached from
the fly ash; this is imperative for a better understanding of the
occurrences of these elements in fly ash.

The possible chemical
associations of the trace elements in fly
ash have also been noted. Finkelman et al.4 proposed that arsenic (As) was primarily associated with pyrite
in coals, which later was decomposed during burning and gave rise
to a dominant surface association in fly ash. This was also confirmed
by Goodarzi and Huggins.5,6 Being similar to As,
boron (B) and Mo are also recognized as surface associations, which
means that they can be easily released from fly ash. Sulfur (S) is
a major soluble element in fly ash in the form of SO42– that has a strong relationship with calcium (Ca)
leaching. Selenium (Se) is an element that is most strongly enriched
in coal with respect to many rocks, and coal fly ash can be viewed
as a major source of this element.7,8 A view that
the Se species can also be in the structure of calcium sulfide was
proposed by Freyer and Voigt.9 Other elements
including chromium (Cr), antimony (Sb), and V are deemed to be associated
with the aluminosilicates (primarily in glass phase) in fly ash.5,10,11 However, Hansen’s research
implied that V and Sb were associated with the surface materials on
the ash particles.12 Phosphorus (P) was
believed to be extremely insoluble in fly ash,13 but there are very limited data available in the literature
supporting this viewpoint.14 In terms of
W, Vassilev and Vassileva15 detected soluble
scheelite in coal fly ash, and until now, there was no other report
on the occurrence of W in fly ash. Therefore, even though the research
on chemical associations of trace elements in fly ash has been considerable,
the distributions of these elements in fly ash have not been understood
comprehensively. There are still contradictions in terms of the existing
states of some elements in fly ash. Thus, in this investigation, a
modified sequential extraction procedure was adopted to explore the
occurrences of elements including B, P, V, Cr, As, Se, Mo, Sb, and
W in fly ash. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was applied
to determine the valences of specific elements by comparing with reference
materials. In addition, the properties of fly ash were characterized
by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and so forth.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations of Fly
Ash Samples
The particle size distributions of fly ashes
are shown in Figure 1. Except for samples
YEM and FAR, the yields of 100 μm of other samples exceeded
80%. For YEM and FAR, an approximately 40% proportion of fly ash particles
was distributed in the coarse size fraction (+100 μm), especially
for YEM. In general, the particle sizes of these samples were mainly
under 150 μm, which indicated that fly ash can have a large
surface area and may easily release pollutants associated on the surface.16Figure 2 presents the XRD patterns of the samples. The main crystalline
minerals are quartz (SiO2) and mullite (Al6Si2O13) in fly ashes. Other minerals, such as annaline,
calcium oxide, magnetite, and hematite, were also contained in some
fly ashes. At a diffraction angle of approximately 20–30°
in the XRD patterns, there were indistinct swell peaks, which implied
the existence of amorphous substances in fly ash. Generally, fly ash
contained a considerable amount of amorphous substances (generally
50%), mainly consisting of SiO2 and Al2O3, and this had been confirmed by another reference.1 The compositions and loss on ignition (LOI) values
of these samples are shown in Table 1. All the samples used in the study were from class
F fly ash [(SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3) ≥ 70%] according to the ASTM standard
(C618). Silica and alumina were the predominant minerals in the fly
ashes, and the total content of CaO was approximately 2% except DAT
with a CaO proportion of 4.57%. YAN had a higher value of LOI (8.63%)
than the other samples, whose LOI values were in the range from 3.60
to 7.03. This suggested that there was more unburned carbon in the
sample YAN.

Figure 3 shows the
micromorphology images of fly ashes. Normally, fly ash particles are
dominantly spherical in shape and mainly consist of solid sphere,
cenosphere, irregular debris, and porous unburned carbon.17 This was in coincidence with the SEM observations
of ZHA, YEM, NAY, FAR, DAT, SHU, JAP, and IND. However, spherical
particles cannot be found in YAN and PAN; instead, they were mainly
composed of irregular-shaped debris. This was because the fly ashes
were collected from fluidized bed combustion (FBC) boilers that provided
a low combustion temperature of 850–900 °C.1 Under low temperature, most minerals in coal
did not undergo melting but only softened, which led to the morphology
of the fly ash particles presented in the SEM images.

samples.

2.2 Valences
of Toxic Elements in Fly Ash
The elements of P, As, Sb, Cr,
Mo, W, B, Se, and V were the focus
of this investigation. B and P are generally present in the form of
BO33– and PO43– in solution, showing valences of +4 and +5, respectively. Thus,
their valences can be easily concluded in the fly ash. However, the
other elements can have two or more valences, and their valences in
the fly ash can have a significant effect on the leaching behavior.
Therefore, a better understanding of their existing states in the
fly ash would be very useful for predicting their extent of contamination
on the environment. The XANES technology can provide the valence information
of the elements in fly ash through comparison with reference materials.
The samples YAN (nonspherical particles), FAR, and JAP (spherical
particles) were chosen for the XANES tests. Figure 4 shows the XANES spectra of the fly ashes
and standard samples. A comparison of the As K-edge XANES spectra
(Figure 4c) of the
samples to the spectra of reference materials demonstrated that arsenic
was predominantly As(V) in fly ash. As in original coal was a mixture
of As(III), As(V), or As/pyrite.18 The
high temperature during coal combustion may lead to the oxidation
of As(III) or As(0) into As(V).18 It had
been reported that calcium played a key role in interacting with arsenic
vapor in the slow solid–gas surface reaction mechanism (eqs 1 and 2) that occurs in the post zone.19 In addition,
there was no difference in the valence of As among YAN, FAR, and JAP,
and this suggested that the oxidation process of As(III) or As(0)
to As(V) can be completed at 850 °C. This was also in coincidence
with the previous study.20 1   2

spectra of (a) V K-edge, (b) Cr K-edge, (c) W L-edge, (d)
As K-edge, (e) Se K-edge for the fly ashes YAN, FAR, JAP, and reference
materials.

From the Se K-edge XANES spectra
(Figure 4d), Se(IV)
was found to be the dominant oxidation
state in the samples FAR and JAP. For YAN, the spectra showed that
it contained a mixture of Se(IV) and Se(VI). Previous studies revealed
that selenium in coal was mainly elemental in form (Se0) or in an organic association with Se(IV) and Se(VI).21,22 Depending on the temperature and flue gas composition, Se can exist
in flue gas in thermodynamically stable elemental and oxidized forms.
However, elemental Se has the inclination to become the oxidized form.
Thus, Se in fly ash is mainly present in the form of Se(IV) (eq 3). At a lower stack temperature,
the oxidized forms of Se can be partially reduced in the presence
of SO2. The existence of Se(VI) in the sample YAN can mainly
be attributed to the high concentration of Se(VI) in the original
coal of YAN.23 3  

It can be seen from the Cr K-edge XANES spectra (Figure 4b) of standards that there
was a considerable difference between the spectra of Cr(III) and Cr(VI)
in the pre-edge region. It has a fairly sensitive fingerprint for
the identification of the valence states of chromium. The Cr K-edge
spectra showed that Cr(III) was the main state of existence in fly
ash. There was no change during the coal combustion process because
Cr in the original coal was also presentas Cr(III).24 Additionally, there was no difference among YAN, FAR, and
JAP; so, the combustion temperature had little effect on the valence
change of Cr. Compared with the reference materials, the element of
V showed V(IV) in fly ash (Figure 4a). However, V is present as V(III) and V(IV) in original
coal.25 Thus, the oxidation of V(III) into
V(IV) occurred during the burning process. In terms of W, it was determined
at the L3-edge and presented as W(IV) in fly ash (Figure 4e). Because the content of
W in YAN was too low to be determined on the beamline, its valence
in fly ash from the FBC boiler was not included in this work. However,
previous research15 showed that soluble
scheelite (CaWO4) was detected in coal fly ash, which was
in direct contradiction to the current study.

In this study,
the valence of Sb was not determined because of
the overlapping energies between the Sb L-edge and Ca K-edge. Because
of the limitation of the beamline, the Sb K-edge or Mo L-edge cannot
be satisfied by the energy intensity. Thus, the valence information
of Sb and Mo was not included in this investigation. From previous
studies, it is observed that Sb in fly ash can be present in both
Sb(III) and Sb(V) states.26,27 To a large extent,
this depends upon the sources of the original coal. Mo(0) can be easily
oxidized into Mo(VI) above 600 °C and Mo may be present as Mo(VI)
in coal fly ash, which needs further confirmation. Through XANES analysis,
the chemical states of some elements in fly ash have been known, and
this can provide new insights into the possibility of these trace
elements released into the aqueous environment. However, it is not
enough to make predictions on the leaching behaviors of pollutants
from fly ash in aqueous conditions judged only by the valence. Therefore,
a sequential extraction experiment was conducted to explore the leaching
behaviors and distributions of trace elements in the fly ashes.

2.3 Sequential Extraction Results
The
environmental behavior of potential toxic elements mainly depends
upon the forms in which they occur. Sequential chemical extraction
is an effective way to explore the fate of heavy metals in wastes
and assess their mobility and bioavailability. As can be known, F1
is the most readily mobile and has the potential for environmental
contamination. F2 would be easily released under weak acidic conditions,
and it can also be regarded as having good mobility in the environment.
F5 is expected to be the most stable for a long time in the natural
environment, mainly associated with silicates. Figures 5 and 6 present the
sequential leaching results of major elements including Ca, Mg, Al,
Fe, S, and P and trace elements including B, V, Cr, As, Se, Mo, Sb,
and W.

(e) S, and (f) P from different fly ashes.

Figure 6 Sequential extraction results of (a) B, (b) V, (c) Cr, (d) As,
(e) Se, (f) Mo, (g) Sb, and (h) W from different types of fly ashes.

Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, and S are usually
present in significant amounts
in fly ash. They (mainly Ca and S) play a key role in the pH of fly
ash leachate and promote the precipitation of metalloid-bearing phases
such as ettringite, which can incorporate environmentally sensitive
elements. Generally, Ca controls the leachate composition for the
most part and the leachability of trace contaminants to a large extent.28 From Figure 5a, it can be seen that most of the Ca content in the
examined samples was released in F1, F2, and F3, and there were still
small amounts of Ca in F4 and F5. This is mainly because some Ca can
occur as silicates.14 S (Figure 5e) was similar to Ca, except
that F1 accounted for a higher percentage, especially for YEM, NAY,
and FAR. However, the total content of Ca was 1 order of magnitude
higher than that of S, which indicated that all of these samples were
alkaline fly ashes. Mg mainly distributed in F2, F3, and F4, and the
proportion varied from sample to sample (Figure 5c). For YAN and ZHA, more than 60% of Mg
was released in F2 compared with other samples whose F2 fractions
were lower than 45%. This suggested that Mg in fly ash was almost
insoluble in alkaline conditions and appeared to be easily soluble
in acidic pH, which had been confirmed by previous studies.14 Al (Figure 5b) is usually abundant in fly ash. Although the content
of Al in fly ash was much higher than that of Ca and Mg, the magnitude
of the total amount of leached Al was the same. In the last step,
HF was used to dissolve the silicates, and the minerals of AlF3 and KAlF4 were formed. In these fly ashes, most
of the Al content was leached from F3 and F4, and this implied that
Al in fly ash had a higher solubility at low pH. Fe is also a very
common element in fly ash. From XRD patterns, it has been found that
it is related to iron minerals such as hematite and magnetite. Generally,
this element is not easily released from fly ash under the conditions
of pH > 1.5.29 The leaching results
(Figure 5d) showed
that most
of the Fe content was released in F5, and a small proportion was leached
in F3 and F4, which implied that Fe in the fly ash stayed in a very
stable state. These major elements usually control the leaching behaviors
of harmful elements such as As, Se, and Cr by adsorption or precipitation;
so, the possible associations with the major elements will be discussed
as follows.

P is usually insoluble under natural water conditions.
From the
results (Figure 5f),
it has been observed that there was a high concentration of P in fly
ashes ranging from approximately 150 to 1200 mg/kg. In terms of the
occurrence of P in fly ash, Jones30 suggested
its association with highly insoluble Ca phosphates. In this study,
low proportions of P were present in F1 and F2, which indicated that
P in fly ash was difficult to be released under natural or slightly
acidic conditions. However, once in a lower pH (F3: 1.5, F4: 2), the
amount of leached P increased dramatically. This may be due to the
dissolution of Ca phosphate, which was soluble in the presence of
HNO3. On the other hand, for YEM, FAR, JAP, and IND, a
considerable amount of P leached in F5, and this verified the point
that P could be associated with the silicate minerals, which was proposed
by Dudas.31 Therefore, the occurrence of
P in fly ash would mainly be in the form of phosphate and exist in
the structure of silicates. Compared with P, the total concentration
of As in fly ash was lesser than 100 mg/kg (Figure 6d). However, it has attracted considerable
attention because of its toxicity and mobility through a wide pH range.14 In all samples, F3, F4, and F5 accounted for
most of the As leached from fly ash, and this meant that As stayed
in a stable phase. Specifically, a larger amount of As (around 30–40%)
leached in F3 than that in F4. This may be because As in fly ash had
a valence of 5, and As(V) was reduced in the reduction process (F3)
and then easily leached into the solution. In addition, a considerable
fraction of As was released in F5, which was similar to that of Fe
to some extent. From previous studies,4 it is observed that As is primarily associated with As-bearing pyrite
in the original coal. After combustion, it condenses on the surface
of fly ash particles as sparingly soluble species.5,32 Therefore,
Fe controls its leaching behavior, as As has a high affinity with
iron minerals.23 For samples JAP and IND,
in addition to the characteristics described above, approximately
20% of As was leached in F1 as well. This may be because As was in
a soluble form, such as Na arsenate or K arsenate. Therefore, As in
fly ash can have associations including soluble and sparingly soluble
arsenates and existence in silicates. Being in the same group with
P and As, Sb (Figure 6g) is an element that is not fully understood in fly ash. Almost
all of the Sb content in fly ash leached in F5, which indicated that
Sb was in a major association with the silicates. Only a minor fraction
of Sb was in a nonsilicate association, which could be observed from
the leaching results of YAN, DAT, IND, and JAP in F1. Therefore, Sb
in fly ash existed in a very stable phase, and the total concentration
was in the range from approximately 10 to 70 mg/kg, which indicated
that it had little potential hazard to the environment. On the other
hand, as for the same elemental group elements, P, As, and Sb, the
possibility of leaching followed the sequence: P > As > Sb.
They are
difficult to be released from fly ash with the increase in time.

Comparing the same B-subgroup elements, Cr, Mo, and W, there was
no similar rule in their sequential leaching results because Cr under
acidic conditions is present in cationic form. The situations considering
the elements Mo and W also presented the trends similar to that of
P, As, and Sb. Specifically, the leaching behavior of Cr (Figure 6c) was, to some extent,
similar to that of Sb. The total concentration of Cr in fly ash was
approximately 100 mg/kg on average, and at least 70% of Cr stayed
in F5, which suggested that Cr was also associated with silicates,
which could be illite or spinel minerals, as proposed by previous
studies.11,33,34 There was
a small proportion of Cr leached in F1 to F4. As described above,
Cr appeared in the form of Cr3+. Therefore, it behaved
like some cations discussed in other studies.14,35 As the solution acidity became stronger, the leaching possibility
increased. For Mo, its concentration in fly ash was less than that
of Cr. The leaching behavior of Mo (Figure 6f) was opposite to that of Cr. A large amount
of Mo was leached in F1, which indicated that Mo had good mobility
in deionized water. Generally, the associations of Mo in the original
coal are mostly in the forms of sulfide (MoS2) and organic
compounds.36 During coal combustion, they
are then oxidized into MoO3, SO2, and other
compounds. Therefore, it is known that Mo in fly ash is mainly present
in the form of MoO3, which is easily soluble in alkaline
conditions. This provides an explanation for the above phenomenon,
as all the leachates of the fly ash in the first step are alkaline.
However, the leaching behavior of Mo in acidic fly ash would be different.
Under acidic conditions, Mo compounds generally cannot be dissolved,
but can be adsorbed on Fe oxyhydroxides (maximum at pH 3–4)
and Al oxyhydroxides (pH range 4–5).30 Thus, the occurrence of Mo in fly ash was mainly in the form of
oxides, condensing on the surface of fly ash particles. For all samples
except YEM, there were also small parts released in F2, F3, and F4.
Only in YAN, JAP, and IND, approximately 12, 5, and 6% of Mo, respectively,
leached in F5, which suggested that Mo was able to be associated with
the silicates. W (Figure 6h), another group member with Cr and Mo, showed leaching trends
similar to that of Mo. The concentration of W in fly ash was mostly
in the range of 2–13 mg/kg. However, for JAP and IND, there
were higher concentrations possessing approximately 160 and 100 mg/kg,
respectively. A considerable amount of W was released in F1, and this
implied that the association of W in fly ash may be similar to that
of Mo. From the XANES results, it is observed that W is present as
W(IV) in the fly ashes selected for the XANES tests. Therefore, it
can be deduced that the association of W during coal combustion goes
through both oxidation and reduction processes because of the existing
oxidative and reductive substances. In the case of W(IV), it cannot
be in the form of scheelite (CaWO4) as proposed by Vassilev
and Vassileva.15 Additionally, the oxidative
form (WO2) is a less soluble mineral in alkaline solution.
Therefore, the association of W in fly ash may be mainly in the form
of WX4 (X can be monovalent anions). In addition, a part
of W also leached in weak acidic conditions (F2), especially for NAY
and PAN. This is contradictory to the view that W is immobile below
pH 5 as proposed by Ward et al.37 Obviously,
the other fractions including F3, F4, and F5 accounted for a respectable
amount of W. W can be associated with silicates due to the less than
10% of W leached in F5. Step 3 and step 4 are the reduction and oxidation processes at
pH 1.5 and 2, respectively. After leaching in step 3, there was still
a proportion of W released in F4, which indicated that the oxidation
process may play a role in this element’s leaching. Thus, W
in fly ash has complex associations that include WX4 (X
can be monovalent anions), reduction state, or associations with elements
that can be oxidized and exist in silicates.

B (Figure 6a), the
same main group element with Al, with a content of 100–500
mg/kg, is also present in an anionic form in solution. To some extent,
its leaching behavior has similar trends to Al. The main difference
was that the element of Al was leached to a considerable amount in
F3 and F4, with low contents in F1 and F2; however, B was released
in a considerable amount in F1, F2, and F3 with a very small content
in F4. This suggested that, compared with Al, B was more easily leached
from fly ash in the natural environment. There are many researchers
who underline B as one of the most mobile trace elements in coal fly
ash.14 B generally shows the form of BO33– in nature, and then, in fly ash, it can
have several associations with other cations, such as Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+. Obviously, compounds that
consist of BO33– and different cations
have variant deliquescent properties, thereby leading to different
leaching behaviors under different aqueous conditions. These compounds
mainly present surface association in fly ash; a similar conclusion
has also been put forward by Querol.36 There
was always a part of B leached in F5. Particularly, approximately
40% of B was released in F5 for JAP and IND, and this can be best
explained by its cohesion with silicates. In some coals, B occurred
in illite or in the highly refractory tourmaline, as Boyd38 noted that the aforementioned silicate structures
can lock B up at high temperatures. Therefore, the main associations
of B in fly ash could be with cations, such as Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+ and cohesion with silicates.

In
terms of Se (Figure 6e), which belongs to the same main family as that of sulfur,
the concentration in fly ashes studied in this research was approximately
30 mg/kg. There was no Se leached in F5 except for JAP. JAP had an
extremely small amount of Se in the last step, which contributed to
the detection that Se might be associated with easily soluble compounds
such as CaSeO3 under acidic conditions,21 condensing on the surface of fly ash particles. In all
samples, approximately 20% of Se leached in F1 and F2, except that
Se leached more than approximately 30% in JAP and IDO. This can be
attributed to the occurrence of selenite in fly ash, which is relatively
mobile. Furthermore, there may be Na selenite (soluble in water) existing
in fly ash, in addition to Ca selenite (insoluble in water). Less than 10% of Se leached
in F3; however, more than 40% leached in F4. Under the Se leaching
process, the oxidation process (F4) played an important role in controlling
its leaching, as Se(IV) appeared to be the dominant species in fly
ash based on the XANES results, and it can be oxidized into Se(VI).
Compared with Se(IV), Se(VI) rarely associates with other cations
for precipitation and then exhibits higher mobility.8 Even though the XANES spectra showed that Se in FAN was
in the form of Se(IV) and Se(VI), there was no obvious difference
in terms of their leaching behaviors, which implied that the amount
of Se(VI) in FAN may be very small. From the comparison of the leaching
behaviors of Se and S, it is observed that Se is more difficult to
be released than S from fly ash, which is the same trend as that with
B, Al, P, As, and Sb. Therefore, it can be deduced that for the same
group elements, the element with a higher atomic number is more stable
in fly ash.

The total concentration of V (Figure 6b) was in the range of 40–200 mg/kg,
and it was an element that was not easily leached from fly ash because
there was only a small amount released in F1 and F2. From the XANES
results, it is observed that the main state of existence was V(IV),
which possessed both reducing and oxidizing abilities. A substantial
amount of V was leached in F3, except for JAP and IND in which F5
accounted for more than 60%. In step 3, there may be two reaction
processes including direct dissolution or reduction of V compounds.
These V compounds such as VO2 can easily dissolve in acidic
or basic solution. On the other hand, V(IV) in fly ash can be reduced
into a lower valance state [V(III)] and then released into the solution.
Thus, the reduction/oxidation process of steps 3 and 4 may control
the leaching behavior of V. A previous study4 revealed that V had complex associations in fly ash including surface
association, constrained in the magnetite or glass phase. From the
leaching results, it was observed that there was always a part of
V leached in F5 in all samples, especially JAP and IND. This certified
the above views that V could also be associated with silicates. Thus,
V in fly ash is mainly in the form of oxides and silicates.

3 Conclusions
The distributions of toxic elements including
B, P, V, Cr, As,
Se, Mo, Sb, and W in fly ash were explored using a modified sequential
extraction procedure and XANES. From the XANES results, it has been
observed that V(IV), Cr(III), As(V), Se(IV), and W(IV) are the main
existing states in fly ash. In terms of leaching results, Mo and W
were leached in large amounts in pure water, exhibiting high motilities.
The association of Mo was mainly in the form of oxides, condensing
on the surface of fly ash particles. W had complex associations including
WX4 (X can be monovalent anions), a reduction state or
association with the elements that can be oxidized, and existed in
silicates. B, being similar with Mo and W, was easily released into
the environment under acidic conditions. It can have several associations
with other cations, such as Ca2+, Na+, and Mg2+, and occur in silicates. In contrast, most of the Cr and
Sb were locked in silicates. In addition, P, V, and As can also participate
in the structure of silicates in a moderate amount, and a considerable
amount of them leached in the reduction step with a low pH. They could
possibly be associated with calcium, sodium, potassium, or iron. In
terms of Se, oxidation processes played an important role in controlling
its leaching because of the oxidation of Se(IV) to Se(VI), and it
was mainly in the form of CaSeO3 in fly ash. On the other
hand, through comparing the leaching behaviors of the same elemental
group elements, the rule that an element would become increasingly
difficult to be released from fly ash with the increase in the atomic
number was confirmed.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Coal fly ash samples including
eight samples collected from China, one from Japan, and one from Indonesia
were used in this study and were named YAN, ZHA, YEM, NAY, PAN, FAR,
DAT, SHU, JAP, and IND, based on their sources. Their original coals
vary from sample to sample. The fly ash YAN, ZHA, YEM, and SHU were
from the combustion of bituminous coal, and DAT, JAP, and IND were
from subbituminous coal burning. For NAY and FAR, anthracite was the
source of the original coal. There was also one sample (PAN) collected
from a power plant that used coal gangue as an energy supply. On the
other hand, most of them were produced at a high temperature (>1000
°C), although YAN and PAN were produced at 850–900 °C,
which led to different morphologies (Figure 3). All samples were collected through a scientific
procedure, mixed homogeneously, and then stored in a dry cabinet.

4.2 Sequential Extraction Procedure
A
five-step extraction procedure used in the research was modified from
the extraction procedure proposed by the Commission of the European
Communities (BCR),39−41 as shown in Table 2. This procedure differentiated elements into several
behavioral fractions including the water-soluble fraction (F1), acid-soluble
fraction (F2), reducible fraction (F3), oxidizable fraction (F4),
and silicate fraction (F5). At the fifth step, to decompose the silicate
minerals in fly ash, HF (46%, Wako) was used with HNO3 (60%,
Kanto industry) and H2O2 (46%, Wako) under microwave
conditions (Milestone ETHOS). In addition, CH3COOH (99%)
and NH2OH·HCl (95%) were also purchased from Wako
industry (Osaka, Japan). The specific experimental procedure was as
follows: 1 g of each fly ash was separately taken and placed in 50
mL polypropylene bottles, and no delay occurred between the addition
of extractant solution and the beginning of the shaking. At the same
time, five parallel tests were done to collect the solid residues
from every step. All the leaching tests were conducted with a shaker
(MM-10) at a speed of 100 rpm at 25 °C. The extracts were separated
from the solid residues by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min,
and the supernatant liquid was decanted into polyethylene tubes. Membrane
filters (0.20 μm) were used to remove fine particles from the
supernatant, which were then stored in a refrigerator for later analysis.
The solid residues collected from every step were washed by adding
20 mL of deionized water and shaked for 15 min, and the supernatants
separated by centrifugation were discarded. The solid residues were
then used for the next step of leaching.

4.3 Instrumentation
A laser particle
analyzer (Horiba LA950) was used to determine the particle size distribution
of fly ash. XRF spectroscopy (Rigaku ZSX Primus II) and TG-DTA (2000
SA thermal balance, Bruker, Germany) were adopted to analyze the composition
and LOI of the fly ash. The heating rate and airflow were 10 °C/min
and 100 mL/min, respectively. The element concentrations in the extracts
were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer
(PerkinElmer, Optima 8300, US). The solid phases in the fly ash and
leaching residues were characterized by a Rigaku Ultima IV XRD (Akishima,
Japan): Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA) with a Ni filter at a scanning
speed of 2° min–1 and a scanning step of 0.02°.
The SEM observations were carried out by a VE-9800 scanning electron
microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of
20 kV.

The XANES spectra of fly ashes including YAN, FAR, and
JAP were collected at room temperature on a BL-06 beamline at the
SAGA Light Source (Tosu, Japan). The electron storage ring operated
with an energy of 1.4 GeV, and a silicon (111) double-crystal monochromator
was used to obtain the incident X-ray beam. The energy range of this
light source is 2.1–23 keV. The typical photon flux is 1010 photons/s. The intensities of the fluorescence X-rays were
monitored with a silicon drift detector and an ionization chamber.
Specifically, the XANES region extending from approximately −50
to +50 electron volts (eV) was collected in the fluorescence mode,
which can provide information about the valences of the target elements
in fly ash through comparison with the reference materials. In this
test, the elements including Cr, As, Se, W, and V were explored for
their valences occurring in the fly ash. Accordingly, the XANES spectra
of known reference materials including CrCl3, Na2CrO4, NaAsO2, KHAsO4, Se, Na2SeO3, Na2SeO4, WC, Na2WO4, V2O3, VOSO4·H2O, and V2O5 were measured
on the beamline. The data processing was carried out on the ATHENA,
which is an independent package of IFEFFIT.42
