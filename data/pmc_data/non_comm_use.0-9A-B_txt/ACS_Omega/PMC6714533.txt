In this report, a series of amorphous organic optoelectronic
pyrene–fluorene derivative materials (BP1, BP2, PFP1, PFP2,
OP1, OP2) were systematically investigated through a theoretical method.
Their molecular structures are different due to the difference of
substitution groups at C9 of the fluorene core, which include electron-rich
pyrene group (PFP1 and PFP2), relatively neutral phenyl group (BP1
and BP2), and electron-withdrawing oxadiazole group (OP1 and OP2).
In the beginning, through the physical model analysis, this report
proposes that the concept of p-type or n-type is not flawless because
there is no real doping process in these molecular organic semiconductors.
To prove such a concept, the Marcus theory and first-principles were
employed to calculate the intrinsic transfer mobility of these materials.
Not as the common method used for the single crystal, in this report,
a series of disorderly designed lattice cells were constructed to
represent the disordered distribution of the amorphous pyrenyl–fluorene
derivatives. Then, the reorganization energy of materials was calculated
by the adiabatic potential energy surface method. The transfer integral
of dimers was calculated in possible hopping pathways near the central
molecule. Research results show that the six pyrene–fluorene
materials all possess intrinsic bipolar transfer characteristics.
In addition, it is also showed that the electron-rich group is not
necessary to improve hole transfer, and that the electron-withdrawing
group is also not necessary to improve electron transfer.

1 Introduction
Due to the application in the fields of organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1,2 organic field-effect
transistors (OFETs),3,4 organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs),5 π-conjugated organic semiconductors (OSCs)
recently have received extensive attention in industrial and scientific
community. Compared with traditional inorganic semiconductors, OSCs
show some superior qualities, which include low-device-fabrication
cost especially for spin-coating, a variety of materials for different
applications due to easy molecular engineering and mechanical flexibility.
Obviously, from the performance principle of organic photoelectronics,
the charge-transfer process plays a vital role in all optoelectronic
devices. Besides the charge-transfer investigation on the common commercial
OSCs, the newly synthesized materials should be focused on since their
amount is greatly larger than the commercial materials. During then,
after years of research on pyrene–fluorene derivatives,6−8 our group discovered the π–π
hyperconjugation effect,9,10 which means the electron
cloud of two isolated conjugation systems (nonconjugated pyrene group
and pyrene–fluorene group) could be delocalized and transferred
to each other. Then, the further exploration of the inner charge transfer
in such materials is necessary for their further application.

So in this work, from the viewpoint of energy level structure, charge
(electron and hole) transfer of a series of amorphous pyrene–fluorene
derivatives (BP1, BP2, PFP1, PFP2, OP1, OP2) is theoretically investigated.
The chemical structures of the studied materials are shown in Figure 1. From the molecular
structure, if the pyrene–fluorene is considered to be the main
conjugation, there are three different aromatic group substitutions
on the C9 of the central fluorene core. Then, the phenyl group could
be considered to be a relatively neutral group (in BP1 and BP2) because
that the pyrenyl group could be electron-rich group and the oxadiazole
group could be electron-withdrawing group compared with the phenyl
group. In common sense in OSCs, the BP1 and BP2 are the p-type materials
for hole transporting. The incorporation of electron-rich group will
lead to more “p-type” and, thus, larger hole transport
(PFP1 and PFP2). To systematically compare, oxadiazole group has also
been incorporated as the electron-withdrawing group (OP1 and OP2),
which should be the n-type and electron transfer according to the
general concept. Among these compounds, BP1, BP2, PFP1, and PFP2 have
been synthesized in our previous work,10 OP1 and OP2 with oxadiazole substitution are just theoretically
designed up to now.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
the monomers of the studied amorphous materials.

In the traditional inorganic semiconductors
such as classical single-crystal silicon, they can function as p-type
or n-type. A p-type semiconductor is formed by doping a trivalent
element (such as boron) into a pure silicon crystal to replace the
position of the silicon atom in the crystal lattice. Correspondingly,
an n-type semiconductor is formed by doping a pentavalent element
(such as phosphorus) into a pure silicon crystal to replace the position
of the silicon atom in the crystal lattice. In an n-type semiconductor,
electrons are majority carrier, and holes are minority carriers. As
to the p-type semiconductor, its hole concentration is much larger
than that of the electron. Moreover, the current definition of organic
semiconductors is also extended by these traditional concepts just
as the above description.11

When
a simple physical model is used to describe the carrier transport
in OSC (OPV in this scheme), the charge transfer is mainly divided
into three steps, as shown in Figure 2, where two molecules (PFP1 and OP1) are presented
for a clear description. First, the electron is excited from the hole–electron
pair in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the molecule
to its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). After the transition,
the electron–hole pair is separated. Second, the electron is
transferred in the LUMO and the remaining hole is transferred in the
HOMO in the same molecule. Third, the electron is transferred in the
LUMO to the LUMO of another molecule. The hole in the HOMO is also
transported to the other HOMO of the next molecule. The general intermolecular
charge transfer in room temperature and amorphous organic materials
can be described through the hopping model. During the whole process,
the electron concentration should be the same to the hole concentration
since they are the original electron–hole pair. There is no
theoretical difference between the charge transport in HOMO and LUMO
since the difference is only the energy level. The only difference
might occur in the intermolecular hopping process. Does the great
thermal lattice fluctuation in amorphous OSCs have the same or different
influence on the electron and hole transport? If it is the same or
similar, then all of the undoped molecules in this report should be
intrinsic bipolar transport in contrast to the traditional p- or n-type.

Figure 2 Process of charge transfer
in PFP1 and OP1.

Common charge-transfer studies on OLEDs, OPVs, and OFETs always
have the effect of the external electric field, such as the incorporation
of two or three electrodes, cathode modification, and so on.12,13 It should be noted that the external electrical field will seriously
influence the transport characteristics, especially in the three-electrode
OFETs. Besides the organic semiconducting molecules, there are additional
electrodes, insulating materials, and the corresponding interfaces
to affect the transfer in OSCs. To make sure that the research target
is organic molecules themselves and to avoid these external influencing
factors, it is necessary to explore carrier transport in amorphous
pyrene–fluorene derivatives from purely theoretical research.
The results of the research show that they are all intrinsic bipolar
OSCs, which will lead to an idea change in their application in the
organic photoelectronics.

2 Theoretical Method
The molecules researched in this report
are all amorphous, so the charge-transfer process can be explained
by the hopping model, during which the semiempirical Marcus–Hush
theory is the most representative one. It can be used to explain the
carrier transport rate between adjacent molecules, following the formula
M+ + M → M + M+, where M represents a
neutral molecule and M+ represents an adjacent ionized
molecule.14 There are already lots of researches
about the charge-transfer properties of OSC crystals in recent years.15−19 However, although most OSCs are amorphous,
the lack of research on newly designed and synthesized amorphous OSCs
in the hopping model is still the reality in the field of organic
photoelectronics up to now.

Under this model, the disordered
distribution of the material can be expressed in terms of a three-dimensional
space. Then, a series of representative cell lattices are constructed
to represent the disordered distribution of materials. These cell
lattices are disorderly designed to be large enough, and then one
single molecule is selected as the central molecule in the lattice.
Such a molecule and the adjacent molecule form lots of two-molecules
(dimers, so-called amorphous cell), which could represent the minimum
periodic unit of the real molecule pattern. Next, for each cell lattice,
the charge-transfer rate was investigated between the dimers. The
sum of these data gives the electron or hole mobility of the cell
lattice, which is considered as the simulated intrinsic mobility of
these materials.20 This method avoids the
assumption of isotropy since the disordered distribution generally
exists in most of OSCs.

First, the geometry of all molecules
(in Figure 1) was optimized
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Then, the construction of the amorphous
cell and forcite modules of Accelrys’ Materials Studio 8.0
programs were used to generate amorphous cell representations of BP1,
BP2, PFP1, PFP2, OP1, and OP2. None of these amorphous organic materials
studied here has the experimental density values. We use Rigby’s
developed program21 to relatively accurately
determine the material density. The molecular monomer structure shown
in Figure 1 was first
optimized using molecular mechanics and the COMPASS force field.22 Cubic amorphous cells (10) were prepared for
each molecule. Each cell is filled with enough optimized monomer molecules
to reach about 1600 atoms per cell. The initially selected cubic lattice
parameter is a density close to 1 g/cm3, and the cells
are energy-minimized after generation. Then, each cell was experienced
four consecutive molecular dynamics processes, and all dynamic runs
had a time step of 1 fs. First, running at a constant volume and temperature
(NVT) run of 10 000 steps; second, with the Andersen thermostat
for NVT operation 40 000 steps; then, constant pressure and
temperature (NPT) is 10 000 steps; the last NPT process is
100 000 steps; the NPT process utilized both Andersen thermostats
and Berendsen barostat and an additional pressure of 0.0001 GPa. A
complete atomic coordinate system is written in every thousand steps
of the production run, which is used to calculate the average density
and its standard deviation. The calculated densities of BP1, BP2,
PFP1, PFP2, OP1, and OP2 are 1.041, 1.079, 1.025, 1.102, 1.052, and
1.089 g/cm3, respectively.

These density values are
subsequently used to produce more than 50 different amorphous lattices
for each molecule, each with approximately 20 molecules, with a side
length of a = 25.3056, 26.4904, 26.7794, 25.9933,
25.9812, and 26.1645 Å for BP1, BP2, PFP1, PFP2, OP1, and OP2,
respectively. The previous calculation steps are then repeated, and
the energy is minimized.

At room temperature, the hopping model
is used to describe the charge transfer of OSCs.14,23,24 According to the theory of the hopping model,
the mobility of amorphous organic solids depends critically on two
parameters:25 reorganization energy λ
and charge-transfer integral V. The essence of the
transfer integral V is the overlapping of the electron
cloud of two molecules, which is highly impacted by the relative spatial
location of the solids.26 The charge-transfer
rate W can be described by the Marcus equation 1  where V is the electron coupling matrix element between adjacent molecules,
that is, the transfer integral, reflecting the intensity of the electron
interaction (VDA means the transfer integral
between donor and acceptor. In this report, it means the two adjacent
molecules, and denoted with V); T is the temperature; KB and h are the Boltzmann constant and the Planck constant, respectively;
Among them, V and λ are two decisive factors
affecting the speed of charge transfer.

Reorganization energy
is usually divided into internal reorganization energy and external
reorganization energy. The internal reorganization energy is essentially
the relaxation energy of the charged molecular state to the neutral
configuration, which is related to the change of the molecule structure.
The external reorganization energy, which is often ignored when calculating
the reorganization energy of the reaction, is affected by the polarization
of the solvent molecule. Compared with the internal reorganization
energy, external reorganization taken environmental polarization effects
into account and the values are usually small, so only the internal
reorganization energy is considered only since charge transfer takes
place in the solid.27 The monomer structures
are optimized by the adiabatic potential energy surface method, which
can be expressed by the following formula 2  where E is
the neutral state energy in the neutral configuration; E* is the neutral state energy in the ion configuration; E+ is the ion state energy in the ion configuration; E+* is the ion state energy in the neutral configuration. All configuration
calculations are performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian
09 program.

Charge-transfer integral indicates the degree of
electron cloud overlap of the frontier orbits of two adjacent molecules.
The isolated orbital method is a relatively accurate method for evaluating
the transfer integral. The core of the method is that in the case
of single-electron approximation, the migration of charges between
molecules mainly occurs between the frontier orbitals of adjacent
molecules. The electron-transfer integral between two orbitals can
be approximated by direct coupling. The electrons run in the LUMO
orbital of adjacent molecules, and the holes are the migration among
HOMO orbitals. φa, φb refer to the frontier orbital of molecules a and b, respectively; Hab is the one-electron Hamiltonian operator
of dimers, which can be calculated by this method of the isolated
orbit. The frontier orbital coupling strength of adjacent molecules
is directly calculated. When considering the nonorthogonality of isolated
molecular orbitals, that is, the spatial overlap integral of isolated
orbits ⟨φa|φb⟩ = Sab ≠ 0, it is necessary to do symmetric orthogonalization
for isolated orbits, the Löwdin transformation, which gives
the so-called effective electron-transfer integral 3  The effective
electron-transfer integral V obtained by orthogonally
changing the basis function is the electronic coupling in the Marcus–Hush
semiempirical charge-transfer rate formula. The HOMO eigenvalue of
the molecule a is used as the site energy of the
isolated orbit.

where 4   5   6   7  On this basis, the Einstein equation
was applied to evaluate the carrier mobility of the material, which
can be expressed as the following equation 8  where e is the unit charge and KB is
the Boltzmann constant, T represents the thermodynamic
temperature, and D is the diffusion coefficient between
the dimers, which is the sum of the diffusion coefficients of all
transition pathways within 12 Å away from the central molecule.28 The formula is as follows 9  where n = 3 represents the spatial dimension. rab represents the length of the dimers,
whose charge is transferred from the molecule a to
molecule b; Wab represents the rate of charge hopping; and Pab is the probability of charge transfer
from the molecule a to molecule b.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Frontier Molecular Orbital
All geometric structures are optimized with the density functional
theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The results of the
molecular optimization studied are shown in Figure 3. The HOMO and LUMO energy distributions
of BP1, BP2, PFP1, PFP2, OP1, and OP2 have been listed in Table 1 and Figure 3. There are also experimental
values for comparison.

In organic semiconductors, the splitting
of the highest occupied orbital HOMO or the lowest unoccupied orbital
level LUMO leads to the transfer integration of the dimers of two
adjacent molecules, thereby describing electron or hole transport.
It can be seen from Figure 3, both the HOMO and LUMO orbitals have the π-orbital
conjugation feature and are mainly distributed on the pyrene–fluorene
main conjugated core.

PFP1 and PFP2 have higher HOMO values
than BP1, BP2 and OP1, OP2. The only difference is the C9 substitution
of the fluorene core. BP1 and BP2 are substituted by phenyl, and PFP1
and PFP2 are replaced by the nonconjugated pyrene, which is an electron-rich
group; and OP1 and OP2 are substituted by an electron-withdrawing
group oxadiazole.

3.2 Reorganization Energy
Here, the adiabatic potential energy
surface method was used to evaluate the intramolecular electron and
hole reorganization energy at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level; the simulated
reorganization energy results are shown in Table 2. According to eq 1, the carrier transition rate is inversely
related to the reorganization energy. As shown in Table 2, the calculated λe (the reorganization energy of the electron) ranges from 0.1338
to 0.2733 eV for these compounds, which are slightly larger than that
of pentacene (0.129 eV).25 The calculated
λh (the reorganization energy of hole) ranges from
0.0136 to 0.1541 eV for these compounds. The hole reorganization energies
of PFP1 and PFP2 are very close. Similarly, BP1 and BP2, OP1 and OP2
are also very close, which indicates that the increase of π-conjugation
has little effect on the reorganization energy of the holes. The hole
reorganization energy and electron reorganization energy of the three
materials PFP1, PFP2, and BP2 are close to each other, suggesting
that they probably are bipolar charge-transport materials. The reorganization
energy of PFP1 is smaller than that of BP1 and OP1, and PFP2 is also
smaller than BP2 and OP2. This indicates that the substituents at
the C9 position have a great influence on the reorganization energy.

3.3 Transfer Integral
The charge-transfer integral of amorphous materials is an important
factor in determining its charge-transport performance. The spatial
orientation of the dimers and the order of molecular packing have
a great influence on it. The main carrier-transfer pathways in the
studied molecules are listed in Figures 4, 5, and 6. Due to the disorder of amorphous molecules, the
transfer integrals among dimers composed of adjacent molecules within
12 Å of the selected central molecule were mainly calculated.
The distance to the central molecule and the detailed stacking ways
are listed in Table 3. The basis set is B3LYP/6-31G(d), and the eigenvalue of the HOMO
orbit instead of the site energy is employed. The results can also
be seen in Table 3.

a R = 2-ethylhexy; Vhole means the transfer integral of the hole
and Velectron means the transfer integral
of the
electron.

It can be seen from Table 3 that in all of the selected pathways of the studied molecules,
the dimers with large π-conjugation have larger transfer integrals.
In the intermolecular transfer pathways of the OP2, the distance of
pathway 1 is the closest and the transfer integral is the largest.
Among them, the value of the hole is 45.42 meV, the electron’s
is 13.76 meV. The pathway 3 is the farthest, and the transfer integral
is the smallest, where is 1.57 meV for the hole and 4.02 meV for the
electron. Traditionally, the transfer pathway with large π–π
stacking arrangement has a corresponding larger transfer integral.
Since the three-dimensional lattice was constructed to simulate the
actual situation of the amorphous material, the direct arrangement
of each dimer has a partial π–π stack, edge to
edge or side to side. Therefore, it is found that the center distance
of the dimer is also an important factor influencing the transfer
integral. Generally, the closer dimer distance results in the larger
transfer integral.30 Compared with OP1,
the order of molecular stacking in OP2 changed with the degree of
conjugation of the fluorene core, and the transfer integral of the
closest dimer increased. Compared with PFP1, the introduction of electron-withdrawing
oxadiazole substituents in OP1 leads to a decrease in the transport
integral of the main transport pathways. By increasing the degree
of conjugation of PFP1, the transfer integral of the main dimers of
PFP2 is unexpectedly reduced, although it is larger than that of OP2,
which should be ascribed to the molecular packing disorder.

For the same degree of conjugation of the fluorene core, the order
of the transfer integral is OP1 > BP1 > PFP1, OP2 > BP2 >
PFP2. Since oxadiazole group is smaller than the pyrenel group, which
will lead to a more tightly stack and smaller dimmer distance. Then,
OP1 and OP2 have larger orbital overlap and, thus, larger charge-transfer
integral.

3.4 Carrier
Mobility
According to the Marcus equation and the Einstein
relationship, reorganization energy and transfer integral are two
decisive factors affecting the mobility of carriers. Increasing the
transfer integral could be the main way to improve its mobility. Generally,
the smaller reorganization energy and the larger transfer integral
result in greater carrier mobility.31 By
calculating the charge-transfer rate constant W of
the main transport pathways, the diffusion coefficient D, the charge mobility values at normal temperature (T = 300 K) are listed in Table 4 and Figure 7. The average value of the hole mobility showed OP1 > BP1 >
OP2 > PFP1 > PFP2 > BP2. The average value of the electron
mobility showed OP1 > BP2 > BP1 > PFP1 > OP2 > PFP2.
Their electron mobility is close to the hole mobility, and the values
differ in one order of magnitude. Therefore, it is believed that these
materials belong to bipolar transport organic semiconductors. There
are some interesting calculated results. For example, the average
hole mobilities of OP1 and OP2 are about 4–5 times larger than
that of electrons. From BP1 to OP1, the phenyl group on C9 of fluorene
is replaced by the oxadiazole group, which is an electron-withdrawing
group and will lead to electron transport according to a common viewpoint.
But the results in this report show that the hole mobility is still
larger than the electron mobility. In contrast to this, the hole mobility
in BP2 is more than 10 times smaller than that of the electron mobility.
However, there is no electron-withdrawing group such as the oxadiazole
group in BP2, which should mean that the hole mobility should be larger
than the electron mobility in the traditional viewpoint of p-type
OSCs.

mobilities for holes and electrons in the employed materials.

In the previous research, there are few reports on the
experimental bipolar transfer on OSCs in the diode. One wonderful
report is about the bipolar transport of diaryl-substituted terfluorene
in the diode determined by the TOF method,32 in which, the bipolar transport was ascribed to the 3-dimension
structure of the diaryl groups substitution at C9 of fluorene. The
research in this report shows that the 3-dimension structure is not
necessary to the bipolar transport, even if which will lead to different
packing disorders. The more experimental bipolar reports are in OFETs.3,4,13,33 In
OFETs, there is an additional gate electrode and the corresponding
insulating layer, which will significantly influence the inner carrier
transport in OSCs. As to the most excellent work of the bipolar organic
field-effect transistor,13 the n-type effect
was achieved through the additional electrode modification. And such
interface engineering will also significantly influence the inner
transport, which should not be considered as the intrinsic carrier
transfer since the influence of external fields is complicated.

There are also some calculation reports on the bipolar transport
in single-crystal OSCs.34,35 Since most of OSCs are
amorphous, some works also research the amorphous materials. However,
the used methods for investigating the amorphous OSCs are the methods
for single crystal,17,18,36−38 which should
not be suitable since the packing pattern and transfer pathways in
the amorphous and single crystal are greatly different. The four materials
(BP1, BP2, PFP1, and PFP2) have been synthesized, and their primary
optoelectronic properties have been investigated in our previous work.10 All of the research materials in this report
have been explored through the real amorphous methods. So the intrinsic
bipolar transfer characteristics achieved in this report could be
considered to be the subsequent work in our group and could be real
characteristics of amorphous OSCs.

4 Conclusions
In traditional opinion, the incorporation
of electron-rich group will lead to the so-called p-type OSCs and
hole transporting. The electron-withdrawing group will lead to the
n-type OSCs and electron transport. The p-type or n-type concept is
originated from the doping in inorganic semiconductors. From the qualitative
physical model analysis according to the six pyrene–fluorene
derivatives (BP1, BP2, PFP1, PFP2, OP1, and OP2), at the beginning,
this report states that the concept of p-type or n-type is not complete
because there is no doping in these OSCs except that in some other
doped devices. Then, the relevant charge-transfer pathways are confirmed
between adjacent molecules of these materials by simulating the true
spatial distribution of the six materials. In further, the reorganization
energy, the charge-transfer integrals, and the mobility of these materials
are calculated. The results show that pyrene–fluorene derivative
OSCs possess intrinsic bipolar transfer characteristics. The electron-rich
group substitution does not necessarily lead to that the hole mobility
is larger than the electron mobility. And the electron-withdrawing
group incorporation also does not necessarily mean that the electron
mobility should larger than the hole mobility. The results also show
that the mobility values are significantly influenced by the intramolecular
conjugation and intermolecular packing (thus, the transfer integrals).
The different values in electron and hole mobilities in one same pyrene–fluorene
material also show that the transfer mechanisms of the hole and electron
are different. In real experimental research, the trap originated
from the chemical impurity and the interface effect is not avoidable.
So, in a reasonable deduction, the trapping mechanisms for electron
and hole carrier should also be different. At last, the organic semiconductors
possess many interesting properties, and the more different and similar
molecular structure should be synthesized and investigated through
experimental and theoretical methods to propose the theoretical system
of OSC itself.
