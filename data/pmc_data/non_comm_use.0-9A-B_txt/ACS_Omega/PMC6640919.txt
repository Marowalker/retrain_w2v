In this study, a
plasma-modified process was developed to control
the electrical properties of atomic layer deposition (ALD)-grown vanadium
dioxide (VO2), which is potentially useful for applications
such as resistive switching devices, bolometers, and plasmonic metamaterials.
By inserting a plasma pulse with varying H2 gas flow into
each ALD cycle, the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) temperature
of postdeposition-annealed crystalline VO2 films was adjusted
from 63 to 78 °C. Film analyses indicate that the tunability
may arise from changes in grain boundaries, morphology, and compositional
variation despite hydrogen not remaining in the annealed VO2 films. This growth method, which enables a systematic variation
of the electronic behavior of VO2, provides capabilities
beyond those of the conventional thermal ALD and plasma-enhanced ALD.

Introduction
Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has
the ability to reversibly
transform from an insulator at lower temperatures to a metal at higher
temperatures, with the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) occurring
at about 68 °C.1 The abrupt electrical
resistivity drop, up to 5 orders of magnitude, arises from a change
in the VO2 phase, with the low-temperature monoclinic structure
transitioning to a tetragonal rutile structure above the IMT. Furthermore,
the IMT itself can be shifted over a limited range by varying the
properties of the film, including stoichiometry, microstructure, grain
orientation, and strain.2−6 Such fundamental features make VO2 attractive for numerous
applications that require or benefit from tunable conductivity, including
resistive memories and switches,7−9 bolometers,10 plasmonic metamaterials,11 and
Mott-field transistors.12 Various growth
techniques for VO2 thin films have been reported in the
literature, including magnetron sputtering,13 liquid injection chemical vapor deposition,14 molecular beam epitaxy (MBE),15 pulsed
laser deposition (PLD),16,17 and atomic layer deposition
(ALD).13,18−20 Although some physical
vapor deposition techniques have demonstrated tuning of the electrical
properties of VO2 by varying the oxygen flow rate during
the growth or by ex situ hydrogen incorporation,15−17,21 a method to easily control the electrical properties
has not yet been well established for vanadium oxide grown by ALD,
a deposition technique that is highly desirable for applications requiring
conformal thin-film growth.

The material properties of thin
films grown by conventional thermal
ALD and plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) are generally varied by controlling
the deposition parameters, such as the growth temperature, precursor
dosing and purging conditions; postannealing conditions; and extrinsic
doping/alloying.22−25 An alternative approach is to alter the conventional ALD sequence
by incorporating additional reactive plasma/metal precursor steps
into the growth cycle, which has been shown to modify the electrical
properties of ALD-grown ZnO thin films.26

In this article, we report a plasma-modified ALD method that
incorporates
hydrogen plasma treatment steps into the growth sequence of vanadium
oxide, allowing a simple and fine variation of the electrical properties,
which is not generally achieved by conventional thermal ALD or PEALD.
Plasma steps with increasing H2 gas flow rates are shown
to increase the resistivity and the IMT temperature of ALD VO2 thin films, and film analyses suggest that these changes
may be associated with growth-induced changes in morphology and grain
structure or with stoichiometry modification arising from oxygen deficiency.

Results
and Discussion
As shown in the Raman spectra in Figure 1a, the as-deposited
vanadium oxide films
are amorphous for both plasma-treated and untreated cases, where the
strong peak at ∼520 cm–1 arises from the
Si substrate. Following the 480 °C postdeposition annealing in
N2, the films are converted to crystalline VO2 (Figure 1b), where
all non-Si peaks correspond to VO2 vibrations.27,28 The Raman spectra are consistent across both treated and untreated
films, indicating that similar, phase-pure polycrystalline VO2 films were formed regardless of the variation in the H2 flow rate, and the H2-plasma exposure did not
damage the deposited VO2.

Figure 1 Raman spectra of (a) as-deposited vanadium
oxide and (b) vanadium
oxide postannealed at 480 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. Films grown
by thermal ALD are compared to those treated with H2 plasma
at flow rates of 30, 50, and 100 sccm. Solid orange and gray vertical
lines indicate Raman modes of VO2 and Si, respectively.

In Figure 2a, electrical
resistivity (ρ) is plotted against temperature (T) for VO2 treated with different hydrogen flow rates of
30, 50, and 100 sccm in the H2/Ar gas plasma mixture and
compared with untreated VO2 grown by thermal ALD. All films
were annealed in nitrogen following deposition and are crystalline.
The derivative [d(log ρ)/dT] versus
temperature curves are plotted in Figure 2b, where the minimum and maximum values indicate
the IMT and metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) temperatures during
heating and cooling, respectively. The transition temperatures are
plotted against H2 gas flow rate in the inset of Figure 2b, where it can be
seen that the IMT temperature generally increases with increasing
hydrogen flow, while the MIT temperature is roughly constant, resulting
in an increased hysteresis at higher hydrogen flow rates. At the maximum
hydrogen flow rate used here, 100 sccm, the VO2 IMT temperature
was ∼78 °C, a 15 °C increase from the IMT temperature
of ∼63 °C observed for the thermally grown film. With
increasing hydrogen flow, the resistivities in both the insulating
and metal phases increased as well. The resistivity at high temperatures
increased by approximately 2 orders of magnitude as the hydrogen flow
rate was increased from 30 to 100 sccm, whereas the resistivity increased
by less than an order of magnitude at low temperatures (Figure 2a). This results in a smaller
insulator-to-metal resistance ratio (Ri/Rm) at higher H2 gas flow
rates, with Ri/Rm decreasing by an order of magnitude, from 3.2 × 103 at a H2 flow of 30 sccm to 3.8 × 102 at a H2 flow of 100 sccm. The as-deposited amorphous
films showed only a slight decrease in resistivity from 6.4 to 0.7
Ω cm with increasing temperature, suggesting no significant
IMT behavior.

All films were annealed in N2 at 480 °C before measurement.
The inset shows transition temperatures determined from the derivative
curves plotted as a function of H2 flow rate.

A variety of mechanisms have been shown to influence
the temperature-dependent
electrical properties of VO2 thin films, including variations
in stoichiometry, strain, oxygen defect density, and the presence
of grain boundaries.2−6,29,30 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images of the O 1s, V
2p1/2, and V 2p3/2 peaks for the treated and
untreated vanadium oxide films, which were postannealed in nitrogen,
are shown in Figure 3. A compositional analysis of vanadium oxides via XPS is challenging
because films readily oxidize in air, forming a layer of V2O5 on the surface, and Ar+ bombardment reduces
the surface due to preferential oxygen sputtering.31,32 However, it has been reported that a representative film for comparative
purposes can be obtained with careful etching using slow ions;31 therefore, samples were slowly sputtered with
Ar ions for 10 s until the C 1s peak could no longer be detected.
To estimate the compositional trends, the O 1s and V 2p regions were
fitted together using a Shirley background, and the oxygen-to-vanadium
(O/V) atomic % ratio was computed by integrating the fitted peak intensities
and scaling by appropriate sensitivity factors. As depicted in the
inset of Figure 3,
the O/V atomic % ratio appears to decrease slightly as the H2 flow rate is decreased from 100 to 30 sccm, suggesting an increase
in oxygen deficiency and a corresponding metal enrichment with decreasing
H2 gas flow for the annealed films. The correlation of
decreasing IMT temperature with increasing oxygen vacancies among
the plasma-treated annealed films is in agreement with the trends
observed in previous reports for VO2 films grown by PLD,
MBE, and sputtering.15−17 Although the as-deposited films do not show any noticeable
trend correlated with the plasma treatments, the annealed films in
overall tend to have a higher oxygen content compared to that of the
as-deposited films, which may be due to the trace amount of oxygen
in the annealing atmosphere.

Figure 3 XPS of annealed vanadium oxide films treated
with different flow
rates of hydrogen plasma and a film grown by thermal ALD. The inset
shows plot of oxygen to vanadium (O/V) atomic % ratio vs H2 flow rate comparing as-deposited (black squares) and annealed (red
circles) films.

Variations in the VO2 film morphology due to the plasma
treatment are evident in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographs
of Figure 4, where
the N2-annealed films exhibit decreasing surface roughness
with increasing H2 gas flow. The root-mean-square roughness
(σRMS) of 12.3 nm for the untreated film decreases
to 4.6 nm for the smoothest case, and is obtained with a hydrogen
flow of 100 sccm. Along with the decreasing roughness, the larger,
more anisotropic, long, thin grains of the thermally grown VO2 film gradually become smaller and more isotropic with increasing
hydrogen flow. The average grain sizes are estimated at 217 ±
116 nm for the thermally grown film and 217 ± 188, 188 ±
73, and 166 ± 61 nm for the treated films with H2 flow
rates of 30, 50, and 100 sccm, respectively. The decreasing grain
size of crystals implies more grain boundaries and thus a lower carrier
mobility, which would contribute to the overall resistivity increase
observed with a higher H2 gas flow rate.3,4,33 Previous reports suggest that the IMT transition
behavior, such as the transition sharpness, transition amplitude,
and hysteresis width, can be strongly influenced by the density and
orientation of grain boundaries.34−36 A decrease in the grain
boundary density can release internal stress, leading to a higher
transition amplitude and a smaller hysteresis width.37 However, Raman peak positions between the plasma-treated
annealed films shift by less than 1 cm–1 (Figure 1), suggesting that
any stress differences in the films are too small to make much difference
in the IMT behavior. A tendency of a sharper transition, a higher
transition amplitude, and a smaller hysteresis width (Figure 2) is observed with increasing
grain size, which agrees well with some previous reports.34−36 However, there is a
much larger change in the hysteresis width and a smaller change in
the grain size compared to those of these reports, suggesting that
although grain size may play some role in influencing the IMT, it
cannot be the only reason and the observed change must be due to a
combination of morphological and chemical effects.

flow rates of hydrogen plasma and a film grown by thermal ALD.

Plasma–surface interactions
are varied and complex, making
it difficult to precisely identify the chemical and physical mechanisms
at work in the plasma-modified ALD process. The distribution of radical
and excited species, mean ion energy, and electron energy distribution
within the plasma depend greatly on the gas composition and pressure,
even for the same nominal applied RF power. The concentration of reactive
atomic hydrogen species in a plasma has been shown to vary with gas
composition in a complex way such that a higher H2 flow
sometimes actually yields lower amounts of energetic atomic H.38 In addition to providing reactive species, the
plasma may deliver localized surface heating through the exothermic
recombination of atomic radicals as well as the physical impact of
other energetic species (i.e., electronically excited states, low-energy
ions, and fast neutrals).39 During the
H2-plasma pulse of the modified ALD process, the impingement
of reactive and/or energetic species may alter the distribution of
adsorbates and dangling bonds on the growth surface, possibly favoring
the more thermodynamically favorable energy facets of crystals or
modifying the number and types of sites available for reaction in
the following ALD step (the second TEMAV pulse before reaction with
water). The modification of the growth surface in this way could lead
to changes in the incorporation of precursor that would impact the
stoichiometry and morphology of the resulting film. Regardless of
the mechanism, it is noteworthy that the effects due to the ALD hydrogen
plasma treatment persist even after high-temperature anneals, which
suggests it to be a robust means for controlling film properties.

Finally, as the variation in composition and morphology could account
for the trends in the electronic behavior of VO2 films
that we observe, one may ask whether there is a possible incorporation
of hydroxyl groups or hydrogen doping as contributing factors due
to the H2 plasma step. However, it is important to note
that all samples, including those grown with additional H2 plasma steps, were annealed in nitrogen at 480 °C following
growth to induce crystallization. As it has been previously shown
that water and hydrogen desorb at 420 °C in similar metal oxides40 and dehydrogenation in VO2 occurs
at 320 °C,41 there should be a negligible
hydrogen content in the annealed crystalline VO2 films,
suggesting that hydrogen doping is not responsible for the electronic
behavior observed.

Conclusions
In summary, a plasma-modified
deposition method was developed to
tune the electrical properties of ALD-grown and postannealed crystalline
VO2 films. By inserting a plasma pulse with varying H2 gas flow rates between two TEMAV pulses during the ALD growth
cycle, the temperature-dependent electrical properties of VO2 could be varied, with the IMT temperature increasing, the resistance
ratio of insulator-to-metal phases decreasing, and the metal and insulator
phase resistances increasing with increasing hydrogen flow rate. The
variation in the electrical properties is suggested to arise from
a combination of stoichiometric, morphological, and chemical effects
introduced by the modified growth sequence. The plasma-modified ALD
using hydrogen plasma exposure extends the versatility of ALD for
vanadium oxide deposition and represents a method for tuning the film
properties that are not currently accessible by conventional VO2 ALD.

Experimental Section
Vanadium oxide
films with thickness of approximately 40–60
nm were grown at 150 °C on Si(100) and quartz substrates in a
commercial Beneq TFS-200 PEALD system. The precursors used were tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)vanadium(IV)
(TEMAV, V(NEtMe)4, Air Liquide) and deionized H2O for the vanadium and oxygen sources, respectively, with ultrahigh-purity
argon used as the carrier gas. The vanadium precursor was evaporated
at 60 °C from an open boat inside a hot cell (Beneq 500 cell)
attached to the chamber. The exposure times for each dose of TEMAV
and H2O were 2 and 0.2 s, respectively. For the hydrogen-plasma-treated
samples, the H2 plasma was dosed during the deposition
using the following ALD sequence: TEMAV/H2 plasma/TEMAV/H2O. The H2 plasma exposure step consisted of a 3
s pulse of 13.56 MHz, 100 W RF power, in a closely spaced, capacitively
coupled geometry, with the H2 gas flow, introduced from
the plasma shower head, set variably to 30, 50, or 100 sccm. The Ar
flow rate through the shower head was held constant at 400 sccm for
all plasma runs. A grid installed between the plasma and the substrate
intercepts most ions, ensuring primarily neutral species to reach
the sample. For comparison, an untreated film was deposited by thermal
ALD using the conventional ALD sequence of TEMAV/H2O. Films
grown by the conventional thermal ALD sequence and the four-step plasma
sequence all have similar growth rates of ∼0.2 Å/cyc.
Vanadium oxide films grown by ALD are generally reported to be amorphous
in the as-deposited state, with no significant IMT behavior, and therefore
require annealing to be converted to crystalline VO2.18−20 Previous studies have reported that postannealing in N2 or a N2/O2 gas mixture with a low O2 partial pressure resulted in crystalline monoclinic VO2 for the temperature range of 450–500 °C.19,20 As a result, following deposition, all of the samples in this study
were annealed at 480 °C for 1 h in a hot-wall chamber connected
to a roughing pump under a constant flow of ∼8 Torr of 99.5%
N2 gas. Determined by calculations based on the total gas
pressure and the gas purity, the O2 background pressure
is ∼0.008 Torr.

Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements
on deposited films
were made using a four-point probe system with a heated sample holder.
The film thickness for each sample was verified by spectral ellipsometry.
The film crystallinity was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, using a
100 μW 488 nm laser, and the film composition was examined by
XPS (Thermo Scientific, K-Alpha with an Al Kα source), and the
surface morphology was investigated by tapping-mode AFM (Bruker).
