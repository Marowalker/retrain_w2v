Introduction
Domino one-pot strategies
have become crucial for the construction
of multiple bonds in a single reaction vessel. Friedel–Crafts
reaction has been long known as one of the classical methods for the
construction of C–C bonds.1 This
reaction is popular for the synthesis of alkyl arenes and aryl ketones
through Friedel–Crafts alkylation and Friedel–Crafts
acylation, respectively. Over the time, a broad range of Lewis and
Brønsted acids in stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric amounts
have been employed toward aromatic electrophilic substitutions.2−5 In particular, the Friedel–Crafts acylation, is an indispensible
method for the synthesis of feedstock chemicals, useful synthons,
and fine chemicals.6 Of late, this facile
method has been manipulated using novel precursors to afford varied
annulated carbocyclic products. Among them, the fused tricyclic compounds7 and the spirocyclic compounds8 have been of great interest.

The fused tricyclic
core is present as an integral part in a wide
variety of naturally occurring compounds. For example, diterpenoid
salviaprione,9 diterpene alkaloid ileabethoxazole,10 and sesteterpenoid neomangicol C(11) constitute a very distinctive fused
tricyclic core part and are reported to show significant biological
properties against bacillary dysentery, diarrhea, abdominal pain,
influenza, and antibacterial properties. The research on Incarvillea delavayiby Zhang and his associates led
to the isolation of incarviatone A, with a structurally
unique natural product hybrid with a fused tricyclic core.12 The fused tricyclic moiety also forms the part
structure in some secondary metabolites such as hypoxylonol B,13 daldinone A,14 and hypoxylonol C(15) that exhibit cytotoxic activities and antiangiogenic activity
against endothelial cells (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Representative examples of natural products comprising
the fused
tricyclic core part.

Owing to the significance of such scaffolds, numerous reports
are
described that utilized various transition metals as well as acid
catalysis for the synthesis. Some interesting routes on the synthesis
of tricyclic fused systems include cyclization of dienes, diynes,
and enynes involving the transition metal catalysis.16 Although acid-mediated approaches for various annulations
are abundant,17 in particular, pathways
for the synthesis of tricyclic fused systems are scarcely explored.18 In this context, highly efficient synthetic
routes to obtain diverse tricyclic fused carbocycles from readily
available starting materials are still in great demand.

Thus,
owing to the omnipresence of the fused and spirocyclic compounds
in the nature, we were inspired to develop a facile route toward the
synthesis of fused tricyclic and spirocyclic compounds. In continuation
to our interest on the development of domino one-pot processes,19 particularly, using acid-mediated annulations,20 recently, a practical strategy for novel spiro-tetracyclic
compounds has been accomplished.19a Herein,
we present an efficient chemoselective domino cyclization strategy
for the synthesis of novel fused tricyclic ketones. This process effectively
involves the formation of dual C–C bond via Friedel–Crafts
alkylation and Friedel–Crafts acylation sequence. Notably,
readily accessible and inert substituted cinnamic acid esters have
been employed for this domino strategy in the presence of Brønsted
acid. Significantly, these fused tricyclic ketones constitute a major
structural core of natural products of biological relevance.

Result and
Discussion
We supposed that the electronic and steric effects
of substituents
on either aromatic rings of the cinnamic acid esters 4 would play a crucial role on the chemoselective outcome of the products.
Thus, it was envisioned that the reaction of 4 in the
presence of a strong acid would initially proceed via an intramolecular
Friedel–Crafts alkylation to generate the bicyclic tetrahydronaphthalene
intermediate 7. It was contemplated that the formation
of fused [5,6,6] tricyclic ketone 5 could be feasible,
via a chemoselective intramolecular acylation from the intermediate 7, if the aromatic ring of alkyl tether is relatively more
electron rich than the β-aromatic ring of 4 (Scheme 1). Conversely, the
reaction would also afford the spiro-tetracyclic ketone 6 from the same bicyclic intermediate 7, if the β-aromatic
ring is electron richer than the alkyl-tethered aromatic ring of 4 because the spirocyclic ketone 6 would be relatively
more thermodynamically stable than the rigid fused [5,6,6] tricyclic
ketones 5. The required cinnamic acid esters 4 can be prepared using Heck coupling and Wittig–Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
protocol.

Scheme 1 Proposed Strategic Analysis for Chemoselective Synthesis
of Novel
Fused and Spirocyclic Compounds
The synthesis of precursors, cinnamic acid ester derivatives 4 has been initiated from benzaldehydes. Thus, the reaction
of benzaldehydes with allylzinc bromide, under sonochemically accelerated
conditions, furnished the corresponding homoallylic alcohols 2, in near quantitative yields. The Heck coupling of homo-allylic
alcohols 2 with iodoarenes 1 gave ketones 3. Finally, the alkyl-tethered β-aryl-α,β-unsaturated
esters 4 were accomplished from 3, using
standard Wittig–Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons conditions
(Scheme 2). It is worth
noting that the cinnamic acid esters 4 were isolated
as an inseparable mixture of geometrical (E + Z) isomers.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Strategy for the Formation of
Esters 4 from
the Corresponding Iodoarenes 1 and Homoallylic Alcohols 2 as Precursors
To initiate the study for the feasibility of final intramolecular
domino cyclization, we explored the reaction on the ester 4ca with different acids. To begin with, the ester 4ca was
treated with stoichiometric amounts of the Lewis acids. During these
trials, FeCl3 in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solvent under
heating conditions was found to yield the required fused tricyclic
product 5ca in very poor yield (Table 1; entry 1), whereas ZnCl2 and
AlCl3 did not furnish the desired product 5ca and inconclusive multiple spots were seen on TLC (Table 1; entries 2 & 3). We realized
the requirement for a much stronger acid and thus opted sulfuric acid
for the task. The reaction was not progressive under ambient conditions
(Table 1; entry 4),
and in-spite of refluxing the reaction mixture, very minimum conversion
to the product 5ca was observed on TLC (Table 1; entry 5). However, the reaction
with p-TSA also failed to show any progress in the
reaction (Table 1;
entry 6), whereas methanesulphonic acid gave product 5ca, albeit in low yield (Table 1; entry 7). As we have worked extensively on Brønsted
acid-mediated conversions, we checked the feasibility of the reaction
with superacid triflic acid. Although under ambient conditions, no
progress was noted (Table 1; entry 8), but delightfully, when refluxed, it led to product 5ca, in moderate yield (Table 1; entry 9). Further increase in the triflic acid equivalence
led to slight increase in the yield of product 5ca accompanied
with the formation of many other undesirable spots (Table 1; entry 10). In a view to obtain
a cleaner conversion and improve the yield, the reaction with triflic
acid was performed under slightly reduced temperature (50 °C).
Gratifyingly, the fused tricyclic ketone product 5ca was
obtained in very good yield (Table 1; entry 11). When chloroform was used as a solvent,
even under prolonged reaction time, the yield of product 5ca was poor (Table 1; entry 12).

By employing
these optimized conditions (Table 1, entry 11), we proceeded toward the study
of the scope and applicability of the methodology and explored the
strategy on various substituted iodoarenes 1 and on a
variety of homoallylic alcohols 2. It is worth to mention
that in all the substrates, purposefully, it was ensured that the
alkyl tethered aromatic ring is relatively more electron richer than
β-aryl moiety of the cinnamic acid esters 4ca–4ch. Thus, only this aromatic ring would chemoselectively compete in
both cyclizations to give the desired fused tricyclic ketones 5. To our delight, the scope of the methodology was observed
to be wide and delivered the expected products 5ca–5ch, in moderate to excellent yields (Table 2). Significantly, the method was amenable
to the esters bearing simple to highly electron-rich aromatic rings
of alkyl tether. The method was also studied on the variedly substituted
β-aryl moiety of cinnamic acid esters. For example, even suitable
with electron-deactivating groups like F, Cl, and Br substituents
on the aromatic ring of the β-aryl moiety (Table 2; 5af–5ch). Notably, the product 5ch with Br substituent is interesting,
as it could extend the strategy for the synthesis of various coupled
products, under transition metal catalysis. Upon close observation,
the formation of tricyclic ketone 5cd from the ester 4cd seems unusual. However, this can be explained from the
fact that the aromatic ring of the bicyclic naphthalene intermediate
is slightly electron rich than the β-para-tolyl group. Moreover,
the methyl group of bicyclic intermediate is suitably situated at
the orthoposition to the incoming acyl group, which favors the fused
tricyclic ketone 5cd. However, in the case of β-para-tolyl
moiety, the methyl group is at the metaposition to the incoming acyl
functionality that disfavors this cyclization. Significantly, all
the tricyclic ketone products possess a dense substitution pattern
on the aromatic ring of fused tricyclic systems (i.e. 1, 2, 3 or 1,
2, 3, 4 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 substitution pattern). This is very unusual
to notice, as the steric thwart due to 1, 2, 3 ... substitutions is
overcome, and this is probably due to the key role played by the electronic
factors of the aromatic substituents. It is worth noting that in our
previous results, the formation of tricyclic ketones were restricted
because of severe conformational strain in fused [5,5,6] tricyclic
system, rather selectively afforded the less strained spiro-tetracyclic
ketones.19a However, the present strategy
is based on the one carbon homologated alkyl-tethered cinnamic acid
esters, in which it has become possible to achieve fused [5,6,6] tricyclic
ketones. However, the formation of less strained spiro-tetracylic
has been suppressed by taking into considerations the electronic effects
of aromatic substituents.

a All reactions were

c Reaction

In addition to the spectroscopic evidence for structural elucidation,
the structure of the fused system 5dg was further confirmed
by the single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Table 2).

As we contemplated
that the spiro-tetracyclic compounds could also
be obtained, in the case when the β-aryl moiety is relatively
more electron rich than the other arene, surprisingly, we observed
the formation of spiro-tetracyclic ketone 6aa when both
aromatic rings are the same (i.e. phenyl). This may be due to the
fact that both aromatic rings are not much different electronically
even after achieving the bicyclic tetrahydronaphthalene intermediate 7aa via initial Friedel–Crafts alkylation by alkyl
tethered arene. Hence, in this case, thermodynamics would have been
dominated to prefer the formation of thermodynamically stable spiro-tetracyclic
ketone 6aa (Table 3). As anticipated, the reaction of the cinnamic acid ester 4ad with relatively more electron-rich β-para-tolyl
group furnished the spiro-tetracyclic ketone 6ad (Table 3). On the other hand,
the ester 4cb containing more electron-rich alkyl-tethered
anisyl group preferred the spirocyclic ketone 6cb (Table 3). At first glance,
it looks like an exception, as the electron-rich alkyl-tethered arene
must produce the fused tricyclic compound 5cb. However,
the formation of spiro-tetracyclic ketone 6cb seems reasonable,
as the anticipated fused tricyclic ketone 5cb would suffer
from steric thwart due to the ortho-methyl group of β-aryl moiety
of ester 4cb. This ortho-methyl steric effect might be
compromised in the corresponding spirocompound, as the methyl group
stays away from the cyclohexene residue, in which indanone bicyclic
part lies in the right angle plane to that of the tetrahydronaphthalene
portion.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have presented a chemoselective
domino dual C–C
bond formation for the synthesis of novel fused tricyclic ketones.
The strategy proceeds through the intramolecular Friedel–Crafts
alkylation and acylation sequence. These tricyclic motifs constitute
the major structural core of naturally occurring compounds.

Experimental
Section
IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 37 (FTIR)
spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance 400 (400 MHz)
spectrometer at 295 K in CDCl3; chemical shifts (δ
ppm) and coupling constants (Hz) are reported in a standard fashion
with reference to either internal standard tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.00 ppm) or CHCl3 (δH = 7.25
ppm). 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance
400 (100 MHz) spectrometer at room temperature in CDCl3; chemical shifts (δ ppm) are reported relative to CHCl3 [δC = 77.00 ppm (central line of triplet)].
In the 13C NMR, the nature of carbons (C, CH, CH2, and CH3) was determined by recording the DEPT-135 spectra
and is given in parentheses and noted as s = singlet (for C), d =
doublet (for CH), t = triplet (for CH2), and q = quartet
(for CH3). In the 1H NMR, the following abbreviations
were used throughout: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet,
qui = quintet, sept = septet, dd = doublet of doublet, m = multiplet,
and br. s = broad singlet. The assignment of signals was confirmed
by 1H, 13C CPD, and DEPT spectra. High-resolution
mass spectra (HR-MS) were recorded on an Agilent 6538 UHD Q-TOF electron
spray ionization (ESI) mode and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
modes. All small-scale dry reactions were carried out using Schlenk
tubes under an inert atmosphere. Reactions were monitored by TLC on
a silica gel using a combination of hexane and ethyl acetate as eluents.
Reactions were generally run under argon or a nitrogen atmosphere.
Solvents were distilled prior to use; petroleum ether with a boiling
range of 60 to 80 °C was used. TfOH was purchased from local
sources and used as received. Acme’s silica gel (60–120
mesh) was used for column chromatography (approximately 20 g per 1
g of crude material).

GP-1 (General Procedure for
the Synthesis of Fused
Tricyclic 5 and Spiro Tetracyclic Systems 6)
In an oven-dried Schlenk tube were added ester 4 (147–184 mg, 0.5 mmol) and DCE (2.0 mL) followed by TfOH
(0.13 mL, 1.5 mmol) at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere
and allowed the reaction mixture to stir at 50 °C for 12–24
h. The progress of the fused system 5/spiro system 6 formation was monitored by TLC till the reaction is completed.
Then, the mixture was quenched by the addition of aqueous NaHCO3 solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 ×
20 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated NaCl solution,
dried (Na2SO4), and filtered. Evaporation of
the solvent under reduced pressure and purification of the crude material
by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate)
furnished the fused tricyclic system 5/spiro tetracyclic
system 6 (53–91%) as viscous oil/semisolid/solid.
