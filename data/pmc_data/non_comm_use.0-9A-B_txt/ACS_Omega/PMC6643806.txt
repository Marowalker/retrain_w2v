A recent study on magnetically induced
currents in 10-isocorrole derivatives indicated that both the free-base
and metal-complexed forms of the unsubstituted macrocycle are homoaromatic.
Furthermore, depending on the substituents at the 10-position, the
aromatic character was found to swing between substantially homoaromatic
to substantially antihomoaromatic. Heteroisocorroles, in which the
saturated 10-position has been replaced by a heteroatom-containing
group X, are predicted to exhibit even more dramatic variations in
aromatic character, ranging from strongly aromatic (X = O, NH, PH,
and S) to strongly antiaromatic (X = BH and CO). Interestingly, the
experimentally studied X = SiMe2 case does not appear to
sustain a significant global ring current.

Introduction
Isocorroles are a class of hybrid ligands that combine the diprotic
character of porphyrins and the contracted N4 cavity of
corroles.1−4 Heteroisocorroles (a term that we prefer over heterocorroles),
in which the saturated meso carbon of isocorroles is substituted by
a heteroatom, vastly expand the scope of these ligands.5,6 Like other sterically constrained porphyrinoids, such as porphyrazines7 and corroles,8 10-heteroisocorroles
have been shown to stabilize unusual transition metal spin states,
such as intermediate-spin Fe(III),9,10 whereas strong
absorption in the red and near-infrared
(IR) range may result in applications as near-IR dyes and in photodynamic
therapy.11 Additionally, Bröring
and co-workers have noted fascinating variations of aromatic character
among 10-heteroisocorrole derivatives, characterizing the observations
as “a welcome subject for future in-depth theoretical studies”.5
On a related note, recent density functional theory
(DFT) calculations of magnetically induced current densities have
shown that the parent isocorrole is homoaromatic (i.e., aromatic in
spite of a formally interrupted conjugation) and the aromatic character
is susceptible to dramatic substituent effects.12 Herein, we have extended analogous B3LYP13−15/def2-TZVP16 current
density analyses17−22 to free-base and Ni(II)-complexed heteroisocorroles
(Figure 1) (see Methods). In terms of their current density distribution,
the compounds have been found to be tremendously diverse, ranging
from strongly aromatic to strongly antiaromatic, somewhat reminiscent
of the variations in the aromatic character of the homotropylium cation
as a function of out-of-plane deformation.23,24 Consistent
with predictions by Breslow,25 who
incidentally coined the term ‘antiaromatic’,26 antiaromatic porphyrinoids have recently found
application as components of highly conducting molecular circuits.27 A host of other fascinating spectroscopic signatures
has also been attributed to antiaromatic porphyrinoids.28 The identification of new antiaromatic heteroisocorroles,
therefore, in our view, is a particularly intriguing aspect of the
present study.

Results and Discussion
The unsubstituted isocorroles H2[10-IsoCor] and Ni[10-IsoCor]
sustain moderate diatropic currents of 5.6–9.8 nA/T along the
Cα–Cmeso bonds and the direct pyrrole–pyrrole
bond (Figure 2). Substituting
the 10-CH2 group with divalent groups with a π lone
pair (i.e., X = NH,5,29−31 O,5,32,33 PH, and S5,33−35) dramatically boosts the global diatropic ring current,
clearly signifying global aromaticity. The results presented in Figure 3 allow for several
interesting observations.

and Ni[10-IsoCor]. Note: Throughout this paper, the current density
has been plotted 1 b above the mean molecular plane, and the colors
blue (0.001 au) to red (0.000 au) represent strong to weak current
densities.

plots for
aromatic heteroisocorrole derivatives.

To a first approximation, the current
density plots for all the aromatic systems are topologically similar
in that the great majority of the diatropic current flows along the
outer rim of the molecules, with only a smaller amount flowing through
the inner Cα–N bonds.36 That said, a couple of significant variations among the different
compounds are pointed out. First, nickel complexation results in a
modest increase in both the global diatropic current (as measured
by that along the Cα–Cmeso bonds)
and in the current along the inner 15-membered ring, that is, the
Cα–N bonds. Second, the current along the
Cα–X bonds varies significantly across X =
NH, O, PH, and S. Indeed, the global diatropic current exhibits a
rough inverse correlation with the electronegativity of X. Presumably,
the high electronegativity of oxygen limits its ability to engage
in mesomeric electron donation relative to the other X groups. That
said, even for the oxaisocorrole derivatives (Figure 3), the global diatropic current is still
considerable, about 30% higher than that calculated for benzene at
the present level of theory (12.2 nA/T).37 Gratifyingly, these theoretical findings are fully consistent with
the experimental ones of Bröring and co-workers, who estimated
global aromaticity on the basis of the chemical shifts of meso CH
and central NH hydrogens.5

In contrast
to the above molecules, the experimentally unprecedented 10-boraisocorrole
derivatives H2[10-B-IsoCor] and Ni[10-B-IsoCor] (Figure 4) exhibit a high
paratropic global current, clearly indicating an antiaromatic macrocycle.
For H2[10-B-IsoCor], the Cα–C/Xmeso current intensity is approximately −25 nA/T, whereas
for the corresponding nickel complex the analogous current intensity
is some 50% higher, presumably reflecting higher π-electron
mobility because of the increased anionic character of the nitrogens
in the metal complex. Importantly, the global current in both of these
molecules largely flows along the inner 15-membered C11N4 ring of the macrocycle, a feature that is also shared
by other antiaromatic porphyrinoids.38 That
said, the
overall current passes almost exclusively through the inner C11N4 ring for the free base, roughly a quarter of
the global current along the outer rim for the Ni complex.

currents (nA/T)
and current density plots for antiaromatic heteroisocorrole derivatives.

Fascinatingly,
the present calculations clearly implicate the experimentally known
‘oxocorrole’39 ring system
as antiaromatic according to the magnetic criterion (Figure 4). Thus, H2[10-CO-IsoCor]
sustains a global paratropic current of roughly −10 nA/T, whereas
Ni[10-CO-IsoCor] sustains an even stronger current. A couple of minor
twists are worth pointing out. Thus, whereas all four pyrrole rings
in Ni[10-CO-IsoCor] sustain a paratropic current, the two pyrrole
rings adjoining the carbonyl group in H2[10-CO-IsoCor]
sustain local diatropic currents. The Ni complex also exhibits a marked
asymmetry between the C9/11–C10 bonds
and C1–C19 bond, with a much higher current
along the latter.

The finding that both 10-boraisocorrole and
oxocorrole behave similarly with respect to their antiaromatic character
is, of course, not a great surprise. Like a trivalent boron atom,
the carbonyl group in oxocorrole may be thought to formally remove
two electrons from the corrole π-system, resulting in magnetic
antiaromaticity. Indeed, both ring systems may be thought to be isoelectronic
to norcorrole,40,41 the smallest fully conjugated
tetrapyrrole, which has been demonstrated to be antiaromatic.

Finally, the current density profiles of the two silaisocorrole42 derivatives H2[10-Si-IsoCor] and
Ni[10-Si-IsoCor] (X = SiMe2, Figure 5) do not exhibit a significant global current,
either diatropic or paratropic. On the other hand, the pyrrole rings
exhibit strong, local diatropic currents.

Conclusions
In summary, DFT calculations have uncovered
remarkable magnetic diversity among heteroisocorrole derivatives.
Thus, aza-, phospha-, and thiaisocorroles have been found to be strongly
aromatic, and oxacorrole is somewhat less, which is nicely consistent
with the experimental literature.5 Boraisocorrole
and oxocorrole, on the other hand, have been found to be strongly
antiaromatic, whereas silaisocorrole has been found to be nonaromatic,
with respect to a global ring current. Whether heteroisocorrole
derivatives exhibit novel photophysical properties and applications remains
an exciting question for the future.

Methods
All structures were fully optimized at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP
computational level using Gaussian 09 rev. D143 and confirmed as local minima by means of frequency analyses. Magnetically
induced currents and current density plots were computed by post-analysis
of the electron density obtained from GIAO NMR computations using
the AIMAll22 suite of programs (version
17.01.25). The current magnitudes were obtained within the context
of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules developed by Keith and
Bader17−21 in terms of the integral
of the current density passing through the zero-flux surface between
two neighboring atoms. The current intensities and plots were all
obtained for a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the mean plane
of the molecules.
