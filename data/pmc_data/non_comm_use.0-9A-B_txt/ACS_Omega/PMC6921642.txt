A novel macrocyclic construct consisting of a pyrazolopyrimidine
scaffold concatenated to a benzene ring through two triazoles has
been developed to investigate uncharted chemical space with bioactive
potential. The 18-atom macrocycle was assembled via a double copper-catalyzed
alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction between 1,3-bis(azidomethyl)benzene
and a bis-propargylated pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine
core. The resulting macrocycle was functionalized further into a multicyclic
analog that displays selective inhibitory activity against the receptor
tyrosine kinase AXL.

Introduction
Molecules featuring a ring of 12 or more
atoms are formally known
as macrocycles. Enabled by their unique structural characteristics,
different macrocyclic compounds, originating from natural sources,
semisynthesis, or purely synthetic methods, have been shown to display
remarkable medicinal properties.1−3 For instance, due to the restriction
of their conformational freedom, certain macrocyclic structures possess
an enhanced binding selectivity to specific biological targets.4 Rapamycin and its derivatives, so-called rapalogs,
represent a classical example of highly selective macrocyclic inhibitors.
They have the capacity to selectively bind and block the kinase activity
of the multiprotein complex mTORC1 without affecting the parented
mTORC2.5 Additionally, macrocyclization
has become an essential method to reduce polarity and enhance the
proteolytic stability of biologically active peptides.1 Attracted by these benefits, medicinal chemists have recently
incorporated the design of macrocyclic rings from nitrogen-rich heterocyclic
cores into their toolbox of lead optimization approaches.1−4,6,7 As
a result, several macrocyclization strategies reported in the literature
have resulted in potent and selective kinase inhibitors,8−11 including the recently approved antineoplastic drug lorlatinib.12

Encouraged by the bioactive properties
of the pyrazolopyrimidine
derivative eSM119,13 a compound
that displays inhibitory activity against three oncogenic receptor
tyrosine kinases (AXL, FLT3, and RET, with IC50 values
of 0.40, 0.53, and 0.60 μM, respectively), the development of
an 18-atom macrocyclic derivative of this compound was investigated
(see Figure 1).

synthesis/retrosynthetic strategy of eSM119 (left) and
macrocycle 1 (right). The novel compound 1 was designed by the incorporation of a second triazole group
to enclose the cyclophene ring.

Results and Discussion
A nonsymmetrical dimer-macrocyclization
strategy based on a double-copper(I)-catalyzed
alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction was applied for
the construction of macrocycle 1 from commercially available
6-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, 2. The full synthetic route is described in Scheme 1 and the Experimental
Section. Briefly, iodination at the C3 position was carried
out with N-iodosuccinimide (76%), followed by alkylation
with propargyl bromide (46%) to incorporate the first alkyne group.
Subsequently, the chloro atom at the C6 position of 4 was substituted via a SNAr reaction14 with propargylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to introduce
a second alkyne handle on the pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine
core, giving rise to compound 5 in good yield (80%).
The assembly of dialkyne 5 with 1,3-bis(azidomethyl)benzene 6 was achieved using copper iodide, sodium ascorbate, and
triethylamine15 to give rise to macrocycle 7 in 23% yield. Since the modest reaction yield obtained was
sufficient to progress to the next step of the route, reaction conditions
were not optimized further. The synthesis of the macrocyclic analogue
of eSM119, that is, compound 1, was completed
by the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of 7 with 6-(4-Boc-piperazinyl)pyridyl-3-boronic
acid pinacol ester, 8, followed by Boc deprotection under
acidic conditions (51% yield for two steps).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the
18-Atom Macrocycle 1 from 6-Chloro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, 2
NMR studies of compounds 7, 9, and 1 provided insights into the conformational
dynamics of this
novel macrocyclic construct. An extremely broad doublet was observed
from 4 to 5.2 ppm in the spectra of the three compounds (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, highlighted
by a frame). This flat-looking signal, which was identified as the
methylene group bonded to the amino group at the C6 position, is indicative
of numerous conformers coexisting at the ambient temperature.16 These conformers can present the methylene protons
oriented toward slightly different chemical surroundings, thus inducing
different shieldings and consequently different chemical shifts. The
presence of multiple conformers is in agreement with in silico calculations
obtained with MacroModel,17 which yielded
155 conformers that can be classified into four main groups (see Figure 2 and Supporting. Information).

(3D) structure models (superimposed
through the pyrazolopyrimidine ring) of four of the most significant
types of conformers found for 1 after macrocyclic sampling
with MacroModel.

Next, 1H NMR analysis of 1 was performed
over a range of temperatures (27, 40, 60, and 80 °C), aiming
to overcome the rotational energy barrier and increase the rate of
exchange between the conformers. As shown in Figure 3A, the NMR spectra show the coalescence of
the signals as the temperature increases, eventually merging into
a single averaged peak at 4.64 ppm that integrates for two protons.
Given the moderate temperature required for conformer interconversions
(single peak starts to form at 40 °C), it is expected that under
physiological conditions, compound 1 could exchange between
conformers to potentially find energetically favorable conformations
that increase cell permeability and/or binding to target proteins
in an effective manner.

(B, C) two-dimensional (2D) HSQC analysis of 1 at 27
and 80 °C.

The methylene peak annotation was corroborated
by a 2D heteronuclear
single-quantum correlation (HSQC) analysis (Figure 3B,C). Although no carbon–proton coupling
was seen at 27 °C, a strong correlation between the carbon peak
at 36.7 ppm of the 13C NMR spectrum and the proton signal
at 4.64 ppm was clearly observed when the experiment was performed
at 80 °C.

Given the structural and conformational differences
between macrocycle 1 and its open analogue eSM119 (see Figure 1), the
biological
properties of 1 were expected to differ from those of eSM119. To evaluate this, biochemical assays were performed
to test the capacity of 1 to inhibit the enzymatic activity
of a selection of closely related protein kinases: TAM family members
TYRO3, AXL, and MER and receptor tyrosine kinases RET and FLT3. This
focused panel of kinases was selected based on the reported selectivity
profile of eSM119.13 Enzymatic
studies (based on 33P incorporation) were performed by
Reaction Biology Corp. using a 10-point semi-log dilution series.18 The calculated IC50 values are compiled
in Table 1.

a Member of the TAM subfamily.

The study revealed that compound 1 moderately
inhibits
AXL kinase with an IC50 value of 13 μM. Notably,
it did not elicit the inhibition of TYRO3, MER, and RET (estimated
IC50 > 1 mM) and exhibited an IC50 value
of
53.5 μM for FLT3, a potency over 4-fold lower than that against
AXL. The inhibitory properties of macrocycle 1 clearly
contrast with the similar levels of activity displayed by eSM119 for AXL and kinases FLT3 and RET (1.3- and 1.5-fold differences,
respectively). Thus, the large difference in activity displayed by
macrocycle 1 against AXL and RET, with IC50 values differing by >75-fold, is particularly relevant. The improved
selectivity profile of 1 is important because, despite
many efforts, the development of selective AXL inhibitors has proved
to be extremely challenging, with no selective inhibitors of AXL kinase
activity reported to date.19 This includes
bemcentinib, an orally available kinase inhibitor in clinical development
that is marketed as an AXL-selective inhibitor,19 although it has been shown by several groups to equally
inhibit FLT3 and other kinases.13,20,21 To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 (eOC148) is the first one to display distinctly superior activity for AXL
compared to its most closely related kinases MER, RET, and FLT3. However,
it is also important to note that the herein reported macrocyclization
strategy negatively impacted the potency of the analog to inhibit
AXL relative to the open conformation (32.5-fold reduction in potency),
indicating that there is still room for improvement.

To shed
light on the preferential inhibition of AXL over RET, docking
studies were conducted using the available crystal structures of the
proteins (PDB entries: 5U6B(22) and 2IVV,23 respectively). Computational strategy and analyses are
described in full in the Supporting Information. The 155 conformational structures of 1 yielded by
MacroModel sampling were docked at the active site of the AXL kinase
domain using Autodock 4.2.6.24 As shown
in Figure 4A, the predicted
binding pose of compound 1 displays the piperazino-pyridinyl
branch oriented toward a negatively charged region (in red) corresponding
to the glycine-rich G-loop of the N-lobe (see Supporting Information). The positively charged piperazine
(protonated at physiological pH) forms a H-bond with Gly545 in one
of the most flexible parts of the N-lobe, responsible for positioning
the γ-phosphate of ATP for catalysis (Supporting Information, Figure S4). Moreover, its newly incorporated
triazole ring faces the Asp690 residue
of the DFG motif and the catalytically essential Lys567, with which
it forms two H-bonds. Together with the H-bond formed by the piperazine
ring with the backbone chain of the G-loop, these interactions support
the capacity of compound 1 to inhibit AXL kinase activity.

surface representation of the AXL active site with
the predicted binding pose of 1 (light yellow). Red and
blue areas represent negatively and positively polarized areas, respectively.
(B) Antiproliferative activity of compound 1 (30 μM)
against a panel of cancer cell lines. The cell viability was analyzed
with PrestoBlue at day 5. Error bars: ± standard deviation (SD)
from n = 2.

Analogous docking studies were also performed with
the crystal
structure of RET kinase (PDB entry: 2IVV).23 The predicted
binding pose of 1 is orientated in a fashion similar
to that in AXL; however, the formation of H-bonds with Lys567 are
precluded due to a more tightened disposition of the ATP-binding cleft
that forces the ligand to move slightly away from the Lys567 residue.
This pose indicates a lower binding affinity, thus providing the rationale
for the preferential binding of compound 1 to AXL kinase
over RET.

Finally, the antiproliferative properties of 1 were
tested across a panel of eight cell lines: breast cancer MDA-MB-231,
ZR-75-1, and MCF7, glioma U87, colorectal cancer HCT116, lung adenocarcinoma
A549, and leukemia MOLM-13 and MV4–11 cells. Cells were treated
with compound 1 at 30 μM for 5 days, and the cell
viability was determined using the PrestoBlue reagent. As shown in Figure 4B, compound 1 displayed antiproliferative activity against MV4–11
cells, but not against the other cancer cell lines. This is important
because MV4–11 is an acute myeloid leukemia cell line that
has shown to be dependent on AXL signaling for survival.25 To confirm this, MV4–11 cells were treated
with macrocycle 1 over a range of concentrations (0.3–30
μM). The resulting dose–response curve (see Supporting
Information, Figure S7) provided an half-
maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of 16.6 μM.
The fact that compound 1 displays anticancer activity
against a cell line that is reliant on AXL activity for proliferation
but not in non-AXL-dependent cancer cell lines further highlights
the selectivity profile of this novel compound. The similar potency
of 1 against the recombinant AXL protein (IC50 = 13 μM) and in MV4–11 cells (EC50 = 16.6
μM) indicates that this macrocyclic construct possesses a high
capacity to cross the cell membrane.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the synthesis and characterization
of a novel 18-atom
macrocyclic structure comprising four concatenated rings is herein
reported. The construct was readily assembled using a nonsymmetrical
dimer macrocyclization strategy based on a double CuAAC reaction.
The macrocycle, which has been built from a pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold,
was designed to create a conformationally constrained analog of the
multikinase inhibitor eSM119 and displayed moderate while
selective inhibition of AXL kinase, offering a new optimization pathway
to block the activity of this cancer-associated protein kinase with
superior selectivity. Importantly, the reported synthetic method provides
a practical route for the combinatorial generation of libraries of
18-atom macrocycles by varying the benzene ring, the 6:5 fused heterocyclic
core, and their substituents, to explore additional chemical space
with pharmacological potential. The docking studies also suggest that
the on-target potency could be improved by locking the structure at
the right conformation. Future efforts will be focused on optimizing
the structure substituents and the macrocyclic ring size and conformational
freedom, for example, by switching the benzene ring to 5-membered
heterocycles or making homologs7 by eliminating
one or more of the macrocyclic CH2 groups.

Kinase Screening Assay
The radioisotope-based assay
([γ-33P]-ATP) consisted of measuring 33P incorporation induced by each kinase (AXL, TYRO3, MER, RET, or
FLT3) on the substrate poly [Glu, Tyr] 4:1 in the presence of eSM119
and compound 1 relative to DMSO. Experiments were performed by Reaction
Biology Corp.. Compounds’ IC50 values were determined from
1:3 dilution curves starting at 10 μM (10 points in total) with
10 μM ATP.

Cell Viability Assays
MDA-MB-231, MCF7, U87, HCT116,
and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine
and incubated in a Heracell 240i tissue culture incubator at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. ZR-75-1, MOLM-13, and MV4-11 cells were grown
under the same conditions with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
instead of DMEM. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1500 (HCT116
and A549), 2000 (MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and U87), or 4000 cells/well (MOLM-13
and MV4–11 cells) in 95 (suspension cells) or 100 μL
(for adherent cells) of supplemented medium. Adherent cells were incubated
for 48 h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The
media was then aspirated from each well and replaced with 95 μL
of fresh medium. Suspension cells were treated on the same date that
they were seeded. Then, 5 μL of a DMSO solution of compound
1 at 600 μM was added to each well containing cells to obtain
a final concentration of 30 μM. Untreated cells were incubated
with DMSO (0.1% v/v). After 5 d, the PrestoBlue cell viability reagent
(10 μL) was added to each well, and the plates incubated for
0.5–4 h (MV4–11 required 3 h of incubation). Fluorescence
emission was detected using an Envision fluorescence plate reader
(excitation 540 nm, emission 590 nm). All conditions were normalized
to the untreated cells (100%). For the dose–response study,
MV4–11 cells were seeded in 96-well plates as described before. Serial 1:3 dilutions of
compound 1 in DMSO were prepared in a separate 96-well intermediate
plate. Then, 5 μL from the intermediate plate was added to each
well containing cells. The determination of cell viability was performed
at day 5 as described before, and the results were normalized to the
untreated cells (100%). Curves were fitted using a four-parameter
logistic fit with the minimum value constrained to zero using the
GraphPad Prism software to calculate EC50 values.
