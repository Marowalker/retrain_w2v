Facilitating catalyst accessibility of H2 and
NOx at the catalyst surface remains a
great
challenge in catalytic selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The efficient
conversion of NOx into N2 under
mild conditions is an attractive pathway as SCR usually requires high
operating temperature which consumes extra operating energy and restricts
the possible locations of an SCR device. The H2 supply
concentration of conventional H2-SCR is relatively sparse
(0.5–2%), which leads to a relatively high operating temperature
to activate H. We developed a H2-SCR process with the monolithic
catalyst which combined with localized rarefied hydrogen enrichment
enhanced by porous nickel and adsorption of NOx on Mn oxide with only 0.08, 0.25, and 0.42% palladium can
achieve over 80% NO removal efficiency at 120, 100, and 90 °C.
Maximizing the role of nickel foam-fixed hydrogen and Mn oxide in
combination with NO can provide enriched NOx and H2 atmosphere for adjustable valence state
Pd to yield positive catalytic behavior.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Aggravation of air pollution
has motivated an intense research
effort aimed at improving the state of the atmospheric environment,
and NOx has been regarded as an important
environmental pollution source. SCR (selective catalytic reduction)
is generally accepted as the dominant denitrification technology.
The current mainstream technology NH3-SCR required a high
operating temperature that restricts the location of the SCR device
and must be placed before the flue gas desulfurization and the dust-extraction
unit; as a consequence, the inevitable toxic effect of SO2 limits the lifetime of the catalyst. For many existing rectification
factories, very little space is available for adding additional waste
gas treatment equipment. Therefore, a lower operating temperature
and environmentally friendly SCR technology H2-SCR is emerging
as a promising technique in denitrification.1−8 Its low operating temperature makes it possible for the flexible
placement of the SCR device, for example, with the SCR device placed
after the desulfurizer or the dust-extraction unit. This has a significant
positive effect on the life of the catalyst and therefore, lowers
the cost of denitrification.

Although, H2-SCR can
operate at low temperatures and
solve the problem of the energy dissipation, hydrogen storage is harsh
and limited. Hence, various online hydrogen production technologies
have emerged such as steam methane reforming and auto-thermal reforming
of diesel fuel.9 Meanwhile, the H2 supply concentration of conventional H2-SCR is relatively
sparse (0.5–2%), which leads to a relatively high operating
temperature to provide H activation. The efficient utilization of
hydrogen resources is still a major challenge in the field that must
be overcome.

Conventional H2-SCR catalysts are mainly
based on noble
metals, mostly using Pt and Pd.10−13 Although the use of Pt or Pd as an active component
meets the process requirements, the costly high operating temperature
limits their practical application. Therefore, to support the implementation
of H2-SCR, it is necessary to maximize the effective utilization
of trace noble metal at lower temperatures and to search for a base
metal substitute for Pt and Pd.

Earth-abundant nonnoble metal
elements such as transition metals
(e.g., Co, Fe, Cu, and Mn) have been reported to show extraordinary
SCR activity at low temperatures.10,14−23 The multivalent nature of these oxides could facilitate the redox
activity of the catalyst which is attributed to the enhancement of
efficiency. Nickel foam is attractive, given its desirable three-dimensional
structure and excellent H adsorption capacity,23−27 which has been widely used as an electrode substrate
commercial material. With its favorable 3D cross-linked grid structure
and capacity of H2 adsorption, it can not only localize
rarefied hydrogen enrichment but also expose more active materials
per unit. Hence, nickel foam can be the substitution of non-noble
host structures of choice.

In this work, we developed a H2-SCR process with the
monolithic catalyst which combined with localized rarefied hydrogen
enrichment enhanced by porous nickel and adsorption of NOx on Mn oxide with only 0.08, 0.25, and 0.42% palladium
can achieve over 80% NO removal efficiency at 120, 100, and 90 °C
under conditions of 2% O2 and gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) = 32 000 h–1. We emphasize the role
of nickel foam and Mn oxide, which provide Pd with an enriched NOx and H2 atmosphere for improving
reaction efficiency. Via various characterization methods, such as
morphology characterization and surface element chemical valence and
composition detection, the likely reaction process of denitrification
was elucidated. Because of its low operating temperature and high
efficiency, our candidate catalyst has the advantage of a more flexible
selection of the flue gas denitrification location.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
All analytical
grade (AR) reagents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co. LTD without further purification. Before nickel foam was put into
use, it needed to be pretreated to ensure the removal of the probable
oxidation layer and organic substances on its surface. Mn (NO3)2 and PdCl2 were deployed into a precise
concentration solution, respectively.

In a typical synthesis,
a calculated amount of preconfigured Mn (NO3)2 and PdCl2 solution were infused in a 100 ml beaker under
magnetic stirring for 30 min. During stirring, 0.3 g NaOH, 500 μL
H2O2, and 114 mg NaBH4 were added
to make mixed solutions. The mixture was then transferred to a high-pressure
reactor lined with a Teflon liner for 12 h of hydrothermal reaction
at 150 °C. After the reaction process, the autoclave was allowed
to cool down naturally. Then the products were leached with deionized
water several times. The desired catalysts were obtained and denoted
as the PdOx–Mn3O4 catalyst.

As for the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst: 40 mg (19.35%
loading percentage)
of the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4 catalyst was distributed in 5 mL isopropanol upon ultrasonic
vibration followed by the impregnation method to obtain the desired
catalysts. Besides, the purified single foamed nickel was used as
the blank control group.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
Different
characterization methods were used to exhibit the internal structure
of the catalyst: X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded between
10 and 80° by using a D/max 2550 V X-ray diffractometer with
a copper target (k = 1.5406 Å) and operating
at 40 kV and 100 mA. The elementary composition and morphology characteristics
of the samples were examined by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
using an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (Falion 60S), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS. Field-emission SEM (FESEM)
was using to gain EDS color mapping. The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HTEM) images were used to further
demonstrate the topographic characteristics equipped with a JEM-2100
transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was conducted by point and neutral neutralization electron
gun; ion beam EX06 device, and XR6 micro focusing monochromatized
XPS (Al Kα) device, which determined the surface valence state
of the catalyst. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis was
carried out using a Micromeritics Tristar II 3020 apparatus and the
subsequent information about the specific surface area, pore volume,
and average pore size of the samples were then computed using
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller model.

H2-TPR (temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen) and NH3-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia) were conducted
by an automatic temperature-rising chemical adsorber (Micromeritics,
Autochem II 2920). Before adsorption on the surface of the catalyst,
the 50 mg dry catalyst samples need to be pretreated under 300 °C
within 60 min to remove the impurities and moisture. In H2-TPR experiments, the sample was exposed to 10% H2/Ar
reduction gas (40 ml/min), and the temperature was elevated continuously
at 10 °C/min to 800 °C. In the NH3-TPD experiments:
the sample was first exposed to 10% NH3/He mixture (40
mL/min) under 50 °C, to complete the adsorption of NH3 60 min; then switched to He gas (40 mL/min) purification within
60 min; finally the temperature was elevated continuously at 10 °C/min
to 800 °C.

2.3 Catalytic Activity Procedure
The
synthetic catalyst was placed in a fixed-bed flow reactor for H2-SCR. The simulated flue gas containing 900–1000 ppm
NO, x % O2, 9000–10 000
ppm H2, and N2 as balance gas was used in the
H2-SCR reaction. A GHSV of about 32 000 h–1 was maintained by a Brooks thermal mass flowmeter. During the reaction,
the temperature was controlled within the scope of 50–150 °C
by K-type thermocouples inside and outside the fixed bed. The concentration
of gas in the effluent of the reactor was analyzed using the online
chemiluminescence NO–NO2–NOx analyzer (Thermofisher, 42i model). The final total conversion
is calculated with the stable data. The eqs 1–3 used to calculate
the NO conversion, H2 conversion, and N2 selectivity
were 1   2   3  where [NO]in, [H2]in, [NO]out, and [H2]out represents
the inlet and outlet gas concentration of the system at each temperature.
N2O concentration and H2 concentration were
analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC 7890) equipped with a
Hayesep Q column (i.d. 2 mm, length 35 cm), and a thermal conductivity
detector.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthetic Method, Structural, and Morphological
Characterization of the PdOx–Mn3O4@Nickel Foam Catalyst
The fabrication
of the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel catalyst is schematically described in Figure 1 and involves a facile two-step
route detailed in the Experimental Section: first, using the hydrothermal method to acquire PdOx–Mn3O4 and then obtaining
the loaded PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst by impregnation (detailed in Experimental Section). According to our synthetic
process (displayed in Figure 1c), the solution environment could form birnessite at ambient
temperatures, and then during the hydrothermal method, Pd nanoparticles
begin to grow dispersive, hence avoiding agglomeration of catalysts.
The three-dimensional cross-linked grid structure of the foamed nickel
can be observed by SEM images in Figure 1a,b, which provided high porosity to enlarge
the more specific surface area and exposed more possible active sites.
Comparing Figure 1b
with 1a, impregnation by PdOx–Mn3O4 resulted in a significant
morphology change in the foamed nickel surface. As observed from the
TEM image presented in Figure 1b, flaky, polyhedral Mn3O4 with uniformly
dispersed Pd nanoparticles (marked by red circles) was revealed, forming
a regular three-dimensional and hierarchical porous superstructure.

of Pd nanoparticles; (f): red lines denote the Pd lattice spacing;
yellow lines denote the lattice spacing of base Mn3O4; illustration denotes the SAED pattern of PdO and Mn3O4 crystals].

XRD patterns and the corresponding HTEM images
of the samples were
further obtained to characterize the composition of the samples. PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel
foam samples (shown in Figure S1) exhibited
distinct XRD peaks at 29.0, 32.4, 36.0, and 60.2° of the (112),
(103), (211), and (224) reflection planes, respectively, which correspond
to Mn3O4 (hausmannite, PDF 18-0803). The grain
size of the catalysts was calculated using Scherrer’s formula,
and it was found that the average crystal size was about 30.6 nm,
which matched well with the HTEM images. With the increasing of Pd,
still, no obvious Pd or PdO peaks were observed, which is possibly
because the uniformly dispersed PdOx nanoparticles
were too small to reach the detection limit. The material has a spinel
mesostructure of tetrahedral crystals as determined by TEM. Pd nanoparticles
were observed (marked by a blue ellipse in Figure 1e) and were highly dispersed on the parallelogram
surface of Mn3O4. In more detail, the inset
figure in Figure 1e
showed that the Pd nanoparticles were anchored evenly over the Mn3O4 hosts and had a narrow distribution in the average
size of 3 to 10 nm. The lattice fringes of the material displayed
interplanar spacings of 1.74 and 1.60 Å in the particles, which
matched well, respectively, with those of the Mn3O4 (312) crystal plane and the PdO (200) crystal plane, the
inset figure in Figure 1f showed the SAED pattern of PdO and Mn3O4 crystals.
The d-spacing of the Pd lattice stripes is smaller
than that of pure PdO, which indicated that various Pd element forms
exist. FESEM was used to reveal the elemental composition of the catalyst,
and the results were in line with expectations (shown in Figure S2).

3.2 H2-SCR Evaluation, Valence States,
and Redox Capacity of the PdOx–Mn3O4@Nickel Foam Catalyst
As the Pd content
increased, the denitrification efficiency of the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst improved.
Notably, unlike for the other reported medium-temperature area Pd-based
catalysts,10 the temperature window of
the de-NOx reaction was advanced. Remarkably,
trace Pd doping of 0.08% PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam still enabled the removal of nearly
90% NO at 120 °C. The enhancement of denitrification efficiency
may be related to the change in valence, the increase in the oxygen
vacancy content, and the variety in the acid content on the surface.

X-ray photoelectron spectra of the samples were measured to gain
insight into the element chemical valence at the surface. As the main
catalytically active center of the reaction, the Pd nanoparticles
show a significant splitting between the Pd 3d orbital peaks. Two
different photoelectron peaks that were ascribed to the metallic Pd
species and Pd2+ were observed at approximately 335.1 and
340.8 eV, respectively. According to the synthesis steps, the addition
of NaBH4 should reduce some of the Pd atoms from the divalent
states to the metallic state, giving rise to a partial split peak.
With the increasing of Pd, the split peak also showed an increasing
trend (shown in Figure S2c), while loading
on nickel foam, a more obvious split peak was emerged (shown
in Figure 2b). Because
foamed nickel could enhance the ability of ion transport and maintain
very smooth electron channels,28 so it
can provide Pd a place to transform electrons, which attributed to
the increase of the split peak of the low valence state Pd.

with different Pd contents tested in a fixed bed. The simulated flue
gas including 1070 ppm of NO, 10 700 ppm of H2,
2% O2, and a GHSV of 32 000 h–1, using N2 as balance gas; XPS patterns of (b) Pd 3d spectra
of the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4 and PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; (c) Mn 2p spectra of the
prepared PdOx–Mn3O4 and PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; and (d) O 1s spectra of the prepared
PdOx–Mn3O4 and PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst.

The splitting of the Mn 3s peaks was because of
the interaction
between the nonionized 3s electrons and the three-dimensional valence
band electrons, showing the difference in the actual Mn oxidation
state. Generally, the Mn 3s peak splitting width varies from 4.5 to
6.0 eV. MnO2 peaks are found at approximately 4.5 eV, while
those of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 are observed at approximately 5.5 eV, and those of MnO are observed
at approximately 5.9 eV.29 Upon Pd ion
doping, Mn 3s splitting increased from 5.58 to 5.67, and when Mn3O4 was placed on nickel foam, Mn 3s peak division
increased to 5.71 eV (shown in Figures 2c and S2a). This indicates
that the average Mn oxidation state decreased and was between +3 and
+4. This is in good agreement with the Mn 2p level binding energy
change (shown in Figure.S2b). Differences
in the Pd content of the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst appeared to increase the
MnIV content, which may have led to enhanced denitrification.

The strongest O 1s photoelectron peak (Figure 2d) with a binding energy of approximately
529.3 eV was attributed to lattice oxygen. The PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst O
1s orbitals showed an extra splitting peak. The presence of Mn–O–Mn
(529.3–530.3 eV), Mn–OH (530.5–531.5 eV), Ni–O
(529.0–531.0 eV), Ni–OH (530.8–531.7 eV), and
H–O–H (531.8–532.8 eV) could be attributed to
various chemisorbed hydroxyl (OH−) groups. These chemical adsorptions
of oxygen could provide more oxygen vacancies that contributed to
NO adsorption and dissociation.30

To further illustrate the possible reasons at the enhancement of
deNOx performance by our candidate, H2-TPR coupled with NH3-TPD technology XPS methods
were further performed, which could obtain more information in materials’
redox capability. Figure 3a shows the characterization results of catalyst H2-TPR. Both the catalysts had negative peaks at 73 and 75 °C
that indicated that palladium oxide was reduced to Pd metal. The reduction
temperatures of 196 and 213 °C as shown in Figure 3a are much lower than expected. H2 reduction peaks on MnOx/TiO2 reported at 282 °C were attributed to the transformation from
MnO2 to Mn2O3; the peak at 348 °C
was attributed to the transformation of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 and the peak at 432 °C was attributed
to the transformation of Mn3O4 to MnO.31 The activated hydrogen can be absorbed on the
surface of Pd particles by dissociation and reduce Mnn+ species, making the position of reduction peak
shift to low temperature.32,33 The coexistence of
different reduction peaks further indicate the presence of a mixture
of manganese oxides Pd nanoparticles, loaded on the above foamed nickel
supporter, exposed more active sites for hydrogen dissociation, so
the consumption of the activated H atom accelerated the adsorption
rate of fresh hydrogen, thus enhancing the activity. The synergistic
effects between Pd, Mn, and Ni were prone to changing the oxidation
state of a catalyst under the reaction conditions, which intensively
altered the species of chemisorbed oxygen. Added oxygen vacancies
on the catalyst activated the adsorption of NOx and oxygen and therefore facilitated the H2-SCR
reaction.

Figure 3 (a) H2-TPR and (b) NH3-TPD profiles of the
PdOx–Mn3O4 catalyst and the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam sample.

The ammonia temperature-programmed method (NH3-TPD)
(shown in Figure 3 b)
confirmed the increase in the number of acid sites. Based on the data
in the literature,34 the strong physical
adsorption of NH3 and surface chemical adsorption of the
NH3 stripping peak correspond to the alpha peak in the
temperature range of 100–150 °C. Moreover, the NH3 stripping peak attributed to the defects and weak Brønsted
and Lewis acid was the beta peak, and its stripping temperature was
between 150 and 300 °C. According to the NH3 desorption
temperature, the acid can be defined as strong acid (250–350
°C), super strong acid (>500 °C), and weak acid (<250
°C).35 Therefore, the different peak
patterns of the PdOx–Mn3O4 catalyst and PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst corresponded to ammonia
and the combination of the catalyst surface acid sites. It is observed
that the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst displayed two obvious stripping peaks
at 385 and 685 °C, respectively, and the increasing number of
acid sites is strong acid sites. Nickel oxide can broaden the distribution
of acid sites, which make the catalyst more advantageous for the reduction
of nitric oxide.

3.3 Optimized H2-SCR Catalyst Performance
Unlike the bare nickel foam and PdOx–Mn3O4, the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst exhibited
90% denitrification conversion at an ultra-low-temperature of 90 °C,
which was much better than the results obtained for other known Pd-based
catalysts (Figure 4f). Different impact factors were discussed in this section.

Figure 4 H2-SCR performance of the prepared PdOx-Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst tested in
a fixed bed. The simulated flue gas including 1070 ppm NO, 10 700
ppm H2, 2% O2, and a GHSV of 32 000 h–1, using N2 as balance gas; (a) effect of
different O2 feed concentrations on NO conversion over
the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; (b) effect of GHSV on NO conversion
by H2-SCR over the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; (c) effect
of the H2/NO ratio on NO conversion by H2-SCR
over the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; (d) H2 conversion
over the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; (e) N2 selectivity
over the prepared PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst; and (f) H2-SCR performance
comparison of different known catalysts at 90 °C.

For most catalysts, excess O2 will strongly
inhibit
the reduction of NO, as the oxidation of the H2 reducing
agent will greatly reduce the effect of the reducing agent.11,36,37 As for our candidate, H2 conversion was exhibited on a high level within a tested scale (Figure 4d), which indicated
that the unexpected side reaction of H2–O2 combustion can be effectively avoided at low temperatures. Moreover,
O2 can also act as a promoter; however, NO oxide was found
in the adsorbed state of nitrate or nitrite, and H2 then
has a stronger effect for the reduction of nitrate or nitrite, thus
increasing the strong H2 reducing capability of the SCR
technology.38 In Figure 4a, with the increase in the O2 concentration, the PdOx–Mn3O4@nickel foam catalyst also showed less obstruction
of NOx conversion.

The whole denitrification
conversion curve is a typical volcanic
curve that was repeatedly observed in previous work.10,39 Two maximum removal efficiency temperatures were found. With GHSV
increasing, the conversion of NO dropped from 92 to 73%. Owing to
the three-dimensional space structure inside nickel foam, a large
amount of the reaction gas could be absorbed and stored in this extremely
large space. Hence, the reaction has a certain buffer effect, improving
its ability to resist to a certain degree, so when the gas space velocity
increased within a certain range, there was less obstruction for the
catalyst H2-SCR denitrification effect. However, when the
gas space velocity increased to 43 000 h–1 because of the large gas space velocity, the nickel foam cushion
was not sufficient to maintain the full reaction, and the reaction
contact time between the catalyst and the simulated gas was too short,
leading to an obvious decrease in the NO removal efficiency.

It was found that an increase in the H2/NO ratio was
advantageous to the H2-SCR denitrification. Generally,
the NO removal efficiency of the catalysts was comparatively high
for different H2/NO ratios. For H2/NO = 5, only
58% removal efficiency was maintained, indicating that the H2/NO ratio had little influence on the catalyst. The effect of the
H2/NO ratio on the catalyst was attributed mainly to the
effect of nickel foam because nickel foam has very high adsorption
ability, it sets the role of hydrogen, and the effect of the H2/NO ratio on the catalyst was weak within certain limits.

N2 selectivity has also been tested in our project,
thus the main byproduct N2O is verified by our experiments.
Pd content showed a significant effect on N2 selectivity,
and coupled with better NO conversion, our candidate had an increasing
trend on N2 selectivity with the increase in the testing
temperature.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we developed
a H2-SCR process which combined
localized hydrogen enrichment enhanced by a porous nickel with NOx adsorption on the modified Mn oxide catalyst.
Doped with 0.08, 0.25, and 0.42% palladium, the monolithic catalyst
can achieve over 80% NO removal at 120, 100, and 90 °C, respectively.
Mn oxide prefers the combination with NO and could anchor well-dispersed
Pd nanoparticles on the surface, so the catalyst achieved two functions
simultaneously: (1) enrichment of H2 by nickel foam via
physical and chemical adsorption and (2) conversion of NOx by Pd. The possible reaction process on the monolithic-modified
manganese catalyst was revealed by XPS, NH3-TPD, and H2-TPR. We proposed that a variety of active substances contained
in the catalyst may have contributed to the enhanced deNOx activity. As a consequence, the results achieved
in the current study support the further exploration of such an approach
toward the economical and rational design of the catalysts for efficient
H2-SCR and are also beneficial to practical applications.
