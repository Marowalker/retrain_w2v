Sn-based alloy materials are strong
candidates to replace graphitic
carbon as the anode for the next generation lithium-ion batteries
because of their much higher gravimetric and volumetric capacity.
A series of nanosize SnyFe alloys derived
from the chemical transformation of preformed Sn nanoparticles as
templates have been synthesized and characterized. An optimized Sn5Fe/Sn2Fe anode with a core–shell structure
delivered 541 mAh·g–1 after 200 cycles at the
C/2 rate, retaining close to 100% of the initial capacity. Its volumetric
capacity is double that of commercial graphitic carbon. It also has
an excellent rate performance, delivering 94.8, 84.3, 72.1, and 58.2%
of the 0.1 C capacity (679.8 mAh/g) at 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively.
The capacity is recovered upon lowering the rate. The exceptional
cycling/rate capability and higher gravimetric/volumetric capacity
make the SnyFe alloy a potential candidate
as the anode in lithium-ion batteries. The understanding of SnyFe alloys from this work also provides insight
for designing other Sn–M (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, etc.) system.

1 Introduction
Rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries have become the most important
energy storage device for a wide range of technological applications,
including portable communication electronics, hybrid electric vehicles
(HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs), and large-scale renewable grid
storage because of their high energy density and long cycle life.1−8 Because the Sony company successfully commercialized the Li-ion
battery in 1990s, graphitic carbons have remained as the anode. However,
the ever-increasing energy density needs for mass deployment of EVs
have highlighted the limitations of carbon-based materials: their
low gravimetric/volumetric capacity (340 mAh/g or 740 Ah/L) and poor
high rate capability, which limits charging rates because of the potential
nucleation and growth of lithium dendrites.9 To satisfy the energy requirement of EVs, electrochemically active
materials such as Si,10 Ge,11 and Sn12−14 have received much attention
for their higher gravimetric/volumetric capacity (SiLi4.4: 2005 mAh/g or 2444 mAh/cc, GeLi4.4: 1143 mAh/g or 1848
mAh/cc, SnLi4.4: 789 mAh/g or 2038 mAh/cc) and safer thermodynamic
potential. Tin-based materials are scientifically one of the most
promising candidates as they possess good conductivity and are nontoxic.
However, a volume expansion of 257% on the complete reaction with
Sn causes cracking/pulverization of the particles, potentially losing
the connection with a current collector, and then failure of the electrode,
resulting in a rapid deterioration in the cycling.14−19

Substantial efforts have been made to overcome these problems,
including the design and exploration of nanostructure materials,20,21 which could effectively reduce the absolute volume expansion, shorten
the transport length of ions and electrons, and enhance permeation
of electrolyte, thus improving the reaction kinetics during the lithiation/delithiation
process. Forming Sn–M (M: inactive metal) alloy and Sn–C
composite has two fascinating methods. Dispersing nano-Sn particles
in a carbon matrix with some void space that can act as a “buffer
zone” to alleviate the volume change is one approach to improve
the electrochemically cycling and rate performance. For example, the
electrodes of porous TiO2–x-C-Sn
nanofibers,22 Sn nanoparticles encapsulated
in graphene-backboned carbonaceous foam (F-G/Sn@C),23 hierarchical Sn/C composite,24 ultrasmall Sn nanoparticles embedded in spherical hollow carbon,25 double network hydrogel-derived ultrafine Sn–Fe
alloy in a three-dimensional carbon framework,26 and so forth improve the cycling stability and capacity.
Nevertheless, the introduction of a mass carbon source (graphene,
amorphous porous carbon, ordered mesoporous carbon, and carbon nanotubes/nanofibers)
and a void space will reduce the cell overall energy density, especially
volumetric energy density. Moreover, multiple complicated steps in
the synthesis process will impede their practical application. Sn–M
(M = Fe,27,28 Co,29,30 Ni,31 Cu,32 Mn,33 and so forth) alloy anode materials have been explored
due to their good electronic conductivity, high tap density, and gravimetric/volumetric
capacity (shown in Figure 1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). The volumetric capacity of Sn5Fe and Sn2Fe intermetallics is more than 2.5 times that of graphite based on
the lithiated products. Fe is also nontoxic and low cost, which could
help to prevent the Sn particles from aggregating and stabilizing
the structure of the electrode, thus improving the electrochemical
cycle life. Dahn reported earlier on the Sn–Fe system including
Sn2Fe-C,34 SnyFe (Sn2Fe, SnFe, Sn2Fe3, and Sn3Fe5),35 and Sn2Fe: SnFe3C active/inactive composites.36 However, the capacity faded rapidly with only
200 mAh·g–1 after 80 cycles, and they concluded
that Sn–Co was the ideal couple.37 Our group previously reported, using high-energy ball milling, nanosized
Sn–Fe–C nanoparticles could obtain 440 mAh/g after 170
cycles at a C/10 rate by adjusting the grinding media, reducing agent,
total grinding time, graphite content, different carbon type, and
Ti content.38,39 Compared with mechanochemistry,
nanocrystal conversion chemistry could result in lower reaction temperatures
and better control of the morphology as well as avoiding melting of
Sn metal.40−42

Figure 1 Theoretical gravimetric and volumetric capacities (the
data was
based on the amounts and the densities of the lithiated products).
Black and red bars denote gravimetric and volumetric capacities, respectively.

Therefore, in this work, we used
a nanocrystal conversion chemistry
approach and successfully synthesized a series of SnyFe alloys. The morphology, crystal structure, and composition
of SnyFe intermetallic products were found
to be greatly influenced by a temperature and reagent molar ratio.
Furthermore, Sn5Fe–Sn2Fe electrodes with
a core–shell structure showed excellent cycling and rate capacity.
They delivered 541 mAh·g–1 after 200 cycles
at 0.5 C rate, corresponding to nearly 100% initial capacity, with
a volumetric capacity almost twice that of carbon. This work on SnyFe alloys also provides insight for designing
other Sn–M (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and so forth) system for next
generation Li-ion batteries.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Materials Synthesis and Characterizations
Figure 2a schematically
displays the preparation steps of the SnyFe alloy. Generally, the growth process includes two stages: the
formation of Sn nanoparticles and their subsequent transformation.
The addition of the reducing agent (NaBH4) to the Sn salt
quickly creates Sn nanospheres through a self-assembly process in
the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and 1  poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline)
(PEtOx) surfactants, as shown in reaction 1.43 Here, the high-boiling
(310 °C) polyalcohol solvent, tetraethylene glycol (TEG), plays
a significant role in the formation of the resulting materials.44 After the first step, the Fe source was injected
into the solution; then, intermetallic SnyFe nanoparticles were formed typically via a diffusion-based process
where Fe diffuses into Sn.41 2  By adjusting
the molar ratio of SnCl2 to FeCl3, we could
obtain SnyFe intermetallics with different
structures and compositions, including core–shell structures
(Figure 2b). The four
materials synthesized with molar ratios of 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1, and 2:1
are designated as Sn-Fe-1, Sn-Fe-2, Sn-Fe-3 (FeSn5@FeSn2), and Sn-Fe-4.

Figure 2 (a) Schematic illustration of the procedure
for the preparation
of SnyFe alloy nanoparticles. (b) Structure
change of the SnyFe alloys in different
reagent molar ratio between the SnCl2 and FeCl3.

The Rietveld analysis of powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 3) of these four SnyFe materials
formed at 110 °C showed that
the diffraction peaks were those of Sn5Fe (PDF Card No.
00-064-0036) and Sn2Fe (PDF Card No. 04-001-0929) with
the P4/mcc space group. The weighted R-factor Rwp of the four samples
are 5.62, 4.83, 2.14, and 5.56%. The diffraction peaks at 29.1, 30.5,
32.9, 41.6, 42.6, 44.5, 52.4, and 55.6° can be assigned to the
(210), (002), (211), (310), (212), (311), (312), and (213) planes
of the Sn5Fe phase, respectively, and 33.7, 35.1, 39.2,
43.9, 61.1, and 70.7° are associated with the (002), (211), (112),
(202), (213), and (004) planes of the Sn2Fe phase, respectively.
The refined lattice parameters of the Sn5Fe and Sn2Fe phases in the four samples are shown in Table S2. There was no evidence of any intermediate phase
between Sn5Fe and Sn2Fe.

Figure 3 XRD patterns and refinements
of the materials synthesized at 110
°C for reagent molar ratios of SnCl2 to FeCl3 from 10:1 to 2:1. Black line: observed profile; red line: calculated
profile; blue line: difference profile.

For molar ratios (SnCl2:FeCl3) of 10:1
and
5:1, only the tetragonal Sn5Fe phase was observed. The
Sn-Fe-1 sample had a Sn/Fe molar ratio of 7.7, which is Sn5Fe0.65, not the stoichiometric Sn5Fe. This
Fe defect structure is supported by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) measurement (Supporting Information, Table S3). The Rietveld refinement also showed that the weight ratio
of Sn5Fe nanoparticles decreased from 40.3 to 13.6% as
the reagent (SnCl2:FeCl3) molar ratio decreased
from 2.5:1 to 2:1. Thus, the Sn5Fe phase is found at all
reactant molar ratios at 110 °C, but the Sn2Fe phase
is not found at the highest Sn ratios. In contrast, at 170 °C,
even at the highest Sn ratio, the Sn2Fe peak at 34.9°
could be observed (Figure S1), and pure
phase Sn2Fe was formed at the lower Sn ratios. This suggests
that the stability of the Sn5Fe alloy decreases with increasing
temperature and that the phases formed can be controlled by both temperature
and reactant ratio. This change of crystal structure and composition
for the SnyFe alloy system might provide
insight also into the Sn5M (M = Fe, Co or FeCo and so on)
alloys and their formation.

The morphology and composition of
the SnyFe materials were further characterized
using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure 4a–h, the primary
particle sizes of the four materials are tens of nanometers, and the
morphology changes with increasing Fe reactant content from spherical
to cubic to ultrasmall/irregular particles. This may be due to the
anisotropic Kirkendall effect.45 The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) (Figure 4i–l) gives a good agreement with the
XRD results: Sn5Fe for Sn-Fe-1 and Sn-Fe-2, Sn5Fe@Sn2Fe for Sn-Fe-3, and Sn2Fe for Sn-Fe-4.
High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Figure 4m–p) show that all the
particles have a crystalline core covered by an amorphous oxide shell
formed during exposure to air.46 In addition,
clear lattice fringes with interplanar distances of ≈0.292,
≈0.271, and ≈0.252 nm in Figure 4m,n,p can be indexed to the (002) plane of
crystalline Sn5Fe, the (211) plane of crystalline Sn5Fe, and the (211) plane of crystalline Sn2Fe, respectively,
which further verify the compositions of these samples.

SAED images, and (m–p) HRTEM images zooming in local area in
corresponding TEM images of the four materials: Sn-Fe-1, Sn-Fe-2,
Sn-Fe-3, and Sn-Fe-4.

To determine the composite distribution of Sn-Fe-3, the Sn5Fe@Sn2Fe material, fast Fourier transform (FFT)
diffractions are shown in Figure 5 on regions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Figure 4o. The corresponding FFT spots show that
regions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the single particle are dominated by Sn2Fe, Sn5Fe, Sn5Fe, and Sn2Fe phase, respectively, which indicates a core–shell structure
for the Sn5Fe@Sn2Fe material, where the core
is Sn5Fe with a shell of Sn2Fe. Considering
the composition change from Sn5Fe to Sn5Fe@Sn2Fe to Sn2Fe with increased Fe reactant content,
the formation process may be that at a low Fe reactant content, Sn5Fe is preferred to be formed, because Sn5Fe is
the phase intermediate between Sn and Sn2Fe;47 when more Fe reactant is added, Sn5Fe will transform to Sn2Fe from the surface of the particle;
when more and more Fe reactant is added, the transformation from Sn5Fe to Sn2Fe will go through the whole particle
forming Sn2Fe.

and 4 in Figure 4o.

Figure 6a–d
represents the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image
of the four materials, and some particles were selected to do the
EDX elemental line scanning of Fe and Sn for them. The molar ratios
(shown in Figure 6e–h)
of Fe and Sn were calculated based on the EDS line scanning experiment
to determine the distribution. The calculated molar ratios (Figure 6e–h) of Sn/Fe
for Sn-Fe-1, Sn-Fe-2, and Sn-Fe-4 are approximately 8, 5.0, and 2.3,
indicating the existence of massive Fe defects for Sn-Fe-1, which
are the perfect Sn5Fe and Sn2Fe phase for Sn-Fe-2
and Sn-Fe-4 samples. The most interesting one is the Sn-Fe-3 sample,
which gives a higher molar ratio of Sn/Fe in the core of a particle
and it verifies our speculation of a core (Sn5Fe)–shell
(Sn2Fe) structure.

2.2 Electrochemical Performance
of the SnyFe Nanoparticles
Electrochemical
reactions
for the first five cycles for the four SnyFe materials synthesized in 110 °C were investigated by cyclic
voltammetry (CV, Figure S2) at a scan rate
of 0.05 mV/s in a voltage window of 0.005–1.5 V versus Li+/Li. The broad cathodic peak located around 1.25 V in the
first cycle is ascribed to the formation of solid-electrolyte interface
(SEI) films, which disappeared for the following cycles, consuming
Li ions and resulting in mainly irreversible capacity loss. The reduction
peaks below 0.3 V for the lithium insertion process are assigned to
the formation of LixSn alloys. Two anodic
peaks at 0.55 and 0.65 V were attributed to Li extraction reaction,
which corresponds to the reversible dealloying process. Figure 7 displays the voltage profiles
of the SnyFe anodes in the initial five
charge/discharge cycles between 0.01 and 1.5 V at a current rate of
0.1 C (1 C = 600 mAh·g–1). The theoretical
capacities of Sn-Fe-1, Sn-Fe-2, Sn-Fe-3, and Sn-Fe-4 materials are
935.9, 900.3, 851.8, and 827.1 mAh·g–1 based
on the EDS composition and formation of Li4.4Sn + Fe. The
first lithium insertion/removal cycle of Sn-Fe-1, Sn-Fe-2, Sn-Fe-3,
and Sn-Fe-4 delivered capacities of 1498/561, 1499.4/537.9, 1617.9/645.8,
and 1592.2/830.3 mAh·g–1, respectively, corresponding
to the Coulombic efficiencies (CE) of 37.4, 35.9, 39.9, and 52.1%.
The large irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle is mainly
attributed to electrolyte decomposition/formation of the SEI film
at the electrode/electrolyte surface and reduction of the surface
oxidized layer.46,48−50 However, the
results are comparable with nanostructure materials as anodes for
lithium-ion batteries.46,51,52

Figure 7 Galvanostatic
charge–discharge curves of the first five
cycles at C/10 (1 C = 600 mA·g–1) for (a) Sn-Fe-1,
(b) Sn-Fe-2, (c) Sn-Fe-3, and (d) Sn-Fe-4 materials.

The initial Coulombic efficiency decreases with
an increasing Sn
content, suggesting that irreversible reactions on tin cause this
excess capacity on the first reaction with lithium. This is consistent
with the slow drop in voltage in the first discharge process, when
the SEI is formed above 1 V. The plateau around 0.3 V represents the
alloying reaction between Li and Sn–Fe intermetallic forming
LixSn. As shown in the figure, except
the first cycle, the voltage plateaus due to SEI formation above 1.0
V are absent, and the cell voltage quickly falls to 0.6 V. The charging
curves display two main plateaus at ∼0.55 and ∼0.7 V,
which are ascribed to the delithiation reactions and are consistent
with the CV results.

Figure 8a,b shows
the gravimetric and volumetric capacities of the four anodes with
different Sn–Fe compositions at a current density of 0.5 C
in a voltage range of 0.01 to 1.5 V (the first five cycles were at
0.1 C rate to activate the materials). The Sn-Fe-1 anode with the
Fe defects delivered a capacity of ∼500 mAh·g–1 for 25 cycles, but the capacity quickly dropped to ∼224 mAh·g–1 after 100 cycles. Wang et al. also reported that
the Sn5Fe anode (defect structure Fe0.74Sn5) with a particle size of 41 ± 8 nm could achieve 750
mAh·g–1 in 0.05 C for 15 cycles but then decayed
rapidly.40 It appears that a minimum amount
of Fe is necessary to stabilize the overall structure and that there
is insufficient in this Fe-deficient lattice. The Fe-richer Sn-Fe-2
material had a capacity of ∼516 mAh·g–1 for 25 cycles and still had 457 mAh·g–1 after
100 cycles. A superior material is the core–shell structure
of Sn-Fe-3 sample, where the reversible capacity climbed to ∼600
mAh·g–1 by 40 cycles, having an even higher
capacity that initially at the 0.1 C lower current density. After
200 cycles, the capacity was still 541 mAh·g–1, corresponding to nearly 100% of the initial capacity (the sixth
cycle, for the first five cycles at 0.1 C) and ∼90.2% of the
highest charging capacity. The average capacity loss was only 0.049%
per cycle according to 90.2% retention ratio, and cycling efficiency
exceeded 99.5% for most of the cycles. Although it had the highest
initial capacity, the Sn-Fe-4 electrode, it gradually decayed. The
practical tap density of these four SnyFe nanostructure materials is between 1.6 and 1.7 g/cc, which was
much higher than that of graphite 0.8 g/cc. Therefore, the calculated
volumetric capacity of the core–shell anode, Sn-Fe-3, is close
to twice that of carbon (0.8 Ah/cc) after 200 cycles.

Figure 8 Cycling performance of
the samples at the C/2 rate is shown by
(a) gravimetric and (b) calculated volumetric capacity. Rate performance
of the samples is shown by (c) gravimetric capacity and (d) calculated
volumetric capacity.

The rate capability of these SnyFe
anodes was determined from 0.1 to 2 C and back to 0.1 C, and the results
are shown in Figure 8c,d. The corresponding charge and discharge curves in different current
rate are presented in Figure S3. Among
the four samples, the core–shell shows the best maintenance
of capacity after 90 cycles, and the highest rate capability except
at the 2C rate when the Sn-Fe-4 material was superior, but it did
not retain well the capacity when returned to low rates. The highest
tin content materials performed the worst on the rate test and did
not get back their full capacity when the rate was lowered. This is
expected from the capacity decay observed in Figure 8a. All four materials were removed for characterization
after the tests of Figure 8 and after Li removal to 1.5 V. Much of the crystallinity
had been lost, and Sn metal was observed in the Sn-Fe-1 and Sn-Fe-4
materials (see Figure S4); this suggests
that the superior performance of the intermediate composition is due
to the lack of the presence of tin metal.

3 Conclusions
The high gravimetric, 541 mAh/g after 200 cycles, and volumetric
capacity, superior rate capability, and reversibility of the SnyFe materials reported here suggest that an electrochemically
inactive element such as Fe is critical in maintaining the capacity
of the material. In addition, the capacity and capacity retention
can be increased by using a core–shell structure in which the
more reactive, in this case, the Sn5Fe, component is protected
by the lower less reactive Sn content material.

4 Experimental
Section
Tin (II) chloride (SnCl2, anhydrous, 99%),
iron (III)
chloride (FeCl3, anhydrous, 97%), poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP, MW=360 000), poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx, MW = 50 000),
tetraethylene glycol (TEG, 99%), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) were used as reaction chemicals. The SnyFe alloy nanoparticles were synthesized according
to the Chou et al. procedure.41 It was
carried out under an argon atmosphere via a Schlenk line. Typically,
2.1285 g of PVP and 0.9135 g of PEtOx were added into 50 mL of TEG
in a three-neck flask with vigorously stirring in 110 °C. After
PVP and PEtOx were dissolved, a SnCl2 solution (0.6 g of
SnCl2 in 6 mL of TEG) was injected and hold for 15 min.
The freshly prepared NaBH4 solution (0.5 g of NaBH4 in 25 mL of TEG) as a reducing agent was introduced drop
by drop. The color of the solution suddenly changed to black. It was
stirred at 110 °C for 25 min before the injection of FeCl3 solution (0.055 g of FeCl3 in 6 mL of TEG). After
45 min, the suspension was cooled down to room temperature. Changing
FeCl3 solution (0.11 g of FeCl3 in 6 mL of TEG,
0.22 g of FeCl3 in 6 mL of TEG, 0.275 g of FeCl3 in 6 mL of TEG), we obtained a series of samples with a molar ratio
between SnCl2 and FeCl3 from 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1,
to 2:1. SnyFe alloys in 170 °C were
also prepared under the same reagent molar ratio. All the samples
were washed four to five times using ethanol under sonication and
harvested by centrifugation with a speed of 12000 rad/min; no residual
B, C, or N was detected by EDS.

The structure of the samples
was characterized by X-ray diffraction
with a BRUKER diffractometer (D8 Advance) equipped with Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54178 Å), and data were collected over
a 2θ range of 10–90° with a step size of 0.02°
and a dwell time of 1 s. The Rietveld refinement of collected XRD
data was performed using software TOPAS-Academic V4.2. A Zeiss Supra
55 VP field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) operating
voltage of 5 kV and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM2100F)
with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector were applied
to detect the morphology of the samples. A structure of Fe–Sn
alloy nanoparticles was studied by selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) on a JEM2100F operated at 200 kV. EDX elemental line scanning
of Fe and Sn element was operated in an STEM mode. The molar ratio
of Sn to Fe (nSn/nFe) can be calculated as follows: nSn/nFe = (ISn × kSn × MFe)/(IFe × kFe × MSn), in which ISn and IFe are the
counts of the EDS signal collected during an STEM line scan, kSn and kFe are the k factor, and MSn and MFe are the atomic molar weights of the elements
Sn and Fe. For the TEM sample preparation process, the SnyFe powder was well dispersed in ethanol solvent with
vigorous sonication and then dropped it to a lacey carbon TEM grid,
which was dried and placed onto a Gavan holder. The tap density was
measured by a TD1 tap density tester.

The SnyFe nanoparticles were mixed
with carbon black and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, MW ∼
100,000) to form a slurry in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 with an appropriate
amount of distilled water solvent. The working electrode was prepared
by casting the slurry on a copper current collector using a doctor
blade and drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Then, it
was punched into an area of 1.2 cm2 with a loading weight
of 1.2 mg·cm–2. The 2325-type coin cells were
assembled in a Helium-filled glove box under ambient temperature with
the Celgard 2400 membrane as the separator and Li foil as a counter
and a reference electrode. LiPF6 (1.0 M) dissolved in ethylene
carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC, 1:1 in volume) with 10% flouroethylene
carbonate (FEC) as an additive was used as the electrolyte solution
to improve cycling stability. All galvanostatic charging/discharging
tests were obtained on a multichannel Biologic system with a voltage
range of 0.01–1.5 V at different current rate (1 C = 600 mA·g–1) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 0.005 and 1.5
V at a scan rate of 0.025 mV/s.
