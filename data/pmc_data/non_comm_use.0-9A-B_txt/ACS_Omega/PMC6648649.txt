To improve the dielectric performance
of polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF), BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites were prepared
by the solution casting method. The percolation threshold (fraction
of MWNTs) has dropped greatly below 0.4 vol %, with the enhancement
of dielectric constant and breakdown field. For the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15) composite, the dielectric constant
is 59, the loss is below 0.055, and the maximum operating electric
field is 324 MV/m, so the discharged energy density can be of up to
10.3 J/cm3 with the efficiency of above 77.2%. The reason
of improvement was revealed by the scanning electron microscope images
and the X-ray diffraction data. It is found that uniform distribution
of filler in the composites and the increase of the β phase
of polymers result in the enhancement of polarization and improvement
of dielectric constant of PVDF. The third-phase spherical inorganic
particles prevent the formation of conductive networks and improve
the uniformity of local electric field, so the breakdown strength
of composites can be enhanced greatly. Here, this paper provides a
method to get the composites with high energy storage density for
supercapacitors.

1 Introduction
Dielectric
capacitors with high discharged energy densities and
power densities are highly desired and have received tremendous attention
with the rapid development of compact, low-cost electronic, and electrical
power systems.1,2 Dielectric materials as capacitors
possess the abilities to obtain high discharged energy densities,3,4 which also exhibits high charge–discharge speeds (milliseconds
or microseconds) and almost infinite cycle life. In general, the discharged
energy storage density (Wrev) of dielectric
materials can be described by Wrev = ∫E dD, where E represents
the electric field and D represents the electric
displacement that positively relate to the dielectric constant (ε).5,6 It can be seen from this equation that large dielectric constant
and high breakdown field strength are required for high energy storage
densities. Although inorganic materials have large dielectric constants
and displacement polarization, the low electric breakdown strength
limits their further applications.7 Polymer-based
capacitors have become a hot spot in the capacitor industry because
of the superior performance, such as high breakdown strength, high
energy density, high power density, low loss, light weight, and self-healing
capability.8−10 However, the dielectric constant of polymeric materials
is generally low, leading to a lower energy density. For example,
biaxial-oriented polypropylene has an excellent breakdown strength
of up to 640 MV/m, but their too small dielectric constant (∼2)
leads to the unsatisfactory energy storage density (∼1.2 J/cm3).11,12 Therefore, a lot of works have
been focused on how to increase the dielectric constant of polymer
materials. At present, two main methods have been widely used to improve
dielectric constant by adding conductive particles (Ni, Zn, and Fe3O4)13,14 and high dielectric ceramic particles
(BaTiO3 and PbZrxTi1–xO3).15−17 For the high-dielectric
constant ceramic particle and polymer composites, the increase of
dielectric constant is limited even at higher content. For example,
the maximum dielectric constant of these polymer-based composites
can only reach 100 at the volume fraction of 50%. Moreover, these
composites at high fractions also have very serious limitations, such
as sharp declined flexibility and mechanical properties and increased
weight and density, restricting their further applications in the
electronic material field. Therefore, more and more researchers concentrate
on tailoring the dielectric performance of polymer-based composites
and maintaining their excellent flexibility simultaneously,18 because flexible polymer nanocomposites have
become one of the best candidates for various field applications.11,19 For the percolative composites based on the conductive particles
and polymers, the dielectric constant increases rapidly when the content
of the filled particles is close to the percolation threshold. It
overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings of ceramic and polymer composites
and enables a large increase in dielectric constant at lower volume
fractions. Based on the percolation theory, the dielectric constant
would rapidly increase when the system changed from insulators to
conductors near the percolation threshold, with the sharp increase
of dielectric loss at the same time.20,21 Generally
speaking, the percolation threshold is about 15–20% and the
filling of conductive particles also destroys the flexibility and
mechanical properties of the polymers.17 Moreover, the incompatibility between filler particles and polymer
matrixes also decreases the breakdown strength and greatly reduces
the ability of charge storing. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements
of electromechanical applications, it is necessary to reduce the percolation
threshold of conductive particles. Thus, how to achieve the percolation
transition at a low filling content is a key issue.

It has been
found that an effective conductive network can be formed
at a low content when low-dimensional nanoconductive particles are
used as the fillers in the dielectric composites.22 It can greatly reduce the percolation threshold, and the
flexibility and easy processing characteristics of polymers can be
maintained. It is reported that zero-dimension zinc oxide (ZnO), one-dimensional
carbon nanotube (CNT), and two-dimensional graphene nanosheet (GN)
have been added into the polymer to achieve percolation transition
at a lower fraction (ZnO-10 wt %,23 CNT-1.6
vol %20 and GN-2.5 wt %24), with great enhancement of dielectric constant. However,
the defects induced by the filled particles greatly reduced the breakdown
strengths of these composites. For example, the breakdown strength
of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes/polyvinylidene fluoride (MWNTs/PVDF)
composites drops below 100 MV/m.25 Meanwhile,
the agglomeration and uniform distribution of filled nanoparticles
in the polymer also leads to the declined breakdown strength.

In this paper, in order to improve the electric breakdown strength
of MWNTs/PVDF composites, a certain amount of third-phase spherical
inorganic particles (BaTiO3) were added to prevent the
formation of conductive networks and improve the uniformity of local
electric field strength. It was found that the breakdown strength
of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites could be enhanced
more than threefold to 324 MV/m. Meanwhile, the dielectric constant
was also improved greatly with the synergetic effect of high dielectric
particles and percolation effect. Therefore, a material with high
dielectric constant, high breakdown strength, and high energy storage
density can be obtained, which helps to open another method for supercapacitors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Microstructure of BaTiO3, MWNTs,
and Composites
Figure 1 displays the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
MWNT nanoparticles, BaTiO3 nanoparticles, and the freeze-fractured
BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites. It can be observed
from Figure 1a,b that
MWNTs are dispersed well after ultrasonic cell disruption, and the
average size of monodispersed BaTiO3 nanoparticles is about
20 nm. As shown in Figure 1c,d, the MWNT and BaTiO3 nanoparticles are uniformly
dispersed in the PVDF matrix, indicating that a homogeneous BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF composite can be obtained in this work.

Figure 2 shows
the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of PVDF and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(x/0.35/99.65 – x) at room
temperature. For the PVDF film, the peaks at 2θ = 18.4°
and 20.8° are the characteristic diffraction of (020) of the
nonpolar phase (α phase) and (110)/(200) of the polar phase
(β phase), respectively.

Figure 2 XRD spectrum of PVDF and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF composites.

Furthermore, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 21.9°,
31.3°,
38.6°, 44.9°, 50.6°, and 55.9° can be indexed
to (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), and (211) planes of BaTiO3 according to the standard PDF (no. #31-0174), respectively.
It is found that the relative ratio of α and β phases
decreases greatly with the increase of fraction of BaTiO3, as shown in Figure S1. The increase
of β phase and the decrease of α phase induce the enhancement
of polarization of PVDF. In addition, the diffraction peaks of MWNTs
cannot be observed in the XRD pattern because of the small content
and amorphous behavior of MWNTs.5,26

2.2 Dielectric
Properties of the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
The dielectric
constant (ε) and dielectric
loss (tan δ) of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) ternary composites at room
temperature are presented in Figure 3. It has been found that the MWNTs/PVDF binary composites
exhibit the typical percolative behaviors with the percolation threshold
of 0.4 vol % (shown in Figure S2). To control
the dielectric loss at a relative low level, here the volume of MWNTs
is fixed at 0.35 vol %, where the value of tan δ is below 0.05.
The ε in Figure 3a shows gradual decrease with frequency, whereas the tan δ
in Figure 3b exhibits
no change at low frequency and a broad peak at 106 Hz.
The Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars interfacial polarization
and space charge polarization could not catch up the switching fields,
resulting in the decrease of ε and the increase of tan δ
at higher frequency. To reveal the influence of BaTiO3 nanoparticles
on the dielectric properties, dependence of ε and tan δ
of both BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65
– x) and BaTiO3/PVDF (x/100 – x) composites on the fraction of BaTiO3 is presented in Figure 3c. Obviously, the ε increases with increasing
of the BaTiO3 volume fraction in these two types of composites.
However, the enhancement of dielectric constant of the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) is better than that of BaTiO3/PVDF (x/100 – x) at the same volume fraction of
BaTiO3. Furthermore, the superiority is becoming distinct
with the increase of the volume fraction.

Figure 3 Dependence of (a) dielectric
constant and (b) dielectric loss of
PVDF and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65
– x) composites on the frequency. (c) Dependence
of dielectric constant and loss of the BaTiO3/PVDF (x/100 – x) and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites at 100 Hz.

The ε of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) can be improved up to 60
when the fraction of BaTiO3 is 11.5 vol %. It is 6, 2.4,
and 2.7 times larger than that of PVDF, MWNTs/PVDF, and BaTiO3/PVDF, respectively. Here, the enhancement of dielectric constant
in the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF composites might be caused by
the following reasons: (1) the hydroxyl groups on the surface of self-synthesized
BaTiO3 can act as the surfactant and promote the compatibility
between the filled particles and PVDF matrix. (2) BaTiO3 themselves are the high ε particles which can significantly
improve the dielectric properties of the composites. (3) The increase
of the β phase of PVDF (discussed above) caused by the introduction
of BaTiO3 also helps to improve the dielectric constant
of composites. At the same time, the dielectric loss of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF composites shows no obvious change and is successfully
kept at a low level. For instance, the dielectric loss is below 0.075
at 100 Hz when the fraction of BaTiO3 is 16.5 vol %, which
implies small leakage current and low energy loss of the composites.27

2.3 Energy Storage Behavior
of the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
The measured polarization
versus electric field
(P–E) hysteresis loops at
different electric fields are shown in Figure 4a. All loops show linear response at low
field and exhibit nonlinear ferroelectric hysteresis at high field,
which is the characteristic of ferroelectrics. Although the breakdown
strength decreases gradually with the increasing filler, the corresponding
polarization of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF composites increases.
The polarization reaches the maximum (7.6 μC/cm2)
when the fraction of BaTiO3 is 11.5 vol %, which is 2 times
higher than that of BaTiO3/PVDF binary composites (shown
in Figure S3), indicating that the MWNTs
have great effects on the polarization of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites.
Meanwhile, as shown in Figure S4a, the P–E hysteresis loops of MWNTs/PVDF
exhibit a large leakage behavior and show very low breakdown field
because of the formation of the conduction path of MWNTs. Considering
all results above, the filled MWNTs and BaTiO3 play a dominant
role in the polarization behavior of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites.

Figure 4 (a) P–E hysteresis loops;
(b) the Pmax – Pr values; (c) Weibull distribution of breakdown strength;
and (d) leakage current of PVDF and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF composites.

It has been generally accepted
that Pmax – Pr values and electric breakdown
strength are the two key factors to affect the energy storage performance
of composites. Along this line, the Pmax – Pr values versus the electric
field for PVDF and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites are presented
in the Figure 4b. It
can be observed that Pmax – Pr value increases with the increasing BaTiO3 content which should be beneficial in achieving excellent
energy storage density.6,28 The breakdown electric fields
of ferroelectrics are found to follow Weibull distributions and the
average dielectric strength can be determined from the variation between
different tests29 1   2   3  where Xi and Yi are two
parameters in the Weibull distribution function, Ei is the breakdown field in each test, n is the number of tests, and i is the
serial number. The breakdown fields increase in the order of E1 ≤ E2 ≤
... ≤ Ei ≤
... ≤ En. Through
the linear fitting of Yi(Xi) curves, the Weibull
modulus γ and average dielectric strength Eb were obtained where γ is the slope and Eb is Xi at Yi = 0. The
Weibull plots of the breakdown field for BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites
at room temperature are illustrated in Figure 4c. It can be found that the breakdown strength
decreases significantly with the increase of BaTiO3 content.
The defects and voids induced by the filled BaTiO3, lead
to the heterogeneous distribution of electric field.29 By the way, although the breakdown strength of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites decreases with the increase of BaTiO3 content, the breakdown strength of the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(11.5/0.35/88.15) composite can be of upto 324 MV/m, which is greatly
higher than that of the 0.35MWNTs/PVDF composite (Figure S4, 30 MV/m). Here the barrier characteristic of BaTiO3 might be realized because of the steric effect, which avoids
the premature agglomeration of fillers and leads to improvement of
breakdown strength.30,31

Additionally, the leakage
current, which is sensitive to the defects
and grain boundaries, has great effect on the electric breakdown strength.
Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of BaTiO3 content on the leakage current behaviors of nanocomposites
for optimizing the electric breakdown strength. As shown in Figure 4d, the leakage current
densities of PVDF and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites are in the range
of 10–7 to 10–5 A/cm2 and follow a reasonable increasing trend with the rise of applied
electric field.

Although the leakage current densities of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
composites gradually increase with the increasing BaTiO3 content caused by the defects and space charges, it remains much
lower than that of MWNTs/PVDF composites (Figure S4b) because of the existence of conduction barrier induced
by BaTiO3.6,32 The energy densities are calculated
from the P–E loops and shown
in Figure 5a. It can
be obviously found that BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) composites exhibit significantly
higher energy density than that of the PVDF film. The maximum energy
density obtained in the film with 11.5 vol % BaTiO3 nanoparticles
is 10.3 J/cm3 at 324 MV/m, which is two times larger than
that of the PVDF film (5.3 J/cm3 at 411 MV/m). As discussed
above, the energy density is determined by the Pmax – Pr and electric breakdown
values, therefore, the enhancement of the energy density of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15) composites is because of the
following aspects:(1) The introduction of surface-modified
BaTiO3 not only increases the polarization (dielectric
constant) of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65
– x) composites, but also provides a conduction
barrier for the breakdown path. In this case, their polarization increases
while breakdown strength decreases with the increasing BaTiO3 content. When the content of BaTiO3 reaches 11.5 vol
%, the synergetic optimization effect of polarization and breakdown
strength leads to the highest energy density of 10.3 J/cm3.

(2) A large amount of
electric charge
can be enriched under the electric field at the interfaces between
MWNTs and PVDF also improve the polarization of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(11.5/0.35/88.15) composites.33,34

(3) The increase of polar phase (β
phase) could also help to increase the polarization of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15) composites. For practical applications
of dielectric capacitors, the high field efficiency (η) is another
key factor to characterize the energy storage performance of dielectric
materials. As shown in Figure 5b, the efficiency decreases with the increasing BaTiO3 content because of the fatted hysteresis loops. It can be
seen that the efficiency of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15)
composites is 77.2%, indicating these composites have great potential
in applications of energy storage.5

of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15) composites at 245
MV/m (75%
of the maximum breakdown field strength) with different temperatures.
It can be seen that the hysteresis of the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF
(11.5/0.35/88.15) composite gets thicker and wider with the increase
of temperature. The corresponding energy storage performances of BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15) composites at different temperatures
are shown in Figure 6b. When the temperature reaches 80 °C, the energy density and
efficiency remain about 7.5 J/cm3 and 70%, respectively.
It indicates that the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (11.5/0.35/88.15)
composites has a wide range of temperature applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites with
excellent dielectric and energy storage performance were prepared.
The dispersion of MWNTs in the composites can be greatly improved
by cell disruption, leading to the reduction of percolation threshold.
Additionally, the second filler (BaTiO3) not only further
improves the dispersion of MWNTs, but also increases the dielectric
performance without consuming the electric field strength, and thus
an enhanced energy storage density can be obtained.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Materials
MWNTs—the
average
diameter and length of MWNTs are about 20 nm and 2–5 μm,
respectively.26 Triethylene glycol (TEG), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and Ba(OH)2·8H2O (AR 98%, Aladdin Industrial Corporation,
China), Ti(OC4H9)4 (AR 99.0%, Aladdin
Industrial Corporation, China), and PVDF (3F Corporation, Shanghai,
China). All chemicals were of analytical grade and directly used without
further purification.

4.2 Preparation of BaTiO3 Nanoparticles
Highly stable BaTiO3 nanoparticles
of about 20 nm were
synthesized via controlling hydrolysis of Ti(OC4H9)4 in alcohols. Ba(OH)2·8H2O (1.8 M), Ti(OC4H9)4 (1.5 M), and
polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, K30) (34.8 mg/mL) were added to the TEG
solvents. The mixture was then gradually heated to 160 °C with
stirring by a magnetic agitator for 2 h. After cooling, deionized
water was employed to remove the attached TEG on the BaTiO3 surface and precipitate the sols. Subsequently, the as-prepared
BaTiO3 nanoparticles were washed about six times with ethanol
and deionized water through a high-speed centrifugation and then dried
in 80 °C for 12 h. Additionally, the surface of BaTiO3 synthesized via this method already has −OH groups, and thus
further functionalization process is not required.9

4.3 Preparation of MWNTs/PVDF
and BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF Composites
In order to decrease
the agglomeration
of MWNTs and reduce the percolation threshold of MWNTs in MWNTs/PVDF,
MWNTs were first treated by the cell disruption technology. In this
study, the content of MWNTs was fixed at 0.35 vol % (detail discussion
can be found in Figure S2). After this,
BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites with different BaTiO3 contents BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF (x/0.35/99.65 – x) were prepared by solution
casting through the following process.

First, the powders of
PVDF were fully dissolved in DMF solution, followed by the dispersion
of MWNTs and BaTiO3 powders. Then, the mixed solution was
thoroughly blended under an ultrasonication for 0.5 h using a cell
crusher, and then blended for 24 h by magnetic stirring. Subsequently,
the solution was slowly dropped onto conductive glasses, and then
the samples were transferred into a vacuum oven and heated at 200
°C for 0.5 h. By controlling the concentration and volume of
the solution, the film thickness can be controlled at 10–15
μm. The final volume of BaTiO3 in the BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites varied from 3 to 16.5 vol %. For comparison,
the 0.35vol%MWNTs/PVDF and BaTiO3/PVDF (x/100 – x) binary composites were also prepared.

5 Characterization
The morphologies of the
MWNTs, BaTiO3 particles, and
BaTiO3/MWNTs/PVDF ternary composites were investigated
through a scanning electron microscope (SU-70, Hitachi). The phase
structures of samples were performed on an X-ray diffractometer (D8
ADVANCE, Bruker). Before the electric properties measurement, top
gold electrodes with a size of 0.016 cm2 were deposited
by a 108-Auto sputter coater (Cressington Scientific Instruments,
UK). The dielectric performances of samples were measured by the Agilent
precision impedance analyzer 4294A at room temperature. The P–E hysteresis loops were obtained
on a Premier II ferroelectric material test system (Radiant Technologies,
USA).
