Electrically driven steam generation
is a critical process for
many heating-related applications such as sterilization and food processing.
Current systems, which rely on heating up the bulk water to generate
steam, face the dilemma in achieving a large evaporation flux and
fast thermal response. Herein, we report a self-floating electrically
driven interfacial evaporator for fast high-efficiency steam generation
independent of the amount of loaded bulk water in the system. Through
localized heating of the wicked water at the air–water interface,
the evaporator has achieved an electrical-to-steam energy conversion
efficiency of ∼90% at a heating power density of 10 kW/m2 and a fast thermal response of 20 s. The interfacial evaporation
design not only achieves a high evaporation efficiency within a broad
range of heating power densities by using different wicking materials,
but also enables attaining a high evaporation temperature under low
heating power densities by tuning the ratio of the vapor outlet area
and the evaporation surface area. By integrating an interfacial evaporator
within a sanitizer, the resultant system has demonstrated a faster
steam temperature rise and superior steam sterilization performance
than the commercial bulk heating-based approach.

Introduction
Steam has played a
vital role in advancing technology development
of human society since the invention of steam engine in the industrial
revolution.1 Even now, steam is widely
used to propel gas turbines to generate electricity in power plants.2 In daily human life, steam is most often known
for its household usage in cooking,3 sterilization,4 humidification,5 cleaning,6 drying,7 and many
other heating-related applications.8 For
example, a sterilizer that uses hot steam to decontaminate baby bottles
and toys has become an indispensable appliance for almost every family
with children. In a typical sterilization process, a pot of water
needs to be intensively heated by an electric heating element until
reaching the boiling point to generate the steam. It often takes quite
a while before the system can generate hot steam and the thermal response
of the steam generation system is strongly dependent on the amount
of loaded water. The bulk water heating also causes inevitable heat
losses and thereby lowers the energy conversion efficiency of the
system. Therefore, bulk heating-based evaporation systems are not
well suited for steam sterilization applications, where instant generation
of large-flux hot steam is desired.9,10

In recent
years, interfacial evaporation that relies on localized
heating at the air–water interface has emerged as a superior
way for steam generation.11−14 The localized heating design suppressed the heat
losses and thereby helped improving energy conversion efficiency without
complex thermal insulation engineering, and the reduced thermal mass
helped achieve a fast thermal response of the evaporation system.11 Previous research efforts were focused on solar
steam generation,15−21 which utilizes solar-absorbing materials to convert sunlight into
heat to drive water evaporation. Although great progress in improving
evaporation performance22−28 and exploration of steam sterilization applications29,30 have been made, generation of hot steam often requires concentrated
solar fluxes, which involves the usage of expensive optical concentrators.
While a new system design has enabled steam generation under one-sun
illumination,31−33 the achieved solar-to-steam conversion efficiency
is much lower. Additionally, the intermittent, diffuse, and weather-dependent
nature of sunlight prevents the application of the solar steam generator
for indoor sterilization at night or during cloudy days.34−36 By comparison, the steam generator powered by electricity, which
can be converted through photovoltaic technology from the Sun or other
renewable energy sources, would be a more practical solution.37−39

Herein, we report an electrically driven interfacial evaporation
system for high-efficiency steam generation and household portable
sterilization applications. As shown in Figure 1, the evaporation structure consists of a
water-wicking membrane on the top, an electrical heater in the middle,
and a self-floating thermal insulator at the bottom. The floating
insulator suppresses the downward heat losses and helps localizing
the Joule heating to the wicked water. The localized interfacial electrical-heating
(LIEH) evaporation system has shown a fast response time for steam
generation within 20 s and achieved a high electrical-to-steam energy
conversion efficiency of ∼90% at a heating power density of
10 kW/m2. We further demonstrate that the interfacial evaporation
structure allows for the facile tuning of the evaporation efficiency
and vapor temperature, and enables high-efficiency steam generation
under a broad range of heating power densities. The efficient and
fast-response LIEH-based steam generator can be readily integrated
within a commercial sanitizer for rapid and effective sterilization
under low-heating power densities.

steam generation and portable steam sterilization. Schematic structure

electrical heater, and a silicone foam-based floating thermal insulator.

Results and Discussion
A hydrophilic
air-laid paper was used as the water-wicking membrane
and placed on top of the electrical heater to pump water from beneath
for continuous evaporation (Figure 2a). Its porous structure allows the generated vapor
to permeate from the top surface. Compared with normal tissues or
wet-laid paper, air-laid paper is flexible and durable,40,41 and thus is used as the wicking material. To characterize the water-wicking
performance, air-laid paper was placed in direct contact with a red-colored
dye solution. As shown in Figure 2b, air-laid paper was quickly wetted by the dye solution
with a sorption rate of 0.11 kg/h, and fully wetted paper could store
0.482 kg/m2 of water. Such a quick water sorption rate
ensures sufficient water supply during the evaporation process.

Photograph of a plasma-treated hydrophilic hot electrical heater with
few bubbles. The inset shows a water contact angle of 10° on
the plasma-treated heater surface. The heater was electrically heated
at 10 kW/m2 for 30 min.

To keep the evaporator floating at the interface, thermally stable
porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam was used as the floater and
thermal insulator. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 2c presents that closed
pores with an average diameter of ∼150 μm are uniformly
distributed within the silicone matrix. Thermal conductivity measurement
in our previous work34,40 indicates that silicone foam
has a low thermal conductivity of ∼0.03 W/m K so it can effectively
suppress the downward heat leakage and localize Joule heating at the
evaporative interface. Compared to polystyrene foam,28 carbon foam,13 and carbonized
wood20 thermal insulators that had been
used in solar-driven evaporation systems,11 here silicone foam has the combined advantages of good thermal stability,
low thermal conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and biomedical compatibility.
These features are desired for fast-response, high-efficiency hot
steam generation under high heating power densities for medical sanitization
and sterilization applications. Commercial polyimide-sealed Fe–Cr–Al
thin-film electrical heating plates were employed as the heater to
provide Joule heating and drive the evaporation due to its high electric-to-heat
conversion efficiency (∼99%, Note S1). Figure 2d displays
that the as-received heater is hydrophobic with a water contact angle
of 90° and many bubbles are formed on the hot surface of the
heater when it was immersed within water. After surface plasma treatment,
the heater became hydrophilic showing a water contact angle of 10°
and very few bubbles were observed (Figure 2e). Considering the intimate contact between
the hydrophilic water-wicking layer and the hydrophilic heater, we
chose the plasma-treated hydrophilic heater in the evaporation system.

The evaporation test was performed by recording the real-time mass
change of the evaporation system with an analytical balance. The evaporation
experiment was carried out on an open water body without complicated
thermal insulation. We comparatively studied the evaporation performance
of three different systems: evaporation driven by bottom electrical
heating (BEH), interfacial electrical heating (IEH) that only has
the electrical heater at the air–liquid interface, and LIEH
(Figure S1). Figure 3a shows that under the same input heating
power density of 10 kW/m2 the LIEH system has achieved
an evaporation mass loss of 7.27 kg/m2 within 30 min, which
is much larger than that in the BEH system (0.92 kg/m2)
and IEH (3.35 kg/m2) systems. Another observation is that
the evaporation mass loss linearly increases with the heating time
for the LIEH system while the mass change gradually increases in the
other two systems. The obvious difference in evaporation rates is
clearly demonstrated in Figure 3b. The LIEH evaporation system has reached a steady evaporation
rate of ∼14.53 kg/m2 h within 50 s. By contrast,
the evaporation rate for BEH and IEH systems continuously increases
during the whole heating period meaning that they did not arrive at
the steady state. The fast response of the LIEH evaporation system
was further demonstrated by periodically switching on and switching
off the heater, which shows a stepwise mass change with a response
time as short as ∼20 s (Figure S2).

evaporation mass loss for three different evaporation systems under
a heating power density of 10 kW/m2. (b) Evolution of evaporation
rates. (c) Comparison of evaporation efficiency under different heating
power densities. (d) Temperature evolution profiles at the air–water
interface and the bottom of the container under a heating power density
of 10 kW/m2.

The evaporation efficiency
(η) was calculated by η
= ṁhLV/qelectrical, where ṁ is
the average mass change rate per unit area over the evaporation period
(1800 s), hLV is the evaporation enthalpy
of water that contains both liquid-to-vapor phase change enthalpy
and sensible heat, and qelectrical is
the input electrical power density, which can be tuned by changing
the applied power onto the electrical heater. Figure 3c shows that the LIEH system has a much higher
evaporation efficiency than the IEH and BEH systems within the tested
heating power densities. The low evaporation efficiency for the IEH
and BEH systems could be understood from the fact that most of the
input thermal energy is used for sensible heating of bulk water rather
than driving the evaporation. Because of the large thermal mass and
serious heat loss, the time to reach a steady evaporation state of
the IEH and BEH systems is much longer than the LIEH system. The evaporation
efficiency of the LIEH evaporator reached the highest evaporation
efficiency of ∼90% under a heating power density of 10 kW/m2 and further increasing heat power density leads to dropped
efficiency (Figure 3c). The decreased efficiency is related to the changed evaporation
mode from thin-film evaporation to boiling, which generates large
bubble and increases the convective heat losses in the LIEH system.
By establishing a COMSOL model (Note S2), we simulated the temperature distribution of the evaporation system,
which confirms the overheating of the LIEH evaporator above 100 °C
when the power density increases from 10 to 12 kW/m2 (Figure S3). Based on the simulated surface temperature
of the evaporator under different heating densities, we quantitatively
estimated the heat losses and the evaporation efficiency for the IEH
and LIEH evaporation systems (Note S3).
Four types of heat losses are identified for the LIEH evaporation
system, namely, convection loss, radiation loss, downward conduction
loss to silicone foam, and sensible heating of the water-wicking layer.
The calculation shows that the percentage of heat losses with respect
to the input heating power decreases as the power density increases
from 2 to 10 kW/m2, which explains the increasing evaporation
efficiency in this range. When the heating power density increases
to 12 kW/m2, the percentage of convection heat loss increases
from 4 to 8% because of the increased heat transfer coefficient under
boiling. In the IEH evaporation system, the major heat loss comes
from the download heat leakage toward the bulk water body due to the
lack of the floating thermal insulator. By deducting various forms
of heat losses in the system from the heating input, the calculated
evaporation efficiency profiles are in good agreement with the experimentally
measured results (Figure S4).

The
lost heat is also reflected in a temperature distribution difference
among three evaporation systems. Figure 3d shows that the LIEH evaporator has achieved
the highest interfacial temperature of ∼81 °C and the
lowest bottom temperature of ∼24 °C. In the LIEH system,
the bottom temperature of the floating insulator remains the same
temperature with the surrounding environment implying that almost
no heat is leaked from the evaporation surface to the bulk water during
the evaporation process. On the other hand, the IEH system could not
reach the high temperature as the LIEH system because part of heat
is leaked into the bulk water. As shown by the higher bottom temperature
than the interfacial temperature, the electrical heating in the BEH
system mainly causes the increase of the bottom water temperature,
and the low temperature at the air–water interface limits vapor
generation. It was noted that the evaporation rate profiles in Figure 3b and the interfacial
temperature curves in Figure 3d showed similar trends. This is because the evaporation rate
has a strong positive relation with the evaporation temperature based
on the Langmuir evaporation equation.42 It should be noted that although the evaporation temperature, which
was measured by the thermocouple in direct contact with the water-wicking
layer, was lower than 100 °C, COMSOL simulation indicates that
the temperature at the surface of the electrical heater has reached
100 °C. This implies that steam was generated at a heating power
density of 10 kW/m2, but it was quickly cooled down when
the steam enters into the air.26,28

To achieve high
evaporation efficiency under the broad range of
heating power densities, we further investigated the usage of filter
paper (with a thickness of 155 μm) and hemp paper (with a thickness
of 303 μm) as the water-wicking layer in addition to the air-laid
paper (with a thickness of 222 μm) (Figure S5). The SEM images in Figure 4a show that the filter paper has a semi-permeable structure
composed of tightly weaved fibers and only a few pores with a diameter
of ∼10 μm are left. The cellulose fibers in air-laid
paper are randomly distributed rendering good breathability of water
vapor. Hemp fabric weaved by thick fibers that consist of many fine
fibers, and large pores (∼100 μm) are observed. The corresponding
three-dimensional (3D) microscopy images in Figure 4b show that filter paper has the smallest
thickness variation while the holes in the hemp fabric are thoroughly
penetrated. Figure 4c presents that the filter-paper-based evaporation system has a highest
evaporation efficiency of ∼80% under a low power density of
2 kW/m2 and the efficiency continuously decreases with
increasing heating power density. The high evaporation efficiency
observed in the filter-paper-based system under 2 kW/m2 is attributed to the fact that filter paper has the lowest amount
of absorbed water (∼0.6 g), thus the evaporation surface could
reach a higher temperature. However, filter paper has a small vapor
permeability of 1.33 g/m2 s, which is between the evaporation
rate of the evaporator under heating powers of 2 kW (0.78 g/m2s) and 4 kW (1.47 g/m2 s). When the evaporation
rate is larger than the vapor permeability of water-wicking membranes,
the escape of vapor is impeded. Therefore, under higher heating power
densities, the small shallow pores in filter paper impede the escape
of vapor, which in turn tends to cause overheating and serious heat
losses. The hemp fabric-based evaporation system has shown an opposite
trend and has achieved the largest efficiency of ∼85% at 12
kW/m2. The larger amount of wicked water within the hemp
fabric wicking layer (∼1.0 g) restricts the rise of the evaporation
surface temperature, which suppresses the evaporation efficiency at
low heating power densities. On the other hand, the large deep holes
facilitate the release of vapor bubbles through the hemp fabric and
ensure stable evaporation under high heating power densities.

membranes: filter paper (left), air-laid paper (middle), and hemp

fabric (right). (c) Evaporation efficiency of the LIEH-based evaporator

of the air-paper evaporator with different top-surface coverages.

Vapor temperature is another important performance
indicator for
the evaporation system. To tune the evaporation temperature, we covered
the air-laid paper evaporation surface with a silicone film (2 mm
thick) punched with holes (Figure S6).
By varying the ratio of the vapor outlet area to the evaporation surface
area (σ = Aoutlet/Aevaporation), we comparatively measured the steady-state
evaporation temperature. The punched cover reduces the evaporation
area and the evaporation mass flow, thus the same Joule heating input
can induce a higher evaporation temperature. Additionally, the coverage
of the air-laid paper wicking layer decreases the convection heat
loss from the evaporation surface, which can also help increase the
evaporation temperature. Figure 4d confirms that the punched cover indeed boosts the
evaporation temperature and the cover with a smaller σ shows
stronger enhancement. When the electrical heating power density is
6 kW/m2, the evaporation temperature could be continuously
increased from ∼70 to ∼100 °C by using the punched
cover with a decreasing σ from 1 to 0.01. By contrast, without
the coverage of the punched cover the evaporation temperature only
reached ∼85 °C even when the heating power density was
doubled to 12 kW/m2. Such a strategy enables the generation
of hot steam under ambient pressure with low heating power densities.

It should be noted that the fast response and high electrical-to-vapor
conversion efficiency of the evaporator are from the unique localized
interfacial heating design. Besides the demonstrated flat 2D heaters,
such an evaporator can be driven by 1D and 3D heaters as well. In
previous solar-driven evaporation systems, it has been demonstrated
that the evaporator constructed by folded three-dimensional absorbers
can further improve the evaporation flux and evaporation efficiency
than the two-dimensional flat absorbers.43,44 Compared with the solar-driven evaporators, the configuration of
heating sources can be more versatile in electrically driven interfacial
evaporation systems. By connecting the thin film heater with a 3D
metallic heat sink (Figure S7), we investigated
the evaporation performance of the pin fin-structured evaporator.
The evaporation efficiency of such a system was determined to be 66.4,
69.8, and 72.7% under the heating powers of 5, 10, and 15 W, respectively.
Compared to the flat configuration, the evaporation efficiency is
slightly decreased in the pin fin-structured evaporator, which could
be related to the large thermal mass of the pin fin metallic heat
sink. In this case, a portion of Joule heating was consumed to heat
up the heat sink. However, unlike the flat configuration that leads
to overheating and decreased evaporation efficiency under a high heating
power, the evaporation efficiency of the pin fin-structured evaporator
continuously increases with the tested heating power. The enlarged
evaporation surface areas from the three-dimensional pin fin evaporation
structure is beneficial for achieving large evaporation fluxes without
causing overheating problems, which usually occur in the evaporators
with a flat configuration under high heat power conditions. It should
be noted that the pin fin structure is only one implementation for
the 3D evaporator design and there are other possible ways for improving
the evaporation performance. For example, the recovery of evaporation
latent heat is another effective approach to boost the evaporation
flux, which has been demonstrated in multistage solar-thermal desalination
devices.45

We proceeded to employ
the high-efficiency LIEH-based evaporator
for fast steam generation within closed systems. In this case, the
evaporator (5 cm in diameter) was placed within a cylindrical polystyrene
vessel with a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 10 cm. Figure 5a presents that the LIEH-based
evaporator successfully generated steam at 100 °C under a heating
power density of 18 kW/m2 within 2 min, while it takes
∼10 min for the BEH-based system to generate steam. We further
demonstrated that such a fast-responsive advantage is almost independent
of the amount of bulk water loaded in the evaporation system. We compared
the time for the evaporation system to generate 100 °C steam
when it is loaded with three different volumes of water (50, 100,
and 200 mL). Figure 5b presents that the required heating time for the LIEH-based evaporator
to generate steam under a fixed heating power density is almost the
same, but the steam generation process for the BEH-based evaporator
is much slower and is strongly dependent on the amount of loaded water
in the system. This difference can be understood from the fact that
the LIEH-based evaporator only heats up the amount of water stored
within the wicking layer, which is almost independent of the water
body beneath, whereas the BEH-based evaporator needs to heat up the
bulk water body in order to generate steam. We also carried out theoretical
analyses on the response time for the generation of 100 °C steam
in both the BEH-based and LIEH-based steam generator (Note S4). In the BEH-based system, the response
time is inversely proportional to the heating power density, and the
proportionality is mainly determined by the mass of loaded water (Figure 5b). This means that
the bulk heating-based steam sterilization faces the dilemma of achieving
large evaporation masses, which is determined by the amount of loaded
water, and the fast thermal response in steam generation. In contrast,
the response time of the LIEH-based evaporation system is independent
of the amount of loaded water as evidenced by the overlapped profiles.
Compared to the experimentally measured results, the slight underestimation
of the required thermal response time is due to the neglected heat
losses from the evaporation system during the theoretical modeling.

To test the steam sterilization performance, the LIEH-based evaporator
was placed within a commercial steam sanitizer containing 50 mL of
water. Two thermocouples were utilized to monitor the temperature
evolution of the generated steam. One is located at 1 cm above the
evaporation interface (Tinterface) and
the other is located at the top surface of the sterilization chamber
(Ttop). As shown in Figure 5c, the Tinterface immediately increased and reached a steady temperature close to
100 °C within 5 min under the heating power of 18 kW/m2, and the Ttop profile showed a similar
quick rise and reached a stabilized temperature at ∼90 °C
due to heat dissipation from the cover surface. Under the same heating
conditions, the evaporation temperature rise in the BEH-based system
was much slower. The Tinterface and the Ttop only reached 85 and 64 °C after heating
for 15 min, respectively. The Escherichia coli bacteria were used as the indicator in the steam sterilization experiments.46 The sterile tubes containing the bacterial solution
were exposed to hot steam within the sanitizer for 15 min under a
heating power density of 18 kW/m2 (Figure S8). Figure 5d presents that all the E. coli bacterial cells were killed by the LIEH-based steam sanitizer, but
many bacteria cells were still alive after treatment in the BEH-based
steam sanitizer due to the low vapor temperature. The high evaporation
temperature and large evaporation flux achieved in the LIEH-based
steam sterilization enable rapid effective sterilization under a low
electrical heating supply.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated
a localized heating-based electrically
driven interfacial evaporator as an alternative to conventional bulk
heating-based evaporation systems for high-efficiency steam generation
and fast-responsive steam sterilization. The unique interfacial evaporation
system design enables achieving high evaporation efficiency under
a broad range of heating power densities and facile tuning of the
evaporation temperature by varying the ratio of the vapor outlet area
to the evaporation surface area. The resultant floating evaporator
is capable of rapidly generating high-temperature steam under low-heating
power densities, and the steam generation rate is independent of the
amount of loaded bulk water. Besides the demonstrated fast steam sterilization
application, it is anticipated that the reported evaporator could
be integrated with other systems to explore high-performance cooking,
steam cleaning, humidification, and other vapor or steam-enabled applications.
In addition, the electrically driven interfacial evaporators can make
use of the electricity converted by the photovoltaic systems during
daytime to continuously drive the evaporation at night or under cloudy
weather conditions. Thus, they can be a complementary system to the
widely explored solar-driven interfacial evaporators that operate
in situ only during daytime.

agent were supplied by Bluestar Silicones Co., Ltd (Shanghai). The
two-component silicone elastomer (Sylgard 184) was purchased from
Dow Corning. The polyimide-sealed film heater was purchased from Shanghai
Songdao Heater Co., Ltd. Air-laid paper was purchased from Dongguan
Jia Chong Purification Technology Co., Ltd. Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and nutrient agar plates were purchased from
Shanghai Luwei Microbial Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd.

Fabrication
of Evaporator
The LIEH-based evaporator
consists of a piece of water-wicking air-laid paper, a hydrophilic
polyimide-sealed electrical heater, and silicone foam, which are stacked
together. The as-received polyimide-sealed film heater (1.25 cm in
radius) was treated within a plasma cleaner (PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma)
for 30 s to convert the surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. A
typical silicone thermal insulation foam was prepared by mixing 2
g of PDMS precursor and 2 g of foaming agent into a uniform mixture
within a Petri dish (1.75 cm in radius). The obtained mixture was
left at room temperature for 1 h for foam formation. Afterward, PDMS
foam was placed within an oven at 60 °C for 12 h to complete
the foam formation process. The silicone cover film was prepared by
mixing 2 g of silicone elastomer (Sylgard 184, part A) and 0.2 g of
curing agent (Sylgard 184, part B) within a Petri dish and curing
at 120 °C for 30 min. The cover films with different numbers
of holes were prepared through mechanical punching.

Characterization
and Property Measurement
The microstructure
of different water-wicking membranes was observed by a SEM (JSM-7800F
Prime, JEOL). The thickness of different water-wicking membranes was
measured by a micrometer (SYNTEK, China). The water contact angle
of the polyimide-sealed electrical heaters was measured by a contact
angle analyzer (DSA-100, Kruss). The electric-to-heat conversion efficiency
of the electrical heaters was measured by heating water in an insulated
glass container (Figure S9). A 3D optical
microscopy (Keyence VHX-S50) was used to characterize the surface
microstructure and the distribution of pores within different water-wicking
membranes. To characterize the water-wicking rate, one side of the
rectangle-shaped sample (2 cm × 4 cm) was placed in contact with
a red water-dye solution and the mass change of the sample was monitored.
The water absorption capacity was evaluated by immersing the membranes
in water and measuring the mass change.

Electrically Driven Evaporation
Experiment
In a typical
evaporation experiment, an electrical heater was connected to a dc
digital-control power supply (KA3005D, KORAD) with tunable heating
power densities. The mass of evaporated water was measured by an analytical
balance (BSM-220, Shanghai Zhuo Jing Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.).
Natural evaporation weight loss was measured and was deducted when
evaluating the evaporation efficiency of different evaporation systems.
The temperature evolution of the evaporation system was measured by
K-type thermocouples (TT-K, Omega Engineering Inc.), which were connected
with a data collector (34972A LXI Data Acquisition/Switch Unit, Agilent).
The evaporation temperature was measured by placing the thermocouple
in contact with a water-wicking layer.

Steam Sterilization Experiment
In steam sterilization
experiments, the evaporators (6 cm in diameter) were integrated in
a commercial steam sanitizer (Jin Zhi Ai LS-B321, Lonsun Electrical
Appliance Co., Ltd, China). One thermocouple was placed at a distance
of 1 cm from the evaporation surface to measure the generated steam
temperature, and another thermocouple was attached to the inner surface
of the top cover to monitor the temperature of the sterilization chamber.
In each sterilization experiment, 1 mL of E. coli bacteria-suspended solution was stored in a 3 mL of sterile centrifuge
tube, and the centrifuge tube was mounted on a plastic rack within
the sterilizer. The centrifuge tubes were sealed by a piece of the
breathable film to allow steam penetration and prevent contamination.
The sample was sterilized under an input heating power density of
18 kW/m2. After heating for 15 min, 100 μL of bacterial
solution was extracted out and spread onto the agar plates, which
were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The sterilization performance
of different evaporation systems was evaluated by counting the number
of bacterial cells alive on the agar plates after cultivation. As
a comparison, the as-received bacterial solution was diluted by 105-fold and the number of cultivated cells was counted by the
same method.
