Radiation-induced intestinal injury
is a common complication of
abdominal radiation therapy. However, the pathological features of
radiation-induced intestinal injury and its therapeutic regimen are
not very clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects
of antibiotic pretreatment on radiation-induced intestinal injury.
Abdominal radiation disrupted the intestinal microbiota balance and
significantly reduced bacterial diversity in mice. Antibiotic cocktail
(Abx) pretreatment effectively removed the intestinal microbiota of
mice, and metronidazole also reduced the diversity of intestinal bacteria
to some extent. Two antibiotic pretreatment regimens improved the
reconstitution ability of the gut microbiota in mice after radiation.
Further experiments showed that Abx pretreatment effectively reduced
the content of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inhibited the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
signaling pathway in the ileum. In addition, Abx pretreatment regulated
macrophage cell polarization in the ileum, downregulated TGF-β1,
phosphorylated Smad-3 and α-SMA protein levels, and upregulated
E-cadherin protein expression. Eventually, Abx pretreatment significantly
improved the survival rate and attenuated intestinal injury of mice
after radiation by reducing inflammation and preventing intestinal
fibrosis. These results revealed that antibiotic pretreatment can
effectively alleviate gut microbiota turbulence and intestinal damage
caused by abdominal radiation in mice. Collectively, these findings
add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of radiation enteritis.

==== Body
Introduction
Radiation therapy has
been an important treatment for cancer patients
in the past few decades. Despite advances in radiation technology,
collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissues remains a major complication
of radiation therapy. Abdominal radiotherapy will cause acute and
chronic damage to the intestine, manifested as radiation-induced intestinal
damage, clinically known as radiation enteropathy.1,2 Although
the mortality and prevalence associated with radiation-induced intestinal
damage have been valued, the understanding of its pathophysiology
and treatment options remains incomplete.3

Studies have declared that ionizing radiation can directly
cause
DNA damage.4 In addition, ionizing radiation
causes radiation decomposition of water and stimulates nitric oxide
synthase to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen
species (RNS), respectively. Radiation also causes electron leakage
from the mitochondria, resulting in excess ROS and superoxide.5 The toxic effects of these molecules include
DNA/RNA damage, amino acid oxidation, and lipid peroxidation, resulting
in intracellular nucleic acid damage, mutations, and protein and lipid
damage.6,7 Depending on the intensity of the radiation,
the overall acute consequences of radiation on the intestine are tight
junction integrity disruption and crypt and villus epithelial cell
death.8,9 These effects can lead to the development
of inflammation and the destruction of the mucosal barrier, allowing
intestinal contents, especially microorganisms, to flow into the lamina
propria, triggering the recruitment of further inflammatory factors
and immune cells.10,11

With the development of
next-generation sequencing, such as 16S
rRNA gene amplicon analysis, there is new evidence that the intestinal
microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced
intestinal damage. Studies have shown that radiation can cause significant
changes in the gut microbiota.12,13 In addition, a previous
study has shown that microbiome plays an important role in the pathogenesis
of radiation-induced intestinal damage using mice as a model.14 This study demonstrated for the first time that
radiation-induced microbiota dysregulation increases intestinal susceptibility
to injury. However, the mechanism by which sterile mice can resist
radiation damage is unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study
is to (1) investigate the effects of abdominal radiation on the intestinal
microbiota of mice; (2) evaluate the effect of antibiotic pretreatment
on intestinal microbiota reconstruction after radiation-induced intestinal
injury; and (3) explore the protective effect of antibiotic pretreatment
on radiation intestinal injury and its potential mechanism.

Results
Effect
of Abdominal Radiation on Gut Microbiota in Mice
There were
290 common OTUs in the preradiation (Pre.Con14 group)
and postradiation (Post.Con14 group). The Pre group had 181 special
OTUs, and the Post group only had 37 special OTUs (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, the observed species (represents
the number of OTUs actually detected) and chao index (represents the
richness of microorganisms) in the Post group were significantly lower
than those of the Pre group, and the Simpson diversity index (represents
the diversity of microorganisms) in the Post group was significantly
greater than that of the Pre group. The principal component analysis
(PCA) plot showed that the Pre group had a smaller intragroup difference,
while the Post group had a larger intragroup difference (Figure 1C). From the heat
map of the phylum level, the Pre group gut microbiota were mainly
composed of Bacteroidetes (45.9%), Firmicutes (41.3%), Proteobacteria (7.4%), Verrucomicrobia (2.9%), and Actinobacteria (1.2%), while the Post group was mainly
from Bacteroidetes (44.6%), Firmicutes (31.3%), Proteobacteria (22.0%), and Actinobacteria (0.6%)
(Figure 1D).

Effect of Antibiotic Pretreatment on Gut Microbiota before Radiation
in Mice
As shown in Figure 2A, there were only 71 common OTUs in the normal saline
pretreatment group (Pre.Con14 group), metronidazole (MDE) pretreatment
group (Pre.MDE14 group), and antibiotic cocktail (Abx) pretreatment
group (Pre.Abx14 group); 165 special OTUs in the Pre.Con14 group;
54 special OTUs in the Pre.MDE14 group; and 12 special OTUs in the
Pre.Abx14 group. Alpha-diversity analysis results display that the
observed species and chao index in Pre.MDE14 and Pre.Abx14 groups
were significantly lower than those of the Pre.Con14 group, and the
Simpson diversity index in Pre.MDE14 and Pre.Abx14 groups was significantly
greater than that of the Pre.Con14 group (Figure 2B). The PCA plot showed that the main components
of the gut microbiota were changed after antibiotic pretreatment (Figure 2C). From the heat
map of the phylum level, the abundance of all the microbes in the
Pre.Abx14 group was significantly reduced compared to the Pre.Con14
group, whereas the Pre.MDE14 group was only partially reduced (Figure 2D). To make matters
worse, MDE pretreatment resulted in gut dysbiosis and a large increase
in Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia
coli (P < 0.05) and Shigella (P < 0.05), compared
with Ns pretreatment.

Effect of Antibiotic Pretreatment on Reconstruction of Gut Microbiota
3 Months after Radiation
There were 254 common OTUs in the
Post.Con14 group, Post.MDE14 group, and Post.Abx14 group; 21 special
OTUs in the Post.Con14 group; 73 special OTUs in the Post.MDE14 group;
and 44 special OTUs in the Post.Abx14 group (Figure 3A). Compared with the Post.Con14 group, the
observed species and chao index in the Post.MDE14 group were significantly
higher than those in the Post.Con14 group. Although the Post.Abx14
group increased alpha-diversity, there was no statistical difference
(Figure 3B). The PCA
plot showed that the main components of the gut microbiota of mice
were different among three groups (Figure 3C). From the heat map of the phylum level,
the abundance of the microbes in the Post.Abx14 group and Post.MDE14
was significantly higher than that of the Post.Con14 group (Figure 3D).

Effect of Antibiotic Pretreatment
on the Survival Rate and Ileum
Apoptosis and Proliferation in Mice
Compared with the normal
saline pretreatment group (Ns group), the Abx group had a higher survival
rate, but the MDE group could not improve the survival rate after
radiation intestinal injury in mice (Figure 4). In addition, the villus height, crypt
depth, and epithelium thickness of the Abx group were significantly
higher than those in the Ns group and MDE group 12 h and 3 days after
abdominal radiation (Figure S1). As shown
in Figure 5, Abx and
MDE did not affect the protein levels of PCNA and cleaved caspase3
before radiation (Figure 5A). In the chronic stage, the protein levels of PCNA and cleaved
caspase3 in Abx group mice were significantly higher than those in
the other two groups at 1 and 3 months after radiation (Figure 5B,C). In the acute stage, Ki67
staining results revealed that the proliferation of the Abx group
is much better than those in the two other groups 12 h and 3 days
after abdominal radiation (Figure S2).

Effect of Antibiotic Pretreatment
on Ileal Fibrosis in Mice
As shown in Figures 6 and S3, HE, Masson,
and Sirius red staining
results indicated that Abx and MDE pretreatment did not affect the
thickness of submucosa and collagen expression in the ileum before
abdominal radiation. 1 and 3 months after abdominal radiation, the
thickness of submucosa and collagen expression significantly increased
in the Ns and MDE groups, whereas the Abx pretreatment significantly
reduced the thickness of submucosa and collagen expression in the
ileum, compared with the other two groups.

Effect of Antibiotic Pretreatment on the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
p65 Signaling Pathway in the Ileum of Mice
Abx and MDE pretreatment
(0.008, 0.008, and 0.008 pg/mL for the NS, MDE, and Abx groups, respectively)
did not affect the content of LPS in ileum tissue before the mice
received abdominal radiation (Figure 7A). However, 12 h (1.467, 2.126, and 0.223 pg/mL for
the NS, MDE, and Abx groups, respectively) and 3 days (0.222, 0.35,
and 0.127 pg/mL for the NS, MDE, and Abx groups, respectively) after
the radiation, the Abx group significantly reduced the LPS content
in the ileum, compared with the other two groups (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B–D, Abx and MDE pretreatment
did not change the protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, and phosphorylated
NF-κB p65 in ileum tissue before abdominal radiation. After
radiation for 12 h and 3 days, the protein abundance of TLR4, MyD88,
and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 was significantly lower in the
Abx group than that in Ns and MDE groups.

Abx and MDE pretreatment
did not affect the protein expression of iNOS and CD163 in ileum tissue
before abdominal radiation (Figure 8A). The protein abundance of iNOS (M1 maker) and CD163
(M2 maker) was remarkably downregulated in the Abx group than that
in Ns and MDE groups.

As shown in Figure 9, the protein levels
of TGF-β1, phosphorylated Smad-3, and α-SMA in the Abx
group were significantly lower than those in the Ns and MDE groups
in the ileum, 1 and 3 months after radiation. In contrast, the protein
abundance of Smad-3 and E-cadherin in the Abx group was significantly
higher than those in Ns and MDE groups.

Discussion
Radiation
therapy is a commonly used method in cancer therapy,
especially in the treatment of gynecological and colorectal cancer.
About 60% of patients with gynecological or colorectal cancer have
received radiation therapy, and about 75% of them have symptoms of
gastrointestinal discomfort caused by radiotherapy, including diarrhea,
abdominal pain, malabsorption, rectal bleeding, urgency, and fecal
incontinence.15−17 In the current study, we confirmed that abdominal
radiation therapy caused gut microbiota disorder and reduced alpha-
and beta-diversity in mice, which was consistent with previous findings
in clinical patients.18 In addition, we
systematically investigated the effect of antibiotic pretreatment
on the reconstruction of gut microbiota after radiation, its protective
effect on radiation-induced intestinal injury, and its potential mechanism,
using microbiota analysis and molecular biology technology. Our findings
showed that Abx pretreatment can significantly increase the reconstitution
of gut microbiota after radiation in mice. Furthermore, Abx pretreatment
alleviated radiation-induced intestinal damage by regulating the LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
p65/macrophage polarization/TGF-β1/Smad-3 signaling pathway
and ultimately improved viability of mice.

In the present study,
we used 16S rRNA sequencing technology to
compare the composition of the gut microbiota of mice before and after
radiation. Our data showed that abdominal radiation caused gut microbiota
disorder and at the same time caused a decrease in the diversity of
intestinal microbiota in mice, which was consistent with the sequencing
results of intestinal microbiota in patients with clinical radiation-induced
intestinal diseases.18 In addition, abdominal
radiation can result in an increase in several intestinal pathogens. Proteobacteria contains abundant pathogenic bacteria,
which are low in healthy mice.19 This study
found that the abundance of proteobacteria was significantly increased after radiation (from 7.4 to 22.0%).
Meanwhile, the abundance of Verrucomicrobia was decreased from 2.9 to 0.0006% after radiation. A recent study
has shown that Verrucomicrobia may
have potential anti-inflammatory properties.20 The reduction of Verrucomicrobia abundance
in our study indicated that mice after abdominal radiation may be
more susceptible to inflammatory reactions. A previous study demonstrated
that radiation-induced intestinal damage leads to changes in the metabolomics
of the intestine in mice, reducing short-chain fatty acids, including
acetate, propionate, and butyrate.21 Therefore,
we speculate that the change in the intestinal microenvironment promoted
or inhibited the colonization of certain specific bacteria, leading
to reduction of the gut microbiota diversity. Excessive proliferation
of pathogenic bacteria may induce bacteremia and impairment of postradiation
intestinal mucosal repair, eventually leading to unfavorable prognosis
of radiation enteropathy.

Previous studies have found that sterile
mice under the same dose
of radiation have minor epithelial cell damage than specific-pathogen-free
(SPF) mice.14 This study suggested that
the gut microbiota played an important role in intestinal radiation
damage. Thus, we first performed different antibiotic pretreatments
on mice to clear their intestinal microbiota. Our findings showed
that the Abx pretreatment could effectively remove most of the intestinal
microbiota in the feces of mice, simulating the intestinal environment
of sterile mice. However, the pretreatment of MDE could only remove
some intestinal bacteria and aggravate intestinal microbiota disorder
in mice. We further studied the effects of antibiotic pretreatment
on the remodeling ability of intestinal microbiota at 3 months after
radiation. Our data suggested that the antibiotic pretreatment groups
had more special OTUs than the control group. In addition, compared
with the control group, the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia in the Abx pretreatment group was markedly increased. The reconstitution
effect of MDE pretreatment on intestinal microbiota after radiation
was also superior to that of the control group, and the relative abundance
of Verrucomicrobia was also improved.
Taken together, Abx pretreatment enhanced the reconstitution ability
of intestinal microbiota after radiation, and the intestinal microbiota
diversity was better than that of the control group. Although pretreatment
with MDE aggravated the intestinal microbiota disorder in mice, it
also improved the ability of the intestinal microbiota reconstitution
after radiation-induced intestinal injury, and the diversity of the
reconstructed intestinal microbiota was more abundant.

In addition
to disrupting the structure and composition of the
gut microbiota, abdominal radiation can also induce intestinal inflammation
and mucosal barrier dysfunction.22−24 Our results revealed
that the mortality rate of mice in Ns and MDE pretreatment groups
after abdominal radiation is higher, and the pretreatment of Abx could
significantly improve the survival rate of mice after radiation. Moreover,
protein expression of PCNA and cleaved caspase3 showed that the intestinal
epithelial cells of Abx pretreatment group mice had stronger proliferative
ability and apoptosis ability at 1 month and 3 months after radiation.
Apoptosis refers to the orderly death of cells that are controlled
by genes to maintain homeostasis. Apoptosis is not a phenomenon of
autologous injury under pathological conditions, but a death process
that is actively pursued to better adapt to the living environment.25 The increase in apoptosis and cell proliferation
at 1 and 3 months after radiation indicated that Abx pretreatment
contributed to intestinal epithelial cell recovery and regeneration.
Studies have shown that the presence of a large number of bacteria
in the gut may enter the bloodstream when the intestinal mucosal barrier
is impaired, leading to bacteremia and toxemia, thereby aggravating
intestinal wall damage and leading to systemic inflammatory response
and increased mortality.26,27 In this study, compared
with the control group (Ns group), the content of LPS in the ileum
was significantly reduced in the Abx-pretreated mice. A previous study
demonstrated that TLR4 antagonist C34 pretreatment reduces radiation-induced
cell damage and death in mice.28 Consistently,
our study revealed that the protein abundance of TLR4 in the ileum
was significantly reduced in the ileum of Abx-pretreated mice. Furthermore,
the protein expression of MyD88 and phosphorylated NF-κB p65
was also inhibited in the Abx pretreatment group. A recent study suggested
that the macrophage migration inhibitory factor serves a pivotal role
in the regulation of radiation-induced cardiac senescence.29 In the present study, the protein expression
of M1 macrophage marker iNOS and M2 macrophage marker CD163 in the
ileum of the Abx pretreatment group was significantly lower than that
of the control group. The increase in macrophage populations in the
lamina propria of the gut is thought to be involved in fibrosis of
the intestine, and macrophage-secreting cytokines such as TGF-β1
could drive the deposition and fibrosis of fibroblasts and extracellular
matrices.30 At week 26 after radiation,
TGF-β1 in fibroblasts in lamina propria, endothelial cells,
and smooth muscle remained at a high level.31 Our findings showed that Abx pretreatment inhibits the protein abundance
of TGF-β1, phosphorylated Smad-3, and α-SMA, suggesting
that Abx could reduce intestinal wall fibrosis by downregulating TGF-β1/Smad-3
signaling pathways in radiated mice.

In summary, we report herein
that abdominal radiation causes intestinal
microecological disturbances, reduces microbe diversity, and increases
the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Proteobacteria in mice. Abx and MDE pretreatment
are conducive to reconstitute the intestinal microbiota of radiated
mice. Furthermore, Abx pretreatment alleviates intestinal damage by
regulating LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB p65/macrophage polarization/TGF-β1/Smad-3
signaling pathways, ultimately improving the viability of mice with
postradiation intestinal damage. Thus, our findings provide a potential
therapy for mammals at risk of abdominal radiation-induced intestinal
damage.

Materials and Methods
Animal and Experimental Design
Male
C57BL/6 mice aged
8–10 weeks were purchased from the Institute of Model Animals
of Nanjing University and entrusted to the Department of Comparative
Medicine of Jinling Hospital for breeding and management. All experimental
mice were housed in the SPF environment, maintained at constant temperature
and humidity, maintained for 12 h light/dark cycle, free eating and
drinking, and fed adaptively for at least 1 week before the experiment.
The use and operation of laboratory animals are in accordance with
the “Guidelines for the Protection and Application of Laboratory
Animals” issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication
no. 85-23, 1996 version) and the corresponding regulations of the
Animal Management Committee of Jinling Hospital (JH-20180714).

Antibiotic
Pretreatment Program
In order to simulate
the sterile condition, we performed antibiotic pretreatment on the
mice. Mice were divided into the normal saline group (Ns group or
Con group), MDE group, and Abx group. The MDE group had a MDE concentration
of 1 g/L; the Abx treatment group consisted of MDE 1 g/L, vancomycin
0.5 g/L, ampicillin 1 g/L, and gentamicin 1 g/L. The mice were intragastrically
administered once a day, 0.4 mL each time, for a total of 14 days.

Abdominal Radiation Program
After intragastric administration
for 14 days, C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with an appropriate amount
of pentobarbital (1%, 35 mg/kg). After the mice were anesthetized,
the mice were fixed on cardboard. The mice were then subjected to
a local high-dose abdominal precision radiation (225 kV/17 mA Cs137
linear accelerator with a dose rate of 2 Gy/min*5 min and a single
dose of 10 Gy). Radiation range: concentrated in the two-leg connection
level to the above 2 cm area, and the rest of the body was shielded
with a 5 cm lead.

Sample Collection
The mice were
sacrificed by cervical
dislocation. The abdominal cavity was opened by midline incision,
the terminal ileum and cecum of the mouse were cut with sterile scissors,
and the feces of the terminal ileum and cecum were inhaled into a
1.5 mL enzyme-free sterile tube, each about 200 mg, at 14 days after
intragastrical administration (Pre groups, including the Pre.Con14
group, Pre.MDE14, and Pre.Abx14 group) and 3 months after radiation
(Post groups, including the Post.Con14 group, Post.MDE14, and Post.Abx14
group). In addition, a segment of the ileum from the same position
of each animal was collected immediately and washed three times in
ice-cold PBS buffer. The tissue samples were frozen immediately in
liquid nitrogen or fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde.

Protein Extraction
and Western Blot Analysis
Total
protein was extracted using basic lysis buffer. The protein concentration
was measured using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA). After the proteins had been denatured by boiling for 5 min,
they were separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BioTrace; Pall Corp., USA). The membrane
was blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4
°C with the specific primary antibodies. After several washes
in Tris-buffered saline with Tween, membranes were incubated with
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After several washes,
bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the LumiGlo
substrate (Super Signal West Pico; Pierce, USA), and the signals were
recorded by an imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA) and analyzed with Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad, USA). GAPDH was used as a loading control in
the western blot. Protein abundance was expressed as the fold change
relative to the mean value of the control group. Information about
the antibodies is shown in Table 1.

LPS Assay
The LPS content in ileum tissue was measured
by LPS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (CSB-E13066m, CUSABIO).
The procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

HE, Mason, Sirius Red, TUNEL, and Ki67 Staining
Specimens
of the ileum were prepared for histological examination by fixing
in 4% polyformaldehyde-buffered solution, embedding in paraffin, and
sectioning. Specimens were examined for injury after hematoxylin and
eosin staining as described by a previous study.32

For Masson staining, the sections were placed in
Gill-modified hematoxylin staining solution for 5–10 min and
rinsed with deionized water. Then, place the sections in the hydrochloric
acid alcohol differentiation solution for several tens of seconds
and rinse for several minutes with running water. They were stained
with Masson complex staining solution for 5–10 min, slightly
washed with deionized water, treated with 1% phosphotungstic acid
solution for about 5 min, and aniline blue was used as a counterstain
for 5 min and treated with 1% glacial acetic acid for 1 min. It is
dehydrated by 95% alcohol, dehydrated with anhydrous ethanol, transparent
with xylene, and sealed with neutral gum.

For Sirius red staining,
the sections were stained with Sirius
Red staining for 1 h. They were rinsed with deionized water to remove
excess staining from the surface of the section. It is conventionally
dehydrated, transparent, and covered with a neutral gum. It is naturally
dried, stored at room temperature, and placed under an ordinary light
microscope for observation.

Apoptotic epithelial cells in the
ileum were analyzed using the
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. TUNEL-positive nuclei were clearly identified as brown-stained
nuclei, which indicated the presence of DNA fragmentation because
of apoptosis. TUNEL-positive cells were determined by observing 1000
cells in randomly selected fields.

DNA Extraction, 16S rRNA
Gene Amplification, and Sequencing
Total DNA was extracted
from 200 mg of each fecal specimen using
the QIAamp R Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen Ltd., Germany) in accordance
with manufacturer’s instructions. The V4 region of the 16S
rRNA gene was amplified with universal primers 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA)
and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT), as described by a previous study.33 The amplified products were detected using agarose
gel electrophoresis (2% agarose), recovered using an AxyPrep DNA Gel
Recovery Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, United States),
and then quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, United States) to pool into equimolar amounts. Amplicon
libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, United States) for paired-end reads of 250 bp.

Analysis
of Sequencing Data
The raw paired-end reads
were assembled into longer sequences and quality-filtered using PANDAseq
(version 2.9) to remove the low-quality reads with a length of <220
nucleotides (nt) or >500 nt, an average quality score of <20,
and
sequences containing >3 nitrogenous bases.34 The high-quality sequences were clustered into OTUs with a 97% similarity
using UPARSE (version 7.0)35 in QIIME (version
1.8),36 and the chimeric sequences were
removed using UCHIME.37 Taxonomy was assigned
to OTUs using the RDP classifier38 against
the SILVA 16S rRNA gene database,39 with
a confidence threshold of 70%.

The observed species, Chao index,
and Simpson diversity index per sample were calculated by the MOTHUR
program (version v.1.30.1).40 Heat maps
were generated with the “vegan” package in R (version
3.3.1). PCA was performed based on Bray–Curtis distances using
QIIME (version 1.8).

Statistical Analysis
Data were presented
as means ±
SD. The numbers of replicates used for statistics are noted in the
figures. The difference in the alpha-diversity was tested using Dunnett’s t-test (SPSS 20.0). To determine differences between groups
at a single time point, data were tested using 1-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. The corrected P-values below 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
Postradiation survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier
method and compared using the log-rank test.
