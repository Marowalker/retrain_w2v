The
synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted benzo[b]thiophenes
with selective placement of a chlorine moiety at the 3 position while
maintaining diversity at the 2 position has only been accomplished
by a handful of conditions in the past. The development of a greener,
less expensive, and simpler method is paramount for the exploration
of innovative compounds for application in medicinal and materials
chemistry. Herein, the first reported copper-catalyzed electrophilic
chlorocyclization method was developed and employed across diverse
substrates to generate highly functionalized 2,3-disubstituted benzo[b]thiophenes and 2,3,5-trisubstituted thiophenes in very
high yields. This method was optimized in both ethanol and acetonitrile
in a comparative solvent study. The utility of this method was further
expanded beyond chlorocyclization by changing the sodium halide to
generate bromo- and iodocyclization products in excellent yields.

Introduction
The significant inclusion
of chlorine moieties in heterocyclic
compounds in the development of drug molecules since 1984 has seen
more than 60 approved drugs including lornoxicam, alprazolam, loracarbef,
cefaclor, and chlorphenamine.1 Chlorination
of drug molecules is an established method to optimize molecular properties
in absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity;
structure; and half-life.2 The intrinsic
properties of halogens provide diverse reactivity, but regioselective
synthesis of heterocyclic molecules containing halogens has proven
to be challenging. Common methodologies for synthesizing halogenated
heterocycles include electrophilic aromatic substitution with toxic
and corrosive reagents,3 conversion of
amine to halogen via explosive diazonium salts,4 and directed metalation using pyrophoric lithium and magnesium
reagents.5 The development of a green,
regioselective, and effective methodology for the synthesis of chlorinated
heterocycles is an urgent need.

Heterocyclic core structures
such as benzo[b]thiophene
and thiophenes functionalized at the 2 and 3 positions have demonstrated
diverse medicinal applications. Compounds containing benzo[b]thiophene derivatives are known for their use as antimicrobial,6 anticancer,7 antiviral,8 antidepressant,9 antifungal,10 anti-inflammatory,11 analgesic,12 and estrogen receptor-mediating
agents.13 The introduction of chlorine
at the 3 position enhances the anticancer and antiviral properties
of compounds.7,8 Similar molecules with a bromine
at the 3 position showed improved analgesic and anti-inflammatory
activity.14

Until recently, generating
3-chlorosubstituted benzo[b]thiophenes while maintaining
diverse functionality at the 2 position
has proven difficult. Wu provided a methodology that generated good
yields of chloro-/bromocyclized derivatives that required 2 equiv
of CuCl2 or CuCl2/PdCl2.15 Palladium is a remarkable metal with innumerable
applications, but the use of a large amount of expensive Pd and an
excess of copper incurs a financial challenge. Wang used N-chlorosuccinimide
to generate moderate yields of desired 3-chlorobenzo[b]thiophenes but required the use of an electron-rich ynamide starting
substrate.16 Lu’s work was the first
to report chlorocyclization with high yields but required 2 equiv
of CuCl2.17 We recently reported
a potent method using relatively inexpensive CuSO4 along
with NaCl for generating 2,3-disubstituted benzo[b]thiophene derivatives with the desired chlorine moiety at the 3
position.18 The yields were higher and
reaction conditions were milder compared to previous methodologies,
but an excess of CuSO4 was required. The need for the development
of a reduced amount of transition metal has prompted our research
on the development of simple and high-yielding copper-catalyzed electrophilic
chlorocyclization reactions for the synthesis of benzo[b]thiophenes and thiophenes. The development of a copper-catalyzed
chlorocyclization reaction would be a boon in the advancement of synthesizing
chlorinated heterocyclic compounds.

In this work, we report
the first copper-catalyzed electrophilic
chlorocyclization reaction using an external oxidant (Scheme 1). The introduction of an oxidant
to generate a catalytic copper cycle in Wacker oxidation has been
explored thoroughly by Stahl and co-workers.19 Herein, we explored a similar copper catalytic cycle to reduce the
amount of CuSO4 required by employing an external oxidant.
Interestingly, this has never been explored in electrophilic chlorocyclization
reactions.

Scheme 1 Thioanisole-containing compounds are known to
generate sulfoxides
or sulfones in the presence of an oxidant,20 and therefore, our first concern was to find an oxidant that would
not form oxidation byproducts while converting copper(I) to copper(II).
As our starting point, 1 equiv of starting alkynyl thioanisole 1, 0.5 equiv of CuSO4, 5 equiv of NaCl, and 3 mL
of acetonitrile were allowed to react for an appropriate amount of
time at 70 °C using a chosen oxidant along with co-oxidant oxygen
(Table 1). A series
of oxidants such as para-quinone, (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl
(TEMPO), hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hypochlorite were investigated,
which resulted in dismal yields (entries 2–5). Selectfluor
generated moderate yields of the product, but it simultaneously produced
byproducts, evident from thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of the reaction
mixture, that were not isolated (entry 6). The cyclization attempt
with 1 equiv of cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) along with co-oxidant
O2 resulted in no product (entry 7). However, addition
of CAN 30 min after the start of the reaction resulted in a 90% yield
of the desired product (entry 8). Further optimization was performed
to lower the amount of CAN. We found that the sequential addition
of a total of 0.4 equiv of CAN over the period of 6 h generated a
99% product in 24 h (entry 9). Our attempts to lower the amount of
copper below 0.5 equiv failed, as reducing CuSO4 resulted
in the lower yields of the product (entries 10 and 11). It should
be noted that the reaction was also attempted at room temperature,
but no desired product was obtained. A series of copper catalysts
were selected to determine which catalyst worked the best under our
reaction conditions. Copper (II) salts such as CuCl2 and
copper(II) acetate generated the desired cyclized product 1a in 97 and 93% yields, respectively (entries 13 and 14). The copper(I)
salt CuCl resulted in the formation of 1a in a 92% yield,
suggesting that CAN was used for performing the desired oxidation
of Cu(I) to Cu(II) in the catalytic cycle (entry 15). This inference
was further supported when it was found that employing Cu(0) for the
chlorocyclization reaction generated 1a in a 57% yield
(entry 16). CuSO4 was selected as the copper salt as it
is inexpensive, and the SO42– anion is
a weakly coordinating anion in the reaction allowing for a diversity
of halogens with the same copper salt by altering the sodium halide.
In search for a better solvent system, we explored solvents such as
methanol, tert-butanol, water, nitromethane, ethyl
acetate, and toluene (entries 17–22). It was found that ethanol,
methanol, and ethyl acetate gave promising yields, whereas tert-butanol, water, nitromethane, and toluene resulted
in undesirably poor yields. Because of its environmentally benign
properties, ethanol was selected as the solvent of choice for further
optimization. Modifications were made to generate higher yields of
the product by increasing the amount of CAN to 0.6 equiv, shortening
the sequential addition time to 3 h, and allowing the reaction to
run for 48 h (entries 23–25).

a All reactions were performed using
0.30 mmol of the alkyne, 5 equiv of NaCl, and 5 mL of solvent in the
presence of O2 balloon at 70 °C for 24 h.

b CAN was added 30 min after the reaction
was started.

c CAN was added
in increments of 0.1
equiv every 2 h.

d CAN was
added in increments of 0.1
equiv every 30 min, and the reaction was carried out for 48 h.

Once the optimal conditions were
established, each reaction was
performed using 0.3 mmol of starting 2-alkynylthioanisole, 1.5 mmol
of the appropriate sodium halide, 0.15 mmol of CuSO4, and
5 mL of solvent in the presence of O2. The amount of CAN
employed was a total of 0.12 and 0.18 mmol in the acetonitrile and
ethanol reactions, respectively. Various substrates were tested to
provide an overview of our reaction’s viability. Each substrate
was tested in acetonitrile and ethanol for a direct comparison. First,
we investigated the chlorocyclization reaction using a variety of
thioanisole substrates 1–9 (Table 2). As mentioned earlier, the phenyl substrate 1 resulted in the formation of 3-chlorobenzo[b]thiophene 1a in a near-perfect yield of 98 and 99%
in ethanol and acetonitrile, respectively. The electronically rich p-methoxyphenyl substrate proceeded highly favorably to
generate 2a with comparable yields of 88 and 94%. When
electron-deficient p-cyanophenyl-substituted alkynyl
thioanisole 3 was subjected to our cyclization condition,
the resulting cyclized product 3a was obtained in a high
yield of 97% in acetonitrile and 80% in ethanol. The observed yields
with electron-rich methoxy and electron-poor nitrile groups suggest
that changing the electronics of the remote phenyl group does not
have a significant effect on the reaction yield.

a Method A. All reactions were performed
using 0.30 mmol of the alkyne, 5 equiv of NaCl, 0.5 equiv of CuSO4, 0.6 equiv of CAN, and 5 mL of ethanol with an O2 balloon at 70 °C for 48 h. Method B. All reactions were performed
using 0.30 mmol of the alkyne, 5 equiv of NaCl, 0.5 equiv of CuSO4, 0.4 equiv of CAN, and 5 mL of CH3CN with an O2 balloon at 70 °C for 24 h.

b Isolated yield.

A linear alkyl chain substrate 4 resulted in 4a with an excellent yield of 86% when ethanol was employed
as the solvent and 76% yield with acetonitrile using method B. The
cyclization reaction was completed with ease with a sterically large tert-butyl group and resulted in comparable yields of 84
and 81% in both solvents. Ethanol was found to be superior with most
substrates with the exception of trimethylsilyl (TMS) and p-methoxyphenyl alkynes. The TMS-substituted alkyne, when
subjected to our reaction conditions, generated a side product resulting
from the addition of Cl2 across the alkyne along with 6a as observed from gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS). In acetonitrile, a higher yield of 6a was obtained, and less alkyne addition product was observed. Alcohol
and nitrile groups were well tolerated as the reaction proceeded with
success and resulted in the formation of desired cyclized products 7a and 8a in excellent yields of 92 and 82%,
respectively, in ethanol and slightly lower yields of 83 and 62%,
respectively, in acetonitrile. There was a dramatic difference of
yield in generating the thiophene product. The reaction was carried
out smoothly with substrates that contributed electronically. In summary,
the chlorocyclization yields seemed to be better across the board
when ethanol was employed as the solvent except with the TMS and p-methoxyphenyl groups.

After these encouraging results
from chlorocyclization, we employed
bromocyclization reaction conditions with NaBr instead of NaCl while
keeping the other conditions the same. The bromocyclization reaction
resulted in higher or comparable yields of the desired bromocyclized
product when compared with the existing literature procedures. A similar
trend of higher yields in ethanol versus acetonitrile was observed
with most of the substrates except alkynes substituted with TMS, p-methoxyphenyl, and hydroxymethyl. Cyclization of TMS substrate 6 in MeCN resulted in the desired benzo[b]thiophene 6b in an 80% yield, whereas in ethanol the
yield was only 64%. In both reactions, a side product was obtained
where a bromine molecule was added to the alkyne instead of performing
the desired cyclization reaction, as determined by NMR (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Scheme 3 Additionally, sodium
iodide was employed as the source of electrophile
in our cyclization reaction to generate the desired 3-iodinated benzo[b]thiophene (Scheme 3). The sodium iodide trials generated high yields of the cyclized
3-iodobenzo[b]thiophenes. Once again, the iodocyclization
reaction resulted in higher or comparable yields of the desired 3-iodobenzo[b]thiophenes compared with current literature procedures.
The only exception occurred with TMS and electron-rich p-methoxyphenyl-substituted alkynes. The p-methoxyphenylalkynyl
group resulted in significantly lower yields in acetonitrile compared
to ethanol, whereas the TMS-substituted alkyne failed to generate
any iodocyclized product in ethanol but generated a clean 92% yield
in acetonitrile.

It is well established that CuI2 is unstable and decomposes
to CuI and I2; therefore, the mechanism for iodocyclization
seems to involve molecular I2 as the electrophile, whose
formation was observed in the reaction mixture. Bromocyclization was
investigated further to determine if Br2 or CuBr2 was the electrophile. Anisole 10 when reacted with
NaBr, CuSO4, and CAN in ethanol at 72 °C for 6 h generated
70% 4-bromoanisole 11, suggesting electrophilic aromatic
substitution involving Br2 (Scheme 4). Therefore, we concluded that in situ generated
Br2 and I2 is the driving mechanism for the
bromo-/iodocyclization reaction.

Scheme 4 A possible mechanism of the
chlorocyclization reaction is outlined
in Scheme 5. Chlorocyclization
occurs by the generation of CuCl2 in situ from NaCl and
CuSO4. CuCl2 is very stable, and unlike CuI2 or CuBr2, it does not disproportionate. We believe
that CuCl2 coordinates across the alkyne 12 providing an ideal situation for antiattack from a nearby sulfur
nucleophile. The resulting cationic intermediate 13 undergoes
an SN2-like displacement by a chloride anion to generate
methyl chloride. Finally, copper undergoes reductive elimination to
afford the chlorocyclized product 12a and copper(0).
Copper(0) is readily oxidized back to Cu(II) by the Ce(IV) species
present in CAN. The resulting Ce(III) is oxidized back to cerium(IV)
by O2 for only a few cycles before becoming poisoned.

Scheme 5 Conclusions
We have successfully developed the first
copper-catalyzed halocyclization
method with a diverse library of substrates in high yields. This method
allows for considerable advancement in synthetic and medicinal chemistry
by expanding the limited existing methodology to generate chloro-substituted
benzo[b]thiophene derivatives. The ability to alter
the conditions to achieve bromo and iodo electrophilic cyclization
enhances the diversity of the method. Employment of cheap, readily
available, and greener reagents while developing the first copper-catalyzed
electrophilic cyclization method achieved the desired reaction conditions
and outcomes needed for innovative chemistry.

General Experimental Methods
Chemicals and solvents were either purchased and employed directly
from commercial suppliers. 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker 100 MHz NMR spectrometer. GC–MS spectra
were obtained on a GCMS-QP2010 SE from an electron ionization (EI)
source. A VG-70S magnetic sector mass spectrometer was employed to
record the high-resolution mass spectra. Samples were introduced using
a direct probe and ionized via EI. TLC was employed to monitor reactions
with silica gel 60 F254 plates. Compounds were isolated
via column chromatography using silica gel 60–120 mesh. Well-established
literature procedures were employed to prepare alkynes 1–9.18
