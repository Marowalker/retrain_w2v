Introduction
Owing to the unique
structural tailorability and compositional
diversity, coordination polymers (CPs) have received much attention
and become a hot topic due to their appealing applications as functional
materials in adsorption separation, magnetism, luminescence, electrochemical
sensors, and so on.1 The variety of the
structures relies on the presence of suitable metal–ligand
interactions and supramolecular contacts, which is directly related
to the coordination characteristics of the components, such as the
charge and radius of metal ions, the amount of dentate and steric
hindrance of the ligands, etc.2 Although
many CPs with intriguing topologies have been reported, the control
of precise structures of CPs remains a great challenge in crystal
engineering.3

The idea of mixed ligands
can indeed obtain a great diversity of
CPs.4 However, the resulting structures
are somewhat unpredictable and the governing principles in this system
are less ascertained and remain elusive.5 The organic polycarboxylates as mixed ligand components are considered
as a kind of remarkable building blocks in the construction of CPs.6 They have the ability to balance charges, good
coordination ability, and stability in acid and base.7 On the other hand, bipyridine derivatives are good neutral
organic ligands, which not only have various classes but also show
excellent coordination ability and spatial expansion ability in the
process of assembling with metal ions.8,9 Heterocyclic
bridged bis-pyridine bis-amides are regarded as a kind of remarkable
linking ligands.10 First, they have the
coordination ability similar to other bis-pyridine ligands;11 second, they have a variable conformation and
good structure-expanding ability because of the semirigid organic
skeleton.12 Thus, it is meaningful to investigate
the effect of the combination of polycarboxylates and heterocyclic
bridged dipyridine diamide mixed ligands on tuning the architectures
of CPs.

Among the transition-metal ions, Ni2+ and
Cu2+ ions are widely used in the synthesis of CPs due to
their potential
as electrochemical active centers and excellent coordination abilities
with N-/O-donor ligands.13 However, compared
with Cd2+, Zn2+, and Co2+ ions, semirigid-bis-pyridine-bis-amide-based
Ni/Cu CPs are rarely reported, to the best of our knowledge.14 Based on above consideration, to investigate
the effect of the polycarboxylates and metal ions on the structures
and properties of Ni-/Cu-based complexes, six organic polycarboxylates
(1,2-H2BDC = 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H2IP = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 5-H2MIP = 5-methylisophthalic
acid, 5-H2NIP = 5-nitroisophthalic acid, 5-H2AIP = 5-aminoisophthalic acid, and 1,3,5-H3BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic
acid) and a thiophene-containing bis-pyridyl-bis-amide [3-bptpa = N,N′-bis(pyridine-3-yl)thiophene-2,5-dicarboxamide]
were selected to react with Ni/Cu ions under hydrothermally/solvothermally
conditions. As a result, nine 0D → 3D complexes of [Ni2(3-bptpa)4(1,2-BDC)2(H2O)2] (1), [Ni(3-bptpa)(IP)(H2O)2]·H2O (2), [Ni(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)(H2O)2]·H2O (3), [Ni(3-bptpa)(5-NIP)(H2O)] (4), [Ni(3-bptpa)(5-AIP)]·2H2O (5), [Ni2(OH)(3-bptpa)(1,3,5-BTC)]·DMA·5H2O (6), [Cu(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)]·3H2O (7), [Cu(3-bptpa)(5-AIP)(H2O)0.25]·H2O (8), and [Cu(3-bptpa)(1,3,5-HBTC)]
(9) (DMA = N,N′-dimethylacetamide)
were obtained and structurally characterized by IR, thermogravimetric
(TG), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
The effect of the metal ions and polycarboxylates on the structures
of the title complexes was discussed in detail. The different fluorescent
properties of 1–9 and multiple electrocatalytic
activities of 3, 5, 6–9 for ascorbic acid (AA), hydrogen peroxide, nitrites, and
bromates are investigated.

Results and Discussion
[Ni2(3-bptpa)4(1,2-BDC)2(H2O)2] (1)
The single-crystal
X-ray study reveals that complex 1 is a one-dimensional
(1D) supramolecular structure based on a zero-dimensional (0D) bimetallic
complex. There are two crystallographically independent Ni(II) cations,
four 3-bptpa ligands, two 1,2-BDC anions, and two coordinated water
molecules, as displayed in Figure 1. The central Ni1/Ni2 cations
are six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two 3-bptpa ligands,
two carboxylic oxygen atoms of two 1,2-BDC anions, and two oxygen
atoms from two coordinated water molecules. The Ni–N bond distances
are in the range of 2.053(5)–2.071(5) Å, and the Ni–O
bond lengths lie in the range of 2.037(3)–2.148(4) Å.
The bond angles around Ni(II) cations vary from 83.37(14) to 177.15(16)°,
indicating that the octahedrons are slightly distorted.

environment of Ni(II) ions and the binuclear structure
in 1.

In complex 1, 3-bptpa shows a single-dentate coordination
mode, which is unusual in the pyridine-amide-based complexes.14 In the 1,2-BDC anion, only one carboxylic group
coordinates with two Ni ions to form a bimetallic complex; another
carboxylic group does not coordinate with the Ni ion but deprotonates
for the charge balance (Figure 1). The adjacent 0D discrete complexes are linked by hydrogen-bonding
interactions between uncoordinated carboxylic group/coordinated water/amide
to form a 1D chain (Figure S1). The corresponding
hydrogen-bonding parameters of the complex are listed in Table S10. Generally speaking, organic dicarboxylate
and bis-pyridine-bis-amide are two kinds of well-bridged ligands and
are usually used to construct 1D, two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional
(3D) coordination polymers.15 In 1, 3-bptpa and 1,2-BDC are both acting as terminal-type ligands
to form a discrete complex, which is unusual.

[Ni(3-bptpa)(IP)(H2O)2]·H2O (2) and [Ni(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)(H2O)2]·H2O (3)
H2IP and
5-H2MIP were selected instead of 1,2-BDC in the synthetic
process. As a result, two similar 1D ladderlike structures of 2–3 with different structural details
were obtained. Herein, only complex 2 is selected as
a representative example for a detailed structural description. Complex 2 contains one Ni(II) center, an IP anion, one 3-bptpa ligand,
two coordinated water molecules, and one lattice water molecule. As
shown in Figure 2a,
the Ni(II) center is six-coordinated with octahedral coordination
geometry: two N atoms belonging to two 3-bptpa ligands, four O atoms
from two IP anions, and two coordinated water molecules. The Ni–O
bond lengths are in the range of 2.046(2)–2.084(2) Å,
and the Ni–N bond lengths are 2.092(2) and 2.146(2) Å.
The bond angles around the Ni(II) cation are in the range of 85.39(7)–178.59(7)°,
which agree with those previously reported for Ni(II) complexes.13a

In complex 2, two 3-bptpa connect
two Ni(II) ions
to form a Ni2(3-bptpa)2 loop with the Ni–Ni
separation of 7.756 Å. Pairs of IP anions link the bimetallic
loops to generate a 1D ladderlike band (Figure 2b). The 1D bands cross each other forming
a 3D supramolecular structure, which is extended by the hydrogen bonds
derived from the amide, carboxylic groups, and coordinated/lattice
water molecules (Figures 2c,d and S2). The hydrogen-bonding
parameters of 2 are listed in Table S11. The structural details of complex 3 are displayed
in Figure S3. To the best of our knowledge,
there are many kinds of modes for 1D coordination polymers to extend
into 3D supramolecular networks, such as parallel arrangement, cross
arrangement, weave pattern, and spiral pattern.9a In 2 and 3, the 3D supramolecular
arrays derived from 1D tubular coordination polymers show a cross
arrangement, which is unusual in amide-based complexes.

[Ni(3-bptpa)(5-NIP)(H2O)] (4)
To further investigate the effect
of the uncoordinated groups of
“V”-type dicarboxylates, 5-H2NIP with nitro
was selected instead of 5-H2MIP with methyl in the synthetic
process. As a result, a wavelike 2D network of complex 4 based on [Ni(5-NIP)] linear chains and [Ni(3-bptpa)] helixes is
obtained. As illustrated in Figure 3a, a crystallographically independent Ni(II) ion is
octahedrally coordinated by two nitrogen atoms from two 3-bptpa, three
oxygen atoms from two 5-NIP, and one coordination water molecule.
The Ni–O bond lengths lie in the range of 2.067(3)–2.240(3)
Å, and the Ni–N bond lengths are 2.056(4) and 2.067(4)
Å. The bond angles around the Ni(II) cation change from 61.07(11)
to 177.58(13)°.

(b) 2D network based on [Ni(3-bptpa)] helixes and [Ni(5-NIP)] linear
chains. (c) Schematic view of the 2D (4,4)-connected network.

The two carboxylic groups of a 5-NIP anion in 4 act
as single-dentate and chelating coordination modes to coordinate with
Ni(II) ions forming a 1D linear chain with the Ni–Ni separation
of 10.167 Å. 3-bptpa ligands link the adjacent Ni ions to generate
a 1D helix with the Ni–Ni distance of 13.177 Å. The above
two chains are connected by Ni ions to form a (4,4)-connected 2D wavelike
network (Figure 3b,c).
The parallel 2D layers are extended into a 3D supramolecular architecture
by hydrogen bonds between carboxylic groups, amide, and coordinated
water molecules (Figure S4). The corresponding
hydrogen-bonding data are given in Table S13.

[Ni(3-bptpa)(5-AIP)]·2H2O (5)
To further investigate the effect of the substituents of V-type
dicarboxylates, amido in 5-H2AIP was selected instead of
nitro in 5-H2NIP in the synthetic process. A 2D double-layer
structure based on two [Ni(5-AIP)] honeycomblike sheets and [Ni(3-bptpa)]
zigzag chains is obtained. Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that
the Ni ion in the asymmetric unit of 5 is bound with
two nitrogen atoms of two 3-bptpa [Ni–N 2.059(2) and 2.194(2)
Å], one nitrogen atom of 5-AIP [Ni–N 2.141(2) Å],
and three carboxylic oxygen atoms from two 5-AIP anions [Ni–O
2.023(2)–2.178(2) Å] (Figure 4a). The bond angles around the Ni(II) ion
are in the range of 61.55(6)–172.60(8) Å.

of a Ni(II) ion in 5.
(b) Honey 2D [Ni(5-AIP)] subunit with 63 topology. (c)
Schematic view of the 2D (3,5)-connected double layer.

3-bptpa ligands in complex 5 coordinate with
adjacent
Ni ions to generate a 1D zigzag chain with the Ni–Ni distance
of 16.889 Å. 5-AIP acts as a 3-connected linker to bridge three
Ni(II) ions forming a honeycomblike 2D sheet (Figure 4b). The above subunits are connected to each
other to form a 2D double-layer structure (Figure 4c). Finally, the parallel 2D layers are extended
into a 3D supramolecular architecture by hydrogen bonds between the
amide of 3-bptpa and the amino of 5-AIP, carboxylic groups, and lattice
water molecules (Figure S5). The corresponding
hydrogen-bonding data of complex 9 are given in Table S14.

[Ni2(OH)(3-bptpa)2(1,3,5-BTC)]·DMA·5H2O (6)
To further study the effect of
the groups of V-type dicarboxylates, carboxyl in 1,3,5-BTC was selected
instead of amino in 5-H2AIP in the synthetic process, and
a 3D complex for 6 based on Ni2(OH) clusters
was obtained. The asymmetric unit of 6 consists of two
Ni(II) ions, one 1,3,5-BTC anion, two 3-bptpa ligands, one μ2-OH, one DMA, and five lattice water molecules. As illustrated
in Figure 5a, Ni1/Ni2 ions are six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms
of two 3-bptpa ligands [Ni–N 2.070(4)–2.093(4) Å],
three carboxylic oxygen atoms from two 1,3,5-BTC anions [Ni–O
1.996(2)–2.241(3) Å], and one oxygen atom of μ2-OH [Ni–O 1.996(2) and 2.011(2) Å]. The bond angles
around Ni(II) cations vary from 60.63(9) to 177.02(13)°.

environment of a Ni(II) ion in 6.
(b) 63 network based on [Ni2(OH)]2 nodes and

framework.

In complex 6, one
μ2-OH links Ni1 and Ni2 cations
to form a bimetallic Ni2(OH) subunit with the Ni–Ni
separation of 3.531 Å. Each
1,3,5-BTC anion acts as a 3-connected linker to bridge three Ni2(OH) subunits forming a 2D honeycomblike network (Figure 5b). 3-bptpa ligands
link the above parallel 2D networks forming a 3D framework, which
is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the amide, carboxylic groups,
and lattice water molecules (Figures 5c and S6). The corresponding
hydrogen-bonding data are given in Table S15. Topologically, 1,3,5-BTC and the bimetallic Ni2(OH)
subunit can be regarded as 3- and 5-connected nodes. Thus, complex 6 can be classified as a (3,5)-connected binodal hms topological net with a Schläfli symbol of {63}{69·8} (Figure 5d).

[Cu(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)]·3H2O
(7) and
[Cu(3-bptpa)(1,3,5-HBTC)] (9)
To investigate
the effect of metal ions, Cu(II) ions in 7 and 9 were selected instead of Ni(II) in 3 and 6 in the synthetic processes. As a result, two similar 2D
networks of 7 and 9 with different structural
details were obtained. Herein, only complex 7 is selected
as a representative example for detailed structural description. The
asymmetric unit of 7 consists of one Cu(II) ion, one
5-MIP anion, one 3-bptpa ligand, and three lattice water molecules.
As shown in Figure 6a, the Cu(II) center is five-coordinated with distorted trigonal
bipyramid coordination geometry: two nitrogen atoms belonging to two
3-bptpa ligands and three carboxylic oxygen atoms from three 5-MIP
anions. The Cu–O bond lengths are in the range of 1.949(3)–2.223(3)
Å. The Cu–N bond lengths are 2.010(4) and 2.027(4) Å.
The bond angles around the Cu(II) cation are in the range of 52.24(11)–176.64(15)°.

(b) 2D network based on (3-bptpa)2 and (5-MIP)2 double linkers. (c)
(4,4)-connected 2D network based on bimetallic Cu2 subunits.

In complex 7, two Cu ions are linked
by a pair of
carboxylic groups to form a Cu2 bimetallic subunit with
the Cu–Cu distance of 3.965 Å. The adjacent bimetallic
subunits are connected by pairs of 5-MIP anions to generate a 1D double-chain
(Figure 6b). The parallel
double chains are further linked by pairs of 3-bptpa ligands forming
a 4-connected 2D network based on bimetallic nodes. Finally, a 3D
supramolecular structure extended by hydrogen bonds between the amide,
carboxylic groups, and lattice water molecules is obtained (Figure S7). The corresponding hydrogen-bonding
data are given in Table S16. The structural
details and the corresponding hydrogen-bonding data of complex 9 are given in Figure S8 and Table S17.

[Cu(3-bptpa)(5-AIP)(H2O)0.25]·H2O (8)
Complex 8 is a 2D
double-layer structure, which was constructed from two 4-connected
single-node sheets and bridging coordinated water molecules. As illustrated
in Figure 7a, the Cu(II)
center is six-coordinated by two nitrogen atoms of two 3-bptpa ligands
[Cu–N 2.017(3) and 2.025(3) Å], three carboxylic oxygen
atoms from two 5-AIP anions [Cu–O 1.990(2)–2.438(3)
Å], and one oxygen atom of the coordinated water molecule [Cu–O
2.453(2) Å]. The bond angles around Cu(II) cations vary from
58.44(9) to 161.99(12)°.

in 8.
(b) 2D double layer based on two (4,4)-connected grids and extended

The two carboxylic groups of a 5-AIP anion in 8 adopt
single-dentate and chelating coordination modes to bridge Cu(II) ions
forming a 1D [Cu(5-AIP)] linear chain with the Cu–Cu distance
of 9.925 Å. 3-bptpa ligands link the parallel [Cu(5-AIP)] chains
to generate a 2D 4-connected network based on single-metallic nodes.
The parallel networks are extended into a double-layer structure by
μ2-coordinated water molecules (Figure 7b,c). Finally, complex 8 displays 3D supramolecular architecture extended by hydrogen
bonds between the amide of 3-bptpa, the amino of 5-AIP, carboxylic
groups, and coordinated/lattice water molecules (Figure S9). The corresponding hydrogen-bonding data are given
in Table S18.

Effect of the Polycarboxylates
and Metal Ions on the Structures
of the Title Complexes
To investigate the effect of the coordinated
angles of benzenedicarboxylic acids on the structures of the title
complexes, the same center metal ion Ni(II) and linear N-donor ligand
(3-bptpa) were used in 1 and 2. While the
benzenedicarboxylic acids were selected from 1,2-H2BDC
(with the coordinated angle of 60°) and H2IP (with
the coordinated angle of 120°), the title complexes of 1 and 2 display a discrete bimetallic structure
and a 1D ladderlike band (Figures 1 and 2). To study the effect
of the 5-site substituents of benzenecarboxylic acids on the structures
of the Ni-(3-bptpa) system, −H (for H2IP in 2), −CH3 (for 5-H2MIP in 3), −NO2 (for 5-H2NIP in 4), −NH2 (for 5-H2AIP in 5), and −COOH (for 1,3,5-H3BTC in 6) were selected in the benzenecarboxylic acids in the synthetic
process (Chart S1a). As a result, the structures
of the corresponding complexes show 1D ladderlike bands of 2 and 3, a (4,4)-connected single-node sheet of 4, a honeycomblike 2D double layer of 5, and
a (3,5)-connected 3D framework of 6 (Figure 8 and Chart S1). A further structural analysis shows that there are several
differences between the complexes of 1–6. (i) Although the coordinated geometries of Ni(II) ions in 1–6 are all octahedron with two N atoms
of 3-bptpa and four N/O from benzenecarboxylates, the two N atoms
of 3-bptpa are in cis-modes in 1, 4, 5 and trans-modes in 2, 3, 6 (Chart S1b). (ii) The subunits of metal–polycarboxylates are
discrete in 1, bimetallic loops in 2/3, a 1D linear chain in 4, and honeycomblike
2D 63 sheets in 5/6 (Chart S1c). The Ni–Ni distances linked
by benzenecarboxylates are 7.75 Å for 2; 7.92 Å
for 3; 10.16 Å for 4; 7.76, 8.81, and
8.99 Å for 5; and 8.25, 8.31, and 9.65 Å for 6 (Chart S1c). The binuclear Ni–Ni
distances linked by two coordinated water molecules and two carboxylates
in 1 and one hydroxyl and one carboxylate in 2 are 2.89 and 3.53 Å, respectively. (iii) The subunits of metal–bptpa
are the terminal group in 1, 1D zigzag chains in 2/3, 1D helix in 4, and 1D zigzag
chains in 5/6. The corresponding Ni–Ni
distances linked by 3-bptpa are 16.07Å for 2, 16.29
Å for 3, 13.18 Å for 4, 16.89
Å for 5, and 16.87 Å for 6 (Chart S1d). The configurations of the pyridine
ring and amide oxygen, amide oxygen and amide oxygen, amide oxygen
and the pyridine ring of 3-bptpa are in trans-, cis-, and trans-modes for 1; trans-, cis-, and cis-modes for 2/3; trans-, trans-, and cis-modes for 4; trans-, cis-, and cis-modes for 5; trans-, trans-, and trans-modes for 6, respectively
(Chart S1d). The above comparisons show
that the carboxylates play an important role in tuning the structures
of the title complexes.

Figure 8 Schematic view of the effect of carboxylates
on the structures
of 1–6.

To study the effect of the metal ions on the structures of the
Ni-(3-bptpa) system, Cu(II) ions in 7–9 were selected instead of Ni(II) in 1–6 in the synthetic process. As a result, when 1,2-H2BDC,
H2IP, and H2NIP were used, only amorphous unknown
powders were obtained, which is not suitable for X-ray diffraction.
While Cu(II) ions were selected instead of Ni(II) in 3 (5-H2MIP), 5 (5-H2AIP), and 6 (1,3,5-H3BTC) in the synthetic process (Chart S2a), a 2D (4,4)-connected grid of 7 based on bimetallic nodes, a 2D double-layer structure of 8 derived from two (4,4)-connected single-node sheets, and
a 2D (4,4)-connected grid of 9 based on bimetallic nodes
were generated (Figure 9 and Chart S2). In addition, some obvious
differences of 7–9 are found compared
with 3, 5, and 6. (i) The coordinated
geometries of Cu(II) ions in 7–9 are
triangular bipyramid, octahedron, and triangular bipyramid, respectively,
and the two N atoms of 3-bptpa are all in trans-modes
(Chart S2b). (ii) The subunits of metal–polycarboxylates
are 1D double chains in 7 and 9 and a 1D
linear chain in 8 (Chart S2c). The Cu–Cu distances linked by benzenecarboxylates are 8.04
Å and 10.01 Å for 7, 9.93 Å for 8, 7.79 Å, and 10.02 Å for 9 (Chart S2c). The binuclear Cu–Cu distances
linked by two carboxylates in 7 and 9 are
3.97 and 4.01 Å, respectively. (iii) The subunits of metal–bptpa
are all 1D zigzag chains in 7–9,
and the corresponding Cu–Cu distances linked by 3-bptpa are
17.02 Å for 7, 16.97 Å for 8,
and 16.69 Å for 9 (Chart S2d). The corresponding configurations of the pyridine ring and amide
oxygen, amide oxygen and amide oxygen, amide oxygen and the pyridine
ring of 3-bptpa are all cis-, cis-, and trans-modes for 7–9, respectively (Chart S2d). The
above structural details are different from those of 3, 5, and 6, which show that the metal ions
[from Ni(II) to Cu(II)] play an important role in tuning the structures
of the title complexes.

Figure 9 Schematic view of the effect of metal ions [from
Ni(II) to Cu(II)]
on the structures of 3 and 7, 5 and 8, and 6 and 9.

To further explore the effect of the metal ions
on the structures
of the 3-bptpa system, H2MIP was selected as an anion ligand
and different metal ions of Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ were used as research
objects, as shown in Figure S10 and Chart S2. Our group has reported three complexes based on Zn2+ or Cd2+ or Co2+ and 3-bptpa and H2MIP, namely, a 2D (4,4)-connected single-metallic-node grid of [Zn(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)]
(CP1), a 3D NaCl-type framework of [Cd(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)]·4H2O (CP2), and a 2D (4,4)-connected bimetallic-node
sheet of [Co(3-bptpa)(5-MIP)]·2H2O (CP3) (Chart S2).11b,12a Some obvious differences of CP1–CP3, 3, and 7 are found in the further analysis.
(i) With a decrease in the radius of metal ions (from Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ to Zn2+), the coordinated geometries are changed from octahedron (for CP2, CP3, and 3), triangular bipyramid
(for 7) to tetrahedron (for CP1) (Chart S2b). (ii) The subunits of metal–polycarboxylates
are a 1D linear chain in CP1; a bimetallic loop in 3; and 1D double chains in 7, CP2, and CP3 (Chart S2c). (iii)
The subunits of metal–bptpa are all 1D chains in CP1–CP3, 3, and 7 but
with the different metal–metal distances linked by 3-bptpa
(14.88Å for CP1, 16.93 Å for CP2, and 17.11 Å for CP3) (Chart S2d). The corresponding configurations of the thiophene sulfur
and amide oxygen of 3-bptpa are all in cis-modes
for 3, 7, CP2, and CP3 but in trans-mode for CP1 (Chart S2d). The above differences of the structural
details further demonstrate the effect of metal ion on the structures
of the complexes. In addition, the bimetallic nodes and (3-bptpa)2 double linkers are found in the topological structures of 6, 7, 9, CP2, and CP3, whereas the other complexes possess single-metallic nodes.
In summary, the coordinated angle (from 60° of 1,2-H2BDC to 120° of H2IP), space steric hindrance (from
−H of H2IP, −CH3 of 5-H2MIP to −NO2 of 5-H2NIP), and the type
of coordinated dentate (from −NH2 of 5-H2AIP to −COOH of 1,3,5-H3BTC) of carboxylates, as
well as the radius (from Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ to Zn2+) and coordinated characters
of metal ions, all affect the structures of complexes.

IR, Powder
X-ray Diffraction, and Thermal Stability Analyses
of the Title Complexes
The IR spectra of complexes 1–9 with the frequency range of 500–4000
cm–1 are shown in Figure S11. The broad bands in the area of 3600–3250 cm–1 represent OH stretching modes within the free and coordinated water
molecules or the formation of hydrogen-bonding interactions.16a The absorptions observed in the range 3250–3100
cm–1 in complexes 1–9 can be attributed to the νN–H stretching
band of 3-bptpa ligands.16b The weak absorption
peaks of the −CH3 group of 5-MIP in 3 and 7 are observed at 2918 and 2926 cm–1, respectively.16c The absorptions observed
at 1693 cm–1 in 9 show that one of
the carboxylic groups of 1,3,5-BTC is not deprotonated.16a On the other hand, there is no absorption peak
between 1730 and 1670 cm–1, indicating that all
carboxyl groups of the organic moieties in 1–8 are deprotonated.16a The absorption
bands at about 1365 and 1548 cm–1 arise from the
nitro groups of 5-NIP in 4.16d The peaks observed in the range of 1660–1600 cm–1 for these complexes are assigned to the stretching bands of νas(COO−), whereas the peaks observed at about 1390 cm–1 can be assigned to the stretching bands of νs(COO−). The skeletal vibrations of phenyl and pyridyl
rings fall in the range of 1590–1430 cm–1. The strong bands in the range of 690–730 cm–1 can be attributed to the ν(C–N) stretching
of the N-heterocyclic rings of the 3-bptpa ligands.

The phase
purity of these nine complexes was confirmed by comparison of their
experimental powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns with the reference
powder diffractogram (calculated on the basis of single-crystal X-ray
diffraction data) (Figure S12). The as-synthesized
patterns are in good agreement with the corresponding simulated ones,
indicating the good phase purity of the samples. The differences in
intensity are due to the preferred orientation of the powder samples.
The thermal stability of complexes 1–9 was investigated by thermogravimetry under a N2 atmosphere
at 20.0 mL min–1 and 10 °C min–1 using bulk phase materials. As shown in Figure S13, the weight losses of 2.35% (calcd 2.02%) for 1, 9.19% (calcd 8.98%) for 2, 8.49% (calcd 8.78%) for 3, 2.66% (calcd 2.95%) for 4, 5.89% (calcd 6.02%)
for 5, 7.98% (calcd 7.71%) for 6, 8.59%
(calcd 8.71%) for 7, and 3.51% (calcd 3.82%) for 8 in the temperature ranges of 86–135 °C for 1, 105–201 °C for 2, 114–156
°C for 3, 230–267 °C for 4, 140–243 °C for 5, 103–184 °C
for 6, 95–284 °C for 7, and
130–227 °C for 8, respectively, are attributed
to the release of the water molecules. The weight loss of 7.14% (calcd
7.46%) for 6 at the temperature ranging from 250 to 330
°C belongs to the departure of DMA. The title complexes can be
stable up to 300 °C for 1, 367 °C for 2, 365 °C for 3, 357 °C for 4, 386 °C for 5, 369 °C for 6,
285 °C for 7, 306 °C for 8, and
323 °C for 9, following the decomposition of the
framework. The different decomposition temperatures may be due to
the different structures and constituents of the complexes.

Photoluminescent
Properties
The luminescent properties
of 1–9 in the solid state at room
temperature were measured. As shown in Figure 10, the nine complexes exhibit similar blue
emission with different intensities. Upon excitation at 320 nm, the
emissions of these complexes are at 461, 413, 460, 424, 416, 458,
414, 404, and 413 nm, respectively. Compared with the emission of
3-bptpa (λem = 439 nm), the emissions of the title
complexes exhibit red shifts of ca. 22, 21, and 19 nm for 1, 3 and 6 and blue shifts of ca. 26, 15,
23, 25, 35, and 26 nm for 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.
The carboxylate ligands show very weak π* → n transitions
and contribute little to the photoluminescence of the title complexes.17 Thus, the emissions of the title complexes may
be assigned to intraligand charge transitions of 3-bptpa. The varying
degrees of blue/red shifts are probably caused by the coordination
of 3-bptpa with the metal centers, different coordination environments
of 3-bptpa, and structures of the title complexes.18

Electrochemical Activities
In the title complexes, 3 and 7, 5 and 8, and 6 and 9 were constructed from the same N-ligand
and carboxylates but different metal ions as electrochemical sites
[Ni(II) for 3, 5, and 6; Cu(II)
for complexes 7, 8, and 9]
(Chart S3). Thus, to explore the effect
of metal ions on the electrochemical behavior and electrocatalytic
activity, the complexes 3-, 7-, 5-, 8-, 6-, and 9-bulk-modified
carbon paste electrodes (n-CPE, n = 3, 7, 5, 8, 6, and 9) are prepared according to our previous report,
and their electrochemical behaviors are researched in 0.01 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous
solution.19Figure S14 shows the cyclic voltammograms of 3-, 5–9-CPE at different scan rates in the
same potential range of −100–700 mV for 3, 5, and 6 and −500 to 500 mV for 7–9. One pair of reversible redox peaks
with the oxidation peaks at 0.195, 0.189, 0.180, −0.100, −0.105,
and −0.080 V for 3, 5–9-CPE, respectively, and the corresponding reduction peaks
at 0.287, 0.298, 0.290, 0.050, 0.010, and 0.020 V can be clearly observed.
At the scan rate of 100 mV s–1, the relative mean
peak potentials [E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2] are 241, 244,
235, −25, −47, and −30 mV, respectively, which
may be attributed to the redox of NiIII/NiII and CuII/CuI.13 With the increased scan rates from 20 to 300 mV s–1, although the peak-to-peak separation between the corresponding
cathodic and anodic peaks increases, the mean peak potentials do not
change. The peak currents are proportional to the scan rates, which
prove that the redox of n-CPEs is the surface-confined
process.19

In the 0.01 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution,
the electrocatalytic activities of 3, 5–9-CPEs toward oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) and reduction
of H2O2, NO2–,
and BrO3– were investigated. To the best
of our knowledge, there is no obvious response of the bare CPE for
AA, H2O2, NO2–,
and BrO3–.19 With the addition of AA, NO2–, BrO3–, and H2O2, the oxidation
peak currents of 6-CPE and reduction peak currents of 3-CPE, 5-CPE, and 7-CPE increase
at the corresponding peak potentials of about 320, 250, 220, and −110
mV, respectively (Figure 11). The results display that 6-, 3-, 5-, and 7-CPEs can act as effective
electrochemical catalysts for the oxidation of AA and reduction of
NO2–, BrO3–, and H2O2, respectively. The system comparisons
are shown in Chart S3 and Figure S15. NO2– can be electrocatalytically reduced by
all of the three Ni-based complexes (3, 5, and 6) and one Cu-complex (9). BrO3– can be electrocatalytically reduced by
complexes 5 and 6. H2O2 can be electrocatalytically reduced only by three Cu-complexes (7, 8, and 9), and AA can be electrocatalytically
oxidized only by one Ni-complex (6). Different electrochemical
activities may be due to the different structures and constituents
of the complexes.13

ascorbic acid, and hydrogen peroxide. Scan rate: 100 mV s–1.

Conclusions
In
summary, by tuning the polycarboxylates and metal ions, we have
successfully obtained nine 0D → 3D complexes from a thiophene-containing
bis-pyridyl-bis-amide ligand under hydrothermal/solvothermal reactions.
The title complexes display from a 0D binuclear cluster (for 1), 1D ladderlike bands (for 2 and 3), a (4,4)-connected 2D sheet (for 4), a honeycomblike
double layer (for 5), a 3,5-connected 3D framework (for 6), a bimetallic-node 2D network (for 7), a 5-connected
double layer (for 8) to a (4,4)-connected 2D grid (for 9). The versatile structural features of the title complexes
indicate that the polycarboxylates and metal ions play an important
role in the construction of metal–organic complexes. The different
fluorescent properties and electrochemical activities for ascorbic
acid, hydrogen peroxide, nitrites, and bromates of the title complexes
show that the properties of the target complexes can be adjusted by
the rational design of the starting materials.

X-Ray Crystallography
The X-ray intensity data for 1–9 were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX
II diffractometer, and the structures were solved by direct method
and difference Fourier syntheses and refined by full-matrix least-squares
techniques.21 Absorption corrections were
applied using a multiscan technique. The nonhydrogen atoms were refined
with anisotropic temperature parameters, and all H atoms of the organic
ligands were positioned geometrically and allowed to ride on their
parent atoms with isotropic displacement parameters. The H atoms of
water molecules were located from difference Fourier maps and refined
as riding atoms. In complex 6, the H2B and H5B atoms
of water, attached to O2W and O5W, respectively, are not involved
in hydrogen bonds according to the hydrogen-bonding scheme. In complex 7, a close contact [3.103(13) Å] between O3W and its
symmetry-related equivalent atom (at 1 – x, −y −z) indicates
a hydrogen-bonding interaction between them. Therefore, one of the
H atoms of O3W should be disordered in two half-occupied sites due
to the restraint of the symmetry center, one (H3B) involved in this
hydrogen bond and the other (H3C) not in any hydrogen-bonding interaction.
Their occupancy factors are 0.5. The occupancy factor of O(2W) in 8 is 0.25. The amide of 3-bptpa in 9 is disordered
(C11 and O2), and their occupancy factors are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively.
The crystal data and structure refinement details for complexes 1–9 are summarized in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and
angles are listed in Tables S1–S9.
