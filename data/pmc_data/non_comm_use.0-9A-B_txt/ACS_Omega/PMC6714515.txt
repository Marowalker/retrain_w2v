A methodological
framework implementing laboratory activities and
life cycle assessment is presented and applied to determine which
parameters should be considered to develop biobased rigid polyurethane
foams for thermal insulation with improved environmental performances when compared to their
fossil counterparts. The framework was applied to six partially biobased
(produced from bio-based polyols obtained from azelaic acid and/or
lignin) and one fossil-based formulations. A comprehensive set of
impact assessment categories was investigated including uncertainty
and sensitivity analysis. Results proved that physical characteristics
such as thermal conductivity and density are the most important variable
to be optimized to guarantee better environmental performances of
biobased polyurethane rigid foams for thermal insulation. Care should
be taken with reference to ozone depletion potential, marine eutrophication,
and abiotic depletion potential because of the uncertainty related
to their results. The methylene diphenyl diisocyanate and foam production
process were identified as the major sources of impacts. Overall environmental
superiority of biobased polyurethanes cannot always be claimed with
respect to their fossil counterpart.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The scarcity of natural
resources and environmental impacts related
to the overexploitation of fossil fuels is central to international
debate. The United Nations (UN), in 2015, adopted an agenda for the
development of more sustainable production processes also known as
“Goal 12” of the Sustainable Development Goals1 by setting specific targets to support the circulation
of new materials based on renewable feedstock with improved environmental
performances. On the same line, the EU commission has launched the
circular economy action plan “Closing the loop”2 aimed at developing an economy based on recycling,
recovery, and reuse with clear attention to the management of natural
resources. Among the provisions derived from this action plan, the
limitation on the production and marketing of single-use plastic and
of the use of nonrenewable resources raised the interest of the market
and is considered fundamental for the reduction of negative environmental
impacts.3 The reasons for this interest
are manifold: plastics play a fundamental role in the current society,
with application in almost all areas of our daily life; however, the
actual production system and market presents several environmental
issues ranging from low recycling rates and high landfilled fraction,
without neglecting the dispersion in oceans and the use of hazardous
additives.2

In this context, the
development of new plastic materials with
better environmental performances when compared to the traditional
fossil-based counterpart is considered a priority.3 The research community has widely investigated the use
of renewable feedstock4 for the production
of biobased plastics so that material such as polylactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates,
starch plastics, biobased polyethylene (PE), partly bio-based polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), and partly bio-based polyurethane (PU) are already
established in the market.5−7

Despite that the use of
biomass is considered to be promising in
plastic production because of its renewability and its relatively
low price, recent studies based on the application of life cycle assessment
(LCA) methodology proved that such materials cannot always guarantee
better environmental performances when compared to their fossil counterparts.4 LCA, as defined by ISO 14040 standard, is the
compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental
impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle,8 allowing a comprehensive view on the related potential
impacts. Tsiropoulos et al.9 presented
a comparison between biobased high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and
biobased PET with the fossil-based counterparts, reporting that biobased
materials guarantee to save in nonrenewable energy use and had smaller
greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, but on the other hand increased
the net water consumption and emission of eutrophic substances associated
with the application of fertilizers during biomass cultivation. Chen
et al.10 provided a comparative analysis
between fossil-based PET and PET containing biomass from wood and
corn residues investigating climate change, fossil resource depletion,
acidification, and ozone depletion impact assessment categories. Formulations
containing biomass scored better environmental performances in climate
change and fossil resource depletion but they showed higher impacts
in acidification and ozone depletion. Semba et al.11 and Adom et al.,12 analyzing
biobased PE, succinic acid, isobutanol, and PET, confirmed that the
use of renewable feedstock generally improved the environmental performances
of biobased plastics in the climate change impact assessment categories.
Helling and Russell13 focused their assessment
on water withdrawals related to different polyols, showing a higher
consumption for biobased ones and also a great variability between
different feedstocks.

Despite the great attention paid to the
investigation of environmental
performances of biobased plastics, no study related to the LCA of
biobased PU foams have been published yet, neither studies on their
comparison with fossil-based PU foams.7 From the literature review, it emerges that research on biobased
PU foams has been more focused on the development of new formulations
based on the use of vegetable oil- or lignin-derived polyols.14−18

Considering that PU foams are used in a wide range of applications15 and that it is the fifth most demanded polymer
in Europe (3.74 million tons),19 to guarantee
the sustainability of PU industries in the context of the framework
of the circular economy,2 there is a clear
need to investigate the environmental performances of new biobased
PU formulations and identify potential pathways to reduce their potential
negative environmental impacts.15

In light of this lack, the objective of this study, through the
development of a framework integrating laboratory testing and LCA,
is to determine which parameters should be considered to develop biobased
PU foams with improved environmental performances when compared to
their fossil counterparts. The biobased foams under study have been
prepared after extensive formulation optimization to achieve physical
performances at least equal to the fossil-based reference material.

Considering the wide range of applications of PU polymers, this
study focuses on PU rigid foams used as the building insulation material.
These foams have been prepared starting from bio-based polyols, obtained
from azelaic acid (AA) and/or lignin. Seven PU formulations were developed
and investigated in this study: T01 is based on traditional fossil
polyol, B01/B02/B03 are based on AA derived polyol, and BL01/BL02/BL03
are based on AA-derived polyol and contain liquefied kraft lignin
from softwood.

For the assessment of the environmental performances,
considering
the conflicting results presented by other references published on
other bio-based plastic materials (e.g., climate change vs eutrophication),
a comprehensive set of indicators has been used.9−12

2 Results
and Discussion
Foams’ density and thermal conductivity
are reported in Table 1, as PU_density and
PU_lambda, respectively. It can be noted that density varied within
31 and 46 kg/m3 range. In particular, the density of foam
B01 has been made deliberately higher (46 kg/m3) in order
to have acceptable dimensional stability; indeed, because the polyol
used here had low functionality (=2), an acceptable dimensional stability
can be obtained only increasing foam density. The thermal conductivity
of bio-based foams is very similar to their fossil-based counterpart
(T01) except for BL01. This can be due to the higher polyol acidity
because of the higher amount of acid catalyst (3%) used in the liquefaction
process. This higher acidity negatively interfered with polymerization
catalysts (i.e., amine), leading to a worse cellular structure and,
therefore, as it is well known,37 to higher
thermal conductivity values (as in the case of BL03).

The results of the impact assessment are shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Results of
the life cycle impact assessment. All the results are
referred at the functional unit.

With reference to B01, B03, BL01, and BL02, results showed that
these formulations had worse environmental performances in all of
the impact assessment categories under study if compared to the similar
biobased foams (B series contain AA-derived polyols and BL series
contain lignin-based polyols). The reason of these results is the
larger amount of reactants required to produce B01, due to its slightly
higher density, B03 and BL02, due to their slightly higher conductivity,
and BL0, due to its higher conductivity and density.

The B02
formulation, on the other hand, scores the best performances
with the following environmental impact reductions when compared to
the performances of the fossil-based formulation (T01): CC (−30%),
ODP (−14%), POF (−31%), AE (−28%), FE (−44%),
ME (−24%), ADPFF (−31%) and ADP (−8%). Finally,
BL03 resulted to have higher impacts with respect to T01 in the ODP
(+10%) category but have lower impacts in the others: CC (−32%),
POF (−33%), AE (−29%), FE (−43%), ME (−11%),
ADPFF (−36%), and ADP (−16%).

The CC,
POF, AE, and ADPFF impact assessment categories resulted
to be strongly influenced by the use of nonrenewable resources related
to the application of MDI in all of the biobased PU formulations and
the use of fossil-based polyol in the case of T01. In these categories,
considering that the use of MDI increased per unit of polyol (from
an MDI/polyol ratio of 1.64 for T01 to 4.40 for B03 and 3.97 for BL03,
depending on the nOH of the polyol), the bio-based
formulations scored performances similar to those of T01.

The
ODP, FE, and ADP categories resulted to be more influenced
by the impacts deriving from “foam production” and “polyol
production” life cycle stages. In these cases, considering
that impacts were directly proportional to the quantity of materials,
formulations with better physical properties resulted to be favored.

The ME category resulted to be more influenced by the impacts deriving
from end of life management (in particular the disposal in landfill)
followed by the production process and use of aniline in the MDI’s
production process. Also, in this case, the reason of such results
was directly related to the physical properties of the PU formulations.

Focusing on the comparison between the biobased PU formulations
that presented overall better performances, B02 and BL03, the introduction
of lignin (considering both the production and liquefaction processes)
does not make the polyol more environmentally sustainable than the
one derived from AA. This trend is confirmed by the contribution analysis;
the overall contribution of polyol, lignin, and liquefaction to the
impacts of BL03 is higher than the contribution of polyol in B02 in
all of the impact assessment categories considered.

Focusing
on a wider analysis of the literature, in one hand, the
results of this study partially confirm those already published. This
is the case of the reduction of impacts guaranteed by biobased formulations
in the CC category which are consistent with the results obtained
by Tsiropoulos et al.9 (bio-HDPE and bio-PET),
Adom et al.12 (bio-PE, succinic acid and
isobutanol), Semba et al.,11 and Chen et
al.10 (bio-PET). Results in the ADPFF category
confirm the conclusion of Chen et al.10 and Adom et al.12

On the other
hand, the increase of impacts in ODP and AE reported
by Chen, et al.10 and in the case of ME
reported by Tsiropoulos, et al.9 are not
confirmed in this study. This discrepancy is due to the different
functional units adopted; in those studies, in fact, impacts were
reported per unit of mass without considering the physical properties
(e.g., density and conductivity) which are instead fundamental for
the use of PU in building insulation.

As already mentioned in Section 2, the sensitivity
analysis has been performed to identify
the most influencing parameters among AAperc, lignin perc, reaction_PandL,
reaction_MDI, PU_density, and PU_lambda (Table 3).

a High values mean
a greater relevance
of the parameter for the indicated impact category.

Results proved that physical properties
of the foam (PU_lambda
and PU_density) linearly affected the quantity of material required
and therefore indirectly affected the impacts in all of the impact
assessment categories. Among other parameters, only reaction_PandL
and reaction_MDI showed the relevant value of sensitivity, in particular
for the impact categories ODP, FE, ME, ADPFF, and ADP. Parameters
related to the formulation of PU (AAperc and lignin perc) have a small
influence on the final results.

Results of the study proved
that the impacts, in the case of biobased
PU formulation, were more influenced by the amount of foam required
to satisfy the functional unit, rather than its formulation. For this
reason, when developing a new formulation from renewable feedstock,
it is important to achieve physical performances at least equal to
the fossil-based reference material.

Uncertainty, that is related at the secondary
data used in this
study, was higher in the formulation containing lignin (BL03), whereas
T01 and B02 showed similar values of coefficient of variation (CV).

Considering the results of uncertainty analysis, impacts of B02
were confirmed to be lower than T01 (without overlap of error intervals)
in the categories CC, POF, AE, and ADPFF, while impacts of BL03 were
confirmed to be lower only in the CC and ADPFF. With reference to
ODP, FE, ME, and ADP, due to an overlap in the 95% confidence interval,
reduction in environmental impacts cannot be always confirmed.

Considering that uncertainty resulted to be influenced by the use
of secondary data, the collection of primary data becomes a priority
for future study and to confirm if formulations such as B02 and BL03
can guarantee environmental performance improvements when compared
to T01.

3 Conclusions
The overall results of
LCA show that formulation containing azelaic-acid
derived polyol (B02) and lignin-based polyol (BL03) can score reductions
of impacts in all the of the impact categories when compared to their
fossil counterpart (T01). B02 presented better overall performances
with a reduction of impacts between −8 and −44%. However,
considering the results of uncertainty analysis, reduction in environmental
impacts (absolute term) was confirmed only in the categories CC, POF,
AE, and ADPFF for B02 and CC and ADPFF for BL03. Such results should
be confirmed by improving the use of primary data to limit the uncertainty
of results. Overall results also show that the introduction of lignin
is not always preferable to the use of only AA-derived polyol. In
addition, lignin-containing foams are characterized by greater uncertainty.

For a further improvement of the environmental performances, a
reduction of the MDI/polyol ratio in the biobased formulations is
desirable (i.e., use of low nOH polyols is preferable),
while the significant contribution of the fossil polyol justifies
the efforts made to replace it with a renewable counterpart. Impacts
related to the foam production process are strictly related to the
quantity of foam required, for this reason, obtaining adequate physical
performance is essential, in particular, lowest thermal conductivity
at the lowest possible density.

The sensitivity analysis proved
that the density and conductivity
of the foam are the key parameters that influence the overall impacts.
This is further confirmation that an introduction of renewable feedstock
end in itself is not sustainable if not supported by the achievement
of physical properties similar to fossil-based foams.

The results
of this study confirm those presented in the literature
for the categories CC and ADPFF, whereas for the others categories
(ODP, AE, and ME), the results are only partially verified. In fact,
the expression of the functional unit according to the insulating
properties of the foam highlights that the improving of physical performance
lead to a reduction in the required foam amount to be used, which
is reflected in a proportional decrease in impacts.

Results
of this study support the development of future research,
indeed there is a clear need to improve the quality of data related
to the production of biomass used as feedstock to confirm the results
scored by biobased PU in ODP, FE, ME, and ADP categories.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Methodological
Framework
To investigate the objective of the study, the
general structure
of LCA studies8 has been adapted to better
integrate the laboratory activities implemented in the development
of the new biobased PU formulas.

LCA studies are structured
in 4 phases. The goal and scope definition are implemented to clarify
the objective of the study, to determine the main methodological boundaries
(e.g., impact assessment categories to be investigated and data quality
criteria for data collection) as well as the life cycle processes
to be included in the analysis (also referred as system boundaries).
Another fundamental step of this phase is the definition of the so-called
functional unit which is the measuring unit that quantifies the function
of the product under study. Its definition is very important to allow
for comparisons of different products with similar functions (e.g.,
PU rigid foams based on fossil or biomass). The inventory analysis
phase includes the data collection and modeling of all of the input
and outputs of material, energy, and other elementary flows that can
cause potential environmental impacts. In this study, the inventory
phase is supported by the collection of primary data generated through
laboratory activities that allowed the collection of relevant information
on the bio-based and fossil-based PU formulas. The outputs of the
foam production and foam characterization, which included the quantification
of mechanical and physical properties, were therefore used as input
to inventory analysis and modeling and the following impact assessment
phase. In this part of the study, inventory data are characterized
into potential environmental impacts. Finally, the interpretation
phase is applied to discuss the validity of the results concerning
the goal and scope of the study and to identify the criteria (e.g.,
life cycle stages, mechanical and physical parameters) to be considered
in the development of new biobased PU foams with improved environmental
performances. Results of the interpretation stage were used as inputs
to guide the development of the new formulations in the laboratory
activities.

4.2 Goal and Scope Definition
The goal
of the LCA study is to compare the environmental performances of the
new biobased PU formulations used for building insulation, containing
different quantities and types of renewable feedstocks (polyols and
lignin). To guarantee a solid comparison of the performances of the
new bio-based formulas with the fossil-based one, it was decided to
use the product category rules (PCR) for insulation materials set
by The International EPD System.20 These
rules are a set of defined sectorial parameters and requirements,
determined by the market in a participatory process, that standardizes
the application of LCA of a specific product.

According to the
selected PCR, the functional unit, referred also as the declared unit,
is defined as the amount of foam needed to achieve 1 m2·K/W of thermal resistance R, defined as 1  where λ is the
thermal conductivity
[W/(K·m)] and L is the thickness of the insulation
layer [m]. The considered system boundaries (Figure 3) include all of the processes that take
place along the life cycle of the product under study (with the exception
of the use phase), supply of raw materials (petroleum-based polyol,
bio-based polyol, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate—MDI—,
kraft lignin, glycerine), manufacturing (both lignin liquefaction
and foam production), waste processing, and disposal. In accordance
with the PCR, the use phase has not been considered, as it is not
associated with energy or resource consumption nor with other flows
relevant from an environmental point of view.

Figure 3 Scheme of the main phase
of the system considered in the model.
Transport processes are omitted from this scheme.

To guarantee the validity of comparison’s results, biobased
and reference foams were produced in laboratory applying the same
procedure, in such a way as to have the same level of primary data
quality. Secondary data were chosen, where possible, to be representative
of the European area. The detailed list of the considered sources
is present in the Section 4.3.2 “life cycle inventory and modeling”.
Model has been created using SimaPro software.21

To avoid the issue of environmental burden shift
that emerged from
literature review,9−13 it was decided to investigate a comprehensive set of impact categories
(Table 5). In detail,
impact categories were selected according to the PCR’s requirements,20 whereas the impact assessment methods were chosen
following the ILCD recommendations22 (Table 5). In addition to
the categories required from PCR, marine eutrophication was also considered
because it emerged to be significant for biobased material production
as shown by Tsiroupolos et al.9

4.3 Inventory Analysis
4.3.1 Laboratory
Activities and Material Characterization
PU foams have been
obtained starting from commercial EMEROX polyols
(supplied by Emery Oleochemicals, USA) as well as lignin-based polyols,
synthesized in our laboratories. The last ones have been obtained
by liquefaction of kraft lignin from softwood (Indulin AT, MeadWestvaco
Corporation, USA) in presence of suitable solvents (glycerine and
EMEROX polyols) and acid or base catalyst (sulfuric acid 98% or sodium
hydroxide pellet, Sigma-Aldrich). Although the detailed development
and optimization of the lignin liquefaction process will be the subject
of another paper, generally speaking, the liquefaction process used
in this work is very similar to what already reported in the literature.29,30 The liquefaction solvent used was a 50/50 mixture of EMEROX 14511
and glycerine. The acid catalyst at 3 or 1% has been used to prepare
“lignin 1” and “lignin 2” polyols, respectively,
while “lignin 3” has been prepared using 1% of NaOH.
Foam obtained from fossil-based polyols has also been produced as
a reference by using polyester polyols (Isoexter 4530 and 4537, supplied
by COIM, Italy) and polyether one (Isoter 842G, COIM, Italy). The
main properties of the polyols (in particular the hydroxyl number, nOH) used to prepare foams considered in this study are
reported in Table 6. The nOH has been measured according to ISO 4629-2.

A mixture 40–40–20 parts by weight of fossil-based
polyols (respectively, Isoexter 4530, Isoexter 4537, and Isoter 842G)
has been used for preparing fossil-based foam T01.

All of the
foams have been prepared by a two-step method, that
is, polyols, catalysts, surfactant, and distilled water (used as chemical
blowing agent), have been carefully mixed. Dimethyl cyclohexylamine
(Polycat 8) and pentamethyl diethylenetriamine (Polycat 5) were chosen
as catalysts; the surfactants was TEGOSTAB B 8469; and both were kindly
supplied by Evonik (Germany).

After that, isocyanate (VORANATE
M600, Dow Chemicals) has been
added; the mixture has been mixed for 15 s by using a high-speed mechanical
mixer and then poured in an aluminium mould. The water amount has
been varied in order to obtain foams with a density within 36 ±
5 kg/m3.

Foam properties have been measured according to ISO
standards:
apparent densities according to ISO 845; and thermal conductivity
according to ISO 8301, one day after production, at a mean temperature
of 10 °C and temperature difference of 20 °C.

4.3.2 Life Cycle Inventory Analysis and Modeling
As described
in Section 4.1, the
inventory analysis consists in the collection and modeling
of all of the input and output of the processes included in the system
boundaries. To populate the life cycle inventory, data from different
sources were collected (Table 8).

Primary data on the
different formulations, liquefaction process,
and physical and mechanical characteristics of the rigid foams described
in Section 4.2 were
collected directly from the laboratory activities. The amount of foam
needed to satisfy the functional unit that was derived by applying eq 2 2  where MPU [kg]
and VPU [m3] are, respectively,
the mass and the volume of the foam, while ρ [kg/m3] is the density.

The life cycle inventory of kraft lignin
is taken from Culberston
et al.31 while data about the composition
of AA-based polyols are made available by the manufacturer. For transportation
processes, having no more specific information, a reference distance
of 100 km and EURO4 lorry (16–32 ton) have been arbitrarily
assumed. Data on the considered end of life scenario, according to
ecoinvent 3.5,32 have been modeled with
the following values: 35% incineration, 32.5% disposed in inert landfill,
and 32.5% disposed in sanitary landfill.

All other useful data
for a complete description of the processes
under study are acquired from the ecoinvent 3.532 database. In two cases,
it was necessary to modify the processes to make them more representative
of the system under study: in the ecoinvent’s original polyol
production process, the formulation has been modified according to
that provided by the manufacturer and in the foam production process,
the formulations elaborated in laboratory have replaced the original
one.

In order to guarantee homogeneity, the considered foam production
process and end of life scenario are the same for all of the formulations
and have been taken from ecoinvent 3.5.32

To simplify the management of data coming from laboratory
activities,
a parametric approach has been adopted in the modeling of environmental
impacts. Parametrization refers to the practice of presenting LCA
information using raw data and formulas instead of computed numbers
in the unit process dataset within database.33 This method also allows the creation of a data entry scheme able
to support the entire design process, without the need to directly
modify the model whenever a new formulation of foam is produced. The
model is described, using 14 independent parameters (Table 9) and 7 dependent/calculated
ones (Table 10). The
parameters have been chosen in such a way as to completely describe
the production process and, at the same time, to elaborate the data
to satisfy the demands of the PCR.20 The choice of adopting a parametric approach was also made to have better
control over the parameters that influence the environmental impacts
of insulation materials.

4.4 Impact Assessment
In order to identify
the main sources of impacts for each category along the entire life
cycle, a contribution analysis has been performed for the formulation
(materials) presented in Section 4.3.1.

The life cycle processes were
classified into six stages:1. Polyol production includes the extraction
of raw material, polyol production (both fossil and bio-based), and
transport to the foam production site;

2. Lignin production includes the production
of the lignin and the transport to the foam production site;

3. Liquefaction describes
the lignin liquefaction
in the polyol–glycerine (50/50) mixture. This stage includes
also the production and the transport of the glycerine, the acid catalyst
(1 or 3 wt %) and the energy required for the microwave oven;

4. MDI production includes
the MDI production
and transportation to the foam production site;

5. Foam production, in addition to the
process itself, it also includes transport to the site of use;

6. End of life includes all
the processes
from the deconstruction to the final disposal.



4.5 Interpretation
To discuss the results
of the impact assessment and determine the parameters to be monitored
in the development of new biobased PU formulations with improved environmental
performances, a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis were performed.

Sensitivity analysis was specifically used to investigate the validity
of results and to identify the most relevant parameters of the model,
verifying how the final results vary when the initial parameters change.
An arbitrary value of variation equal at ±20% has been considered
following a common practice in LCA studies.34 Sensitivity S has been calculated according to eq 3 3  where Δpj/p0,j is the normalized variation of the parameter j with
respect to the starting value p0,j and ΔIi/I0,i is the normalized
variation of the quantified impact for the impact category i with respect to the starting value I0,i.35 The investigated
parameters were chosen in such a way as to be the representative of
the physical properties and formulation (AAperc, lignin perc, reaction_PandL,
reaction_MDI, PU_density and PU_lambda).

The uncertainty analysis
was performed to further validate the
results of the study. Where direct uncertainty measures were not available,
the approach of the pedigree matrix36 was
adopted, and following a common practice in LCA, especially when secondary
data are used, a Monte Carlo analysis was performed.

competing financial interest.
