Cheese fondue is a popular Swiss
dish prepared by melting cheese
under the addition of wine, starch, and seasoning. The flow behavior
or rheology of fondue is crucial for mouthfeel, flavor release, and
the tendency of fondue to cling to the bread. Fondue is a complex
multiphase system whose rheology is determined by the interactions
of its colloidal ingredients. We establish cheese fondue as a water-continuous
system with dispersed fat droplets, charged caseins, and starch granules.
Irreversible phase separation, a common issue in fondue preparation,
may be prevented by addition of a critical minimum starch concentration.
Fondue was found to be a shear-thinning yield stress fluid, which
is desirable for mouthfeel and facilitates fondue to cling to the
bread for consumption. Fondue showed a viscoelastic stress response
around the gel point (G′ ≈ G″), which is proposed as crucial for the balance
of orally perceived gumminess (G′) and liquidity
(G″). Ethanol addition and lowering pH toward
the isoelectric point of casein, as associated with wine addition,
decrease fondue viscosity due to a decrease in casein micelle size.
Below the isoelectric point of casein, fondue is unstable and phase
separates, potentially impeding fondue digestion. Thus, fondue rheology
is governed by the complex colloidal interactions within its ingredients,
and ultimately determines fondue eating experience.

Introduction
Cheese fondue is a traditional Swiss dish
eaten by dipping pieces
of bread in a shared pot. It is prepared by adding wine, starch, and
seasoning to melted cheese, making fondue a multiphase system with
complex colloidal interactions and rheology.1 Fondue rheology is of particular importance for mouthfeel, flavor
perception, and letting the cheese cling to the bread for consumption.
Many half-truths persist in Swiss kitchens on how to prepare the perfect
fondue and achieve ideal structure while preventing phase separation.
In this study, we assessed the influence of fondue ingredients and
their colloidal interactions on the stability and rheology of cheese
fondue.

Most hard cheeses are produced by rennet-induced casein
coagulation.
The decreased steric and electrostatic repulsion results in the aggregation
of caseins into clusters and chains.2−4 In its solid state, cheese
can be considered a two-phase-filled gel with fat globules entrapped
in a continuous casein network.5−7 The melting behavior of cheese
depends on several superimposed factors. At room temperature, approximately
50% of the fat is in its solid state. At 40 °C, the fat is fully
liquid and acts as a plasticizer within casein micelles.8,9 The casein network shrinks with increasing temperature and water
is expelled because of increased hydrophobic interactions. This leads
to a decrease in viscosity and finally melting.10−13

While the colloidal structure
and interactions in milk and solid
cheese have been widely investigated, comparably little is known about
colloidal interactions in melted cheese. When preparing fondue, about
30–40 wt % of white wine is added, introducing water and ethanol
to the melted cheese. The final fondue is a water-continuous colloidal
system with dispersed proteins and emulsified fat droplets. Phase
separation of the solid protein, the aqueous, and the lipid phase
is a common issue in fondue preparation and is commonly prevented
by the addition of starch. It is suggested that the viscosity of fondue
depends on the colloidal interactions of these three dispersed ingredients:
starch, casein, and fat droplets. Starch is fully gelatinized at the
consumption temperature of fondue. It absorbs parts of the water and
thickens the fondue by formation of a soft particle suspension.14 The fat droplets contribute to fondue viscosity
by viscous friction.15 In cheese, casein
micelles are no longer intact and rely as aggregated clusters or chains.
Upon melting and dispersion in water, the caseins can be considered
charged suspended particles. Electrostatic interactions thus increase
in importance.16−18 The isoelectric point of casein is ≈4.7 and
may vary due to decarboxylation or deamination reactions during cheese
ripening.19 Above the isoelectric point,
casein is negatively charged, resulting in electrostatic repulsion.
Lowering pH toward the pI favors casein inter- and intramolecular
attractive interactions, resulting in a more compact structure.3,20 Because of its surface-active nature, casein will partially adsorb
at dispersed oil droplets.16

Wine
addition further introduces ethanol to the fondue. The influence
of ethanol on casein has only been investigated in milk. Low concentrations
of ethanol decrease casein micelle size and thus viscosity, while
concentrations above 10 vol % induce casein aggregation and increase
viscosity.21,22 As caseins already aggregate
during rennet-induced coagulation, the influence of ethanol in melted
cheese may differ.

The sum of all of these colloidal interactions
governs the rheology
and ultimately eating experience of cheese fondue. This study tackles
the complex multiphase system fondue from a materials science perspective.
Fondue ingredients were systematically added to a model fondue made
from cheese and water to understand their individual effect. The colloidal
interactions within the fondue constituents were assessed by its rheology
and implications on fondue eating experience are discussed.

Results
and Discussion
Rheology of Swiss Cheese Fondue: Effect of
Starch, Ethanol,
and pH
Traditional moitié-moitié model fondues
were prepared from Gruyère and Vacherin (1:1) with 40 wt %
deionized water, resulting in a total water content of 64 wt %. All
thickener and ethanol concentrations are expressed relative to this
water content. Irreversible phase separation is a common issue in
fondue preparation, commonly prevented by starch addition. Without
starch, fondue readily phase separates into a rubbery protein phase,
an aqueous phase, and creamed oil because of coalescence and density
differences, as depicted in Figure 1. At 2 wt % starch, a protein phase covered by a stable
emulsion without creaming was observed. From 3 wt % starch, no phase
separation occurred and a homogeneous fondue was obtained. The starch
granules absorb excess water and form a 3D jammed particle suspension.14 Consequently, a minimum critical starch concentration
of 3 wt % is required to prevent fondue phase separation.

Figure 1 Images of model
fondues prepared from melted Gruyère and
Vacherin (1:1) and 40 wt % water with different concentrations of
potato starch. Pictures were taken 4 h after preparation at room temperature.

The rheology of stable model fondues
was assessed by shear and
oscillatory rheology. Figure 2A,B depicts flow curve and yield stress experiments of fondues
with increasing starch concentrations. All samples showed shear-thinning
behavior and had an apparent yield stress. Thus, fondue is a shear-thinning
Herschel–Bulkley fluid.23 Viscosity
and apparent yield stress increased with higher starch concentrations.
The yield stress corresponds to the minimum stress required to induce
flow. With respect to fondue, it could predict the tendency of the
fondue to cling to the bread. Also shown in Figure 2A,B is a fondue with 3 wt % starch produced
with a model wine (water–ethanol mixture) instead of pure water,
introducing 11.2 vol % of ethanol relative to the water content. The
addition of ethanol decreased shear viscosity and apparent yield stress.
Ethanol is known to reduce casein micelle size and thereby decrease
the viscosity of dairy products.21 Literature
suggest that casein aggregates at ethanol concentrations above 10
vol %, what could increase viscosity.22 This effect is not observed in fondue as casein is already fully
aggregated during cheese production.5,24

and frequency (D) sweep experiments depicting storage modulus G′ (full) and loss modulus G″ (empty) at 1 rad/s and 0.1 Pa, respectively. Experiments were performed
at 70 °C. Lines are to guide the eye.

Oscillatory rheological amplitude and frequency sweeps (Figure 2C,D) revealed that
fondue is a viscoelastic fluid around the gel point (G′ ≈ G″ in frequency sweeps).25 Increasing starch concentration enhanced the
storage modulus G′ and resistance against
high stresses. The balance of elastic and viscous properties could
be crucial for fondue mouthfeel. Predominantly elastic properties
could make the fondue gummy, while in case of dominating viscous properties,
the fondue could be perceived too liquidy. The influence of fondue
rheology on mouthfeel is discussed in detail later.

Besides
starch and ethanol, the fondue structure may be influenced
by pH. As casein is a charged protein with isoelectric point pI =
4.7, the electrostatic interactions within caseins or within casein
and Ca2+ strongly depend on pH.20,22 The model fondues prepared with water had a pH of 5.5 and casein
thus has a negative net charge. The addition of acidic white wine
(pH 3–426) reduces the pH toward
pI and decreases casein net charge. Lowering fondue pH from 5.5 to
pI = 4.7 (from net negative to no net charge) resulted in a decrease
in shear viscosity and apparent yield stress (Figure 3A,B). At the point of no net charge, casein
no longer possesses a counterion cloud and is in its most compact
conformation. This reduces the effective hydrodynamic diameter of
casein and thus viscosity.22 This effect
was only partially reversible upon charge inversion at pH 3.6 (positive
net charge). Shear viscosity and apparent yield stress increased again
at pH 3.6 but were still lower compared to pH 5.5, even though the
positive net charge would allow a more extended casein structure.
This suggests the importance of electrostatic interactions within
casein and Ca2+. Without the ionic bridging of negatively
charged casein and Ca2+, no continuous protein network
can be formed and phase separation is induced, as shown by the image
in Figure 3A. The protein
forms a rubbery precipitate, associated with a sharp increase in G′ at pH 3.6 (Figure 3C,D). In Swiss kitchens, although unknowingly, a low
fondue pH is counteracted by the addition of sodium bicarbonate. It
is added to increase the airiness of fondue associated with released
CO2. Our results suggest that fondue creaminess might also
be enhanced due to an increase in pH.

of pH. The isoelectric point (pI = 4.7) and respective casein charge
are illustrated. Experiments were performed at 70 °C. Lines are
to guide the eye.

As indicated before,
little is known about the structure and interactions
of casein after cheese melting. We observed a decrease in viscosity
upon ethanol addition, in contrast to the increase observed in milk
due to casein aggregation.22 This indicates
that caseins remain aggregated after cheese melting. The pH-sensitivity
of fondue underlines the importance of casein electrostatic interactions
after melting. Electrostatic repulsion increases the effective diameter
of caseins and results in a more extended form of aggregated casein
clusters or chains. The minimum viscosity was observed at the isoelectric
point, where casein aggregates are in their most compact conformation.
Hence, in melted cheese or fondue, caseins are present as charged
suspended aggregates. Decarboxylation or deamination reactions may
alter the charge distribution of casein during cheese ripening.19 However, we did not observe a considerable deviation
from the pI ≈ 4.7.

Rheology is a common method for the
characterization of solid cheese
or its melting behavior.7,10 Ustunol et al.27 found a good correlation of the complex modulus G* and meltability, allowing to predict cheese melting
from rheological experiments. Small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments
were further established to assess the melting and resolidification
of Raclette cheese.28 However, the rheological
evaluation of melted cheese is often difficult due to wall slip.29,30 The use of a ball measuring system could be a promising alternative
to assess the rheology of melted cheese.

We could demonstrate
that fondue rheology is governed by the colloidal
interactions of starch, casein, and fat droplets. Being a natural
fermented product, cheese composition and final fondue rheology may
vary within different batches and cheese varieties. As the colloidal
constituents essentially remain the same, we assume that the observed
effects of starch, ethanol, and pH are applicable for fondues made
from any rennet-coagulated cheese.

Rheology of Swiss Cheese
Fondue Stabilized with Xanthan or ι-Carrageenan
Thickening
agents are commonly applied in the food industry to
stabilize or alter the structure of food. A broad range of food grade
thickeners exists, which all show specific rheological characteristics
depending on their structure.31,32 The addition of a thickening
agent to fondue is essential to prevent phase separation, as discussed
before. However, traditional starch may be replaced. Two alternative
thickening agents commonly used in foods, negatively charged ι-carrageenan
and branched xanthan gum, were investigated.

Both alternative
thickeners were able to prevent phase separation at factor ≈10
lower concentrations compared to starch (Figure 4). This derives from their different structures
and thickening mechanisms. While starch forms a granular suspension,
ι-carrageenan and xanthan have an elongated fibrous structure,
resulting in significantly lower critical overlap concentrations.31 ι-Carrageenan was the most efficient thickener
for fondue. Only minor creaming was observed at 0.25 wt % in contrast
to protein precipitation with xanthan. Negatively charged ι-carrageenan
is known to interact with Ca2+ and positively charged casein,
making it an efficient stabilizer of dairy products even at low concentrations.33

Figure 4 Images of model fondues prepared from melted Gruyère
and
Vacherin (1:1) and 40 wt % water with different concentrations of
ι-carrageenan and xanthan gum. Pictures were taken 4 h after
preparation at room temperature.

Figure 5A,B
depicts
the flow curves of fondues stabilized with xanthan and ι-carrageenan,
respectively. Compared to starch, the flow curves had a steeper slope.
The viscosity was higher at low shear rates but similar or even lower
at high shear rates. This again derives from the fibrous structure
of xanthan and ι-carrageenan. At rest, they form an interconnected
network, while at increasing shear rate, they align in the flow field.
The fibrous thickeners further resulted in a significantly higher
apparent yield stress (Figure 5C). Xanthan is known to have a high yield stress because of
its fibrous branched structure.34 In the
case of linear ι-carrageenan, the yield stress might be increased
by electrostatic interactions with casein and Ca2+.33Figure 5D depicts G′ and G″ as a function of thickener concentration. For fibrous xanthan
and ι-carrageenan, G′ was higher than G″ at all employed concentrations. For starch, lower
values were observed and G″ was still predominant
at low starch concentrations. It was argued before that the characteristic
viscoelastic response around the gel point could be crucial for fondue
oral perception. Thus, the rheological behavior of fondue can be altered
by the addition of alternative thickeners. However, too high concentrations
of fibrous thickening agents could make fondue too thick or gummy.

Implications on Fondue Eating Experience
Cheese fondue
is an excellent example of a complex food system whose eating experience
is governed by its rheology. The yield stress of fondue is crucial
as the cheese needs to properly coat the bread and resist gravity.
The thickness of the cheese layer probably increases with viscosity.
Traditionally, losing a piece of bread in the fondue is punished according
to premeal consensus of all participants, a risk that could be increased
by a high yield stress.

The rheology of food further governs
its oral perception. The shear-thinning behavior of fondue could be
desirable during oral processing and enhance flavor release. Orally
perceived thickness correlates with viscosity, whereas flavor release
correlates inversely with viscosity.35,36 On the other
hand, a high viscosity increases oral coating associated with prolonged
flavor perception.37 Fondue was found to
be a viscoelastic fluid around the gel point. We proposed that this
viscoelasticity is crucial for fondue texture perception. Upon increasing
elastic properties, for example, by addition of excess starch, a fondue
could be perceived too gummy. On the other hand, a predominantly viscous
fondue, for example, due to excess wine, could lose its yield stress
and be perceived too liquidy. Guggisberg et al.28 could previously link the rheology of Raclette cheese,
another typical Swiss dish, to its sensory perception.

The irreversible
phase separation of fondue is a common issue and
has ruined countless dinners. It may be avoided by sufficient addition
of water-binding thickeners, for example, 3 wt % starch relative to
the total water content. Traditional starch may be replaced by alternative
thickeners like ι-carrageenan or xanthan, allowing us to alter
fondue rheology depending on the structure and electrostatic interactions
of the employed thickener. We are aware that this will hardly be acknowledged
by Swiss people for future fondue preparation. However, we consider
this an alternative for the dairy industry and an interesting case
study on how different thickening agents behave in a complex multiphase
system like fondue.

The acid instability of fondue could have
implications on its digestibility.
Everyone who ever had fondue can testify that fondue digestion may
be a long-lasting process. Upon ingestion, fondue is mixed with gastric
fluids. High-viscosity meals generally impede gastric mixing and increase
perceived fullness.38 We observed phase
separation upon decreasing pH below the isoelectric point of casein
(4.7), suggesting that fondue phase separates under gastric conditions.
Gastric unstable emulsions are associated with delayed gastric fat
emptying due to fat layering in the upper stomach. This impedes fat
sensing and digestion which occurs in the duodenum, resulting in delayed
satiation.39,40 Further, fondue gelled upon acidification.
The gastric gelling of emulsions can significantly reduce the release
and digestion of fat.41,42 A delayed but tremendous feeling
of fullness is indeed often experienced after fondue consumption.
In Switzerland, there is a never-ending dispute about the correct
beverage to be consumed with fondue, as alcoholic beverages are proclaimed
to ease fondue digestion.43 Heinrich et
al.44 could show that the opposite is the
case. Alcohol induces gastric relaxation and might provide short-term
relief. However, fat emptying and digestion are delayed, promoting
long-term postprandial fullness.

Conclusions
Cheese
fondue is a popular Swiss dish made from melted cheese,
wine, and starch. There is no bigger shame in Switzerland than serving
a fondue that is too liquid, gummy, or even phase-separated, and many
myths without scientific base persist in Swiss kitchens on how to
prepare the perfect fondue. This study assessed the most relevant
colloidal interactions and their influence on stability and rheology
of model fondues.

Fondue can be considered a water-continuous
system with dispersed
fat droplets, caseins, and starch. The caseins remain aggregated after
melting and are governed by pH-dependent electrostatic interactions.
A minimum critical starch concentration of 3 wt % is required to form
a jammed soft particle suspension and prevent phase separation. About
10-fold lower concentrations may be employed in the case of more elongated,
fibrous thickeners. Negatively charged ι-carrageenan was found
to be most efficient because of electrostatic interactions with casein
and Ca2+. The elongated thickening agents resulted in increased
elastic properties, higher apparent yield stress, and more pronounced
shear thinning.

Fondue is a shear-thinning yield stress fluid
around the gel point
(G′ ≈ G″).
The shear-thinning behavior is desirable for oral processing and mouth
feel, while a yield stress is essential to make the fondue cling to
the bread for consumption. We argued that the characteristic viscoelastic
response around the gel point (G′ ≈ G″) is crucial for fondue oral perception, as fondue
may be perceived too gummy (G′ ≫ G″) or too liquidy (G′ ≪ G″). Lowering pH and the presence of ethanol both
result in a more compact casein structure and decreased viscosity.
Consequently, wine addition reduces fondue viscosity. Below the isoelectric
point of casein, fondue is unstable and phase separates, potentially
delaying fat digestion. Hence, the eating experience of cheese fondue
is governed by its complex colloidal interactions and resulting rheology.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The cheeses (Gruyère and Vacherin)
were kindly provided by Emmi Fondue AG (Langnau i. E., Switzerland).
Potato starch was obtained from Emsland Group (Emlichheim, Germany),
and HCl (37% fuming) was obtained from Merck (Buchs, Switzerland).
Xanthan gum was purchased from Jungbunzlauer (Basel, Switzerland),
and ι-carrageenan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Schaffhausen,
Switzerland).

Model Fondue Preparation
A traditional
moitié-moitié
(50% Gruyère, 50% Vacherin) fondue was prepared from 60 wt
% cheese and 40 wt % deionized water. Taking the water content of
the cheeses (from product specifications) into account, the final
water content of model fondues was 64 wt %. All thickener and ethanol
concentrations specified in the manuscript are expressed relative
to this water content. The thickening agents were suspended in deionized
water and heated to 70 °C under stirring. Grated Gruyère
and Vacherin were added under stirring until a homogeneous fondue
was obtained. Measurements were performed at 70 °C. The temperature
dependence of model fondues is provided in Figure 6. The native pH of the model fondues was
5.5 and was adjusted by addition of 1 M HCl solution.

Steady Shear Rheology
Shear rheology experiments were
performed with an Anton Paar MCR 302 (Graz, Austria) equipped with
a ball measuring system (BMS) 2 with a diameter of 12 mm.45 The fondue was transferred to the preheated
measuring cup and a transient measurement at a shear rate of 10 s–1 was performed until temperature and shear viscosity
were constant. Fondue flow curves were assessed by increasing the
shear rate from 0.1 to 100 s–1. The apparent yield
stress was determined by increasing shear stress until flow was induced.
The temperature was controlled by a water bath via the double jacketed
cup and determined with a Pt100 temperature sensor (Anton
Paar) immersed in the fondue. The cup was covered with a home-made
PVC solvent trap.

Oscillatory Rheology
Oscillatory
rheology was performed
with a dynamic stress rheometer (DSR) (Rheometric Scientific GmbH,
München, Germany) using a Couette geometry (32 mm cup diameter,
29 mm bob diameter, and 44 mm bob length). Amplitude sweeps were performed
at 1 rad/s and frequency sweeps at 0.1 Pa. The temperature was controlled
by a water bath.
