Studies on conjugated
polymers seldom report on their NMR characterization
in solution. This paper shows how NMR experiments, both 1H NMR and routine 2D NMR spectra, can help in gaining a further insight
into the aggregation behavior of conjugated polymers and could be
used to flank the more employed solid-state NMR and other spectroscopy
and microscopy techniques in the understanding of the aggregation
processes. NMR spectroscopy allows distinguishing, within the class
of poorly solvatochromic conjugated polymers, those highly prone to
form π-stacked aggregates from the ones that have a low tendency
toward π-stacking.

Introduction
Thiophene-based conjugated polymers represent
a widely studied
class of polymers with broad applications in optoelectronics.1,2 They are characterized by extended π-conjugated systems involving
the whole polymer backbone and interacting with substituents, giving
them the required optical and electronic properties. A variety of
polythiophenes, differing in side-chain length and type, has been
studied. β-Substituents make these polymers soluble and processable
in organic solvents, in contrast to the unsubstituted polythiophene
which is insoluble. One of the most employed conjugated polymers is
poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, which has been intensively
studied during the last two decades and is still actively investigated.3 The concept of conjugated polymers has extended
during time to alternated copolymers, based on a variety of aromatic
or heteroaromatic units with electron-donor or electron-acceptor characters.4

Both polythiophenes and thiophene-based
polymers can be synthesized
by a number of routes spanning from oxidative coupling with FeCl35 to every kind of catalyzed cross-coupling
reaction (e.g., Suzuki, Kumada, and Stille).6−8 A number of
books and papers on electro-optical properties and device characterization
are found in the literature,1,2,9 but only few of them report the solid-state NMR characterization
of blends1,2,10−14 or the in-depth NMR investigation of conjugated polymers in solution.15−23 Indeed, papers dealing with the synthesis and characterization of
conjugated polymers rarely report even their 1H NMR spectra,14 probably because of the discouraging broad line
widths found, which seem to prevent a deep investigation.

We
have been studying conjugated polymers for the last two decades,
and from the beginning, we devoted our interest also to the in-depth
1D and 2D NMR characterization of alkyl-(PAT) and alkylsulfanyl-(PAST) polythiophenes (Chart 1)20,21,24−29 that some of us reviewed in 2002.21 These
studies were mainly aimed at the assessment of the regiochemistry
and at the characterization of the minor configurational triads of
polythiophenes. The polymer regiochemistry can, in fact, influence
the conformation adopted by the backbone, which, in turn, is one of
the factors ruling its aggregation behavior and electronic properties.30

Chart 1 Regioregular Polythiophenes
As for the aggregation behavior in solution,
it has been commonly
investigated through ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy.
Some regioregular conjugated polymers, such as head-to-tailP3HT (and other PATs) and both head-to-tail and head-to-head/tail-to-tailPASTs, display marked solvatochromism and thermochromism.22,27,31−37 They display an unstructured UV–vis absorption band in good
solvents, which moves to a higher wavelength, assuming a vibrational
fine structure upon the addition of a poor solvent (or upon cooling)
or in the solid state (film). This behavior is attributed to the existence
of an equilibrium process between a disordered, less extensively conjugated
coil-like amorphous form, present in good solvents or at high temperatures,
and an ordered, more planar conjugated rodlike form prevailing in
marginal solvents or at low temperatures. This last form is associated
with the formation of small π-stacked aggregates. The nature
of these aggregates still stimulates the interest of the scientific
community32 because the presence of π–π
interactions among PAT chains can induce some interesting
behaviors, such as a secondary doping in conducting PATs,38 a more extended conjugation length,
which is responsible for a more extended UV–vis absorption
spectrum as well as for a higher electrical conductivity,31 and an increased charge carrier mobility,39 particularly useful when the polymer is employed
as an electron-donor material in polymeric solar cells. On the contrary,
less regioregular polymers are also less solvatochromic.31,40−42

When we moved to the study of conjugated copolymers,15−20 we observed that they were usually less solvatochromic than regioregular PATs and PASTs. This behavior can be explained
either by a high tendency to planarize and aggregate even in good
solvents or, on the contrary, by a low tendency toward aggregation,
and this can strongly influence the properties of polymer-based devices.14,43 We found that solution NMR can be very helpful in distinguishing
between these two cases, and here we report on the NMR characterization
of conjugated polymers in solution. NMR spectra obtained on polymer
solutions can show characteristic signatures indicating if a poor
solvatochromism is due to a high proneness to form π-stacked
aggregates or not.

Results and Discussion
NMR of Highly Solvatochromic
Polymers
We studied two
classes of these polymers (Chart 1): highly regioregular P3HT(28,29) and regioregular PATs functionalized at the end of
the side chains (PFATs) with hydroxy,44 methoxy,45 methylthio, hexylthio,
methylsulfinyl, phenylsulfinyl,46 piperidinyl,
and hexanoyloxy groups47 and PASTs.22,26,27

As mentioned
above, regioregular head-to-tailPATs are found in a random coil conformation in chloroform solution by
UV–vis spectroscopy. Their NMR spectra, obtained in the same
(but deuterated) solvent, display slightly broader line widths (few
hertz at half-height) with respect to those of small organic molecules,
and the common 1D and 2D NMR experiments [correlation spectroscopy
(COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), heteronuclear multiple-quantum
coherence (HMQC), heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC), and
heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC)] can be exploited for
their characterization. For instance, in the case of 85% head-to-tail regioregular P3HT, four sets of narrow aromatic proton48 and carbon chemical shifts were assigned through HMQC and
HMBC experiments to the four configurational triads and it was shown
that their chemical shifts parallel those of the central units of
the four isomeric trimers of 3-hexylthiophene.28,29 We found a very similar situation for the solutions of regioregular PASTs, both for the head-to-tail(26) and for the head-to-head/tail-to-tail ones, one of which, carrying octylsulfanyl
side chains (PSOct), is shown in Figure 1.22,27

spectrum in chloroform-d (asterisk denotes the residual
CHCl3 signal) and (b)
HSQC and (c) HMBC spectra of a head-to-head/tail-to-tail regioregular PAST with R = octyl
chain (PSOct).

These polymers are more soluble in organic solvents than PATs, and their spectral lines are only slightly broader than
those of small organic molecules. There are no problems in acquiring
heterocorrelated spectra, both one bond and long range, and also in
the obtainment of the directly acquired 1D 13C NMR spectra,
provided a sufficient concentration is employed.

NMR of Poorly
Solvatochromic Polymers
We came across
two different classes of poorly solvatochromic polymers. The first
class is formed by polythiophenes carrying alkylsulfanyl chains functionalized
with polar groups every two thiophene rings and by copolymers containing
thienothiophene and benzobithiophene units, such as those depicted
in Chart 2.

Chart 2 Examples
of Conjugated Polymers Displaying Aggregation Signatures
in Their NMR Spectra
The presence of an alkylsulfanyl chain carrying a polar
group every
other thienyl ring not only reduces the solvatochromism of these polythiophenes
but also influences the appearance of their proton NMR spectra, which
display both narrow and broad features,19,49 as can be
seen for the 1H NMR spectrum of PSCN, shown
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum of PSCN, with broad signals
marked by arrows, in chloroform-d (asterisk denotes
the residual CHCl3 signal).

Very broad components, shielded with respect to the more
narrow
ones, appear in the aromatic region. These broad signals are due to
the formation of aromatic π-stacks and derive from the mutual
shielding effect of aromatic rings placed above or below to one another
in these aggregates. Similar, even though less evident, spectral features
are detected in the aliphatic region for the portion of the alkyl
chain bound to the heterocycle, indicating that it is affected by
ring current shielding and deshielding phenomena.

More marked
effects, leading to very broad spectral components,
are observed when strongly interacting groups are present on the side
chain, as in the case of a cysteine-substituted polythiophene (PCys),20,51 the 1H NMR spectrum
of which is shown in Figure 3, and of an ammonium-substituted polythiophene50 (not shown). For these and other strongly aggregating
polymers, the obtainment of 13C NMR aromatic signals is
very time-consuming (whereas the aliphatic ones are usually detected),
low proton–carbon correlations are detected in the aromatic
region of HMQC or HSQC spectra (that probably derive from shorter
chains or terminals), and HMBC spectra contain few long-range correlations
for some of the aliphatic protons.

Figure 3 1H NMR spectrum of PCys in chloroform-d.

Nevertheless, a further insight into the structure of these
aggregates
can be obtained from proton homocorrelated spectra. Correlations through
the space between the aromatic protons and the methylene protons bound
to sulfur are found in the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy
(NOESY) spectrum (Figure 4) for both the narrow and the broad spectral components. These
are intraresidue NOE detected in a more random coil or disordered
form and in π-stack aggregates, respectively. The presence of
these two forms is supported by gel permeation chromatography that
shows a bimodal weight distribution.51 Still
in this NOESY spectrum, we find a strong NOE correlation between the
methyl ester and the t-butyl carbamate groups that
is due to an interresidue dipolar interaction due to the formation
of hydrogen bonds.51

Figure 4 (a) NOESY spectrum of PCys in chloroform-d; (b) expanded region
showing the dipolar interaction between SCH2 and aromatic
protons (further expanded in c) and that between t-butyl and methoxy signals (1.4 and 3.6 ppm, respectively);
and (d) intraresidue (solid arrow) and inter-residue (dashed arrow)
dipolar correlations.

We observed a similar tendency to form π-stack aggregates
in good solvents in other copolymers, containing thienothiophene and
benzobithiophene units.15−17 Also, these polymers display,
together with a low solvatochromism when studied with UV–vis
spectroscopy, broad components in their 1H NMR spectra.
Moreover, their aromatic carbon signals are difficult to detect, both
in directly acquired 1D 13C NMR spectra and through HSQC
experiments, as in the case of PCys. Figure 5 shows the 1H NMR
spectrum of a copolymer formed by alternating bithiophene and thienothiophene
units16 (PSBTTT in Chart 2), where broad and
narrow components coexist.

Figure 5 1H NMR spectrum of PSBTTT. The arrows evidence
some broad spectral components in chloroform-d.

A new and very intriguing feature
of this last polymer is the effect
of aggregation on the terminal part of the aliphatic chains. In fact,
NMR revealed the presence of terminal CH2–CH2–CH3 units shielded and deshielded with
respect to the principal ones.16 In particular,
two groups of methyl signals appear in the HSQC spectrum of PSBTTT (Figure 6a) at about 0.9 (usual value) and 1.1 ppm (quite unusual). Their
difference in proton chemical shifts is hardly justified by the different
substitution at the opposite side of the long alkyl chains. Indeed,
a closer inspection of the TOCSY spectrum shows that the deshielding
involves some of the alkoxy chains (dashed path, Figure 6b) and the methyl groups at
1.1 ppm belong to them. The minor signals coming from alkylsulfanyl
chains are mainly found shielded with respect to the principal ones
(right arrow in Figure 5).

Figure 6 Partial (a) HSQC (the arrows point to multiple methyl signals)
and (b) TOCSY (evidencing the correlation path that leads to the deshielded
methyl signals) spectra of PSBTTT in chloroform-d.

To explain the presence
of both shielded and deshielded signals
for the alkyl groups close to the heteroatoms and deshielded signals
for the alkyl terminals, we hypothesize that two types of aggregates
are present (Figure 7). In the type shown in 7a, the alkyl chains
are interdigitated between flanked highly ordered π-stacked
aggregates, and both the initial and the terminal portions of the
alkyl chains are forced to stay close to the deshielding zone of the
aromatic rings of an adjacent stack. In the type shown in 7b, the polymer backbones are misaligned and the
methylene groups bound to the heteroatoms are forced to stay either
above or below the adjacent polymer backbone planes of the same less
ordered π-stack and find themselves in a shielding region. In
both cases, aromatic protons should be shielded.

Figure 7 Sketches of (a) more
ordered and (b) less ordered π-stacked
arrangements in the polymer aggregates that can justify both shielding
and deshielding of the initial and terminal protons of the substituents.
In both cases, aromatic protons should be shielded.

The second class of poorly solvatochromic polymers
is formed by
regiorandom polythiophenes24,25,42,52−54 and by copolymers
containing the fluorene moiety.18,55 The 1H NMR
spectra of these polymers are characterized by quite narrow line widths
and the absence of shielded broad signals in the aromatic region.
This behavior can be explained by a low proneness of these polymers
to form π-stacked aggregates and by a tendency toward a random
coil conformation even in aggregates.

Aggregation Induced in
Solvatochromic PSOct
To understand if some aggregation
process due to π-stacking
could be evidenced for a solvatochromic polymer, regioregular PSOct(27) was investigated. When
the 1H NMR aromatic signal of PSOct is closely
observed (Figure 8a),
two components can be distinguished: one narrower and deshielded and
the other broader and shielded, appearing as a shoulder. Also, four
narrow and low shielded signals, which probably derive from terminal
chlorinated bithienyl units, are found. This is not unexpected because
it is known that chlorinated terminal units form when PATs are synthesized through oxidative coupling with FeCl3.56

Figure 8 Changes in the 1H NMR spectra
of PSOct upon
the addition of methanol: (a) chloroform solution, (b) 20% (v/v) methanol,
and (c) 30% (v/v) methanol. (d) NOESY spectrum at 30% (v/v) methanol.

Apart from a shift observed for
all resonances (also for a trace
of silicon and thus attributed to an unspecific interaction with the
added solvent), a gradual broadening of the thienyl proton signals,
a decrease of the intensity of the deshielded narrow component (Figure 8a,b), and an increase
of the shielded shoulder are detected when methanol is added to a
chloroform solution of PSOct. When the amount of methanol
induces a persistent change in color of the solution (Figure 8c), the more shielded band
becomes even broader. The integral of the global aromatic signals
(with respect to that of residual CHCl3, used as an internal
reference) also decreases, indicating the formation of some big aggregates
characterized by transverse relaxation times T2, too short to be detected by NMR. Integrals obtained by the
deconvolution of the narrow deshielded aromatic proton signal and
of the broad components (Figure 9) are consistent with the gradual disappearance of
the former and the enhancement of the latter, which were assigned
by us to the resonances from random coil free chains and π-stacked
aggregates, respectively. Signal deconvolution allows understanding
that some aggregation (shielded shoulder) is already present in the
chloroform solution at the concentration employed for NMR measurements
(3 mg/mL, much higher than that used in UV–vis studies). A
general broadening of the alkyl proton signals, more evident for those
closer to sulfur, is also observed after the methanol addition.

Figure 9 Changes of
the integrals of narrow (orange, random coil), broad
(blue, π-stacks), and total (gray) aromatic signals of PSOct due to the addition of deuterated methanol to a deuterated
chloroform solution.

An NOESY experiment allowed us to detect the dipolar (through
space)
interactions between aromatic and SCH2 shielded and deshielded
protons (Figure 8d).
Note that the shape of the enlarged cross-peak in Figure 8d closely resembles that in Figure 4, although the extent
of the broadening is lower for PSOct than those for PCys and for other strongly aggregating polymers,15−17,19 such as those reported in Chart 2. As far as the terminal
portion of the alkyl chains is concerned, no clear signs of trapping
in aggregates were found for this polymer.

Eventually, diffusion-ordered
spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments57 were
run on chloroform and on 30% (v/v) methanol–chloroform PSOct solutions (Figure 10), obtaining, quite unexpectedly, a higher self-diffusion
coefficient in the latter case (1.7 × 10–10 vs 1.3 × 10–10 m2 s–1 in chloroform). This is still more surprising if we consider that
the viscosity of methanol–chloroform mixtures increases with
respect to that of the pure solvents at high chloroform molar fractions.58 Hypothesizing a similar behavior for the deuterated
solvents, we interpolated a value of 5.7 × 10–4 kg m–1 s–1 for the viscosity
of the employed solvent mixture (taking as a reference the viscosity
of deuterated chloroform reported in ref (59)). Employing the Stokes–Einstein equation
for the translational diffusion coefficient, D = kT/(6πηrH), the
diameters of the diffusing particles can be estimated to be around
6.4 and 4.5 nm in chloroform and in methanol–chloroform mixture,
respectively. This means that the “aggregates” monitored
by NMR for PSOct probably derive from an intrachain π-stacking
process, similar to that described by Bartelt et al.,43 rather than from a real interchain aggregation. An intrachain
π-stacking process can explain the shrinking of the diameter
of the diffusing particles observed by NMR.

30% (v/v) methanol–chloroform mixture.

Conclusions
In this work, we focused on the NMR behavior
of thiophene-based
conjugated polymers and copolymers. We studied solution NMR spectra
of three categories of conjugated polymers, mainly substituted with
alkyl, functionalized alkyl, alkylsulfanyl, and functionalized alkylsulfanyl
chains.

The first category is formed by highly solvatochromic
and highly
regioregular polythiophenes. They are present in good solvents as
free chains, in a random coil conformation, and give 1D and 2D NMR
spectra in chloroform as if they were small organic molecules, at
least up to a number average molecular weight of 20 kDa, which was
the highest we studied. These polymers planarize and aggregate in
the presence of poor solvents and in films, as demonstrated by studies
mainly based on UV–vis spectroscopy.

The second category
is formed by polymers that display low solvatochromism
and present, in the aromatic region of 1H NMR spectra,
broad shielded components that are due to the shielding induced by
the π-stack formation on the aromatic protons. The proneness
to form π-stacked aggregates, even in good solvents, is at the
base of the low solvatochromism of these polymers. Despite the large
line widths, common 2D NMR experiments (HSQC, TOCSY, and NOESY) can
still be used to gain a further insight into the structure of the
aggregates.

Polymers that display low solvatochromism but do
not present signs
of aggregation in their NMR spectra form the third category. They
are regiorandom polythiophenes and copolymers containing the fluorene
units. For these polymers, the poor solvatochromism observed can be
explained with a low tendency to form π-stacks in solution.

When aggregation is induced by the addition of a poor solvent to
a solvatochromic polymer, PSOct, in chloroform solution,
the signs of the formation of π-stacked structures can be detected.
In fact, some spectral broadening of the aromatic resonances and the
disappearance of the deshielded narrow component are observed. Furthermore,
NMR shows that the terminal portions of the side chains seem not to
be trapped in PSOct aggregates, at least the NMR-visible
ones. Eventually, DOSY experiments indicate that the hydrodynamic
radius of the NMR-visible aggregates is 30% lower than that of the
random coil polymer chains. This finding suggests the formation of
intrachain π-stacked regions rather than to a real interchain
aggregation process, at least for the NMR-visible aggregates of PSOct.

In conclusion, in this paper, we showed that
NMR spectra can be
a valuable diagnostic tool for monitoring the proneness of conjugated
polymers to form π-stacks. Details on these aggregates can be
derived using 2D NMR experiments, which can be employed even when
broad lines are present in 1H NMR spectra. These experiments
can be used in conjunction with other more employed techniques (UV–vis
spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, solid-state NMR, atomic
force microscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy)
to study the aggregation modes of conjugated polymers.

1H and 13C
NMR spectra were recorded with
Bruker Avance 400 and Avance III HD 600 spectrometers, operated at
400.13 and 600.13 for proton and at 100.61 and 150.90 MHz for carbon,
respectively, using standard pulse sequences on 3–10 mg/mL
solutions. Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra (mlevetgp) were acquired
using 1 s relaxation delay, 60–100 ms mixing (spin-lock) time,
10–20 ppm spectral width, 2–4k data points, 8–32
scans per increment, and 256 increments. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra
(noesygpph) were acquired using 1 s relaxation delay, 50–100
ms mixing time, 10–20 ppm spectral width, 2–4k data
points, 24 scans per increment, and 256 increments. Two-dimensional
echo–antiecho phase-sensitive HSQC edited spectra (hsqcedetgpsp)
were acquired using 0.5 s relaxation delay, 1.6 ms evolution time,
10 ppm spectral width in f2, 2k data points, 16–96 scans per
increment, 160 ppm spectral width in f1, and 160–400 increments.
Two-dimensional HMBC spectra (hmbcgplpndqf) were acquired using 0.5
s relaxation delay, a 2.9 ms low-pass J filter, 50–100 ms evolution
time, 10 ppm spectral width in f2, 4k data points, 32–160 scans
per increment, 160–180 ppm spectral width in f1, and 160–400
increments. DOSY experiments were performed at 298 K, on 5 mm NMR
tubes spinning at 20 Hz, using a stimulated echo sequence incorporating
bipolar gradient pulses and a longitudinal eddy current delay (ledbpgp2s),
250 ms diffusion time (big delta), 5 ms longitudinal eddy current
delay (Te), 2 × 1 – 1.5 ms
δ (little delta), and 64 linear gradient ramp, with a maximum
strength of 58 G cm–1, followed by a gradient pulse
recovery time of 200 μs. After Fourier transformation and baseline
correction, the diffusion dimension of the 2D DOSY spectra was processed
by means of the Bruker TopSpin 3.5 software package. Deconvolution
of 1H NMR spectra was done with Mnova 9.1.0 software (2012
Mestrelab Research S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain).
