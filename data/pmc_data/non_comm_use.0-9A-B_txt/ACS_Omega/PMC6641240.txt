In this study, we report the utilization
of low-temperature solution-processed
Cs-doped VOX thin films as the hole extraction layers (HELs)
in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It is found that the VOX:yCs (where y is the mole ratio
of Cs versus V and y = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) thin films
possess better electrical conductivities than that of the pristine
VOX thin film. As a result, the PSCs incorporated with
the VOX:yCs HEL exhibit large fill factors
and high short-circuit currents, with consequently high power conversion
efficiencies, which is more than 30% enhancement as compared with
pristine VOX HEL. Our studies provide a facial way to enhance
the electrical conductivity of the hole extraction layer for boosting
device performance of perovskite solar cells.

1 Introduction
Perovskite
solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention in
both academic and industrial sectors due to the superior optoelectronic
properties of hybrid perovskite materials and cost-effective manufacturing
processes of PSCs.1−4 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been boosted from
3.8 to 22.1% in the past 8 years.5−9 In PSCs, a typical device structure was inherited from dye-sensitized
solar cells, where the mesoscopic TiO2 layer was used as
the electron extraction layer (EEL) and the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide
lithium salt (LiTFSI)-doped 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) was used as the hole extraction layer (HEL), respectively.10,11 However, high-temperature (500 °C) sintering was required to
deposit the mesoscopic TiO2 EEL. Moreover, the deteriorative
stability of the LiTFSI-doped spiro-OMeTAD HEL significantly impeded
the manufacturing applications of PSCs.12,13 To circumvent
these problems, a planar heterojunction (PHJ) device was developed,
where the perovskite active layer was sandwiched between the anode
and cathode electrodes.14−17 Typically, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) HEL and the phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl
ester (PC61BM) EEL are used in the PHJ PSCs for boosting
device performance.18,19 However, the acidity and hydrophilicity
of the PEDOT:PSS layer have been demonstrated to degrade the device
performance.20

Rather than the PEDOT:PSS
HEL, wide band gap transparent metal
oxides, such as NiO,21,22 CuOX,23,24 MoO3,25 and VOX26 have also been utilized as the HEL
in the PHJ PSCs. Among them, VOX has been extensively studied
because it possesses good thermal and chemical stability and it can
be prepared with low cost as well.27−29 Snaith et al. first
applied solution-processed VOX thin films as the HEL in
the PHJ PSCs, but the PHJ PSCs with the VOX HEL exhibited
low device performance due to the poor coverage of CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the VOX HEL.26 Recently, we reported low-temperature solution-processed
VOX HEL for the PHJ PSCs, however an interfacial layer
is required to modify the VOX HEL for approaching high
PCEs.30

In this study, we report
solution-processed Cs-doped VOX thin film as the HEL for
the PHJ PSCs. A combination of characterizations
indicate that the VOX:yCs (where y is the mole ratio of Cs versus V, and y = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) thin films possess better electrical conductivities
than that of the pristine VOX thin film. As a result, the
PHJ PSCs incorporated with the VOX:yCs
HEL exhibit large fill factors (FFs), high short-circuit currents,
and consequently high PCEs compared to that with pristine VOX HEL.

2 Results and Discussion
X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was first carried out to
study the composition of the pristine VOX thin film and
VOX:yCs thin films. All XPS spectra were
calibrated by the C 1s core level located at 284.6 eV. Figure 1a presents V 3d and O 1s peaks
from pristine VOX and the VOX:yCs thin films. The binding energy observed from these thin films
are in good agreement with those reported values.31,32 As shown in Figure 1b, peaks located at 737 and 722 eV from the VOX:yCs thin films are observed. These peaks are assigned to
Cs 3d3/2 and Cs 3d5/2, correspondingly. Moreover,
the intensity of these peaks are gradually enhanced with the increase
of the Cs-doped mole ratio in the VOX:yCs thin films. These results indicate the Cs element is indeed doped
in the VOX:yCs thin films. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)
displays the binding energy of 400 eV corresponding to N 1s peak.
The VOX film displays a relatively high N 1s peak, indicating
residual N of ammonium metavanadate existed in the VOX thin
film. The presence of a decreased amount of nitrogen along with the
increased Cs-doped molar ratio in Figure S1 virtually suggests that ammonium metavanadate was completely transformed
into the VOX thin film after the Cs-doping. The O 1s peak
located at 531 eV shows a shift (Figure 1a) as the Cs-doped molar ratio is increased,
which confirms that ammonium metavanadate was completely transformed
into the VOX thin film after the Cs-doping.

Figure 1 XPS spectrum of (a) V
3d and O 1s and (b) Cs 3d of pristine VOX thin film and
the VOX:yCs thin
films.

Figure 2a depicts
the transmittance spectra of pristine VOX thin film and
the VOX:yCs thin films. It is found that
the VOX:yCs thin films possess slightly
varied transmittances ranging from 75 to 91% from wavelengths of 375–520
nm, as the doping concentrations of Cs are changed. In addition, both
VOX and VOX:yCs thin films
present over 80% transmittance at wavelengths ranging from 450 to
800 nm. Such high transmittance enables to ensure sun light to be
absorbed by CH3NH3PbI3 layer.33 The optical band gap is estimated from the plot
as the intercept of the linear fit at the onset of thin-film absorption
with χ-axis.34Figure 2b presents the (βE)1/2 versus hν of pristine VOX thin film and the VOX:yCs thin
films, where β is the optical absorption coefficient, which
is calculated using the relation βd = ln(1/T), where T is the transmittance and d is the film thickness, and E is the photon
energy. Thus, both pristine VOX and the VOX:yCs thin films exhibit a similar optical band gap of 3.5
eV, indicating that Cs-doping has a negligible influence on the optical
band gaps of the VOX:yCs thin films.

tin oxide (ITO)/ VOX:yCs/Ag in dark.

The electrical conductivities
of pristine VOX and the
VOX:yCs thin films were further investigated
by evaluation of the current versus voltage (I–V) characteristics of a diode with a device architecture
of ITO/VOX (or VOX:yCs)/Ag,
where ITO is indium tin oxide and Ag is silver. The results are shown
in Figure 2c. The electrical
conductivity (σ) is described as I = σSd–1V, where d is the film thickness and S is the device
area.35 The electrical conductivities of
pristine VOX thin film, the VOX:0.1Cs thin film,
the VOX:0.3Cs thin film, and the VOX:0.5Cs thin
film are estimated to be 7.93 × 10–4, 8.78
× 10–4, 1.05 × 10–3,
and 1.08 × 10–3 S m–1, respectively.
As the Cs-doped mole ratios increase from 0 to 0.3, the electrical
conductivities of thin films show a simultaneous increase, whereas,
as the Cs-doped mole ratio is further increased to 0.5, the electrical
conductivity doesn’t rise higher.

Figure 3 and Table 1 show the surface
film morphologies of pristine VOX thin film and the VOX:yCs thin films. The root mean square (RMS),
which is used to describe the surface roughness of 0.32 nm, is obtained
from pristine VOX thin film, whereas the enlarged RMS roughness
of 1.27 and 1.51 nm are observed from the VOX:0.1Cs and
VOX:0.3Cs thin films, respectively. The enlarged RMS roughness
of VOX:0.3Cs thin film indicates that the interfacial adhesion
between the VOX:0.3Cs thin film and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer would be enhanced. The improved interfacial
adhesion is helpful to provide an additional charge pathway from the
CH3NH3PbI3 layer to the HELs.36,37 In Figure 3d,f, an
inhomogeneous phase separation pattern and the small island microstructural
film morphology are observed from the VOX:0.1Cs and VOX:0.3Cs thin films. Such film morphologies are consistent with
the nanodomain structure in the VOX thin films reported
by others.31 In addition, as the Cs-doped
mole ratio is further increased to 0.5, the RMS roughness draws back
to 0.84 nm. The smooth film morphology from the VOX:0.5Cs
thin film might be attributed to the Cs enrichment with high Cs-doped
concentration.

The PSCs with a device structure of ITO/HELs/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/bathocuproine
(BCP)/Ag,
where either pristine VOX thin film or the VOX:yCs thin films are used as the HELs, are fabricated
for evaluating the functionality of the VOX:yCs HELs. Figure 4a
presents the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs incorporated with pristine
VOX HEL and the VOX:yCs HELs
(where PSCs are represented as PSCs VOX and PSCs VOX:yCs, respectively). Table 2 summarizes the device performance parameters
of the PSCs with different HELs. The PSCs VOX exhibits
a VOC of 0.95 V, a short-circuit current
(JSC) of 16.83 mA cm–2, a fill factor (FF) of 70.17%, and a PCE of 11.15%, whereas the
PSCs VOX:0.1Cs exhibits a VOC of 0.93 V, a JSC of 20.14 mA cm–2, a FF of 74.91%, and a PCE of 13.91%. The PSCs VOX:0.3Cs exhibits a VOC of 0.92
V, a JSC of 20.67 mA cm–2, a FF of 76.46%, and a PCE of 14.48%. The PSCs VOX:0.5Cs
shows a VOC of 0.92 V, a JSC of 19.69 mA cm–2, a FF of 65.10%,
and a reduced PCE of 11.77%. Approximately 30% PCE enhancement is
achieved from the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs in contrast to that of
the PSCs VOX. The improved PCEs from the PSCs VOX:0.1Cs and PSCs VOX:0.3Cs are mainly originated from the
significantly enhanced JSC and FF, implying
the charge collection efficiencies are improved by the highly electrical
conductive VOX:0.1Cs and VOX:0.3Cs HELs. A reduced
PCE from the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs is mainly attributed to the
decreased FF, which is probably due to the reduced interfacial adhesion
between the VOX:0.5Cs layer and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, giving rise to the low charge collection
efficiency in PSCs.

of the PSCs incorporated with pristine VOX and the VOX:yCs HELs; (b) external quantum efficiency
(EQE) spectrum of the PSCs incorporated with pristine VOX and the VOX:yCs HELs.

Table S1 in SI summarizes the photovoltaic
parameters of the PSCs with VOX:0.3Cs HELs processed from
different metavanadate concentrations. It is found that the best device
performance is observed from the PSCs with VOX:0.3Cs HEL,
where the VOX:0.3Cs HEL is processed from metavanadate
with a concentration of 13.3 mg mL–1.

To investigate
the reduced VOC in PSCs
with VOX:yCs HELs, Figure S2a,b in the SI presents the ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) of pristine VOX thin film and the VOX:0.3Cs thin film. The secondary electron cutoff and the Fermi
level (EF) are used to determine the ionization
potentials (IPs).38 The IPs are estimated
to be −4.9 and −4.7 eV for pristine VOX thin
film and the VOX:0.3Cs thin film, respectively. A good
match of the IP values with the highest occupied molecular orbital
energy level (−5.4 eV) of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer would result in a large VOC in PSCs.39,40 Thus, the reduced VOC in the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs is attributed to the
increased IPs of the VOX:0.3Cs thin film compared to that
of the pristine VOX thin film.

Figure 4b presents
the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs. The PSCs VOX:yCs displays an enhanced EQE response from
420 to 790 nm as compared to that of the PSCs VOX. The JSC values from integration of the EQE spectra
are 17.29, 19.80, 20.00, and 19.38 mA cm–2 for the
PSCs VOX, PSCs VOX:0.1Cs, PSCs VOX:0.3Cs, and PSCs VOX:0.5Cs, respectively. These JSC values are in good agreement with those obtained
from the J–V characteristics.

To further understand the underlying physics of enhanced JSC and FF of the PSCs incorporated in the VOX:yCs HELs, the series resistance (RS) and the shunt resistance (RSH) are estimated from J–V characteristics and the results are summarized in Table 2. The RS value from the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs is 3.25 Ω
cm2, which is smaller than that for the PSCs VOX:0.1Cs (3.37 Ω cm2) and PSCs VOX (5.07
Ω cm2). The smaller RS can reduce the contact resistance and/or bulk resistance, resulting
in high photocurrent flow through PSCs, and consequently high JSC.41 Because the
PSCs VOX:0.5Cs has a dramatically large RS value of 6.58 Ω cm2, a reduced FF is
obtained from the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs. For solar cells, it is
of great importance to keep the RSH as
large as possible because the large RSH value can avoid the current loss and leakage current.42 The RSH value from
the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs is 3275.86 Ω cm2, which
is the largest one compared to that for the PSCs VOX:0.1Cs
(2510.16 Ω cm2), PSCs VOX (1583.33 Ω
cm2), and PSCs VOX:0.5Cs (635.61 Ω cm2). The enlarged RSH values for
the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs are beneficial for suppressing the leakage
current, resulting in a larger FF and JSC. The enlarged RSH values are in good
agreement with enhanced FF from the devices with corresponding HELs.

To understand charge carrier recombination kinetics of the PSCs
incorporated with the VOX:yCs HELs, the
light-intensity dependence on JSC and VOC is further investigated and the results are
shown in Figure 5a.
According to the power-law fit, the JSC can be correlated with the light intensity by JSC ∼ Iα, where I is the light intensity. The extent of the deviation of
α from 1 is closely related with nongerminate recombination
loss in PSCs. A larger deviation implies more pronounced nongerminate
recombination.42 As shown in Figure 5a, under the circuit-current
condition, the PSCs VOX displays a large deviation of α
= 0.91 from 1, implying more pronounced nongerminate recombination,
whereas the PSCs VOX:0.1Cs and PSCs VOX:0.3Cs
show smaller deviations of α = 0.94 and α = 0.96 from
1, respectively. The decreased deviations indicate a minimized nongerminate
recombination, which is well consistent with the observed increase
in the RSH and high hole collection efficiency.
Moreover, as the Cs-doped mole ratio is increased, the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs shows an enlarged deviation of α = 0.93 from
1, implying an enhanced nongerminate recombination in PSCs VOX:0.5Cs. At the open-circuit condition, the relation between
light intensity and VOC can be described
as VOC ∼ S ln(I), where I is the light intensity and S is the slope.35Figure 5b depicts the VOC dependence of I for the PSCs incorporated
with different HELs. The VOC of the PSCs
VOX is dependent on the I, with a slope, S, of 2.08 kT/q (ca. 0.052),
where T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and k is the Boltzmann
constant. The PSCs VOX:0.1Cs and PSCs VOX:0.3Cs
exhibit an ideal slope of 1.04 kT/q (ca. 0.026) and kT/q (ca. 0.025),
respectively. The ideal slope of the PSCs VOX:0.1Cs and
PSCs VOX:0.3Cs indicates trap-assisted charge recombination
can almost be suppressed in the PSCs VOX:0.1Cs and PSCs
VOX:0.3Cs.35,42 Meanwhile, the slope S of 1.36 kT/q (ca. 0.034)
is observed from the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs, suggesting more serious
trap-assisted charge recombination in contrast to those of the PSCs
VOX:0.1Cs and PSCs VOX:0.3Cs. The results are
consistent with the photovoltaic performances of the devices with
the VOX:yCs HELs.

Figure 5 (a) JSC dependence upon different light
intensities for the PSCs with different HELs; (b) VOC dependence upon different light intensities for the
PSCs with different HELs.

To understand the effect of different HELs on the charge-extraction
process in PSCs, transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement was conducted
to monitor the transient charge-extraction lifetime. The TPC measurement
can provide direct information on charge extraction, transport, and
trapping in PSCs.43,44Figure 6 presents the normalized TPC of the PSCs
with different HELs. The smaller charge-extraction lifetime of 0.22
μs is observed from the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs as compared
to that of the PSCs VOX (0.39 μs) and PSCs VOX:0.1Cs (0.30 μs). The smaller charge-extraction lifetime
indicates the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs exhibits reduced trap-assisted
charge recombination and higher charge-extraction efficiency.45 In addition, the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs possesses
a dramatically larger charge-extraction lifetime of 0.65 μs,
indicating less charge carriers to be extracted by VOX:0.5Cs
HEL. These results are in good agreement with the results from the
light-intensity dependence on JSC and VOC curves.

Figure 6 Transient photocurrent measurement for
PSCs with different HELs.

Figure 7 shows
the
hysteresis behaviors of the PSCs with pristine VOX and
VOX:yCs HELs. In our study, under the
forward scan, the PCE of the PSCs VOX is 12.32%; when the
PSCs VOX is under the reversed scan, the PCE is 13.07%.
These results indicate a 6.1% deviation under different scan directions.
The PSCs VOX:0.1Cs shows a PCE of 13.93% at the forward
scan direction and a PCE of 14.52% at the reversed scan direction.
These results indicate a 4.2% deviation under different scan directions.
For the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs, the PCE of 14.42% is observed under
the forward direction and a PCE of 14.03% under the reversed direction,
indicating a 2.7% deviation under different scan directions. The degree
of photocurrent hysteresis in the PSCs VOX:0.3Cs is dramatically
reduced in contrast to that of the PSCs VOX and the PSCs
VOX:0.1Cs. The decreased photocurrent hysteresis is probably
originated from the highly electrically conductive VOX:0.3Cs
HEL and the highly efficient charge extraction process, where suppressed
charge recombination takes place,35 whereas,
the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs exhibits a PCE of 11.58% at the forward
scan direction. Under the reversed scan, the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs
exhibits a PCE of 12.34%. A 6.6% deviation is observed from the PSCs
VOX:0.5Cs under different scan directions. The enlarged
hysteresis in the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs might be due to the deteriorative
charge collection efficiency in the PSCs VOX:0.5Cs.

Figure 7 J–V characteristics of
PSCs with different HELs measured at forward scan (from −0.2
to 1.0 V) and reversed scan (from 0.2 to −1.0 V).

As we all know, the stability of the PSCs in ambient
conditions
is one of the most difficult problems before the PSCs move toward
the market. We have examined the storage stability of the devices
incorporated with pristine VOX and VOX:yCs HELs. The measured devices were stored in the dry box
with the relative humidity varying in the range from 10 to 20% and
the ambient temperature varying in the range from 25 to 30 °C
even without encapsulation. The devices were measured periodically,
with the relative humidity varying in the range from 50 to 70%. Figure S3 in SI displays the PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF changes of
the devices with stored time. The PCEs of the PSCs retained 83.28,
94.04, 92.54, and 48.16% of their initial PCEs after 30 days when
incorporated with VOX, VOX:0.1Cs, VOX:0.3Cs, and VOX:0.5Cs HELs, respectively. The moderated
reduction of PCE is associated with slow decline of the JSC, VOC, and FF. Although
the devices were stored in the atmosphere conditions without the high
humidity, the moderated reduction also confirms that both the devices
incorporated with VOX:0.1Cs and VOX:0.3Cs HELs
display excellent stability in ambient conditions.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated the VOX:yCs thin films by adding cesium hydroxide monohydrate
into metavanadate
precursor solution. The VOX:yCs thin films
exhibit high electrical conductivity in contrast to that of the VOX thin film. According to the AFM results, the addition of
Cs element in the VOX thin films can change their phase
separation pattern and microstructural film morphology. Moreover,
the VOX:0.3Cs thin film exhibits enlarged surface roughness,
resulting in enhanced interfacial adhesion between the HEL layer and
the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The light-intensity
dependence on JSC and VOC and TPC results indicate that the VOX:0.3Cs
HELs can effectively suppress the charge recombination process and
enhance the hole extraction efficiency in PSCs. As a results, the
PSCs VOX:0.3Cs exhibits better device performance than
that of the PSCs VOX, PSCs VOX:0.1Cs, and PSCs
VOX:0.5Cs. All of these results demonstrate that our findings
provide a protocol for preparing HEL toward high-performance PSCs.

The composite
of 53.2 mg of metavanadate powder
mixed with cesium hydroxide monohydrate with different molar ratios
(where y is the mole ratio of Cs versus V, y = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5) were dissolved into 4 mL of deionized
water followed with being magnetically stirred at 60 °C till
the solution was completely changed to a transparent solution. Afterward,
the solution was filtered by poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filters (2
μm). VOX:yCs thin films were spun-cast
on the top of precleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates from
above solutions, followed with thermal annealing at 210 °C for
8 min in the ambient atmosphere.

4.3 Characterization
of VOX:yCs Thin Films
Transmittance
spectra of the VOX:yCs thin films were
measured on a HP 8453
spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed on
Bruker multimode 8. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted
on an Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer, with Al Kα excitation radiation.

10 min in the glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere and then cooled down
to room temperature. The CH3NH3I thin film was
then deposited on top of the PbI2 thin film from CH3NH3I ethanol solution, with a concentration of
35 mg mL–1, followed by placing the prepared thin
film in the petri dish. Afterward, the prepared thin film was thermally
annealed at 100 °C for 2 h to convert PbI2 and CH3NH3I into CH3NH3PbI3 thin film. It should be noted during the thermal annealing process,
∼7 μL of DMF solvent was added at the center of the petri
dish for tuning the film morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.46 A PC61BM thin layer (∼60 nm) was then deposited on top of
the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film from chlorobenzene
solution (20 mg mL–1) at 1000 rpm for 36 s. Thereafter,
∼5 nm BCP was then spin-casted on top of the PC61BM layer from ethanol solution (0.5 mg mL–1) at
4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an ∼100 nm silver electrode was
deposited on the top of the BCP layer by thermal evaporation in vacuum
at a base pressure of 2 × 10–6 mbar. The device
area was measured to be 0.057 cm2.

4.5 Characterizations
of PSCs
The current
density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source
meter under AM 1.5G illumination from a solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI,
XES-40S1), with a light intensity of 100 mW cm–2. The light intensity was calibrated by using a certified reference
silicon cell (PV measurement, with a KG5 filter). The external quantum
efficiency (EQE) spectrum of PSCs was conducted on a DSR100UV-B spectrometer
with a bromine tungsten light source and an SR830 lock-in amplifier.
The light intensity was calibrated with a Si detector. Transient photocurrent
(TPC) measurement: the solar cells was serially connected to a digital
oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C) and the input impedance of the
oscilloscope set to 1 MΩ and 50 Ω, respectively, for monitoring
the charge extraction time. When pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire
oscillator-seeded regenerative amplifier with a pulse energy of 1.3
mJ at 800 nm (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace), the pulsed laser provided
120 fs wide λ ≈ 500 nm pulses, with a repetition rate
of 1 kHz. The 500 nm laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric
amplifier with TOPAS-Prime. The TPC was measured by applying 500 nm
laser pulses with a low pulse energy to the short-circuited devices
in the dark.
