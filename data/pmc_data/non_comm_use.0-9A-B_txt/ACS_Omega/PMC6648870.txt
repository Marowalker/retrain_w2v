One-dimensional
nanomaterials, including both nanowires (NWs) and
nanotubes (NTs), have been extensively investigated in the decades
because of their unique physicochemical properties. Particularly,
aligning NWs/NTs into a network or complex micropatterns has been
a key issue for its unique integrated functionalities, which enjoy
benefits in versatile applications. So far, solution processes remain
the most effective strategy to align NWs/NTs, which also bear advantages
of mild operation condition and large-scale production. In this perspective,
particular attention is drawn to the currently widely used solution
coating approaches for aligning NWs/NTs, including the Langmuir–Blodgett
film technique, solution shearing approaches, and methods of tri-phase
contact line manipulation. We also proposed several perspectives in
this field.

1 Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials
including nanowires (NWs) and
nanotubes (NTs) bear unique electronic, optical, and magnetic properties1−3 for its high aspect ratio and mechanical flexibility, which have
been exploited in various applications of optoelectronics,4−9 biological sciences,10−13 energy harvesting,14−17 and chemical sensing,18−22 and thus serve as an attractive research topic in the decades. Particularly,
aligned NWs/NTs have shown various integrated properties in both mechanical
and electrical regard,23,24 which has been currently widely
used in developing flexible electronic devices, such as flexible electrodes,25−28 stretchable electronics,29−31 and e-skin.32,33 In the fabrication of the electronic devices, the precise location
and orientation of NWs/NTs are essential and crucial to achieve their
advantages of integrated physicochemical properties for the adequate
device performance. Therefore, trying to realize highly aligned NWs/NTs
in various micropatterns remains a main challenge in building blocks
for high-performance micro/nanodevices.

In nature, highly aligned
1D materials have been observed in a
centuries-old technique for transporting timber by the river.34 Inspired by this, diverse solution processes
such as drop casting,35,36 spray coating,37−40 Langmuir–Blodgett (LB)
film,41−44 solution shearing,45−48 external electric/magnetic field,49,50 three-phase
contact (TCL) line manipulating,51−54 etc. have been developed to align
NWs/NTs into functional patterns. So far, solution processes remain
the most effective strategy for aligning NWs/NTs, which also bear
advantages of mild operation condition and large-scale production.
In this perspective, here, we reviewed solution processes aiming to
align NWs/NTs that were widely used in recent years, which were summarized
into three categories based on different driving forces (Figure 1): (i) LB technique,
where NWs/NTs are aligned as a consequence of anisotropic contraction
of the solution film under the external forces from barriers; (ii)
solution shearing methods, where directional shearing forces of solution
on other medium were used, including the blown bubble approach, blade
coating method, spray coating route, and fluid flow-directed technique;
(iii) approaches by manipulating the TCL. Each approach has advantages
and limitations. Here, both the fundamental principles and the applications
were discussed in detail for each category. Finally, future perspectives
of aligning NWs/NTs are proposed, which may shed light on the controllable
alignment of 1D nanomaterials using solution processes.

of approaches currently widely used for
aligning NWs/NTs.

2 LB Technique
As a general method to align 1D nanomaterials under compression
by external force, the LB technique originated from an ancient lumbering
operation in North America in the 19th century, in which aligned timbers
covered the river surface, forming a spectacular sight (Figure 2a).34 Then, a similar “logs-on-a-river” approach on a nanoscopic
level was reported to direct NW assembling, which was called the LB
compression technique.44,55 As shown in Figure 2b, in the LB trough, a dispersion
of NWs in an organic solvent spreads on the water surface, generating
a randomly distributed and loosely packed NW monolayer at the air–water
interface. NWs are then compressed slowly by computer-controlled barriers
with the surface pressure monitored. The surface pressure is a cognitive
factor that affects the assembly process and the final morphology
of the NW film in the LB technique, which can be adjusted by mechanically
moving one or two barriers on the liquid surface.56

To better understand the alignment process, thermodynamic
analysis
and large-scale molecular dynamics theoretical evaluation were taken
to reveal the NW assembly mechanism (Figure 2b).57 By comparing
the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurement, several
stages of the alignment process can be identified. During the initial
stage, a low surface pressure was shown, where NWs are packed loosely
in the liquid surface with a far distance between each other. As the
two barriers get closer, randomly dispersed NWs tend to bundle and
align with each other, and meanwhile, the free energy becomes lower
because the free space for NWs becomes limited gradually. The surface
pressure at this stage is dominated by the conformation entropy due
to the still far distance for the short-range interactions such as
van der Waals forces until the formation of a well-defined freestanding
NW monolayer structure, where the attractive potential from the increased
weak molecular interactions dominates. Moreover, large-scale molecular
dynamics theoretical evaluation was also introduced to numerically
simulate the alignment process. The compression generates densely
aligned NWs that are parallel to the trough barriers. The resulting
NW film can be transferred from the air–liquid interface onto
desired solid substrates by either horizontal or vertical lift-off.
By transferring multiple times, an NW network with controllable layers
and mesh size can be obtained.27

This versatile and general method has attracted explosive attention
worldwide for the major advantage of the ability to align various
NWs over large areas with ultrahigh packing density (Figure 2d–g),42,58−60 which can be utilized to fabricate integrated functional
micro/nanodevices.61−63 For example, Ag and W18O49 NWs
have been manipulated to fabricate an NW network for the flexible
transparent electrochromic devices (Figure 2h).41 Flexible
and transparent electrodes were large-scale-fabricated by co-assembling
Ag NWs with Te NWs using the LB technique and then etching away Te
NWs, leaving Ag NWs with controllable pitch (Figure 2i).27 Moreover,
aligned Ag NW monolayers have been used as excellent substrates for
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with large electromagnetic field
enhancement factors (Figure 2j).44 Although the technique has
been proven to be versatile for aligning various NWs/NTs, there are
still some limitations inherent in this assembly method. For example,
(i) the reorganization of NWs/NTs during transfer from the air–liquid
interface onto desired solid substrates leads to overlapping features
and gaps within the dense arrays.64,65 (ii) The aligning
process is usually conducted at the air–water interface, which
may be inapplicable for some materials and devices that are easily
damaged by water.66 (iii) For hydrophilic
nanosized building blocks, the surface of the nanomaterials must be
functionalized with hydrophobic ligands for the LB experiment, which
greatly restricts their future application.63,67,68

3 Solution Shearing-Induced
Alignment
Except for the LB technique, solution shearing
is widely used to
align NWs/NTs with the parallel direction to that of the shearing
force. The shearing force is an unaligned force, which tends to push
two parts of the body into opposite directions. The shearing force
is often generated by the motion of a fluid or solid against another
one. Different types of motion means have been developed, such as
the spreading/dewetting of a solution on the surfaces, the mechanical
movement of two plates/rolls in opposite directions, and the relative
motion of a solution and the surfaces. Under solution shearing force
from these motions, NWs/NTs have been aligned for functional patterns
and high-performance micro/nanodevices.65 The main viable methods that are currently used in recent years
have been reported as the blown bubble, blade coating, spray coating
route, and fluid flow-directed techniques.

Blown bubble technique
is a simple and efficient alignment method,
which consists of (i) preparation of a homogeneous and stable NW/NT
suspension, (ii) expansion of the suspension to form a bubble with
controlled pressure and expansion rate, (iii) transfer of the bubble
film to desired substrates (Figure 3a,b).69 Using this technique,
a uniformly aligned NW/NT film on rigid or flexible curved surfaces
can be obtained with controllable density and large-area scales (Figure 3c), which can be
further used for a field-effect transistor (FET) (Figure 3d). This method offers significant
advantages compared to other methods. However, it is limited by both
the lack of tight control over the distribution of NWs/NTs and the
possible contamination from the polymer coating, which impedes this
method for mass production applications.70

coating process and the resulting Si NW alignment (Copyright 2012

Blade coating is a powerful and widely used method
for NW/NT alignment,
in which the NW/NT solution is sandwiched between a shear blade and
a substrate. As the shear blade moves, the meniscus of the solution
separates and dries, depositing aligned NWs/NTs on the substrate with
the direction of NWs/NTs parallel to that of movement. For better
alignment of NWs/NTs, special treatment was performed for the substrates,
for instance, alternating patterns of solvent wetting and dewetting
regions (Figure 3e)47 or optimizing the substrate temperature (Figure 3g).71 Thus, densely aligned SWCNTs are deposited on the patterned
substrate and further used for FET (Figure 3f). Orthogonal aligned Ag NW networks by
two-step blade coating are applied in constructing quantum dot light-emitting
diodes (QLEDs) (Figure 3i). The limitation of this method lies in the pretreatment of the
substrates complicating the fabrication process.

Another attractive
approach for large-scale and highly aligned
NWs/NTs was the spray coating route (Figure 3j).37 In this
alignment process, the NW/NT suspension was pressurized to spray through
a nozzle onto a temperature-controlled substrate, including silicon,
glass, and flexible substrates. The fast flow of the NW/NT suspension
causes solution shearing, resulting in the alignment of NWs/NTs. The
alignment with controlled orientation and density can be obtained
over a large scale under controlled conditions of the nozzle flow
rate, droplet size of the sprayed NW suspension, spray angle, and
the temperature of the receiver substrate. This route is promising
for mass production, but the aggregation of the nanomaterials in the
alignment process is non-negligible.

Microfluidic flow is usually
used to align NWs/NTs by combining
surface patterning techniques. Micrometer-sized channels are used
to confine the fluid flow. When homogeneous suspensions pass through
the microfluidic channels, NWs/NTs are deposited on the substrates
and aligned along the flow direction driven by solution shearing.45,72,73 The alignment degree of NWs/NTs
can be controlled by the flow rate, which is because higher flow rates
produce larger solution shearing, resulting in better alignment. Moreover,
the distribution density of NWs/NTs can be regulated by the flow time
and the concentration of NWs/NTs in the solution.65 Through multiple repeating of the fluid-directed alignment
process, complex geometry patterns such as layer-by-layer crossed
NW/NT network have been obtained.74 The
challenge for the alignment obtained by this microfluidic flow technique
is to precisely control the position of the deposited NWs/NTs.

4 Alignment by Manipulating TCL
Furthermore, the manipulation
of solid–liquid–gas
TCL of NW/NT solution on the substrates has been developed as another
efficient method to align various NWs/NTs, which benefits from surface
tension and capillary flow. In an evaporation-induced alignment process,
NWs/NTs are aligned around the TCL due to solvent evaporation.75 The simplest demonstration of the alignment
assisted by TCL shift is through the use of an evaporating liquid
droplet, where NWs/NTs deposited onto a substrate reorient perpendicular
to the direction of the TCL to minimize fluid drag.51,76 During evaporation, the liquid moves to the edge of the droplet
to compensate the solvent loss caused by evaporation, which is called
Marangoni flow.77 Thus, a liquid flow toward
the solvent–substrate–air TCL is generated, which transports
NWs/NTs to the evaporation front and aligns them along the direction
of the flow, that is, perpendicular to the direction of the TCL (Figure 4a). When the solvent
completely evaporates, NWs/NTs are ideally expected to align along
the radial direction of a circle (Figure 4b).53 In a word,
solid–liquid–air TCL is crucial for the assembly because
pinning of the contact line is the prerequisite to induce the outward
capillary flow.78−80 Various approaches have been developed to achieve
TCL manipulation for NW/NT alignment.

Through the observation of contact line deposition
and alignment
of NWs in an evaporating droplet (Figure 4d,e), Yang et al. programmed the stick–slip
motion of the solvent contact line during dip coating to align NWs
over large areas (Figure 4c). By this programmed dip coating, selective positioning
of NW arrays with controllable density and spacing can be achieved
(Figure 4f,g).51 Recently, Ko et al. fabricated highly conductive
and transparent electrodes using a capillary printing technique (Figure 4k), in which highly
aligned Ag NW arrays were produced by the anisotropic dragging of
Ag NW solutions via a pretreated PDMS stamp (Figure 4j,h). The key technologies of this strategy
are the physical confinement to prealign Ag NWs in the PDMS nanochannels
and the subsequent alignment of NW by controlling the TCL, which exerts
capillary forces on the meniscus-trapped Ag NWs due to solvent evaporation
(Figure 4i).81 In addition, very recently, our group has achieved
aligning Ag NWs by facile bioinspired directional liquid transfer
to control the TCL (Figure 4l,o).82 The conical fiber array
(CFA) was used to guide Ag NW solution directional transfer under
cooperative effect of the Laplace pressure difference, asymmetrical
retention force, and gravity (Figure 4m). The receding TCL of the Ag NW solution can be finely
controlled by CFA-guided directional liquid transfer during the dewetting
process (Figure 4n),
which enables Ag NW alignment at the edge of TCL.

5 Conclusions and Outlook
In conclusion, we reviewed the recent
progresses on aligning NWs/NTs
by solution processes, including the LB film technique, solution shearing
approaches, and methods of TCL manipulation. These strategies enjoy
advantages of mild experimental conditions and large-scale production.
Aligned NWs/NTs, which are normally prepared by solution processes,
have shown versatile perspective applications in many fields: (1)
Aligned NWs/NTs are helpful in making a high-performance FET, which
is the building block and active element of integrated circuits for
signal amplification and readout. For example, it has been reported
that the aligned CNTs may exhibit higher mobility and on-current density
due to its lower tube-to-tube junction resistance compared with that
of random-network CNTs.47 Moreover, aligned
metallic NWs/NTs can be considered as the gate, source, and drain
electrodes for the flexible FET.30 (2)
Aligned NWs/NTs serve as important building blocks in making flexible
electronic devices when conductive NWs/NTs were used, such as artificial
skins, wearable devices, and stretchable displays. Compared to conventional
rigid wafer-based electronic conductors, the conductive NW/NT film
can remain continuous and maintain high conductivity under iterative
deformation by bending, stretching, and stressing. Particularly, the
aligned NWs/NTs show anisotropic conductivity, which endows the directional
recognition of flexible electronic devices. Under iterative forces
from two directions, spaces between the aligned NWs/NTs are periodically
changed in head-to-head or side-by-side direction, resulting in the
continuous and relative changes of the resistance of the aligned NW/NT
film. This may cast a new light on the directional force sensing of
the artificial skins and wearable devices. (3) Aligned NWs/NTs can
be used in making electrochromic devices. For example, aligned WO3–y NWs can be used in making smart
windows by a reversible electrochemical process. Compared with disordered
NW/NT networks, aligning NWs/NTs can achieve precise deposition of
NWs/NTs. Meanwhile, by adjusting the density of NWs/NTs, the balance
of the optical transmittance and the conductivity of the aligned NW/NT
film can be simply implemented. Therefore, in the preparation process,
the uniformity in large area and the suitable density of NWs/NTs are
always desirable. In addition, aligned NWs/NTs can serve as conductive
micropatterns by which localized electrodeposition can be realized.82 Despite various advantages of solution processes
in aligning NWs/NTs, solution processes still suffer from limitations,
including the reorganization of NWs/NTs during transfer, nonuniformity
over a large area, and difficulty in micropatterns without templates.
Here, we proposed several perspectives in aligning NWs/NTs: (1) trying
to accurately control the alignment and orientation of NWs/NTs at
microscale; (2) trying to realize the large-area uniformity for the
NW/NT alignment; (3) trying to achieve the NW/NT alignment with various
densities; (4) aligning NWs/NTs without an external field, special
operation skills, and complex deposition parameters. Taken together,
the solution process techniques remain the most efficient approaches
to align NWs/NTs for the future applications in diverse electronic
devices.
