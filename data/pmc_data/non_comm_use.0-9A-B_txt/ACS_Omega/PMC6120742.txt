Platinum nanocrystals with a fine
control of the crystal domain
size in the range 1.0–2.2 nm are produced by tuning the NaOH
concentration during the UV-induced reduction of H2PtCl6 in surfactant-free alkaline ethylene glycol. The colloidal
solutions obtained are characterized by transmission electron microscopy
and pair distribution function analysis, allowing analysis of both
atomic and nanoscale structures. The obtained nanoparticles exhibit
a face-centered cubic crystal structure even for the smallest nanoparticles,
and the cubic unit cell parameter is significantly reduced with decreasing
crystallite size. It is further demonstrated how the “UV-approach”
can be used to achieve spatial control of the nucleation and growth
of the platinum nanocrystals, which is not possible by thermal reduction.

Introduction
To optimize catalysts
for chemical production or energy applications,
developing nanomaterials has proven to be a rewarding strategy. In
particular, costly precious metal catalysts benefit from being scaled
down to few nanometers since nanomaterials show high surface-to-volume
ratios and only surface atoms are involved in catalytic processes.
At the nanoscale, size and structure control are key:1 nanoparticle catalyst properties like catalytic activity,
selectivity, and/or stability2 are strongly
affected by their size and structure.3 Since
most of the catalytic properties relate to the specific atomic arrangements
between precious metal atoms,4,5 the structure of the
nanoparticles should ideally be controlled and well defined even at
the smallest nanoparticle size.

Assessing the crystal structure
of materials of few or sub-nanometers
can be challenging by standard techniques such as X-ray diffraction
or high-resolution electron transmission microscopy (HRTEM).6 Pair distribution function analysis (PDF) of
X-ray total scattering data is here used along with transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) to characterize the structure, size, and size distribution
of Pt nanoparticles obtained by a recently introduced UV-induced synthesis
in alkaline ethylene glycol (EG).7 It is
first confirmed that increasing the NaOH/Pt molar ratio leads to smaller
nanoparticles3 in the UV-induced synthesis.
PDF analysis shows that the size distribution increases with crystallite
size, and it is established that even the smallest nanoparticles take
the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, where the unit cell
parameter decreases with decreasing crystallite size. Furthermore,
it is demonstrated that UV-induced synthesis offers unique options
for the localized synthesis of nanoparticles: a feature that could
be relevant to the further development of nano-based devices where
localized formation of nanoparticles is key.

Results and Discussion
The ethylene glycol (EG) process is a popular green synthesis method
to produce nanoparticles;8,9 in particular, precious
metal nanoparticles like platinum (Pt) can be obtained without using
a surfactant.10 The particle formation
can be induced in different ways: at ambient temperature conditions,11 using thermal synthesis,10 using microwaves,12 or using
UV light, as we recently showed.7 Due to
its simplicity, the UV method is a promising alternative to standard
thermal synthesis routes as only a UV-transparent container and a
UV source are needed. Here, size control in the UV synthesis of Pt
nanoparticles is achieved by tuning the concentration of NaOH.7 In the present study, the NaOH/Pt molar ratio
is changed from 125 to 0. TEM analysis in Figure 1 reveals that the particle size is then controlled
in the range 1.9 (±0.5) to 3.4 (±0.6) nm.

and (d–f) size distribution

NaOH/Pt molar ratios of: (a, d) 125, (b, e) 25, and (c, f) 0.

One of the large obstacles in
the characterization of the atomic
structure of nanoparticles is that conventional diffraction methods,
that is, powder X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement analysis,
are challenged when going to the nanoscale: the lack of long-range
order makes crystallographic methods insufficient. Bragg peaks broaden
as the particles get smaller, and new structures different from those
known from bulk chemistry may also become stable when going to the
extreme nanoscale.13−15 However, by using the X-ray total scattering signal
(including both Bragg peaks and diffuse scattering) and pair distribution
function (PDF) analysis, it is possible to characterize the structure
of materials without long-range order.6,16 Over the last
decade, this technique has been demonstrated for the structural characterization
of a large range of different nanoparticles,17−19 including ultrasmall
metallic nanoparticles14,15 and platinum-based catalyst materials,20−25 and has helped in understanding how new structural motifs become
stable when going to nanosized materials. Compared to HRTEM, where
structural information is obtained at the expense of time-consuming
and often challenging imaging of several individual single nanoparticles,
PDF analysis provides the average structure of a sample of nanomaterials.

Here, PDF is performed to investigate the effect of a change in
the initial NaOH/Pt molar ratio on the nanoparticle size and structure.
The X-ray total scattering data obtained for suspensions of Pt nanoparticles
in EG prepared with different NaOH/Pt ratios are shown in Figure 2a. The large majority
of the signal arises from the EG solvent, as can be seen when comparing
the measurement from the pure EG with the nanoparticle-containing
samples. Clear Bragg peaks are seen from the particles obtained with
the lowest NaOH/Pt molar ratios, while broader, weaker features are
seen in the scattering pattern for the particles prepared with NaOH/Pt
= 25 and 125.

Figure 2 (a) Normalized intensity of X-ray total scattering data
obtained
for (b) PDF analysis of Pt nanoparticles prepared with different NaOH/Pt
molar ratios of: (blue) 0, (red) 25, and (black) 125. An offset was
added to the curves for display purposes.

The PDFs obtained from the data are shown in Figure 2b. The data clearly show that
the ordered
domain size increases with decreasing NaOH/Pt molar ratio as PDF peaks
extend to higher r-values as the NaOH/Pt molar ratio
is decreased. For the Pt nanoparticles studied here, control of the
crystallite size in the range 2.2–1.0 nm is achieved by changing
the NaOH/Pt molar ratio from 0 to 125.

To extract quantitative
information, the PDFs were modeled using
Diffpy-CMI.26 The PDFs were modeled applying
the fcc structure (space group Fd3̅m) and a spherical dampening function with a log–normal
size distribution, as recently introduced in the characterization
of zeolite-supported nanoparticles with PDF.27 The fits obtained are shown in Figure 3 with the results summarized in Table 1. Fits using a single
spherical dampening function, as usually applied in PDF modeling (Figure S1 and Table S1), underestimate the crystallite size and give large misfits to the
PDF at higher r-values. This illustrates that modeling
of the size distribution is particularly important in studies of very
small nanoparticles (under 3 nm), where PDF is very sensitive to size.

distribution.

The obtained size distributions are reported in Figure 4 and confirm that
higher NaOH/Pt
molar ratios lead to smaller nanoparticles. Overall, the refined size
distributions are in agreement with the overall size determined by
TEM, although the size determined from PDF is slightly smaller than
what is observed from the TEM characterization for the nanoparticles
in this study.

The fcc model agrees well with the data for all particle
sizes.
Since the pioneering work by Wang et al.10 on the surfactant-free synthesis of Pt nanoparticles in EG, it is
considered that 1–2 nm Pt nanoparticles have the fcc crystal
structure as bulk Pt. X-ray scattering studies28 and HRTEM29 have further supported
this observation. Here, it is successfully shown using PDF that even
for the smallest nanoparticles obtained by the surfactant-free EG
synthesis, the Pt nanoparticles crystallize in fcc structure and that
size control of the nanocrystal domain can be achieved by controlling
the NaOH/Pt molar ratio during synthesis. This result is in contrast
to other metallic nanoparticles, for example, Ni and Pd, and Au, where
nanosizing can dramatically change the atomic structure, and for example,
icosahedral or decahedral motifs are seen.14,15,30−33 Even though the fcc structure
describes the main peaks for all samples, the fit quality decreases
with decreasing crystallite size. This is often observed for nanoparticles
where, for example, surface disorder is likely to be seen. In fcc
nanoparticles, a similar misfit has previously been observed and assigned
to structure rearrangements on the surface.14 The origin of the misfit may also be the presence of some degree
of twining between crystalline domains in the nanoparticles. However,
introducing known structures such as decahedra, icosahedra, or cube
octahedra did not improve the fit quality.

The refined structural
parameters are plotted as a function of
mean size in Figure 4 and tabulated in Table 1. The unit cell parameter decreases with decreasing size,
as also previously observed in Pt nanoparticles, where lattice contraction
is known and believed to be related to surface effects.24,25,34 We also see a clear effect of
size on the Biso values, which describes
atomic motion in the Pt nanoparticles, but may also account for structural
disorder. An increase in the Biso parameter
with decreasing particle size has previously been explained to arise
from bond softening and disorder in carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles.25 The delta2 parameter describes the correlated
motion between neighboring atoms in the fcc structure, and again we
see a clear trend, as the refined value decreases with decreasing
size. The degree of correlated motion increases in the ordered, large
particles.

When considering the PDFs at small r-values as
shown in Figure S2, an additional small
peak is present at 2.4 Å. This agrees well with a Pt–Cl
distance, as previously observed in solutions of H2PtCl6·3H2O.23 This indicates
that a small amount of chloride is present in the sample, either present
as [PtCl4]2– complexes or as Cl– coordinated to the surface of the Pt nanoparticles.

The UV-induced
synthesis is a convenient synthesis method, which
allows for well-controlled nucleation and growth of the nanoparticles,
leading to narrow size distribution. As just demonstrated, size control
is achieved for the nanocrystals by tuning the NaOH/Pt molar ratio.
An additional and unique feature of UV synthesis is that it should
also allow localized synthesis. Upon UV irradiation, the nanoparticles
form only in the part of the solution exposed to UV irradiation. A
proof-of-concept of such localized synthesis is presented in Figure 5a. It is demonstrated
that Pt nanoparticles indeed only form in the section of the cuvette
not covered with aluminum foil. This demonstrates the potential for
in situ localized formation of nanoparticles.

Figure 5 (a, b) Schematic representation
and pictures of localized synthesis
of Pt nanoparticles obtained using UV-induced synthesis. Large-scale
pictures of the cuvettes are provided in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Information.

It is further established that the localized synthesis can
be performed
using a UV laser; see Figure 5b. Only on the area exposed to the UV light laser beam (spot
of ca. 2 mm diameter at the cuvette interface as shown in the zoomed
image), a brown color can be observed, which indicates the localized
formation of Pt nanoparticles. With the nonfocused laser irradiation,
the nanoparticle formation was limited to the interface. This could
be due to the fact that the nanoparticles, once formed, can absorb
the UV light and act as a filter. This leads to attenuation of the
laser light, preventing the formation of nanoparticles further away
from the surface. This phenomenon is often called the inner filter
effect.35 However, focusing or two-photon
excitation should allow for depth control over the nanoparticle formation.36

Conclusions
In conclusion, it is
shown by PDF characterization that the nanoparticles
produced using UV light have an fcc crystal structure and that the
size of the crystallite domains increases from 1.0 to 2.2 nm when
the NaOH/Pt molar ratio decreases from 125 to 0. It is also demonstrated
that UV-induced synthesis is promising to develop an in situ localized
synthesis of Pt nanoparticles, for example, by focusing a UV beam
on the reaction mixture. Structural information is essential to tailor
the nanoparticles for specific needs, for example, in chemical synthesis
or energy-related reactions. Further understanding of the nanoparticles
formation could be gained by performing in situ PDF analysis during
the nanoparticle synthesis. A deeper knowledge on the formation mechanism
of the nanoparticles using for instance surfactants or different solvent
mixtures could allow further control on the nanoparticle properties.

Methods
UV-Induced
Polyol Synthesis
The Pt nanoparticles were
obtained using 2 mM H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.9% Alfa Aesar) in alkaline NaOH (98.9%, Fisher Chemical) ethylene
glycol (spectrophotometric grade, Alfa Aesar) with a NaOH/Pt molar
ratio as indicated and for a volume of typically 3 mL. For UV-induced
synthesis, the reaction mixture was placed in standard (10 mm path
length) quartz cuvettes (capacity of 3.5 mL, 4.5 cm high) and placed
in a home-built container equipped with 10 standard UV mercury lamps
(PL-L 24 W/10/4P Hg, Philips) for 2 h. For localized synthesis of
Pt nanoparticles, the UV-induced synthesis procedure with a NaOH/Pt
molar ratio of ∼25 was used, but part of the cuvette was covered
with aluminum foil. The irradiation time was 3 h. In contrast to a
previous publication,7 no temperature control
was present during UV-induced synthesis of the Pt nanoparticles in
this publication. Alternatively, a UV laser (375 nm, ∼0.9 mW,
LDH-P-C-375, PicoQuant GmbH) was used with an exposure time of 2 h.

Nanoparticle Washing
Pt nanoparticles were collected
and washed with 1 M aqueous solutions of HCl (prepared from 30% HCl
Suprapur, EMD Millipore, Merck KGaA in ultrapure water, Milli-Q, Millipore,
18.2 MΩ·cm) in a volume ratio of around 1:3. The dark precipitate
was centrifuged at 2400 relative centrifugal force (4000 rpm, Sigma
2–5 laboratory centrifuge, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. This washing
step was repeated twice to remove any remaining EG or NaOH.

TEM Characterization
For TEM analysis, a Jeol 2100
microscope operated at 200 kV was used. For TEM, the Pt nanoparticles
were washed and redispersed in pure ethanol (99.9%, Kemetyl) and diluted
50 times as previously described.7 Small
drops of colloids then were placed on carbon-coated copper grids (300
mesh grids, Quantifoil) and dried in room conditions. The size and
size distribution analyzes were performed by measuring the size of
typically 200 (at least 165) nanoparticles with ImageJ software, and
samples were characterized by taking images of (at least) three different
magnifications in (at least) five different areas of the TEM grids.
The log–normal distribution parameters were obtained using
the fit function of OriginPro software on the relevant data set.

X-ray Total Scattering Data Collection and PDF Analysis
X-ray total scattering data were collected at beamline P02.1, PETRAIII,
DESY. The data were collected with an X-ray wavelength of 0.2072 Å,
using the PerkinElmer detector (200 by 200 μm pixel size) at
a detector distance of 20.059 cm. The samples were loaded in 1 mm
Kapton tubes. Prior to the measurements, the nanoparticles were washed
in HCl as described above and redispersed in EG to obtain a concentration
of Pt ca. 140 mM for the measurements. EG was used as background.
Data were collected for each sample for 12 min. The data were integrated
using Fit2D,37 Fourier transformed in xPDFsuite,38,39 and modeled using Diffpy-CMI.26
