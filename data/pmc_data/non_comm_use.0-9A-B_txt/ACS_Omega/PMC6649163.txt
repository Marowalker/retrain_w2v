Three new multicomponent
crystals 1a–1c of
Zn(II), Mn(II), and Co(II), respectively, were synthesized by the
reaction of 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine, the respective metal salts,
and sodium benzoate in a 1:1:2 ratio. One component of these multicomponent
crystals 1a–1c is the dicationic 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine
metal complex and the other component is the dianionic tetrabenzoate
complex of the same metal. The complexes were fully characterized
by single-crystal X-ray structure determination. The X-ray structure
of these compounds 1a–1c reveals the formation
of 1D supramolecular chain parallel to the crystallographic b axis via H-bonding interactions between the dicationic
and dianionic parts of the respective compound. The Mn(II) (1b) and Co(II) (1c) complexes show antiferromagnetic
coupling between the two associated metal centers via the H-bonding
interaction pathway. All the three compounds 1a–1c were tested as heterogeneous catalytic systems for the successful
conversion of epoxides to cyclic carbonates in solvent-free condition
under approximately 10 bar of pressure of CO2 and temperature
ranging between 60 and 80 °C along with tetrabutyl ammonium bromide
acting as a cocatalyst. All the three compounds 1a–1c were found to have turnover number more than 1000 for the respective
epoxides except for the conversion of cyclohexene oxide to cyclohexene
carbonate.

Introduction
The
increasing level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to
the burning of fossil fuels and other environmental emission sources
has caused alarming impacts on earth’s climate. Hence, the
conversion of carbon dioxide into valuable chemical feedstock has
become an imperative. Several processes are known including the conversion
of CO2 into methanol,1−6 urea,7 polycarbonates,8−10 and cyclic
carbonates.11−32 Several catalytic systems have been designed for the synthesis of
cyclic carbonates involving metal–organic framework materials
and discrete metal complexes11−32 under both homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction conditions.16,18 From the mechanistic point of synthesis of cyclic carbonates by
different catalytic systems, it is clear that the catalyst should
provide a Lewis acidic site for the initial binding of the epoxide
molecules.33−35 Looking at the scope of catalysts for the conversion
of CO2 into cyclic carbonates, we planned to design supramolecular
heterogeneous catalytic systems which can provide green methods for
this conversion process. Supramolecular chemistry and self-assemblies
have attracted much attention in recent years.36−43 Development of new topologies and utilization of the supramolecular
aggregates as functional materials have evolved as major aspects in
this research area. It may be noted that noncovalent interactions,
namely, strong and weak hydrogen bonds, C–H···π
interactions, π/π stacking, halogen–halogen, sulfur–sulfur,
gold–gold, and so forth, are being increasingly utilized to
generate self-assembled structures.36−43 It is also well known that some crystals may contain more than one
chemical species, and these multicomponent crystals are known as cocrystals.44−51 In comparison to the large number of organic cocrystals, there are
only a few multicomponent crystals containing only metal complexes
as the components.52−60 2,6-Bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine (dhmp) has been extensively investigated
as a ligand in coordination compounds.61−64 A few mononuclear complexes of
2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine are reported where the hydrogen atoms
corresponding to the hydroxyl groups of the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine
molecule get hydrogen bonded to the respective counteranions to form
supramolecular aggregation in the resulting crystal lattice61,62 which shows interesting magnetic properties in the case of cobalt
complex.63 In this report, we have synthesized
three new set of multicomponent crystals 1a–c,
(Scheme 1), where the
mononuclear 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine complex cations [Co(II)(L)2]2+, [Mn(II)(L)2]2+, and [Zn(II)(L)2]2+ cocrystallize with the respective benzoate complex anions
[Co(II)(PhCOO)4]2–, [Mn(II)(PhCOO)4]2–, and [Zn(II)(PhCOO)4]2– (Scheme 1). The cocrystallization results in the formation of supramolecular 1D chains via the H-bonding interaction between the H-atoms
of the respective hydroxymethyl groups of the [M(II)(L)2]2+ cation and the benzoate carboxylate group
of the respective [M(II)(PhCOO)4]2– anion.
These supramolecular multicomponent crystals showed the antiferromagnetic
exchange interaction in the case of 1b and 1c through the intermolecular H-bonding interaction pathway. All of
the three complexes are found to catalyze the conversion of epoxide
and CO2 to cyclic carbonates under solvent-free heterogeneous
conditions. Many heterogeneous catalytic systems are known but to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of multicomponent
crystals acting as heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses and Characterization
The
complexes 1a–1c (Table 1) were synthesized by refluxing the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine
(L), sodium benzoate, and metal salts (1:1:2) in a methanol–water
mixture (Scheme 1).
The single crystals suitable for diffraction quality were grown by
slow evaporation of the respective solutions over one week.

Description
of the Structure of [ZnIIL2][ZnII(PhCOO)4] (1a), [MnIIL2][MnII(PhCOO)4] (1b), and [CoIIL2][CoII(PhCOO)4] (1c)
The structures of 1a, 1b, and 1c are shown in Figure 1. In all of the cases, the
dipositive metallic 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine cation [MIIL2] cocrystallizes with dianionic metal tetrabenzoate
[MII(PhCOO)4]. In the structure of 1a, the coordination environment of dicationic Zn(II) is occupied by
four alkoxy oxygen atoms and two pyridyl nitrogen donor atoms. The
coordination environment of Zn(II) is pseudo octahedral with the N1–Zn1–O2
and N1–Zn1–O1 angles as 102.32° and 77.4°,
respectively. The distance between Zn1–N1 is 2.021 Å,
whereas the distances between Zn1–O1 and Zn1–O2 are
2.165 and 2.167 Å, respectively. The coordination environment
of the dianionic zinc(II) is occupied by four benzoate anions. The
average distance between the carboxylate oxygen and the Zn(II) in
zinc carboxylate complexes is between 1.99 and 2.37 Å.65 In the case of 1a, four Zn–O
distances lie in the range of 2.09–2.10 Å, whereas the
other four Zn–O distances lie in the range of 2.536–2.549
Å which is above the average bond distance between the Zn–O
in carboxylate complexes. The bond angles around the Zn(II) are 126.90°,
117.10°, 87.27°, and 126.90°. The important bond distance
and bond angles are provided in Table S1 of Supporting Information file. The dicationic Zn(II) is bonded to the dianionic
Zn(II) by the supramolecular H-bonding interactions between the hydroxyl
hydrogen atoms H2A and H1A of the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine and
the benzoate carboxylate atoms O3 and O4, respectively.

Figure 1 Coordination
environments of metal ions and ligands in the complexes 1a, 1b, and 1c.

Because of this H-bonding interaction, the crystal packing
of 1a shows the formation of 1D supramolecular
chain
parallel to the crystallographic b axis, as shown
in Figure 2. The details
of the H-bonding interaction are provided in Table 2. In the case of 1b, the
coordination environment around the dicationic [MnIIL2] is also pseudo octahedral with the angles between
N1–Mn1–O2 ranging from 73.31° to 107.18° and
the angles between N1–Mn1–O1 ranging from 73.27°
to 106.26° (Table S1). The coordination
environment of dianionic [MnII(PhCOO)4] is occupied
by four benzoate anions. The Mn–O distances vary between 2.270
and 2.397 Å. The bond angles between O–Mn–O vary
from 55.50° to 91.92°. The dicationic [MnIIL2] forms H-bonding interaction with the dianionic
[MnII(PhCOO)4] with the formation of H-bonding
between H2A–O3 and H1A–O6 producing a 1D chain (Figure S1) parallel to crystallographic b axis (H-bond parameters given in Table 2). In the case of cobalt compound 1c, the dicationic [CoIIL2] is also
pseudo octahedral with the N1–Co1–O1 ranging from 77.13°
to 102.78° and N1–Co1–O2 ranging from 77.42°
to 102.68°. The dianionic [CoII(PhCOO)4] environment is tetrahedral and occupied by four benzoate anions
with all of the four Co–O distances being equal to 2.146 Å
and the O–Co–O angles varying from 84.87° to 127.16°
(Table S1). The dicationic [CoIIL2] interacts with the dianionic [CoII(PhCOO)4] with the formation of H-bonding between
H2A–O3 and H1A–O5. The H-bonding interaction (Figure S2) produces a 1D chain parallel
to crystallographic b axis (H-bond parameters given
in Table 2).

Magnetic
Studies
Magnetic Study of 1c
Magnetic susceptibility
measurements were carried out on crushed single crystals of 1c with an applied magnetic field of 1000 G in the temperature
range 1.5–300 K using a quantum designed SQUID magnetometer.
The magnetic properties of 1c, in the form of χM versus T and χMT versus T per two Co(II) ions, are presented
in Figure 3. The χMT value per two Co(II) centers at 300 K is
5.60 cm3 mol–1 K which is much higher
than those expected for an isolated spin-only value of 2.24 cm3 mol–1 K for two uncoupled Co(II) ions,
one high spin Co(II) tetrahedral center with S =
3/2 spin, and one low spin Co(II) octahedral with S = 1/2. The higher value cannot be explained in terms of orbital
contribution which is very common for Co(II) octahedral high spin
system, but in our case, Co(II) octahedral state is in low spin state
because of the presence of strong field ligand and will not exhibit
orbital contribution and also other Co(II) center is high spin tetrahedral
which also ruled out the possibility of the presence of orbital contribution.
Therefore, the higher value of χMT of Co(II) centers may arise from two possibilities. First, the octahedral
Co(II) low spin center may undergo John Teller distortion which can
induce some orbital contribution due to further splitting of d-orbitals
and second possibility may be due to the presence of crossover region
with some spin state equilibrium which is very common for the d7 octahedral system. It may happen that at low
temperature, low spin is the ground state but with increase in temperature,
high spin state forms because of shifting of spin state equilibrium
which in turn can induce some amount of orbital contribution into
the system and thus can lead to higher χMT value than the theoretical one. First, it exhibits a monotonic
decrease in χMT until it reaches
a minimum of 4.91 cm3 mol–1 K at 18 K
with decreasing temperature which indicates the presence of dominant
antiferromagnetic interactions taking place between two Co(II) paramagnetic
centers. Then, a sudden increase in the χMT (5.38 cm3 mol–1 K) value
upon further lowering the temperature was observed at 16 K and finally
a rapid decrease to a value of 4.39 cm3 mol–1 K at 1.5 K, indicating an intermolecular antiferromagnetic interaction
or a system of spin canting followed by the effect of saturation phenomena.
The dominant antiferromagnetic coupling is mainly occurring by H-bonding
interaction between two Co(II) centers, one octahedral center linked
to a strong pyridyl ligand and one tetrahedral Co(II) center coordinated
to a weak benzoate ligand. Though there is no direct superexchange
pathway between the metal centers as they reside in a cocrystal, but
still χMT versus T of complex 1c reveals magnetic interaction which can
only be supported by H-bonding interaction between the metal centers.
This result can be justified by fitting χM versus T plot with a Co(II) dimer model (Figure 3) with one correction term used to roughly
account the orbital contribution and interdimer interaction that gives
the value of the coupling constant J = −6.08
cm–1 using the Hamiltonian H =
−2JS1S2 where S1 and S2 are spin states of two metal centers. The value of the coupling
constant obtained for 1c by theoretical calculation was
found to be −84 cm–1. Moreover, χM–1 versus T data obey Curie–Weiss
law with the best-fitting parameters C = 5.65 cm3 mol–1 K and θ = −2.77 K (Figure 3). The negative θ
value also indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction
at high temperature. However, abrupt rise in χMT value below 18 K suggests a ferromagnetic transition operating
in complex 1c; the observed ferromagnetic-like ordering
may be attributed to canted antiferromagnetism where perfect antiparallel
alignment of the spins on neighboring metal ions between the antiferromagnetic
coupling layer is not achieved, leading to the generation of residual
spins.

Figure 3 Plot of χM vs T and χMT vs T (inset) (left) where
red line indicates theoretical fitting and plot of χM–1 vs T data fitting using Curie–Weiss
equation in the range 1.5–300 K (right) for compound 1c.

However, complex 1c does not show any hysteresis loop
around 2 K. The origin of spin canting is either (i) magnetic anisotropy
or (ii) antisymmetric exchange where the spins are slightly tilted
from their original position. As it was observed that at higher temperature,
antiferromagnetic coupling was operating between two Co(II) centers
through H-bonding which is very uncommon occurring in any system of
a cocrystal and as an evidence, we are also getting negative coupling
constant and negative θ value after fitting the magnetization
curve. However, at lower temperature due to some alignment of the
spins from their normal position may result abrupt rise in magnetization
below 18 K.

Magnetic Study of 1b
The dc magnetic susceptibility
was measured on a crystalline sample of 1b under an applied
field of 1000 G in the temperature range 1.5–300 K using a
SQUID magnetometer. The χMT value
per two Mn(II) centers was found to be 8.34 cm3 mol–1 K at 300 K (Figure 4) which is lower than the spin-only value (8.68 cm3 mol–1 K) expected for a magnetically isolated
two high spin Mn(II) ions, indicating the occurrence of antiferromagnetic
coupling between the Mn(II) centers. On lowering the temperature,
χMT value gradually decreases to
5.13 cm3 mol–1 K at 33 K. However, on
further cooling, there is a sharp fall with a χMT value of 3.71 cm3 mol–1 K
at 2 K. Here, also similar to complex 1c, the magnetic
exchange occurs via H-bonding interaction between two Mn(II) octahedral
centers (both in high spin state) as no other superexchange pathway
present between metal centers. We try to fit the magnetization data
with Mn(II) dimeric equation using the Hamiltonian H = −2JS1S2. The best fit parameter thus obtained, J = −5.88 cm–1 with g =
2 with the agreement factor R = 1.86 × 10–4 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Plot of χM vs T and χMT vs T (inset) where red
line indicates theoretical fitting for compound 1b.

The value of the coupling constant
obtained for 1b by theoretical calculation was found
to be −2.3 cm–1. Thus, we can see that both
of our complexes show some unusual strong
magnetic interaction between two metal centers through only H-bonding
as there is no bridging ligand present between the metal centers.
At low temperature, the interaction is more prominent. For complex 1c, the magnetic interaction is quite interesting. Here, the
orbital contribution may arise either due to structural distortion
or may be spin state equilibrium operating in the molecule. The complex 1c also shows some sort of ferromagnetic ordering because
of spin canting at low temperature. On the other hand, complex 1b shows antiferromagnetic interaction between two isolated
Mn(II) centers through the same H-bonding. Though vast number of examples
is dominating in the literature with magnetic interaction through
superexchange pathway in the presence of bridging ligands between
paramagnetic centers, but magnetic coupling only by the operation
of H-bonding is very rare.66−69

Catalytic Cycloaddition of Carbon Dioxide
Complexes 1a–1c which are forming H-bonded
supramolecular 1D networks were tested as heterogeneous
catalysts for the
catalytic cycloaddition of carbon dioxide and the epoxides as shown
in Scheme 2 under solvent-free
condition.

Scheme 2 Catalytic Cycloaddition of CO2 and Epoxides 2a–2g by the Multicomponent Crystals 1a–1c as Heterogeneous
Catalysts and TBAB as a Cocatalyst
The reaction of six terminal epoxides 2a–f and
cyclohexene oxide (2g) with carbon dioxide to form the
corresponding cyclic carbonates 3a–g was investigated
using 0.016 mol % complexes 1a–1c and 0.09 mol
% TBAB under solvent-free conditions at 60–80 °C and 10
bar carbon dioxide pressure. Reactions were carried out for 10 h and
then analyzed by IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy to give a conversion,
and the cyclic carbonates were isolated and purified to give the chemical
yield. The results are shown in Table 3. In general, good to excellent yields were recorded
for carbonates 3a–3f except the cyclohexene carbonate
(3g). All cyclic carbonates were characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and ESI MS analysis (Supporting Information Figures S3–S23).
The cyclic carbonate 3b was characterized by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (Figure 5). 3b crystallized in the orthorhombic crystal
system (crystal data of 3b given in Table S2) in Pna21 space group.
The cell and data are transformed to be consistent with space group Pna21. The structure, however, is a 75–25%
racemic mixture with its enantiomorph. The minor component stays as
a pseudo-mirror (parallel to ac-plane intersecting b axis at 1/4) related disorder of the major component.

Mechanistic Investigation
of the Catalytic Experiment for the
Synthesis of Cyclic Carbonates
In order to study the mechanism
of the cyclic carbonate synthesis and to know the role of the catalyst,
the reaction was monitored via 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra (Figure 6) of the Zn-based catalyst 1a in DMSO-d6 show the peaks between 7.9 and 7.3 ppm corresponding
to the aromatic H-atoms of 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine and phenyl
rings of benzoate and a peak at 4.6 ppm corresponding to the methylene
protons of the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine. Whereas the 1H NMR in DMSO-d6 of the regenerated catalyst
obtained by washing the residue from the reaction of CO2, propylene oxide, 1a, and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide
several times with dry dichloromethane and diethyl ether show the
peaks between 8.1 and 6.7 ppm corresponding to the aromatic H-atoms
of 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine and phenyl rings of benzoate and
a peak at 4.5 ppm corresponding to the methylene protons of the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine.
The peaks at 5.66, 5.41, 4.67, and 0.98 ppm correspond to the peak
for the intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate attached
to one of the Zn-metal center of the catalyst 1a, and
those at 4.74, 4.44, 3.92, and 1.05 ppm are of the propylene carbonate
itself binding to the Zn-metal center of catalyst 1a.
This is supported by the fact that the peaks corresponding to propylene
carbonate appear more upfield between 4.9 and 4.0 ppm (Figure S29) in 1H NMR as compared
to the intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate. The UV–vis
titration experiment of the catalyst 1a (5 × 10–5 M) with gradual addition of 10 μL of propylene
oxide (1 × 10–1 M) in DMSO (Figure S25) shows the clear binding of the propylene oxide
with the catalyst 1a, having isosbestic point at around
280 nm; however, the stoichiometric addition of 1a, propylene
oxide, and TBAB in DMSO-d6 gives the 1H NMR signal which is devoid of considerable chemical shift
for the propylene oxide (Figure S28) which
might be due to very weak binding interaction of the epoxide substrate
with respective metal center in catalyst 1a. The upfield
shift corresponding to the aromatic protons of the regenerated catalyst
as compared to the original catalyst may be attributed to the reorientation
of the benzoate rings in 1a because of binding of the
intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate, as shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Mechanism of Cyclic Carbonate Formation Involving Catalyst 1a, CO2, and NBu4Br
The density functional theory (DFT) calculation70 was also carried out with the zinc complex 1a. The optimized structures showed the lowest energy in the
case of
binding of the substrate propylene oxide with the cationic zinc center
(1a+) instead of the binding
with anionic zinc center (1a–) (Table 4). Hence, it is the
cationic zinc center which can actually bind the substrate epoxide.
Ring opening of the substrate epoxide and subsequent insertion of
CO2 can give the intermediate 1-bromo propan-2-yl hydrogen
carbonate. The geometry optimized structure 1a′ clearly shows the binding interaction of the carbonate anion of
intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate with the cationic
zinc center by replacing one of the hydroxyl methyl substituents of
one of the bound 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine ligand (Table 4). Hence, from DFT studies,
we get the idea that the epoxide substrate may bind with the cationic
metal center and with subsequent insertion of CO2 may give
the respective intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate
attached to the cationic metal site by displacing one of the hydroxyl
methyl group. Taking account the geometry optimized structures and
correlating the previous report70 on the
mechanistic study with monometallic complexes, we can finally propose
the probable reaction mechanism as in Scheme 3. As all of the three complexes 1a–1c are having identical X-ray structures with just different transition-metal
ions, hence the catalytic mechanism of cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide by these complexes is supposed to be remain same which
indeed is reflected experimentally. The regenerated catalysts 1a–1c isolated from the reaction of cyclo-addition
of CO2 and propylene oxide were tested for recyclability,
and all of the three catalysts showed catalytic activity up to at
least one cycle with small loss in TON (Figure S27).

Table 4 Conclusions
We
have synthesized three new set of multicomponent crystals of
complexes 1a–1c which have been fully characterized
by X-ray single-crystal structure determination. One component constitutes
the dicationic metal complex of 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine ligand,
whereas the other component is dianionic metal tetrabenzoate of the
same metal. Intermolecular H-bonding interaction between the hydroxyl
H-atoms of dicationic component with the benzoate carboxylate oxygen
atoms of the dianionic component gives rise to 1D supramolecular chain
in 1a–1c. The manganese (1b) and
cobalt complexes (1c) show interesting antiferromagnetic
interaction between the paramagnetic metal centers through the H-bonding
exchange pathway. Complexes 1a–1c showed heterogeneous
catalytic activity for the conversion of epoxides to cyclic carbonates
in the presence of CO2 and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide
cocatalyst with turnover numbers greater than 1000 except in the case
of cyclohexene carbonate where the catalytic turnover is less. The
cyclic carbonate 3b was characterized by X-ray single-crystal
structure determination. The mechanistic study with catalyst 1a and propylene oxide showed the clear involvement of the
catalysts in the reaction with the regenerated catalyst 1a getting bound to the intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate
as observed via NMR, whereas UV–vis titration studies show
the initial binding of the epoxide substrate to the catalyst 1a. DFT calculations revealed the involvement of the cationic
zinc center during the catalysis with the intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl
hydrogen carbonate replacing the hydroxyl methyl substituent of one
of the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine ligands. The binding of the
intermediate 1-bromopropan-2-yl hydrogen carbonate to the catalyst 1a as observed by the 1H NMR studies is a proposed
structure of the species isolated, and more investigations are underway
in order to confirm its structure. Hence, 1a–1c which are multicomponent crystals play useful roles as heterogeneous
catalysts in the conversion of epoxides to cyclic carbonates in the
presence of the green house gas CO2.

Experimental Section
All synthetic procedures were performed under normal atmospheric
conditions. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300
MHz NMR spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were referenced internally
to residual solvent peaks, and chemical shifts are expressed relative
to tetramethylsilane, SiMe4 (δ = 0 ppm). Fourier
transform infrared spectra were recorded with an IRAffinity-1S Shimadzu
spectrophotometer. ESI MS was recorded in a high-resolution mass spectrometer,
AGILENT QTOF 6520. Microanalyses were carried out with a PerkinElmer
2400 CHN analyzer. Magnetic studies were conducted with a Quantum
Design Physical Property Measurement System with model 6000; Magnet14Tesla;
temperature range 1.8–400 K. 2,6-Bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine,
tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, and all of the epoxides were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Zinc nitrate, manganese acetate, cobalt chloride,
and methanol were purchased from local chemical company.

General Synthesis
Scheme for the Synthesis of 1a–1c
In
a round bottom flask, the respective metal salts, 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)pyridine,
and sodium benzoate were taken in 1:1:2 ratio, followed by the addition
of 1:1 methanol–water mixture. Then, the resulting solution
was heated to reflux for 3 h. After cooling, this solution was kept
for slow evaporation which gave the crystals of 1a, 1b, and 1c after one week. All of the complexes
can be directly precipitated from the respective reaction mixture
by the vacuum evaporation of methanol. The powder data simulated from
single-crystal X-ray data and the experimental powder data of the
precipitated complexes closely resembles each other (Supporting Information Figure S26A–C).

X-ray diffraction
data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer equipped
with a graphite monochromator and a Mo Kα fine-focus sealed
tube (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data integration was done using SAINT.
Intensities for absorption were corrected using SADABS. Structure
solution and refinement were carried out using Bruker SHELXTL.71,72 The hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically, and all of the other
atoms were refined anisotropically. N–H and O–H hydrogens
were located from difference electron density maps, and C–H
hydrogens were fixed using the HFIX command in SHELXTL. Molecular
graphics were prepared using X-SEED68 and Mercury licensed version
3.9.69.

Computational Details of Magnetic Studies
Heisenberg–Dirac–van Vleck spin Hamiltonian has been
found to be effective for the description of magnetic properties of
dinuclear transition-metal complexes. The exchange interaction between
two magnetic centers is derived from the spin coupling Hamiltonian
given in eq 1, where J12 is the spin coupling constant and S1 and S2 are spin
operators for the two respective metal centers.73 1  

Here, we have used the broken-symmetry
(BS) approach of eq 2 for the DFT-based calculation
of the exchange coupling constants given by Yamaguchi.74 2  where EBS, EHS and ⟨S⟩BS2,
⟨S⟩HS2 are energy
and average spin square values for the BS
and high-spin (HS) determinants, respectively. Positive and negative
values of J correspond to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
coupling, respectively.

All of the calculations have been carried
out in Gaussian 09 program
with hybrid functional (B3LYP) in combination with Ahlrichs’
split valence and triple-ζ TZVP basis set. In both the systems
(Co and Mn), the BS systems are found to be more stable than the HS
state, indicating antiferromagnetic coupling. The J values for the two systems (Co and Mn) are −84 and −2.3
cm–1, respectively. For the geometry optimization
of the studied complexes, we have employed DFT-based methodology with
the B3LYP functional75 in conjugation with
Hay and Wadt’s double-zeta effective core potential (LANL2DZ)76 as a basis set. These sets of functional and
basis set work well for the transition-metal complexes. All of the
optimization computations have been performed in Gaussian 09 suite
of program.77

General Procedure for Catalyst
Screening at 70 °C and 10
bar Pressure
An epoxide (2 gm, 34.45 mmol), catalyst 1a (5 mg, 0.0056 mmol), and Bu4NBr (10 mg, 0.0311
mmol) were placed in a stainless steel autoclave fitted with a magnetic
stirrer bar, and the reactor was heated to 70 °C after being
charged with 10 bar pressure of carbon dioxide. The reaction mixture
was stirred for 10 h at this temperature and pressure. The conversion
of epoxide to cyclic carbonate was determined by analysis of a sample
by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Cyclic carbonates 3a–3g are all characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR
as well as ESI MS and IR spectroscopy (figures in Supporting Information file).
