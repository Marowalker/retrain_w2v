Single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have received much attention
because of their potential in optoelectronic applications. Pristine
SWCNTs exhibit substantial van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic
characteristics, so precipitation occurs immediately in most organic
solvents and water. Highly toxic and hazardous chemicals are often
used to obtain well-dispersed SWCNTs. Developing environmentally friendly
processing methods for safe and practical applications is a great
challenge. Here, we demonstrate direct exfoliation of SWCNTs in pure
water only with n-type semiconducting fullerene nanoparticles. The
resultant SWCNTs can be well-dispersed in water, where they remain
essentially unchanged for several weeks. Adding an aqueous solution
of p-type semiconducting water-soluble polythiophene yields self-assembled
p/n heterojunctions between polythiophene and the nanoparticles. The
aqueous-dispersed SWCNTs yield photocurrent responses in solution-processed
thin films as a potential application of water-dispersed carbon nanomaterials.

Introduction
Single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs) are cylindrical structures
with exceptional electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties1,2 and may contribute to future emerging technologies, including flexible
and wearable electronics.3 Solution-processed
SWCNTs can be easily upscaled to large-area and high-throughput production
through well-established spin-coating, drop-casting, and inkjet printing
techniques.4 Development of exfoliation
and dispersion in large quantities at low cost and preferably with
clean processing is crucial for the preparation of solution-processed
thin-film devices. Unfortunately, SWCNTs form bundles and then immediately
precipitate in pure water because of their extended hexagonal lattice
of sp2-bonded carbon atoms.

Physical modification
is a “soft” dispersion approach
because dispersion is achieved using noncovalent interactions between
SWCNTs and dispersants.5,6 The dispersants are attached to
the surface of the SWCNTs through hydrophobic or delocalized π
stacking interactions, so there is minimal perturbation of the SWCNT
electronic structure. Water is a good candidate for green exfoliation
methodology7 because it is a biologically
safe and abundant solvent. From a green-processing point of view,
aqueous exfoliation of SWCNTs has been achieved using water-soluble
surfactants,8 polymers,9,10 nanocarbon
materials,11,12 proteins,13 DNA,14 and peptides.15

In the current study, we develop a clean
processing method for
“direct” exfoliation of SWCNTs in pure water with n-type
semiconducting fullerene nanoparticles composed of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM; Figure 1a) for the first time. Because
PC61BM nanoparticles are directly attached to the surface
of SWCNTs, a well-dispersed solution can be obtained as a result of
electrostatic repulsion of the adsorbed nanoparticles on SWCNTs in
water. Further adding an aqueous solution of p-type semiconducting
water-soluble polythiophene (WSPT) gives rise to a ternary composite
with self-assembled p/n heterojunctions consisting of WSPT and the
PC61BM nanoparticles. The resultant composites show photocurrent
responses in solution-processed thin films upon illumination. This
simple and green exfoliation method is expected to be suitable for
printing and coating, offering a clean processing of thin-film devices.

Results and Discussion
Nanoparticle-Induced Dispersion
of SWCNTs in Pure Water
PC61BM nanoparticles were
prepared by modifying a previously
reported method.16Figure 1b shows a transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of the PC61BM nanoparticles. The sample was
prepared by casting the dispersion onto a TEM grid. An average nanoparticle
diameter of 24 nm was estimated from 200 nanoparticles in the TEM
image. The size distribution of the PC61BM nanoparticles
was investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), as shown in Figure 1c. DLS indicated
an average nanoparticle diameter of 28.8 nm, with a narrow polydispersity
index (PDI) of 0.19 in water. To evaluate the stability of PC61BM nanoparticles in water, the time-dependent changes in
their average size and PDI were investigated. The PC61BM
nanoparticles remained unchanged after 6 months of storage at room
temperature (Figure 1d). We also prepared PC61BM nanoparticles with different
sizes by varying the experimental conditions (Table S1). TEM images and DLS profiles indicated that nanoparticles
with diameters ranging from 28.8 to 106.2 nm could be obtained by
changing the treatment temperature and the concentration of PC61BM in the mother solution. No significant changes in the
sizes of these nanoparticles were observed after 6 months, and their
PDI values remained in the range of 0.11–0.21. However, precipitation
occurred in water when the concentration of the mother tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solution exceeded 1.0 g L–1.

To clarify
the stability of the PC61BM nanoparticles in water, the
zeta potential (ζ) of the aqueous dispersions was measured.
A negative ζ value of −41.4 mV was obtained for the aqueous
dispersion of PC61BM nanoparticles. This suggests that
the PC61BM nanoparticles exhibited a stable dispersion
because of electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the methyl ester
group in PC61BM tends to form hydrogen bonds with water.
The interaction between PC61BM and water has been recently
investigated using molecular dynamics simulation.17 Radial distribution functions indicated that the distance
between the ester group and water (5.4 Å) was smaller than that
between the fullerene core and water (8.5 Å) because of hydrogen
bonding. The methyl ester group may therefore promote a stable aqueous
dispersion by forming a hydration network through hydrogen bonding
at the surface of the PC61BM nanoparticles.

We then
investigated the aqueous exfoliation of SWCNTs using 30
nm diameter PC61BM nanoparticles. Adding raw SWCNTs to
an aqueous dispersion of PC61BM nanoparticles and subjecting
to ultrasonication formed aqueous-dispersed SWCNTs (Figure S1). TEM images were carefully analyzed to evaluate
the dispersion behavior of SWCNTs because ultrasonication for extended
durations and/or under harsh conditions can result in very short SWCNTs
(5–10 nm).18,19 Judging from TEM images collected
from samples with various SWCNT concentrations, small bundles of SWCNTs
with diameters of 6–8 nm yielded after ultrasonication. These
results suggested that five or six SWCNTs gave rise to entangled structures.
Though stable dispersion of SWCNTs was observed in water, we could
not find individual SWCNTs (Figure S2).

The color of the dispersion changed from yellow to dark gray with
increasing SWCNT concentration (Figure S1). This change in absorption spectra was consistent with those expected
from the electronic structure of SWCNTs in the visible and near-infrared
(NIR) regions (Figure 2a).20 To determine the limit of the dispersion
ability of the PC61BM nanoparticles in water, the relationship
between absorbance and SWCNT concentration was investigated using
the Beer–Lambert law (Figure 2b). The Beer–Lambert law is a linear relationship
between the absorbance and concentration of a medium and is defined
as A = εcl, where A, ε, c, and l are
the absorbance, molar absorption coefficient, concentration, and optical
path length, respectively. It was assumed that a good dispersion of
SWCNTs occurs if a linear relationship is maintained between A and c. For analysis, we selected two
absorption peaks at 600 and 1178 nm, which correspond to the first
optical transition of metallic SWCNTs (M11, 400–620
nm) and the first optical transition of semiconducting SWCNTs (S11, 940–1350 nm), respectively.21 Linear relationships between A and c were observed until the binary composite contained 100 wt % SWCNTs,
with coefficients of determination (R2) of >0.992 for M11 and S11 transitions. Figure 2b shows that a decrease
in slope occurred when the concentration of SWCNTs exceeded 100 wt
%. This observation may reflect the saturated dispersion of SWCNTs
in water. Precipitation was observed at high concentrations of SWCNTs
because of their inevitable aggregation.22

nm (blue) and 1178 nm (red) as a function of the SWCNT concentration
of PC61BM/SWCNTs. (c) SEM image of a binary composite film
(PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:50 w/w) on an aluminum oxide membrane.

As mentioned above, a negative
ζ value of −41.4 mV
was measured for the PC61BM nanoparticles in water. ζ
values for aqueous dispersions of the binary composites (PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:X w/w) were slightly lower. The
ζ values were −26.5, −32.1, and −30.7 mV
for X = 10, 50, and 100, respectively. These results
suggest that PC61BM nanoparticles retained stable dispersion
properties after being attached to the surface of SWCNTs. Figure 2c shows a scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of a binary composite film (PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:50 w/w) on an aluminum oxide membrane. This
SEM image reveals that aggregated SWCNTs were dispersed into small
bundles by the PC61BM nanoparticles after forming the binary
composite film.

Unfortunately, we could not find the origin
of the dispersion ability
of PC61BM nanoparticles for SWCNTs in water. One possibility
is that the hydrophobic interaction between fullerene and SWCNT surfaces
gives rise to the dispersion of SWCNTs at the molecular level.12 Hilmer et al. reported that fullerene derivatives
tend to adsorb onto the SWCNT surface, leading to individually dispersed
SWCNTs. By contrast, the large size of our nanoparticle might not
penetrate into the individual SWCNTs with diameters of 1–1.3
nm because the diameter of the PC61BM nanoparticle was
more than 40 times larger than that of the C60 molecule
(0.71 nm). The 30 nm diameter nanoparticle is the smallest as per
our present protocol described above. We believe that a smaller diameter
of a nanoparticle is expected to be beneficial for the effective dispersion
of SWCNTs in water.

Self-Assembled Formation of p/n Heterojunctions
in Water
Figure 3a shows the
chemical structure of WSPT. The synthetic procedure for WSPT is described
in Supporting Information. The number-average
molecular weight (Mn) and PDI [weight-average
molecular weight (Mw)/Mn] were 16 500 and 2.0, respectively, as determined
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards
and THF as an eluent. The thermal properties of the polymer were characterized
using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry
(Figure S3). WSPT is readily soluble in
water and common solvents such as THF and chloroform.

were Cu Kα lines originating from the TEM grid. (g)
Magnification of EDS spectra of Figure 3f.

Figure 3b shows
the aqueous dispersion behavior in water. Raw SWCNTs formed a precipitation
because of untangled bundles (Figure 3b(i)). Adding raw SWCNTs to an aqueous dispersion of
PC61BM nanoparticles formed dispersed SWCNTs (Figure 3b(ii)). PC61BM nanoparticles were found to be attached to the surface of SWCNTs
(PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:4 w/w) in a TEM image (Figure 3c). From 100 nanoparticles
in the TEM image, the average size of the PC61BM nanoparticles
was estimated to be 29.9 nm (Figure 3d). This value is consistent with the average size
of the PC61BM nanoparticles estimated from the TEM image
in Figure 1b (24 nm).

Following the addition of WSPT, an aqueous dispersion of the ternary
composite (WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:100:4 w/w/w) was observed
as a homogeneous dispersion, as evidenced by the scattering of a 633
nm HeNe laser beam (Figure 3b(iii)). Coassembled structures of WSPT and PC61BM nanoparticles are apparent in the TEM image (Figure S4a). The average size of the nanoparticles in the
ternary composite (29.8 nm) was comparable to that in the binary composite.
Similar size distributions for the binary and ternary composites revealed
no obvious deformation of PC61BM nanoparticles upon coassembly
with WSPT (Figures 3d and S4b). To clarify the formation of
the ternary composite, we examined energy-dispersive X-ray spectra
(EDS) (Figure 3f,g).
Sulfur Kα lines (2.307 keV) arising from thiophene
rings were observed at points (ii) and (iii) in Figure 3g. The intensity of the signal for the Fe
Kα line (6.398 keV) originating from the residual
catalyst on the SWCNT surface [point (iii)] was much higher than that
observed at point (ii). This indicated that the signals measured at
point (iii) resulted from the ternary composite.

Characterization
We investigated the carrier generation,
separation, and recombination processes of WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNT
composite films using femtosecond-response transient absorption spectroscopy
(Figure 4, Supplementary Note 1). The absorption spectrum
of the ternary composite film exhibited an absorption maximum at 423
nm. This was attributed to the π–π* transition
of the polymer. Further weak absorption at 500–800 nm can be
attributed to electronic transitions of both PC61BM23,24 and SWCNTs25 (Figure 4a). After photoexcitation of WSPT at 400
nm, the transient absorption spectra of the ternary composite film
(WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:100:4 w/w/w) exhibited a maximum
at approximately 980 nm, which was attributed to WSPT polarons generated
on timescales shorter than the equipment resolution of 250 fs (Figure 4b). We observed transient
absorption peaks at approximately 720, 800, and 950 nm for SWCNT concentrations
of 0, 1, and 2 wt %, respectively (SWCNT concentrations in this article
refer to the weight percentage of SWCNTs to PC61BM). The
changes in the absorption peaks were attributed to different polarons
of WSPT in the solid state.26 This indicates
that the presence of SWCNTs might have caused the trapping of polarons
in the disordered structure. The decay dynamics were then observed
for the ternary composite film (WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:100:4
w/w/w) and were found to be affected by the excitation intensity (Figure 4c). Trapped polarons
underwent second-order hole–electron recombination because
electrons could reach neighboring polarons. The linear relationship
between the reciprocal half-life (τ–1) and
excitation intensity also suggests second-order recombination on the
picosecond timescale (Figure S5a). By contrast,
the decay dynamics of the binary composite film (WSPT/PC61BM) were independent of the excitation intensity (Figure S5b). The presence of polarons resulted in geminate
recombination because electrons could not escape from their counter-holes
in the absence of SWCNTs. The maximum observed at 720 nm for the binary
composite film was attributed to more ordered polarons that existed
in the more ordered structure of this film (Figure S5c).27 Furthermore, the hole–electron
recombination process depended on the SWCNT concentration (Figure 4d).

data of the ternary composite at various light intensities using eqs

illustration of carrier separation, electron migration, and carrier
recombination of the WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs composite.

We theoretically analyzed the
transient absorption data of binary
and ternary composite films (Figure 4e, Supplementary Note 2).
The decay kinetics of the binary composite film (WSPT/PC61BM = 100:100 w/w) was obtained from the smoothed line of the scattered
data shown by the black line. The colored lines of the ternary composite
film (WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:100:4 w/w/w) were calculated
using eqs 5 and 6 by assuming that the
concentration of electrons at time zero is proportional to the light
intensity. The theoretical model indicates the effective transport
of electrons through SWCNTs. The electrons were able to escape geminate
recombination by electron transfer to SWCNTs, but the recombination
with the counter-holes surrounding SWCNTs could be induced by the
electron transfer. The former effect was dominant if both the concentration
of SWCNTs and light intensity were low so that the SWCNTs were likely
to be not surrounded by counter-holes. This is consistent with slightly
slow transient decay observed for the WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs
composite film (100:100:1 w/w/w) compared to the binary component
and ternary components with higher concentration of SWCNTs (Figure 4d).

Energy
levels of WSPT, PC61BM, and SWCNTs were estimated
using absorption spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy performed
in air (PESA) (Figure S6). WSPT and PC61BM had highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of
−5.52 and −5.87 eV under vacuum, respectively (Figure S6a,b). The energy band gaps of WSPT and
PC61BM in the films were 2.40 and 2.06 eV, respectively,
as determined from Tauc plots.28 The lowest-unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of WSPT and PC61BM were
calculated to be −3.12 and −3.81 eV under vacuum, respectively.
This energy difference between the LUMO of WSPT and the HOMO of PC61BM is the driving force for the dissociation of excitons
upon photoirradiation. The work function of SWCNTs was also estimated
to be 5.04 eV using PESA, which is comparable with the values reported
in the literature (Figure S6c).29 We summarized photoinduced carrier generation,
migration, and recombination processes in the WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNT composite film (Figure 4f).

Photocurrent Response of the Aqueous-Dispersed
SWCNT Solutions
Water-based exfoliation processes will be
potentially clean and
cost-effective, and aqueous-dispersed SWCNTs with p/n heterojunctions
can be exploited to observe photocurrent responses. To explore this
hypothesis, thin films (thickness: 630 nm) were prepared by casting
SWCNT-dispersed solutions as aqueous inks on interdigitated gold electrodes
(Figure 5a, Supplementary Note 2). Upon air mass (AM) 1.5
simulated solar irradiation from the backside of the quartz substrate,
the ternary composite film exhibited a photocurrent of 8.3 nA at 1
V (Figure 5b). Introducing
SWCNTs into the composite films led to an increase in photo-to-dark
current ratio (Iphoto/Idark) values for SWCNT concentrations of up to 1 wt %
(Figure 5c). Iphoto/Idark then
decreased sharply with further increases in the SWCNT concentration.
By contrast, the dark conductivity (σ) of the ternary composite
gradually increased with increasing SWCNT concentration (Figure 5d). We repeated these
experiments using the WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNT films at least
twice for each concentration of SWCNTs. The resultant films exhibited
good reproducibility and consistent concentration dependence of σs.

film containing a SWCNT concentration of up to 1 wt %. (iii) Ternary
composite film containing a SWCNT concentration of greater than 1
wt %. Purple and green arrows indicate hole- and electron-transport
pathways, respectively.

We assumed that changes in Iphoto/Idark values were primarily caused by
changes
in the SWCNT network in the active layer (Figure 5e).30 The Iphoto/Idark value
for the WSPT/PC61BM binary composite was only 1.2 (Figure 5c). This low value
reflected the limited number of electron-transport pathways and suggests
that hole–electron recombination was dominant at the interface
of WSPT and the PC61BM nanoparticles through the p/n heterojunctions
(Figure 5e(i)).31 Increasing the SWCNT concentration to up to
1 wt % formed an SWCNT network in the active layer. This caused an
increase in the Iphoto/Idark value because of the formation of electron-transport
pathways (Figure 5e(ii)).32 Increasing the SWCNT concentration above 1 wt
% resulted in a decrease in the Iphoto/Idark value because of the electron–hole
recombination of the photogenerated carriers (Figure 5e(iii)). This explanation is supported by
the transient decay kinetics and second-order electron–hole
recombination (Figure 4d and S5a). Fast carrier recombination
processes occurred when the SWCNT concentration was 2–4 wt
%.

To evaluate the effects of the SWCNT network, the photoresponse
behavior of a ternary composite containing aggregated SWCNTs was examined
as a control experiment (Figure S7). The Iphoto/Idark values
of the resultant ternary composites were comparable with those of
the WSPT/PC61BM binary composite. Good SWCNT dispersion
was necessary for a good photocurrent response with effective carrier-transport
pathways in the ternary composite. Low σ values of approximately
1 × 10–9 S cm–1 were obtained,
even though SWCNTs were incorporated into the ternary composite. This
is because the hole–electron recombination occurred as a result
of limited carrier-transport pathways.

Hilmer et al. successfully
demonstrated that the amphiphilic fullerenes-SWCNTs
heterojunctions exhibited electron transfer in water.12 They found that relative rate constants of electron transfer
depended on the fullerene structures: lipid-C61-polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and lipid-C71-PEG showed incomplete fluorescence
quenching, indicating that the driving force for electron transfer
is small. By contrast, lipid-C85-PEG gave rise to the complete
quenching of SWCNT fluorescence. The increase in quenching efficiency
was consistent with the deeper LUMO level of lipid-C85-PEG
in comparison with lipid-C61-PEG and lipid-C71-PEG. In our composites, electron transfer on the picosecond timescale
occurred in the presence of SWCNTs (Figure 4). Furthermore, the energy relationships
between the LUMO of PC61BM (−3.81 eV) and the work
function of SWCNTs (−5.04 eV) are crucial for carrier recombination
in the ternary composite films. These results suggest that carrier
recombination rates can be tuned using fullerene derivatives showing
the different LUMO levels. Researchers have also reported the effects
of SWCNTs in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) composed of poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT) and PC61BM. Specifically, increases in the current
densities of OPVs were observed at an SWCNT concentration of 1 wt
% compared with OPVs containing no SWCNTs. This increase was attributed
to the introduction of electron transport capability. By contrast,
the current density decreased at a high SWCNT concentration of 3 wt
%, which was due to bimolecular recombination in the presence of metallic
SWCNTs.33 Others have reported that P3HT/PC61BM OPVs exhibit improved device characteristics when they
contain 1 wt % SWCNTs because of rapid electron transfer through SWCNTs.34 The current experimental results indicate that
the percolation threshold is likely to be in the SWCNT concentration
range 1–1.5 wt %. Because the supernatant of the PC61BM/SWCNTs binary composite was used as the mother liquor for the
ternary composite, it was difficult to achieve precise control over
the SWCNT concentration in our experiments. We assumed that the ternary
composite had a percolation threshold at an SWCNT concentration of
approximately 1 wt %.

The fullerene nanoparticle-assisted dispersion
of SWCNTs in water
is a good candidate for clean exfoliation methodologies because no
complex instrumentation and harmful chemicals are required to form
finer SWCNT bundles under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the key
function of the semiconducting PC61BM nanoparticles results
in the formation of sophisticated p/n heterojunctions by simple step-by-step
mixing in water. The modification of the nanostructure is expected
to lead to superior photoelectric conversion for future investigation.
For example, the exciton diffusion length of fullerenes via the triplet-excited
state is estimated to be 8–14 nm,35 so we expect that PC61BM nanoparticles 10–15 nm
in diameter will exhibit ideal carrier-transport properties in the
coassembled nanostructures. Furthermore, narrow-band gap semiconducting
polymers can provide NIR-responsive photodetectors for nondestructive
imaging applications.36 Our findings indicate
that aqueous-dispersed semiconducting inks are promising for printing
and coating materials with simple and clean processing methodologies
for future cost-effective industrial and commercial applications.
For example, the aqueous processing can potentially allow the fabrication
of semiconducting materials for use in high-performance devices. Furthermore,
the direct aqueous dispersion of SWCNTs is also applicable in applications
such as bioimaging and biosensing, and in medicinal applications that
prohibit the use of harmful organic solvents. Water is a chemically
stable, biologically safe, and environmentally friendly solvent. This
unique processing method contributes to green chemistry and engineering.
Evaluation of water-processed flexible thermoelectric devices prepared
with aqueous-dispersed SWCNTs using nanoparticle-formed fullerenes
is ongoing.

Conclusions
In conclusion, PC61BM nanoparticles were used as an
n-type semiconducting dispersant of SWCNTs in water. SWCNTs could
be dispersed at up to 100 wt % in water using this noncovalent bonding
methodology, and the dispersion behavior remained unchanged after
several weeks. Adding an aqueous solution of the p-type conjugated
polymer WSPT formed coassembled p/n heterojunctions consisting of
WSPT/PC61BM nanoparticles on SWCNTs. The p/n heterojunctions
in the ternary composite exhibited electron transfer on the picosecond
timescale. The all carbon-based composite films exhibited photocurrent
responses, upon AM 1.5 irradiation.

purification. Synthesized compounds were purified using flash column
chromatography [CombiFlash Companion, Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE,
USA; column: Kanto Silica Gel 60 (spherical: 63–210 μm),
Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan]. Deuterated chloroform was
purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Tewksbury, MA,
USA). The high-pressure catalytic CO (HiPCO) SWCNTs were purchased
from Nano-C Inc. (Westwood, MA, USA; 70 wt % carbon with >85% SWCNTs,
1.0–1.1 μm length, 0.9–1.3 nm diameter) and were
used as received. The metallic residue in the raw SWCNTs was estimated
to be 18% using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry.
PC61BM was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).

General Procedure for Preparing Aqueous-Dispersed
PC61BM Nanoparticles
PC61BM (10 mg)
was dissolved
in THF (10 mL) at room temperature. After filtration using a membrane
filter (pore size: 0.45 μm), the resultant solution (1 g L–1, 10 mL) was added dropwise to water (100 mL). To
remove the THF, the solution was purged with nitrogen for 3 h, which
yielded the aqueous dispersion of PC61BM nanoparticles.
The concentration of PC61BM nanoparticles in this aqueous
dispersion was 0.1 g L–1. Detailed protocols of
various experimental conditions are described in Table S1.

PC61BM/SWCNTs Binary Composites
A suspension
of raw SWCNTs in water (0.1 g L–1, 0.1 mL) was added
to the aqueous dispersion of PC61BM nanoparticles (0.1
g L–1, 10 mL). The mixture was sonicated for 15
min using a tip-type ultrasonic homogenizer (Branson Sonifier 250,
Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT, USA; power output: 40 W) in a water
bath at 25 °C. The resultant solution was allowed to stand overnight,
and then the binary composite composed of PC61BM/SWCNTs
(100:1 w/w, 10 mL) was collected as the supernatant without filtration.
Binary composites with different SWCNT concentrations were also prepared,
at concentrations of up to PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:200 w/w.
For high SWCNT concentrations above PC61BM/SWCNTs = 100:10
w/w, the mixtures after ultrasonication were centrifuged at 5000g for 5 min to remove large bundles of SWCNTs. A homogeneous
binary composite was obtained from the supernatant. The binary composite
film was prepared by filtration of the supernatant onto an aluminum
oxide membrane with a pore size of 0.1 μm (Anodisc, SPI Suppliers/Structure
Probe Inc., West Chester, PA, USA).

WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNTs
Ternary Composites
WSPT
in water (5 g L–1, 100 μL) was added to the
aqueous dispersion of the binary composite (PC61BM/SWCNTs
= 100:1 w/w, 5 mL) to yield the WSPT/PC61BM/SWCNT ternary
composite (100:100:1 w/w/w) without filtration. Ternary composites
were also prepared using raw SWCNTs solutions at concentrations of
0.0001–0.004 g L–1. In a control experiment,
samples were obtained by simply mixing WSPT, PC61BM, and
SWCNTs in water, without dispersion treatments such as ultrasonication
and centrifugation. Precipitation occurred immediately in water because
of the large bundles of SWCNTs.
