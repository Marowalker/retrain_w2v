Inhalable, noncombustible cannabis
products are playing a central
role in the expansion of the medical and recreational use of cannabis.
In particular, the practice of “dabbing” with butane
hash oil has emerged with great popularity in states that have legalized
cannabis. Despite their growing popularity, the degradation product
profiles of these new products have not been extensively investigated.
The study herein focuses on the chemistry of myrcene and other common
terpenes found in cannabis extracts. Methacrolein, benzene, and several
other products of concern to human health were formed under the conditions
that simulated real-world dabbing. The terpene degradation products
observed are consistent with those reported in the atmospheric chemistry
literature.

Introduction
Terpenes and terpenoids
are present in such a wide diversity of
environments (nature, food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and drugs)
that their consequences for inhalation toxicology cannot be ignored.
Additionally, their inclusion in flavored electronic cigarettes1 and ubiquitous presence in inhalable cannabis
products are of particular concern. The medicinal and psychoactive
effects of cannabis have been proposed to be enhanced by terpenes,
a phenomenon known as the “entourage effect”,2 and these relatively unsubstantiated assertions
of benefits have led the cannabis industry to place a heavy emphasis
on these aroma compounds.

Terpenoid degradation in the context
of cannabis has not been extensively
studied;3,4 however, it has attracted attention in the
context of atmospheric chemistry.5,6 For instance,
the reactions of terpenoids with O3 and NOx are well-known, but they are not directly applicable
to e-cigarettes or inhalable cannabis products. However, these and
other studies of pyrolysis and combustion of terpenoids should serve
as a starting point toward understanding the reaction pathways in
consumer vaporization devices. Despite the growing popularity of flavored
e-cigarettes and terpene-enriched cannabis extracts, the chemical
profiles of their terpene degradation products have not been evaluated
in detail.

Of very recent concern is the practice of dabbing,
which has emerged
as a dangerous and rapidly growing trend in cannabis consumption.
It consists of inhaling the vapors produced by placing a small amount
of cannabis extract (a “dab”) on a small heated surface
(the “nail”), which is connected to a water pipe.7 Its delivery of harmfully large amounts cannabinoids8,9 represents a potential danger to consumers, but little is known
about the toxicants the process may produce.

The principal extract
used in dabbing is butane hash oil (BHO).
BHO is a resinous, nonpolar extract of the cannabis made using butane
as a solvent.10 BHO has active ingredient
(tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol) contents ranging between
50 and 90%,8,11 with terpene content ranging
from 0.1 to 34% (unpublished). Myrcene is unequivocally the most abundant
terpene in cannabis, followed by limonene, linalool, pinene, caryophyllene,
and humulene; however, the plant can contain up to 68 additional terpenic
compounds in trace amounts.12 Additionally,
some consumers increase the terpenoid content by dipping BHO in a
vial of terpenes prior to use (“terp dipping”).13

BHO is made by passing butane over cannabis
buds and leaves, and
subsequently “purging” the butane from the product under
vacuum at room temperature or in an oven. Different nuances in its
processing can lead to slightly different consistencies, which take
on terms such as shatter, budder, crumble, pull-and-snap, wax, and
so on. In all of its forms, the extract is a sticky, resinous substance
similar to the oleo-resins of other plants.14 Because the process does not involve heating the extract to the
point that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, the native form
of this substance found in the plant) decarboxylates (unpublished)
into the active THC, BHO is not orally active and must be vaporized
for the users to achieve its effects.15

BHO production started out as a dangerous “backyard-chemist”
style operation that is famous for causing numerous explosions and
house fires. Through the course of legalization, the production has
steadily gained sophistication. The most modern, legal extraction
laboratories live up to the OSHA standards with full ventilation and
butane recovery. Modern techniques also include steps to “de-wax”
the product by dissolving the crude BHO in isopropyl alcohol and chilling
in a freezer, and, finally, filtering off the precipitated waxes in
a process known as winterization. Many subtleties in its production
exist, but many remain secretive due to the highly competitive nature
of the cannabis marketplace and the general inability of extract producers
to file patents due to the drug’s legal status at the federal
level.

In addition to butane extraction, supercritical CO2 extraction
has gained traction due to the fact that is does not leave any trace
of hydrocarbon solvents in the end product.16 The cannabis extract made by this method, colloquially known as
CO2 oil, has a lesser viscosity than BHO, a property that
allows it to be used in vaporizer pens on its own with no cutting
agents. The lesser viscosity is due to the fact that the supercritical
extraction process requires the product to be first decarboxylated
(heating in an oven at 100+ °C),17 leaving an extract consisting of all THC (an oil at room temperature)
and no THCA (a solid at room temperature). CO2 oil is generally
more expensive than BHO and mostly present on the market in prefilled
vaporizer cartridges and not commonly as a standalone extract for
dabbing. Because this extraction method does not leave residual hydrocarbons,
it has been named, along with alcohol extracts, as the only allowable
medical extracts to be sold under the medical cannabis regulations
in New York,18 Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

According to a recent survey,11 the
main reasons for using dabs are that less material is needed to get
the desired effect and a “cleaner high.” Consumers consider
dabbing to be a form of vaporization, and, therefore, view it as easier
on the lungs than smoking.19 However, little
information exists on the prevalence of dabbing. From 213 BHO extraction
laboratories in the 17 states raided in 2014, 2015 saw a steep increase
in the number of laboratories raided to 337 in 26 states.20 An analysis of the Twitter content related to
dabs found a greater popularity in the states that have legalized
recreational and/or medical cannabis.21

Different types of nails, the surface on which vaporization
occurs,
exist on the market. Use of an electrically controlled nail (“e-nail”)
allows temperature control; but, more commonly, users heat the nail
(made of titanium, ceramic, or quartz) with a crème brulee
torch22 and have no temperature control.
A minority of dabbers use lower temperatures to preserve flavor, whereas
a majority use higher temperatures to assure complete vaporization
with no wasted material. E-nail users posting online cite a preferred
temperature around 710 °F (378 °C), but cite a range from
340–482 °C.23−25 Raber et al. reported a dabbing
temperature of 300 °C, but this was only an (low) estimate. The
boiling point of THC has recently been predicted to be ca. 417 °C,26 but vaporization can occur at temperatures lower
than this by the use of a “carb cap” that reduces pressure
on its surface during inhalation.27

This study is an initial effort toward assessing the safety of
dabbing cannabis extracts. Due to the fact that these consist of a
complex mixture, we have begun our focus on terpenoids, the component
we predict to be the most thermally labile. To study dabbing, we carefully
recreated the inhalation topography and temperatures employed by users.
The study described herein is the first to investigate the degradation
products from dabbing and is focused on the terpene fraction of the
extracts used by consumers.

Results and Discussion
Sample Generation and Product
Identification
We investigated
the dabbing temperature ranges (TRs, Figure 1) inclusive of and beyond the ranges of those
reported by the users. The vapor collection and analysis methods were
based on those by Jensen et al.28 using
an impinger filled with NMR solvent for vapor collection. In the dabbing
simulation experiments herein, the vapor generated from the heated
ceramic nail connected to a water pipe passed through a cold trap
followed by the impinger. The impinger was, in turn, connected to
a smoking machine that generated the airflow. Degradation products
from myrcene, limonene, linalool, and Fire OG cannabis terpenes, a
commercially available mix specifically fabricated for terp dipping,
were monitored.11 The presence of methacrolein
(MC) and benzene in vapor NMR samples was confirmed by spiking with
authentic samples (Supporting Information). Their levels were quantified by NMR using an internal standard.

generated in a 40 mg dab using myrcene as a model terpene
assuming a 5.9% concentration of terpenes in BHO. Temperature values
represent the Tm for each TR. Error bars
are determined at the 95% confidence level using the standard deviation
of the three replicates taken at each TR. At the lowest TR, MC was
not detected by NMR.

In addition to the NMR method, the dabbing vapor was collected
using an adsorption/thermal desorption (ATD) cartridge and analyzed
using an automated adsorption/thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (ATD–GC–MS) method similar to that in Pankow
et al.29 Additional product structures
(Scheme 1) were assigned
by the GC–MS analysis. Other minor products that have been
previously described in the literature30 were also tentatively identified in the chromatographs (Supporting Information). Air blanks were collected
and analyzed using each of the NMR and the ATD–GC–MS
methods.

Scheme 1 Terpene Degradation Products Identified via the GC–MS
Analysis
1, Methacrolein; 2, methyl vinyl
ketone; 3, hydroxyacetone; 4, 3-methylfuran; 5, 2-methylnapthalene;
6, 1,3-butadiene; 7, 1-methylcyclohexa-1,4-diene; 8, benzene. These
and other related products were produced from pure samples of each
of limonene, linalool, and myrcene.

Temperatures
in dabbing experiments were carefully monitored for
consistency using a thermographic camera. As the first drop in terpene
touched the nail, an initial temperature (Ti) was recorded. Once a 10 s draw concluded, a final temperature (Tf) was recorded (the nail cooled between 50
and 30 °C during the draw due to convection). A median temperature
(Tm) was calculated and averaged for each
replicate to afford a representative Tm for each TR.

The 1H NMR spectra from the dabbing
samples displayed
peaks characteristic of a range of organic acid, aldehyde, and aromatic
products. The two products appearing in high abundance in the spectra
were the toxins benzene and MC (Scheme 1, Table 1). MC is a well-known degradation product of isoprene,5,31,32 which is itself a known degradation
product of myrcene33 and other terpenes.34 Benzene, alkyl benzenes, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons are known to form during terpene thermolysis. For example,
benzene has been observed as a degradation product in the synthesis
of myrcene by the pyrolysis of β-pinene,35 and it is also a product of solanesol pyrolysis.34 Benzene has also been detected in cannabis smoke.36

Product Quantification
Given the wide diversity of
the terpenes present in BHO, the relatively high abundance of myrcene
and the similarity of the products from each of the terpenes studied
(Table 1 and Scheme 1), we focused on
myrcene as a model terpene in evaluating the effect of temperature
on the yields of MC and benzene. Assuming 40 mg as an average size
dab,22 each dab contains 2.36 mg of terpenes,
which is based on an average concentration of terpenes of 5.9% in
BHO (unpublished data). The amount of MC obtained per dab based on
these calculations is displayed in Figure 1.

Because dabbing topography has not
been previously investigated, we chose an inhalation volume of 338
mL and a 10 s duration to assure a more complete collection of vapor.
The concentrations of MC in ppb per dab in this regime are 185 ±
11 ppb at Tm = 526 °C, 157 ±
2 ppb at Tm = 455 °C, 131 ±
9 ppb at Tm = 403 °C, and undetectable
at Tm = 322 °C.

Benzene was
not detected below the highest TR. Using the same rationale
as above for MC emission, one dab of BHO delivers 17 ng of benzene.
Represented as a concentration in the draw volume, this value is 15
± 1.8 ppb.

Degradant Toxicology
MC’s
property as a noxious
irritant is unsurprising due to its structural similarity to acrolein,
a powerful pulmonary irritant37 and an
air pollutant of great concern. Ambient concentrations of MC outside
of Stockholm were determined to be 0.06 ppb, whereas those at different
urban locations in Stockholm were 0.11, 0.13, 0.19, and 0.71 ppb.38 MC’s effect on the respiratory tract
in mice has shown it to be a potent irritant, indicating its threshold
limit value should not exceed 0.3 ppm.39 Nøjgaard et al. reported changes in the blink frequency during
eye exposure to MC at a concentration of 100 ppb and proposed a LOEL
of 286 ppb.40 These conflicting reports
indicate that the safe levels of MC are yet to be determined.

Unlike MC, the toxicology of benzene has been thoroughly evaluated.
Although benzene is a ubiquitous pollutant, the concentrations of
benzene found in the dabbing terpenes at the highest TR are far greater
than those found in ambient air. The average concentration of benzene,
a potent carcinogen, in U.S. air, measured over 137 different sites
is 0.313 ppb (313 ppt),3,41 and is correspondingly the “largest
single known cancer-risk air toxic (sic).”42

Degradant Formation Mechanism
We
propose that the formation
of MC and benzene occurs via isoprene as an intermediate (Scheme 1). The GC–MS
spectra of limonene, linalool, and myrcene all displayed significant
peaks tentatively assigned to isoprene, which suggests that these
terpenes, the major terpenes in BHO, break down to their isoprene
monomers before further degradation.

Studies of the atmospheric
chemistry of isoprene have shown that it reacts with hydroxyl radicals
and O2 to form not only MC and HCHO but also methyl vinyl
ketone and 3-methylfuran. The GC–MS analysis of each pure terpene
studied afforded a tentative identification with a high match quality
of MC, methyl vinyl ketone, and 3-methylfuran, as well as 1,3-butadiene
and several cyclic and acyclic dienes, polyenes, and aromatics (Scheme 1 and Supporting Information).

Limitations
The
main limitation of this study is the
fact that the concentrations of MC and benzene determined are likely
underestimated. One reason may be the relatively large draw volume
used. In addition, the temperature-dependent concentration values
were extrapolated from myrcene, which afforded the lowest yield of
degradation products of all of the terpenes investigated. Another
factor potentially contributing to the underestimation of yields is
transfer inefficiency resulting in the potential losses of terpenes
and their products. For example, the average myrcene recovery (8.7
± 0.7 mg) was low compared to the amount delivered onto the nail
(59.6 mg). Although this low yield of terpenes in the NMR sample was
initially attributed to their limited solubility in DMSO-d6, dabbing experiments using CDCl3 also had
low yield by NMR. This may not be due entirely to degradation. Transfer
inefficiency in dabbing has been previously described.22

Conclusions
Given the widespread
legalization of cannabis in the United States,
it is imperative to study the full toxicology of its consumption to
guide future policy. The results of these studies clearly indicate
that dabbing, although considered a form of vaporization, may in fact
deliver significant amounts of toxic degradation products. The difficulty
users find in controlling the nail temperature put users at risk of
exposing themselves to not only methacrolein but also benzene. Additionally,
the heavy focus on terpenes as additives seen as of late in the cannabis
industry is of great concern due to the oxidative liability of these
compounds when heated. This research also has significant implications
for flavored e-cigarette products due to the extensive use of terpenes
as flavorings. Future research will also be directed toward assessing
the contribution of terpenoids to the existing toxicant formation
in e-cigarettes. Additionally, the methods discussed herein will also
be used to further study the degradation of cannabis extracts used
in dabbing and cannabis e-cigarettes.

Methods
Materials
Terpenes included myrcene ≥95%, stabilized,
FCC, FG (Sigma-Aldrich); (R)-(+)-limonene analytical standard (Sigma-Aldrich);
linalool ≥97%, FCC, FG; and Fire OG terpene mix (Blue River
Extracts).

NMR Experiments
Air is drawn at
a constant rate using
and the Single Cigarette Smoking Machine (SCSM-STEP, CH Technologies)
calibrated to pull 338 mL air during a 10 s dab. A HIVE Domeless Element
10 mm ceramic nail (HIVE Ceramics) was attached to a small dab water
pipe (Zion Cannabis in Portland, OR). For each separate experiment,
the water pipe was filled with 20 mL of fresh 200 ppm solution of
NaCl Biological, Certified Crystalline (Fisher Scientific) in HPLC
grade water (Honeywell).

Terpene (15 μL) was delivered
per dab using a Hamilton 50 μL analytical syringe. Five dabs
were done per experiment. The vapor was collected through a cold trap
chilled with isopropyl alcohol/dry ice at −77 °C, proceeded
by an impinger containing 750 μL of DMSO-d6 + 0.05% v/v tetramethylsilane (99.9%, Cambridge Isotope).
After the experiment was concluded, the cold trap was washed with
the NMR solvent in the impinger and collected quantitatively using
an Eppendorf P1000 pipette in an NMR tube. The water pipe and the
cold trap were connected by 5 cm of 1/2 in. outer diameter ACF0027-F
Tygon S3 E-3603. The end connected to the water pipe was wrapped in
Teflon tape to make it fit snugly. The cold trap and the impinger
were connected by 3.5 cm of 1/2 in. outer diameter ACF0027-F Tygon
S3 E-3603. The impinger and the SCSM were connected by 5 cm of 3/8
in. outer diameter ACF0017-F Tygon S3 E-3603. The tubing was discarded
after every experiment, so sorptive losses were consistent with every
experiment.

All of the NMR samples were spiked with 10 μL
of a 17.33
mM solution of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloronitrobenzene (TCI Chemicals) in
DMSO-d6 using an Eppendorf P10 pipette.
This standard solution was made by adding 11.23 mg of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloronitrobenzene
to 3 mL of DMSO-d6.

Myrcene dab
NMR experiments at each TR (Figure 1) were performed in triplicate. Terpene experiments
shown in Table 1 were
performed once each. The exact conditions used in recording the NMR
spectra are presented in the SI.

ATD–GC–MS
The same water pipe (containing
20 mL 200 ppm solution of NaCl) and the same ceramic nail were connected
to an ATD cartridge with 5 cm of 1/2 in. outer diameter ACF0027-F
Tygon S3 E-3603 wrapped in the Teflon tape to make a seal and then
attached to 5 cm of 3.5 cm of 3/8 in. outer diameter ACF0027-F Tygon
S3 E-3603, also wrapped with Teflon tape on the end to assure an air-tight
seal. The other end of the ATD cartridge was connected to the SCSM-STEP
using 5 cm of 3.5 cm of 3/8 in. outer diameter ACF0027-F Tygon S3
E-3603. The ATD cartridges used contained 100 mg of 35/60 mesh Tenax
TA and 200 mg of 60/80 mesh Carbograph 1 TD (Camsco Inc., Houston,
TX). The same dabbing topography used in the NMR experiments were
used in the ATD cartridge sample collections. This high flow rate
exceeds that normally used for these cartridges, but this was allowed
due to the fact that these experiments were only used for product
identification and not quantification. The conditions used in the
ATD cartridge analysis are explained in the SI.

Thermography
The temperature of the nail was acquired
real time by the infrared thermography using an FLIR T450sc 2.0 (FLIR
Systems). The emissivity of the ceramic nail was determined experimentally
to be 0.9 by comparing it to the known value of insulating electrical
tape, 0.97. The reflected temperature was determined by the reflector
method to be 23 °C. The TRs used in the NMR experiments are shown
in Figure 1, and the
TR used in the ATD–GC–MS experiment was the second hottest
TR with a Tm of 455 °C. All of the
temperature data for each experiment are presented in the SI.
