A calix[4]arene conjugate (L) functionalized at the lower
rim with a benzofurazan fluorophore (NBD) and at the upper rim with
a thioether moiety has been synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry techniques.
Both the absorption and emission spectral data for L in
different solvents exhibited progressive changes with an increase
in polarity. Ion recognition studies were performed by absorption
and fluorescence spectroscopy using 10 different metal ions. Among
these, Hg2+ exhibited greater changes in these spectra,
whereas Cu2+ showed only significant changes and all other ions showed no change in the spectral features.
Although the Hg2+ has dominant influence on the spectral
features and provides a detection limit of 56.0 ± 0.6 ppb, the
selectivity was hampered because of the presence of the derivatizations
present on both the rims of L for ion interaction in
solution. Therefore, L was immobilized onto gold nanoparticles
(AuNPL’s) so that the upper rim derivatizations
anchor onto the gold surface through Au–S interactions, and
this leaves out only the lower rim NBD derivatization for interaction
with ions selectively. The AuNPL’s were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analyses. The surface characteristics were analyzed by contact
angle measurements. The AuNPL’s exhibit greater
selectivity and enhanced sensitivity for Hg2+ ions with
a lowest detection limit of 48.0 ± 0.8 ppb. The immobilization
of L onto AuNPs was reflected in the corresponding fluorescence
lifetime values, and the addition of Hg2+ to either L or AuNPL showed fluorescence quenching. The reversible
recognition of Hg2+ by L was demonstrated
by titrating L or AuNPL with Hg2+ followed by tetra-butyl ammonium iodide for several cycles. The
structural features of Hg2+-bound species were demonstrated
by density functional theory computations and were supported by the
XPS data. The Hg2+ induces aggregated fibrillar morphology
into supramolecular L, as demonstrated by microscopy when Hg2+ was
added either to L or to AuNPL, supporting
aggregation-caused quenching.

Introduction
Environmental contaminants,
such as heavy metal ions, have adverse
effects on living organisms.1 Among these,
the mercury contamination is potentially hazardous and it can be easily
converted into organomercury species such as methyl-mercury via biotic
and abiotic pathways and accumulates in living organisms.2−5 Exposure to methyl-mercury leads to cardiovascular and neurological
disorders, damages the DNA, and impairs mitosis.6−8 Therefore, simple,
rapid, and efficient chemosensors are needed to detect low levels
of mercury contamination in toxicological, biological, and environmental
samples. For this, calixarenes are important owing to their well-defined
structure and conformation and amphiphilic nature because they possess
an upper-rim hydrophobic core and lower-rim hydroxyl groups. Furthermore,
calix[4]arene is an ideal platform that can be easily modified by
attaching a suitable fluorescent binding core for the development
of colorimetric and fluorometric receptors for ion detection.9−13 A number of receptors are reported in the literature for Hg2+ ions;14−26 however, those based on the calixarene platform are scant.27−32 In the literature, benzofurazan (NBD) has been explored for its
fluorophoric property,33−37 though it is possible to use its N- and O-ligating centers for binding
transition metal ions. Therefore, it is of interest to observe the
selective ion binding properties of the fluorophoric NBD moiety when
appended onto the lower-rim arms of calix[4]arene owing to the supramolecular
nature of the resultant conjugates. To our knowledge, there are only
a few reports in the literature in which NBD is attached to the calix[4]arene
platform. However, the calixarene conjugates with bifunctional mode
and with the NBD moiety have not been explored in the literature and
hence the present study is of great relevance. Recently, the lower
rim of calix[4]arene was modified by the NBD moiety, where the conjugate
was used for the detection of either a cation, such as Ag+, or an anion, such as F– ions.38,39 In another report, four folic acid units are appended at the upper
rim and an NBD moiety at the lower rim of calix[4]arene, where the
conjugate was demonstrated to be internalized by the cancer cells.40 Because
of the requirement of special features for selective sensing of mercury, a bifunctional
calix[4]arene conjugate (L) was designed (Figure 1) to have a binding core within
a fluorophore at the lower rim while having −SMe terminals
at the upper rim. The upper rim −SMe terminals will help anchor
the molecule onto the noble metal surface such as gold to bring better
ion selectivity as we have already demonstrated that the anchoring
onto metal surface would bring sensitivity and/or selectivity in some
cases.41−44

Figure 1 Schematic
representation of the design of the receptor, L, and
its immobilization onto AuNPs.

L has been used as a sensor for Hg2+ and
Cu2+ ions in solution and only for the Hg2+ ion
when L is coated onto the surface of the gold nanoparticles
(AuNPL’s). While the receptor molecule tumbles freely
in solution, the same is immobilized when coated onto AuNPs and thereby
provides an access only to the lower-rim binding core. This is expected
to bring a difference in the sensitivity and selectivity of the receptor
toward the guest species on going from solution to that anchored onto
the AuNP surface.

Results and Discussion
The receptor L is synthesized by going through several
consecutive steps starting from p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene (C4A), as given in Scheme 1. All of the precursors and the receptor
molecule were characterized thoroughly (SI01). The presence of a pair
of doublets observed at 3.45 and 4.34 ppm in 1H NMR for
the bridge-CH2 of calix[4]arene in CDCl3 confirms
that calix[4]arene exists in cone conformation.

Physicochemical Studies of L Based on Spectroscopy
Because the absorption and emission characteristics of NBD are
known
to be dependent on solvent polarity,45 the
spectra of L were measured in different solvents, such
as n-hexane, carbontetrachloride, toluene, tetrahydrofuran,
dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide,
dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, ethanol, methanol, and water, and
the corresponding spectra are given in Figure 2a,c. The λabs or λem vs relative polarity plot exhibits generally an increasing
trend with increasing polarity of the solvents. We have made use of
the concept of relative polarity that has been reported in the literature.46,47 A comparison of the data for the two extremes of polarity, viz.,
CCl4 and water, supports that both the λabs and λem are red-shifted by 41 and 57 nm, respectively,
suggesting a positive solvatochromism for L. The emission
intensity of L is enhanced by 16-, 31-, and 40-fold in
ethanol, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran (THF), respectively, as
compared to its intensity in water (Figure S02). Thus, the solvent-dependent fluorescence intensity of L follows a trend, that is, water ≪ methanol < n-hexane < ethanol < dichloromethane ~ DMSO ~ carbontetrachloride
< toluene < DMF ~ acetonitrile < THF. Because the solvatochromic
behavior of L in ethanol is midway between the two extremes,
ethanol has been used as the solvent for further studies.

and fluorescence spectral traces of L, respectively,

Metal Ion Recognition by L in Ethanol Using
Spectroscopy
All of the solution studies of ion recognition
were carried out in ethanol. To evaluate the binding ability of L toward ions, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+,
fluorescence spectral titrations were carried out (Figure S03). During the titration of L with Hg2+, the fluorescence intensity is quenched, and the extent
of quenching is dependent on the concentration of Hg2+ added,
as can be noticed from Figure 3a,b. Initially, the color of the receptor L in
ethanol is yellow, and it turns to pinkish-orange upon Hg2+ addition. Because the Job plot exhibited a broad peak portion, the
complex formed between Hg2+ and L can be fitted
to either 1:1 or 1:2 (Figure S04a) and
the minimum detection limit for Hg2+ is 56.0 ± 0.6
ppb (141 nM) (Figure S12a). All of the
other ions showed no significant change in the fluorescence intensity
except Cu2+, where the intensity is enhanced by ∼15–20%
as compared to that of the receptor L alone (Figure S04b). The selectivity of Hg2+ has been addressed by carrying out the titration in the presence
of other metal ions as competitors, and no significant change in the
fluorescence intensity was observed, supporting that none of the other
ions compete for L when it is bound to Hg2+ (Figure S05a). This suggests that L can be used as a selective sensor for Hg2+ in
the presence of these metal ions studied.

ethanol during the addition of 0 to 10 equiv
of Hg2+. The inset shows the color of the solutions of L and {L + Hg2+}. (b) Plot of [M2+]/L vs fluorescence intensity at λ532 (nm).

The absorption spectrum of L in ethanol exhibits four
major bands at 210, 264, 335, and 465 nm, where the first two arise
from the calix[4]arene platform and the latter two arise from the
NBD moiety (Figure S05b). Among all of
the ions studied, Hg2+ showed maximum changes in the absorption
spectrum along with the formation of a new band at 530 nm at the cost
of the absorbance of the band at 465 nm. During this process, the
color of the solution changes from yellow to pinkish-red, supporting
the formation of the complex of L by Hg2+ (Figure 4a,b). All of the
other ions showed no significant change in the absorption spectra
of L (Figure S06), except
Cu2+ that showed marginal changes in the bands at 332 and
465 nm (Figure 4c).
The (A–A0) plot
for all of the three bands suggests that the Hg2+ selectively
interacts with L while generating a charge-transfer band
at ∼530 nm. However, no such charge-transfer band is observed
in the case of Cu2+, supporting the fact that L can uniquely detect Hg2+ over all other ions studied
on the basis of absorption spectroscopy and thus L is
selective for Hg2+ (Figure 4d). The effect of a counter anion on L has been studied by employing chloride, nitrate, acetate, and perchlorate
salts of Hg2+, and it was found that the fluorescence quenching
was half in the case of HgCl2 and Hg(NO3)2 as compared to that in the acetate and perchlorate salts
(Figure S05c). The sensitivity of L for the Hg(ClO4)2 salt does not alter
even in the presence of other salts possessing other anions, such
as chloride, nitrate, and acetate (Figure S05d).

Hg2+-Induced
Aggregation in L Studied by Microscopy
As the conjugates of calixarenes are known to exhibit supramolecular
features,48,49 the aggregation behavior of L was studied by SEM in both the presence and the absence of Hg2+. Because ethanol and THF have a larger polarity difference,
these were chosen as solvents for the preparation of the samples used
for microscopy studies. In ethanol, it was observed that L exhibits well-separated, rodlike structures of size 50–60
nm and that upon addition of Hg2+ aggregation is induced
in L, resulting in triangular shuttle-cock-like structures
(Figure S07a,b). In the case of THF, these
rods join together to form fibrillar structures (Figure 5a) and upon addition of Hg2+ dense and twisted fibrils were obtained, supporting ion-induced
supramolecular aggregation in L (Figure 5d). The fibril formation by L followed by aggregation in the presence of Hg2+ ions
was further proved by other microscopy techniques, such as TEM and
AFM. Similar to SEM, fibrillar structures of L in THF
were also noticed even in TEM and AFM (Figure 5b,c). In the presence of Hg2+,
the aggregation of the fibrils increases their density, and this is
very well supported by SEM (Figure 5e,f). Thus, the fluorescence quenching observed in L upon addition of Hg2+ is attributable to the
metal-ion-induced aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) as shown in Figure 5g.

L-Capped Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPL)
The receptor L was designed in such a way that the
two −SMe groups present at the upper rim of calixarene can
easily bind to the gold nanoparticles through Au–S interactions.
To study the ion selectivity of L on the surface, receptor L was coated using citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPcit’s) by the ligand exchange method, as given in the Experimental Section. Both the AuNPcit and AuNPL were characterized by absorption spectra, TEM,
XPS, and contact angle measurements, as given in Figure 6a,b. The AuNPcit shows an SPR band at 530 nm, indicating the formation of the nanoparticles.
The formation of AuNPL was confirmed by the presence of
both the SPR band at 530 nm and that of L at 465 nm,
supporting that the nanoparticles possess L. The EDAX
data given in Figure S08 supports the coating
of L onto the gold nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on AuNPL revealed atom
% of 8.5, 62.0, 20.0, 6.5, and 3.0, respectively, for Au, C, O, N,
and S, suggesting the grafting of the conjugate of calix[4]arene (L) onto AuNPs. The binding energies of Au 4f peaks observed
at 84.7 (4f7/2) and 88.1 eV (4f5/2) (Figure 6c) are in agreement
with the data reported for alkanethiols assembled on gold nanoparticles.50 The contact angle of the water droplet on AuNPcit is 15°, whereas it is ∼90° on the receptor L. When L is immobilized onto AuNPs to give AuNPL, the contact angle changes to ∼68°, supporting
the coating of L on AuNPs.

the wettability of the surface by contact angle measurements: 1. AuNPcit; 2. AuNPL; 3. L. (c) XPS spectra

Ion Recognition by AuNPL
Absorption spectral
titrations were carried out further to check the sensitivity and selectivity
of L-coated gold nanoparticles, viz., AuNPL, for divalent transition metal ions, viz., Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ (Figure S09). In solution, the receptor was sensitive and selective
for Hg2+ ions; however, it weakly interacted with Cu2+. When the same L was coated on nanoparticles,
viz., AuNPL, the sensitivity for the Hg2+ ions
was greater even when a lower concentration of Hg2+ was
added. Both the 464 and 530 nm bands showed a decrease in absorbance
initially, and the band at 530 nm completely diminished with an increase
in the Hg2+ concentration, and this is associated with
the formation of a new band at 615 nm, suggesting the aggregation
of AuNPL’s (Figure 7a,b). Whereas the Cu2+ titration with simple L shows considerable changes in the absorption spectra, in
the case of AuNPL, the same ion shows no significant change
in the absorbance; thus, the study supports enhanced selectivity for
Hg2+ of L upon anchoring onto the AuNP surface.
In all of the other metal ions studied, no absorption band was observed
at 615 nm, implying that no other M2+ forms a complex with
AuNPL (Figure 7e).

Figure 7 (a) Spectral traces obtained during the titration of AuNPL with Hg2+ by absorption spectroscopy. (b) Plot of the
absorbance vs [Hg2+]/[AuNPL] for the bands 465
(black), 520 (red), and 615 (blue) nm. (c) Spectral traces obtained

by fluorescence spectroscopy. (d) Plot of fluorescence intensity vs
[Hg2+]/[AuNPL]. (e) Plot of absorbance at 615
nm as a function of metal ions. (f) Plot of fluorescence intensity
as a function of metal ions.

Fluorescence spectral titrations were also carried out with
all
of these metal ions (Figure S10), and it
was observed that the intensity was quenched when AuNPL was titrated with Hg2+. The Hg2+ concentration
required for complete quenching is lower in the case of AuNPL as compared to that for simple L in solution, supporting
that the sensitivity of L is enhanced when it is anchored
onto the Au surface (Figure 7c,d,f). The detection limits obtained for Hg2+ on
the basis of the fluorescence intensity data by simple L and AuNPL are 56.0 ± 0.6 ppb (141 nM) and 48.0 ±
0.8 ppb (121 nM), respectively (Figure S11a,b). The data was derived on the basis of 3σ/m, where σ corresponds to the standard deviation of the blank
measurements and m is the slope of the plot of the
intensity vs concentration of the sample. Thus, the detection limit
for L is largely greater by 2σ when compared to
that observed for AuNPL, supporting that the detection
of Hg2+ by AuNPL is certainly more sensitive
than that by L. This indicates that when L is supported on a solid surface, its ion sensitivity increases.
Thus, the sensitivity of Hg2+ detection is greater by 115%
in the case of AuNPL as compared to that for the simple L. The effect of counter anion on AuNPL has been
studied by employing chloride, nitrate, acetate, and perchlorate salts
of Hg2+, and it is found that the fluorescence intensity
does not change to any significant extent, as can be noted from the
spectral traces (SI12, Figure S12).

The TEM micrographs of AuNPcit (Figure 8a) show spherical particles of size 17.1
± 3.8 nm. The HRTEM image and the diffraction pattern were also
obtained (Figure 8d,g).
Although the size of the AuNPs did not change after the addition of L, fibriltype structures were noticed in which the AuNPs were
dispersed onto these fibrils (Figure 8b,e,h). Upon addition of Hg2+ to AuNPL, the discrete particles connected the fibrils and the fibrils
were further aggregated, as can be seen from the TEM images given
in Figure 8c,f,i. The
crystallinity of the AuNPs decreased after coating of L on them, and the crystallinity was lost after the addition of Hg2+ (Figure 8g,h,i). The aggregation on AuNPL after addition of Hg2+ was further supported by SEM (Figure 8j–l) and the DLS data (SI13, Figure S13). The size distribution of AuNPL (340 ± 8 nm) measured by DLS clearly supported strong
aggregation when compared to that of the precursor AuNPcit, which showed only 32 ± 1 nm size particles. Upon addition
of Hg2+, the AuNPL’s further aggregated
by an order of magnitude higher, exhibiting an average size of 2470
± 20 nm. Thus, the aggregation is increased on going from AuNPcit → AuNPL → AuNPL+Hg2+ and finally
exhibits a fiberlike structure upon addition of Hg2+.

Reversibility
The reversible behavior of the sensing
of Hg2+ by L and AuNPL has been demonstrated by the titration of each of L and AuNPL with Hg2+ followed
by tetra-butyl ammonium iodide (TBAI) (Figure 9). As the iodide ion possesses greater affinity
for Hg2+, it forms a complex, [HgI4]2–, where the Hg2+ is removed from the [HgL] complex and
the resultant free L shows enhanced emission intensity. Further addition
of Hg2+ to this results in fluorescence quenching because
of the formation of [HgL]. With an increase in the concentration of
TBAI, the fluorescence intensity increases (Figure 9a) and the intensity regains the level that
it initially showed (when no Hg2+ ions was present), suggesting
a complete reversibility of the receptor and its Hg2+ complex.
Thus, the reversibility of the receptor L was shown for
four cycles and the corresponding data is given in Figure 9b. In this, the initial addition
of Hg2+ results in fluorescence quenching (OFF switch)
and upon addition of TBAI the fluorescence intensity is regained and
hence acts as fluorescence ON switch. The ON/OFF behavior of the receptor
is clearly seen by the changes observed in the fluorescence intensity,
and this is given in Figure 9b. The reversible nature can also be noticed from the visual
color change (SI14, Figure S14). Similar
titration studies were also carried out to show the reversibility
of L-coated nanoparticles (AuNPL) for sensing
of Hg2+, and it was found that AuNPL also shows
reversible behavior. This was shown for four consecutive cycles (Figure 9c,d). Thus, both
free L and surface-coated L, i.e., AuNPL, show reversible sensing of Hg2+.

a recycling experiment similar to that given under (b) but starting

Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements of L, AuNPL, and Its Hg2+ Complexes
Because the fluorescence
excited-state lifetimes are sensitive to the structure and dynamics
of a fluorophore, the decay profiles of receptor L and
those after anchoring it onto the gold nanoparticles (AuNPL) were measured, in both the absence and
the presence of Hg2+ using the time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC) method, as can be noticed from Figure 10. The decay data were found
to fit with triexponentials, resulting in three species. The triexponential
decay observed in the case of the calix[4]arene conjugate L would result from the conformational flexibility of the arms of
this supramolecular species, and the corresponding data including
the weighted average (τ) are given in SI15 and Table S01. The average lifetime “τ” of
the receptor L in ethanol decreases by 25% from 5.6 to
4.2 ns in the presence of Hg2+ ions. However, when L is coated onto the gold nanoparticles (AuNPL’s), the average lifetime of the
coated L decreases to 3.3 ns, supporting that the Au
surface quenches the fluorescence. When Hg2+ is added to AuNPL, the lifetime of the fluorophore
is further decreased to 2.8 ns and hence exhibits only 15% lowering
instead of 25%, which is observed in the case of free L, supporting that L is immobilized on the nanoparticle
surface.

Binding Nature of Hg2+ in the Complex by Computational
Study
The optimized structures for the receptor L and its 1:1 mercury ion complex [L – Hg2+] at the B3-LYP/6-31G(d,p)/SDD(Hg2+) level are
given in Figure 11a,b. As a result of the complexation of L by Hg2+, the 1:1 complex formed is stabilized by 331 kcal/mol and
the stabilization is 325 kcal/mol upon applying BSSE correction. In
the complex, the Hg2+ ion is stabilized by four noncovalent
interactions arising from two nitrogens and two oxygens by exhibiting
a coordination core of HgN2O2 (Figure 11c). All of these ligations
arise from both the NBD moieties attached as terminal units to both
the arms. Whereas the two oxygen ligations are from the two terminal
NO2 groups, the two nitrogen ligands are from the benzofurazan
moiety. All of the Hg···O (2.742 and 2.835 Å)
and Hg···N (3.072 and 3.200 Å) distances support
the noncovalent interactions present between Hg2+ and the
corresponding ligating centers on L. The angles in the
primary coordination sphere range from 55 to 138°, and the geometry
at the Hg2+ center is neither tetrahedral nor square planar
but fits relatively better to a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry
where one of the apical positions is vacant (Figure 11d). The structure of the complex thus obtained
from the computational study supports the changes observed in the
XPS data for 1s of N and O in comparison to those obtained for the
receptor (Figure 11). The interaction of the NBD moiety by Hg2+ observed
in the complex is expected to alter the absorption and emission spectral
characteristics of this moiety. Only in the titration of L by Hg2+, a new band is observed at ∼540 nm because
of the charge-transfer transition between NBD and Hg2+,
and the fluorescence intensity is quenched as expected because of
the heavy atom effect. Both the Mulliken and NBO calculations supported
the decrease in the charge at the metal center substantially when
Hg2+ interacts with L in the complex (SI16,
SI17, Figure S15, Tables S02, S03, and S04).

Figure 11 Computational results obtained at the B3-LYP/6-31G(d,p)/SDD(Hg2+) level of calculations: (a) optimized structure of L and (b) optimized structure of the complex, [L –
Hg2+]. (c) and (d) Primary coordination sphere around Hg2+ in the complex. The numbers shown in (d) correspond
to the metal–ligand distances in the coordination core in Å.
The bond angles of the coordination core (in degrees) are as follows:
O1HgO2 = 138; O1HgN1 =
55; O1HgN2 = 108; O2HgN1 = 126; O2HgN2 = 56; and N1HgN2 = 70. (e) Standard trigonal bipyramidal geometry with one
vacant site in the axial position. The hydrogens attached to the carbon
atoms are not shown for clarity (color coding for the atoms: cyan,
C; fluorescent green, N; dark green, H; purple, O; gold, S; and red,
Hg).

Because the Job plot is not decisive in determining whether the complex formed between Hg2+ and L is 1:1 or 1:2, two-layer ONIOM computations were performed
with the 1:2 complex as per the details given under the Experimental Section. The 1:2 complex thus optimized using
two-layer ONIOM computations has been given in SI18 and Figure S16, and the coordination core is given
in Figure 12. Whereas
the 1:1 complex is formed between the NBD moieties of both the arms
giving rise to the HgN2O2 core, the 1:2 complex
is formed between the arms of two molecules of L. Thus,
in the 1:2 complex, the HgN2O4 core is formed
using three NBD moieties of both the molecules in addition to the
involvement of upper rim arm amide “O” binding. Whereas
the geometry in 1:1 is distorted trigonal bipyramidal with a vacant
site, it is distorted octahedral in the 1:2 complex. In the 1:2 complex,
the Hg2+···N/O distances range from 2.162
to 2.688 Å and the angles range from 72 to 110 for the orthogonal
bonds and 155 to 177° for the trans bonds with average values
of 81 and 164°, respectively, all supporting a highly distorted
octahedral HgN2O4 core. Thus, the examination
of the Hg2+···O/N bond length data supports
that three of these are covalent, whereas all four Hg2+···O/N are noncovalent in the case of the 1:1 complex.
The single-point energy calculations carried out on the optimized
1:2 complex yield 25–30% greater stabilization for the HgN2O4 core over its 1:1 counterpart, i.e., the HgN2O2 core, and the increase is commensurate with
the number and nature of additional interactions present in the former.

N2–Hg–O1 = 72; N2–Hg–O2 = 87; N2–Hg–O3 = 103;
N2–Hg–O4 = 106; O1–Hg–O2 = 94; O1–Hg–O3 = 73;
O1–Hg–O4 = 155; O2–Hg–O3 = 159; O2–Hg–O4 = 111;
and O3–Hg–O4 = 84.

Supporting the Binding of Hg2+ in the Complex by
XPS Data
To validate the binding features noticed from the
computational study, XPS spectra were measured. From the XPS data,
it was observed that the binding energy peaks for N_1s and O_1s arise
from the benzofurazan moiety and that these were shifted upon Hg2+ addition. The N_1s band for L showed three
peaks upon deconvolution, and these peaks were observed at 405.97
(NO2), 403.30 (N–O–N), and 401.24 eV (CONH, NH) (Figure 13a,b). Upon addition
of Hg2+, the peaks from NO2 and N–O–N shifted to 404.37 and 403.12
eV, respectively, whereas the area under the N–O–N peak increased. Similar changes were also observed between
AuNPL and AuNPL+Hg2+ (Figure 13c,d) as expected. The O_1s
peak could also be fitted to three species in XPS spectra of L, and these were observed at 535.86 (NO2), 533.01 (N–O–N), and at 531.82 eV (CONH) (Figure 13e). Upon addition of Hg2+, the peak from NO2 was shifted from 535.86 to 534.07 eV and that observed
at 531.82 eV shifted to 532.14 eV with an increase in its area in
the case of L (Figure 13f), suggesting the interaction of Hg2+ with
the oxygen of the NO2 group. Similar XPS spectral changes
were observed between AuNPL and AuNPL+Hg2+ (Figure 13g,h) as expected.

Figure 13 XPS spectra of N 1s and O 1s: (a) and (b) for L; (c)
and (d) for AuNPL; (e) and (f) for L + Hg2+; and (g) and (h) for AuNPL+Hg2+. The
deconvoluted spectra are shown in different colors.

Conclusions and Comparisons
Di-Benzofurazan-appended
calix[4]arene (L) having
surface binding motifs at alternate positions of calix[4]arene has
been synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry (HRMS). In L, benzofurazan
has been used as both the fluorophore and the ligand that binds to
the metal ion. The highlights of all of the studies carried out to
demonstrate the physicochemical and the metal-ion-sensing aspects
of both L and AuNP-bound L (i.e., AuNPL) are listed in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation of the Physicochemical and
Sensing Features
of L and AuNPL
L has been shown for its solvent-dependent
absorption
and emission characteristics. With an increase in the polarity of
the solvent, the λabs or λem is
red-shifted. The recognition ability of the receptor L in ethanol has been studied with divalent transition metal ions
and some toxic ions. Among all of the metal ions, the receptor showed
strong interactions with Hg2+ and weak interaction with
Cu2+. The interaction of Hg2+ with L resulted in a visible color change from yellow to pinkish-red along
with the formation of a new band at 530 nm in absorption spectroscopy,
and the fluorescence intensity is quenched upon addition of Hg2+.

The interaction of the Hg2+ with L has
also been shown by TEM, SEM, and AFM microscopy techniques, which
suggest that the fibrillar structures of the receptor L are further aggregated upon addition of Hg2+, suggesting
the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) of L. Because
both the rim groups are exposed to the environment in solution, they
lead to a lower selectivity as they exhibit differential interaction
with Hg2+ vs Cu2+. Therefore, the receptor was
coated onto the gold nanoparticle surface (AuNPs) through Au–S
interactions using upper rim −SMe groups. As a result of this,
only the lower rim derivatizations are better exposed to the environment,
thus restricting the tumbling motion of the receptor L and thereby enhancing its selectivity toward ion sensing. The AuNPL’s were fully characterized by UV–visible spectrophotometry,
TEM, and XPS measurements. The elemental mapping done through TEM
further supported the presence of L on these AuNPs. The
hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the surface was probed by contact
angle measurements. Among all of the metal ions studied, AuNPL is selective for Hg2+ ions only, and the sensitivity
of the receptor increases upon immobilization of L onto
the AuNPs. This was also reflected in their minimum detection limits,
wherein simple L shows 56.0 ± 0.6 ppb, whereas the
AuNP-coated L, i.e., AuNPL, shows 48.0 ±
0.8 ppb; thus, a sensitivity increase of 15% was noticed. A comparison
of the literature reports on Hg2+ detection by calixarene
conjugates with the present one clearly supports that L shows lower detection limit and hence higher sensitivity toward
Hg2+.24,27−30,36 The fluorescence lifetime measurements clearly supported the anchoring
of L onto the AuNPs, and it was further reflected in fluorescence
quenching when either L or the AuNPL’s
were titrated with Hg2+ ions. Upon addition of the Hg2+ to AuNPL, the aggregated species were seen in
SEM and TEM, and this was further supported by the DLS data. The complexes
of L and AuNPL with Hg2+ are reversible
in nature. The reversibility studies have been performed using tetra-butyl
ammonium iodide with both the complexes, and as a proof of concept,
the reversibility was demonstrated for four cycles. The Hg2+ forms a noncovalent complex with L, wherein such interactions
are extended to N- and O-ligation from each of the arm using the NO2 and the NBD groups to result in a HgN2O2 coordination core as a species of sensing, as derived on the basis
of DFT studies. As the Job plot is inconclusive for suggesting the
formation of either 1:1 or 1:2, the latter was also modeled by computational
studies to have the HgN2O4 core. The structure
of the complex obtained from the computational studies was further
supported by the XPS data analysis. The physicochemical features including
solvatochromism, as well as the sensing features, for L and its surface-immobilized counterpart, viz., AuNPL,
can be easily understood from Scheme 2.

Experimental Section
The perchlorate
salts of all of the metal ions were procured from
Sigma-Aldrich. All of the solvents used for the spectroscopy studies
were of analytical reagent grade and were distilled and dried by standard
procedures immediately before use, Milli-Q water is being used. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR (400 MHz Bruker NMR Spectrometer),
ESI-MS (in positive ion mode on MaXis Impact-Bruker), UV–vis
absorption (Cary 100 Bio UV–Vis spectrophotometer), and fluorescence
emission (Varian-Cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer) spectra
were measured. Stock solutions of all of the metal salts were prepared
in ethanol at 6 × 10–4 M. All of the fluorescence
and absorption titrations were carried out in a 1 cm quartz cell using
100 μL of L, and the total volume in each measurement
was made up to 3 mL to give a final concentration of L of 20 μM. All of the fluorescence titrations were carried
out at λex = 465 nm. Excitation and emission slit
widths used were 2.5 nm, and a scan speed of 200 nm/min was used.
The fluorescence lifetimes were measured from time-resolved intensity
decays by the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique.
The light source used was a picosecond diode laser (Nano LED) at 440
nm (Horiba JobinYvon). The fluorescence decays were deconvoluted using
Datastation software for acquisition and IBH DAS6 for data analysis.
The signals were collected at the magic angle (54.7°). The decay
times were determined using the nonlinear least-squares method of
the TCSPC technique. The contact angle was measured by Digidrop (contact
angle meter model DS).

Microscopy Studies
All of the samples
for atomic force
microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) were prepared at 6 × 10–4 M in ethanol, and the solutions were sonicated for 10 min before
these were drop-casted and allowed to dry under an IR lamp. Whereas
the samples for AFM were prepared on a silicon wafer and SEM on aluminum
foil, those for TEM were prepared on a carbon-coated copper grid.

Computational Study
All of the calculations for the
conjugate of calix[4]arene (L) and its complex with the
Hg2+ ion were computed using the Gaussian 09 package.51 The model structure has been prepared by bringing
some modifications in the arm portions of a crystal structure reported
by us recently.52 Geometry optimization
has been performed in a cascade manner to obtain the lowest-energy
structure. In the first step, geometry optimization was carried out
at the PM6 level of theory, followed by the B3-LYP/6-31G(d,p) level
with zero-point energy correction to get the lowest-energy structure
of L. The optimized structure of L thus
obtained was used for its 1:1 complexation with Hg2+ by
appropriately placing this ion in the vicinity of the binding core.
The complex was optimized at the same level of theory with the application
of the SDD basis set and effective core potential on the transition
metal ion, Hg2+. The interaction energy was computed by
subtracting the single-point energy of each of the individual components
from the total energy of the 1:1 complex, all being treated at the
same level of theory.

As the peak in the Job plot is broad enough
to fit with either the 1:1 or 1:2 complex, even the 1:2 complex of
Hg2+ vs L was optimized using two-layered
ONIOM calculations.53 In this, the Hg2+ ion and the NBD units of both the calixarene molecules are
treated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/SDD(Hg2+) level of theory,
whereas the rest is treated under the semiempirical PM6 method. The
regions treated under ONIOM and DFT can be understood from the optimized
structure given in the Supporting Information (SI18, Figure S16). For the BSSE-corrected interaction energy calculations,
the obtained geometry of the 1:2 complex from the two-layer ONIOM
computations was subjected to single-point energy calculations at
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/SDD(Hg2+) level.

Synthesis and
Characterization of L
The
steps involved in the synthesis of L are given in Scheme 1. As the precursors
P1 to P5 were already reported by us,54 their characterization data are given in the Supporting Information (SI01). To a solution
of 7-chloro 4-nitro benzofurazan (0.2 g, 2.2 mmol) in dry ethanol,
P5 was added (0.95 g, 1.0 mmol) along with a catalytic
amount (0.1 mL) of pyridine. The reaction was stirred at room temperature
for 1 day. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the
residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using ethylacetate:
pet ether in 80:20 as eluting medium. Yield: 70%. ESI-MS: HRMS peak

C64H74N10O12S2 = 1277.4557 (calcd) and 1277.456 (obtained). 1H NMR (400

8.83.

Synthesis of AuNPcit
Citrate-capped gold
nanoparticles were synthesized using the procedure reported in the
literature.55,56 Aqueous solution of 0.25 mM HAuCl4 (100 mL) was heated in a conical flask. To the boiling solution,
3 mL of aqueous solution of 1% (w/w) sodium citrate was added. Heating
was continued approximately for 15 min until a ruby red color appeared,
which indicates the formation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPcit). The resulting AuNPcit’s were centrifuged at
6000 rpm for 15 min to separate them from excess citrate. The solution
pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 0.1 M NaOH. These AuNPcit were
characterized by TEM and UV–vis spectroscopy techniques.

Synthesis of AuNPL
Aqueous solution of AuNPcit (2 mL) was centrifuged at 8000 rpm, and the settled nanoparticles
were taken and dispersed in ethanol (2 mL). The receptor L (10 mmol) was dissolved in a minimum amount of THF (0.2 mL) and
was diluted with 1.8 mL of ethanol. The two solutions were mixed and
stirred for ∼2 h. The resulting solution was centrifuged at
7000 rpm, followed by dispersion in ethanol to remove the L present in excess, and washed with ethanol several times until the
wash liquor became colorless. The resulting NPs were capped by the
calixarene conjugate (AuNPL), and these were dispersed
in ethanol for further use.
