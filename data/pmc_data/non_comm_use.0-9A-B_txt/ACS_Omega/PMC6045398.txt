The glycolytic pathway
is one of the most studied metabolic pathways
to date. This work focuses on determining the standard Gibbs energy
of reaction (ΔRg0) of
the first adenosine triphosphate-yielding reaction step of glycolysis,
namely, the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) reaction. Trustworthy
values of ΔRg0 are required
for thermodynamic approaches to determine single reaction conversions
or even fluxes of metabolic reactions. In literature, the observed
ΔRg0,obs values are usually
determined directly from the experimental equilibrium composition
data without accounting for the nonideality of the reaction mixture.
That is the reason why the observed ΔRg0,obs values do not present consistent standard data as
they are a function of the concentration, pH, and pMg. In this work,
a combination of experimentally determined equilibrium composition
data and activity coefficients of the reacting agents was used to
determine ΔRg0 values
for the temperatures 303, 313, and 323 K at pH 7. The activity coefficients
were predicted with the thermodynamic model electrolyte perturbed-chain
statistical associating fluid theory (ePC-SAFT). The ePC-SAFT parameters
were taken from literature or fitted to new experimental osmotic coefficients.
At 313.15 K, a value for ΔRg0 of −16.2 ± 0.2 kJ/mol was obtained. This
value is about 4 kJ/mol less negative than what is usually considered
as an accepted standard value. The reason behind this discrepancy
was found to be the activity coefficients of the reacting agents,
which dramatically influence the equilibrium position of the PGK reaction.
On the basis of the temperature-dependent ΔRg0 values, the standard enthalpy of reaction
was determined and found to be ΔRh0 = −49 ± 9 kJ/mol.

Introduction
The glycolytic pathway represents the
primary metabolic pathway
for the oxidation of monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) to pyruvate in
mostly all organisms, yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the
process. The glycolytic pathway presents the best trade-off between
the metabolic rate, ATP generation, and resource requirements for
monosaccharide oxidation.1,2 The interest of understanding
the glycolytic pathway is also represented in the vast amount of literature
available, covering the enzymes, substrates, cofactors, and regulation
mechanics involved.3−8 Of further interest are accurate values for the standard Gibbs free
energy of reaction ΔRg0 and the standard enthalpy of reaction ΔRh0. With the knowledge of ΔRg0, the driving force of the reaction
can be calculated for any initial composition of the reaction mixture.
ΔRh0 can be used to calculate
ΔRg0 at different temperatures
knowing only one reference value. Data for enzyme-catalyzed reactions
covering ΔRg0 and ΔRh0 are reported in the literature
under the assumption of an ideal mixture, that is, neglecting the
activity coefficients of the reacting agents (γi = 1), which is regarded as a nonreasonable assumption
for flux analysis from a thermodynamic standpoint.9−11 At first glance,
this seems reasonable for an aqueous buffered solution of a low concentration
of reacting agents. However, previous publications showed that activity
coefficients are important even at very low concentrations. Meurer
et al.12 determined an activity-based value
for ΔRg0 of the hexokinase
reaction and Hoffmann et al.13 determined
ΔRg0 of the glucose-6-phosphate
isomerization reaction. In both publications, a concentration-independent
equilibrium constant Ka was obtained by
explicitly taking into account the activity coefficients of the reacting
agents.

This work is focused on the first ATP-yielding reaction,
namely,
the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) reaction. The reaction mechanism
is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Reaction Mechanism of the PGK Reaction
The
substrates are 1,3-BPG and
ADP, which are converted to 3-PG and ATP by the enzyme PGK.

Regarding literature data on the Gibbs free energy
of the PGK reaction,
Bücher14 as well as Krietsch and
Bücher15 provided a value of ΔRg0,obs = −20 kJ/mol for
a temperature of 298.15 K at pH 7; this value was calculated from
the measured equilibrium composition. Cornell et al.16 reported vastly different experimental data for a temperature
of 313.15 K at pH 7, leading to standard Gibbs free energy values
between −17 and −22 kJ/mol. This wide range of ΔRg0 values provided by Cornell
et al. can be explained by the different initial reaction conditions,
for example, substrate and cofactor concentrations. Further, a value
of ΔRg0,obs = −18.8
kJ/mol for 313.15 K calculated by group contribution methods is reported
in the literature.9,17,18 An overview of the available data is given in Table 1.

Table 1 Overview over the
Available Literature
Data of the Observed (Apparent) Gibbs Free Energy of Reaction ΔRg0,obs at the Respective Temperature
and pH

313.15	7	–19.3 ± 3.4	(16)	
313.15	7	–18.8	(9,17,18)	
From all the available data, it becomes obvious that
different
initial concentrations of substrates, temperatures, magnesium (cofactor),
and buffer concentrations cause different ΔRg0,obs values. Because a reliable standard value
for ΔRg0 poses the first
step into further investigations of the different cosolvent influences
on the reaction in cellulo, an activity-based thermodynamic equilibrium
constant Ka was determined in this work
by combining reaction equilibrium measurements with activity coefficient
values obtained with the thermodynamic equation of state electrolyte
perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (ePC-SAFT).

Theoretical
Background
The driving force of every (bio)reaction
is the Gibbs free energy of reaction ΔRg. It is defined as shown in eq 1 1  

In eq 1, νi and μi denote the stoichiometric
coefficient and
the chemical potential of the reacting agent i at
the respective temperature and pressure, respectively. The chemical
potential of a liquid component can be described by eq 2 with the chemical potential of
the pure component μ0i, the universal
gas constant R, the mole fraction xi of component i, and
the activity coefficient γi of component i. 2  

Equations 3–5 relate the Gibbs free energy of reaction ΔRg to the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction
ΔRg0 and the thermodynamic
equilibrium constant Ka. 3   4   5  

Equation 5 is the
fundamental basis for the calculation of biochemical pathways and
points to the importance of reliable values for ΔRg0. Instead of the classical chemical
expression that takes into account each individual species, eq 5 can also be expressed
biochemically by eq 6. The apostrophe in Ka′ denotes the use of the species-averaged
thermodynamic activities in contrast to the chemical definition of Ka, which is formulated in terms of true reacting
species that are present in the reaction mixture at the specified
reaction conditions. For the reaction considered, it shall be noted
that the main reacting agents are 3-PG2– and ATPMg22– for the reaction conditions in this work.
Nevertheless, Ka′ is then defined based on the sum of
species activities; this definition assumes that all activity coefficients
of all species of one component are equal. Equation 7 shows the expression for the biochemical Ka′ for the PGK reaction 6   7  

Equation 7 explicitly
accounts for activity coefficients to provide an activity-based value
for Ka′ with the reference state one molal hypothetical ideal
solution. Additionally to the mole fractions of the components, other
concentration scales such as molality and molarity can be used.19 The connection between those is given in eq 8. 8  

Activity coefficients related to molarity (γi,c) or to molality (γi,m) can be converted using
textbook thermodynamics.

The standard enthalpy of reaction ΔRh′0 can be calculated using
the temperature-dependent Ka′ values by the van’t Hoff eq 9. 9  

Assuming a temperature-independent
ΔRh′0, integration
of eq 9 leads to eq 10, from which a graphical
determination of ΔRh′0 is possible.20 10  

To calculate the activity coefficients required
for eq 7, the ePC-SAFT
equation of state
was used in this work. ePC-SAFT was developed and proposed by Gross
and Sadowski21 and extended by Cameretti
et al.,22 leading to an expression for
the residual Helmholtz energy ares, as
shown in eq 11 11  

In eq 11, the hard-chain
reference system is represented by ahc. The perturbations to the hard-chain reference system accounted
for ePC-SAFT are the molecular dispersive interactions, characterized
by the van der Waals energy represented in adisp and by the associative hydrogen-bonding forces aassoc. In the case of an electrolyte system,
which is considered in this work, the Coulomb interactions are expressed
by aion which is based on a Debye–Hückel
expression. The residual Helmholtz energy ares is used to calculate the residual chemical potential μires and the fugacity coefficient φi of each component i in the solution. On the basis
of the fugacity coefficients, the activity coefficients γi* were expressed in this work as 12  where the superscript ∞ denotes the
infinite dilution reference state. That is, eq 12 relates to infinite dilution at the same
temperature T and pressure p as
the actual solution of the composition x⃗.
Thus, Ka′ refers to the one molal hypothetically ideal reference
state, which assumes that all activity coefficients are equal to one.

Results and Discussion
Osmotic Coefficients of the System Water
+ 3-PG Disodium Salt
Experimental osmotic coefficient data
of the system water + 3-phosphoglycerate
(3-PG) disodium salt were used for fitting the ePC-SAFT parameters
for 3-PG2– and the binary interaction parameter
between water and 3-PG2–. The results of the measurements
of the osmotic coefficients at 273.15 and 303.15 K and the respective
modeling curves resulting from the parameter fit are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. For the modeling of the osmotic coefficients
with ePC-SAFT, the presence of Na+ has explicitly been
accounted for. The experimental results are listed in Table 2.

Equilibrium Constant of the PGK Reaction at 313.15 K
Reaction
equilibrium measurements were performed for five different
initial ATP concentrations between 1 and 20 mmol/kgwater. The results for the determined equilibrium composition ratio Kexp′ are shown in Figure 3. The initial concentration of 3-PG for all experiments was prepared
in equimolal ratio.

Figure 3 Equilibrium composition ratio Kexp′ vs the
molality of ATP
at equilibrium mATP,eq for different initial
substrate concentrations at 313.15 K (triangles).

As can be seen in Figure 3, Kexp′ strongly depends on the concentration,
that is, Kexp′ is not constant as usually assumed
in biochemistry. The equilibrium constant Ka′ equals Kexp′ only for conditions for which all activity coefficients are one.
This state exists theoretically if the concentrations of all reacting
agents approach zero. On the basis of extrapolation of Kexp′ to zero concentration, Ka′ will be about 520. For all other
concentrations, activity coefficients have to be accounted for. In
this work, activity coefficients were estimated using the ePC-SAFT
equation of state with the parameters listed in Tables 6 and 7. The results
of the predicted values of γi* of each reacting agents are shown
in Figure 4. It is
noteworthy that in this work, nine components of the reaction mixture
were taken into account [water, 3-PG2–, ATP, adenosine
diphosphate (ADP), Na+, Mg2+, Cl–, NH4+, and SO42–]. 3-PG2–, ATP, and ADP were considered as (averaged-species)
reacting agents, whereas NH4+ and SO42– were part of the enzyme suspension and were
regarded as impurities; these were also taken into account for the
prediction of Ka′. The enzyme was neglected for modeling
because its exact concentration was estimated to be between 0.3 and
0.03 mmol/kg. The exact concentration of the enzyme in the suspension
provided by Sigma-Aldrich was unknown/not provided.

coefficients of ATP (circles), ADP

initial substrate concentrations as listed in Table 5. Predictions in the multicomponent reaction
mixtures were performed using the parameters from Tables 6 and 7.

a MgCl2 was added in a
twofold molar excess to the ATP concentration for all samples. All
measurements were performed at pH 7 and at a temperature of 313 K.

In Figure 4, the
activity coefficient of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) is not shown.
Because the concentration of ADP and 1,3-BPG at equilibrium was at
least 25 times lower than the concentration of ATP and 3-PG, respectively,
the activity coefficients of ADP and 1,3-BPG were assumed to be one. Figure 4 shows that γ*
of 3-PG2– and ATP is decreasing with increasing
ATP concentrations, leading to a decrease in Kγ′.
Access to Kexp′ and Kγ′ allows
determining the activity-based equilibrium constant Ka′.
The results are shown in Figure 5 and Table 3.

Figure 5 Calculated activity-based equilibrium constant Ka′ (circles)
from the equilibrium composition ratio Kexp′ (triangles)
and the ePC-SAFT predicted activity coefficient ratio Kγ′ (squares) using the parameters from Tables 6 and 7.

Comparing the values of Kexp′ and Ka′ in Figure 5 and Table 3, the importance of
taking activity
coefficients of the reacting agents into account becomes clear. Although Kexp′ and Kγ′ are strongly concentration-dependent, Ka′ is a constant value within the error bars. The manifestation of
a trustworthy activity-based equilibrium constant of the reaction
in pure water is necessary because it allows for prediction concentrations
and cosolvent influences, which are needed to understand the complexity
of cellulo systems. On the basis of Ka′, a value
for ΔRg0′ at 313.15
K was determined to be ΔRg0′ = −16.18 ± 0.19 kJ/mol.

A comparison to the data
of Cornell et al.16 at 311.15 K further
highlights the importance of the thermodynamic
activity. The experimental data presented in the work from Cornell
et al.16 lead to a value of ΔRg0′ = −19.34 ±
3.38 kJ/mol. This value is not a standard value but an apparent value,
which explains the scatter in the data and the discrepancy to the
value obtained in the present work. Unfortunately, the temperatures
in this work and in the work of Cornell et al. are slightly different.
Thus, quantitative comparisons require activity-based equilibrium
constants at the same temperature. For this, the standard enthalpy
of reaction ΔRh0′ is required.

Standard Enthalpy of Reaction
The
standard enthalpy
of reaction was determined in this work by a linear regression of
the van’t Hoff plot resulting from eq 10, assuming that ΔRh0′ is temperature-independent. For this
purpose, Ka′ values were determined at three temperatures:
303, 313, and 323 K. For the temperatures of 303 and 323 K, a measurement
of one equilibrium composition was performed for an initial substrate
molality of 10 mmol/kgwater of ATP and 3-PG. The results
of the measurements are listed in Table 4. The results are also illustrated in Figure 6.

van’t Hoff eq 10 of ln (Ka′) over 1/T for the
temperatures 303, 313, and 323 K to determine the standard
enthalpy of reaction.

a MgCl2 was added in a
twofold molar excess to the ATP concentration for all samples. All
measurements were performed at pH 7.

As can be seen from the linear regression in Figure 6, the assumption
of a temperature-independent
value of ΔRh0′ is reasonable between 303 and 323 K for the PGK reaction. From the
slope of the regression (equals −ΔRh0′/R), the standard
enthalpy of reaction was determined to be ΔRh0′ = −49.19 ± 9.4 kJ/mol.
The relatively high uncertainty arises from taking into account the
uncertainties in the Ka′ values using a Taylor series
for error estimation.

Because no literature data for ΔRh0′ of the PGK reaction
are available, a validation
of the determined value is not possible. Nevertheless, comparing this
value to ΔRh0′ data of other glycolytic reactions, namely, the hexokinase reaction9 (ΔRh0′ = −67.7 kJ/mol), the phosphofructokinase reaction9 (ΔRh0′ = −50.3 kJ/mol), or the aldolase reaction9 (ΔRh0′ = −60.2 kJ/mol), indicates that the order of magnitude of
standard reaction enthalpies of glycolytic reactions driven by ATP
is all highly negative.

Conclusions
The reaction equilibrium
of the 3-PGK reaction was investigated
for three temperatures 303, 313, and 323 K at pH 7. Reaction equilibrium
was measured by varying the equimolal initial substrate concentrations
of ATP and 3-PG disodium salts. The equilibrium composition ratio Kexp′ was determined using an enzyme assay that measures the ADP/ATP ratio
based on the luciferase reaction. The results obtained for Kexp′ showed a very strong dependence on the initial substrate concentration.
The reason for that was found to be the activity coefficients of the
reacting agents, which strongly deviated from one even at low concentration.
Activity coefficients were predicted with ePC-SAFT. The ePC-SAFT parameters
were taken from the literature for all components except for 3-PG,
which were fitted in this work to osmotic coefficient data. Overall
nine species were explicitly taken into account for the prediction
of the activity coefficients of the reacting agents. Combining these
values with Kexp′ allowed proposing an activity-based
equilibrium constants Ka′(T = 303.15 K)
= 945 ± 153, Ka′(T = 313.15 K) = 501
± 35, and Ka′(T = 323.15 K) = 280
± 19. These values were used to calculate the respective standard
Gibbs free energy of reaction and the enthalpy of reaction for the
temperature range considered. The results were ΔRg0′(T = 303.15
K) = −17.3 ± 0.4 kJ/mol, ΔRg0′(T = 313.15 K) = −16.2
± 0.2 kJ/mol, ΔRg0′(T = 323.15 K) = −15.2 ± 0.2 kJ/mol,
and ΔRh0′ = −49.19
± 9.4 kJ/mol. These results differ significantly from the literature
values. The main reason is that literature data does not account for
the activities of the reacting agents, while measuring a broad range
of different initial substrate concentrations and ratios. The values
determined in this work should be considered as thermodynamically
exact and are recommended in all future works that are based on the
Gibbs free energy determination of the glycolytic pathway.

Measurement of Osmotic Coefficients
Osmotic coefficients
of the system water and 3-PG disodium salt were measured to determine
pure component and binary interaction parameters necessary for ePC-SAFT.
Measurements were performed using a freezing point depression OSMOMAT
010 from Gonotec (Germany) at ambient pressure. The measurement is
based on the freezing point depression of an aqueous solution as a
function of known concentration of 3-PG disodium salt. After calibration
with aqueous sodium chloride standards provided by Gonotec, the measured
osmolality of the sample osm was related to the osmotic coefficient
ϕ (eq 13) 13  

In eq 13, ν and m characterize the amount
of ions in which 3-PG disodium salt may dissociate and the initial
molality of 3-PG disodium salt, respectively. 3-PG disodium salt was
regarded as fully dissociated. Although this might not be true for
the whole concentration range considered, this assumption was done
due to the compatibility with the modeling strategy behind ePC-SAFT.
Held and Sadowski23 showed the ability
to account for the nondissociated species, which was proven to be
very difficult and even requires at least one more fit parameter and
the ion-pairing constant. Thus, ν was set to three for 3-PG
disodium salt independent of the concentration of 3-PG disodium salt.

Additional osmotic coefficients of the system water and 3-PG disodium
salt were measured at 303 K and ambient pressure using vapor pressure
osmometry, using a vapor pressure osmometer K-7000 from Knauer (Germany).
The K-7000 measures the resistance between the two thermistors connected
via a Wheatstone bridge. First, water was dropped on the tip of both
thermistors, which were located in a water-saturated measurement cell.
After the addition of the sample on the tip of one thermistor, vapor
pressure differences between the droplets of both thermistors lead
to a measurable current ΔI. With a calibration
constant kcalib obtained from sodium chloride
solutions of known osmolality, the osmotic coefficients were calculated
with eq 14. 14  

The data
obtained were used to fit pure component ePC-SAFT parameters
of 3-PG and the temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter kij while explicitly accounting
for water, 3-PG and Na+. This is further explained in the
next section.

Estimation of ePC-SAFT Parameters
The required pure
component ePC-SAFT parameters for all components in the reaction mixture
are the segment number miseg, the segment diameter
σi, the dispersion energy parameter ui, and the association parameters
εAiBi and κAiBi for components that are able to form hydrogen
bonds (HBs). In this work, new pure component ePC-SAFT parameters
for 3-PG2– and the binary interaction parameter kij between 3-PG2– and water were determined. The parameter fit was performed based
on a Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares method)
which minimized the objective function OF shown in eq 15, in which ϕmmod and ϕmexp denote the modeled
and the experimental osmotic coefficients. 15  

As proposed for the association ePC-SAFT
parameters of ATP and ADP by Meurer et al.,12 3-PG was also regarded as a molecule forming strong HBs. This was
accounted for by the association scheme Niassoc of 5 HB donor and 5 HB acceptor sites in agreement with the molecular
structure. On the basis of the preliminary investigations within this
work, the OF (eq 14)
approached very low values by decreasing the association volume parameter
κAiBi. Thus, κAiBi was set manually to 0.0001 and
was excluded from the parameter estimation procedure. Further, 3-PG
was modeled as charged species based on the dependence of experimental
osmotic coefficients from 3-PG concentration, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The steep decrease at small 3-PG concentrations indicates
the electrolytic behavior.24,25 The permittivity of
εr = 78.45 was used for ePC-SAFT modeling as suggested
in ref (22). 3-PG was
allowed to cross-associate with water, ATP, and ADP, whereas all other
ions were not considered as associating species.26 Inorganic ions of equal charge were not allowed to interact
via cross-dispersion, while dispersion between inorganic ions of the
opposite charge sign was allowed. For organic ions, dispersion was
treated for uncharged components (self-dispersion as well as cross-dispersion
between organic ions and all other components was allowed).

The resulting 3-PG ePC-SAFT parameters are listed in Tables 6 and 7.
The parameters are reasonable compared to other biological components.
The association energy parameter and the segment number are comparably
small values. All pure component and binary interaction parameters
used in this work are listed in Tables 6 and 7.

Reaction Equilibria Measurements
Samples for the equilibrium
measurements were prepared in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The initial
reaction mixture contained equimolar concentrations of the substrates
3-PG disodium salt and ATP disodium salt. In addition, the necessary
cofactor Mg2+ was added in the form of magnesium chloride
in a twofold excess to the moles of ATP to guarantee a full saturation
of the required ATP magnesia complex (ATPMg) required for the reaction.
The pH of all samples was adjusted to 7 using sodium hydroxide. A
constant reaction temperature and mixing was ensured using a ThermoMixer
from Eppendorf at 1500 rpm and the according temperatures (303, 313,
or 323 K). The reaction time was set to 3 h to ensure that equilibrium
was reached. This was also verified by remeasuring the reaction equilibrium
composition after readding the substrate after first reaction steps.
On the basis of the findings, inactivation or denaturation of the
enzyme was excluded (results not shown here). After reaction equilibrium
was reached, the enzyme was separated from the reaction mixture using
centrifugal filter tubes from VWR with a molecular weight cutoff of
3 kDa. Centrifugation took place in a Typ 5418R Eppendorf centrifuge
for 20 min at 14 000 rpm. To ensure a constant temperature
during the separation process, the centrifuge was preheated before
the samples were inserted.

Determination of the equilibrium
composition was performed based on measuring the ADP/ATP ratio. The
procedure was adopted from Meurer et al.12 and lead to reproducible results and thus is suited for glycolytic
reactions. The determination of the ADP/ATP ratio is based on the
luciferase reaction, during which the amount of photons emitted hν is equal to the moles of ATP converted. The luciferase
reaction is shown in eq 16. 16  

The principle of the measurement
is based on measuring the decrease
of the intensity of the emitted light through the conversion of ATP.
Afterward, ADP is converted to ATP, and the initial step of the luciferase
reaction is repeated to yield the ADP/ATP ratio as described by Meurer
et al.12 in detail. Measurement of the
emitted light at 560 nm was performed in a FLUOstar Omega plate reader
provided by BMG Labtech using the ADP/ATP ratio kit purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Knowing the initial concentration of ATP, a mole balance
was used to calculate the molality of ATP, ADP, 3-PG, and 1,3-BPG,
as shown in eqs 17–20, where the
subscript,0 denotes the initial molality of the compound. 17   18   19   20  

For predictions with ePC-SAFT, molalities of the compounds were
converted to mole fractions and the measured molalities were converted
to the mole-fraction-based expression of Kexp′, as shown
in eq 21. 21
