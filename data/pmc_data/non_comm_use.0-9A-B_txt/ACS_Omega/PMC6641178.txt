In
this study, highly stable, low-temperature-processed planar
lead halide perovskite (MAPbI3–xClx) solar cells with NiOx interfaces have been developed. Our solar cells
maintain over 85% of the initial efficiency for more than 670 h, at
the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1 sun illumination (no
UV-light filtering) at 30 °C, and over 73% of the initial efficiency
for more than 1000 h, at the accelerating aging test (85 °C)
under the same MPPT condition. Storing the encapsulated devices at
85 °C in dark over 1000 h revealed no performance degradation.
The key factor for the prolonged lifetime of the devices was the sputter-deposited
polycrystalline NiOx hole transport layer
(HTL). We observed that the properties of NiOx are dependent on its composition. At a higher Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio, the conductivity of NiOx is higher, but at the expense of optical transmittance. We obtained
the highest power conversion efficiency of 15.2% at the optimized
NiOx condition. The sputtered NiOx films were used to fabricate solar cells without
annealing or any other treatments. The device stability enhanced significantly
compared to that of the devices with PEDOT:PSS HTL. We clearly demonstrated
that the illumination-induced degradation depends heavily on the nature
of the HTL in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). The sputtered
NiOx HTL can be a good candidate to solve
stability problems in the lead halide PVSCs.

Introduction
After the invention
of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite
solar cell (PVSC) with 3.81% power conversion efficiency (PCE) by
Kojima et al.,1 it has attracted much attention
because of its low cost and easy fabrication. Within a very short
period of time, PVSCs have achieved a rapid development and the PCE
exceeded 20%, comparable to those of the conventional silicon solar
cells.2,3 There have also been a growing interest
in the development of low-temperature-processed PVSCs with inverted
device structures because of their lower fabrication cost and new
solar cell applications with their light weight and flexibility. However,
it is still a great challenge to fabricate PVSCs with long lifetime
using low-temperature processes for successful commercialization.
Although the impressive high efficiency of PVSCs stands up to those
of other existing PV technologies with >20% efficiency, the rapid
degradation phenomena broadly observed for PVSCs overshadow the future
of this PV technology.4 The literature
concerning the real performance of the PVSCs in long-term operations
is still limited, and many studies on the perovskite stabilities focus
on the stored lifetime (shelf-life).5,6 As far as we
know, there have been only a few reports on the stability of the operating
conditions of PVSCs under light.7−12 The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of an interface
layer on the long-term operation of low-temperature-processed PVSCs
under real working conditions, with maximum power point tracking (MPPT)
under 1 sun (AM1.5G) illumination (no UV-light filtering) and in the
accelerated aging at 85 °C under the same MPPT condition.

One of the possible reasons for the instability of the PVSCs is
the instability and/or adverse effects of the organic hole transport
layers (HTLs),13−16 and we set out to develop an ideal HTL that has a suitable energy
level with perovskite, high optical transparency in the visible range,
and high stability and supports the fabrication of thick and high-quality
perovskite films. Because of their large band gap (∼3.6 eV),
deep valance band edge (∼5.4 eV), ease of controlling composition,
and low cost with superior thermal and chemical stabilities, NiO derivatives
were identified to achieve our goal. In fact, NiO-based HTLs have
been used for the fabrication of inverted and other type of PVSCs,
and the stability issue often became a focus in studies concerning
them (Table S1).7,14,16−36 In this study, we demonstrate inverted planar PVSCs on the basis
of the sputter-deposited polycrystalline NiOx hole transport material. We prepared compact and homogeneous NiOx films on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass
by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering, allowing us to control
the oxygen composition and thickness, with high reproducibility.20 We revealed in detail the effect of NiOx composition and thickness (from 20 to 250 nm)
on the device performance and showed that fine-tuning of the composition
(Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio) and thickness resulted in
high-performance PVSCs with over 15% efficiency and unprecedented
stability for low-temperature-processed MAPbI3–xClx devices. We also
compared the stabilities of the NiOx-based
devices and the PEDOT:PSS-based devices under continuous illumination
from a class AAA solar simulator and MPPT condition. Surprisingly,
the NiOx-based devices maintained about
73% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation
under the 85 °C accelerated aging condition, whereas the PEDOT:PSS-based
devices maintained only <20% of the initial efficiency at 30 °C
within 400 h of operation. We clearly demonstrated that the illumination-induced
degradation significantly depends on the nature of the HTL in the
inverted PVSCs. The sputtered NiOx HTL
can be a good candidate to solve stability problems in the low-temperature-processed
lead halide PVSCs.

Results and Discussion
The device
structure of our PVSC is shown in Figure 1a. This inverted structure consists of ITO-coated
glass/NiOx/perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3–xClx)/PC61BM/aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/Ag,
where the NiOx is the HTL (or electron-blocking
layer) and PC61BM/AZO is the electron transport layer.
The corresponding band diagram and energy levels are shown in Figure 1b. The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) cross section of the device is illustrated in Figure 1c. Sealing glass
was used to encapsulate the device, to protect it from moisture and
oxygen.

Properties of NiOx Thin Films
NiOx films were fabricated at different
Ar pressures of the deposition chamber; the optical and electrical
properties of the resulting NiOx films
depend on the deposition conditions, and it was found that at lower
pressure, because of Ni vacancy/excess oxygen in the films, they became
blackish (Figure S1). This observation
parallels to that of the previous study with compact NiOx electron-blocking layers prepared by sputtering.20 The oxygen content of the black form was slightly
greater than that of its green counterpart.37 The defect of NiO films is due to the interstitial oxygen or Ni2+ vacancy that occurs as a result of the creation of Ni3+ ions. For each Ni2+ vacancy (Niv),
two Ni2+ ions must be converted to Ni3+ to preserve
the overall charge neutrality in the crystal. This ensures excess
oxygen compared to the number of nickel ions in the crystal. Finally,
the creation of defects in NiOx crystals
can be expressed with the following equation  Now, if an electron moves from a Ni2+ site to a Ni3+ site, it is like the movement of a hole
in the opposite direction through the Ni2+ sites. These
holes contribute to the electrical conductivity of undoped NiOx crystals. Therefore, NiOx with excess oxygen is a p-type semiconductor.38

To analyze the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of the sputtered NiOx thin
films, they were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). As shown in Figure 2, the peak at 860.8 eV is due to the shake-up process of the
NiO structure, the peak at 853.8 eV indicates Ni2+ ion,
and the peak at 855.5 eV indicates Ni3+ ion.23 The compositions of Ni2+ and Ni3+ in the crystals were determined by calculating the integral
area of the fitting curve of the XPS spectra, and the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of NiOx films
is shown in Figure 3. It is evident from the figure that the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio decreased with increasing pressure.

the Ni 2p3/2 peak

NiOx films prepared at 0.5, 2.0, 3.5,
5.0, and 6.5 Pa Ar pressures.

Figure 3 Composition of NiOx films at different
Ar pressures.

The films prepared by
sputtering methods are polycrystalline in
nature and have cubic structure, as shown in Figure 4. At lower pressure, the (111) peak is dominating,
and with increasing pressure, (200) peak becomes dominating. Broader
X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks indicate smaller crystals of the fabricated
films. Furthermore, we studied the surface morphology of NiOx films by SEM, as shown in Figure 5. The SEM images demonstrate
small grains of NiOx films, and the grain
size is dependent on the thickness of the films. At a lower thickness
(∼20 nm), the grain size is quite small; however, with increasing
thickness (up to 250 nm), the grain size gradually increases. The
Ar pressure in the sputtering chamber has little effect on the grain
size (Figure S2), and with increasing Ar
pressure, the grain size increases. With increasing Ar pressure in
the sputtering chamber, the transmittance of the prepared films also
increases, as shown in Figure 6. The films prepared at 0.5 Pa have a lower transmittance
of 60% at the 550 nm wavelength of the visible range of the spectrum,
whereas the films prepared at or above 3.5 Pa show more than 80% transmittance
at the 550 nm wavelength of the spectrum. It is notable that the difference
of transmittance between the films prepared at 0.5 and 3.5 Pa is very
large (∼20%), whereas the effect is very little (<5%) for
the films prepared at 3.5–6.5 Pa. Because of increasing Ni
vacancy/excess oxygen, the films became blackish and their transmittance
decreased at lower Ar pressure.

Ar pressures.

Figure 6 Transmission spectra of NiOx films
on glass substrate at different Ar pressures (film thickness: 60–70
nm for 0.5–3.5 Pa and ∼40 nm for 5.0–6.5 Pa)
and at different thicknesses at an Ar pressure of 3.5 Pa.

Figure 6 also compares
the transmittances of the fabricated NiOx films at different thicknesses. It is evident from the figure that
transmittance declines with increasing thickness, as expected, and
the only exception is at the 150 nm thickness, where the transmittance
is higher than that at the 70 nm thickness. The reason may be the
large grain size, as shown in Figure 5, which might reduce the light scattering by the grain
boundary. The films prepared at 0.5 and 2.0 Pa have resistivities
of 3.28 × 102 and 2.92 × 103 Ω·cm,
respectively. However, the films prepared at the pressure range of
3.5–6.5 Pa have very high resistivities, which we could not
measure using our linear four-probe system. The low resistivity of
the films prepared at lower pressure possibly indicated the increased
Ni vacancy/excess oxygen in the crystals, which act as the hole and
contribute to the electrical conductivity. This effect is quite consistent
with the XPS and XRD results. The resistivity values of the (200)-orientated
NiOx films are higher than those of the
(111)-orientated films.39

Device Performances
We revealed the dependence of device
performances on the Ar pressure during sputter deposition of NiOx, and the results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 7. It is observed that with
increasing Ar pressure up to 3.5 Pa, the device performance enhanced
and beyond that pressure, it declined (Figure 7a). This phenomenon can be explained with
the optical and electrical properties of the sputtered NiOx thin films. As shown in Figure 6, at lower pressure, the NiOx thin films absorbed some part of the incident sunlight.
At higher pressure, although the transmittance is better, higher resistance
of the films reduces the device performance, as seen from the increased
series resistance (Rs) for 5.0 and 6.5
Pa. Therefore, we selected the devices with NiOx HTL prepared at 3.5 Pa Ar pressure for further study of
thickness-dependent device performance, and the results are summarized
in Table 2.

It was found that when the NiOx layer
was too thin (e.g., 20 nm), the devices showed lower PCE. The very
thin film may be not sufficient to block the photogenerated electrons
because of the insufficient coverage of the ITO film with the NiOx layer, which in turn decreases the FF.22,29 In fact, the improved FF values with increasing thickness were observed
possibly due to the elimination of pinholes. However, with a very
thick NiOx HTL, the FF was satisfactory,
but the PCE was again low. With higher thickness, the transmittance
decreased, with a small deviation at 150 nm thickness. From Figure 7b, we can see that
with higher thickness, the EQE of the devices decreased significantly
at lower wavelength, which reduces their short-circuit current density
(Jsc). Devices with a NiOx HTL thickness of 70 ± 3 nm showed the best
performance (Figure 8). Although the hysteresis behaviors of the PVSCs are an important
issue, which is frequently observed and reported in the literature,40 our NiOx devices
showed almost no hysteresis behaviors. The devices showed a good reproducibility
with a limited deviation of PCE, as shown in Figure 9. Histograms of solar cell efficiencies were
collected from 32 cells with NiOx HTL
of thickness 70 ± 3 nm prepared at 3.5 Pa Ar pressure.

−0.05 V; step, 0.02 V; delay time, 200 ms).

No significant performance degradation was observed for encapsulated
devices with NiOx HTL stored at ambient
temperature under dark condition for 5 months and 85 °C for 1000
h. The significant improvement of the stability over previous NiOx-based devices (Table S1) was achieved possibly due to the synergy of the NiOx HTL, with the high optoelectronic quality of the
MACl-treated perovskite layer.41 We also
observed that the PCE and open-circuit voltage (Voc) gradually increase with time at ambient temperature
and under dark condition. The improvement can be explained by the
ion migration and chemical doping of the PCBM layer by iodide.8,42 On the other hand, under continuous 1 sun illumination (no UV-light
filtering) and MPPT condition at 30 °C, the performance first
degraded gradually and then the degradation rate decreased; it eventually
reached 87% of the initial efficiency after 670 h of operation, as
shown in Figure 10a. The PEDOT:PSS-based devices degrade rapidly, and within 400 h,
they retain only <20% of the initial PCE, possibly due to the chemical
nature of the PEDOT:PSS layer.13−16 The lifetime of solar cells may be defined as the
operation time until the output of the device has fallen below a certain
level, that is, 70% of nominal efficiency for more than 40 years was
expected from some commercial Si solar cells, and it often requires
accelerated aging conditions to predict their lifetime in a reasonable
testing time. In fact, the NiOx-based
devices showed surprisingly high stability and it would require significant
testing time to observe degradation at 30 °C (Figure 10a). Thus, we decided to accelerate
the aging by increasing the testing temperature up to 85 °C (Figure 10b). The degradation
rate was indeed increased compared to that of the 30 °C testing,
and the initial 14% efficiency at room temperature reduced to about
13% because of the negative-efficiency temperature coefficient of
the perovskite devices.8 Further continuation
of the high-temperature testing induced significant efficiency drop
from 13.0% to below 9.5%, which corresponds to 73% of the initial
efficiency after 1000 h. According to the definition of the acceleration
factor, K, under the assumption of an Arrhenius model,
defined by the equation43 1  where Ea is the
activation energy for the degradation processes in electron volts
(eV), kB is the Boltzman constant, and
two testing temperatures (Thigh = 85 °C
and Tlow = 25 °C), the result of
the accelerated testing suggested that the NiOx-based devices would operate over 7000 h (K = 7) at room temperature (Tlow = 25
°C) before the output falls below 73% of the initial efficiency,
if the activation energy (Ea) for a degradation
path of these devices was 0.3 eV, which is a lower-end value estimated
for a polymer solar cell.43 In the similar
manner, the device would operate over 3000 h (K =
3) at 50 °C (Figure S3), which is
a typical working condition of a solar cell operating on the roof.
As shown in Figure S3, the predicted lifetime
based on the acceleration factor (eq 1) of the solar cells strongly relies on the activation
energy (Ea); thus, accelerated aging tests
at several different temperature conditions will be necessary for
more conclusive discussions in future stability studies.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully developed efficient and hysteresis-free
inverted planar lead halide PVSCs with improved stability and reproducibility
using NiOx HTLs. The NiOx layers were prepared by rf magnetron sputtering without
postdeposition annealing. Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio in
the NiOx film not higher than ∼3
with 70 ± 3 nm thickness showed superior quality as an HTL. The
synergy of the NiOx HTL with the high
optoelectronic quality of the MACl-treated perovskite layer41 resulted in no performance degradation at 85
°C in dark. More importantly, although it was found that these
encapsulated devices showed no degradation under dark condition at
85 °C over 1000 h, they still degraded under continuous 1 sun
illumination at 30 and 85 °C and under MPPT operation. Nevertheless,
our results demonstrated that NiOx as
HTL is a good candidate to solve stability problems in the low-temperature-processed
inverted PVSCs. Further investigation is necessary to improve the
solar cell performance under continuous illumination for commercial
applications.

Methods
NiOx Film Deposition
The
NiOx thin films were prepared on the commercially
available precleaned and prepatterned ITO-coated glass substrates
using an rf magnetron sputtering system (SVC-700 RFIINA; Sanyu Electron,
Japan). Substrates for devices and glasses for characterizing the
structural, optical, electrical, and compositional properties were
deposited in the same batch for side-by-side comparisons. All of the
substrates were treated with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min and immediately
loaded in the deposition chamber. Before deposition, the chamber was
evacuated until the pressure inside it becomes <2 × 10–3 Pa; then, pure argon gas was introduced at the rate
of 20 sccm. Sputter deposition was carried out in an argon gas pressure
of 0.5–6.5 Pa and a rf power supply of 50 W. The thickness of the
NiOx films for pressure <3.5 Pa was
about 60–70 nm and that for >5.0 Pa was about 40 nm. Commercially
available sintered 99.9% pure NiO was used as the target (Kojundo
Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd, Japan). The thicknesses of the NiOx films were controlled by regulating the deposition
time from 20 min to 2 h. All procedures were carried out in room temperature
(no intentional heating).

Materials and Characterizations
All chemicals were
purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received, unless stated
otherwise. Perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving
PbI2 (Kanto Chemical, 98% purity) in anhydrous N, N-dimethylformamide (400 mg mL–1), and methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl)
(Wako Chemicals, battery grade] in ethanol (50 mg mL–1, 19:1 ratio). PC61BM (Sigma-Aldrich, 99% purity) solution
(2 wt %) dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene was used for coating
the electron transport layer. All solutions were filtered through
0.45 μm syringe filters to avoid the risk of particle formation.
AZO nanoparticle ink (Nanograde N-21X) was used to prepare the AZO
layer. The XRD patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer
(Rigaku SmartLab, Japan) (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54050
Å). Top-surface and cross-sectional images were taken using a
high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, S-4800) at
a 5 kV accelerating voltage carefully to avoid damage to the samples.
XPS (ULVAC-PHI, VersaProbe II, Japan) was used to analyze the elemental
composition of the NiOx films. The UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded on a UV–vis NIR spectrophotometer
(Jasco V-7200). The resistivity of the films was measured by a linear
four-probe method. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (FF, Rs, and Rsh) were analyzed
by commercial software (SYSTEMHOUSE SUNRISE Corp.), and the incident
monochromatic IPCE spectra and EQE were measured using a spectrometer
(SM-250IQE; Bunko-keiki, Japan). For stability testing, the encapsulated
devices were evaluated under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5G, no UV-light
filtering) and MPPT condition using a solar simulator system equipped
with a temperature-controlled oven (BIR-50; Bunko-keiki, Japan). A
thermocouple was placed near the sample surface to monitor the testing
condition. Histograms of 32 cells with NiOx HTL (70 ± 3 nm) prepared at 3.5 Pa were deduced from the devices,
with an area of 0.19 cm2 defined by an aperture mask.

Device Fabrication
A thin layer (∼30 nm) of
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios, Al4083) was formed by spin coating at 3000 rpm
and subsequently dried at 120 °C for 15 min on a hot plate in
ambient air. Sputter-deposited NiOx and
PEDOT:PSS substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox
(<1.0 ppm of O2 and H2O), inside which the
remaining steps were performed. A PbI2 film was spin-coated
at 3000 rpm for 90 s and then a mixture of MAI and MACl was spun onto
the PbI2 layer at 4000 rpm for 90 s for Cl-mediated interdiffusion.44 Then, to promote crystallization, those as-grown
CH3NH3PbI3–xClx perovskite films were placed inside
a Petri dish with MACl powders on a hot plate at 100 °C for MACl
treatment.41 A PC61BM layer
was spun onto the perovskite layer at 700 rpm for 60 s, followed by
coating with an AZO layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were then
transferred to the rf magnetron sputtering chamber outside the glovebox
for metal contact (silver) deposition. Ag (150 nm) was sputtered at
an Ar pressure of 0.15 Pa. The devices were sealed by encapsulation
glasses and UV-curable resins (UV RESIN XNR5516Z; Nagase ChemteX,
Japan) before measurement under ambient conditions and the stability
test.
