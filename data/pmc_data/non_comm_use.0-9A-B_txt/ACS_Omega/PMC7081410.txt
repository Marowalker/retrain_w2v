To surmount incompatibility
provoked efficiency suppression of
an anisotype heterojunction and to pursue an improved intrinsic photocatalytic
activity by manipulating oriented transfer of photoinduced charge
carriers, an In2S3/BiVO4 (1:1) n–n
isotype heterojunction was fabricated successfully through a simple
two-step calcination method, followed by a wet-chemical deposition
method. The formation of an n–n isotype heterojunction was
confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV–visible diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy. The photocatalytic efficiency of the In2S3/BiVO4 catalyst was examined over degradation of
oxytetracycline hydrochloride (O-TCH) and oxygen (O2) evolution
reaction. Consequently, an n–n In2S3/BiVO4 isotype heterojunction exhibits a superior O-TCH degradation
efficiency (94.6%, 120 min) and O2 evolution (695.76 μmol,
120 min) of multiple folds as compared to the pure BiVO4 and In2S3 solely. This is attributed to the
proper band alignment and intimate interfacial interaction promoted
charge carrier separation over the n–n isotype heterojunction.
The intimate interfacial contact was confirmed by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM, and field emission scanning
electron microscopy analysis. The proper band alignment was confirmed
by Mott–Schottky analysis. The photoelectrochemical linear
sweep voltammetric study shows a superior photocurrent density (269
μA/cm2) for In2S3/BiVO4 as compared to those for pristine BiVO4 and In2S3, which is in good agreement with the photocatalytic
results. Furthermore, the superior charge antirecombination efficiency
of the n–n isotype heterojunction was established by photoluminescence,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Bode analysis, transient photocurrent,
and carrier density analysis. The improved photostability of the heterojunction
was confirmed by chronoamperometry analysis. An orderly corelationship
among physicochemical, electrochemical, and photocatalytic properties
was established, and a possible mechanistic pathway was presented
to better understand the outcome of the n–n isotype heterojunction.
This study presents an effective way to develop new n–n isotype
heterojunction-based efficient photocatalysts and could enrich wide
applications in other areas.

1 Introduction
Semiconductor-oriented
visible photon-driven heterogeneous photocatalysis
has gathered huge interest in the current era as a green sustainable
futuristic resolution to the major global tribulations such as energy
scarcity and environmental catastrophe.1−3 The generalized principle
involves light harvesting, resulting in photoinduced charge carrier
formation which ultimately promotes redox reaction over the semiconductor
surface.4−8 An assorted number of strategies are carried out to manipulate intrinsic
physicochemical and optoelectronic characteristics of semiconductors
in order to fabricate a robust photocatalyst with superior conversion
efficiency, that is, solar to chemical energy. However, the efficiency
of traditional anisotype heterojunctions developed so far between
semiconductors of different charge carrier densities is restricted
by a high recombination rate of photoinduced electron–hole
pairs because of interfacial incompatibility and low redox potential
of the respective conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge.9,10 To remove the constraint, various isotype n–n functional
heterojunctions of CN/CNS-, GCN/CCN-, BiPO4/Bi2WO6-, ZnWO4/Bi2WO6-,
Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55/Bi2MoO6-, CdS/ZnWO4-, g-C3N4/TiO2-, In2S3/g-C3N4-, and MoO3/BiVO4-like materials were fabricated.11−19 This methodology proficiently heightens the strong intimate interfacial
contact and superior compatibility between the two materials, which
further induces the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes
more effectively via providing a strong driving force by creating
a space charge accumulation/depletion region at the junction interfaces.20−22 Nevertheless, the benchmark has not yet been achieved, and the construction
of an effective n–n isotype heterojunction material is still
a big challenge for the research community.

In this context,
visible-light-responsive n-type monoclinic bismuth
vanadate (BiVO4) has attracted tremendous attention because
of its suitable band gap, that is, 2.3–2.7 eV, nontoxicity,
high stability, wide light absorbance range, and especially its weak
hole localization property, which is due to the destructive effect
of the [VO4] tetrahedron, suitable for O2 evolution.20,23−25 However, the catalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 could not reach up to the mark because of the lower photogenerated
charge carrier mobility and higher photogenerated electron–hole
pair recombination rates. Hence, to nullify this associated drawback
of BiVO4, researchers started adopting the isotype heterojunction
technique, that is, combining n-type BiVO4 with another
suitable n-type semiconductor, and interestingly, the author’s
group has reported an n–n-type M-BiVO4/T-BiVO4 heterojunction toward water oxidation and antibiotic degradation.20 Extending the search for a better match for
BiVO4, n-type β-indium sulfide (β-In2S3), a group III–VI metal sulfide with an ideal
band gap of 2.0–2.3 eV, has evolved as a potential semiconductor
photocatalyst because of its low toxicity, narrow band gap, good photostability,
good photosensitivity, and photoconductivity.18,26,27 Taking these advantageous features into
account, an In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
isotype heterojunction was designed, which could be beneficial in
enhancing the antirecombination rate of photogenerated carriers on
behalf of the high conductivity of In2S3, leading
to charge channelization and maintaining the water decomposition property
with respect to the monoclinic crystal structure of BiVO4. However, the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
isotype heterojunction-based photocatalyst for oxytetracycline hydrochloride
(O-TCH) degradation and oxygen evolution remains unavailable so far,
and the demanding association among physicochemical, photoelectrochemical,
and photocatalytic properties of the BiVO4-based n–n
isotype hybrid catalysts has not yet been investigated in detail.

Considering the aforementioned background, we herein fabricated
an n–n isotype heterojunction of M-BiVO4 and In2S3 with an equimolar ratio through a simple two-step
calcination process followed by a wet-chemical deposition method and
examined the photocatalytic activity of the so-formed photocatalyst
toward O-TCH degradation and oxygen evolution separately. The enhanced
photoinduced charge carrier antirecombination process over the n–n
isotype heterojunction interface results in higher activity and is
validated by photoluminescence (PL), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), transient photocurrent, Bode
analysis, and carrier density analysis. The intimate interfacial contact
and superior compatibility between BiVO4 and In2S3 were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) analysis. The proper band alignment of BiVO4 and In2S3 in the n–n isotype
heterojunction is established by the Mott–Schottky (MS) study.
A possible mechanistic pathway was proposed and discussed for the
n–n isotype heterojunction based on the experimental and analytical
investigations. Furthermore, the physicochemical, electrochemical,
and photocatalytic properties are correlated and discussed in depth.
This n–n isotype heterojunction-based photocatalytic system
will provide a new direction in designing double charge-transfer-oriented
catalytic composites for energy generation and organic/inorganic pollutant
degradation.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Fabrication of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n Isotype Heterojunction
Bismuth
nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99%, MERCK), ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, 99%, LOBA CHEMIE), nitric acid (HNO3, 69%, MERCK), ammonium
hydroxide (NH4OH, 28–30%, MERCK), indium chloride
(InCl3), thioacetamide (C2H5NS),
and ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.9%) of analytical grade
are used for the synthesis procedure without any further purification.
Deionized (DI·H2O) water was used throughout the experiments.
An In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype
heterojunction catalyst with an equimolar ratio of Bi and In was fabricated
using a simple two-step calcination process, followed by a wet-chemical
deposition method. In a distinctive procedure, pristine monoclinic
BiVO4 was synthesized by a coprecipitation method with
an optimized calcination temperature, a technique we previously reported,
followed by wet-chemical deposition of In2S3.20,28 The schematic representation of the synthesis
procedure of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
isotype heterojunction is given in Scheme 1. About 0.020 mole of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate
(Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) was initially
dissolved in 165 mL of 2 M HNO3. A stoichiometric quantity
of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) was added
maintaining the overall molar ratio of metal ions present in the resulting
solution to Bi/V = 1:1. A homogeneous yellow color solution was then
obtained by continuously stirring the resulting mixture for 2 h. The
final pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to 9 by the slow addition
of ammonium hydroxide under continuous stirring, leading to the formation
of a yellowish orange precipitate. The stirring was continued for
next 1 h for better product formation. The resulting precipitate was
then centrifuged, washed several times with distilled water and ethanol
to remove the unwanted product, and dried in a hot air oven for 24
h at 70 °C. Monoclinic BiVO4 was obtained by finely
grinding the dried sample, followed by a heat treatment of 600 °C
for 5 h with a 10 °C/min heating rate in a muffle furnace. The
product was then collected and grinded finely for further photocatalytic
studies. About 0.003 mole of the synthesized monoclinic BiVO4 catalyst was added to a 80 mL aqueous solution containing a certain
amount of InCl3 and C2H5NS with a
molar ratio of In/S = 2:3 and Bi/In = 1:1. The mixture was vigorously
stirred at 85 °C for 3 h, leading to a brown precipitate. The
precipitate was then centrifuged, washed several times with DI water,
and well dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C for 24 h. The sample
was collected and grinded well for further characterization. The sample
was indexed as In2S3/BiVO4. For comparison,
pristine In2S3 was obtained by the above-specified
methodology without addition of BiVO4.

In2S3/BiVO4 n–n Isotype Heterojunction
2.2 Analytical Characterizations
Powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were investigated using a Rigaku
Ultima IV diffractometer with a monochromatic Cu Kα X-ray radiation
source (λ = 1.5 Å) in a scan range of 2θ = 10–80°
and with a 5° min–1 scan rate. The applied
voltage and current were well maintained at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively.
The structures and surface morphologies were neatly studied by conducting
TEM analysis on a Philips Tecnai G2 instrument (200 kV) and FESEM
analysis on Zeiss Supra 55, respectively. The surface chemical composition
was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in an ESCA+
spectrometer (monochromatized Al Kα, 1486.7 eV) adopting the
C1 peak at 284.9 eV for binding energy (BE) correction. UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) was performed
by a JASCO 750 UV/visible spectrophotometer with a BaSO4 pallet as the reference. A JASCO spectrofluorometer FP8300 was used
to record the powder PL spectrum at an excitation wavelength of 325
nm. A JASCO FT/IR-4600 spectrometer was used to record the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum using the potassium bromide (KBr)
matrix. All measurements were performed at room temperature unless
particularly specified.

2.3 Electrochemical Measurements
Photoelectrochemical
measurement was performed on an IVIUM-n-STAT electrochemical workstation
using a conventional three-electrode pyrex electrochemical cell consisting
of a prepared electrode as the working electrode, a platinum (Pt)
wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode
in an electrolytic solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH
= 6.1). The electrophoretic deposition method was introduced to fabricate
the working electrodes. About 20 mg of the prepared photocatalyst
powder with 20 mg of iodine was well dispersed in 20 mL of acetone.
Two fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes arranged in a parallel
manner and separated by 10–15 mm were placed in the catalyst-suspended
solution. A 60 V bias was applied under potentiostatic control between
the two FTOs for 5 min, maintaining the coating surface area to 1
cm × 1 cm. LSV study and EIS measurements were executed under
visible light irradiation. EIS studies were analyzed over a frequency
range of 0.1–10,000 Hz with 1 V amplitude at zero bias. Transient
photocurrent intensity was carried out for a time interval of 300
s at 0.6 V applied potential under the illumination of chopped visible
light. Chronoamperometry (CA) study was carried out for a time interval
of 600 s at 0.6 V applied potential under continuous illumination
of visible light. MS analysis was carried out in the dark at an applied
frequency of 500 Hz with a 25 mV applied potential. All the visible
light irradiated measurements were conducted using a 300 W xenon lamp
with a cutoff filter of λ ≥ 400. It was noted that no
photo response was observed with a cleaned FTO without catalyst coating.

2.4 Photocatalytic O-TCH Degradation
Photocatalytic
degradation of oxytetracycline aqueous solution was
cautiously accomplished in a quartz photocatalytic reactor under visible
light illumination (300 W Xe lamp, λ ≥ 420 nm, 100 mW/cm2). Initially, 20 mg of the prepared catalyst was homogeneously
dispersed in a 20 mL solution (aq) of O-TCH of concentration 20 mg
L–1. The resulting suspension was stirred for 30
min magnetically in the dark to accomplish the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. The resulting suspension was then illuminated with visible
light for 120 min under magnetic stirring. Eventually, the resulting
suspension was centrifuged and analyzed using a UV–vis spectrometer
at 275 nm.29,30 The process was repeated with
different irradiation times to elucidate the rate of the degradation
reaction instead of periodically collecting the solution with a syringe
to avoid error.

2.5 Photocatalytic Water Oxidation
Reaction
Initially, 20 mg of the as-synthesized photocatalyst
was suspended
in a 20 mL aqueous solution of 0.05 M AgNO3 under continuous
magnetic stirring until the mixture attains homogeneity, followed
by N2 purging for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen.
Photocatalytic water oxidation reaction was achieved under visible
light illumination (300 W Xe lamp, λ ≥ 420 nm) in a sealed
quartz batch reactor of 100 mL capacity. The Xe light source was maintained
at a distance of 10 cm apart from the top of the suspension. The temperature
of the aqueous bulk suspension was maintained at room temperature
by cold water circulation. The evolved O2 was collected
via the downward water displacement technique and characterized via
a molecular sieve column gas chromatography instrument (5 Å)
with a thermal conductivity detector.

3 Results
and Discussion
The scrupulous fabrication technique of the
In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction
with superior
interfacial contact is represented in Scheme 1.

Details of the crystallographic structures
of as-synthesized photocatalysts
were initially inspected by the XRD technique, and the obtained results
are shown in Figure 1. In brief, all the featuring diffraction peaks of pristine BiVO4 and In2S3 were well indexed with a
monoclinic phase (JCPDS CARD no. 01-083-1698) and a β phase
(JCPDS CARD no. 00-032-0456), respectively. Further, the XRD patterns
of the heterojunction with an equimolar ratio of BiVO4 and
In2S3 show maximum characteristic diffraction
peaks of the combination of both the entities, suggesting a good integration
of BiVO4 and In2S3 in the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction.
Additionally, the crystallite sizes of the as-synthesized samples
were estimated by taking the full width at half-maximum value of the
most intense peak, that is, (112) for BiVO4 and (440) for
In2S3, respectively, and then by adopting Scherrer’s eq 1(31) 1  Here, D denotes the crystallite
size of the sample, λ denotes the irradiation wavelength, k denotes a constant (0.94), β denotes the half-maxima
peak width, and θ denotes the diffraction angle of the peak
under examination. The crystallite sizes of pristine monoclinic BiVO4 and In2S3 were estimated to be 38.87
and 18.18 nm, respectively. Nevertheless, the crystallite size of
both BiVO4 and In2S3 decreased after
the formation of a heterojunction to 37.8 and 14.73 nm, respectively,
elucidating a synergistic interaction between the two materials in
the formed heterojunction. Moving to the neat material, diffraction
peaks of the pristine BiVO4 sample (Figure 1a) are distinguishably intense and sharp,
indicating its highly crystalline character, while the diffractogram
of the In2S3 sample is broad and weak, which
is due to the small crystal size or the semicrystalline nature of
the catalyst. Moreover, well-distinguishable sharp diffraction peaks
of BiVO4 nanocrystals were observed in the In2S3/BiVO4 composite, establishing the highly
crystalline character of BiVO4 nanocrystals in the heterojunction.32 The intensities of the major diffraction peaks
of BiVO4 (112) and In2S3 (440) were
reduced and revealed to be shifted toward a higher diffraction angle
after the formation of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction composite with a shifting value
of 0.1° relative to their pristine phases, suggesting an intimate
contact between BiVO4 and In2S3.
The details are presented in Figure 1a,b.

Figure 1 (a) PXRD patterns, enlarged view of peak shifting of (b)
BiVO4 (112) and (c) In2S3 (440) diffraction
peaks, and (d) FTIR spectra of the fabricated samples.

The bond vibrational chemistry of the In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction and both parent materials,
that
is, In2S3 and BiVO4, was established
by FTIR analysis. The typical FTIR spectra of BiVO4 (Figure 1d) show broad absorptions
(within 1000–500 cm–1) associated with ν3
asymmetric stretching vibration of the VO4 unit. In brief,
the peak representing ν3 (VO4) is centered around
740 cm–1, whereas ν1 depicting symmetric stretching
vibration of the VO4 unit ν1 (VO4) is
positioned at 840 cm–1, which corresponds to the
monoclinic phase of BiVO4.33−35 The FTIR absorption
bands of the unadulterated In2S3 catalyst indicate
the typical molecular structure of In2S3. The
strong absorption bands at 3450 and 1621 cm–1 in
the coprecipitated In2S3 sample were attributed
to the bonding frequency of the adsorbed hydroxyl (−OH) groups.
Furthermore, the occurrence of a weak IR signal at 1120 cm–1 was ascribed to the ν(S–O) vibrational frequency in
SO42–. Further, the vibrational band
centered at 1033 cm–1 was attributed to the (S–O)
stretching frequency.34 Again, for the
In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction, appearance
of absorption peaks of ν3 (VO4), ν1 (VO4), ν(S–O), and −OH bonding vibrations
with relative decreased intensity indicates the coexistence of BiVO4 and In2S3 in the composites. This was
further established by XPS analysis.

The surface chemical composition,
oxidation states, and confirmation
of double charge-transfer dynamics in the fabricated In2S3/BiVO4 nanocomposite were investigated by
XPS analysis. The corresponding survey spectrum shown in Figure 2a indicates the existence
of Bi, V, O, In, and S elements in the prepared sample devoid of any
contaminants. The appearance of the prominent carbon peak at 284.9
eV was attributed to the adventitious hydrocarbon of the XPS instrument.36 The deconvoluted narrow scan XPS spectra of
Bi displayed in Figure 2b represent three distinct peaks centered at 258.8, 161.9, and 163.8
eV. The foremost and hindmost peak with a peak difference of 5 eV
attributed to the spin−orbit separation of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 doublets indicate the +3 state of the Bi
atom.20,37 The ternary peak appearing along with the
peaks of Bi centered at 161.9 eV corresponds to the 2p state of sulfur.38 This further corroborates proper incorporation
of In2S3 with BiVO4 in the heterojunction.
The corresponding characteristic peaks centered at 516.5 and 523.8
eV are attributed to V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 states
of V (Figure 2c). A
peak separation of 7.3 eV indicates the existence of V in the +5 valence
state.20,37 O 1s symmetric spectra displayed two distinct
deconvoluted peaks centered at 529.5 and 532 eV (Figure 2d). The former one corresponds
to the lattice oxygen of the Bi–O and V–O bond, whereas
the latter one is ascribed to the hydroxyl (−OH) group present
in the sample. As shown in Figure 2e, two high-resolution In 3d peaks were found at a
lower BE value of 444.9 eV (In 3d5/2) and a higher BE value
of 452.5 eV (In 3d3/2). The peak difference of 7.6 eV indicates
the +3 state of indium.38 As displayed
in Figure 2, the respective
BE values of Bi, V, and O in the n–n isotype heterojunction
suffered a negative shift as compared to the corresponding values
of unadulterated BiVO4, indicating the flow of electrons
from In2S3 to BiVO4.12,39 Furthermore, shifting in BE confirms the occurrence of strapping
interaction between BiVO4 and In2S3, exhibiting a higher photocatalytic activity.20 Consequently, the intensity ratio of Bi/In < 1 indicates
distribution of In2S3 nanoparticles over BiVO4 microcrystals.32 This is further
confirmed by UV, TEM, and FESEM analysis.

narrow scan XPS of (b) Bi 4f and S 2p,
(c) V 2p, (d) O 1s, and (e) In 3d spectra of In2S3/BiVO4 compared to the corresponding spectra of pristine
BiVO4.

Moreover, the UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis
DRS) was taken into account to study the optical response of all the
as-synthesized nanocatalysts that have a vital function in the photocatalytic
performance.12 It was observed that all
the fabricated samples show light absorbance in the visible regions,
that is, pristine monoclinic BiVO4 and In2S3 exhibit absorption edges at nearly 552 and 620 nm, respectively
(Figure 3a), whereas
the nanocomposite depicts a wide absorbance extending up to the IR
region.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis DRS absorption plot and (b) Tauc plot of the
fabricated samples.

Further, two prominent
absorption bands were observed for the In2S3/BiVO4 hybrid (Figure 3a), viz., (i) the lower intense one is assigned
to the absorption of BiVO4 microcrystals and (ii) the higher
intense one is attributed to the characteristic absorption of In2S3 nanocrystals, which indicates that most of the
surface of BiVO4 microcrystals is covered by In2S3 nanocrystals.32 Accompanied
by the introduction of In2S3, the obtained In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction
composite exhibits a red shift in the absorption edge (726.28 nm)
showing a superior visible light response. The well-detectable red
shift of the optical absorption edge is also reflected in the color
change of BiVO4 (1) to yellow and that of In2S3/BiVO4 (3) to reddish brown (Figure 3a, inset) and the smaller band
gap energy as compared to pristine BiVO4 (Figure 3b). Moreover, the optical band
gap energy of the fabricated samples was approximated adopting eq 2(40) 2  where
α symbolizes the absorption coefficient, h symbolizes
Planck’s constant, A represents a constant,
ν symbolizes the light frequency, Eg represents the band gap energy, and n = 1 and 4
represent direct and indirect band gaps, respectively.41 As represented in Figure 3b, the approximated band gap energies of
pure BiVO4 (direct), In2S3 (direct),
and BiVO4/In2S3 are 2.36, 2.22, and
1.91 eV, respectively.35,42 Interestingly, the band gap of
isotype heterojunctions is located below parent combining materials
(BiVO4 and In2S3), which further
indicates the proper coupling of electronic structures of BiVO4 and In2S3 in the n–n isotype
heterojunction. This further indicates that the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction can show
an enhanced photocatalytic performance via producing more photogenerated
charge pairs under visible light illumination.40

The surface morphology of BiVO4, In2S3, and In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunctions
was studied by FESEM analysis to better justify the effect of the
morphology toward activity. Low-magnification typical FESEM images
of BiVO4 (Figures 4 and 5) show an Annona
reticulate-shaped morphology with smaller polyhedron-shaped
particles contributing to a larger irregular microsphere.20,43 The irregular microcrystals have a size in the range of 3.5–9.5
μm, as observed in Figure 4a,b. The appeared tiny pores on the crystal surface
are ascribed to the removal of gas during the calcination process.20,44

Figure 5 (a,b)
Corresponding low- and high-magnification FESEM images, (c)

In2S3/BiVO4.

Additionally, the low-resolution FESEM images of In2S3 (Figure 4c)
show agglomerated rice-shaped nanoparticles with a particle size
ranging in between 120 and 300 nm. Again, the magnified FESEM image
of In2S3 gives a closer view where ahierarchically
assembled copious two-dimensional nanorice geometry of irregular length
is clearly seen in Figure 4d. Further, the-low resolution FESEM analysis of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n heterojunction shows
irregular distribution of In2S3 rice-structured
particles over larger microspheres of BiVO4 (Figure 5a). This further indicates
the UV–vis analysis results.

Moreover, the high-resolution
FESEM image (Figure 5b) depicts the zoomed view where deposition
of two-dimensional irregular rice-shaped In2S3 over BiVO4 surface is more crystal clear and corroborates
the intimate interfacial contact of BiVO4 and In2S3, which is complementary for faster interfacial charge
transfer and better activity.20 The energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) patterns in Figure 5c highlight the existence of Bi, V, O, In,
and S in the heterojunction with a stoichiometric proportion of Bi/V
= 1.01:1 and In/S = 0.64:1. The result further confirmed by XPS analysis
is described in the respective section.

The microstructure,
interior morphology, and heterojunction interface
of BiVO4, In2S3, and In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunctions
were further studied by TEM and HRTEM investigations (Figures 6 and 7). The low-magnified TEM images of BiVO4 illustrate a
microspherical morphology with a particle size range of 3.5–9.5
μm (Figure 6a).
The findings are well concordant with the FESEM analysis. An interlayer d-spacing value of 0.308 nm was observed from the HRTEM
image of monoclinic BiVO4 and is attributed to the (112)
crystal plane (Figure 6b). The characteristic low-resolution TEM images of In2S3 (Figure 6a) illustrate an aggregation of irregular rice-shaped nanoparticles
with a particle size range of 200–300 nm. Further, the HRTEM
results depict an interlayer lattice spacing of 0.324 nm that is attributed
to the (311) plane of In2S3 (Figure 6b).

and HRTEM images of BiVO4 and
(c,d) corresponding TEM and HRTEM images of In2S3.

Figure 7 (a,b) Corresponding TEM and HRTEM images and
(c) SAED patterns
of In2S3/BiVO4.

The typical TEM images of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n heterojunction sample show distribution of irregular
nanoparticles of In2S3 over the circumference
of spherical nanoparticles of BiVO4 (Figure 7a). The result is in good agreement with
FESEM analysis. Moreover, the HRTEM images of In2S3/BiVO4 depict two diverse d-spacing
values of 0.308 and 0.324 nm, which are ascribed to the (112) and
(311) planes of BiVO4 and In2S3,
respectively (Figure 7b). A precise contact between the lattice fringes of In2S3 and BiVO4 in the heterojunction as represented
in Figure 7c confirms
an intimate interfacial contact and superior compatibility between
the two combining semiconductors. The intense circular rings of the
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern are in good consistency
with the (112) and (531) planes of BiVO4 and In2S3, respectively, and further establish a configuration
of an intimate contact. Moreover, the intense circular rings illustrate
the polycrystalline nature of the combining materials. Consequently,
deposition of the smaller In2S3 particle will
facilitate the charge transfer to the surface attributable to the
faster mean free paths of the photogenerated carriers compared to
the smaller sizes of the particles.26

We performed degradation of O-TCH aqueous solution, a representative
of organic noxious waste, to assess the photocatalytic efficiency
of In2S3/BiVO4 samples in comparison
to that of pristine BiVO4 and In2S3 under visible light irradiation. Commercial Degussa P25 was used
for a comparative efficiency study of In2S3/BiVO4. Degradation of O-TCH was found to be negligible and minimal
without any catalyst and in the presence of P25 (Figure 8a). The In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction was found
to accomplish about 94.6% of O-TCH degradation in 120 min, achieving
1.79- and 1.36-fold efficiencies than that of pristine BiVO4 (52.7%) and In2S3 (69.5%), respectively. A
pseudo-first-order kinetic model was used to obtain the tentative
results to better understand the reaction kinetics (Figure 8b,c). Following the degradation
efficiencies, the rate constant of the In2S3/BiVO4 (0.0243 min–1) n–n isotype
heterojunction was found to be 5 and 7 times higher than that of pristine
BiVO4 (0.0062 min–1) and In2S3 (0.0098 min–1), respectively (Figure 8d). An elevated photocatalytic
efficiency of In2S3/BiVO4 can be
ascribed to the superior interfacial compatibility between BiVO4 and In2S3 in the formed n–n
isotype heterojunction, resulting in effective exciton separation
and better availability of electron–hole pairs to carry out
the degradation process.

(b) UV–vis
DRS absorption spectra over degradation time, (c) time variation study,
and (d) pseudo-first-order kinetics for the degradation of O-TCH of
the prepared samples compared to that of P25.

Furthermore, the photocatalytic reusability study suggests the
higher stability of the In2S3/BiVO4 catalyst (Figure 9a). A negligible decay (1.82%) in degradation efficiency after the
fourth cycle is attributed to the inescapable loss of the In2S3/BiVO4 catalyst throughout the periodic recuperation
process performed after each cycle and also because of wear and tear
of the catalyst surface. PXRD analysis of the sample after the fifth
cycle shows a well-preserved crystal structure with a negligible decrease
in intensity (Figure 9b), which further establishes the superior stability of the isotype
hybrid.

patterns of In2S3/BiVO4 after the
cyclic degradation study, (c) active species detection test for In2S3/BiVO4 toward photocatalytic O-TCH
degradation, and (d) NBT test for all the fabricated samples.

Extending the research further, involvements of
possible active
radicals in the photocatalytic degradation reaction were investigated
by introducing various trapping agents. In detail, p-benzoquinone (p-BQ), methanol (MEOH), isopropanol
(IPA), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were, respectively, used as •O2–, h+, •OH, and e– scavengers.20,45 A superoxide radical was found to be an active suppressing agent
for the degradation process with a decrease in degradation efficiency
from 94.6% without the trapping agent to 24% with p-BQ (Figure 9c). A
drastic decrease in UV–vis absorption intensity shows an obvious
superior transformation of nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) by
the excess •O2– produced
(Figure 9d).46 Furthermore, introduction of MEOH, IPA, and
DMSO leads to a decrease in degradation efficiency, that is, 57, 76,
and 37%, respectively, confirming the involvement of •O2–, e–, and h+ as active species instead of •OH in the
visible-light-promoted O-TCH degradation over the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction. This
is in agreement with the electronic band structures of BiVO4 and In2S3 as confirmed by the MS plots.12

Moreover, the photocatalytic water oxidation
efficiency of the
n–n isotype heterojunction was premediated by oxygen evolution
reaction in the presence of the sacrificial reagent AgNO3.20,47 Perceptibly, the In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction shows a higher rate of oxygen evolution
(695.7 μmol) as compared to pristine BiVO4 (436.4
μmol) and In2S3 (312.2 μmol) in
120 min of visible light irradiation (Figure 10a). The recyclability investigation was
also carried out to ascertain better stability of the heterojunction
toward oxygen evolution reaction. As shown in Figure 10b, the heterojunction exhibits significant
steadiness up to four consecutive cycles (such as C1, C2, C3, and
C4) with minor alterations in the O2 generation rate. The
insignificant interlude after the third cycle was ascribed to the
formation of a metallic silver cluster because of Ag+ photoreduction
on the surface of the catalyst that interrupts the visible light penetration.27,48

fabricated catalysts and (b) recyclability test for In2S3/BiVO4 toward photocatalytic O2 evolution.

To reveal the mechanistic pathway
of initiation, separation, transfer,
and recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers, the PL study
of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype
heterojunction was carried out carefully in comparison to those of
pristine BiVO4 and In2S3 (λex = 325, rt). An elevated PL intensity suggests an elevated
recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers, resulting
in lower photocatalytic efficiency and vice versa.11,20 As shown in Figure 11a, the pure BiVO4 shows a broad absorption peak centered
at 538 nm corresponding to the band gap emission.11 In contrast, a negligible emission intensity of the fractional
value compared to that of pristine BiVO4 and In2S3 was shown by In2S3/BiVO4 at an identical spectrometric circumstance signifying an obvious
decline in the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge pairs
in the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype
heterojunction. The PL quenching was perceptibly ascribed to prior
injection of the photoexcited electrons from In2S3 to BiVO4, resulting in an enhancement in the spatial
charge separation and the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers.
The finding was further established by the photoelectrochemical measurements.

Figure 11 (a)
PL, (b) EIS, (c) Bode, and (d) transient photocurrent study
for all the fabricated samples.

In order to explore more about the migration and separation of
the photogenerated charge carriers, the fabricated samples were investigated
by implementing the EIS study under the zero applied potential. As
presented in Figure 11b, the Nyquist impedance (EIS) spectra of all the fabricated samples
represent characteristic plots of the single semicircular nature.
This further corroborates the occurrence of charge-transfer processes
in the prepared samples and more importantly indicates that the transfer
process is effectual in the designed n–n isotype composite.20 The semicircular arc with higher frequency is
attributable to the deterrent charge-transfer progression, while a
smaller arc radius of the material in EIS spectra represents the lower
interfacial charge-transfer resistance (RICT) value, thus indicating a faster charge-transfer mechanism and vice
versa.46,49 As shown in the impedance plot, the semicircular
Nyquist plot of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
isotype heterojunction shows a noticeably diminished arc diameter
as compared to those of the pure BiVO4 and In2S3 samples under visible light illumination. This authenticates
the strong interaction between BiVO4 and In2S3 in the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction, which facilitates the charge-transfer
process via the internal electric field, thus significantly enhancing
the antirecombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers and
substantially increasing the conductivity and photocurrent density.50 An analogous Randle circuit model was created
by fitting the obtained EIS plot to quantify the impedance results
(Figure 11b, inset).
Here, (i) RS represents the solution resistance,
(ii) RICT1 and RICT2 represent electrode–electrolyte and the In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction interface charge-transfer
resistance, respectively, and (iii) QCPE1 and QCPE2 represent constant phase elements
of the electrode–electrolyte interface and the In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction interface, respectively.20

In detail, the measured RICT1 values
of the fitted Nyquist curves of BiVO4, In2S3, and In2S3/BiVO4 were found
to be 11,540, 2085, and 2071 Ω cm–2, respectively.
A drastic decrease in RICT1 value confirms
the significant improvement in the charge-transfer process in the
electrodeelectrolyte interface after formation of an In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction.
Further, the measured RICT2 values of
BiVO4, In2S3, and In2S3/BiVO4 were found to be 1116, 2603, and 872 Ω
cm–2, respectively. The drastic decrease in the
charge-transfer resistance value of the In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction interface justifies a drastic improvement
in the interfacial charge-transfer process. This favors faster reaction
kinetics and enhanced photocatalytic activity, which defines that
architecting a vertical In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction leads to an increase in the interface
to volume ratio as compared to individual BiVO4 and In2S3, significantly improving the charge transfer
from bulk to the catalyst surface and improving the charge antirecombination
process, leading to a longer electron lifetime.51

This was further established by electrochemical Bode
phase analysis
of the catalysts (Figure 11c). The characteristic Bode frequency peak of In2S3/BiVO4 underwent a negative shift toward
the lower frequency value as compared to the pristine BiVO4 and In2S3 catalyst. This concludes that the
relatively fast charge-transfer process leads to an enhanced injected
electron lifetime in the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction as the Bode frequency (f) is inversely proportional to the electron lifetime.20 Further, the injected electron lifetime was
quantitatively elucidated by eq 3(46) 3  where τe represents the injected
electron lifetime and fmax is the frequency
of the Bode peak in agreement with the lowermost frequency value.
The Bode phase of In2S3/BiVO4 was
found to give an electron lifetime of 0.44 ms, which is about 1.76
and 1.46 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 (0.25
ms) and In2S3 (0.3 ms), respectively. The result
shows that the architected In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction boosts the fast charge-transfer
process because of the synergistic effect of the n–n junction,
thus enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency.

Generation and
separation dynamics of the charge carrier in the
interface of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
junction was revealed by evaluating the transient current intensity
under the illumination of chopped light. The resultant photocurrent–time
(I–t) curves (Figure 11d) show a relatively higher
transient intensity of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n heterojunction compared to those of the bare pristine
BiVO4 and In2S3 for each light on–off
cycle. This signifies that the construction of an In2S3/BiVO4 n–n heterojunction drastically enhances
the surface charge antirecombination process, which is in accordance
with the EIS and PL study.52,53

Furthermore,
to better validate the aforementioned merits about
enhanced charge migration upon the introduction of In2S3 to form an n–n isotype heterojunction, MS plots were
elaborated to estimate charge carrier densities of the catalysts,
as the carrier density of a catalyst electrode has an inverse relationship
with the slope of the linear part of the MS plots.54 Evidently, the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction showing a relatively smaller slope
exhibits a higher carrier density as compared to pristine BiVO4 and In2S3 solely (Figure 12a,b). Quantitative evaluation
of the charge carrier densities (Nd) of
the electrode materials can be made by eq 4(55) 4  where
“e” symbolizes
the electronic charge unit (1.602 × 10–19 C),
“ε” symbolizes the dielectric constant of the
electrode material, “ε0” symbolizes
the permittivity of vacuum (8.85 × 10–12 F
m–1), “C” symbolizes
the capacitance, and “V” symbolizes
the applied electrode potential. Moreover, the increased charge carrier
density will result in an increase in electrical conductivity (σ)
of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype
heterojunction proving eq 5(56) 5  where “e” symbolizes
the electronic charge unit (1.602 × 10–19 C),
“n” symbolizes charge carrier’s
concentration, and “μ” symbolizes the charge carrier
mobility. The increased conductivity greatly favors in improving the
charge transport and separation processes, thus increasing the photocurrent
density. This is in accordance with the LSV study.56

Figure 12 Carrier density comparison study of In2S3/BiVO4 with (a) BiVO4 and (b) In2S3.

The photoelectrochemical
outcomes show the higher photocurrent
density of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
heterojunction reflected on the characteristic linear sweep voltammograms
(Figure 13a,b). The
variation of photocurrent (I) with change in applied
potential (V) was observed both in the dark and under
visible light irradiation. No noticeable current was observed in the
dark; conversely, under light illumination, the gradually increasing
photocurrent was visualized for all the three nanocatalysts ascribed
to the generation and separation of charge carriers over the semiconductor
when the electrode materials absorb light energy beyond the band gap
energy value.15 An initiation of photocurrents
at −0.49, −0.59, and −0.42 V for BiVO4, In2S3, and In2S3/BiVO4, respectively, and the persistent increasing nature with
increased applied potential attest the fact that charge separation
occurs in all the three catalysts under visible light irradiation;
however, the saturation level is significantly lower in the n–n
heterojunction compared to that in the pristine phases. Promoted by
interfacial fast charge transfer, the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction showed a higher photocurrent
density of 269 μA/cm2 at a potential of +1 V under
visible light illumination, which is about 2.27 and 1.65 times higher
than those of the pure BiVO4 (119 μA/cm2) and In2S3 (164 μA/cm2),
respectively. This further shows the higher efficiency of the n–n
isotype heterojunction toward O-TCH degradation and water oxidation
reaction under the illumination of visible light.

Figure 13 (a,b) Corresponding
LSV in the dark and under light irradiation
and (c) CA analysis for all the fabricated samples.

Additionally, the photocurrent durability of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction
catalyst was observed by the CA study (Figure 13c). The characteristic I–t plot obtained for In2S3/BiVO4 shows better stability in photocurrent generation.
Quantitatively, the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n
isotype heterojunction shows a photocurrent of 13.16 μA, initially
followed by a decay of 23%, that is, 10.7 μA for few seconds
and remained constant for 600 s. Conversely, the pristine BiVO4 underwent a decay of 36% from 9.7 to 7.15 μA, and in
In2S3, the current value reduces to 32% from
11.62 to 8.81 μA for few seconds and then remained constant
for 600 s. The result shows that the higher photoelectrochemical activity
of the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype
heterojunction is attributable to the lower charge-transfer resistance
value and higher electron lifetime. This is ascribed to the intimate
interfacial contact between the n–n isotype junctions, leading
to efficient charge transfer. This indicates a superior stability
of n–n isotype heterojunctions toward the photocatalytic process
contributable to the effectual alteration of the texture, optical,
electronic, and photoelectrochemical properties of unadulterated materials
in the heterojunction.20,50

In addition, band-edge
potentials of pristine BiVO4 and
In2S3 were calculated by MS analysis to evaluate
the probable band configuration in the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction. Positive slopes
in the MS plot (Figure 14a,b) confirm the n-type characteristics of both BiVO4 and In2S3.20,26 By extrapolating
the space charge capacitance (C–2) value to 0, the flat band potential (Efb) values are calculated to be −0.69 and −1.33 V versus
Ag/AgCl for BiVO4 and In2S3, respectively.
As the flat band potential of the n-type material gives the approximate
values of the CB position, the CB values are calculated to be −0.12
and −0.77 eV at the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) for BiVO4 and In2S3, respectively.57 Considering this, the VB positions of BiVO4 and In2S3 are calculated by eq 6(58) 6  where ECB, EVB,and Eg represent
the CB position, VB position, and band gap value (obtained from UV–vis
DRS analysis), respectively. Consequently, the VB positions of BiVO4 and In2S3 are found to be 2.24 and
1.45 eV at NHE, respectively. It is a fact that the authentic band
gap configuration of BiVO4 and In2S3 in the In2S3/BiVO4 n–n hybrid
will diverge from the above-mentioned assumption. Despite that, the
intimate interfacial contact and different flat band potentials of
BiVO4 and In2S3 in In2S3/BiVO4 can lead to the formation of a built-in
electric field in the heterojunction interface, favoring a rapid migration
and superior separation of the photoinduced charge carriers.59

Figure 14 MS plots of (a) BiVO4 and (b) In2S3.

In general, the Fermi
level of the n-type semiconductor is closer
to the CB minimum and nearly 0.2 eV lower than the bottom potential.52,57,60 Considering the above-mentioned
data, a schematic diagram of the band configuration is presented in Scheme 2, and a probable
mechanistic pathway was projected to better explain the (i) transportation
and separation of charge carriers, (ii) photocatalytic degradation
of O-TCH, and (iii) photocatalytic water oxidation reaction over the
In2S3/BiVO4 n–n isotype heterojunction
interface under visible light illumination. In the dark, with a Fermi
level at more negative potential, electrons will be injected from
the CB of In2S3 to the CB of BiVO4 until equilibrium is reached (equalized Fermi level EF1 = EF2 = EF*). This transfer process causes the formation of a depletion
layer (positive region) and accumulation layer (negative region) on
In2S3 and BiVO4, respectively. Such
a phenomenon promotes the development of a built-in electric field
around the junction area with the field directed from In2S3 to BiVO4 (Scheme 2b). Under visible light irradiation, the
built-in field promotes the electron flow from BiVO4 toward
In2S3; however, because of the higher negative
potential of the CB of In2S3, the migration
of electrons is restricted and under the same conditions photoelectrons
start moving to the CB of BiVO4 from In2S3, causing the accumulation of more photoexcited electrons
over the n–n isotype heterojunction interface.16,61,62 Further, the photoexcited electrons
over the CB interface of In2S3/BiVO4 being at a more negative reduction potential than O2/•O2– (−0.046 eV)
reduce the dissolved O2 in the aqueous solution to highly
active •O2– species.63 Furthermore, the uninterrupted photoinduced
holes in the VB of BiVO4 (+2.24 eV) rapidly migrates to
the VB of In2S3. Considering the trapping experimentation
and preceding reports, the active species responsible for O-TCH degradation
are found to be •O2– and h+, which is similar to our case.64 Thus, a large number of active holes directly participate
in the degradation process of O-TCH.45,63 In conclusion,
the n–n isotype heterojunction between BiVO4 and
In2S3 facilitates the charge transfer and enhances
the photogenerated electron–hole antirecombination process,
which exhibits improved photocatalytic activity of the In2S3/BiVO4 catalyst. The mechanistic pathway
is summarized as follows 7   8   9   10   11   12

Incorporating the results of the water oxidation
reaction over
the heterojunction, an apposite mechanistic pathway is presented in Scheme 2c. The accumulated
photoelectrons (e–) on the CB of BiVO4 having a more negative reduction potential (Ag+/Ag0 = +0.779 eV vs NHE) reduce Ag+ into its metallic
state (Ag0) on the In2S3/BiVO4 heterojunction interface.65 Conversely,
the accumulated holes (h+) on the VB of In2S3 having a more positive oxidative potential (H2O/O2 = +1.23 eV vs NHE) react with H2O to generate
O2 gas.66 The detailed mechanistic
steps are shown as follows 7   8   13   14   15  

4 Conclusions
An n–n isotype heterojunction of the In2S3/BiVO4 hybrid with superior photocatalytic efficiency
was fabricated through a simple two-step calcination process, followed
by a wet-chemical deposition technique. This process causes In2S3 to form an intimate interfacial contact with
BiVO4. The resultant heterojunction produced an enhanced
photocatalytic activity and photostability toward O-TCH degradation
and water oxidation reaction, compared to pristine components under
visible light illumination. The high photocatalytic activity of the
n–n isotype heterojunction was attributable to the simultaneous
effect of a superior intimate interfacial contact between the two
components and a superior visible light absorption ability of the
sample, leading to an increased effectual separation and migration
of photoexcitons. Thus, the formation of an n–n isotype heterojunction
through the coupling of In2S3 with BiVO4 interprets a superlative opportunity to develop a proficient
photocatalyst for energy and environmental remediation.
