In this work, we
investigate plasmonic enhancement in poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric
acid methyl ester organic photovoltaics (OPVs) by integrating shape-
and size-controlled bimetallic gold core–silver shell nanocrystals
(Au–Ag NCs) into the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate hole-transport layer. We observed that the best-performing
Au–Ag NC-incorporated OPVs improved the power conversion efficiency
by 9% via a broadband increase in photocurrent throughout the visible
spectrum. Our experimental and computational results suggest that
the observed photocurrent enhancement in plasmonic OPVs originates
from both enhanced absorption and improved exciton dissociation and
charge collection. This is particularly achieved by placing metal
NCs near the interface of the active layer and hole-transport layer.
The impedance spectroscopy results suggest that Au–Ag NCs reduce
recombination and also increase the internal exciton to carrier efficiency
by driving the dissociation of bound charge-transfer states to free
carriers.

Introduction
Thin-film organic photovoltaics
(OPVs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to inorganic PVs due to inexpensive fabrication and processing
techniques. Whereas a few low band gap polymers with competitive efficiencies
are viable competitors in the solar market,1−3 the power conversion
efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs remain low relative to market-leading
inorganic PVs, such as Si, CdTe, or CuInGaSe2.4 A number of factors impact the performance of
the OPVs, including photon absorption, carrier generation, and carrier
collection. The contribution from each of these factors can be understood
from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) expression, which is the
wavelength-dependent metric for photon to charge carrier efficiency.
The expression for EQE is given by EQE(λ) = ηabs × ηgen × ηcoll, where
ηabs is the ratio of absorbed light to incident light,
ηgen is the ratio of photoexcited excitons that are
converted to free carriers, and ηcoll is the carrier
collection efficiency at the electrodes.5−7 In the archetypal OPV,
charge separation is facilitated by bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active
layers, where the high interfacial area between the continuous veins
of electron donor polymers and electron acceptor molecules provides
the driving force necessary for the generation of free carriers via
the separation of charge-transfer excitons.5,8 High
efficiencies in OPVs are ultimately limited by charge transport and
recombination (ηcoll); however, locally improving
the light absorption (ηabs) and the charge generation
rate near the collection interface has the potential to improve PCE.
Recent approaches to increasing PCE in OPVs have emphasized on improving
ηgen via the modification of the BHJ architecture
and the design of more efficient donor/acceptor systems,9−14 as well as enhancing ηabs by designing organic–inorganic
hybrid devices,15 tandem junctions,9,16 and incorporating metal nanocrystals (NCs) that support surface
plasmons.5,17,18 Augmentation
of light harvesting in OPVs has been achieved by embedding colloidal
metal NCs in the active layer19−22 and the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) hole-transport layer.5,23−26 Although metal-NC-enhanced OPVs have attracted significant interest
and resulted in 5–50% increase in photocurrents,26−29 the precise origin of plasmonic enhancement in OPVs has remained
elusive and has been primarily correlated with improved absorption.

In this work, we demonstrate that BHJ OPVs integrated with gold
core–silver shell NCs (Au–Ag NCs) show both increased
absorption via light scattering and enhanced local electromagnetic
fields, as well as electric field assisted exciton dissociation in
the OPVs. The Au–Ag NC-incorporated OPVs show a 9% increase
in efficiency relative to the reference devices from 2.85 to 3.1%
for best devices. Our experimental and theoretical analyses support
that the observed enhancements in photocurrent are collectively driven
by increases in ηabs, ηgen, and
ηcoll. The contribution from ηgen and ηcoll can be understood from the origin of
Frenkel-type excitons in conjugated polymers. Photoexcitation of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT) gives rise to Frenkel excitons where the Coulomb binding energy
restricts the electron–hole separation to ∼2 nm with
binding energy in the range of 0.4–1.0 eV, which is above the
threshold for dissociation.30,31 The unique geometry-driven
optical properties of Au–Ag NCs give rise to strong electric
fields in the vicinity of the NCs, which extend to tens of nanometers.
These strong electric fields improve the absorption (ηabs) near the P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS interface, as well as enhance the
conversion of bound Frenkel-type charge-transfer excitons to free
carriers, subsequently improving ηgen and the overall
photocurrent. Our proposed mechanism is supported by recent studies
which describe that nonequilibrium “hot” excitons at
the donor/acceptor interface in BHJ architectures contribute strongly
to carrier generation.32,33 This motivates our work where
we demonstrate that plasmonic enhancement in BHJ OPVs is catalyzed
by the interplay between charge-transfer excitons and surface plasmons
and is not simply a result of improved light absorption. We have combined
optical and optoelectronic characterization to study and understand
the performance Au–Ag NC-incorporated OPVs. Experimental observations
are supplemented with a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) model to support our hypothesis.

Results and Discussion
OPVs were fabricated by adapting a standard procedure from the
literature;18 details are available in
the Materials and Methods section. Au–Ag
NCs were embedded in the 70 nm thick PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer
of the OPVs. Embedding the NCs in the hole-transport layer minimizes
any change in the morphology of the active layer and prevents the
introduction of defects that can be detrimental to OPV performance.35 The 140 nm thick active layer is composed of
Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
(P3HT:PCBM). The plasmon resonance of Au–Ag NCs spans the visible
spectrum (Figure 1a),
which is ideal for OPVs where a broadband response results in increased
light capture. A representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
image of Au–Ag NCs features two distinct bimetallic geometries
(Figure 1b), nanocubes
and nanopyramids. The origin of these shapes lies in the synthesis
process and is described in detail in our previous work.36 Although the synthesis results in two distinct
geometries, this is advantageous in this work as the multiple geometries
result in a broad spectral resonance. The plasmon mode at 530 nm is
attributed to the dipole mode of the nanocubes, and that at 630 nm
is contributed by the dipolar resonance of the nanopyramids.37,38 The sharp corners and edges of Au–Ag NCs generate strong
local fields that extend up to 30 nm from the surface of the Au–Ag
NCs (see Figure S1). These intense fields
are a result of charge accumulation at the corners and edges of the
Au–Ag NCs, described as the lightning-rod effect, which is
frequently observed in nonspherical nanostructures.39−41

density vs potential (J–V) curves for OPVs at different Au–Ag NC particle densities
where the numbers refer to the NCs/μm2.

The PCE of OPVs is enhanced by 9% upon integrating
Au–Ag
NCs in the PEDOT:PSS layer (Figure 1c). Our average device efficiency of reference OPVs
was 2.58% (max 2.85%) and those of the best plasmon-enhanced devices
were 2.80% (max 3.10%). The concentration of Au–Ag NCs was
varied in the PEDOT:PSS solution before spin coating to determine
the effect of NC density on PCE enhancement. The particle density
was confirmed by examining the PEDOT:PSS layer by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and counting the number of Au–Ag NCs per area
(Figure S2). The effect of Au–Ag
NC concentration on the fill factor, short-circuit current density
(Jsc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc) is provided in Figure S3. The improvements in PCE were attributed to the increased
current density in the presence of the Au–Ag NCs, which peaks
at an area density of 0.25 NCs/μm2, as shown in the J–V curves in Figure 1d. The trend observed in PCE closely resembles
the trend in Jsc (Figure S3b), which likely results from two primary effects:
(1) increased overall light harvesting in the active layer (ηabs) and (2) increased exciton separation to collected carrier
efficiency (ηgen + ηcoll). At high
concentrations of Au–Ag NCs, the PCE is reduced due to the
formation of nanoparticle aggregates that increase recombination losses.
All device performance parameters are provided in Table S1.

To understand the origin of the photocurrent
enhancement, we compared
the EQE of a reference OPV (no NCs) to that with optimum Au–Ag
NC concentration (Figure 2a). The average EQE enhancement of 10% agrees with the 9%
enhancement found in PCE. The normalized EQE in Figure 2b suggests that the photocurrent enhancement
in the presence of Au–Ag NCs is broadband throughout the visible
region and does not show any spectral dependence overlapping with
the Au–Ag NC plasmon resonance (Figure 1a). The broadband enhancement is attributed
to the plasmon red-shift of Au–Ag NCs spanning the visible
and near-infrared and spectral broadening in the presence of PEDOT:PSS
(Figure S4). We measured the extinction
of the plasmon-enhanced devices relative to the reference OPVs (Figure 2c) and observed that
the two spectra overlapped to within 0.1% when integrated over the
visible spectrum. This indicates that the absorption contribution
from the nanoparticles when averaged over the entire cross section
of the active layer is minimal; however, we find that in the presence
of the Au–Ag NCs, the electric field preferentially increases
near the PEDOT:PSS interface where charge collection occurs. Simulations
(Figure 3) clearly
demonstrate that plasmonic enhancement of ∼35% is achieved
localized at the P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS interface averaged over the bottom
10 nm volume of the active layer. The lack of enhancement in the experiments
(Figure 2c) is because
experimental extinction is bulk measurements accounting for the entire
OPV. The spectrophotometer is unable to measure improved extinction
at the interface. However, we note that the strong radiative properties
of the Au–Ag NCs, attributed to both the size and the presence
of the Ag layer, are the driving force for the observed enhancement
in EQE and J–V curves.37,39 To demonstrate this, we also incorporated Au nanocubes (Figure S5a) without any Ag layer into devices.
Au nanocubes have narrow spectral resonance relative to Au–Ag
NCs (Figure S5b) and are primarily absorbing
rather than scattering (Figure S5c). Due
to their low scattering properties, we observed a decrease in EQE
relative to the reference (Figure S5d).

to the cross sections shown in (b) showing a 13% increase in absorbance
at the top of the OPV, a 35% increase near the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM
interface, and a 37% decrease in absorbance in the middle of the OPVs.

To further understand the origin
of plasmonic enhancement, FDTD
simulations were performed to measure the spatially dependent electric
field enhancement in the OPV (Figure 3). To gain an understanding of the plasmonic radiative
field strength of the Au–Ag NCs at different locations in the
OPV active layer, E-field monitors were placed at the top, middle,
and bottom of the P3HT:PCBM layer. These simulations demonstrate three
different effects across the OPV. First, the simulations show that
Au–Ag NCs have significant forward scattering into the active
layer, with spatially dependent average electric field intensity up
to 18× the incident field over the wavelength range of 400–700
nm. An ∼35% plasmonic enhancement is achieved in the OPVs localized
within 10 nm of the P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS interface (Figure 3b,c bottom), which is within
the electric field decay length of the Au–Ag NCs. The near
field decay length of Au–Ag NCs is within 30 nm from their
surface (Figure S1). Second, a 13% increase
in absorption is observed at the top of the OPV (140 nm from the PEDOT:PSS
interface) closer to the Al top electrode, which we attribute to backscattered
light from the Al electrode increasing the light harvested by the
OPVs. Third, in the middle of the OPVs (70 nm from the PEDOT:PSS interface),
there is an ∼37% decrease in absorbance in the presence of
the NCs. This decrease is because in the middle of the OPVs there
is no effect from backscattered light from the Al top electrode and
the electric fields from the Au–Ag NCs have already decayed.
Therefore, light re-radiated from the NCs (or Al electrode) does not
reach the middle of the OPV and instead we see parasitic effect that
reduces the overall absorbance in the presence of the NCs. Collectively,
the three effects correlate well with the experimental enhancement
of 9% observed in the PCE and J–V curves (Figure 1c,d)
and EQE (Figure 2a)
from the plasmonic devices. But we anticipate that the increase in
absorption at the interface of the active layer and hole-transport
layer likely contributes to the increased photocurrent, as the carrier
generation profile is strongly skewed toward the illumination side
of the device. The simulated OPV with the Au−Ag nanopyramid
embedded in the hole transport layer generates similar results and
is shown in Figure S6. It has been proposed
by Fung et al.17 that increased roughness
at the PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM interface due to incorporation of nanoparticles
could increase the interfacial area for charge separation, thereby
increasing PCE. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure S7) indicate that the average roughness
at the interface is <1 nm in both reference and NC-incorporated
samples, which likely does not contribute to performance enhancement.
We note that the roughness measurement from AFM images occurs on a
length scale (10’s of nanometer) that is orders of magnitude
lower than the spacing between the NCs (microns) even at the highest
NC concentration. At the highest concentration (∼0.4 NCs/μm2), with an average NC edge length of 80 nm, the bimetallic
NCs cover a negligible fraction of the surface (0.26%). Therefore,
the incorporation of Au–Ag NCs into the OPVs will have minimal
effect on the overall roughness, interfacial area, and charge transport.

To further understand plasmonic enhancement in OPVs by Au–Ag
NCs, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Nyquist
plots of reference OPVs and best-performing Au–Ag NC embedded
OPVs at a particle concentration of 0.25 NCs/μm2 are
shown in Figure 4a.
The Nyquist plots are fit to an equivalent circuit model (Figure 4b), which has four
components: series resistance (Rs), recombination
resistance (Rr), contact capacitance (Cc), and Gerischer impedance (G). G represents diffusion of separated charges.
The high-frequency region shown in the Nyquist plot is attributed
to Rr and Cc owing to charge buildup between the P3HT:PCBM active layer and its
adjacent contacts, including the PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer and
the LiF electron-transport layer. According to circuit model fits,
Au–Ag NC integration did not significantly alter the Rs value relative to the reference OPVs but lowered Rr (24% decrease), Cc (25% decrease), and Gerischer impedance, G, (82%
decrease). The fit parameters are included in Table S2. These results indicate that bimetallic NCs decrease
carrier recombination and promote diffusion across the PEDOT:PSS layer,
improving the charge generation and collection efficiency (ηgen + ηcoll). Bode phase plots were used to
examine the behavior of charged species within the reference and plasmon-enhanced
OPVs at different particle concentrations of Au–Ag NCs (Figure 4c). The Bode phase
peak frequency decreases as the Au–Ag NC concentration increases.
The phase represents the shift of the input phase; the frequency at
the maximum phase shift of these OPVs is proportional to the inverse
of the electron lifetime. Equation 1 shows the relationship between the frequency at peak
phase shift and carrier lifetime.42 1  The effective lifetime of carriers, τeff, decreases
from ∼4.0 to ∼2.5 μs with
the addition of Au–Ag NCs (Figure 4d). We attribute the decrease in τeff to two distinct factors resulting from the presence of
the Au–Ag NCs and the subsequent enhanced electric field: (1)
increased carrier generation and (2) decreased carrier diffusion length.
As is shown in Figure 3, the presence of Au–Ag NCs causes regions of intense electric
field, which in turn creates carrier concentrations higher than those
in reference cells, leading to increased probability for carrier collision,
a phenomenon that has been previously demonstrated in the literature.43 Additionally, because the electric field is
distorted such that charge generation is concentrated near the P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS
interface in the presence of Au–Ag NCs (Figure 3), the required diffusion length to carrier
collection is shortened, thus the free carrier lifetime decreases.
This is in agreement with the decrease in Gerischer impedance in the
presence of the NCs, which is representative of diffusion of separated
charges across the hole-transport layer.

On the basis of our experimental and simulated
results, our hypothesis
is that the strong electric fields generated by Au–Ag NCs collectively
improve the absorption efficiency (ηabs), carrier
generation efficiency (ηgen), and charge collection
efficiency (ηcoll) in our system. Strong electric
fields in conjugated polymers have been shown to be capable of providing
sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation,44−46 yet this concept
has not been emphasized in plasmonic OPV systems. To further understand
the origin of the enhanced performance of the Au–Ag NC-incorporated
devices, we analyzed the photocurrents of the reference and the best
plasmonic device (Figure 5) as a function of the effective potential (Veff).26Figure 5 shows a plot of the photocurrent density
(Jph = Jlight – Jdark) at AM 1.5 illumination
versus the effective voltage (Veff = V0 – Va),
where V0 is the potential where Jph equals zero, and Va is the applied potential (Figure 5a). This plot was used to calculate the maximum exciton
generation rate, Gmax, which is given
by Jsat = qGmaxL, where Jsat is the
saturated or maximum Jph that is obtained
at higher potential, q is the electronic charge,
and L is the active layer thickness. The Jsat values for our reference and plasmonic devices
were 72 and 77 A m–2, respectively, and resulted
in Gmax values of 3.21 × 1027 and 3.43 × 1027 m–3 s–1, respectively. As q and L are
constant in both devices, this 6.4% improvement in Gmax from the reference to plasmonic OPVs indicates a direct
enhancement in exciton generation in the active layer. We also calculated
the exciton dissociation probability, P(E,
T), which simply provides a measure of effective charge separation
(Figure 5b). P(E, T) was calculated
under the short-circuit condition (Va =
0), where Jph = qGmaxP(E, T)L. We calculated that the Jph values at Va = 0 were 67.7 and
74.5 mA cm–2 resulting in P(E, T) of 94 and 97%, for the reference
and plasmonic devices, respectively, indicating that the presence
of the NCs increased the dissociation of excitons into free carriers.
We observe that Jph and P(E, T) are both higher for the
plasmonic OPVs in the saturation current region (Veff > 0.25 V) where the electrical and thermal carriers
play a role. But in the undersaturated region, both Jph and P(E, T) are higher for the reference OPVs. We attribute this
phenomenon to decreased series resistance in the plasmonic devices
at high bias in the dark (Figure S8), indicating
that the NCs likely play a role in charge transport even in the absence
of light when the plasmon is not excited. However, further study is
required to fully elucidate the cause of this phenomenon. These P(E, T) values correlate
well with those observed in the literature and support our initial
hypothesis that the observed enhancements in photocurrent are collectively
driven by increases in ηabs, ηgen, and ηcoll.26,27

and best plasmonic device. (b) Probability for exciton dissociation

The open-circuit (Voc) condition is shown

The presence of Au–Ag NCs
in our BHJ OPVs not only improves
the absorption (ηabs) near the P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS
interface but also promotes dissociation of Frenkel-type charge-transfer
excitons in P3HT. Upon photoexcitation of the P3HT:PCBM active layer,
a tightly bound exciton with a diffusion length of ∼10 nm is
formed.7 In the reference OPVs, free carriers
are formed when the exciton diffuses to the donor/acceptor interface
and sufficient energy is available for charge separation. In the Au–Ag
NC-incorporated OPVs, two effects simultaneously impact the performance:
(1) Strong radiative enhancement—contributed by the intense
near-fields and light scattering from the Au–Ag NCs localized
within 10 nm of the interface of the active layer and hole-transport
layer, as shown in our simulated results (Figure 3). This 35% increase in absorbance increases
the absorption efficiency (ηabs) concentrated near
the interface of the active layer and hole-transport layer. (2) Enhanced
exciton dissociation near a charge collection interface—the
strong electric fields of Au–Ag NCs in the vicinity of the
NCs increase the probability for the dissociation of charge-transfer
excitons in P3HT, improving the photoexcited exciton to carrier generation
efficiency (ηgen). These separated electrons and
holes are in the proximity of the hole conductor, PEDOT:PSS, which
facilitates efficient charge collection efficiency (ηcoll).

In summary, we have fabricated plasmon-enhanced P3HT:PCBM
OPVs
by embedding bimetallic Au core–Ag shell NCs in the PEDOT:PSS
hole-transport layer. PCE improved by 9% relative to the reference
at the optimized concentration of Au–Ag NCs. Our experimental
and simulated results suggest that Au–Ag NCs result in broadband
enhancement in the visible and near-infrared spectrum due to improved
absorption and increased charge separation, where strong electric
fields of Au–Ag NCs assist in separating bound Frenkel-type
excitons. EIS measurements support our hypothesis that plasmonic enhancement
in our system also results from increased internal exciton to carrier
efficiency and increased charge collection, in addition to increased
photon to carrier efficiency. We envision that by carefully controlling
the interplay between surface plasmons and charge-transfer excitons,
metal nanostructures can be designed to have dual roles—as
light harvesters which will improve ηabs, and as
a driving force for exciton dissociation and carrier collection which
will improve ηgen and ηcoll. Energy
up-conversion via plasmon–exciton coupling may play a role
in increasing the absorption of low-energy light in conjugated polymers
and could be potentially explored in the future. We anticipate that
this work will provide design rules for the fabrication of plasmonic
OPVs with improved efficiencies, reduced recombination, and better
carrier collection efficiency across the charge-transport layers.
These enhancements controlled by electric fields of shape- and size-controlled
plasmonic nanostructures will ultimately enable thin-film, flexible
devices viable for large-scale manufacture and integration.

Materials
and Methods
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
unless noted otherwise;
all water was nanopure from a Milli-Q Direct-Q 3UV system. All work
conducted under inert atmosphere was conducted in a nitrogen environment
in an M-Braun LabStar glovebox (>0.5 ppm O2). Thermal
evaporation
was conducted on an Angstrom Amod system.

NC Synthesis
Bimetallic
NCs were synthesized by a modified
procedure in our previous work47 and consisted
of three steps: seed growth, Au nanocube growth, and Ag capping layer
growth.

Seed Solution
A solution of 2.75 mL water, 7.5 mL 100
mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and 250 μL 10 mM HAuCl4 were added to a 10 mL glass vial, mixed by inversion, and
placed in a 35 °C water bath for temperature equilibration. After
10 min, 600 μL of ice cold, freshly prepared 10 mM NaBH4 solution was injected with vigorous stirring, followed by
1 min of stirring before being returned to the 35 °C water bath
for 1 h undisturbed.

Au Nanocube Growth
The seed solution
was removed from
the water bath and reduced 10× with water. Next, in a 50 mL vial,
6.4 mL 100 mM CTAB, 800 μL 10 mM HAuCl4, 3.8 mL 100
mM ascorbic acid, and 20 μL diluted seed solution were added
and mixed by inversion. The vial was then placed in a 35 °C water
bath and allowed to sit undisturbed for 5 h.

Ag Capping Layer Growth
Au nanocubes (7.5 mL) were
centrifuged at 1100 rcf for 15 min, the supernatant removed and the
pellet redispersed in 3.75 mL of 20 mM hexadecyl trimethylammonium
chloride (CTAC) and allowed to sit for 15 min. The centrifugation
and redispersal step was repeated two additional times; however, on
the final redispersal, the pellet was combined with 500 μL water,
rather than a CTAC solution. Next, 20 mL 20 mM CTAC, 800 μL
concentrated Au nanocubes from the previous step, and 200 μL
10 mM KBr were combined in a 50 mL vial and placed in a 65 °C
water bath. After 10 min, the vial was removed from the water bath
and mixed by inversion with 220 μL of 10 mM AgNO3 and 600 μL 100 mM ascorbic acid. Finally, the vial was placed
in a 65 °C water bath for 2 h. The colloid was stable for up
to 60 days in the dark at 2 °C.

Device Fabrication
ITO glass (150 nm, <10 Å
RMS roughness) was purchased from Thin Film Devices Inc. Phenyl-C61-butyric
acid (PCBM) was purchased from Rieke Materials, and P3HT was from
Sigma-Aldrich (698989). OPV fabrication was adapted from a procedure
in the literature.48 One inch ITO glass
squares were cleaned with acetone and isopropanol and dried with nitrogen,
followed by air plasma treatment for 10 min to remove any organic
residue. Next, a solution of PEDOT:PSS was filtered through a 0.45
μm PVDF filter and concentrated Au–Ag NCs were spin coated
onto the cleaned substrates at 1500 rpm for 60 seconds and dried at
120 °C for 10 min, then transferred to an inert environment.
Under inert atmosphere, 20 mg P3HT and 16 mg PCBM were combined with
720 μL dichlorobenzene and stirred at 125 °C for 30 min,
then allowed to be stirred at room temperature overnight. A 100 μL
drop of P3HT:PCBM solution was spin cast onto the PEDOT:PSS coated
substrates at 500 rpm for 5 s and 2000 rpm for 13 s, followed by immediate
transfer to a dichlorobenzene environment until the film transitioned
from bright orange to dark red/purple. This solvent annealing step
was essential for the formation of the BHJ and dictates the charge
separation and charge-transfer efficiency. The substrate was kept
in an inert environment and transferred to a vacuum evaporation chamber
where 1 nm LiF and 100 nm Al were deposited in 8 mm diameter circles
via shadow masks.

Material Characterization
All optical
spectroscopic
measurements were carried out with a Varian Cary 5000 ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometer. SEM and TEM were conducted using a Zeiss Merlin
and FEI Osiris, respectively. A Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer was
used for all layer thickness measurements. AFM was performed on a
Bruker Dimension Icon AFM.

Photoelectrical Characterization
All current–potential
scans were conducted under AM 1.5G 100 mW/cm2 illumination
at a 10 mV/s scan rate using a MetroOhm Autolab potentiostat. EIS
was conducted with an amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency range of
103−106 Hz. Quantum efficiency measurements
were conducted on a homemade setup using a Fianum supercontinuum laser,
a Thorlabs PM100D power meter, and a Keithley 2600 sourcemeter. To
block any additional current via lateral charge transport, shadow
masks were used.

Electrodynamic Modeling
All electrodynamic
modeling
was carried out in Lumerical FDTD Solutions software with a simulation
time of 500 fs and a spectral range of 400–700 nm. The solar
cell stack of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al had thicknesses of 100/70/140/100
nm, respectively. All metal/dielectric interfaces were contained in
