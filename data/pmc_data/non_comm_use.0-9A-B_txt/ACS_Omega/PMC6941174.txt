In this work, we report the covalent functionalization
of tris(2-aminoethyl)amine
(tren) onto the graphene oxide surface by the ring opening of epoxide
with primary amine moieties. The effect of intercalation creates the
covalent coordinating moieties in between the basal planes of graphene
oxide by increasing the interlayer spacing of 1.08 nm from 0.75 nm
and thereby decreasing 2θ of 8.17 deg from 10.46 deg. Because
of the intercalation of tren, the aminoalcohol moieties are formed
in the GO planes and the intercalated material is characterized by
the spectroscopic (IR, XPS, UV, and Fluorescence) and microscopic
techniques. The DFT calculation shows the newly formed C–N
bond length of 1.484 Å and enhanced energy gap due to functionalization.
The intercalated material shows a good selective fluorescent chemosensor
for the cerium ion in aqueous solution. The reversibility and its
interference with other competing metal ions have been studied. The
enhanced fluorescence upon the addition of cerium ions is due to the
intramolecular charge transfer and photoinduced electron transfer
processes in the sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon
networks.

Introduction
Recently, carbon based two-dimensional
material research has been
focused much on the oxidative derivative of graphene called graphene
oxide (GO) for further chemical functionalization through the oxygen-containing
functional groups such as epoxides, hydroxyls, and terminal carboxylic
acids.1−5 These class of intercalated materials find enormous application
toward optoelectronics,6 solar cells,7 supercapacitors,8 field
emission transistors,9 smart sensors,10 nanocomposites, batteries,11 and biomedical device applications.12 Additionally, surface modification of GO has fascinated
great attention due to the presence of both sp2- and sp3-carbon networks and extended possibility for covalent functionalization
of heteroatoms (−NH, −OH, and −SH), ensuing assured
applications in the advanced technologies.13 GO exhibits the photoluminescence property due to the disruption
of the carbon matrix during oxidation or covalent functionalization
process,14 which contain the paired electron
holes that are localized with the sp2- and sp3- hybridized carbon domain.15 Chemical
functionalization of GO was classified into two categories: (a) covalent
functionalization due to the ring opening of epoxide by the nucleophilic
attack16,17 or amide formation through the activation
of terminal carboxylic acids18 and (b)
noncovalent functionalization through Van der Waals interaction on
the surface of GO.19,20 It was reported that the structure
disorder leads to the fluorescence due to the optical transition from
the localized states in the π–π* transitions gap
of sp2-carbon through the intercalation process and also
by the quantum confinement effect.21,22

Shang
et al.,23 have reported that the
presence of functionalized groups from the sp3-hybridized
carbons causes the fluorescence. The noncovalent interaction of anthracene–imidazolium
salt with the reduced GO hybrid material exhibits strong fluorescence
with a quantum yield of 0.29 due to the electron transfer between
GO and the anthracene moieties.24 Eda et
al.,25 have reviewed the tunable optoelectronic
properties of chemically derived GO materials with its heterogeneous
electronic structure.26 The origin of fluorescence
has been derived from the recombination of the electron–hole
in the nearby localized states of conduction band and the wide range
of the valence band.27 It is worth noting
that the functionalization of enriched heteroatoms in the GO planes
lead to the formation of sp3-sites which eventually contributes
to the fluorescence.28

In this present
work, we report the covalent functionalization
of GO with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (GO–tren) for the creation
of covalent coordinating moieties in between the GO planes. The choice
of the tren molecule for the intercalation is to create covalent coordination
moiety on the surface of GO through the epoxide ring opening which
eventually forms aminoalcohol moieties with penta coordination for
metal complexation. Because of the intercalation, a significant enhancement
of interlayer d-spacing is observed, and thereby,
it opens an avenue for metal coordination. It is our interest to study
the fluorescent behavior of the GO–tren material with the formation
of disordered sp2- and sp3-carbon networks upon
intercalation and perform with various metal ions in the tetrahydrofuran–water
mixture. Upon the addition of the cerium metal ion, the enhanced fluorescence
was observed and suggested the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).

Results and Discussion
Material Preparation
The starting material, GO, was
synthesized by the previously reported method.29 The covalent functionalization of GO was performed in the
mixture of solvents, tetrahydrofuran–water in a well-dispersed
condition. The resulting solution appeared black after 3 days, and
the crude intercalated material was centrifuged. The black solid was
washed with cold tetrahydrofuran to remove the unreacted tren, which
was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography. The amino alcohol moieties
were formed in the GO surface due to the epoxide ring opening by the
nucleophilic attack of the primary amine moiety in tren. The remaining
intercalated GO material was characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic
techniques. The schematic representation of covalent intercalation
of the tren molecule on the surface of GO is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of covalent intercalation of tren in the
GO basal planes.

DFT Calculations
Density field theory (DFT) calculations
are performed to understand the surface modification of GO due to
the covalent intercalation of the tren molecule. The optimized structure
of GO, tren, and GO–tren material is shown in Figure S1, and their geometrical parameters are listed in
Table S1 (refer the Supporting Information). The optimized energy of GO and tren at the HF/6-31g level of theory
is found to be −69 209.46 and −12 370.46
eV, respectively. The single-point calculation at the B3LYP/6-311++g**
level predicts the energy of the GO and tren to be −69 674.83
and −12 460.56 eV, respectively. Upon intercalation,
the optimized energy of GO–tren is −81 594.23
eV and single-point energy is −82 153.16 eV.

The
nucleophilic attack on the epoxy rings in GO sheets leads to the formation
of hydroxyl group referred to the amino alcohol moiety. A significant
interaction between C(24) of GO and N(1) of the tren with a C–N
bond length of 1.484 Å is identified. The notable variation in
the geometrical parameters between the intercalated material and the
monomers is observed (Table 1). The interaction energies of the complex calculated at ab
initio and DFT levels are found to be −14.31 eV (−0.526
Hartrees) and −17.77 eV (−0.653 Hartrees), which confirm
strong intercalation of GO and tren. The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for
GO30 and its complex are calculated at
B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory, and it is depicted in Figure 2.

All of the values are given in terms of eV and are calculated by using
HOMO and LUMO energies.

The highest electrophilicity (5.647 eV) and electronegativity
(3.447
eV) are observed for GO which denotes that it accepts more electrons.
The high global hardness (1.106 eV) and lower softness (0.904 eV)
obtained for GO–tren confirms the molecular stability of the
complex.31 The HOMO and LUMO energies of
GO are −4.498 and −2.395 eV and henceforth their energy
gap (ΔE) value is found to be 2.103 eV. These
values are in good agreement with the GO-based material functionalized
with aminoazobenzene reported by Gupta et al.32 The Gibbs free energy corrected to zero point energy for GO–tren
is calculated to be −1.354 kJ/mol and the negative value clearly
indicates the intercalation between the planes. The number of benzene
rings in the GO sheets and the intercalating molecule does have an
effect on the orbital energy values as well explained by Mondal et
al.,33 The hybridization of GO orbitals
due to tren increases the orbital band energy value to 2.211 eV. Demir
and Akman34 have reported that the lowest
energy gap has high polarizability, high chemical reactivity, and
low kinetic stability. In our case, the GO monomer has a comparatively
smaller energy gap which indicates that it readily reacts with amine
for the formation of intercalated materials.

Characterization of GO–Tren
The powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) of GO–tren is performed to examine the effect
of the intercalated structure of GO and its crystallinity upon the
functionalization of the tren molecule. The XRD patterns of GO and
GO–tren are presented in Figure 3. The intercalated GO–tren material shows an
enhanced interlayer spacing of 1.08 nm from 0.75 nm with the decrease
of 2θ(002) = 8.17° from 10.46° of GO, which indicates
that the tren is intercalated covalently in between the basal planes
of GO. It confirms that the nucleophilicity of the primary amine attacks
the epoxide moieties on the GO surface leading to the formation of
amino alcohol moieties, and thereby, the enhanced interlayer d-spacing between the GO layers is observed. The mean crystallite
thickness (t) of 23 Å (72 Å for GO) was
calculated for the GO–tren material using the Debye–Scherrer
equation (refer the Supporting Information), and the number of layers for the functionalized GO–tren
was theoretically calculated as 2.3.

GO–tren.

SEM and TEM Images
The surface morphology, layer arrangement,
effect of intercalation, and the nanostructures of as-prepared functionalized
GO–tren and GO are characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images (Figure 4a,b). The SEM images show the sheet- and flake-like structures with
relatively large surface area can be seen. The images of the sheets
reveal the penetration of intercalated tren to the stack arrangement
through the edge to center process which eventually increased the
space between the GO sheets. Upon covalent functionalization, the
changes in the morphology of the intercalated GO material are seen
using transition electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images of GO–tren
and GO are shown in Figure 4c,d. It clearly shows the formation of few layers, and its
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern indicates the existence
of plane crystallinity upon intercalation in the few sheets of GO.35 The intensity of diffractions is decreased,
as compared to the GO, which corresponds to the presence of tren moieties
on the surface of GO layers.

XPS Analysis
The surface chemical composition and chemical
state of the GO–tren material was studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The survey spectrum and deconvoluted
spectra are shown in Figure 5a. The survey spectrum of GO–tren shows the significant
variations from the GO spectrum, in terms of C 1s binding energies
and the presence of the new N 1s band at 399–405 eV which confirms
the successful functionalization on the GO planes. The deconvoluted
bands of C 1s spectra appears at 284.9, 285.6, 286.9, 289.9, 292.3,
and 293.5 eV corresponding to the C 1s C–C/C=C, C–N,
C–OH of hydroxyl, C=O of carboxylic acid, O–C=O
bonds, respectively. The N 1s spectrum shows the deconvoluted band
peaks at 399.2, 400.8, and 404.9 eV attributed to the N–H,
NH2, and N protonated bonds, respectively (Figure 5c). In the case of the O 1s
spectrum, the strong peaks at 531.9, 534.7, and 536.8 corresponds
to the C=O, C–O, and O–singly bounded to aromatic
carbons, respectively.

spectrum
of GO–tren, (c) XPS N 1s spectrum of GO–tren, and (d)
XPS O 1s spectrum of GO–tren.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum
of GO–tren
confirms the intercalation of tren into the basal plane of GO by shifting
the epoxide C–O stretching in GO to 1021 cm–1, indicating the formation of primary alcohol moieties. It shows
in Figure 6a that the
peaks at 3417 and 2923 cm–1 correspond to NH and
OH stretching frequencies in −NH, −NH2, and
−OH bonds, respectively. The peaks appearing at 1632, 1436,
and 875 cm-1 are attributed to NH bending, NH deformative
vibrations from the NH bonds, and C–N stretching vibrations
in GO–tren, respectively.

Figure 6 (a) IR spectra of GO–tren and GO
and (b) UV spectra of GO–tren
and GO.

The UV spectrum of GO–tren is compared with
GO to confirm
the impact of intercalation in the GO sheets. The strong absorption
peak at 230 nm corresponds to π–π* transitions
of aromatic C=C bonds and a shoulder at 301 nm is attributed
to n–π* transitions of C=O bonds.
The GO–tren material that shows the redshift to 242 nm (Figure 6b) is due to the
functionalization on the basal planes, and n–π*
transitions appear at 324 nm which also confirms no reduction of GO
during the functionalization.

The thermal stability of the GO
and GO–tren is compared
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which are shown in Figure 7. GO–tren shows a slight
weight loss of 15–20% due to the removal of residual water
molecules and few labile oxygen-containing moieties on the surface
of GO until 210 °C. Thereafter, the slow decomposition with around
30% of weight loss of functionalized groups is observed between 230
and 900 °C.36 The improved thermal
stability of GO–tren is observed mainly due to the covalent
intercalation of the tren molecule.37

Selectivity of Metal Ion Studies
The fluorescence behavior
of GO–tren nanosheets in the presence of various metal ions
is studied, and their corresponding fluorescence spectra are shown
in Figure 8a. The covalent-functionalized
GO–tren material shows a remarkable enhancement of fluorescent
intensity at the emission maximum at 332 nm upon the addition of cerium
metal ions (100 equiv) to the receptor-dispersed solution of GO–tren.
It is observed that the appearance of a peak with the redshift of
the fluorescent intensity at 405 nm at an excitation of 275 nm wavelength
shows a significant enhancement of fluorescence when compared to the
other metal ions. It is evident that the disordered carbon network
is formed by the intercalation of the tren moiety on the basal planes
of GO, and it is highly selective toward cerium ions compared to other
metal cations. The intercalated GO–tren material detects cerium
ions as an “off-on” fluorescent probe in the mixture
of solvents (tetrahydrofuran–water) at neutral pH.

Figure 8 (a) GO–tren
with metal ions for selectivity, (b) interference
with other competent metal ions, as shown in Figure 9a, the fluorescence titrations of GO–tren was performed
by the addition of various concentrations of cerium metal ions (10–100
equiv). It is observed that the fluorescent intensity is gradually
increased and reached the saturation level around 100 equiv. It is
worth noting to report the shifting of the peak to 405 nm, indicating
the possibility of ICT between the GO and the intercalated amine within
the GO sheets.36 Because of the photoelectron
transfer, the quenching of fluorescence intensity is blocked and thereby
it creates a path for the ICT process.

Interaction with Other Competent Metal Ions for Selectivity
The interference of GO–tren with other competent metal ions
for the selectivity of cerium ions is performed through the competitive
complex formation (Figure 8b). The change in fluorescent intensity is recorded upon the
addition of equimolar concentration of other metal ions (100 equiv)
to the dispersed test solution containing cerium ions. It is observed
that no transmetallation takes place with the detection of cerium
ions which confirms that the GO–tren material detects cerium
ions selectively.

Reversibility of GO–tren and Ce3+ with EDTA
The binding behavior of Ce3+ ions with GO–tren
in the presence of the hexadentate ligand; EDTA was performed in the
solvent mixture tetrahydrofuran–water (1:1 v/v, Tris buffer-30
mM at pH 7.2). The fluorescence intensity was measured by the addition
of 100 equiv of EDTA to the dispersed solution with the variation
of time at an excitation of 275 nm. After 48 h, the slow disappearance
of the fluorescence signal (Figure 9b) indicates the cerium metal ions reversible binding
with EDTA which normally forms Ce3+–EDTA stable
complex. It is also evident that the complexation of cerium ions with
GO–tren is relatively weaker than EDTA due to the availability
of higher coordination sites.

Figure 9 (a) Fluorescence spectra of the GO–tren
material with various
concentrations of cerium and (b) reversibility with the external addition
of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Because of the intercalation of tren with dispersed
GO, the strained
epoxide ring is cleaved by the nucleophilic attack of the primary
amine in the tren molecule and an additional coordination site in
the GO planes is formed. It is also suggested that another primary
amine reacts with the GO plane and forms interlayer spacing with a
distance of 1.08 nm. Upon the addition of cerium ions, the available
lone pair is involved in bonding with the electron-deficient Ce3+ ion that inhibits the photoinduced electron transfer process.
However, the higher vibrational energy in the excited states of the
graphene sheet is shared through an ICT in the form of nonradiative
decays with a significant fluorescence shift.

Conclusions
The intercalation of graphene oxide with
tren is performed by the
nucleophilic ring opening of epoxide for the formation of covalent
aminoalcohols on the surface of the GO. The functionalized GO–tren
material shows the increased interlayer d-spacing
compared with the normal GO due to the covalent functionalization.
DFT calculation also supports the intercalation of GO–tren
with the slight variation in the band gap and disordered sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon networks exist in the intercalated
material. The fluorescent behavior of the intercalated material is
studied with various metal ions for the selectivity and its reversibility
of binding for the cerium ion detection. The enhancement fluorescence
in aqueous medium is plausibly due to the photoinduced electron transfer
and ICT process. Eventually, the creation of covalent coordination
moieties in between the GO basal plane pays huge impact in the sensing
of selective metal ions or removal of heavy metal ions in the aqueous
medium toward the environment applications.

Experimental Sections
Synthesis of GO–tren
To the dispersed solution
of GO (2 gm) in 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran and water (20:80 v/v), tris(2-ethylamino)ethylamine
(tren, 2 gm) in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran was added over a period of
3 h under vigorous stirring at RT. The solution was stirred for 3
days at RT to get black color solution. The dispersed mixture was
centrifuged, and the black solid was washed thrice with tetrahydrofuran
(80 mL) to remove unreacted tren. The resulting black solid was washed
and centrifuged with water (3 × 100 mL). The wet solid was washed
with ethanol (3 × 80 mL) and diethylether thrice to obtain the
GO–tren material as a free-flow black solid.

Characterization of GO–tren
XRD patterns for
as-prepared functionalized materials were recorded on a Shimadzu XRD-6000
Powder X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV voltages and 30 mA current. FT-IR
spectra were recorded on IR-Prestise-21, Shimadzu. Scanning electron
microscopy was carried out on JEOL model JSM-6390 for all of the samples.
Absorption spectra were recorded on a shimadzu UV-240 spectrophotometer.
Raman spectra were recorded on a Horiba–Jobin Raman spectrometer
with a 514 nm laser at a power. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy and SAED measurements were conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100
for the surface morphology of GO and GO–tren. Fluorescence
measurements were recorded in a Jasco FP-8200 spectrofluorometer with
a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length.
