Tramadol (Td) is a centrally acting
opioid analgesic drug used
for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, the half-life
of Td is about 6–8 h, which is a major drawback. To increase
the half-life of Td, it needs to be entrapped in a suitable substrate
with the capability to release the drug for an extended period of
time. Accordingly, in our studies, new protein blends in various compositions
were prepared using hydrophilic (egg albumin) and hydrophobic (zein)
proteins and fabricated them as nanoparticles with Td by the desolvation
method. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized using analytical
techniques. The morphology and diameter of the nanoparticles were
determined by an environmental scanning electron microscope. The interactions
between Td and proteins were confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy,
and the secondary structural changes were evaluated by circular dichroism.
The hemolysis test and MTT assay indicated that the nanoparticles
were nontoxic, and drug release studies showed an extended duration
of release of Td for more than 48 h. The mechanism of the drug release
followed the zero order. The overall studies inferred that these protein
based nanoparticles have potential to release Td at a slow rate for
an extended period of time. Further manipulation of the protein composition
may regulate the duration of Td release for an effective therapy.

1 Introduction
In
drug delivery, nanomedicine is becoming more popular because
the formulations of drugs in the nanoform provide better efficacy
at lower concentration and the availability of drug is more at the
site of action for the improvement of patient compliance. Accordingly,
to design nanomaterials for suitable application, biocompatible, natural,
and modified synthetic polymers are being studied extensively.

Proteins are hydrophilic or hydrophobic multifunctional polymers
derived from renewable resources and are available in abundance at
affordable prices. Therefore, proteins are being extensively studied
as drug delivery systems in various forms such as nanofibers, nanoparticles,
microparticles, films, and scaffolds.1−4 The commonly used proteins are albumin,
zein (Ze), collagen, milk casein, soy, whey, and gelatin.5−9 Egg albumin (EA) is an abundant protein obtained from egg whites,
where the molecular weight is about 40–50 kDa, it is hydrophilic
and easily soluble in water, and it has free sulfhydryl (−SH)
groups, which on heating form disulfide (S–S) linkages producing
stable cross-linked structures.10 There
are few reports on EA for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications11−14 and very few reports on drug delivery systems.15 Besides, Ze is a water insoluble protein obtained from
corn and it is recognized as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by
the Food and Drug Administration. Ze being hydrophobic, when dispersed
in water it forms aggregates. The aggregates of Ze can be stabilized
by increasing the ionic strength or by altering the pH of the dispersing
media.10 Ze showed good biocompatibility
as the degraded components of the Ze were easily absorbed and metabolized16 and therefore being used as micro- and nanoparticles
for drug delivery.7 There are few reports
on hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs immobilized in Ze nanoparticles
for slow and controlled drug release.17−20 However, hydrophobicity of Ze
is one of the limiting factors for its drug delivery application because
it inhibits interaction with cells and therefore it cannot be used
for invasive delivery of drugs. To expand the scope of this protein,
the hydrophobicity of it has to be reduced, which can be manipulated
either by functional modification or by physical blending with a hydrophilic
polymer. Blending Ze with a hydrophilic polymer would be easy, simple,
and economically viable. Ze, modified Ze, and their blends were reported
as drug delivery systems. For example, Cheng has stabilized Ze by
i-carrageenan, while Wang et al. used sodium caseinate to provide
the electrostatic and steric interactions, which prevent Ze nanoparticles
from aggregations.21,22 In another study Ze nanoparticles
loaded with 5-fluorouracil were administered via intravenous injection
for liver targeting.19 However, new systems
using compatible protein combinations are always encouraged in nanomedicine
so that the properties of drug delivery will be improved.

Tramadol
(Td) is a centrally acting opioid analgesic drug used
for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Among the various opioids
used, Td is considered to have low risk of dependence with low abuse
potential. Generally, Td is administered orally; however, it has a
very short half-life, which is 6–8 h. Increasing the half-life
of the drug by immobilizing in a suitable polymer matrix and controlling
the rate of release of drug will be an added value in terms of safety
and side effects of the drug. Accordingly, there are reports on the
application of natural and synthetic polymers as Td carriers for extended
release.23−26 The carriers developed for release studies were for oral or parenteral
administration, which showed release for 25 h.27−29 Extending the
duration of release for more hours by manipulating the properties
of the polymers would enable the improved efficacy of the Td application.
Therefore, in the present study, we for the first time report the
preparation of nanoparticles using EA and Ze, where we could control
the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties to extend the rate of release
of Td. The present study involves (i) the preparation of nanoparticles
of EA–Ze in various compositions, (ii) analysis of surface
morphology and functional and physical properties of nanoparticles
by ESEM, FTIR, DSC, and XRD, (iii) interactions of Td with proteins
using fluorescence spectroscopy and structural changes by CD, (iv)
evaluation of Td release to understand the duration of release, and
(v) cell viability and hemolysis studies to identify the toxicity
and compatibility of the nanoparticles.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Molecular Weight
Individual solutions
of the commercially obtained products of EA and Ze were prepared,
precipitated, and lyophilized to obtain pure products. Gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) was used for determining the molecular weights of pure
EA and Ze proteins. The molecular weight of EA was 44 kDa, whereas
Ze recorded two molecular weights, 22 and 24 kDa. The molecular weights
of the respective proteins as determined were in accordance with the
reported values10,30 (Figure S1).

2.2 Nanoparticles and Surface Morphology
The respective nanoparticles of heat cross-linked EA and blends of
EA and Ze with and without Td were prepared (Table 1). The desolvation method was used for preparation
of nanoparticles according to the procedure as explained in the Materials and Methods section. Proteins, for example,
gelatin, collagen, and bovine serum albumin, are generally cross-linked
by chemical cross-linkers such as glutaraldehyde, genipin, and carbodiimide
to obtain stable materials. However these chemical cross-linkers are
considered to be toxic to a certain extent, and one has to be cautious
while using them. Therefore, alternative and safe methods are under
consideration. EA is abundant with sulfhydryl (−SH) groups,
which on heating form irreversible disulfide linkages. Hence, the
developed nanoparticles were cross-linked at 50 °C for 4 h, thereby
avoiding chemical cross-linkers. The mechanism of heat cross-linking
of EA is given in the Supporting Information (Figure S6).31 We presumed that the nanoparticles
of EA, being hydrophilic, will show faster release for short duration.
So, to control the rate of release and extend the duration of release,
it is desirable to blend the hydrophilic EA with a hydrophobic component.
Accordingly, a hydrophobic protein, Ze was chosen to blend with EA.
Further, to understand the release kinetics of the drug, the concentration
of Td was kept constant at 10% by weight of the total polymer (Table 1) and the blend composition
was manipulated by changing the ratios of EA and Ze. In our studies
one of the important aspects was to prepare non-aggregates of nanoparticles
with uniform size and distribution. Consequently, the particle size
analysis data showed the average particle size that ranged between
150 and 650 nm (Figure S5). The polydispersity
index ranged from 0.274 to 0.433, and the ζ potential of the
EA ranged from −18 to −25 mV, which increased with the
addition of Ze at a 1.0:1.0 ratio. However the ζ potential varied
from −21 to −23 mV with the addition of 10% Td to the
various compositions of nanoparticles of EA and Ze, which may be due
to the interactions between positive and negative charges of Td and
proteins, respectively (Table S1, Figure S4). The nanoparticles of EA and their blends with and without Td were
also examined by ESEM to confirm the particle size, shape, and distribution.
The micrographs of the nanoparticles of EA and the blends of EA and
Ze with and without drug were analyzed (Figure 1). The cross-linked nanoparticles of EA were
spherical in shape, and the average size ranged from 70 to 150 nm
in diameter (Figure 1C). The nanoparticles of EA and Ze at a ratio of 1.0:1.0 were also
spherical in shape, and the average size of the nanoparticles ranged
from 390 to 645 nm in diameter (Figure 1D). EA nanoparticles with 10% Td (w/w) recorded diameters
ranging from 309 to 575 nm (Figure 1E). Nanoparticles of the blends of EA and Ze with 10%
Td were prepared in various ratios (Table 1). The respective compositions with 10% Td
were designated as F, G, and H. The diameters of the nanoparticles
of all the different formulations ranged from 300 nm to 1.2 μm
in diameter. However, the blends with a 1.0:1.0 ratio showed nanoparticles
<500 nm in diameter. The decrease in diameter may be attributed
to the increased interactions of Td with EA and Ze (compositions F,
G, and H). These interactions were analyzed and confirmed by CD, fluorescence,
DSC, and XRD.

and without Td.

2.3 Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction
(XRD)
X-ray diffraction patterns of EA, Td, Ze, and various
nanoformulations
were analyzed (Figure 2). The studies were done to understand the changes in crystallinity
before and after the formation of nanoparticles. EA did not record
any sharp peak as it is amorphous in nature, whereas pure Ze recorded
a broad peak at 19° and two sharp peaks at 38 and 45° indicating
that it is semicrystalline in nature.18 The XRD pattern of Td showed numerous characteristic peaks, which
indicated that Td is crystalline in nature. The heat cross-linked
EA–Ze blend (D) showed crystalline peaks of Ze at 38 and 45°
with reduced intensities due to the functional interactions between
EA and Ze. The EA–Ze blend (G) with Td did not show characteristic
crystalline peaks of Td, indicating inclusion of Td in the blend and
was transformed from crystalline to amorphous due to homogeneous distribution
and strong functional interactions between the proteins and Td.32

Figure 2 XRD of EA, Ze Td, and different compositions of EA–
Ze nanoparticles
with and without Td.

2.4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermograms of EA, Ze, Td, and their blends were recorded (Figure S2). The thermogram of EA did not record
glass transition temperature, whereas Ze recorded Tg at 168 °C,33 which is
close to the reported Tg for Ze (170 °C).34 The thermogram of EA–Ze blends showed
a shift in the glass transition temperature (Tg) of Ze from 168 to 171 °C indicating functional and
hydrogen ion interactions between EA and Ze. The increase in Tg contributes to the increase in rigidity of
the nanoparticles as they were heat cross-linked. The melting temperature Tm for Td was recorded at 180 °C, which
disappeared after loading the drug in the blend composition indicating
that Td had lost crystallinity and became amorphous due to strong
interactions with the proteins in the EA–Ze blend. Also, this
was evident from the XRD studies. However there was an increase in Tg of Ze from 171 to 184 °C for the blend
composition with Td, which may be due to increased rigidity of the
nanoparticles as a result of strong interactions between proteins
and Td.

2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra of pure EA12 (A) showed
peaks at 3295 cm–1 due to −NH stretching
of the secondary amide, —C=O— stretching at 1652
cm–1 (amide I), −NH bending at 1538 cm–1 (amide II) , and a peak due to −CH stretching
at 2970 cm–1. A peak at 1403 cm–1 was observed due to plane wagging. The FTIR of cross-linked EA recorded
a new weak peak at 697 cm–1 due to disulfide (S–S)
bonds, which is attributed to cross-linking of sulfhydryl (−SH)
groups. FTIR of Td showed well-defined peaks that appeared at 3299
cm–1 for the −OH group, 2945 cm–1 for the =CH— of the aromatic ring, and 2843 cm–1 for the −CH– stretching. The rest of
the peaks of Td were 1595 cm–1 for the —C=C—
aromatic stretching, 1464 cm–1 for =C—H—
stretching, and 1261 cm–1 for C–O stretching.
The IR spectra of Ze (B) showed a peak at 3317 cm–1 due to −N–H stretching, a peak at 2963 cm–1 due to −CH stretching, and the respective peaks at 1664 and
1535 cm–1 due to N–H and out of plane deformation,
respectively. The IR spectra of the nanoparticles of EA–Ze
without Td showed a broad peak at 3308 cm–1 due
to merging of −OH and −NH of EA and Ze peaks. Similarly
the peaks between 2790 and 2930 cm–1of EA and Ze
were also merged. Also the characteristic amide I (—C=O)
and amide II peaks (−NH) at 1646 and 1519 cm–1, respectively, were merged, which appeared to be broad. The IR spectra
of the nanoparticles of EA–Ze blends with Td (G) showed broader
peaks, and the corresponding peaks like carbonyl, amine, and hydroxyl
groups of protein and Td were very close to each other. Also, we observed
some of the peaks disappeared or shifted to a lower or higher frequency.
The shifting of peaks indicated hydrogen ion interactions between
the protein and Td (for example, 3292 to 3302 cm–1, 2970 to 2932 cm–1, 1652 to 1659 cm–1, 1538 to 1532 cm–1) (Figure S3).

2.6 Drug Loading Efficiency,
Release Kinetics,
and Mechanism
The drug loading efficiency in the nanoparticles
was determined using eq 1, where 10 mg of un-cross-linked nanoparticles with Td was allowed
to dissolve in 10 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide for ∼12 h. The OD
(optical density) of the filtered solution containing the dissolved
drug was determined at 271 nm. The solution of nanoparticles without
Td was used as a reference, and the amount of drug loaded was estimated
by the calibration curve of Td. The studies showed that the loading
efficiency in all the compositions was about 70 μg mg–1 (Table S2). The λmax (271 nm) of Td before and after loading in the nanoparticles was
determined to be the same, which was confirmed from our Td release
studies. This indicated that Td was stable and active.

Td loaded
nanoparticles of various compositions were used for evaluating Td
release as a function of time (Table 1). As explained in the Materials and
Methods section, the release studies were done in phosphate
buffer of pH 7.4 at 37 °C. The release profiles for the compositions
of F, G, and H were analyzed. Ten percent (10%) of Td was loaded in
the respective compositions F, G, and H. Formulation F showed 18%
release within 10 h and 85% release within 48 h; likewise, the formulation
G showed 28% release within 10 h and 78% release within 48 h, and
the formulation H showed 18% release in 10 h and 77% release within
48 h. It was observed that the release of Td from the composition
did not follow any trend (Figure 3). Moreover ‘p’ values
for all the compositions are above 0.1; hence, we conclude that there
was no significant difference in the amount of Td released within
48 h.

Figure 3 Drug release studies for the compositions F, G, and H.

The drug release profiles of nanoformulations F,
G, and H were
assessed by zero order, first order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer–Peppas
models. These studies were done to understand the drug release kinetics
and mechanisms of different formulations. The drug release kinetics
and mechanisms for the respective nanoformulations (Table 1) were analyzed and recorded.
Based on the correlation coefficient (r2), the best fit for the experimental data of release studies was
determined. The resultant r2 values evaluated
by various models indicated that the mechanism of release was best
fit with zero order. Therefore, we confirmed that the release of Td
is independent of the concentration of Td present in the nanoformulations.
Further, the Korsmeyer–Peppas release exponent (n) is not uniform for all the formulations, where the formulation
F followed anomalous behavior or non-Fickian diffusion, because n is less than 0.5, indicating the rate of solvent diffusion
and polymer chain stretching are comparable.35 So the release of Td was dependent on diffusion of solvent and chain
stretching. Meanwhile, the other two formulations followed a Fickian
type of diffusion where n < 0.5, so it indicates
that the diffusion of solvent was slower than chain stretching due
to increased functional interactions between the drug molecules and
the polymer chains of the EA. In these formulations the interactions
of Td with EA increased with the increase in EA concentration (refer
to CD studies), which is due to the increased affinity of Td with
EA compared with Ze (Table S3).

2.7 CD Interaction Study
CD is popularly
being used for studying changes in the secondary structure of protein
when it gets exposed to various conditions. The CD spectra of the
respective proteins EA and Ze were recorded (Figure 4A,B). The CD spectra for both EA and Ze showed
two negative bands that fell between 208 and 222 nm, representing
the characteristic feature for the α helix of the protein. In
these studies we also observed that the intensities of the negative
bands were increased when Td concentration was increased in the EA
solution (Figure 4A).
Further, the Ze solution containing low concentration of Td did not
record any change in the intensity of the negative band of Td (60
μM). However, when Td concentration in the Ze solution was increased
to 120 and 180 μM, the negative band gradually increased. The
increase in the intensity of the negative band indicated a decrease
in α helix quantity due to the binding of Td with protein, which
is in accordance with the reported literature.36 From the above studies, we observed that the interactions
between EA and Td were more than those between Ze and Td. Therefore,
it may be considered that the partition coefficient of Td was more
towards EA than Ze.

(4B).

2.8 Fluorescence
Studies for Td Binding with Protein
The binding of drug with
protein can be studied by fluorescence
spectroscopy. Most of the drug molecules interact with the proteins
being multifunctional. CD and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques
are widely used for studying the binding interactions between drug
and proteins. Egg protein constitutes several proteins in various
percentages such as ovalbumin (54%), conalbumin (13%), ovomucoid (11%),
lysozyme (3.5%), globulins G2 and G3 (8%), and ovomucin (1.5%). The
interactions of Td with EA and Ze were analyzed using fluorescence
spectroscopy. The fluorescence spectra for the respective solutions
of EA and Ze containing Td at various concentrations were recorded
(Figure 5A,B). The
intrinsic tryptophan of the EA solution (100 μM) was excited
from 260 nm, and we observed an emission at 323 nm. The Fluorescence
quenching of EA was observed with the addition of Td, which indicated
interactions between EA and Td. Nevertheless, the extent of fluorescence
quenching remained unchanged with an increase in concentration of
Td (4 to 32 μM), because all the available charges (negative)
present in EA may have interacted with the positive charges of Td.
However, we noticed that the emission wavelength shifted from 323
nm to a lower wavelength, (blue shift, 321 nm), which is due to an
increase in hydrophobicity around the fluorophore moiety (for example,
tyrosine). The solution of Td alone showed an emission wavelength
at 297 nm, which is in accordance with the reported literature.37 Ze is a hydrophobic protein that is a combination
of several polypeptide chains of various molecular weights.38 In this protein the content of tryptophan is
very low and contains a high level of tyrosine. Hence tyrosine was
excited to obtain an emission maximum. Ze solution (100 μM)
showed an emission maximum at 305 nm, which in the presence of Td
at 4 μM concentration recorded appreciable quenching and observed
a shift in the wavelength from 305 to 292 nm (blue shift). However
with the increase in concentration of Td the quenching was not observed
(8 to 32 μM), rather the intensity of the emission wavelength
increased without any shift of the wavelength. This indicated that
positively charged Td interacts well with EA than Ze, which may be
attributed to the hydrophobic nature of Ze.

2.9 Hemolysis Activity
Hemolysis test
is one of the methods to show the in vitro biocompatibility of polymeric
materials using the RBCs isolated from blood. Ethical clearance was
obtained to conduct the hemolysis studies. Accordingly, we obtained
blood samples from the volunteers of NCL, Dispensary, Pune, MH, India.
As explained in the Materials and Methods section,
the negative (phosphate buffer of pH 7.4) and positive controls (deionized
water) and the respective compositions of D, E, and G were subjected
to the hemolysis test (Figure 6). The results showed 0.7% hemolysis activity for the negative
control (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), whereas the positive control (deionized
water) showed 90% hemolysis activity. The nanoparticles without Td
of composition D showed 1.20% hemolysis activity, the nanoparticles
with Td of composition E showed 0.92% hemolysis activity, and the
nanoparticles with Td of composition G recorded 1.09% hemolysis activity
(Figure 6A,B). According
to the reported literature the materials, which showed hemolysis activity
below 5%, are considered to be safe for drug delivery application
by the invasive method.39 From our studies
we observed that the nanoparticles of the compositions D, E, and G
with Td showed hemolytic activity less than 5%, and therefore, these
can be used for drug delivery application.

blood samples of compositions D, E, and
G (6A) and a profile of hemolysis of blood cells (6B).

2.10 MTT Assay
Cell
viability studies
were done using the MTT assay (Table S4). The cytotoxicity values were determined using cells of 3T3-L1
for various concentrations of individual test samples of pure EA (A),
pure Ze (B), heat cross-linked EA nanoparticles (C), and heat cross-linked
EA–Ze nanoparticles (D). EA and Ze are generally recognized
as safe polymers (GRAS). The nanoformulations were developed for invasive
application, so it is recommended that we demonstrate the cytotoxicity
for nanoformulations. The cytotoxicity with respect to various concentrations
was analyzed (Table S4). We observed that
every individual nanoformulation showed a decrease in cytotoxicity
as the sample concentration decreased. Generally, the cytotoxicity
values were between 6 and 25% for the formulations of concentrations
from 62.5 to 1000 μg mL–1. However, at a concentration
of 1000 μg mL–1, the maximum cytotoxicity
recorded for the respective nanoformulation samples (A, B, C, and
D) was about 25% (Figure 7). The relative cell viabilities of samples with respect to
the control were between 75 and 80%. This difference in cell viability
may be attributed to the presence of impurities (inseparable impurities
during the process of manufacturing the protein) in the pure protein
samples as they are not medical grade proteins. Such a type of result
was reported in an earlier cytotoxicity study.40 Thus, we can consider the developed nanoparticles of EA–Ze–Td
for drug delivery application.

(c), and EA–Ze
nanoparticles (D).

3 Conclusions
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic proteins (EA and Ze) were prepared
in different compositions to develop nanoparticles with and without
Td by the desolvation method. The size of these spherical nanoparticles
of EA–Ze with and without Td was dependent on the composition
of Ze and Td. The XRD, DSC, CD, and fluorescence spectra confirmed
the binding interactions between proteins and Td. As a result, the
crystalline Td became amorphous. Extended duration (48 to 50 h) of
Td release (70 to 80%) was achieved from all the compositions when
compared with the reported literature on Td release for 24 h. The
developed nanoformulations showed initial burst release. The release
mechanism of the Td as studied followed a zero order, where the rate
of Td release was constant as a function of time. From release kinetics,
we conclude that based on the ratios of Ze in the compositions, diffusion
of solvent and polymer chain stretching were different and therefore
the release exponent (n) was changed. Accordingly
the formulation F followed non-Fickian (>0.5) behavior, and G and
H formulations followed Fickian behavior (<0.5). The cell viability
studies showed an increase in cytotoxicity (2 to 25%) with the increase
in EA–Ze nanoparticle concentration (from 62.5 to 1000 μg
mL–1). At higher concentration, cytotoxicity was
more, which may be due to the presence of possible impurities in the
pure proteins. The hemolysis test ranged from 0.92 and 1.20% with
and without Td in EA–Ze blends, which indicated that they are
biocompatible and therefore may be considered for invasive drug delivery
application so as to improve the patient compliance.

4.1 Preparation of EA Nanoparticles
with and without
Td
EA nanoparticles were prepared using the desolvation method.
5% EA solution was prepared in distilled water (w/v). To this solution,
0.5 μL of Tween 80 was added and stirred overnight at 500 rpm.
Later, calculated amounts of Td were added to the protein solution
and continued stirring for further 2 to 4 h. To this solution while
stirring, a desolvating agent, acetone was added (double the volume
of protein solution) dropwise at a rate of 1 mL min–1. Physically cross-linked nanoparticles were prepared by subjecting
the solution at 50 °C for 4 h while stirring at 500 rpm. The
obtained EA nanoparticles were purified by two cycles of centrifugation
and redispersed in distilled water to remove the sol fraction. At
each centrifugation step, the EA nanoparticles were centrifuged at
15000 rpm for 30 min. After the centrifugation, the pellet of nanoparticles
was air-dried. A similar procedure was followed for the preparation
of nanoparticles without Td.

4.2 Preparation of Nanoparticles
of EA–Ze
Blends with and without Td
A similar procedure as described
in the above section was followed for the preparation of nanoparticles
of the EA–Ze blend. For example, 5% EA solution was prepared
in distilled water (w/v). To this solution, 0.5 μL of Tween
80 was added, and the solution of the EA mixture was allowed to stir
overnight at 500 rpm. To this mixture, while stirring, 5% Ze solution
dissolved in 90% ethanol was added dropwise at a rate of 1 mL min–1. After the addition, the solution mixture was desolvated
by dropwise addition of acetone at a rate of 1 mL min–1. The solution mixture of nanoparticles while stirring at 500 rpm
was cross-linked by subjecting the solution heating at 50 °C
for 4 h. The cross-linked nanoparticles were later purified by two
cycles of centrifugation and redispersed in distilled water to remove
the sol fraction. At each centrifugation step, the EA–Ze nanoparticles
were centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 30 min. After removal of sol fraction
the pellet was air-dried and used for further characterization. A
similar method was followed for the preparation of nanoparticles with
Td where an appropriate amount of Td was added to EA–Ze solution
and was allowed to stir for further 2 to 4 h, and later the same procedure
was followed as described in the above section.

The Td loading
efficiency in the nanoparticles was determined using eq 1: 1  

4.3 SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis
The molecular
weights of EA and Ze were determined by SDS-PAGE in a vertical electrophoresis
unit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The procedure was
based on the reported method with slight modifications.41 For instance, the sample was denatured by mixing
2 mg of Ze with 1 mL of loading buffer (2.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris HCl,
1 mM EDTA, 6% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue). This sample in the
buffer mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h with
occasional shaking and was centrifuged at 13000g for
10 min. Later, 10 μL of each sample was loaded into each well
of the gel. The stacking gel was 4% acrylamide, and the resolving
gel was 12% acrylamide. Electrophoresis was run at 25 mA per gel for
over 1.5 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained using Coomassie
brilliant blue. The molecular weights of the standard protein mixture
SDS 7 Sigma was used as a marker.

4.4 Environmental
Scanning Electron Microscopy
(ESEM)
ESEM (Micro Analysis System and Model Phoenix, Cambridge,
England, U.K.) was used for evaluating the morphology of the developed
nanoparticles. The samples for ESEM analysis were prepared by cutting
a small portion of silicon wafer on which the liquid samples of dispersed
nanoparticles were drop-cast and dried. Now the cut portion was carefully
mounted on the ESEM stub. The mounted stub was sputtered with gold
using an E5000 coating unit (Polaron Equipment Ltd., Watford, Hertfordshire,
England, U.K.). A dual beam, having an electron source of tungsten
filament (W) with emission at resolution of 20 kV in high vacuum,
was used for the studies.

4.5 Polydispersity Index and
ζ Potential
The polydispersity index and the surface
charge of the nanoparticles
were analyzed by a particle size analyzer (90 Plus Particle Size Analyzer,
Ver. 3.94, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, New York, USA). Three
milliliters of the sufficiently diluted nanoparticles in distilled
water was taken and sonicated for 3 min. The ζ potential of
the nanoparticles was measured at 25 °C with a scattering angle
of 90°. The polydispersity index was measured to understand the
level of homogeneity of particle size.

4.6 Wide
Angle X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Crystallinities of the powder
samples of polymers and their respective
nanoparticles were characterized using a Philips 1830 X-ray diffractometer
(Philips, Almelo, The Netherlands). X-rays were generated by a Cu
Kα source at a wavelength of 1.54 Å. The samples before
and after the formation of nanoparticles were scanned in the 2θ
range of 5–45° to investigate the changes in crystallinity.

4.7 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
Functional characterization of pure samples and blends of nanoparticles
such as EA, Ze, Td, and formulations of EA and Ze with and without
Td was performed using FTIR [PerkinElmer, Spectrometer I, FTIR diffused
reflectance (DRIFT) mode, USA]. The recording of the spectrum was
done in the wavelength range of 4000 to 500 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Each spectrum was
composed of an average of 12 scans. The respective sample preparation
was done by mixing 1–3 mg with ∼97 mg of potassium bromide
(KBr) and compressed (at 10 ton) to make a pellet, which was then
placed in the light path to record the spectrum.

4.8 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The thermal
properties of the pure polymers, blends of EA–Ze,
and Td were investigated by a differential scanning calorimeter (Model
Q10 DSC, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). Overall, 5–6
mg of each sample for analysis was taken in a DSC pan with the lid
and sealed it by applying pressure. The sample was equilibrated to
−90 °C for 2 min. In the first cycle, the sample was heated
to 200 °C at rate of 10 °C min–1. In the
second cycle, the sample was quenched to −80 °C at a rate
of 100 °C min–1. In the third cycle, the sample
was heated to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C min–1. These experiments were repeated twice for reproducibility.

4.9 Circular Dichroism (CD)
The CD studies
were done to investigate the effect of the secondary structures of
EA (100 μM) and Ze using various concentrations of Td (60, 120,
and180 μM). The CD measurements were carried out in the range
of 200–250 nm at 1 nm intervals, and CD spectra were collected
with a scan speed of 20 nm min–1. Each CD spectrum
was collected with an average of 10 scans.

4.10 Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
Fluorescence
measurements were performed using an LS50B spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer,
USA). The width of the respective excitation and the emission slits
were set at 0.625 nm. The individual solutions of EA with Td dissolved
in water and Ze with Td dissolved in 90% ethanol at a concentration
of 100 μM EA and Ze, respectively, were prepared, wherein the
concentration of Td was varied from 4 to 32 μM. The prepared
series of solutions were sonicated (Bio Technics, India) for 10 min,
and fluorescence measurements were performed. Fluorescence emission
spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 260 to 600 nm using
an excitation wavelength of 275 nm.

4.11 Cell
Line and Subculturing
Stock
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 IU mL–1), streptomycin
(100 μg mL–1), and amphotericin B (5 μg
mL–1) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C until confluent. The cells were dissociated with TPVG
solution (0.2% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, 0.05% glucose in PBS). The stock
cultures were grown in 25 cm2 culture flasks, and all the
experiments were carried out in 96 microtiter plates (Tarsons India
Pvt. Ltd., Kolkata, India).

4.12 Preparation of Test Samples
For
the cytotoxicity study, each test sample (polymers/nanoparticles)
was weighed, dissolved (polymers) or dispersed (nanoparticles) in
distilled DMSO (5%), diluted to the desired volume with DMEM supplemented
with 2% inactivated FBS to obtain a stock solution of 1 mg mL–1 concentration, and later sterilized by UV light.

4.13 Cell Viability Studies by MTT Assay
Cytotoxicity
studies for the respective test samples were done by
the MTT assay. The monolayer cell culture was trypsinized, and the
cell count was adjusted to 1.0 × 105 cells mL–1 using DMEM containing 10% FBS. To each well of the
96 well microtiter plate, 0.1 mL of the diluted cell suspension (approximately
10000 cells) was added. After 24 h, when a partial monolayer was formed,
the supernatant was flicked off, the monolayer was washed with the
medium, and 100 μL of different test concentrations of samples
was added to the partial monolayer in microtiter plates. The plates
were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 days under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The microscopic examination was carried out, and observations
were noted at an interval of every 24 h. After 72 h, the sample solutions
in the wells were discarded and 50 μL of MTT in PBS was added
to each well. The plates were gently shaken and incubated for 3 h
at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The supernatant
was removed, 100 μL of propanol was added, and the plates were
gently shaken to solubilize the formed formazan. The absorbance was
measured using a microplate reader at a wavelength of 540 nm. The
percentage of growth inhibition was calculated.

4.14 In Vitro Drug Release Study
The
drug release studies were done in phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 in a
thermostatically shaking water bath at 37 ± 0.5 °C. To quantify
the amount of drug released, the nanoparticles of the respective composition
were taken in a dialysis membrane of 1200 molecular weight cutoff
(Sigma-Aldrich D-9527) and dialyzed against phosphate buffer of pH
7.4. The sample of nanoparticles without drug was used as a reference.
To monitor release of Td, the sample was taken at a regular time interval
and the same amount of buffer was replaced. The estimation of the
drug was done using the calibration curve of Td. The amount of Td
released at each interval was calculated from the OD recorded for
each solution at 271 nm using a UV–visible double beam spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu UV–1601 PC, Japan). The release studies were monitored
up to 48 h in duplicate 2  where Mt is the amount of Td released at time t and M∞ is the total amount of
Td present in nanoparticles.

4.15 Evaluation
of Percent Hemolytic Activity
(HP)
Blood was obtained from human volunteers from National
Chemical Laboratory, Health Center, Pune, India, and the blood samples
were stabilized using EDTA. The red blood cells (RBCs) were isolated
from whole blood using density gradient centrifugation. Whole blood
of 5 mL was slowly added on top of 5 mL of PBS saline solution and
then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded,
and red blood cells were collected. Later, the RBCs were washed thrice
with phosphate buffer saline of pH 7.4 and centrifuged at 2000 rpm
for 30 min. A stock solution of RBCs was prepared without serum at
2% (v/v) using phosphate buffer of pH 7.4. Later, 2 mL of the diluted
RBC suspension was transferred to each of the 2 mL Eppendorf tubes
containing 10 mg of nanoparticles of composition D, nanoparticles
of composition E, and nanoparticles of composition G. The negative
and positive blood samples were prepared similarly without nanoparticles
in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and deionized water, respectively. The
respective Eppendorf tubes were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C.
During the process of incubation the nanoparticles along with RBCs
may settle and, therefore, at an interval of every 30 min, the tubes
were shaken gently to resuspend the samples and were centrifuged at
1500g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant
of PBS was then placed in another 96 well microtiter plate, and hemoglobin
(Hb) release was measured spectrophotometrically (OD 550 nm) at 541
nm using a microtiter plate reader (Tecan). The percentage of RBC
lysis was calculated based on the assumption that 100% RBC lysis resulted
in mixing blood with distilled water at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. Equation 3 was used for calculating
the percent (%) HP 3  where Dt is the absorbance of the test samples and Dpc and Dnc are the absorbances
of the positive and negative controls, respectively.
