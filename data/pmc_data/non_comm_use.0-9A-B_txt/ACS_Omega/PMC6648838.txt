Flavonoids provide
potential health benefits due to their antioxidant
properties. The antioxidant activity of natural flavonoids is primarily
exerted by phenolic hydroxyl groups; however, C–H bonds also
contribute to these properties. In this study, the contributions of
phenolic groups and C–H bonds to the antioxidant properties
of 13 flavonoids were investigated by using the (RO)B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
model chemistry in the gas phase and water and ethanol solvents. It
was found that the C–H bonds have lower bond dissociation energies
than O–H bonds in the 4-carbonyl and/or 3-hydroxyl group containing
flavonoids and hence define antioxidant activity. The HOO· radical scavenging of the selected flavonoids is also investigated
in detail through the potential energy surface, natural bond orbitals,
and kinetic calculations. It was found that the favored radical scavenging
mechanism of the flavonoids is hydrogen atom transfer, with the gas
phase rate constants in the range of 7.23 × 103–2.07
× 109 L·mol–1·s–1. The results suggest that the flavonoids, isomelacacidin, isoteracacidin,
melacacidin, and teracacidin, have antioxidant properties as high
as typical phenolic compounds such as quercetin, trans-resveratrol, trolox, and ascorbic acid.

1 Introduction
Flavonoids
are common phytochemicals recognized for their potential
health benefits. Up to now, more than 9000 flavonoids have been identified.1 Many studies demonstrated that flavonoids exhibit
a broad spectrum of biological activity, including vasodilating, anti-allergenic,
antiviral, and anti-inflammatory actions.2−4 The antioxidant
activity of flavonoids attracted the most interest: they can not only
scavenge free radicals but also reduce free radical formation. The Acacia and Populus genera were found to
be good sources of natural phenolic antioxidants.5 It was shown that the knotwood and bark extracts from waste
materials of these species display strong antioxidant properties due
to the high flavonoid content, including, for example, kaempferol,
dihydrokaempferol, dihydromyricetin, naringenin, pinobanksin, catechin,
taxifolin, melacacidin, teracacidin, isomelacacidin, isoteracacidin,
and keto-teracacidin.5−7

The chemical structure plays a fundamental
role in the antioxidant
activity of flavonoids. Previous studies suggested that the existence
of a certain hydroxylation pattern, particularly, in the ring B of
the flavonoid structure and/or a C2=C3 double bond in conjugation
with a C4-carbonyl group, methoxyl groups, and O3–H groups
increases antioxidant properties while the presence of saccharide
groups reduces antioxidant activity.2,3,8 However, it is very challenging to clearly link the
structural characteristics to the antioxidant activity. It is known
that flavonoids owe their radical scavenging activity to the presence
of phenolic hydroxyl groups, acting via the hydrogen atom transfer
(HAT) or the single electron transfer followed by proton transfer
(SETPT) mechanisms.9−12 Therefore, the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the O–H
moiety is a key factor in the comparison and the explanation of the
antioxidant properties. However, in some cases, it is difficult to
explain the empirically confirmed antioxidant properties of compounds
based solely on the lowest BDE(O–H) values. In the case of
dihydrokaempferol, the lowest BDE(O–H) and the trolox equivalent
antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values are 87.5 kcal·mol–1 and 1.39 mM, respectively, whereas the lowest BDE(O–H) of
kaempferol is 85.2 kcal·mol–1; however, the
antioxidant capacity of kaempferol is less than that of dihydrokaempferol
(the TEAC value of kaempferol was 1.34 mM).13,14 Moreover, the experimental vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity
(VCEAC) test of kaempferol and naringenin indicated that the latter
exhibits higher antioxidant activity (VCEAC = 135.1 mg/mL vs kaempferol
VCEAC = 114.6 mg/mL), but the lowest BDE(O–H) of naringenin
(88.0 kcal·mol–1) is higher than that of kaempferol
(85.2 kcal·mol–1).13,15 Recent studies in lignans highlighted that C–H (benzylic)
bonds can also play a fundamental role in antioxidant activity.16 Therefore, it is possible that contribution
from C–H bonds can explain the seemingly anomalous antioxidant
properties of flavonoids. This possibility has never been explored
before.

This study is aimed at evaluating the antioxidant properties
of
13 flavonoids (Figure 1) identified from the extracts of the Acacia and Populus genera. The compounds can be divided into four classes:
flavanones (compounds 5 and 7), flavonols
(compound 3), flavanols (compounds 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13),
and flavanonols (compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12).6 In this work, antioxidant activity is defined by the ability of
H-donation and/or electron transfer to the free radicals, an approach
that was validated before.17,18 The calculation of
thermodynamic parameters will be applied to study the antioxidant
properties of these compounds following three typical mechanisms:
HAT, SETPT, and the sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET).9,19 The potential energy surface (PES), kinetics, and natural bond orbitals
(NBOs) will be calculated for investigating the mechanism of reactions
of the most potential antioxidants with the hydroperoxyl radical (HOO·).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Hydrogen Atom Transfer
(HAT) Mechanism
The BDE value is a deciding factor in the
evaluation of the antioxidant
properties of compounds that follow the HAT mechanism.9,19 The B3LYP/3-21G level of theory was used first to calculate the
BDEs of all possible X–H (X = C, O) bonds in the flavonoids;
the results are presented in Table S1 (Supporting
Information). The lowest BDEs of X–H (X = C, O) were then recalculated
with higher accuracy at the ROB3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory in the gas phase as well as in two different solvents:
water and ethanol (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, although the O–H bonds have the lowest BDE values
in compounds 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 in a range of 77.0–85.4
kcal·mol–1, the lowest BDE values are for the
C–H bonds in flavonoids 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 in a range of 73.0–82.5 kcal·mol–1. The lowest BDE(C–H) (73.0 kcal·mol–1) belongs to the C3–H bond of the compound 1,
whereas the lowest BDE(O–H) is found at the position O7 of
the compound 9 (77.0 kcal·mol–1). In general, the lowest BDE(C–H) values are found at the
C3–H bonds of the flavanonols (compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12) and
at the C2–H bonds of the flavanones (compounds 5 and 7). The optimized geometries of the radicals at
the position C3 of compounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 suggest that the single
electron at the C3 atom is released to the O–C3–C4–O
system (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
Furthermore, the AIM analysis (Figure S2, Supporting Information) of the radicals formed by the dissociation
of C3–H bonds revealed that there are intermolecular bonds
between H atoms of the 3-hydroxyl group and O atoms of the 4-carbonyl
group; hence, the radicals are stabilized. By contrast, in flavanones,
the aromatic ring B is responsible for the electron delocalization
from the C2 atom of the radicals that is not found in the radicals
formed by the dissociation of the C3–H bonds (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The results also show
that the lowest BDE is found at the C–H bond only in the flavanone
and flavanonol families and never in the flavanols. Thus, the 4-carbonyl
and 3-hydroxyl groups have a determining effect on the BDEs of the
C–H bonds. Previous studies concluded that the presence of
4-carbonyl and/or 3-hydroxyl groups increases the antioxidant activity
of the flavonoids because the single electron at the O atom in the
ring A of radicals is released to these groups.2,14 However,
the optimized geometries of the radicals of 1–O7–H, 2–O7–H, 4–O7–H, 6–O7–H, and 12–O7–H
(Figure S1, Supporting Information) show
that there is no electron release from the O atom of the radicals
to the O atoms of the 4-carbonyl and 3-hydroxyl groups. Thus, the
results suggest that the increase in antioxidant activity of flavanonols
is due to the dissociation of the C3-H bond rather than O–H
bonds. On the basis of the calculated BDE values in the gas phase,
the H-donation ability of the C–H bonds of the studied compounds
follows the sequence 1 < 2 < 6 < 12 < 4 < 5 < 7. The highest H-donation ability of the O–H
bonds is observed at O7–H and/or O4′–H of the
compounds 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 with BDE(O–H) at ∼77–78
kcal·mol–1. It suggests that these compounds
may exhibit antioxidant activities as high as typical phenolic compounds
such as quercetin, trans-resveratrol, and vitamin
C (the lowest BDE(O–H) values: 75.2, 77.2, and 77.5 kcal·mol–1, respectively20,21). It was found that
the S configuration of the O4 position (compounds 9 and 10) can reduce the BDEs of O7–H
and C–H by 0.7–2.1 kcal·mol–1, compared with the R configuration (compounds 11 and 13). Thus, the isoflavandiols 9 and 10 must have higher antioxidant properties than
the isoflavandiols 11 and 13.

Following the gas phase
calculations, the BDE values were calculated
in ethanol and water solvents to investigate the effects of the dielectric
environment on the H-donating ability of the studied compounds.5,6,16,22 The results show that, in ethanol and water, the BDE(X–H,
X = O, C) values increase slightly in the range of 0.7 to 4.6 kcal·mol–1 apart from the compound 3 (O3–H)
that decreased in the polar solvents. The lowest BDE(C–H) values
of compounds 1 and 5 are lower than that
of the compound 3 in all of the studied environments
(Table 1). The results
explain the higher empirical antioxidant activity of compounds 1 and 5 compared with compound 3,13−15 despite the fact that the lowest BDE(O–H) values of the compound 3 (85.2, 84.2, and 83.3 kcal·mol–1 in
gas phase, water, and ethanol, respectively) are lower than those
of compounds 1 and 5 (86.5, 88.6, and 88.0
kcal·mol–1 and 87.6, 88.9, and 88.3 kcal·mol–1 in gas phase, water, and ethanol, respectively).
Therefore, the C–H bonds play a fundamental role in the antioxidant
activity of these compounds. However, similar to the gas phase, the
compound 9 has the lowest BDE(O–H) values in the
flavonoid family with 81.0 kcal·mol–1 in water
and 80.3 kcal·mol–1 in ethanol, whereas the
lowest BDE(C–H) values are observed at the C3–H bond
in the compound 1 with 75.5 and 75.2 kcal·mol–1 in water and ethanol, respectively. It is important
to note that in the solvent environments, the easiest bonds to dissociate
are still the C–H bonds in compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12. On the basis of these calculated values, compounds 1, 2, 9, and 12 are
the most powerful antioxidants.

2.2 Sequential
Electron Transfer Proton Transfer
(SETPT) Mechanism
The SETPT mechanism, which is characterized
by the ionization energy (IE) and the proton dissociation energy (PDE),
is also investigated to evaluate antioxidant properties of the studied
compounds and compare it to the order obtained based on the HAT mechanism.16,23,24 The first step (the sequential
electron transfer (SET)) plays a key role in the antioxidant activity
in the SETPT mechanism.9,25 Thus, the adiabatic IE values
were first calculated in gas and solution phases by using the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
method; results are presented in Table 2. The sequence of adiabatic IE values in the gas phase
is 3 < 9 < 8 < 10 < 11 < 13 < 4 ≈ 2 ≈ 12 < 1 < 5 < 6 < 7 (Table 2). The compound 3 has the lowest IE because the presence of the C2=C3 double
bond reduces ionization energy through electron delocalization from
the B ring. The number of O–H groups in the B ring also has
a significant influence on the ionization energy of the flavonoid
compounds. For example, in the case of flavanol, IE values decrease
in the order to 6 > 1 > 12 > 2 corresponding to an increase of the number of
OH groups.
In the water and ethanol solvents, the IE values decreased by approximately
50–60 kcal·mol–1 compared with those
for the gas phase (Table 2). This suggests that the studied compounds can lose an electron
much easier in the solute phase, for example, in water or ethanol,
than in the gas phase. However, the calculated IE values in the range
of 108.0 to 126.9 kcal·mol–1 are still higher
than the respective BDE values, making the SET mechanism less likely
to occur than the HAT mechanism. Consistently, the SET reactions between
the studied compounds and a typical radical (HOO·)
are endothermic with the (calculated) ΔH and
ΔG values in the ranges of 142.9–157.8
kcal·mol–1 in the gas phase and 35.5–48.5
and 38.6–51.6 kcal·mol–1 in the water
and ethanol solvents, respectively. Hence, the results suggest that
the SET mechanism is not favored in any of the studied environments.

13	172.6	117.8	112	147.7	147.6	39.4	39.3	42.6	42.4	
In general, the antioxidant mechanism follows the
HAT mechanism
if the ΔBDEs are approximately −10 kcal·mol–1 and the ΔIEs are higher than −36 kcal·mol–1 (compared with phenol: BDE(O–H) = 87.7 kcal·mol–1 and IE(adiabatic) = 193.8 kcal·mol–1 at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) model chemistry).17 For the studied compounds, the calculated ΔBDEs
and ΔIEs in the gas phase are in the ranges of −14.7
to −2.3 and −8.5 to −25.8 kcal·mol–1, respectively. Therefore, the HAT mechanism appears to be the main
radical scavenging pathway for the flavonoids.

2.3 Sequential
Proton Loss Electron Transfer (SPLET)
Mechanism
The potential for the SPLET mechanism was also
assessed; SPLET is defined by the proton affinity (PA) and the electron
transfer enthalpies (ETEs).26,27 As before, the B3LYP/3-21G
level of theory was first applied to calculate the PAs for all of
possible X–H (X = C, O) bonds (Table S2, Supporting Information); then, the lowest PAs of X–H (X
= C, O) were calculated using the (RO)B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
model chemistry. Results shown in Table 3 demonstrate that the PA values in the gas
phase of the C–H bonds (from 338.8 to 364.6 kcal·mol–1) are higher than those of O–H bonds (in the
range of 318.6–337.0 kcal·mol–1), whereas
ETEs of the C–H bonds are lower than those of O–H bonds.
Therefore, the C–H bonds are not favored in the first step
in the SPLET mechanism. With increasing the solvent polarization,
PA values decrease by 282.0–299.6 kcal·mol–1, whereas ETE values increase slightly by around 15.2–30.6
kcal·mol–1 (Table 3). This suggests that the deprotonation process
is more preferable than the single electron transfer process in the
strong dielectric environments. The thermochemical properties of the
first step of the SPLET reaction between the studied compounds and
HOO· radical are endothermic with positive ΔH and ΔG values in all studied media
(Table S3, Supporting Information). Thus,
the SPLET pathway is not favored for the flavonoids.

2.4 HAT Mechanism Reaction
of HOO· Radical
with the Selected Studied Compounds
2.4.1 Potential
Energy Surface (PES)
The comparison of the potential antioxidant
reaction mechanisms of
the studied flavonoids confirmed that the HAT mechanism is the main
pathway for their antioxidant activity. Thus, the reactions of compounds 1 and 9, characterized by the lowest BDE(X–H)
(X = C, O) values, with a HOO· radical were studied
to gain further insights into the antioxidant capacity of the flavonoids.
In this study, the (RO)B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) model
chemistry was used to calculate the energies of the reactants (R),
the transition states (TS), the intermediates (Int), and the products
(P). To ensure that there is a connection between each TS and its
reactant and product, the intrinsic coordinate calculations (IRCs)
were calculated and are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The PESs are displayed in Figure 2, and all optimized TS structures
are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information).

Figure 2 PES of
reaction between the selected compounds and HOO· radical.

Examination of the structures
of the TSs reveals that the H···OOH
and X···H (X = C, O) distances are in the ranges of
1.2612–1.9906 and 1.0989–1.3012 Å, respectively.
The X···H···O (X = C, O) angles are
in the range of 167.2–171.9° (Figure S4, Supporting Information). It is clear from Figure 2 that the energies of the studied
TSs are in the range of −2.1 to 6.8 kcal·mol–1. These data suggest that compounds 1 and 9 can easily transfer the hydrogens of the C–H groups or phenyl
hydroxyl groups to a HOO· radical to form H2O2 and an unreactive radical (ArX·). The
compound 9 is expected to have the highest antioxidant
activity because of the lowest energy of its transition states (−2.1
and −1.2 kcal·mol–1 for 9–O7–H–OOH and 9–O4′–H–OOH
TSs, respectively) in a good agreement with the conclusions of the
analysis presented above. On the basis of the calculated Gibbs free
energies (Figure 2),
these hydrogen abstraction reactions will be spontaneous apart from 1–O4′–H–OOH (ΔG = 1.6 kcal·mol–1). The hydrogen abstraction
reaction of 1–C3–H has a higher priority
than that of 1–O4′–H due to the
lower Gibbs free energies of the reactions of the C–H bond
(−13.2 kcal·mol–1) compared with the
O–H bond (+1.6 kcal·mol–1). Additionally,
the energy of the TS of 1–C3–H–OOH
(3.0 kcal·mol–1) is lower than that of 1–O4′–H–OOH (4.4 kcal·mol–1). As a result, the C3–H bond plays a deciding
factor in the radical scavenging activity of the compound 1.

2.4.2 Kinetic Study
For further insights
into the radical scavenging activity of the C–H and O–H
bonds of the selected flavonoids, calculations of the kinetics of
the reactions were also performed. The Gibbs free energy of activation
(ΔG≠) and rate constants
(k) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level
at 298.15 K for the gas phase reactions between compounds 1 and 9 with the HOO· radical, and are
presented in Table 4. To obtain realistic data, the correction for diffusion-controlled
rates was applied for the highest rate constant values, that is, for
the reaction of 9–O7–H and 9–O4′–H with HOO· radicals.25 The apparent rate constants (kapp) were calculated following the Collins–Kimball
theory in water at 298.15K;28 the steady-state
Smoluchowski29 rate constant (kD) for an irreversible bimolecular diffusion-controlled
reaction between compounds 1 or 9 with the
hydroperoxyl radical was 2.50 × 109 (or 2.60 ×
109 L·mol–1·s–1).

a Asterisk (*): the apparent rate
constants kapp.

As can be seen from the Table 4, the rate constants are in the range of
7.23 ×
103–2.07 × 109 L·mol–1·s–1. It is also worth noting
that the 1–C3–H + HOO· reaction
has a lower energy barrier and proceeds faster than 1–O4′–H (ΔG≠ = 9.6 kcal·mol–1, k = 3.13 × 107 L·mol–1·s–1 compared to ΔG≠ = 10.4 kcal·mol–1, k = 4.10 × 106 L·mol–1·s–1 for the 1–O4′–H
+ HOO· reaction). This result strongly affirms that
the C3–H bond decides the radical scavenging activity of the
compound 1 along with the O–H bonds. It was found
that the compound 9 has the highest rate constants with kapp = 2.07 × 109 and 1.72 ×
109 L·mol–1·s–1 for the 9–O7–H + HOO· and 9–O4′–H + HOO· reactions, respectively. These reactions are much faster than the
HOO· radical scavenging of trolox or ascorbic acid
(kTrolox= 5.30 ×
105 L·mol–1·s–1, kAsc = 2.65 × 105 L·mol–1·s–1).26,30 To validate these results, the M05-2X/6-311G(d,p) level of theory
was applied to calculate the kinetics of the reactions in the gas
phase. The results are shown in Table S6 (Supporting Information). It is apparent that the order of the HOO· radical scavenging capacity at the M05-2X/6–311G(d,p)
level reproduces the trend predicted by the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) method,
with the known difference of higher rate constants in the B3LYP method
compared to the M05-2X method. The highest rate constant was observed
for the 9–O7–H + HOO· reaction
at k = 1.75 × 107 L·mol–1·s–1. This result again suggests
that the compound 9 is the most powerful antioxidant.

2.4.3 Natural Bond Orbital (NBO)
NBO
analysis was also applied to the antioxidant mechanism of compounds 1 and 9.(16,31) In this approach, singly
occupied molecular orbitals (SOMO) and atomic spin densities (ASDs)
of the TSs of the studied compounds were determined; the results are
presented in Table 5 and Figure 3. In
case of TSs of 1–C3–H–OOH and 9–C4–H–OOH, the three electron lone pairs
on the O1 atom, LP(1,2,3)O1, are donated to the antibonding orbital
on the H·, LP*(1)H, with stabilization energies (E(2)) of 160.9 and 152.0 kcal·mol–1, respectively. Moreover, the interaction between two unoccupied
orbitals on C3/C4, LP*(1)C3/C4, and on the H atom, LP*(1)H, leads
to form a new O1–H bond on H2O2 with E(2) values at 324.1 and 346.0 kcal·mol–1, respectively. Notice that the stabilization energy values for LP(3)O1
to σ*(1)X–H, which were found in the transition states
of 1–C3–H–OOH and 9–C4–H–OOH (54.3 and 49.8 kcal·mol–1, respectively (Table 5)), are not observed for the TSs of 1–O4′–H–OOH, 9–O7–H–OOH, and 9–O4′–H–OOH.
In the 1–O4′–H–OOH, 9–O7–H–OOH, and 9–O4′–H–OOH
TSs, the high stabilization energy is found for the donor LP(3)O1
and the acceptor LP*(1)H (X–H) at 114.1, 76.7, and 86.9 kcal·mol–1, respectively, and for the donor LP(3)O(O–H)
and the acceptor LP*(1)H (O–H) at 118.3, 154.8, and 154.2 kcal·mol–1, respectively (Table 5). It is worth noticing that in the TSs of 1–C3–H–OOH and 9–C4–H–OOH,
the significant atomic orbital density is oriented along the O1···H···X
(X = C, O) transition vector while that was not observed in the TSs
of 1–O4′–H–OOH, 9–O7–H–OOH, and 9–O4′–H–OOH
(SOMO, Figure 3). Instead,
the atomic orbital densities of 1–O4′–H–OOH, 9–O7–H–OOH, and 9–O4′–H–OOH
TSs are distributed on both sides of the transition vector and are
close to being planar. These results also again support for the HAT
mechanism of the radical scavenging of the X–H bonds.32,33

It should be noted that in
aqueous solutions, phenolic compounds
are involved in acid–base equilibria. The anionic species have
been implicated before in radical scavenging activity, and they may
have higher activities than the neutral species.25 Therefore, the results shown here may underestimate the
activity of some of the compounds, further emphasizing the high potential
of flavonoids as therapeutic antioxidants.

3 Conclusions
The antioxidant activity of 13 natural phenolic
compounds of the
flavonoid family was evaluated by using the (RO)B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p)//B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
model chemistry in the gas phase and two typical solvents: water and
ethanol. It was found that the C–H bonds (C3–H of the
flavonoid backbone structures) play a fundamental role in antioxidant
properties of flavonoids containing 4-carbonyl and/or 3-hydroxyl groups.
These groups release the single electron on the C3 radical (the C3–H
bond) into the O–C3–C4–O system and form intermolecular
bonds to stabilize the radicals, yielding reduced BDE(C3–H)
and increased antioxidant activity of the flavonoids. Among the studied
compounds, keto-teracacidin 4, isomelacacidin 9, isoteracacidin 10, melacacidin 11, and
teracacidin 13 were theoretically evaluated for antioxidant
activity for the first time. The results show that these compounds
may have antioxidant properties as high as typical phenolic compounds
such as quercetin, trans-resveratrol, trolox, and
ascorbic acid, particularly in isomelacacidin 9. The
analysis of PES and kinetics on the reactions of the lowest BDE(X–H)
(X = C, O) compounds with the typical HOO· radical
shows that the HAT mechanism is the main pathway for antioxidant activity
of the flavonoids, with the rate constants in the gas phase are in
the range of 7.23 × 103–2.07 × 109 L·mol–1·s–1.

4 Computational Methods
The thermochemical
properties of the compounds were obtained following
methodologies well established in the literature16,34 by using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.35 All of the compounds and related radicals, cationic radicals, anions,
transition states, intermediates, and products were optimized, and
their vibrational frequencies were determined at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level of theory.31,34 The single point electronic energies
were then calculated by the ROB3LYP/6-311++G(2df,2p) method.9,36 The lowest electronic energy conformer that contains possible intermolecular
hydrogen bonds were used for further analysis.16,37−39 The integral equation formalism of the polarizable
continuum model (IEF-PCM) was used to treat implicitly the solvents
at the same level of theory as in the gas phase.40,41 The antioxidant mechanisms were investigated following the previously
described methods.9,16,19 The reaction enthalpies of the individual steps in the above described
mechanisms of antioxidant activity in the gas phase (at 298.15 K and
1 atm) were also calculated according to the literature.19,42,43

In the gas phase, the enthalpy
of the hydrogen atom was −0.5
hartree and for other environments, the enthalpy of the hydrogen atom
was calculated by the same method. The (calculated) enthalpies of
the electron (e–) and proton (H+) were
taken from the literature.19,44−46 Vibrational frequencies obtained at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level
were scaled by a factor of 0.9669.47,48

The
rate constant (k) was calculated in the gas
phase by using the conventional transition state theory (TST) as49−51  where kB and h are the
Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively,
—G≠ is the Gibbs free energy
of activation of the studied reaction, σ is the reaction symmetry
number that represents reaction path degeneracy, the number of possible
difference but equivalent reaction pathways, and κ accounts
for tunneling corrections that were calculated using the Eckart barrier.52 Kinetics were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level using the Eyringpy program.25,53,54

Atom-in-molecule (AIM) analysis55 was
performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level by using AIM2000 software.56
