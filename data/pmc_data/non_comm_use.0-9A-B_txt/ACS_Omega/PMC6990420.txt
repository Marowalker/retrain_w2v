Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a toroidal/coiled
geometry-shaped
structure sustain innovative preference to future technology material.
The toroidal shape can be used in designing nanoelectronic devices
for various prospective applications such as tactile sensors, electromagnetic
absorbers, and energy storage devices. In this study, we demonstrate
the fabrication of toroidal geometry shapes of metallic (m-) and semiconducting
(s-) SWNTs, which can be revealed by simply mixing a few solutions
in the correct ratio, both oil-in-water (hydrophobic) and water-in-oil
(hydrophilic) emulsion processes. Herein, the letter communicates
the formation of pure m- and s-SWNTs (metallic and semiconducting)
by annular, obtained from gel column chromatography, via the emulsion
approach. We have also studied the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate
removal of sorted species from a gel column by a simple method named
as chloroform/methanol/water extraction.

Introduction
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
and their extraordinary
properties can be deemed a tremendous milestone for nanomaterials
and nanotechnology.1,2 Numerous researches have been
conducted to find the potential applications of SWNTs in various fields
such as nanomedicines, energy storage devices, textiles, sensors,
and so on.3−5 Actually, the extraordinary properties of SWNTs are
also extensively associated with their geometric structure, that is,
hexagonal and nonhexagonal networks.6 Diverse
forms of SWNTs including straight, branched, tori, and coiled have
been considered and possess exclusive properties for prominent innovations.7−9 Among the different geometric shapes of SWNTs, coil/tori-shaped
SWNTs drag massive attention because of their significant properties
such as persistent current (Ipc), magnetic
response, high mechanical strength, superelasticity, and conducting
behavior.10,11 In 1994, toroidal carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
were observed experimentally at 700 °C over silica-endorsed carbon
monoxide (CO) catalyst by the catalytic decomposition of acetylene.12−14 The tori geometry structure attained significant attention, and
several approaches (catalyst, gas atmosphere, and temperature) have
followed to synthesize the tori/coil CNTs.15−17

Many
studies have been conducted to investigate the structural
models of tori CNTs to investigate their thermodynamic stabilities.
The work of Ihara et al. showed that the tori CNTs are found to be
more stable than the C60 fullerene, comparing the cohesive
energies.11,18−20 Additionally, many numerical
simulations have demonstrated that the toroidal SWNTs (TSNs) exhibit
quantum interference effect in charge transport under an external
magnetic field or electromagnetic field, along their potential use
as a macroscopic molecular toroid/coil with the molecular Aharonov–Bohm
oscillator, spin-polarized current injector, detection of biopolymers,
and metal–insulator transition switching.21−23 Recently, gold
nanoparticles (Au NPs) were deposited on CNT rings for theragnostic
applications.24 Nevertheless, the experimental
studies and applications of TSNs have been dilatory as the theoretical
investigations.25 Continuous exploration
is made on the toroid closure, such as via self-organized coiling,
covalent ring-closure reaction, templating in polymer shell, and oil-in-water
and water-in-oil emulsions.26,27

However, the
toroid structures of SWNTs were previously fabricated
by gas phase or liquid suspension techniques. The adjustment and variation
in parameters (gas and temperature) can be tailored to manage in controlling
the structure of toroidal CNTs. In 1996, Kaneto et al. and Shen et
al. worked on the electrical conductivity of single-carbon microcoils
at room temperature.28,29 Recently, Chiu et al. worked
on the high conductivity of tori-shaped CNTs at low temperature.30 In addition, numerous studies have also been
conducted to explore the electronic properties of the tori CNTs. The
work of Akagi et al. demonstrated the calculation of the band structure
and electronic density of tori CNTs that would be metallic (m-), semiconducting
(s-), or semimetallic, depending on the arrangement of pentagons and
heptagons.31 The zigzag toroidal carbon
nanowire (TCNW) with m-TSN, the Ipc in
the primary carbon ring are concealed by those in resultant TCNW;
TCNW with s-TSN, Ipc exhibits the same
response as that in their primary carbon rings.22,32−35 Thus far, coil/tori CNTs can be formed by the mixture of s-SWNTs
and m-SWNTs that are firmly packed in small bundles.36 Notably, to manifest and harvest the superiority of a TSN,
especially its unique quantum interface and spin transport characteristic,
it must constitute either m-SWNTs or s-SWNTs purely, as proposed in
the numerical simulation.37 To the best
of our knowledge, we can find the fabrication of s-SWNTs or m-SWNTs
by structural simulation, but there is no effort on the synthesis
of toroidal s-SWNTs or m-SWNTs experimentally.

In this study,
we report a fabrication method of pure m- and s-SWNTs
into a coil/tori geometry shape by an emulsion process, as shown in Figure 1. First, there are
several wet approaches for the solution phase separation of m- and
s-SWNTs, such as electrophoresis, density gradient ultracentrifugation
(DUG), polymer wrapping extraction, and gel column chromatography.
Gel column chromatography has the advantages of scalable throughput
with highly pure m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs, where more than 20 isolated
chiralities have been sorted out.38−40 Ideally, it can provide
a range of specific chiralities for SWNT fabrication that would allow
comprehensive studies of charge transport of SWNTs under an external
field. The bending of SWNTs into a coil or tori closure can be achieved
via sonication, covalent ring closure, templating in a polymer shell,
colloidal mask, emulsion, and by incorporating pentagons and heptagons
into the hexagonal network.7,41−43 Notably, we demonstrate the fabrication of m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs from
annular high-pure s-SWNTs and m-SWNTs, obtained from gel column chromatography,
via the emulsion process. We are particularly interested in considering
the compatibility of the emulsion with the gel column chromatography,
scalability, controllable tori radii, and minimal surface modification.44 Second, the sorted species showed hydrophilic
behavior because of the coverage of SDS, an anion surfactant that
used to disperse the nanotubes and control the interaction with gel
beads during the sorting process. Apparently, the removal of SDS is
critical to induce the formation of the tori structure. SDS acted
as a spacer, blocking the van der Waals interaction and Π–Π
stacking that stabilized the tori structure when the SWNT bundle was
forced to coil into a tori in the emulsion droplet.45 Hence, it is critical to remove the SDS surfactant. SDS
can be merely removed from SWNTs by alcohol washing, filtration, and
chloroform/methanol/water (C/M/W) extraction. In this experiment,
C/M/W extraction was applied to remove the SDS coating. Consequently,
the sorted metallic and semiconducting nanotubes were successfully
coiled into a tori topology with a diameter of ∼150–200
nm. Of note, it remains a challenge to develop the coiling and uncoiling
of SWNT tori into a reversible process.41 Till now, there are only limited works performed to refine the geometry
shape of nanostructured m- and s-SWNT tori.

semiconducting SWNTs; the separation is performed by the selective
adsorption of semiconducting CNTs onto agarose gel beads, whereas

CNTs went through the gel column. (b) Dimethylformamide (DMF)-covered
SWNTs and m- and s-SWNTs formed by water-in-toluene emulsion and toroidal

Results and Discussion
By Liu et al., numerous methods
have been presented for the fabrication
of novel nanotori from the Marangoni effect, hole nucleation mechanism,
two-dimensional gas bubbles, and breath figures method. Huang and
co-workers experienced the rapid evaporation of mixed droplets to
compress the dissolved graphene oxide sheets into warp/bend spheres.
The nanostructures were initially confined by the polymer shells and
droplets. Then, they compressed when the droplets changed in shape
or shrunk in volume. Thus, in this process, collapsing generates shock
waves that exert force to bend the CNT bundles. In the shape formation
of the nanostructure, interfaces played a significant role.46,47 The interfaces are either the polymer–solution interface,
the solution–air interface, or the interface between different
densities.48,49 Notably, the general interaction
between the emulsion droplets and nanofilm is focused in this study.
The oil droplets (nonpolar) should be first solubilized and the oil-carrying
solvent should be miscible with water. The common solvents can be
either DMF or N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP). In addition,
mixing DMF and water without oil did not show any bending; too much
quantity of oil also did not work. Thus, this present system gives
us unexpected outcomes without using polymers and emulsifiers. The
results confirmed that rings formed inside the suspended oil droplets
before the polymer.50

Furthermore,
the diameter of the rings can be controlled by the
droplet size. The droplets serve as templates for coiling. When the
droplet size is sufficiently small, it can exert significant force
on the entrapped nanostructures, causing their deformation. However,
if the droplet is either too small, it cannot coil into a ring, or
if too large, it folds or twists, forming loose/curled or 8-shaped
rings. Notably, the droplet size can be controlled by varying the
ratio of oil with DMF [toluene/DMF or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB)/DMF].
We suspect that bath sonication also has a great influence on the
droplet size.41

In this study, the
tori morphology was formed by an emulsion process.
The emulsion process is simply performed with water, NMP/DMF, and
toluene/DCB. Generally, SWNTs interact with the nonpolar soluble oil,
and the oil-carrying solvent should be miscible with water. During
the coiling process, toluene plays an essential role in the tori/coil
structure of SWNTs. The stability of the emulsion system is strongly
dependent on the size of particles and the interfacial energy of the
oil-in-water and water-in-oil interfaces. Competition occurs between
the elastic energy trying to maintain the straight SWNT shape and
the interfacial energy to keep a curved water-in-oil interface. Herein,
we coiled the SWNT bundles into tori at a large scale in an oil-in-water
emulsion process. SWNTs can be coiled into tori in the presence of
a surfactant, and it is also well known as the “solvent-shifting”
method, both in oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions. Without the
need of polymer encapsulation, the method is now simpler and more
scalable. The hydrophobic SWNTs were coiled into tori with their diameter
ranging from ∼90 to 100 nm. The formation of tori is due to
the bending of SWNT bundles at the oil-in-water interface. The procedure
of the formation of SWNT tori is clearly shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Successful coiling of
hydrophobic SWNTs into TSNs via the oil-in-water
emulsion (a) and schematics illustrating the coiling process of a
ring (b–h). TEM images of TSNs obtained by the emulsion method,
mixed rings, and uncoiled CNT at scale bars of 50 nm,0.2 μm,
20 nm, and 0.5 μm. More than 80% SWNT rings (diameter 90–120
nm) were obtained by using an emulsion.

TSN were formed by following oil-in-water emulsion
interface Figure 2a.
SWNTs were dispersed
in DMF through tip ultrasonication, resulting in a dark suspension.
At this point, the SWNTs were in the form of bundles, and then a small
amount of oil was added in the surfactant. In addition, water was
injected in a single shot and the surfactant turned cloudy. After
this, the final solution was isolated by centrifugation. As shown
by TEM (Figure 2b),
the SWNTs were in the form of parallel bundles, and there was no self-coiling
of the SWNT bundles. Thus, the structural variety of the coil/tori
was observed (Figure 2c–h), such as 0-shaped, racket-shaped, and 8-shaped tori geometry
shapes. The resultant coil/tori were stable and did not uncoil after
being dispersed in either oil or water because of the Π–Π
stacking among the SWNTs.

We have investigated the formation
of mixed species of SWNT tori
via the emulsion process. Several parameters were studied comprehensively
to obtain a controllable tori/coil size and yield, as to build a solid
foundation for m- and s-SWNT tori formation. Next, we moved on to
the m- and s-SWNT tori formation via the emulsion process. Before
performing tori synthesis, we carried out the sorting of metallic
and semiconducting species. The sorting of SWNTs by their electronic
and atomic structures in liquid phase is of paramount importance for
the use and application of SWNTs. Several separation methods are introduced,
such as polymer extraction, ion-exchange chromatography, aqueous two-phase
extraction, gel chromatography, DUG, and DNA wrapping chromatography.
Most recently, innovative metallic and semiconducting separation is
done using gel column chromatography. Gel column chromatography offers
simple, high-throughput, and high-purity m- and s-SWNTs at an affordable
cost and short time span. Moreover, gel column chromatography has
hitherto been progressively pioneering in species sorting and very
promising, and it has effectively sorted out more than 20 isolated
species of high purity and several optical isomers from SWNTs. Thus,
gel column chromatography is a suitable approach for m- and s-SWNT
sorting for tori/coil synthesis.

We carried out gel column chromatography
as reported by Tanake
et al. by using dextran exclusion gel (sephacryl-200) beads as the
gel medium. SWNTs were dispersed in 1% SDS surfactant and flowed through
the gel column.51 The unbound fraction
was collected as the metallic species. The extraction of the semiconducting
species from the gel column was performed by flushing with 5% SDS.
The different chiralities in the semiconducting species have different
affinities to the gel beads. As the result, a weaker affinity was
obtained at the lower level of the gel column, whereas a higher affinity
was bound to the higher level of the gel column. The affinity difference
also realized the extraction of single-chirality (enriched) SWNTs.
The different colors of the obtained semiconducting species indicated
the enrichment in certain chiralities. Thus, the purity of metallic
and semiconducting species is high.

As the result, the metallic
species were bound to the gel beads,
thereby allowing the extraction of metallic and semiconducting species.

The absorption peaks for HiPco SWNTs were around 300–450,
650–950, and 950–1350 nm, which correlated to the third,
second, and first optical transitions of the semiconducting species,
and were designated as S33, S22, and S11, respectively. The absorbance peak of 450–650 nm is the first
optical transition of metallic species and designated as M11. As compared with the unsorted SWNTs (before separation), the enrichment
of the semiconducting SWNTs was clearly observed in the rinsed portion
(blue spectrum) and the metallic SWNTs were clearly concentrated in
the M11 region (red spectrum). From the UV–vis spectra
(Figure 3a), it is
observed that the SWNTs have broad absorption in the S22, S11, and M11 regions because they contain
two-thirds of semiconductors and one-third of metals. For s-SWNTs,
the S22 and S11 bands are significantly stronger/sharper
in the absence of the metallic band. In contrast, m-SWNTs show significant
enhancement in the M11 band in the absence of the S22 and S11 bands. For s-SWNTs, the absence of the
M11 peak indicates that they are highly enriched with semiconducting
SWNTs, the condition which is the same for m-SWNTs in the M11 region. Figure 3a
clearly evidences the enrichment in the semiconducting and metallic
species. For semiconducting SWNTs, the S22 and S11 bands are significantly stronger. In contrast, metallic SWNTs show
significant enhancement in the M11 band in the absence
of the S22 and S11 bands.

red and blue spectra are the metallic and semiconducting CNTs after
the separation. The black spectrum is from the SWNT dispersion before
separation. (b) FTIR spectra for SDS removal. (c) UV–vis spectra
of s-SWNTs (SDS), s-SWNTs (DMF), and s-TSN (DMF) (d) Raman spectra
of m- and s-SWNTs after SDS removal.

By careful investigation of the UV–vis spectra
and Raman
spectra, we found that s-SWNTs and s-TCNs are different in patterns
(Figure 3c). From the
UV–vis spectra, it is observed that the intensity of s-TSN
peaks in the region of S11 highly enhances and sharpens.
In comparing the radial breathing mode (RBM) of s-TCN to s-SWNTs,
we observed a slight red shift under 532 nm excitation, whereas a
single RBM peak had been intensively increased.

As we discussed
above, the properties of SWNTs are strongly dependent
on their geometric structures and are explained by the chiral index
(n1, n2).
Hence, in tiny SWNT cylinders, two-thirds are semiconductors and one-third
are metals.52 Today, many SWNT-based applications
need only one or a specific type of tube such as a semiconducting
tube for transistors. Thus, the SWNT chiral index is the current focus
of the researcher. In principle, to measure the chiral index and properties
of the SWNTs, we performed photoluminescence, and Raman scattering
was performed to identify the metallic and semiconducting SWNTs.53 Hence, it is important to know even a small
change in the tube’s environment. Raman scattering of the RBM
will be changed by different surfactants which create variations in
the RBM intensity. The surfactant creates a minor influence on frequency
(diameter) and the excitation energy axes. The interaction between
the nanotubes and the surrounding environment-related effects can
affect the RBM frequency.54

To examine
the surfactant-based changes in the Raman spectra, we
measured the sorted m- and s-SWNTs by using 532 and 785 nm laser excitations.55,56 We identified the left and right RBM intensities as that of m-SWNTs
and s-SWNTs between 150 and 350 meV. In the region of s-SWNTs, we
identify several branches of excitation energy, and the peaks (11,1),
(10,0), and (9,1) lie at ωRBM 256.0, 291.4, and 306.2, respectively.
m-SWNTs are mostly in the region of (15,0); so, the peaks (7,7) and
(13,0) lie at ωRBM 247.8 and 230.8, respectively. Hence, it
is clearly indicated that m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs in aqueous solution
are wrapped with SDS, as shown in Figure 4.38

Figure 4 RBM Raman spectra
of sorted m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs at (a) 532 and
(b) 785 nm excitations. The red and blue spectra are the metallic
and semiconducting segments, respectively.

The next step toward the formation of TSN is to
coil the sorted
m- or s-SWNT fraction into the topology of toroid by following the
emulsion procedures as shown by Wang et al. and Chen et al.44,57 The tori formation originates from the liquid/liquid interface-induced
SWNT bending. The tori are stabilized by van der Waals interaction
and Π–Π stacking. We found that in the presence
of surfactants, neither water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion nor oil-in-water
(o/w) emulsion has led to the formation of TSNs. We elucidate that
surfactants act as spacers that screen or block the tori from stabilizing
by the van der Waals interaction and Π–Π stacking.
Lukaszczuk et al. have proposed a surfactant-free post-treatment that
is highly compatible to gel column chromatography.58 The sorted fraction is introduced to HCl to convert the
sodium salt to deoxycholic acid, followed by hot ethanol washing to
dissolve the deoxycholic acid that covers the nanotube surface. We
are curious and interested in searching for an alternative approach.
Again, SDS has been widely used for protein solubilization and separation
of protein by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. C/M/W extraction
was reported as an effective manner for SDS removal from protein.59,160 This method was first reported by Wessel and Flügge.161,60 We modified the method to suit our case.60 A 2 mL of solvent containing sorted SWNTs was mixed with 8 mL of
methanol. Next, 2 mL of chloroform and 6 mL of water were added for
phase separation. The C/M/W ratio was 1:4:3 by volume. The mixture
was vortexed and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The nanotubes
were localized at the interphase. Hence, the upper supernatant was
removed carefully. Subsequently, 6 mL of methanol was added to the
lower chloroform phase and centrifuged again for 10 min at 10 000
rpm. The upper supernatant was removed.

In determining the organic
solvent precipitation for the effective
removal of SDS, we carried out C/M/W extraction and acetone extraction.
Dialysis against water has also been carried out for reference purpose.
From the FTIR spectra in Figure 3b, it is observed that both C/M/W and acetone extractions
are effective in SDS removal. However, we found that only the species
sorted by C/M/W extraction could be coiled into tori. Before this,
we have studied the synthesis of m- and s-TSNs and their properties
(magnetic and optical) by simulation. We have succeeded in m-TSN and
s-TSN fabrication with the additional step of surfactant removal.
Thus, the major difference in our approaches is that nanofilaments
are included by the process (emulsion) and transformed in shape. The
FTIR spectra revealed that the surfactants are fairly removed but
at the cost of introduction of carboxylic groups (1640 cm–1) during acid hydrolysis (Figure 3d). We have tried other surfactant removal protocols,
such as acetone washing, dialysis, C/M/W extraction, and acid hydrolysis
with ethanol washing, but only the latter two methods have led to
the formation of TSNs.

The TSNs are constituted of a few to
tens of nanotubes that bundle
together and form a torus. The walls of nanotubes are clearly observed
under a higher magnification. The significant difference between the
m- and s-TSN and SWNT tori was the circumference of the SWNT tori
which was knowingly longer. Possibly, we can say that SWNT bundles
were longer and flexurally strong. Therefore, numerous factors could
be involved in the formation of the tori structure, such as the length
of SWNT bundles before formation, the bundled amount of SWNTs, and
the wobbling interaction between the complex and dynamic SWNT tori,
and contract polymers during the coiling procedure.

The TEM
images (Figure 5a–h
revealed that the m-SWNTs and s-SWNTs are coiled
into tori topology (“O-shaped”) with the diameter of
∼150–200 nm. Semiconducting TSNs exhibit diamagnetism
at a small magnetic flux, which is in great contrast with the paramagnetism
of metallic TSNs. An applied magnetic flux is known to induce tori
current in molecules and persistent current in mesoscopic tori. The
physical origin of persistent current is the cyclic boundary condition
of the electronic system. The electronics structure calculated from
the tight-binding model could be divided into these following types:
a metallic, a narrow-gap semiconducting (Eg < 1 meV), and a wide-gap semiconducting (Eg > 1 eV). When TSN are threaded by a uniform perpendicular
magnetic field, the persistent currents only exist in metallic and
a narrow-gap semiconducting TSNs.34,61

Figure 5 (a–d)
After the effective removal of SDS from nanotubes
by C/M/W washing, TEM images of the resulting m-TSN obtained by the
simple emulsion method (oil-in-water) in DMF with high-power ultrasonication.
(e–h) TEM images of the s-TSN obtained by toluene in water
emulsion successfully coiled into a ring topology with a diameter
of ∼150–200 nm. The bundles of nanotubes forming nanotori
contained several to tens of individual nanotubes. The larger diameter
of rings up to 200 nm is due to the DMF/toluene ratio.

Toluene played an important part in the coiling
process; so, in
both experiments (hydrophobic and hydrophilic), toluene was used.
Coil/tori were formed in both cases. Theoretical studies revealed
that the dependence of the electronic structure of TSN wires/bundles
is based on the number of particles, which has been changed by the
outer TSN coating and differs from the particles of inner SWNT tori.

It is well known that the wave nature manifests itself only when
the device size is comparable to the wavelength and the absence of
inelastic scattering. Therefore, the observation of quantum interference
phenomenon in the mesoscopic structure, in particular TSNs which show
all the spin and charge transport features of graphene coil because
of the additional degree of freedom in electron motion along the smaller
torus circumference, has become the interest of all. However, the
mixed chirality in TSN inhibits such manifestation. This work aims
to provide an insight toward the fabrication of m- and s-TSNs. The
TEM images show the sorted nanotubes of m-/s-SWNTs, and the SWNTs
were coiled into tori topology with a diameter of ∼150–200
nm.

Conclusions
In this report, we have addressed the mixed
species in TSN by the
hydrophobic emulsion process. Second, the raw SWNT bundles are sorted
into m- and s-SWNTs via gel column chromatography. The sorted SWNTs
showed a hydrophilic behavior because of the coverage of SDS, an anion
surfactant that used to disperse the nanotubes and control the interaction
with gel beads during the sorting process. Hence, SDS removal is critical
to induce the formation of tori. C/M/W extraction was applied to remove
the SDS coating. As the result, the sorted metallic and semiconducting
nanotubes were successfully coiled into tori topology with a diameter
of 150–200 nm. In addition, we have shown that the C/M/W extraction
is effective in SDS removal for nanotubes, and its tori/coil formation
process has not been communicated elsewhere. Throughout the ring formation
process, from species sorting to SDS removal and tori closure, minimal
chemical modification has been exerted on the SWNTs. It is utterly
significant because gel column chromatography has hitherto been progressively
pioneering in species sorting and very promising, and it has effectively
sorted out more than 20 isolated species and several optical isomers
from SWNTs. Therefore, the integration could provide loads of species
for tori formation which would facilitate the fundamental study in
transport mechanism and electrical properties.

Materials and Methods
Purified-grade HiPco SWNTs with
a length of 0.1–1.0 μm
and diameter of 0.8–1.2 nm were purchased from NanoIntegris,
Canada. All chemical reagents were used as purchased without any additional
distillation. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Deionized water was also used in all reactions. The sorting of metallic
and semiconducting nanotubes followed the work reported by Hirano
et al. Gel column chromatography enables the easy separation of SWNTs
into metallic and semiconducting species at considerable throughput
and resolution.62 However, the sorted species
were covered with SDS, an anion surfactant that used to disperse the
nanotubes and control the interaction with gel beads during the sorting
process. The TEM images were collected by a JEM-1400 (JEOL) at 100–200
kV.

Mixed Species Tori Formation via Emulsion
SWNTs (0.04
mg/mL) were redispersed in DMF by tip sonication (400 W) for 4 h.
Next, 10 μL of toluene was added in 1 mL of the obtained solution
of SWNTs under sonication. Next, 5 mL of water was injected to the
mixture at one shot to trigger the emulsion process under bath sonication.
The mixture turned into a whitish color immediately and then turned
into a transparent color. The emulsion was kept at room temperature
for 20 min. After 20 min, the solution was isolated with a centrifuge
at 12 000 rpm for 30 min and the final product was collected.
This final product was characterized by TEM and Raman spectroscopy.
Tori/coil with a size of ∼90 nm was obtained and characterized
by TEM. If the added toluene was increased to 20–40 μL,
then the diameter of TSN was also increased to ∼180–290
nm, respectively.

Metallic and Semiconducting Nanotube Sorting
The sorting
of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes followed the work reported
by Hirano et al. First, we dissolved SWNTs in SDS under tip sonication
for 1 h at 400 W power. Then, we performed ultracentrifugation at
215 000g for 30 min to remove impurities.
After centrifugation, we collected the supernatant for further use.
Next, to make the filtration column, a plastic syringe was plugged
with cotton, and then 5 mL of dextran exclusion gel was placed as
a medium for gel filtration. The black suspension which was achieved
after ultracentrifugation was dispersed in the column with 1% SDS.
By SDS washing, we successfully collected metallic SWNTs. Metallic
SWNTs were covered well by surfactant molecules when compared to semiconducting
SWNTs, resulting in weaker interactions with the gel, and therefore
metallic SWNTs were collected in unbound fractions passing directly
through the column. A 0.5 wt % SDS was further used to remove the
metallic SWNTs. After this, we can add different wt % (1, 0.5%) of
SDS disposed in the tube to get the different chiralities of the metallic
SWNTs.

Next, we washed the column to obtain different chiralities
of semiconducting SWNTs. A 0.5 wt % deoxycholate (DOC) was added to
the column to wash down the semiconducting SWNTs. The same process
was repeated, and after this, different wt % (1, 0.5%) of DOC were
added to collect the different chiralities of the semiconducting SWNTs.
Metallic SWNTs are mostly near-red to wine red in color with different
chiralities, and semiconducting SWNTs are near sky-blue in color with
different chiralities.

C/M/W Washing for SDS Removal
This washing methodology
was reported by Wessel and Flügge.161,60 First, 2 mL of solvent containing sorted SWNTs was mixed in 8 mL
of methanol. Next, 2 mL of chloroform and 6 mL of water were added
for phase separation. Then, the solution was vortexed until homogeneous
and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm. The sorted SWNTs were localized
at the interphase. The upper supernatant was removed carefully, and
then 6 mL of methanol was added to the lower chloroform phase. Again,
the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm. The upper
supernatant was carefully removed. The C/M/W ratio was 1:4:3 (v/v/v).

Emulsion for Metallic and Semiconducting TSNs
SDS removal
nanotubes (metallic or semiconducting) were then redispersed in DMF
(0.08 mg/mL) by tip sonication (400 W) for 4 h. A 10 μL of toluene
was added into 1 mL of the contained solution and vortexed to give
a homogeneous mixture. Next, 5 mL of water was injected into the mixture
at one shot to trigger the emulsion process under bath sonication.
The solution turned into a whitish color immediately and then turned
into a transparent color, indicating emulsification. The emulsion
was kept for 20 min at room temperature. The product was isolated
with a benchtop centrifuge at 12 000 rpm for 30 min, and the
final product was collected. This final product was characterized
by TEM and Raman spectroscopy.
