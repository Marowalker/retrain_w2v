Organic
molecular wires that operate stably at ambient temperatures
are a necessary first step toward practical and useful molecular-scale
electronic devices, which have thus far been hampered by many factors,
including the structural and electron configurational instability
of organic molecules. We report here that a single disulfanyl carbon-bridged
oligo(phenylenevinylene) (COPV6) molecule embedded between thermally
stable electroless Au-plated electrodes of a 4 nm nanogap undergoes
coherent resonant tunneling at both 9 and 300 K and functions even
after storage in air at room temperature. Such enormous stability
is ascribed to the unique structural characteristics of COPV6, that
is, rigidity, planarity, thermal stability, resistivity against oxidation
and reduction, and an organic insulating sheath that protects the
π-system. When sandwiched between the gaps without pinning,
this molecule behaves as a Coulomb island with sequential single-electron
tunneling at 9 K that disappears at 300 K while maintaining a stable
electron flow.

1 Introduction
The
size limits of the conventional top-down fabrication of integrated
circuits have spurred research on molecular-scale electronics.1−13 However, to date, organic molecular electronic devices have shown
optimal performance only under cryogenic conditions6,14 owing
to thermal fluctuation of both the organic structures and the metal
electrodes. The development of self-terminating electroless Au-plated
(ELGP) nanogap electrodes has provided a solution to the latter problem
because of the thermal stability of the nanogap up to 443 K (Figures 1b, S1.1, and S1.2).15−17 The former issue, however, awaits
development of new classes of molecular wires. To this end, we focused
on a 4.5 nm long disulfanyl carbon-bridged oligo(phenylenevinylene)18−20 (COPV6(SH)2) (Figure 1a), in which six phenylenevinylene
units (thus called COPV6) are connected by carbon bridges (blue).
This molecule, which has a molecular weight of 2674, resembles a spindle
(Figure 1c), in which
the center of the rigid π-conjugated system is spatially and
electronically isolated from its surroundings by four 4-octylphenyl
groups, whereas the SH terminals are less hindered to contact the
gold surface. When all of these groups are made of the bulky 4-octylphenyl
groups, no sign of bonding to the electrodes can be found. The parent
COPV6 scaffold is exceptionally stable, thermally (up to 623 K), under
laser irradiation, and even in its tetra-cationic forms.18−22 We report here that the chemical binding of a single COPV6(SH)2 molecule to an ELGP nanogap of an average
4 nm gap length creates a device referred to as SAuSH (Figure 1c) that
exhibits coherent resonant electron tunneling transportation (hereafter,
coherent tunneling) both at 9 and at 300 K, with conductance greater
than 2 nS. Although such temperature independence is a typical property
of electron tunneling, it has not been seen for flexible organic molecular
wires. The SAuSH device stored in air at ambient temperature
for 3 months showed the same electronic characteristics, attesting
to the unprecedented stability of the molecule and nanogap. Another
type of device (SH)2 (Figure 1c) was found and
underwent sequential single-electron tunneling (hereafter, sequential
tunneling) at 9 K.

2 Results and Discussion
The self-terminating
ELGP method15−17 produces 80 electrodes
at once with an average 4 nm nanogap in 90% yield in two steps (Figure 1b).16 First, we made electrodes with an Au/Ti initial nanogap
of approximately 20 nm on SiO2/Si (Figure S1.1) and then narrowed the gap to 4 nm by ELGP using
an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and Au(I) ion (Figure S1.2). The electrodes were immersed in a 0.5 mM toluene
solution of COPV6(SH)2 for 3
h at 353 K, rinsed twice with acetone and ethanol to remove any weakly
adsorbed molecules, and then subjected to electrical characterization
at 9 and 300 K. Before COPV6(SH)2 impregnation, none of the few hundred nanogaps showed conduction
(Figure 2a). After
impregnation, we found five functioning devices—three SAuSH (devices #1–3) and two (SH)2 (devices #4 and 5), whereas none of the remaining
gaps showed any current. Notably, we did not find any device that
shows the Id–Vd characteristics expected for the structurally symmetric COPV6(SAu)2 device formed in the nanogap.

forward drain bias voltage scan is shown as a solid black line, and
the reverse scan is shown as a red dashed line. (a) Nonfunctioning

2, and 3) at 9 K. Top: Id–Vd, middle: logarithmic plot of |Id|, and bottom: differential conductance (dId/dVd–Vd). (e) Device #1 at 300 K. (f) Device #1 after storage
in air for 3 months, measured at 9 K. Four well-defined dId/dVd peaks appear at Vd = −1.41, −1.16, 1.19, and 1.41
V on device #1.

All three SAuSH devices, #1, 2, and 3 (Figure 2b–d), exhibited Id–Vd characteristics
at 9 K typical of a coherent tunneling molecular wire. For all three
devices, bidirectional sweeps of the drain bias voltage from −1.5
to 1.5 V (solid black line; top) and from 1.5 to −1.5 V (red
dashed line) matched perfectly, indicating the stability of the device
at 9 K. The logarithmic plot of |Id| illustrates
that the no-current bias voltage region extended between −1.08
and 1.11 V (middle), and the dId/dVd diagram (bottom) numerically calculated from
the Id–Vd data shows four well-defined dId/dVd peaks, that is, on device #1, at Vd = −1.41, −1.16, 1.19, and 1.41 V. This Id–Vd characteristic
represents unprecedented long-range (4.5 nm) and stable coherent tunneling,
ascribable to the stability of both the wire and the ELGP nanogap.

A slight variation in the Vd values
among the three devices reflected the difference in the local physicochemical
configuration of the molecular wire. The differential conductance
peaks shown in the dId/dVd diagram (Figure 2b–d; bottom) were larger than 4 nS, a very large value
for such a long organic nanowire, owing to the effective electron
conjugation over the entire COPV6 framework. Previously studied flexible
oligophenylenevinylene and oligophenyleneethynylene molecules exhibited
coherent tunneling behavior only for those shorter than 2 nm.14,21,23−30

In the dId/dVd diagram of device #1 (Figure 2b; bottom), the first negative (−1.16
V) and
first positive peaks (1.19 V) differ by 2.35 V, that is, close to
the photoluminescence energy of 2.3 eV,18 and the overall peak voltage differences (0.26, 2.35, and 0.23 V)
agree in their relative magnitude with the calculated EHOMO–1 – EHOMO, EHOMO – ELUMO, and ELUMO – ELUMO+1 energy gaps of 0.35, 2.74, and 0.29 eV,
respectively (Figure 3a). As illustrated by the model in Figure 1c, the molecule in the SAuSH device is pinned only at the drain Au electrode by S–Au bond
formation. A band diagram of the coherent tunneling is shown in Figure 3, where the Fermi
level of the source electrode moves with the bias voltage because
of van der Waals contact of the free HS side of the molecule to this
electrode. The drain current is enhanced by the coherent tunneling
process when the Fermi level of the Au source electrode coincides
with the molecular orbital energy levels of COPV6(SH)2. A similar diagram was previously proposed
for a one-sided pinning structure of the tip/vacuum/tribenzosubporphine/C7S
mixed SAM/Au(111) system.10

band diagrams of the Au source electrode/HS-COPV6-S-/Au drain electrode

Most remarkably, the SAuSH device sustains thermal
cycling at 9 and 300 K. The Id–Vd characteristics of device #1 at 300 K still
shows coherent tunneling behavior (Figure 2e), whereas the no-current bias voltage region
is nearly half, reflecting thermal broadening of molecular resonant
tunneling phenomena (Figure 2b). The temperature insensitivity is a signature of electron
tunneling, as found previously for photoexcited electron tunneling
through shorter COPV nanowires.19

A comparison of the dId–dVd diagrams for device #1 at 9 K (Figure 2b) and 300 K (Figure 2e) indicates that the first
negative and positive peaks derived from highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) at 300
K broke down to multiple peaks, whereas the peaks derived from HOMO
– 1 and LUMO + 1 remained largely unchanged. We suggest that
the temperature insensitivity of the latter stems from the presence
of a node in the center of HOMO – 1 and LUMO + 1, whereas the
sensitivity of the former stems from its absence in HOMO and LUMO
(Figure 3b).

Of a few hundred devices examined at 9 K, we found two (devices
#4 and 5) that showed Id–Vd characteristics of sequential tunneling attributable
to the (SH)2 device based on
the Coulomb blockade effect at 9 K (Figure 4a,b). At 300 K, the no-current voltage regions
disappeared as shown in Figure 4c—a typical behavior of sequential single-electron
tunneling. Details follow in the next paragraph.

tunneling junction system. (e) Schematic energy band diagram at zero
bias and positive bias V = e/C.

By applying consecutive
bidirectional sweeps of drain bias voltage
from −0.8 to 0.8 V (forward bias sweep; solid black line) and
from 0.8 to −0.8 V (backward; red dashed line), we observed
stable and reproducible Id–Vd characteristics for both sweep directions.
A no-current bias voltage region was observed over a bias voltage
range of 280 mV between −0.14 and 0.14 V, which is about one-eighth
of the range of the coherent tunneling scheme at 9 K shown in Figure 2b. The first and
second stairs at both positive and negative voltages were observed
at 0.22, 0.60, and −0.19 and −0.53 V, respectively.
From Figure 4b, we
calculated a differential conductance of ca. 20 pS, which is 2 orders
of magnitude smaller than that of the coherent tunneling scheme determined
from Figure 2b–d.
The current flow at 300 K under the application of Vd remained in the same order at 9 K (Figure 4a vs c), attesting to the stability
of the COPV6 device at 300 K owing to the thermal stability of the
nanogap and the COPV6 system that can form a stable tetra-cation,
as examined by cyclic voltammetry at ambient temperature.20

To further probe the origin of the Id–Vd characteristics,
we examined
an equivalent circuit of double-barrier tunneling junctions (Figure 4d).31−34 From this model, we obtained a theoretical Id–Vd curve that fits very
well with the experimental one (Figure 4a,b; blue dashed-dotted line), using five parameters
(Figure 4d; Supporting Information section 2.2): resistances
and capacitances of both tunneling barriers (R1, R2, C1, and C2) and the fractional electron
charge present on the Coulomb island (Q0):29,32,35R1 = 46.8 GΩ, R2 = 13.6
GΩ, C1 = 0.42 aF, C2 = 0.42 aF, and Q0 = 0.1e for device #4, and R1 = 12.0
GΩ, R2 = 11.0 GΩ, C1 = 0.41 aF, C2 =
0.4 aF, and Q0 = −0.1e for device #5 (where e is the elementary charge).

With this agreement between theory and experiments, we concluded
that COPV6(SH)2 behaved as a
Coulomb island—for which we suggest physisorption of the molecule
by its hydrocarbon onto the electrode surface [(SH)2 in Figure 1c], where there is no electronic coupling. The estimated
tunneling resistances were similar to the physisorbed tunneling resistance
previously reported for an Au nanoparticle protected by octanethiol
chains embedded between two Au electrodes,36−39 further supporting the (SH)2 device structure.

The
almost same charging energies Ec = e2/2C in this system
were evaluated as 95.3 and 98.3 meV for devices #4 and #5, respectively,
a value that is in good agreement with the long, planar, rigid nature
of the π-conjugation in the COPV wire, as compared with the
shorter and more flexible OPV analogues,14,21 in which the width of the Coulomb diamonds along the Vd axis (ΔVd) reflected
the value of Ec as ΔVd = 4Ec.31,40 The calculated charging energies of such short molecular wires based
on experimental Coulomb diamonds14,21 are approximately
440 and 110 meV, respectively, and the 95.3 and 98.3 meV values are
expectedly smaller.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have shown that the SAuSH device exhibited
the archetypal behaviors of coherent tunneling devices, including
tolerance to thermal cycling between low and high temperatures, which
we had hoped to see for practical and useful organic molecular wires.
Such stability is distinct from that of devices using flexible organic
molecular wires. Given the many possible variations available for
the COPV class of molecules, as well as for the ELGP nanogap configurations,
we expect that the selective formation of either SAuSH or (SH)2 type device can be controlled by synthetic modifications
and adjustments of gap separation and molecular length, and that the
data reported here will provide a solid foundation for exploring new
directions of molecular-scale electronic research in the future.
