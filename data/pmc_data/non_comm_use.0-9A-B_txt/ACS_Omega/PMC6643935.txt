A Cu(II)-selective electrode has
been fabricated by utilizing a
mechanochemically synthesized copper-specific ionophore “L”
embedded in a poly(vinyl chloride) membrane. 2-Nitrophenyloctylether
and sodium tetraphenylborate have been used as a plasticizer and as
a solvent mediator, respectively, and found to be enhancing the sensitivity
of the fabricated ion-selective electrode (ISE). A range of membranes
(S1–S7) with varying compositions were casted and investigated
in ISE. Results revealed an excellent Nernstian response of 29.38
± 0.55 mV/dec for the ISE S6. The fabricated ISE operates well
in the pH window 4.0–7.5, and the limit of detection was found
to be 5 μM (0.3 ppm). Quick response time (15 s), long shelf-life,
and selectivity (on the order of 10–4 and 10–5) over a number of interfering cations enabled S6
promising for real off laboratory sample analysis and can be employed
to detect copper ion in various industrial as well as biological and
environmental samples. To demonstrate the practical application of
these ISE, the Cu concentration in the digested printed circuit board
has been estimated using the standard calibration plot. The fabricated
ISE has been regenerated through extracting copper by chelating with
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Metal
ions such as lead(II), mercury(II), copper(II), nickel(II),
and cadmium(II) are considered to be major pollutants and, hence,
supposed to be a serious threat to the environment. Among all those
major contaminants, copper is present in high abundance in Earth’s
crust and being extensively utilized for various industries, agricultural,
and domestic purposes.1,2 Global consumption of copper in
industry falls third in ranking after iron and aluminum. Copper possesses
a few interesting physical properties such as high electrical conductivity,
high ductility, malleability, thermal conductivity, and resistance
to corrosion, which makes it a useful metal compared to others.3 Copper is widespread in various industries such
as manufacturing of electromagnet, compressors, electric wire, and
so forth. Copper is also extensively used in various chemical industries
as an activator in froth floatation of sulfide ores, production of
wood preservatives, electroplating, manufacture of azo-dye, as a mordant
for textile dyes, in petroleum refining, and manufacturer of copper
compounds3−13 Therefore, recoupment of copper cannot be compromised. On the other
hand, World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that intake of copper
should not surpass 10–12 mg/day and average concentration of
copper in the blood should not exceed 100–150 μg/dL (15.7–23.6
μM) under normal conditions for adults. The presence of copper
in higher concentration is considered to be toxic, and it can directly
affect human body causing several adverse health conditions such as
gastrointestinal, catarrh, hypoglycaemia, and dyslexia. Excessive
contamination of copper can cause Wilson’s disease.14,15 For this purpose, selective and trace detection of copper in environmental
samples such as wastewater is highly desirable. There are many methods
that one can use to quantify trace amount of copper in environmental
samples such as atomic absorption spectrometry,16,17 inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES),18 anodic stripping voltammetry,19−21 chromatography,22,23 gravimetric detection,24,25 or photometry.26−31 Although these methods are technically sluggish for routine analysis
of multiple environmental samples, it requires sample pretreatment
and state-of-the-art infrastructure facility. An ion-selective electrode
(ISE), a type of potentiometric sensor, is an important subclass of
electrochemical sensors. The advantage of using ISE is its size, portability,
low cost, miniaturization, low-energy consumption, and so forth. These
features make it attractive for practical use. Typically, the ISE
consists of polymeric membrane containing an ionophore (neutral or
charged carrier) which selectively binds with the desired analyte.
The concept was established a decade ago followed by substantial development
that was attempted by many research groups contributing many factors
such as improvement in limit of detection (LOD), new membrane materials,
new sensing concept, and deeper insight of the modeling of such ISE.32−35 Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a well-known and undebatable polymer
material being actively used as the matrix for ISEs from decades.
The semipermeability of PVC makes it perfect for this type of application.36−40 A good number of copper-selective ionophores, derived from calixarenes,41 porphyrins,42 crown
ether,43 macrocyclic polyethers,44 cyclic tetrapeptides,45 thiophenes,46 and so forth, were explored
in the fabrication of ISEs for Cu(II). However, there are major bottlenecks
with those reported ISEs such as higher LOD or serious interference
from other cations such as Fe3+, Na+, Sr2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cs+, Hg2+, Ag+, and K+. Furthermore, all of
these ionophores were synthesized following the traditional solution-based
refluxing technique, which not only requires high temperature and
harsh conditions but also generates large amount of wastes. In our
recent endeavor,47−50 we have showed how a green preparative technique called mechanochemical
(MC) reactions can be useful and economical for the one-pot synthesis
of artificial receptors. Performing a liquid-assisted grinding of
a mechanosynthesized51 tridentate zwitterion
with a very popular transducer moiety known as rhodamine 6g hydrazide
(also prepared mechanochemically)50 has
resulted in the synthesis of a pentadentate ionophore “L”.
We have characterized this mechanochemically synthesized probe “L”
by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR)–attenuated total reflection, and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) techniques. In this work, we have prepared a series of ISEs
using the PVC membrane along with hydrophobic ionophore “L”
which turned out to be highly selective for sensing Cu(II) ion in
aqueous solution. The ion-selective membrane was characterized by
the electron dispersion X-ray technique. The Cu(II) selective electrode
shows an excellent Nernstian slope of 29.38 ± 0.55 mV/dec with
a LOD as low as 5 μM (0.317 ppm). The electrode shows independence
of pH at physiological condition (pH 4.0–7.5), quick response
time (15 s), long lifetime, and selectivity over a number of interfering
cations. The ion-selective membrane can be regenerated after leaching
out the copper from the membrane surface by chelating with ethylediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA). The regenerated membrane shows similar Nernstian response
compared to the pristine ion-selective membrane. The fabricated ISE
also shows excellent response to the real-field sample, demonstrating
huge potential of the fabricated ISE.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Ionophore L
To obtain the purity of the synthesized probe,
PXRD and FTIR had
been performed. PXRD (Figure 1) and FTIR (Figure 2) profiles of mechanosynthesized L with the corresponding
patterns of L synthesized by the earlier reported method47 manifest that the MC pathway yielded a single
and reproducible compound. Finally, the morphology of the mechanosynthesized
orange powder of L as observed by field emission SEM (Figure 3a) is corroborating with the
morphology of L prepared via solution refluxing method (Figure 3b).

Figure 1 PXRD comparison of L
synthesized by two different methods.

Figure 2 Comparative FTIR spectrum of the synthesized probe prepared by
two different methods, MC and standard solution method.

image of
L prepared by the solution method showing equivalent morphology.

Final confirmation of the molecular
structure of mechanosynthesized
L was established by 1H NMR and electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data provided in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Morphology
of the Membrane
The fabrication
of Cu(II)-selective membrane is schematically depicted in Scheme S1
(Supporting Information).

The bare
membrane (i.e., without ionophore) was fully transparent. The pristine
membrane was denoted as (A). It turns light pink upon the addition
of the ionophore and denoted as (B), whereas upon dipped into the
Cu(II) solution, the color of the membrane turns dark red because
of the formation of Cu(II) complex and this membrane is denoted as
(C). The membrane (B) was dipped into 10 mM Cu(II) solution and equilibrated
for 12 h and washed several times with Milli-Q water to remove excess
Cu(II) from the membrane surface. Then, the membrane was dried overnight
at room temperature. A small piece of 1 × 1 cm2 from
the membrane (C) was cut and placed onto the SEM stub. Ten nanometer
gold sputter coating was done to get conducting surface for performing
SEM. SEM–energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM–EDX) is an excellent
tool to map any heavy metals within a specific surface topology. The
morphology of the membrane surface is depicted in Figure 4a. The result shows a dense
membrane surface, conventionally prepared for the ISE. SEM–EDX
mapping was done to check the binding of Cu(II) in the membrane surface,
and the mapping is shown in Figure 4b. Cu is mapped in red color. 5.63 wt % of Cu is detected
by SEM–EDX mapping over the PVC surface. Results clearly suggests
binding of copper to the surface of the membrane. Copper is also seen
spatially distributed over the membrane surface, suggesting homogeneity
of the membrane surface.

(b) EDX elemental
map of Cu(II)-selective membrane showing distribution of Cu(II) over
the PVC membrane surface.

2.3 Effect of Membrane Composition
The
sensor output of an ion-selective membrane significantly depends on
the composition of the membrane and chemical activity of the solvent
mediator. Solvent mediator is one of the major components in an ISE
as it is solely responsible for ion migration across the membrane
surface. Generally, few important characteristics are taken into consideration
while choosing solvent mediator such as high lipophilicity to avoid
dehydration of membrane, high molecular weight to give optimum stability
across the membrane surface, ability to dissolve polymeric substrate
and other additives, and low exudation property from the polymer matrix
to create channel for ion migration. Plasticizer is another crucial
component of ISE which not only enhances the workability of the membrane
but also significantly increases the narrow concentration range and
the shelf-life. Therefore, optimizing all of these components may
lead to achieve proper zero current across the membrane surface. The
measurement should ideally be performed in open-circuit condition
under zero current, but there is some small amount of current flows
in the circuit required to complete the electronic circuit of the
instrument that is practically nullified by the high impedance shunt
imposed by the instrument. The potential thus generated across the
membrane surface is due to concentration gradient. Hence, the membrane
composition plays an important role to control over Nernstian response.
We have changed the mediator from sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB)
and oleic acid (OA) and also compared without using the mediator.
The equilibrium potential across the membrane surface measured with
the variation of copper concentrations and the results is depicted
in Figure 5, and the
slope is provided in Table 1.

Figure 5 Effect of solvent mediator in sensory response.

The
results show drastic change in Nernstian response over working
concentration range without any mediator. Using OA as a mediator results
Nernstian slope of 26.73 mV/dec (membrane S4), whereas using NaTPB
results 29.35 mV/dec, which is very close to the ideal Nernstian response.
The result clearly suggests that NaTPB shows superior performance
than OA. The Nernstian slope becomes much higher (34.09 mV/dec) when
no mediator was used (control). The result can be attributed by the
influence of solvent to fabricate ion-selective membrane. Weakly coordinating
or non-coordinating solvents do not produce functionality to liquid-membrane
ion-selective electrodes. Hence, there is a need of external mediator
which not only dissolves the exchanger salt but also partly solvates
the salt metal ion and allows the ions to flow. We have also used
plasticizers of different polarities such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP),
dioctyl sebacate (DOS), and 2-nitrophenyloctylether (NPOE). The comparison
plot of ISE sensor output is displayed in Figure 6, and the Nernstian slope is showed in Table 1. The results clearly
suggest that NPOE can function as a superior plasticizer than DOS
and DOP. The polarizability of NPOE (24) is far greater than that
of DOS and DOP, and this may presumably be the reason for the superior
result. The most important factor for a liquid channel membrane is
its ability to percolate charge between internal solution and its
external counterfeit. The flux generated due to concentration gradient
will result a drift till the concentration of two compartments becomes
equal. The role of a plasticizer is to control the percolation of
the synthesized semipermeable membrane. For obvious fact, it is not
possible to choose a fixed plasticizer; hence, different variations
were tried to get the best result.

Figure 6 Effect of plasticizer in sensory response.

Different plasticizers generate
different polarizabilities which
may lead to different percolation kinetics and may lead to super Nernstian
or sub Nernstian response. High polarizability of NPOE is thus able
to create better percolation compared to DOS and DOP, resulting better
result close to ideal. Although, all of these factors come to the
point of interest after the firm binding of the ionophore L with the
desired analyte.

2.4 Effect of pH
pH-dependent
study was
performed with the fabricated Cu(II)-specific ISEs S6 in the two different
Cu(II) concentrations of 1.0 × 10–3 and 1.0
× 10–4 M over the pH range 2.0–10.0.
Solution pH was adjusted by adding 1.0 M each of HCl and NaOH. Figure 7 demonstrates the
results of this study. Clearly, the pH range 3.0–7.5 is independent
of potential and can be taken as a working pH range for S6. Change
in equilibrium potential above and below this potential window can
be attributed for hydrolysis of Cu(II) and presence of more H+ competing with Cu(II) at lower pH.5

Figure 7 Effect
of pH on the fabricated Cu(II)-ISE.

2.5 Potentiometric Calibration Plot
There
are several theories available in the scientific literature on ISE,
and still extensive research is continuing on various aspects of understanding
of conceptual mechanism as there are several protocols reported about
the function of ISEs. The theory is firmly based on a simple hypothesis
where the basic protocol is: sample|ion-selective membrane/film|internal
contact, and potentiometric response is recorded under open-circuit
condition (zero input current). A concentration gradient is generated
by changing the strength of the sample solution and resulting development
of potential gradient (membrane potential difference or Donnan potential
difference) across the membrane interface which can be measured against
the standard reference electrode, a calibration plot can be obtained.
The entire experiment is done in a conventional two-electrode system
where the ISE is treated as a working electrode and Ag/AgCl (sat.
KCl) as a reference electrode. The slope of the calibration curve
is termed Nernstian slope, and it is the function of different concentrations
of analytes. The potential of the fabricated membrane was measured
in the range 1 × 10–6 to 1 × 10–1 M. Two membrane compositions: S6 and S7 results were very close
to the ideal Nernstian response (29.5 mV/dec). The calibration plot
of S6 with 5% error bar is depicted in Figure 8. The Nernstian slope, calculated to be 29.35
± 0.01 mV/dec (R2 = 0.9934), reaches
very close to the ideal Nernstian slope for divalent cation (29.5
mV/dec). The response of S6 is much closer to the ideal value rather
than S7; hence, S6 has been utilized for further investigation. The
calibration plot of S7 with 5% error bar is depicted in Figure S1
(Supporting Information). The Nernstian
slope for S7, calculated to be 30.13 ± 0.39 mV/dec, also reaches
very close to the ideal Nernstian slope for divalent cation. However,
membrane S6 showed lower LOD for detecting Cu(II) (5 μM) in
the aqueous medium. The calibration plot was done using the potentiometric
responses obtained from S6.

Figure 8 Potentiometric calibration plot of S6 with 5%
error bar showing
a Nernstian slope of 29.38 ± 0.55 mV/dec having a detection limit
of 5 μM of Cu(II).

2.6 Potentiometric Selectivity
The selectivity
is the most crucial factor for the success of an ISE. Thus, selectivity
coefficient is an important parameter to evaluate ISEs. Fixed interference
method (FIM) is a widespread technique to measure potentiometric selectivity
of an ISE with other possible interferents (an+).35 FIM is based
on the semiempirical Nikolskii–Eisemman equation, which depicts
the electromotive force (EMF) of a cell comprising an ISE and a reference
electrode, and is measured for solutions of constant activity of the
interfering ion, aB, (internal solution)
and varying activity of the primary ion, aA (analyte). The EMF values obtained are plotted versus the logarithm
of the activity of the primary ion. The intersection of the extrapolated
linear portions of this plot indicates the value of aA that is to be used to calculate (KA,BPot) from the
following equation  where both zA and zB have same signs. In FIM,
(KA,BPot) for
different interferents was evaluated by keeping the interferent concentration
fixed (1 × 10–2) and the copper concentration
is varied. The values of selectivity coefficients for S6 and S7 are
shown in Table 2. The
value ∼1 resembles equal response to primary and interference
ions. Moreover, lower value of log(KA,BPot) resembles
sufficient selectivity of the ionophore toward Cu(II) in the presence
of other interfering analytes. It is clearly seen from Table 2 that there is no major interferents
for the fabricated ion-selective membrane which infers the effectiveness
of L toward Cu(II).

2.7 Regeneration of Membrane Activity after EDTA
Treatment
EDTA is known to be an excellent chelating agent
which can readily bind with copper. To check the efficiency of EDTA
to regenerated current Cu(II)-selective membrane, S6 membrane was
dipped in 0.1 M EDTA solution overnight at room temperature. The membrane
has immediately turned light brown from dark red, giving indication
of leaching of copper from the membrane surface. The membrane was
washed thoroughly with Milli-Q water and then kept till dry. The dried
membrane was then again dipped in 10 mM Cu(II) solution and kept overnight
for regeneration of the ion-selective activity. Sensor response measured
before and after EDTA treatment is compared in Figure S2, showing almost equivalent sensor response before
and after EDTA treatment. The result clearly suggests that the fabricated
ion-selective membrane act as a kind of “switch off–switch
on” pattern which ultimately increases its reusability. The
fabricated ion-selective membrane becomes quickly inactive after treatment
of EDTA and regains its activity more quickly after retreatment with
the Cu(II) solution.

2.8 Real Sample Analysis
Real sample
analysis had been done with the fabricated Cu(II)-specific ISE. For
this purpose, e-waste had been used as a potential source of copper
as it consists huge amount of copper along with many other harmful
metals which leads to major environmental catastrophe regarding metal
contamination. Printed circuit board (PCB) is a major e-waste component,
consisting lots of metals which contaminates water due to inadequate
discard by the industry. PCB was thus taken as a real sample for this
experiment. For this purpose, PCB was digested in 10 mL aqua regia
and the pretreated solution was diluted up to 100 mL in Milli-Q water
and the solution was filtered through a Whatman filter paper three
times to avoid any undissolved/suspended particles. The pretreatment
is depicted in Scheme S2. The pH of the
solution was adjusted to 7.4 by adding NaOH. Unknown dilutions were
made from the stock filtrate, and the potentiometric calibration plot
was performed using 1 × 10–3 M of Cu(II) solution
(pH 7.4) as an internal reference, and membrane S6 is used as a standard
ion-selective membrane. The membrane is dipped for 12 h in prepared
unknown dilutions for conditioning. The color changed from light brown
to dark red gives first confirmation of copper binding to the membrane
surface. The pretreated four different unknown dilutions were performed
for potentiometric measurement. The potentials generated for those
unknown analytes were measured against the standard Ag/AgCl (sat.
KCl) reference electrode, and the data are feed into standard calibration
plot, and the amount of copper was estimated. The potentiometric estimation
plot is furnished in Figure 9. ICP-OES was performed with those analyte solutions to tally
the result with ion-selective potentiometric data. The comparison
results of copper activity obtained from both ICP-OES and ISE are
depicted at Table S1 (Supporting Information). The result shows excellent comparison of estimated copper with
a conventional ICP-OES technique. This makes the Cu(II)-selective
electrode more viable for field use.

the measured potential value into standard calibration plot.

3 Conclusions
MC reaction between rhodamine 6g hydrazide with a tridentate zwitterion
resulted an ionophore L that upon incorporating into the PVC matrix
along with NPOE as a plasticizer and NaTPB as a solvent mediator developed
a Cu(II)-specific ISE. Composition of ISE S6 shows excellent Nernstian
response of 29.38 ± 0.55 mV/dec, with a LOD of 5 μM in
aqueous solution. Fabricated ISE composition shows quick response
time (15 s), long shelf-life, and selectivity (on the order of 10–4 and 10–5) over a number of interfering
cations. The developed copper-selective electrode successfully detects
Cu(II), extracted from PCB, and the result is compared with the conventional
ICP-OES technique. Moreover, it is almost impossible to spend a single
day without copper but easy detection can help to prevent contamination
of copper and hence the fabricated Cu(II)-selective electrode can
be useful where Cu(II) detection is necessary.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
All reagents were of analytical
grade and were used without further purification. High molecular weight
PVC, NaTPB, DOP, NPOE, rhodamine 6g, 5-bromosalicaldehyde, paraformaldehyde,
hydrazine hydrate, and N,N,N′-trimethylethylenediamine were purchased from Aldrich.
DOS, OA, and EDTA were purchased
from Alfa-Aesar. Chloride salts of Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Pb(II),
Ba(II), Mg(II), Hg(II), Ca(II), Cd(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Al(III),
Cr(III), Na(I), K(I), and NH4(I) were also purchased from
Aldrich. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was purchased from Merck.

4.2 MC Synthesis of Rhodamine 6g
Synthetic
procedure for the preparation of the copper-specific ionophore “L”
has been reported earlier from our group.47 In that method, we performed conventional solution-refluxing process,
that is, high reaction temperature, and bulk solvent for the synthesis
of “L” has been used.

In our laboratory, for quite
some time, we have been exploring the opportunities of a one-pot and
straightforward green preparative technique, the MC reactions for
the development of ionophores for chemosensors.50 In continuation of our earlier endeavor, when stoichiometric
amount of a yellow-colored tridentate zwitterion (Figure 1) which was ground manually
and thoroughly (for ca. 5–6 min) in a mortar-pestle with a
light pink colored compound rhodamine 6g hydrazide (Scheme 1) in the presence of few drops
of methanol, we ended up with a light orange-colored solid at room
temperature. The change in color was observed quickly, and it did
not change further with continuous grinding, therefore ascertaining
fast completion of the MC reaction.

4.3 Membrane
Preparation
The ISE membrane
was prepared following the reported conventional methods.3 A total of 180 mg of a mixture containing 33%
PVC (w/v), 3% (w/v) L, 62% (w/v) NPOE, and 2% (w/v) NaTPB was dissolved
in 2 mL of dry THF under continuous stirring. The clear solution was
poured into a glass ring (internal diameter 24 mm) which is fixed
tightly on a glass plate with a rubber band. After complete evaporation
of solvent at ambient conditions, a homogeneous membrane with a thickness
of about 0.2 mm was obtained. The viscosity of the solution and solvent
evaporation rate were controlled minutely to obtain good quality membranes
with reproducible features as thickness and morphology of the membrane
play a major role to sensor response. The membrane was carefully removed
from the glass ring and mounted to a “pyrex” glass tube
and subsequently inserted into ISE body. A solution of 0.01 M CuCl2 was used as an internal solution. The electrode was left
in 0.01 M CuCl2 for conditioning overnight. Ag/AgCl (saturated
KCl) was used as a reference electrode. The pertinent data on composition
of the membrane and its performance in ISE are given in Table 1.

4.4 Apparatus
and Potential Measurement
Potentiometric measurements were
carried out at 25 °C on a Keithley
source meter unit model number 2635 A by setting up the following
cell assembly:

Ag/AgCl|1.0 × 10–2 M Cu
Cl2 solution|ion-selective membrane|test solution||Ag/AgCl
(sat KCl)

A fixed concentration of Cu(II) was taken as an internal
solution
(10 mM), and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) was used as a reference electrode.
A linear range of aqueous Cu(II) solution starting from 1 × 10–6 to 1 × 10–1 M was taken. The
source meter unit was put at zero input current mode, and output potential
was measured. To verify the sensor response, a plot of equilibrium
potential versus concentration was plotted. Selectivity coefficient
(KA,BPot) was evaluated using the “FIM”.52 The concentration of internal solution during
the interference study by FIM was 10–2 M. The structure
of the product was characterized by a XRD PANAnalytical Empyrean Series
2 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å)
radiation. The field-emission SEM imaging has been done on JEOL JSM-7100F,
whereas elemental mapping of the ion-selective membrane was done by
EDX analysis (Oxford instruments X-Max), FTIR was performed on a PerkinElmer
G FTIR spectrometer.
