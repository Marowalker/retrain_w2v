This
work attempted to establish the relationship between the dispersion
morphology and the viscous flow behavior of clay dispersions in soybean
oil fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) at 2 and 65 °C. The clays used
in this study include raw montmorillonite (Mt) and three kinds of
organoclays prepared by ion exchange modification of Mt by cetyltrimethylammonium
chloride (OC16), dihexadecyldimethylammonium chloride (ODC16), and
trihexadecylmethylammonium chloride (OTC16), respectively. The X-ray
diffraction and water contact angle results demonstrated that greater
alkyl chain number of surfactants led to greater interlayer space
and stronger hydrophobicity of organoclays. Due to the good affinity
of the surfactant and FAEE, OC16 exhibited the most stable dispersion
in FAEE between 2–65 °C, which resulted in the best flat
rheological property. The molecular structures of multiple chain surfactants
were quite different from that of FAEE, resulting in weak affinity
between organoclays (ODC16 and OTC16) and FAEE. The sheets of ODC16
and OTC16 tended to aggregate at 2 °C, forming a gel structure,
thus significantly increasing the low shear rate viscosity (LSRV)
and yield stress. At 65 °C, with the expansion of FAEE and the
stronger thermal motion of sheets, the dispersions of ODC16 and OTC16
were improved, destroying the original gel structure and resulting
in significant decreases in LSRV and yield stress. This study confirmed
that stable clay/FAEE dispersions tended to exhibit flat rheology,
which could serve as a basis for the application of clay/biodiesel
dispersion in deep-water drilling.

1 Introduction
Drilling fluid
is a general term for various circulating fluids during drilling and
is always divided into two types according to the continuous phase,
the water-based ones and the oil-based ones.1−3 Drilling fluids have a variety of functions
including (1) carrying and suspending the cuttings, (2) stabilizing
the wellbore and balancing geological pressure, (3) cooling and lubricating
the drill bit, and (4) transmitting hydrodynamics, and so forth.4 In recent years, with the development of oil
and gas exploitation, the number of drilling operations in deep water
has been increasing gradually.5 Because
of the nature of the continuous phase, oil-based drilling fluids exhibit
better properties in shale inhibition, hydrate inhibition, lubrication,
and reservoir protection than the water-based ones, endowing them
with great advantages in deep-water drilling. However, in addition
to conventional performance requirements, deep-water drilling places
further demands on drilling fluids.

On the one hand, the drilling
fluids used in the deep-water process should meet the marine environmental
requirements. The environmental performance of the oil-based drilling
fluid is mainly determined by the nature of the base oil. The traditional
oil-based drilling fluid mainly uses diesel or white oil as the continuous
phase. The aromatic content is relatively high and thus is not easy
to be biodegraded.6 For solving this problem,
synthetic organic media such as linear alpha olefins (LAO, CH3—CnH2n—CH=CH2, n is 6 to
18) and gas-to-liquids (GTL, straight alkyl line CnH2n+2, n is
12 to 21) have been gradually used as continuous phases in recent
years.7 A comparison of the base oils is
listed in Table 1.
Compared with the traditional ones, these synthetic base oils are
of high price, but more environmentally friendly, because they have
low aromatic contents, which are easier to be biodegraded.

Base Oils

GTL	2.7	0.78	≤0.05	112	
On
the other hand, the special environment during deep-water drilling
requires relatively stable rheological properties of drilling fluids
over a wide temperature range. The temperatures encountered in each
process during deep-water drilling are as follows: mud-line temperature
is often lower than 4 °C; flow-line temperature is always between
12–21 °C; and bottom-hole circulating temperature is usually
higher than 65 °C.8 For traditional
oil-based drilling fluids, organoclays have long been used as the
basic rheologically controlling material, providing necessary rheological
properties such as yield point (YP), low shear rate viscosity (LSRV),
and gel strength for oil-based drilling fluids to meet the requirements
of solid dispersion and wellbore cleaning.9 Organoclays are always hydrophobically modified from montmorillonite
(Mt), making it easier for them to expand or even exfoliate in the
organic phase, forming a card-house network with the lamellar structure
originated from the raw Mt. Therefore, organoclays are often used
as a tackifier for organic phase dispersions and enhancer for polymer
nanocomposites.10−16 However, these key rheological
properties would exhibit a great increase under the mud-line temperature,
resulting in a much higher equivalent circulating density (ECD). As
the narrow safe density windows were encountered in deep-water drilling
operations, the high rheology of drilling fluids at low temperatures
will always cause severe drilling fluid losses or even serious downhole
accidents.17,18 To solve this problem, the first step is
to select a base oil with viscosity that varies slightly with temperature.
For example, the synthetic organic phases commonly used in deep-water
drilling are just meeting the requirement. Then, a special rheological
modifier should be added to interact with organoclays for changing
the gel strength variation with temperature.19,20 Finally,
the drilling fluid will exhibit relatively constant YP, LSRV, and
gel strength, namely, the flat-rheology synthetic-based (FRSB) drilling
fluid, which has long been successfully applied in the offshore field.

Despite the successful application of the FRSB drilling fluids
in offshore drilling, they still have some defects among which the
most important are cost and sustainability issues. Although the ocean
environmental requirements are fulfilled, the synthetic base oils
are always quite expensive and nonrenewable.21 In contrast, vegetable oils are renewable and often cost-effective.
Researchers have explored the use of vegetable oil derivatives such
as biodiesel as an alternative to diesel since the early 90s.22−24 Some of them also tried to use
biodiesel as a new continuous phase for oil-based drilling fluids.25,26 Biodiesel is a product of transesterification of vegetable oil with
methanol. It is mainly composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl
esters, with much lower viscosity than the original vegetable oil
and excellent environmental friendliness (meet the marine environmental
requirements). It is feasible to use biodiesel-based drilling fluids
in deep-water drilling to have a good control on the rheological properties
over a wide temperature range. Additionally, with the development
of transgenic technology, the price of transgenic vegetable oil is
much lower than that of conventional ones, bringing greater advantages
of large-scale production and application of biodiesel. Considering
the wide application prospect of biodiesel-based drilling fluids in
deep-water drilling, this work tried to study the morphological and
rheological temperature responses of organoclay dispersions in fatty
acid ethyl ester (FAEE). The organoclays used in this study were prepared
by modifying the raw Mt with different quaternary ammonium salt cations.
The FAEE was prepared by transesterification of genetically modified
soybean oil with absolute ethanol in the laboratory because ethanol
is less toxic than methanol.27 Also, the
longer alcohol chain will provide biodiesel with a better flow performance
at low temperatures, which is conducive to deep-water drilling.28 Based on the results of morphological and rheological
experiments, the relationship between the morphologies and the rheological
behaviors of clay/FAEE dispersions over a temperature range of 2–65
°C was explained. This study will be beneficial for the application
of organoclay/biodiesel dispersions in deep-water drilling.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
The genetically
modified soybean oil was bought from the Yihai Jiali Golden Dragon
Fish grain, Oil and Food Co., Ltd. The anhydrous ethanol (purity ≥99.7%)
and sodium hydroxide (powder, purity ≥96%) were bought from
the Saan Chemical Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. The raw Mt (cation
exchange capacity (CEC) was 120 mmol/100 g) was kindly provided by
the Shidabocheng Drilling Fluid Company (Beijing, China), milled,
and sieved with a 200 mesh sieve. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) result
of Mt is listed in Table 2. Cationic surfactants (purity ≥90%) used for organoclay
preparation are listed in Table 3. All of the surfactants were bought from Usolf Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd. (Jinan, China).

Preparation
2.2 Preparation of the Soybean Oil Fatty Acid Ethyl
Ester
Genetically modified soybean oil (500 mL, about 0.50
mol) was poured into a 1000 mL beaker and preheated at 60 °C
for 1 h. Sodium hydroxide powder (2.00 g, 0.05 mol) was added into
138 g (3.00 mol) of anhydrous ethanol and stirred with a magnetic
stirrer at 1000 rpm and 60 °C until the sodium hydroxide was
totally dissolved. Then, the sodium hydroxide/anhydrous ethanol solution
was added into the soybean oil and stirred with a magnetic stirrer
at 1000 rpm and 60 °C for 1 h. During the reaction, the beaker
was sealed with plastic wrap. Then, the mixture was kept at room temperature
for the glycerol to settle at the bottom of the beaker by gravity.
After the separation was completed, the bottom glycerin layer was
removed and the upper ester layer was moved to a rotary evaporator
to remove the residual ethanol at 80 °C and provide the soybean
oil fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE). The component of the obtained product
was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Agilent
7890A-5975C USA), and the results are shown in Table 4.

2.3 Preparation of Organoclays
All the organoclays were
prepared in aqueous solution in the following way: 50 g of raw Mt
powder was dispersed in 1000 mL of deionized water and stirred at
1000 rpm at 75 °C for 1 h; then, the surfactant (1.0 CEC of the
raw Mt) was added into the previous solution and stirred for another
2 h; the final dispersion was settled at room temperature for 24 h;
then, the supernatant was removed and the precipitate was filtered
with an API medium pressure filter to remove the residual water; the
filter cake was collected, dried at 90 °C for 24 h, milled, and
sieved with a 200 mesh sieve, providing the organoclay. Organoclays
prepared with C16, DC16, and TC16 were named OC16, ODC16, and OTC16,
respectively.

2.4 Preparation
of Clay/FAEE Dispersions
Mt (1.00 g) and organoclays modified
with different surfactants were added into 50 mL of FAEE (concentration
of 0.02 g/mL) and stirred at 1000 rpm and 60 °C for 24 h, and
then the dispersions of clays in FAEE were obtained.

2.5 Characterization of Organoclays
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the clay powders were recorded
by a D8 Focus diffractometer at a current of 40 mA and a voltage of
40 kV with Cu filtered radiation and a scan speed of 1° (2θ)/min.
The patterns were collected with 2θ angle scanning from 1 to
10°. The basal spacing of organoclays was calculated by the Bragg
equation shown in eq 1. 1  

where d is the interlayer space, θ
is the diffraction angle, λ is the wavelength, and n is the reflection order. In our test, the λ of X-ray was 1.5406
Å and n was 1. Before the analysis, XRD samples
were packed in standard sample holders and pressed flat.

Water
contact angle was determined with the static sessile drop method using
a digital camera equipped on a contact angle tester (HARKE-SPCA, Beijing
HARKE Testing Equipment Factory). Before the test, the clay powders
were placed on a glass sheet and pressed flat.

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) curves of the clay powders were obtained using a NETZSCH
STA 409 PC (Bayern, Germany) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and
in a temperature range from 30 to 800 °C in a high-purity Ar
atmosphere.

2.6 Morphology
Study
Clay/FAEE dispersions (50 mL) were added into 100 mL
graduated cylinders and settled for 10 h at 2, 25, and 65 °C,
observing the total and the gel volume variation with time and temperature.
The micrographs of clays dispersed in the FAEE were observed by a
Leica DM4 M microscope. The particle size (diameter) distributions
of clay dispersions were determined using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000
particle size analyzer.

2.7 Temperature-Controlled Rheology Experiment
The steady
shear viscosity test focused on clay/FAEE dispersions was conducted
by a HAAKE MARS60 rheometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Germany)
in the rate scan mode. The rheometer was operated under a plate model
using a C35 1°/Ti rotor with a sample volume of 0.2 mL and a
gap distance of 0.053 mm. The shear rate was controlled from 1000
to 0.1 s–1, and the testing temperatures were 2
and 65 °C.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
3.1.1 XRD
The XRD patterns of raw Mt and organoclays are presented
in Figure 1. The raw
Mt exhibited a basal reflection at 2θ = 5.62°, corresponding
to a basal spacing of 15.69 Å. When modified by cationic surfactants,
the reflections exhibited significant changes. On one hand, with the
increased number of alkyl chains in surfactants, the basal reflections
shifted to smaller angles, indicating the increase in the interlayer
space. The basal reflections of OC16, ODC16, and OTC16 shifted to
2θ = 4.46, 2.09, and 1.76°, respectively, corresponding
to basal spacing values of 19.79, 42.32, and 50.04 Å. According
to previous studies,29 the phenomenon could
be explained by the differences in the molecule size of surfactants
inserted into the Mt layers. The greater the number of alkyl chains,
the bigger the molecule size of the surfactants, and the intercalation
results in a greater interlayer space. On the other hand, the number
of reflections also exhibited an increase with the number of alkyl
chains. For raw Mt and OC16, only the 001 reflection could be observed.
The 002 and 003 reflections of ODC16 emerged at 2θ = 4.22 and
6.33°, corresponding to d values of 20.94 and
13.95 Å (1/2 and 1/3 of the basal spacing, respectively). For
OTC16, the 002, 003, and 004 reflections emerged at 2θ = 3.52,
5.26, and 7.03°, corresponding to d values of
25.12, 16.77, and 12.56 Å (1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 of the basal spacing,
respectively). According to the literature,30−32 it indicated the more ordered internal lattice
of ODC16 and OTC16 caused by the surfactants with multiple alkyl chains.
As the loading of surfactants was constant (1.0 CEC), a greater number
of alkyl chains resulted in a denser and ordered arrangement.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of clay
powders.

3.1.2 Contact Angle
The contact angles of clays with deionized water are shown in Figure 2. The water contact
angle of Mt was 25.61°, which was similar to the result in the
literature,33 indicating the great hydrophilicity
of the raw Mt. The hydrophilicity changed when it was modified with
the quaternary ammonium salt cations. As the number of surfactant
alkyl chains increased, the water contact angle of organoclays exhibited
an increasing trend. The contact angles of OC16, ODC16, and OTC16
increased to 51.04, 74.14, and 88.82°, respectively. It indicated
that the alkyl chain number of surfactants had a great influence on
the clay surface property. The greater the alkyl chain number, the
stronger the hydrophobicity. On one hand, the phenomenon was determined
by the nature of surfactants. The surfactants with more alkyl chains
would exhibit stronger hydrophobicity and their adsorption on the
layer surface would enlarge the water contact angle of organoclays.
On the other hand, with the same addition of surfactants (1.0 CEC),
the denser arrangement of alkyl chains would occupy more area of the
hydrophilic Mt surface, thus resulting in stronger hydrophobicity.

Figure 2 Water contact angles of clays.

3.1.3 Thermal Analyses
The TG curves (Figure 3) reflect the thermal stability of clays. According to the
literature,30,34 the thermal decomposition of
organo-montmorillonite mainly occurred in three regions. The first
tended to occur before 200 °C, corresponding to the mass loss
of adsorbed water. The second one always occurred between 200–500
°C, corresponding to the oxidation and thermal decomposition
of the surfactants. The last mass loss region above 500 °C was
assigned to the dehydroxylation of Mt. In this test, 9.7% of mass
loss was observed in the TG curve of the raw Mt before 200 °C,
corresponding to the evaporation of adsorbed water. The mass losses
of OC16, ODC16, and OTC16 decreased to 3.2, 2.2, and 1.2% before 200
°C,
exhibiting a decreasing tendency with the increasing alkyl chain number.
It indicated that the surfactants intercalated into the interlayer
space and replaced most of the adsorbed water molecules. As the denser
arrangement of DC16 and TC16 alkyl chains would occupy more interlayer
space, thus replacing more water, it resulted in lesser mass loss
before 200 °C than OC16. The initial degradation temperatures
of OC16, ODC16, and OTC16 were 188, 183, and 181 °C, respectively,
exhibiting a decreasing tendency with the increasing alkyl chain number.
Additionally, the mass losses assigned to surfactant decomposition
of OC16, ODC16, and OTC16 were 29.8, 38.8, and 42.8%, respectively,
exhibiting an increasing tendency with the increasing alkyl chain
number. A greater alkyl chain number caused worse thermal stability
of organoclay. Several literature reports30,35 mentioned
that the Mt layers would provide protection for the intercalated surfactant
molecules, slowing down their thermal decomposition. As the greater
alkyl chain number would result in a greater interlayer space of organoclays,
it would be easier to expose the surfactants to the air; thus, they
are easier to be decomposed.

Mt, (b) OC16, (c) ODC16, and (d) OTC16.

3.2 Morphology
3.2.1 Macromorphology
Gel formation of organoclays in base oil plays a necessary role in
controlling the rheological properties of oil-based drilling fluids.36 The gel volumes of Mt and organoclays in FAEE
are shown in Figure 4. The fresh dispersions were homogeneous with a gel volume of 50
mL (0 min). Mt exhibited the fastest sinking in FAEE, resulting in
a rapid decline in the gel volume. After settling for 120 min, the
reduction in the gel volume significantly slowed down and the final
gel volume at 600 min was 11 mL. Compared with Mt, the sedimentation
rates of organoclays in FAEE were significantly slower, showing better
dispersion stability and greater gel volume. OC16 did not sink when
it was left standing for 240 min, exhibiting the best settlement stability,
and the gel volume at 600 min was 42 mL.
ODC16 and OTC16 presented faster sinking and less gel volume than
OC16. ODC16 had a gel volume of 24 mL at 600 min and that of OTC16
was 23 mL. According to the results, the organoclay modified by surfactants
with single 16 carbon alkyl chain exhibited better dispersion in FAEE
than that modified by surfactants with double and triple 16 carbon
alkyl chains. It was in contrast to the results in the literature30 that organo-montmorillonite modified by surfactants
with double 18 carbon alkyl chains exhibited a better dispersion state
in the No. 5 white oil than that modified by surfactants with single
18 carbon alkyl chain. Although the swelling mechanism of organoclay
in organic solvents is still not clearly understood, many literature
reports34,36 pointed out that the dispersion of organoclay
in organic solvents is highly dependent on parameters including the
interaction between the surfactant and solvent, polarity of solvent,
and duration of shearing. In this study, the duration of shearing
was fixed. The base oil FAEE was mainly a mixture of 16 carbon and
18 carbon fatty acid ethyl esters and thus had stronger polarity than
white oil (mixture of saturated alkanes). Compared with DC16 and TC16,
the carbon chain structure of surfactant C16 was closest to that of
FAEE; thus, it was more compatible.
Also, due to the looser arrangement of C16 molecules on the surface
of Mt, a more hydrophilic surface was retained in OC16 than those
in ODC16 and OTC16, prospectively exhibiting a greater interaction
with FAEE molecules.

Figure 4 Gel volumes
of Mt and
organoclays in FAEE within 10 h.

To study the effect of temperature on the
clay dispersions, the samples were settled at 2 and 65 °C for
10 h and the changes of total and gel volumes with temperature were
observed. As shown in Figure 5, the temperature affected both the total and gel volumes
of the clay dispersions. On one hand, the total volumes of dispersions
decreased at 2 °C while they increased at 65 °C. The range
of the total volume with temperature was not affected by the kind
of clay, indicating that it was mainly determined by the nature of
the FAEE. The phenomenon might be explained by the thermal expansion
and cold contraction of FAEE molecules. At 2 °C, the carbon chains
of FAEE molecules shrunk, decreasing the distance between molecules
and resulting in a decrease in the total volume. At 65 °C, the
carbon chains of FAEE molecules were stretched, enlarging the molecule
distance and resulting in an increase in the total volume. On the
other hand, the gel volume, which was mainly dependent on the dispersion
state of clay particles in FAEE, also exhibited a decrease at 2 °C
and an increase at 65 °C. The possible reasons are as follows:
the thermal motion of clay particles at 2 °C weakened, coupled
with the effect of the shrinking FAEE volume, and the diffusion of
clay particles was hindered. Conversely, at 65 °C, both the stronger
particle thermal motion and expanded FAEE volume were beneficial to
the particle diffusion, resulting in a greater gel volume. It could
be observed that the gel volume ranges of ODC16 and OTC16 with temperature
were greater than those of Mt and OC16, indicating the greater impaction
of temperature change on their dispersion state.

volumes of clay/FAEE dispersions

3.2.2 Micromorphology
The
optical micrographs and particle size distributions of the clay dispersions
are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The clays modified with different
surfactants exhibited different microstructures and particle size
distributions when dispersed in FAEE. In the Mt dispersion (Figure 6a), many large particles
were observed to coexist with smaller ones. The particle size also
exhibited a polydispersity. The average particle size was 35.12 μm,
and the biggest ones even exceeded 100 μm. It might exhibit
such behavior because of the strong hydrophilic Mt surface and great
amount of interlayer-adsorbed water, which made it hard for the FAEE
molecules to infiltrate into the gallery to swell Mt particles. As
a result, the dispersion of Mt mainly depended on the mechanical agitation,
which was hard to disperse completely. When modified with surfactants,
the alkyl chain number had a great effect on the microscopic dispersion
state of organoclays. The OC16 was most evenly dispersed (Figure 6b) because of the
better affinity of C16 with FAEE and the polar interaction between
OC16 sheets and FAEE molecules. The particle size of OC16 displayed
a comparatively narrow distribution with an average particle size
of 3.58 μm. The particle size distributions of ODC16 and OTC16
were almost the same, both exhibiting a narrow distribution with average
particle sizes of 6.15 and 6.37 μm, respectively. It indicated
that ODC16 and OTC16 were swollen in FAEE. However, different from
OC16, ODC16 and OTC16 were not uniformly dispersed in FAEE but tended
to aggregate and form a network. It might be due to the lower compatibility
of DC16 and TC16 with FAEE molecules and the less polarity of ODC16
and OTC16 sheets, making it hard for ODC16 and OTC16 to interact with
FAEE molecules.

3.3 Rheological Properties at Different Temperatures
The low
shear rate viscosity (LSRV) and yield stress are the most critical
parameters for the evaluation of the abilities of solid suspension
and wellbore cleaning of drilling fluids. These two rheological properties
are mainly determined by the network strength formed by clay particles,
which would be mainly affected by the clay concentration, the interaction
between clay and the continuous phase, and the concentration of polar
components.4,37,38 In this work,
all the clay concentrations were fixed at 2.0 wt % and no other polar
components existed in the dispersions to study the effect of clay
morphology on LSRV and yield stress variation between 2–65
°C. The apparent viscosity/shear rate behaviors of clay dispersions
at 2 and 65 °C are presented in Figure 8. The pure FAEE exhibited Newtonian-like
flow behaviors at both 2 and 65 °C. When added with clays, all
the dispersions exhibited a shear-thinning behavior at 2 °C,
responding to non-Newtonian flow behaviors deriving from the interaction
between clay particles. With the temperature increased to 65 °C,
the apparent viscosity of the dispersions experienced significant
changes. As with FAEE, dispersion of Mt exhibited a Newtonian-like
flow behavior, indicating the disappearance of particle interaction.
The apparent viscosity values of OC16, ODC16, and OTC16 were almost
identical and maintained a shear-thinning behavior. In deep-water
drilling fluid technology, the change of low shear rate viscosity
with temperature is also one of most the important indicators for
determining flat rheology.18,39,40 Taking the viscosity of dispersions at 0.1 s–1 as an example (Table 5), the viscosity of the OC16 dispersion at 0.1 s–1 was the lowest at 2 °C and the highest at 65 °C and ended
with the smallest viscosity ratio of 2 °C/65 °C (1.57).
As a result, the low shear rate viscosity of OC16 dispersion varied
minimally with temperature, indicating the relatively stable dispersion
state of OC16 in the temperature range of 2–65 °C. However,
the LSRV of other three clay dispersions exhibited a significant change
with the temperature, corresponding to the great effect of temperature
change on their dispersion state. These results were consistent with
those in section 3.2.1.

The shear stress/shear rate behaviors of clay dispersions
at 2 and 65 °C are shown in Figure 9. Based on the rheological data, the Herschel–Bulkley
model was used to determine the yield stress of each sample, as shown
in eq 2. 2

The Herschel–Bulkley model parameters of all the samples are
presented in Table 6. The Herschel–Bulkley model fitted all the experimental results
fairly well (R2 > 0.9). At 2 °C,
the yield stress (τ0) of OC16 dispersion was almost
the same with that of Mt. With the increase in the surfactant’s
alkyl chain number, the yield stress exhibited a significant increase,
indicating the formation of greater network strength by the organoclay
particles. When the temperature increased to 65 °C, the yield
stress values of Mt, ODC16, and OTC16 dispersions decreased to 0.0254,
0.0256, and 0.0372 Pa, respectively, and the ratios at 2 °C were
6.45, 21.95, and 21.47. It indicated that the network formed by clay
particles weakened under 65 °C. The yield stress of the OC16
dispersion was 0.0544 Pa, which is the largest at 65 °C. The
2 °C/65 °C yield stress ratio of the OC16 dispersion was
only 2.92, exhibiting the best temperature stability. Traditional
oil-based drilling fluids are always focusing on the value of yield
stress, determining whether the drilling fluid has sufficient abilities
of solid suspension and wellbore cleaning. However, in deep-water
drilling, the stability of yield stress over a wide temperature range
(always between 4–65 °C) is more important because it
will greatly affect the ECD, the key to determine the success of offshore
drilling operations. Therefore, deep-water drilling is more inclined
to optimize the base slurry (organoclay dispersion) with stable yield
stress with temperature change to ensure the controllability of ECD.
When the yield stress is insufficient to meet the requirements of
solid dispersion and wellbore cleaning, it would be enhanced with
a rheological modifier such as a dimer fatty acid amide.41 The rheological results confirmed that the OC16
dispersion exhibited the best flat rheology property. In comparison,
the LSRV and yield stress of the other three, especially ODC16 and
OTC16 dispersions, exhibited significant temperature sensitivity.

3.4 Temperature Influence
Mechanism
Based on the former results, the relationship between
the morphology and rheological properties of clay dispersions between
2–65 °C was established, as graphically explained in Figure 10. For Mt, the small
interlayer space (no surfactant intercalation) and strong hydrophilic
properties prevented the intercalation of FAEE molecules, thus leading
to a poor expansion and dispersion of the sheets. As a result, big
particle size and small particle amount existed in the Mt dispersions.
At 2 °C, the particles tend to aggregate and form a network,
exhibiting a non-Newtonian flow behavior during the shearing process.
When temperature was increased to 65 °C, the stronger thermal
motion of particles and the expansion of the continuous phase led
to a greater particle spacing, destroying the origin network and exhibiting
a Newtonian-like flow behavior. The organoclays exhibited better swelling
in FAEE than in Mt. However, their dispersion states were greatly
affected by the number of surfactant alkyl chains. The molecular structure
of C16 was close to that of FAEE and thus had higher compatibility.
In addition, the loose arrangement of C16 alkyl chains on the Mt surface
occupied a less hydrophilic area, and thus, the sheets of OC16 exhibited
stronger polarity than the other two organoclays and interacted much
easier with FAEE molecules. As a result, OC16 was highly dispersed
in FAEE, which would not be significantly changed by the thermal motion
of sheets and the volume of FAEE variation caused by temperature changes.
Therefore, temperature was shown to have a lesser effect on the LSRV
and yield stress of OC16/FAEE dispersions. For ODC16 and OTC16, the
greater interlayer space and hydrophobicity allowed the penetration
of FAEE molecules into the galleries and thus could result in swelling
in the base oil.
However, due to the denser arrangement of alkyl chains and the difference
between the molecular structures of surfactant and FAEE, the affinities
of ODC16 and OTC16 to FAEE were limited. At low temperatures, the
swollen sheets tended to aggregate and form a gel structure, with
LSRV and yield stress much greater than those of Mt and OC16 dispersions.
As the temperature increased to 65 °C, the gel structure broke
up due to the dispersion of sheets, which was promoted by the stronger
thermal motion of layers and the expansion of FAEE. The LSRV and yield
stress were close to those of OC16 dispersion due to their similar
dispersion states. As a result, the dispersions of ODC16 and OTC16
were more sensitive to temperature change than that of OC16.

4 Conclusions
In
this work, three kinds of organoclays including OC16, ODC16, and OTC16
were prepared by modifying Mt with different types quaternary ammonium
salt cations. Then, the effects of surfactant types on the interlayer
spacing, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability of organoclays were
characterized by XRD, contact angle, and TGA. The continuous phase
FAEE was prepared by transesterification of transgenic soybean oil
with ethanol. Then, the morphological differences of Mt and organoclays
in FAEE dispersions and their effects on the viscous flow behaviors
in the temperature range of 2–65 °C were studied. For
the raw Mt, the small interlayer space and strong hydrophilicity made
it difficult for FAEE molecules to penetrate the interlayer, preventing
the swelling and dispersion of the sheets. At 2 °C, the big Mt
particles tend to aggregate and form a network, leading to a non-Newtonian
flow behavior and exhibiting yield stress. The network was destroyed
at 65 °C because of the promotion of particle dispersion due
to strong thermal motion and FAEE volume expansion. As a result, the
Mt/FAEE dispersion exhibited a Newtonian-like flow behavior at 65
°C.
When modified with quaternary ammonium salt cations, the swelling
and dispersion of organoclays in FAEE were significantly improved.
However, their dispersion states at different temperatures were greatly
influenced by the alkyl chain number of the surfactants. The OC16
exhibited the most stable dispersion due to the high compatibility
of C16 with FAEE molecules and the greater polar surface. The LSRV
and yield stress of OC16 dispersion varied the least between 2–65
°C, exhibiting the best flat rheology. With the increase in the
alkyl chain number, the affinity of the surfactants and FAEE molecule
weakened. In addition, the denser arrangement of alkyl chains led
to less polar regions on the surface of organoclays. Therefore, the
dispersions of ODC16 and OTC16 were less stable and more sensitive
to temperature changes. At low temperatures, the sheets of ODC16 and
OTC16 tended to aggregate and form a stronger network, thus the LSRV
and yield stress exhibited a significant increase, which were much
greater than those of OC16. As the temperature increased, the network
broke up due to the strong thermal motion and FAEE volume expansion.
As a result, ODC16 and OTC16 exhibited similar dispersion states to
OC16 in FAEE, with their LSRV and yield stress close to those of OC16.
In summary, the higher the degree of affinity between the clay surface
and the continuous phase, the better the dispersion stability and
the less the influence of temperature changes on rheological properties.
