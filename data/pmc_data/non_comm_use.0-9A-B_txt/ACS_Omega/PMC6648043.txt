The radiofrequency (RF) mild hyperthermia
effect sensitized by
biodegradable nanoparticles is a promising approach for therapy and
diagnostics of numerous human diseases including cancer. Herein, we
report the significant enhancement of local destruction of cancer
cells induced by RF hyperthermia in the presence of degraded low-toxic
porous silicon (PSi) nanowires (NWs). Proper selection of RF irradiation
time (10 min), intensity, concentration of PSi NWs, and incubation
time (24 h) decreased cell viability to 10%, which can be potentially
used for cancer treatment. The incubation for 24 h is critical for
degradation of PSi NWs and the formation of silicic acid ions H+ and H3SiO4– in abundance.
The ions drastically change the solution conductivity in the vicinity
of PSi NWs, which enhances the absorption of RF radiation and increases
the hyperthermia effect. The high biodegradability and efficient photoluminescence
of PSi NWs were governed by their mesoporous structure. The average
size of pores was 10 nm, and the sizes of silicon nanocrystals (quantum
dots) were 3–5 nm. Degradation of PSi NWs was observed as a
significant decrease of optical absorbance, photoluminescence, and
Raman signals of PSi NW suspensions after 24 h of incubation. Localization
of PSi NWs at cell membranes revealed by confocal microscopy suggested
that thermal poration of membranes could cause cell death. Thus, efficient
photoluminescence in combination with RF-induced cell membrane breakdown
indicates promising opportunities for theranostic applications of
PSi NWs.

1 Introduction
Application
of radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation is
a promising approach for therapy and diagnostics of numerous human
diseases including cancer. The most common method that uses RF in
oncology is RF ablation, which allows the elimination of malignant
tumors with minimum invasion in contrast to a conventional surgery.1,2 Recently, RF ablation demonstrated one of the best results among
all ablation surgery techniques, that is, prolongation of the overall
survival of patients with highly aggressive tumors (for example, pancreatic
cancer) from 11 to 20–25 months.3 Unresectable tumors can be treated by RF hyperthermia, which usually
goes along with chemotherapy4,5 or gene therapy6 and improves the efficiency of the combined treatment.
In addition to therapeutic modalities, the RF imaging system was recently
applied to an angiography in vivo study.7 The setup used conductivity differences of tissues8 and demonstrated high imaging depth, but its sensitivity
was limited due to the absence of efficient contrast agents.7

In order to improve RF-based methods, several
contrast agents (for
imaging) or RF sensitizers (for therapy) have been proposed.9 Most of them were gold nanoparticles due to their
relatively good biocompatibility10 and
strong interaction with RF electromagnetic fields. Gold nanoparticles
enhanced both hyperthermia9,11 and RF ablation.12 However, the efficiency of such contrasts for
RF methods13 and their possible toxicity
issues14 are still under discussion.

Recently, silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) were proposed as alternative
sensitizers of RF hyperthermia.15 RF treatment
in the mild regime (hyperthermia without ablation) led to significant
suppression of tumor growth due to enhancement by SiNPs absorbed in
the tumor. The mechanisms of RF sensitizing by SiNPs were previously
described in detail.16 In contrast to metal
nanoparticles, SiNPs are highly biocompatible17 and biodegradable.18,19 Porous SiNPs were successfully
utilized for drug delivery20 and sensitizing
of light and ultrasound.21 This allows
multimodal applications of SiNPs desirable for combined anticancer
therapy.

Diagnostic modalities of nanoparticles could be combined
with therapy
in the framework of the so-called theranostic approach. For instance,
nanoparticles can be applied as contrast agents for magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), fluorescent, ultrasonic, and optoacoustic imaging.22 Fluorescent agents are of greatest interest
along with MRI agents.22 Porous SiNPs formed
from porous silicon contain lots of silicon nanocrystals, which can
be described as quantum dots if their diameter is less than 5 nm.23 These quantum dots exhibit efficient photoluminescence
(PL) with a quantum yield of up to 20%.24,25 Emission spectra
partially overlay with the human body transparency window, thus allowing
in vivo fluorescence imaging.26 The sensitivity
of the bioimaging can be dramatically improved by the application
of the time-gated regime.27

Typically,
electrochemical etching of monocrystalline silicon wafers
is utilized to obtain porous SiNPs, but there are some drawbacks.
First of all, there is always a trade in between the size of the pores
and quantum yield of the material. Therefore, the formation of highly
luminescent SiNPs with high drug payloads requires additional chemical
treatment.25,28 The second disadvantage is their
spherical shape, which is vulnerable for phagocytosis29 and therefore exhibits shorter blood circulation time and
worse uptake in tumors by comparison with high-aspect-ratio “worm-like”
nanoparticles.30

From that perspective,
metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) allows
obtaining highly photoluminescent porous silicon nanowires (PSi NWs),
ready for efficient drug loading and delivery in a rapid synthesis
procedure.31,32 Efficient photoluminescence (PL)
of PSi NWs has the same origin and properties as in conventional porous
silicon.33,34 However, PSi NWs have a mesoporous structure
with pore sizes of 2–10 nm well-suitable for drug loading,35 reasonable PL quantum yields, and high aspect
ratios, which are required for successful theranostic applications.

The best policy to avoid unpredictable long-term toxicity of nanoparticles
is to make them biodegradable. High biodegradability of SiNPs is another
advantage for potential theranostic applications, and it was demonstrated
by several research groups.19,26,36,37 The mechanism of biodegradation
is the dissolution of silicon and surface silica into silicic acid
(H4SiO4), which dissociates to H+ and H3SiO4– ions. These
ions are harmless for live systems in reasonable concentrations and
can be easily excreted via renal pathways. Biodegradation of PSi NWs
was also demonstrated in in vitro experiments.38 However, the influence of the biodegradation processes
on RF sensitizing properties of PSi NWs is still unknown. From this
point of view, the present work is aimed to fill this gap and to improve
the efficiency of nanoparticle-assisted RF hyperthermia.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph of the layer of
PSi NWs with a length of about 7 μm and NW diameter in the range
from 100 to 300 nm (see Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information), realized by MACE of the crystalline silicon
(c-Si) wafer.

Figure 1 (a,b) SEM images of PSi NW layer with different magnifications;
(c,d) TEM images of detached PSi NWs with different magnifications.
(e) Size distribution of nc-Si in single PSi NW obtained from the
dark-field TEM image (Figure S3). (f) Pore
size distribution of PSi NWs obtained from the desorption branch of
N2 sorption isotherm.

The SEM image with higher magnification in Figure 1b reveals the porous structure
of the PSi
NWs. Mechanical scratching of PSi NW layers led to detachment of the
NWs from the substrate and partial fracturing of them, which resulted
in the formation of individual nanowires as shown in the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure 1c. The length of the PSi NWs after detachment
was about 1–2 μm, while a small fraction of submicrometer
PSi particles was also present (details in the Supporting Information, Figure S2). Some of the PSi NWs may agglomerate;
however, the typical size of agglomerates does not exceed 1–2
μm according to dynamic light scattering measurements (not shown
here). This does not lead to a significant increase of cytotoxicity
especially when taken into account the biodegradability of PSi NWs. Figure 1d shows the TEM image
of the detailed structure of an individual PSi NW, which consists
of a number of interconnected approximately spherical silicon nanocrystals
(nc-Si) separated by pores. Each nc-Si creates a diffraction pattern,
which was used for visualization of nc-Si in dark-field TEM images
(see Figure S3). This data was used for
the calculation of nc-Si size distribution shown in Figure 1e. The mean diameter dTEM was found to be 4.5 nm with a dispersion
of equal to 3 nm, while the most probable size (maximum of distribution)
of nc-Si was 3 nm. The relatively big dispersion points to the wide
nc-Si size distribution, which means heterogeneity of their properties
and the presence of nonuniform broadening effects. According to BJH
calculations, the porosity of PSi NWs was about 67%, which corresponded
to pore sizes of 3–20 nm (shown in Figure 1f). This potentially allows an efficient
payload of drugs into the pore network of PSi NWs.35

The results of the biodegradation of PSi NWs in H2O
and in PBS at 37 °C are shown in Figure 2. The photographs in Figure 2a present the vials with initial 0.2 mg/mL
suspensions of Si NWs and after 1 day of degradation in H2O and in PBS. The dissolution rate of PSi NWs in H2O (left
vial on each photograph) was found to be too small to exhibit a significant
visible effect after 1 day of incubation. Moreover, PSi NW photoluminescence
(PL) enhancement was observed. At the same time, for PSi NWs incubated
in PBS (right vial on each photograph), the dissolution is clearly
visible; that is, the suspension became almost completely transparent.
The higher dissolution rate of the PSi NWs in PBS can be explained
by the higher ionic strength corresponding to the hydrodynamic activity
of dissolved ions, the concentration of which was 6 orders of magnitude
higher than it is in deionized water.

Figure 2 Biodegradation study of PSi NWs after
1 day of incubation in H2O and PBS. (a) Top row: initial
suspensions, bottom row: after
1 day of incubation at 37 °C; left column: digital photo of the
suspensions, right column: photoluminescence excited by the UV lamp.
(b) PL and (c) Raman spectra of PSi NW suspension before and after
1 day of incubation in H2O and PBS.

The visual PL images of the vials are in good agreement with
PL
spectra presented in Figure 2b. The spectra show 3-fold enhancement of PL after 1 day of
storage in H2O, which can be explained by additional activation
of PL due to the slight oxidation of the PSi NW surface.39 Such oxidation results in passivation of nonradiative
recombination centers, that is, dangling bonds, while the average
size of nc-Si is not significantly affected.40 On the contrary, strong oxidation in PBS leads to the dissolution
of nc-Si themselves, and the PL intensity decreases.

PL of nc-Si
is governed by the quantum confinement effect of excitons;24 therefore, the position of their emission band
is determined by diameters of nc-Si according to the empirical equation 1  where ΔEg is the increase of the effective band gap
due to quantum
confinement by comparison with the bulk silicon band gap Eg0 = 1.12 eV. From the peak position of PL shown in Figure 2b, eq 1 gives the nc-Si sizes dPL close to 3.3 nm, which is in good agreement with TEM
data (Figure 1e). A
decrease in the PL intensity and its blue shift during the PSi NW
incubation in PBS indicate a decrease of the ns-Si size due to the
biodegradation processes.

Similar conclusions can be made from
Raman studies of PSi NWs presented
in Figure 2c. The distinctive
Raman band near 520 cm–1 attributed to scattering
on longitudinal optical phonons in Si41 allows monitoring biodegradation of PSi NWs. The intensity of the
band is proportional to the concentration of silicon, whereas the
band position is governed by the diameter of nc-Si dRS according to the equation41 2  where Δω
is a
Raman band shift from the bulk c-Si position of 520.5 cm–1. The mean diameter dRS was about 5.5
nm for initial nc-Si in PSi NWs, which is slightly higher than the
corresponding value of dPL. This discrepancy
in sizes was attributed to the absence of bigger Si nanocrystals,
which do not contribute to the PL spectrum. Incubation of PSi NWs
in water led to a further shift of the band position and the broadening
of the band corresponding to a slight shrinking of the nc-Si sizes,
while the intensity of the band did not change dramatically. The calculated dRS after 1 day of incubation in water was about
3.3 nm, which is in good agreement with dPL, and indicates also the slight degradation of nc-Si and achievement
of quantum confinement conditions. On the contrary, incubation of
PSi NWs in PBS led to complete vanishing of the Raman Si band that
points to the almost total dissolution of PSi NWs.

The effect
of PSi NW biodegradation on radiofrequency (RF) heating
was investigated using a clinically approved RF apparatus and noncontact
infrared thermometer. Figure 3a shows a relative temperature elevation ΔT, that is, the temperature difference between suspensions of degraded
(after 1 day) and initial PSi NWs during RF heating under the same
conditions, in H2O (blue curve) and PBS (red curve). Raw
temperature dependences are presented in Figure S4.

Figure 3 Relative temperature elevation of PSi NW suspension ΔT, that is, (a) temperature difference between degraded
(after 1 day) and initial PSi NWs during RF heating under the same
conditions. Blue and red curves correspond to incubation in H2O and PBS at 37 °C, respectively. (b) Schematic view
of RF heating mechanism of the initial (left) and partially degraded
after 1 day of incubation (right) PSi NW. Green and yellow circles
represent cations and anions oscillating in the applied RF field,
respectively.

The absence of the dissolution
effect was clearly visible when
incubating PSi NWs in H2O, and the low dissolution rate
of PSi NWs in H2O resulted in a low-temperature difference
below 0.5 K. On the contrary, the high dissolution rate of PSi NWs
in PBS resulted in formation of highly concentrated silicic acid (dissociated
to the ions) and led to a significant increase of the heating rates
of suspensions (0.2 K/s). The process of PSi NW dissolution in aqueous
media with the formation of silicic acid and its dissociation into
ions is described by the equation42 3  

A schematic view of the mechanism of PSi NW heating under
RF irradiation
is shown in Figure 3b. The double-sided arrow displays the oscillations of ions under
the action of the RF field, leading to energy dissipation and Joule
heating of the suspension: green circles are cations (H+), and yellow circles are anions (H3SiO4–). The concentration of ions is higher for the suspension
of partially degraded PSi NWs after 1 day of its incubation in PBS,
which causes greater heating of the suspension in comparison with
the initial ones. In water, the degradation of PSi NWs is slow compared
to that in PBS, and the difference in the heating of the initial suspensions
and after 1 day of incubation is imperceptible. These results are
consistent with the suspension conductivity measurement presented
in the Supporting Information (Figure S5 and Table S1).

Figure 4 shows the
results of in vitro experiments with Hep2 cells exposed to the applied
RF field in the presence of PSi NWs. Figure 4a,b presents fluorescent confocal images
of the cells after 4 and 24 h of incubation with PSi NWs, respectively.
Blue, green, and red colors correspond to cell nuclei, cytoplasm,
and PSi NWs, respectively. Note that the red color of PSi NWs is explained
by their natural label-free PL of quantum-confined excitons in silicon
nanocrystals (see Figure 2). Thus, the efficient PL provides diagnostic modality of
PSi NWs.

Figure 4 In vitro study of PSi NWs. (a,b) Confocal images of PSi NWs incubated
with Hep2 cells for 4 and 24 h, respectively. (c,d) Hep2 viability
vs RF irradiation time and concentration of PSi NWs. The bars show
mean ± SD (n = 4). The levels of significance
between the control and treated groups were set at a probability of
****p < 0.0001.

The relatively large length of PSi NWs (1–2 μm)
partially
prevents them from penetrating through the cell membrane; thus, the
majority of PSi NWs are localized in the vicinity of the membranes
for both 4 and 24 h of incubation. The confocal z-scan image stack
(Figure S6) shows negligible penetration
of PSi NWs through the cell membrane. However, some of PSi NWs may
be internalized in endosomal compartments of cells.43 The endosomal media is usually acidic with low pH, which
may significantly change biodegradation of inorganic nanowires.44 To clarify this point, we investigated biodegradation
of PSi NWs in simulated acidic conditions, that is, an aqueous solution
of citric acid (150 mM) with an equal ionic strength to PBS. The data
are shown in the Supporting Information. Figures S7 and S8 demonstrate huge deceleration of biodegradation in
acidic conditions. So, Figure S7 shows
a slight shift of the Si Raman band, in contrast, to complete vanishing
of the band after degradation in PBS. Figure S8 shows no significant effect (within the margins of errors) of PSi
NW incubation in citric acid solutions on the RF heating rate. Therefore,
the influence of RF activation internalized in the endosomal compartment
of the cells PSi NPs can be considered as negligible.

Figure 4c,d demonstrates
the effect of RF irradiation on cell viability. Blue bars correspond
to the control experiment, that is, cells without PSi NWs. Pink, green,
and red bars correspond to PSi NW concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and
0.2 mg/mL added to cell cultures, respectively. Note that nontoxic
PSi NW concentrations were chosen in this experiment (see the Supporting
Information, Figure S9). RF irradiation
exposure values were 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min (groups of bars—from
left to right). The combined action of RF and PSi NWs after 4 h of
incubation with cells did not significantly influence cell viability
(Figure 4c). The majority
of cells maintained their viability after 5 and 10 min of RF irradiation
independent of PSi NW concentration. That points to the mild regime
of RF treatment, which is potentially applicable to in vivo experiments
and clinical trials. However, longer RF treatment led to significant
temperature elevation and hyperthermia causing cell death and viability
drop down to 10–20%. Thus, sensitizing of the RF field by PSi
NWs does not show any additional effect in in vitro experiments after
4 h of their incubation with cells.

The effect of RF sensitizing
by PSi NWs was observed after 24 h
of incubation. Figure 4d shows strong concentration dependency for cell cultures exposed
to RF irradiation for 10 min. The viability of control cells (without
PSi NWs) was approximately 80%, similar to the case of 4 h of incubation.
Addition of PSi NWs in low concentration (0.05 mg/mL) led to a significant
viability drop to 40%, while the further increase of PSi NW concentration
led to the almost complete destruction of cells (viability was under
15%). With an increase in irradiation times, hyperthermic effects
of RF were predominant, and the difference in cell survival without
and in the presence of PSi NWs was insignificant. Therefore, for successful
application of RF therapy strict conditions for RF intensity and exposure
time, the concentration of PSi NWs and time of incubation (time after
injection of PSi NWs in potential clinical trials) must be fulfilled.
Otherwise, the treatment can be weak to affect any dangerous cancer
cells or too strong to keep healthy cells without PSi NWs alive. However,
the precise application of RF treatment and PSi NWs allows 5-fold
enhancement of cancer cell destruction by comparison with cells without
PSi NWs.

The schematic representation of the influence of PSi
NW biodegradation
on the effectiveness of RF sensitizing and cancer cell destruction
is shown in Figure 5. First, PSi NWs are localized near or on the cell membrane after
4 h of incubation. Small green and yellow circles in the figure are
silicic acid cations and anions, respectively. Silicon nanocrystals
in PSi NWs are quite large and are represented in gray. Thus, slight
degradation of PSi NWs and a small amount of ions lead to slight heating
of the suspension, which is represented as a pink cloud. Such low
heat does not lead to cell destruction. Then, after 24 h of incubation,
the PSi NWs are attached to the cell membrane. Biodegradation of PSi
NWs during 24 h incubation with cells leads to a decrease in the size
of silicon nanocrystals and the formation and dissociation of silicic
acid. A large number of ions, in turn, lead to large heating of the
suspensions (represented as a red cloud) due to the release of Joule
heat when exposed to an RF field. Both measurement and calculation
of local ion concentration are difficult to perform; however, overall
concentration of ions can be estimated as less than 15 mM for the
completely degraded 0.2 mg/mL PSi NW suspension. The fracturing of
the cell’s membrane in the vicinity of “hot”
PSi NWs is shown as breaks of the black line.

PSi NWs. Reddish glow near PSi NWs represents RF-induced heating.
Small green and yellow circles are silicic acid cations and anions,
respectively. PSi NWs on the left represent initial particles with
thick silicon walls, and PSi NWs in the vicinity of the cytoplasmic
membrane (colored black) represent highly biodegraded particles with
thin silicon walls after 24 h of incubation. The fracturing of the
membrane in the vicinity of “hot” PSi NWs is shown as
breaks of the black line.

3 Conclusions
It has been shown that radiofrequency
hyperthermia sensitized with
porous silicon nanowires can be significantly improved by fine-tuning
the processing parameters, including the radiofrequency exposure time,
intensity, concentration of nanoparticles in cell cultures, and incubation
time. The mechanism of the improvement is based on the formation of
silicic acid ions during the nanowire biodegradation process in the
cellular medium. These ions change the electrolytic properties of
PSi NW suspensions, which in turn lead to higher Joule heating and
temperature increase under RF radiation followed by cell death. Localization
of the silicon nanowires in the vicinity of the cell membranes was
demonstrated by confocal microscopy facilitated by intrinsic photoluminescence
of silicon quantum dots inside the nanowires. Thus, the combination
of radiofrequency thermal therapy sensitized by PSi NWs and photoluminescent
properties opens prospects to their use in clinical anticancer theranostics.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Porous Silicon
Nanowires
PSi NWs were obtained by MACE of a highly doped
(100)-oriented
single-crystalline silicon wafer (0.001 Ω cm). At the first
step, the Si wafer was immersed in a mixture of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 5 M HF in a volume ratio of 1:1 for 15 s. As a result, Ag nanoparticles
were sedimented on the surface of the Si wafer. Then the Si wafer
was placed into a mixture of 5 M HF and 30% H2O2 in a volume ratio of 10:1 for 1 h. The layer of PSi NWs occurred
because of MACE. Then the samples were rinsed three times with water
and then for 10 min in 50% HNO3 to remove Ag. Then the
samples were rinsed again three times in water and dried at 50 °C
in air. The resulting PSi NW layer was scrubbed from the surface,
and suspensions with a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL were made in H2O, PBS, and monohydrated citric acid (150 mM, pH = 2). The
necessary amount of PSi NWs was weighed with 0.05 mg accuracy before
the formation of suspensions.

4.2 Characterization
of Porous Silicon Nanowires
SEM images were obtained by means
of a field emission scanning
electron microscope (Carl Zeiss ULTRA 55 FE-SEM) operated at an acceleration
voltage of 10 kV. TEM images were obtained with an LEO 912 AB Omega
transmission electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) operated
at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Size distributions (in Figure 1e–g) were
calculated from a TEM image using ImageJ software. The image was modified
by contrast enhancement in GIMP software, and then dark/bright spots
corresponding to pores/crystallites were outlined and fitted by ellipses.
Each ellipse gave us two values, that is, major and minor axes, which
were both used for the calculation of pore/crystallite diameter distribution
(Figure 1g) or used
separately for calculations of length and width of detached PSi NWs,
respectively (Figures S1 and S2). For the
latter, only the nonspherical particles were taken into account.

Backscattered Raman spectra were measured using a Horiba HR 800 micro-Raman
spectrometer under excitation by the 6 mW He–Ne laser (wavelength
632.8 nm). The spectral resolution was 0.5 cm–1.
PL of PSi NWs was measured by a SOLAR TII MS 750 spectrometer equipped
by a CCD camera with a Si-based Hamamatsu HS 101H-HR matrix. PL was
excited by a He–Cd laser with a wavelength of 325 nm. The pore
sizes, surface area, and pore volumes were determined with N2 adsorption/desorption (Quantachrome NOVA 4200e, Quantachrome Instruments).
The surface area was calculated using the BET theory (Brunauer, Emmett,
and Teller) from the adsorption branch,45 and the pore size distribution was calculated from the desorption
branch using the BJH theory (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda).46

4.3 Heating of PSi NW Suspensions
in RF Field
For heating of PSi NW suspensions, a clinically
approved RF generator
“MedTeKo UHF60” was used. The frequency was 27.12 ±
0.16 MHz. The power of the RF source was 60 W, which corresponds to
a power density of 1.5 W/cm3. A cuvette with a suspension
was placed between round electrodes with a diameter of 36 ± 5
mm, and the distance between them was 4 cm. The temperature was measured
by a fast noncontact infrared thermometer with 0.2 °C accuracy.
The electrical conductivity of the solutions was measured by using
an HP 4192A LF impedance analyzer in the range of 5 kHz to 13 MHz.

4.4 In Vitro Experiments
Hep2 cells were
routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, PanEco, Russia) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco, USA) and 1% antibiotic (gentamycin, DHF OAO, Russia) in 75
cm2 flasks in a CO2 incubator. Before the experiment,
a total of 104 cells per well in 100 μL of culture
medium were seeded in a 96 well plate and were allowed to attach for
20 h. Then DMEM was replaced with L-15 (Sigma, US) media, which contained
the predetermined concentrations of PSi NWs, and the cells were incubated
for 4 or 24 h to allow PSi NWs to dissolve and change the heating
rate. The necessary amount of PSi NWs was added to L-15 media to reach
a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL.

Since the RF generator was too
large to be placed into the incubator, a different chamber was devised
where the 96 well plate and RF electrodes below and above the plate
were placed. The temperature inside the chamber was kept at 37 °C.
The L-15 media was needed to ensure the constant pH value in the cell
media in the absence of CO2 in the chamber. The cells were
irradiated for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min with 40 W power, after which
L-15 was replaced with fresh DMEM and cells were additionally incubated
for 8 h before the viability measurement. The measurement was done
with a CellTiter Glo (Promega) assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The obtained results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni multiple comparison correction.

The same cell
line was used for confocal imaging. After addition
of PSi NWs, 3 μg/mL of Calcein-AM purchased from Sigma and 5
μg/mL of bisbenzimide H 33342 (Hoechst) purchased from Calbiochem
were added and incubated for 1 h in the presence of 5% CO2. Confocal images were obtained by means of a Leica confocal microscope.
Excitation was provided by laser diodes with wavelengths of 405 and
488 nm. Emission was measured at 460 and 550 nm.
