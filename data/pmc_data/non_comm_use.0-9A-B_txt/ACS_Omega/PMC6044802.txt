Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent
glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) was identified and cloned from thermophilic filamentous fungi Talaromyces emersonii using the homology cloning
method. A direct electron transfer bioanode composed of T. emersonii FAD-GDH and a single-walled carbon nanotube
was produced. Enzymes from thermophilic microorganisms generally have
low activity at ambient temperature; however, the T.
emersonii FAD-GDH bioanode exhibits a large anodic
current due to the enzymatic reaction (1 mA cm–2) at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the T. emersonii FAD-GDH bioanode worked at 70 °C for 12 h. This is the first
report of a bioanode with a glucose-catalyzing enzyme from a thermophilic
microorganism that has potential for biosensor and biofuel cell applications.
In addition, we demonstrate how the glycoforms of T.
emersonii FAD-GDHs expressed by various hosts influence
the electrochemical properties of the bioanode.

Introduction
Thermostable enzymes
from thermophilic microorganisms display not
only heat and chemical resistance but also excellent long-term storage
tolerance. The application of thermostable enzymes is promising and
has been reported by some researchers.1−6 However, the application of a thermostable enzyme to catalyze glucose,
which is one of the most important substrates in the fields of medicine,
biochemistry, environmental science, fermentation, and agriculture,
has not yet been reported. Talaromyces emersonii is a thermophilic filamentous fungus and is a natural saprophyte
that inhabits soil and compost heaps. Highly specific thermostable
enzyme cocktails produced by T. emersonii have been applied to the baking of bread.7 However, T. emersonii does not secrete
a glucose-catalyzing enzyme under conventional cultivation conditions.
We have identified and cloned flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent
glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from T. emersonii using the homology cloning method.8

Oxygen-insensitive FAD-GDH has attracted considerable attention
over the past several years, and there are increasing reports of biosensors
and biofuel cells that employ FAD-GDH.9−24 FAD-GDH used in such biodevices is typically isolated from Aspergillus,9−20Glomerella,21,22 or Burkholderia;23,24 however, FAD-GDHs from these sources exhibit
inadequate thermal stability and substrate selectivity, and they give
rise to several practical problems. Consequently, an FAD-GDH suitable
for biodevice applications such as biosensors and biofuel cells has
not yet been identified. In this article, we present the characterization
of a thermophilic T. emersonii FAD-GDH
bioanode for biosensor and biofuel cell applications.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of T. emersonii FAD-GDHs Expressed
by Various Hosts
Recombinant T. emersonii FAD-GDHs were expressed in the bacterium Escherichia
coli (EcGDH) and the
yeasts Pichia pastoris (PpGDH) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScGDH) because the collection of FAD-GDHs from the original
host is thought to be difficult. The recombinant proteins expressed
in the yeasts have different glycoforms; thus, the FAD-GDHs have different
molecular masses (EcGDH: 60 kDa; PpGDH: 90–150 kDa; ScGDH: 110–250 kDa).
The FAD-GDHs used in this research are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information, and the results of sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) separation
are shown in Figure 1. Recombinant proteins expressed by the three hosts differ in their
glycan chain amount, and their glycan chain lengths increase in the
order ScGDH > PpGDH > EcGDH. Expression in prokaryotic E. coli, which cannot glycosylate proteins, is equivalent to removal of
the glycosyl groups. The molecular mass of GDH without glycan chains
is 60 kDa, which is the same as the molecular mass of EcGDH. The apparent mass of the glycan chains in PpGDH and ScGDH is between 50–183% and 83–317%
that of the peptide chain, respectively. Glycan chains are mainly
composed of high mannose-type oligosaccharides that contain mannose
and N-acetylglucosamine.25,26 These oligosaccharide chains connect to asparagine, threonine, and
serine residues on the surface of GDH. The difference in the amount
of glycan chains in PpGDH and ScGDH is attributed to S. cerevisiae-expressed proteins often being hyperglycosylated, where each oligosaccharide
can contain more than 50 mannose residues.25 The judicious choice of hosts is thus an unavoidable step in the
utilization of enzymes by homology cloning.

Characterization of Bioanode with T. emersonii FAD-GDHs
The electrochemical
performance of a bioanode
is largely governed by the efficiency of electron transfer between
the enzyme and the electrode (electron collector). The crystal structure
of FAD-GDH from Aspergillus flavus has
recently been solved:27 The FAD cofactor
in GDH is tightly and deeply embedded within a structurally rigid
glycoprotein shell. Adopting the configuration for electron transfer
is thought to be an unavoidable task in FAD-GDH. There are two approaches
for electron transfer to occur. One is to utilize electron transfer
mediators, which are often small and mobile agents such as hexacyanoferrate(III),13 octacyanomalybdate,12 osmium complexes,10,21,22 phenothiazine,11,15 or menadione.14 The problem with mediated electron transfer (MET) is that
the mediators can leach out, reducing the sensitivity of this process
and causing poisoning problems. Even if immobilized and polymeric
mediators are adopted, the complicated process, which includes the
preparation of an accommodating polymer matrix and the need to fine
tune the hydrophobic mediator and hydrophilic enzyme, is not avoidable.
The other approach is direct electron transfer (DET). We have previously
reported that DET occurs between a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)
and FAD-GDH from A. oryzae, the amino
acid sequence of which perfectly corresponds to that of A. flavus FAD-GDH.9 Therefore,
DET is expected to take place with the fabricated T.
emersonii FAD-GDH bioanodes. To clearly evaluate the
utility of these FAD-GDHs, a simple layer-by-layer process based on
a SWNT and a plasma-polymerized thin film (PPF)28,29 was adopted, as shown in Figure 2. The DET electrode has a sandwich-like structure of
PPF/GDH/SWNT/PPF/Au. The first PPF layer on the Au electrode acts
as a scaffold for the formation of the SWNT layer. A SWNT layer cannot
be obtained without the PPF layer being there first. The anionic surfactant
sodium cholate disrupts the SWNT bundles into individual SWNT molecules. Figure 2A shows an atomic
force microscopy (AFM) image of the surface of the SWNT layer (SWNT/PPF/Au)
and shows that the SWNT network is formed by unbundled SWNT molecules.29Figure 2B shows an AFM image of the GDH immobilized surface (PPF/GDH/SWNT/PPF/Au).
As can be seen, GDH percolates into the SWNT and forms a SWNT–GDH
complex, probably because the protein itself aids in stabilizing a
SWNT dispersion.

Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of bioanodes prepared with T. emersonii FAD-GDH expressed in three hosts (EcGDH, PpGDH, and ScGDH)
at 20 °C are shown in Figure 3A. Glucose concentration vs current plots using the
CV data are shown in Figure S1. The glucose-concentration-dependent
current (GCDC) output due to the increase in the polarized potential
increases steeply, and the oxidative current starts at around +0.1
V (onset potential). DET between FAD-GDH and a SWNT is represented
by 1   2  FAD-GDH has only one enzyme-catalytic
pathway
(eqs 1 and 2). The GCDC at +0.4–0.8 V is not due to hydrogen peroxide
because oxygen-insensitive FAD-GDH does not produce hydrogen peroxide.
Therefore, the observation of a large GCDC at +0.4–0.8 V is
evidence of DET between FAD-GDH and the SWNT. A quantum tunneling
current due to an overpotential is the reason that GCDC did not appear
at −0.45 V (redox potential of FAD) but did appear at +0.4–0.8
V.9

Figure 3 (A) CV profiles for the T. emersonii FAD-GDH anodes at 20 °C. The glucose
concentration was 48 mM.
The dashed line represents the background current. Sweep rate: 50
mV s–1. The electrolyte was pH 7.4 phosphate buffer
solution. (B) Speculative DET model between FAD-GDH and SWNT. The
diameter of the SWNT is 1.2 nm. The three-dimensional structure of T. emersonii FAD-GDH was modeled based on the structure
of A. flavus FAD-GDH27 using the SWISS-MODEL server.30

The entire sequence of T. emersonii FAD-GDH is different from that of A. flavus FAD-GDH (64.2% sequence identity). However,
both the structure and
size of T. emersonii FAD-GDH were almost
the same as those of A. flavus FAD-GDH,
with a global model quality estimation score of 0.76, which suggests
that the modeled structure is highly reliable. Three-dimensional structure
modeling of T. emersonii FAD-GDH was
performed based on the structure of A. flavus FAD-GDH27 using the SWISS-MODEL server.30 The overall FAD-GDH molecule is a 4.5 ×
5.6 × 7.8 nm3 globular structure. FAD is positioned
1.4 nm from the surface. A feasible scheme for this involves the side
wall of the SWNT being plugged into the groove of FAD-GDH, as shown
in Figure 3B, where
the SWNT axis is embedded in the surface of the electrode and FAD-GDH
has a groove into which a 1.2 nm diameter individual SWNT can enter.
The individual SWNT can thus be close to a distance of 1.0 nm from
the FAD positioned at the bottom of the groove in Figure 3B. We think that there is no
possibility that the SWNT “docking” to FAD-GDH will
block the substrate’s access. There is space for the substrate
(glucose) to gain access because a large GCDC is observed. Also, there
is no possibility that the glycan shell will act like a spacer because
the GCDC of the bioanode with a glycan-chain-rich enzyme is much larger
than that using an enzyme with no glycan chain. Therefore, it is feasible
that the current at +0.4–0.8 V is a tunneling current from
FAD.

The markedly larger response of the PpGDH glycoprotein
anode than that of the EcGDH deglycosylated protein
is contrary to our expectation because (i) the activity of EcGDH is larger than that of PpGDH (Table S1) and (ii) the common strategy for MET
is deglycosylation in order to shorten the distance between the electrode
and the FAD cofactor in GDH.10,11,22 This suggests that the strategy for controlling the glycan chain
is different between DET and MET. It is possible that one role of
the glycan chains is to stabilize the tertiary structure of the protein.
The EcGDH deglycoprotein is less robust than the PpGDH glycoprotein; thus, EcGDH in close
proximity to a SWNT may unfold and lose its activity. Conversely,
the response of the ScGDH anode is markedly smaller
than that of the PpGDH anode, possibly due to there
being fewer enzymes undergoing DET on the ScGDH anode
than on the PpGDH electrode because the thicker glycan
shell on ScGDH prevents the SWNT from being in close
proximity to the FAD cofactor.

Biofuel Cell
Next,
the performance of the T. emersonii FAD-GDH bioanode was tested in a biofuel
cell. A platinum electrode was used as the cathode to eliminate limitations
from the cathode. Figure 4A shows the polarization curve and power output of a biofuel
cell constructed from a PpGDH anode. The PpGDH anode can function at a high temperature (70 °C).
Furthermore, it works continuously for 12 h, as shown in Figure S2. Tsujimura et al.10 demonstrated that support by a hydrogel/mesoporous carbon
matrix stabilizes the FAD-GDH structure, allowing functionality at
temperatures up to 55 °C to be achieved with a typical FAD-GDH
bioanode. There is no effect of having a matrix support with the layer-by-layer
immobilization procedure used in the present work. Therefore, this
is typical of a thermostable enzyme from a thermophilic microorganism.
If this system is combined with a biocathode that has a thermostable
enzyme,1 then a biofuel cell with long-term
stability and high temperature resistance would be realized.

Figure 4 (A) Polarization
curve (black dots) and output power (blue dots)
of a biofuel cell with the T. emersonii FAD-GDH (PpGDH) anode at 70 °C. Platinum wire
was used as the cathode. (B) Maximum output power of bioanodes with T. emersonii FAD-GDH expressed by various hosts as
a function of temperature. The glucose concentration was 19 mM. The
electrolyte was pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution.

Figure 4B
shows
the maximum output power of T. emersonii FAD-GDHs from various hosts as a function of temperature. The output
power of the PpGDH bioanode is larger than that of
the EcGDH bioanode at all temperatures, which corresponds
to the CV data in Figure 3A. For the PpGDH bioanode, a higher temperature
results in a higher output power. The output power vs temperature
plot of the PpGDH anode is similar to the enzymatic
activity vs temperature plot for free PpGDH.8 In contrast, the output power of the EcGDH bioanode decreased when the temperature surpassed
40 °C. The output power vs temperature plot for the EcGDH anode is different from the enzymatic activity vs temperature
plot for free EcGDH, where the activity increased
up to 60 °C. The fragility of the tertiary structure in the EcGDH/SWNT complex is consistent with the CV data for the EcGDH/SWNT bioanode in Figure 3A.

For the ScGDH bioanode,
although the output is
smaller than that for the PpGDH anode, it increased
with the temperature, which suggests that the glycan chains prevent
the enzyme from unfolding and embedding in the SWNT under harsh conditions
such as heating. PpGDH contains a suitable number
of glycan chains, which allows DET to occur without unfolding. However,
the thermostability of PpGDH is attributed not only
to the presence of glycan chains but also to its sequence. This is
supported by the decrease in the output power of the bioanode using
normal FAD-GDH that has glycan chains when the temperature surpassed
40 °C. Thus, the output power vs temperature profile for the
glycosylated FAD-GDH anode from a nonthermophilic microorganism was
similar to that for the EcGDH anode. It is thus concluded
that PpGDH contains a suitable number of glycan chains,
which allows the SWNT to closely approach FAD without PpGDH unfolding.

Biosensor
The performance of the PpGDH anode as a biosensor was evaluated. Amperometric measurements
at a fixed potential are widely used to evaluate and analyze the performance
of PpGDH anodes as a glucose biosensor. Figure 5A shows the steady-state
amperometric response of the PpGDH anode at +0.6
V vs Ag/AgCl at 20 °C. The current at +0.6 V is available for
time-based measurement with a fixed potential. A sequential increase
in the electrochemical signal with the increase of the glucose concentration
at regular intervals is observed, and the glucose concentration range
evaluated covers the physiological range. The response time was 6
s. The detection characteristics at very low concentrations (5–35
μM) are good, and the detection limit (signal/noise ratio =
2) was 5 μM (upper inset of Figure 5A). The effects of interfering compounds
such as ascorbic acid and uric acid on the sensing characteristics
are negligible (bottom inset of Figure 5A), which suggests that the PpGDH
electrode can be used with physiological samples.

Figure 5 (A) Time–current
response of the PpGDH
anode with the sequential addition of glucose at concentrations of
0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 mM. The temperature was set at 20
°C. Upper inset: Time–current response for sequential
glucose additions at concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 mM. Bottom
inset: Effect of an interfering species [0.1 mM ascorbic acid (AA);
0.1 mM uric acid (UA)] on the response of the PpGDH
anode. The concentrations of glucose (G) were 1 and 2 mM, sequentially.
The polarization potential was +0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl with a pH 7.4 electrolyte
of 20 mM phosphate buffer solution. (B) Calibration plot for glucose
response using the data in panel A. The sensitivity of the electrode
was 10 μA mM–1 cm–2 (r = 0.99 in the linear range of 0.005–27 mM). Upper
inset: Calibration plot for a very low concentration range. Lower
inset: Lineweaver–Burk plot (Imax = 0.43 mA cm–2, KMapp = 22 mM) generated using eq 3.

Figure 5B
shows
a plot of current vs glucose concentration based on the data from Figure 5A. Table S2 shows the characteristics and performance of the
biosensors with FAD-GDH from a thermophilic microorganism compared
with those for other FAD-GDHs from nonthermophilic counterparts. The
sensitivity determined from the slope for the PpGDH
bioanode was 10 μA mM–1 cm–2 (r = 0.98 in the linear range of 0.005–26
mM). It is significant that the biosensor with a thermophilic T. emersonii FAD-GDH bioanode can work at ambient
temperature, similar to a normal FAD-GDH bioanode. It is also noteworthy
that a wider dynamic range, from the detection limit to a glucose
concentration indicative of diabetes, was observed compared to that
of other FAD-GDH biosensors, which is a unique characteristic of biosensors
with a thermophilic T. emersonii FAD-GDH
anode (upper inset of Figure 5B). Deviation from linearity is observed at high (>30 mM)
glucose concentrations, a typical characteristic of the Michaelis–Menten
model. This is a reaction-controlled step and can thus be analyzed
using the Michaelis–Menten model. The bottom inset of Figure 5B shows a Lineweaver–Burk
plot, from which the apparent Michaelis–Menten activity (Kmapp) can be calculated to provide an indication of the enzyme–substrate
kinetics of the biosensor 3  where I is the steady-state
current, Imax is the maximum current under
stationary substrate conditions, Kmapp denotes the apparent Michaelis
constant, and C is the glucose concentration. Imax and Kmapp were obtained by extrapolation
of the plot. The large Imax (0.43 mA cm–2) is indicative of a highly effective electronic contact. Kmapp for immobilized PpGDH was estimated to be 22 mM,
which is significantly smaller than that for PpGDH
in solution (Km = 337 mM). The operational
stability and storage stability were confirmed. A current response
greater than 90% was retained for 12 h. The response was retained
over the period of 7 days by storing at room temperature. The results
demonstrate several advantages of this electrode: (i) PpGDH is suitable for use in biosensor applications, despite its low
affinity toward the substrate, i.e., large Km; (ii) this low affinity toward the substrate means that a
wide sensing dynamic range is obtained without the need to control
diffusion, such as with a membrane; and (iii) despite being an enzyme
from a thermophilic microorganism, PpGDH can be used
at ambient temperature.

Conclusions
We have reported a bioanode
with thermophilic filamentous fungi T. emersonii FAD-GDH for biosensor and biofuel cell
applications. T. emersonii FAD-GDH
was expressed in the bacterium E. coli and yeasts P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae and was obtained in different glycoforms.
Although enzymes from thermophilic microorganisms typically have low
activity at lower temperature, GCDC at an electrode incorporating
a T. emersonii FAD-GDH anode was observed.
The T. emersonii FAD-GDH (PpGDH) bioanode also functioned at 70 °C for 12 h. It is possible
that having a suitable amount of glycan chains at the FAD-GDH interface
prevents electron transfer between FAD and the SWNT from being disturbed
while also preventing denaturation of the enzyme at high temperature.
This is the first report that a bioanode with a glucose-catalyzing
enzyme from a thermophilic microorganism can be applied to biosensors
and biofuel cells.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Distilled water, potassium dihydrogen
phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, d-glucose, l-ascorbic acid, uric acid, acetonitrile, and anionic surfactant sodium
cholate (SC) were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. (Tokyo,
Japan). Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT; 1.2–1.7 nm in
diameter, 0.5 mm average length, Super Pure Tubes) were purchased from Nanointegris Inc. (Boisbrin,
Canada). FAD-GDH (EC 1.1.5.9) from thermophilic T.
emersonii was identified by our group.8 Recombinant T. emersonii FAD-GDHs were expressed by the bacterium E. coli and yeasts P. pastoris(8) and S. cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae INVSc1 strain
and pYES2 expression vector were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
(Waltham, USA). In both yeast expression systems, the α-factor
secretion signal was fused to FAD-GDH, and FAD-GDH was secreted into
the culture media. FAD-GDH was purified by methods from our group.8

Electrode Preparation
The electrochemical
device as
a working electrode was fabricated using a layer-by-layer process.
The device was formed on sputtered Au. The width of the opening for
the working electrode was 9 mm2. An ULVAC VEP-1000 plasma
generator was used to deposit a 2 nm thick acetonitrile PPF layer
onto Au. A SWNT/sodium cholate solution (1.5 mg mL–1 and 20 mg mL–1, respectively) was dropped onto
the PPF surface and dried in a vacuum oven. The thickness of the resulting
sorted SWNT film was ca. 120 nm. Subsequently, the SWNT adsorbed surface
was treated by acetonitrile plasma using the following parameters:
power, 100 W; flow rate, 15 mL min–1; pressure,
0.6 Pa; and exposure time, 30 s (thickness < 1 nm). The role of
PPF is surface modification and then layer formation (polymerization).
The enzyme solution (3–10 mL) was then added by dropping an
aliquot of enzyme in phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) onto the film.
All enzyme solutions for drop-casting contain 100 units. One hour
later, the device was washed with water. Finally, the enzyme-adsorbed
surface was overcoated with a 6 nm thick acetonitrile PPF layer (second
layer). The deposition parameters were as follows: power; 150 W, pressure;
0.6 Pa, and exposure time; 150 s. The devices were stored in a refrigerator
at 4 °C until use.

Measurements
AFM was conducted in
tapping mode in an
air atmosphere using a NanoScope V Dimension Icon stage system produced
by Bruker AXS GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany). The scanning rate was 0.33–1.0
Hz. Electrochemical measurements were performed with an electrochemical
analyzer (ALS Instruments, 701A, West Lafayette, IN) using a three-electrode
configuration. Reference (Ag/AgCl, RE-1C) and counter (platinum wire,
cathode) electrodes were purchased from Bioanalytical Systems Inc.
Electrochemical measurements were conducted in a 5 mL vessel at ambient
temperature (20 °C) using phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) as
the supporting electrolyte. To prepare samples at designated concentrations,
stock glucose solutions of 2.5, 25, or 250 mM were successively added.
