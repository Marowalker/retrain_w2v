Lithium–sulfur (Li–S)
batteries have been earning
significant attention because of their high energy density and cost
efficiency. Albeit these outstanding qualities, the polysulfide shuttling
effect and low electrical conductivity of the sulfur active material
in this battery chemistry results in poor cycling performance. In
an attempt to overcome these problems, a hybrid structure of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene
sulfonate) and reduced graphene oxide was developed and coated on
the surface of a conventional separator using air-controlled electrospray.
Implementing these coated separators in Li–S batteries led
to lower polarization and stymied the polysulfide shuttling effect
through the combining effects of electrostatic, physical, and chemical
interactions. Our results reveal that the capacity and rate capacity
are drastically improved via coating the separator, leading to more
than twice the capacity of over 800 mA h g–1 after
100 cycles at 0.5 C rate, when it is compared to those with the pristine
separator. Overall, this hybrid coating material shows great promise
in enhancing the current Li–S battery technology.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, development of electric vehicles and smart grids
has been on the rise. To accommodate such high-power requiring inventions,
energy-storage devices with high energy densities are utmost necessary.1,2 Conventional lithium-ion batteries have been able to accomplish
great success in the energy-storage sector, but they are still not
sufficient to meet the power demands of electric vehicles and grid-scale
applications.1,3,4 Hence,
many groups have attempted to study different battery chemistries,
and lithium–sulfur batteries (Li–S) are rising as one
of the next-generation energy-storage devices.

Lithium–sulfur
(Li–S) batteries have been attracting
intense attention because of its high theoretical capacity (1675 mA
h g–1) and energy density (2600 W h kg–1). In addition, this battery system utilizes sulfur as the active
material, which is nontoxic and abundant.5−8 Despite these striking advantages,
there are some limitations to this technology that remain unsolved.
First, sulfur is electrically insulating, which causes high cell polarization
and under-utilization of active materials.7,8 Second,
the polysulfide shuttle effect, which is caused by the dissolution
of intermediate lithium polysulfide species in the electrolyte leads
to irreversible loss of sulfur, resulting in rapid capacity fading
and poor Coulombic efficiency of the cells.5,7,9 Third, the huge volume expansion of sulfur
during the repeated charging/discharging processes disrupts the structural
integrity of the electrodes, which leads to poor electrical contact
with the conductive additives and current collectors.10

Many efforts have been devoted to addressing these
challenging
issues in Li–S batteries by developing and applying multiple
types of porous nanostructured sulfur electrodes.8,10 Multidimensional
carbon/sulfur composites based on carbon nanofiber web structures,11−13 carbon nanotubes,14−17 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets18−20 have been created
as a mainstream approach because of their high specific surface area
and electrical conductivity. These innovative strategies involving
composite materials not only improve the reaction kinetics but also
alleviate the degree of polysulfide migration by localizing the sulfur
particles in the cathode compartment of the cell. However, adding
such an inactive carbon material leads to an overall lower energy
density of the cell. In addition, fabricating and processing nanostructured
electrode materials can be time-consuming and difficult as it most
often requires multiple steps.4,9,21

Utilizing coated separators in Li–S batteries has been
sought
out as a potential solution.6,9,22−27 The Manthiram group has demonstrated that the highly conductive
carbon layers on the separator suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect
through physical trapping and provide enhanced conductivity by acting
as an additional current collector, which improves the electrochemical
performance.22 However, the weak adsorption
between carbon and polysulfides induces problems with long-term capturing
abilities, leading to a limited cycling stability.24,28 As a result, to reinforce the chemical interaction with polysulfides,
polar materials such as graphene oxide,28,29 inorganic
oxide material,30,31 metal–organic framework,32 conducting polymer,33 and boron-nitride nanosheets34 have been
investigated as coating materials. Albeit such progress in polysulfide
chemisorption on polar surfaces, further investigations on coated
separators are still needed because the functional groups reduce the
electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is crucial to design an appropriate
structure and material for coated separators that are highly conductive
in an effective manner for suppressing the polysulfide shuttle effect.
Recently, Cui et al. have conducted studies on applying conducting
polymers to Li–S cathodes. The polar heteroatoms in these polymer
shells had strong interactions with polysulfides to form chemical
bonds, preventing polysulfide dissolution.35,36 The resulting Li–S battery performances indicated that the
mesoporous carbon/sulfur composite coating layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) turned out to be superior over other conducting
polymers. Despite this fact, an additional augmentation to increase
the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS along with the physical support could
undoubtedly improve the performance of Li–S batteries even
further.

Herein, we propose a facile strategy to uniformly coat
the surface
of the separator with hybrid rGO–PEDOT:PSS structures. Through
the means of air-controlled electrospraying, rGO–PEDOT:PSS
can be coated not only uniformly but also swiftly on a designated
substrate. By applying rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separators to Li–S
batteries, prominent benefits can be achieved. First, the conductive
coating layer promotes electron transfer, which leads to low polarization
and fast redox reaction kinetics. Second, the polar nature of PEDOT:PSS
induces chemical interactions with polysulfides, and the chemical
adsorption of polysulfide species onto PEDOT:PSS hampers the redox
shuttle effect. Third, the well-developed layer structure of rGO–PEDOT:PSS
provides physical trapping sites for polysulfide, which in turn mitigates
the polysulfide shuttling effect. By utilizing this method, we were
able to achieve improved cycling performances for Li–S batteries
through the synergistic effects of rGO and PEDOT:PSS.

2 Results and Discussion
The rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separator
was prepared via a facile
air-controlled electrospray method, which deposits the material of
interest on a designated substrate through a high-speed air stream
to overcome many shortcomings that conventional electrospray setups
have. The air-controlled electrospray process is similar to the conventional
electrospray process, but additional high speed air flow is incorporated.
To carry out air-controlled electrospraying, coaxial nozzle configuration
is utilized. The inner needle conveys the electrically charged solution,
whereas the outer shell supplies the high-speed air flow. The effective
combination of two driving forces, high electric field and high-speed
air flow, can provide enhanced breakup and deformation of the drops,
and thus offer (i) a much higher production rate, (ii) a better control
of dispersion of nanoinclusions in the drop, and (iii) smaller drop
size and better control of directing drops toward the collector with
more uniform and thin coatings.11,37

To prepare the
solution for electrospraying, an aqueous solution
containing PEDOT:PSS was added into the rGO solution under gentle
stirring and mild sonication to promote the dispersion of rGO in the
solvent. As clearly shown in Figure S2,
the dispersion of rGO in the solvent was significantly improved after
incorporating PEDOT:PSS, possibly due to noncovalent stabilization.38,39 To elaborate, the hydrophobic component of the polymer chains tends
to wrap around the surface of rGO via π–π interactions,
whereas the hydrophilic PSS dissociates rGO from the solvent molecules.
Such an interaction could lead to a more uniform distribution of the
rGO–PEDOT:PSS hybrid, which would promote the structural integrity
and electron transfer.

Figure 1a presents
the schematic cell configuration of the Li–S batteries with
the rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separator. The coated separator was
placed between the cathode and the anode to suppress the polysulfide
shuttle effect during electrochemical reactions. The air-controlled
electrospraying deposition process resulted in an excellent adhesion
of rGO–PEDOT:PSS onto the commercial Celgard separator
(Figure 1b,c), as demonstrated
by the folding test presented in Figure 1d. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was
employed to characterize the surface morphology of the rGO–PEDOT:PSS
hybrid coating on the separator. As shown in Figure 1e–g, a dense layer of rGO–PEDOT:PSS
covering the nanopores on the surface of the separator was observed.
This conductive layer could physically prevent the lithium polysulfide
ions from migrating to the anode compartment and improve the transport
of electrons and lithium ions, providing low polarization and fast
redox reaction kinetics.

The hybrid structure of PEDOT:PSS
and rGO was characterized using
the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, with the spectra
of rGO, PEDOT:PSS, and rGO–PEDOT:PSS presented in Figure S3. rGO exhibited very small absorption
bands widely ranging from 700 to 1200 cm–1, owing
to potential carbon–carbon bonds and oxygen-containing bonds.40 Meanwhile, the pristine PEDOT:PSS exhibited
two notable absorption bands at 1325 and 1511 cm–1 corresponding to C–C or C=C stretching from the quinoid
conformation structure and C–C or C=C stretching from
the thiophene ring, respectively. The absorption band at 1182 cm–1 is assigned to the symmetric vibration from the −SO3 group in the PSS chain. The vibration at 1147 cm–1 corresponds to C–O–C stretching from the ethylenedioxy
group. In addition, C–S vibrations from the thiophene ring
were also observed, which is verified by the absorption bands occurring
at 975 and 876 cm–1.41,42 Although
the rGO–PEDOT:PSS spectra were shifted slightly, all of the
absorption bands are from either pure rGO or pristine PEDOT:PSS, confirming
the hybrid structure from the interactions.

The redox behavior
of the sulfur cathodes with the rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated
separator was initially evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements
at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. The CV data for the
neat Celgard polypropylene (PP) separator is also given for comparison.
As shown in Figure 2a, the cell with the neat separator exhibited two broad cathodic
peaks and an anodic peak because of the sluggish kinetic process.31 In comparison, the incorporation of rGO–PEDOT:PSS
coating resulted in well-defined redox peaks with an increase in the
current density, suggesting the improved redox reaction kinetics and
utilization of the active materials in the cells.31,43 Furthermore, the redox peaks of the cathode with rGO–PEDOT:PSS
coating of each cycle highly overlapped (Figure S4), indicating lower cell polarization and excellent electrochemical
reversibility.

Figure 2 (a) CV curves at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in
the potential window of 1.6 to 2.8 V. (b) Galvanostatic charge/discharge
profiles at a current density of 0.1 C.

Figure 2b
shows
the galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of cells after an initial
activation process. As presented, both cells exhibited two typical
discharge plateaus, which is in agreement with the CV curves. The
upper discharge plateau corresponds to cyclic elemental sulfur reduction
to long-chain lithium polysulfide, and the lower discharge plateau
pertains to the formation of short-chain insoluble polysulfide (Li2S2–Li2S) products.7 The discharge plateaus for the cell with the
rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separator were found to be longer and
flatter and have lower polarization than the cell with only the neat
separator. Obviously, the cell with the coated separator delivered
a larger discharge capacity value of 1249.4 mA h g–1, whereas the cell with the neat separator exhibited a limited discharge
capacity of 834.3 mA h g–1, confirming high sulfur
utilization enabled by the coated separator.

Subsequently, the
cycling performance of the cells was investigated
further over 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C. As displayed
in Figure 3a, the cells
assembled with coated separators were able to deliver larger discharge
capacities and maintain a relatively stable cycling performance with
a higher Coulombic efficiency over their counterparts. After repeated
cycling, the retained discharge capacity value was as high as 812.8
mA h g–1. In contrast, the cell with the neat separator
showed a lower discharge capacity of 296.8 mA h g–1, which probably resulted from the limited sulfur utilization and
continuous dissolution of lithium polysulfide into the electrolyte.
The rate capability of the cells was also measured at various current
densities and is presented in Figure 3b. As expected, the cell assembled with the neat separator
suffered from poor cycling behavior. Even under a mild condition of
0.1 C, the cell continued to maintain lower discharge capacity values.
Moreover, the difference in discharge capacities between the cells
was observed to be conspicuous at high current densities in which
the effect of redox reaction kinetics was more significant. When the
current density increased to 2 C, the cell with the coated separator
still achieved 38.9% of its initial capacity, whereas the discharge
capacity retention of the cell with the neat separator was around
4.21%. After returning to the initial current density of 0.1 C, a
reasonable discharge capacity of 1069.7 mA h g–1 was able to recover, indicating an improved reversibility and stability.

cycles for Li-S cells with pristine and coated separators. (b)
Rate capability at different current densities.

The overall enhanced electrochemical performance of the cell
with
the coated separator can be attributed to several factors. First,
the increase in amount of conductive pathways that the rGO–PEDOT:PSS
hybrid structure provides facilitated redox electron transfer and
reduced interfacial resistance, allowing for a high conversion rate
of lithium polysulfide into favorable chemical compounds for charge
storage. Second, a well-developed coating layer not only serves as
a physical barrier but also gives rise to a polar interaction for
lithium polysulfides to suppress the loss of the active material,
which in turn enhances reutilization/reactivation of the trapped active
material and thus contribute to the higher capacitive behavior.

As such, a visual depiction of lithium polysulfide species and
its trapping in rGO–PEDOT:PSS is presented in the inset of Figure 4a. Note that Li2S6, which is soluble in the electrolyte, was selected
as the representative polysulfide species. Li2S6 solution was prepared to visibly clarify whether rGO–PEDOT:PSS
can physically and chemically trap a well-known hydrophobic polysulfide
species. A color change was expected of the Li2S6 solution once the rGO–PEDOT:PSS was added, and this would
strongly imply that the active material would be localized in the
cathode compartment of the cell that has a rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated
separator. As depicted in the Figure 4a inset, Li2S6 in 1,3-dioxolane
(DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent was a red-brown colored solution.
Remarkably, adding rGO–PEDOT:PSS powders into the polysulfide
solution resulted in color fading. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption characterization was also conducted to confirm the concentration
changes of Li2S6 solutions. It has been previously
reported that the noticeable absorption band in the 400–500
nm region is related to Li2S6.43,44 As shown in Figure 4a, we observed a sharp decrease in the absorption band, suggesting
that the rGO–PEDOT:PSS exhibited strong interactions with Li2S6 molecules. According to other literature, polar
atoms in PEDOT offer chemical binding with lithium polysulfides to
form a chelated coordination structure.35 In this study, the as-prepared sample is composed of PEDOT:PSS and
rGO sheets, which could provide a synergetic effect for adsorption
of lithium polysulfide. These observed results are consistent with
the behavior of the cycled separators. As depicted in Figure S5, the pristine PP separator for the
reference cell after cycling was vividly yellow because of the inevitable
contamination caused by the dissolved lithium polysulfides in the
electrolytes.45 On the other hand, the
rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separator with regions where the coating
was peeled off appeared more white, indicating that the migration
of soluble polysulfide was relatively confined on the cathode side
rather than diffusing to the anode side.

addition of rGO–PEDOT:PSS.

separator before and after cycling. (c–e) SEM micrographs of
the morphology of the lithium metal anode surface before cycling,

separator, respectively.

To better understand the adsorption of polysulfide, X-ray
photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was employed. As shown in Figure 4b, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium
salt (LiTFSI) and polysulfide peaks were observed after cycling in
the S2p spectra. The peak of LiTFSI arising from the electrolyte
salt was detected at around 170 eV of binding energy, whereas the
lower energy peak in the range between 162 and 165 eV was attributed
to the insoluble Li2S–Li2S2–S compound.46,47 These results suggest that improved
electrochemical performance could be correlated with the adsorption
of polysulfide species within the hybrid coating, which could help
suppress the shuttling effect, leading to high reutilization/reactivation
of the entrapped active materials in the cathode.

A further
manifestation of the alleviated polysulfide shuttling
effect was confirmed by analyzing the cycled lithium metal anodes.
The SEM micrographs of the morphology of the lithium metal anode
surface after cycling with the pristine PP separator and cycling with
the rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separator were compared (Figure 4c–e). As shown
in Figure 4d, a rough
lithium metal surface was observed along with irregular aggregates
in the cell with the neat separator, which is associated with the
formation of the passivation layer (Li2S2–Li2S) derived from a reaction between dissolved lithium polysulfides
and the lithium metal anode during cycling.29 This reaction is a major cause of active material loss and inner
resistance build up, resulting in the fast degradation of cycling
stability. In contrast, in the cell with the coated separator, the
surface of lithium metal was found to be smoother (Figure 4e), which is a clear indication
of the protected lithium metal surface against corrosion.29,44 This result also demonstrates that the lithium polysulfide shuttle
effect and parasitic reactions are highly restricted by the coated
separator.

Finally, we proceeded to evaluate the electrochemical
impedance
responses of cells before and after cycling. The relevant equivalent
circuit models for analyzing the impedance spectra are presented in Figure S6. As shown in Figure 5a, each Nyquist plot before cycling is composed
of a depressed semicircle in the medium- to high-frequency region
and an oblique line in the low-frequency region. The former is coupled
with the bulk resistance (R0) from the
electrolyte and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte,
whereas the latter corresponds to Warburg diffusion impedance (Ws) of lithium ions in the electrode.44 It was observed that the cell with the coated
separator exhibited lower charge-transfer resistance, which could
be ascribed to the improved electrical conductivity of the cell with
the coated separator, as the conductive layer works as a second current
collector in the cell.22,31 After cycling (Figure 5b), two depressed semicircles
and an oblique line for Warburg impedance were observed. The first
depressed semicircle is related to resistance from the formation of
the insulating surface layer (Rsurf),
and the region for the second semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer
resistance.44R0 increased for both cells, and the difference before and after cycling
was larger in the cell with the neat separator, resulting from the
increase in the viscosity of the electrolyte, which is caused by excessive
polysulfide dissolution.48 Such observation
strongly hints that polysulfide shuttling was stymied to a stronger
degree in the cell with the coated separator and caused more effective
lithium-ion diffusion. Additionally, smaller Rsurf and Rct values for the cell
with the coated separator were detected, indicating that the polysulfide
shuttling behavior and deposition of insoluble Li2S2–Li2S layer on the electrode were suppressed
during cycling. We speculate that the reduced Rsurf and Rct in the cell with the
coated separator could be attributed to more efficient chemical activation
and reutilization of the sulfur active material and improved transport
of lithium ions and electrons.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
Li–S batteries with rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated
separators were successfully fabricated by using the method of air-controlled
electrospray process. The electrically insulating nature of sulfur
was accommodated by adding the conductive rGO–PEDOT:PSS, and
the polysulfide shuttling effect was hampered by chemical and physical
interactions with rGO–PEDOT:PSS. The improved electrical conductivity
and suppressed polysulfide shuttling behavior allowed for enhanced
reaction kinetics and reutilization/reactivation of the active material.
Electrochemical evaluations revealed that the rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated
separator could deliver a high specific capacity and enhanced cycling
performance compared to Li–S batteries without the rGO–PEDOT:PSS
coating. Therefore, this study suggests high prospects of this coating
material being applied in Li–S batteries and advancing the
current energy-storage technology.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 General Procedure for Air-Controlled Electrospray
of rGO–PEDOT:PSS
rGO–PEDOT:PSS-coated separators
were fabricated by utilizing the air-controlled electrospray process.
Typically, to prepare rGO–PEDOT:PSS hybrid structures, pristine
rGO is dispersed in deionized water through mild sonication. For this
solution, a PEDOT:PSS solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 1.3 wt % dispersion
in water) was added at a rGO–PEDOT:PSS weight ratio of 1:1
and stirred vigorously to make a homogeneous solution before spraying.
The air-controlled electrospray was carried out onto a 25 μm-thick
Celgard PE separator using a Harvard Apparatus PHD 2000 Infusion syringe
pump with a coaxial needle set under room temperature. The solution
was supplied to the inner 12-gauge needle, and 20 psi air flow rate
was applied thorough the 17-gauge outer shell. The working voltage
was set at 15 kV, with 15 cm in distance from the needle tip to the
collector and 0.08 mL min–1 of solution feeding
rate. The mass loading of the hybrid coating was around 0.6 mg cm–2.

4.2 Preparation of Li2S6 Solution
Sulfur (Spectrum Chemical) and Li2S
(Sigma-Aldrich) were added to DME and DOL (1:1 in volume) to form
a molar ratio of 5:1. Afterward, the solution was heated to 90 °C
and vigorously stirred for 12 h under an argon atmosphere to yield
the Li2S6 Solution.

4.3 Characterization
Methods
FTIR spectra
were recorded with a Nicolet Magna-IR 560 spectrometer using an average
of 180 scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Thermogravimetric
analysis was carried out with a TGA 500 analyzer (TA Instruments)
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under a N2 atmosphere. SEM images were taken using a Tescan Mira3 field
emission scanning electron microscope. UV–vis absorption spectra
were obtained by using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 384), and XPS
measurements were conducted with a surface science instrument equipped
with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1468.6 eV). Electrochemical
characterizations of the coated separator were performed using 2032-type
coin cells consisting of the Li metal anode (MTI Corporation) and
a slurry coated sulfur cathode. The cathode material contained 70
wt % sulfur/carbon composite material, 15 wt % poly(vinylidene difluoride)
(Sigma-Aldrich, Mw = 534 000),
and 15 wt % Super P (TIMCAL). The default composite material consisted
of 80 wt % sublimated sulfur and 20 wt % Super P (Figure S1), and sulfur was infiltrated into the Super P at
155 °C for 12 h. The electrodes were dried at 60 °C under
vacuum for 12 h and then punched into circular disc pieces with a
diameter of 15 mm. The mass loading of the sulfur active material
on the cathode was around 1.0 mg cm–2. The electrolyte
was 1 M LiTFSI and 0.1 M lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in a 1:1
volume ratio of DME and DOL, all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox. CV and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat
(Princeton PARSAT 4000). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements
were carried out in the voltage range of 1.8–2.8 V using a
battery cycler (MTI) at room temperature. All of the current densities
and specific capacities calculated in this study were based on sulfur
mass.
