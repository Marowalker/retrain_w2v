DNA
topoisomerases are essential enzymes for all living organisms
and important targets for anticancer drugs and antibiotics. Although
DNA topoisomerases have been studied extensively, steady-state kinetics
has not been systematically investigated because of the lack of an
appropriate assay. Previously, we demonstrated that newly synthesized,
fluorescently labeled plasmids pAB1_FL905 and pAB1_FL924 can be used
to study DNA topoisomerase-catalyzed reactions by fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) or supercoiling-dependent fluorescence quenching
(SDFQ). With the FRET or SDFQ method, we performed steady-state kinetic
studies for six different DNA topoisomerases including two type IA
enzymes (Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis DNA topoisomerase I), two
type IB enzymes (human and variola DNA topoisomerase I), and two type
IIA enzymes (E. coli DNA gyrase and
human DNA topoisomerase IIα). Our results show that all DNA
topoisomerases follow the classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics
and have unique steady-state kinetic parameters, KM, Vmax, and kcat. We found that kcat for
all topoisomerases are rather low and that such low values may stem
from the tight binding of topoisomerases to DNA. Additionally, we
confirmed that novobiocin is a competitive inhibitor for adenosine
5′-triphosphate binding to E. coli DNA gyrase, demonstrating the utility of our assay for studying
topoisomerase inhibitors.

Introduction
DNA topoisomerases
are enzymes that catalyze DNA structural alterations
that include relaxation of positively and negatively supercoiled DNA
and resolution of DNA knots and catenanes.1−4 These enzymes create transient
DNA breaks to catalyze these changes in DNA topology.1−4 Because topological issues are intrinsic to double-stranded DNA,5,6 DNA topoisomerases are critical for DNA replication, transcription,
recombination, and maintenance of the chromosome structure.7−9 DNA topoisomerases are important targets for anti-bacterial agents
as well as anti-cancer drugs.10,11 Human topoisomerases
I and II are targets of clinically important anticancer drugs, such
as topotecan10,12 and doxorubicin.10 Bacterial DNA gyrase and Topo IV (another type II enzyme)
are the targets of fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, which
are critically important antibiotics.13−15 Bacterial topoisomerases
continue to be useful targets for the discovery of novel antibacterial
drugs that could avoid cross resistance with current antibiotics to
counter the serious global health problem of multidrug-resistant bacterial
pathogens.

DNA topoisomerases are classified into type I and
II families according
to whether they make a transient single-stranded nick or double-stranded
break during catalysis.1 Each family is
further divided into different subfamilies depending on catalytic
mechanisms.1,4 Type I enzymes cleave only one strand of
the DNA templates, while type II enzymes transiently cleave both strands.
During catalysis, type IA DNA topoisomerases (bacterial DNA
topoisomerases I and III) link to the 5′-phosphate. In contrast,
type IB topoisomerases (human topoisomerase I and poxvirus DNA topoisomerase
I) link to the 3′-phosphate of DNA.1,4 Although
most DNA topoisomerases can relax (−) and/or (+) DNA
supercoiling,1,4 bacterial DNA gyrase is the only
enzyme that can actively introduce (−) DNA supercoiling to
its DNA substrates.1,4

One major assay for DNA
topoisomerase activity is gel electrophoresis.16,17 Although gel electrophoresis is quick and convenient for resolving
topoisomers of closed circular plasmid DNA molecules,16,17 it is less suitable for probing kinetics because gel electrophoresis
cannot readily provide quantitative analysis of DNA supercoiling in
real time. More recently, single-molecule techniques, such as magnetic
tweezers, have been used to analyze mechanisms of DNA topoisomerases-catalyzed
supercoiling/relaxation reactions.18−21 Indeed, these elegant techniques
provided mechanistic insights into various DNA topoisomerase-catalyzed
supercoiling/relaxation reactions;22−29 however, DNA molecules must be physically linked onto solid surfaces.18,30 It is also not straightforward to derive steady-state kinetic parameters,
such as KM and kcat, from these studies. Additionally, constraint onto magnetic
beads could influence diffusion or other aspects of radial DNA access
of a topoisomerase before, during, or after the breaking/resealing
reaction.18,30

Recently, we synthesized a type of
unique fluorescently labeled
DNA molecules that can be used to study DNA topoisomerases by fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) or supercoiling-dependent fluorescence
quenching (SDFQ).31 This SDFQ method stems
from the fact that alternating adenine–thymine sequences (AT)n in the closed circular plasmids undergo
very rapid cruciform formation/deformation depending on the supercoiling
density of the plasmids.32,33 A pair of fluorophore–quencher
were inserted in the (AT)n sequence, so
that the distance between the fluorophore and quencher is dramatically
changed when the plasmids adopt supercoiled (sc) or relaxed (rx) status.31 As a result, the fluorescence intensity of the
plasmids is also greatly changed upon supercoiling transition.31 We demonstrated that these DNA molecules are
excellent tools to examine relaxation/supercoiling kinetics of DNA
topoisomerases and can be configured into rapid and efficient high-throughput
screening assays to identify topoisomerase inhibitors.31 In this work, we report an improved procedure
to rapidly and efficiently synthesize and purify fluorescently labeled
plasmid DNA molecules. Using the SDFQ assays, we find that all 6 DNA
topoisomerases examined show characteristics of classical Michaelis–Menten
kinetics. We also demonstrate that novobiocin is a competitive inhibitor
for adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) binding to Escherichia coli DNA gyrase.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Restriction enzyme Nt.BbvCI, T4 DNA polymerase,
T5 exonuclease, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England
Biolabs (Beverly, MA, USA). E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, E. coli DNA
gyrase, Mycobacterium smegmatis DNA
topoisomerase I, variola DNA topoisomerase I, human topoisomerase
I, and human topoisomerase IIα were purified as described previously.34−37 Ethidium bromide, buffer-saturated phenol, and isopropanol were
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. The synthetic oligonucleotides
FL905 and FL924 were purchased from MWG-Biotech, Inc. (Huntsville,
AL) and were described previously.31 Plasmid
pAB1 was described previously31 and purified
using commercial plasmid purification kits obtained from QIAGEN, Inc.
(Valencia, CA).

Synthesis of rx and sc pAB1_FL905 and pAB1_FL924
The
preparation of rx and sc pAB1_FL905 and pAB1_FL924 was described previously31 with some modifications. Briefly, 1 mg of pAB1
(∼570 pmol) was digested by 2500 units of Nt.BbvCI in 20 mL
of 1× CutSmart buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. After the digestion,
8000 pmol of phosphorylated FL905 or FL924 was added into the reaction
mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at 90 °C in a 4 L
water bath for 2 min and then cooled down to room temperature in the
water bath (∼4–5 h; usually this step was carried out
overnight). To generate rx pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924, 25 000
units of T4 DNA ligase were added in the presence of 10 mM of dithiothreitol
(DTT) and 2 mM of ATP (final concentrations). The reaction mixtures
were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to seal the nicks, thereby
yielding the rx pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924. T4 DNA polymerase (750 units)
and dNTPs (100 μM) were added to the ligation mixture to increase
the yield of the rx pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924. After the ligation step,
5000 units of T5 exonuclease were added into the reaction mixture
at 37 °C for 60 min to digest the nicked pAB1 and oligomer FL905
or FL924. The rx pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924 sample was extracted with
20 mL of phenol, precipitated with isopropanol, washed once with 70%
ethanol, and dialyzed against a large excess of 1× TE buffer
solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
pH 8.0). To generate sc pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924, the ligation reaction
was carried out in the presence of 25 μM of ethidium bromide
(EB). The other steps are the same as the synthesis of rx pAB1_FL905
or pAB1_FL924. The sc pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924 sample was extracted
with 20 mL of phenol, precipitated with isopropanol, washed once with
70% ethanol, and dialyzed against a large excess of 1× TE buffer
solution.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence measurements
were performed using a Horiba FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorimeter with
an excitation wavelength of 494 nm or a Biotek Synergy H1 Hybrid Plate
Reader with an excitation wavelength of 482 nm where plasmid pAB1_FL905
was used. Alternatively, fluorescence measurements were performed
using a homemade spectrofluorimeter with a 532 nm laser for the excitation
light source where pAB1_FL924 was used due to the fact that the fluorophore
TAMRA of pAB1_FL924 was stable under this condition.

DNA Supercoiling
Density Determination
sc pAB1_FL924
(4.6 μg) was relaxed by variola DNA topoisomerase I in the presence
of various concentrations of EB at 37 °C in 1× CutSmart
buffer for 1 h. Subsequently, the relaxation reaction was stopped
by addition of an equal volume of phenol. The reaction mixtures were
extracted one more time with phenol (a total of 2 times of phenol
extraction) and dialyzed against 1 L of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 twice
overnight. The topological status of each DNA sample was analyzed
by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer [40 mM
Tris-acetate (pH 7.8) and 1 mM EDTA] containing different concentrations
of chloroquine. After electrophoresis, agarose gels were stained with
EB, destained, and photographed under UV light. The DNA linking number
change (ΔLk) was determined by analyzing the distributions of
the topoisomers, and the supercoiling density (σ) was calculated
as follows 1  where Lk0 and
Lk represent the
DNA linking number for the relaxed and the supercoiled DNA, respectively.

The fluorescence intensity of these DNA samples was measured by
using a microplate reader with λex = 550 nm and λem = 580 nm. DNA concentration was determined by UV absorbance
at 260 nm using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer.

Steady-State Kinetic Measurements
All steady-state
kinetic measurements were performed in 60 μL of a buffer solution
containing either sc pAB1_FL905 (pAB1_FL924) or rx pAB1_FL905 (pAB1_FL924).
CutSmart buffer [1× is 50 mM KAc, 20 mM Tris-Ac, 10 mM Mg(AC)2, 100 μg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.9] was
used for E. coli DNA topoisomerase
I, M. smegmatis DNA topoisomerase I,
and variola DNA topoisomerase I. Human Top1 buffer (1× is 10
mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM spermidine, 5% glycerol)
was used for human DNA topoisomerase I. Human Top2 buffer (1×
is 50 mM Tri-HCl, pH 8, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 8 mM MgCl2, 35 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/mL BSA, and 2 mM ATP or indicated
in the assay) was used for human DNA topoisomerase II. DNA gyrase
buffer (1× is 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 24 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM spermidine, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 6.5% glycerol,
and 1.75 mM ATP or indicated in the assay) was used for E. coli DNA gyrase. Kinetic reaction mixtures were
assembled on ice (without enzyme) and equilibrated to 37 °C usually
for 5 min (in a cuvette inside the spectrofluorimeter). Then, one
of DNA topoisomerases was added directly to the cuvette and mixed
with other components of reaction mixtures by pipetting three times.
The fluorescence intensities of the reaction mixture at 521 nm (for
pAB1_FL905) or at 582 nm (for pAB1_FL924) were recorded every 5 s.
The initial velocity of the reactions was calculated from linear-fitting
of the first 5–10 data points. The steady-state kinetic parameters KM, Vmax, and kcat were obtained by fitting the Michaelis–Menten
equation 2   3  where V0, [S], KM, Vmax, [E], and kcat represent the initial velocity, substrate
concentration, Michaelis constant, maximum velocity, enzyme concentration,
and turn-over number, respectively.

Results and Discussion
A rapid and efficient procedure to synthesize
and purify fluorescently
labeled plasmid DNA molecules.
Recently, we reported the
synthesis of a type of unique fluorescently labeled plasmid DNA molecules
that can be used to study DNA topology and topoisomerases by FRET
or SDFQ.31 Although the synthesis yield
of the fluorescently labeled plasmid DNA molecules was high, agarose
gel electrophoresis or CsCl–EB ultracentrifugation banding
had to be used to purify the labeled products from unlabeled nicked
DNA, the oligomer, and ATP.31 Both purification
methods have unavoidable disadvantages. Specifically, gels are not
suited for purifying mg quantities of plasmid DNA, and although CsCl–EB
ultracentrifugation banding is capable of purifying the labeled products
in the milligram range, it is a lengthy, expensive, and labor-intensive
procedure. Additionally, ∼20% products may be lost during this
purification procedure and handling circular DNA in the presence of
EB causes significant nicking of the substrate DNA. Therefore, it
was desirable to develop a method to avoid these two labor-intensive
purification methods. We developed a simple and efficient procedure
to synthesize and purify fluorescently labeled rx and sc plasmid DNA
molecules (Figure 1). We used T5 exonuclease to digest nicked and gapped plasmids, and
also oligomers FL905 and FL924 because T5 exonuclease cannot digest
either rx and sc plasmid DNA molecules38 (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lane 4, and also lanes 5 and 6 with
lane 8 of Figure 2A).
We also found that T4 DNA polymerase could increase the yield of the
labeled products (compare lane 1 with lane 2 and lane 5 with lane
6 of Figure 2A). A
possible reason is that T4 DNA polymerase repaired some damaged DNA
templates during the nicking reaction. Additionally, 2 times of phenol
extraction removed most of the digested labeled oligomers FL905 and
FL924 (Figure 2A: compare
lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4; also compare lanes 5 and 6 with
lanes 7 and 8). After isopropanol precipitation and dialysis steps,
the fluorescently labeled plasmids pAB1_FL905 and pAB1_FL924 are free
of the labeled oligomers and nicked or gapped pAB1. To generate sc
pAB1_FL905 or pAB1_FL924, 25 μM of EB was added directly into
the ligation reactions. We found that EB did not significantly affect
ligation reactions (Figure S1). T5 exonuclease
was able to remove nicked and gapped pAB1, and also oligomers FL905
and FL924 (Figure 2A). With this new method, we were capable of synthesizing milligrams
of rx or sc pAB1_FL905 and pAB1_FL924 in 3–4 days with high
yields.

λex = 550 nm and λem = 580 nm. (D,E)

determine the supercoiling density of different pAB1_FL924 samples.
Lanes 1 to 9 are DNA samples relaxed by variola DNA topoisomerase
I in the presence of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.75, 5, and 7.5 μM
of EB, respectively. Lanes 10 and 11 are supercoiled and relaxed pAB1,
respectively.

In order to establish the relationship
between the fluorescence
intensity and the supercoiling density (σ) of these fluorescently
labeled plasmids, we relaxed sc pAB1_FL924 in the presence of increasing
concentrations of EB using variola DNA topoisomerase I. After removing
EB by phenol extraction and extensive dialysis, the fluorescence intensity
of these DNA samples was measured and σ was determined.39Figure 2B–E shows our results. As expected, the fluorescence
intensity was dependent on σ. When σ of pAB1_FL924 ≤
−0.04 with a ΔLk ≤ −11, the fluorescence
intensity reached the minimum. This is consistent with previous results
showing that the AT cruciform/hairpin was fully formed at σ
≤ −0.04.40 As a result, the
fluorescence was significantly quenched (Figure 2B). At σ ≥ −0.02 with
ΔLk ≥ −5, the hairpin structure disappeared and
the fluorescence intensity increased sharply (Figure 2C). The supercoiling-dependent fluorescence
transition supports that these fluorescently labeled plasmids can
be used to study kinetics of different DNA topoisomerases.

Steady-State
Kinetics of Type I DNA Topoisomerases
With rx or sc pAB1_FL905
and pAB1_FL924, we carried out steady-state
kinetic studies for 6 different DNA topoisomerases. The first
DNA topoisomerase we examined is E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, a 96 kDa monomeric type IA topoisomerase.1 We kept E. coli DNA topoisomerase I concentration at 17 nM and varied pAB1_FL905’s
concentration from 0.36 to 6.39 nM (Figure 3). This condition is consistent with previously
published conditions for testing E. coli topoisomerase I’s activity using agarose gel electrophoresis.34,41 Note that plasmid pAB1 is much larger than E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (1800 kDa vs 96 kDa) and sc pAB1_FL905 has ∼20
(−) supercoils. Considering the fact that multiple E. coli DNA topoisomerase I can bind and remove (−)
supercoils from each pAB1_FL905, our testing conditions should meet
the requirements for steady-state kinetics. Nevertheless, addition
of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I into
a solution containing sc pAB1_FL905 caused a rapid increase of fluorescence
intensity of the solution at 521 nm that reached plateau within 200–300
s (Figure 3B). Initial
velocities were calculated from these time courses and successfully
fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation to yield a KM of 1.2 ± 0.3 nM, Vmax of 50 ± 4 pM/s, and kcat of 3.0 × 10–3 s–1. These
values are lower than those that we obtained from agarose gel electrophoresis
published previously.34 Possible reasons
for this disparity include the following: (1) gel electrophoresis
is not as quantitative for analyzing the kinetics of DNA topoisomerases.
For example, the disappearance of the “most sc species”
used in the agarose-gel based assays may not represent the real initial
velocity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase
I because the 1% agarose gels in the absence of chloroquine cannot
differentiate the initial, less sc DNA products from the “most
sc species”; (2) a different plasmid DNA template, that is,
pXX6 (4483 bp) was used in our previous studies and is significantly
larger than pAB1_FL905 used here; and (3) we used more E. coli DNA topoisomerase I in the current studies
than in the previous studies34 (17 vs 8
nM). The low turnover number (kcat, 3.0
× 10–3 s–1) suggests that E. coli DNA topoisomerase I is a “slow”
enzyme. It should be noted however that the kcat values determined here represent the whole plasmid molecule
involving multiple catalytic cycles along with the dissociation rate
constant as the enzyme is released from relaxed DNA products. We also
carried out a time course of the relaxation reaction of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I using agarose gel electrophoresis
(Figure 3D). At 300
s, all pAB1_FL905 is fully relaxed, which is consistent with our fluorescence
results.

topoisomerase I. (A) Proposed reaction scheme for the relaxation
reaction catalyzed by E. coli DNA topoisomerase
I. (B) Time courses of E. coli DNA
topoisomerase I-catalyzed DNA relaxation reactions monitored by fluorescence
intensity change. For the relaxation reaction, 60 μL of 1×
CutSmart buffer (50 mM KAc, 20 mM Tris-Ac, 10 mM Mg(AC)2, 100 μg/mL BSA, pH 7.9) containing different concentrations
of sc pAB1_FL905 was prepared and equilibrated to 37 °C, and
17 nM of E. coli DNA topoisomerase
I was used to relax the sc pAB1_FL905. The fluorescence intensity
at λem = 521 nm was monitored with λex = 494 nm using a Horiba FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorimeter. (C) Initial
velocities of relaxation reaction were calculated from (B), plotted
against the substrate (pAB1_FL905) concentration, and fitted into
the classical Michaelis–Menten equation to determine KM, Vmax, and kcat. (D) Time courses of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I-catalyzed DNA relaxation reactions monitored
by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis; 465 μL of 1× CutSmart
buffer (50 mM KAc, 20 mM Tris-Ac, 10 mM Mg(AC)2, 100 μg/mL
BSA, pH 7.9) containing 2.13 nM of sc pAB1_FL905 was prepared and
equilibrated to 37 °C, and 17 nM of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was used to relax the sc pAB1_FL905. The reactions
were stopped by adding 20 mM EDTA and 0.1% SDS into the reaction mixtures.
Lanes 1–7 represent DNA samples from 0, 30, 60, 120, 300, 450,
and 600 s of the relaxation assay, respectively. rx and sc represent
relaxed and supercoiled DNA molecules, respectively.

Previous studies showed that high salt concentrations inhibited
the relaxation activities of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and also changed the final topological status
of the relaxed topoisomers.42 Here, we
performed kinetic studies of E. coli topoisomerase I using plasmid pAB1_FL924 in two different solution
conditions, 1× CutSmart buffer and 1× CutSmart buffer plus
100 mM NaCl. Figure S2 shows the results.
Indeed, high salt concentration decreased the fluorescence intensity
of the final DNA topoisomers, presumably because of the topological
status difference of the final relaxed topoisomers (Figure S2A), and also inhibited the relaxation activities
of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (Figure S2B). After fitting our kinetic data to
the Michaelis–Menten equation, we obtained the following kinetic
parameters: KM of 1.2 ± 0.2 nM, Vmax of 51 ± 4 pM/s, and kcat of 3.0 × 10–3 s–1 for 1× CutSmart buffer and KM of
1.5 ± 0.2 nM, Vmax of 40 ± 3
pM/s, and kcat of 2.3 × 10–3 s–1 for 1× CutSmart buffer plus 100 mM NaCl.
The KM value does not change significantly,
while Vmax decreases in the high salt
buffer condition, which is similar to the effect of a noncompetitive
inhibitor of the enzyme.

M. smegmatis DNA topoisomerase I,
a 110 kDa monomeric type IA topoisomerase,43 was also examined. It is the only type IA DNA topoisomerase of M. smegmatis, essential for this bacterium,44,45 and a validated target for antibiotic discovery.13,44,46 In DNA relaxation time courses, we kept M. smegmatis DNA enzyme fixed at 13.3 nM and varied
DNA concentrations from 0.37 to 4.41 nM (Figure S3). Similar to E. coli DNA
topoisomerase I, M. smegmatis DNA topoisomerase
I was able to fully relax sc pAB1_FL905 (Figure S3A,D). Initial velocities were calculated from these time
courses and successfully fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation
to yield a KM of 4.3 ± 3.0 nM, Vmax of 130 ± 5 pM/s, and kcat of 9.8 × 10–3 s–1. The KM value is slighter higher than
that of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I
and may be due to the divergent C-terminal domains.47 Again, the turnover number (kcat, 9.8 × 10–3 s–1) is rather
low indicating that M. smegmatis DNA
topoisomerase I is also a comparatively “slow” enzyme.

Additionally, two type IB DNA topoisomerases, variola and human
DNA topoisomerase I, were examined. Both enzymes can relax (+) and
(−) DNA supercoiling.1,48 Variola DNA topoisomerase
I is the smallest topoisomerase (314 aa residues, ∼36.6 kDa;
variola DNA topoisomerase I is similar to another poxvirus vaccinia
topoisomerase I except for 3 amino acids48,49). Figure 4 shows
the steady-state kinetics of variola DNA topoisomerase I. The KM, Vmax, and kcat were determined to be 2.4 ± 1.0 nM,
120 ± 23 pM/s, and 6.0 × 10–3 s–1, respectively. Human topoisomerase I is a 90.7 kDa monomer (765
aa residues)1 and an important anticancer
drug target.50 Notably, topoisomerase I
inhibitors irinotecan and topotecan, derivatives of camptothecin,
are highly effective FDA approved anticancer drugs.51 Interestingly, more recent studies showed that human topoisomerase
I relaxation activity is related to autism spectrum disorder52 and inflammation.53Figure 5 shows the
results of steady-state kinetic studies of human DNA topoisomerase
I. Apparently, it follows the classic Michaelis–Menten kinetics.
The KM, Vmax, and kcat were determined to be 2.7
± 1.00 nM, 31 ± 5 pM/s, and 1.2 × 10–3 s–1, respectively.

For the relaxation reaction, 60 μL of 1× CutSmart buffer
(50 mM KAc, 20 mM Tris-Ac, 10 mM Mg(AC)2, 100 μg/mL
BSA, pH 7.9) containing different concentrations of sc pAB1_FL905

Steady-State Kinetics of Type IIA DNA Topoisomerases
Next,
we studied the steady-state kinetics of the type IIA DNA topoisomerases, E. coli DNA gyrase, and human DNA topoisomerase IIα.
Both enzymes require ATP for catalytic activity.1E. coli DNA gyrase is a
tetrameric protein and contains two different kinds of subunits, gyrA
and gyrB that form an active A2B2 complex.1 DNA gyrase is the only known DNA topoisomerase
that actively introduces (−) supercoils in DNA substrates under
normal reaction conditions and therefore requires hydrolysis of ATP.1−3 DNA gyrase only exists in bacteria, is an essential enzyme,54−56 and could be used to identify inhibitors without significantly affecting
host human enzymes.10,57Figures 6 and S4 show our
kinetic results. Addition of DNA gyrase to solutions containing rx
pAB1_FL905 resulted in a significant decrease of the fluorescence
intensity of the solution at 521 nm that reached the plateau within
300–400 s (Figure 6B) and a complete (−) supercoiling of the rx pAB1_FL905
(Figure 6C). Because E. coli gyrase has two substrates, rx DNA pAB1_FL905
and ATP, we determined the pseudo first-order kinetics for both substrates
by fitting the initial velocity results to the Michaelis–Menten
equation (Figure 6D,E).
For rx DNA pAB1_FL905, we kept the ATP concentration at 1.75 mM and
varied DNA concentration from 0.75 to 7.2 nM to yield a KM, Vmax, and kcat of 2.7 ± 0.2 nM, 50 ± 2 pM/s, and 1.1 ×
10–3 s–1, respectively. For ATP,
we kept the concentration of rx pAB1_FL905 at 7.2 nM and varied the
ATP concentration from 0.1 mM to 2 mM to generate a KM and Vmax of 0.33 ±
0.14 mM and 50 ± 7 pM/s, respectively. The KM values of DNA gyrase are consistent with previously
published results using ATPase assays58,59 and single-molecule
techniques.60

reaction scheme for the supercoiling reaction
catalyzed by E. coli DNA gyrase. The
reaction includes two substrates: ATP and DNA (pAB1_FL905). (B) Time
courses of E. coli DNA gyrase-catalyzed
DNA supercoiling reactions monitored by fluorescence intensity change.
For the supercoiling reaction, 60 μL of 1× DNA gyrase buffer
(35 mM Tris-HCl, 24 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1.75
mM ATP, 5 mM spermidine, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 6.5% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing
different concentrations of rx pAB1_FL905 was prepared and equilibrated
to 37 °C, and 44.6 nM of E. coli DNA gyrase was used to supercoil the rx pAB1_FL905. The fluorescence
intensity at λem = 521 nm was monitored with λex = 494 nm using a Horiba FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorimeter.
(C) Time courses of E. coli DNA gyrase-catalyzed
DNA supercoiling reactions monitored by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
384 μL of 1× DNA gyrase buffer containing 7.2 nM of rx
pAB1_FL905 was prepared and equilibrated to 37 °C, and 44.6 nM
of E. coli DNA gyrase was used to supercoil
the rx pAB1_FL905. The reactions were stopped by adding 20 mM EDTA
and 0.1% SDS into the reaction mixtures. Lanes 1–7 represent
DNA samples from 0, 30, 60, 120, 300, 450, and 600 s of the supercoiling
assay, respectively. rx and sc represent relaxed and supercoiled DNA
molecules, respectively. (D) Initial velocities of supercoiling reaction
were calculated from (B), plotted against the substrate (sc pAB1_FL905)
concentration, and fitted into the classical Michaelis–Menten
equation to determine KM, Vmax, and kcat for the DNA
substrate (rx pAB1_FL905). (E) Initial velocities of supercoiling
reaction were plotted against ATP concentration and fitted into the
classical Michaelis–Menten equation to determine KM and Vmax for ATP.

Previously, it was demonstrated that novobiocin
is a competitive
inhibitor of DNA gyrase to prevent ATP binding to gyrase subunit B.61 In this study, we also performed kinetic studies
of E. coli DNA gyrase in the absence
and presence of 60 nM of novobiocin. Figure 7 shows our results. As expected, novobiocin
significantly inhibited the supercoiling reaction of E. coli DNA gyrase (Figure 7A). Fitting of these kinetics to the Michaelis–Menten
equation produced the following kinetic parameters: KM of 0.4 ± 0.1 mM and Vmax of 50 ± 3 pM/s in the absence of novobiocin and KM of 2.4 ± 0.1 mM and Vmax of 50 ± 2 pM/s in the presence of 60 nM novobiocin. Vmax is identical while KM is significantly higher in the presence of novobiocin. This
result demonstrates that novobiocin is a competitive inhibitor of
ATP for E. coli DNA gyrase. In the
Lineweaver–Burk or double-reciprocal plot, the intercept on
the y-axis of the plot of 1/V0 versus 1/[ATP] is the same in the presence or absence of
novobiocin showing that novobiocin competes with ATP for its binding
sites on E. coli DNA gyrase. The Ki value was calculated to be 11.6 nM which is
consistent with the previous determination.61

Figure 7 Novobiocin
is a competitive inhibitor of E. coli DNA gyrase to prevent ATP binding. (A) Inhibition of E. coli DNA gyrase catalyzed supercoiling reaction
as a function of ATP. DNA supercoiling reactions were performed as
described in “Materials and Methods” and also in the legend of Figure 6. The kinetic results were fitted to the
classical Michaelis–Menten equation to yield KM, Ki, and Vmax. (B) Lineweaver–Burk plot or double-reciprocal
plot of E. coli DNA gyrase in the absence
or presence of novobiocin. Closed circles and squares represent supercoiling
reactions in the absence and presence of 60 nM novobiocin, respectively.

Human DNA topoisomerase IIα is a homodimer
with 1531 residues
and 174 385 Da per monomer.1,62 It can relax
both (−) and (+) supercoiled DNA in the presence of ATP1 and plays an essential role during mitosis and
meiosis as a decatenase.63 This enzyme
is also a target of several important anticancer drugs, including
doxorubicin and etopside.10,64 Similar to DNA gyrase,
human DNA topoisomerase IIα has two substrates, sc plasmid DNA
and ATP. Therefore, we determined the pseudo first order steady-state
kinetic parameters for both substrates (Figure S5). For sc DNA pAB1_FL924, we kept the ATP concentration at
2 mM and varied DNA concentration from 1.3 to 8 nM to yield KM, Vmax, and kcat of 5.7 ± 1.5 nM, 187 ± 25 pM/s,
and 6.7 × 10–3 s–1, respectively.
For ATP, we kept the concentration of sc pAB1_FL924 at 4 nM and varied
the ATP concentration from 0.025 mM to 2 mM to generate a KM and Vmax of 0.22
± 0.06 mM and 99 ± 8 pM/s, respectively. The KM value of human DNA topoisomerase IIα is consistent
with previously published results using ATPase assays65−68 and single-molecule techniques22 for
human and other eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase IIα.

Summary
Table 1 summarizes
the steady-state kinetic parameters for 6 DNA topoisomerases that
we examined in this study. The Michaelis constants of these topoisomerases
are all in the nanomolar range. Because KM can be used to estimate the strength of the enzyme substrate (ES)
complex (Figure 8A),
low KM values indicate strong binding
of topoisomerases to DNA, which is consistent with previously published
results.34,69 Intriguingly, the kcat values of these 6 DNA topoisomerases are all low (Table 1). To explain this,
we are considering a kinetic pathway for topoisomerases (Figure 8B). The enzyme and
substrate form an ES complex and become an enzyme-product complex
through an activation ES* state. After relaxation or supercoiling
steps, the topoisomerases may need to dissociate from the DNA product
for the next round of catalysis. If topoisomerases still tightly bind
to their product, koff should be low,
which yields a low kcat. Indeed, the koff value of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was determined previously and shown to be quite
low69 (0.017–0.043 s–1). In other words, the low values of kcat of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I stem
from its tight binding to DNA. Recently, it was reported that Streptomyces coelicolor DNA topoisomerase I is a
highly processive enzymes and can relax ∼150 (−) supercoils
in a single burst in the single-molecule assay.70 Steady-state kinetic parameters were also determined using
a gel-based assay and pUC1834 to yield
a KM of 5.1 nM and a Vmax of 108 pM/s (6.5 nM/min).70 Because 5 nM of DNA topoisomerase I was used, this produces a kcat of 2.2 × 10–2 s–1, comparable to kcat values
determined in this article (Table 1). Although the SDFQ method provides quantitative measurements
for kinetic studies of DNA topoisomerases, we noticed some limitations
for this method. This assay cannot be used to measure relaxation of
(+) sc DNA. Additionally, this method only works in a relative narrow
range of σ, that is, −0.02 ≥ σ ≥
−0.04 and cannot be used to study the transition of hypernegatively
sc DNA to (−) sc DNA with σ ≤ −0.04.

DNA topoisomerases may need to dissociate from the DNA product before
the next round of catalysis. koff represents

product.

In conclusion, we developed
a rapid and efficient method to generate
rx and sc fluorescently labeled plasmid DNA molecules for DNA topoisomerases.
Utilizing the fluorescently labeled rx and sc pAB1_FL905 and pAB1_FL924,
we found that all 6 DNA topoisomerases including type IA, IB, and
IIA topoisomerases follow the classical Michaelis–Menten kinetics.
We determined the steady-state kinetic parameters, that is, KM, Vmax, and kcat, for these DNA topoisomerases. Using this
kinetic study, we also confirmed that novobiocin is a competitive
inhibitor of DNA gyrase to prevent ATP binding.
