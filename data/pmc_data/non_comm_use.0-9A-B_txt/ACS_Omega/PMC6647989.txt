Cellulose
nanofibers are often explored as biobased reinforcement
for the production of high-performance composite materials. In this
work, we fabricated transparent poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites
consisting of two-dimensional and three-dimensional bacterial cellulose
(BC) nanofiber networks. Three different composite designs consisting
of 1 vol % BC loading were fabricated and studied: (i) composites
with a three-dimensional BC nanofiber network embedded uniformly throughout
the PMMA matrix; (ii) sandwich-structured construction consisting
of three-dimensional BC–PMMA sandwiched between two neat PMMA
sheets; and (iii) dried and well-consolidated two-dimensional BC nanofiber
network embedded in a PMMA matrix. All fabricated model BC–PMMA
composites were found to be optically transparent, but PMMA composites
consisting of the two-dimensional BC nanofiber network possessed higher
light transmittance (73% @550 nm) compared to the three-dimensional
BC nanofiber network counterparts (63% @550 nm). This is due to the
higher specific surface area of the three-dimensional BC nanofiber
network, which led to more light scattering. Nevertheless, it was
found that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional BC nanofiber
networks serve as excellent stiffening agents for PMMA matrix, improving
the tensile modulus of the resulting composites by up to 30%. However,
no improvement in tensile strength was observed. The use of three-dimensional
BC nanofiber network led to matrix embrittlement, reducing the tensile
strain-at-failure, fracture resistance, and Charpy impact strength
of the resulting BC–PMMA composites. When the BC nanofiber
network was used as two-dimensional reinforcement, cracks were observed
to propagate through the debonding of BC nanofiber network, leading
to higher fracture toughness and Charpy impact strength. These novel
findings could open up further opportunities in the design of novel
optically transparent polymeric composite laminates based on the two-dimensional
BC nanofiber network for impact protection.

Introduction
Microbially-synthesized cellulose, more
commonly known as bacterial
cellulose (BC), is a lightweight (∼1.5 g cm–3) biomaterial produced by the fermentation of low molecular weight
sugars using cellulose-producing Komagataeibacter.1 It is an ultrapure form of cellulose
nanofibers with diameters between 25 and 80 nm.2,3 BC
is synthesized as a three-dimensional nanofiber network in the form
of a thick biofilm (e.g., a pellicle) floating on the surface of a
static culture medium.4 In its wet state,
a BC pellicle is tough and resistant to tear, especially in the in-plane
direction.5 In its dried and well-consolidated
state, the dense two-dimensional BC nanofiber network possesses a
tensile modulus of up to 18 GPa and tensile strength of up to 260
MPa.6 The high tensile modulus of two-dimensional
BC nanofiber network stems from the high tensile modulus of a single
BC nanofiber, which has been estimated to be 114 GPa,7 as well as the high degree of hornification (e.g., irreversible
hydrogen bond formation between the BC nanofibers).

Gindl and
Keckes8 first reported the
reinforcing ability of BC for polymers; cellulose acetate butyrate
(CAB) was used as the polymer matrix in their study. At a BC loading
of 32 vol %, the resulting BC-reinforced CAB composite possessed a
tensile modulus and strength of 5.8 GPa and 129 MPa, respectively,
a five-fold increase over neat CAB. BC has also been studied as reinforcement
for phenol–formaldehyde (PF) resin.9 At a BC loading of ∼88 wt %, the resulting BC-reinforced
PF composites possessed a tensile modulus and strength of 28 GPa and
425 MPa, respectively. Optically transparent BC-reinforced polyurethane
(PU) composites with tensile modulus of up to 6.0 GPa and tensile
strength of up to 69.5 MPa, at a BC loading of 79 wt % have also been
reported.10 Neat PU, on the other hand,
was found to possess a tensile modulus of only 0.016 GPa and a tensile
strength of only 2.3 MPa. Yano et al.11 fabricated optically transparent BC-reinforced epoxy composites.
At a BC loading of 65 wt %, the resulting composite possessed tensile
modulus and strength as high as 21 GPa and 325 MPa, respectively,
and coefficient of thermal expansion as low as 6 ppm °C–1.

Although it is evident that BC has the ability to act as
excellent
reinforcement for the production of transparent composites with high
tensile stiffness and strength, the resulting thin film (<100 μm)
BC-reinforced polymer composites reported in the literature often
utilized dense two-dimensional BC nanofiber network as reinforcement.
The BC-reinforced polymer composites produced in the aforementioned
studies started with thick pellicles consisting of three-dimensional
BC nanofiber networks that were either: (i) solvent-exchanged into
a polymer solution, followed by solvent removal and heat consolidation
or (ii) dried and consolidated, followed by resin impregnation and
curing. As a result, the three-dimensional BC nanofiber network within
the BC pellicle is compressed into a dense two-dimensional cellulose
nanofiber network.

As three-dimensional BC nanofiber networks
possess high specific
area (∼160 m2 g–1),12 it can be anticipated that utilizing a three-dimensional
BC nanofiber network as reinforcement will not only enhance the tensile
performance but also improve both the fracture resistance and impact
strength of the resulting BC-reinforced composites. The introduction
of such three-dimensional BC nanofiber network into a polymer matrix
will introduce additional energy absorbing mechanisms, including fiber-matrix
debonding (due to an increase in fiber-polymer matrix interface),
fiber reorientation and fracture, enhancing the fracture resistance
and impact strength of the resulting composites.

Nonetheless,
a previous study of ours13 showed that
a dried and well-consolidated dense two-dimensional
BC nanofiber network possessed a single edge-notched fracture toughness
(KIc) value of 6.6 MPa m1/2, comparable to that of the KIc value
of a single aramid fiber, measured to be 6.63 MPa m1/2.14 The high KIc value
of a dried and well-consolidated dense two-dimensional BC nanofiber
network stems from its high degree of hornification, which requires
a substantial amount of energy to cause nanofiber–nanofiber
debonding. The introduction of such dense BC nanofiber network as
a two-dimensional reinforcement into a brittle polymer is postulated
to produce BC-reinforced polymer composites with enhanced fracture
toughness.

With research into cellulose nanofibers for various
advanced engineering
applications expected to intensify, it is important to identify the
potential of two-dimensional and three-dimensional cellulose nanofiber
networks as reinforcement not only to enhance tensile properties but
also the fracture resistance and impact strength of polymers. Therefore,
in this work, we report the properties of optically transparent poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) composites consisting of two-dimensional and
three-dimensional BC nanofiber networks. The aim is to elucidate,
if any, the different BC nanofiber network architectures on the transparency,
tensile properties, fracture toughness, and impact strength of the
resulting BC-reinforced PMMA composites.

Results and Discussion
In this work, three different BC–PMMA composites were prepared
(see Figure 1): (i)
composite I, a 3 mm thick PMMA composite consisting of
a three-dimensional BC nanofiber network embedded in the PMMA matrix
uniformly, (ii) composite II, a 3 mm thick sandwich construction
consisting of a 1.5 mm thick three-dimensional BC–PMMA composite
(with the BC nanofiber network embedded within uniformly) laminated
between two neat PMMA sheets, and (iii) composite III, consisting of a dried and well-consolidated two-dimensional BC
nanofiber network embedded in a 3 mm thick PMMA composite. All composites
possessed a BC loading of 1 vol %.a

Figure 1 Model BC–PMMA
composites fabricated and studied in this
work.

The light transmittance spectra
of neat PMMA and the fabricated
model BC–PMMA composites are shown in Figure 2. Although neat PMMA has a transmittance
of 92% in the visible light spectrum of between 400 and 700 nm, the
introduction of BC led to a decrease in the transparency of the resulting
model BC–PMMA composites. The light transmittance of BC–PMMA
composites at a wavelength of 700 nm was found to be 74–81%.
At a wavelength of 400 nm, the light transmittances reduced to only
38–54%, depending on the reinforcing BC nanofiber network architecture.
Transparency in fiber-reinforced composite materials can be achieved
by reducing the lateral size of the reinforcing fibers and/or via
refractive index matching between the reinforcing fibers and the surrounding
polymer matrix.15,16 It should also be noted that
achieving transparency through refractive index between the reinforcing
fibers and the surrounding polymer matrix requires the indices to
be matched to the third decimal place.17 Cellulose fibers have a refractive index of 1.618 along the fiber
and 1.544 in the transverse direction,18 whereas PMMA has a refractive index of 1.488.19 Due to this mismatch in refractive indices, light scattering
at the BC nanofiber–PMMA interface occurred, leading to slight
loss in transparency of the BC–PMMA composites.

Figure 2 Optical transmittance
of neat PMMA and BC–PMMA composites
fabricated in this work.

As a result of light scattering at the BC nanofiber–PMMA
interface, the reinforcing BC nanofiber network architecture also
has an influence on the transparency of the resulting BC–PMMA
composites, even though all composites have the same BC loading. Composite I, which consisted of a three-dimensional BC nanofiber network
embedded in the PMMA matrix uniformly and composite II, with its sandwich-structured construction consisting of BC–PMMA
composites sandwiched between two neat PMMA sheets, possessed similar
level of light transmittance across the wavelength of visible light
(see Figure 2). The
light transmittance through composite III, PMMA embedded
with a sheet of dried and well-consolidated dense two-dimensional
BC nanofiber network, was found to be higher than both composites I and II. These results corroborated with the
specific surface areas of different reinforcing BC nanofiber network
architectures for the model PMMA composites (see Table 1). The surface area of the three-dimensional
BC nanofiber network architectures for composites I and II were found to be similar, measured to be 78 and 71 m2 g–1, respectively. In contrast, the surface
area of a dried and well-consolidated dense two-dimensional BC nanofiber
network was measured to be only 41 m2 g–1. Consequently, the interfacial area between the reinforcing BC nanofiber
and PMMA matrix was lower in composite III compared to
composites I and II, reducing light scattering
and improving its transparency.

In order to produce composites I and II, solvent exchange steps were used. Residual
solvents (e.g., water
or acetone) could still remain in the PMMA matrix, affecting its degree
of polymerization and hence, its thermal and mechanical properties.
This could complicate the delineation of the effects of residual solvent
or the degree of polymerization of PMMA and the reinforcing ability
of different BC nanofiber network architectures when analyzing the
measured mechanical properties of the composites fabricated in this
work. Eriksson et al.20 found that PMMA
composites manufactured using solvent-based preparation methods exhibited
lower glass transition temperature (Tg) due to residual solvent remaining within PMMA. Patra et al.21 observed that solvents did not only influence
the thermal properties but also the mechanical properties of PMMA.
The presence of solvents such as toluene or chloroform in PMMA caused
polymer chain distortion, which led to a reduction in both Tg and mechanical properties of PMMA. Therefore,
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate the
effect of solvent on the thermal properties of PMMA in this work (see Figure 3). Both neat PMMA
and model BC–PMMA composites were found to possess similar Tg of ∼116 °C in the DSC traces of
both first and second heating, consistent with the Tg of cell-casted neat PMMA.22 Our DSC data indicated that our solvent exchange steps did not affect
the degree of polymerization of the PMMA matrix in composites I and II. In addition to this, none of the DSC
trace exhibited additional exothermic peaks, which further indicated
that the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was complete
for all samples. These results showed that the measured mechanical
properties of the BC–PMMA composites could be attributed to
the differences in the reinforcing BC nanofiber network architectures
within the PMMA matrix.

traces based on first heating and (B) DSC traces based on second heating.

The tensile properties of neat
PMMA and the model BC–PMMA
composites are summarized in Table 2. Their respective stress–strain curves are
shown in Figure 4.
It can be seen from Table 2 that by introducing 1 vol % of BC into PMMA, the tensile
modulus of the resulting composites improved by ∼20–30%
compared to neat PMMA. These results suggested that both two-dimensional
and three-dimensional BC nanofiber networks serve as excellent reinforcement
to produce PMMA composites with improved tensile modulus. The improvements
in the tensile modulus of composites I and II are thought to stem from the high tensile modulus of single BC nanofiber,
estimated to be up to 114 GPa,7 whereas
the increase in tensile modulus of composite III stems
from the high tensile modulus of a dried and well-consolidated dense
two-dimensional BC nanofiber network, measured to be 19.6 GPa (see Table 2). However, no improvement
in tensile strength was observed when BC was used as reinforcement
for PMMA. All BC–PMMA composites possessed similar tensile
strength of ∼70 MPa, similar to that of neat PMMA. This could
be attributed to the low BC loading introduced into the PMMA matrix.
Furthermore, tensile strength of a material is a complex property
that depends on the process of failure.23 The introduction of BC into PMMA led to matrix embrittlement, resulting
in an earlier onset failure of the final BC–PMMA composites
and the lack of improvements in the tensile strength of the model
BC–PMMA composites. This was evident by the reduction of the
strain-at-failure of the composites (Table 2).

curves of neat PMMA,
BC–PMMA composites fabricated in this work, and dried and well-consolidated
dense BC nanofiber network.

a E, σ, and
ε correspond to tensile modulus, tensile strength, and strain-at-failure,
respectively.

The strain-at-failure
of the composites increased with progressively
denser reinforcing BC nanofiber network architectures; from 2.2% for
composite I to 2.6% for composite II, and
3.4% for composite III. Neat PMMA, on the other hand,
possessed a higher strain-to-failure of ∼4%. One of the main
advantages of using BC as three-dimensional reinforcement is its high
surface area. However, this high surface area also led to a decrease
in strain-at-failure of the resulting BC–PMMA composites. This
is hypothesized to be due to the high volumetric shrinkage of MMA
to PMMA during polymerization, measured up to 27% in our work. Such
shrinkage could occur either at the BC nanofiber–PMMA interface
or at the crosslinking points between two BC nanofibers and PMMA.
Both scenarios will lead to a notch-like effect, serving as crack
initiator and contribute to the embrittlement of the resulting composites.24 The low surface area of the dried and well-consolidated
dense two-dimensional BC nanofiber network reduced this notch-like
effect in composite III because of the reduction in the
BC nanofiber-polymer matrix interface compared to composites I and II.

The fracture resistance of neat
PMMA and model BC–PMMA composites
was investigated by performing single-edge notched bending (SENB)
loaded in the 3-point bending mode. Their representative load–displacement
curves are shown in Figure 5. The initial linear part of the load–displacement
curves corresponded to an elastic response. This was then followed
by a decrease in the load, which indicated crack propagation until
the specimen failed. Both the initial gradient of the load–displacement
curves and the specimen displacement at which crack propagated of
the neat PMMA and BC–PMMA composites corroborated with their
measured tensile modulus and strain-at-failure, respectively. The
initial critical stress intensity factor (KIc) values of neat PMMA and the model BC–PMMA composites are
summarized in Table 3. When BC nanofiber network was used as three-dimensional reinforcement
for PMMA, both composites I and II exhibited
similar KIc values of only 0.71 and 0.77
MPa m1/2, respectively, which was half of the KIc value obtained for neat PMMA (KIc = 1.44 MPa m1/2). These low KIc values can be attributed to the low strain-at-failure
of the composites. However, when BC nanofiber network was used as
two-dimensional reinforcement for PMMA (composite III), a KIc value of 1.72 MPa m1/2 was measured, a 20% increase over neat PMMA. This can be attributed
to the reduced brittleness of composite III compared
to composites I and II. In addition to this,
dried and well-consolidated dense two-dimensional BC nanofiber network
was found to possess a KIc value of 6.6
MPa m1/2,13 which also contributed
to the higher KIc value of composite III.

Charpy impact test was further conducted to determine whether both
two-dimensional and three-dimensional BC nanofiber networks will serve
as reinforcement to improve the impact resistance of neat PMMA. The
Charpy impact strength of neat PMMA and BC–PMMA composites
tested in the edgewise and flatwise directions are tabulated in Table 3. Neat PMMA was found
to possess a Charpy impact strength of 12.7 kJ m–2 in the edgewise direction and 6.3 kJ m–2 in the
flatwise direction. When BC nanofiber network was used as three-dimensional
reinforcement (composites I and II), the
measured Charpy impact strength decreased by up to 30% in the edgewise
direction and 25% in the flatwise direction. The Charpy impact strength
of composite III was found to be 13.1 kJ m–2 (edgewise) and 7.6 kJ m–2 (flatwise); which represented
an increase of 8% in the edgewise and 21% in the flatwise directions
compared to neat PMMA and ∼60% (both edgewise and flatwise)
over composite I, which utilized BC nanofiber network
as three-dimensional reinforcement. The low impact strength of composites I and II compared to composite III is thought to be due to matrix embrittlement when high surface area
three-dimensional BC nanofiber network was incorporated into the matrix
(see Table 2).

Both the fracture toughness and impact strength of the model BC–PMMA
composites were further corroborated with fractographic observations.
The fracture surfaces of SENB specimens of neat PMMA and BC–PMMA
composites are shown in Figure 6. Some degree of plastic flow can be observed in the fracture
surfaces of neat PMMA (Figure 6A), evident by the presence of textured microflow. The fracture
surface of composite I (Figure 6B) possessed a rough surface that indicated
the absence of plastic deformation; the crack propagated very quickly
due to the brittleness of the PMMA matrix embedded with BC nanofibers.
Composite II (Figure 6C) exhibited a rougher surface at the center of the
composite than at its edges where there was just neat PMMA. The crack
in composite II is thought to start at the center in
its most brittle region and propagated outwards to the PMMA-rich region.
However, when PMMA was reinforced with dried and well-consolidated
two-dimensional BC nanofiber network, a different fracture mechanism
was observed. It can be seen from Figure 6D that the dried and well-consolidated two-dimensional
BC nanofiber network delaminated and defibrillated as the crack propagated
through, whereas the PMMA-rich region fractured in a manner similar
to that of neat PMMA.

Figure 6 Fracture surfaces of SENB specimens; (A) neat PMMA, (B)
composite I, (C) composite II, and (D) composite III. The arrows indicate the direction of the crack growth.
The scale bars at low and high magnifications correspond to 1 mm and
50 μm, respectively.

Figure 7 shows
the
fracture surfaces of neat PMMA and BC–PMMA composites failed
under impact of a pendulum swing of a Charpy impact tester in the
flatwise direction. Three very different fracture morphologies can
be observed. Neat PMMA is a brittle polymer but some degree of plastic
flow, indicated by the presence of cusps (inclined platelets on the
surface)25 can still be seen (Figure 7A). However, such
morphologies associated with plastic deformation were absent from
composites I and II (Figure 7B,C). Instead, rugged surface morphology
without any well-defined cusps or textured microflow were observed.
This is indicative of matrix embrittlement. The fracture surfaces
for composites I and II exhibited the fractographic
phenomenon of “mirror/mist/hackle”, which is typical
in brittle materials.26 The “mirror”
region corresponded to a smoother area in which the crack slowly formed.
As the fracture accelerated, a region called “mist”
was produced with the presence of scarps and riverlines pointing toward
the direction of crack growth. Eventually, as the crack growth reached
its terminal velocity, distinct riverlines were formed in the “hackle”
region.

Figure 7 Fracture surfaces of (A) neat PMMA, (B) composite I,
(C) composite II, and (D) composite III,
respectively, tested in the flatwise Charpy impact test. The scale
bar corresponds to 100 μm.

These fractographic observations further corroborated with
the
higher KIc values and Charpy impact strength
of composite III compared to composites I and II. When the BC nanofiber network was used as three-dimensional
reinforcement for PMMA, matrix embrittlement could be observed, leading
to lower KIc values and Charpy impact
strength of composites I and II. When the
BC nanofiber network was used as two-dimensional reinforcement for
PMMA, crack propagated through the debonding BC nanofiber network,
which is a high energy absorbing mechanism. Furthermore, the minimization
of BC nanofiber–PMMA interface when the BC nanofiber network
was used as two-dimensional reinforcement reduced the matrix embrittlement
effect that was observed for composites I and II. Both of these effects led to higher KIc values and Charpy impact strength for composite III.

Conclusions
In this work, we report the properties of optically
transparent
PMMA composites consisting of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
BC nanofiber networks. Light transmittance measurements showed that
two-dimensional BC nanofiber network-reinforced PMMA composites possessed
higher light transmittance (74–81%) compared to their three-dimensional
counterparts (38–54%). This is due to the reduction in BC–PMMA
interface, which reduced the degree of light scattering and increased
the level of light transmittance. These results also corroborated
with the specific surface area of two-dimensional (41 m2 g–1) and three-dimensional (∼71–78
m2 g–1) BC nanofiber networks in the
PMMA matrix. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional BC nanofiber
networks were found to serve as excellent stiffening agent for PMMA.
At 1 vol % BC loading, the tensile moduli of the model BC–PMMA
composites were found to be 4.0–4.5 GPa, independent of the
reinforcing BC nanofiber network architecture. Neat PMMA was found
to possess a tensile modulus of only 3.4 GPa. In terms of fracture
toughness and Charpy impact strength, the matrix embrittlement effect
due to the introduction of three-dimensional BC nanofiber network
reinforcement for PMMA led to a decrease in KIc values by 50% and flatwise impact strength by 30% compared
to neat PMMA. When two-dimensional BC nanofiber network was used as
two-dimensional reinforcement for PMMA, crack propagated through the
debonding BC nanofiber network, a high energy absorbing mechanism,
leading to improvements in KIc values
by 20% and flatwise impact strength by 20% over neat PMMA. Our results
suggest that two-dimensional BC nanofiber network will serve as better
reinforcement for polymers to produce composites with improved fracture
resistance and impact strength. These novel findings could open up
further opportunities in the design of novel optically transparent
polymeric composite laminates based on two-dimensional BC nanofiber
networks for impact protection.

Experimental Section
Materials
Acetone (GPR RECTAPUR, purity > 99.5%) and
sodium hydroxide (pellets, AnalaR NORMAPUR, purity > 98.5%) were
purchased
from VWR International Ltd. (Lutterworth, UK). MMA (Aldrich, purity
≥ 99%, inhibited with ≤ 30 ppm monomethyl ether hydroquinone)
and 2,2′-azobis (2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) (Aldrich, purity
≥ 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as the monomer
and free-radical initiator, respectively. These chemicals were used
as received without further purification. BC in the form wet pellicle
with a water content of 98 wt % was purchased from a commercial retailer
(Vietcoco International Co. Ltd., Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam).

Purification
of BC Pellicles
The purification protocol
of BC pellicles adopted in this study was adapted from the purification
of BC from blended nata de coco cubes13,27,28 but modified to ensure that the three-dimensional
BC nanofiber network within the pellicle was not disrupted. In brief,
as-received BC pellicle (wet pellicle weight of ∼175 g, dry
BC weight of ∼3.5 g) was soaked in 4 L of deionized water and
heated to 80 °C under magnetic stirring. Once the desired temperature
was reached, 16 g of NaOH pellets were added and the BC pellicle was
left to stir in this 0.1 M NaOH solution at 80 °C for 2 h to
remove any remaining microorganisms or soluble polysaccharides. The
purified BC pellicle was then recovered and rinsed with 5 L of deionized
water before immersing in fresh deionized water under magnetic stirring
until neutral pH was attained. The purified BC pellicle was then kept
hydrated and stored in a 4 °C fridge before subsequent use.

Preparation of Neat PMMA Sheets
Neat PMMA sheets were
produced using a cell-cast process.29 AIBN
(0.05 wt %) was dissolved in 50 g of MMA and prepolymerized at 70
°C for 2 h in a water bath to first produce a viscous MMA syrup.
The MMA syrup was then poured into a cell-casting mold consisting
of two 6 mm thick glass panels (12 cm × 12 cm) sandwiched between
a 3 mm thick polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) gasket. The mold was clamped
on all sides using foldback clips to ensure that the viscous MMA syrup
did not leak out of the mold. The MMA syrup in the cell-casting mold
was then polymerized at 50 °C in an oven for 20 h, followed by
85 °C for another 2 h. A postpolymerization step at 125 °C
overnight was then employed.

Preparation of Model BC–PMMA Composites
Before
producing composites I and II, a solvent
exchange route was employed. Purified BC pellicle with dimensions
of 7 cm × 7 cm × 10 mm was first gently pressed between
filter papers (Qualitative filter paper 413, VWR, Lutterworth, UK)
to remove some of the excess water before solvent exchanging from
water through acetone (3 × 50 mL) into MMA (2 × 50 mL).
At each solvent exchange step, the wet BC pellicle was immersed in
the solvent for an hour under magnetic stirring to aid the solvent
exchange process. A final solvent exchange step was then conducted
with 50 g of MMA containing 0.05 wt % dissolved AIBN. This solvent-exchanged
BC pellicle–MMA–AIBN mixture was left to stir for 20
h before prepolymerization at 70 °C for 2 h in a water bath.

To produce composite I, the solvent-exchanged and prepolymerized
BC pellicle-MMA-AIBN mixture was placed in a cell-cast mold consisting
of a 3 mm thick PTFE gasket and polymerized using the same polymerization
condition as previously described to prepare neat PMMA sheets. Composite II was fabricated by first producing a 1.5 mm thick BC–PMMA
composite following the previously described process for composite I but with a cell-cast mold consisting of a 1.5 mm thick PTFE
gasket (instead of 3 mm). The 1.5 mm thick BC–PMMA composite
was then immersed into a cell-cast mold containing MMA syrup with
3 mm thick PTFE gasket and polymerized following the same procedure
to prepare neat PMMA sheets.

To fabricate composite III, a dried and well-consolidated
dense BC nanofiber network was first produced by pressing the purified
BC pellicle under a weight of 1 t at 120 °C for 30 min in a heated
hydraulic press (4122CE, Carver Inc., Wabach, IN, USA). This dried
and well-consolidated BC nanofiber network, with a thickness of ∼50
μm and a grammage of ∼65 g m–2, was
then immersed into a cell-cast mold (3 mm thick PTFE gasket) containing
MMA syrup and polymerized following the polymerization conditions
previously described.

Characterization of Neat PMMA and Model BC–PMMA
Composites
Light Transmittance of Neat PMMA and Model BC–PMMA Composites
The light transmittance of neat PMMA and BC pellicle–PMMA
composites were measured using a UV/vis spectrophotometer (LAMBDA
35, PerkinElmer, Beaconsfield, UK) at a wavelength range of 300–800
nm.

Specific Surface Areas of Different BC Nanofiber Networks Architecture
Nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis was conducted using a surface
area analyzer (TriStar 3000, Micrometrics Ltd., Dunstable, UK) to
determine the specific surface area of different reinforcing BC nanofiber
networks architecture. Before the measurements, purified BC pellicles
were pressed to thicknesses of 3 and 1.5 mm, respectively, to mimic
the reinforcing architecture within composites I and II. The compressed BC pellicles were flash frozen in Petri-dishes
by immersion in liquid nitrogen, followed by freeze-drying (Christ
Alpha 1–2 LDplus, Newtown, UK). The reinforcing BC nanofiber
network architecture for composite III was produced as
previously described. All samples were purged with nitrogen at 120
°C overnight to remove any adsorbed water molecules before the
measurement. The specific surface was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
equation. A sample mass of approximately 70 mg was used in this measurement.

Thermal Behavior of Neat PMMA and Model BC–PMMA Composites
DSC (Discovery DSC, TA Instruments, Hertfordshire, UK) was used
to investigate the thermal behavior of neat PMMA and model BC–PMMA
composites in nitrogen atmosphere. Approximately 5 mg was used for
each sample in this measurement. A heat–cool–heat regime
was employed, whereby the sample was first heated from 20 to 200 °C
at a rate of 10 °C min–1, followed by cooling
to 20 °C at the same rate. The sample was then reheated to 200
°C at a rate of 10 °C min–1.

Tensile Properties
Neat PMMA and Model BC–PMMA Composites
Tensile testing
of neat PMMA and the model BC–PMMA composites
was conducted in accordance to ASTM D632-14. Before the measurement,
the samples were cut into dog-bone shaped test specimens using a CO2 laser cutter (model VLS3.60, Universal Laser Systems GmbH,
Vienna, AT). The test specimens possessed an overall length of 65
mm, a thickness of 3 mm, and a gauge length of 10 mm. The narrowest
part of the test specimen had a width of 3 mm. The tensile test was
performed using an Instron universal tester (model 5969, Instron,
High Wycombe, UK) equipped with a 10 kN load cell. Before the test,
two points were marked on the surface of the test specimens in the
direction of applied load and the strain of the test specimens was
evaluated by monitoring the movement of these two marked points using
a noncontact video extensometer (iMetrum Ltd., Bristol, UK). All test
specimens were loaded with a crosshead displacement speed of 1 mm
min–1. A total of five specimens were tested for
each sample.

Microtensile Testing of Dense Two-Dimensional
BC Nanofiber Network
The tensile properties of a dried and
well-consolidated dense two-dimensional
BC nanofiber network was conducted in accordance to BS ISO 527:2012
following our previous work.13 Miniaturized
rectangular test specimens with a length of 35 mm, width of 5 mm,
and an exposed (gauge) length of 20 mm were used. Before the test,
all test specimens were secured onto paper testing cards using a two-part
cold curing epoxy resin (Araldite 2011, Huntsman Advanced Materials,
UK). Tensile tests of the specimens were performed using a microtensile
tester (model MT-200, Deben UK Ltd., Woolpit, UK) equipped with a
200 N load cell. A crosshead displacement speed of 0.5 mm min–1 was used. The strain of the test specimen was measured
by a noncontact video extensometer (iMetrum Ltd., Bristol, UK). Average
results of five test specimens were reported. All tests were performed
at room temperature and at a relative humidity of 40%.

Fracture
Toughness of Neat PMMA and Model BC–PMMA Composites
The fracture toughness of neat PMMA and BC–PMMA composites
was obtained from SENB specimens in accordance to ASTM D5045-14. The
SENB specimens possessed dimensions of 60 mm in overall length (L), 10 mm in width (w), and 3 mm in thickness
(h). Before the test, an initial crack with length a was introduced in the width direction at the centerline
of the test specimens using a CO2 laser cutter (model VLS3.60,
Universal Laser Systems GmbH, Vienna, AT). The tip of the crack was
further slid with a sharp surgical scalpel to sharpen the crack tip.
The initial crack length to width ratio (a/w) was set to be ∼0.45–0.55. SENB specimens
were then loaded in a three-point bending mode using an Instron universal
tester (model 5969, Instron, High Wycombe, UK) equipped with a 10
kN load cell at a crosshead displacement of 1 mm min–1. The beam span was set to be 40 mm between two steel rollers, 6
mm in diameter. The displacement reported in this study corresponds
to the displacement of the top roller of the loading device. A total
of five specimens were tested for each sample. The critical stress
intensity factor (KIc) of the SENB specimens
was calculated from the maximum load (FQ) when the crack initiates using the following equation 1  

Impact Strength of Neat PMMA and Model BC–PMMA Composites
Charpy impact test was used to quantify the impact strength of
the sample. The test was conducted in accordance to ISO 179-1:2010
using a Charpy impact tester (model 5102.100, Zwick Roell Ltd., Herefordshire,
UK) equipped with a 0.5 J pendulum. The impact velocity was 2.93 m
s–1 and the frictional loss was found to be 0.007
J. Unnotched rectangular test specimens with dimensions of 40 ×
10 × 3 mm3 were placed horizontally on the support
with a span length of 25 mm. The impact strength of the specimens
was quantified in both flatwise and edgewise directions. A total of
5 test specimens were tested for each sample in each direction of
impact.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The fracture surface of
the samples was investigated using a large chamber scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-3700N, Tokyo, Japan). Before SEM, the
samples were mounted onto aluminum stubs and Au coated (Agar auto
sputter coater, Stansted, UK). The coating current and time used were
40 mA and 1 min, respectively.

a As cellulose nanofibers possessed
a high tensile modulus of ∼114 GPa7 and tensile strength up to ∼6 GPa,30 it is anticipated that just 1 vol % is sufficient to improve the
various mechanical properties of the resulting BC–PMMA composites.
In addition to this, using only 1 vol % BC has the advantage of keeping
the overall cost of the final composite low.
