In order to improve
the characters of
carrageenan fibers, two different process methods were presented in
this study. Dopes prepared directly from Chondrus extraction by Route A—adding NaOH after Chondrus extraction—or Route B—using NaOH solution to extract Chondrus and carrageenan fibers (Fibers A and Fibers
B)—were obtained using the wet spinning process using barium
chloride as the coagulant at room temperature. The properties of dopes
were studied by dynamic light scattering and gel permeation chromatography.
The properties of Fibers A and Fibers B were comprehensively studied
by Fourier transform infrared, thermal analysis, scanning electron
microcopy, and tensile testing. The results showed that carrageenan
with a larger molecule weight in Dope A and Fibers A showed higher
intensity, better morphology, and stable thermal properties.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chondrus is a species of red algae which is found along the shores of the
Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea and is usually used to extract
carrageenans.1−3Chondrus has triphasic biological cycles: gametophytic
phase, tetrasporophytic phase, and carposoprohytic phase,4,5 and at each phase of their life cycle, different kinds of carrageenans
are produced.6 Our research group has reported
that the Chondrus we used was at the
gametophytic phase, and the Chondrus contained mainly iota-carrageenan.7 ι-Carrageenan
is characterized by an alternating disaccharide unit of (1–3)-linked
α-d-galactose-4-sulphate and (1–4)-linked 3,6-anhydro-β-d-galactose-2-sulphate.1,8−13

In our
previous research, we obtained carrageenan fibers directly from extraction
of Chondrus without the steps of precipitation
and drying to form the powder.7 The process
of preparing carrageenan fibers from extraction directly would play
a crucial role in energy saving and emission reduction. We found the
use of alkali solution as a solvent to dissolve carrageenan, and the
resultant solution can be spun at room temperature.14 In addition, the mechanism of the NaOH-induced complete
dissolution process of carrageenan has been studied thoroughly.15 Therefore, the addition of alkali is essential
in the preparation of dopes. However, the optimal addition time of
the alkali during the process of extraction and the effect of the
alkali on the spinning solution and the carrageenan fibers have not
been studied.

In the present research, extractions and carrageenan
fibers were prepared using two different extract processes shown as
Route A and Route B in Figure 1. In Route A, Chondrus was
extracted using distilled water, and NaOH was added to the extraction
to obtain Dope A and Fibers A. In Route B, Chondrus was extracted with NaOH solution to obtain Dope B and Fibers B.
The properties of these two kinds of dopes and fibers were characterized
by dynamic light scattering (DLS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microcopy (SEM),
thermogravimetry (TG)–derivative TG (DTG), and tensile properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Properties of Dopes
The particle dispersion index (PDI) value of Dope A was 0.224 in
DLS experiments (Figure 2A). There are two peaks with the volume of diameter distributions
(d(H)). Peak 1 occupied almost all
the volumes at 89.7%. Moreover, the PDI value of Dope B was 0.466.
Dope B showed three peaks, whose volumes were about 66.1, 31.0, and
2.8%, respectively. Peak 1 represents the diameter distribution of
a single molecular chain, and peak 2 and peak 3 represent different
degrees of aggregation between carrageenan molecular chains. The value
of peak 1 for Dope A was 89.92 nm and spinning solution B was 39.46
nm, which indicates that the carrageenan molecular chains in Dope
B had been degraded and molecular chain association was serious. At
room temperature (25 °C), NaOH solution was used as the solvent
for carrageenan, and NaOH and carrageenan molecular chains formed
a hydrogen bond protection structure, contributing to reduce the association
between carrageenan molecular chains,15,16 but in a high-temperature
environment (95 °C), this protective structure could be destroyed
to a certain extent, resulting in the association between carrageenan
molecules, and after processing for 2 h, the carrageenan molecular
chains could be degraded.

and GPC curves (B)
of Dope A and Dope B.

In addition, Mw of carrageenan in Dope A was compared with that in Dope B
(Figure 2B). The average
molecular weight of Dope A was 1.05 × 106 g/mol and
that of Dope B was 7.64 × 105 g/mol and the Mw/Mn of Dope A was
1.55 and that of Dope B was 1.56. Dope A prepared by Route A—adding
NaOH after Chondrus extraction—had
a narrower molecular weight distribution than Dope B prepared by Route
B—using NaOH solution to extract Chondrus. d(H) distribution and GPC results
show that Dope A had larger carrageenan molecular chains with good
solution properties, and the carrageenan molecular chains of Dope
B were easily degraded and associated under the action of NaOH at
a high temperature.

2.2 Structure Properties of
Carrageenan Fibers
The chemical
structures of Fibers A and Fibers B are analyzed by FTIR. It is easy
to observe that these two fibers exhibit similar IR spectra (Figure 3). For them, two
broad peaks were located at 3710–3000 cm–1 (centered at 3400 cm–1), belonging to the stretching
vibration of hydroxyl groups (υO–H),3,14 while
Fibers B displayed a peak at 3400 cm–1 that was
broader than that of Fibers A, which was because the carrageenan molecular
chains aggregated in Dope B so that hydrogen bonds of Fibers B formed
between the carrageenan molecular chains, meaning the stretching vibration
frequency of the hydroxyl group increased and the absorption band
widened. However, because of the low degree of aggregation between
carrageenan molecular chains in Dope A, the hydrogen bonds of Fibers
A between the molecular chains were smaller, and the stretching vibration
peaks of the hydroxyl groups were narrower. This result is consistent
with the DLS test result. In addition, the structure of the two carrageenan
fibers did not change greatly, including the asymmetric stretching
vibration band of CH3 (at 2960 cm–1)
and asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration bands of CH2 (at 2900 cm–1),17 a strong band of C–O–SO4 on C4 of d-galactose-4-sulfate (G4S) (at approximately 845 cm–1), C–O bonds of 3,6-anhydro-d-galactose
(DA) (at approximately 930 cm–1), and the presence
of sulfate ester in the 2-position of the anhydro-d-galactose
residues (DA2S) (around 805 cm–1).11,18

A and Fibers B.

2.3 Morphology Properties
of Carrageenan Fibers
The digital photographs in Figure 4A1,B1 show that Fibers A and Fibers B had good fiber morphology. Figure 4A3,B3 shows white precipitates on the surface of Fibers A and Fibers
B, indicating that the carrageenan fibers contained sulfate groups
and the barium ions combined with the sulfate groups in the carrageenan
molecule formed barium sulfate precipitates.19 In addition, from Figure 4A2,B2, the average diameter of Fibers
A was smaller than that of Fibers B: they were about 40 and 45 μm,
respectively. Comparing the cross-sections of the two fibers, the
internal structure of Fibers B was more loose than that of Fibers
A.20

and cross-sectional morphology of Fibers A and Fibers B [(1) digital
photos; (2,3) SEM images].

2.4 Mechanical
Properties of Carrageenan Fibers
The parameters
and the strength data are shown in Table 1. Because of the
different diameters of Fibers A and Fibers B, linear intensity was
the only reliable indicator of the intensity properties of fibers.14,21 The relationship between linear intensity, breaking force, and linear
density is as follows 1  

Table 1 Strength Data of Fibers A and Fibers B
samples	breaking force (cN)	linear
density (dtex)	linear intensity (cN/dtex)	breaking elongation
(%)	breakdown time (s)	
Fibers A	21.38	29.28	0.73	9.59	6.90	
Fibers B	25.72	46.76	0.55	10.46	6.97	
As the linear density of Fibers B was much
higher than that of Fibers A, the linear intensity of Fibers A was
higher than Fibers B: the values of Fibers A and Fibers B were 0.73
and 0.55 cN/dtex, respectively. The elongation at break and breaking
time of Fibers A and Fibers B showed similar values; therefore, the
tensile property of Fibers A was better than that of Fibers B.

2.5 Thermal Properties of Carrageenan
Fibers
The TG and DTG curves showing the thermal properties
of carrageenan fibers are illustrated in Figure 5. The first stage of the thermal decomposition
of Fibers A and Fibers B were 39–181 and 39–169 °C
respectively, related to fiber dehydration. The second stage was the
primary stage of thermal decomposition for fibers. The mass loss of
Fibers A residue decreased sharply in the temperature range of 181–184
°C (Figure 5A),
corresponding to the sharp mass loss rate peak in Figure 5D. The massive rupture of the
polysaccharide bonds started at this stage; at the same time, macromolecular
pyrolysis produced a variety of medium molecules, small molecules,
and some gases. The pyrolysis process of Fibers B (from 169 to 173
°C) was similar to that of Fibers A. However, the initial decomposition
temperature (165 °C) of Fibers B was significantly lower than
that of Fibers B (181 °C) (Figure 5B,C). As a result, the structure of Fibers A is more
stable than that of Fibers B, indicating that Fibers A have higher
tensile strength. The third stage of Fibers A and Fibers B was located
in the range of 184–1000 and 173–1000 °C, with
the quality of residues being 34.8 and 36.4%. Notably, the amount
of the residual layer formed in the final stage was similar.21 These results strongly suggest that Fibers A
has a more stable structure, which can also explain why the tensile
strength of the Fibers A was higher than Fibers B.

3 Conclusions
Two kinds of
carrageenan fibers—Fibers A and Fibers B have been prepared
with two different ways—Route A and Route B via wet spinning
processes directly from Chondrus extractions
in this paper. The DLS showed that Dope A had a larger hydrodynamic
diameter, and GPC showed that the average molecular weight of Dope
A was larger than that of Dope B, indicating that there was degradation
of carrageenan molecules in the process of extraction of Route B.
In addition, the mechanical properties, morphology, and pyrolysis
of Fibers A are better than those of the Fibers B. Therefore, Route
A is a better process for preparing carrageenan fibers directly from Chondrus extraction.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Chondrus was collected in Bohai Sea (Dalian Bay, China) during May and dried
for later use. Ethanol, barium chloride, and sodium hydroxide were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., LTD. (Shanghai, China),
and those reagents were of analytical grade, commercially available,
and used as received.

4.2 Methods
The processes
of preparing carrageenan fibers from Chondrus are shown in Figure 1.

4.3 Preparation of Dopes
The dried Chondrus was first pretreated with 8% NaOH solution,
and the pretreatment
steps have been reported in our previous essay,7 after which the extractions were prepared from Route A
and Route B. In Route A, pretreated Chondrus was added to distilled water with the weight ratio of 1/1, and the
mixture was extracted at 95 °C for 2 h. Then, the extraction
containing impurities was filtered with a 200-meshgauze of two layers,
and the extraction A was collected. Then, Dope A was prepared by adding
NaOH to extraction A and Dope A was carrageenan solutions containing
8 wt % NaOH. In Route B, Chondrus was
added to 8 wt % NaOH solution with the weight ratio of 1/1, and the
mixture was also extracted at 95 °C for 2 h. The method of collecting
the extraction B was similar as that in Route A, and Dope B is exactly
extraction B.

4.4 Preparation
of Carrageenan Fibers
The processes of wet-spun Fibers A
and Fibers B were similar, as explained in our previous report.7 Carrageenan fibers were spun at room temperature
using a wet-spinning device. First, the spinning solution was loaded
into a 1 L dope storage cylinder and extruded under a pressure of
0.2 MPa. The speed of the metering pump was 40 rpm through a spinneret
(60 holes, diameter = 0.08 mm) into the first coagulation bath containing
10% barium chloride solution and the stretch bath containing 7% barium
chloride solution. The fibers were drawn at a stretching ratio of
1.25 between two sets of rollers. Finally, the fibers were collected
in the second rollers. The as-spun fibers were immersed and washed
using alcohol (50%, v/v), and alcohol (95%, v/v) for 12 h, and finally
dried at ambient temperature.

4.5 Characterizations
of Dopes
DLS was utilized to characterize
the chain conformation of carrageenan in the dilute solution at a
constant temperature (25 °C). A laser particle size analyzer
(Mastersizer 3000) was used at scattering angles θ of 173°.
Dope A and Dope B each of 0.5 mL were added to 50 mL of distilled
water and stirred for 24 h at room temperature to form a uniform solution.
The resultant solution was filtered through 0.22 μm Millipore
filters (NYL, 13 mm syringe filter). In the DLS measurements, the
CONTIN program was used for the analysis of the dynamic light-scattering
data. The hydrodynamic diameter (d(H)) of carrageenan in dilute solution was calculated using the following
Stokes–Einstein relation as 2  where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature
in units of K, η is the solvent viscosity, and D represents the translational diffusion coefficient.

The average
molecular weights (Mw) of carrageenan
were measured by GPC on a Viscotek GPCmax (Malvern Instruments Ltd,
UK) using A 6000 M GPC column. Poly (ethylene oxide) was used as the
standard for GPC calibration. NaNO3/H2O (0.1
M) solution was used as the solvent for carrageenan and eluent for
GPC measurement.22

4.6 Characterizations
of Carrageenan Fibers
FTIR spectroscopy of Fibers A and Fibers
B were obtained via a
FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50, America). The range
of wave numbers was set from 4000 to 500 cm–1 at
the resolution of 4 cm–1.

The cross-section
and surface of Fibers A and the Fibers B were examined using a scanning
electron microscope (J Hitachi TM-3000, Japan) at 15 kV after gold
coating. The shape and appearance of fibers was also measured using
digital camera technology.

Fiber samples were kept in the state
of constant temperature and humidity (20 ± 5 °C; 65 ±
5%) for 24 h before measurement. Mechanical properties of fibers were
tested using a strength tester (LLY-06, Laizhou Electron Instrument
Co. Ltd.) at a gauge length of 10 mm and an extension speed of 10
mm/min and at constant temperature and humidity. Thirty fiber samples
were examined for tensile measurements, and the averaged results were
calculated.
