The effective interactions
of nanomaterials with biological constituents
play a significant role in enhancing their biomedicinal properties.
These interactions can be efficiently enhanced by altering the surface
properties of nanomaterials. In this study, we demonstrate the method
of altering the surface properties of ZrO2 nanoparticles
(NPs) to enhance their antimicrobial properties. To do this, the surfaces
of the ZrO2 NPs prepared using a solvothermal method is
functionalized with glutamic acid, which is an α-amino acid
containing both COO– and NH4+ ions. The binding of glutamic acid (GA) on the surface of ZrO2 was confirmed by UV–visible and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopies, whereas the phase and morphology of resulting
GA-functionalized ZrO2 (GA-ZrO2) was identified
by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. GA stabilization
has altered the surface charges of the ZrO2, which enhanced
the dispersion qualities of NPs in aqueous media. The as-prepared
GA-ZrO2 NPs were evaluated for their antibacterial properties
toward four strains of oral bacteria, namely, Rothia
mucilaginosa, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus mutans. GA-ZrO2 exhibited
increased antimicrobial activities compared with pristine ZrO2. This improved activity can be attributed to the alteration
of surface charges of ZrO2 with GA. Consequently, the dispersion
properties of GA-ZrO2 in the aqueous solution have increased
considerably, which may have enhanced the interactions between the
nanomaterial and bacteria.

1 Introduction
Recently,
the emergence of bacterial resistance to conventional
antibacterial drugs has become the greatest health challenge in the
medical field.1,2 One of the serious concerns of
such bacterial resistance is the potential recurrence of infectious
diseases that were effectively controlled for several decades.3,4 In many cases, the drug resistance has led to the prescription of
high doses of antibiotics, which often generate unbearable toxicity.5 In this scenario, the development of unconventional
strategies to treat infectious diseases has become highly desirable.6 Among several alternatives, the applications
of nanoscale materials, such as metal and metal oxide nanoparticles
(NPs), as antimicrobial agents have attracted considerable attention.7,8 Owing to their excellent physicochemical properties, including a
high surface-to-volume ratio, NPs have exhibited superb antibacterial
properties.9 Particularly, metal oxide
NPs, which are biocompatible and noncytotoxic, have great prospects
as antimicrobial agents.10,11

The antimicrobial
properties of nanomaterials are based on several
factors including size, stability, and their concentration in the
growth medium.12−14 Furthermore, morphology, surface charge, and surface
coating of NPs also play a critical role in determining the antimicrobial
properties of nanomaterials.15−18

In addition, the stability and dispersibility/solubility
of the
NPs in the nutrient medium also has significant influence on the bacterial
growth. Increased dispersibility provides sufficient time for the
proper interaction between bacteria and NPs.19,20 NPs are generally stabilized by their surface functionalization
using different types of stabilizing agents, which bind to the surface
of NPs through specific interactions.21 The surface functionalization of NPs effectively inhibits their
aggregation due to the enhanced stability and high water solubility.22−24 Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of the NPs can be considerably
improved by the appropriate selection of functionalizing agents.25 So far, the effect of functionalizing agents
on the antimicrobial activities of the NPs, such as the nature of
the stabilizing ligands, their concentration, and many other factors,
has been rarely studied. In our previous study, we have demonstrated
the effect of the concentration of stabilizing ligands on the antimicrobial
activity of silver NPs.26

In this
regard, a number of different stabilizing agents such as
alcohols, polyols, polyether, carbohydrates, water-soluble polymers,
and polysaccharides have been used to enhance the functional activity
of NPs.27 However, the toxic nature of
several chemical ligands has seriously affected their biocompatibility;
therefore, proper choice of biologically active biomolecules for stabilizing
the surface of these NPs will surely enhance their biocompatibility
and biological applicability.28 Besides,
it also helps to curtail the nonspecific toxicity of NPs.29 Therefore, rational selection of therapeutically
active biomolecules for the functionalization of NPs will surely enhance
their biological applicability.30 The conjugation
of biomolecules with NPs not only provides stabilization of the system
but also introduces biocompatible functionalities onto these NPs for
further biological interactions or coupling.31 One such biomolecule is the l-glutamic acid, which is a
natural α-amino acid and is readily available.32 Due to its biocompatible nature, it has various biomedical
and pharmacological applications. Particularly, due to its extraordinary
binding ability, glutamic acid is extensively used as a renewable
surfactant in various industrial applications.33 Furthermore, various glutamic acid-based biopolymers have
been used as ligands for the surface modifications of NPs to enhance
their biological properties.34,35 So far, the surface
modifications of various metallic NPs with an aim to provide stable
biomolecule-functionalized nanomaterials for antimicrobial applications
have been reported.36−38 However, in comparison to the reports on the antimicrobial
activities of metallic NPs, very limited information is available
on the antimicrobial properties of metal oxide NPs.39

Several metal oxides such as ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, CuO, etc. are known to possess superior
antimicrobial
properties.40−42 However, limited studies have been reported on the
bactericidal properties of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). Various
ZrO2-based materials exhibit excellent biological responses
due to their superior mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility.
Indeed, in some cases, these materials are also effective at reducing
the viability of adherent bacteria such as Streptococcus
sanguinis and Porphyromonas gingivalis and thus have been widely used in dental materials, implants, etc.43 Albeit, some of zirconium-based mixed ligand
complexes have been shown to possess considerable antimicrobial properties.44,45 However, pristine ZrO2 exhibit negligible biocidal properties,
which have been often enhanced by combining with other biologically
active materials.46,47 In this regard, surface modification
of ZrO2 has often been carried out using various physical
and chemical methods to enhance the bioactivity of the resultant material.48 Therefore, development of simple and effective
methods for the surface modification of ZrO2 to enhance
its bioactivity is highly desirable.

In this study, we have
demonstrated the synthesis of cubic ZrO2 NPs and a method
of their biofunctionalization using l-glutamic acid as ligands.
The as-obtained biofunctionalized
NPs were characterized using various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction
(XRD), ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis), and Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies and high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM). Furthermore, we have also investigated the effect
of glutamic acid on the antibacterial properties of ZrO2 NPs. For this purpose, the antibacterial properties of both pristine
ZrO2 NPs and their biofunctionalized counterparts were
tested against various bacterial strains such as, Rhodotorula
muciliginosa (R. muciliginosa), Rothia dentocariosa (R. dentoicariosa), Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis), and Streptococcus
mutans (S. mutans)
bacteria (cf. Scheme 1).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis Analysis
For this study,
ZrO2 NPs were obtained by applying solvothermal conditions
using benzyl alcohol as the solvent.49,50 In this case,
benzyl alcohol not only facilitated the formation of ZrO2 NPs but it also stabilized the surfaces of the NPs. However, when
the antimicrobial activity of the benzyl alcohol-stabilized ZrO2 NPs was tested, the NPs have demonstrated very low antimicrobial
activity. In order to increase the antimicrobial potency of pristine
ZrO2 NPs, the as-prepared ZrO2 NPs were functionalized
with a biomolecule named glutamic acid (GA). GA is an α-amino
acid, which is used in the biosynthesis of proteins in living organisms.
It possesses both cationic (−NH+) and anionic groups
(−COO–), which significantly enhances its
electrostatic and ionic/hydrogen bonding interactions with other biomaterials.51 Therefore, GA was selected as the stabilizing
ligand to enhance the dispersibility to prevent agglomeration of ZrO2 NPs in the aqueous medium and also to increase the biocompatibility
of the resulting material.52 Initially,
the functionalization of ZrO2 NPs was confirmed with UV
measurements. For this purpose, the UV spectra of glutamic acid (GA,
red line), pristine ZrO2 (blue line), and GA-ZrO2 (green line) were recorded as shown in Figure 1. Typically, GA (red line) and ZrO2 do not have any characteristic UV peaks, whereas benzyl alcohol
exhibits two prominent peaks at 215 and 262 nm.49 Therefore, the UV spectrum of benzyl alcohol-stabilized
ZrO2 in Figure 1 (blue line) also shows these peaks. However, these two peaks
disappear significantly upon functionalization with GA, which clearly
indicates the successful exchange of benzyl alcohol with GA as a stabilizing
ligand on the surface of ZrO2 (green line).

spectra of ZrO2 NPs (blue line),
GA-ZrO2 (green line), and GA (red line).

2.2 FT-IR, TGA, and XRD Analysis
The
presence of GA on the surface of ZrO2 is also confirmed
by FT-IR analysis (cf. Figure 2). The IR spectrum of ZrO2 (Figure 2, blue line) shows various intense peaks
in the range of 500–850, etc., which are attributed to the
Zr–O bond. Additionally, the spectrum also contains several
other IR peaks, which can be associated to the presence of benzyl
alcohol on the surface of ZrO2 NPs.49 For instance, the absorption bands between 1785 and 1620
cm–1 correspond to the combination bands of the
phenyl rings. The bands between 1420–1330 cm–1 and 1080–1022 cm–1 are characteristic for
the O–H and C–O stretches of benzyl alcohol. Whereas,
the IR spectrum of glutamic acid (Figure 2, red line) consists of various absorption
bands, such as at ∼3000–3250 cm–1 (N–H
stretching, characteristic of amino acids), 1550–1650 (N–H
bending vibrations and amino acid zwitterions), ∼2890 cm–1 (C–H stretching), ∼2081 (N–H
stretching), ∼1640 cm–1 (carboxylate vibration),
1710–1730 cm–1 (C=O stretching), 1250–1050
(C–N stretching), etc.53 On the
other hand, the spectrum of GA-ZrO2 (Figure 2, green line) consists of various IR peaks,
which belong to both GA and ZrO2; this clearly indicates
that GA has successfully replaced the benzyl alcohol as a stabilizing
ligand on the surface of ZrO2. Generally, the chelating
ligands (such as glutamic acid) bind the surface of metal oxide nanoparticles
through their chelation with undercoordinated metal ions present on
the surface of nanoparticles.54,55 As shown in Scheme 1, the glutamic acid
chelates the ZrO2 nanoparticles through the α-amino
carboxylic acid side. The FT-IR spectra of pure glutamic acid (Figure 2, redline) show the
spectra, which represent the zwitterionic nature of the α-amino
carboxylic acid side with −NH3+ stretching
absorption between 3230 and 3060 cm–1.56 After chelation on the surface of ZrO2 nanoparticles, this band almost disappears, and a new broad
band centered at 3450 cm–1 appears, which could
be due to side chain COOH or the remaining chelated NH groups. In
comparison with the FTIR spectrum of pure glutamic acid, there are
noticeable shifts in the region from 1700–1250 cm–1. These also suggest that the α-amino-carboxylic acid side
binds the ZrO2 nanoparticle surface. After functionalization,
the crystallinity of GA-ZrO2 remained unaffected as confirmed
by the XRD spectrum shown in Figure 3. Glutamic acid is known to crystallize in two forms,
the metastable α-form and the stable β-form. Both forms
crystallize in the orthorhombic unit cell (P212121).57 The XRD spectrum of
pure GA in Figure 3, (red line) indicates toward the stable β-form of the GA due
to presence of characteristic diffraction peaks between 10 to 25°.58 Whereas, the XRD pattern of GA-ZrO2 (Figure 3, green
line) remained unaffected and rendered the same diffraction peaks
as that of pure ZrO2 (data is provided in the Supporting
Information, Figure S5), which correspond
to the cubic phase of ZrO2. The pattern contains five characteristic
peaks at 2θ values of 30.46, 34.54, 50.45, 60.37, and 74.56°
belonging to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (400) planes of crystalline
zirconia. Notably, glutamic acid might have bound to the surfaces
of ZrO2 nanoparticles in the form of a monolayer, which
is similar to self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on 2D substrates. Although,
in bulk, glutamic acid can self-assemble in the solid state and diffract
under X-ray beam with an identical diffractogram, but on the surfaces
of nanoparticles in the form of a monolayer, it does not show any
reflection.59 The glutamic acid-stabilized
silver nanoparticles also showed no extra reflections as reported
by Chandra and Singh.60 Furthermore, the
biofunctionalization of ZrO2 NPs is also confirmed by TGA
analysis. The TGA traces of pure glutamic acid, pristine ZrO2, and GA-ZrO2 are shown in Figure 4. In pure glutamic acid, the first sudden
weight loss of ∼15% up to 200 °C is accounted for the
removal of moisture and trapped water. This is followed by another
gradual weight loss of_∼55% from 200 to 300 °C, which
was assigned to the thermal elimination of labile carbon and oxygen
moieties of glutamic acid. On the other hand, pristine ZrO2 exhibited a gradual weight loss of only ∼20% up to 800 °C
in a single step. Whereas, GA-ZrO2 has demonstrated a weight
loss of ∼30% in a similar fashion in two different steps as
observed in pure glutamic acid. This indicates the presence of organic
moieties on the surface of ZrO2 after the functionalization
with glutamic acid.

2.3 Dispersibility and Surface Charge Properties
One of the key challenges for the biological applications of metal
or metal oxide-based nanomaterials is maintaining the stability of
the nanoparticles in aqueous media. Since nanomaterials used in biological
applications including toxicology studies are usually received in
powder form, therefore, preparation of high-quality dispersion of
these materials is often required for in vitro and in vivo tests.
Furthermore, stable dispersion of nanoparticles provides a versatile
and well-defined interface, which allows sufficient contact with biomaterials.
To ascertain the stability of both pristine ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 in the aqueous media, the zeta potential of the four different
samples ZrO2 were measured, including pristine ZrO2, ZrO2 at pH 8, and GA-ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 at pH 8, as the biological properties of NPs were measured
at this pH. Moreover, pH has strong influence on the zeta potential
values, and a slight change in pH can significantly alter the quality
of dispersion. The zeta potentials of ZrO2, ZrO2 at pH 8, and GA-ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 at pH 8 were
found to be −1.78, −11.9, −1.33, and −33.9,
respectively. The zeta potential plots of all these samples are provided
in the Supporting Information Figures S1–S4. The zeta potential identifies the charges on the surface of NPs
(negative or positive) and their magnitude, which typically varied
depending upon the type of ligands used during the synthesis.61 Typically, nanoparticles consisting of near-neutral
zeta potential or mildly charged surfaces tend to aggregate faster,
which implies that the stronger the charge, the better is the colloidal
stability of the particles.62 Glutamic
acid consists of two carboxyl groups (−COOH) and one amino
group (−NH), and when it is dissolved in water, the amino group
(−NH2) may gain a proton (H+), and/or
the carboxyl groups may lose protons, depending on the pH of the medium.
Especially at higher pH, (>7) both the carboxylic acid groups lose
their proton, and the acid exists almost entirely as the glutamate
anion (−OOC–CH(NH+3)–(CH2)2–COO–) with a single negative charge overall.63 Both pure ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 NPs have displayed
near-neutral zeta potentials, which point toward their lower aqueous
stabilities. However, when the zeta potential of these samples was
measured at pH 8, the values increased significantly, which clearly
indicated toward the enhanced stability of the samples at this pH.
Notably, the GA-stabilized ZrO2 has demonstrated a much
larger potential value when compared to the pure ZrO2 at
pH 8, which can be attributed to the better stabilizing properties
of GA due to the presence of strong negative charge of glutamate ions.
This was further confirmed by investigating the dispersibility of
ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 in the aqueous solution at
both neutral and higher pH. For this purpose, freshly produced ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 were dispersed in DI water by sonicating
a 5 mg sample in 10 mL water. The samples of high pH values were also
prepared in a similar fashion in which the pH was adjusted by using
a diluted NaOH solution. Both the ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 have demonstrated lower dispersibility at neutral pH; however, at
a higher pH of 8, the samples have shown enhanced dispersibility as
shown in Figure 5;
this is consistent with results of zeta potential. Indeed, GA-ZrO2 at pH 8, which possesses highest zeta potential (−33.9),
has shown superior dispersion quality when compared to all other samples.

images of the dispersions of ZrO2 and GA-ZrO2 at neutral pH (7) and higher pH (8).

2.4 TEM Analysis
Size and dispersibility
of GA-ZrO2 NPs was further confirmed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 6. The nanoparticles are very small with an
average diameter around 2.5 nm (Figure 6D) and monocrystalline as shown by well-defined d-spacing. The nanoparticles are well-isolated
(as indicated by white circles, Figure 6C) on the TEM grid, confirming the dispersibility of
GA-ZrO2 in aqueous mediums.

of GA-ZrO2 nanoparticles. (a–c) TEM images of GA-ZrO2 at different resolutions and (d) particle size distribution
of GA-ZrO2. The TEM images of pure ZrO2 NPs
are provided in the Supporting Information Figure S6.

2.5 Antimicrobial
and Anti-Biofilm Activities
In general, the growth of all
the tested strains was inhibited
due to the presence of both functionalized (GA-ZrO2) and
non-functionalized (ZrO2) zirconia. Interestingly, GA-ZrO2 has demonstrated an enhanced antimicrobial activity toward
all the strains studied. The highest inhibition of the growth (58%
± 4.9%) was observed against R. dentoicariosa by GA-ZrO2 at 600 ug/mL (Figure 7). It was observed that the antimicrobial
activity increased by ∼11% due to the functionalization, which
is a significant change. Similarly, the growth of S.
mutans also decreased by 52% ± 2.9% and by 35.2%
± 7.9% with functionalized and non-functionalized zirconia, respectively.
Here, it is also observed that due to the functionalization, the antimicrobial
activity increased by 17%. However, R. muciliginosa was least sensitive to both functionalized and non-functionalized
zirconia. For this strain, a very small change in the activity was
observed due to the functionalization. It is however interesting to
note that the antimicrobial activity of the functionalized zirconium
increased against the oral pathogenic strains.

Figure 7 Decrease in the population
of oral pathogens (Smu, Streptococcus mutans; Smi, Streptococcus
mitis; Rde, Rothia denticoriosa; and Rmu, Rothia muciliginosa) when
grown with various concentrations of functionalized ZrO2 (orange bars) compared to non-functionalized ZrO2.

2.6 Antibiofilm Activity
When the anti-biofilm
activities in the presence of functionalized and non-functionalized
zirconia were checked, significant reduction of the biofilm was observed
in R. dentoicariosa and S. mutans, wherein a decrease of 46 and 38%, respectively,
was observed. However, the biofilm formation activity of R. muciliginosa was not affected. When the difference
between the biofilm formation activity of functional and non-functional
zirconium was compared, it was observed that the anti-biofilm activity
of the functionalized zirconium increased slightly. It is to be noted
that the maximum increase of 10% was observed against R. dentoicariosa (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Decrease in the biofilm formation by oral pathogens
(Smu, Streptococcus mutans; Smi, Streptococcus
mitis; Rde, Rothia denticoriosa; and Rmu, Rothia muciliginosa) when
grown with various concentrations (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 μg/mL)
of functionalized ZrO2 (GA-ZrO2) compared to
non-functionalized ZrO2.

Typically, nanoparticles functionalized with biomolecules can be
used in a variety of applications including imaging and toxicology
studies, etc. Particularly, the ligands with amino and carboxylic
groups are more attractive due to their excellent ability of binding
to various biomaterials such as bacterial cell walls, DNAs, antibodies,
etc.64 The ligands containing surface-terminated
charges such as COO– and NH+ effectively
interact with biomolecules through various interactions such as electrostatic
interaction, ionic/hydrogen bonding, and so on.65 Although, neutral functional groups usually prevent unwanted
nanomaterial–biological interactions, however, the charged
ligands are more effective in interacting with biomolecules.66 With regard to antimicrobial activities, in
most of the cases, negatively charged nanoparticles have demonstrated
lower uptake by bacteria.67 Since the carboxyl,
phosphate, and amino groups on the cellular membrane of the bacteria
typically renders negative charge on the surfaces. This induces repulsion
between the like charges and inhibits the cell-particle interaction,
which reduces the toxicity of the material.61 However, in many cases, there has been several evidences of enhanced
uptake of negatively charged particles despite the unfavorable interaction
between the particles and the negatively charged cell membrane.21 For instance, investigation on the uptake of
iron oxide NPs functionalized with differently charged ligands, it
was revealed that the negatively charged NPs demonstrated enhanced
uptake and toxicity.68 This increased activity
is attributed to the high level of internalization of NPs due to strong
interactions through nonspecific binding and clustering of the particles
on rarely occurred cationic sites (comparatively far less than the
negatively charged anion sites) on the plasma membrane. Therefore,
in this case, compared to pristine ZrO2, which has displayed
a near neutral charge (−1.78), GA-ZrO2 has exhibited
a strong negative charge (−11.9) on the surface of NPs. Particularly,
at higher pH, the negative charge (−33.9) has enhanced significantly
as revealed by the zeta potential study. This implies that negatively
charged GA-ZrO2 may have effectively interacted with rarely
occurred positive clusters present on the surface of the bacterial
cell wall, whereas the near neutral ZrO2 could not interact
efficiently. Therefore, the relatively higher antibacterial activity
of GA-ZrO2 can be attributed to the surface charge difference
between functionalized and non-functionalized ZrO2. Furthermore,
the exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by bacteria also influence the
interaction between bacteria and other surfaces.69 Since these exopolysaccharides are generally neutral, they
can minimize the role of surface charges during interaction. However,
being sticky in nature, they can promote binding to various surfaces.
Oral pathogens tested in this study, like S. mutans and Rothia mucilaginosa are known
to produce exopolysaccharides and are involved in dental carries through
biofilm formation and acid production.70 We have demonstrated earlier that R. mucilaginosa, which produces more EPS than R. dentocariosa, shows higher tolerance to ZnO NPs.70 From the results presented in this study, it appears that the negative
charge due to the functionalization with glutamic acid does not influence
the binding of nanoparticles with the tested oral pathogens due to
the production of EPS. Furthermore, as confirmed in the study, functionalization
has improved the dispersibility increasing the nanoparticle’s
availability and antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, glutamic acid
tested in this study is known to be involved in the acid tolerance
of oral pathogen S. mutans.71

Furthermore, the pH of nanomaterial dispersion
also has significant
effects on the surface charges and dissolution properties of nanoparticles.
Therefore, when varying the pH and improving the dispersion quality
of nanoparticles, the interactions between nanoparticles and cellular
constituents can be enhanced, which increase the chances of nanoparticles
entering the cells.62 For instance, in
our previous study, we have demonstrated that the stabilization of
nanoparticles with the phytomolecules of a plant extract enhanced
the dissolution of nanoparticles in the media.26 This has significantly enhanced the interactions between
nanoparticles and bacterial constituents, resulting in increased antibacterial
activity of plant extract-capped silver NPs. In this study, by slightly
varying the pH of the medium (up to pH 8, as the antimicrobial experiments
were also conducted at similar pH) in which the functionalized ZrO2 was suspended, the surface charges of the nanoparticles in
the dispersion varied significantly (increased up to −33.9),
which ultimately enhanced the dispersibility of the nanoparticles
in the medium. Due to this, the functionalized ZrO2 (GA-ZrO2) has demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity when compare
to its non-functionalized counterpart.

3 Materials
and Methods
3.1 Materials
Zirconium (IV) isopropoxide
isopropanol complex (99.9%), l-glutamic acid (99.0%), benzyl
alcohol (99.0%), and other solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

3.2 Synthesis of ZrO2
The
cubic ZrO2 NPs were prepared using our previously reported
method.49,50 Briefly, 1.25 g of Zirconium (IV) isopropoxide
isopropanol was added into 30 mL benzyl alcohol in a Teflon cup. The
resulting mixture was vigorously stirred to completely dissolve the
whole zirconium complex. The Teflon cup was fixed into a 50 mL autoclave
(stainless steel) and heated to 210 °C. The reaction was stopped
after 3 days (72 h), and the vessel was cooled down to obtain a turbid
suspension (white). The resulting product was separated as a white
crystalline powder by centrifugation. Subsequently, the product was
washed with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dried in an oven at 70 °C
to obtain ZrO2 NPs.

3.3 Functionalization of ZrO2
The as-prepared ZrO2 NPs were functionalized
using glutamic
acid as the ligand in the following fashion. Initially, 15 mg of ZrO2 NPs were taken in 10 mL benzyl alcohol; the mixture was sonicated
for 20–30 min until a stable dispersion was obtained. Subsequently,
the dispersion was flushed with argon gas for 30 min. Separately,
15 mg of glutamic acid was dissolved in 10 mL of benzyl alcohol, and
the resultant solution was slowly poured into the ZrO2 dispersion
under gentle stirring. The mixture was allowed to stir (slow stirring)
for 5 h at 50 °C. After this, the dispersion was centrifuged
at 9000 rpm, and the solvent was simply removed by decanting the mixture.
The sample was gently washed with ethanol (10 mL), which is removed
by decanting, and the resulting biofunctionalized NPs were stored
in a small amount of water or buffer solution (pH 7) for further use.

3.4 Characterization
UV measurements
were performed using a Perkin-Elmer lambda 35 (Waltham, MA, USA) UV-visual
spectrophotometer. The analysis was performed in quartz cuvettes using
distilled water as a reference solvent. The sample for the UV measurement
is obtained from a stock solution, which was prepared by diluting
1.0 mL functionalized NPs in 9 mL water via sonication for 15 min.
This stock solution was further diluted by taking a 2 mL solution
in 8.0 mL water. IR measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer
1000 (USA) Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. To remove residual
or unbound glutamic acid molecules, the functionalized NPs were gently
washed several times with ethanol. The sample was isolated by centrifuge
at 9000 rpm for 30 min and dried in an oven for further use. Subsequently,
the functionalized NPs were mixed with KBr powder to prepare the pellet
for IR measurements. Background correction was made using a reference
blank KBr pellet. The X-ray diffraction pattern was measured on an
Altima IV [Make: Regaku, Japan] X-ray powder diffractometer using
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Meanwhile, TEM images
were obtained from a JEOL JEM 1101 (USA) transmission electron microscope.
The samples for TEM were prepared by placing a drop of the primary
sample on a copper grid, which were dried for 6 h at 80 °C in
an oven.

3.5 Bacterial Strains
Four strains of
oral bacteria were used for the study namely, R. mucilaginosa, R. dentocariosa, S. mitis, and S. mutans. Some of these strains especially S. mutans and R. dentocariosa are known to
cause dental caries. These strains were grown on autoclaved Brain
heart infusion broth (BHI) or agar at 37 °C. Strains were stored
at −80 °C in 20% glycerol for long-time storage.

3.6 Change in Antimicrobial Activity Due to Functionalization
The antimicrobial activity of functionalized and non-functionalized
ZrO2 NPs against the oral bacteria (R. mucilaginosa, R. dentocariosa, S. mitis, and S. mutans) were determined as detailed below. Cultures of the test organism
were grown to the late logarithmic phase in BHI broth. Aliquots of
500 μL from the cultures of R. mucilaginosa,R. dentocariosa,S. mitis and S. mutans were inoculated in 5 mL autoclaved BHI
broth. Functionalized and non-functionalized ZrO2 NPs were
added to the broths to final concentrations of 0, 200, 400, and 600
μg/mL. Tubes were incubated overnight in a rotary shaker at
37 °C. Samples grown to the log phase in the presence of the
test compounds were diluted in autoclaved phosphate-buffered saline
(pH, 7.0) following incubation. Also, aliquots of 100 μL from
the appropriate dilutions were spread on agar plates, and plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 2–3 days. After incubation, colony-forming
units were determined and plotted using the Sigma plot (Systat Software
Inc., London, UK). Values presented are the mean and standard deviation
of three values.

3.7 Assessment of Biofilm Formation
Quantitative
assessment of biofilm formation and its inhibition in the presence
of functionalized and non-functionalized ZrO2 NPs was performed
on 48-well polystyrene plates (Nunc, Denmark) using the protocol of
Burton et al.72 An aliquot of 500 μL
from overnight-grown cultures of the test strain was added to sterile
BHI broth containing 100, 200, 300,400, and 500 μg/mL of functionalized
and non-functionalized ZrO2 NPs (v/v). Cultures without
NPs were taken as the control. These plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 48 h for biofilm formation. The medium containing suspended cells
was gently removed, and wells were washed three times with 500 μL
of PBS (pH 7.4). Plates were air-dried for 15 min and stained with
500 μL of 0.4% crystal violet (CV) dye for 15 min at room temperature.
Wells were washed gently three times with 500 μL of PBS buffer
to remove any unbound dye. The CV retained by the biofilm was dissolved
in 500 μL of 33% acetic acid. The absorption at 620 nm was recorded
using a microtiter plate reader (Multiskan Ascent, Labsystems, Helsinki,
Finland).

3.8 Statistical Analysis
The results
presented are the mean ± standard error of two independent experiments
done in triplicate. GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software,
Inc. USA) was used to attain statistical significance through the
Mann–Whitney unpaired t test.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we have successfully altered
the surface properties
of solvothermally prepared ZrO2 NPs using glutamic acid
(GA) as the stabilizing agent. The biofunctionalized GA-ZrO2 has demonstrated an increased dispersibility and enhanced antimicrobial
activities. GA is an α-amino acid consisting of both COO– and NH+ ions, which facilitated the binding
of the ligand with the surfaces of ZrO2 NPs. The biomolecule
interacted with the ZrO2 through its NH+ moiety,
leaving its COO– group suspended, which has rendered
a stable negative charge on the surface of NPs. Furthermore, the negative
charge increased substantially at a slightly higher pH (pH 8), which
has led to an enhanced dispersibility of GA-ZrO2 in aqueous
media. The stable negative charge and superior dispersion quality
of GA-ZrO2 has facilitated the effective interaction of
NPs with the bacterial cell wall. These interactions may have occurred
through electrostatic attraction between surface-terminated negatively
charged COO– groups of GA and rarely occurred positive
clusters on the bacterial cell wall.
