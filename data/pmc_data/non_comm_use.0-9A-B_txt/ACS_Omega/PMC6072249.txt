Atropisomeric cyclic catechol ethers
are notoriously difficult
to resolve by classical chiral phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
Here, we show the first application of sulfatase enzymes for the kinetic
resolution of O-sulfato-catechol ethers with enantioselectivities
ranging from 30 to 65% ee, as determined by preparation of their Marfey’s
ether derivatives. Substrate-structure dependence was briefly explored.

1 Introduction
Enzymes are used extensively in organic synthesis for the kinetic
resolution of racemates and desymmetrization of meso-compounds to
gain access to enantiomerically enriched starting materials. Most
commonly, esterases (lipases) are used for either the hydrolysis of
esters or acylation of alcohols, although occasionally other enzyme–substrate
pairs have been exploited (e.g., reductase-ketone or aldehyde, oxidase-alcohol,
hydrolase-nitrile, and so on) to procure enantioenriched precursors.1 Sulfatases have found use for biotransformation,2 mainly for analytical chemistry, and some examples
of enantioconvergent syntheses employing sulfatases with secondary O-alkyl sulfate esters have been reported.3 To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported examples
of kinetic resolution of atropisomeric O-sulfate
esters by sulfatases.

Recently, we were tasked with the resolution
of a series of racemic,
atropisomeric, cyclic catechol monoethers (±)-2 that
are mimics of the natural product bastadin-5, a potent agonist of
the RyR1-FKBP12 Ca2+ channel from the marine sponge Ianthella basta.4 Macrocycle
pR-(+)-2a exhibits planar chirality
and, like bastadin-5, stimulates Ca2+ release (EC50 21 μM)—the last stage of excitation-contraction in
striated muscle—through the RyR1-FKBP12 channel from stores
in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Significantly, the enantiomer (−)-pS-2a is almost 4 times more potent (EC50 = 6 μM) than (+)-pR-2a.5a

Racemic (±)-2a was resistant to separation by
chiral phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) under a
variety of conditionsa and failed to undergo
efficient resolution by acylation in the presence of commercially
available lipases.b

We found, however,
that the corresponding monosulfate esters, (±)-1, underwent enantioselective hydrolysis by sulfatases derived
from a marine mollusc. Here, we report sulfatase-mediated resolution
of atropisomeric O-sulfato-catechol monomethyl ethers
(±)-1a,b by the aryl sulfatase from
abalone, Haliotis sp., in modest to good enantiomeric
excess. The latter result was somewhat surprising as the well-studied
aryl sulfatases from other mollusc, Helix pomatia and Patella vulgata, were unreactive
under the same conditions.c

2 Results and Discussion
A survey of kinetic resolution was
carried out with commercially
available sulfatases on two substrates: the nitro- and azido-substituted
macrocyclic catechol monoethers (±)-1a,b (Scheme 1). Both
of the latter compounds are masked aniline derivatives that would
be suitable precursors for reductive conversion to diazonium salts,
ArN2+, and substitution of N2 with
a variety of groups (e.g., Sandmeyer reaction: Cl, Br, or CN) to explore
modulation of RyR1-FKBP12.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Atropisomeric Cyclic Catechol
Monoether Sulfate Esters
Macrocyclic catechol ethers (±)-2a–c were prepared (Scheme 1), starting with atropisomeric (±)-3, obtained from intramolecular SNAr cyclization (K2CO3, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) of the 4-fluoro-3-nitroaryl
precursor, as previously described.5d Initial attempts at sulfation of (±)-2a using conventional reagents (e.g., 1 equiv Me3N·SO3, pyridine·SO3, and sulfamic
acid, Δ) failed to provide any detectable product (±)-1a. Because, in our hands, sulfation of 4-nitrophenol was
successful under all of the above conditions, we surmised that the
failure of (±)-2a to react was due to the highly
hindered nature of the phenolic OH. Finally, when (±)-2a or (±)-2b was treated under forcing conditions
(100 equiv Me3N·SO3, dimethylformamide,
50 °C, 5 days), acceptable yields (∼10%) of (±)-1a,b were obtained for enzyme studies.e The Me3NH+ counterion in each
product was exchanged with Na+ (Dowex AG 50 W-X8, Na+ form) prior to enzymatic reactions.

The susceptibility
of the sulfate esters toward enzyme-promoted
hydrolysis was examined at two different temperatures (acetate buffer,
pH 6.8) with commercially available sulfatases obtained from three
molluscan sources: A, from abalone, Haliotis sp.;
B, from the intertidal limpet, P. vulgata; and C, from the Burgundy snail, H. pomatia.

In the course of this investigation, an analytical method
was required
to quantitate the otherwise inseparable enantiomers of (±)-2a–c. The latter need was met with the
development of an HPLC method (Scheme 2), on the basis of conversion of the product catechols, 2a–c, to the corresponding diastereomeric
diaryl ethers 4a–c and 5a–c with l-Marfey’s reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alaninamide,6 K2CO3, DMSO, 1 h, 23 °C) and peak integration.

Derivatives of (±)-2a–c. HPLC
Analysis
Nitro-substituted
macrocycle (±)-1a underwent
reaction (Table 1)
with sulfatase A (22 °C) to give (±)-2a with
modest enantioselectivity (55% ee, krel = 5.2), which diminished at a higher temperature (37 °C, 45%
ee, krel = 3.7). The azido-substituted
macrocycle (±)-1b was partially resolved in good
enantioselectivity at 22 °C by enzyme A (entry 8, 65% ee, krel = 7.9) but poorly so at 37 °C (30%
ee, krel = 2.3). Attempted resolutions
of (±)-1b with enzymes B and C, at either temperature,
were unsuccessful and gave no product.

a Reactions were run with substrate
(10 mM) and sulfatase (15 U) dissolved in aqueous buffer (pH = 6.8,
0.25 M, NaOAc–HOAc) within a conical vial sealed with a Teflon-lined
cap.

b krel was determined at 45% conversion (c =
0.45) measured
by UV-HPLC peak integration (C18, isocratic MeOH–H2O–HCOOH) (60:40:0.25).

c Enzymes were used as received (Sigma-Aldrich)
derived from the following sources: A, abalone (Haliotis sp.); B, European limpet (P. vulgata); C, Burgundy snail (H. pomatia).

C18 (MeOH–H2O, 60:40) or SiO2 (CH2Cl2-MeOH, 97:3) of Marfey’s derivative
of 2 (see Scheme 2, l-Marfey’s reagent, K2CO3, DMSO, room temperature, 1 h). See Scheme 3 for determination of absolute configuration
of 2.

e No product
detected.

f Calculated using
the equation krel = ln(1 – c(1 + ee))/ln(1
– c(1 + ee)), where ee is the enantiomeric
excess of the product and c is the conversion.

Assignment of absolute stereostructure
of the product (−)-2a (Scheme 3) was achieved through chemical correlation.
An independent synthesis of the “syn”
atropisomer (±)-6a (X-ray crystal structure5) followed by enzymatic kinetic resolution (Novozyme
435, vinyl acetate, wet CH3CN, 70 °C, 5 days) gave
benzylic O-acetate (−)-pS-7a, which was easily separated from (+)-pS-2a by flash chromatography (silica). Acetate ester 7a was ammoniolysed (NH3, MeOH) to benzylic alcohol
(−)-6a, which was converted (deoxygenation and
deprotection, as described elsewhere5)
to (−)-pS-2a (>99% ee), which
was identical, except for optical purity, to that obtained from sulfatase-promoted
hydrolysis of (±)-1a.f Therefore,
the enantioselection of Haliotis-derived sulfatase
A toward (±)-1a is for the (−)-pS-enantiomer.g

Scheme 3 Assignment of Absolute
Configuration of Resolved (−)-pS-2a
A comparison of the three sulfatases,
A, B, and C, showed that
only A exhibited hydrolytic activity for kinetic resolutions of (±)-1a,b. No simple trend was observed in enantioselectivity
of the nitro- versus azido-substituted substrates, (±)-1a,b, and we conclude that the π-acidity
of the aryl ether ring is less important than steric properties of
the substituents that impose rigidity on the macrocycle. Unlike sulfatase-promoted
hydrolysis of secondary linear alkyl O-sulfate esters,
the current enzyme active site models are inadequate at explaining
either the enantiopreference or factors that determine enantioselectivity
in atropisomeric kinetic resolution of (±)-1a,b.

Wallner and co-workers showed that O-n-alkyl sulfate esters of long-chain secondary
alcohols undergo hydrolysis
in the presence of sulfatase from the archean, Sulfolobus
acidocaldarious (Crenarchaea) DSM 639 (pH 2–3),
with excellent enantioselectivity (>99% ee).7 Interestingly, for racemic secondary alkyl O-sulfates,
hydrolysis is enantiospecific and selects for the R enantiomer by SN2 reaction with H2O at C,
with inversion, to give the corresponding (S) secondary alcohol. Consequently,
this so-called “inverting” enzyme carries out highly
enantioselective kinetic resolutions (E > 200)
of
a limited range of secondary racemic O-sulfates to
deliver enantioenriched products (>97% ee R).7h In contrast, sulfatase-mediated
hydrolysis of aryl O-sulfates, of necessity, is hydrolyzed
by attack of H2O at S.

In the present case of kinetic
resolution of (±)-1 → 2, the
latter mechanism must proceed through
a transition state within the enzyme active site that differs considerably
from that of O-alkyl sulfatases. Molluscan sulfatases
(e.g., H. pomatia) are known to be
of the aryl sulfatase class and operate through a mechanism that involves
transesterification of the aryl sulfate, stabilized within the active
site by metal coordination and ligation to Lys and His residues, followed
by initial attack on S by one hydroxyl of an aldehyde hydrate i, derived from Ca-formyl glycine (FG, Figure 1), followed by the successive displacement
of ArOH and elimination of bisulfate.

for aryl sulfatase enzymes.
For clarity, metal ions are not shown. Adapted from ref (2b).

We anticipated that resolution of (±)-1a would
strongly depend on the rigidified chiral space defined by the macrocycle
conformation and enzyme active site. We briefly examined the density
functional theory (DFT) optimized geometry of pS-1a (B3LYP/6-31+G(d), H2O continuum, Figure 2) to ascertain intramolecular
nonbonded and dipolar interactions that may shed light on the origins
of enantioselectivity.

Figure 2 Model of DFT optimized geometry of (−)-pS-1a (geometries at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level and
energies
at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) level, H2O continuum), (a) and
(b) rotated 90°.

As expected, the two phenyl rings are skewed from each other
and
subtend a C–O–C–C(NO2) torsional angle
of θ = −104.4° to relieve ring strain. No dominant
bonding interaction appears between the NO2 group and the OSO3– groups, although this will depend on the degree
of association with the Na+ counterion and solvation. Assuming
a similar conformation in the sulfatase binding pocket, the geometry
of 1a appears to favor the approach of a nucleophilic
hydrate–enzyme complex (Figure 1) from the catechol face opposite the nitroaryl group,
which blocks access to the sulfate group. The product, (−)-pS-2a, is favored likely by contacts within
the enzyme active site that largely accommodate (−)-pS-1a geometry through nonbonded accommodation
of the distal linker atoms and nitroaryl group, rather than a conventional
three-point binding model, which stabilizes a particular sulfate-transition
state geometry.

Despite the widespread use of molluscan sulfatases
in analytical
chemistry8 and ease of procurement from H. pomatia or Haliotis spp., little
is known of their enzymology pertaining to kinetic resolution.3

Specific sulfatases have been isolated
from whole tissues of H. pomatia,9 and the kinetics
of hydrolysis of a- and b-naphthol sulfate esters, with an immobilized
form of the enzyme, have been studied.10 Recently, two sulfastase cDNAs—designated SULF1 and SULF2—have
been cloned and characterized from H. pomatia,11 opening a window of opportunity for
refinement, and directed evolution and improvement of specific activity
and enantioselectivity similar to the advantages accorded to sulfatases
derived from prokaryotes and archaea (e.g., Sulfolobus). In contrast, similar studies of sulfatases derived from Haliotis have not appeared in the literature.

The
preliminary studies described here, together with recent interest
in sulfatases,2 should provide a foundation
for the expanded exploration of sulfatase activity in organic synthesis.
Although individual sulfatases have been purified and characterized
from the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens,12 and other species, no X-ray crystal
structures are available yet.13 Further
studies on organotransformations using sulfatase Haliotis spp. may benefit from cloning and “directed evolution”
approaches that have seen great success in refining other classes
of enzymes as biocatalysts in organic synthesis (e.g., bacterial lipases,14 hydrolases,15 oxidases16).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the use of Haliotis-derived sulfatase
for kinetic resolution of atropisomeric cyclic monosulfate esters
in modest to good enantioselectivity is described for the first time.
The study also resulted in a useful analytical HPLC method for determining
% ee in kinetically resolved products—the otherwise inseparable,
cyclic atropisomeric catechol monoethers.

to give (−)-pS-2a in 50% ee and

of Novozyme 435 for hydrolysis of acetates of benzylic alcohols; however,
in the present case, it was also corroborated by independent synthesis
of pS-7a, starting with the asymmetric
Henry reaction of aldehyde ii with CH3NO2, using Trost’s (R,R)-catalyst iii to give iv (54%, 77% ee). Trost, B. M.; Yeh,

g Although not rigorously
proven here,
we assume the sulfatase preference toward (±)-2b is also for the pS configuration.

h It should be noted that the successful
kinetic resolutions of Wallner’s sulfatase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639 are as much the
outcome of extensive screening-selection of sulfur-metabolizing archaea
as it is refinement of reaction conditions.
