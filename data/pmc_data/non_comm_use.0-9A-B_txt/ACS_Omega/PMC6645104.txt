In the present investigation, we have proposed a novel form of two-dimensional (2D)
carbon allotropes with the aid of first-principle density functional
theory-based calculations. The carbon polymorph is mainly composed
of carbon pentagons (cp) and acetylenic linkers and hence named cp-graphyne.
This 2D material is energetically more preferable than the rest of
the semimetals of graphyne family, including graphdiyne monolayer.
Close inspection of lattice dynamics and thermal and mechanical properties
demonstrates the excellent dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stabilities
of cp-graphyne. Interestingly, cp-graphyne exhibits a semimetallic
nature and possesses double distorted Dirac points in the electronic
band spectrum. The Fermi velocities (vf) of cp-graphyne are highly anisotropic and are predicted to be in
the range of 1.50–8.20 × 105 m/s. Furthermore,
the analysis of structural and electronic properties of the cp-graphyne
bilayer discloses the presence of self-doped Dirac-like points nearer
to the Fermi level in the electronic spectrum.

1 Introduction
The
success of graphene1−3 in various fields, including chemistry
and materials science and technology, provokes the researchers to
develop multifunctional two-dimensional (2D) materials.4−10 For example, a broad range of 2D materials have been reported in
the literature, including the elemental allotropes of C,11−14 Si,15 Ge,16,17 Sn,18,19 B,20,21 Al,22 and P23 and their 2D alloys with different stoichiometric
ratios using both theoretical and experimental strategies. However,
graphene is exceptional among all of these materials due to its promising24,25 prospects and extensive applications3 in various areas. In particular, graphene exhibits peculiar electronic26 properties when compared with those of other
2D materials. The unique electronic properties of graphene, including
massless Dirac fermions,27 half-integer
quantum Hall effect,28 Klein paradox,29 ultrahigh carrier mobility, and other topological
properties,30,31 are mainly attributed to linear
band dispersion in proximity of the Fermi level around the high-symmetry
special points, K (K′). The
linear dispersion in the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB)
leads to the formation of double Dirac cones. The vertices of the
two Dirac cones meet each other at only one contact point, K (K′), on the Fermi level in the
hexagonal Brillouin zone. This contact point is called the Dirac point
of graphene. Similar electronic systems are well-defined by the relativistic
Dirac equation rather than by the usual Schrödinger equation. The 2D or three-dimensional
(3D) materials coupled with these properties are grouped into a special
case of materials, the Dirac materials.32,33

Numerous
2D materials have been reported in the literature33 within the context of Dirac materials with linear
band dispersion and associated Dirac points. For example, the other
members of group IV elements such as silicon and germanium also form
stable 2D materials, namely, silicene and germanene, respectively.
Recently, single and multilayers of silicene and germanene have been
synthesized on metallic substrates. Excitingly, the 2D monolayers
of silicene15,34 and germanene16 show linear band crossing at the Fermi level similar to that in graphene.
Furthermore, the electronic structure of a 2D alloy of silicon and
germanium, that is, silicon germanide35 monolayer, was also characterized by the Dirac cones in the proximity
of the Fermi level. The boron counterparts, such as Pmmn-boron36 and striped boron sheet (hr-sB),37 depict the Dirac states in their electronic
band spectrum. Furthermore, the two-dimensional transition metal diborides,
which include m-TiB238 and FeB2,39 have
linear band dispersion in their electronic band structure. Distinct
from those in graphene, the Dirac states in these 2D materials are
primarily originated from the d-orbitals of transition metal atoms.
Similar to the m-TiB2 and FeB2, so-MoS240 also uses its d-orbitals
for the formation of linear band dispersion in the proximity of the
Fermi level. Interestingly, the massless Dirac fermions in so-MoS2 coexist with the massive fermions. The monolayer of black
phosphorus is a semiconductor23 with a
direct band gap of 1.00 eV at the center of the Brillouin zone. However,
it is plausible to achieve Dirac states in the multilayered black
phosphorus41 by the application of an optimal
external electric field.42 The planar Be3C243 and quasi-planar
Be5C244 monolayers
have recently been predicted to exhibit semimetallic nature with Dirac-like
points. A broad range of 2D networks of conjugated polymers45 also demonstrates conical valence and conduction
bands in their electronic fingerprints analogous to those of graphene.
The heteroatomic networks (janugraphene and chlorographene)11 coupled with the rectangular lattices and nonequivalent
bonds also possess Dirac points. Graphene with nitrogen line defects,46 Ni2C18H12,
and Co2C18H1247 are some of the 2D materials with linear band dispersion
relation in their electronic band structures. This indicates that
there is an immense interest in exploring novel materials with Dirac
points.

In addition to these heteroatomic 2D architectures,
there is another
class of Dirac materials, which includes only pure carbon allotropes.
The pure carbon-based Dirac materials are mainly composed of sp- and
sp2-hybridized C atoms. For instance, phagraphene12 is a 2D carbon network, which is mainly composed
of sp2-hybridized 5-6-7 carbon polygons. Furthermore, phagraphene
is familiar for its outstanding thermodynamic feasibility and distorted
Dirac cones. Similarly, S-graphene,48 D-graphene,48 E-graphene,48 and
ph-graphene49 mostly comprise sp2-hybridized C atoms in their 2D architectures. These materials also
have linear band dispersion and consequent Dirac points at the Fermi
level. On the other hand, most of the graphyne50 networks, such as α-, β-,51 δ-,13 R-,52 6,6,12-,51 14,14,14-, 14,14,18-,53 14,12,2-, and 14,12,4-graphynes14 and α-graphdiyne,54 are
included in the family of Dirac materials. Distinct from graphene,
graphynes are materialized using both sp- and sp2-hybridized
carbon states.50 The ratio of sp-hybridized
C atoms in the monolayer gives an intimation regarding the structural
stability13 and experimental feasibility
of the 2D graphyne network. The presence of sp-hybridized C atoms
in these graphynes makes them relatively less favorable when compared
with graphene. However, the energetic stability of γ-, δ-,
and 6,6,12-graphynes is slightly higher than that of the recently
fabricated graphdiyne55 monolayer. This
implies that γ-, δ-, and 6,6,12-graphyne monolayers may
be synthesized using the experimental methods in the future. Furthermore,
γ-graphyne has higher energetic preference rather than that of δ-
and 6,6,12-graphynes. However, γ-graphyne is a narrow direct
band gap56 semiconductor. Hence, it is
highly inevitable to predict novel members with high energetic preference
and graphenelike electronic energy dispersion.

In the present
study, we have proposed a novel 2D carbon polymorph
using the state-of-the-art theoretical methods. The carbon polymorph
is mainly composed of carbon pentagons and acetylenic linkers. This
2D material has higher energetic preference than that of most of the
graphynes which are reported till date including δ- and 6,6,12-graphynes.
The comprehensive study on dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stabilities
exposes the prospects for the practical existence of this 2D material.
Furthermore, the same carbon sheet is furnished with esthetically
pleasing double distorted Dirac points and anisotropic charge carrier
mobilities. We have also studied the structural and electronic properties
of the bilayer of this 2D material. The most stable stacking mode
of the cp-graphyne bilayer shows self-doped Dirac points.

2 Computational Details
All calculations were performed using
the Vienna ab initio simulation
package57−59 within the framework of density functional theory
(DFT). The electron–electron interaction was calculated by
the generalized gradient approximation60 parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof. The electron–ion
interaction was described by the projector augmented wave61 method. The plane waves were extended with a
kinetic energy cutoff of 520 eV. A 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack62k-mesh was included in the
energy minimization of the 2D carbon lattice. The energy difference
between two consecutive steps was set to less than 10–8 eV in the self-consistent iterative technique. The residual Hellmann–Feynman
force was set to less than 10–3 eV/atom. The static
self-consistent calculations were performed with a denser mesh of
8 × 8 × 1 k-point set. The phonon band
spectrum was calculated using the open source Phonopy package.63 The thermal stability was analyzed by performing
the first-principles finite temperature molecular dynamics (FPMD)
simulations. The total simulation was carried out for 5 ps at room
temperature (300 K) with a time step of 1 fs using an NVT ensemble.
The optimal interlayer distance in all of the bilayers was explored
using van der Waals-corrected density functional theory (vdW-DF2).64 A vacuum of 15 Å was included along the z direction to avoid interlayer interactions.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Properties
This section
describes the structural properties of the novel 2D carbon allotrope.
The optimized crystal structure of the carbon pentagon-based 2D material
is presented in Figure 1a. This 2D material exhibits P4/mbm (D4h5) symmetry and belongs to the tetragonal
space group (space group no. 127). The equilibrium lattice parameters
of the unit cell of this 2D carbon allotrope are predicted to be a = b = 12.365 Å. Furthermore, the
unit cell is composed of 40 carbon atoms. Among these 40 C atoms,
20 are incorporated to form four five-membered rings and the remaining
C atoms are utilized to form 10 acetylenic linkers. The carbon pentagons
are joined together by the acetylenic linkers. Hence, we named this
novel 2D material cp-graphyne, which stands for carbon pentagons with
ethyne linkers. The cp-graphyne exhibits slightly altered bond lengths
and bond angles from the regular sp and sp2 bond parameters,
which are found in graphene and graphynes.50 For example, the calculated bond lengths are in the range of 1.44–1.46
and 1.23–1.38 Å around the five-membered rings and along
the acetylenic linker, respectively, as observed from Table 1. The central acetylenic-type
C–C bond is the shortest (1.23 Å) among all of the C–C
bonds of cp-graphyne. Furthermore, the bond angles are in the range
of 107–109 and 121–132° in the interior and exterior
of the carbon pentagon of cp-graphyne, respectively. Some of the acetylenic
linkers also slightly distorted from the linear structure and show
a bond angle of ∼168°. It is evident from Figure 1b that higher charge density
is accumulated at the middle of the acetylenic linker, followed by
its end C–C bonds and the carbon pentagons. This is in close
association with the C–C bond lengths in cp-graphyne. The Wyckoff
positions of six inequivalent C atoms of cp-graphyne are presented
in the Figure S1, Supporting Information.

3.2 Structural Stabilities
3.2.1 Energetic
Stability
The altered
bond lengths and bond angles of cp-graphyne increase the total energy,
which leads to suspect the structural stability of the system. Hence,
we have calculated the cohesive (Ec) and
formation (Ef) energies of cp-graphyne
to understand the structural stability. Furthermore, the cohesive
and formation energies of cp-graphyne are also compared with those
of previously reported 2D graphyne lattices to understand its relative
stability and thermodynamic feasibility. Results show that the cohesive
energy of cp-graphyne (−7.30 eV/atom) is higher than that of
all other previously reported graphyne systems, including α-
(−7.04 eV/atom), β- (−7.12 eV/atom), δ-
(−7.22 eV/atom), R- (−7.15 eV/atom),
and 6,6,12-graphyne (−7.23 eV/atom), square graphynes (−7.04
to −7.14 eV/atom), and graphdiyne (−7.20 eV/atom), and
closer to that of γ-graphyne (−7.33 eV/atom) (see Table S1). This indicates that cp-graphyne is
the strongly bonded carbon network when compared with the graphdiyne
monolayer and all other 2D graphynes (except γ-graphyne) included
in this study. Furthermore, the computed formation energies of some
of these graphyne layers are plotted with respect to the formation
energy of graphene in Figure 2a. It is important to mention here that large-area graphdiyne
films have been fabricated on the surface of copper using experimental
methods. Hence, we have considered the formation energy of the graphdiyne55 monolayer as a reference point (represented
by the black dashed line) to address the experimental feasibility
of all of these graphyne monolayers including cp-graphyne (see Figure 2a). It shows that
all other graphyne monolayers are energetically less favorable when
compared with the graphene. However, the experimental realization
of a graphyne system can be expected for those 2D lattices with the
formation energy lower than that of the graphdiyne monolayer. This
indicates that δ-, 6,6,12-, cp-, and γ-graphynes are energetically
more favorable than the graphdiyne monolayer and their practical applications
may be plausible in the future. In particular, cp-graphyne is energetically
more viable than the reference point by about 94 meV/atom, δ-graphyne,
by about 76 meV/atom, and 6,6,12-graphyne, by about 67 meV/atom. It
could be noted here that, indeed the γ-graphyne is slightly
favorable than cp-graphyne, it is a direct band gap semiconductor.
Hence, cp-graphyne can be considered as the first low-energy carbon
polymorph in the family of semimetallic graphynes (see Table S1).

special points, and (c) total energy fluctuations around a constant
value at 300 K.

3.2.2 Dynamic
Stability
The lattice dynamics
of cp-graphyne was analyzed by computing phonon band dispersion using
the supercell approach as implanted in the open source Phonopy package.
We have used a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell to calculate the vibrational
modes of cp-graphyne along the high-symmetry k-points
throughout the first Brillouin zone. It is clear from Figure 2b that the 2D lattice is free
from imaginary modes in the first Brillouin zone. This feature endorses
the dynamical stability of cp-graphyne.

3.2.3 Thermal
Stability
We have analyzed
the thermal stability of cp-graphyne by performing first-principles
molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations at room temperature for 5 ps.
The calculated results are presented in Figure 2c. It shows that the total energy is fluctuating
around a constant value throughout the simulation. Furthermore, the
snapshot taken at the end of simulation is depicted in Figure S2. It shows that the C atoms of cp-graphyne
are slightly displaced from their equilibrium positions in the course
of the simulation. However, the C–C bonds are rigid enough
to retain the original structure of cp-graphyne. This indicates that
cp-graphyne is thermally stable at room temperature.

3.2.4 Mechanical Stability
Finally, we
have tested the mechanical stability of cp-graphyne using density
functional theory-based methods. We have applied the in-plane tensile
strain along the uniaxial and biaxial directions to examine the mechanical
stability of cp-graphyne. The in-plane strain has increased in steps
of 1% by varying the equilibrium lattice constants of cp-graphyne.
The corresponding stress values are rescaled by Z/d0 to obtain the equivalent stress65−67 similar to the previous studies. Here, Z is the
vacuum length between the periodic images and d0 (3.6 Å) is the optimal interlayer distance between the
cp-graphyne layers in its 3D bulk structure. It is evident from Figure 3a that cp-graphyne
can withstand up to a maximum stress of 25 GPa, which occurs at 17%
of the uniaxial strain. On the other hand, the same sheet can sustain
up to a maximum stress of 32 GPa, which occurs at 11% of the biaxial
strain. The rupture of the C–C bond in the carbon pentagons
is the rationale behind the mechanical instability of cp-graphyne
after the 17% uniaxial and 11% biaxial strains, as evident from Figure S3. The strain calculations have also
been performed by giving small perturbations in the carbon positions
without any symmetry constrains to test the stability of cp-graphyne.
However, the 2D system is stable with the same geometrical features
and the uniaxial and biaxial mechanical strengths are not varied.
Furthermore, the mechanical stability of 2D materials can also be
estimated by evaluating the independent elastic stiffness tensor components.
According to the Born criteria,68 the elastic
constants of a mechanically stable tetragonal system need to satisfy
the following conditions: C11 > 0, C33 > 0, C44 >
0, C66 > 0, (C11 – C12) > 0, (C11 + C33 –
2C13) > 0, 2(C11 + C12) + C33 + 4C13 > 0.
It is evident from Table 2 that cp-graphyne satisfies all of the above-mentioned conditions.
These results corroborate the mechanical stability of cp-graphyne.
The estimated Young’s modulus (Y) of cp-graphyne
(81 GPa nm) is quite low when compared to that of graphene (347 N/m).
The low areal density (0.26 atom/Å2) and highly porous
nature of cp-graphyne are responsible for such a low Young’s
modulus. On the other hand, the Poisson’s ratio (v) of cp-graphyne (0.30) is comparable to that of graphynes69 and almost twice that of graphene. Furthermore,
we have also predicted the direction-dependent Young’s modulus
(Y(θ)) and Poisson’s ratio (v(θ)) using the method mentioned in the previous studies.70,71 Here, θ is the angle with respect to the positive x direction of the cp-graphyne sheet. It is evident from Figure 3b that the Young’s
modulus (Y(θ)) of cp-graphyne is maximum in
the axial directions and minimum at the angular bisectors of the axial
directions. This indicates that cp-graphyne is easily stretchable
along the diagonals of the unit cell rather than along the axial directions.
On the other hand, the behavior of Poisson’s ratio (v(θ)) is exactly opposite to the trend of Young’s
modulus (see Figure 3c). It can be noted here that the Poisson’s ratio for a perfectly
incompressible material is exactly equal to 0.5 for an isotropic system.
However, cp-graphyne has v(θ) > 0.5 along
certain
directions, which indicates the incompressibility of the same sheet
along such directions. Overall, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s
ratio of cp-graphyne are completely deviated from the circular behavior
in Figure 3b,c, respectively.
All of these results authenticate the anisotropic mechanical character
of cp-graphyne.

3.3 Electronic
Properties
In this section,
we present a detailed account on the electronic properties of cp-graphyne.
The results from the electronic structure calculations of cp-graphyne
are presented in Figure 4. Figure 4a depicts
the first Brillouin zone with the high-symmetry special points [Γ
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) → X (0.0, 0.5, 0.0) → M (0.5, 0.5, 0.0)
→ Γ (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)] along which the bands are plotted.
Interestingly, the maxima of VB and minima of CB contact at two different
off-symmetry points, such as D1 (0.000, 0.300, 0.000) and D2 (0.425,
0.425, 0.000) along the Γ → X and M → Γ
paths on the Fermi level, as shown in Figure 4b. The VB and CB exhibit linear band dispersion
around these contact points in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Furthermore,
we have calculated the 3D band structure of cp-graphyne to gain insights
into the linear dispersion in the hole and electronic energies. The
3D plots of VB and CB around contact points D1 and D2 are presented
in Figure 4c,d. They
indicate that the energies of the valence and conduction bands exhibit
conelike features around D1 and D2 in the proximity of the Fermi level.
These features emphasize that contact points D1 and D2 can be considered as Dirac points
similar to the Dirac point of graphene. Hence, cp-graphyne exhibits
double Dirac points in the first Brillouin zone.

Brillouin zone (shaded with red color) along which the bands are plotted.
(b) Two-dimensional electronic band structure. Three-dimensional electronic
band structure of VB and CB around Dirac points (c) D1 and (d) D2.
The Fermi level is set as zero in all cases.

However, the close inspection at the two pairs of Dirac cones
reveals
that the energy dispersion is asymmetric at both the Dirac points
similar to that in phagraphene, square graphynes, rectangular carbon allotropes,72Pmmm boron, and 6,6,12-graphyne.
We have computed the band slopes (∂E/∂k) and the corresponding Fermi velocities (vf) of cp-graphyne along different crystallographic directions.
The cp-graphyne exhibits the band slopes (∂E/∂kx) of ±10.68 eV Å,
which is equivalent to a Fermi velocity of 2.58 × 105 m/s for both holes and electrons along the kx direction. However, the corresponding values along the ky direction are found to be +21.56 eV Å
(VB), vfy = 5.20 × 105 m/s (for holes); −33.91 eV Å (VB), vfy = +8.20 × 105 m/s (for holes); and
±25.64 eV Å (CB), vfy = 6.20
× 105 m/s (for electrons) at Dirac point D1. Similarly,
the band slopes (∂E/∂k(Γ–M)) are predicted to be ±6.19 eV
Å (vf(Γ–M) = 1.50 ×
105 m/s, for holes) and −1.40 eV Å and +16.49
eV Å (vfy = 3.39 × 104 m/s and 3.98 × 105 m/s, for electrons) when approaching
Dirac point D2 from high-symmetry special points M and Γ. In
addition to this, the 2D contour plots of both valence and conduction
bands also substantiate that the energy distribution is asymmetric
around Dirac points D1 and D2 (see Figure S4). These results suggest that cp-graphyne contains two pairs of distorted
Dirac cones around Dirac points D1 and D2 in the vicinity of the Fermi
level. These distorted Dirac cones facilitate highly anisotropic electronic
properties in cp-graphyne. Overall, cp-graphyne has eight distorted
Dirac points (four pairs of D1 and D2) in the first Brillouin zone,
as given in Figure 4a. The four Dirac points either at D1 or at D2 are related to each
other by rotational symmetry (C4). Hence,
among the four pairs of distorted Dirac points, only a pair of Dirac
points is symmetrically independent.

We have computed the total
density of states (TDOS) and partial
density of states (PDOS) to understand the origin of linear band dispersion
around the Dirac points. The TDOS completely vanishes at the Fermi
level and linearly increases around the Fermi level, as indicated
in Figure 5a. This
feature also supports the presence of Dirac states and substantiates
the semimetallic nature of cp-graphyne. Furthermore, it is clear from
the PDOS that the pz states of C atoms are mainly responsible
for the formation of linear valence and conduction bands in the vicinity
of the Fermi level. The partial charge density plots corresponding
to VB and CB (see Figure 5b,c) also suggest that the π and π* orbitals of
C atoms are solely responsible for the formation of linear band dispersion
nearer to Dirac points D1. The partial charge density plots are almost
similar even for the other Dirac point that is located at D2 (see Figure S5).

3.4 Structural and Electronic Properties of Bilayers
Recently, the layered materials or van der Waals solids73,74 of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous monolayers have gained a
great deal of attention from the scientific community due to their
one-to-one effect on engineering the electronic properties of individual
monolayers. In this context, we have studied the different stacking
modes of cp-graphyne with one another. Initially, we have considered
AA-stacking mode, in which the atoms of one cp-graphyne monolayer
are exactly placed on those of another, as presented in Figure 6a. In addition to this, we
have also considered AC-stacking mode in which one monolayer is slightly
shifted horizontally with respect to another monolayer. We have glided
one of the cp-graphyne monolayers along the x direction
and y direction in steps of 2.06 Å (one-sixth
of the lattice constant) till the identical conformation has been
repeated. This technique almost covers all favorable stacking modes
including AB-stacking, which was shown in Figure 6b. Overall, the optimal interlayer distance
between the two cp-graphyne monolayers has been evaluated for one
AA-, one AB-, and 11 AC-stacking modes, as given in Figure S6. The most stable AC-stacking mode between two cp-graphyne
monolayers has been presented in Figure 6c. This is similar to one of the most stable
stacking modes Aa of the α-graphyne75 bilayer and also to that of β-graphyne.76 It is obvious that AA-stacking is not favorable
than AB or AC-stacking due to interelectronic repulsions. In the most
stable AC-staking mode, two cp-graphyne monolayers are stacked together
with a maximum binding energy of 42 meV/atom at an optimal interlayer
distance of 3.6 Å. Furthermore, we have also computed the electronic
band structure of the cp-graphyne bilayer and is presented in Figure 6d. The VB and CB
of the cp-graphyne bilayer crosses at two distinct points (D1′
and D2′) in the Γ → X high-symmetry line segment.
Furthermore, these two bands exhibit almost linear band dispersion
around the two crossing points, as indicated in Figure 6e. In addition to this, the 3D band picture
(see Figure 6f) of
VB and CB also confirms the presence of Dirac conelike features to
these bands around the crossing points. Hence, we conclude these crossing
points as Dirac-like points. The interlayer interaction between the
cp-graphyne monolayer may be responsible for the emergence of Dirac
cones in the double layer of cp-graphyne. Excitingly, the two Dirac-like
points are situated at above and below the Fermi level, indicating
the p-type and n-type self-doping character of the cp-graphyne bilayer.
As a result, the holes act as the charge carriers at Dirac point D1′,
whereas the electrons act as charge carriers at Dirac point D2′
even without doping effects. Hence, cp-graphyne may be a promising
2D material for high-speed electronic applications. It is important
to mention here that the synthetic accessibility is the major concern
to the graphyne-based research. However, dehydrotribenzo[12]annulenes,
dehydrotribenzo[18]annulenes, perethynylated expanded radialenes,
and cyclo[12]carbon are considered as the possible candidates for
the synthesis of small graphyne flakes77,78 using the
most promising metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, alkyne metathesis,
and templated synthesis techniques. In the same direction, [5]radialenes,
acetylenic scaffolds of cyclopentane, and cyclic carbon cluster di-anions
may serve as starting materials for the experimental synthesis of
cp-graphyne.

zero in all cases (carbon spheres are presented with different color
codes in (a)–(c) for clarity).

4 Conclusions
In this investigation,
a novel 2D carbon allotrope has been predicted
using the state-of-the-art theoretical methods. The ideal arrangement
of carbon pentagons and acetylenic linkers led to the development
of this 2D material. It utilizes both sp- and sp2-hybridized
C states similar to the other graphyne networks. Thus, this novel
2D carbon sheet is named cp-graphyne based on its structural features.
The structural stability is confirmed by the comprehensive investigation
on the dynamic, thermal, and mechanical properties of cp-graphyne.
The higher energetic favorability than that of the graphdiyne monolayer
corroborates the experimental feasibility of the cp-graphyne monolayer
in the future. Computed results show that double distorted Dirac points
and anisotropic carrier mobilities are the dominant features in the
electronic structure of cp-graphyne. Excitingly, a p- and n-type self-doping
character has been found in the electronic fingerprint of the cp-graphyne
bilayer.
