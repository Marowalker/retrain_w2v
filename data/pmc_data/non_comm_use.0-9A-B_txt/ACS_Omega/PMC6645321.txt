Quantitative
understanding of reactivity and stability for a chemical
species is fundamental to chemistry. The concept has undergone many
changes and additions throughout the history of chemistry, stemming
from the ideas such as Lewis acids and bases. For a given complexing
ligand (Lewis base) and a group of isovalent metal cations (Lewis
acids), the stability constants of metal–ligand (ML) complexes
can simply correlate to the known properties of metal ions [ionic
radii (rMn+), Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG°f,Mn+), and solvation energy (ΔG°s,Mn+)] by
2.303RT log KML = (α*MLΔG°f,Mn+ – β*MLrMn+ + γ*MLΔG°s,Mn+ – δ*ML), where the coefficients
(α*ML, β*ML, γ*ML, and intercept δ*ML) are determined by fitting
the equation to the existing experimental data. Coefficients β*ML and γ*ML have the same sign and are in
a linear relationship through the origin. Gibbs free energies of formation
of cations (ΔG°f,Mn+) are found to be natural indices for the softness or
hardness of metal cations, with positive values corresponding to soft
acids and negative values to hard acids. The coefficient α*ML is an index for the softness or hardness of a complexing
ligand. Proton (H+) with the softness index of zero is
a unique acid that has strong interactions with both soft and hard
bases. The stability energy resulting from the acid–base interactions
is determined by the term α*MLΔG°f,Mn+; a positive product
of α*ML and ΔG°f,Mn+ indicates that the acid–base
interaction between the metal cation and the complexing ligand stabilizes
the complex. The terms β*MLrMn+ and γ*MLΔG°s,Mn+, which
are related to ionic radii of metal cations, represent the steric
and solvation effects of the cations. The new softness indices proposed
here will help to understand the interactions of ligands (Lewis bases)
with metal cations (Lewis acids) and provide guidelines for engineering
materials with desired chemical reactivity and selectivity. The new
correlation can also enhance our ability for predicting the speciation,
mobility, and toxicity of heavy metals in the earth environments and
biological systems.

Introduction
Many chemical reactions
can be generalized as Lewis acid–base
reactions in which the Lewis acid is an electron acceptor and the
Lewis base is an electron donor.1,2 If Lewis acids are metal
cations, the Lewis bases are called ligands. A metal–ligand
complex formation can be generalized as 1  where
M is a Lewis acid that can accept electrons
and L is a Lewis base that can donate electrons (Figure 1). Stability of the Lewis acid–base
complex was tackled by pioneers such as Williams and Irving, who proposed
that stability of transition metal–ligand complexes were related
to ionic radii and the second ionization potentials of the metals
concerned (the Irving–Williams order).3 Much progress was made with the development of hard/soft acids/bases
(HSABs) principle by Pearson1,2 and its explanation
for observed stabilities in Lewis acid/base reactions. Later, Klopman
tried to quantify the HSAB principle by using terms from ionic interaction
(contribution from charge-controlled reaction) and covalent interaction
(contribution from frontier molecular orbital) through a generalization
of Fukuis frontier orbital’s density.4 Hancock and Martell5 summarized empirical
parameters for estimating stability constants of some acid–base
compound ligands based on HSAB principle by considering contributions
from ionic interactions (EA·EB), covalent bonding (CA·CB), and size effects (DA·DB) using
an equation 2  Parameters E and C are the tendency
of acid A and base B to undergo ionic
and covalent bonding, respectively. The method is very limited in
predicting stabilities of metal complexes.

Figure 1 Diagram schematically
showing metal–ligand (ML) complex
in water and different energy contributions to the formation of an
aqueous metal complex.

Parr and Pearson used the density functional theory (DFT)
to calculate
the absolute hardness of Lewis acids and bases.6 The absolute hardness (η) is the second derivative
of the energy with respect to the number of electrons with a fixed
external potential analogous to the absolute electronegativity. The
absolute softness is reciprocal value of hardness (1/η).7 The hardness/softness concept was supported by
the DFT calculations.8−10 However, the absolute hardness of acids and bases
cannot be directly used to calculate the stability constants of acid–base
complexes. Furthermore, there are still some exceptions to the definition
for acids such as H+ and Be2+.

Results and Discussion
We here report a linear free energy relationship that correlates
the stability constants of metal–ligand (ML) complexes to the
known properties of metal ions including ionic radius (rMn+), Gibbs free energy of
formation (ΔG°f,Mn+), and solvation energy (ΔG°s,Mn+). In this correlation, Gibbs
free energy of formation (ΔG°f,Mn+) of a cation is broken into two parts—the
solvation energy (ΔG°s,Mn+) and the nonsolvation energy (ΔG°n,Mn+) (see
the list of Symbols Used for details) 3  

The solvation energy of a cation can
be calculated with Born equation 4  where ε is the dielectric constant
of
water (78.47 at 25 °C). ΔG°s,Mn+ is negative. The parameter ωMn+ is the Born solvation coefficient
of the cation, which can be further related to the radius of the cation
(rMn+).11−13 The parameter ωMn+ is
the Born solvation coefficients for aqueous cations and can be calculated
by 4a  In eq 4a, ωabsH+ is the absolute
Born solvation coefficient of H+ (53.87 kcal/mol) and ωabsMn+ is the absolute
Born solvation coefficient of the cations with the effective electrostatic
radii of aqueous ions (re,Mn+). They can be calculated by 4b   4c  The solvation energies of
divalent and trivalent
cations have been calculated and tabulated (Table 1)12,13 using ionic radii provided
in refs (14−16).

a ADP = adenosine-5′-diphosphate;
H-ADP = protonated ADP that forms metal complexes in M–HL form.

b Radii of the cations are from
ref (15). The values
of log K metal complexes are from ref (17). All of the values were
determined at standard
state, except for ADP and H-ADP in ionic strength of 0.1. The stability
constant (log K = 4.08) for Be2+–oxalate was determined in ionic strength of 0.1 at 20 °C.
The predicted value should be very close to its real value in ionic
strength of 0.

c The values
of ΔGf of the cations are from refs (12, 16, 18), except for
Pt2+, Pd2+ from ref (19).

For
a given complexing ligand (Lewis base) and a group of isovalent
metal cations (Lewis acids), our correlation assumes that the total
free energy of a metal–ligand complex can be written as a linear
combination of three main contributors (Figure 1): (1) the interaction between the cation
and the ligand, which is characterized by the nonsolvation energy
(ΔG°n,Mn+), (2) the interaction between the cation and the surrounding
water, which is characterized by the solvation energy (ΔG°s,Mn+), and
(3) the size (rMn+) effect of the cation on coordination environments (the steric
effect) 5  The intercept bML is related to the strength of the complexing ligand L. Because ΔG°f,ML dominates
other terms, direct use of eq 5 for correlation may falsely lead to a high correlation coefficient
between the quantities on the two sides of the equation. Therefore,
it is preferable to use stability constants of metal complexes (log KML) for correlation. The log KML can be expressed in terms of the free energy
of reactants (Mn+ and L) and products
(ML) 6  where ΔG°f,L is Gibbs free energy of formation of a ligand L. Substituting eq 5 into eq 6, we obtain 7  where δ*ML = bML –
ΔG°f,L. Finally, we have 8  where α*ML = (1 – aML) and γ*ML = (aML – cML).

The
coefficients (α*ML, β*ML,
γ*ML) and intercept δ*ML can be
calculated by fitting eq 8 to existing experimental data for each ligand.

A large body
of stability constants and Gibbs free energies of
formation for metal–ligand complexes have been documented.16−18Equation 8 closely
fits the existing experimental data for all of the metal complex families,
even very complicated M–humate complexes (Figure 2D) (detail values for M–humate
and M–fulvic acid complexes are listed in Supporting Information). Some selected metal-complex families
are listed in Table 1. Figure 2 illustrates
the differences between the experimental and the calculated values
using eq 8. The discrepancies
between the calculated and experimental data are within ±0.7
kcal/mol (or ∼0.5 log unit) for the majority of the
data, especially for well-studied ligands. Previously proposed linear
free energy relationship based on metals binding to one ligand (e.g.,
OH–) and metals binding to other ligand.20 The difference between the experimentally measured
value and predicted value is also large (∼1–2 log
units).20

Figure 2 Diagrams showing the differences between
experimental (vertical
axis) and calculated log K values (horizontal
axis) for four M2+–ligand families: M2+–oxalate (A), M2+–ADP (B), protonated ADP,
or M2+–H-ADP (C), and complicated M2+–humate complexes (D), respectively.

Interestingly, as shown in Figure 3, Gibbs free energies of formation of cations
(ΔG°f,Mn+) are
natural indices for the hardness/softness of metal cations (Lewis
acids). Cations with positive ΔG°f,Mn+ values are soft acids, and
those with negative ΔG°f,Mn+ values are hard acids (Figure 3). Cations with a high positive ΔG°f,Mn+ values
tend not to lose electrons but to share them: softness is coincidentally
related to the tendency of a complex to form covalent bonds. The new
index is better than the empirical parameter Δβ (=log β0MF – log β0MCl) used for defining cation types like (a)-type, (b)-type,
and borderline cations.21 Previously proposed
criteria can qualitatively categorize metal cations into three groups,
hard acids (or type A metal cations), borderline (or intermediate
cations), and hard acids (or B type metal cations).1,21 The
product of the term α*MLΔG°f,Mn+ is related to
the stability of a metal–ligand complex. Both positive and
both negative values of α*ML and ΔG°f,Mn+ will result in
a positive product and hence stabilize the metal–ligand complex.
It is then logical to postulate that the coefficient α*ML is an index for the hardness/softness of ligands (Lewis
bases). Positive α*ML values indicate soft bases,
and the negative α*ML values indicate hard bases.

Figure 3 Gibbs
free energy of formations (G°f,Mn+) as natural indices for the softness
of Lewis acids. The values of ΔGf of the cations are taken from refs (12, 16, 18), except for Bi3+ from
ref (22), Ti3+ from ref (23), Pu3+, Np3+, and Am3+ from refs (13, 24), and Pt2+, Pd2+ from
ref (19). See Table 1 for detail values
of divalent cations.

Table 2 lists
the
softness of some bases according to their α*ML values.
Hard bases (e.g., F– with α*ML =
−0.0101) have lower α*ML values than that
of soft bases (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) with α*ML = 0.0931) in divalent metal-complex families. For a ligand
with coefficient α*ML close to 0 (e.g., Cl– with α*ML = 0.0036), the relative selectivity for
metal cations is mainly determined by the ionic radii of the cations.
If both coefficients α*ML and γ*ML are close to 0 (e.g., formic acid, and SO42), the ligand will have no selectivity for metal cations. In general,
the overall stability constants are determined by both the ionic radii
of metal cations and the softness of cations (acids) and ligands (bases).
The new relationship can quantitatively explain the Irving–Williams
order. The coefficient δ*ML relates to the complexing
strength of a ligand with metals. A large negative δ*ML value indicates a strong chelating ability of the ligand if other
coefficients are same. Both coefficients β*ML and
γ*ML have the same sign (Table 2). Positive β*ML or γ*ML values indicate that increasing cation size will lower the
stability of complex in a ML family (e.g., M2+–EDTA
family, see Table 2), whereas negative β*ML or γ*ML values indicate that increasing cation size will increase the stability
of metal complex in a ML family (e.g., Pb2+ in M2+–humate family with α*ML = 0.0285, see Figure 2D, Table S1, and Table 2). Some bases (like phosphoric acids) and diazoles have very
low or zero values of β*ML and γ*ML (Table 2). This indicates
that the size effect from the cations is diminished for such kinds
of bases. It is proposed that the lesser hydrophilic (or more hydrophobic)
nature of the bases causes this phenomenon.

According to Table 2, EDTA is one of the strongest chelating
agents for divalent metals.
The softness of bases follows the order of cyanide > sulfide (S2–) > ethylenediamine > cysteine > glycine
> EDTA >
O2– > histidine > ammonia > OH– > carboxylic acids > Cl– > sulfuric acid
> F– > CO32– >
iodic acid.
Based on the obtained softness indices (Table 2), increasing the number of soft bases (like
Cl, histidine, or ammonia) bonded to metal cations generally results
in an even softer ligand, that is, Cl2 in M–L2 is softer than Cl in M–L. Increasing the number of
hard bases (like F) bonded to metal cations generally results in an
even harder ligand, that is, F2 in M–L2 is harder than F in M–L (Table 2). Softness also changes based on the arrangement
of atoms in isomers. For instance, andenosine monophosphate (AMP-5′)
is the precursor to ADP, and the biologically important AMP has two
other isomers: AMP-2′ (α*ML = 0.0111) and
AMP-3′ (α*ML = 0.0100). AMP-5′ is the
softest (α*ML = 0.0119) among the three isomers (Table 2). The new softness
indices for Lewis bases can serve as a guideline for designing new
functional materials or even engineered proteins with chemical selectivity
because each individual functional group (like amine, carboxylic group,
carbonate, and phosphate) has its own softness value.

Unlike
the hardness parameters (η) proposed by Parr and Pearson,6 the new softness (or
hardness) indices have positive and negative signs, which clearly
indicate the reaction tendencies between Lewis acids and Lewis bases.
The product of the acid softness (ΔG°f,Mn+) and base softness (α*ML) or the term of α*MLΔG°f,Mn+ corresponds to
the acid–base interaction energy. By plotting the α*MLΔG°f,Mn+ term against the Lewis acid softness ΔG°f,Mn+, we
can clearly see that the stability energies due to the acid–base
interactions follow lines with different slopes (α*ML) (Figure 4). Soft
bases follow lines with positive slopes, and hard bases follow lines
with negative slopes. The areas labeled “verboten” are
beyond the softness of the softest base and the hardness of the hardest
base. The four quadrants in the plot correspond to soft acid–soft
base interaction (quadrant I), hard acid–hard base interaction
(quadrant II), hard acid–soft base interaction (quadrant III),
and soft acid–hard base interaction (quadrant IV). The acid–base
interaction energy not only quantitatively explains Pearson’s
statement of “hard acids prefer to associate with hard bases,
and soft acids prefer to associate with soft bases”,2,30 but also accounts for all other reactions of varying hardness/softness.

illustrating Lewis acid–base interaction, or acid–base
stability energies in term of α*ΔG°f,Mn+ vs ΔG°f,Mn+ plot. The proton
(H+) is at the unique position of the origin. The softness
of a base (ligand) is gauged with the slope of α*ΔG°f,Mn+ vs ΔG°f,Mn+ with
a positive slope for a soft base. A positive α*ΔG°f,Mn+ value
indicates a preferential complexation between the acid and the base.

Hydrogen has puzzled scientists
in the past in their explanations
of both its role as a hard or a soft cation, and its effect on bases/ligands.
Previous HSAB models were not able to qualitatively explain its behavior,
much less quantify it. To briefly illustrate, H+ can bond
to F–, which is very hard. H+ is also
known to bond to S2–, a soft base, forming HS– or H2S. So, hydrogen as a cation exhibits
both hard and soft behaviors depending on the ligand. On an arbitrary
scale, such a quantification is quite impossible, as H+ would have to appear twice—two contradicting facts. Our equation
and new softness indices appropriately explain hydrogen’s behavior
by positioning its softness at 0. This point is equally positive as
it is negative, which allows it to react with both hard and soft bases,
and forms stable bonds.

The second unique feature of hydrogen
is its effect on ligands,
or more specifically, what happens when a ligand is protonated. It
is observed that protonated ligands become less soft with the addition
of protons, such as ML complexes and MHL complexes for ATP, ADP, and
methylenephosphonic acid (Table 2). In the M–ADP family, the Cu–ADP complex
is the strongest. The order of binding strength is reversed in the
M–H-ADP family (Figure 2) because protonated ADP (H-ADP) becomes a hard base (Table 2), and its coefficients
β*ML and γ*ML become negative. OH– may be considered as protonated O2– in this regard. This phenomenon is difficult to explain, but is
nevertheless observable. We currently believe that hydrogen changes
the covalency of a bond between cation and ligand. For instance, in
an ideal covalent metal–ligand complex, the electrons in a
neutral position receive equal forces from both nuclei. If a proton
with a high electron affinity is added to a ligand, the electron in
the neutral position moves toward the protonated side, “pinching
off” the bond. The compound is now less covalent, which implies
that it is less soft than its deprotonated base.

Previous models
also had trouble explaining the behavior of beryllium
(Be2+). Its family exhibits ionic properties (a general
indicator of a hardness) when it reacts with Cl–. According to the previous charge over radius rule, Be2+, which is both small and highly charged, should be more ionic and
thus harder than other divalent cations in the alkali earth group.
BeCl2, however, is more covalent than others in its family,
as it is observed to be soluble in organic solvents, and the molten
material is a poor conductor.31 The reason
as explained is that because Be2+ is so small and also
highly charged, it is capable of pulling enough electrons toward it
to form a quasi-covalent structure. Charge over radius could not be
extended to calculate the hardness of Be2+, and likewise
rules devised around the Be2+ case could not be used to
define other Lewis acids. Based on Pearson–Klopman HSAB model,
Be2+ is considered an anomaly and exception. As we have
found, the key to softness or hardness is not solely charge over radius,
but the Gibbs free energy of formation, ΔG°f,Mn+. Be2+ has the
highest ΔG°f,Mn+ value among the alkali earth elements (Table 1); therefore, it is softer than
all of the other divalent cations in the alkali earth group. However,
the charge/radius cannot be ignored. In our equation, the terms of
β*MLrMn+ (steric effect) and γ*MLΔG°s,Mn+ (solvation
effect) still account for this. Ignoring the size effect terms can
cause major discrepancies when cations are very small (e.g., Be2+) because the solvation energy is proportional to the reciprocal
value of ionic radius.11 Our equation produces
the results for Be2+–ligand complexes that are difficult
to be measured, consistent with the experimental data (Tables 1 and S1, Figure S1).

If we plot the values of β*ML against γ*ML, then a linear relationship between
β*ML and γ*ML values is displayed
(Figure 5) 9  The straight line passes through the origin
(Figure 5), which indicates
that β*ML and γ*ML are not independent.
The value of slope
is about 81.5 kcal/Å. The slope applies to all of the divalent
metal–ligand complexes in a given solvent, water in this case.
The slope (or “charge-solvent parameter”) corresponds
to the strength of the coordination field around the cation in a given
solvent. Equation 9 for
divalent cations may be modified as 10a  or 10b  The new equation will help us better understand
the hardness/softness of Lewis acids and bases. It can also predict
the unknown thermodynamic data based on a limited number of the existing
measurements, and this equation can also be used to check the internal
consistency of the thermodynamic databases. It is essential to have
reliable data for metal–ligand complexes to evaluate the impact
of pollutants on water, soils, and biological systems, as metal complexation
with various inorganic or organic ligands in aqueous solutions directly
controls the solubility, sorption, and toxicity of metals including
radionuclides in natural environments. The effectiveness of these
calculations heavily depends on the completeness and quality of the
thermodynamic databases on which the calculations are based.32,33 The equation can also be used to predict M3+–ligand
bindings and metal–protein bindings, which, in turn, can be
used in the future for designing metal-based anticancer drugs like
Ru3+ compounds34,35 and microbe–mineral
interactions in natural environments.36,37
