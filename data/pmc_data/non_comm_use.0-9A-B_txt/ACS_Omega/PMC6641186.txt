The possibility of designing a solvent/reagent
for Wittig reactions
from basic phosphonium salts is explored theoretically. In the suggested
R4P+PhO– and Ph3PR+PhO– ionic liquids (ILs), the phenolate
anion is prone to remove the α-proton from the alkyl chains,
forming a phosphorous ylide. Significant hydrogen bonding between
the oxygen atoms of the anions and α-hydrogen atoms of the cations
were found by molecular dynamics simulations of these substances;
therefore, proton transfer between the two ions is inherently supported
by the structure of the liquid as well. The subsequent steps of the
Wittig reaction from the phosphorous ylide were also found to be energetically
possible. The mesoscopic structure of these materials exhibits a significant
segregation into polar and nonpolar domains, which may also allow
an easy dissolution of the substrates. The formation of a pentacoordinated
phosphorous derivative through P–O bond formation was found
to be also possible in the gas phase for both kind of compounds. Accordingly,
having such basic anions in phosphonium-based ILs may produce such
a neutral and therefore volatile species, which may hold further significant
applications for these solvents in ion-exchange and separation techniques
and in synthesis.

Introduction
The Wittig reaction
continues to be of high importance in organic
syntheses,1−5 as it is a convenient and versatile method for forming C=C
double bonds, in many cases with good to excellent stereoselectivity.
Among the many possible solvents that were applied in such reactions,
ionic liquids (ILs) have shown great potential,6,7 similar
to that in other catalytic transformations.8−10 The main advantage
of using such an ionic solvent in Wittig reactions was the easier
separation of the alkene and the phosphine oxide side product, whereas
the reuse of the solvent was also found to be more efficient.6

Regarding the connection between Wittig
reactions and ILs it is
important to point out some of the chemical similarities between the
related compounds. As shown in Figure 1, the Wittig reaction is initiated by the deprotonation
of a suitable quaternary phosphonium cation at its α-position
and the thereby formed phosphorous ylide reacts with the carbonyl
derivative. On the other hand, phosphonium salts are widely applied
as ILs, also as solvents in synthesis.8−12 Indeed, it has been reported that by dissolving strong
bases in phosphonium-based ILs, the cation can be deprotonated to
phosphorous ylides, which was observed by nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy in the solution.13,14 In tetraalkylphosphonium-phenolate
and -azolide ILs, the anion itself has a significant inherent basicity.15,16 Although these ILs were designed for physical absorption of CO2, chemisorption in a small amount via an intriguing carboxylation
at the α-carbon atom of the cation occurred (Figure 2).15,16 The presence of this product could only be explained by the spontaneous
formation of phosphorous ylides in the solution, similarly to the
carbene-like reactivity of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium acetate ILs.17−23 The reaction has also been investigated in detail by static density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, proving the feasibility of the
cation’s CO2 absorption potential via the formation
of phosphorous ylides.16

Figure 1 Mechanism of the Wittig
reaction. For the sake of clarity, the
possible stereochemical issues are omitted.

Figure 2 Chemical CO2 absorption by the cation in [P66614][PhO] and [P66614][2-CNPyr] ILs.15,16 The product suggests the involvement of the ylide, which was later
proven by DFT calculations.16

Accordingly, it seems possible to access the chemistry
of phosphorous
ylides directly from the IL solvents, including the Wittig reaction.
If these reactions were available from the phosphonium ILs with basic
anions, then during the application of these solvents as absorbents
for CO2 the presence of carbonyl derivatives is necessary
to avoid to prevent the degradation of the liquid. This is especially
important to consider in the treatment of waste gases with incomplete
combustion, in which partially oxidized carbon derivatives, such as
aldehydes or ketones can be present. Thus, for CO2 absorption
processes, the potential of the solvent to undergo a Wittig reaction
must be characterized.

Even more importantly, exploiting this
chemical relationship between
the Wittig reagents and ILs might allow the combination of the advantageous
properties of these two chemistries, wherein the use of the reagent
also as a solvent can, if the counterions are properly chosen, enable
a greener process. In such an attempt, the use of an inherently basic
IL shows clear advantages because the need for an external base, and
therefore an extra component in the synthesis can be also avoided.
The aforementioned family of phosphonium-phenolate and -imidazolide
ILs could be an ideal choice for designing Wittig reagent solvents
as a synthetically already available starting point.

The generally
used tetraalkylphosphonium ILs that are substituted
with more than one kind of side chain on the phosphorous can provide
more than one possible product, which should be avoided in an efficient
synthetic approach. This obstacle can be, however, easily overcome
by employing phosphonium salts with four equivalent alkyl chains on
the phosphorous atom. Another possible approach is to derive the IL
cation from triphenylphosphine through alkylation, resulting in the
most widely applied Wittig reagent, alkyl-triphenylphosphonium salts.
Alkyl-triphenylphosphonium tosylate ILs have been investigated24,25 and were found to be excellent reaction media for hydroformylation
reactions.25 Moreover, alkyl-triphenylphosphonium
cations are generally preferred for Wittig reactions as well, offering
also the lack of variance in the possible products because there is
only one transferable group at the phosphorous atom. Thus, while having
the aforementioned advantageous solvent properties, the reactivity
of these compounds is also promising for the present purposes.

In this theoretical contribution, we evaluate whether basic phosphonium-salt
ILs can undergo a Wittig reaction, which might result in an efficient,
solventless synthetic pathway for this synthetically highly important
chemical transformation, whereas the information gathered here also
provides a better understanding on the analogous ILs used as CO2 absorbents. To this end, according to the discussion above,
we will investigate two groups of compounds: R4P+OPh– and Ph3PR+OPh– ILs, wherein R is ethyl, butyl, hexyl, or octyl. We will assess
the reactivity of these ILs in the Wittig reactions by exploring the
corresponding reaction energy profiles, and we will also characterize
their liquid properties, providing a more detailed, multiscalar view
on the structure of these ILs.

Results and Discussion
To design
an IL solvent that is a precursor and base in the Wittig
reaction, one must assess the possibility of a proton transfer, feasibility
of the reaction with different substrates, and also liquid structure
and dynamics. First, the proton transfer was investigated by static
quantum chemical calculations on an ion pair of each IL in a solvent
model. To avoid the high number of conformations, and to allow the
highly accurate coupled cluster calculations, the nonreacting aliphatic
side chains were substituted by methyl groups, whereas the alkyl group
that is directly involved in the proton transfer and Wittig reaction
was modeled by a methyl and an ethyl group. Because the spectator
alkyl substituents are far from the reaction site, the effect of this
simplification should be minimal. Similarly, the electronic effect
of the methyl group on the reacting methylene moiety should not be
very different from that of the longer side chains, and therefore
the present models will provide realistic results.

Interestingly,
all of the investigated IL ion pairs can rearrange
in a manner that a bond is formed between the phosphorous and oxygen
atoms, forming a pentacoordinated phosphorous derivative. Such structures
have not yet been observed in the ILs. The formation of this species
is driven by the strength of the P-O bond and in the gas phase also
by a decrease in the dipole moment, which sums up to a significant
stabilization of 20–30 kJ mol–1 (Table 1). Clearly, the decrease
in polarity will be energetically less favorable in an ionic26,27 or polar environment, and indeed, by applying a conductor-like screening
model for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS) to represent tetrahydrofuran
(THF) or the IL, the P-O bond formation is only slightly exothermic
for the Ph3PR+PhO– (R = Me,
Et) ILs and even endothermic for Me3PR+PhO– (R = Me, Et). Accordingly, in the liquid phase, the
formation of the corresponding nonionic pentacoordinated phosphorous
derivative is unfavorable for the R4P+ derivatives,
but it is available in the presence of the bulky phenyl groups on
the phosphorous atom, shielding the P–O bond from the apparently
dissociating polar environment. Thus, these calculations indicate
that the Ph3PR+PhO– salts
are partly nonionic (Table 1).

Because ILs generally evaporate
as single ion pairs,28−30 these results may have significant practical consequences.
Because
of the availability of these less polar structures in the liquid and
stabilization31,32 of the ion pairs by the formation
of these low-energy compounds in the gas phase, it might make the
evaporation of the phosphonium-based ILs with basic/nucleophilic anions
more facile. It would also be interesting to see whether this phenomenon
could be applied in ion exchange or separation processes on the basis
of the different affinities of the anions to form bonds with the phosphorous
atoms.

In the ionic isomer, a hydrogen bond between the oxygen
atom of
the anion and the α-hydrogen atom of the cation can be observed
(Figure 3). Thus, the proton that has to be mobile for the formation
of the phosphorous ylide (and hence for the Wittig reaction) is already
interacting strongly with the basic anion. The proton transfer in
the ionic isomer occurs via a relatively low barrier, resulting in 3. In 3, a hydrogen bond is present between the
phosphorous ylide and phenol. In agreement with the trends in proton
affinities of the corresponding ylides,33,34 the relative
energy of this structure varies significantly with the substituents
on the phosphorous: The presence of the phenyl groups stabilizes the
ylide–PhOH complex compared with the ion pair, whereas the
exchange of a hydrogen atom at the P-CH2– unit to a methyl group destabilizes
the ylide–PhOH hydrogen-bonded assembly.

Figure 3 Numbering and ball-and-stick
figures of the structures involved
in the formation of phosphorous ylides from the phosphonium phenolate
ILs (orange: carbon, yellow: phosphorous, red: oxygen, and white:
hydrogen). For the relative Gibbs free energies at 298.15 K see Table 1, and for the data
at 420 K, the SI. Please note that in the
energy of the structures, 1–4, an
infinitely separated PhO– ion is also included.

The Wittig reaction requires a
bond formation between the carbon
atom of the ylide and the carbonyl derivative substrate; therefore,
the hydrogen bond donor phenol is clearly hindering the reaction.
Accordingly, the reaction requires the dissociation of 3 into the free ylide and phenol. Despite the high basicity of the
ylide and its related high hydrogen bond acceptor strength, the dissociation
is exothermic (ca. −10–30 kJ mol–1, see Table 1). Considering
solvent effects makes the dissociation less favorable. However, in
the liquid, the phenolate anion can form a very strong hydrogen bonding
interaction with phenol (similar to the acetate-acetic acid system
in analogous reactions18,20), which stabilizes the dissociated
species (cf. 4 and 4′ in Table 1). Accordingly, the
free ylide and the phenol–phenolate complex lie only somewhat
higher in Gibbs free energy compared with the ion pair itself for
the Me3PR+PhO– structures,
and slightly lower for the Ph3PR+PhO– compounds. Clearly, assuming the formation of the phenol–phenolate
complex, the availability of the phenolate anion to deprotonate further
phosphonium cations is reduced, and therefore an upper limit of 50%
is expected for the conversion, similar to that of the analogous reaction
of imidazolium acetate ILs with CO2.20

The phosphorous ylides formed in the process described
above should
easily react with the substrate if the reaction is to occur in an
applicable manner. Although the mechanism of the Wittig reaction is
well known,35,36 IL ions have not yet been considered
as starting materials, neither the effects of the ionic solvent on
the reaction mechanism. Thus, we performed a series of calculations
on the Gibbs free energy profile of the full reaction mechanism for
all four model systems, Me3PR+PhO− and Ph3PR+PhO− (R = Me,
Et), with a COSMO-RS correction for the solvent effects of the IL.
To provide a comparison for the solvent effects, we also performed
these calculations with THF, which is often applied as a medium in
the Wittig reaction.

The reaction follows the path that has
been explored earlier35 (see Figure 1): First, the initial van der
Waals complex 5 is formed. From 5, the [2
+ 2] cycloaddition occurs
to give the oxaphosphetane intermediate. Oxaphosphetane undergoes
a Berry pseudorotation, relocating the P–C bond to the axial
position, which allows the last step, cycloelimination into the products.
The reaction-energy profile for the simplest example is shown in Figure 4, whereas the detailed
energetic data can be found in Tables 2–5.

c Reaction Gibbs free energy profile
for the formation of the cis structure.

Apparently, the Gibbs free energy of the van der Waals
complex
is higher than that of the separated ylide and substrate by ca. 20
kJ mol–1 in all cases, which is due to the unfavorable
entropy effects of the association, compensating the weak attraction
between these molecules. From this complex, the reaction often follows
a downhill path without a barrier to the oxaphosphetane, as the transition
state, TS5→6, found on the potential energy surface has a lower Gibbs free energy
than that of the initial van der Waals complex due to the differences
in the E → G thermal correction values applied after the geometry
optimization. The formation of the oxaphosphetane is highly exergonic;
the relative Gibbs free energy of this intermediate is significantly
lower than that of the ion pair and the isolated substrate (Table 1). The reaction Gibbs
free energy shows clear substituent effects, as starting from the
Me3PR+PhO– ILs the formation
of the oxaphosphetane is less favorable energetically by ca. 20 kJ
mol–1 than in the case of the Ph3PR+PhO– derivatives, whereas introducing a
longer ethyl side chain also shows some increase in the reaction Gibbs
free energies (Tables 2–5). Comparing the results for the
THF and IL models, it is apparent that although in THF the reaction
is more exergonic by ca. 10 (Ph3PR+PhO– derivatives) and 15 kJ mol–1 (Me3PR+PhO– derivatives), the ionic solvent does
not diminish the driving force of the reaction. Depending on the substituents
of the carbonyl moiety of the substrate, the relative Gibbs free energy
of the oxaphosphetane with respect to that of the ion pair and the
separated substrate also varies significantly, by ca. 40 kJ mol–1 for each IL. Interestingly, the least exergonic reactions
were found with acetophenone for all ILs, which should be due to combined
stabilization of the +I effect of the methyl group
and the π-conjugation between the phenyl group and the carbonyl
unit. According to the reaction energy profiles obtained for all considered
systems, the reaction of the solvent with a carbonyl compound should
result readily in an oxaphosphetane.

The formation of oxaphosphetane
determines stereochemistry of the
product and thus the stereoselectivity of the process. For a highly
stereoselective reaction, the barriers of the two paths that lead
to the two products should be significantly different. However, in
this case, the oxaphosphetane derivatives are all formed in a reaction
step with low barriers (between 0 and ca. 40 kJ mol–1), and the differences in the barrier heights between the paths that
result eventually in cis or trans products are generally only 1–2
kJ mol–1 (see SI). Accordingly,
these results do not indicate any significant selectivity for the
Wittig reactions considered here.

The elusive transition states
of the Berry pseudorotation were
not located, but because this process is known to occur via a very
low-energy transition state,35 the lack
of this barrier will not affect the conclusions of the present study.
In many cases, oxaphosphetane isomer 7, with an axial
P-C bond (which is, as mentioned above, required for the cycloelimination),
was not found on the potential energy surface. After failing to optimize
these structures from tentatively constructed geometries, we also
tried to locate them by starting from the vicinity of the transition
state TS7→8. In all of these attempts, the geometry converged again into structure 6, with the P-O bond in an axial position. These findings
can be rationalized, as these two isomers are not located in two separate
minima on the potential energy surface; hence, the Berry pseudorotation
and cycloelimination occur as a single step in the reaction mechanism.
This reasoning is supported by the fact that 7, when
found, is in all cases less stable than 6 by 10–20
kJ mol–1.

TS7→8 exhibits
the highest Gibbs free energy among all of the transition states and
minima that were located on the potential energy surface. The rate-limiting
step of the Wittig reaction is the cycloelimination; since, the energy
difference between 6 and TS7→8 provides the highest barrier. Apparently,
the barriers are in the range of 80–130 kJ mol–1, depending on mostly the substituents on the phosphorous atom rather
than on those on the carbonyl derivative. The Ph3PR+PhO– derivatives showed significantly lower
barriers than those of the Me3PR+PhO– salts, which is in clear agreement with the preference in the experiments
to choose triphenylphosphonium salts for the Wittig reactions. Considering
that the rate-determining step in this reaction is the cycloelimination,
wherein the anion does not play a role, the present reaction should
behave similarly to the other Wittig reactions in the ILs. Knowing
that such synthetic approaches have already been published before,6,7 it is reasonable to expect that the ILs investigated here would
undergo the Wittig reactions, in agreement with the finding that the
activation Gibbs free energies mentioned above are moderate. This
is further supported by the fact that the differences between the
barriers in THF and the IL for each system is marginal, generally
within 1–2 kJ mol–1, in good agreement with
the observation that the ILs are efficient solvents for Wittig reactions,6,7 similar to THF.3−5 The relative energy of the product has lower energy
and Gibbs free energy than those of any intermediate in all cases
and in both solvents, which provides the necessary driving force for
the reaction.

The results above indicate that the Me3PR+PhO– and Ph3PR+PhO– derivatives can be applied as reagents in
the Wittig reaction. However,
to be able to use these compounds also as solvents for the reaction,
the liquid structures must also be characterized to ensure that they
are indeed ILs. To this end, we performed classical molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations on a series of compounds, R4P+PhO– and Ph3PR+PhO– (wherein R = Et, Pr, Bu, Hexyl, Octyl). Because ILs are often applied
in a wide range of temperatures and because the present ILs (especially
the Ph3PR+PhO– derivatives)
might be viscous at ambient conditions, we performed the calculations
at two different temperatures, 298.15 and 420 K. Heating might result
in the evaporation of the aldehyde substrate from the solvent, which
can be counteracted by applying pressure to the system, but in the
case of aldehydes with sufficiently large substituents, this should
not be an issue, as already, for example, cyclohexanone has a boiling
point of 429 K. Clearly, we did not investigate in the present article
all of the possible substrates for the Wittig reaction in these ILs,
but the energetically most relevant electronic effects are fully covered
above by the three substituents that we considered (H, CH3, Ph); therefore, the conclusions here should be transferrable to
other substrates as well.

Although the structure exhibited only
a slight change upon heating,
the dynamic properties varied greatly. The data are shown in Table 6. Interestingly, the
obtained viscosities are low; all are in the range of 1–3 mPa
s, comparable to that of room-temperature water. At the higher temperature,
the viscosities are notably lower, occasionally half of those at room
temperature. Clearly, taking the absolute values for viscosities obtained
from MD must be treated carefully, but the trends can nevertheless
be discussed. The R4P+PhO– ILs exhibit an increasing viscosity due to the longer alkyl chains,
whereas the Ph3PR+PhO– ILs
do not show a clear trend in their viscosities. The diffusion constants
also show a moderate ion mobility at the lower temperature, which
is increased by 2 orders of magnitude at the higher temperature (Table 6). Interestingly,
the diffusion constants and viscosities show a completely different
trend, which can be explained by the facile deformation of the longer
side chains by sheer forces, whereas the overall center of mass of
the larger cations diffuses slower.

The data obtained from the MD simulations
allow us not only to
assess the aforementioned properties but also to gain a molecular
and mesoscopic level37−39 insight into the structure of these liquids. The
formation of the pentacoordinated species, 1, is not
possible in a classical MD environment because the bond-breaking and
bond-formation processes are not described in the empirical potentials
applied there. Although in ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations it is possible
to describe the electronic structure explicitly and therefore the
formation of the aforementioned P–O bond in 1 may
be observed, the computational demand of these simulations prohibit
the treatment of the bulk liquid phase of the large molecules that
we investigated here. Thus, to check the availability of 1 in an explicit and dynamic liquid model, we performed AIMD simulations
on an IL consisting of smaller cations, Et3PBu+PhO–. This IL is applied by Brennecke and co-workers
in CO2 absorption and therefore is of practical use. The
radial pair distribution function (RDF) for the P-O correlation shows
a high first peak (Figure 5), but only at ca. 4 Å, which is too long a distance
for a covalent bond. This suggests that in this particular liquid
the formation of 1 is not very frequent, which is in
good agreement with the results of the static quantum chemical calculations
for Me3PR+PhO– (R = Me, Et),
shown in Table 1.

pair correlation functions for the P–O distances
in the AIMD calculation of Et3PBu+PhO– (see Models and Methods section).

Hydrogen bonding is usually an
important feature of ILs.40−43 In these cases, it is especially so because as it
has been shown
above, hydrogen-bond formation between the IL anion and cation is
the starting point for the proton transfer that is necessary for the
Wittig reaction. Hydrogen bonding is most relevant between the oxygen
atom of the phenolate and partially most positive α-hydrogen
atoms of the cation. Indeed, as it can be seen by the presence of
the first peaks of the RDFs with a relevant height (g(r) > 1), at short distances in Figure 6 (above), the hydrogen bonding
in these liquids is a characteristic feature as well. Interestingly,
the hydrogen bonding is more expressed for the R4P+ cations than for the Ph3PR+ derivatives,
which is apparently due to the fact that in the latter cases the positively
polarized hydrogen atoms at the phenyl groups compete for these interaction
sites. The g(r) values show a significant
increase at the first peaks when introducing the longest hexyl and
octyl side chains. This sudden increase is possibly due to the increased
microheterogeneity in these liquids (see below), which separates the
polar and nonpolar moeities in a larger extent, which results in a
stronger polar–polar interplay within the liquid.

Figure 6 Relevant radial
pair correlation functions for the liquid models
investigated by classical MD simulations, describing the anion–cation
interactions for the simulation boxes at 298.15 K (for the analogous
graphs for the simulations at 420 K, please see SI).

In ILs, it is a known
phenomenon that the side chains and polar
parts of the molecules segregate into two microscopically separate
units, a polar and a nonpolar domain.37−39 This feature can highly
influence the properties of the liquid. Apart from changes in the
rheological properties, the solubility and solvation mode of the solutes
(i.e., the substrates) can be altered. This is especially important
from the point of view of the reaction because the potential microheterogeneous
structure of these liquids can aid the solvation and dissolution of
a substrate that is too lipophilic for dissolving in an ionic environment.
For the formation of nonpolar domains, the alkyl groups have to assume
a relatively straight conformation, wherein the C–C–C–C
units are (almost) all in a trans configuration. The distribution
of conformations can be easily evaluated by considering the intramolecular
distances between the terminal carbon atom of the alkyl group and
the phosphorous atom. The occurrences are plotted on Figure 7. It is observable in these
graphs that the highest occurrences correspond to a stretched-out
conformation, and therefore these side chains are not at all curled
up close to the phosphorous atom. This important finding shows that
the phosphorous atom is not blocked by the coiled side chains but
rather accessible, which is important for the substrate to react with
the forming phosphorous ylides. The stretched-out alkyl chains also
allow a significant microsegregation, as it is also shown by the strong
correlation between the terminal carbon atoms in Figure 8. The microheterogeneity apparently
increases as the side chains become longer, as one might expect from
the increasing volume of the nonpolar moieties in the system. It is
interesting to point out that the two groups of ILs tested here, namely
R4P+ and Ph3PR+, show
similar alkyl conformations and microsegregations if the side chains
are similar (see Figures 7 and 8).

distances between the phosphorous
atom and terminal carbon atom of the side chains in the investigated

Summary and Conclusions
In this
study, we aimed at designing Wittig reagent ionic liquids
(ILs), which can be used as a reagent and solvent for this synthetically
important transformation. On the basis of the earlier literature data,
we suggested that tetraalkylphosphonium and alkyl-triphenyl-phosphonium
phenolate ionic liquids might be suitable targets for this purpose.
Indeed, according to our quantum chemical calculations and in agreement
with previous indirect experimental indications,16 the formation of ylides from the ion pairs of such ionic
liquids is feasible. The forming ylides should react readily with
the carbonyl-derivative substrate of the Wittig reaction, forming
an oxaphosphetane intermediate without any significant barriers. Further
steps of the Wittig reaction were also found to be possible, as the
barriers in our calculations were almost identical to those in THF
and the ILs.

The affinity of the phosphorous to oxygen atoms
allows the formation
of a neutral substance, with a pentacoordinated phosphorous atom from
the IL ion pair. In the gas phase, these structures are dominant,
which offers several applications, for example, easier distillation
or the separation of more nucleophilic anions from phosphonium-based
ILs. In the liquid phase, however, the stability of this compound
is significantly reduced due to the ionic medium,26,27 which stabilizes the ion pair over this neutral isomer. Nevertheless,
our calculations show that in triphenylphosphonium phenolates the
formation of the P–O bond between the cation and anion occurs
to a great extent. It will be interesting to see in a follow up study
whether the change of the anion to one without an oxygen atom changes
this behavior.

The classical MD simulations show that the viscosities
of these
compounds are low at both 298.15 and 420 K, and therefore they might
be indeed used as solvents for the reaction they are also directly
involved in. The molecular level details from the MD simulations showed
significant hydrogen bonding between the basic oxygen atom of the
phenolate anion and the α-hydrogen atoms of the cation. Because
these are the hydrogen atoms that have to be removed from the cation
if the reaction is to happen, these hydrogen bonds show that the formation
of the phosphorous ylides in this solution is inherently supported
by the IL structure itself. The structure of the liquids exhibits
a significant microheterogeneity already if propyl groups are attached
to the phosphorous atom, which will be helpful for the solubility
of the substrates for the reaction.

To apply such systems in
the Wittig reaction as green processes,
it might be desirable to exchange the phenolate to other, less toxic
anions. The aforementioned reactivity is important to consider not
only for the direct application of the Wittig reagent ILs but also
if such ILs are applied in CO2 absorption from waste gases.
In the case of incomplete combustion, the partially oxidized products,
that is, aldehydes and ketones, might decompose the IL absorbent,
which is to be avoided in a sustainable process.

Models and Methods
Static
DFT and Ab Initio Calculations
Unless specified
otherwise, all static quantum chemical calculations were performed
by the ORCA44 program (version 3.0.345). The evaluation of relative Gibbs free energies
for the substrates, products, intermediates, and transition states
of the reaction requires taking into account different energetic contributions.
Thus, we combined DFT and wave function theory, statistical thermodynamics,
and a reliable solvation model. First, we conducted geometry optimization
and subsequent frequency calculations on the considered structures
at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPP(Grid 5) level of theory.46−48 The nature of the stationary point was evaluated by verifying the
eigenvalues of the Hessian. Second, single point calculations were
performed on the obtained geometries to obtain reliable electronic
energies. For this purpose, we applied DLPNO-CCSD(T),49 which provides the energies within an error of 1 kJ mol–1.50 The energy calculations
were performed at the DLPNO-CCSD(T) level of theory with def2-TZVPP
and def2-QZVPP basis sets. An additional basis set for correlational
fitting was included in each case. We specified normal settings for
the DLPNO calculations (TCutPairs 1 × 10-4,
TCutPNO 3.33 × 10-7, TCutMKN 1 × 10-3).

The extrapolation of the calculated energies
to the complete basis set51 was undertaken
separately for Hartree–Fock and DLPNO-CCSD(T) correlation energy
as follows 1   2   3  Third, we calculated the zero-point vibrational
energies and thermal corrections from statistical thermodynamics calculations
in the ideal gas state for finite temperatures at 298.15 and 420 K
from the DFT geometries and frequencies according to the approach
described in ref (52). The combination of the electronic energies and the thermal corrections
to the finite temperature provides the Gibbs free energy in the gas
phase. Finally, the Gibbs free solvation energies at infinite dilution
were calculated from the COSMO-RS.53,54 The ionic
liquid solvent was modeled by a 1:1 mixture of the corresponding cation
and anion. The sum of the gas phase and solvation Gibbs free energies
provides a good estimate for the reaction and activation Gibbs free
energies in the solvents.

Classical MD Simulations
For all
classical simulations,
the optimized potential for liquid simulations (OPLS) potential form55 was applied. For the PR4+ cations, the force field parameters were taken from the OPLS-based
CL&P force field fitted for the structures by Pádua and
Canongia Lopes.56 The Lennard-Jones parameters
for the Ph3PR+ cations were taken from the OPLS
force field.55 The charges for the latter
cations were obtained by first performing RESP fitting at the TPSS-D3/def-TZVPP
level on the structures that were optimized at the same level by the
CP2K program,57 then consistently with
the approach of Pádua and Canongia Lopes for ionic liquids,
a systematic set of charges was obtained that allows substitution
by the OPLS functional groups. The obtained charges can be found in
the SI. Because the force constants generally
do not influence the structure of the liquid in a significant manner,
all CA–P, CA–P–CA, and CA–P–CT
force constants were taken from the CT–P, CT–P–CT,
and CT–P–CT data,56 respectively
(CA: carbon atom in the phenyl ring, CT: an sp3 carbon
atom). The Vm,ijkl Fourier constants of the dihedrals describing the rotation
of the phenyl groups on the phosphorous atom around the CA–P
bonds were all set to 0.0, which is as usual for molecules with such
steric demand, assuming that the repulsive van der Waals forces will
control these rotations. The reference bond lengths and angles that
include the phosphorous were taken from the TPSS-D3/def-TZVPP optimized
geometry of Ph3PEt+, whereas for the rest the
OPLS/AMBER parameters were taken.55,58 The bonding
parameters for the phenolate anion were taken from the OPLS/AMBER
force fields,55,58 whereas the charges were taken
from the RESP fitting at the TPSS-D3/def-TZVPP level on the structure
that was previously optimized at the same level by CP2K.57

The classical MD simulations were performed
using the LAMMPS program package,59,60 with periodic
boundary conditions. The simulation boxes for classical MD simulations
contained 250–360 ion pairs of the IL (see Table 7). The initial boxes were prepared
to represent a densitiy of ca. 0.6–0.8 g cm–3 using the packmol program.61 After 0.5
ns of initial equilibration at the simulation temperature in an NVT
ensemble, 1 ns NpT simulation was run (T = 298.15
or 420 K; p = 1 bar). Over the last 0.5 ns the box
volume was averaged, and the average volume was taken for the subsequent
simulations. The obtained cell vectors and densities are shown in Table 7. After 1 ns equilibration,
a 10 ns production run was performed for both temperatures in the
NVT ensemble (T = 298.15 or 420 K). The temperature
and pressure were controlled by Nosé–Hoover chain thermostats
and barostats,62−64 respectively. The time step was chosen to be 0.5
fs. The trajectory was saved in every picosecond. Viscosities were
obtained by applying the Green–Kubo formula from the ensemble
average of the stress tensor’s autocorrelation. All AIMD and
classical MD trajectories were analyzed using the TRAVIS program.65

AIMD Simulations
The cubic simulation box, containing
32 Et3BuP+PhO– ion pairs,
was created by a short classical MD simulation (see Figure 9). The box length was calculated
to be 27.234 Å so that it represents a realistic density for
a phosphonium-derivative IL.

phenolate, Et3BuP+PhO– (cations are shown in blue, phenolate anion in red). Right: Ball-and-stick
representation of the ions of the simulated IL (on the right, red:
oxygen, orange: carbon, white: hydrogen, and yellow: phosphorus).

All AIMD simulations were carried
out with the CP2K57 program package using
the QUICKSTEP module,66 using hybrid Gaussian
and plane wave basis sets.

For AIMD simulations, we utilized
the BLYP functional67,68 and an empirical dispersion correction,
with Becke–Johnson
damping.47,48 For all atoms, the molecularly optimized
double-ζ basis set (MOLOPT-DZVP-SR-GTH),69 with corresponding Goedecker–Teter–Hutter
pseudopotentials for core electrons,70−72 was applied. A 280 Ry
density cutoff criterion, with the finest grid level, was employed
together with multigrid number 5 (NGRID 5 and REL_CUTOFF 40), using
the smoothing for the electron density (NN10_SMOOTH) and its derivative
(NN10).66 For the energy calculations,
the convergence criterion of 1.0E-5 was used.

The simulation
teperature was regulated using Nosé–Hoover
chain thermostats.62−64 A time step of 0.5 fs was chosen. The simulation
boxes were equilibrated for 2.5 ps at a temperature of 450 K at a
constant volume with a massive thermostat, with a time constant of
10 fs. The system was then simulated in a canonical ensemble for 81.5
ps at a temperature of 350 K, with a time constant of 100 fs.
