Thymidylate kinases
are essential enzymes with roles in DNA synthesis
and repair and have been the target of drug development for antimalarials,
antifungals, HIV treatment, and cancer therapeutics. Human thymidylate
kinase (hTMPK) conversion of the anti-HIV prodrug 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine
(AZT or zidovudine) monophosphate to diphosphate is the rate-limiting
step in the activation of AZT. A point mutant (F105Y) has been previously
reported with significantly increased activity for the monophosphate
form of the drug [3′-azidothymidine-5′-monophosphate
(AZTMP)]. Using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques,
we show that while the wild-type (WT) and F105Y hTMPK adopt the same
structure in solution, significant changes in dynamics may explain
their different activities toward TMP and AZTMP. 13C spin-relaxation
measurements show that there is little change in dynamics on the ps
to ns time scale. In contrast, methyl 1H relaxation dispersion
shows that AZTMP alters adenosine nucleotide handling in the WT protein
but not in the mutant. Additionally, the F105Y mutant has reduced
conformational flexibility, leading to an increase in affinity for
the product ADP and a slower rate of phosphorylation of TMP. The dynamics
at the catalytic center for F105Y bound to AZTMP are tuned to the
same frequency as WT bound to TMP, which may explain the mutant’s
catalytic efficiency toward the prodrug.

Introduction
Thymidylate kinases
(TMPKs, EC 2.7.4.9) catalyze the simple, yet
essential phosphorylation of TMP to form TDP using Mg2+ and ATP.1 While other deoxyribonucleotides can be produced from their counterpart
ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase, thymidine deoxyribonucleotides
are formed exclusively by serial phosphorylation of TMP from one of
two starting points: phosphorylation of thymidine by thymidine kinase
using the salvage pathway or conversion of dUMP to TMP by thymidylate
synthase in the de novo pathway.1,2 TMPK sits at the intersection
of these two pathways, serving as the only means of TDP production
and thus regulates the pool of available TTP for use in DNA synthesis
and repair.3−5 Human and viral TMPKs are required for the activation
of a number of antiviral drugs.6

All reported TMPKs are homodimers with an overall molecular weight
of approximately 50 kDa and are composed of four functionally important
regions: the ATP α- and β-phosphate binding loop (P-loop),
the adenosine ring binding loop (A-loop), a domain that forms a lid
over the active site (LID), and a nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) binding
site (Figure 1).7−14 The P-loop (residues 13–20, human numbering), A-loop (residues
179–184), and LID (residues 134–153) are all involved
in binding and orientation of the bound ATP. Type I TMPKs, which are
typically found in eukaryotes, contain two important Arg residues
(45, 97) that interact with the phosphate groups on the substrates.
Type II TMPKs, which are typically found in prokaryotes, possess both
of these Arg residues, as well as an additional Arg in the LID.7

Figure 1 Important structural features of hTMPK. Locations of the
P-loop
(cyan), A-loop (yellow), and LID (red) are indicated on one monomer.
These elements move concomitantly toward α7 of the NMP-binding
site (labeled) during the catalytic cycle. ADP and TMP shown in yellow,
rendered as sticks (PDB 1e2d).

Most nucleoside monophosphate
kinases are assumed to work by a
mechanism that is similar to the extensively characterized monomeric
AMP kinase (AMPK), though they lack some of the same structural features.
AMPK have a variable length loop (ATPlid) that closes over the bound
ATP in the near-transition state complex formed with Ap5A. The binding site for the AMP substrate (AMPbd) also becomes more
compact in this complex.15 The transition
of the ATPlid occurs by unfolding of the ATPlid, followed by refolding
in the Ap5A complex.16

Unlike AMPKs, TMPKs contain a much shorter,
unstructured LID region
that is similar to that of uridylate kinase, and they do not appear
to undergo as extensive conformational changes associated with binding
of ATP and the nucleoside monophosphate. Crystallographic structures
of the type I human thymidylate kinase (hTMPK) taken along the reaction
coordinate suggest movement of the P-loop, A-loop, and LID from the
so-called “P-loop open” or “P-loop partially-closed”
conformation (obtained with an ATP analogue and TMP) to the active “P-loop
closed” conformation (obtained with a transition state analogue
Ap5dT) is required for catalysis.9 Significant structural changes during the catalytic cycle include
a 2 Å shift of the mainchain atoms of the P-loop toward the bound
TMP and the side chain of Asp15, which swings toward the 3′OH
of the bound TMP from an initial distance of 6.8 Å (3′OH
to Oδ1) in the TMP ADP complex to 3.7 Å in the Ap5dT complex. These changes are driven by hydrogen bonds between Asp15
on the P-loop and the side chains of Gln157 on α7 and Arg97
in the nucleoside monophosphate binding site. These interactions are
important for catalytic proficiency because mutation of Asp15 to Ala,
Asn, or Glu results in an inactive enzyme.9,17 The
shorter LID sequence in eukaryotic type I TMPKs does not contain the
arginine that directly interacts with the phosphates of ATP as found
in type II TMPKs.8,18 This suggests that the coordinated
motions of the P-loop, A-loop, and LID that are unique to type I TMPKs
compensate for the reduction in size and lack of a phosphate interacting
partner in the shortened LID.

There is considerable interest
in the structure and dynamics of
hTMPK from a therapeutic perspective. hTMPK has shown promise as a
potential anticancer target as its inhibition in LKB1-mutant lung
cancer cells is lethal.19 Combined inhibition
of hTMPK and treatment with doxorubicin impairs DNA repair and reduced
tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.20,21 In addition to its potential role in cancer treatment, hTMPK catalyzes
the rate-limiting step for the activation of antiretroviral thymidine
analogue prodrug 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT or
zidovudine). The 70-fold slower conversion of 3′-azidothymidine-5′-monophosphate
(AZTMP) by the human enzyme results in a buildup of the toxic monophosphate
form of AZT (see Table 1).22−25

X-ray-derived structures of the wild-type
(WT) enzyme in complex
with ADP and TMP or AZTMP show very few differences. Differences between
the TMP and AZTMP complexes are seen for the catalytically important
partially closed state that occurs when TMP and AppNHp are bound in
the active site. In the case of TMP, the P-loop is drawn closer to
the NMP-binding site because of the formation of a hydrogen bond between
Asp15HN and Gln157Oε1. This hydrogen bond does not
occur in the WT complex with AZTMP and AppNHp.9,26 Thus,
the low activity toward AZTMP has been attributed to the presence
of the bulky azido group that blocks the approach of the P-loop to
TMP during catalysis. This hypothesis was supported by structures
of hTMPK in the complex with a bisubstrate inhibitor, where the distance
between the Asp15Cγ and C3′ on Ap5dT is 4.2
Å, while this distance is 6.7 Å in the Ap5AZT
complex. Structures of hTMPK with various TMP-analogue prodrugs have
shown that the presence of a hydrogen bond donor at the 3′
position of TMP also helps to stabilize the closed conformation.27

The TMPK from yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, ScTMPK), a type I TMPK, also shows low
activity toward AZTMP, with
a kCAT of 0.175 s–,1 which is 200-fold lower than the activity toward dTMP (35
s–1).8 In contrast to
type I TMPKs, the type II TMPK from Escherichia coli shows a kCAT of 6 s–1 toward AZTMP, which is only 40% lower than the kCAT toward dTMP (15 s–1).28 The crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme in the presence of AZTMP indicates
that the type II TMPK can accommodate the 3′ azido group without
significant distortion of the active site29 because of an alternate interaction with the bound TMP that involves
Glu12 on the P-loop instead of Asp15. The enhanced activity of the E. coli enzyme toward AZTMP led Brundiers et al.
to develop a number of yeast-E. coli chimeric TMPKs that showed enhanced activity toward AZTMP.17 Changes that enhanced the activity of the yeast
enzyme were also applied to the human enzyme, resulting in a similar
increase in activity toward AZTMP. To further increase the activity
of the chimeric hTMPK enzymes, Brundiers also altered residue 105
in hTMPK from Phe to Tyr, based on the fact that a Tyr is found at
this position in the yeast enzyme and most other TMPKs. Remarkably,
they discovered that the Phe105Tyr mutation alone conferred a 20-fold
increase in activity toward AZTMP, while only reducing activity toward
the natural substrate (TMP) 4-fold (see Table 1).17 The preferential
activity of F105Y toward AZTMP has been exploited as a suicide enzyme
for gene therapy cancer treatments.30

X-ray crystallography studies have provided considerable detail
regarding potential conformational changes during catalysis as well
as information on the interaction of both the WT enzyme and the F105Y
mutant with AZTMP. Crystallographic structures of F105Y hTMPK in complex
with either TMP or AZTMP have shown that the mutation shifts the P-loop
to a position that is similar to that found in the complex between
Ap5dT and the WT enzyme. This shift is due, in part, to
a new hydrogen bond between Tyr105OH and Asp15HN in the
P-loop. It is inferred from these structures that the additional hydrogen
bond between Tyr105OH and Asp15HN compensates for the steric
clash of the sidechain of Asp15 and 3′N3 of AZTMP,
and it has been suggested that this shift in the P-loop is the structural
basis for the higher activity toward AZTMP.26 However, the approach of the sidechain of Asp15 to the TMP 3′OH
would still be blocked by the azido group when AZTMP is used as the
substrate. Unfortunately, the structure of the F105Y protein complexed
with either AZTMP and AppNHp, or Ap5AZT, has not been reported;
thus, it is not possible to determine what potential changes might
occur in the structure as the AZTMP ATP complex approaches the transition
state. Consequently, it is still not clear why the F105Y mutant is
so proficient at phosphorylating AZTMP. Clearly, the dynamics of these
important loops play a critical role in transitioning to the catalytically
active “P-loop closed” state.

Here, we employ
spin-relaxation and methyl relaxation dispersion
(RD) experiments to better understand the dynamical implications of
the 3′-azido group of AZTMP and putative stabilizing effects
of the F105Y mutant over multiple time scales. Similar RD studies
on AMPK confirmed previous biochemical work32−35 and showed that the rate limiting
step (product release) was due to opening of the lid.32 Remarkably, the catalytic rate of AMPK can be tuned by
mutations33,36 or solvent conditions33 that affected loop dynamics.

We show that AZTMP affects
ADP binding in the WT enzyme, leading
to destabilization of the closed conformation for the LID and the
P-loop. In addition, we show that the μs to ms dynamics near
critical active site residues are highly perturbed in WT hTMPK when
bound to AZTMP, while in the F105Y mutant–AZTMP complex, this
region is stabilized and has similar properties as the WT–TMP
complex, explaining the ability of F105Y hTMPK to effectively phosphorylate
AZTMP by the appropriate tuning of the protein dynamics.

Results
WT and F105Y
hTMPK Have the Same Average Solution Structure
The 1H–13C HMQC spectra of WT and
F105Y hTMPK bound to either TMP and ADP (Figure 2) or AZTMP and ADP (Figure S4) show few chemical shift perturbations (CSPs), as anticipated
from the similarities in the crystal structures of the four complexes.
Although Val14 in the P-loop adopts different positions in the crystal
structures, it has the same shift in all complexes, suggesting the
same average solution structure. Leu57δ1/δ2, Leu161δ1,
and Leu167δ1 show the largest but still modest, CSPs. These
residues are proximal to the NMP-binding site and likely reflect local
minor structural changes required to accommodate the Phe →
Tyr mutation (Figure 2, inset). Moreover, 1H–13C HMQC spectra
of WT and F105Y hTMPK bound to the bisubstrate inhibitor Ap5dT are essentially identical to their TMP ADP counterparts (Figure S4). The largest CSP between the Ap5dT complex and the TMP or AZTMP complexes is seen for I184δ1
(0.05 ppm 1H). The lack of significant CSPs in the spectra
of the different protein–ligand combinations suggests they
all adopt the same average structure in solution.

Figure 2 Overlay of WT and F105Y
hTMPK bound to TMP and ADP 1H–13C HMQC
spectra. WT (black) and F105Y (red)
spectra have few CSPs (cyan arrows). The inset shows the location
of residues with large (red spheres) and small CSPs (pink spheres)
in the structure. Largest CSP was associated with L161R (1H CSP = 0.035 ppm and 13C CSP = 0.08 ppm). Stereochemistry
indicated by R and S; R indicates γ1 (Val) or δ1 (Leu),
and S indicates γ2 (Val) or δ2 (Leu).

These spectra clearly indicate that there are changes in the dynamics
of the enzyme because of replacement of Phe105 with Tyr. Notably, Figure 2 shows that Ile49δ1
is exchange broadened in WT spectra but appears in F105Y spectra.
This is quite remarkable because Ile49 is located at the interface
between the two subunits and is 16 Å removed from the site of
the mutation, suggesting that stabilization of the protein by the
F105Y mutation alters the intersubunit dynamics. Similar effects are
seen with the bisubstrate inhibitor Ap5dT, where the resonances
from Ile49 and Ile184 are broader in the WT spectrum (Figure S4). The chemical shift of Ile184 is altered
by 0.05 ppm in the Ap5dT spectra, suggesting that the position
of the adenine ring in the TMP ADP complex is slightly different than
in the Ap5dT complex; equivalent shifts would be predicted
from the crystallographic structures.

F105Y hTMPK Has Altered
ADP Binding Affinity and Kinetics
To ensure that the WT and
F105Y complexes were saturated with ADP
for the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) measurements,
we directly measured the binding constants for ADP in the presence
of either TMP or AZTMP. This was achieved by two-dimensional lineshape
fitting of resonance lines with CSPs from a series of 1H–13C HMQC spectra with increasing concentrations
of ADP titrated into WT or F105Y hTMPK bound to either TMP or AZTMP
(Table 2). The KD is not dependent on the identity of the ligand
in the NMP site; however, F105Y hTMPK has a 2.5-fold higher affinity
for ADP than WT. Interestingly, the koff is ligand dependent for both proteins, with AZTMP showing a 2-fold
faster off-rate with the WT protein and a 15-fold reduced off-rate
in the case of F105Y–AZTMP. The faster off-rate of AZTMP from
the WT enzyme may reflect the unfavorable interaction between the
3′-azido group and Asp15 on the P-loop.26 The off-rate of AZTMP from F105Y is similar to the catalytic
rate (0.25 s–1, Table 1), suggesting that product release may be
rate-limiting.

Ile184 Is a Sensitive Probe
of ADP Saturation and Dynamics
Ile184δ1 undergoes a
dramatic 1H CSP of 0.72 ppm
upon addition of ADP to hTMPK bound to either TMP or AZTMP (see Figure 3A). This can be attributed
to the ring current shift experienced by Ile184,38 which is in close proximity to the aromatic adenine ring
of ADP (Figure 3B).
RD measurements for WT hTMPK with bound AZTMP at two concentrations
of ADP illustrate the high sensitivity of RD to identify sparsely
populated states. Because of the large Δω between the
ADP-bound and ADP-free states, Rex (=papbΔω2/kex) shows a marked increase
as the population of the free state, pb, increases at the lower ADP concentration. The two Ile184δ1
dispersion curves (Figure 3C) for ADP concentrations of 2 and 8 mM result in fitted exchange
parameters describing two different processes (Table 3).

Figure 3 Ile184δ1 is sensitive to adenosine nucleotide
saturation.
(A) Overlay of spectra of WT hTMPK bound to TMP (black) and TMP and

a Fit to
the full model, eq S2. Fitted parameters
for F105Y are omitted
here because there is essentially no exchange in either the TMP or
AZTMP complex, regardless of the concentration of ADP. This is due
to the smaller KD for the binding of ADP
to the F105Y protein, leading to full saturation.

Because Ile184δ1 is in slow
exchange in the WT–AZTMP
2 mM ADP complex, its dispersion curve could be reliably fit to separate pa and Δω, allowing for a comparison
to the observed CSP for ADP binding and the binding parameters obtained
from the ADP titration. The fitted Ile184δ1 Δω of
0.62 ± 0.02 ppm with 2 mM ADP bound (Table 3) is consistent with the observed CSP of
0.72 ppm, while the Δω of 0.35 ± 0.05 ppm with 8
mM ADP when fit to the full model (not shown) is not consistent. Likewise,
the pa of 98.6 ± 0.08% for the WT–AZTMP
2 mM ADP complex is in close agreement with the theoretical fractional
saturation of 98.8% (see Supporting Information). Additionally, pa and kex allow for an estimate of 17 ± 4.0 μM for KD and 31 ± 5.1 s–1 for koff (see Supporting Information), which are consistent with the KD of
15 ± 1 μM and koff of 24 ±
0.8 s–1, respectively, that were obtained directly
from the ADP titration experiment.

AZTMP and the F105Y Mutant
Alter the Dynamics of the ATP-Binding
Site
We were able to probe dynamics at the adenine ring with
Ile184 and dynamics near the phosphate groups of ADP with Val14, Leu137,
and Leu161. In order to capture relevant motions contributing to ligand-induced
conformational change of the P-loop, LID, and A-loop on the μs
to ms timescale, it is critical to ensure that contributions to Rex from ligand exchange with the free pool is
effectively zero. For the following, we limit our discussion to complexes
with 8 mM ADP to ensure saturating conditions of ADP and dispersion
measurements, which report on internal dynamics of the protein and
not simply ADP exchange.

RD of Ile184 shows that the adenine
ring is effectively static on the μs to ms timescale in the
F105Y complex with either TMP or AZTMP bound. At an ADP concentration
of 2 mM (not shown) or 8 mM (Figure 4A), both F105Y–TMP and F105Y–AZTMP showed
a Rex ≈ 0 and could not be reliably
fit to an exchange model, suggesting that there is no exchange process
for Ile184δ1 in F105Y. In contrast, both WT complexes undergo
a fast exchange process, even when saturated with ADP. This process
is approximately 3-fold faster in WT–AZTMP with a 20-fold increase
in φex (Table 3), indicating significant motion of the adenine ring in the
WT–AZTMP complex. This change is likely due to changes in both pb and Δω to account for the large
increase in φex.

Solid lines represent a best fit to the fast exchange model (eq 1) for all residues except
F105Y Ile184δ1 which were fit to a “no exchange”
model, i.e., a straight line at R20. R20 is subtracted
from the data, normalizing the curve to 0 to facilitate comparisons.
WT-AZTMP ADP shows increases to Rex across
all of these residues, but F105Y-AZTMP does not.

Val14, Leu137, and Leu161 are in close contact in the closed form
of the enzyme, bringing together the P-loop, LID, and α7 in
the NMP binding site. These three methyl groups serve as ideal probes
to monitor changes to these regions involved in the shift from the
“P-loop open” to the active “P-loop closed”
conformations. The dispersion curves show (i) WT–AZTMP has
increased Rex compared to WT–TMP,
(ii) F105Y–AZTMP has a slightly reduced Rex, and (iii) F105Y–TMP has a similar or lower Rex than F105Y–AZTMP. The fitted parameters,
summarized in Table 4 (upper section), show a general trend in that the exchange rates
for WT–TMP and WT–AZTMP are equivalent or higher than
F105Y, and φex is larger for the WT protein.

values for Ro and the reduced χ2 for each of these
methyl groups can be found in Supporting Information Tables S1–S3 for Val10, Val14, and Val95, and Tables S4–S6
for Leu137, Leu161, and Leu167.

The dynamics of the P-loop, as reported by Val14γ1, are related
to the catalytic efficiency of each complex. The kex in the WT–TMP–ADP complex is largest
with the F105Y complexes being almost halved (Figure 4B). Notably, both F105Y complexes were fit
to nearly the same exchange rate. The least efficient complex, WT–AZTMP,
shows a lower exchange rate and a higher value of φex, suggesting a higher occupancy of an unproductive state. The φex values for WT–TMP and WT–AZTMP are approximately
double of those seen for the F105Y, indicating that the F105Y mutation
likely reduces the population of the minor state (Table 4).

Dynamics of the LID
region is probed by Leu137, which is contained
in the α6. The 2-fold increase in φex for Leu137δ1
in the WT–AZTMP complex versus the WT–TMP complex suggest
some destabilization of the LID in WT–AZTMP (Table 4, upper section). Also, the kex for F105Y–TMP is notably higher than
the other complexes pointing toward a more rapid interconversion between
the major and minor conformers. The exchange rate of F105Y–AZTMP
is similar to that of WT–TMP.

The dynamics of the helix
that follows the disordered portion of
the LID (α7), as reported by Leu161δ1, show a similar
trend as Leu137δ1, in that, the exchange rate of the F105Y–TMP
complex is higher than the other three complexes (Table 4, upper section). The reduced kex for WT–AZTMP may reflect the unfavorable
transition to the closed conformation. Also, the φex is distinct between the mutant and WT protein with a slight increase
for the F105Y–TMP complex.

Leu167δ1, positioned
at the C-terminal end of α7, is
fit to a similar kex for all four complexes.
WT–AZTMP has a 2-fold increase in φex compared
to WT–TMP. The φex for both F105Y–TMP
and F105Y–AZTMP is more similar to WT–TMP, meaning this
dynamical perturbation is unique to WT–AZTMP (Table 4, middle).

WT–AZTMP
has Altered Dynamics Near the Catalytic Center
Exchange properties
for Val10γ2 and Val95γ2 reveal
another region of the protein affected by the ligand bound in the
NMP site and the F105Y mutation, the interior β-sheet. Val10
and Val95 are situated on adjacent β-strands (β1 and β3,
respectively) at the interface between the P-loop and the catalytically
important DRX motif (Figure 5E).9,14 In contrast to the residues near
the ATP-binding site, this pair shows a reduced Rex for WT–AZTMP, increased Rex for WT–TMP, and an intermediate Rex for both F105Y complexes (Figure 5A). The WT–TMP, F105Y–TMP,
and F105Y–AZTMP complexes all show essentially the same kex of ∼550 s–1 for
both residues. In contrast, the WT–AZTMP complex has an increased kex for both residues.

of WT hTMPK are perturbed by AZTMP. Panels
(A–D) show 850 MHz dispersion curves for WT complexes with
TMP ADP (circles) and AZTMP ADP (triangles) (panels A,C). F105Y complexes
with TMP ADP (circles) and AZTMP ADP (triangles) (panels B,D). Data
from Val10γ2 is given in panels (A,B) and data from Val95γ2
is given in panels (C,D). R20 is subtracted from the data, normalizing
the curve to 0 to facilitate comparisons. F105Y–AZTMP and WT–TMP
curves and parameters the most similar, possibly explaining why both
have higher catalytic rates. Panel (E) shows that Val10γ2 and
Val95γ2 are directly beneath the catalytically important DRY
(teal sticks) motif.

Interestingly, for Val95γ2,
WT–TMP and F105Y–AZTMP
have nearly identical exchange parameters, while for both WT–AZTMP
and F105Y–TMP, the substrates with reduced catalytic rate,
show larger and smaller values for kex, respectively (Table 4, lower section). The exchange rates for Val10γ2 have a similar
trend to Val95γ2 (Table 4, lower section).

Ap5dT Bound to WT hTMPK Shows
a Dynamic Intermediate
Crystallographic structures have shown
that the bisubstrate inhibitor
Ap5dT induces the fully closed conformation in WT hTMPK.9 Our RD experiments show that WT hTMPK shows enhanced
exchange in the presence of Ap5dT for residues in the LID
region (Leu137δ1), A-loop (Ile184δ1), and the NMP-binding
site (Leu161δ1, Leu167δ1) (see Figure S6), suggesting intrinsic motions in these regions may be important
for formation of the transition state. The increase in exchange for
these residues is attenuated in the F105Y–Ap5dT
complex (Figure S6). A comparison of the
exchange for WT–Ap5dT and F105Y–Ap5dT (Figure 6) shows
that in all cases, the exchange for F105Y is reduced compared to the
WT complex, and the differences between the two proteins is largest
for residues in the P-loop (Val14), LID (Leu137), A-loop (Ile184),
and the NMP-binding site (Leu161 and Leu167). For most residues, with
the exception of Leu161, the kex was similar
in both proteins and the WT–Ap5dT complex showed
higher values of φex (Table S7).

Figure 6 Ap5dT increases dynamics of WT enzyme for residues near
the ATP-binding site. Dispersion curves acquired at 850 MHz are shown
for the WT complexes with Ap5dT (brown squares) and the
F105Y complex with Ap5dT (yellow open squares) for Val10γ2
(panel A), Val14γ1 (panel B), Val95γ2 (panel C), Leu137δ1
(panel D), Leu161δ1 (panel E), Leu167δ1 (panel F), and
Ile184δ1 (panel G). R20 is subtracted from the data, normalizing
the curve to 0 to facilitate comparisons. Note: the maximum of the y-axis is 50 s–1 for Ile184. Solid lines
represent a best fit to the fast exchange model (eq 1) for all residues. A reduced population of
the minor state in the F105Y complex reduces the Rex. Dynamical differences in the approach of F105Y hTMPK
into the transition state may contribute to enzyme’s reduced
activity with TMP.

WT and F105Y hTMPK Have
Similar ps to ns Dynamics
The
ps to ns dynamics of WT and F105Y hTMPK bound to ADP and either TMP
or AZTMP were measured using 13C R1 and R1ρ relaxation experiments.
The S2 values obtained from analysis of
the R1 and R2 rates are largely similar for each of the four complexes (Figures 7 and S7). The nature of the bound ligand, TMP or AZTMP,
does not affect the order parameters (Figure S7). This was expected as the R20 values fit from the RD experiments
do not differ greatly between the four complexes (Tables S1–S6). The color mapping shown in Figure 7 illustrates the
general summary that residues in the β-sheet below the active
site are relatively rigid as is the P-loop near the terminal phosphate
on ADP. The helix that is amino-terminal to the LID is mobile on the
ps to ns time scale (S2 = 0.23 for Leu137).
Unfortunately, there are no Ile, Leu, and Val (ILV) residues on the
unstructured portion of the LID, preventing characterization of its
motion.

Figure 7 F105Y induced changes to ps to ns dynamics at the dimer interface.
Panel (A) shows mapping of S2 order parameters
onto the X-ray structure using a blue-to-red color map. Blue represents
high order parameters, and red presents low order parameters. Val80γ2
(labeled, rendered in sticks and highlighted) shows an increased S2 for the F105Y mutant. Panel (B) shows a correlation
plot of order parameters for WT and F105Y bound to AZTMP, and ADP
shows significant differences in S2 for
only Val80γ2.

Although the order parameters
are similar between WT and F105Y,
Val80γ2 has a higher S2 of 0.76
± 0.01 in the F105Y–AZTMP complex as compared to 0.70
± 0.03 in the WT–AZTMP complex (Figure 7). The enhanced ordering of Val80 is also
seen in the TMP complex (see S8, panel
C). This residue is at the dimer interface, and its restricted dynamics
in the F105Y enzyme parallels our observations from Ile49, which also
becomes less dynamic in the F105Y enzyme (see Figure 1). Changes in the dynamics of the protein
due to replacement of Phe105 with Tyr are propagated to the dimer
interface.

Discussion
Among TMPKs, hTMPK is
a particularly slow enzyme with turnover
rates nearly an order of magnitude below other eukaryotic counterparts,13 and it shows even poorer activity against AZTMP.
The low activity toward AZTMP may be due to the presence of a Phe
at position 105 because many microbial TMPKs that are adept at AZTMP
phosphorylation have a tyrosine at position 105 (human numbering),
which presumably performs the same function as stabilizing P-loop
closure in F105Y hTMPK. However, the existence of a Tyr residue at
position 105 does not automatically result in high activity toward
AZTMP. While most TMPKs have a Tyr at this position, the ratio of kCATAZTMP/kCATTMP is quite variable among different TMPKs. For example, the
TMPKs from E. coli and Yersinia pestis both containing a Tyr residue at
108 (E. coli numbering), show 71% sequence
identity, yet show a ratio of kCATAZTMP/kCATTMP of 0.16 versus
0.01, respectively.39 Consequently, the
ability of the single change of F105Y to greatly enhance the activity
of hTMPK toward AZTMP appears to be unique and not solely due to the
additional OH group that is added when Phe105 is altered to Tyr.

Dynamical
Not Structural Perturbations Explain Differences in
AZTMP Phosphorylation
ScTMPK which has been cocrystallized
with TMP alone shows the highly conserved Asp15 on the P-loop contacts
Arg97 and the 3′OH of TMP, forming the so-called “P-loop
closed” conformation and suggesting that even in the absence
of ATP, the enzyme exchanges between the open and closed states. Cocrystallization
of the yeast enzyme with Ap5dT induces shifts similar to
those seen in hTMPK bound to Ap5dT with movements in the
A-loop and ordering of the LID, which is disordered in the TMP-bound
structure. Thus, the biasing toward P-loop closure by F105Y hTMPK
may be an artifact observable only at cryogenic temperatures in the
crystalline lattice. Indeed, our higher temperature nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra contain few CSPs in the P-loop, A-loop, and
LID, suggesting no difference in the average solution structure. Similarly,
the dynamics of these complexes show no major differences on the ps
to ns time scale, suggesting slower processes such as larger domain
motions may be responsible for catalytic differences.

Differences
on the μs to ms time scale due to transition between the open
and closed conformation were revealed by methyl RD experiments as
dynamical perturbations to the residues on the P-loop (Val14), LID
(Leu137), and α7 near the active site (Leu161). Our overall
framework for analysis is that the excited state is the closed form
of the enzyme. In the case of the WT enzyme complexed with AZTMP,
the dynamic properties of this structure is not conducive to phosphate
transfer, while in the case of the F105Y enzyme, the dynamics are
tuned in such a way that the enzyme can facilitate phosphate transfer
in a similar fashion to the tuning of AMPK activity by changes in
the dynamics of structural elements in that protein.33,36

The dynamics of Val14γ1 partially explains previous
crystallographic
and kinetic data. Because the φex values are similar
for both WT–TMP and WT–AZTMP (8600 vs 10,000), it is
reasonable to assume the same motion is captured in both complexes.
The exchange rate is halved for WT–AZTMP, dropping from 1200
to 590 s–1, indicating that AZTMP blocks
the approach of the P-loop toward the NMP-site, the “P-loop
closed” excited state. Both F105Y–TMP and F105Y–AZTMP
have nearly identical exchange rates of 730 and 740 s–1, both of which are faster than WT–AZTMP. This is taken to
show that the F105Y mutation allows the enzyme to access a closed
form regardless of the substrate in the NMP site. The modest decrease
in φex and kex in the
F105Y complexes reflects the reduced population and exchange to the
closed state, which may explain the overall reduced activity of the
mutant.

Leu137δ1 and Leu161δ1 report on helical
movements near
the active site and show distinct dynamics, which are both ligand
and protein dependent. We suggest that these residues, situated at
the interface of the ATP- and NMP-binding sites, are sensitive to
P-loop closure. The exchange rate for WT–AZTMP is reduced relative
to WT–TMP, while the rate for F105Y–TMP is somewhat
faster. Interestingly, the exchange rates for WT–TMP and F105Y–AZTMP
are similar, suggesting a requirement for a particular frequency for
efficient catalysis.

The exchange parameters for Val95γ2,
a residue adjacent to
the critical DRX motif (residues 96–98), are also indicative
of dynamical perturbations related to the catalytic rate. The WT–AZTMP
complex has a 1.5-fold increased kex value
for both Val10γ2 and Val95γ2, while the more catalytically
competent complexes have kex more similar
to WT–TMP, including Ap5dT, which should closely
approximate the transition state.9,40 We take this
to suggest that AZTMP has a deleterious effect on the dynamics of
Arg97 in the DRX motif, possibly by preventing the 2.1 Å swing
of Asp15 into the NMP-binding site. The increased exchange rates may
represent Arg97 moving unproductively in the WT–AZTMP complex,
while in the other complexes, it is partially held in place by the
availability of surrounding interacting partners. The F105Y complexes
appear to be more rigid in the ATP-binding site, allowing Asp15 to
interact with Arg97, stabilizing the active site by assuming the excited
closed state.

The appearance of Ile49δ1 in the Ap5dT 1H–13C HMQC spectra may report
on the dynamics of
the NMP-site in the catalytically productive state. Ile49 resides
at the dimer interface proximal to Arg45, which interacts with the
α-phosphate of the TMP, possibly reporting on intersubunit communication
between the adjacent NMP-sites or an active conformation for Arg45
(Figure 8). Likewise,
appearance of this resonance in the spectra of F105Y may indicate
the stabilization of this same state. It has been shown using a chemical
biology approach that the rotation of the α-phosphate away from
Arg97 and toward Arg45 is required for efficient catalysis of ribose-modified
TMP nucleotides.27 The effect of the transition
state complex Ap5dT on the dynamics of the WT enzyme shows
increased exchange for Leu137δ1 and Leu161δ1 when compared
to the TMP complex (Figure S6). In contrast,
these two residues show similar exchange rates for the F105Y mutant,
suggesting that the stabilizing effect of Tyr105 extends to Ile49
via Arg45.

Figure 8 Reduction in exchange of Ile49 in F105Y is due to the stabilization
of Arg45 in the closed complex. Guanidino group of Arg45 interacts
with the α-phosphate of dTMP and Glu149 in the LID. This interaction
also stabilizes Leu 137δ1 (not shown) and Leu161δ.

If P-loop closure alone was the rate-limiting step
in catalysis,
then we would expect an increase in kex for Val14γ1 in F105Y–AZTMP versus WT–AZTMP that
is consistent with the 20-fold difference in their catalytic rates.
However, a mere 1.5-fold increase is observed. This and other more
widespread dynamical perturbations suggest a more nuanced mechanism.
This leads us to suggest a tuning model for efficient phosphorylation
of AZTMP by F105Y hTMPK. AZTMP is destabilizing to the active site
of the enzyme, where the F105Y mutation is overly stabilizing, leading
to a decrease in the catalytic rate with TMP. Both of these effects
combined counterbalance the instability caused by AZTMP with conformational
exchange occurring on approximately the same timescale in F105Y–AZTMP
as WT–TMP.

Not all regions of the protein have their
dynamics affected by
the mutation or different sets of ligands. Leu167δ1 is located
at the base of α6, and its exchange rates are similar for all
four complexes, suggesting it is monitoring a motion that is unrelated
to the catalytic cycle. A number of residues do not seem to show conformational
exchange in any of the four (WT or F105Y with TMP or AZTMP) complexes
discussed here. These residues are mostly located in the hydrophobic
core, distal from the active site (Figure S5). Interestingly, Val94γ2, which resides on the opposite side
of the β-sheet from Val95γ2, does not show exchange despite
being so close in sequence. This suggests that dynamical perturbations
are local to the ligand binding and catalytic domains and reinforces
the fact that the average solution structures of the complexes studied
here are the same.

AZTMP Affects Adenosine Nucleotide Handling
in WT hTMPK
Because of the large ring current effect, Ile184δ1
serves as
a powerful probe of ADP saturation and adenosine ring dynamics. The
presence of a fast exchange process under saturating conditions of
ADP suggests that the adenine ring is mobile within the WT enzyme.
The WT–AZTMP complex has a 3-fold increase in kex and a 20-fold increase in φex, suggesting
the adenine ring is quite mobile compared to the WT–TMP complex.
In addition to Ile184, the adenine ring is held in place by a cation−π
interaction with Arg143 in the LID on the C-terminal end of α6,
which contains Leu137 (see Figure 9). This leucine shows an increased φex in WT–AZTMP, consistent with a dynamical perturbation in
this region that may be mediated by Arg143. It is clear from both
the RD parameters and 2-fold increase in koff for ADP with AZTMP bound, that ADP handling is different in the
WT–AZTMP complex than in the TMP complex. This may involve
a disruption in communication between these regions that is mediated
by the guanidinium group of Arg143, which interacts with the adenine
ring and 2 hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyls of Arg16 (P-loop)
and Ala180 (A-loop) (Figure 9). Likewise, perturbations to P-loop dynamics may propagate
to the LID through the sidechain of Arg16. It is important to note
that these differences could be observed even without the presence
of a γ-phosphate, as it seems this was required in the crystallographic
data.

Figure 9 Dynamic events in the Adenosine-binding site are propagated to
nearby residues by the Arg143 guanidino–adenine interactions.

Catalytic Rate of F105Y hTMPK Is Reduced
Because of Altered
ADP Binding and Transition State Dynamics
While the F105Y
mutant is supposedly predisposed to enter the catalytically active
“P-loop closed” state, it does have a four-fold reduced
catalytic rate for TMP phosphorylation. The ADP titration suggests
that F105Y hTMPK has increased affinity for ADP, and Ile184δ1
shows no exchange for both 2 and 8 mM samples of either F105Y complex.
Human TMPK has been shown to follow a random bi–bi mechanism
suggesting that the order of product release is random; however, a
recent random accelerated molecular dynamics study of WT hTMPK suggests
that TDP release pathways are largely biased toward the residues immediately
following α6 in the LID whether or not ADP had already dissociated.41 This suggests slower ADP release may be responsible
for some loss in activity of the F105Y enzyme. This region is stabilized
in the F105Y complexes, as reported on by Leu137δ1.

A
second mechanism for loss of activity is indicated by the exchange
parameters for the F105Y Ap5dT complex, which show a reduced
population of the minor state across the residues in the ATP-binding
site (Val14, Leu137, Leu161, and Ile184) as compared to WT. Because
Ap5dT induces the closed form of the enzyme, we assign
the excited state to a previously uncharacterized catalytically required
intermediate. Because the F105Y mutation reduces conformational motion
in the ATP-binding site, it is less favorable to encounter this intermediate,
resulting in a reduced catalytic rate. The combined effects of slow
product release and a less populated active state may explain the
loss in activity for F105Y hTMPK.

Conclusions
Despite
minor structural differences between WT hTMPK bound to
either TMP or AZTMP and ADP from crystallography and 2D NMR spectra,
it is clear that these complexes show significant differences in dynamics
on the μs to ms time scale. CPMG-RD techniques reveal that AZTMP
induces widespread dynamical perturbations to the P-loop, LID, and
at the catalytically important DRX motif. These perturbations likely
stem from, but are not limited to, the steric clash between the 3′-azido
group of AZTMP and Asp15, preventing its formation of hydrogen bonds
with Arg97 of the DRX motif and also with Gln157 on α7. The
F105Y mutation is able to overcome this steric clash by effectively
pinning the P-loop to the NMP-binding site. This reduces conformational
dynamics in the ATP-binding site, resulting in increased affinity
for the product ADP. The high activity of F105Y hTMPK toward AZTMP
stems from proper tuning of the dynamics of the active site in the
AZTMP complex, which mimics the WT–TMP complex and predisposes
Arg45 and Arg97 into the catalytically active positions. However,
in the F105Y Ap5dT complex, a global reduction in the excited
state may explain the reduced activity for TMP.

Our results
with hTMPK illustrate that the importance of intrinsic
motions of the enzyme to the catalytic mechanism of nucleotide kinases
is not restricted to AMPK. As with AMPK,16,33,36 we have shown that the dynamic properties
of the enzyme can be altered by a mutation, F105Y. We also have shown
that catalysis can also be tuned by changes in the substrate, that
is, AZTMP versus TMP. These insights into the intricate internal motions
which dictate substrate specificity may serve as a guide for the future
design of allosteric activators of hTMPK that would enhance metabolic
AZT phosphorylation to increase the efficacy of AZT to act as an inhibitor
of DNA polymerases. In addition, changes in dynamics may be important
to consider in the design of inhibitors that would be useful in cancer
chemotherapy. A better understanding of the human enzyme will also
assist in the development of agents which are specific for antimalarial42 and antifungal43 thymidylate
kinases.

Materials and Methods
Protein Expression, Purification, and Characterization
The synthetic gene codon-optimized for expression of the N-terminally
(His)6 tagged protein in E. coli was obtained from ATUM and cloned into the pET22b(+) vector using
the NdeI and XhoI sites. The protein was expressed in C3013 T7 Express lysY/lacIq E. coli cells (New England Biolabs).

The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 mg/L
ampicillin at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl
β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 4 h. For specifically
ILV-labeled proteins, cells were grown in Studier’s PG medium44 with 1,2,3,4,5,6,6-d7d-glucose
and ammonium-15N2 sulfate in 100% D2O. ILV precursors, 13CH3 or 13CHD2 α-ketoisovalerate (100 mg/L), and α-ketobutyrate
(50 mg/L) were added 1 h prior to induction at an A600 of 1.6 with
IPTG for 20 h.45 After harvesting, the
cells were stored at −80 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended
in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 10
mM imidazole, 20 mM MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 50 μM
TMP, pH 7.4) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at
20,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. HisPur Cobalt Resin
(Thermo Scientific) was added to the supernatant and mixed on an end-over-end
rotator for 1 h. This supernatant/resin mix was poured into a gravity
chromatography column to separate the resin from the flow-through.
The resin was washed with three column volumes of wash buffer (50
mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM imidazole,
pH 7.4). The protein was then eluted with the elution buffer (50 mM
sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 500 mM imidazole, pH
7.4). The eluted protein was dialyzed against the cation exchange
buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, pH 7.0) and loaded on a SP Sephadex C-50 (Sigma) column equilibrated
with the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient
(0.05–1.5 M NaCl) and concentrated. Average yields of 100 mg/L
of culture were achieved.

Protein purity was assessed using
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis or 2D-NMR spectroscopy, and samples were >95%
pure. Activity toward dTMP and AZTMP was measured using a standard
NADH coupled assay,46 and protein concentration
was determined from A280 using an extinction
coefficient of 26,470 M–1 cm–1, which was calculated from the sequence using the ProtParam utility
on the ExPASy server.47 Measured values
of kCAT for both the WT and F105Y enzymes
were within 10% of values reported in the literature.

NMR Spectroscopy
1H–13C HMQC spectra were acquired
on a 600 MHz Bruker AMX spectrometer
equipped with a room temperature probe, 4D methyl HMQC-NOE-HMQC spectra
were acquired on a 700 MHz Bruker-BioSpin Avance spectrometer equipped
with a cryo-probe, and CHD2 methyl 1H CPMG experiments48 and CHD2 methyl 13C R1 and R1ρ(49) experiments were acquired on a 600 MHz Bruker
AVIII spectrometer both equipped with a cryo-probe. All samples were
prepared as 0.4–0.8 mM solutions of protein in the NMR buffer
(20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 6.9) dissolved in 100% D2O. TMP, AZTMP, and ADP at a concentration of 2 mM were added for
HMQC, NOE, and R1 and R1ρ experiments. For the CPMG experiments, the concentration
of ADP was raised to 8 mM to fully saturate the enzyme. A concentration
of 0.84 mM Ap5dT was used for CPMG experiments. Spectra
were taken at 34 °C. CHD2 methyl 1H CPMG
was acquired with a Trelax (total time
of the CPMG pulse train) of 40 ms and taken for ncyc (number of CPMG elements) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 16, 18, 20, 26, 32, 40, and 78. CPMG data for
TMP and AZTMP samples were acquired at 600 and 850 MHz. CPMG data
for Ap5dT was acquired at 850 MHz. Several ncyc values were sampled twice to obtain an estimate of
the experimental noise. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe and
visualized with nmrDraw.50

Resonance Assignments
Ile (δ1), stereospecific
Leu (δ1 and δ2), and Val (γ1 and γ2) assignments
of the WT–TMP/ADP/Mg2+ complex were obtained by
a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, pro-S labeling of LV methyl groups, and three (3D) and four-dimensional
(4D) methyl–methyl NOE that resulted in self-consistent assignments.
The assignment of Ile and Val methyl resonances greatly increased
the information on dynamics because huTMPK only has 6 Ile residues.

Single-site (Ile → Val) mutations were generated in the
WT protein for all Ile residues except Ile49. DNA primers for mutagenesis
were obtained from IDT DNA, and mutations were generated using the
QuickChange Kit (Agilent). The assignment of Ile49 in the F105Y spectra
was confirmed by an Ile49 to Val mutation, which removed the peak
from Ile49 from the F105Y spectrum. The ILV NMR spectra of these mutants
were essentially the same as the parent protein (see Figure S1, panel K), with the exception of the loss of an
Ile peak and the gain of two new Val peaks, indicating that the overall
fold of the mutant protein was identical to the parent and therefore
provided reliable information for Ile assignments. The assignment
of Ile184 was also supported by its large chemical shift change because
of the binding of ADP.

A number of Leu and Val residues (Val
→ Ala and Leu →
Val) were also selected for mutagenesis to provide additional starting
points for assignment using NOEs. The 1H–13C HMQC spectra of these mutant proteins showed a pair of missing
resonances (Val) or the shift of two resonances from the Leu region
to the Val region of the spectrum. NMR spectra of all of the mutants
were essentially identical to the WT spectrum, with the exception
of a missing peak corresponding to the altered residue (see Figure S1, panels (A–J)). The high similarity
between the mutant and the WT spectra indicates that the mutation
did not affect the overall structure of the protein such that the
mutation provided reliable information for assignments.

The
X-ray structures of the hTMPK in the complex with TMP and ADP
(PDB 1E2G) permitted
the use of NOE experiments to assign most of the ILV methyl peaks
and confirm the peaks already assigned by mutagenesis. The 4D methyl
HMQC-NOE-HMQC pulse program was obtained from Clore (http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/clore/Software/software.html).51 Two differently labeled ILV [13C]methyl-labeled samples were produced for the 4D NOE experiments.
The first NOE sample was produced using 4-[13C]-α-ketobutyric
acid (2-KB) and dimethyl[13C2]-α-ketoisovaleric
acid as the precursors for ILV labeling.52 The precursor dimethyl[13C2]-α-ketoisovaleric
acid introduces 13C into all LV methyl groups and gives
a strong intraresidue NOE peak in the 4D NOE spectrum. This allowed
identification of the methyl pairs for LV residues. The second sample
was produced from precursors 2-KB and 3-methyl[13C]-3,4,4,4-[2H4]-α-ketoisovaleric acid. This resulted
in LV side chains with 13CH3 and 12CD3 methyl groups. The NOE spectrum of this sample lacked
the strong intraresidue peak and permitted detection of NOEs over
longer distances because of the absence of transfer to the other methyl
on the same residue. 4D NOE data at one mixing time along with the
mutagenesis and specific labeling experiments were not enough to confidently
assign some of the residues. In such cases, we relied on the dependence
of NOE intensities on mixing time. A series of 3D methyl NOE experiments
were acquired with different NOE mixing times (100–900 ms),
and the experimental data were compared to the simulated data. This
approach helped in resolving inconclusive assignments and reaffirmed
previous assignments (see Figure S2).

Specific labeling of the pro-S methyl groups of
Leu (δ2-CH3) and Val (γ2-CH3) was
achieved by expressing the protein in the presence of 2-[13CH3]methyl-4-[2H3]acetolactate (NMR-Bio).53 The resulting methyl spectra consist of only
the pro-S methyl peaks. Peaks that were not labeled
using this protocol were identified as pro-R peaks
(see Figure S3).

Measuring ADP Binding Affinity
A series of 1H–13C HMQC spectra were
acquired for concentrations
of ADP ranging from 0 to 2.4 ligand-to-protein ratio for WT or F105Y
bound to either TMP or AZTMP. The concentration of the protein for
the WT and F105Y samples were 0.8 and 0.4 mM, respectively. The concentration
of TMP and AZTMP was 2 mM, giving greater than 98% saturation. It
was not possible to measure the ADP binding in the absence of TMP
or AZTMP because of protein instability.

Spectra were processed
as above, except exponential line broadening was used instead of sine-bell
apodization. The observed dissociation constant (KD) and off-rate (koff) for
ADP with either TMP or AZTMP were determined using two-dimensional
line fitting using the TITAN37 program,
utilizing five resonance lines that moved upon addition of ADP (Leu161δ1,
Ile184δ1, Ile191δ1, Ile199δ1, and Val193δ1)
for each of the four samples. The simple 2-state binding model [P]
+ [L] ⇌ [PL] was chosen, and errors were estimated using the
built-in bootstrap procedure in TITAN.

13C Relaxation
Data Analysis
The 13C R1 and R1ρ relaxation rates were
used to extract S2 order parameters for
each of the ILV methyl groups using the method
of Tugarinov and Kay.49 The anisotropic
rotational diffusion tensor used in the calculations was obtained
using HYDRONMR54 and the X-ray structure
of hTMPK (PDB: 1e2d). The local proton concentration was calculated using an in-house
R script. S2 order parameters were calculated
using the 13C relaxation measurements, diffusion tensor,
and proton concentration, using MATLAB scripts provided by Tugarinov.

RD Data Analysis
NMR spectra were processed without
linear prediction, and peak intensities were extracted using nmrPipe
and nmrDraw.50 Dispersion curves were produced
by calculating  and plotting against the rate
of refocusing
pulses, νCPMG = ncyc/Trelax, where R2,eff is the effective transverse relaxation rate, ncyc is the number of CPMG elements, Trelax is the total time of the relaxation delay, and I(0) and I(νCPMG) are
the intensities at a refocusing pulse rate of 0 and νCPMG, respectively. The rate of interconversion between states (kex), relative populations in each state (pa, pb), and the
difference in chemical shift between the two states (Δω)
were extracted from global fits of the data to either a model suitable
for spins in fast exchange55 1  or the equation that applies to all exchange
rates56 (see Supporting Information), using
an in-house Python program. Note, ΔR20 = R2A0 – R2B0 was assumed to be 0. In the case of fast exchange, a single parameter,
φex was substituted for papbΔω2 in eq 1 because the relatively
small difference in the magnetic field strengths does not permit a
robust deconvolution of Δω from papb. The parameters kex, R20, and φex,(or pa and Δω in favorable cases) were determined
using grid search with a grid size of 10 × 10 × 10 for fast
exchange and 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 for the full model (eq S2). A single Δω was fit to curves
from all fields and scaled by the ratio of the static fields. Goodness
of fit was determined using the reduced χ2 statistic.
Errors for the TMP and AZTMP datasets were estimated using a bootstrap
method, where the dispersion curves were resampled with replacement
to generate 100 artificial datasets and fit using the same grid search
method as the real data. The errors for the Ap5dT data
were estimated using a Monte Carlo method because data was acquired
at one field (850 MHz). Artificial data sets were generated by adding
normally distributed noise with a standard deviation equal to the
propagated measurement error and residual from the fit to each of
the data points. In both cases, 100 artificial data sets were fit
using the same grid search method as the real data. Errors are presented
as ±2 standard error from the mean.
