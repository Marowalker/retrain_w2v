Solar
water splitting is a clean and sustainable process for green
hydrogen production. It can reduce the fossil fuel consumption. Tantalum
nitride (Ta3N5) is one of the limited candidates
of semiconductors, which absorb a broad range of visible light and
are thermodynamically able to split water without external bias potential.
In the present work, we introduce a facile method to prepare a nanostructured
Ta3N5 photoanode in a two-step process: hydrothermal
deposition of perovskite-type NaTaO3 in a hydrofluoric
acid-free NaOH aqueous solution followed by heat treatment in NH3 atmosphere. The resulted bare Ta3N5 electrode was subsequently modified with a Ni-doped CoFeOx (Ni:CoFeOx) as
a water oxidation catalyst. After the cocatalyst loading, the electrode
shows a photocurrent of about 5.3 mA cm–2 at 1.23
V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. The electrode maintained about
82% of its initial photocurrent after 7 h irradiation. In addition,
a continuous oxygen evolution occurred for 3 h at Faraday efficiency
of 96%. This performance is superior to that of the single-layer-modified Ta3N5 photoanodes reported so far. This remarkable
improvement on the photochemical performance could be due to the uniform
nanostructured surface morphology of the present Ta3N5 photoanode. Other alkaline salt treatments, such as LiOH
and KOH, do not give such nanostructured morphology and accordingly
exhibit lower performance than the one treated in NaOH.

Introduction
Solar water splitting
is admittedly a promising alternative process
of hydrogen production due to its cleanness and sustainability.1−4 Further studies, however, are required to improve the overall efficiency,
the durability, and the cost of the photoconversion materials, as
well as the optimization of the water splitting systems for their
practical use. Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) is a
promising choice among the limited candidates of photoanodes, which
absorb majority of visible light and are thermodynamically able to
split water without any external bias potential.5,6 Therefore,
Ta3N5 has recently attracted attentions to its
solar water splitting application.7−14 The photochemical properties of the semiconductor photoelectrodes
are governed by several factors including crystallinity, surface area,
electrical conductivity and charge transport, carrier density and
lifetime, band gap, and band edges. Particularly, the increased surface
area of the nanostructured photoelectrodes increases the amount of
cocatalyst loaded on the electrode surface. Subsequently, improved
water splitting performance can be achieved. Nevertheless, there are
a limited number of attempts to prepare nanostructured Ta3N5 photoelectrodes for solar water splitting applications.

Ta3N5 is basically prepared by nitrization
of the corresponding precursor oxides.15 Thus, the preparation of TaOx-based
precursors with improved properties is indispensible to the production
of Ta3N5 photoelectodes exhibiting an improved
photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. There have
been several attempts to produce TaOx-based
precursors in different surface morphologies. For instance, nanotube
arrays of the tantalum oxide precursor electrodes were grown by electrochemical
anodization technique in a hydrofluoric acid (HF)-containing highly
acidic solution.16−19 Furthermore, nanorod arrays were deposited by the following three
methods: the through-mask anodization in an acidic solution at a direct
current bias voltage as high as 650 V, hydrothermal technique in a
HF-containing solution at an elevated temperature (240 °C) for
24 h, or vapor-phase hydrothermal induced self-assembly technique
in HF-containing bath at 200 °C for 6 h or 180 °C for 24
h.20−24

In our recent publication, we utilized the anodic spark deposition
(ASD), which is a facile technique, to fabricate a highly active and
a tightly adhesive Ta3N5 layer on the Ta substrate.25 However, the control on the surface morphology
of the resultant electrodes is still challenging in the use of the
ASD.

As another way, hydrothermal treatment of Ta metal in alkaline
solutions has been reported to prepare (Ta, Na)Ox25−27 and (Ta, K)Ox.28 Generally, Ta oxide formation from metal Ta
requires a higher concentration of bases and elevated temperature.
In the present study, we optimized the preparation conditions of MTaOn precursors (M = Na, K) to enhance the PEC water
oxidation performance (photocurrent and photostability) of the resultant
Ta3N5 electrodes. In summary, the NaTaO3 precursor were prepared in a pure NaOH aqueous solution (23
wt %) at 250 °C for 5 h, at higher temperature and longer reaction
time than those of the reported ones.25−27 These conditions gave
the best PEC water oxidation performance among the others, after the
conversion to the corresponding Ta3N5 and modification
with the cocatalyst. To the best of our knowledge, the present study
is the first report of the preparation of nanostructured Ta3N5 photoanodes through the hydrothermal method in a F–-free alkaline solution.

Results and Discussion
Optimization
of Hydrothermal Conditions
For the preparation
of MTaOx, we optimized the key factors
of the hydrothermal process, i.e., alkaline salt concentration, temperature,
and reaction time.

First, in the use of NaOH solution, samples
deposited in baths containing 23 wt % NaOH solution under the following
two conditions: at 250 °C, 5 h and at 200 °C, 8 h. Their
nanostructures surface morphologies are shown in Figure S2. The figure reveals that the nanostructures are
more distinguishable on samples deposited at the higher temperature
(250 °C). This could explain the higher photoactivity of samples
deposited at 250 °C (Figure S3). However,
even at temperatures as high as 250 °C, the samples deposited
in solutions with lower NaOH concentration (e.g., 16 wt %) and those
deposited at shorter deposition time (e.g., 3 h) did not show clear
nanostructures at their surfaces, as shown in Figures S4 and S5, respectively. Additionally, uniform TaOx precursor samples could not be successfully
deposited at lower deposition temperatures (e.g., 150 °C) or
at lower NaOH concentrations (e.g., 13 wt %).

When KOH solution
is used, the oxidation reaction of the Ta foil
in the solution seems much faster than that in NaOH, since uniform
TaOx-based precursor samples were deposited
even at 150 °C for a short deposition time of 1 h. The resultant
cocatalyst-loaded Ta3N5 sample showed remarkable
photoactivity (∼4.0 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), as shown in Figure S6. In addition, the figure reveals that the photoactivity
was relatively deteriorated when the deposition time was extended
to 3 h. This could be due to the formation of microcracks at the film–substrate
interface, as shown in Figure S7. Furthermore,
the figure reveals that lower temperature (e.g., 120 °C) is not
suitable to deposit samples with acceptable performance. It is worthy
to mention that films grown at higher temperature (200 °C) were
fragile and partially washed out during postdeposition cleaning. This
could be due to the increased growth rate of TaOx-based precursor in KOH at such high temperature.

When LiOH solution is used, TaOx-based
precursor thin film growth is very slow even at 250 °C for 24
h. After that treatment, the resultant Ta metal surface showed metallic
luster. Thus, the LiOH treatment is excluded from our further study.

In summary, NaOH and KOH alkaline salts react actively with the
Ta sheet in the hydrothermal process and result in the formation of
the TaOx-based material. The optimal deposition
conditions of the precursor TaOx-based
sample in NaOH solution are (NaOH 23 wt %; 250 °C; 5 h) and that
for KOH is (KOH 16 wt %; 150 °C; 1 h). For simplicity, Ta3N5 samples, whose precursor films were prepared
through the optimal deposition condition in NaOH and KOH solutions,
are named S–NaOH and S–KOH, respectively.

Characterizations
of Alkaline-Treated Precursor Electrodes
Structural Measurements
The X-ray diffraction spectra
measurement of the precursor electrodes shows that the precursor film
grown in NaOH solution at 250 °C for 5 h is a single-phase NaTaO3 (PDF card no. 25-0863) with perovskite structure as shown
in Figure S8 and that grown in the KOH
solution at 150 °C for 3 h is a single-phase pyrochlorate-type
K2Ta2O6 (PDF card no. 35-1464) as
shown in Figure S9. Therefore, the precursor
NaTaO3 and K2Ta2O6 electrodes
are most likely formed in a two-step hydrothermal process: initially,
a Ta2O5 thin film was formed on top of the Ta
substrate and Ta2O5 was finally converted to
NaTaO3 or K2Ta2O6 in NaOH
or KOH solution, respectively.28,29 In addition, Figure 1 shows the X-ray
diffraction spectra of the two films after thermal annealing in ammonia
atmosphere. In both cases, all peaks are of polycrystalline Ta3N5 (PDF card no. 79-1533), whereas other peaks
denoted the presence of the tantalum subnitride phases, i.e., TaN
(PDF card no. 39-1485) and Ta2N (PDF card no. 26-0985)
in addition to another peak that represents the Ta substrate (PDF
card no. 04-0788). The subnitride phases are most likely grown at
the interface between Ta3N5 and Ta substrate
as previously reported.22 It is widely
accepted that the electrical conductivity of the subnitride phases
is higher than that of Ta3N5 phase.22 The presence of such a conductive thin layer
at the interface could facilitate the transfer of the photogenerated
electrons from Ta3N5 to the Ta substrate and
thus enhance the photoactivity of the photoanode.

are grown (a) in 23 wt % NaOH solution
at 250 °C for 5 h and (b) in 16 wt % KOH solution at 150 °C
for 1 h after annealing in NH3 at 1000 °C for 2 h.

Morphology Measurements
Figure 2a–d
shows the surface morphologies
and the cross-sectional images of the produced Ta3N5 electrodes. The measurements denoted that the S–NaOH
electrode is composed of homogeneously distributed nanoparticles of
size 50–100 nm on the film surface as shown in Figure 2a. The low-magnification surface
image (Figure S10) revealed that the film
is generally smooth without voids or cracks. The cross-sectional image
(Figure 2b) showed
that the film thickness is about 7.0 μm, and there is no observation
of voids or cracks at the film/substrate interface that may denote
the tight adhesion of the film to the substrate. The perfect mechanical
connection between the film and the substrate was confirmed by the
high stability of the film under 2 min of sonication in pure water
and acetone sequentially. However, the top-view image of the S–KOH
sample (Figure 2c)
does not show distinguished nanoparticles on the film surface. Moreover,
the low-magnification surface image of this sample, shown in Figure S11, revealed that the film is generally
rough with obvious superficial cracks. Regarding the film adhesion
to the base metal, the film of S–KOH sample seems not strong:
most of the materials left the surface during the 2 min ultrasonic
treatment. This observation becomes clear when the hydrothermal deposition
time extended to 3 h: obvious voids and cracks are generated at the
film–substrate interface as shown in Figure S7. It is worthy to conclude that the S–NaOH compared
with the S–KOH sample has a better surface morphology with
an increased surface area due to the nanostructure formation and a
stronger mechanical adhesion to the substrate.

views).

Cocatalyst Loading
Pristine S–NaOH and S–KOH
samples were modified with Fe–Ni–Co mixed metal oxides,
as a water oxidation catalyst, for photoelectrochemical water oxidation
measurements. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the Fe 2p,
Co 2p, and Ni 2p core levels are shown in Figure S12. The atomic percentages of Fe, Co, and Ni metals, calculated
based on the 2p3/2 spectra of iron, cobalt, and nickel,
are about 39.0, 59.0, and 2.0, respectively. This result agrees well
with the quantitative study of the deposited cocatalyst by the inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, which revealed that the atomic percentages
of Fe, Co, and Ni are about 36.2, 56.5, and 7.3%, respectively. Therefore,
the cocatalyst is mainly Ni-doped Co–Fe mixed metal oxides,
abbreviated as Ni:CoFeOx. In the present
study, it is worthy to mention that the loading of this cocatalyst
is imperative to achieve a high solar water oxidation performance. Figure S13 reveals that the activity of the bare
Ta3N5 is drastically improved after the cocatalyst
loading. Concerning the stability, the photocurrent of the bare Ta3N5 electrode, unsurprisingly, almost vanished after
few minutes of light illumination, data not shown.

Photoelectrochemical
(PEC) Measurements
The PEC water
oxidation properties of the cocatalyst-modified Ta3N5 (Ni:CoFeOx/Ta3N5) of S–NaOH and S–KOH photoanodes are shown
in Figure 3, which
shows the current–potential curves of the two electrodes. Under
dark conditions, the samples show negligibly low current in the selected
voltage range 0.5–1.23 V vs RHE (hereafter, all voltages referred
to RHE are shown as VRHE). Under light irradiation, the
two samples showed remarkable PEC activity with onset potentials of
about 0.8 and 0.76 V for Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH
and Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH, respectively.
It is noteworthy that the current Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH sample has a sharp increase with the applied voltage;
however, that of Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH
tends to saturate as the voltage increases. The increased surface
area of S–NaOH could be due to its nanostructured surface morphology
that facilitates charge separation at the electrode–electrolyte
interface. The amount of the loaded cocatalyst on the S–NaOH
and S–KOH samples based on the ICP measurements are ∼16.36
and ∼11.22 μg cm–2, respectively. These
results confirm that S–NaOH has a larger surface area than
S–KOH. In addition, the Mott–Schottky plots (Figure S14), which are derived from the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of bare S–NaOH and
S–KOH samples under dark condition, revealed that the donor
concentration of the S–NaOH sample is clearly higher than that
of the S–KOH one, 1022 and 1020 cm–3, respectively. Therefore, the increased surface area
and the higher donor concentration of the S–NaOH sample compared
to those of the S–KOH sample may explain its superior photoactivity.

curves and (b) current–time curves
at 1.23 VRHE of Ni:CoFeOx-loaded
Ta3N5, whose precursor electrodes grown in the
23 wt % NaOH solution at 250 °C for 5 h (black) and in the 16
wt % KOH solution at 150 °C for 1 h (red) under dark (broken)
and light (solid) conditions (100 mW cm–2) in 1
M NaOH (pH 13.6) electrolyte.

In the next, photocurrents of cocatalyst-modified Ta3N5 electrodes were observed in the 1 M NaOH solution. Figure 3b shows the bulk
photoelectrolysis of the two samples measured at 1.23 V under light
irradiation. The Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH
electrode shows an initial photocurrent of about 4.3 mA cm–2, which decreased about 50% of the initial value after 3 h due to
significant photocorrosion. However, the Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH sample has a significantly increased photocurrent
(initially ∼5.3 mA cm–2) compared to Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH. The stability of S–NaOH
is remarkably better than that of Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH: about 82% of the initial current remains after about
7 h of photoreaction. To the best of our knowledge, the water oxidation
performance of the present Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH
sample is superior to that of other nanostructured Ta3N5-based photoelectrodes reported so far, as shown in Table S1. Thus, the nanostructured surface morphology
of the current Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH
electrode leads to remarkable improvement on the PEC water oxidation
efficiency of the photoanode compared to those of the previously reported
(Ta3N5-ASD) by our group, although the two samples
have been modified with the same electrocatalyst: the current increased
by about 35% and the stability test extended to 7 h instead of only
2 h. This could be mainly due to the increased surface area of the
nanostructure morphology of the current photoanode.

Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
The measurement
aims at examining the interfacial properties between the electrode
and the electrolyte; the Nyquist plot as well as the related equivalent
circuit are shown in Figure 4. Based on the widely accepted equivalent circuit of the Ta3N5-based photoanode, the semiconductor–electrolyte
charge-transfer resistance, Rct, is the
key parameter to characterize the semiconductor–electrolyte
charge-transfer process.10,19 The fitted values of Rct are 445.2 and 1105 Ω for the Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH and Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH photoanodes, respectively. This means that
the formation of nanostructures reduced the charge-transfer resistance
remarkably and thus decreased the recombination of photogenerated
carriers. Accordingly, the photoactivity and the photoelectrochemical
stability of the electrode were remarkably improved. Additionally,
the capacitance C is 998.2 and 11.7 μF and
the series resistance RS is 10.63 and
8.93 Ω for the Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH
and Ni:CoFeOx/S–KOH photoanodes,
respectively. The presence of the low-resistive subnitrides (namely,
TaN, Ta2N) at the Ta–Ta3N5 interface may explain these relatively low series resistances.

the charge-transfer behavior across the electrode–electrolyte
interface.

Water Oxidation Performance
Since the nanostructured
Ni:CoFeOx-modified S–NaOH samples
possess remarkably improved photocurrent and stability, the wavelength
dependence of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency
(IPCE) and the gas detection measurements have been additionally performed
for them to examine their water oxidation performance. Figure 5a shows the IPCE and the integrated
photocurrent that is theoretically estimated by integrating the IPCE
over the standard solar spectrum of the ASTM G173-03 for the Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH sample at 1.23 V. The resultant
IPCE is about 55% in a wavelength range of 400–520 nm and the
photoresponse wavelength is up to ≈620 nm, which is close to
the absorption edge of Ta3N5 as shown in Figure S15. The theoretically calculated and
the actually measured photocurrents are 5.5 and 5.3 mA cm–2, respectively. This reveals the reliability of our IPCE measurement.
Additionally, the calculated value of the applied bias photon-to-current
efficiency (ABPE) is about 0.83% at 1.0 V vs RHE. This efficiency
is slightly lower than the recently reported value (1.0%) for the
CoPi/Ta3N5 photoanode, in which Ta3N5 was prepared by sputtering–nitridation process.12 However, we owe the advantage of the present
work to the simplicity, the cost-effectiveness, and the ability of
large-scale preparation of the hydrothermal method.

Figure 5 (a) IPCE values, the
integrated photocurrent estimated by integrating
the IPCE values over the standard solar spectrum of the AM1.5G (ASTM
G173-03), are also shown and (b) the theoretically estimated and the
evolved oxygen gas of Ni:CoFeOx/Ta3N5 photoanode at 1.23 VRHE potential
under light (100 mW cm–2) quantified by GC.

Figure 5b shows
the detected amount of oxygen gas evolved at the Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH electrode during 3 h of illumination
(100 mW cm–2) at 1.23 VRHE in 1 M NaOH.
The measurement showed a continuous evolution of oxygen, with the
Faraday efficiency of 96%. Such a high efficiency confirmed that the
majority of photogenerated holes of Ta3N5 were
effectively consumed to oxidize water. Simultaneously, vigorous evolution
of oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles was observed during the experiment
on the Ni:CoFeOx/S–NaOH electrode
and platinum electrode, respectively.

Conclusions
Single-phase NaTaO3 and K2Ta2O6 thin films were successfully prepared onto tantalum substrates
by the hydrothermal reaction in the NaOH and KOH solution, respectively.
The as-grown electrodes were converted to Ta3N5 through heat treatment in NH3 atmosphere at 1000 °C
for 2 h. The Ta3N5 sample, whose precursor,
the TaOx-based electrode, was produced
by optimized hydrothermal deposition in NaOH solution (S–NaOH),
possesses nanostructured morphology; however, that whose precursor
electrode was perpetrated in KOH solution (S–KOH) shows a rough
morphology without distinguished nanostructures at its surface. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the preparation
of nanostructured Ta3N5 photoanodes through
the hydrothermal treatment in HF-free medium. The bare Ta3N5 electrodes were simply modified with the Ni:CoFeOx cocatalyst by the photoassisted electrochemical
deposition. The cocatalyst-modified S–NaOH photoanode showed
a photocurrent ∼5.3 mA cm–2 at 1.23 VRHE, and about 82% of its initial value remained after about
7 h of photoirradiation. The modified photoanode produced oxygen gas
continuously for 3 h at the quantitative Faraday efficiency of 96%.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Ta3N5 Films
First,
pieces of Ta foil (25 mm × 30 mm × 0.2 mm, 99.95%, Nilaco)
were sequentially cleaned by sonication for 10 min successively in
acetone, isopropanol, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water. The hydrothermal
technique has been used to prepare sodium-tantalum [(Na, Ta)Ox] and potassium-tantalum mixed oxide [(K, Ta)Ox] films onto the Ta foil. In this process, a
Teflon liner autoclave (140 mL) containing the cleaned Ta foil immersed
in a concentrated aqueous solution of NaOH or KOH (100 mL) was heated
up in a muffle furnace. The autoclave was left to cool down naturally
in open air after a certain deposition time. The alkaline salt concentration
(wt %), the heating temperature, and the deposition time were optimized
as discussed hereinafter to achieve the optimal water oxidation performance.
After the deposition, the film was rinsed with a diluted aqueous HCl
solution and DI water, sequentially. Afterward, the prepared precursor
electrodes were converted to Ta3N5 material
through thermal annealing in ammonia atmosphere (NH3, flow
rate: ∼200 mL min–1) at 1000 °C for
2 h in an alumina tube. A schematic diagram of the main steps of the
sample preparation is shown in Figure S1.

Deposition of Ni:CoFeOx Cocatalyst
Sixteen millimolar of nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate, 16 mM of
anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride, and 5 mM of iron(III) sulfate were
dissolved in DI water. The pH value of the resulted aqueous solution
was about 5.3.30 The cocatalyst was deposited
through the light-assisted electrochemical deposition in a three-electrode
cell: platinum as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (in 3 M NaCl) as a
reference electrode, and bare Ta3N5 electrode
as a working electrode. A voltage sweep voltammetry (in a range of
0.1–0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) was applied for five cycles under light
with the intensity of 100 mW cm–2.25

Spectroscopic Characterizations of Electrodes
The high-resolution
field emission scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM; Hitachi Model
S-4300) operated at 15 kV accelerating voltage was utilized to examine
the surface morphology as well as the cross section of the samples.
The X-ray diffraction (Rigaku RINT-2100/PC) spectra were detected
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm, operated at 40
kV and 40 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Ulvac Phi VersaProbe
CU) using Mg Kα radiation at 10 mA and 8 kV was utilized. Inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer (Rigaku ICPE-9810) was used to quantify
the amount of loaded cocatalyst on the photoelectrode surface. A gas
chromatograph Shimadzu GC-2014, equipped with a capillary column (0.53
mm i.d. × 15 m) bearing molecular-sieve 5A layer at 40 °C
with Ar, was used to quantify the evolved oxygen gas.

Electrochemical
Measurements
The measurements were
carried out using Autolab Potentiostat/Galvanostat (model PGSTAT128N)
with an electrochemical impedance measurement setup. The three-electrode
cell that was used to deposit the cocatalyst was utilized to examine
the PEC properties of the samples in an alkaline electrolyte (1 M
NaOH, pH 13.6). The photoactivity and the photostability of the samples
were examined under the linear sweep voltammetry (with a voltage range
of 0.5–1.23 V vs RHE at a sweeping rate of 20 mV s–1) and a constant voltage (V = 1.23 V vs RHE) under
dark and light illumination (100 mW cm–2 from a
calibrated 300 W Xenon lamp without an AM1.5 filter).

Incident Photon-to-Current
Efficiency (IPCE)
IPCE was
measured for the Ni:CoFeOx-modified Ta3N5 photoanode at V = 1.23 V vs
RHE under monochromatic light, from a monochromator light source (M10-T,
Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.), at a wavelength range of 400–640 nm
at intervals of 20 nm. The IPCE was calculated according to the following
formula 1  where Iλ (mA cm–2) is the density of the steady-state photocurrent,
λ (nm) is the wavelength of the monochromatic light, and Pinput (mW cm–2) is the incident
photon density measured using a Si photodiode detector S1337-1010BQ
(Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). In addition, the electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) was measured for the pristine and the cocatalyst-modified
Ta3N5 photoanodes at potential V = 1.23 V vs RHE in 1 M NaOH solution (pH 13.6) under light illumination.
The amplitude of the applied sinusoidal signal was 10 mV with a frequency
range of 0.1–105 Hz. Furthermore, the Mott–Schottky
analysis for the optimized bare electrodes was performed based on
the EIS measurements under dark condition in an alkaline electrolyte
(1 M NaOH, pH 13.6) in a voltage range of 0.4–0.9 V vs AgCl.
The Mott–Schottky plots enabled us to calculate the donor concentration
of the measured samples based on the following equation.32,33  where C is the capacitance
per unit area (F cm–2), V is the
applied potential (V), q is the electron charge constant
(∼1.6 × 10–19 Coulomb), εo is the permittivity of free space (∼8.85 × 10–14 F cm–1), ε is the dielectric
constant of Ta3N5, and ND is the donor concentration (cm–3).

Faradic
Efficiency
The three-electrode cell was perfectly
sealed and purged with Ar gas for 30 min. The headspace gas was analyzed
by utilizing the GC instrument before and after the measurement. We
ensured that the sealed cell was completely depleted from H2, O2, and N2 gases. In this experiment, the
Ni:CoFeOx/Ta3N5 photoanode
was biased with 1.23 V vs RHE in 1 M NaOH under light illumination
(100 mW cm–2) and the evolved O2 gas
was quantified every 30 min during the experiment. Finally, the Faradic
efficiency of the evolved oxygen was estimated.

cell was used to measure the Faradic efficiency of evolved oxygen.
The Ni:CoFeOx/Ta3N5 photoanode was biased at 1.23 V vs RHE in 1 M NaOH under light illumination
(100 mW cm–2). The cell was sealed and purged by
Ar for 30 min, and no H2, O2, or N2 was detected before the measurement. The headspace gas was analyzed
by using the GC to quantify the evolved O2 gas.

photocurrent density obtained under an applied bias Vb V vs RHE and Ptotal is the
total incident power density (100 mW cm–2).31
