While
polymer-based membranes and the consistent plants and elements have
long been considered
and optimized, there are only few studies on optimization of the new
generation of carbon-based porous membranes for water desalination.
By modeling the elements and their corresponding parameters in a vertical
configuration via COMSOL Multiphysics software, an experimental setup
was modified that contained various bare and carbon nanotube (CNT)-covered
microprocessed porous membranes in parallel and in series. Several
design parameters such as inlet pressure, length of outlet, vertical
distance of the parallel membranes, and horizontal distances of the
series membranes were optimized. Taking advantage of the uttermost
surface area of CNTs and the engineered particle trajectory, almost
90% NaCl rejection and 97% Allura red rejection were obtained with
very high permeation values. Considering microsized outlets, the results
of particle rejections are outstanding owing to the smart design of
the setup. The results of this work can be extended to larger and
smaller scales up to the point where the governing equations still
hold.

1 Introduction
Carbon-based materials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs),1,2 graphene,3−5 graphene oxide,6−9 and porous carbon,10,11 have been
the center of interest for possible replacements of state-of-the-art
polyamide membranes for water desalination. Carbon-based material
candidates have properties superior to those of the current membranes,
including lower surface roughness, higher porosity, hydrophilicity,
and more environment friendly, which can overall improve the efficiency
of the membranes. Among these membranes, CNTs have attracted a lot
of interest in separating water and salt ions due to their high mechanical
strength, high chemical stability, and advanced functionality.12−17 Although there are two main categories of CNT prototypes that have
been realized for separation processes and specifically for water
desalination: mixed matrix CNT membranes18−22 and vertically aligned CNT membranes,23−26 these are not the only ones. Decorating the surface of a porous
membrane with grown CNTs can modify the surface properties and the
large surface area of the CNTs improves the process of rejecting salt
ions and transporting water.27 It has also
been found that the presence of carbon nanotubes can favorably offer
the effective antimicrobial properties to diminish the biofouling
during extended period of filtration.28

In an early report, it was surprisingly found that CNT-decorated
microporous membranes contributed to salt rejection when exposed to
vertical flow of salty water.27 The underlying
mechanism for this rejection was mainly related to the high bar/hole
ratio of the samples and the high surface area of the CNTs.27 But the other aspects of the mechanism may be
related to the dynamics of water and solute transport across such
a system. To understand the details of the rejection mechanism, it
was necessary to model such a system and study theoretically the dynamics
of water flow and particle trajectory across these membranes at millimeter
scale. There are numerous reports on the dynamics of water when passing
through polyamide membranes,29−31 CNTs,32−34 carbon composites,35 nanoporous graphene,36−38 and graphene
oxide39,40 at nanoscales using nonequilibrium, equilibrium,
or classical molecular dynamics. Computational fluid dynamics is a
promising tool that has been employed for optimization of reverse
osmosis (RO) modules41 and desalination
membranes42−44 at submicron scales. To have a general sense of the
dynamics of water and particles as they flow in the whole assembly
of new generation of desalination membrane setups, i.e., from the
inlet all the way to the outlets, millimeter scale calculation is
essential. This large scale of modeling is rarely found in the literature
while polymer-based desalination membranes and the entire consistent
plants that allow reverse osmosis (RO) processes have long been studied
and optimized.

Here, using COMSOL Multiphysics modeling software,
we modeled velocity
field and magnitude of water flow (without particle) approaching several
microporous membranes with varied outlet lengths. The different membranes
were then mounted in parallel with different geometries, akin to application
of spacers in polymer-based desalination membranes. Velocity field,
velocity magnitude, and particle trajectory of water flow (with particles)
were modeled. Equivalent experimental measurements were accompanied
in most cases. From the significant variations in the dynamics of
water and particles in the models, we designed a modified experimental
setup to envisage the improvement in particle rejection across the
membranes. To take the most advantage of the optimized geometry parameters
and the surface area of the membranes, we coupled the two aspects
by using CNT-decorated microporous membranes in an improved experimental
configuration. High salt rejection, high dye rejection, and high water
permeation were obtained in the final configuration and via the uttermost
area of CNTs. The model specifications are not unique to the current
experimental setup and can be extended to a general model to be envisioned
in designing a variety of separation-based apparatus. The scale of
the whole model can be reduced to 2 orders of magnitude while the
results hold for these scales unchangeably.

2 Results
and Discussion

Bare Parallel Supports
2.1.1 Experimental Results
The schematics
of the setup and a tilted view of all individual porous supports used
in particle rejection and water permeation measurements are presented
in Figure 1a. From
G300 to G1500, the size of the holes decreases and the density of
the holes varies, as presented in Table 1. Si25 and Si49 also show a significant difference
in the number and size of the holes. The grid’s outer diameter
is a fixed value of 3.05 mm as they are provided commercially. The
Si porous supports are squares with side length of 10 mm that were
fabricated as discussed in Experimental Section. The water measurement setup (Figure 1b) including the sample holder, the spacers, and vertical
Plexiglas cylinder (with height H2) was designed to accommodate
the larger Si samples and to ensure comparable measurements for both
the grids and the Si supports. This explains why two different bar/hole
ratios are calculated in Table 1; one ratio describes the bar area per hole area in each individual
sample regardless of the size of sample holder and the other is related
to the bar area of the sample regarding the area of the sample holder
(100 mm2) per hole area of the sample. These two ratios
were identical for Si-based supports and significantly different for
the grids.

mm for 104 Pa measurements.

grids and Si49 among

Since our modeling results
were in 2D, the last column in Table 1 shows the number
of holes of each porous support in 2D, i.e., the number of holes across
the diameter of the grids or across the straight line, which connects
the two sides of the square and the center of the square in Si supports. H1 + H2 was the height
of salty water used as the driving force for water transport across
the membranes (Figure 1b). The valve was situated directly above H2 and was opened
when measurements started. Before the measurements, a homogeneous
solution of salty water occupied the whole length of H1. H2 = 10 mm was kept constant
and H1 produced a hydrodynamic pressure
of 103 Pa if H1 ∼ 100
mm and 104 Pa if H1 ∼
1000 mm. Although 104 Pa is smaller than the required osmotic
pressure for water desalination (5–8 MPa), using gravitational
pressure-driven setup in laboratory did not allow much higher pressures.

The inlets (i) and (ii) in Figure 1b schematically demonstrate a grid or a Si porous support
used as the separation membrane in the measurement setup. Inlets (iii)
and (iv) show a single or double grid in parallel with a Si porous
support. These schematics show that from (i) to (iv), water becomes
more purified after passing through the membranes. The 3D schematic
image (v) shows a single G850 directly over Si49 and in parallel to
it, where h1 varies to see the effectiveness
of the vertical spacing between the two membranes. In inlet (vi),
there are six G850 mounted symmetrically on a plane with no holes
in its center, in parallel to and above Si49 at h1 vertical distance. D in this figure
represents the distance between the outer diameters of every two G850
in series.

We performed water permeation and NaCl rejection
measurements on
all of the bare porous supports at 104 Pa. To relate our
experimental results with the results from the modeling, velocity
values were obtained in addition to permeation values through the
following relations 1   2  In relation 1, v (m/s)
is the velocity of the flow
at the outlet, V (m3) is the volume of
the flow passing though the outlets, A (m2) is the area of the outlet, and t (s) is the time
the flow takes to pass through the outlets. For relation 2, there are slight changes in the units of
the quantities since permeation p is usually reported
in the literature with L/(m2 h bar) units and P, the pressure of the inlet, is expressed in bars (bar), V is expressed in liters (L), and t is
expressed in hours (h). Figure 2 summarizes the experimental results of NaCl rejection, and
velocity and permeation of the flow across several porous supports.
The velocity obtained from experiments is the average velocity of
the fluid, and compared to modeling, it is slightly lower than the
maximum velocity in the center of the outlets. It is clear from relation 1 that although v increases with increase in V, it decreases
with the product of A and t. From
fluid dynamics,45t changes
inversely with A and V changes inversely
with t. The larger (smaller) the outlet area of the
fluid, the faster (slower) the fluid passes through with smaller (larger) t and the higher (lower) is the volume V of the fluid that crosses over the outlets.

Images of mounted one and six G850 on Plexiglas that are laser-drilled
with one and six holes, respectively.

For individual porous supports from G300 to Si49, the velocity
of the fluid decreases with decrease of outlet area (Figure 2a). Permeation of the flow
follows the same trend as the velocity. The data are discrete and
connected via β-spline line to demonstrate the trend of changes
more clearly. NaCl rejections of these supports are around 5–8%
in the grids and 20–25% in the microfabricated Si hole array
supports. We explored experimentally what would happen to the velocity
and permeation of the flow and to the NaCl rejection if we combined
grid and Si hole supports.

We knew from the modeling that beyond
5 mm above the outlets, the
flow was laminar all the way up to the serum that contained the feed
solution. Hence, all of the significant variations in velocity field
and magnitude occur in the vicinity of the outlets. This was the reason
we chose a window of 10 mm × 10 mm for all models. With this
regard, the vertical distance of the grids with Si hole support, h1 (Figure 2g), changed from 0.5 to 9.5 mm, which lies in the extent
of the model window. We had three different parallel setups: the first
was with just one G850 above Si49 with zero offset and named as G850-Si49
(Figure 2g); the second
was with six G850 in series with D = 6 mm and named
as D6_G850-Si49; and the third with six G850 in series with D = 3 mm and named as D3_G850-Si49 (Figure 2h). Three-dimensional velocity field demonstrated
by streamlines obtained from 3D modeling shows significant differences
between the parallel setups having just one G850 and six G850 above
an Si49 outlet. The details of these differences will be discussed
in the next subsection. At this stage, we only mount two G850 in series
at D values, to keep the experiments simple and comparable
to the results from the models in 2D. In Section 2.2, we mount all six G850 as described in Figure 2h and perform measurements.
While permeation of the water flow remains high in parallel setups,
NaCl rejections are slightly improved with respect to individual supports.
Interestingly, the parallel setup with six G850 and D = 6 mm reaches around 38% when h1 =
4.5 mm. The velocity in parallel setups varies with h1, but all of the values lie between the velocity of individual
G850 and Si49.

A brief comparison between calculated streamlines
in 2D and 3D
models of the two main parallel setups with one and six G850 over
an Si49 (Figure 2g,h)
gives some indication of the differences in how the water flows from
the two setups and reaches the outlets. To gain more insight into
the underlying reasons for the improvements in the desalination parameters
in parallel supports, we will discuss the modeling results for bare
individual and bare parallel supports with two approaches: steady-state
and time-dependent. By evaluating the parameters that affect the desalination
performance in the next two subsections, we will demonstrate how we
envisaged these understandings into designing a setup with specific
water dynamics that will take advantage of the optimized geometrical
values for much better NaCl rejection than individual supports and
still high permeations.

2.1.2 Steady-State Modeling
Results
It
is known that during steady flow, the fluid properties can change
point to point within a geometry, but at any fixed point, they remain
constant. One of the main properties of a fluid is its velocity. From
the definition of incompressible fluid, the variation of volume with
time at both the inlet and outlet of the geometry, where the fluid
is flowing, should remain constant. This means that the velocity at
the inlet multiplied by the area of the inlet should be equal to the
velocity at the outlet multiplied by the area of the outlet. Since
the area of the inlet is much larger than the area of the outlet,
velocity increases vastly at the outlets.

Figure 3 compares 2D (x, z) velocity magnitude and velocity field of water for G300,
G400, G850, G1500, Si25, and Si49 as outlets at 103 Pa.
The inlet of all models is the entire 10 mm length at the top of the
window (where z = 10 mm). The velocity magnitude
has been demonstrated in two styles: surface (first column) and contour
(second column). Due to nonslip conditions at the nonporous walls
and from the surface representation, the velocity magnitude has a
minimum value of 0 alongside all of the vertical walls, attains higher
values near the pores in all outlets, and reaches its maximum value
inside the holes. Contour plots show curves of constant values and
reveal regions of high or low values of velocity magnitude with color
legend same as the surface. It is evident that the highest values
of velocity lie in the center of the outlets regardless of the length
of the outlet in all six membranes.

Figure 3 Two-dimensional (x, z) velocity
magnitude in surface (first column) and contour (second column) representation
and velocity field streamlines in uniform density style (third column)
and magnitude-controlled style (fourth column) of G300, G400, G850,
G1500, Si25, and Si49 at 103 Pa.

While quantitative study of fluid dynamics requires advanced
mathematics,
much can be learned from flow visualization. The velocity field is
demonstrated by streamlines (curves that are everywhere tangent to
the instantaneous direction of fluid velocity vector), indicating
the direction of fluid flow. Streamlines here have been demonstrated
in two styles: uniform density (third column) and magnitude-controlled
(fourth column). The first style was used to show an even distribution
of the flow in the entire geometry and also the small turbulence of
the flow produced in the bottom right-angled corners of the setup.
The dimension of this turbulent flow extends more in (x, z) for outlets that are smaller in length. The
second style demonstrates high- and low-density flows distributed
unevenly in the entire geometry of the setup; a large number of streamlines
are densely packed directly above the outlet and are much less dense
near vertical walls. For Si49, with smallest outlets, the streamlines
above the outlets are less dense in comparison to all other outlets.
Both styles show in common that at z = 5 mm and above,
the flow is completely laminar and for z = 0–5
mm, the streamlines converge into the outlets. It is evident that
the streamlines in the vicinity of outlets (in the fourth column)
are perpendicular to contours (in the second column) for identical
regions as expected by the definition of streamlines. We note that
the turbulence in a region forces the water to flow in cycles in that
region until all of the laminar flow nearby drains completely through
the outlets. As soon as the laminar flow volume is fully drained,
the volume of water from turbulent flow will start exiting the outlets.
A comparison between velocity field and magnitude in the region where
we have turbulence demonstrates that the velocity magnitude of turbulent
flow is lower than that of the laminar flow. The larger the volume
of the turbulence region, the larger the amount of water with lower
velocity. This slowing down of the flow in turbulence regions could
result in longer interaction of salty water with a surface that is
in contact with and can impact the particle rejection rate. However,
according to our models, the volume of water from turbulent flow is
usually much smaller than that from the laminar flow. Generally, some
percentage of the energy of the flow is lost in turbulence; therefore,
it is better to avoid these turbulent flows in optimizing design parameters.

The variation of velocity magnitude and field with increase in
pressure from 103 to 106 Pa for G850 as outlet
is demonstrated in Figure 4. A similar study is done for all other five outlets and presented
in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S5). The trend of variations is typically the same in all six types
of outlets, and therefore we only describe G850. The main difference
in streamlines of uniform density (Figure 4a) at different inlet pressures is the distribution
of the turbulent flow in the bottom corners of the setup. With increase
in pressure from 103 to 105 Pa, the turbulence
becomes smaller, and at 106 Pa, it becomes slightly larger
but being pushed up along the vertical walls. Streamline of magnitude-controlled
style (Figure 4b) shows
that increase in pressure increases the extent of laminar flow closer
down to outlets. Contour representation of the velocity magnitude
(Figure 4c) and the
respective magnified images show how the area of higher velocity (from
light blue to red) is hammered on the outlets as the pressure increases.
A comparison of maximum velocity value from the legend shows that
with linear increase in pressure, the maximum velocity (which is distributed
inside the outlets) increases linearly.

density style (second row); velocity magnitude in contour style (third
to fifth row) and in surface style (sixth row) of G850 as outlet at
103, 104, 105, and 106 Pa. The fourth row is a magnification of selected region in the
third row, and the fifth row is the magnification of selected region
in the fourth row.

Velocity field and velocity
magnitude behavior for G850-Si49 is
presented in Figure 5 at vertical distances h1 = 0.5, 1.5,
4.5, and 9.5 mm and at inlet pressure 103 Pa. Results of
similar comparison at other pressures for this geometry are depicted
in the Supporting Information (Figures S6 and S7). At a fixed pressure of 103 Pa and at different h1 values, magnitude-controlled streamlines show
no difference in the distribution of turbulent flow when approaching
G850 outlet (indicated in red triangles), but there is a significant
change in the size and distribution of the turbulent flow in the region
between G850 and Si49 (indicated in green dotted contours). At h1 = 0.5–4.5 mm, the turbulence grows
larger and fully fills the corners of the region between G850 and
Si49 with converging flow directly between the holes in G850 and Si49.
In h1 = 9.5 mm, the turbulence distribution
is only limited to the four corners of the region with a size similar
to turbulence highlighted in red triangles. As the inlet pressure
increases to 104 and 105 Pa, there are no apparent
changes in velocity field streamlines. When the inlet pressure is
106 Pa at all h1 values, turbulent
flows in the right-angled corners of the setup approaching G850 (indicated
in red triangles) become very small in comparison to 103 Pa (Figures S6 and S7). At h1 = 4.5, 9.5 mm, the turbulent flow in the region between
G850 and Si49 becomes denser and larger and widens the area of converging
flow between the holes of G850 and Si49 (Figure 5b). However, for h1 = 0.5, 1.5 mm, there is no significant difference in turbulent flow
in the region between G850 and Si49. At all h1 values and inlet pressures, uniform density streamlines are
closely packed and have very high density in the vicinity of G850
and Si49 holes. As h1 increases, the very
dense streamlines get separated by the vertical distance between G850
holes and Si49 outlet. The turbulent flow (with 300 levels) is usually
not apparent in magnitude-controlled style for other geometries, but
it can be seen at some h1 values in this
particular geometry. Velocity magnitude in contour style is in agreement
with velocity field uniform density style. Magnified images of the
contours near the outlets show less curvature for h1 = 0.5 mm but negligible differences at other h1 values (Figure 5). With the increase of inlet pressure, the values
of maximum velocities inside outlet holes increase linearly with increase
in pressure (Figure 7b). When the grids are in series together and in parallel with Si49,
D6_G850-Si49, a major difference with the single-grid case is the
vanishing of turbulent flow almost everywhere in the magnitude-controlled
style streamlines (Figure 6a, first row). In this geometry, the flow is directed to the
grids that are spaced with D = 6 mm and are very
close to the vertical walls. In D6_G850-Si49, the flow is directed
from G850s and at h1 = 0.5, 1.5 mm, it
almost reaches the outlet in Si49 horizontally, and therefore, minor
turbulence forms (indicated in green contours). At h1 = 4.5 mm, the flow between G850s and Si49 is not horizontal
but it converges from G850s to Si49 with almost no turbulent flow.
At h1 = 9.5 mm, turbulence flow similar
to G850-Si49 forms in the bottom corners of the setup. The above description
holds for all inlet pressures with an exception. At 106 Pa and h1 = 4.5, 9.5 mm, turbulent flow
forms directly beneath the G850–G850 region (Figure 6b), while no turbulence is
present in this area at lower pressures (Figure 6a).

The streamlines in uniform density style are closely packed
in
the holes of G850s and Si49 (Figure 6a, second row). However, there is an evident horizontal
dense streamline region between the grids and Si49 when h1 is small (e.g., h1 = 0.5,
1.5 mm). This region is of interest for the experimental measurements
where the water flow is in close and probably longer contact with
the surface of Si49. The velocity magnitude presented by contours
in the third row shows the same aspects of the flow as in the uniform
density streamlines. At h1 = 0.5 mm, the
curvature of the contours in the vicinity of the outlet is very different
from that at higher h1 values. A full
comparison of velocity magnitude in contour style and velocity field
streamlines in magnitude-controlled style and uniform density style
of D6_G850-Si49 at 104 and 106 Pa is presented
in Figures S8 and S9 where h1 = 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, and 9.5 mm. With the increase of inlet
pressure, the values of maximum velocities inside outlet holes increase
linearly with the increase in pressure (Figure 7b). Similar calculations
were performed on D3_G850-Si49 at 104–106 Pa (Figures S10–S12) and Ext_G850-Si49
at 103–106 Pa (Figures S13–S15) both at h1 = 0.5,
1.5, 4.5, and 9.5 mm. D3_G850-Si49 is very similar to D6_G850-Si49,
but the spacing between series G850s is 3 mm and each G850 has a distance
of 2.5 mm from the vertical walls, which causes a larger distribution
of turbulent flow. Ext_G850-Si49 geometry is similar to G850-Si49,
but the holes of G850 extend across the 10 mm length. We do not have
an experimental analogy to this geometry, but it was essential to
see the effects of extended holes on the velocity field and magnitude
at least in the models.

The maximum velocity
of all of the different geometries modeled
in this section is plotted in Figure 7.

contour style where the maximum refers to the center of the main outlet
hole. For parallel supports, the outlet holes in all cases correspond
to Si49. The maximum value of velocity is slightly larger than the
average velocity from experimental data, but the trend of their variation
is very similar. For most individual porous supports, the maximum
velocity increases almost an order of magnitude with the stepwise
increase of inlet pressure from 103 to 106 Pa.
However, for the supports with the largest holes (e.g., G300 and G400),
this increase is less than an order of magnitude (Figure 7a). For all parallel geometries,
the increase of maximum velocity with pressure is linear (Figure 7b). Considering the
effect of the vertical distance between G850s and Si49, h1, there are some minor variations in the maximum velocity
of different parallel supports at each inlet pressure (Figure 7c). The pattern of these variations
for every parallel support is barely changed with the increase in
inlet pressure. h1 = 1.5 mm seems to be
a characteristic vertical distance since at most of the inlet pressures,
it has maximum velocity values. We will later see that optimum velocity
is not the only parameter that is critical for better performance
of the membranes. Particle trajectory (in the models) and particle
rejection (in the experiments) are other important parameters that
need to be optimum when engineering the dynamics of water-containing
particles across porous membranes.

2.1.3 Time-Dependent
Modeling Results
In the previous section, the effect of geometry
was examined on the
velocity field and magnitude of pure water flow and some optimum values
were obtained in parallel porous supports. Once the water is not pure
and contains particles, it is important to understand how these particles
find their way from the inlet to the outlets of the porous supports
and how do inlet pressure, size of the pores, and vertical distances
of the supports in parallel setups impact their transport time and
pathways. For this reason, we performed particle trajectory on a limited
number of particles in optimal geometries from the previous section.
The number of the particles in all geometries was 300, and the diameter
of the particles was 1 μm. Since an extremely fine physics-controlled
mesh was used with a minimum element size of 0.24 μm, this diameter
was reasonable. Although the diameter of the salt ions and the dyes
in our experiments were several times smaller than the finest pores
in the outlet membranes, the diameter of the particles in the model
was only 7 times smaller than the finest pore size in the porous supports,
which was inevitable due to the minimum element size in the mesh.
The choice of the number of particles was based on test runs and was
reasonable because it was enough to follow the trace of the particles.
Furthermore, the calculation time for each geometry was not too long
with this number. As described in Simulation Model
and Method, we modeled another set of porous supports with
three parallel membranes, where an outlet O is in parallel with G850-Si49,
D6_G850_Si49, and D3_G850-Si49. We summarized the velocity field and
magnitude results obtained from the steady-state models for these
new geometries and particle trajectory results for better comparison.
To keep the calculations simple, we selected a single hole with diameter d ranging from 5 μm to 1 mm with a varied vertical
distance h2 from Si49. For h1 = 1.5 mm, h2 was taken as
0.5, 1, 1.5, 4.5, and 9.5 mm, and for h2 = 1.5, h1 was taken as 0.5, 1.5, 4.5,
and 9.5 mm. The inlet pressure was varied from 103 to 106 Pa for minimum values of h1, h2, and d. Particle trajectory
was studied with time variation where a timeline was produced as the
result. A timeline is a set of adjacent fluid particles that are marked
at the same (earlier) instant in time. Because of friction at the
vertical walls and the no-slip condition, the fluid velocity there
is zero. Hence, the left and right of the timeline are anchored at
their starting locations. In regions of flow away from the walls,
the marked fluid particles move at the local fluid velocity, deforming
the timeline. For all calculations, velocity field (mainly with uniform
density style and some with magnitude-controlled style) obtained by
steady-state calculations was superimposed over the particle trajectory
at each snapshot of the timeline to distinguish the difference between
water streamlines and particle pathlines. The full timeline of each
calculation contained too much data; therefore, it was impossible
to show all of the timelines. We chose main snapshots of the timelines,
and in specific cases, a video of the full timeline is presented in
the Supporting Information. However, the
full result of the timeline for each calculation is given in a graph
demonstrating the variation of total number of particles with time
evolution. For simplicity and reducing calculation time, we modeled
particle trajectory on G850-Si49-O and examined the effect of various
parameters, and from the obtained results, we performed further calculations
with optimum parameters on D6_G850-Si49-O and D3_G850-Si49-O.

The first column in Figure 8 shows velocity magnitude (in contour style) for G850-Si49
mounted over the third outlet with diameter d (5,
10, 20, 50, 500 μm) and at vertical distance h2 = 1 mm with h1 = 1.5 mm
and at 103 Pa. As d increases, the contours
become denser around G850, Si49, and the final outlet O, which is
depicted clearly in the magnified inset image. The pathlines of the
particles in the second and third columns are shown for T = 0 and 60 s superimposed on velocity field streamlines. At T = 0 s, the spectrum of particles at the top of the inlet
demonstrates variation in initial velocity depending on the location
of the particles. The legend of the figure shows the velocity magnitude
of particles. With the increase in time, the velocity of the particles
increases and therefore the particles gain acceleration. The time
at which the particles reach the first holes (in G850) is dependent
on the diameter of the final outlet O. It takes 53 s for the particles
in the geometry with d = 5 μm to reach G850,
and at 60 s, about 75 particles out of 300 reach the final outlet
(fourth column). A more detailed timeline for d =
5 μm is presented in Figure S16,
Supporting Information. This figure compares time evolution of the
particles in long enough time, where they reach stability and their
pathline almost fits the velocity field streamline. Velocity field
streamlines are represented in two styles, magnitude-controlled and
uniform density. From a detailed study on the particles time evolution,
it is clear that the particles do not fall into the turbulent flow.
For d = 500 μm, it takes only 2 s for the particles
to reach G850 and about 260 of them reach the final outlet at 60 s.
This is also reflected in velocity field streamlines where at larger d values, the streamlines are much denser even at the inlet
compared to streamlines in smaller d values. It is
clear that the pathlines for the particles deviate from the streamline
of water in all geometries until a stable situation is reached in
the time-dependent picture (see Figure S16). For instance, when d = 10 μm and for T ≥ 18 s, a stability is reached and the pathlines
from unsteady-state modeling almost fit the streamlines from steady-state
modeling. When inlet pressure increases from 103 to 106 Pa with d = 5 μm, h1 = 1.5 mm, and h2 = 1 mm,
the main impact on time evolution of the particles is the significant
drop of onset time of particles in reaching G850 and the slight increase
in the number of particles that reach the final outlet at 60 s. For
the inlet pressure of 106 Pa, it only takes 0.2 s for the
particles to reach G850 and by 60 s, almost 200 of them reach the
final outlet. Details are presented in Figure S17, Supporting Information. For d = 5 μm
and h1 = 1.5 mm, at 103 Pa
and h2 = 0.5, 1.5 mm, the onset of reaching
G850 are 52 and 53 s, respectively, but for h2 = 4.5, 9.5 mm, the onset does not fall in the 0–60
s range, and therefore an extra 30 s was added to the calculations
(Figure S18). When h2 is fixed at 1.5 mm and h1 = 0.5,
1.5, 4.5, and 9.5 mm, the onset remains in the 0–60 s range
(Figure S19). The most characteristic variations
for h1 and h2 are presented briefly in Figure 9. A minimum number of particles (∼10) reach
final outlet at 60 s when h1 = 9.5 mm
and h2 = 1.5 mm.

and timeline (second and third columns) in a G850-Si49-O system where
the length of the hole varies from 0.005 to 1 mm at 103 Pa. Variation of the total number of particles with time (fourth
column) shows the onset of the time where particles reach G850 and
the number of particles that reach O at 60 s.

system where d = 0.005 mm for different h1 and h2 values at 103 Pa. Corresponding particle trajectory (pathline) and timeline
(second to fifth row).

In parallel supports, when a G850 is added in series with
separation D to the other G850, the particle trajectory
becomes more
interesting. Figure 10 compares the time evolution of particles passing through three geometries:
G850/Si49/O, D6_G850-Si49/O, and D3_G850-Si49/O. In the 0–90
s range, it takes 84 s for the particles in D6_G850-Si49/O to reach
G850s, while less than 40 particles manage to reach the final outlet
at 90 s. In D3_G850-Si49/O, the onset of reaching G850s is 74 s and
almost 130 particles reach the final outlet at 90 s. The timeline
comparison clearly shows that when G850 is directly above Si49, the
particles have the shortest path to travel to reach the final outlet.
But when there are two G850 separated by D, the particles
travel a longer path. When the separation D is 6
mm, this path is the longest. This is briefly demonstrated in Figure 11e, where the time
range was 0–90 s. Figure 11 summarizes the results on particle trajectory and
maximum velocity modeling in different geometries and for variations
in d, h1, h2, and inlet pressure. The number depicted (per second)
against the second y data is the onset time when
particles reach G850.

geometries. (a) d variation in G850-Si49-O, (b) P variation in G850-Si49-O, (c) h1 variation in G850-Si49-O, (d) h2 variation

D6_G850-Si49, O (final outlet with d = 0.005 mm),
and D6_G850-Si49-O.

All of the data presented
here are discrete and the dotted lines
only connect the data to show the trend of changes. The general result
from data analysis in Figure 11a–e shows an increase in maximum velocity with decrease
in the onset time of particles reaching G850 and increase in the maximum
number of particles that reach the final outlet in any particular
time range and vice versa. Figure 11f compares maximum velocity and maximum number of particles
reaching the final outlet between six different geometries. This comparison
highlights the advantages of using parallel porous supports over individual
ones in optimizing the membrane performances. When two G850 are put
in parallel with Si49 and a single outlet O, the number of particles
that reach the final outlet is 38 at 90 s. At high enough times (t ≥ 300 s), this number increases to 76 and stabilizes.
This is the lowest number of particles reaching the final outlet compared
to other geometries. The ratio of this number over 300 subtracted
from 1 gives a value that can be a measure of particle rejection in
the parallel geometry. This means that particles with smaller diameter
than the membrane holes can be rejected through other mechanisms than
size rejection. While this rejection is negligible in individual porous
supports or even parallel supports without O, it is quite substantial
in parallel supports with O.

Furthermore, the particles reach
G850s at 84 s and the maximum
velocity inside the final outlet O is 6.2 × 10–3 m/s in D6_G850-Si49-O. In any given time range, the longer it takes
for the particles to reach G850, the lower the acceleration of the
particles. From Newtonian mechanics, acceleration of a particle has
a direct relationship with the path it has traveled and an inverse
relationship with the square of the time its travel has taken. With
the optimum values found for h1, h2, d, P, and
also the more ideal geometries in the models, the possibilities of
our experimental setup in the next section narrow down to a few cases.
We only use the results of the models and the trends in parameter
variations to elevate our experimental results, and due to the differences
in particle diameters, we will not attempt to compare the exact particle
rejections from the models to particle rejections from experiments.

2.2 Individual and Parallel CNT/Supports for Desalination
From the results of Section 2.1.1 and the results from the modeling, we can draw some
lines: bare individual supports have very low salt rejections and
bare parallel supports without O have improved but still low rejection
rates. However, parallel supports with very small O demonstrate candidates
with well improved salt rejection, but they are not all quite the
same. For a geometry where G850 is directly above Si49, lower acceleration
of the particles due to the presence of very small O has some improvement
in particle rejection. In geometries with two G850 in series being
farthest apart, we expect higher improvement because the acceleration
of the particles decreases more as they reach G850 and the particles
eventually flow to the final outlet O. On the other hand, in the region
between G850s and Si49, and for small h1 values, the flow is horizontal and almost laminar. Hence, we expect
the particles to have more interaction with the surface of Si49 especially
away from its holes. We will see in Section 2.2.2 that salt rejection in the geometries
with horizontal flow improves quite significantly.

It is shown
that some types of CNTs can reject salt ions such as NaCl and MgSO4 to an extent using their surface properties27 rather than size rejection through the inner diameter of
the tubes.23,24 Among them, spaghetti CNT had
better performance. In the next subsection, we use CNTs to enhance
the surface properties of the membranes along with decreased particle
acceleration and horizontal flow to vastly improve salt rejection
while retaining water permeation higher than the state-of-the-art
desalination membranes.

2.2.1 CNT Growth and Characterization
on Porous
Supports
Spaghetti CNT was grown on all porous supports mentioned
in Section 4.2. We
followed a similar protocol for the growth of CNTs to that in ref (46), where a tip-growth mechanism
was proposed. Therein, (110) planes of the nickel were catalytically
active surfaces during the growth. Mechanisms of CNT growth have been
discussed by Chhowalla et al.,47 where
both tip and root growth conditions are possible, depending on the
adhesion of the seed layer to the substrate. As observed in the magnified
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images, the Ni
seed has been lifted upward during the growth of the CNTs and positioned
at the top of each tube, confirming a tip-growth mechanism. While
the growth process on Si supports was very reproducible, it was not
very successful on the grids. Some of the successful growths on G850
and on G1500 are shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12 (a) FESEM images of spaghetti grown on G850, G1500, Si25,
and Si49.
(b) Experimental mounting of G850 over CNT/Si49 and in parallel with
a third outlet O for water measurements. (c) Schematic image of spaghetti
CNTs grown on Si49 showing the length and density of the CNTs. (d)
Raman spectrum of CNT/Si supports representing D, G, and G′
peaks, which are signatures of CNT formation.

Thin nickel grids with thickness ≤30 μm tended
to
curve beyond 600 °C, where the required temperature for the growth
of spaghetti CNT was above 650 °C. It was very hard to mount
bended grids over tiny holes in Plexiglas and avoid water leakage
from the sides. CNT/microporous Si supports (Si25 and Si49) were either
taken further for water measurements individually or used in parallel
with bare G850 and O supports (Figure 12b). Raman spectroscopy (Figure 12d) demonstrates the formation
of CNTs. D-band (1348 cm–1), G-band (1594 cm–1), and G′-band (2697 cm–1) confirm the typical characteristics of multiwall carbon nanotubes.48 Raman scattering is highly sensitive to the
electronic structure and is an essential tool to characterize carbonaceous
materials. The G-band corresponds to the tangential stretching mode
of an ordered graphite structure with sp2 hybridization
and the D-band relates to the disorder-induced phonon mode due to
finite-size crystals and defects.49 G′-band
is an important band in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which gives information
about the degree of nanotube crystallinity.50

The sharp G′-band in Figure 12d suggests metallic nanotubes rather than
semiconducting ones. The ratio of D to G band intensities (ID/IG) is known to
associate with the in-plane crystal domain size and has been used
to estimate the degree of disorder in graphitic carbon.51 While an ID/IG ratio near zero indicates high crystallinity
(order), a ratio close to or greater than 1 demonstrates high disorder
due to abundant defects in the graphitic structure; ID/IG = 0.791 in Figure 12d suggests somewhat
defective surface or disorder of the grown CNTs.

As mentioned,
Ni remained at the end of the tips of the tubes.
The remaining Ni at the tip of the tubes (and mainly inside the tubes)
has a minor chance to escape from the rigid crystalline structure
of the CNTs and flow across the apertures of the membrane into the
permeate solution and contaminate the solution. For large-scale fabrication
of CNT membranes, removing Ni may be an issue to avoid water contamination
and health hazards if the membranes are to be used for water desalination.
To remove the Ni from the end of the tubes, there is a protocol that
can be followed.27

2.2.2 NaCl and Dye Rejection and Water Permeation
Figure 13a compares
NaCl rejection and water permeation in porous supports with grown
spaghetti CNT. The rejection rates for the grids with CNT improves
slightly with respect to their rejection without CNT (in Figure 2c). For all of the
rejection measurements in this section, we used the pressure of 103 Pa, due to optimizations in the models and a constant permeate
solution of 20 cc. The rejection rate in G850-CNT/Si49-O has been
significantly improved with respect to G850-Si49-O due to the presence
of CNT. The permeations in samples with final smaller outlets are
higher. Permeation as described by relation 2 has an inverse relation with the area of
the outlet and the time it takes for a certain volume of water to
pass the outlet. When the area of the outlet is small, it takes more
time for the flow to pass through, which overall results in high permeation.
In a comparison with ultrafiltration membranes, the values we obtained
for water permeation were a few orders of magnitude higher. One main
reason is that our experimental applied pressures were about 3 orders
of magnitude lower than the applied pressure on ultrafiltration membranes
and permeation has an inverse relation with pressure. Also, the permeation
values
reported for ultrafiltration membranes is related to large area samples
that fit into industrial plants but the overall area for our samples
here are orders of magnitude smaller.

Figure 13 (a, b) NaCl rejection
and water permeation in various individual,
parallel, and CNT-covered porous supports. (c) SEM image of a typical
O outlet, with d ∼ 0.005 mm fabricated on
SiN/Si/SiN membrane. The topmost circle layer is the thin nitride
remained from the physical etching process. (d) Dye rejection (Allura
red and Indigo) for three parallel supports. (e, f) UV–vis
absorbance spectra of 0.1–1 mM Allura red and Indigo dyes.

D6-G850-Si49-O (Figure 13b) shows better NaCl rejection
with respect to G850-Si49-O,
which demonstrates the effectiveness of having two G850s spaced as
far as possible rather than having just one G850 directly above Si49.
The horizontal flow that forms between G850s and Si49 and the decrease
in particle acceleration are the underlying reasons for this improvement.
Strikingly, D6-G850-CNT/Si49-O (Figure 13b) shows much better NaCl rejection with
respect to G850-CNT/Si49-O, where both Si49 are covered with CNT.
In the former, the horizontal flow of water and the particles directly
above CNTs and the decrease in particle acceleration in this region
play an important role. Experimental sample D6-G850-CNT/Si49-O had
two G850s equivalent to the models. But to take advantage of the whole
surface area of CNT/Si49, we used six G850s (as described in Figure 1) in a symmetric
manner and we name it 3D6-G850-CNT/Si49-O. This allowed water and
salt flow to reach all of the surface area of CNT before draining
out of Si49 holes. NaCl rejection in this sample reached almost 90%,
which is amazingly high. Using a smart configuration of parallel supports
with effective distances at low pressure, microporous membranes covered
with spaghetti CNT managed to reject ions of nanometer scale; 1 mM
Allura red and Indigo dyes were also passed through the three samples
with highest NaCl rejections to measure the effectiveness of their
filtration further. UV–vis spectra were taken on 0.1–1
mM dyes, as shown in Figure 13e,f. The permeate solution of the dyes was compared to the
calibration spectra, and the rejection was calculated (Figure 13d). The rejection of Allura
red was higher than Indigo in all three samples, since Allura red
is a longer chain of atoms and also has a double molecular mass than
the Indigo. In the measurements involving CNTs, the error was slightly
higher than that without CNT. This could be related to the random
distribution of the tubes in different directions.

2.3 Effect of Wettability and Porosimetry on Desalination
Performance
Wetting is the process of water interacting with
a surface, and wettability studies usually implicate the measurement
of contact angles. The contact angle of a liquid drop on an ideal
solid surface is defined by the mechanical equilibrium of the drop
under the action of three interfacial tensions: liquid–vapor,
solid–vapor, and solid–liquid interfacial tensions,
described first by Thomas Young.52,53 The contact
angle is geometrically obtained by applying a tangent line from the
contact point along the liquid–vapor interface in the droplet
profile. Usually a small contact angle is observed when the liquid
spreads on the surface, while a large contact angle is observed when
the liquid beads on the surface and forms a compact liquid droplet.
The most widely used technique of contact angle measurement is a direct
measurement of the tangent angle at the three-phase contact point
on a sessile drop profile.54 Here, the
wettability was evaluated using dynamic water contact angle tests
on the CNT/SiN and CNT/Si49 surfaces (Figure S21). Since the substrates were relatively large, contact angles were
measured at multiple points and an average value, representative of
the entire surface, was recorded. As the water dropped onto the CNT/SiN
surface, the contact angle declined slowly with time from 134.75 to
121° in 210 s while the values suggest a hydrophobic nature when
there is no pore on the surface and gravity is the only external force.
The contact angle on CNT/Si49 had values below 90°, suggesting
a hydrophilic nature with the pores sucking the water through themselves.
When a drop of 0.1 M NaCl was released on the same surface, the initial
contact angle was lower than the initial contact angle with pure water
and it declined faster with time (Figure 14e).

Figure 14 (a, b) Two-dimensional (x, z)
velocity magnitude in surface for G850 and one of the holes in G850-Si49
at different pressures. As the pressure increases, the flow of high
velocity water gets suppressed. (c) Dynamic water contact angle measurement
with time for CNT/SiN and CNT/Si49. (d) Contact angle vs pore diameter
considering the surface tension of water and CNTs at 104 Pa. (e) Pore diameter vs contact angle variations at different pressures.

It was not straightforward to
assess the contact angle of water
in the pressure-driven setup we used for water permeation and salt
rejection measurements. From the literature,55 at high contact angles, very high pressures are required to allow
water to pass through pores. The simulations on various porous supports
under applied pressure presented in Section 2.1.2 showed that with increase in pressure,
the velocity of the water flow increased linearly, and as a result,
water permeation increased with the same trend. Although it is not
possible to give quantitative values for water contact angle, the
simulations provide some insight into the effect of pressure on the
wettability of the surface. Figure 14a shows the velocity magnitude variation of G850 with
pressure. The suppression of high velocity water onto the hole area
is evident as the pressure increases (comparing the vertical distance
of the horizontal dashed line with the top of the high velocity area).
At the lowest pressure (103 Pa), on the edges of the hole
cross section, velocity makes angle Ψ < π/2 (depicted
with red arrows) with the horizontal hole cross section. It suggests
that water only goes through the holes if it is directly above the
holes, and at all other regions, velocity has almost zero value. At
higher pressures, velocity attains tangent components with Ψ
> π/2 and nonzero velocity is extended beyond the edges of
the
hole cross section. Note that Ψ should not be confused with
θ, whereas the former corresponds to velocity and the latter
to the topography of water. The suppression of high-velocity water
above holes cross section at higher pressures in Figure 14b is less significant but
still present. In this figure, the depicted hole is the central hole
of Si49 in the G850-Si49 structure. It is clear that pore size and
density have a direct impact on wettability of the surface. These
analyses on the velocity variation of water flow with pressure across
a given bare porous support can be applied to a CNT-covered surface.
With CNT on top, surface tension of a porous support is nonzero relative
to a bare porous support, but its magnitude does not change with the
increase in inlet pressure. Therefore, the inlet pressure still works
against the surface tension and increases the wettability at elevated
pressures. For the desalination purposes, higher wettability helps
in the increase in water permeation, but it may not be favorable to
salt rejection since water permeation and salt rejection always have
a trade-off. However, our results show that it is possible to engineer
the measurement setup to take advantage of the low hydrophilicity
of CNT-covered supports to improve salt rejection and keep water permeation
high enough for efficient desalination.

To investigate how contact
angle and pore diameter relate, we used
the following relation 3  where P is the liquid pressure,
γ is the surface tension, θ is the contact angle, and D is the pore diameter. Since all our samples were either
microfabricated or commercially purchased, the geometry and size of
the pores were determined and checked with FESEM. The minimum diameter
of the pores in the samples was 5 μm (Table 1). When Si49 was covered with CNT, the diameter
of the holes decreased by 10–15% according to FESEM image analyses,
which can, in principle, increase the contact angle by a small amount.
From the literature, the surface tension between water and multiwall
CNTs is about 72 mN/m.56,57 We calculated the contact angle
of a porous surface at 104 Pa and at different pore diameters
by substituting these values into (relation 3). Figure 14d shows the variation of contact angle with pore diameter.
As the pore diameter increases from 0 to 15 μm, the contact
angle decreases linearly from 90 to 58°, but beyond this point,
it drops exponentially to 0° for pore diameter 28.8 μm.
At 103 Pa, the contact angle starts with 90° for zero
pore diameter but decreases much faster with increase in pore diameter.
At this low pressure, a pore must be 288 μm wide to have zero
contact angle. For higher pressures of 105 and 106 Pa, the maximum value of pore diameter must be 2.88 μm and
288 nm, respectively, to have zero contact angle. Overall, at all
pressures, hydrophilicity increases with the increase in pore diameter,
but the rate of the increase is higher at higher pressures.

2.4 Generic Applications and Future Perspective
The sizes
of the different elements in the models proposed in this
work are not limited to the current values, they can be larger and
even smaller. The trend of variations in the parameters is also extendable
to other scales. For example, the overall scale of the model G850-Si49-O
with h1 = h2 = 1.5 mm, d = 0.005 mm, and P =
103 Pa was reduced to 1:10 and another time to 1:100 (Figure S20 in the Supporting Information). There
was almost no change in the particle trajectory and timeline when
the scales were lowered. We did not look into scale 1:1000 since the
size of the elements would drop to nanometer, and in this range, the
governing equations describing the physics of the system would presumably
change. To have a sense of the size of the model elements in these
reduced scales, let us consider scale 1:100. In this scale, the vertical
and horizontal size of the model reduces from 10 mm to 100 μm,
the typical size of the outlets reduces from 5–7 μm to
50–70 nm, the typical vertical distances between the parallel
supports reduce from 1.5 mm to 15 μm, the horizontal distance
between supports reduces from 6 mm to 60 μm, and the diameter
of the particles reduces from 1 μm to 10 nm. These values are
typical in microfiltration and nanofiltration processes.

We
could not model the CNTs directly in the current scale of this work,
due to the minimum element size of the mesh. The overall size of the
setup was important in this work and we did not want to eliminate
the effects caused by millimeter scale. Now that we have learned those
aspects, as part of future work, we can zoom in to the area where
parallel supports provide horizontal flow and include the CNTs to
directly see the effect of their presence on particle trajectory.
We could also charge the particles and the CNTs by applying an electric
field and study the interaction of CNTs with the particles and the
modified particle trajectory. There are so many other aspects that
can be part of the future work such as the variation of the number
of particles and the shape and orientation of the tubes if the scale
of the measurement is lowered.

Polymer-based desalination membranes
and the entire plant that
holds the membranes along with all other parts that allow RO processes
have long been studied and optimized. Now using a new generation of
porous membranes requires optimization at all levels. Engineering
the measurement setup including parallel porous supports decorated
with carbon-based materials in a smart way to increase particle rejection
and maintain high permeation is a must in widening the future perspective
for water desalination.

3 Conclusions
Motivated
by the potential of unprocessed CNTs in water desalination
through their surface area, we aimed to increase the efficiency of
these materials by developing an engineered measurement setup with
optimized design parameters such as inlet pressure, outlet length,
and vertical and horizontal distances between the membranes. Using
a set of microporous supports in parallel and series, we took the
uttermost advantage of the surface area of CNTs to enhance salt rejection
and maintain water permeation at high levels. In the most optimized
configuration, almost 90% NaCl rejection was obtained while the lengths
of the outlets were at submicron level. For larger particles such
as Allura red, almost 97% rejection was obtained. Water permeation
values for all configurations were much higher than polymer-based
desalination membranes.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Preparation of Holes in Si3N4/Si/Si3N4 Substrates
A combination
of wet and dry etching processes was carried out on single-side-polished
Si3N4/Si/Si3N4 wafers
10 mm × 10 mm × 500 μm, with the nitride layer as
a hard mask, following the protocol in ref (5). Two sets of array patterns were produced, one
with 5 × 5 array consisting of 25 holes and the other with 7
× 7 array consisting of 49 holes, denoted as Si25 and Si49 hereafter,
respectively. The lengths of the holes in Si25 and Si49 were 30 and
7 μm, respectively. The distance between hole centers in Si25
was 400 μm, and in Si49, it was 50 μm. Using the same
protocol, another array was produced with 5 μm hole length and
400 μm distance between hole centers. All of the holes were
blocked using photoresist apart from the middle hole before physical
etching in reactive ion etcher. This membrane with only one hole is
named O, hereafter.

4.2 CNT Synthesis and Characterization
Patterned Si25 and Si49 were transferred in physical vapor deposition
system, and 20 nm Ni was deposited on the polished patterned side.
These samples and commercial bare Ni grids with hole lengths of 70,
45, 20, and 10.5 μm (named as G300, G400, G850, and G1500 hereafter,
respectively) were then taken into a homemade direct-current plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition system for the growth of CNTs. With hydrogen
gas flow, 30 s hydrogen plasma, acetylene gas was injected into the
chamber to initialize CNT formation. Meanwhile, the hydrogen flow
and temperature remained at 100 sccm and 700 °C, respectively.

4.3 Experimental Setup for Salty Water Filtration
Using various flat and cylinder-shaped Plexiglas, epoxies, stainless
steel screws, washers and threads, volume expanders, and their tubing
kit including a valve and connecting rubber tubing, we designed a
simple pressure-driven setup for measurement of water transport and
salt rejection of bare grids, Si supports, and CNT-covered samples.
For all measurements, the source and tubing (with height H1) was initially full of feed solution with the valve
closed, and with the start of measurements, the valve was half-way
opened. The density (ρ) of the feed solution, 10–2 M NaCl, is roughly 1000.2 kg/m3 at room temperature.
Since salt concentration in brackish water is 500–3000 ppm
and in moderate saline water, it is 3000–10 000 ppm,
our feed concentrations stand at a higher range of brackish water
definition.58 Permeate solutions were collected
in small beakers for salt rejection measurements.

4.4 Electrical Conductivity (EC) and UV–Vis
Measurements
Electrical conductivities (ECs) of feed and
permeate solutions were measured by a portable multirange EC meter
(HANNA Instruments HI8733, Romania). The probe of the instrument was
held firmly in beakers containing certain volume of feed/permeate
solutions until conductivity values were stable and recorded. The
conductivity of 10–2 M NaCl solution was 1240 μS/cm.
Salt rejection rate (%) was measured as . Each measurement was conducted
three times
and the resulting rejection rates were averages of the three measurements
to reduce the reading/sampling errors. After each measurement, the
sample surfaces were washed thoroughly with deionized (DI) water.
Red (Allura) and blue (Indigo) dyes with molar masses of 496.42 and
262.27 g/mol, respectively, were also used as feed solution in an
identical setup described in previous section. A 1 mM solution of
each dye was prepared in distilled water. UV–vis absorbance
spectra (using Avantes, λ = 200–800 nm) of the two dyes
were taken as feed solutions. After passing through the membranes,
similar measurement was carried out on permeate solutions. The difference
in absorbance of the two (feed and permeate solutions) was considered
as a tool to measure the rejection rate of the dyes.

4.5 Water Contact Angle Measurements
Dynamic water contact
angle measurements were done on bare SiN surfaces
and CNT/SiN surfaces once with DI water droplet and again with 10–1 M NaCl solution. The contact angle was measured with
time variation using the sessile drop method by IRASOL (CA-500A) instrument
equipped with a digital camera.

5 Simulation
Model and Method
5.1 Steady-State Modeling
Navier–Stokes
was the governing equation for steady-state and incompressible flow
using COMSOL in Cartesian coordinate system45 4   5  where ρ
is the density of the fluid
(kg/m3), u = (ux, uy, uz) is the velocity
vector (m/s), P is the pressure (Pa), F is the volume force vector (N/m3) representing
external force, μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and T is the absolute temperature (K). Here, the density of
the fluid was 1000 kg/m3, the dynamic viscosity of the
fluid was 0.001 Pa s, and there was no external force. The boundary
conditions in the inlet were: laminar inflow with four different entrance
pressures, 103, 104, 105, and 106 Pa, and no-slip boundary condition in walls. In all 2D models, u = (ux, uz) and extremely fine physics-controlled mesh
was used with maximum element size of 8.04 × 10–2 mm and minimum element size of 2.4 × 10–4 mm. The geometry of the model was considered according to the geometry
of the experimental setup. The inlet of the flow was an opening of
10 mm width (in all models) and the height of the fluid was also considered
as 10 mm. Although the maximum height in the experimental setup was
103 mm, fluid mechanics and our test runs disclose that
the flow is laminar and the velocity field and magnitude are constant
along the tube, well above the outlets. When the height of the fluid
was <5 mm, in the vicinity of the outlets, the geometry of the
setup starts to change and results in significant variations in the
velocity. The lengths of the holes in individual porous supports Si25,
Si49, G300, G400, G850, and G1500 were initially used as the outlet
of the fluid. Then, in parallel supports, the outlet was the holes
of Si49, with G300 in a parallel plane but directly on top (with offset
0) at different heights h1 = 0.5, 1.5,
4.5, and 9.5 mm. In another geometry, two G850s were situated in series
at two different spacings (D = 3, 6 mm) in parallel
with Si49, at all mentioned h1 heights.
In this section, a hole-bar line akin to G850 but extended across
10 mm length was modeled above and in parallel with Si49 at all h1 values. This geometry did not have an equivalent
experimental setup. Finally, three parallel supports were used, G850,
Si49, and O, while the outlet was just O. The velocity of the flow
through all membranes was studied from the solutions represented by
surface and contours for velocity magnitude (with magnitude-controlled
level: 300) and by streamlines for velocity field (with uniform density
of 0.02 mm and magnitude-controlled level: 300).

5.2 Time-Dependent Modeling
In addition
to the steady-state solutions for the fluid for various porous supports
and at different pressures, the time evolution of trajectory of the
particles in the fluid was determined for various geometries and pressures.
For particle trajectory modeling, the Newtonian formulation was used 6  where mP is the
particle mass (kg) and Ft is the force (N) exerted on the particle in time t. The particle density was 2160 kg/m3, and its
diameter was 1 μm with 0 charge number. The initial position
of the particles was set at the inlet with the number of particles
per release equal to 300 based on some pretests.

The initial
particle’s velocity was considered as the fluid velocity field,
which was determined by the steady-state modeling. For determining
the motion of the particles in the fluid, drag force was used with
the Stokes drag law45 7  where mP is the
particle mass (kg), τP is the particle velocity response
time (s), v is the velocity of the particle (m/s),
and u is the fluid velocity (m/s). The drag force
in 2D models have FD(x) and FD(z) components
with (ux–
vx) and (uz – vz) parts. The particle velocity response time for
spherical particles in a laminar flow is defined as 8  where μ is the fluid
viscosity (Pa s),
ρP is the particle density (kg/m3), and dP is the particle diameter (m). The geometries
used for outlets in this section were optimized geometries from the
steady-state results. Since the variation of velocity in-plane (x, y) were small relative to the variation
in vertical direction (z), direction y was ignored with negligible error. The flow was modeled conveniently
being two-dimensional (2D) since the average velocities obtained from
modeling were very close to the related velocities in experimental
measurements (with ±0.5% error). Three-dimensional modeling was
also tested in some cases, but the results are not presented here.
While extremely fine physics-controlled mesh was used in 2D models
with maximum element size of 8.04 × 10–2 mm
and minimum element size of 2.4 × 10–4 mm,
only predefined element size with maximum of 6.7 × 10–1 mm and minimum of 5 × 10–4 mm was used as
the mesh element size in 3D models. Even this control on mesh size
in 3D resulted in much larger calculation run times than 2D (more
than 10 times). In addition, the 3D calculations did not consider
cylindrical coordinate system and solved the Navier–Stokes
equations in the Cartesian coordinate system. Therefore, a similar
level of accuracy was not obtained in 3D models in comparison to 2D
models. We used some of the 3D models for a clearer presentation of
the setup and some qualitative discussions but not for quantitative
comparison with 2D models or experimental results.
