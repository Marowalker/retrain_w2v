Perovskite quantum
dots (QDs) constitute a novel and rapidly developing
field of nanotechnology with promising potential for optoelectronic
applications. However, few perovskite materials for QDs and other
nanostructures have been theoretically explored. In this study, we
present a wide spectrum of different hybrid halide perovskite cuboid-like
QDs with the general formula of ABX3 with varying sizes
well below the Bohr exciton radius. Density functional theory (DFT)
and time-dependent DFT calculations were employed to determine their
structural, electronic, and optical properties. Our calculations include
both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric QDs, and our results reveal
several materials with high optical absorption and application-suitable
electronic and optical gaps. Our study highlights the potential as
well as the challenges and issues regarding nanostructured halide
perovskite materials, laying the background for future theoretical
and experimental work.

1 Introduction
As the quest for clean,
source-abundant ways for energy harvesting
in the 21st century reaches a peak, perovskite materials have played
a significant role in the research for solar energy applications,
such as photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).1−3 An enormous amount of theoretical and experimental work in the last
2 decades has, and continues to, explored the potential of these materials.
The majority of the research on perovskites has been concentrated
on macrostructured bulk version of these materials. However, in the
last years, an increasing amount of research has been carried out
on the nanostructures of perovskite materials, in the form of quantum
dots (QDs) as well as nanowires and nanorods. The size of these materials
(below 10 nm, and even as small as 2 nm) ensures the occurrence of
quantum confinement effects, which enable the materials under study
to be used in fields where quantum mechanical properties play a decisive
role, such as LED technology and even materials for quantum computers.

A perovskite material has the general formula of ABX3, where if A is a monovalent cation, then B is usually a divalent
cation of dissimilar size, and X is a monovalent anion to achieve
charge neutrality. In the case of emerging halide perovskites, X is
a halogen such as Cl, Br, or I. The A cation can be inorganic, such
as Cs, or organic, such as a methylammonium cation (CH3NH3+, MA). The basic structure of ABX3 formula is an octahedron, whereas the final structure of the bulk
material can be anything from a high-symmetry cuboid to a low-symmetry
monoclinic structure. The family of perovskite materials used in this
study consists of MABX3 and CsBX3 perovskites
with cubic structures, where B is a cation such as Pb, Sn, Ge, Ca,
and Sr and X is a halogen such as Cl, Br, and I. These materials have
been well studied in the literature and exhibit an abundance of sought-after
properties, such as low cost, low difficulty of synthesis, and high
carrier mobility.

In addition to the vast amount of literature
on bulk perovskites,
there is a limited yet rapidly growing number of experimental studies
on halide perovskite nanostructures, mainly QDs. Most of these studies
regard a few specific materials such as cesium lead (CsPbBr3)1−8 and methylammonium lead perovskites, such as MAPbBr3 and
MAPbI3.9−13 On the other hand, very few theoretical studies on perovskite QDs
with first-principles calculations have been conducted so far.14,15 Thus, a thorough, ab initio study of a great variety of various-sized
QDs of different materials of the MABX3 formula was in
place and could be a basis for future in-depth experimental and theoretical
research.

Experimental studies in perovskite QDs share some
common features
that were used as a guide for our study. Some of these features include
the shape of the QDs, which is generally cuboid. Substitution of halide
anions (i.e., Br with Cl) does not change the cubic structure of the
QDs.10 In order for the structure to be
considered a QD, its average size must be under 2 × rB, where rB is the exciton
Bohr radius. The Bohr radii for MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3, for instance, are 2 and 2.2 nm, respectively.11 Generally, the perovskite QDs studied have a diameter below
10 nm, with a general average size of 3 nm, and some of them even
less than 1.8 nm.4,5,10,12,13,16−18 Another shared feature of the
studied QDs is that, compared to the corresponding band gap of the
bulk material, their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap is always wider and increases
further as the QD size decreases.10 The
gap generally decreases exponentially as the QD size increases, converging
to the bulk value when the QD size surpasses the 2 × rB limit.5 Similarly,
the exciton binding energy, which is significantly enhanced in small
QDs, is a decreasing function of size. For example, the bulk value
of Ex for MAPbBr3 is 65 meV,
whereas in the small QD regime, it can be as large as ∼300–400
meV.9,10,12

The
ability of many of the experimentally studied perovskite QDs
to exhibit strong optical absorption and emission in the visible optical
regime makes them suitable candidates for optoelectronic applications
such as LEDs. In the present study, we focus on the electronic and
optical properties of QDs of the halide perovskites having the chemical
formula ABX3, where A is either Cs or the methylammonium
cation CH3NH3+ (widely denoted in
the literature with the acronym MA), B is a divalent cation (Ge, Sr,
Pb, Ca, or Sr), and X is a halogen atom (Cl, Br, or I). These materials
in the form of QDs will exhibit electronic and optical properties
which differ substantially from their bulk properties studied before.19,20 Note that the halide perovskites with MA are often called hybrid
or organometallic halide perovskites in literature. The hybrid halide
perovskites with Ge, Sn, and especially Pb are among the most studied
perovskites in literature both experimentally and theoretically because
of their potential use in photovoltaic applications.3

The article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the
computational details. In Section 3, we analyze the
structure of both the stoichiometric (ST) and nonstoichiometric (NST)
QDs studied. In Section 4, the electronic and optical properties of the systems under study
are presented, and finally, in Section 5, we summarize our conclusions.

2 Outline
of Calculations
All calculations were performed in the framework
of density functional
theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional
of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof21 (PBE) and its hybrid analogue, to account in a more accurate way
for the exchange energy, PBE0.22 The initial
structures were optimized at the PBE level of theory, which is known
to predict accurately the structural properties, but significantly
underestimates the band gap. The resulting geometries were then used
to calculate the reliable values of the single-particle HOMO–LUMO
gap with the help of the PBE0 functional. The optical properties were
calculated on top of the PBE0 results, using the time-dependent DFT
(TDDFT). In particular, we performed TDDFT calculations in both random-phase
approximation and Tamm–Dancoff approximations, while we also
employed the simplified TDDFT (sTDDFT) approximation of Grimme,23,24 which is most suitable for larger systems where traditional TDDFT
becomes prohibitive. It should be clarified that in the context of
the present manuscript, we consider as optical gap, the energy of
the lowest spin allowed transition regardless of its oscillator strength.
This was necessary because all the alkaline earth metal dots exhibit
vanishing oscillator strengths. Confusion is avoided by noticing the
strength values which are explicitly presented in all absorption spectra
plots.

As the aim of the project is to extend to larger nanostructures,
we chose a basis set of double zeta quality (namely, the def2-SVP
basis sets of the Karlsruhe group25,26), which has
been extensively tested to numerous cases and in the same time is
small enough to allow for calculations in systems with hundreds of
atoms. All calculations were performed with the ORCA suite of programs.27,28

3 ST and NST-QDs
The construction of NP models can be easily achieved by
suitably
repeating a fundamental building block along the tree spatial directions.
If the building block is the unit cell of the material (i.e., A1B1X3), then the atoms of the resulting
structures satisfy the same ratios (i.e., 1/1/3) with the corresponding
bulk material. In this context, the NPs derived by repeating this
building block two times in each direction are denoted as 2 ×
2 × 2, whereas when repeated three times, they are labeled 3
× 3 × 3. The size of the resulting nanocrystals is approximately
∼1.0 and 1.5 nm. This type of QDs (which in the present work
are labeled ST), although build upon the same principle as the bulk,
exhibits a surface local environment which is structurally very different
from the bulk. In particular, the BX6 octahedra, which
constitute the backbone of the material, are truncated, exposing either
the A or the B cations in three out of six facets of the cuboid QD.
This observation led us to an alternative route of QD construction,
based on the principle that the BX6 octahedra should not
be truncated. Apparently, this leads to violation of the 1/1/3 ratio
of the bulk, and consequently, it results in charged NPs (which in
the present work are labeled NST). The charge problem can be tackled
in two different ways. The first is based on starting with NPs with
full surface coverage by A cations and removing a suitable number
of them (i.e., create vacancies) in order to achieve neutrality. The
second way is based on excluding all the surface cations as it might
be argued that they are relatively loosely bound to the BX6 octahedra skeleton and as a result they are easier to desorb. In
this case, the excessive charge can be compensated by a suitable surface
passivation. In the present manuscript, we have considered only the
second type of NST QDs. Their passivation is achieved by pseudohydrogens
(in order to maintain neutrality) and the surface A cations are considered
desorbed. The size of the resulting 2 × 2 × 2 and 3 ×
3 × 3 NST QDs is approximately ∼1.2 and 1.9 nm, respectively.
The two distinct types of QDs are graphically presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 (a) ST CsPbX3 QDs, (b) hydrogen-passivated NST CsPbX3 QDs, and (c)
hydrogen-passivated NST MAPbX3 QDs.

The first part of calculations was focused on CsPbX3, (X = Cl, Br, I) NPs, which consist of a much easier system to study
(compared to MA analogues) and the relevant literature is more abundant.
In this way, the theoretical approximations and methodological choices
could be rigorously evaluated, offering a useful insight with regard
to the study of the more complicated case of MA containing NPs. Moreover,
it was a first step toward examining different key morphological characteristics
of the QDs such as composition and surface passivation and allowed
us to consider explicitly the two aforementioned categories of QDs,
avoiding the computational difficulties introduced by the presence
of methylammonium as cation A. In particular, the NPs are free of
the extra degrees of freedom, which are introduced by the presence
of CH3NH3+ (giving huge optimization
difficulties). Especially for the case of ST QDs, where the cations
A are on the surface of the dot, if A = CH3NH3+, then the convergence of geometric relaxation is almost
impossible. This is a manifestation of a very flat potential energy
surface because of the fact that CH3NH3+ is weakly bound to the backbone structure and it can almost
freely rotate relative to it. On the contrary, if cation A is a single
atom, these problems are vanished and the geometric relaxation is
straightforward.

As already mentioned, the NST QDs violate the
bulk atomic ratios
and require suitable surface passivation in order to remain neutral.
If this step is omitted, then the resulting NPs exhibit self-consistent
field convergence problems because of the existence of multiple-gap
states, giving a false impression of metallic behavior. The passivation
is achieved by capping the halide edges of the cubes with pseudohydrogen
atoms (Figure 1b),
leading to chemically and structurally stable nanostructures. Experimentally,
this is usually accomplished with long molecular species such as octylamine.10,13 Including such large molecules in our calculations would make the
computational cost of the passivants even larger than the one for
the actual QD. As a result, we adopted the solution of passivating
pseudohydrogen atoms, with their atomic numbers set to 0.792 and 0.85185
for the 2 × 2 × 2 (24 hydrogen atoms) and 3 × 3 ×
3 (54 hydrogen atoms) QDs, respectively. On top of this, an additional
geometric constrain was imposed on them. Although their bond lengths
were allowed to change on the course of geometric relaxation, the
bond angles were kept fixed. This can be rationalized if one considers
that in reality, the passivation is achieved by ligands which, in
most cases, are long-chain molecules. As a result, the variation of
the angles B–X–R is more or less hindered because of
steric interactions and the shape of the QDs is stabilized and maintained.
This combination of hydrogen passivation and angle freezing somehow
imitates the passivating and stabilizing effect that the molecular
ligands have on the structure, while in the same time makes the computational
cost of the calculations affordable.

Right after the evaluation
of the CsPbX3, (X = Cl, Br,
I) results, we turned our focus on the ABX3 systems with
A = CH3NH3+ obeying the same building
principles as above. This time, the B cation was set to B = Sn, Pb,
Ge, Ca, Sr, while X = Cl, Br, I. The NST structures have a total of
52 (+24 passivating hydrogens) atoms (size 2 × 2 × 2) and
199 (+54 passivating hydrogens) atoms (size 3 × 3 × 3).
The ST NPs consist of 96 and 324 atoms, respectively. It should be
emphasized that because of the very flat potential energy surface,
which is a consequence of the loose binding of surface CH3NH3+ cations, the convergence of geometry optimizations
is very difficult. For this reason, it was considered necessary to
terminate the optimization procedure when the energy reached a very
flat and horizontal plateau. Apparently, this practice affects the
quality of specific results by introducing some small error bars,
which are estimated to be smaller than 0.1 eV. This estimation is
consistent with the molecular dynamics (MD) calculations of ref (14) in which the sampling
of HOMO–LUMO gap during the MD steps led to this value.

The sizes of the NPs considered are approximately ∼0.9–1.0
and ∼1.4–1.6 nm for the 2 × 2 × 2 and 3 ×
3 × 3 ST QDs, respectively, and ∼1.1–1.3 and ∼1.8–2.0
nm for the corresponding NST.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NPs
The comparison
of the results between ST and hydrogen-passivated
NST CsPbX3 QDs gives some interesting insight with regard
to two interconnected but distinct aspects of the subject. Primarily,
it gives evidence on whether the adopted hydrogen passivation scheme
is reliable, when the focus is on the size dependence of the HOMO–LUMO
and optical gaps of the related materials, and secondarily, it serves
as an initial step toward understanding possible deviations from the
expected size dependence due to surface manipulation of the QDs.

The first straightforward observation which can be made by a simple
inspection of the HOMO–LUMO and optical gap data compiled in Table 1 is related to the
performance of the two different functionals. As expected, there is
a systematic difference between the PBE and PBE0 values, which can
be readily attributed to the well-known tendency of the pure GGA functionals
to underestimate the gaps. Moreover, it can be seen that, in almost
all cases (considered here), the PBE HOMO–LUMO and optical
gaps are practically identical. It is worth noting that this picture
is somehow unrealistic as it does not account for the exciton binding
energy which is defined as the difference between the single particle
and the optical gaps. On the other hand, the PBE0 results appear to
be consistent in this respect, predicting exciton binding energies
ranging from 210 to 600 meV.

a The calculations have been performed
with the PBE and PBE0 functionals and the def2-SVP basis set. Bulk
values (experimental and theoretical) can be found in ref (20).

As for the difference between ST and NST QDs, it is
evident that
the results are strongly dependent on the type of halogen. For X =
Cl, the NST NPs exhibit a significantly larger optical gap, while
as we go to heavier halogen, the difference gets smaller (or even
reversed for X = I). A qualitative interpretation can be obtained
with the help of the corresponding density of states (DOS) diagrams
presented in Figure 2a,b. On the left panel of these figures, there are comparative DOS
plots for the ST and NST NPs. In all cases, the presence of passivants
results in a shift of valence states which are close to HOMO, deeper
into the valence band. Taking into consideration that these states
are mostly halogen-related, it might be inferred that this is the
result of a strong X–H bond. The implication of the presence
of such strong bonds between the surface halogens and the passivating
pseudohydrogens indirectly affects the position of the low-energy
conduction band (CB) states. As these CB states are mostly related
to the B cation through the antibonding interaction B–X, their
shift toward lower energies is indicative of a weaker B–X bonding
(which is the consequence of the strong X–H bond). These qualitative
arguments are also supported by a Mayer bond order analysis.

Figure 2 Comparative
DOS plot of ST and NST CsPbCl3 and MAPbCl3 cuboids
of size (a) 2 × 2 × 2 and (b) 3 ×
3 × 3.

As the size of the studied
QDs is quite small, comparison with
experimental data can be attempted by extrapolating existing experimental
data to the current sizes. In particular, if the experimental data
of Figure 3b of ref (5) (for CsPbBr3) are fitted in a function of the form y = a + b/xc, the outcome is y =
2.18 + 1.55/x0.82. For the NST CsPbBr3 dots, application of this formula to sizes relevant to our
present calculations (2 × 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 × 3)
gives gap values of 3.49 and 3.11 eV, respectively. Similarly, the
corresponding values for the ST dots (2 × 2 × 2 and 3 ×
3 × 3) are 3.83 and 3.28 eV. These extrapolated values, although
rather uncertain, are consistent with the data of ref (17) and indicate that the
PBE results appear to significantly underestimate the value of the
optical gap (in both ST and NST cases). On the contrary, the predictions
of the PBE0 calculations, especially for the case of ST QDs, and the
aforementioned extrapolated values appear to be in very good agreement
∼0.15 eV. This is strong evidence that the adopted computational
methodology is capable of producing reliable results. Moreover, it
hints that despite the presence of truncated octahedra, the ST configurations
offer a more realistic description of the QDs.

In all CsPbX3 NPs studied, the PBE0 exciton binding
energy (which is considered as the difference between the single-particle
gap and the optical gap) exhibits a theoretically consistent trend.
For the 2 × 2 × 2 ST QDs, the corresponding values are , , and  and they shift to smaller values
as the
size of the dots increases. In particular, for the 3 × 3 ×
3 QDs, the red shift is as large as 80, 210, and 180 meV, respectively.
A similar picture (but with larger values) is also observed for the
case on NST dots, , , and  with the corresponding red shifts
of 160,
140, and 270 meV.

4.2 MABX3 (X = Cl,
Br, I) NPs
The case of MABX3 (B = Sn, Pb, Ge,
Ca, Sr/X = Cl, Br,
I) NPs was a much more challenging task mainly because of the difficulties
described in the previous paragraph. Contrary to what happened in
cesium-containing dots, the relaxation procedure (especially for ST
NPs) leads to significant distortions of the initial geometries, which
are more pronounced in the smaller QDs. As expected, the BX6 octahedra, apart from being truncated in three out of six facets
of the QD, they also deviate from the ideal symmetric structure. The
CH3NH3+ species exhibit a wide range
of orientations, which depend heavily on their relative position within
the dot. A general trend which (more or less) appears to be present
in all cases is that the surface CH3NH3+ moieties seem to adopt an orientation with their NH3 part toward the surface of the cube and the CH3 group
directed outward.

The electronic structure of ST and NST QDs
of the most commonly used MAPbX3 materials is presented
with the help of DOS diagrams, in the right panes of Figure 2a,b (for the two different
QD sizes). Once again, the presence of pseudohydrogen passivation
seems to shift the band edges toward lower energies. The source of
this shift appears to be the same as the one described for the case
of CsPbX3 NPs. The related gaps are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Similar diagrams for all the NPs considered (but only for
the 3 × 3 × 3 size) are plotted in Figure 3. The red shift of the band edges is clear
in all B = Pb, Sn, Ge QDs and becomes stronger as the halogen type
gets heavier. For the case of B = Ca, Sr dots, the picture changes
drastically. Although the tendency of the band edges to shift to lower
energies as the halogen type gets heavier remains, the ordering with
regard to the position of the ST band edges is reversed. The complete
picture of the gap variations for both the ST and NST QDs can be conveniently
realized with the help of Figure 4, which makes the existing trends apparent (the data
are taken from Tables 2 and 3).

The absorption spectra
presented in Figure 5 have been calculated in two steps. At first,
the lowest few spin allowed transitions are calculated at the PBE0/TDDFT/def2-SVP
level of theory giving the reported optical gap. Then, a few hundreds
of states are calculated with Grimme’s sTDDFT method.24 The absorption spectrum is created by introducing
a suitable Lorentzian broadening to all excited states, while in the
same time, the sTDDFT results are properly shifted so that the lowest
transition coincides with the corresponding PBE0/TDDFT/def2-SVP one.

If one attempts to compare with
experimental results in a fashion
similar to the one adopted for the case of Cs containing NPs (i.e.,
fit the experimental data and extrapolate to current sizes), several
inconsistencies may be observed. For example, it is not uncommon that
the reported gaps of similar sizes, but from different studies, do
not suit well in a common graph. If, however, we use a single manuscript
data (e.g., the experimental results from Zhenfu et al.29) and fit them to the usual formula y = a + b/xc, the outcome is y = 2.61
+ 2.36/x1.82. If this is extrapolated
to current sizes, then for the case of ST 3 × 3 × 3 MAPbBr3 NPs, one gets the value of ∼3.74 eV, whereas for the
NST ones, the value is ∼3.34 eV. These extrapolated estimations
are consistent with both the ST and NST theoretical predictions (3.71
and 3.57 eV). However, the comparison highly favors the case of ST
QDs. Moreover, if one focuses on the PL energy differences observed29 in halogen replacement (i.e., Cl → Br
→ I), they are completely consistent with the present theoretical
values which are graphically presented in Figure 4. In particular, the experimental values
are ΔE(PL)Cl→Brexp = 0.63 eV, ΔE(PL)Br→Iexp = 0.66 eV, and ΔE(PL)Cl→Iexp = 1.29 eV, where
the current theoretical predictions for the ST QDs are ΔECl→Brth = 0.57 eV, ΔEBr→Ith = 0.74 eV, and ΔECl→Ith = 1.31 eV. The corresponding data of the NST NPs exhibit
significant deviations from the experimental measurement. At this
point, it should be clarified that our theoretical prediction corresponds to absorption energies (not PL). However, it
is experimentally verified that the Stokes shift between absorption
and emission is quite small (due to direct transitions). As a result,
the aforementioned comparison of energy differences might be considered
valid. It is worth noting that once again the comparison with experimental
data reveals that the ST NPs produce results which are closer to experiments.

For the cases of MAPbX3 and MASnX3 NPs, there
is a clear trend that the NST QDs have stronger transitions. The MACaX3 and MASrX3 QDs exhibit practically vanishing oscillator
strengths. At this point, it should be emphasized that in energies
well above the optical gap, the height of the peaks is dictated by
the DOS rather than the strength of individual transitions. As a means
to shed light on this difference, we have plotted the orbital-resolved
projected DOS (PDOS) diagrams for two representative NPs along with
a graphic representation of their HOMO and LUMO orbitals in Figure 6. The HOMO, HOMO
– 1, and so forth states of MAPbCl3 are mainly Cl(p)
states while the LUMO, LUMO + 1, and so forth are Pb(p). Additionally,
a composition analysis with the help of Multiwfn code30 revealed that the specific states are quite extended, as
is evident in their three-dimensional plots of Figure 6. On the contrary, the corresponding states
of the MACaCl3 QDs are Cl(p) and Ca(s), whereas on the
same time, the wave functions exhibit a significant localization on
specific atoms (see Figure 6). This completely different picture is reflected on the shape
and details of the corresponding absorption spectra. As expected,
in all ST QDs, the frontier orbitals are mainly distributed on the
surfaces of the cuboids. This allows for property manipulation through
appropriate surface treatment.

QDs. The HOMO
and LUMO orbitals are also plotted as a means to qualitatively point
the differences of the two systems.

5 Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have performed extensive ground-state DFT and
excited-state TDDFT calculations on a large number of ultrasmall perovskite
QDs having the chemical formula ABX3, where A is either
Cs or the methylammonium cation CH3NH3 (MA),
B is a divalent cation (Ge, Sr, Pb, Ca, or Sr), and X is a halogen
atom (Cl, Br, or I). For every different material and size examined,
two types of dots were considered (ST and pseudohydrogen-passivated
NST). In all cases, the single-particle gap, the optical gap, and
the absorption spectra were systematically calculated and compared.
It is found that the gaps are always a decreasing function of the
atomic number of the halogen. The surface passivation by capping the
halogen atoms results in a red shift of both the valence and CB edges
(HOMO and LUMO orbitals) as compared to unpassivated ST dots for all
QDs (although NPs with Ge as a B cation seem to suffer from stability
issues). The NPs which contain alkaline earth metals exhibit a different
behavior with respect to the ones containing one of the isovalent
Ge, Pb, and Sn. The absorption spectra of Pb and Sn containing QDs
exhibit strong transitions, which are even more enhanced for the case
of pseudohydrogen-passivated NST QDs. On the contrary, Ca and Sr NPs
exhibit vanishing oscillator strengths, which are related to the nature
of their frontier orbitals which appear to be extremely localized.
Finally, although the NST QDs with the complete octahedra possess
a structural configuration which is more appealing to the eye, the
comparison with experimental data reveals that the ST QDs exhibit
gaps closer to the experimental ones.

Our study highlights the
potential as well as the challenges and
issues regarding nanostructured halide perovskite materials and paves
the way for future theoretical and experimental work on these materials.
