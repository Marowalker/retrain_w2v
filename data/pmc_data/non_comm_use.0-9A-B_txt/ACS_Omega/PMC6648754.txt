Single
crystal of novel orange-red emission CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor was grown by our original
vapor phase technique, and the precise crystal structure was investigated
for the first time by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The
crystal structure of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single crystal was verified to be an α-Si3N4-type trigonal structure (space group P31c) with a = 0.79525(9) nm, c = 0.57712(8) nm, and z = 2. The Ca atoms
were coordinated to seven nitrogen atoms and located in the three-dimensional
framework formed by (Al, Si)N4 tetrahedra. The single-crystal
CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphors
exhibited a broad reddish-yellow emission with a peak at 600 nm under
near-UV and blue light excitation. When increasing the temperature
up to 150 °C, the emission intensity of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor decreased to 88% of
the initial value at 25 °C.

Introduction
In a solid-state lighting
system, phosphors are the key materials
regulating the luminescence emission efficiency and color rendering
index of white light-emitting diodes (LEDs).1 The development of novel phosphors having high luminescence emission
intensity under near-UV or blue light excitation and having a low
thermal quenching effect is considered the most promising approach
to obtain the high luminescence efficiency of white LEDs.2,3 To develop a novel phosphor for white LEDs, investigation of the
crystal structure of phosphors using a single crystal is significantly
important because the luminescence properties of the phosphor strongly
depend on the crystal structure of the host materials.4−12 In particular, the excitation and emission band positions of Eu2+- or Ce3+-activated phosphors are remarkably affected
by the coordination environment of the cation site replaced with an
activator.13

Recently, (oxy)nitride
phosphors have been extensively investigated
for use in white LEDs due to their excellent luminescence emission
efficiency and high thermal and chemical stabilities.14−18 Some (oxy)nitride phosphors, such as CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASN),3,19,20 Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+,21−24 Cam/2Si12–m–nAlm+nOnN16–n:Eu2+ (Ca-α-SiAlON),25−28 and Si6–zAlzOzN8–z:Eu2+ (β-SiAlON),29−32 are usually used in white LEDs
as commercial red- or green-emission phosphors. Additionally, the
oxide and fluoride phosphors, such as NaMgPO4:Eu2+,33 Ca2SiO4:Eu2+,34,35 La4GeO8:Bi3+,36 K2SiF6:Mn4+,37−49 and K2TiF6:Mn4+,40 are recently reported as new red emission phosphors for
use in white LEDs. The crystal structure of these phosphors has been
widely studied for a long time using powder crystal structure analysis.
The luminescence mechanism has been also identified in detail based
on the result of crystal structure analysis. According to a recent
report, the concentration of oxygen contained in the crystal lattice
has a significant effect on the luminescence properties of (oxy)nitride
phosphors, such as emission intensity, emission peak position, and
thermal degradation.41 However, powder
crystal structure analysis has difficulty in accurately determining
the crystallographic environment around the activator in the crystal
lattice.

The crystal structure of inorganic materials is generally
analyzed
by powder or single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Among these
two different analysis methods, single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis
is well known to be suitable for accurately determining the crystal
structure of inorganic materials. However, nitride materials have
a high melting temperature and require elaborate atmosphere adjustment
to grow the fine single crystal of nitride phosphor. Therefore, the
conventional single crystal growth methods, such as Czochralski method,42−44 flux method,45−47 microwave plasma CVD,48,49 and others,
have difficultly to grow the single crystal of phosphor materials,
in which an activator is uniformly distributed in the crystal lattice.

In contrast, we have previously developed a new vapor phase technique,
which is gas- and solid-phase hybridized, to grow the phosphor single
crystal with high purity.50 Using this
method, we successfully grew the single crystal of alkali earth orthosilicate
phosphors, Ba2SiO4:Eu2+, and succeeded
in determining the crystal structure of Ba2SiO4:Eu2+ phosphors in detail.50

In this study, we attempted to grow the nitride single crystal
with a multiple mixture composition of Ca–Al–Si–Eu,
in which the Eu content was fixed to be 2 mol% by our original solid–vapor
hybrid synthetic technique. Among the multiple composition, we found
a single crystal with a chemical composition of Ca0.99Eu0.01Al2.1Si4.3N8.7 (i.e.,
CaAl2Si4N8) in the mixture composition
of Ca/Al/Si = 1.5:1:1. The theoretical chemical composition of CaAl2Si4N8 has already been reported by Jack
in 1983 as pure nitride-type Ca-α-SiAlON obtained from the composition
equation of Cam/2Si12–m–nAlm+nOnN16–n.51 According to previous
reports, it has an experimental solid solubility limit for Ca content
in the pure nitride-type Cam/2Si12–m–nAlm+nOnN16–n composition due to the inclusion of oxygen in the
crystal lattice, and the highest solubility of Ca content was obtained
for Ca1.83Si8.34Al3.66N16 (i.e., Ca0.915Al1.83Si4.17N8).51,52 In addition, Nagatomi et al.
and Yang et al. recently reported the pure nitride-type Ca-α-SiAlON:Eu2+ phosphor with a composition of Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16 (i.e., Ca0.995Eu0.005Al2Si4N8), and
this composition of phosphor shows the yellow emission peaked at 586
nm.53,54 Yang et al. investigated the crystal structure
of Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16 by powder X-ray diffraction refinement, and the obtained
lattice parameters are a = 0.78726 nm, c = 0.57226 nm, and V = 0.30716 nm3.54 The chemical composition of Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16 reported
in these papers is the theoretical composition, and it is not described
as an analyzed composition of Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16.

In this paper, therefore,
the precise crystal structure data and
chemical composition of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor were investigated in detail using the single
crystal obtained in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report to have verified the precise crystallographic
data and chemical composition of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ using a single crystal. The CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphors are
also synthesized by the high gas pressure sintering method based on
the result of the single-crystal structure analysis as the comparison
sample.

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure Analysis of the Single
Crystal of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ Phosphor
The polarized microscopy image under blue light
(450 nm) excitation
of the single crystal obtained from the mixture, in which the ratio
of cations is Ca/Al/Si = 1.5:1.0:1.0, is shown in Figure 1. The obtained single crystal
was formed as a hexagonal column sharp with dimensions of 0.11 mm
× 0.11 mm × 0.10 mm, which makes it suitable for analysis
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Under excitation at 365 nm, the
single crystal presents a red emission. The chemical composition of
the single crystal is determined by EPMA, and the result is given
in Table 1. The determined
chemical composition of the single crystal is Ca0.99Eu0.01Al2.1Si4.3N8.7, which
is normalized based on the amount of Ca and Eu. According to the EPMA
result, oxygen was not detected in the single crystal. In addition,
homogeneous distribution of all elements was observed in the single
crystal obtained in this study. Detailed crystallographic data and
structure refinement parameters of the Ca0.99Eu0.01Al2.1Si4.3N8.7 single crystal determined
by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The crystal structure model of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+, based on the crystallographic data
obtained by X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis, is illustrated
in Figure 2. The crystallographic
information file (CIF) of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single crystal is given in the Supporting
Information. The single crystal of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ was refined in the trigonal structure with
the space group of P31c (no. 159),
and the lattice parameters are a = 0.79525(9) nm, c = 0.57712(8) nm, V = 0.31609(8) nm3, and Z = 2. The obtained lattice parameters
of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single crystal is larger than those of Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16 reported by Yang et al.
(a = 0.78726 nm, c = 0.57226 nm,
and V = 0.30716 nm3).54 This is considered to be likely due to the inclusion of
oxygen in the crystal lattice of the reported Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16 phosphor. Since
the ionic radius of O2– (0.138 nm for four coordination)55 is smaller than that of N3– (0.146 nm for four coordination),55 the
inclusion of O2– in the crystal lattice usually
results in the reduction of the lattice parameters of nitride materials.

Fractional atomic coordinates and isotropic or equivalent isotropic

the crystal lattice present 97.7(6), 0.21(8), and 1.79(8), respectively,
in which the (Ca + Eu) content was normalized as 100%. The occupancy
rates of each cation obtained by single-crystal structure analysis
are similar to the result of EPMA (Table 1). Since the dopant amount of Eu2+ is very small, Eu2+ was not observed for the refinement
of the crystal structure. As shown in Figure 2, Ca atoms occupy the site coordinated by
seven nitrogen atoms, and Si/Al atoms occupy two different tetrahedral
sites having different crystallographic environments, Si(2) and Si(3)
sites, respectively. The Si2 site is fully occupied by Si atoms, and
the Si3 site is replaced in part by Al atoms, in which the ratio of
Si/Al was determined to be 0.79(8)/0.21(8). The Si/Al tetrahedra are
linked by corner-sharing and form the three-dimensional network structure.
Ca/Eu occupies the polyhedral site formed by the (Si/Al)N4 tetrahedral network with strong covalent bonding. The bond distance
of Ca–N ranges from 0.2370(4) to 0.2657(3) nm with an average
bond distance of 0.2581 nm. The Si2–N and (Si3/Al3)–N

Crystal Structure
Analysis of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ Powder Phosphor
CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor was synthesized
by the high nitrogen gas pressure sintering method based on the crystallographic
data obtained by single-crystal structure analysis. Rietveld refinement
analysis is carried out to determine the crystal structure of the
CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder
phosphor. The crystallographic data of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single crystal are used as a
starting model. Figure 3 shows the observed (red), calculated (blue), and difference (green)
XRD profiles for the XRD Rietveld refinement of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder. Most XRD peaks of the
powder phosphor are well indexed to the XRD pattern obtained by single-crystal
analysis, and a weak peak ascribed to an unknown impurity phase was
observed in the powder XRD patterns. Table S1 summarizes the detailed crystallographic data and structure refinement
parameters obtained by Rietveld refinement analysis. The refinement
is finally converged to Rwp = 5.113%, RP = 3.205%, RF =
2.208%, and S = 4.0690. The lattice parameters are a = 0.79555 nm, c = 0.57701 nm, and V = 0.31626 nm3, which is larger than those of
the single-crystal phosphor (Table S2).
The chemical composition of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor is analyzed by EPMA, and
the result is summarized in Table 1. The content of each element was detected to be different
from the stoichiometric ratio, which is probably due to the existence
of impurities or oxygen.

Figure 3 Observed (red + symbol) and calculated (blue
line) X-ray powder
diffraction data of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor prepared the difference profile
(green line) between them, and Bragg reflection peak positions are
shown as vertical bars.

These results indicate that it is difficult to obtain the
pure
CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor
by the conventional high nitrogen gas pressure sintering method. Although
the composition and lattice volume of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor are different from
the single-crystal phosphor, the crystallographic data of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphors
are different from the conventional Ca-α-SiAlON (Ca0.67Al2Si10O0.7N15.3 or Ca1.99Eu0.01Al4Si8N16),54,56 which is probably due to the different contents
of the Ca and O in the phosphor lattice.

Luminescence Properties
The excitation and emission
spectra of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single crystal and powder phosphors are presented in Figure 4. The excitation
spectrum consists of two broad optical absorption bands from 250 to
500 nm, which can be covered by the region from UV to visible light
part due to the 4f → 5d transition of Eu2+. A strong
optical absorption in the near-UV and blue light region indicates
that the phosphor is suitable for a color converter of white LED-based
near-UV or blue LED. The emission spectra of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single-crystal and powder phosphors
exhibit a broad orange-red emission. The emission band position of
powder phosphor (590 nm) was obtained at a shorter wavelength side
than that of the single-crystal phosphor (600 nm), which can be explained
by the oxygen content in the phosphor lattice (Table 1). For the emission band shift of the Eu2+-activated phosphors, it is usually explained by the centroid
shift (εc) and the crystal field splitting (εcfs) of the 5d energy level of Eu2+.57−59 In the host lattice, the 5d energy level will split due to the crystal
field strength, which depends on the distance between the luminescence
ion and anions and the ionic radius of the cation and coordination
number of cation ion polyhedral. The centroid shift represents the
nephelauxetic effect, which depends on the bonding strength between
the luminescence ion (Eu2+) and the anion ligands of the
host lattice. With increasing bonding strength, the emission band
of Eu2+-activated phosphor shifts to a longer wavelength
side due to a low energy shift of the 5d energy level center. Since
the formation energy of N3– from atomic N (+2300
kJ mol–1) is higher than that of O2– from atomic O (+700 kJ mol–1), the bonding strength
of Eu2+–N3+ is stronger than that of
Eu2+–O2–.60 Therefore, the oxygen atom included in the crystal lattice of nitride
phosphors leads to a reduction of the bonding strength of Eu2+–anion ligands, which usually results in the 5d energy level
center shifts to the higher energy side. Thus, the emission band of
the powder phosphor shifted to a shorter wavelength side compared
with the single-crystal phosphor. A small amount of oxygen was detected
in the powder phosphor; consequently, the powder phosphor shows a
shorter wavelength emission than the single-crystal phosphor. Although
the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder
phosphor included a small amount of oxygen, the emission band position
of the powder phosphor is located at a longer wavelength side compared
to the commercial Ca-α-SiAlON phosphor (Ca0.625Eu0.025Si10.675Al1.325O0.025N15.975; λem = 580 nm).61 The internal quantum efficiency of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor was 78%
under excitation at 450 nm, which is similar to that of a commercial
red-emission phosphor Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ (∼80%).61 The CIE chromaticity
coordinate values for the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor were x = 0.54 and y = 0.46 under excitation at 365 nm. The CIE values of the
CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ indicate
that this phosphor has higher color purity of red emission than that
of the conventional Ca-α-SiAlON (x = 0.491, y = 0.497)61 and pure nitride-type
Ca-α-SiAlON (x = 0.521, y =
0.473).54

Figure 4 Normalized excitation (broken line) and
emission (solid line) spectra
of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder
(black line) and single-crystal phosphors (red line).

The emission intensity of a phosphor generally
decreases with increasing
temperature due to the thermal quenching effect. Therefore, the temperature
dependence of the phosphor is significantly important in white LED
applications. Figure 5 presents the temperature dependence of the emission intensity of
the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder
phosphor under excitation at 450 nm, normalized with respect to the
value at 25 °C. The CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder exhibits a thermal quenching behavior similar
to that of CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ and Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+, which are commercial red-emission
phosphors for white LEDs. The emission intensities of the CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ and Sr2Si5N8:Eu2+ phosphors measured at 150 °C are 86–90%
of that at 25 °C.3,18,19,61,62 When increasing
the temperature up to 150 °C, the emission intensity of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor
decreases to 88% of the initial value at 25 °C. These results
indicate that the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder is expected to find application as a red emission
phosphor for use in white LEDs.

Conclusions
A
high-purity single crystal of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor was successfully grown by
the solid–vapor hybrid technique using a high nitrogen pressurized
sintering furnace. From the X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis,
the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single
crystal phosphor has a trigonal structure with the space group of P31c. In the crystal structure of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+, (Si, Al)–N4 and Si–N4 tetrahedral corner-connected
to form a three-dimensional network structure, and Ca2+ and Eu2+ are taken into a three-dimensional framework.
The CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single
crystal and powder phosphor exhibited a broad orange-red emission
with a peak at 600 and 590 nm, respectively, and the internal quantum
efficiency of the powder phosphor under blue excitation (λex = 450 nm) was 78%. The major advantage of this study is
that it has verified for the first time the chemical composition and
the detailed crystallographic data of the pure nitride-type Ca-α-SiAlON:Eu2+ phosphor, CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+. This paper could also provide new avenues for growing the
high-purity single crystal of nitride phosphor.

Experimental Section
Solid-Vapor
Hybrid Synthetic Technique
We developed
a new type single-crystal growth technique to easily and reliably
grow the phosphor single crystal.42 This
method is a kind of chemical vapor deposition that does not require
the high purity of target materials or a high vacuum system. It used
the vaporization of one or two raw materials to make a gas phase,
and the reaction between the vaporized raw material gas and substrate
material, which is a mixture of other raw materials, occurred on the
surface of substrate materials. Furthermore, it can control the atmosphere
such as air, neutral (e.g., N2 or Ar), or reduction (e.g.,
H2–N2 or H2–Ar mixed
gas). Therefore, this method is expected to be suitable to obtain
the Eu2+-activated phosphor single crystal besides trivalent
rare earth (e.g., Eu3+, Er3+, Yb3+, etc.)-doped phosphors. Additionally, this method can control the
size of the single crystal by controlling the content of the vaporized
raw material gas, which can be controlled by the temperature or atmosphere.
The single-crystal size generally increases with increasing content
of the vaporized raw material gas.

Single-Crystal Growth of
CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+
Ca3N2 (Taiheiyo
Cement, Corp.), AlN (Tokuyama, Corp.), Si3N4 (Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.), and EuCl3 (Alfa Aesar,
A Johnson Matthey Company) were mixed using a mortar in Ar-filled
glove boxes in a mixture ratio of Ca/Al/Si = 1.5:1.0:1.0. The Eu2+ content was at 2 mol %. The homogeneous mixture was heated
in a nitrogen atmosphere of 0.9 MPa at 1800 °C for 2 h using
a vacuum and a pressurized sintering furnace “VESTA”
(Shimadzu Mectem, Inc.). In this process, we used Ca3N2 as the raw material for making the gas phase. In our previous
study, we verified the vaporization of Ca3N2 as a function of the heating temperature and the nitrogen gas pressure,
as shown in Figure S1. The content of the
vaporized Ca3N2 gas is increased with increasing
heating temperature and is decreased with increasing nitrogen gas
pressure. From the result of the optimization of the condition of
temperature (1400–1600 °C) and gas pressure (0.1–0.9
MPa), the best of the conditions is 1800 °C and 0.9 MPa, respectively,
to grow the single crystal of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor. Additionally, the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ powder phosphor was also
synthesized by a conventional high nitrogen gas pressure sintering
method based on the result of crystal structure analysis of the single
crystal of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ phosphor.

analysis of Ca, Eu, Al, Si, N, and O was carried out using an electron
probe microanalyzer (EPMA) (Shimadzu, Corp. EPMA8705). The precise
crystallographic data of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ was verified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
using a Rigaku XtaLAB mini diffractometer. A single crystal is placed
on a glass capillary, and data collection and cell refinement were
outputted by the Crystal Clear-SM Auto 2.0 rl (Rigaku, 2010). Detailed
analysis conditions for the determination of the crystal structure
of the CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ single crystal are listed in Table S1. After the measurement, structural analysis was performed using
the structural analysis software WinGX.63,64 The structure
refinement was carried out using direct methods with SHELXS97 program.65 The crystal structure of CaAl2Si4N8:Eu2+ was drawn by VESTA based on
the crystallographic data obtained by single-crystal structure analysis.66 The powder sample was characterized by X-ray
powder diffraction (XRD; Bruker Corp. D2 PHASER) analysis, and the
crystal structure analysis was carried out via Rietveld refinement
of powder XRD data using the program “RIETAN-FP”.67 The emission and excitation spectra were measured
at room temperature by using a spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Corp. FP-6500/6600).
The emission spectrum was obtained upon excitation at 410 nm, and
the excitation spectrum was obtained by monitoring the emission at
590 nm. The Commission International de I’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity
coordinate data for the phosphors were measured at room temperature
with a luminescence colorimeter (Hamamatsu C7473-36 PMA-11).
