Cold storage using hydrates for cooling
is a high-efficiency technology.
However, this technology suffers from problems such as the stochastic
nature of hydrate nucleation, cyclic hydrate formation instability,
and a low cold discharge rate. To solve these problems, it is necessary
to further clarify the characteristics of hydrate formation and dissociation
in different systems. First, a comparative experimental study in pure
water and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution systems was conducted
to explore the influence of SDS on the morphology of the hydrate and
the time needed for its formation under visualization conditions.
Subsequently, the cyclic hydrate formation stability was investigated
at different test temperatures with two types of SDS solution systems—with
or without a porous medium. The induction time, full time, and energy
consumption time ratio of the first hydrate formation process and
the cyclic hydrate reformation process were analyzed. Finally, thermal
stimulation combined with depressurization was used to intensify hydrate
dissociation compared with single thermal stimulation. The results
showed that the growth morphology of hydrate and the time required
for its formation in the SDS solution system were obviously different
than those in pure water. In addition, the calculation and comparison
results revealed that the induction time and full time of cyclic hydrate
reformation were shorter and the energy consumption time ratio was
smaller in the porous medium. The results indicated that a porous
medium could improve the cyclic hydrate formation process by making
it more stable and by decreasing time and energy costs. Thermal stimulation
combined with depressurization at different backpressures (0.1, 0.2,
0.3, and 0.4 MPa) effectively promoted the decomposition of hydrates,
and with the decrease in backpressure, the dissociation time decreased
gradually. At a backpressure of 0.1 MPa, the dissociation time was
reduced by 150 min. The experimental results presented the formation
and dissociation characteristics of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane hydrates
in different systems, which could accelerate the application of gas
hydrates in cold storage.

1 Introduction
The
unbalanced utilization of electricity, especially in the summer
for air-conditioning and refrigeration processes, appears to be an
irrepressible situation. Peak–valley electricity price is an
effective policy to solve the unbalanced utilization of electricity.
The larger the peak-to-valley electricity price difference, the more
economical the energy storage. Power supply-side peak adjustment and
user-side peak adjustment can be adopted to utilize the peak-to-valley
difference and create more value. Cold storage, a high-efficiency
user-side peak adjustment technology, can make the difference between
the peak and valley electricity prices more cost effective, whereby
cold storage occurs during the valley price period and is used at
the peak price time.1,2 However, conventional cold storage
technologies have inevitable shortcomings: low cold storage density
for water cold storage, low cold storage efficiency for ice cold storage,
and equipment aging and failure for eutectic salt cold storage.3 Therefore, cold storage using gas hydrates (with
a latent heat of phase change that is close to that of ice (335 kJ/kg),
a phase change temperature of 0–15 °C and no corrosion
of metal equipment4−7) has attracted much attention for solving these shortcomings. Gas
hydrates are ice-like crystals that host water molecules to form lattices
via hydrogen bonding to engage gas molecules at a certain temperature
and pressure.8−11 According to the selection principle of the cold storage medium,
it is also very important to choose suitable hydrates as the cold
storage medium.5 Among hydrates, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
(R134a) hydrates match well with the cold storage system due to the
lower phase equilibrium pressure (0.05–0.41 MPa12), higher phase equilibrium temperature (1–10
°C12), and larger phase change latent
heat (358 kJ/kg13). Nevertheless, R134a
hydrates in cold storage applications are limited by the large stochastic
nature of hydrate nucleation, the instability of cyclic hydrate formation
(including first hydrate formation and several repeated hydrate reformations),
and the low hydrate dissociation rate.

It is well known that
the first hydrate formation that reflects
the stochastic nature of nucleation possesses a long induction time,
implying that more time and energy must be consumed,14−16 which goes against the principle of cold storage at cost.17,18 Therefore, many efforts, such as the use of surfactants and porous
media, have been made to shorten the induction time.19−21 Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as a perfect surfactant for enhancing
hydrate formation, is widely used,22 but
there is no consensus on the characteristics of cyclic hydrate reformation
(excluding the first hydrate formation from cyclic hydrate formation).
The induction time of hydrate reformation is dramatically reduced
owing to the presence of the memory effect.23−25 Many studies
have proven that the memory effect could effectively promote hydrate
reformation.26−30 These studies found that porous media can highlight the memory effect
in hydrate reformation.29 However, it remains
unclear and controversial as to whether the memory effect maintains
stability upon cyclic hydrate reformation, and related research is
not comprehensive, especially in SDS systems or porous media.

The hydrate dissociation rate is the key to determining the cold
discharge efficiency. Different dissociation methods always cause
significant differences in the hydrate dissociation rate. Popular
methods for triggering hydrate dissociation are thermal stimulation,
inhibitor injection, and depressurization,31−38 and the addition of inhibitors is not applied in cold storage because
the inhibitors will hinder hydrate reformation. Thermal stimulation
is used to investigate the kinetics of hydrate dissociation.39−42 Depressurization is applied to explore gas hydrate exploitation
and its geological effects.43−50 Both thermal stimulation and depressurization achieve hydrate decomposition
by adjusting the temperature and pressure.51 Therefore, the driving force (temperature rise and pressure drop)
of the hydrate phase transition is the main controlling factor that
determines the cold discharge mode.52,53 At present,
single thermal stimulation is often used to decompose hydrates in
cold discharge, which cannot effectively and rapidly extract the cold
amount.54 However, our previous studies
have proven that thermal stimulation combined with depressurization
can accelerate hydrate dissociation.51 There
is no related experiment in the research of hydrate cold storage to
interpret the effect using the combined method in cold discharge.

Considering the advantages of surfactant-SDS systems and porous
media for hydrate formation, the cold storage characteristics of three
different systems (pure water system, SDS solution system, and SDS
solution with a porous medium system) were interpreted from the perspective
of the cyclic hydrate formation stability. The induction time, full
time, and energy consumption time ratio of the first hydrate formation
and cyclic hydrate reformation in the SDS solution with or without
a porous medium system at 1, 3, and 5 °C were analyzed. Thermal
stimulation combined with depressurization was applied to analyze
the hydrate dissociation characteristics for the cold discharge process,
and the backpressure was 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa. The results provide
some basic data for cold storage and cold discharge, along with a
reference for the application of hydrate cold storage technology.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Experimental Apparatus
and Materials
Figure 1a presents
a schematic of the experimental apparatus. This apparatus consisted
of a stainless steel cylindrical vessel with a design pressure of
10 MPa, two 70 mm diameter sapphire windows, and an effective volume
of 1650 mL; a gas supply system with an R134a gas cylinder and a gas
flowmeter; a data acquisition system to record the pressure and temperature;
a backpressure gas gathering system with a backpressure regulator;
an image acquisition system with a digital camera (EOS 6D, Canon Company,
lens model EF24-105 mm f/4L IS USM); and a thermostatic bath system.
The temperature of the vessel during hydrate formation and dissociation
is controlled by the thermostatic bath system (XT5718RC-E800L, Xutemp,
Hangzhou, Co., Ltd. with an accuracy of ±0.1 K and a temperature
varying from −15 to 50 °C). Two temperature transducers
(Pt-1000 with an accuracy of ±0.2%) and a pressure transducer
(Unik 5000 with a pressure limit of 25 MPa and precision of 0.25%
FS) were connected to the vessel.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram of the experimental
apparatus; (b) gas and
liquid distributions in the pure water system and SDS solution system
(without a porous medium); (c) gas, liquid, and porous medium distributions
in the SDS solution with a porous medium system.

In this study, three systems, including a pure water system,
SDS
solution system, and SDS solution with a porous medium system, were
used for hydrate formation and dissociation. As shown in Figure 1b,c, the experimental
materials in the three systems were 600 g deionized water, 600 g 300
ppm SDS solution, and 250 g 300 ppm SDS solution and 900 g glass beads,
respectively. The amounts of water in the three systems were in excess
for hydrate formation, which meant that some of the water remained
after hydrate formation. The charge amount of the R134a gas was approximately
0.94 mol, as measured by the flowmeter. Because of the low solubility
of R134a gas (25 °C, 0.15%) in water,55 when the initial temperature was 17 °C, the pressure was basically
maintained at 0.49 MPa. The 99.99% R134a gas in this study is supplied
by Shandong Dongyue Chemical Co., Ltd. Glass beads with particle sizes
ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mm were used to fill the vessel to simulate
the porous medium layer.

2.2 Procedures
2.2.1 Hydrate Formation
The experimental
materials were first placed in the vessel. Subsequently, the vessel
was purged with R134a gas to a pressure of 0.49 MPa three times to
ensure that the gas occupying the void space within the vessel was
purely R134a. Then, the vessel temperature was set at 17 °C.
The vessel was then pressurized to 0.49 MPa with R134a gas, and the
system was left to stabilize. After the temperature and pressure of
the system stabilized, the vessel was cooled to the test temperature
to induce hydrate formation. During this period, a pressure drop was
observed along with a temperature spike which meant that a large amount
of gas was consumed and a lot of heat was released, indicating that
R134a hydrates were formed in large quantities. After that, the hydrate
formation was considered to be finished when the vessel temperature
and pressure decreased at rates of <0.1 K h–1 and <0.01 MPa h–1, respectively.

In this
work, cyclic hydrate formation was studied in the SDS solution system
and SDS solution with a porous medium system. The process of cyclic
hydrate formation was defined as follows: the first-formed hydrates
at the test temperature were dissociated using thermal stimulation,
and then the vessel was cooled to the same test temperature to start
the second hydrate formation. This process was repeated several times
to complete the cyclic hydrate formation process. The process of cyclic
hydrate formation was performed under closed conditions (the vessel
was kept closed during cyclic hydrate formation and decomposition
and no gas and liquid were discharged). In this study, the storage
period of dissociated solution in the vessel was kept the same (200
min) at 17 °C. The storage period of dissociated solution was
defined as the period between the end of hydrate dissociation and
the start of hydrate reformation. Uchida et al. have found that the
storage period of 200 min is most conducive to the hydrate reformation.24,56 The test temperatures of hydrate formation were 1, 3, and 5 °C.

2.2.2 Hydrate Dissociation
2.2.2.1 Hydrate
Dissociation Using Single Thermal
Stimulation
After hydrate formation was completed at different
test temperatures, the vessel temperature was adjusted back to 17
°C under the closed condition until the R134a hydrates decomposed
completely (pressure difference <0.01 MPa h–1).

2.2.2.2 Hydrate Dissociation Using Thermal Stimulation
Combined with Depressurization
After hydrate formation at
1 °C, hydrate dissociation using thermal stimulation combined
with depressurization was conducted. Prior to the combined dissociation,
the backpressure pipe needed to be purified with R134a gas three times.
The temperature and pressure in the vessel were at the phase equilibrium
point (1 °C and 0.05 MPa12) before
the combined dissociation. The pressure was lower than atmospheric
pressure. Therefore, during the combined dissociation, the thermostatic
bath temperature was set at 17 °C. When the vessel temperature
was 7 °C (the vessel pressure was higher than atmospheric pressure
to avoid the backflow of gas into the vessel), the backpressure regulator
was opened at this time to perform the combined dissociation. The
dissociation was considered to be finished when no gas was discharged
from the backpressure equipment, and the temperature and pressure
in the vessel had stabilized (pressure decrease <0.01 MPa h–1).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 R134a Hydrate Formation
Characteristics
3.1.1 Extremely Slow Hydrate
Formation in the
Pure Water System
The typical formation of R134a hydrates
in pure water is revealed by the pressure–temperature–time
(P–T–t) plots in Figure 2. The corresponding formation images are shown in Figure 3. The whole formation process
was sustained for 19 days, and the hydrate morphology was peculiar.
During R134a hydrate formation, R134a liquefaction was recorded at
32 min. The liquid R134a clumped together on the surface of the water
and sank to the bottom as a droplet because the liquid R134a was denser
than water. After the vessel had cooled down to the test temperature,
the temperature was kept almost stable at 1 °C, and the pressure
very slowly decreased within the next 19 days, indicating continuous
and slow R134a hydrate formation. During the process of hydrate formation,
hydrates were formed from the gas–liquid interface toward water
and gradually grew as time went on. At 4.53 h, dendritic hydrates
germinated at the inner surface of the vessel and the gas–water
interface that produced an armor effect (a film-like layer of solid
hydrates formed at the gas–liquid interface57). Approximately 1 day later, there was a cluster of hydrates
formed from the water surface to the water center. The hydrate cluster
gradually increased and extended into the water phase over the next
1.22 days. From 2.44 to 3 days, there were many loose hydrates around
the hydrate cluster. Although the hydrate morphology change was inconspicuous
after 12 days, hydrates were forming at all times.

Figure 2 Pressure and temperature
histories during hydrate formation in
the pure water system.

Figure 3 R134a hydrate formation morphology in the pure water system.

The extremely slow hydrate formation
was attributed to the smaller
contact area of water and R134a. Although R134a liquefaction increased
the contact area, it could not effectively promote the formation of
hydrates. Meanwhile, the hydrate film at the gas–liquid interface
impeded the gas–liquid contact. In addition, the gradually
thickening hydrate film in the process of hydrate formation prevented
the R134a gas from diffusing into the aqueous phase, further hindering
hydrate formation. On the basis of the P–T–t outlines and images, most hydrate
formation locations are in the water phase, and the hydrate formation
duration lasts 19 days, which is too long for cold storage applications.

3.1.2 Fast Hydrate Formation in the SDS Solution
System
To shorten the R134a hydrate formation time, SDS was
added to the pure water system to cause the hydrate film to become
rough, soft, or to break to promote hydrate formation. The R134a hydrate
formation P–T–t plots and images in the 300 ppm SDS solution system are
shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. On the whole, the full time of hydrate
formation was approximately 140 min, which was significantly shorter
than that in the pure water system, indicating that the effect of
the surfactant, SDS, on enhancing the rate of hydrate formation was
notable. According to the observations, the same R134a liquefaction
was recorded in the SDS solution system. However, there was a significant
difference due to the presence of SDS for the hydrate formation morphology.
At 88 min, R134a hydrates rapidly formed along the vessel window.
From 88 to 94 min, flocculent hydrates were formed and gathered into
a cluster in the solution phase and increased gradually along the
direction from the solution surface to the bottom. Between 94 and
140 min, the hydrates continued to form and settle toward the bottom
and took on a completely formed morphology at 140 min. Meanwhile,
the P–T–t outline shows a temperature peak that corresponds to a steep pressure
descent from 88 to 140 min, indicating that R134a hydrates had formed
in a certain quantity that was accompanied by gas consumption, which
gave off much heat due to the large phase change heat of hydrates
(358 kJ/kg13).

Figure 4 Pressure and liquid temperature
histories during hydrate formation
in the SDS solution system.

Figure 5 R134a hydrate formation morphology in the SDS solution system.

Compared with the formation process
of R134a hydrates in the pure
water system, the role of SDS in the solution was to destroy the hydrate
film so that the R134a gas in the upper vessel remained in contact
with the water phase until the hydrates had completely formed. That
is, SDS could indirectly increase the gas–liquid contact area.
The result of hydrate formation in the SDS solution shows a rapidly
elapsed time. Therefore, the SDS solution system has an application
value for R134a hydrate cold storage compared with the pure water
system. However, according to the observations, the low hydrate density
caused by the flocculent hydrates will restrict the application of
hydrate cold storage, and the production of a hydrate slurry or the
addition of a polymerization accelerant may solve such problems.

3.2 Cyclic R134a Hydrate Formation Stability
As previously discussed, SDS can significantly promote the formation
of hydrates. Porous media have a special function that shortens the
induction time in hydrate reformation. Therefore, the roles of SDS
and a porous medium in cyclic hydrate reformation need to be discussed.
A total of six groups of experiments were performed in this section,
in which three groups were in the SDS solution system (without a porous
medium) and the other groups were in the SDS solution with a porous
medium system. The hydrate formation temperatures (test temperature)
of each of the three groups were 1, 3, and 5 °C. In each group,
cyclic hydrate formation was performed, including one first formation
and four reformations under closed conditions. The experimental parameters
are shown in Table 1.

The induction time, tind, of gas hydrate
formation is an evaluation parameter for the working medium cold storage
efficiency and indicates the duration time of the total system kept
in the hydrate formation environment (low temperature and high pressure).
In addition, both time and energy costs are associated with the induction
time, and the shorter the induction time is, lower are the time and
energy costs, which is beneficial to the cold storage system, and
vice versa. Meanwhile, this article evaluated the timeliness of the
hydrate formation environment by the energy consumption time ratio
(rECT), which is defined as follows 1   2  where ta is the
time when the system reaches phase equilibrium in cooling; tb is the time corresponding to the end of supercooling
(hydrate nucleation); and tfull is the
full time of hydrate formation from before the temperature fall to
the completely formed point, which are marked in Figure 4.

The average value (E(tind)) and standard difference
(σ) were used to evaluate the central
tendency and dispersion degree of the reformation induction time to
judge the cyclic hydrate reformation stability under different conditions. 3   4  where N is the exp. group
of hydrate formation, and Ni is the exp. no (i = 2, 3, 4, and 5).

3.2.1 Cyclic R134a Hydrate
Formation in the SDS
Solution System
Figure 6 shows the curves of the temperature and pressure of
cyclic hydrate formation in the SDS solution system. The effects of
the test temperatures (1, 3, and 5 °C) are discussed in detail,
and the experimental parameters and results are shown in Table 2. First, it appeared
that R134a hydrates formed in a relatively short time at all test
temperatures. In each hydrate formation episode, there was a temperature
peak when the pressure dropped sharply at the same time, and these
temperature peaks were dispersed. In contrast, the temperature peaks
at 5 °C were relatively low because less heat was released during
hydrate formation and the temperature decreased when the amount of
heat released was less than the cold input from outside.

Figure 6 Changes in
the temperature and pressure over time during cyclic
hydrate formation at different test temperatures in the SDS solution
system (A: 1 °C, B: 3 °C, and C: 5 °C).

The corresponding experimental results of the different
test temperatures
were discrepant. At 1, 3, and 5 °C, with the same initial temperature
and pressure of 17 °C and 0.49 MPa, respectively, the final pressures
after hydrate formation were lower than atmospheric pressure at 1
and 3 °C, but that at 5 °C was higher than atmospheric pressure.
The pressures before reformation that corresponded to the pressures
after the closed dissociation were all lower than the initial pressure.
That is, some R134a gas exists in the water phase in some form after
hydrate dissociation. Because of the short standing time, the existing
gas in the water phase before reformation cannot completely strip
the water phase.56 The stored gas would
promote hydrate reformation.58 Combining Figure 6 and Table 2, it can be found that the induction
time at the 1 °C test temperature in the first formation was
shorter than those at 3 and 5 °C. Meanwhile, the reformation
induction times (A3, C2, and C5) at 1 and 5 °C were longer than
the first formation induction time, and the reformation induction
time was chaotic at all test temperatures in the SDS solution system,
which implied that the memory effect that could promote hydrate reformation
did not always play a notable role every time.59 The reason may be that the gas presented an uneven distribution
in the SDS solution after hydrate dissociation, resulting in the dispersion
of temperature peaks in the cyclic hydrate reformation.

3.2.2 Cyclic R134a Hydrate Formation in the SDS
Solution with a Porous Medium System
The results presented
by the SDS solution with a porous medium system were different from
those without the porous medium. Figure 7 shows the outlines of the temperature and
pressure during cyclic hydrate formation in the SDS solution with
a porous medium system. There is no first formation at 5 °C in Figure 7C. Three repeat experiments
for the first hydrate formation at 5 °C are shown in Figure S1
in the Supporting Information. It was found
that the time of the supercooling stage was longer than one day for
hydrate formation at 5 °C, which was longer than 2000 min. Therefore,
the first hydrate formation at 5 °C was induced by a temperature
shock in which the temperature of the vessel was set to 17 °C
again at the supercooling stage and then cooled again to 5 °C
to achieve the first hydrate formation.

Figure 7 Changes in the temperature
and pressure over time during cyclic
hydrate formation at different temperatures in the SDS solution with
a porous medium system (A: 1 °C, B: 3 °C, and C: 5 °C).

As was discussed for the temperature
peak, the distributional difference
between the first formation and reformation was distinct. For all
test temperatures, the occurrence times of the temperature peaks at
first formation were longer than those of the reformations. As shown
in Figure 7 and Table 2, the induction time
at first formation gradually increased with increasing test temperature,
indicating that the low temperature was beneficial for promoting first
hydrate formation. In addition, relative to the SDS solution system,
the induction time at first formation in the SDS solution with a porous
medium system was longer, showing that the porous medium did not promote
or even inhibit the first hydrate formation. However, the induction
times of hydrate reformation were maintained within 40 min, which
were shorter than that of the first formation at all test temperatures,
and the full times at reformation were shorter than 150 min. These
results verified that cyclic hydrate reformation in the presence of
porous media was more stable than in the absence of porous media.
Meanwhile, it was found that the pressures before the reformation
that corresponded to the pressures after the closed dissociation were
all lower than the initial pressure, which was the same as that in
the SDS solution system. However, the SDS solution with the porous
medium system was more stable during cyclic hydrate reformation because
of the additional role of the porous medium. The additional role can
be summarized as follows: the porous medium could distribute the stored
gas in the aqueous phase in a relatively uniform manner, and the larger
specific surface area of the porous medium provided a larger gas–liquid
contact area for the hydrate reformation.

3.2.3 Cyclic
R134a Hydrate Formation Stability
Assessment
To further evaluate the cyclic hydrate formation
stability in the different systems, the rECT values in the first formation and reformations were calculated and
compared. Figure 8 shows
the trend of the first formation rECT in
the presence of porous media. Figure 9 presents the trend of the reformation rECT under different conditions. As shown in Figure 8, in the case of first hydrate
formation with a porous medium at 5 °C, rECT = 1. The induction time (>2000 min) of the first formation
was too long (as shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), so that the difference between the induction
time and full time was pretty small. In order to conduct the hydrate
reformation at 5 °C, the first formation of hydrate was achieved
by temperature shock after a long period of supercooling stage. The
induction time and full time may last longer and be more similar without
a temperature shock, which is going to make rECT approach 1.

Figure 8 Comparison of the first formation rECT with or without porous media.

Figure 9 Comparison of the cyclic hydrate reformation rECT under different conditions. (a) Single rECT; (b) total rECT.

Because of the diverse test temperatures
and experimental materials,
there were different rECT trends. In the
SDS solution system, the first formation rECT at 1 °C was lower than those at 3 and 5 °C. In the SDS
solution with and without a porous medium system, the first formation rECT gradually increased with increasing test
temperature. Comparing the different experimental materials, the first
formation rECT in the presence of porous
media was higher than that in the absence of porous media at every
test temperature. These results indicated that a higher test temperature
and the presence of a porous medium would increase the time and energy
costs of first formation, and the lower the temperature was, the lower rECT would be in terms of the overall performance.

The reformation rECT differed from
that of the first formation. As shown in Figure 9a, the rECT of
a single reformation fluctuated significantly in cases A–C
and peaked at 0.7484 in C2. In the cases of D–F, the rECT values during cyclic reformation were much
more stable and maintained below 0.35. For the cyclic reformation
process in Figure 9b, the total rECT in cases A–C
was greater than those in cases D–F. Although the total rECT of B was not very different from those of
D and E, its single reformation rECT fluctuated
significantly. Hence, the above results show that the single rECT was more uniform and the total rECT in the presence of porous media was smaller during
cyclic reformation.

The average value and standard deviation
of the reformation induction
time under different conditions were calculated, as shown in Figure 10. Overall, the
average value and standard deviation in case C were much larger than
those of the other cases, and the average values and standard deviations
in cases D–F were both smaller than those in cases A–C.
In particular, the standard deviations in cases D–F were 1
order of magnitude smaller. Therefore, the average values in cases
D–F were smaller, and the dispersion degree around the average
value was lower.

Figure 10 Comparison of the average value and standard deviation
of the reformation
induction time under different conditions.

Overall, at first formation, the time cost and energy cost
of the
system without a porous medium was lower than those with a porous
medium. However, in the process of cyclic reformation, based on not
only the stability of the single rECT and
the total rECT but also the central tendency
and dispersion degree in reformation induction time, the SDS solution
with a porous medium system was more applicable to cold storage systems.

3.3 R134a Hydrate Dissociation Characteristics
3.3.1 Hydrate Dissociation Characteristics Using
Single Thermal Stimulation
Six experiments were carried out
to investigate the R134a hydrate dissociation characteristics under
different hydrate formation conditions. Figure 11 shows the temperature variation during
dissociation by thermal stimulation. The heat absorbed by hydrate
decomposition dominated the temperature change in the vessel. At the
beginning of dissociation, the smaller amount of heat required for
hydrate dissociation would not affect the temperature rise in the
vessel. When the temperature in the vessel increased to 11–14
°C, the hydrates decomposed in large quantities, resulting in
the hydrates absorbing the sensible heat of the system to supplement
its own decomposition. The temperature would no longer rise or even
fall, which was called temperature buffering. The same mechanism of
temperature buffering was proposed by Chong et al.45 In the presence of porous media, temperature buffering
lasted longer, reaching approximately 50 min, whereas the buffering
lasted only approximately 20 min in the absence of porous media. It
can be concluded that the presence of porous media impedes the transfer
of heat, so the time of temperature buffering in the SDS solution
with a porous medium system was longer. In addition, the full decomposition
stage was slower than that of the system without a porous medium due
to the presence of the porous medium, which increased the hydrate
dissociation time.

Figure 11 Temperature variation with respect to time after thermal
stimulation
dissociation under different formation conditions.

3.3.2 Hydrate Dissociation
Characteristics Using
Thermal Stimulation Combined with Depressurization
As mentioned
before, the stability of cyclic hydrate formation in the SDS solution
with a porous medium system was higher, but the dissociation rate
was not as high as that of the SDS solution system. To shorten the
dissociation time, thermal stimulation combined with depressurization
was performed to promote hydrate dissociation in the SDS solution
with a porous medium system.

Figure 12 shows the variations in the temperature
and pressure in the combined dissociation. Temperature buffering was
also found in the combined dissociation. The time and temperature
range during temperature buffering varied due to the different backpressures—0.1,
0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 MPa. As shown in Figure 12a, the same range of temperature buffering
occurred for the combined dissociation at 0.4 MPa, and that of the
thermal stimulation dissociation was 12–14 °C. The difference
was that the time range of the 0.4 MPa backpressure dissociation occurred
slightly earlier (at 200 min). After hydrate formation at 1 °C,
the pressure in the vessel was negative after hydrate formation. To
eliminate the influence of negative pressure, when the temperature
rose to 7 °C during the combined dissociation, the backpressure
regulator was opened. Therefore, temperature buffering occurred immediately
after the backpressure regulator was opened during the combined dissociation
at 0.1 MPa, and the sharp decrease in pressure was accompanied by
a temperature drop. The temperature buffering during the combined
dissociation at 0.1 MPa lasted 70–110 min, with a temperature
range of 5–7 °C. However, the temperature buffering during
the combined dissociations at 0.2 and 0.3 MPa occurred at 150 and
175 min, respectively. Therefore, the time range of temperature buffering
gradually advanced with a decrease in the backpressure, the temperature
stage decreased, and the dissociation time was shortened. At 0.1 MPa
backpressure, the dissociation time could be reduced by 150 min.

Figure 12 Changes
in temperature and pressure over time during thermal stimulation
combined with depressurization dissociation. (a) Temperature curve
during the combined dissociation; (b) pressure curve during the combined
dissociation.

The common drivers of
the pressure and temperature during the combined
dissociation enabled the hydrates to decompose faster, which accelerated
the decomposition rate of the hydrates. As a result, the hydrate dissociation
time could be notably shortened. That is, the cold discharge efficiency
can be improved by thermal stimulation combined with depressurization,
and the lower the backpressure is, shorter is the hydrate dissociation
time.

4 Conclusions
The
cyclic hydrate formation stability and dissociation characteristics
of R134a hydrates were investigated using different systems. In the
study of the hydrate formation characteristics, it is found that the
destruction of the hydrate film can accelerate the formation of hydrates,
and the water phase can be rapidly filled with hydrate clusters to
complete hydrate formation rapidly under the action of SDS. In cyclic
hydrate formation, a high test temperature and the presence of a porous
medium would increase the time and energy costs of first hydrate formation.
However, the porous medium could distribute the stored gas evenly
to the liquid phase and provide a larger contact area during cyclic
hydrate reformation, which would result in induction times of hydrate
reformation of within 40 min and full times of hydrate reformation
that are shorter than 150 min. In addition, through the calculation
and comparison of rECT, the average value
and the dispersion degree verified that cyclic hydrate reformation
in the presence of a porous medium was more stable than that in the
absence of a porous medium.

For the cold discharge stage, the
hydrate dissociation time of
the SDS solution system was shorter than that of the SDS solution
with a porous medium system. In addition, a temperature buffering
process would be generated within 11–14 °C during the
thermal stimulation dissociation process. In the combined dissociation,
temperature buffering occurred earlier, and different backpressures
corresponded to various temperature buffering ranges. With the decrease
in backpressure, the hydrate dissociation time became shorter. Hydrate
dissociation can be completed faster by the driving forces of both
the temperature and pressure, resulting in a reduction in the dissociation
time by 150 min at a backpressure of 0.1 MPa. The findings of this
study can provide some insight for designing and implementing optimal
industrial applications for the use of hydrate cold storage.
