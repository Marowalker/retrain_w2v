High transparency
in the visible region is desired to manufacture
solar control films and glasses for various applications. To improve
the visible light transparency of LaB6 nanoparticles which
exhibit strong absorption in the near-infrared region, the substitution
of La with Ca is investigated using first-principles calculations.
Among the numerous atomic replacement configurations in CaxLa1–xB6, all 762 structures existing in the supercells that are up to 8
times the primitive cell are comprehensively evaluated, and the most
stable ground structures in CaxLa1–xB6 are deduced. The optical
properties of the ground structures are derived by performing high-precision
calculations using the HSE06 functional, which reveal that CaxLa1–xB6 with 0 < x < 1/4 is preferred as a
solar shielding material with improved visible transparency. This
method is effective for the investigation of the effect of substitutional
elements in composite compounds on their physical properties.

Introduction
Lanthanoid metal hexaboride, RB6, possesses unique physical
properties such as high conductivity, high hardness, and superconductivity.1 In particular, LaB6 has been studied
extensively as a thermionic emission material owing to its low work
function and high melting temperature.2 Recently, it was found that the nanoparticles of LaB6 produce a strong absorption in the near-infrared region coupled
with high transparency in the visible light region.3 This allowed its application in solar control films and
glasses, including automotive monolithic, laminated, and polycarbonate
glasses, and extended applications in laser welding and cancer therapies
employing their efficient photothermal conversion capabilities.4−13

The near-infrared absorption of LaB6-dispersed
layers
occurs with a strong dependence on the particle size and does not
occur at a micron scale.10 Its absorption
energy agrees with the plasmon energy (1.3 eV) measured using electron
energy-loss spectroscopy.8 These observations
confirm that the near-infrared absorption of LaB6 fine
particles is caused by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
of free electrons, similar to Ag, Au, and ITO (In2O3;Sn) fine particles.

However, the visible light transparency
of LaB6 is not
as high as the transparent conductive material of ITO and the nearly
transparent plasmonic material of Cs0.33WO3,
owing to a strong green tint caused by an absorption in the visible
region. If the visible light transparency of LaB6 is increased,
the tint neutralization and adjustment using color pigments in glass
processing can be made easier, and a high near-infrared absorption
can be realized at a given visible light transmittance to save energy
consumption.

One of the techniques for improving visible light
transparency
is elemental substitution. A few studies have been reported to control
the plasma resonance wavelength of LaB6 by elemental substitution.14−17 Bao et al. synthesized the alloys of SmxLa1–xB6 and EuxLa1–xB6, in which La was replaced by Sm and Eu, respectively, in
LaB6, and reported that the plasmon resonance wavelength
shifted toward a longer wavelength.15,16 However, these
results indicate that the absorption in the visible region also increases
and is not suitable for solar shielding applications because both
high visible transparency and strong near-infrared absorption are
simultaneously required. Mattox et al. also reported the results for
Eu-doped LaxEu1–xB6 containing B vacancies.17 The red shift of the plasma resonance wavelength and the decrease
in the visible absorption were the same as those reported by Bao et
al. and did not improve the solar control properties.

Thus,
the previously reported studies were limited to LaB6 with
the replacement of La by other lanthanoid elements, where the
wavelength control of the plasmon resonance was only toward the long
wavelength and the transparency in the visible region was impaired.
However, developments that lead to a true improvement in the optical
characteristics, that is, a concurrent increase in the visible transparency
and near-infrared absorption, has not yet been reported. Therefore,
in this study, a detailed investigation of the visible light transparency
of LaB6 is conducted using first-principles calculations.

It has been previously reported by our research group that the
dielectric functions that determine the optical properties of LaB6 can be predicted with high accuracy by first-principles calculations.18 The optical properties of nanoparticle dispersions
are analyzed by the dielectric functions and Mie scattering theory,
but when the particle shape and dielectric functions are modulated
during the nanoparticle formation, as in the case of LaB6,12,19 a new analysis method such as the Mie scattering
integration (MSI) method is used to describe the optical response.
The MSI method integrates the individual Mie scattering waves from
particles with inhomogeneous physical properties and/or shapes in
an ensemble.12,20,21

The visible transparency of LaB6 was also analyzed
recently,18 and it was found to be essentially
derived from
the wide-gap band structure and reduced transition probability because
of the selection rule that prohibits transitions from the B-p orbital
in the valence band to the B-p and La-p orbitals in the conduction
band. The spectral blue-side transmission is restricted by the band-edge
absorption and the red-side transmission is strongly affected by the
LSPR wavelength. Therefore, a wide-gap band structure and low plasma
frequency are the requisites for a replacement material for LaB6. In this study, the substitution of La with divalent ions,
specifically, alkaline earth metals, is investigated. Alkaline earth
metal hexaborides such as CaB6, SrB6, and BaB6 are wide-gap semiconductors/insulators and are isomorphic
with LaB6. The electronic structures of CaB6, SrB6, and BaB622−24 are reported in prior
literature reports, but no detailed studies including the dielectric
functions have been published. Therefore, high-accuracy calculations
of the optical properties of CaB6, SrB6, and
BaB6 were performed to determine the candidate substitution
element, and the effects of the elemental substitution in LaB6 at various proportions were examined.

To precisely
determine the absorption of the substituted material
in the visible region, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate
the effect of interband transitions. However, in a ternary compound
in which a portion of La atoms is replaced by another element, the
energy and electronic state of the compound strongly depend on the
positional relationship between the substituted and matrix elements,
and correspondingly different optical characteristics are observed.
In the literature, first-principles calculations of several substituted
hexaborides have been reported, such as La0.875Sm0.125B615 and Ca0.325La0.625B6,25 but
these do not incorporate the various substitutional configurations
and calculate only a single type of replacement arrangement. The calculations
with only a limited type of arrangement do not afford a satisfactory
prediction for the experiments. In the present study, a comprehensive
and exhaustive approach is used for the arrangement of elements, and
the lowest-energy ground structures of LaB6 with the substitution
of La by an alkali earth element at various proportions are identified.
Furthermore, the changes in the optical properties with variations
in the ground structures are analyzed in detail, and the optical properties
of the actual nanoparticle ensembles are inspected.

Results and Discussion
The crystal structure of LaB6 is shown in Figure 1. LaB6 has a CsCl-type
simple cubic crystal structure, where a = b = c and α = β = γ =
90°. The space group belongs to Pm3̅m, consisting of La at the Cs position and B6 octahedral cluster at the Cl position. Similarly, CaB6 has a CsCl-type simple cubic crystal structure in which La is replaced
by Ca.

Figure 1 Crystal structure of LaB6.

A previous study reported by our research group shows that the
optical characteristics of LaB6 can be reproduced quantitatively
by considering the Drude term, which includes the effect of free electrons,
and by calculating the effect of interband transitions using a hybrid
calculation method that accurately reproduces the band gap.18 Details are described in the Methods section.

The structures of CaB6,
SrB6, and BaB6 are represented in Figure 1, where La is replaced by Ca,
Sr, and Ba. Figure 2 shows the results
of the calculation of the dielectric functions of LaB6,
CaB6, SrB6, and BaB6. Focusing on
the imaginary part of the dielectric function, LaB6 shows
a small absorption in the visible region and a large absorption in
the low-energy region below 1.8eV, which makes it suitable for application
as a solar radiation shielding material.

Figure 2 Dielectric functions
of LaB6 and XB6 (X =
Ca, Sr, Ba) derived from first-principles calculations using VASP
with a HSE06 hybrid functional.

Considering the ε2 values for CaB6,
SrB6, and BaB6, the substitution of trivalent
La with a divalent alkaline earth metal reduces the free electrons
and significantly decreases the absorption in the low-energy side
derived from the Drude term. Considering the energy at which ε1(ω) = 0, which determines the screened plasma resonance
frequency (Ωsp), the Ωsp values
of BaB6, SrB6, and CaB6 are all significantly
lower than that of LaB6, that is, BaB6, SrB6, and CaB6 are not expected to absorb near infrared
light. In contrast, ε2 value in the visible energy
is high for BaB6 and decreases for SrB6 and
CaB6 in this order. Therefore, CaB6 was selected
as a substitution material for LaB6.

Next, the effect
of Ca substitution of La in CaxLa1–xB6 was examined
in detail. Figure 3 shows the convex hull and the mixing energy of each structure of
CaxLa1–xB6 obtained by the first-principles calculations, where
the energies of LaB6 and CaB6 are set at 0 eV.
For each x of CaxLa1–xB6, the energies of the
possible configurations vary significantly depending on the difference
in the substitution sites, that is, the difference in the microscopic
crystal structure. The convex hull that traces the envelope of the
lowest energies includes all energies of the most stable states of
CaxLa1–xB6.

Figure 3 Results of energy calculations of 762 substitutional configurations
showing convex hull in CaxLa1–xB6.

In addition to LaB6 and CaB6, six compositions
are found as the ground states that constitute the most stable state
of CaxLa1–xB6. These include CaLa7B48 (x = 1/8), CaLa5B36 (x = 1/6), Ca2La6B48 (x = 1/4), Ca3La3B36 (x = 1/2), Ca3LaB24 (x = 3/4), and Ca7LaB48 (x =
7/8). The integer corresponds to the number of atoms contained in
the calculated unit cell. The most stable state of CaxLa1–xB6 is composed of these eight types of structures.

In other words,
LaB6 and CaLa7B48 coexist when the
Ca substitutional fraction x is
in the range of 0 < x < 1/8, and CaLa7B48 and CaLa5B36 coexist in the
range of 1/8 < x < 1/6. In the range of 1/6
< x < 1/4, CaLa5B36 and
Ca3La3B36 coexist, whereas in the
range of 1/2 < x < 3/4, Ca3La3B36 and Ca3LaB24 coexist.
Furthermore, Ca3LaB24 and Ca7LaB48 coexist in the range of 3/4 < x <
7/8, and in the range of 7/8 < x < 1, a mixed
state including Ca7LaB48 and CaB6 can be realized.

At finite temperatures, structures other
than the ground-state
structures can be realized considering the mixing energies being on
the order of room temperature, but it is still important to examine
the ground-state structures in detail. The six ground structures excluding
the terminal structures are shown in Figure 4. For simplification, only the atoms for
the La site are shown, and the B6 cluster is not drawn. Figure 4a shows a structure
in which 1/8 La atoms are replaced by Ca in a supercell that is 8
times as that of LaB6, and Ca is arranged continuously
in the c-axis direction. A structure in which 1/6
La atoms are replaced by Ca is shown in Figure 4b. Ca is not present at the nearest La site.
In the structure in Figure 4c, 1/4 La atoms are replaced by Ca. Two Ca atoms are connected
in the c-axis direction in a manner similar to that
shown in Figure 4a. Figure 4d shows a structure
in which a half of La atoms are replaced by Ca, where La and Ca are
clustered in the separated regions. Figure 4e,f shows structures in which 3/4 and 7/8
La atoms, respectively, are replaced by Ca atoms. These atomic configurations
are opposite to those in Figure 4a,c, where La is placed apart instead of Ca. Thus,
the Ca substitution site in the most stable structure varies considerably
depending on the fraction of Ca substitution. Figure 4 shows that Ca atoms tend to locate close
to each other. This could cause a local bias in charge, but because
the large anion of the B62– cluster forms
a strong network of sublattice and shields the influence of charge
bias, the structure stays stable. The tendency of Ca to cluster is
thought to be because of the different electronic behaviors of La
and Ca in the B6 sublattice. The shielding of the local
charge is confirmed in the small absolute values of mixing energies,
as shown in Figure 3.

Ca3LaB24, and (f) Ca7LaB48. The boron sublattice is not drawn for clarity.

The changes in the plasma frequencies and dielectric functions
of CaB6, LaB6, and the six structures constituting
the most stable state were also examined in detail. Table 1 shows the changes in plasma
frequencies of these structures. The plasma frequency was found anisotropic;
thus, the values in the x, y, and z directions as well as the averages are listed. Because
trivalent La is substituted by divalent Ca in CaxLa1–xB6, it is
expected that the number of free electrons and plasma frequency decrease
with increasing Ca content in a simple random substitution model.
Thus, the plasma frequency of CaB6 is close to 0 eV. However,
the data included in Table 1 show that the changes in plasma frequencies upon the variation
of x are not uniform. For example, the largest plasma
frequency is 4.01 eV for Ca2La6B48. Furthermore, anisotropy is particularly prominent in CaLa7B48 and CaLa5B36. CaLa7B48 includes the substitution of 1/8 La atoms, and the
plasma frequencies in the x, y,
and z directions are 0.0, 0.0, and 4.3 eV, respectively,
that is, the free electrons can move in the z direction
but not in the x and y directions.

Figure 5 shows the
dielectric functions obtained for CaB6, LaB6, and the six ground structures. Here, the averaged values in the x, y, and z directions
are shown. LaB6 and CaB6 are represented by
blue and gray lines, respectively. In terms of ε2(ω), LaB6 absorbs weakly in the visible light region,
and a high absorption is observed in the low-energy side including
the near-infrared region. These characteristics are consistent with
the measurements3,8,10 and
calculated values18 reported in previous
studies. For applications as a solar shielding material, ε2(ω) should have a large value in the near-infrared region
and a small value in the visible region. Replacing a whole La with
Ca significantly reduces the free electrons and accordingly decreases
the optical absorption in the near-infrared region.

Figure 5 (a) Real and (b) imaginary
parts of the calculated dielectric functions
of the ground structures in CaxLa1–xB6. Crystal anisotropy
is ignored, and only the averaged profiles are shown.

The dielectric function of CaxLa1–xB6 does not show
a uniform
change with variation in the amount of Ca substitution, similar to
the trend observed for plasma frequency. Considering ε2(ω), the absorption in the visible region generally decreases
with an increase in the amount of Ca substitution, and the transparency
in the visible region tends to improve. However, the Ca2La6B48 and Ca3La3B36 compositions with 25 and 50% Ca substitution, respectively,
show higher absorptions in the visible region than LaB6, whereas Ca3LaB24 shows a weaker absorption
than Ca7LaB48. These phenomena originate from
the high anisotropy because of the Ca substitution configurations.

In the real part of the dielectric function, LaB6 has
ε1(ω) = 0 on the highest energy side among
the other compositions. This shows that Ωsps of CaxLa1–xB6 shifts toward lower energy in comparison to that of LaB6. However, the change in Ωsp is not uniform
with respect to the variation in Ca content, for example, the Ωsps values of Ca3LaB24 and Ca3La3B36 are located on the lower side than that
of Ca7LaB48. To obtain sufficient absorption
in the near-infrared region, the Ωsp value should
be approximately 1.3 eV of CaLa5B36 or greater
among those corresponding to the ground-state compositions. That is,
the compositions that can be employed as solar radiation shielding
materials are CaLa7B48, CaLa5B36, and Ca2La6B48. The range
of 0 < x < 1/4 for CaxLa1–xB6 is preferable
because the ε2 values of these compositions are small
in the visible range, which is an indication of high transparency
in the visible region. This study shows that even when La in LaB6 is substituted with a typical element such as Ca, the change
in optical properties is not uniform and varies significantly depending
on the substitution fraction and structure.

Next, to determine
the characteristics of actual nanoparticle dispersions,
the absorption efficiency was calculated using the Mie scattering
theory. The optical properties of the nanoparticle dispersions depend
on various factors, in particular, the particle shape, dielectric
function, and their ensemble inhomogeneities, which are known to have
a considerable influence on the optical response.12,19,20 For LaB6 nanoparticles, the absorption
band width has been shown to become 7 times as that of a single spherical
particle because of the effect of disk-shaped ensemble inhomogeneity.12 Lattice defects19 introduced during the preparation of nanoparticles are analyzed
to reduce the relaxation time and increase the base level of ε2, both of which cause their ensemble effects. However, the
ensemble inhomogeneity of nanoparticles was ignored in this study
as it is outside the scope of this report. An ideal uniform ensemble
of spherical particles with an average diameter of 20 nm was assumed,
and the absorption efficiency was calculated based on the dielectric
function of each structure. For cases where modifications are introduced
in the particle shape and/or dielectric function, the corresponding
experimental profiles can be predicted by the methods described in
refs.12,20,21

Figure 6a shows
the absorption efficiencies of LaB6, CaLa7B48, CaLa5B36, and Ca2La6B48. The plasma resonance wavelength shifts toward
a high wavelength, in agreement with the corresponding change in ε1(ω). This causes a simultaneous reduction in absorption
in the visible region in CaLa7B48 and CaLa5B36. On the other hand, almost no change is introduced
in the high-energy side where the band-edge transition is dominant.

Figure 6 (a) Absorption
efficiencies and (b) absorption efficiencies normalized
by LSPR absorption peak calculated using the Mie scattering theory
for LaB6, CaLa7B48, CaLa5B36, and Ca2La6B48 spherical
nanoparticles of size 20 nm.

Figure 6b shows
the absorption efficiency normalized by the near-infrared LSPR absorption.
The CaLa7B48 and CaLa5B36 nanoparticles show significantly enhanced transparencies at high
wavelengths in the visible region and intensified broad-band absorptions
in the near-infrared region. In comparison to LaB6, the
color tint and transparency significantly improve in addition to an
enhanced NIR absorption. The uniform ensemble of the spherical nanoparticles
assumed in the present analysis can be produced experimentally by
selecting an appropriate synthesis method. For deviations in the nonspherical
shape and high relaxation time accompanying ensemble inhomogeneity
that are likely introduced in the mechanical production process, the
plasmon absorption band should be peaked at the longer-wavelength
side with a broader full width at half-maximum, where the composition,
Ca2La6B48, could be an attractive
choice. For calculations, including the effects of nonspherical particle
shape, lattice defects, surface modifications, internal stress, and
their ensemble inhomogeneity effects, methods are detailed in the
previous researches.12,19−21

Conclusions
An alkaline-earth hexaboride was studied as a replacement material
to improve the transparency of LaB6, by first-principles
calculations, and CaB6 was selected. The most stable structures
of CaxLa1–xB6 among 762 substitutional configurations with
different compositions were comprehensively searched, and eight basic
ground structures were found. Examinations of the optical characteristics
of the ground structures using high-precision calculations revealed
that the influence of Ca substitution varied significantly, depending
on the substitutional positions and fractions, and the changes in
the optical characteristics were not uniform. It was determined that
in the range of 0 < x < 1/4 in CaxLa1–xB6, the transmittance in the visible light region improved while preserving
the plasmon absorption in the near-infrared region, whereas for x > 1/4, the plasmon absorption weakened and the relative
transmission in the visible region did not improve. Therefore, the
compositions with 0 < x < 1/4 in CaxLa1–xB6 were preferred as solar shielding materials. In general, the physical
properties of the substituted composite compounds are effectively
analyzed by using this approach, that is, the ground structures are
extracted by creating a convex hull through an exhaustive and comprehensive
evaluation of low-energy substitution configurations.

Methods
Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)26−29 was used for the first-principles
calculations. As the exchange–correlation functional, a hybrid
HSE06 functional30 that reproduced the
band gap with high accuracy was used.

The dielectric function
ε(ω) that determines the optical
characteristics is composed of the real part ε1(ω)
and imaginary part ε2(ω), as shown in eq 1, which are interrelated
through the Kramers–Krönig equation (eq 2). Thus, if ε2(ω)
can be obtained with high accuracy up to a high-energy region, ε(ω)
can be obtained by the relationship defined by the Kramers–Krönig
equation. 1   2  ε2(ω)
of the dielectric
function corresponds to the absorption of photons by electrons and
is composed of the Lorentz term, which is the contribution of the
interband transition shown in eq 3, and the Drude term, which is the contribution of free electrons. 3  where V is the unit cell
volume; c and v are subscripts indicating
the valence band and conduction band, respectively; E is the energy level; e is the unit
vector; u is the periodic part of the orbit; and wk is the weight of the k points.31

LaB6 is a conductor whose Fermi energy crosses the conduction
band. Therefore, in addition to the Lorentz term, ε2Lorentz(ω),
the Drude term is also required. Especially at low energies, the Drude
term becomes dominant over the Lorentz term, thereby dictating the
low-energy behaviors with the analytical expression of the Drude term.
The validity of this method has been confirmed by the excellent agreement
with the measured dielectric functions in LaB6, including
the low-energy region.18 The Drude term
can be written as eqs 5 and 6 using the plasma frequency ωp, shown in eq 4, and relaxation time τ = 1/γ. 4   5   6  where f is the Fermi–Dirac
distribution function, n is the free electron density, e is the charge of the electron, ε0 is
the permittivity of the vacuum, and m* is the effective
mass of the electron.32

The plasma
frequency can be obtained from the band structure using eq 4. The relaxation time τ
= 1/γ represents the scattering effect because of the electron–phonon,
electron–electron, and electron–lattice defect interactions;
however, the influence on the dielectric function because of the fluctuation
of γ is not very large,18 such that
we set ℏγ = 0.1 eV in this study.

An infinite number
of Ca-substituted configurations exist in the
CaxLa1–xB6 structure. The possible substitutional configurations
depend on the size of the supercell. Therefore, in this study, the
supercell size was increased stepwise; the LaB6 primitive
cell was doubled, tripled, and eventually expanded up to 8 times the
primitive cell. First-principles calculations were performed for all
762 structures of CaxLa1–xB6, which covered all the possible substitutional
configurations assumed in all supercells that were up to 8 times the
primitive cell and containing 56 atoms. In this step, the generalized
gradient approximation-Perdew–Burke-Ernzerhof functional was
used as the exchange–correlation functional. The crystal size,
shape, and atomic position were fully relaxed. The x-dependence of the most stable energy state of CaxLa1–xB6, that
is, the convex hull, was obtained, and the most stable structure at
each substitutional fraction x was identified. Thereafter,
for each of the most stable structures obtained, high-precision band
structure calculation using the HSE06 functional was performed to
derive the optical characteristics. For executing the automatic expansion
and replacement operations of the primitive cells, the cluster expansion
program ICET33 was used.
