Easily accessible 3,3′-diindolylmethanes
(DIMs) were utilized
to generate a focused library of indolo[2,3-b]quinolines
(2), chromeno[2,3-b]indoles (3), and 3-alkenyl-oxindoles (4) under 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone
(DDQ)-mediated oxidative conditions. DIMs with ortho-NHTosyl (NHTs)
phenyl group afforded indolo[2,3-b]quinolines (2), whereas DIMs with ortho-hydroxy phenyl groups yielded
chromeno[2,3-b]indoles (3) and 3-alkenyl-oxindoles
(4). The mild conditions and excellent yields of the
products make this method a good choice to access a diverse library
of bioactive molecules from a common starting material. Two optimized
compounds 2a and 2n displayed excellent
activity against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Compound 2a showed
the minimum inhibitory concentration values in the concentration between
1 and 4 μg/mL, whereas compound 2n revealed the
values of 1–2 μg/mL. Furthermore, both the compounds
were highly bactericidal and capable to kill the MRSA completely within
360 min. Collectively, the results suggested that both compounds 2a and 2n possess enormous potential to be developed
as anti-MRSA agents.

Introduction
3,3′-Diindolylmethane
(DIM), renowned for its anticancer
properties, is a metabolic product of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which
is a glucosinolate conjugate in various cruciferous vegetables.1 Formation of DIM under the physiological conditions
is considered as a prerequisite for the I3C-induced anticarcinogenesis.2 Given its biological significance, several methodologies
for the synthesis of DIMs have been reported.3 DIMs were also utilized as substrates in synthetic transformations
to access diverse molecular scaffolds that include synthesis of indolo[2,3-b]quinolines by a SnCl2·H2O-mediated
reductive intramolecular C–N bond formation,4 tetrahydroindolocarbazoles under acid-mediated conditions,5 and bis-indole alkaloid analogues by palladium
and gold catalysis.6 In addition, DIMs
were utilized as key intermediates in the synthesis of fluorene,7 azepinoindole,8 and
tetrahydrocarbazoles.9 The simplicity in
the generation of DIMs and also our continuous interest toward the
development of DIM conjugates of pharmacological relevance10 encouraged us to investigate its synthetic utility
as a promising substrate for indole-rich diverse molecular motifs.
A synthetic methodology that can build a diverse array of molecules
from the readily available starting materials or easily assembled
substrates is the need of the hour for generating a rapid library
of compounds in the drug discovery endeavors. In the present study,
we have explored DDQ-mediated oxidative transformations of 3,3′-diindolylphenylmethanes
(DIPMs, 1) generated from N-Ts-2-aminobenzaldehyde
and salicylaldehyde with various indoles. DDQ, which is readily available,
cheap, and ecofriendly reagent, mediated various intramolecular cyclizations
by means of C–C,11 C–N,12 C–O,13 and
C–S14 bond formations. We have readily
transformed DIPMs under DDQ-mediated oxidative conditions to indolo[2,3-b]quinolines 2 (Scheme 1), chromeno[2,3-b]indoles 3 (Scheme 2), and 3-alkenyl-oxindoles 4 (Scheme 3), which are found as the core structures
in natural products and drug targets (Figure 1).

Indolo[2,3-b]quinoline is a core structure in
perophoramidine and communesin alkaloids.15 6H-Indolo[2,3-b]quinoline and
its methylated analogue (neocryptolepine) are natural products, known
for their DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition properties.16 Recently, several neocryptolepine derivatives
were synthesized and their antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities
were explored.17 In general, most of the
analogues were active against Gram-positive bacteria and inactive
against Gram-negative bacteria. Similar antibacterial activity trend
was observed for other reported indolo[2,3-b]quinoline
derivatives.18 Owing to their biological
significance in medicinal chemistry research, several efficient methods
were reported for the synthesis of indolo[2,3-b]quinolines.16,19 The present method, however, is a highly efficient metal-free method
under oxidative condition, which facilitates the synthesis of a library
of indolo[2,3-b]quinolines under mild conditions
from the easily accessible DIPMs.

Chromeno[2,3-b]indole is a core structure in hyrtimomine
and goniomedine alkaloids.20 The current
available methods for the synthesis of chromeno[2,3-b]indole tetracycles include the intramolecular cyclizations of Knoevenagel
adducts and 2-phenoxy-3-indolecarboxylates, further facilitated by
POCl3.21 Recently, palladium-catalyzed
conditions were employed in a cascade reaction between 2-bromoindole
and salicylaldehyde.22 Owing to their limited
synthetic approaches, the biological evaluation of these molecules
is limited to in vitro antiproliferative activity.21a Our present method can afford chromeno[2,3-b]indole under mild conditions with a high yield.

The focused
library of these molecules was evaluated for their
selective anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (anti-MRSA) activity by screening against a
range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The zone of inhibition
assay suggested that indolo[2,3-b]quinolines 2a and 2n were highly active against S. aureus, which causes a wide range of clinical
infections. We have evaluated the anti-MRSA efficacy of these two
optimized compounds by performing the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) experiments. We
also performed the time-kill kinetics to understand the rate at which
compounds 2a and 2n are capable to kill
MRSA.

Results and Discussions
Synthesis
Our initial attempt of
treating DIPM 1A, prepared by the facile condensation
of ortho-NHTs benzaldehyde
and N-methylindole, with DDQ (1.5 equiv) using DCM
as the solvent afforded the expected indolo[2,3-b]quinoline 2b (Scheme 1) by the C2–N bond formation, but complete conversion
of the starting material was not observed. To our delight, an increase
in DDQ to 3 equiv afforded the desired product 2b in
100% yield (quantitative) either by using DCM or DMF solvents (entries
1 and 2, Table 1).
This reaction was unsuccessful in water, whereas a trace amount of 2b was observed even in the absence of DDQ at 110 °C
(entries 3 and 4, Table 1). The product formation was observed in the presence of other oxidants,
namely, phenyliodine diacetate (PIDA) and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN)
(entries 5–7, Table 1), albeit less yielding than DDQ.

We extended the scope of the present
method using DIPM 1A with differently substituted 1H-indoles and N-methylindoles (Scheme 1). DIPMs synthesized
using 1H-indole
and N-phenylindole underwent facile transformation
to the corresponding indolo[2,3-b]quinolines 2a and 2c in 89 and 92% yields, respectively.
The DIPMs with varied halogen and electron withdrawing group
(EWG)- or electron donating group (EDG)-substituted indoles underwent
DDQ-mediated transformation to furnish the respective products 2d–m and 2o–p in good to excellent yields. The DIPM with an OMe substitution
in the phenyl ring afforded indolo[2,3-b]quinoline 2n in 90% yield. Most of the indolo[2,3-b]quinoline derivatives that were screened for antimicrobial activity
possess a simple methyl substitution at the 11 position.17,18 In this context, the indolyl group at the 11 position appears as
a spectator substituent in the formation of indolo[2,3-b]quinoline 2; however, its presence in conjugation with
quinoline can bear far-stretched implications in the biological activity.

The aforementioned results encouraged us to further explore the
utility of DIPM 1B with ortho-hydroxy substitution in
the phenyl ring and 1H-indole under DDQ-mediated
optimized condition using DMF as the solvent (entry 2, Table 1), as DIPM 1B is
insoluble in DCM. As expected, we observed the formation of chromeno[2,3-b]indole 3a in 87% yield, confirmed by NMR
and single-crystal X-ray analyses (Scheme 2).23 DIPM 1B with differently substituted 1H-indoles
afforded the desired chromeno[2,3-b]indole 3b–h in excellent yields (Scheme 2). DIPM 1B with
mono- and disubstituted phenyl groups also afforded the desired products 3f and 3g in 87 and 76% yields, respectively.

DIPM 1C generated from N-methylindole
and salicylaldehyde under DDQ conditions, however, afforded an inseparable
mixture of products. The protection of hydroxyl group of the resulting
crude mixture with silyl protection (TBDMS) facilitated the separation
of the mixture, over column chromatography, which exhibited same mass
values as observed by the high-resolution mass spectrometry. Further,
NMR and single-crystal X-ray analyses confirmed the formation of a
geometrical mixture of 3-alkenyl-oxindoles 4 (Scheme 3).23 3-Alkenyl-oxindole is also a biologically relevant molecule
present in pharmaceuticals.24 The present
method of DDQ-mediated oxidative transformation of DIPMs to 3-alkenyl-oxindoles
can serve as an alternative to metal-mediated intramolecular cyclization
strategies.25 Various substituted DIPMs 1C were treated under DDQ-mediated oxidative conditions, which
furnished 3-alkenyl-oxindole products 4a, 4a′
to 4e, 4e′ and 4f in good
to excellent yields over two steps (Scheme 3). Based on the X-ray analysis of 4f and 4b′ and thin-layer chromatography (TLC),
compound 4 and 4′ series were identified
as Z (nonpolar) and E (polar) isomers, respectively. NMR of both the
isomers of 4a, 4a′ to 4e, 4e′ and 4f are separately mentioned
in the Supporting Information.

Antibacterial
Activity
Infections associated with multidrug-resistant
bacteria are increasing at an alarming rate, and these are untreatable
in some cases. To tackle this problem, chemical entities with new
structures and new targets are urgently required.26S. aureus-based infections
are increasingly difficult to treat due to the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which is resistant toward many
β-lactam antibiotics.27 Natural products
with novel scaffolds are undergoing clinical evaluation for producing
novel antibiotics in the drug discovery endeavors.28 Therefore, our aim is to identify such agents that will
display selective anti-MRSA activity without showing much activity
against other bacteria. Selective antibacterial agents will create
lesser resistance developing pressure in the bacterial, thereby holding
the antibacterial efficacy with sufficient longevity. To achieve this,
we set our goal to screen all of the synthesized compounds, namely,
indolo[2,3-b]quinolines (2) and chromeno[2,3-b]indoles (3), whose core structures are present
in natural products, along with 3-alkenyl-oxindoles (4), against an array of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
The preliminary antibacterial efficacy of compounds 2a–p, 3a–h and 4a–e, 4a′–e′, and 4f were investigated by performing the zone of
inhibition experiment against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria (Table 2).
The results suggested that indolo[2,3-b]quinolines
(2) and chromeno[2,3-b]indoles (3) were not effective against the inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi and 3-alkenyl-oxindoles
(4) were not inhibitory against any bacteria. Even though
chromeno[2,3-b]indoles 3a–c and 3f exhibited a broad-spectrum antibacterial
activity, indolo[2,3-b]quinolines 2a and 2n displayed more selectivity toward inhibiting S. aureus over other bacteria. The other compounds
in this class, such as 2b–d, 2g, 2i, 2k, 2m (with N-methylindoles or N-phenylindoles), 2e, 2f, 2h, 2j, 2l, and 2o (derived from differently substituted
1H-indoles), showed no inhibitory activity against S. aureus. The mechanism of action of compounds 2a and 2n is yet to be explored; however, it
was quite clear that the 6-OMe group present in compound 2n probably does not significantly affect binding to the target site,
therefore displaying similar zone of inhibition as that of compound 2a. In contrast, the other compounds in this series with diverse
functionalities probably prevent binding to its target, leading to
an inactiveness toward S. aureus, except
compound 2p, which showed a moderate zone of inhibition.

To investigate the anti-MRSA activity
of the most effective compounds 2a and 2n, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined against
four different methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (three of them were clinically isolated strains). One methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain was also included in this study
(Table 3). We have
not included any compound from chromeno[2,3-b]indole 3 series, as they displayed better efficacy against the other
bacteria over S. aureus, and herein
the goal was to identify selective anti-MRSA agents. Additionally,
various Gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were also included to verify
selective activity toward MRSA. To understand the efficacy of these
new compounds as anti-MRSA agents, the activity was compared with
the conventional antibiotic methicillin. The results suggested that
both compounds 2a and 2n displayed excellent
activity against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The antibiotic methicillin was active
against the susceptible bacterial strain with an MIC value of 1 μg/mL,
whereas it displayed very high values against all of the MRSA strains
(concentration ranging from 32 to >64 μg/mL), indicating
a high
level of methicillin resistance in them. In comparison, compounds 2a and 2n displayed similar activity against
both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacterial strains. Both compounds
displayed the MIC value of 1 μg/mL against the methicillin-susceptible
strain. For the MRSA strains, the MIC values varied in the concentration
of 1–4 μg/mL depending on the bacterial strains. Compounds 2a and 2n displayed the MBC values in the concentration
between 2 and 8 μg/mL, where methicillin displayed the value
of >64 μg/mL against all of the MRSA tested. More importantly,
both compounds were inactive against the Gram-negative bacteria and
did not display any activity against them even at 64 μg/mL.
Collectively, the results suggested that both compounds 2a and 2n are selective anti-MRSA agents that displayed
excellent activity toward MRSA over other bacteria.

Bactericidal Kinetics against MRSA
Further, anti-MRSA
efficacy of the compounds was investigated by performing the time-kill
kinetics. To understand the rate at which compounds 2a and 2n are capable to kill MRSA, the experiment was
performed at three different compound concentrations (4, 8, and 16
μg/mL). As shown in Figure 2, both compounds displayed bactericidal activity (>3
log reduction in cell viability). The rate of MRSA killing was highly
dependent on the compound concentration. Although, at a lower concentration
(4 μg/mL), both compounds displayed relatively slower kinetics;
faster kinetics was observed at a higher concentration of 16 μg/mL.
At this concentration, both compounds 2a and 2n were capable of killing MRSA completely within 360 min.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the broad
utility of DIPM substrates
under DDQ-mediated oxidative conditions to produce biologically relevant
molecules. DIPMs generated from N-methylindole or
1H-indole appended to ortho-NHTs phenyl group afforded
indolo[2,3-b]quinolines 2 in the presence
of DDQ. DIPMs with 1H-indole appended to ortho-hydroxy phenyl group afforded chromeno[2,3-b]indoles 3, whereas DIPMs with N-methylindole afforded 3-alkenyl-oxindoles 4 under the
DDQ-mediated conditions. All of the reactions were conducted in an
expeditious manner at room temperature under mild conditions, affording
the products in excellent yields. The antibacterial screening through
the zone of inhibition experiment resulted in two potent and selective
anti-MRSA agents. Further detailed studies suggested that compounds 2a and 2n were highly bactericidal and displayed
excellent MIC and MBC values at a lower concentration. Taken together,
this study paves the way to identify the lead compounds that possess
a high potential to be developed as anti-MRSA agents.

were purchased as reagent grade and used without further purification
and distillation. The reactions were monitored by TLC and the spots
were visualized by short/long wavelength UV lamp. 1H and 13C NMR were recorded at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using
CDCl3/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 as solvents and chemical shifts were given in parts per million.
Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel 100–200
mesh. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis
was performed using an orbitrap analyzer and the ions are given in m/z.

General Procedure for DDQ-Mediated
Synthesis of Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines 2 and Chromeno[2,3-b]indoles 3
To a solution of DIPM 1A/1B (0.1–0.5 mmol, 0.07
M) in DCM or DMF solvent was added DDQ
(3 equiv) at room temperature. After the completion of the starting
material, as indicated by TLC (<5 min), the reaction mixture was
quenched with a saturated sodium bicarbonate/10 M NaOH solution and
extracted in a DCM solvent (1 × 3). The combined organic layers
were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent
was evaporated in vacuum. The crude mixture was purified by flash
column chromatography using EtOAc/hexane (1:4) or DCM/hexane (1:1
to 1:0) solvent system to afford the desired products.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of 3-Alkenyl-oxindoles 4
DIPM 1C was treated with DDQ according
to the above-mentioned DDQ-mediated oxidation procedure, and the resulting
crude mixture was treated with imidazole (5 equiv) and TBDMSCl (5
equiv) in DCM solvent. After the completion of the reaction, as indicated
by TLC, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 and extracted in DCM (1 × 3). The combined DCM layers
were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent
was evaporated on a rotavap. The crude mixture was purified by flash
column chromatography using EtOAc/hexane (1:4) solvent to afford the
TBS-protected 3-alkenyl-oxindole products.

Test Bacterial Pathogens
Compounds 2a–p, 3a–h, and 4a–e, 4a′–e′, and 4f were screened for their antibacterial activity
against four Gram-positive bacteria, namely, B. cereus MTCC 1305, S. aureus MTCC 902, S. epidermidis MTCC 435, and S. simulans MTCC 3610, and five Gram-negative bacteria, namely, E. coli MTCC 2622, K. pneumoniae MTCC 109, P. mirabilis MTCC 425, P. aeruginosa MTCC 2642, and S. typhi MTCC 3216. All of the bacterial pathogens were procured from Microbial
Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank, CSIR-IMTECH, Chandigarh, India,
and maintained on nutrient agar slants. The MIC and MBC experiments
of the optimized compounds 2a and 2n were
performed against one methicillin-susceptible S. aureus MTCC737, four MRSA strains, E. coli MTCC443, A. baumannii MTCC1425, and K. pneumniae ATCC700603.
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
ATCC33591 and K. pneumniae ATCC700603
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Clinically
isolated MRSA strains, MRSA-R3545, MRSA-R3889, and MRSA-R3990, were
obtained from the Department of Neuromicrobiology, National Institute
of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Hosur Road, Bangalore 560029,
India. All of the MTCC bacterial strains were purchased from MTCC
(Chandigarh, India).

Antibacterial Activity
Zone of Inhibition Assay
The preliminary antibacterial
screening was performed by the disk diffusion method against the test
bacteria (CLSI, 2012). The test cultures maintained in the nutrient
agar slants at 4 °C were subcultured in a nutrient broth to obtain
the working cultures approximately containing 1 × 106 cfu/mL. Mueller–Hinton (MH) agar plates were swabbed with
each bacterial strain. Each compound (30 μg) in 30 μL
of DMSO was incorporated in a sterile disk of 6 mm diameter and DMSO
served as the control. Zone of inhibition was measured after 24 h
of incubation at 37 °C.

MIC Assay
The
experiment was performed by following
the reported protocol.29 The required working
concentrations of the compounds were prepared in Millipore water from
10 mg/mL stock solution in DMSO; 100 μL of the compounds was
then serially diluted by twofold in a 96-well plate in an autoclaved
Millipore water. After that, the mid-log phase (6 h grown) bacterial
culture (∼108 cfu/mL) was diluted to ∼105 cfu/mL in the nutrient broth. These bacterial suspensions
(150 μL) were then added to the wells containing 50 μL
of the compound solution. After that, the plate was incubated with
shaking for 24 h at 37 °C. At the end, the optical density (OD)
of the plates was measured at 600 nm using TECAN Plate Reader (Infinite
series, M200 pro). The MIC value was considered as the lowest concentration
of
the compound at which the OD was similar to that of the media control.
The experiment was performed in triplicate.

MBC Assay
The
same experimental protocol was followed
as outlined for the MIC assay. Here, instead of the OD measurement,
the solution from the experimental wells was directly drop plated
(3 μL) on the agar plate and again incubated for 24 h. Finally,
the MBC values were determined as the minimum concentration of the
compounds at which no bacterial colony was observed.

Time-Kill
Kinetics
The time-kill kinetics of compounds 2a and 2n were performed against MRSA-ATCC33591.
The experiment was performed at three different concentrations (4,
8, and 16 μg/mL) of both the compounds by following the reported
protocol.29c The required concentration
of the compounds was prepared in Millipore water from 10 mg/mL stock
solution in DMSO and 50 μL was added to the wells of the 96-well
plate. After that, the mid-log phase (6 h grown) MRSA culture was
diluted
to ∼106 cfu/mL in the nutrient broth and 150 μL
was added to the wells containing the compound and allowed to incubate
under shaking at 37 °C. A control experiment was performed in
which the same volume of the autoclaved Millipore water was added
instead of the compound. However, at different time intervals, 20
μL of aliquots was serially diluted by 10-fold in 0.9% saline,
and 20 μL of these serially diluted solutions were spot plated
on the agar plates. The plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37
°C and viable bacterial colonies counted. The bacterial cell
viability was determined and the results were presented in the logarithmic
scale.
