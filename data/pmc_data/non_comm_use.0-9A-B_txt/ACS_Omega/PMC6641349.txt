The norbornenyl gluconamide (NBGA)
monomer can be polymerized by
a number of palladium catalysts to give water-soluble, vinyl addition
poly(NBGA). Depending on the catalyst used, the reaction conditions,
and the chain-transfer additives employed, high-molecular-weight polymers
can be obtained. These polymers can be thermally cross-linked at ca.
190 °C or at ca. 150 °C when the difunctional glutaraldehyde
is added. A photopatternable composition is formed by the addition
of a water-soluble diazide when the poly(NBGA) molecular weight is
sufficiently high. After image-wise exposure, negative-tone patterns
are revealed by water development. A detailed analysis of NBGA monomer
structures by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance techniques
including pure shift is reported showing that two diastereomers of
each endo- and exo-isomer are formed from the reaction of norbornene
methylamine and δ-gluconolactone.

Introduction
Solubility of macromolecules
can be tailored by a judicious choice
of the monomeric repeat units. For example, by incorporating heteroatoms
in the repeat units, solubility of polymers generally increases in
more polar solvents. The solubility is usually enhanced for lower-molecular-weight
polymers; thus, molecular weight control is typically desired. Manipulation
of the polymer microstructure of the backbone of the polymer can affect
the solubility; more tactic polymers are usually less soluble than
less tactic polymers.

In the case of ring-opening metathesis
polymerization poly(norbornene),
researchers have been successful in creating water-soluble polymers
by incorporating cationic salts of norbornene monomers,1 ethylene oxide pendent groups,2−6 and saccharide-functional norbornene derivatives.7,8 Vinyl addition norbornene polymers are rendered water-soluble by
the incorporation of pendent ammonium cations,9 derivatives of gluconolactone or lactobionic acid,10,11 or derivatives of galactopyranose,12 among
others.13

Photoresists typically
comprise a polymeric binder resin in an
organic solvent along with other photosensitive additives.14 After coating a substrate, the organic solvent
is removed in a post apply bake step forming a film. After image-wise
exposure of the remaining film, a chemical reaction occurs that renders
the exposed region soluble in a developer (positive tone) or insoluble
in a developer (negative tone). The resulting three-dimensional relief
image is then typically subjected to an etch step (either wet or dry),
after which the relief pattern is transferred into the substrate.
Because the majority portion of a photoresist consists of solvents,
it would be prudent to use a solvent that is benign from a health
and safety perspective.

In the late 1990s, two publications
reported routes to both positive-
and negative-tone chemically amplified photopolymer compositions that
used water as a solvent and as a developer after imagewise exposure.
Fréchet, Willson, and co-workers described a positive-tone
system based on a pre-cross-linked poly(acrylic acid)/divinyl ether
composition.15 Later, a negative-tone system
based on a sugar-modified poly(acrylate) appeared.16

We aimed to develop water-soluble vinyl addition
norbornene photopolymer
compositions to take advantage of this benign solvent as well as the
expected higher etch resistance that norbornene vinyl addition polymers
provide.17 Although Puech, et al.10,11 and Hu, et al.12 had some success at
forming norbornene-type vinyl addition polymers with saccharide pendent
groups, such methods appear limited in that the polymers obtained
had low-weight-average molecular weights (18 000 Da or less)
or limited to a process having very high palladium catalyst loading
(e.g., from 10:1 to 100:1 monomer to catalyst molar ratio). In this
article, a method is developed for polymerization of norbornenyl gluconamide
(NBGA) at low palladium catalyst concentration with molecular weight
control in water as well as formulations which allow photopatterning
with water development.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of NBGA
The NBGA monomer
was synthesized by the reaction of δ-gluconolactone with norbornenyl
methylamine (Scheme 1) using a procedure much similar to what has been published by Puech,
et al.10,11 In this reaction, the nucleophilic amine
ring opens the lactone to form the amide linkage in NBGA. The monomer
was obtained in moderate yield as a white solid.

Scheme 1 Reaction of Norbornenyl
Methylamine with δ-Gluconolactone to
Form NBGA
The synthesis of NBGA
should produce both endo- and exo-products
because the norbornenyl methylamine starting material is a mixture
of both isomers (endo-/exo- mol ratio, ca. 80/20). However, the potential
product stereochemistry is not limited to just endo- and exo-isomers;
each endo- and exo-isomers exist as pairs of enantiomers and should
produce diastereomers of both endo- and exo-isomers because the starting
δ-gluoconolactone is isomerically pure. Thus in principle, the
NBGA product should exist as four different isomers, a diastereomeric
pair of endo-isomers (Scheme 1, structures 1A, 1B), and a diastereomeric
pair of exo-isomers (Scheme 1, structures 2A, 2B). The coexistence
of these structures and their complex multiplet patterns in the proton
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum impeded plausible
assignment of chemical sites; even with the aid of conventional two-dimensional
(2D)-NMR methods, a significant problem in the characterization was
experienced. Such a complexity rendered misassignment and/or incomplete
analysis in the past.10 Herein, we tackled
the assignment problem by taking advantage of the improvement in spectral
resolution offered by pure shift nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
techniques.18−21 The Supporting Information Tables S1
and S2 show 1H (reported from the 1D-1H pure
shift spectrum) and 13C (reported from 1D-13C spectrum) NMR chemical shifts of these structures, respectively.

Endo- and exo-isomers (endo-/exo- mol ratio, 80/20) of NBGA were
evident from 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1), in particular, from the amide proton (H-9) and olefinic
proton (H-5 and H-6) resonances. They can be further distinguished
from one another by comparing relative strengths of couplings between
H-1 and H-2. The distinction is based on a very different H–C-1–C-2–H
dihedral angle between the endo- and exo-isomers. In endo-isomers,
the coupling constant JH-1H-2 is ca. 3.66 Hz, large enough to be observed as H-1/H-2 correlation
spectroscopy (COSY) correlations (the dihedral angle is ca. 47°).
However in exo-isomers, the coupling constant JH-1H-2 is ca. 0.55 Hz, causing a very weak or
a complete disappearance of H-1/H-2 COSY correlations (the dihedral
angle is ca. 72°).22 (In complete
agreement with the result of double quantum filter (DQF)-COSY NMR
(Figure S13) showing correlations between
H-1 (2.77 ppm) and H-2 (ca. 2.21 ppm) for endo-isomers, but no such
correlations between H-1 (ca. 2.75 ppm) and H-2 (ca. 1.51 ppm) for
exo-isomers) (Karplus equation used to compute dihedral angle is J = 8.5 cos2 φ – 0.28 (0° <
φ < 90°) where φ = dihedral angle).23 However, this analysis does not indicate the
formation of diastereomeric pairs of endo-(1A and 1B) and exo-(2A and 2B) isomers.

Figure 1 shows the
olefinic section of the pure shift heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC)19 spectrum of the NBGA monomer in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. Spectral
resolution was improved by the combination of pure shifting (homo-decoupling)
in the 1H dimension and spectral aliasing in the 13C dimension. Projected onto the 1H (F2) axis is the corresponding region from a conventional 1H NMR spectrum, where overlapping multiplets (giving the appearance
of unoverlapped multiplets) are clearly seen. However, in pure shift,
the proton multiplets collapsed to singlets, thereby improving the
resolution and component-signal discernment (as shown in Figure 1, the CH chemical
sites (5 and 6) of four NBGA isomers are resolved in both the 1H and 13C dimensions, the lone exception being
CH site 6 of the exo-isomers where 1H chemical shifts occurred
at a single spot as well as the 13C chemical shifts).

Figure 1 Olefinic
regions of the pure shift HSQC spectrum of a sample of
NBGA monomers showing the assignments of four isomers, two each for
endo-(1A/1B) and exo-(2A/2B) isomers.

After each chemical site was discerned (Tables S1 and S2), the atomic connectivity
was confirmed by HMBC. Figure 2 shows various sections of a band-selective HMBC spectrum
at the amide carbonyl carbon (C-10). The correlations observed in
the spectrum are multiple bond (usually between those separated by
2- and 3-bonds) correlations between 1H and 13C (in this spectrum, 1Hs are from H-8, H-9, H-11, OH-11,
and OH-12, and 13Cs are from C-10 sites). Correlations
to four distinct C-10 sites, one from each of the four isomers (two
endo- and two exo-) of NBGA, are observed. As for example, all of
these four C-10s show correlations to their respective H-8s (protons
from the norbornene side of the amide bond) and H-11s (protons from
the saccharide side of the amide bond), and thereby confirm that the
saccharide and methylnorbornenyl groups of these four isomers are
connected to each other via the amide bond. The results from pure
shift total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and 1H selective
TOCSY (full details of the analysis are given in the Supporting Information) reveal correlations between all protons
in a chain with unbroken proton–proton couplings confirming
atomic connectivity within each of the saccharide and methylnorbornenyl
groups.

of NBGA monomers showing 1H–13C multiple-bond
correlations to amide carbonyl carbons (C-10).

Using the resolving power of the pure shift NMR technique,
we have
been able to show that the product from the reaction of norbornenyl
methylamine and δ-gluconolactone yields a pair of diastereomers
of both the endo- and exo-isomers. While four sets of chemical shifts
due to these four isomers have been identified, the assignment of
these sets of chemical shifts to the individual structures is not
possible. Nevertheless, δ-gluconolactone is essentially acting
as a chiral derivatization reagent, much similar to Mosher’s
ester, rendering the enantiomeric norbornenyl methylamine discernible
by NMR techniques as diastereomers.24

Polymerization of NBGA Using [(Allyl)PdCl]2 and TPPTS
Puech and co-workers10,11 initially reported
the polymerization of NBGA using PdCl2 modified by the
water-soluble phosphine [triphenylphosphine-m-trisulfonic
acid trisodium salt (TPPTS)]. We have shown that polymerization of
norbornene monomers could be obtained at high yield with low catalyst
loading using phosphine derivatives of allyl palladium compounds.25 The high activity also translated to suspension
and emulsion polymerization in water with added TPPTS and surfactant.
The particle size of the 5-butyl-2-norbornene homopolymer made in
emulsion was determined to be about 181 nm with a polydispersity of
2.6.26 Later, similar behavior was reported
by Chemtob and Gilbert.27 Because of the
high activity of the allyl palladium compounds, we initially tried
polymerization of NBGA with the TPPTS derivative in water in an attempt
to obtain the polymer at a lower catalyst loading.

The results
of the first polymerization (Table 1, experiment 1), gave reasonable conversion and molecular
weight (58% and 14 100 Mw). The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S62) shows
no olefinic resonances consistent with the presence of a vinyl addition
poly(norbornene).

the Presence of Formic Acid Using [(Allyl)PdCl]2, TPPTS,
and LiFABA

About 10 years ago, we discovered that formic acid could be used
to enhance the conversion of norbornene polymerizations and can act
as a chain-transfer agent.28,29 Given the solubility
of formic acid in water, we investigated the performance of this additive
in the polymerization of NBGA. The conversion increased as the concentration
of formic acid increased (Table 1). As expected, the molecular weight decreases. In
each case, the polymerization is carried out in the presence of LiFABA
which forms the active, cationic catalyst in situ.25

Polymerization of NBGA Using [(PiPr3)2Pd(O2CMe)(MeCN)][B(C6F5)4]
Bell, Protasiewicz, and co-workers reported the synthesis
of a family
of cationic palladium compounds from their neutral precursors by reaction
with salts of weakly coordinating anions.30 These cationic compounds have found utility in the polymerization
of norbornene monomers.31 In general, these
compounds generated high conversions of polymer with very high molecular
weight. Because the molecular weights of poly(NBGA) reported by Puech
using the TPPTS derivative of palladium dichloride and [(allyl)PdCl]2 shown above were low, we investigated the ability of one
member of this cationic catalyst family to generate poly(NBGA) with
higher molecular weight.

In Table 2, experiment 1 shows that, as expected, the
polymerization of NBGA using [(PiPr3)2Pd(O2CMe)(MeCN)][B(C6F5)4] gave
a modest conversion in the absence of formic acid. However, the molecular
weight of the polymer was approximately 10-fold higher than when [(allyl)PdCl]2 was employed. As shown in experiments 2–5, when the
formic acid concentration increased, the conversion increased initially
and leveled-off, and the molecular weight decreased; the effect of
formic acid on NBGA polymer weight-average molecular weight is presented
graphically in Figure 3.

A detailed investigation of mechanism of norbornene polymerization
initiated by [(PiPr3)2Pd(O2CMe)(MeCN)][B(C6F5)4] in the presence of formic acid
indicated that the reason for the increased polymer conversion was
due to the formation of a palladium hydride complex which initiates
polymerization.29 Results of a deuterium-labeling
study supported the supposition that chain-transfer occurs after the
β-hydride elimination from a palladium formyl intermediate.
It is likely that a similar mechanism is operative for the polymerization
of NBGA.

Thermal Reaction of Poly(NBGA)
The thermal stability
of poly(NBGA) was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
In the TGA trace (Figure S63), the polymer
experiences a gradual weight loss from room temperature to about 175
°C. This is likely because of the loss of absorbed and adsorbed
water in this very hydrophilic polymer. A similar behavior has been
observed for gluconamide functional poly(acrylates).32 Above about 175 °C, a substantial weight loss occurs.
This is likely because of dehydration and condensation reactions of
the gluconamide pendent functionality in the polymer which typically
occurs for sugars.

Guided by the TGA results, the thermal cross-linking
of a film of poly(NBGA) was tested. In this series of experiments,
a film of poly(NBGA) was spun onto a silicon wafer. The wafer was
baked for 5 min at 130 °C to remove the water. The film thickness
was determined. Then, the film was exposed to water for 5 min. In
this case, the film was dissolved off the wafer (experiment 1, Table 3). Another wafer was
prepared in the same fashion except that the film was heated to 130
°C for 5 min twice. Again, water exposure dissolved the poly(NBGA)
film (experiment 2 in Table 3). Identical results were obtained for experiment 3 in which
the wafer was baked at 130 °C for 5 min and then at 150 °C
for 5 min. Not until the wafer was heated at 190 °C for 5 min
did the poly(NBGA) film remain, after exposure to water (experiment
4). The film thickness remained essentially unchanged after a third
bake (1.28 μm), indicating that there was no significant swelling
during the water-exposure step. These results are consistent with
cross-linking occurring for poly(NBGA) near or at 190 °C as a
consequence of dehydration and condensation, as reflected in the weight
loss occurring above about 175 °C in the TGA trace.

Reaction of Poly(NBGA) with Glutaraldehyde
The reaction
of poly(vinyl alcohol) with butyraldehyde forms poly(vinyl butyral)
which is used in safety glass applications, among others.33 Hydrogels of poly(vinyl alcohol) can be prepared
by cross-linking with difunctional aldehydes such as gluraldehyde.34 The plethora of alcohol groups in poly(NBGA)
suggested that cross-linking of this polymer with a difunctional aldehyde
such as glutaraldehyde to form acetal linkages would be favorable
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Representation
of Cross-linked Poly(NBGA) by Reaction with Glutaraldehyde
and Formation of Acetal Linkages
To test this concept, mixtures of poly(NBGA) with increasing
concentration
of glutaraldehyde ranging from 0 to 20 gphr (grams of additive per
hundred grams of poly(NBGA)) were made. Films of these mixtures were
prepared on silicon wafers by spin-coating. After baking at 150 °C
for 5 min, the film thickness was determined by profilometry at 22
°C and 50% relative humidity. The films were then immersed in
water. In the case of 0 gphr glutaraldehyde, the film was completely
washed away with water (experiment 1, Table 4). However, for 10 and 20 gphr glutaraldehyde,
the majority of the film was retained after water immersion. The determination
of film thickness after water immersion and a second bake (190 °C
for 3 min) to remove residual water show that little swelling of the
films occurred during water immersion (experiments 2 and 3, Table 4). In contrast to
these results in which cross-linking occurred at 150 °C with
glutaraldehyde, the thermal reaction presented above without glutaraldehyde
at 150 °C was insufficient to produce cross-linked films. The
addition of glutaraldehyde effectively cross-links poly(NBGA) at a
lower temperature.

Photopatterning of Poly(NBGA)
To create a photopatternable
composition from poly(NBGA), a photoactive compound was needed that
was soluble in water. Disodium 4,4′-diazidostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate
(DAZST-Na) has been shown to be a suitable photoactive cross-linker
for poly(vinylpyrrolidone), a water-soluble polymer.35 An added bonus is the maximum absorption of DAZST-Na, which
is near the maximum output of an i-line exposure unit: 365 nm.36 Diazide extrudes dinitrogen upon exposure to
create chemically reactive nitrenes that can insert into C–H/O–H
bonds of the polymer, thereby cross-linking the film.

Poly(NBGA)
(Mw = 60 000) gave good-quality
films as thick as 5 μm on silicon. The polymer was formulated
with DAZST-Na in water. Films of this formulation were exposed with
increasing dose at 365 nm and developed with water. The remaining
film thickness after development was determined. From this data, a
contrast curve (film thickness remaining after development vs dose)
was constructed (Figure 4). At a relatively low exposure dose (ca. 10 mJ/cm2),
the film thickness retention begins to climb until ca. 100% is retained
at ca. 30 mJ/cm2. From this curve, the contrast γ
was determined to be 3.35 using eq 1 (Experimental Section).

Figure 4 Effect of dose
on normalized film thickness after development with
water.

Next films of the poly(NBGA) formulation
with DAZST-Na were imagewise
exposed at 365 nm and developed with water. The resulting negative-tone
3D patterns were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the
results of which are presented in Figure 5. At a dose of 46 mJ/cm2, 50 μm
trenches were produced after water development. A cross-sectional
SEM photomicrograph showed that the side walls of the patterns were
sloped.

Figure 5 SEM micrograph of negative-tone patterns obtained from poly(NBGA)
and DAZST-Na at a dose of 46 mJ/cm2: top-down view (top)
and side view (bottom).

When the experiment was repeated with a lower-molecular-weight
poly(NBGA) (Mw = 18 000), the exposed
film washed off the wafer during water development. This indicates
that such a lower-molecular-weight polymer was insufficiently cross-linked
and exhibited a fast dissolution rate in water, thereby failing to
form negative-tone features. Without the development of methods for
making high-molecular-weight poly(NBGA) presented herein, the formation
of negative-tone features under the conditions described would have
been unsuccessful.

Conclusions
Using the pure shift
NMR technique, two diastereomers of both endo-
and exo-isomers of NBGA have been identified. Methods for making higher-molecular-weight
poly(NBGA) are developed by using alternative catalysts than those
disclosed earlier along with methods for controlling molecular weight
by the addition of formic acid. Poly(NBGA) films are cross-linked
at 190 °C. Cross-linking occurs at lower temperatures if glutaraldehyde
is present. Photoactive compounds similar to DAZST-Na can cross-link
poly(NBGA) upon exposure and form negative-tone features if the molecular
weight is sufficiently high.

Used for Photopatterning of Poly(NBGA)
All NMR measurements were performed at 298 K in DMSO-d6 ((CD3)2SO) or pyridine-d5 (C5D5N) using a Bruker
AVANCE IIIHD 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a double-resonance
pulse-field-gradient BBFO probe (5 mm). For the analysis of monomers,
both 1D- (1H, 1H Sel-TOCSY, 13C)
and 2D- (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC, and HSQC-TOCSY) NMR measurements
were conducted; pure shift18−21 NMR (both 1D- and 2D-) measurements were also carried
out. For samples dissolved in (CD3)2SO, the 1H NMR spectral window (centered at 3.961 ppm) was ca. 6250
Hz. For samples dissolved in C5D5N, the 1H NMR spectral window (centered at 4.596 ppm) was ca. 7002.801
Hz. The 13C NMR spectral window (centered at 102.000 ppm)
was ca. 20 000.00 Hz (however, for high-resolution band-selective
HMBC and aliased HSQC, narrow band 13C NMR spectral window
was used). In general, the relaxation delay was 1–2 s, and
32k–64k data points (2k–4k data points in 2D experiments)
per scan were averaged over 4–16 scans (256–4k t1 data points were acquired in the indirect
dimension of 2D experiments). Relevant parameters used in the quantitative
NMR are 13C: 30° flip angle (90° pulse duration
was 10 us), 64k data points, 1.05 s acquisition time, 840 scans, 16
s relaxation delay (with gated 1H decoupling), and experiment
time of ca. 4 h, 1H: 30° flip angle (90° pulse
duration was 12 μs), 64k data points, 5.24 s acquisition time,
16 scans, 20 s relaxation delay, and experiment time of ca. 7.5 min. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts data were recorded
relative to ((CD3)2SO) (residual internal CD3CD2HSO (δ1H = 2.5000 ppm) and
δ13C = 39.93 ppm).

Polymer molecular weights
were determined by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) according to the following procedure. Approximately 50 mg of
polymer was dissolved in 20 mL of N,N-dimethylacetamide (0.05 M NaNO3). The samples were gently
shaken to dissolve. The solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm
PTFE disposable syringe filter prior to addition to the autosampler.
The GPC system (Waters 2695 Separations Module) was equipped with
a PL 10 μm Guard + PLgel 10 μm Mixed B × 2 column
set. Eluant was N,N-dimethylacetamide
(0.05 M NaNO3) at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min. The temperature
of the column was 60 °C. Measurements were made using a Waters
2414 refractive index detector and were reported relative to narrow
molecular weight polystyrene standards. In some experiments, conversion
of polymerizations was reported as a ratio of the area percent of
the polymer peak relative to the area percent of the monomer peak
from the GPC measurements. TGA measurements were made using a TA Q500
instrument. Samples were heated at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under
nitrogen from 30 to 500 °C.

Synthesis of NBGA
NBGA was prepared largely according
to a procedure (Scheme 1), published by Puech, et al.10,11 Norbornenyl methylamine
(69.2 g, 0.562 mol) was added to a methanol solution (approximately
1L) of δ-gluconolactone (100 g, 0.562 mol). The solution was
stirred at room temperature for 23 h, resulting in a clear, pale-yellow
solution. The solution was added to ether (approximately 3.0 L) to
yield a precipitate which was filtered, rinsed with ether (approximately
1.0 L), and dried under vacuum at 70 °C overnight, giving 107
g (63%). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) (diamond cell): ν(amide
NH and sugar OH, H-bond, s br) at 3327 cm–1; ν(=CH,

of NBGA monomer is described in the Results and Discussion section.

Representative Polymerization of NBGA Using
[(Allyl)PdCl]2 and (TPPTS)
NBGA (45 g, 0.15 mol),
[(allyl)PdCl]2 (0.030 mg, 0.082 mmol), LiFABA (0.40 mg,
0.46 mmol), and
TPPTS (0.20 mg, 0.35 mmol) were added to a glass vial equipped with
a magnetic stir bar in a glovebox. The vial was sealed with a septum,
and sufficient water (sparged with nitrogen) was added to the vial
outside of the glovebox using a syringe to form ca. 30% by weight
solution of NBGA. After the components dissolved in water, the solution
was sparged with nitrogen for 25 min. Then, formic acid (0.687 g)
was added to the vial and the mixture was heated to 60 °C for
18 h. The reaction mixture was cooled and the polymer was precipitated
from 3 L of acetone. The solid was filtered, and the filter cake was
rinsed with methanol (1 L). The polymer was then dried in a vacuum
oven at 70 °C for 16 h. Yield 21.5 g (48%). GPC: Mw = 12 300; Mn = 9180.
For a representative sample of the polymer, 1H NMR data
were obtained in the same manner as that of the NBGA monomer. 1H NMR ((CD3)2SO) δ (ppm): 7.51
(br s, NH), 5.35 (br s, OH-11/–C(O)–CH(OH)−), 4.50 (br m, OH-12, 13, 14, 15/>CHOH), 4.00 (br m, H-11,12/>CHOH), 3.50 (m,
H-13,14/>CHOH), 3.30 (m, H-15/–CH2OH), 3.1 (br s, aliphatic H including H-8/–CH2–NHCO−), 2.5–0.5 (br
m, aliphatic H).

Representative Polymerization of NBGA Using trans-[(PiPr3)2Pd(O2CMe)(MeCN)][B(C6F5)4]
The
palladium complex trans-[(PiPr3)2Pd(O2CMe)(MeCN)][B(C6F5)4] (0.012 g, 0.010 mmol) and solid NBGA monomer (3.01 g, 10.0 mmol)
were added to a vial equipped with a magnetic stir bar. In the glovebox,
lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate etherate (0.026 g, 0.030
mmol) was added. On the bench, a water (6.95 g) and formic acid (0.37
g, 0.8 mmol) solution was sparged with nitrogen and then added to
the monomer and catalyst mixture. The solution was heated to 80 °C
for 18 h. Conversion: 78% (by GPC). GPC: Mw = 76 200; Mn = 45 920.

Thermal Cross-linking Experiments
Poly(NBGA) (Mw = 9800) was dissolved in water (20 weight
percent solution). The solution was spin-coated onto four quartz wafers
(500 rpm for 5 s followed by 1500 rpm for 40 s). The wafers were then
baked for 5 min at 130 °C. The thickness of the film was determined
by profilometry. One wafer was not baked; the remaining three wafers
were baked at 130, 150, or 190 °C for 5 min. The wafers were
immersed in water for 5 min. The film thickness was then again determined
by profilometry. The wafers were baked a third time at 190 °C
for 3 min, and the film thickness was measured again by profilometry.

Cross-linking of Poly(NBGA) with Glutaraldehyde
Poly(NBGA)
(Mw = 12 300) was dissolved in
a water/propylene glycol methyl ether (50/50) solution (20 wt % percent
polymer). A second and third solution was made, but with 10 phr (part
per hundred) and 20 phr glutaraldehyde, respectively. Three quartz
wafers were spin-coated separately with each solution (500 rpm for
5 s followed by 1500 rpm for 40 s). The three wafers were then baked
for 5 min at 150 °C. The thickness of the resulting film on each
wafer was determined by profilometry. The wafers were immersed in
water for 5 min. The film thickness was then determined again by profilometry.
If the film remained on the wafer, the wafer was baked a second time
at 190 °C for 3 min, and the film thickness was measured again.

Photopatterning
Poly(NBGA) (Mw = 60 000) was dissolved in deionized water (10 wt
%) along with DAZST-Na (3 wt % on the polymer). The solution, after
filtration, was spin-coated onto a thermal oxide silicon wafer (500
rpm for 10 s followed by 1000 rpm for 60 s). The wafer was then baked
at 130 °C for 2 min. The film thickness was determined to be
1.3 μm by profilometry. Using a variable density mask and an
i-line band-pass filter, the polymer film was exposed using an AB-M
mask aligner (medium-pressure Hg lamp) and developed using water (60
s puddle development). The thickness was then determined as a function
of dose, determined at 365 nm. From these data, the contrast (γ)
of the formulation was determined using the following formula: 1  where Df is the
minimum dose at which the film thickness is retained and Do is the maximum dose at which the film thickness is removed
by the developer.38

The experiment
was repeated but the film was imagewise exposed through a chrome on
glass mask using an AB-M mask aligner using an i-line band-pass filter.
After water development, patterns on the wafer were examined using
SEM.
