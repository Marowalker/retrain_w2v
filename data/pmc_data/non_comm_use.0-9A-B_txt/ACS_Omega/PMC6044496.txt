Agricultural
wastes such as the peels of onion and garlic were
used as a supplement along with l-asparagine for the very
first time to produce increased yield of l-asparaginase by Pseudomonas plecoglossicida RS1. Statistical optimization
strategies such as response surface methodology were used to generate
a medium composition containing extracts of 0.9 (v/v) of garlic peel
waste and 0.5% (v/v) onion peel waste along with 0.2% (w/w) l-asparagine, which yielded a twofold increase in the enzyme activity
compared to the unsupplemented minimal (M-9) medium. The presence
of l-asparagine content in the peel extract was confirmed
by high-performance liquid chromatography. Further, l-asparaginase
was purified to homogeneity, and identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis. The application
of the purified l-asparaginase as a therapeutic was studied
in HeLa cells which showed a p53-mediated G2 cell cycle
arrest. Moreover, the purified l-asparaginase showed effective
acrylamide mitigation in vitro, at 6 IU, and its effective degradation
was also demonstrated by the effect on chemotactic index of Caenorhabditis elegans and the restoration of the
cognitive abilities of C. elegans which
was coexposed to acrylamide and l-asparaginase compared to
that exposed to acrylamide alone. Thus, l-asparaginase, with
multipotent applications, was produced by effective waste utilization
for economical commercial production.

Introduction
India being an agricultural
nation, it is a resource hub for generating
agro wastes, and till the year 2015, reports observe that 1500 lakh
ton agro waste was produced in India every year. Hence, if such wastes
could be deployed as a useful media component for the development
of a commercially valuable product, it would further boost economical
production and facilitate waste remediation. In some cases, preconsumer
organic wastes have been used for the production of garbage enzyme,
which finds an application in antimicrobial agents and treatment of
domestic, municipal, and industrial wastes.1 To enhance the production of many such important enzymes, various
wastes have been used as an alternative substrate, such as municipal
solid wastes, sugar industry wastes, and even agro wastes such as
corncob.2−4

One such important enzyme, l-asparaginase,
has been used
commercially in therapeutics and in the food industry for its ability
to catalyze the conversion of l-asparagine to l-aspartic
acid and ammonia. Various bacterial and fungal sources have been known
to produce l-asparaginase; however, the commercial production
of this enzyme by these organisms using cheaper substrates is of considerable
interest to researchers.

l-Asparaginase finds applications
in therapeutics as a
cytotoxic agent where it catalyzes the breakdown of l-asparagine
to aspartic acid and ammonia in physiological conditions in human
blood, thus selectively depriving the auxotrophic malignant cells
of the vital nutrient l-asparagine.5,6 This
has been well-documented in the cases of many cancers such as acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin disease, lymphosarcoma, and pancreatic
carcinoma.7,8

Further, the biocatalyst also finds
an application in the food
industry for its ability to prevent the formation of acrylamide in
oven-heated and fried foods where the reaction of free asparagine
and reducing sugars gives rise to acrylamide which is a carcinogen.9,10 The toxicity of acrylamide in environment has been previously studied
in Arabidopsis.11

This study highlights the process optimization for
the production
of l-asparaginase using cheap agro wastes, namely, onion
peels and garlic peels, by applying statistical modeling tools such
as response surface methodology (RSM) by central composite design
(CCD), thus establishing the optimal conditions of a multivariable
system of production media. Further, the purified enzyme l-asparaginase was prospected for its multipotent applications as
an anticancer agent on human cervical cancer cells, and its acrylamide
mitigation ability was studied using live animal model Caenorhabditis elegans.

Results and Discussion
Production
of l-Asparaginase by Pseudomonas
plecoglossicida RS1 Using M-9 Medium Supplemented
with Onion and Garlic Peels
The production of l-asparaginase
on a commercial scale is a matter of interest because of its therapeutic
applications as an anticancer agent. Hence, various alternative cheaper
substrates have been prospected for the commercial production of l-asparaginase, including industrial effluent,2 corncob,3 coconut oil cake,
and leguminous crops.12

Onion and
garlic peels have hitherto been used as an alternative source of inulin
for the increased production of inulinase by solid-state cultivation.13 Other than inulin, onion peels are rich in phenolic
compounds and flavonoids such as quercetin,14 and its wastes (onion skin) are frequently utilized as a cheap adsorbent
for decontamination purposes and an alternative for the treatment
of wastewaters.15 Furthermore, phenolic
compounds such as quercetin and vanillic acids have been reported
to influence the enzyme activity of arginine deiminase to increase
about 37–40% higher, and thus the effect of phenolic compounds
in enzyme metabolism cannot be understated.16 Moreover, onion peel and garlic peel contain many such polyphenolic
compounds and sulfur-containing compounds including S-allylcysteine sulfoxide (alliin; characteristic of garlic), ajoene,
and S-allylcysteine. Such compounds may facilitate
the induction of certain specific enzymes, alliinase (EC 4.4.1.4),
which cleaves the above precursors to give pyruvate, ammonia, and
thiosulfinate.17 Substances in purified
alliin and those related to alliin were determined by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) mass spectrometry(MS)/MS by Liakopoulou-Kyriakides
et al. in (1985)18 and Yuan et al. (2007),19 and they were identified as proline, asparagine,
glutamine, methionine, arginine, isoalliin, and cycloalliin. Because
of the presence of such components, it may be proposed that allium
may induce the production of l-asparaginase, which breaks
down l-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia similar to
alliinase. In this study, onion and garlic peels were subjected to
bacterial degradation by P. plecoglossicida RS1 in M-9 medium (Supporting Information, Table S1) and the peels from the culture media (M-9 OG medium)
were subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis.

SEM of
the Fragments of Peels in M-9 OG Medium
The
M-9 medium was cultivated with P. plecoglossicida RS1 for 48 h at 37 °C, and the peel fragments were sputter-coated
with gold particles and observed with the help of a scanning electron
microscope (Supporting Information, Figure
S1). Uninoculated OG medium was used as a control. The adherence of
the bacteria onto the peels and the corresponding degradation of the
peels were visually evidenced. Thus, the utilization of the wastes
for their effective remediation was also proved using the dried peel
powder.

Hence, these peels were used in this study to increase
the production of l-asparaginase. It was observed by previous
experiments performed that garlic peels alone or onion peels alone,
for l-asparaginase production, did not show any significant
increase in neither enzyme activity nor specific activity (data not
shown). Further, when the peels were used as a supplement along with
0.3 w/v % of l-asparagine (Supporting Information, Table S1), maximum enzyme activity was observed.

HPLC Analysis of OG Peel Extracts
HPLC analysis of
the peel extracts revealed the presence of l-asparagine in
garlic peels, showing peaks [retention time (RT)—5.047 and
5.382] at the same RT as standard l-asparagine (RT—5.024
and 5.360). Earlier
reports of HPLC of l-asparagine similarly showed a RT at
5.8 min.13 Onion peels also showed the
retention peaks at a nearly similar time (RT—5.172 and 5.442),
however, in lesser quantity (14%) than that in garlic peels (20%)
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). Therefore,
the peels extracted in potassium phosphate buffer were used as a supplement
along with l-asparagine to enhance l-asparaginase
production by P. plecoglossicida RS1.

In the analysis for enzyme production, both higher enzyme yields
along with higher protein content were obtained when 1% (v/v) of peel
extract was used along with 0.3% l-asparagine (Table 1). Hence, CCD was made, and
RSM was undertaken to study the interaction between the onion peel
(0.5 v/v %) and garlic peel extract (0.5 v/v %) and l-asparagine
(0.2 w/v %).

RSM-Based Study
of Parameters Critical to the Production of l-Asparaginase
by P. plecoglossicida RS1 in a Medium
Supplemented with Onion Peel and Garlic Peel Extracts
CCD
with the three factors viz., concentrations of the extract
of onion peel, garlic peel extract, and l-asparagine, with
the central values as 0.5 v/v %, 0.5 v/v %, and 0.2 w/v %, respectively,
was made, and its results are given in Table 2. It is evident from Table 2 that the observed values of enzyme activity
were very close to the values predicted by the Design-Expert software,
for the given design of the study. Further, it is evident that maximum
enzyme production was achieved in run 12 with 0.5 v/v % of onion peel
extract, 0.92 v/v % of garlic peel extract, and 0.2 w/v % l-asparagine.

It is of considerable interest to note the ANOVA analysis
(Supporting Information, Table S2), which
shows
the model p-value to be significant (<0.005) and
model F-value of 7.9, which implies that the value
is significant and there is just 0.19% chance that this large value
could be due to noise. Thus, the noise value is least for the model.
The R2 value (0.597) and the adjusted R2 (0.521) value are almost concurrent. Also,
the adeq. precision value that measures the signal-to-noise ratio
is 9.23 (greater than 4) which is desirable, indicating an adequate
signal and that the model is suitable to navigate the design space.
Moreover, factor B—garlic peel is identified as significant
(p-value < 0.05) in the CCD experiment performed,
which is represented as a linear equation for each of its responses
as given below. 1  where A is the onion peel concn,
B is the
garlic peel concn, and C is the l-asparagine concn.

Further, it is clearly seen from the ANOVA that factor B—garlic
peel extract plays a critical role in enzyme production, and this
may be owing to the fact that the garlic peel contains more of l-asparagine (20%) as seen by the HPLC report (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The analysis results are
represented in three-dimensional surface plots (Figure 1) which displays a linear relationship between
the garlic peel extract and the enzyme activity, though the onion
peel extract and l-asparagine did not show a very significant
change. The images are representative of the key factors influencing
the response based on its p-value.

plots for the CCD design employed for l-asparaginase production
by P. plecoglossicida RS1 using peel
extracts from onion and garlic as media supplements
to enhance the enzyme activity with parameters: (i) garlic peel vs
onion peel and (ii) garlic peel vs l-asparagine (A: onion
peel, B: garlic peel, and C: l-asparagine).

Thus, onion and garlic peels are effective in enhancing
the enzyme
yields in both methods solid-substrate utilization as well as submerged
condition using peel extracts.

Validation of the RSM-Optimized
OG Medium
The maximum-l-asparaginase-producing RSM
run (std. run 12) was replicated
with a higher volume (500 mL) in duplicates, and its responses were
recorded and compared with those of the conventional M-9 medium with
0.3% l-asparagine without any peel supplement and 2% inoculum
at pH 6.8. It was observed that the enzyme activity in the optimized
media was 1.40 ± 0.04 IU/mL. Similarly, the conventional M-9
medium without supplements showed an enzyme activity of 0.599 ±
0.02 IU/mL. It is evidenced that the enzyme activity of the AOG optimized
medium has increased by 2.3-fold. Thus, the statistically optimized
medium may yield better quantity of enzymes by deploying agro wastes,
thus providing waste remediation and industrial economical production
of a commercially important enzyme.

Purification and Characterization
of l-Asparaginase
from the RSM-Optimized OG Medium
The purification process
of l-asparaginase from the RSM-optimized OG medium was initiated
with centrifugation to separate the culture filtrate containing the
extracellular enzyme and the bacteria. Further, precipitation of the
protein using ammonium sulfate (60–80% saturation) and dialyzing
against Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.6 were performed to remove the ammonium
ions introduced by the addition of ammonium sulfate. The purification
summary (Supporting Information, Table
S3) shows a higher yield of about 35%, and an enhanced specific activity
of about fivefold purification is achieved. This is comparatively
a higher yield of enzyme obtained compared to the yield obtained by
purifying l-asparaginase from the same isolate using the
M-9 medium with 0.8% industrial effluent.2 The size of the subunit of the enzyme was observed to be ∼46
kDa (Figure 2a) which
was the same as reported earlier for P. plecoglossicida RS1,2 and the homogeneity was verified
by native and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) analysis. Further, a single band from the native PAGE gel
was excised and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis to obtain peptide sequences
that showed Mascot top score match with l-asparaginase from
the family of Proteobacteria (Supporting Information, Figure S3), the individual sequences were subjected to basic local
alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis, and the four short peptide
sequences obtained 37% identity with an existing Pseudomonas 7A (Figure 2b,c).
Similar reports of identification
of l-asparaginase by MALDI-TOF analysis for the confirmation
of the purified protein were given by Kumar and Selvam.20 Thus, MALDI-TOF analysis is reliable evidence
that confirmed the protein fragments.

Applications of l-Asparaginase
Anticancer Effect of Purified l-Asparaginase Produced
by P. plecoglossicida RS1 on HeLa Cell
Lines
The anticaner activity of l-asparaginase was
studied against human cervical cancer HeLa cell lines. The IC50 of purified l-asparaginase from P. plecoglossicida RS1 was found to be highly effective
against the HeLa cell lines (0.027 IU/mL) in 24 h of treatment (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The cells
showed a complete loss of viability by 36 h of treatment. This value
differs for each cell type, and for HeLa cells, the IC50 value of l-asparaginase from P. plecoglossicida RS1 is less than that of l-asparaginase from Salinicoccus sp. M KJ997975 (IC50 = 0.171
IU/mL) on HeLa cell lines.21 This IC50 value was used for the treatment of HeLa cells for all further
studies.

Study of the Effect of Purified l-Asparaginase on Cell
Cycle of HeLa Cells
To study the cell cycle effect of purified
L-asparaginase on HeLa cells, they were treated with the IC50 value of l-asparaginase determined by the MTT method. l-asparaginase-treated cell line resulted in an increased percentage
of cells in the G2 phase (37%) compared to the untreated
control (3%) and a decreased G1 phase in treated cells
(43%) compared to the control (80%) (Figure 3a). This accumulation at the G2 stage in l-asparaginase-treated cells suggests that the
enzyme halts the ability of the cells to proceed further to M stage
and G2 arrest is suggested as the stage of cell death.
This may be due to the inadequate supply of l-asparagine
which is crucial for protein synthesis to initiate the proceeding
of the cells to the M stage and is quenched by l-asparaginase.
Such a mechanism of cell arrest is reported for some drugs that can
halt cell protein synthesis preceding the M stage.22 The observed molecular mechanism of l-asparaginase
causing G2 arrest in G2–M transition
of the cell cycle may further cause a reduction in some regulatory
cyclins that regulate G2–M transition, and thus l-asparaginase may be responsible for cell death within 24 h
of treatment, which was also reported and corroborated by the earlier
reports.23

(i) control—untreated
and (ii) treated with l-asparaginase showing a large number
of cells halted at the G2 stage. (b) p53 expression in
HeLa cells treated with l-asparaginase analyzed by FACS.
(c) p53 expression in HeLa cells treated with l-asparaginase

effect of different acrylamide concentrations on C.

plate used to observe the chemotactic behavior of NaCl-starved C. elegans: (i) normal nematodes unexposed to acrylamide,
(ii) nematodes exposed to 5 mM acrylamide, and (iii) nematodes coexposed
to 5 mM acrylamide and 6 U l-asparaginase.

Study of p53 Expression in HeLa Cells Treated
with Purified l-Asparaginase
The expression of p53
in L-asparaginase-treated
HeLa cells was observed to be 36.7% as compared to that in the control
(1.6%) (Figure 3b).
This result is corroborated by the immunoblot analysis (Figure 3c) where the expression of
p53 in l-asparaginase-treated HeLa cells is higher compared
to that in the untreated control cells. Such an upregulated p53 expression
due to the treatment by l-asparaginase was previously evidenced
by RT-PCR in human breast cancer MCF-7 and prostate cancer-3 cell
lines.24

It is well-documented that
the tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated in response to DNA damage
to protect the normal cells by inducing the transcription of regulatory
genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair. In most of
the cancer types, the p53 gene is mutated or there is a lack of functional
p53.25 The majority of malignant cervical
cancer cells, including human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells, contain
wild-type p53; however, the rapid degradation of p53 through the ubiquitin–proteasome
pathway by molecules such as the E6 gene product which interacts with
p53 results in similar functional consequences as a mutated p53 gene.26 Therefore, although HeLa cells contain a wild-type
p53 gene expression, they lack functional p53. However, a low level
of leaky transcripts of p53 is seen in untreated HeLa cells which
are also reported earlier.27 Thus, from
the results in this study, it is evident that the p53 expression in
HeLa cells has been upregulated by the treatment of l-asparaginase
produced by P. plecoglossicida RS1.

To conclude the mechanism of cell cycle arrest and p53 expression
studies, l-asparaginase from P. plecoglossicida RS1 had shown a G2 arrest effect when treated with its
IC50 concentration on HeLa cell lines. l-Asparaginase
may have caused severe depletion of proteins required for further
DNA synthesis in the M stage, leading to upregulated p53, which may
have blocked the cells at the G2 checkpoint involving the
inhibition of Cdc2, the cyclin-dependent kinase required to enter
mitosis. Thus, l-asparaginase has an active antiproliferative
property on HeLa cells by inducing p53-dependent G2 arrest.

Effect of Purified l-Asparaginase in Vitro on Polyacrylamide
Inhibition
Acrylamide was declared as a potential carcinogen
by IARC in 1994.28 The toxic effect of
acrylamide is documented in many animal models, and it is reported
to be a reproductive and developmental toxicant in male rodents such
as rats and mice.29 Acrylamides are a degradation
product of polyacrylamide, which causes adulteration of soil and/or
groundwater systems (Public Health 2003) when it is deposited in soil
by anthropogenic ways. The health hazards of acrylamide thus-formed
as an environmental pollutant are well-documented, and the model plant Arabidopsis is prospected to study the effect of
acrylamide.11

In the food industry,
specifically potato food products such as french fries, acrylamide
is formed as a product of maillard reaction and many ways have been
prospected for the inhibition of acrylamide; one of them being used
is l-asparaginase, to cleave off l-asparagine residues,
thus inhibiting the acrylamide formation. The acrylamide mitigation
strategies and their challenges have been extensively studied and
demonstrated.9

In this study, the
use of purified l-asparaginase to inhibit
the acrylamide formation in vitro has been documented. It was observed
that in the absence of l-asparaginase, polymerization of
polyacrylamide occurred at approximately 2.84 min, whereas amide polymerization
was delayed up to 25.71 min when 6 IU/mL enzyme was used (Table 3) which is comparable
to the previous studies where 3 mL of crude l-asparaginase
produced by Bacillus licheniformis was
used.30 Thus, this enzyme, which is capable
of hydrolyzing the free l-asparagine residues and thus mitigating
acrylamide, is of interest in bakery and food industries where polyacrylamide
formation is to be avoided.

Effect of l-Asparaginase on Acrylamide-Exposed C. elegans by Chemotaxis Assay
Biological
systems can serve as an active indicator of toxicity for many chemical
inducers and repressors that are helpful in evaluating their biological
efficacy in vivo. C. elegans is one
such model organism. Acrylamide toxicity and its effect on chemotaxis
plasticity and learning abilities are well-reported.31 Acrylamide toxicity in the range of 1–5 mM has been
studied in C. elegans for the effect
on its chemotactic index. Further, the effect of xenobiotics on chemotaxis
was also studied by Ju et al.32

The
chemotaxis assay was based on the attraction of C.
elegans to NaCl; when impaired by acrylamide, the
chemotaxis of the nematodes toward NaCl decreases dramatically. The
mitigation of acrylamide by purified l-asparaginase produced
by P. plecoglossicida RS1 was studied
by the coexposure of l-asparaginase and acrylamide, which
would result in changes in the chemotactic index of C. elegans.

l-asparaginase-treated C. elegans showed the restoration of chemotactic
index compared to untreated C. elegans exposed to acrylamide (Figure 3d). Further, the path of movement
of C. elegans toward NaCl in untreated
and treated conditions (Figure 3e) shows the restoration of the learning ability and cognitive
skills of the nematodes on treatment by l-asparaginase. Thus,
it can be concluded that the acrylamide level is indeed alleviated
by l-asparaginase, and hence it did not impair the learning
ability in C. elegans coexposed to l-asp and acrylamide. Thus, l-asparaginase produced
by P. plecoglossicida RS1 can be used
for acrylamide mitigation.

Conclusions
Agro
wastes generated by the discarded peels of onion and garlic
were effectively utilized for the economical production of higher
yield (2.3-fold) of l-asparaginase by P. plecoglossicida RS1, by employing statistical modeling studies. The enzyme produced
using the optimized OG peel media was purified to homogeneity, which
was identified and confirmed by MALDI peptide fingerprinting analysis.
Moreover, the application of this purified l-asparaginase
in cytotoxicity of human cervical cancer cells causing a p53-mediated
G2 cell cycle arrest was documented. Further, the mitigation
of toxicant acrylamide was reported both in vitro and also by utilizing
animal model C. elegans for the first
time by the use of the above purified l-asparaginase. Thus, l-asparaginase produced by P. plecoglossicida RS1 can be a potential candidate for commercial production and applications
in both therapeutics and food industry.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial
Culture and Conditions for the Production of l-Asparaginase
Marine isolate P. plecoglossicida RS1 (GenBank ID: KJ508408) positive for the production of l-asparaginase
was cultivated and maintained using an M-9 agar medium with 0.3% l-asparagine. Inoculum preparation of P. plecoglossicida RS1 was done in a liquid M-9 medium containing 0.3% (w/v) l-asparagine; the cell-free supernatant was used as the crude enzyme
source. The enzyme activity was calculated using direct Nessler’s
method33 and represented as IU/mL; the
protein was evaluated (mg/mL) using Lowry’s method; and the
specific activity was expressed as IU/mg of protein.

Production
of l-Asparaginase by Agro-Based Waste Supplementation
Onion
and Garlic Peels for the Production of l-Asparaginase
(Solid-Substrate Utilization)
Dried peels of onion and garlic
(OG) were sterilized and used directly in the M-9 medium without and
with l-asparagine (0.3 w/v %), and P. plecoglossicida RS1 was given as 2% inoculum. l-asparaginase production
was analyzed after 48 h by estimating the enzyme activity of the culture
supernatant used as the crude enzyme.

SEM of OG Peels in the
M-9 Medium
The colonization
of the onion and garlic peel fragments present by P.
plecoglossicida RS1 when grown as submerged culture
in the M-9 medium was visualized after 48 h of incubation by a scanning
electron microscope (TESCAN VEGA III, Czech Republic), where peel
fragments in the uninoculated medium were used as a control. The peel
fragments were sputter-coated with gold particles under vacuum and
observed using an accelerated electron beam at 10 kV.

HPLC Analysis
of Peel Extracts
Dried and powdered onion
and garlic peels were boiled in 0.03 M potassium phosphate monobasic
pH 3.2/acetonitrile (80:20), and the contents were thus extracted.
This extract was maintained as a 30% stock (w/v), sterilized, and
used as a supplement for the production of l-asparaginase
by P. plecoglossicida RS1. The extracts
were also analyzed for their l-asparagine content using HPLC,
on a C-18 column, where the mobile phase was acetonitrile/0.03 M potassium
phosphate, pH 3.2 (20:80), the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, the column
temperature was 30 °C, and the sample volume injected was 20
μL. l-Asparagine was detected at 190 nm.34

Production of l-Asparaginase by P. plecoglossicida RS1 Using Peel Extracts (Submerged
Fermentation)
Different
concentrations of extracts of garlic peel (0.1–1 v/v %) and
onion peel (0.1 g/100 mL to 1 g/100 mL), prepared from 30% stock solution
mentioned above, along with 0.3% (w/v) l-asparagine or without l-asparagine in the M-9 medium (30 mL) were used to study the l-asparaginase production. The medium without onion or garlic
peel extract with 0.3% (w/v) l-asparagine was used as a control.
The incubation was at static conditions at 37 °C for 24 h, and l-asparaginase in terms of enzyme activity and protein and specific
activity was quantified. This study was performed in triplicate analyses.

Statistical Optimization of the Media Components for the Production
of l-Asparaginase by P. plecoglossicida RS1 by RSM, Using CCD.
To optimize the concentrations of
the onion and garlic peel extracts and to analyze their combined effect
on the specific activity of l-asparaginase, the CCD was performed
using Design-Expert
9 as given below (Table 4).

Table 4 Design Summary of RSM Study for Onion
and Garlic Peel Supplementation with l-Asparagine for l-Asparaginase Production
no.	parameter	central value	low values (−1)	high values (+1)	(−α)	(+α)	
A	onion peel ext. (v/v %)	0.5	0.25	0.75	0.08	0.92	
B	garlic peel ext. (v/v %)	0.5	0.25	0.75	0.08	0.92	
C	l-asparagine	0.2	0.15	0.25	0.11	0.28	
According to this design, the total number of treatment combinations
is 2k + 2k + n0, where ‘k’
is the number of independent variables and n0 is the number of replications of the experiments at the central
point. Accordingly, a design was formulated, which comprised three
factors, namely, onion peel extract, garlic peel extract, and l-asparagine with six replicates at the central value. Further,
each run was performed in triplicates, the influence of each component
was evaluated at five coded levels, and responses were evaluated as
enzyme activity (IU/mL). Such a design with three values was formulated
for the RSM study of the same isolate.35 The relationship between the different component factors can be
established as a linear or quadratic equation.

The medium composition
that gave the best enzyme yield was validated
further.

Validation of the Optimized Medium
The optimized concentration
of the individual peel (OG) obtained by CCD was validated in the M-9
medium up to 500 mL, inoculated with 2% (v/v) inoculum of P. plecoglossicida, and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h in static conditions. The yield in terms of enzyme activity was
calculated. The study was carried out in duplicates, and the mean
value was calculated.

Purification and Characterization of the
Enzyme
The
peels and the inoculum P. plecoglossicida were separated from the broth by centrifugation at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. Further, the purification was performed in a stepwise
manner by ammonium sulfate (HiMedia) precipitation (stepwise saturation
from 20 to 80% saturation with 20% increments) and dialysis (against
50 mM Tris-HCl buffer of pH 8.6 in a dialysis membrane-110, HiMedia,
carried out at 4 °C), and the column purification of the protein
was done at 18 °C. The dialyzed protein fraction was then further
applied on diethylaminoethyl sepharose column (bed volume of 30 mL)
and purified to homogeneity. The chromatographic purifications were
analyzed for the protein at 280 nm (BioPhotometer D30, Eppendorf,
Germany).35 The purified fractions of l-asparaginase were pooled and dialyzed with Tris-HCl (50 mM
and pH 8.6) and were stored at −20 °C which were further
used to identify the molecular weight of l-asparaginase by
SDS-PAGE.36 The purity of l-asparaginase
was determined using the standard molecular weight markers of SDS-PAGE
(GeneDireX-BLUltra prestained protein marker).

Characterization of Purified l-Asparaginase by MALDI-TOF
Analysis
MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analyses were performed using a
Bruker Daltonics ULTRAFLEX III (USA). The single band of purified
protein l-asparaginase from native PAGE gel was excised to
small pieces, which were destained until they become translucent white.
The gels were dehydrated using acetonitrile, vacuum-dried, then rehydrated
with dithiothreitol (DTT), and incubated for 1 h. After that, the
DTT solution was removed, and the gel pieces were subjected to iodoacetamide
for 45 min. After incubation, the supernatant was removed and ammonium
bicarbonate solution was added and kept for 10 min. The supernatant
was again removed, and the gel was dehydrated with acetonitrile until
complete dryness. The gel was trypsinized overnight, and the digested
solution was transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, where the gel pieces
were extracted after washing and the removed supernatant was further
collected each time into a fresh Eppendorf and vacuum-dried. The dried
peptide mixture was suspended in Tris-acetate buffer and was mixed
with a HCCA matrix in 1:1 ratio, and from the resulting solution,
2 μL was spotted onto the MALDI plate. After air drying, the
sample was analyzed on the MALDI-TOF/TOF ULTRAFLEX III instrument
and further analyzed with Flex Analysis Software for obtaining the
peptide mass fingerprint. The masses obtained in the peptide mass
fingerprint were submitted for Mascot search in “concerned”
database for the identification of the protein. The peptide fragment
obtained was also subjected to BLAST analysis to identify the protein.

Application of Purified l-Asparaginase as a Anticancer
Agent for Human Cervical Cancer Cells (HeLa Cell Line)
The
purified l-asparaginase from P. plecoglossicida RS1 was tested for anticancer property on human cervical cells of
HeLa cell lines grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (high glucose) (HiMedia, India) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic penicillin/streptomycin
mixture, seeded on 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well),
and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
After attaining confluence (12 h), the cells were treated with purified l-asparaginase (0.005–0.4 IU/mL) produced by P. plecoglossicida RS1 at 37 °C and standard
cell culture conditions and incubated up to 36 h. The untreated HeLa
cells and blank medium were kept as a control. MTT was performed as
per the MTT assay kit (HiMedia, India). The toxic concentration, that
is, IC50 was calculated. IC50 is a drug concentration
which inhibits the growth of cells by 50% relative to an untreated
control.

Cell Cycle Analysis of HeLa Cells Treated with the Purified l-Asparaginase
To study the effect of l-asparaginase
treatment on the cell cycle of HeLa cells, 1 × 106 HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates and grown in DMEM (HiMedia,
India) supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h under standard cell culture
conditions. After the cells attained 80% confluence, six wells were
treated with purified l-asparaginases produced by P. plecoglossicida RS1 and the remaining six wells
were kept untreated as a control and incubated at 37 °C in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Post 24 h of incubation,
the cells were trypsinized, fixed, treated with propidium iodide,
and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSAria III, BD Biosciences, USA).
FlowJo software was used for data analysis and to discriminate the
cell cycle phases.35

Study of p53
Expression in Purified-l-Asparaginase-Treated
HeLa Cells by Flow Cytometry Analysis
Untreated HeLa cells
and cells treated with l-asparaginase were subjected to primary
antibody p53 mouse monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz F2513), followed by
secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat antimouse IgG (H + L) cat
no. A11001 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA). The event of expression
of p53 in treated cells in comparison with control cells was analyzed
using flow cytometry (BD FACSAria III, BD Biosciences, USA) and FlowJo
software and expressed as percentage.

Immunoblot Analysis of l-Asparaginase-Treated HeLa
Cells
HeLa cells were seeded in a 12-well plate, 6 wells
containing HeLa were left untreated, and remaining 6 wells were treated
with l-asparaginase purified from P. plecoglossicida RS1. After 24 h of incubation in standard cell culture conditions,
the cells were scrapped and the protein was extracted using 300 μL
of lysis buffer [Tris-HCl—50 mM, NaCl—150 mM, Triton-X—1%,
sodium deoxycholate 0.5%, SDS 0.1%, DTT—1 mM, PMSF—0.1%,
protease inhibitor cocktail-1× (HiMedia, India)] and incubated
in ice for 1 h, with intermittent vortexing. After 1 h of incubation,
the mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant
was preserved as a total cell protein, and the pellet was discarded.
For immunoblot analysis, 50 μg of protein was loaded per lane
in SDS-PAGE gel, separated elecrtophoretically, and electroblotted
using a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane in transfer buffer containing
20% (v/v) methanol, 192 mM glycine, and 25 mM Tris at pH 8.3 at 90
mV for 90 min. Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked
with 5% skimmed milk for 60 min. The membrane was then treated with
monoclonal antibody specific to human p53 (Santa Cruz F2513), diluted
to 1:1000, and was then incubated overnight. Further, the membrane
was washed with Tris buffer saline-TWEEN 20 (TBS-T) and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody specific
to p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz SC-2005) for 1 h. Thereafter,
the membrane was washed with TBS-T, and the presence of p53 was visually
detected on the membrane by the addition of developing solutions,
solution-1—12 mg of DAB (3,3′,4,4′-tetra amino
biphenyl tetra hydrochloride), a colored substrate made in 18 mL of
0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, along with 2 mL of solution-2 made of 0.3%
NiCl2 and 0.3% H2O2. All steps were
carried out at 20 °C. The molecular weight of
the protein bands was calculated by comparison with an SDS-PAGE marker
(GeneDireX, Taiwan).

Application of the Purified l-Asparaginase
for the
Degradation of Acrylamide
In Vitro Study of Acrylamide Degradation
by l-Asparaginase
Purified from P. plecoglossicida RS1
Inhibition of polyacrylamide formation using l-asparaginase
produced by P. plecoglossicida RS1
was demonstrated by standard methods in vitro as described by Shakambari
et al. and Mahajan et al.30,35 The time taken for
the polymerization of acrylamide solution was noted for different
concentrations of l-asparaginase used.

Demonstration
of the Effect of Acrylamide Mitigation by l-Asparaginase
Using C. elegans as a Live Animal Model
Chemotaxis assay was carried out
modifying a method described previously by Saeki et al.37 Accordingly, C. elegans (n = 200 per replicate;
three replicates per group) was exposed (48 h) to 5 mL of sublethal
concentrations of acrylamide (0, 1, 2.5, and 5 mM) as reported previously
by Ju et al. in the six-well plates
for 48 h at 20 °C.32 Another set of
nematodes was exposed to acrylamide (0, 1, 2.5, and 5 mM) along with l-asparaginase (6 U) for 48 h under aforementioned conditions.
After 48 h of exposure, M-9 buffer was used to wash the nematodes
and the nematode groups were further starved for NaCl for 3 h in M-9
buffer. After 3 h, the nematodes were transferred to the assay plates
(5 mM K phosphate, pH 6.0, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, and 20 g/L agar), and three points were marked equidistant from
each other as vertices of a triangle, as S—starting point,
N—NaCl + NaN3, C—control (NaN3 alone). Nematodes were transferred to the S point of the plate and
incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. After 30 min, the nematodes were
anesthetized by the presence of NaN3, and the numbers of
nematodes at the zone with NaCl and those without NaCl were counted
for each group. The chemotactic index was calculated by the formula
(the number within the NaCl gradient – the number within the
control)/the total number of animals on the plate.37
