Development of highly efficient nanowire-based
photovoltaic devices
requires an accurate modeling of light scattering from interfaces
and optical carrier generation inside the cell. A comprehensive study
of optical absorption and carrier generation enables us to tap the
full potential of nanowire arrays (NWAs). In this study, we have done
a systematic study to optimize the core–shell structure of
vertically aligned silicon nanowire (Si NW) arrays coated with PTB7:PC71BM by means of finite difference time domain optical simulations
to maximize the photon absorption. Initially, the core thickness of
hybrid Si NWs has been optimized for the most efficient light absorption.
The further improvement of light absorption has been studied by varying
the coating thickness of low-band gap organic polymer PTB7:PC71BM on Si NWAs. A delineative analysis shows that NWs with
a 150 nm thick silicon core and 60 nm thick coating of PTB7:PC71BM exhibit broad band absorption and the optimum ideal current
density of about 34.95 mA/cm2, which are larger than those
of their planar counterpart with the same amount of absorbing material
and also better than those previously reported for NWs. The basic
principle and the physical process taking place during absorption
and current generation have been also discussed. The optimization
of the hybrid heterojunction Si NW arrays and understanding of their
optical characteristics may contribute to the development of economical
and highly efficient hybrid solar cells.

1 Introduction
The
recent advances in the semiconductor nanowire array (NWA) technology
provide new opportunities to realize economical and highly efficient
photovoltaic (PV) devices because of their distinctive unidimensional
geometry with striking electrical and optical features.1−5 It has been observed that Si NWA-based solar cells have a higher
efficiency limit than planar cells because the restricted aperture
of Si NWAs suppresses the optical and entropy losses.6,7 The vertically grown  nanowires (NWs) provide an elongated
optical path which  enhances the photon absorption.3 Because the diameter of the  NWs is of the
order of the wavelength of the incident wave, it subdues optical reflection
over the wide spectral range.8 This reduces
the time and cost of anti-reflection coating imperative in planar
PV structures.9,10 Moreover, the Si NWA structures
provide high collection probability because charge separation occurs
in the radial orientation. Such optically favorable design principles
of Si NWAs substantially surpass the conventional Shockley–Queisser
efficiency limit.11 Different types of
the Si NWA-based heterojunction have been studied by varying the doping
concentration and embedding carbon quantum dots and the Schottky junction
based on graphene nanoribbons for improved efficiency of Si NWA-based
PV devices.12,13 These studies show that the morphological
and geometrical improvements of Si NWAs enhance their inherent properties
of the elongated optical path, radial carrier transportation, reduced
optical reflection, and exaggerated surface area which give them an
upper hand over planar geometry-based solar cells.14,15

Recently, hybrid polymer-/NW-based solar cells have attracted
a
lot of interest because they are significant in the endeavor to develop
inexpensive, mass-producible, and lightweight solar cells.15−18 Many groups have studied hybrid NW/P3HT (binary blend)17,19 structures, but the maximum efficiency of a binary blend single-junction
device is limited to 12% because of the limited optical absorption
and low charge transfer of the photoactive layer.18 To overcome this limitation, researchers are attempting
to develop ternary blend organic PVs.18,20−22 Here, polymers of contrasting electron affinities and ionization
potentials are blended together.23 These
ternary blend hybrid structures form dispersed heterojunctions that
can significantly generate excitons within diffusion lengths.24,25 For the better light harvesting, dissociation of excitons is an
essential step in the production of free carriers; however, photoinduced
excitons should be produced in the diffusion length range of the heterojunction
interface. Extensive studies of the dispersed heterojunction-based
solar cells reveal that their efficiencies are determined by their
nanoscale morphologies.24,26−28 Despite numerous geometrical advantages and administering all morphological
issues of dispersed heterojunction-based silicon nanowire (Si NW)
solar cells,29,30 they have been less efficient
and have relatively found less commercial relevance compared to the
conventional bulk silicon solar cells.31−34 The absence of properly optimized
structures may be the main reason behind that. Further development
of hybrid Si NW/polymer-based solar cells requires sheathing of an
organic polymer which can efficiently harvest the major part of the
solar spectrum.35,36

The analysis of NW-based
PV devices requires an accurate modeling
of light scattering from interfaces and optical carrier generation
inside the cell for efficient light harvesting. The processes that
contribute to their absorption are interrelated and highly dispersive,
so the only current method of optimizing the absorption is by intensive
numerical calculations.37 In view of this,
here, we have done geometrical optimizations and a systematic study
of optical characteristics of low-band gap organic polymer PTB7:PC71BM-coated Si NWAs to capitalize optical absorption. The finite
difference time domain (FDTD) simulated generation rates, and ideal
short-circuit current densities have been studied for different core–shell
combinations to optimize the proposed hybrid structures. The detailed
analysis shows that the optical absorptance is maximum only for a
singular combination of the core and the shell. The basic principle
and the physical process taking place during absorption and current
generation have also been discussed.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the three-dimensional schematic of 5 μm long, 3 × 3 Si
NWAs/PTB7:PC71BM, which is equivalent to the density of
6.25 × 108 NWs/cm2. The variation of average
optical absorptance for different lengths of NWs has been simulated
and shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S4. The optimized length of NWs obtained is 5 μm. Figure 1b represents the
actual two-dimensional lengthwise cross section of the nanowire in
which the FDTD simulation was executed. While applying an FDTD simulation
region, perfectly matching layer (PML) boundaries were also implemented
to diminish the interior reflections completely. A solar analysis
group was set over the absorbing region of NWAs to calculate the exciton
generation rate. Finally, two monitors were placed, one above the
light source and the other below the substrate to measure optical
reflectance and optical transmittance, respectively.

of three-dimensional periodic PTB7:PC71BM-coated 3 ×
3 silicon NWAs under FDTD simulation and
(b) two-dimensional transverse cross section of simulated nanowires
with polymer coating.

Figure 2i
represents
optical reflectance (R) of hybrid Si NWA/PTB7:PC71BM structures without and with varying organic coating across
the predominant part of the solar spectrum. A conspicuous amount of
reflectance is observed over the complete region for bare Si NWAs.
For wavelengths up to 560 nm and beyond 950 nm, the optical reflectance
decreases continuously as the organic coating thickness is increased.
In the wavelength zone of 700–950 nm, the optical reflectance
undulates and behaves in contrast to lower and higher wavelength regions.
In this wavelength zone, optical reflection increases as the coating
thickness increases. The optical reflectance peak surpasses the
bare Si NWA peak at the optimum coating thickness of 60 nm. Overall,
the hybrid Si NWAs/PTB7:PC71BM assembly has exceptionally
low optical reflectance for coating thicknesses of 60 nm, with the
peak not exceeding 15%, in contrast to bare Si NWAs and other extensively
studied hybrid NWAs structures.

curves of (a) uncoated
150 nm Si NW core and with PTB7:PC71BM coating of thickness
(b) 20, (c) 60, and (d) 80 nm.

Figure 2ii
represents
optical transmittance (T) for uncoated Si NWAs with
and without PTB7:PC71BM coating as a function of wavelength.
Coating initially increases and subsequently reduces the optical transmission,
hitting the lowest of 5% transmittance for 60 nm thick PTB7:PC71BM coating in the higher frequency region. In the low frequency
region, sharp rises and falls are observed in the optical transmittance.
Overall, optical transmission for the proposed structure offers 20%
lower optical transmission than bare Si NWAs.

The optical absorptance
(A) is estimated using
the energy balance relation A(λ) = 1 – R(λ) – T(λ). Figure 3 shows the optical
absorptance of uncoated and PTB7:PC71BM-coated Si NWAs
with respect to the wavelength. For all wavelengths under 700 nm and
beyond 950 nm, as the thickness of the photoactive shell increases,
optical absorptance reaches the maximum for an optimum coating of
60 nm. For the wavelength band of 700–950 nm, optical absorptance
fluctuates because of unsteady optical reflection in this wavelength
region. Overall, Si NWAs/PTB7:PC71BM have wide and enhanced
optical absorption ranging from the low to high wavelength region
which is foremost to take complete advantage of any NWA-based PV structure.
This can be explained by using the following electrostatic approximation:
the enhanced optical absorption as a function of the wavelength for
bare Si NWAs is given by35,38 |Ecore/Einc|2 = |2εext/(εext + εcore)|2, where εext = 1 (permittivity of air), Einc is the electric field intensity of the incident
light, and Ecore is the electric field
intensity of the Si NW core. At the incident light of 600 nm wavelength,
εcore = (15.590 + 0.216j), which gives |Ecore/Einc|2 = 0.014.
When the optimized layer of PTB7:PC71BM is coated on silicon
NWAs, the expression of enhanced absorption modifies to |Ecore/Einc|2 = |2εext/(εext + εcoat)|2|2εcoat/(εcore + εcoat)|2, where εcoat = (3.605 + 1.283j) for
the incident light of 600 nm wavelength,31 which gives |Ecore/Einc|2 = 0.026. By these calculations, we can
see that about 1.9 times enhancement in optical absorption can be
obtained with a 60 nm organic shell than the uncoated Si NWs. This
explains the observed enhancement in optical absorption for Si NWs/PTB7:PC71BM, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Optical absorptance curves of (a) uncoated 150 nm Si NW
core and
with PTB7:PC71BM coating of thickness (b) 20, (c) 60, and
(d) 80 nm.

The average optical absorptance
(%) values of hybrid Si NWAs for
different Si NW core thicknesses such as 110, 130, 150, 160, and 170
nm and for different PTB7:PC71BM shell thicknesses are
summarized in Table S1 given in the Supporting Information. It is observed that the shell with 60 nm thickness
offers the highest average optical absorptance of nearly 96% for all
cores. If the thickness of the shell is further increased, optical
absorptance falls gradually. Surprisingly, it is observed that for
constant shell thickness of 60 nm and with decreasing core thickness,
there is a minor increase in the average optical absorptance. So,
we have also considered all these structures for further optimization
of PV charge generation.

A rapid exciton generation rate and
prompt carrier separation are
the prerequisites for a superior PV material.39 Mathematically, the exciton generation rate (G)
is given by G = ∫over simulated region(Pabs/ℏω). Figure 4a,b shows the simulated optical
power absorption per unit volume (Pabs) and simulated exciton generation rate (G), respectively,
in the logarithmic scale for an optimized Si NW with a core thickness
of 150 nm and a coating thickness of 60 nm. Here, a choropleth approach
is used to demonstrate the strength and distribution of guided modes
along the NW length. These plots illustrate the opulent optical confinement
along the entire height of NWs. The simulations performed for the
5 μm long and 150 nm thick Si NW core and for varying coating
thickness of PTB7:PC71BM under broad solar irradiance of
300–1100 nm have been shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S5a,b. A delineative analysis of Figure S5a,b shows that NWs with a 150 nm thick
silicon core and 60 nm thick coating of PTB7:PC71BM exhibit
the optimum generation rate, which is in contrast to other core–shell
structures.

silicon core coated with 60 nm thick PTB7:PC71BM organic
shells, and (c) schematic of light propagation and carrier generation
in the proposed core–shell structure.

Figure 4c
shows
the schematic of light propagation and carrier generation in the proposed
core–shell structure; yellow arrows show the elongated optical
path in the axial direction. White arrows represent the radial carrier
transportation and the blue-colored structure represents the formation
of the standing wave at optimum thickness of the core and the shell.
The main aim of optimizing the core–shell geometry is to synchronize
optical field’s standing wave nodes with the heterojunction
interface, which is schematically shown in Figure 4c. This process boosts the carrier separation
process and utilizes the maximum length of the NWAs.40,41

The pragmatic application of an organic coating of thickness
nearly
half of the coat thickness provides optimum light absorption, exciton
generation, and free carrier transportation. These hybrid Si NWAs/PTB7:PC71BM allow a high amount of photons to scatter in the structure
and give them further chances to generate electron–hole pairs
to make use of the entire incident light on the cell without the need
for an additional light-trapping mechanism such as surface texturing.
The ideal short-circuit current density (Isc) for NWAs with varying Si core thicknesses and a 60 nm thick shell
of PTB7:PC71BM at zero external voltage is shown in Figure 5. The Isc initially undulates and then increases steadily with
a peak at 34.95 mA/cm2 for a 150 nm thick core coated with
a 60 nm thick PTB7:PC71BM shell and then drops continuously
for thicker configurations of cores. This shows the optimized structure
that shows maximum Isc. The current generation
process in these hybrid Si NW heterojunctions is shown in Figure 6. When an electron
donor polymer (PTB7) and an electron acceptor polymer (PC71BM) are brought in contact, a regional field develops at their interface.
This regional field accelerates all the excitons produced within the
diffusion length to the interface, where they dissociate. As a result,
charge separation is far more efficient at the heterojunction interface.
The hybrid Si NWAs have the efficient ability of charge carrier transfer
to the electrodes without losses due to recombination at boundaries.
Also, in the PTB7:PC71BM interface, the interface dipole
and the band bending are absent because of their identical charge
neutrality levels. Because of the above-stated reasons, these hybrid
Si NWs/PTB7:PC71BMs show better ideal Isc. The principle and the processes followed here to achieve
an optimum core–shell combination are also valid for all hybrid
NWA-based PV devices.

nm thick PTB7:PC71BM organic shells.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the optical attributes of the PTB7:PC71BM-coated Si NWAs
were studied using the FDTD method with an aim
to optimize the PV charge generation. In comparison to other core–shell
combinations, it was observed that the bare Si NWs core of 150 nm
thickness exhibits the optimum optical absorption. However, with PTB7:PC71BM organic low-band gap polymer coating on the 150 nm Si
NW core, a phenomenal optical absorption was observed. A detailed
analysis shows that NWAs with a 150 nm thick silicon core and 60 nm
thick coating of PTB7:PC71BM exhibit broad band absorption.
A delineative analysis of optical generation rates of these optimized
structures shows higher light-harvesting properties. The optimized
hybrid structures of the 150 nm thick Si NW core with a 60 nm thick
PTB7:PC71BM shell exhibit the optimum ideal photogenerated
current of about 34.95 mA/cm2, which is larger than the
planar counterpart42 with the same amount
of absorbing material and also better than that previously reported
for NWs.37,42 This study indicates that hybrid Si NWA-based
solar cells are likely to have greater efficiency than planar solar
cells, thereby raising the position of hybrid Si NWAs for the practical
experiment of the promising hybrid solar cells.

4 Computational
Methods
In this article, the optical simulations for Si NWAs/PTB7:PC71BM have been performed by means of the FDTD method. The FDTD
is a state-of-art grid-based numerical analysis technique that works
out Maxwell’s differential equations for intricate geometries
by employing temporal and spacial discretization using central difference
approximations to perform optical simulations. Maxwell curl equations
associate the changes in electric/magnetic field in time with the
changes in the magnetic/electric field over space, respectively. This
resembles the basic FDTD forward development-in-time relationship.
Now, anywhere in space, a forward time-stepped value of the electric
field can be determined by the localized spatially distributed magnetic
field and by the previously evaluated value of the electric field.
In a similar manner, the magnetic field can also be developed in time
to compose a continuous electromagnetic wave. These nibbles of the
electric field and magnetic field are time-developed numerically in
every Yee-cell under various conformal boundary conditions to evaluate
different optical attributes. We adopt the PML boundary condition
and normal irradiance of the standard AM 1.5 G profile as a plane
wave source. The n-type Si NWs of the doping concentration 2.3 ×
1014 cm–3 are simulated here. The chemical
structure and the composition of polymer PTB7:PC71BM have
been shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S1a,b. The refractive indices31,38 of Si and PTB7:PC71BM are shown in Figures S2 and S3
in the Supporting Information, respectively,
for a wavelength span of 300–1100 nm. Optical absorptance,
power absorbed per unit volume, exciton generation rate, and ideal
short-circuit current density have been simulated for a broad spectral
range of 300–1100 nm wavelength.
