Hybrid poly(hydroxy urethane)s
(PHUs) are synthesized by copolymerizing aromatic/alicyclic cyclic
carbonates with a polyether amine via addition polymerization. They
result into polymers with an average molecular weight of 10 kDa and
exhibit solubility in common organic solvents. The hybrid PHUs display Tg up to 18 °C. PHUs are enriched with multiple
H-bonded interactions and they are assessed using temperature-dependent 1H NMR and Fourier-transform infrared studies. PHUs possess
folded-sheet morphology with nanogap between folds and nanowidth between
chains. The secondary interactions bestow thermoreversible property
to PHUs, and they display good adhesion to both polar (Al–Al)
and nonpolar (HDPE–HDPE) substrates. Hybrid PHUs show improved
optical transparency compared to homo PHUs. The PHUs are thermally
stable up to 250 °C.

1 Introduction
Polyurethanes
are versatile polymers; they find various applications
from cushions, beds, and biomedical devices to high-tech aerospace
needs.1,2 According to 2016 database, an average of
18 metric ton per year is the global demand for polyurethanes. Although
huge application exists, their synthesis is nongreen due to the use
of harmful aromatic or aliphatic isocyanates. The isocyanates are
extremely harmful to human health and environment, continuous exposure
to which results in severe lung irritation, occupational asthma, contact
dermatitis, etc. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has
classified 2,4-toludenediisocyanate as a possible human carcinogen.
Recently, polyurethanes derived from nonisocyanate route (polyhydroxy
urethanes-PHUs) have been emerged as a potential area of research.3−7 Polyhydroxy urethanes (PHUs) can be synthesized by different routes:
the mainly employed routes are (i) trans-urethinization between bicarbamate
and a diol, (ii) aziridine copolymerization with CO2, and
(iii) ring-opening polyaddition between a bicyclic carbonate and a
diamine. Among these methods, the most employed and studied is the
third one because it is highly economical from the industrial point
of view and carries a green aspect too. The synthesis of bicyclic
carbonate from bisepoxy and CO2 is an important reaction
strategy since it helps in the chemical fixation of CO2. On the other hand, global warming is ballooning as a big threat,
where CO2 is the main culprit (carbon dioxide evolved from
various human-intervened processes).8,9 Avoiding isocyanate
chemistry and employing CO2 gas in the chemical transformation
route to obtain polyurethane is a useful and interesting approach.
Reports point out that if CO2 is used for PHU synthesis
and considering overall consumption of PHU, CO2 emission
can be reduced by 120 million tons per year. Step-growth polyaddition
of cyclic carbonates to di/multiamines is a viable and notable technique
to produce poly(hydroxy urethane)s (PHUs). The cyclic carbonate monomers
are synthesized by chemical insertion of CO2 into naturally
abundant (soybean oil, epoxidized fatty acid diesters, vegetable oils,
lignin, etc.) or synthetically (methyl-9-decenoate,5-(2-propenyl)-1,3-dioxan-2-one,
4-(3-propenyl)-1,3-dioxan-2-one, 6-methyl-1,3,5-diozazocan-2-one)
made epoxide-containing molecules.10−24 Although thermoplastic, thermosets, and elastomers are synthesized
based on PHU, smart properties are rarely achieved on PHUs.

Recent studies focus mainly to understand polymer synthesis and
properties of resultant PHU polymers25−42 (Figure 1). In 2018,
two interesting works were reported with fascinating reworkable properties
on PHUs.44,45 PHU-containing acetal group undergoes acid-catalyzed
reversibility in solvents.43,44 By using cystamine as comonomer, reprocessable PHUs were achieved
at 150 °C.45 The work features the
retrieval of original cross-link density after reprocessing the PHU.

by different groups.

PHUs with smart properties
are essential for challenging applications
in various sectors. In the present work, a novel thermoreversible
nonisocyanate hybrid PHU was presented. Combinations of aromatic-
and alicyclic-based cyclic carbonates were polymerized together with
a suitable amine to result folded-sheet superstructures. H-bonding
and self-assembly of polar/nonpolar PHU chains in hybrid PHUs were
investigated by temperature-dependent 1H NMR and Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) techniques. Morphological changes of PHUs were studied
by temperature-controlled polarized light microscopy (PLM) and by
field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Reworkable adhesive
properties of PHUs were evaluated on both polar and nonpolar substrates.
Additionally, reversibility of superstructures in PHUs was confirmed
by temperature-dependent spectral and PLM studies.

2 Results and Discussion
The compositions of PHUs are given
in Table 1. The chemical
structure of monomers is shown
in Figure 2. After
the polymerization, all samples exhibited two peaks corresponding
to −CO groups. One was observed at 1702 cm–1 and the other at 1798 cm–1 (Figure 4a). The former peak is attributed to −CO
peak of urethane linkage, and the latter one is ascribed to the −CO
group of unreacted cyclic carbonate group.46 Characteristic signal of the −CO group confirmed the formation
of PHU, which is evident from FTIR spectra. A typical drawback of
all PHUs is that polymerization will be stopped after attaining a
certain molecular weight.47−51 Further polymer chain growth will be very difficult (due to steric
and electronic reasons). The present samples were subsequently analyzed
for average molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
It is noted that reasonably high molecular weight was achieved by
polymerization. The independent PHUs (BACY 10 and BACY 01) and hybrid
PHUs (BACY 73, BACY 55, and BACY 37) attained a molecular weight of
about 10 kDa (Table S1). From GPC results,
it is clearly observed that these PHUs have relatively significant
molecular weight to exhibit polymer properties. This study further
confirms that no reduction in average molecular weight occurred in
hybrid PHUs vis-a-vis independent PHUs. The chain structures of homo
(Figure S1) and hybrid PHUs (Figure 3) are given.

Nonisocyanate polyurethanes
(NIPUs) were synthesized by curing
of limonene dicarbonate with Priamine 1074, which gave a molecular
weight (Mn) of 4300 g/mol.46 Studies on the curing of diglyceroldicarbonate
(DGC) with isoiodide diamine resulted in PHUs with Mn = 4900 g/mol.48 A bisfuranic
hydroxy urethane monomer was synthesized and polymerized with a poly(propylene
oxide)-bismaleimide to yield an NIPU with a molecular weight of 4300
g/mol.49 Ricinoleic acid-derived primary
amide was oxidized in situ to isocyanate intermediate by an organic
oxidant iodosobenzene, which subsequently self-condensed resulting
in PHUs with Mn = 1300 g/mol.50 Studies are available where PHUs of higher Mn (>5000 g/mol) were reported via different
methods. PHUs of higher molecular weight (9200–13 500
g/mol) were produced by the reaction of diglyceroldicarbonate (DGC)
with different amines such as butane-1,4-diamine (BDA), pentane-1,5-diamine,
nonane-1,9-diamine, and dimerized fatty acid diamine.48 Terepthallic biscyclo carbonate with amines (jeffamine
D2000/1,4-butanediamine (BDA)) in different ratios yielded thermoplastic
nonisocyanate polyurethane with Mn ranging
from 9850 to 10 750 g/mol.51 Hence,
PHUs achieved in the above possess reasonably high molecular weight
(∼10 kDa)

In the next step, solubilities of hybrid PHUs
were evaluated in
both polar and nonpolar solvents (Table S2). The hybrid PHU (and independent aromatic/aliphatic PHUs) exhibited
good solubility in ethanol, acetone, ethylacetate, and dimethyl sulfoxide.
All samples were soluble in a time of 1 h at room temperature in the
above-mentioned solvents. This indicates that the polymer chains were
entangled sufficiently but not cross-linked. This is a positive signature
that the PHUs can be used for further reaction or processing of new
materials. To understand the segmental motions of PHUs, they were
subjected to differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies in inert
atmosphere. The Tg’s of PHUs increased
with the incorporation of aromatic-rich segments. The Tg’s of BACY 10 (aromatic moiety alone) and BACY
01 (aliphatic moiety alone) were only about 5 °C, as determined
from DSC profiles (Figure S2). However,
with the addition of BACC into CYCC, Tg’s were enhanced up to 18 °C, as seen in BACY 55. In
BACY 73, Tg was reduced to 12 °C.
Generally, no increase in Tg was expected
in hybrid PHUs unless otherwise secondary forces exist.

The
homo PHUs possess almost same molecular weights and Tg’s (Tg’s
of homo PHU derived from BACC and CYCC are only ca. 5 °C). The
increase in Tg in hybrid PHUs is attributed
to enhanced interactions between polymer chains. The secondary interactions
such as H-bonding may play a crucial role in determining the thermal
properties and morphology (vide infra). Further, single Tg’s of hybrid PHUs confirm the formation of single
polymeric chain made up of both aromatic and aliphatic segments. In
another way, the polymerization occurred in a hybrid manner and no
independent PHU exists in the copolymer. This is the rationale for
the absence of two Tg’s and the
presence of a single Tg in hybrid PHUs.
Additionally, PHUs were subjected to softening point evaluation since
no melting endotherm was observed in DSC. All of the PHUs exhibited
a softening tendency at about 80–100 °C, and the softening
temperature was not sharp but wide (Figure S3). This is a very significant information that hybrid PHUs cannot
flow (do not show melting endotherm in DSC too), but restricted chain
movement is possible. This restriction is ascribed to the secondary
interactions, which can give temperature-dependent polymer properties.

The synergetic effect observed in Tg is attributed to increased polymer chain interactions present in
hybrid PHU or increased chain rigidity. In addition, the absence of
sharp-melting-point endotherm in DSC indicates the absence of long-range
order in PHUs. Further, X-ray diffraction patterns imply the amorphous
nature of hybrid PHUs (Figure S4). All
of these evidences lead to the thought that increased segmental stability
is due to ordered regions, which exist locally via H-bonds. H-bonding
is possible between secondary and primary hydroxyl groups or −NH
of urethane groups or −CO groups. In the first step of understanding
H-bonding present in PHUs, 1H NMR investigation was carried
(Figure 4b). Since the hybrid PHUs flow at 80–100 °C,
a temperature regime of 30–90 °C was considered under
the assumption that this regime will be the most suitable range for
H-bonding studies. The signals corresponding to −NH (6.9 ppm)
of urethane shifted to upfield with increase in temperature and finally
returned to original position when cooled to 30 °C. To corroborate
this observation, signals at 3.6 ppm (−OH groups) also tracked
such that they got shifted in the same fashion to the upfield and
reached back to the original position by cooling to 30 °C (Figure 4b). This is a clear
indication that primary or secondary −OH groups and −NH
of urethane are involved in H-bonding. However, the −CO group
of urethane is a very strong H-bond acceptor that can definitely participate
in H-bonding. The participation of −CO groups in H-bonding
was investigated by variable-temperature FTIR spectroscopy.

Figure 4 (a) FTIR spectra
of homo and hybrid PHUs indicating the presence
of −CO group of poly(hydroxy urethane)s and unreacted cyclic
carbonate group. (b) 1H NMR spectra of BACY 55 upon heating
from 30 to 90 °C and cooling back to 30 °C.

The BACY 55 PHU was heated from 30 to 100 °C and FTIR
spectra
were recorded at 30, 60, 90, and 100 °C and after cooling to
30 °C (Figure 5a). Notable spectral shifts were observed, which provided valuable
insights into the H-bonded interactions. Four distinct spectral regions
were focused for explaining the ordered/disordered carbonyl H-bonding.
Generally, in polyureas, the ordered H-bonded domain appears below
1650 cm–1(due to bifurcated H-bonding), whereas
polyurethanes exhibit still higher frequency of about 1711 cm–1.52 The present system
consists of −CO, −OH, and −NH groups (multiple
H-bond donors and acceptors). The region corresponding to 1697–1705
cm–1 is attributed to H-bonded C=O in ordered
domain. Two peaks were present in the FTIR spectra (at 30 °C
and also when cooled to 30 °C) of PHU, one oriented at 1697 cm–1 and the other at 1705 cm–1. These
regions are related to ordered domains. It is to be noted that these
H-bonded ordered domains observed at 1697 and 1705 cm–1 were always present at all temperatures studied. This is a clear
observation that, ordering due to H-bonding is not fully vanished
with increase in temperature (i.e., there is a high possibility of
breaking of H-bonds with rise in temperature). It means that H-bonds
break and form with other available H-bonding sites with increasing
temperature. This is possible because vast H-bonding groups are present
in PHUs. With increase in temperature, new peaks were noted at 1716
and 1722 cm–1. We assume the peak observed at 1716
cm–1 is associated with disordered domain since
the intensity of that peak increases drastically with increase in
temperature (see the peak at 100 °C and the peak at 1716 cm–1 evolved significantly at 100 °C). At 30 °C,
the peaks at 1716 and 1722 cm–1 were absent or merged
with each other. The inference is that more ordering occurred at 30
°C and degree of ordering changed with increase in temperature.
But complete absence of ordered domain is not possible since multiple
H-bonding occurs in hybrid PHUs. Due to this, PHU exhibits restricted
flow at higher temperature (softening only). Additionally, −OH
and −NH groups were examined in FTIR spectra. The −NH
or OH peaks were oriented about 3400 cm–1 at 30
°C, which moved to higher frequency (ca. 3450 cm–1) on progressive heating. When cooled to 30 °C, the peak was
returned to 3400 cm–1 range due to the formation
of H-bonding. The increased frequency peak with increase in temperature
is due to the breaking of H-bonds. This study reveals the participation
of −OH and −NH groups toward hydrogen bonding along
with −CO groups in PHUs.

A next interesting aspect is
whether hybrid nature of PHU has any
impact on H-bonding or ordering phenomenon. To see that, BACY 10 and
BACY 01 (both are homo PHUs) were subjected to temperature-variable
FTIR studies (Figure S5) as carried out
for BACY 55. On studying the FTIR spectra of BACY 01, the region of
−C=O group gave a peak with wide distribution at 1740–1650
cm–1. On heating, peaks were evolved in both higher
and lower frequencies but less intense (at 100 °C). This is due
to lesser degree of H-bonding in BACY 01. To corroborate the low level
of H-bonding in BACY 01, −NH/–OH region was examined
and found that no significant change was noted in the peak position.
Peaks at 30 °C and 100 °C exhibited wide distribution, and
this wide peak was oriented near to 3450 cm–1 (however,
intensity increased considerably at 100 °C). Surprisingly, no
significant peak change was noted in the −CO and −OH/NH
region of BACY 10 with increase in temperature. The FTIR studies reveal
the prominence of H-bonding in hybrid PHU compared to homo PHUs. This
enhanced H-bonding can offer special properties and enhanced mechanical
features to hybrid PHUs. This observation is further confirmed by
rheological studies. The hybrid PHU (BACY 55) was subjected to heating
(50–150 °C) and cooling back to 50 °C in a rotational
rheometer (plate–plate assembly) where the polymer completely
regained the original viscosity (Figure S6). The heating/cooling cycle was repeated and no appreciable change
in viscosity was observed. This repeatability implies the reassembly
of PHUs where H-bonded domains play a crucial role. Possible H-bonding
interactions (representative structures) are shown in Figure 5b.

to 100 °C and on cooling to 30 °C, with (A) showing changes
in −CO bonding and (B) showing changes in −NH/OH groups
in PHUs. (b) Possible chain structure of hybrid PHUs showing secondary
interactions.

To study the self-assembly behavior
and differentiate assembly
pattern due to the incorporation of aromatic/aliphatic units in the
polymer chain, FESEM of each composition was imaged. It is evident
from the images that aliphatic PHU (BACY 01) and aromatic PHU (BACY
10) feature a smooth surface with folded-sheet morphology (Figure 6). The layer thickness
is in the order of 500 nm. This morphology is attributed to multiple
hydrogen bonding reported elsewhere.52 It
is well established that H-bonding can give different orientations.

Figure 6 FESEM
images of homo and hybrid PHUs: (A) BACY 10, (B) BACY 73,
(C) BACY 55, (D) BACY 37, and (E) BACY 01.

By comparing the folded structures of BACY 10 and BACY 01, BACY
10 possessed a closely aligned sheet structure, whereas BACY 01 exhibited
less folding. On the other way, folding density is higher for BACY
10, which may be due to the additional π–π interaction
(due to aromatic nature) in association with H-bonding. When aliphatic
content was incorporated via tandem polymerization of BACC and CYCC
(i.e., BACY 73), folded sheets become closer and roughness was introduced.
In the hybrid BACY 55, the folded-sheet formation was intensified
and folding density was high compared to other hybrids. The highly
populated sheet formation was composition-dependent, and surface revealed
rough morphology. When the hybrid became aliphatic-rich (BACY 37),
close alignment of polymer chains was difficult due to lack of secondary
interactions, which finally gave folded sheets similar to BACY 10
and BACY 01 PHUs. As a single Tg was observed
for hybrid PHUs (BACY 37, BACY 55, and BACY 73), it is concluded that
a single polymer matrix exists in hybrid where aliphatic or aromatic
backbones are competing each other to self-assemble in the hybrid
polymer due to their thermodynamically incompatible nature.

When assessed the width of folds and gap between folds, interesting
observations were noted (Figure S7). In
both BACY 10 and BACY 01 (nonhybrid PHUs), widths of folds were in
micron level, but in hybrid PHUs, widths were reduced to nano-level.
In BACY 55 (Figure 6C inset), the widths of folds were <200 nm. In addition, we have
tried to obtain the gap between folds, which were also in the range
of 100–200 nm in BACY 55 PHU. In other hybrids BACY 37 and
BACY 73, the fold gaps were in the range of 500–700 nm. This
unraveled that, hybrid PHUs were aligned closer or self-assembled
more vis-à-vis independent PHUs.

To observe the material
features and behavior toward polarized
light at different temperatures, PLM on samples of all PHUs were studied
(magnification: 40×). Irrespective of the composition, all exhibited
a melting feature at 80–100 °C (Figure 7). With increase in temperature, a kind of
melting phenomenon occurred and folded chains were diffused to some
extent. It is interesting that the folded chain structure is slightly
diffused only under polarized light (no complete melting), which implies
the restricted flow of the hybrid PHUs. It is to be perceived that
the morphology is maintained at softening temperature also as evidenced
in PLM studies. In the cooling of PHU, the folded morphology was regained.
To understand the evolution of ordering in PHUs, BACY 55 was heated
to 100 °C and allowed to cool to 30 °C slowly and the images
were captured in the dark field. Interestingly, we could see the formation
of ribbonlike structures. This is nothing but folded surfaces due
to multiple H-bonding interactions in PHUs. These ribbonlike structures
will assemble to form a weblike structure, as observed from PLM images
(Figure 7). The folded
chains are clearly visible in FESEM images also.

Figure 7 (a) PLM images of BACY
55 with progressive heating where the structure
is diffused at elevated temperature. On cooling, the structure is
regained, which implies the reversible nature of hybrid PHUs (b) inset:
evolution of self-assembled superstructures in BACY 55 during the cooling
process.

In the next step, the application
potentials of the synthesized
homo and hybrid PHUs were explored by evaluation of adhesive strength.
Two different substrates were taken for the determination of lap shear
strength, viz., Al–Al (high-surface-energy polar substrates)
and HDPE–HDPE (low-surface-energy nonpolar substrates). The
aromatic homo PHU BACY 10 achieved an adhesive strength of 9 MPa,
whereas that of homo PHU BACY 01 recorded a lower value of 6 MPa.
By increasing the aromatic content, the adhesive strength reduced
to 5.0–7.5 MPa in the case of Al–Al substrates. When
the substrates are HDPE, the adhesive strengths of both homo PHUs
are about 1 MPa. Surprisingly, the adhesion was improved and doubled
to 2 MPa in PHU hybrids. This is attributed to the balanced behavior
of hybrid PHUs with polar and nonpolar counterparts. Hence, the hybrid
methodology adopted in this work is able to provide reasonable adhesion
between nonpolar substrates. Since hybrid PHUs exhibit restricted
flow at elevated temperature, they were tested for thermoreversible
adhesion. To prove the efficiency of the material for repeated use
(thermoreversible adhesion), the bonded substrates were heated to
100 °C and kept at this temperature for 0.5 h to allow the breaking
of noncovalent interactions. Then, the substrates were debonded manually.
The PHU-containing substrates were bonded again at 100 °C and
cooled to 30 °C. These coupons were tested for adhesive strength
evaluation, and it was found that there is no considerable degradation
in the adhesive strength in the case of both Al–Al and HDPE–HDPE
substrates (Figure 8). These results demonstrate that the noncovalent interactions can
lead to the reversal of adhesive property and the hybrid PHUs reported
in this work are reworkable by heating.

Figure 8 Lap shear strength of
PHUs on Al–Al and HDPE–HDPE
substrates. The PHUs are thermoreversible, and adhesion properties
are close to the original strength.

The hybrid nature of PHU gives good adhesive strength on both polar
and nonpolar substrates. The polar nature of aromatic-based PHU (BACY
10) and alicyclic-based PHU was tested by contact angle measurement.
BACY 10 (aromatic PHU) and BACY 01 (alicyclic nonpolar) exhibited
contact angles of 65 and 80°, respectively. This clearly substantiates
that BACY 10 is polar in nature and BACY 01 is nonpolar in nature.
By combining these chemical structures, the hybrid PHUs are able to
adhere to both polar and nonpolar substrates effectively, as the hybrid
structure comprises both aromatic and alicyclic PHU backbones.

To physically observe the weight-holding property of PHUs, a 1
kg weight was hung on the PHU-bonded Al coupons (after thermal bonding
and debonding) and the adhesive was found to be capable of withstanding
this weight for 24 h (Figure S8). Additionally,
the suitability of PHUs for pressure-sensitive adhesive applications
was investigated. Peel strength evaluation was conducted on polyimide–polyimide
film substrates, and the values are in the range of 1–1.5 kg/cm.
Meanwhile, BACY 55 could not be tested successfully due to failure
of polyimide substrate. It indicates that the peel strength of BACY
55 is higher than 1.5 kg/cm. Previously, trimethylolpropane triscarbonate
and poly(propylene oxide) biscarbonate hybrid system were polymerized
using an amine (EDR 148-PEA MW 148 g/mol), which resulted in a low
adhesive strength (LSS) of about 0.05 MPa between wood substrates.
In another study, same hybrid system was cured with 1,3-cyclohexanebis(methylamine)
as curing agent, which gave slightly increased adhesive strength of
0.10–0.15 MPa.53−56

The visible light transparencies of PHUs were evaluated by
solid-state
UV–visible spectroscopy. BACY 10 exhibited low transparency
compared to BACY 01 and hybrid PHUs. For example, transparency of
BACY 10 was only 30%, whereas all other PHUs are near to 70% at 400
nm. This infers that alicyclic moiety offers optical transparency
to hybrid PHUs (Figure S9). By hybridizing,
optical transparency of 70–80% was achieved in the 400–800
nm visible range. This is one of the useful attributes with other
features of PHUs described above. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA)
of the homo and hybrid networks were assessed by TGA under N2 atmosphere from 30 to 500 °C (Figure S10). All PHUs exhibited T5% in the 245–250
°C range (temperature at which 5% weight loss), which indicates
the decomposition of urethane bridge. It is the first decomposition
pattern typically observed for conventional polyurethanes. The hybrid
networks are resistant to moisture as noted by the absence of considerable
weight loss below 100 °C in TGA profiles due to multiple H-bonding,
which may not allow water molecules to attach easily.

3 Conclusions
In the present contribution, hybrid poly(hydroxy
urethane)s were
synthesized by mixed cyclic carbonate-amine polymerization. Aromatic-
and aliphatic-based cyclic carbonates were synthesized using epoxy-CO2 reaction under pressure. By increasing the aromatic content
in hybrid PHU, Tg enhanced to 18 °C,
which is attributed to multiple noncovalent interactions. Signature
peaks contributing to H-bonding (between −CO and OH/NH) were
tracked and identified by temperature-dependent FTIR. Participation
of −OH and NH groups in H-bonding with −CO was detailed
further by temperature-dependent NMR. The PHUs featured folded-sheet
morphology, and the folds became closer with equal concentration of
aromatic/aliphatic content in PHU. Growth of folded-sheet morphology
was very vivid in PLM images, which were traced by cooling down the
PHU. Since PHUs displayed restricted flow, they possessed excellent
thermoreversible adhesion with good bonding to both polar (Al–Al:
5–9 MPa) and nonpolar (HDPE–HDPE: 1.5–2.0 MPa)
substrates. PHUs are thermally stable up to 250 °C. Here, we
demonstrate a green synthetic route to obtain hybrid PHUs with thermoreversible
adhesion features.

4.2 Characterization Techniques
FTIR
spectra were recorded using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer in a
frequency range of 4000–500 cm–1. The sample
was mixed with KBr powder and pelletized. This pellet was used for
recording FTIR spectra. The NMR studies (1H NMR) were recorded
on a Bruker Avance spectrometer (300 MHz) with tetramethylsilane as
the internal standard. For variable-temperature experiment, the sample
solution prepared in CDCl3 was taken in the NMR tube. The
machine was programmed in such a way that NMR tube was heated from
300 to 370 K and back to 300 K. The samples were equilibrated at the
specified temperature for 5 min before acquisition. The acquisition
took 1 h for completion. Waters 600 GPC equipped with Waters 2414
refractive index detector was engaged for determining average molecular
weight and distribution. Tetrahydrofuran was used as eluent and the

a controlled strain of 0.01%. The surface morphological features of
hybrid PHU samples were examined using a Hitachi SU6600 scanning electron
microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 KV. Thin layer of PHUs
prepared in acetone was deposited over carbon tape, and gold coating
was given by sputtering using SCD 500 Sputter Coater (BAL-TEC AG,
Liechtenstein) prior to the analysis. Polarized light microscopy (PLM)
studies were conducted on Olympus BX51 microscope. A thin layer of
PHU was coated over a glass slide, and imaging was carried out at
a magnification of 40×. Static water contact angle of PHUs was
measured by sessile drop method in an automated goniometer (Data Physics
model OCA-20). Instron UTM 5569 Microtest model EM2/50/FR was employed
for the determination of adhesive strength (Lap Shear Strength) of
PHU samples. The selected substrates for the study were aluminum–aluminum
(Al–Al) and high-density polyethylene–high-density polyethylene
(HDPE–HDPE) (substrate dimension: 100 × 25 mm). Lap shear
strength was evaluated by ASTM D 1002 standard (crosshead speed of
50 mm/min was used for testing). The substrates to be bonded were
thoroughly etched with chromic acid and dried at 70–80 °C.
The dried substrates were used for bonding. The adhesive was mixed
with amine/catalyst, applied on the substrate, and the substrates
were bonded tightly by Teflon tape for 24 h. These bonded coupons
were used for LSS evaluation at 25–28 °C. Peel strength
of PHUs was tested according to ASTM D 1876. Polyimide films were
cut according to ASTM standard and bonded with the adhesive. The 90°
peel test was used for evaluating the peel strength. Instron UTM 5569
Microtest model EM2/50/FR was employed for the determination of peel
strength of the bonded film. A simultaneous DTA–TGA instrument
model SDT-2960 was used for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (heating
rate, 10 °C/min under N2).

4.3 Synthesis
of Cyclic Carbonates and Homo/Hybrid
PHUs
Prior to the synthesis of hybrid PHUs, aromatic (BACC)
and aliphatic (CYCC) cyclic carbonates were synthesized from their
respective epoxy functional monomers (Figure 2). Synthesis of aromatic-based cyclic carbonate
(BACC, starting monomer: diglycidyl ether bisphenol A) is given below.
The epoxy monomer was reacted with CO2 at 12 bar pressure
at a temperature of 100 °C (no solvent was used). The reaction
was performed in an autoclave made of stainless steel with a capacity
of 500 mL and that can withstand a maximum pressure of 100 bar. The
reactants were magnetically stirred and was connected with a pressure
gauge for monitoring the inside pressure. Here, 20 g of DGEBA was
used for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate. Benzyl triethyl ammonium
chloride (BTAC, 3% by weight) was used as phase-transfer catalyst.
When the pressure inside the autoclave (monitored with digital pressure
gauge) attained a constant pressure, reaction was stopped (ca. 16
h). The conversion to BACC was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S11), where the intense peak at 1798 cm–1 was noted, which is ascribed to the peak corresponding
to −CO of cyclic carbonate monomer. The epoxy content of BACC
was almost equal to 0 eq/kg, which underlined the complete conversion
of epoxy to cyclic carbonate group. Aliphatic cyclic carbonate (CYCC)
was synthesized employing the same strategy of CO2 insertion
into the epoxy ring (12 bar pressure at 100 °C for 16 h) in the
presence of BTAC as catalyst (no solvent was used). The conversion
was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S12). The presence of CC ring at 1798 cm–1 and the
absence of peak of epoxy group in the resultant product indicate the
insertion of CO2. Further, epoxy content of CYCC was ∼0
g/equivalent KOH, which implies the complete conversion of epoxy ring
to cyclic carbonate.

Initially, homo PHUs were synthesized.
BACC was reacted with PEA-400 by applying a progressive heating profile
(100 °C/2 h and 150 °C/2 h) to obtain homo PHU (BACY 10).
Similarly, CYCC was polymerized with PEA-400, which gave homo PHU
(BACY 01). Hybrid poly(hydroxy urethane)s were synthesized by copolymerizing
BACC and CYCC monomers in different molar ratios with PEA-400. In
all polymerization attempts, an amidoamine (Aradur HY960) was used
as catalyst. In the hybrid synthesis, the monomers BACC, CYCC, and
PEA-400 were mixed by magnetic stirring for 1 h. Then, the mixture
was maintained at ambient temperature for 15–17 h. In the second
step, the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 2 h and finally at
150 °C for 2 h to complete the polymerization. The copolymerized
samples were subjected to FTIR and GPC studies.
