The
production of shape-controlled heterometallic nanoparticles
(NPs) consisting of Pt and nonprecious metal oxides is crucial to
demonstrate the composition–property relationship of NPs. Herein,
we report a facile one-pot approach for the controlled synthesis of
dumbbell-like Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx and dendritic Pt–MnOx NPs. The key to the success of this synthesis is in changing
the quantity of Fe(CO)5 additive to control the reaction
kinetics. In the absence of Fe(CO)5, dendritic Pt–MnOx NPs were synthesized through the assembly of
small seed NPs. On the other hand, dumbbell-like Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs
were obtained in the presence of Fe(CO)5 through controlling
the nucleation and growth of Fe and Mn on the Pt NPs, followed by
air oxidation. Compared to a Pt/graphene oxide (GO) catalyst, dumbbell-like
Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs on GO showed an enhancement of specific activity toward
the oxygen reduction reaction owing to the compressive-strain effect
exerted on the Pt lattice.

Introduction
Integrating multiple
functionalities into a single nanoparticle
(NP) is an important strategy to design hybrid materials for advanced
applications. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the synthesis
of heterodimeric metal–metal oxide NPs comprising nonprecious
metal oxides owing to their unique magnetic,1 optical,2 and catalytic3−6 properties. The material properties of these NPs change at the heterojunction
between a metal and metal oxide,7 resulting
in surface reconstruction around the junction8 and electron transfer across the interface.9−14 For example, the nanoscale contact between PdPt NPs and an iron
oxide surface makes PdPt highly active for the detection of H2O2.15 Schaak and co-workers
reported hybrid Au–In2O3 NPs exhibiting
dual plasmonic resonance.16 Mechanistic
insights were also obtained to control the three-component hybrid
NP morphology.17 Therefore, it is crucial
to understand the interfacial interactions at the nanoscale level
for designing advanced composite nanomaterials.

To control the
morphology of heterodimeric metal–metal oxide
NPs, it is necessary to understand kinetic control in the solution
state. Generally, external additives such as halides, metal ions,
and metal salts have been proved to be efficient directors to influence
the growth rate of specific facets to achieve metal NPs with desirable
morphologies.18−20 However, the design and synthesis of heterodimeric
metal–metal oxide hybrid NPs containing three metal elements
still remain highly challenging due to the difficulties in controlling
the nucleation/growth kinetics of NPs from the reduction of multiple
metal precursors with different reduction potentials. Thus, our ongoing
interest in heterodimeric metal–metal oxide NPs motivated us
to investigate Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx nanocomposites.

In this article, we report
a facile one-pot synthesis of dendritic
Pt–MnOx and heterodimeric Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs.
The presence of iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO)5] as additive
plays a key role in inducing the formation of heterodimeric Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx structures
by altering the growth kinetics, thus inducing the formation of heterodimeric
Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx (Scheme 1). Electrochemical studies showed that Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/graphene oxide (GO)
catalyzed the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution with a specific activity higher than that
of the Pt/GO catalyst.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme of Pt–MnOx and
Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx Nanostructures
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Pt–MnOx and Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs obtained with or without Fe(CO)5. In the absence of Fe(CO)5, uniform Pt–MnOx dendritic structures built up by tens of primary
NPs with an average diameter of 2.1 ± 0.4 nm were obtained (Figure 1a,b). It is evident
that these small seed NPs assembled with one another to form larger
secondary three-dimensional dendritic architectures with recognizable
boundaries between the component subunits. Interestingly, the morphology
changed from dendritic to heterodimeric when a certain amount of Fe(CO)5 was introduced (Figure S1). Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs
were obtained by controlled nucleation and growth of Pt on Fe3O4–MnOx NPs.
By increasing the Fe(CO)5 amount from 15 to 45 μL,
and maintaining the other conditions as before, we found that the
shape of Fe3O4–MnOx changed from irregular to cubic and the average diameter
of each NP increased from 13 to 20 nm (Figure S1). To reduce the amount of Pt NPs that did not react with
Fe3O4–MnOx, the quantity of the Pt(acac)2 precursor was decreased
to 83 μmol, resulting in spherical-concave cubes (Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx) (Figure 1c,d). However, the
uniformity of the heterodimers drastically decreased when 42 μL
of Pt(acac)2 was used (Figure S2). These results indicate that the composition of the final products
could be readily manipulated, shifting from dendritic to heterodimeric
structures, with the introduction of different amounts of Fe(CO)5. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized by
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), as shown in Figure 2a. It can be seen that the Pt–MnOx diffraction peaks are characteristic of the
face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of Pt (ICSD #76414), and the weak
intensity is related to the spinel MnOx structure (ICSD #68174). In the case of Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx, only the crystallinity
of Pt and Fe3O4 was evident. This is probably
due to the fact that high solution temperatures (>200 °C)
and
hydrothermal conditions are generally required for highly crystalline
MnOx syntheses.21 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images
shown in Figure 2b,c
also demonstrate the formation of highly crystalline fcc Pt(111) and
cubic spinel Fe3O4(311) planes with lattice
fringe distances of 0.225 and 0.253 nm, respectively. The high-angle
annular dark-field scanning TEM high-angle annular dark-field imaging
(HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and
elemental mappings illustrate the Pt–MnOx (Figure 3a) and Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx heterodimer (Figures 3b and S3) structures. It
can be seen that Pt and MnOx are dispersed
in all areas of the Pt–MnOx dendrites,
confirming the hybrid Pt–MnOx structure.
In the case of Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx, the epitaxial relationship between Pt and
Fe3O4–MnOx in the composite NPs was confirmed by the small mismatch of the
lattice fringe between the two components.

The elemental analysis of Pt–MnOx/GO and Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO was confirmed by using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy
(XPS) (Figure 4). For
both samples, the Mn 2p3/2 peak can be deconvoluted into
some oxide components, and the most intense peak at 641.4 eV can be
assigned to Mn3O4 (Figure 4a,d).22 The binding
energies of the doublets for Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2, shown in Figure 4b,e, are characteristic of metallic and slightly oxidized Pt.23,24 The proportion of fully reduced Pt was higher in Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO (69%)
than in Pt/GO (60%) (Figure S4), resulting
in an electron-rich phase on the Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx surface (Table S1). The charge could be transferred from Fe3O4–MnOx to Pt at the
interface because the work function of Pt is higher than that of Fe3O4 and MnOx, which
can be explained in terms of the Schottky theory.25 Furthermore, the binding energy of the C–C bonds
(Pt–MnOx/GO) is assigned at 284.5
eV, and shifts of +1.6 and +3.6 eV are typically assigned to the C–O
and C=O functional groups, respectively (Figure 4c).26Figure 4f shows the Fe 2p
regions of Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO, indicating that both Fe2+ and
Fe3+ are present in Fe3O4. An additional
satellite peak (720 eV) appears between the Fe 2p1/2 (724.5
eV) and Fe 2p3/2 (710.6 eV) components, which is characteristic
of Fe3+ in γ-Fe2O3 and suggests
that the Fe3O4 NPs are partly oxidized.27

and Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO (d–f). The red lines and dots are peak sum and
raw data of samples, respectively.

The growth of heterodimeric nanocrystals was further analyzed
by
obtaining temporal images to understand the detailed mechanism. Irregular
spherical Fe3O4–MnOx seed NPs were obtained at 200 °C before the injection
of the Pt(acac)2 precursor solution (Figure 5a). The Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx heterodimer structure started
to form after the injection of Pt(acac)2 within 30 min
(Figure 5b). However,
the well-defined facets of the concave cube (Fe3O4–MnOx) appeared only in the later
stage (3 h) of the reaction to give the final heterodimeric structures
(Figure 1c).

the injection of Pt(acac)2 (a) and 30 min later after injection
of Pt(acac)2 (b).

To verify the effects of the reaction kinetics on the synthesis
of Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs, a set of control experiments were conducted. Because
the reducing power can be controlled by using a reducing agent [oleylamine
(OAm)], different amounts of OAm were introduced into the solution
to adjust the reduction kinetics. When the initial addition of OAm
was increased to 3 mL, heterodimeric nanostructures consisting of
Fe3O4–MnOx components with a decreased size were produced, revealing the formation
of a huge number of Pt nuclei (Figure S5a). On the other hand, the size of the Fe3O4–MnOx components increased due
to the low reduction kinetics, whereas the Pt NPs remained unreacted
when 0.5 mL of OAm was initially added (Figure S5b). The combination of stabilizing agents possessing different
binding strengths such as acids and amines was also crucial for the
morphology control. In the absence of oleic acid (OA), no heterodimeric
structures could be obtained, indicating that oleic acid played a
key role in the production of heterodimeric Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx nanostructures
(Figure S6a). When a sufficient amount
of oleic acid in the reaction mixture could react with all of the
Fe(CO)5, all iron in solution existed as iron oleate, leading
to a decomposition to produce the Fe3O4 heterodimeric
domains.28 Interestingly, when the OA was
replaced with an equal amount of moles of adamantane acetic acid,
keeping all other reaction conditions unchanged, we were able to obtain
small size di- or trimeric NPs, because it was not able to bind the
surface atoms due to a steric hindrance effect (Figure S6b). Figure S7 also shows
the irregular shape of the small size di- or trimeric NPs obtained
at 160 °C, demonstrating that both the stabilizing agents and
reaction temperature are critical to obtain well-defined heterodimeric
nanocrystals. The reducing/binding effects of carbon monoxide (CO)
in the synthetic process were confirmed (Figure S8). When an excess amount of CO gas was injected into the
reaction mixture instead of Fe(CO)5, only small particles
were synthesized, demonstrating that the CO molecules function as
a reducing agent as well as a capping ligand.

The ORR activity
was investigated by using thin-film rotating disk
electrode measurements. Figures S9 and 6 show the cyclic voltammograms and ORR polarization
curves for Pt/GO, Pt–MnOx/GO, and
Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO. As illustrated in Figure 6a, Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO exhibited the highest onset potential in
comparison to those of Pt/GO and Pt–MnOx/GO. In the kinetics- and diffusion-controlled regions,
a significant Ohmic loss was observed for Pt–MnOx/GO due to its dendritic structure with a surface
exposing MnOx that slightly blocked the
active surface of Pt, providing a lower ORR activity. Figure 6b shows the Koutecky–Levich
plot for the ORR, featuring the inverse current density (J–1) as a function of the inverse square root of
the rotating rate (ω–1/2) and demonstrating
first-order kinetics with respect to molecular oxygen.29 A four-electron transfer reaction was proved
by an n value of about 4 (3.76 and 3.68 for Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO and
Pt/GO, respectively), indicating an almost four-electron transfer
process toward the ORR.

The Nørskov group suggested
that the adsorption strength between
adsorbate and adsorbent is critical to minimize the overpotential
in the ORR.30 The metal–adsorbate
bond strength changes as a result of the d-band center shifts owing
to the strain variation (tensile or compressive) in the metal structure.31 For instance, under a compressive strain, the
overlap of the d-band increases and broadens, resulting in the downshifting
of the d-band center. Finally, the adsorption strength of the oxygen
species increases, pulling the antibonding states further below the
Fermi level and increasing the Pauli repulsion.32 This gives rise to weaker bonding with the oxygen adsorbate,
resulting in an increase in ORR activity. As shown in Figure 7, the employment of Fe3O4–MnOx resulted
in a decrease in the Pt–Pt bond length because of the induced
compressive strain in the Pt lattice, therefore, the d-band of Pt
was downshifted, finally leading to a weakened absorption strength.
Thus, the superior specific activity of Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO is attributable
to the compressive-strain effect exerted on the Pt lattice.

Conclusions
We have developed a
facile synthesis of dumbbell-like Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs
through the controlled thermal decomposition of Fe(CO)5 and the reduction of metal precursors. Fe(CO)5 additives
were confirmed to be crucial for the shape control. The morphology
of the final products could be readily manipulated, shifting from
dendritic to heterodimeric structures, with the introduction of different
amounts of Fe(CO)5. The effects of the reaction kinetics
on the synthesis of Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs were established by varying the experimental
conditions, which included the control of reducing and stabilizing
agents. Among the synthesized catalysts, the Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO catalyst
showed the highest specific activity toward the ORR owing to the compressive-strain
effect exerted on the Pt lattice. A similar concept may be applicable
to other multimetallic NP systems for electrocatalytic applications.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Dendritic Pt–MnOx and Heterodimeric Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs
To synthesize heterodimeric Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx NPs,
0.129 g of Mn(acac)2 was mixed with 10 mL of 1-octadecene
(ODE), 1 mL of OA, and 1 mL of OAm. After being placed under vacuum
at 100 °C for 1 h, the formed solution was slowly heated from
60 to 120 °C in 10 min. After 30 min of heating at 120 °C,
under an air atmosphere, a small amount (0.1 mL) of Fe(CO)5 solution [prepared by mixing (0.15–0.45 mL) of Fe(CO)5 with 1 mL of ODE] was added to this solution. The temperature
was raised to 200 °C (4 °C/min) and kept at this temperature
for 30 min. Then, Pt(acac)2 solution [Pt(acac)2 with ODE (4 mL) and OAm (1 mL) solution] was added, and the mixture
was kept at this temperature for 3 h. The solution was cooled down
to room temperature. The product was separated by centrifugation with
ethanol and hexane. The product was then dispersed in hexane.

Dendritic Pt–MnOx NPs were also
synthesized similarly. Mn(acac)2 (0.129 g) was mixed with
10 mL of ODE, 1 mL of OA, and 1 mL of OAm. After being placed under
vacuum at 100 °C for 1 h, the formed solution was slowly heated
from 60 to 120 °C in 10 min. After 30 min of heating at 120 °C
under an air atmosphere, the temperature was raised to 200 °C
(4 °C/min) and kept at this temperature for 30 min. Then, Pt(acac)2 solution [Pt(acac)2 with ODE (4 mL) and OAm (1
mL) solution] was added, and the mixture was kept at this temperature
for 3 h. The solution was cooled down to room temperature. The product
was separated by centrifugation with ethanol and hexane. The product
was then dispersed in hexane.

Synthesis of GO Nanosheets
GO was synthesized from
graphite powder according to the modified Hummer’s method.33 The graphite powder (1 g) was added to 46 mL
of cold H2SO4 (0 °C), then KMnO4 (6 g) was gradually added under continuous stirring in an ice bath.
After 15 min, NaNO3 (1 g) was introduced into the mixture.
The solution was further stirred at 35 °C for 1 h and deionized
(DI)-H2O (80 mL) was added. After being stirred for 15
min, the reaction was terminated by addition of DI-H2O
(200 mL) and 10 mL of 30% H2O2. The product
was washed with HCl (1:10) and then with water, and then suspended
in distilled water. The brown dispersion was extensively dialyzed
to remove residual metal ions and acids. After the unexploited graphite
in the resulting mixture was removed by centrifugation, as-synthesized
GO was dispersed into individual sheets in distilled water at a concentration
of 0.47 mg/mL with the help of sonication.

Synthesis of Pt–MnOx/GO and
Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO Nanocomposites
Product solution dispersed in
20 mL of hexane was added into 20 mL of a dimethylformamide solution
of graphene oxide (2.5 mg/mL), and the mixture was sonicated for 1
h. After washing, the powder was then suspended in 40 mL of acetic
acid, and the suspension was heated at 70 °C overnight to remove
the surfactants around the nanoparticles. The product was then centrifugated
(8000 rpm 10 min) and washed with ethanol two times before it was
dried.

Electrochemical Measurements
All electrochemical tests
were conducted at room temperature and ambient pressure. Well-dispersed
samples were deposited on a 5 mm in diameter glassy carbon electrode
that was used as the working electrode. A platinum wire and a Ag/AgCl
electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
HClO4 (0.1 M) at pH 1.0 was used as an electrolyte. The
samples were mixed with 89.6 mL of distilled water, 10 mL of isopropanol,
and 0.4 mL of Nafion solution. The 30 μL of ink was dropped
onto the working electrode (40 μgmetal/cm2) surface to enhance the bond on the electrode surface.

Characterization
The morphology of each sample was
characterized by TEM (FEI TALOS F200X operated at 200 kV, Pusan National
University) by placing a few drops of the corresponding colloidal
solution on carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh, F/C coated, Ted
Pella Inc., Redding, CA). The XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku
D/MAX-RB (12 kW) diffractometer. XPS (Theta Probe, Thermo) was employed
to measure the structural and chemical properties of the nanocomposites.
A three-electrode electrochemical cell with a potentiostat (Biologic
VSP) was used to evaluate the Pt–Fe3O4–MnOx/GO and Pt/GO samples.
