The
mineral formation–transition mechanism, microstructure
evolution, crystal structure, pulverization property, and chemical
reactivity of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with MgO and Na2SO4 dopants
during the sintering process at 1300 °C for 2.0 h were systematically
studied using CaO, Al2O3, SiO2, MgO,
and Na2SO4 as raw materials when the molar ratio
of CaO to Al2O3 is 1.4, the mass ratio of Al2O3 to SiO2 is 3.0, and the mass percentage
of MgO and Na2SO4 is 2%. The MgO dopant could
result in 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2, transform into 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, restrain the crystal transformation of 2CaO·SiO2 from β to γ, and then deteriorate the pulverization
and alumina leaching property corresponding to parts of Al, Si, and
Mg atoms occupying the same lattice positions of the crystal structure.
MgO and Na2SO4 codoped could promote transformation
of 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 into 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 as well as some 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, while 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 has good alumina leaching property in the Na2CO3–NaOH solution. The ultrasonic assistant mainly could
promote the diffusion of reactive samples, enhance the separation
of agglomeration, and then accelerate the chemical reaction of the
sintered clinker with Na2CO3–NaOH.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Calcium aluminate-based
materials have become popular composites
for scientific technological progress, which have wide applications
in concrete (low density and hardness),1,2 biomaterials
(physical, mechanical, bioactive, and biocompatible),3 functional ceramic, and refractory (high-temperature stability).
Meanwhile, they also play an important role in the metallurgical industry
recovering alumina from low-grade aluminum-containing resources with
the lime sinter process,4,5 such as high-iron bauxite,
Bayer red mud, kaolinite, and high-alumina fly ash. Obviously, they
show incomparable advantages of dry sintering, self-pulverization,
and being environmentally friendly and free from secondary pollution
as compared with the soda sinter process, acid process, and acid-soda
combined process.

CaO·2Al2O3, CaO·Al2O3, and 12CaO·7Al2O3 have good chemical
reactivity in the Na2CO3–NaOH leaching
process,5−7 while the β → γ crystal transformation
of 2CaO·SiO2 is responsible for the pulverization
process. Based on the crystal structure, CaO·Al2O3 contains double sheets of edge-sharing AlO6 octahedra
or two crystallography-independent AlO6 octahedra forming
edge-sharing double chains.8,9 12CaO·7Al2O3 contains vertex-shared AlO4 tetrahedra with
some of the corners linked by bridging Ca atoms, in which O atoms
are trapped in the Ca–Al–O cage.10−12 In the mineral
transition and physical–chemical property, previous literature
shows that the MgO dopant would deteriorate the chemical reactivity
and pulverization property of the CaO–Al2O3 clinker sharply,13 but the effect mechanism
has not been reported distinctly and systematically, especially on
the mineral formation–transition process and crystal structure
evolution. Actually, the negative effect of MgO is difficult to eliminate
completely. Because the raw materials such as alumina-containing resources
and lime usually contain trace amounts of MgO; it also could reduce
the solubility of sulfur-containing compounds in calcium silicate,
therefore compensating for the negative effects of SO3.14 MgO seems to favor exsolution of the sulfate
to form 2CaO·SiO2, and the inhibition of conversion
from 2CaO·SiO2 to 3CaO·SiO2 is more
readily overcome.15 SO3 could
promote the formation of 2CaO·SiO2 rims, while MgO
could enhance 3CaO·SiO2 in the SO3-bearing
clinker.16 Furthermore, the diffusion of
the elements Na, Mg, Si, S, V, and Fe into the calcium aluminate and
silicate compounds also has been observed, which mainly leads to the
formation of spinels, vanadate sulfates, and silicates.17 Moreover, calcium sulfo-aluminate phases can
partially accommodate metals (Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Fe) in the crystal
lattice, giving rise to chemical entrapment. It is also observed that
calcium sulfo-aluminate (3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4) would decompose into CaO·Al2O3, CaO, and SO3 when the sintering temperature exceeds
1300 °C.18

The aim of this paper
is to study the “structure–activity”
relationship of the crystal structure characteristics and mineral
formation–transition mechanism with the physicochemical property
(self-pulverization property and chemical reactivity in the Na2CO3–NaOH solution) in the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 system with the MgO and
Na2SO4 dopant. The influence mechanism of MgO
on the mineral transition process and chemical reactivity will be
studied comprehensively, while the eliminate mechanism of Na2SO4 on the MgO negative interaction will also be reported.
Then, it would be a breakthrough application and development in the
lime sinter process recovering alumina and other valuable elements
from low-grade alumina-containing resources.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Sintered
Clinker with
MgO–Na2SO4 Dopant
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with MgO and Na2SO4 dopants are shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the main minerals of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker without MgO and Na2SO4 dopants are 12CaO·7Al2O3 [cubic system, I̅43d (220)] and γ-2CaO·SiO2 [orthorhombic system, Pbnm(62)] as well as some CaO·Al2O3 [monoclinic system, P21/n(14)]. The 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 content of the sintered clinker with the MgO dopant decreases.
So, MgO dopant could promote the process 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 react with MgO
transform into 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 (orthorhombic system, Pmmn(59), a = 27.15 Å b = 10.63 Å c = 5.09 Å), and it also could restrain the crystal
transformation of 2CaO·SiO2 from β to γ
during the cooling process. The mineral compositions of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with the MgO
dopant are 12CaO·7Al2O3, γ-2CaO·SiO2, β-2CaO·SiO2 [monoclinic, P21/n (14)] and 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2. Through the analysis,
we can realize that the Na2SO4 dopant could
restrain the formation of 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, and the main minerals are 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 as well
as some 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2 [tetragonal system, P̅421m(113)] and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 [orthorhombic system, Pcc2(27), a = 12.97 Å b = 13.03 Å c = 9.16 Å]. The preferred indices of the crystal face are (1̅
2 3) in CaO·Al2O3, (4 0 0) in 12CaO·7Al2O3, (1 3 0) in γ-2CaO·SiO2, (2 1 1) in 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, (0 4 2) in 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4, and (8 2 0) in 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, which are calculated according to the XRD data.

The Visualizer module of Materials
Studio is used to establish
the three-dimensional models of 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4. The unit cell models data, corresponding
to the space group, lattice parameters, and atom distribution position,
are calculated according to the XRD results (Figure 1). 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 belongs to the orthorhombic crystal
system, Pmmn(59) space group, and lattice parameters
are as follows: a = 27.15 Å, b = 10.63 Å, c = 5.09 Å, and α =
β = γ = 90°. 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 belongs to the orthorhombic crystal system, Pcc2(27) space group, and lattice parameters are as follows: a = 12.97 Å, b = 13.03 Å, c = 9.16 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°.
The atom distribution position corresponds to the ICSD data, which
is shown in Tables 1 and 2. In addition, the unit cell models
could provide the foundational models for the subsequent calculation
and explanation, which are shown in Figure 2.

According to Figure 2a and Table 1, the
unit cell of 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 has four lattice position Ca atoms (Ca1, Ca2, Ca3, and Ca4), six lattice position
Al atoms (Al1, Al2, Al3, Al4, Al5, and Al6), two lattice position Mg (Mg1 and Mg2) and Si (Si1 and Si2) atoms, and 13 lattice position O atoms (On, n = 1, 2, 3...13). Further analysis show
that O atoms distribute uniformly in the unit cell, while Ca, Mg,
Al, and Si atoms distribute unevenly. It also shows that two forms
of Al atoms and Mg atoms occupy the same lattice positions (x, y, z) in (0.9543, 0.8989,
0.1256) and (0.0161, 0.2500, 0.3719), while two forms of Al atoms
and Si atoms also occupy the same lattice position in (0.2500, 0.8929,
0.8434) and (0.1943, 0.2500, 0.7376). The overlapping Al–Si
atoms are in the corner of the tetrahedron by the composition of Al,
Si, and O atoms. The overlapping Al–Mg atoms are in the middle
of the O–Mg (Al)–O bond. It mainly attributes to the
atom substitution process in the formation of 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2. According to Figure 2b and Table 2, the unit cell of 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 has four lattice position
Ca atoms (Ca1, Ca2, Ca3, and Ca4), eight lattice position Al atoms (Aln, n = 1, 2, 3...8), one lattice position Si
atom, and 16 lattice position O atoms (On, n = 1, 2, 3...16). All atoms have no overlapping
distribution. All O atoms distribute uniformly in the unit cell, while
Ca, Al, and S atoms distribute unevenly. S atom distributes in the
center of the O tetrahedron.

The microstructure of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with MgO and
Na2SO4 dopants are shown in Figure 3a–c. The selected characteristic
regions are
also confirmed by the energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis,
as also shown in Figure 3d.

Figure 3 Microstructure and EDS analysis of the sintered clinker: CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker (a), CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 with the 2% MgO clinker
(b), CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 with the 2% MgO–2% Na2SO4 clinker (c),
and chemical composition of the sintered clinker in the magnified
characteristic region (d).

As shown in Figure 3a, the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker without MgO and Na2SO4 dopants shows
an irregular morphology with a wrinkled surface. According to the
XRD results (Figure 1) and EDS analysis (Figure 3d), the selected region (A) in Figure 3a may correspond to the coexisting phases
of 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2. The CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with the MgO dopant (Figure 3b) shows a regular and porous morphology,
and the magnified characteristic region (B) also shows a porous morphology,
corresponding to the agglomeration of well-organized and cuboid molecules,
which mainly attributes to 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2. Further, Figure 3c shows that the regular morphology (in Figure 3b) turns into a dense
porous-layered morphology when Na2SO4 is added.
The sintered clinker melts completely in the sintering process with
amounts of pores, mainly because of Na2SO4 decomposition.
It not only could decrease the melting point of the sintered materials
but also could generate 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 with low melting point. The magnified characteristic region
(C) in Figure 3c mainly
corresponds to the coexisting phases of 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 as well as some
3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4, which
is in accordance with the XRD results (Figure 1) and EDS analysis (Figure 3d).

Figure 4 shows the
particle size distribution of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with MgO and Na2SO4 dopants, and its particle size parameters are also shown
in Table 3. The CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker without MgO and
Na2SO4 dopants shows a bimodal distribution
with the size ranging from 0.35 to 575.85 μm, and the two peaks
are centered at 0.75 and 50.78 μm. The D50 and specific surface area are 33.26 μm and 0.86 m2·g–1, respectively. According to the
XRD results (Figure 1), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (Figure 3) and particle size distribution
(Figure 4), the MgO
dopant in the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker could not only consume part of 2CaO·SiO2, 12CaO·7Al2O3, and CaO·Al2O3 to form 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 but also restrain the transformation
process of 2CaO·SiO2 from β to γ. Because
2CaO·SiO2 is comprised of several polymorphs, such
as α, αL′, αH′, αm′, β, and γ, the polycrystalline type transformation
from β to γ is responsible for the pulverization process
at 12 vol % expansion.19 Therefore, the
decrease of the 2CaO·SiO2 content and the inhibition
of the transformation process from β-2CaO·SiO2 to γ-2CaO·SiO2 are the main reasons that the
MgO dopant could deteriorate the pulverization property obviously.
The CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker
with the MgO dopant also shows a bimodal distribution with the size
ranging from 0.85 to 768.55 μm. The two peaks are centered at
0.75 and 60.05 μm. The D50 increases,
while the specific surface area decreases slightly, which are 5.84
μm and 0.68 m2·g–1, respectively.
It is in accordance with microstructural characteristics obtained
by the SEM analysis (Figure 3) that the sintered clinker agglomerate easily with amounts
of small particles in the surface of the major structure. MgO and
Na2SO4 codopants could not only restrain the
formation of 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 but also result in the formation of 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2 and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4. According to the XRD results (Figure 1) and SEM analysis
(Figure 3), the low
melting phase 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2 and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 formation is the major reason that the pulverization property of
the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker
with MgO and Na2SO4 codopants deteriorates significantly.
The particle size of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with 2% MgO–2% Na2SO4 shows a trimodal distribution with the size ranging from 0.35 to
1000 μm, and the three peaks are centered on 0.71, 63.25, and
502.38 μm, respectively. The D50 and specific surface area are 56.71 μm and 0.50 m2·g–1.

The alumina leaching property of
the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker
with the MgO–Na2SO4 dopant, and the XRD
patterns of leached residue
from the sintered clinker are shown in Figures 5 and 6.

Figure 5 Alumina leaching
property of the sintered clinker in the Na2CO3–NaOH solution.

Figure 6 XRD patterns of the leached
residue from the sintered clinker.

As shown in Figure 5, the alumina leaching property of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker without the MgO–Na2SO4 dopant is 95.74%. The MgO dopant could deteriorate
the alumina leaching property, which decreases circa 10%. Even then,
the Na2SO4 dopant could increase the alumina
leaching property circa 8%, but it also could not remove the negative
effect absolutely of MgO in the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker. As shown in Figure 6, the main minerals of the leached residue
from the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker are CaCO3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 as well as some 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2. The mineral compositions of the leached residue from the
CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker
with the MgO dopant are CaCO3, γ-2CaO·SiO2, 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, and Na6(AlSiO4)6·4H2O [orthorhombic, Pbn21(33)]. The main minerals
of the leached residue from the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with the MgO–Na2SO4 dopant are CaCO3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 as well as some 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, Na6(AlSiO4)6·4H2O, and MgO.

According to Figures 1 and 6, the mineral
compositions of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker without MgO and
Na2SO4 dopants are 12CaO·7Al2O3, CaO·Al2O3, γ-2CaO·SiO2, and 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2. The mineral compositions of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with the MgO dopant are 12CaO·7Al2O3, γ-2CaO·SiO2, 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, and 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2. The mineral
compositions of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with the MgO–Na2SO4 dopant
are 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2 as well as some 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, MgO, and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4. According to Figures 1, 5, and 6,
12CaO·7Al2O3, CaO·Al2O3, and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 also have good chemical reactivity in the Na2CO3–NaOH solution, while γ-2CaO·SiO2, 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, and
20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 have poor chemical reactivity that they maybe could not react with
Na2CO3–NaOH solution. The reaction equations
of 12CaO·7Al2O3, CaO·Al2O3, and 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 with Na2CO3–NaOH are shown in eqs 1–3. Furthermore, additional sodium hydrate could restrain the
hydrolytic process of NaAl(OH)4, as also shown in eq 4. 1   2   3   4  

2.2 Chemical
Activity Enhancement of Sintered
Clinker with Ultrasonic Assistant
The alumina leaching property
of the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with the MgO–Na2SO4 dopant
varying with the leaching temperature, leaching duration, leaching
solution system [Na2OK (in the form of NaOH)
= 10 g·L–1, Na2OC (in
the form of Na2CO3) = 80–130 g·L–1], and the ultrasonic assistant is shown in Figure 7a–c. The chemical
compositions and XRD patterns of the leached residue (the leaching
temperature is 80 °C, the leaching duration is 40 min, and the
leaching solutions are Na2OC = 130 g·L–1 and Na2OK = 10 g·L–1) from the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker with MgO and Na2SO4 dopants
are shown in Figures 7d and 8.

Figure 7 Alumina leaching property of the sintered
clinker with the ultrasonic
assistant: leaching temperature (a), sodium carbonate concentration
(b), leaching duration (c), and chemical composition of the leached
residue (d).

Figure 8 XRD patterns of the leached residue from the
sintered clinker with
the ultrasonic assistant.

As shown in Figure 7a–c, increasing leaching temperature from 50 to 70 °C
could reinforce the chemical reactivity of the sintered clinker in
the Na2CO3–NaOH solution significantly,
and the alumina leaching property increases circa 12%. The process
of the sintered clinker with Na2CO3–NaOH
solution has a fast reaction rate. Improving the sodium carbonate
concentration from 80 to 120 g·L–1 also has
an obvious effect on the alumina leaching property circa 9%. Increasing
leaching temperature higher than 70 °C, improving the sodium
carbonate concentration higher than 120 g·L–1, and prolonging leaching duration higher than 15 min also has no
obvious effect on the alumina leaching property. The ultrasonic assistant
could also improve the alumina leaching property, and the reinforcement
decreases gradually with the increase of leaching temperature and
sodium carbonate concentration. It has a remarkable reinforcement
circa 6%, especially when the leaching temperature is lower than 70
°C or the sodium carbonate content is less than 110 g·L–1. The reinforcement mechanism mainly attributes to
the chemical effect and heat effect, and then the ultrasonic assistant
could promote the diffusion process of the sintered clinker and accelerate
the chemical reaction.

As shown in Figure 8, the mineral compositions of the leached
residue without the ultrasonic
assistant are CaCO3 (calcite), γ-2CaO·SiO2, 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, Na6(AlSiO4)6·4H2O, and MgO. The main minerals of the leached residue with
the ultrasonic assistant have no obvious difference. A small amount
of CaCO3 (vaterite) generates and MgO disappears. The mineral
compositions are CaCO3 (calcite), CaCO3 (vaterite),
γ-2CaO·SiO2, 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2, Na6(AlSiO4)6·4H2O, and 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2.

Figure 9 shows the
Raman spectra of leaching (Na2CO3–NaOH)
and leached solution. According to the Raman spectra of leaching solution,
it shows a sharp peak and a wide peak. The band situated at 1067 cm–1 attributes to the C=0 bond stretching vibration
of CO32– in Na2CO3, while the band situated at 3056–3444 cm–1 attribute to the O–H bond stretching vibration in NaOH. In
addition to the existing two peaks of C=O and O–H bonds
in the leaching solution, two sharp peaks could be detected in the
leached solution. The band situated at 620 cm–1 attributes
to the Al–OH stretching vibration of NaAl(OH)4,
which mainly corresponds to the chemical reaction of 12CaO·7Al2O3, CaO·Al2O3 with Na2CO3 (eqs 1 and 2). The band situated at 775 cm–1 attributes to the stretching vibration of the Al–O–Si
bond in Na2O·A12O3·xSiO2·nH2O.
Silicon-containing γ-2CaO·SiO2 and 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 also have good
chemical stability in the Na2CO3–NaOH
solution, while β-2CaO·SiO2 have good chemical
reactivity with Na2CO3. Therefore, the Na2O·A12O3·xSiO2·nH2O (Na6[AlSiO4]6·4H2O) formation process
mainly corresponds to the secondary reaction of NaAl(OH)4 with Na2SiO3, which is shown in eq 5. The Na2SiO3 formation mainly corresponds to the chemical reaction of β-2CaO·SiO2 with Na2CO3, and the reaction equation
is shown in eq 6. The
intensity of Al–O–Si stretching vibration decreases
with the ultrasonic assistant when compared with the leached solution
without it. 5   6

leached residue (ultrasonic assistant)	12.36	28.20	59.35	0.22	
According to Figure 10a,d and Table 4, the sintered clinker (ball-milled) shows
a uniform particle size
distribution with the size ranging from 0.26 to 179.74 μm. The
bimodal peaks are centered at 0.76 and 40.15 μm, while the D50 and specific surface area are 36.38 μm
and 0.17 m2·g–1. According to Figure 10b,d and Table 4, the leached residue
from the CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 clinker without ultrasonic shows a complete irregular particle size
distribution with the size ranging from 0.23 to 200.05 μm. Most
parts of small particles agglomerate into larger particles, while
it has a rough surface. The D50 and specific
surface area are 39.14 μm and 0.16 m2·g–1, respectively. The leached residue with the ultrasonic
assistant shows a relative regular particle size distribution when
compared with the leached residue without ultrasonic. It also shifts
toward much smaller particle size, and the D50 and specific surface area are 28.20 μm and 0.22 m2·g–1, respectively.

3 Conclusions
The MgO dopant could result in 12CaO·7Al2O3 and γ-2CaO·SiO2, transform
into 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, restrain the
crystal transformation of 2CaO·SiO2 from β to
γ, and then deteriorate the pulverization and alumina leaching
property. The overlapping Al–Si atoms are in the corner of
the tetrahedron, and the Al–Mg atoms are in the middle of the
O–Mg(Al)–O bond in the 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2 crystal structure, which
attributes to the structure and physicochemical property evolution.
MgO and Na2SO4 co-doped could promote 20CaO·13Al2O3·3MgO·3SiO2, transform into
3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 as well
as some 2CaO·Al2O3·SiO2. 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 has
good chemical reactivity in the Na2CO3–NaOH
solution, and the Ca, Al, Si, and O have no overlapping distribution.
The ultrasonic assistant mainly could promote the diffusion of reactive
samples, enhance the separation of agglomeration, accelerate the chemical
reaction, and then optimize the alumina leaching property.

4 Experimental Section
The raw materials used in this
study are analytical reagent α-Al2O3,
CaCO3 (calcite), SiO2, MgO, and Na2SO4, and the chemical analysis
is shown in Table 5. The average particle size (D50) of
CaCO3, Al2O3, SiO2, and
MgO are 12.94, 43.47, 17.07, and 15.02 μm, while the specific
surface area are 0.71, 0.31, 0.83, and 0.93 m2·g–1, respectively. The hybrid materials of CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 with the oxide dopant
(MgO and Na2SO4) were prepared with the molar
ratio of CaO to Al2O3 being 1.4, the mass ratio
of Al2O3 to SiO2 being 3.0, the mass
percentage of MgO ranging from 0 to 2%, and the mass percentage of
Na2SO4 ranging from 0 to 2% [e.g., CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 (0% MgO–0% Na2SO4), CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 (2% MgO–0% Na2SO4), and CaO–Al2O3–SiO2 (2% MgO–2% Na2SO4)]. After the milled process, the homogeneous
materials were subjected in cold-isostatic pressing (30 MPa) to produce
a cylindrical sample with 10 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length using
polyvinylidene fluoride as the binder. Then, the samples were sintered
at 1300 °C for 2.0 h in the MoSi2 resistance furnace
(KLS-1700x) followed by cooling in the furnace. The temperature system
in the heating and cooling process is shown in Figure 11.

The sintered clinker varying with
the oxide dopant is leached at
80 °C for 0.5 h in sodium carbonate with sodium hydrate (Na2CO3–NaOH) solution in a three-necked flask.
The concentration of sodium carbonate (in the form of Na2OC) and sodium hydrate (in the form of Na2OK) in the solution is 80 and 10 g·L–1. The liquid–solid ratio of leaching solution to the sintered
clinker is 10. The alumina concentration (CAl2O3) in the filter liquor is analyzed by the
volumetric method, and the alumina leaching property is calculated
by eq 7. 7  where CAl2O3 is
the alumina concentration in the leached solution,
g·L–1; VAl2O3 is the leached solution volume, L; m is the reactive mass of the sintered clinker, g; wAl2O3 is the alumina mass percentage
of the sintered clinker.

The mineral compositions of the sintered
clinker and the leached
residue were determined by XRD (Rigaku D/MAX-2500). The microstructure
was carried out by SEM (Bruker TESCAN Vega3) fitted with an energy-dispersive
spectrometer (EDS, X-Flash 410M). The Raman absorption of leaching
and leached solution was obtained by the MultiRAM FT-Raman equipment.
The particle size distribution of the sintered clinker and leached
residue was determined by Malvern Mastersizer instrument laser scattering
equipment (Hydro 2000MU). The specific surface area of the sintered
clinker and leached residue was determined by surface area and the
pore porosimetry analyzer (V-Sorb 4800P).
