NK-2, derived from a cationic core region of NK-lysin, displays antimicrobial activity toward negatively
charged bacterial membranes. We have studied the interaction of NK-2
with various phospholipid membranes, using a variety of experimental
techniques, such as, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), ζ
potential, and dynamic light scattering. As bacteria mimicking membranes,
we have chosen large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of negatively
charged phospholipid and neutral phospholipids. ITC and ζ potential
results show the stronger binding affinity of NK-2 to negatively charged
membranes than to neutral membranes. Saturation of the isotherm, obtained
from ITC, at a given lipid to NK-2 ratio, was found to be consistent
with the charge compensation, determined from ζ potential. A
surface partition model with electrostatic contribution was used to
estimate the intrinsic binding constant and other thermodynamical
parameters of binding kinetics of NK-2. The size distribution of negatively
charged LUV in the presence of NK-2 was found to increase drastically,
indicating the presence of large aggregates. Such a large aggregate
has not been observed in neutral membranes, which supports the ITC
and ζ potential results.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs) are an innate immune response in
animal and human body against invading pathogens, such as viruses,
fungi, bacteria, etc.1,2 They target the bacterial membrane,
especially negatively charged surface, and create defects, such as
pores, leading to disruption of the membrane.3 An important property of AMP is the specificity of bacterial targets
and excludes the killing of most eukaryotic cells.4 The resistance to conventional antibiotics and the natural
cell lytic activity of many AMP and their unique mode of action have
led to a new possibility in the development of AMP as human therapeutics.5 Therefore, studies on the interaction of AMP
with lipid membranes have drawn a lot of attention due to their potential
biomedical applications.1,6−8 Diverse applications of AMP include as anti-infective agents, anticancer
agents, drug delivery and nonviral gene transfer.1,9 A
major problem that has impeded the development of drug design is the
toxicity. NK-2, an AMP, which is nontoxic and nonhemolytic to the
human skin cells, can be a potential candidate for designing antibiotics.10

NK-2 is a water soluble linear amphipathic
helical peptide.8 It is the highest density
region of NK-lysin
having cationic charge of +10 at physiological pH. The high positive
charges within the NK-2 promote strong binding to the negatively charged
membranes.11 The antimicrobial activity
of NK-2 toward parasitic membranes involves the interaction with lipids
in the membranes. A teleost NK-lysin peptide, NKLP27, is known to
induce degradation of bacterial DNA and inhibits bacterial and viral
infection.12 There have been a large number
of studies of many AMP, using a variety of experimental techniques,
such as optical microscopy,13−16 oriented circular dichroism,17 X-ray and neutron scattering,18 isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC),19 and differential
scanning calorimetry.20 However, very little
is known in the case of NK-2. NK-2 impels significant changes in cellular
morphology of human cancer cells and eventually cells lose their cellular
integrity until destruction.21 NK-2 intercalates
and binds to the negatively charged membranes, such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol
(DPPG) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS),
but does not interact with the phosphatidylcholine (PC) or sphingomyelin,
as revealed by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer21 and ζ potential.22 Conformational changes as well as the orientation of AMP play a
vital role in the formation of transmembrane pores.7,21 Previous
study of NK-2, dissolved in different aqueous solutions, has shown
mainly α-helical conformation in the presence of negatively
charged amphiphiles.8 Similar α-helical
confirmation in the membrane environment has also been found in other
AMP, such as melittin23 and Magainin 2.24 However, NK-2 adopts an unoriented random coil
structure in the buffer, including water and in the presence of cationic
and neutral amphiphiles below their critical micellar concentration.
The conformational transition from random coil to helix arises mainly
due to electrostatic interaction of positively charged residues of
the peptide with the negatively charged head group of amphiphiles.8 However, penetration of peptides into the hydrophobic
core is a result of hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic
chain of the amphiphiles and hydrophobic residues of the peptide.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of the outer membrane
of gram negative bacteria, shows strong binding affinity to NK-2,
as determined by various experimental techniques, such as small angle
X-ray diffraction, ζ potential, and isothermal titration calorimetry.10 It is believed that the main pathway to disrupt
the integrity of the cellular membrane is the formation of transmembrane
pores. Different AMPs seem to follow different pathways to create
transmembrane pores.25 Therefore, in spite
of a large number of attempts, the mechanism of transmembrane pore
formation is still under dispute.6,26 For example,
molecular electroporation was proposed as the mechanism of membrane
pore formation, induced by NK-lysin.27

Biological membranes are complex, regulated by various membrane
components. Therefore, it is often useful to study model membranes
to understand more complex lipid–peptide interactions and hence
to get some insight into the mechanism of cellular damage induced
by AMP. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), made from lipid molecules,
serve as an excellent model system to study many biological activities.28 For example, a kinetic process involving interaction
of melittin and other AMP with PC vesicles have previously been demonstrated
using the micropipette aspiration technique13 and leakage assay using fluorescence spectroscopy.14,16 It was found from previous studies of various AMP that the activity
of pore formation initiates above a threshold lipid to the peptide
ratio (∼70 for melittin).13,17 This threshold
seems to be different for different peptides.

There have not
been systematic studies on the interaction of NK-2
with phospholipid membranes. Therefore, there are several open questions
which have not been addressed in the literature. Does NK-2 make pores
on the membranes, as in the case of other AMPs? If NK-2 makes pores,
what is the mechanism that NK-2 uses to form transmembrane pores?
How does the size of pores depend on lipid composition and concentration
of NK-2? Although there was a previous study on the interaction of
NK-2 with LPS,11 the binding affinity of
NK-2 with negatively charged phospholipid is still not well understood.
It is also important to know how the binding affinity of NK-2 with
phospholpids depends on the head group charge and size of the head
group. It would also be interesting to observe any morphological change
induced by NK-2 in the model membrane.

The major constituents
of bacterial membranes are phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE) and phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG) (∼4:1).20 Therefore, in our present study, we have chosen model systems,
composed of dioleoyl phosphatidyl-glycerol (DOPG) and mixtures of
DOPG with dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine
(DOPC). These lipids also show fluid phase at room temperature (25
°C). As model membranes, we have used large unilamellar vesicles
(LUVs) to study the interaction of NK-2 with different phospholipids
using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), ζ potential, and
dynamic light scattering (DLS). In particular, the electrostatic behavior
as well as the size distribution of the membranes in the presence
of NK-2 was systematically characterized using ζ potential and
DLS, respectively. Thermodynamics of the interaction of this system
have been thoroughly investigated using ITC study. We have determined,
for the first time, the binding affinity of NK-2 with negatively charged
phospholipid membranes.

2 Results
2.1 ζ
Potential
The summary of results on ζ potential is illustrated in Figure 1. The ζ potential was
measured in LUV dispersion, made from DOPC, DOPG, DOPE–DOPG
(4:1) mixture, and mixtures of DOPC with DOPE and DOPG, before and
after introducing peptides (i.e., before and after ITC measurements).
As shown in Figure 1, ζ potential increases with increasing NK-2 to lipid molar
ratio (NK-2/L) and charge compensation occurs at different NK-2/L
for different lipid mixtures. Although phospholipids, such as DOPC
and a mixture of DOPC–DOPE, are neutral, they exhibit a low
negative value. A small negative ζ potential gets neutralized
at NK-2/L, ∼1:250. In comparison, charge neutralization happens
for DOPG at much higher NK-2/L (1:5). For DOPE–DOPG (4:1) mixtures,
charge compensation occurs at intermediate NK-2/L (1:25). These differences
are due to the fact that charge compensation occurs with respect to
charge lipids. Interestingly, the ζ potential shows its saturation
value, indicating overcharge compensation at different NK-2/L for
various lipid mixtures (Figure 1). The ζ potential of DOPG shows a saturation at a much
higher NK-2/L (3:10) than that of DOPC and DOPC–DOPE (1:250),
whereas the ζ potential for DOPE–DOPG and DOPC–DOPG
mixtures shows this at intermediate NK-2/L (1:20). The above result
clearly indicates that NK-2 has a stronger affinity toward the negatively
charged lipids.

molar ratios. Solid lines are intended only as guides to the points.
Error bars indicate the width of the distribution profile of ζ
potential.

2.2 Size
Distributions of LUV
LUVs composed
of pure DOPC and DOPG were found to be very stable, as no significant
change in the size distribution was seen in DLS measurement even a
couple of months later. The size distribution was measured for all
lipid mixtures before (absence of NK-2) and after (presence of NK-2)
ITC. The average diameter of LUV at different NK-2/lipid ratios is
presented in Figure 2. The error bars in Figure 2 represent the width of the distribution, which is a measure
of polydispersity of LUV. This error is relevant for understanding
the effect of NK-2 on the membranes. However, errors, obtained from
different measurements, are small and are not shown in the plot. Neutral
LUVs, made from DOPC and a mixture of DOPC and DOPE, do not exhibit
any significant change in their size distribution in the presence
of NK-2 (Figure 2a).
However, the average size of the negatively charged LUV increases
with increasing Cnk2. Interestingly, LUVs
made from pure DOPG show a dramatic increase in their average size
in the presence of NK-2 (Figure 2b). The width of the size distribution (error bar in Figure 2), indicating polydispersity,
also increases with the increase of Cnk2. In all samples containing DOPG, transparent LUV dispersion becomes
turbid after ITC measurement. Therefore, as the NK-2/lipid ratio is
increased, the sample exhibits a high value of size as well as high
polydispersity and eventually shows large aggregates. After a couple
of hours, the sample appears very turbid and hence the sample was
not suitable for DLS measurement. This behavior clearly indicates
that sample contains large aggregates induced by NK-2.

the presence of NK-2. (a) LUV are composed of DOPC and other phospholipid
mixtures, as indicated by the figure legend. (b) LUV composed of DOPG.

of the distribution.

2.3 Binding Affinity of NK-2 with Model Membranes
Measured from ITC
NK-2 of various concentrations, Cnk2 (100, 50, 40, 30, 25, and 10 μM) was
titrated with 4 mM of LUV made from the DOPE–DOPG (4:1) mixture.
For first few injections, heat flow remains constant, then starts
decreasing as less and less NK-2 is available for binding. Typical
raw data of ITC measurement at Cnk2 =
50 μM are shown in Figure 3. The lipid to NK-2 (L/NK-2) ratio at which saturation
of the heat flow occurs is ∼20:1, taking into account all lipids
(i.e., both monolayers of the LUV) interacting with the NK-2. The
overall binding reaction was endothermic for all Cnk2. Interestingly, when the endothermic signal attains
its saturation at ∼L/NK-2 = 20, further successive one to three
injections show an exothermic signal and then successive injections
contribute almost negligible heat (data not shown). This behavior
is displayed in the raw ITC thermogram when lower Cnk2, typically <40 μM, was used. For these concentrations,
saturation occurs before completing all injections of LUV. At the
beginning of the titration, there are plenty of peptides to bind with
lipids. Therefore, we have analyzed the data taking into account only
the initial part of the endothermic heat signals or the data where
all injections of LUV have been finished before the exothermic peaks
appear, i.e., for Cnk2 > 40 μM.
Although some of the isotherms can be fitted to one site binding model
given by microcal origin, it gives us the apparent binding constant
(Kapp), which is expected to vary with
concentrations of unbound or free NK-2 concentration. However, the
order of magnitude of the Kapp has been
found to be consistent with the value obtained from the surface partition
model. As the interaction of NK-2 with the negatively charged membranes
is primarily driven by the surface charge of the membranes, it is
desirable to fit the data taking into account the electrostatic contributions.
Therefore, the more relevant parameter would be the intrinsic binding
constant (Kint), where the surface concentration
of peptide (CM) is more relevant than
the bulk or free peptide concentration (Cf).

Figure 3 Titration calorimetry of 50 μM NK-2 with 4 mM DOPE–DOPG
(4:1) LUV (top); normalized heat of injection/mole of lipids, obtained
from the integration of the individual peak (bottom). Heat of dilution,
obtained from injecting 4 mM LUV into buffer, was subtracted from
the actual measurement. Here we assume, lipids from both monolayers
interact with the NK-2.

The model parameters, such as the extent of peptide binding
(Xb), Cf, CM, Kint, etc, obtained
numerically from experimental data, have been summarized in Table 1 (see Materials and Methods for details). In the case of DOPE–DOPG
mixture, it is interesting to observe that CM versus Xb behaves linearly for
lower lipid/NK-2, corresponding to 9–10 injections. However,
the tendency to increase the value of Kint is evident from Table 1. Above 10 injections, the Kint increases
with increasing the number of injections. Therefore, we have presented
only the linear part of the data to estimate the Kint. The possible reason for increasing the value of Kint at higher lipid/NK-2 has been discussed
later. The estimated values of molar binding enthalpy, ΔH, Kint, and binding entropy
ΔS, obtained from the surface partition model
with electrostatic contribution, have been summarized in Table 2.

b Here,
the Kint is the mean value calculated
from Table 1. Here,
we have assumed NK-2 interacts with
both leaflets of the membrane.29 The heat
of dilution has been subtracted from all data. ζ Potential in
the absence of NK-2 is also shown. The effective charge, zp, of the NK-2 when binding to the membrane has been taken
as 5. Note that ΔH for DOPG was estimated from
the first endothermic part (Figure 4) of the ITC thermogram.

Titration isotherm of DOPG is shown in Figure 4. Surprisingly, it shows few exothermic signals at L/NK-2
(4:1) between two regions of endothermic response. In this case, exothermic
peaks begin at much lower L/NK-2 (∼5). It is important to note
that such an exothermic signal also occurs at a similar PG/NK-2 ratio
for DOPE–DOPG (4:1) mixture. To understand the detailed behavior
of two regions of the isotherm, 100 μM NK-2 was titrated with
five different DOPG concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.6, and 1 mM). The
second region of the isotherm was accessed when two different Cnk2 (50, 35) were titrated with 10 mM DOPG LUV.
At present, we are not able to fit the entire isotherm with the model
available in the literature. However, we have determined the average
thermodynamic parameters obtained from the first region using a partition
model, taking into account the electrostatic contribution. The parameters
obtained from the model have been presented in Table 1. In the model, we have reduced the effective
charge of the NK-2 starting from the maximum charge +10 and found
the linear relationship between Xb and CM at zp = 5. This
can also be realized as L/NK-2 ∼5 to neutralize the membrane.

calorimetry data of DOPG, where NK-2 of 100 μM
is titrated with 5 mM of DOPG LUV (top); the corresponding normalized
heat per injection obtained from the integration of the individual
peak (bottom). Here, we have assumed NK-2 interacts with all lipids.

The large binding constants in
the case of DOPG and DOPE–DOPG
mixture, as shown in Table 1, suggest that NK-2 strongly binds to negatively charged membranes.
Therefore, it is interesting to check the affinity of NK-2 with neutral
lipids, such as DOPC and DOPE. Unfortunately, LUVs from DOPE alone
are not formed using the extrusion method used here. This is because
PE bilayers are more rigid than PCs in the fluid phase due to hydrogen
bonding between the head groups.30 Therefore,
bending of PE bilayers costs more energy, which in turn prevents the
formation of unilamellar vesicles. Therefore, a mixture of DOPE–DOPC
(4:1) was used to investigate the influence of PE in the binding isotherm.
A 100 μM NK-2 was titrated with 10 mM DOPE–DOPC (4:1).
For comparison, 10 mM of DOPE/DOPC (1:4) mixture was injected in to
three different Cnk2 (10, 100, and 200
μM). Similar experiments were done for DOPC. For DOPE–DOPC
(4:1), the heat signal is stronger than that of DOPE–DOPC (1:4)
but weaker than that of the DOPE–DOPG mixture. In all above
mixtures, the binding reaction is endothermic, whereas the simple
dilution experiment shows an exothermic response. The interaction
of NK-2 with DOPC and DOPC–DOPE LUV is too weak to obtain a
binding constant and other thermodynamic parameters. Considering all
ITC results, we can easily conclude that the interaction of NK-2 with
PE is stronger than with PC but weaker than with PG (PG ≫ PE
> PC).

3 Discussion
A systematic
investigation of the interaction of an important antimicrobial
peptide NK-2 with model membranes shows strong binding affinity toward
the negatively charged lipid, DOPG, as revealed from ITC and ζ
potential. The adsorption of NK-2 on the membranes, as indicated by
an increase in ζ potential (Figure 1), is primarily driven by electrostatic interaction
between negatively charged membranes and positively charged NK-2.
This is indeed an essential requirement for an AMP to exhibit antimicrobial
activity. However, the interaction is very weak in the case of neutral
DOPC and DOPC–DOPE membranes. The positive ζ potential
(+10 mV) of DOPC LUV at very low NK-2/L (1:250) suggests that NK-2
adsorbs even in PC membranes, which has not been reported in any of
the earlier studies. The ζ potential was measured previously
for DPPC in the gel phase, suggesting no significant interaction with
DPPC.22 However, a more biologically relevant
study would be to measure the ζ potential in the fluid phase.
X-ray scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed
that NK-2 has no influence even on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine vesicles that are in the fluid phase. They
have not measured the ζ potential of PC vesicles in the fluid
phase. Therefore, we cannot compare our results on DOPC with those
obtained in ref (22). However, the behavior of the ζ potential of DOPG and DOPE–DOPG
LUV were found to be consistent with those reported in the previous
studies for DPPG and DPPE22 and for LPS.11 Binding of NK-2 to the negatively charged membranes
results in charge neutralization. Therefore, the charge neutralization
depends on the amount of charge lipids present on the outer membranes.
This explains why very low NK-2/L (1:250) is required to neutralize
the membrane charge for zwitterionic phospholipids. The charge neutralization
at much higher NK-2/L (1:5) for DOPG suggests binding affinity to
PG is much stronger than that to PC. If the binding of NK-2 to charged
lipids is only due to electrostatic interaction, one would expect
the charge overcompensation at the same ζ potential. The fact
that we have obtained charge overcompensation at different ζ
potential for different lipids (see Figure 1) implies entropic contribution in these
systems. This is consistent with the ITC results in these mixtures.
For DOPG, ITC shows saturation, indicating all of the NK-2 binds to
the lipids at NK-2/L of ∼1:3, which is very similar to the
NK-2/L (3:10) for charge overcompensation, as found from ζ potential.
Similarly, ITC isotherm for DOPE–DOPG mixtures shows saturation
at NK-2/L (1:20), which is again consistent with the results of ζ
potential.

It is important to mention that change in the size
distribution
of the vesicles does not influence the ζ potential significantly.
The ζ potential is estimated from the Smoluchowski approximation,
where the Henry function f(κa) takes its maximum value as 1.5. In other words, ζ potential
is determined from the electrostatic double layer formation, which
does not depend on the size of the particle. Therefore, whatever change
we observe in the ζ potential is not due to change in size but
due to binding of peptide in the membrane.

The DLS technique
can, in principle, show the evidence of membrane–membrane
interaction mediated by NK-2 or the leakage of LUV induced by NK-2.
Size distributions of LUV made from various compositions of phospholipids
in the absence and presence of NK-2 clearly indicate stronger affinity
of NK-2 toward negatively charged membranes. It is interesting to
observe the turbid solution of LUV for those NK-2 concentrations in
which the ITC shows saturation before completing all injections. This
would mean that when there are no NK-2 available in the solution,
LUV, introduced from successive injections can adhere due to electrostatic
interaction between negatively charged injected LUV with positively
charged LUV already present in the solution. Adhesion can eventually
lead to the aggregation of LUV. This result clearly implies the antimicrobial
activity of NK-2 toward negatively charged lipids and is consistent
with the ζ potential result. Although size distributions do
not alter significantly for pure DOPC, the mixture of DOPE and DOPC
at 4:1 shows a slight increase in the average size (Figure 2a). Further, the presence of
PE with PC enhances the heat signals in the ITC experiment. This indicates
that PE plays a significant role in the interaction. Therefore, the
PE–PG system is indeed an appropriate model system to look
at the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, this composition happens
to be the major constituent of many bacterial membranes.

The
binding of a positively charged AMP with negatively charged
membrane usually leads to exothermic heat signal.31 The overall endothermic response observed in all isotherms
is thus intriguing. The overall endothermic response, found in all
lipid mixtures, can be explained in terms of entropy gain in liberating
water molecules from the hydration shell of LUV due to adsorption
of NK-2 at the interface. Entropic contribution can also arise due
to conformational change of NK-2 (random coil to α helix) in
the presence of lipids and also reorientation of NK-2 prior to the
formation of pores. Such transitions were found for this peptide in
a previous study by Olak et al.8 As the
initial L/NK-2 ratio is small, we would expect pores in almost all
LUVs. This is due to the fact that a threshold NK-2/L is required
for the formation of pores and this condition is already achieved
at the beginning of the isotherm.13,29 Our preliminary
result on giant unilamellar vesicles also shows the leakage of internal
fluid, supporting the pore formation on the membrane induced by NK-2
(data not shown). Although the appearance of the exothermic heat signal
at PG/NK-2 ∼5:1 in both DOPE–DOPG and DOPG mixtures
is very intriguing, the origin of these exothermic peaks is difficult
to confirm at present. However, we believe that when there are no
NK-2 available for binding, NK-2 can translocate through the pores
and interact with the bare LUV present in the solution due to further
injections. This process might lead to closing of pores, resulting
in an exothermic heat signal. This hypothesis is based on the assumption
that if the pore formation is endothermic, pore closure must be exothermic
in nature. It is true that the resultant heat due to pore closure
and binding of NK-2 together can cancel out. However, at this stage,
the unbound peptide-to-lipid molar ratio is too small to produce considerable
heat that can give rise
to an endothermic response. Such an exothermic response in between
two endothermic regions has not been observed in any of the earlier
studies.

Surprisingly, a second set of endothermic regions were
obtained
in the case of DOPG (Figure 4), even though there are no NK-2s available for further binding
with LUV. This can be explained qualitatively, as follows. It was
known by a previous study that desorption kinetics of NK-2 are much
slower than adsorption due to trapping of α helix at the membrane
interface.8 Therefore, it is expected that
no free NK-2 are available to give rise to a second region of isotherm.
Further injections of LUV can lead to attraction toward positively
charged LUV already present in the solution. When the membranes of
negatively charged LUV come closer
to the NK-2, water molecules in the hydration shell start to liberate
giving rise to the entropic gain of two membranes of LUV. Such membrane–membrane
interaction was also evidenced by the DLS measurement, as the average
size of LUV was found to increase.

NK-2 has a strong binding
affinity to the lipid bilayer interface,
relative to its water solubility, as evidenced from the ζ potential.
This leads to an excessive interfacial area due to NK-2 binding, which
increases the membrane tension. Such an increase in the membrane tension
results in the formation of transmembrane pores.29 It has been shown in the earlier study by Lee at al.29 that the asymmetry of interfacial tension due
to one-sided binding could lead to translocation of peptide (melittin)
via transient pores. The binding of peptide to both outer and inner
monolayers forms a stable pore at a critical peptide-to-lipid ratio.
Therefore, it is desirable to use total (current) lipid concentration
in the ITC cell to estimate the binding constant. It was also reported
earlier that some peptides are not able to translocate across the
membrane and only the outer monolayer of the membrane (60% of total
lipid) is available for binding.32 One
of the striking features obtained in the present study, compared to
those of other pore-forming peptides, such as melittin, is that the
NK-2 interacts only with negatively charged membranes. On the contrary,
melittin can interact significantly with the electrically neutral
PC membrane.13

It is evident from Table 2 that entropic contribution
(TΔS) is much larger than
that of enthalpy (ΔH). This is not surprising,
as hydrophobic interaction between
the hydrophobic part of NK-2 and hydrophobic core of the membranes
is entropic in origin. This is also necessary for the transmembrane
pore formation, observed in this system. The intrinsic binding constant Kint (= 2.5 × 108 M–1) of NK-2 found in DOPG (see Table 2) LUV is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that obtained
from earlier studies of different AMP.19,31 It is important
to note that Kint changes significantly
with the effective charge zp of the NK-2.
We have optimized the value of zp at 5
in the model so that a linear relationship of CM versus Xb with a small intercept
was maintained. This value can also be realized from the ratio L/NK-2
for which the charge compensation as well as the saturation of the
heat signals occurs. Previous ITC measurements on the NK-2-LPS system
have shown similar endothermic and exothermic response to the binding
heat depending on the structure of LPS.11 However, these results were not analyzed. As evidenced from Table 1, the slight increase
in the Kint with increasing lipid/NK-2
is the consequence of membrane–membrane interaction induced
by NK-2. This result is also supported by DLS experiment, where we
have observed an increase in the size distribution.

The mechanism
of action of NK-2 on negatively charged membranes
has been inferred from ITC result, as illustrated in Figure 5. Initially, positively charged
NK-2 in the coiled configuration,8 when
binds to an outer monolayer of the membranes, increases the membrane
tension and induces transient pores to translocate NK-2 into the inner
monolayer.29 The increase in membrane tension
was also evidenced from the membrane thinning effect of melittin and
other AMPs (13, 25, and 29). Such tension-induced (stretch-activated)
pore formation has also been reported for an AMP Magainin 2.33 Although there have been no earlier reports
on NK-2, we expect that NK-2 also induces membrane tension, as in
the case of melittin or Magainin 2. As the concentration of lipid
is increased (i.e., the number of LUV), the NK-2 may come out through
the pores and negatively charged LUV move closer to the positively
charged vesicles due to electrostatic attraction. This process eventually
leads to aggregation of vesicles via NK-2 bridges. The process of
aggregation has been clearly envisaged from the size distribution.
The increase in the value of Kint, as
mentioned in Results section, might be the
consequence of the aggregation of vesicles at a higher lipid to NK-2
ratio.

4 Conclusions
We have systematically studied
the interaction of NK-2 with phospholipid
membranes to obtain insights into the antimicrobial activity. The
binding affinity of NK-2 to the negatively charged membranes, PG,
as well as the neutral phospholipids PC and PE was determined using
ITC and ζ potential. We compare binding affinity of NK-2 to
PG, PE, and PC as PG ≫ PE > PC. Weaker affinity toward neutral
phospholipids suggests that interactions of NK-2 with lipids are mainly
governed by negatively charged lipids, which are major constituents
of the bacterial membranes. The very weak affinity of NK-2 toward
the PC membrane (which is the major constituent of eukaryotic cell
membranes) propels the development of peptide antibiotics. The evidence
of pores on these membranes seen in the present study implies antimicrobial
activity of NK-2. The significant increase in the size of negatively
charged LUV, found in DLS measurement, confirms membrane–membrane
interactions induced by NK-2 in these systems, which eventually leads
to vesicle aggregates in the solution. Finally, we have proposed the
mechanism of action of NK-2 based on our experimental results. More
detailed studies are required to understand the mechanism of the kinetic
process involved during pore formation. As already established, the
NK-2 can be used as therapeutics to kill malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. It also shows activity against Escherichia coli and preferentially kills cancer
cells. Further, low toxicity toward human cells is a great advantage
for the development of antibiotics. Therefore, the present study will
definitely reinforce the therapeutics applications. Nevertheless,
our study provides important insights into the NK-2-lipids interaction.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Materials
Dioleoyl
phosphatidylcholine
(DOPC), dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and dioleoyl phosphatidyl-glycerol
(DOPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and peptide NK-2 (KILRGVCKKIMRTFLRRISKDILTGKK-NH2)
was purchased from WITA GmbH, Berlin, Germany. They were used without
further purification.

5.2 Preparation of LUV
An appropriate
amount of lipid solution in chloroform (concentration of stock solution
is 10 mg/mL) was transferred to a 10 mL glass vial. The organic solvent
was removed by gently passing nitrogen gas. The sample was then placed
for a couple of hours in a desiccator connected to a vacuum pump to
remove the traces of the solvent. Two and a half milliliters of 1
mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.4 adjusted with 1 M KOH)
was added to the dried lipid film so that final desired concentration
was obtained. The lipid film with the buffer was kept overnight at
4 °C to ensure the better hydration of phospholipid heads. Vortexing
of the hydrated lipid film for about 30 min produces multilamellar
vesicles (MLVs). Sometimes long vortexing is required to make uniform
lipid mixtures. LUVs were prepared by the extrusion method using LiposoFast-Pneumatic
from AVESTIN (Canada). MLV suspensions are extruded successively through
polycarbonate membranes having pore diameters of 400, 200, and 100
nm. This results in the formation of a well-defined size of LUV. This
method produces vesicles of diameter ∼100 nm, as measured by
dynamic light scattering.

5.3 Measurement of ζ
Potential and Size
Distributions Using DLS
ζ Potential and vesicle sizes
were measured with a Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern Instruments. Same
LUV, as used for ITC, was used for these measurements. The instrument
uses 2 mW He–Ne laser of wavelength 633 nm to illuminate the
sample. ζ Potential is obtained from the electrophoretic mobility
by laser Doppler velocimetry using the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski
equation.34 1  where η
and ϵ are the coefficient
of viscosity and the permittivity of the aqueous medium, respectively.
The Henry function, f(κa)
depends on the inverse Debye length (κ) and the radius (a) of the vesicle.

In DLS, back scattered light at
an angle of 173° is detected and sent to a digital signal processing
correlator. The rate of decay of intensity–intensity autocorrelation
function was measured, which was used to calculate the size of the
LUV using the Stokes–Einstein relation , D being the diffusion
constant and kT the thermal energy. The average ζ
potential and size were obtained from 3 to 4 successive measurements.
Each measurement includes 100–200 runs. The same cuvette is
used for both ζ potential and DLS measurements. All experiments
were performed at 25 °C.

5.4 Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
The binding affinity of NK-2
to the lipids was measured using a VP-ITC
microcalorimeter produced by MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA). In all
experiments, the injection syringe was filled with degassed LUV suspension.
The sample cell (1.442 mL) contains various concentrations of NK-2
dissolved in 1 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The reference cell is filled
with HEPES buffer only. All solutions were degassed prior to filling
the syringe and ITC cells to eliminate air bubbles. A series of 28
injections, each of 8 μL, was introduced into the sample cell
at 300 s intervals. All experiments were performed at 25 °C.
Interaction of NK-2 with lipids produces a characteristic heat signal.
The amount of heat of binding in every injection was obtained by integrating
individual calorimetry traces. In a control experiment, LUV was injected
into only buffer to measure the heat of dilution. The heat of dilution
(∼−0.1 μcal/injection) was found to be small as
compared to the actual measurement. Other heat of dilution (∼−0.07 μcal/injection),
appearing from the dilution of NK-2, was even smaller, as compared
to dilution of the former case. However, we have obtained heat per
injection by subtracting heat of dilution, obtained from injecting
LUV into buffer, from the actual measurement. ITC data have been analyzed
without altering the lipid concentration. This would ensure that the
peptides interact with both monolayers of the membrane. All dilution
measurements show exothermic signal. The binding constant (K) and binding enthalpy (ΔH) and
Gibbs free energy (ΔG = −RT ln K) and entropic contributions
(TΔS = ΔH – ΔG) of the binding kinetics can
be obtained from the model, as described by Domingues et al.31 A summary of the model is described below.

5.5 Surface Partition Model with Electrostatic
Contributions
In a typical ITC experiment, when LUVs are
injected into the peptide solution, the total concentration of the
peptide is the sum of the concentration of bound peptides and the
free peptides. The apparent binding constant Kapp is defined as Xb = KappCf, where Xb is the extent of peptide binding per mole
of lipid and Cf is the free peptide concentration
of the solution. When the charged peptide adsorbs, the membrane becomes
changed. Hence, further adsorption of peptide onto the membrane is
restricted by the electrostatic repulsion. Therefore, Kapp is no longer a constant but rather changes with Cf. Therefore, the most relevant binding parameter
would be the intrinsic binding constant Kint (Xb = KintCM), which is assumed to be directly
proportional to the surface concentration of the peptide in the membrane.
The model essentially calculates Xb and CM for each injection of the ITC experiment.
As the CM of the peptide is governed by
the electrostatic contribution, it is determined by the Boltzmann
distribution. 2  where zp is the
effective peptide charge. The maximum charge of NK-2 is +10. F is the Faraday constant (= charge of 1 mol of electron
= electronic charge × Avogadro’s number = 96 485
C/mol). ψ0 is the surface potential. R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute
temperature. As the ψ0 is related to surface charge
density, σ, of the peptide, it can be estimated from the well-known
Gouy–Chapman theory. As the ζ potential can be a good
approximation to the surface potential, we have taken ψ0 same as the ζ potential. Now we need to know the ζ
potential for each peptide-to-lipid molar ratio obtained after every
injection. However, we have measured the ζ potential for few
peptide-to-lipid ratios. To obtain the ζ potential for all peptide-to-lipid
ratios required for the calculation of CM, we have fitted the ζ potential data to a Hill equation originally
used to describe cooperative binding of ligand to macromolecules.35 Hence, we have obtained ζ potentials for
all required concentrations from interpolation or extrapolation of
the fitted curve. Now, for each data point, the concentration of the
free peptide and ψ0 have been determined. Once Cf and ψ0 are known, CM can be calculated. We now discuss briefly
how Xb and Cf have been estimated from an ITC experiment.

In an ITC experiment
(lipids into peptide injection), the Xb and the enthalpy change ΔH per mole of peptides
can be measured directly. The ΔH has been estimated
from the sum over all heat per injection divided by the number of
moles of peptide in the calorimeter cell. 3  where
δhi is the heat
per injection in the ITC experiment. Cp0 is the initial
molar concentration of peptide in the ITC cell, and Vcell is the volume of the ITC cell. Now, the
extent of peptide binding, Xb, per mole
of lipid after completion of ith is given by 4  where Vinj is
the volume of each injection with lipid of concentration CL. Now, the fraction of bound peptide after ith injection is given by  where the free peptide concentration Cf can be obtained from 5  Now, the Kapp can
be obtained from the Xb and Cf. Therefore, CM and Kint can be estimated for each pair of Xb and Cf, obtained
from experimental data, as discussed above.
