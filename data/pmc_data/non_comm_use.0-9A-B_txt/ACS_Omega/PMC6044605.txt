By utilizing the
capillary-force-driven action, a novel polydiacetylene-based
sensor on the porous silica plate was developed within 30 s for π-diacetylene
monomers with variable chain lengths. This method enables one to utilize
diacetylene monomers even with the shorter alkyl chain length of C18–C21,
which has not been possible with conventional methods. The invented
sensor platform employing shorter monomers was found to perform better,
as was demonstrated for gaseous and aqueous analytes, i.e., ammonia
gas and nucleic acids in aqueous phase. This new polydiacetylene platform
opens up the development of quick and easy fabrication and the use
of chemical and biochemical chips.

Introduction
π-Conjugated
polydiacetylenes have attracted great interest
as component of sensors by virtue of their bichromatic properties.
These polymers are formed via a 1,4-addition reaction upon exposure
to UV light and undergo a transition from a blue, nonfluorescent form
to a red, fluorescent form in response to structural changes induced
by external stimuli.1−6 Thereby, functionalization of the surface of polydiacetylene with
molecular receptors has been used to develop label-free biological/chemical
sensors for the detection of influenza virus, toxin, oligonucleotides,
antigens, proteins, and bacteria.7−15 These sensors have taken conventional forms of Langmuir–Blodgett
thin films, bilayer vesicles, and two-dimensional array chips. However,
they generally take a long time to fabricate, from a few hours to
a few days. On materials selection aspect, diacetylenes with shorter
alkyl chains are expected to be more sensitive to external perturbations,16−19 with polydiacetylene with shorter alkyl chains requiring less thermal
energy to disturb the organized structure, whereas more thermal energy
is required in the case of long alkyl chains.18,19 However, bilayer or multilayer structures made of diacetylene monomers
having shorter (less than C23) alkyl chains often become unstable
in aqueous solutions.16 To overcome such
limitations in the selection of monomers, we propose a direct and
simple solution of utilizing silica plates typically used for the
separation of nonvolatile mixtures by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).20,21 In this study, we developed a capillary-force-driven adsorption
process on silica surface that works successfully for diactylene monomers
of variable chain length, especially those having shorter alkyl chains
that are more sensitive to external perturbations. The resulting hydrophobic
polydiacetylene-on-silica (polydiacetylene/silica) plate is investigated
as a novel diagnostic sensor platform for both chemical gaseous and
biomolecular analytes.

Results and Discussion
We aimed
at developing a novel label-free sensor by allowing a
solution of diacetylene monomers as the mobile phase to be drawn up
through a porous silica plate by capillary action. A schematic diagram
of the adsorption of diacetylene monomers on a silica plate is shown
in Scheme 1a. A bare
silica plate was dipped into a solution of diacetylene monomers dissolved
in tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the solution was drawn up spontaneously
through the plate by capillary-force-driven flow, resulting in a uniform
adsorption of diacetylene on the silica plate within 30 s, as shown
in Scheme 1a. The diacetylene/silica
plate was exposed to 254 nm UV light for 30 s, and the blue-phase
polydiacetylene/silica plate turned red-phase plate by external perturbation,
as shown in Scheme 1b. Four types of diacetylene monomers with different alkyl chains
are used (Scheme 1c).
10,12-Pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA; 25 carbon atoms, C25), 10,12-tricosadiynoic
acid (TCDA; 23 carbon atoms, C23), 10,12-heneicosadiynoic acid (HCDA;
21 carbon atoms, C21), and 10,12-octadecadiynoic acid (ODDA; 18 carbon
atoms, C18) comprise the same carboxylic acid head group but different
alkyl chain length. Bilayer vesicle structures made of monomers having
same as or shorter alkyl chains than HCDA are unstable in aqueous
solutions.16 Among the monomers tested
in the present study, ODDA having 18 carbon atoms is the shortest
diacetylene monomer. The surface morphology of silica plates changed
by the physisorption of PCDA (C25) monomer, as observed with the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 1a. The contact angle of the bare silica plate
could not be measured because its surface is truly porous. A distinct
increase in the roughness was observed when the concentration of the
monomer solution was 200 μg/μL or higher. The change in
wettability following physisorption of PCDA monomer is associated
with the extent of hydrophobicity related with the formation of larger
rough domains at concentrations of 200–500 μg/μL.
The choice of diacetylene monomers out of C18–C25 also alters
the surface morphology, as shown in Figure 1b. Surfactants with different alkyl chain
lengths have been used to study the effect of size and morphological
control of micro/nanostructures.22−24 The cases of C21–C25
monomers formed larger domains, whereas those of C18 monomer observed
smaller domains. Capillary-driven method also has the advantage,
that a uniform coverage of diacetylene domains was formed compared
to that of samples just dropping the diacetylene solution onto the
glass surface, as shown in Figure S1. The
real-time polymerization of PCDA (C25)/silica plate is shown in Movie S1, Supporting Information. Uniform polymerization
was identified by every diacetylene derivative adsorbed on the silica
plate, with blue/dark blue derivatives at a concentration of 500 μg/μL,
as shown in Figure 1b. Concentration-dependent polymerization of various diacetylene/silica
plates at 100–500 μg/μL is also shown in Figure S2. Blue/dark blue is expected to be related
to the density of polymerizable domains. The larger the domain size
of polydiacetylene adsorbed on silica plate, the darker the blue.
A large domain means that a large number of diacetylene molecules
were adsorbed on the silica plate. However, ODDA (C18) molecules were
less adsorbed by utilizing capillary-driven force and formed less
domain comparison with the case forming relatively large domain on
glass substrate just dropping molecules (Figure S1). An exact understanding of why ODDA (C18) molecules were
less adsorbed by utilizing capillary-driven force will be constructed
in the further research.

or higher. (b) SEM images (left) showing the surface morphology and

The wettability
of silica plates was changed by the physisorption
of diacetylene monomers at a concentration of 500 μg/μL,
as shown in Table 1. Upon adsorption of diacetylene, the surface became hydrophobic.
The contact angles of silica plates with adsorbed PCDA (C25), TCDA
(C23), HCDA (C21), and ODDA (C21) were 150, 145, 120, and 80°,
respectively. The hydrophobicity of the surface is related to the
altered surface morphology, as observed in Figure 1b.

The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform
infrared (ATR-FTIR)
spectra of polydiacetylene/silica plates arising from polymerization
are shown in Figure 2a, and peak assignments are listed in Table 2. Unlike the spectrum of the bare silica
plate, the spectra of the polydiacetylene/silica plates have methylene
stretching bands at 2921–2919 and 2848–2846 cm–1, as well as a hydrogen-bonded carbonyl stretching band at 1693–1690
cm–1, which is consistent with the previously reported
results.16 The retention of these peak
positions in our spectra indicates that the diacetylene monomers were
well adsorbed on the silica plates via capillary action. It is expected
that the intensity of TCDA (C23) and HCDA (C21) of FTIR was stronger
than that of ODDA (C18). Molar concentration at the concentration
of 500 μg/μL of PCDA (C25), TCDA (C23), HCDA (C21), and
ODDA (C21) is 1.33, 1.44, 1.56, and 1.80 M, respectively. The number
of ODDA molecules is the highest in this experiment. However, ODDA
(C18) molecules were less adsorbed by utilizing capillary-driven force
and formed less domain comparison with the case forming relatively
large domain on glass substrate just dropping molecules (Figure S1). PCDA (C25) with the minimum number
of molecules has a relatively weak peak intensity. A detailed understanding
will be constructed in the further research. To investigate the thermochromic
properties of diacetylene/silica plates, polymerized diacetylene/silica
plates were gradually heated while fluorescence was monitored using
a fluorescence microscope. The quantitative fluorescence obtained
from the fluorescent images of polydiacetylene/silica plates at different
temperatures is shown in Figure 2b. The annealing temperature was increased gradually
from 25 °C, and the PCDA/silica plate started to emit fluorescence
at ∼65 °C. In contrast, the silica plate with adsorbed
ODDA (C18), which has a shorter alkyl chain length than PCDA (C25),
showed a much more sensitive response to heat and started to emit
fluorescence at ∼40 °C. This difference in sensitivity
is related to the difference in alkyl chain length. Generally, less
thermal energy is required to disturb the organized structure of polydiacetylene
with shorter alkyl chains, whereas more thermal energy is required
in the case of long alkyl chains.18,19 The ATR-FTIR
spectra and thermochromic properties of polydiacetylene/silica plates
indicate the successful fabrication of a more sensitive polydiacetylene-on-silica
plate that also preserves the intrinsic optical characteristics of
polydiacetylene.

of silica plates with adsorbed diacetylene monomers. The transition
temperatures to emit fluorescence are ∼65 °C (PCDA (C25)/silica

(HCDA (C21)/silica plate), and ∼40 °C (ODDA (C18)/silica
plate), respectively.

We applied this system first to the detection of ammonia
moiety
in the gaseous phase; fluorescence intensities and ATR-FTIR spectra
after reaction with ammonia gas are shown in Figure 3. The fluorescence images of polydiacetylene/silica
plates after reaction with ammonia gas are shown in Figure S3a. Interestingly, red fluorescence was strongly emitted
by the ODDA (C18)/silica plate, which has shorter alkyl chains than
the other plates, as shown in Figure 3a. Unfortunately, the PCDA (C25)/silica plate emitted
relatively less fluorescence. In all of the ATR-FTIR spectra, the
carbonyl band at 1693–1690 cm–1 was replaced
by a carboxylic acid band at 1546–1545 cm–1, as shown in Figure 3b. This indicates that the peak shift is caused by ionic interactions
between the carbonyl group of diacetylene and the amine group of ammonia.
These results suggest that the interaction with ammonia resulted commonly
in the chemical modification of the diacetylene’s head groups;
however, there occurs insufficient energy to perturb the organized
structure of polydiacetylene based on PCDA monomer having long alkyl
chains.18,19 Capillary-driven fabrication method also
had the advantage of the ability to detect ammonia gas compared to
samples just dropping the diacetylene solution onto the glass surface,
as shown in Figure S3b,c. The capillary-driven
polydiacetylene/silica plates having a uniform coverage of domains
showed a stronger response than polydiacetylene just dropped on glass
substrate.

diacetylene monomers after reaction with ammonia gas (inset: scheme
of blue-to-red transition of polydiacetylene-on-silica). (b) ATR-FTIR
spectra of silica plates with adsorbed diacetylene monomers before
(solid line) and after (dashed line) reaction with ammonia gas. Peaks
were shifted from 1693–1690 to 1546–1545 cm–1 in all of the cases after reaction with ammonia gas.

In addition, a “hydrophobic” PCDA
(C25)/silica plate
enabled formation of liquid drop arrays containing aqueous solutions
with pH values of ∼1 and ∼13, as shown in Movie S2, Supporting Information. The blue-to-red
transition was immediately observed with dropping of high-pH solution,
i.e., sodium hydroxide solution. Previous studies have established
that the chromatic change upon adjusting the pH values can be attributed
to the repulsive Coulombic interactions during surface ionization,
which force adjacent chains apart and trigger a conformational change.25−27 The acid–base properties of end group at the diacetylene
monomers are confirmed to be expected for spatially confined interfacial
carboxyl groups exhibiting attenuated acidity. In addition, the blue-to-red
transition was related to the extent of deprotonation of the interfacial
carboxyl groups, which accounts for the occurrence of the blue-to-red
response triggered by the high pH range.

This novel hydrophobic
polydiacetylene-on-silica system is then
applied to label-free DNA detection experiments, as shown in Figure 4. A schematic diagram
of the formation of aqueous liquid droplet arrays on the ODDA (C18)/silica
and the successive hybridization of target DNA within a sessile drop
lying on the plate is shown in Figure 4a. The probe DNA solution was applied to the ODDA/silica
plate that had been treated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). After exposure
to 254 nm UV light, target DNA solution was applied to the plate.
Hybridization of immobilized probe DNA with target DNA induces a phase
transition of polydiacetylene from blue to red. By wisely utilizing
the more sensitive ODDA/silica plate, we were able to detect target
DNA within 30 min. Fluorescence images of ODDA/silica plate after
reaction with DNA on an overall surface area are shown in Figure S4. The highest level of red fluorescence
was emitted when the ODDA/silica plate was reacted with a solution
of perfectly matched DNA, whereas little fluorescence was emitted
when the plate was reacted with a random DNA sequence, as shown in Figure 4b. This indicates
that complementary hybridization of probe and target DNA induced a
change in the π-conjugation length of the polydiacetylene backbone,
resulting in fluorescence emission. The fluorescence of the ODDA/silica
plate following hybridization of target DNA was also examined as a
function of the concentration of target DNA, as shown in Figure 4c. The target DNA
was found to be detectable label-free up to a concentration of 1 nM
scale. As the concentration of target DNA increased, the relative
fluorescence intensity also increased, suggesting that the amount
of hybridization far more strongly evoked the change in the π-conjugation
length of the ODDA-based polydiacetylene backbone.

of the ODDA/silica plate (b) after reaction with target DNA and random
DNA both at 500 nM, (c) after reaction with various concentrations
of target DNA ranging from 500 nM to 500 pM. The following DNA sequences
were used: NH2-5′-ATCCTTATCAATATTTAACAATAATCC-3′
for probe DNA, 3′-TAGGAATAGTTATAAATTGTTATTAGG-5′ for
target DNA, and 3′-AAAAAAAAAA-5′ for random DNA.

Conclusions
In summary, diacetylene/silica
plates were fabricated via capillary-driven-force
within 30 s. This quick and easy method enabled one to utilize diacetylene
monomers with long (C25) to shorter (C18) alkyl chain length. FTIR
spectroscopy, electron and fluorescence microscopies, and thermochromics
analyses confirmed that this hybrid system retained the intrinsic
optical function of polydiacetylene and showed better sensitivity
against external stimulus when shorter chain monomer was adopted.
Hydrophobic polymerized ODDA (C18)-on-silica plate was found to be
much more capable of detecting ammonia gas and nucleic acids in liquid
drop arrays. We believe that this new polydiacetylene platform fabricated
on a porous silica plate finds on-site applications where simple and
immediate treatments need to be met.

Experimental Section
Materials
10,12-Pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA, C25),
10,12-tricosadiynoic acid (TCDA, C23), 10,12-heneicosadiynoic acid
(HCDA, C21), and 10,12-octadecadiynoic acid (ODDA, C18) were purchased
from GFS Chemicals. 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and ammonia
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Silica-coated thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) plate named TLC Silica gel 60 F254 glassplate was
purchased from Merck, Germany. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by
Bioneer, Korea. The anthrax lethal factor sequence was used as probe
DNA: the anthrax lethal factor sequence was used as probe DNA: NH2-5′-ATCCTTATCAATATTTAACAATAATCC-3′. The target
DNA sequence was 3′-TAGGAATAGTTATAAATTGTTATTAGG-5′,
and the random DNA sequence (control) was 3′-AAAAAAAAAA-5′.

Preparation of Silica Plates Coated with Diacetylene Monomers
Diacetylene monomers were dissolved in THF at concentrations ranging
from 20 to 500 μg/μL. Silica-coated TLC plates were dipped
into diacetylene-THF solution, and migration of the solution by capillary
action resulted in the adsorption of diacetylene on the silica plates
within 30 s. The plates were removed from their solutions and dried
at room temperature.

Thermochromism of Diacetylene/Silica Plates
Diacetylene/silica
plates were exposed to 254 nm UV light for 30 s. The plates were heated
on a hot plate and fluorescence was analyzed in situ. Real-time temperature
was monitored with a thermometer.

Reaction of Ammonia Gas
with Diacetylene/Silica Plates
A chamber was flushed with
N2 gas, and then a clean petri
dish containing 1 drop of ammonia solution was set in the chamber.
Diacetylene/silica plates were exposed to 254 nm UV light for 30 s
and took place in the chamber immediately after exposure to UV light
and left there for 30 min. The concentration of ammonia gas in the
chamber, measured with an analogue gas detector (GASTEC), was ∼500
ppm.

Surface Treatment and Reaction of DNA with the ODDA (C18)/Silica
Plate
NHS (2.0 mM) and EDC (4.0 mM) were dissolved in MES
buffer (0.2 M, pH 6). The prepared NHS/EDC solution was reacted with
an ODDA/silica plate for 30 min to allow NHS to react with the carboxylic
acids. A solution of NH2-functionalized probe DNA in deionized
(DI) water (500 nM) was reacted with the NHS-treated ODDA/silica plate
for 30 min, and then the plate was rinsed with DI water. Polymerization
was initiated by exposing the plate to 254 nm UV light for 30 s. Target
and random DNA were also reacted with plates for 30 min and rinsed
with DI water.

Instrumentation
The surface morphologies
were analyzed
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (S-4300, Hitachi, Japan).
Prior to SEM analysis, diacetylene/silica plates were coated with
platinum for 60 s. Surface wettability was measured using a contact
angle meter (CA-DT, Kyowa, Japan). A compact UV lamp (UVG-11, UVP)
was used for polymerization of diacetylene. Fluorescence microscopy
measurements were made using a reflected fluorescence system (BX 51,
Olympus, Japan) equipped with a mercury lamp. Fluorescence images
were captured after excitation by 510–550 nm waves. The filters
used ranged from 590 nm infrared waves. Quantitative fluorescence
values were measured using Adobe Photoshop CS3. A Spectrum GX1 (PerkinElmer)
was used to acquire ATR-FTIR spectra for the diacetylene/silica plates.
A mercury–cadmium–telluride detector cooled with liquid
nitrogen was used, and 512 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1 were accumulated to obtain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio.
