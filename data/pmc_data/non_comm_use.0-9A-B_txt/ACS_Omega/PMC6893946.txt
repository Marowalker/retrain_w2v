The
study deals with the synthesis and characterization of the
hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide (HMPA) copolymer and its functional
property evaluation in mixed polymer-gemini surfactant systems for
application in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The copolymer was initially
prepared in the laboratory using acrylamide and N-phenylacrylamide monomer units via an addition polymerization route.
The synthesized copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared
and proton nuclear magnetic resonance to identify suitable functional
groups in the compound. Gel permeation chromatography tests showed
that the polymer has a molecular weight of 2.098 × 105 Da. Copolymer solution showed favorable tolerance to variations
in temperature and salinity. Salt precipitation studies identified
tolerance limit up to 25% NaCl at a temperature of 343 K. Viscosity
of HMPA fluids showed an increase with increasing concentration. Interestingly,
salt addition until 1.0% NaCl showed an increase in solution viscosity
owing to the electrostatic shielding of the HMPA polymer and strengthened
intermolecular association of the hydrophobic groups. This behavior
is against physicochemical properties observed in the case of conventional
polymers but exhibits promising functionality in EOR processes wherein
better oil mobility control is desired under subsurface conditions.
Gemini surfactants accommodate onto “vacant adsorption”
sites onto the liquid surface, improving the interfacial adsorption
property and reducing surface tension. In the presence of gemini surfactant
polymers forming mixed nanoemulsion fluid systems with favorable pseudoplastic
character, their viscosities initially increase with surfactant concentration
due to binding of surfactant molecules to hydrophobic junctions of
polymer chains to form mixed micelles. Eventually, polymer hydrophobes
get saturated with surfactant micelles, and viscosity decreases due
to electrostatic repulsion among surfactant micelles. Dynamic light
scattering analyses confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion droplets
with sizes of <310 nm in the case of {surfactant + copolymer} encapsulation.
Zeta potential measurements showed that an increase in 14-6-14 gemini
surfactant concentration enhanced the stability of nanoemulsion fluid
due to increasing zeta potential values. However, the nonionic SF-6-SF
surfactant does not affect the zeta potential of nanoemulsions. Surfactant
addition reduced the oil-aqueous interfacial tension of polymer solutions
to several magnitudes of an order of 10–1 to 10–2 mN/m. Contact angle studies identified the ability
of the polymer as well as polymer-surfactant nanoemulsions to alter
the wettability of the reservoir rock from the intermediate-wet (90°–120°)
to strongly water-wet state (<20°) at different temperatures.
Analyzed formulations showed favorable miscibility with crude oil
at 343 K. In summary, HMPA/gemini surfactant-based emulsions possess
promising physicochemical and stabilization attributes for application
in EOR.

Introduction
Polymer flooding is a promising enhanced
oil recovery (EOR) technique
involving the use of water-soluble polymeric compounds to mobilize
and extract in situ crude oil from petroleum reservoir. Addition of
the polymer increases the viscosity of the injected fluid, thus reducing
the water/oil mobility ratio. This allows better sweep of crude oil
trapped within reservoir pores by capillary and viscous forces and
is beneficial in controlling the crude oil mobility. This encompasses
the “primary conformance-improvement benefit of polymer water
flooding” as per Sydansk’s theory.1 Due to this, the development and optimization of novel
polymeric systems have become an important field of study among petroleum
engineers and researchers alike.1−4 However, the effectiveness of polymer injection depends
on a number of factors, namely, flow behavior of solution, area of
injection, permeability variations, and the area of the front surface
of reservoir.5 Furthermore, drawbacks faced
during polymer flood EOR comprise low stability to high temperature
and salinity conditions.6 Acrylamide-based
synthetic polymers are commonly employed in the oil production sector
due to favorable rheological attributes.7 It is necessary to improve the physicochemical attributes of polyacrylamide
polymers with resistance to dynamic changes in an external environment,
by synthesizing copolymer systems for extracting oil under harsh reservoir
conditions.8 Acrylamide polymers structurally
modified with a hydrophobic monomer have recently become the subject
of extensive research.9−12 Above a certain polymer aggregate concentration, the polymer chain
forms intermolecular hydrophobic association, which leads to the strengthening
of polymolecular interactions and formation of the network structure.13−17 The synthesized block copolymers exhibit favorable viscosifying
properties. Therefore, hydrophobically modified copolymers achieve
oil displacement and mobilization, preventing backflow and retrapment
of oil within pore spaces.18

Hydrophobically
connecting polymers/polymeric materials can demonstrate
intriguing physicochemical traits under dynamic conditions. Thus,
it is conceivable to dodge the irreversible mechanical dissociation
among interacting molecules, which happens to high molecular weight
polymers under high shear.19 Polymers with
the amphiphilic structure of hydrophobically associative polymers
exhibit synergistic interfacial and rheological properties in diverse
systems.20−22 Synthesis techniques have been developed to achieve
high-molecular-weight block copolymers with enhanced rheological attributes.12−18 The functionality of hydrophobically modified copolymer systems
comprises a wide array of enhanced physicochemical attributes and
diverse research areas. In the past few years, several types of associative
copolymers have been developed, depending on the synthesis technique,
nature of interacting monomers, mode of structural attachment of hydrophobes
as end attachment (telechelic polymers) or distribution as small blocks
in the hydrophilic polymeric backbone (multisticker polymers).18−22 Such systems have found application in cosmetics, drilling fluids,
preparative chemistry, and as materials/coatings for food, fiber,
and leather. However, their application in the field of enhanced oil
recovery (EOR) is relatively new and further needs to be optimized/designed
as a chemical injection fluid in petroleum industry. Van Doren et
al. studied the optimization of polymer flooding to increase NPV of
the field and they also demonstrated by full field scale reservoir
simulation of polymer flooding.5 This laid
the groundwork for formulation of different pure and mixed polymer
systems for oil extraction processes. Caulfield and co-workers studied
the degradation of polyacrylamide under different conditions and proved
that copolymer synthesis is vital for further advancement.6 Wei et al. discussed the mechanistic processes
responsible for favorable rheological attributes of polymer and copolymer
fluids.7 Dai et al. synthesized the polyacrylamide-based
polymer and showed the effect of salinity and temperature on stability.8 Kopperud and others showed the interaction of
polyacrylamide and hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide with surfactant
SDS.17 They showed non-Newtonian shear
thinning as well as thixotropic behavior under surfactant concentration,
which are considered desirable for EOR processes. Magny et al. showed
the rheological behavior between the hydrophobic polymer and anionic/nonionic/cationic
surfactant and identified favorable systems for petroleum recovery
function.23 Synthesized polymer interaction
with a surfactant and its emulsification properties are essential
for their potential application for enhanced oil recovery. Wang and
Tam studied the interaction between the charged polymer and surfactant
molecules and found that electrostatic interactions influence their
stabilization and flow behavior.24 This
mechanism was further improved in 2018 by Wang et al. during which
hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding were identified as primary
interactive forces, which affect physicochemical properties of monomeric
surfactant-polymer fluids in terms of interfacial activity and rheology.25 Kothencz et al. and others and Al-Sabagh et
al. also studied the interaction between polymer chains and surfactant
micelles/molecules and optimized fluid compositions to control their
relative effects on mixed polymer-surfactant systems.26,27 Surfactant-polymer systems are functional in situations wherein
high tolerance to salt is necessary. The synergistic interactions
between the polymer and surfactant play a pivotal role in understanding
mechanistic interactions, as well as devising/optimizing novel chemical
displacing fluids. Our current article deals with the interaction
between novel synthesized HMPA and cationic/nonionic gemini surfactant
systems that has not yet been investigated for EOR previously.

This paper deals with the synthesis and functional application
of a hydrophobically modified copolymer {acrylamide + N-phenylacrylamide} in EOR processes. Characterization studies were
performed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, gel permeation
chromatography (GPC), salt tolerance test, and viscosity measurements.
Polymer interactions with gemini surfactants (14-6-14 GS and SF-6-SF
GS) were studied in an aqueous solution phase and their physicochemical
properties were studied. The viscosity and viscoelastic behavior of
surfactant-copolymer mixtures were studied under dynamic shear conditions.
A mechanistic approach illustrating gemini surfactant-polymer interactions
was also discussed in this study. Surface properties of the polymer
and polymer/surfactant solution were studied using dynamic interfacial
tension (IFT) measurements. Thereafter, emulsification behavior of
surfactant-polymer formulations was studied by a dynamic light scattering
(DLS) technique. Rock-wettability alteration and crude oil miscibility
investigations were investigated with an elapse of time. In summary,
novel chemical fluid systems (HMPA +/ gemini surfactant) were optimized
and developed to prove their efficacy as a suitable EOR chemical fluids.

Results
and Discussion
HMPA Copolymer Characterization
FTIR and 1H NMR Analyses
The FTIR spectrum
of the synthesized HMPA copolymer is depicted in Figure 1. The peaks at 1632 and 3430
cm–1 are assigned to C=O and N–H stretching
vibrations of the −CONH2 group, respectively. These
peak characteristics established the presence of the acrylamide group
in synthesized polymer. Adsorption bands at 2963 and 2925 cm–1 relate to the stretching vibrations of −CH3. Adsorption
bands at 2853 and 1457 cm–1 correspond to the −CH2– bonding on the polymer chain. Peaks showing C=C
bonding on an aromatic ring appear at 1500 and 1457 cm–1. Adsorption bands at 1116 cm–1 show the existence
of −CN stretching. The presence of spectral peak at 616 cm–1 is characteristic of aromatic rings in a compound.
FTIR peaks suggest successful copolymerization of acrylamide and N-phenylacrylamide to form the HMPA copolymer.

Figure 1 FTIR spectrum
of HMPA copolymer.

Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectral data
for hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide
(HMPA). The compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide in deuterated
form (DMSO-d6) as a lock solvent and its
spectral data was recorded in the solution state to identify NMR peaks.
The existence of characteristic signals at chemical shift (δ)
values of 0.81–1.63 ppm relates to methyl −CH2 groups. Peaks located in the NMR region at (δ) 2.06–2.48
ppm are attributed to −CH of acrylamide units present within
a copolymer structure. Evidence showing the carbon–nitrogen
(C–N) bond of an acrylamide functional group is obtained as
a multiplet signal at (δ) 3.00 ppm. It is pertinent to note
that this NMR peak is stronger as compared to the chemical shift of
αH of the CH2–NH2 group, showing
that the carbonyl group acts an electron-withdrawing group (EWG),
that is, it draws the electron away from the reaction center, with
decreased shielding effect. The presence of the phenyl group within
the HMPA molecule is confirmed due to the resonance peak at 7.30 ppm
(δ). Therefore, these results corroborate the formation of the
multiblock copolymer (HMPA) containing long acrylamide chains and
a short sequence of hydrophobic acrylamide/N-phenyl
acrylamide monomeric components.

Gel Permeation Chromatography
The
molecular weight
of the HMPA polymer was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) using universal calibration and HPLC water as an effluent. The
polymer has an average molecular weight (Mw) of 2.098 × 105 Da and polydispersity index (PDI)
of 1.643. Figure 3 shows
molecular weight distribution for the HMPA copolymer.

Figure 3 Molecular weight distribution
of HMPA polymer.

Salt Tolerance
The salt tolerance values of synthesized
copolymer solution at 5000 ppm copolymer concentration at 303 and
343 K are 20 and 25%, respectively. This is performed by gradually
increasing the percentage of salt (NaCl) in aqueous copolymer solution
until precipitation is observed. Salt tolerance is observed to increase
with temperature. This behavior is relevant to many polymer solution
behavior, as solubility of NaCl tends to increase with increasing
temperature.

Effect of HMPA Concentration on Viscosity
The synthesized
HMPA copolymer shows an increase in viscosity with increasing polymer
concentration. Aggregates are formed by strong interchain associations
as copolymer concentration increases. The formation of large polymer
aggregates is evident from dynamic light scattering (DLS) results
of copolymer solutions. With increasing HMPA concentration, the average
size of polymer aggregates is observed to increase due to strong interchain
associations. The average aggregate sizes for HMPA copolymer solutions
containing 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 ppm HMPA are found to
be 410, 558, 725, 898, and 1015 nm, respectively. This confirms the
gradual formation of HMPA-stabilized aggregates within a bulk aqueous
phase. At low polymer dosages, small aggregates are formed with small
hydrodynamic volume due to low extent of intermolecular network structure
formation of constituent polymer chains with one other. With increasing
HMPA concentration in aqueous solution, the hydrophobic intermolecular
associations are more dominated and formed a physical network structure
with large polymer chain aggregates and, subsequently, higher solution
viscosities are achieved.28

Figure 4 shows the effect
of copolymer concentration and temperature on viscosity with varying
shear rates. The solution exhibits decreasing viscosity with increasing
shear rates up to 100 s–1. This shear thinning or
pseudoplastic character of HMPA solution is because of the minimal
effect of colloidal dispersion in the presence of large copolymer
chain molecules. Beyond a critical shear rate, viscosity is observed
to increase slightly showing dilatant or shear thickening character
in an aqueous phase. However, this may be attributed to the effect
of turbulence at a high shear rate. This behavior can be explained
with the help of different phenomena, namely, the order–disorder
transition (ODT) theory, hydrodynamic lubrication theory, and Jamming
theory. According to the ODT theory, a viscosity increase is observed
due to transition of polymer molecules from the ordered to disordered
state with increasing shear rates.29 The
theory of hydrodynamic lubrication states that hydroclusters are formed
above critical shear rates, resulting increased viscosity of copolymer
fluids.30 As per the Jamming theory, frictional
contact occurs between entangled polymer chains at a high shear rate,
leading to shear thickening behavior.31 However, dynamic shear conditions within reservoir do not exceed
100 s–1 even under variable permeability throat
regions and blind ends. Therefore, HMPA copolymer fluids show pseudoplastic
behavior, which is considered as a desirable property of EOR injection
fluids. With increasing temperature, viscosity of HMPA solution is
observed to decrease. This is due to increasing mobility of polymer
chains, which decreases their degree of entanglement. This disrupts
the hydrophobic interactions among polymer (tail) chains and lesser
intermolecular association. This effect is more profound in solutions
containing favorably high polymer concentration where intermolecular
association is dominated.

Figure 4 Effect of copolymer concentration on the viscosity
at 303 and 343
K.

Effect of NaCl Concentration
and Temperature on Polymer Viscosity
To verify the effect
of NaCl content on polymer solution of viscosity,
copolymer solution was prepared with 5000 ppm concentration in distilled
water and then various solutions were prepared at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 15% NaCl concentration. The plots showing solution
viscosity versus the shear rate are shown in Figure 5. Viscosity of solution decreased with increasing
NaCl concentration up to 1%. This is attributed to the presence of
the inefficient (macromolecular) network structure by initial weakening
of hydrophobic associations, which reduces the ionic strength of polymer
fluids. However, this behavior showed a reverse trend when salinity
increased beyond 1% NaCl concentration. Thereafter, increasing salinities
lead to formation of a more pronounced dynamic cross-linking network
structure owing to increased solution polarity.32,33 In Figure 6, the
electrical double layer of the hydration shell around polymer hydrophobic
chains is compressed by salt ions, thus improving the degree of mutual
attraction among polymer surfaces.32−34 Consequently, intermolecular
associations among polymer hydrophobes increase, resulting in electrostatic
shielding of the HMPA polymer. With increasing temperature, intermolecular
association of hydrophobic groups weakens and the degree of entanglement
of hydrophobic groups decreases, leading to viscosity reduction in
copolymer solution.35

on the viscosity at 303 and 343 K.

of salt addition on solution viscosity.

Interfacial and Rheological Behavior of HMPA/Gemini Surfactant
Systems
Surface Tension of Aqueous Solution
Figure 7 shows the surface tension
of HMPA solutions and HMPA/gemini surfactant solutions at 303 K. From Figure 7a, it is observed
that the surface tension of HMPA solution increases with increasing
polymer concentration. This is due to adsorption of polymer molecules
onto air-aqueous interfaces. The hydrophobic tail component in polymer
molecules entangles with one another to form a chain network structure
in the bulk phase as well as adsorb onto air-aqueous interfaces. When
the interface becomes saturated with polymer molecules, the surface
tension is observed to increase.17,18 Surface tension
measurements were conducted to identify the point of critical micelle
concentration (CMC) for the HMPA copolymer system in an aqueous phase.
At 750 ppm, the lowest value of surface tension was obtained due to
complete adsorption of air-aqueous interfaces with polymer molecules.
This concentration limit marks the beginning of the hydrophobic interactions’
effect among polymer chains in the bulk phase due to unavailability
of “vacant sites” for HMPA adsorption. Beyond CMC, hydrodynamic
interaction dominates significantly as a function of copolymer concentration
owing to polymer chain entanglement and subsequent formation of the
network structure.36 Surface tension values
at 303 K were found to be 39.5, 40.9, 42.3, 43.2, and 43.6 mN/m at
varying polymer concentration values of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and
5000 ppm, respectively. Addition of the gemini surfactant in 5000
ppm HMPA solution leads to a marked decrease in surface tension values
as described from Figure 7b plots. Gemini surfactants favorably accommodate onto “vacant
adsorption” sites onto the liquid surface and improve surfactant
adsorption. The lowest surface tension for the HMPA/14-6-14 GS system
was observed at 2000 pm, which is measured as 29.8 mN/m. For the HMPA/SF-6-SF
GS system, a minimum tension value of 27.1 mN/m is obtained at 2000
ppm surfactant concentration. The HMPA/SF-6-SF GS surfactant system
has lower surface tension due to hydrophobic interaction and the absence
of “ionic” repulsion in comparison to HMPA/14-6-14 GS
since 14-6-14 GS surfactant molecules have cationic head groups.

tension of HMPA polymer solution and (b) surface tension
of 5000 ppm HMPA with varying concentrations of 14-6-14 GS and SF-6-SF
GS gemini surfactant at 303 K.

In copolymer solutions, hydrophobic interactions among polymer
chains dominate owing to intramolecular associations. As concentration
of the copolymer is increased, hydrophobic intermolecular associations
are more dominated and formed the physical network structure with
large polymer chain aggregates.28 This
increased the hydrodynamic volume of polymers, and subsequently, higher
solution viscosities are achieved. The presence of phenyl groups within
a copolymer molecular structure induces the van der Waals effect due
to its planar, polarizable structure.20,37 This, in fact,
can improve the stabilization behavior of alkyl chain-involved hydrophobic
interactions, thus enhancing the structural rigidity of the polymer
(macromolecular) network.15 The entanglement
of polymer tail groups occurs because of combined van der Waals and
the hydrophobic association effect among polymer surfaces. Hence,
the viscosity behavior of polymer solutions is a function of concentration
and nature of interacting monomer species.

Viscosity Measurements
In HMPA copolymer solution,
thickening behavior is observed with increasing cationic surfactant
(14-6-14 GS) due to a shear-induced structure in the form of worm-like
micelle structures.38 Viscosity of HMPA/14-6-14
GS solution increases up to a certain concentration of the copolymer
(1500 ppm) in an aqueous phase. This is due to the binding of surfactant
molecules to the hydrophobic junction of HMPA chains to form mixed
micelles. Hydrophobes of HMPA polymer chains are saturated with individual
surfactant micelles, and viscosity begins to decrease due to electrostatic/steric
effects among surfactant micelles. Polymer-surfactant interactions
in aqueous media (displacing phase) are mainly dominated by hydrophobic
interactions, electrostatic repulsion/attraction, and steric effects.39 Above 1500 ppm, viscosity of the mixed solution
system decreases with 14-6-14 GS concentration, indicating one hydrophobe
per micelle and a resulting decrease in interchain interaction due
to repulsion among micelles encapsulated by cationic polar head groups.
In the case of HMPA + SF-6-SF systems, increasing surfactant concentrations
to 500 ppm increased solution viscosity due to interchain cross-linking
phenomena as above. However, a further increase in SF-6-SF concentration
showed a decrease in viscosity. Again, this effect indicates micellar
repulsion due to the steric effect. Figure 8 shows the variation of solution viscosity
with increasing shear rates shown for HMPA + gemini surfactant fluid
systems.35,38,39

shear rate for (a) 5000 ppm HMPA and different
14-6-14 GS concentrations and (b) 5000 ppm HMPA and different SF-6-SF
GS concentrations at 343 K.

Viscoelastic Behavior
Dynamic moduli are plotted as
a function of angular frequency (ω) in Figure 9 for chemical solutions containing 5000 ppm
HMPA copolymer and 5000 ppm HMPA copolymer + SF-6-SF/14-6-14 surfactants.
Crossover frequency is identified at ∼2 rad/s for both HMPA
and HMPA/gemini surfactant systems. Below crossover frequency, G″ is found to be greater than G′. At angular frequencies above 2 rad/s, both HMPA and HMPA/gemini
surfactant systems showed dominant elastic behavior as G′ > G″. In micro/nanoscale reservoirs
wherein polymer and polymer/gemini surfactant solution are injected,
some pores are blocked due to the large size of molecules or micelles
compared to pores. This leads to trapping of residual oil within rock
pores. This shows that they are able to displace oil from small size
pore throats. High viscoelastic behavior shows lesser residual oil
saturation for the synthesized polymer and polymer/surfactant solutions.
Oil displacement from pores may be higher in this type of polymer
and polymer/gemini surfactant system.40 Further studies were performed for 5000 ppm HMPA, {5000 ppm HMPA
+ 2000 ppm 14-6-14}, and {5000 ppm HMPA + 2000 ppm SF-6-SF} solutions
because these solutions showed desirable physicochemical properties
needed for enhanced oil recovery.

Interaction Mechanism of {HMPA + Gemini Surfactant}-Based
Aqueous
Systems
The primary interactions existing between the gemini
surfactant and polymer molecules comprise electrostatic attraction,
hydrophobic forces, and hydrogen bonding. Surfactant addition improves
the adsorption ability of polymer fluids, resulting in an improved
electrostatic effect (in the case of cationic 14-6-14 GS) and multiple
interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions (in the case of nonionic
SF-6-SF GS). Figure 10 shows the interaction mechanisms between HMPA polymer and gemini
surfactant molecules in aqueous solution. It is observed that viscosity
of copolymer solutions increases with increasing concentration. This
suggests the formation of interchain and intrachain aggregates caused
by entanglement of HMPA hydrophobe chains.26,40 However, in gemini surfactant + copolymer-based systems, surfactant
micelles associate with polymer chains described as a “string
of beads model” owing to the improved hydrophobic interaction
effect.25 In the presence of 14-6-14 GS,
cationic head groups enhanced the electrostatic forces existing among
the polymer-surfactant molecule. On the contrary, strong hydrogen
bonding exists between polymer and nonionic SF-6-SF GS molecules.
As a result, the number of charges for polymer chain increases, causing
the polymer chain to further extend and the structure viscosity to
increase.41 This is corroborated by analysis
of viscosity profiles of different polymer solutions in the presence
of the gemini surfactant discussed in Figure 8. A spatial network structure formed by interaction
between GS micelles and polymer chain groups, which is corroborated
by a viscosity increase until a concentration of 2000 ppm 14-6-14
GS or 750 ppm SF-6-SF in solution is reached. This marks that the
adsorption limit of surfactants reaches their saturation and the viscosity
of surfactant-polymer fluids increases to a maximum value. Higher
concentration of gemini surfactants (above adsorption limit) causes
HMPA chains to lose their associative properties and partially curl
within the bulk phase, which is clear from a viscosity decrease in
polymer solution.42

HMPA polymer chains and gemini surfactant molecules in terms of (a)
hydrophobic interactions and (b) electrostatic forces and hydrogen
bonding effect.

Nanoemulsion Characterization
Particle
Size Distribution Studies
Figure 11 shows the intensity-weighted
particle size distribution profile for the nanoemulsion system in
the presence of the polymer, {HMPA +14–6-14}, and {HMPA + SF-6-SF}.
For polymer-stabilized nanoemulsions, large droplet sizes are observed
because of oil droplet coalescing ability. Hydrodynamic diameter values
vary in a range of 10.5–2780.0 nm and the average droplet diameter
is measured as 365.4 nm. For the {HMPA +14–6-14}-based nanoemulsion
system, hydrodynamic diameter varies from 3.77 to 307.6 nm, with an
average value of 144.3 nm. An average droplet diameter of 137.3 nm
was obtained for {HMPA + SF-6-SF} nanoemulsion, wherein hydrodynamic
diameter of dispersed oil droplets varies in a range of 29.4–278.0
nm. This shows that the addition of the gemini surfactant into HMPA
solution reduces the average oil droplet diameter. In summary, surfactant
molecules adsorb onto oil-aqueous interfaces, thus reducing droplet
(dispersion) size in polymer containing fluids.

hydrodynamic diameter of emulsion system
at 303 K.

Zeta Potential Results
In oil-in-water nanoemulsion
systems, oil phases remain dispersed within a continuous aqueous phase.
The stability of oil droplets is mainly dependent on two main influences.
The first effect comprises the steric stabilization effect, wherein
the hydrophilic polymer and/or other emulsifier molecules encapsulate
oil droplets, in such a way that their long chains reach out into
solution. Another influence is electrical repulsive interactions among
surfactant head groups (adsorbed onto droplet surfaces). The zeta
potential versus surfactant concentration plots is depicted in Figure 12. In HMPA solutions,
steric interactions among polymer chains dominate over electrical
forces and zeta potential values are found to be about −2.5
mV. In the presence of SF-6-S GS, potential between oil droplets does
not show a considerable change due to the nonionic nature of surfactant
head groups. However, addition of cationic 14-6-14 GS surfactant molecules
into HMPA polymer-based nanoemulsion systems shows a considerable
increase in surface charge magnitudes in a positive direction. Zeta
potential values are observed to increase to +4.7, +9.4, and +14.6
mV in surfactant-polymer mixtures with 1000, 1500, and 2000 ppm 14-6-14
GS concentrations, respectively. This is attributed to the dominance
of electrostatic repulsion among head groups of surfactants constituting
the electrical double layer (EDL) surrounding dispersed oil droplets.
Increasing temperature showed a slight change in zeta potential readings,
confirming that HMPA solution and HMPA + GS fluids retain their stability
under high-temperature conditions. The introduction of gemini surfactant
+ polymer molecules creates a mechanical barrier (steric + electrical
repulsion) effect around dispersed oil droplets and consequently slows
the rate of oil coalescence.43 Therefore,
{14-6-14 GS + HMPA polymer} systems exhibit better droplet stabilization
behavior in comparison to {SF-6-SF + HMPA} and pure HMPA-stabilized
emulsions.

+ gemini
surfactant}-stabilized oil-in-water nanoemulsion systems.

Crude Oil Miscibility
Miscibility is the property of
two liquids to mix or fully dissolve to form homogeneous solution.
To solubilize trapped oil, a large amount of polymer, polymer/surfactant
slug, and turbulent flow are needed to form in situ emulsion during
surfactant injection. The properties of these emulsion phases are
inexact in terms of miscibility and droplet stability with crude oil,
which are reliant on the salinity and formation fluid conditions.
Thus, to replace the polymer and polymer/surfactant slug with emulsion
slug, it is desirable to optimize emulsion properties for EOR. It
helps to predict the behavior and viability of emulsion in the reservoir.
Crude oil, being an immiscible liquid, is separated from emulsion
after a certain period. The gemini surfactant improves the oil miscibility
of copolymer solutions since it decreases the oil-aqueous IFT. Figure 13 show the miscibility
of crude oil in emulsion with time, after 12 h. The crude oil separated
from the emulsion phase after 18 h for 5000 ppm HMPA solution, {5000
ppm HMPA + 2000 ppm 14-6-14} solution, and {5000 ppm HMPA +2 000 ppm
SF-6-SF}. Therefore, analyzed polymer-surfactant systems exhibit favorable
crude oil miscibility with prepared emulsion slug formulations.44

ppm HMPA,
(b) 5000 ppm HMPA + 2000 ppm 14-6-14 GS, and (c) 5000 ppm HMPA + 2000
ppm SF-6-SF GS at different time intervals.

Interfacial Tension between Oil-Aqueous Solution
IFT
studies are important for assessing the oil recovery ability of chemical
fluids during EOR processes. Figure 14 shows the variation of IFT with an elapse of time.
It is observed that IFT values continuously decrease with time and
gradually achieve a plateau region. The equilibrium values of oil-aqueous
IFT for HMPA, HMPA +14-6-14 GS, and HMPA + SF-6-SF GS solutions are
0.854, 0.148, and 0.034 mN/m, respectively. As compared to HMPA solution,
HMPA/GS systems achieve an early plateau in IFT plots. Interactions
between the hydrophobic group of the HMPA polymer chain and GS molecules
increase with surfactant addition. HMPA + 14-6-14 possesses the cationic
group due to which electrostatic repulsion between polar groups dominates
between molecules at oil-aqueous interfaces.45 This observation indicates that surfactant-polymer mixtures exhibit
better oil displacement ability as compared to polymer fluids owing
to improved interfacial activity at oil-aqueous interfaces.

tension for HMPA and HMPA + gemini surfactant
systems at oil-aqueous interface, obtained by spinning drop technique
at 303 K.

Dynamic Contact Angle Investigations
Wettability characteristic
studies using sessile drop analysis were performed onto quartz and
carbonate rock surfaces at different temperature conditions to study
the oil displacement efficacy. During the oil ageing process, the
rock sample(s) were permitted to saturate with crude oil in a closed
(sealed) environment to simulate oil-saturated reservoir. Using sessile
drop analysis, the contact angle was measured with respect to time
onto a rock surface. Initially, the reservoir rock surface revealed
the intermediate-wet state. From Figure 15, the contact angle gradually decreased
with elapse of time at different rates, depending on the nature of
fluid and rock specimen. The solutions possess the ability to alter
rock wettability to the favorable water-wet state. Wettability alteration
characteristics improve with increasing temperature, as evident from
less time required to reach strongly water-wetting behavior. This
is attributed to greater availability adsorption sites at the oil-aqueous
interface and more effective oil displacing behavior of chemical fluids
onto the oil-saturated rock surface.46

Conclusions
The synthesis and physicochemical properties
of the hydrophobically
modified water-soluble acrylamide/N-phenylacrlamide
copolymer (HMPA) were studied for application as chemical displacing
fluid in EOR processes. FTIR and 1H NMR spectra of the
synthesized polymer showed the incorporation of N-phenylacrylamide monomer (repeating) units in addition to repeating
acrylamide polymer chains. Molecular weight determined by the gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) method was found to be 2.098 ×
105 g/mol. The synthesized copolymer demonstrated relatively
high salt tolerance, which is typical for the nonionic polymers. The
copolymer showed favorable pseudoplastic or shear-thinning behavior.
Addition of the gemini surfactant into polymer solution showed an
initial increase in solution viscosity due to the binding of cross-linking
polymer chains with surfactant molecules to form mixed micelles. After
a certain concentration limit is reached, the electrostatic/steric
effects among surfactant micelles dominate and the degree of the cross-linking
network starts decreasing, leading to reduced viscosity of polymer-surfactant
fluids. These observed properties of pseudoplasticity, salt tolerance,
encouraging viscosity/viscoelasticity, and temperature profiles are
attractive features of the hydrophobic copolymer, which show potential
in EOR processes. Surface tensions of HMPA, HMPA + 2000 ppm 14-6-14
GS, and HMPA + SF-6-SF GS were found to be 43.6, 29.8, and 27.1 mN/m,
respectively. Oil-aqueous IFT values for HMPA polymer solution were
measured as 0.854 mN/m, which decrease to 0.148 mN/m with 14-6-14
GS addition and 0.034 mN/m in the presence of SF-6-SF GS. Dynamic
light scattering results showed the formation of small oil droplets
with average size in a range of 100–200 nm. Zeta potential
studies showed that 14-6-14 GS + HMPA emulsions exhibit enhanced stability
as compared to other analyzed systems. HMPA + gemini surfactant fluids
also exhibited favorable emulsification behavior in the presence of
crude oil. Reduction in interfacial tension values of HMPA polymer
solution was achieved by addition of the gemini surfactant due to
increased hydrophobic interactions between polymer and gemini surfactant
molecules. Surfactant-polymer combinations showed rock-wetting characteristics,
showing their abilities to displace residual oil deposited onto reservoir
rock surfaces. In summary, both HMPA copolymer and HMPA + gemini surfactant
mixtures revealed favorable physicochemical traits as potential oil
recovery agents.

Experimental Section
Materials
Acrylamide
(≥98.5%) was used as supplied
by Avantor Performance Materials India Ltd. N-Phenylacrylamide
(99%) was obtained by Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium persulfate (≥99%)
and n-hexane CTAB (hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide)
(≥99%) were purchased by Sigma-Aldrich. Cationic gemini surfactant N,N′-bis(dimethyltetradecyl)-1,6-hexanediammonium
bromide (14-6-14 GS) and nonionic gemini surfactant bis(monoglyceride-1-hydroxymethyl-2-fattyacidester)-1,6-hexanediether
(SF-6-SF GS) were synthesized in the laboratory as per the previously
reported method.47,48 Distilled water was obtained
from a double distillation apparatus. Crude oil (API gravity of 23.55°)
was obtained from ONGC field, Ahmedabad Asset, India.

Characterization
of Gemini Surfactants
The infrared
spectra of gemini surfactants were studied with a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum
2 IR spectrometer. The synthesized gemini surfactants were milled
in KBr in a concentration range of ≤2.0% to obtain a fine powder.
This powder is then compressed to form a thin pellet that is used
for FTIR analysis. TGA of the synthesized gemini was studied with
the help of Diamond thermogravimetric/differential analyzer (Perkin-Elmer,
USA) in an argon (Ar) atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 K/min.

Cationic
Gemini Surfactant, N,N′-Bis(dimethyltetradecyl)-α,ω-alkanediammonium
Bromide (14-6-14 GS)
The characteristic infrared bands showing
the presence of different functional groups are depicted in Figure 16a. Adsorption peaks
at 2920 and 2852 cm–1 show the presence of symmetrical
and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of alkanes at terminal −CH3 groups. Asymmetrical bending vibrations of the −CH–
group are displayed by bands at 1470 cm–1. The existence
of peaks at 1270 and 1179 cm–1 confirms C–N
stretching from the polar head groups. R4N+ stretching
vibrations, which exhibit the presence of quaternary amine groups,
are identified from peaks at 1081 cm–1. The peak
at 721 cm–1 corresponds to the weak intensity of
(CH2)6 rocking vibrations in the spacer. Therefore, FTIR
analysis show that the chemical compounds under analysis consist of
two hydrophobic tail groups and two head groups connected by a spacer
chain, that is, a gemini surfactant.

for cationic 14-6-14 GS.
(b) Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of synthesized nonionic 14-6-14
GS in the temperature range of 298 to 573 K.

Thermal degradation zones are identified in Figure 16b to investigate weight losses occurring
with increasing temperature. The first stage of thermal degradation
(∼0.35%) is due to breakdown of weakly bonded water molecules,
resulting in the removal of moisture in the specimens. Thereafter,
the second weight loss (additional 30.78%) occurs at a higher temperature
range (448–523 K), indicating complex thermal decomposition
of surfactant molecules, beginning from alkyl tail chains. Thus, 14-6-14
GS has the ability to retain its structural integrity under subsurface
conditions.

Nonionic Gemini Surfactant, Bis(monoglyceride-1-hydroxymethyl-2-fattyacidester)-α,ω-alkanediether
(SF-6-SF GS)
Analysis of infrared spectra of the nonionic
SF-6-SF GS was performed to identify peak regions corresponding to
various functional groups, as depicted in Figure 17a. Two sharp adsorption bands were obtained
at 3420 and 3386 cm–1, showing the existence of
−OH bonds. Peaks at 2918 and 2851 cm–1 account
for the symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching vibrations,
respectively. The existence of O—C=O and C=O
bonds in ester groups in the compound is evident from stretching vibrations
identified by the presence of peaks near 1659 and 1731 cm–1. A single peak near 1462 cm–1 is indicative of
alkane C–H bending vibrations. A single peak located at 719
cm–1 shows the rocking vibrations of the (CH2)6 spacer present in the ester compound. In addition,
peaks in the region of 1145 and 1075 cm–1 correspond
to C–O stretching vibrations of ether groups attached to either
sides of the aliphatic spacer chain. Thus, it is confirmed that the
synthesized compound is a gemini surfactant consisting of two alkyl
chains (tails) with ester and ether groups, which are connected by
an aliphatic spacer.

oil.
(b) Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of synthesized nonionic SF-6-SF
GS in the temperature range of 298 to 573 K.

Figure 17b shows
the thermal loss curves of the SF-6-SF-based gemini surfactant. The
first stage of degradation starts at 373 K, showing the loss of intramolecular
hydroxyl (−OH) groups with a weight loss of ∼3.37%.
The second degradation stage (additional 13.38%) is observed at a
temperature of 448 K due to the initial decomposition of ester groups
and subsequent destruction of fatty acid chain groups until 518 K.
Hence, SF-6-SF GS is capable of maintaining its stability within the
temperature range of petroleum reservoir.

The above discussions
comprise the chemical and thermal characterization
properties of cationic gemini surfactant (14-6-14 GS) and nonionic
gemini surfactant (SF-6-SF GS). The data have already been reported
and discussed in our previous articles.47,48 Their CMC
values are very low, confirming their self-aggregation ability at
low temperatures. The CMC value of 14-6-14 GS (cationic surfactant)
is 160 ppm (0.22 mmol/L), whereas the CMC of the SF-6-SF surfactant
is 200 ppm (0.24 mmol/L) in aqueous solution. In this article, surfactant
concentrations in a range of 500–3000 ppm are selected in mixed
polymer-surfactant systems in this study to ensure the formation of
surfactant micelles in the bulk phase and optimize interfacial and
rheological properties for EOR application.

Synthesis of
HMPA Copolymer
The acrylamide/N-phenylacrylamide-based
copolymer was prepared in the laboratory.
Initially, aqueous solution containing 20 wt % acrylamide monomer
was mixed in an R.B. three-neck flask. After solubilization of acrylamide
in water, CTAB (8 g) was added into the solution, followed by 0.423
g of N-phenylacrylamide (2 mol %). Then, it was allowed
to stir until a clear solution was achieved. Thereafter, potassium
persulfate (0.0036 g) was added into the mixture and the temperature
was increased to 323 K for polymerization to occur for 8 h. The reaction
was performed under a nitrogen (N2) environment. The obtained
liquid was allowed to cool at room temperature and then extracted
by precipitation onto continuously stirred methanol (1 L). The precipitated
polymer was filtered out, dissolved in water, and again reprecipitated
in methanol (1 L). This process was performed four times to remove
CTAB from the final product. Then, the polymer was dried under vacuum
at 328–338 K to obtain the HMPA copolymer. Figure 18 shows the chemical reaction
for the synthesis of acrylamide/N-phenylacrylamide
to form the hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide (HMPA) copolymer.

Figure 18 Reaction
scheme for synthesis of HMPA copolymer.

HMPA Characterization
Chemical Analysis
FTIR of the polymer
compound was
performed using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 2 spectrophotometer using
potassium bromide (KBr) pellet in a wavenumber range of 4000–400
cm–1. Chemical characterization by proton nuclear
magnetic resonance of the synthesized HMPA copolymer was performed
with the help of a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Polymer
molecular weight was studied by a multiangle light scattering spectrophotometer
by BI-MwA, Brookhaven Instruments. Polymer solution was prepared in
HPLC grade water using 3020 ppm polymer concentration. Aqueous copolymer
solution was tested to check its tolerance in the presence of salt
ions. Salt tolerance studies were carried out at 303 and 343 K and
solution was visually inspected for formation of precipitates. The
viscosity of the polymer solution is measured at different shear rates
using a Bohlin Gemini rheometer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., U.K.) under
influences of temperature and salinity.

Physicochemical Evaluation
of HMPA + Gemini Surfactant Fluids
Surface Tension Measurement
The Du Noüy ring
method employed in a tensiometer to measure surface tension at the
air-aqueous interface at 303 K. Initially, experiments were conducted
with varying polymer concentrations. Thereafter, polymer-gemini surfactant
mixtures were prepared with varying 14-6-14 GS concentrations at constant
polymer concentration (5000 ppm).

Rheological Studies
Viscosity of copolymer nanoemulsion
fluids was studied as a function of varying shear rates using a cup
and bob measuring system using a Bohlin Gemini rheometer. The viscoelastic
properties of copolymer solutions (containing 5000 ppm HMPA) with
varying NaCl concentrations were determined at 343 K using the same
instrument. At first, to find the strain value, the amplitude sweep
was performed on solution and then at constant strain value, frequency
sweep tests were performed. G′ (elastic modulus)
and G″ (viscous modulus) indicate elastic
energy stored within the fluid and energy required to initiate the
flow, respectively.

Nanoemulsion Preparation and Characterization
High-Energy
Synthesis
Nanoemulsion consists of n-heptane
(oil) cores, stabilized by the {polymer (HMPA)
+ gemini surfactant (14-6-14 GS/SF-6-SF GS)} shell and dispersed in
an aqueous phase. The high-energy method was used to prepare emulsion.
Emulsion was prepared by mixing a solution containing 90% (v/v) aqueous
solution and 10% (v/v) n-heptane (oil) using a magnetic
stir bar for 10 min at 1000 rpm. Afterward, a Hielscher UP200Ht ultrasonic
homogenizer (200 W, 26 kHz) was used to prepare emulsion by ultrasonication.
The stability of formed emulsions was observed as a function of polymer/surfactant
composition and time.

Nanoemulsion (Oil) Droplet Analyses: DLS
and Zeta Potential
Emulsions were characterized using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano S90
instrument at 303 K. Refractive indices and absorbance were determined
by a Refracto 30PX meter and UV-1800 spectrophotometer for dynamic
light scattering (DLS) input data, respectively. Emulsion samples
were analyzed in an Omega cuvette to determine zeta potential among
dispersed oil droplets in an Anton Paar LiteSizer 500 instrument.

Miscibility Experiments
To test crude oil miscibility
of copolymer and copolymer/gemini surfactant solution, crude oil and
prepared polymer or polymer/gemini surfactant solution (1:1 ratio)
were poured into test tubes and mixed for a period of 12 h. The total
mixture volume was 20 mL. The two liquid mixed by a Rivotek horizontal
shaker. The miscibility time of crude oil in solution signifies a
relative measure of the fluid’s enhanced oil extraction ability.
The miscibility of liquids was determined optically (visual observation).

IFT Measurement
Interfacial tension between crude oil
and aqueous solution of polymer or polymer-surfactant solutions was
measured by a spinning drop SVT 20 tensiometer. To measure IFT, prepared
solution was loaded into a glass tube followed by injection of crude
oil. After that, the glass tube was placed in a tensiometer and rotated
at 3500 rpm. The IFT value was measured by profile fitting of oil
drop within a continuous aqueous solution phase.

Contact Angle
Measurements
The drop shape analyzer
(DSA25, Kruss, Germany) was used to measure the dynamic contact angle
between polymer, polymer/gemini surfactant solutions, and quartz and
carbonate rock surfaces to evaluate their wettability alteration characteristics.
In this experiment, precisely measured 10 μL solution was dropped
onto the top of quartz and carbonate rock surfaces. After that, variation
in the contact angle was recorded by a video/photographic zoom camera.
Then, in-built KRUSS software was used to perform further analyses.
