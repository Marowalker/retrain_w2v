Combating
bacterial pathogens has become a global concern, especially
the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria have made conventional antibiotics
lose their efficiency. This grim situation suggests the necessity
to explore novel antibacterial agents with favorable safety and strong
antibacterial activity. Here, we took the advantage of quaternary
ammonium compounds and synthesized a long-chain high-molecular organic
bis-quaternary ammonium salt (BQAS) with a broad-spectrum bactericidal
activity through a facile one-pot reaction. The bactericidal effect
of BQAS was evaluated by two bacterial human pathogens: Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), which are
the major cause of diarrheal infections in children and adults. Our
experimental results indicate that the bactericidal activity of BQAS
is linked to the strong contact between the positively charged quaternary
ammonium groups and the bacterial cells, thus leading to a temporary
and locally high concentration of reactive oxygen species, which subsequently
triggers oxidative stress and membrane damage in the bacteria. This
mechanism was further confirmed by several assays, such as the membrane
permeabilization assay, fluorescent-based cell live/dead test, scanning
electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, together with
the lactate dehydrogenase release assay, which all indicated that
BQAS induced damage to the cytoplasmic membrane and the leakage of
intracellular fluid containing essential molecules. The excellent
bactericidal activity of BQAS suggests its great application potential
as a promising candidate against the rapid emergence of drug-resistant
bacterial pathogens.

Introduction
Over the past decades,
infectious diseases caused by bacteria remain
one of the largest health problems in the world1 and afflict millions of people annually2 and thus have gained extensive concerns. More than 1.3
million deaths of children are reported to be caused by diarrheal
illness worldwide every year,3 indicating
the urgent necessity to develop new antibacterial agents with favorable
safety and potent antibacterial activity. To this end, a variety of
antibacterial materials, such as antibiotics,4 antimicrobial peptides,5 cationic polymers,6 carbon-based nanomaterials,7−9 small molecular
antibacterial agents,10−13 and metals or metal oxides14−16 have been widely used in antimicrobial
research. Among these traditional methods, the use of antibiotics
is the most common and effective approach to treat bacterial infectious
diseases.17 Despite the critical role of
antibiotics in decreasing the morbidity and mortality induced by bacterial
infections,18 the global abuse of antibiotics
results in the development of more and more bacteria into resistance
against most of the traditional antibiotics.19 The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses a new threat
to human health,20−22 further suggesting the vital importance of discovering
new antibacterial materials to replace traditional antibiotics.23,24

Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), which are usually white
and
crystalline powders and are very soluble or dispersible in water,
have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and often display
extended biological activity owing to their long-lived residues on
treated surfaces.25 QACs have good antibacterial
activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at
medium concentrations and also possess moderate effectiveness against
viruses, fungi, and algae.26,27 Because of the broad-spectrum
antimicrobial activity and surfactant properties, QACs, such as benzalkonium
chloride, favor hygienic adjuncts in disinfectant cleaners and have
been increasingly used in domestic cleaning products over the last
decade.28 Several mechanisms have been
suggested to explain the antimicrobial action of QACs, such as the
perturbation of cytoplasmic and outer membrane lipid bilayers through
the association of the positively charged quaternary nitrogen with
the polar head groups of acidic phospholipids,29 followed by the interaction of the hydrophobic tail with
the hydrophobic membrane core. QACs usually contain four organic groups
linked to nitrogen, which may be similar or different in chemistry
and structure. The organic substituents are alkyl, aryl, or heterocyclic.
To achieve a hydrophobic segment compatible with the bilayer of the
outer cell wall, at least one of the organic substituents should be
a long alkyl chain.30,31 Previous studies have demonstrated
that with an increasing alkyl chain length of an amphiphilic compound,
the hydrophobic interaction with the lipid bilayer of the cell wall
significantly increases, which in turn enhances the antimicrobial
activity of the compound.32

In this
article, we synthesized a long-chain high-molecular organic
bisquaternary ammonium salt (BQAS) with excellent solubility in water
by using a simple one-pot method. BQAS was found to possess both a
positive charge and a hydrophobic segment, and its bactericidal properties
were investigated by evaluating its bactericidal activity against
the Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli). The results showed that BQAS has a much stronger ability to kill
bacteria at low concentrations, and the Gram-positive S. aureus are more sensitive to BQAS than the Gram-negative E. coli. The bactericidal mechanism of BQAS was also
proposed, and it had the potential as a new broad-spectrum antibacterial
agent for treating infectious diseases.

Results and Discussion
In this study, a simple one-step method was used to synthesize
BQAS with a high yield (90%) and a highly positive surface charge
(ζ-potential ca. +30.2 mV). The molecular structure of BQAS
was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The FT-IR spectra of BQAS (Figure 1A) showed the absorption
bands at 3390 cm–1 (O–H stretching), 2924,
2855 cm–1 (C–H stretching), 1468 cm–1 (C–H bending), 1124 cm–1 (C–N stretching),
1072 cm–1 (C–O stretching), and 721 cm–1 (C–H rocking). The FT-IR spectra matched well
with the molecular structure of BQAS. The 1H NMR spectrum
is shown in Figure 1B, and the peaks at δ5.16 (1-H), δ3.60–4.40 (2-H),
δ3.40 (3-H), δ3.50 (4-H), δ1.80 (5-H), δ1.30
(6-H), and δ0.88 (6-H) demonstrated that BQAS was successfully
synthesized under the one-step pathway. The molecular characterizations
of BQAS were further consolidated by electrospray ionization-mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) (positive ion). The results are shown in Figure S1. Important peaks in these spectra are
found at m/z 519.65, 483.60. These
ion peaks account for the direct loss of one/two chloride ions from
the molecule, leading to the formation of the positively charged ions
(M–Cl)+/(M–2Cl)+. These results
suggested that BQAS was successfully synthesized.

by FT-IR spectroscopy (A) and 1H NMR (B).

The antibacterial effect was quantitatively investigated
by measuring
the growth curves and death rate of bacteria exposed to BQAS. The
growth curve was used to study the dynamics of bacterial growth and
evaluate the antibacterial properties of BQAS at different concentrations
(Figure 2). In Figure 2A,B, an obvious growth
delay could be observed with increasing BQAS concentration, indicating
that the antibacterial activity of BQAS was dose-dependent. In addition,
the growth delay was much more obvious in Figure 2B than in Figure 2A, suggesting that S. aureus is more sensitive to BQAS than E. coli. Apart from growth inhibition, microbicidal activity is an important
indicator for antibacterial materials. The colony count assay was
carried out to study the bactericidal effect of BQAS. Figure 2C,D showed the typical photographs
of the E. coli and S.
aureus bacterial colonies after treatment with various
concentrations of BQAS. The number of colonies was significantly reduced
with an increasing BQAS concentration, indicating that BQAS has excellent
bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative E.
coli and Gram-positive S. aureus bacteria in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, we have
selected two other strains of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (1213P46B; 011P6B5A) and E. coli (EIEC 23-6; EAEC 36) to evaluate the minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the BQAS compounds. The MIC results,
as shown in Table 1 suggested that BQAS had good antibacterial effect against the Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria.

of BQAS.

The death rates also
showed that BQAS has an excellent bactericidal
activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In Figure 3, the death rates
gradually ascended with an increasing concentration of BQAS. The death
rates for E. coli and S. aureus were 35.91 and 36.48% at the concentration
of 12.5 μg/mL, and 84.02 and 94.93% at the concentration of
25 μg/mL, respectively. The bacterial inhibition of BQAS reached
over 99% at the concentration of 50 μg/mL, and with the concentration
of BQAS increased from 12.5 to 200 μg/mL, the death rates of
both E. coli and S.
aureus increased to 99.99%. A comparison of antibacterial
activity between BQAS and CTAB was performed under the same experimental
conditions. Figure 3 showed the death rates of E. coli and S. aureus treated with CTAB (12.5–200
μg/mL). A significant difference of antibacterial effect could
be observed between CTAB and BQAS at low concentrations. For example,
BQAS showed 74 and 94.93% inactivation effect on E.
coli and S. aureus at
a concentration of 25 μg/mL, respectively. However, CTAB exhibited
only about 55.2 and 50.46% inactivation effect on the two strains
at the same concentration (Figure 3). The results indicated that BQAS had a higher antibacterial
activity than CTAB at low concentrations. Additionally, BQAS displayed
a stronger inhibition effect on S. aureus than E. coli at low concentrations.

rates of (A) E. coli and
(B) S. aureus after incubation with
BQAS and CTAB dispersions at different concentrations (0–200
μg/mL) for 3 h at 30 °C. E. coli and S. aureus untreated with BQAS
or CTAB were used as control. Error bars represent the standard deviation.

The credibility of the cfu method
was further confirmed by the
live/dead bacterial staining assay. PI (propidium iodide) and DAPI
(4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) are fluorescent dyes. PI can
only pass through the damaged structures of the cell membrane, stain
the nucleus, and emit red fluorescence, whereas DAPI can penetrate
the intact membrane of live cells, combine strongly with DNA, and
emit blue fluorescence. Therefore, PI and DAPI are usually used to
identify dead cells and live cells,31 respectively.
As shown in Figure 4, the red fluorescence became gradually strong and the blue fluorescence
became weak with the increasing concentration of BQAS, suggesting
that the dead bacterial cells ascended with the increasing concentration
of BQAS. The result was not only in accordance with the above results,
but also implied that the cell membranes were seriously damaged.

panel) and S. aureus (bottom

concentrations of (A) 0, (B) 12.5, (C) 25, (D) 50, (E) 100, and (F)
200 μg/mL, respectively.

The morphological changes and membrane integrity of E. coli and S. aureus bacterial cells treated with BQAS were observed using a scanning
electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. As shown
in Figure 5A,C, in
the absence of BQAS, the shapes of both E. coli and S. aureus cells were typically
rod-shaped and round, respectively, with a smooth and intact cell
wall to protect the bacterial cells and maintain their life.33 However, after treatment with 200 μg/mL
BQAS, significant changes can be observed in the bacterial morphology.
As shown in Figure 5B,D, a large number of E. coli and S. aureus cell walls crumpled and collapsed into
holes and debris (the magnified images showed a rather clear change),
leading to the inactivity of the bacterial cells.

Figure 5 SEM images of E. coli (A,B) and S. aureus (C,D), untreated with BQAS (A,C) and treated
with BQAS (B,D). A 200 μL of BQAS (200 μg/mL) was incubated
with 200 μL of bacterial dispersion (108 cfu/mL)
for 3 h at a shaking speed of 120 rpm at 30 °C.

In addition, the membrane disruption and the inner
changes of the
cells were confirmed by TEM (Figure 6). When the cells were treated with 200 μg/mL
of BQAS, the bacterial cells of E. coli (Figure 6B) and S. aureus (Figure 6D) showed significant changes in morphology compared
with the untreated bacterial cells, with the treated bacterial cell
walls being blurred or the edges partially dissolved, similar to previous
reports.34 These results further indicated
that BQAS was an effective antibacterial agent.

Figure 6 TEM images of E. coli (A,B) and S. aureus (C,D), untreated with BQAS (A,C) and treated
with BQAS (B,D). A 200 μL of BQAS (200 μL/mL) was incubated
with 200 μL of bacterial dispersion (108 cfu/mL)
for 3 h at a shaking speed of 120 rpm at 30 °C.

The significant morphological changes in the structure
of bacterial
cells could be attributed to the detachment of the cytoplasmic membrane
from the cell wall, as determined by the lactic acid dehydrogenase
(LDH) release assay. Figure 7A exhibited the LDH activity in the supernatant after treatment
with BQAS for 3 h. It can be observed that the release of LDH was
concentration-dependent. The bacterial cells treated with 12.5 μg/mL
of BQAS showed a minimal release of LDH. However, when the concentration
of BQAS was increased to 200 μg/mL, the LDH release significantly
ascended, with a cytotoxicity of 84.2 and 83.77% for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively.

Figure 7 (A) BQAS cytotoxicity measured by the LDH release from
the bacterial
cells after treatment with different concentrations (0–200
μg/mL) of BQAS for 3 h. (B) Release of protein from bacteria
treated with BQAS (0–200 μg/mL). Bacterial cells (108 cfu/mL) incubated with 200 μL of different concentrations
(0–200 μg/mL) of BQAS at 30 °C for 3 h at a shaking
speed of 120 rpm. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3).

The release of cytoplasmatic
content was further detected in terms
of DNA and protein (Figures S4 and 7B). It can be clearly seen that after incubation
with different concentrations of BQAS, strips appeared. Interestingly,
the intensity of the strips varied obviously with the different BQAS
concentrations, the intensity of the DNA strips being stronger at
low concentrations than at high concentrations. The results not only
indicated that the DNA was degraded to a certain degree at a high
BQAS concentration because the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS)
had an activity of oxidizing the nucleic acid,35 but also confirmed that the cell membrane of the bacteria
was indeed damaged.

Figure 7B showed
the leakage of proteins after interaction with BQAS. The absorbance
at an optical density of 590 nm (OD590nm) reflected the
level of the leaked proteins. Compared with the group untreated with
BQAS, the values of OD590nm of the treatment groups increased
with the increasing concentration of BQAS, indicating that the leakage
of protein was dose-dependent. The significant increase of the leaked
proteins in the bacteria verified that the bacterial cell membrane
was severely damaged because of the direct contact of the bacteria
with BQAS. The above results fully demonstrated that the bacterial
cell walls were damaged and the inner contents leaked out, eventually
leading to the inhibition of the bacterial growth.

The above
results are consistent with previous studies reporting
that several nanomaterials exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity
against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria.34,36 This difference in sensitivity to nanomaterials can be attributed
to their different cell wall structures.37,38 The cellular membranes of Gram-negative E. coli have negative charges, with pI (isoelectric point) = 4–5.
However, the pI value of Gram-positive S. aureus membranes is higher than that of E. coli, which can generate a more negatively charged surface in a culture
medium at pH 7 (Figure S3). BQAS has a
highly positive surface charge (ζ-potential ca. +30.2 mV) and
can induce a stronger contact with S. aureus. Previous findings have indicated that the highly positive charge
causes a severe disruption of the bacterial membrane.39 To understand the mechanism of reversible antibacterial
control, zeta potential measurements were carried out to study the
interaction between bacteria and BQAS. As shown in Figure 8, the potentials of BQAS exhibited
remarkable changes with the addition of BSA. Previous reports have
shown that cationic conjugated oligomers/polymers with QA groups as
side chains could bind and insert into the negatively charged membrane
of bacteria by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.40,41 Inserting into the membrane by hydrophobic interactions does not
affect the zeta potential of bacteria, but binding by electrostatic
interactions leads to a remarkable positive potential shift. We further
measured the ζ-potential and examined the antibacterial activity
of BQAS. As shown in Figure 8A, the ζ-potential values of BQAS and BQAS–BSA
are significantly different; the ζ-potential values of BQAS
containing 1 and 5 μM BSA are ca. +10 and +3 mV, respectively.
A 12.5 μg/mL BQAS was used to compare the antibacterial properties
of BQAS with BQAS–BSA, and the results are presented in Figure 8B. Further, the MICs
of BQAS and BSA-modified BQAS against S. aureus and E. coli were also measured (Table 2). It can be seen
that the antibacterial activity significantly decreased with the addition
of BSA, suggesting that BQAS rich in positive charge favors its antibacterial
activity, leading to a strong electrostatic interaction with the bacterial
membrane, and then caused severe damage to the integrity of the cell
membrane, induced the leakage of intracellular contents, and ultimately
resulted in bacterial death.

Several previous studies have proposed that
ROS contributed to
the antibacterial activity of many materials.34,35,42,43 Oxidative
stress occurs when cells are exposed to elevated levels of ROS such
as free radicals, •O2–, •OH, and H2O2. Figure 9 shows the electron
spin resonance (ESR) spectra of ROS generated by BQAS in the absence
of bacteria. BQAS generated both •OH (Figure 9A) and •O2– (Figure 9B) signals, with •O2– as the main species.

Figure 9 ESR spectra of (A) DMPO-•OH and (B) DMPO-•O2– for BQAS.

ROS was measured with
an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe
2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). The ROS level is correlated
with the antibacterial activity of the material because of its damaging
effect on the bacterial cell membrane. When the materials affect the
cell membrane, ROS is formed, and DCFH-DA inside the cell reacts with
the ROS to form a fluorescent by-product. As displayed in Figure 10A,D, almost no
green fluorescence was observed in the absence of BQAS. However, in Figure 10B,C,E,F, the green
fluorescence intensity became stronger with the increasing concentration
of BQAS, demonstrating an increase of the endogenous oxidative level
in this study.44 As shown in Figure S5, little green fluorescence could be
observed in the absence of BQAS, implying that almost no ROS was produced.
In contrast, under the treatment of 200 μg/mL BQAS, the green
fluorescence intensity was 5.5 and 4.1 times greater than that of
the control group.

Figure 10 Intracellular ROS staining results of E.
coli (A–C) and S. aureus (D–F)
bacterial cells after treatment with (A) 0, (B) 50, and (C) 200 μg/mL
of BQAS, respectively. Bacterial suspensions in deionized water without
BQAS were used as control.

The peroxidation environment makes a contribution to the
physiological
changes of bacterial cells, such as the depolarization of cell membrane
and the release of protein and DNA/RNA, which result from the permeability
increase of the membrane.45 To identify
whether the cellular oxidative stress is induced by BQAS, the ROS-dependent
oxidative stress was investigated. The production of superoxide anion
(•O2–) at different
BQAS concentrations was monitored using the Superoxide Assay Kit (Beyotime
Biotechnology). As shown in Figure S6,
the absorption values increased notably with an increasing BQAS concentration,
revealing that BQAS mediated superoxide anion production, which played
an important role in antibacterial activity.

Good cell compatibility
is essential for the antibacterial agents
to be used in vivo. The effect of BQAS on the viability of 4T1 cells
was evaluated by employing an MTT cytotoxicity assay. As shown in Figure S7, compared with the control, BQAS displayed
no obvious effect on the proliferation of 4T1 cells within the concentration
of 50 μg/mL, which means that BQAS had a negligible toxicity
to cells and that the cell viability was about 90%. The result indicated
that BQAS could be safely used in vivo.

Conclusions
In
summary, our studies indicated that BQAS exhibited a broad bactericidal
activity against both Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus in vitro,
and the bactericidal activity was concentration-dependent and superior
to that of CTAB. Meanwhile, S. aureus was found to be more sensitive to BQAS than E. coli because of the different cell wall structures. BQAS has a highly
positive surface charge (ζ-potential ca. +30.2 mV) and can induce
a strong contact with the bacterial membrane. The leakage of the inner
cell contents indicated that the exposure of bacteria to BQAS leads
to ROS generation and the destruction of the cell membrane. This study
demonstrated that the combination of a highly positive charge and
ROS generation is an effective approach to improve the antibacterial
activity of a bactericidal material. The integrated data indicated
that BQAS had a great potential for therapy against bacterial infections.

Experimental
Section
Materials
1,3-Dichloro-2-propanol, N,N-dimethyldodecylamine, propanol, ethylacetate,
PI, and DAPI products were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation
(Shanghai, China). The superoxide detection kit and reactive oxygen
test kit were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).
The cytotoxicity detection kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science
(Shanghai, China).

Synthesis and Characterization of BQAS
BQAS was synthesized
by a one-step pathway with 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol and N,N-dimethyldodecylamine by using the condensate
reflow device only.25,46 The molecular structure of BQAS
was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy and MS, and zeta potential
was also used to analyze the obtained BQAS.

Bacterial Culture
E. coli (AB 93154) and S. aureus (AB 91093)
were selected as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively,
and acquired from China Center for Type Culture Collection. All the
bacterial strains were stored at −80 °C in Luria Bertani
(LB) with 30% glycerol. The bacteria were cultured in an LB broth
medium (10 g L–1 peptone, 5 g L–1 yeast extract, 10 g L–1 NaCl, sterilization for
20 min at 121 °C and 101 kPa, and stored at 4 °C for further
use) at 30 °C on a shaker bed at 120 rpm overnight. Then, the
bacterial suspension was washed twice with deionized water by centrifugation
(3000 rpm, 5 min), followed by dilution with deionized water to a
concentration of 108 cfu/mL for further experiments.

Antimicrobial Activity Test of BQAS
The antimicrobial
activity of BQAS was evaluated by measuring OD and by the colony count
method. The OD growth curves were obtained as follows. Briefly, the
logarithmic-phase bacteria (0.2 mL 1 × 108 cfu/mL)
were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and washed in deionized water,
followed by discarding the supernatant. Then, the precipitates were
mixed separately with different concentrations of the BQAS aqueous
solution (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL), and sterile water
was used instead of BQAS as the control group. Next, the mixtures
were subjected to continuous shaking at 120 rpm and 30 °C for
3 h and then transferred to a 20 mL LB medium for further incubation
at 30 °C in a constant-temperature oscillator under 120 rpm rotation.
Finally, aliquots of the samples were withdrawn at 1 hour interval,
and the value of OD at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) was
measured on a Multiskan Spectrum.

The colony count method was
adopted as follows. Briefly, the bacteria (1 × 108 cfu/mL) were incubated with different concentrations of BQAS at
30 °C for 3 h. The aliquots of the samples were withdrawn, and
cfu was counted by plating 20 μL of 10-fold serial dilutions
onto LB agar plates and cultured at 30 °C for 24 h. The control
group consisted of the bacteria untreated with BQAS. The colonies
were counted, and the bacterial death rate was calculated according
to the following formula 1  

Fluorescence
Microscopic Observation (Live/Dead)
The
death rates were further verified via the live/dead viability assay
after treatment with BQAS. Briefly, 200 μL bacterial suspensions
were mixed with 200 μL BQAS at different concentrations (0,
12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL) and incubated in a rotary
shaker at 120 rpm for 3 h at 30 °C. Then, an appropriate volume
of the bacterial suspension was stained with PI and DAPI for 20 and
3 min in the dark sequentially. Finally, the fluorescence images were
taken on a fluorescence microscope.

Cell Morphology Observation
SEM and TEM analyses were
performed to evaluate the effect of BQAS on the morphology and structure
of cells. SEM imaging was conducted as follows. Briefly, the bacterial
cells were incubated with BQAS, followed by washing twice with sterile
water. Then, fixation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 4 h at room temperature
and successive dehydration with a gradient concentration of ethanol
(30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%) for 15 min were performed. Finally, the
samples were dried in a vacuum oven and then coated with gold via
sputtering for SEM, and the samples were dropped on copper grids for
TEM.

Lactase Dehydrogenase Release Experiments
The LDH release
assay was performed to verify the cell membrane activity of bacterial
cells treated with BQAS using the LDH cytotoxicity assay kit (Roche
Applied Science).47 The standard protocol
assay was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, the E. coli and S. aureus cells were treated with BQAS at concentrations
of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL for 3 h, followed by transferring
120 μL of each cell culture supernatant into a new centrifuge
tube and then adding 60 μL of substrate. After incubation at
room temperature in the dark for 30 min, the reaction was stopped
by adding 50 μL of the stop solution. Finally, the LDH release
was quantified by monitoring the absorbance at 490 nm.

Determination
of Intracellular ROS
The ROS production
was evaluated by using DCFH-DA, a nonfluorescent compound, which can
readily diffuse into water and interact with ROS. After incubation
with different concentrations of BQAS for 3 h, the bacterial suspensions
were washed and stained with 10 μm DCFH-DA (Beyotime Biotechnology)
for 20 min in dark at 25 °C. Green fluorescent ROS-producing
cells were visualized with a fluorescence microscope at a 488 nm excitation
wavelength. The areas of observation were randomly photographed with
a Nikon fluorescence microscope.

The possibility of superoxide
anion (O2•–) production was evaluated
to determine the oxidative stress using the superoxide assay kit (Beyotime
Biotechnology). Briefly, 200 μL of the bacterial suspension
was centrifuged and washed twice with sterile water, followed by adding
200 μL of detection solution and incubating at 37 °C for
5–10 min. Next, the bacterial samples were incubated with different
concentrations of BQAS under the same conditions as described above.
Finally, the samples were examined by a microplate absorbance reader
at 450 nm.

Leakage of Intracellular Components
To further verify
the destruction of the cell membrane, related experiments were performed
to evaluate the release of protein and DNA of the bacterial cells.
The protein content was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime
Biotechnology), and DNA was examined by agarose gels.
