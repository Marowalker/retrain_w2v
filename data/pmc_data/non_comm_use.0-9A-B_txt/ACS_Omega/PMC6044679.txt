Arsenic (As) contamination in aqueous
solutions has become an increasing
public concern due to the immense harm to human health. Herein, bioaccumulation
of arsenate (As(V)) by Rhizopus oryzae in aqueous systems was investigated under different environmental
conditions, such as different pH’s, ionic strengths, mycelia
dosages, mycelia growths, and temperatures. The results showed that
As(V) could be bioaccumulated efficiently by R. oryzae, and the maximum bioaccumulation capacity of As(V) in R. oryzae was 52.4 mg/g at T = 299
K, which was much higher than that for other biomaterials under similar
conditions. R. oryzae generated a higher
content of thiol compounds under As(V) stress to immobilize As(V)
from aqueous solutions. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy analysis
indicated that As(V) was partly reduced to As(III) with increasing
contact time, which increased As(V) bioaccumulation in mycelia. In
addition, extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis showed
that the As–S complex played an important role in As(V) immobilization
by mycelia. This study provided an
in-depth investigation of intracellular As speciation and coordination
in R. oryzae on the molecular scale,
which was crucial to understand the interaction mechanisms of As(V)
with fungi during environmental cleanup.

==== Body
Introduction
Arsenic (As) is known to be one of the
most powerful poisons in
the world,1−3 which can enter drinking water through natural processes
(i.e., volcanic emissions, biological activities, and weathering of
minerals containing As) and anthropogenic processes (e.g., discharges
from industrial wastes and burning of fossil fuels and use of arsenical
pesticides).4−7 In natural waters, As is present as arsenate (As(V)) under oxic
conditions and arsenite (As(III)) under anoxic conditions.8,9 High levels of arsenic in drinking water have been detected in many
countries, including Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China.10−13 Long-term exposure to As-containing wastewater can result in serious
diseases, such as cancer (i.e., cancer of the lung, skin, kidney,
nasal passages, liver, and prostate), and can negatively affect the
gastrointestinal tract and cardiac, vascular, and central nervous
systems.14 Hence, it is an urgent
necessity to reduce As in aqueous solutions to levels below the World
Health Organization limit of As in drinking water (10 μg/L).15

In recent years,
the removal of As from aqueous solutions using various materials,
such as nanomaterials,16−18 resins,19,20 minerals,21,22 and microorganisms, has been extensively investigated.23−26 Bioremediation of As(V) by microorganisms has been a focus of research
because it is environmentally friendly, produces only a few by-products,
and is cost-effective. Microorganisms have evolved various mechanisms
to deal with As toxicity, including reducing the number of intracellular
As molecules and biotransformation of As species by oxidation, reduction,
and methylation.27,28 It is reported that fungi living
in As-contaminated sites have evolved different cellular and molecular
systems to survive and have unique merits, such as high bioaccumulation
and tolerance to As, high cell wall binding capacity, and high intracellular
As uptake capacity.29−32 To date, the bioaccumulation and tolerance of As(V) by fungi have
been extensively reported upon,33−35 whereas less information about
fungal immobilization for As(V) bioremediation is available.

In this study, the As(V)-resistant fungus Rhizopus
oryzae was isolated from As-contaminated sites and
was evaluated for its bioaccumulation efficiency for the bioaccumulation
of As(V) from wastewater by the batch technique. Subsequently, the
resistance of the fungus to As(V) after different aging times was
investigated by X-ray absorption spectrometry (XAFS), including X-ray
absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, to understand the interaction
mechanism of As immobilized in R. oryzae.

Results and Discussion
Identification and Characterization
The isolate exhibiting
resistance to As(V) was subjected to molecular identification. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region
yielded a PCR product of 743 bp and
blasted to the NCBI-GenBank showing 99% homology to R. oryzae (accession number KM491890.1).
Therefore, the fungus was identified as R. oryzae.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) micrographs of mycelia are shown in Figure 1. Before As(V) bioaccumulation,
the mycelia were flat and had fewer branches and more folding (Figure 1a), whereas after
As(V) bioaccumulation, the mycelia were cylindrical and exhibited
more branches (Figure 1b). From the TEM images (Figure1c,d), it can
be seen that the fungal cell structure had obviously changed after
As(V) bioaccumulation. The fungal intracellular inclusions significantly
increased after As(V) treatment. The above results indicated that
more fungal intracellular inclusions were induced to adapt to As(V)
stress.36

As(V)-loaded R. oryzae (b). TEM images
of R. oryzae (c) and As(V)-loaded R. oryzae (d).

The titration curve was plotted for a 0.01 mol/L NaNO3 solution and displayed nearly identical buffering capacities
across
the pH range studied (Figure 2a). The surface of R. oryzae was positively charged at pH < 6.5, whereas the surface of R. oryzae was negatively charged at pH > 6.5.
The
point of zero change (pHpzc) of R. oryzae was measured to be 6.5.

Mycelia Growth under As(V)
Stress
The growth change
of the mycelia with an increase in As(V) concentration was studied. Figure 2b shows
a weak increase in the biomass of R. oryzae with an increase in the As(V) concentration from 0 to 70 mg/L. This
is because that the fungal metabolism by utilizing the culture environment
created a need for the growth of its own energy.37 For As(V) concentrations higher than 70 mg/L, the biomass
of R. oryzae decreased rapidly with
increasing As(V) concentration. Fungal resistance to As(V) in the
environment has a certain tolerance threshold, and As(V) concentrations
higher than the threshold value may affect the growth of fungi.27

Role of pH and Ionic Strength in As(V) Bioaccumulation
The effects of As(V) bioaccumulation on mycelia as a function of
the pH of the medium are shown in Figure 3a. One can see that the bioaccumulation of
As(V) by the mycelia decreased slightly with an increase in the pH
from 2.0 and 6.0, and a significant decrease was observed at pH >
6.0. The pH values of the system
greatly affected As(V) bioaccumulation by both the ionization status
of functional groups on mycelia and As speciation. As shown in Figure 3b, As(V) was present
in H2AsO4– from pH’s
3.0 to 6.0 and in HAsO42– from pH’s
8.0 to 10.5.17 As shown in Figure 2a, a negative charge of the
mycelial surface was observed at pH > 6.5. Therefore, the significant
decrease in As(V) on the mycelia at pH > 6.5 was mainly attributed
to the electrostatic repulsion between H2AsO4–/HAsO42– and the
negatively charged mycelial surface.

Relative distribution of As(V) species as a function of pH on the
basis of the equilibrium constants (b).

The effect of ionic strength on the bioaccumulation of As(V)
in
mycelia is also shown in Figure 4a. The removal of As(V) significantly decreased with
increasing NaNO3 concentrations (from 0.01 to 0.06 mol/L).
The ionic strength-dependent adsorption indicated that ion exchange
or outer-sphere surface complexation mainly contributed to As(V) bioaccumulation.
Furthermore, partial aggregation of mycelia at higher ionic strengths
also resulted in a decrease in the available sites on the mycelia.38

bioaccumulation by R. oryzae (b). Effect
of contact time on As(V) bioaccumulation by R. oryzae (c). T = 299 K, C[As(V)]initial = 15 mg/L, and pH = 5.5.

Effect of R. oryzae Dosage
The effect of R. oryzae dosage on
As(V) bioaccumulation and the extent of removal of As(V) are shown
in Figure 4b. As(V)
bioaccumulation increased with an increase in R. oryzae dosage in the early stage, and the bioaccumulation remained high
at dosages >1.1 g/L. This trend could be explained by the fact
that
functional groups on the mycelia increased with an increase in R. oryzae dosage, whereas Kd reduced gradually with an increase in the R. oryzae dosage. Partial aggregation of mycelia
at a higher dosage resulted in a decrease in the effective surface
area for As(V) bioaccumulation.39

Bioaccumulation
Kinetics
The kinetics of As(V) bioaccumulation
was studied using pseudo-first-order (ln(Q – Qt) = ln Q – Kt) and pseudo-second-order  equations,
where Qt refers to the adsorbability of
As(V) (mg/g) at time t (h) and K (1/h) and K′
(g/(mg h)) are the bioaccumulation rate constants.40 The major portion of As(V) was completely coordinated to
the adsorbents within 12 h (Figure 4c). Therefore, all bioaccumulation experiments were
performed for 24 h to ensure bioaccumulation equilibrium. Data points
were fitted better with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model as compared
to that with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the kinetic
parameters from both models are listed in Table 1. The results on the kinetics indicate that R. oryzae possesses a high bioaccumulation efficiency
for As(V).

Bioaccumulation Isotherms
Figure 5a shows the isotherms for As(V) bioaccumulation
by R. oryzae at pH 5.5. The As(V) bioaccumulation
capacity of R. oryzae increased rapidly
with an increase in the As(V) dosage at the initial phase, and it
later arrived at the platform.
It was also observed that
the isotherms showed an increase in bioaccumulation as the temperature
increased, and the maximum bioaccumulation occurred at a temperature
of 319 K, which indicated the endothermic nature of As(V) bioaccumulation.
The bioaccumulation data were fitted to Langmuir (Q = b × Qmax × Ce/(1 + b × Ce)) and Freundlich (Q = KF × Cen) models (Q and Qmax are the amount of As(V) adsorbed
on the mycelia and the maximum adsorption amount of As(V) accumulated
on the mycelia (mg/g) at complete monolayer coverage, respectively; b (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant related to the bioaccumulation
heat; KF (mg1–n Ln/g) represents the bioaccumulation
capacity when the equilibrium concentration of As(V) is 1, and n represents the degree of dependence of bioaccumulation
at equilibrium concentration). It was found that the bioaccumulation
of As(V) on R. oryzae correlated well
with the Langmuir equation as compared to that with the Freundlich
equation (Table 2 and Figure 5a). The Cs max values of As(V) on the mycelia was 52.4 mg/g
at 299 K and was higher than those of many corresponding biomaterials
reported in the literature (Table 3).41−46 Therefore, R. oryzae possesses a
higher capacity for As(V) sequestration, leading to its potential
applicability in As(V) bioremediation.

Intracellular Thiol Content
The intracellular thiol
content is shown in Figure 5b. The level of intracellular thiol increased in response
to As(V) exposure. The maximum increases in the thiol content were
143% (at 200 mg/L) and 201% (at 400 mg/L) after 24 h of exposure,
whereas the increases were 87% (at 200 mg/L) and 132% (at 400 mg/L)
after 72 h of exposure. The increase in the intracellular thiol content
of R. oryzae may indicate the role
of thiols in the detoxification or tolerance of As(V). These results
are in accordance
with the thiol groups, which may form complex with As(V) as a part
of tolerance mechanism.34 Canovas et al.
also showed that soluble thiol species played a key role in the response
of Aspergillus sp. P37 to arsenic, and thiol–As
complexes were formed and contributed in the vacuoles of Aspergillus sp. P37.47

Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Analysis
The FTIR
spectra of R. oryzae and As(V)-loaded R. oryzae are displayed in Figure 6a. The characteristic bands of As(V)-loaded R. oryzae shifted in comparison to those for R. oryzae, such as the bands corresponding to the
−OH stretching vibration (from 3461 to 3597 cm–1), N–H stretching and C=O stretching vibrations of
the amide group (from 1664 to 1636 cm–1), and C–N
stretching vibrations (from 1074 to 1119 cm–1).
Besides, the weak peak
at 2551 cm–1 represented the disappearance of the
thiol groups after As(V) bioaccumulation in the mycelia.48 Hence, hydroxyl, amino, and thiol groups are
possibly involved in As(V) bioaccumulation in the mycelia.49−51

XAFS Spectral Analysis
The intracellular As of fungal
mycelia was investigated by the XANES and EXAFS techniques. The XANES
spectra of As in R. oryzae are presented
in Figure 6b and demonstrate
differences between 11 868 and 11 873 eV. The absorption
edge energies of As(III) and As(V) were 11 870.9 and 11 874.4
eV, respectively.24,52 The results showed that As speciation
in fungal mycelia transformed with an increase in aging time. After
4 h of culture at pH 5.5, only As(V) was detected. Both As(V) and
As(III) were found in the mycelia of R. oryzae after 4 days of culture, and the predominant valence state of As
in the mycelia was As(V). After 8 days of culture, both As(V) and
As(III) were detected, and the As(III) content was higher than that
of As(V) within the mycelia. These results indicated that R. oryzae had a strong ability to reduce As(V) to
As(III) and immobilized As(III), which thereby decreased the arsenic
toxicity.53

The best fits of the
EXAFS spectra
of As in R. oryzae are shown in Figure 7. The fitted structural
parameters (coordination number (CN), R, and σ2) are listed in Table 4. The k3-weighted χ(k) spectra (Figure 7a) and radial structure functions (RSFs) (Figure 7b) of the samples were all
different, which suggested that As in the mycelia of R. oryzae samples had different coordination structures.
At a cultivation period of 4 h and a of pH 5.5, the peak at ∼1.67
± 0.02 Å, with CN varying from 3.6 to 4, was indicative
of the first shell of As–O, which was in good agreement with
that for arsenate.18,54 After 4 days of culture, the
first coordination shell surrounding the As atom still contained oxygens,
and the As–O distances changed from 1.69 to 1.76 Å, which
was similar to that for As(III). Moreover, the second shell distinctly
showed that As was coordinated with sulfur atoms.55 Especially after 8 days of culture, the CN of As–S
increased from 1.4 to 1.7 and the CN of As–O decreased, indicating
that the amount of As coordinated to sulfur increased as the aging
time increased.56 Furthermore, the As speciation
in the mycelia from EXAFS analysis was consistent with the XANES results.
XAFS data provided information on the average As coordination in the
mycelia illuminated by synchrotron light, and it was difficult to
acquire exact information on a pure compound from the mixture. At
best, we can suggest that As was present as a mixture of coordinated
compounds As(III)–O and As(III)–S. As(III) had a strong
affinity for thiols; thus, the thiol group was probably responsible
for the coordination with As(III). Former researches have shown that
As stimulated the production of thiol compounds,55,57 and the As atom was bound to S atoms from different cysteine (Cys)
residues, with R values varying from 2.2 to 2.25
Å.57−59

R.
oryzae was isolated from As-contaminated
soils and used to bioremediate As(V) under different environmental
conditions. R. oryzae showed a high
capacity to accumulate As(V), and the equilibrium bioaccumulation
data can be satisfactorily simulated by the Langmuir model. The results
from XAFS analysis indicated that most of the intracellular As(V)
was reduced to As(III) and complexed with thiols after 8 days of culture,
which contributed to understanding the interaction mechanisms of As
in R. oryzae under As(V) stress. After
As(V) is bioreduced
to As(III) on R. oryzae, it can be
immobilized on R. oryzae and can thereby
decrease As(III) pollution. These findings showed that R. oryzae could be an efficient and promising bioremediation
material for As(V) pollution.

Experimental Section
Isolation
and Identification of As(V)-Resistant Fungus
A soil sample
was collected from As-contaminated sites in Dengjiatang,
Chenzhou City, and Hunan Province, China. The soil sample (1.0 g)
was suspended in 100 mL of sterile distilled water. Serial dilutions
were conducted to
obtain a solution of 10–5 dilution for fungal isolation.
Then, a 200 μL suspension was plated onto a sterile potato dextrose
agar (PDA) plate containing 500 mg/g As(V). The plate was incubated
at 26 °C for 4 days of culture. All colonies that appeared on
each plate were marked, the colony-forming units were calculated,
and pure cultures were maintained on PDA slants at 4 °C. The
DNA of the isolate was extracted,60 and
18S rDNA was amplified by PCR using universal fungal primers: ITS1F:
5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′/ITS4: 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′.
Amplification was performed for 35 PCR cycles, with annealing at 95
°C for 40 s, extension at 55 °C for 30 s, and denaturation
at 72 °C for 1 min. Then, the PCR products
were applied to sequence (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). The sequences
were matched against nucleotide sequences from GenBank using BLASTN.

Characterization of Mycelia
Morphological analysis
of R. oryzae was performed by SEM (FEI-JSM
6320F) and TEM (JEM-2010, Japan). For SEM analysis, fungal mycelia
of R. oryzae and As(V)-adsorbed R. oryzae were fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C
for 4 h; washed with 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer; and then dehydrated
sequentially in 10, 30, 70, 90, and 100% ethanol; they were finally
critical-point-dried and gold-coated with stubs for analysis. For
TEM analysis, the samples were prefixed with 5% glutaraldehyde, infiltrated
with resin, and then sectioned to a 70 nm thickness with an ultramicrotome
(Leica EM UC7, Austria) and collected on copper grids for analysis.
The functional groups of the mycelia were analyzed by an automatic
titrator system (DL58; Mettler Toledo, Germany) and an infrared spectrophotometer
(Perkin-Elmer 100).

Bioaccumulation Procedures
Bioaccumulation
of As(V)
by mycelia was studied under ambient conditions. The different
concentrations of mycelia suspensions, As(V) and NaNO3 solution
were added into Erlenmeyer flasks. Thereafter, the pH was adjusted
to the desired value with negligible amounts of HNO3 or
NaOH solution. After bioaccumulation equilibrium was reached, the
solid phase was separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation
at 9000 rpm for 20 min. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Shimazu
ICPE-9000) was used to measure the As(V) concentration in the supernatant.
The bioaccumulation percentage and As(V) accumulation capacity (Q; mg/g) are described in eqs 1 and 2 1   2  Where C0 and Ce (mg/L) are the initial and equilibrium
concentrations,
respectively, and m and V are the
mass of the mycelia and volume of the suspension, respectively. All
tests were conducted in triplicate.

Assay of Intracellular
Thiol Content
The concentration
of intracellular thiol groups was determined using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at 412 nm.34 Briefly, 0.2 g of fresh mycelia was ground in a 2 mL centrifuge
tube in liquid nitrogen, extracted with 1.0 mL of 5% sulfosalicylic
acid, and then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C.
Finally, 200 μL of the supernatant was mixed with 600 μL
of 0.2 mol/L Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) and 40 μL of 10 mmol/L
5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid).

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Briefly, the PDA liquid medium
in 250 mL flask bottles containing 500 mg/L As(V) and 2.0 g/L mycelia
at 26 °C for different aging times of culture, and fungal mycelia
were harvested and washed with sterile Milli-Q water and phosphate-buffered
saline to remove the residual As(V). Then, XAFS of the fungal samples
was conducted at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, with
an electron storage ring energy of 3.5 GeV and a maximum storage beam
current of 210 mA. A double-crystal Si(111) monochromator was used.
A multielement pixel high-purity Ge solid-state detector was used
to record the fluorescence signal. Sodium arsenite and sodium arsenate
were used as references for XAFS evaluation. As K edge
EXAFS spectra were extracted from the subtraction of pre-edge, background,
and post-edge, the correction of energy. The k3-weighted EXAFS data and Fourier-transformed RSFs were analyzed
using the Athena and Artemis interfaces of IFFEFIT 7.0 software.61,62 The CN, interatomic distance (R), and Debye–Waller
factor (σ2) were allowed to float as adjustable parameters.
