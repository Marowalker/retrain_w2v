In yeast, the formation of Ure2 fibrils
underlies the prion state [URE3], in which the yeast loses the ability
to distinguish good nitrogen sources from bad ones. The Ure2 prion
domain is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of amyloid
fibrils. Understanding the structure of Ure2 fibrils is important
for understanding the propagation not only of the [URE3] prion but
also of other yeast prions whose prion domains share similar features,
such as the enrichment of asparagine and glutamine residues. Here,
we report a structural study of the amyloid fibrils formed by the
Ure2 prion domain using site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We completed a spin label scanning of
all the residue positions between 2 and 80 of the Ure2 prion domain.
The EPR data show that the Ure2 fibril core consists of residues 8–68
and adopts a parallel in-register β-sheet structure. Most of
the residues show strong spin–exchange interactions, suggesting
that there are only short turns and no long loops in the fibril core.
Based on the strength of spin–exchange interactions, we determined
the likely locations of the β-strands. EPR data also show that
the C-terminal region of the Ure2 prion domain is more disordered
than the N-terminal region. The roles of hydrophobic and charged residues
are analyzed. Overall, the structure of Ure2 fibrils appears to involve
a balance of stabilizing interactions, such as asparagine ladders,
and destabilizing interactions, such as stacking of charged residues.

Introduction
Prions are infectious
proteins that propagate the prion state by converting the prion protein
from a non-prion conformation to a prion conformation.1,2 In mammals, prions are the basis of transmissible encephalopathies,
including the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans,3 bovine spongiform encephalopathies in cattle,4 and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk.5 In yeast, prions are responsible for some non-chromosomal
genetic elements, such as [PSI+] and [URE3].6,7 The
structures of amyloid fibrils give insights into how prions propagate
their prion phenotype. Intriguingly, the same protein may adopt multiple
structures in the amyloid fibrils, underlying a phenomenon called
prion strains that are manifested by different disease sub-types of
the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.8

Ure2 from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a 354-residue protein that consists of two domains: an N-terminal
prion domain of ∼90 residues and a C-terminal functional domain.9 The structure of the C-terminal domain has been
solved by X-ray crystallography and shows that Ure2 is part of the
glutathione transferase superfamily.10,11 It has been
shown that Ure2 has glutathione peroxidase and glutaredoxin activities.12,13 The C-terminal domain suppresses the expression of enzymes and transporters
responsible for catabolizing poor nitrogen sources when a good nitrogen
source is present.14 In the prion state
called [URE3], however, the yeast does not distinguish between good
and poor nitrogen sources. The prion domain is necessary for the [URE3]
phenotype and amyloid fibril formation.15 An isolated Ure2 prion domain forms fibrils in vitro by itself,16 adopts a structure that is similar to the fibrils
of full-length Ure2 protein,17 and is able
to convert yeast cells from the non-prion to prion state.18

In the last several years, significant
progress has been made in the understanding of amyloid structures
in general, including the amyloid structures of Aβ,19 α-synuclein,20 and tau,21,22 but the molecular structure of
yeast prion fibrils is still elusive. Currently, a number of yeast
prions have been shown to form amyloid fibrils.6 Ure2 and Sup35 are two of the best characterized yeast
prions. Evidence from solid-state NMR,17,23 prion assays
of scrambled sequence,24 and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR)25,26 shows that the amyloid fibrils
of Ure2 prion domain adopt a parallel in-register β-sheet structure,
but the detailed locations of β-strands and turns are still
lacking. Gorkovskiy et al.27 used solid-state
NMR to identify the locations of turns in Sup35 amyloid fibrils with
isotope labeling at 16 residue positions. Their study confirmed the
parallel in-register β-sheet structure of Sup35 fibrils, but
the spatial resolution is not high enough to identify all the β-strands
and turns. Similar efforts using solid-state NMR have not been attempted
on Ure2 fibrils. Identifying the locations of β-strands and
turns would represent a significant step forward in the understanding
of the Ure2 fibril structure.

Most of the amyloid fibrils studied
to date adopt a parallel in-register β-sheet structure.28 In such a structure, the side chains at the
same residue position but from different protein chains stack on top
of each other (Figure 1A). The average distance between these neighboring side chains is
the same as the inter-strand distance in a β-sheet, which is
4.75 Å. When the amyloid fibrils are formed by a protein spin
labeled at a the β-strand site, the stacking of the spin label
side chains leads to strong spin–exchange interactions between
the spin labels.29 As a result, the spin-labeled
amyloid fibrils give a characteristic single-line EPR spectrum, a
diagnostic feature for the parallel in-register β-sheet structure
(Figure 1B). If the
spin label is introduced at a residue located in a turn or loop region,
then the EPR spectrum shows a different lineshape, indicating weaker
spin–exchange interactions. Therefore, scanning through all
the residue positions of the amyloid core with spin labeling can identify
the location of β-strands and turns with the aid of a quantitative
analysis of the spin–exchange interactions.26,30

Figure 1 Spin-labeled
amyloid fibrils show characteristic single-line EPR spectra. (A) A
stick model of the spin label R1 in a parallel in-register β-sheet
structure, commonly found in the core of amyloid fibrils formed by
various proteins, including the yeast prion protein Ure2. This side-chain
packing of the spin label R1 is based on the crystal packing of the
spin-labeling reagent MTSSL. (B) Simulated EPR spectra with varying
strengths of spin–exchange interactions. Note that increasing
spin–exchange interactions leads to the collapse of the high-field
and low-field resonance lines toward the center line and results in
a single-line feature when the exchange frequency is above 100 MHz.
When the exchange frequency is above 200 MHz, the bumpy features at
both low-field and high-field lines are smoothed out and the EPR spectrum
becomes a complete single-line spectrum.

To locate the β-strands, turns, and loops in the amyloid fibrils
of the yeast prion protein Ure2, spin labels were introduced, one
at a time, at residues 2–80 of the Ure2 prion domain. EPR spectra
of these 79 spin-labeled Ure2 fibril samples provide detailed structural
information on the amyloid core at a single-residue resolution. Our
results show that the amyloid core of the Ure2 fibrils consists of
residues 8–68. Based on the strength of the spin–spin
interaction, likely β-strands are assigned. The roles of polar,
hydrophobic, and charged residues in the stabilization of the Ure2
fibril structure are discussed.

Results
The Amyloid
Core of Ure2 Fibrils
We completed a spin label scanning from
residue 2 to residue 80 of the Ure2 prion domain. Previously, only
27 residue positions have been studied with spin labeling.25,26 To study the structure of amyloid fibrils formed by the yeast prion
protein Ure2, we prepared spin-labeled Ure2 fibrils in a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer at 37 °C without agitation. The EPR spectra
at labeling sites 2–15 were taken from the study of Ngo et
al.,26 but all other samples were prepared
in this study. Figure 2 shows the EPR spectra of the 79 fibril samples formed by the spin-labeled
Ure2 prion domain, along with the best fits from spectral simulations.
Most of these EPR spectra display the so-called single-line feature
(e.g., V9R1), in which the low-field and high-field lines of the typical
three-line EPR spectrum merge with the center line (see also Figure 1B). This single-line
spectrum is diagnostic of the parallel in-register β-sheet structure
of amyloid fibrils.29 As shown in Figure 2, single-line-like
spectra can be identified from residue 8 at the N-terminal region
to residue 75 at the C-terminal region, suggesting that almost the
entire length of Ure2 prion domain adopts a highly ordered structure.
This is consistent with our previous EPR study on Ure2 prion fibrils,
in which spin labels were introduced at every 5th residue position
of the Ure2 prion domain.25

Figure 2 EPR spectra of Ure2 amyloid
fibrils with spin labels at residues 2–80. The experimental
spectra (black traces) are superimposed on the best fit of the simulated
spectra (red traces). EPR spectral simulation and fitting was used
to extract the strength of the spin–exchange interaction. All
spectra are normalized to the same number of spins. The scan width
is 200 G.

Spin labeling at every residue
position from 2 to 80 allows us to identify the locations of the β-strand
and turn regions through a quantitative analysis of the spin–exchange
interactions. Previous EPR studies on spin-labeled Aβ fibrils30−32 show an excellent agreement with other high-resolution methods,
including solid-state NMR33−37 and cryoEM,19 suggesting that this is
a valid approach to obtain the secondary structure information. The
strength of the spin–exchange interaction can be obtained using
spectral simulations, which were performed on all the EPR data presented
in Figure 2. Previously
published spectra (residues 2–15) were also re-analyzed here
to ensure consistency among all spectral simulations. The exchange
frequency as a function of residue positions in the Ure2 prion domain
is shown in Figure 3A. We previously developed an empirical parameter called the “single-line
ratio”, which can be measured directly from the EPR spectra.26 The single-line ratios for residues 2–80
are shown in Figure 3B. The single-line ratio measures the upward shift of the low-field
peak (i.e., the bump to the left of the center peak) as a ratio to
the center-line amplitude (distance n in Figure 3B). The calculation
of the single-line ratio is modified from our previous report.26 In the present study, the upward shift of the
low-field peak relative to baseline (distance m in Figure 3B) is used to calculate
the single-line ratio, while the upward shift relative to the lowest
point of the spectrum was used in the previous report.26 The modified calculation changes the range of
the single-line ratio from approximately 0.5–1 in the previous
report to 0–0.5 in this study. In the absence of spin–exchange
interactions, the single-line ratio would be zero, making the interpretation
of the single-line ratio more intuitive using the modified calculation
here. The calculation of the single-line ratio does not require sophisticated
spectral simulations and is thus immune to the choice of motional
models and fitting parameters. Therefore, the single-line ratio provides
a general validation for the simulation to ensure that the fitting
parameters provide reasonable results. The shortcoming of the single-line
ratio analysis is that it cannot quantify the changes when the spin–exchange
interaction is very strong and the bumpy feature to the left of the
center peak is smoothed out. When a spectrum consists of multiple
components, the single-ratio may be obscured by the presence of non-exchange
spectral components, such as the spectra at the C-terminal region
of the Ure2 prion domain. Overall, the plots of the spin–exchange
frequency in Figure 3A and the single-line ratio in Figure 3B are remarkably similar, suggesting that the exchange
frequencies obtained from spectral simulations reflect the main changes
in the lineshape. The main difference between these two plots is at
the C-terminal region. The single-line ratio shows that residues 69–80
have overall lower values than the preceding segment (residues 48–68).
The exchange frequency numbers obtained from spectral simulations
show that the residues with stronger exchange interactions among residues
69–80 are on par with residues 48–68. This is because
the EPR spectra at this region consist of two spectral components:
one component with exchange interactions and the other component without
interactions. The non-exchange component makes the use of the single-line
ratio problematic because it obscures the spectral changes resulting
from spin–exchange interactions.

Figure 3 Quantitative analysis
of the spin–exchange interactions in Ure2 fibrils reveals locations
of β-strands and turns. (A) Plot of spin–exchange frequency
obtained from spectral simulation and fitting as a function of residue
positions in the Ure2 prion domain. Block arrows represent the β-strands,
and numbers in parentheses are the range of residues for each β-strand.
(B) Single-line ratio, an empirical measure of spin–exchange
interactions, is plotted as a function of residue positions in the
Ure2 prion domain. Inset shows how the single-line ratio is calculated.
In the inset, line z is half-way between x and y. Distance m measures
the upward shift for the center of the low-field peak relative to
the baseline. For a spectrum without exchange interactions, m = 0. Distance n measures the amplitude
of the center line. If the bumpy feature at the low-field line is
completely smoothed out, distance m cannot be determined
and the single-line ratio is arbitrarily set at 0.5.

In the plot of the spin–exchange frequency, there
are “peaks” and “valleys”. Peaks represent
three or more consecutive residues with high exchange frequencies,
and valleys represent residues with lower exchange frequencies than
their immediate neighbors. When assigning “valleys”,
we consider both the absolute value of the spin–exchange frequency
and the relative value compared to the neighboring positions. We assign
the residues in the peaks to the β-strand structure, and we
assign valleys to turns. We consider that turns consist of more than
one residue and assign the one-residue valley to a “kink”
in the β-strand structure. Based on this principle of analysis,
we identified 7 β-strand regions: residues 8–11, 15–21,
24–30, 33–41, 44–46, 48–68 (Figure 3). It is worth noting that
residues 48–68 all show strong spin–exchange interactions,
but they may not form a single long β-strand. If there were
connecting turns within region 48–68 and these turns were highly
ordered, we would still observe strong spin–exchange interactions.

For residues 69–80, some residues such as 74 and 75 show
single-line EPR spectra, indicating strong spin–exchange interactions.
At the same time, residues in this region all require a second spectral
component in spectral simulation and fitting. This suggests that the
local structural stability of this region is low (see the section
“Local Structural Stability in Ure2 Fibrils” below). Therefore, we believe that this region also adopts
a parallel in-register
β-sheet structure, but with lower stability than the core residues
from 8 to 68. In a previous study with spin labels introduced at every
5th residue position, we observed that residues 70, 75, and 80 were
highly ordered, but the strength of exchange interaction and local
stability were lower than those of residues 30–65 in the center
region.25 We assigned residues 70–80
to be in an outer core region for their lower structural stability.
In the same study,25 we also found that
residues 10, 15, 20, and 25 showed weaker exchange interactions than
the center residues 30–65. With higher spatial labeling density
in this work, we do not see a structural difference between residues
10–25 and 30–65. Therefore, we abandoned the use of
the inner core and outer core and consider that residues 8–68
form the amyloid core of the Ure2 prion domain. It is worth noting,
however, that residues 69–80 are still highly ordered and may
also adopt parallel in-register β-sheet structures.

Reproducibility
of EPR Spectra for Spin-Labeled Ure2 Fibrils
During the course
of EPR studies on Ure2 fibrils, fibrils of some spin-labeled Ure2
mutants were prepared more than once. This provides an opportunity
to evaluate the reproducibility of the EPR spectral features for these
spin-labeled amyloid fibrils. Figure 4 shows two EPR spectra at 10 labeling positions. The
two EPR spectra of the same mutant have been obtained using different
batches of spin-labeled Ure2 proteins in separate fibril preparations.
The two EPR spectra for the same mutant are very similar to each other,
reflecting not only the similar strength of spin–exchange interactions
but also fine details such as the bumps to the left of the center
peak. The reproducibility of the EPR spectra at each labeling site
suggests that each labeling site is unique and distinguishable from
other residue positions, likely reflecting the unique local atomic
contacts surrounding each label. Margittai and Langen29 pointed out that the differences in EPR spectra among different
labeling sites may be direct fingerprints for each labeling position,
resulting from different backbone and site-chain contacts. The observation
that the specific EPR spectral features can be reproduced in separate
experiments supports this notion.

Figure 4 Reproducibility of EPR spectra for spin-labeled
Ure2 mutants. For each mutant, experiment 1 and experiment 2 represent
two different batches of spin labeling and fibril preparation. All
spectra are normalized to the same number of spins. Scan width is
200 G.

Local Structural Stability
in Ure2 Fibrils
The EPR studies of spin-labeled Ure2 fibrils
allow us to evaluate the local structural stability at a single-residue
resolution. Most of the spin-labeled Ure2 variants can be simulated
with one structural state, but some Ure2 variants require two structural
states: one structured state and one disordered state. The simulated
spectral components at these sites are shown in Figure 5A. Because the disordered state appears only
in some Ure2 variants, we conclude that the disordered state represents
a local structural disorder, rather than a global structural disorder.
Therefore, spectral simulations of the EPR data can reveal where the
local structural disorder appears at a single-residue resolution,
and the percentage of the disordered state represents the extent of
the disorder. The percentage of the disordered state as a function
of the labeling position is plotted in Figure 5B. These residues are located at the N- and
C-terminal regions. Residues 2–7 all show a small proportion
of the locally disordered state between 6% and 12%. Residues 66–75
show 3–16% of disordered states, while the terminal residues
76–80 show 9−43% of disordered state. This is consistent
with the idea of a hierarchical organization in the amyloid core of
Ure2 fibrils,25 which suggests that the
packing of the amyloid core is not uniform. Overall, the center of
the core packs more tightly than the outer residues, and the N-terminal
region is more stable than the C-terminal region in the amyloid core
of the Ure2 prion domain.

Figure 5 Local structural stability as indicated by the
percentage of disordered components in the EPR spectra. For EPR spectra
at sites 2–7 and 66–80, two spectral components representing
a structured state and a locally disordered state were used in spectral
simulation and fitting. The individual spectral components are shown
in (A), and the percentage of the disordered component is shown in
(B). The presence of disordered components at N- and C-terminal regions
suggests a lower structural stability at these residue positions compared
to center residues.

Seeded Aggregation of the
Ure2 Prion Domain
The Ure2 construct we used for structural
studies in this work is a fusion protein of the Ure2 prion domain
(residues 1–89) at the N-terminus and the M domain of the Sup35
protein at the C-terminus. This construct was originally created by
Alberti et al.38 in a systematic effort
to identify potential prions in yeast. Due to poor solubility of the
Ure2 prion domain by itself, the Sup35M domain was used to aid in
vitro protein purifications. This is particularly helpful when a large
number of mutants need to be purified for spin-labeling studies. We
have previously shown that the aggregation kinetics of the Ure2p1–89–Sup35M construct show a sigmoidal curve,39 consistent with a nucleation-dependent polymerization
model. Here, we performed a seeded aggregation experiment to investigate
if pre-formed Ure2 fibril seeds can promote the aggregation of Ure2p1–89–Sup35M. Figure 6 shows that the presence of 10% Ure2 fibril
seeds promotes the aggregation of Ure2p1–89–Sup35M.
The difference between seeded and non-seeded aggregation is small
but notable. The ability to self-seed provides the biochemical basis
for the Ure2 construct used in this study to propagate its conformation
as a yeast prion. However, it has not been demonstrated that this
Ure2 construct can infect and propagate yeast cells from in vitro
prepared fibrils. Spin labeling at various residue positions of the
Ure2 prion domain may have unpredictable effects on its ability to
propagate the prion phenotype in vivo. These are some of the limitations
that may affect the relevance of the spin-labeling studies in the
context of yeast prion biology.

Figure 6 Seeded aggregation kinetics of the Ure2
prion domain. The aggregation of the Ure2 prion domain was followed
with thioflavin T fluorescence at 37 °C without agitation. Four
repeats of Ure2 in the absence of fibril seeds (red traces) and in
the presence of 10% pre-formed fibril seeds (blue traces) are shown.
Note that Ure2 fibril seeds caused a small but notable leftward shift
of the aggregation curve, suggesting that fibril seeds promoted Ure2
fibril formation. AU, arbitrary units.

Discussion
In this work, we used site-directed spin labeling
and EPR to study the structure of the amyloid fibrils formed by the
prion domain of Ure2 protein. All residue positions from 2 to 80 were
studied to achieve a single-residue resolution in our EPR analysis
(Figure 2). The quantitative
analysis of the spin–exchange interactions revealed that the
amyloid core of Ure2 fibrils covers residues 8–68 (Figure 3). Residues 69–80
may also adopt β-sheet structures but with a lower local structural
stability (Figure 5). Previous solid-state NMR studies have shown that the Ure2 prion
domain forms fibrils of a parallel in-register β-sheet structure,
but the amyloid core has not been well defined.17,23 Our results are consistent with a proteinase K digestion study of
Ure2 fibrils, which put the boundary of the prion domain at residues
6–9 at the N-terminus and residues 63–70 at the C-terminus.40

Spin labeling at every residue position
between 2 and 80 of the Ure2 prion domain allows us to identify potential
β-strand and turn regions. We assigned 7 potential β-strands
at residues 8–11, 15–21, 24–30, 33–41,
44–46, and 48–68 (Figure 3). The EPR studies in this work help explain some of
the previous mutagenesis studies on the Ure2 protein. Jiang et al.41 showed that the deletion of residues 1–41
completely abolished the amyloid formation of Ure2 in vitro, and the
deletion of 15–41 also dramatically reduced the rate of aggregation.
In vivo, residues 2–44 were shown to be important for prion
induction and curing.42 These studies suggest
that the minimal region for the formation of the Ure2 fibril core
covers the first four β-strands: 8–11, 15–21,
24–30, and 33–41. Meanwhile, the deletion of residues
2–8 shows little effect on the curing ability of the Ure2 prion
domain, while the deletion of residues 2–10 dramatically reduces
the curing effect,42 suggesting that the
formation of the first β-strand at residues 8–11 is critical
for the amyloid formation of the Ure2 prion domain. A point mutation
in the first β-strand, V9C, has been shown to slow down the
aggregation of Ure2, supporting the critical role of this N-terminal
strand in Ure2 fibrillization.43

A special feature of amyloid fibrils is polymorphism. Unlike globular
proteins, whose most stable structures consist of mostly a single
conformation, amyloid fibrils can adopt multiple confirmations. Polymorphic
fibril structures may be the basis for yeast prion strains. In structural
studies, there is a concern on how fibril polymorphism may affect
our EPR analysis. In this work, we prepared Ure2 fibrils all at 37
°C under quiescent conditions, controlling two important variables
(temperature and agitation) that may affect fibril polymorphism. In
addition, EPR spectra are sensitive to heterogeneity in the sample.
Therefore, the EPR data themselves are indicators of the extent of
fibril polymorphism. To illustrate this point, we showed a mixing
of two EPR spectra: one with a strong spin–exchange interaction
(spin–exchange frequency of 200 MHz) and another with a weak
spin–exchange interaction (spin–exchange frequency of
50 MHz), at various ratios (Figure 7). The characteristic of the strong spin–exchange
interaction is a completely smoothed-out single-line spectrum, and
no apparent bumps are observed at the left shoulder of the center
peak. If there are two structural polymorphs of Ure2 at equal populations—one
gives a strong spin–exchange interaction and the other gives
a weak spin–exchange interaction—then it is easy to
detect the existence of such a mixture (Figure 7). Therefore, when an EPR spectrum of a strong
spin–exchange interaction is observed, it can be safely concluded
that the majority of the structure at the labeling site is homogeneous.
The same can be said for an EPR spectrum of a weak spin–exchange
interaction. It can be ambiguous when an EPR spectrum representing
spin–exchange interactions of intermediate strength is observed.
Based on the abundance of EPR spectra corresponding to strong spin–exchange
interactions (Figure 2), we believe that a major homogeneous fibril polymorph dominates
the fibril samples of this study. However, we acknowledge that this
analysis is solely based on the spin–exchange interactions
at each labeling site, and polymorphism may still exist at the level
of tertiary folding of β-strands and protofilament packing.
Future experiments, such as yeast prion assays, may help provide a
more stringent test on the formation of different prion strains from
these spin-labeled fibrils.

Figure 7 EPR spectra with two spectral components of
strong and weak spin–exchange interactions at various ratios.
The EPR spectrum of the strong spin–exchange interaction is
simulated using a spin–exchange frequency of 200 MHz and for
the weak spin–exchange interaction using 50 MHz.

One common feature of yeast prion domains is the enrichment
of glutamine and asparagine residues. Therefore, the driving force
of aggregation for the prion domain appears to be polar interactions.
Particularly, the formation of glutamine and asparagine ladders has
been proposed as a major stabilizing interaction in prion fibrils.44,45 In the first 80 residues of Ure2 protein, 33 are asparagines and
5 are glutamines. Particularly, residues 44–57 have the sequence
NNNNNNNSSSNNNN, in which 79% of the residues are asparagine. Previously,
a solid-state NMR study suggested that this stretch may be disordered
in the Ure2 fibrils.23 Here, the EPR data
show strong spin–exchange interactions for all residue positions
with the exception of 47, suggesting that this stretch of residues
adopts β-sheet structures. Consistent with our findings, the
asparagine ladder has been found to be a stabilizing feature in β-helix
proteins.44,46 Poly-asparagine peptides have been shown
to form amyloid fibrils readily.47

The role of charged residues has been thought to be destabilizing
in amyloid fibrils. In a previous modeling work of Ure2 fibrils, the
charged residues were deliberately placed at turns.48 There are 8 charged residues in the 1–80 region,
and these residues are R17, R24, D31, E38, R65, D72, E74, and K78.
Within the amyloid core of 8–68, strong spin–exchange
interactions at residues R17, R24, E38, and R65 suggest that they
adopt β-strand structures. D31 has a weaker spin–exchange
interaction and is next to Q32, which also has a weaker spin–exchange
interaction. Therefore, we assigned D31 to a turn structure. Three
charged residues, D72, E74, and K78, are located outside the amyloid
core. These three charged residues account for 25% of the 12-residue
stretch from residue 69 to 80, suggesting that the higher density
of charged residues may underlie the poor packing of this region in
the Ure2 fibrils. We would also like to point out a caveat of our
analysis. When we replace a charged residue with the spin label, the
charged residue no longer exists at that residue position. Our assumption
is that the replacement of the charged residue does not change the
overall structure of the Ure2 fibrils. Therefore, we assume that the
EPR spectrum represents the local structure of the charged residue
position. Our analysis is also aided by considering the neighboring
positions of these charged residues. If the charged residues are located
on turns, the turn structure would likely weaken the spin–exchange
interaction at its neighboring sites. This is based on the observation
that a turn typically consists of two residues or more with weaker
spin–exchange interactions, although a single residue can show
a non-β structure with little effect on adjacent residues (e.g.,
G42 and D47). For R17, the neighboring mutations L16R1 and Q18R1 both
give strong spin–exchange interactions. Furthermore, the EPR
spectral lineshapes of A15R1, L16R1, Q18R1, V19R1, N20R1, and I21R1
are very similar, suggesting that their EPR spectra reflect the backbone
feature of this region. For R24, N25R1 has a strong spin–exchange
interaction, but G22R1 and N23R1 have weak spin–exchange interactions,
and these two residues are assigned to a turn structure. Therefore,
it is likely that R24 is also part of this turn structure. For E38,
N36R1 and F37R1 are on one side of the β-sheet, while F39R1
and S40R1 are on the other side: all have relatively strong spin–exchange
interactions, suggesting that E38 is located in the middle of a β-strand.
R65 has a similar situation as E38. The neighboring residues on both
sides have similar EPR lineshapes and relatively strong interactions,
suggesting that R65 is located in the middle of a β-strand.

There are 12 hydrophobic amino acids in the region 1–80, and
these residues are V9, L12, A15, L16, V19, I21, I35, F37, F39, V43,
V58, and I77. Most of these hydrophobic residues are branched or aromatic
and are located on β-strands. This is consistent with the β-sheet
propensity of these residue types.49 I77
is located outside the amyloid core. Residues I35, F37, and F39 point
to the same side of the β-strand (consisting of residues 33–41),
likely providing strong hydrophobic interactions with their stacking
in the β-sheet. Similarly, A15, V19, and I21 also point to the
same side of the β-strand (consisting of residues 15–21,
with an arginine at position 17), and their stacking in the β-sheet
may also stabilize the Ure2 fibril through hydrophobic interactions.

Overall, the structure of Ure2 fibrils appears to involve a balance
of stabilizing interactions, both polar and hydrophobic, and destabilizing
interactions from stacking of charged residues (Figure 8). Such a balance may be important both for
maintaining the solubility of the Ure2 protein to perform its gene
regulation activity and for the strong aggregation propensity to form
prions.

Figure 8 A schematic model showing likely locations of β-strands and
turns in Ure2 fibrils. Block arrows represent likely β-strands
or ordered turns, consisting of residues with strong spin–exchange
interactions, as shown in Figure 3. Charged residues are colored in red, and hydrophobic
residues are colored in blue. Note that the long β-strand of
residues 48–68 likely involves highly ordered turns, which
were not distinguishable in our EPR analysis.

Experimental
Procedures
Ure2 Protein Purification and Spin Labeling
The construct
of the Ure2 prion domain used in this work is a fusion protein consisting
of residues 1–89 of the Ure2 protein and the M domain (residues
125–253) of the yeast prion protein Sup35.38 This construct has been designated as Ure2p1–89–M in our previous work.25,26,50 Single cysteine mutations were introduced at every
residue position from residue 2 to 80 using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The EPR spectra at labeling sites 2–15
were taken from a previous study26 and
re-analyzed together with the rest of the mutants. All other previously
reported mutants25,26 were re-purified and labeled
together with newly made mutants. Protein expression and purification
was performed as previously described25 with some modifications. Briefly, each Ure2 mutant was transformed
into E. coli C41 (DE3) cells (Lucigen)
for expression. The cells were collected using centrifugation and
then resuspended in PSU buffer (50 mM phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 8 M urea;
pH 10.0). The cells were sonicated and the cell debris was removed
with centrifugation. The supernatant was then loaded on a 5 mL HisTrap
column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a PSU buffer. Proteins were
eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (50–500 mM). The protein
concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction
coefficient of 6970 M–1 cm–1.51

For spin labeling, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
was added to the Ure2 solution at 10 mM and the mixture was incubated
at room temperature for 20 min. Then, the sample was buffer exchanged
to the spin-labeling buffer (20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid, 7 M guanidine hydrochloride, pH 6.8) with a HiTrap desalting
column (GE Healthcare). Immediately after buffer exchange, MTSSL,
(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate
(Enzo Life Sciences), was added at a 10-fold molar excess. Spin labeling
was performed at room temperature for 1 h on a nutating mixer. The
sample was then buffer exchanged to 30 mM ammonium acetate (pH 10.0),
lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C.

Fibril Preparation
To prepare spin-labeled Ure2 fibrils, one tube of spin-labeled
Ure2 mutant protein powder was dissolved in PG buffer (15 mM sodium
phosphate, 7 M guanidine hydrochloride; pH 6.8) to a concentration
of 1 mM. Then, the Ure2 sample was diluted 20-fold with PBS buffer
(50 mM sodium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl; pH 7.4). The sample was then
incubated at room temperature (∼22 °C) for approximately
5–10 days. The fibril formation was monitored with thioflavin
T fluorescence. When thioflavin T fluorescence reached plateau, the
fibrils were pelleted with centrifugation at 20,000g for 20 min and then surface-washed with the PBS buffer.

EPR Spectroscopy
and Spectral Simulation
For EPR studies, the spin-labeled
Ure2 fibrils were loaded in glass capillaries (VitroCom) sealed at
one end. EPR spectroscopy was performed at an X-band frequency on
a Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with the ER4102ST cavity at room
temperature using a microwave power of 20 mW. The modulation amplitude
was optimized to the natural linewidth of each individual spectrum
and was typically set at 4 G.

To quantify the strength of spin–exchange
interactions in the Ure2 fibrils, the EPR spectra were simulated using
the MultiComponent program, which is written by Dr. Christian Altenbach
at the University of California, Los Angeles, and can be freely downloaded
from the website of Dr. Wayne Hubbell’s research group.52 The EPR spectra at labeling positions 2–15
were previously published in Ngo et al.26 but were simulated again here to ensure consistency in the spectral
fitting across all spectra. A microscopic order, macroscopic disorder
model53 was used to describe the motion
of the spin label. For all the fits, the magnetic tensor A and g were set as Axx = 6.2, Ayy = 5.9, Azz =
37.0, and gxx = 2.0078, gyy = 2.0058, gzz = 2.0023, as described previously.54 An anisotropic model of motion was used for
R1 by including an order parameter (S). For anisotropic
simulations, the diffusion tilt angles were fixed to (α, β,
γ) = (0, 36°, 0) for the z-axis anisotropy,
as previously described.54 Only three parameters
were allowed to vary during the spectral fitting: the rotational diffusion
constant, order parameter, and Heisenberg exchange frequency. The
Heisenberg spin–exchange interaction as integrated in the MultiComponent
program describes interactions between multiple spins, not just two
spin labels. For the EPR spectra at residues 2–7 and 66–80,
a second spectral component without spin–exchange interactions
was used to account for a disordered structural state. An isotropic
model of motion was used for the second spectral component. The two
spectral components for residues 2–7 and 66–80 are shown
in Figure 5A. The percentage
of the disordered component is shown in Figure 5B. Only one spectral component was used for
the simulations of all other EPR spectra, and the best fits for all
spectra are shown in Figure 2. All the fitted parameters are shown in Table S1.

Seeded Aggregation Kinetics
A Ure2
stock solution was prepared by dissolving one tube of lyophilized
Ure2 powder in the PG buffer to 100 μM concentration. For the
seeded aggregation, 2.5 μL of the Ure2 stock was mixed with
37.5 μL of PBS, 5 μL of thioflavin T (500 μM), and
5 μL of sonicated Ure2 fibril seeds (5 μM). For the non-seeded
aggregation, 2.5 μL of the Ure2 stock solution was mixed with
42.5 μL of PBS and 5 μL of thioflavin T (500 μM).
Four repeats of each condition were prepared. To initiate aggregation,
all 50 μL of the aggregation samples was transferred to a black
384-well nonbinding surface microplate with a clear bottom (Corning
product# 3655) and sealed with a sealing film (Corning product# PCR-SP).
The microplate was then put in a Victor 3V plate reader (PerkinElmer)
and incubated at 37 °C without agitation. The thioflavin T fluorescence
was measured through the bottom of the plate approximately every 5
min with an excitation filter of 450 nm and emission filter of 490
nm. Ure2 fibril seeds were prepared by sonication of a pre-formed
Ure2 fibril sample (5 μM) for 200 s using a Branson Digital
Sonifier model 450 (microtip, 10% amplitude) with intermittent pause
to avoid overheating.
