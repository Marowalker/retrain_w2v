Surfactants
are functional molecules comprising a water-compatible
head group and a hydrophobic tail. One of their features is the formation
of self-assembled structures in contact with water, for instance,
micelles, vesicles, or lyotropic liquid crystals. One way to increase
the functionality of surfactants is to implement moieties containing
transition-metal species. Ferrocene-based surfactants represent an
excellent example because of the distinguished redox features. In
most existing ferrocene-based amphiphiles, an alkyl chain is classically
used as the hydrophobic tail. We report the synthesis and properties
of 1-triisopropylsilylethynyl-1′-trimethylammoniummethylferrocene
(FcNMe3TIPS). In FcNMe3TIPS, ferrocene is part
of the head group (Gemini design) but is also attached to a (protected)
π-conjugated ethynyl group. Although this architecture differs
from that of classical amphiphiles and those of other ferrocene-based
amphiphiles, the compound shows marked surfactant properties comparable
to those of lipids, exhibiting a very low value of critical aggregation
concentration in water (cac = 0.03 mM). It forms classical micelles
only in a very narrow concentration range, which then convert into
monolayer vesicles. Unlike classical surfactants, aggregates already
form at a very low concentration, far beneath that required for the
formation of a monolayer at the air–water interface. At even
higher concentration, FcNMe3TIPS forms lyotropic liquid
crystals, not only in contact with water, but also in a variety of
organic solvents. As an additional intriguing feature, FcNMe3TIPS is amenable to a range of further modification reactions. The
TIPS group is easily cleaved, and the resulting ethynyl function can
be used to construct heterobimetallic platinum-ferrocene conjugates
with trans-Pt(PEt3)2X (X =
Cl, I) complex entities, leading to a heterobimetallic surfactant.
We also found that the benzylic α-position of FcNMe3TIPS is rather reactive and that the attached ammonium group can
be exchanged by other substituents (e.g., −CN), which offers
additional opportunities for further functionalization. Although FcNMe3TIPS is reversibly oxidized in voltammetric and UV–vis
spectroelectrochemical experiments, the high reactivity at the α-position
is also responsible for the instability of the corresponding ferrocenium
ion, leading to a polymerization reaction.

Introduction
Surfactants are highly
important, functional molecules comprising
a water-compatible head group and a hydrophobic tail. They are produced
by the chemical industry on a mass scale (≈1.6 × 107 t/year) and used in detergents, as emulsification agents,
or for phase-transfer catalysis. Their main property is that they
reduce the interfacial energy (note that the term “surfactant”
represents an abbreviation for “surface-active agent”).
One of their most important features is the formation of concentration-dependent,
self-assembled structures in contact with water, ranging from micelles
or vesicles at low concentrations to lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs)
and inverse phases at higher concentrations. The classical design
of a surfactant molecule comprises a water-soluble head group attached
to a hydrophobic alkyl tail. The properties and behavior of surfactants
strongly depend on the relative proportions of the hydrophilic and
oleophilic parts. Concepts like the packing parameter P or the hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) have been developed
to describe the influence of such molecular variations.1−3 For instance, a surfactant equipped with two alkyl chains often
has lipid-like character. Compounds with two head groups at the opposite
sides of a long hydrophobic chain are called bolaform surfactants.4 An alternative structure is the so-called gemini
architecture with the two heads separated by a relatively short spacer.5 Because of their special properties, several
researchers became interested in asymmetric gemini surfactants.6−8

More recently, the portfolio of surfactants was successfully
expanded
by introducing additional properties such as pH-, CO2-,
photo-, magneto-, or thermoresponsive features.9 Excellent reviews on this topic are available from Eastoe
et al. in 2013 or Landfester et al. in 2017.10,11 A particularly powerful approach in the literature is the generation
of hybrid surfactants containing an inorganic, transition-metal-containing
building block.12 One of the most valuable
features of such moieties is their rich redox chemistry. The reversible
change of head group charge is an intriguing feature for a surfactant
system,13,14 and this requires a redox-active constituent.

Among redox-active building blocks, ferrocene (Fc) has proven to
be of eminent importance. Ferrocene is a unique organometallic compound
and the prototypical metallocene in modern chemistry.15−17 It is famous for its efficient methods of synthesis and derivatization,
its completely reversible redox properties, and its oxidation state-dependent
water solubility.18−21 Therefore, ferrocene has been widely used in materials science,
in particular in polymer chemistry.22 Amphiphilic
copolymers are well known and feature mostly a poly(vinylferrocene)
or a poly(ferrocenylsilane) backbone and water solubility-mediating
groups. The latter are either incorporated into the backbone or attached
to the numerous side chains.23−25 Various new synthetic procedures
have been developed during the recent years, for instance, by Manners
et al. or Wurm et al., who provided expanded libraries of polymer-like
ferrocene-based amphiphiles with high potential for future applications,
for example, in separation methods or for reducing the overall surfactant
waste during industrial processes.26−28 A good overview over
ferrocene-based surfactants was provided by Abbot et al.29 The field of ferrocene-modified amphiphiles
was pioneered by Saji in the late 1980s,30−32 and several
related surfactants have been published since then.33−36 Most of these involve monosubstituted
ferrocene derivatives. Because pristine ferrocene is insoluble in
water, it is often positioned at the end of the hydrophobic tail.
The approach presented by Saji is unique because it solved the latter
problem by positioning Fc next to an ammonium group modified by a
long alkyl chain in (Fc-CH2)(CH3)2N+(C12H25). The authors reported
the redox properties and some preliminary characterization of its
colloidal properties, including the formation and redox-triggered
disassembly of micelles in water.30−32

The systems described
above can be developed further by considering
the following arguments. Many applications involving surfactants would
greatly benefit from charge carrier (electron or hole) transport through
the interface, and new perspectives such as micellar batteries, micellar
electrocatalysts, or liquid-crystalline semiconductors would open
up for such systems.37,38 Classical surfactants are useless
for such purposes, not only because their heads are not redox-active
but also because their tails are electrically insulating as well.
Ferrocenyl-based head groups represent a promising entry point to
charge-conducting surfactants if an additional π-conjugated
chain can be introduced into the molecule instead of an alkyl chain.
However, in a design analogous to the surfactant by Saji, delocalization
of charge carriers would be impeded because the ammonium group interrupts
the conjugation between the ferrocene and an N-bonded π-conjugated
side chain. Therefore, we aim at ferrocene-based surfactants where
a π-conjugated substituent is directly attached to a cyclopentadienide
ring at the ferrocene nucleus, leading to a π-conjugation over
the entire molecule. We here present FcNMe3TIPS (see Scheme 1) as a first successful
realization of this concept. As a further advantage, FcNMe3TIPS can be modified in several different ways. Thus, it represents
a potential building block for the construction of more complex amphiphilic
structures. We describe the synthesis and characterization of FcNMe3TIPS and report on its properties as a surfactant and its
redox behavior. Finally, we report first results on exploring possible
means for modifying its basic structure.

Scheme 1 Multistep Synthesis
of FcNMe3TIPS
Results and Discussion
Molecular Synthesis and Characterization
FcNMe3TIPS was prepared in five steps starting from
ferrocene (Scheme 1). 1,1′-Dibromoferrocene
(2) was obtained as reported by Long and co-workers.39 It was then converted to 1-bromo-1′-iodoferrocene
(3) according to the procedure of Ilyashenko and co-workers.40 Standard Sonogashira reaction conditions were
used to selectively react 1-bromo-1′-iodoferrocene to the 1′-triisopropylsilylethynyl
(TIPSA)-substituted derivative (4). Subsequent conversion
to 1-triisopropylsilylethynyl-1′-dimethylaminomethylferrocene
(5) was performed according to a known procedure published
by Widhalm et al. using n-BuLi and Eschenmoser’s
salt Me2N=CH2+I– under Mannich-like conditions.41 Quaternization
with methyl iodide in MeOH yielded FcNMe3TIPS (6).42 Successful synthesis of FcNMe3TIPS was proven by a combination of analytical methods. A
section of its electrospray ionization mass spectrum (ESIMS) is shown
in Figure 1 (for the
full spectrum, see Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information). The observed signal at 438.2 g/mol and its isotope pattern
are in perfect agreement with the calculated pattern for the M+ peak C25H40FeNSi+. The presence
of the triple bond is confirmed by the characteristic stretching vibration
νC≡C at 2147 cm–1 in the
IR spectrum, in the typical region for internal alkynes.43

Solution UV–vis absorption spectra show an intense
absorption
band at λmax = 230 nm and a weaker band in the vis
region at 400–500 nm (λmax = 443 nm). The
latter is characteristic for the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital transition of ferrocene derivatives and
is responsible for their typical orange coloration (see Figure 2a).44 The density functional theory (DFT)-calculated frontier MOs of FcNMe3TIPS are shown in Figure S2 of
the Supporting Information.

structure (including its rigid alkyne functionality) and the calculated

air/foam at the interface).

Surfactant Properties of FcNMe3TIPS
FcNMe3TIPS is slightly soluble in water (0.5 mg/mL) as defined by
the United States Pharmacopeia and soluble in nonpolar solvents such
as dichloromethane (DCM) (60 mg/mL), which is a first indication for
amphiphilic properties. In water, the surfactant exhibits a significant
foaming capability (see Figure 2a), a characteristic feature of surfactants. The calculation
of the electrostatic potential surface of FcNMe3TIPS (Figure 2b) confirms a surfactant-like
architecture and shows that all molecular parts except for the ammonium
head group are nonpolar. Concentration-dependent surface tension (γ)
measurements in water were performed next (Figure 2c).

It was found that γ remains
constant until a concentration of c = 0.007 mM is
reached and then decreases. Saturation of the air–water interface
is observed at c = 0.79 mM with a minimal surface
tension γmin = 28.5 mN/m. This value is lower than
those of other ferrocene-based amphiphiles in the literature (γmin = 35–55 mN/m),9,33,35,45−48 which indicates a very effective
stabilization of the interface and a close packing of the surfactant
molecules. The surface tension curve can be treated as a Gibbs isotherm,
and the surface excess (Γ = 3.90 μmol/m2) and
the average area occupied per molecule at the water–air interface
(Am = 43 Å2) were calculated. Am fits perfectly the distance between the trimethylammonium
head group and the ferrocene at the water–air interface as
determined from the calculated, geometry-optimized structure (Figure 2d; see also the Supporting
Information Figure S3b). Classical surfactants
start to form micelles only when the interface is covered by a surfactant
monolayer. We checked the occurrence of aggregates in solution by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) recorded for different concentrations
ranging from c = 0.014 to 0.88 mM (Figure 3). Even at low concentrations,
aggregates could be detected with a hydrodynamic diameter DH (≈5 nm), which is in the range expected
for micelles (approx. twice the molecular length of the surfactant).
However, the aggregate size increases almost linearly with surfactant
concentration (Figure 3b). Such behavior cannot anymore be explained by the presence of
micellar aggregates.

DLS measurements
in aqueous solution of FcNMe3TIPS at c = 0.014 mM (black), 0.22 mM (red), and 0.88 mM (blue). (b) Correlation
of the hydrodynamic diameter DH with surfactant
concentration.

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was performed next (Figure 4a). In agreement
with the DLS data, one notes objects in a size range 100–200
nm separated by a thin membrane. The thickness of the membrane is
≈3 nm, which matches with a double-layer structure composed
of molecules of FcNMe3TIPS, and these findings can be supported
by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), powder X-ray diffraction,
and other TEM micrographs displayed in Figure S3a of the Supporting Information.

(EDX) data; Cu signals from the TEM grid.

Figure 5 Alternative determination of the cac. Absorption of azobenzene
in the cyclohexane phase at different concentrations of the surfactant
in the aqueous phase.

This surfactant has a tendency for the formation of vesicular
structures.
The vesicles appear to be broken up caused by the high-vacuum conditions
in electron microscopy. Area-selected energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) confirms the presence of Fe (from Fc) and Si (from the TIPS
end group) (Figure 4b) and the signals for iodine originating from the I– counterion (see Scheme 1). According to the theory of Israelachvili, surfactants with
a packing parameter in the range 0.5–1 are prone to form vesicles
instead of micelles.1 The packing parameter P = 0.87 of FcNMe3TIPS is in full agreement with
this expectation (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3b). Vesicle formation is a rather uncommon feature
among ferrocene-based amphiphiles known in the literature.35,36

However, when comparing Figures 2 and 3, one has to
conclude
that aggregates form in solution prior to saturation of the air–water
interface. This means that the concentration at γmin does not equal the critical aggregation concentration (cac). Therefore,
an independent method for the determination of the cac was required.
To these ends, FcNMe3TIPS was dissolved in water at different
concentrations. The aqueous phase was then layered with n-hexane containing the lipophilic dye azobenzene (see also Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). The
optical absorbance of the dye in the oil phase was determined at λ
= 316 and 228 nm by UV–vis spectroscopy. At low concentration
of the surfactant, the concentration of the dye remains constant (Figure 5). Starting at an
FcNMe3TIPS concentration of ≈0.01 mM, some azobenzene
moves into the aqueous phase, and, as a result, the measured absorption
in the oil phase decreases. The concentration of 0.01 mM is identical
to that for which we have observed the occurrence of micelles (Figure 3b). Therefore, it
can be concluded that azobenzene-loaded micelles are present in water.
Surprisingly, a minimum is reached at c = 0.03 mM,
and on increasing the concentration further, the absorption increases
again to the original value. In agreement with DLS and TEM (Figures 3 and 4), we explain this behavior by the transition from a micellar
state to the vesicular state. Because the inner cavity of the vesicles
is also filled with water, azobenzene cannot enter the water phase
anymore. This means that the cac (≅the concentration at which
the first aggregates form in solution) is very low (at ≈0.01
mM) and that the shape transition commences at a concentration of
≈0.03 mM. Classic surfactants like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
and sodium dodecyl sulfate have a significantly higher cac value of
0.92–1 and 6–8 mM, respectively,49−51 while the cac
of ferrocene-based amphiphiles as they were, for instance, explored
by Saji and co-workers is usually in the range of 0.1–2 mM.30,48,52,53 In contrast, lipids have typically much lower cac’s in the
nM region. The cac of FcNMe3TIPS is thus in between those
of lipids and classic surfactants.54,55

Thus,
the formation of aggregates commences even before a monolayer
is formed at the air–water interface. This unusual behavior
can be explained by the peculiar structure of FcNMe3TIPS.
The rigid alkyne functionality reduces the flexibility of the overall
amphiphile and the possibilities of how the amphiphiles can arrange
at the water–air interface. According to Figure 2d, a close packing of molecules of FcNMe3TIPS leads to an energetic destabilization of the Gibbs monolayer.
Notably, the close proximity of the positive charges at the trimethylammonium
head groups results in strong Coulombic repulsion. Therefore, the
formation of aggregates with a certain degree of curvature (micelles,
vesicles) and an increased distance between the positive charges might
be energetically favored, thereby decreasing the prevalent charge
repulsion, instead of forming a closely packed Gibbs monolayer. Such
behavior has rarely been described in the literature but was reported
for conical ionic fullerene amphiphiles following the image charge
theory by Nitta and co-workers.51,56,57 Our arguments are also supported by comparison to similar structures
as our surfactant, but with alkyl chains.29 Those compounds have a higher average surface tension (γmin = 35–55 mN/m), and the overall surface activity
is reduced. This can be explained by the higher space required by
the flexible alkyl chains at the air–water interface.

A surfactant is expected to form lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs)
at higher concentration. We therefore also examined the phases of
FcNMe3TIPS formed at high concentration levels in different
solvents (water, acetonitrile, a mixture of acetonitrile and isopropanol
as well as in apolar solvents like dichloromethane). There are only
few reports on LLCs with ferrocene-based amphiphiles.58,59 Because many LLC phases are optically anisotropic, polarized optical
microscopy (POLMIC) is a convenient method to observe LLCs. POLMIC
images show that FcNMe3TIPS forms LLC phases not only in
polar solvents but also in nonpolar solvents (see Figure 6a and the Supporting Information Figure S5). Maltese-cross patterns (columnar
droplets), giant mosaiclike LLCs, and fanlike textures were observed
in polar and apolar solvents, indicating the presence of LLCs in the
circular/lamellar and the smectic phase, respectively.60−62 Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveals a signal at a scattering
vector q = 2.21 nm–1 corresponding
to a lattice plane spacing of d = 2.84 nm. The distance
of 2.84 nm equals twice the length of the ferrocene amphiphile as
estimated from the geometry-optimized, calculated structure and indicates
an end-to-end orientation of the triisopropylsilylethynyl lipophilic
tails.

Functionalization of FcNMe3TIPS and Redox Properties
As it was mentioned before,
the new surfactant FcNMe3TIPS has the potential advantage
that it can be modified further
such as to endow it with even superior levels of functionality. The
most attractive position for such modification is obviously the TIPS-protected
ethynyl end group. The TIPS group is easily cleaved from (5) using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (Scheme 2). The resulting H-terminated alkyne (7) is now amenable to a wide range of further functionalizations.
For proof of concept, the square-planar platinum fragment trans-Pt(PEt3)2Cl was attached to
(7) to give the neutral complex (8). The
latter was converted to the heterobimetallic surfactant (9) by subsequent quaternization of the amine function with concomitant
substitution of the chloro by an iodo ligand at the platinum ion.
The success of these reactions was unambiguously proven by NMR spectroscopy
(see the Experimental Section and Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). Two-dimensional
(2D) NMR spectroscopic investigations confirmed the purity of complexes
(8) and (9). In particular, Pt satellites
for the ethynyl-carbon atoms of (9) were observed in
its 13C NMR spectrum. The triplet at −4823 ppm (JPtP = 2337 Hz) in the 195Pt NMR spectrum
indicates the formation of a trans-Pt(PEt3)2I(−C≡CR) fragment, while the 31P NMR spectrum accordingly shows a singlet at 8.57 ppm with Pt satellites
with an identical JPtP = 2337 Hz.

Scheme 2 Preparation of a New Heterobimetallic Surfactant
According to the report of Lindsay et al.,42 it should also be possible to exchange the ammonium
group in α-position
to the ferrocene ring by nucleophiles. We adapted the procedure according
to Scheme 3 and obtained
the corresponding nitrile compound (10). The 1H NMR spectrum shown in Figure S7 proves
the upfield shift of the resonance signal for the methylene protons
in α-position upon substitution of the trimethylammonium group by
the nucleophile cyanide and underlines the successful synthesis of
FcCNTIPS (10). Compound (10) itself can
be further functionalized to the respective carboxamides, the carboxylic
acid, or to amines.

Scheme 3 Nucleophilic Attack at the Ammonium Group
An important feature of ferrocene-based
amphiphiles is their reversible
one-electron oxidation to the corresponding ferrocenium species (Fc+). In the case of FcNMe3TIPS, the charge of the
surfactant increases from +1 to +2. More importantly, the formerly
neutral ferrocene nucleus changes to cationic ferrocenium and hence
may become a part of the hydrophilic head as opposed to the oleophilic
part of the molecule (c. f. Figure 2b). Both effects should cause a major change of the
packing parameter P. We first investigated the redox
properties of the iodide salt of the cationic FcNMe3TIPS
surfactant by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information, CVs recorded in dichloromethane
(DCM) show three consecutive redox waves. Comparison with tetrabutylammonium
iodide indicates that the first two processes at E = −165 and 88 mV are due to the I–/I3–/I2 redox couples63,64 and that the most anodic wave at a half-wave potential E1/2 of 332 mV is assignable to the Fc/Fc+ redox
couple. To avoid this interference, the iodide counterions were replaced
by nitrate using an ion-exchange resin, and the corresponding nitrate
salt was used further on in the electrochemical investigations. The
latter showed only the reversible Fc/Fc+ couple at an E1/2 of 332 mV (see Figure 7a) in organic solvents. In water as
the solvent, oxidized FcNMe3TIPS is obviously immobilized
at the electrode surface as revealed by the typical, sharp and nondiffusive
anodic adsorption peak. The presence of a normal diffusion-controlled
reverse peak on the cathodic scan suggests that oxidized FcNMe3TIPS is chemically (at least partially) stable on the short
CV time scale.

M NBu4PF6 (a) and in water (b). Repetitive scans
of the
Fc/Fc+ wave in the presence of “magic blue”
(c), and changes in the UV–vis spectra on electrochemical oxidation
of FcNMe3TIPS (d).

More detailed investigations of the oxidation process using
UV–vis
spectroelectrochemistry (SEC, 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in
DCM) revealed a more complex behavior on longer time scales. When
employing a rather high overpotential to ensure rapid oxidation, the
vis band of the neutral compound at λmax = 443 nm
decreased upon oxidation and two new bands with similar or higher
intensity at λmax = 585 and 782 nm develop (Figure 4d). Both are typical
of ferrocenium species.65,66 Rapid rereduction at
likewise high overpotential reproduced the spectrum of the neutral
compound almost quantitatively (see Figure S9a). When, however, the electrolysis was conducted at a slower rate
and with a gradual, stepwise increase of the applied potential, no
ferrocenium formation was observed. Rather, a filming of the working
electrode was encountered (see Figure S9b). Chemical oxidation of the nitrate salt of FcNMe3TIPS
in a CV cell (0.1 M NBu4PF6 in DCM) using tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium
hexachloridoantimonate (magic blue) as the oxidizing agent67,68 (0.5 or 1 eq., respectively) likewise suggests rapid degradation
and polymerization, leading to the deposition of an insulating film
on to the electrode surface on repeated scanning (see Figure 7c). In water as the
solvent, oxidized FcNMe3TIPS degrades at an even faster
rate. Thus, oxidizing FcNMe3TIPS with dropwise addition
of an aqueous solution of cerium ammonium nitrate led to an instantaneous,
greenish-blue coloration and then to a rapid discoloration to pale
orange with the concomitant formation of a yellow-orange, insoluble
precipitate (see Figure S9c of the Supporting
Information for UV–vis data).

Scheme 4 offers
a possible explanation for these observations. Oxidation to the ferrocenium
ion is expected to increase the electrophilicity of the methylene
carbon, which links the ferrocene and the adjacent trimethylammonium
head group. The latter is now even more readily attacked by external
nucleophiles to release NMe3 or may attack a nearby, unoxidized
molecule of FcNMe3TIPS, most likely at the more electron-rich
TIPS–C≡C-substituted Cp ring (note that ferrocenes are
by a factor of ca. 106 more reactive toward electrophiles
than benzene). The resulting methylene-bridged diferrocenium cation
with one oxidized and one reduced ferrocene unit might then undergo
homogeneous charge-transfer with yet another molecule of FcNMe3TIPS, thereby triggering an electrocatalytic process, or follow
reactions such as the substitution of the ammonium head group. We
note here again that nucleophilic substitution of the NMe3 leaving group of trimethylammoniummethylene-substituted ferrocenes
is a standard procedure for preparing Fc–CH2Nu derivatives
(Nu = OH, OR, CN, SR, etc.).36,41,42 Thus, substitution at the trimethylammonium head group offers another
way to further modify the surfactant properties of FcNMe3TIPS, and work along these lines is presently being pursued in our
laboratories.

Scheme 4 Redox-Triggered Polymerization of FcNMe3TIPS
Conclusions and Outlook
We present the synthesis of 1-triisopropylsilylethynyl-1′-trimethylammoniummethylferrocene
(FcNMe3TIPS). FcNMe3TIPS features a trimethylammonium
head group and an oleophilic part constituted by the ferrocene nucleus
and the attached TIPS-protected ethynyl functionality at the other
cyclopentadienide ring. This unusual architecture sets the title compound
apart from other ferrocene-based amphiphiles in the literature. FcNMe3TIPS has typical features of a surfactant and shows colloidal
behavior similar to lipids. It packs very efficiently at the air–water
interface, leading to a very low value of the minimum surface tension
(γmin = 28.5 mN/m). In agreement with its packing
parameter, it has a high tendency for the formation of vesicles instead
of micelles. The critical aggregation concentration was determined
by two independent methods. It could be confirmed that aggregates
are already present in solution at significantly lower concentrations
as required for the formation of a full monolayer at the air–water
interface. This behavior also differs from that of classical surfactants.

As an additional advantage, FcNMe3TIPS can be modified
in various different ways. We demonstrated that the protective TIPS
group is easily cleaved to yield complex 7 with an unprotected
ethynyl functionality (see Scheme 2). Complex 7 was then used to prepare
the heterobimetallic Fe–Pt complexes (8) and (9), where the ethynyl linker connects the ferrocenyl group
to a trans-configured Pt(PEt3)2Cl or Pt(PEt3)2I entity. The latter could endow
them also with additional catalytic function in addition to their
(as-yet unexplored) surfactant properties. Its terminal ethynyl functionality
makes 7 also an ideal precursor for the incorporation
of other functionalities, for example, via Sonogashira coupling or
click chemistry reactions. We also found that the terminal α-position
next to the aromatic system of Fc is highly reactive and can be transformed
by nucleophilic substitution. As expected, FcNMe3TIPS is
reversibly oxidized to the corresponding ferrocenium species at a
half-wave potential of 332 mV in CH2Cl2/NBu4PF6. In water, the corresponding redox process
is compromised by the strong adsorptive behavior of the ferrocenium
species. On a longer time scale, FcNMe3TIPS is chemically
reactive with the release of NMe3, which initiates a polymerization
reaction. Because the presence of the ammonium group is essential
for securing solubility and the function as a surfactant, we aim at
modifying this position, for example, by introducing an ethylene spacer
or by employing a different, charged head group, for example, a carboxylate,
in order to fully exploit the inherent redox activity of such ferrocene-based
gemini surfactants.

Ion-Exchange Procedure for Electrochemical
Investigations (FcNMe3TIPS_NO3)
First,
500 mg of the iodide
salt of FcNMe3TIPS (0.88 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of
MeOH and flushed through a plug of freshly activated, KNO3-loaded Amberlite IRA-402. This procedure was repeated 10 times,
and then the solvent was removed in vacuo, resulting in a yellow solid
with white impurities (KNO3). The precipitate was dissolved
in dichloromethane and washed two times with 30 mL of distilled water.
The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, and the solvent
was removed in vacuo. CV measurements confirmed the complete displacement
of I– by NO3–. The
ion-exchange proceeded quantitatively.

Characterization
NMR experiments were carried out on
a Varian Unity Inova 400, a Bruker Avance III DRX 400, or a Bruker
Avance DRX 600 spectrometer. 1H and 13C spectra
were referenced to the respective solvent signal, whereas 31P and 195Pt spectra were referenced to external standards
(85% H3PO4) and saturated K2[PtCl6] in D2O, respectively. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR
experiments were used to assign unequivocal signals. Numbering of
the nuclei can be seen in the Supporting Information in the respective NMR data. Combustion analysis was performed with
an Elementar vario MICRO cube CHN-analyzer from Heraeus. ESIMS data
were acquired on a Bruker microtof II system. Cyclic voltammetry was
performed in a one-compartment cell with 5–7 mL of DCM or deionized
water as the solvent and NBu4PF6 (0.1 M) or
KNO3 (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. A platinum
electrode (⌀ = 1.1 mm, BASI) was used in DCM and a glassy carbon
electrode (⌀ = 3 mm, BASI) in water as the working electrode.
A computer-controlled BASi EPSILON potentiostat was used for recording
of the voltammograms. A Ag/AgCl wire pseudoreference electrode in
DCM and a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode in water were used
in combination with a platinum wire auxiliary electrode. UV–vis
spectroelectrochemistry was performed in a self-built OTTLE cell according
to the design of Hartl et al.70 A platinum
grid as the working and counter electrode was welded in a polyethylene
spacer, incorporated into a Teflon surrounded with electrical connectors
in between the CaF2 plates of a liquid IR cell. Next, 0.1
M of NBu4PF6 in DCM was used as the supporting
electrolyte. IR/NIR spectra were recorded on an Fourier transform
infrared Bruker Tensor II instrument. UV–vis spectroscopy and
spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed on a diode-array
unit TIDAS by J&M ANALYTIK. In the latter experiments, a WENKING
potentiostat POS3 was used. Attenuated total reflection (ATR)-IR spectra
were measured on a Perkin Elmer 100 Spectrum Spectrometer equipped
with an ATR unit. DLS measurements were done on Malvern Zen5600. Liquid-crystal
pictures were performed with an Olympus CX41 light microscope. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were done on JEOL
JEM-2200FS. For surface tension measurements, Krüss K100 was
used. SAXS was acquired on a Bruker Nanostar system equipped with
pinhole collimation and Cu Kα radiation. Geometry optimization
and orbital calculations were performed using DFT with the TURBOMOLE
program package for ab initio electronic structure calculation using
the BP86/def2-TZVP level of theory. TURBOMOLE V7.1 2016, a development
