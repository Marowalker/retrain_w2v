Photoluminescence
of Eu3+ in DMSO is intense and ultrasensitive
to water, thereby providing a novel method for water detection. Herein,
for the first time, we investigated the effects of Eu3+ concentration on luminescence and developed a multiparameter method
for trace water detection based on a single luminescence agent. To
further extend its practical applications, we explored its performance
for water detection in ethanol and gasoline. Our findings demonstrate
that it is a sensitive and reliable probe for the detection of a wide
concentration range of water in ethanol (0–24.24%) and gasoline
(0–32.43%), making Eu–DMSO a promising candidate to
detect water in a wide concentration range. These phenomena not only
make Eu–DMSO a sensitive agent for in situ water detection
in real time but also provide scientifically interesting mechanisms
behind its application as a water sensing probe.

Introduction
Earth is the only place
that we know for sure supports life because
of the cozy temperature, plenty of water, and oxygen. As the earth
is becoming hotter, the earth might become inhabitable in the future.
As a result, humans may need to immigrate to other planets, such as
Mars. Scientists all over the world are looking for new habitable
planets, and determining the water content on the surface of the planets
is a crucial step to achieve this goal.

Water is not only an
extremely important part of life for all living
beings but it also plays a vital role in chemistry and industrial
processes. Despite its ubiquitous importance, water content plays
a detrimental role in many routine laboratory and industrial applications;
therefore, detecting and quantifying water content is of crucial importance
in chemical reactions and industrial processes.1 For example, the presence of water in organometallic reagents
may lead to fire and explosions under some conditions.1 Besides, water impurity adversely affects the yield and
selectivity of the final products in many chemical reactions, such
as the foods produced in photosynthesis.2,3 Furthermore,
the presence of water in petroleum-based fuels lowers the performance
of the engine. When the temperature is sufficiently low, emulsification
and phase separation may lead to damage and failure of the engine.1 As water can influence torque characteristics
and wear resistance, the trace amount of water in wet clutch systems
can be problematic.4 Moreover, the presence
of free water can cause corrosion and cavitation inside or throughout
the clutch systems, thereby leading to iron and lead corrosion. Additionally,
water can disturb the generation of friction modifying boundary film
on the friction interfaces. The presence of water also disrupts the
friction-increasing substances, including detergents and dispersants.
Furthermore, fibers can loosen from the diluted binder in the water-contained
lubricant, resulting in the degradation of the material. Studies have
found that 1000 ppm water in petroleum-based transmission and hydraulic
oils and in synthetic engine-lubricating oil can have a detrimental
effect.4 Premature oil change causes financial
burden and generates additional disposal costs, whereas changing oil
too late results in wear and possible engine failure. Therefore, knowledge
of the condition of the oil is necessary to replace it in a timely
manner.5 Accordingly, a probe that is suitable
for accurate, real-time, and in situ early detection of water contents
in oil is highly desirable.

The determination of the humidity
level in the atmosphere is vital
for human health. For example, joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis
are profoundly affected by temperature and humidity. In addition,
many industrial applications are substantially affected by trace water
content in ambient air. Therefore, monitoring trace water has been
a hot topic investigated extensively.5−13 There are some well-established techniques to estimate water content
in organic solvents, including Karl Fischer titration, chromatography,
and other spectroscopic techniques. Even though the Karl Fischer method14 can detect trace amounts of water up to the
ppm level, it has some limitations, such as involving toxic reagents,
specialized instruments, time-consuming, requiring well-trained personnel,
chemical interference, and complicated sample preparation, which limit
its application.15−17 Consequently, cost-effective, reliable, and highly
efficient alternative methods are required for the real-time and in
situ estimation of water in routine laboratory works and industrial
processes.

Fluorescent and colorimetric probes could be an alternative
option
to monitor water content, primarily in organic solvents and raw foods.
Since water is an effective quencher of luminescence, luminescent
probes for monitoring water content have been extensively studied
and developed.7−10,18,19 It has been reported that ratiometric fluorescence measurement method,
based on the ratio of the photoluminescence (PL) intensities of two
wavelengths, can be suitable for detecting analytes as this method
is independent of interference from the environment and eliminates
the most likely variabilities.20−22 Consequently, it is highly desirable
to develop an effective ratiometric probe that can respond to water
impurity in various organic solvents.

DMSO is miscible in many
solvents, such as water, ethanol, acetone,
ether, and chloroform, and is a solvent for unsaturated, nitrogen-containing,
and aromatic compounds,23−27 making it a versatile solvent to be used in a probe. Despite the
enormous potential of lanthanide–DMSO compounds to meet novel
applications, only a handful of studies have been performed to elucidate
and exploit its luminescence.18,19,26,28,29 Luminescence of rare earth in DMSO is a new phenomenon that has
been reported only recently and is still in its infancy.18,19,30 Consequently, more research on
DMSO-based luminescence water-detecting sensors needs to be conducted
to realize them in practical use.

In the present work, for the
first time, we explored the effect
of Eu3+ concentration on the luminescence of Eu–DMSO
samples and used the results to develop a multiparameter method for
trace water detection based on a single probe. Additionally, we attempted
to detect water content in ethanol and gasoline using the ratiometric
fluorescence measurement method, based on the ratio of the PL intensities
of two wavelengths (613 and 617 nm) of the same sample.

Results and Discussion
Effect
of Eu3+ Concentration on Photoluminescence
(PL) of Eu–DMSO
Eu–DMSO shows a strong red
photoluminescence (PL) upon UV exposure, as depicted in Figure 1 (left) for various concentrations
of Eu3+ (0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 M). The emission
spectra of all samples, when excited by 394 nm, are presented in Figure 1 (right). The sharp
and narrow emissions of the Eu3+ ion originate from f–f
transitions, and the emissions in the range of 575–725 nm are
attributed to 5D0–7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) transitions
of Eu3+.31

at different concentrations of Eu3+ (0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
and 0.5 M) under UV exposure. Right:
Emission spectra of different concentrations of Eu3+ in
Eu–DMSO.

As can be seen in Figure 1 (right), the PL intensity
of Eu3+ showed a gradual
increase with an increase in concentration and attained the highest
intensity at the concentration of 0.2 M, and then decreased gradually
with further increase in concentration (see inset in Figure 1 (right) for the emission of
617 nm). This result shows that 0.2 M is the optimum concentration
of Eu–DMSO, whereas it suffers from a concentration quenching
effect beyond 0.2 M.

The molecular structure of Eu–DMSO
is still unclear due
to the lack of extensive characterization as no crystals or precipitates
could be obtained from the solutions. Nevertheless, the luminescence
phenomenon may provide some critical information about the environments
of Eu3+ ions in the solution. In fact, the luminescence
spectroscopy of the europium ion has been exploited to elucidate the
structure of natural and synthetic compounds.32 The fact that 7F0 and 5D0 levels are nondegenerate, its number of components suggests the
number of different metal–ion sites.33−36 As shown in Figure 2 (left), the 5D0–7F0 emission is a single peak
in DMSO, indicating that Eu3+ ions occupy an equivalent
site. The 5D0–7F0 transition of Eu3+ is forbidden by both electric dipole
transitions (EDT) and magnetic dipole transition (MDT) mechanisms,
thereby resulting in very weak luminescence. It has also been reported
that the 5D0–7F0 transition normally appears when the site symmetry around europium
ion is very low and is generally seen for 10 site symmetries: Cs, C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, C2v, C3v, C4v, and C6v, based on the electric dipole selection
rule. In many phosphors, the emissions of 5D0–7F0 can be attributed to the presence
of oxygen in the crystals, which lowers the site symmetry of Eu3+ ions.37,38 Accordingly, it is reasonable
to believe that the occurrence of oxygen in DMSO is one likely reason
for the 5D0–7F0 emissions.

The inset shows the change in emission intensity at 579 nm with the
concentration of Eu3+ in Eu–DMSO. Right: Relationship
between intensity ratios of 592, 613, 617, 652, and 700 to 579 nm
emissions at different concentrations of Eu3+ in Eu–DMSO.

As displayed in Figure 2 (left), the intensities of the 5D0–7F0 emissions are dependent
on the concentration
of Eu3+ and followed a similar trend to f–f emissions,
as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). The luminescence intensity of the 5D0–7F0 transition increased with
the concentration of Eu3+ and reached the maximum at 0.2
M and then decreased with further increase in the concentration. The
change in the intensity ratios of the 5D0–7FJ (J = 1, 2,
3, and 4) transition to the 5D0–7F0 transition (i.e., 592/579, 613/579, 617/579,
652/579, and 700/579) with an increase in the Eu3+ concentration
is shown in Figure 2 (right). It is particularly interesting to observe that the trend
is similar for all of the transitions, suggesting the effects of concentration
are similar to all of the 5D0–7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3,
and 4) transitions.

The two peaks at 592 (5D0–7F1) and 615 nm (5D0–7F2) are ascribed to the
magnetic dipole and electric
dipole transitions, respectively. The strong peak at 615 nm, which
corresponds the 5D0 → 7F2 transition, can be attributed to the allowed electric dipole
transition with inversion antisymmetry.33−36 In our Eu–DMSO sample,
this emission (615 nm) splits into two components (613 and 617 nm),
which can be attributed to the splitting of the 7F2 level in a low-symmetry site. In theory, the 7F2 level splits into three crystal field levels of A1
and 2E with a low-symmetry site. Due to the close energy levels of
A1 and one of the two E levels, these energy levels can be overlapped
in the emission spectra, resulting in only two energy levels A1 and
E.39 Here, we assign the 613 nm emission
to A1 and the 617 nm emission to E.

The peak at 592 nm, which
corresponds to the 5D0 → 7F1 transition, is due to
the allowed magnetic dipole transition. According to the Laporte selection
rule (equal parity), if an Eu3+ ion is situated in a symmetry
center, the electric dipole transitions between the 4f6 levels are strictly forbidden, whereas the magnetic dipole transition
is still possible. On the other hand, the electric dipole transition
intensity should be stronger than the magnetic dipole transition intensity
in an asymmetric environment, as stated by the Judd–Ofelt theory.
The intensity at 615 nm (electric dipole transition) is stronger than
that at 592 nm (magnetic dipole transition), which signifies that
Eu3+ occupied sites have low inversion symmetry or asymmetric
environment. The intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 to 5D0 → 7F1 transitions (617/592 and 613/592 nm), called the symmetry
ratio, can provide information about the structural quality of the
material. As presented in Figure 3, the symmetry ratios of various Eu–DMSO samples
(0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M of Eu3+) are from 1.4 to 2.8,
suggesting a low inversion symmetry of Eu3+ sites. Notably,
the symmetry ratios (617/592 and 613/592 nm) enhanced with increasing
Eu3+ concentrations (Figure 3), most likely due to the increase in the symmetry
for the Eu3+-occupying sites.

a function of Eu3+ concentration in
Eu–DMSO.

FTIR, NMR Spectra, and
UV–Vis Absorption
To
elucidate the interaction of Eu3+ ions with DMSO and water,
FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and UV–vis absorption
spectra were acquired. Figures S1–S3 depict the FTIR spectra of DMSO alone, Eu–DMSO, and water-added
Eu–DMSO samples, respectively. As shown in Figure S1, the S=O stretch in pure DMSO sample appeared
at 1048 cm–1. This peak shifted to the lower wavenumber
of 1041 cm–1 in the Eu–DMSO sample (Figure S2), indicative of the oxygen atom of
DMSO in interaction with Eu3+ ions.40 Upon interaction, the S=O bond gets more polarized
to lose double-bond character, thus providing a lower energy transition
during infrared interaction.40 Furthermore,
the Eu–DMSO sample containing water relaxed the S=O
stretch to 1045 cm–1 (Figure S3). This is probably due to an increased interaction between
added water and Eu3+ ions, which competes with the DMSO
interaction with Eu3+ ions, thereby releasing more DMSO
in its native free state.

To further understand the interaction
of Eu3+ with DMSO, 1H NMR and 13C
NMR spectra were also collected. Figure S4 demonstrates the results of the 1H NMR spectra of Eu–DMSO
and DMSO alone. The results reveal that the proton signal of the methyl
group in DMSO appears as a singlet peak at δ 2.584 ppm. However,
in the Eu–DMSO sample, the same proton signal appears to shift
to the low-field region of δ 2.588 ppm. This minimal deshielding
effect could arise from the interaction between DMSO and Eu3+ ions through the S=O group of DMSO. A similar effect is observed
in the carbon signal, where the chemical shift value of carbon in
DMSO shifted to a low-field region in the Eu–DMSO sample (Figure 4). Upon the addition
of water in the Eu–DMSO sample, the carbon signal moves back
to the high-field region, potentially due to competitive interaction
between water and Eu3+ ions in the presence of water. Both
FTIR and NMR results show the interaction between DMSO and Eu3+ ions, although the exact mode of interaction or complexation
is currently not known.

comparison between
pure DMSO, Eu–DMSO sample, and Eu–DMSO + water sample

under identical instrumental conditions.

Figure 5 depicts
the UV–vis absorption spectra of the Eu–DMSO sample
after diluting with an equal volume of DMSO (left) and water (right).
As can be seen in Figure 5 (left), the absorption peak of the Eu–DMSO sample
at about 264 nm decreased after the gradual addition of DMSO, which
can be attributed to the dilution effect. On the other hand, as displayed
in Figure 5 (right),
after adding the same amount of water to the Eu–DMSO sample,
not only peak intensity decreased but also wavelength shifted. As
water is considered as a competitive agent for complexation in lanthanide
complexes,1 the peak wavelength shift after
diluting with water can be ascribed to the possible interaction of
water with Eu3+. The results of the UV–vis absorption
spectra are consistent with the results of the FTIR and NMR spectra.

Water Sensing in DMSO
As reported in our previous work,
the photoluminescence (PL) of the Eu–DMSO compound can be exploited
as a highly sensitive probe for water detection.19 Particularly, the emission corresponding to the 5D0–7F2 transition of Eu3+ in Eu–DMSO is ultrasensitive with water. Due to J-mixing in the crystal field expansion and the spin–orbit
interaction, the 5D0–7F2 transition band splits into two emission peaks (613 (A1)
and 617 nm (E)).41 When water was added
to the as-synthesized sample, the ratio of the intensities of 613
to 617 nm peaks (I613/I617) showed a remarkable change. Interestingly, the 617
nm peak suffered from a more rapid quenching effect than the 613 nm
peak in the presence of water. The quenching effect after adding water
can be ascribed to the loss of some energy of excited state of Eu3+ to O–H oscillators of water molecules.42 An alternative mechanism of fluorescence quenching
could be the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process.43,44 On the other hand, both 613 and 617 nm peaks showed similar quenching
effect with the addition of DMSO, which can simply be attributed to
the dilution of the sample.

The systematic changes in the two
emission peaks (613 and 617 nm) with water are shown in Figure 6 for the four samples with
Eu3+ concentrations of 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 M. For the
original samples, the emission at 617 nm is always higher in intensity
than the emission at 613 nm. When water was added to the Eu–DMSO
samples, both the emissions at 617 and 613 nm saw a reduction in intensity,
but the decrease of the peak at 617 nm with water was faster than
that of the 613 nm peak, which might be caused by changes in the Eu3+ environment and symmetry of the complex. Even though the
results of FTIR, NMR, and absorption spectra suggest the interaction
of water with Eu3+, the exact mechanism of faster intensity
decrease at 617 nm is still mysterious. Since the decrease in intensity
at 617 nm is faster than that of 613 nm, the two peaks should have
an equal intensity at a certain concentration of water, named as “turning
point”. It is worthwhile mentioning that this turning point
is different for the samples of different concentrations, as shown
in Table 1 and Figure 7 (left). For the
0.02 M sample, the turning point is at 1.0%, while for the 0.5 M sample,
the turning point is at 13%. This means the interaction of water with
Eu3+ in Eu–DMSO is related to the Eu3+ concentration, which affects the sensitivity for water detection.

The change in the intensities of the 613 and 617 nm
peaks with
water content can be used for water detection. A linear plot of I613/I617 with respect
to water content is shown in Figure 7 (right). The results demonstrate that the linearity
is related to the Eu3+ concentrations and that the 0.2
M Eu–DMSO sample has the strongest luminescence and highest
slope.

As labeled in Figure 1 (right), the two sharp peaks at 592 and 615 nm are
ascribed to the
magnetic dipole (5D0 → 7F1) and electric dipole (5D0 → 7F2) transitions, respectively. As the symmetry
ratio (5D0 → 7F2/5D0 → 7F1) can
provide information about the quality structure of the material,33−36,39 the intensity ratio of 5D0 → 7F2 to 5D0 → 7F1 might be sensitive to
water too. However, the ratios of 5D0 → 7F2 (613 and 617 nm) to 5D0 → 7F1 (592 nm) transitions are not
really sensitive to water, as shown in Figure S5.

On the contrary, the 5D0–7F0 emission is very sensitive to water concentrations,
as seen in Figure S6, even though it is
a forbidden transition by both EDT and MDT mechanisms. As pointed
out earlier, in many phosphors, the emissions of 5D0–7F0 are due to the presence
of oxygen in the crystals, which lowers the site symmetry of Eu3+ ions. Accordingly, the presence of oxygen in DMSO is one
likely reason for observing the 5D0–7F0 emissions. The sensitivity of the 5D0–7F0 emissions to water
further indicates that the 5D0–7F0 transition is involved with the disturbance of external
ions.

To further explore other parameters for water probing,
we investigated
the changes of the intensity ratios of 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, 5D0 → 7F4 to 5D0 → 7F0 with
water (Figures S7, S8, S9, and S10, respectively).
Interestingly, all of the ratios of 5D0 → 7F2(A1)/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F2(E)/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F3/5D0 → 7F0, and 5D0 → 7F4/5D0 → 7F0 are sensitive to water
in certain manners. Among these ratios, the 5D0 → 7F4/5D0 → 7F0 transition is the most sensitive, while the 5D0 → 7F2(A1)/5D0 → 7F0 transition
is the least sensitive. These observations indicate that the intensity
ratios of 5D0 → 7F2(E)/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F3/5D0 → 7F0, and 5D0 → 7F4/5D0 → 7F0 can also be used for water detections, as illustrated
in Figure 8. These
findings also suggest that the changes of the intensity ratios are
not merely due to the concentration changes but as a result of the
intrinsic interactions of water with the Eu3+ ions; however,
the details of the interaction mechanisms are still unknown. For each
ratio, the 0.2 M Eu–DMSO sample has the best sensitivity, demonstrating
that 0.2 M Eu3+ is the optimized concentration for water
detection as well as the luminescence intensity.

for water detection.

Detection of Water in Ethanol
Real-time monitoring
of water content in ethanol is of utmost importance for alcoholic
beverage, fuel, and solvent industries.13 Ethanol is considered as an alternative to fossil fuels such as
gasoline and diesel and has gained immense interest owing to the limited
amount of available fossil fuels, the ever-increasing petroleum cost,
and pollution concerns. While producing ethanol from grains, water
is removed by distillation, and only ethanol with a purity of approximately
93% or higher is suitable to be used as a biofuel. Consequently, a
cost-effective, in situ, reliable, and real-time analysis method to
determine the water contained in ethanol is essential for its usage
as a fuel.45,46

The hypersensitivity of
water to the Eu–DMSO sample and increase in I613/I617 in the presence of
water motivated us to explore its feasibility as the ratiometric fluorescent
probe for the detection of water content in ethanol. For this purpose,
we prepared a Eu–DMSO–ethanol probe by adding 500 μL
of anhydrous ethanol to 2 mL of the Eu–DMSO sample. This probe
was then employed to detect water in ethanol by monitoring the luminescence
quenching effect of water to the probe. The probe shows immediate
response toward water, demonstrating its ability to detect the amount
of water in ethanol in real time.

As can be seen in Figure 9 (left), after adding
water to the probe, the PL intensity
at 613 and 617 nm decreased notably. On the other hand, with the addition
of the same amounts of ethanol, both intensities decreased to a substantially
lesser extent (Figure 9 (right)). For the purpose of comparison, we plotted I613/I617 of the Eu–DMSO–ethanol
probe as a function of water/ethanol concentration in ethanol. As
can be seen in Figure 10 (left), the I613/I617 ratio almost remained constant after diluting the probe
with ethanol. Conversely, after adding DI water, I613/I617 was found to increase,
indicating that our sample can be used as a ratiometric water detection
probe. Furthermore, I613/I617 is plotted as a function of water content in ethanol
to obtain a calibration curve. The linear fitting (Figure 10 (right)) shows that the sample
diluted with DI water is linear with R2 = 0.9969 (RI = 0.289PV + 0.8345, where RI and PV stand for I613/I617 and volume fraction of water in
ethanol, respectively) in a wide concentration range (0–24.24%).
These results suggest that our sample is suitable for in situ and
rapid detection of water in ethanol from a small to high amount of
water based on the ratiometric luminescence determination method.

probe to various water or ethanol content in ethanol. Right: Calibration
plot for determining the linear relationship between I613/I617 and water content

Detection of Water in Gasoline
To further extend the
possibility of the as-prepared Eu–DMSO sample, we attempted
to detect water content in gasoline using the same ratiometric fluorescence
measurement method, based on the ratio of the PL intensities of two
wavelengths (613 and 617 nm) of the same sample. To achieve this goal,
a Eu–DMSO–gasoline probe was prepared by mixing 500
μL of gasoline and 2 mL of Eu–DMSO. The Eu–DMSO–gasoline
probe was then diluted with various amounts of water or gasoline.
Finally, I613/I617 was plotted as a function of water concentrations in gasoline to
quantify the amount of water in gasoline.

As can be seen in Figure 11 (left), after
adding water to the probe, the PL intensities at 613 and 617 nm were
found to decrease significantly compared to the gasoline-added sample
(Figure 11 (right)). Figure 12 (left) was plotted
for the purpose of a comparison between the dilution effect of water
and gasoline to the probe. The result demonstrates that I613/I617 almost remained constant
after diluting the probe with gasoline. In contrast, I613/I617 was found to increase
with the addition of DI water, corroborating our hypothesis that the
sample could be used to detect water in gasoline. The linear fitting
(Figure 12 (right))
displays that the sample diluted with DI water is linear with R2 = 0.9969 (RI =
0.334PV + 0.8448, where RI and PV stand for I613/I617 and volume
fraction of water in gasoline, respectively) in a wide concentration
range (0–32.43%), indicating that the sample is suitable to
detect water in gasoline from a small amount to a high amount.

probe before and after diluting with different concentrations of water

Determination of Detection Limits
The detection limit
(DL) was calculated based on the equation: DL = 3σ/s, where σ is the standard deviation of the y-intercept and s is the slope of the calibration
curve.47 The detection limits of water
in DMSO, ethanol, and gasoline were found to be 0.17, 0.63, and 1.36%
(v/v), respectively. Although it might not be fully justified to compare
our results with the previously published results due to some differences
in the calculation and experimental methods, a comparison of detection
of water in DMSO and ethanol using the Eu–DMSO probe with some
of the previously reported probes is presented in Table 2. As can be seen in Table 2, the detection limit
of the Eu–DMSO probe is comparable to most of the probes for
detecting water in ethanol and DMSO. Considering the facile synthesis
method, good detection limit, wider detection range, and large Stokes
shift, we anticipate that the Eu–DMSO sample could be one of
the deserving candidates for further investigation in the study of
the detection of water in various organic solvents.

Conclusions
We demonstrated, for
the first time, a multiparameter method for
trace water detection using the robust and water-sensitive luminescence
of Eu3+ in DMSO. This one probe with several output parameters
can be constructed with the ratio of the two 5D0 → 7F2 emissions at 613 and 617 nm along
with the intensity ratios of 5D0 → 7F1/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F2/5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F3/5D0 → 7F0, and 5D0 → 7F4/5D0 → 7F0. This multiparameter
method provides reliable yet accurate detection as four parameters
can be used for water detection based on a single agent. The concentration
at 0.2 M has the best sensitivity and linearity for each parameter,
demonstrating that 0.2 M is the optimized concentration for water
detection. Furthermore, to extend its practical applications, water
detections in ethanol and gasoline have been carried out, and the
results demonstrate that I613/I617 increased linearly over a wide range of
water content, signifying it as a promising method for water detection
in ethanol and gasoline. Our future work will focus on a better understanding
of the luminescence quenching mechanism of the sample and the attempt
to extend our knowledge to detect water in other organic solvents.
Overall, considering its straightforward synthesis method, large Stokes
shift, and sensitivity over a wide concentration range, this ratiometric
fluorescent probe could provide a new accessible tool for the quantitative
determination of water content in organic solvents and be a deserving
candidate for further study.

Experimental Section
Materials
Europium
nitrate pentahydrate (Eu(NO3)3·5H2O, 99.9%) and DMSO were received
from Sigma-Aldrich. Anhydrous ethanol was purchased from Decon Labs,
Inc. Gasoline was obtained from a local gas station. All of the chemicals
were used without purification.

Synthesis of Eu–DMSO
Compound
The Eu–DMSO
sample was synthesized following a previously reported method.19 Typically, 2.14 g of Eu(NO3)3·5H2O and 25 mL of DMSO were mixed in a 125
mL three-neck round-bottom flask. The reaction mixture was then heated
at 150 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen environment with vigorous
magnetic stirring. Finally, the solution was cooled to room temperature
naturally under a nitrogen environment.

Investigation of Effects
of Eu3+ Concentration on
Luminescence
To investigate the luminescence quenching effect
of the as-prepared Eu–DMSO sample in the presence of water,
the sample was diluted with desired amounts of DI water. The emission
spectra (excitation wavelength = 394 nm) of all of the samples were
recorded on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer at room temperature.
To serve as a control, the sample (Eu–DMSO) was diluted with
equal amounts of DMSO.

FTIR, UV–Vis Absorption, and NMR Spectra
FTIR
spectra were obtained using a Bruker Alpha-P FT-IR Spectrometer using
attenuated total reflectance on a diamond sample plate. 1H NMR spectroscopic data were recorded on a 500 MHz JEOL spectrometer
and referenced to the internal solvent signal (7.26 ppm in CDCl3).

13C NMR spectroscopic data were recorded
on a 125 MHz JEOL spectrometer and referenced to the internal solvent
signal (central peak 77.00 ppm in CDCl3). The UV–vis
absorption spectra of the Eu–DMSO sample after adding DMSO
or DI water were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV–vis spectrophotometer.

Detection of Water in Ethanol and Gasoline
To detect
the water impurity in ethanol, the Eu–DMSO–ethanol probe
was prepared by mixing 500 μL of anhydrous ethanol and 2 mL
of the Eu–DMSO sample. After measuring its PL intensity, the
probe was diluted with various amounts of DI water to investigate
its luminescence quenching effect. For the purpose of comparison,
the probe was diluted with an equal volume of ethanol instead of DI
water. Similarly, to detect water in gasoline, the Eu–DMSO–gasoline
probe was prepared by adding 500 μL of gasoline to 2 mL of the
Eu–DMSO sample and all other experimental conditions were the
same except gasoline was used instead of ethanol. Finally, a calibration
curve of I613/I617 was established as a function of water/ethanol or water/gasoline
content to quantify water contents. All measurements were carried
out right after adding DI water, ethanol, or gasoline in the respective
probes, suggesting its very fast response rate and capability for
real-time monitoring of trace water in organic solvents.
