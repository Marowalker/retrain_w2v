Simple
and selective zero- and second-order derivative circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopic methods have been designed for the assay
of captopril in commercially available dosage forms. A normal CD spectroscopic
scan (zero order) exhibits a negative band at 208 nm (method A) in
distilled water. The calibration curve shows a linear response over
the concentration range of 10–80 μg mL–1. The second-order derivative (D2) CD spectrum shows one positive
band at 208 nm (method B) and one negative band at 225 nm (method
C). Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range
of 10–70 μg mL–1 for both the methods
(B and C). The detection limits were found to be 1.26, 1.48, and 2.38
μg mL–1 for methods A, B, and C, respectively.
The study under stressed acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions showed
the degradation of captopril. The proposed methods were validated
as per ICH guidelines. All the proposed methods were compared with
the reference method to demonstrate its suitability for quality control
of captopril in its dosage forms.

==== Body
Introduction
Captopril
is chemically designated as (2S)-1-(3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl)-l-proline (Figure 1), which contains the carboxyl group with a pK1 of 3.7 and a thiol group with a pK2 of 9.8. It is the first angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
belonging to the sulfhydryl group. It is helpful in reducing the peripheral
resistance and maintaining the normal blood pressure.1−3 Furthermore, it is prescribed for the treatment of congestive heart
failure, angina, Raynaud’s phenomenon, rheumatoid arthritis,
and safeguards the kidney function in diabetic nephropathy.4,5 Captopril also found to be effective in the treatment of cancer
as it restrains tumour angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial cell
matrix metalloproteinases and endothelial cell migration.6 Therapeutic effect of captopril may overturn
to toxicity if taken in high doses.5 Because
of its widespread consumption, it is mandatory to keep an eye toward
the efficacy of drug, and hence quantitative analysis needs to be
performed in order to control the quality of active pharmaceutical
ingredients in pharmaceutical formulations.7 In view of quality assurance of pharmaceuticals, a variety of analytical
techniques has been utilized to determine the active pharmaceutical
ingredients and their degradation products and impurities in commercial
dosage forms and bulk drugs.8−10

Figure 1 Chemical structure of captopril.

The United States of Pharmacopoeia11 and British Pharmacopoeia12 proposed
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantitative determination
of captopril. Literature survey showed that quantitative analysis
of captopril in pharmaceutical formulations and biological samples
has been done using different analytical techniques including thin-layer
chromatography,13 HPLC,14−19 gas chromatography,20 NMR,21 spectrophotometry,22−26 spectrofluorimetry,27,28 FT-Raman,29 capillary electrophoresis,16,30 and electroanalytical methods.31−34

Circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy has not been explored much
in the field of quality assurance of drugs, although this analytical
technique holds high selectivity toward direct quantitative determination
of optically active drug and quiet sensitive to absolute configurations
and conformational features.35 In recent
years, CD has been employed for enantiopurity determination.36 The use of CD is not found in Chinese Pharmacopoeia
and International Pharmacopoeia.37 However,
CD has the ability to discriminate enantiomers and diastereomers on
the basis of their CD spectra.38 CD spectroscopy
is advantageous in determining enantiomers because rigorous pretreatment
of the sample is not needed. Moreover, another advantage associated
with CD is that the identification and determination can be performed
in aqueous solutions. The CD spectroscopic method has been used in
the determination of ampicillin and cloxacillin.39

In this study, CD spectra of aqueous solution of
captopril were
recorded in the wavelength range of 200–300 nm. The CD spectra
exhibited a negative band peaking at 208 nm which forms the basis
for quantitative determination of captopril. Moreover, second-order
derivative CD spectra showed a positive band centered at 208 nm and
a negative band with maximum at 225 nm. The quantitative analysis
was performed by measuring ellipticity at 208 nm (negative band) and
second-order derivative of ellipticity at 208 nm (positive band) and
225 nm (negative band). The stability of captopril was also assessed
under different stressed conditions.

Results and Discussion
Spectral
Studies
The CD spectrum (zero order) of captopril
dissolved in distilled water showed one negative band centered at
208 nm (Figure S1). The CD spectrum is
considered to be the sum of the chirality of its individual components,
(S)-proline and (2S)-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionic
acid.40 The negative peak in the CD spectrum
at 208 nm may be due to n → π* transition of the carboxylate
group mixed with the n → σ* transition of the amino group
of proline moiety.41 The quantitative determination
of captopril was performed by measuring the ellipticity, θ,
of the sample at 208 nm.

CD is the difference in absorption
of left-handed polarized light versus right-handed polarized light,
which can be expressed as 1  

The ΔA can be related to ellipticity as 2  

Equation 2 suggested
that the measured ellipticity should obey Beer–Lambert’s
law. The molar ellipticity [θ] was calculated using the equation 3  where MW is the molecular weight of captopril
and d and c represent the path length
(cm) and concentration (mg mL–1). The molar ellipticity
at 208 nm was found to be −39383.81° cm2 dmol–1.

The method of derivative spectroscopy offers
alternative approaches
to enhance the sensitivity and specificity in analysis. In this study,
validation of three methods (A, B, and C) is considered for determination
of captopril in pharmaceutical preparations. The shape of the derivative
curve is highly dependent upon the smoothing factor (n). Therefore, different values of n in the range
1–5 were considered in recording the D2 spectra
of the drug. The best results were obtained with n = 4, scan rate = 50 nm/min, and band width = 2 nm.

Effect of pH
The CD spectra of captopril were recorded
in acetate buffer of varying pH values (1–5) and water in order
to obtain the best response (Figure 2). It was found that the maximum ellipticity was obtained
in water as the solvent. In acetate buffer solutions, the ellipticity
was decreased which may be because of degradation of captopril. Therefore,
all further studies were performed by dissolving captopril in distilled
water.

acetate buffer of varying pH.

Calibration Curve
Zero-Order Method
Under the optimized
experimental
conditions, zero-order CD spectra of varying concentrations of captopril
(10–80 μg mL–1) were recorded (Figure 3a). The calibration
curve (Figure 3b) was
constructed by plotting ellipticity (at 208 nm) against the concentration
of the drug. The linearity of the curve was obtained in the concentration
range of 10–80 μg mL–1. The high value
of correlation coefficient (R2), that
is, 0.9996 validates the linearity of regression line. The regression
parameters are shown in Table 1. The limits of detection and quantitation were evaluated
as per International Conference of Harmonization guidelines (ICH)42 using the following expression 4   5  where
SD and b are the standard
deviation of intercept and the slope of regression line, respectively.
The limit of detection equivalent to 1.26 μg mL–1 signifies good sensitivity of the proposed method.

Second-Order Derivative Method
Calibration curves were
prepared for the determination of captopril using the CD spectroscopic
method operated under the D2 mode in the wavelength range
200–300 nm. The D2 spectrum shows one positive band
with maximum at 208 nm and one negative band peaking at 225 nm (Figure 4). Calibration plots
(Figure 5) were obtained
at 208 nm (method B) and 225 nm (method C) separately by plotting
second-order derivative ellipticity against the concentration in the
range of 10–70 μg mL–1. Statistical data were evaluated for both the calibration curves
by using least squares method and are reported in Table 1. In methods B and C, the calibration
curves were obtained by plotting the second-order derivative of ellipticity
versus concentration at 208 and 225 nm, respectively, and found to
be linear in the concentration range of 10–70 μg mL–1 for both the methods. In method A, the linearity
of the calibration curve was 10–80 μg mL–1. This difference in the linear range may be due to the derivatization
of ellipticity. The differences in detection limits for methods A,
B, and C were due to the different standard deviation of intercepts
and slopes of regression lines.

Method Validation
Accuracy and Precision
The accuracy
(% relative error)
and precision (% RSD) of the proposed methods under optimum experimental
conditions were evaluated by performing analysis of captopril at three
concentration levels (10, 40, and 60 μg mL–1) in the same day (intraday) at different time intervals and in six
different days (interday). Five replicate analyses were performed
and the results are reported in Table 2. The percent relative error varies from −0.27
to 0.14%, 0.11 to 0.28%, and −0.20 to 0.03% for methods A,
B, and C, respectively. The intraday precision was found to vary from
0.11 to 1.13%, 0.11 to 0.28%, and 0.10 to 1.20%, for methods A, B,
and C, respectively. The interday precision varies from 0.15 to 0.51%,
0.10 to 0.50%, and 0.16 to 0.94%, for methods A, B, and C, respectively.
The results demonstrated the good repeatability and reproducibility
of the proposed methods.

Selectivity
Glucose, fructose, lactose, starch, and
magnesium stearate, the commonly occurring excipients in the commercial
dosages were examined in order to verify its interference. Monosaccharides
and polysaccharides which are optically active did not interfere with
the CD signal as they do not absorb in the UV region. The methods
showed no interference from excipients.

Effect of Forced Degradation
To study the stability
of drug under stress conditions,43,44 captopril
was induced to oxidation, sunlight, alkaline, and acidic hydrolysis,
leading to appreciable changes. Summary of results of stress degradation
studies of captopril is reported in Table 3. Captopril disulphide is the main degradation
product of captopril under all stressed conditions.45−47Figure 6 shows the degradation pathway
of captopril under different stress conditions.

Application
Captopril in two different pharmaceutical
dosage forms was determined by the proposed methods and the reference
method.48 The results of the proposed method
were compared with those of the reference method using point and interval
hypothesis tests49 (Table 4). As the calculated t-(paired)
and F-values at the 95% confidence level were less
than the tabulated ones, it was concluded that no significant difference
among the two methods was observed. In the interval hypothesis test,
the true bias based on recovery experiments was evaluated from the
following equation49,50 6  where X̅1 and X̅2 are mean values determined
by the proposed and reference methods, respectively. Sp and t are the pooled standard deviation and one-sided t-value at the 95% confidence level, respectively. n1 and n2 are the
number of measurements of the proposed and reference methods, respectively.
The values of lower limit (θL) and upper limit (θU) are reported in Table 4. The true bias of all the dosages of captopril was
found to be less than ±2%, thereby indicating the compliance
of the regulatory authorities.51

Conclusions
Simple and selective CD spectroscopic methods
were first designed
for analysis of captopril in commercial dosages. This methodology
is based on the measurement of ellipticity against captopril concentration.
The adequate sensitivity (LOD = 1.26, 2.38, and 1.48 μg mL–1 for the respective methods) and high precision (RSD
≤ 1.5%) over the calibration range made the proposed methods
favorable over the existing methods for the quantification of captopril.
In addition, the results obtained in the analysis of captopril in
commercial dosages demonstrated its successful applicability in the
quality assurance of an active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
Captopril was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric
acid were obtained from Qualigens Fine chemicals Ltd., India. Hydrogen
peroxide (30%) was purchased from Avantor Performance Materials India
Ltd. (Thane, India). The commercial dosages of captopril, such as
Acetin (Wockhardt Ltd., India) and Capotril (Lupin Laboratories Ltd.,
India), were purchased from local pharmacy. Each tablet was labeled
to contain 25 mg captopril.

Equipment
A JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer
(Jasco Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan) was used for recording CD spectra at ambient temperatures.
This instrument is equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp, 2.0 mm quartz
cuvette, and temperature control unit. The following parameters were
used for recording the spectra.i Bandwidth = 2 nm

ii Response time = 15 s

iii Standard sensitivity

iv Wavelength range = 200–300 nm

v Scanning rate = 50 nm/min

vi Scan accumulations = 04
(averaged at
the end)



The pH measurements were carried
out using an Eutech
digital pH meter (model: Cyberscan pH 2100).

Preparation of Stock Solutions
i Captopril (0.1 mg mL–1) standard solution was prepared
by dissolving 10 mg of the pure
drug in 100 mL distilled water.

ii 0.1 and 0.2 mol L–1 sodium hydroxide solutions
were prepared in distilled water.

iii 0.1 and 0.2 mol L–1 hydrochloric
acid solutions were also prepared in distilled water.



Analytical Procedures
Method A (Zero Order)
Varying volumes
of the stock
solution of captopril (0.1 mg mL–1) equivalent to
10–80 μg mL–1 were pipette into a 10
mL volumetric flask and diluted to volume with distilled water. The
zero-order spectra of all the solutions were recorded against distilled
water as blank. The ellipticity (θ) at 208 nm was plotted against
the concentration of pure drug. Also, the regression equation was
developed to determine the concentration of captopril in the samples.

Methods B and C (Second-Order Derivative)
Zero-order
spectra were derivatized in the wavelength range of 200–300
nm and the second-order derivative spectrum exhibited a positive band
peaking at 208 nm and a negative band centered at 225 nm. The ellipticities
were measured at 208 and 225 nm for a series of solutions (10–70
μg mL–1). Calibration graphs were ascertained
by plotting second-order derivative ellipticity against concentrations
of captopril. Alternatively, regression equations were also obtained.

Degradation Studies
i Alkaline- and acidic-forced degradation:
10 mg of captopril in 100 mL of 0.1 mol L–1 sodium
hydroxide or hydrochloric acid was refluxed separately at 60 °C
for 48 h. After cooling the solutions to room temperature, the individual
samples were neutralized with 0.2 mol L–1 sodium
hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to avoid further decomposition. This
forced degradation in alkaline and acidic media was performed in dark
so as to prevent possible photodegradation. Suitable aliquots were
taken from the stock-degraded samples for assay under the aforementioned
conditions.

ii Oxidative-forced
degradation: The stock
solution of captopril was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of a pure drug
in 10 mL of distilled water. To this solution, 1 mL of 30% hydrogen
peroxide was added and the volume was completed to 100 mL with distilled
water. The solution was kept for 7 days at room temperature. Suitable
aliquots were taken for analysis.

iii Effect of sunlight: Captopril solution
(100 μg mL–1; 100 mL) was exposed to sunlight
for 7 days and analysed using the proposed procedures.



Procedure for the Assay of Captopril in Pharmaceutical Formulations
A single tablet containing 25 mg captopril from each brand, namely
acetin and capotril, was weighed and crushed to fine powder. A portion
of the fine powder corresponding to 10 mg of the captopril was weighed
accurately and swirled in distilled water for some time in order to
achieve complete dissolution of the active drug. The residue was then
filtered on a Whatman no. 1 filter paper and the filtrate was transferred
into a 100 mL volumetric flask and completed to volume with distilled
water. Suitable aliquot was taken to perform quantitative analysis
following the methods A, B, and C.
