Tetramethyldisiloxa[3]metallocenophanes
of the heavy group 14 elements
germanium, 2a, tin, 2b, and lead, 2c, (tetrelocenophanes) have been synthesized by the reaction
of dilithiated ligand, 1, with the corresponding element(II)
chloride. The plumbocenophane, 2c, forms one-dimensional
coordination polymers in the solid state, while the germanocenophane, 2a, and the stannocenophane, 2b, are monomeric.
Furthermore, the reactivity of the stannocenophane, 2b, and the plumbocenophane, 2c, toward N-heterocyclic
carbenes was explored. Although the coordination of carbene is reversible
in solution at room temperature, the corresponding carbene complexes, 3a,b, could be structurally characterized, illustrating
the Lewis acidity of the central atom in these metallocenophanes.

==== Body
Introduction
Metallocenes with interlinked
cyclopentadienyl moieties, so called ansa-metallocenes
or metallocenophanes, have been known
for over half a century, with examples for various transition metals.1 They have attracted wide attention for their
applications as catalysts in homogeneous catalysis or as monomers
in ring-opening polymerization reactions.2,3 In
contrast, metallocenophanes of p-block elements are much less common,
with only a handful of structurally characterized examples, mostly
of group 14 elements (tetrelocenophanes).4−10 This is particularly surprising, as the unbridged parent compounds
have been known for a long time,11−13 with stannocene and
plumbocene being the first diorganotetrylene type compounds described
in the literature.14,15 Furthermore, these species could
be of potential interest as precursors in the preparation of p-block
metal-containing oligomers and polymers. With the great progress in
low-valent group 14 chemistry in recent years,16−19 and our group’s interest
in the main group element-based metallocenophanes, our aim was to
investigate the influence of different bridging motifs on the molecular
geometry and reactivity of tetrelocenophanes. Whereas previous studies
focused on disila[2]metallocenophanes,9,10,20 we now report the first synthesis and structural
characterization of three-atomic bridged metallocenophanes of p-block
elements, in the form of disiloxa[3]tetrelocenophanes of group 14
elements germanium, tin, and lead, 2a–c. Although
the tetramethyldisiloxa[3] bridging motif has been employed in transition
metal-based metallocenophanes in the past,21−26 no p-block metallocenophanes with three-atomic bridging motifs have
been reported, so far.

Results and Discussion
The reaction
of dilithiated ligand 1 with the corresponding
element(II) chloride proceeds smoothly at 173 K to give the corresponding
[3]tetrelocenophanes, 2a–c, in good yields (Scheme 1). Stannocenophane, 2b, and plumbocenophane, 2c, exhibit very upfield-shifted
NMR resonances in the 119Sn and 207Pb NMR spectra,
respectively, (δ119Sn(2b) = −2124;
δ207Pb(2c) = −4795), as is typical
for tin(II)- and lead(II)-based metallocenes.9,10

thf]
Crystals suitable for single
crystal X-ray diffraction analysis
were obtained from hexane solutions at 248 K, allowing for a structural
characterization of tetrelocenophanes 2a–c (Figure 1).

of (a) 2a, (b) 2b, and (c) 2c in the crystal (thermal ellipsoids at 50%
probability level, except for the ansa-bridge of 2c in (c); H atoms omitted for clarity).

While germanocenophane, 2a, and stannocenophane, 2b, are monomeric in the solid state, plumbocenophane, 2c, exhibits a one dimensional polymeric structure in the
crystal in which each lead atom is coordinated by three cyclopentadienyl
ligands, similar to what is found for plumbocene (Cp2Pb)
in the solid state,27−29 and unlike what was reported earlier for a permethylated
Si[2]plumbocenophane.9 The intermolecular
Pb–CCp distances are longer (337.9–395.1
pm) than the intramolecular ones (243.0–256.0 pm), suggesting
rather weak intermolecular interactions, which is in line with the
assumption that plumbocenophane, 2c, is monomeric in
solution. The metal–Cp bonds in 2a–c are
within normal ranges for group 14 metallocenes.10 When comparing the dihedral angles of the Cp planes, α,
in [3]tetrelocenophanes 2a–c to the angles α
found in the previously reported permethylated [2]tetrelocenophanes,9 one conspicuous difference is that [3]tetrelocenophanes 2a–c exhibit a more bent geometry, much like the unbridged
parent compounds germanocene (Cp2Ge),30 stannocene (Cp2Sn),31 and plumbocene (Cp2Pb).27−29 This is because of the
stereochemically active lone pair at the central atom. The influence
of the Si–O–Si ansa-bridge in tetrelocenophanes 2a–c on the dihedral angle of the Cp-planes, α,
is comparably small (Table 1). This is because of the fact that the Si–O–Si
moiety is very flexible and that the ansa-bridge
is not bound to be positioned on the far side relative to the lone
pair of the central atom (Chart 1, 2-I), but can be located laterally (Chart 1, 2-II). This is more pronounced in germanocenophane, 2a,
with shorter Ge–Cp bonds and a larger dihedral angle α
between the Cp planes, and less pronounced in stannocenophane, 2b (2a: ϕ32 =
56.1°; 2b: ϕ32 =
51.1°), and indicates that the lone pair has a stronger effect
on the dihedral angle α than the ansa-bridge
in tetrelocenophanes 2a–c. In all cases, however,
packing effects in the crystal have to be taken into consideration
as well.

As tetrelocenophanes 2a–c could be of interest
as monomers in the preparation of the corresponding polymetallocenylsiloxanes,
we explored the possibility to prepare an analogous disiloxanyl-bridged
distannocene, which would be a two-repeat-unit model compound of such
a polymer. This is in analogy to a report of Zuckerman and co-workers
on the synthesis of a xylyl-bridged distannocene.6 However, when dilithiated ligand, 1, was reacted
with two equivalents of cyclopentadienyltin(II) chloride, the 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR spectra showed
exclusive formation of stannocenophane, 2b, and stannocene, 4 [δ119Sn = −2124 (2b), −2199 (4)] (Scheme 2). It remains unclear, whether a bridged
distannocene is initially formed and undergoes a subsequent redistribution
reaction to give 2b and 4, or if cyclopentadienyllithium
is eliminated from a monosubstituted intermediate, giving 2b and reacting with cyclopentadienyltin(II) chloride to give 4. In either case, entropic effect might be the driving force
for the formation of 2b and 4 as the sole
products of the reaction.

Scheme 2 Reaction of Dilithiated Ligand, 1, with Cyclopentadienyltin(II)
Chloride, To Give Stannocenophane, 2b, and Stannocene, 4
In light of these results,
it remains unclear if Zuckerman and
co-workers had actually obtained a xylyl-bridged distannocene, as
no 119Sn NMR chemical shifts or structural characterization
were reported.6

Polymetallocenes
are most commonly prepared by ring-opening polymerizations
starting from the corresponding metallocenophanes, by cleavage of
either the metal–Cp bond or the ansa-bridge-Cp
bond.2 Because previous studies of stannocene
carbene complexes revealed that the coordination of a strong σ
donor can weaken the metal–Cp bond,33 this was further explored as a potential mechanism for metal-Cp
bond activation in tetrelocenophanes, by reacting stannocenophane, 2b, with 1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene. Upon mixing
stannocenophane 2b and NHC in benzene at room temperature
and examining the mixture by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, a downfield
shift of the 119Sn resonance was observed (δ119Sn = −1761; Δδ119Sn = 363
vs 2b), along with a resonance of δ13C = 200.3 for the carbene carbon atom. These findings clearly indicate
a coordination of NHC to the tin atom in stannocenophane 2b. Likewise, when plumbocenophane 2c was reacted with
1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene in toluene at room temperature,
a similar coordination was observed (Scheme 3).34

Scheme 3 Reaction
of Disiloxa[3]tetrelocenophanes, 2b,c, with
NHC To Give NHC Complexes 3a,b (2b/3a: E = Sn; 2c/3b: E = Pb;
NHC = 1,3,4,5-Tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene)
Crystals of complexes 3a,b suitable
for
single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, could be obtained from
thf (3a) and toluene (3b) solutions at 248
K, allowing for structural characterization (Figure 2). Noteworthy, plumbocenophane NHC complex 3b represents the first example of a carbene adduct of a bis(cyclopentadienyl)lead
compound. The Sn–CNHC bond in complex 3a is 245.7 pm, the Pb–CNHC bond in complex 3b is 258.2 pm. This is comparably long (e.g.,: {(Me3Si)3Si}2Sn–NHC: 228.7 pm;35 {(Me2Si)2((Me3Si)2Si)2}Sn–NHC: 229.5 pm;35 Ter(H)Pb–NHC: 233.2 pm36), but similar to what has been observed previously for
stannocene carbene complexes.33 The E–Cp
bonds in complexes 3a,b are significantly
elongated compared to stannocenophane 2b and plumbocenophane 2c, respectively (Table 1), which indicates a weakening of the metal Cp bonds
upon coordination of NHC. This is in line with the previous observations
in stannocene carbene complexes33 and can
be rationalized by the donation of the carbene into the antibonding
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the metallocene (Figure 3).

(a) stannocenophane NHC complex 3a and (b) plumbocenophane
NHC complex 3b in the crystal
(thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability level, H atoms omitted for
clarity).

Figure 3 Isosurface plot of the LUMO (Kohn–Sham
orbital) of stannocenophane 2b (B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP, isovalue
= 0.035).

The LUMO of stannocenophane 2b and plumbocenophane 2c, as is typical for
tetrelocenes in general, corresponds
to an antibonding interaction of a p-orbital at the central atom with
the cyclopentadienyl ligand orbitals.12,13,33 Therefore, the NHC coordinates to the metal atom
in 3a,b. In a “side-on” fashion
and donation of electron density into the LUMO weakens the E–Cp
bond. This is further illustrated by the fact that complex 3a is extremely reactive and decomposes in solution at room temperature
within hours. The fact that only a weakening and no cleavage of the
E–Cp bonds is observed, might be due to the fact that the carbene
coordination is relatively weak. This is in line with calculated complexation
energies of ΔE = −65.9 kJ mol–1 (ΔG298 = −5.3 kJ mol–1) for 3a and ΔE = −72.2 kJ mol–1 (ΔG298 = −17.9 kJ mol–1) for 3b (complexation energies refer to the reactions 3a,b → 2b,c + NHC and
are calculated at B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP37).
Therefore, 3a,b might exist in a dissociative
equilibrium in solution and an averaged set of signals is observed
in the NMR spectra at room temperature.

To probe this further,
solid state 13C and 119Sn CP/MAS NMR measurements
of complex 3a were conducted
(Figure 4). Stannocenophane
NHC complex 3a exhibits a 119Sn NMR chemical
shift in the solid state of δ119Sn = −1360,
which is downfield shifted by Δδ119Sn = 401
compared to what is observed in solution at room temperature. The
carbene-carbon atom exhibits a 13C NMR chemical shift of
δ13C = 196.5 in the solid state, with a C–Sn
coupling constant of 1JCSn =
587 Hz. This clearly indicates that an averaged set of signals is
observed in solution at room temperature and that stannocenophane
NHC complex 3a in fact exists in a dissociative equilibrium
with stannocenophane 2b + NHC.

Figure 4 119Sn{1H} CP/MAS NMR spectra of stannocenophane
NHC complex 3a. Upper trace: 13 kHz MAS, lower trace:
10 kHz MAS [δiso = −1360; δ11 = −907(±7); δ22 = −1210(±6);
δ33 = −1962(±1); Ω(δ11–δ33) = 1055].

To further verify this, the stoichiometry of the reaction was varied.
When two equivalents of stannocenophane, 2b, are mixed
with one equivalent of NHC, only one set of signals is observed in
the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, along with one signal
in the 119Sn NMR spectra at δ119Sn = −1976.
This is upfield shifted by Δδ119Sn = 215, compared
to what was observed for solutions derived from 3a (δ119Sn = −1761), indicating a fast equilibrium between
carbene complex, 3a, and uncoordinated 2b + NHC.38 In addition, when a solution
of 3a or 3b is treated with aluminum chloride,
almost instantaneous formation of NHC·AlCl3 and metallocenophanes 2b,c is observed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy
(Scheme 4).39

Scheme 4 Reaction of NHC Complexes 3a,b with AlCl3 (2b/3a: E = Sn; 2c/3b: E = Pb; NHC = 1,3,4,5-Tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene)
This further supports the assumption that the
NHC coordination
is reversible and that 3a,b exist in a dissociative
equilibrium with 2b,c + NHC.

Conclusions
In summary, the synthesis and structural characterization of tetramethyldisiloxa[3]germanocenophane, 2a, tetramethyl-disiloxa[3]stannocenophane, 2b, and tetramethyldisiloxa[3]plumbocenophane, 2c is reported.
In case of stannocenophane, 2b, it was shown that it
can also be obtained by treatment of dilithiated ligand 1, with two equivalents of cyclopentadienyltin(II) chloride, which
might reveal Zuckerman’s report of a distannocene in a different
light. Furthermore, stannocenophane 2b, and plumbocenophane 2c react with 1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene (NHC)
to give the corresponding carbene complexes 3a,b. These complexes are believed to exist in a dissociative
equilibrium in solution at room temperature, as indicated by comparison
of solution and solid state CP/MAS 119Sn NMR spectroscopy
in case of 3a, as well as abstraction of NHC by treatment
of 3a,b with aluminum chloride and calculated
complexation energies (ΔE) of just −65.9
kJ mol–1 (3a) and −72.2 kJ mol–1 (3b).

Experimental Section
All manipulations were carried out under an inert gas atmosphere
(argon 5.0), using either Schlenk line techniques of a glovebox. Dilithiated
ligand 1,21−24,26 1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene,40 and cyclopentadienyltin(II) chloride41−43 were synthesized according to literature-known procedures. NMR-spectra
were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III 300 (solution NMR), Bruker AVANCE
III 400 (solution NMR), and Bruker Ascend 400WB (solid state NMR)
spectrometers. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were referenced
using the solvent signals [δ1H (C6HD5) = 7.16; δ13C (C6D6) = 128.06]. 29Si, 119Sn, and 207Pb NMR spectra were referenced using external standards [δ29Si(SiMe4) = 0; δ119Sn(SnMe4) = 0; δ207Pb(PbMe4) = 0]. Elemental
analysis were performed on an Elementar vario MICRO cube (in some
cases low carbon values were repeatedly reproducibly observed, presumably
because of the formation of silicon carbide). Single crystal X-ray
diffraction analysis was carried out at low temperatures on Bruker
AXS X8 Apex CCD and Bruker AXS D8 Venture diffractometers operating
with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation. Structure solution
and refinement were performed using SHELX.44 Crystal structures have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre (CCDC) and are available free of charge from the Cambridge

the solution was stirred at 173 K for 90 min. Subsequently, the mixture
was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional

When germanocenophane 2a was
treated with 1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazole-2-ylidene, a complex mixture
of products was observed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy
at room temperature. Attempts to isolate a complex similar to 3a,b were unsuccessful.

All DFT calculations were performed using
the Gaussian 09 Revision D.01 package of programs. See Supporting Information for further information,
optimized geometries and references.


VT-NMR investigations at low temperatures
did not reveal any signal in the 119Sn NMR spectra, presumably
due to low solubility of 3a and extreme signal broadening.
Signals in the 1H NMR spectra were slightly shifted, but
remained as a single set of signals down to 233 K, indicating a fast
equilibrium with low barriers.


3a,b and AlCl3 were mixed and
dissolved in C6D6 and
the solution was examined by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, revealing
formation of 2b,c along with NHC AlCl3 and [NHC2 AlCl2][AlCl4]
(indicated by signals in the 27Al NMR at δ27Al = 102.9, 104.4, 107.4).
