Donor–acceptor
systems forming exciplexes are versatile
models for the study of magnetic field effects (MFEs) on charge recombination
reactions. The MFEs originate from singlet–triplet interconversion
within transient radical ion pairs (RIPs), which exist in a dynamic
equilibrium with the exciplexes. Here, we describe the synthesis and
MFEs of the chain-linked N,N-dimethylaniline
(DMA)/9-methylanthracene (MAnt) donor–acceptor system MAnt–(CH2)n–O–CH2–CH2–DMA for n =
6, 8, 10, and 16. The MFEs are found to increase with increasing chain
length. Effects as large as 37.5% have been observed for the long-chain
compound with n = 16. The solvent dependence of the
MFEs at magnetic field intensity 75 mT is reported. For the range
of solvent static dielectric constants εs = 6.0–36.0,
the MFEs go through a maximum for intermediate polarities, for which
the direct formation of RIPs prevails and their dissociation and reencounter
are balanced. Field-resolved measurements (MARY spectra) are reported
for solutions in butyronitrile. The MARY spectra reveal that for n = 8, 10, 16, the average exchange interaction is negligible
during the coherent lifetime of the radical pair. However, singlet–triplet
dephasing broadens the lineshape; the shorter the linker, the more
pronounced this effect is. For n = 6, a dip in the
fluorescence intensity reveals a nonzero average exchange coupling
of the order of ±5 mT. We discuss the field-dependence in the
framework of the semiclassical theory taking spin-selective recombination,
singlet–triplet dephasing, and exchange coupling into account.
Singlet recombination rates of the order of 0.1 ns–1 and various degrees of singlet–triplet dephasing govern the
spin dynamics. In addition, because of a small free energy gap between
the exciplex and the locally excited fluorophore quencher pair, a
fully reversible interconversion between the RIP, exciplex, and locally
excited fluorophore is revealed by spectrally resolved MFE measurements
for the long-chain systems (n = 10, 16).

Introduction
Exciplexes are excited-state
charge-transfer complexes that can
be formed in photo-induced electron-transfer (PET) reactions in moderately
polar solutions. Magnetic field effects (MFEs) on the emission of
exciplexes have been extensively studied for many years.1−16 The MFEs result from the magnetic field-dependent intersystem crossing
within the fully charge-separated radical ion pairs (RIPs) in equilibrium
with the exciplexes (see Figure 1). By systematically studying the MFE of the exciplex
emission, details of the dynamics of the spin-correlated RIP can be
revealed indirectly.5,6,9−11 The MFEs are theoretically accounted for in the framework
of the so-called radical pair mechanism.4,12,13,17−20 It relies on the quantum-coherent mixing, by the hyperfine interaction
(HFI) and its interplay with the Zeeman interaction, of the singlet
(S) and three triplet sublevels (T±, T0) describing the spin configurations of the two uncompensated electron
spins on the radical ions (hyperfine mechanism). Specifically, for
high magnetic field intensities, the degree of singlet–triplet
mixing is reduced as the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy of the
triplet and singlet states (see Figure 2a), thereby reducing the number of states accessible
to spin mixing. As a consequence, the singlet–triplet conversion
is impeded and the yield of the charge-recombination products accessible
from the singlet radical pair, such as the exciplex, increases. For
moderate field intensities, the alternative Δg-mechanism is typically irrelevant as the difference in the Larmor
precession frequencies of the two radicals, μBΔgB0/ℏ, is small compared with their inverse
lifetime. Figure 1 depicts
a comprehensive reaction scheme of an intramolecular PET processes
in an exciplex-forming fluorophore-bridge-quencher system with flexible
linker. The ordinate symbolizes free energy and the abscissa corresponds
to a projection of a two-dimensional reaction coordinate, which comprises
the interparticle distance and the solvent polarization in the form
of the Marcus outer-sphere electron–transfer (ET) coordinate.8,9 See refs9,11,21−23 for a discussion of various reaction pathways. These studies mostly
pertain to intermolecular systems. The notable exception is the work
of Zachariasse and co-workers detailing the effect of the bridge on
the free-energy difference of exciplex and ion-pair in a linked anthracene/amine
exciplex system.23 Together, these studies
suggest that the relative importance of the quenching pathways 2A
and 2B in Figure 1 is
expected to vary with chain length and solvent polarity.

Figure 1 Reaction scheme
underlying the MFEs of an intramolecular, exciplex-forming
donor–acceptor systems at weak-to-moderate field intensities.
The pertinent reaction steps are (1) photoexcitation, (2A) direct
RIP formation by distant ET, (2B) exciplex formation, (2C) reversible
inter-conversion of the exciplex to the locally excited fluorophore–quencher
pair, (3) exciplex dissociation into RIP, (4) singlet–triplet
interconversion by the HFI, (5) reformation of the exciplex from the
singlet ion pair, and (6) exciplex emission. The blue and red arrows
refer to the, in part radiative, decay processes of the locally excited
fluorophore and the exciplex, respectively. Spin multiplicities are
indicated by superscripts.

Figure 2 Graphic visualization of the relative energies of the S- and T-states
that govern the ISC efficiency for B0 =
0 (left) and in the presence of an external magnetic field for systems
without [(a) J(r) = 0] and with
sizeable, negative [(b) J(r) <
0] exchange coupling. Assuming that the HFIs are small on the drawn
scale, which is usually the case, efficient intersystem crossing depends
on the approximate degeneracy of the S- and T-states.

The degree and characteristics of the magnetosensitivity
of the
RIP depend on the strength of the exchange interaction of the two
radicals. By energetically splitting singlet from triplet states,
the primary effect of this interaction is to suppress MFEs (see Figure 2b; left scenario).24 As the exchange integral J(r) decreases approximately exponentially with the inter-radical
distance r, J(r) = J0 exp(−ξr), large MFEs are often dependent on the diffusive separation of
the two radicals (followed by their reencounter and recombination
for product formation). Typically, ξ ≈ 0.4 nm–1 while J0 varies from system to system.18 Consequently, for distances of the order of
tens of angstroms the exchange interaction falls off to zero,18 and the degeneracy of the singlet and three
triplet states (in the absence of an external magnetic field) enable
MFEs as described in the previous paragraph. Alternatively, if the
radical pair experiences a nonzero exchange interaction, significant
MFEs can still occur if the external magnetic field is able to re-establish
the near-degeneracy of T+ (or T–, depending
on the sign of J) and the S states, for which hyperfine-induced
spin mixing is again efficient (see Figure 2b; right scenario). For charge-transfer systems
studied here, J(r) can be estimated
from ET properties such as the charge recombination free energy, the
reorganization energy, the energy of the locally excited triplet state,
and the electron coupling matrix element.8,25 In
this case, the distance dependence of J(r), that is, the ξ-parameter, predominantly reflects the distance
dependence of (the square of) the ET coupling matrix element. For
the N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA)/9,10-dimethylanthracene
(DMAnt)-based system studied here, J is predicted
to be negative (following the convention as expressed in eq 2 below), that is, the scenario as
shown in Figure 2b
is likely relevant.8

The relative
diffusive motion of the radicals plays an important
role for the sizes of the MFEs of exciplexes. In several studies,
the solvent environment was varied to control this factor via the
static dielectric constant (εs) and the dynamic viscosity
(η).5,6,8−11,26−30 In nonpolar solvents, the spin mixing and, thus,
MFEs are often found to be impeded by the inability of the radical
pair to separate to a distance for which J is small.
If, on the other hand, the solvent polarity is high, the diffusive
separation might be efficient. Yet, for intermolecular systems, the
MFEs may still be small if the reencounter probability of the geminate
radicals is small. Consequently, maximal MFEs are often observed for
intermediate dielectric constants, for which the solvent polarity
is chosen to balance the radical separation and the reencounter probability.5,6,9−11 In micro-heterogeneous
solvent mixtures, these parameters can in addition be controlled via
the solvent structure, which can be optimized to elicit very large
MFEs.5,6,11

For
bridged intramolecular exciplex systems, the radicals cannot
separate freely and interesting MFEs are expected to emerge based
on the interplay of the exchange interaction and the radical dynamics
as confined by the bridge and steric requirements. In particular,
by interconnecting the fluorophore and the quencher moieties with
a flexible linker, the diffusive excursion of the radicals and their
limiting distances and thus the average exchange integral can be controlled.
By choosing a suitable chain length, MFEs that markedly exceed those
in freely diffusing systems have been realized. For pyrene–(CH2)m–DMA with m = 16, MFEs of approximately 45% have been reported.31 For linkers with m ≤ 8, the effect
of the exchange interaction is pronounced.32−40 In contrast to intermolecular systems and the long-chain analogues,
dips in the MFE versus magnetic field-curves are then observed as
a result of the S–T±-mixing process for nonzero
average J (i.e., as predicted by Figure 2b; right scenario). So far,
MFEs have only been observed for two classes of intramolecular exciplex
systems: pyrene/DMA30−32 and phenanthrene/DMA.33−38 MFEs in nonexciplex forming intramolecular radical pair systems
are comparably well studied.17,41−44

In this work, we describe the synthesis and MFEs of a new
class
of exciplex-forming donor–acceptor systems of the type 9-methylanthracene
(MAnt)–(CH2)n–O–CH2–CH2–DMA,
which feature chain-linked MAnt and DMA. The MFEs of these compounds
were studied using steady-state recordings of the exciplex emission.
The chain length and solvent polarity dependence of the MFEs was investigated
in homogenous binary solvent mixtures of propyl acetate (PA) and butyronitrile
(BN) with widely varying dielectric constants, εs, in the range from 6 to 24.7 (at 295 K; η = 0.58 cP). Propionitrile
(EtCN; εs = 28.3; η = 0.39 cP) and acetonitrile
(AN; εs = 36.0; η = 0.34 cP) were used to extend
the solvent polarity range. We model the field-dependence in the framework
of the semiclassical approximation and demonstrate under which conditions
a model employing ST-dephasing rather than a microscopic description
of the chain dynamics is sufficient to account for the MFEs.

Results
and Discussion
Permittivity-Dependent MFE on Exciplex Emission
Figure 3 depicts
the normalized
absorption and fluorescence spectra of MAnt-n-O-2-DMA and, for comparison, the intermolecular system DMAnt/DMA.
The vibronic transitions with Gaussian band shape of the exciplex
were extracted by employing a model as described in refs.8,45 The fluorescence
spectrum of the locally excited fluorophore was directly accessible
from the spectrum in the absence of the quencher moiety.

Figure 3 Absorption
and emission spectra of DMAnt/DMA (top; quencher concentration:
0.06 M) and MAnt-8-O-2-DMA (bottom). A mixture of
PA/BN with a dielectric constant of εs = 12 was used
as solvent. The emissions of the locally excited fluorophore moiety
and the exciplex are shaded in blue and red, respectively.

Figure 4 shows the
MFEs of the exciplexes of the chain-linked MAnt-n-O-2-DMA systems (n = 8, 10, 16)
in PA/BN mixtures, propionitrile (EtCN), and AN and compares them
to the effects observed for a freely diffusing system, which are available
from a previous study.9−11 We have not studied the permittivity dependence of
the n = 6 compound in detail as the MFE was found
to be very small (χE = 1.0% in BN; see below). The
MFEs have been determined from steady-state measurements at B0 = 75 mT and the Earth’s magnetic field
(B0 ≈ 0 mT) and corrected for background
fluorescence as detailed in eq 8. The used PA/BN binary mixtures are isoviscous and, thus,
allow a systematic assessment of the static dielectric constants of
the solvents, εs, unmitigated by effects of diffusivity.
For the freely diffusing donor–acceptor pair, no MFE has been
observed for εs < 7. For εs >
7, the MFE increases sharply and eventually assumes a maximum value
of χE = 14.5% at εs = 18, followed
by a monotonous decrease for εs > 18. For the
polar
solvents EtCN and AN, the emission of the intermolecular exciplex
is too weak to allow a reliable quantification of the MFE. These data
points have thus been omitted. For the linked systems, the onset of
the MFEs is observed for εs ≈ 10 and the effect
steadily increases with increasing dielectric constant in the PA/BN
mixtures. Independent of the chain length, the maximal effect is observed
for pure BN, εs = 24.7, for which we find χE = 9.4% for MAnt-8-O-2-DMA, χE = 17.8% for MAnt-10-O-2-DMA and χE = 37.5% for MAnt-16-O-2-DMA. Eventually, the MFE
is markedly lower for the more polar solvents EtCN and AN. In this
respect, our results differ from those for methylene-linked pyrene/DMA,
for which the MFE on the exciplex was found to increase in ethyl acetate/AN
mixtures up to εs = 37.5, that is, pure AN, without
going through a maximum.26,30 On the other hand,
a very similar permittivity dependence of the MFE was observed for
polymer-chain-linked pyrene–dimethylaniline in tetrahydrofuran/dimethylformamide
mixtures.13 Our observations can be understood
as follows: MFEs of exciplexes originate from the hyperfine-induced
intersystem crossing of RIPs, which may be produced directly in a
PET reaction or via dissociation of the exciplex (see Figure 1). Only if the component radicals
of the RIP can separate to distances for which the exchange interaction, J(r), is negligible compared with the HFIs
or, in the case of S–T±-mixing, comparable
to the Zeeman interaction, can the spin evolution proceed efficiently.
The increase of the MFE with increasing εs is usually
interpreted in terms of the accessibility of these magnetosensitive,
that is, separated or elongated, conformers/states:9−11 first, as we
have shown by a detailed analysis of the time-resolved MFEs of DMAnt/DMA,
the propensity for the system to directly form the exciplex from the
locally excited singlet state increases with decreasing εs, whereas the tendency of the exciplex to dissociate into
ions decreases. Taken together, this gives rise to a larger partition
of exciplex formation via magnetic field-independent pathways, a consequence
of which is that the MFE is decreased. Second, even if RPs are formed,
low permittivities/high viscosities will impede the separation of
the radicals to distances that allow favorable ISC and thus large
MFEs. As for the decrease of the MFE for EtCN (η = 0.39 cP)
and AcN (η = 0.34 cP), we observe that these solvents are less
viscous than the PA/BN mixtures (η = 0.58 cP).9−11 The associated increase in mobility is, however, not expected to
account for the decrease in the MFE. In fact, model calculations employing
the stochastic Liouville equation to incorporate the chain dynamics
and the distance dependence of the exchange interaction and back ET
rate suggest that for systems for which the average exchange interaction
is not substantial, the MFE increases with increasing mobility (see Figure 4 in ref (30)). On the other hand, the
decrease in the MFEs can be attributed to altered back ET rates (see Figure 1). Further, the reencounter
rate of the separated radicals could be decreased with increasing
permittivity because of increased charge shielding, such that the
pair loses its spin coherence (or is quenched by impurities) prior
to its reencounter.13 In this case, the
magnetosensitivity will be suppressed, as the magnetic field is too
weak to impact upon the equilibrium properties. This argument is frequently
employed in the context of freely diffusing radical pairs.7,12,46 Together with the increasing
accessibility of the magnetosensitive conformers discussed above,
a maximum in the permittivity dependence of the MFE is expected and
in fact observed. The maximum MFE values in the polymethylene ether-linked
systems with long chains (n = 10, 16) are larger
than the freely diffusing systems.9−11 This can be predominantly
attributed to an increased probability of geminate radical-pair recombination
in the bridged systems. For the short-chain systems, the effects of
the exchange interaction are expected to become more significant such
that the MFEs are reduced despite enhanced recombination probabilities.
In addition, the flexible linker is expected to impact the ratio of
direct exciplex versus RIP formation.23 Magnetic field-dependent measurements to be reported below suggest
that for n = 8, 10, and 16, the second argument applies
exclusively.

Figure 4 MFEs on the exciplexes from freely diffusing DMAnt/DMA
and chain-linked
MAnt-n-O-2-DMA as determined from
steady-state-luminescence measurements (semi-filled circles with error
bars) in PA/BN mixtures of various static dielectric constants (εs = 6 ÷ 24.7) and neat propionitrile (εs = 28.3) and AN (εs = 36.0).

Magnetic Field-Dependent Measurements
We have further
studied the MFEs of the exciplexes for MAnt-n-O-2-DMA as a function of the magnetic field intensity, B0. Figure 5 summarizes our results for neat BN. For n = 8, 10, and 16, the MFE increases monotonously with B0, which is in line with the radical pair mechanism in
the absence of a marked low-field effect. In particular, the spectral
response suggests a short-lived radical pair that does not experience
a significant exchange coupling during the diffusive excursions that
determine the MFEs. In this scenario, the MFE encompasses the coherent
mixing of the degenerate singlet (S) and triplet states (T+, T0, T–) at B0 ≈ 0 mT and S–T0 conversion at high-fields,
for which the T+ and T– states are energetically
detached by the Zeeman interaction. For the comparable model system
of methylene-linked pyrene/DMA, 12 or 11 intervening CH2-groups are necessary to similarly alleviate obvious extrema due
to a nonzero exchange coupling in AN and diethyleneglycol, respectively.26,30 As for MAnt-8-O-2-DMA comprises 11 atoms (10 methylene
groups and an ether oxygen atom), the two families of compounds appear
very similar. We have further extracted the B1/2-values, that is, the magnetic field values for which the
delayed exciplex fluorescence reaches half of its saturation relative
to B0 = 0 mT; for n =
8, 10, and 16, we determine this to be 18, 9.5, and 5.6 mT, respectively.
We observe that for n = 8 and 10, the B1/2-values are markedly larger than the corresponding
value for the free fluorophore–quencher-pair DMAnt/DMA in the
limit of low donor concentration (B1/2 = 5.3 mT).5,6 This can be attributed to a reduced
lifetime of the radical pair and/or singlet–triplet dephasing.
In fact, the lifetime effect has been suggested to lead to a broadening
of the MARY lines in a study of the micro-heterogeneous solvation
of the radical pair of DMAnt/DMA in DMSO/toluene mixtures, which likewise
promote large MFEs by increasing the reencounter probability.6 Singlet–triplet dephasing is the consequence
of the randomization of the S/T-coherences by a time-varying J(r) as caused by the molecular motion.5,6,47 Given that for n ≥ 8, no spectral fingerprints of an average exchange coupling
are revealed in Figure 5, the picture of brief random encounters with large exchange coupling,
interrupted by comparably long stretches of “free” evolution,
emerges. We note again that the exchange interaction decays exponentially
with the distance between two radicals. In the freely diffusing DMAnt/DMA
system, two radicals can separate freely to the region where the exchange
interaction is negligible during the majority of the coherent RP lifetime
such that its effect can be neglected. The fact that for n = 16, the B1/2-parameter is only marginally
larger than for the freely diffusing system suggests that for this
system, most of the diffusive excursion is taking place outside the
mutual sphere of influence of the donor–acceptor pair, despite
the linker. For the short-chain variant with n =
6, a completely different picture emerges: the MARY-spectrum shows
a pronounced tip with negative MFEs at B0 ≈ 10 mT with an amplitude that amounts to approximately −20%
of the saturated effect. The subsequent zero-crossing occurs at B0 ≈ 23 mT. This spectrum reflects a nonzero
average exchange interaction, which lifts the degeneracy of the S-
and T-states for B0 = 0. As a consequence
of this large S–T energy gap, HFI-induced intersystem crossing
is inefficient for B0 = 0 (Figure 2b). By applying an external
magnetic field matching the S–T energy gap, the degeneracy
of the T+-state and the S-state is restored (Figure 2b, right scenario). The once
more efficient conversion of singlet to triplet RIPs is revealed by
the dip in the exciplex luminescence intensity. In this discussion,
we have assumed that J(r) is negative
(for the convention as expressed by eq 2 below) in agreement with predictions from ref (8). A positive value has been
suggested for some RIPs.18,35,48 In this case, T+ and T– swap roles
without requiring a principal adjustment to the conclusion.

compounds MAnt-n-O-2-DMA with n = 6, 8, 10, and 16 on the external magnetic field intensity.
The MFEs were obtained by steady-state measurements of the exciplex
emission intensity at 550 nm using neat BN as solvent. The bottom
panel shows the MFEs normalized by their respective value at 80 mT.

We shall present a preliminary
analysis of the spin dynamics in
the MAnt-n-O-2-DMA. Here, we focus
on a description based on the single-site modified Liouville equation.
The effect of fluctuations in the exchange interaction will be accounted
for by introducing an effective spin dephasing term. More elaborate
descriptions accounting for the dynamics of the linker and the distance
dependence of the spin Hamiltonian and the back ET rate constants
have been suggested30,44,49−51 but are beyond the scope of this work. In fact, given
the multitude of unknown parameters fed into such calculations, a
more detailed study of the photophysical parameters should precede
any endeavor in this direction. We nonetheless argue that the simplified
approach employed here is valuable. This statement is supported by
the success of modeling-flexible biradicals by two-state models52−54 and the fact that the intermittently populated state of large J can be well-modeled in terms of singlet–triplet
dephasing as demonstrated in ref (55). Following this approach, the equation of motion
of the spin density matrix is 1  Here, Ĥ is the spin
Hamiltonian comprising the Zeeman, hyperfine, and the average exchange
interaction 2  with 3  The subscripts i and k label the radical and the nuclear spins, respectively. gi is the g-factor of the ith radical; ai,k represents the hyperfine
coupling constant of the kth nuclear spin in the ith radical. All other variables have their usual meanings.  accounts for spin selective
recombination
processes, that is, the formation of the exciplex or the ground-state
reactants with the combined rate kS and
the triplet excited state of MAnt with rate kT 4  where P̂S and P̂T are the singlet and triplet
projection operator, respectively. Note that in the context of this
work, kS and kT are effective rate constants that account for the elementary process
as well as the chain dynamics controlling the approach of the reactants.
Singlet–triplet dephasing (rate kST) is accounted for by47 5  

We do not
explicitly treat spin relaxation as these incoherent
processes are not expected
to be relevant on the timescale of tens of nanoseconds but we include
an abstract decay time (of the order of a typical relaxation time,
i.e., several hundreds of nanoseconds), τsc, to effectively
eliminate the contribution of radicals that are too long-lived to
remain spin correlated.

Because of the geometric growth of the
dimension of eq 1 with
the number of nuclear spins
in the two radicals (see eq 3), a numerical solution is challenging for all but the simplest
radical pairs. For this reason, we here invoke the semiclassical approximation
to solve eq 1 for the
accumulated density operator .18,56,57 Details of
this approach are summarized in the Supporting Information. The singlet yield is then given by 6  

Assuming
that the exciplex emission results from a field-independent
contribution φ0 and a field dependent contribution
related to eq 6 by φ1YS(B0), the MFE is eventually calculated from 7  where c = φ0/φ1 is a constant larger than
zero.

Using DFT-derived hyperfine coupling constants (summarized
Tables
S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) and a few assumptions on the typical size of pertinent parameters,
the outlined model can account for the field-dependence of the exciplex
emission of the MAnt–(CH2)n–O–CH2–CH2–DMA compounds with n ≥ 8. Figure 6 shows the fits to
the experimental MFEs obtained by systematically varying the singlet
recombination rate constant kS, the singlet–triplet
dephasing rate kST and c. Here, Jav ≈ 0 mT was assumed
as the MARY curves do not show discernible minima that could be accounted
for by S–T±-mixing. In addition, we have assumed
that kT significantly exceeds kS (in practice, we used kT = 10kS). This choice can be rationalized
by observing that the triplet recombination occurs in the Marcus-normal
region, while the singlet recombination is expected to be relatively
slow.8 This is attributed to the back ET
being located deep in the inverted region, and the fact that the exciplex
formation is tied to more stringent requirements with respect to the
stacking of the reactants than simple outer-sphere ET processes. Although
the data do not allow the determination of kT, it is noteworthy that the choice kS = kT did not provide a convincing
agreement with the experimental data. Further, τsc = 250 ns was used, which corresponds to the spin relaxation times
expected for organic radicals in solutions.58 The difference in g-factors was neglected as it
is too small to elicit discernible effects at the low magnetic field
intensities employed here. With these choices, the MFEs can be well-modeled
as is obvious from Figure 6. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 1 and reveal a singlet recombination
rate of kS ≈ 0.1–0.2 ns–1. While kS–1 ≈ 10 ns for n = 16 and n = 8, we find kS–1 ≈
5 ns for n = 10. In addition, c =
φ0/φ1 is smallest for n = 10. The found recombination rates also justify our initial choice
of refraining from an explicit modeling of spin relaxation. This is
due to the modulation of (predominantly) the HFIs by rotational diffusion,
which do not impact the MFEs on the short timescales relevant here.
On the other hand, singlet–triplet dephasing as resulting from
the modulation of the exchange coupling is found to be essential to
model the width of the MARY lines. kST increases strongly with decreasing n. For n = 8, the singlet–triplet coherence dephases on
the time-scale of nanoseconds. At the same time, c increases, suggesting that tightly bound (e.g., stacked) configurations
are sampled at a much higher rate for this compound than its homologs
of larger n. In Table 1 we also summarize the MFE for c =
0, that is, for the hypothetical scenario that the exciplex is exclusively
formed via magnetosensitive RIPs. With regard to these data, it is
interesting to note that the small MFEs for n = 8
are not the result of exceedingly fast singlet–triplet dephasing
but a larger propensity to form the exciplex via field-independent
channels.

Although this approach is obviously
valid for the compounds with n ≥ 8, the results
are less convincing for n = 6, as is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). While the model qualitatively accounts
for the dip in the MFEs once the average exchange interaction is increased
to |Jav| ≈ 5 mT, the predicted
curve levels off too fast to fully account for the experimental saturation
behavior. The best agreement is found for kST ≈ 1 ns–1, kS ≈ 0.1 ns–1, and c ≈
12. Interestingly, increasing kST decreases
the agreement with the experimental data by predominantly flattening
out the negative dip, rather than substantially increasing the (too
small) linewidth. On the basis of this observation, we suggest that
the broader magnetic field response observed for the n = 6 compound is likely due to strain in Jav rather than due to increased singlet–triplet dephasing. In
particular, contributions from configurations with larger exchange
coupling, that is, |Jav| ≈ 10 mT,
appear to be significant. Several interconverting populations of radical
pairs with variable J(r) will have
to be invoked to model the experimental data well; however, this is
beyond the scope of this paper. Eventually, note that, based on an
analysis summarized in ref (8), the exchange interaction is expected to be negative for
the studied compounds.

MFEs on the Locally Excited Fluorophore
In several
systems, the MFE on the fluorophore is accompanied by a comparable
MFE on the locally excited fluorophore. This originates from the fully
reversible inter-conversion between RIP, exciplex, and locally excited
fluorophore.7,8 Energetic factors, in particular,
the free energy gap between the exciplex and the fluorophore (Figure 1), determine the
exciplex–fluorophore reversibility. MFEs on the locally excited
fluorophores have been shown to be significant for the systems characterized
by an electron-transfer free-energy difference up to ΔGET = −0.35 eV, approximately.7,8 Assuming that the free energy of charge separation of the intramolecular
systems is comparable to that for the freely diffusing DMAnt/DMA (ΔGET = −0.28 eV), MFEs on the locally excited
fluorophore are expected. Figure 7 shows the results of wavelength-resolved MFE measurements of the MAnt-n-O-2-DMA (n = 8, 10, 16) in BN.
These action-spectra have been obtained from the emission spectra
in the absence and presence of a saturating magnetic field (B0 = 75 mT), I(B0 = 75 mT) and I(B0 = 0 mT), by calculating χ = I(B0 = 75 mT)/I(B0 = 0 mT) – 1; five scans in the presence and absence
of the external magnetic field have been recorded alternatingly and
averaged. All spectral data have been background corrected.

Figure 7 Wavelength-resolved
MFEs of the MAnt-n-O-2-DMA (n = 8, 10, 16) systems in BN.
χF and χE denote the MFEs on the
locally excited fluorophore and the exciplex, respectively.

As argued before, these MFEs on
the locally excited fluorophore
can neither be attributed to triplet–triplet annihilation (P-type
delayed fluorescence) nor thermal repopulation from the triplet state
(E-type).59 The former is insignificant
under the low-light, low-concentration conditions employed in the
experimental condition. The latter can be excluded because the energy
gap between the singlet and triplet states is large (ΔGST = 1.3 eV).7,8 For MAnt-16-O-2-DMA, the MFE on the exciplex is large (χE = 37.5%), and the reversible interconversion of the exciplex and
locally excited fluorophore is easily recognizable (χF = 2.2%). The MFE on the locally excited fluorophore of the MAnt-10-O-2-DMA system is 0.5%, whereas that of the MAnt-8-O-2-DMA system is absent (smaller than 0.1%). If we assume
a fast equilibrium of the exciplex and the locally excited fluorophore–quencher
pair, a naive argument suggests that the equilibrium constant of exciplex
formation is proportional to (χE/χF)(IE(B0 =
0)/IF(B0 =
0)). If we further assume that the radiative rate constants of the
exciplex and the locally excited fluorophore are comparable in all
compounds, we can use this quantity as measure of the reversibility
constant. For the studied compounds, both the ratio of χF/χE and IF/IE decrease with decreasing chain length, suggesting
that the free energy gap between the exciplex and the locally excited
fluorophore–quencher pair increased in the same direction.
In particular, assuming that the free energy of the locally excited
fluorophore state is unaltered by the length of the linker (as suggested
by the invariant emission spectra of the locally excited fluorophores),
this observation leads us to suggest that the exciplex is more stabilized
for the shorter chain. Likely this is a consequence of an intrinsic
alteration of the exciplexes, that is, a different way of stacking
of the aromatic rings, or an entropic effect. The entropy of exciplex
formation from the locally excited fluorophore–quencher pair
is expected to be more negative for the longer chained compound, as
the phase space volume corresponding to open configurations increases.
This has, in fact, been found (together with an accompanying change
in energy) for a similar intermolecular exciplex system with 9 and
11 bridge atoms.23 On the other hand, ring
strain is unlikely to be the cause of the observed free-energy changes,
as the strain does not change much with the ring size for the large
cycles at question.60 The change in free
energy is also reflected in the emission spectra of the exciplexes,
which are hypsochromically shifted as n increases
(see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, the solvent dependence of the exciplex emission maximum
shows that the degree of charge transfer is larger in the short-chain
exciplexes, that is, they resemble the ion pair more.

Conclusions
MFEs on the intramolecular exciplex fluorescence have been studied
for the new class of compounds MAnt-n-O-2-DMA (n = 6, 8, 10, 16). The effects are interpreted
in terms of the hyperfine and S/T+-level crossing mechanisms,
in which the magnetic field affects the S–T conversion within
the RIP by altering the energy gap of singlet and triplet states.
The MFE of the exciplex exhibits a strong dependence on the static
dielectric constants, εs, of the solvent. It initially
increases with increasing polarity of the solvent, attains a maximum
at εs ≈ 25, and eventually decreases for larger
solvent polarity. The solvent dependence of the MFE on the exciplex
was discussed based on the effect of the solvent polarity on the separation
and reencounter dynamics of the RIP and the partitioning of the quenching
pathways giving way to the exciplex and the RIP, respectively. The
size of the MFEs correlate strongly with the edge-to-edge distance
(r) of the two radicals. The largest effect was observed
for the long-chain derivative MAnt-16-O-2-DMA (χE = 37.5% at 75 mT). For n = 8, 10, and 16,
the average exchange coupling is negligible and the singlet and triplet
states of the RIP are nearly degenerate for most of their coherent
lifetime. Simulations of the MARY lineshape in BN using the semiclassical
theory reveal singlet recombination rates of the order of 0.1 ns–1 and various degrees of singlet–triplet dephasing
depending on the chain length. For n = 6, the singlet–triplet
conversion is impeded at B0 = 0 by a nonzero
average exchange coupling of |Jav| ≈
5 mT. In this case, a dip in the fluorescence intensity results from
S–T+-mixing at intermediate magnetic field intensities.
MFEs on the locally excited fluorophores have been shown to be significant
for the long-chain systems (n = 10, 16). This observation
can be attributed to the fully reversible interconversion between
RIP, exciplex, and locally excited fluorophore due to a small free
energy gap between the exciplex and the excited fluorophore quencher
pair. Our result suggests that the driving force of exciplex formation
from the locally excited fluorophore quencher pair increases with
decreasing chain length.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Chain-Linked
Fluorophore–Quencher Systems
Exemplary procedure for
2-[4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl]ethyl
10-[9-(10-methyl)anthryl]decyl ether
(MAnt-10-O-2-DMA): 1-bromo-10-[9-(10-methyl)anthryl]decane
(MAnt-10-Br, 0.65 g, 1.58 mmole) and 2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]ethanol
(0.56 g, 3.39 mmole) were added to the solution of 0.57 g NaH (60%
oil suspension) in N,N-dimethylacetamide
(15 mL). The mixture was stirred for 4 h in an ice bath at 273 K.
The resulting mixture was extracted with benzene (3 × 15 mL).
The combined benzene phases were washed by cold water (3 × 20
mL) and dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo.
The product was isolated by column chromatography on silica gel with n-hexane and an n-hexane/ethyl acetate
mixture (95:5) as the eluting solvent to obtain MAnt-10-O-2-DMA (0.25 g, 38% yield). Formula: C35H45ON, melting point: 328–329 K. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 8.6–7.4 ppm (8H, protons of the
anthracene moiety), 7.2–6.7 (4H, protons of benzene ring),
3.7–3.5 (4H, −CH2–O–CH2−), 3.45 (2H, −CH2–DMA), 3.1
(3H, CH3–anthracene), 2.95 (6H, (CH3)2N−), 2.8 (2H, −CH2–anthracene),
2.0–1.2 (16H, protons of the chain). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 125 MHz): δ 134–122 ppm (20C, aromatic carbons),
70–74 (4C, −CH2–O–CH2– and −N(CH3)2), 35–36
(3C, CH3–anthracence, −CH2–anthracene
and −CH2–benzene), 14–32 (8C, methylene
carbons). MS (EI) m/z: 495.35 (M+, 100). The linked fluorophore–quencher pairs of different
chain lengths (MAnt-n-O-2-DMA, n = 6, 8, 16) were prepared by an analogous procedure. See
the Supporting Information for synthetic
details including the preparation of precursors.

Solvents and
Sample Preparation
Solvent mixtures of
PA (Aldrich 99.5%, distilled under reduced pressure, εs = 6) and BN (BN, Fluka 99%, distilled under reduced pressure, εs = 24.7) allow for a systematic variation of the dielectric
constant εs in the range from 6 to 24.7 (295 K).
Mixtures of different εs-values were prepared observing
that εs = wPAεPA + (1 – wPA)εBN, where wPA is the weight fraction
of PA.9−11 For these mixtures, the viscosity (η) and the
refractive index (n) are almost independent of solvent
composition. Furthermore, the Pekar factor (1/n2 – 1/εs = 0.456 for εs = 15), which governs the outer-sphere ET reorganization energy and
thus the rate of ET processes, varies by only ±5% in the studied
εs range.9,45,61,62 In addition, neat propionitrile
(EtCN, Aldrich 99.5%, distilled under reduced pressure, εs = 28.3) and AN (Aldrich 99.8%, distilled under reduced pressure,
εs = 36.0) are used to extend the range of solvent
polarities. The concentration of ether-linked fluorophore–quencher
pairs was 2 × 10–5 M. Samples were prepared
in septa-sealed quartz cuvettes. To remove dissolved oxygen, all solutions
were bubbled with nitrogen for 15 min prior to measurements.

Steady-State
MFE Measurements
The MFEs on the intramolecular
exciplex emission were obtained by using the experimental setup described
in refs.9,11 The exciplex luminescence intensity was recorded at 550 nm, whereas
the fluorophore moiety was excited continuously at 374 nm. The fluorescence
intensity was sampled three times in the absence and presence of an
additional external magnetic field; the two conditions were alternated
and each was acquired for 60 s. All measurements were conducted at
295 K. Fluorescence signals have been background-corrected. The three
repetitions were analyzed independently and the experimental errors
were estimated according to the method described in refs.9,11 The MFE
is defined as the relative change of the fluorescence intensity of
the exciplex, IE(λem,
B0), in the presence of an external magnetic field relative
to the zero-field scenario. It was evaluated from 8  Here, I̅(λem, B0) and I̅(λem, B0 = 0) are the
mean intensities sampled over the 60 s intervals at λem in a saturating magnetic field (B0)
and in the absence (B0 = 0) of an additional
external magnetic field, respectively. I̅F(λem, B0 = 0)
is the residual emission of the locally excited fluorophore at the
emission wavelength λem in the absence of quencher. Ic and I0 are the
emission intensities of the locally excited fluorophore in the presence
and absence of the quencher, respectively, which have been obtained
from the decomposition of the spectrally resolved fluorescence spectra
in contributions from the fluorophore and the exciplex.  is the mean background intensity recorded
for a sample of only the solvent. The subtractive term in the denominator
accounts for the residual fluorescence of the locally excited fluorophore
at the wavelength used to monitor the exciplex emission. I0 has been determined from spectra of the dimethyl anthracene
recorded under the same experimental conditions and for the same concentration
as used in the actual experiments. This correction is crucial for
intermolecular exciplexes in polar solutions, for which the exciplex
emission is small.
