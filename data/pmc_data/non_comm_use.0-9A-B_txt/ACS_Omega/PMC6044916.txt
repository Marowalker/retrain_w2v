Mitochondrion
has emerged as one of the unconventional targets
in next-generation cancer therapy. Hence, small molecules targeting
mitochondria in cancer cells have immense potential in the next-generation
anticancer therapeutics. In this report, we have synthesized a library
of hydrazide–hydrazone-based small molecules and identified
a novel compound that induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
by inhibiting antiapoptotic B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins
followed by sequestration of proapoptotic cytochrome c. The new small molecule triggered programmed cell death (early and
late apoptosis) through cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and caspase-9/3
cleavage in HCT-116 colon cancer cells, confirmed by an array of fluorescence
confocal microscopy, cell sorting, and immunoblotting analysis. Furthermore,
cell viability studies have verified that the small molecule rendered
toxicity to a panel of colon cancer cells (HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW-620),
keeping healthy L929 fibroblast cells unharmed. The novel small molecule
has the potential to form a new understudied class of mitochondria
targeting anticancer agent.

1 Introduction
Colon
cancer is the third most devastating disease claiming nearly
0.7 million deaths per year globally.1,2 Numerous Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small-molecule drugs (5-fluorouracil,
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) are already in clinics for the treatment
of colon cancer patients under chemotherapy regimen.3−5 However, small-molecule anticancer drugs kill healthy cells along
with targeted cancer cells as a collateral damage to induce severe
toxic side effects to the patients. Moreover, most of the cancer cells
develop resistance mechanisms (intrinsic or extrinsic) to overcome
the effect of the drugs.6−9 Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel small
molecules to perturb unconventional subcellular targets as the next-generation
cancer therapeutics. In recent years, the understanding of biological
function beyond ATP (energy currency) generation prompted mitochondrion
as an alternative target for anticancer therapy.

Mitochondrion,
the powerhouse of the cells, is one of the most
important subcellular organelles that contains genomic materials and
plays a central role in innumerable cellular processes including bioenergetics,
metabolism, biosynthesis, signal transduction, and apoptosis.10−15 Subsequently, mitochondrial functions have been altered in different
types of cancers16−19 making mitochondrion as one of the unorthodox targets for cancer
chemotherapy.20−23 As a result, several conventional anticancer drugs were routed into
mitochondria for improving efficacy, evading drug resistance, and
reducing off-target toxicity.24−28 Recently, mitochondrion was found to play a crucial role in colon
cancer development and progression.29,30 Although natural
products and synthetic small molecules have evolved as powerful tools
to perturb and understand biological phenomena,31−34 development of novel small molecules
to impair mitochondrial functions selectively in cancer cells, especially
in colon cancer, remains a daunting task,35−37 hence mostly
underexplored.

In recent years, hydrazine, hydrazone, and hydrazide-based
compounds
having nitrogen–nitrogen (N–N) bond have emerged as
interesting natural and non-natural products.38,39 Similarly, hydrazide–hydrazone (−CO–NH–N=CH−)
derivatives (a fusion of hydrazide and hydrazone moieties) demonstrated
significant diverse biological effects including anti-inflammatory,
antibacterial, antimalarial, and anticancer activities (Scheme 1a).40−46 Although hydrazide–hydrazone derivatives have shown immense potential as future anticancer drug candidates, their
effect on mitochondrion (intrinsic program cell death mediator) in
cancer cells is completely unexplored.

To address this, herein,
we illustrate a short and easy synthesis
of hydrazide–hydrazone-based library. Screening of the library
members in colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW-620) yielded
a novel small molecule that can damage the mitochondria through Bcl-2
inhibition-mediated outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This mitochondrial
impairment released cytochrome c, generated reactive
oxygen species (ROS), and finally induced apoptosis through cell cycle
arrest and caspase-9/3 cleavage.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Hydrazide–Hydrazone
Library
and Characterization
The synthesis of hydrazide–hydrazone
library is described in Scheme 1b. First, benzoic acid derivatives (1a–f) are reacted with methanol in the presence of concentrated
sulfuric acid in refluxing condition to obtain the methyl esters (2a–f) in 87–93% yield. The methyl-benzoate
derivatives (2a–f) are further reacted
with hydrazine monohydrate in ethanol in the refluxing condition to
afford benzoic acid-based hydrazides (3a–f) in 80–85% yield (Figure S1). Finally, aromatic hydrazides (3a–f) are reacted with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of catalytic p-TsOH to generate hydrazide–hydrazone derivatives
(4) in 70–80% isolated yield. A library of 30
hydrazide–hydrazone compounds (5–34, Figure S2) is synthesized by
this strategy. Chemical structures of all of the library members are
confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and high-resolution
mass spectroscopy (HR-MS) (Figures S3–S92).

2.2 Screening of Hydrazide–Hydrazones in
Colon Cancer Cells
First, the hydrazide–hydrazones
are screened to check their ability to induce cell death in colon
cancer cells. As there is no previous study of hydrazide–hydrazone
derivatives in colon cancer cells, we intend to generate a single-point
data using one concentration for each compound in a high-throughput
screening method.47,48 We choose a high initial concentration
(30 μM) to avoid false-negative and false-positive hits at lower
concentration. Moreover, the nontoxic molecules in high concentration
should be easily eliminated for further studies. Hence, HCT-116, DLD-1,
and SW-620 colon cancer cells are treated with hydrazide–hydrazone
derivatives at 30 μM concentration and the cell viability is
assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay at 24 h after incubation. Interestingly, it was found
that only compound 28 (Scheme 1c, Figure S2)
induces 31.7 ± 1.7, 41.7 ± 3, and 35.4 ± 3.4% cell
viability in HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW-620 cells, respectively, at 30
μM concentrations (Figure 1a–c). The rest of the library members show negligible
cell death even at 30 μM after 24 h.

Figure 1 MTT assay of hydrazide–hydrazone
derivatives in (a) HCT-116,
(b) DLD-1, and (c) SW-620 cells at 30 μM concentration after
24 h of incubation. (d) Dose-dependent cell viability assay of compound 28 in HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW-620 cells at 24 h after incubation.

The dose-dependent cytotoxicity
of compound 28 is
estimated further in HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW-620 cells by MTT assay
24 h after incubation. Compound 28 demonstrates IC50 = 20.0 ± 2.7, 27.7 ± 1.8, and 20.5 ± 0.5
μM (with cell viability = 3.15 ± 0.9, 16.2 ± 2.4,
and 33.3 ± 2.6% at 50 μM) in HCT-116, DLD-1, and SW-620
cells, respectively (Figure 1d). To compare the potential of compound 28 to
induce cell death in colon cancer cells with other traditional chemotherapeutic
drugs used in clinics, we treat HCT-116 cells with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), camptothecin, and cisplatin in a dose-dependent manner for
24 h and evaluate the cell viability by the MTT assay. Interestingly,
it is observed that 5-FU, camptothecin, and cisplatin show a much
higher IC50 = 57.3 ± 3.6 μM (cell viability
= 57.3 ± 3.6% at 50 μM), 44.5 ± 2.9 μM (cell
viability = 44.5 ± 2.9% at 50 μM), and 24.6 ± 0.5
μM (cell viability = 33.9 ± 1.8% at 50 μM), respectively
(Figure S93). Furthermore, we want to check
if the dissociation components of compound 28 in the
acidic medium can induce cellular toxicity. Hence, HCT-116 cells are
treated with 2,6-difluorobenzohydrazide (3d in Figure S1) and 6-bromo-1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde
in a dose-dependent manner for 24 h, and the cell viability is measured
by the MTT assay. It is observed that both compounds show negligible
toxicity (Figure S94) toward HCT-116 cells.

One of the major challenges in the current cancer therapy is to
target cancer cells selectively while keeping normal healthy cells
unperturbed. To evaluate the effect in healthy cells, we treat L929
fibroblast cells with compound 28 in a dose-dependent
manner at 24 h after incubation. The cell viability is measured by
the MTT assay. Interestingly, compound 28 shows almost
no toxicity (cell viability = 96.67 ± 6.3%, n = 3, mean ± SEM) to L929 cells even at a higher concentration
of 100 μM (Figure S95). On the other
hand, cisplatin, camptothecin, and 5-FU shows dose-dependent toxicity
in L929 with 78.3, 63.5, and 72.0% cell viability, respectively, at
100 μM concentration at 24 h after incubation (Figure S96). These MTT assays provide a convincing evidence
that compound 28 can kill colon cancer cells much efficiently
compared to clinically approved traditional cytotoxic drugs while
keeping healthy cells unharmed.

We further characterize the
structure of the lead compound 28 by X-ray crystallography
(Scheme 1c). The purity
of compound 28 is also evaluated to be 98.6% by high-performance
liquid chromatography
(HPLC, Figure S97). The hydrazone and hydrazide
functionalities are known to be labile in an acidic medium.49 Hence, to be successful in targeting subcellular
organelles in colon cancer, compound 28 should be stable
in an acidic tumor environment. The stability of compound 28 in an acidic medium is further evaluated. Compound 28 is incubated in pH = 5.5 buffer for short (24 h) and longer (72
h) time, and its integrity is confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). From the MALDI-TOF spectroscopy
(Figures S98 and S99), the fact that compound 28 remains stable in an acidic milieu even after 72 h indicates
its potential for therapeutic application in cancer.

2.3 Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization
(MOMP)
One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is to resist
cellular death.50,51 Mitochondria play a crucial role
in controlling cancer cell death by inducing mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP).15,52−54 To evaluate the effect of compound 28 on mitochondria
in colon cancer cells, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) is investigated by JC1 assay. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine
iodide (JC1), a cationic carbocyanine dye, shows membrane potential-dependent
homing into mitochondria with a switch from green (∼525 nm)
to red (∼590 nm) in fluorescence emission by forming J-aggregates
(red fluorescence) in a higher concentration. We estimate the mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization by the increase in green/red fluorescent
intensity ratio.55 HCT-116 cells are treated
with compound 28 at 15 μM (sub-IC50 concentration
to avoid cell death, stress response, and morphology change) for 24
h and the cells stained with the JC1 dye. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM) is performed to visualize the live stained cells. Figure 2a shows that cells
treated with compound 28 induce a significant increase
in the green/red ratio (green/red = 1.06 ± 0.2) compared to control
nontreated cells (green/red = 0.51 ± 0.2) (Figure S100). This confocal microscopy of JC1 assay confirms
that compound 28 induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization.

Figure 2 Confocal
microscopy images of HCT-116 cells treated with compound 28 followed by (a) JC1 staining to observe mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and (b) calcein acetoxymethyl ester
(AM) staining to observe mitochondrial transition pore opening (MTPs).
Scale bar = 10 μm.

2.4 Mitochondrial Transition Pore (MTP) Formation
Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization leads to the opening
of mitochondrial transition pores (MTPs). Further opening of the MTPs
is assessed by calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein AM) assay, where
calcein AM penetrates into the cells and homes into cytosol and mitochondria.56 Subcellular esterases cleave acetoxymethyl esters
into acid functionality to release green fluorescent calcein, which
is quenched with the externally added CoCl2 while keeping
the mitochondrial calcein AM unperturbed. However, upon opening MTPs,
the mitochondrial calcein AM will be sequestered into cytosol, leading
to the production of green fluorescent calcein. To evaluate MTP formation,
HCT-116 cells are treated with compound 28 for 24 h and
stained with calcein AM and CoCl2. As the control, HCT-116
cells are treated with only calcein AM and CoCl2 without
compound 28. Live cells are further imaged with CLSM. Figure 2b confirms that compound 28 significantly increases the sequestration of green fluorescent
calcein in cytosol compared to the control cells. This calcein AM
assay evidently validates that compound 28 damages mitochondria
and opens up MTPs in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.

2.5 Induction of Mitochondrial Damage
Mitochondrial outer
membrane polarization and transition pore formation
diminish mitochondrial hyperpolarization. To evaluate whether compound 28 can reinstate the hyperpolarization of HCT-116 cells, we
perform tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) assay.57 Ideally, cancer cells acquire significantly
higher hyperpolarized Δψm, leading to the accumulation
of red fluorescent TMRM in control cells. However, compound 28 (15 μM) treatment for 24 h reverses the mitochondrial
hyperpolarization, leading to an efflux of TMRM from HCT-116 cells.
As a result, a significant reduction in red fluorescent intensity
is observed by CLSM (Figure 3a). The transition pore opening and reduction of Δψm mediated by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP) leads to mitochondrial structural damage.

of HCT-116 cells treated with compound 28 followed by
(a) staining with red fluorescent TMRM to evaluate
mitochondrial depolarization after treatment with compound 28 and (b) MitoTracker Red CMXRos to observe damaged mitochondrial
morphology. Scale bar = 10 μm. (c) Quantification of mitochondrial
area after treatment with compound 28 determined from
CLSM using Mito-Morphology macro and ImageJ analysis software.

We further estimate the damage
to the mitochondrial morphology
induced by compound 28. HCT-116 cells are treated with
compound 28 (15 μM) for 24 h and mitochondria are
stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos. Confocal microscopy images in Figure 3b exhibit that elongated
healthy mitochondrial morphology is visibly disrupted into punctated
structure (shown by white arrows), leading to mitochondrial damage
by compound 28 treatments. Further quantification of
the average mitochondrial area is performed by Mito-Morphology macro,
which measures mitochondrial elongation and morphology from confocal
images through an ImageJ analysis software.58 Mitochondrial average area for HCT-116 cells treated with compound 28 is found to be significantly less (9.54 ± 0.6 μm2, n = 3, mean ± SEM) compared to the
average mitochondrial area in control cells (25.8 ± 1.8 μm2, n = 3, mean ± SEM) (Figure 3c). These confocal microscopy
images clearly demonstrate that compound 28 damages mitochondria
by inducing MOMP.

2.6 Bcl-2 Inhibition
MOMP is tightly
controlled by the Bcl-2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) family proteins.53 As a result, small molecules inhibiting Bcl-2
proteins have emerged as potent anticancer drugs.59 To evaluate the effect on Bcl-2, we treat HCT-116 cells
with compound 28 for 24 h, and Bcl-2 protein is stained
with a green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 labeled antibody. The CLSM
images in Figures 4a and S101 confirm that compound 28 inhibits the expression of Bcl-2 proteins compared to nontreated
control cells. Furthermore, we estimate the expression of Bcl-2 by
western blot analysis. HCT-116 cells are treated with compound 28, and the expression of Bcl-2 protein is visualized by gel
electrophoresis. Figure 4b shows that compound 28 reduces the expression of Bcl-2
protein significantly compared to nontreated control cells. We also
quantify the expression of Bcl-2 from gel electrophoresis by normalizing
the respective GAPDH expression. It is observed that compound 28 reduces the expression of Bcl-2 1.2-fold compared to control
cells (Figure S102). These confocal microscopy
and protein expression from western blotting experiments confirm that
compound 28 induces mitochondrial damage by inhibiting
Bcl-2 proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane.

images of HCT-116 cells treated with compound 28 followed
by staining with green fluorescent Alexa Fluor
488 labeled Bcl-2 antibody. Scale bar = 10 μm. (b) Western blot
analysis to evaluate cytochrome c expression in HCT-116
cells after treatment with compound 28 for 24 h.

2.7 Cytochrome c Release
Mitochondrial damage directs the translocation
of proapoptotic cytochrome c from mitochondria into
the cytosol to trigger a programmed
cell death.15,60 To visualize the expression of
cytochrome c, HCT-116 cells are treated with compound 28 (15 μM) for 24 h and cytochrome c is stained with antibody tagged with green fluorescent Alexa Fluor
488. The confocal images (Figure 5a) evidently confirm that compound 28 induces
a significantly increased cytochrome c in cytosol
compared to nontreated control cells. Further, expression of cytochrome c is determined by western blot analysis after treatment
of HCT-116 cells with compound 28 (15 μM) for 24
h. Gel electrophoresis images (Figure 5b) demonstrate a significant increase in the expression
of cytochrome c in cells treated with compound 28 compared to control cells. We also quantify the expression
of cytochrome c from the western blot. It is found
that compound 28 treatment increases cytochrome c expression by 2.2-fold compared to the control cells (Figure S103). These confocal images and gel electrophoresis
assays demonstrate that compound 28 induces the release
of proapoptotic cytochrome c after mitochondrial
damage.

Fluor 488 labeled cytochrome c antibody. (b) Western
blot analysis to evaluate cytochrome c expression
in HCT-116 cells after treatment with compound 28 for
24 h. (c) Confocal images of HCT-116 cells stained with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA) to observe reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generated by compound 28 at 24 h after incubation.
Scale bar = 10 μm.

2.8 Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation
One of the hallmarks of mitochondrial damage through MOMP is the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).15 We evaluate the MOMP-mediated ROS generation by cell-permeable 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA) assay.61 H2DCFDA is a nonfluorescent probe, which upon cellular
internalization, gets hydrolyzed by esterases followed by oxidation
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to generate green fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF). To evaluate the ROS generation, HCT-116 cells are incubated
with compound 28 (15 μM) for 24 h followed by staining
the cells with H2DCFDA. The live cells are visualized by
confocal microscopy. Figure 5c unmistakably demonstrates that cells treated with compound 28 generates a significantly increased ROS, leading to the
production of a much improved green fluorescent DCF compared to control
cells. These CLSM images indicate that compound 28 generates
ROS through mitochondrial damage.

2.9 Cell
Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis Induction
Mitochondrial damage,
followed by the production of proapoptotic
cytochrome c and ROS, instigates cell cycle arrest
before apoptosis.62 We measure the cell
cycle arrest induced by compound 28 by fluorescence-activated
cell-sorting (FACS) analysis. HCT-116 cells are incubated with compound 28 (15 μM) for 24 h and cell cycle arrest is analyzed
by propidium iodide (PI)-labeled DNA. Flow cytometric analysis reveals
that compound 28 treatment leads to 24.3, 11.6, and 65.4%
cells into G0/G1, S1, and G2/M phase, respectively (Figure 6a). In contrast, 57.6, 25.4,
and only 17.1% cells are found in G0/G1, S1, and G2/M phase, respectively,
in nontreated control cells. These FACS analyses show evidently that
compound 28 arrests HCT-116 cells into the G2/M phase.

Figure 6 (a) Cell
cycle analysis by staining the DNA in HCT-116 cells with
PI at 24 h after incubation with compound 28. (b) Flow
cytometry analysis of HCT-116 cells after treatment with compound 28 for 24 and 48 h to observe apoptosis (lower left, lower
right, upper left, and upper right quadrants represent healthy, early
apoptotic, necrotic, and late apoptotic cells, respectively).

Subsequently, cell cycle arrest
pushes the cells into programmed
cell death or apoptosis.62 We further evaluate
the induction of apoptosis by FACS analysis. HCT-116 cells are treated
with compound 28 (15 μM) for 24 and 48 h followed
by staining apoptotic and necrotic cells by green fluorescent fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V (staining the flipped phosphatidylserine
at the outer surface of apoptotic cells) and red fluorescent PI (staining
the DNA of the late apoptotic and necrotic cells), respectively. After
24 h, with compound 28 treatment 78.4 and 13.4% cells
are found in early and late apoptosis stages respectively (Figure 6b, upper panel).
In comparison, only 0.2 and 0% cells are found in early and late apoptotic
stages, respectively, in control cells. Similarly, at 48 h after incubation,
38.7 and 31.8% cells are observed in early and late apoptotic stages
in compound 28 treatments, respectively (Figure 6b, lower panel). We anticipate
that prolonged exposure of colon cancer cells to mitochondria-damaging
compound 28 shifts the programmed cell death from early
to late stages of apoptosis. These FACS analyses demonstrate that
compound 28 induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells through
mitochondrial damage.

2.10 Caspase-9/3 and p53 Expression
Induction
of apoptosis in cancer cells activates the initiator caspase-9, which
further activates the activator caspase-3 after cleavage.63,64 We estimate the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 by western
blot analysis in HCT-116 cells at 24 h after incubation with compound 28 (15 μM). Gel electrophoresis reveals that compound 28 triggered the cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 compared
to control cells (Figure 7a). Further quantification from western blot shows that compound 28 reduces the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 by 1.6-
and 2.5-folds, respectively (Figure S104a). These gel electrophoresis studies undoubtedly exhibit that compound 28 induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cells through the cleavage
of caspase-9 and caspase-3.

Figure 7 (a) Western blot analysis to observe the expression
of (a) procaspase-9,
procaspase-3, and (b) p-53 in HCT-116 cells after treatment with compound 28 for 24 h.

Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is highly dependent on p53
protein,
which is one of the most important tumor suppressors.65 Moreover, Bcl-2 inhibition on mitochondria in colon cancer
triggers the cells into p53-driven apoptosis.66 Hence, we further evaluate the expression of p53 in mitochondrial
damage mediated by compound 28, followed by apoptosis.
We treat HCT-116 cells with compound 28 (15 μM)
for 24 h and assess the expression of p53 by western blot analysis.
The gel electrophoresis image in Figure 7b confirms that compound 28 remarkably
increases the expression of p53 compared to control cells. Further
quantification from gel electrophoresis shows that compound 28 increases the expression of p53 in HCT-116 cells 14.7-folds
compared to control cells (Figure S104b).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, this report
describes a straightforward and concise
synthesis of natural product-guided hydrazide–hydrazone-based
small-molecule library. One of the library members was discovered
to impair mitochondria by disrupting outer membrane through the inhibition
of Bcl-2 protein followed by production of reactive oxygen species.
This small molecule blocked the cell cycle in G2/M phase, cleaved
caspase-9/3, and increased p53 to stimulate programmed cell death
in colon cancer cells. This hydrazide–hydrazone-based small
molecule showed remarkable efficacy in a panel of colon cancer cell
lines, without collateral toxicity in healthy cells. We anticipated
this novel small molecule had the potential to become a tool to illuminate
mitochondrial biology and further optimization studies need to be
performed for translating it successfully into clinics as an anticancer
agent.

machine. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a BD FACS Calibur
flow cytometer. Each sample was done in triplicate.

4.2 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Benzoic
Acid Methyl Esters (2a–f)
Substituted
benzoic acids (0.5 g) were dissolved in absolute methanol (8 mL),
followed by the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid (0.3 mL). The
reaction mixture was refluxed, and the progress of the reaction was
monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After completion of
the reaction, methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. To the
residue aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (15 mL)
was added, extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL), and washed
with saturated NaCl solution (2 × 10 mL). The organic layer was
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the organic
solvent was evaporated to get methyl esters of substituted benzoic
acid in 87–93% yield as a light yellow viscous liquid.

4.3 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Benzoic
Acid Hydrazides (3a–f)
Substituted benzoic
acid methyl esters (2a–f) (0.4 g,
1 equiv) were dissolved in absolute ethanol (3 mL) and hydrazine monohydrate
(1.183 mL, 10 equiv) was added into it. The reaction was refluxed
and monitored by TLC. After the completion of the reaction, ethanol
was evaporated. To the residue, ice-cold water (10 mL) was added and
the organic layer was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 20
mL). The organic layer was further washed with saturated NaCl solution
(2 × 10 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was evaporated. Finally, the
crude product was recrystallized (ethanol–water) to obtain
the desired hydrazides in 80–85% yield.

4.4 General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Hydrazide–Hydrazone
Derivatives (5–34)
To the solution of
substituted benzoic acid hydrazides (3) (0.1 g, 1 equiv)
in absolute methanol (1.5 mL), different aromatic aldehydes (1 equiv)
were added, followed by the addition of catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid (pTsOH). After stirring
for 2 h at room temperature, methanol was evaporated under reduced
pressure. To the residue, aqueous 10% NaHCO3 (10 mL) was
added and the organic layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 ×
10 mL) followed by washing with saturated NaCl solution (2 ×
10 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was evaporated. Final compounds were purified
by using column chromatography on the basic aluminum oxide (Al2O3) (ethyl acetate/hexane = 20%) to give hydrazide–hydrazone
derivatives in 70–80% yield.

4.5 HPLC
Analysis
The purity of compound 28 was determined
by reverse phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a 4.6 × 250 mm 5 μm C18
column using acetonitrile/water with gradient for 10 min. The sample
(20 μL) was injected (concentration = 1 mg/mL) into the column
with 1 mL/min flow rate.

4.6 Cell Viability Assay
Five thousand
colorectal cancer cells (DLD-1, HCT-116, and SW-620) were seeded per
well in a 96-well plate for attachment. To screen all of the compounds,
3 mM stock solutions of all of the compounds were prepared in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). The cells were then treated with all of the compounds
(30 μM) for 24 h. For calculation of IC50, the cells
were treated with compound 28 in different concentrations
(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.5, 25, and 50 μM). Cell
viability was determined by adopting the previously described procedure.67

For fibroblast cells, 10 000 L929
(murine lung fibroblast) cells were plated in each well of a 96-well
plate and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight.
Drug dilutions were made in complete 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing
DMEM media. Hundred microliter of each drug solutions (diluted in
DMSO) was added in each well of the 96-well plate (in triplicates).
Untreated cells (without any drug) were considered as control. After
adding drugs, the cells were incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, media
were aspirated and 100 μL MTT reagent (10 μL of 5 mg/mL
solution and 90 μL sterile media) was added in each well. It
was incubated for 3 h. Finally, all of the media were aspirated. Formazan
crystals were dissolved in100 μL DMSO and read in a plate reader
having 550 nm cutoff filter. Percent cell death calculation data were
normalized with untreated cells. Each data represent an average of
3 data points. Error calculated as standard error following (STDEV/(SQRT(3)))
using Microsoft excel.

4.7 Confocal Laser Scanning
Microscopy (CLSM)
1.5 × 104 HCT-116 cells
were seeded in each well
in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides for attachment. Compound 28 (15 μM) was incubated with the cells for 24 h. Control cells
were not treated with any compound.

4.7.1 JC1
Assay
Cells were washed thoroughly
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by the addition of JC1
dye to incubate for 20 min. The green and red fluorescently labeled
cells were seen and quantified by confocal microscopy.68

4.7.2 Calcein AM Assay
After 24 h, calcein
AM (1 μM) and 1 mM CoCl2 were added into the cells,
followed by imaging through confocal microscopy.68

4.7.3 Mitochondrial Morphology
Assay
After 24 h of incubation with compound 28, the cells
were washed thoroughly with PBS and stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos
for 20 min. The cells were then treated with paraformaldehyde (4%)
for 10 min and visualized and quantified by CLSM.67

4.7.4 ROS Generation by DCFH-DA
Assay
After treatment with compound 28, the
cells were then
washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and treated with DCFH-DA for 15 min. Finally,
the cells were washed thrice with PBS (pH 7.4) and visualized by CLSM.

4.7.5 TMRM Assay
The cells were washed
with cold PBS 3 times and treated with TMRM (10 μM/mL) for 30
min. The cells were then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and imaged by CLSM
to visualize mitochondrial damage.

4.7.6 Immunostaining
To Visualize Cytochrome c
5 × 104 HCT-116 cells were attached
on the coverslip in a 6-well plate followed by incubation with compound 28 for 24 h. The cells were thoroughly rinsed with PBS and
fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 10 min. The cells were then further
washed and permeabilized by blocking buffer. The cells were then treated
with cytochrome c primary antibody solution (1:100
dilution) for 3 h. After further washing with blocking buffer, the
cells were treated with a Alexa Fluor 488 labeled secondary antibody
solution (1:500 dilution) for 30 min in dark. Fluorescently labeled
cells were visualized further by CLSM.67

4.7.7 Immunostaining To Visualize Bcl-2
After treatment with compound 28, the cells were washed
once with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for
15 min. The cells were further washed twice with PBS (pH = 7.4) and
permeabilized by incubating in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.3%
Tween and 5% FBS) at room temperature. The cells were then incubated
in Bcl-2 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 1:100
dilution at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were washed thrice with
blocking buffer followed by incubation in Alexa Fluor 488 antimouse
IgG secondary antibody solution (1:500 dilutions) at 37 °C for
40 min in the dark. The cells were washed thrice with PBS and mounted
on a glass slide using SlowFade Gold antifade reagent. The slides
were subjected to fluorescence imaging using CLSM.

4.8 General Procedure for Western Blot Analysis
1 ×
105 HCT-116 cells were treated with compound 28 for 24 h followed by cell lysis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate respective
proteins and transferred them onto the membrane by electroblotting.
The protein-containing membranes were blocked and incubated with primary
antibodies for 24 h at 4 °C. Further, the membrane was washed
and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Proteins
were then detected and quantified by an ImageQuant LAS 4000 and an
ImageJ software.67,68

4.9 Fluorescence-Activated
Cell-Sorting (FACS)
Assay
HCT-116 cells (2 × 106 cell per well)
were attached in 6-well plates and then treated with compound 28 for 24 h at 15 μM.

4.9.1 Apoptosis
Detection
The cells were
detached by using trypsin and washed with PBS. The suspended cells
were then incubated with Annexin V-FITC Staining Kit using the manufacturer’s
protocol. The apoptotic and necrotic cells were quantified by using
a BD Accuri c6 flow cytometer.67

4.9.2 Cell Cycle Analysis
After treatment
with compound 28, the cells were then harvested and washed
with 1 mL PBS (pH = 7.4) and centrifuged at 850 rpm for 4 min. After
discarding the supernatant, the cells was fixed with cold 70% EtOH
for 0.5 h. The cells were washed thoroughly with PBS, followed by
the addition of 500 μL staining solution. A BD Accuri C6 flow
cytometer was used for cell cycle analysis.67
