Nowadays, there is an effort to increase the more widespread
use of biofuels that are a renewable energy source in transportation
and an alternative to conventional, petroleum-based fuels. These biofuels
include alcohols such as biomethanol, bioethanol, and biobutanol that
have a high octane number, but generally different physical and chemical
properties than petroleum fuels. The different properties of alcohols
may cause low material compatibility with carbon steel. Here, we used
cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) to study the behavior of
carbon steel in an environment of alcohols and alcohol–gasoline
blends (AGBs). Using CPP, we proved that the corrosion of mild steel
can be significantly influenced by alcohol properties, such as the
chain length, pKa, and solubility of oxygen
and water. In the environment of pure alcohols (not blended by gasoline),
a very good passivation ability of steel was proven, especially for n-butanol. In AGBs, steel corrosion can also be influenced
by the gasoline amount. When these pure alcohols or their gasoline
blends are contaminated by water-containing chlorides and organic
acids, the corrosion rate of carbon steel can increase by up to 4
orders of magnitude. In an anhydrous environment of alcohols, the
CPP can give results with a very good informative value.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The increasing global
energy demands, limited world fossil fuel reserves, and efforts to
improve air quality have led society to look for alternative energy
sources that could partially replace fossil sources and contribute
to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels produced from biomass
are one of the alternatives to conventional petroleum-based fuels.
Biomethanol, bioethanol, and biobutanol with high octane numbers are
a suitable variant of biofuels for petrol engines.

Biomethanol
can be produced from synthesis gas obtained by biomass gasification.
However, this option is not widely represented thus far as its production
from the biomass is roughly twice as expensive as that from natural
gas.1 Biomethanol can either be used as
a pure M100 fuel or as mixed M85 or M15 fuels. The high oxygen content
and the associated low-energy content, high material incompatibility,
and the formation of azeotropes with hydrocarbons are the main disadvantages
of biomethanol.1

Bioethanol is most
widely used especially in Brazil, where nearly 20% of cars burn pure
ethanol (E100 azeotrope), while the rest of the car fleet is adapted
to use E22 and E85 fuels.2,3 Ethanol–gasoline
blends (EGBs) are widely used in the US and the EU as well, mostly
in the form of E10 and E85 fuels. In the Czech Republic, gasolines
with an ethanol content of up to 5 vol % and E85 fuels are being used,
and the implementation of E10 fuels from 2019 is being considered.
The use of (bio)ethanol as a transportation fuel is associated with
a number of technical problems.4−7 Because of the application of EGBs in transportation,
high demands are placed on their quality and material compatibility.
The increased corrosion aggressiveness of EGBs and alcohol–gasoline
blends (AGBs), in general, is given by the ability of alcohols to
increase the conductivity and water solubility in these blends.4,8−10 Acidic substances, which may result from the oxidation
of some unsaturated hydrocarbons gasolines, may significantly increase
the aggressiveness of AGBs also.10 Furthermore,
chlorides that may come from the alcohol production or secondary contamination
may have a major impact on the aggressiveness of AGBs as well.9 The corrosive effects mainly show up on the metal
components of the fuel systems and internal engine components, such
as the fuel tanks or cylinder walls.5

Biobutanol is another prospective biocomponent potentially applicable
in AGBs.11 Biobutanol has about a 31% higher
energy content than ethanol and it can be added into gasolines in
the amounts of up to 10 vol % so that the criteria for the upper limit
for the oxygen content (2.7 wt %) set by the EN 228 standard are still
met.12 In comparison with conventional
petroleum-based gasolines and EGBs, biobutanol and biobutanol-based
fuels are safer as they evaporate less at higher temperatures.11 Butanol absorbs less water than ethanol and
is, thus, less corrosive. Like ethanol, butanol biodegrades well and
does not represent an environmental burden-like conventional gasolines.13

A number of publications deal with the
corrosion properties of AGBs, especially those with methanol14−17 or ethanol9,10,17−25 as an alcohol component. There are several methods applicable for
corrosion studies. These methods can be divided into gravimetric26,27 and electrochemical.6,9,10,14−25,27 The gravimetric methods typically
have low demands on experimental equipment, but they are typically
time-consuming. Conversely, electrochemical methods typically have
higher demands on experimental equipment, but they are time-efficient
and can provide more information about the ongoing corrosion processes.27 Open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements,14,20,21 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS),9,10,18,19 or polarization characteristics measurements,15,22 such as cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP),17,19,20,22 are examples of the electrochemical methods applicable for the corrosion
studies of AGBs. Several studies have been carried out to describe
the effects of chlorides, water, pH, and the dissolved oxygen content
in ethanol and EGBs on the corrosion of low-alloy steel and aluminum
alloys using CPP in a three-electrode arrangement.14−25 This work deals with the use of potentiodynamic polarization to
study the mild steel corrosion in an environment of different alcohols
(methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol), and
AGBs. Also, the effect of the contamination of these environments
with water, chlorides, and acetic acid was studied.

An overview
of the basic chemical–physical properties of methanol, ethanol,
isopropanol, and n-butanol, which have a major influence
on their aggressiveness, is compared in Table 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Stabilization of the Corrosion Potential of
an Open Circuit
Figure 1 illustrates the selected records of the OCP stabilization
for 1 h. From the records of the OCP in the environments of the pure
methanol, pure ethanol, and ethanol containing a 6 vol % of water,
the potential increase in time is obvious but without any higher fluctuations
that could indicate the potential corrosion of mild steel. This OCP
increase in time is associated with the consumption of the dissolved
oxygen in the environment, where the formation of oxides in the form
of a film on the mild steel surface occurs, and the surface is, thus,
partially protected against further corrosion. This phenomenon does
not occur in the methanol containing a 6 vol % of water. Thus, it
is likely that, in this environment, the corrosion resistance of the
mild steel will be the lowest and consequently, the susceptibility
of the mild steel to corrosion will be the highest. This conclusion
is supported by the OCP curve, for which a slight potential decrease
can be observed; the corrosion potential is rapidly stabilized at
its lowest value and the OCP is not as smooth as in the previous cases.
It can be assumed that with an increasing water content, the OCP record
would further decrease. This phenomenon may be caused by the occurrence
of surface and pitting corrosion due to the presence of chlorides.
The lowest potentials, in both methanol and ethanol, were measured
after their contamination. For methanol, the influence of water on
the change in the environment aggressiveness was significantly higher
than for ethanol. The presence of water plays an essential role in
the change of the solvent structure and its physical and chemical
properties such as the dielectric constant, oxygen content, and proton
activity. Shchukarev and Tolmacheva,29 who
studied ethanol–water environments, report that the concentration
of the dissolved oxygen decreased with the increasing water content
in the ethanol–water environments. The combination of all these
effects, caused by the presence of the water in the ethanol (but in
the methanol also), leads to a significant change in the reaction
rates of the total corrosion and the passivation mechanism.

methanol and ethanol with no contamination and with contamination

2.2 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
As a result of the relatively high polarity of alcohols which do
not exhibit high environmental resistance and have sufficient conductivity,
all of the measured impedance spectra had, in the complex plane, the
form of two relatively well-separated half circles centered below
the real axis. Thus, the spectra consisted of high- and low-frequency
parts; see Figure 2. The high-frequency part corresponds to the impedance response (the
so-called spatial impedance) that is associated with the environment
properties such as resistivity and relative permittivity. The low-frequency
part is related to the response of the electric double layer at the
phase interface and the polarization resistance of the material. The
polarization resistance is the basic corrosion variable characterizing
the instantaneous corrosion rate.

Figure 2 Impedance spectra of the mild steel measured
in the environments of the M60 and E60 fuels; the equivalent circuit
used to evaluate the low-frequency spectra parts is shown inside the
figure: Rfuel is the environmental resistance, Rp is the polarization resistance, and CPEdl is the CPE related to the loss capacitance of the electric
double layer.

The evaluation was performed by the approximation
of the low-frequency experimental data of the impedance spectra using
an equivalent circuit consisting of a series of polarization resistance
of the environment Rs, and a parallelly
connected polarization resistance Rp with
a constant phase element (CPE). The impedance of this circuit can
be expressed using eq 1. 1  Q is a CPE coefficient, n is a CPE exponent, ω is the angular frequency, and
j is an imaginary unit. All of the evaluated data are presented in Table 2.

From Table 2, it is obvious that the resistivity of the alcohols Rs was increasing with the increasing carbon
number in the molecule of the alcohols. This resistivity decrease
in a series is in accordance with the decreasing relative permittivity
of alcohols that act less as a dielectric with an increasing carbon
number in the molecule; see Table 1. The increase in the resistivity was significantly
influenced by the addition of the gasoline that has very low permittivity
(see Table 1) and very
high resistivity (in the order of GΩ·cm).9,10 On the contrary, the contamination of the alcohols and AGBs by an
aqueous solution of acids and salts resulted in a significant resistivity
decrease. Water, salts, and acids are generally problematic in biofuel
blends and can cause high financial losses for the production, transport,
and storage facilities.9 Water and salts
can come as primary or secondary contaminants either from the alcohol
production or they can result from a violation of good transportation
and storage practices. Acids can be formed as oxidation products during
the long-term storage of AGBs.10 Water
with its high relative permittivity (80) and high conductivity, especially
when contaminated by salts and organic acids, can significantly influence
the conductivity of the resulting fuel blends, which is reflected
in a decrease in the resistance of the contaminated alcohols or their
blends with gasoline, by up to 2 orders of magnitude. The decrease
in the resistivity is manifested by the considerable aggressiveness
and the low resistance of the mild steel in such an environment. This
is documented by low polarization resistances REIS,p and increasing capacitances of an electric double layer Cdl (that are easier to form at the metal-environment
interfaces in a more conductive and polar environment with higher
ionic strength; see Table 2). Capacitance Cdl corresponds
to an imperfect capacitor. This imperfection is characterized by the n-parameter that describes the distribution of the electric
double layer on the electrode surface and depends, for example, on
the surface homogeneity.

2.3 Cyclic Potentiodynamic Polarization
All calculated and evaluated data from the CPP after the iR drop compensation are summarized in Table 3. The first part of this table
presents the results from the CPP curve parts that were measured by
the shift from the cathode to anode potentials. The second part of
the table presents the data that were evaluated from the reverse polarization
parts of the CPP curves to which an opposite potential shift corresponds
than the one in the previous case, that is, from the anode to cathode
values. These results are subsequently discussed in the following
subsections of this section.

a The corrosion current density and
corrosion rate calculated using the polarization resistance REIS,p is measured using EIS before the CPP measurement;
see Table 2.

b The corrosion current density calculated
using the polarization resistance RCPP,p is evaluated from the relevant CPP part.

It has to be mentioned that during the measurement
of the cathode–anode CPP parts during the shift of the potentials
to the anode area, substantial surface changes to the mild steel were
observed that can influence and, thus, distort the evaluated data
from the reverse polarization. The βc, βa, Rrp, and irp data presented in the second part of the table have, thus,
a rather illustrative character and cannot be understood as absolute.

2.3.1 Influence of the iR Drop
on the CPP and Its Compensation
The iR drop
is a potential loss that is caused by the environmental resistance
and cell geometry (it reflects the distance between the working and
the reference electrode). Initially, the possibility of an automatic iR drop compensation was tested, but this method was found
to be unfeasible for the measurement as the resistance of the environmental Rs was too high, and this led to the overcompensation
of the iR drop. For the CPP curves, it was necessary
to additionally perform the iR drop compensation
after measuring the curves without the automatic compensation. The
potential loss can significantly influence the curve course and result
in a curve deformation as demonstrated on Figure 3. For the iR drop subtraction,
the environmental resistance Rs, obtained
by the evaluation of the EIS spectra measured before the CPP measurement
for each steel-environment system, was applied. The values of this Rs resistance are presented in Table 2.

Figure 3 Influence of iR drop on the CPP curve of mild steel in the environment
of (a) methanol with 6 vol % of water and 40 mg/kg of sodium chloride,
(b) n-butanol–gasoline blend B80.

From the agreement of the polarization resistances
of the mild steel REIS,p (evaluated from
the EIS spectra) and (evaluated from the CPP after the iR drop compensation) presented in Tables 3 and 4, it can be
concluded that the iR drop can be very well compensated
additionally (ex post) in many cases with a minimum error. In particular,
this is above expectations especially in the less conductive environments
such as the uncontaminated alcohols and uncontaminated AGBs, where
the iR drop values are the highest. In this case,
high polarization resistances, which are stable at the time during
the experiment, probably contribute to the good agreement of the results.
The mild steel corrosion occurs at a minimum rate that has no significant
effect on the system change during the experiment. The differences
in the REIS,p and RCPP,p resistances by 1 order of magnitude occur especially
in conductive environments (the contaminated alcohols and AGBs), where
the resistance of the mild steel is low and the corrosion rate is
high. Because of the relatively low environmental resistance Rs of the contaminated alcohols and their gasoline
blends, the deformation of the CPP curves due to the iR drop is lower and more exhibited for the reverse polarization curve;
see Figure 3. The difference
between the REIS,p and RCPP,p resistances at the level of 1 order of magnitude
can be especially caused by the time development of the polarization
resistance of the mild steel during the short term of the whole experiment.
This change in the polarization resistance over a short time period
can be then reflected in the CPP. In the following text, the CPP curves
with the iR drop compensation are presented.

2.3.2 Influence of Alcohol Chain Length on Its
Aggressiveness and Resistance of Mild Steel
Mild steel in
the presence of pure and anhydrous alcohols has very good corrosion
resistance and, thus, a low corrosion rate that is very similar for
the many alcohols tested; see Table 4. The low aggressiveness of the pure and anhydrous
alcohols is also evidenced by a slight shift in the cathode–anode
CPP parts toward lower corrosion current densities in dependence on
the growing alcohol chain; see Figure 4. According to the CPP records presented in Figure 4, it is obvious that
the corrosion potential of the mild steel Ecorr shifts toward negative values of the potential with the growing
alcohol chain; also, see Table 3. The Ecorr values are consistent
with the theory and with the increasing pKa values of the alcohols with the decreasing carbon number in the
molecule; see Table 1. Methanol (the highest value of Ecorr = −30 mV), which has a lower pKa than butanol (the highest value of Ecorr = −223 mV), more easily cleaves the proton and its higher
activity results in shifting the CPP curve toward the more positive
values of the potential. The CPP shift toward the more negative values
can be influenced by the amount of dissolved oxygen that is easily
involved in the depolarization reactions, and its solubility increases
with the increasing length of the alcohol chain; see Table 1.

steel measured in pure alcohols.

With the increasing length of the alcohol chain,
we also observed the shift of the Erp of
the steel for the reverse polarization curves toward more positive
values of the potential, where the steel is in a passive state; see Figure 4. The increasing
resistance of the mild steel and the decreasing alcohol aggressiveness
is documented by the increasing difference between the Ecorr and Erp potentials. The
lowest difference of the potentials was measured in methanol, where
the corrosion resistance of the steel is the lowest in contrast to
the steel-butanol system; see Figure 4. During the passivation of steel in an environment
of alcohols, the consumption of the dissolved oxygen occurs. On the
surface of the steel, a layer of insoluble oxides (corrosion products)
is formed, and this protects the steel against further corrosion.
With the increasing amount of dissolved oxygen, which is the highest
in butanol, the steel passivation appears to be easier and more intense.
These conclusions are supported by the overall course of the CPP curves
shown in ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and butanol in Figure 4. In all these alcohols, no
shift toward higher current densities occurs at the reverse polarization.
The current densities at the reverse polarization are lower and no
hystereses are formed unlike methanol. The highest activity of the
H+ protons and the lowest oxygen solubility in the methanol
at the same time results in (i) a significant shift of the repassivation
part of the CPP toward higher current densities (see the one order
of magnitude higher values of irp than icorr in Table 3) and (ii) the formation of a hysteresis loop at higher
current densities. The size of the hysteresis loop is related to the
surface changes during the anodic reaction, to the development of
the extensive surface or pitting corrosion, and it also indicates
a low passivation ability of the steel in the given environment.

2.3.3 AGBs and Their Aggressiveness on Mild Steel
Gasoline added to the alcohols has, in many cases, a similar influence,
and it has a positive effect on the repassivation kinetics of the
steel; see Table 3.
The measured corrosion rates of the mild steel are lower than in the
environment of the pure alcohols. The addition of gasoline to the
methanol and ethanol and the corrosion and repassivation potential
of the mild steel Ecorr and Erp are influenced similarly; see Figure 5. With the increasing gasoline content in
the AGBs, the corrosion potential is shifted toward more negative
values. Conversely, the repassivation potential shows an upward trend
up to the positive values. This effect is probably related to the
increasing solubility of oxygen in the blend, which increases with
the increasing gasoline content, in which oxygen is more soluble than
in the pure alcohols; see Table 1. Oxygen participates in the depolarization cathode
reactions, and their course is influenced by the amount of the dissolved
oxygen in the environment. The oxygen depolarization can occur according
to the reaction presented below  

Figure 5 CPP curves of the mild steel measured in methanol
(a) and ethanol (b) in the gasoline blends.

At a higher concentration of the dissolved oxygen
in a blend, more OH– ions are formed during the
oxygen depolarization and this results in the shift of the Ecorr toward more negative values. The influence
of the dissolved oxygen on the course of depolarization reactions
is also evidenced by the lower Ecorr values
of the mild steel (Figure 5b and Table 3) in the EGBs. In the EGBs, the amount of the dissolved oxygen is
higher than in the methanol–gasoline blends (MGBs) as the oxygen
solubility in the methanol is lower than in the ethanol, see sub-section 2.3.2 and Figure 4.

The higher
differences between Ecorr and Erp in Figure 5b in comparison with Figure 5a indicate a better passivation ability of
mild steel in an EGB; see also Table 3. The higher passivation ability of the steel in the
EGBs and lower corrosion aggressiveness of the EGBs is also obvious
from the overall CPP course, where the mild steel shows lower values
of the anode current density at the reverse polarization (see Figure 5b) in comparison
with the MGBs. Conversely, Figure 5 clearly illustrates the higher anode current density
at the reverse polarization and hysteresis at higher current densities
which decreases with the increasing amount of gasoline in the MGBs.
These conclusions can be also supported by the values of irp in Table 3, where 1 order of magnitude higher values was measured in the MGBs.
The lower irp values are associated with
the higher passivation ability and the formation of a protective layer
on the steel surface that is not soluble in the environment.

2.3.4 Influence of the Contamination of Alcohols
and AGBs
According to polarization characteristics and corrosion
rates presented in Table 3, the contamination of alcohols and AGBs had a substantial
influence on their corrosion aggressiveness and resistance of the
mild steel which is in accordance with the data published previously
for EGBs.10

The electrochemical behavior
of the mild steel in methanol and the influence of the contained water
and chlorides is obvious from Figure 6a. The relevant graph confirms the results of the OCP
measurements that were discussed in Section 2.1. The addition of a 6
vol % of water with 40 mg/L of sodium chloride influences the shift
of the corrosion potential toward negative values and, at the same
time, the shift of the entire curve to higher current densities which
is evidence of an increasing corrosion rate; see Table 3. The hysteresis loop presented
in Figure 6a and polarization
data evaluated from the reverse polarization in Table 3 indicate the very poor passivation ability
of mild steel and their susceptibility to extensive pitting corrosion
in the environment of the contaminated methanol. For anhydrous methanol,
a lower increase in the current density with the increasing potential
is visible from the anode part, in comparison with the cathode part,
for steel in the contaminated methanol. Mild steel could be closer
to a passive state in anhydrous methanol (potential up to 150 mV),
but, despite this, the high susceptibility to corrosion is indicated
by the hysteresis and the data presented in Table 3. The highlighted part of the cathode curve
indicates the achievement of diffusion control of the cathode reaction.

Figure 6 CPP curves
of the mild steel measured in methanol (a) and ethanol (b) with no
contamination and with contamination by a 6 vol % of water and 40
mg/L of sodium chloride.

The mild steel in the ethanol environment shows,
according to Figure 6b, a different behavior in comparison with the methanol; see Figure 6a. The different behavior is associated
with the higher aggressiveness of the methanol, which has a lower
pKa (see Table 1), is easier to deprotonate and it protonates
the water present in the methanol. The mild steel in the anhydrous
ethanol (water content 900 mg/kg), unlike the anhydrous methanol (670
mg/kg), shows no hysteresis at higher current densities. The data
in Table 3 indicate
good passivation kinetics and mild steel resistance in ethanol. The
contamination of the ethanol results in the formation of the hysteresis,
which is not as significant as for methanol. The better repassivation ability of mild steel
in the contaminated ethanol is also obvious from Table 3, where Erp is mostly shifted toward positive values and the entire
reverse polarization shifts slightly toward the lower current densities
than for methanol; see also irp in Table 3.

From the course
of the mild steel CPP in Figure 7a, it is obvious that the contamination of all of the
tested alcohols significantly reduces the difference between Ecorr and Erp, compared
with Figure 4. This
influence of contamination indicates the substantial deterioration
of the repassivation kinetics of the mild steel in the environment
of the contaminated alcohols. From the position of the CPP curves
in Figure 7a, the influence
of the oxygen solubility in the contaminated fuels on the mild steel
resistance can be deduced also. The level of oxygen solubility in
the contaminated ethanol and isopropyl alcohol contributes to the
passivation of the mild steel that results in the shift in the CPP
toward lower current densities; also, see the values of icorr and irp in Table 3. This is probably the initial
state of passivation that was demonstrated for the contaminated ethanol
already in our previous study.10 This state
is unlikely to be persistent and will likely be violated by the influence
of the increasing concentration of the corrosion products in an environment,
which can gradually catalyze the subsequent corrosion development.
For the contaminated methanol, the amount of the dissolved oxygen
is not high enough to allow the repassivation kinetics of the mild
steel to form a sufficiently resistant passive film (high hysteresis
and irp value), although the low icorr values point out to a low corrosion rate.
Conversely, the oxygen solubility is the highest in the contaminated
butanol. Considering the lowest values of pKa for butanol and its lowest aggressiveness from all of the
tested pure alcohols, the oxygen content, at the same contamination
level, plays a substantial role in increasing the butanol aggressiveness
and mild steel corrosion. The hysteresis indication in the anode CPP
part and the shift of the entire curve toward higher current densities
suggests the susceptibility to a pitting corrosion due to the presence
of chlorides and the reduction of the corrosion resistance of the
mild steel in the contaminated butanol.

Figure 7 Influence of the contamination
(6 vol % of water and 40 mg/L of sodium chloride) on the CPP curves
of the mild steel in the alcohols (a) and in the ethanol–gasoline
(b) and isopropyl AGBs (c).

The influence of oxygen solubility on the mild
steel corrosion can also be observed in the contaminated AGBs; see Figure 7b,c. With the increasing
gasoline content in the contaminated EGBs, the oxygen solubility increases
and this also leads to an increase in the blend aggressiveness. Such
an increased aggressiveness is manifested by the shift of the curves
toward higher current densities, as evidenced in Figure 7b, and by the increasing icorr values; see Table 3. The oxygen solubility, dependent on the
gasoline content of the contaminated blend, also has an effect on
the repassivation kinetics of the mild steel. The gasoline content
of 20 vol % significantly deteriorates the repassivation kinetics
and the highest shift of the repassivation CPP part for the E80 blend
indicates the worst corrosion resistance of the mild steel. This low
resistance is also evidenced by the increasing hysteresis in the anode
CPP part. For the contaminated isopropyl AGBs, such hysteresis was not observed
(see Figure 7c), but
despite this, the increasing oxygen content in the blend and the presence
of water with sodium chloride significantly deteriorates the corrosion
resistance of the mild steel as evidenced by the vEIS,corr corrosion rate values in Table 3. With the increasing content of gasoline
to up to 60 vol % in the isopropyl AGBs, the corrosion rate of the
steel significantly increases. The increase in the corrosion rate
is also evident from the CPP shift toward higher current densities
for iP80 and iP60. In addition, the very poor corrosion resistance
of the mild steel in the contaminated iP80 and iP60 blends is indicated
by the overlap of the CPP parts (reverse polarization with the cathode–anode)
in Figure 7 and the
significantly decreasing difference between the Ecorr and Erp values, which
is minimal here.

The influence of organic acids, which may come
from the alcohol production processes or be formed as oxidation products
during the long-term storage of the AGBs, was simulated by the addition
of 80 mg/L of acetic acid. The relevant CPP records are presented
in Figure 8. The addition
of acetic acid increases the activity of the H+ protons
(see the pH and TAN values in Table 4) which, in all of the tested cases, was manifested
by the shift of the Ecorr values to the
positive potential values, which is, in accordance with theory and
previous results, measured in the environments of pure alcohols in
dependence on pKa. In all of the tested
steel-environment systems, the anode current density at the reverse
polarization increases, hysteresis also increases, and the Erp values shift toward more negative values
than the Ecorr values. This indicates
the decreasing corrosion resistance of the mild steel and practically
no passivation abilities with the increasing content of acetic acid.
The results presented in Table 3 point to a two-fold increase in the corrosion rate of the
mild steel in comparison with the contaminated alcohols and their
blends with gasoline without acetic acid.

Figure 8 Influence of acetic acid
(80 mg/L) at the contamination of the B100 (a), B80 (b), E80 (c),
and a E60 (d) fuels. In the figure legend, “a” represents
the contamination with acetic acid.

Gasoline content and the amount of dissolved oxygen
in the contaminated AGBs containing acetic acid significantly affects
the course of depolarization reactions, and an increase in the corrosion
rate of the mild steel occurs. This corrosion rate is increasing with
the gasoline content in the blend as indicated by the calculated corrosion
rates presented in Table 3. According to Figure 9, the shift of the Erp values
toward more negative values becomes more significant and, thus, the
corrosion resistance of the mild steel decreases as well.

Figure 9 Influence of
the gasoline content on the CPP of the mild steel for the contaminated
(6 vol % of water and 40 mg/L of sodium chloride, 80 mg/L of acetic
acid) with ethanol (a) and butanol (b).

Finally, it should be noted that the content of
the water, chlorides, and organic acids has a crucial effect on the
corrosion of mild steel and the corrosion aggressiveness of the alcohols
and their blends with gasoline. This aggressiveness and resistance
are significantly influenced by the physical and chemical properties
of the alcohol and its chain length. Among these physical and chemical
properties, especially, the oxygen solubility and pKa of an alcohol are the most important. For AGBs, the
content of the gasoline in the blend, which affects the oxygen solubility
and the overall aggressiveness of the blend, is the most significant.
It is likely that although gasoline does not promote aggressive corrosion
of mild steel, in many cases, the aggressiveness of the AGBs increases
up to the gasoline content of 40 vol %. This increasing aggressiveness
can be given by the synergistic effect of the dissolved oxygen and
water.9,10 Moreover, it is likely that a further increase
in the gasoline content in the AGBs to values higher than 40 vol %
would result in a decrease in the aggressiveness as the synergic effect
would be impaired due to the decreasing water solubility in the blends;
see the results measured in the environment of the contaminated isopropyl
alcohols–gasoline blends.

3 Conclusions
Using CPP, we have proven
the substantial influence of the alcohol chain length and its physical
and chemical properties (especially pKa, and oxygen and water solubility) on the corrosion aggressiveness
of alcohols and AGBs to mild steel. The oxygen solubility and the
course of the depolarization reactions are also influenced by the
gasoline content. In general, the corrosion resistance and repassivation
ability of the mild steel increase with the increasing alcohol chain
length as a result of the increasing oxygen solubility and increasing
pKa. The effects of the environments of
the pure alcohols for the mild steel are rather of a passivation character.
The very good resistance and passivation ability of mild steel was
especially shown in the pure butanol. When alcohols
and their gasoline blends are contaminated by water, chlorides, and
organic acids, the higher oxygen content, conversely, decreases the
corrosion resistance of the mild steel, and a large increase is observed
in the corrosion rates, even up to 4 orders of magnitude.

The
CPP was found to be a suitable method even for the measurements in
nonaqueous environments of alcohols and their gasoline blends. In
these environments, the CPP gives results having a very good predictive
ability for the corrosion rates of metals, and their ability to be
passivated, or resistant to corrosion, in a given environment.

4 Experimental Section
For the measurement
and the preparation of the AGBs, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol,
and n-butanol were used (all p.a., Penta a.s., the
Czech Republic, with the alcohol content ≥99.9% and water content
≤900 mg/kg). The blends of these alcohols with gasoline were
prepared (AGBs) so that the alcohol content was 40, 60, and 80 vol
%. The alcohols were blended with an in-laboratory-prepared gasoline
with no additives and with a composition in compliance with the EN
228 standard: 57.4 vol % of alkanes, 13.9 vol % of alkenes and 28.7
vol % of aromatics. Isomerate, reformate, light and medium gasoline,
and naphtha from fluidic catalytic cracking, that is, standard gasoline
pool fractions with a sulfur content of ≤1 mg/kg were provided
by Unipetrol a.s., Kralupy nad Vltavou, the Czech Republic. These
alcohols and AGBs were designated as uncontaminated. The contaminated
alcohols and AGBs were prepared from the relevant uncontaminated equivalents
by contamination with water (to 6 vol %), 40 mg/L of sodium chloride
(p.a., 99.9%, Penta a.s., the Czech Republic), and 80 mg/L of acetic
acid (p.a., 99.9%, Penta a.s., the Czech Republic).

The sample
labeling for the uncontaminated fuels consisted of a letter or letters
(M—methanol, E—ethanol, iP—isopropyl alcohol,
B—butanol) and a number describing the alcohol content in the
AGBs. For the contaminated fuels, the labeling consists of the labeling
for the relevant uncontaminated fuel amended by the description of
the contamination. For the fuels contaminated by water and sodium
chloride, this description is as follows: 6 vol % H2O.
For the fuels contaminated by water, sodium chloride and acetic acid,
an “a” has been added before the letter(s) characterizing
the alcohol, for instance: aB80 + 6% H2O.

The electrochemical
measurements were performed on a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat
controlled by the Gamry Framework 5.21. software at an ambient temperature
in a three-electrode arrangement in a cell containing 100 mL of a
tested fuel. The cell was placed in a Faraday cage. The electrode
system consisted of (i) a working electrode from mild steel, cylindrical
in shape with a surface area of 2.4 cm2, (ii) an auxiliary
platinum electrode, and (iii) a reference silver chloride electrode
for the nonaqueous environments with a bridge containing a 0.1 mol/L
solution of lithium chloride in ethanol. The working electrode was
treated by grinding and wet polishing on a 1200 grit abrasive paper
before the measurement, then degreased with acetone (p.a.), and dried
with paper. The cell geometry and the electrode system arrangements
were already presented elsewhere.27

At the beginning of each measurement, the corrosion potential was
measured during its stabilization (OCP) for 1 h. Then, the electrochemical
impedance spectra at an amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range of
1 MHz to 10 mHz were measured. At the end, the CPP was measured with
a scanning rate of 2 mV/s in the range of 1000 mV against the corrosion
potential from the negative to the positive potentials and back again.

The Tafel coefficient for cathode βc and anode
area βa, polarization resistance Rp (Rrp), and corrosion potential Ecorr (Erp) were
obtained by the evaluation of the polarization curve. The corrosion
current density icorr was obtained from
the Stern–Geary equation, eq 2. 2  

The values of the corrosion current
density and the weight losses m in (g/m2·h) of the tested materials for the chosen test period (3600
s) were obtained; see eq 3. 3  A is the proportionality
constant in kg/C, which is designated as the electrochemical equivalent
of the substance; M is the molar mass of steel (55.8
g/mol); z is the number of exchanged electrons; and F is the Faraday constant (9.6485 × 104 C/mol).

The weight loss was then converted using the steel density ρ
(7860 kg/m3) to the corrosion rate vcorr or vrp in mm/year according
to eq 4. 4  

The total acid number (TAN) and pH
values were measured to characterize the aggressiveness of the tested
fuels. The TAN measurements were performed in accordance with the
IP 177/96 and ASTM D664-89 standards on an automatic titrator DMS
TITRINO 716 with a potentiometric detection of an equivalent point.
The pH measurements were performed on an inoLab pH/Cond Level 1 instrument
at an ambient temperature. The obtained TAN and pH results are presented
in Table 4.
