The
synthesis of heterocyclic spirobifluorene (SBF) analogs generally
requires long and complicated synthetic pathways. Despite this synthetic
effort, such structural modification allows the (opto)electronic properties
of this remarkable three-dimensional node to be tuned especially for
molecular electronic applications. For this reason, the development
of a simple, robust, and efficient synthetic methodology to introduce
various heterocycles in place of classical phenyl rings in the spirofluorene
motif is highly and timely desirable. In this context, we describe
herein our efforts to develop a straightforward and efficient synthesis
leading to replacement of 2 phenyl rings by various heterocycles in
spiro compounds from 2,2′-dibromobenzophenone. As the same
procedure to form fully heterocyclic compounds failed, an original
theoretical approach based mainly on the uncommon Fukui dual function
was developed in order to determine clearly the limitation of this
strategy and provide an efficient predictive tool. Indeed, such calculation
allows prediction of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the
synthesis of spiro derivatives using a double aromatic electrophilic
substitution. If this procedure reproduces well our experimental results
focused on (heterocyclic) SBF compounds, it can be certainly adapted
and generalized to other intramolecular substitutions.

Introduction
If many organic molecules
incorporated as materials in organic
electronics can be considered as one-dimensional π-conjugated
systems, the elaboration of two-dimensional and even three-dimensional
(3D) architectures represents a manner to modulate the degree of intra-
and intermolecular interactions in materials.1 Among the numerous examples of 3D structures reported,2 the spirobifluorene (SBF)-based molecules appear
as promising derivatives for organic electronics as they can present
two perpendicular π-conjugated systems exhibiting identical
or complementary properties. On one hand, the multiplication of π-conjugated
systems may allow high mobilities3 and
on the other hand, the presence of bulky groups associated with the
3D node can in contrary favor electroluminescence.4 In the same manner as dye-sensitized solar cell devices,
several examples of SBF-based molecular or polymeric systems have
been recently incorporated in organic solar cells (OSCs).5 In such devices, these systems allow higher photoconversion
efficiencies than their fluorene analogues. Indeed, the spiro node
seems to favor intermolecular interactions in the solid states associated
with facilitated device fabrication because of an enhancement of the
solubility.4b In the organic photovoltaic
field, the replacement of the phenyl moieties by heterocyclic units
could be considered as a general trend to improve the performances
of the corresponding materials.6 Within
this context, the chemical modification of the fluorene core, a promising
arene candidate for OPV due to its rigidity, planarity, and stability
toward photodegradation and thermal oxidation,7 has received considerable attention.8 The first approach consists of the replacement of the sp3 bridging carbon by nitrogen (NR) or silicon (SiR2) and
has led to carbazole9 or silafluorene10 derivatives7,11 as active
materials in OSC. The second trend involves the replacement of phenyl
cycles by thiophene rings thanks to advances in organic synthesis.
This strategy led, for example, to the elaboration of several indacenodithiophene
small molecules12 and polymers presenting
higher performances than the corresponding fluorene derivatives.13

All these results convinced us that incorporating,
in molecular
or polymeric systems designed for optoelectronics, a new generation
of heterocyclic analogues of SBF should be interesting. If the preparation
of thiophenic analogues of SBF is known for years, only few and recent
examples of devices based on these compounds are reported, certainly
because of synthesis issues. In fact, almost all described syntheses
follow the main synthetic strategy used by Clarkson and Gomberg in
1930 to prepare 9,9′-spirobifluorene.14 This one implies in the first step a nucleophilic attack of a bicyclic
compound onto a fluorenone analogue followed in the second step by
an intramolecular cyclization in acidic conditions. This strategy
successively applied by Sinnige,15 Bäuerle,16 and Kobayashi17 appears
complex to optimize in the case of thiophenic derivatives because
of the high reactivity of their terminal positions. Indeed, Bäuerle
indicates that during the final cyclization step, the reaction conducts
to the desired compounds (in low-moderate yields) but also to a mixture
of oligomeric species resulting from intermolecular reactions. By
involving suitable consecutive protected and unprotected steps of
incriminated terminal positions, several compounds have been synthesized
by the teams of Wong18 and Fungo.19 Moreover, the prefunctionalization of terminal
positions may also in some cases partially avoid the unprotected step.20 Nevertheless, in all these cases, the number
of synthetic steps and overall yields may constitute an obstacle to
the development of further devices.

More recently, Chiang et
al. have suggested the second approach
fulfilled for the preparation of disubstituted SBF derivatives21 such as the useful 2,2′-dibromo-9,9′-spirobifluorene.22 In this case, the treatment in acidic conditions
of bis-biphenyl methanone by methane sulfonic acid (MsOH) leads in
one step to the desired compound in good yields because of a double
intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction
(Scheme 1). If the
first synthetic methodology developed by Clarkson and Gomberg was
largely investigated for the preparation of heterocyclic analogues
of SBF, this second one was surprisingly not explored. In this context,
we report in this publication our efforts to prepare bi-heterocyclic
analogues of SBF based on a double intramolecular EAS cyclization
and then to generalize this methodology to tetra-heterocyclic compounds.
For this reason, we have prepared two series of ketones substituted
by bisaromatic systems including one or two heterocyclic motifs and
carried out their acidic treatment with MsOH. If we have successfully
obtained the targeted bi-heterocyclic spiro derivatives in most cases,
our attempts to prepare full thiophenic SBF analogues by this methodology
were ineffective.

Scheme 1 Targeted SBF Derivatives by Double Intramolecular
EAS Cyclization
In order to rationale
these results and to provide a predictive
tool, we conducted an original theoretical study of charges and orbital
interaction factors driving this reaction. In fact, it is commonly
admitted that EAS reactions are in their large majority under frontier
orbital control.23 Indeed, it was one of
the first mechanisms described by Fukui et al. to stress the role
of the frontier orbitals.24 Nevertheless,
in the present case, the involved ketonic species bear two identical
and almost independent conjugated systems. As a consequence, the frontier
molecular orbitals (FMO) may be nearly degenerated and a rationale
based only on FMO interactions could be misleading. Furthermore, charge
interactions could also play a role as cationic reactive species resulting
from the protonation of the ketone. Therefore, the rationale has been
based on the calculated local electrophilicities, nucleophilicities,
and hardness. Such concepts rationalized by Parr and Weitao using
the density functional theory (DFT) can be considered nowadays as
major reactivity indicators.25 In this
study, they are the key points to interpret the experimental observations
and provide a projection on the possibilities of double EAS reaction
concerning the various SBF analog preparations. More importantly,
they represent the fundaments of a prediction tool to fix the limitations
of this synthetic methodology.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
In order
to overview the possibilities to
prepare heterocyclic SBF analogs by a double EAS, we have synthesized
several bis-aryl ketones including a large variety of heterocycles.
In this purpose, the commercially available 2,2′-dibromobenzophenone
allows a straightforward synthesis of targets in one step by Stille
or Suzuki coupling with the corresponding stannylated or boronic ester
heterocycles. Following this procedure, 9 different ketones were prepared
in yields oscillating between 58 and 93% spanning the incorporation
of thiophenes (1s, 3s, 4s),
benzothiophene (2s), furan (1o), benzofuran
(2o), pyrrole (1n), or selenophene (1se) with various substitutions or position isomerisms (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Syntheses of the
Nine Targeted Ketones from 2,2′-Dibromobenzophenone
by Stille or Suzuki Coupling
Pushing further the substitution of phenyl rings by heterocyclic
ones requires in the first place the preparation of the corresponding
heterocyclic analogues of 2,2′-dibromobenzophenone. Amongst
the large number of possibilities, we voluntarily limited our study
to full thiophenic analogs of SBF in reference to the preparation
already described by Fungo (11 steps with an overall yield of 13%).19 In addition, the preparation of di-thiophen-3-yl-methanone
by various procedures is well documented.26 In this context, we targeted bis(2-bromo-5-methylthiophen-3-yl)methanone
(2), as its terminal methyl groups are susceptible to
avoid oligomerization resulting from intermolecular reaction during
cyclization (vide infra). Completed by Stille coupling, the targeted
bis(5,5′-dimethyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-3-yl)methanone (1ss) was easily obtained with an overall yield of 23% in 3
steps from commercial 5-methyl-3-bromothiophene as described in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Preparation of Bis(5,5′-dimethyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-3-yl)methanone
(1ss)
The conversion of the prepared bis-aryl ketone derivatives
into
their corresponding spiro compounds requires strong acidic conditions
first to increase the electrophile character of the central carbon
and second to facilitate the dehydration of the intermediate carbinol.27 For these reasons, we have adapted here the
conditions developed by Chen et al. consisting of treating the corresponding
ketone by methanesulfonic acid.22 We have
used more diluted conditions (C = 1.5 × 10–3 mol·L–1) to limit harmful
intermolecular reactions observed by Bäuerle when heterocycle
terminal positions are unsubstitued.16 In
all cases, this acidic treatment of the methanone derivatives at room
temperature rapidly induces a strong reddish coloration, probably
imputable to the protonation of the ketone. However, the observation
of the intramolecular cyclization leading to the formation of the
corresponding spiro compound was not observed every time (Table 1).

Table 1 Substituent Effect on the Efficiency
of Spiro-Derivative Preparation by Double EAS
As shown in Table 1, the efficiency of the formation of the spiro derivative
is strongly
affected by the nature of the π-conjugated system borne by the
ketone. In agreement with described preparation of 2,2′-dibromospirobifluorene
by Cheng et al.,21b the cyclization of
ketone 1c needs heating of the reaction mixture (Table 1, entry 1). After
12 h at 120 °C, unsubstituted SBF is isolated in 71% yield or
in 57% for the two steps. On the opposite, the insertion of a more
nucleophilic heterocycle than the phenyl ring such as a nude thiophene
(1s, 3s, 4s), pyrrole (1n), or selenophene (1se) allows the obtainment
of the targeted spiro compounds directly at room temperature in good
to moderate yields. Owing to its low stability in acidic media,28 the insertion of a furan unit (1o) conducts only to the full degradation of the ketone. The replacement
of the furan by a benzofuran motif known for its higher stability
remained unsuccessful in the formation of the targeted spiro molecule
as it also led to degradation products.

In order to decrease
the quantity of nonvolatile, toxic, and expensive
methanesulfonic acid, several tests were conducted from 1s. Using a diluted solution of sulfonic acid in chloroform or pentane
still allows the observation of the targeted spiro derivative but
the starting material remains preponderant even after one week. The
opposite approach consisting of increasing compound concentration
is also not satisfactory. It leads in all cases to a clear decrease
of the yield associated with appearance of nonsoluble residues. These
observations can be reasonably assigned to an increase of intermolecular
cross-coupling as already observed in other conditions by Bäuerle
and Mitschke.16 As mentioned above, suitable
functionalization of the terminal position permits to limit side reactions
and improves the spiro preparation efficiency. The first attempt with
benzothiophene (2s) in place of thiophene moieties was
undertaken and led to the desired molecule in 90% yield, the best
registered here.

Moreover, using a methyl group to block the
thiophene terminal
position (3s) confirms this observation from a cheaper
starting material. In this last case, it was possible to use up to
15 more concentrated solutions of 3s and to continue
to obtain the corresponding spiro 3s in moderate good
yield (47% with a concentration of 22 × 10–3 mol·L–1). Thus, in this series, from nine
ketones, if one excludes furan-based derivatives obviously nonstable
in acidic conditions, spiro derivatives were isolated in reasonable
yields when reactions were conducted in diluted conditions or from
heteroaromatic compounds functionalized in their terminal position.

Based on these results, 1ss which bears methyl groups
on all the thiophenic terminal positions appears as an ideal platform
to envision the preparation of a full heterocyclic analogue of SBF
in the same conditions. First, experiments conducted at room temperature
did not allow any reaction, and the starting material was isolated
unchanged, despite observation of a reddish intense solution coloration
assigned to the formation of the cationic intermediate (vide infra).
By analogy with 1c which cyclization requests a higher
temperature, the solution was then heated at 40 °C. At this stage,
a rapid degradation of 1ss was noted without observation
(even in MS) of the spiro target. In order to explain this reactivity
difference between ketonic compounds bearing a phenyl or a thiophenic
ring, several series of analyses were conducted.

X-ray Analyses
The molecular structures of crystals
obtained for 1c, 1s, 2s, 4s, 1se, 1n, 2s, and 1ss have been compared. X-ray structures of 1s and 1ss, both of which crystallize in an orthorhombic C2/c system, are briefly discussed and
presented in Figure 1 (other compounds crystallographic data are provided in Supporting Information). When 1s and 1ss (as others) present encumbered 3D structures,
few intermolecular interactions are observed within the obtained crystals.

Figure 1 X-ray
structures of compounds 1s (left) and 1ss (right).

Concerning intramolecular interactions,
most compounds do not exhibit
short distances between heterocyclic sulfur, oxygen, selenium atoms,
and ketonic Oxygen. At the opposite, strong van der Waals intramolecular
interactions are observed for compound 1ss. Indeed, short
distances (respectively, 2.72 and 2.70 Å) between its ketonic
oxygen and lateral thiophenic sulfur atoms are observed in the solid
state for this compound which does not cyclize under MsOH treatment.

Even if the study of X-ray structures does not indicate the conformational
preference of compounds in solution, the latter can be considered
as an interesting clue to understand reactivity differences. In order
to highlight the similarities and differences between compounds several
criteria were screened. Despite crystallization occurring in the centrosymmetric
group for all compounds, it is important to note that no symmetric
element is recovered in molecules. Thus, with two independent conjugated
systems, the complete X-ray data analysis of each ketone should present
two series of data including interaromatic angles (θ1, θ2), dihedral angles between the carbonyl axis
and grafted aromatic cycles (α1, α2), bond length alternation (BLA) measurements (BLA1, BLA2), and distances between electrophilic and nucleophilic carbons
(d1, d2).
All of these are reported in Table 2.

Table 2 Interaromatic Angles (θ1, θ2), Dihedral Angles between the Carbonyl
Axis and Grafted Aromatic Cycles (α1, α2), Bond Length Alternation, and Distances (in Å) between
Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Carbons (d1, d2) for All Ketone Derivatives Measured
from Their X-ray Structure
Interestingly, one can observe two main differences
between the
ketones undergoing an intramolecular cyclization and 1ss which is not. First, 1ss exhibits the longest distances
between the carbonyl (electrophilic) and thiophenic carbon (nucleophilic)
centers involved in the cyclization (4.54 and 4.56 Å for d1 and d2, respectively).
In fact, these distances are reduced by more than 1 Å for all
other derivatives ranging from 3.15 to 3.25 Å (Table 2). Concerning compound 4s, both 2- and 4-positions of the thiophene (referenced as
C2 and C4, respectively, in Tables 2 and 3) can be considered as
potential reactive locations for the intramolecular cyclization. Despite
shorter distances between the electrophilic center and nucleophilic
carbon C4, only the formation of spiro-4s resulting from
the double cyclization in C2 positions is observed which can be reasonably
explained by the well-known higher reactivity of the latter positions
upon EAS reaction.29

Dihedral Angles between the Carbonyl
Axis and Grafted Aromatic Cycles (α1, α2), Bond Length Alternation, and Distances (in Å) between
Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Carbons (d1, d2) for All Protonated Ketones Measured
from the Corresponding Optimized Structure
Second, all ketones undergoing an intramolecular cyclization
in
acidic media to form the corresponding spiro derivative present a
high dihedral angle (ranging from 38.7 to 80.4°) between vicinal
heterocycles. In fact, only 1ss exhibits two low angle
values with 28.7° and 28.1° (Table 2). As a consequence, the less encumbered
bithiophenic motif should conduct to an extension of the conjugation
over both cycles. This observation is assessed by the measurement
of BLA which is defined as the average of the difference in length
between adjacent carbon–carbon bonds in a polyene chain. In
this purpose, Table 2 gathers the BLA of the two considered conjugated skeletons on both
sides of the carbonyl electrophilic motif (represented in red and
blue) for all ketone derivatives. It is worth to note that, as expected,
a lower BLA, that is, a better conjugation between the electron-rich
and -deficient parts of the molecule is observed for 1ss. However, solid-state structures of ketones cannot prefigure the
behavior of their corresponding protonated forms in high polar and
protic solution. These observations allow us to only presume that
the electron densities of nucleophilic and electrophilic centers associated
to their distance separation are the two main parameters which drive
here the reactivity. In this context, if one excludes furan-based
ketones (1o and 2o) nonstable in acidic
conditions, the lack of reactivity of 1ss may be due
to conjugation of high distance and predictable lower electron density
on the nucleophilic centers due to a higher conjugation with the carbonyl
motif.

Calculations
To stress such hypothesis, theoretical
calculations have been carried out. As experimental evidences demonstrate
the formation of a colorful cationic intermediate in all cases, the
calculations were launched on the cationic form of the protonated
ketone which can be considered as the reactive species. A conceptual
DFT approach has been chosen (see Computational
Details) as it offers interesting and efficient tools for this
reactivity problem. The first computational step implies geometric
optimizations starting from the X-ray diffraction positions of the
ketone manually protonated.

Starting from optimized geometries,
interaromatic angles (θ1, θ2), dihedral
angles between the carbonyl axis and grafted aromatic cycles (α1, α2), BLA and distances between electrophilic
and nucleophilic carbons (d1, d2) were determined for each derivative and gathered
in Table 3. As we can
see, calculated data collected on Table 3 for the protonated species are coherent
with those measured on the corresponding ketone crystals (Table 2). It results that
protonation and charge do not affect much the geometry, and similar
trends are observed. A longer distance between electrophilic and nucleophilic
centers is still observed for the protonated 1ss (4.21
Å) in comparison with other compounds where it oscillates between
3.17 and 3.24 Å. Moreover, the calculated smaller interaromatic
angle (θ1 or θ2) for 1ss only attains 26.5° in contrast with others all of which present
angles higher than 41.2°. This latter observation is in accordance
with the lower BLA registered for 1ss and indicates a
global higher conjugation between electro- and nucleophilic parts
of the molecule and then a probable lower reactivity. However, the
difference of reactivity and the necessity to heat the reaction mixture
in some cases could not be rationalized only by these conformational
variations.

As EASs are usually under frontier orbital control,30 we looked at the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) topology for the nucleophilic sites and at the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) topology for the electrophilic
ones. The FMO plots are represented in Figure 2 for the 1c and 1ss cationic compounds (all other FMO plots are provided in Supporting Information). It is worth noting that
the HOMO in all cases is essentially centered only on one of the two
conjugated systems grafted on the ketone motif. It is a consequence
of the asymmetry between the two arms because of the protonation of
the carbonyl function. In addition, it can be noted that the HOMO
of all compounds exhibits reasonable coefficients on the expected
nucleophilic carbons. Nevertheless, they are not large and different
enough to explain the reactivity differences. Concerning the HOMO
– 1, they are the mirror images of the HOMO but centered on
the other arm. Their energies are usually at least 0.3 eV below the
corresponding HOMO levels, excepted for 4s where the
two levels are only separated by 0.06 eV. At the opposite, a stronger
difference in energy (at least 2 eV) separates the LUMO and LUMO +
1 levels for all compounds.

Figure 2 FMO plots (cutoff value was set to 20%) for
the cations of 1c above and 1ss below.

Located on the carbon of the protonated
carbonyl, main LUMO level
contributions allow identification of the electrophilic center involved
in EAS cyclization. All compounds present high LUMO coefficients on
this part of their skeleton.

In order to rationale the reactivity
of charged species (considered
as hard reactants) involved in a reaction pathway, the electrostatic
potential has generally to be investigated.32 Requiring important calculation resources,32b the calculated molecular electrostatic potential maps on our protonated
ketones do not provide satisfactory results. First, their encumbered
and folded 3D structures do not facilitate the clear visualization
of the electrostatic potential variation along the different sites.
Second, the different protonated ketones see their positive charge
delocalized on the whole molecule. The present intramolecular cyclization
process involving two sites bearing a delocalized positive charge,
the molecular electrostatic potential maps are then essentially positive.
It only confirms the strong electrophilicity of the protonated carbonyl
carbon (vide infra). Nevertheless, they are not large and different
enough to explain the reactivity differences. In this context, even
if they are not expected to perform well in the case of charge-controlled
reactions,33 the Fukui functions were calculated
to identify the different nucleophilic sites.

These functions
are defined as the electron density differences
(ρ) between the same molecule when one electron is gained (N + 1 electrons) or when an electron is lost (N – 1 electrons), without geometry modifications. As a consequence,
two Fukui functions can be defined. First, the electrophilic Fukui
function, f+, resulting from the addition
of an electron [ρ(N + 1) – ρ(N)], shows the regions where electrophilicity is important.
Therefore, if f+ is similar to the square
of the LUMO, the contribution of other orbitals and the electronic
reorganization are negligible. Symmetrically, the nucleophilic Fukui
function, f–, is obtained by the
electron density difference [ρ(N) –
ρ(N – 1)] and should be compared to
the square of the HOMO. The Fukui function plots are represented in Figure 3 for the 1c and 1ss cationic compounds (see Supporting Information for all other protonated ketones).
A clear likeness is observed for all compounds between the square
of the FMOs and the Fukui functions, even for 4s which
presents an almost degenerated HOMO. One critical detail emerges from
the FMO and Fukui function scrupulous observation. In fact, some carbon
positions involved in the cyclization appear in both f– and f+ representations,
especially in the case of 1ss. It induces that a same
position could present both an electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivity.
As a consequence, the dual descriptor (fd = f+ – f–) introduced by Morell et al.34 seems to be a more convenient tool to apprehend an intramolecular
reactivity problem as in our case. As this latter is based on both
Fukui functions, it allows direct assessment of the local main reactivity
in one picture.34 The dual descriptors
for compounds 1c and 1ss are plotted in Figure 3. The solid blue
surfaces highlight the electrophilic sites, as the white hollow surfaces
represent the nucleophilic ones. In this representation, the electrophilicity
of the protonated ketone carbon is well confirmed for both compounds.
At the opposite, a strong differentiation concerning the nucleophilic
centers between 1ss and other protonated ketones is clearly
highlighted. In the case of ketones undergoing intramolecular cyclization,
the involved aromatic positions exhibit a large positive contribution
in dual descriptors as demonstrated by the large white hollow on the
ortho position in the case of 1c (Figure 3). Concerning 1ss, the fd plot reveals that the C3 thiophenic carbons
potentially involved to form the corresponding spiro motif present
almost negligible contributions. As a consequence, these positions
are neither electrophilic nor nucleophilic, and then just inactive
for intramolecular EAS reaction.

Figure 3 Representation of the electrophilic (f+) and nucleophilic (f–) Fukui
function plots (cutoff value: 25%) for the cations of 1c and 1ss where the white hollow surfaces (negative Fukui
functions) are due to the orbital relaxation but are not in this case
qualitatively important31 and the corresponding
dual descriptor (f+–f–) plots (cutoff value: 25%) where the blue and
white surfaces represent, respectively, the electrophilic and nucleophilic
sites.

To prevent an abusive conclusion
drawn on a picture depending on
cutoff values, the condensed dual descriptor values associated with
each atom were obtained through the Hirshfeld charge difference method
(see Computational Details). Starting from
this, the general reactivity indicator proposed by Anderson et al.
can be used as it can describe both the charge and frontier orbital
control of the chemical reactions.35 Nonetheless,
this latter depends on the quantity of transferred electrons between
the nucleophile and the electrophile. In the case of an intramolecular
reaction, this quantity is ill-defined. Hence, we focused on the main
term relating the orbital interaction, described and named by Berkowitz,
the coulomb integral between Fukui functions.36 As a consequence, this integral was adapted to the condensed forms
of the dual descriptor. The sum (Cdual) of all the interactions between the different nucleophile carbons
with the electrophile ones were thus considered, and the calculated
values are reported in Table 4 for all ketone derivatives. As the dual descriptor values
are negative for electrophile sites and positive for nucleophile ones,
the product is expected to be negative. As a consequence, a large
negative value denotes a favorable thermodynamic stabilization. Owing
to the less active nucleophilic sites, the 1ss compound
presents an overall sum (−0.3) up to ten times weaker than
the other compounds what clearly rationalizes its noncyclization.

As the Fukui functions and the FMO control,
the dual descriptor
is mainly associated to the thermodynamic control. The dual descriptor
cannot, then, fully reflect the changes observed in the yields of
spiro compound formation. Obviously, the reaction yield results from
multiple steps of synthesis and the purification process and cannot
be precisely predicted with just a rationale based on the reactants.
A full prediction of the whole mechanism is then out of the scope
of this article. In order to get some clues on the observed yield
differences and required thermal activation for spiro-derivative preparation,
the interactions between the charges have been studied to include
long-range effects37 (see Table 1). Indeed, the protonation of
the ketone seems to conduct to a strong enhancement of its electrophile
character; however, on the other hand, the generated charge will be
delocalized on the conjugated arm and could lead to calculated small
positive charges on the expected nucleophile heteroaromatic positions
reducing their reactivity. In the most favorable cases, they will
induce a suitable orientation of the system and then promote the first
intramolecular EAS reaction. On the contrary, a thermal activation
of the reaction mixture will be required to overcome an additional
reaction barrier induced by unfavorable small repulsion resulting
from charge interactions. Because the molecular electrostatic potential
maps are not clear, we have transposed the formula used to determine Cdual to the atomic charges of the protonated
ketones in order to reflect the charge interactions.

Therefore,
these pseudo-Coulomb interaction values, Ccharge, were calculated for all protonated ketones and
reported in Table 4 revealing a rationale. Indeed, as for Cdual, a large Ccharge negative value indicates
a favorable interaction. Therefore, calculations conclude to an overall
unfavorable charge repartition in some cases translated by a positive
value of Ccharge such as compound 1c.

Effectively, the 1c system has to overcome
an important
electrostatic repulsion (Ccharge = +2.5)
to undergo the cyclization process largely thermodynamically favored
(Cdual = −5.7). Starting from this,
the formation of spiro-1c only at high temperature is
well explained by both antagonist effects. At the light of these results,
the poor yield observed for spiro-1se can be reasonably
rationalized by an unfavorable kinetic competition between the cyclization
process and possible side reactions such as intermolecular cross-coupling.
In this context, a thorough optimization of the thermal and dilution
conditions could permit to improve the efficiency of this thermodynamically
feasible reaction (Cdual = −2.9).
At the opposite, the obtainment following this methodology of the
corresponding spiro derivative starting from 1ss seems
compromised regarding disadvantageous charges and orbital interaction
indicators.

Conclusions
We have prepared six
new biheterocyclic SBF analogues following
a simple synthesis methodology based on a double EAS reaction in only
two steps with a global yield ranging from 20 to 70%. According to
experimental observations, this synthetic pathway permits large structural
modifications of classical SBF in order to tune its electronic properties
with the substitution of two phenyl rings by various heterocycles.
Despite our efforts, this synthesis approach remains not applicable
to the preparation of the full thiophenic SBF.

In order to rationalize
our results, we have set up a conceptual
DFT approach. By performing geometric optimizations of the protonated
ketones followed by the calculation of the Fukui dual descriptors,
we have identified two key parameters allowing predicting their reactivity
toward EAS reaction: the dual descriptors (Cdual) and the atomic charges (Ccharge). The determination of these reactivity indicators allows evaluating
the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the involved intramolecular
EAS reaction. In this context, the required thermal activation, yield
decrease, and reaction inefficiency experimentally observed are well
correlated. To conclude, the original theoretical approach developed
in this study can obviously serve as an efficient predictive tool
for those who are interested in the design and the preparation of
new spiro nodes by double intramolecular EAS. More generally, it could
also pave the way to the development of a rationale concerning other
intramolecular chemical processes where the classical frontier orbital
approach does not fulfill researcher expectation.

Materials and
Methods
Commercially available (Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, and
abcr) chemicals
were used as received. The catalyst Pd(PPh3)4 was synthesized according to a literature reference and stored under
an argon atmosphere in the fridge.38 Diethylether
(Et2O) was freshly distilled from sodium each time prior
to the reaction. Solvents (1,2-dimethoxyethane/water, 4:1) employed
in Suzuki couplings were always degassed with argon prior to utilization.
Organolithium reagent nBuLi (1.6 M in hexanes) was
purchased from ACROS (AcroSeal) and was regularly standardized using
diphenylacetic acid. For flash chromatography, silica gel (Fluka,
60 Å pore size, 230–400 Å mesh) was used for all
described compounds. NMR analysis was carried out using Bruker AVANCE
300 and Bruker AVANCE II 400 spectrometers in CDCl3 at
25 °C. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the solvent
(CDCl3) residual value: δ = 7.26 for 1H NMR and δ = 77.16 for 13C NMR. Coupling constants
are reported in hertz and rounded to the nearest 0.1 Hz. Mass spectra
were acquired on a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer AccuTOF
GCv by JEOL using an FD emitter (10 kV). Infrared spectra were recorded
using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer. Melting points were
determined using Büchi melting point apparatus B-540. Cyclic
voltammetry was performed in a three-electrode cell equipped with
a platinum millielectrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a
silver wire used as a quasi-reference electrode. The voltammograms
were recorded on a potentiostat/galvanostat (BioLogic-SP150) driven
by EC-Lab software with positive feedback compensation. Based on repetitive
measurements, absolute errors on potentials were estimated to be ≈±5
mV. All the potentials reported were calibrated versus ferrocene/ferrocenium
oxidation potential (+0.405 V vs SCE or +0.425 V vs Ag/AgCl).

Synthesis Procedures
General
Procedure for the Stille Coupling of 2,2′-Dibromobenzophenone
A mixture of 2,2′-dibromobenzophenone, an organotin compound
(2.5 equiv), and Pd(PPh3)4 is dissolved in toluene.

Computational
Details
All calculations have been performed
with the Gaussian 09 program.40 For all
molecules, the gas-phase ground-state geometries have been optimized,
without forcing any symmetry, by a DFT method with the hybrid PBE0
functional (with 25% of exact exchange)41 and the augmented and polarized Pople double zeta basis set 6-31+G(2d,2p).
All ground-state geometries have been verified by frequency calculation
showing that the stationary point corresponds to a global minimum
on the potential energy surface. To determine the Fukui functions
and dual descriptors, the electron densities have been calculated
with (N + 1) and (N – 1)
electrons, without changing the geometry (single-point calculations).
The condensed Fukui and dual descriptor values were obtained through
the Hirshfeld charge difference method (Yang–Mortier scheme).42 The Hirshfeld population analysis used takes
into account the interatomic electrostatic interactions (named HirshfeldEE
in Gaussian).43 Molecular orbitals (MOs),
Fukui functions, and dual descriptor (f+, f–, fdual) pictures have been generated by a homemade automated program interfaced
with Pov–Ray.44 Cutoff values have
been automatically set to correspond to an integration of 20% for
MO, f+ and f–, and 25% for fdual.
