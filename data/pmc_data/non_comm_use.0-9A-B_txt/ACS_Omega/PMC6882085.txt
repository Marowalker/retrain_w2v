Highly transparent
optical surfaces with antireflection (AR) properties
have the potential to increase the performance of a wide range of
applications, such as windows for photovoltaic cells, photodetectors,
and display screens among others. Biomimetic structures inspired by
the moth-eye have attracted much attention as they can offer superior
AR properties, which can generate broadband, omnidirectional optical
transmission, and water-repellent self-cleaning behavior. However,
many biomimetic surfaces suffer from time-consuming and complex processing,
for example, electron beam and nanoimprint lithography, and/or sub-optimal
mechanical reliability. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid material
approach—nanostructured polyimide on a substrate—for
demonstrating a surface with significant AR and hydrophobic properties
together with low scattering (haze) and high mechanical resistance.
As an example of applications, we demonstrate an indium tin oxide
transparent conductive substrate with a large AR effect and optical
transmission associated to the nanostructured polyimide coating. The
proposed design and method based on conventional spin-coating and
lithography-free metal dewetting have the potential to be a low-cost
processing path of nanostructured AR transparent substrates.

Introduction
Optical surfaces made
of transparent materials such as glass, quartz,
dielectric crystals, and organic polymers suffer from high reflectivity,
which negatively impacts the performances of the optical and optoelectronic
devices such as lenses, displays, photodetectors, sensors, and solar
cells among many others. For example, in the case of glass, a widely
used material for optical devices, the reflectivity is typically 4%
under normal angle of incidence (AOI) which becomes even larger at
higher AOI. Therefore, there have been intensive efforts toward the
development of antireflection (AR) technologies over the past decades,
for both organic and inorganic substrates including opaque substrates
such as silicon wafers. Conventional and commercially available technologies
are based on AR coatings, among which the most common approach is
based on multilayer coatings. By controlling the thickness and the
refractive indices of the layered materials, destructive interference
and negligible reflections can be achieved.1−10 However, simultaneously achieving broadband performance in both
wavelength and AOI is challenging with AR multilayers. For large AOI,
reflections become significant for a structure designed to work properly
at AOI close to 0°.

One alternative is to use subwavelength
nanostructured surfaces.
In nature, such surfaces are found in the eyes of many nocturnal insects.11−17 For example, in the case of moths, the surface of each cornea is
a hexagonal array of cuticular nanostructures with a conical shape.
The subwavelength dimensions ensure little, if any, scattering (haze)
while offering a gradual change of the effective refractive index.
This leads to the broadband and omnidirectional AR property.18−22 Similar structures can be encountered on lotus leaves which provide
superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning property.23−28 Unfortunately, many of the proposed technical solutions to produce
nanostructured AR surfaces involve time-consuming and expensive lithography
(e.g., electron beam and nanoimprint), and often, the mechanical durability
of the nanostructures against abrasion test is not sufficient, and
in many instances, it is not even reported.29−35

Recently, we reported a method of creating the AR glass substrate
through nanoholes.28 The process entails
deposition of polystyrene nanobeads followed by reducing its size
by oxygen plasma etching. After deposition of the copper film, reactive
ion etching replicate structures in the glass and, finally, the copper
mask is removed. Both broadband AR property and mechanical durability
have been demonstrated on the glass substrates with nanoholes. In
the present paper, we introduce a hybrid material approach, nanostructured
polyimide (PI) on the glass substrate as an alternative process that
is easier to fabricate. The new approach obviates the need for the
glass etching step, while maintaining similar AR and durability properties
of the substrate as in the previous work. PI is chosen for its high
transparency in the visible wavelength region and high chemical and
mechanical resistance.36−38 In order to nanostructure the PI film, we use metal
dewetting, that is, the formation of high surface density nanoparticles
from an ultrathin metal film that undergoes a rapid thermal annealing
(RTA). Metal dewetting for nanostructuring the surface of glass substrates
had already been used by us;19,39,40 however, to our knowledge, it is the first time that is exploited
to nanopattern films of polymers, such as PI. Such technique has the
advantage of being simple and scalable as it does not rely on time-consuming
and sophisticated lithography (e.g., electron beam and nanoimprint).
Nanoimprint technology is often used to create polymer nanostructures
on a receiving substrate via molding of an initially deposited film
using a proper mask.29,31 On the contrary, in our work,
we first define the Cu nanomask on the substrate and then deposit
the polymeric PI film. Finally, the nanostructure is created by simple
etching of the Cu nanomask. We have demonstrated the versatility of
the current method by creating a nanohole PI film onto glass and indium
tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, which leads to a combined
effect of high transparency, low reflectivity, high conductivity,
making it a suitable candidate for applications such as transparent
heaters. Additionally, we have also developed a numerical model of
the optical properties of the hybrid substrate, which enables optimal
design.

Methods
Nanohole Patterning of the PI Film on the
Glass Substrate
In the last few years, patterning techniques
such as nanoimprint
lithography (NIL) or microcontact printing (μ-CP) have been
investigated for nanostructuring a wide range of polymers. Attempts
to nanostructure a thin layer of PI on different substrates have also
been reported. Nanostructuring via NIL showed good resolution and
throughput. In spite of this, NIL suffers from several shortcomings.
If the PI curing is performed during the molding step, lower processing
temperatures can be used, but solvent degassing might occur, creating
bubbles and damaging the structures. In addition, the demolding step
can also distort the shape. If, instead, the NIL template is employed
on an already cured PI film, temperatures above glass transition are
needed. These typically range from 300 to 500 °C, which could
be too high for many materials forming devices. Etching the PI layer
using a previously NIL-nanostructured photoresist as a mask can also
be considered. Nevertheless, this method is not preferred, as it usually
needs additional etching steps or intermediate silica layers between
the PI film and the photoresist. In our work, we use the metal dewetting
technique to form the initial nanopatterning as it is explained in
the following of this section.

The nanostructured PI on glass
substrate fabrication steps are shown in Figure 1. Double-side, optically polished, ultraviolet-grade
fused silica (FS) glass substrates, with a thickness of 1 mm and an
area of 1 inch square, were used. Initially, their surface was cleaned
in acetone followed by ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min each.
The substrates were then rinsed in deionized water and dried with
nitrogen followed by oxygen plasma cleaning for 10 min (PVA TePla
300 SemiAuto Plasma Asher). Ultrathin copper (Cu) films with a thickness
of 15 nm were deposited on the flat glass surface using a magnetron
sputtering system (ATC Orion 8, AJA International, Inc.), as shown
in Figure 1a. The depositions
were performed at a base pressure of 10–8 Torr,
room temperature, 100 W of DC-power, and 25 standard cubic centimeters
per minute of pure argon (Ar). The working pressure was 1.5 ×
10–3 Torr, the deposition rate was 0.166 nm/s, and
the target–substrate distance was 40 cm. In order to create
nanoparticles, the samples were subjected to RTA, as shown in Figure 1b. Dewetting takes
place because the surface energy of the ultrathin metal film is greater
than the interfacial and surface energy of the underlying substrate.
Before RTA, all of the samples were blown with a N2 gun
to ensure that the surface was completely clear of small dust particles
and pollutants that could alter the dewetting process. The RTA was
carried out in the TsunamiTM RTP-600S system at the temperature of
750 °C for 135 s. High-purity N2 gas (1 atm pressure)
was used to prevent oxidation of the metal film. After RTA, diluted
polyimide (CP1 polyimide, NeXolve Materials) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was spin-coated over the whole sample,
but only partially the metal dewetted nanoparticles. An APS [(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane]
promoter was used to improve the adhesion of the PI layer to the glass
substrate.41 By modifying the concentration
of PI in the NMP solution and some of the parameters of the spin coater
(G3P Spin Coater, specialty coating systems), it is possible to control
the thickness of the deposited film. Optimal results were achieved
with a ratio of 1:3 of PI on NMP, with parameters of 6000 rpm and
90 s for the spin-coating process. The curing process is critical
to determine the final PI properties. A two-step curing was performed.
First, the samples were cured at 100 °C for 3 min and subsequently
at 200 °C for 15 min. Both steps were carried out on a hot plate
(Cimarec digital hot plate stirrer, Thermo Scientific). After the
curing process, by using ammonium persulfate, it is possible to chemically
etch the Cu nanoparticles, leaving a nanohole PI film structure on
the surface.

PI (c). Finally, the Cu particles are removed by chemical etching
leading to a PI nanohole array (d). SEM (left) and AFM (right) images

Optical, Morphological, Durability, and Wetting Characterization
The optical transmission and reflection were measured in the wavelength
range of 380–800 nm by using a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(PerkingElmer LAMBDA 950). Reflection measurements at normal incidence
in Figures 2 and 3 are carried out with an AOI of 6°. Haze measurements
were performed using Haze-meter (BYK-Gardner 4601 haze-gloss). Ten
measurements per sample were carried out to obtain the average value
and the standard deviation. The morphology of the samples was examined
by a scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM, Inspect F, FEI Systems)
working from 2 to 5 kV accelerating voltage at 10 mm distance. Additional
surface analysis was performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM)
(VEECO Dimension 3100, Bruker). The PI thickness was measured using
a profilometer (KLA Tencor). The durability test was done by a crockmeter
machine (M238BB Electronic Crockmeter, SDL ATLAS). The crockmeter
test provides reproducible and comparable results emulating the action
of a human finger using standard rubbing materials (microfiber cloth).
It uses a constant force (9 N) over 2 cm2 and is repeated
for specific number of cycles. It is a standard test standardized
by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC)
as test method 8. The wetting properties of the samples were determined
by measuring the static and dynamic water contact angle by using a
drop shape analysis system (DSA-100, Krüss GmbH). Different
areas of each sample were examined and averaged.

of light rays through the nanostructured PI. The antireflective effect
comes from the destructive interference created by the film, approximating
a quarter-wave layer.

(NS PI) on the ITO-coated glass structure (a). Corresponding optical

and ITO-coated glass substrates are also shown for comparison (b).

Modeling of Optical Response
Finite
element method
commercial software (COMSOL Multiphysics) was used to perform electromagnetic
simulations. The nanostructured PI on glass was simulated using periodic
boundary conditions and modeled as a square cell with a centered cavity.
Parametric sweep to optimize the structure was performed using dimensional
analysis from SEM and profilometer measurements (Supporting Information, Figure 2a). Refractive index and absorption
coefficients of PI (Supporting Information, Figure S2b1) were calculated from the best fit of experimental
transmission and reflection results of the flat (continuous) PI film
on the FS substrate. The FS refractive index plotted in Supporting Information, Figure S2b2, is taken
from the Filmetrics.com refractive index database.

Results and Discussion
The new method to fabricate subwavelength nanostructures in PI
films is shown in Figure 1 and described in detail in the Methods section. The initial ultrathin Cu film deposited by sputtering (Figure 1 a) determines the
size, height, and density of the Cu nanoparticles (nanoholes in the
final PI film) formed after the dewetting process represented in Figure 1 b. The thicker the
initial Cu film, the larger the size of nanoholes and lower their
surface density in the final nanostructured PI film. We performed
simulations that confirmed that deviations in nanohole size and density
with respect to those of the nanostructured PI on the glass sample
of Figure 2 lead to
a lower AR effect and transmission for the PI thickness used in the
paper. The thickness of the PI and the height of the metal nanoparticles
are key factors to create the nanostructure successfully. If the metal
nanoparticles are too short or the PI film is too thick, the former
remains embedded in the latter and cannot be removed by etching (see Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Figure 2 shows the
total transmission and reflection as a function of wavelength for
bare glass, continuous PI, and nanostructured PI on glass. All the
samples had the same PI thickness (60 nm) determined from profilometry.
Because of the refractive index and absorption coefficient of PI,
the addition of a continuous film reduced transmission and increased
reflection of the coated FS substrate. After nanohole formation in
the PI film, AR effects are clearly visible (Figure 2b), with transmission becoming larger than
the initial FS substrate (Figure 2a). The incident light is reflected from both the top
surface of the nanostructured PI film and interface between the nanostructured
PI film and substrate. The reflected light beams interfere, and when
the thickness of the PI film gets close to a quarter of the wavelength,
the interference becomes destructive, thus minimizing the reflection
(inset of Figure 2b).
The PI film has subwavelength nanostructures (nanoholes); this leading
to an effective refractive index given by the volume ratio between
air/PI. The effective refractive index determines the thickness that
corresponds to the quarter-wave layer condition. Despite the fact
that the quarter-wave layer condition is not completely achieved because
of the lithographic limit of the PI thickness, our results are comparable
with other polymer-based AR solutions42−44 or nanostructured films
on polymeric substrates45 but without the
need for using molding or lithography processes. In the future, full
optimization should improve current performance even further.

In Figure 2, we
also show results from full-wave electromagnetic simulations using
a commercial finite element package (COMSOL Multiphysics Modeling
Software). The refractive index and absorption coefficient for PI
for the simulation are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S2, and are obtained through the best fit of the experimental
response of the continuous (flat) PI on the FS substrate. The average
period (200 nm), diameter (135 nm), and angle (30°) of the nanohole
PI structure were extracted from a statistical analysis of SEM images.
There is a good agreement between experiment and simulation, which
is essential for design optimization. We also simulated
the angular dependence of the AR response of the nanostructured PI
film on the FS substrate and on ITO on the FS substrate (Supporting Information, Figure S3), confirming
that one-side reflection remains below 7 and 16%, respectively, up
to an AOI of 60°.

A crucial parameter for optical surfaces
is light scattering, usually
quantified through the haze factor. In many applications, haze must
maintain a low value. For example, the haze value is preferred to
be less than 1% in display applications. The average haze value and
standard deviation for our nanostructured PI on FS were 0.07 and 0.02%,
respectively, very close to the detection limit of the instrument.
This confirms that reflected and transmitted light are essentially
direct, with very little scattering. The decrease in transmission
at shorter wavelength is likely due to absorption in the PI layer.

The proposed hybrid-material surface nanostructuring process is
versatile and could be applied to a large variety of substrate materials
for different applications. As a prototypical example, we show its
use for the ITO-coated glass (FS) substrate. ITO-based transparent
conductive surfaces are the key in many optoelectronic devices, where
electrical signals need to be generated or collected with high optical
transmission, for example, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, smart
windows, and liquid crystal displays. The nanostructuring of the PI
film was carried out in the same way as it was described in the Methods section for the glass (FS) substrate. The
ITO thickness was 100 nm. As it is shown in Figure 3, the AR effects are significant, leading
to a strongly reduced reflection over almost the entire visible wavelength
range, and correspondingly, a transmission larger than the initial
ITO on the glass substrate. At the same time, the entire process essentially
maintains the electrical conductivity of the ITO layer (lower than
20 Ω/sq).

Next, we investigated the mechanical durability
of the nanostructured
substrate. Figure 4 shows the effect of the crockmeter test on the proposed hybrid PI
glass nanostructured surface. As it can be seen from comparing SEM
images and the optical characterization before and after more than
500 crock-meter passes, the PI nanostructure remains practically unchanged.
The proven surface durability is because of the well-known PI mechanical
strength as well as the fact that the bonding force between the PI
film and FS substrate was increased by using an adhesion promoter
(3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES). The mechanical resistance
test indicates a strong adhesion between the nanostructured PI film
and the underneath substrate, especially considering the fact that
nanostructuring reduces the surface available for the adhesion of
the PI to the substrate and may also weaken the cohesive strength
of the film. In the case of the nanostructured PI on the ITO-coated
glass substrate, the PI also acts as a protective layer for the ITO,
maintaining its electrical conductivity. Besides being strong, the
PI film is mechanically flexible. Therefore, the proposed nanostructured
PI film can be easily applied to flexible substrates, such as ultrathin
glass.46

PI on the glass (FS) substrate (sample similar to that of Figure 2). Comparison between
before (a) and after (b) more than 500 passes performed with standard
9 N force over 2 cm2 contact area using the standard microfiber
crockmeter cloth. Optical comparison of bare FS and nanostructured
PI on the FS substrate before and after the crockmeter test (c).

The wetting property on the nanohole surface could
be described
by the well-known Cassie–Baxter equation 1  where θ is the contact angle of the
composite state, f is the area fraction of the holes,
θ1 and θ2 are the Young contact
angles on the hole and solid areas. As it is shown in Figure 5, the bare glass (FS) coated
with continuous (flat) PI shows a water contact angle of about θ2 = 95°. After nanostructuring the PI film, the underlying
substrate could be clean glass for which the Young contact angle could
be very low. In the limiting case of ultraclean glass, θ1 = 0°, the contact angle of the composite state according
to eq 1 is θ ≈
74° approximately, corresponding to f =
0.33. This is the reason behind reduction of the contact angle after
nanoholes are formed. However, after the flurosilanization step, the
Young contact angle of the glass is θ1 = 120°.
There is uncertainty with respect to where the droplet meniscus resides
in this configuration. However, the contact angle for the two limiting
cases could be calculated: (1) meniscus fully wets the holes and (2)
meniscus is suspended on the hole. The contact angles for these two
limiting cases according to eq 1 are approximately 103 and 113°. We note that larger
contact angles are required to achieve superhydrophobicity and eventually
self-cleaning properties. In the future, this may be possible by increasing
the void fraction of the current nanohole structure and the chemical
affinity between the fluorosilane coating and the PI material.47

glass (FS)
substrate with flat PI, nanostructured PI, and nanostructured PI coated

Conclusions
We
have proposed a hybrid material-nanostructured optical surface,
namely, a PI film with nanohole geometry, which possess significant
AR properties, together with low scattering, high transparency, and
mechanical durability. It can be fabricated using inexpensive, lithography-free,
and scalable metal dewetting techniques. The combination of all these
features make the newly developed optical surface relevant for a wide
range of applications such as windows for photovoltaic cells, photodetectors,
display screens, and optical components for remote sensing. As an
example, which could be utilized to fabricate transparent heaters,
we have demonstrated that the optical performance of a commercially
available transparent and conductive ITO-coated glass substrate can
be effectively improved without affecting the electrical properties
by applying the proposed nanostructured PI film.
