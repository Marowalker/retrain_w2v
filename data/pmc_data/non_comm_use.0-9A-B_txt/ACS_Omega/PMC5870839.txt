The
most common biotransformation of trivalent inorganic arsenic
(As(III)) is methylation to mono-, di-, and trimethylated species.
Methylation is catalyzed by As(III) S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) methyltransferase (termed ArsM in microbes and AS3MT in animals).
Methylarsenite (MAs(III)) is both the product of the first methylation
step and the substrate of the second methylation step. When the rate
of the overall methylation reaction was determined with As(III) as
the substrate, the first methylation step was rapid, whereas the second
methylation step was slow. In contrast, when MAs(III) was used as
the substrate, the rate of methylation was as fast as the first methylation
step when As(III) was used as the substrate. These results indicate
that there is a slow conformational change between the first and second
methylation steps. The structure of CmArsM from the thermophilic alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae sp. 5508 was determined with
bound MAs(III) at 2.27 Å resolution. The methyl group is facing
the solvent, as would be expected when MAs(III) is bound as the substrate
rather than facing the SAM-binding site, as would be expected for
MAs(III) as a product. We propose that the rate-limiting step in arsenic
methylation is slow reorientation of the methyl group from the SAM-binding
site to the solvent, which is linked to the conformation of the side
chain of a conserved residue Tyr70.

==== Body
Introduction
Arsenic is the most
ubiquitous environmental toxic substance that
enters our food and water supply from both geochemical and anthropogenic
sources.1 It poses a serious threat to
human health and, consequently, ranks first on the 2017 Environmental
Protection Agency’s comprehensive environmental response, compensation,
and liability act list of hazardous substances (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/spl/). This group 1 carcinogen is associated with a number human diseases
including lung, bladder, and skin cancers, as well as neuropathy,
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.2,3 It causes developmental
delay in infants and children if the mother is chronically exposed
to arsenic during pregnancy or if infants are fed rice baby food containing
arsenic (https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm367263.htm).4

Arsenic is acted on biologically,
creating an arsenic biogeocycle.5 Members
of every kingdom, from
bacteria to humans, biomethylate arsenite, producing the trivalent
species methylarsenite (MAs(III)), dimethylarsenite (DMAs(III)) and,
to a limited degree, volatile trimethylarsine (TMAs(III)).1,6 The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme As(III) SAM methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.137) (termed ArsM in microbes and AS3MT in animals). In
microbes, arsenic methylation is a detoxification process, but in
humans, the production of MAs(III) and DMAs(III) has been proposed
to increase arsenic toxicity and potentially carcinogenicity.7,8

CmArsM from the acidothermoacidophilic eukaryotic red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae sp. 5508 from Yellowstone
National Park is a 400-residue thermostable enzyme (44 980
Da, accession number ACN39191) that methylates As(III) to a final
product of volatile TMAs(III), conferring arsenic resistance.9 Nearly all ArsM orthologs have four conserved
cysteine residues, which are Cys44, Cys72, Cys174, and Cys224 in CmArsM
(Supporting Information Figure S1).10,11 Substitution of any of the four eliminates the first methylation
step (As(III) to MAs(III)), but either the C44A or C72A derivative
is still able to carry out the second step, methylation of MAs(III).
Cys44 and Cys72 form a disulfide bond that we hypothesize reduces
a transient enzyme-bound pentavalent intermediate, whereas Cys174
and Cys224 form the binding site for trivalent arsenicals. We previously
solved the structure of CmArsM to 1.6 Å without ligands and with
As(III) or SAM. From a combination of structural and biochemical results,
we proposed a catalytic cycle involving a disulfide bond cascade.12,13

Here, we determined the rates of the first two steps of methylation,
As(III) to MAs(III) and MAs(III) to DMAs (the presumed product, DMAs(III),
is rapidly oxidized to DMAs(V) in air, so it will be referred to simply
as DMAs in this study). When As(III) was used as the substrate, the
first methylation step, As(III) → MAs(III), was rapid, whereas
the second methylation step, MAs(III) → DMAs, was considerably
slower. In contrast, when methylation was assayed using MAs(III) as
the substrate, the rate was somewhat faster than the first methylation
step. Thus, the rate of the second methylation step, MAs(III) →
DMAs, depends on whether the initial substrate is As(III) or MAs(III).
Immediately following the methylation of As(III) to MAs(III), the
orientation of the methyl group is inferred to be facing the S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) product in the SAM-binding
site. In order to carry out the next methylation reaction, the methyl
group must leave the SAM site to allow a new molecule of SAM to bind.
We propose that, when MAs(III) is the product of As(III) methylation,
the orientation of the methyl group is adjacent to the SAM-binding
site and prevents the SAH product from leaving. This hinders the entrance
of another SAM molecule, creating a kinetic block between the first
and second methylation steps. To examine the structural basis for
this slow step, we obtained several new crystal structures, including
MAs(III)-bound CmArsM. In this structure, the orientation of the methyl
group is facing toward the solvent, the predicted conformation when
MAs(III) is the substrate. In this conformation, an aqueous channel
to the active site is occluded, preventing exchange of the product
SAH for another SAM substrate. In addition, the aromatic side chain
of Tyr70, a residue conserved in most bacterial and animal ArsM orthologs,
appears to block the aqueous channel when the arsenic binding site
is filled but not when SAM is bound. We propose that slow reorientation
of the methyl group from the SAM-binding site to the solvent is rate-limiting
in methylation of inorganic arsenic, with the position of the side
chain of Tyr70 gating the ligand access.

Results
Rate-Limiting
Step between the First and Second Methylation
Steps
Methylation was assayed with either As(III) or MAs(III)
as the substrate (Figure 1). CmArsM is a heat-stable enzyme; hence, the initial methylation
reactions were assayed by HPLC ICP-MS at 60 °C.14 When As(III) was the substrate, MAs was formed slightly
faster than DMAs (Figure 1A, inset), but after 10 min, the amount of MAs decreased,
and DMAs continued to increase (Figure 1A) (because the reactions were terminated by the oxidation
with H2O2 to liberate bound products, the oxidation
state of the arsenicals cannot be deduced). When MAs(III) was the
substrate, methylation to DMAs was also rapid (Figure 1B). As a thermostable enzyme, CmArsM is much
more active at higher temperatures, which makes it difficult to observe
the early events. To slow the reaction, the temperature was decreased
to 37 °C, and methylation from As(III) to MAs and then to DMAs
was assayed. At 37 °C, the conversion of As(III) to MAs was clearly
faster than the methylation of As(III) to DMAs (Figure 2). This indicates that the second methylation
step (MAs → DMAs) is considerably slower than the first methylation
step (As → MAs) when As(III) is the initial substrate. To directly
compare the rates of methylation with either As(III) or MAs(III) as
the substrate, a FRET assay was used to measure SAH production at
37 °C (Figure 3).15 In this assay, the rate of conversion
of MAs → DMAs with MAs(III) as the substrate was greater or
equal to the rate of conversion of As → MAs with As(III) as
the substrate. Thus, when As(III) was the substrate, the rate of MAs
→ DMAs was slower than As → MAs, but with MAs(III) as
the substrate, the rate of MAs → DMAs was as fast or faster
than As → MAs. These results show that the overall rate of
As(III) to DMAs is slower than the individual rates of the first and
second methylation reactions, which are intrinsically similar. This
demonstrates that there must be a rate-limiting reaction or conformational
change between the addition of the first and second methyl groups.
We propose that this slow step involves reorientation of the methyl
group of MAs(III) from SAH-facing to solvent-facing.

and second steps of CmArsM methylation. Methylation
was assayed in a final volume of 1 mL containing 1 mM SAM, 5 mM GSH,
2 μM purified CmArsM, and 10 μM of either As(III) (A)
or MAs(III) (B) at 60 °C, as described under Materials and Methods. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated
times, and the reaction were terminated by the addition of 10% (v/v)
H2O2, final concentration. Arsenicals were speciated
by HPLC-ICP-MS. Inset: As(III) methylation at shorter times.

was assayed as described
in the legend to Figure 1 except that the temperature was 37 °C.

Figure 3 Methylation activity with either As(III) or MAs(III). Methylation
activity was assayed at 37 °C by conversion of SAM to SAH using
a EPIgeneous methyltransferase assay kit (Cisbio Bioassays, Bedford,
MA), as described under Materials and Methods. The assay was carried out for the indicated times in 384-well microtiter
plates in a buffer consisting of 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM GSH, 1 μM purified CmArsM
and 10 μM of either As(III) or MAs(III). SAH production was
estimated from the HTRF.

New CmArsM Crystal Structures Provide Insights into the Rate-Limiting
Step
To gain insights into the nature of the rate-limiting
step, we solved the structure of MAs(III)-bound wild-type CmArsM at
2.27 Å resolution (PDB ID 5JWN). The structural model of the wild-type
enzyme with bound MAs(III) contains 328 residues from residue Val50
to Ser371 (Figure 4). An expanded view of the structure shows that MAs(III) is bound
to conserved cysteine residues Cys174 and Cys224. The distance between
the As atom of MAs(III) and the S atoms of Cys174 and Cys224 is 2.3
and 2.5 Å, respectively. Significantly, the methyl group of MAs(III)
is located in an aqueous channel that leads to the solvent, the predicted
conformation when MAs(III) is the substrate for a second round of
methylation. Biochemical analysis indicates that the binding of SAM
during the catalytic cycle produces a conformation of CmArsM that
is different from the apo- or arsenical-bound forms.16 The previously reported SAM-bound structure of CmArsM (PDB
ID 4FR0) has
a loop consisting of residues 51 to 80 that moves 6.3 Å in the
direction of the As(III) binding site relative to the MAs(III)-bound
structure (Figure 5A).16 In the SAM-bound CmArsM structure,
the distance between the sulfur atoms of Cys74 and Cys170 is 2.1 Å,
which suggests the formation of a disulfide bond between those two
residues at some step during the catalytic cycle. Superposition of
MAs(III)-bound CmArsM and SAM-bound CmArsM gives a root-mean-square
distance (rmsd) of 1.25 Å. This high value is consistent with
the substantial conformational change caused by the movement of the
N-terminal loop toward the As(III)-binding site during catalysis.
The distance of the S-methyl group of SAM to the
As atom of MAs(III) is 4.9 Å (Figure 6A). This orientation indicates that the S-methyl group is poised for transferring from SAM to the
As atom of MAs(III), the conformation that would be expected during
the second round of methylation.

consists of an N-terminal domain, As(III) binding domain, and a C-terminal
domain. Inset: the expanded view of the active site shows the conserved
cysteine residues represented by ball-and-stick and colored green
(carbon), blue (nitrogen), red (oxygen), or yellow (sulfur). The purple
sphere is the arsenic atom, and the light blue sphere is a Ca2+ ion found in the SAM-binding site. MAs(III) is bound between
conserved residues Cys174 and Cys224.

Figure 5 Tyr70 gates substrate access to the active site. (A) Superposition
of wild-type CmArsM structures with bound MAs(III) (light orange)
and bound SAM (light gray) indicates that the main chain (Cα–Cα) of Tyr70 differs by 4.1 Å in the
two structures. In the SAM-bound structure, Tyr70 is closer to the
As(III) binding site than in the MAs(III)-bound structure, suggesting
that the hydroxyphenyl side chain of Tyr70 sterically hinders binding
of arsenicals when SAM is bound. (B) The surface representation of
the MAs(III)-bound structure (light gray) shows that the Tyr70 is
in the solvent channel oriented toward the As-binding site and a SAM
molecule modeled into the SAM-binding site in ball-and-stick. (C)

In this structure, the side chain of Tyr70 is oriented away from the
SAM-binding site, allowing SAM and SAH access to the active site.

and SAM. (A) Stereo
view of the superimposition of the MAs(III)-bound (light orange) and
SAM-bound (light gray) structures, with an rmsd of 1.25 Å. The
ternary complex of CmArsM with bound MAs(III) and SAM was modeled
by superposition of their individual structures. The distances from
the S-methyl group of SAM to the sulfur atom of conserved
cysteine residues and to the arsenic atom of MAs(III) are indicated.
(B) The PhAs(III)-bound C72A structure was superimposed with the SAM-bound
wild-type CmArsM structure, with an rmsd of 1.25 Å. The distances
of the S-methyl group of SAM to the sulfur atom of
conserved residues Cys174 and Cys224 and to the arsenic atom of PhAs(III)
are indicated. The atoms representation and the coloring are the same
as that described in Figure 4.

In addition, we solved the structure
of a PhAs(III)-bound C72A
derivative with an alanine substitution for conserved cysteine residue
Cys72 at 1.97 Å resolution (PDB ID 5EG5) (Supporting Information Figure S2). CmArsM is able to methylate aromatic arsenicals such
as PhAs(III). Methylation of PhAs(III) is the equivalent of the second
methylation step (MAs → DMAs). The structure of PhAs(III)-bound
wild-type CmArsM (PDB ID 4KW7) has been previously reported. The benzene ring cannot
fit into the space between SAM and the arsenic atom and, as expected,
is oriented toward the solvent. The structure of MAs(III)-bound CmArsM
is superimposable with PhAs(III)-bound CmArsM with an rmsd of 0.23
Å (Supporting Information Figure S6A).
The methyl group of MAs(III) and the benzene ring of PhAs(III) are
both oriented toward the solvent, the expected substrate-bound form.
In the structure with the trivalent form of the aromatic arsenical
poultry growth promoter roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenearsenite),
the hydroxynitrobenzene ring is similarly oriented. Thus, in the structure
of CmArsM with three different bound organoarsenicals, the molecule
is in the substrate-bound form, and the methylation reaction is the
equivalent of the second round of methylation.

The MAs(III)-bound
structure includes an N-terminal domain (the
SAM-binding domain), a middle As(III)-binding domain, and a C-terminal
domain of unknown function. In the PhAs(III)-bound structure of wild-type
CmArsM, a disulfide bond is observed between Cys44 and Cys72, which
has been proposed to be an obligatory intermediate in the first methylation
step. In that structure, the N-terminal domain contains two small
310 helices and is followed by a long mobile loop, which
moves from the SAM-binding site toward the As(III) binding site during
the catalytic cycle. However, the loop containing the conserved residue
Cys44 is not resolved in the CmArsM MAs(III)-bound structure, perhaps
because it is disordered when the disulfide bond is not present. The
electron densities of the bound MAs(III) and conserved cysteine residues
Cys174 and Cys224 are shown in Supporting Information Figure S4A. MAs(III) occupancy was partial during several rounds
of the structural refinement, with a high temperature factor for MAs(III)
(71.61 Å2). The CmArsM-bound MAs(III) structure adopts
a pyramidal geometry in which the As atom of MAs(III) is coordinated
with the S atoms of Cys174 and Cys224 (Figure 7A). The two S atoms and the C atom of the
methyl group are each at an average distance of 3.7 Å from each
other. Potential hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of the
protein with the MAs(III) ligand were identified using LigPlot+ analysis
(Supporting Information Figure S5A).17 In addition to the sulfur atoms of Cys174 and
Cys224, only Glu223 interacts with the bound ligand.

Figure 7 Detailed analysis of
the As-binding site. (A) MAs(III) is located
between conserved residues Cys174 and Cys224 in the MAs(III)-bound
structure. In the pyramidal binding site, the distances between the
As atom of MAs(III) and the sulfur thiolates of Cys174 and Cys224
are 2.5 and 2.4 Å, respectively. The thiolate of Cys72 is 7.3
Å away from the arsenic atom of MAs(III). The carbon atom of
MAs(III) serves as a third arsenic ligand. Each of the liganding atoms
are at an average distance of 3.7 Å from each other. (B) PhAs(III)
in the C72A structure is located between Cys174 and Cys224. The distances
between As atom of PhAs(III) and the sulfur thiolates of Cys174 and
Cys224 are 2.5 and 2.3 Å, respectively. In this pyramidal binding
site, the central arsenic atom is coordinated with Cys174 and Cys224
at an average distance of 2.4 Å and the C1 carbon atom of PhAs(III)
at an average distance of 3.4 Å. Both the methyl group of MAs(III)
and the hydroxyphenyl ring of PhAs(III) are oriented toward the solvent
channel. The atoms are represented by ball and stick and colored as
in Figure 4.

To further examine the structural
basis for the second methylation
step, the structure of the PhAs(III)-bound C72A derivative was compared
with the MAs(III)-, PhAs(III)-, and SAM-bound structures of wild-type
CmArsM. In the C72A structure, PhAs(III) is bound between conserved
cysteines residues Cys174 and Cys224 (Supporting Information Figure S3A). The residues are well-defined in the
2Fo–Fc electron density map contoured at 1.0 σ. The electron densities
of PhAs(III) bound to Cys174 and Cys224 are shown in Supporting Information Figure S4B. The MAs(III)- and C72A
PhAs(III)-bound structures can be superposed with an rmsd of 0.24
Å over 322 aligned Cα residues (Supporting Information Figure S6A). In both the MAs(III)-bound wild-type
CmArsM (Figure 5A)
and the PhAs(III)-bound C72A (Supporting Information Figure S3A) structures, the bound organoarsenicals are sandwiched
between Tyr70, Glu223, and Gly222. The hydrogen bonds and non-bonded
interactions of PhAs(III) with the nearby residues may serve to stabilize
the PhAs(III)-bound form (Table 1). Similarly, the PhAs(III)-bound structures
of the wild-type CmArsM and C72A proteins are basically superimposable
(rmsd of 0.19 Å) (Supporting Information Figure S6B), with similar pyramidal geometries of the PhAs(III)
(Figure 7B). The presence
of the Cys44–Cys72 disulfide bond in the wild type and its
absence in C72A apparently makes no difference in the binding of PhAs(III).
This is not unexpected because neither Cys72 nor a Cys44–Cys72
disulfide bond is required for the methylation of either MAs(III)
or PhAs(III).

atoms of MAs(III) or PhAs(III) with amino acid atoms.

The PhAs(III)-bound C72A structure
superimposes less well with
the wild-type SAM-bound structure (rmsd of 1.25 Å), again because
of a difference in the position of the N-terminal loop. The sulfur
atoms of Cys174 and Cys224 in the C72A PhAs(III)-bound structure are
7.8, 5.5, and 5.7 Å, respectively, from the S-methyl group of SAM in the superimposed structures (Figure 6B). The distance of the S-methyl group of SAM to the As atom of PhAs(III) is 4.1
Å, indicating that it is poised for transfer (Figure 6B). The S-methyl
group of SAM is 7.8 Å distant from the Cβ atom of PhAs(III)-bound
C72A. In these structures, the SAM entry is predicted to be restricted
in part because the R group of either MAs(III) or PhAs(III) interacts
with residues Tyr70, Gly222, and Glu223 (Supporting Information Figure S5) neighboring the As(III) binding site.

Tyr70 Gates Ligand Binding
We propose that the orientation
of Tyr70 also provides a gating mechanism for substrate access to
the active site. In both MAs(III)-bound CmArsM (Figure 5A,B) and PhAs(III)-bound C72A (Supporting Information Figure S3A,B), the hydroxyphenyl
ring of Tyr70 is oriented toward the SAM site, but the arsenic binding
site is open. In the SAM-bound structure, the Tyr70 side chain is
flipped away from the SAM-binding site (Figure 5A,C). In this conformation, the SAM site
is open but the arsenic binding site is occluded. This is reflected
in a 4.1 Å movement of the Cα of Tyr70 in the SAM-bound
structure compared with the MAs(III)-bound wild type enzyme (Figure 5A). In the PhAs(III)-bound
C72A structure, this difference is 3.5 Å (Supporting Information Figure 3A). In the SAM-bound structure,
the loop that includes Try70 toward the As(III) binding site by 6.3
Å is relative to either the MAs(III)- or PhAs(III)-bound structure.
With wild-type CmArsM, this movement brings Cys72 and Cys174 close
enough to each other to be able to form the disulfide bond observed
in the SAM-bound structure.16 These results
indicate that the Tyr70 hydroxyphenyl ring occludes the aqueous channel
to bulk solvent when either MAs(III) or PhAs(III) is bound, preventing
the SAM molecule from leaving the active site. In the SAM-bound conformation,
the Tyr70 ring is oriented away from the aqueous channel, allowing
the exchange of the SAH product for another SAM substrate but forming
a Cys72–Cys174 disulfide that prevents binding of arsenicals.
We conclude that Tyr70 gates the substrate access to the active site.

Discussion
Arsenic methylation is a widespread biotransformation
process that
is catalyzed by the enzyme As(III) S-adenosylmethionine
methyltransferase. The enzyme methylates trivalent As(III) up to three
times, producing mono-, di-, and trimethylated species. In microbes,
ArsM clearly catalyzes the detoxification of this toxic metalloid.
In humans, arsenic methylation by the orthologous AS3MT has been proposed
to transform inorganic arsenic into the more toxic and potentially
more carcinogenic18 species MAs(III) and
DMAs(III). When MAs(III) and DMAs(III) are excreted in urine, oxidization
by air converts them to the pentavalent species MAs(V) and DMAs(V).19,20 A high ratio of urinary MAs/DMAs has been associated with various
arsenic-related diseases,21−24 while the reverse appears to be protective.25 We previously showed that MAs(III),
the product of this first methylation step (As(III) → MAs(III)),
dissociates very slowly from both human AS3MT12 and CmArsM.14 This increases the retention
time of MAs(III) in the cytosol of human cells, which may be a critical
factor in arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity. At longer times the
second methylation step (MAs(III) → DMAs(III)) predominates,
and the major product is the dimethylated species, which rapidly leaves
the cells. Thus, the faster the MAs(III) is converted to DMAs(III),
the faster the arsenic can be cleared from the body and the less time
it resides inside of cells. It is therefore crucial to understand
what governs the ratio of MAs to DMAs, which we predict is related
to the catalytic mechanism of AS3MT.

Here, we examined the first
two methylation steps in more detail
with the AS3MT ortholog CmArsM. With As(III) as the substrate, MAs(III)
is formed rapidly, and DMAs(III) more slowly, especially at 37 °C,
where the reaction rate is slower. With MAs(III) as the substrate,
MAs(III) → DMAs(III) is as rapid as As(III) → MAs(III)
when As(III) is the substrate. These results demonstrate that the
two steps have intrinsically similar rates, indicating that the slower
rate of the second methylation step when As(III) is the substrate
is due to a kinetic block that prevents MAs(III) from dissociating
from the enzyme. Retaining a substrate in the active site might be
expected to accelerate the catalysis because it would eliminate a
diffusion-limited step, but that is not the case in this situation.
Thus, the MAs(III) product of the first step is not equivalent to
the MAs(III) substrate of the second step, even though there is a
single active site. We propose that the position of the methyl group
in MAs(III) differs in two stages (Figure 8). When As(III) and SAM are both bound, the S-methyl group of SAM must face the arsenic atom (Figure 8A). When MAs(III)
is the product of As(III) methylation, the methyl group is expected
to be located between the sulfur of SAH and the arsenic atom (Figure 8B). For the second
methylation to occur, the SAH product must exchange with another molecule
of SAM. However, the As-methyl group of the MAs(III) product could
sterically clash with the S-methyl group of SAM unless
it is reoriented away from the SAM-binding site (Figure 8C). Once it attains its new
orientation, MAs(III) would become the substrate for the second methylation
step. We propose that rate of reorientation of the methyl group is
a rate-limiting step between the first and second methylation reactions.

Figure 8 Reorientation
of the As-methyl group is rate-limiting for catalysis.
(A) As(III) is positioned between its binding site composed of Cys174
and Cys224 and the SAM S-methyl group. (B) The methyl
group is transferred from SAM to As(III), forming a MAs(III)-bound
intermediate in which the As-methyl group is oriented toward SAH.
(C) Slow reorientation of the As-methyl group toward bulk solvent
opens the SAM-binding site, allowing exchange of SAH for SAM. In this
conformation, MAs(III) becomes the substrate for the second round
of methylation.

If the rate-limiting
step in arsenic methylation in human AS3MT
could be overcome, it might be possible to increase the rate of clearance
of arsenic from the body, which might diminish the risk of arsenic-related
diseases. There are two possibilities to accomplish this goal. One
is to utilize allosteric modulators that increase the reaction rate.
We identified a potential allosteric site in hAS3MT and are developing
small molecule effectors.15,26 Using this strategy
it may be possible to identify activators of hAS3MT in the future.
A second strategy is to change residues such as Tyr70 in the active
site that are responsible for sterically blocking reorientation of
the methyl group. A detailed structure–function analysis of
this region of the enzyme is in progress.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, Missouri, USA) unless otherwise mentioned.

Purification
of CmArsM Enzymes
CmArsM lacking 31 residues
from the N-terminus and 28 residues from the C-terminus with a C-terminal
histidine tag (termed simply wild-type CmArsM) was expressed and purified
as described previously.11 The C72A derivative
was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA). The forward and reverse
oligonucleotide primers used for cysteine to alanine mutagenesis (changes
underlined) were 5′-GTCCTGGAAAAGTTCTACGGTGCCGGGTCTACGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTAGACCCGGCACCGTAGAACTTTTCCAGGAC-3′. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing
the entire gene. When expressed in Escherichia coli, C72A was produced in a soluble form in amounts comparable to the
parental CmArsM. Purified enzymes were stored at −80 °C
until use. Protein concentrations were estimated from the absorbance
at 280 nm. Before crystallization, purified proteins were exchanged
into a buffer containing 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 M NaCl
and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).

Cocrystallization of CmArsM
and Derivatives with Organoarsenicals
Crystallization was
performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method with a variety of crystal screen conditions from Hampton Research
(Aliso Viejo, California, USA), Emerald Biosciences Inc. (Bainbridge
Island, Washington, USA), and Jena Biosciences GmbH (Jena, Germany).27 For cocrystallization with MAs(III), 20 μL
of wild-type CmArsM at 18 mg/mL was mixed with 20 μL of 2 mM
MAs(III) and incubated on ice for 20 min before crystallization. Crystals
were obtained by mixing 2.0 μL of protein solutions containing
MAs(III) with equal volumes of reservoir solution consisting of 18%
PEG 3350, 0.2 M calcium acetate, and 0.1 M Tris–HCl at pH 7.0.
Cocrystallization of C72A with 1 mM phenylarsenite (PhAs(III)) was
performed as described previously.16

X-ray Data Collection and Structure Refinement
Crystals
were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (25% PEG 3350, 0.2 M
calcium acetate, 0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol)
and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data sets
of wild-type MAs(III)-bound CmArsM and PhAs(III)-bound C72A were collected
at the southeast regional collaborative access team (SER-CAT) facility
at advanced photon source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory. Data
were obtained from 360 image frames with 1° rotation angle about
φ using a MAR-300 CCD detector under standard cryogenic conditions
(100 K) at a synchrotron beam line 22-ID with a crystal to detector
distance of 200 mm. Data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled
with the HKL2000 suite.28 Crystals of CmArsM
cocrystallized with MAs(III) diffracted at 2.27 Å with the space
group of C2, one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and cell parameters
of a = 85.56 Å; b = 47.27 Å; c = 100.54 Å; and β = 113.9°. Crystals of
PhAs(III)-bound C72A diffracted at a resolution of 1.97 Å. The
crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell
parameters of a = 85.26 Å, b = 47.37 Å, c = 100.30 Å, and β
= 113.6°.

The structures were determined by molecular replacement
with Phaser in the CCP4 suite.29 The unliganded
crystal structure of CmArsM (PDB ID 4FS8) was used as a template for molecular
replacement. The model and electron density map were visualized using
COOT software,30 and the structure was
refined using REFMAC5.31 The final R and Rfree converged to 18.9
and 25.7% for MAs(III)-bound CmArsM and 19.5 and 25.0% for PhAs(III)-bound
C72A. A Ramachandran plot for MAs(III)-bound CmArsM calculated using
PROCHECK32 indicated that 97.0% of the
residues are in the most favored region, 2.4% of the residues in the
additionally allowed regions, and 0.6% of the residues in the generously
allowed region. The final data collection, refinement statistics,
and protein data bank accession codes are given in Table 2. Molecular models were drawn
with PYMOL.33 Ligplot+ was used to illustrate
the hydrogen bonds and non-bonded interactions of MAs(III)-bound CmArsM
and PhAs(III)-bound C72A.17

Assay of CmArsM Activity
Methylation activity of purified
CmArsM was assayed in 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0)
containing 0.3 M NaCl, 5 mM GSH, and 1 mM SAM, as described previously
at 60 or 37 °C, as indicated.14 Unless
otherwise noted, the reactions were terminated by adding 10% (v/v)
H2O2, final concentration, to oxidize all arsenic
species. Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation using a 3
kDa cut-off Amicon ultrafilter. The products of As(III) or MAs(III)
methylation were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using a Hamilton PRP-X100 C18 reverse phase column (Hamilton
Co., Reno, NV) and quantified using a PerkinElmer ELAN DRC-e inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), as described previously.14

CmArsM activity was also assayed with
an EPIgeneous methyltransferase assay kit (Cisbio Bioassays, Bedford,
MA) by measuring the conversion of SAM to SAH as described previously.15 The reaction has two steps: (1) the enzymatic
reaction, which converts SAM to SAH, and (2) the detection step that
quantifies SAH production. Both steps were carried out sequentially
in the same well of a low volume 384-well microtiter plate, with a
total volume of 20 μL (10 μL for the enzymatic step and
10 μL for the detection step) in a buffer consisting of 50 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM
GSH, 1 μM CmArsM, and 10 μM of either As(III) or MAs(III).
After incubating for 1 min, 10 μM SAM, final concentration,
was added to initiate the reaction. The reactions were carried out
at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reactions were terminated
by addition of the proprietary detection reagent, followed by SAH-d2
and anti-SAH-Lumi4-Tb reagents. Fluorescence was measured at both
665 and 620 nm with excitation at 337 nm in a Synergy H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader. The homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)
was calculated from the ratio of emission at 665 and 620 nm. The concentration
of SAH was calculated from a calibration curve of the HTRF with known
concentrations of SAH.
