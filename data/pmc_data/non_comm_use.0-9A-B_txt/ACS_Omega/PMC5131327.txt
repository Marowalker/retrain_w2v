Prostate cancer cells overexpress the prostate-specific membrane
antigen (PSMA) receptors on the surface. Targeting the PSMA receptor
creates a unique opportunity for drug delivery. Docetaxel is a Food
and Drug Administration-approved drug for treating metastatic and
androgen-independent prostate cancer, and mocetinostat is a potent
inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases. In this study, we prepared
reduction-sensitive polymersomes presenting folic acid on the surface
and encapsulating either docetaxel or mocetinostat. The presence of
folic acid allowed efficient targeting of the PSMA receptor and subsequent
internalization of the polymeric vesicles in cultured LNCaP prostate
cancer cell spheroids. The intracellular reducing agents efficiently
released docetaxel and mocetinostat from the polymersomes. The combination
of the two drug-encapsulated polymersome formulations significantly
(p < 0.05) decreased the viability of the LNCaP
cells (compared to free drugs or control) in three-dimensional spheroid
cultures. The calculated combination index value indicated a synergistic
effect for the combination of mocetinostat and docetaxel. Thus, our PSMA-targeted drug-encapsulated polymersomes has
the potential to lead to a new direction in prostate cancer therapy
that decreases the toxicity and increases the efficacy of the drug
delivery systems.

1 Introduction
In the United States, prostate cancer is the most common carcinoma
in men after skin malignancy.1 Approximately
one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their
lifetime.2 Surgery, radiation, and conventional
chemotherapy are the common treatment options. However, in conventional
chemotherapy, the anticancer drugs distribute throughout the body
and destroy the normal cells as well as cancer cells, causing cytotoxicity
and side effects.3,4 To increase the efficacy, a long-circulating
drug delivery vehicle that recognizes the cancer cells and releases
the contents in the cytosol is required. Various nanocarriers (e.g.,
polymeric micelles, liposomes, nanoparticle-aptamer, polymersomes,
and nanoparticle delivering miRNA, siRNA, and cell-penetrating peptide)
have been developed for cancer treatment with varying degrees of success.5−12 Polymersomes are robust bilayer vesicles prepared from synthetic,
amphiphilic block copolymers. The incorporation of polyethylene glycol
(PEG) as the hydrophilic block renders the vesicles long circulating.13 The bilayer of the polymersomes encapsulates
hydrophobic drugs, and the aqueous core incorporates the hydrophilic
drugs.13 The nanocarriers usually escape
through the leaky vasculature and accumulate in the tumor due to the
poor lymphatic drainage (termed as the enhanced permeation and retention
(EPR) effect).14 After passive targeting
by the EPR effect, interactions with a specific receptor on the cell
surface enable cellular internalization of the nanocarriers via endocytosis.4

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an extracellular transmembrane
glycoprotein overexpressed in the malignant prostate tissue15 and is responsible for the uptake of folic acid.16 The androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line expresses
the PSMA receptor. However, the PC3 cells lose the expression of PSMA
as the cancer progresses from the androgen-dependent to the androgen-independent
stage.17,18 Capromab pendetide (PSMA antibody) is the
only prostate cancer imaging agent approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).19 Mocetinostat (MGCD0103)
is an aminophenyl benzamide histone deacetylase (class I enzymes)
inhibitor. Mocetinostat induces hyperacetylation of histones and leads
to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cancer cell lines and the human
tumor xenograft mouse model.20 Currently,
mocetinostat is used in the clinical trials as a monotherapy or as
an adjuvant in many malignancies, although the mechanism is poorly
understood.21 Docetaxel belongs to the
taxoid family and is extracted from the European yew tree.22 It inhibits microtubule depolymerization, causes
mitotic spindle poisoning, and blocks mitoses.23 The US FDA approved docetaxel in 2004 for the treatment
of metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer.24 Recently, we have reported that mocetinostat augments the
activity of docetaxel to induce apoptosis. Mocetinostat upregulates
miR-31, decreases the antiapoptotic protein E2F6, and induces apoptosis
in prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer stem cells.25

Herein, we report a polymersome-based, PSMA-targeted, delivery
system for prostate cancer, encapsulating either docetaxel or mocetinostat.
We employed two FDA-approved polymers to prepare the polymersomes:
PEG as the hydrophilic block and polylactic acid (PLA) as the hydrophobic
block. We connected the two polymer blocks, employing the reduction-sensitive
disulfide linker. We observed that the targeted polymersomes are recognized
by the PSMA receptor and internalized in the prostate cancer cells
LNCaP. Subsequently, the intracellular environment reductively cleaves
the disulfide bond, disturbs the polymersome bilayer structure, and
efficiently releases the encapsulated drugs. We observed that the
combination of the two drug-encapsulated, PSMA-targeted polymersome
formulations significantly (p < 0.05) decreased
the viability of the LNCaP cells (compared to free drugs or control)
in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of the Block Copolymer and Formation
of Polymersomes
To form the polymersomes, we synthesized
amphiphilic block copolymers with a hydrophilic fraction (f) of 25%. We have previously demonstrated that 25% is the
optimal amount of the hydrophilic polymer for forming bilayer vesicles.26 The reduction-sensitive polymer PEG2000–SS–PLA2000 (Figure 1) was synthesized as reported previously.26 We estimated the molecular weight of the synthesized
polymer employing 1H NMR spectroscopy. We expected the
disulfide bond to cleave in the reducing microenvironment of the cell
cytosol.

available distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE)–PEG–folate
lipid (B).

2.1.1 Preparation of Polymersomes
Polymersomes were prepared by the solvent-exchange method.27 We incorporated 5 mol % of the DSPE–PEG2000–folate lipid into the polymersomes to target them
to the PSMA. PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and
hydrolyzes folate.15,19 The size distribution and polydispersity
index of the prepared polymersomes were evaluated by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) (Table 1 and Figure 2). The
morphology of polymersomes was characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figures 3 and 4). We observed that the polymersomes incorporating the folate lipid
were slightly larger in size (238 ± 2 nm) compared to the vesicles
without the lipid (216 ± 4 nm, Table 1). Encapsulation of mocetinostat and docetaxel
in the PSMA-targeted polymersomes increased the size of the nanovesicles,
likely due to the accumulation of the drugs in the bilayer. The encapsulation
efficiencies for mocetinostat and docetaxel were 80 and 44%, respectively.
For ease of visualization, we incorporated 1 mol% of the fluorescent
LR lipid into the bilayer of the polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat.
We encapsulated a small amount of the dye carboxyfluorescein in the
docetaxel-encapsulated vesicles.

2.2 Demonstration of Triggered Contents Release
from the Polymersomes
We encapsulated mocetinostat in the
polymersomes and monitored the reduction-triggered release of the
drug as a function of time with different concentrations of added
glutathione (GSH). GSH is a tripeptide consisting of glutamic acid,
cysteine, and glycine. The majority of GSH (90%) is available in the
cytosol, and its increased level is correlated with progression and
proliferation of cancerous cells.28 Treatment
with circulation levels of glutathione (2 μM) released less
than 1% of the drug in 30 min (Figure 5, black squares). We increased the concentration of
GSH to match the extracellular matrix level (50 μM) and observed
10% release of encapsulated mocetinostat (Figure 6, red circles). The cytosolic concentration
of glutathione (1–5 mM) led to substantial release (30–85%)
of the encapsulated drug from the polymersomes (Figure 5, blue triangles and magenta stars). Because
of the very low amount of docetaxel encapsulated in the polymersomes
(nanomolar concentration), we did not study the release profile from
these vesicles in the presence of varying concentrations of added
reducing agents.

Figure 5 Reduction-mediated release profile of encapsulated mocetinostat
from the polymersomes. The drug-encapsulated vesicles were treated
with 2 μM (black squares), 50 μM (red circles), 1 mM (blue
triangles), and 5 mM (pink stars) of GSH. The lines connecting the
data points are also shown.

stained with the Hoechst dye (blue image, 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole

carboxyfluorescein (fluorescein isothiocyanate filter). The merged
images are shown in the third panel. (A) PSMA-targeted polymersomes

and (D) nontargeted polymersomes after 1 h incubation.

2.3 Uptake of the Polymersomes in Monolayer Culture
of Prostate Cancer Cells
To demonstrate cytosolic localization
in the prostate cancer cells, we prepared polymersomes incorporating
5% DSPE–PEG2000–folate into the bilayer.
The LNCaP prostate cancer cells overexpress the PSMA receptor on the
surface.29 We incubated the cultured LNCaP
cells with PSMA-targeted and nontargeted polymersomes (encapsulating
carboxyfluorescein) for different times, washed the cells, and imaged
them employing a fluorescence microscope (Figure 6). We observed higher localization of the
targeted polymersomes after 1 h of incubation with the LNCaP cells.
We analyzed the images employing the Image J software. The corrected
total cell fluorescence (CTCF) intensity clearly indicated that the
targeted polymersomes internalized more in the LNCap cells compared
to the nontargeted vesicles (Figure 7).

Figure 7 CTCF analysis of the images of the LNCaP cells incubated with the
PSMA-targeted polymersomes (green bars) and the nontargeted polymersomes
(black bars).

After demonstrating efficient cellular internalization, we proceeded
to determine the effectiveness of the PSMA-targeted drug-encapsulated
polymersomes. We investigated the effect of targeted polymersomes
on both PSMA-positive (LNCaP) and PSMA-negative (PC3) prostate cancer
cell lines. The cultured LNCaP and PC3 cells were treated with the
polymersome formulations encapsulating mocetinostat or docetaxel and
the free drugs for 48 h. Subsequently, the cell viability was examined
by the Alamar Blue assay because the reagents used for this assay
do not interact with nanoparticles.30 We
observed that the PSMA-targeted polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat
(or docetaxel) significantly reduced (p ≤
0.001) the cell viability compared to the control (medium only) for
the LNCaP cells. We also observed dose-dependent cellular toxicity
for the drug-encapsulated polymersomes (Figure 8). As the concentration is increased, the
PSMA-targeted, drug-encapsulated polymersomes showed higher toxicity
to the LNCaP cells. For example, with 10 nM encapsulated docetaxel,
the viability of the LNCaP cells decreased to 54% (Figure 8B). Interestingly, we also
observed much less cellular toxicity in the PC3 cells, suggesting
that the PSMA-targeted polymersomes encapsulating moctinostat/docetaxel
can internalize through the PSMA receptor on the LNCaP cells (Figure 9). Literature reports
indicate that the PC3 cells express a small amount of PSMA receptors
on the surface, and the expression level is upregulated by the basic
fibroblast growth factor.17

bars denote the mean ± SEM.

After demonstrating the effects of the PSMA-targeted drug-encapsulated
polymersomes, we proceeded to determine the synergistic effect of
the two formulations encapsulating mocetinostat and docetaxel. The
cells were treated with
the combination of docetaxel- and mocetinostat-encapsulated vesicles
as well as the appropriate controls. The results revealed significant
(p ≤ 0.0001) cytotoxicity for the combination
formulation (5 nM docetaxel + 10 μM mocetinostat) compared to
the controls for the LNCaP cells (Figure 8C). However, we observed that the cell viability
of the combination formulation was similar to that of the mixture
of the two free drugs (Figure 8C). We note that the drug-encapsulated polymersomes will be
advantageous due to the passive targeting of the vesicles by the EPR
effect and the resultant reduced systemic toxicity. To determine any
synergistic effects in the LNCaP cells, we calculated the combination
index (CI) for combining the targeted polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat
and the targeted polymersomes encapsulating docetaxel employing the
CalcuSyn software (www.biosoft.com.). The CI values indicated that the combination formulation is synergistically
reducing the viability of the LNCaP cells (Table 2). The drug-encapsulated polymersomes were
significantly less toxic to the PC3 cells compared to the LNCaP cells.
We did not observe enhanced cellular toxicity of the combination of
the two drug-encapsulated polymersomes in the PC3 cells (Figure 9). Co-administration
of PSMA-targeted polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat and docetaxel
significantly decreased the viability of the LNCaP cells (p < 0.05) compared to the PC3 cells in monolayer cultures.

2.4 Cytotoxicity in the 3D Spheroid Cultures
Monolayer cell cultures do not adequately model prostate cancer
due to the lack of cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions.31 In contrast to the monolayer cultures, the 3D
spheroids have intercellular interactions, the necrotic cores, and
the heterogeneity that mimics the in vivo tumors.32 To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we have
tested the polymersomes on cultured uniform-sized 3D spheroids of
the LNCaP and PC3 cells. We prepared the spheroids using an agar mold,
and after growing them for 10 days, we incubated them with the polymersomes
and free drugs. On the basis of the results from the monolayer cultures
of the LNCaP cells, we used 5 nM docetaxel and 10 mM mocetinostat
(either free or polymersome-encapsulated) in the spheroids of the
LNCaP and PC3 cells. We observed enhanced cytotoxicity (by the Alamar
Blue assay) for the polymersome-encapsulated mocetinostat (or docetaxel)
compared to the control or the unencapsulated drugs (Figure 10A,B). We also observed that
the combination of the two drug-encapsulated polymersomes was more
potent compared to either mocetinostat or docetaxel (free or encapsulated
in the vesicles, Figure 10C). The combination decreased the cell viability to 39% in
the LNCaP spheroids (Figure 10C, purple bar). The effect of the drug-encapsulated polymersomes
was significantly less in the spheroids of the PC3 cells (Figure 11) compared to the
LNCaP cells (p < 0.001).

targeted polymersomes (purple bar) were more potent compared to the
free drug (orange bar), targeted vesicles without any drug (green

(purple bar) were more potent compared to the free drug (orange bar),

of docetaxel/mocetinostat-encapsulated targeted polymersomes (purple

representative of three individual experiments. Error bars denote
the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis: Student’s t-test where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, and ***p < 0.0001.

where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001,

To determine the penetration depth and the effect of the drug-encapsulated
polymersomes, we sliced (160 μm thick) the treated, LNCaP cell
spheroids using a microtome (Figure 12). We imaged the spheroid slices using a commercially
available live–dead cell imaging kit. The live cells hydrolyze
the calcein-AM dye to calcein (green fluorescence).33 Ethidium homodimer-1 passes through the membranes of damaged
cells, binds to the DNA, and emits a red fluorescence.33 We observed that co-treatment of the spheroids
with mocetinostat- and docetaxel-encapsulated, targeted polymersomes
leads to primarily dead cells (Figure 13A,B). The cells in the control spheroids
(without any treatment) were alive, producing the green fluorescence
(Figure 13C,D). The
CTCF was calculated using software Image J (Figures 13 and 14). The analysis
indicated that the control spheroid slices contain primarily live
cells, whereas the treated slices have mainly the dead cells.

3 Experimental Section
PEG–S–S–PLA was synthesized by ring-opening
polymerization as previously reported from our laboratory.26 Briefly, PEG (MW:2000) was reacted with succinic
anhydride and then conjugated to cystamine dihydrochloride in the
presence of EDC. The PLA polymer was subsequently synthesized from d-,l-lactide and a catalytic quantity of octyl tin
(II).

3.1 Preparation and Characterization of Polymersomes
The polymersomes were prepared by the solvent-exchange method13 using the synthesized PEG2000–SS–PLA6200 and the commercially available fluorescent lissamine rhodamine
lipid [LR; 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (ammonium salt)] in molar
proportions of 95:5, respectively. The LR lipid was dissolved in chloroform
(0.01 mg/mL). The polymer (0.9% w/v) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran
(THF). The chloroform was removed using a rotary evaporator to prepare
a thin film. The polymer solution was added slowly to the thin film,
and then the mixture was added dropwise to a stirred 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.4). Polymersome solutions were stirred for
45 min at room temperature, and then air was passed for 45 min through
the mixture to remove the organic solvent. The formed polymersomes
were sonicated at 25 °C for 70 min (Symphony 117 V, 60 Hz). Subsequently,
the polymersomes were passed through a Sephadex G100 (GE Healthcare)
size-exclusion column to collect dye-encapsulated polymersomes. These
polymersomes were used for the cell viability assays.

3.2 Preparation of Polymersomes Encapsulating
Mocetinostat or Docetaxel (with and without PSMA Targeting)
The nanovesicles were prepared using the PEG1900–SS–PLA6000 polymer, DSPE–PEG2000–folate
lipid, and LR lipid in molar proportions of 95:5:5, respectively.
Mocetinostat and docetaxel were encapsulated into the polymersomes
by the solvent-exchange method.27 The nontargeted
polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat or docetaxel were prepared
the same way without using the DSPE–PEG2000–folate
lipid. Briefly, the polymer and the lipid were dissolved in chloroform.
Mocetinostat and docetaxel (0.125% w/v) were dissolved in THF. The
two drugs were added to the polymer solutions in two different vials
and slowly added to the solution of folate-conjugated lipid in two
different vials. For the ease of visualization, the LR lipid was incorporated
into the polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat, and carboxyfluorescein
(100 μM) was encapsulated along with docetaxel in the other
formulation. The resultant solutions were added dropwise to stirred
HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4). Polymersomes were stirred for 45 min,
and then air was passed through drug-loaded nanovesicles for another
45 min. The nanovesicles were sonicated at 25 °C for 70 min (Symphony
117 V, 60 Hz). The polymersomes (1 mg/mL) were passed through the
Sephadex G100 size-exclusion column to remove the unencapsulated drug.

Drug-loading efficacies (DLE) of the polymersomes were determined
using UV–vis spectroscopy. After passing through the size-exclusion
column, the absorption of the polymersomes was recorded at 230 nm.
The calibration curves were generated for each drug separately. The
DLE for mocetinostat and docetaxel were determined according to the
following equation  

3.3 Size-Distribution Analysis
The size
distributions of the polymersomes were determined by the DLS method,
employing the NanoZS 90 Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments). The measurements
were conducted in disposable polystyrene cuvettes at a scattering
angle of 90° (polymersome concentration: 1 mg/mL). The samples
were equilibrated for 2 min; five repeats were recorded with 10 measurements
for each sample.

3.4 TEM
Copper TEM grids (300-mesh, formvar-carbon
coated, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania) were
prepared by applying a drop of 0.01% poly-l-lysine, allowing
it to stand for 30 s, wicking off the liquid with torn filter paper,
and allowing the grids to air dry. A drop of the polymersomes was
placed on the prepared grid for 30 s and wicked off; grids were allowed
to air dry again. Phosphotungstic acid 0.1%, pH adjusted to 7–8,
was dropped onto the grid containing the sample, allowed to stand
for 2 min, and wicked off. After the grids were dry, images were obtained
using a JEOL JEM-2100 LaB6 transmission electron microscope (JEOL
USA, Peabody, Massachusetts) running at 200 keV.

3.5 AFM
Polymersomes (0.5 mg/mL) were
diluted (10×) in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), dropped on silica
substrates, and incubated for a minute and subjected to an air blow
gun. The AFM measurements were conducted in noncontact mode at a resonance
frequency of 145 kHz and scanning rate of 1.3 Hz and using an NT-MDT
INTEGRA (NT-MDT America). The scanning areas were 5 × 5 μm2 at a resolution of 512 points per line.

3.6 Redox-Triggered Release Study
The
release of mocetinostat from the PSMA-targeted polymersomes was monitored
in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Polymersomes loaded with the
drug (500 μL of 1 mg/mL solution) were dispensed into a dialysis
tube (Spectra/Por Float-A-LyzerG2 Dialysis Tubes, MWCO: 500–1000
Da, diameter: 10 mm, volume: 1 mL). GSH was added after 5 min, and
the concentration of GSH was increased every 30 min. The GSH concentrations
were 2 μM (circulation levels of glutathione),34 50 μM (extracellular matrix level),26 1 mM, and 5 mM (cytosolic concentration of glutathione)26 after the successive addition steps. The absorbance
of the aqueous solution (at 230 nm) from the outside tube was measured
every 5 min using a UV spectrophotometer (Spectramax M5, Molecular
Devices). Subsequently, the percent release was calculated from the
calibration curve.

3.7 Culture of Human Prostate Carcinoma Cells
The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3 were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 medium (without phenol red), supplemented with 1% v/v antibiotics
(penicillin and streptomycin), 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, and 2.05
mM l-glutamate. The cell culture flasks were incubated at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

3.8 Cellular Uptake of PSMA-Targeted Polymersomes
The cultured LNCaP cells (3 × 103) were seeded
in an uncoated 8-well glass bottom plate for 24 hours before the experiment.
When 90% confluent, the PSMA-targeted (20 μL) and the control
polymersomes (20 μL) encapsulating carboxyfluorescein were incubated
with the cells for 30 min. Subsequently, the media were removed, and
the cells were washed thrice with Hanks’ balanced salt solution
(HBSS) to remove the non-internalized polymersomes. Subsequently,
the cell nuclei were stained with HOESCHT 33342 dye (Enzo Life Sciences,
1/1000 dilution) and imaged employing a fluorescence microscope. The
same experiment was repeated with 1 h incubation time with the polymersomes.

3.9 Cytotoxicity Studies in Monolayer Cell Cultures
The Alamar Blue assay was conducted to evaluate the viability of
the human prostate carcinoma cells. The LNCaP and PC3 cells were seeded
at a density of 1 × 103/200 μL in a 96-well
tissue culture plate before the experiment and were allowed to grow
until 80–95% confluent. The plate was divided into six groups:
control, free drugs, nontargeted polymersomes, nontargeted polymersomes
encapsulating drugs, PSMA-targeted polymersomes, and PSMA-targeted
polymersomes encapsulating the drugs. Separately, similar experiments
were conducted for mocetinostat and docetaxel. The control group did
not receive any treatment. Cells treated with mocetinostat formulations
received 5, 10, and 20 μM of free and an equivalent amount of
encapsulated drug. The docetaxel treatment group received 1, 5, and
10 nM of free drug, and the docetaxel-encapsulated polymersomes containing
the same amounts of the drug. The cells were treated with the free
or encapsulated drugs for 48 h at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Subsequently, the cells were washed thrice with sterile
HBSS and replaced with 200 μL fresh media. The cell viability
was determined using the Alamar Blue assay following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Subsequently, we evaluated the effects of the combination
of both drug formulations on the treated cells using the same protocol.
The data presented are normalized to the control.

3.10 Cytotoxicity Studies in a 3D Spheroid Cell
Culture
The LNCaP and PC3 cell spheroids were prepared by
using 96-well 3D Petri Dishes (Microtissues). Briefly, 2% w/v agarose
solution in water was prepared and autoclaved. The cell suspension
(1 × 104 cell/60 μL media) was added to each
3D scaffold. The cells were allowed to grow for 10 days to form the
spheroids. The scaffold was then divided into six groups: control,
nontargeted polymersomes, nontargeted polymersomes encapsulating drugs,
targeted polymersomes, targeted polymersomes encapsulating mocetinostat
or docetaxel. The spheroids were treated for 48 h with the same concentration
of drugs as used for the monolayer studies. Subsequently, the excess
medium was removed, and the spheroids were incubated with TryPLE (recombinant
trypsin, Life Technologies, 100 μL) for 10 min. The dislodged
spheroids were removed and subjected to the Alamar Blue assay. The
data presented are normalized to the control.

3.11 Live–Dead Cellular Assay
The LNCaP spheroids were prepared as described in the previous section.
The live–dead cellular assays were performed on the spheroids
treated with a combination of mocetinostat-encapsulated and docetaxel-encapsulated
PSMA-targeted polymersomes, PSMA-targeted polymersomes, polymersomes,
free drugs, and control. After the treatment and washing, 160 μm
thick slices of the spheroids were prepared using microtome HM 355
S. A commercially available live–dead assay kit (Calcein-AM/Ethidium
homodimer-1, Biotium) for mammalian cells was used to image the live
and dead cells in each of the slices. We analyzed the images employing
the Image J software. We selected three random regions and calculated
the CTCF using the formula  

4 Conclusions
We have prepared polymersomes from the synthesized, amphiphilic
polymers containing PEG as the hydrophilic block. We have successfully
demonstrated that the PSMA can be used to target the polymersomes
actively to prostate cancer cells. After internalization, the large
amount of reducing agent in the cytosol triggers the release of encapsulated
hydrophobic drugs from the polymersomes. A combination of PSMA-targeted
vesicles encapsulating mocetinostat and docetaxel reduced the viability
of LNCaP prostate cancer cells (expressing the PSMA receptor) in 3D
spheroid cultures. The CI value (CI < 1) indicated that the combination
of mocetinostat and docetaxel-encapsulated polymersomes had a synergistic
effect in reducing the viability of the prostate cancer cells. Our
imaging analysis confirmed that the combination of the two drug-encapsulated
polymersomes primarily kills the cancer cells. We expect that our
results will motivate further research into stimuli-responsive, targeted
polymersomes and the use of 3D cellular models for testing the cytotoxicity
of drug formulations.
