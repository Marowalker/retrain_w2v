A new method of data interpretation based
on classical nucleation theory is proposed in this work to elucidate
the influence of solvents on the pre-exponential nucleation factor
and interfacial energy using the induction time data for three crystallization
systems, including isonicotinamide, lovastatin, and phenacetin. In
this method, the pre-exponential nucleation factor is replaced by
the intrinsic nucleation factor multiplied by temperature and divided
by solution viscosity. The proposed method is applied to study the
nucleation kinetics of isonicotinamide, lovastatin, and phenacetin
among various solvents using the induction time data measured in this
work. The results indicate that the intrinsic nucleation factor increases
linearly with increasing square root of interfacial energy in various
solvents for each system.

Introduction
Nucleation is the initial
process for the formation of crystals in solutions. In classical nucleation
theory (CNT),1−3 the
nucleation rate is expressed in the thermally activated Arrhenius
form governed by the pre-exponential nucleation factor and interfacial
energy. The interfacial energy is the energy required to create a
new solid liquid interface for the formation of crystals in solutions.
Traditionally, the interfacial energy is determined from the induction
time measurements by assuming J ∝ ti–1.1,4−7 Generally, the higher the value of interfacial energy,
the more difficult it is for the solute to crystallize.

As the
nucleation behavior of the same solute is greatly influenced by the
choice of solvent, the study of nucleation in various solvents has
long been an important research subject.8−14 Recent
studies have indicated an increasing trend of the interfacial energy
with the increasing corresponding solute–solvent interaction
for the same solute in various solvents.15−18 Apart from
the interfacial energy, nucleation should also be influenced by the
pre-exponential factor based on CNT. However, few studies have been
published regarding to the influence of the solvent type on the pre-exponential
factor for nucleation.

Although the pre-exponential factor is
related to the solute mobility in solutions, it is also implicitly
dependent on the interfacial energy of a crystalline solid according
to the derivation of CNT,2,3,19 which nevertheless has not been experimentally validated in the
literature. Nucleation in various solvents for a system can provide
important information for nucleation rate parameters. In this work,
the influence of the solvent type on nucleation will be investigated
based on CNT to examine the implicit relationship between the pre-exponential
factor and interfacial energy in various solvents using the induction
time data for three common model compounds widely studied in crystal
engineering, including isonicotinamide, lovastatin, and phenacetin.
The chemical structures of these compounds are given in Figure 1. Various common crystal structures
of these compounds have been reported in the literature.20−23

(b) lovastatin, and (c) phenacetin.

Theory
The nucleation rate based
on CNT is expressed as1−3 1  where AJ is the nucleation pre-exponential
factor, γ is the interfacial energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant,  is the molecular volume,
and S = C0/Ceq is the supersaturation ratio. As the solute attachment
for small critical nucleus in a stirred solution should be interface-transfer
control, it yields based on CNT2,3,19 2  where DAB is the
solute diffusivity in the solution.

For simplicity, the solute
diffusivity is usually estimated based on the Stokes–Einstein
equation as1 3  where r0 is the molecular radius of solute and η
is the solution viscosity. As DAB is generally
assumed to be proportional to T/η(T,S) for the same solute among various solvents,10,13,19eq 2 becomes 4  

To differentiate between the effects
of γ1/2 and T/η(T,S) on AJ, the intrinsic
nucleation factor A0 is introduced in
this work as24 5  

Substituting eq 5 into eq 4 yields 6  

Consequently, although AJ in eq 2 is dependent on DAB among various solvents, A0 is not related to the dependence of DAB on T/η(T,S) among various solvents. Substituting eq 5 into eq 1 yields 7  

Thus, J is
expressed in terms of A0 and γ,
as opposed to J commonly adopted in terms of AJ and γ in eq 1.

In the induction time study, the nucleation
event is usually assumed to correspond to a point at which the total
number density of accumulated crystals in a vessel has reached a fixed
(but unknown) value, fN.25−28 Thus, one obtains at the nucleation time ti 8  where fN depends on the measurement device and on the substance. Note
that eq 8 is consistent
with J ∝ ti–1 reported in the literature.1 Based on the study of 28 systems, Mersmann and Bartosch29 estimated fV = 10–4 to 10–3 with a detectable size
of 10 μm. If the intermediate value, fV = 4 × 10–4, for spherical nuclei with kV = π/6 is assumed, it leads to fN = 7.64 × 1011 m–3 proposed by Shiau.24

Substituting eq 1 into eq 8 yields 9  

Experimental induction time data can be evaluated by plotting ln(1/ti) versus 1/T3 ln2S for determination of γ from the
slope and AJ from the intercept, respectively.

Substituting eq 7 into eq 8 yields 10  

Experimental induction time data can be evaluated by plotting ln[η(T,S)/tiT] versus 1/T3 ln2S for determination of γ from the slope and A0 from the intercept, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Tables 1–3 list the experimental average induction time data of each
solute in various solvents measured for various S at the specified temperature for three crystallization systems,
including isonicotinamide, lovastatin, and phenacetin. The induction
time measurements under each condition are repeated three times, and
the deviation of the induction time is generally less than 15%. In
the following, eqs 9 and 10 are applied to determine the nucleation kinetics
in various solvents using the induction time data for each system.

In the application of eq 10, the solution viscosities η(T,S) in various solvents for each system are experimentally
measured in this work using a rotational viscometer (Brookfield DV2T).
The measurements under each condition are repeated three times, and
the deviation of the viscosity value is generally less than 6%.

Figure 2a shows the
measured supersaturation dependence of solution viscosity for isonicotinamide
in various solvents at 303 K, where Ceq for isonicotinamide in each solvent at 303 K is taken from a report
by Hansen et al.22 (Ceq = 210 mg solute/g solvent for methanol, Ceq = 11 mg solute/g solvent for ethyl acetate, Ceq = 23 mg solute/g solvent for acetonitrile,
and Ceq = 37 mg solute/g solvent for acetone). Figure 2b shows the measured
induction time data fitted to eq 10 for isonicotinamide in various solvents at 303 K,
where the induction time data are experimentally obtained in this
work for various initial concentrations cooled to 303 K. Figure 2c shows that A0 increases linearly with increasing γ1/2 for isonicotinamide in various solvents at 303 K, where A0 and γ in each solvent are determined
using the corresponding induction time data fitted to eq 10. On the other hand, Figure 2d shows that no clear relationship
is observed between AJ and γ1/2 for isonicotinamide in various solvents at 303 K, where AJ and γ in each solvent are determined
using the corresponding induction time data fitted to eq 9.

Figure 2 Isonicotinamide
in various
solvents: (a) dependence of η on supersaturation at 303 K; (b)
induction time data fitted to eq 10 at 303 K; (c) linear relationship between A0 and γ1/2 at 303 K; and (d) AJ vs γ1/2 at 303 K.

As shown in Figure 2a, η increases in the
order: acetone < acetonitrile < ethyl acetate < methanol.
Although Figure 2c
shows that A0 increases in the order:
ethyl acetate < acetonitrile < acetone < methanol, AJ in Figure 2d increases in the order: ethyl acetate < methanol
< acetonitrile < acetone, which is different from the increasing
order of A0. It should be noted that η
in methanol is significantly greater than that in other solvents.
Consequently, although A0 in methanol
is the greatest among various solvents, AJ in methanol becomes smaller than that in acetone or acetonitrile
because of eq 5.

Figure 3a shows the
measured supersaturation dependence of solution viscosity for lovastatin
in various solvents at 303 K, where Ceq for lovastatin in each solvent at 303 K is taken from a report by
Sun et al.30 (Ceq = 38 mg solute/g solvent for ethanol, Ceq = 22 mg solute/g solvent for butyl acetate, Ceq = 52 mg solute/g solvent for methanol, Ceq = 31 mg solute/g solvent for ethyl acetate, and Ceq = 105 mg solute/g solvent for acetone). Figure 3b shows the measured
induction time data fitted to eq 10 for lovastatin in various solvents at 303 K, where
the induction time data are experimentally obtained in this work for
various initial concentrations cooled to 303 K. Figure 3c shows that A0 increases linearly with increasing γ1/2 for lovastatin
in various solvents at 303 K, where A0 and γ in each solvent are determined using the corresponding
induction time data fitted to eq 10. On the other hand, Figure 3d shows that no clear relationship is observed
between AJ and γ1/2 for
lovastatin in various solvents at 303 K, where AJ and γ in each solvent are determined using the corresponding
induction time data fitted to eq 9.

Figure 4a shows the measured supersaturation dependence of solution viscosity
for phenacetin in various solvents at 298 K, where Ceq for phenacetin in each solvent at 298 K is taken from
a report by Croker et al.21 (Ceq = 72 mg solute/g solvent for ethanol, Ceq = 24 mg solute/g solvent for ethyl acetate, and Ceq = 48 mg solute/g solvent for acetonitrile). Figure 4b shows the measured
induction time data fitted to eq 10 for phenacetin in various solvents at 298 K, where
the induction time data are experimentally obtained in this work for
various initial concentrations cooled to 298 K. Figure 4c shows that A0 increases linearly with increasing γ1/2 for phenacetin
in various solvents at 298 K, where A0 and γ in each solvent are determined using the corresponding
induction time data fitted to eq 10. On the other hand, Figure 4d shows that no clear relationship is observed
between AJ and γ1/2 for
phenacetin in various solvents at 298 K, where AJ and γ in each solvent are determined using the corresponding
induction time data fitted to eq 9.

at 298 K; (b) induction time data fitted to eq 10 at 298 K; (c) linear relationship between A0 and γ1/2 at 298 K; and (d) AJ vs γ1/2 at 298 K.

As shown in Figures 2a,3a, and 4a, the supersaturation dependence of solution viscosity in these
systems is nearly negligible because of the narrow concentration range
associated with the varied supersaturations. Table 4 lists the value of γ and the correlation
coefficient R2 for each line in Figures 2b, 3b, and 4b. The value of γ in
each solvent for these systems agrees with the reported literature
value.27,28 Note that the correlation coefficient in
each solvent for these systems exceeds the critical value of 0.900
for the 90% confidence interval and 4 points (i.e., degree of freedom
= 2).

Table 5 lists comparison between the correlation coefficient for each line
in Figures 2c, 3c, and 4c and the corresponding
critical value based on the 95% confidence interval. As the correlation
coefficient for these systems exceeds the corresponding critical value
based on the 95% confidence interval, it is concluded that A0 increases linearly with increasing γ1/2 in various solvents for each system. As an increasing trend
of the interfacial energy with the increasing corresponding solute–solvent
interaction for the same solute in various solvents has been reported
in the literature,15−18 it is speculated that the effect of this
interaction on γ is also strongly correlated with that on A0 for the same system. Consequently, if the
choice of solvent results in a greater γ because of a stronger
solute–solvent interaction, it simultaneously results in a
greater A0. On the other hand, if the
choice of solvent results in a smaller γ because of a weaker
solute–solvent interaction, it simultaneously results in a
smaller A0.

Conclusions
According to CNT,  is proposed in this work. Equation 10 is derived to investigate the nucleation
kinetics in various solvents using the induction time data for isonicotinamide,
lovastatin, and phenacetin. Although no clear relationship is observed
between AJ and γ1/2 among
various solvents for each system, A0 increases
linearly with increasing γ1/2 among various solvents
for each system, which is consistent with eq 6 derived based on CNT. Based on the analyzed
results of nucleation kinetics in these systems, it is proposed that AJ consists of two parts: the first part T/η is proportional to DAB, and the other part A0 is proportional
to γ1/2. Although AJ is
dependent on DAB among various solvents, A0 is not related to the dependence of DAB on T/η(T,S) among various solvents. It is speculated that
both γ and A0 are proportional to
the solute–solvent interaction for the corresponding solvent.

Experimental Section
The experimental
apparatus consists of a 250 mL crystallizer immersed in a programmable
thermostatic water bath shown in Figure 5. The crystallizer is equipped with a magnetic
stirrer at a constant stirring rate 350 rpm. The turbidity probe (Crystal
Eyes manufactured by HEL limited) is used to detect the nucleation
event during the induction time study.

Figure 5 Schematic diagram
of the experimental apparatus: (1) 250 mL crystallizer, (2) magnetic
stirrer, (3) constant temperature water bath, (4) turbidity probe,
(5) temperature probe, and (6) computer.

The induction times for
three crystallization systems, including isonicotinamide (Alfa Aesar,
purity 99%), lovastatin (Acros, purity 98%), and phenacetin (Acros,
purity 78%) are measured in this work. Analytical grade solvents (purity
99.9%) are used to prepare the supersaturated solution. In each experiment,
a 200 mL solution with the desired supersaturation is loaded into
the crystallizer. The solution is held at 3 °C above the saturated
temperature for 5–10 min to ensure a complete dissolution at
the beginning of the experiment, which is also confirmed by the turbidity
measurement. Then, the supersaturated solution is rapidly cooled to
the desired temperature for the induction time measurements.
