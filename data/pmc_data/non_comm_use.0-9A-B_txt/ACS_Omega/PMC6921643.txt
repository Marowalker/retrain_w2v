The structure and dynamics of itraconazole were investigated
by 13C 2DPASS MAS SSNMR and spin-lattice relaxation time
measurement
to get an insight into its multiple biological activities, e.g., antifungal,
antiviral, anticancer activities, etc. The molecular correlation time
at chemically different sites of carbon nuclei was calculated by considering
that the spin-lattice relaxation mechanism is mainly dominated by
chemical shift anisotropy interaction and heteronuclear dipole–dipole
interaction. The spin-lattice relaxation time is long for C35, C6,
C5, and C34 carbon nuclei that participated in the 1, 2, 4-triazole
ring. On the contrary, it is comparatively shorter for C1, C2, C3,
and C4 carbon nuclei associated with the sec-butyl
group in the triazolane side-chain region. Chemical shift anisotropy
(CSA) parameters of C5, C6, C34, and C35 nuclei are much higher than
those of C1, C2, C3, C4 nuclei, indicating that the relaxation mechanism
at a high value of magnetic field is predominated by chemical shift
anisotropy interaction. The molecular correlation time of carbon nuclei
residing at the side-chain region is 2–3 orders of magnitude
lesser than that of those participated in the 1,2,4-triazole ring.
The spin-lattice relaxation time is very long for carbon nuclei C28
and C30 bonded with chlorine. Asymmetry and anisotropy parameters
are also very high for the spinning CSA sideband pattern corresponding
to the C28 and C30 nuclei. The molecular correlation time is on the
order of 10–3 s for C28 and 10–4 s for C30, whereas for side-chain carbon nuclei, it is on the order
of 10–6 s. This suggests that the effective magnetic
field experienced by C28 and C30 nuclei is affected by the polarization
of the chemical bond. A huge variation in molecular correlation time
is observed for chemically different sites of carbon nuclei of the
itraconazole molecule. These investigations vividly portrayed how
the structure is correlated with the dynamics of a valuable drug,
itraconazole, with multiple biological activities. This study will
enlighten the way of inventing advance medicine for multiple biological
activities in the pharmaceutical industry.

1 Introduction
Itraconazole is a trizole-containing
drug prescribed for the prevention
and treatment of fungal infection.1 The
primary structural difference among itraconazole and other azole antifungals
is the presence of a triazolone ring (the ring consists of three nitrogens)
and a sec-butyl side chain, and these are responsible
for its different biological activities like antifungal and anticancer
activities, as well as its interesting pharmacokinetic behavior like
strong protein binding, tissue penetration, prolonged half-life and
bioavailability, etc.1,2 Nitrogen atoms of the azole ring
interact with the heme iron of the fungal cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A).
As a result, it inhibits the function of the lanosine 14α-demethylase
enzyme to stop the synthesis of ergosterol.3 It is the only drug in the azole class of antifungal agents that
inhibits the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and angiogenesis, responsible
for the anticancer activity.4 It is also
used for the treatment of dermatophyte infections, sporotrichosis,
penicilliosis, allergic and invasive aspergillosis, histoplasmosis,
superficial candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, etc. Itraconazole
is a well-tolerated drug as the mammalian cytochrome P450 enzyme is
less affected even at a high concentration of the drug.3 Hence, the sterol and steroid pathways of the
human pituitary–adrenal–testicular axis are less affected
by itraconazole.5 It is a weak base (pKa
= 3.7). It can be ionized at a low pH. It is available as capsules,
intravenous preparations, and oral suspensions. However, it is insoluble
in water and dilute acid solutions. Therefore, it is difficult to
extract the information about the structure and dynamics of itraconazole
in the solution state.

The molecular structure of itraconazole
shares a striking similarity
with terconazole and ketoconazole. Although terconazole and ketoconazole
possess antifungal activity like itraconazole, but they fail to restrain
the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and
to persuade the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR
2) glycosylation defect.6 The range of
application of triazoles (itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole,
and posaconazole) is broader than that of ketoconazole (with an azole
ring associated with two nitrogens). Itraconazole can be used for
the medication of both superficial and systemic fungal infections.
A single drug with multiple biological activities is not so common,
and itraconazole is one of them. Hence, it is fascinating to investigate
the internal structure and spin dynamics of itraconazole to get an
insight into the varying dynamics in different parts of the structure
responsible for different biological and pharmacokinetic behaviors
(Figure 5a). The structural
details and molecular dynamics of this unique azole were investigated
by 13C CP-MAS NMR spectral analysis, 13C spin-lattice
relaxation time measurements, two-dimensional phase-adjusted spinning
sideband (2DPASS) magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) experiment, and calculation of molecular correlation time at
numerous carbon nuclei situated at various chemical environments.

Chemical shift anisotropy provides valuable information about the
molecular conformation and internal structure. There are various techniques
to determine CSA parameters. They can be measured by the two-dimensional
MAS/CSA NMR experiment7 and by SUPER (separation
of undistorted powder patterns by effortless recoupling) MAS NMR at
a magic-angle-spinning (MAS) of 2.5–5 kHz.8 ROCSA (recoupling of chemical shift anisotropy) pulse sequence
was applied to determine CSA parameters at MAS frequencies of 11–20
kHz.9 RNCSA (γ-encoded RNnν-symmetry-based chemical shift anisotropy) recoupling schemes were
applied to extract CSA parameters of the system with weak homonuclear
dipole–dipole interactions under a wide range of MAS frequencies.10 The two-dimensional magic-angle-flipping (2DMAF)
experiment,11−14 two-dimensional magic-angle-turning (2DMAT) experiment,15 and two-dimensional phase-adjusted spinning
sideband (2DPASS) magic-angle-spinning (MAS) SSNMR experiment16,17 can extract information about CSA for multiple site compounds at
very low MAS speed. The total evolution period in indirect dimension
for the 2DMAT experiment is not constant. Consequently, the spin–spin
relaxation mechanism makes the spectrum so complicated that it would
be difficult to extract the exact information about the relative abundance
of chemically different sites of carbon nuclei. Thus, a probe is required
for the 2DMAT experiment that can alter the orientation of the spinner
during each scan. This type of probe is not commercially available.
In these aspects, the two-dimensional phase-adjusted spinning sideband
(2DPASS) magic-angle-spinning (MAS) SSNMR technique is more feasible
as the total time during five π pulses remains constant, and
this experiment can be performed using a standard commercial probe.
This technique was employed to investigate the properties of glass
compounds18 and biopolymers,19−22 but it is not yet exploited properly to investigate the internal
structure and dynamic of such a valuable antifungal drug, itraconazole,
with several ancillary biological activities. This study will enlighten
the way of inventing advance medicine for fungal infections and design
of potent drugs.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 NMR Measurements
An active ingredient
of itraconazole, purchased from Sigma Aldrich, was used for solid-state
NMR experiments. 13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR experiments
were performed using a JEOL ECX 500 NMR spectrometer. The resonance
frequency for 13C was 125.721 MHz. All of the experiments
were carried out in a 3.2 mm JEOL double resonance MAS probe. The
magic-angle-spinning (MAS) speed was 10 kHz for 13C CP-MAS
spectrum and spin-lattice relaxation measurements. The condition of
cross-polarization (CP) was maintained by keeping contact time 2 ms,
and SPINAL-64 1H decoupling was used during acquisition.
The 13C spin-lattice relaxation experiment was conducted
using the Torchia CP method.23

2.2 CSA Measurements
During the slow
MAS speed, the powder pattern breaks into several numbers of sidebands.
The spacing among the sidebands is equal to the MAS speed. Using sideband
intensities of the spinning CSA sideband pattern, CSA parameters can
be measured by the Herzfeld and Berger24 integral method.

The pulse sequence of the 2DPASS MAS NMR
experiment with five π pulses was established by Antzutkin et
al. in 1995.17 The phase cycling for the
desired coherence pathway was done by 13 steps cogwheel phase cycling.
In the indirect dimension, data points were sixteen.17 The time evolution of five π pulses was calculated
by PASS equations. The 2DPASS experiments were performed at two different
values of spinning speed 600 and 2000 Hz. The CP condition for these
two spinning speeds was optimized on glycin with 2 ms contact time.
The 90° pulse length for 13C was 3 μs.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Spin-Lattice Relaxation Measurements
Figure 1a shows that
the itraconazole molecule is associated with three prominent regions:
triazole-containing dioxolane region, phenyl–piperazine–phenyl
linker region, and triazolone side-chain region. Although the phenyl–piperazine–phenyl
linker region and triazolone side-chain region are not playing prominent
roles in interaction with the heme group CYP51, they interact with
amino acid residues in the substrate access channel.25 The side-chain region can easily be replaced by various
functional groups like hydrazine carboxamides and meta-substituted
amides. The triazole-containing dioxolane region is responsible for
inhibition of CYP3A4 to thwart coordination of the molecular oxygen,
essential for oxidation.26,27 Stereochemical orientation
of the dioxolane ring plays a significant role in inhibition of the
hedgehog signaling pathway. The antifungal action is due to the binding
of the triazole nitrogen with cytochrome P45051(CYP51).28Figure 1b shows 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of itraconazole. Figure 2a–d shows 13C spin-lattice decay curves of various carbon nuclei situated
in chemically and crystallographically different environments. The
bar diagram of the spin-lattice relaxation time (as shown in Figure 2e) suggests that
the spin-lattice relaxation time hugely varied due to the change of
the chemical environment surrounding the nuclei. The spin-lattice
relaxation time (as shown in Table 1) is very long for C5, C6, C34, and C35 carbon nuclei
participated in the 1,2,4-triazole ring. Anisotropy parameters (Table 2) are also comparatively
large for these specific sites of carbon nuclei. On the contrary,
the relaxation time is shorter and CSA parameters are lower for C1,
C2, C3, and C4 carbon nuclei, residing in the side-chain region.

The spin-lattice relaxation time is very long for
carbon nuclei
C28 and C30 bonded with the chlorine atom. Asymmetry and anisotropy
parameters are also very high for the spinning CSA sideband pattern
corresponding to the C28 and C30 nuclei. This suggests that the relaxation
mechanism is greatly affected by chemical shift anisotropy interaction.
The role of chemical shift anisotropy in the spin-lattice relaxation
mechanism can be expressed as29−31 1  where correlation time τc = 3 τ2, B is the applied magnetic
field, S2 = (Δδ)2 (1 + η2/3), and , .

3.2 Chemical Shift Anisotropy
Both isotropic
and anisotropic components of the chemical shift are correlated with
chemical bonding. The anisotropic component of chemical shift depends
on the orientation and conformation of the molecule. Chemical shift
anisotropy can be represented by a second-rank tensor with nine components.
In the principal axis system (PAS), off-diagonal components are cancel
out and three diagonal terms survive. The expressions of these diagonal
components of the chemical shift anisotropy tensor (δ11, δ22, and δ33) are given by32,33 2   3   4  where Lx, Ly, and Lz represent the components
of angular momentum along x, y,
and z directions, respectively. The first part of
these three equations generates from those electrons that constitute
spherically symmetric charge distribution. There arise distortions
in this spherically symmetric charge distribution, when electrons
are lifted to the excited state from the ground state. The second
term mainly arises for those electrons that reside in the p or d orbital.

The center of gravity of the spinning CSA sideband pattern is represented
as an isotropic chemical shift .24,31,34 Changes in the isotropic chemical shift have a great influence on
the breadth of the CSA tensor. Generally, small changes in the isotropic
chemical shift correspond to a larger change in the chemical shift
anisotropy.35 Span (Ω = δ11 – δ33) represents the maximum width
of the spinning CSA sideband pattern. According to Haeberlen convention,
the anisotropy (Δδ) and asymmetry (η) parameters
are defined as  and , respectively. Anisotropy represents the
largest separation from the center of gravity of the spinning CSA
sideband pattern. The sign of the anisotropy tells on which side of
the center of gravity one can find the largest separation. When the
spinning CSA pattern is axially symmetric (i.e., δ22 is equal to δ11 or δ33), then
the value of the asymmetry parameter is zero. Hence, the asymmetry
parameter basically shows whether the CSA pattern deviates from its
axially symmetric shape or not. As shown in Table 2, the asymmetry parameter is small (<0.5)
for C1, C2, C4, C9, C11, C17, C18, C22, C23, C24, C25, C31, and C32
resonance lines, which indicates that the sideband patterns for these
resonance lines are axially symmetric. On the contrary, the sideband
patterns are highly asymmetric for these resonance lines for which
the asymmetry parameter is greater than 0.5, especially for C5, C19,
C22, C28, and C30 carbon resonance lines. The orientation of the asymmetry
is represented by a parameter referred to as “skew” . The position of δ22 with
respect to the center of gravity (δiso) of the spinning
CSA sideband pattern determines the sign of “skew”.
Skew is zero when δ22 coincides with δiso.

Figure 3 shows the 13C 2DPASS MAS NMR spectrum of itraconazole.
The direct dimension
and indirect dimension of the 2D spectrum represent, respectively,
the infinite spinning speed spectrum and the anisotropic spectrum.
The spinning CSA sideband patterns for chemically different carbon
sites are also shown in (a) C31, (b) C17, (c) C5, (d) C23, (e) C15,
and (f) C27. Table 2 shows that the values of CSA parameters are varied for numerous
carbon nuclei situated in different chemical environments. The values
of both chemical shift anisotropy parameter (Δδ) and the
spin-lattice relaxation time is shorter for carbon nuclei (C1, C2,
C3, and C4) associated with the sec-butyl group in
the triazolane side-chain region compared to other carbon nuclei.
The spinning CSA sideband patterns of C1 and C4 are axially symmetric
(η ≈ 0) and span of C1 and C4 is also very low. These
data suggest that the CSA parameters of the sec-butyl
(C1, C2, C3, and C4) group are greatly influenced by the side-chain
conformation and dynamics. On the other hand, anisotropy parameters
are very high for carbon nuclei (C35, C6, C5, and C34) situated between
two heteroatoms in a five-membered 1,2,4-triazole ring due to the
strong deshielding effect. Magnetic shielding and deshielding effects
arise due to the existence of the nonbonded electron, which manifest
as a large value of anisotropy.36 The electrons
revolving along the clockwise direction can generate a magnetic field,
which is along the direction of the external magnetic field (paramagnetic
current). Consequently, the magnitude of the resultant magnetic field
is increased—the deshielding effect. On the contrary, electrons
revolving along the counterclockwise direction can generate a magnetic
field along the opposite direction of the external magnetic field
(diamagnetic current). Hence, the resultant magnetic field is decreased—the
shielding effect. As a consequence, the values of magnetic susceptibilities  are not the same along the three directions
in the principal axis system. Moreover, there exist two components
of magnetic susceptibilities—one parallel to the magnetic field  and another perpendicular to the magnetic
field .38 The magnetic
anisotropy in terms of these parallel and perpendicular components
of magnetic susceptibilities can be represented by the McConnell equation37 5  where θ1 is the angle between
the radius vector and x-axis and θ2 is the angle between the radius vector and z-axis.
This anisotropic magnetic susceptibility gives rise to the direction-dependent
magnetic field. Magnetic shielding/deshielding effect and electrostatic
effect are the reasons behind the large value of anisotropy for carbon
nuclei surrounded by nonspherical distribution of charges.

The stereochemical orientation of the dioxolane
ring (C24, C25,
and C26 reside on that ring) plays a significant role in Hh-pathway
inhibition and compound stability. For carbon nuclei in the dioxolane
ring, the CSA parameters are not as high as those of the carbon nuclei
associated with the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring.

itraconazole.

The electrostatic interaction of a specific molecule
with the surrounding
molecule generates polarization on the electron density. This polarization
particularly influences the strength of the induced magnetic field.
As a result, the induced magnetic field is different along different
directions.38 As shown in Figure 4, the CSA parameters of C28
and C30 nuclei bonded with a chlorine atom are also high because the
effective magnetic field experienced by these nuclei is influenced
by the polarization of the chemical bond with which those atoms are
attached. The spin-lattice relaxation time is also very long for these
nuclei. Even the CSA parameters are also very high for those nuclei
(C27, C29, C31, and C32) that reside near the polar bonds because
the neighboring polar bonds also polarize the electron cloud surrounding
C27, C29, C31, and C32 nuclei. As a result, the local shielding or
deshielding become direction-dependent—that means the local
field experienced by nuclei may increase in a certain direction or
decrease in other directions.39 The effect
of the electrostatic polarization of bonds on the shielding tensor
is portrayed by this measurement.

3.3 Molecular Correlation Time
Heteronuclear
dipole–dipole coupling and chemical shift anisotropy interaction
play a pivotal role in the relaxation mechanism of 13C
nuclei. The role of the chemical shift anisotropy in the relaxation
mechanism is expressed in eq 1. The contribution of heteronuclear dipole–dipole coupling
to the relaxation mechanism can be expressed as29 6  By keeping only the first term 7  where X represents 1H, 35Cl, and 14N. The bond distance rCX is represented in Table 4. The Larmor precession frequency (ω) = 2πf= 2 × 3.14 × 125.758 MHz =
789.76024 MHz; B = 11.74T, γC = 10.7084 MHz/T, γH = 42.577
MHz/T, γN = 3.077 MHz/T, and ℏ = 1.054 × 10–34 Js. The crystal
structure of itraconazole was collected from the reported structural
data.40 The hydrogen atoms were added into
the structure. The final structure was optimized using the Hartre–Fock
method with the 6–31G (d,p) basis set. In this process, hydrogens
in the structure were only optimized by keeping all other atoms frozen
as reported earlier.41 The bond distances
were derived from the final optimized structure of itraconazole. The
whole calculation was performed using the Gaussian 09 package.42

The spin-lattice relaxation rate for 13C can be written as 8  The relaxation mechanism of nonprotonated
carbon nuclei is predominated by chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) in
the presence of a high value of magnetic field.30 The molecular correlation time of the itraconazole molecule
is calculated using eq 8

Table 3 shows
the
molecular correlation time of numerous carbon nuclei situated in different
chemical environments of itraconazole. It varies in the range of 10–3–10–6 s. It is clear from Tables 1–3 that the spin-lattice relaxation rate, CSA parameters,
and molecular correlation time hugely varied for the same carbon nuclei
placed in different electronic surroundings and numerous molecular
conformations. From Figure 5 and Table 3, it is clear that the molecular correlation time of C1, C2,
C3, and C4 carbon nuclei is 2–3 orders of magnitude lesser
than that of C5, C6, C34, and C35. The molecular correlation time
of the carbon nuclei attached with a chlorine atom is on the order
of 10–3 s for C28 and 10–4 s for
C30. For side-chain carbon nuclei, the molecular correlation time
is on the order of 10–6 s. The spin-lattice relaxation
times of C6, C20, C23, C24, and C26 carbon nuclei linked with an oxygen
atom are also significantly long. CSA parameters are high for C6 and
C20 nuclei. The molecular correlation times for C6, C20, and C23 nuclei
are on the order of 10–4 s and for C24, C25, and
C26 nuclei on the order of 10–5 s.

Perhaps, these substantial variations of CSA parameters
and degrees
of motion at different regions of this molecule are responsible for
its different biological activities like antifungal and anticancer
activities, as well as interesting pharmacokinetic behavior like strong
protein binding, tissue penetration, and prolonged half-life and bioavailability.
In essence, the influences of the local environment on the structure
and dynamics of the itraconazole molecule are vividly portrayed by
this type of investigation.

4 Conclusions
Extraction of CSA parameters
by the 13C 2DPASS MAS NMR
experiment, determination of spin-lattice relaxation time by the Torchia
CP method, and calculation of molecular correlation time at 35 crystallographically
and chemically different sites of carbon nuclei of itraconazole provide
the information about the correlation between the structure and dynamics
of this valuable antifungal drug. Substantial difference in the spin-lattice
relaxation time (shown in Figure 2e), CSA parameters (as shown in Table 2 and Figure 4), and molecular correlation time (as shown in Table 3 and Figure 5b) is observed for different structural parts of this molecule.
The spin-lattice relaxation time is long for carbon nuclei (C35, C6,
C5, and C34) that participated in the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring. On the
contrary, the spin lattice relaxation time is comparatively short
for C1, C2, C3, and C4 carbon nuclei that reside at the side-chain
region. CSA parameters of C5, C6, C34, and C35 nuclei are much higher
than those of C1, C2, C3, and C4 nuclei, indicating that the relaxation
mechanism at a high value of magnetic field is predominated by chemical
shift anisotropy interaction. The molecular correlation time of C1,
C2, C3, and C4 regions is 2–3 orders of magnitude lesser than
that of C5, C6, C34, and C35. The spin-lattice relaxation time is
very long for carbon nuclei C28 and C30 bonded with chlorine. Asymmetry
and anisotropy parameters are also very high of the spinning CSA sideband
pattern corresponding to the C28 and C30 nuclei. The molecular correlation
time is on the order of 10–3 s for C28 and 10–4 s for C30, whereas for the sec-butyl
group carbon nuclei, the molecular correlation time is on the order
of 10–6 s. It may be possible that a molecule with
different degrees of motions in its structure, like itraconazole,
is capable of producing many biological activities by interacting
with the enzyme/proteins of different structures and dynamics. This
type of investigation will elucidate the way of inventing advanced
medicine with multiple biological activities in the pharmaceutical
industry.
