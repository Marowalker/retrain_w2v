Even
though lithium–sulfur batteries possess higher theoretical
capacity and energy density than conventional lithium-ion batteries,
the challenging issues such as poor electronic conductivity of sulfur,
dendrite formation and subsequent polysulfide shuttling, and the undesirable
interfacial properties of the lithium metal anode with an electrolyte
impede this system from commercialization. To circumvent the dissolution
of lithium polysulfides and to improve the interfacial properties
of the electrolyte with the lithium metal anode, numerous tactics
have been employed. Therefore, in this work, hybrid electrolytes composed
of room-temperature ionic liquids of different cations with the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(TFSI) anion and a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte [1 M LiTFSI in tetraethylene
glycol dimethyl ether/1,3-dioxolane 1:1 (v/v)] have been prepared,
and their physicoelectrochemical properties were thoroughly investigated.
The lithium surface upon cycling was characterized by Raman, Fourier
transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses.
The dendrite and shuttle current measurements also indicated the formation
of a stable solid electrolyte interphase and lower polysulfide shuttling
between the electrodes. Among the systems examined, the hybrid electrolyte
composed of 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium TFSI exhibited appreciable
charge–discharge characteristics, better interfacial properties
with the lithium metal anode, and increased ionic conductivity which
were attributed to the enhanced ion-pair interaction that is present
between the 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium cation and the TFSI anion
in the electrolyte which was substantiated by Raman analysis.

==== Body
Introduction
Although the mechanism of the first lithium–sulfur
battery
system was introduced by Ulam and Herbert in 1962, its technological
importance was recognized only two decades ago. The unique properties
such as the high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1672 mA h g–1), environment-friendliness, low cost, and so forth have identified
lithium–sulfur batteries as a promising candidate for energy
storage and conversion.1−4 Unfortunately, the low conductivity of sulfur, dissolution and polysulfide
shuttling between the electrodes, and the poor electrode/electrolyte
interfacial properties of the lithium metal anode with nonaqueous
liquid electrolytes impede this system from practical applications.4 However, enormous attempts have been made to
address these challenges around the world.5 The conductivity of sulfur was appreciably increased by wrapping
elemental sulfur in carbon nanotubes6 and
conducting polymers6 and incorporating
solid additives such as MgAl2O4,7 metal organic frameworks,8,9 and so forth.
However, the performance of Li–S batteries continues to suffer
from low Coulombic efficiency and capacity fade because of the low
utilization of elemental sulfur which arises from the dissolution
of Li2Sm when the system is
in conjunction with a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte. The most commonly
used electrolyte is a combination of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl
ether (TEGDME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) containing approximately 1
M Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) with LiNO3 as an additive. To overcome the shuttling of lithium polysulfides
as intermediates of the discharged products, attempts have been made
to replace the nonaqueous liquid electrolytes with solid10 and gel polymer electrolytes.11 Superionic conductors have also been employed as solid
electrolytes for lithium–sulfur12 and for Li-ion batteries with LiFePO4 cathode materials.13,14 Although the migration of Li2Sm was effectively suppressed by the solid electrolytes, the
poor solid electrolyte/solid electrode interfacial properties and
low diffusion of Li+ ions restrict the rate capability
of the Li–S system.15,16 Therefore, designing
of the liquid electrolyte with a potentially lower solubility of discharge
species (S8 to Li2Sx) is an effective way to enhance the performance of Li–S batteries.

Generally, the ether-based electrolytes selectively coordinate
with the Li+ Lewis acidic cation and have a high donor
number. This offers an improved solubility to lithium polysulfide
and provides an adequate concentration of redox sulfur species.17 Among the different organic solvents, DOL has
a high stability toward lithium anode by passively creating a solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of lithium and also
better polysulfide solubility.18 As a result,
this mixture (TEGDME + DOL) can provide sufficient specific discharge
capacity and longer cycle life at a high C rate. Nevertheless, DOL
is easily prone to degradation by small amounts of contaminants in
addition to polysulfide shuttling.

Ionic liquids (ILs) made
of only ions have been identified as a
possible replacement to highly inflammable organic solvents. The advantages
of ILs include negligibly low volatility, relatively less flammability,
high thermal stability, wide electrochemical stability, and better
safety. However, the properties of ILs are mainly determined by their
ionic nature. According to Cairns and Shin, ILs for lithium battery
applications are employed in different formulations: IL–lithium
salt as binary electrolytes,19 IL–lithium
salt with a polymer as gel electrolytes,20 and IL–lithium salt with an organic solvent as ternary mixtures/hybrid
electrolytes.21 Watanebe et al.22 quantitatively estimated the dependence of the
ionic structure, the polarity, the physicochemical properties, and
the degree of ionic nature of different ILs. The lithium polysulfide
diffusion and migration are mainly influenced by the physicochemical
nature of the electrolytes.23 The same
group has identified N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl) ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide
as an alternative electrolyte for the lithium–sulfur batteries
in which lithium polysulfide was significantly suppressed.24 Earlier reports clearly demonstrated the solubility
and mobility of Li2Sx which
can be successfully controlled by PP13TFSI by the weak Lewis acidic/basic
coordination of Li+-cation,25 thereby suppressing the growth of lithium deposition. In a similar
way, N-methyl-(n-butyl)pyrrolidinium
TFSI also offers a high operating voltage though it suffers from poor
conductivity because of its viscous nature. On the contrary, trialkylammonium-based
ILs showed high ionic conductivity. Considering these properties,
in the present work, a series of hybrid electrolytes composed of commonly
used liquid electrolytes [comprising 1 M LiTFSI in a combination of
TEGDME and DOL of 1:1 (v/v) as solvents] and ILs of different cations
for different volume ratios were prepared, and their electrochemical
and interfacial properties were thoroughly investigated.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a–f
illustrates the molecular/chemical structures of 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium
TFSI (BMP), 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium TFSI (MPP), triethylsulfonium
TFSI (TES), LiTFSI, TEGDME, and DOL. Generally, the large sizes of
the solvent molecules and the high viscosity of room temperature ILs
(RTILs) are considered as favorable properties to avoid polysulfide
diffusion.

Figure 1 Structural formula of the IL and organic solvents.

Ionic Conductivity and Compatibility Studies
The dependence
of ionic conductivity on the inverse of temperature for IL-LiTFSI
and their hybrid electrolytes is displayed in Figure 2a–c. It is observed from Figure 2a,b that the conventional
nonaqueous electrolyte exhibited the lowest ionic conductivity. Upon
the addition of BMP and MPP, the conductivity is increased. Maximum
ionic conductivity was achieved when the content of e tbare electrolyte/IL
was of the ratio of 3:1. Generally, the addition of IL will reduce
the values of ionic conductivity because of the increase in viscosity
of the hybrid solution. A similar trend was observed by Shin and Cairns.26 On the contrary, in the present study, in Figure 2c, there is no increase
in conductivity when the composition was changed from TES-3 to TES-4,
which is attributed to the different ion aggregation behavior responsible
for the discrepancies between the IL solvent conductivity and viscosity,
as discussed by Fox et al.27 The reduction
in conductivity in TES-containing ILs could be attributed to the steric
hindrance offered by the branched structure of the cation which leads
to a sluggish mass transport.

Figure 2 Ionic conductivity studies of the electrolytes,
viz., bare, IL-1
to IL-4 containing (a) BMP (b) MPP, and (c) TES with the lithium metal
at RT.

Generally, the enhanced cycling
performance of a Li–S cell
with IL is attributed to the low solubility of polysulfide in IL.
However, the passivating film formed on the lithium metal also contributes
crucially to the determination of the charge–discharge behavior
of the lithium–sulfur cells. To evaluate the interfacial properties
of the lithium metal, symmetric cells with different electrolytes
were fabricated, and their interfacial resistance (Ri) was measured as a function of time and displayed in Figure 3. The value of Ri can be generally obtained from the Nyquist
plots. The parallel combination of resistance (Rfilm) and capacitance associated with the passivating film
on the Li electrode is represented by large semicircles. The small
semicircle is attributed to the double-layer capacitance in parallel
with the charge-transfer resistance. Interestingly, the intercept
of the large semicircle at high frequency on the real Z-axis is presumably associated with the Ri value of the lithium surface with the electrolyte system. It can
be clearly seen from Figure 3 that for a symmetric cell with BMP and TES, the value of Ri increases with the increase of time, which
is presumably because of the formation of a resistive precipitation
layer on the lithium anode.23 However,
in the case of IL 2, IL 3, and IL 4 (hybrid electrolytes), the value
of Ri was found to be lower and is attributed
to the cation–TFSI interaction with the electrolyte, which
helps to form a dense SEI layer with a thickness of a few micrometers,
which prevents the direct contact between the polysulfides and the
lithium metal. It is found that the ILs alone exhibited the highest
interfacial resistance because of their increased tendency to form
a passivation layer compared to that of alkyl carbonates. These results
are in accordance with the work by Katayama et al.,28 wherein PEGDME was employed as a solvent to reduce the
interfacial resistance compared to pure ILs.

IL-4 containing (a) BMP (b) TES, and (c) MPP cations with the lithium
metal at RT.

Surface Morphology
Figure 4a shows the
digital photographs of the lithium
surface viewed from an optical microscope, which were exposed to a
conventional nonaqueous liquid electrolyte (bare) and electrolytes
comprising BMP-4, MPP-4, and TES-4 (as the hybrid electrolyte composed
of IL-4 composition exhibited the maximum ionic conductivity, these
systems were used for further characterization). Figure 4a shows a rough morphology
on the lithium surface when the lithium metal was exposed to a conventional
electrolyte and a hybrid electrolyte comprising MPP-4. However, the
lithium surface is not much altered by the hybrid electrolytes comprising
BMP-4 and TES-4. The scanning electron microscopy images (Figure 4b) show the surface
morphology of the lithium metal exposed to a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte
and a hybrid electrolyte (IL-4) comprising BMP, MPP, and TES. The
lithium surface shows a rough surface with the formation of island
structures, irrespective of the electrolytes used; however, the size
of islands varied from 5 to 10 μm and is attributed to the corrosion
of the lithium metal anode by IL moieties.29

as viewed through (a) optical microscope and (b) scanning electron
microscope.

To further analyze the
chemical composition of the passivating
film formed on the lithium metal surface, Raman, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses
were employed for the lithium surface exposed to the bare electrolyte
and the hybrid electrolytes containing ILs.30

Raman Analysis
Vibrational spectroscopy has been employed
in the present study to understand the structural properties and interactions
present in ILs, irrespective of their physical characteristics.31 Raman spectra give information on the conformational
or structural changes of the chemical structures. In a typical electrolyte
system, the anion bands usually dominate because of their vibrations
arising from the polarizability fluctuation.32 Raman spectroscopy reveals the coexistence of the cisoid and transoid
conformers of [NTf2]− in normal ILs.
The lithium metal surface which is in contact with the hybrid electrolyte
(IL-4) was studied, as it exhibited the highest ionic conductivity.
For all of the modes associated with the TFSI– anion,
the intensity relative to the MPP+ cation was found to
increase upon the addition of LiTFSI to the MPP IL. The strongest
band of the TFSI anion at 742 cm–1 was ascribed
to the bending of CF3 in the SCF3 groups.33 Interestingly, the peaks corresponding to the
expansion and contraction of the bulky TFSI anion occur, and these
vibrational modes induce an adverse change in the polarizability,
and the corresponding energy associated with this is intensely affected
by the anion coordination.33

In accordance
to an earlier report,34 the Raman spectrum
of BMP depicted in Figure 5 shows two closely positioned bands which are ascribed to
the vibrational motion of TFSI– in the region of
380–450 cm–1. The one strong, sharp line
at 740 cm–1 in the fingerprint region is distinctive
for the TFSI anion, and the peak corresponds to the S–N and
C–F stretching coupled with the SO2 wagging motion.
In addition, the fingerprint region also consists of relatively weak
peaks observed at 558, 557, 713, 1135, 1237, and 1445 cm–1. The peaks at 1135 and 1237 cm–1 are respectively
attributed to the C–F stretching and C–F symmetric bending
in the TFSI anion.29 A strong peak at 740
cm–1 is observed in the Raman spectra of TES, indicative
of the presence of the TFSI– group.32

Figure 5 Raman analysis of the lithium surface exposed to bare electrolyte
and IL-4 hybrid electrolytes containing BMP, MPP, and TES ILs.

Except the bare electrolyte (nonaqueous
electrolyte without IL),
in all the other cases, a very intense band at 741 cm–1 (indicated with *) is observed which is assigned to the cisoid and
transoid conformers of TFSI–. It is noteworthy that
this band is very sensitive to small cation coordination (e.g., Li+). In all these cases, typical cation and anion vibrational
bands are observed. It is found that among the three hybrid IL-4 electrolytes,
MPP-4 exhibits the less intense peak at 741 cm–1, which indicates a strong ion-pair interaction between the MPP cation
and the TFSI anion, thereby enhancing the mobility of Li+ ions.

FTIR Analysis
As demonstrated by Fumino and Ludwig,35 infrared spectroscopy is an apt method for analyzing
the interaction between cations and anions in ILs. In the present
work, the surface of the lithium metal in contact with the bare and
hybrid electrolytes (IL-4) is analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy between
4000 and 400 cm–1 in attenuated total reflectance
(ATR) mode, and the results are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 FTIR analysis of the lithium surface upon contact
with the bare
and IL-4 hybrid electrolytes containing BMP, MPP, and TES ILs.

Figure 6 shows the
IR spectra of the mixture of the DOL, TEGDME, and LiTFSI electrolytes
with BMP, MPP, and TES ILs. It is found that C–F, C–S,
and S–O stretching appeared at 939 cm–1.
Although this band is clearly visible in the IL–electrolyte
mixture, its absence in the bare electrolyte indicates a very low
concentration of the TFSI anion. Similarly, S=O stretching
appeared as a sharp band at 1124–36 cm–1 in
the IL–electrolyte mixture, whereas the same appeared as a
very weak and broad band in the bare non aqueous electrolyte. The
bands between 2800 and 2900 cm–1 are assigned to
C–H stretching. The distinctive carbonyl absorption appeared
at 1732 cm–1 approximately, and it corresponds to
the carbonyl group present in DOL. In the case of IL–electrolyte
mixtures, the N+–C (quaternary N–C) band
and the C–H bending band in the cations appeared at 1465 cm–1, whereas this is absent in the bare nonaqueous electrolyte,
indicating the absence of quaternary structures. The bands at 493
and 615 cm–1 (approximately) are assigned to the cis and trans TFSI anions. Upon the addition
of IL to the electrolyte, slight changes in the peak shifts were observed
accompanied by peak broadening. This clearly indicates the interaction
between the IL and the nonaqueous electrolyte.

It is noteworthy
that the cis-TFSI conformation
exhibits a clear shoulder peak around 520 cm–1 and
intense absorption lines located at 585, 603, and 654 cm–1. Quite the opposite way, trans-TFSI shows two intense
vibration modes located around 581 and 625 cm–1.
The FTIR spectra in Figure 6 show that although the bare electrolyte contains LiTFSI salt,
it does not show any such peak, whereas all these modes are detected
in the spectra, thus demonstrating the presence of both conformers
in the liquid phase of all ILs.

Dendrite Studies
The SEI layer, a polycrystalline film,
is mainly formed because of the decomposition products arising from
the nonaqueous liquid electrolyte, densely packed inorganic compounds,
and aggregated organic compounds on reaction with the Li metal. The
thickness of the SEI layer varies from a few nanometers to tens of
nanometers and is sensitive to chemical conditions; though it is insulating
in nature, it is ionically conducting. It also serves as a protective
barrier in screening the bulk electrolyte from the strongly reducing
lithium metal anode. To get a better insight into the SEI phenomena
and dendrite formation, a closer understanding of the lithium dissolution
kinetics, which represents the discharge (stripping) and deposition
kinetics congruent to the charging process, is required. As this can
be quantified by an overpotential, a simple tool to probe the formation
of dendrites in a lithium metal anode when in conjugation with a liquid
electrolyte under constant current cycling experiments was employed
as proposed by Bieker et al.36 In the present
work, a symmetric cell composed of Li/Li was used to eliminate the
effects from a nonlithium electrode.

In Figure 7a,b, the positive and negative potentials,
respectively, denote the dissolution and deposition of the lithium
working electrode (WE) against the Li/Li symmetric cells. The positive
and negative overpotentials significantly reduce after five cycles
of deposition and dissolution of lithium at the WE. As seen from Figure 7a, the apparent initial
high overpotentials of lithium dissolution on the lithium surface
is attributed to the smooth and less surface area of fresh lithium.
Further, the overpotential remains constant even after prolonged cycling,
which confirms that the dissolution of lithium is stable in an already
roughened lithium surface with a robust SEI.

Figure 7 (a) Evolution of overpotential
curves during successive lithium
plating/stripping in a Li/Li symmetrical cell with Li WE containing
an IL-4 hybrid electrolyte at a constant current density (j = 0.1 mA cm–2). (b) Selected overpotential
traces of subsequent lithium plating/stripping processes in a symmetrical
cell with lithium WE containing an IL-4 hybrid electrolyte at a constant
current density (j = 0.1 mA cm–2).

An initial maximum overpotential
of 0.105 mV was observed in a
symmetric cell with the MPP-based electrolyte compared to the BMP
(0.080 mV)- and TES (0.082 mV)-based electrolytes. This can be attributed
to the kinetic hindrance for the deposition of lithium over the electrode
surface (smooth and low surface area) as explained in Figure 7a.

Apparently, as seen
from Figure 7b, after
400 h of continuous stripping and deposition,
the positive overpotential was found to be +0.0176 mV for all the
three systems, viz., BMP, TES, and MPP. However, MPP was found to
have a negative overpotential of −0.0161 mV, whereas the symmetric
cell with both BMP and TES had −0.0175 mV. The marginal reduction
in the negative overpotentials of the cell with MPP indicates a general
decrease of the overall resistance toward lithium deposition.

Charge–Discharge
Studies
Figure 8a illustrates the galvanostatic first charge–discharge
profiles of Li–S cells with ILs and hybrid electrolytes of
different cations/anions at a rate of 0.1 C at 25 °C. The discharge
capacity as a function of cycle number is also displayed in Figure 8b–e. It is
apparent from Figure 8 that the anionic structure of an IL has a major influence on the
cycling performance. The cells with IL + 1 M LiTFSI show a single
voltage plateau at 2.1 V, approximately. However the discharge capacity
was reduced very rapidly within 50 cycles (Figure 8b).

Figure 8 (a) Galvanostatic first charge–discharge
profiles of Li–S
cells with an IL and hybrid electrolytes of different cations/anions
at a rate of 0.1 C at 25 °C. Discharge capacity vs cycle number
of the Li–S cells with (b) IL, (c) MPP-4, (d) BMP-4, and (e)
TES-4 hybrid electrolytes.

On the other hand, the IL-4 hybrid electrolytes exhibited
two voltage
plateaus during discharging (2.1 and 2.3 V) and a single plateau (2.3
V) during charging. It is clear from the discharge curves that the
first reduction voltage corresponds to the conversion of S8 to longer order Li2S8 (m >
4), whereas the reduction of Li2Sm to Li2S is represented by the lower voltage. It
is also apparent from Figure 8a that the first reduction voltage of the Li–S cell
containing bare electrolytes is slightly higher than that of IL/IL-4
containing hybrid electrolytes. This is ascribed to the solvent effect
associated with the less solubility of Li2Sm.24,37 These insoluble intermediates,
Li2Sm, as solids will get deposited
inside the composite sulfur cathode. The Li–S cell with the
hybrid electrolyte comprising MPP-4 exhibited a high overpotential,
and it also delivered a discharge capacity of 300 mA h g–1 on its first cycle which is much lower than that of the Li–S
cell with other hybrid electrolytes. Although the solubility of Li2Sx is very low in ILs, the transport
properties of the hybrid electrolytes are shown to have an influence
on the charge–discharge behavior of these systems. The ionic
conductivity of MPP and its hybrid is high compared to TES and BMP.
The charge–discharge behavior of ILs is even worse than that
of the hybrid electrolytes, and only 50 cycles could be achieved.
Among the three hybrid electrolytes, the Li–S cell with MPP-4
exhibited the maximum discharge capacity on its first cycle (1346
mA h g–1) and the 50th cycle (398 mA h g–1). In a similar way, the Li–S cells with BMP-4 and TES-4 exhibited
301 and 1237 mA h g–1 on their first cycles, respectively.
However, the discharge capacity reduced rapidly for the Li–S
cells with BMP-4 and TES-4 as electrolytes. The IL-4 hybrid electrolyte
containing MPP has a balance between the solubility of polysulfides
and the diffusion rate. MPP offers a wide electrochemical range,21 and the weak coordination of the Lewis acid
and base pairs in the MPP-containing electrolyte alleviates lithium
polysulfide solubility. In addition, MPP is less viscous (10.3 cP
at 25 °C) compared to the others and has the potential to suppress
the lithium polysulfide diffusion rate appreciably as evidenced by
the shuttle current measurement (as discussed in the following section).

Shuttle Current Estimation
One of the crucial parameters
for capacity fade in Li–S cells is associated with the shuttling
process. The insight into the differences in the shuttling process
observed with various IL-based hybrid electrolytes was determined
by shuttle current estimation, as proposed by Moy et al.38 In general, the open-circuit potential of the
anode is relatively constant and depends on the concentration of lithium
ions in the electrolyte and the accessibility of metallic lithium
on the anode. However, the potential of the cathode steadily decreases
because of the arrival of lower order polysulfides continuously at
the cathode from the anode by the shuttling phenomenon. In this experiment,
the cathode potential is maintained as constant by the application
of an external current which is proportional to the diffusional fluxes
of the polysulfides in the electrolyte across the electrodes. Hence,
the shuttle current can be quantified by forcing the electrode potential
to a constant value and measuring the response via the steady-state
current through the cell.

The linear region can be fit by a
straight line equation of the form (1). 1  where the
slope of the equation denoted by m quantitatively
represents the rate of decrease of the
shuttle current. Here, y represents the current and C denotes the y-intercept. Usually, a linear
decay in shuttle current is observed for all lithium–sulfur
cells.

As it was shown previously,38 the decay
in shuttle current sheds information on the amount of polysulfide
reduced to insoluble lower order polysulfide at the lithium metal
surface. Therefore, prevention of the deposition of lower order species
at the anode is expected to decrease the capacity fade in Li–S
cells, via its effects on decreasing the slope of the shuttle current. Figure 9 displays the shuttle
current versus time plot for the lithium–sulfur cell with the
hybrid electrolyte IL-4. It is found that the trend in shuttle current
is TES > BMP > MPP, which implies that the electrolyte containing
MPP exhibits lesser shuttling current compared to the Li–S
cell with BMP and TES in the electrolyte.

Figure 9 Shuttle current measurement
of Li–S cells with various hybrid
electrolytes (IL-4).

XPS Analysis of Electrode/Electrolyte Interface
In
the present work, lithium metal post contact with the bare and MPP-4
electrolytes was analyzed by XPS, as it shows the highest ionic conductivity
and discharge capacity among the systems studied. A detailed investigation
of the lithium surface post contact with the nonaqueous electrolyte
with and without MPP has been carried out.

Figure 10a,b shows the deconvoluted
XPS spectra of the C 1s, F 1s, Li 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and S 2p peaks obtained
from the lithium surface when in contact with the bare electrolyte
and MPP-containing hybrid electrolyte for 24 h. The F 1s peak at 684.8
and 688.6 eV, respectively, corresponds to LiF and −CF3 of the LiTFSI salt or its decomposition product.39 The deconvoluted XPS spectrum of S 2p shows
S–O bands at 168.5 and 167 eV which are ascribed to −SO2CF3 or LixSOy from the LiTFSI salt or its decomposition product,
respectively. The peaks between 164 and 165 eV correspond to S–S
bonds,40 and similarly the peaks between
160 and 162.9 eV indicate the presence of Li2S or the Li2S–SO3 complex. The peak at 399.5 eV in the
N 1s spectra corresponds to the imide groups of LiTFSI salt [N+].30 The C 1s peaks at 284.8 eV
(peak A) and 286.5 eV (peak B) are respectively assigned to the R3COLi–(CH2) and R3CO–R–
groups which is due to the solvent residues and decomposition products
(alcholates) or aliphatic carbons. While quantitatively analyzing
the C 1s peaks, peaks A and B cover an area of 15 955 and 7260
(a.u.), respectively, for the lithium metal in contact with the bare
electrolyte, whereas in the case of the lithium metal in contact with
the hybrid electrolyte, the area is 9809 and 1092 (a.u.).41 This indicates that the amount of decomposition
products deposited on the lithium metal in contact with the bare electrolyte
is more than that of the surface in contact with the hybrid electrolyte
with MPP-4, which is a direct indication that MPP helps in the formation
of a stable and thin SEI on the lithium surface.

lithium metal surface in contact with the
bare electrolyte for 24 h. (b) XPS spectra of the lithium metal surface

Conclusions
Although the nonaqueous
electrolyte composed of 1 M LiTFSI in a
combination of TEGDME and DOL (1:1 v/v) has been widely used, the
polysulfide shuttling and SEI on lithium are the challenging issues.
In the present work, the role of different cations of ILs to overcome
these challenges was systematically investigated. A series of hybrid
electrolytes composed of the aforementioned liquid electrolyte and
ILs of different cations, viz., BMP, MPP, and TES were prepared, and
their ionic conductivity and compatibility with the lithium metal
anode were also analyzed. It is found that the solvent–IL interaction
influences the ionic conductivity and the SEI film thickness. The
Raman and FTIR studies of the lithium surface in contact with the
bare and hybrid electrolytes confirmed the presence of both conformers
(cis and trans) in the liquid phase of all hybrid electrolytes (IL-4).
Among the three cations investigated, the MPP-4 hybrid electrolyte
showed an enhanced cycling performance which was attributed to the
suppression of dendrite formation, polysulfide shuttling, and SEI
growth, as evidenced by the dendrite, shuttle current, and XPS analyses.

Experimental
Procedure
Preparation of Hybrid Electrolytes
RTILs, namely, BMP,
MPP, and TES (TCI, Japan) were used as received. The conventionally
used nonaqueous electrolyte in lithium–sulfur cells composed
of 1 M lithium TFSI LiN(CF3SO2)2 in
a combination of DOL and TEGDME 1:1 (v/v) was prepared in an argon
atmosphere. The hybrid electrolytes were prepared by mixing ILs, namely,
BMP, MPP, and TES separately, and the nonaqueous electrolytes for
different volume ratios, viz., 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1, as shown in Table 1 are labeled accordingly.
All the preparations were made in an argon-filled glovebox (M. Braun,
Germany).

Assembly of 2032-Type Li–S
Coin Cell
Sulfur–graphene–magnesium
aluminate (SGM)-based ternary composite cathodes for cycling studies
were prepared as reported earlier by us.42 A 2032-type coin cell was assembled with the SGM electrode with
an areal sulfur loading of 0.5 mg/cm2 and the lithium metal
foil anode (Aldrich) with 0.25 mL of the as-prepared hybrid electrolytes.
This amount was found to be optimal for charge–discharge studies.
Further, an increase in the electrolyte volume led to leakage of the
electrolyte after crimping.

Electrochemical Characterization
The surface morphology
of the lithium metal–electrolyte interface was examined by
a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6301F, Japan) and an optical microscope,
and the viscosity of the hybrid electrolyte was measured using a Brookfield
DV1 viscometer. To investigate the surface properties of the lithium–electrolyte
interface, Raman and FTIR studies were carried out.

The ionic
conductivity of the electrolyte was measured by sandwiching a Celgard
2320 separator activated by the hybrid electrolyte by two stainless
steel blocking electrodes (1.0 cm in diameter) for various temperatures
using an electrochemical impedance analyzer (BioLogic, France) with
an alternating current sine wave perturbation of 10 mV between the
frequency ranges of 1 MHz and 50 mHz. To investigate the interfacial
properties of the lithium metal anode with the as-prepared electrolyte,
a symmetric nonblocking cell composed of Li/Celgard 2320 activated
by the hybrid electrolyte/Li was assembled, and the time dependence
of the impedance was analyzed at RT. The galvanostatic charge–discharge
profiles for the assembled 2032-type coin cell were measured between
3 and 1.6 V at ambient temperature by a computer-controlled battery
testing unit (Arbin, USA) as reported earlier.15

To study the interfacial properties and dendrite
growth in a lithium
metal anode, symmetrical coin cells of lithium electrodes in different
electrolyte solutions were assembled. The lithium metal foil was cut
into 10 mm diameter disks as lithium electrodes. A 2320-type Celgard
separator was employed to separate both the Li electrodes, and the
cycling behavior of the symmetrical cells was evaluated using an electrochemical
workstation (VSP3 BioLogic, France) at a current density of 0.10 mA
cm–2. The time for a single charge and discharge
process was 1 h each.29 The shuttle current
of the Li–S cell was measured at 2.3 V as proposed by Moy et
al.38 This study sheds more information
on the factors which influence the shuttling of polysulfide in a Li–S
cell.

To analyze the surface properties by FTIR, XPS, and Raman
spectroscopic
analyses, the lithium metal was exposed to bare and hybrid electrolytes
for 24 h in an argon-filled glovebox. The Raman spectra (HORIBA, model:
LabRAM HR Evolution) of the lithium surface was probed by a laser
source of 514 nm wavelength. The FTIR spectroscopy data were obtained
[Bruker Optik GmbH, Germany (model no: TENSOR 27, OPUS TM)] in ATR
mode. The ATR technique used in conjunction with infrared spectroscopy
enables samples to be analyzed in the solid or liquid state without
further preparation. The lithium/electrolyte interface was analyzed
by XPS (Thermo Scientific; model: ESCALAB 250 XI base system). A thin
lithium foil of area 10 mm2 with a thickness of 2–3
mm was carefully transferred to the XPS sample chamber using a vacuum
shuttle for analysis, as reported elsewhere.43
