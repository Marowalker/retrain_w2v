This article describes a unique combination
of inkjet printing
of functional materials with an intricate self-assembly process. Gold–silver
nanowire (NW) mesh films were produced by a sequential deposition
process, in which small metal seed nanoparticle film was deposited
at desired areas by inkjet printing, followed by coating with a thin
film of NW growth solution. Two different types of NW growth solutions
were used: the first, based on benzylhexadecyldimethylammonium chloride,
exhibited a bulk solution growth mode and was thus suitable for coverage
of large uniform areas. The second type was based on hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide, which induced NW growth confined to the substrate–solution
interface and thus enabled patterning of small transparent electrode
features, which have the same dimensions as the deposited seed droplets.
A selective silver plating bath was used to thicken the ultrathin
NWs, stabilize them, and reduce the sheet resistance, resulting in
films with sheet resistance in the range of 20–300 Ω/sq,
86–95% light transmission, and a relatively low haze. This
simple patterning method of the NW film works at ambient conditions
on many different types of substrates and has the potential to replace
the conventional photolithography used for indium tin oxide patterning
for applications such as touch sensors and flexible/stretchable electronics.

Introduction
The
quest for controlling the synthesis of metal nanowires (NWs)
and nanorods, produced by seeded growth techniques, has attracted
vast attention in recent years.1−5 Such nanostructures may be useful for printed electronic devices
as well as plasmonic/optical applications. One of the important applications
of controlled deposition of metal NWs is the production of transparent
electrodes (TEs).4,6−9

There is major interest
among various companies developing next-generation
displays to find a replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) as the transparent
electrode material, which is an essential part of displays, touch
screens, and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) illumination devices.10 This interest is driven by the desire to avoid
the need for indium, which is a rare element, to avoid expensive vacuum-based
sputter coating technology, which is required for the ITO film production,
and to produce highly flexible panels devoid of the brittle ITO.

Several interesting candidates for TE have been suggested during
recent years. These include conducting polymers,11 carbon nanotubes,12 graphene
films,13,14 nanoscale metallic gratings,15−18 and random networks of metal NWs19,20 made of copper7,21 and silver.6,22

Different deposition techniques
are used for the TE film materials
listed above: The conducting polymers are spin-coated on the desired
substrates and then possibly annealed and etched by oxygen plasma
to enhance conductivity.11 The carbon nanotube
network electrodes are deposited directly onto the surface of interest
via spin-coating or drop-casting, and by introducing conjugated polymers
to the nanotube suspensions, their dispersion in solvents and quality
of deposition are improved.12 High-quality
graphene films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, which
is prohibitively expensive.14 Nanoscale
metal gratings can be fabricated using various techniques, such as
simple deposition of metal nanorods/NWs.23 With the coffee ring effect, a micrometer-size droplet of liquid
containing solid particles is pinned to a substrate, and upon drying
of the droplet, the solid particles assemble into a ring. This enables
obtaining 2D arrays composed of interconnected conductive rings using
an inkjet printing technique.16 Another
fabrication technique of nanoscale metal gratings is the deposition
of silver nanoparticle dispersion on top of a stainless steel mesh
that is placed on the substrate, and after the removal of the mesh,
a grid pattern is left on the substrate.15

The random networks of metal NWs can be produced using copper,
where further alloying copper with nickel makes it gray (instead of
orange/red) and resistant to oxidation, and it is coated with poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) to prevent the aggregation of the NWs.21 Significant progress with copper nanowire synthesis enabled the
formation of very thin NWs, ∼15–35 nm in diameter, and
consequent thin films with improved performance in terms of low sheet
resistances with good optical transmission and low haze values.24−27

AgNWs are synthesized by the reduction of Ag nitrate in the
presence
of PVP in ethylene glycol. Removal of the PVP residues between the
silver NWs improves the junction conductance between silver NWs. An
ink prepared using these NWs can coat glass slides with a wire-wound
metering rod.22 Inkjet printing of silver
NWs has been used to pattern conductive features, followed by thermal
annealing or additional metal deposition to decrease the interwire
resistivity of the overlapping NWs and increase the conductivity of
the network.22,23 Alternatively, the silver NWs
could be inkjet printed without any post-treatment on top of a conducting
polymer film.28

Random networks of
gold–silver NWs were produced directly
on the substrates through surfactant-based soft-template systems,3,19 where the growth process occurred in a drying thin film containing
the growth solution directly on the desired substrate. However, so
far, all of the components of the NW growth process were mixed together
prior to deposition on the substrate, thus limiting the shelf life
of the solution to ∼1 min and maintaining a complicated interdependence
of different process parameters.

In this article, we present
a significant advancement in the above-mentioned
NW deposition scheme, splitting the NW film preparation into three
stages of controllable transparency, sheet resistance, and spatial
NW distribution. Ultrathin gold–silver NWs (from now on will
be called UTNWs) are formed on top of the substrate of interest (glass
or various polymers), at selected areas, defined by inkjet printing
(or possibly other printing techniques). The process is illustrated
in Figure 1: First,
very small metal seed particles (“Nanogold”, 1.4 nm)
are printed where the growth of the NW film is desired. Second, a
thin film of the NW growth solution is deposited. The growth solution
is a surfactant-based soft-template system, where the surfactants
used are either benzylhexadecyldimethylammonium chloride (BDAC) or
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which is the more common
surfactant for the preparation of metal nanorods and NWs and has different
properties from BDAC.29 Whereas CTAB leads
to the formation of UTNWs strictly at the solution–substrate
interface,3 the BDAC-based process produces
UTNWs in the bulk solution.29 The gold–silver
UTNWs formed at this stage would typically be ∼2–4 nm
in diameter and occur in bundles consisting of anywhere between single
wires to hundreds of wires. Due to their small diameter, these UTNWs
would not be stable over time and spontaneously fragment (Rayleigh
instability).30 Therefore, a third metal
deposition step would be required to make them thicker, hence stable,
and lower their resistance. The last step has to be selective to thicken
the preformed UTNWs without depositing metal elsewhere on the substrate.
We have developed a selective catalytic electroless silver-plating
process to thicken and stabilize the UTNWs. The parameters of the
electroless metal deposition step would determine the final thickness
of the silver-coated NWs (to be called AgNWs for the rest of the article),
hence controlling the final film’s sheet resistance and transparency.

Figure 1 Illustration
of the NW deposition process. In the first step, seed
particles are printed at desired positions on the substrate. In the
second step, either CTAB- or BDAC-based NW growth solution is deposited
on the substrate, where surface or bulk growth of UTNWs, respectively,
occurs. After washing away the growth solution, the dried NWs mesh
remains attached to the surface, and finally a silver-plating process
over the UTNWs increases their diameter, hence stabilizing them and
lowering the sheet resistance.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Uniform Films
Seeding
The density of seed particles deposited (by
droplet jetting) on the substrate could be controlled by the concentration
of the seed solution, droplet size (via the diameter of the capillary
used for jetting), and the droplet spacing. Typical dispensing capillary
size was 80 μm (producing droplets of ∼200 pL) and seed
concentration was in the range 4.2 × 10–8–1.8
× 10–7 M. The droplets were typically printed
with their rims nearly touching or slightly overlapping to obtain
an average surface density of ∼1–500 seeds/μm2.

NW Growth
The NW growth process
can be done either
with CTAB- or BDAC-based solutions. In a previous work, Azulai et
al. have studied the seed concentration dependence of CTAB-based NW
growth.4 They found that UTNWs bundles
were formed at high enough concentration, and when this concentration
was reduced below some threshold, the morphology changed to less uniform,
thicker NWs. It has also been confirmed in several studies that this
type of NWs grew only at the solution–substrate interface (surface
growth).3,19,31

In the
present work, we studied the seed concentration dependence of the
BDAC-based NW growth (bulk growth): After drying the seed solution
droplets on the substrate, a typical volume of ∼50 μL
of the BDAC-based growth solution per 1 cm2 of seed-coated
surface was deposited. This resulted in bundles of UTNWs with average
diameter of 3.4 ± 0.8 nm, and about 75:25% Au/Ag atomic ratio,
as shown in Figure 2a,b. These UTNWs bundles look identical to those grown in CTAB.4 The bundles typically consist of single up to
hundreds of UTNWs, with typical total lateral dimensions ∼3–200
nm, and single UTNW height. We have previously observed that in the
CTAB-based nanowires, the silver was evenly distributed along the
NWs.32

The formation of UTNWs using BDAC (or CTAB) as
the templating surfactant
is initiated in the solution with the reduction of Au(III) ions to
Au(I) state by the ascorbic acid molecules (or ascorbate ions). The
Au and Ag ions form complexes with the BDAC or CTAB molecules, which
allows for the reduction to the final metallic state only in the presence
of the catalytic metal seeds particles printed on the surface of the
substrate. The mechanism of formation of UTNWs is a self-assembly
process occurring in the thin layer of growth solution deposited on
the substrate. It should be emphasized that the BDAC-based growth
solution leads to bulk growth of UTNWs in the thin solution film volume,
as reported by Qian et al.29 Hence, we
believe that the UTNW network, which grows within the whole volume
of the BDAC-based solution, weakly attaches to the substrate at random
locations, and, finally, after washing, flattens down on the surface,
held by strong van der Waals attraction to the substrate. This will
be further illustrated in the discussion of patterned deposition later
on.

Although the mechanism by which gold nanorods31 or UTNWs4,33 evolve from gold seed
particles
using CTAB as surfactant has been studied in the past, it is still
partly unknown. Because the reduction of gold (and also silver) ions
by ascorbic acid (or ascorbate ions) can only occur catalytically
at the surface of the seed particles, it is clear that the seed particles
are incorporated within the grown nanorods or UTNWs.2,4,31,33 In the case of the UTNWs, it seems that their formation, at least
in the CTAB-based process, involves the joining of short segments
of the UTNWs into continuous ones.33 This
topic will be further studied in the future.

We assume that
the seed particles have to be detached from the
surface to be incorporated in the surfactant template and evolve into
nanowires. The difference between the two surfactants is that BDAC
is more soluble than CTAB. Hence, CTAB accumulates faster at the surface,
as the growth solution is brought in contact with the seed-coated
substrate and immobilizes the seed particles at the interface region,
whereas in the case of BDAC, they can diffuse farther into the solution.

Silver Plating
We have used a selective electroless
silver-plating process (also called “silver enhancement”)
to thicken and stabilize the UTNWs and to enhance the film conductivity.
Silver deposition was preferred over the previously used gold deposition4,34 because, unlike gold, silver does not have interband transitions
in the visible range and is therefore more transparent across this
wavelength range.

A TEM image of the AgNWs grown with the BDAC-based
growth solution, after the silver enhancement process, can be seen
in Figure 2c. The UTNWs
bundles coated with silver now became unified stripes of silver nanowires,
about 20–200 nm wide. Before the silver enhancement, the sample
sheet resistance was of the order 1 kΩ/sq (which degraded over
time), the visible transmission was about 98–99%, and the haze
was same as that of bare substrate within the ∼0.3% haze measurement
accuracy, both on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and glass. Figure 2d–f (see also
the Supporting Information, Figure S3)
provides the topographic AFM data for a AgNW film prepared on a PET
substrate. The height of the AgNWs varies between 10 and 40 nm, with
the most frequent height at ∼25–30 nm, which is the
result of thickening of bundles consisting of single UTNWs layer.

Figure 3 presents
the results of a study of the influence of the areal density of printed
seeds on the AgNWs final density (using BDAC-based process) and hence
on the final sheet resistance. Due to charging of the insulating substrate,
it is not possible to reliably image the UTNWs grown on glass or PET
substrates by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM);
hence, all of the SEM imaging was done on the AgNWs. When the density
of seeds is very large (∼>500 seeds/μm2) or
very small (<5 seeds/μm2), the sheet resistance
rises to very high values (>1 kΩ/sq), with good correlation
to low AgNWs density (shown in the inset SEM images). Between ∼8
and ∼100 seeds/μm2, we obtained relatively
low sheet resistance values (≤100 Ω/sq) with high AgNWs
density but with a nonmonotonous dependence of sheet resistance on
seed density.

Figure 3 Plot of the sheet resistance of the AgNW films (grown
with BDAC,
after silver enhancement) vs number of seeds per 1 μm2 area. The insets are representative SEM images of the films.

As the seed areal density is increased
from ∼4 to ∼8
seeds/μm2, a significant improvement in conductance
and NWs density occurs, reaching less than 50 Ω/sq for ∼8
seeds/μm2. Further increase in the seed density seems
to initially deteriorate the NW density and increase the sheet resistance,
but then toward ∼60 seeds/μm2, the NW density
increases to a higher value and sheet resistance drops. With further
increase in seed density, it becomes clear that too high concentration
of seed particles reduces the aspect ratio of the grown NWs (200–300
seeds/μm2), and, finally, completely inhibits NW
formation (>500 seeds/μm2), probably due to distribution
of the deposited gold and silver atoms over too many seed particles.
The two local minima of the curve in Figure 3 correspond to different NW densities, but
apparently the lower one (8 seeds/μm2) is compensated
by higher aspect ratios and better connectivity of the NW network.

The seed density/concentration used here for the BDAC-based process
is similar to that used by Azulai et al. in CTAB-based UTNWs formation.4 Their seeds concentration was in the range of
0.67–2.1 × 10–8 M. Taking such a concentration
in a growth solution comparable to the present work (50 μL/1
cm2), one obtains the equivalent of ∼50–100
seeds/μm2. This concentration is similar to the second
sheet resistance minimum (∼60 seeds/μm2).
In light of the knowledge accumulated for the CTAB-based surface growth
process,3,4 we believe that similarly, this second minimum
in the BDAC-based process may combine surface/interface growth mode,
which requires nearly an order of magnitude larger concentration of
seed particles compared with the BDAC-based bulk solution growth mode.29 The latter is probably responsible for the first
sheet resistance minimum at ∼8 seeds/μm2.

After silver plating, the sheet resistance of the samples (prepared
with suitable seed density) was in the range of 20–300 Ω/sq,
with visible transmission in the range of ∼86–95% on
PET and glass substrate areas between 4 and 100 cm2. Optical
transmission values are given for a wavelength of 550 nm (for full
spectrum, see the Supporting Information, Figure S7). The SEM images of AgNW films, prepared using BDAC- and
CTAB-based processes, on 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 PET substrates
can be seen in Figure 4 (see also the Supporting Information, Figures S4–S6). The sheet resistance of these samples was 40
and 30 Ω/sq, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the silver
deposition process was selective, and only the UTNWs were thickened
without metal deposition directly on the substrate (see also the Supporting
Information, Figures S1 and S2), and with
almost no low aspect ratio particles of significant size contaminating
the sample after the silver-enhancement step. It is highly probable
that some metal particles adsorbed to the substrate before the silver
coating were washed away from the substrate during the silver deposition
or washing steps.

Figure 4 (a) SEM image of an AgNW film, grown with BDAC-based solution,
on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 PET substrate. The sample’s
sheet resistance was 40 Ω/sq and the seed areal density was
60 seeds/μm2. The inset shows an AgNW film coated
on a 10 × 10 cm2 PET substrate, demonstrating flexibility
and high coating uniformity and optical quality. (b) SEM image of
an AgNW film, grown with CTAB-based solution, on a 2.5 × 2.5
cm2 PET substrate. The sample’s sheet resistance
was 30 Ω/sq

Using TEM-energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and SEM-EDS,
we found that the Au/Ag composition in the UTNWs before the silver
plating was ∼75/25% and changed to 60–95% Ag after the
silver deposition, depending on the amount of Ag plated on the UTNWs
(see EDS data in the Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2), which together with the TEM and AFM images of the
AgNWs proves that a substantial silver layer (∼10–30
nm) was formed on top of the UTNWs.

Figure 5a,c displays
the optical transmission versus sheet resistance for different AgNW
films deposited on glass and PET for both the CTAB- and BDAC-based
processes. Tunability of the two parameters is achieved through the
timings of nanowire growth and silver deposited on top of the wires.
It can be seen that even at relatively low sheet resistance (∼70
Ω/sq) the transparency is ∼90% for BDAC-grown NWs and
>90% for CTAB-based process.

Figure 5 Optical transmission for BDAC-based (a)
and CTAB-based (c) processes,
and (b, d) haze vs sheet resistance for continuous AgNW films prepared
with different levels of NW density and/or silver plating timing.
The transmission and haze were measured at a wavelength of 550 nm.
The insets in the graphs corresponding to the CTAB-based process show
the same data points plotted as (inset c) extinction (=100% –
transmittance) and (inset d) haze as a function of conductance (1/RS, where RS is the
sheet resistance), which are fitted to a parabola.

Moreover, the haze versus sheet resistance graphs
in Figure 5b,d show
that a relatively
low haze (fraction of the scattered light out of the total transmitted)
is achieved for our films (∼0.6–0.8%) at ∼100
Ω/sq, and ∼1% haze was reached at lower sheet resistance
values (∼50 Ω/sq). The haze level higher than 1% is considered
disruptive for display application, as it reduces the sharpness and
clarity of the image, but it is acceptable for organic photovoltaic
and light-emitting diode devices in which lower sheet resistance is
required.

The slopes of the haze and transmission graphs change
with sheet
resistance, especially in the case of the CTAB-based AgNWs (Figure 5c,d). Because haze
(and partly the extinction) originates in light scattering, we can
check whether the nonlinearity in the curves may be related to light
scattering: Assuming a roughly cylindrical cross section of radius r for the AgNWs, the resistance of the AgNWs is given by R = ρ × L/A, where ρ is the resistivity, L is the NW
length, and A is the cross-sectional area, which
scales as A ∝ r2. Hence, the sheet resistance drops (and conductance increases) with
the increase in AgNW thickness as the diameter is squared. The magnitude
of Rayleigh scattering (I) increases as the square
of the polarizability α, (I ∝ α2), which scales as the square of the volume (α ∝ V, and V ∝ r2 for a cylinder of constant length).35 This results in a higher power (∼4) dependence of light scattering
on the AgNW diameter. We would therefore expect that as the radii
of the nanowires increase (by more silver deposition), the light scattering
(haze) would increase as the square of the conductance, as roughly
demonstrated in the inset of Figure 5d. The same should roughly hold for the extinction
if it is dominated by scattering (inset of Figure 5c).

Patterning of the NW Films
To optimize the UTNW deposition
process for narrow stripe patterns, we compared the two UTNW growth
modes, “surface growth” using CTAB-based solution3 versus “bulk growth” using BDAC-based
solution.29 In these experiments, single
seed droplet wide lines were printed on the PET substrates followed
by the deposition of the UTNW growth solution over the whole substrate,
followed by the silver plating bath.

Figure 6a displays the deposited and dried seed droplet
lines after silver enhancement of the seed particles to make them
visible in the high-resolution SEM. The 80:20% water/ethanol droplets,
deposited from a 40 μm orifice (droplet volume ∼70 pL),
were spread on the PET substrate in ∼70 μm diameter spots.
The AgNW film stripes grown from continuous seed lines, formed by
overlapping seed solution droplets, were confined to the same dimension
(Figure 6b–d).
To further learn about the confined UTNW surface growth mode, a single
seed droplet spot was deposited on a PET substrate and the grown NWs
were imaged. As seen in Figure 7, the AgNWs were tightly confined to the ∼100 μm
seed spot with a fairly sharp edge, where the AgNWs abruptly terminate,
except for occasional small protrusions of the order of ∼10
μm.

Figure 6 SEM images of CTAB-based AgNW stripes, patterned on a PET substrate
in lines of ∼70 μm wide seed droplets and separated by
∼1 mm. (a) Printed lines of seed droplets imaged after silver
enhancement. The droplets were printed partially overlapping along
the lines to produce continuous seed lines. (b–d) Increasing
magnification of grown AgNW stripes, confined to the same width as
the seed droplets. The droplets were printed with a slight overlap.
The blurred bright areas seen in (c) and (d) are due to charging of
the insulating areas out of the NW stripes.

Figure 7 (a) SEM image of CTAB-based AgNW film grown on a single seed droplet
printed by a 80 μm orifice on a PET substrate. (b) A higher-magnification
image of the droplet border.

Figure 8 displays
the results of growing the NWs over a single seed droplet wide line
using a BDAC growth solution. The BDAC-based UTNWs growth clearly
occurred in the bulk solution by seed particles that detached from
the substrate and became mobile in the solution through convection
and diffusion. BDAC is substantially more soluble in water compared
with CTAB and thus accumulates more slowly on the surface when the
growth solution touches the substrate. Hence, with BDAC-based growth
solution, most of the seed particle may diffuse deeper into bulk solution
film and lead to the UTNW formation away from their original position.
In the CTAB-based growth solution, most of the seeds are confined
to the proximity of the surface due to very fast accumulation of CTAB
on the surface and, thus, grow at the substrate–solution interface.

Figure 8 SEM images
of BDAC-based AgNW films deposited on a PET substrate,
with seeds patterned in ∼100 μm wide lines (single seed
droplet width) and separated by ∼1 mm. (a, b) Low-magnification
SEM images showing a higher metal density along the patterned seed
lines due to some seed particles remaining attached to the surface
and silver enhanced. (c, d) Higher-magnification SEM images showing
that the resulting AgNW film extends far beyond the deposited seed
droplet lines, demonstrating bulk solution UTNW growth. The border
of the printed seed stripe is marked with the blue lines (seeds were
deposited on the right side of the blue lines).

Accordingly, in the CTAB-based process, the surface-confined
UTNW
growth is found to be highly suitable for patterning the NW films
on the substrates. As seen in Figures 6 and 7, the formed AgNWs are
constricted to the original spots where the seed particles were deposited.

The difference between the obtained line patterns in the two UTNW
growth modes is also demonstrated through conductance measurements.
The AgNW stripes grown with the CTAB-based solution showed sheet resistance
of ∼50 Ω/sq along the lines, and no conductivity was
measured in the perpendicular direction (across the printed lines).
On the other hand, the lines grown with BDAC showed a higher sheet
resistance along the lines (>100 Ω/sq), and finite conductance
was also measured perpendicular to the printed lines.

Various
combinations of the two surfactants within the growth solution
may be used to control the UTNW density and their spread on the substrate.
The thickness of the growth solution needed for optimal UTNW growth,
especially in the bulk growth mode using BDAC, is also an important
parameter that was not optimized in the current work.

The separated
seed deposition and UTNW growth steps allow a tightly
controllable printing mode on a variety of substrates. In particular,
use of small-diameter orifices for inkjet printing of the seed solution
combined with control of solvent wetting of the substrate should enable
patterning of the NW films with <70 μm features (probably
down to 20–30 μm). The density of the NWs on the surface
can be controlled by the amount of the deposited seed particles4 and the time of growth. The parameters of the
silver-plating step would determine the final thickness of the AgNWs,
and, hence, the final film sheet resistance, transparency, and haze
level.

This method has several advantages over other metal NW
deposition
techniques: first, in some of the other techniques, the nanorods/NWs
are coated by an insulating polymer (typically PVP), and it is necessary
to form electrical contacts between them through heating, other postdeposition
treatments, or additional conducting polymer films, whereas in the
technique described here, interwire contacts are spontaneously formed
under ambient conditions during UTNW formation. Also, preformed, typically
micronscale long NWs can clog inkjet printing nozzles if small orifice
nozzles (of the order of 10 μm or less) are used for high-resolution
pattern deposition, whereas with the current technique, the largest
printed objects are the 1.4 nm seed particles.

The standard
methods of patterning the preformed Ag or Cu nanowire
films are laser patterning or chemical etching through a polymer mask
formed by photolithography. Laser patterning is a serial technique
(as inkjet printing). The photolithographic process is a parallel
one, which is more efficient but involves several steps: spinning
the photoresist, baking it, exposing to UV light through a mask, development
of resist, applying the etching solution, and removal of the resist
pattern. Thus, it seems that for certain applications, the direct
inkjet NW patterning using a suitable fast printer would have several
advantages over the postdeposition patterning done in the case of
the standard Ag/Cu NW technology. One of the advantages would be the
ambient conditions used for our process, in contrast to higher temperatures
used for different stages of the other patterning processes.

Conclusions
A scalable printing process for the preparation of metal NW films
has been developed. It is a highly versatile process, where in one
version it allows uniformly coating large area surfaces of different
kinds (glass, polymer) through growth of the NWs in the bulk of a
thin solution film based on BDAC template. In a second version, a
CTAB-based growth solution enables surface UTNW growth mode, which
tightly confines the grown UTNWs to inkjet-printed seed particle patterns
on the surface. Although we used ∼70 μm seed spots, it
may be possible to reduce the jetting device to orifices of the order
of 10 μm in diameter and thus reduce the NW stripe dimension
to such widths, which should suffice for standard touch screen patterns
(as used with ITO). Alternatively, other high-resolution printing
techniques could be used to pattern the seed particles, such as microcontact
printing.36 In addition, the final silver-plating
process can be replaced by catalytic deposition of other metals, such
as nickel, to change the properties of the NWs.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The reagents used for the metal NW film preparation,
i.e., BDAC, CTAB, HAuCl4, AgNO3, ascorbic acid,
sodium ascorbate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), citric acid, trisodium
citrate, and hydroquinone, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further purification. The Au seed particles (Nanogold) were
purchased from Nanoprobes Inc. The water used was ultrapure (18 MΩ
cm), obtained from a USF ELGA UHQ system.

Deposition of the Gold–Silver
NW Films
Step 1: Metal Seed Particle Solution Was Printed on the Desired
Area on the Substrate
Au seed nanoparticles of size ∼1.4
nm (Nanogold, ∼55 gold atoms) were used. A 10–7 M solution of seeds in a mixture of 50:50% water/ethanol by volume
(or 80:20% water/ethanol for patterning) was used for printing a pattern,
where the growth of the NW film is desired, on different substrates
such as glass, polyimide, and different types of PET and conducting
polymers. Inkjet printing of seed solution was done using a MicroFab
Jetlab-4 system, with 80 and 40 μm internal diameter piezoactuated
jetting devices.

Step 2: Growth Solution Deposited on the
Substrate Was Used
To Form the UTNWs
This step involves deposition of a UTNW
growth solution either in the same places where the seed solution
was deposited or uniformly over the whole substrate. In both cases,
the UTNW film would grow only in areas where the seed particles were
deposited.

BDAC Growth Solution29
The
growth solution was prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of BDAC (0.1
M, 10 mL), HAuCl4 (0.01 M, 421 μL), AgNO3 (0.01 M, 512 μL), and ascorbic acid (0.1 M, 268 μL)
sequentially at 30 °C in a 20 mL glass vial. The usable time
of the solution was at least 1 h. About 50 μL of the growth
solution per 1 cm2 of substrate area was deposited and
incubated for 20 min at ∼30 °C. Then, the substrate was
washed by dipping for 1 min in methanol and 1 min in water.

CTAB
Growth Solution4
For
the CTAB-based growth procedure, we used a mixture of 10–7 M seeds with 2.8 M sodium ascorbate in an aqueous solution. The
growth solution was prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of CTAB (0.25
M, 10 mL), HAuCl4 (0.025 M, 500 μL), and AgNO3 (0.1 M, 250 μL) sequentially at 35 °C in a 20
mL glass vial. About 50 μL of the growth solution per 1 cm2 of substrate area was deposited on the substrate for 1–5
min at room temperature. Then, the substrate was washed by dipping
for 1 min in 70% ethanol/water and 1 min in water.

Step 3: Selective
Silver Deposition To Enhance the Film’s
Conductivity and Stabilize the UTNWs, and Obtain the AgNWs
A catalytic electroless silver-plating process was used to thicken
and stabilize the UTNWs. The silver-plating solution was prepared
by mixing aqueous solutions of BSA (0.5% w/v, 200 mL), AgNO3 (0.1 M, 1.11 mL), citric acid and sodium citrate buffer (1.2 and
1.6 M, respectively, 11.1 mL), and hydroquinone (0.3 M, 33 mL) sequentially
at 26 °C.

The substrates with NW films were dipped for
1–6 min in the silver-plating solution. Then, the samples were
washed for 1 min in methanol and 1 min in water.

Microscopy
Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM)
NW film samples
were deposited on carbon-coated copper grids (SPI). For the silver-coated
NWs, we used carbon-coated nickel grids. Images were recorded using
a Philips FEI Tecnai F20 TEM. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) was used to determine the nanowire composition.

Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM imaging was
carried out in a Quanta200 field emission gun environmental SEM using
the FEI wet-STEM detector. To examine the AgNW films deposited on
nonconducting substrates (glass, PET), we used water vapor environment
(low vacuum). Also, in the SEM, EDS was used to determine AgNW composition,
either averaging over relatively large areas of the coating or measuring
over individual AgNWs, or background.

Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM)
Topography imaging was
done using a NT-MDT P47 AFM using standard silicon tips (HQ-NSC35,
MikroMasch) in tapping mode.

Sheet Resistance, Transparency,
and Haze Characterization
The optical transmission and haze
of the films were measured against
a reference blank substrate in a fiber-coupled array spectrophotometer
(Ocean Optics, S2000) connected to an integrating sphere, at a wavelength
range of 400–900 nm. The transmission values are reported in
the paper for a wavelength of 550 nm. The haze (fraction of scattered
light) was calculated from four optical transmission measurements
made by mounting the specimen at the input of the integrating sphere:
haze = [(T4/T2) – (T3/T1)] × 100%, where T1 is a
measurement of the incident light with no specimen and closed sphere, T2 is a measurement of the total light transmitted
through the specimen with a closed sphere, T3 is a measurement of the light scattered by the instrument
with no specimen, with an open sphere (light passing through the sphere)
and a light trap, and T4 is a measurement
of the light scattered by the instrument and the specimen, with an
open sphere and a light trap.

Sheet resistance measurements
were carried out by two-terminal measurements using silver paint at
the edges of the substrates for defining the contacts and employing
a Fluke multimeter. The silver paint lines defined a square measurement
cell (typically 2 × 2 cm2) over the whole coated area.
Therefore, the measured resistance value was roughly also the sheet
resistance value. We estimate an error of the order of 5% in the estimation
of RS using this method due to film edge
effects. Occasional comparisons to four-terminal measurements agreed
with the two-terminal measurements to an accuracy of ∼20%.
