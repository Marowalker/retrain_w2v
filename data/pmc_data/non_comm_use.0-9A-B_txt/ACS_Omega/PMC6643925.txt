Palladium nanoparticles (NPs) have
been obtained by decomposition
of well-defined palladium complexes noncovalently anchored onto the
surface of reduced graphene oxide. Morphological analysis by microscopy
showed the presence of small palladium NPs homogeneously distributed
on the support. Characterization by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
confirmed that palladium NPs contain Pd(2+) and Pd(0) oxidation states
and the presence of N-heterocyclic carbene and bromo ligands. The
catalytic properties of the NPs with and without the support have
been evaluated in the hydrogenation of alkynes. Supported palladium
NPs showed increased activity versus the nonsupported ones and could
be recycled up to 10 times without the loss of catalytic activity.
The composition of the palladium NPs is different for each catalytic
cycle indicating a dynamic process and the formation of different
catalytic active species. On the contrary, the unsupported palladium
NPs showed limited activity caused by decomposition and could not
be recycled. The role of the support has been investigated. The results
indicate that the support influences the stability of palladium NPs.

Introduction
Palladium plays a major
role in the synthesis of value chemicals
and pharmaceuticals by carbon–carbon coupling and hydrogenation
catalytic reactions.1−9 The nature of the catalytic active species is under continuous debate,
and different types have been proposed as key intermediates including
molecular complexes, clusters, single atoms, and nanoparticles (NPs).10−14 Among them, palladium NPs have received an increasing attention
because they are observed in many catalytic processes and serve as
a class of highly active catalysts.15−18 An important limitation in the
use of NPs arise from deactivation by sintering or agglomeration.
Functionalization of metal NPs with organic ligands avoids aggregation
and controls the particle size and distribution.19−21 These properties
markedly regulate the catalytic applications of metal NPs. However,
even the functionalized NPs suffer dynamic changes at the surface
during the catalytic reactions, and single atoms and/or metal clusters
are released to the reaction media forming new species.22 If the generation of the new species is not
reversible, the original NPs evolve into the formation of different
metal NPs with different catalytic properties. As an alternative,
the use of supports is a complementary approach to increase the stability
of metal NPs functionalized with organic ligands.23−27 The combination of ligands for avoiding particle
agglomeration with supports increases the potential catalytic applications
of the hybrid catalytic materials, especially in the recycling and
reuse of metal NPs.

Palladium NPs functionalized with N-heterocyclic
carbene (NHC)
ligands show potential applications in catalysis, and ligand-free
palladium NPs have been immobilized onto graphene, but the combination
of organic ligands and graphene is unexplored.28,29 In this article, we discuss the preparation of palladium NPs (Pd-NPs)
containing NHC ligands by the decomposition of well-defined organometallic
complexes.30−32 The catalytic properties of the Pd-NPs are evaluated
in the hydrogenation of alkynes as a benchmark reaction. We describe
the influence of graphene as a support for the Pd-NPs and the potential
benefits in catalytic applications. The use of NHC ligands and graphene
as a support allows reusing and recycling the palladium NPs. The modular
approach, starting from molecular complexes, NPs, and immobilization,
allows an in-deep characterization of the materials and offers the
opportunity to study the influence of the individual components in
the design of hybrid catalytic systems.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis,
Immobilization, and Characterization of 2 and 2-rGO
The palladium complex 2 at the molecular level
or supported onto reduced graphene oxide
(2-rGO) was used for the synthesis of free and supported
palladium NPs (Scheme 1). Complex 2 was obtained by the methodology described
for the palladium PEPPSI-type complexes.33 The imidazolium salt 1 was reacted with palladium(II)
chloride and potassium carbonate in 3-chloropyridine to afford complex 2 in good yield. An excess of sodium bromide was added to
the reaction media to avoid halide scrambling in the final product.
Complex 2 was fully characterized by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, ESI-MS spectrometry, elemental analysis,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV/vis absorption spectroscopy,
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We observed that TGA is a valuable
characterization technique for palladium PEPPSI-type complexes because
it shows the sequential mass losses assigned to different palladium
ligands (Figure S17 in the Supporting Information). The molecular structure of 2 was confirmed by X-ray
crsytallography (Figure 1a). The palladium shows a distorted square-planar environment with
the Br ligands in the trans position. The crystal packing reveals
that the pyrene tag of different molecules are close in proximity
showing π-staking interactions with an interplanar distance
of 3.5 Å (Figure 1b).

pyrene tags of 3.5 Å.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Palladium Complex 2, Immobilization
onto
rGO (2-rGO), and Synthesis of Free Palladium NPs (2-NPs) and Supported onto rGO (2-rGO-NPs)
The immobilization of complex 2 onto graphene for
obtaining the hybrid material 2-rGO was carried out,
as previously described.34,35 This methodology allows
a controlled grafting of molecular complexes on the surface of reduced
rGO. The immobilization conditions are mild; therefore, it is expected
that the properties of the rGO and the metal complex are preserved.
The pyrene tag permits the formation of π-interactions with
graphene that retain the molecular complex attached to the material.
The π-staking interactions are considered weak but their multiplicity,
such in the case of graphene, grants the efficient immobilization
of molecular complexes. This is evidenced by the formation of short-distance
interactions at the molecular level as the ones found in the crystal
packing of complex 2. We have previously observed that
ruthenium, iridium, and gold molecular complexes containing a pyrene
group form strong π-staking interactions with rGO. The catalytic
properties reveal that these interactions are maintained during the
recycling experiments.36−41

Characterization of 2-rGO was performed by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), XPS, UV–vis, Raman,
and TG, and the exact amount of complex 2 onto graphene
was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS)
analysis (Supporting Information). The
result of the ICP/MS analysis accounted for a 5.5% w/w of 2 onto the graphene surface. XPS analysis was used for the characterization
of complex 2 and the hybrid material 2-rGO. This technique provides valuable information of elemental composition
and oxidation states. XPS analysis of 2 showed the presence
of palladium, nitrogen, bromine, and carbon. As expected for the molecular
complex, the binding energies of Pd confirm the +2 oxidation state.
A comparative XPS analysis of 2 and 2-rGO shows the characteristic core-level peaks of Pd 3d, Br 3d, N 1s,
and Cl 2p at the same binding energy for the molecular complex and
the hybrid material (Figures 2 and S21). The XPS analysis confirms
the immobilization of molecular complex 2 onto the surface
of graphene. All of these techniques suggest that properties of the
rGO and the palladium complex 2 are preserved during
the formation of the hybrid material 2-rGO. In addition,
we know the exact nature and composition of the palladium species
deposited onto the surface of graphene.

and Br 3d for complex 2 (a,b) and hybrid material 2-rGO (c,d). See the Supporting Information for details.

Synthesis and Characterization
of 2-NPs and 2-rGO-NPs
We observed
a change in color of the solution
when exposing the molecular complex 2 to hydrogen under
basic conditions. The initial pale yellow solution of 2 in toluene darkens in 20 min, and after 3 h, there is a black precipitate
(Figure 3). This black
precipitate corresponds to the formation of palladium NPs (2-NPs). Decomposition of the palladium complex [Pd(NHC)(Br)2(Cl-Py)] leads to the formation of palladium NPs containing NHC ligands
from an organometallic approach.42−47 The presence of ligands avoids aggregation and controls the size
of the NPs. HRTEM images confirmed the presence of small palladium
NPs with a worm shape (Figure 4a). The XPS analysis reveals the presence of palladium, carbon,
nitrogen, and bromine but not of chlorine. The 3-chloropyridine ligand
is lost during the NP formation. This ligand is labile., Uncoordination
of the metal center is usually observed in Pd-PEPPSI catalytic reactions.
High-resolution XPS analysis shows the presence of two doublets for
the core-level peaks of Pd 3d, indicating the presence of Pd(0) and
Pd(2+) oxidation states (Figure 4b). The results showed that 2-NPs contain
palladium atoms in two oxidation states, NHC and Br ligands. NHC ligands
have previously been used to avoid aggregation in palladium NPs.48−52

toluene in the presence of Cs2CO3 at 65 °C.

Figure 4 HRTEM image of 2-NPs (a) and XPS
analysis (b) showing
the presence of Pd(0) and Pd(2+).

The hybrid material 2-rGO was exposed under
the same
conditions as the molecular complex 2 for the formation
of palladium NPs. HRTEM images of the hybrid material 2-rGO before the exposure to hydrogen showed the single-layer nature of
graphene and the absence of palladium NPs (Figure 5a). The EDS elemental mapping confirms the
elemental composition of the molecular complex 2 (Pd,
N, Br, and Cl) and the homogeneous distribution of the complex over
all of the graphene surface (Figures S23 and S24). On the contrary, HRTEM images of the hybrid material 2-rGO after the exposure to hydrogen showed the formation of palladium
NPs of an average size of 4 nm and spherical shape (Figure 5b). The presence of rGO influences
the shape of the palladium NPs from worm shape to spherical shape.
XPS analysis before the exposure to hydrogen confirmed the presence
of only Pd(2+) species in the 2-rGO hybrid material
(Figure 5c). After
the exposure to H2, XPS analysis confirms the presence
of palladium, nitrogen, bromine, carbon, and oxygen. More interesting
is the formation of Pd(0) oxidation state that coexists with Pd(2+)
as in 2-NPs (Figure 5d). These results suggest that exposing 2-rGO to hydrogen under basic conditions produce palladium NPs of Pd(2+)
and Pd(0) that contain NHC and bromo ligands immobilized onto graphene.
The average size of the palladium NPs are slightly smaller compared
to the particles formed using the molecular complex 2. Graphene acts as a support for the production of small and well-dispersed
palladium NPs. We have observed that graphene acts as an NP sponge
in the in situ formation of gold particles by laser ablation. The
results revealed a control of the particle size, and the gold NPs
obtained in the presence of graphene were smaller.53 This process is general, and many reports confirm the immobilization
of metal NPs on the surface of graphene by interactions of the d-metal
orbitals with the π-delocalized electronic density of the graphene
material.29,54,55

Catalytic Studies
The catalytic hydrogenation of alkynes
was evaluated using molecular hydrogen at low pressure with the precatalysts
molecular complex 2 and the hybrid material 2-rGO. The catalytic active palladium NPs (2-NPs and 2-rGO-NPs) were generated in situ under appropriate reaction
conditions. In a general procedure, a Schlenk flask was charged with
the catalyst, base, alkyne, and solvent. Then, a balloon of H2 (∼1 bar) was connected to the system, and the reaction
was immersed in a preheated oil bath. The monitoring of the reaction
and the product distribution were analyzed by GC chromatography and 1H NMR using anisole as an internal standard. The hydrogenation
reaction is general and works for different bases and solvents. Control
experiments using only rGO reveal that palladium species
are active catalysts. After optimization using diphenylacetylene as
a model substrate, the best reaction conditions in terms of activity
and selectivity are catalytic amounts of Cs2CO3, dry toluene, and 65 °C.

Reaction monitoring profile
in the hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-butyne with precatalyst 2 (1 mol %) showed an induction period of 15 min, indicating the formation
of the catalytic active species 2-NPs (Figure 6a). Then, the alkyne was hydrogenated
to the Z-alkene in excellent yield and with good
stereoselectivity (t = 1.5 h, alkyne conversion =
97%, alkenes yield: 92%, ratio Z/E = 95:5, and alkane yield 5%). Catalyst 2-NPs is highly
stereoselective for the cis isomer even at high alkyne conversion.
When the alkyne was consumed, the E and Z alkenes were hydrogenated to the corresponding alkane. As the hydrogenation
process was sequential, the formation of alkanes could be avoided
by stopping the reaction at convenient time. Selective palladium catalysts
in the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes are scarce, and over-reduction
is better controlled by transfer hydrogenation methodologies.56−60 The reaction monitoring using precatalyst 2-rGO showed
an identical profile to catalyst 2-NPs but with a longer
induction period (30 min) (Figure 6b). Comparison of the catalytic activity of 2-NPs versus 2-rGO-NPs revealed that the reaction using catalyst 2-rGO-NPs started later because of a longer induction period
but then proceeded at higher rates. This result is significantly different
if we consider that catalyst 2-rGO-NPs contains half
amount of palladium compared to 2-NPs (Figure 6c). When the reaction was carried
out at the same catalyst loading (0.5 mol %), full conversion of alkyne
was not observed using 2-NPs, indicating catalyst deactivation.
These results show that immobilization of molecular complexes onto
graphene lead to a more efficient catalysts, and that the kinetics
are not affected by diffusion problems.

Figure 6 Hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-butyne
with precatalysts (a) 2 (1 mol %), (b) 2-rGO (0.5 mol %), and (c) comparison
of alkyne conversion for both precatalyst.

The nature of the catalytic active species was further analyzed
by poisoning experiments using poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) as a scavenger
of Pd(II) molecular species and the Hg drop test as an scavenger of
Pd NPs (Figure S27).61−66 The reactions were performed using precatalyst 2 (1.0
mol %) and 1-phenyl-1-butyne as the substrate. The results showed
that in the presence of P4VP, the hydrogenation rate is affected but
not inhibited and after the addition of Hg, the reaction immediately
stopped. Partial poisoning experiments suggest that the catalytic
active palladium species are heterogeneous in nature and confirm that
the active catalytic species are 2-NPs and 2-rGO-NPs. Then, we performed a Maitlis hot filtration test to support preliminary
data in the formation of NPs.67 In the
hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-pentyne with precatalyst 2, after 1 h reaction (GC conversion 40%), half of the reaction mixture
was filtered off through celite at 65 °C. The filtrate was maintained
for 5 h under identical conditions, but the GC analysis indicated
that no further hydrogenation occurred (GC conversion 40%). On the
contrary, the remaining mixture achieved full conversion in 2 h reaction.
This experiment reinforces the heterogeneous nature of the catalytic
active species.

An interesting topic to address in supported
catalysis is the influence
of the support. The support may only act as a medium that holds the
active catalyst or may also play a role during the catalytic reaction
facilitating the conversion of reagents into products.68−71 We explored the influence of the rGO support on palladium NPs during
hydrogenation. The experiment consisted of the monitoring of the reaction
profile in the hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1-butyne with precatalyst 2, the hybrid material 2-rGO, and a mixture of
molecular complex 2 with rGO for simulating the material 2-rGO (Figure 7). In all cases, we observed an induction period corresponding to
the formation of NPs. The results revealed that precatalyst 2 did not afford full conversion, and the reaction was stopped
after 15.5 h. There is catalyst deactivation because of a lack of
stability of 2-NPs under the reaction conditions. In
the case of the hybrid material 2-rGO, full conversion
of alkyne was achieved in 2.3 h indicating again that rGO plays a
role in the stabilization of 2-NPs. More interesting
results were obtained by the mixture of catalyst 2 with
rGO. The catalytic activity of the mixture is as high as the hybrid
material 2-rGO. The catalytic properties of complex 2 significantly increased after the addition of rGO. These
results support that the graphene plays an important role during the
catalytic experiment in the stabilization of palladium NPs and avoids
deactivation.

0.5 mol
% based on palladium. H2 pressure of 1 bar, Cs2CO3 (10 mol %) in toluene at 65 °C.

Precatalysts 2 and 2-rGO are active in
the hydrogenation of different substrates at low hydrogen pressure
and short reaction times (Table 1). Internal alkynes were rapidly semihydrogenated to
the corresponding alkenes with good to excellent stereoselectivity
toward the Z isomer (Table 1, entries 1–8). We have not observed
isomerization or migration of the Z-alkenes. Prolonged
reaction time produced the hydrogenation of the alkenes to the corresponding
alkanes. The complete reaction monitoring profiles are in the Supporting Information (Figures S29–S40).
The reactions are sequential and can be stopped at the appropriate
time in the formation of alkene or alkane. Terminal alkynes react
equally well but tend to give lower chemoselectivity at high conversions
(Table 1, entries 9–12).
We noted that by performing hydrogenations using 0.5 mol % of catalyst 2, the reaction stopped at ca. 50%. On the contrary, using
0.5 mol % of catalyst 2-rGO affords quantitative yields
in short reaction times. As we have previously observed, the immobilization
of precatalyst 2 onto graphene plays a role in the catalytic
process. The graphene does not act as a mere support. The immobilization
of palladium complexes onto graphene helps in the stabilization of
the catalytic active species and allows the reduction of catalyst
loading.

We
performed competitive experiments to further evaluate the selectivity
properties of precatalysts 2 and 2-rGO.
The competitive studies were carried out monitoring the hydrogenation
reaction of alkynes in the presence of substrates containing ketone,
nitrile, and nitro groups. In the alkyne/ketone experiment, 1-phenyl-1-butyne
was mixed with acetophenone in equimolar amounts. Reaction monitoring
using precatalysts 2 and 2-rGO showed a
complete conversion of alkyne without ketone hydrogenation. Similar
results were obtained in the case of alkyne/nitrile experiment using
benzonitrile as a substrate. Competition experiments show that hydrogenation
of alkynes tolerates the presence of nitriles and ketones (Figure S28). Different results were obtained
using the molecular complex 2 or the supported 2-rGO in the competitive experiment alkyne/nitrobenzene. The
hydrogenation reaction of 1-phenyl-1-butyne in the presence of nitrobenzene
using precatalyst 2 was completely unselective. After
2 h reaction, the presence of aniline was already observed, and the
alkyne was not completely hydrogenated even after 20 h reaction. On
the contrary, for the same experiment but using precatalyst 2-rGO, we observed complete alkyne hydrogenation after 3 h
reaction. The nitrobenzene was not hydrogenated and remained constant
after 20 h reaction (Figure 8). These results suggest that the active catalytic species
are different in nature for 2 or 2-rGO.

in the presence equimolar amount of nitrobenzene using (a) 2 (1 mol %) and (b) 2-rGO (0.5 mol %). Nitrobenzene is
not hydrogenated when using precatalyst 2-rGO.

Recycling
The
main advantage of immobilization of 2 onto the surface
of graphene is to recover and reuse the
catalyst in multiple runs. Catalyst stability and recycling properties
of the hybrid material 2-rGO (0.5 mol %) were tested
using 1-phenyl-1-butyne as the substrate, dry toluene as the solvent
(2 mL), Cs2CO3 as the base (10 mol %), and H2 (1 bar) and anisole as the internal standard. In the first
run, we observed an induction period of 30 min, and the reaction was
stopped after 1 h and was analyzed by GC. At this point, we observed
91% of alkyne conversion, 86% alkene yield with good selectivity
toward Z-alkene (Z/E, 90:10), and low over-reduction (9%). The solid precatalyst 2-rGO that is converted into the catalytic active species 2-rGO-NPs during the induction period was removed from the
solution by decantation washed with toluene and reused with the addition
of fresh substrate, solvent, H2 and anisole. In the next
runs, we did not observe an induction period and the reaction was
stopped after 1 h. The catalytic active species are formed in the
first run and are stabilized by the support. In the absence of the
graphene support (precatalyst 2), the catalytic active
species are not stabilized, and the catalytic system could not be
recycled. The hybrid material 2-rGO was reused up to
10 times without observing a decrease in activity (Figure 9a). The palladium amount in
the filtrate for each run was analyzed by ICP/MS. The results revealed
no significant palladium content, indicating the absence of palladium
leaching. This result was confirmed by analyzing the palladium content
in 2-rGO after the 10th run. Digestion of the solid catalyst
and ICP/MS analysis revealed that only 10 wt % of the initial palladium
amount is lost by leaching during the 10 recycling experiments. The
stereoselectivity toward the Z-isomer and the over-reduction
alkane product are maintained constant for each run within the experimental
error. These results show that immobilization of 2 onto
graphene leads to a robust catalytic hybrid material that is highly
recyclable.

(d) and run 10 (i).

To rationalize the formation
and evolution of palladium active
species, we analyzed the nature of the hybrid material 2-rGO in the recycling experiment. A small sample of the solid catalyst
was taken after selected runs and was analyzed by HRTEM and XPS (Figure 9). HRTEM images confirmed
the presence of palladium NPs in all catalytic runs. In the first
run, the particle size histogram shows a narrow distribution, and
the average size of the Pd NPs is 3.54 ± 1.03 nm (n = 236) (Figure 9d).
After 10 runs, the histogram shows a broader particle size distribution
and a slight increase in the size of Pd NPs (Figure 9i). The average size of Pd NPs after 10 catalytic
runs is 6.62 ± 2.80 nm (n = 282). These observations
suggest that Pd NPs suffer slight changes under subsequent catalytic
reactions. XPS analysis confirmed that the palladium NPs are composed
of Pd(2+) and Pd(0) oxidation states. These palladium NPs are decorated
by the presence of NHC and Br– ligands on the surface.72−76 XPS analysis confirms the presence of these ligands by the assignment
of peaks corresponding to the N (400.6 eV) and the Br (68.6 eV). We
have observed that the Pd(2+)/Pd(0) ratio is not constant for all
of the recycling runs, indicating that both size and composition of
the Pd-NPs vary during the catalytic experiment. The amount of Pd(2+)
decreases from run 1 to run 10, meanwhile the amount of Pd(0) increases.
These results suggest that Pd-NPs contain Pd(2+) at the surface and
Pd(0) at the core. An increase of the size of the NPs produces a decrease
of the specific area and consequently decreases the amount of Pd(2+).
This increase of the size of Pd-NPs is also observed in the size histograms
built by analyzing 236 and 282 NPs for run 1 and run 10, respectively
(Figure 9d,i). The
size and composition of Pd-NPs vary under catalytic conditions showing
a dynamic exchange and in consequence a different ratio of Pd(2+)/Pd(0)
oxidation states. There are precedents of dynamic exchange of metal
NPs caused by catalytic transformations.77−81

Palladium NPs were further characterized by
spherical aberration
(Cs)-corrected scanning TEM (STEM), using
a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. This mode is highly
advantageous over conventional TEM as the contrast is dependent on
the atomic number of the elements; therefore, heavier atoms will appear
much brighter in the images, helping to visualize the metallic species.
Samples corresponding to runs 1 and 10 were selected for the evaluation
of their morphology and to characterize the evolution of the palladium
NPs during the catalytic experiments. The Cs-corrected STEM data showed the presence of small crystalline palladium
NPs (Figure 10). Pd
units were found in the form of icosahedral (Ih) or fcc NPs in runs
1–10.82−84 In addition to these entities, bright spots were
identified all over the carbon support, which corresponded to cesium
in the form of individual atoms (Figure S26). We have not observed the formation of other catalytic active species
such as single palladium atoms or clusters. The Pd-NPs immobilized
on the surface of rGO maintained the original crystalline form after
the catalytic experiments. The supports provide a stabilizing effect
and allow recycling and reusing the catalytic active species.

one catalytic cycle (a–c) and 10 catalytic
cycles (d–f). Zooming of the Pd(0) NPs show the fcc crystal
nature of some of the NPs (b,e) and the icosahedral (Ih) structures
(c,f).

Conclusions
Palladium
NPs (Pd-NPs) supported on the surface of rGO have been
synthesized by decomposition of well-defined organometallic palladium
complexes. NHC ligands avoid particle agglomeration by coordination
to the surface. XPS analysis reveals that Pd-NPs contain palladium
in two oxidation states [Pd(2+) and Pd(0)] and confirm the presence
of the ligands (NHC and Br). For comparative purposes, Pd-NPs without
the support were synthesized starting from the same organometallic
complexes. Characterization by XPS analysis shows similar composition
for these NPs in terms of ligands and palladium oxidation states.
The catalytic properties in the hydrogenation of alkynes have been
evaluated using the free and supported palladium NPs. The results
clearly indicate that immobilization of palladium NPs onto rGO improves
the catalytic properties in terms of activity and selectivity. The
palladium NPs composition shows a dynamic process during the recycling
experiments, and different amounts of Pd(2+) and Pd(0) oxidation states
were observed. The support plays a role in the catalytic performance
by the stabilization of palladium NPs.

Synthesis of 2-rGO
A suspension of 180
mg of rGO in 100 mL of CH2Cl2 was introduced
in an ultrasounds bath for 30 min. Then, complex 2 (25
mg, 0,032 mmol) was added to the mixture. The suspension was stirred
at room temperature for 16 h. The black solid was isolated by filtration
and washed with CH2Cl2 (2 × 15 mL) affording
the hybrid material as a black solid. The exact amount of supported
complex was determined by ICP/MS analysis. The results accounted for
a 5.5 wt % of complex 2 in the hybrid material 2-rGO.

Synthesis of 2-NPs
A Schlenk flask equipped
with a stirring bar was charged with a solution of 2 (30
mg, 0.038 mmol) in toluene (2 mL) and Cs2CO3 (22 mg, 0.067 mmol). A balloon of H2 (1 bar) was connected
to the Schlenk, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 65 °C
for 3 h. After this time, the black solid formed was recovered by
centrifugation, washed with toluene, and dried (11 mg). 2-NPs were analyzed by TEM and XPS.

Synthesis of 2-rGO-NPs
A Schlenk flask
equipped with a stirring bar was charged with 2-rGO (30
mg), Cs2CO3 (17 mg, 0.052 mmol), and toluene
(2 mL). A balloon of H2 (1 bar) was connected to the Schlenk,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 3 h. After
this time, 2-rGO-NPs were recovered by centrifugation,
washed with toluene, and dried (32 mg). 2-rGO-NPs were
analyzed by TEM, XPS, TG, UV/vis, and Raman spectroscopy.

General Procedure for the Catalytic Hydrogenation of Alkynes
In a general catalytic experiment, a 10 mL Schlenk equipped with
a stirring bar is charged with 0.3 mmol of alkyne, base (Cs2CO3, 10 mol %) and catalyst, and 2 mL of dry toluene as
the solvent. A balloon full of H2 is connected to the Schlenk.
The Schlenk is then introduced in a preheated 65 °C oil bath.
Yields and conversions were determined by GC or 1H NMR
analysis using anisole or 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard.
