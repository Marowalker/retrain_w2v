Molecular
selective adsorption processes at the solid surface of
biopolymers in mixed solvent systems are poorly understood due to
manifold interactions. However, the ability to achieve adsorptive
fractionation of liquid mixtures is posited to relate to the role
of specific solid–liquid interactions at the adsorbent interface.
The hydration of solid biopolymers (amylose, amylopectin, cellulose)
in binary aqueous systems is partly governed by the relative solvent
binding affinities with the biopolymer surface sites, in accordance
with the role of textural and surface chemical properties. While molecular
models that account for the surface area and solvent effects provide
reliable estimates of hydration energy and binding affinity parameters,
spectroscopic and thermal methods offer a facile alternative experimental
approach to account for detailed aspects of solvation phenomena at
biopolymer interfaces that involve solid−liquid adsorption.
In this report, thermal and spectroscopic methods were used to understand
the interaction of starch- and cellulose-based materials in water–ethanol
(W–E) binary mixtures. Batch adsorption studies in binary W–E
mixtures reveal the selective solvent uptake properties by the biomaterials,
in agreement with their solvent swelling in pure water or ethanol.
The nature, stability of the bound water, and the thermodynamic properties
of the biopolymers in variable hydration states were probed via differential
scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy. The trends in biopolymer–solvent
interactions are corroborated by dye adsorption and scanning electron
microscopy, indicating that biopolymer adsorption properties in W–E
mixtures strongly depend on the surface area, pore structure, and
accessibility of the polar surface groups of the biopolymer systems,
in agreement with the solvent-selective uptake results reported herein.

Introduction
Hydration phenomena
in heterogeneous systems at solid–liquid
interfaces play a key role in physical and biophysical processes in
condensed media.1 In general, hydration
phenomena influence the thermodynamics of supramolecular complex formation
and self-assembly in fields such as bio-catalysis,2,3 protein
folding,4 drug delivery systems,5 and macromolecule-based chemical separations.6 Biopolymer adsorbent technology that utilize
starch and cellulose (CE) has gained increasing attention due to its
relative abundance, low-cost, and low energy inputs with minimal infrastructure
requirements for adsorptive-based fractionation.7 In a previous study,8,9 we reported the unique
adsorption-based fractionation of water (W) from binary mixtures of
water and ethanol (W–E) using biopolymer sorbents and their
modified forms. Elsewhere, we reported on the unique adsorption of
water vapor using starch biopolymer adsorbents.10,11 In condensed media, the adsorptive fractionation of solvents and
organic mixtures using biopolymers such as starch and cellulose encompasses
variable solute–solute (s–s), solute–solvent
(s–l), and solvent–solvent (l–l) interactions.9,12,13 In a recent isotherm study of
starch–water vapor systems,10 the
importance of biopolymer–solvent (s–l) interactions
was shown by markedly different thermodynamic properties of starch-based
adsorbents. By comparison, the heterogeneous fractionation of water
from W–E binary solutions using starch- and cellulose-based
adsorbents was reported8,9,14−16 that extends beyond the pioneering work of Ladisch
and Dyck.17 However, there is a limited
molecular-level understanding of the factors that govern hydration
and solvent-selective fractionation in solid-solution (s–l)
sorption processes, especially for native and modified (cross-linked)
biopolymer systems.9,18,19 This knowledge gap limits the rational design and utilization of
biopolymers for applications such as advanced drug delivery and industrial-scale
chemical separations.

Numerous reports have applied theoretical
and experimental techniques
to investigate solvent–solvent interactions20,21 and biopolymer hydration.22 It is also
noteworthy that the subject of hydration from the viewpoint of solution
chemistry and chemical physics is an expansive and complex field of
research.23−25 In particular, the field has elicited a heated debate
and stimulated investigations of solvent–solvent interactions,
which is beyond the scope of the current work. In the case of s–l
interactions, the present work is focused on biopolymer solvation
processes in the context of s–l adsorption processes. While
the adsorption phenomena of this type involve an ensemble of interactions,
the relative affinities of solvent with the active surface sites of
the solid-phase biopolymer is the focus herein.26 Although, a molecular-level understanding of biopolymer
adsorption processes is limited in heterogeneous s–l systems,8,9 solvent swelling22 of native and modified
biopolymers in mixed solvents indicates that variable solvent-selective
adsorption occurs. Greater solvent-selective adsorption occurs for
biopolymers that were incrementally cross-linked with epichlorohydrin,
where the effect was assigned to changes in the hydrophile–lipophile
balance (HLB) of the biopolymer.13 Thus,
it is posited that the role of surface accessible functional groups
play a key role in solvent–solute interactions, where changes
to the Gibbs surface energy of the system depend on the textural properties
of the adsorbent system. Models that incorporate surface area and
solvent effects provide reliable estimates of hydration energy and
binding affinity that may account for hydration phenomena in structurally
well-defined macromolecular systems.1,27 By contrast,
a complementary approach that employs experimental methods such as
spectroscopy (Fourier-transform infrared, NMR, and Raman) and thermal
analysis (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC) techniques offer
a facile alternative for the study of biopolymer solvation in materials
with complex tertiary structures.28−30 Collectively, these
techniques enable a detailed study of interactions in biopolymer–solvent
(s–l) systems with consideration of the biopolymer morphology,
thermal, swelling, and rheological properties that complement a large
body of research in this field.28−30

Herein, we report a multi-instrumental
approach for the study of
the adsorption properties of cellulose (CE) and several starch biopolymers
derived from corn and maize that contain variable amylose (AM) and
amylopectin (AP) contents in the presence of binary solvent mixtures.
The starch materials herein include high AP maize starch (98% AP,
2% AM), soluble corn starch (50% AM/AP), and high AM starch (98% AM,
2% AP). These biopolymers are denoted as AP, AM50, and AM, respectively
(cf. Table 1). The
objectives of the current study are manifold: (1) to characterize
the textural and surface properties of the biopolymers, (2) to study
the fractionation properties of water in W–E binary mixtures,
and (3) to understand the molecular-level details of biopolymer solvation
in s–l systems with a focus on biopolymer–solvent adsorptive
processes. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and related imaging
methods provide information on the biopolymer morphology and textural
properties. A dye-based adsorption method with phenolphthalein (phth)
was employed, where the degree of phth decolorization in the presence
of polysaccharides provides an assessment of the biopolymer hydroxyl
(−OH) group accessibility. The biopolymer–solvent-selective
uptake properties were investigated using batch adsorption and solvent
swelling studies in neat water (W) and ethanol (E), where trends in
W–E uptake is understood on the basis of differences in adsorptive
affinity due to the variation in the textural and surface properties
of the biopolymer materials.

The unique solvent
selectivity/uptake of such adsorbents in W,
E, and mixed W–E solvents with variable composition provides
an avenue to establish a molecular-level understanding of the biopolymer–solvent
adsorption process. Accompanying processes such as l–l and
s–l interactions can be inferred from DSC and Raman spectroscopy
results. The present study contributes to an understanding of the
role of hydration phenomena at solid biopolymer interfaces and provides
further insight into the molecular-level process of solvent fractionation
in W–E mixtures via a complementary experimental approach.
The role of biopolymer solvation is a topic of continued interest
due to the utilization and design of improved biopolymer materials
for green chemistry and sustainable industrial processing. The present
research is expected to catalyze further developments in these areas
that employ platform biomaterials such as starch and cellulose because
of their natural abundance, along with their unique structure and
interfacial properties. Biomaterials will play an ever-increasing
role in the future, especially in diverse applications as functional
coatings for energy storage and exchange,10 biocatalyst supports, advanced drug delivery, and solid-phase extraction
(SPE) materials for food processing and environmental remediation.2−8

Results
As indicated above, spectral and thermal characterization
of solid-phase
starch and cellulose polymers in solvent systems are described below,
along with the corresponding solvent swelling and adsorption properties
in condensed media.

Characterization of Biopolymers
Starch is a semi-crystalline
biopolymer linked by α(1 → 4) and α(1 →
6) glycosidic bonds that contain linear (amylose; AM) and branched
(amylopectin; AP) oligomers (cf. Figure 1a,b), respectively.31,32 Cellulose (cf. Figure 1c) contains β(1 → 4) glycosidic bonds with greater rigidity
over starch, and variable crystallinity due to the extensive intra-
and inter-molecular H-bonding between the neighboring glucopyranose
monomer units and cellulose chains.33,34 This unique
H-bonding of cellulose leads to the supramolecular self-assembly of
its polymer strands to aggregate into micro- and macro-fibril structures.34,35 The structural variability of starch and cellulose affects the textural
(pore size distribution and surface area) properties and surface accessible
functional groups of these biopolymers.

amylose and (b) branched amylopectin starches, and (c) cellulose fibers
formed from inter- (black lines) and intra-molecularly (white lines)
H-bonded strands.

Textural Properties
Textural properties (porosity and
surface area) play a key role in determining the relative accessibility
of the active sorption sites of the biopolymer materials and their
subsequent s–l interactions in binary mixtures. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy provide important
structural information regarding the morphology and pore structure
of biopolymers.36 Herein, the SEM images
for AP, AM50, AM, and CE are shown in Figure 2. The starch-based materials (AP, AM50, and
AM) possess distinct particle grain shape and size that vary from
large to small, and oval to irregular, with a variable diameter (ca.
5–50 μm). The SEM results for AP reveal the evidence
of the pore structure, whereas AM50 and AM have relatively smooth
surface features, nearly devoid of pores.37 The SEM result for CE reveals the quaternary fibril structure of
the biopolymer, as noted by the textural features in Figure 2d. While the SEM results provide
useful structural insight into the morphology of biopolymers, there
is a need to account for the role of solvent effects due to the amphiphilic
nature of such biopolymers. The role of solvent on the biopolymer
structure is supported by the unique rheological behavior of starch
at variable concentrations.27

for the native starches (a–c) and cellulose
(d) biopolymers.

Surface Chemical Properties
The surface accessible
functional groups and dipolar character of biopolymers are important
aspects that govern their structure and hydration properties. The
surface accessibility of the −OH groups of the biopolymers
was estimated using a dye-based method with phenolphthalein (phth)
as a probe,38 based on the decolorization
effect of phth upon complex formation with polysaccharides at an alkaline
pH39 (cf. Figure S1). The extent of dye decolorization in the presence of biopolymers
generally correlates with the relative accessibility of the −OH
groups, where the formation of an optically transparent biopolymer–phth
complex is the result of a pKa shift of
bound phth relative to its unbound form.37Figure 3 illustrates
the decolorization results obtained from the adsorption profile of
phth in the saturation region of the isotherm at a fixed biopolymer
dosage (ca. 30 mg). The relative dye decolorization for the biopolymers
are listed in descending order: AM > AM50 > AP ≫ CE,
according
to the relative absorbance change (ΔAbs) observed in Figure 3. The results indicate
greater −OH accessible sites for AM, and the least accessibility
for CE. It is worth mentioning that ca. 30% of the −OH groups
for CE are accessible based on the relative peak intensity of CE with
respect to AM, in agreement with an independent study.12

(phth). Inset: structure of the ionized form of the phth dye probe.

Swelling and Uptake Properties
Variable solvent swelling
relates to the solvation of biopolymers that ultimately influence
their properties in applications such as controlled-release delivery
systems40,41 and adsorptive fractionation.42 The thermodynamics of the solvent uptake by
biopolymer adsorbents can be partly related to surface interactions
that vary according to the textural and surface chemical properties
of the materials. Solvent swelling encompasses solvent–solvent
(l–l) and biopolymer–solvent (s–l) interactions
since it is a sorption (adsorption + absorption) process. By contrast,
isotherm parameters (Qm, ns) in Table 2 relate to adsorption phenomena that may be ascribed mainly to biopolymer–solvent
(s–l) interactions. The solvent swelling [SW–E (%)] for biopolymers imbibed in neat water
and ethanol (Table 2) provide evidence that selective solvent uptake occurs, especially
when absorption processes prevail. Similar to the dye decolorization
results, the solvent swelling generally increases with the amylose
content, whereas CE shows unique swelling in water, as follows: AM
(250) > CE (170) > AM50 (160) > AP (153). The trends in solvent
swelling
are in agreement with the results for monolayer water uptake capacity
for biopolymers (Qm) in binary W–E
mixtures (cf. Table 2) where CE (1.6) > AM (0.61) > AM50 (0.20) ≈ AP (0.21).9 The offset in the Qm values in Table 2 for water and ethanol uptake with the biopolymers is accounted for
by the differences in the dielectric constant and molar volumes of
each solvent listed in Table 1 (vide infra).

Solvent–Biopolymer Interactions in
Mixed Solvents
The solvation properties of biopolymers (AP,
AM50, AM, and CE) were
further examined using DSC and Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction
with the textural and surface chemical properties described above.
It should be noted that the preparation of solvated biopolymer (solid–liquid)
samples enable a study of biopolymer–solvent interactions.
One exception is for the case of solvent swelling measurements since
this method involves sorption, as noted above. The use of adsorption
isotherm models and complementary methods (Raman spectroscopy and
DSC) in neat W or E, and mixed W–E systems affords further
insight into the primary role of biopolymer–solvent and secondary
role of solvent–solvent interactions.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC provides unique
complementary information on the state of biopolymer solvation and
s–l interactions by monitoring the trends in endotherm profiles
for vaporization (ΔHvap). DSC has
been widely used to study the thermal properties of starch materials,
following the seminal work of Steven and Elton.43 The use of DSC for the study of the hydration properties
of functional materials was recently reviewed,22,44 where starch and its modified forms display notably complex thermal
behavior.22,45 In spite of the structural complexity of
bound water at such biopolymer surfaces, DSC can be used to probe
the thermodynamic state of the bound solvent in biopolymers. It follows
that the adsorbent–solvent (s–l) interactions from calorimetry
can be evaluated to afford molecular-level interpretations of such
processes as noted for hydrated mineral oxides.46 In particular, the unique thermal properties of starch
(amylose and amylopectin) and cellulose in their solvated state in
water–ethanol mixtures are expected to differ due to the structural
variation among these biopolymers. For instance, the nature of biopolymer–solvent
(s–l) interactions can be inferred based on thermal events
related to adsorbed solvent, since free, weakly/strongly bound, and
desorbed water reveals unique DSC profiles with variable heat flow,
intensity, and temperature shifts.47

In Figure 4a–d,
the DSC thermograms reveal dehydration and gelatinization endotherms
for biopolymer (s–l) systems with a variable W–E content
over the 30–140 °C range. The relative stability of the
bound water is greatest for CE (Figure 4d) and least for AM (c), as follows: CE > AP ≥
AM50 > AM. This stability profile was inferred from the full-width
at half-maximum (FWHM) resultsf or the Raman data (cf. Table S1) and the DSC dehydration transition
temperatures in Figure 4. Starch materials with a higher amylose content (AM and AM50; Figure 4b,c) have greater
affinity for water, as evidenced by a wide thermal transition range
(40–140 °C) for the observed endotherms. By contrast,
a narrow thermal range (ca. 80–120 °C; Figure 4a,d) occurs for high amylopectin
(AP) starch and cellulose CE, in accordance with their known hydrophobic
character. Furthermore, the ΔHvap varies among the biomaterials in neat W versus neat E, suggesting
that solvation effects depend on the nature of solvent (vide infra).
The foregoing provides support that variable solute–solvent
(s–l) binding affinity occurs among the various biopolymer
systems.

Figure 4 Differential scanning calorimetry results for various biopolymer
materials; (a) AP, (b) AM50, (c) AM, and (d) CE, with a variable water–ethanol
content.

The variable s–l interactions
may be accounted for by differences
in the textural and surface chemical properties of the materials as
described in the sections below.

Raman Spectroscopy
The nature of biopolymer hydration
in W–E binary mixtures was probed using Raman spectroscopy,
because the spectral intensity of various Raman signatures are known
to be sensitive to changes in the microenvironment. This effect results
due to the changes in polarization and solute–solute/solute–solvent
non-covalent interactions of macromolecules in s−l systems.48 In particular, the relatively low scattering
cross-section of water aide in the study of hydrated biopolymers using
Raman spectroscopy. Figure 5 illustrates the Raman spectral results of various solid-phase
biopolymers imbibed with variable levels of solvent (W or E) over
the spectral region between 2200 and 3200 cm–1.
The bound water fraction contains D2O (10% w/w), where
the line-width/-shape of the uncoupled oscillator HOD Raman bands
is variable and relates to the microenvironment effects due to contributions
assigned to bound (l–l or s–l) and free water.49,50

Figure 5 Raman
spectra of the biopolymer materials in W–E solvent
systems containing D2O (10% w/w), where the relative water–ethanol
(%W & E) content is shown.

The Raman spectra in Figure 5 are dominated by vibrational bands at ∼2900
cm–1, where polysaccharides typically display strong
C-H
stretching bands at ∼2800–3000 cm–1 with broad O–H bands at ∼3100–3600 cm–1.51,52 In the case of the Raman spectra of W–E
mixtures, the solvent O–H band appears ca. 3000–3400
cm–153 and the observed
C-H stretching bands (ca. 2900 cm–1) relate to combined
vibrational contributions from both starch and ethanol that vary with
the composition of the mixed (W–E) solvent. The C-H band at
2900 cm–1 shows subtle red/blue Raman shifts up
to ∼15 cm–1, which indicate that the microenvironment
effects are evident at variable W–E content. While the Raman
scattering cross-section of H2O is low, the use of 10%
D2O/H2O mixtures yields a band assigned to the
HOD uncoupled oscillator (∼2500 cm–1) for
water. The spectral features (intensity, FWHM, and shift) of this
band are summarized in Table S1 in the
Supporting Information (SI). The intensity of the HOD band for the
biopolymers increase as the water content increases from 25 to 75%.
In general, the observed Raman shifts (∼15 cm–1) do not follow a well-defined trend among the biopolymer systems.
However, the starch materials with a greater amylose content (i.e.,
AM and AM50) have somewhat greater FWHM values with larger Raman shifts
(cf. Figure 5 and Table S1 in SI) compared to AP and CE.

Discussion
The results from the complementary thermal (DSC) and Raman data
above reveal interesting molecular-level details regarding solute–solvent
(s–l) interactions in W–E binary mixtures. In particular,
the DSC trends for the thermal stability of the bound ethanol are
listed as: CE > AP > AM50 > AM. By comparison, a reversed
trend of
the biopolymer affinity to water is given as follows: AM > AM50
>
AP > CE. The above trends can be related to the biopolymer textural
and surface chemical properties consonant with interactions anticipated
with hydrophilic and apolar domains of the respective biopolymers.
The microporous character and apolar domains of CE and AP is supported
by the SEM, DSC, and dye decolorization results above. The unique
tertiary structure for each biopolymer provides an account of the
characteristic water adsorption and swelling properties for these
biopolymers. For example, water can be enclathrated within the amorphous
and hydrophobic domains of AP and CE to a greater extent than AM,
since the latter likely undergoes s–l hydrogen bonding interactions
with accessible −OH groups of the biopolymer, in accordance
with the key role of H-bonding lattice interactions for AM and AM50
in the solid “dry” state. The trends in water swelling
(AM > CE > AM50 > AP) and monolayer water adsorption (CE
> AM > AM50
> AP) properties among the biopolymers differ in accordance with
textural
and surface chemical properties. The trends in solvent swelling suggest
that the factors vary due to the differing role of surface adsorption
versus absorption energetics among the biopolymers. The forces may
include capillary condensation (absorption or enclathration) within
the pores of the biopolymer, even at apolar sites, as well as dipolar
interactions with surface functional −OH groups (adsorption).
The broader DSC endotherm transitions for high amylose starches (AM
and AM50) relate to their greater propensity to adsorb water, consistent
with the high swelling values listed in Table 2. The affinity of AM and AM50 for water parallels
other reports that describe the reactivity of starch granules with
enzymatic reagents,36,37,54 in accordance with greater surface accessibility of active sites
at the quaternary structural level of starch. AM and AM50 have greater
surface accessible −OH groups for H-bonding due to their linear
morphology (cf. Figure 1a and Scheme 1a).
In contrast, AP and CE are characterized by branched or double helical
(Scheme 1b) and fibril
structures (Scheme 1c), respectively. The surface accessible −OH functional groups
of CE was estimated at 30% (cf. Figure 3), where its greater water uptake relative to AP (cf. Table 2) relates to its variable
HLB character, arising due to its unique quaternary fibril structure.44 The properties of CE are contrasted with starch
biopolymers that possess greater hydrophile character and conformational
lability. The narrow DSC endotherms at higher temperatures (for AP
and CE) are in agreement with the greater stability of the bound water,
in accordance with the microporous structure and apolar domains of
these biopolymers. It is worth noting that the DSC endotherm profiles
of starch shift to higher temperature as the AP content increases,
AP > AM50 > AM, in agreement with the unique thermal properties
of
linear versus branched starches.55−58 Starch materials that contain
a greater AP content display higher dehydration temperatures and enthalpic
changes due to greater chain entanglement and s–s adhesive
interactions over AM starches.55−57 The lower melting (gelatinization)
temperature of AM starch is supported by its reduced crystallinity.58 In general, higher enthalpy values in Figure 4 correlate with its
greater water content (75% water). By contrast, the endotherm events
for the biopolymer–solvent systems (s–l) in W–E
mixtures ca. 80 °C relate to ethanol vaporization (ΔHvap), in agreement with its normal boiling point
(cf. Table 1). It is
worthwhile to note from the DSC results that secondary l–l
interactions can be indirectly inferred from the trends for the dehydration
endotherms of the biomaterials in neat W or E, and at 50–50
W–E content (wt %). The variable trends for the biopolymers
suggest that hydrophobic hydration may act synergistically for hydrophilic
(AM and AM50) biopolymers or competitively for hydrophobic (AP and
CE) biopolymers upon imbibing in mixed and neat solvents.

of Starch, Showing Intra- and Inter-Molecular Hydrogen Bonding Interactions
In the case of the Raman spectral
results, the trends in the shifts
of the uncoupled OD vibrations and the FWHM are inferred to relate
to the nature of intermolecular H-bonding of adsorbed solvent for
the biopolymer–solvent (s–l) systems.49,50,59 Similar to the DSC results, the OD bands
for AM and AM50 starch systems display a broader appearance with red
shifts relative to AP and CE.

The Raman results for the HOD
bands with variable FWHM and intensity
indicate a greater level of adsorbed water in the biopolymer–solvent
ensemble that adopts weakly- versus strongly-bound water for AM and
CE, respectively. Relative to bulk water, AM and AM50 are characterized
by microenvironments with weakly-bound water due to surface binding
(s–l). By contrast, AP and CE reveal attenuated OD bands with
a reduced FWHM. The Raman results provide evidence of highly ordered
water for AP and CE due to the propensity of greater H-bonding within
the micropore and fibril domains, due to the properties that are similar
to bulk water (l–l). This is in agreement with the narrow DSC
gelatinization/dehydration endotherms in Figure 4. The micropore networks in these biopolymers
are supported by their unique morphology as revealed by the SEM results
(cf. Figure 2). Thus,
variable H-bonding occurs for AP and CE due to adsorbed versus absorbed
water, as described above. The Raman spectra of hydration and bulk
water typically consist of three spectral components at ∼2400,
2500, and 2600, where the 2600 cm–1 band describes
nonhydrogen bonded water (OD).49 The broader
band widths for AM and AM50 may relate to the weakly-bound water in
the nonporous biopolymer domains, in agreement with the greater swelling
and gelation properties of the linear starches.

The ongoing
discussion of biopolymer–solvent (s–l)
interactions reveals that variable solvent swelling, surface uptake,
and affinity occurs in W–E systems due to several factors:
(1) the surface accessibility of the biopolymer functional groups,
(2) the overall biopolymer HLB, and (3) biopolymer textural
properties based on the values shown in Table 1 and the SEM results (Figure 2). High amylose starches (AM and AM50) adopt
a linear morphology that have more surface accessible −OH groups
for effective H-bonding. By contrast, high amylopectin (AP) and cellulose
have variable HLB due to reduced −OH accessibility, along with
pore domains that accounts for bound water within micropore sites.
In addition to the above factors, solvent physicochemical properties
for W and E may account for the variable uptake by the biopolymer
systems: (i) solvent dielectric constant (εW ≈
80; εE ≈ 24), (ii) solvent molar volume: Vm(W) = 18 cm3/mol and Vm(E) = 58 cm3/mol, and (iii) the structuredness
of the hydrogen bonding network of the solvent (three-dimensional
(3-D) for water versus two-dimensional (2-D) for ethanol). On the
basis of the foregoing considerations and those listed in Table 1, water is more adaptive
at forming stable hydrogen bonded clusters and hydration shells based
on its smaller size, large dielectric constant, where the 3-D network
of water over the 2-D ethanol solvent60 parallels the large cohesive energy density and enclathration properties
of water. By contrast, the H-bond network of ethanol has greater 2-D
character with a propensity to form W–E or E–E clusters
due to favorable l–l interactions.20 According to the hydrophobic hydration of ethanol in water–ethanol
mixtures, water envelops ethanol in a clathrate-like configuration.61 The variable trends for hydrophobic hydration
of the biopolymers described herein arise due to differences in the
biopolymer–solvent (s–l) affinities in W–E systems,
in conjunction with the solvent physicochemical properties. The comparative
hydration properties of starch systems and cellulose in pure water
studied herein are conceptually illustrated in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Conceptualized View of Hydrated Biopolymers:
(a) Amylose, (b) Amylopectin,
and (c) Cellulose in Pure Water
The
degree of swelling of the
respective biopolymers in water is denoted by the yellow spheres on
the right.

Conclusions
The adsorption properties
of the various starch- and cellulose-based
biopolymers (AP, AM50, AM, and CE) were studied using DSC, Raman spectroscopy,
SEM, and solvent swelling in neat/mixed water–ethanol (W–E)
solvents. The swelling of the biopolymers in neat solvents was greater
for high amylose (AM) and soluble starch (AM50) due to the flexible
nature of the biopolymer backbone and greater surface accessibility
of the hydroxyl groups. The flexible starch biopolymers (AM and AM50)
have limited SA and pore structure due to efficient packing in the
solid state. By contrast, the rigid fibril structure of cellulose
(CE) contributes permanent porosity with less solvent swelling, in
agreement with the SEM results.

The surface accessible biopolymer
−OH groups were estimated
by a dye decolorization method with phenolphthalein. Starch materials
possess greater accessibility over cellulose due to the unique structural
differences between each biopolymer. CE and AP show similar water
adsorption properties in accordance with their hydrophobic character
and biopolymer steric effects, as supported by dye adsorption, DSC,
and Raman results. High amylose (AM and AM50) and high amylopectin
(AP) starches differ in their hydrated state and HLB profile due to
variable branching, swelling, and hydrophobic effects. The unique
biopolymer–solvent interaction of CE in W–E relates
to its quaternary fibril structure and pore domains that account for
water uptake due to sorption (absorption + adsorption) processes.
Solvation of the biopolymer (s–l interactions) is influenced
by the physicochemical properties of the system as follows: (1) the
propensity of the biopolymer to undergo swelling, (2) functional group
accessibility of the biopolymer, and (3) the nature (size, polarity,
etc.) and composition of the solvent system. The complementary methods
reported herein provide further insight into the factors governing
biopolymer structure-function that relate to adsorption phenomena
in s–l systems. In turn, we envisage that the structure of
biopolymer sorbents can be modified in a controlled manner to yield
materials with tailored properties for applications in food production,
carrier devices, and as solid-phase extraction (SPE) materials for
environmental remediation.

Experimental Methods
Materials and Chemicals
Cellulose (CE) and starches
from various sources (corn or maize) containing variable amylose and
amylopectin contents were chosen as the biopolymer materials (cf. Table 1). All of the biopolymers
and ethanol (100% w/w) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville,
ON, Canada) and were used as received. Deionized Millipore water was
used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions. The selected physicochemical
properties of the polysaccharides and the solvent components are listed
in Table 1.

Solvent
Swelling Tests
The swelling properties of the
polysaccharides were measured using 20 mg of material equilibrated
in 7 mL of Millipore water or neat ethanol for 48 h. The degree of
swelling in water (SW) or ethanol (SE) for the biopolymers is determined using eq 1 as shown below, where Ws is the wet sample and Wd is the dry sample after oven drying at 60 °C. 1  

Phenolphthalein Decolorization Studies
The surface
accessibility of the biopolymer hydroxyl (−OH) groups was estimated
by the decolorization of phenolphthalein (phth) in aqueous solution
using a method described elsewhere.12,62,63 A 7 mL solution containing phth in NaHCO3 aqueous buffer at pH 10.5 was added to vials with variable sample
masses (1–10 mg) that were allowed to equilibrate with shaking
for 24 h at 295 K. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation
(Precision Micro-Semi Micro Centricone, Precision Scientific Co.)
of the solution mixture at 1550 rpm and the measurement of absorbance
was performed using a double beam spectrophotometer (Varian CARY 100)
at 295 ± 0.5 K and λmax of 552 nm.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC thermograms
were acquired from starch or cellulose samples that were equilibrated
with known amounts of water and ethanol solvents. A biopolymer (20
mg) was added to 4 dram glass vials containing 10 mL of solvent with
a variable water–ethanol (W–E) weight (%) content. The
sample vials were incubated by shaking (Poly Science, Dual Action
Shaker) for 24 h at 160 rpm at ambient pH and temperature to achieve
equilibrium. Thereafter, the samples were separated from the solutions
using a vacuum filter to obtain solvated solid (biopolymer–solvent)
samples for analysis by DSC. The samples were added to DSC pans and
sealed with a hole punched in the sample lid to allow for outgassing
of vapor during the heating cycle over the temperature range of 30–150
°C.

Raman Spectroscopy
The samples for Raman spectroscopy
were prepared as above (cf. DSC section), where the water content
was isotopically mixed with 10% (w/w) D2O/H2O. The hydrated biopolymer samples were isolated by centrifuging
(Precision Micro-Semi Micro Centricone, Precision Scientific Co.)
at 1800 rpm for 1 h to obtain solvated solid (biopolymer–solvent)
samples for further analysis.
