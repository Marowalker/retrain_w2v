The development and
widespread application of organic electronic
devices require the availability of simple and cost-effective suitable
materials. In this study, the preparation of a new class of conjugated
compounds on the basis of a dithienocyclohexanone (DTCH) core is reported.
Several synthetic strategies for the preparation of dialkyl DTCH derivatives
are explored, with special emphasis on the establishment of a sustainable
synthetic access. Two successful synthetic pathways, both consisting
of five steps, are identified: the first one featuring readily available
3-thiophenecarboxaldeyde and the second one 3-ethynylthiophene as
the starting materials. Both procedures are characterized by reasonably
high overall yields (over 30%) and remarkably low E factors (<400). Preliminary evidences of the use of such building
blocks in the micellar Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions
leading to promising molecular semiconductors are also given. Moreover,
on a small molecule containing DTCH moiety, solar cell performance
was investigated.

Introduction
Conjugated polymers1 play a fundamental
role both as active layer and/or interlayer in several plastic electronic
and optoelectronic devices, including new-generation photovoltaic
cells (OPVs), field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors,
sensors, and so forth. Mostly, polymeric materials are discussed focusing
on performances alone, even though the synthetic accessibility, cost
of raw materials, and ease of purification and processing are at least
as relevant on an industrial level as the absolute performance.2 Some of us have recently proposed a criterion
enabling to rank the synthetic complexity of both conjugated polymers3 and monodisperse low-molecular-weight molecules4 generally considered as suitable active materials
for the fabrication of organic solar cells. On doing so, we proposed
to take into account five parameters: (i) the number of synthetic
steps; (ii) the reaction yields; (iii) the number of unit operations
required for the isolation/purification of the intermediate compounds,
in particular (iv) the number of column chromatographic purifications;
and (v) the number of hazardous chemicals used for their preparation.
Alongside with synthetic complexity, it is worthwhile to take into
account—particularly when scaling up—the reaction E factor.5 Such number is defined
as kilograms of organic wastes produced for every kilogram of product. The pharmaceutical industry is
very familiar with this parameter and would accept only processes
characterized by E factor in the order of a few hundreds. On the contrary, the E factor is very seldom considered
in the OPV field, and the very few documented examples show E factor in tens of thousands of orders of magnitude.6 Minimizing both synthetic complexity and E factor ensures the establishment of a protocol that is
simple, hazard free, and sustainable.

The literature dedicated
to polymeric materials for OPV includes
hundreds of structurally very diverse polymers, discussed in several
review articles.7−15 Such vast database of polymers enabled the formulation of structure–property
relationships,16−26 eventually leading to the development of the now generally accepted
lead guideline of the donor–acceptor (D–A) concept.17,27−29 D–A conjugated copolymers feature alternating
electron-rich (“donor”) and electron-poor (“acceptor”)
monomer units and are known to exhibit a low energy gap and tunable
highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital energy levels, which is beneficial for light harvesting and
photoinduced electron transfer. The more common donor and acceptor
monomer units have been thoroughly reviewed.9,10,12,29

According
to efficiency alone, the best acceptor building blocks
are thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione30 and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione.31 The best donors mostly pertain to the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes32 class. Unfortunately, all of them feature relevant
synthetic complexity. The relative E factor is not available in the dedicated literature, but
because of the fact that column purifications involving halogenated
solvents are frequently mentioned, values would probably exceed industrial
requirements. In short, alongside the efforts to constantly raise
the record efficiency bar with whatever can be made, regardless of
the cost, it is still worthwhile to design simpler structures, potentially
accessible (and scalable) through sustainable approaches. In this
context, our groups have recently designed a novel class of monomers
on the basis of 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]cyclohexan-4-one (DTCH) (Figure 1).33

Figure 1 Structure of 5,5-dialkyl-5H-1,8-dithia-as-indacen-4-one
DTCH.

The structure differs from that of the more common, all-conjugated
benzo[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene already described
in the literature of OPV polymers34−38 and substantially consists of a 2,2′-bithiophene
moiety bearing both an electron-accepting group and a site for the
straightforward functionalization with orthogonal functionalization
chains, in a configuration nondissimilar to that of other performing
fluorene-related building blocks.39−41 The monomer itself has
a donor–acceptor character, due to the presence of both π-excessive
bithiophene and the electron-withdrawing ketone residue. This is,
to our knowledge, one of the few cases reported in the literature
of conjugated monomers with ambipolar character.42

In principle, the D–A copolymer class shown
in Figure 2 could be
prepared
by direct homopolymerization of suitable activated DTCH derivatives,
for instance, the mono- and/or dibromination products. Naturally,
such building blocks could also be combined with other different donors
and acceptors, providing access to new molecular and polymeric derivatives.

showing the alternation of donor and acceptor units.

In this study, we focus on the development of a
sustainable access
to 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]cyclohexan-4-one derivatives. We show that the said monomer
can be widely functionalized through the elaboration of the corresponding
dilithiated species. Finally, we introduce one example of original
molecular material prepared by the Suzuki–Miyaura (SM) micellar
coupling in water of a commercially available thiophene boronic derivative
and a dibromo DTCH unit.

Results and Discussion
Our first
approach on the preparation of DTCH involved the formation
of the six-membered ring as the last step. The two possible disconnections
coherent with such approaches regard the thiophene–thiophene
bond (in principle accessible through oxidative coupling) and the
thiophene–ketone bond (accessible through various acylation
approaches). The key intermediates for two such scenarios are derivatives 12 and 16, respectively, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Unsuccessful Synthetic
Routes to DTCH 1a
All protocols feature the readily available thiophen-3-yl-acetic
acid or the corresponding ethyl ester as starting materials. In the
pathway A, the alkylation reaction of thiophen-3-yl-acetic acid ethyl
ester with an excess of n-octyl bromide in the presence
of sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) at room temperature for 6 h led to the isolation of ethyl dialkylthienylacetate 9 as the sole reaction product in 90% yield. Unfortunately,
the 2-bromo derivative cannot be selectively prepared via direct halogenation
reactions (N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)/DMF) and (NBS/CHCl3). We generally obtained mixtures of mono- and dibromination
regioisomers, with the isomer 10 dominating the reaction
mixture. Compound 9 (route B) can be readily hydrolyzed
with alcoholic potassium hydroxide in a sealed glass tube to give 11 in high yield.43 Such derivative
can be used as the counterpart of thiophene-3-boronic acid in the
one-flask acylation/Suzuki44 reaction leading to the target 12 in moderate yield.
The same acylation/Suzuki reaction (route D) enables the preparation
of 17 (again with moderate yield), eventually converted
in 12 by alkylation with octyl bromide in DMF. In terms
of absolute yield, routes D and B are equivalent. Somewhat surprisingly,
the oxidative ring closure45,46 of 12 to
give 1a failed. In particular, we tested both the ring
closure in dichloromethane (DCM) with excess FeCl3 and
the new palladium-catalyzed C–H homocoupling recently appeared
in the literature.47−54 Turning to the other possible disconnection, the one requiring an
intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylation,55,56 we started all over from thiophen-3-yl-acetic acid ethyl ester,
in this case successfully brominated in the 2 position to give 14 in good yield. The latter can be converted in the bithiophene
derivative 15 by the Stille reaction with 2-tributylstannyl
thiophene. However, such Stille coupling should be avoided whenever
possible due to the use of toxic organotin compounds. Indeed, 15 can be conveniently prepared (route E) by direct C–H
arylation of thiophen-3-yl-acetic acid with 2-bromothiophene, regioregularily
in the 2 position and in high yield. Interestingly, the reaction works
smoothly even without pivalic acid.57 Likely,
thiophen-3-yl-acetic acid is acting both as the substrate and as the
ligand in the same reaction. Alkylation of 15 with bromooctane
in the presence of NaH proceeds smoothly to give 16 in
high yield. Unfortunately, all attempts to cyclize 16 via Friedel–Crafts acylation failed.55,56

As the formation of the six-membered ring proved to be the
most
critical step, we redesigned the synthetic approach to converge on
the diketone 3 (Scheme 2), well documented in the literature and thus for sure
accessible.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Routes to DTCH Derivatives 1
The literature procedure leading
to derivative 3 requires
the reaction of 3-lithium-thiophene (generated in situ from the corresponding
3-bromo derivative) with oxalyl chloride to give 4, eventually
cyclized by the action of FeCl3.58 Aiming at the removal of any harsh reagent, the like of lithium
alkanes, we devised two alternative approaches leading to 4 under milder conditions. The first approach starts from cheap and
easily available 3-bromothiophene 6, easily converted
via Sonogashira cross-coupling with 3-ethynylthiophene into the 1,2-di(thiophen-3-yl)ethyne 5 in high yield. The Pd/Cu-catalyzed oxidation reaction of 5 gives the 1,2-di(thiophen-3-yl)ethane-1,2-dione 4 in 90% yield.59 Derivative 4 can be even more conveniently prepared in two steps, starting from
commercially available aldehyde 8. The N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed benzoin condensation of 8 affords the alcohol 7 in excellent yield and under
very mild conditions.60 The latter can
be converted to 4 by MnO2-promoted heterogeneous-phase
oxidation in cyclohexane. Both steps are exceedingly simple and can
be readily scaled up to hundreds of grams with minimum amount of organic
solvents employed. Up to this point, the overall E factor of the process is 8.6, a remarkably small number compared
to the typical synthesis of a functionalized conjugated molecule.
Cyclized product benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione 3 was obtained under
oxidative ring-closing conditions via a modification of the method
previously reported.58 In our hands, feeding
the oxidant to the reaction mixture as a nitromethane solution, as
opposite to adding the open diketone to the suspension of oxidant
in CH2Cl2, proved to be advantageous61 when working with over 100 g of starting diketone.
Notably, we obtained easier control of reaction temperature and limitation
of insoluble byproducts formation (likely due to overoxidation). The
overall E factor for the preparation of 3 is around 33, a still relatively small number. The fourth step involved
a Grignard reaction with a large excess of alkylmagnesium bromide
on benzo[1,2-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione 3. The pinacol–pinacolone rearrangement of compound 2 gave the expected compounds 1a and 1b. The E factor for the overall process, calculated
according to the organic wastes produced in the synthesis of a single
90 g batch, is 363, which would eventually increase to 472 if the
bromination step leading to monomers M1 and M2 (Scheme 3b) is taken
into account as well. This is a remarkably low value when compared
to the little available estimates documented in the literature for
conjugated compounds produced through a comparable number of steps.
Moreover, no harsh reagents are used in the final optimized protocol,
thus ensuring a low synthetic complexity alongside the favorable E factor.

Scheme 3 (a) Stannylation Reactions of DTCH According to a
Direct Lithiation
Approach and (b) Halogenation and Stannylation Reactions of DTCH
Mostly, donor–acceptor
polymers are produced via Stille
or Suzuki–Miyaura coupling involving alkyltin or boronic derivatives,
respectively. From the standpoint of environmental impact, the latter
scheme is preferable. Unfortunately, thiophene derivatives do not
react efficiently and cleanly under SM protocols and Stille couplings
are preferred. Aiming at demonstrating that the DTCH unit could be
introduced in polymers requiring Stille coupling, we first challenged 1b in direct lithiation with lithium tetramethylpiperidine
(LTMP), followed by quenching with tributylstannyl chloride. Scheme 3a shows that the
reaction is not selective, affording a mixture of three compounds, T1, T1a, and T1b. This can be explained,
as outlined in Scheme 3a, by the coordination capabilities of the carbonyl group of DTCH
over LTMP. We thus reverted to a lithium–halogen exchange reaction
scheme. Reaction of M2n-butyllithium
followed by quenching with tributylstannyl chloride affords the target
stannylated derivative T1 in 88% yield (Scheme 3b).

Finally, as a the
first exploratory trial of the suitability of
DTCH as a sustainable building block for the preparation of organic
semiconductors, we prepared derivative 20. To do so in
compliance with our original aim to look for sustainable products,
we took advantage of the micellar Suzuki–Miyaura protocol we
have recently described, enabling the coupling of aryl bromides and
boronic acids and esters in water, at room temperature and under aerobic
conditions.62 Thus, a suspension of M2, commercially available 5′-hexyl-2,2′-bithiophene-5-boronic
acid pinacol ester 19, triethylamine, and Pd(dtbf)Cl2 in a 2 wt % solution of Kolliphor EL in deionized water was
stirred at room temperature for 3 h under standard laboratory atmosphere,
affording 20 in good yield (90%) after a simple silica
filtration (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Difunctionalization of DTCH Derivatives 1 and
Synthetic
Scheme for New Monomer 20
The spectroscopic features of 20 confirm
the mildly
accepting nature of the DTCH bridge. The compound displays in fact
the typical broad and intense absorption associated with a charge-transfer
excitation. The intense, strongly red-shifted fluorescence further
contributes in confirming the charge-transfer nature of the excitation
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
To obtain photovoltaic information of compound 20, we
have fabricated inverted organic solar cells. The performance of photovoltaic
devices are summarized in Table S2 in the
Supporting Information.

In conclusion, we have synthesized a
new building block based on
dithienocyclohexanone for conjugated polymers and small molecules
devising two simple synthetic pathways that uses relatively inexpensive
and readily available starting materials. Moreover, these protocols
are free from hazardous chemicals like n-butyllithium.
This allows a multigram (possibly multikilograms) preparation and
makes this process economically viable and environmentally attractive.
DTCH can be easily elaborated through its corresponding dibrominated
derivative. Moreover, the first example of DTCH-based material we
describe, the small-molecule hexathiophene analogue 20, can be prepared in water at room temperature and without taking
care of the reaction environment. Further investigation of this resourceful
protocol in polymerization reactions is under way.

A further
line of research will involve the functionalization of
the carbonyl group, for instance, with malononitrile derivatives,
to enhance the acceptor character of the electron-poor portion of
DTCH and tune the properties of the final materials.

Experimental
Section
All commercially available starting materials and
solvents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further
purification. Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel 60
Å (230–400 mesh). Thin-layer chromatography was carried
out using Merck silica gel GF254 plates. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 400 (400 MHz)
spectrometer and Bruker Avance 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer, respectively.
All of the spectra have been recorded with 90° pulse and a relaxation
delay of 1.5 s for 1H NMR and 4 s for 13C NMR
spectroscopies. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded using a
7 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT
Ultra Thermo Scientific). The instrument ion
source used employed was atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI) operated in positive-ion mode using nitrogen as nebulizing
gas. Mass spectra were recorded in profile mode with a mass range
of 100–1000 m/z and an average
resolving power of 400 000 at m/z 400; microscan: 1, maximum injection time: 1000, and automatic gain
control on the ion cyclotron resonance cell: 106.

h removing water through the Dean–Stark trap. The hot mixture
is filtered to remove MnO2, and the filtrate is allowed
to cool to room temperature. Pure product crystallizes as yellow needles
upon cooling and is collected by filtration. The filter containing
spent MnO2 is continuously extracted with CH2Cl2 to recover the fraction of adsorbed product, which
is later recovered by solvent evaporation under reduced pressure and
purified by crystallization from cyclohexane. Residual solvent is
evaporated from both fractions under reduced pressure at 50 °C,
obtaining pure product as a yellow crystalline solid (234.37 g, 1.055

M 3,7-dimetyloctylmagnesium bromide in Me-THF (665.0 mmol, 533.0 mL),
anhydrous diglyme (89.24 g, 665.0 mmol), and anhydrous THF (150 mL)
is prepared under inert atmosphere. The solution is cooled to −15
°C with an ice–salt bath, and derivative 3 (40.000 g, 181.8 mmol) is added portionwise over 1 h. The mixture
