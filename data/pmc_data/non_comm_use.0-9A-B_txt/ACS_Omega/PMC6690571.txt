Allosteric
ligands within a given chemotype can have the propensity
to display a wide range of pharmacology, as well as unexpected changes
in GPCR subtype selectivity, typically mediated by single-atom modifications
to the ligand. Due to the unexpected nature of these “molecular
switches”, chemotypes with this property are typically abandoned
in lead optimization. Recently, we have found that in vivo oxidative
metabolism by CYP450s can also engender molecular switches
within allosteric ligands, changing the mode of pharmacology and leading
to unwanted toxicity. We required a higher-throughput approach to
assess in vivo metabolic molecular switches, and we turned to a “synthetic
liver”, a 96 well kit of biomimetic catalysts (e.g., metalloporphyrins)
to rapidly survey a broad panel of synthetic CYP450s’
ability to oxidize/“metabolize” an mGlu5 PAM
(VU0403602) known to undergo an in vivo CYP450-mediated
molecular switch. While the synthetic CYP450s did generate
a number of oxidative “metabolites” at known “hot
spots”, several of which proved to be pure mGlu5 PAMs comparable in potency to the parent, the known CYP450-mediated in vivo ago-PAM metabolite, namely, VU0453103, was not
formed. Thus, this technology platform has potential to identify hot
spots for oxidative metabolism and produce active metabolites of small-molecule
ligands in a high-throughput, scalable manner.

Introduction
From steep structure–activity
relationships to family subtype
selectivity issues to a potential lack of conservation of allosteric
sites (e.g., functional activity) across species, allosteric GPCR
drug discovery is fraught with challenges and development caveats.1−4 However, no challenge is more daunting than that of “molecular
switches”, subtle structural changes to an allosteric ligand,
often single-atom (e.g, introduction of a methyl, fluoro, amino, or
hydroxyl moiety), that can reverse the mode of pharmacology (e.g.,
from a positive to a negative allosteric modulator, PAM to NAM, or
vice versa) or change family subtype selectivity.1−11 Fortunately, molecular switches are not present across all allosteric
ligands but occur rather randomly within certain highly planar chemotypes,
suggesting shallow induced fit pockets. While molecular switches have
oftentimes been proven beneficial to gain entry to activity at a given
receptor subtype (e.g., conversion of an mGlu4 PAM to a
selective mGlu1 PAM12 or an
mGlu5 PAM to a selective mGlu3 NAM13), they can also convert a nontoxic “pure”
mGlu5 PAM (VU0403602, 1) to neurotoxic mGlu5 ago-PAM (VU0453103, 2) in vivo via an unexpected
CYP450-mediated oxidation (Figure 1).14 The latter
is challenging to de-risk, without multiple in vivo studies, performed
with and without CYP450 inhibitors, to ascertain parent
and metabolite drug levels as well as neurotoxicity in rodent seizure
models, and ultimately preparative CYP450 incubations to
identify the structure of the neurotoxic metabolite.14 Within a fast-moving lead optimization effort, employing
an in vivo de-risking strategy is not practical in terms of time,
cost, and the likelihood of success. Based on these realities, we
were intrigued by newly available biomimetic oxidation (BMO) kits,
advertised as a “synthetic liver”, mimicking the oxidative
metabolism of multiple CYP450 enzymes (e.g., synthetic
metalloporphyrins).15 Importantly, 96 individual
synthetic livers are in each well of a 96 well plate, allowing an
expansive survey of synthetic biotransformation of a ligand, coupled
with production kits to readily scale the chemistry from any distinct
well (e.g., synthetic CYP450), enabling isolation and characterization
of the “metabolite(s)”.12 If successful and productive, this could revolutionize our current,
laborious approach to identifying allosteric ligand chemotypes susceptible
to in vivo molecular switches and more readily focus optimization
efforts on chemical series devoid of molecular switches.

Figure 1 Major biotransformation
of pure mGlu5 PAM, namely, VU0403602
(1), to M1, a potent, neurotoxic mGlu5 ago-PAM
(VU0453103, 2), and M2, the inactive product of amide
hydrolysis 3 observed in male rat hepatic S9 fractions.
Other minor metabolites were the corresponding N-oxide
or result of oxidation of the acetylene moiety.

Results
and Discussion
Knowing the in vitro and in vivo metabolism
of 1,11 as well as the relevant
CYP450-mediated
oxidative metabolites, we elected to assess the ability of a commercial
BMO kit15 to metabolize mGlu5 PAM 1 and determine if any of the 96 synthetic livers
could generate 2 or other known metabolites. Incubation
of 1 with the screening BMO kit led to the production
of only four metabolite-like compounds M3–M6 (Figure 2).16 The metabolite of greatest interest, the mGlu5 ago-PAM 2, produces a parent ion adduct of [M + H]+ with m/z 311 and MS/MS produced the minor fragment
of m/z 293 resulting from the loss
of water (−18 Da; −H2O), while the water
loss fragment from 1 (m/z 295 [M + H]+) results in a m/z of 277. The next major fragments of 2 result
from, first, the loss of the cyclobutanol moiety producing an [M –
71 + 2H]+ ion at m/z 241
and, second, fragmentation of the carbon nitrogen bond producing the
benzoyl ion at m/z 223. For 1, the fragments associated with the water-assisted hydrolysis
of the amide bond and the loss of the cyclobutyl group are also observed
in the MS/MS and MS/MS/MS (MS3) at m/z 242 and m/z 241, respectively.
The last major fragment observed in both 1 and 2 is the decarboxylation producing a fragment with a m/z of 196. Since a standard of 2 was available, we were able to determine via retention time analysis
that no detectable amount of 2, representing hydroxylation
of the 3-position on the cyclobutyl moiety of 1, was
produced by any of the 96 individual synthetic metalloporphyrins in
the BMO kit.16

Figure 2 Observed key fragments
of M3–M6. Key HMBC correlations in
blue.

The BMO screening kit did produce
four other oxidative species,
and analysis of the unknowns produced from 1 (M3–M6)
were first analyzed by UPLC MS/MS/MS (UPLCMS3).16 The parent ion of M3 was observed as the [M
+ H]+ adduct at m/z 311,
and the first notable fragment from the MS/MS was the loss of water
corresponding to the m/z at 293.
The major fragment at m/z 257 resulted
from the loss of the cyclobutyl moiety, which is an increase of 16
Da from the removal of the cyclobutyl moiety observed at m/z 241 in 1 and 2. The
next series of fragments at m/z 242
and 241 were the same fragments observed in 1 and 2; however, a new fragment at m/z 240 represented the benzoyl ion fragment. This fragment at m/z 240 is also observed as the major fragment
in the MS3 of m/z 257.
The remaining two fragments are decarboxylation and oxygen loss fragmentation
at m/z 196 and an interesting fragment
at m/z 214. This m/z 214 fragment corresponded to the loss of −43
Da from m/z 257, which would correspond
to the loss of oxygen and hydrogen cyanide.1 These fragments at m/z 257 and
240 indicate that the oxygen was not attached to the cyclobutyl moiety
like in 2, and thus, the fragment at m/z 214 indicates that there was a high likelihood
that M3 is the N-oxide of 1, a metabolite
detected in small amounts from traditional metabolite identification
(MetID) studies. A simple comparison of the retention time, fragmentation
patterns, and coinjection (average of the coinjection retention time
analysis tR = 0.923 ± 0.000 min)
with an available standard, synthesized to support the previous MetID
studies, confirmed the identity of M3 as 4 (VU0409496),
the N-oxide of 1 (Figure 3).16

Figure 3 Confirmed structure
of M3 as the N-oxide 4 (VU0409496).

The biomimetic kit afforded 3.3 mg of M4. UPLCMS3 of
M4 found a parent ion of [M + H]+ at m/z 241, which corresponded to the primary amide
of 1. MS/MS of the parent ion gave two fragments, the
water-assisted hydrolysis at m/z 242 and the major fragment at m/z 224, the benzoyl ion. The MS3 of m/z 224 gave the decarboxylation fragment at m/z 196. All listed fragments indicate the identity
of M4 as the primary amide of 1. The 1H NMR
of M4 displayed the same seven aromatic proton signals observed in 1 and lacked signals corresponding to the cyclobutyl moiety.16 The only extra signal observed is the result
of an increased barrier of rotation due to the intramolecular hydrogen
bond observed in picolinamides resulting in the primary amide having
two unique signals at δH 7.80 (1H, br s, NH) and
δH 5.69 (1H, br s, NH).17

The biomimetic kit also afforded 1.8 mg of M5. UPLCMS3 of M5 found a parent ion of [M + H]+ at m/z 327, which corresponds to the addition
of two
oxygens to 1 (+32 Da; +O × 2). The first fragment
resulted from the loss of water with m/z 309. The familiar loss of the cyclobutyl moiety and the water-assisted
hydrolysis fragments were present at m/z 273 and 274; however, both fragments were still +32 Da heavier than 1 (m/z 241 and 242) when
these same losses occurred. MS3 of the major fragment m/z 273 indicated the loss of ammonia (−17
DA; −NH3) to afford the benzoyl ion at m/z 256 followed by the loss of hydrogen cyanide
(−27 Da; −HCN) at m/z 246 and decarboxylation at m/z 228, all of which are still +32 Da heavier than their counterpart’s
fragments from 1. These observations indicated that the
two oxygens must be attached to the phenylethynylpyridine moiety and
not as the N-oxide since HCN was lost and both oxygens
still remained.16

The 1H NMR spectrum of M5 was obtained to hopefully
glean more structural information. The chemical shifts as expected
for the cyclobutyl moiety remain constant. The proton resonances from
the picolinamide and the 2-fluorobenzyl moiety were all deshielded
up to δH 9.11 (1H, br dd, J = 2.1,
0.8 Hz), 8.42 (1H, dd, J = 8.1, 2.1 Hz), 8.34 (1H,
dd, J = 8.2, 0.8 Hz), 7.78 (1H, dt, J = 7.8, 1.3 Hz), 7.74 (1H, ddd, J = 8.8, 2.7, 1.6
Hz), 7.53 (1H, td, J = 8.4, 5.2 Hz), and 7.41 (1H,
td, J = 16.6, 2.6 0.9 Hz) in M3 from δH 8.66 (1H, br s), 8.18 (1H, d, J = 8.0 Hz),
7.94 (1H, dd, J = 8.0, 2.0 Hz), 7.39–7.31
(2H, m), 7.25 (1H, dd, J = 9.7, 2.8 Hz), and 7.15–7.06
(1H, m) observed in 1. The only exchangeable signal observed
was the amide NH proton at δH 8.17 (1H, br d, J = 7.9 Hz). The 1H NMR revealed that no carbon–hydrogen
bonds were replaced with carbon–oxygen bonds, indicating the
ethynyl moiety as the most likely position for the addition of the
two oxygens. In order to determine if oxidation occurred at the triple
bond, an HMBC spectrum of M5 was obtained. Careful examination of
the HMBC correlations from two of the picolinamide protons at δH 9.11 and δH 8.42 shows that they both display
correlations to a ketone at δC 191.1, while two protons
from the 2-fluorobenzyl moiety at δH 7.78 and δH 7.74 both display correlations to a ketone at δC 191.0. These observations support the transformation of the
triple bond into a di-ketone assigning the potential structure as
M5.16

The biomimetic kit provided
only 0.5 mg of M6, which was found
to have a parent ion of [M + H]+m/z 299. This mass was rather interesting since it was only
4 Da higher in mass than 1, which indicated that functionalities
were lost and added. Notable fragments observed in the MS/MS were
the loss of water at m/z 288 (−18
Da; −H2O) and the loss of the cyclobutyl moiety
[M – 55 + 2H]+ to afford the major fragment at m/z 245. Further fragmentation (MS3) of m/z 245 resulted in
the formation of the water-assisted amide hydrolysis product at m/z 246, the loss of ammonia to form the
benzoyl ion (−17 Da; −NH3) at m/z 228, loss of hydrogen cyanide (−27 Da;
−HCN) at m/z 218, and decarboxylation
at m/z 200. Assuming that a carbon
was lost and adding 12 Da to m/z 299 gives a m/z of 311 indicate
that there is a high likelihood that a carbon was removed. Since all
lost fragments have been identified as fragments lost from M3–M5
and since the added oxygen was still present after decarboxylation,
the lost carbon and the added oxygen must be distinct from the phenylethynylpyridine
moiety. Examination of the 1H NMR shows that the cyclobutyl
moiety and amide proton remain unchanged and all seven protons from
the picolinamide and 2-fluorobenzyl were still present at δH 8.92 (1H, br d, J = 1.6 Hz), 8.33 (1H, d, J = 8.1 Hz), 8.22 (1H, dd, J = 8.1, 2.1
Hz), 7.60–7.47 (3H, m), and 7.36 (1H, tdd, J = 8.1, 2.6, 1.3 Hz).13 Since the cyclobutyl
moiety, picolinamide, and the 2-fluorobenzyl moiety were not modified,
it left the ethynyl linkage as the only possible place for modification.
If the ethynyl linkage was replaced with a ketone, then the loss of
a carbon and the addition of an oxygen would be accounted for. It
has also been shown to be possible to convert internal alkynes into
shorter ketones with the use of porphyrins.18 This assumption would assign the structure as M6.16

In order to unambiguously confirm the structures
and identities
of M4–M6, we synthesized de novo these putative synthetic metabolites
and compared spectral data and retention times (Scheme 1). Starting from commercial acid 5, a HATU-mediated amide coupling with cyclobutyl amine 6 afforded amide 7 in 85% yield.19 A Sonogashira coupling between 7 and 3-fluorophenyl
acetylene 8 provided 1 in 56% yield. Alternatively, 1 was also prepared via a different route. Direct Sonogashira
coupling of acid 5 with 8 delivered acid 3, which could then be employed to access 1 via
a standard amide coupling. Acid 3 can also be employed
to give the primary carboxamide M4 (9) via an amide coupling
sequence with (NH4)2CO3, albeit in
only 32% yield.20 Following a known literature
protocol,21 the acetylene moiety in 1 was smoothly converted to the diketone M5 (10) by treatment with KMnO4. The last putative metabolite
M6 (14) was accessed in two steps. A palladium-catalyzed
acylation between boronic acid 11 and acid chloride 12 gave ketone 13 in low yield. Hydrolysis of
the acid and another HATU-mediated amide coupling with 6 delivered M6 (14) in low yield over two steps (16%).

To confirm the
structure of M4 as the primary amide of 1, it was synthesized
(Scheme 1) and compared
via retention time, fragmentation patterns,
coinjection, and 1H NMR comparison (see the Supporting Information).16 The comparison analysis confirmed M4 as 9 (average
of the coinjection retention time analysis tR = 1.047 ± 0.001 min), the primary amide of 1 (Figure 4).16 Similarly, the proposed structure of M5, di-ketone 10, was synthesized on scale (Scheme 1) to aid in the confirmation of the structure.
The analysis of the retention time (average of the coinjection retention
time analysis tR = 0.957 ± 0.001
min), fragmentation patterns, coinjection, and 1H NMR comparison
confirmed the identity of M5 as the di-ketone 10.16 Once again, to confirm the proposed structure
of M6, 14 was synthesized on scale (Scheme 1). Analysis of the retention
time (average of the coinjection retention time analysis tR = 0.969 ± 0.001 min), mass fragmentation patterns,
coinjection, and 1H NMR confirmed 14 as the
structure for M4.16 With M3–M6 in
hand, they were evaluated in our standard mGlu5 calcium
mobilization functional assay, and M5 and M6 were inactive in both
PAM and NAM modes; however, M3 and M4 proved more interesting.

The N-oxide,
M3 (4, VU0409496) proved
to be a potent, pure PAM in our standard screening assays (human EC50 = 38.7 nM, pEC50 = 7.41 ± 0.06, 71.5 ±
2.6% Glu Max; rat EC50 = 28 nM, pEC50 = 7.55
± 0.06, 58.5 ± 3.6% Glu Max), roughly equipotent to the
parent 1 and similarly devoid of mGlu5 agonism
(human EC50 > 30 μM). This active metabolite was
produced in very small quantities in native systems, but the BMO kit
produced M3 in a significant amount to warrant characterization. Further
evaluation of M3 found it to be non-CNS penetrant, with modest fraction
unbound (fu (h, r) = 0.012, 0.033) and a metabolic activator of 3A4; therefore,
M3 was not viable as a lead. The primary carboxamide M4 (VU6025968),
a new synthetic oxidative metabolite not observed in native systems,
was also an active mGlu5 PAM. As we have sufficient quantity
from the BMO production kit, we screened both the kit-produced M4
and synthetic M4 in the human mGlu5 assay. The kit-produced
M4 afforded a pure PAM profile, with an EC50 of 510 nM
(75% Glu Max), and the synthetic-derived M4 was equivalent (EC50 = 315 nM, 77%, and no agonism noted up to 30 μM).
Importantly, it was significant to identify active oxidative metabolites
from the BMO kit that retained the desired mode of pharmacology (pure
PAM versus ago-PAM) that were either produced in minor quantities
or not observed in classical native system preparations.

Conclusions
In summary, the BMO kit proved to afford a highly expedient synthetic
liver producing a number of known metabolites of 1, as
well as novel synthetic metabolites in quantities sufficient for full
characterization and biological assessment. MetID studies of the synthetic
analogs were confirmed by independent synthesis, and unexpectedly
based on the structures of M3–M6, two were potent pure mGlu5 PAMs, that is, active metabolites. We hoped that the BMO
kit would produce the potent, neurotoxic mGlu5 ago-PAM
(VU0453103, 2) of pure PAM 1, the result
of an oxidative-metabolism-induced molecular switch; however, this
was not observed in any of the 96 individual synthetic livers. Still,
the technology platform has utility in producing on scale synthetic
oxidative metabolites, but the biomimetic catalysts (e.g., metalloporphyrins)
may not fully encompass all of the oxidative chemistry of endogenous
CYP450s. Further work in this arena is in progress, and
additional studies with other allosteric ligands will be reported
in due course.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All reactions were carried out employing
standard chemical techniques under air unless noted. Solvents used
for extraction, washing, and chromatography were HPLC-grade. All reagents
were purchased from commercial sources and were used without further
purification. All microwave reactions were carried out in sealed tubes
in a Biotage Initiator microwave synthesis reactor. Analytical HPLC
was performed on an Agilent 1200 LCMS with a gradient of 5–95%
MeCN in 0.1% TFA water over 1.5 min and UV detection at 215 and 254
nm along with ELSD detection and electrospray ionization, with all
final compounds showing >95% purity. High-resolution mass spectra
were obtained on an Agilent 6540 UHD Q-TOF with the ESI source. Automated
flash column chromatography was performed on a Teledyne ISCO Combi-Flash
system. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on a Gilson preparative
reversed-phase HPLC system comprising a 333 aqueous pump with solvent-selection
valve, 334 organic pump, GX-271 or GX-281 liquid handler, two column
switching valves, and a 155 UV detector. The UV wavelength for fraction
collection was user-defined, with absorbance at 254 nm always monitored.
The column used was Phenomenex Axia-packed Gemini C18 (30
× 50 mm, 5 μm). For the acidic method, the mobile phase
was CH3CN in H2O (0.1% TFA). Gradient conditions
were 0.75 min equilibration followed by a user-defined gradient (starting
organic percentage, ending organic percentage, duration), held at
95% CH3CN in H2O (0.1% TFA) for 1 min, 50 mL/min,
23 °C. For the basic method, the mobile phase was CH3CN in H2O (0.05% v/v NH4OH). Gradient conditions
were 0.75 min equilibration followed by a user-defined gradient (starting
organic percentage, ending organic percentage, duration), held at
95% CH3CN. LCMS3 experiments were carried out
on an Agilent 1290 UPLC system coupled to a Thermo Scientific LTQ
XL Linear Ion trap mass spectrometer using CH3CN and 10
mM ammonium formate with pH adjusted to 4.1 as the mobile phases with
a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (2.6 μ, 2.1 × 50 mm,
100 Å column) held at 50 °C with a CERA Temperature Controller
at 1 mL/min. All NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker AV-400
instrument. 1H chemical shifts are reported as δ
values in ppm relative to the residual solvent peak (CDCl3 = 7.26, DMSO-d6 = 2.50, CD3OD = 4.78). Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity
(br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, dd
= doublet of doublets, dt = doublet of triplets, ddd = doublet of
doublet of doublets, ddq = doublets of doublets of quartets, sext
= sextet, m = multiplet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. 13C chemical shifts are reported as δ values in ppm relative
to the residual solvent peak (CDCl3 = 77.2, DMSO-d6 = 39.5, CD3OD = 49.15).

2 N HCl (pH 1–2). The acidified mixture was extracted with
CHCl3, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated
