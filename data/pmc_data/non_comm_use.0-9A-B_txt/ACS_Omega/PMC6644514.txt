We
present a novel route for the synthesis of zinc blende CdSe
nanoplatelets (NPLs) that exclude the use of short-chain alkyl carboxylates.
CdSe NPLs obtained without acetates are shown to be extremely asymmetric
and rectangular. The effects of several experimental parameters such
as the nature of cadmium carboxylates, selenium precursors, and precursor
concentration ratios are studied. Our experiments, together with complementary
small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering results, show that the formation
of NPLs is not related to soft templating. We discuss our findings
in regard to several other formation mechanisms of NPLs, which have
appeared recently in the literature, and propose that the steric hindrance
caused by ligand packing exerts an influence on the growth and geometry
of two-dimensional NPLs.

Introduction
The colloidal synthesis
of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures
has been an attractive topic because of their unique physical and
chemical properties.1,2 For instance, colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets
(NPLs) can be synthesized with a thickness controlled with atomic
precision,3 which results in exceptional
optical properties, comparable to the ones offered by the quantum
wells synthesized with epitaxial growth techniques.4 In these 2D structures, the density of electron and hole
states is a continuous steplike function of the energy, whereas for
zero-dimensional or one-dimensional (1D) nanocrystals, it has a discrete
nature.5 The binding energy of excitons
is enhanced greatly because of the small dielectric constant of the
surrounding media6 and the effect of mirror
charges at the interface.7 This leads to
an extremely narrow photoluminescence (PL) line width and a very short
fluorescence lifetime.8

The 2D colloidal
CdSe nanocrystals have been synthesized in two
different crystal structures: hexagonal wurtzite (WZ) CdSe nanoribbons9 or quantum belts10 and cubic zinc blende (ZB) CdSe NPLs.3 Both the growth mechanisms and the final objects are very different
for these two crystal structures. In the case of WZ nanoparticles,
a lamellar-like template growth with a cadmium chloride alkylamine
complex serving as a mold during the formation of WZ CdSe 2D nanostructures
has been evidenced.9−13 These nanoparticles aggregate easily, have weakly bound ligands,
and have a balanced number of anions and cations. On the contrary,
CdSe NPLs3 with a cubic ZB crystal structure
have an excess of cations, controllable lateral extension from few
nanometers to a micrometer14 and good colloidal
stability, thanks to carboxylate ligands bound onto the two cadmium-rich
large base facets. Their thickness can be controlled precisely and
different chalcogenide NPLs have been synthesized.4,15 The
first attempt to describe the formation mechanism of ZB NPLs in 2011
showed that CdSe NPLs are formed through continuous lateral extension
of small seeds that possess some facets blocked by the ligands. The
thickness of the NPLs is fixed in the very first stages of the formation.16 The lateral extension of NPLs through continuous
reaction of precursors has been confirmed later when NPLs with lateral
dimensions of few tens of nanometers are extended laterally to dimensions
of few hundreds of nanometers with continuous injection of precursors.14 This lateral extension proceeds without the
formation of seeds, which suggests that the NPLs extend through continuous
reaction of precursors rather than through oriented attachment, as
is the case for rock salt PbS NPLs.17 Recently,
three alternative growth mechanisms have been proposed to describe
the formation of ZB CdSe NPLs. (i) Oriented attachment: Peng’s
group has been able to isolate the seeds of 550 nm emitting NPLs and
showed that these seeds form NPLs through oriented attachment.18 They suggest that both cadmium acetate and cadmium n-alkanoate with large n (n > 7) are necessary for the conversion of spherical seeds into
2D
NPLs. (ii) Soft templated formation: Lyashchova et al. have shown
that CdSe ZB NPLs can be obtained from cadmium octanoate without the
addition of short-chain Cd(carboxylate)2, in a saturated
aqueous alcoholic solution of selenourea.19 The authors conclude that the NPLs form in the smectic A mesophase
of the cadmium octanoate. In fact, mesomorphic phase transitions can
be observed for many metal carboxylates, showing thermotropic lamellar
or columnar mesophases in the phase sequences.20,21 In the case of cadmium carboxylates, the phase diagram depends on
the carboxylate chain length.22 It has
also been found that cadmium myristate in octadecene solution shows
a lamellar mesophase before melting into micelles for colloidal synthesis
of quantum dots.23 Unfortunately, in the
work of Lyashchova, no transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of the NPLs have been shown, and the presence of the lamellar phases
has not been linked to the formation of the 2D CdSe NPLs. (iii) Growth
driven by precursors’ insolubility: Riedinger et al.24 have shown that NPLs can form in isotropic melts
of either Cd(myristate)2 or Cd(propionate)2,
confirming that a mixture of short and long cadmium carboxylate is
not necessary to obtain NPLs. The authors state that the solubility
of Cd(carboxylate)2 in octadecene determines whether quantum
dots or NPLs are formed. If the Cd precursor dissolves, quantum dots
are formed; if the Cd precursor is insoluble, NPLs would form.

Here, we study the possibility to synthesize CdSe NPLs in octadecene
with pure long-chain cadmium carboxylate precursors without detectable
aggregation. We study the effect on the reaction of several different
cadmium carboxylates, different selenium precursors, and a wide range
of synthetic conditions. UV absorption combined with TEM images of
the samples demonstrates that when short alkyl chain carboxylate precursors
are not used, the NPLs have extremely asymmetric, rectangular shapes
with a small dimension that is often smaller than 10 nm. We observe
that for the synthesis of NPLs without cadmium acetate, we need (i)
a high concentration of cadmium precursors (0.1 mol/L), (ii) selenium
precursors with a good reactivity, and (iii) the temperature to be
sufficiently high to promote precursors’ reactivity. In contrast
to Riedinger et al., we show that NPLs can be formed in a soluble
mixture of long alkyl chain cadmium precursors with 1-octadecene (ODE).
In contrast to Lyashchova et al., we show that NPLs can be formed
even in the absence of soft templating. At the onset of the NPL formation,
wormlike NPLs are observed with small-/wide-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS/WAXS) studies of the precursor demonstrating that the lamellar
and/or columnar phase of cadmium octanoate persists in solution up
to 180 °C but disappears above 200 °C under our experimental
conditions. In spite of the absence of any molecular templates above
200 °C, NPLs can be formed. At intermediate steps, ex situ electron
microscopy does not show evidence of spherical seeds, which rules
out an oriented attachment-driven mechanism such as that observed
by Peng et al. for thicker NPLs.

Results and Discussion
Our synthesis is based on a liquid-phase hot-injection methodology
(Figure 1, right).
A typical protocol is as follows: in a three-neck flask, 1 mmol of
cadmium octanoate (CdC8) in 10 mL of ODE is heated up to
175 °C under argon flow, and then a mixture of 100 μL of
stoichiometric TOPSe (2.24 M) in 0.5 mL of ODE is injected. Two minutes
after the injection, the color of the clear solution becomes yellowish.
The synthesis reaction can last up to 2 h. The final color of the
solution is bright orange with CdSe NPLs suspended in the mixture.
The resulting CdSe NPLs are precipitated and washed three times with
ethanol and then dispersed in hexane for further characterizations.
The synthesis yields NPLs with typical absorption features of three-monolayer
(ML) thick ZB NPLs including two excitonic transition peaks with maxima
at 432 and 459 nm, respectively, corresponding to the electron/light
hole and the electron/heavy hole transitions.3 The PL emission spectrum presents a strong emission peak at 461
nm with a full width at half-maximum of 15 nm combined with a broad
emission signal at low energy that can be attributed to trap emission.
A 2 nm stoke shift is detected in the case of PL, and the quantum
yield is measured to be around 3%. The TEM of the NPLs shows 2D structures
with very asymmetric rectangular-like shapes (Figure S1). These elongated shapes are very different from
the much more symmetrical shape of the three-ML NPLs obtained with
other protocols.3,25,26 X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) confirmed the ZB crystal structure
of the NPLs (Figure S2).

Figure 1 Comparisons between a
standard synthesis for ZB CdSe NPLs (left)
and the new synthesis without acetate salts (right) with their schematic
routes illustrated in (a) correspondingly as well as TEM images and
absorption (solid line)/PL (dashed line) spectra in (b,c). This figure
is reproduced from refs (3) and (16).

We have explored the different experimental parameters
that influence
this synthesis (see Table 1). We first study the influence of the precursors of selenium
(Figure 2). When Se
powder is used, three-ML NPLs can be obtained without acetate salts
(Figure 2a). The synthesis
follows a one-pot methodology with a high reaction temperature of
240 °C that is necessary to activate the Se precursor in ODE.
We can obtain CdSe NPLs but with very low chemical yields because
of the limited reactivity of the Se precursor. Consequently, for the
following trials, we focus on two other Se precursors: Se–ODE
(0.1 M) and stoichiometric TOPSe (2.24 M). In these cases, the syntheses
were conducted using a hot-injection approach at various reaction
temperatures, as detailed in Figure 2b,c. Both Se–ODE (0.1 M) and TOPSe (2.24 M)
can lead to the formation of CdSe NPLs without the addition of acetate
salts. The reason why we treat CdC8 and Se–ODE at
higher temperatures is that generally the reactivity of Se–ODE
is not as high as TOPSe, and thus, higher reaction temperatures are
required for the reaction to proceed. When Se–ODE is used,
we observe that NPL formation always comes with the formation of CdSe
quantum dots as indicated by the absorption tail at low energy range
in the absorption spectrum. This could be due to the reactions between
the cadmium precursor and the various reagents produced from the complex
activation process of Se–ODE during the synthesis.27 When the reaction temperature is raised from
210 to 230 °C, mostly three-ML thick CdSe NPLs are formed. However,
when the temperature is further increased to 250 °C, a considerable
decrease in the NPL formation yield is observed rather than the formation
of four-ML thick NPLs. When TOPSe (2.24 M) is used as a Se precursor,
the same trends occur. A low reaction temperature of 150 °C produces
CdSe NPLs with a thickness of only two MLs. Comparatively, pure three-ML
NPLs are obtained when the reaction temperature is raised to 175 °C.
For reaction temperatures of 200 °C or higher, the shape of the
CdSe NPLs becomes distorted, and when the temperature is further increased
to 225 °C, the amount of NPLs is significantly reduced. Overall,
the NPLs synthesized with Se–ODE have very different shapes
with strong shape dispersions, whereas the NPLs synthesized with TOPSe
are more rectangular-shaped. It should be mentioned here that 2.24
M TOPSe rather than 1 M TOPSe is used in our syntheses. When 1 M TOPSe
is used in place of 2.24 M TOPSe, 1D nanowires are obtained (Figure S3).

We have also studied the influence of the long n-alkanoate cadmium precursor on the possibility to obtain
NPLs without
cadmium acetate. We first focus on cadmium octanoate. We observed
that the formation of CdSe NPLs strongly depends on the concentration
of the cadmium precursor (CdC8) in octadecene (CCdC8). We did not observe the absorption
features corresponding to NPLs when CCdC8 is as low as 0.002 mol/L (Figure 3). The characteristic excitonic peaks of
CdSe NPLs begin to appear when CCdC8 reaches 0.005 mol/L. CdSe NPLs prepared at higher concentrations
(e.g., CCdC8 = 0.06 mol/L or
0.1 mol/L) have more regular shape and are produced in larger quantity.

Figure 3 Influence
of the concentration of cadmium precursor in ODE: various
amounts of CdC8 in 10 mL of ODE and 100 μL of TOPSe
(2.24 M) in 0.5 mL of ODE injected at 175 °C under Ar.

We have also investigated the
influence of the ratio of precursors
Se/Cd for a fixed concentration of the cadmium precursor CCdC8 = 0.1 mol/L. We find that when cadmium
is in excess compared to selenium, NPLs are formed more easily in
higher yields (Figure 4a). For equimolar concentration of cadmium and selenium, three-ML
NPLs can be formed, but a large number of other structures are formed
as well (Figure 4a,
right). The necessity to have an excess of cadmium is in agreement
with what we have learned from the existing preparation methods of
CdSe NPLs9,12,25 and can be
rationalized with the two Cd-rich facets present in the ZB NPLs.28

Figure 4 (a) Influence of the ratio of precursors Se/Cd for a fixed
concentration
of the cadmium precursor: 0.4 g of CdC8 in 10 mL of ODE
and various amounts of TOPSe (2.24 M) in 0.5 mL of ODE injected at
175 °C under Ar and (b) influence of cadmium carboxylate: 1 mmol
of Cd carboxylate in 10 mL of ODE and 100 μL of TOPSe (2.24
M) in 0.5 mL of ODE injected at 175 °C under Ar.

In addition to cadmium octanoate, we have investigated
longer cadmium
carboxylates such as cadmium decanoate (CdC10) and cadmium
myristate (CdC14). The reactivity of CdC10 is
close to that of CdC8, and a simple replacement of CdC8 with CdC10 in the synthesis route does not seem
to affect the chemical yield and the quality of the NPLs. When CdC14 is used, however, NPLs are formed but with a yield that
is much lower. After size selective precipitation, three-ML NPLs are
identified with other structures in the TEM image, but they appear
as very irregular wormlike structures (Figure 4b).

To better understand the formation
mechanism, we followed the formation
of CdSe NPLs during the reaction by repeating our synthesis of NPLs
with cadmium octanoate using TOPSe (2.24 M) and acquiring absorption
and TEM images of aliquot samples at different times during the reaction
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 Absorption
spectra and TEM images of CdSe NPLs at different reaction
times: 1 mmol of CdC8 in 10 mL of ODE and 100 μL
of TOPSe (2.24 M) in 0.5 mL of ODE injected at 175 °C under Ar.

Five minutes after the injection
of the Se precursor, the absorption
spectrum of the aliquot shows two small peaks at 380 and 450 nm that
are characteristics of two-ML and three-ML thick NPLs, respectively,
with some lateral confinement. The TEM images do not clearly display
the NPLs but rather show the aggregates that look much more like a
mesh of connected wormlike structures. It is very striking that at
this point, any excitonic structures appear at all in the absorption
spectra. These strongly suggest that at least part of this wormlike
structure has a precisely controlled thickness of two and three CdSe
MLs. The connectivity of the TEM images suggests that small nanocrystals
aggregate possibly through the oriented attachment, but it is also
possible that geometrical constraints imposed by the bulky C8 chain
of the carboxylate prevent the structure to extend laterally as easily
as when tiny cadmium acetate is present in solution.

After 10
min, the excitonic peaks that we identified at 5 min are
clearly present, slightly red-shifted, and more pronounced. The red
shift is consistent with the lateral extension of the 2D NPLs so that
the lateral confinement of the exciton decreases. Two additional peaks
corresponding to the light hole–electron transitions for two-
and three-ML NPLs are now clearly visible. The TEM examination shows
rodlike structures with lateral dimensions of few nanometers. At this
stage, it is still very hard to assert with TEM that NPLs are formed.
The absorption spectra, however, unambiguously show that the sample
contains 2D structures with precisely defined thicknesses of two and
three CdSe MLs. We thus conclude that most of these rodlike structures
have very well-defined thicknesses, slightly similar to wires. As
the reaction proceeds, we observe a shape refinement process during
the lateral growth as the initial small undefined NPLs slowly grew
into well-defined rectangular-shaped NPLs (e.g., TEM image at 30 min).
At this stage, the absorption spectra of the aliquot show the characteristics
of two-ML and three-ML thick NPLs with positions at 390 and 460 nm,
showing that the lateral dimensions of the NPLs are larger than 7
nm, the Bohr diameter of the 2D exciton.29 As the reaction proceeds at 175 °C, we observe on the absorption
spectra that the two-ML thick population disappears, whereas the three-ML
population continues to grow steadily. This means that the growth
of NPLs occurs not only laterally to gain a well-defined shape but
also that under these conditions, two-ML thick NPLs are not stable
and dissolve. After 2.5 h, almost all the two-ML NPLs were converted
to three MLs. This is in agreement with the growth model that predicts
that a rapid growth of two-ML NPLs would eventually lead to slow formation
of thicker NPLs at high temperature and long reaction times.24

The TEM pictures observed in Figure 5 combined with the
absorption spectra taken during
the NPL formation show that ill-defined wormlike structures possess
absorption features that correspond precisely to the absorption of
colloidal structures with 1D confinement. How do those wormlike structures
form and how they can transform into well-defined NPLs remain an open
question. We could not find any evidence of single dot formation,
and these 2D embryos are very different from the ones observed recently
in Chen et al.18 As we mentioned earlier,
in our case, the mixture composed of cadmium octanoate and TOPSe is
perfectly soluble in ODE under the reaction conditions used, and no
aggregation can be observed. To check if soft templating of CdC8 in the ODE hydrocarbon chain could play a role in the formation
of NPLs at least in the early stages, we performed SAXS and WAXS analyses
of CdC8 in ODE at different temperatures. By heating the
precursor solution (e.g., CCdC8 = 0.1 mol/L shown in Figure 6) and recording SAXS/WAXS patterns at different temperatures,
we measured peak locations corresponding to each temperature ramp
and plotted diagrams of temperature versus wave vector q (nm–1). On the basis of these diagrams, we were
able to determine the appearance of liquid-crystal phases of CdC8 and their transition temperatures. We observe that CdC8 forms columnar structures in ODE that can exist up to ≈185
°C for a concentration of CCdC8 = 0.1 mol/L, but there is no signal corresponding to any mesophase
acquired above 190 °C. In spite of this absence of any ordered
structures above 190 °C, we could synthesize CdSe NPLs with an
injection of TOPSe at 200 °C and even 225 °C (Figure 2). This excludes the necessity
of a lamellar structure for synthesizing CdSe NPLs in the absence
of acetate salts. Complementary SAXS/WAXS experiment (Figure S4) shows that lowering CCdC8 to 0.005 mol/L causes the formation of
a lamellar structure that exists up to 180 °C, as indicated by
the peaks in the scattering patterns at wave vectors q*, 2q*, and 3q* (2.64, 5.35, and
8.02 nm–1). This means that the phase behavior of
the cadmium carboxylate in ODE depends on its concentration in the
organic solvent. In the case of CdC10 and CdC14 at a concentration of 0.1 mol/L in ODE, both precursor solutions
do not show mesophase transitions before melting into the liquid phase
(Figure S5) at temperatures higher than
100 °C. Similarly, NPLs could be obtained with CdC10 in ODE and TOPSe injected at temperatures higher than 100 °C.
This analysis confirms that CdSe NPLs can be synthesized in a completely
soluble mixture without acetate.

Figure 6 SAXS/WAXS patterns acquired during the
heating of the precursor
solution (CdC8 in ODE, CCdC8 = 0.1 mol/L) from 30 to 190 °C and its corresponding
plot of temperature vs q (nm–1).

What could then be the driving
mechanism for the formation of 2D
structures? We have shown that soft templating could be ruled out
in our case. We also do not observe in TEM small seeds together with
NPL as previously shown in the case of oriented attachment. Finally,
the recent formation mechanism driven by insolubility is not consistent
with the fact that we do not observe an insoluble material in our
solution during the onset of NPL formation. We suggest that ligand
packing density and steric hindrance due to packing could play a significant
role for the formation of ZB CdSe NPLs. Indeed, we observe that in
the absence of short-chain cadmium ligands, the NPLs form as elongated,
thin, wirelike structures without uniform lateral extension. We propose
that as it has been discussed for CdSe magic-sized clusters,30 the packing density of long alkyl chain carboxylate
on the cadmium-rich [100] facets (the larger surfaces of the NPLs)
cannot match the density of cadmium atoms on these surfaces. Because
NPLs have a large amount of cations (n + 1 cadmium
planes for n selenium planes), they require negatively
charged ligands to counterbalance their positive charge. This balance
equilibrium can be obtained if two carboxylates can bind every cadmium
atom in excess. We hypothesize that this can be done only if short-chain
ligands such as cadmium acetate are present during the synthesis.
When cadmium acetate is added in the synthesis with CdC8, indeed large 2D objects are obtained with unrestricted lateral
extension (Figure S6). We also found that
by simply adjusting the chain length of short carboxylate ligands,
it is possible to modify the steric hindrance and ligand packing under
the same experimental conditions, thus tuning the lateral extension
of the ZB CdSe NPLs (Figure S7). Further
studies are in progress to test this hypothesis.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we show that it is possible to synthesize CdSe NPLs
from pure long cadmium carboxylate without the addition of any short-chain
ligands. The effects of several experimental parameters are studied.
We hypothesize that the steric hindrance caused by ligand packing
should affect the growth of NPLs. Such a hypothesis could lead to
a better understanding of the formation mechanism of 2D nanostructures.
Our study highlights the diversity of formation mechanisms that can
lead to the NPL depending on the reaction conditions and the type
of the precursor used.

spectroscopy are performed using a UV visible spectrometer (Shimadzu,
UV3600) and a PL spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon HORIBA, Fluoromax-3). TEM
imaging is done using JEOL 2010.

Quantum Yield Measurement
The quantum yield (QY) of
as-synthesized three-ML CdSe NPLs was measured using a comparative
method with an organic fluorophore (rhodamine 6G). Absorption and
emission spectra were acquired at different concentrations, and QY
was calculated following the equation:  where n is the refractive
index of the solvent, I is the integrated fluorescence
intensity, and A is the absorbance at the excitation
wavelength.

Small-/Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering
SAXS/WAXS experiments
were performed at the ID2 beamline at the ESRF (European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) using an in-capillary heating-up
method.
