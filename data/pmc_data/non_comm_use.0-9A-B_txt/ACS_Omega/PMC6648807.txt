Poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA)–ZnS composite films were prepared
by varying the composition of PVA ranging from 1–5 wt % through
a simple solvent casting method. The photocatalytic enactment of the
composites was evaluated along with the investigations of their photoluminescence
(PL), optical transparency, morphology, and thermal properties. The
firm interaction between the ZnS and PVA was confirmed by Fourier
transform infrared, UV–vis, and PL spectroscopies. PVA–ZnS
composites showed enhanced luminescence property than
PVA. The composites exhibited very good optical transparency regardless
of the amount of PVA addition. The thermogravimetric analysis data
indeed exhibited better thermal stability of the composites. The glass
transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature
(Tm), enthalpy of melting (ΔHm), and crystallinity were evaluated for such
composites. The composites demonstrated morphological variations depending
on the amount of PVA addition, although the particle size of ZnS remained
similar in the nanometer range (50–120 nm) for all composite
samples. The prepared composite films exhibited superior photocatalytic
performance in the degradation of methylene blue compared with the
bare ZnS and PVA. This study may give a new insight into the fabrication
of PVA–ZnS photocatalysts for the treatment of organic pollutants.

1 Introduction
The
presence of harmful organic dyes in water affects the aquatic
environment and human health and decreases the drinking water quality.
To alleviate this problem, several methods and materials have been
employed to remove organic dyes from the wastewater.1−4 Among the several methods, photocatalysis is considered to be one
of the most promising technology because of its simplicity, low cost,
and relatively high efficiency.1,5 In this context, the
design and fabrication of new materials similar to polymer composites
for the removal of organic dyes is a matter of great practical importance.
Polymers consisting of inorganic nanoparticles embedded in a transparent
host matrix have the ability to fabricate unique properties such as
optical, thermal, and high dielectric constant properties for precise
applications such as sensors, photoelectric conversion, and photocatalysts.6−8 Among the organic polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been used
extensively for the preparation of nanocomposites because of its easy
processability, an extremely hydrophilic nature, good film-forming
capability, and optical transparency. Besides, the solubility of PVA
in an aqueous medium makes the incorporated nanoparticles be easily
dispersed in the solvent, thus making the nanocomposite preparation
almost nontoxic. PVA was widely employed as a host matrix for various
nanofillers.9,10 PVA was successfully used as
a suitable polymeric substrate for the photocatalytic wastewater treatment.11 The synthesis of PVA in the film form with promising
functionalities can be easily performed by a simple solvent casting
method.12 Such a synthesis technique is
very useful for the introduction of various dopant materials into
the PVA matrix to improvise properties such as optical, morphological,
thermal, photoluminescence (PL), and photocatalytic activity. So far,
different photocatalytic materials including semiconductors such as
TiO2, ZnO, AgBr, and AgCO3 have been efficiently
used to degrade organic dyes.13−15 Among the semiconductors, ZnS
is a very promising material and it has been applied as a compelling
catalyst for the photodegradation of organic dyes.16 Further, ZnS has a wide band gap (3.91 eV) and has a very
good photocarrier generation capability. Such properties of ZnS may
improve the efficiency of a catalyst when it forms composites with
polymers. Relating to other applications of ZnS, it has already been
used in the field of electroluminescence, biodevices, optical coatings,
light-emitting diodes, photoconductors, and so on.17

Thus, the addition of ZnS into a host material similar
to PVA can
increase the properties such as morphological, thermal, optical, luminescence,
and photocatalytic activity of newly formed composites than its polymer.
Additionally, the presence of ZnS on the PVA as a host matrix may
have the ability to inhibit the recombination of electron–hole
pairs which turn to be a good photocatalyst as a composite.18 However, only very few research studies can
be seen in the literature, where ZnS was used with PVA to modify the
mechanical, structural, and optical properties without demonstrating
any applications.19,20 In this context, the addition
of ZnS onto PVA to prepare PVA–ZnS composites may be interesting
for its dye degradation properties to use in wastewater treatment
along with improvising properties such as thermal, PL, optical transparency,
morphological, and their interaction study.

To the best of our
knowledge, there have been no reports on the
synthesis of PVA–ZnS composite films by a simple solvent casting
method for photocatalytic dye degradation in wastewater treatment
application. The present study reports the photodegradation of methylene
blue (MB) as a model pollutant under solar illumination. Further,
there has been no report on the modification of luminescence, optical
transparency, and thermal properties along with the morphological
variations of PVA with the help of ZnS. Here, we report a simple solvent
casting method for the preparation PVA–ZnS nanocomposite films
at room temperature, and their photocatalytic activity toward the
degradation of MB under sunlight irradiation for wastewater treatment
application. The enhanced PL, optical transparency, and thermal properties
of the prepared composites along with their morphological variations
have also been reported in the present work.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 FTIR Spectra and Analysis
The incorporation
of ZnS into PVA matrix can be attributed with Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopic analysis of the PVA and PVA–ZnS composite
samples, as presented in Figure 1. The detailed labeling of the peaks of PVA and a composite
sample (for instance, PVA–ZnS-3) are shown in Figure S1. A broad and strong absorption peak observed between
3000 and 3600 cm–1, peaking at 3385 cm–1, is the characteristic of the −OH functional group present
in PVA. Such a vibrational peak originates from the intermolecular
and intramolecular hydrogen bonds in PVA. The peak observed at 2942
cm–1 corresponds to the C–H stretching vibrations
of −CH2– skeleton. The C=C stretching
and C=O stretching mode peaks are identified at 1734 and 1654
cm–1, respectively. A strong band at 1093 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of the
oxygen-containing functional group C–O in the C–O–H
groups. The bands at 1437 and 1377 cm–1 are assigned
to the bending and wagging vibrations of CH2 groups, respectively.
Thus, all of the characteristic peaks of PVA (Table 1) match well with the previous reports.6,21 Similar characteristic peaks of PVA is also visible for all of the
PVA–ZnS composite samples; however, the frequency of the symmetrical
stretching vibration of the −OH group shifted to a higher wave
number (3401–3414 cm–1) than that of the
PVA film. Such a shifting indicates the insertion of ZnS particle
into PVA which had a significant influence on the bonding interactions
within the PVA structural framework.22 The
possible mode of interaction between ZnS and polymer can be the hydrogen
bonding between −OH group of PVA and the sulfur (S) in ZnS.
The probable hydrogen bonding pattern is shown in Figure S2. The modification of spectra of the symmetrical
stretching vibration of hydroxyl group for all PVA–ZnS composite
samples shifted to a higher wave number (3401–3414 cm–1) than that of the PVA film (Figure 1). The position appears to be shifted because of the
slight elongation of the O–H bond because of its hydrogen bond
formation with the sulfur of ZnS. All of these results designate the
incorporation of ZnS in the PVA structure.

2.2 UV–Vis
and XRD Studies
The
interaction of ZnS with PVA in PVA–ZnS composite films and
their corresponding band gap were computed through UV–vis studies
(Figure 2). The composite
films demonstrate absorption band around at 212 nm, whereas PVA shows
its characteristic band at 189 nm.6 Such
differences of the absorption band between PVA and its composite with
ZnS can be attributed to the bathochromic shift or red shift of PVA
and imply the strong interactions between them. Similar absorption
peaks because of the interaction of PVA with other inorganic materials
were also previously observed in ref (23). Relating to the band gap calculation of PVA–ZnS
composite films and bare ZnS, the absorption maxima were identified
in the range of 211.5–213 and 215 nm, respectively. The band
gap of all samples was computed using the following equation  where E, h, c, and λ denote the band gap energy,
Planck’s
constant, the velocity of light, and the corresponding wavelength
of absorption maxima, respectively.

composite films; inset
(b) ZnS and (c) PVA film. (d) Corresponding magnified spectra of PVA–ZnS
composites in the wavelength range between 200 and 350 nm.

The calculated band gap of the composite samples
was 5.82–5.86
eV, whereas the value for ZnS is 3.91 eV. Such a band gap of ZnS corresponds
well with the literature reported value.24 It can be assumed from the band gap of composite samples that the
interaction of ZnS with PVA had a considerable effect on the absorption
of light. The absorption maxima of PVA–ZnS composite films
increase and consequently their band gap upturns. For composite films,
the increase of absorption maxima to the visible region may be attributed
to the increment of light absorption by ZnS.25 Such a phenomenon directs to the assumption that the inducement
of ZnS may help to improve the photodegradation of capability of PVA–ZnS
composite films than PVA only.

To determine the crystal structure,
the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analysis of the synthesized ZnS was conducted, and the corresponding
XRD pattern is shown in Figure 3. The crystal structure of the ZnS was found to be matching
to the reported ZnS (JCPDS card no 36-1450). The diffraction planes
(100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), and (201)
correspond to hexagonal crystalline ZnS.26 The cell parameters and the volume obtained from the XRD pattern
of the ZnS samples are a = 3.984(1) Å, b = 6.264(2) Å, and V = 79.684 Å3. Thus, the component phase of the sample was resolute to
be wurtzite-type ZnS with a trace amount of Zn, NaCl, and Na2SO4. Such a hexagonal structure of ZnS corresponds well
with its calculated band gap.27

of synthesized ZnS sample.

2.3 PL Properties
Further evidence of
the interaction between ZnS and PVA can be ascertained by PL measurements. Figure 4 shows the room-temperature
PL spectra of PVA and PVA–ZnS composite films at an excitation
wavelength of 350 nm. PVA exhibited a sharp PL emission in the visible
region of 320–400 nm, peaking at 340 nm [Figure 4, inset (a)]. Such an emission can be attributed
to the π* → n electronic transition of the −OH
groups for isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic modes of PVA, which
likely depends on their spatial arrangement within the PVA molecules.23,28 The emission spectrum of ZnS appears as broadened and centered around
398 nm as can be seen from the inset (b) of Figure 4. This emission originates from the sulfur
vacancies located at the surface of ZnS.29 Similar emission of ZnS because of surface defect states such as
sulfur vacancies was reported by other researchers.30,31 In the case of PVA–ZnS composites, two prominent peaks observed
at 397–408 and 430–435 nm can be attributed to the transitions
in syndiotactic (s) and isotactic (i) PVA, respectively. Thus, a red-shifting
of peak emission is observed for all composite samples compared to
PVA, which reveals broadband blue emission. These results evidenced
the incorporation of ZnS into PVA, and such a presence of ZnS comprehensively
reorder the delocalized n-electrons of −OH
groups in the PVA backbone. These results are consistent with the
previous reports.6,22 The observed blue emission in
the composites could be related to the recombination process of electrons
between the sulfur vacancy donor level and the holes trapped at the
zinc vacancy acceptor level.32 Such donor–acceptor-type
materials (ZnS) also effect on the Stokes shift of PVA–ZnS
composites. It was found that the Stokes shifts of PVA and PVA–ZnS
composites are 151 and 185.5–196 nm, respectively. Similar
larger Stokes shift of the PVA and PVA-based materials were observed
and explained in ref (33). Furthermore, looking at the PL spectra, it can be seen that the
intensity increases for all composite samples compared to PVA (Figure 4). Such a raise could
be because of the fact that the n-type ZnS can trap electrons as well
as permit more holes to recombine through the interface of PVA and
ZnS. From the above results, it is possible to speculate that the
prepared PVA–ZnS composite films can be a promising material
for light-emitting diode and solar cell.

2.4 Optical
Transparency
The optical
transparency of the PVA–ZnS composite films was assessed from
their UV–vis spectra (see Figure 2). To understand the optical transmission,
the samples were investigated in the wavelength range of 200–800
nm. It was found that the absorbance started to become zero after
400 nm (Figure 2).
These results reveal a very good optical transparency for all composites
in the visible light range.34 Such a high
clearness may allow the PVA–ZnS composite films to be used
as polarizer films in electrical devices.

To deepen the study
of optical transparency, the optical photograph of all of the composite
films was captured, as shown in Figure 5. The film thickness is around 140 μm and was
positioned on the color characters printed on a paper. It can be seen
that the composite films are very good andf optically transparent
regardless of the amount (wt %) of PVA addition.

PVA–ZnS composite films. Panels a–e
correspond to the composite samples synthesized at different additions
of PVA (1–5 wt %).

2.5 Thermal Properties
The thermal degradation
possessions of PVA and PVA–ZnS composites were determined using
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Figure 6. Both PVA and PVA–ZnS composites
exhibited a four-stage decomposition process, resulting in four separate
stages of weight loss under the nitrogen atmosphere (Table 2). The initial degradation was
identified at 27–144 and 25–174 °C, and their corresponding
weight losses were observed at 7.3 and 8.1–12.6% for PVA and
composite samples, respectively. Such a loss is attributable to the
evaporation of moisture and partial dehydration of PVA chains.35

a The samples, decomposition

% of weight loss, and residual weight for different samples are listed.

The second degradation is located
between 218 and 406 and between
143 and 372 °C, and the weight losses are 44.6 and 39–42.5%
for PVA and composites, which is caused by the heating arrangement
of the polymer structure.36 The third disintegration
temperature of PVA and composites is 408–492 and 348–494
°C corresponding to the decomposition temperature of the PVA
structure.37 The mass loss for this step
is 29.8% for PVA, and it significantly decreased for all of the composite
samples providing the values 15.9–22.7% which indicate a better
thermal stability of composites than that of PVA. The reason for better
thermal stability is due to the incorporation of ZnS with PVA in the
case of composite samples. The inclusion of ZnS into the PVA matrix
may restrict the motions of polymer chains resulting in the decrease
of weight loss in the composites and undergoes a slow degradation
process.38 These results match well with
the improvement of the thermal stability nature of composites because
of the interaction of inorganic oxides and polymer.6 Among the composite samples, no significant variation of
weight losses was observed, except for the sample (PVA–ZnS-1)
prepared from the lowest addition of PVA (1 wt %). Therefore, the
PVA–ZnS-1 shows the highest thermal stability than other composites.
For PVA, the final weight loss occurred at 495–812 °C.
However, for the composites, the temperature range is 483–835
°C and the decomposition ends at a comparatively higher temperature
than PVA. The disintegration of such a step was caused by the further
decomposition of polymer structure which subsequently undergoes decomposition
resulting in the formation of carbonaceous matter and remains constant
giving the plateau approach in the TGA curve.39

The residual mass of the PVA–ZnS composites was observed
from their TGA data, which was assessed to be 2.1–6.7%, whereas
for the PVA films, the identified mass was extremely low at 0.9%.
The residual mass shows the presence of alkenes, other organic compounds,
and nondegraded polymer chains.36 The higher
residual mass present in the case of composite samples may be because
of the fact that inorganic ZnS can act as a catalyst surface which
prevents the degradation process or simply the interaction of ZnS
with PVA chain made the composites prohibited to the condensation–degradation
reaction. Thus, the TGA results suggest that the incorporation of
ZnS has significantly improved the thermal stability of PVA–ZnS
composites. Among the composite samples, the higher residual mass
of 6.7% was observed for PVA–ZnS-1 composites, further indicating
its higher thermal stability nature.

Figure 7 shows the
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves (heating and cooling
cycle) of PVA and PVA–ZnS composites, emphasizing their glass
transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature
(Tm), melting enthalpy (ΔHm), and crystalline behavior, as listed in Table 3. Three endothermic
peaks were identified for all samples. The first peak was assigned
to the Tg identified at 38.5 and 37.5–39
°C for PVA and PVA–ZnS composites. For PVA, the Tg is lower than that of its general value because
of the presence of moisture.40 It can be
found that there is no evident change in the Tg value for PVA and composite samples. The second endothermic
peak was found at 85 and 78.3–102 °C for PVA and composites,
respectively. Such a peak is assigned to the removal of free (moisture)
and hydrogen-bonded water.6 The exothermic
peak was also observed for both PVA and composites samples. The third
peak corresponds to the melting temperature (Tm) identified at 190 °C for PVA (Figure 7b). For composites, the Tm lies in the range of 184–187 °C. Therefore,
there was no significant variation of Tm observed among the composites but a slight variation (∼3–6
°C) with PVA (Figure 7b). Such a melting temperature of PVA being almost unaffected
by the ZnS demonstrates that the interaction with ZnS occurred through
the amorphous section of the polymer and was exempted or very minor
inducement to the crystalline part.22 A
similar behavior of the melting temperature between PVA and its composites
was reported in the literature.41 Additionally,
the slight decrease in melting temperature may be because of the decrease
of crystallinity of the composites.

composite films.

The degree of crystallinity
was calculated using the equation (ΔHm/ΔHm0) ×100.6 The ΔHm is
the measured enthalpy of melting obtained
from DSC thermogram, and ΔHm°
is the enthalpy of melting for 100% crystalline PVA (taken as 138.6
J/g).42 The value of ΔHm for PVA was 29.02 J/g. This value decreases
to 14.88 from 23.09 J/g for composites corresponding to the decrease
of the degree of crystallinity. The calculated value of the degree
of crystallinity of all samples is listed in Table 3. The crystallinity of PVA was 20.94%, whereas
for the composites, the values lie in the range of 10.34–16.66%.
Such a decrease of crystallinity indicates the reality of interactions
between PVA and ZnS which turn to the impairment of interactions among
polymer chains.43 The possible interactions
between two materials are hydrogen bonds between S of ZnS and O atom
in PVA (see FTIR discussion).

2.6 Morphology
Study
The morphological
features of the synthesized composites were assessed from their field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. For instance, the typical
FESEM images of the composites obtained from 1, 3, and 5 wt % are
presented in Figure 8a,c,e. From the images, it can be seen that the composites are composed
of nanostructures with the diameter in the range of a nanometer scale.
For more clarity, the higher magnification images of the corresponding
samples are shown in Figure 8b,d,f. For the lower amount of PVA addition (1 and 2 wt %),
most of the spherical-shaped ZnS particles are individually well-distributed
among the PVA matrix. The representative image is shown in Figure 8a, and its corresponding
higher magnification image is located in Figure 8b. For the further increment of PVA addition
to 3–5 wt %, the ZnS nanoparticles are being severely aggregated
forming a flowerlike structure in the PVA matrix. For instance, Figure 8c,e represents such
images captured from the composite samples of 3 and 5 wt % addition.
The flowerlike structures are more clearly visible in Figure 8d,f. Thus, for the higher addition
of PVA, the aggregation of ZnS particles is dominating compared to
the lower addition. Nonetheless, whatever the amount of PVA addition,
the particle size of the ZnS remains similar for all composite samples
which lie in the range of 50–120 nm.

composite films and its (b)
high magnification, (c) PVA–ZnS-3 composite films and its (d)
high magnification, and (e) PVA–ZnS-5 composite films and its
(f) high magnification.

To deepen the study of the interaction of ZnS with PVA along
with
morphological observations, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements
were performed for the composite samples. For instance, Figure 9 shows the EDX spectrum of
PVA–ZnS-1 composite films. The peaks of Zn and S along with
C and O in the spectrum confirm their presence in the composites and
agree well with the FTIR and UV–vis data. It can be seen for
the PVA–ZnS-1 composites that the atomic % of Zn and S are
18.14 and 12.92, respectively (inset of Figure 9). The EDS data of the other four composite
samples are presented in Figure S3.

2.7 Photocatalytic Performance
The photocatalytic
capability of ZnS, PVA, and all PVA–ZnS composite samples was
investigated by the photodegradation of organic dye MB through direct
sunlight irradiation. We also corroborated the water resistivity of
composite films in different temperatures. We observed that the PVA–ZnS
composite films are resistant to water until 66 °C, which is
below the temperature originating from the sunlight shining. The time-dependent
UV–vis absorption spectra representing the degradation of MB
in the presence of bare ZnS, PVA, and PVA–ZnS composite films
as a photocatalyst are presented in Figures 10 and 11, respectively.
The decreasing of absorption bands exhibits an effective removal of
MB on the respective samples. Figure 10a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of MB
solution comprising 20 mg of bare ZnS under the sunlight irradiation
for different time interims. The absorption maxima decrease gradually
with the increasing of illumination time, and 73% removal occurred
after 660 min of time duration. The percentage of removal with respect
to exposure time to the sunlight for all samples is plotted in Figure 12. The absorbance
at 664 nm was changed very slowly for MB solution in the absence of
photocatalyst ZnS on sunlight irradiation (see Figure S4). It was apparent that only 26% removal was completed
after the same time (660 min) span similar to ZnS. Such a result indicates
the good photocatalyticability of ZnS under sunlight. In the case
of PVA film, after a time span of 660 min, 63% removal of MB was occurred
indicating its low degradation capacity (Figure 10b).

films.

Figure 12 Photodegradation of MB in the presence
of ZnS, PVA, and different
PVA–ZnS composite samples.

Further, PVA–ZnS composites were employed as a photocatalyst
under the same experimental conditions to compare the photocatalytic
performance with the bare ZnS and PVA. It is evident from Figure 11a–e that
there is a perceptible decrease in the absorption maxima for all of
the PVA–ZnS composite samples. The absorption maxima decrease
gradually with the increase of exposure time showing a substantial
blue shift, and it finally reaches near zero after 660 min of solar
irradiation. Nonetheless, no significant variation of the absorption
maxima was observed among the composite samples (Figure 11a–e). The observed
blue shift in the absorption maxima of the composites demonstrates
the gradual adsorption of MB to the samples and finally reaches toward
its complete degradation. Such PVA–ZnS composite films are
reusable up to 3 times for the removal of MB, as shown in Figure S5. The decomposition of MB from its conjugate
structure was confirmed by observing the following phenomenon: (i)
the color changes in the reaction mixture from blue to light blue
and finally turned into colorless and (ii) the apparent shifting of
the absorption band from 664 to 662 nm. Two realities may ensue for
the removal of MB from the aqueous solution: one is the degradation
process and another is the interaction of MB with the samples resulting
in their aggregation and precipitating out as a separate phase. At
the present situation, we could not exclude either of these possibilities.
The PVA–ZnS composite films are also able to degrade the colorless
organic compound (for instance, phenol) as the absorption maxima decreases
gradually with respect to time under sunlight irradiation (see Figure S6).

The comparison among ZnS, PVA,
and PVA–ZnS composites shows
that the photocatalytic activity of PVA–ZnS composite films
is higher than bare ZnS and PVA. Such results corroborate that composites
have excellent ability to degrade organic dyes than the ZnS and PVA
alone. Thus, a significant synergistic enhancement effect of the photocatalyst
was observed for PVA–ZnS composites. The absorption coefficient
of PVA–ZnS increases compared to ZnS and PVA in the visible
region because of the strong interaction of ZnS with PVA matrix. Additionally,
such interaction may weaken the hydrogen bonding in PVA chain and
may form a layer of ZnS structure in the surface of the PVA film.
This observation is supported by the FESEM images of the PVA–ZnS
composite films (Figure 8). Such an interaction and development of layer on the surface of
the PVA matrix may have advantages to significantly increase the photoabsorption
of PVA–ZnS composites and thus increasing their photocatalytic
ability. The similar effect of ZnS on the degradation of MB was reported
by other researchers.4,25

2.8 Photocatalytic
Mechanism
In the degradation
process of organic dye similar to MB, the active species containing
holes, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radicals are generated under
the sunlight irradiation. Generally, in the presence of oxygen, the
irradiated nanoparticles can destroy many organic pollutants. A possible
mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation process for PVA–ZnS
composite films is illustrated in Figure 13. Under solar (hυ)
illumination, ZnS is induced to generate electron–hole charge
pairs.  

Figure 13 Schematic diagram of the photocatalytic process through the PVA–ZnS
nanocomposite films under sunlight irradiation.

The photoinduced electrons on the valence band (VB) edges
are excited
and migrate to the conduction band (CB) edges, generating holes on
the VB (Figure 13).
The generated holes in the VB react directly with the organic pollutants
(MB) or with the surrounding water molecules to generate hydroxyl
radicals (•OH). The electrons assembling on the
CB react with the surrounding water and oxygen molecules to generate
hydroxyl (•OH) and superoxide radicals (•O2–). In such a way, generated radicals
and holes are able to contribute significantly to the degradation
of MB and other organic pollutants. During the degradation process
of MB, the presence of oxygen (O2) can inhibit the undesirable
recombination of electron–hole charge pair. The unique electron–hole
charge-pair transfer can make the ability of a photocatalyst to be
in its excellent performance. In the ultimate reaction of the photodegradation
of MB, the final products of the reaction are CO2 and H2O.25 When ZnS incorporates into
the PVA structure, the ZnS layer may help in the adsorption of MB
on the surface of catalysts and improve the photocatalytic performance
of the composites than that of the polymer. Thus, the above results
confirm that PVA–ZnS composites can work as an efficient photocatalyst
for dye degradation for textile and wastewater treatment applications.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
PVA (Mw = 72 000), sodium thiosulfate
(Na2S2O3), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and MB were purchased
from Merck. Acetone ((CH3)2CO, ≥99.5%)
was procured from Sigma–Aldrich. All of the reagents were of
analytic grade and were used as received.

3.2 Synthesis
of PVA–ZnS Nanocomposite
Films
PVA–ZnS nanocomposite films were fabricated
by a simple solvent casting technique.12 Similarly, ZnS films were prepared without the addition of PVA.
In a typical procedure, a known amount of PVA (wt %) was dissolved
in 25 mL of double distilled water and heated at 60 °C through
continuous stirring for 1 h until the polymer became completely soluble.
Thereafter, 0.01 M (10 mL) ZnCl2 was added to the prepared
PVA solution. The mixture (PVA and ZnCl2) was stirred for
2 h at 60 °C. Then, 0.01 M (10 mL) Na2S2O3 solution was added to the PVA-capped ZnCl2 reaction mixture and stirred for another 2 h. Eventually, the composite
films were obtained through casting by pouring the solution into a
glass plate. The schematic formation of PVA–ZnS composite films
is shown in Scheme 1. The homogeneous films were obtained after drying at room temperature
for at least 48 h. The prepared films are free from air bubbles and
uniformly dispersed ZnS particles. Five different synthesis batches
were prepared in a similar way by varying the composition of PVA ranging
from 1 to 5 wt %.

3.3 Characterization
Transmission FTIR
measurements of PVA and PVA–ZnS nanocomposites were carried
out between 400 and 4000 cm–1 using Shimadzu FTIR
prestige 21 spectrometers through the KBr pellet method. The UV–vis
spectra and the absorbance of dye in solution were obtained on Shimadzu
UV-1800 spectrometer with the range of 200–800 nm. The crystalline
structure of the sample was determined from X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern using Cu Kα radiation (model-3040 X'pert PRO, Philips). The
luminescence characteristics were investigated by PL spectroscopy
at room temperature using on Shimadzu RF-3501pc spectrofluorometer.
The morphological investigation and elemental composition of the films
were attained through scanning electron microscopy images recorded
on a JEOL JSM 7600F FESEM equipped with an EDX. The sample preparation
was performed through platinum coating before the measurement. The
thermal properties were evaluated by TGA and DSC. TGA curves were
obtained by measuring 4.0 mg of a sample using a Shimadzu TGA-50 thermogravimetric
analyzer maintaining the heating temperature range between 30 and
850 °C at a rate of 20 °C min–1 under
N2 atmosphere. DSC measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu
TA-60A instrument, following heating and cooling rate at 10 °C
min–1 in the temperature range of 30–250
°C under nitrogen flow (20 mL/min).

3.4 Photocatalytic
Experiments
The photocatalytic
ability of PVA–ZnS nanocomposite films was assessed by the
degradation of MB in aqueous media through sunlight illumination.
The experiments were performed for all samples at the same time to
ensure a similar irradiation power of sunlight. In a typical procedure,
20 mg of the photocatalyst sample was suspended in MB solution (C0 = 2 mg L–1). Before placing
it to sunlight irradiation, the reaction mixture was magnetically
stirred for 30 min in a dark place to attain absorption–desorption
equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the organic dye. Continuous
stirring was maintained after subsequent sunlight irradiation to reach
the photocatalyst particles suspended throughout the measurements.
After certain time intervals of solar illumination, the aliquots of
the mixture were removed for centrifugation which was accomplished
at 3000 rpm for 20 min to separate the solid photocatalyst. After
centrifugation, the collected supernatant was allowed for UV–vis
measurements to observe the adsorption and degradation behavior of
MB. The distinctive absorption band of MB at 664 nm was applied to
calculate the percentage of dye removal. The degradation efficiency
was determined using the method earlier reported in ref (44).

4 Conclusions
PVA–ZnS composite films were prepared
through a simple solvent
casting method with improved photocatalytic performance. The strong
host–filler interaction was confirmed by FTIR, UV–vis,
and PL spectroscopy. PL data indeed showed a notable enhancement of
the luminescence property of the PVA–ZnS composites. The optical
transparency was very good for all composites. Relating to the decomposition
temperature of PVA, a significant decrease in weight loss (15.9–22.7%)
was observed for the composites compared with PVA (29.8%). Such a
decrease of weight loss revealed better thermal stability of composites.
The glass transition temperature (Tg)
and the melting temperature (Tm) of PVA
were almost unaffected by ZnS. However, the degree of crystallinity
of composites was decreased, which further demonstrated the reality
of interaction of ZnS with PVA chain. The morphological modification
of the composites was realized with the variation of PVA addition.
The as-synthesized composites exhibited improved photocatalytic performance
through the photodegradation of MB because of the incorporation of
ZnS into PVA matrix. All of these results will not only give a promising
insight into the modification of PL, morphology, and thermal properties
of PVA-based ZnS composites, but also exhibit a great prospect for
the fabrication of PVA–ZnS photocatalysts for the treatment
of organic pollutants.
