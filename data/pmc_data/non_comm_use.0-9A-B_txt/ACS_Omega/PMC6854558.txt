Alkali lignin is
a component of the waste black liquor produced
by the paper-making industry that is difficult to degrade. In recent
years, the biological activities of lignin, such as free-radical scavenging
and antioxidant capacity, have received increasing attention. Here,
we prepared H3PW12O40/ZrO2 and used this catalyst together with the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride ([BMIM]Cl) as a double-effect catalyst for the degradation
of alkali lignin. Single-factor and orthogonal tests showed that the
best degradation conditions were as follows: reaction time, 2 h; reaction
temperature, 100 °C; mass ratio of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 to lignin, 1:4; and substrate concentration,
2.5%. The phenolic hydroxyl group content of the lignin degradation
product increased by 231.2% and the total hydroxyl group content increased
by 337.1% when the double-effect catalyst was used rather than [BMIM]Cl
alone. Analysis by gel permeation chromatography showed that both
the weight-average molecular weight and the number-average molecular
weight of the product were reduced and that the lignin was degraded
into small-molecular-weight compounds by the macromolecule. The product
after the catalytic degradation of lignin showed a markedly increased
antioxidant capacity, which was similar to that of the commercial
antioxidant, 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The study opens up a
new direction for the better utilization of lignin.

Introduction
Heteropoly acids, which consist of water,
organic molecules, and
heteropoly anions and cations (protons, metal cations, organic cations),
can be classified into several structural types: Keggin type (ratio
of the central metal atom to heteroatoms is 1:12), Dawson type (ratio
of central metal atoms to heteroatoms is 2:18), Waugh type (ratio
of the central metal atom to heteroatoms is 1:9), Silver type, and
Anderson type. The primary structure of a heteropoly acid refers to
the structure of the heteropoly anion, for example [XM12O40]n− (X = P, Si,
Ge, etc.; M = W, Mo, V, etc.), and describes the constituent elements
of the heteropoly anion, their number, and the structure of the skeleton.
The crystal structure of a combination of polyanions and counterions
defines the secondary structure of a heteropoly acid, in which multiple
secondary structural units form a heteropoly compound unit, which
determines the acidity, redox properties, and polar properties of
the heteropoly acid in solution.1,2 S0olubility, catalytic
activity, and selectivity in the medium are affected by the point
charge, electronegativity, and radius. The tertiary structure of heteropoly
acids refers to the aggregation of polyanions, counterions, and crystal
water in three-dimensional space. H3PW12O40·5H2O is used as an example to introduce
the concept of first-, second-, and third-order structures of heteropoly
acids (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Primary,
secondary, and tertiary structures of H3PW12O40·5H2O.

A Keggin-type space accumulation structure was first described
for Na3[PW12O40]·5H2O (Figure 2), and
Keggin-type structures remain the most frequently studied of the heteropoly
acid structural types described above.

Figure 2 Diagram showing the space
stacking structure of Keggin-type heteropoly
anions.

Because heteropoly acids contain both complexes
and metal oxides,
they have both acidic and redox properties and can, therefore, be
used as acidic catalysts, redox catalysts, and dual-function catalysts.

Ionic liquids, such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl),
which are organic salts that are liquids at room temperature or close
to room temperature, have long been of great scientific and technological
interest because of their unique properties. Ionic liquids are green
solvents and have recently become increasingly popular for catalytic
reactions.3 In contrast to other organic
solvents, there are no neutral molecules in ionic liquids, which are
composed of anions and cations with almost the same radius. Ionic
liquids thus have better thermal stability and electrical conductivity
than conventional solvents and have a number of advantages for carrying
out chemical reactions. These include faster reaction rates, high
selectivity and conversion rates of reactions, and recyclability of
the catalytic systems.

Alkali lignin is one of the large amounts
of byproducts of the
pulp and paper industry.4−7 If not handled properly, it will not only cause a
wastage of resources but also pollute the environment. To expand the
application of alkali lignin and increase its added value, the common
method is catalytic degradation. In the present study, [BMIM]Cl was
used alone to catalyze the degradation of lignin and, additionally,
{[BMIM]Cl + H3PW12O40/ZrO2} was used to optimize the experimental conditions for the degradation
of lignin. The effects of time, temperature, and lignin concentration
on the degradation reaction catalyzed by the ionic liquid alone were
analyzed. The effects of reaction time, temperature, and loading of
H3PW12O40/ZrO2 on the
degradation reaction were then investigated during the degradation
of lignin using the double-effect catalyst. The chemical structure
of the lignin degradation products and the bond-breaking method were
investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The free-radical-scavenging activity and reducing
power of the lignin degradation products were analyzed using diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazone
(DPPH) and hydroxyl free radicals. The degradation product produced
using the double-effect catalyst was found to have better free-radical
scavenging and antioxidant activities.

Results and Discussion
Optimization
of Reaction Conditions for the Catalytic Degradation
of Alkali Lignin by Ionic Liquids
The molar mass concentrations
of degradation products at different temperatures and times are shown
in Figure 3. The total
amount of hydroxyl groups reached a maximum of 10.92 mmol/g at 3 h
and 140 °C (Figure 3a). This is mainly because when the reaction time is short and the
temperature is low, the β–O-4 bonds in lignin are broken
down and hydroxyl groups are formed. When the temperature rises and
the reaction time increases, some of the newly generated hydroxyl
groups decompose or polymerize with other compounds under the continuous
high-temperature conditions, resulting in a significant decrease in
the molar concentration of hydroxyl groups.8−10 The amount
of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the degradation products showed a gradual
increase with increasing time and temperature, reaching a maximum
of 4.12 mmol/g at 140 °C for 12 h (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 Effects of reaction time on the content of total
hydroxyl groups
(a) and phenolic hydroxyl groups (b) in degradation products.

The molecular masses of lignin degradation products
formed with
different reaction times and temperatures are shown in Table 1. When the reaction temperature
was lower than 120 °C, the molecular weight of the degradation
product gradually decreased with the prolongation of reaction time.
When the reaction temperature was higher than 120 °C, the molecular
weight of the degradation product first decreased and then slowly
increased; the higher the temperature, the higher the rate of increase.
The molecular weight of the degradation product was the smallest with
a reaction time of 3 h and a temperature of 140 °C. Taking into
account the trend for a reduced total hydroxyl content with prolonged
reaction times at higher temperatures, it was concluded that a reaction
temperature of 140 °C and a degradation time of 3 h are the best
conditions for the catalytic degradation of alkali lignin using [BMIM]Cl.

In addition to the effects of the reaction temperature and time
on the degradation of lignin, the substrate concentration also plays
a role in determining the outcome of the reaction. The hydroxyl content
after reaction at different lignin substrate concentrations, using
the optimized reaction time of 3 h and temperature of 140 °C,
is shown in Table 2. Both total hydroxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups reached
a maximum when the concentration of the substrate was 2.5%. At higher
substrate concentrations, the hydroxyl content decreased, and so 2.5%
was chosen as the best substrate concentration.

Degradation of Alkali Lignin Using the Double-Effect
Catalyst
{H3PW12O40/ZrO2 + [BMIM]Cl}
Analysis
of Degradation Conditions
The distribution
of phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups in the alkali lignin degradation
products at different times and temperatures is shown in Figure 4. Both aliphatic
and phenolic hydroxyl groups reached a maximum at 2 h and 100 °C
at 8.52 and 6.69 mmol/g, respectively. At the beginning of the reaction,
when the temperature is low, some of the carboxyl groups in the lignin
are reduced, or C–O bonds are broken, and new hydroxyl groups
are generated. With a prolonged reaction time and increasing temperature,
however, the amount of hydroxyl groups in the degradation product
is greatly reduced because some of the newly generated hydroxyl groups
are decomposed or polymerize with other compounds at higher temperatures.4,11

Figure 4 Effect
of reaction time on the content of phenolic hydroxyl groups
(a) and the content of alcoholic hydroxyl groups (b) in alkali lignin
degradation products.

Gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) was used to determine the molecular
weight of the lignin degradation products. Before analysis, both the
alkali lignin raw material and the degraded solid product were acetylated
to improve the solubility and reduce association and aggregation.
The molecular mass of the lignin degradation products showed a trend
of first decreasing and then increasing with increasing temperature
and time (Figures 5 and 6). This is because two major reactions,
depolymerization and condensation, compete during the degradation
of lignin.9 In the depolymerization reaction,
β–O-4 bonds are broken, generating α-carbon cations
in the lignin structure. The formation of these α-carbon cations,
however, promotes the condensation reaction. This means that competition
between the cleavage of the β–O-4 bond and condensation
at the α-position results in changes in the relative molecular
mass of the degradation products throughout the reaction. The relative
molecular mass decreased from 10 600 to 3853 g/mol after 2
h at 100 °C and then gradually increased. Taking into account
the effects of reaction time and temperature on the hydroxyl content,
it was concluded that the optimal reaction temperature and time for
the degradation of alkali lignin are 100 °C and 2 h, respectively.

weight distribution of alkali lignin (a) and degraded
alkali lignin (b) (degradation conditions: 2 h at 100 °C).

Figure 6 Weight-average molecular weight of alkali lignin degradation
products
at different reaction times and temperatures.

The relationship between total hydroxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl
groups in the product after the degradation of alkali lignin catalyzed
by different mass fractions of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 is shown in Table 3. Both total hydroxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl
groups first increased and then decreased with increasing amounts
of the catalyst. The hydroxyl content reached a maximum value when
the ratio of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 to lignin was 1:4. When the amount of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 is too small, not all of the active
sites of lignin participate in the reaction, resulting in fewer hydroxyl
groups. When the amount of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 exceeds a certain level, however, besides increasing
the reaction rate, the increased surface area of the catalyst also
promotes the oxidation of the newly generated hydroxyl groups. The
hydroxyl content thus decreases as the ratio of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 to lignin increases beyond
1:4 and the degradation reaction deteriorates.

Analysis of the Chemical
Structure of Degradation Products
The infrared spectra of
alkali lignin before and after degradation
are very similar (Figure 7). The strength of the broad absorption peak around 3400 cm–1, which is attributed to the stretching vibration
of O–H groups, increased after degradation and activation.
The band at 2840 cm–1 is due to the C–H stretching
vibration of −OCH3 groups,12,13 the bands at 1600 and 1528 cm–1 are due to benzene
ring skeleton vibrations, and the bands at 1500 and 1368 cm–1 are due to saturated C–H bending vibrations. The benzene
ring structures were found before and after comparison, indicating
that it mainly occurred on the side chain and the reactive functional
groups on the benzene ring. Comparing the infrared spectra before
and after degradation, a new peak appeared at 1718 cm–1, which was attributed to a stretching vibration of C=O groups.

spectra of lignin (A), [BMIM]Cl degradation products (B),
and H3PW12O40/ZrO2 + [BMIM]Cl
dual-effect degradation products (C).

13C-NMR spectroscopy was used to further characterize
the structural changes that occurred on the degradation of alkali
lignin. The 13C-NMR spectra of alkali lignin (A) and the
degradation product after dual-action catalytic degradation by [BMIM]Cl
+ H3PW12O40/ZrO2 (B) are
shown in Figure 8.
Assignments of individual peaks in the 13C-NMR spectra
are provided in Table 4(14−16) After degradation, peaks attributed to −COOH groups in the
fatty acids of alkali lignin disappeared and it can be inferred that
a decarboxylation reaction occurred during degradation. The spectrum
of the degradation product also lacked the characteristic peak at
153.08 ppm for the S-type β–O-4 bond, indicating that
fragmentation had occurred during the degradation reaction. The spectra
both before and after degradation show peaks at 148.32–149.28
ppm that are characteristic of a G-type structural unit, indicating
that G-type β–O-4 bonds are not cleaved during degradation.
Dual-action catalytic degradation by [BMIM]Cl + H3PW12O40/ZrO2 thus generates mainly S-type
structures.

Antioxidant
Performance of Products of the Dual-Action Catalytic
Degradation
DPPH is a stable synthetic nitrogen-containing
free radical with a lone pair of electrons. A solution of DPPH in
methanol or ethanol is purple, with a maximum absorption peak at 517
nm. In the presence of free-radical scavengers, the lone pairs of
electrons in DPPH are paired, and the purple color of the radical •DPPH fades and is replaced by the yellow
color of the reduced nonradical form, DPPH-H. The amount of electrons
donated by a free-radical scavenger can be quantified by the degree
of fading of the purple color of a DPPH solution, allowing quantitative
analysis of the antioxidant capacity of lignin by measuring changes
in the absorbance of a solution of DPPH.17,18 Line graphs of the DPPH free-radical-scavenging capacity of alkali
lignin as a function of the mass concentration before and after degradation
are compared with those of the commercial antioxidant 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol
(BHT) in Figure 9.
As the mass concentration increases, the capacity of degraded alkali
lignin to remove •DPPH gradually increases.
The antioxidant capacity of degraded alkali lignin is close to that
of BHT at the same mass concentration and is significantly higher
than that of untreated alkali lignin. Once the concentration of degraded
alkali lignin reached 0.6 g/L, the curve gradually flattened and the
clearance rate was 80%. The degradation of alkali lignin thus increases
its free-radical-scavenging capacity.

Figure 9 Clearance rates of DPPH free radicals
by wheat straw alkali lignin
before and after degradation compared with the clearance by BHT.

The capacity of wheat straw alkali lignin, before
and after degradation,
to scavenge hydroxyl radicals (•OH)
is compared with that of BHT in Figure 10. •OH radicals
are formed from OH– by the loss of one electron
and are highly active oxidizing agents. o-Phenanthroline
reacts with ferrous ions to form an iron-o-phenanthroline
complex, which is commonly used as a redox indicator. The complex
has a maximum absorption at a wavelength of 536 nm, and when the ferrous
iron-o-phenanthroline is oxidized by •OH to a ferric iron-o-phenanthroline complex,
the absorbance at 536 nm is reduced. In the presence of •OH radical scavengers, oxidation of the ferrous
complex is reduced and absorbance at 536 nm is relatively unchanged.
When this system was used to measure the •OH-scavenging activity of alkali lignin and degraded alkali
lignin, the scavenging activity was shown to increase as the mass
concentration increased until the lignin concentration reached 0.6
g/L, when the scavenging activity increased more slowly (Figure 10). Degraded alkali
lignin has a slightly greater •OH-scavenging
ability than untreated alkali lignin, but its activity is much lower
than that of the positive control BHT.

Figure 10 •OH
radical-scavenging activity of wheat straw
alkali lignin, before and after degradation, compared with the activity
of BHT.

An analysis of the reducing capacity
of alkali lignin is shown
in Figure 11. The
reducing capacity of antioxidants reflects their antioxidant activity;
the stronger the reducing power, the stronger the antioxidant effect.
The magnitude of the reducing capacity thus reflects the magnitude
of the antioxidant effect. In this experiment, the ability of the
antioxidants to reduce ferric ions to ferrous ions was determined.
The reducing capacity of alkali lignin before and after degradation
increased with increasing mass concentration but was less than that
of the positive control BHT. The reducing power of the alkali lignin
degradation product was, however, markedly higher than that of the
raw material at the same mass concentration.

Figure 11 Reducing capacity of
wheat straw lignin before and after degradation
compared with that of BHT.

Conclusions
Based on the hydroxyl content and molecular
weight of the products,
the optimal reaction time for the degradation of alkali lignin by
the ionic liquid [BMIM]Cl was 3 h, the optimal reaction temperature
was 140 °C, and the optimal substrate concentration was 2.5%.
When H3PW12O40/ZrO2 was
used in the mass ratio of 1:4, the optimal reaction time for degradation
was shortened to 2 h and the optimal reaction temperature was reduced
to 100 °C. In the presence of H3PW12O40/ZrO2, the total hydroxyl content in the degradation
product increased by 123.4% compared with the ionic liquid alone and
the relative molecular weight of the product was reduced by 3853 g/mol.

FT-IR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy were used to characterize
the structures of the alkali lignin degradation products and to determine
the bond-breaking mechanisms. The main bond-breaking mechanism was
found to be rupture of the β–O-4 bond. The degradation
product obtained by catalysis with {H3PW12O40/ZrO2 + [BMIM]Cl} showed good antioxidant properties
and this degradation method thus provides a promising route for the
future development of new applications for lignin.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of H3PW12O40/ZrO2 and Alkali Lignin
Preparation of H3PW12O40/ZrO2
A 10 M ammonia solution was
added dropwise with
stirring to a 0.2 M solution of zirconium chloride until the pH of
the solution was 8. The precipitate was collected by filtration and
washed with aqueous ammonia (pH = 8) until no chloride ions were detected
by a silver nitrate test. The solid was dried at 120 °C for 12
h, and the resulting zirconia was ground to provide a 400 mesh powder.
H3PW12O40 (1 g) was dissolved in
absolute ethanol (16 mL), and zirconia (4 g) was added. The mixture
was refluxed at 80 °C for 12 h, and excess ethanol was removed
by rotary vacuum evaporation at 39 °C. The resulting solid was
dried at 120 °C for 24 h and then activated by heating in a muffle
furnace at 200 °C for 4 h.

Alkali Lignin Pretreatment
Crude alkali lignin was
stirred with distilled water (1:9 lignin/distilled water) to rapidly
dissolve the lignin. After standing for 12–24 h, insoluble
impurities were removed by suction filtration. Aqueous hydrochloric
acid (2 M) was then slowly added to the filtrate until the pH of the
filtrate was 2. After standing for 12–24 h, the precipitate
was removed by suction filtration and the filter cake was washed with
water until the washings were neutral. The resulting refined alkali
lignin was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h and ground to
provide a 400 mesh powder.19

Catalytic
Degradation of Alkali Lignin by [BMIM]Cl
[BMIM]Cl was heated
to 80 °C with stirring in a 250 mL beaker
until the solid had melted. Wheat straw lignin was added and the mixture
was stirred rapidly until the lignin had completely dissolved. An
aliquot (30 mL) of the solution was transferred to a 50 mL reaction
kettle and heated under vacuum for several hours. The reaction kettle
was then cooled to room temperature and the contents were transferred
to a beaker. Distilled water (600 mL, Vionic liquid/Vdistilled water = 1:20) was added
and the resulting flocculent precipitate was separated by filtration
through a membrane filter. The solid product was dried under vacuum
at 45 °C for 24 h and the filtrate was collected.

Double-Effect
Catalytic Degradation of Alkali Lignin by {H3PW12O40/ZrO2 + [BMIM]Cl}
[BMIM]Cl was
heated to 80 °C with stirring in a 250 mL beaker
until the solid had melted. Wheat straw lignin was added to the ionic
liquid and the mixture was stirred at 400 rpm for 2 h to completely
dissolve the lignin. An aliquot (30 mL) of the above solution was
transferred to a 50 mL microreactor and the H3PW12O40/ZrO2 catalyst was added. The mixture was
heated to X °C in a vacuum drying oven and,
after Y h, was cooled to room temperature and filtered
to recover H3PW12O40/ZrO2. The H3PW12O40/ZrO2 was
washed with distilled water until no [BMIM]Cl residue remained and
then dried for 6 h, calcined, and activated. Distilled water was added
to the filtrate (Vionic liquid/Vdistilled water = 1:20) and the mixture
was allowed to stand for 1 h. The precipitated solid lignin product
was collected and dried under vacuum at 45 °C for 24 h. An aliquot
(10 mL) of the filtrate was also collected.

Characterization of Alkali
Lignin
Determination of Hydroxyl Groups
The molar mass of
total hydroxyl groups in the lignin was determined using the acetylation–hydrolysis
method,20,21 and the molar concentration of phenolic
hydroxyl groups was determined using differential photometry.22,23 The aliphatic hydroxyl content was calculated as follows: total
hydroxyl content—phenolic hydroxyl content.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
Infrared spectroscopic analysis
of lignin and its degradation products was performed using an FT-IR-650
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer over the range of 400–4000
cm–1 at a resolution of 4 cm–1 with 64 scans.

Determination of the Molecular Weight of
Lignin
Gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) was carried out using an Agilent Series
1100 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to determine
the molecular weight of the lignin. The lignin was acetylated using
the following procedure: Lignin (0.08 g) was dissolved in the acetylation
reagent (1.50 g) and the solution was heated to 50 °C in a water
bath for 24–48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solution
was washed with ether to remove excess acetylating reagent. The solid
product was removed by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven at
40 °C for 24 h.24 Acetylated lignin
(20 mg) was added to tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) and the insoluble matter
was removed by filtration through a 0.45 μm filter. GPC was
carried out using 79911GP-101 and 79911GP-104 (Tianjin Gangdong Technology
Co., Ltd.) columns connected in series. The mobile phase was tetrahydrofuran,
the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, the column temperature was 25 °C,
and the injection volume was 50 μL.

13C-NMR Spectroscopy
13C-NMR
spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 M superconducting nuclear
magnetic resonance instrument (Bruker, Germany). Lignin (100 mg) was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (0.6 mL), and spectra were
recorded using a 30 pulse sequence, a sampling time of 1.36 s, a relaxation
time of 1.89 s, and 30 000 accumulations. MestReNova software
(Mestrelab Research SL) was used for subsequent data processing.

Antioxidant Properties of Alkali Lignin
1-Diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazone
(DPPH) Radical-Scavenging
Ability
DPPH (4 mg) was dissolved in absolute ethanol and
diluted to 100 mL in a volumetric flask. The solution was stored at
0–4 °C in the dark before use. Sample solutions (1 mL;
0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 g/L) were shaken well with
the DPPH solution (4 mL) and placed in the dark for 30 min. Absolute
ethanol was used as the blank and its absorbance was measured at 517
nm. 2,6-Ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), which is commonly used
as an antioxidant in food processing, was used as the positive control.
The clearance rate was calculated by eq 1 1  where A0 is the
absorbance of the DPPH solution in anhydrous ethanol and A1 is the absorbance of the test solution.

Hydroxyl
Radical (•OH)-Scavenging Ability
A phenanthroline
solution (5 mM, 0.3 mL) was placed in a ground-glass
tube, and pH 7.45 phosphate-buffered solution (0.8 mL) and deionized
water (0.25 mL) were added sequentially. The mixture was shaken well;
FeSO4 solution (7.5 mM, 0.3 mL) was added and the solution
was mixed immediately. The sample solution (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,
0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 g/L) was added to the test tube, followed by 1%
H2O2 solution (0.2 mL). After incubation at
37 °C for 60 min, the absorbance was measured at 536 nm. BHT
was used as the positive control. The clearance rate was calculated
by eq 2 2  where Asample is
the absorbance of the lignin sample (Fe2+ + phenanthroline
+ H2O2 + lignin), Adamage is the absorbance of damaged tube (Fe2+ + phenanthroline
+ H2O2), Acontrast is the absorbance of the control tube (Fe2+ +phenanthroline),
and Ablank is the absorbance of the blank
(Fe2++ phenanthroline + lignin).

Measurement of Reducing
Power
The sample solution (0.025,
0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 g/L) was placed in a test tube and
treated with pH 6.6 phosphate-buffered saline (2.5 mL) and 1% potassium
ferricyanide solution. After shaking and mixing, the reaction mixture
was stored at 50 °C for 20 min. Trichloroacetic acid solution
(2.5 mL) was then added and the mixture was shaken. An aliquot (2.5
mL) of the supernatant was treated with deionized water (2.5 mL) and
0.1% FeCl3 (0.5 mL) solution, and the absorbance was measured
at 700 nm.
