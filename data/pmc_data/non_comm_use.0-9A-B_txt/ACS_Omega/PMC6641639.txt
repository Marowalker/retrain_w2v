Light wavelength identification is
essential for many optical and optoelectronic applications.
Here, we report a novel wavelength identification photodetector based
on the energy distribution of hot electrons at the metal/insulator
interface. The information of the light wavelength can be stored in
the energy distribution of the hot electrons, which can then be readout
in the form of the current–voltage characteristics. On the
basis of this principle, the high-reliability wavelength identification
of the monochromatic light has been realized with a simple Al/SiO2/Si structure. The device has an excellent stability with
dark current below 1 × 10–7 A/m2. Moreover, the wavelength of the monochromatic light in the deep
ultraviolet range can be identified. This new principle will pave
a new solution to design high-performance single-chip wavelength identification
photodetectors and integrated miniaturized wavelength identification
systems.

Introduction
Light wavelength identification
is critical for a wide range of
applications, such as intelligent color recognition,1,2 automatic sorting system, tunable diode lasers,3 missile threat warning,4 or
optical interconnects and plasmonic nanocircuits.5,6 Because
of limitations of the carrier transport mechanism, conventional semiconductor
photodetectors do not have the capability to identify light wavelength.
To achieve wavelength identification, they need the aid of many kinds
of auxiliary components, including grating,7,8 filter,9 macrobending single-mode fiber,10 distributed Bragg reflector,11 and resonant cavity.12

Recently,
hot-electron photodetectors have been demonstrated to
directly identify the wavelength of monochromatic light with a simple
metal/insulator/metal (MIM) structure,13,14 which significantly
reduces the cost and complication of the system and can be compatible
with high-compact photonic integration. In these MIM junctions, the
hot electrons photoexcited in the top metal layer could emit into
the bottom metal layer over the conduction band of the middle insulation
layer, inducing a detectable open circuit voltage (Voc). In the case that the hot electrons are not scattered
in the insulation layer, the Voc can correspond
one-to-one to the wavelength of the monochromatic light.13 On the basis of this principle, wavelength identification
of monochromatic light in the infrared and visible range has been
realized. However, the thickness of the middle insulation layer in
these photodetectors must be ultrathin, typically less than 10 nm,13,15−17 to make sure that the hot electrons pass through
the insulation layer without scattering and energy loss. Such an ultrathin
insulation layer would cause an intolerable leakage current, leading
to device instability in practical applications.18 In addition, because the mean free path of the excited
hot electrons in the ultraviolet range is much shorter than that in
the visible or infrared range,15,19,20 the hot electrons may suffer strong scattering in the insulation
layer as the wavelength decreases to the ultraviolet range, which
will restrict the wavelength identification to be further extended
to the ultraviolet or even shorter region.

Here, we report on
a novel wavelength identification photodetector
based on the energy distribution of the hot electrons at the metal/insulator
interface. Monochromatic light with a particular wavelength can excite
its unique energy distribution of the hot electrons and lead to a
corresponding unique current–voltage (I–V) characteristic. This wavelength identification is determined
by the properties of the hot electrons just located at the metal/insulator
interface and less restricted by transport behaviors (such as hot-electron
scattering) in the insulation layer. Thus, the thickness of the insulator
can be up to several tens of nanometers, which is about 1 order of
magnitude larger than that of the mean free path, making for an excellent
device performance and a very low dark current (∼1 × 10–7 A/m2). Meanwhile, the photodetector has
the capability to identify deep ultraviolet monochromatic light with
a resolution of ∼1 nm. To our knowledge, this is the first
report in which electrons’ energy distribution can be effectively
used to identify the light wavelength. Furthermore, this is the first
photodetector that has wavelength identification capability in the
ultraviolet range. Our finding will pave a new solution to design
high-performance single-chip wavelength detectors and integrated miniaturized
wavelength identification systems.

Results and Discussion
A silicon-technology-compatible Al/SiO2/Si structure
was fabricated to explore wavelength identification based on the energy
distribution of hot electrons. The schematic diagram and the cross-sectional
scanning electron microcopy (SEM) images are shown in Figure 1a. A 40 nm thick SiO2 was formed on the bottom p-type Si substrate by thermal oxidation,
followed by an electron-beam evaporation of a 15 nm-thick Al layer,
with an area of 1 mm2 as the hot-electron emission layer,
chosen for the relatively low Al/SiO2 interface barrier
height (3.2 eV)21 to get a wide ultraviolet
wavelength detection range. Ti/Au layers were then evaporated onto
the Si substrate and Al layer for the positive and negative ohmic
electrodes, respectively.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram and cross-sectional SEM
images of the Al/SiO2/Si structure. (b) The I–V curves of the hot-electron photodetector
with a 40 nm SiO2 insulation layer under illumination conditions
of 290 nm with 60
μW light power and dark, the dark current is also shown in the
inset.

When monochromatic light (e.g.,
290 nm 60 μW ultraviolet
light) is illuminated on the Al/SiO2/Si junction form above,
photocurrent is generated due to the hot-electron internal photoemission
process, as shown in Figure 1b. Under positive bias, the hot electrons photoexcited in
the Al layer will cross the Al/SiO2 interface barrier to
form a forward photocurrent of 2 × 10–9 A at
4 V, corresponding to a responsivity beyond 3 × 10–5 A/W; under negative bias, the hot electrons photoexcited in the
Si substrate will cross the Si/SiO2 interface barrier,
contributing a reverse photocurrent. In this Al/SiO2/Si
junction, the forward photocurrent is much greater than the reverse
one, which is due to the lower interface electron barrier (3.2 eV
for Al/SiO2, 4.2 eV for p-Si/SiO2) and higher
light absorptivity of aluminum than those of the bottom silicon. It
needs to be noted that hot holes can also be generated when the device
is illuminated; however, because of the considerably high interface
holes barrier (5.8 eV for Al/SiO2, 4.8 eV for p-Si/SiO2), the photocurrent induced by hot holes could be neglected.
Without the illumination, the dark current of this wavelength detector
is below 1 × 10–13 A (corresponding to current
density of 1 × 10–7 A/m2) over the
entire applied voltage range, which even reaches the noise level of
the test system. This ultralow dark current is attributed to the high-quality
thick SiO2 insulation layer, which is 1 order of magnitude
higher than that of previously reported hot-electron photodetectors,13,16,17,22 making for an excellent device stability in practical applications.
The signal-to-noise ratio
of the Al/SiO2(40 nm)/Si junction at +4 V can be estimated
to be larger than 2 × 104 by calculating the ratio
of photocurrent and dark current (here, the noise level of the test
system is regarded as the maximum possible dark current). It needs
to be noted that only the photocurrent can be precisely measured in
a wide range of insulator thicknesses (see the Supporting Information S1). The dark current is so small that
it is beyond the accuracy of the test system. Therefore, we took the
accuracy value of the test system as the noise level of the device,
and an underestimated signal-to-noise ratio was obtained. According
to the Poole–Frenkel tunneling model, the dark current of the
Al/SiO2(40 nm)/Si junction can be theoretically predicted
to be lower than 5 × 10–15 A (see the Supporting Information S2). In the future, the
higher-accuracy test system with lower noise should be developed to
precisely measure the dark current and signal-to-noise ratio of these
wavelength detectors.

By changing the wavelength of the incident
monochromatic light,
the Al/SiO2/Si junction exhibits a very sensitive wavelength-dependent
characteristic, as shown in Figure 2a. With the wavelength increasing from 260 to 360 nm,
the normalized I–V curves
gradually transform from a convex to a concave curve. Each wavelength
corresponds to its unique normalized I–V curve. Therefore, wavelength identification can be achieved
by distinguishing the shape of the normalized I–V curves, with a limiting wavelength-identification resolution
of about 1 nm (see the Supporting Information S3). The resolution of this kind of device may be determined
by thermal fluctuation of room-temperature electrons near the Fermi
level (with an energy of kBT), which disturbs the energy distribution of the hot electrons in
the initial stage of the hot electrons generation. A higher resolution
(approaching or exceeding the modern optical spectrum analyzers of
0.1 nm) can be achieved when the device operates at a lower temperature.
In addition, this wavelength identification is power-independent.
With the illuminated light power increasing from 1 to 60 μW,
the photocurrent increases linearly (see the Supporting Information S4), but the normalized I–V curves overlap with each other in this power range, as
shown in Figure 2a.
These power-independent properties will facilitate the practical application
without considering the variable received light intensity.

Figure 2 (a) Normalized I–V curves
over a wavelength range of 260–360 nm. With the incident wavelength
increasing, the I–V curves
gradually change from the convex to the concave curve. Normalized I–V curves under illumination at
290 and 320 nm with different powers. When the illuminated light intensity
is changed from 1 to 60 μW, the normalized I–V curves overlap with each other in this
power range. (b) The ratio of current at any voltage to the current
at 4 V for light wavelength from 260 to 360 nm, Ix/I4, where Ix and I4 are the photocurrents at voltages of x and
4 V, respectively. (c) A practical wavelength identification setup.
(d) The input voltage and output current signal under illumination
wavelengths of 290, 320, and 350 nm. (e) The measured I2/I4 values at 290, 320, and
350 nm, which are precisely consistent with the current ratios obtained
from the normalized I–V curves.

Although the normalized I–V curves can be used to identify
the wavelength of the incident light,
in practical application, it is not needed to measure the full I–V curves. The current ratio at
any two voltages can already determine the corresponding I–V curve and the incident light wavelength. Figure 2b shows the ratio
of current at any voltage to the current at 4 V for light wavelengths
from 260 to 360 nm, Ix/I4, where Ix and I4 are the photocurrent
at voltage of x and 4 V, respectively. Ix/I4 decreases
monotonically with the wavelength increasing. Taking I2/I4 as an example, with the
wavelength increasing from 260 to 360 nm, I2/I4 decreases monotonically from 0.5
to 0.06. In addition, similar to the case of the normalized I–V curves, the current ratio is
also power-independent (see the Supporting Information S5). Therefore, a monochromatic light wavelength can be simply
identified by using the Ix/I4 value. It needs to be noted that
the denominator of the current ratio is not limited to be 4 V, any
other voltage can also serve as the standard (see the Supporting Information S6).

Figure 2c illustrates
the practical setup for light wavelength identification. A square
wave signal is applied to the electrodes of the hot-electron device,
with the high and low levels to be 4 and 2 V, respectively. When an
unknown monochromatic light is illuminated on the top Al layer of
the device, by reading the output photocurrent and calculating the
current ratio, the incident wavelength can be identified. Figure 2d shows the input
square wave signal and the output photocurrent at wavelengths of 290,
320, and 350 nm, respectively. The cycle of the input square wave
signal is chosen to be 30 s by considering the relatively slow device
response time of about 100 ms (see the Supporting Information S7). The output photocurrent and the current ratio I2/I4 are substantially
constant during each cycle. The mean values of I2/I4 are 0.37, 0.24, and 0.08,
respectively, for these three wavelengths, as shown in Figure 2e. On the basis of the relationship
between wavelength and Ix/I4 in Figure 2b, the wavelengths can be identified to be
290, 320, and 350 nm respectively, which agree well with the actual
wavelengths. Therefore, using this test system, monochromatic light
wavelengths can be easily identified by the input and output alternating
current square wave signal.

Even for a wide range of SiO2 thicknesses, the photodetectors
still show an excellent wavelength identification capability, as shown
in Figure 3. At a thickness
of 5 nm, the I–V curves show
a crescent-like shape and turn on at zero electric field. This zero
turn-on electric field may be attributed to the tunneling or defect-assisted
leakage current, which usually influences the performance of optoelectronic
devices with a thin dielectric layer.23 With the thickness increasing from 5 to 20 nm, the shape of the I–V curves gradually transforms
to an olive-like shape. As the thickness further increases to 60 nm,
the shape of I–V curves becomes
almost unchanged. This trend indicates that our wavelength identification
principle is dominated by the properties of electron energy distribution
just near the Al/SiO2 interface and less influenced by
the transport behavior (such as scattering) in the whole SiO2 layer. In addition, the open circuit voltage is always zero, even
for the thickness down to 5 nm. This is because the hot-electron scattering
in insulator is very strong and they cannot pass through the SiO2 layer in the absence of the applied voltage, suggesting that
it is difficult to identify the wavelength on the basis of the previously
reported principle by just reading out the open circuit voltage when
the wavelength is too short.13

Figure 3 Normalized I–V curves
of the hot-electron devices with SiO2 thicknesses of 5,
10, 20, 40, and 60 nm under different light wavelengths. The electric
field is calculated by V/d, where V and d are the applied voltage and SiO2 thickness, respectively.

Figure 4 shows
the
energy diagram of the metal/insulator interface under illumination
with different wavelengths, which can help to illustrate how the wavelength
can be identified by using the hot-electron energy distribution. When
the metal is photoexcited, the hot electrons with energy distribution N(E, ℏω) will be generated
in a wide range from Ef to Ef + ℏω,24 where Ef is Fermi energy and ℏω is incident
photon energy. Note that the hot electrons would be thermalized before
they reach the Al/SiO2 interface because the mean free
path of the hot electrons excited by ultraviolet light is about 2
nm,15 which is far less than the thickness
of the Al layer; the hot electrons will redistribute their energy
with other lower energy electrons before they reach the Al/SiO2 interface; then, a high-effective-temperature Fermi–Dirac
electron distribution is formed. When a negative voltage is applied
to the metal layer, the hot electrons that have energies higher than
that of the metal/insulator interface barrier Φ(V) may emit into the conduction band of the insulator, contributing
to a detectable photocurrent Ia. With
the applied negative voltage decreasing, Φ(V) decreases at a rate proportional to the square root of the applied
voltage due to the image force lowering effect,25 causing more hot electrons to emit into the conduction
band of the insulator and an improved photocurrent Ib. For different wavelengths of the incident light, the
current ratio Ia/Ib is different, as shown in Figure 4a–c. With the wavelength increasing,
the upper limit of the N(E, ℏω)
moves closer to the interface barrier and the initial photocurrent
becomes smaller, leading to a decreased Ia/Ib, which agrees with the experimental
trends of the current ratios shown in Figure 2b. This means that the longer wavelength
could excite the smaller Ia/Ib and the steeper current increases with voltage increasing.
Thus, wavelength identification can be realized by distinguishing
the current ratio or I–V characteristics
of devices with the metal/insulator interface.

Figure 4 Energy diagram of the
metal/insulator interface under illumination
with different wavelengths, which corresponds to the photon energy
of (a) ℏω1, (b) ℏω2, and (c) ℏω3, respectively. Monochromatic
light excites electrons, with energy distribution N(E, ℏω) corresponding to its wavelength,
the hot electrons with energy higher than the metal/insulator barrier
Φ(V) may eject into the conduction band of
the SiO2 layer and produce current Ia. With the applied negative voltage decreasing, Φ(V) decreases from Φ(Va) to Φ(Vb), causing an increased
photocurrent Ib. When the illuminated
wavelength increases, the current ratio Ia/Ib decreases; this characteristic can
be used to identify the wavelength of the monochromatic light.

On the basis of this principle,
the wavelength identification is
determined by the properties of the hot electrons just located at
the metal/insulator interface and less restricted by the transport
behaviors (such as hot electrons scattering) in the insulation layer.
Thus, a wavelength identification photodetector with a thick middle
insulation layer that permits excellent device stability has been
successfully realized. In addition, arbitrary wavelengths, such as
visible or infrared, can also be easily identified by choosing the
suitable metal/insulator barrier height with proper work functions.

Conclusions
We report a novel wavelength identification photodetector based
on the energy distribution of hot electrons at the metal/insulator
interface, which established the unique and power-independent relationship
between wavelength of monochromatic light and I–V characteristics. A deep ultraviolet wavelength identification
ranging from 260 to 360 nm has been successfully demonstrated. Meanwhile,
the thickness of the middle insulation layer can be up to several
tens of nanometers, resulting in an excellent device stability and
a very low dark current. In addition, we study the influence of the
insulator thickness on the I–V curves of Al/SiO2/Si junctions, confirming that our wavelength
identification is determined by the hot electrons just located at
the metal/insulator interface and not limited by the thickness of
the insulation layer. Our findings could pave a way for designing
the single-chip wavelength identification, with a wide detection range
and an excellent reliability simultaneously.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
Al/SiO2/Si devices were
fabricated on p-type (100) silicon substrates (doping density: 1–5
× 1019 cm–3, resistivity: 2–8
× 10–3 Ω cm). The substrates were cleaned
by the standard silicon cleaning recipe. SiO2 was formed
on p-Si substrates by thermal oxidation in oxygen atmosphere at 950
°C, the thickness was controlled by thermal oxidation time, and
SiO2 layers with thicknesses of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm
were formed on p-Si, respectively. Fifteen nanometers of Al layers
were deposited onto the SiO2-coated substrates using electron-beam
evaporation with a shadow mask. Then, a layer of Ti/Au was deposited
on the substrates in the selected region where the thermal-oxidized
SiO2 has been removed by buffered oxide etch and the p-Si
could directly come in contact with Ti/Au to form bottom electrodes.
On the other hand, another Ti/Au layer was directly deposited on the
Al layer to form upper electrodes using a shadow mask. Finally, the
devices were wire-bonded to a chip carrier for electrical and optical
measurement.

Experimental Setup
Current–voltage
characteristics
were measured using an Agilent B1500A. A xenon lamp provided illumination
from 260 to 1100 nm, and a monochromatic light was achieved when the
white light passed through a monochromator. The light spot on the
devices was controlled by adjusting the lens on the optical path.
