Molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) quantum dots (QDs) derived
from this two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide are
emerging zero-dimensional materials that possess very good optical
properties. Bioimaging using light in the biological II window (950–1350
nm) is a next-generation approach that will allow clinicians to achieve
deeper tissue imaging with better image contrast and reduced phototoxicity
and photobleaching. This article reports the development of a water-soluble,
zero-dimensional antibody-conjugated transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QD-based two-photon luminescence (TPL) probe for the
targeted bioimaging of cancer cells in the biological II window. The
data indicates that MoS2 QDs exhibit an extremely high
two-photon absorption cross-section (σ = 58960 GM) and two-photon
brightness (4.7 × 103 GM) because of the quantum confinement
and edge effects. Experimental data show that anti-PSMA antibody-attached
MoS2 QDs can be used for selective two-photon imaging of
live prostate cancer cells using 1064 nm light because of the high
two-photon brightness, very good photostability, and very good biocompatibility
of these MoS2 QDs. The data demonstrate that the bioconjugated
MoS2 QDs can distinguish targeted and nontargeted cells.
This study illuminates the high two-photon brightness mechanism of
MoS2 QDs and provides a zero-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenide-based selective TPL agent for high-efficiency live
cell imaging.

1 Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) transition
metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2, WSe2, and MoSe2 are
promising building blocks for use in next-generation optoelectronics
and photonics applications.1−5 The unsaturated d orbitals of Mo and W generate the band structures
that help these materials to exhibit interesting properties.7−12 The 2D dichalcogenide MoS2, a structural analogue of
2D graphene, has received tremendous attention in the semiconductor
industry because of its direct band gap of 1.8 eV in a monolayer and
the layer dependence of its band structure.6−12 Monolayer MoS2 exhibits strong photoluminescence due
to its indirect–direct band gap transition, and its luminescent
enhancement factor can be 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of
multilayer MoS2.3−12 However, the room-temperature photoluminescence quantum yield (QY)
is extremely low (Φ ∼ 0.01) for 2D MoS2, and
as a result, its application in two-photon imaging applications is
rare.10−18 To overcome this problem, we report the design of zero-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 quantum dots (QDs)
using a bottom-up hydrothermal method. These MoS2 QDs exhibit
extremely high two-photon absorption properties, with a two-photon
absorption (TPA) cross-section (σ) of 58 960 GM (Goeppert-Mayer
units, where 1 GM = 10–50 cm4 s photon–1), which is several orders of magnitude higher than
that of organic dyes and much higher than that of semiconductor QDs.19−32 The data indicate that their two-photon brightness (σ ×
Φ, where Φ is the two-photon fluorescence QY) is around
7.6 × 104 GM, which is very good for bright two-photon
luminescence (TPL) imaging. In our design, by decreasing the size
of MoS2 to between 3 and 5 nm, the quantum confinement
and edge effects have been enhanced tremendously.

Bioimaging
using two-photon near-infrared (NIR) light excitation
is very popular method for in vitro and in vivo imaging, offering
significant benefits over one-photon luminescence microscopy, including
a very high penetration depth and less photobleaching.19−27 For efficient, noninvasive biological diagnostic use, NIR light
in the second biological window (950–1350 nm) will provide
a deeper penetration depth into biological tissues, better image contrast,
and reduced phototoxicity and photobleaching.28−38 As a result, biological imaging using light in the NIR I and II
windows is a very good option to avoid absorption by physiological
fluids.20−30 Despite these advantages, due to the lack of biocompatible fluorescent
probes with very good imaging capability in the biological I and II
windows, fluorescence microscopy is not used routinely in the clinic.19−32 Two-photon fluorescence (TPF) imaging using NIR light in the biological
I and II windows has opened up the possibility of new discoveries
and breakthroughs in the biological sciences because it allows for
the investigation of complex biological samples.19−36 The efficiency of bioimaging using a TPF microscope is highly dependent
on the two-photon absorption cross-section and two-photon QY of the
fluorescence probe.24−36 However, commonly used organic two-photon fluorescence probes are
not photostable, and these dyes also exhibit a low two-photon absorption
cross-section (∼1–100 GM), which hampers the use of
TPF for real-life imaging.19−32

To facilitate the use of TPF imaging tools in the bioimaging
community,
we report the development of a water-soluble antibody-conjugated transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QD-based two-photon photoluminescence
probe for targeted bioimaging of LnCaP prostate cancer cells using
light in the biological I and II transparency windows, as shown in Figure 1A. For this purpose,
MoS2 QDs were modified with lipoic acid-terminated poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) to increase their stability in physiological solutions,
and an anti-PSMA antibody was attached to the MoS2 QDs
via PEG to allow their use in targeted imaging. The results shows
that due to their very high two-photon brightness, photostability,
and lower cytotoxicity, antibody-conjugated MoS2 QDs are
a very good candidate for TPF imaging of live cells in the NIR biological
I and II windows.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Development and Characterization of Zero-Dimensional
Bioconjugated MoS2 QDs
Zero-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs were synthesized using a
bottom-up hydrothermal method,12−16 as shown in Figure 1A. Details of the synthesis route are discussed
in Section 4.1. For
this purpose, Na2MoO4·2H2O was
used as the source of Mo and l-cysteine was used as a S precursor.
At the end, the purified particles were characterized by high-resolution
tunneling electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS),
as reported in Figure 1 and Table 1.

transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs. (B, C) Bright-field

data in the inset clearly show the presence of Mo and S. (E) HRTEM

is due to the (100) lattice of MoS2. (F) Raman spectra
showing two strong Raman bands. The first band is observed at 380.7
cm–1, which is due to the in-plane (E12g) vibration of the Mo–S bond in MoS2 QDs. The second band is observed at 406.5 cm–1, which is due to the vertical plane (A1g) vibration of
the Mo–S bond in MoS2 QDs. (G) X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) patterns of MoS2 QDs and bulk MoS2. The
XRD spectra show the (100) and (103) planes of the crystalline MoS2 phase in MoS2 QDs. (H) Histogram of the size distribution
of MoS2 QDs measured by DLS.

Figure 1D shows
a TEM image of freshly prepared transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs, which indicates that the size of the MoS2 QDs is 6 ± 2 nm. DLS data, reported in Figure 1H and Table 1, also indicate that the average size of transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs is about 7 ± 2 nm, which
matches the TEM data quite well. We also performed high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) to characterize the lattice structure of the transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs developed using a bottom-up
hydrothermal method. The HRTEM image in Figure 1E shows the crystalline lattice structure
of the MoS2 QDs with a fringe lattice spacing around 0.27
nm due to the (100) lattice plane. EDX elemental mapping, as shown
in the inset of Figure 1D, clearly indicates the presence of Mo and S. The crystal structure
of the MoS2 QDs was investigated using X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) and compared with that of bulk MoS2, as shown in Figure 1G. For MoS2 QDs, we observed intense diffraction peaks at 30.9 and 39°,
which can be assigned to the (100) and (103) planes of the crystalline
MoS2 phase. As shown in Figure 1G, the XRD diffraction signals for the (002)
and (105) planes totally disappeared for the MoS2 QDs,
which indicates the formation of few-layered MoS2 QDs.

We also performed Raman spectroscopy, which shows two strong Raman
bands for the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs.
As shown in Figure 1F, the first band is at 380.9 cm–1, which is due
to the in-plane (E12g) vibration of the Mo–S
bond in the MoS2 QDs.12−18 The second band is observed at 405.4 cm–1, which
is due to the vertical plane (A1g) vibration of the Mo–S
bond in the MoS2 QDs.12−18 The observed E12g and A1g vibrational
modes clearly indicate the presence of exfoliated MoS2 nanostructures
in the transition metal dichalcogenide QDs.12−18 The observed peak spacing for the MoS2 QDs is much lower
than that of bulk MoS2 (25.7 cm–1)12−18 reported in the literature, which indicates that MoS2 QDs contain a few-layered structure for MoS2.

Figure 1B,C shows
that a solution of the water-soluble MoS2 QDs emits blue
fluorescence upon irradiation with UV light. The excitation wavelength-dependent
single-photon photoluminescence spectra of the MoS2 QDs
at excitation wavelengths ranging from 300 to 532 nm, as reported
in Figure 2A, clearly
show strong blue photoluminescence under UV light excitation. To determine
the photoluminescence QY of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs, we used quinine sulfate as a standard, whose QY is well
documented (Φ = 54%). The QY for the transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs was determined using eq 1.8−20 1  where the
transition metal dichalcogenide
is denoted TMD, the quinine sulfate standard is denoted QS, Φ
is the quantum yield under 375 nm excitation, A is
the absorbance, I is the fluorescence intensity,
and η is the refractive index.

Figure 2 (A) Excitation wavelength-dependent single-photon
luminescence

transition metal dichalcogenide QDs can be tuned more than 250 nm
by varying just the excitation energy without changing their chemical
composition. (B) TPL intensity of the MoS2 QDs at 1064
nm excitation. (C) Variation in the TPL intensity at 660 nm with the
square of the intensity of 1064 nm incident light. We varied the laser
power density from 10 to 25 W/cm2. The linear plot indicates
that photoluminescence is indeed a two-photon process. (D) Variation
in the TPL intensity with time, indicating that anti-PSMA antibody-attached
MoS2 QDs exhibit very good photostability. For this experiment,
we used a laser power density of 40 W/cm2.

By using eq 1 and
counting the integrated luminescence intensity for the MoS2 QDs and the standard, the photoluminescence QY for the transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs was determined to be 13.2%,
which is about 1 order of magnitude higher than the reported QY for
a MOS2 single-layer nanosheet.4−14

As reported in Figure 2A, the photoluminescence of the transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs can be changed by varying the excitation energy.
Although the exact origin of the excitation-dependent single-photon
luminescence of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs is not known, there are several factors that might contribute
to this, including (1) ground state heterogeneity of MoS2 QDs due to their polydispersity, (2) the possibility of there being
multiple discrete electronic states due to the presence of different
types of aggregates, and (3) variation in the hot fluorescence from
the K point of the Brillouin zone5−15 due to the polydispersity of the transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs.

2.2 Two-Photon Absorption and
Two-Photon Brightness
of the MoS2 QDs
As we discussed earlier, light
in the second biological window (between 950 and 1350 nm) has to be
used for biological imaging to avoid absorption by physiological fluids.19−32 As shown in Figure 2A, single-photon luminescence can be observed from the transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs up to 532 nm excitation,
which indicates that the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs are not suitable for biological imaging applications using light
in the NIR biological II window. Thus, for biological imaging using
transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs, TPL imaging will
be the best choice. Next, we explored the possible use of MoS2 QDs as a two-photon imaging material. For the two-photon
absorption and imaging experiments, we used an 80 MHz Ti:sapphire
laser as an excitation source with a 100 fs pulse width and 80 MHz
repetition rate, as we have reported before.27,29,31,34 For measurements
in the biological II window, tunable wavelengths between 700 and 1100
nm were generated using an optical parametric amplifier.27,29,31,34−37 For TPL imaging using MoS2 QDs, we used a Nikon multiphoton
microscope (FV1000MPE).27,29,31,34−37Figure 2B shows the TPL spectra of the transition
metal dichalcogenides MoS2 QDs at an excitation of 1064
nm. The observed λmax for TPL emission is 660 nm,
which matches quite well with the single-photon luminescence λmax (659 nm) at 532 nm excitation, as reported in Figure 2A. Figure 2C shows the excitation wavelength
power-dependent plot for 1064 nm excitation light, which indicates
that the photoluminescence intensity from the transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs at 660 nm is proportional to the square of the
1064 nm excitation light intensity. The linear plots clearly confirm
that the observed photoluminescence at 660 nm is indeed a two-photon
process. Using fluorescein as the reference, whose QY has been determined
to be 0.9, the TPL QY for the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs was determined to be 0.08. The observed two-photon QY
for the MoS2 QDs is slightly lower than the observed single-photon
QY. This can be due to the charging process via Auger recombination.
Since the charging process occurs on a subnanosecond time scale, it
is much faster than what is measurable using conventional single-photon
photoluminescence spectroscopy. Because we used a femtosecond laser
for measuring the TPL QY, Auger recombination is more likely for this
case than it is for the single-photon QY measurement using normal
fluorescence spectroscopy.

Because the TPL intensity of the
transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs is dependent on
the two-photon absorption cross-section (σ2p) of
the MoS2 QDs and the luminescence QY (ΦL) of the MoS2 QDs, we used TPL spectra to determine the
two-photon absorption cross-section of MoS2 QDs. For this
purpose, fluorescein was used as a reference, whose two-photon absorption
cross-section at different excitation wavelengths is known,28 and σ2p for the MoS2 QDs was obtained using eq 2.20−27 2  where F is the observed
fluorescence
intensity, Φ is the quantum yield, and C is
the concentration. From the experimental TPL data, the two-photon
absorption cross-section for the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs at 1064 nm was determined to be 58 960 GM, which
is several orders of magnitude higher than that of organic dyes (11
GM for fluorescein at 880 nm excitation38) and much higher than that of semiconductor QDs (10 300 GM for CdSe
QDs).20−30 Two-photon brightness, defined as σ × Φ, was determined
to be 4.7 × 103 GM, which is very good for bright
TPL imaging.

2.3 Photostability and Biocompatibility
of the
Antibody-Conjugated MoS2 QDs and Their Use for Targeted
Two-Photon Imaging of Live Cancer Cells
Because bioimaging
using excitation with two-photon NIR light is a next-generation bioimaging
approach,20−30 we explored whether the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs can serve as a highly promising TPL imaging contrast
probe due to their very high two-photon absorption cross-section and
two-photon brightness. Because prostate cancer is the second leading
cause of cancer deaths in men in the USA, after lung cancer,39 we explored the possible use of an anti-PSMA
antibody attached to the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs for live prostate cancer cell imaging.

To accomplish this,
MoS2 QDs were modified with lipoic acid (LA)-terminated
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to improve their stability in physiological
solutions using a reported method.11−14 During this process, LA covalently
bonds to the edges of MoS2 to produce a PEG-LA-MoS2 conjugate.11−14 In the next step, an anti-PSMA antibody was attached to the MoS2 QDs via PEG to allow their use in targeted imaging. For this
purpose, the anti-PSMA antibody was attached to the PEG-MoS2 QDs via EDC/NHS chemistry, as we and others have reported before.11,13,27,29,31,34 DLS data,
as reported in Table 1, indicate that the average size of the PEG-LA-MoS2 QDs
is about 16 ± 3 nm and that for PSMA-antibody-PEG-LA-MoS2 QDs is about 25 ± 4 nm. Because photostability is one
of the most important parameters for two-photon imaging, we performed
a continuous femtosecond laser illumination experiment using light
in the biological I and II windows for 90 min to understand the photostability
of the anti-PSMA antibody-attached transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs. Figure 2G indicates that the TPL signal intensities at 435, 520, and
660 nm remain unchanged until 90 min of illumination. The experimental
data show that the photostability of the anti-PSMA antibody-attached
MoS2 QDs is very good, thus indicating that they can be
used as a TPL material. The observed TPL is found to be intense and
does not blink, which could be due to the good crystalline quality
of the MoS2 QDs, as reported in Figure 1E.

Because biocompatibility is one
of the most important factors for
live cell imaging, we performed biocompatibility experiments for anti-PSMA
antibody-attached MoS2 QDs. We used silver nitrate as a
standard to compare the cellular toxicity. For this purpose, 3.9 ×
105 LnCaP cells/mL and 3.9 × 105 HaCaT
cells/mL were incubated with anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs for different time intervals. In the next step, the cell viability
was measured using trypan blue and MTT colorimetric tests to determine
the amount of living and dead cells after incubation. As reported
in Figure 3, the trypan
blue and MTT tests clearly indicate that even after a 24 h incubation
with LnCaP cancer cells, 98% cell viability was observed. On the other
hand, more than 95% cells were dead after a 24 h incubation with silver
nitrate, as shown in Figure 3D, which indicates the very good biocompatibility of the anti-PSMA
antibody-attached MoS2 QDs.

Figure 3 (A) Bright-field inverted
microscope images of HaCaT normal skin
cells after a 24 h incubation with transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs. Cells were stained with trypan blue, which indicates
no cell death after the 24 h incubation. (B) Bright-field inverted
microscope images of LnCaP prostate cancer cells after a 24 h incubation

stained with trypan blue, which indicates no cell death after the
24 h incubation. (C) Plot of the biocompatibility of the anti-PSMA
antibody-attached transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs

cells. The data indicate that even after a 24 h incubation, about
98% of cells were viable for both the LnCaP cancer and HaCaT normal
cells. (D) Bright-field inverted microscope images of LNCaP prostate
cancer cells after a 24 h incubation with silver nitrate. Cells were
stained with trypan blue, which indicates a significant amount of
cell death after the 24 h incubation. (E) Intracellular reactive oxygen
species formation upon exposure of HaCaT normal cells to PEG-LA-MOS2 QDs during an 8 h incubation.

To further explore the biocompatibility of the MoS2 QDs,
we performed an intercellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation
assay. For this purpose, we exposed HaCaT cells to MoS2 QDs for different time intervals and monitored the formation of
ROS using a proprietary cell-permeable fluorogenic probe (Cell Biolabs,
Inc., San Diego, CA). Control experiments were performed using cell-containing-only
media. We performed fluorescence measurements using 480 nm excitation,
and emission data at 530 nm was recorded using a multimode microplate
reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). As reported in Figure 3E, we did not observe increased
intracellular ROS production by MoS2 QDs even up to 7 h
of incubation when compared with PBS as a control.

Next, for
the two-photon imaging experiment, we incubated anti-PSMA
antibody-attached transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs
with different concentrations of LnCaP prostate cancer cells for 30
min. After that, unconjugated anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs were separated using centrifugation followed by washing
with buffer three times to make sure that QDs not bound to prostate
cancer cells were separated. To understand whether anti-PSMA antibody-attached
transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QD-based TPL imaging
is selective for targeted LnCaP prostate cancer cell imaging, we incubated
anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs with 9.2 × 104 cells/mL of nontargeted HaCaT skin cells. After 30 min of
incubation, anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs were separated
using centrifugation followed by washing with buffer three times to
make sure that QDs not bound to prostate cancer cells were separated. Figure 4A shows an HRTEM
image, which clearly indicates that anti-PSMA antibody-attached transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs are attached to the LnCaP
prostate cancer cell surface. On the other hand, as reported in Figure 4B, TEM clearly indicates
that anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs are not bound
to the surface of HaCaT normal skin cells after incubation with anti-PSMA
antibody-attached MoS2 QDs for 30 min followed by separating
unconjugated QDs using centrifugation and washing with buffer three
times.

show that anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs do not bind
the HaCaT normal skin cells. (E) Bright-field image of LnCaP human
prostate cancer cells after incubation with anti-PSMA antibody-attached
MoS2 QDs followed by separation by centrifugation. (F)
TPL imaging of anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs incubated
with LnCaP prostate cancer cells using 1064 nm excitation. For TPL
imaging, we used a laser power density of 25 W/cm2. The
data shows that the anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs
are also able to penetrate the cell membrane and localize inside the
cells. (G) Percentage of cells attached to anti-PSMA antibody-conjugated
MoS2 QDs when a mixture of (105 cells/mL each)
HER2(+) SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, PSMA(+) LnCaP human prostate
cancer cells, and CD34(+) stem cells was incubated with anti-PSMA
antibody-attached MoS2 QDs for 30 min followed by separating
the MoS2 QD-attached cells by centrifugation.

The data clearly show that anti-PSMA antibody-attached
transition
metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs are bound only to targeted
cells. Figure 4F shows
TPL imaging of LnCaP prostate cancer cells using a 1064 nm excitation
wavelength. The TPL imaging data clearly demonstrate that the extremely
bright TPL properties can be used for bioimaging using light in the
biological II window. On the other hand, the TPL image of HaCaT cells
in Figure 4D clearly
demonstrates that nontargeted normal skin cells do not bind the anti-PSMA
antibody-attached transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs,
and as a result, no TPL image was observed. All of these data clearly
show that the anti-PSMA antibody-attached transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QD-based TPL imaging is highly selective for targeted
LnCaP prostate cancer cells. The data in Figure 4F indicate that anti-PSMA antibody-attached
transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs not only are localized
in the proximity of the LnCAP prostate cancer cell membrane but also
are also able to penetrate the cell membrane and localize inside the
cell. As reported by us and others, small size nanoparticles can be
internalized into cells either via the classic endocytic or nonendocytotic
pathway.18,29,32 Since the
size of the anti-PSMA antibody-attached transition metal dichalcogenide
MoS2 QDs is small, particles can enter the cells via both
endocytic and nonendocytotic pathways.

To understand the real
selectivity of the particles, we performed
an experiment using a coculture with three cells lines: PSMS(+) LNCaP
human prostate cancer cells, HER2(+) SK-Br-3 human breast cancer cells,
and CD34(+) bone marrow stem cells. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays, we found that no PSMA is present in SK-Br-3 human breast cancer
cells and CD34(+) bone marrow stem cells. For demonstrating selectivity,
we incubated anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs with
105 cells/mL PSAM(+) LNCaP prostate cancer cells, 105 cells/mL HER2(+) SK-Br-3 human breast cancer cells, and 105 cells/mL CD34(+) bone marrow stem cells. After incubating
the anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs with the cell
mixture for 30 min, cells that were not conjugated to the anti-PSMA
antibody-attached MoS2 QDs were separated using centrifugation,
followed by washing with buffer three times. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays, we found that only HER2(+) and CD34(+) cells were present
in the fractions of the cell suspension that did not bind to the MoS2 QDs. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 4G, we found only PSMA(+) cells bound to the
MoS2 QDs. These data clearly show that anti-PSMA antibody-attached
MoS2 QDs are highly selective for PSMA(+) LNCaP human prostate
cancer cells.

3 Conclusions
In this
article, we have reported the development of zero-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs using a bottom-up
hydrothermal method, which exhibits very strong two-photon photoluminescence.
Our experimental data show that MoS2 QDs exhibit very high
two-photon absorption properties with a TPA cross-section of 58 960
GM, which is several orders of magnitude higher than that of organic
dyes and much higher than that of semiconductor QDs. We have demonstrated
that due to their extremely high two-photon brightness of ∼4.7
× 103 GM, high photostability, and very good biocompatibility,
anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs can be used for multiphoton
imaging of live prostate cancer LnCaP cells. The data demonstrate
that MoS2 QD-based two-photon imaging using light in the
biological II window is capable of distinguishing targeted prostate
cancer LnCaP cells from other nontargeted cells. The observed bright
TPL imaging of selective cancer cells, photostability, and biocompatibility
make the antibody-attached MoS2 QDs a good candidate for
use as a TPL imaging material for cancer in clinical environments.

of MoS2 QDs
The MoS2 QDs were synthesized
using a bottom-up hydrothermal
method,12−16 as shown in Figure 1A. For this purpose, Na2MoO4·2H2O was used as the source of Mo and l-cysteine was used as
the S precursor. Typically, 0.5 g of solid Na2MoO4·2H2O was dissolved in a beaker containing 50 mL
of water and sonicated for 5 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted
to 6.5 with diluted HCl. In another beaker, 1.0 g of l-cysteine
was dissolved in 50 mL of water, followed by sonication for 10 min.
Both solutions were transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless
steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 36 h. The resulting
black suspensions were separated by centrifugation at 12 000
rpm for 30 min. Solid MoS2 QDs were obtained by evaporation
of the solvent followed by lyopholization. At the end, the purified
particles were characterized by HRTEM, EDX spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
and DLS measurements, as reported in Figure 1 and Table 1.

4.2 Development of Anti-PSMA
Antibody-Conjugated
MoS2 QDs
For the targeted capture and imaging
of human prostate cancer LnCaP cells, an anti-PSMA antibody was attached
to the fluorescent MoS2 QDs. To accomplish this, MoS2 QDs were modified with LA-terminated PEG to improve their
stability in physiological solutions using a reported method.11−14 During this process, LA covalently bonds to the edges of MoS2 to produce a PEG-LA-MoS2 conjugate.11−14 In the next step, the anti-PSMA antibody was attached to the MoS2 QDs via PEG for their use in targeted imaging. For this purpose,
the anti-PSMA antibody was attached to PEG-MoS2 via EDC/NHS
chemistry, as we and others have reported.11,13,27,29,31,34

4.3 Cell
Culture and Incubation with Transition
Metal Dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs
We purchased human
prostate cancer LaCaP and normal skin HaCaT cells from ATCC and grew
them according to ATCC’s procedure, as we have reported before.37 Once the culture reached more than 106 cells/mL, different concentrations of anti-PSMA antibody-attached
MoS2 QDs were mixed with the different cell lines for 30
min. After that, unconjugated anti-PSMA antibody-attached MoS2 QDs were separated using centrifugation followed by washing
with buffer three times to make sure that QDs not bound to cells were
separated.

4.4 Two-Photon Absorption Coefficient
Measurement
and Two-Photon Imaging
For two-photon absorption and imaging
experiments, we used an 80 MHz Ti:sapphire laser as an excitation
source with a 100 fs pulse width and 80 MHz repetition rate, as we
have reported before.27,29,32,34−37 For measurements in the biological
II window, light of tunable wavelengths between 700 and 1100 nm was
generated using an optical parametric amplifier. For TPL imaging using
MoS2 QDs, we used a Nikon multiphoton microscope (FV1000MPE),
as we have reported before.27,29,31,34−37

4.5 Cell
Viability Assay
To study the
cytotoxicity of the transition metal dichalcogenide MoS2 QDs, different numbers of cancer and normal cells were treated with
the MoS2 QDs for different time intervals. At the end,
we measured cell viability using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) assay. For the MTT assay, we measured the absorbance at 540
nm using a Multiskan Ascent plate reader with Ascent software
(Labsystems), as reported previously.36,37
