We report here the synthesis and
thermotropic properties of novel
short-core hockey stick-shaped liquid crystalline molecules based
on the 1,3,4-thiadiazole core. Polar switching behavior is observed
in the cybotactic nematic and smectic mesophases for the bent-core
thiadiazole derivatives. The presence of the lateral methoxy moiety
in the outer phenyl ring of the four-ring molecules facilitates the
formation of spontaneous ordering in the nematic phase observed via
X-ray diffraction measurements. Anomalous temperature dependence of
spontaneous polarization on cooling is explained by the possible antiferroelectric
packing of the molecules that require higher electric field for switching.
The compounds exhibited a strong absorption band at ∼356 nm
and a blue emission band at ∼445 nm with a good quantum yield
of φf ∼0.39. The mega Stokes shift is observed
and depends on the nature of the solvent.

Introduction
Nematic phase is the
most technologically important and least ordered
mesophase and the backbone of the multibillion-dollar display industry
which serves for the upliftment of the status of human living during
the last two decades. Modulation in this nematic phase, like the formation
of twist-bend heliconical structure or macroscopic biaxiality, is
the thrust area of contemporary liquid crystal (LC) research due to
their promising potentiality for use in ultrafast switching devices.
The available theory that correlates the reduced symmetry in biaxial
nematics (NB) or spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in
twist-bend nematics (NTB) and modulated molecular structures
with relevant features of molecular interactions is not yet completely
resolved. It has been well predicted that the introduction of bent
curvature in molecular architecture can lead to stabilize these modulations
via formation of biaxial ordering1 or by
inducing twist-bend helicity in the nematic phase.2 Hence, a good number of bent-core molecules have been synthesized
that exhibited nematic ordering having a rich variety of complexity
of molecular structures regarding the bending unit (bent angle and
polarity), linking moieties between two aromatic rings (direction
and polarity), substitutions at the outer and/or core unit (position,
size, and polarity), terminal chains (nature and length), and so forth.3 Unfortunately, till today, there is no unambiguous
claim of biaxial nematogens that can revolutionize the modern LC-based
switching device technology. The biaxiality in the nematic ordering
arise due to the formation of macroscopic-sized clusters by the intermolecular
coupling and preorganization of the constituent molecules4 and is known as “Holy-Grail of LC science”.5

The incorporation of heterocyclic rings
such as 1,3-oxazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole,
1,2,4-oxadiazole, triazole, thiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, and so forth,
instead of usual 1,3-disubstituted phenyl or naphthalene moiety, as
a core unit in bent-core LCs produces new multifunctional materials
due to the presence of the heteroatoms which provides a reduced symmetry,
strong lateral and/or longitudinal dipole, and donor–acceptor
interaction within the molecule that change polarity, polarizability,
and geometry of the molecule which in turn affects the self-assembly
process of the mesophase, transition temperature, electronic behavior,
dielectric biaxiality, and other mesomorphic properties. Of these
heterocyclic bent-core units, the use of the 2,5-disubstituted 1,3,4-thiadiazole
unit in bent-core compounds exhibiting the nematic phase is rare and
limited.6 The majority of the 2,5-disubstituted
1,3,4-thiadiazole-based mesogens reported in the literature are either
rod-shaped or rod bent-shaped molecules, exhibiting conventional nematic
and smectic phases at the higher temperature.7 Very recently, we have reported new four-ring hockey-stick LCs of
1,3,4-oxadiazole8 and 1,3,4-thiadiazole
bent-core units.9 It is observed that most
of the 1,3,4- oxadiazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole-derived compounds exhibited
the nematic phase. It is interesting to note that the terminal chain
of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole-based hockey stick-shaped molecule drastically
influences the mesophase behavior. The lower chain length exhibited
the nematic phase, whereas the higher chain length displayed the SmA
phase. Further, the isotropic temperature of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole-based
molecules are quite high (∼300–350 °C). The high
isotropic temperature of the 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-thiadiazole compounds
which restricts the characterization of the phase and limits the application
of the materials in display devices. The transition temperature and
the phase behavior of the heterocyclic-based bent-core mesogens are
sensitive to the structural modification, in particular, lateral substitution
or functionalization of the molecule.10

Therefore, we have designed and synthesized a new series of
hockey
stick-shaped molecules containing the 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole
derivative, possessing a lateral methoxy moiety in the terminal phenyl
ring at the long arm of the molecule in order to understand the phase
behavior. The compounds are shown to exhibit an ordered pattern in
the nematic phase observed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements.
Most importantly, polar switching is observed in the lower part of
the nematic and smectic phase in these thiadiazole-based compounds.
The blue light emission band at ∼445 nm with a good quantum
yield of φf ∼0.39 was also observed in these
materials.

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis
1,3,4-Thiadiazole-derived
new
hockey stick-shaped short-core molecules possessing the lateral methoxy
moiety at the terminal phenyl ring located in the long arm of the
molecular framework having an imine linkage have been designed. The
molecule is an unsymmetrical bent-core molecule, possessing two arms
of different lengths. Of these, one arm contains two phenyl rings
and is considered to be the longer arm of the molecule, containing
the 4-n-alkyloxy chain of different lengths (4-n-butyloxy or 4-n-octyloxy or 4-n-dodecyloxy or 4-n-octadecyloxy), while
the 4-n-butyloxy chain at the other arm of the molecule
is considered to be the shorter arm of the molecule, possessing one
phenyl ring. The methoxy group is introduced at the terminal phenyl
ring of the elongated arm of the molecule. Detailed synthesis of the
compounds is represented in Scheme 1 and was carried out via the following procedure as
elaborated in the Experimental Section. The
intermediate compound, 2-(4′-nitrophenyl)-5-(4″-n-butyloxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (1), was
synthesized by reaction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid-N′-(4′-n-butyloxybenzoyl)hydrazide with Lawesson’s reagent
in dry toluene under the nitrogen atmosphere. Further, the nitro group
of compound (1) was reduced using stannous chloride to
produce 2-(4′-aminophenyl)-5-(4″-butyloxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole
(2). 3-Methoxy-4-n-alkyloxy-benzaldehydes
(3) were synthesized by Williamson etherification reaction
of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde (vanillin) with n-alkyl bromides. Schiff base condensation of 3-methoxy-4-n-alkyloxy-benzaldehydes (3) with 2-(4′-aminophenyl)-5-(4″-butyloxy)phenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole
(2) was used to obtain hockey stick-shaped molecules
containing 1,3,4-thiadiazole (CV-nT).
The high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and elemental analysis
of the synthesized compounds were in consistent with the targeted
molecular formula which in turn confirmed the pureness of the compounds
(see Supporting Information, Figure S4).
The characteristic Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectra of the compounds
(CV-nT) are presented in Supporting Information, Figure S1. The FT-IR
spectra of the CV-nT compounds showed
the typical peaks of the thiadiazole ring of ∼1070 cm–1 for (=C–S–C=) and 1607 cm–1 for (−C=N−) stretching. The stretching frequency
of the imine (−CH=N−) linkage was in the range
of 1625–1635 cm–1. The stretching frequency
of −C=N– in the thiadiazole ring and the linking
−CH=N– moiety overlap with each other making
it hard to distinguish the linking imine moiety from the thiadiazole
(−C=N−) moiety. The observed singlet peak at
the range of δ = 8.61–8.58 ppm corresponds to imine proton
(−CH=N−) of the compounds, which
approved the formation of the Schiff base moiety. The methoxy proton
(−OCH3) showed a singlet
peak at δ = 3.98 ppm. All other protons in the aromatic region
was found to be in the range of δ = 6.52–8.06 ppm (see Supporting Information, Figure S2a–d). 13C NMR spectra were in good agreement with the final molecular
structure of the compounds (Supporting Information, Figure S3a–c).

Mesophase Behavior
Polarizing
Optical Microscope and Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Study
The phase transition temperatures, associated enthalpy,
and entropy of the synthesized new thiadiazole-based hockey stick-shaped
molecules CV-nT (n = 4, 8, 12, and 18) obtained from differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) at a scan rate of 5 °C min–1 in the second
heating and cooling scans are summarized in Table 1. The mesomorphic behavior of the new hockey
stick-shaped molecules was investigated under polarizing optical microscopy
(POM) with crossed polarizers. All the new compounds CV-nT (n = 4, 8, 12, and
18) exhibited the nematic phase with underlying smectic C phases.
The compound CV-4T on heating melts at 132.4 °C
to a focal conic texture which on further heating results in the observation
of the schlieren texture at 153.8 °C and finally becomes isotropic
liquid at 272.8 °C. The compound CV-4T on slow cooling
from the isotropic liquid, droplet texture of the nematic phase appeared
at 269.0 °C. The nematic droplets coalesce to from the schlieren
texture and immediately transform to the homeotropic texture. On further
cooling, the weak birefringent greenish-color homogenous optical texture
grows from the background of the homeotropic texture at 225.6 °C
named as the NCyb phase. On further cooling, an arc-like
texture appeared from the weakly birefringent optical texture and
finally transformed into a focal conic texture at 145.8 °C. The
optical textures of CV-4T are presented in Supporting Information, Figure S5a. The compound CV-8T on heating melts at 97.9 °C to the focal conic
texture which on further heating transforms to the schlieren/droplet
texture at 175.9 °C and finally becomes isotropic liquid at 234.4
°C. On slow cooling, the sample from the isotropic liquid, droplet
texture of the N phase appeared at 233.4 °C (see Figure 1a). The droplet texture coalesces
to form the schlieren texture with the appearance of the secondary
schlieren texture at 232.0 °C (Figure 1b). The formation of the secondary schlieren
texture is attributed to nonsingular domain walls which nucleate during
the surface anchoring transition in an uniaxial nematic phase as reported
in bent-core 1,3,4-oxadiazole-based molecules.11 On further cooling, the homeotropic domain appeared in
the texture, and finally, the texture becomes the weakly birefringent
greenish texture at 190.0 °C (see Figure 1c). The batonnet-like texture developed from
the greenish texture as a distinct transition (Figure 1d) at 177.0 °C, and finally the batonnets
coalesce to form a focal conic-like texture (Figure 1e) at 170.0 °C. On further cooling,
the broken focal conic texture appeared and transformed to schlieren
textures at 130.5 °C (Figure 1f) and finally crystallized below 100.0 °C. The
similar phase behavior was observed for the long-chain compounds (CV-12T and CV-18T) (see Supporting Information, Figure S5b,c).

J mol–1 K–1), respectively, are
presented in parentheses.

b Indicates the transition observed
by POM only.

Further, the
thermal behavior of all the new hockey stick-shaped
LC compounds was also examined with DSC on both second heating and
second cooling at the rate of 5 °C min–1 under
the nitrogen atmosphere. Phase transition temperatures obtained from
DSC are agreed well with microscopy observations (see Table 1). From Table 1, it is further noted that the thermal stability
of the synthesized compounds increases with increase in the chain
length (4-n-alkyloxy), and their decomposition temperature
is ∼150 °C above the isotropic temperature, indicating
high thermal stability of the compounds which is suited for the physical
measurement without the decomposition of the sample. The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) thermogram
of the mesogenic compounds (CV-nT) are
presented in Supporting Information, Figure
S7.

As revealed in the representative DSC thermogram in Figure 2, the compound CV-8T exhibits the enantiotropic nematic phase over a wide
temperature
range with four endothermic phase transitions, namely, crystal to
smectic C (Cr–SmC), smectic C to NCyb (SmC–NCyb), NCyb to N, and nematic to isotropic (N–Iso).
The measurable isotropic to nematic transitions are associated with
a low enthalpy value (0.59 kJ mol–1) and low entropy
value (1.17 J mol–1 K–1). Further,
on careful insights into the nematic transition, two noticeable transitions
are observed having vanishingly small enthalpy and were detected during
N–NCyb phase transition, indicating that the two
phases are closely related in structure (see inset of Figure 2). It is noted that the N–NCyb transition temperature window is quite narrow (∼2
°C). Therefore, the N–NCyb transition enthalpy
change could not be detected. The lower value of the enthalpy and
entropy change during the transition indicated the small change in
the ordering of the molecules in the phase. Moreover, hardly any measurable
enthalpy change values associated for the NCyb–N
transitions and NCyb–SmC transition are found which
can be compared to Iso–N transition, indicating a cybotactic
cluster formation in these nematic phases, that is, layer fragments
already exist in the nematic phase and are clubbed to infinite layers
at the phase transition.12 These N–NCyb transitions were observed in all the other compounds. However,
because of the narrow temperature window and the enthalpy change,
it is difficult to calculate their associated enthalpy change during
the transition. The DSC thermogram of the other compounds is presented
in Supporting Information, Figure S6.

XRD Study
In order to understand the characteristics
of the observed phase structure exhibited by the compounds, detailed
X-ray investigation was carried out via small- and wide-angle XRD
(SAXS/WAXS) measurements. The samples were filled in thin capillaries
(0.5 mm) and aligned via repeated heating and cooling. All the compounds
exhibited nematic and smectic phase structures at higher and lower
temperatures, respectively.

As a representative case, the diffractogram
of compound CV-8T at 200 °C comprised one small-angle
peak with a d-value of 34.27 Å and a broad peak
at a wide angle which designate to the liquid-like order of the alkyl
chains (see Figure 3). Additionally, a small peak was observed in the wide-angle region
with a d-value of 3.54 Å which signifies the
presence of core–core correlation between the molecules. During
cooling the sample, the small-angle peak gradually became sharper.
At 120 °C, the observed d-value of 28.40 Å
which is lower than the molecular length (L) of ∼34
Å and a d/L ratio of 0.83 signifies
the presence of tilt ordering in the smectic layers. Additionally,
in the smectic phase, the second-order reflection peak with a d-value of 14.15 Å was observed.

and smectic phase of CV-8T at 200 °C (red colored)
and 100 °C (black colored), respectively.
Inset shows the zoomed area of the mid-angle regime (left), exhibiting
the appearance of the (002) peak in the Sm phase, zoomed area.

As a representative case, detailed
XRD analysis of the compound CV-8T and CV-4T has been carried out to explain
the ordering phenomena in the nematic phase. Both the compounds exhibited
the nematic (N) phase at the higher temperature and the smectic (Sm)
phase at the lower temperature. In order to understand the behavior
of the N and Sm phase, azimuthal and radial plots of the first peak
of the small-angle peak have been calculated. The small-angle peak
of the N phase is found to be azimuthally bifurcated, and the bifurcation
is prominent with decreasing the temperature in the nematic phase.
The 2D XRD image of the cybotatic nematic ordering of CV-8T and CV-4T at different temperatures is presented in Figure 4 and Supporting Information, Figures S8 and S9. However,
the bifurcated peak transforms to a single peak in the smectic phase.
In the nematic phase of compound CV-8T, the azimuthal
plot of the small-angle peak displays its bifurcated nature (Figure 5a). However, the
first small-angle peak of the smectic phase is azimuthally single
(Figure 5c). The angular
separation of the bifurcated peak is found to increase from ∼60°
to ∼75° with decreasing temperature, and the respective
average angular full width at half-maximum (fwhm) (average of the
bifurcated peak) is found to decrease linearly from ∼51°
to ∼26° in the nematic phase and suddenly decreases to
∼14° in the smectic phase (Figure 6a). The observation of the bifurcated peak
confirms the two different preferential orientations in the nematic
phase which is due self-arrangement of the molecules in the nematic
phase and could be attributed to the cybotactic nature of the nematic
phase. Further, the radial plot exhibits single peak in the nematic
as well as in the smectic phase (Figure 5b,d). The measured d-spacing
and correlation length are shown in Figure 6b. The d-spacing decreases
slowly from ∼35 to 34 Å in the nematic phase and suddenly
to 30 Å in the smectic phase with the decreasing temperature.
However, the correlation length increases slowly in the nematic phase
(from ∼40 to ∼55 Å) and then increases suddenly
to 140 Å in the smectic phase. On the other hand, in the nematic
phase of compound CV-4T, the azimuthal plot of the small-angle
peak also displays its bifurcated nature (Figure 7a), and the first small-angle peak of the
smectic phase is also azimuthally single (Figure 7c). However, the angular separation of the
bifurcated peak is found to increase from ∼61° to ∼76°
and then decrease to ∼74° with decreasing the temperature,
and the respective average angular fwhm (average of the bifurcated
peak) is found to decrease from ∼62° to ∼44°
and then increase to ∼48° in the nematic phase and then
suddenly decrease to ∼37° in the smectic phase (Figure 8a). Further, the
radial plot exhibits a single peak in the nematic and in smectic phase
(Figure 7b,d). The
measured d-spacing and correlation length are shown
in the Figure 8b. The d-spacing decreases slowly from ∼30 to 27 Å
in the nematic mesophase and then to 25 Å in the smectic phase
with decreasing temperature. However, the correlation length in the
nematic phase increases slowly (from ∼31 to ∼50 Å)
and then increases suddenly to 124 Å in the smectic phase.

Electric Field Studies
The possibility of polar switching
is examined for one representative sample CV-8T. To the
best of our knowledge, no study has been reported on a measurement
of the spontaneous polarization of thiadiazole-based short bent-core
LCs. Under an applied triangular wave voltage, only a feeble and broad
current peak (peak A) is observed per half cycle in the isotropic
and high-temperature side of the nematic phase up to 195 °C (Figure 9a). As the temperature
is lowered, another small peak appears at the right side of peak A
and is designated as peak B. Peak B gradually becomes a prominent
single peak on cooling (below 170 °C), while peak A remains almost
the same (Figure 9a–d).
Based on the temperature dependence, the current peaks A and B can
be interpreted as follows: As peak A is almost temperature-independent
and present in all the mesophases including the isotropic phase, it
can be designated as an ionic peak. However, peak B is strongly temperature-dependent
and completely vanishes far below the isotropic–nematic transition.
Thus, the possibility of its ionic origin is ruled out, and it is
considered as a polarization current peak. The intensity of current
peak B increases on cooling up to 160 °C. As the sample is further
cooled, the intensity of the current peak starts decreasing. A similar
decrease of polar peak intensity on cooling is observed earlier in
oxadiazole13 and resorcinol14-based bent-core molecules in the smectic phase
near Sm–Cr transition. At ∼115 °C, SmC–SmCA transition occurs, and a small additional peak can be seen
to overlap with peak A and is designated as A′ (Figure 9e). Spontaneous polarization
(PS) is measured by calculating the area
under peak B (Figure 9f). PS varies from ∼76 nC/cm2 at 195 °C to a maximum value of ∼155 nC/cm2 at 160 °C. Below this point, PS decreases continuously as Sm–Cr transition is approached
and takes the lowest value of ∼82 nC/cm2. The decreasing
trend of polarization on cooling can be attributed to the stronger
antiferroelectric packing of the molecules that require higher electric
field for switching.15

(f) Temperature dependence of polarization PS in all mesophases.

Next, we investigated the optical switching behavior in different
mesophases before and after applying the electric field (Figure 10) under the polarizing
microscope. No abrupt change of texture is observed in the nematic
phase after applying field (Figure 10a,b). However, in the smectic phases, textural changes
can be noticed, although the color remains almost the same (Figure 10c–f). The
chiral domains get well defined after applying electric field, but
the extinction regions which are parallel to either of the polarizers
do not move. As confirmed by XRD, the smectic phases are tilted, and
hence the polarization reversals of the molecules are taking place
collectively around the long molecular axes,16 leaving the orientation of the direction unchanged.

Dielectric Studies
Compound CV-8T is investigated
by dielectric spectroscopy in the temperature range of 250–100
°C. Temperature-dependent complex dielectric permittivity is
obtained in the planar cell and dielectric data are fitted with the
Havriliak–Negami fitting function.17

By fitting the obtained dielectric data in the extended Havriliak–Negami
function (detailed notations of the equation are described in Supporting Information, page S19) the characteristic
parameters of dielectric study such as dielectric strength, relaxation
frequency, and so forth were extracted. 1  where Δεk is the dielectric strength and τk is the relaxation time of each individual
process k involved in dielectric relaxation, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 pF/m), σ0 is
the conduction parameter, and ω is the angular frequency. The
exponents α and β are empirical fit parameters, which
describe symmetric and non-symmetric broadening, respectively, of
the relaxation peaks. The first term on the right-hand side of eq 1 describes the motion of
free charge carriers in the sample. The exponent s of the angular frequency determines the nonlinearity of the dc conductivity
arising from charge accumulation at the interfacial layers. In the
case of Ohmic behavior (s = 1), σ0 is the Ohmic conductivity of the smectic material.

The dielectric
spectra of compound CV-8T exhibited
typically two distinct relaxations: one at low-frequency region (∼70
Hz to 4 kHz), denoted as peak P1, and the other at high-frequency
region (∼100 kHz to 6 MHz), designated as P2 (Figure 11a). The origin
of P2 can be identified as rotation of the molecules along
their short axes, while the low-frequency peak P1 can be
attributed to collective motion of the bent-core molecules. Such low-frequency
collective modes have been observed earlier in oxadiazole-based compounds13 and four ring bent-core LCs.18 The dielectric strength of peak P1 (δε1) shows strong temperature dependence, and the transition
from the N–NCyb phase and NCyb–SmC
phase can be distinctly identified (Figure 11b). δε1 increases
on cooling in the nematic phase but tend to decrease near N–NCyb transition, attaining minima and again rises sharply in
the NCyb phase. In the SmC phase, δε1 has the highest value of ∼50 but decreases slightly on cooling.
In the SmCA phase, the dielectric strength decreases rapidly
owing to strong antiferroelectric ordering among the molecules. The
relaxation frequency (fR1) is the highest
at high-temperature nematic phase (∼4 MHz) and continuously
decreases up to 66 Hz at 100 °C due to increase in viscosity
of the medium which impedes the collective motion of the molecules.
The dielectric strength of P2 increases, and relaxation
frequency decreases monotonously on cooling (Figure 11c).

Photophysical Studies
In Dichloromethane
The photophysical
characteristics
of the hockey stick-shaped molecules were examined via UV–visible
absorption and emission spectroscopy in dichloromethane (DCM) solution.
The absorption and emission spectra of CV-4T, a representative
hockey stick-shaped compound in dilute DCM (c = 1
× 10–5 M), are presented in Figure 12a. An absorption maximum at
358 nm having high molar extinction coefficient (εmax = 59 500 M–1 cm–1) can
be attributed because of the spin-allowed π–π*
transition of the π-conjugated aromatic system involving the
phenylthiadiazole framework.9 The optical
energy band gap (Eg) of CV-4T as estimated from the onset of the absorption maxima was found to
be 3.03 eV. This small band gap of the compounds qualifies as the
prospective contender for application in organic light-emitting diodes
and organic semiconductors. The compound (CV-4T) in diluted
solution displayed an emission band in a region of 375–550
nm with maximum emission intensity in the violet region at 430 nm.
The emission peak appears at ∼430 nm with a Stokes shift of
about 72 nm (4677 cm–1). This large Stokes shift
arises because of the presence of a push–pull organization
in a molecule-like two strong electron-donating 4-n-alkoxy moiety and an electron-deficient 1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety.19 The large Stokes shift value reflects the structural
relaxation of the excited molecule and significant changes in molecular
conformation upon excitation.20 The solution
absorption spectra of other hockey stick-shaped compounds have almost
an identical absorption band λabs at ∼358
nm. Indeed, no considerable difference in absorption properties was
observed with the variance of terminal aliphatic chains.

(e) normalized fluorescence spectra of CV-4T in toluene

spectra of CV-4T.

Solvent Effect
The absorption spectra of CV-4T in different solvent polarities are shown in Figure 12b. The relevant data from absorption spectroscopy
are presented in Table 2, where the solvents are presented in order of increasing polarity.
It was noted that absorption spectra are fairly independent on the
solvent polarity, which clearly indicates that the dipole moment of
the ground state and corresponding Frank–Condon excited state
is similar. Interestingly, emission maxima are considerably red shifted
with increasing the solvent dipole moment (see Figure 12c). This may be explained by the fact that
upon excitation with UV-light, thiadiazole compounds were excited
to a higher level of vibrational energy of the first excited singlet
state, and additional vibrational energy was quickly dissipated into
neighboring molecules of solvent, gradually relaxing to the lowest
vibrational energy level. The neighboring solvent molecules assist
to stabilize and further lower the energy level of the excited state
by solvent relaxation around the excited fluorophores. This effect
of reduction in the energy separation among the ground and excited
states results in a red shift of the fluorescence emission. Upon increasing
the solvent dipole moment yields consistently greater reduction in
the energy level of the excited state, while reducing the solvent
polarity decreases the solvent effect on the excited state energy
level. Moreover, solvent relaxation effects in the fluorescence could
result in a dramatic consequence on the magnitude of Stokes shifts.
With the increase in the solvent dipole moment, the emission of the
compound (CV-4T) shifted from the violet (∼423
nm) to blue region (∼452 nm), and the Stokes shift value increases
on increasing the solvent polarity (see Figure 12d and Table 2). The compound in the high polar solvent, namely,
acetonitrile exhibit a large Stokes shift of 97 nm (6045 cm–1) nm, whereas the other low polar solvents have a Stokes shift value
of ∼71–89 nm (∼4768–5618 cm–1). Similar behavior is reported in the donor−π–acceptor
stilbene molecule.21 Therefore, such compounds
having a high Stokes shift value in polar solvents are the potential
candidate for use in the fluorescent sensors.22 The large Stokes shift and the solvatochromic effect in the excited
state depicts that these molecules exhibit charge separation, namely,
an intramolecular charge transfer character in the excited state (ICT
state).23 Furthermore, fluorescence quantum
yields (φf) in the solution state of the hockey stick-shaped
molecule were determined following the standard procedures, with quinine
sulfate in degassed 0.1 M H2SO4 as a reference
standard (φ = 0.54).24 Interestingly,
the compound CV-4T exhibits moderately high quantum yield
(φf ≈ 0.39) in the tetrahydrofuran solvent
as compared to the other solvents (see Table 2).

Concentration-Dependent
Emission Spectra
In the fluorescence
spectra of CV-4T at different concentrations in toluene
showed a small red shift (∼8 nm) on increase in the concentration
of the compound as depicted in Figure 12e. This red shift is due to the development
of the aggregated species with an increase in concentration of the
monomer which suggests the formation of the aggregates from monomer
concentration and the population of the J-aggregates increases.25 Similarly, the red shift is also observed in
DCM. Similar behavior was not observed in polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran
and acetonitrile. Interestingly, it was observed that in polar solvents,
the intensity of the peak decreases with increase in concentration
as presented in Figure 12f. At concentrations larger than 1 × 10–5 M, self-absorption starts to decrease the intensity of the emission
peak, but the spectral shape is or else unaffected up to 1 ×
10–4 M, signifying that merely intrinsic intramolecular
emission happens.26

Conclusions
A new series of 1,3,4-thiadiazole based on short-core hockey stick-shaped
molecules possessing a lateral methoxy group have been designed and
synthesized. The compounds exhibited a long range of the enantiotropic
nematic phase with an underlying tilted smectic ordering. The molecules
in the nematic phase are arranged in such a fashion to exhibit four-spot
pattern 2D images in XRD studies, indicating the presence of cybotactic
ordering. Polar switching was observed in the low-temperature nematic
region and smectic phases of CV-8T. It turns out to be
antiferroelectric organization near crystallization. This is an unusual
phenomenon of polar ordering in the nematic and smectic phases of
the thiadiazole-based hockey stick-shaped molecule. The compounds
showed a strong absorption band at ∼356 nm and a blue emission
band at ∼445 nm with a decent quantum yield of ∼0.39
in tetrahydrofuran as compared with other solvents. The mega Stokes
shift is observed, and the Stokes shift value increases on increasing
the polarity of the solvent.
