Noscapine (NOS) is efficient in inhibiting
cellular proliferation
and induces apoptosis in nonsmall cell, lung, breast, lymphatic, and
prostate cancers. The micelle-assisted drug delivery is a well-known
phenomenon; however, the proper mechanism is still unclear. Therefore,
in the present study, we have shown a mechanistic approach for the
delivery of NOS from sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles to calf
thymus deoxyribose nucleic acid (ctDNA) base-pairs using various spectroscopic
techniques. The absorption and emission spectroscopy results revealed
that NOS interacts with the SDS micelle and resides in its hydrophobic
core. Further, the intercalation of NOS from SDS micelles to ctDNA
was also shown by these techniques. The anisotropy and quenching results
further confirmed the relocation of NOS from SDS micelles to ctDNA.
The CD analysis suggested that SDS micelles do not perturb the structure
of ctDNA, which supported that SDS micelles can be used as a safe
delivery vehicle for NOS. This work may be helpful for the invention
of advanced micelle-based vehicles for the delivery of an anticancer
drug to their specific target site.

1 Introduction
Over
the past few decades, drug–DNA interactions have gained
interest in clinical applications and cancer research.1,2 A brief knowledge about the mechanism of drugs, such as identification
a drug molecule and its reversible binding to DNA, is important for
rational drug design and drug delivery. It is necessary to gain information
on drug–DNA complexes, binding mechanism, dynamics of complex
formation, and driving energies of the process. Mainly two types of
noncovalent interactions involve in drug–DNA binding, groove
binding and intercalation.3 Furthermore,
the information on specific drug delivery and the efficient drug released
are of great importance for pharmaceutical and drug development research.
Presently, poor bioavailability of anticancer drugs is a serious challenge
in pharmaceutical industry and cancer research. To resolve this issue,
surfactant systems are used as attractive vehicles for drug delivery.4,5 Because of its hydrophobic nature and electric charge, the drug
molecule can be solubilized into the core of the micelle or at the
surface or intermediate location in the palisade layer. In-depth understanding
about the mechanism of molecular interaction between drugs and surfactants
and their release to the target site is a significant aspect in the
formulation of a new drug molecule and its effective delivery.6 Solubilization of the drug in micelles results
in the enhancement of bioavailability and water solubility and eliminates
other adverse effects.7,8 Apart from the natural resemblance
with the biomimic models, micelles are spectroscopically silent and
scatter-free, accumulate in the required area, and remain optically
transparent. Therefore, in modern research, fluorophore drugs in the
presence of the micelles provide molecular level dynamics using spectroscopic
techniques.8

Noscapine (NOS) is a
phthalideisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Papaver
somniferum plant. It is antitussive and a
naturally tubulin-binding compound presently undergoing phase I/II
clinical trials for cancer treatment.9,10 Because of
low bioavailability and poor physiochemical properties, the therapeutic
concentration of NOS cannot be attained at the targeted sites. Additionally,
NOS is eliminated from plasma, visceral organs, and circular system
through first-order elimination rate constant, resulting in low accumulation
of NOS in tumor cells.11,12 To enhance the bioavailability,
recently, Madan and co-workers improved sterically stabilized gelatin
micro assemblies of NOS12 and also reported
inhalable nanostructured lipid particles of 9-bromo-NOS for drug delivery
of NOS.13 Sebak et al.14 worked on human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles as an
efficient NOS drug delivery system for the potential use in breast
cancer. More recently, we have shown the effect of NOS on the activity
and structure of HSA.15 In addition to
this, herein, we have tried to find out some new targets for NOS,
and therefore, we have studied the NOS–calf thymus deoxyribose
nucleic acid (ctDNA) interaction. Moreover, to improve the bioavailability
of NOS, we have also shown the encapsulation of NOS in sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) micelles and their intercalation with ctDNA from SDS
micelles. In this study, we have taken SDS (an anionic surfactant)
as a model surfactant which also behaves as a model membrane structure,
where NOS associates into the core of the micelle of the surfactant.
In the past decades, Mitra et al.16 reported
the nature of binding of nile blue with SDS micelles, AOT reverse
micelles, and genomic DNA from salmon sperm. Recently, Mazzoli et
al.17 showed the interaction of new potential
anticancer drugs with DNA in the nonionic micellar system. In this
perspective, in the present study, we have worked on the interaction
of NOS with ctDNA in the presence of anionic micellar assemblies (SDS)
and we have also investigated the interaction of NOS with SDS micelles
using spectroscopy techniques. Scheme 1 shows the systematic representation of the intercalation
of NOS from SDS micelles to ctDNA.

2 Result
and Discussion
2.1 Absorption and Emission
Spectral Studies
2.1.1 Interaction of NOS with
SDS Micelles
The structure of NOS is composed of two aromatic
cyclic rings: a
phthalide ring with S configuration and an isoquinoline ring with
R configuration. These two types of rings are linked through chiral
carbons (Scheme 2).22 They have two stereogenic centers and therefore
consist of four possible stereoisomer carbons.23Scheme 2 shows the structure of NOS.

Scheme 2 Structure of NOS
The absorption and emission spectra of NOS were observed
because
of π–π* transition between these two rings. In
the absorption measurement of NOS, two absorption bands were observed
at 290 and 312 nm in the aqueous buffer solution (Figure S1A). These two absorption bands were practically dependent
on the nature of solvent polarity. NOS showed a single emission peak
in nonpolar solvents and a dual emission peak in the polar solvent.
The emission peaks were found at 402 and 467 nm in aqueous buffer
solution (Figure S1B) and the single peak
was found at 373 nm in dimethyl sulfoxide. It is known from the literature
that NOS is less soluble in water and thus SDS micelles are used to
enhance its solubility and therefore help its delivery to the target
site.19 To facilitate the spectral properties
of NOS in the micellar microenvironment, the absorption and emission
spectra of the molecule were investigated in the anionic micelle environment. Figure 1a shows the absorption
spectral properties of NOS in the aqueous buffer medium at physiological
pH (7.0) with an increasing quantity of anionic surfactant SDS from
precritical micelle concentration (cmc) to post cmc concentration
(0.2–10 mM). Upon increasing the SDS concentration, the intensity
of both absorbance bands was gradually enhanced with a slight blue
shift (290–288 and 312–308 nm) and with a shoulder at
320 nm at the micellar and above micellar concentration range (Figure 1A).The hyperchromic
and hypsochromic shifts in the presence of SDS micelles clearly suggest
increased solubility of NOS in the micellar environment due to the
nonpolar environment of SDS micelles.24 The presence of a shoulder at a higher concentration of SDS suggested
that NOS is present in a vastly different environment and a strong
interaction between SDS micelles and NOS occur in the stern layer. Figure 2 shows the relative
change in the absorbance of NOS at 312 nm against the pre to post
micellar concentrations of SDS. Initially, a slight increase in the
absorbance of NOS shows the involvement of the electrostatic interaction,
while the large hyperchromic shift in the absorbance around cmc suggested
that NOS is entrapped into the hydrophobic core of the micelle which
may be due to the hydrophobic–hydrophobic interaction and at
high concentrations, that is, above micellar concentration, the absorbance
remains constant.5 From Figure 2, it can be seen clearly that
the cmc of SDS in the presence of NOS was decreased and found at around
2.4 mM in the aqueous buffer medium at room temperature. The cmc of
SDS (8.2 mM) may be varied with different external factors such as
pH, salt concentration, temperature, buffer condition, and interaction
with drugs. Makowska et al. reported that different salt concentrations
also change the cmc of SDS.25 Another literature
also showed a decrease in the SDS cmc in the presence of the drug.5 This information suggests that NOS is located
inside the hydrodynamic sphere of micelles and goes to a more nonpolar
environment than its previous state.

in different concentrations
of SDS (0.2–10 mM). (B) Absorption spectra of NOS under different
system.

Figure 2 Plots of variation of relative absorbance and
relative fluorescence
intensity of NOS in the presence of SDS.

Emission spectral analyses were also carried out to understand
the behavior of NOS in SDS micelles. The emission spectrum of NOS
shows very weak intensity around 467 nm with a shoulder at 402 nm,
when exited at 312 nm. We obtained a very interesting result after
adding SDS. Emission spectra of NOS at 467 nm were decreased with
the addition of a lower concentration of SDS (up to 0.8 mM), but at
higher concentrations, the intensity increases gradually. The shoulder
peak at 402 nm turns to a complete specific peak and appears at 394
nm with a blue shift of 8 nm and the peak at 467 nm disappeared around
cmc, that is, 2.4 mM (Figure 3A and 3B). The quenching of NOS emission
by a lower SDS concentration may be caused due to the formation of
NOS and monomer surfactant ion-pair interactions which increasingly
associate to form an aggregated type of structure as micelles.26 At a higher concentration of SDS, the fluorescence
intensity of NOS increases. This is because as the fluorophore of
NOS interacts with SDS at higher concentrations, the structure of
NOS is altered; moreover, the environment around the fluorophore molecule
changes from high-polarity to a low-polarity region. Also, the rotational
movement of the free NOS molecules favors a radiation-less deactivation
of the excited states in aqueous solution.27 However, after binding with SDS molecules, the rotation is hindered
and the deactivation occurs through fluorescence emission, which may
be responsible for the significant increase in the fluorescence intensity
of NOS. A large blue shift also specifies the location of the fluorophore
in the low polar region of micelles, with the hydrophobic moiety of
the probe intruded into the hydrocarbon core region of the micelle.
A similar observation was previously reported in the case of nile
blue and SDS systems.16 These results suggested
that NOS that moves to the micellar environments and microenvironments
around the fluorophore molecule are different compared to that in
the neat buffer. Also, the polarity of the micelles is less compared
to that in the neat buffer and the solubility of NOS increases in
SDS micelles as compared to the aqueous solvent.

of NOS (50 μM) in different concentrations
of SDS (0.2–10 mM). (B) Plots of variation of emission maxima
of NOS in the presence of SDS.

2.1.2 Partition Coefficient Determination
The
spectral changes of NOS in the presence of SDS micelles correspond
to the significant penetration of NOS in the palisade layer of SDS
micelles. To gain an understanding about the mechanism of accessing
the NOS in SDS micelles and the understanding of the partition of
NOS between the micelles and the aqueous phase, we determine the partition
coefficient of aqueous and micellar systems as follows28 1  where Ct, Cm, and Cw are the total molar concentration of the drug and drug concentration
in the micelle and in the aqueous buffer system. [micelle] and [buffer]
represent for molar concentrations of SDS micelles and water, respectively.
The partition coefficient of NOS was calculated by using steady-state
fluorescence data according to the following relationship.29 2  where Kp is denoted
as the partition coefficient of NOS to the micellar phase from the
aqueous medium. I0, It, and I∞ are the fluorescence intensities of NOS in the absence of SDS, with
an intermediate, and at a saturated concentration, respectively. Kp has been calculated from the slope of the
(I∞ – I0)/(It – I0) versus [surfactant]−1 plot
(Figure S2A).The value of Kp was obtained around 5.89 × 104. A higher Kp value showed a greater partitioning of NOS
in SDS micelles.24 Moreover, this significant
partitioning of NOS inside the SDS micelle suggested a strong binding
between NOS and SDS micelles, leading to a stable system. This result
was again confirmed by observing the binding constant between NOS
and SDS. The binding constant was utilized to achieve quantitative
appraisal of the strength of binding between the NOS and SDS assemblies.30 To calculate the binding constant of NOS in
SDS micelles, we have employed modified Benesi–Hildebrand equation
using fluorescence data. The modified Benesi–Hildebrand equation
can be described as follows31 3  where Kb denotes
the binding constant of NOS in the micellar medium. ΔI = It – I0 and ΔImax = I∞ – I0, with I0, It, and I∞, are the fluorescence intensities of NOS in the absence of SDS,
with an intermediate, and at a saturated concentration, respectively.
[M] is the micellar concentration, which is expressed by the following
equation32 4  where [S] represents the concentration
of
SDS and Nagg is the aggregation number
of the SDS micelle. Nagg is determined
by using the standard fluorescence quenching method.33 The value of Nagg was calculated
to be 281 and the consequent plot is shown in Figure S3. The value of Kb was
calculated from the slope of the (I∞ – I0)/(It – I0)
versus [M]−1 plot (Figure S2B). The value of Kb was obtained around
1.78 × 102 M–1. The free-energy
change ΔG was also calculated by using the
following relationship 5  where Kb is the
binding constant. The observed negative value of ΔG (−12.84 kJ mol–1) suggested that the binding
process was spontaneous and energetically favorable.

2.1.3 Intercalation of ctDNA with NOS
The interactions of
NOS with ctDNA have been studied separately. Figure 4 shows absorption
(312 nm) and emissions spectra (467 nm) of NOS in aqueous buffer solution
by adding increasing concentrations of ctDNA (2.46–47.7 μM).
The absorption spectra clearly demonstrated that with the addition
of ctDNA, the absorbance spectra of NOS decreased with a slight red
shift (Figure 4A) of
4 nm, suggesting NOS interaction with ctDNA. Generally, hypochromism
and red shifts refer to the intercalative binding mode that represents
strong stacking interaction between the aromatic ring of the drug
and the base pairs of ctDNA.34 This result
suggested that strong intercalation occurred between NOS and base
pairs of ctDNA.

Figure 4 (A) Absorption spectra of NOS (50 μM) in different
concentrations
of DNA (2.46–47.7 μM). (B) Emission spectra of NOS (50
μM) in different concentrations of DNA (2.46–47.7 μM).

In the emission spectral studies, when we added
different concentrations
of ctDNA, the fluorescence intensity of NOS gradually decreased with
a minute blue shift approximately 5 nm. As shown in Figure 4B, the decrease in fluorescence
intensity indicates the occurrence of an intercalative binding mode
between NOS and the base pair of ctDNA. Sayed et al. also reported
a similar type of results for acridine orange binding with ctDNA.18 The modified Benesi–Hildebrand equation
(eq 3) is again utilized
to calculate the binding constant between NOS and ctDNA interaction,
where [M] denotes the ctDNA concentration. Figure S4A shows the double reciprocal plot for the NOS–ctDNA
binding. The value (Kb) was found to be
1.29 × 105 M–1 at room temperature.
It has been reported that the binding constants with a higher order
(∼104 to 105 M–1) owing
to the intercalative binding mode. Zhang et al. has reported a similar
order (5 × 104) of binding constant for intercalation
between ferulic acid and ctDNA.35 These
results again confirmed that NOS intercalation between the base pairs
of ctDNA.

To confirm the intercalative binding mode further,
we carried out
the ethidium bromide (EB) fluorescence displacement experiment. EB
intercalates to the base pair of DNA and emits an intense fluorescence.36 Upon addition of NOS in the EB–ctDNA
system, the fluorescence intensity of the EB–ctDNA system decreased
(Figure S5). This decrease in the fluorescence
intensity of the EB–ctDNA complex indicates that NOS displaced
EB molecules and binds in the intercalative mode to ctDNA.37 The value of free energy change (ΔG = −29.17 kJ M–1) for NOS–ctDNA
binding indicates that the binding process is spontaneous. From the
result, it is observed that NOS exhibits a strong binding with both
the SDS micelle and ctDNA independently; however, the magnitude of
binding constant is higher in ctDNA compared to the SDS micellar system.
These comparative binding results suggested that if ctDNA is added
to the micelle-bound NOS system, NOS might prefer release from the
micelle environment and binds to the ctDNA. In this prespective, we
have demonstrated this assumption to be true using different spectroscopic
techniques in the forthcoming sections.

2.1.4 Interaction
of ctDNA with the Micelle-Loaded
NOS
The interaction and binding mechanism of NOS with SDS
micelles and ctDNA has already been discussed. Now, we explore the
interaction of SDS-loaded NOS with ctDNA and investigate the intercalation
of NOS with ctDNA from SDS micelles. As we add ctDNA to micelle-bound
NOS, the absorbance spectra of NOS decreased with the slight red shift
of 7 nm from 308 to 315 nm with ctDNA. The spectral modulation in Figure 5A suggested that
upon addition of ctDNA, NOS experiences a different environment than
that in SDS micelles (Figure 4A). The position of the absorption maximum of NOS was observed
previously at 315 nm in the ctDNA medium. From Figure 1B, the parallel spectral behavior of NOS
was observed with ct DNA and in the composite medium (SDS micelle
+ ctDNA), suggesting that NOS binds with ctDNA in the SDS micelle.
Therefore, the absorption spectra result exposes that NOS prefers
to intercalate with ctDNA in the composite medium (SDS micelle + ctDNA).

Figure 5 (A) Absorption
spectra of SDS (10 mM)-loaded NOS (50 μM)
in different concentrations of DNA (2.46–47.7 μM). (B)
Emission spectra of SDS-loaded NOS (50 μM:10 mM) in different
concentrations of DNA.

Emission spectral analyses
were done to confirm the transfer of
NOS from SDS micelles to the DNA environment. As shown in Figure 5B, it can be seen
clearly that with increasing concentrations of ctDNA in micelle-loaded
NOS, the emission intensity of micelle-loaded NOS decreases significantly.
The quenching of NOS spectra in the composite medium (micelle + ctDNA)
nearly corresponds with that of the NOS in the ctDNA medium alone
(Figure 4B). Thus,
the emission spectra of micelle-loaded NOS upon addition of ctDNA
indicate that in the presence of ctDNA, NOS has moved from the SDS
micelle to the ctDNA medium. The binding constant of micelle-loaded
NOS and ctDNA was calculated using the modified Benesi–Hildebrand
equation (eq 3). Figure S4B shows the double log plot for the
micelle-loaded NOS–ctDNA binding. The calculated binding constant
(Kb) is 3.18 × 104 M–1 at room temperature (298 K). From Table 1, it can be seen clearly that
the binding constant of NOS in the composite medium is practically
equivalent to the NOS–ctDNA system and comparatively much higher
than that of the NOS–SDS system, that is, 1.78 × 102 M–1. Ghosh et al. reported a similar result
with a cationic phenazinium dye in the lipid environment.38 This result suggested that the repositioning
of NOS from the SDS micelle to ctDNA is reorganized by the contemplation
of a higher binding affinity of NOS toward ctDNA in comparison to
the micelle medium, leading to competitive binding.

2.2 Probe
Location Studies
For the probe
location study, that is, to compare the location of the probe in the
micelle and composite medium, fluorescence quenching with KI and fluorescent
anisotropy studies were employed. Both studies provide the information
about membrane fluidity, drug insertion, and drug location into the
micelle as well as the biomolecule.28

2.2.1 Fluorescence Quenching Study with Potassium
Iodide (KI)
To explore the binding location of NOS within
the SDS micelle and composite medium, we employed fluorescence quenching
with potassium iodide (KI) as a quencher. The fluorescence quenching
study gives valuable information regarding the accessibility of the
entrapped fluorophore toward the quencher and therefore it is useful
in the assessment of the location of the fluorophore in different
micro heterogeneous environments.5 Fluorescence
quenching is a process in which reduction of emission intensity of
a fluorophore occurs by a quencher.39−42 The quenching rate constants
of NOS with the addition of a quencher (KI) for different systems
(free NOS, NOS–SDS, NOS–ctDNA, and NOS–SDS–ctDNA)
have been calculated by the Stern–Volmer equation 6  where KSV is the
Stern–Volmer quenching constant, I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities in the absence
and presence of quencher (KI), respectively, and [Q] is the molar
concentration of the quencher. The higher the magnitude of KSV, the better the quenching process, which
indicates a greater degree of exposure of the fluorophore to the quencher.5Figure 6 shows the Stern–Volmer plots for KI quenching of NOS
in different mediums such as aqueous buffer, ctDNA, and SDS micelles
and in the composite medium. The calculated value of KSV in different systems is shown in Table 2. From Figure 6 and Table 2, the fluorescence quenching of NOS in the SDS micelle is
significantly lower than that in the aqueous buffer solution. A lower KSV value of NOS in the SDS micelle indicates
that NOS has occupied the hydrophobic core of the SDS micelle compared
to the hydrophilic environment outside the micelle. The degree of
exposure of the fluorophore toward the quencher diminishes in SDS
micelles because the organized assemblies of SDS micelles were unreachable
by the water-soluble quencher, which leads to a lower value of KSV. However, the values of KSV are varied in different systems. For the NOS–ctDNA
system, the KSV value was also observed
lesser in compression to free NOS but higher than that of NOS in the
SDS micelle (Table 2). This indicates that NOS intercalates with ctDNA and is thus less
accessible to the quencher. Moreover, the KSV value of NOS (in SDS micellar medium) with ctDNA was observed very
close to the KSV value of NOS–ctDNA,
which again suggested that NOS was released from the hydrophobic core
of the micelle and favored the intercalation with ctDNA.28

KI ions in
different systems.

2.2.2 Steady-State Fluorescence Anisotropy
The steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy study is a powerful tool
in the biophysical research that provides the location of the fluorophore
in different bio or biomimetic microheterogeneous environments such
as protein, DNA, and micelle lipids.30 When
fluorescence probes are excited in polarized light, the emission from
the probe is polarized. This degree of polarization of the emission
is defined as anisotropy (r) which provides valuable
information about the surrounding environments of the fluorophores.27,43 We obtained information about the size, shape, and segmental flexibility
of a molecule affecting different moieties using fluorescence anisotropy.
An increase in fluorescence anisotropy quantifies the rigidity of
the environment surrounding the fluorophore, which is used as an indicator
of the extent of rigidity imposed on the fluorophore in different
micro heterogeneous mediums.19,44

In addition to
the information provided by fluorescence quenching data, fluorescence
anisotropy (r) values of NOS have been measured in
different environments to judge its location in these mediums. Figure 7 shows the dissimilarity
in the fluorescence anisotropy values of NOS in SDS micelles, ctDNA,
and the composite medium, and the significant fluorescence anisotropy
values are compiled in Table 3. From Figure 7, fluorescence anisotropy of NOS in the SDS micelle and ctDNA environments
is considerably higher in comparison to an aqueous buffer medium (Table 3). Also, there is
a gradual increase in the anisotropy value of NOS with increasing
concentrations of SDS (Figure 7). These data show the imposition of some sort of rotational
restriction of NOS upon binding with both the systems as the monomers
of SDS are arranged more orderly. Above the cmc of SDS, the anisotropy
reached a maximum and constant further. This indicates that the NOS
molecule is entrapped inside the SDS micelles. Higher fluorescence
anisotropy reflects the gradual increase in rigidity of the drug inside
the micelle which confirms that NOS moves to a more restricted region,
that is, core of the micelle. This result was in agreement with a
large blue shift in the fluorescence spectra of NOS upon the addition
of SDS (Figure 3A).44 In the NOS–ctDNA system, the anisotropy
value increases from the value obtained in the aqueous buffer, signifying
imposition of the motional restriction on NOS upon binding with ctDNA
and a higher anisotropy value confirmed the intercalative mode of
binding between NOS and ctDNA. When ctDNA is added in micelle-loaded
NOS, the anisotropy value of NOS deceases gradually and reach 0.059
at a high ctDNA concentration (50 μM), which suggested that
the environment of NOS is changed. This anisotropy value is very close
to the observed NOS–ctDNA system (Table 3). The steady-state fluorescence anisotropy
result again confirmed that NOS occurs in similar motional restrictions
from its surrounding moiety in DNA as well as the composite medium
and NOS favor the intercalation with ctDNA from SDS micelles (see Table 4).44

2.3 Time-Resolved
Fluorescence Decay
Time-resolved fluorescence decay is a
very sensitive tool for studying
the nature of hydration as well as the relaxation dynamics of the
drug in aqueous and micellar environments and also the excited state
interactions of the probe.39,45−47 This gives the information about the residence of the probe within
different micro heterogeneous mediums. Herein, we observe the fluorescence
lifetime of NOS in different environments to find out its replacement
from micelles to the ctDNA in the composite medium. The fluorescence
lifetime of NOS in SDS, ctDNA, and composite medium is shown in Figure 8 at an excitation
wavelength 312 nm and the corresponding deconvoluted data are tabulated
in Tables S1–S3. It can be seen
from Table S1, the fluorescence lifetime
of NOS (in buffer) was fitted by the biexponential function consisting
shorter τ1 (1.79 ns) and longer τ2 (15.95 ns) component. This indicates the residence of the probe
in a single environment.19 In micelles,
ctDNA, and composite medium, NOS is fitted by a triexponential function
comprising a small relative population of long components τ3, which represents the multiple locations of the probe environment
differing in polarity.27,44 From Table S1 (Figure 8A), the average fluorescence lifetimes of NOS were increased significantly
with the increasing concentrations of SDS, suggesting the incorporation
of NOS into SDS micelles. Also, Table S1 shows drastical increase in the longer component, τ2 (15.79–19.58 ns). This enhancement of lifetimes signifies
change in the environment of NOS aqueous to micellar environment.
However, Figure 9A
clearly shows that the τavg value from 0.2 to 1.6
mM concentration range of SDS is decreased, enhanced till 6.4 mM and
then becomes constant. This result again confirmed our previous finding
that NOS resides in the hydrophobic core of the micelle. In the case
of NOS–ctDNA interaction, there is a slight increase in τavg (15.79–16.25 ns). Change in lifetime suggested the
binding of NOS to ctDNA (Figure 8B, Table S2). When we added
ctDNA in micelle-bound NOS, the decay profile of NOS was observed
to be almost similar to that in ctDNA environment (Figure 8C, Table S3). Figure 8D shows the change of decay patterns of NOS in different environments
(buffer, micelle, ctDNA, and composite medium). A comparative study
of the τavg value of NOS in the ctDNA system and
NOS in the composite medium showed the intercalation of NOS with ctDNA
from SDS micelles, as in the composite medium, the τavg value was decreased on increasing the concentration of ctDNA and
reach an equivalent τavg value to that of the NOS–ctDNA
system (Figure 9B). Figures 8D and 9B show clearly that the lifetime of NOS in the composite medium
agrees well with only the ctDNA medium, which suggested the transfer
of NOS from SDS micelles to ctDNA.

2.4 Time-Resolved
Anisotropy
Time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy is also a very useful technique to determine
the microenvironment and location of the probe in a multi-component
environment. It gives an idea about structural and dynamical information
of the fluorophore in an organized medium.48,49 Fluorescence decay anisotropy is directly associated with the reorientation
dynamics of the excited fluorophore, and thus it is a suitable tool
for the investigation of molecular dynamics and rotational relaxation
and thereby for the structural information of fluorophore.50 To obtain the information about the microenvironment
around the NOS in different mediums (SDS micelle, ctDNA, and composite
medium), the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of NOS was
performed. Figure 10 shows the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay of NOS in
different mediums. In the aqueous medium (buffer), the anisotropy
decay of NOS is found to be single-exponential with a lifetime component
of 0.499 ns. In the presence of SDS micelles, the anisotropy decay
is also fitted as single-exponential, but the rotational relaxation
decay time increases about 0.744 ns, which indicates that the environment
of NOS was changed. The significantly enhancement in rotational relaxation
decay time of NOS shows the location of the drug in a motionally constrained
environment (Figure 10A). In the presence of ctDNA, the anisotropy decay of NOS is fitted
biexponential with a short component and as a lower component. This
interaction shows the “dip-and rise” kind of an anisotropy
decay pattern, which indicates the presence of two or more populations,
among which one has a short fluorescence lifetime with a fast rotational
correlation time and another is a slower component.27,51 Generally, this type of an anisotropy decay profile has been observed
for fluorophores withbiomolecules such as protein and DNA. In which
the shorter correlation time component is credited through the free
fluorophore (i.e., NOS in buffer) and the slower component is due
to the fluorophores that bind with the biomolecule.27,49,52,53 When we performed
time-resolved anisotropy decay of NOS in the composite medium, we
obtained again biexponential function of rotational correlation time
with the shorter and slower components. The pattern of the anisotropy
decay profile of NOS was observed to be almost similar to that in
the ctDNA environment (Figure 10B), which strongly support our previous finding, that
is, NOS is released from the SDS micelle and binds with ctDNA in the
composite medium.

and NOS–SDS–DNA.

2.5 Dynamic Light Scattering
To explore
the interaction of NOS with ctDNA and the relation of NOS from SDS
micelles to ctDNA in the composite medium, we have performed dynamic
light scattering (DLS) as it is a well-known technique that provides
valuable information about the dimension of supramolecular assemblies
and biomolecules.21,49Figure S6 shows the intensity distribution of DLS profiles of ctDNA, SDS micelles,
ctDNA–SDS, ctDNA–NOS, NOS–SDS, and NOS–SDS–ctDNA
interaction. The DLS peak of NOS was not observed due to its smaller
size. DLS spectra of SDS micelles and SDS micelle bound NOS reveal
a quite monomodal distribution with an average diameter of 6.12 and
7.41 nm, respectively (Figure S6A,B). The
NOS–SDS medium shows much broadened distribution with a higher
diameter relative to the SDS micelle, which indicates the incorporation
of NOS to SDS micelles.29 The DLS profile
of native ctDNA shows two peaks (Figure S6C), where the second larger peak with hydrodynamic diameters of 87.66
nm corresponds to the hydrodynamic diameter of native ctDNA.54 In the ctDNA–SDS system, two peaks were
observed with hydrodynamic diameters of 6.12 and 111.5 nm (Figure S6D), wherein the first peak corresponds
to the SDS micelle and the second peak corresponds to ctDNA. As we
added NOS in the ctDNA medium, a large peak at 138.4 nm was observed
(Figure S6E). A slightly enhanced hydrodynamic
radius with a small shift toward a higher dimension indicates NOS
intercalation with ctDNA which results in an incremental increase
in the diameter of NOS. In the composite medium, we observed multiple
peaks, which represents more than one type molecule found in medium29 (Figure S6F). From Figure S6F, the first peak corresponds to free
micelles, the second peak for SDS bound NOS, and the third large peak
is due to the intercalated ctDNA with NOS. The DLS result again confirms
our observation by other techniques that in the composite medium NOS
is released from the SDS micelle and intercalated with ctDNA.

2.6 Effect of SDS Micelles on the Structure of
ctDNA
It is very crucial to determine the effect of SDS micelles
on the ctDNA structure; hence we observe the structural aspect of
ctDNA using CD analysis below and above the cmc of SDS. Figure 11A shows the CD
spectra of ctDNA with two concentration of SDS, one is below cmc (4
mM) and another is above cmc (10 mM). The CD spectrum of ctDNA shows
a two characteristic peaks attributed to the right-handed helicity:
a positive peak at ∼275 nm and a negative peak at ∼245
nm.55 There is no significant change in
the CD spectrum of ctDNA observed at these concentrations of SDS,
which suggested that the SDS micelle does not perturb the structure
of ctDNA. Patra et al. also reported that SDS micelles do not give
the structure effect on ctDNA.56 This result
supported that we can use SDS micellar systems as the carrier of drugs
for their safe delivery to the target, DNA.

Figure 11 (A)CD spectra of ctDNA
(100 μM) in the presence of different
concentrations of SDS. (B)CD spectra of ctDNA (100 μM) in the
presence of NOS (50 μM) and SDS micelle-loaded NOS.

Further, we analyzed the CD spectrum of NOS in different
environments
to determine the relocation of NOS from SDS micelle to ctDNA in the
composite medium. NOS has a chiral atom, and so it exhibits its own
CD spectrum with two negative peaks at 218 and 238 nm (Figure S7). As we introduced SDS to the NOS,
the peak at 218 nm disappeared, which indicated that SDS induces structural
changes in NOS which may be due to the hydrophobic environment created
by SDS micelles and NOS resides in the hydrophobic core of the SDS
micelle (Figure S7). Further upon addition
of NOS in ctDNA, it induces a strong structural change in ctDNA as
the intensity of both the peaks were changed largely (Figure 11B). The strong change in both
the peaks is attributed to the imposed asymmetry on the probe because
of its intercalation within the DNA base pairs. Induced CD spectra
of DNA binders originate because of the coupling of the electric transition
dipoles of the binder molecule and DNA bases within the asymmetric
DNA environment.57 In the SDS micellar
medium, we observed similar results as those observed for the NOS–ctDNA
interaction. The structural peak of ctDNA changes in the composite
medium, which indicates the relocation of NOS from SDS micelles to
ctDNA and intercalate to ctDNA (Figure 11B). Therefore, the result suggested that
in the presence of ctDNA, NOS binds to ctDNA and releases from the
micelle.

2.7 Molecular Docking Study
We utilized
the molecular docking technique to determine the binding location
of a small molecule within the microheterogeneous assembly as well
as the biomolecule.58−60 Herein, we have carried out molecular docking technique
through AutoDock software to assess the probable location and binding
mode of NOS in SDS micelles and ctDNA. We performed 100 docking run
of NOS with SDS micelles built in a micelle maker server and DNA duplex
of sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 dodecamer (PDB ID: 1BNA), and the most energetically
favorable conformation was utilized for the docking analysis. NOS
shows strong binding with both SDS micelles (−11.02 kcal) and
ctDNA (−7.0 kcal), which is comparable to our experimental
result. As shown clearly in Figure 12A, NOS lies between the base pairs of ctDNA in the
binding site of the G–C region, which suggests that the drugs
bind to ctDNA through intercalative binding. Figure 12B shows that NOS binds through three base
pairs G–C, C–G, and A–T of ctDNA with two hydrogen
bonds between NOS and G4, A5 residue of the ctDNA. However, Figure 12C shows binding
between NOS and SDS micelles, which clearly indicates that NOS resides
in the core of the micelle through hydrophobic interactions. The molecular
docking results suggested the binding of NOS with SDS micelles and
ctDNA, which shows a mutual coherence between computational and spectroscopic
techniques.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have explored
the intercalation of an anticancer
drug, NOS, to ctDNA through an anionic SDS micelle by using different
spectroscopy techniques such as absorption, steady-state, time-resolved
fluorescence, CD spectroscopy and DLS measurements. The binding affinities
of NOS–SDS micelles and NOS–ctDNA are 1.78 × 102 and 1.29 × 105 M–1, respectively.
Higher binding constant signify the relocation of NOS from SDS micelles
to ctDNA. The locations of NOS in different environments were determined
by fluorescence quenching and steady-state fluorescence anisotropy,
which confirms the transfer of NOS. Time-resolved fluorescence, time
resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and CD studies substantiate that
in the composite medium, NOS remains intercalated within the DNA base
pairs and are released from SDS micelles. Additionally, our molecular
docking results again confirmed that NOS resides into the core of
the micelle.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
ct-DNA, NOS (98%), SDS,
and phosphate salts (sodium monophosphate and biphosphate) were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. The stock solution of ctDNA was prepared by dissolving
in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0) and stored in −20 °C,
as described in the literature.18 The ctDNA
concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using extinction
coefficients (ε) 6600 M–1 cm–1 at 260 nm and the purity of ctDNA was confirmed by observing absorbance
ratio (A260 nm/A280 nm) which is observed between the range of 1.8–1.9.19 NOS solution was prepared in the phosphate buffer.
The freshly prepared micellar solution of SDS was utilized after confirming
its cmc by using a Langmuir tensiometer (Kibron, Helsinki, Finland).
The cmc of SDS in water at room temperature was observed at 8.2 mM,
which is matches well with reported values.5 Ultrapure water was used throughout the experiments obtained from
a Millipore water purification system. The buffer solution was filtered
through Millipore filters of 0.22 μm pore size. All other reagents
were of analytical reagent grade and used without further purification.

4.2 Instrumentation
An Analytik Jena
Specord-210 spectrophotometer and a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer
(Varian, USA) were used to measure the absorption and emission spectra.
The steady-state anisotropy (r) was measured on the
same spectrofluorometer equipped with a manual monopolarizer by quantifying
the fluorescence intensities with the excitation polarizer oriented
vertically and the emission polarizer oriented vertically (IVV) and horizontally (IVH), respectively, using following equation 7  

The grating factor
(G) is calculated by the following relation 8  

The lifetime
decay was observed on a time-correlated single-photon
counting spectrometer (Horiba, Jobin Yvon, IBH Ltd., Glasgow, UK).
Moreover, the time resolved fluorescence anisotropy decays were also
carried out with the same instrument using a motorized polarizer.
The emission intensity was collected at parallel (I||) and perpendicular (I⊥) polarization decay with a certain peak difference. The same software
was utilized for the analysis of the anisotropy data. The time-resolved
anisotropy decay function r(t) was
described as the following relation 9  where r(t) represents the rotational relaxation correlation function. I||(t) and I⊥(t) are fluorescence decay for
parallel and perpendicular polarization, respectively. G is the grating factor, which is described by eq 4 10  

For size measurements, the DLS study was done on Malvern Zetasizer
Nano ZS90. The conformational changes in ctDNA structure were observed
with a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter attached with a temperature controlling
unit for uniform temperature. The molecular docking study was also
carried out on Autodock 4.2 software. Further details of methodology
has been described in our earlier publication15,20,21 and in the Supporting Information. For NOS–ctDNA binding, we have used a fixed
concentration of NOS (50 μM) with varying concentrations of
ctDNA (2.46–47.7 μM). Also, for the NOS–SDS micellar
interaction, fix concentration of NOS (50 μM) and different
concentrations of SDS (0.2–10 mM) below and above cmc were
utilized. For the NOS–SDS–ctDNA system, fix concentrations
of NOS and SDS complex (50 μM:10 mM) and different concentrations
of ctDNA (2.46–47.7 μM) were utilized.
