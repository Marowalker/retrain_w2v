The expression of animal digestive
enzymes reflects important dietary
adaptations. The pangolin, also known as scaly anteater, is a specialized
myrmecophage that consumes mainly ants and termites, but its digestive
enzymes have not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this study,
we used shotgun proteomic analysis to examine the protein components
of the saliva and intestinal juice of a Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) that died shortly after being rescued.
The intestinal juice contained greater variety of digestive enzymes,
including α-amylase, maltase-glucoamylase, α,α-trehalase,
sucrase-isomaltase, pepsin A, trypsin, pancreatic endopeptidase E,
carboxypeptidase A1, carboxypeptidase B, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4, and
pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase. The digestive enzymes identified
in the saliva were maltase-glucoamylase and trypsin, and chitinase
which was also found in the intestinal juice. Compared with other
animals, the Sunda pangolin has less intestinal protease diversity
and lacks key digestive enzymes, such as chymotrypsin and pancreatic
elastase. The expression profile of the digestive enzymes of the Sunda
pangolin reveals animal’s adaptation to a diet consisting mainly
of ants and termites. Our results will facilitate the preparation
of artificial food for rescued pangolins and for those in captivity
for conservation breeding efforts.

==== Body
Introduction
The extant mammals,
under the powerful selective pressure exerted
by the need for successful acquisition of food resources, have evolved
a wide variety of dietary niches, ranging from broadly generalized
to highly specialized.1 However, food choices
are constrained by the capability of an animal’s digestive
system to extract nutrients effectively.2 The mammalian digestive system has evolved to include several anatomical
structures, a complex microbial flora,3 and digestive enzymes adapted to feeding habits.4,5

Pangolins are specialized myrmecophagous mammals that feed mainly
on ants and termites6−12 and have a unique external armor of overlapping scales; hence, they
are often called scaly anteaters. Like some other myrmecophagous mammals,
such as anteaters, pangolins have powerful front claws that allow
them to dig into ant and termite nests. They also have a pointed snout,
toothless mouth, and long, flexible, slimy tongue adapted to preying
on ants and termites.13,14 In addition to adaptation for
predation, the efficient extraction of nutrients from food is another
important challenge for pangolins. The polysaccharide chitin, a major
exoskeleton component, makes up 5–20% of the dry weight of
ants and termites;15 thus, most of the
protein value of ants and termites is locked in the exoskeleton,16 and chitin is recalcitrant to digestion. How
pangolins get energy and nutrients efficiently from ants and termites
is not well understood. There is little research on the pangolin digestive
system; published studies have focused on its morphology and structure.
The inner gastric surface of the Sunda pangolin (Manis
javanica) has a thick layer of keratinized epithelial
cells.17 Like Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), the gastric fundus of Sunda
pangolins has many mucosal folds to expand the gastric surface area,17−19 and the pylorus has hard spines called “pyloric teeth”,17,19 which are similar to the stomachs of other ant-eating animals, such
as Indian pangolins (Manis crassicaudata),20 grasshopper mouse (Onychomys torridus),21 armadillo, and echidna22 and is thought
to be suitable for its ant-eating habit and toothless characteristics.17,22,23 However, no horny ridges are
found in the stomachs of the giant pangolin (Smutsia
gigantea), long-tailed pangolin (Phataginus
tetradactyla), or tree pangolin (Phataginus
tricuspis), and this is thought to be a possible difference
between Asian and African pangolins.19 Neither
the Chinese pangolin nor the Sunda pangolin has a caecum, and there
is no obvious boundary between the large and small intestines.24 The small intestine of Chinese pangolin is about
nine times its body length, longer than that of a carnivore, and it
is thought to take longer time to digest ants and termites.24

Although digestive enzymes and gut microbes
play an important role
in animal digestion, there is only one report on the digestive enzymes
and gut microbes of pangolins. The intestinal microbial community
of the Sunda pangolin is similar to that of herbivores but different
from that of anteaters and other ant-eating animals.25 It does not conform to the theory that gut microbiomes
evolved convergently in the mammals sharing the same feeding habits.26 Another paper verified the presence of chitinase
in the stomach of the Sunda pangolin.27 However, there are no reports about the characteristics of digestive
enzyme expression in saliva and small intestine. The small intestine,
in particular, is the most important site for food digestion. What
is more, the pangolins have a higher incidence of gastrointestinal
diseases in captivity, and it is speculated to be related to the lack
of understanding of pangolins’ digestive physiology, and the
artificial food provided is not well digested and absorbed. Hence,
we hypothesize that pangolin has formed specialized digestive physiology,
which lacks the expression of some proteases, but expresses more certain
digestive enzymes, such as chitinase, to adapt to the specialized
ant-eating habits.

In recent years, the development of proteomics
has allowed investigation
of the expression profiles of proteins in specific tissues or cells,
and thus determination of the cellular metabolic potential.28,29 The use of proteomics for the large-scale detection of proteins
in animal digestive juices can provide insight into animal digestive
physiology in an evolutionary environment.30 Digestive enzymes and variation in the digestive tract play key
roles in the decomposition of large food molecules into small absorbable
compounds and are extremely important in dietary adaptation. Therefore,
to understand the digestive function of the Sunda pangolin, this study
used shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
for the first time to detect the variety and relative abundance of
digestive enzymes in saliva and intestinal juice of the Sunda pangolin
and to construct an expression profile. Our results provide insight
into the mechanisms underlying the digestive adaptation of pangolins
and a basis for the selection of artificial food ingredients in the
ex situ conservation of these animals.

Results
Identification
of Proteins in the Saliva and Intestinal Juice
of the Sunda Pangolin
In the tested Sunda pangolin, shotgun
LC–MS/MS and MaxQuant software analysis revealed significant
differences in the variety of proteins in the two digestive fluids,
with 727 distinct proteins in saliva and 2968 in the intestinal juice
(Table 1). There were
296 and 1030 proteins with ≥2 unique peptides, respectively
(Table 1). Of these
identified proteins, 91 and 25 proteins could not be quantified. Myoglobin,
keratin, and actin were the most abundant proteins in saliva and intestinal
juice, with intensity-based absolute protein quantification (iBAQ)
values of 7 351 000 000 and 9 135 400 000,
respectively.

Fewer specific proteins were found in saliva (n = 478) than in intestinal juice (n =
2719), whereas
the two digestive juices had 249 proteins in common (Figure 1).

and unique proteins among the total
proteins in the saliva and intestinal juice of the Sunda pangolin

Functional Predictions
for the Proteins Identified in Saliva
and Intestinal Juice
Protein functional annotation provides
insight into the physiological function of a sample. Gene ontology
(GO) annotation was performed for 719 and 2957 proteins in saliva
and intestinal juice of Sunda pangolin HS-04, respectively, of which
8 and 11, respectively, could not be matched because of a lack of
annotation. According to prediction analyses, most of the proteins
in the two digestive juices were involved in binding and catalytic
activity in the molecular function: 383 and 300 proteins in saliva
(Figure 2b) and 1513
and 1295 proteins in intestinal juice (Figure 2e). Further analysis assigned most of the
proteins from the two digestive fluids to cellular and metabolic processes
in the biological process and to cell and cell parts in cellular components
(Figure 2).

Digestive Enzyme Expression Analysis
In the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, 316 and 356
pathways were enriched in saliva and intestinal juice of Sunda pangolin
HS-04, respectively (Tables S1 and S2).
In accordance with the purpose of this study, we focused only on the
key pathways associated with digestion and absorption. These five
pathways were related to carbohydrate digestion and absorption, protein
digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, vitamin digestion
and absorption, and mineral absorption. All of these pathways were
annotated in the intestinal juices, whereas the vitamin digestion
and absorption pathway was not annotated in saliva.

The number
of varieties of proteins related to digestion and absorption pathways
enriched in saliva and intestinal juice is shown in Figure 3. Among the two digestive fluids
of this pangolin, the larger variety of proteins involved in the five
digestion and absorption pathways was annotated in intestinal juice,
in which the number of types of annotated digestive enzymes was also
greater and included α-amylase, maltase-glucoamylase, α,α-trehalase,
sucrase-isomaltase, pepsin A, trypsin, pancreatic endopeptidase E,
carboxypeptidase A1, carboxypeptidase B, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2, neprilysin, pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase, secretory
phospholipase A2, and pancreatic lipase-related protein 1 (Table 2). Only two digestive
enzymes, maltase-glucoamylase and trypsin, were annotated in the saliva
of the pangolin.

We also considered
the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism
pathway as it is related to chitin degradation and the pangolin diet
contains a considerable amount of chitin. This pathway was enriched
in two digestive juices of this tested pangolin, with the larger variety
of related proteins present in the intestinal juice (Figure 3, Table S2). In addition to the chitinolytic enzyme chitinase and hexosaminidase
(Table 2), these proteins
included multiple enzymes associated with amino sugar metabolism (Figure 4). In the saliva,
chitinase and several other enzymes associated with amino sugar metabolism,
such as glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase, were detected (Table 3 and Figure 5). The iBAQ values for these
important digestive enzymes identified in the saliva and intestinal
juice ranged from 106 to 109 (Figure 6).

Discussion
The enzymes in the digestive
system of animals are one of the key
factors related to their digestive function. Pangolin is a mammal
with specialized food, that is, ants and termites. In this study,
we speculated that the expression of digestive enzymes in pangolin’s
digestive system had formed an adaptation to its specialized food
and analyzed the types of digestive enzymes in saliva and intestinal
fluid of a Sunda pangolin. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect
the types of digestive enzymes in gastric fluid because of problems
in sample preservation. The higher diversity of proteins and digestive
enzymes in the Sunda pangolin was found in intestinal juice than saliva.
Trypsin was detected in two digestive fluids and was the most abundant
digestive enzyme (Figure 6). In addition to protein digestion, trypsin plays a central
role in regulating the activities of other digestive enzymes.31 This may explain why trypsin was present in
the saliva of the pangolin and in its small intestine.

A diet
consisting of insects, especially ants and termites, contains
considerable amounts of the protein value and other nutrients locked
in chitin.16 Although chitin is as an excellent
source of carbon, energy, and nitrogen, it must first be broken down
by chitinase into n-acetylglucosamine residues that
can be transported into the cell.32 In
this study, it was found that chitinase was expressed in the saliva
and intestinal juice of Sunda pangolin HS-04, and hexosaminidase was
also expressed in the intestinal juice. A diet rich in certain nutrients
exerts selective pressure on the evolution of genes encoding more
specific digestive enzymes in different parts of the digestive system.4,5 Chitinase is commonly found in the stomachs of mammals as acidic
mammalian chitinase.15,33−35 For better
digestion of chitin in food, in addition to the stomach, chitinase
is found in the intestines and saliva of some other insect-eating
animals, such as bats and rodents.32,34 It was also
detected in the saliva and intestinal juice of the Sunda pangolin,
in amounts similar to those of most other digestive enzymes (Figure 6). This implies the
existence of strong evolutionary pressure for Sunda pangolins to digest
chitin effectively. The expression of chitinase in the mouth, stomach,
and small intestine allows efficient nutrient extraction. Moreover,
compared to those of carnivores, pangolins have longer intestinal
tracts,24 which may allow chitinase more
time for chitin digestion in the intestine. Together with the chitinase
expressed in its saliva and stomach,27 these
constitute an adaptation that allows the utilization of ants and termites
as primary food sources.

The wide variety of proteins annotated
in the amino sugar and nucleotide
sugar metabolism pathway in the tested pangolin intestinal juice indicates
not only an evolutionary adaptation for chitin digestion but also
the importance of chitin in the pangolin diet. The role of chitin
in the dietary nutrition of pangolins and giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) was initially thought to
be as a source of dietary fiber.24,36 However, the
annotation of other enzymes involved in amino sugar and nucleotide
sugar metabolism in the pangolin intestinal tract (besides chitinase
and hexosaminidase; Figure 4) suggests that chitin is broken down into n-acetylglucosamine monomers, which are then converted to glucose
and nucleotide sugars. Accordingly, chitin likely provides substantial
nutrients for pangolins.

There is low protease diversity in
the Sunda pangolin intestine,
which lacks some protein digestive enzymes. Proteins are eventually
digested by proteases into amino acids, which provide key nutrients
for growth, development, repair, energy, and many other bodily functions.
The significant overlap in functional protease subtypes (i.e., the
multiple parallel and redundant systems) in the animal digestive tract
ensures an adequate supply of all the key amino acids despite a diverse
and inconsistent diet.31 However, we found
that several common intestinal proteases, such as chymotrypsin B1,
chymotrypsin, chymotrypsin-like protease, pancreatic elastase 2 (EC
3.4.21.71), carboxypeptidase A2 (EC 3.4.17.15), and carboxypeptidase
B2 (EC 3.4.17.20), were missing from the protein digestive system
of Sunda pangolin HS-04. This is also the case in several primates,
such as platyrrhine monkeys, which rely primarily on insect protein
and thus have less pepsin diversity than do primates that depend on
foliage protein.37,38 Thus, insectivorous species may
not need multiple pepsins to digest insect proteins, whereas chitinase
is essential for the digestion of insect exoskeletons.2 As the diversity and complexity of proteins in the diet
of Sunda pangolins, which feed on ants and termites, are stable, a
large number of parallel and redundant systems for dietary protein
digestion would not be needed. The digestive enzymes in the animal
gut represent the response to dietary diversity, and changes in their
expression or type are essential to allow dietary adaptations, including
those enabling the use of complex or otherwise indigestible foods.2 Sunda pangolins can digest artificial food made
from invertebrates well but not feed containing fish meal, eggs, or
dairy products.32 Because different proteases
have different specific pockets where single peptide bonds are hydrolyzed,31,39,40 the inability to digest some
products may be related to the absence in the pangolin digestive system
of chymotrypsin, elastase, and other proteases needed for the breakdown
of these proteins. The digestive system of Sunda pangolins also lacks
the enzymes needed to break down lactose, which explains why these
animals are unable to digest dairy products.2,41 Therefore,
artificial food for pangolins should be designed to be compatible
with the physiological characteristics of pangolin digestion, including
the spectrum of enzymes in its digestive system.

In the study
of endangered animals, one of the greatest challenges
is obtaining suitable samples.41,42 Some studies can be
invasive and difficult to perform with living animals.2 Moreover, even when samples are available, the sample size
often fails to meet the general requirements of experimental research.
The intensive illegal hunting and trade of pangolins have led to a
rapid global decline in the populations of these animals.43,44 They are difficult to study because of their nocturnal habits, rarity,
secretiveness, and solitary nature. They cannot be captured for research
needs because they are critically endangered on the IUCN Red List
of Threatened Species. Although the samples examined in this study
were collected from a single dead Sunda pangolin, they provided basic
data and an opportunity to elucidate more about the digestive physiology
of this species. However, the results of this study only comes from
one pangolin, we need to obtain more samples for in-depth studies
to validate the results. Then, we will be able to better understand
the digestive physiology of this species.

Conclusions
The
proteases expressed are simplified in the tested Sunda pangolin
intestinal tract. This might indicate that species’ adaptation
to its diet is stable with respect to protein diversity and complexity
because the pangolin feeds exclusively on ants and termites. Chitinase
has been detected in its saliva and intestinal juice and allows the
efficient digestion and utilization of ants and termites. This may
reflect its adaptation to a chitin-rich diet. KEGG annotation of the
proteins in the pangolin’s intestinal juice also implied that
chitin provides carbon, nitrogen, and energy, and is therefore a substantial
nutrient for the Sunda pangolin. Although only one Sunda pangolin
was available for our study, it provided us with a valuable opportunity
to understand the digestive physiology and eating habits of this critically
endangered species.

Materials and Methods
Subject
Samples
were taken from a female Sunda pangolin
(HS-04) at the Pangolin Research Base for Artificial Rescue and Conservation
Breeding of South China Normal University (PRB-SCNU). The pangolin
weighed 1.8 kg when it arrived at PRB-SCNU and died 1 day later because
of unknown causes.

Collection of Saliva and Intestinal Juice
Immediately
after its death, pangolin HS-04 was dissected. No obvious lesion was
found in its oral cavity or intestines. The back of a clean scalpel
was used to gently swab the saliva on the tongue surface and the inside
of the pangolin’s cheek. Intestinal contents were collected
3–5 cm past the opening of the duodenal bile duct. All collected
fluids were placed in a cryopreservation tube and stored immediately
in liquid nitrogen, and then shipped to the laboratory on dry ice.
Although gastric juice of this pangolin was also collected during
sampling, the sample was exposed to room temperature for a long time
because of the damage of the packaging box of gastric juice during
transportation, which seriously affected the quality of the sample,
so it was not tested and analyzed.

The pangolin was housed and
post-mortem sampling was conducted in accordance with procedures approved
by the Ethics Committee for Animal Research at SCNU and the Guidelines
for Animal Care established by the National Institute of Health.

Sample Preparation and Protein Separation by SDS-PAGE
The
samples were prepared following the methods of Wiśniewski
et al45 After the addition of SDT buffer,
the samples were boiled for 15 min and centrifuged at 14 000g for 40 min; the protein in the supernatant was then quantified
using a BCA protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The samples
were then stored at −80 °C.

For sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, 20 μg of protein per sample was mixed with
5× loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated
on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (constant 14 mA current, 90 min), and
the resulting bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining.

Filter-Aided Sample Preparation
The proteins in the
samples were digested using a filter-aided sample preparation method.45 For each sample, 200 μg of protein was
mixed with 30 μL of SDT buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and 150 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.0). The detergent, DTT, and other
low-molecular-weight components were removed using UA buffer (8 M
urea and 150 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.0) by repeated ultrafiltration (Microcon
units, 10 kDa). Reduced cysteine residues were blocked by the addition
of 100 μL of iodoacetamide (100 mM indole-3-acetic acid in UA
buffer). The samples were then incubated for 30 min in the dark, washed
three times with 100 μL of UA buffer and twice with 100 μL
of 25 mM NH4HCO3 buffer, and then incubated
overnight at 37 °C with 4 μg of trypsin (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) in 40 μL of 25 mM NH4HCO3 buffer.
The resulting peptides were collected as a filtrate, desalted on C18
cartridges [Empore SPE C18 cartridges (standard density), bed I.D.
7 mm, volume 3 mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA], concentrated by vacuum
centrifugation, and reconstituted in 40 μL of 0.1% (v/v) formic
acid. The peptide content was estimated based on the absorption at
280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.1 for a 0.1% (g/L) solution,
calculated based on the frequencies of tryptophan and tyrosine residues
in vertebrate proteins.

Shotgun LC–MS/MS and Data Analysis
Nano LC–MS/MS
was performed on the products obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis
of 3 g of samples according to the quantitative results, and each
sample was injected once. The peptide mixture was loaded onto a reverse-phase
trap column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100, 100 μm ×
2 cm, nanoViper C18; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected
to a C18 reversed-phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific EASY-Column,
10 cm long, 75 μm inner diameter, 3 μm resin; Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and separated with a linear
gradient of buffer B (84% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at a
flow rate of 300 nL/min, controlled by IntelliFlow technology. The
linear gradient was as follows: 0–35% buffer B for 50 min,
35–1100% buffer B for 5 min, and holding in 100% buffer B for
5 min.

LC–MS/MS was performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an EASY-nLC device [Proxeon
Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific)] for 60 min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in the positive ion mode. MS data were acquired using
a data-dependent top 10 method, with dynamic selection of the most
abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (300–1800 m/z) for HCD fragmentation. The automatic
gain control target was set to 3 × 106, and the maximum
injection time to 50 ms. The dynamic exclusion duration was 60.0 s.
Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70 000 at m/z 200; the resolution for the HCD spectra
was set to 17 500 at m/z 200
and the isolation width to 2 m/z. The normalized collision energy was 27 eV, and the underfill ratio,
which specifies the minimum percentage of the target value likely
to be reached at maximum fill time, was defined as 0.1%. The instrument
was run with the peptide recognition mode enabled.

The MS data
were analyzed using MaxQuant ver. 1.5.3.17 (Max Planck
Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany)46 and searched against uniprot_Laurasiatheria_553856_20180403.fasta
(553 856 total entries, downloaded 03/04/2018, http://www.uniprot.org). An initial
search was set at a precursor mass window of 6 ppm. The search followed
an enzymatic cleavage rule of trypsin/P and allowed a maximum of two
missed cleavage sites and a mass tolerance of 20 ppm for fragment
ions. It was designed as follows: enzyme = trypsin, missed cleavage
= 2, fixed modification: carbamidomethyl (C), variable modification:
oxidation (M), and decoy database pattern = reverse. The cutoff of
the global false discovery rate for peptide and protein identification
was set to 0.01.

No unexpected or unusually high safety hazards
were encountered.
