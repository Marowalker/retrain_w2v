Large multidomain proteins occur
in different conformational states
to function. Detection and monitoring of these different structural
states are of crucial interest for understanding the mechanics of
proteins. Using computational methods, we show that different protein
conformational states of the two-domain 70 kDa human Heat-shock protein
(hHsp70), with similar vibrational density of states, lead to remarkably
different far-IR spectra at acoustical frequencies (ν < 300
GHz). We found that the slow damped motions of the positively charged
residues of hHsp70 contribute the most to collective IR active modes
at low frequencies (ν < 300 GHz). We predicted that different
structural states and functional modes of large proteins, such as
hHsp70, might be detected in the sub-THz frequency range by single-molecule
spectroscopy similar to the recent extraordinary acoustic Raman spectroscopy
(Wheaton S.  ; Nat. Photonics 2015 , 9 , 68 −72 ).

Introduction
Human 70 kDa heat-shock proteins (hHsp70) are highly conserved
molecular chaperones essential for all living cells.1−4 They are related to many diseases and are promising targets for
anticancer therapies.5−8 The structure of hHsp70 comprises two main domains: a nucleotide-binding
domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) connected together
via a flexible linker. Each domain is divided into subdomains (Figure 1A): IA, IB, IIA,
and IIB for the NBD and α and β for the SBD.3,9 The nucleotide and substrate bind to a cleft at the interface between
subdomains IA and IIA and to the SBD-β, respectively.10

and closed (blue) conformations.

To perform its chaperone biological function, the hHsp70
protein
occurs in two main conformational states depending on the nucleotide
status of its NBD9,11−14 (Figure 1A). In the ATP-bound state of the NBD, called
the open conformational state, the NBD and the SBD are docked, leading
to a compact structure9,11,12 (gyration radius = 2.7 nm, largest distance = 8 nm),9 as shown in Figure 1A. In the ADP-bound state of the NBD, called the closed conformational
state, the NBD and SBD domains are free to move independently and
the structure is elongated (gyration radius = 3.4 nm, largest distance
= 12 nm),9 as also shown in Figure 1A. Further structural differences
between the two main conformations are found: the SBD-α lid
covers the substrate-binding pocket in the closed conformation,15 whereas it is docked to subdomain IA of the
NBD in the open conformation. Finally, the linker is buried into a
cleft located between subdomains IA and IIA of the NBD in the open
conformation, whereas it is free in the closed conformation.16,17

There is considerable interest in hHsp70 in medicine, and
detection
of the exchange between the different conformations of human Hsp70
is crucial to understand the function of this key molecular chaperone.
In this work, we theoretically examine the possibility of detecting
these conformational changes by measuring the sub-THz vibrational
modes of hHsp70 in single-molecule spectroscopy.

For 4 decades,
there has been considerable theoretical interest
in establishing the role of sub-THz normal modes in the protein biological
function.18−37 Sub-THz vibrational modes, called acoustical modes,38 involve large-scale displacements of protein segments.
The acoustical modes do not depend on the atomistic details of the
molecular structure but are mainly dependent on the protein shape
and on the connectivity of its main chain. The acoustical modes are
thus the modes that are the most influenced by a change in the global
shape/size of a protein induced by a conformational change. Low-frequency
vibrational modes of proteins were measured by neutron scattering,39−49 Raman spectroscopy,50−55 and far-IR spectroscopy.56−60 The first well-resolved acoustical modes
of several proteins at frequencies as low as 20–100 GHz were
detected very recently using a nanobiosensing technique: extraordinary
acoustic Raman (EAR) spectroscopy.61

In EAR spectroscopy, a single molecule is confined in an optical
trap and is excited by a low-frequency electromagnetic field (10–300
GHz), which interacts with the protein acoustical modes. The low-frequency
electromagnetic field is obtained by interference between two optical
lasers of slightly different wavelengths. Despite its name, EAR spectroscopy
differs drastically from Raman spectroscopy. The spectrum of the trapped
protein is obtained by measuring the variations of its Brownian motion
in the optical trap as a function of the frequency of the applied
electric field. An increase in the positional fluctuations of the
trapped molecule at the frequency of the applied electric field is
interpreted as a vibrational resonance. As mentioned in the original
paper describing EAR,61 the mechanism leading
to this resonance is not clear. Because the acoustical modes of spherical
nanoparticles are usually Raman active, this was supposed to be the
case also for the acoustical modes of proteins excited by the oscillating
electric field.61 The authors suggest that
the physical mechanism leading to the excitation of the acoustical
modes in EAR is electrostriction, that is, the nonlinear elastic response
of a material to an electric field.61 However,
as shown here and elsewhere,62 the protein
acoustical modes are IR active, and the linear response of proteins
to an electric field must contribute significantly to the EAR spectrum.
Therefore, in this work, we theoretically examine the possibility
of detecting the different conformational states of the key hHsp70
chaperone by exciting its acoustical modes using a low-frequency electric
field in a nanobiosensing experiment such as EAR.

Results and Discussion
Because of the strong coupling between the protein and solvent,
the protein and its first solvation shell can be considered an integrated
system.63 The vibrational modes of hHsp70
surrounded by water (TIP3P model64) were
computed in the harmonic approximation using the all-atom CHARMM2765−67 and the AMBER99sb-ILDN68−70 potential energy surfaces using
the GROMACS software package.71 Protein
structures plus water molecules of the first hydration shell (at 3
Å around the protein) were extracted from snapshots of all-atom
MD simulations of hHsp70 as detailed in previous works9,38 (more details can be found in the Materials and
Methods section). Vibrational modes discussed below are computed
using the AMBER force-field.

Below 300 GHz (ν̃ =
10 cm–1), there
are 24 and 26 collective modes for the open and closed conformations,
respectively (Figure 1B). The lowest nonzero frequency mode of hHsp70, that is, ν7, occurs at 82.8 GHz (ν̃7 = 2.76 cm–1) for the open conformational state and at 43.8 GHz
(ν̃7 = 1.46 cm–1) for the
closed conformational state. This difference Δν of 39.0
GHz (Δν̃ = 1.3 cm–1) can be explained
by the fact that the closed state has a more elongated structure than
the open state, for which the two domains are docked. Therefore, the
closed state of hHsp70 may subtend modes of longer wavelength than
the open state of hHsp70 and thus of lower frequency (Figure 1). However, these differences
between the two main conformational states of hHsp70 are not visible
in their density of states D(ν), as shown in Figure 1B. Therefore, at
first glance, it seems not possible to identify the two main conformational
states of hHsp70 based on the sole measurement of D(ν), using for example inelastic neutron scattering.39 However, on the basis of the experimental results
of EAR spectroscopy,61 one may expect the
acoustical modes to interact with an electric field. Each acoustical
mode should have a different signature in the EAR or in the far-IR
spectra of hHsp70 depending on its dipole moment. A variation of the
molecular dipole moment at acoustical frequency is expected because
hHsp70 has a strong dipolar character, as 81 residues are positively
charged and 92 are negatively charged (Table 1).

The variation of the
dipole moment of the hydrated molecule ρ⃗l induced by the lth vibrational
mode of frequency νl is given by 1  where qi and mi are, respectively,
the charge and mass of atom i, e⃗il and ξl are the eigenvector component of atom i and
the normal coordinate of the lth mode, respectively. N is the total number of atoms of the hydrated molecule
(including water), and p⃗ is the dipole moment
of the molecule induced by the elastic deformation of the molecule 2  where u⃗i is the displacement of atom i in
the harmonic approximation.

In the frequency range [0−300]
GHz, variations of molecular
dipole moment |ρ⃗l| of the
open and closed conformations of hHsp70 were computed and are presented
in Figure 2. From the
24 and 26 modes of the open and closed conformations of hHsp70, only
a few contribute significantly to the variation of the molecular dipole
moment. For example, in the open state, the mode that exhibits the
largest variation of molecular dipole moment is the mode ν8 = 107.7 GHz (ν̃8 = 3.59 cm–1), whereas in the closed state, it corresponds to the mode ν9 = 61.4 GHz (ν̃9= 2.05 cm–1). In addition, the norm of the largest variation of molecular dipole
moment in the closed state of hHsp70 is larger than that in the open
state. To obtain a better understanding of the dipolar active modes,
we computed the dipole due to the displacement of each atom, ρ⃗i l = qiu⃗i l, in every acoustical mode l. The contributions
of every atom to the variation of molecular dipole moment, ρ⃗l, were summed over all of the atoms of each
residue (see Figure 3A,D) and over all atoms of a subdomain (see Figure 3B,E) for both conformations of hHsp70.

dipole moments |ρ⃗l| as a
function of frequency νl for the
open (top panel in green) and closed (bottom panel
in blue) conformations of hHsp70. Vibrational dipole moments were
computed using eq 1 from
the normal modes computed using the AMBER99sb-ILDN force-field.

conformation for mode ν8. Blue and red points indicate
positively and negatively charged residues, respectively. (B) Vibrational
dipole moment |ρ⃗l| as a
function of the subdomain index of hHsp70 in the open conformation
for mode ν8. (C) Cartoon representation of vibrational
dipole moment directions and strengths projected onto the hHsp70 open
(not deformed) structure for mode ν8. The color code
is the same as in Figure 1B. This figure was prepared with PyMOL. (D), (E), and (F)
are the same panels as panels (A), (B), and (C), respectively, but
for mode ν9 of the closed conformation of hHsp70.

We deduce from Figure 3A (open state) and D (closed
state) that the largest contributions
to the vibrational dipole moments are due to the positively charged
residues of hHsp70. Compared to negatively charged residues, ARG and
LYS residues are characterized by longer side chains, that is, L ∼ 6.4 Å (L ∼ 2.6 Å
for ASP and L ∼ 4.0 Å for GLU), which
leads to larger variation of the dipole moments in a vibrational mode.
In detail, in mode ν8 of the open conformation, subdomain
IIB (Figure 3B,C) has
the largest dipolar contribution, followed by the two subdomains of
the SBD. In fact, the global motion observed for this particular mode
corresponds to a torsional motion of subdomain IIB of the NBD and
of each subdomain β and α of the SBD. A similar analysis
is performed for the low-frequency mode ν9 of hHsp70,
having the largest variation of the molecule dipolar moment in the
closed conformational state. In mode ν9 of the closed
conformation, the largest dipolar contribution arises from the deformation
of the SBD-α
(Figure 3E,F). Particularly,
positively charged residues (ARG) located in the C-terminal part of
Hsp70 exhibit large dipole moments. The SBD-α is the most charged
subdomain of hHsp70, with a total charge of −8 (Table 1). Furthermore, compared with
the open state of hHsp70, the closed conformation mode, ν9, shows dipole moments that are more distributed along the
entire protein, and, more precisely, all of the four subdomains of
the NBD exhibit large dipole moment variations (Figure 3E). This is because the two domains of the
closed state can move freely and do not interact with each other,
which do not block some motions compared with the open conformation.
The global motion of mode ν9 corresponds to a stretching
motion, that is, a compression/elongation of the two lobes of hHsp70,
as depicted by black bold arrows in Figure 3F. In addition to the difference in shape
between the open and closed conformations of hHsp70 (Figure 1A), the fact that the two main
domains of the closed state do not interact with each other leads
to larger vibrational dipole moments than those for the open state.
These differences in the hHsp70 conformational states could serve
as spectroscopic fingerprints at low frequencies (below 300 GHz).

Because the lowest frequency acoustical modes exhibit variations
of molecular dipole moment as shown in Figure 3, they interact with an applied electric
field E⃗. The energy absorbed by hHsp70 from
the source of a low-frequency applied electric field was calculated
from the all-atom normal mode calculations using the Newton equation,
leading to the following formula for the classical absorption (IR)
spectrum72 3  where ν is the frequency, E⃗(ν) is the applied electric field at frequency
ν, γ
is a constant damping factor, and νl is the frequency of the lth normal mode (see the Materials and Methods section for details).

Equation 3 includes
the effect of damping (assumed here to be identical for all acoustical
modes), which is usually ignored in the computation of the IR spectra
from normal mode analysis. However, damping is a crucial parameter
to interpret correctly the experimental data. One source of damping
is the effect of bulk solvent, which dissipates the vibrational energy
of the protein. In the present all-atom calculation, the representation
of the solvent is described at two levels: explicitly by taking into
account all water molecules of the hydration layer and implicitly
by representing the bulk solvent by a damping factor. The calculation
of the vibrational modes of a large hydrated protein such as hHsp70
is a “tour de force”, as it corresponds to the diagonalization
of a large matrix (38 055 × 38 055 for the closed
state for example), and it is not possible to represent explicitly
the effect of the bulk solvent. Unfortunately, the value of the damping
of acoustical modes of proteins in water is not well known. No values
are reported for molecular chaperones in the literature. Data for
lysozyme in solution suggest that the acoustical modes of this protein
are overdamped in solution with γ = 594 GHz (ν̃
= 18 cm–1),63 whereas
an undamped mode was observed at 630 GHz (ν̃ = 19.6 cm–1) in low-hydrated lysozyme.56 In EAR spectroscopy, the damping of a protein with a size similar
to hHsp70 (conalbumin61) is typically on
the order of a few GHz. Because the value of the damping of low-frequency
modes of proteins varies depending on the experimental technique,
we decided to explore the range of values reported for different proteins
using different techniques. In addition, as the scale of the protein
motions is similar in the acoustical modes, one chooses an identical
value of the damping coefficient for all of the acoustical modes computed.
The IR spectra P(ν), as given in eq 3, are thus computed by considering
different values of γ corresponding to weakly damped to overdamped
modes. As explained below, the damping has a huge impact on both intensities
and positions of the peaks in the IR spectra. Figure 4 shows spectra P(ν)
of hHsp70 for the open and closed conformational states as a function
of the value of the damping constant γ (in the computed spectra,
the prefactor in eq 3, , was set arbitrarily to 1 in
this work).
First of all, it is clear from Figure 4 that the open and closed conformations show different
spectra P(ν), independently of the value of
the damping constant γ and independently of the force-field
used for the calculations. For example, in the case of the AMBER99SB-ILDN
force-field (Figure 4A), in the spectra P(ν) calculated for γ
= 30 GHz (ν̃ = 1.0 cm–1), the closed
conformation of hHsp70 shows an intense peak centered at ν =
45 GHz (ν̃ = 1.5 cm–1), whereas the
same peak is shifted to ν = 108 GHz (ν̃ = 3.6 cm–1) for the open conformation. As expected, an increase
in the damping constant γ from 3 GHz (ν̃ = 0.1 cm–1) to 30 GHz (ν̃=1.0 cm–1) goes together with an increase in the width of the peaks and with
a decrease in the spectral resolution but does not change the position
of the peaks because all acoustical modes have frequencies larger
than γ/2 (regime of damped modes). By increasing the damping
constant from 30 GHz (ν̃ = 1.0 cm–1)
to 300 GHz (ν̃ = 10 cm–1), another phenomenon
is observed in Figure 4. There is a shift of the most intense peak of the closed conformation
to a lower frequency, namely, 15 GHz (ν̃ = 0.5 cm–1), because the lowest frequency ν7 is smaller than γ/2 (regime of overdamped modes). For a large
γ = 300 GHz, the spectra above 45 GHz of the open and closed
conformational states of hHsp70 are similar with no single peak. As
shown in Figure 4 for
hHsp70, even for γ as large as 300 GHz, the two conformational
states of the protein can be distinguished below 45 GHz. Note that
exactly the same conclusions can be drawn from the calculations using
the CHARMM27 force-field (Figure 4B). Finally, the structures of the nucleotide-free
and the ADP-bound closed models of hHsp7073 are very similar, as are the spectra of their acoustical modes,
as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 4 (A) THz spectra P(ν) of hHsp70 for the open
(green) and closed (blue) conformations computed from the normal modes
calculated using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force-field. Spectra with different
damping γ are represented: 3 GHz (top panel), 30 GHz (middle
panel), and 300 GHz (bottom panel). Surface representation of open
(in blue) and closed (in green) conformations of hHsp70 are shown
in the inset of the top panel. (B) Same results from NMA using the
CHARMM27 force-field.

Figure 5 THz spectra P(ν) of hHsp70 for the closed
conformation of ADP-bound hHsp70 (pink) compared to the closed conformation
of nucleotide-free hHsp70 (blue, identical to the blue spectra shown
in Figure 4A). The
spectra were computed from the normal modes calculated using the AMBER99SB-ILDN
force-field. Spectra with different damping γ are represented:
3 GHz (top panel), 30 GHz (middle panel), and 300 GHz (bottom panel).

Conclusions
To summarize, we demonstrated
that in the sub-THz frequency range
the main conformations (open and closed) of hHsp70 could be distinguished
because they exhibit different spectroscopic fingerprints at acoustical
frequencies. These nonsimilar fingerprints are due to different vibrational
dipole moments of the open and closed conformations of hHsp70 and
due to the fact that the two main conformations are characterized
by strongly different shapes. These results should prompt nanobiosensing
experiments, such as EAR61 spectroscopy,
for Hsp70 proteins that are of great interest in medicine. In practice,
the ability to distinguish the spectra of the different conformational
states of hHsp70 will depend on the time scale of the experimental
method because hHsp70 occurs as a dynamical ensemble.73,74 Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer experiments
show that the conformations of hHsp70 interchange on a time scale
of 1–4 s.74 Recording a full spectrum
on a shorter time scale is however feasible in single-molecule spectroscopy.75

Materials and Methods
Normal Mode Calculations
The two hydrated structures
of hHsp70 used to compute the normal modes in Figure 4 are the representative structures extracted
from the MD of the nucleotide-free open and closed models.9,38,73 These two structures were chosen
because they were extracted from the longest MD runs and because they
are the best representative relaxed structures of the open and closed
conformations, respectively. The hydrated structure of ADP-bound hHsp70
used to compute the normal modes in Figure 5 was extracted from a previous MD run.73 For the all-atom calculations, only the first
hydration water layer of hHsp70 was kept corresponding to 915 (open),
939 (closed), and 988 (closed and ADP-bound) water molecules, all
within 3 Å from the protein atoms. Then, the hydrated hHsp70
structures were optimized using the limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
algorithm implemented in the GROMACS software package71 with a force criterion of 10–9 kJ/mol/nm
using the AMBER99SB-ILDN68−70 as well as CHARMM2765−67 force-fields and the TIP3P water model.64 The cutoff distance for the short-range neighbor list was 1.4 nm
with the simple method and no periodic boundary condition. Switch
type was used for both Coulomb and non-Coulomb potentials (with a
standard cutoff of 1.0 nm and a switch cutoff of 1.2 nm). Finally,
the Hessian was computed and diagonalized using the same parameters.
For each system, it was verified that the first 6 eigenfrequencies
were equal to zero, and there was no imaginary frequency.

Classical Absorption
Spectrum
The classical absorption
spectrum formula [eq 3] is derived as follows (adapted from a previous work on the IR response
of a solid surface72). The single hydrated
protein is described as a set of uncoupled forced harmonic oscillators 4  where l = 7 to 3N – 6, N being the number of atoms, fl(t) is the
effective external force driving the lth vibrational
mode of the system with a frequency , and ξl is the normal coordinate of mode l.72 Modes l = 1–6 are the
zero-frequency modes of a single isolated molecule and are ignored.
In biomolecular force-fields used in this work to compute the normal
modes of the hydrated proteins, the electric density of the protein
and of the solvent is represented by fixed effective atomic charges.
In this approximation, the effective force fl due to an external uniform electric field E⃗ is given by72 5  where qκ and mκ are, respectively, the
effective charge and mass of atom κ, and e⃗κ l is the eigenvector component
of atom κ of the lth mode. Note that ρ⃗l is the derivative of the molecular dipole
moment relative to the normal coordinate.

In eq 4, we have introduced a phenomenological
damping factor γl and a Langevin
random force Fl(t). At steady state, the external force fl(t) does work on the
oscillator that is eventually dissipated as heat in the viscous fluid
(the random force Fl(t) does not work on the oscillator on average). The energy
gained by the lth oscillator due to the work of the
external force fl is 6  Using Fourier transforms
in eqs 4–6 and after a little algebra,62 the energy
absorbed by the set of oscillators, W = ∑lWl, is given by 7  Finally, averaging the orientation
of the
molecule relative to the applied electric field62 leads to the final formula of the classical absorption
spectrum by a single molecule due to an applied electric field in
the harmonic approximation 8  where  is the excitation frequency of the electric
field, and h is the Planck constant. The classical
absorption spectrum formula [eq 8] was implemented in C language and performed from GROMACS
standard output files (.xvg and .top).71
