New ternary and quaternary
NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys (with x = 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1) are
proposed as promising candidates for
photon energy conversion in photovoltaic applications. The effects
of Te doping on crystal, spectral, and optical properties are studied
within the framework of periodic density functional theory. Increasing
Te content decreases the band gap (Eg)
considerably (from 3.96 (x = 0) to 1.62 eV (x = 0.67)) and fits a quadratic model (Eg(x) = 3.96–6.78x + 4.70x2, (r2 = 0.96, n = 4)). The band gap of 1.62 eV makes
the NaYS0.67Te1.33 alloy ideal for photovoltaic
applications for their ability to absorb in the visible segment of
the sunlight spectrum. The calculated exciton binding energies are
9.78 meV for NaYS1.33Te0.67 and 6.06 meV for
NaYS0.67Te1.33. These values of the order of
the thermal energy at room temperature suggest an easily dissociable
hole–electron pair. The family of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys are, therefore,
promising candidates for visible photocatalytic devices and worthy
of further experimental and theoretical investigations.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, photovoltaics and photochemical systems have attracted
much attention as clean and renewable sources of energy.1−3 The semiconductors upon which these systems are designed are characterized
by a number of properties that include, for example, the band gap
(generally below 3 eV, which falls within the visible spectrum), a
high absorption coefficient (α > 104 cm–1), a low effective mass (m* < 0.5 m0), an exciton binding energy Eb below 25 meV in ambient temperature, and a high relative dielectric
constant (εr) value.4,5

The light
conversion steps can be broken down conceptually into
light absorption, exciton dissociation, and diffusion of charge carriers,
steps that are depicted diagrammatically
in Figure 1. In this
work, a rational design of new photovoltaic materials is undertaken
in advance of synthesis on the basis of optimizing these values by
varying the percentage of doping in computational “experiments”.

Figure 1 Representation
of the three fundamental steps in photovoltaic and
photochemical systems involving a semiconductor. The quantitative
values of the requirements are determined.

The absorption is modeled theoretically by the interband
electronic
transitions. A material with a band gap between 1.4 and 3 eV (i.e.,
in the visible spectrum) is required for photovoltaic or photochemical
applications.1,5−7 In this region,
a solar cell represents a compromise between a high photocurrent and
a high photovoltage. On the other hand, the energy of such excitons
is sufficient to drive certain chemical reactions in photochemical
devices4 such as the splitting of water
(that require a band gap of approximately 2 eV4).

The binding energy of the exciton, denoted as Eb, is the electron–hole energy that must be as
low as possible to facilitate dissociation. For thermal energy to
be able to dissociate, the exciton Eb should
be less than kBT (i.e.,
approximately 25 meV at room temperature). The commonly used materials
in photovoltaic devices have Eb values
of <25 meV leading to values of εr exceeding 10.8−12

The mobility of the charge carriers in these systems should
be
high, which implies low effective masses. Generally, an effective
mass smaller than 0.5 m0 (m0 being the rest mass of the electron) in semiconductors
is considered as an indicator of good mobility.12−15

Alkali-metal–rare-earth
sulfides ALnS2 (A = alkali
metal, Ln = rare earth (commonly a lanthanide)) have attracted much
attention recently because of their considerable technological importance
for electronic and optoelectronic devices.16 The study of Jarý et al. on ternary sulfides ALnS2 showed the technological importance of these compounds, for example,
in the development of X-ray phosphors or white LED solid-state lighting.16−18 Most ALnS2 materials are wide band gap semiconductors
(>3 eV).19 The high absorption coefficient
in the UV region of KLnS2 (Ln = Nd, Ho, Er, and Lu) makes
them particularly useful for photovoltaics intended for space technology.20 From a chemical standpoint, electronegativity
plays an important role in the band gap width. Pauling electronegativity
of the chalcogen atoms decreased from S to Te (S = 2.58, Te = 2.10)21 with a corresponding decrease in band gap width
(<2 eV) in ALnTe2 (A = Li, Na, Rb, and Cs; Ln = Cs,
Y, and La).22

In this work, we performed
an ab initio study on NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys (with x =
0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1) and calculated their effective
mass m*, band gap Eg,
dielectric constant εr, and exciton binding energy Eb as functions of Te concentration. The goal
of the study is to determine the suitability of these materials for
photovoltaic or photochemical applications.

The NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys (with x = 0, 0.33, 0.67,
and 1) have trigonal-type structures with the space group number 166
(R3̅m).23 The NaYS2 compound was synthesized for the first
time in 1964 by Ballestracci and Bertaut24 followed by several experimental studies.19,25−31 On the other hand, the NaYTe2 compound was studied theoretically
by Shi et al.22 To the best of our knowledge,
however, there are no experimental or theoretical studies on the Te-doped
NaYS2 system. In the present study, the electronic structures
and properties of NaYS1.33Te0.67 and NaYS0.67Te1.33 alloys are investigated since, with the
exception of their crystal structures and some basic electronic properties,
most of the essential physical properties of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys remain unknown.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Properties
The pure compounds,
whether NaYS2 or NaYTe2, crystallize in the
α-NaFeO2-type trigonal structure with the space group
166 (R3̅m). The alloys NaYS2(1–x)Te2x (with x = 0.33 and x = 0.67) have
the lower triclinic symmetry P1 (space group 1).
Projections of the NaYS2(1–x)Te2x structures are presented in Figure 2. These crystals can be described
as a pseudo-cubic structure distorted along the [111] direction packed
of chalcogen atoms, while the (Na and Y) cations are situated in alternating
layers with distorted octahedral coordination. In addition, each Na
or Y atom is surrounded by six chalcogen atoms, allowing us to see
this structure as a pack of sheets [Y+3X–2] made up of YX6 octahedrons sharing only edges between
them, while the sodium ions occupy the octahedral sites between these
sheets. The NaX6 intersheet octahedrons share only edges
between them and with the YX6 octahedrons of the adjacent
layers (Figure 2a).
The crystal structure as a function of Te concentration is presented
in Figure 2b–e.
Optimized lattice parameters a and c, unit cell volume (V), c/a ratio versus the Te concentration x,
and the available experimental data and other theoretical predictions
are collected in Table 1 for comparison.

Because of small structural
differences of the optimized geometries
obtained with the different tested DFT Hamiltonian, we can observe
that there is an excellent agreement with experiment and other existing
theoretical results for the determination of lattice parameters. The
best agreement is shown with experiment results from GGA-PBE calculations.
The maximal relative error on the a and c parameters is found to be approximately 1% lower than the experiment
and theoretical values calculated by other authors (Table 1). The PBE0 functional leads
to the lowest values of cell parameters, while HSE06 provides intermediate
ones between those of PBE0 and GGA-PBE. Results show that a parameters are close (<0.03% error), with the difference
between c being larger (by 1% error).

From
pure NaYS2 (x = 0) to pure NaYTe2 (x = 1), the lattice parameters a of the NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys show almost no change as a function
of composition; however, the c parameter shows a
marked increasing trend with x (Figure 3). Moreover, the new lattice
constants a(x) or c(x) for the quaternary systems can also be estimated
according to Vegard’s law32 1   2  where aNaYS2, cNaYS2, aNaYTe2, and cNaYTe2 are the
equilibrium lattice constants
of the parent NaYS2 and NaYTe2 ternary compounds,
respectively.

Figure 3 Lattice parameters of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys as functions of Te
concentration
(results from GGA-PBE calculations).

The lattice constants exhibit a good agreement with Vegard’s
law (with small deviations due to the mismatch of the lattice constants
of the parent ternary compounds NaYS2 and NaYTe2). The studied compounds having c/a values larger than 4.89 (2√6) confirm that the structure
of these compounds is α-NaFeO2-type trigonal.33 The increase in the c/a ratio is explained by the increasing chalcogen ionic radius.

2.2 Band Gap
Most of the physical properties
in solids are related directly or indirectly to the electronic band
structure. As mentioned in the Introduction, the energy band gaps of semiconductor alloys are important for
their applications in photovoltaic or photochemical devices. Thus,
knowledge of the electronic band parameters and their compositional
dependence in semiconductor alloys is necessary to elucidate their
domains of application. The reader is reminded that materials with
band gaps between 1.4 and 3 eV (i.e., in the visible spectrum) are
required for photovoltaic or photochemical applications.1,5−7 The optimal gap for photovoltaics is not the same
as the optimal gap for photochemical applications: For photovoltaic
devices, Eg is recommended to be between
1.3 and 1.4 eV to avoid high photocurrent and high photovoltage inside
the cell,4,34 but that does not preclude the production
of solar cells based on materials with Eg of >1.4 eV (examples include GaAs (1.52 eV),14 CdSe2 (1.73 eV),12 SrSnS3 (1.6 eV)6). Photochemical
devices are based on materials that have band gaps slightly higher
than those in photovoltaic materials (between 1.8 and 2.2 eV) so that
the photon energy is sufficient to trigger a given reaction. For instance,
the splitting of water requires an Eg of
approximately 2 eV. There are other materials that have Eg higher than 2 eV and are commonly used for efficient
photochemical devices such as TiO2 (3.2 eV)35 and BiVO4 (2.4 eV).36 Furthermore, electronic transitions from i(k) → j(k′)
are defined by the nature of the band gap. In absorption calculations
via the imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric
function, only direct i(k) → i′(k) electronic transitions should
be taken into account, and hence, the determination of the direct
interband transition is important to light-energy conversion processes.

We have performed calculations of the electronic energy band structure
on a discrete grid of points along lines connecting high symmetry k-points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) at the optimized geometry
obtained using the PBE, PBE0, and HSE06 functionals. The best agreement
between experiment and our theoretical results is achieved with the
hybrid functionals PBE0 and HSE06, which use a fixed portion of the
Hartree–Fock exchange (25% exact HF exchange) in PBE0 and the
mixing of traditional semilocal and nonlocal screened HF exchange
energies (suitable choice of the Coulomb screen parameter ω
= 0.11a0–1) in HSE06.37,38 This reduces the DFT
self-interaction error.39,40

Figure 4 displays
the band diagrams of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x (with x = 0, 0.33,
0.67, and 1) calculated by the HSE06 functional. The zero-energy value,
that is, the Fermi energy, is located at the maximum band valence.
It can also be seen from this figure that the highest occupied valence
band is located at Γ and the lowest unoccupied one in the conduction
band is located at F points, which indicates that these materials
are characterized by an indirect band gap.

Figure 4 Calculated band structure
diagram along the high-symmetry lines
for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys. The Fermi level is set to zero energy. The pure and
alloyed crystals have different space groups, while the pure compounds
(top panel) form trigonal crystals, and the alloys (NaYS2(1–x)Te2x for x = 0.33 and 0.67) (bottom panel) form a triclinic space group. Therefore,
the E–k diagrams of the alloys
cannot be directly compared to those of the pure compounds, however,
the value of the gap is what matters the most (results from HSE06
functional calculations).

The calculated band gaps are tabulated in Table 1 along with results obtained
from previous
calculations. It is well known that a pure DFT Hamiltonian such as
LDA or PBE underestimates band gaps while Hartree–Fock (HF)
overestimates them when gauged against the experiment. The presently
calculated band gaps obtained from the hybrid HSE06 and PBE0 Hamiltonians
are clearly larger than those from the PBE-GGA. One can observe from Figure 4 that the band gap
decreases for intermediate concentrations of Te (x = 0.33 and 0.67 in NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys) and then increases beyond x = 0.67. This suggests that sunlight absorption efficiency
by these solid solutions (0.33 < x < 0.67)
is higher than those by the other alloys.

A nonlinear relationship
is found between the band gap (calculated
using the HSE06 functional) and Te content, declining fast at first
with the fraction of the Te dopant reaching a minimum at x = 0.67 and then slightly rising at x = 1 (Figure 5). The dependence
of the band gap energy (in eV) on x has been fitted
to a quadratic function (r2 = 0.96, n = 4): 3  

Figure 5 Band gap energies
of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys as a function of Te concentration
(results from HSE06 functional calculations).

The narrowing of the band gap can be rationalized as follows:
The
energy levels of Te are higher than the energy levels of S, which
leads to an up-shift of the band valence (as described below). On
the other hand, the difference of the electronegativity between S
and Te atoms has also an obvious role in this gap narrowing in which
Te atoms donate electrons to the empty d-Y states.

The electronic
band structure (Figure 4) exhibits new features when the parent NaYS2 is doped
with Te, and these changes depend essentially on
the dopant concentration x. Furthermore, in the near
Fermi region (the Fermi level is set at 0 eV), the maximum E(k) dispersion is observed in the Γ–F
and Γ–Z directions, while there is a quasi-flat band
in the Γ–Γ direction for the quaternary alloys
with x = 0.33 and 0.67. With increased concentration
(x = 1), the maximum E(k) dispersion remains in the Γ–F direction, whereas a
flatness of the band in the Γ–Z direction is observed.
However, the dispersion along the symmetry lines of the Brillouin
zone in the near Fermi region is more pronounced in alloys with x = 0.33 and 0.67. As a consequence, we expect smaller effective
masses for the charge carriers (holes in the valence band and electrons
in the conduction band) and higher mobilities, enhancing charge-carrier
kinetics for these two alloys.

We have also calculated the total
density of states (TDOS) and
partial density of states (PDOS) for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys (with x = 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1) to further characterize the band states. Figure 6 displays the calculated
TDOS and PDOS diagrams for the different NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys. It can
be seen from the figure that the valence band (VB) is formed by two
regions: The first region ranges between −14 and −11
eV and is composed of mainly s-X (X = S, Te) and a little p-Y states.
Interestingly, the s-X states shift to slightly lower energy magnitudes
(from −14 to −11 eV). The second region, between −5
eV and around the Fermi level, arises from the 3p and 5p orbitals
of the S or Te atoms, respectively, hybridized with a small contribution
of d-Y states. In the conduction band (CB), d-Y states are the main
components with a minor contribution from the s-Na and p-chalcogen
states. It can be concluded, thus, that the optical gap is mainly
determined by the main electronic transition between X–2 valence bands to Y+3 conduction bands.

Figure 6 Diagrams representing
the calculated total and partial densities
of states (TDOS (left) and PDOS (right), respectively) for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys. The Fermi level is set to
zero energy (results from HSE06 functional calculations).

The interaction between the p-Te and p-S states
that occupy the
region just below the Fermi level results from the repulsion between
them, moving the valence band upward. This shift increases with Te
content up to a concentration of 67%, and subsequently, the valence
band of NaYS0.67Te1.33 moves up more than the
NaYS1.33Te0.67. When the Te concentration reaches
100% (i.e., pure NaYTe2), this repulsion is lifted, and
hence, an increase in the band gap is observed for NaYTe2. The DOS curves for alloys of compositions x =
0.33 and 0.67 are very similar. These results reveal a drastic change
in the electronic structure of the alloys from that of their corresponding
parent ternary compounds. Since materials with band gaps between 1.1
and 3 eV can be used in visible light energy conversion,7 the studied alloys NaYS2(1–x)Te2x (x = 0.33, 0.67, and 1), which all have a gap below 3 eV (Table 1), appear to be promising
for visible light energy applications.

Crucial properties that
determine the applicability of a semiconductor
in a photovoltaic or a photochemical device include the effective
mass (m*), the dielectric constant (εr), and the exciton binding energy (Eb). These calculated properties will now be discussed.

2.3 Effective Mass of the Charge Carriers
The effective
mass governs electron transport in materials. Electrons
with energy close to the valence band maximum behave almost like free
electrons. Thus, m* affects the mobility of charge
carriers and the binding energy of the exciton (since the lower the m*, the lower the Eb (eq 12)).

The calculated
effective masses for the investigated materials for different Te content
in NaYS2(1–x)Te2x are reported in Table 2. As can be seen from the table, generally, m* computed with the different functionals all have the same order
of magnitude. We note in passing that Shi et al.22 reported the hole effective mass for NaYTe2 calculated
by HSE06 Hamiltonian and that their results are very close to our
results (0.84 m0 and 0.76 m0, respectively). Our results indicate that the electron
effective masses are smaller than hole masses for all of the studied
alloys, which leads us to classify these semiconductors as n-type
conducting materials.

The effective masses for well-established
materials used in converting
light energy in devices have values of less than 0.5 m0 and, therefore, a high mobility.4 The NaYS1.33Te0.67 and NaYS0.67Te1.33 alloys have electron and hole effective masses
(me* and mh*, respectively) lower than 0.5 m0 (me* = 0.20, mh* =
0.42 and me* = 0.15, mh* = 0.29 for NaYS1.33Te0.67 and
NaYS0.67Te1.33, respectively). This implies
that these two solid solutions have highly mobile charge carriers.
In contrast, the parent ternary compounds NaYS2 and NaYTe2 have electron and hole effective masses that are greater
than 0.5 m0 (me* = 0.97, mh* = 1.47 and me* = 0.29, mh* = 0.76 for
NaYS2 and NaYTe2, respectively), making the
charge carriers in these compounds have a smaller mobility. Note that,
as one goes from pure NaYS2 (x = 0) to
pure NaYTe2 (x = 1), the electron effective
mass decreases nonlinearly (Table 2). This suggests that the electron mobility increases
with Te doping up to x = 0.67. As discussed above,
the narrow gap between the conduction and valence bands in NaYS1.33Te0.67 and NaYS0.67Te1.33 leads to a strong interaction between p-S and p-Te state hybridization,
which makes the charge carriers more delocalized and have a higher
mobility than the parent ternary NaYS2 and NaYTe2 compounds.

2.4 Dielectric Constants
The electrostatic
(binding) force between the electron and hole decreases with the dielectric
constant with a consequential increase in the tendency of the exciton
to dissociate. In the Computational Methods section, we have recalled that the charges constituting the material
(electron density and the ions of the lattice) are polarized when
an incident static electric field or radiation is applied. Moreover,
the electronic dielectric ε∞ part (which reflects
the polarizability of the electron density) and the vibrational one
εvib (which reflects ion displacement in the crystal
lattice) present the two contributions that make up the total dielectric
constant εr of the material.

Table 2 lists the dielectric constants
obtained from coupled perturbed PBE and PBE0 calculations. The PBE
and PBE0 functionals reproduce the increase of electronic dielectric
ε∞ and vibrational εvib values
in NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys as functions of Te concentration. This increase in
polarizability follows the well-known trends as one moves down in
the periodic table (from S to Te, in this case) and is also assisted
by the hybridization between the p-S and p-Te states. We note that
most values calculated by PBE0 are between 11 and 14, and the highest
εr is obtained for NaYS0.67Te1.33, which makes this solid solution the one with the smallest electron–hole
electrostatic force F and the one with the smallest
exciton binding energy. On the other hand, NaYS2 has the
lowest εr dielectric constant suggesting that this
compound has the largest exciton binding energy (discussed below).

Both the electronic and vibrational contributions to the static
dielectric constant are larger with PBE than with PBE0 possibly due
to the pure DFT Hamiltonian’s underestimation of the band gap.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no experimental
or theoretical estimation for this property in the literature for
comparison. Therefore, this study can be a baseline for future experiments
on these materials.

2.5 Exciton Binding Energy
According
to the Wannier model,41 the exciton binding
energy (Eb) can be evaluated with a hydrogenoid
model that involves only the knowledge of the dielectric constant
of the semiconductor and the effective masses of the charge carriers.
In order to achieve an efficient dissociation of the exciton at room
temperature, the binding energy Eb must
be lower than the thermal energy (25 meV). Because the exciton generation
is faster than atomic motions in the crystal, only the electron density
can reorganize at this time scale giving an unrelaxed exciton.42 The unrelaxed exciton binding energy can be
evaluated only from ε∞. After a characteristic
time lag due to difference in the characteristic time scales of nuclear
and electronic motions, when the nuclei/ions relax to adapt to the
altered electron density, a relaxed exciton results. At that time
scale, the charge screening will be governed by εr. For optoelectronic applications (such as photovoltaic and photochemical
devices), the time scale of the exciton dissociation is higher than
the atomic motions; it is assumed that the charge screening is governed
by the relaxed exciton, and consequently, Eb corresponds to the binding energy of the relaxed exciton.4

The exciton binding energies calculated
by PBE are found to be smaller than the ones obtained from PBE0 (about
30%) due to the overestimation of εr given by PBE
as said previously. We can see from the literature that there is a
relation between the exact HF exchange and  (the inverse of the
electronic dielectric
constant) in which the band gap is well reproduced. For this, we observe
that the PBE0 (with 25% of HF exchange) is a more reliable approximation
for compounds having ε∞ around 4.43,44 The exciton binding energy is larger than 25 meV for the NaYS2 compound (40.41 meV), while its value decreases under 25
meV with increasing Te concentration. The smallest binding energies
are those calculated for NaYS1.33Te0.67 and
NaYS0.67Te1.33 solid solutions (9.78 and 6.06
meV, respectively). Since these values are below the thermal energy,
this means that these excitons are weakly bound and can be dissociated
at room temperature. Furthermore, the smallest effective masses are
obtained for NaYS1.33Te0.67 and NaYS0.67Te1.33 (Table 2), so not only they are easier to dissociate but also the
charge carriers have an easier diffusion through the lattice.

2.6 Optical Properties
The knowledge
of the relationship between optical and electronic properties of the
materials is key for their industrial applications. The dynamic optical
properties like frequency-dependent dielectric functions ε(ω),
reflectivity R(ω), and energy loss function L(ω) are calculated in the 0 to 20 eV range of radiation
energy by the PBE0 functional with the coupled perturbed (CP) method
for their possible photoconversion applications.

The knowledge
of the both imaginary ε2(ω) and real ε1(ω) parts as functions of electromagnetic wave frequency
allows calculating other important linear optical characteristics
using the following relations: 4   5  where n and l are the initial and
final states, M is
the dipole matrix, fn is the Fermi distribution
function for the ith state, and Ei is the energy of the electron in the ith state. Meanwhile: 6  where P is
the Cauchy principal value of the integral. Further, the reflectivity
and the electron loss function are expressed, respectively, as 7   8  

The real
part of the dielectric function describes polarization,
and the imaginary one describes absorption. The imaginary part is
derived by the optical transitions between occupied and unoccupied
bands.45

To describe the optical
anisotropy of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys, ε1(ω) and
ε2(ω) are calculated
for three different polarizations of the incident light along the
three principle crystallographic directions (i.e., E→ // [100], E→ // [010], E→ // [001] where E→ is the electric field vector
of the incident radiations). From Figures 7 and 8, one can observe
differences in the intensities and energetic positions of the peaks
and structures in ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) spectra for E→ // [100] and E→ // [001] polarizations, which indicates a substantial anisotropy
of the optical properties of the considered systems.

of the incident radiations, whereby x refers to 100
and z refers to 001 crystallographic axes, respectively.
(Results from CP-PBE0 calculations).

Figure 8 Imaginary ε2(ω) part of the dielectric function
of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys versus photon energy for different polarizations of
the incident radiations, whereby x refers to 100
and z refers to 001 crystallographic axes, respectively.
(Results from CP-PBE0 calculations).

Figure 7 shows
the
calculated CP-PBE0 spectrum for the real part of the complex dielectric
function ε1(ω) for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys. The plots
in the figure show that the optical dielectric constant before resonances
ε1(ω = 0) increases from 4.2 (3.3) to 6.4 (4.9)
with the increase of the Te concentration for the E→ // [100] (E→ // [001]) direction of polarization.
On the other hand, it is well known that the polarizability of elements
increases when we go down in a column of the periodic table making
pure NaYTe2 the highest optical dielectric constant. Finally,
the plots reveal that the variation of static optical dielectric constant
values for the [001] direction is less marked than the component of
the one for the [100] crystal direction.

Figure 8 presents
the energy position and relative amplitudes of specific absorption
in the imaginary ε2(ω) part of the dielectric
response of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys calculated by the CP-PBE0 method. After the
absorption edge, ε2(ω)E→ // [100] and ε2(ω)E→ // [001] increase rapidly. The peaks
appearing in the energy range between 3 and 10 eV in the ε2(ω) spectrum arise from the direct interband i(k) → i′(k) electronic transitions between the occupied states in the
valence band and the unoccupied ones in the conduction band. From
the DOS analysis, we observe that these transitions have the character
of p-S and/or p-Te orbitals in the valence band and d-Y in the conduction
band in the NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys.

From the plots, we can see that the
highest ε2(ω) peaks are at around 6 eV and
shifts to 8 eV from NaYTe2 to NaYS2. Moreover,
the imaginary part for the
[001] direction is less marked than that for the [100] direction,
indicating the anisotropy of optical properties in these materials.

Figure 9 presents
our calculated frequency-dependent reflectivity coefficient R(ω) spectra for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys with the two light
polarizations. The reflectivity does not approach unity when the photon
frequency (incident radiation) tends toward zero, meaning that these
materials behave like semiconductors and the NaYS2(1–x)Te2x materials are transmitting
for frequencies less than their energy band gap. The reflectivity
increases with increasing Te content in NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys. It is also
evident from the figure that the reflectivity increases with increasing
incident photon energy. The calculated R(ω)
increased approximately by about 35% compared to its static reflectivity
(i.e., R(0)) along the [100] and [001] directions
at 3 and 6 eV, respectively. Moreover, the reflectivity R(ω) decreases until 5% at energy larger than 17 eV for the
series of alloys. We can find in the literature that the R values for materials commonly used in the light conversion process
are about or less than 40% in the visible energy range.46,47 The reflectivity of Si, InP, and GaP nanowire materials used for
photovoltaic applications ranges between 30 and 40%.48 Further, to ensure a low reflectance amount in materials
and consequently a high photon to electron conversion efficiencies,
researchers made antireflection films to increase the absorption ratio.49−51

energy (results from CP-PBE0 calculations).

The electron energy loss function L(ω)
is
another important factor describing the energy loss of a fast electron
crossing the material.52 Computational L(ω) spectra are obtained in the energy range of 0–30
eV with PBE0 and are reported in Figure 10 for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys. It is obvious from
the figure that, for photon energy less than the band gap of a material,
no energy loss occurs. Above the energy band range, a fast electron
crossing is observed and increased with the photon energy.

energy loss function L(ω) NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys versus photon
energy, whereby x refers to
100 and z refers to 001 crystallographic axes, respectively.
(Results from CP-PBE0 calculations).

The most interesting features in the L(ω)
spectrum are the main peak observed for all polarizations of the incident
light at approximately 16 eV along the [100] and [001] directions
for NaYTe2 and that shifts toward high energy until 22
eV for the NaYS2 compound. Moreover, the peaks correspond
to the trailing edges in the reflection R(ω)
spectra. Optical data for the NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys are not found in the
literature, and we hope that our calculations will motivate further
experimental efforts on this material. By combining the measured data
with the calculation results, a comprehensive understanding of the
electronic and optical properties of the studied material is possible.

3 Conclusions
Notwithstanding environmental
considerations, DFT calculations
have demonstrated that NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys are potential light energy
converters. The calculated cell parameters are in excellent agreement
with available experiment and theoretical results for PBE, PBE0, and
HSE06 functionals. The lattice parameter c exhibits
a nonlinear variation versus the telluride concentration (x), while a (=b) is unaffected.
The significant improvement in HSE06 and PBE0 with respect to the
PBE results can be attributed to the fact that the use of a fixed
portion of the Hartree−Fock exchange (25% exact HF exchange)
in PBE0 and the mixing of traditional semilocal and nonlocal screened
HF exchange energies in HSE06 reduce the self-interaction error of
the density functional and give a good amount of nonlocal exchange
to reproduce the electronic properties.

The studied compounds
have an indirect band gap, and the analysis
of the total density of states shows that all band gap energies are
described by the [Y+3–X–2] electronic
transitions (where X is S and/or Te). The calculated band gap energies
using the HSE06 approach are more accurate than those calculated by
PBE-GGA or by PBE0. Increasing Te content leads to a significant decrease
of the energy band gap from 3.96 (NaYS2) to 2.0 (NaYS1.33Te0.67), 1.67 (NaYS0.67Te1.33), and 1.78 (NaYTe2) eV.

Important fundamental properties
such as band gap Eg, effective mass m*, dielectric constant
εr, and exciton binding energy Eb were calculated and suggest the efficiency of these
compounds in light energy conversion. To the best of the present authors’
knowledge, the dielectric constant and the exciton energy binding
of these alloys have not been measured or calculated yet. By comparison
to semiconductors used in photovoltaic applications, we can conclude
that, among the considered compounds, NaYS1.33Te0.67 and NaYS0.67Te1.33 solid solutions are more
attractive for photovoltaic applications.

Optical properties
such as the dielectric function, reflectivity
and loss function were discussed in the 0 to 20 eV energy range with
the coupled perturbed method. The optical spectra of NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys shift toward
the lower energies with the increase of their amplitudes with increasing
telluride concentration, and they also present an anisotropic character.
Apart from the cell parameters and some electronic properties of the
studied materials, no data on these materials were found in the literature
for comparison; therefore, further experimental and theoretical studies
are suggested to exploit the real potential of these materials for
practical applications.

4 Computational Methods
Ab initio calculations using localized Gaussian
basis sets in conjunction with the density functional theory (DFT)53,54 were used as implemented in the CRYSTAL17 code39 (this code uses atomic orbital (AO) for building Bloch
functions (BF)). The choice of the exchange-correlation functional
is crucial, so three different Hamiltonians were tested to generate
the results: GGA-PBE,55 PBE0,56 and HSE06.57,58 The basis
sets used were HAYWSC-31 for sodium (Na),59 ECP HAYWSC for yttrium (Y),60 while the
core and valence electrons of sulfur (S) and tellurium (Te) were described
by DURAND-31G*61 and m-pVDZ-PP.62 The basis sets of Y, S, and Te atoms were modified
as follows: The d-Y, d-S, and (p and d)-Te orbitals are empty and
used as ″virtual orbitals″ with Y-(αd = 0.18), S-(αd = 0.064), and Te-(αp = 0.20 and αd = 0.12) exponents (α in bohr–2) Gaussian Type Functionals (GTFs) in order to enhance
charge redistribution, which gives a better estimation for the electronic
properties.63

The unit cell contains
a total of 12 atoms: three sodium, three
yttrium, and six chalcogenides. In CRYSTAL, the level of accuracy
in evaluating the Coulomb and exchange integrals is controlled by
five thresholds:40,64 T1 = T2 = T3 = T4 = 10–7 au and T5 = 10–14 au. Reciprocal space was sampled
using a shrinking factor equal to 8, corresponding to 260 k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) using the
Monkhorst–Pack k-points mesh.65 For more precision, the threshold on the root-mean-square
gradient and displacement was set to 10–3 au. The
convergence criterion for the SCF cycle was fixed at 10–8 hartree per unit cell during geometry optimization and dielectric
constant calculations. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
algorithm,66 which provides a fast way
to find the relaxed atomic position and minimum energy, was used.

The crystal properties were calculated as follows:• The effective
charge-carrier
mass was obtained by fitting the E(k) diagram in a small range close to the valence band (VB) maximum
and conduction band (CB) minimum to a parabola. The effective mass m* at a given point along the direction given by k was then obtained from

 9  • The dielectric
constant (εr) represents the polarization of a dielectric
material in
response to an external electric field or radiation. The polarization
due to the reorganization of the electronic density is denoted as
ε∞, while the contribution arising from the
displacement/vibration of ions is noted as εvib,
that is

 10  • The electronic contribution to
the static dielectric tensor was evaluated through a coupled perturbed
Hartree–Fock/Kohn–Sham (CPHF/KS) scheme,67 while the vibrational contribution was computed
from the harmonic phonon spectrum using eq 11

 11  where V is
the volume of the unit cell and ϑp and zp are the phonon frequency of the
mode p and the Born effective charge, respectively.• The binding
energy Eb of the exciton was calculated
using the Wannier exciton
model41 wherein the delocalized exciton
is treated as a hydrogen atom, the hole being the proton, and it can
be computed with the following formula

 12  where EH is the energy of the 1s orbital of hydrogen
(−13.6
eV), εr is the dielectric constant, and μ is
the reduced mass of the exciton.• The reduced mass of the exciton
was obtained from

 13  The effective masses, dielectric
constants, and exciton binding energies were then determined for NaYS2(1–x)Te2x alloys at different Te concentrations x (with x = 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1). Frequency-dependent CPHF calculations
of the dynamic dielectric properties in the range of photon energy
were also performed. In the coupled-perturbed (CP) method, orbital
relaxation was taken into account in the presence of the external
field (see details in ref (64)).

To dope the pure NaYS2 compound with
Te proportions x = 0.33 and 0.67, a P1 cell was constructed
first by breaking
the symmetry of the unit cell. Since on the one hand both S and Te
are isovalent (with a valency of 2) and on the other hand they have
not too dissimilar ionic radii of R(S) = 1.03 Å
and R(Te) = 1.23 Å,68 one can readily substitute S atoms by Te atoms in the lattice with
minimal distortion. In the lattice, there are 12 atoms, 6 chalcogenides
(S + Te), and 6 (Na and Y). The composition denoted by x = 0.33 is obtained by incorporating 2 atoms of Te and 4 atoms of
S in the unit cell, while the composition x = 0.67
is obtained by incorporating 4 atoms of Te and 2 atoms of S per unit
cell. This mode of doping that does not affect the crystal structure
was used in other isostructural materials in previous experimental
work (see ref (19)).
