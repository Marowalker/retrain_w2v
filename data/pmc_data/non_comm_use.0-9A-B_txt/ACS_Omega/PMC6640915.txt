The most simple and clear advantage
of Na-ion batteries (NIBs)
over Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is the natural abundance of Na, which
allows inexpensive production of NIBs for large-scale applications.
However, although strenuous research efforts have been devoted to
NIBs particularly since 2010, certain other advantages of NIBs have
been largely overlooked, for example, their low-temperature power
and cycle performances. Herein, we present
a comparative study of spirally wound full-cells consisting of Li0.1Na0.7Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (or Li0.8Co0.5Mn0.5O2) and hard carbon and report that the power of NIB at −30
°C is ∼21% higher than that of LIB. Moreover, the capacity
retention in cycle testing at 0 °C is ∼53% for NIB but
only ∼29% for LIB. Raman spectroscopy and density functional
theory calculations revealed that the superior performance of NIB
is due to the relatively weak interaction between Na+ ions
and aprotic polar solvents.

1 Introduction
Alchemists
in the Middle Ages attempted to transform base metals
into noble metals. Today, modern-day alchemists are attempting to
replace critical elements with abundant elements for the sustainable
development. In the field of energy storage and transport, Na-ion
batteries (NIBs) have received considerable attention as an alternative
to Li-ion batteries (LIBs) because of the natural abundance of Na
in the earth’s crust.1−7 Thus, cost-effective NIBs are thought to be suitable for large-scale
applications in devices such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), electric
vehicles (EVs), and stationary energy storage systems (ESSs).4

The operation principles of NIB and LIB
are the same; alkali metal
cations move back and forth between two insertion-electrodes through
an electrolyte without the destruction of the crystal structure framework.2 However, replacing Li+ ions with Na+ ions in the battery is a difficult task. One of the issues
facing NIB is its lower energy density compared with that of LIB.
NIB usually offers a narrower voltage window because of the more positive
redox potential (∼300 mV) of the Na metal.1−3,5 Moreover, owing to the large ionic radius (r) of Na+ ions, the volumetric capacity of positive
electrode materials for NIB is lower than that for LIB.3 Here, rNa+ = 1.02
Å and rLi+ = 0.76 Å when the
coordination number is 6.8 These drawbacks
arise from the intrinsic nature of Na+ ions; therefore,
other advantages besides the natural abundance of Na are required
to incentivize the replacement of LIB.

As has been pointed out
by several researchers,9−12 the large size of rNa+ could be an advantage
for NIB because of the commensurate
weakness in Lewis acidity. Indeed, density functional theory (DFT)
calculations have predicted that desolvation energies (Edsol) between Na+ ions and various organic
solvents are ∼25% lower than those for Li+ ions.
For instance, Edsol in diethyl carbonate
(DEC) for Na+ and Li+ ions is 147.5 and 207.7
kJ·mol–1, respectively.9 Furthermore, Na+ ion conductivity (σion) in NaClO4 solutions is greater than that in LiClO4 solutions in the wide concentration range between 0.5 and
2 M.12 Because Edsol and σion significantly influence the kinetics of
the insertion/extraction process, NIB is expected to exhibit superior
electrochemical performances at high current densities. However, to
the best of our knowledge, direct comparison of the electrochemical
properties of NIB and LIB has not been reported in the literature.

When examining the power performance and/or rate capability of
a battery, the internal resistance (Ri) should be minimized as possible. We, therefore, constructed spirally
wound cylindrical full-cells with large electrode surface areas (Aele) above 486 cm2, although previous
full-cell studies for NIB were performed using coin-type cells with Aele < 2 cm2.13−16 We also used a P2-type Li0.1Na0.7Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (NCMO) and an O2-type Li0.8Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (LCMO) as positive electrode materials for the NIB
and LIB, respectively, where LCMO was prepared from NCMO by an ion-exchange
reaction. These selections were informed by reports that P2-type Na0.67Co0.5Mn0.5O2 shows excellent
rate capabilities17 and that O2-type compounds
such as Lix[Li1/3Mn3/4]O214 and Li2/3[Co0.15Mn0.85]O218 maintain a layered structure and are not converted into a spinel
structure during electrochemical reactions.

To clarify the advantages
of NIB over LIB, we investigated the
power and cycle performances at low temperatures of two types of the
cylindrical battery: NCMO|1 M NaPF6 dissolved in the ethylene
carbonate (EC)/ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) solution (EC/EMC = 3:7
by volume), hereafter denoted as NaPF6(EC/EMC)|hard carbon
(HC), and LCMO|1 M LiPF6 dissolved in the EC/EMC solution
(EC/EMC = 3:7 by volume), hereafter denoted as LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC.
We found that NIB exhibits excellent power and cycle performances,
especially below 0 °C, compared with those of LIB.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Structure and Electrochemical
Properties
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the (a) NCMO and (b) LCMO samples,
respectively, obtained using the XRD measurements with the Fe Kα radiation. The crystal structure of NCMO is assigned
as a P2-type layered structure with the P63/mmc space group, as reported previously.14,17 The lattice parameters of the ah- and ch-axis are calculated to be 2.837(1) and 11.145(1)
Å, respectively, by a least-squared method using more than 13
diffraction lines. As shown in the inset in the left of Figure 1a, the NCMO sample is not in
a single phase but contains a small amount of Li2MnO3 impurity. Moreover, the intensity of the 002 diffraction
line is significantly stronger than those of the other diffraction
lines, probably due to selective orientation along the ch-axis. Indeed, particles of NCMO show a hexagonal shape
with a size of ∼7 μm in diameter and ∼2 μm
in thickness (inset in the right of Figure 1a). To clarify the amount of the Li2MnO3 phase, we performed the XRD measurement using the
synchrotron radiation for the NCMO sample. By using Rietveld analysis,
the weight fraction of the Li2MnO3 phase in
NCMO is determined to be 13.5% (Figure S1). The structural parameters of NCMO are also illustrated in Table S1.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of (a) Li0.1Na0.7Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (NCMO) and
(b) Li0.8Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (LCMO).
Enlarged XRD patterns
in the 2θ range between 16° and 24° are shown on the
left side of the inset, to clarify the existence of multiple phases
in the sample. The weight fraction of the Li2MnO3 phase in NCMO was determined to be 13.5% by Rietveld analysis. For
the LCMO sample, there are at least three different phases of A1,
A2, and A3 as well as the Li2MnO3 phase. SEM
images are also shown in the right side of the inset.

There are at least three different phases in the
LCMO sample other
than the Li2MnO3 phase. This is indicated by
the 002 diffraction line around 2θ = 20° splitting into
three distinct diffraction lines with d values of
5.30(1) Å for the A1 phase, 5.06(1) Å for the A2 phase,
and 4.86(1) Å for the A3 phase (see the inset in the left of Figure 1b). A mixed phase
with different interlayers is a characteristic of compounds prepared
using the ion-exchange reaction.14,18,19 The main phase of LCMO is assigned the O2-type structure,
in which Li+ ions have an octahedral coordination with
six oxygen atoms. The structural phase transition from P2-type of
NCMO and O2-type of LCMO is due to the difference between rNa+ and rLi+ ions.2,3,5 According to previous studies
on O2-type Lix[MyMn2–y]O2 with
M = Li and Co, several structural models are proposed. For instance,
the P63mc space group
for Lix[Li1/3Mn3/4]O2,14 the P3m1 space group for Li2/3[Li1/6Mn5/6]O2 and Li2/3[Co0.15Mn0.85]O2,18 and
the R3̅m space group for Lix[Co0.5Mn0.5]O2.20 If we use the structural models of
the P63mc or P3m1 space group, the lattice parameters
of the A2 phase, which is the major phase of the LCMO sample, are
calculated to be ah = 2.807(1) Å
and ch = 10.070(1) Å. The length
of the ch-axis is almost consistent with
that of the O2-type Lix[Li1/4Mn3/4]O2 (=9.778 Å)14 and with two-thirds of the O3-type Lix[Co0.5Mn0.5]O2 (=9.629 Å).20 As shown in the inset in the right of Figure 1b, the particle morphology
of LCMO is not significantly changed by the ion-exchange reaction;
most of the LCMO particles have a hexagonal shape of ∼5 μm
in diameter and ∼2 μm in thickness.

Before addressing
the results for power and cycle performances
at low temperatures, we first describe the electrochemical properties
at 20 °C. Figure 2a shows the initial charge and discharge curves for the half-cells
of NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na and HC|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na.
The former was operated at a current of 0.5 mA (≅0.282 mA·cm–2) in the voltage range between 1.7 and 4.5 V, whereas
the latter was operated at the same current in the voltage range between
0.02 and 2.5 V. The voltage of the NCMO cell increases from ∼3.0
V with increasing capacity and then almost keeps a constant value
at ∼4.4 V at capacities above 80 mA h·g–1. The charge capacity (Qcha) is ∼115
mA h·g–1. Owing to the relatively large polarization
between charge and discharge curves, the discharge capacity (Qdis) is limited to ∼65 mA h·g–1 when we set the discharge cut-off voltage at 3.0
V. Here, the Li2MnO3 phase is an electrochemically
inactive unless an exchange reaction of Li+ ions by H+ ions occurs21 or there are oxygen
vacancies in the Li2MnO3 lattice.22 The theoretical capacity (Qtheo) of NCMO is calculated to be 239 mA h·g–1 by assuming one-electron redox reaction. The decrease
from Qtheo is partially owing to the presence
of Li2MnO3 in NCMO, although we set the charge
cut-off voltage as 4.5 V. The voltage of the HC cell drops rapidly
from ∼2.0 to 1.2 V at the beginning of the discharge reaction,
then gradually decreases until ∼110 mA h·g–1, and finally approaches a constant voltage (∼0.02 V) as the
discharge reaction with proceeds further. The charge curve almost traces the discharge curve in the capacity
range 160 and 280 mA h·g–1, but the polarization
between the two curves is observed below 140 mA h·g–1. Thus, Qcha (=240 mA h·g–1) is slightly lower than Qdis (=280 mA
h·g–1). The results for the electrochemical
properties of NCMO and HC are comparable with previous results for
P2-type Na0.67Co0.5Mn0.5O217 or HC.13,16,23

°C:
(a) half-cells of Li0.1Na0.7Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (NCMO)|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na
and hard carbon (HC)|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na and (b) full-cell
of NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|HC. The solid red lines in (a) indicate
the corresponding charge and discharge curves in the full-cell, which
were estimated from the voltage range of the full-cell and the NCMO/HC
capacity ratio. The capacities of NCMO and HC in (a) were calculated
by the electrode weights of NCMO and HC, respectively. The charge
and discharge curves after the cycle test at 0 °C are shown in
(b) by the solid blue line.

Figure 2b
shows
the initial charge and discharge curves for the full-cell of NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|HC (black line). The Ri value of this cell was ∼29 mΩ at 1 kHz (Table S2). Also, the cell was operated at a charge
(discharge) current density of 100 (50) mA [≅0.21 (0.10) mA·cm–2] in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.5 V. The
charge reaction was conducted in a constant-current (CC) and constant-voltage
(CV) mode, whereas the discharge reaction was conducted in a CC mode.
For the charge reaction, the voltage increases with increasing capacity
until ∼100 mA h then remains constant at 4.5 V with a further
increasing capacity. For the discharge reaction, the voltage slightly
drops to ∼4.0 V and then decreases almost linearly with increasing
in the capacity. Qcha and Qdis are 170 and 160 mA h, respectively. Here we constructed
the NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|HC cell with a NCMO/HC capacity
ratio of 3.4; that is, the theoretical capacity of NCMO (HC) was assumed
to be 120 (280) mA h·g–1, based on the electrode
weight of NCMO (HC) (see Table S2). Therefore,
the corresponding voltage range in the NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na
cell is 3.70–4.50 V for the positive electrode, whereas that
in the HC|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na cell is 0.06–1.20 V for
the negative electrode (see the red lines in Figure 2a).

Figure 3a shows
the initial charge and discharge curves for the half-cells of LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li and HC|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li. The former
was operated at a current of 0.5 mA (≅0.282 mA·cm–2) in the voltage range between 3.0 and 4.5 V, whereas
the latter was operated at the same current in the voltage range between
0.02 and 2.5 V. The charge curve for LCMO rapidly increases from ∼3.3
V to ∼4.0 V at Qcha ≤ 20
mA h·g–1 then gradually increases until 4.5
V. Qcha and Qdis are ∼115 mA h·g–1. Note that the polarization
between charge and discharge curves is significantly smaller than
that for the NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na cell (see Figure 2a). In contrast to such electrochemical
properties, the polarization between the charge and discharge curves
for HC is increased in the case of the HC|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li
cell. Although the discharge curve for HC|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li
is similar to that for HC|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|Na, the charge
curve for HC|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li deviates from its discharge
curve above 0.1 V. Thus, the efficiency of Qdis/Qcha (=240/315 mA h·g–1) is limited to ∼76% for the HC|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li cell.

°C:
(a) half-cells of Li0.8Co0.5Mn0.5O2 (LCMO)|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li and hard carbon
(HC)|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|Li and (b) full-cell of LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC. The solid red lines in (a) indicate the corresponding
charge and discharge curves in the full-cell, which are estimated
from the voltage range of the full-cell and the LCMO/HC capacity ratio.
The capacities of LCMO and HC in (a) were calculated using the electrode
weights of LCMO and HC, respectively. The charge and discharge curves
after the cycle test at 0 °C are shown in (b) by the solid blue
line.

As shown in Figure 3b, the initial charge and discharge curves
of the LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC cell are similar to those
of the NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|HC cell. That is, the charging
(discharging) voltage monotonically
increases (decreases) until 4.5 (3.0) V. Moreover, Qdis for both cells is ∼155 mA h. Such similarities
are related to the NCMO/HC and LCMO/HC capacity ratios. Because both
capacity ratios are ∼3.4 (Table S2), the charge and discharge curves of the NCMO|NaPF6(EC/EMC)|HC
and LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC cells are mainly determined by
the HC characteristics, that is, the linear change in voltage in the
range between 1.0 and 0.2 V.

2.2 Power and Cycle Performances
at Low Temperatures
We investigated the power performances
at 20 and −30 °C
for seven NIBs and seven LIBs. As an example, the current (I) versus voltage (V) curves at −30
°C for an NIB and an LIB are shown in Figure 4a. The open circuit voltage before applying
the current was 3.899 V for the NIB and 3.875 V for the LIB. The V for the NIB rapidly drops to ∼3.10 V at I = 60 mA and then decreases to ∼1.88 V at I = 1200 mA with change in the I/V slope. Here, the maximum current (=1200 mA) corresponds
to ∼7.7 C based on the total capacity of the NIB. The I/V curve for the LIB is similar to that
for the NIB, but the decrease in V for the LIB is
remarkable, particularly at I ≥ 300 mA. Thus,
the power value at −30 °C is calculated to be 2.65 W for
the NIB and 2.00 W for the LIB using the I/V slope down to 2.5 V.

Figure 4 Results for the low-temperature power
and cycle tests. (a) Current
(I) versus voltage (V) curve at
−30 °C for NIBs and LIBs. The current was applied for
a duration (t) of 10 s at 50% of state of charge. V is the value when t = 10 s. (b) Powers
at 20 and −30 °C for NIBs and LIBs, which were calculated
by the V–I curves. (c) Cycle
performances for NIBs and LIBs at 0 °C. The capacity retention
after 200 cycles was ∼52% for NIBs and ∼29% for LIBs.

The power values for each of the
seven NIBs and LIBs are shown
in Figure 4b. The horizontal
axis indicates the power at 20 °C, whereas the vertical axis
indicates the power at −30 °C. There are variances in
the power values for both the NIBs and the LIBs. However, the power
values for the NIBs clearly range above those for the LIBs, indicating
that the power performances of NIBs are superior to those of LIBs
at both 20 and −30 °C. The average power value for the
NIBs is calculated to be 8.7(2) W at 20 °C and 2.5(2) W at −30
°C. By contrast, the average power value for the LIBs is calculated
to be 8.2(2) W at 20 °C and 2.0(1) W at −30 °C.

Figure 4c shows
the cycle number dependence of Qdis at
0 °C for an NIB and an LIB. The applied current (=750 mA) corresponds
to ∼5 C when we use the capacity at 20 °C. The initial Qdis for the NIB is 38 mA h, which is ∼25%
of Qdis at 20 °C. The Qdis value slightly drops to ∼30 mA h over the next
10 cycles and then decreases almost monotonically with further increase
in the cycle number. The capacity retention at the 200th cycle is
∼53%. For the LIB, the initial Qdis is 32 mA h, and a slight decrease in Qdis over the next 10 cycles is also observed. However, Qdis for the LIB decreases more after the 10th cycle, resulting
in a lower capacity retention of ∼29% at the 200th cycle. Although
the capacity fade of NIBs and LIBs is due to several different mechanisms,24 it can be classified into two types: one is
an irreversible loss in capacity (Qirre) that is not regained even at very low current density, and the
other is a capacity loss from a kinetic viewpoint. To clarify the
amount of Qirre for the NIB and LIB, charge
and discharge tests at 20 °C were performed with a low current
of 50 mA. As shown in Figures 2b and 3b, more than 140 mA h of Qdis was obtained for both NIB and LIB. Thus,
the amount of Qirre in the cycle tests
at 0 °C is limited to ∼10% for both NIB and LIB. In other
words, the capacity fade of the NIB and LIB is mainly attributed to
the kinetic problems.

Because commercial LIBs typically consist
of O3-type layered materials|LiPF6-based electrolyte|artificial
graphite (AG), we briefly describe
the difference in electrochemical properties between such LIBs and
LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC. The power values of LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA)|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|AG are ∼7.5 W at 20 °C and ∼1.65 W at
−30 °C (not shown), which are slightly lower than those
of LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC. Origins of this difference are
currently unclear because the redox potential of LCMO is ∼0.6
V higher than that of NCA, whereas the redox potential of HC is ∼0.5
V higher than that of AG.25 Further examinations
of LCMO|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|AG and NCA|LiPF6(EC/EMC)|HC
would provide crucial roles on power performances on 20 and −30 °C, including other
electrochemical properties.

2.3 Raman Spectroscopy and
DFT Calculations
Owing to the low Ri values of the spirally
wound full-cells (∼29 mΩ, see Table S2), we have revealed that NIBs have superior power and cycle
performances at low temperatures than those of LIBs. In this section,
we discuss the possible origins of these superior performances.

First of all, one can expect differences in ionic conductivity (σ)
and viscosity (η) between the NaPF6(EC/EMC) and LiPF6(EC/EMC) electrolytes. However, σ of NaPF6(EC/EMC) is almost the same as the reported σ of LiPF6(EC/EMC)26 in the temperature range between
−30 and 60 °C (Figure S2).
Furthermore, η of NaPF6(EC/EMC) is not very different
from the estimated η of LiPF6(EC/EMC) based on ion
solvation theory27 (Figure S3). Note that the transport number of Na+ ions in NaPF6, t(Na+), is
∼0.45,28 which is similar to the
transport number of Li+ ions in LiPF6, t(Li+), (≅0.48).29 Thus, physical parameters of the electrolytes such as σ, η,
and t(Na+) [t(Li+)] are unlikely to be the origins of the differences between
NIB and LIB.

The most probable possibilities are the difference
in coordination
structure with solvents between Na+ and Li+ ions
because the solvation/desolvation reaction is regarded as the most
important rate-determining step for a quick charge/discharge reaction.30 Thus, Raman spectroscopy was performed
to clarify the differences in the local structural environments of
NaPF6- and LiPF6-containing electrolytes. Figure 5 shows the (enlarged)
Raman spectra for the (a) EC/EMC, (b) NaPF6(EC/EMC), and
(c) LiPF6(EC/EMC) solutions. Their entire Raman spectra
in the frequency range between 1300 and 350 cm–1 are shown in Figure S4. In the Raman
spectrum of EC/EMC shown in Figure 5a, there are two major bands at 892 and 715 cm–1, which come from the EC molecule. The Raman bands
at 892 and 715 cm–1 are assigned as a ring-breathing
vibration with the A1 mode and a ring-bending
vibration with the B1 mode, respectively,
according to previous experimental31 and
theoretical32 studies of the EC molecule.
Schematics of these vibration modes are shown in the inset of Figure 5a. Note that recent
ab initio calculations33 on EC provide
slightly different assignments because the former two results31,32 are based on the C2v symmetry with Γ = 8A1 + 4A2 + 5B1 + 7B2, whereas the latter result33 is based on the C2 symmetry with Γ = 12A +
12B.

Figure 5 Enlarged Raman spectra of (a) ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethylmethyl
carbonate (EMC) solution (EC/EMC = 3/7 by volume), (b) 1 M
NaPF6 dissolved in the EC/EMC = 3/7 (v/v) solution, and
(c) 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in the EC/EMC = 3/7 (v/v) solution
in the frequency range of 950–630 cm–1.

As shown in Figure 5b, new Raman bands emerge at slightly higher
frequencies than the
original bands at 892 and 716 cm–1, when NaPF6 salt is dissolved into the EC/EMC solution; that is, Raman
bands at 898 and 722 cm–1 are observed. A similar
evolution of Raman bands is also seen in the Raman spectrum of the
LiPF6(EC/EMC) solution, although the shift in frequency
is larger in this case (Figure 5c). That is, the Raman bands at 903 and 727 cm–1 are observed in the vicinity of the original bands at 894 and 717
cm–1. Such an evolution of Raman bands is reported
for LiClO4(EC/PC)33 and LiClO4(PC)34 solutions, but as far as
we are concerned, results for NaPF6-containing electrolytes
are never reported. Note that the Raman band at 740 cm–1 in NaPF6(EC/EMC) [741 cm–1 in LiPF6(EC/EMC)] is due to the symmetric stretching vibration mode
of the PF6– molecule (see the insets
of Figure 5b,c).

We carried out DFT calculations to further elucidate the origin
of the different frequencies between the NaPF6(EC/EMC)
and LiPF6(EC/EMC) solutions. Figure 6 shows the calculated Raman spectra of (a)
EC, (b) [Na(EC)4]+, and (c) [Li(EC)4]+, together with each optimized molecular structure (see
the inset). Here, [M(EC)4]+, with M = Li and
Na, refers to the solvation shell of the M ions coordinated with 4EC
molecules. The calculated Raman spectra for EC, [Na(EC)4]+, and [Li(EC)4]+ are consistent
with the observed Raman spectra shown in Figure 5a–c, except for the intensity of the
Raman band at 701 cm–1. This Raman band is assigned
as the distortion of CH2–CH2. Two major
Raman bands for EC (899 and 716 cm–1) are shifted
in the higher frequencies when Na or Li ion is coordinated with the
4EC molecules. Moreover, the shift in the frequency is larger in the
case of Li ion, namely, 906 and 725 cm–1 for [Na(EC)4]+ and 908 and 730 cm–1 for [Li(EC)4]+. Because the averaged bond length between Li
and O, r(Li–O) = 1.97 Å, is much shorter
than r(Na–O) = 2.34 Å, the positive charge
is concentrated in a smaller space in [Li(EC)4]+ than in [Na(EC)4]+. A δ+ polarization
attracts the electronic cloud and can increase the energy required
for the changes in bond length and angle. Therefore, the shifts in
the frequencies in [Li(EC)4]+ are more significant
than in [Na(EC)4]+. We additionally calculated
[K(EC)4]+ and [Mg(EC)4]2+ to corroborate this hypothetical mechanism. The calculated bond
length, r(K–O) = 2.72 Å, suggests that
the positive charge is more widely dispersed in [K(EC)4]+ than in [Li(EC)4]+ and [Na(EC)4]+, and the Raman peaks are only slightly shifted
(Figure 6d). By contrast,
the two major Raman bands for [Mg(EC)4]2+ (=914
and 747 cm–1) are significantly shifted to the higher
frequencies because of the double positive charge (+2). The calculated
natural charges are consistent with the δ+ polarization
expected from the charges and optimized structures of the complexes
(see Table 1). The
DFT calculations also clarify that EC binding energies are on the
order of [Mg(EC)4]2+ (17.22 eV) ≫ [Li(EC)4]+ (4.31 eV) > [Na(EC)4]+ (3.47 eV) > [K(EC)4]+ (2.57 eV), where
the
binding energies were obtained as the differences in Gibbs free energy
between [M(EC)4]+ (or [M(EC)4]2+) and M+ (or M2+) + (EC)4 (M = Li, Na, Mg and K). The ordering is in complete agreement with
that of the predicted shifts of Raman peaks, which correlates with
the δ+ polarization on EC ligands.

As evident from the observed and calculated Raman spectra for various
electrolytes, one of the origins of the superior performances of NIBs
is due to the relatively weak interaction between the Na+ ions and EC molecules. It should be noted that the present finding
is opposite to the recent results for superconcentrated electrolytes
for high-voltage LIBs, where a strongly coordinated shell between
Li+ ions and solvents is effective in stabilizing electrolytes
at high voltages above 4.7 V versus Li+/Li.35 For producing a practical battery, overall battery
performances, such as power performance at low temperatures and stability
at high voltages, are assessed. Although ions species are different,
further low temperature studies including high voltage stability tests
could be useful to explore optimum electrolytes or solvents for NIBs.

Another possibility for the superior performances of NIB is the
difference in the ion-conduction pathways between P2-type NCMO and
O2-type LCMO,2,3,14 which
originated from the difference between rNa+ and rLi+. For P2-type NCMO, Na+ ions are located at the prismatic sites in NaO6 with
shared rectangular faces, leading to low activation energy for hopping
to adjacent Na+ sites. By contrast, for O2-type LCMO, Li+ ions are located at the octahedral sites in LiO6 with shared triangular faces and must first jump to vacant tetrahedral
sites to avoid strong Coulombic repulsions between O2– ions. Thus, the direct hopping of Na+ ions in the P2-type
NCMO could be an advantage for fast ion conduction, and this argument
is supported by the result of first principles calculations that diffusion
barriers in NaCoO2 are smaller than those in LiCoO2.36 Further electrochemical analyses
concerning diffusion coefficients at low temperatures could elucidate
differences in the power performances between NIBs and LIBs.

Finally, we wish to point out the significance of the present findings
from a technological aspect. For high-power applications such as HEVs
and plug-in HEVs, the total energy density required of a battery is
determined by its power at low temperatures. In other words, the battery
for such purposes is always overengineered to satisfy a lower limit
threshold of power at low temperatures. Thus, the excellent electrochemical
performances of NIBs at low temperatures decrease the energy density
of a battery, leading to the production of cost-effective batteries.

3 Conclusions
To clarify the advantages of
NIBs over LIBs, their power and cycle
performances at low temperatures were investigated using the spirally
wound full-cells, which have significantly low internal resistances
(∼29 mΩ at 1 kHz) than those of conventional coin-type
cells. In these batteries, we used P2-type NCMO and NaPF6(EC/EMC) for the NIBs and O2-type LCMO and LiPF6(EC/EMC)
for the LIBs. Alongside the above positive electrodes and electrolytes,
we used identical battery specifications, including the type of negative
electrode, the density of the electrodes, and the capacity ratio for
the NIBs and LIBs. The power values for the NIBs were 8.7(2) W at
20 °C and 2.5(2) W at −30 °C, whereas those for the
LIBs were 8.2(2) W at 20 °C and 2.0(1) W at −30 °C.
Furthermore, the capacity retentions in cycle tests at 0 °C were
53% for the NIBs and 29% for the LIBs. Thus, the superior electrochemical
properties of NIBs over LIBs are reported for the first time. According
to the Raman spectroscopy of the EC/EMC solvent and electrolytes,
the Raman bands at 892 and 715 cm–1 are shifted
to a higher frequency in the case of LiPF6(EC/EMC). The
DFT calculations clarified that the shift in the frequency increases
with increase in the binding energy between M and O atoms, where M
is Li, Na, K, and Mg ions and O is the ligand of the EC molecule.
Thus, the superior performances of NIBs over LIBs are attributed to
the relatively weak interaction between Na+ ions and aprotic
polar solvents.

As the history of alchemy reveals, it is difficult
to change one
thing into another. There is currently a wide variety of secondary
batteries such as lead–acid batteries, Ni–metal hydride
batteries, and LIBs, indicating that science provides the right battery
for the right place and time. Accordingly, the present findings offer
a novel utilization of NIBs, particularly at low temperatures.

4 Experimental
4.1 Sample Preparation
NCMO powder was
prepared by a solid-state reaction technique using reagent-grade Na2CO3 from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., and
reagent-grade Li2CO3, Co3O4, and Mn2O3 powders from Kojundo Chemical Laboratory
Co., Ltd. The powders were mixed thoroughly at a molar ratio of Li/Na/Co/Mn
= 0.1:0.7:0.5:0.5 and then preheated at 700 °C for 10 h in air.
The obtained powder was then thoroughly mixed again and finally sintered
at 1050 °C for 20 h in air. LCMO powder was prepared from NCMO
using an ion-exchange method. The ion-exchange of Na for Li is usually
performed in a molten LiNO3/LiCl salt solution or an aqueous
LiOH/LiCl solution.18,19 However, we used a more convenient
method in this study; we simply digested the NCMO sample into an LiPF6(EC/EMC) solution.37 Approximately
100 g of the NCMO power was immersed into 1 kg of 2 M LiPF6(EC/EMC) solution and stirred for 24 h in an argon-filled glove box.
Then, the sample was filtered and washed with the EMC solution five
times and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h.
When evaporating the EMC solution, we used a separable glass flask
to avoid contact between the sample and the moist air.

4.2 Characterization
The crystal structure
of the NCMO and LCMO samples was examined by powder XRD technique
equipped with Fe Kα (with a small amount of Fe Kβ) radiation (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS, Inc.). The NCMO
was also analyzed using XRD measurement at the synchrotron radiation
facility in the BL02 beamline of SPring-8, Japan. The sample was sealed
in a borosilicate glass capillary tube (W. Müller Glas Technik)
of 0.3 mm diameter. The wavelength of the X-ray was determined to
be 0.42 Å using the NIST-standard CeO2 powder (674a).
Rietveld analysis was performed using the RIETAN-FP software package.38 Particle morphologies were investigated by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM; S-3600N, Hitachi High-Technologies Co.,
Ltd.). σNa of the NaPF6(EC/EMC) solution
was determined by ac impedance measurements (1260 impedance/gain phase
analyzer, Solartron) in the temperature range between −30 and
60 °C. The frequency range was 0.5–105 Hz.
We also examined ηNa [mPa·s–1] of the NaPF6(EC/EMC) solution in the temperature range
between −30 and 40 °C using a rotational viscometer (ReoStress
600, Haake Technik GmbH). At each temperature, the shear stress τ
was measured at the shear velocity ν of 10, 30, 100, 300, 600,
and 1000 s–1. ηNa was calculated
from the Newtonian fluid region, that is, the linear ν dependence
of τ.

4.3 Preparation of Half- and
Full-Cells
We fabricated half-cells with Na metal or Li metal
and full-cells
with HC (CARBOTRON P, KUREHA Corp.). To prepare the positive electrodes,
a slurry, containing 85 wt % NCMO or LCMO powder, 10 wt % acetylene
black (AB), and 5 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), was cast onto an aluminum
current collector. To prepare the negative electrodes, a slurry, containing
95 wt % HC and 5 wt % PVdF dissolved in NMP, was cast onto a copper
current collector. After evaporating the NMP by vacuum-drawing at
120 °C for 5 h, the density of the active material for the NIBs
and LIBs was adjusted to 1.90 (0.76) g·cm–3 for the positive (negative) electrode. In fabricating the half-cells,
a Na metal or Li metal sheet pressed on a stainless steel plate (ϕ
19) was used as a counterelectrode. Meanwhile, to fabricate the full-cells,
the positive and negative electrodes were spirally wound with a polypropylene
separator of 25 μm thickness (TonenGeneral Sekiyu K. K.). The Aele values for the positive and negative electrode
were 486 and 560 cm2, respectively. The electrolyte used
was NaPF6(EC/EMC) for the NIB and LiPF6(EC/EMC)
for the LIB. We fabricated seven different NIBs and seven different
LIBs with ∼160 mA h of nominal capacity. Details of the electrodes,
such as electrode weight and electrode density, are summarized in Table S2. A photograph of a full-cell is also
shown in Figure S5.

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
The
electrochemical charge and discharge tests for the half-cells were
conducted at a current of 0.5 mA (≈0.282 mA·cm–2) at 20 °C. The voltage range of the Na half-cell was 1.7–4.5
V versus Na+/Na for the positive electrode and 0.02–2.5
V versus Na+/Na for the negative electrode. By contrast,
the voltage range for the Li half-cell was 3.0–4.5 V versus
Li+/Li for the positive electrode and 0.02–3.0 V
versus Li+/Li for the negative electrode. We applied exactly
the same electrochemical measurement conditions for the Na and Li
full-cells. Before and after cycle testing at 0 °C, charge and
discharge cycle tests were performed at 20 °C with a charge (discharge)
current of 100 (50) mA in the voltage range between 2.5 and 4.5 V.
We used the CC–CV mode for charging and the CC mode for discharging.
The duration of the CC–CV mode was 7 h. In addition, the value
of 100 mA corresponds to approximately 0.41 mA·cm–2 based on the surface area of the positive electrode. The cycle tests
at 0 °C were carried out at 750 mA over 200 cycles in the CC
mode. The power performances were investigated at both 20 and −30
°C. After adjusting the Na (or Li) full-cells to ∼50%
of state of charge (SOC), currents of 60, 100, 300, 450, 600, and
1200 mA were applied for a duration (t) of 10 s.
The power values were obtained using the voltages when t = 10 s.

4.5 Raman Spectroscopy and DFT Calculations
Raman spectroscopy was performed at room temperature using a 532
nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (NRS-3300, Jasco Co. Ltd.). The
acquisition time for one spectrum was ∼120 s, and the intensity
of the laser beam was 0.1 mW. Raman frequencies and intensities of
EC, [Li(EC)4]+, [Na(EC)4]+, [Mg(EC)4]2+, and [K(EC)4]+ were calculated using a DFT method with a B3LYP hybrid functional.39,40 The basis set used was Pople’s 6-311++G(d,p).41−43 The effect of EC/EMC = 3:7 mixed solvent was incorporated by using
the polarizable continuum model based on the integral equation formalism
(IEFPCM).44−46 The dielectric constant of EC/EMC = 3:7 was set to
be 18.5, which is a recently reported experimental value at 25 °C.47 Other parameters for the IEFPCM were kept at
their default values. Natural population analysis (NPA)48 was carried out to estimate the charge distributions
of these complexes. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian
09 program package.49
