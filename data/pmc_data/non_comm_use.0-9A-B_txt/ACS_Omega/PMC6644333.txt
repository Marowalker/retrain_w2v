Nonvolatile
memory, of which phase-change memory (PCM) is a leading
technology, is currently a key element of various electronics and
portable systems. An important step in the development of conceptually
new devices is the class of van der Waals (vdW)-bonded GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattices (SLs). With their order of magnitude
faster switching rates and lower energy consumption compared to those
of alloy-based devices, they are widely regarded as the next step
in the implementation of PCM. In contrast to conventional PCM, where
the SET and RESET states arise from the crystalline and amorphous
phases, in SLs, both the SET and RESET states remain crystalline.
In an earlier work, the superior performance of SLs was attributed
to the reduction of entropic losses associated with the one-dimensional
motion of interfacial Ge atoms located in the vicinity of Sb2Te3 quintuple layers. Subsequent experimental studies
using transmission electron microscopy revealed that GeTe and Sb2Te3 blocks strongly intermix during the growth
of the GeTe phase, challenging the original proposal but at the same
time raising new fundamental issues. In this work, we propose a new
approach to switching in SLs associated with the reconfiguration of
vdW gaps accompanied by local deviation of stoichiometry from the
GeTe/Sb2Te3 quasibinary alloys. The model resolves
in a natural way the existing controversies, explains the large conductivity
contrast between the SET and RESET crystalline states, is not compromised
by Ge/Sb intermixing, and provides a new perspective for the industrial
development of memory devices based on such SLs. The proposed concept
of vdW gap reconfiguration may also be applicable to designing a broad
variety of engineered two-dimensional vdW solids.

Introduction
Nonvolatile memory devices are currently
key elements of a wide
variety of electronics and portable systems (digital cameras, solid
state disks, smartphones, computers, e-books, tablets, etc.), and
their market has increased exponentially over the last decade. A leading
nonvolatile technology is phase-change memory with GeTe–Sb2Te3 quasibinary alloys being at the heart of phase-change
optical memory devices, such as digital versatile discs and Blu-Ray
discs, and also of recently commercialized nonvolatile phase-change
random-access memory. An important aspect of memory development is
to develop new memory storage concepts and devices that can integrate
multiple functionalities. A step in this direction was the proposal
to spatially separate GeTe and Sb2Te3 components
in the form of van der Waals (vdW) GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattices (SLs). The latter, also called interfacial phase-change
memory (iPCM), is characterized by an order of magnitude lower switching
energies, faster switching times, and increased cyclability.1 Subsequently, an experiment indicating an unusual
magnetic response of iPCM was reported2 and it was theoretically predicted that iPCM SLs with certain stacking
sequences can form topological insulator phases.3−6

One of the SL components,
Sb2Te3, possesses
a layered structure, where covalently bonded quintuple Te-Sb-Te-Sb-Te
layers (QLs) are held together by vdW forces. As a consequence, it
can be easily cleaved along the vdW gaps, forming atomically sharp
surfaces,7,8 similar to those of graphene and transition-metal
dichalcogenides, such as MoS2. It was argued that the two-dimensional
(2D) nature of such materials, where surfaces do not have any dangling
bonds, can be utilized to fabricate heterostructures with atomically
flat interfaces. In addition, the vdW nature of the interfacial interaction
allows for the fabrication of high-quality heterostructures between
materials with significantly different lattice constants.9,10

The other constituent, GeTe, is a three-dimensional (3D) material
with a rhombohedral structure11 that can
alternatively be viewed as a distorted rock-salt structure with three
shorter and three longer bonds. Because of the pronounced difference
between the shorter and longer bonds (2.83 vs 3.15 Å) and the
accompanying bonding energy hierarchy,12 it can be considered as a quasi-2D structure made of GeTe buckled
bilayers (BLs). As a consequence, GeTe usually cleaves along the [111]
planes.

The quasi-2D nature of GeTe led some of the present
authors to
speculate that GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs can be grown
on completed quintuple layers of Sb2Te3.13 In addition, because vdW-bonded materials possess
chemically passive surfaces, they were argued to form atomically flat
interfaces,7 further allowing the possibility
of fabricating GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs even by methods
such as sputtering.14,15 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) measurements on such samples demonstrated that they, indeed,
possessed layered structures with vdW gaps separating covalently bonded
blocks.16 The improved performance of iPCM
was attributed to the one-dimensional switching of interfacial Ge
atoms during the phase-change process, which results in decreased
entropic losses compared to a melt-quenched random 3D alloy material,
resulting in significantly better cyclability, faster switching rates,
and reduced power consumption.

The key issues of the proposed
model of phase-change in iPCM can
be summarized as follows. Although the bulk phase of GeTe is ferroelectric,
ultrathin layers of GeTe, in the few monolayer limit, may possess
different structures determined by the overall symmetry of SLs and
also by the need to minimize the surface dipole moment.18,19 Four possible stacking sequences for the GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs were proposed (Figure 1a), namely, the Petrov (P) [··· Te-Ge-Te-Sb-Te-Sb-Te-Ge-Te
···] phase, the Kooi (K) [··· Te-Sb-Te-Ge-Te-Ge-Te-Sb-Te
···] phase (following the commonly used references
to the different proposed structures for the bulk trigonal phases20,21), the inverted Petrov (iP) [Ge-Te ··· Te-Sb-Te-Sb-Te
··· Te-Ge] phase (because the sequence of Ge and Te
planes is inverted), and the ferro(electric) (F) phase [Te-Sb-Te-Sb-Te
··· Te-Ge-Te-Ge], where the ferroelectric structure
of bulk GeTe was preserved. In these notations the ‘-’
sign denotes covalent bonds, whereas the ‘···’
sign corresponds to weaker vdW interaction between chalcogen atoms.
Through MD simulations, it was demonstrated that although at 0 K the
K-phase is the most stable, at elevated temperatures the iP- and F-phases
are energetically more favorable.13 The
conclusion about the reversal of the relative stabilities of the phases
as a function of temperature was subsequently confirmed by a different
group.22

epitaxy (MBE) grown SL. Panels (b) and (c) reflect the experimental
findings of ref 17 and the intermixing mechanism proposed therein. In this and subsequent
figures, Ge atoms are shown in green, Sb atoms in purple, and Te atoms
in orange.

The structural transformations
between these phases were considered
to serve as the mechanism of the phase-change process in iPCM. It
should be noted that following the original proposal of a Ge umbrella
flip as the underlying mechanism for phase-change in composite Ge–Sb–Te
alloys,23 all proposed models centered
around processes that involve Ge atoms, namely, transitions between
F- and iP phases,13 P and iP phases,24 and a transition of Ge atoms between octahedral
and tetrahedral sites25 were proposed.
In an earlier work,22 an additional layer
sliding process was proposed in connection with the F- to iP structure
transformation. In an earlier work,26 it
was noted that because the energy differences between different phases
are rather small, real structures are likely to be mixtures of these
phases and the phase transition may take place locally in places where
the appropriate phases are formed. It was additionally argued that
strain introduced due to the difference in the lattice constants of
GeTe and Sb2Te3 may act to facilitate disordering
of the GeTe phase.27

Subsequently,
TEM studies of GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs
grown by MBE revealed that GeTe blocks were not located between Sb2Te3 blocks as intuitively expected but were instead
incorporated into the Sb2Te3 blocks.17,28,29 Furthermore, it was found that
Ge atoms were located toward the core of the covalently bonded blocks
with Sb atoms located closer to surfaces suggesting strong Ge/Sb intermixing
during the growth (Figure 1b). An additional finding was that the grown structures locally
possessed different stoichiometries. Thus, a nominal Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST225) composition, which is expected
to be built of 9-layer blocks, possessed blocks with the number of
layers varying from 5 to 13, identified as local stoichiometries ranging
from Sb2Te3 to Ge4Sb2Te7 (GST427).28 In other words, vdW-gap-separated
covalent blocks containing a varying number of GeTe bilayers and capped
by SbTe, that is, all located along the quasibinary GeTe/Sb2Te3 tie line, were identified (Figure 1c). These findings strongly challenged the
structures and switching mechanism of the GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattices proposed earlier but at the same time raised
new questions that are very difficult to answer within the proposed
Ge/Sb interdiffusion interpretation of the results.

The first
such question is what is the driving force for the Ge/Sb
plane reversal? The total energies of the Petrov and Kooi phases (i.e.,
phases where Ge atoms are located toward the surfaces and toward the
core of the covalently bonded blocks) are very similar22,30 and thus should not drive the intermixing. What then? In addition,
the activation energies for atomic diffusion are rather large31 and the process should be kinetically limited.
Although we most certainly do not deny the important role of (Ge/Sb
inter)mixing in the growth process, we argue that intermixing alone
cannot possibly provide an explanation for the observed reversal of
Ge and Sb planes (see, e.g., Figure 2d of ref (28) where the outer BLs almost
exclusively contain Sb atoms, whereas Ge atoms are concentrated toward
the core).

The second question relates to the experimentally
observed blocks
with differing numbers of layers. MBE is the most accurate method
to grow solids with well-defined compositions. How can it produce
structures with the local stoichiometry varying so much? In the original
publication, the following statement was provided. “The naturally
occurring stacking faults and layering disorder in the deposited superlattice
seem inconsistent with the high quality that should be achievable
with MBE, but this is another signature that the artificially grown
SL reconfigures into a lower energy state”.17 How does the SL reconfigure? What happens if the growth
process is terminated at, say, the moment indicated by a dashed line
in Figure 1c? Would
the uppermost layer just below the dashed line still have three GeTe
BLs? If the answer is yes, then what is the source of these extra
Ge and Te atoms? If the answer is no and to achieve the ‘lower
energy state’ one has to grow the complete structure shown
in Figure 1c, then
a different question arises. Once the uppermost Ge–Sb–Te
block is formed, how does one GeTe BL migrate downward from there?
Does it tunnel through two Sb2Te3 blocks (leaving
alone SbTe capping layers) as a whole? This does not seem possible.
Do Ge atoms diffuse through the Sb2Te3 phase
without any intermixing? For the case of a strong tendency to intermix,
(i) some of the Ge atoms should remain inside the Sb2Te3 blocks and (ii) such a strong interdiffusion would almost
certainly destroy the SL nature of the sample. Furthermore, such a
long-distance diffusion in a solid phase is bound to be kinetically
limited.

Consequently, although it has rather convincingly been
demonstrated
that the earlier theoretical models of phase change in GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs, such as a transition between the Petrov
and inverted Pertov phases, were oversimplified and possibly incorrect,
the recent experimental results have raised new fundamental questions
that cannot be answered within simple intermixing arguments. In this
work, on the basis of density-functional theory simulations and TEM
imaging (see Methods for details), we propose
an alternative model for the growth of GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs that provides a natural answer to these questions (and which
is fundamentally different from the proposed intermixing idea). We
further propose a conceptually novel mechanism of switching in SLs
that is associated with the inversion of SbTe BLs and the subsequent
reconfiguration of the vdW gaps leading to local deviations in stoichiometry
from the quasibinary tie line. Finally, we demonstrate that Ge/Sb
intermixing, to the extent that it may occur, should not have a noticeable
effect on SL switching performance.

Results and Discussion
To address the issue of the SL growth, we start by noting that
the crucial experimental requirement for the growth of SLs with good
layer orientation using sputtering is the formation of a few nm thick
Sb2Te3 seed layer and it is believed that the
layered nature of Sb2Te3 determines the orientation
of subsequently grown GeTe blocks.32 With
this in mind, we initially simulated the energies (and enthalpies
over an extended temperature range) for a single GeTe BL atop Sb2Te3. The relaxed structures and the comparison
of their enthalpies are shown in Figure 2a. The structure with the Ge plane facing
Sb2Te3 has a significantly lower energy than
that of the alternative configuration, indicating that the first layer
of GeTe grows with the Te plane terminating the surface, which is
also in perfect agreement with the conclusion of a previous work.33 We note that this structure corresponds to the
Petrov termination of a covalent block of trigonal GST. It should
also be noted that the Ge–Te interatomic distances for the
Te-terminated sample are very close to the longer Ge–Te distance
in the bulk GeTe phase, suggesting covalent interaction between the
Sb2Te3 “substrate” and the GeTe
overlayer. The Te–Te distance, on the other hand, is significantly
larger and is closer to the interatomic separation across the vdW
gap.

Figure 2 Relaxed structures and enthalpies for a single GeTe BL (a) and
two GeTe BLs (b) deposited on top of an Sb2Te3 QL. Representative interatomic distances are also shown.

We now proceed to the “growth” of
a second GeTe bilayer.
The existing possibilities and the corresponding enthalpies are shown
in Figure 2b. Interatomic
distances between the different planes are also indicated and suggest
that the overgrown GeTe covalently interacts with Sb2Te3. From comparison of enthalpies, it is clear that the second
layer forms a Ferro phase with a Te-terminated surface.

The
next stage is the growth of an Sb2Te3 QL on
top of a Te-terminated GeTe block, schematically shown in Figure 3. Although it is
natural to assume that Sb2Te3 will form a quintuple
layer (as was assumed in the original work13 and indicated in Figure 3 as path “a”), the situation is actually more
complex. As mentioned above, GeTe is not a proper 2D material. In
other words, the Te-terminated GeTe surface is not as passive as the
Te-terminated surface of Sb2Te3. Indeed, cleaved
GeTe is known to oxidize readily,34 whereas
crystalline Sb2Te3 and other 2D chalcogenides
such as MoS2 are very stable toward oxidation.10 Hence, when the Sb and Te fluxes impinge onto
the GeTe surface, an alternative growth process is possible, namely,
before the Sb2Te3 phase starts to grow, the
GeTe surface is passivated by an inverted SbTe bilayer, transforming
a high-energy surface of a 3D material into a low-energy surface of
a 2D material (path “b”). It is only after this that
the Sb2Te3 phase starts to form. If the fluxes
are supplied for a sufficiently long time, proper quintuple layer(s)
of Sb2Te3 can be formed. If on the other hand
the Sb flux is terminated half way through the formation of a quintuple
layer and the Ge flux is turned on, the growth process continues,
as illustrated in Figure 4, eventually resulting in the formation of a Kooi-like phase.
We note a certain analogy between the formation of reversed SbTe bilayers
and the stacking faults, discussed, for example in ref (31) and ref (39), respectively.

of SL growth. (a) The formation of an Sb2Te3 QL and (b) initial termination of GeTe by an
inverted SbTe BL with subsequent Sb2Te3 growth.
Simulated relative energies of the two structures with different sequences
of Te and Sb atomic planes are compared on the right.

Figure 4 Schematics of the growth of GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs.
Even if the supply of Ge, Sb, and Te species has been adjusted to
grow spatially separated GeTe and Sb2Te3 blocks
(a), in reality, because of the inversion of the initial SbTe BL,
a Kooi-like phase is formed (b).

To determine which of the processes are more likely to take
place,
we compared the total energies of SbTe-terminated GeTe and a TeSb
bilayer (as a seed for a QL) grown on GeTe across a vdW gap. Although
Sb2Te3 has a tendency to form full quintuples,
literature data35−37 suggest that the layer-by-layer growth mode is equally
possible; hence, our simplified approach seems reasonable. The obtained
results show that the former process, that is, the formation of an
inverted SbTe cap layer is energetically more favorable (by ca. 0.2
eV per formula unit) during the layer-by-layer growth. Consequently,
even though the fluxes may be optimized to supply the number of atoms
required to sequentially grow two bilayers of GeTe followed by one
quintuple layer of Sb2Te3 (Figure 4a), in reality the Kooi phase
is formed instead (Figure 4b). The crucial point in the conversion of a GeTe/Sb2Te3 SL into a Kooi-like phase is the fact that the Te-terminated
surface of 3D GeTe is not passive and as such is not suitable for
the growth of a 2D layer using vdW epitaxy, as was intuitively assumed
in the earlier work considering the quasilayered structure of bulk
GeTe.

We note that this process is substantially different from
the Ge
in-diffusion proposed earlier17 to account
for the formation of the Kooi-like phase in lieu of a GeTe/Sb2Te3 SL. We further note that the process proposed
in this work is not in disagreement with the published TEM results.28,29 Indeed, the formation of an SbTe cap on top of two GeTe BLs grown
on an Sb2Te3 QL results in an 11-layer block,
exactly as was reported in the literature.28 In addition, the fact that the upper layer is Sb-rich (consists
of almost exclusively Sb species, as evidenced by the near identical
peak heights for the outermost Te plane and the adjacent plane) is
also in perfect agreement with the result shown in Figure 2d of ref (28) and in disagreement with
the intermixing idea that cannot explain the observed nearly complete
reversal of Ge and Sb planes. One may argue that in the cited work28 an SL with nominally three (as opposed to two)
GeTe BLs was studied and hence the eleven-layer block is inconsistent
with our model. Although this argument cannot be outright dismissed,
we note that during the nominal growth of three GeTe BLs, there were
multiple occurrences where blocks with the number of GeTe BLs within
covalent blocks varied from zero to four28 and hence the composition of each grown block cannot be accurately
predicted.

To conclude this section, we argue that during the
nominal growth
of a GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattice, a Kooi-like phase
is obtained instead due to the 3D nature of GeTe. This result is obtained
not because of Ge/Sb interdiffusion in the solid phase but due to
inversion of the Sb and Te planes during the growth of the first SbTe
bilayer. Because this inversion takes place during the formation of
the first SbTe BL and both Sb and Te species are simultaneously present
in the flux, this process does not require any interatomic diffusion
within the solid phase and consequently is not kinetically limited.

We further studied the stability of GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs assuming that one way or another, an SL with the F-phase can
be formed. We concentrate on the F-phase because this phase has been
consistently predicted13,22 to be energetically most favorable
at elevated temperatures and also because only this phase allows for
a reconstruction into a Kooi-like phase without inversion of Ge/Te
BLs. To this end, we started with the F-phase (Figure 5a), and allowed the Sb2Te3 layer to melt, whereas the GeTe layers were fixed in the
crystalline phase to act as a crystallization template (Sb and Te
atoms are randomly distributed between the two GeTe layers, Figure 5b). We note that
although there is no experimental evidence that this is what happens
in real structures, the higher melting point of GeTe (998 K) compared
with that of Sb2Te3 (893 K) justifies this approach.
Although there may seem to be a contradiction between this assumption
and the results reported in the literature,38 where GeTe was demonstrated to amorphize, whereas Sb2Te3 remained crystalline, this is not the case. In the
cited work, significantly thicker Sb2Te3 blocks
were used, inducing non-negligible tensile strain in GeTe, which was
argued to be the driving force for easier amorphization.

Figure 5 Melting and
recrystallization of the F-phase. (a) The crystalline
Ferro phase at 0 K, (b) melted Sb2Te3 (Te and
Sb atoms are randomly distributed) at 1700 K, (c, d) an onset of recrystallization
(Te and Sb planes are perfectly ordered to form a quintuple layer)
after 46 ps and also after 200 ps at 1300 K.

On the basis of the previous results, we were expecting that
upon
recrystallization, the quintuple layer will break down to terminate
the 3D GeTe slab transforming the F-phase into a Kooi-like phase.
Rather unexpectedly, the quintuple layer was re-established upon recrystallization
(perfect Sb and Te layer ordering can be clearly seen in Figure 5c,d), demonstrating
that the Ferro phase is actually more stable than the Kooi phase at
temperatures close to the melting point. We attribute this result
to the remarkable stability of Sb2Te3 QLs. To
make sure that the obtained result was not an artifact of the fixed
unit cell size, we repeated the simulation, fixing the cell size to
that of the K-phase and obtained the same result: a restoration of
the F-phase upon cooling.

The high stability of the F-phase
suggests that the K- and F-phases
may coexist in proportions determined by the sample prehistory and
a schematic illustration and an experimental indication of this are
shown in Figure 6a,b.
One can clearly see a step in the vdW gap position. With some imagination,
one can see a reversal of Sb and Te planes across the step in the
high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image (Figure 6b).

Figure 6 (a, b) Schematics and a HAADF image of an inverted
Sb2Te3 layer (aka a stacking fault). The red
arrows in the
HAADF image mark the location of vdW gaps. (c, d) E-beam-induced modification
of the layers: (c) before STEM mapping and (d) after STEM mapping.
The numbers written in the figure represent the number of atomic layers
between the vdW gaps. The two red arrows in the left image show the
vdW gaps that disappear after STEM mapping. The blue arrows in the
right figure show the vdW gaps that still remain because this area
is outside of the STEM-mapping region.

Far more interestingly, the vdW gaps can be reconfigured
by external
stimuli, as illustrated in Figure 6c,d. Figure 6c shows an HAADF image of an as-deposited SL. One can see
that in this structure there are blocks with two and five layers separated
by the red arrows. After STEM mapping of the region marked by a red
quadrangle (Figure 6d), the 2 + 5 + 2 layer blocks merge and form a nine-layer block,
as shown in the right panel. The blue arrows in the right panel indicate
the vdW gaps that survived being outside of the mapped region. Presently,
we cannot differentiate unambiguously whether the presence of charge
from the electrons in the beam or the heating effect of the beam caused
the vdW gap motion. The main point we want to make here is that the
vdW gaps in an SL structure are reconfigurable. Furthermore, the provided
images are not meant to serve as a proof of the proposed concept;
they only demonstrate that the existing experimental evidence is in
line with it.

We now want to draw the readers’ attention
to the fact that
switching between the structures shown in Figure 6a (which can also be viewed as the formation
or movement of a stacking fault considered in the literature31) changes the thickness of the covalent blocks
by two atomic layers. This may be significant because in experimentally
grown SLs, thicknesses of individual blocks vary (from 5 to 1328) with an increment of two atomic layers, which
was attributed to a local change in stoichiometry in terms of the
number of GeTe BLs. At the same time, MBE is known to be a very accurate
growth method and it is very difficult to believe that layers of GeTe
containing tens of atoms (for the images shown in the literature28) can easily migrate from inside one covalently
bonded block and inside a neighboring covalently bonded block penetrating
through multiple SbTe layers. Even if variable layer thicknesses may
be thermodynamically favorable, such motion of GeTe layers is bound
to be limited kinetically. On the other hand, the inversion of an
Sb2Te3 QL (stacking fault motion) is much more
realistic and we propose that it is this process and not the variation
in the number of GeTe BLs that causes the different thicknesses of
the covalent blocks observed experimentally.

At this point,
we would like to propose a mechanism for phase change
in SLs associated with the reconfiguration of vdW gaps (similar to
the formation and motion of stacking faults31) described above. Indeed, in the ideal Kooi-like phase, with the
composition corresponding to the GeTe–Sb2Te3 quasibinary tie line, the number of valence electrons and
the number of bonds are such that saturated covalent bonds with two
electrons per bond are formed, resulting in the material being a semiconductor.
In the cubic phase of Ge–Sb–Te, the coexistence of Ge
and Sb necessitates the formation of intrinsic vacancies, as discussed
for example in the literature.39 In SLs,
on the other hand, the overall structure is fixed and there are no
vacancies inside the covalently bonded blocks (they are pushed out
to form vdW gaps). This limitation for the formation of vacancies
has an important consequence.

When an SbTe BL inverts (Figure 7a), one of the blocks
becomes Sb-rich and the other
one becomes Ge-rich, as compared with the quasibinary Kooi phase (with
the appropriate electron count). Because Ge atoms possess four valence
electrons and Sb atoms possess five (Figure 7b), the electron balance necessary to form
saturated covalent bonds is disturbed. (Using an analogy with semiconductor
doping one might say that one of the blocks becomes n-doped, whereas
the other one becomes p-doped. The doping is very heavy because one
out of nine atoms is replaced by a “dopant” for a Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST225) average composition.)
Such “heavily doped” blocks are likely to possess significantly
higher conductivity than that of the “intrinsic” quasibinary
Kooi phase. We propose that this reconfiguration of vdW gaps may be
the origin of the pronounced conductivity contrast between the two
phases that remain crystalline in both states. The end states of this
process can be conceptualized as two correlated atomic zippers working
in opposite directions, as illustrated in the abstract graphic (when
one zipper opens, the other one closes), that is, counterzipping,
the net result of which is a translation of a terminating SbTe bilayer
from one covalently bonded block to the neighboring one. The bilayer
translation is intrinsically linked with inversion of the Sb and Te
planes.

Figure 7 (a) Quasibinary Kooi phase (left) and a phase with inverted SbTe
BLs (right). The upper part shows a single in-plane unit cell and
the bottom panel shows a schematic 3D image of the two phases around
the reconfigured vdW gap; (b) schematics of Ge, Sb, and Te p orbitals,
valence p electrons are shown as arrows; and (c) simulated density
of states around the Fermi level for the quasibinary Kooi (GST225)
phase and the phase with inverted SbTe BLs (GST214 + GST236).

To substantiate this proposal,
we calculated the density of states
of the quasibinary Kooi phase and of a phase with inverted SbTe BLs,
as shown in Figure 7. Our results demonstrate that although the quasibinary Kooi phase
(GST225) essentially possesses a gap (GGA is known to underestimate
the band gap), the phase with the reconfigured gap and local stoichiometries
different from the quasibinary (2GST225 ⇒ GST214 + GST236)
clearly possesses a finite density of states at the Fermi level (Figure 7c), providing a perfect
explanation for the large resistivity contrast between the two phases
despite them both being in a crystalline state. We do not associate
the SET and RESET states directly with pure 2GST225 and (GST214 +
GST236) phases. The only claim made here is that the proposed gap
reconfiguration may lead to dramatic changes in electronic properties.

We do not go into details of the possible atomic scale mechanism
of vdW gap reconfiguration, but one possibility for it may be an umbrella
flip of Sb atoms. We would also like to note that a similar process
of SbTe bilayer reversal (albeit from a solely structural perspective
without any reference to the SL properties) was considered earlier
as stacking fault formation and motion.31 In this work, various microscopic processes within SbTe BLs resulting
in SbTe reversal were considered and we believe that similar processes
may take place during the phase-change process. We also note that
the energy cost of such SbTe BL inversion translation is relatively
low.31

The proposed phase-change
mechanism is substantially different
from earlier models in that previously only Ge motion was considered,
whereas the motion of Sb atoms was entirely, and undeservedly, neglected.
Even if this Ge motion could lead to a similar gap reconfiguration
(e.g., a transition between the P- and F-phases may be considered
as a transfer of a GeTe bilayer from one GST225 block to another,
that is, 2GST225 ⇒ GST124 + GST326), this would change the
local stoichiometry of blocks but would not cause a deviation from
the quasibinary composition, a condition necessary to ensure the formation
of saturated covalent bonds, consequently causing no change in the
electronic properties. For the density of states at the Fermi level
to change, a local deviation from the quasibinary compositions of
covalently bonded blocks, achieved due to SbTe BLs inversion, is crucial.
At the same time, it should be stressed that the proposed model is
similar to the initial key idea13 in that
the phase change in SLs is due to one-dimensional motion of cation
atoms located in the vicinity of vdW gaps.

We further note that
Ge/Sb intermixing does not compromise the
proposed model, provided there is a sufficient number of Sb atoms
in inverting BLs. Experimental evidence demonstrates that, fortunately,
this is generally the case.17,28,29

The main findings of this work can be summarized as follows.

Contrary to the previously proposed models of Ge/Sb intermixing
based on Ge in-diffusion into Sb2Te3 QLs with
concomitant Sb atoms’ out-diffusion, our results suggest that
the reversal of the expected Ge and Sb planes occurs as a result of
the 3D nature of GeTe that requires surface termination by an SbTe
BL for the subsequent vdW growth to proceed. The proposed model does
not require atomic diffusion within a solid phase and hence is energetically
significantly more favorable.

We propose that covalently bonded
blocks with different thicknesses
form in SLs not as a result of GeTe plane redistribution between different
covalently bonded blocks, which requires significant atomic diffusion,
but are caused by detachment/reattachment of SbTe BLs, analogous to
the motion of stacking faults, a process that requires significantly
less diffusion.

We demonstrate that at temperatures close to
the melting point,
an Sb2Te3 QL in the vicinity of GeTe is very
stable and re-forms after melting, whereas at low temperatures (0
K in our simulation), the formation of a Kooi-like phase is energetically
more favorable. We propose that this reversal of the phase stability
plays an important role in the phase-change process in SLs.

More specifically, we associate the phase-change mechanism in SLs
with the reconfiguration of vdW gaps through the inversion of SbTe
BLs between neighboring blocks. We showed that the quasibinary (Kooi)
structure is a gapped phase, whereas a structure built of blocks with
inverted SbTe BLs possesses a finite density of states at the Fermi
level and we argue that this transition, accompanied by a local deviation
in stoichiometry from quasibinary compositions, is the origin of phase-change
in GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs. A very important feature
of the proposed model is that it is not compromised by Ge/Sb intermixing.
We also note that the proposed model does not affect the original
explanation of the superior efficiency of SL-based memories offered
in terms of one-dimensional motion of cation atoms.

The reported
results represent significant progress in understanding
the structure and switching mechanism in GeTe/Sb2Te3 SLs and open a new avenue for the industrial development
of GeTe/Sb2Te3 SL-based memory devices based
on insightful engineering of van der Waals gaps. Furthermore, we believe
that the proposed concept of vdW gap reconfiguration as a means to
control the properties of vdW-bonded layered materials may be more
general and applicable to the broad class of vdW solids beyond iPCM.

Methods
First-principles calculations were carried out using the pseudopotential
plane-wave density-functional theory formalism using the Vienna ab
initio simulation package (VASP) code.40 Projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials that included the
electron configurations 3d 4s 4p, 5s 5p, and 5s 5p as valence states
for Ge, Sb, and Te, respectively, were used. The PBE exchange-correlation
functional41 was used with a plane-wave
basis, with a cutoff energy of 500 eV. A 6 × 6 × 2 gamma-centered
Monkhorst–Pack grid was used to sample the Brillioun zone of
the conventional cell.42 The PAW projections
were conducted in a reciprocal space, and nonspherical contributions
to the gradient corrections within the PAW spheres were included.
Calculations were carried out in the scalar relativistic approximation
and spin–orbit coupling was not included. Van der Waals forces
were accounted for by using the DFT-D2 dispersion correction of Grimme.43 To simulate surface properties, a 15 Å
vacuum gap was introduced between periodic replicas along the growth
direction.

Lattice dynamics calculations were carried out using
a combination
of Phonopy44 and VASP using density-functional
perturbation theory (DFPT). The conventional cell was relaxed using
a tolerance of 10–8 eV for the electronic minimization
and both ion positions and the lattice were relaxed until the forces
were less than 3 × 10–4 eV/Å. The DFPT
calculations were carried out using 2 × 2 × 1 supercells
to account for extended forces, and the resulting phonon density of
states were sampled using a 128 × 128 × 128 gamma-centered q grid with respect to the reciprocal space form of the conventional
cell to derive the partition function used for the calculation of
the enthalpy. The enthalpy was calculated in terms of the energy per
formula unit.

Molecular dynamics simulations of the Ferro phase
were performed
for an NVT ensemble of 36 atoms, with lattice constants corresponding
to the relaxed Ferro and Kooi phases at 0 K corrected for higher temperatures
using the experimental values of the thermal expansion of trigonal
Ge2Sb2Te5.45 GeTe bilayers were fixed at the top and bottom of the cell, as described
in the text. A Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat was employed
and a gamma-centered 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid
was used for k-space sampling, with an energy cutoff of 250 eV. The
molten phase was obtained by maintaining a temperature of 1700 K for
200 ps ensuring the equilibrium molten state was reached. The temperature
of the structure was subsequently decreased to 1300 K in 100 ps, and
the temperature was maintained at 1300 K for another 200 ps. The onset
of subsequent recrystallization at 1300 K (plane ordering) was noted
at 46 ps, which continued to 200 ps. The DFT-D2 dispersion correction
was applied throughout.

The GeTe/Sb2Te3 superlattices used in this
work were fabricated using helicon sputtering. The films were grown
on Si single crystal wafers, where the native oxide of the substrate
was preliminarily removed by Ar reverse sputtering. A 3 nm thick Sb2Te3 seed layer was grown first at room temperature,
followed by heating up the substrate to 230 °C. The superlattices
were fabricated by depositing GeTe and Sb2Te3 layers alternately. The growth rates used were 5.5 nm/min (GeTe)
and 4.6 nm/min (Sb2Te3).

TEM specimens
were prepared by mechanical polishing, followed by
Ar-ion beam milling (Dual Mill 600; Gatan, Inc.). The cross-sectional
microstructures were observed by STEM (JEM-ARM200F, JEOL Co. Ltd).
The acceleration voltage was 200 kV. The probe size was 2 Å,
and the probe current was 60 pA. The total acquisition time for energy-dispersive
system mapping was about 20 min, with a dwell time of 15 μs.
