There is a huge variability in reducing
sugars, viscosity, and
composition of oligosaccharides in the hydrolyzed products of konjac
flour with different concentrations. We analyzed the factors affecting
reducing sugars, viscosity, and the average degree of polymerization
(DP) during the preparation of oligosaccharides from konjac flour
hydrolyzed by β-mannanase under the high-concentration solute
hydrolysis model. Hydrolysate of konjac flour, using concentrations
ranging from 50 to 200 g/L, was directly added into 20 U/mL of β-mannanase
solution. The results showed that when the proportion of the water
content in the solution decreased, the viscosity of the solution and
the DP of polysaccharides changed significantly. When the viscosity
of the hydrolysate was controlled within the range of 30–20
mPa·s, the concentration of the reducing sugars was maintained
in the range of 9–13 g/L and the average DP of the polysaccharides
was controlled in the range of 2.42–9.78. We also found that
a high concentration of hydrolysate was beneficial for decreasing
the production of reducing sugars, and the diversification of macromolecular
glycan was beneficial to the preparation of functional sugars. Moreover,
we observed that the proportion of reducing sugars with free water
content was high and that the preparation of oligosaccharides via
the high-concentration solid-state method increased product diversity.

Introduction
Konjac oligosaccharides are a mixture
of small-molecule polymers
containing 2–20 sugar rings,1 which
are linear micromolecular glycans with d-mannose and d-glucose linked through β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.2,3 Konjac oligosaccharides are an essential class of functional oligosaccharides,
are used to treat constipation, suppress cancer cells, and improve
gut microbes.4−10 Konjac oligosaccharides are prepared from konjac flour, and the
primary treatment methods are often used in enzymatic hydrolysis,11−14 acid hydrolysis,15 and microwave deposition.16 Konjac flour is a polysaccharide; its aqueous
solution has high-viscosity characteristics, enzyme protein has been
adsorbed easily, and the activity of glycoside hydrolase would be
weakened. Therefore, for the enzymatic hydrolysis, konjac flour with
a concentration of less than 50 g/L is used to form konjac gum after
swelling, which is followed by the addition of hemicellulase for the
degradation of glucomannan of konjac flour.17,18 Because the konjac flour used for hydrolysis is of low solute concentration,
a large amount of reducing aldose is produced during the hydrolysis
process, and the average degree of polymerization (DP) of the polysaccharide
is low. The finished product is a combination of monosaccharides with
2–4 sugar rings. The low-concentration liquid enzymatic hydrolysis
treatment method19,20 was used in many previous studies.
However, such a method is less efficient and is not conducive to industrial
preparation. Therefore, in enzymatic hydrolysis of the high-concentration
konjac solution, konjac flour has difficulties in swelling, such that
the water-soluble gum substance becomes solid without fluidity.21−23 This type of hydrolysis leads to a small contact surface of the
enzyme and a low hydrolysis rate. Besides, the yield of the enzymatic
hydrolysate is influenced by the high viscosity of the konjac gum,
which is not conducive to the catalysis of mannanase.

In the
process of enzymatic hydrolysis, the traditional method,
konjac flour was first prepared in an aqueous solution, and then the
enzyme solution was added. Moreover, in this study, we used the reverse
method and directly added konjac flour to the acidic mannanase solution
to form a semisolid viscous shape, which was further hydrolyzed at
60 °C to form a concentrated hydrolysate. In this paper, the
hydrolysis and product composition of konjac flour were analyzed in
a high-concentration hydrolysis model.

Results and Analysis
Analysis
of the Viscosity of Konjac Flour and Konjac Flour Hydrolysate
Konjac flour was dissolved in water to form a high-viscosity konjac
flour solution, which had poor fluidity and was considered a non-Newtonian
type of fluid.24 Once the konjac flour
was under high-concentration conditions in the reaction tank, a high-viscosity
solution was obtained. The sediment was muddy and without fluidity,
and it was difficult to stir. If a lot of manganase protein is absorbed
by konjac flour and can not thoroughly mixed, the affinity of the
enzyme to the substrate is significantly weakened, leading to low
catalytic efficiency and weak hydrolysis reaction, which is not conducive
to the enzymatic hydrolysis
process. The design of the hydrolysis process can be facilitated by
understanding how the viscosity of konjac raw materials influences
the fluidity analysis. Figure 1A shows the viscosity curve of konjac flour as different concentrations
of konjac flour were dissolved in water and measured by a viscometer.
When the low-concentration low quantity of konjac flour was dissolved
into a water solution, the viscosity of solution was low and was easy
to stir. Besides, with increasing konjac flour concentration, the
viscosity of the solution would also increase, showing a positive
correlation. Thus, the viscosity of the konjac gum at a concentration
of 20 g/L was higher than 100,000 mPa·s, and no fluidity was
observed.

During the traditional process of enzymatic hydrolysis, konjac
gum is formed by preformulation, and then the enzyme solution is added
for enzymatic hydrolysis. This traditional method is only suitable
with a low concentration of the substrate. Konjac easily cross-links
with metal ions under alkaline conditions. It forms a gel-like precipitate,
which is not conducive to the binding of the active site of the enzyme,
resulting in degradation difficulty. Several studies have reported
using a low concentration of konjac flour to form konjac gum via swelling,
followed by hydrolysis.20,25,26 The finished products have a high hydrolysis percentage, long consumption
time, and a single product.

To improve the hydrolysis efficiency
and concentration of hydrolyzed
products, we adopted the enzymatic hydrolysis technology of the high-concentration
substrate. By adding konjac flour to the enzyme solution, β-mannanase
cleaved the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds of glucomannan in konjac
gum to form small-molecule glycans and reduce the viscosity of polysaccharides. Figure 1B–E shows
the change in viscosity during the β-mannanase-induced hydrolysis
of konjac flour (at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 g/L).
The concentrations of konjac flour in Figure 1B,C were 50 and 100 g/L, respectively. The
unit enzyme protein degradation of konjac powder was less (bearing
ratio η small), a high hydrolysis rate was obtained, and the
viscosity decreased rapidly—the viscosity decreased to 3.5–9
mPa·s within 15 min. At a concentration of 150–200 g/L,
the hydrolysis viscosity was controlled below 30 mPa·s, and the
hydrolysis reaction took longer than 60 min (Figure 1D,E). We found that the time required for
the viscosity to reach 15 mPa·s was much lower than that required
for the enzymatic hydrolysis to produce small-molecule monosaccharides.
When the viscosity decreased to a certain threshold, the viscosity
changed very slowly as the reaction time increased, but the concentration
of monosaccharides increased. Therefore, timely control of viscosity
is conducive to the control of monosaccharide production.

The
process of combining konjac flour with the enzyme solution
for hydrolysis and dissolution was analyzed. As shown in Figure 1F–I, 2 kg
of konjac flour (200 g/L) was added to 10 L of enzyme solution (konjac
flour concentration 200 g/L), and the swelling rate of the konjac
flour was higher than the enzymatic hydrolysis rate. The konjac flour
swelled and quickly became solid and viscous (Figure 1F). The enzyme protein was encapsulated in
the water-swollen konjac flour. After 5 min, the konjac flour became
semisolid, the amount of free water increased, the crude fiber began
to peel off, and the soluble sugars separated (Figure 1G); after 30 min of enzymatic hydrolysis,
the semisolid konjac flour was degraded into a liquid state, which
could be agitated and had a certain fluidity (Figure 1H); over time, the change in viscosity became
minimal. The viscosity after 60 min did not change substantially;
it remained within the range of 60–30 mPa·s (Figure 1I). Thus, in the
hydrolysis process of high-concentration konjac flour, a small amount
of konjac flour can be added several times to maintain the hydrolysis
viscosity in a low-viscosity state, which is conducive to equipment
stirring.

Correlation Analysis of Reducing Sugars and Average DP during
Enzymatic Hydrolysis
The hydrolysis of konjac flour was accompanied
by the production of reducing sugars, which are mostly monosaccharides,
and higher concentrations of monosaccharides affect the yield of oligosaccharides.
The concentration of reducing sugars reflected the degree of hydrolysis
of konjac flour, the rate of hydrolysis, and the average DP of the
polysaccharides. In this paper, the enzymatic hydrolysis process was
carried out at 60 °C. β-mannanase cleaved the β-1,4-linked
glycosidic bonds, which was accompanied by the production of a large
amount of d-glucose, d-mannose, and aldose with
reducing ends. In Figure 2A, the hydrolysis viscosity was controlled at 30 mPa·s;
reducing sugars occurred more in the hydrolysis products of konjac
flour at low concentrations but less in the hydrolysis products of
konjac flour at high concentrations. By measuring the reducing sugar
in the solution of each concentration (Figure 2B), we found that the concentration of reducing
sugars formed by hydrolysis with different concentrations of konjac
flour was maintained within the range of 9–13 g/L. When converted
into reducing sugars per gram of raw materials, the number of reduced
monosaccharides released per gram of konjac flour by high-concentration
hydrolysis was only 70 mg. Still, the monosaccharides released by
the low-concentration konjac flour hydrolysis solution could reach
227 mg/(g raw materials).

the reducing sugar of certain concentrations can inhibit the further
catalysis of the enzyme. (C) Relationship between reducing sugars,
DP, and reaction rate. (D) Yield rate of reducing sugars yield rate

As shown in Figure 2C, in the hydrolysis system with 200 g/L of konjac flour, the enzyme
activity in the solution was 20 U/mL. When adding konjac flour to
form a concentration of 50 g/L, because per unit enzyme protein bearing
konjac flour was 1.25 mg, the hydrolysis process was quickly completed
in a short time. Each gram of raw material could release 282 mg of
reducing sugars, and the average DP was 2.41. In the 200 g/L high-concentration
konjac flour hydrolysate, the per unit enzyme protein bearing konjac
flour was 5 mg, the reducing sugars produced was only 70 mg/(g raw
material), and the average DP of hydrolysis was 9.78.

When konjac
flour was added to the enzyme solution, the solvent
water was involved in the adsorption reaction of konjac flour. As
the amount of konjac flour increased, the hydrolysis solution changed
from the diluted state to the concentrated state and semisolid state.
Thus, the high-concentration konjac aqueous solution, with a decreased
amount of water, influenced the catalytic ability of the enzyme, thereby
inhibiting the degradation rate of reducing sugars (Figure 2D).

Therefore, when konjac
flour was added to the enzyme solution,
the 1 U enzyme bearing the weight of konjac flour was less, and the
hydrolysis process was quickly completed. As a result, a large amount
of reducing sugar has been produced. With the increase in konjac flour,
the enzyme protein load increased, and hydrolysis was incomplete,
more so in the macromolecular material cleavage stage, producing less
reducing sugar. Therefore, by artificially controlling the viscosity
of the hydrolysate at 30 mPa·s, we were able to maintain the
reducing sugar content at a concentration of 9–13 g/L. Moreover,
by controlling the corresponding enzyme activity in the raw material,
the catalytic direction of the enzyme was able to be regulated, and
the ratio of the reducing sugar formed could be effectively controlled.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis of the Hydrolysate
Figure 3A–C
shows the composition of the enzymatic hydrolysate of konjac flour
at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 g/L. Small-molecule glycan products
were identified according to the molecular fragment peak, and hydrolysis
products formed at different concentrations were searched according
to the multiple of 162 Da differences between each sugar molecule;
results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that few types of hydrolytic products were formed
in 50 g/L konjac flour, whereas more types of hydrolytic products
were formed when the concentration was more significant than 100 g/L.
The types and percentages of oligosaccharides were analyzed according
to the peak area ratio of the primary structure mass spectra of the
konjac products in Figure 3. In Figure 3D, in the hydrolysate with a low concentration of konjac flour (50
g/L), the formed products were mainly mannose, DP-2 (disaccharide),
and DP-3 (trisaccharide) because of excessive hydrolysis. According
to the statistical calculation of the peak area of each sugar molecule,
it was found that disaccharides were 65% of the formed product; in
the hydrolysate with a high concentration of 100 g/L konjac flour,
the oligosaccharides were mainly DP-2 (disaccharides) to DP-5 (pentasaccharides),
and the proportion of DP-3 (trisaccharides) was the highest (21%).
The oligosaccharide formed from the hydrolysate of 200 g/L konjac
flour showed two gradient hydrolysis processes. The products in the
first gradient were DP-2 to DP-10 glycoside polymers with a content
of 46.8%, and the proportion of DP-3 (trisaccharides) was 15%. The
products in the second gradient were DP-11 to DP-18 with a content
of 53.2%, of which DP-11 accounted for 20%.

Discussion
In
this study, we analyzed the relationship between reducing sugars,
viscosity, and DP during the process of preparing oligosaccharides
from konjac flour hydrolyzed by acidic β-mannanase. A reverse
addition method was adopted in this study, and as such, an enzyme
solution with a specific concentration was pre-prepared, and then
konjac flour was added to the enzyme solution. In the early stage,
because of excessive enzymes and rapid hydrolysis, the hydrolysis
rate was higher than the swelling rate of the konjac flour, and the
konjac flour was dissolved into the enzyme solution and hydrolyzed
continuously. The macromolecular substance gradually became a small
molecular substance. As shown in the following enzymatic hydrolysis
phase, as the reaction time increased, glucomannan was gradually hydrolyzed
into sugar monosaccharides of different molecular weights. During
the entire reaction process, a large amount of water was needed for
the chemical reaction. During the swelling phase of konjac flour,
water was also needed, and micromolecular glucomannan had been formed
through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.

Konjac flour
was added to the reaction system containing the enzyme
solution for the dissolution and hydrolysis of konjac flour. The reaction
system used in the experiment was in an acidic environment of pH 5.5,
and konjac flour was added to the enzyme solution, resulting in a
solution concentration of 200 g/L of konjac flour. The swelling rate
of konjac flour was still higher than the enzymatic rate, and konjac
flour swelled and rapidly turned into wet flour (Figure 1D). Although the acidic environment
reduced the swelling ability of the konjac glucomannan,27 the concentration of konjac flour was too high,
resulting in a solid viscous state. The enzyme was encapsulated in
the konjac flour swollen with water and became semisolid after 5 min.
The amount of free water increased, the crude fiber began to peel
off, and soluble sugars were separated (Figure 1E). After 30 min of enzymatic hydrolysis,
the semisolid konjac flour was degraded into a liquid state, which
could be agitated and had a certain fluidity (Figure 1F). Over time, there was a minimal change
in viscosity, which was maintained within the range of 20–30
mPa·s.

Considering the water content of the reaction system,
the weight
of the solids in the reaction system was 20% (w/v), and the free water
in the reaction system was relatively small, which was not conducive
to the migration of free enzymes. Besides, the process of the konjac
flour absorbing water to form konjac flour involved the combination
of physical and chemical processes. Numerous water molecules were
required for consumption. The chemical process of the combination
of konjac flour and water was destroyed by the enzymatic hydrolysis
method, resulting in the release of a large number of water molecules,
which were then involved in the reaction of small molecular sugars,
thus destroying the powerful absorbing properties of konjac flour
toward the water. It was also found that the amount of reducing sugars
with free-water content was high. Therefore, the preparation of oligosaccharides
by a high-concentration solid-state method was beneficial to the diversity
of products and the reduction of the proportion of monosaccharides.

While studying the enzymatic preparation of konjac oligosaccharides,
we demonstrated that the amount of reducing aldose formed by excessive
enzymes was high, and the DP value was low. As the concentration of
the substrate increased, the concentration of the solute increased,
the bearing ratio η of the enzyme solution also increased, and
the hydrolysis rate decreased. The hydrolysis process, in which macromolecules
were cleaved to form small molecular substances, required the involvement
of plenty of free water in the enzyme reaction. Once the concentration
of free water decreased, it would affect the hydrolysis rate of small
molecular substances being further degraded into monosaccharides,
and the proportion of monosaccharides formed was not high. As shown
in Figures 2D and 3, in a 50 g/L konjac flour solution, the concentration
of solute formed was 5%, whereas the concentration of solvent water
was 95%, which is beneficial to the catalysis function of the enzymes
and can maintain the activity of the glycoside hydrolase. During the
process of high-concentration enzymatic hydrolysis, the combination
of konjac flour and water formed konjac gum, and water could bind
to small-molecule sugars formed by the hydrolysis of glycans as a
ligand. Once free water was not available, the catalytic activity
of the enzyme was altered, limiting further cleavage of glycosidic
bonds, and the proportion of macromolecular substances was high.

Therefore, to obtain a high concentration of konjac oligosaccharides
and reduce the monosaccharides in the production process, the viscosity
of enzymatic hydrolysate must be controlled. A high-concentration
solute is conducive to reducing free water in the reaction system,
effectively controlling DP, and high-quality konjac oligosaccharides
can be obtained.

Experimental Section
Materials
First-level
konjac flour was purchased from
Yuyuan Food Corporation (Lijiang, Kunming, China). β-Mannanase
(8000 ± 400 U/g), with a protein molecular weight of 44–62
kDa and an isoelectric point of 0.75, was purchased from Qactive Biotechnology
(Kunming, Yunnan, China). 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) was obtained
from Lanji Technology Development (Shanghai, China), and phenol was
obtained from Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technology (Tianjin, China).
All other reagents were produced in China and were of analytical grade
purity.

Determination of β-Mannanase Activity
The konjac
gum substrate (5 g/L) was prepared using a 0.2 M dipotassium hydrogen
phosphate–citric acid buffer solution (pH 5.5). Konjac gum
substrate (1.8 mL) was added into two sample tubes and one blank tube
and preheated in a 60 °C water bath for 5 min. The diluted β-mannanase
solution (0.2 mL) was then added to the sample tubes. After 30 min,
3 mL of DNS reagent28 was added to each
tube. Additionally, a diluted β-mannanase solution (0.2 mL)
was added to the blank tube. All tubes were placed in boiling water
for 5 min and cooled, and then, 10 mL of distilled water was added.
After mixing, the reaction liquid was colorized on a spectrophotometer
with a colorimetric wavelength of 540 nm. The enzymatic activity of
the solution was extrapolated from a standard curve of reducing sugar.
An enzyme unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to
hydrolyze konjac gum (5 g/L) to produce 1 μmol of mannose at
pH 5.5 and 60 °C.

Determination of Reducing Sugar Products
Konjac gum
was hydrolyzed by acidic β-mannanase, and the hydrolyzed oligosaccharide
product was appropriately diluted 10-fold with distilled water. The
diluted oligosaccharide solution (0.2 mL) was added into a test tube,
and 3 mL of DNS reagent was added. The mixture was placed in a boiling
water bath for 5 min. Then, water was added to bring the reaction
volume to 15 mL. Colorimetric analysis was performed to calculate
the reducing sugar content29 in the enzymatic
hydrolysate. We used the following equation to calculate the percentage
of conversion of reducing sugars 1  

Determination of the Average DP of Enzymatic Hydrolysate
The average DP refers to the ratio of the total sugar content30 of konjac flour to the amount of reducing sugar
in the enzymatic hydrolysate. The closer the value is to 1, the more
thorough the hydrolysis is. We used the following equation to calculate
the average DP 2  

Effect of Viscosity on the Fluidity of Konjac
Flour and Konjac
Hydrolysate
Konjac flour (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4,
1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 g) was added to 100 mL of 60 °C water and mixed
evenly with a magnetic stir bar. After 1 h, the solution was swollen
and mixed uniformly, and then, the solution was cooled to room temperature
(25 °C). The viscosity was measured using a rotor viscometer
(NDJ-8S, Shanghai LICHEN-BX Technology Co., Ltd., China). Rotor no.
1 was required to determine the low viscosity, and rotor no. 4 was
required to determine the high viscosity. Maintaining the temperature
of the konjac gum solution at 25 °C, the rotor was put into the
konjac gum solution. The drive device enabled the rotor to rotate
steadily for 3 min and scale range to reach 50%, and the viscosity
value was read.

Next, 1.25 g of β-mannanase flour was
added into 500 mL of 60 °C hot water and mixed evenly; the β-mannanase
activity in the solution was 20 U/mL. Four triangular flasks were
placed in a water bath, each bottle was filled with 125 mL of the
enzyme solution, and the temperature was kept at 60 °C for 5
min. Konjac flour (5, 10, 15, and 20 g) was added to the enzyme solution.
The solutions were magnetically mixed to form 50, 100, 150, and 200
g/L konjac flour solutions. The viscosity of the hydrolysis solution
was monitored every 5 min. The reducing sugar content was determined
when the viscosity of each concentration gradient was between 15 and
30 mPa·s. The experiment was repeated three times to obtain the
experimental average.

Hydrolytic Product Analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS
The concentrated
sample of konjac oligosaccharides was diluted fivefold, and the total
soluble sugar concentration was controlled at 40 g/L. The diluted
sample and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution were mixed on
the MALDI plate at a 1:1 ratio and then dried at room temperature.
The composition of oligosaccharides was analyzed using a MALDI TOF
mass spectrometer . The instrument was ionized by MALDI, and a total
of 10,000–20,000 laser emissions were obtained for each mass
spectrum. The mass spectrum was collected by the hyperspectral MALD-TOF
(Bruker Daltonics, Inc.) mass spectrometer in cation mode.

Statistical
Analysis
Results are shown as the means
of three biological replicates, and the error bars indicate the standard
deviation. The statistical significance of the results was evaluated
using Student’s t-test. Correlation analysis
was performed using Spearman correlation analysis (SPSS 19.0). Origin
8.5 software was used for preparing graphs and data processing.
