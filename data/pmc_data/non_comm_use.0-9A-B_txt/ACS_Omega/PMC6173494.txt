Blood
is a complex multiphase fluid exhibiting pronounced shear-thinning
and viscoelastic behavior. By studying the formation of blood droplets
through simple dripping, we observe blood-drop detachment following
a neck formation and subsequent thinning until breakup, similar to
that of other liquids. Our experimental findings reveal that it exhibits
two distinct modes of neck evolution characteristics; one mode corresponds
to incessant collapsing of the liquid neck, whereas the other mode
correlates thinning of an extended long thread leading to the breakup.
We show that the two modes of neck evolution closely follow the theory
of pinch-off for shear-thinning and viscoelastic fluids independent
of hematocrit concentration in the range of healthy individuals. Furthermore,
we observe that the relaxation time scales are very similar to that
of plasma; this explains the key role of plasma proteins to blood
rheology. We envision that our results are likely to bear far-reaching
implications in understanding the contribution of plasma proteins
to the rheology of blood and theory of drop formation of complex non-Newtonian
fluids.

Introduction
Understanding the drop
formation characteristics for different
fluids, including both Newtonian and non-Newtonian, has been realized
over the last few decades.1−6 Formation of a neck and its subsequent thinning until breakup commonly
earmarks the course of droplet detachment in a wide range of scenarios.
In complex fluids, intriguing morphological characteristics can be
observed.7−11 Despite rigorous efforts that have been made toward conceptualizing
the droplet detachment processes for fluids with various levels of
complexities, common consensus on the physics of blood-drop detachment
is yet to be clearly understood. Blood is known to be a heterogeneous
suspension of many different cells, proteins, and other small bioanalytes.
This leads to intriguing fluidic behavior of blood at different flow
conditions, attributed to cellular interactions, hematocrit, plasma
chemistry, and so forth.12−15 Because of the presence of live biological entities
within blood, the interactions are far from being trivial,16−20 as compared to the entities suspended in other known complex polymeric
fluids. There are indeed experimental evidences, which show that even
the blood plasma has an elastic property, because of the interactions
of the plasma proteins, which play a dominant role during neck thinning
and breakup in elongational flows.12,13

The
entire process from the neck instigation to the droplet detachment
during the breakup event is known as the pinch-off process. From a
quantitative perspective, the evolution of the neck diameter, dneck, of the droplet as a function of the time
remaining to droplet detachment, τ, is the key focus in the
observation of any pinch-off process. Fluidic complexities enter into
the picture and an interplay of the capillary, viscous, and inertial
forces decide the relationship between dneck and τ. The phenomenon has been extensively studied for the
case of Newtonian fluids.1,2,21,22 However, the pinch-off of non-Newtonian
fluids depends strongly on respective rheological characteristics
and thus makes the pinch-off dynamics more interesting.4,5,8,10,23−25 Orientation, clustering,
and deformation of the suspended moieties in the blood sample, as
well as a combined viscous and elastic nature of the same, impart
several complexities toward analyzing blood at pinch. This may be
further complicated by the age and health of the concerned subject.
Therefore, it necessitates a comprehensive investigation of the physical
features occurring over the neck region during blood-drop formation,
with an interplay of the diverse and complex rheological features.

Here, we present the flow physics of blood pinch-off, through simple
experiments of dripping pendent drop from a tube. We observe two distinct
modes of pinch-off, which closely follow the breakup dynamics of shear-thinning
and viscoelastic fluids. Fundamentally, these originate from the intricate
dynamics of the included blood cells and proteins that are suspended
in the plasma matrix. The extended mode of breakup of blood is very
similar to that of plasma solution, and the relaxation time scales
are of the same order. These results can be of particular significance
to develop theoretical understandings for the formation of blood droplets
and their correlation with blood rheology.

Results and Discussion
Qualitative and quantitative depiction of the pinch-off characteristics
of a representative human blood sample is shown in Figure 1. Two distinct modes of pinch-off
can be identified: (i) incessant neck collapsing mode and (ii) extended
thread breakup mode. It is worth mentioning that there are stringent
dynamic differences, as we shall see. To appreciate this principle,
we provide the Supporting Information Movie for comprehensive visualization. Toward quantitative assessment,
we present the dneck evolution as a function
of τ, for both the modes mentioned above. Our analysis is focused
over dneck ≈ 10–4 to 10–5 m (which is also the minimum achievable
length scale by using our experimental setup). Studies have shown
that the final stage for thinning of complex fluids, even with blood
plasma, resides over the neck diameter around 10–4 to 10–5 m. Thus, we specifically analyze the thinning
behavior over this regime.

Figure 1 Pinch-off of a falling pendent drop of blood
from tube. Two modes
of pinch-off, as observed in the present experiments, are shown: (i)
incessant neck collapsing mode (shown for HCT 41.0%) and (ii) extended
thread breakup mode (shown for HCT 39.5%). Dynamic visualization of
the pinch-off processes are provided in the Supporting Information (Movie and corresponding documentation). Corresponding
quantitative depiction is provided through the evolution of the neck
diameter dneck in the time remaining to
pinch-off τ. The definition of dneck is also provided in the figure for comprehension.

Mode (i) corresponds to the formation of a neck
region, which keeps
on collapsing until pinch-off and droplet detachment. From the dneck – τ data, shown in log–log
plot in Figure 1, one
can appreciate a power law-type relation dneck ∝ τα (with α being the power
law exponent) for mode (i) breakup near the point of droplet detachment
(evident from nearly linear graph in log–log plot). For Newtonian
fluids, α is typically either 2/3 or 1 depending on whether
the near-pinch-off behavior corresponds to potential flow theory (α
= 2/3) or inertial–viscous flow theory (α = 1).2 For non-Newtonian fluids, however, usually α
= n, where n is the power law index,
whereas the rheological behavior is modeled as power law fluid.4,24 For blood pinch-off we also note α = n for
the mode (i) pinch-off behavior, as we shall see.

It is important
to note that the breakup of viscoelastic fluids
is predominantly elongational during the later stage of pinch-off.
Under such circumstances, long extension of fluid neck can be observed
prior to breakup, for fluids having flexible higher molecular weight
polymers.8 The polymers undergo stretching
in the elongational flow at the later stage of pinch-off and subsequently
lead to exponential thinning of the neck.8 This is pertaining to the viscoelastic rheology of the complex fluid.
In our experiment with human blood, the mode (ii) breakup corresponds
to such behavior. Thus, it seems that the flexible proteins and polymers
suspended in blood play a vital role during blood pinch-off.

It is worth mentioning that the rheology of the fluid plays a pivotal
role in deciding the near-pinch-off behavior.11,26−31 However, with the existence of different neck-thinning behavior
in blood, as shown in Figure 1, a question seems obvious: what rheological behavior of blood
should be considered near pinch-off? The abundant presence of red
blood cells (RBCs) pertains to shear thinning rheology of blood, which
is often described through power law model. The plasma matrix, however,
has interesting rheological characteristics. In shear flow, it exhibits
Newtonian behavior; in elongational flow, such as drop breakup scenario,
plasma can exhibit viscoelastic behavior.12 From our experiments it is evident that even in elongational flow
during pinch-off, blood can exhibit either shear thinning or viscoelastic
behavior.

It is well known that blood exhibits a combination
of shear thinning
and viscoelastic behavior.15,20,32,33 RBCs form clusters at low shear
rates, known as rouleaux.19 Plasma proteins,
especially fibrinogen, plays a vital role in the formation of these
aggregates. The shear-thinning behavior of blood is a consequence
of this aggregation behavior leading to higher viscosities at low
shear rates. However, at moderate to high shear rates (>10 s–1), the rouleaux structures start to break down, thereby
decreasing
viscosity and exhibiting a shear-thinning behavior.34 It is believed that these rouleaux structures can be stretched
and deformed, which gives an elastic behavior to the blood. Nevertheless,
at shear rates close to 10 s–1 or less, blood shows
a more prominent viscous behavior than an elastic behavior.

As the shear rate increases above 100 s–1, the
elastic behavior of blood starts to become much more prominent. In
measurements of blood rheology under oscillatory shear, the storage
modulus and loss modulus quantify the elastic and viscous behavior
of fluid at different imposed strain rates. Several experiments performed
on blood show a crossover point, indicating the storage modulus to
dominate over the loss modulus at increasing shear rates.15,20,33 This behavior is counter-intuitive
at first glance as the rouleaux structures start to break down at
high shear rates, which is the prime reason for elasticity of blood
at low shear rates. However, as the clusters break down, they expose
to the plasma proteins in the matrix, which indeed possess elastic
properties. This has been reported by several research groups, although
our experimental findings confirm the dominating elastic behavior
of blood at high shear rates.15,20,33

Plasma matrix contains several proteins that are essential
for
the normal functioning of human life. The most substantial plasma
proteins in blood are albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen ∼55,
38, and 7%, respectively, for a healthy human blood.19 Among these three proteins, the viscoelastic properties
of fibrinogen are well known.18,35 Under significant forces,
as rouleaux structures break down at high shear rates, the fibrinogen
structure gets unfolded and exposed in the plasma matrix; this essentially
triggers elastic extension of plasma under high shear rates.

An estimate for the relaxation can be given as λR = 2πμeffap/ks, referring to the “bead-spring-dumbbell”
model.36 The model considers a dumbbell-like
situation where two spheres of radius, ap, are separated by a distance. The spheres are acted upon by drag
force because of fluid flow having effective viscosity, μeff, which tries to extend the length. However, a spring-like
recoiling force with stiffness ks tries
to resist such elongation. It is important to note that the conceptual
paradigm based on the bead spring model is a bit simplistic for a
complex multiphase fluid blood. However, we refer to the bead spring
model to have an estimate of the relaxation time scales because of
the suspended proteins in the plasma matrix.

For our case, the
radius of the spheres, ap, can be estimated
as 40 nm,35 and
the spring stiffness, ks, is ∼4.5
pN/nm.13 The effective viscosity can be
estimated as the elongational viscosity of blood. It was reported
in rheological measurements that it is about 20–45 Pa s.13 Assuming an intermediate value of 30 Pa s for
elongational viscosity of the flow, the current model predicts a relaxation
time λR ≈ 1.67 ms, which closely corroborates
our experimental findings. The measured relaxation time scales provide
a quantification of the linear viscoelastic properties of plasma proteins
suspended in an elongational flow.

Flow field during pinch-off
is governed by the momentum balance
equation ρ∂u/∂t +
ρu·∇u = −∇p + ∇·σ supplemented with
divergence free condition of u pertaining to incompressibility.
The parameters include ρ, density; t, time; u, velocity vector; p, pressure; and σ, the deviatoric stress tensor. The deviatoric stress
tensor, σ, within the material can be considered
to be composed of σ = σvisc + σel viscous σvisc and elastic σel parts.

Under asymptotic limits close to pinch-off, the axial component
of the velocity vector u is predominant in the neck,
leading to uniaxial diverging flow near the neck region.1 In the context of drop formation, this is known
as the slender jet approximation, which is essentially a one-dimensional
formulation.1 It is worthwhile to note
that the gravity forces are not included in the momentum balance because
of the strong gradients near the singular point of pinch-off, which
result in the capillary, inertial, and viscous forces to be much stronger.
The driving factor for the fluid flow is the capillary pressure gradient,
which is scaled as ∇p ≈ γ(dneckz)−1,
with γ being the coefficient surface tension and z denoting the axial coordinate. The formulation assumes neck curvature
scaling as dneck–1,
leading to a capillary pressure p ≈ γdneck–1.

In the mode
(ii) breakup, we can expect the dominance of elastic
effect over the viscous effect. The time-dependent elastic stress
can be given as8 σel =
σ0 exp(t/3λR) during
late times (t ≫ λR), described
by a balance between the elastic and capillary forces, with σ0 being the stress at t = 0 (constant) and
λR being the relaxation time. In terms of the time
remaining to pinch off, τ = tp – t (with tp being the time of
pinch-off), the relation reads as (σel)zz = β exp(−τ/3λR), with β being a constant. The balance of elastic and capillary
forces leads to an exponential evolution, dneck ≈ exp(τ/3λR). This is typical for
viscoelastic pinch-off and has been observed for several polymer solutions.8,12 Nevertheless, it should be noted that the exponential regime gives
way to other regimes at smaller time scales, which lead to breakup
of the neck.

In mode (i) breakup, however, the deviatoric stress
is dominated
by the viscous stresses. One simple mathematical depiction of the
constitutive behavior of blood is the empirical power law formulation
that generalizes the Newton’s law of viscosity to the form:17σvisc = mEn, where  is a generalized
rate of strain dyadic,
and m and n are the flow consistency
and the flow behavior indices, respectively.

Using the power
law formulation, it follows that ∇·σvisc ≈ muzn/zn+1. In asymptotic time scales of breakup,
the scaling laws can assume several transient regimes depending on
the relative importance of the viscous and inertial forces both within
the fluid and the fluid surrounding the breakup.1,21 In
the case of blood pinch-off, we assume that the viscous forces are
relevant throughout the pinch-off, giving rise to asymptotic regimes,
where viscosity plays a dominant role. Hence, a balance between pressure
gradient and the viscous forces, ∇p ≈
∇·σvisc, is adequate, and
simplifying it in terms of neck diameter, we obtain dneck ≈ (z/uz)n. The temporal
characteristics can be directly obtained from balancing the inertial
terms, ρ∂u/∂t ≈
ρu·∇u, which leads to uz ≈ z/τ. Thus, the neck evolution characteristics in the viscous
regime can be given as dneck ≈
τn, depicting a power law–type
behavior. This has also been observed for several shear-thinning fluids.3,21,24

The evolution of neck diameter, dneck, in the time remaining to pinch-off, τ,
for different blood
samples considered in our study, is shown in Figure 2. The results pertain to both (i) dominant
viscous behavior leading to incessant neck collapsing (Figure 2a) and (ii) dominant elastic
behavior leading to neck extension and breakup (Figure 2b). Considering the scaling arguments, we
expect power law-type behavior and exponential neck thinning in the
later stages of the corresponding modes of breakup, respectively.
The experimental results are thus corroborated with the corresponding
scaling laws. The subsequent power law exponents and relaxation time
scales are obtained from the experimental and theoretical corroborations.

Figure 2 Evolution
of neck diameter dneck in
time remaining to pinch off, τ, at various HCT levels: (a) incessant
neck collapsing and (b) extensional mode of breakup. An incessant
neck-collapsing mode is also presented in (b) for comparison. Accordingly,
the experimental observations of the neck thinning are corroborated
with scaling laws dneck ≈ τ0.74 (solid lines) and dneck ≈
exp(τ/3λR) (dashed lines). Estimated values
of shape relaxation time scales, λR, based on the
best fit of the experimental data, are indicated against each exponential
observation. The experimental data points are represented as the best
fit of the averaged results. Figure S1 in the Supporting Information delineates the experimental uncertainties
for each of the experimental data sets (which were averaged over four
experimental data sets). In the main article, we have not intentionally
added the error bars for better clarity and representation of the
figure.

Values of α corresponding
to different blood sample are indicated
in Figure 2a. Specifically,
α lies around a mean value of 0.74 ± 0.04266. Hence, we
observe an almost universal scaling behavior for a range of hematocrit
from healthy blood donors. In Figure 2a, therefore, we present the theoretical approximation dneck ≈ τn with n = 0.74. We measure the shear viscosity
of different blood samples using a Brookfield viscometer.14 Subsequently, the experimental data were fitted
following a power law consideration with n = 0.74
± 0.04266. Human blood samples collected for our study are pertinent
to healthy individuals; thus, n = 0.70–0.78.
The close convergence of the experimental data with the theoretical
arguments is noteworthy from the figure, thus validating the scaling
arguments.

In Figure 2b, we
show the neck evolutions corresponding to the elastic-type extended
thread breakup mode characterized by the scaling law dneck ≈ exp(τ/3λR). For the
sake of better comprehension, in the figure we also present the sample
data corresponding to pinch-off by incessant neck collapsing. The
extended mode of breakup is shown for healthy blood samples. It is
interesting to note that the exponential thinning with long extended
thread formation is prominent for O(λR) > 10–1 ms. The elastic-type extension becomes prominent
around or before 20 ms and the relaxation time scales are of the order
of 1 ms.

The study of drop formation can be correlated with
various non-dimensional
parameters, which relate the interplay of the capillary, viscous,
and inertial forces. For viscoelastic fluids, the elastic forces become
significant, generating relevant parameters related to relaxation
times of the fluid.31,37−40 The elasto-capillary number is
generally used to compare the relative magnitude of the elastic forces
to the viscous forces (which usually is defined for a fluid with constant
viscosity). However, because of the shear-thinning nature of blood,
its viscosity is dependent on shear rate and hence we adopt the methods
in Clasen et al.30 to construct the elasto-capillary
number. The characteristic capillary thinning velocity for a viscosity-dominated
flow is given by Uη = nΦ1/n(γ/m)1/nR(n–1)/n, where m and n are the flow consistency and flow behavior indices, respectively.30 Here, Φ is a prefactor that depends on
the value of n. The parameters γ and R are the surface tension and the radius of the neck, respectively.
The capillary thinning velocity for an elasticity-dominated flow is
given by Uλ = R/3λR.

Using a value of n =
0.74 and Φ from ref (30), we obtain Uη/Uλ = (4.83)−1λR(γ/mR)1.35. Accordingly,
the elasto-capillary number for blood pinch-off
can be defined as Ec = λR(γ/mR)1.35. Evidently, Ec > 4.83 corresponds to Uλ < Uη, which
represents elastic forces to dominate over viscous forces. For healthy
individuals, m ≈ 10–20 cP/sn–1 and γ ≈ 50–55 mN/m
(from the Supporting Information, Figure
S2). Assuming m = 15 cP/sn–1 and γ = 52.5 mN/m, the critical radius of transition (Ec =
4.83) for λ = 0.78 and 0.27 ms are 5.43 and 2.48 mm, respectively.
Indeed, the elastic behavior starts to become prominent from the neck
radius approximately around the order of 1 mm (see Figure 2b). As the neck radius reduces
further, Ec ≫ 4.83 and the elastic behavior
becomes much more prominent, leading to a balance between elastic
and capillary forces, giving rise to exponential regimes of the evolution
of neck diameter.

It is important to note here that we observed
both the modes of
breakup for all the blood samples irrespective of its hematocrit value.
Hence, the occurrence of a specific mode of breakup cannot be distinguished
on HCT values. Two modes of droplet breakup are seen to occur in a
random manner for any particular blood sample irrespective of HCT.
However, the occurrence of extended mode of breakup (∼80%)
is more than that of the neck-collapsing mode (∼20%). The random
variation in breakup can be attributed to the fact that the blood
samples are also varied with different parameters like concentration
of plasma proteins. However, more investigation is needed to understand
the pinch-off behavior of blood samples that deviate from healthy
concentrations of the different constituents.

Furthermore, to
realize the random occurrence of breakup, we performed
experiments on a particular HCT of 44.8% and compared it with its
plasma, which is depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows the occurrence of both modes of breakup and the plasma solution
following an extended mode of breakup. Figure 3b captures the exponential relaxation regime
as a linear evolution. This phenomenon is common to viscoelastic thread
breakup and is observed after a rapid stretching of the thread, consistent
with our observations.9,10,12 The measured plasma relaxation time of 1.01 ms is close to the reported
value of 0.83 ms by Brust et al.12 However,
all observed relaxation times of blood breakup were within 2 ms.

Figure 3 Evolution
of neck diameter, dneck,
in time remaining to pinch-off, τ, for the same blood sample
and a comparison with its plasma: (a) the plot on the left shows different
modes of breakup with varied relaxation times for the same blood sample
with HCT 44.8%. A comparison with the plasma of the same blood sample
shows that the extended mode of breakup of blood is similar to the
breakup of its plasma solution. (b) The plot on the right shows the
same data from (a) on a semilog plot. The straight lines capture the
exponential thinning regimes for extended-mode breakup. It is observed
at the end of rapid elastic stretching of blood, which is consistent
with the literature. The material relaxation time scale, λR, is calculated from the slope of the straight line.

It is interesting to note the
stochastic phenomenon leading to
a random breakup into one of the modes, which reflects the heterogeneity
of blood in the small volume trapped in the neck (∼5 μL).
An estimate of the strain rates inside the neck can be obtained from
γ̇ ≈ ∂uz/∂z ≈ 1/τ (under slender-jet
approximation). Indeed, at time scales of 10–2 s,
where the separation between the two modes occurs, the strain rates
are of the order of 100 s–1, where most of the rouleaux
structures break down significantly, leading to a discrete flow within
the plasma matrix.34 Also, on careful observation
of the neck during breakup, one can observe the Fahraeus–Lindqvist
effect, where the RBCs reside more near the surface of the neck as
the shear rates are higher toward the central axis. This leaves a
highly dilute suspension of plasma near the center, which drives the
neck to extensional mode of breakup under sufficiently high shear
rates. Hence, we mostly observe an extended mode of breakup. However,
if the local hematocrit concentration in the neck
is high because of heterogeneity, a dominant shear-thinning behavior
is observed as the kinetics of breakdown of the rouleaux is delayed
beyond the small time scales of 10–2 s.

Prior
to concluding, it is important to discuss the associated
uncertainties observed in our experiments. The bias uncertainty arises
predominantly because of the limitations in the camera resolution
and image-processing algorithms. A measure of the bias uncertainty
for neck diameters below 10–4 m is 13.07%, representing
the upper limit, whereas for neck diameters around 10–3 m, it is 0.8%. The total uncertainty is calculated from the processed
experimental data, and a typical set of experiments conducted on HCT
of 44.8% gave a maximum of 14.3% uncertainty for neck diameters around
10–4 m and 1.4% for neck diameters around 10–3 m. For all the conducted experiments, the uncertainty
follows a similar trend with a maximum limit of ∼20%, whereas
the minimum limit is ∼1%. Therefore, it is evident that the
associated uncertainty is substantial as the blood column approached
the lower length scale until breakup. Thus, the measured uncertainties
explain the underlying reason of having scattered data for the neck-collapsing
breakup approach. It is also worth noting here that the overall uncertainty
is dominated by the bias uncertainties because of the limitations
in the experimental setup, whereas the precision uncertainties are
found to be less significant in our investigations.

Conclusions
In summary, blood pinch-off can take place either by incessant
neck collapsing or by extended thread breakup. The former mode is
characterized by a dominant shear-thinning behavior of blood, leading
to a power law-based collapsing of the neck in the time remaining
to pinch-off. The later mode has its genesis in the viscoelastic-type
extensional relaxation of the blood. The extensional mode pertains
to an exponential evolution of neck diameter in the time remaining
to pinch off for the length and time scales mentioned within this
paper. The measured relaxation times are within 0–2 ms and
the extended mode of breakup is very similar to that of plasma. We
strongly believe that fibrinogen plays a significant role in the viscoelastic
nature of plasma solution and the calculated relaxation times of the
fibrinogen structure was of the same order. However, it is also possible
that other plasma proteins and their intermolecular interactions contribute
toward the viscoelastic nature and further research needs to be conducted
to understand this phenomenon. This can have far-reaching consequences
in describing the rheological characteristics of blood under high
shear rates. Despite having the rheological diversities, the macroscopic
manifestation of the underlying phenomenon is essentially governed
by an inhomogeneous distribution of corpuscles in the blood sample
at small length scales, which itself evolves with time. A deeper understanding
of the underlying morphodynamics, as portrayed in this work, may bear
immense contributions to explain the rheological characteristics of
blood, laying groundwork for many other advanced studies on blood
droplets and its rheology.

Materials and Methods
We conducted
experiments on falling pendent blood drop from a tube.
Experiments were performed as per the institutional ethical guidelines
of the authors (approval no. IIT/SRIC/AR/2012). Informed consents
were taken while collecting the blood samples from the volunteers.
The collected blood samples were preserved in anti-coagulant-coated
vials at around 8–20 °C. The samples were directly used
for experiments without any dilution or chemical treatment. The objective
was to maintain the physiologically pertinent condition to the extent
possible. Subsequently, experiments were executed within 24 h after
collection of the sample.

Essentially, blood was flown through
a cylindrical tube to the
ambient. Figure 4 schematically shows the present experimental
consideration. The blood was flown through a syringe pump (Harvard
Apparatus PHD2000) through a tube having diameter of 1.5 mm. One end
of the tube was inserted through the top surface of an enclosed glass
tube. It is known that the physical subtleties over the characteristic
length and time scales, around the neck area during pinch-off, are
independent of the flow features at the far regions.2 Thus, volume flow rate has no influence on the pinch-off
dynamics. However, it is usual to employ a constant flow rate so as
to ensure an intermittent supply of liquid.2,6 Here,
we maintained a volume flow rate of λR = 2πμeffap/ks, through the syringe pump.

Figure 4 Description of the present experimental considerations:
schematic
illustration of the experimental setup.

Blood pinched off at the end of the tube in a surrounding
medium
of air (it can be considered as free-falling blood drop in an enclosed
glass tube) (cf. magnified portion of Figure 4). The images of the free-falling blood drop
were captured through a high-speed camera (AMETEK V641) at a speed
of 10 000 frames per second with a resolution of (640 pixels
× 480 pixels). All the captured images were then post-processed
through an in-house MATLAB code, which takes care of the calculation
of the neck radius using the edge detection method. Repeated experiments
were performed, and the average behaviors along with the corresponding
standard deviations were reported.
