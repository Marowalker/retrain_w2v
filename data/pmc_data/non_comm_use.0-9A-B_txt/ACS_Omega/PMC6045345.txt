The assembly of microreactors has
made considerable progress toward
the fabrication of artificial cells. However, their characterization
remains largely limited to buffer solution-based assays in the absence
of their natural role model—the biological cells. Herein, the
combination of microreactors with HepG2 cells either in planar cell
cultures or in the form of cell aggregates is reported. Alginate (Alg)-based
microreactors loaded with catalase are assembled by droplet microfluidics,
and their activity is confirmed. The acceptance of polymer-coated
∼40 μm Alg particles by proliferating HepG2 cells is
depending on the terminating polymer layer. When these functional
microreactors are cocultured with HepG2 cells, they can be employed
for detoxification, that is, hydrogen peroxide removal, and by doing
so, they assist the cells to survive. This report is among the first
successful combination of microreactors with biological cells, that
is, HepG2 cells, contributing to the fundamental understanding of
integrating synthetic and biological partners toward the maturation
of this semisynthetic concept for biomedical applications.

Introduction
Cell mimicry has recently
attracted considerable interest, aiming
at assembling micro-/nanoreactors which can substitute for missing
or lost cellular function.1 Nanoreactors
are typically considered as artificial organelles aiming to be intracellularly
active. Diverse assemblies have been reported with confirmed activity
in buffer solution as recently reviewed,2,3 with only few
reports showing intracellular activity.4−11 On the other hand, microreactors represent artificial cells. Microreactors
have been assembled as single- or multicomponent systems as extensively
reviewed.12−14 In this context, liposomes within liposomes, polymersomes
within polymersomes, and capsosomes (liposomes within polymer capsules)
are the most successful concepts to date in terms of both structural
and functional complexities.15 For example,
a gated multistep enzymatic reaction in a three-liposome system has
been demonstrated.16 The incorporation
of pH-sensitive transmembrane channels,17 control over encapsulation18 and release,19 and the performance of encapsulated cascade
reactions20,21 are highlights of polymersomes in polymersome
assemblies. Recently, capsosomes have been used not only for triggered
cargo release22 and encapsulated cascade
reactions23 but also for locally confined
encapsulated catalysis.24 Moreover, we
employed capsosomes loaded with the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase
as extracellular microreactors in the presence of cells as potential
oral treatment for phenylketonuria.25 Recently,
we employed sub-10 μm-sized catalase-loaded core–shell
particles and capsosomes as microreactors to support HepG2 cells in
planar cell culture.26 However, despite
the demonstrated diverse functionality of capsosomes, they suffer
from two main inherent shortcomings. First, the layer-by-layer-based
assembly is labor-intensive, and second, the loading capacity with
liposomes is inherently limited, even when multiple liposome deposition
steps were considered, because they are deposited onto the surface
of solid template particles.27

Herein,
we report the use of enzyme-loaded alginate (Alg) particles
as extracellular microreactors and assess their performance in the
presence of HepG2 cells. Specifically, we (i) characterized ∼40
μm Alg particles in their ability to integrate into a proliferating
HepG2 cell culture depending on their surface coating, (ii) assembled
Alg-based microreactors loaded with catalase via droplet microfluidics
(D-μF) and confirmed their biocatalytic activity, and (iii)
demonstrated that these microreactors cocultured with HepG2 cells
improved the viability of the HepG2 cells in planar cultures and in
cell aggregates by degrading externally added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Scheme 1).

microreactors and HepG2 cells are exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the ability of the artificial partner
to support the viability of the HepG2 cells is assessed.

Results and Discussion
Alg Particle Assembly and Coating
Alg particles were
produced by D-μF. Particles with a diameter of approximately
40 μm were chosen because it is ∼4× larger than
an individual hepatocyte and will ensure that multiple cells could
interact with one microreactor. Alg is a biopolymer which is widely
used as a biomaterial as extensively reviewed by Lee and Mooney29 or Sun and Tan.30 D-μF was employed to assemble the Alg particles because this
method allows for the fast fabrication of particles with narrow dispersity
of different sizes, shapes, and softnesses including control over
the type and amount of loaded cargo, as recently discussed by Beebe
and co-workers31 and Armada-Moreira et
al.32 There are multiple examples of Alg
particles produced by D-μF.33−35 The cross-linking of
the Alg droplets into stable particles is among the major challenges
in this context. The penetration of Ca2+ ions from outside
as illustrated by a recent work from Wang et al.34 and by internal cross-linking due to the Ca2+ ion release from the Alg droplet as reported by Liu et al.36 or Mazutis et al.37 are examples in this context. Other recent interesting reports include
nonspherical Alg microgels.38−40

Inspired by these prior
efforts, we fabricated Alg particles by D-μF. Further, with
the aim to better control the particle/HepG2 cell interaction in cell
culture, the Alg particles were coated with PLL (Alg+)
and PLL/PMAc (Algc). Uncoated Alg particles were inherently
negatively charged. PLL equipped the particles with a positive charge,
while cholesterol was expected to facilitate cell adhesion to the
particles due to the nonspecific incorporation of cholesterol into
the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, as we have previously observed
on planar surfaces.28 First, the effect
of the terminating layers on the morphology of the soft Alg particles
was assessed by visualizing the particles using optical microscopy
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1). The bright-field images confirmed the
presence of intact nonaggregated Alg particles of similar sizes in
HEPES1 buffer solution (10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), pH 7.4). PLL was not only immobilized on the surface
of the particles but also diffused into the Alg particles (Figure 1ii, inset). Interestingly,
when the PLL concentration was doubled in the coating step for the
samples Alg+ (2×) and Algc (2×) (Figure 1iii,v), surface wrinkling
and particle shrinkage of the structurally intact particles were observed.
Although not further explored in this report, this is a relevant finding
because wrinkled surfaces have proven to beneficially affect the biological
response as, for instance, recently illustrated by Li et al.41 Further, the SEM images revealed that the uncoated
Alg particles disintegrated upon drying, whereas particles coated
with either PLL or PLL/PMAc improved their stability and could preserve
their structural integrity also in the dried state.

Coculturing of (Coated)
Alg Particles with HepG2 Cells
Planar Cell Culture
The first step toward the combination
of synthetic and biological entities requires the acceptance of the
presence of the former by the proliferating HepG2 cell population.
Although particles which support cell adhesion have before been coencapsulated
with L929 cells in liquefied Alg capsules and a beneficial cellular
response has been observed,42 to the best
of our knowledge, the coculturing of Alg-based microreactors and biological
cells has never been reported before. Herein, we assessed the growth
of HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of ∼40 μm Alg
particles with different surface chemistries.

First, the ability
of HepG2 cells to integrate uncoated Alg particles into the proliferating
cell population was assessed by mixing and coculturing HepG2 cells
in cell-to-Alg particle ratios of 25/1 and 1/1. The cells proliferated
with longer incubation times for both ratios; that is, increasing
the number of Alg particles did not seem to have any effect on the
cell growth (Supporting Information, Figure
S1). After washing and fixing, only the integrated Alg particles remained
(Supporting Information, Figure S2). Only
very few Alg particles were preserved for the 25/1 ratio, whereas
the ratio 1/1 showed a large number of residual Alg particles. To
get further insights how the Alg particles interacted with the cells,
a cell-to-Alg particle ratio of 25/1 was cocultured for 72 h and then
visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), by imaging
different focal planes (Supporting Information, Figure S3). The very few particles were embedded in the cell population,
with the cells growing along the particle surface, indicating the
interaction between the HepG2 cells and the Alg particles.

In
the next step, the coated particles Alg+ and Algc were cocultured with the HepG2 cells for 24, 48, and 72 h
in a cell-to-particle ratio of 25/1 (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The bright-field images of fixed cells
showed that, in general, much more coated particles were integrated
in the proliferating HepG2 cells compared to their uncoated counterparts.
Counting the particles per area revealed that ∼3× more
Alg+ and Algc were present than (uncoated) Alg
when the same cell-to-particle ratio was used for seeding (Supporting Information, Figure S5). This result
was likely because of the fact that the coated particles allowed for
cell attachment via electrostatic interactions and/or cholesterol
anchoring. However, there was no obvious difference between Algc and Alg+. With the aim to get further insights
into the cell–particle interactions, the different cocultures
were fixed and stained after 72 h incubation time for visualization
by CLSM. The images were taken on the top, in the middle, and on the
bottom of the cocultures to determine how the particles were combining
with the HepG2 cells. No surface-coating-dependent differences in
the integration of the particles were observed (Figure 2a). The HepG2 cells interacted with the Alg+ and Algc particles on the bottom and middle level,
whereas again barely any cells were observed on top of the particles.

Figure 2 Surface
coatings: (a) representative CLSM images, taken at different
focal planes, of the coated Alg+ (i) and Algc (ii) particles cocultured with the HepG2 cells for 72 h (cell-to-particle
ratio 25/1). The scale bars are 50 μm [blue: 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI)-stained nuclei; green: fluorescently labeled Alg; and red:
phalloidin-stained cytoskeleton]. (b) Cell viability: the viability
of the HepG2 cells in the cocultures in comparison to that of a HepG2
monoculture is shown by assessing the activity of cellular dehydrogenase
(culture time: 72 h, cell-to-Alg-based particle ratio: 25/1, and n = 3).

In an attempt to quantitatively
compare the number of viable cells
in the cell/particle cocultures to a HepG2 monoculture, the cellular
metabolic activity, that is, the cellular dehydrogenase activity was
assessed after 72 h (Figure 2b). Neither a significant increase nor decrease in dehydrogenase
activity was observed for any of the cocultures in comparison to HepG2
cells only, indicating that the presence of the particles had no negative
effect on the cells in this aspect.

Following on, we aimed to
determine the performance of the cocultures
over extended period of times, that is, up to 10 d. To this end, Algc particles were cocultured with the HepG2 cells, followed
by fixing and staining after the desired incubation times for inspection
by CLSM (Figure 3a).
Overall, the cells proliferated in the cocultures and integrated the
particles, with more HepG2 cells observed in the top area of the particles
compared to the shorter incubation times.

Figure 3 (a) Representative CLSM
images, taken at different focal planes,
of Algc cocultured with the HepG2 cells for 7 d (i) and
10 d (ii) (cell-to-Algc ratio 25/1). The scale bars are
50 μm (blue: DAPI-stained nuclei; green: fluorescently labeled
Alg; and red: phalloidin-stained cytoskeleton). (b) Viability of the
HepG2 cells in the cocultures in comparison to that of a HepG2 monoculture
is shown by assessing the activity of cellular dehydrogenase (culture
time: 7 and 10 d, cell-to-Algc ratio: 25/1, and n = 3). (c) dsDNA quantification of HepG2 cell/Algc cocultures (cell-to-Algc ratios: 25/1 and 10/1) in comparison
to cells only after 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, 10 d, and 13 d (n = 3).

To compare the metabolic activity
of the cells in coculture to
that in the monoculture at this extended culturing times, the dehydrogenase
activity was assessed after 7 and 10 d (Figure 3b). No significant differences were observed.
To obtain additional information on the cell proliferation,43 the DNA in the cocultures was quantified and
compared to that in the monocultures for up to 13 d (Figure 3c). Two different cell-to-Algc ratios were employed to understand the sensitivity of the
proliferation of the HepG2 cells toward a higher amount of artificial
entities. The results confirmed the increasing number of HepG2 cells
with longer incubation times. There was no significant difference
in the amount of measured double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) between the
co- and monocultures or depending on the number of Algc particles.

HepG2 Cell Aggregates
Because living
tissue does not
(predominantly) exist in 2D, we aimed to understand if artificial
entities can also be integrated with their biological partner in cell
aggregates, mimicking simple 3D tissue. The assembly of cell aggregates
requires proper interaction between the HepG2 cells and the particles
because gravity-driven codeposition cannot be considered a core-driving
force as in the planar cell cultures. To this end, cells and Algc (cell-to-particle ratio 25/1 or 10/1) were seeded in well
plates with ultralow adhesion surfaces, typically used for cell aggregate
growth, and incubated for 24 h, 3 d, and 7 d. The bright-field images
of these live cell aggregates revealed that the HepG2 cells did not
yield in typical cell aggregates but more in toruslike structures,
that is, a dense ring of cells with a loosely filled void (Figure 4ai). Importantly,
the Algc particles were integrated in this type of cell
aggregates (Figure 4aii). However, after 24 h of incubation, the cell aggregates only
started to form, exhibiting a loose structure, especially when the
cell-to-Algc ratio was 10/1 (Figure 4aiii, top). Increasing the coculture time
to 3 and 7 d led to denser cell aggregates. Further, longer incubation
decreased the cell aggregate size for cells only and cell/Algc mixtures (Figure 4b). Not surprisingly, the size of the cell aggregate was smallest
for HepG2-cell-only samples and increased with increasing number of
Algc particles present. This is an important aspect, illustrating
that the artificial partners might contribute to the required mass
of tissue needed for the envisioned applications, for example, transplantation.
What is more, the Algc size also affected the cell aggregate
size. Cell aggregates assembled using Algc with a size
of ∼65 μm instead of ∼40 μm increased by
∼20% after 24 h incubation time (Supporting Information, Figure S6).

Figure 4 Cell aggregates—size: (a) bright-field
images of cell aggregates
assembled from HepG2 cells only (i) and HepG2 cells and Algc in a cell-to-particle ratio of 25/1 (ii) and 10/1 (iii). Images
were taken after 24 h, 3 d, and 7 d. The scale bars are 500 μm.
(b) Diameter of the different cell aggregates depending on the entities
used for the fabrication and the incubation time (n = 3).

Finally, cell aggregates assembled
after 24 h, 3 d, and 7 d were
fixed, stained, and visualized by CLSM, illustrating the integration
and preserved integrity of Algc with the HepG2 cells (Figures 5 and S7).

Figure 5 Representative CLSM images of cell aggregates
assembled from HepG2
cells only (i) and HepG2 cells and Algc in a cell-to-particle
ratio of 25/1 (ii) and 10/1 (iii). Images were taken after 24 h, 3
d, and 7 d. The scale bars are 50 μm (blue: DAPI-stained nuclei
and green: PLLF of the coated Algc).

With the aim to investigate the viability of the
HepG2 cells in
the cell aggregates, a fluorescence-based live/dead staining assay
was employed where viable cells and dead cells were stained by fluorescein
diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI), respectively. There were similar low numbers of dead cells for cell aggregates
without or with Algc after 24 h incubation time (Figure 6i–iii, top). However, when the cultivation times increased
to 3 and 7 d, more dead cells were observed in the core of the cell
aggregates in the absence of Algc. Because of the densification
of the cell aggregates over time, the transportation of nutrition
and oxygen to the tissue center likely became increasingly difficult,
which is a general observation in cell aggregates. The presence of
Algc might counteract these transport issues by slowing
down the tissue densification and/or by providing “weak spots”
which facilitated the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. Therefore,
the survival of the HepG2 cells in the denser areas improved, illustrated
by the lower amount of dead cells observed after 7 d (Figure 6i vs 6ii/iii, bottom, and Supporting Information, Figure S8). The visual observations were confirmed by quantifying
the live and dead cell areas (Figure 6b). Cell-only aggregates contained significantly more
dead cells after 7 d compared to 3 d incubation time. Further, cell-only
aggregates also had significantly more dead cells present compared
to the cell aggregates containing Algc after 7 d. Taken
together, Algc not only allowed the cell aggregates to
form but also improved the tissue health in the tested time for the
assessed parameter.

bars are 50 μm. (b) Dead-cell fraction of the cell aggregates

Assembly of Alg-Based Microreactors
With the aim to
equip the artificial partner with functionality, the Alg-based particles
were turned into microreactors by entrapping the enzyme catalase using
D-μF. Microreactors based on Alg particles have previously been
prepared by entrapping glucose oxidase,44 lipase,45 and urease46 using syringe injection for their preparation. Although
the enzymatic activity was typically preserved, the retention of the
enzymes tends to be low and/or uncontrollable because of their leakage
into the surrounding solution during formation, storage, and use.
In an attempt to overcome this issue, polymer multilayers were deposited
on the Alg particles and improved retention was observed.47 Encapsulation of enzymes in particles or coatings
always bears the risk of loss of function because the enzymatic activity
strongly relies on the 3D structure of the protein. To this end, liposomes
were trapped within the Alg particles with the aim to serve as cargo
deposits. Empty liposomes [e.g., polydiacetylene liposomes48 or cholesterol/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) liposomes49], liposomes preloaded with a fluorescent dye combined with iron
oxide nanoparticles, used for the heat-controlled dye release from
liposomes,50 and liposomes preloaded with
the hydrophobic coenzyme Q1051 were reported
to be encapsulated in the Alg particles. Complementary to these prior
efforts, we assembled liposome-loaded Alg particles by D-μF
using ∼150 nm fluorescently labeled 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC)/DPPC liposomes (LF). These types of lipids were chosen because we previously
showed that their temperature-responsive properties could be used
to trigger the microreactors.25 Further,
at room temperature (RT), the lipid bilayer is in the gel phase, assisting
in the prevention of enzyme leakage. To reduce the liposome aggregation
during the D-μF process, LF was exposed to a PLL
solution, followed by carefully mixing with the Alg solution in different
liposome-to-Alg solution volume ratios. The latter aspect aimed at
controlling the amount of entrapped liposomal subunits per microreactor.
The microreactors (AlgLF) fabricated by D-μF were
stable and nonaggregated when suspended in buffer solution (Figure 7ai–ci). Further,
increasing the amount of added LF to the Alg solution prior
to the assembly led to a higher observed green fluorescence, suggesting
a higher loading of LF in the AlgLF microreactors
(Figure 7aii–cii).
The distribution of LF within the entire Alg particles
was confirmed by CLSM (Figure 7ciii). From now on, the microreactors will be assembled using
25 v % liposome stock solution and PLL/PMAc as terminating layers
will be deposited onto the Alg particles to ensure their incorporation
with the proliferating HepG2 cells.

Catalase (cat) is an enzyme responsible
for the degradation of
H2O2. It is a protective enzyme present in nearly
all animal cells. Therefore, cat was loaded into the liposomal subunits
(Lcat) to obtain functional microreactors AlgLcat. By using DyLight 633-labeled catalase (catr) and NBD-labeled
lipids, the microreactors (AlgLFcatr) were visualized
using CLSM (Figure 8ai). Further, microreactors were assembled by mixing free cat into the
Alg solution prior to the assembly by D-μF (Algcat). The successful
cat loading into the microreactors was confirmed by CLSM using catr (Algcatr, Figure 8aii). Although AlgLFcatr exhibited
homogenously distributed catr and LF across
the entire particles, Algcat had the catr concentrated
on the surface with large catr aggregates, illustrating
that the liposomes were beneficial for the assembly of the microreactors.
To confirm the enzymatic activities of AlgLcat and Algcat,
an increasing number of these microreactors were exposed to a 40 μM
H2O2 solution for 30 min. The remaining H2O2 was measured by testing the fluorescence intensity
of the highly fluorescent oxidation product resorufin, using the commercial
Amplex Red assay, and normalized to the initial H2O2 concentration in solution (Figure 8b). Both types of microreactors reduced the
amount of detected H2O2 in a similar manner,
confirming the presence of cat with preserved activity. As expected,
increasing numbers of microreactors led to an increasing amount of
removed H2O2. It was estimated that ∼2.6
nM H2O2 per minute could be converted by a single
microreactor.

labeled microreactors AlgLFcatr (i) and Algcatr (ii) (red (catr): DyLight 633-labeled catalase
and green (LF): NBD-PC-labeled lipids). The scale bars
are 50 μm. (b) Activity of microreactors assessed via their
ability to remove H2O2. The normalized fluorescence
intensity of a H2O2-containing solution assessed
by the Amplex Red assay after being exposed to AlgLcat and
Algcat for 30 min is plotted (n = 3).

Following on, the stability of the microreactors
was tested by
incubating 25 000 AlgLcat or Algcat microreactors
per mL HEPES1 buffer at 37 °C for 24 h prior to the assessment
of the enzymatic activity (Supporting Information, Figure S9a). Whereas this 24 h buffer incubation step did not significantly
affect the ability of AlgLcat to convert H2O2, the activity of Algcat was ∼12× reduced. This
observation further illustrated that the liposomal subcompartments
were beneficial for the microreactors. Additionally, with the goal
to understand if the temperature-responsive liposome had an effect
on the activity of the microreactors as we had previously observed
for capsosomes,22,25,52 AlgLcat and Algcat were exposed to a 40 μM H2O2 solution either at RT or at 37 °C for 30
min, followed by using the Amplex Red assay at RT (Supporting Information, Figure S9b). The results confirmed
that AlgLcat exhibited a higher activity at 37 °C
compared to RT because of the better access of the enzymes to H2O2 when the lipid bilayer was in its liquid phase,
whereas no difference was observed for Algcat. This latter finding
also points toward a temperature-independent enzymatic activity in
the microreactors.

Active Microreactors in HepG2 Cell Cultures
With the
aim to confirm that the artificial entities can not only serve as
a structural support for the cells but also impose a beneficial effect
on the HepG2 cells, we assessed their ability to support the biological
cells in detoxification, one of the major functions of the liver.
Specifically, the goal was to alleviate the pressure from the growing
HepG2 cells when stressed with H2O2 using Algcat
or AlgLcat. We anticipated that the encapsulated enzyme
cat could remove/reduce the toxic H2O2 and,
by doing so, AlgLcat and Algcat would impose a beneficial
effect on the entire cell culture. First, the cocultures of the microreactors
AlgLFcatr or Algcatr and the HepG2
cells were visualized using CLSM after 6 h incubation time (Figure 9a). The microreactors
were surrounded by the HepG2 cells; although the fluorescent lipids
could not be detected, catr aggregates were present in
both microreactors.

Figure 9 Microreactors in planar cell cultures: (a) representative
CLSM
images of bionic tissue of HepG2 cells and Algcatr (i)
and AlgLFcatr (ii) after 6 h incubation time.
The scale bars are 50 μm. Dose–response curves of bionic
tissue consisting of HepG2 cells and Algcat, AlgLcat, or
AlgL when exposed to different concentrations of H2O2 for 24 h (b) and 48 h (c) (n = 3, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05).

Following on, the detoxification ability of the microreactors
was
assessed in cell culture. To this end, we cocultured the HepG2 cells
with AlgLcat, Algcat, and AlgL (10/1 cell-to-microreactor
ratio) for 10 h, followed by stressing the assembled tissue with different
concentrations of H2O2 for 24 h (Figure 9b). The first two microreactors
were aimed at removing H2O2, whereas AlgL was
used as a control to monitor the reduction in cell viability due to
the presence of H2O2. The viability of the HepG2
cells in the presence of the microreactors depending on the H2O2 concentration was measured and compared to that
of the HepG2 monocultures by assessing the cellular dehydrogenase
activity. The obtained dose–response curves confirmed that
cell cultures containing AlgLcat and Algcat exhibited a
higher cell viability compared to cocultures with AlgL and cells only
(Supporting Information, Figure S10). Further,
as expected, the dose–response curves for cells only and cocultures
with empty microreactors were similar. The viability of the HepG2
cells in the presence of the cat-loaded microreactors was significantly
higher when exposed to H2O2 in a concentration
between 0.5 and 1 mM, demonstrating the positive effect of the artificial
entities on the entire tissue. Further, Algcat was significantly more
efficient compared to AlgLcat. More specifically, the median
lethal dose (LD50) for H2O2 could
be shifted from ∼0.5 to >1 mM for cocultures with Algcat.
On
the other hand, LD50 of cocultures with AlgLcat changed to ∼0.8 mM H2O2.

With
the goal to estimate the time these microreactors remained
active in cell culture, the viability was also assessed after 48 h
exposure to H2O2 (Figure 9c). Specifically, after the first 24 h incubation
with H2O2 as described above, the same volume
of fresh cell medium containing H2O2 was added,
followed by another 24 h incubation before assessing the cell viability.
Both cat-loaded microreactors still supported the HepG2 cells against
H2O2 in a concentration range of 0.2–0.5
mM, although not as impressively as in the first 24 h. A significant
difference was observed only for 0.4 mM H2O2, and the shift in LD50 was only minor yet still detectable.

Finally, cell aggregates assembled from the HepG2 cells and Algc or Algcat microreactors in cell-to-microreactor ratios of
25/1 and 10/1 were let to incubate for 24 h. These cell aggregates
were exposed to cell media supplemented with different H2O2 concentrations (0–1 mM) for another 24 h prior
to the assessment of the cell viability (Figure 10). The dose–response curves indicated
that the Algcat microreactors significantly improved the viability
of the HepG2 cells compared to the aggregates equipped with Algc when exposed to 0.25–0.5 mM H2O2 using a cell-to-microreactor ratio of 25/1. On the other hand, when
a higher number of microreactors were present (cell-to-microreactor
ratio 10/1), the survival of the HepG2 cells was significantly improved
for up to 0.75 mM H2O2, illustrating that these
microreactors could act as beneficial functional partners in HepG2
cell aggregates.

Figure 10 Microreactors in cell aggregates: dose–response
curves of
cell aggregates consisting of HepG2 cells and either Algcat or Algc in cell-to-microreactor ratios of 25/1 or 10/1 when exposed
to different concentrations of H2O2 for 24 h
(n = 3, **p < 0.01, and *p < 0.05).

Conclusions
We report the assembly of HepG2 cells and
∼40 μm Alg
particles as artificial counterparts in planar cell cultures and in
cell aggregates. It was found that coating the particles was beneficial
for their successful combination with proliferating HepG2 cells. Further,
the particles did not negatively affect the proliferation of the HepG2
cells. PMAc-coated Alg-based particles were converted into functional
microreactors by encapsulating catalase either as the free enzyme
or entrapped into liposomes. Finally, when coculturing the microreactors
with the HepG2 cells, the artificial entities were able to preserve
the viability of the HepG2 cells when exposed to H2O2. Although no long-term activity of the microreactors in cell
culture was observed, these are the first-generation microreactors
of their kind; with due improvements, for example, higher enzyme loading,
more protective layers, the use of nanoparticles or organic molecules
as enzyme mimics, alternative enzymes including cytochromes, etc.,
long-term activity will be feasible; and the benefit of the artificial
entities will further mature. Although cell mimicry concepts remain
in their infancies with a large number of challenges to be overcome
and fundamental insights to be obtained, artificial cells might offer
an alternative in future biomedical technologies such as the development
of active 3D printed tissue engineering scaffolds or next-generation
extracorporeal temporary (liver) support devices.

units mg–1 solid), cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8),
and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 w/w %) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 5-(4,6-Dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein
(5-DTAF), the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab′)2 fragment
of goat antimouse IgG, DyLight 633 maleimide, Quant-iT PicoGreen cell
proliferation assay, and the Amplex Red catalase assay kit were purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific. DMPC, DPPC, and fluorescent lipid 1-oleoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)
amino] hexanoyl]-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (NBD-PC)
were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, USA.

Three types of
buffers were used: TRIS buffer consisting of 10 mM TRIS at pH 8.5,
HEPES1 buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, and HEPES2 buffer
consisting of 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4. The buffer solutions
were made with ultrapure water (monodistillation unit, GFL Corporation,
Germany).

Poly(methacrylic acid-co-cholesteryl
methacrylate)
(PMAc)28 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled
PLL (PLLF)24 were synthesized
following the procedures published previously. Labeled Alg was prepared
by dropwise addition of a 10 mg mL–1 5-DTAF solution
to a 10 mg mL–1 Alg solution in 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9), followed by incubation for 1 h and purification
by dialysis overnight. Labeled catalase (catr) was prepared
by adding 5 μL of DyLight 633 maleimide (5 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide)
to a 5 mg mL–1 catalase solution in HEPES1 buffer,
followed by incubation for 6 h. The labeled enzyme was purified by
dialysis overnight and lyophilized.

Unilamellar liposome (L)
stock solutions were prepared by drying
5 mg of lipids in chloroform (4.2 mg of DMPC and 0.8 mg of DPPC) under
vacuum for 1 h, followed by rehydration into 1 mL of HEPES1 buffer. For catalase-loaded liposomes (Lcat and Lcatr), 2 mg mL–1 catalase and catr in HEPES1 buffer were used for rehydration, respectively.
The solution was extruded first through 400 nm filters and then through
100 nm filters (11×) at 40 °C. Lcat and Lcatr were dialyzed for 36 h with four times changing
the HEPES1 buffer solution. For fluorescent liposomes LF, 1 wt % NBD-PC was added to the lipid solution.

Alg Particle
Assembly and Coating
Alg particles were
prepared by D-μF. A microfluidic device with wide channel cross-section
dimensions of 100 μm × 300 μm (depth × width)
was used (Dolomite). The channels were rendered hydrophobic by coating
with PFOTES (30 min). Three solutions (organic fluid, inorganic fluid,
and receptor solution) were prepared to generate calcium cross-linked
Alg particles. A mixture of 5 wt % of Span 80/TWEEN 80 (9/1 in weight
ratio) in decane was used as the organic fluid. The inorganic fluid
was prepared by dissolving 1.5 wt % Alg (containing 5 wt % labeled
Alg for visualization) in HEPES1 buffer solution. Syringe pumps (Harvard
Apparatus) were used to control the flow rates of these two solutions.
The flow rates for organic fluid and inorganic fluid were 1.5 and
0.08 mL h–1, respectively. The receptor solution
consisted of a 120 mM CaCl2 solution. The droplet production
was visualized in a 1 × 81 motorized inverted Olympus microscope.
Alg particles were separated from the receptor solution by three washing
cycles in ultrapure water (4500 g, 2 min). To coat these Alg particles,
they were suspended in a PLL solution (1 and 2 mg mL–1 in HEPES1 buffer, 15 min), followed by washing three times in HEPES1
buffer, yielding Alg+ and Alg+ (2×). If
needed, the particles were suspended in a PMAc solution (1 mg mL–1 in HEPES1 buffer, 15 min) and washed three times
in HEPES1 buffer, yielding Algc. The particle number of
the stock solutions was counted using the microscope by averaging
the particle number in 3 × 1 μL of solution. The Alg and
Algc particles were imaged using the inverted Olympus microscope,
and SEM images were taken using a field emission scanning electron
microscope from FEI (Nova-600).

Microreactor Assembly
Microreactors were prepared by
D-μF by adding either Lcat or cat to the Alg solution.
With the aim to prevent the liposomes from aggregating during mixing
with the Alg solution, they were coated with PLL by adding 100 μL
of 0.1 mg mL–1 PLL solution dropwise to 100 μL
of liposome stock solution, followed by 15 min incubation. Then, 200
μL of 3 wt % Alg solution (in HEPES1 buffer) was added dropwise
to this mixture and used for the microreactor preparation by D-μF.
Microreactors with different amounts of entrapped liposomes were prepared
by controlling the liposome volume. Using L, LF, Lcat, and Lcatr yielded AlgL, AlgLF, AlgLcat, and AlgLcatr microreactors,
respectively. Furthermore, 3 wt % Alg solution (in HEPES1 buffer)
was mixed with 0.7 mg mL–1 or 2 mg mL–1 cat or catr in HEPES1 buffer solution in a volume ratio
1:1, and the mixture was used for the Algcat or Algcatr microreactor preparation, respectively. All microreactors were further
coated with PLL and PMAc as mentioned above. The microreactors were
visualized by using the inverted Olympus microscope or a confocal
laser scanning microscope (Zeiss Axiovert microscope coupled to a
LSM 700 confocal scanning module).

Microreactor Activity
AlgLcat and Algcat
microreactor activities were measured using the Amplex Red assay kit.
25 000, 10 000, 6000, and 1200 microreactors in 25 μL
of HEPES1 buffer reacted with 25 μL of 40 μM H2O2 for 30 min at RT, and then, 50 μL of 100 μM
Amplex Red reagent solution and 0.4 U mL–1 HRP were
added for 30 min at 37 °C. The fluorescence of the solution was
measured in a multiplate reader. Also, 25 000 AlgLcat and Algcat microreactors were incubated in 2 mL of HEPES1 buffer
at 37 °C for 24 h, and the microreactor activities before and
after incubation were measured as described above. Furthermore, 10 000
AlgLcat and Algcat microreactors were exposed to 40 μM
H2O2 for 30 min at RT or 37 °C, and the
Amplex Red assay was used at RT. The statistical significance used
to compare the distribution was determined using a one-way ANOVA with
a confidence level of 95% (α = 0.05), followed by a Tukey’s
post hoc test if the one-way ANOVA result was significant.

Cell Culture
The HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma
cell line (European Collection of Cell Cultures) was used for all
experiments. The HepG2 cells (1 500 000 cells per flask
in 20 mL of cell medium) were cultured in 75 cm2 culture
flasks in minimum Eagle’s essential medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U mL–1 penicillin, 50
μg mL–1 streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino
acids, and 2 mM l-glutamine (all from Sigma) at 37 °C
and 5% CO2.

Coculturing (Planar)
Glass slides
(9 mm diameter) were
cleaned via sonication in ethanol for 10 min, rinsed with ultrapure
water, dried under nitrogen flow, and exposed to UV/ozone for 15 min.
The Alg, Alg+, and Algc particles were cocultured
with HepG2 cells in different cell/particle ratios. First, the particles
were mixed with the cells, and then, the mixtures were seeded at a
density of 180 000 cells per well in 1.5 mL of cell medium
in 24-well plates and allowed to attach and proliferate for 24 h,
48 h, 72 h, 7 d, and 10 d at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The
cell medium was exchanged every 2 d. Further, for the visualization
of the integration of the microreactors into the HepG2 cell culture
by CLSM, the Algcatr and AlgLcatr microreactors were cocultured with the HepG2 cells in a cell/microreactor
number ratio of 10/1 using 180 000 cells per well in 1.5 mL
of cell medium in 24-well plates for 6 h. The cultures were fixed
in a cooled solution of glacial acetic acid (5% in EtOH, 10 min) and
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For cell
staining, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then soaked
in T-PBS (0.1 vol % Triton X-100 in PBS, 15 min), followed by blocking
using 2% bovine serum albumin in T-PBS for 2 h at RT. Staining of
focal adhesions was carried out by incubation with the primary antibody
monoclonal antivinculin (10 mg mL–1, 1.5 h) and
subsequent incubation with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488
F(ab′)2 fragment of goat antimouse IgG (5 mg mL–1, 1 h). The nuclei and actin filaments were stained with DAPI (1
μg mL–1) and phalloidin (0.1 μg mL–1), respectively, during the second incubation step.
The samples were washed carefully three times in T-PBS in between
all abovementioned steps and stored in PBS at 4 °C in the dark
until mounted on a glass cover slide using mounting medium (Eukitt,
Sigma) for visualization. The live cells and fixed cells were imaged
using the inverted Olympus microscope or CLSM. All cell experiments
were performed in at least three independent repeats. The number of
particles present after fixing was counted on two to three images
of three independent repeats.

Cell Proliferation (Planar)
Alg, Alg+, and
Algc were mixed with the HepG2 cells in a cell-to-particle
ratio of 25/1, seeded at a density of 80 000 cells per well
in 0.6 mL of cell medium in 48-well plates, and let to proliferate
for 3 d at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Further, the Algc-containing cocultures were also allowed to proliferate for
7 and 10 d. The cell media was exchanged every 2 d. The metabolic
activity of the cells in the cocultures was assessed by measuring
the cellular dehydrogenase after 3, 7, and 10 d using the CCK-8 (Dojindo).
The cell media was replaced with 200 μL of media containing
10 vol % assay solution in each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C
and 5% CO2 prior to the absorption measurements using the
multiplate reader. The results were normalized to untreated HepG2
monocultures. All cell experiments were performed in at least three
independent repeats.

The PicoGreen cell proliferation assay
was used to quantify the cell proliferation by measuring the amount
of dsDNA following the protocol of the supplier. Briefly, Algc particles were cocultured with the HepG2 cells (a cell-to-particle
ratio of 25/1 or 10/1 in 200 μL of cell medium) with 10 000
cells mL–1 in each well of a 48-well plate, and
the cell medium was changed every 2 d. The cells were harvested and
immediately frozen down after 72 h, 7 d, 10 d, and 13 d. Then, all
cell samples were thawed, 1 mL of digestion solution in Dulbecco’s
PBS buffer [125 μg mL–1 papain, 0.242 mg mL–1l-cysteine, and 0.333 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)] was added, and the mixtures were incubated overnight
at 65 °C. Following on, the mixtures were diluted 32× using
TE buffer (TE buffer, 1×, pH 7.5, is composed of 10 mM Tris-HCl
and 1 mM EDTA.). Diluted samples (100 μL) were transferred to
a 96-well plate, and 100 μL of 200× diluted PicoGreen reagent
was added to each well, followed by incubation at RT for 2–5
min. A multiplate reader was used to measure the fluorescence of each
well by setting the excitation wavelength to 480 nm and the emission
wavelength to 520 nm. The amount of dsDNA of each sample was calculated
according to the standard curve (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Detoxification (Planar)
Fifty thousand
cells and 5000
microreactors (Algcat, AlgLcat, or AlgL) in 100 μL
of cell medium were seeded in each well of a 48-well plate. After
10 h, 100 μL of fresh cell medium containing different amounts
of H2O2 (0–2 mM) was added to each well.
After 24 h, the cell viability was assessed, or 200 μL of fresh
cell medium containing different amounts of H2O2 was added to each well to double the cell medium volume while keeping
the H2O2 concentration (0–0.5 mM) constant,
followed by cell viability measurements. The cell viability was assessed
using the CCK-8 by replacing the cell medium with 200 μL of
cell medium containing 10 vol % assay solution in each well and incubating
for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 prior to the absorption
measurements using the multiplate reader. Three independent repeats
in triplicates were performed. The statistical significance used to
compare the distribution was determined using a one-way ANOVA with
a confidence level of 95%, followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test
if the one-way ANOVA result was significant.

Cell Aggregates
Algc particles (with PLL
or PLLF coating) were cocultured with the HepG2 cells at
cell-to-particle ratios of 25/1 and 10/1 in 96-well plates with an
ultralow attachment surface (Dow Corning, Inc) with 22 500
cells per well in 300 μL of cell medium for 24 h, 3 d, and 7
d. Cell-only samples were prepared as a control. The cell medium was
exchanged every 2 d. Further, the cocultures were imaged using the
inverted Olympus microscope, and the sizes of the 3D tissue were measured.
To visualize the integration of the microreactors into the HepG2 cell
aggregates, cocultures after fixing and staining with DAPI and phalloidin
were imaged using CLSM. All cell experiments were performed in at
least three independent repeats.

Cell Viability (Cell Aggregates)
Three-dimensional
tissue formed after 24 h, 3 d, and 7 d from cell-to-particle ratios
25/1 and 10/1, and only cells were stained by incubation at RT for
5 min with FDA (8 μg mL–1) and PI (20 μg
mL–1), followed by visualization using CLSM. The
dead-cell fraction was calculated based on the confocal images of
two different images within the three independent repeats of days
3 and 7. Because the number of live and dead cells could not be counted
on single slices of the CLSM images, the area of the live (green channel)
and dead cells (red channel) was calculated using the ImageJ software.
To account for the area difference between live and dead cells, as
the stained nucleus of a dead cell is smaller than the stained area
of a living cell, the area of the live cell fraction was divided by
a factor of 3 (rough approximation). The dead-cell fraction was then
calculated based on these areas. The statistical significance used
to compare the distribution was determined using a one-way ANOVA with
a confidence level of 99.9%.

Detoxification (Cell Aggregates)
Cell medium (100 μL)
containing 22 500 cells and microreactors (Algc or
Algcat) in a ratio of 25/1 or 10/1 was added per well in a 96-well
plate with an ultralow attachment surface and let to incubate for
24 h. Then, 100 μL of fresh cell medium containing different
amounts of H2O2 (0–2 mM) was added to
each well. After 24 h incubation, the cell viability was assessed
by replacing the cell medium with 120 μL of cell medium supplemented
with 10 v % CCK-8. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the absorption was measured in a multiplate reader. Three
independent repeats in triplicates were performed. The statistical
significance used to compare the distribution was determined using
a one-way ANOVA with a confidence level of 95%, followed by a Tukey’s
post hoc test if the one-way ANOVA result was significant.
