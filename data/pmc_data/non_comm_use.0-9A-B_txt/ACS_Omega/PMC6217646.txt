We introduce a droplet-based biomolecular
detection platform using
robust, versatile, and low-cost superhydrophilic patterned superhydrophobic
surfaces. Benefitting from confinement and evaporation-induced shrinkage
of droplets on wetted patterns, we show enrichment-based biomolecular
detection using very low sample volumes. First, we developed a glucose
assay using fluorescent polydopamine (PDA) based on enhancement of
PDA emission by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced
in enzyme-mediated glucose oxidation reaction. Incubation in evaporating
droplets resulted in brighter fluorescence compared to that in bulk
solutions. Droplet assay was highly sensitive toward increasing glucose
concentration while that in milliliter-volume solutions resulted in
no fluorescence enhancement at similar time scales. This is due to
droplet evaporation that increased the reaction rate by causing enrichment
of PDA and glucose/glucose oxidase as well as increased concentration
of H2O2 generated in shrinking droplet. Second,
we chemically functionalized wetted patterns with single-stranded
DNA and developed fluorescence-based DNA detection to demonstrate
the adaptability of the patterned surfaces for a different class of
assay. We achieved detection of glucose and DNA with concentration
down to 130 μM and 200 fM, respectively. Patterned superhydrophobic
surfaces with their simple production, sensitive response, and versatility
present potential for bioanalysis from low sample volumes.

Introduction
Superhydrophobic surfaces
patterned with well-defined wetted patterns
have been important for high-throughput biological and chemical screening
inside droplets placed on top since they provide increased reaction
rates and sensing signals.1 Microscale
droplets are confined on superhydrophilic patterns due to wetting
contrast between hydrophilic patterns and hydrophobic areas.2 Upon evaporation of droplets, substances dispersed
in droplets enrich, which increases molecular interaction frequencies.
Such an enrichment effect increases reaction rates, providing enhanced
detection signals, whereas signals remain too low to be detected in
low-concentration samples.3 A few reports
have demonstrated detection of DNA, RNA, protein, and bacteria inside
stationary droplets by exploiting high sensitivity advantage of evaporation-induced
enrichment effect.3−8 Here, to obtain a practical platform for droplet-based assays, we
present the use of superhydrophobic organically modified silica-coated
surfaces with circular superhydrophilic patterns generated by converting
surface-bound methyl groups into hydroxyl groups via UV/ozone treatment.
Two-dimensional chemical patterning without physical decomposition
resulted in isolation of aqueous droplets in small wetted spots (Figure 1). These surfaces
provide a very strong contrast between wetting and nonwetting regions.
Additionally, they can be generated with high precision and they are
suitable for large-area processing and stable at a wide range of temperature.9,10 Here, we show the versatility of these surfaces using two types
of assays, which are based on different chemistries, a novel glucose
sensing assay and a DNA hybridization assay.

circular pattern of a superhydrophobic ormosil surface and evaporation-induced
enrichment of low-concentration, low-volume fluorescent sample and
resulting fluorescence enhancement.

Hernandez-Perez et al. have recently developed a micropillar-based
platform and have shown that 2.5 mM glucose can be detected in evaporating
droplets placed on pillars. They used horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/glucose
oxidase (GOx)/chromogen as the sensing probe.11 However, HRP has some drawbacks, such as high cost and instability.
Therefore, various peroxidase-mimicking nanomaterials have been introduced,
including quantum dots, metal nanoclusters, and dyes. Conjugated polymers
have also been used as peroxidase-mimicking nanomaterials based on
direct or indirect interactions between H2O2 and polymer backbones.12,13 Although such materials
exhibit high sensitivity for glucose detection, they usually involve
complicated synthesis steps14,15 and toxicity. Contrary
to these materials, polydopamine (PDA) can be easily produced through
oxidation and self-polymerization of dopamine in alkaline environments.
Particularly, PDA fluorescence has recently found applications in
bioimaging and dopamine sensing.16−18 Here, we used fluorescent
PDA for droplet-based glucose sensing probe, which is another major
contribution of this work. A sensitive glucose assay was prepared
by combining the advantages of PDA, such as biocompatibility and ease
of production with analyte/product-enriching capability of patterned
surfaces.

PDA fluorescence is known to enhance due to decomposition
of its
stacked chain structure by H2O2, which is produced
in glucose oxidation reaction. To the best of our knowledge, we have
exploited PDA as glucose probe for the first time. We first produced
PDA from dopamine and incubated with glucose/GOx inside microdroplets
placed on wetted patterns. After droplet evaporation, aggregated PDA
on the patterns radiated bright fluorescence, which was observed to
increase with increasing glucose concentration. However, when incubated
in milliliter-volume bulk solution, no significant fluorescence enhancement
was obtained within the same time (∼50 min). Fast fluorescence
enhancement and stronger signals on patterns revealed increase of
reaction rate and sensitivity in evaporating droplets.

As a
second assay geared toward molecular diagnostics, we functionalized
wetted patterns with single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and performed fluorescence-based
DNA sensing in evaporating microdroplets. Hybridization of target
and probe DNA strands inside droplets resulted in higher fluorescence
intensities compared to milliliter-volume solution, where no enrichment
occurred. Fluorescence of hybridized DNA with concentration as low
as 200 fM was detected thanks to the enrichment effect of patterned
surfaces.

Results and Discussion
Superhydrophilic–superhydrophobic
patterned surfaces were
produced using a one-pot sol–gel method, followed by UV/ozone
treatment on the positions defined (see Materials
and Methods section for details). Superhydrophobic coatings
were composed of methyl (CH3)-modified nanoparticles, which
were organized in a porous and rough network (Figure 2a). The contact angle of superhydrophobic
surfaces was 169° (Figure S1). Superwetted
spots with diameter of 0.9 or 1.4 mm were generated on as-prepared
superhydrophobic surfaces. To obtain these spots, surfaces were aligned
under a shadow mask with holes formed by laser cutting system and
treated with UV/ozone, which decomposed hydrophobic CH3 groups, leaving silanol (Si–OH) groups.4 Extreme wettability difference between untreated and UV/ozone-treated
regions led to confinement of microdroplets and solute substances
on small wetted patterns, while droplets were repelled from untreated
area due to superhydrophobicity (Figure 2b). The degree of wettability was tuned depending
on UV/ozone treatment time. The contact angle gradually decreased
with increasing treatment time and surface became superhydrophilic
upon 40 min treatment (Figure S2). To obtain
evaporation-induced droplet confinement, time-dependent contact angle
on a pattern was measured. A 20 μL droplet drop-cast onto pattern
was initially quasi-spherical due to the superhydrophobicity of the
surrounding pattern (Figure 2c). Upon evaporation, the contact angle gradually decreased
due to reduced volume and the droplet was finally evaporated.

was confined on the wetted area, whereas it was repelled from the
nonwetted part and maintained its spherical shape due to low surface
energy. (c) Time-dependent contact angle profile of a water droplet

We incubated PDA with glucose solution with concentration
ranging
from 1 to 50 mM in 20 μL of evaporating droplets (see Materials and Methods section for details). Fluorescence
intensities were recorded after droplets were evaporated, which took
approximately 50 min at 37 °C. PDA, which is formed through oxidation
and polymerization of dopamine, yields weak green broad-band fluorescence
in the wavelength range of 430–600 nm (Figure 3a). Dopamine oxidation produces oligomers,
which self-assemble and form PDA through π–π* stacking
interactions.19,20 Increased π–π*
interactions result in aggregation-induced quenching in the course
of time (Figure S3).21 When treated with H2O2, PDA fluorescence
is found to turn on due to decomposition of PDA polymer to nanoaggregates
by H2O2.22−24 Accordingly, PDA fluorescence
was increased with increasing glucose concentration due to H2O2 generated through glucose oxidation (Figure 3a,b). Furthermore, enhancement
of PDA fluorescence was also observed by the naked eye under UV light
(Figure 3c). Interestingly,
fluorescence maximum was shifted to blue (470 nm) in the presence
of glucose with concentration above 5 mM, revealing reduction of nanoaggregate
size with gradual increase of H2O2.25 We investigated the effect of H2O2 on PDA fluorescence. Besides increasing fluorescence intensity,
fluorescence maximum was observed to shift from 500 to 470 nm with
increasing H2O2 (Figure S4). The limit of detection of fluorescence-based glucose assay
was calculated to be 130 μM by plotting the linear calibration
curve (inset of Figure 3b).

ranging from 1 to 50 mM in evaporating microdroplets on wetted patterns.
(b) Fluorescence intensities at 470 nm plotted with data in (a). The
inset shows linear calibration curve in the range of 1–10 mM.
The error bars show 1 standard deviation of three measurements. (c)
Photographs of fluorescent PDA spots excited by UV light (366 nm)

Although fluorescence enhancement was also observed
in bulk liquid,
where insignificant evaporation occurs, the reaction was much slower.
To investigate the same reaction in bulk, fluorescence intensities
were recorded after incubating PDA with glucose/GOx in 4 mL of buffer
solutions at 37 °C. Figure 4 shows time dependence of fluorescence intensity at
500 nm. During the initial stages of PDA growth, dopamine emission
centered at 460 nm was observed besides PDA emission centered around
500 nm and then gradually disappeared (Figure S5). After the addition of dopamine to oxidized glucose, different
fluorescence intensities were recorded for different glucose concentrations.
However, enhancement response was observed with increasing glucose
concentration only after 4 h incubation (Figure 4). Until 4 h incubation, there is no correlation
between the glucose concentration and fluorescence intensity at 500
nm. This result can be explained by the suppression of PDA formation
soon after dopamine addition to oxidized glucose when H2O2 amount is high. Reorganization of PDA nanoclusters
through π–π* stacking interactions in the course
of time resulted in fluorescence enhancement. Droplet-based assay
accelerated reaction between PDA and H2O2, and
reduced the required time to 50 min from 4 h to generate
fluorescent enhancement for a wide range of glucose concentration
from 1 to 50 mM. Dopamine emission was not observed in evaporating
droplets due to high PDA growth rate. It is important to
note that shift of fluorescence maximum was not observed in the
bulk liquid, revealing the inefficient interaction with H2O2.

incubation with glucose with concentration ranging from 1 to 50 mM

is given in the Supporting Information.

Besides glucose detection, patterned
surfaces were also used for
droplet-based DNA detection. First, probe DNA was covalently attached
to wetted patterns using silane chemistry (see Materials
and Methods section for details). Briefly, wetted patterns
were first epoxylated with (3-glycidoxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPTS)
and then amine-ended DNA molecules were anchored to epoxy groups in
sodium carbonate buffer with pH 9 (Figure 5a). Surfaces were washed with bovine serum
albumin (BSA) solution to remove the unbound DNA molecules. Binding
of GOPTS and DNA to UV/ozone-treated patterns was analyzed by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. C 1s spectrum of UV/ozone-treated areas
showed the decomposition of CH3 groups (Figure S6). Peaks at 286.7 and 287.7 eV confirmed epoxysilane
binding, whereas peaks at 285.4 and 286.6 eV and increase of carbon
intensities revealed DNA binding (Figure S7).26 Binding of probe DNA was also monitored
with confocal microscopy using Cy5 tagging. Red emission of Cy5 collected
from porous ormosil network shows that probe DNA uniformly bonded
all over the epoxy-functionalized silica nanoparticles on wetted pattern
(Figure 5b).

hybridization of probe DNA with 20 pM Cy3-tagged target DNA in 4 μL

Droplets (4 μL) including Cy3-tagged 200 fM, 20 pM,
and 200
pM target DNA were added to probe-bound patterns and left to incubate
while evaporating in the meantime. After washing with BSA and phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solutions, emission intensities were analyzed with confocal
microscopy. Figure 5c shows fluorescence signal collected from a spot hybridized with
20 pM target DNA. In addition, hybridization was performed in bulk
solution. A patterned surface with probe DNA anchored on 0.9 mm pattern
was immersed in 2 mL of 20 pM target DNA solution and left to incubate.
Fluorescence signal obtained in droplet-based assay was 2 orders of
magnitude higher than that in solution-based assay (Figure 6). Hybridization signal for
noncomplementary DNA was at the same level with buffer solution revealing
the specificity of the biosensor for target DNA (Figure 6). Detection of DNA as low
as 200 fM was achieved in the assay.

confocal images of patterns

bulk solution of 20 pM complementary DNA.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated a simple detection
platform for glucose
and DNA assays by using superhydrophilic–superhydrophobic patterned
surfaces. A simple UV/ozone-based chemical treatment was used to generate
wetted patterns on superhydrophobic coatings produced via sol–gel
method. Aqueous droplets with very small volume can be confined on
wetted patterns. Analytes dissolved in droplets can be enriched upon
evaporation of microdroplets, which are confined on wetted patterns.
Polydopamine (PDA) was used as a single fluorescent probe for glucose,
for the first time in this study, by benefitting from H2O2-dependent fluorescent enhancement of PDA. A glucose
assay with reduced response time and increased sensitivity was obtained
due to enrichment-induced increase of reaction rates. Contrary to
droplet-based assay, fluorescence enhancement was very slow in bulk
solutions. Glucose detection with concentration ranging from 1 to
50 mM was shown using bright PDA fluorescence, which can also be observed
by the naked eye. PDA with its biocompatibility and promising response
curve shows potential for replacing the HRP/chromogen indicators in
glucose sensors, especially for wearable and implantable sensors.
Furthermore, wetted patterns were functionalized with DNA strands
and were used for droplet-based DNA analysis using very low sample
volumes. Target DNA with concentration as low as 200 fM can be detected
by means of enrichment effect. The presented versatile patterned
surfaces with their simple production scheme have potential for a
wide range of biochemical analysis.

Preparation of Superhydrophilic–Superhydrophobic
Patterned
Surfaces
Superhydrophobic coatings were prepared using previously
reported sol–gel method.9 MTMS (1
mL) was dissolved in 9.74 mL of methanol. Following 15 min stirring,
0.5 mL of 1 mM oxalic acid solution was added dropwise and the solution
was gently stirred for 30 min. Then, the mixture was left to hydrolyze
organosilane precursor completely for 24 h at room temperature. After
the hydrolysis step, 0.19 mL of water and 0.42 mL of ammonia solution
(25%) were added and gently stirred for 15 min. The resultant mixture
was left for 2 days at room temperature to obtain a complete gel.
After the aging step, 9 mL of methanol was added, followed by homogenization
using an ultrasonic liquid processor for 45 s at 20 W. Portions of
resultant colloidal silica solution (250 mL) were spin-coated onto
clean quartz or glass substrates (1 × 2 cm2) at 3000
rpm for 45 s. The as-prepared surfaces were covered with cellulose
acetate sheets, on which circular holes with 0.9 or 1.4 mm diameter were
formed using a 30 W CO2 laser cutter system (Epilog Zing).
Covered surfaces were exposed to UV/ozone for 60 min using a
surface cleaning system (PSD-UV, Novascan Technologies) to convert
exposed superhydrophobic regions to superhydrophilic. The power intensities
of the UV/ozone cleaner were 8 and 30 mW/cm2 for 185 and
253.7 nm wavelengths, respectively.

Characterizations
Static water contact angles of surfaces
were measured with a contact angle meter (OCA 30, DataPhysics). Water
droplets (20 μL) were used for the measurements. The Laplace–Young
equation was used for contact angle calculations. Surface morphology
was examined using a scanning electron microscope (Quanta 200F, FEI).
Surface chemistry was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific).

Preparation of Buffer Solutions
PBS (100 mM) was prepared
by dissolving 10 PBS tablets in 200 mL of deionized water, and the
solution pH was adjusted to 7.4 using 1 M sodium hydroxide solution.
Tris solution (50 mM) was prepared and its pH was adjusted to 8.6
using 2 M hydrochloric acid. Sodium carbonate buffer (100 mM) was
prepared and its pH was adjusted to 9.0 using 2 M hydrochloric acid.

Glucose Assay
PBS solutions (2 mL, pH 7.4), including
glucose with concentrations varying from 1 to 50 mM, were mixed with
50 μL of 1 mg/mL GOx solution. Portions of the mixtures (20
μL) were drop-cast onto separate superwetted spots of patterned
surfaces and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For bulk assay, the
solutions were directly incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Dopamine
in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.6) with a final dopamine concentration
of 0.5 mM was added to the glucose–GOx mixtures. For droplet
assay, 20 μL portions of dopamine were added and incubated until
droplets were completely evaporated, which took approximately 50 min.
The assay time is a function of the hydrophilic spot size, droplet
size, and evaporation rate, which should be optimized for any given
assay. For bulk assay, dopamine and glucose–GOx mixtures were
incubated at 37 °C up to 5 h. A control sample containing GOx
enzyme without glucose was also prepared and incubated as all other
samples.

DNA Assay
Patterned surfaces were immersed in ethanol
solution containing 2% (v/v) GOPTS and incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Then, the surfaces were washed with ethanol several times, followed
by drying at 120 °C for 1 h. Portions (4 μL) of 1 μM
probe DNA (Cy5-tagged or tag-free) in sodium carbonate buffer solutions
(pH 9.0) were drop-cast onto superwetted spots. After incubation at
37 °C for 4 h in a closed chamber humidified around 80%, the
surfaces were washed with PBS solutions (pH 7.4) to remove the unbound
probe DNA strands. The surfaces were then washed with PBS, followed
by washing with 1% BSA–PBS solution and MB grade water. Target
DNA (4 μL; 200 fM, 20 pM, and 200 pM) in PBS solutions were
drop-cast onto probe-bound spots. Microdroplets were left to incubate
in the dark at 37 °C for 2 h in a closed chamber with 40% humidity.
The surfaces were then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and MB grade water
and dried with nitrogen blow.

FluorescenceMeasurements
Fluorescence intensities of
droplets and bulk glucose assays were analyzed using a UV lamp (366
nm, 8W, CAMAG) and a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA, Fluorolog-3,
450 W) by exciting samples at 400 nm and collecting intensities within
the 420–600 nm range. Fluorescent images of droplet-based DNA
assay were taken using a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss using
10× objective. Helium lasers at 543 and 633 nm were used for
excitation. Emissions at around 570 and 650 nm were collected for
Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.
