The photocatalytic
degradation of organic molecules is one of the
effective ways for water purification. At this point, photocatalytic
microreactor systems seem to be promising to enhance the versatility
of the photoassisted degradation approach. Herein, we propose photoresponsive
microcapsules prepared via layer-by-layer assembly of polyelectrolytes
on the novel CaCO3/TiO2 composite template cores.
The preparation of CaCO3/TiO2 composite particles
is challenging because of the poor compatibility of TiO2 and CaCO3 in an aqueous medium. To prepare stable CaCO3/TiO2 composites, TiO2 nanoparticles
were loaded into mesoporous CaCO3 microparticles with a
freezing-induced loading technique. The inclusion of TiO2 nanoparticles into CaCO3 templates was evaluated with
scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis with respect to
their type, concentration, and number of loading iterations. Upon
polyelectrolyte shell assembly, the CaCO3 matrix was dissolved,
resulting in microreactor capsules loaded with TiO2 nanoparticles.
The photoresponsive properties of the resulted capsules were tested
by photoinduced degradation of the low-molecule dye rhodamine B in
aqueous solution and fluorescently labeled polymer molecules absorbed
on the capsule surface under UV light. The exposure of the capsules
to UV light resulted in a pronounced degradation of rhodamine B in
capsule microvolume and fluorescent molecules on the capsule surface.
Finally, the versatility of preparation of multifunctional photocatalytic
and magnetically responsive capsules was demonstrated by iterative
freezing-induced loading of TiO2 and magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles into CaCO3 templates.

==== Body
Introduction
The development of
novel effective systems to degrade water pollutants
and bacterial contamination is an essential task of modern chemistry.
Photoassisted catalytic degradation of organic compounds in the presence
of titanium dioxide appears to be a promising approach to wastewater
treatment, disinfection, antifouling, and elimination of various pollutants.
TiO2 nanoparticles possess unique photocatalytic properties1 for the decomposition of organic and inorganic
waste,2 deactivation of viruses,3 bacteria,4 microfungi
and microalgae, and destruction of cancer cells.5 On the other hand, the employment of bare TiO2 particles remains unfavorable with respect to practical applications.6 One way to enhance the safety and selectivity
of photoinduced decomposition with TiO2 particles is to
encapsulate them into photoactive microcontainers.7 From this point, the hybrid8 microcapsules were prepared via layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly9 on the template cores10 appear the most promising as they suggest several ways to improve
photocatalytic efficiency. The first one is the composite containers
locally increase the concentration of the TiO2 particles
and the pollutant in the given microvolume.11 The pollutant may absorb on the container surface or diffuse into
the cavity. Second, the controllable stepwise assembly allows to adjust
the structure, chemical, and functional properties of the capsules,
opening a broad avenue for their modification. For instance, the capsules
may be modified with self-assembled layers of organic molecules with
various molecular recognition sites to improve the selectivity to
the desired pollutant.12−14 Additionally, the noble metal particles acting as
an electron sink can be enclosed to improve the efficiency of photocatalysis
because of the reduction of charge carrier recombination15,16 and by shifting the spectral maximum of absorption to the visible
band, utilizing more energy to trigger the photocatalytic reaction
from the visible light.17 Finally, the
composite microcontainers can be more easily removed from the purified
water compared to the bare TiO2 particles. The inclusion
of magnetic particles into containers allows for magnetic separation18,19 to remove the containers upon purification, with the possibility
of further recovery and regeneration of the catalyst.

From the
variety of methods to combine the functional nanoparticles
with self-assembled microcapsules, the one resulting in the highest
particle containment is preferable as the efficiency of the photocatalytic
reaction is directly related to the amount of the catalyst.20 Regarding the microcapsules’ assembly,
the freezing-induced loading (FIL) method was shown as an efficient
approach for the loading of inorganic nanoparticles and organic macromolecules
into the pores of template microparticles.21 This approach is based on the successive freezing and thawing of
a mixture of nanoparticle and template core suspension. Additionally,
FIL may be employed for the preparation of complex composite templates
by iterative loading of various functional particles or molecules,
resulting in novel and enhanced properties of assembled capsules.22 From this point, photocatalytic and magnetically
responsive microcapsules might be of interest because of ease of preparation
and removal after the water treatment is carried out.

In this
paper, the FIL method was employed for the first time to
prepare the stable CaCO3/TiO2 composite microparticles
with high TiO2 loading as template cores for the preparation
of multilayered self-assembled microcapsules for photocatalytic degradation
of organic pollutants. The photocatalytic activity of these capsules
was tested in two ways, mimicking possible options for capsules to
be involved in degradation activity. In particular, these are the
decomposition of low-molecular dye under UV light in an aqueous medium
in inner capsule microvolume and decomposition of preabsorbed dye
under UV light onto the capsule surface. Additionally, we have demonstrated
the possibility of preparation of multifunctional microcapsules possessing
photocatalytic and magnetic properties by iterative FIL loading of
TiO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles into
CaCO3 cores.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of CaCO3/TiO2 Composite Microparticles
A comparison
of the measured anatase and P25 anatase + rutile particle
properties is shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). On the one hand, the specific surface of the particles is almost
the same and, therefore, should not affect their comparative photocatalytic
activity. On the other hand, according to dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements, anatase particles tend to form larger aggregates
in the aqueous medium compared to P25 anatase + rutile particles (Figure 1a), which can be
related to their lower ζ-potential (5.5 and 17.8 mV, respectively,
under pH 5, Figure 1b).

Figure 1 TiO2 nanoparticle size distribution measured by DLS
(a), ζ-potential (b), and time dependence of the sedimentation
stability of anatase and P25 anatase + rutile nanoparticle suspension
(c).

Figure 1c demonstrates
the time dependence of the sedimentation stability of nanoparticles
in the aqueous medium estimated with respect to particle suspension
transmittance. The inset shows the scheme of the experiment. The transmittance
of the anatase particle solution climbs from 50% to almost 100% in
10 min, indicating that most of the particles passed the laser line
and sedimented on the cuvette bottom. In contrast, the transmittance
of P25 anatase + rutile particle suspension remains at the same level
(about 3–5%) for 20 min and even further (the measurement was
carried out for 3 h, the data are not shown). Accomplished with the
DLS and ζ-potential data, this indicates that P25 anatase +
rutile nanoparticles are more stable in the aqueous solution.

Mesoporous calcium carbonate microparticles with vaterite structure
are widely used as templates for assembling of multifunctional carriers
because of their high porosity (with an average pore size of 20–70
nm)23 and solubility under mild pH conditions
(pH 7).24 Moreover, the porous nature and
developed surface of CaCO3 microparticles are preferable
in some applications, for example, sensing.25

Currently, the most common methods for the preparation of
vaterite
particles loaded with active agents and inorganic nanoparticles are
the coprecipitation method (encapsulation during particle preparation)26,27 and adsorption from solution.28 Additionally,
the synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles in CaCO3 pores
in situ can be employed,29 yet it is more
complicated and less common. However, as the aqueous dispersion of
TiO2 nanoparticles has a pH of 4.5–5,30 and the formation of vaterite particles occurs
in alkaline medium, it is challenging to obtain CaCO3/TiO2 composites using these methods. Figure 2a,b shows the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the resulted CaCO3/TiO2 particles
prepared with the coprecipitation technique. The addition of TiO2 suspension with acidic pH during the CaCO3 nucleation
leads to the formation of cubic calcite microparticles that are not
suitable for further capsule preparation.

Figure 2 SEM images of CaCO3 microparticles loaded with TiO2 nanoparticles
by coprecipitation of anatase (a) and P25 anatase
+ rutile (b) and by adsorption of anatase (c) and P25 anatase + rutile
(d). The scale bars correspond to 5 μm.

The attempt to adsorb the TiO2 nanoparticles on vaterite
templates (the SEM image of the initial vaterite template is shown
in Figure S3, Supporting Information) from
aqueous solution resulted in a clear separation of micro- and nanoparticles
(Figure 2c,d). This
can be explained by the fact that both CaCO3 and TiO2 particles in an aqueous medium under pH 7 are charged slightly
negatively30,31 and, therefore, their adsorption
is hardly possible because of electrostatic repulsion.

In turn,
FIL implies the pushing off of TiO2 and CaCO3 particles in aqueous solution by the moving of the water
crystallization front during controllable freezing. The particles
are concentrated ahead of the crystallization front, reducing the
water freezing point. Finally, upon nano- and microparticles being
concentrated in a given microvolume, the nanoparticles are embedded
into the CaCO3 pores, substituting the residual water under
the growing pressure of the ice front.

Figure 3a,b demonstrates
the SEM images of the CaCO3/TiO2 particles prepared
by FIL under various conditions as described in Table 1 in the Experimental Section. The images show that the visual appearance of the FIL-loaded CaCO3 templates varies depending on the type and concentration
of TiO2 nanoparticles. This is the most prominent for the
CaCO3/TiO2 composites with P25 anatase + rutile.
The surface becomes more developed and rougher with an increasing
amount of loaded TiO2 (Figure 3b) unlike the composites with anatase (Figure 3a).

with (a) anatase (A1–A4) and (b) P25 anatase + rutile (B1 –

main images and to 500 nm on the insets. (c) Relative distribution

The amount of Ti in the composite particles
was estimated with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. Although EDX
is a semiquantitative method and cannot provide direct information
on the loading efficiency of TiO2 nanoparticles, it is
still useful for comparative sample analysis with respect to the percentage
of Ti atoms relative to the total number of atoms in the region of
interest. According to EDX data (SEM) (Figure 3c), the amount of Ti in the samples loaded
with P25 anatase + rutile nanoparticles (B1–B4) is higher than
that of the samples loaded with anatase nanoparticles (A1–A4).
This can be attributed to the lower loading of anatase into CaCO3 particles as the anatase is less stable in an aqueous medium.
Noticeably, the amount of Ti in A2 and A3 samples is almost the same
(within a margin of error) as in B2 and B3 samples. Therefore, it
can be concluded that the loading efficiency of the TiO2 nanoparticles with FIL is defined by the total amount of loaded
particles and can be adjusted by the concentration and/or the number
of loading cycles (within the particle concentration range used in
this work).

Figure 3d shows
the HR-STEM cross-sectional image of the CaCO3/TiO2 B4 composite microparticle merged with an energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy system (EDXS) map of the volume and near-surface
area. The HR-STEM confirms a highly porous structure of CaCO3 particles with the pore density decreasing from the center to the
particle surface. The EDXS map reveals that the distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles over the CaCO3 microparticle surface
is rather nonuniform. The nanoparticles are mainly located in the
surface layer of 100 nm; however, in some areas, the depth of particle
penetration reaches up to 400 nm (highlighted with a red dotted line),
which is confirmed by the elemental analysis.

Preparation of UV-Responsive
Microcontainers and Decomposition
of the Low-Molecular Dye
The polyelectrolyte shells were
assembled on the prepared composite CaCO3/TiO2 particles by the LbL method. The shells were assembled of poly(allylamine
hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(4-styrenesulfonate)sodium salt (PSS)
polyelectrolytes because of the good stability and well-established
properties of the resulted polyelectrolyte complex. As the shell is
assembled and the CaCO3 matrix is removed, the TiO2 nanoparticles anchored onto the inner layer of the polyelectrolyte
shell. The polyelectrolyte shell is permeable for low-molecular compounds,
allowing for their photocatalytic degradation in the container microvolume
directly on contact with preconcentrated TiO2 particles.

Figure 4a,b demonstrates
the SEM images of the capsules assembled on the CaCO3/TiO2 composite cores after the dissolution of the CaCO3 matrix. Compared to the control PAH/PSS capsules (Figure 4c), the surface of TiO2-loaded capsules becomes rougher and TiO2 particle
aggregates can be seen inside the capsule shells. This correlates
with the data of EDX analysis, indicating the growth of Ti amount
in the capsules with the surface roughness and the loading of TiO2 in the initial composite microparticles (Figure 4d). However, the Ti amount
in the resulted capsules is lower than in the corresponding CaCO3/TiO2 composites, which may be related to the desorption
of some number of TiO2 nanoparticles during the shell assembly.
Nevertheless, the overall tendency in the distribution of Ti atoms
depending on the loading and type of TiO2 nanoparticles
remains the same.

a control PAH/PSS capsule assembled on a CaCO3 particle.
The scale bar is 1 μm. (d) Relative distribution of Ti in capsules

To evaluate the photocatalytic
activity in the first set of experiments,
microcapsules loaded with TiO2 nanoparticles were incubated
in the Rho B solution under UV light. Prior to this, the appropriate
UV lamp wavelength was selected. It is known that TiO2 is
an n-type semiconductor.32 The measured
values of the band gap for anatase and P25 anatase + rutile particles
were 2.85 and 3.22 eV, respectively (the absorption spectra and Tauc
plots are given in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The measured band gap for P25 anatase + rutile
is in a good agreement with the reference one of the anatase phase,
which is 3.2 eV.33 On the other hand, the
measured band gap for anatase particles is different, which might
be due to the fast sedimentation of the particles affecting the data
acquisition. Nevertheless, the irradiation with a 367 nm UV lamp (corresponding
to 3.38 eV photon energy) should result in the effective generation
of electron–hole pairs in both types of nanoparticles.

Figure 5a,b,e,f
shows the dependence of relative change of the concentration of Rho
B dye incubated with photoactive microcontainers under UV light and
the percentage of dye decomposition rate. The first point of every
plot corresponds to the absorbance of an as-prepared mixture of capsules
and Rho B, whereas the zero points were measured after 30 min of incubation
without UV irradiation to reach an adsorption equilibrium in the mixture.34 The degradation rate curves (Figure 5b,f) demonstrate the decomposition
of the dye incubated with TiO2-loaded capsules (the standard
plot for Rho B aqueous solution is given in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). For both particle types,
the degradation efficiency depends on the number of loaded particles.
Noticeably, the capsules demonstrate almost the same photocatalytic
activity, except those with minimal loading. Comparing the photocatalytic
efficiency of capsules loaded with anatase and P25 anatase + rutile
nanoparticles, the latter demonstrate more than 50% degradation of
Rho B after 3 h of incubation under UV light, whereas incubation of
the dye solution with anatase-loaded capsules resulted in only 30%
degradation in the same time. This can be associated with better loading
of P25 anatase + rutile particles. Additionally, some studies hypothesized
that anatase with rutile inclusions appears to be more preferable
for photocatalytic applications on comparing to pure anatase.35−37 Although the rutile phase is considered as low-active itself, the
junction between anatase and rutile phases promotes the separation
of charge carriers because of electron migration from rutile to anatase
and hole migration to the surface. The rutile phase plays the role
of a charge separator and provides additional sites for oxidation,
which results in enhanced photocatalytic activity of P25 anatase +
rutile particles.

degradation

light; ln(C/C0) plots
(c) and corresponding reaction rate constants (d) for anatase-loaded
(A1–A4 samples) capsules. The relative change of the concentration

(B1–B4 samples) under UV light; ln(C/C0) plots (g) and corresponding reaction rate
constants (h) for P25 anatase + rutile-loaded (B1–B4 samples)
capsules.

The kinetics of dye decomposition
in aqueous solution is generally
described by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood equation, which also
takes into account the adsorption of the degraded agent onto the catalyst’s
surface.38 At low dye concentrations, the
equation can be written as the first-order kinetics reaction 1  where C0 is an
initial dye concentration, C is a measured dye concentration, k is a pseudo-first-order rate constant, and t is degradation time.39Figure 5c,g shows the semi-log plots
of C0 versus time for the capsules loaded
with two types of TiO2 nanoparticles plotted based on the
degradation rate measurements. The experimental data are well approximated
with a linear fitting curve, which implies the pseudo-first-order
of the degradation kinetics. The reaction constants can be figured
from these plots as slopes of the fitting lines. Figure 5d,h shows the comparison in
reaction constants of the capsules loaded with various numbers and
types of TiO2 nanoparticles. This indicates that the capsules
loaded with P25 anatase + rutile particles have higher photocatalytic
performance compared with capsules loaded with anatase particles.
It is also noticeable that the capsules loaded with the same number
of TiO2 particles (A2/A3 and B2/B3 samples) have the same
photocatalytic performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
resulted photocatalytic efficiency of the photoactive containers depends
on the type and the final number of the TiO2 particles
loaded by FIL, which gives certain adjustability in the container
preparation.

Decomposition of the Fluorescent Label on
the Surface of UV-Responsive
Microcontainers
The prepared photoactive containers are effective
in the decomposition of the small-molecule dye that is able to penetrate
into the capsule microvolume. However, some water treatment applications
require decomposition of large molecules or microorganisms that will
contact mainly the capsule surface. In this regard, it is of interest
to figure out the degradation efficiency of the capsules with respect
to the substances attached to the external layer that are unable to
go inside the capsule volume. For this purpose, TRITC–PAH was
absorbed instead of PAH during the assembly of the finishing capsule
bilayer. The TRITC label was selected as it is known as a fairly photostable
fluorophore under UV light.40

Figure 6 shows the fluorescent
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of the microcapsules
assembled on the regular CaCO3 particles and on the CaCO3/TiO2 composites. The difference in size and shape
of the resulted fluorescent microcontainers assembled on various templates
is clearly seen. The capsules assembled on the control CaCO3 cores (Figure 6a)
demonstrate an almost round shape with prominent fluorescent properties.
In turn, the capsules assembled on the composite CaCO3/TiO2 cores are less spherical because of the roughness of the
initial templates. The difference in size and shape of the capsules
assembled on the initial CaCO3 cores and CaCO3/TiO2 composite cores can be related to the various surface
roughnesses of the templates, which were confirmed by SEM analysis.
In turn, the capsules loaded with anatase and P25 anatase + rutile
nanoparticles have a difference in size and shape as well, which can
be associated with various loading efficiencies of the nanoparticles.
The P25 particles demonstrate better loading and, therefore, the resulted
composite cores have a more developed surface, which can be seen also
by nonuniform adsorption of fluorescently labeled molecules and inhomogeneous
capsule shell thickness. Additionally, the initial CaCO3 particles are not monodisperse intrinsically, which results in capsule
size variation. Moreover, the fluorescent images captured with the
same settings demonstrate a decrease in the fluorescent signal of
the capsules that may be associated with the initiation of fluorophore
photodegradation.

Figure 6 CLSM images of the capsules assembled on various templates:
(a)
control CaCO3, (b) anatase-loaded CaCO3/TiO2 composite (A4 sample), (c) P25 anatase + rutile-loaded CaCO3/TiO2 composite (B4 sample). The scale bar corresponds
to 2 μm.

The collected data on the dye
photodegradation after 3 h under
UV light are shown in Figure 7. Photodegradation curves for all fluorescent capsules loaded
with TiO2 nanoparticles lie below the control curve with
statistical confidence. This indicates that TiO2 nanoparticles
significantly affect the photodegradation process. Noticeably, the
absolute values of the relative change of the concentration of the
degradable fluorescent agent Δc/c for all capsules loaded with P25 anatase + rutile nanoparticles
(Figure 7b) are greater
than that for capsules loaded with anatase (Figure 7a). The Δc/c values are in the range of 10–30% for A1–A4
samples, and in the range of 25–50% for B1–B4 samples
for 1 to 3 h of exposure with UV light. This is comparable with the
degradation rates of small-molecule dye in the capsule volume for
the highest loading of TiO2 particles. However, in the
case of degradation on the surface, the dependence of degradation
on the particle loading is more pronounced.

Figure 7 Relative change of the
concentration of the degradable fluorescent
agent (Δc/c, %) for the capsules
loaded with (a) anatase (A1–A4 samples) and (b) P25 anatase
+ rutile (B1–B4 samples) nanoparticles under UV light.

Preparation of UV-Responsive Magnetic Microcontainers
Finally, the FIL method was employed for iterative loading of CaCO3 templates with TiO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles for the preparation of multifunctional capsules possessing
photocatalytic activity and magnetic responsiveness. To do this, P25
anatase + rutile nanoparticles were used as previous experiments demonstrated
their better stability in an aqueous medium, better loading ability,
and, what is more important, better photocatalytic activity. Figure 8a shows the SEM image
of CaCO3/TiO2/Fe3O4 composite
particle loaded by 1 FIL cycle with P25 anatase + rutile nanoparticles
(1 mg/mL) and by 1 FIL cycle with Fe3O4 nanoparticles.
The morphology and surface roughness of these composites look similar
to those of B4 core samples loaded by 2 FIL cycles with P25 anatase
+ rutile particles (see Figure 3b). The EDX analysis (Figure 8c) shows a relatively high amount of Ti (about 5 at.
%) and Fe (about 4 at. %) atoms in the composite cores. Analogous
to TiO2 loaded capsules, the content of Ti and Fe in the
resulted capsules (Figure 8b) is considerably lower (about 1%) in comparison with initial
composite particles. On the other hand, the content of Ti atoms is
similar to that of the B3 capsule sample prepared with the same TiO2 loading and, considering only the Ti amount, these capsules
should have the same photocatalytic properties.

Figure 8 (a) SEM image of the
CaCO3/TiO2/Fe3O4 composite
particle (scale bar is 2 μm); (b) SEM
image of the capsule assembled on CaCO3/TiO2/Fe3O4 composite particle (scale bar is 1 μm);
(c) relative distribution of Ti and Fe in CaCO3/TiO2/Fe3O4 composite particles and corresponding
capsules measured by EDX (SEM); (d) mobility of the capsules loaded
with TiO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles
in the magnetic field measured as time dependence of the capsule suspension
transparency.

Figure 8d shows
the mobility of the TiO2/Fe3O4-loaded
capsules in the nonuniform magnetic field of a permanent magnet. The
capsule mobility was measured analogous to the experiment on TiO2 particle sedimentation (see Figure 1) except that the gravity field was substituted
with a magnetic field applied alongside the cuvette. The capsule suspension
became almost transparent in about 100 s after the magnetic field
was applied because of the capsule attachment to the cuvette wall
near the magnet. This clearly indicates the response of TiO2/Fe3O4 capsules to the applied magnetic field.

Finally, the photocatalytic properties of TiO2/Fe3O4-loaded capsules were figured out by incubation
of the capsules in the Rho B solution under UV light. Figure 9a,b shows the comparison of
the relative change of the concentration and percentage degradation
curves for TiO2/Fe3O4-loaded capsules
and B3 capsule samples loaded with the same type and amount of TiO2 nanoparticles. The acquired data reveal the concentration
decrease of Rho B incubated with TiO2/Fe3O4-loaded capsules is half as much of those of Rho B incubated
with the B3 sample after 3 h under UV light. The ln(C/C0) plots (Figure 9c) indicate pseudo-first-order kinetics of
dye degradation for TiO2/Fe3O4-loaded
capsules as well, although the figured out reaction constants (Figure 9d) show relatively
low photocatalytic performance in comparison with TiO2-loaded
capsules. This may be related to several points. First, Fe3O4 nanoparticles may absorb part of the light and, thus,
reduce the photocatalytic efficiency. Although Fe3O4 is a semiconductor as well, it was shown that it does not
make a significant impact itself on photocatalytic reaction under
UV or visible light when combined with UV/vis-responsive materials.41 Second, Fe3O4 nanoparticles
may be prone to the so-called photodissolution phenomenon, which results
in growth of recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in
TiO2.42 This can be avoided
by covering Fe3O4 particles with the SiO2 shell.43,44 Furthermore, it should be noted
that the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2/Fe3O4-loaded capsules can be adjusted by additional loading
of TiO2 nanoparticles.

Conclusions
For the first time,
TiO2 nanoparticles were loaded into
mesoporous CaCO3 microparticles with the FIL technique.
Moreover, the FIL method was shown to be only effective for the preparation
of CaCO3/TiO2 composite particles in mild aqueous
conditions and potentially can be extended to any type of nanoparticles
incompatible with CaCO3 in an aqueous medium. The P25 anatase
+ rutile nanoparticles were found to be the most suitable for CaCO3/TiO2 composite preparation. The loading efficiency
of P25 particles was found to be higher than that of anatase that
may be associated with less sedimentation stability of anatase particles
in aqueous solution. The EDXS analysis demonstrated that the nanoparticles
are mostly located in the surface layer with an average penetration
depth of about 100 nm.

The CaCO3/TiO2 composite
particles may be
employed as template cores for the preparation of photoresponsive
polyelectrolyte microcapsules. The inclusion of TiO2 nanoparticles
effectively promotes the photodegradation of rhodamine B fluorescent
dye into the capsule microvolume and TRITC fluorescent label adsorbed
onto the surface bilayer of the capsule shell. Noticeably, the relative
change of the concentration of the degradable fluorescent agent is
higher for the capsules loaded with P25 anatase + rutile particles
rather than anatase-loaded capsules because of the higher photocatalytic
activity of anatase with rutile inclusions. Additionally, multifunctional
photocatalytic and magnetically responsive microcapsules were prepared
by iterative loading of TiO2 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the CaCO3 template. The capsules exhibit
photocatalytic properties and can be easily collected by the magnetic
field for further recovery and regeneration of the catalyst.

The reported data demonstrate the potential of TiO2-loaded
capsules prepared with the FIL method for photoinduced degradation
of organic molecules, bacteria, and other water pollutants either
diffusing into the capsule volume or attaching to their surface. Additionally,
FIL allows for multiple loading of various functional materials and,
thus, the application field may be extended with further capsule modification
and preparation of multifunctional containers, which was demonstrated
by the addition of magnetic nanoparticles. We believe, these capsules
are promising for water treatment applications and antifouling materials.

higher than 18.2 MΩ·cm) from a Milli-Q plus 185 (Millipore)
water purification system was used to make all solutions.

Synthesis of
CaCO3 Microparticles
Spherical
porous CaCO3 microparticles were synthesized as described
by Volodkin et al.45 In particular, 0.615
mL of 1 M CaCl2 and 0.615 mL of 1 M Na2CO3 solutions were injected into 2.5 mL of DI water under vigorous
stirring. After 1 min, the stirring was stopped and the resulted suspension
of particles was separated by centrifugation and washed two times
with DI water. The resulted microparticles had a spherical shape with
an average size of 2.8 ± 0.4 μm.

Synthesis of Magnetite
Nanoparticles
Magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(MNPs) were prepared by coprecipitation
of Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts in the alkaline medium
as described by Massart.46 A homemade automated
reactor setup was employed for nanoparticle synthesis.47 This setup provides precise remote control over
delivered components in the reaction chamber and preserves the inert
atmosphere during synthesis. As-prepared nanoparticles were stabilized
with 0.1 M citric acid and dialyzed in DI water for 4 days at room
temperature. The concentration of the resulted colloid was found to
be 0.98 mg/mL as measured by the colorimetric titration which is based
on the reaction of iron(III) ions with SCN– and
ferric rhodanidecomplexes formation. The average size of the nanoparticles
measured by the DLS method was 11 ± 3 nm.

Preparation of CaCO3/TiO2 and CaCO3/TiO2/MNPs
Composite Microparticles with FIL
To prepare CaCO3/TiO2 composites, 2 mL of
an aqueous suspension of TiO2 nanoparticles with different
concentrations (0.5 and 1 mg/mL) was added to 40 mg of CaCO3 cores. The mixture was placed in a freezer (−20 °C)
in a continuously rotating flask for 2 h to ensure the water is completely
frozen. After freezing, the samples were thawed at room temperature
and rinsed with DI water. Then, the samples were dried (60 °C)
or were sent to a repeated freezing/thawing procedure (a loading cycle).
The loading was carried out for one and two cycles for each type of
TiO2 nanoparticles. Two groups of composite CaCO3/TiO2 cores loaded with each type of TiO2 particles
were prepared for this study as listed in Table 1, where A1–A4 are the composites loaded
with anatase nanoparticles, whereas B1–B4 the ones loaded with
P25 anatase + rutile nanoparticles.

To prepare CaCO3/TiO2/Fe3O4 composites, B3 samples
were additionally loaded with MNPs by FIL as well. To do this, 2 mL
of Fe3O4 nanoparticle suspension was added to
CaCO3/TiO2 composite particles and the mixture
was again placed in a freezer for 2 h, thawed, rinsed with DI water,
and dried (60 °C).

CaCO3/TiO2 composites
were also prepared
by coprecipitation27 and adsorption from
solution methods48 for comparison with
FIL. For coprecipitation, 0.615 mL of 1 M CaCl2 and 0.615
mL of 1 M Na2CO3 solutions were injected into
2.5 mL of titanium dioxide aqueous suspension with the concentration
of 1 mg/mL under vigorous stirring. After 1 min, the stirring was
stopped and the resulted suspension of particles was separated by
centrifugation and washed two times with DI water. To obtain CaCO3/TiO2 composites by the adsorption method, 40 mg
of CaCO3 microparticles were suspended in 2 mL of titanium
dioxide aqueous suspension with a concentration of 1 mg/mL. After
40 min of incubation, the particles were washed three times with DI
water. After washing all types of particles were dried.

Synthesis of
Polyelectrolyte Composite Microcapsules
Synthesis of polyelectrolyte
composite microcapsules was carried
out according to Sukhorukov et al.49 Alternating
adsorption of polyelectrolytes (PAH and PSS, 1 mg/mL in 0.15 M NaCl)
onto the CaCO3/TiO2 microparticles was carried
out for 15 min with each layer followed by three DI rinsing/centrifugation
steps (1 min, 1500 rcf). After assembly of four PAH/PSS bilayers,
the CaCO3 was dissolved with 0.1 M HCl, which resulted
in the formation of composite PAH/PSS capsules loaded with TiO2 nanoparticles. The HCl solution can be safely used to remove
CaCO3 because of the absence of the specific sorption of
Cl– ions onto the surface of TiO2 particles.30 In the same manner, the shell was assembled
onto CaCO3/TiO2/Fe3O4 cores.
The control samples were assembled on regular CaCO3 cores
with the same shell structure. To study the photodegradation on the
capsule surface, the PAH in the finishing bilayer was substituted
for the TRITC–PAH deposited from 1 mg/mL in a 0.15 M NaCl solution.

Hydrodynamic Diameter of Nanoparticles
The hydrodynamic
diameter of nanoparticles was measured by DLS with a Zetasizer Nano
ZS analyzer (Malvern Instruments Co, United Kingdom).

Stability of
Aqueous Suspensions
The stability of aqueous
suspensions was estimated with respect to a sedimentation ratio measured
with the homemade setup analogous to the one described in ref (21). In particular, a quartz
cuvette was filled with 3 mL of aqueous nanoparticle suspension with
a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The measured pH value was 6.2 for anatase
and 6.5 for P25 anatase + rutile particle suspensions. The cuvette
was placed between the laser diode and photodetector in a way that
the laser light passed through the cuvette parallel to the air/water
interface. The device measured the time dependence of the suspension
transparency increasing along with the particle sedimentation. Prior
to measurement, the nanoparticle suspensions were redispersed with
a horn ultrasound (Bandelin, Germany) for 1 min. The ultrasound source
operates at 20 kHz with a power density of 1 W/cm2.

Surface
Morphology (SEM) and Elemental Analysis (EDX)
Surface morphology
(SEM) and elemental analysis (EDX) were performed
with a MIRA II LMU scanning electron microscope (Tescan, Brno, Czech
Republic) equipped with the INCA Energy 350 energy-dispersive microanalysis
system.

(TEM) and (STEM)
Transmission (TEM) and scanning/transmission
(STEM) electron microscopy imaging was performed with a Titan 80-300
TEM/STEM (FEI, USA) electron microscope equipped with a Schottky field
emission gun, spherical aberration corrector (Cs probe corrector)
and EDXS (EDAX, USA).

Absorption Spectra
The absorption
spectra of TiO2 suspensions were measured with a Shimadzu
UV-1800 spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, Japan) with an acquisition step of 1 nm. The measured UV–vis
absorption spectra were further processed to estimate the band gap
of anatase and P25 anatase + rutile particles by Tauc plot of (hνα)2 versus (hν)
and extrapolation of linear plot region to the energy axis.50 α is the absorption coefficient that is
calculated from the measured absorbance A as α
= 2.303A/d, where d is the path length of the cuvette (1 cm).51

Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
CLSM images were
obtained with a Leica TCS SP8 X (Leica, Germany) microscope equipped
with immersion objective ×100 (numerical aperture of 1.44). A
552-nm laser was used to excite the TRITC–PAH fluorescence.

Photocatalytic Properties of TiO2 Loaded Microcapsules
The photocatalytic properties of TiO2-loaded microcapsules
were evaluated under UV light of Camelion LH9-U 9W lamp (λ =
367 nm, the spectrum is given in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). To do this, the capsules were mixed
with Rho B solution (0.01 mg/mL) and dispensed in a 96-well plate
that was constantly shacked by a mini-shaker with a speed of 260 rpm.
The lamp was set 5 cm above the irradiated surface, whereas the irradiated
area of the single well was 38.5 mm2. The absorption spectra
of Rho B and the capsule mixture were measured using the Synergy H1
Multi-Mode Reader UV–vis spectrometer (BioTek Instruments,
Inc., USA). The data were collected before UV exposure and after every
30 min of irradiation, whereas the total irradiation time was 3 h.
The absorption spectra were measured from 480 to 620 nm range with
a 1 nm step. The same experiment was carried out with aqueous suspension
of TRITC-labeled capsules.

Afterward, the obtained data were
processed with the standard data processing software and were presented
as dependences of the relative absorbance change (ΔA/A) on the irradiation time. The time dependence
of ΔA/A was derived as the
ratio of the absorbance intensity change measured before and after
irradiation to the initial absorbance intensity 2  where A is absorbance measured
before UV exposure, whereas Aafter is
that measured after UV exposure, Δc/c is a relative change of the degradable fluorescent agent
concentration. The values were figured out as an absolute peak magnitude
at 560 nm. According to the Beer–Lambert law, the absorbance
is directly related to the concentration (except extremely low or
high analyte concentrations), and, therefore, the measured time dependence
of ΔA/A can be associated
with the relative change of the concentration Δc/c of the degradable fluorescent agent.

Additionally,
the percentage of degradation of Rho B was figured
out. To do this, the Rho B standard plot was measured first. Afterward,
the corresponding decrease in Rho B concentration depending on the
UV irradiation time was plotted.
