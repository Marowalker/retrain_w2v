Annealing strategies for the citrate
complexation–combustion
method have been explored as a simple approach for improving the catalytic
activity of mixed Cr–Mn oxides for the NH3-selective
catalytic reduction of NOx. Materials
prepared at 300 and 400 °C possess largely amorphous structures,
consistent with highly dispersed Cr/Mn components. Annealing at 300
°C for 10 h facilitates the formation of catalysts possessing
the largest surface area, reducibility, acidity, and activity window
(92–239 °C), while areal activity is measured at 3.8 nmol
s–1 m–2 and is comparable to values
obtained for materials prepared at 400 °C. Conversely, shorter
annealing times of 1 and 5 h at 300 °C produce materials that
transform NOx about 2–3 times faster
at equivalent surface area. Characterization demonstrates that simple
annealing strategies have significant impact on the physiochemical
and textural properties of these materials. Moreover, reducibility,
Oα species, and acidity were correlated against areal
activity, but only the latter exhibited a near-linear correlation,
indicating its dominance in controlling surface reaction rates.

1 Introduction
Rapid industrial development
coupled with the increasing demand
and consumption of petrochemical products has led to substantial increase
in atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx: NO,
NO2, and N2O). The aforementioned emissions
generate acid rain, photochemical smog, and, in some instances, possess
a greenhouse effect more significant than CO2.1,2 Combustion control and flue gas treatment techniques have both been
previously examined for their potential as a means of controlling
the emission of NOx. They are relatively
low-cost approaches, which abate emissions at source, consequently
requiring minimal investment for process modification. However, their
removal efficiency is modest and unable to meet increasingly stringent
emission targets.3 Flue gas treatment has
been explored via several methods, the most promising of which is
catalytic NO reduction.4−6 The NH3-selective catalytic reduction
(NH3-SCR) process is commonly associated with stationary
emission sources, such as coal-fired power plants and oil refineries.3,4 The V2O5-WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 catalyst exhibits excellent activity and N2 selectivity
between 300 and 450 °C under typical commercial conditions. This
temperature is consistent with that found before electrostatic precipitator
and desulfurization units, which means that the catalyst is utilized
in the presence of significant dust and SO2 concentrations.3,4,7 To avoid such harsh operating
conditions, the process could be located after the aforementioned
devices at an operating temperature of 250 °C or lower. However,
this concept requires the development of catalysts that are able to
operate efficiently at the conditions detailed above.8,9

Single-metal oxides have been explored for their potential
in low-temperature
NH3-SCR processes, of which manganese oxides (MnOx) are known to be one of the most promising.10,11 The combination of Mn with secondary transition-metal ions has led
to the development of many active mixed-metal oxides, particularly,
Ce–Mn,12−14 Fe–Mn,15−17 and Cr–Mn18,19 combinations. In each case, significant NOx conversions were obtained, but these values are attributable
to the total surface reaction rate of the catalyst. Clearly, changes
in surface area, activity, or their combination can influence conversion.
As such, improvement of one property may offset a decline in the other,
an effect that appears to be evident in previously reported Cr–Mn
combinations.18,19 To confirm this possibility,
areal activity is used to remove bias introduced by surface area from
weighted activity (nmol s–1 g–1).20 Values of 2.2 and 5.2 nmol s–1 m–2 were obtained for Cr(0.4)–MnOx and MnOx, respectively.18 Clearly, the addition of Cr to MnOx inhibits the latter, indicating that improved conversion
is obtained as a consequence of surface area enhancement. This also
appears to be consistent with Cr–Mn materials prepared by Qiu
et al. and Gao et al. (0.5 and 2.5 nmol s–1 m–2, respectively).19,21 Chen et al.
and Gao et al. produced materials possessing similar surface reaction
rates, but different structures;18,21 in both cases,
the citric acid method was employed, which could imply that the synthetic
approach directly influences the generation of active sites. As such,
modification of the annealing parameters may lead to improvement in
areal activity while generating a range of Cr-Mn catalysts with varied
physiochemical properties.Such an apporach has been shown to readily
modify both catalytic and material-type properties in other related
systems.22,23 Mahnaz et al. reported that calcination
temperature has a substantial impact on the primary manganese oxide
phase formed over functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes. While
higher temperatures notably increased the MnO fraction, longer hold
time at 300 °C decreased the concentration of residual Mn(NO3)2.22 Bin et al. prepared
Ti–Ce–V oxide catalysts at low and high annealing temperatures,
with the former exhibiting significantly better chemisorption properties.24 Xu and co-workers reported that calcination
had a significant effect on the catalytic activity of Ce–Zr
composites, materials prepared at 500 °C possessed optimized
Lewis acidity, active oxygen concentration, redox properties, and
activity.25 Meng et al. prepared a series
of Sm–Mn mixed oxides between 350 and 650 °C, yielding
materials ranging from amorphous to crystalline. The former exhibited
significantly higher surface area, surface Mn(IV) species, adsorbed
oxygen, and NOx conversion.26 Hence, annealing strategies obviously affect
the physiochemical and textural properties of a variety of materials,
producing myriad effects.

Herein, a series of Cr–Mn mixed
oxides were prepared using
a variable annealing strategy to adjust the physiochemical, textural,
and catalytic properties. Characterization techniques reveal that
materials are highly amorphous, possessing textural properties intimately
linked to annealing temperature and time. Maximum activity window
is obtained when the precursor is treated at 300 °C for 10 h,
coinciding with the largest surface area, reducibility, total acidity,
and concentration of high valence states. Surface reaction rate of
the aforementioned catalyst is similar to those obtained for materials
prepared at 400 °C, while annealing for 1 or 5 h at 300 °C
exhibits about 2–3 times larger value. A near-linear correlation
is obtained for areal activity and acid site density, demonstrating
the limiting nature of the latter for Cr–Mn mixed oxides prepared
via the citric acid method.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of CrMnOx
Chromium(III)
nitrate nonahydrate (0.050 mol) and
manganese(II) acetate tetrahydrate (0.075 mol) were added to a citric
acid solution (250 mL, with an equal metal ion-to-citric acid molar
ratio) and stirred vigorously for 1 h. The solution was then removed
and placed in a drying oven set at 120 °C for 12–14 h,
producing a porous citrate precursor, which was ground to a coarse
powder. To remove issues associated with random variation between
batches, materials were homogenized in an in-house fabricated cylindrical
mixing device. The precursor (15.00 g) was split evenly into two heavy-duty
α-alumina crucibles without lids, placed into a muffle furnace,
heated to the desired temperature at 2 °C min–1, and held for a specified time. Upon cooling, the crucibles were
removed from the furnace and the as-obtained powders were mixed. For
the purposes of reaction testing, the catalysts were ground to a fine
powder, pressed to 98 000 kN between 13 mm die, and then sieved
to 60–80 mesh. Catalysts prepared at 300 and 400 °C are
labeled as a and b, where a is the annealing temperature in °C
and b is the hold time in h. Materials prepared at 450 and 650 °C
are denoted by the final annealing temperature and time only; however,
both were pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h to control the combustion
process. Single oxides are denoted as Cr-300 and Mn-300, corresponding
to their element and preparation temperature (°C); in both cases,
hold time (1 h) was omitted for brevity.

2.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were collected on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker,
Germany) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation from
5 to 80o at 0.04o s–1. Raman
spectroscopy was carried out using a catalyst powder on a LabRAM Aramis
(HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France) with a 532 laser (λ = 532 nm) and
an electrically cooled CCD detector. In all tests, the microscope
magnification was set at 50× with a resolution of 1 px–1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed on
a Tensor 27 (Bruker, Germany) with a DLaTGS detector and a He-Ne laser.
The background was obtained by scanning dried KBr powder, and the
results are the average of 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and are background-corrected. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were conducted
in an Su8220 microscope (Hitachi, Japan), employing a cold field emission
electron gun. Images were recorded via the upper detector for secondary
electrons at an accelerating voltage of 10.0 kV and 5000–80 000
times magnification. The catalyst powder was placed onto the conductive
adhesive and tested without sputtering. N2 sorption isotherms
were obtained on a Tristar II 3020 (Micromeritics), and surface area
was calculated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation.
About 100 mg of 60–80 mesh catalyst was pretreated at 150 °C
under vacuum (50–100 mTorr) for 5 h to remove moisture and
adsorbed gases. In all cases, the materials were tested multiple times
and the reported values are the average. CHN elemental analysis was
conducted on a Vario EL cube (Elementar, Germany) by heating preweighed
powder samples (6.5 ± 0.2 mg) in the presence of O2 to 1150 °C. A TCD was used for the quantification of CO/CO2, H2O, NOx, and N2O, which are back-calculated to yield weighted values. Reported
numbers are the average of two to three replicants, which are required
to average out any sample heterogeneity. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed on a TG 209 F3 Tarsus (Netzsch, Germany). Experiments
were conducted between 50 and 650 °C at 5 °C min–1 with 6–7 mg of citrate precursor and a gas mixture composed
of 20 mL min–1 air and 20 mL min–1 N2. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on an AutoChem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer
(Micromeritics). A 60–80 mesh catalyst (50 mg (±2 mg))
was pretreated in He (30 mL min–1) at 200 °C
for 1 h. After cooling to 50 °C, 10% H2–Ar
was introduced over the catalyst (30 mL min–1) for
2 h to ensure that the results were not affected by H2 adsorption
at low temperature. Reduction was then conducted from 50 to 550 °C
under the same H2 flow at 10 °C min–1. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was undertaken on a TP 5080 (Xianquan, China). Approximately
100 mg of catalyst powder was pretreated at 200 °C for 1 h in
N2 (30 mL min–1) and cooled to 30 °C.
10% NH3 in N2 was passed over the clean catalyst
surface at 30 mL min–1 until complete surface saturation
was achieved (1 h was found to be optimal). The NH3-adsorbed
catalyst was conditioned at 70 °C in N2 (30 mL min–1) to remove physisorbed species before heating at
10 °C min–1 to 800 °C. An independent
series of background experiments were conducted with a representative
fraction of each catalyst, the purpose of which was to ensure that
any thermally induced phase transitions could be reliably removed
from the data. In situ DRIFTS was performed on a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer
(Bruker, Germany) equipped with a smart controller, a liquid N2-cooled MCT/A, and a Pike programmable temperature controller.
Materials were pretreated at 200 °C for 1 h in N2,
followed by exposure of the catalyst surface to 0.1% NH3 in N2 for 0.5 h at 100 °C. At all stages of the
experiment, the flow rate was maintained at 100 mL min–1. The results were recorded after subtracting the background spectrum
at reaction temperature and are an average of 64 scans obtained with
a resolution of 4 cm–1. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was performed on an OPTIMA 8000 (PerkinElmer).
Test solutions were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of sample, yielding
a stock solution of approximately 1000 mg L–1, which
is further diluted to 10 mg L–1. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an ESCALAB 250 Xi (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) with Al Kα (E = 1486.6 eV) as the
X-ray source. Initial survey scans have been conducted at a constant
pass energy of 100.0 eV with a step size of 1.00 eV, while high-resolution
scans were performed at 20.0 and 0.05 eV, respectively. Cr and Mn
deconvolution were conducted by following reported methods, which
were designed to model the complex peak shape of metal oxides.27,28

2.3 Catalytic Evaluation
The resulting
materials were probed for their activity in the low-temperature NH3-SCR process in a fixed-bed reactor near atmospheric pressure
under the following conditions: 0.1% NO, 0.1% NH3, 3.0%
O2, and N2 balance. Approximately 1.50 g of
catalyst was used for each test, with an ambient flow rate of 1000
mL min–1 generating a GHSV of approximately 50 000
h–1. The propensity of Mn-based NH3-SCR
catalysts as adsorbents at low temperatures is well known;12,18 therefore, materials were equilibrated in the presence of the gas
mixture at approximately 50 °C for 1 h prior to heating the reactor.
Experiments were conducted from 80 to 240 °C at 20 °C increments
with a ramp rate of 2 °C min–1 via temperature
control. The total NOx concentration was
continuously monitored by an Ecom EN2 gas analyzer; however, reported
results were obtained at or near steady state. Two key parameters
were used to assess the activity of these systems, NOx conversion and areal activity: 1   2  where CNOx is
the conversion of NOx, [NOx] is the total concentration NO and NO2, and [NOx]in and [NOx]out were determined by measuring
NOx via bypass and reactor lines, respectively.
Areal activity is expressed in nmol m–2 s–1, Qν NO is the molar flow rate of NO in nmol
s–1, NOx conversion
at 100 °C is a dimensionless fraction, SSA is the specific surface
area in m2 g–1 of the specified catalyst,
and mcat is the weight used for the reaction
in g.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization
XRD patterns were
recorded for mixed Cr–Mn oxides prepared at temperatures ranging
from 300 to 650 °C and single Cr/Mn oxides prepared at 300 °C
(Figure 1). Cr-300
and Mn-300 exhibit patterns typical of cubic α-Cr2O3 and tetragonal Mn3O4, respectively.18,21,29,30 The former phase is relatively well crystallized, as indicated by
the significant line intensity of the diffraction peaks near 25°
and between 34 and 36° 2θ. 650-1 gives rise to a single
well-defined phase that is consistent with CrMn1.5O4.18,31 The calculated cell parameter (a = 0.8475 nm) coincides very closely with that obtained by Priebe
et al. (a = 0.8479 nm),31 suggesting a high degree of similarity between the two materials.
The cell parameter for 450-1 (a = 0.8463 nm) is notably
smaller than that above, while the obtained XRD pattern also exhibits
α-Cr2O3 (Figure 1). Clearly, the expected CrMn1.5O4 phase is not fully formed at this lower temperature,
instead it appears consistent with an as-yet undefined mixed-spinel
phase. Materials synthesized at 400 °C produce very broad diffraction
lines in a similar region to the spinels, which are consistent with
crystallite sizes of 2.5–4.0 nm according to the Scherrer equation.
Longer hold time facilitates the formation of α-Cr2O3, but this is a relatively minor crystalline phase.
Preparation at 300 °C yields only a series of low-intensity lines
regardless of hold time, indicating the highly amorphous nature of
these materials.

(g) 650-1; (h) Mn-300; (i) Cr-300.

Spectroscopic analysis (Figure 2) verifies that Mn-300 is composed of only
the Mn3O4 phase identified by XRD. Curiously
Cr-300 produces
features consistent with both Cr2O3 and CrOOH,32 which suggests that the latter is present as
a highly amorphous phase. Group theory predicts five Raman-active
phonon modes (1A1g, 1Eg, and 3F2g) for the well-defined cubic spinel
present for 650-1. However, the obtained spectrum (Figure 2A) is far more convoluted than
that previously found for materials of the same symmetry, such as
CoCr2O4.33,34 Priebe et al. proposed
that CrMn1.5O4 takes on the following configuration:
Cr(IV)Mn(II)Mn(IV)0.5O4,31 where Cr(IV) occupies tetrahedral positions and Mn(II)/(IV)
fill 1.5 octahedral sites. This structure possesses charge-neutral
defects, which lower space group symmetry and adjust the number of
Raman-excited phonons.35 The FTIR spectrum
(Figure 2B) reveals
only two obvious signals, ca. 495 and 610 cm–1,
which correspond to two of the four expected F1u modes
predicted by group theory. Those positions are identical to the ones
obtained for Mn3O4, an observation pointing
toward similar contributions from oxygen in both structures. However,
the tetragonal spinel produces another F1u feature in the
mid-IR range (∼410 cm–1) that is associated
with Mn3+ in the octahedral hole. This is lacking from
spectra obtained for the cubic structure, suggesting that different
species occupy the six-coordinate position. The sample prepared at
450 °C possesses similar spectra to 650-1, albeit shifted toward
lower frequency. The only exception is the presence of FTIR features
above 800 cm–1 that are consistent with higher-oxidation-state
Cr species.36,37 Raman and FTIR spectra obtained
for materials prepared at 300 and 400 °C are largely similar,
while being significantly different from those described above. The
relative line broadness suggests that these materials generally possess
very low symmetry, while the FTIR spectrum of 400-10 (Figure 2B) reveals two additional bands
around 415 and 440 cm–1, which match modes associated
with crystalline Cr2O3. Furthermore, a number
of peaks evident in both Raman and FTIR spectra demonstrate that higher-valence
Cr species are present in all amorphous systems. Spectroscopic investigations
demonstrate clearly that materials prepared at 300 and 400 °C
are highly similar, while crystalline phases evident for the latter
are only minor components.

SEM images were obtained to examine the microstructure
of amorphous
Cr–Mn mixed-oxide catalysts (Figure 3). At 5000× magnification (inset of Figure 3), materials exhibit
no distinct microscale morphology and possess very rough surfaces
in all instances. Images obtained at higher magnification (80 000×)
show that the bulk grains are composed of irregular-shaped particles
of variable agglomeration degree. A similar observation reported by
Deorsola et al.38 suggests that significant
aggregation may be a trait of combustion-based synthetic processes.
Furthermore, the variable size of the grain in each amorphous system
makes it difficult to discern a clear correlation between annealing
parameters and particle size. Instead surface area measurements are
required to better understand the evolution of particles from the
perspective of its textural properties. At 300 °C, a clear improvement
in surface area is found between 1 and 10 h (31 and 116 m2 g–1, respectively), while minor variation is evident
from 1 to 5 h (Table 1). Elemental analysis proves that materials prepared at 5 and 10
h are largely devoid of carbon (Table 2), while 300-1 contains 0.37 wt %. The presence of
this residue suggests that a fraction of the citrate precursor, or
one of its decomposition products remain on the catalyst.

TGA was
conducted on the mixed-metal citrate precursor in the presence
of air between 50 and 650 °C (Figure 4). Below 150 °C, a modest and slow decline
(5.0 wt %) indicates the removal of physisorbed water.39 The two-stage process between 150 and 350 °C
is a complex region, where the 47.0 wt % mass loss coincides with
at least two processes: decomposition of hydrated nitrates and combustion
of citric acid and its derivatives.40 A
small feature is also evident above 425 °C, accounting for approximately
2.5 wt % of the sample. The nature of this feature is highly subjective,
but is not consistent with the removal of trace carbon from materials
after treatment at 400 °C (Table 2). Interestingly the aforementioned mass loss occurs
within the same thermal range as the transition from amorphous to
crystalline (400-1 and 450-1, respectively), ergo a connection between
the two processes is implied. Under temperature-controlled conditions,
it is clear that complete citrate removal is not achieved at 300 °C;
however, this does not fully replicate synthetic conditions. Experiments
conducted with well-established hold times (Figure 4) demonstrate that a small residual mass
remains after treatment for 60 min. Interestingly, only 90 min were
required to reach a final mass consistent with that obtained before
425 °C. Therefore, the finite combustion time scale ensures that
particles prepared at 300 °C for 5 and 10 h evolve as a consequence
of annealing conditions and not due to secondary effects. Materials
prepared at 400 °C avoid the uncertainties of incomplete combustion
(Figure 4 and Table 2). As such, the observed
surface area decline from 93 to 77 m2 g–1 between 1 and 10 h, respectively, is wholly associated with thermally
induced transformation. Interestingly, 450-1 exhibits a similar value
(73 m2 g–1) to that obtained for 400-10,
implying that variations of temperature and hold time can yield similar
textural properties. Obviously, this does not extend to the formation/crystallization
of the CrMnOx spinel structure, which
appears to be thermally dependent.

°C min–1; the nomenclature denotes initial
temperature, final temperature (°C), and hold time (min).

ICP-AES and EDX analyses (Table 2) reveal that the
Cr ratios obtained for all amorphous
materials are very close to those anticipated from the experimental
design (0.40). Obviously, if any losses are evident during the synthetic
approach, then they do not favor one element over another, allowing
for the observed consistency. Strictly speaking, ICP is more representative
of the bulk due to the significantly larger quantity of material analyzed
by the technique. Thus, it is not surprising that EDX, an approach
that analyzes individual micron-sized particles, yields slightly greater
deviation (0.39–0.42 vs 0.39–0.40). Elemental mapping
(Figure 5) reveals
that the materials do not possess regions that are highly concentrated
in only one element. In all examples, Mn and Cr components are highly
dispersed throughout the particle on the microscale. As such, the
catalysts are believed to take the form of an amorphous mixed-oxide
structure, one that appears to be different from other reported Cr–Mn
combinations.18,19,21

(a) 300-1; (b) 300-5; (c) 300-10; (d) 400-1; (e) 400-10.

Surface composition (Table 2) indicates that all materials, except 400-10,
are somewhat
enriched with Cr compared to the bulk (0.43–0.45 vs 0.40).
High-resolution Mn 2p spectra (Figure 6A) show the presence of two distinct signals at 653.8
± 0.1 (2p1/2) and 642.2 ± 0.1 (2p3/2). The obtained energy separation, 11.6 eV, is consistent with values
previously reported for mixed manganese oxides.27,28 To rationalize the nature of the Mn component, peak fitting deconvolution
was conducted for both Mn signals.28 Three
dominant valence states emerge, coinciding with variable proportions
of Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV). In general, all systems possess a
significant quantity of Mn(III), while modest values of the other
two species are found (Table 3). A clear trend emerges with annealing time at 300 °C,
where the concentrations of Mn(II) and Mn(III) decrease and the Mn(IV)
fraction increases. Comparative examination of 300-1 and 400-1 demonstrates
that higher temperature increases both Mn(II) and Mn(IV) surface concentrations.
Two obvious peaks are observed in the high-resolution Cr 2p spectra
(Figure 6B) at around
586.3 ± 0.1 and 576.8 ± 0.1 eV, typical of the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 signals, respectively. Following the deconvolution
protocols reported by Biesinger et al.,27 three distinct environments are evident, with two readily identified
as Cr2O3 and Cr(VI).41 The other exhibits a similar peak splitting pattern to the Cr(III)
species, albeit shifted toward higher binding energy. From the trends
observed for MnOOH and Mn2O3,27 we suggest that this additional feature may be consistent
with Cr(III) ions in a CrOOH-type environment. The small energy separation
between Cr(III) species does not allow for a definitive quantification
of the two individual components; hence, their total is denoted as
Cr(III) in Table 3.
Three distinct oxygen species are apparent in the obtained O 1s spectra
(Figure 6C), coinciding
with adsorbed water (Oγ), active oxygen (Oα), and lattice oxygen species (Oβ).18,42 The former is quite consistent between surfaces (Table 3), while the relative concentration
of lattice oxygen is larger for 300–600, 400–60, and
400–600, implying that lower temperature and hold time is beneficial
for the retention of more coordinatively unsaturated cationic species.
Typically, active oxygen exists as a variety of functionalities, particularly,
hydroxyls, adsorbed O– and O22–. In all cases, there is some precedent of their benefitting the
low-temperature NH3-SCR process.20,43,44 The dominance of Cr(III) species in Cr-containing
catalysts is not a particularly surprising result,41 but the large surface concentration of Mn(III) is in stark
contrast to a number of other studies.38,44 However, the
use of a more advanced modeling technique may more accurately reflect
the surface composition than single-peak models.27,28 For example, Kang et al. found large concentrations of bulk Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 species (−80.0%)
for materials prepared at 350 and 450 °C. However, the surface
Mn(IV) concentration was determined to be approximately 50% from a
single-peak fitting model.45 It is also
well documented that aqueous Mn(IV) ions readily oxidize Cr(III) even
under ambient conditions.46,47 In these cases, there
has been no evidence of charge carriers, implying that direct interaction
between the two is required for the reaction to proceed. However,
the degrees of freedom are significantly constrained in the solid-state
compared to those above. Thus, the formation of undefined Cr–O–Mn
bonding is likely required to meet the definition of direct interaction
in solids. Previous observations over well-defined mixed-spinel structures
have suggested that Cr(VI) preferentially forms at the surface of
the catalyst.48,49 Therefore, Mn species meeting
the bonding requirement within surface/subsurface layers may preferentially
undergo reduction. Interestingly, the trends observed for Cr(VI) and
Mn(IV) imply that annealing time does not significantly influence
the proposed synergetic transition. Instead, the formation of Mn(III)
could arise during the combustion process, which drives the initial
formation and equilibration of transition-metal valence states.

H2-TPR profiles reveal the presence of two reduction
signals for all materials within the explored range (Figure 7). The first maxima are observed
at around 275 ± 7 °C, while the second are obtained as shoulders
at 365 ± 10 °C. However, there are deviations in total intensity
(Figure 7) and the
relative ratio between low- and high-temperature signals (Table 1). Tang et al. demonstrated
that well-defined α-Mn2O3 exhibits two
signals at approximately 350 and 450 °C. Their total area ratio
is approximately 1–2 coinciding with the sequential reduction
of Mn2O3 to MnO via the intermediate spinel
phase.50 β-MnO2 also exhibits
two peaks that are shifted toward lower temperature (310 and 410 °C),
indicating improved reducibility of the Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 intermediates.51 The reduction positions observed for the Cr–Mn combinations
(Figure 7) more closely
resemble those of MnO2, albeit at lower temperature. Also,
the intensity ratios obtained between low- and high-temperature peaks
(Table 1) are very
different from those reported for either manganese compounds.50,51 There are two key differences that could contribute to the extent
of the aforementioned ratio: the amorphous nature of the mixed material
and the presence of high-oxidation-state Cr species. In the case of
the former, it is plausible that negligible long-range ordering promotes
a reduction of the M–O bond energy, an effect typically observed
for smaller crystallites.52 Furthermore,
the energetic distinction between surface and bulk M–O bonds
should become less defined in smaller domains. While these arguments
are qualitatively valid, they are unable to rationalize significant
variations found for materials prepared at 300 and 400 °C. Therefore,
Cr species must contribute to the obtained TPR profiles, while being
susceptible to modification during the synthetic process.

100 and 500 °C: (a) 300-1; (b) 300-5; (c) 300-10; (d) 400-1;
(e) 400-10.

The feature observed
at 275 °C lies within the range commonly
considered for the reduction of Cr species,18,19,21,53,54 but definitive assignment is difficult. For Cr–Mn
combinations, transitions in this range have been assigned to the
reduction of Cr2O3 to CrO.18,19,21 However, no empirical evidence has been
provided to support the validity of this assignment. Other authors
have suggested that Cr(III) reduces only at high temperature, while
attributing the reduction of Cr(VI) to features ca. 250 °C.48,49,53,54 The Cr–Mn mixed-oxide catalysts clearly contain appreciable
quantities of higher-oxidation-state Cr species. It is likely that
the 275 °C peak is a combinative reduction feature, consistent
with both higher-oxidation-state Mn and Cr components. The relevance
of Cr(VI) species in NH3-SCR appears to be highly dependent
on the catalyst type and whether or not it is supported. For instance,
Engweiler et al. reported that NH3 reacts with Cr(VI) to
form a stable [Cr(I)–NO]2+ complex over TiO2-supported CrOx.55 While, Sloczynski has shown that coupling Cr(VI) with another
redox-active metal can promote the conversion of NOx.48 Of these two examples, our amorphous
catalysts more closely resemble the latter, implying that Cr(VI) species
may play an active role in SCR catalysis. Several studies have demonstrated
that increased NH3-SCR activity typically correlates with
improved reduction characteristics.18,44,56 In most cases, this is demonstrated by the shift
of reduction maxima toward lower temperature, but there is little
variation for our systems. However, changes in the total H2 consumption (Table 1) indicate semiquantitative variation in the total number of reducible
species. A monotonous increase in the aforementioned value is realized
for materials prepared at 300 °C with increasing annealing time,
which demonstrates that the number and/or valence state of cationic
species increases with longer exposure to oxygen. Interestingly, this
trend is not reflected at 400 °C, instead a significant decline
of the low-temperature peak is evident, indicating thermal sensitivity
of higher-valence Cr species.49

Acidity
is also considered to be an important factor in the NH3-SCR process, although it is often perceived as more relevant
at higher temperature.56 It is important
to recall that NH3-TPD profiles do not just relate to “acidity”;
in several cases Lewis acid sites are reducible surface species. Regardless,
the specificity of this technique makes it most suited to probe the
number of catalytically relevant sites. All amorphous materials exhibit
largely similar profile shapes (Figure 7) with minimal variation in peak position, α:
330–345 °C, β: 435–450 °C, σ:
470–485 °C, and γ: 560–570 °C. Even
with this similarity, the relative acidity changes significantly (Table 1), accurately mirroring
the qualitative trend observed in the H2-TPR profiles.
These absolute trends reveal that 300-10 exhibits the largest number
of acid sites, but each material possesses a significantly different
surface area. Thus, shorter annealing time and lower temperature are
more beneficial for maintaining acid site density, while 300-10, 400-1,
and 400-10 all possess statistically similar values (Table 1). As such, the decrease in
acidity at 400 °C can be rationalized as a simple decline in
surface area, but it remains unclear why 300-10 cannot support higher
site densities. To further probe the nature of adsorbed NHx species, a series of in situ DRIFTS experiments
were conducted (Figure 5). NH3 adsorption over 300-1 generates a relatively simple
DRIFT spectrum between 800 and 1750 cm–1 at 100
°C (Figure 8).
Weakly coordinated NH3 is observed between 960 and 990
cm–1.13 Lewis acid-bound
NH3 is found at ca. 1220 and 1602 cm–1. NH4+ formed on Brønsted acid sites occurs
at 1445 and 1680 cm–1 (symmetric and asymmetric
bending modes, respectively).57,58 Upon adsorption of
NH3, a new acidic O–H stretching mode is formed
(3630 cm–1),59 implying
that the former dissociates over strong Lewis acid sites. Curiously,
no corresponding amide rocking feature is found,60 suggesting that either the catalyst dissociates NH3 multiple times or the signal has shifted position. The NH3 Lewis acid site signal lowers in intensity and broadens for
300-5, demonstrating a change in the fundamental nature of the bending
mode. Coupled to this is the presence of signal splitting in the N–H
stretching region (2600–3400 cm–1), consistent
with change in the symmetry of the adsorbed NHx. Furthermore, for 400-1, the effects discussed above are exacerbated,
implying a greater change in the nature of adsorbed species. The lowering
of both vibrational and bending modes, in addition to a smaller acidic
O–H signal, indicates that the bonding between NH3 and Lewis acid sites becomes weaker. Consequently, the extent of
NH3 dissociation is lowered, generating more labile NHx species and improving the reversible adsorption
properties for 300-5. However, higher preparation temperature clearly
modifies the surface to a great extent, producing fewer acid sites
of more varied nature (Figure 9).

(e) 400-10.

3.2 Catalytic Performance
Amorphous and
crystalline Cr–Mn mixed-oxide catalysts were explored for their
activity in the NH3-SCR process with excess O2 (Figure 10). It
is apparent that the amorphous systems exhibit much larger conversion
than either crystalline materials at temperatures less than 160 °C.
Of all those tested, 300-10 produces the widest activity window and
lowest T60 value (Figure 10 and Table 1). Characterization results demonstrate that this catalyst
possesses the largest surface area, total reducibility, and acidity,
which match characteristics reported to be beneficial for the low-temperature
NH3-SCR reaction.18,19,21,22,24−26 One of the major drawbacks of the Cr–Mn combination
appears to be inherently low surface reaction rates (areal activity).18,19,21,48 The “so-called” best-performing material in this study
exhibits a value of approximately 3.8 nmol s–1 m–2, which is comparable to that obtained for materials
synthesized at 400 °C (Table 1). This is somewhat higher than combinations reported
by Chen et al., Qiu et al. (Table 1), and Sloczynski et al. (1.5 nmol s–1 m–2) at 100 °C.48 However, 300-5, with significantly lower surface area (averaging
37 m2 g–1), possesses reaction-based
metrics comparable to 300-10. Consequently, its areal activity is
much higher, 11.5 nmol s–1 m–2, signficantly improving upon previously reported values for Cr–Mn
combinations.18,19,21,48

Figure 10 NOx conversion of CrMnOx catalysts between
80 and 240 °C, where the dotted lines indicate 60 and 80% NOx conversion.

Through the design of a systematic annealing strategy, a
series
of Cr–Mn catalysts possessing a range of physiochemical properties
have been developed. To understand the fundamental nature of the observed
enhancement effect, variations in reducibility,44,51 Oα surface concentration,20,43,44 and acidity19,44,56 were considered alongside areal activity values.
There are numerous examples showing that materials exhibiting improved
SCR performance often possess enhanced redox properties.18,44,56 However, the minor variations
observed for the amorphous materials do not give rise to a convincing
correlation with areal activity (Figure 11A). This is further extended to H2 consumption, which exhibits significant variation at nearly constant
activity (Table 1).
For the purposes of the NH3-SCR reaction, the amorphous
catalysts do not appear to be limited by their reduction properties.
XPS-observed Oα species are often associated with
activated oxygen, which can facilitate the formation of NO2, an important intermediate for the fast-SCR process.61,62 Much like reducibility, this trend also exhibits a volcano plot
(Figure 11B). Although
there is some sense to the trend, where higher Oα concentration is observed for 300-1 and 300-5, its relevance is
doubtful due to the effective concentration once surface area is considered.
The signal attributed to Oα corresponds to several
different species, such as active oxygen and hydroxyl groups. The
latter is more prevalent in 300-1 and 300-5 compared to 400-1 according
to in situ DRIFTS. NH4+ is an important species
for the generation of NH4NO2, an intermediate
associated with fast-SCR.19 However, reducible
Lewis acid sites dissociate NH3 to NH2, facilitating
the formation of NH2NO, an important species for normal
SCR.21 As such, the combinative influence
of both sites cannot be overlooked. Correlation of acid site density
with areal activity at 100 °C yields an almost linear trend (Figure 11C), and materials
with similar surface reaction rates are convincingly rationalized.
Obviously, this indicates that activity enhancement occurs due to
an increase in the concentration of active sites and not from enhanced
site-specific turnover. Therefore, the limiting parameter for amorphous
Cr–Mn mixed oxides prepared via the citric acid method is associated
with the density of surface acid sites. However, the contribution
and requirement of each type remains uncertain, requiring further
study to explore the mechanistic aspects of these active systems.

4 Conclusions
A simple
and low-cost annealing approach has been explored to improve
the catalytic efficiency of CrMnOx mixed
oxides for low-temperature NH3-SCR. Characterization techniques
show that all materials possess complex amorphous structures with
minor crystalline phases evident at higher temperature. 300-10 possesses
the largest surface area, reducibility, acidity, and number of high
valence species, culminating in the highest NOx conversion at 100 °C. Annealing at 300 °C for 1
or 5 h facilitates the formation of materials with significantly larger
areal activities, which is observed to be largely consistent with
acid site density. 300-5, the largest surface reaction rate obtained
in this study (11.5 nmol s–1 m–2), compares favorably to previously reported Cr–Mn combinations,
affording a 5- to 23-fold increase, making this the most active CrMnOx catalyst to date. Additional investigations
are currently ongoing to determine their activity under typical flue
gas conditions, while also attempting to understand the importance
of acid site nature on overall surface activity.
