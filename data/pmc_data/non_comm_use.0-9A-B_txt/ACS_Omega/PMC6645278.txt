Here,
we report the synthesis of vanadium diselenide (VSe2) three-dimensional
nanoparticles (NPs) and two-dimensional (2D)
nanosheets (NSs) utilizing nanosecond pulsed laser ablation technique
followed by liquid-phase exfoliation. Furthermore, a systematic study
has been conducted on the effect of NP and NS morphologies of VSe2 in their catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) under alkaline, neutral, and acidic conditions. Research on
VSe2 clearly demonstrates that these morphologies do not
have a significant difference for ORR and OER; however, a drastic
effect of morphology was observed for HER. The ORR activity of both
NSs and NPs involves ∼2.85 numbers of electrons with the Tafel
slope of 120 mV/dec in alkaline and neutral pH. In alkaline solution,
NPs are proved to be an efficient catalyst for OER with an onset potential
1.5 V; however, for HER, NSs have a better onset potential of −0.25
V. Moreover, the obtained NPs have also better catalytic activity
with a 400 mV anodic shift in the onset potential compared to NSs.
These results provide a reference point for the future application
of VSe2 in energy storage and conversion devices and mass
production of other 2D materials.

Introduction
Ultrathin transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the general
formula MX2, where M is a transition-metal element (M =
Ti, V, Ta, Mo, Re, W) and X is a chalcogen atom (X = S, Se, Te). TMDs
are one of the most promising two-dimensional (2D) layered materials1−3 as next-generation atomically thin devices and have recently become
popular due to their unique properties that do not exist in their
bulk counterparts.4,5 MX2 crystal structure
is based on strongly covalent (intralayer) X–M–X bonds
within each layer and weak van der Waals (interlayer) X···X
interactions between layers.6 In recent
years, broad attention has been paid to employ different types of
materials and strategies for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)7,8 and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).9−11 The use of 2D transition-metal
compounds in HER12−14 and OER8,15 applications has been
the subject of many of these studies in recent years. Among all of
these 2D TMDs, their semiconducting subsets, where the transition
metal is typically Mo or W and the chalcogen atom is made of S or
Se, have been the subject of growing attention due to their promising
electrical, optoelectrical, and electrochemical characteristics.16−18

One of the most frequently employed materials for this application
is molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). It has been found that
high catalytic activity of MoS2 is mainly originated from
the high concentration of active sites, which are S sites in this
case.18−24 The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of this material
is found to be linearly correlated with the concentration of these
sites.19 Moreover, it is theoretically
demonstrated that the activity of inert basal planes in MoS2 can be improved by adding different metal atoms, such as Pt, Co,
and Ni dopants.2,25−27 A lot of experimental
efforts have been devoted to increase the catalytic performance of
the material. The introduction of high concentration of defect sites
through the synthesis is one of these approaches. As already mentioned,
doping with metal atoms can also enhance the HER activity of the TMD
material. Phase transition from semiconductor 2H to metal 1T-MoS2 was also found as an efficient approach to improve the HER
activity.28−30 The high electrical conductivity originated from
metallic behavior in 1T-MoS2 and 1T-WS2 layers
is supposed to be responsible for its high catalytic activity. However,
these 1T products are thermodynamically unfavorable and complicated
chemical treatments are required for their synthesis. Unlike these
inherently semiconducting group of TMDs that are made of group-six
transition metals, group-five TMDs (where the transition metal is
V, Nb, and Ta and the chalcogen is S, Se, and Te) are purely metal
and can provide higher electron conductivity.31−33 Moreover, a
high HER activity originating from the high activity of both basal
plane and edge sites, having H adsorption free energy approximating
to optimal (ΔGH = 0 eV), has been
predicted by the density functional theory for this type of TMDs.34 In one of the first works, a superior catalytic
performance was recorded for single-crystal 1T-VS2 nanosheets
(NSs). The authors demonstrated that this layered TMD design can provide
an extremely low overpotential of −68 meV at 10 mA/cm2, small Tafel slopes (∼34 mV/dec), and high stability demonstrating
its potential as a candidate non-noble metal catalyst for HER.35 Later, a comprehensive study36 was conducted on the catalytic performance of nine different
group-five TMDs, and the findings proved that VTe2 can
have even higher activity compared to VS2. VTe2 manifests the lowest HER overpotential at 0.5 V (vs reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE)) and Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec. This difference was
actually aroused from the morphology of the synthesized materials.
As revealed in a recent study,37 lithium-exfoliated
vanadium dichalcogenides (VS2, VSe2, VTe2) were found to have dramatically different properties from
their bulk counterparts. Although the HER catalytic performance of
the bulk materials is VTe2 > VSe2 > VS2, the trend for exfoliated materials is VS2 >
VSe2 > VTe2. These results together with
previous findings
suggest that as we move toward a single layer, the VS2 becomes
the most active catalyst and in the bulk phase (thicker nanosheets)
VTe2 is identified as the best-performing material.

Vanadium diselenide (VSe2) is another member of this
group of materials that has attracted a lot of attention as a potential
2D material for future energy storage, conversion, and sensor applications.
Besides its intercalation processes38−40 and highly unusual charge
density wave properties,41 VSe2 has been predicted to have strong potential to be used as a catalyst
or electrode material in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction,42 supercapacitors,43 photocatalytic reaction,44 and lithium-ion
and sodium-ion batteries.45−48 However, there have been few studies reported on
the electrochemical activities of layered VSe2.39,49 Recently, a colloidal synthesis route to obtain single-layer VSe2 nanosheet has been developed, which offers an excellent HER
activity with a low onset overpotential of 108 mV after oxygen plasma
exposure.49 A similar report revealed the
potential of VSe2 for high HER performance.50 Interestingly, a very recent study proves the
application of this material in photoelectrochemical application,
which was unexpected before, considering the fact that the VSe2 is a metallic material with no optical band gap.44 Essentially, production of monolayer/few-layered
typical 2D TMDs is mainly made possible through chemical vapor deposition
(CVD)51 or exfoliation from the bulk. Exfoliation
can be applied either in dry phase as a mechanical cleavage52−54 (the “scotch-tape” method) from bulk crystals or in
liquid phase via dispersion in a liquid, served with/without chemical
reactions.55 Although mechanical exfoliation
ensures high-quality and micrometer-sized flakes, it is not suitable
for large-scale production because the number of layers cannot be
controlled precisely.2 Chemical exfoliation
of TMDs, however, is a simple and versatile method to attain nanosheets
with high repeatability.56 This synthesis
mainly relies on the lithium-ion-assisted exfoliation and it involves
two main mechanisms: (1) permeation of the Li ions into the planar
area (intercalation) and (2) breakage of van der Waals bindings using
intercalated Li+ hosts (exfoliation). However, there is
still a synthetic challenge to synthesize vanadium diselenide (VSe2), which belongs to group-five layered dichalcogenides. Over
the past few decades, researchers could only realize VSe2 synthesis by chemical vapor transport,57−59 chemical vapor
deposition (CVD),51,60 and scotch-tape-based mechanical
exfoliation50 of the bulk VSe2 until Xu et al.39 have recently synthesized
it in an aqueous solution. Later, other researchers have also proposed
different chemical-based synthesis methods to make VSe2 nanosheets.49 However, due to the complex
chemical environment in solution, it is still challenging to prepare
contamination-free samples by a solution-based method.

In the
present work, we propose a top-down, large-scale compatible,
surfactant-free, and widely adopted approach for the synthesis of
VSe2 nanostructures (directly from bulk) by utilizing a
two-stage process. In the first stage, pulsed laser ablation (PLA)
technique with stationary beam scanning is applied on the bulk rock
to produce VSe2 nanoparticles (NPs). Following laser ablation,
ultrasonication-assisted lithium intercalation process is conducted
using lithium carbonate in colloidal solution of NPs to successfully
produce VSe2 nanosheets (NSs). During this process, ultrasonication
assists lithium ions to easily permeate into the VSe2 matrix
due to the weak van der Waals interaction between the stacked layers.
The experiments are conducted to scrutinize the structural and electrochemical
properties of the NP and NS structures. The electrocatalytic activities
of VSe2 NPs and NSs are compared to oxygen evolution reaction
(OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and HER in the alkaline, neutral,
and acidic media.

The practical advantage of using neutral solutions
is that it is
beneficial for the devices that are operated at a physiological pH,
i.e., biological and enzymatic fuel cells.61,62 For this aim, the catalytic behavior of VSe2 was evaluated
under neutral conditions as well. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report on the fabrication of VSe2 NPs and
NSs by employing laser ablation. Moreover, different from previous
studies that are mostly focused on HER performance of the VSe2, in this study, we have conducted a comprehensive research
on the OER and ORR activities of the prepared VSe2 nanostructures
as well.

Results and Discussion
The production of VSe2 NSs and NPs is schematically
depicted in Figure 1. As shown in this figure, first, VSe2 rock target was
ablated in deionized (DI) water to produce NPs with a broad size distribution.
To obtain these NPs, the stationary beam was employed for 200 cycles.
Afterward, LiCO3 powder was added as a lithium source to
this coral-colored solution and the solution was sonicated for 90
min to create NSs, where the solution turns to appear as a darkish
transparent solution.

Figure 1 Proposed mechanism for exfoliated VSe2 NS synthesis:
initially, stationary beam was applied to produce VSe2 NPs
and then sonication is applied by adding LiCO3, which results
in exfoliation of platelets of VSe2 NSs.

For the initial step, the structural properties
of the VSe2 nanostructures are investigated and shown in Figure 2a–e. The transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of resultant NPs and NSs confirm
that the obtained NPs by laser ablation are nearly three-dimensional
(3D) spherical with high size distribution ranging from tens to hundreds
of nanometers (as revealed in Figure 2a) and exfoliated layers have ultrathin 2D nature,
as clearly observed in Figure 2b. Further investigations using high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
images, shown in Figure 2c, prove that the fabricated NSs are single crystalline, displaying
(011) lattice sets with an interplanar spacing of 2.63 Ǻ.

ablation and (b) VSe2 NSs after exfoliation (inset shows
a magnified image of single NS); (c) HRTEM image of VSe2 indicating 2.6 Ǻ lattice fringes, with the inset (d)
showing the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern; and
(e) atomic force microscopy (AFM) topographic image of exfoliated
NS with depth profile.

The inset located in the same figure is selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from the NS nanostructure, and it
displays a typical layered material stacked up by a few/multiple ultrathin
sheets. From these images, one can easily understand that upon dropping
the VSe2 single-layer NSs on a substrate it shows an obvious
tendency to self-assemble and merge into large sheets. To be more
precise, the numbers of VSe2 layers are investigated by
atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. The AFM image (Figure 2e) depicts the general
observation on the exfoliated layered nature of the nanosheets and
the number of layers are studied by probing the thickness; the inset
shows a step profile, where the thickness of the layer increases from
∼0.3 nm (estimated thickness of the VSe2 monolayer)
to 2 nm.

For further investigations of NSs, powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD)
measurements are conducted to clarify the phase and the crystalline
structure of the obtained NSs. As shown in Figure S1, the structure shows a single-crystalline profile and a
hexagonal phase with a dominant diffraction peak of (011).47,63 On the other side, the lack of (001) main peak of VSe2 bulk can be stemmed from the laser ablation technique and we should
note that the (001) and (002) peak positions in VSe2 strongly
depend on the type of intercalant.64 Also,
X-ray diffraction spectrum infers that the impurities are due to the
presence of lithium carbonate and selenium product in the material.

To have an insight into the surface elemental composition, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are also carried out.
An almost same peak-fitting trend is observed for both samples. Figure 3a,b compares the
deconvolution spectra of V 2p for NS and NP morphologies. As shown
in Figure 3a, we have
two distinguished peaks located at 516.7.3 eV (V 2p3/2)
and 523.84 eV (V 2p1/2) for NP form of VSe2.
The peak at ∼517 eV indicates the presence of V4+ ions, which is +4 oxidation state of vanadium.65Figure 3b shows the doublets of Se 3d spectrum, Se 3d5/2 and Se
3d3/2 peaks located at ∼55.2 and ∼56.1 eV
with a spin–orbit splitting of 0.86 eV,66,67 as it is expected; however, both V 2p and Se 3d peaks have been
slightly shifted toward higher energies in the case of NSs related
to the well-known size reduction effect in metals.

and (b) Se 3d for VSe2 NPs, and (c) V 2p and (d) Se 3d

As previously discussed in Introduction, TMDs provide excellent catalysts for important reactions in energy
conversion and storage applications. However, to the best of our knowledge,
up to now, the electrochemistry and catalytic activity of NP and NS
morphologies of VSe2 have not been studied in detail. Therefore,
to understand the catalytic behavior at different pHs toward ORR,
OER, and HER, we conducted cylic voltammetry (CV)/linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) experiments in 0.1 M KOH, 0.5 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
(pH 7.0), and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions.

Oxygen Reduction
Reaction (ORR)
The ORR catalytic activities
of NSs and NPs were analyzed in O2-saturated alkaline (0.1
M KOH), neutral (0.5 M PBS, pH 7.0), and acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) solutions and normalized by N2-saturated
solutions shown in Figures S2–S4. Because NSs and NPs did not show any ORR catalytic activity in
H2SO4 (data not shown), ORR in alkaline and
neutral pHs is reported in this study. The possible reason for the
noncatalytic activity of NS and NP in H2SO4 might
be surface poisoning by sulfate ions.68−70 The ORR catalytic activities
analyzed in KOH and PBS solutions using cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
at 10 mV/s scan rate are plotted in Figure 4a,b, respectively. Figure 4a clearly shows an anodic shift in the ORR
onset potentials of NS and NP in comparison to carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
which are close to the Pt/C in KOH solutions (see Figure S5); however, the onset potentials of NS, NP, and CNT
are almost similar as the pH decreased to 7.0 (Figure 4b), indicating the influence of pH on the
catalytic activity of VSe2. Consistent results were obtained
in rotating disk electrode (RDE) experiments, as shown in Figure 4c,d. The RDE results
at all rotations for the Pt/C, glassy carbon (GC), CNT, NP, and NS
catalysts in KOH and PBS are plotted in Figures S5 and S6, respectively. The Tafel slopes obtained at NS and
NP cases (from Figure 4c,d) are close to 120 mV/dec, which implies that the first step is
a rate-limiting step for the ORR, as shown in Figure S7. Furthermore, the fitting lines in Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) catalysts (Figure 4e,f) between j–1 and ω–1(where j is the measured limiting
current and ω is the electrode rotating rate) are plotted to
estimate the number of electrons transferred per oxygen molecule (η)
involved in the ORR and related kinetics parameters (for details,
see Supporting Information). In the KOH
and PBS solutions, the number of electrons involved in the ORR at
NS and NP was ∼2.8, which shows that the ORR proceeds through
parallel mechanism of two electrons (via H2O2 formation) and four electrons (direct reduction to H2O); however, CNT undergo two-electron ORR through production of H2O2. In both KOH and PBS, exchange current density
(i0) and kinetic current density (jk) values were higher than those of the CNT
for NS and NP, providing catalytic activity toward ORR. These results
clearly signify that NS and NP morphologies do not have a significant
effect on their ORR catalytic activities. Table 1 summarizes the corresponding data for all
catalysts. Essentially, the number of electrons involved in the ORR
at NP and NS in the alkaline and PBS solution follows parallel (k1 = k2 and k3 = 0) and serial (k2 = 2 × k3 and k1 = 0) pathways shown in Scheme 1.71 In contrast,
ORR at the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and CNT follows peroxo mechanism
and the serial pathway (k2 = k3 and k1 = 0) favorably with
a two-electron process. According to the Sabatier principle, ORR catalytic
activity is influenced by the strength of adsorbed reactants, products,
or intermediates.13,72 Thus, ORR catalysis in sulfuric
acid, at the NP and NS, might be poor due to strongly adsorbed sulfate
ions, which lead to weak interaction with O2 and intermediates
resulting inefficient ORR catalysis.

Water Splitting:
Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Hydrogen
Evolution Reaction (HER)
OER is a four-electron process,
and the step of water splitting is generally considered as the major
kinetic obstacle of the whole water splitting due to multiple electron
transfers during the formation of an O–O bond.8 Although OER is a thermodynamically reverse process of
ORR, change in the liquid to gas phase leads to a different mechanism.
Some of the TMDs have already proved to be efficient catalysts for
the OER of cobalt, nickel, mixed metal selenides, and so forth.15 Tahir et. al. reported that surface morphologies
can change due to electrochemical treatment.11 The effect of NS and NP morphologies at different pHs on the OER
catalytic activities were realized using KOH, PBS (pH 7.0), and H2SO4 solutions. The higher onset potential obtained
in OER catalysis of NS and NP in H2SO4 than
CNT (Figure S8a) could be attributed to
surface poisoning of NS and NP in H2SO4 solution
and thus diminishing of active surface area.

Figure 5 illustrates the water splitting
electrocatalytic activity of NSs and NPs in KOH and PBS. The catalytic
activity is effective when the reaction is catalyzed at low potential
(i.e., onset potentials for OER and HER shift to cathodic and anodic
potentials, respectively). Figure 5a clearly shows that the onset potential for OER of
NP shifts cathodically by 150 mV in comparison to CNT, whereas NS
was similar to CNT. As per convention, the potentials required for
different catalysts to deliver a current density of 10 mA/cm2 (Ej=10, overpotential
value at 10% of an efficient solar water splitting device73) are compared and summarized in Table S2. Ej for NP (i.e., 2.49 V) was higher than the superior state-of-the-art
OER catalyst IrO2 with Ej = 1.58 V. Although OER is catalyzed at the NP surface, it
has a high Tafel slope of 189 mV/dec (Figure S9 and Table S2), indicating slow kinetics in comparison to IrO2, but better than CNT. In the PBS solution, both the NSs and
NPs are not efficient catalysts because onset potential is more anodic
than that obtained for CNT (Figure 5b). On the basis of these results, it can be hypothesized
that OH– ions are necessary for OER catalysis of
NPs.

Figure 5 LSVs of OER (a, b) and HER (c, d) in N2-saturated 0.1
M KOH (a, c) and 0.5 M PBS (pH 7.0) solutions (b, d).

The HER performance of catalysts is also assessed
at different
pHs and summarized in Table S2 in addition
to their catalytic activities for OER. As can be seen in the LSV curves
(Figure 5c) of VSe2, NS can perform well as an outstanding HER catalyst in 1.0
M KOH electrolyte with an onset potential of about −250 mV
(shown in Table S3), which is not as good
as the commercial Pt catalyst (243 mV), however, much better than
the CNT having onset potential −760 mV. In addition, NP also
shows a similar HER catalytic activity with an onset potential of
−260 mV. Therefore, it can be concluded that VSe2 is an efficient catalyst for HER in alkaline solution. Morphology,
however, does not have a significant effect on the catalytic activity
in alkaline solution. The onset potential for HER shows little difference
for NSs and NPs in PBS (Figure 5d). Interestingly, NPs have been proven to be an efficient
HER catalyst in the H2SO4 solution, whereas
NSs exhibit poor activity for HER with a cathodic onset potential
of 400 mV (Figure S8b). This poor catalytic
behavior of NS is actually consistent with the previous results,37 where it is suggested that the degree of exfoliation
can drastically affect the HER performance of the catalysts. A possible
reason for the lower HER activity of NSs in H2SO4 is the fact that sulfate ions have stronger interaction with 2D
NSs rather than the 3D NPs; thus, it can be removed more easily at
negative potentials on the NP surface than the NS during hydrogen
evolution. Thus, the morphology of catalyst plays an important role
in selecting efficient catalyst for HER in acidic media. Revisiting
the ORR and OER results, the low catalytic activity in acidic media
could be attributed to the poisoning of the catalyst by H+ and/or SO42– ions, which is in line
with the HER catalysis results of NS; however, NP confirms its efficient
catalytic activity toward HER in H2SO4. To be
able to evaluate these findings, the HER process should be also revisited.
Essentially, the HER reaction can proceed through the Volmer–Tafel
(reactions 1 and 2) or Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (reactions 1 and 3).7,12−14,50 As per the nudged elastic band method, HER at TMDs follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky
mechanism.74 Commonly, the first step in
the HER at transition-metal selenides proceeds via hydrogen binding
to selenium, which creates vacancy via desorption of hydrogen selenide.
Thus, hydrogen-binding energy (ΔGH) and hydrogen selenide binding energy (ΔGHS) are important to realize catalytic activity and its
stability.7 1   2   3  According to the literature, VSe2 can exist as metallic TMD in either the 2H trigonal prismatic or
1T octahedral coordination60,74 and HER can be catalyzed
at the basal planes or at the edges. Theoretically, ΔGHS and ΔGH values at 2H coordination have been reported as −0.57 and
0.62 for basal plane; −0.81 and 0.61 for V-edge; and −0.17
and 0.25 for Se-edge, respectively. Furthermore, ΔGHS and ΔGH values at
1T coordination are −0.21 and 0.39 for basal plane and −0.17
and 0.25 for edges, respectively.74 The
present study shows that HER was catalyzed at NP and NS in the KOH
solution; however, only NP in H2SO4 and both
morphologies were inactive at neutral pH. Thus, it clearly proves
that hydrogen-ion concentration may be one of the causes to change
ΔGHS, resulting in HER catalysis
being affected by pH. The 2H and 1T coordination influences HER catalytic
activity due to the difference in their ΔGHS and ΔGH values. In the
case of NP and NS, the ratio of 2H and 1T might be different, which
can be one rational of HER catalysis at NP and inactivity of NS in
H2SO4 solution. Thus, catalysis in H2SO4 can be influenced by sulfate-ion poisoning as well
as the difference in the hydrogen-binding energies during the HER.

We further tested the durability of the catalysts by successive
CV scanning at a rate of 100 mV/s for 500 cycles. As observed in Figure S10, the VSe2 NPs and NSs have
minor capacitive differences in all three solutions suggesting that
they do not dissolve in the solution during cycling and that the overall
electrochemically active area remains constant in acidic, alkaline,
and neutral pH.

Conclusions
In this work, we conducted
a systematic electrochemical analysis
on the VSe2 2D nanosheets and 3D nanoparticles. For this
aim, first, we introduced a large-scale-compatible and surfactant-free
route to obtain VSe2 nanoparticles and nanosheets in high
yield. In this synthesis, NPs are produced using laser ablation method.
Further, we exfoliate them to obtain VSe2 NSs, using a
Li-based intercalation assisted by sonication. In belief, the proposed
synthesis method will be equally applicable to other layered TMDs,
which can be used for the mass production of 2D nanosheets. Afterward,
we performed a comprehensive study on the electrochemical properties
of the synthesized structures and showed that the electrocatalytic
activity depends on the morphology of the catalyst in alkaline, neutral,
and acidic mediums. To summarize, the effect of different morphologies
is noticeable only in the HER catalytic activities in H2SO4 solution. Both the NP and NS show ORR activity in
KOH and PBS; however, they are inactive in the H2SO4 solution. NP proves to be a competent OER catalyst in KOH,
whereas a similar activity is attained by NS in the PBS solution.
These results clearly demonstrate that the NS and NP shapes of the
VSe2 catalyst can influence their catalytic activities
depending on the pH of solutions. Thus, selection of proper morphology
of catalyst is necessary to conclude its catalytic activity toward
ORR and water splitting.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Reagents
All chemicals were used as received
without further purification. Nafion solution (Dupont DE520, 5 wt
%), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, 99.99%), and
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
and VSe2 crystal rock (>99.995%) was supplied by HQ
Graphene.
Deionized water (18 MΩ/cm) is used in all experiments.

VSe2 Nanoparticles (VSe2 NPs) Synthesis
The PLA technique
was modified on the basis of our previously reported
method.75 In brief, a Nufern NuQ fiber
laser (NUQA-1064-NA-0030-F1) is operated at ambient temperature with
1064 nm wavelength, 100 ns pulse width duration, 30 kHz pulse repetition
rate/frequency, and 1 mJ pulse energy. To synthesize the VSe2 colloidal nanoparticles, VSe2 rock is used as a bulk
target, which is covered by deionized water, and the water height
over the target is adjusted to be ∼1 cm. The laser beam is
focused on the VSe2 target (1 cm diameter active area),
immersed in deionized water, with a spot size of about 3.8 mm diameter
using a 200 mm focal length taking into account the refraction through
the water. The ablation was carried out for 200 loops using the stationary
beam (at a fluence amount of 30 mJ/cm2) to produce nanoparticles
with a wide size distribution (10–100 nm).

Lithium Intercalation
of VSe2 Nanosheets (VSe2NSs)
The intercalation
reactions were performed by
adding 10 mg of Li2CO3 into 2 mL of VSe2 NP solutions, with a molar Li excess of roughly 2:1. Then,
the solution was dispersed by ultrasonication for 2 h.

Ink Preparation
The slurries (ink) for RDE measurements
were prepared by mixing 8 mg of MWCNT, 60 μL of Nafion solution
(5 wt %), 100 μL of ethanol, 500 μL of DI water, and 160
μL of VSe2 NP or NS solution (∼16 mg) as electrocatalyst.
In the absence of VSe2, ink solutions are prepared by adding
the same amount of DI water (160 μL) to the ink solution. Next,
the sample was stored for characterization.

Materials Characterization
To characterize the structural
properties of the synthesized VSe2 NPs and NSs, a transmission
electron microscope (Tecnai G2-F30, FEI) operated at 200 kV was used.
For TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurements, a few droplets
of the solution were dispersed on a lacey carbon-coated copper grid.
Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of samples were
also collected to understand the growth direction and crystallinity
of the prepared nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,
Thermoscientific K-Alpha, Al Kα radiation, hυ = 1486.6 eV) measurement was performed at survey mode by
operating flood gun to prevent surface charging with the pass energy
and step size set to 30 and 0.1 eV, respectively. The peak positions
were calibrated by referencing the C 1s peak position (284.8 eV) and
shifting other peaks in the spectrum accordingly. Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) was carried out by PANalytical X’pert Multi-Purpose
Diffractometer, and the patterns were collected in the 2θ range
of 10–70° using Bragg–Brentano geometry (Cu Kα
radiation). The VSe2 solutions were drop-cast onto the
sheet of thin glass at room temperature. Finally, the height profile
and layer thickness were evaluated from the tapping mode atomic force
microscopy (AFM, PSIA).

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements
were performed using a rotating disk electrode (RDE, SP-150, Bio-Logic
Science Instruments) in a standard three-electrode electrochemical
cell configuration with catalyst-loaded GCE, Pt spiral wire, and Ag|AgCl|KCl(sat) as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.
For the convenience of comparison, all potentials measured vs Ag|AgCl|KCl(sat) were reported versus RHE and all of the calculations
were based on the geometric surface area, unless specified.

The GCE is renewed by polishing with 1 μm diamond particle
slurry and then with 0.05 μm alumina powder on the polishing
pad. Finally, it is washed ultrasonically with DI water and ethanol
for 10 min each and dried at room temperature to make a homogenous
film on the GC electrode surface. For performance comparison, the
GCE surfaces were investigated in this study by depositing Pt/C, CNT,
NP, and NS and comparing with bare GCE. As working electrode, 6 μL
of the catalyst ink was loaded on the GCE (3 mm diameter and 0.07068
cm2 geometric surface area) and dried at room temperature
for electrochemical measurements.

The electrochemical measurements
were performed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, 0.5 M, pH 7.02), potassium hydroxide (0.1 M KOH), and
sulfuric acid (0.5 M H2SO4) solutions, and prior
to each measurement, the electrolyte solution was saturated with either
N2 or O2 gas (99.999% purity) for 40 min.

Oxygen Reduction
Reaction (ORR)
Rotating disk electrode
(RDE) measurements were performed in an O2-saturated KOH
and PBS solution to assess the ORR activity and kinetics of the Pt/C,
GCE, CNT, NP, and NS catalysts with different rotation speeds of 100,
225, 400, 625, and 900 rpm at 25 °C at a scan rate of 10 mV/s.

Water Splitting: Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Hydrogen
Evolution Reaction (HER)
The OER and HER catalytic activities
of the samples were recorded by LSVs in N2-saturated 1.0
M KOH, 0.5 M PBS, and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions
at a scan rate of 10 mV/s at room temperature.
