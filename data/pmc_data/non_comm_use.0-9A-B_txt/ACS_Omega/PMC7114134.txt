Iris sibirica biomass (ISBM) used
for cobalt (Co) pollution remediation was prepared by one-step pyrolysis
and employed to remove elemental mercury (Hg0) from flue
gas. Results showed that the ISBM pyrolyzed at 700 °C (ISBM700)
exhibited good Hg0 removal performance (about 86%) at 150
°C. The existence of NO and O2 facilitated the removal
of Hg0, while SO2 and water vapor inhibited
it. Characterization analysis (including N2 adsorption–desorption,
X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry) showed
that ISBM700 has a relatively higher specific surface area, a quantity
of lattice oxygen derived from well-dispersed amorphous-phase CoOx, and abundant oxygen functional groups.
A Mars–Maessen mechanism is thought to be involved in the Hg0 removal process. The adsorbed Hg0 could be oxidized
to HgO by the surface oxygen species derived from CoOx, and then, the consumed surface oxygen species can
be replenished by O2. Therefore, the Co-contaminated I. sibirica biomass (CCIB) from phytoremediation
could be utilized for Hg0 removal after being pyrolyzed
instead of any chemical modification.

1 Introduction
Mercury
is considered to be a highly hazardous pollutant because
of its persistent and serious toxicity to both environmental and human
health.1,2 Although trace concentrations are present
in coal, a large amount of Hg is released from coal-fired power plants
worldwide into the atmosphere annually.3 Different coal ranks and production site operating conditions result
in a variety of forms of Hg being present in the final flue gas. The
mercury species present in flue gas can be divided into three forms:
elemental mercury (Hg0), oxidized mercury (Hg2+), and particulate-bound mercury (Hgp).1,4 Among
them, Hg2+ and Hgp can be effectively captured
through wet flue gas desulfurization or dust-removal systems (such
as fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators).5 However, Hg0 accounts for more than 75% of total
Hg6 and is difficult to remove via existing
air pollution control devices because of its stability, highly volatility,
and insolubility in water.1,5 Therefore, it is imperative
to develop systems that ensure the removal of Hg0.

In recent years, a number of technologies have been widely investigated
and developed to remove mercury (especially Hg0) from coal-fired
flue gas, in order to comply with the increasingly stringent environmental
emission standards. As an effective technology for mercury removal,
activated carbon has mercury holding capacity because of the abundant
porous structure.7 To enhance the mercury
capacity, some chemicals that have high affinity performance, such
as sulfur,8 halogens,9 and transition metal oxides,10−12 have been used to modify
carbon-based sorbents. Among these, adsorbents/carriers modified with
transition metal oxides (such as Co,10,11,13−15 Fe,12,14 Cu,16 V,17,18 Mn,19,20 and Ce21,22) exhibit excellent mercury removal performance
because of their oxidation and enhanced chemisorption capacity for
Hg3. Because of their excellent catalytic activity at low
temperatures, the cobalt-based materials have become a preferred option
for Hg0 removal through a cold-side catalyst bed. Akira
et al.23 reported that elemental mercury
can adsorb to the surface of CoOx-based
carbon catalysts and react with the lattice oxygen to form HgO, with
the synergistic adsorption and oxidation effects, greatly enhancing
Hg removal.13 However, the cost of Co oxides
is high and the loading process is complex. Moreover, the two-step
preparation process (including the preparation of activated carbon
and the loading of Co oxides) evidently increases the manufacturing
cost.

On the other hand, Co and its associated compounds are
widely distributed
in nature and play a significant role in numerous anthropogenic activities
and industries such as in hard metal,24 construction,25,26 pigment and paint production,27,28 and electronic device production.29−31 However, the extensive
use and overexploitation of Co have caused serious environmental pollution
of water and soils.32−36 Although Co has a biologically necessary role as a metal constituent
of vitamin B12,37 excessive intake of Co
and its compounds can lead to its bioaccumulation, resulting in serious
toxic effects on humans and animals.35,36,38,39 In China, because of
implementation of the “Action plan for prevention and control
of water pollution”40 and “Action
plan for prevention and control of soil pollution”,41 increasing attention has been paid to the remediation
of heavy metal pollution. Iris sibirica is an important phytoremediation plant, which has been widely used
in Co pollution treatment and exhibits good performance generally
in environmental remediation.42,43 However, to the best
of our knowledge, little research has been undertaken on the application
of Co-enriched biomass in pollution removal, despite it being a potentially
valuable resource in the field of adsorption and catalysis.

For this background, biological matter (such as straw) which has
been used for Co pollution remediation might be utilized directly
after pyrolysis, without the need to add Co by chemical modification,
improving the adsorption capacity of ordinary biochar materials and
utilizing available waste biomass resources. Activated carbon materials
containing cobalt oxide might be prepared by one-step pyrolysis for
the regeneration and utilization of this kind of biomass, which obviously
solves the problems of high cost of transition metal loading and increasing
investment cost by the two-step preparation process. According to
research by Tao et al.,44,45 different pyrolysis
processes may have varying effects on the surface active sites of
biochar, especially oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., carbonyl
group and ester group),44−49 which is highly beneficial for the removal of Hg0.47,49 Liu et al.49,50 reported that different pyrolysis
temperatures could not only lead to the enrichment of different metal
elements but also affect the existing form of metal elements. However,
it is not clear whether the CCIB can be directly pyrolyzed at appropriate
temperature to produce cobalt oxide-containing biomass carbon for
Hg0 removal.

With the purpose of utilization of the I. sibirica plant material previously used for the
remediation of Co pollution,
the comprehensive effects of different pyrolysis temperatures were
assessed on biochar surface features and the form of Co species present.
N2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
(FTIR), thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were applied to
characterize samples. The role of flue gas components (O2, NO, SO2, and H2O) in removal of Hg0 were also investigated. Furthermore, the mechanisms involved in
Hg0 removal using the CCIB were discussed according to
biomass characterization and experimental results. The ultimate goal
of this study was to utilize recycled CCIB for Hg removal from coal
combustion flue gas, which may hold much promise for future industrial
application.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Biomass Feedstock and I. sibirica Biochar Preparation
CCIB was cultivated by nutrient source
culture, with the detailed cultivation method described in 1.1 of
the Supporting Information. After harvesting,
the biomass samples (including rhizomes and stems) were dried at 105
°C, milled using a cutting mill (Retsch SM 2000, Haan, Germany),
and filtered through a 50-mesh sieve, allowing the collection of particles
that were <300 μm in diameter. The particles were dry-stored
until required for experiments. The raw particles were then pyrolyzed
using a temperature-programmed tube furnace with a temperature increase
rate of 5 °C/min at different temperatures of 300, 500, 600,
700, and 900 °C for 1 h under a continual flow of nitrogen (250
mL/min). The pyrolyzed I. sibirica biomass
samples were denoted as ISBM300, ISBM500, ISBM600, ISBM700, and ISBM900,
according to the pyrolysis temperature applied, respectively.

2.2 Adsorbent Characterization
The phase
distributions of metals in ISBM were analyzed by inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS, Thermo Fisher, US). The specific
surface areas (BET method) of different samples were assessed by nitrogen
physisorption and desorption at liquid nitrogen temperatures (ASAP2020,
Micromeritics Inc., US). The pore volume and pore size of samples
were calculated according to the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. FT-IR (VERTEX 70, Bruker, Germany) was used to determine
the adsorbent functional group species distribution, under different
pyrolysis conditions. The biochar microcosmic appearance and structure
were investigated by SEM (Zeiss Sigma, UK). XRD patterns were recorded
using a MiniFlex600 powder diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). In order
to assess the valence change of Co oxides under different pyrolysis
conditions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo
Fisher, US) analysis was used to determine the binding energies of
Co 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and Hg 4f with Al Kα (hν
= 1486.6 eV). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using
an STA6000 simultaneous thermal analyzer (PerkinElmer, US). The treated
ISBM was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min under air conditions, with a flow rate of 40
mL/min.

2.3 Activity Test
Hg0 removal
tests were performed in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed system (Figure 1). In each test,
400 mg of ISBM adsorbents was transferred to the quartz tube reactor,
which was placed in the thermostat drying oven. The quartz tube (i.d.
10 mm) was placed in a tubular electric furnace equipped with a temperature
control system. Before samples were transferred to the reactor, Hg
vapor was generated using a Hg permeation tube (HE-SR, VICI Metronics,
US), carried by N2, and mixed thoroughly with other gases
in a buffer tank. The Hg0 concentration was controlled
to approximately 40 μg/m3 in this system. Basic gas
(BG) composed of N2, with 6% vol O2 and 40 μg/m3 Hg0, was fed to the quartz tube reactor with a
total flow rate of 1000 mL/min, corresponding to a space velocity
of about 30,000 h–1. The simulated flue gas (SFG)
consisted of N2, with 6% vol O2, 0–8%
vol H2O, 0–1000 ppm SO2, and 0–1000
ppm NO. All gas pipes after water bath were heated via a heating tape
to maintain a constant temperature of 95 °C to prevent Hg deposition.
Hg0 concentrations were measured in the inlet and outlet
gas via a cold vapor atomic adsorption spectrometer analyzer (SG-921,
China). Before the start of each test, the system was stabilized for
at least 30 min to obtain constant SFG and Hg concentrations. Mean
values were obtained from the analysis of three replicate tests to
reduce uncertainties. The Ontario Hydro method (OHM) was used to confirm
the experimental accuracy. A detailed description of the operation
of the OHM system is presented in Section 1.2 of the Supporting Information. The instantaneous Hg removal efficiency
(η) of sorbents were calculated by comparing the Hg0 concentrations in the reactor inlet and outlet, as shown in eq 1 1  where Cinlet and Coutlet represent
the instantaneous Hg concentration
(μg/m3) in the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Adsorbents
3.1.1 ISBM
Adsorbent Properties under Different
Pyrolysis Temperatures
Identification of the composition
of metal elements in ISBM materials was performed by ICP–MS.
The most abundant metal elements in biochar and their yield are shown
in Table 1. With increasing
pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 900 °C, the biochar yield
decreased from 62.8 to 33.8% because of greater decomposition of organic
matter at higher temperatures. Among the elements detected in biochar
materials, the most abundant metal element was Co, followed by calcium
(Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), sodium
(Na), and manganese (Mn). All ISBM metal element concentrations increased
with higher pyrolysis temperatures, although compared with Co, the
abundance of other metals can be considered as noncatalytic performance
or trace concentrations. It was reported that the oxide of cobalt
exhibited excellent performance of catalytic oxidation of Hg0.10,11,13−15 Co, as the most abundant metal element of the material, might be
the dominant factor affecting the Hg0 removal performance
of ISBM.

3.1.2 N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Analysis
The surface textural properties of biochar formed
at various pyrolysis temperatures are summarized in Table 1. It was observed that the BET
specific surface area, total pore volume, and average pore diameter
were greatly influenced by pyrolysis temperature. The measured surface
area was significantly lower on biochar prepared at pyrolysis temperatures
below 500 °C, at 4.9 m2/g, increasing to 338.8 m2/g with temperatures of 900 °C, indicating a more carbonaceous
and aromatic biochar matrix structure.51 According to previous research by Kumar et al., macadamia nutshell
biochar releases volatiles gases at higher pyrolysis temperatures,52 improving the BET specific surface area and
total pore volume of the biochar material. As shown in Figure 2, as the pyrolysis temperature
increases, more gaseous species are released during the pyrolysis
of the biomass, which results in a decrease in the average pore size
and an increase in total pore volume.51 However, the average pore diameter increased when the pyrolysis
temperature was further increased to greater than 600 °C, which
may be due to the removal of greater amounts of labile materials at
higher temperatures.53 It is generally
accepted that higher pyrolysis temperatures produce biochar with larger
specific surface areas and larger total pore volumes, which are favorable
for Hg0 adsorption and oxidation.14

size distribution of ISBM produced at different pyrolysis
temperatures.

3.1.3 SEM
Analysis
Figure 3 presents the SEM images of ISBM at various
pyrolysis temperatures. SEM images show that few particles exist on
the surface of ISBM when pyrolyzed at 300 °C. With increasing
pyrolysis temperatures, a greater number of small amorphous phase
particles appeared on the surface of biochar materials. Combined with
the results of ICP–MS analysis, these findings indicate that
some metal compounds, such as Co and Ca, were exposed at higher pyrolysis
temperatures. When the temperature increased to 900 °C, the size
of amorphous phase particles significantly increased and some crystalline
substances could be observed on the surface of biochar. According
to the research of Zhang et al.,54,55 the agglomeration
of catalysts on carrier surfaces is unfavorable for the catalytic
oxidation of Hg0. Furthermore, some very small crystal
particles appeared on the surface of ISBM900, which may be due to
the reduction of metal oxides by carbon at higher pyrolysis temperatures.
To define the particle species, samples were further investigated
using XPS and XRD technologies.

ISBM under different pyrolysis
temperatures.

3.1.4 XRD
Analysis
The XRD patterns of
samples pyrolyzed at various temperatures are shown in Figure 4. The only peaks observed when
pyrolysis temperatures were below 700 °C were C (PDF 26-1076)
at 2θ = 26.603 and 44.669°. For ISBM900, obvious diffraction
peaks were present at 2θ = 44.216, 51.522, and 75.853°,
which were ascribed to Co0 (PDF 15-0806). The presence
of Co0 was ascribed to the reduction of Co with high valence
by carbon at high pyrolysis temperatures. In addition, small diffraction
peaks detected at 2θ = 17.190, 25.917, 28.090, 31.260, and 34.673°
were attributed to Ca2.6Co0.4(PO4)2 (PDF 40-0182); 2θ = 40.719, 40.971, 42.049, 43.297,
44.073, 48.706, and 52.030° were attributed to Co2P (PDF 32-0306); and 2θ = 13.847, 23.516, 27.893, and 49.960°
were attributed to NaAlSi3O8 (PDF 09-0466).
This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that high pyrolysis
temperature leads to the transformation of the metallic amorphous
phase material into the crystalline phase material, and metal oxides
are reduced under the condition of high pyrolysis temperature. Furthermore,
no well-defined peaks related to Co species were found, indicating
good dispersion of Co species existing mainly in an amorphous phase,
and further discussion will be discussed in the XPS Analysis section.
According to previous studies, high concentrations of amorphous or
well-dispersed CoxOy could lead to an increased mercury oxidation effect.13,15 Overall, CCIB pyrolyzed at a temperature of 700 °C seemed to
have higher concentrations of smaller amorphous particles, which might
lead to an enhanced Hg0 removal efficiency.

under various temperatures.

3.1.5 XPS Analysis
In order to identify
the chemical states of the major elements present and obtain better
insight into the effect of pyrolysis temperature on biochar materials,
samples were examined by XPS. XPS spectra (Figure 5a) confirmed the coexistence of Co, C, and
O in biochar and the absence of other impurity elements. As shown
in Figure 5b, the Co
2p spectrum of biochar obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures
exhibited two major peaks at 780.5 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 795.8
eV (Co 2p1/2) with two satellite peaks at 785.6 and 803
eV.56−58 With pyrolysis temperatures of up to 700 °C,
Co 2p3/2 could be deconvoluted into four peaks, where the
presence of a peak at 782 eV and a satellite peak at about 788.5 eV
indicated the existence of Co2+ and peaks at 788.85 and
780.3 eV corresponded to Co3+.15 Based on quantitative analysis of the Co 2p3/2 XPS spectra
(Table 2), the Co2+ concentration decreased from 66.4 to 55.4% with increasing
pyrolysis temperatures from 300 to 700 °C. These results indicate
that increasing temperatures are beneficial to the transformation
of Co2+ to Co3+. Meanwhile, the increased Co3+ is generally favorable for Hg0 oxidation. However,
when the temperature increases to 900 °C, a new peak emerges
at 778.2 eV, corresponding to Co0 with an atomic concentration
of 30.8%. Combined with the XRD analysis results, these findings indicate
that excessive pyrolysis temperatures lead to a reduction in cobalt,
and therefore, the proportion of Co3+ is reduced.

The O 1s XPS results are displayed in Figure 5c and Table 2. The O 1s peaks could be deconvoluted into three peaks,
attributed to the adsorbed −OH groups or molecular water at
532.8 eV (denoted as Oα′), chemisorbed oxygen
at 531.4 eV (denoted as Oα), and lattice oxygen at
∼530.4 eV (denoted as Oβ).15 Oβ was not detected in ISBM300 and had
an abundance of only 8.4% in ISBM500, implying that Co2+ and Co3+ did not exist in the form of metal oxides at
lower pyrolysis temperatures. However, when pyrolysis temperatures
were increased to 600 and 700 °C, the presence of Oβ increased to 64.7 and 40.8%, respectively, implying that cobalt
oxide is produced at these pyrolysis temperatures. Various previous
studies have proposed that the presence of CoOx contributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies and unsaturated
chemical bonds on the surface of catalysts, benefiting the removal
of Hg0. According to Wan et al.,59,60 Oα species generated from defected oxides, including
O2–, O22–, and O–, were considered to be the most active oxygen species
in the catalytic oxidation of Hg0. ISBM700 possessed higher
Oα concentrations in comparison with ISBM600 and
ISBM900, demonstrating that the careful selection of appropriate pyrolysis
temperature allows the selection for increased proportions of chemisorbed
oxygen.

As shown in Figure 5d and Table 2, for
analysis of biochar formed at different pyrolysis temperatures, the
C 1s core peaks were separated into six components. For biochar pyrolyzed
at temperatures of up to 500 °C, the spectra could only be deconvoluted
into four peaks: peak a (C–C and C–H binding) at 284.0
eV,61 peak b (C–OH) at 285.5 eV,
peak c (C–O) at 286.5 eV, and peak d (C=O) at 288.1
eV.62 When the temperature increased to
600 °C, a new peak belonging to carbide was observed at 283.1
eV.61 In ISBM900, a new peak emerged at
284.45 eV corresponding to C=C bonds (atomic proportion of
16.4%), indicating the presence of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite.52 With increasing pyrolysis temperatures, the
abundance of carbonyl groups exhibited an increasing trend, while
C–OH and C–O displayed a fuzzy rule of change. According
to an analysis of different activated carbons by Tao et al.,44,45 some types of oxygen functional groups, especially the carbonyl
group (C=O), contain active sites for Hg0 capture,
with the mechanism of Hg adsorption involving an electron transfer
process.44,47

3.1.6 FTIR Analysis
FTIR was used to
analyze the functional groups present on the surface of samples obtained
at pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 300 to 900 °C. The FTIR
spectra in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 cm–1 are shown in Figure 6. The FTIR spectra of samples changed with pyrolysis temperature,
indicating structural re-arrangements during the formation of biochar.
The broad band visible at about 3427.57 cm–1 was
attributed to the −OH stretching vibration of hydrogen-bound
hydroxyl groups.63,64 Additionally, the peak visible
at 1610 cm–1 was attributed to C–O stretching
and bending vibrations,65 and the peaks
in the region of 1730 and 865 cm–1 were related
to C=O or C=C stretching vibration.69 The weaker band visible at 1320 cm–1 was
attributed to esters,65 epoxides, and acyclic
C–O–C groups, which could be seen at pyrolysis temperatures
of 300 and 500 °C, but disappeared at higher temperatures. The
peak at 1033 cm–1 was attributed to C–O–H
bonds in cellulose and to the C–O stretching vibration of alcohols
(R–OH) and aliphatic ethers.64 According
to the previous findings of Tan et al.,47 oxygen functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O) and ester/lactone
(C(O)–O–C) groups are the active sites for Hg0 capture, which are conducive to an improvement in Hg removal. The
bands visible at 2923.01 and 1441.19 cm–1 were assigned
to aliphatic −CH3 and −CH2 stretching
vibrations, which became weaker and eventually disappeared with increasing
pyrolysis temperatures.63,64 These results indicate
that different pyrolysis temperatures could affect the occurrence
and quantity of some functional groups, which may affect the removal
of Hg0.

temperatures.

3.2 Hg0 Removal Tests
3.2.1 Determination of the
Reaction Temperature
Range of Biochar Samples
Previous studies have indicated
that the operational temperature for Hg0 removal catalysts
is mostly between 100 and 400 °C.44,63 Because of
the low ignition temperature, biochar is likely to burn at high temperatures
and therefore, TG-DTC curves were operated under air conditions (about
21% O2) to determine the working temperature range. As
depicted in Figure 7, a slight weight loss of about 3% was observed when the operating
temperature increased from 25 to 300 °C. However, the majority
of weight loss (65%) occurred within the temperature range of 300–500
°C. Results clearly show that the ignition temperature of ISBM700
was 300 °C. We performed a similar test of the ignition temperature
of ISBMs in a tube furnace and also found that the ignition temperature
under air conditions was around 300 °C. Therefore, in order to
ensure the catalytic performance of ISBM, the operational temperature
should be controlled at no more than 300 °C. In the present study,
50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 °C were selected as operating temperatures
for further investigation.

Figure 7 TG-DTG curves of ISBM700.

3.2.2 Hg0 Removal Test
The
Hg0 removal efficiency of ISBM formed at various pyrolysis
temperatures was investigated under different reaction temperature
conditions. As shown in Figure 8, ISBM300 and ISBM500 exhibited poor Hg0 removal
activity from 50–250 °C, with removal efficiency not reaching
greater than 20% within this temperature range. The more oxygen-containing
functional groups of the samples produced at lower pyrolysis temperatures
(Table 2) and their
poor Hg0 removal efficiency showed that oxygen-containing
functional groups were not dominant in the catalytic oxidation of
Hg0 compared with that of CoOx. These results may be due to the comprehensive effects of poor BET
surface area and low abundance of CoOx (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 5) on the surface of biochar when pyrolyzed at lower temperatures.
With ISBM600, ISBM700, and ISBM900, the Hg0 removal efficiency
initially increased with greater reaction temperatures, while the
Hg0 removal efficiency decreased when the reaction temperature
increased further to >200 °C. This is likely to be due to
the
combined effects of inhibition of physisorption of Hg0 and
desorption of the adsorbed HgO.13 When
the reaction temperature was about 150 °C, the ISBM exhibited
a relatively high Hg0 removal efficiency and increased
in the following order: ISBM300 < ISBM500 < ISBM900 < ISBM600
< ISBM700. The results of the OHM experiment, as shown in Figure S1, manifested that the removal of mercury
by ISBM700 was presented in the oxidized and adsorbed forms, suggestive
of the reduction of Hg0 due to heterogeneous oxidation
and physisorption/chemisorption. Combined with the results of characterization
analysis using BET, SEM, XRD, FTIR, and XPS, the biochar formed at
pyrolysis temperatures of 700 °C exhibited a relatively larger
BET surface and a higher concentration of well-dispersed amorphous
CoOx, all of which contribute to improved
removal of Hg0. These results indicate that the optimal
reaction temperature was around 150 °C, while the optimal pyrolysis
temperature was 700 °C, corresponding to an Hg0 removal
efficiency of 86%.

h–1; stable time: 60 min.

3.3 Effect of Flue Gas Components on Hg0 Removal
3.3.1 Effect of O2
Gas-phase
oxygen is normally necessary for the removal of Hg0.13,64 In order to detect the effects of O2 on the Hg removal
performance of Co-contaminated biochar, the activity of ISBM700 was
tested at various O2 concentrations in a Hg0-containing atmosphere. As shown in Figure 9a, without the addition of O2,
the average Hg removal efficiency was less than 60% and decreased
after 1 h. With increased O2 concentrations of up to 3%,
the Hg removal efficiency increased to 70% and exhibited a slightly
decreasing trend after a certain reaction period. These results indicate
that the removal of Hg0 might comprise some chemical reactions
with O2. According to the Mars–Maessen mechanism,
Hg0 can be initially adsorbed onto the surface active sites
of catalysts and then react with lattice oxygen and/or chemisorbed
oxygen to form weakly bound speciation of Hg–O–M–Ox–1 (M = Co in this research) prior
to forming HgO. Then, the consumed lattice oxygen and/or chemisorbed
oxygen can be replenished by gas-phase oxygen.13,19 However, without the presence of gas-phase O2, the limited
supply of lattice oxygen and/or chemisorbed oxygen will be gradually
consumed. Furthermore, concentrations of 3% O2 were found
to be insufficient for complete replenishment of lattice oxygen and/or
chemisorbed oxygen, while an increase in oxygen content to 6% caused
the Hg0 removal efficiency to increase significantly. However,
there was no obvious increase in Hg0 removal efficiency
when the O2 concentration was further increased to 9%.
Overall, gas-phase oxygen was found to play an important role in Hg
removal, with O2 concentrations of 6% found to be optimal.

300, 600, and 1000 ppm; and (d) 6% O2, H2O concentration

3.3.2 Effect
of NO on Hg0 Removal
In coal-fired flue gas, the
NO concentration exceeded that of Hg0 by about four orders
of magnitude and, therefore, may have
an effect on the removal of Hg0. As shown in Figure 9b, increasing NO concentrations
significantly enhanced the Hg removal efficiency of biochar. This
stimulating effect has been previously reported in the literature.15,64 Li et al.15,17 reported that NO can be weakly
adsorbed onto transition metal oxides on the catalyst surface (MOx) and then react with surface oxygen (lattice
oxygen and/or chemisorbed oxygen) to produce active species such as
NO+, NO2, and NO3–, which contribute to the removal of Hg0.

3.3.3 Effect of SO2
In order
to understand the effect of SO2 on Hg0 removal
efficiency, four different SO2 concentrations were assessed
in the range of 0–1000 ppm. As depicted in Figure 9c, compared with the condition
of a SO2-free atmosphere, the presence of 300 ppm SO2 in SFG increased the Hg0 removal efficiency from
75.3 to 77.7%. However, a further increase in SO2 concentration
from 300 to 1000 ppm exhibited an obvious inhibition of Hg0 removal efficiency. This could be explained by the competitive adsorption
between SO2 and Hg0 onto the surface of active
sites. In a previously reported study,15 SO2 was found to exhibit stronger adsorption to active
sites on the catalyst surface than Hg0. Therefore, SO2 is preferentially oxidized before Hg0.

3.3.4 Effect of H2O
As an
unavoidable component of coal-fired flue gas, water vapor (H2O) has been reported to greatly affect the activity of metal oxide
catalysts during the removal of Hg0.13,15 As shown in Figure 9d, when the concentration of H2O increased from 0 to 3%,
the existence of H2O exhibited a slight inhibitory effect
on the removal of Hg0. With a further increase in H2O concentrations of 3, 5, and 8%, the average removal efficiency
of Hg0 decreased from 72 to 67 and 65%, respectively. According
to the previously reported literature,15,17 the inhibitory
effect of H2O could be ascribed to the competitive occupancy
of surface active sites, displacing the adsorption of Hg0. In a real flue gas, it also includes the gas components of SO3, NO2, and HCl. The content of the three components
is relatively low compared with the abovementioned O2,
SO2, and NO, but it might also have certain impacts on
the removal of Hg0. Many researchers considered that SO3, NO2, and HCl could enhance the Hg0 removal,70−72 and this will be examined in future work.

3.4 Hg0 Removal Mechanism Discussion
The chemical valence states of elements present on spent ISBM700
were analyzed by XPS for better understanding of the mechanism of
Hg removal by ISBM. Figure 10 shows the Hg 4f, O 1s, and Co 2p XPS spectra of the spent
ISBM700 sample. In comparison to the XPS analysis of fresh ISBM700
(Figure 5 and Table 2), the peaks representing
Co3+ (∼788.85 and ∼780.3 eV), lattice oxygen
(Oβ, ∼530.4 eV), and chemisorbed oxygen (Oα, ∼531.4 eV)15 decreased
by 9.3%, 12.4, and 14.4%, respectively, while those representing molecular
water or adsorbed −OH groups (Oα′,
∼532.8 eV) increased by 26.8%. The Hg 4f XPS spectra are depicted
in Figure 10c. The
peak with a binding energy of 102.1 eV in the spent ISBM700 material
represents the Si 2p electron.66 Moreover,
the binding energy of the Hg 4f peak at 103.8 eV was attributed to
HgO.13,67 These results indicate that chemisorbed
oxygen (Oα) and lattice oxygen (Oβ) were partially consumed in the process of mercury removal, with
CoOx involved in the reaction. The presence
of HgO implied that the adsorbed Hg was oxidized by the surface active
sites of the biochar sample. According to the Mars–Maessen
mechanism,67 Hg0 is first adsorbed
onto the surface active sites of biochar and then the adsorbed Hg0 can be easily oxidized to HgO by the surface oxygen species
(Oα, Oβ, and other oxygen-containing
functional groups, such as C=O and C–O). Subsequently,
the consumed surface oxygen species can be replenished by gas-phase
oxygen.13,15 As discussed above, its mechanism is consistent
with that of many cobalt oxide-modified carbon materials for mercury
removal.11,12 A comparative overview of catalytic activity
of ISBM700 in comparison with other reported catalysts/sorbents for
Hg0 removal is given in Table S1. The comparison between ISBM700 and Co- and other transition metal
element (such as V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Cu)-modified catalysts/adsorbents
shows that the ISBM700 prepared by one-step pyrolysis can also be
utilized for mercury removal and exhibited relatively better performance
than those of Co/FA11 and cobalt sulfide
sorbents.68 The abovementioned analyses
indicate that the CCIB after one-step pyrolysis at an optimal temperature
of 700 °C has relatively higher specific surface area, a quantity
of lattice oxygen derived from well-dispersed amorphous-phase CoOx
and abundant oxygen functional groups, and it can be utilized for
Hg0 removal instead of any chemical modification. This
study has guiding significance for using the biomass which has been
used for phytoremediation of water or soils contaminated by heavy
metals of Co.

4 Conclusions
The cobalt-contaminated ISBM was pyrolyzed at various temperatures,
with analysis of the effect on Hg0 removal efficiency.
The mercury removal test shows that ISBM has the optimum mercury removal
efficiency of 86% when pyrolysis temperature is 700 °C. The existence
of NO and O2 facilitated the removal of Hg0,
while SO2 and water vapor inhibited the removal of mercury
as a result of competitive occupation. Characterization analysis indicated
that ISBM700 has relatively higher specific surface area, abundant
lattice oxygen derived from well-dispersed amorphous-phase CoOx, and oxygen functional groups. When the
pyrolysis temperature increased to 900 °C, the ISBM tend to agglomerate,
resulting in a drastic increase in crystalline-phase particle size,
inhibiting the removal of Hg0. CoOx was not found to occur at less than 500 °C, but increased
at higher pyrolysis temperatures. The BET surface of ISBM is very
poor, and little CoOx is produced when
the pyrolysis temperature is not higher than 500 °C, leading
to the low mercury removal efficiency. Anyhow, the CCIB could be utilized
for Hg0 removal after pyrolysis instead of adding cobalt
by chemical modification, allowing the removal of mercury from coal-fired
flue gas using biomass previously used for phytoremediation. Further
investigation is required to optimize CCIB for the simultaneous removal
of NO and Hg0 from flue gas, which could be significant
for both resource utilization and engineering practices.
