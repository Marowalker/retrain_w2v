For
decades, the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS)
has been used to study biological systems due to its environmentally
sensitive fluorescent nature and propensity to bind to hydrophobic
pockets of proteins. However, the syntheses of ANS and its derivatives
have been low yielding, requiring harsh reaction conditions and long
reaction times. We have developed efficient, mild microwave-assisted
copper(0)-catalyzed Ullmann coupling conditions to synthesize ANS
derivatives with yields of up to 74%. Many of these derivatives have
spectral properties distinct from ANS, including improved and diminished
quantum yields, different absorption and emission maxima, and complete
loss of fluorescence. ANS derivatives with these unique fluorescence
properties are useful tools to study biological systems.

Introduction
(Phenylamino)naphthalenesulfonic
acids have been used as dye intermediates
since the 19th century.1 Later, it was
discovered that compounds like 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid
(ANS; Scheme 1, 3a, R = H) were weakly fluorescent in water but had a much
stronger fluorescence yield in the presence of less polar solvents
and proteins with hydrophobic binding pockets.2 ANS binds to proteins nonspecifically by anchoring to cationic side
chains of proteins via its sulfonate moiety and additionally binding
to nearby hydrophobic pockets on the protein via its anilinonaphthalene
core.3 The ability of ANS to bind hydrophobic
pockets of proteins in this nonspecific manner has made it useful
to study the properties of many biological systems. For example, ANS
has been used to study proteins such as serum albumin,4 apomyoglobin,5 histone,6 and alcohol dehydrogenase.7 In conjunction with an increased fluorescence yield, less
polar environments also cause a stark blue shift in the maximum emission
wavelength of ANS.8,9 The hypsochromic emission is due
to a dramatically decreased Stoke shift in the nonpolar environment
around polar, solvatochromic dyes.9 The
spectral properties of ANS and its derivatives have made these fluorophores
useful for studying protein binding,10 the
protein “polarity” in enzymatic binding sites,8 and action potentials in neuronal systems.11 Recently, these fluorophores have been useful
in studying protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer’s and prion diseases.12,13

Scheme 1 Approaches to Synthesize
ANS
Despite the utility of ANS
and its derivatives to study important
biological systems, the synthesis of these molecules has been challenging.
Two approaches developed in previous decades (Scheme 1) use sulfuric acid or aluminum trichloride
as a catalyst at temperatures above 155 °C for longer than 10
h.14−16 These approaches suffer from poor yields (less than 5%) and complicated
product isolation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient
approach for synthesizing ANS and its derivatives. In this work, we
have used Ullmann coupling to develop a method for the synthesis of
these compounds with improved yields and shorter reaction times. Ullmann
coupling is a well-documented method to form C(aryl)–N bonds,
like the one found in ANS.17 This reaction
has been used to synthesize 4-anilino-substituted anthraquinone derivatives,
similar to ANS in its tolerance of the sulfonate group.18−20 Upon synthesis, we subsequently characterized the fluorescence properties
of our ANS derivatives.

Results and Discussion
We initially
investigated two Ullman coupling conditions previously
reported for anthraquinone derivatives (see Supporting Information).18−22 Method A, which used elemental Cu as the catalyst and aqueous NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 solutions
as the solvent, provided ANS (3a) in 45% yield. No product
was obtained from method B, which involved CuI and tetramethylethylenediamine
(TMEDA). Therefore, we optimized the Ullmann coupling conditions from
Method A for the synthesis of ANS by screening copper catalysts, temperature,
the amount of aniline, and reaction times. We screened copper catalysts
CuI, CuCl, and Cu0, whereby Cu0 provided the
best yield. Exploring a temperature range from 80 to 120 °C showed
that 100 °C provided the best yield under microwave conditions.
Investigation of the amount of aniline and reaction time indicated
that 1.1 equiv of aniline and 1.5 h reaction time provided the best
yield, with no benefit observed with more aniline or longer reaction
times. The best reaction conditions combined 8-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonic
acid (1, 0.41 mmol, 1 equiv) with aniline (2a, 0.46 mmol, 1.1 equiv) in the presence of a catalytic amount of
elemental copper (10 mol %). In 5 mL of aqueous sodium phosphate buffer
of pH 6–7, the reaction mixture was stirred and microwaved
for 1 h at 100 °C providing NAS (3a) in 63% yield.
In order to investigate the application and tolerance to functional
groups of this method, we next synthesized ANS derivatives with various
aryl substitutions (Table 1). Substrates with different halides on the benzene ring (3b–3h) resulted in good to excellent yields
(42–67%). Not surprisingly, substrates with electron-donating
groups such as methyl, methoxy, and acetylamino (3i, 3j, and 3o) gave the best yields of 69, 74, and 60%, respectively.
Derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups, including nitrile and
nitro, resulted in lower yields (3l–3m, 11–25%). Notably, tolerance of hydroxyl groups was observed
(3k, 21%) in this reaction. The major side product of
this approach is 8-hydroxynaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid caused by using
water as a solvent, which is displacing the 8-chloro group.

The fluorescence properties of the synthesized ANS derivatives
were analyzed. In particular, the maximum absorbance and emission
wavelengths (λ) were recorded as well as the quantum yields
(φ) in both water and the less polar solvent ethylene glycol,
as reported in Table 2. Examples of absorbance and emission spectra are shown in Figure 1 for 3f (the remaining absorbance and emission spectra can be found in the Supporting Information). Many ANS derivatives
have been synthesized and characterized previously; our data closely
matches what has been reported earlier.16 As observed prior, less polar solvents resolve an absorbance spectrum
with characteristic dual peaks, whereas in water, a single peak is
observed. The maximum absorbance wavelength in ethylene glycol was
recorded as the maximum of this second peak, as that peak confers
maximal fluorescence for these compounds. All measurements were normalized
to what has been reported and likewise observed in this study for
the parent compound ANS, as is further described in the Experimental Section.

After much study and debate about the structural and
energetic
nature of ANS fluorescence, the model proposed by Kosower and Kanety
has prevailed (Figure 2).16 In this model, the naphthalene and
phenyl rings of ANS are noncoplanar (np) in the ground state (S0,np). Light excites an electron in the naphthalene ring without
a significant change in configuration (S1,np). In less
polar environments like ethylene glycol, a radiative pathway prevails
over an alternative electron-transfer process that creates a conformationally
different charged-transfer (ct) state between the two ring systems
(S1,ct), which is stabilized in more polar environments
such as in water. In polar environments, the S1,ct state
can either nonradiatively relax to the ground state S0,np via another electron-transfer process or can emit light. In polar
solvents, it has been well established that this nonradiative process
is much faster than the radiative process, causing quenching of fluorescence
signal.23 Both solvents examined in this
study, ethylene glycol and water, are relatively polar, allowing for
rapid dissolution of the sodium salt ANS derivatives. However, notably,
ethylene glycol is less polar and more viscous. Previous examination
of ANS fluorescence in ethylene glycol and glycerol, solvents with
similar polarities but substantially different viscosities, has demonstrated
that while viscosity can somewhat influence the fluorescence properties
of ANS and its derivatives, the polarity of the solvent is a more
important determinant of these properties.16

Figure 2 Mechanism
of fluorescence for ANS and ANS derivatives.

An enhancing factor was calculated, or the relative increase in
fluorescence yield of the fluorophore upon change from a polar to
less polar environment. This ideally correlates with the sensitivity
range of the probe, or what difference in signal is expected if it
were applied to a biological system. Four fluorophores (3i,
3j, 3k, and 3o) had an immeasurable
fluorescence signal in aqueous environments that an enhancing factor
could not be calculated. Such immeasurable fluorescence signals have
been observed with similar ANS derivatives before.24 Likewise, the fluorescence yields of these fluorophores
were low even in ethylene glycol. The electron-donating substituent
on all of these four derivatives likely better stabilized the S1,ct state and promotes the nonradiative relaxation pathway.
One derivative, 3b (R1 = R2 = H,
R3 = F), showed a slightly stronger enhancement in fluorescence
than ANS when it transitioned from a polar to less polar environment.
Four other derivatives (3c, 3d, 3e, and 3g) had a better fluorescence yield in ethylene
glycol than ANS but additionally stronger background fluorescence
in water. These four derivatives had electron-withdrawing halogen
groups on the phenyl ring, which might not have stabilized the S1,ct state as well, pushing the equilibrium toward the S1,np state and radiative relaxation. Since ANS binds nonspecifically
to hydrophobic pockets of proteins and only minor structural changes
were made to these derivatives, these ANS derivatives might be better
alternatives for those studying biological systems who want a more
sensitive fluorescence probe or larger fluorescence signal upon binding
to less polar local environments.

For many derivatives, the
large blue shift of ANS upon exposure
to a less polar environment is an attractive quality, as it further
signifies a change in the chemical environment of the fluorophore.
The derivatives synthesized in this study had a wide range of maximum
absorption wavelengths in both water and ethylene glycol, from 310
to 380 nm. Likewise, there was an even wider range of maximum emission
wavelengths in these media, from 454 to 562 nm. The energy corresponding
to the maximum emission wavelength in ethylene glycol roughly corresponds
to the Hammett substituent constant (see Supporting Information).25 This trend has been
observed for ANS derivatives previously.16 The fluorescence yield, maximum emission wavelength, and enhancing
factor are influenced by both the electronic nature of the aryl substituent
and the local solvated environment. This gives biologists a new toolkit
of fluorophores to use instead of ANS if different wavelengths are
desired for either absorption or emission.

Lastly, one derivative, 3m (R1 = R2 = H, R3 = NO2) was not fluorescent
in either solvent and had a much higher maximum absorption wavelength.
Additionally, fluorescence emission was not observed up to 650 nm.
These distinct properties likely arise from a significant resonance
state where the electrons on lone pairs on the aniline nitrogen is
conjugated with the electrons on the para nitro group, causing a substantially
longer absorption wavelength and better stabilization of the S1,ct state by favoring a planar conformation. The conjugated
nature of this derivative could give different excited states and/or
relaxation pathways. While 3m absorbs energy, its inability
to emit light via fluorescence makes it a suitable dummy probe for
situations where fluorescence interference is a concern. The compound
should still bind proteins, but not fluoresce.

Conclusion
ANS
remains a useful fluorophore for studying biological systems.
Traditionally, ANS derivatives with different spectral properties
have been difficult to synthesize in high yields or under mild conditions.
We have developed an efficient Ullmann coupling reaction for synthesizing
ANS derivatives. This Ullmann coupling is unique in that it utilizes
a chloride substituent instead of a bromide or iodide as the halide
and is an example of a ligand-free Ullmann coupling. Additionally,
our method adds to the literature of Ullmann coupling that tolerate
a sulfonic acid moiety on the reactant; the sulfonic acid is a functional
group usually synthesized last in a synthetic pathway as oxidation
of a thiol group. Aside from the new application of the Ullmann coupling
to the synthesis of these compounds, the ANS derivatives prepared
in this study have a range of spectral properties distinct from ANS.
These differences include improved and diminished quantum yields,
different absorption and emission maxima, as well as compound 3m that does not fluoresce under conditions typical for ANS
derivatives. Our method has allowed the incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing
groups, such as the nitro group in 3m, whereas before,
low yields have prevented the synthesis and analysis of such compounds.
It is our hope that these new fluorophores provide biochemists with
an expanded toolkit to better probe the most pertinent biological
questions of today.

Experimental Section
General Materials and Methods
ANS derivatives were
synthesized by the following procedure. 8-Chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonic
acid (0.41 mmol, 1 equiv) and the substituted amine (0.46 mmol, 1.1
equiv) were placed into a 5 mL microwave reaction vial equipped with
a magnetic stirring bar. A buffer solution of Na2HPO4 (pH 9.6, 4.5 mL) and NaH2PO4 (pH 4.2,
0.5 mL) was added to adjust the pH to 6.0–7.0 followed by the
addition of a catalytic amount powdered elemental copper (10 mol %).
The mixture was capped and microwaved (100 W) for 1–3 h at
100 °C. The products were purified by the following procedure.
The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to above 12 by NaOH (5
M) followed by filtration to remove the elemental copper. Water (50
mL) was added to wash the filter residue. The aqueous layer was extracted
with dichloromethane (40 mL, three times) to remove unreacted amine.
Then, the aqueous layer was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue
was dissolved in methanol (30 mL) followed by filtration to remove
undissolved salts. The filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation,
and the residue was subsequently purified by flash column chromatography
using the reusable RediSep Rf Gold C18Aq column from Teledyne Isco
(15.5 g and 30 mL/min flow rate) with MeOH/H2O (4:6). The
average retention time of the products is 30 min. All purified products
were yellow solids and had melting points of >300 °C.

Fluorescence Testing Procedures
Using a BMG ClarioStar
multimode fluorescence, luminescence, and absorbance plate reader
and Corning 3882 plates, the fluorescence properties of ANS and its
derivatives were evaluated. Each compound was evaluated in 100 μL
volume at 100 μM concentration in both water and ethylene glycol.
For each compound, a full absorbance spectrum was measured after blanking
with the appropriate solvent from 310 to 600 nm. Likewise, maximum
emission wavelengths were measured from 400 to 650 nm, except for 3m, which was observed from 450 to 650 nm due to a high maximum
absorption wavelength. The centers of the most major peaks were taken
as the maximum wavelengths for both absorption and emission; a few
compounds had minor peaks in the ranges detected. Fluorescence emission
was measured by exciting at an optimized gain of 2098 at the maximum
absorption wavelength. Because of instrument limitations, some compounds
with low wavelength absorption wavelengths were excited at 320 nm.
In addition, some of these same compounds had overlapping peaks from
the absorption in the UV region, making it difficult to precisely
determine the absorption maxima in these cases. These changes are
noted in Table 2. Compounds
with high fluorescence yields in ethylene glycol, particularly 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, 3g, and 3l, had to be excited with a gain of
1049 so their emission spectra could be recorded within the instrument
parameters.

As a positive control, the properties of ANS (3a) were evaluated. The maximum absorbance wavelengths of
ANS matched well with what was previously reported in both water and
ethylene glycol.16 The maximum emission
wavelength of ANS matches well in ethylene glycol and is in between
two reported values for the maximum emission wavelength in water.16,26 Fluorescence yields were normalized to previously reported values
of ANS fluorescence yields, which matched well with what had been
observed in water and ethylene glycol.16 For each gain used on the instrument, a conversion constant was
calculated to correlate the amplitudes observed in the absorption
spectra to the amplitudes observed in the emission spectra. An enhancement
factor for each compound was calculated as a ratio of the fluorescence
yield in ethylene glycol to the fluorescence yield in water.
