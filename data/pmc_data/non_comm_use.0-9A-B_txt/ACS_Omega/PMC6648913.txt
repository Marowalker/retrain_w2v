Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is
an effective new antimicrobial
approach that is gaining increasing attention and has a wide range
of potential applications in biomedical fields. Among all of the bactericidal
factors generated by CAP, the synergy of reactive nitrogen species
(RNS) and reactive oxygen species is generally considered as the main
reason for its high bactericidal efficiency. However, the produced
RNS (such as nitrite) may also pose potential risks to human health.
Therefore, it is of significance to keep the high disinfection efficiency
of CAP but with producing no or little harmful RNS. In this study,
we investigated whether it is possible to improve the disinfection
efficiency of CAP without producing the harmful RNS by adding a certain
amount of inert halogen salt such as potassium iodide (KI). We found
that the inactivation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria
by helium atmospheric pressure plasma jet (He-APPJ), one form of CAP,
is enhanced consistently in the presence of a certain amount of KI.
The mechanism of action is due to the fact that the He-APPJ-generated
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidizes the iodide
anion to triiodide (I3–), which contributes
to the major bactericidal activity. We believe that the results in
this work can be highly relevant to the practical application of plasma
for disinfection in the biomedical field.

1 Introduction
The
rapid development of bacterial resistance against traditional
antibiotics has led to the urgency to search for novel and efficient
antimicrobial methodologies with which microbes are unable to develop
resistance. In a review paper written by a group of 28 scientists
from both academic and industrial backgrounds, the authors encouraged
the “investigation of nonantibiotic approaches for the prevention
of and protection against infectious diseases”.1 In this regard, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has come
into the spotlight as a new alternative approach for nonsystemic infection
as it shows effectiveness in inactivating a range of microorganisms,
including antibiotic-resistant biofilm-forming strains and spores,2 and in reduction of bacterial load in chronic
wounds.3,4

CAP refers to a partially ionized
gas generated by electrical discharges,
whose temperature is close to room temperature. During discharge,
various types of plasma-chemical reactions are initiated and a number
of physical and chemical bactericidal factors are produced, including
electrons, ions, neutrals (fundamental and excited states), reactive
oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), UV light, electrical field, and
so on.5 Among all of the active factors,
the produced ROS/RNS have gained increasing attention because they
can be dissolved into the liquid and initiate various chemical and
biological effects.6−8 Increasingly more pieces of evidence have proved
that the generated ROS and RNS are major factors for the antimicrobial
effects of CAP.8−11

Among various reactive species produced by CAP, hydroxyl radical,
singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), etc. are the main ROS generally considered to play
the dominant role in the bacterial lethal effects in the CAP systems.12−14 RNS such as nitric oxide and its derivatives, including nitrite,
nitrate, and peroxynitrite, can contribute crucially to the CAP-induced
inactivation processes. Indeed, increasingly more works have suggested
that the bactericidal effects of CAP are not simply ascribed to the
ROS or RNS alone but to the complex synergy of both. For example,
our laboratory and other groups have proved that during nitrogen–oxygen
mixture plasma treatment, the generated nitrite can react with the
generated H2O2 to form peroxynitrite/peroxynitrous
acids, which are strong oxidizing RNS and can inactivate planktonic
bacteria, and the production of nitrite and other RNS during plasma
treatment results in the drop of pH in the plasma-treated solution,
which is also critical for the reaction of H2O2 with nitrite.15,16 Ikawa et al. also found that
the CAP applied to the surface of an aqueous solution only showed
bactericidal effects to the bacteria suspended in the solution when
the solution was sufficiently acidic (pH < 4.7), and if the pH
was above 4.7, the bacteria were hardly affected by the CAP application.
They thought the reason for this phenomenon is that in acidic medium,
the generated superoxide anion radicals are converted to hydroperoxyl
radicals, which can penetrate the cell membrane and damage the intercellular
components.17 Therefore, the RNS with pH
decrease may play a significant, perhaps even central, role in CAP-induced
bacterial inactivation processes.

Although the plasma-generated
ROS and RNS exhibited several potential
beneficial applications, they could have damaging effects on the biological
systems, especially the latter. As will be illustrated later, the
concentration of hydrogen peroxide in 1 mL of plasma-treated water,
the main long-lived ROS produced by plasma, is several to dozens of
micromolars even after treatment for 2 min, significantly lower than
the concentration used at home (3–9%).18 However, nitrate and nitrite, the main long-lived RNS species produced
by plasma, are precursors of endogenously formed N-nitroso compounds, most of which are potent animal carcinogens.19 Food frequency questionnaire-based median nitrate
intakes were 68.9 and 74.1 mg per day and the nitrite intakes were
1.3 and 1.0 mg per day in men and women, respectively.20 In 1 mL of water after air plasma treatment
for 1 min, the produced nitrate and nitrite are about 80 and 120 μM
(equal to 5 and 5.6 mg), respectively,15 exceeding the recommended intake value of nitrite as mentioned above.
Using other gases (such as helium, argon, and oxygen), except nitrogen
and air, as the plasma working gas can rule out or diminish RNS production,
but this also weakens the disinfection capability of CAP. Therefore,
a selective method for potentiation of the antimicrobial activity
of CAP without or with diminishing production of harmful chemicals
is required for practical applications of plasma. This is important
not only for the treatment efficiency but also for the potential risks
associated with the direct plasma action on human chronic wounds.

In one of our latest research works, we found that the chloride
anion can selectively potentiate the bacterial killing induced by
corona discharge plasma with oxygen as the working gas. However, a
high concentration of chloride anion (as high as 100 mM) is required,
and its working mechanisms are very complex.21 In this work, we tried another halogen anion, namely, iodide (I–), at low concentration (e.g., 10 μM) in the
application of helium atmospheric pressure plasma jet (He-APPJ) for
achieving the potentiation effect. He-APPJ is a typical CAP, which
has only the high-voltage (HV) electrode. The discharge is generated
between the HV electrode and the surrounding atmosphere, and the generated
plasma can reach the treated sample with the flow of injected helium.22 Helium gas can provide a homogeneous plasma
at room temperature, thus will not cause any thermal damage to the
objects to which it works on. Therefore, it is the preference used
to treat living objects, such as the chronic wounds in humans. A disadvantage
of He-APPJ is that it only produces ROS but no or little RNS, so its
disinfection capability is normally not high enough. Herein, with
addition of 10 μM potassium iodide (KI), we found that the killing
of pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative), Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), was clearly potentiated under He-APPJ treatment.
The underlying mechanisms were also investigated, and for this purpose,
we compared the inactivation behaviors of bacteria induced by plasma-activated
water (PAW) and plasma-activated KI (PAI), and by PAW in the absence
or presence of KI. PAW is a product resulting from a cascade of chemical
reactions between plasma-generated active particles and water molecules,
which is with the presence of a rich diversity of long-lived ROS and
RNS, such as hydrogen peroxide, nitrite, nitrate, and so on.23 From the comparisons, we confirmed that the
long-lived ROS generated by He-APPJ oxidized I– to
active iodine, which can inactivate the bacteria efficiently. Furthermore,
we also tried to determine which long-lived ROS was mainly responsible
for the I– oxidation and which types of active iodine
were produced. We believe that this work may be helpful for practical
applications of He-APPJ for disinfection in the biomedical field.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 KI Potentiates the He-APPJ-Induced
Killing
of Planktonic Bacteria
KI is a nontoxic inorganic salt and
has been used in medicine for over a century. It is still a good candidate
for the therapy of several dermatoses as a drug of first or second
choice.24 Even applying KI with dose at
2.8–3.5 g per day to the area infected with sporotrichosis
in adult never causes serious adverse events.25 Herein, our initial experiments involved the comparison of the killing
of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in the absence or
presence of KI. We added different concentrations of KI into P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus suspensions and then
the suspensions were exposed to He-APPJ treatment for 20 s. The initial
densities of all of the three bacteria were approximately 107 CFU mL–1. After treatment, the samples were diluted
104 times with water and then examined with colony-forming
unit (CFU) measurements. Figure 1a shows the results of the survival fraction of the
three bacteria with additions of increasing concentrations of KI.
Regardless of the bacterial strains, we observed a pronounced increase
in bacterial killing with addition of certain amount of KI. For example,
in the absence of KI, the survival ratio of P. aeruginosa after He-APPJ treatment for 20 s was 94.8%, while with addition
of 1 μM KI, it was 77.9%. With further increasing the KI concentration
to 100 μM and 10 mM, the survival ratio was 60.7% and 0, respectively.
A similar potentiation effect was also observed for E. coli and S. aureus. Addition of 10 μM KI into the bacterial suspension increased
the inactivation ratio from 1.1 to 21.3% for E. coli and from 33.9 to 73.8% for S. aureus. When the added KI reached 1 mM, both E. coli and S. aureus were completely killed
after treatment for the same time. To illustrate the potentiation
effect of KI, the photographs of CFU measurements of E. coli without or with different concentrations
of KI after He-APPJ treatment are shown in Figure S1. Considering the possible toxicity of KI, we added different
concentrations of KI in bacterial suspension and found that even 100
mM KI could not induce any bacterial death at all (see Figure S2). This result is consistent with other
researchers’ report, in which the authors showed that even
100 mM KI had no toxic effects on bacterial viability.26

Figure 1 (a) Effect of KI at different concentrations on He-APPJ-induced
inactivation of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The treatment time was 20 s. (b) Dependence of the inactivation
of P. aeruginosa, E.
coli, and S. aureus in the absence or presence of 100 μM KI by He-APPJ on the
treatment time. The initial bacterial density for plasma treatment
was at about 107 CFU mL–1. Each experiment
was repeated three times. Error bars indicate ±SD obtained from
the average calculation of three experimental data.

Moreover, to further verify the potentiation effect
of KI, 100
μM KI (final concentration) was added to P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus suspensions, and then the bacterial samples were exposed to He-APPJ
treatment for increasing time (from 20 to 60 s). After treatment,
the suspensions were also diluted and CFU measurements were performed
as described above. The survival ratio of the three bacteria in the
presence of 100 μM KI after treatment for different times were
compared to that in the absence of KI (Figure 1b). For both P. aeruginosa and E. coli, the potentiation effect
of KI on the plasma-induced bacterial killing was increasingly pronounced
with increasing treatment time. For example, the survival ratios for P. aeruginosa and E. coli without KI after He-APPJ treatment for 20 s were 85.1 and 82.2%,
which decreased to 43.8 and 77.1% after treatment for 60 s, respectively.
However, in the presence of 100 μM KI, the survival ratios of P. aeruginosa and E. coli after He-APPJ treatment for 20 s were 78.5 and 53.8%, which decreased
to 3.9 and 0% after treatment for 60 s, respectively. For S. aureus, which was more susceptible to the He-APPJ
than P. aeruginosa and E. coli, the potentiation effect of KI on its killing
was more pronounced with 20 s plasma exposure. Its survival ratios
in the absence or presence of 100 μM KI after plasma treatment
for 20, 40, and 60 s were 37.8, 12.7, and 2.9% and 21.3 0.1, and 0%,
respectively. All of these results suggest that KI can greatly potentiate
the He-APPJ killing of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic
bacteria with density at 107 CFU mL–1 even at 10 μM. The slight increase of survival of E. coli with KI at 1 μM in Figure 1a is probably due to that the
salt (KI) provides normal conditions for bacterial survival, such
as ionic strength or osmotic pressure. The nonmonotonous decrease
of survival of E. coli in Figure 1b is most probably
due to that the bacterial suspension without salt caused large errors
of the experimental data.

2.2 Bacterial Inactivation
Induced by PAW and
PAI
In one of our latest reports, we found that chloride
could potentiate the bacterial killing induced by corona discharge
plasma in oxygen, and the reason for the potentiation effect was due
to that the chloride is oxidized to active chlorine by plasma-produced
hydroxyl radicals.21 We speculate that
the enhancement effect of KI on bacterial killing was due to the oxidation
of I– by He-APPJ to form active iodine species.
To confirm this hypothesis, disinfection capabilities of PAW and PAI
with different initial KI concentrations were compared, and the result
is shown in Figure 2. If the oxidation of I– by He-APPJ is responsible
for the potentiation effect of KI on bacterial killing shown in Figure 1, PAI should have
stronger disinfection capability than PAW. For all of the three bacterial
strains, PAI showed really stronger disinfection capability than PAW,
which represented a KI-concentration-dependent manner. As the initial
concentration of KI increased, higher bacterial reduction was achieved
by PAI exposure. For both P. aeruginosa and E. coli, the disinfection efficiency
of PAW was nearly negligible, which was only 5.6% for both strains.
While when the initial KI concentration reached 100 μM, the
PAI showed clearly stronger disinfection capability than PAW, which
inactivated 51.2% P. aeruginosa and
63.2% E. coli, respectively. With further
increasing the initial KI concentration to 1 mM, the PAI could inactivate
almost 100% P. aeruginosa and E. coli. For S. aureus, PAW showed modest sterilization capability, which inactivated 49.2%
bacteria. PAI-1 mM and PAI-10 mM showed stronger sterilization capability,
which inactivated 77.7 and 99.9% bacteria, respectively. The slight
increase of survival of E. coli after
PAI-1 μM and PAI-10 μM treatment is probably due to that
the salt (KI) in it provides certain ionic strength or osmotic pressure,
which are beneficial to the bacteria survival. For excluding the possible
role of increase of conductivity of solution with addition of KI,
we compared the bacterial inactivation by He-APPJ in the presence
of KCl, KBr, and KI at different concentrations. Although all of the
three salts have potentiation effects at certain concentration, their
capabilities are different, especially at 1 or 10 mM. KI has the strongest
potentiation effect, followed by KBr and then KCl (Figure S3). If the potentiation effect is due to the increase
of conductivity of solution, the potentiation would be the same for
the three salts at the same concentration, and also the PAI should
not have stronger disinfection capability than PAW.

Figure 2 Inactivation of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus by PAW and PAI. The
He-APPJ treatment time of PAW and PAI was 20
s. The bacterial density for PAW and PAI exposure was at about 107 CFU mL–1. Each experiment was repeated
three times. Error bars indicate ±SD obtained from the average
calculation of three experimental data.

Indeed, several previous studies have shown that PAW has
a notable
broad-spectrum biocidal activity against bacteria,23,27,28 fungus,29 and
biofilms.30 The ROS and RNS in PAW, or
their synergy, play a crucial role in its biocidal activity, which
results in a high oxidation–reduction potential and low pH
value. Some research works have shown that the synergy of nitrite
and H2O2 in acidified medium in PAW can form
peroxynitrite, which is a strong oxidant and plays a crucial role
in the disinfection ability of PAW.23,31 In this work,
the nozzle of the plasma device was inserted into the well of the
24-well plate, and so the plasma was generated in an airtight environment.
This way prevented the incorporation of air into the helium and also
inhibited the nitrite production and pH decrease in the solution.
In addition, the plasma treatment time for PAW and PAI was really
short (20 s). Therefore, the PAW exhibited extremely weak disinfection
capability.

2.3 Bacterial Inactivation
Induced by PAW in the
Presence of KI
When a plasma jet directly interacts with
the surface of the liquid medium, both long-lived species (H2O2, ozone, nitrite, nitrate, etc.) and short-lived radicals
(hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrated electron, etc.) are
produced.11 For direct plasma treatment,
both short-lived reactive species (such as hydroxyl radicals, superoxide
anions, etc.) and long-lived species (H2O2)
can oxidize I–. However, for PAW, only the long-lived
species can oxidize I– because the lifetime of short-lived
radicals is very short (ns to μs).11 To elucidate which reactive species (short-lived or long-lived)
are responsible for the generation of bactericidal iodine species
during He-APPJ treatment, PAW was mixed with certain amount of KI
solution, followed by addition with bacterial suspension. If the presence
of KI can potentiate the PAW-induced bacterial inactivation, then
the long-lived species generated by He-APPJ oxidize KI to active iodine
species, which further inactivate the bacteria. If not, then the short-lived
radicals are responsible for the KI oxidation. The inactivation behavior
of the three bacterial strains by PAW in the absence or presence of
KI was accounted, and the result is shown in Figure 3. For both P. aeruginosa and E. coli, there is no discrepancy
in the inactivation rate when the KI is in the range of 0–100
μM. When the KI concentration reached 1 mM, 99% P. aeruginosa and 63.1% E. coli were inactivated. When the KI concentration reached 10 mM, the PAW
inactivated almost all E. coli. For S. aureus, KI at 10 mM could effectively potentiate
the PAW-induced bacterial inactivation. The difference of the data
between 0 μM in Figure 3 and PAW in Figure 2 may be due to the difference of initial bacterial density
in different experiments, and it is known that inactivation rate is
dependent on the initial bacterial density.32 These results imply that the long-lived reactive species in PAW,
which itself cannot inactivate the bacteria, can eventually oxidize
the KI to active iodine, which induces bacterial inactivation.

Figure 3 Inactivation
of P. aeruginosa, E.
coli, and S. aureus by PAW in the absence or presence of different concentrations of
KI. The bacterial density for PAW and PAI treatment was at about 107 CFU mL–1. Each experiment was repeated
three times. Error bars indicate ±SD obtained from the average
calculation of three experimental data.

2.4 Oxidation of Iodide by He-APPJ Treatment
Upon oxidation, iodide will be transformed to a series of iodine
species, including HOI, I2, I3–, iodate, etc.33 Iodate is an inert and
nontoxic form of iodine.34,35 Our first thought about
the active iodine species resulting from the KI oxidation by He-APPJ
are I2 and HOI, which are typical disinfectants. To confirm
whether I2 and HOI were produced or not, the mixture of
KI (10 mM) and phenol (0.9 mM) was exposed to He-APPJ treatment for
different times and then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Scavenging of I2 and HOI by phenol was expected
to form iodophenols, which can be identified by HPLC. The HPLC images
of the mixture after treatment for 60–360 s are shown in Figure 4. No matter how long
the treatment took, the generation of iodophenol was not detected.
This result implies that both I2 and HOI are not the active
ingredients responsible for the potentiation effect of KI on the He-APPJ
bacterial killing.

Figure 4 HPLC images of the mixture of KI (10 mM) and phenol (0.9
mM) after
He-APPJ treatment for 60–360 s.

Another active iodine species is I3–, which has been documented to be a broad-spectrum disinfectant half
a century ago by Taylor et al.36 In the
presence of excess I–, the produced I2 can rapidly react with I– with the stoichiometry
of 1:1 to yield stable I3– (k = 6.2 × 109 M–1 s–1).37 To check whether I3– is produced in KI solution after He-APPJ treatment,
KI solution at 10 mM after He-APPJ treatment was measured with UV–vis
absorbance spectroscopy. The result in Figure 5a clearly shows the appearance of the I3– peak, which has two absorption bands centered
at 288 and 353 nm.38 No I3– was detected in KI solution without plasma treatment.
The concentrations of I3– in KI solution
after plasma treatment for different times were calculated with the
extinction coefficient for I3– at 353
nm (Figure 5b). On
increasing treatment time from 20 to 60 s, the yield I3– concentration increased from 3.9 to 15.4 μM,
which increased to 35.5 μM on further increasing the treatment
time to 120 s.

Figure 5 (a) UV–vis absorbance spectra of KI (10 mM) before
and after
He-APPJ treatment for 120 s; (b) concentration of I3– in He-APPJ-treated KI and PAW-treated KI in the absence
or presence of catalase. Error bars indicate ±SD obtained from
the average calculation of three experimental data.

As mentioned above, the long-lived species are
responsible for
the generation of bactericidal active iodine species during He-APPJ
treatment. To further verify this speculation, we compared the I3– generation by direct plasma treatment
to that by PAW. It can be seen from the comparison results (Figure 5b) that there was
no significant difference for I3– formation
between direct He-APPJ treatment group and PAW group. Therefore, we
conclude that the main reactive species responsible for I– oxidation are really long-lived species.

In our experiment,
the airtight environment where plasma generated
prevented the incorporation of air into the helium and also inhibited
the generation of nitrite, nitrate, and ozone. Therefore, the most
possible long-lived species responsible for I– oxidation
is H2O2, which can react with I– to form I3–.39  The H2O2 concentration
in H2O after He-APPJ treatment for 20–120 s was
also measured according to the method in our previous report,40 and the result is shown in Figure S4. Several to dozens of micromolars of H2O2 was generated in 1 mL of water after He-APPJ treatment
for 20–120 s. To verify whether the plasma-generated H2O2 were responsible for I– oxidation,
I3– generation by PAW in the presence
of catalase serving as H2O2 scavenger was also
evaluated (Figure 5b). The presence of catalase completely inhibited the formation of
I3–, implying that the plasma-generated
H2O2 was really the principle species which
oxidized I– to I3– during
the He-APPJ treatment. Furthermore, to confirm that the oxidation
of I– by plasma-generated H2O2 is the reason for the observed potentiation effect of I–, we mixed H2O2 at 7 μM (equal to the
concentration in PAW with 20 s treatment) with different concentrations
of KI (1 μM to 10 mM) and then evaluated the disinfection ability
of the mixture. Consistent with the results in Figure 3, when the final KI concentration was at
1 mM, the mixture exhibited obvious disinfection ability (Figure S5). This result further confirms that
the oxidation of I– to I3– by plasma-generated H2O2 is responsible for
the observed potentiation effect.

Compared with iodine-containing
disinfectants, the advantage of
the combination of He-APPJ and KI provides an “in situ”
and “on-demand” route to production of iodine species
together with ROS, whose synergy exhibits stronger sterilization ability
than the two alone. For example, several studies have proved that
the antimicrobial activity of I2 is enhanced by H2O2.41−43 Indeed, I3– is the polyiodide
ion of I2, which may release I2.44 Additionally, compared to commercial iodine-containing
disinfectants, the concentrations of utilized KI and produced I3– are really low in our case; therefore,
it is mild to the human and may not cause damage to the mammalian
cells. Therefore, we believe that this method may have practical applications
in disinfection of local infection.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, KI can enhance the bactericidal efficiency of He-APPJ
against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria dramatically.
By comparing the inactivation behaviors induced by PAW and PAI, and
by PAW in the absence or presence of KI, we confirmed that the reason
for the potentiation effect is due to active iodine species oxidized
from I–. The reactive substance responsible for
I– oxidation is plasma-generated H2O2, which can oxidize I– to I3– efficiently. The produced I3– is a moderate oxidant which possesses a certain extent of bactericidal
activity. We think that the combination of KI and He-APPJ has the
potential for clinical disinfection applications in the biomedical
field.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Bacterial
Suspension Preparation, He-APPJ
Treatment, and Colony-Forming Units (CFU) Measurements
P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus stock (20 μL)
at −20 °C was inoculated into 100 mL of liquid nutrient
media (P. aeruginosa) or LB media (E. coli and S. aureus) and then incubated at 37 °C overnight with shaking (180 rpm).
After incubation, the bacterial pellet was obtained by centrifugation
(2188g, 5 min) and then suspended in H2O with density at 107 CFU mL–1. The
working bacterial suspension was obtained by mixing 1/10 volume of
H2O or KI solution at certain concentration with 9/10 volume
of bacterial suspension. The final KI concentration in the working
bacterial suspension was from 1 μM to 10 mM. The working suspension
(1 mL) was deposited into the well of 24-well plates and then exposed
to He-APPJ treatment. The plasma jet device was constructed by us,
which had been described previously with minor changes.40 The HV stainless steel electrode with a diameter
of 2 mm is inserted into a ceramic tube with one end closed. The outer
and inner diameters of the ceramic tube are 5 and 3 mm, respectively.
The ceramic tube along with the HV electrode is inserted into a hollow
barrel pipet made of Teflon, which has the diameter of the hollow
barrel about 8 mm, and the diameter of the nozzle is about 3 mm. When
helium with a flow rate of 1 L min–1 is injected
into the hollow barrel and the HV voltage is applied to the HV electrode,
a plasma jet can be generated in front of the end of ceramic tube
reaching the sample surface. The distance between the end of the plasma
jet and the suspension surface was about 1 cm. The output voltage
was about 9.6 kV, and the frequency was 9.5 kHz. After plasma treatment
for certain period, the bacterial suspension was diluted with H2O and then transferred and spread on solid agar plates. After
incubating at 37 °C overnight, CFU were counted and the survival
ratio was calculated.

4.2 Bacterial Inactivation
by PAW or PAI Solution
H2O or KI solution (1 mL)
at different concentrations
(1 μM to 10 mM) was deposited into the well of 24-well plates
and then exposed to He-APPJ treatment for 20 s. The plasma-activated
water and plasma-activated KI with different initial KI concentrations
were defined as PAW, PAI-1 μM, PAI-10 μM, ..., PAI-10
mM, respectively. After treatment, 100 μL bacterial suspension
with density at about 108 CFU mL–1 was
added into the PAW/PAI solutions immediately. The survival ratio of
the bacteria after PAW/PAI treatment for 30 min was calculated from
CFU measurements.

4.3 Bacterial Inactivation
by PAW in the Absence
or Presence of KI
H2O (1 mL) was exposed to He-APPJ
treatment for 20 s and then 10 μL of KI solution was added into
the PAW immediately. The final KI concentration was from 1 μM
to 10 mM. A bacterial suspension (100 μL) with density at about
108 CFU mL–1 was added into the mixture
immediately and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The
survival ratio of the bacteria was calculated from CFU measurements.

4.4 Analytical Methods
Active iodine
species, including I2 and HOI, are powerful disinfectants,
which may be responsible for the potentiation effect of KI on He-APPJ-induced
bacterial killing. For confirming whether I2 and HOI were
generated or not, KI solution in the presence of phenol was exposed
to He-APPJ treatment and then analyzed by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC). KI (100 μL, 100 mM) was added to 900
μL of phenol (1 mM), and then the mixture was exposed to He-APPJ
treatment for certain time. The treated samples were analyzed by HPLC,
which was done on a C18 column with an eluent consisting of 60% water
and 40% acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min–1 and the detection wavelength was at 280 nm. Both I2 and
HOI reacted quickly with phenol to form iodophenols, which was analyzed
quantitatively by HPLC and compared to standard 2-iodophenol, 3-iodophenol,
and 4-iodophenol.45

Triiodide (I3–), which is a moderate oxidant and shows
inferior antibacterial activity compared to I2, may also
be responsible for the potentiation effect of KI. For detecting the
possible generated I3–, KI solution (1
mL, 10 mM) was deposited into 24-well plates and then exposed to He-APPJ
treatment for certain time (20–120 s). After treatment, the
UV absorbance spectra of the sample in the interval 300–750
nm was collected on a UV–vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU UV-2550)
at ambient temperature with quartz cuvettes with 1 mm optical path.
Triiodide shows two strong absorption peaks at 288 and 353 nm,27 and its concentration was determined by applying
Beer–Lambert’s law with the molar excitation coefficient
of 25.5 mM–1 cm–1 at 353 nm.46

For evaluating the oxidation of KI by
PAW, 50 μL of KI solution
at 100 mM was mixed with 450 μL of PAW. The UV absorbance spectra
of the mixture were measured for evaluating the generated I3– concentration.

For evaluating the role
of He-APPJ-generated H2O2 in KI oxidation, 45
μL of catalase (3 mg mL–1) was mixed with
5 μL of KI at 1 M and then added with 450
μL of PAW. The mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm
for 5 min and the UV–vis absorbance spectra of the supernatant
were recorded.
