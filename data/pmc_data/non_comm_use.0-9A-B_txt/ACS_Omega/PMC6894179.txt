Microstructured/nanostructured YVO4:Eu3+ powders
and films were synthesized through a biphasic sol–gel method,
aiming at their application as H2O2 sensing
materials based on the turn-off luminescence of Eu3+ ions.
The synthesis was typically carried out at temperatures of 80 °C
or lower by using organic solutions to dissolve vanadium alkoxide
and aqueous solutions to dissolve yttrium and europium salts together
with sodium carboxylates. The resultant crystalline YVO4:Eu3+ powders and films were characterized as containing
micrometer-sized particles comprising primary nanoparticles with high
specific surface areas. A comparative study was performed on the H2O2-responsive turn-off luminescence properties
for the above samples and those synthesized by a single-phase sol–gel
or a conventional solid-state reaction method. The results indicated
that the microstructural feature of the samples from the biphasic
sol–gel method was effective for detecting H2O2 through its adsorption on the particle surface and quenching
of the Eu3+ luminescence. The film samples showed repeatable
and quantitative turn-off luminescence, thereby demonstrating their
suitability as solid-state H2O2 sensors.

1 Introduction
Fluorescence can be used
for detecting certain kinds of chemical
species. This is based on changes of the fluorescence intensity or
wavelength caused by the interaction between target chemical species
and fluorescent materials. Much effort has been devoted so far to
designing fluorescent materials aiming at biosensing and bioimaging.
Besides traditional organic fluorescent dyes, quantum dots (QDs) have
been intensively studied due to their higher stability and tunable
fluorescence properties. They include semiconductor QDs such as CdS
and CdSe, carbon dots, graphene QDs, and so on.1−3 There have also
been inorganic phosphors that can be used as solid-state luminescence
sensors. Due to their higher mechanical strength, thermal stability,
and chemical durability, inorganic phosphors are suitable for application
under severe circumstances such as high mechanical loads,4 high temperatures,5 or highly reactive conditions.6

A key technique for realizing solid-state luminescence sensors
is the precise control of the microstructure of inorganic phosphors
in accordance with the respective sensing principles: dense bulks
for stress sensing, thin films for high-temperature sensing, and nanoparticles
for chemical sensing.4−6 In our previous studies, we focused on the luminescence
sensing of redox species using rare-earth-activated phosphors (CePO4:Tb3+, CeO2:Sm3+, and CaWO4:Eu3+) synthesized as nanorods,7 porous microspheres,8−10 or nanostructured films.11 In the present study, motivated by the increasing
demand for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),12,13 we attempted to synthesize microstructure-controlled
YVO4:Eu3+ phosphors. Among Eu3+-activated,
red-emitting phosphors, YVO4:Eu3+ is known to
show highly efficient emissions because of the presence of the strongly
light-absorbing VO43– units that can
easily transfer excitation energy to the doped Eu3+ ions.14,15 The highly efficient phosphors are favorable for designing sensors
like turn-off type fluorescent probes.16,17 A difficulty
arises, however, when applying the highly efficient phosphors to chemical
sensors; they need to be synthesized as nanometer-scale particles
having large surface areas. Generally, nanometer-scale phosphors are
inferior to their bulk counterparts due to the much increased amount
of surface defects that quench the luminescence considerably.18 This is the specific reason for the necessity
of the precise microstructural control of inorganic phosphors for
chemical sensing applications.

We report herein our strategy
and results for synthesizing micro-/nano-structured
YVO4:Eu3+ materials for H2O2 sensing. Contrary to the previous methods for the synthesis of YVO4:Eu3+ nanomaterials,15,18−23 a biphasic sol–gel method has been employed because it is
beneficial to obtaining microstructure-controlled materials ranging
from nano- to micro-meter scales.24−26 This method is characterized
by immiscible organic–aqueous solutions maintained still at
low temperatures in a reaction container. Metal (M) alkoxides and
metal (M′) salts are initially dissolved in organic and aqueous
solutions, respectively. The alkoxides are hydrolyzed gradually (not
vigorously) at the organic–aqueous interface. The resultant
metal (M) hydroxide species move toward the aqueous phase where they
meet the other metal (M′) ions to form compounds containing
M and M′. Vanadium oxytriethoxide (VO(OC2H5)3) and yttrium/europium chloride (Y/Eu = 0.95:0.05 in
mol) were used in the present study to precipitate YVO4:Eu3+ powders or deposit YVO4:Eu3+ films in the aqueous phase. Both the powders and the films had a
specific microstructure characterized by their large surface areas,
large pore volumes, and high crystallinity. Accordingly, we could
evaluate them as H2O2-sensing materials with
turn-off luminescence of the Eu3+ ions doped in the YVO4 host. The YVO4:Eu3+ films exhibited
quantitative turn-off luminescence against the H2O2 concentration in aqueous solutions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 YVO4:Eu3+ Powders
A comparative study was first performed for the synthesis of YVO4:Eu3+ powder samples by the sol–gel method
with the above-mentioned biphasic system and a simple single-phase
liquid system. A powder precipitated in the biphasic system (named
BP) was initially tinged with yellow, as shown in Figure 1. The BP powder was then washed
with a 1.0 M aqueous NaOH solution under stirring for 5 h as a base
treatment. The color of the resultant powder (BP-BT) was changed to
white during washing. Although the yellow color was lighter for a
powder precipitated in the single-phase system (SP), the same base
treatment was conducted to obtain SP-BT powder (Figure 1).

Figure 1 The appearance of the YVO4:Eu3+ powder samples:
BP and SP are the as-synthesized powders in the biphasic and the single-phase
system, respectively, and BP-BT and SP-BT are the powders after the
base treatment.

Figure 2 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BP, BP-BT, SP, and SP-BT powder
samples. All the peaks appearing in the patterns can be indexed to
the tetragonal YVO4 phase (ICDD 17-0341). Comparing their
peak intensity, the powders obtained from the biphasic system exhibit
higher intensities and are crystallized better than those obtained
from the single-phase system. The crystallite size along the a-axis of (Y,Eu)VO4 is calculated to be 25.0
and 11.6 nm for BP-BT and SP-BT, respectively, from the (200) peak
using Scherrer’s equation.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of the YVO4:Eu3+ powders: BP,
BP-BT, SP, and SP-BT.

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis was carried out
to examine the
origin of the yellow color of the as-precipitated BP and SP samples.
The V/(Y + Eu) ratio was determined to be 2.18 and 1.58 for BT and
ST, respectively. This result indicates that the BP and SP samples
have excess amounts of vanadium against a stoichiometric V/(Y + Eu)
ratio of 1. Because of the lack of any XRD peaks due to a secondary
phase in Figure 2,
the excess vanadium is thought to be present in the samples as a vanadium
oxide gel. On the other hand, the base-treated samples, BP-BT and
SP-BT, had V/(Y + Eu) ratios of 1.16 and 1.06, respectively. The color
of the BP-BT and SP-BT samples was also changed to white by the base
treatment (Figure 1). The yellow colorization is therefore because of the vanadium oxide
gel, which can be removed by washing in an aqueous NaOH solution.
A further experiment was carried out to confirm the presence of the
vanadium oxide gel before the base treatment. That is, the sample
BP was annealed at 800 °C for 4 h in air in expectation of the
crystallization of the amorphous gel. Figure S1 (see Supporting Information) shows a field-emission transmission
electron microscopy (FETEM) image and a selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern of BP after annealing. The SAED pattern can be indexed
to the orthorhombic V2O5 phase (ICDD 41-1426).
This confirms that the excess vanadium exists separately from the
(Y,Eu)VO4 phase in the sample BP.

The precipitation
of the vanadium oxide gel in the samples BP and
SP can be explained as follows. As reported in the literature,27 a large variety of chemical species containing
V5+ ions exist in aqueous solutions depending on their
pH values as well as V5+ concentrations ([V5+]). Any species stable at the respective conditions is defined in
the log[V5+] – pH diagram.27 Among these, V2O5 is the most stable phase
at both a lower pH and a higher log [V5+]. We observed
in the biphasic system that the pH value of the aqueous solution decreased
from 4.5 before the reaction to 3.6 after the reaction for 24 h. This
pH decrease is because of the progress of the hydrolysis of VO(OC2H5)3 and the subsequent formation of
(Y,Eu)VO4 through a series of chemical reactions as described
below. 1  

This reaction occurs when VO(OC2H5)3 in the organic phase comes into
contact with water molecules at
the interface of the biphasic system. According to the diagram, VO2(OH)2– is stable at a low log
[V5+] around pH = 4.5 and, therefore, H+ is
released through the hydrolysis. 2  

Then, the VO2(OH)2– ions
react with Y3+ and Eu3+ in the aqueous phase
to form Y1–xEuxVO4. This reaction also releases H+ and
the pH value would be decreased further. However, HCOO– derived from HCOONa, which was added to the aqueous phase, works
as a base and consumes H+ to achieve the following equilibrium
reaction. 3  

Thus, the pH value steadies down to
3.6 after the 24 h reaction.
With the progress of reactions 1 and 2, the stable V5+ species changes from
VO2(OH)2– to less-soluble
V2O5, which has a great tendency to form an
amorphous gel.28

Figure 3 shows the
photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra of the samples
BP, BP-BT, SP, and SP-BT. Several sharp peaks are observed in both
the excitation and the emission spectra. They are characteristic of
the 4f–4f electronic transitions of Eu3+ doped in
the YVO4 phase,29 thereby confirming
that reaction 2 involves Eu3+ as
the reactant in the present liquid-phase synthesis. Strong, broad
excitation bands ranging from 220 to 360 nm are also seen in the PL
excitation spectra of all the samples. They are assigned to the overlapping
VO43– absorption and O2– → Eu3+ charge transfer (CT).30,31

Figure 3 PL
excitation and emission spectra of the four YVO4:Eu3+ powder samples (BP, BP-BT, SP, and SP-BT): an emission wavelength
(λem) of 619.5 nm and an excitation wavelength (λex) of 280 nm were used for measuring the excitation and the
emission spectra, respectively.

Because of the presence of the amorphous V2O5 gel, the PL intensity of BP and SP is much lower
than that of BP-BT
and SP-BT, respectively. According to the literature,32 the V2O5 gel has two absorption bands
centered at 270 and 380 nm. The latter band is the reason for the
yellow colorization and would have less influence on the Eu3+ emissions. In contrast, the former band overlaps with the CT band
and a large part of the excitation light is absorbed by the V2O5 gel in the samples BP and SP. Therefore, the
base treatment of these samples in the 1.0 M aqueous NaOH solution
under stirring for 5 h effectively removes the V2O5 gel and enhances the Eu3+ emissions, as seen for
the samples BP-BT and SP-BT in Figure 3.

It is also obvious in Figure 3 that the samples from the biphasic system
exhibit
a higher PL intensity than those from the single-phase system both
before and after the base treatment. This is one of the major reasons
why we employ the biphasic sol–gel method to produce phosphor
materials. Formerly, we synthesized two kinds of self-activated luminescent
materials, namely CaNb2O6 and Ba2V2O7, by a similar biphasic method.25,26 In the case of CaNb2O6, particles obtained
from the biphasic method had a rough and dimpled surface which was
more suitable for the extraction of the emitted light. Ba2V2O7 from the biphasic method also had better
crystallinity and morphology for emission. A fundamental difference
between the biphasic and the single-phase system lies in the reaction
rate and the morphological evolution. The hydrolysis of the metal
alkoxides proceeds much more slowly and mildly due to a very limited
reaction space as well as a low amount of water at the organic–aqueous
interface. The nucleation and crystal growth of Y1–xEuxVO4, according
to reaction 2, take much more time in the biphasic
system and the precipitates are matured well. This is why the crystallinity
is better (Figure 2) and hence the PL intensity is higher (Figure 3) for the samples from the biphasic system.

The photostability of the samples BP and BP-BT was evaluated because
the nano-sized phosphors synthesized from the chemical solutions containing
organic ligands often suffer from degradation during irradiation with
the excitation light.33,34Figure S2 shows the PL intensity at 619.5 nm plotted against time of the ultraviolet
(UV) irradiation at 320 nm for the samples BP and BP-BT. While the
PL intensity of BP, normalized to its initial intensity, decreases
rapidly to 0.24 within 10 min, BP-BT maintains its intensity as high
as 0.85 after 10 min. We confirmed from the Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy analysis that the HCOO– ions
were present in the sample BP and initially questioned whether they
acted as the luminescence quencher. However, we came to know later
that a film sample also had low photostability even after annealing
at 400 °C for 3 h in air: the photostability was finally improved
after the base treatment. Because the HCOO– ions
were no longer present in the annealed film, we consider that the
low photostability of the sample BP arises from the amorphous V2O5 gel.

Figure 4a shows
the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of
the samples BP-BT and SP-BT. Both the samples are defined as micrometer-sized
spherical particles, which are constructed of primary nanoparticles.
The apparent sizes of these micro-/nano-structured particles are 0.5–3.0
and 0.5–1.5 μm for BP-BT and SP-BT, respectively. Figure 4b shows the FETEM
images of the samples BP-BT and SP-BT. It is observed that both the
samples are formed by the aggregation of non-spherical nanoparticles.
The sample BP-BT exhibits a larger size of the primary nanoparticles
than the sample SP-BT, indicating that the crystal growth was promoted
in the biphasic system. This result also supports the higher PL intensity
of the BP-BT sample as mentioned above.

images of the YVO4:Eu3+ powders after the base
treatment (BP-BT and SP-BT).

Figure 5 shows the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size
distribution curves of BP-BT and SP-BT. The isotherm of both BP-BT
and SP-BT corresponds to that of type IV with a type H2 hysteresis
loop in the IUPAC classification.35 This
suggests that the present YVO4:Eu3+ particles
have mesopores with an ink bottle shape. The fitting analysis based
on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation revealed
that the specific surface areas of BP-BT and SP-BT were 157 and 67.4
m2 g–1, respectively. The pore size distribution
was examined using the MP and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. It is seen from Figure 5b,c that both BP-BT and SP-BT have micropores and mesopores
with diameter ranges of 0.7–2 and 2–10 nm, respectively.
The pore volume is larger in BP-BT than in SP-BT. These results demonstrate
that the micro-/nano-structured particles from the biphasic system
are promising as porous sensing materials.

at 77 K, and (b) BJH and (c) MP pore size distribution curves of the
BP-BT and SP-BT samples.

To examine the H2O2-sensing
ability of our
YVO4:Eu3+ micro-/nano-structured particles,
PL spectra were measured before and after immersing them in a 100
ppm H2O2 solution for 10 min. Figure 6 shows the PL excitation and
emission spectra of the samples BP-BT and SP-BT, together with those
of another powder synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction
method (the sample SS) before and after H2O2 immersion. Note that the sample SS was composed of micrometer-sized
particles and its specific surface area was as low as 0.8 m2 g–1. It is seen from Figure 6 that BP-BT and SP-BT undergo a decrease
of 33 and 18%, respectively, in their PL intensity after immersion
in the 100 ppm H2O2 solution. On the other hand,
the sample SS does not show any remarkable change in the PL intensity
after immersion. This observation indicates that the micro-/nano-structured
particles from the biphasic system have higher H2O2-sensing ability based on the PL quenching because of their
higher specific surface areas and larger pore volumes.

Figure 6 PL excitation and emission
spectra of the YVO4:Eu3+ powders of (a) BP-BT,
(b) SP-BT, and (c) SS before and after
immersing in a 100 ppm aqueous H2O2 solution.

For BP-BT, the PL intensity was also measured using
different amounts
of the powders immersed in the 100 ppm H2O2 solution.
As shown in Figure S3, there seems to be
no systematic trend between the PL intensity and the amount of the
powders. We also confirmed that the PL intensity no longer decreased
with a much larger amount of the powders, basically indicating that
the number of H2O2 molecules was excessive under
the experimental conditions for Figure S3. Considering that the total surface area increases proportionally
with the amount of the powders, the result in Figure S3 indicates that the effective surface area for H2O2 sensing is not constant among the samples. This
can be deduced from the particle morphology shown in Figure 4a; the BP-BT powder is composed
of particles with different sizes from 0.5 to 3.0 μm. The larger
and the smaller particles would have a different H2O2 sensing ability, taking account of the penetration depth
of the solution inside the particles. The regulation of the particle
size and the penetration depth is necessary to evaluate the H2O2 sensitivity more exactly, which is our next
challenge.

2.2 YVO4:Eu3+ Films
For the possible sensing applications, it is favorable that the micro-/nano-structured
particles are fixed on substrates to facilitate their handling. Films
of YVO4:Eu3+ were then deposited on silica glass
substrates from the biphasic system with the addition of HCOONa (film
F) or CH3COONa (film A) in the aqueous phase. Figure 7 shows XRD patterns
of the films F and A after annealing at 400 °C for 3 h and base
treatment for 1 h. All the peaks appearing in the patterns can be
indexed to the tetragonal YVO4 phase (ICDD 17-0341). The
pattern of film A exhibits a prominent (200) peak as compared to the
other weakened peaks, thereby indicative of a preferential a-axis orientation of the particles grown on the substrate.

Figure 7 XRD patterns
of the YVO4:Eu3+ films obtained
from the biphasic system with the addition of HCOONa (film F) or CH3COONa (film A) in the aqueous phase.

Figure 8 shows FESEM
and FETEM images of the films F and A. From the surface FESEM images
at low magnification, both film F and A consist of micrometer-sized
spherical particles. These particles originate from the initial heterogeneous
nucleation at the substrate surface, the subsequent homogeneous nucleation
in the aqueous phase, and the final growth together on the substrate.
The size of the spherical particles is observed to be 1.0–4.0
and 1.0–2.0 μm for film F and A, respectively. As a whole,
the spherical particles of film A are smaller than those of film F,
and the accumulation of the particles is denser in film A than in
film F. From the surface FESEM images at high magnification in Figure 8a and FETEM images
in Figure 8b, it can
be seen that the micrometer-sized spherical particles are actually
constructed of primary nanoparticles, similar to the YVO4:Eu3+ powder obtained from the biphasic system. The primary
nanoparticles in film F are spherical in shape, whereas those in film
A have a sheet-like structure. From the cross-sectional FESEM images,
the thickness of film A is observed to be larger than that of film
F. This difference would cause changes in the optical properties between
the films. For example, the diffuse reflectance of film A in the visible
light region is twice or many times as high as that of film F, as
shown in Figure S4.

Figure 8 (a) Surface and cross-sectional
FESEM images and (b) FETEM images
of film F and A.

We found that film A was attached more tightly
to the substrate
than film F. This was confirmed experimentally through the repetition
of immersing/heating treatments of the films as described below. As
seen from Figure 8,
the surface of the substrate is fully covered by the densely accumulated
smaller particles in film A, whereas film F exhibits an uncovered
substrate surface due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the particles.
Such a difference may originate from the nucleation stage of the film
deposition. An experiment was then performed to compare the number
of the particles formed on the substrate through the initial heterogeneous
nucleation. That is, the substrate was made to stand against the wall
of a glass centrifuge tube when the films (called film F′ and
A′ in this experiment) were deposited using the biphasic system
under the same reaction conditions. Figure S5 shows the FESEM images of the substrate surface after the reaction.
A clear difference is observed between film F′ and A′
in the number and the size of the particles formed on the substrate.
The larger number and the smaller size of the particles in film A′
coincide with those observed for film A. This is why the connection
between the particles and the substrate, as well as that among the
particles, is sufficiently strong in film A, which is important for
its application as the H2O2 sensor.

The
enhanced heterogeneous nucleation in film A can be explained
as follows. HCOOH and CH3COOH have pKa values of 3.75 and 4.76, respectively. Because the pH value
of the aqueous phase before the reaction was measured to be 4.50,
the concentrations of HCOO– and CH3COO– can be calculated to be 0.085 and 0.024 M, respectively,
according to the formula “pH = pKa + log10([A–]/[HA])” (A = HCOO
or CH3COO). In the aqueous phase, the HCOO– and the CH3COO– anions can react with
the Y3+ (0.095 M) and the Eu3+ cations (0.005
M) to form complexes, which decreases the concentration of the free
Y3+ and Eu3+ cations. Due to the higher HCOO– concentration, reaction 2 is
retarded and the formation of Y1–xEuxVO4 is suppressed in the
deposition of film F. In contrast, the heterogeneous nucleation becomes
more frequent on the substrate in the case of film A because of the
lower CH3COO– concentration.

Figure 9 shows PL
excitation and emission spectra of film F and A, those immersed in
the 100 ppm aqueous H2O2 solution (film F-I
and A-I), and those subsequently heated at 200 °C in air (film
F-H and A-H). Both film F and A exhibit a remarkable decrease in the
PL intensity after immersing in the H2O2 solution
(F-I and A-I). This H2O2 sensitivity corresponds
with that observed for the powder sample (Figure 6). We confirmed here that the PL intensity
did not change when the films were immersed in water. The decreased
PL intensity of the H2O2-treated films is then
recovered by heating in air at 200 °C (F-H and A-H).

Figure 9 PL excitation
and emission spectra of the YVO4:Eu3+ films:
(a) film F, F-I, and F-H and (b) film A, A-I, and
A-H. Film F-I and A-I were immersed in the 100 ppm aqueous H2O2 solution, and film F-H and A-H were subsequently heated
at 200 °C in air. The scale of the vertical axis is the same
for the two graphic charts (a,b).

The H2O2 sensitivity, as
observed in the
decreasing PL intensity, of the micro-/nano-structured YVO4:Eu3+ particles and films may have a different mechanism
than that observed in our previous redox-responsive phosphor materials.7−11 If the PL quenching is because of the surface redox reaction between
H2O2 and YVO4:Eu3+ to
promote the V5+ → V4+ reduction, the
PL intensity can possibly be recovered by the reverse redox reaction
using oxidants. However, the PL intensity was not recovered by the
typical oxidizing treatment of film F-I by immersing in a 100 ppm
KMnO4 aqueous solution for 10 min, as shown in Figure S6. This implies that the H2O2-treated film F-I had not been reduced and therefore
the PL recovery would need different treatments.

The other plausible
cause for the PL quenching is the photocatalytic
activity of YVO4:Eu3+ for decomposing H2O2. It was reported that the YVO4:Eu3+ nanoparticles could decompose methyl orange under UV irradiation.36 The photoexcited electrons and holes are consumed
to decompose the H2O2 molecules that are adsorbed
on the surface of the YVO4:Eu3+ particles. The
energy transfer to the Eu3+ ions is then disturbed and
their emission intensity is diminished. We found this mechanism possible
because the quenched PL in film F-I could be recovered by continuous
irradiation with 300 nm UV light, as shown in Figure 10. An almost linear recovery of the PL intensity
with the irradiation time corresponds to the progress of the decomposition
of H2O2 and the increase in the energy transfer
to the Eu3+ ions. Without the adsorbed H2O2, YVO4:Eu3+ adversely shows a slight
decrease in its PL intensity as seen for film F in Figure 10. The large surface areas
as well as the highly porous structure of the particles would be beneficial
for preserving the H2O2 molecules inside them
during the immersion treatment.

Figure 10 Changes of the PL intensity at λem = 619.5 nm
with the irradiation (λex = 300 nm) time for film
F and F-I.

Reproducible and repeatable H2O2-sensing
ability should be achieved to fabricate a reliable sensor using the
micro-/nano-structured YVO4:Eu3+ films. Figure 11a shows changes
of the relative PL intensity, obtained by integrating emissions between
500 and 750 nm, of film A after repeating five cycles of the immersion
in the 100 ppm aqueous H2O2 solution and heat
treatment at 200 °C. Obviously, film A can show the quenching/recovery
switching behavior without losing the initial PL intensity. This result
also supports the high mechanical strength of film A which is durable
against the above immersion/heating procedure. Actually the diffuse
reflectance spectra of the initial film and the final film after the
five-cycle treatments are almost the same (Figure 11b); the particles constructing the film
were not detached. In contrast, film F had a lower mechanical strength
and was peeled off after the second heat treatment.

Figure 11 (a) Relative PL intensity
(integrating emissions between 500 and
750 nm) of film A after alternately repeating the immersion in the
100 ppm aqueous H2O2 solution and the heating
at 200 °C in air, and (b) diffuse reflectance spectra of film
A and A-H5 after five cycles of the immersion/heating treatment.

Finally, a quantitative H2O2-sensing ability
was evaluated. Four kinds of film A-I were prepared by using aqueous
H2O2 solutions of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm. The
relative PL intensity (integrating emissions between 500 and 750 nm)
of the films was normalized with that of film A taken as unity. Figure 12 shows a plot of
the relative PL intensity against the H2O2 concentration.
The intensity decreases linearly with the increasing H2O2 concentration, thereby indicating the excellent quantitativity
in H2O2 sensing. The linearity also supports
the PL quenching mechanism, which basically depends on the amount
of adsorbed H2O2 molecules, as discussed above.

between 500 and 750 nm) on the H2O2 concentration

3 Conclusions
The micro-/nano-structured
YVO4:Eu3+ powders
and films were synthesized and their H2O2 sensing
ability was evaluated. The PL emission intensity of the Eu3+ ions was decreased when the YVO4:Eu3+ samples
were immersed in a 100 ppm aqueous H2O2 solution
for 10 min at room temperature. The intensity could then be recovered
by heating the samples at 200 °C for 10 min in air. The film
sample showed repeatable PL quenching and recovery at least up to
five cycles, and also quantitative PL quenching against the H2O2 concentration. The mechanism underlying the
PL quenching was suggested to be the consumption of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs by the decomposition of the H2O2 molecules adsorbed on the YVO4:Eu3+ samples. Our results demonstrate that the microstructure-controlled
phosphor materials are promising as solid-state luminescence sensors
for detecting chemical species by effective surface interaction.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Liquid-Phase Synthesis of Powders
The biphasic sol–gel synthesis of the YVO4:Eu3+ powder was carried out as follows. A 1.00 mmol (187 μL)
portion of VO(OC2H5)3 (95.0%, Aldrich)
was dissolved in 10.0 mL of ethanol (99.0%, Amakasu Chemical Industries).
The resultant solution was then added to 90.0 mL of xylene (80.0%,
FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) to obtain a 0.01 M organic
solution. Separately, 4.275 mmol of YCl3·6H2O (99.9%, Wako), 0.225 mmol of EuCl3·6H2O (99.95%, Kanto Chemical), and 4.50 mmol of HCOONa (98.0%, Wako)
were dissolved together in 45.0 mL of deionized water. The above Eu3+ dopant level (5 mol %) had been optimized for yielding the
strongest Eu3+ emissions in a preliminary experiment by
changing it between 1 and 10 mol %. The pH value of the resultant
aqueous solution was adjusted to 4.50 by using HCl (35.0–37.0%,
Wako). A 7.0 mL aliquot of the aqueous solution was placed in a glass
centrifuge tube, into which 7.0 mL of the organic solution was poured
gently. The biphasic organic–aqueous system was thus achieved
and maintained at a constant temperature of 80 °C for 24 h. The
precipitate (BP) formed after 24 h was collected by suction filtration,
washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for a few hours.
The dried powder, tinged with yellow, was further washed with a 1.0
M aqueous NaOH solution under stirring for 5 h as the base treatment.
The color of the powder changed to white during the washing. Finally,
the white powder (BP-BT) was collected again by suction filtration,
washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for a few hours.

For the comparative study, another powder was synthesized in the
simple single-phase liquid system. The aqueous solution employed for
this synthesis was the same as that used in the above biphasic system.
A 7.0 mL aliquot of the aqueous solution was placed in a glass centrifuge
tube. Then, 0.7 mL of the ethanolic VO(OC2H5)3 solution, which had been used to prepare the organic
solution, was poured directly into the aqueous solution. The resultant
solution was kept at 80 °C for 24 h. The precipitate (SP) was
collected by suction filtration, washed with deionized water, and
dried at 60 °C for a few hours. The base treatment was also carried
out in the same way as described above to obtain the SP-BT powder.

4.2 Solid-State Synthesis of Powder
As
the reference sample, the stoichiometric YVO4:Eu3+ powder was synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction
method. Commercial powders of Y2O3 (99.99%,
Wako), Eu2O3 (99.9%, Wako), and V2O5 (99.0%, Wako) were mixed in a molar ratio of Y/Eu/V
= 0.95:0.05:1 using a pestle and mortar with the addition of acetone.
The resultant mixture was dried at room temperature and then heated
at 1200 °C for 6 h in air to obtain the YVO4:Eu3+ powder (SS).

4.3 Liquid-Phase Synthesis of Films
The
substrates employed in the present study were silica glass plates,
12.6 mm × 12.6 mm in dimensions and 1 mm in thickness. The solutions
used for film deposition were almost the same as those used for powder
synthesis in the biphasic system. Additionally, 3.00 mmol of CH3COONa (98.5%, Wako) was also selected as the additive, instead
of 4.50 mmol of HCOONa, in attempting to modify the nucleation process
during the film deposition. The substrate was placed horizontally
at the bottom of the glass centrifuge tube so that the film can be
deposited on its upper side. A 7.0 mL aliquot of the aqueous solution
containing HCOONa or CH3COONa was added to the tube so
that the substrate could be immersed completely. A 7.0 mL aliquot
of the organic VO(OC2H5)3 solution
was then poured into the tube to prepare the biphasic system. The
system was kept at 50 °C for 24 h to promote the film deposition.
Subsequently, the substrate was removed from the tube, followed by
washing with deionized water and drying at room temperature. The film
thus obtained on the substrate was annealed at 400 °C for 3 h
in air. The annealed film underwent the base treatment for 1 h without
stirring, was washed with deionized water, and was finally dried at
room temperature.

4.4 H2O2 Treatment of Powders
and Films
9.0 μL of a 30 wt % aqueous H2O2 solution (Wako) was added to 30 mL of deionized water
to prepare the 100 ppm H2O2 solution. The pH
value of the H2O2 solution was measured to be
5.8–6.1, which was almost the same as that of deionized water.
The powder samples (30 mg of BP-BT, SP-BT, or SS) were added to the
resultant H2O2 solution and kept at room temperature
for 10 min under stirring. The powders were collected by suction filtration,
washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C for a few hours.
The turn-off luminescence of the powders was examined by measuring
the emission spectra before and after the H2O2 treatment.

Separately, the relationship between the turn-off
luminescence and the amount of the powder was investigated for the
samples obtained from the biphasic system. The BP-BT powder samples,
with their amounts varied between 3.4 and 47.3 mg, were added to 10
mL of the 100 ppm H2O2 solution and kept at
room temperature for a prolonged time (1 h) under stirring. The turn-off
luminescence of the collected powders was then examined similarly.

The film samples were immersed in the 100 ppm H2O2 solution for 10 min at room temperature. The films were removed,
washed with deionized water, and dried at room temperature. Additionally,
the films were annealed at 200 °C for 10 min in air in order
to desorb or decompose the H2O2 molecules. The
PL of the films was examined similarly before and after the H2O2 treatment and also after annealing.

For
the quantitative evaluation of the H2O2-sensing
ability, four kinds of film A-I were prepared by using aqueous
H2O2 solutions of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm and
their PL intensity was measured. The experiment was repeated four
times for the respective film samples to deduce the standard deviation.

4.5 Characterization
The crystalline
phases of the samples were identified by XRD analysis (D8 ADVANCE
diffractometer, Bruker AXS) using Cu Kα radiation. The crystallite
size was calculated from the full width at half maximum of the XRD
peak using Scherrer’s equation with a K value
of 0.9.37 The microstructure of the samples
was observed by FETEM (Tecnai F20 microscope, FEI). The specimen for
the FETEM observation was prepared by dispersing the powders in ethanol
and drying on a carbon coated copper grid. The morphology of the samples
was observed by FESEM (Inspect F50, FEI, or S-4700 microscope, Hitachi).
Conductive coating was applied to the samples with an osmium plasma
coater. The chemical composition of the powder samples was examined
by XRF spectroscopy (XGT-2700 analytical microscope, Horiba). The
stoichiometric Y0.95Eu0.05VO4 powder
synthesized by the solid-state reaction method was used as the reference.
The pH value of the aqueous solution was measured at room temperature
with a pH meter (model F-51, Horiba) and a pH electrode (model 9615S-10D,
Horiba). The PL spectra and the photostability of the samples were
measured at room temperature with a spectrofluorophotometer (model
FP-6500, JASCO) using a xenon lamp (150 W) as the light source. The
powder samples were mounted on a silica glass plate having a square
well 5 mm × 5 mm in dimensions to regulate their amount in the
PL measurement. The film samples were measured when they were mounted
directly on the attachment. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the
film samples were measured with a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(model V-670, JASCO) in the wavelength range between 200 and 800 nm.
An integrating sphere (model ISN-723, JASCO) was used together with
a Spectralon diffuse reflectance material. The BET surface area and
the pore size distribution of the powder samples were evaluated by
using nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus (model BELSORP-mini
II, MicrotracBEL). The presence of organic species in the samples
was examined by FT-IR (ALPHA spectrometer, Bruker Optics).
