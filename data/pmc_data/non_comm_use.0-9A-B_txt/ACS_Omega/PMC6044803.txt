Pseudoisocytidine
(ΨC) is a synthetic cytidine
analogue that can target DNA duplex to form parallel triplex at neutral
pH. Pseudoisocytidine has mainly two tautomers, of which only one
is favorable for triplex formation. In this study, we investigated
the effect of sequence on ΨC tautomerization using
λ-dynamics simulation, which takes into account transitions
between states. We also performed in vitro binding experiments with
sequences containing ΨC and furthermore characterized
the structure of the formed triplex using molecular dynamics simulation.
We found that the neighboring methylated or protonated cytidine promotes
the formation of the favorable tautomer, whereas the neighboring thymine
or locked nucleic acid has a poor effect, and consecutive ΨC has a negative influence. The deleterious effect of consecutive ΨC in a triplex formation was confirmed using in vitro
binding experiments. Our findings contribute to improving the design
of ΨC-containing triplex-forming oligonucleotides
directed to target G-rich DNA sequences.

Introduction
The formation of DNA
triple helices plays a key role in cellular
processes1 such as regulation of replication
and transcription,2−5 chromosome folding,6 stabilization of
telomeres, and recombination.7 Triplex-forming
oligonucleotides (TFOs) have been used in many biotechnological and
biomedical applications that make use of their ability to target the
major groove of a DNA duplex. Examples are isolation of specific DNA
sequences (triplex affinity capture),8−10 detection and capture
of polymerase chain reaction products,11 detection of DNA mutation,12 and site-directed
mutagenesis.13,14 Triplexes can form in different
ways: with purine (antiparallel orientation) or pyrimidine (parallel
orientation) motifs.15 In a parallel triplex,
T•A–T and C+•G–C base triads
are formed (“–” refers to a Watson–Crick
base pair and “•” refers to a Hoogsteen base
pair).16

Triple-helix target sites
in the human genome are abundant, especially
in promoter regions.17,18 TFOs targeting G-rich sequences
are of biological importance because such regions are frequently present
in promoters, which are potential targets for regulating transcription
as an antigene strategy.18 However, the
formation of parallel triplexes is not favorable at physiological
pH because it requires the protonation of cytosine (pKa 4.1).19 This limits the therapeutic
application of TFOs as antigene strategy to regulate transcription,
specifically when targeting G-rich sequences.20,21

Pseudoisocytidine (ΨC) is an artificial pyrimidine
analogue that is derived from pseudouridine.22 It has at least two relevant tautomers, ΨC(H1)
and ΨC(H3), corresponding to the presence of a proton
at N1 and N3, respectively (Figure 1). Tautomer ΨC(H1) has the hydrogen
bond donor/acceptor set for the Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding
scheme to guanine, whereas tautomer ΨC(H3) has the
same set of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors as a protonated cytidine,
which is favorable for Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to guanine.23 Tautomer ΨC(H3) is, thus, desirable
in a TFO as a substitute for C to target G-rich sequences forming
a pyrimidine-motif triplex. The substitution of cytidine by analogues
such as ΨC is one strategy to target G-rich sequences
at physiological pH.22,24,25

In this study, we aim to understand
the ways of optimizing the
design of intermolecular TFOs targeting G-rich sequences by using ΨC as a C analogue. To achieve this, we combined molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with in vitro binding experiments. In particular,
we want to understand the effect of the environment (flanking nucleotides
and bound/unbound states) on the tautomerization of ΨC. Experimental investigation of tautomerization is challenging because
of the structural similarity, fast interconversion, and ambient aqueous
condition.26 Alternatively, molecular simulation
methods, primarily λ-dynamics,27 can
be used to describe the change between tautomeric states. MD simulations
have previously been successfully used to investigate DNA triple helices
both in a parallel and an antiparallel fashion.28−30 These studies
show that the DNA double-helix overslides in the negative direction
to increase the major groove and to accommodate the third strand,
and the resultant triple helical conformation is somewhere between
A- and B-types, with base pairs remaining almost perpendicular to
the helical axis.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
was used to detect
in vitro binding of TFOs containing ΨC under intranuclear
conditions. The triplex intercalator, benzoquinoquinoxaline (BQQ),
was used to probe for triplex formation.31,32 Pseudoisocytidines were incorporated both consecutively and nonconsecutively
in the TFO sequence and combined for the first time with sugar-modified
nucleotides, locked nucleic acids (LNAs). LNA has an oxy-methylene
bridge locking the sugar pucker in C3′-endo rather than in
C2′-endo as in DNA, which restricts the conformation of the
sugar. The inclusion of LNAs in TFOs has been shown to increase triplex
stability.33 As a target sequence, we used
an upstream G-rich region of the human trefoil factor (human TFF)
gene close to an estrogen response element (ERE), including runs of
consecutive guanines.34 This sequence was
previously studied using bisLNAs, which contain a C-rich TFO part
and were found to be a poor target at neutral pH.35

First, we discuss the result from λ-dynamics
simulations
for short single-stranded and triplex DNA (trimers and 7-mers) containing ΨC in various positions and sequence contexts. Then,
we compare the observed sequence effect with the result from in vitro
binding experiments of six 17-mer TFOs containing ΨC. Finally, we characterize the structure of the observed triplexes
using classical MD.

Results and Discussion
Pyrimidine
motif triplexes are unstable at physiological pH because
of the need for protonation of C in the third strand. A way to solve
this problem is to use C analogues such as ΨC. Because
the aim of this study is to identify rules on how to incorporate ΨC in LNA containing oligonucleotides (ONs) for optimal
hybridization under intracellular conditions, we started by performing
simulation studies, specifically investigating how the surrounding
bases might influence the tautomerization of ΨC.

Nucleoside
Tautomerization: Reference State
The exact
tautomeric ratio of ΨC in an aqueous solution is
not known. In the crystal structure, the tautomeric ratio ΨC(H1)/ΨC(H3) of the isocytosine base is exactly
1:1.361H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra did not show separate signals for the two ΨC tautomers in the aqueous solution, but enzymatic incorporation
experiments confirmed the existence of the two tautomers in the solution
for the deoxyribonucleoside ΨC.37 The measured pKa1 and pKa2 at the two protonation sites corresponding
to the two tautomeric states are highly similar [pKa1 3.79 and 3.69 and pKa2 9.36
and 9.42, for tautomers ΨC(H1) and ΨC(H3), respectively], and in the same study, ab initio calculation
(Hartree–Fock) for the methylated ΨC base
indicates that tautomer ΨC(H3) is favored over tautomer ΨC(H1) in a vacuum, and less so when the solvent effect
is accounted for using the polarizable continuum model.38

Taking these into account, we decided
to set the tautomeric ratio of the model system, deoxyribonucleoside ΨC, to be 1:1 as the reference, where only the physical
end states were considered. All variations observed in the tautomeric
ratio should be interpreted as relative to the reference and not as
absolute values. Henceforth, we will call this quantity tautomeric
propensity to reflect on this point.

To set the tautomeric ratio
to 1:1 in the λ-dynamics formulation,
we supply a biasing potential exactly equal to the calculated free
energy, ΔGH1→H3, for the model system in water,
28.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol. This results in an average population ratio
of 1:1 for deoxyribonucleoside ΨC. To guarantee an
optimal transition between the two tautomeric states, we calibrate kbias value to yield a high fraction of physical
end states in the trajectory and a high frequency of transitions between
the two tautomeric states. By calibrating with a set of 1 ns λ-dynamics
runs of the model system at various kbias values, we found kbias = 19.5 kcal/mol
to result in >80% physical states and >60 transitions/ns, which
we
judged to be sufficient to ensure good sampling in simulations of
length 1–10 ns (Figure 2). In practice, when this kbias value is applied to other systems containing ΨC,
the transition rate is 40–50 ns–1, and more
than 80% of the population is physical when there is only one ΨC. For two ΨCs, a fraction of 60–70%
is physical, whereas for three ΨCs, 50–60%
is physical. For an illustration of the fluctuation of λ values
at this transition rate and the fraction of physical state, see Figure 3.

Figure 2 Optimization of kbias value. A kbias value of 19.5 kcal/mol (red) is chosen
to maintain the fraction of physical states [fraction physical ligand
(FPL), black] above 0.8, while maintaining a moderately high transition
rate (blue). The error bar is the standard error of the mean of five
independent runs.

Figure 3 Transition of λH1 values in one run each of nucleoside ΨC
(model system used as the reference; henceforth “ref”)
and nucleotide ΨC. Only 0.8 ≤ λH1 ≤ 1 is counted as the physical state of tautomer ΨC(H1), whereas 0 ≤ λH1 ≤
0.2 would be counted as the physical state of tautomer ΨC(H3). The base structures of the corresponding tautomers are shown.
The transition rates are 60 and 40 ns–1, and the
fractions of physical states are 83 and 84%.

Five independent λ-dynamics simulations were performed
for
nucleoside ΨC (reference compound) and nucleotide ΨC. The addition of a 5′ monophosphate group slightly
shifts the tautomeric propensity to favor tautomer ΨC(H1) [from 52 to 41% ΨC(H3)].

Effect of the
Neighboring Bases on the Tautomerization of Pseudoisocytidine
We performed λ-dynamics simulations in single-stranded DNA
trimers and 7-mers with varying sequences to investigate the effect
of neighboring bases on the tautomerization of ΨC
in a single strand. Besides DNA bases thymine (T) and cytidine (C)
as neighboring residues, we also included protonated and/or 5-methylated
C (meC) and restricted sugar moiety (LNA, denoted by underline).

Summarizing Figure 4, we observe that ΨC is
100% ΨC(H3) in the triplex structures, and in the
single-stranded ONs, we found the following ΨC(H3)
propensities (for the ΨC indicated in bold):>75%, C+ΨCC+, meCΨCT, TΨCmeC, TΨCT, meCΨCmeC, meCΨCmeC

60–75%, CΨCC, meC+ΨCmeC+, C+ΨCT, CΨCT, meC+ΨCT, TΨCC+, TΨCC, ΨCTT, ΨCΨCT, ΨCΨCT, ΨCΨCΨC, TTΨCΨCΨCTT, TΨCTTTΨCT

Figure 4 Tautomeric
propensity [given in terms of % tautomer ΨC(H3)]
of pseudoisocytidine in different systems. ΨC is
pseudoisocytidine; meC is 5-methylcytosine; + indicates protonation; underline denotes
residues with locked sugar (LNA). When there are multiple ΨCs, data for the ΨC at the nearest 5′-end
are presented first. The error bar is the standard error of mean of
five independent runs.

With a T or C on either side, the propensity slightly shifts
to
favor tautomer ΨC(H3). Methylated C or protonated
C neighbors also shift the propensity to favor tautomer ΨC(H3), but less so when they are both methylated and protonated.
Analysis of the base–base interaction energies revealed that ΨC(H3) has favorable electrostatic interactions with
a methylated or protonated C neighbor on its 3′-side (Figure S1).

Protonation of an unmethylated
LNA-C (C)
neighbor offers little to no improvement in ΨC(H3)
propensity, and protonation of meC disfavors tautomer ΨC(H3). We would like to reiterate
here that the normal commercial version of LNA-C is always methylated
(meC), and we include unmethylated
LNA-C in our computational study to delineate the contributions of
methylation and sugar locking.

The 7-mer TTΨCmeC+ΨCTT, which contains two ΨCs next to meC, disfavors ΨC(H3) compared with TTΨCTΨCTT, but notably the position trend
is reversed: the 5′ ΨC in TTΨCTΨCTT favors ΨC(H3) more, as generally
observed in other systems (vide infra), but not in TTΨCmeC+ΨCTT where the 3′ ΨC favors ΨC(H3). However, by itself, locked sugars
in the neighboring LNA residues have a modest to no effect on the
tautomeric propensity. There is a modest improvement going from TΨCT to TΨCT, but little to none between meCΨCmeC and meCΨCmeC or ΨCΨCT and ΨCΨCT.

When there is more than a single ΨC residue in
the system, their tautomeric states do not appear to strongly correlate
with each other. In the trimer ΨCΨCT, when the first ΨC is the ΨC(H1)
tautomer, the second ΨC has similar tendencies to
be ΨC(H1) or ΨC(H3); and the same
is observed when the first ΨC is ΨC(H3) (Table 1). However,
when there are more residues in between, the ΨC nearer
to the 3′-end always favors tautomer ΨC(H1),
as observed in 7-mers TTΨCTΨCTT,
TTΨCTTΨCT, and TΨCTTTΨCT. In ΨCΨCΨC and TTΨCΨCΨCTT, when the first ΨC is ΨC(H3), both the second and third ΨCs tend to be ΨC(H1).

a Tautomer combination
is shown in
shorthand; for example, tautomer combination 31 means that the first ΨC is tautomer ΨC(H3) and the second
is ΨC(H1).

The position of ΨC in the sequence has a large
effect on the tautomeric propensity. When ΨC is at
the 5′-end in ΨCTT, the tautomeric propensity
is 63% ΨC(H3), whereas when ΨC is
at the 3′-end in TTΨC, it is 24%. This position
effect can also be clearly observed in 7-mer TΨCTTTΨCT, where both ΨCs are flanked by T,
but their propensities are vastly different [63 and 28% ΨC(H3), respectively]. We observed that when ΨC is
positioned toward the 3′-end, it often forms intramolecular
hydrogen bonds with the preceding residues. Notably, the hydrogen
bonding analyses of trimers and 7-mers show that H1 is much more frequently
involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding compared with N1, N3,
and H3, and it is, to a large extent, correlated with the appearance
of tautomer ΨC(H1). We
select two examples from one run of trimers TΨCT
and TTΨC to show such correlation (Figure 5). The position effect can
thus be explained in terms of intramolecular hydrogen bonds: when ΨC is positioned toward the 3′-end, it has more
available hydrogen bonding partners for H1, favoring the formation
of associated tautomer ΨC(H1).

the intramolecular hydrogen bond involving N1 of residue index 2;
X is any intramolecular hydrogen acceptor or donor. Only the physical
states of tautomers ΨC(H1) (red) and ΨC(H3) (black) are shown. Snapshots of the two trimers at 4 ns are
shown with the intramolecular hydrogen bonds (orange); hydrogen atoms
are not shown for clarity.

More detailed analyses were undertaken for 7-mer TTΨCΨCΨCTT, which is a fragment of
17-mer TFO5-DNALNAΨC used in the triplex formation
experiments. For this 7-mer sequence, we performed another set of
conventional MD simulations, fixing the tautomeric states to be the
most populated one (combination 311: 59%, Table 1) to exclude artifacts from the dual topology
on hydrogen bond and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses.

The two protonation sites associated with the two tautomers are
in similar chemical environments, except for O2 near N3/H3. In 7-mer
TTΨCΨCΨCTT (311),
residues ΨC4 and ΨC5 have some intramolecular
hydrogen bonds involving H1, whereas H3 in ΨC3 has
no such hydrogen bonds (Table 2). Notably, the position effect can be observed here: on average, ΨC5 nearer to the 3′-end has its H1 involved in
more intramolecular hydrogen bonds than ΨC4, which
is nearer to the 5′-end (Table 2).

to intramolecular hydrogen bond involving N1 of residue index 3; X

The SASA
for the N1 atom of Ψ in 7-mer TTΨΨΨTT
(311) is lower for Ψ4 and Ψ5 than for Ψ3, even when
considering the presence of H1 in Ψ4 and Ψ5, whereas for
the N3 atom, the SASA is very similar for Ψ3 and Ψ4 even
though Ψ3 has H3 present and Ψ4 does not (Figure S2). This is consistent with the observation
that Ψ(H1) tends to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds; thus,
it tends to be less exposed to the solvent.

Consecutive ΨC lowers ΨC(H3)
propensities, except for the first residue at the 5′-end. In ΨCΨCT, the first ΨC
has a moderate propensity for ΨC(H3) [65% ΨC(H3)], but the second favors ΨC(H1) instead [42% ΨC(H3)]. The third consecutive ΨC has
an even more pronounced shift: in ΨCΨCΨC, 3′ ΨC has a propensity
of only 9% ΨC(H3). Likewise, in 7-mer TTΨCΨCΨCTT, the last ΨC has a similar propensity [7% ΨC(H3)], and in addition,
the middle ΨC also significantly shifts [3% ΨC(H3)].

The low propensities for ΨC(H3) of consecutive ΨC are deleterious for triplex
formation. Not only does
the 3′ ΨC have a low propensity for ΨC(H3), but the population of favorable tautomer combinations [all ΨC(H3)] is extremely low. In the trimer ΨCΨCΨC, the all-ΨC(H3) (333) population is only 4%; and in 7-mer TTΨCΨCΨCTT, it is 0% (Table 1). However, when the 7-mer is
in a triplex, the all-ΨC(H3) population becomes 100%.
When the middle ΨC in the triplex TTΨCΨCΨCTT is substituted with T so
that the ΨCs are no longer consecutive, as in the
triplex TTΨCTΨCTT, or substituted
with meC+ and introducing LNA neighbors, as
in triplex TTΨCmeC+ΨCTT, the all-ΨC(H3) population is, as expected, 100%.
This suggests that Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding in the triplex is strong
enough to shift the tautomeric propensity to favor ΨC(H3) and confer thermodynamic stability. The low all-ΨC(H3) population in single-stranded systems is of concern because
there is only a small amount of the “correct” population,
that is, with all-ΨC(H3), that can bind to the duplex,
which may result in slow kinetics of binding.

To characterize
the behavior of ΨC(H1) in the
triplex environment, we performed classical MD simulations of triplex
TTΨCΨCΨCTT tautomer
combinations 133 and 331. Although ΨC(H3) forms Hoogsteen
hydrogen bonds with G, ΨC(H1) partially flips out
and interacts with N7 or 5′ phosphate of G instead (Figure 6). The residue ΨC(H1) is not observed to completely flip out, and the
triplexes stay mostly stable during 100 ns simulations (Watson–Crick
and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds during the simulations are shown in Figure S3). The average structures show helical
distortions around ΨC(H1) (Figure 7).

and 333. Average structures from the last 50 ns of the 100 ns simulation
are shown in side and top views (duplex in green and TFO in orange).

In summary, from our simulations,
we have found that the neighboring
residues have different effects on ΨC tautomerization.
Methylated or protonated C shifts the tautomeric propensity to favor ΨC(H3); T or LNA neighbors do not affect the tautomerization
equilibrium directly; ΨC itself as a neighbor affects
the tautomeric propensity to disfavor ΨC(H3), which
is not desirable in the context of TFO binding in triplex formation.

Verifying the Effect of Consecutive and Nonconsecutive ΨC in TFOs for in Vitro Binding
Getting a stable
TFO formation in vitro requires longer TFO sequences than the 7-mer
TFO used in the simulations. To verify the effect of consecutive ΨC-residues, we thus designed TFOs as 17-mers, targeting
a region in the human TFF gene close to an ERE. This
target is a good candidate for in vitro studies of the influence of ΨC in 17-mer TFOs because it contains a majority of Gs,
including stretches of consecutive Gs 5′-AGGGGGAAGGGAAGGAG-3′.34 We decided to evaluate TFOs with this size because
previous in vitro studies performed with 13-mer TFOs containing ΨC bases did not show any TFO binding (unpublished experiments).
Each TFO was hybridized with the double-stranded (DS) target for a period of up to 72 h at
pH 7.4, and the triplex formation was analyzed using EMSA.

Pseudoisocytidines
were located in a consecutive or nonconsecutive manner in the TFOs.
Three different stretches of two, three, and five consecutive ΨCs were present in the sequences of TFO1-DNAfullΨC, TFO2-DNAfullΨC-TINA, TFO3-DNALNAfullΨC, and TFO4-DNALNAfullΨC-TINA, where
TINA denotes twisted intercalating nucleic acid. One or two thymines
(DNA or LNA) were spaced between them, and all of these sequences
contained a ΨC at the 3′-end ultimate position.

Initially, the DNA containing TFO1-DNAfullΨC was
evaluated. In this sequence, all Cs were substituted by ΨC. After 72 h of incubation, no triplex formation was detected, even
in the presence of the triplex-stabilizing BQQ compound (Figure 8). These results
confirm our simulations, where we show that ΨC itself
as a neighbor affects the triplex formation because of the tautomeric
propensity to disfavor ΨC(H3), the desirable tautomer
for triplex formation.

of DS51 in the presence of (b) TFO1-DNAfullΨC and
(c) TFO3-DNALNAfullΨC, both with 11/17 nucleotides
being ΨC and in TFO3 4/6 Ts being LNA Ts. Hybridization
with TFO, in the absence of and (as indicated only at the highest
ratio) in the presence of BQQ, was carried out for 72 h. Triplex structures
are detected as slower migrating bands. DNA duplex and triplex complexes
are indicated as DS and TS, respectively.

Aiming to improve the triplex formation, LNA was included
in the
TFOs. LNA containing ONs have been shown to improve TFO binding and
enhance triplex stability.33 Thus, a TFO
with a similar ΨC distribution as in TFO1-DNAfullΨC, but including four insertions of LNA T (TFO3-DNALNAfullΨC), was also evaluated. The presence
of LNA combined with ΨC improved the TFO binding
but could only be visualized in the presence of BQQ. Moreover, a triplex
was only detected at the highest DS/TFO ratio of 1:800, and 100% of
triplex formation was never achieved (Figure 8).

To further enhance the TFO binding,
a TINA was included at the
penultimate 3′-end position of the TFOs. TINA is an intercalator
inserted covalently into the TFO39 and
is able to increase the thermal stability of parallel triplexes.40 The presence of a TINA in the 3′-end
of T-rich TFOs has previously been shown to strongly promote the triplex
formation at low TFO/DS ratios (Pabon, et al. unpublished result).
Thus, TINA was included in the sequence for TFO1 and TFO3 to create
TFO2-DNAfullΨC-TINA and TFO4-DNALNAfullΨC-TINA, respectively. However, none of these new TFOs showed any
improvement compared with the sequences without TINA (Figure S4).

To examine the effect of several
consecutive ΨCs on TFO binding, we designed two ONs
with six nonconsecutive ΨCs. TFO7-DNAΨC contains three different
combinations with ΨC: ΨCCCΨC, ΨCCΨC, and ΨCC. Triplex formation was evaluated after 72 h of binding. Our results
show that TFO7-DNAΨC was not able to form a triplex
even at the highest concentration of TFO and in the presence of BQQ
(Figure S5). The other TFO lacking consecutive ΨCs, TFO5-DNALNAΨC, contains the combinations meCΨCmeCΨCmeC, ΨCmeCΨC, and meCΨC and
has eight LNA substitutions (three Ts and five meCs). At pH 7.4 and at a DS/TFO ratio
of 1:400, a shifted band was visible, and at the highest ratio of
1:800, approximately 90% of the triplex formation was achieved (Figure 9). TFO5-DNALNAΨC was also evaluated at a lower pH (6.0) in a 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic
acid (MES) buffer containing the same salt conditions as that of the intranuclear buffer. In comparison
with the results at pH 7.4, a shifted band was observed at the DS/TFO
ratio of 1:100 in the absence of BQQ. In the presence of BQQ, triplex
formation was observed at the DS/TFO ratio of 1:25 (Figure S6). Thus, TFO5-DNALNAΨC was the only
ON-showing triplex formation at pH 7.4 under intranuclear salt conditions
at a DS/TFO ratio of 1:400 and in the absence of BQQ. This result
shows again that LNA improves triplex formation, but it also confirms
the conclusion from the simulation experiments that nonconsecutive ΨCs are the best option to include ΨC in the TFO sequence.

absence (left side) and in the presence (right side) of BQQ was carried
out for 72 h. Triplex structures are detected as slower migrating
bands. DNA duplex and triplex complexes are indicated as DS and TS,
respectively.

Pyrimidine triplexes
formed by the base triplet C+•G–C
are pH-dependent. TFOs containing C form stable triplexes under acidic
conditions but are in contrast to G- and T-containing TFOs and are
less active at physiological pH.41 Several
C analogues have been designed to overcome the requirement of acidic
pH; one of them is ΨC. Our TFOs with different combinations
of ΨC and another C analogue (meC) and
including LNAs address the possibility to target highly C-rich TFOs
against sites with several runs of consecutive Gs. Methylated C (meC) has been used to improve pyrimidine TFO binding at neutral
pH, forming triplex structures.42 Here,
we also evaluate a TFO6-DNALNAmeC that contains meC instead of ΨC to compare with TFO5-DNALNAΨC. TFO6-DNALNAmeC did not show any triplex
formation even at the highest concentration of DS/TFO ratio (1:800)
and in the presence of BQQ (Figure 7). Collectively, this shows an enhanced TFO binding
when combining LNA with nonconsecutive ΨCs, also
for a TFO targeting a G-rich site.

The observation that TFO6-DNALNAmeC did not show any
triplex formation agrees with previous studies where triplex formation
is disfavored with consecutive C+•G–C triplets43 because of repulsion between the positive charges
from the protonation at N3 of the Hoogsteen C44 and the competition effect between the Cs in the adjacent C+•G–C.45

Pseudoisocytidine
has previously been reported to reduce the pH
sensitivity in TFOs. Shahid et al. tested different pyrimidine DNA-TFOs
against a 21-base target with only a single 4-base C-run,25 demonstrating that at pH 7.2 and in the presence
of 5 mM MgCl2, alternating ΨC with meC gave the highest triplex stability as determined by the
melting experiment and by gel-shift assays at a ratio of 1:500. An
8-mer DNA-TFO containing two ΨCs was also shown to
form a triplex at pH 7.0, whereas the corresponding all-DNA ON containing
C or meC at the same two positions does not.22 Still, at pH 7.0, the proton concentration is
2.5 times lower than what is found inside of the cell. In intramolecular
triplexes, Chin et al. observed stabilization as measured by the melting
temperature when three Cs were substituted with ΨC and 2′-O-methyl-ΨC.44−46 Also, it has been shown that ΨC combined with peptide
nucleic acid (PNA) at the 3′-end of the TFO in a nonconsecutive
manner with every second position containing a T47,48 can reduce the pH sensitivity. On the basis of NMR experiments,
Leitner et al. have demonstrated that for intramolecular TFO-DNA,
protonation is disfavored for adjacent C or for C at the end of the
triplex,49 also arguing in favor of our
in silico and in vitro results. All of these reports are in line with
our conclusion that ΨC in a nonconsecutive manner
is the best option for designing DNA/LNA mixmer TFOs containing ΨC. The TFO was able to target the G-rich region under
intranuclear conditions when ΨC is flanked by meC or T, in
agreement with simulation results (Table 3). To our knowledge, this is the first time
that this is shown in vitro for TFO DNA/LNA containing ΨC.

sequence in which ΨC gives >75% ΨC(H3) tautomeric propensity in the
λ-dynamics simulations are shaded.

Two different intercalators have been used in this
work: BQQ and
TINA. BQQ is a triplex helix-intercalating compound that can bind
specifically to and stabilize the triplex structures of purine and
pyrimidine motifs.50 We have also previously used BQQ to
confirm and probe for triplex formation using different TFOs (Pabon
et al. unpublished result). There we demonstrated that BQQ could also
stabilize triplexes formed by LNA-containing TFOs. Here, we can confirm
that this is also valid for C-rich TFOs with consecutive ΨC. Also, this is the first study showing that BQQ can stabilize ΨC-containing TFO DNA/LNA. The influence of TINA positioning
is not discussed in this work, but we have chosen to locate TINA at
the 3′-end position based on previous work (Pabon et al. unpublished
result). Surprisingly, the presence of TINA in our ΨC-containing TFOs seems not to increase the rate of triplex formation
under the experimental conditions used here.

Structural Characterization
of Triplex-Containing TFO5-DNALNAΨC
To characterize
the 3D structure of the triplex
containing TFO5-DNALNAΨC, we performed simulations
with classical MD at fixed tautomeric states. We fixed the tautomerization
state of ΨC to be ΨC(H3); based
on the result in the smaller triplexes, all-ΨC(H3)
is favored in the triplex environment. We found that the triplex is
stable during the course of the simulation, preserving most of the
Watson–Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (Figure 10). Out
of four independent runs, one has a loss of Hoogsteen hydrogen bond
towards the 3′-end, but the other three are similar, where
all Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are preserved most of the time (one such
run is shown in Figure S7). The average
structure shows no obvious distortion in the triplex structure that
might contribute to instability (Figure 10). Upon binding of TFO5, the DNA duplex
overslides in the negative direction to accommodate the third strand.
The resultant helical structure has slide and twist parameters similar
to A-type duplex DNA, but an x-displacement value
is between those of A- and B-types (Figure 10). Replacing LNA with DNA in the bound TFO
does not affect the structural feature of the triplex (Figure S8), supporting that what promotes LNA-containing
TFO binding to the DNA duplex is that the TFO is indeed preorganized
for major groove binding (Pabon et al. unpublished data). In conclusion,
upon binding of ΨC-containing TFO, the triple helical
conformation is between A- and B-types with base pairs remaining almost
perpendicular to the helical axis, in agreement with what was observed
in other DNA duplexes involved in triplex formation.28

values for A- and B-form DNAs, respectively.51

Conclusions
We
have performed λ-dynamics simulations and binding experiments
under intranuclear conditions to investigate the ability of pseudoisocytidine
to efficiently target the major groove of a DNA duplex and form a
triplex structure. In particular, we have investigated the tautomerization
of ΨC in different short single-stranded and triplex
DNAs. In single strands, we have observed a clear influence of sequence
on the tautomeric propensity of ΨC. The predisposition
for tautomer ΨC(H3) is higher when the neighboring
residues are cytidines (even higher when cytidine is 5-methylated)
compared with when they are thymine. When the neighboring residues
are ΨC, the propensity of tautomer ΨC(H3) (located between two ΨCs) is low. Furthermore,
the sugar modification LNA on the neighboring residues does not affect
the ΨC tautomerization equilibrium directly.

Once the single strand is bound to the targeted duplex, forming
a triplex, nearly all ΨCs are ΨC(H3)
tautomers, allowing hydrogen bonding with the Hoogsteen site of the
guanine of the double strand, even if the propensity of ΨC(H3) in free, unbound TFOs was very low, as in the case of consecutive
runs of ΨCs. This suggests that Hoogsteen hydrogen
bonding in the triplex is strong enough to shift the tautomeric predisposition
to favor ΨC(H3) and confer thermodynamic stability.

The in vitro experiment shows that the TFOs having three or more
consecutive ΨCs, such as TFO-DNAfullΨC and TFO-DNALNAfullΨC, were unable to form triplexes
under intranuclear salt conditions at pH 7.4 (also when ligands promoting
triplex formation such as BQQ and TINA were included). Only when nonconsecutive ΨCs were included in combination with alternating DNA/LNA
residues (LNA residues are meC and T), the 17-mer TFO was able to form a triplex. In the
formed triplex, the pseudoisocytidine targeted the Hoogsteen site
of the guanine with two hydrogen bonds, and the duplex structure goes
under conformation rearrangement with slide and twist parameters similar
to A-type, but the x-displacement is between those
of A- and B-forms.

We conclude, based on the combination of
in silico and in vitro
studies, that the inclusion of alternating ΨC and
the combination with alternating LNA enhances the formation of the
evaluated C-rich intermolecular triplexes. Therefore, based on our
results, we suggest that when designing DNA/LNA mixmer TFOs containing ΨC, incorporation of ΨC and LNA in a
nonconsecutive manner is preferable.

Materials and Methods
Simulations
The tautomeric equilibria are influenced
by chemical and physical factors, including solvent, ion concentration,
and biomolecular environment. An accurate prediction should account
for the small energy differences that cause shifts in the tautomeric
equilibrium and the need to sample different conformational states
accessible to the biomolecule. Methods based on a macroscopic description
of the biomolecule and the solvent do not explicitly account for dielectric
heterogeneity and response to conformational rearrangement, nor do
they take into account the conformational rearrangement.52 We choose the λ-dynamics approach with
an explicit description of the solvent53 because it addresses these issues by enabling the direct coupling
between tautomerization processes and conformational dynamics. Moreover,
the accuracy of the method can be improved through a fine calibration
of the force field.

Theory
Multisite λ-dynamics53 is set up for the ΨC residue
such that
the two tautomeric states ΨC(H1) and ΨC(H3) are described and propagated by continuous variables λH1 and λH3, respectively. The potential energy
function is given by  where X is the coordinates
of the environment atoms, xH1 and xH3 are the coordinates of atoms in ΨC, corresponding to the tautomers ΨC(H1) and ΨC(H3) respectively, and  where Hi refers to the tautomeric
state ΨC(H1) or ΨC(H3). λHi scales the potential energy of the corresponding
tautomer with the constraints  

ΔGH1→H3 (model) is the free energy for transforming tautomer ΨC(H1) into ΨC(H3) of the pseudoisocytidine model
compound in aqueous solution. This term is included to flatten the
potential energy surface such that the two tautomeric states of the
nucleoside in solution are equipopulated as the free energy between
the two states becomes zero. The model compound structure used in
the free energy calculation is the reference state at which the tautomeric
ratio ΨC(H1)/ΨC(H3) is 1:1. In the
investigated systems, the deviation from this tautomeric ratio would
come from the contribution of the environment.

Two harmonic
biasing potentials Fbias(λH1) and Fbias(λH3) are
included to bias the sampling toward the physical end
states. In this formulation, 0.8 ≤ λHi ≤ 1 is considered to be a physical end state. kbias is the force constant of the harmonic potentials.
The force constant is equal for both tautomeric states.

Calculation
of Free Energy
The free energy, ΔGH1→H3(model), was calculated using the
Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) method.54 The pseudoisocytidine hybrid model compound used in the free energy
perturbation calculation is constructed with deoxyribose sugar and
5′ and 3′ hydroxyls and two pyrimidine bases corresponding
to the two tautomeric states (CHARMM dual topology); the two bases
are maintained within the same volume of space by distance restraints
between all pairs of common atoms in the two tautomeric states. The
residue is solvated with TIP3P water molecules55 in a cubic box with 20 Å side length. The CHARMM BLOCK
module56 is used to partition the system
into three blocks: (I) environment, (II) tautomer ΨC(H1) base, and (III) tautomer ΨC(H3) base. Interactions
between blocks II and III are set to null; interactions between blocks
I and II and within block II are scaled with λ; interactions
between blocks I and III and within block III are scaled with 1 –
λ. Scaling with λ and 1 – λ is not applied
to the bond, angle, and dihedral energy terms. Eight λ values
corresponding to alchemical intermediate/end states were used (λ
= 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0), and each window simulation
length is 1 ns, with only the last 900 ps used for the BAR calculation.
The CHARMM REPD module56 is used to run
eight alchemical intermediate/end states in parallel and attempt to
exchange energies every 1000 steps (Hamiltonian replica exchange).
The calculated free energy is 28.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol.

Calibration
of the Biasing Potential Force Constant
The value of kbias is calibrated by performing
1 ns runs of λ-dynamics at various kbias values and observing the fraction of physical end states in the
trajectory (FPL, fraction physical ligand) and the frequency of transitions
between the two tautomeric states (transition rate, ns–1). An optimal value of kbias was chosen
so as to yield a high transition rate and simultaneously maintain
a high FPL (above 0.8).53 The initial kbias values are 15, 20, 25, and 30 kcal/mol.
Additional runs are added as needed to determine the optimal value.
The value of the optimized kbias is 19.5
kcal/mol.

Simulation Settings
Simulations
were performed with
CHARMM (version 41a2)56 with CHARMM36 force
field for DNA,57 TIP3P water,55 ions,58 and modified
nucleic acids59,60 (for ΨC). Updated
LNA parameters were used (Xu; Nilsson; Villa unpublished result).
Initial 7-mer and 17-mer triplex structures were taken from a parallel
DNA triplex fiber model from the 3DNA Web server.61 For both 7-mer and 17-mer triplexes, the duplex is longer
than the TFO by 2 residues at either side. The third strand of the
triplex is used as the initial structure for the single-strand trimers
and 7-mers.

For single-strand monomers, trimers, 7-mers, and
7-mer triplexes, λ-dynamics was used to allow interconversion
between the two ΨC tautomers. Several selected systems
were also run with the standard MD (fixed tautomer state) to aid analysis—these
are run with the same cutoff, settings, and lengths as the λ-dynamics
run, but with single topology without λ scaling. For the 17-mer
triplex, conventional MD simulation is used and the tautomeric state
of ΨC is fixed to tautomer ΨC(H3),
the tautomer involved in Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. For all λ-dynamics
simulations, five independent runs were performed. Simulation lengths
were chosen so that the standard errors of the mean of the tautomeric
propensities from five runs do not exceed 10%. For monomers and trimers,
these are 6 ns; 7-mers, 8 ns; and 7-mer triplexes, 40 ns. For MD simulation
of the 17-mer triplex, four independent 100 ns runs were performed.
Simulation systems and lengths are summarized in Table S1.

The structures were minimized with the steepest
descent and adopted-basis
Newton–Raphson methods with large position restraints on the
heavy atoms. For triplexes, additional distance restraints are added
for Watson–Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. The systems
were solvated in boxes of TIP3P water molecules, with dimensions of
20 × 20 × 20 Å3 for monomers, 50 ×
50 × 50 Å3 for trimers and 7-mers, 65 ×
45 × 45 Å3 for 7-mer triplexes, and 88 ×
42 × 42 Å3 for 17-mer triplexes. After the addition
of sodium ions to neutralize the system, additional sodium and chloride
ions are included to reach an ionic concentration of approximately
0.1 M.

λ-dynamics is performed within the CHARMM BLOCK
module56 using the multisite λ-dynamics
framework
(MSLD).62 The functional form of λHi, , was used. Defining
λ as a function
of θ in this way has been shown to be optimal for sampling and
convergence.63 θ is assigned a fictitious
mass of 12 amu·Å2 (amu = atomic mass unit). The
temperature was maintained at 298 K by coupling to Langevin heat bath
with a collision frequency of 10 ps–1. λ is
saved every 10 steps. The bond, angle, and dihedral energy terms are
excluded from scaling by λ so that only geometrically relevant
states are sampled. A sampling bias was applied for each tautomeric
state with a force constant of 19.5 kcal/mol. A nonbonded list cutoff
of 15 Å was used with the electrostatic force switch and van
der Waals switch functions between 10 and 12 Å. Simulations were
performed in the NVT ensemble with Langevin dynamics with a collision
frequency of 10 ps–1. For 7-mer triplexes, distance
restraints were applied to Watson–Crick and Hoogsteen hydrogen
bonds (distance 2.9 Å and force constant 10 kcal/mol/Å2) for the base pairs at 5′- and 3′-end positions.

MD simulations for 17-mer triplexes were performed on graphics
processing units (GPUs) with CHARMM56 and
the CHARMM/OpenMM64 interface in the NVT
ensemble with Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 5 ps–1. A van der Waals force switching function was used
between 8 and 9 Å. Particle mesh Ewald was used to treat electrostatic
interactions with a nonbonded cutoff of 8 Å and a grid point
spacing of 1.0 Å. The distance cutoff in generating the list
of pairwise interactions was 17 Å. The temperature was maintained
at 298 K by coupling to a Langevin heat bath with a frictional coefficient
of 10 ps–1. Distance restraints were applied to
Watson–Crick hydrogen bonds (distance 2.9 Å and force
constant 10 kcal/mol/Å2) for the base pair in the
5′- and 3′-ends and all Hoogsteen N7-N3 hydrogen bonds
(same distance and force constant). After minimization, the system
was equilibrated for 2 ns. During production, the distance restraints
on the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds were released.

In all simulations,
the SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds
involving hydrogen.65 A lookup table was
used for interactions between water molecules,66 except for GPU simulations. The leapfrog integrator was
used with an integration time-step of 2 fs. The hydrogen bond, interaction
energy, and SASA analyses were performed within CHARMM. Triplex base
pair step parameter analyses were performed with Curves+.67

In Vitro Binding Experiments
ONs
Standard methods were used to synthesize the ONs
containing pyrimidine analogues and TINA. TFO5 and TFO6 were synthesized
at the Nucleic Acid Center at the University of Southern Denmark in
Jesper Wengel Laboratory. Mixmer LNA/DNA ONs were synthesized using
solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated DNA synthesizer
on a 1.0 mmol synthesis scale.68 Purification
to at least 85% purity of all modified ONs was performed using reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or ion-exchange HPLC
(IE-HPLC), and the composition of all synthesized ONs was verified
using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI-MS) analysis recorded using 3-hydroxypicolinic acid as a matrix.
TFO1-TFO4 and TFO7 were provided by Anapa Biotech A/S Company from
Denmark. DNA target sequences were ordered from Sigma. The ONs and
target sequences used here are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
The ON concentrations of stock solutions were confirmed using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

ON Hybridization
The double-stranded (DS) target (5.0
nM) was incubated with ONs at different
concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μM, corresponding to
TFO versus DS target ratios of 100, 200, 400, and 800, respectively).
Many cytosine-rich ONs can potentially form an intramolecular i-motif69 and to avoid that, the TFOs were heated before
hybridization for 5 min at 65 °C, followed by cooling on ice.
Hybridization was performed in an intranuclear buffer (Tris-acetate
50 mM, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM MgOAc) and in a total
volume of 10 μL at 37 °C for up to 72 h in the absence
or presence of BQQ (1 μM).

Preparation of 32P-Labeled dsDNA Target
The pyrimidine strand of the target
sequence was labeled using [γ-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide
kinase (Fermentas) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol and then purified using a QIAquick
Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). The pyrimidine strand labeled ON
was annealed with the unlabeled complementary strand at a 1:1 ratio.
The annealing was performed by heating for 5 min at 95 °C, followed
by decreasing the temperature to 40 °C at a rate of 1 grade per
minute using a thermocycler.

Electrophoretic Mobility
Shift Assay (EMSA)
DNA complexes
were analyzed using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
10% (29:1) in Tris-acetate–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) (TAE) buffer (1×, pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.5 mM MgOAc
and 5 mM NaCl). The gels were run at 150 V and 200 mA for 5 h with
circulation water cooling and analyzed using a Molecular Imager FX
system. The intensity of the gel bands was quantified using the Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad). All experiments were repeated three times.
