We
have investigated adsorption-induced deformation in graphene
oxide framework materials (GOFs) using neutron diffraction at sample
pressures up to 140 bar. GOFs, made by the solvothermal reaction of
graphite oxide and benzene-1,4-diboronic acid, are a suitable candidate
for deformation studies due to their narrow (∼1 nm), monodispersed,
slit-shaped pores whose width can be measured by diffraction techniques.
We have observed, in situ, a monotonic expansion of the slit width
with increasing pressure upon adsorption of xenon, methane, and hydrogen
under supercritical conditions. The expansion of ∼4% observed
for xenon at a pressure of 48 bar is the largest deformation yet reported
for supercritical adsorption on a carbonaceous material. We find that
the expansion of the three gases can be mapped onto a common curve
based solely on their Lennard-Jones parameters, in a manner similar
to a law of corresponding states.

1 Introduction
The
expansion of carbon-based materials upon molecular adsorption
has been known for many years.1−3 Most thoroughly studied has been
adsorption from the liquid state where the expansions observed are
the largest.4−13 However, pore dynamics in response to supercritical adsorption has
been subjected to much less experimental investigation. It is desirable
to address this situation on two accounts. From a technological perspective,
supercritical adsorption has a potential role in such areas of current
interest as methane capture, hydrogen storage, battery materials,
and gas separation.14−18 Also, from a fundamental perspective, supercritical adsorption allows
the study of systems in which the dominant interactions are described
by van der Waals potentials and hence are more tractable theoretically.19 Here, we report experimental investigation of
the expansion induced by van der Waals gases in an adsorbent well
described by “slit-shaped” pores, materials known as
graphene oxide frameworks (GOFs).20

Early studies with liquid adsorbents on graphite oxide (GO)4,5 showed its interlayer spacing to increase by as much as 50% upon
adsorption of polar solvents with as many as two layers of molecules
intercalating between the GO sheets. Later results6 demonstrated a strong temperature dependence of the structure
of these same graphite oxide/alcohol complexes. More recently, interest
in exfoliating GO to produce graphene has revived research in these
GO/solvent systems.7−11 The correlation between a solvent’s chemical properties and
the degree of expansion has been investigated for a variety of solvents
of different polarity, molecular size, and strength of interaction
with the adsobent.7,8 Remarkably, in the case of water
adsorbed in graphite oxides, the system shows a negative thermal expansion
coefficient12 and a negative compressibility
at mechanical pressures up 1.5 GPa.21

An adsorbent response to the adsorption of a van der Waals gas
has been observed for a few carbon-based materials including activated
carbon and carbon xerogels. The most common experimental technique
for studying adsorption-induced deformation has been dilatometry.1,2,22−25 We note that dilatometry measures
the macroscopic length change of a bulk sample with a resolution typically
on the order of micrometers and sample lengths on the order of centimeters.
Balzer et al.23,24 used dilatometry to study the
deformation of carbon xerogels caused by adsorption of gases N2, Ar, CO2, and H2O under subcritical
conditions. For all four gases, they observed an initial contraction
followed by an expansion as the gas approached the saturated vapor
pressure. Shkolin and Fomkin25 measured
the expansion of an activated carbon upon the adsorption of supercritical
methane using a similar experimental setup. They also observed an
initial contraction followed by an expansion with a maximal strain
of ∼0.2% at 60 bar.

In addition, small-angle neutron
and X-ray scattering have also
been used to study pore deformation upon adsorption26,27 at subcritical temperatures. In contrast to dilatometry, these techniques
offer the advantage of being able to probe on a length scale of ∼1–10
nm. Bahadur et al.26 observed an initial
expansion of activated carbon upon adsorption of CO2 followed
by a contraction as the gas approached saturation, a strain isotherm
that differs markedly from that observed by Balzer et al.23 Detailed analysis of measurements on activated
carbon is difficult due to the variety of pore shapes and sizes. For
this reason, it is desirable to perform measurements on more uniform
materials, that is, with a unimodal pore shape and a monodispersed
pore size.

As will be discussed below, a number of authors have
attempted
to compute the response of an adsorbent during sub- and supercritical
adsorption.13,28−31 In these studies, the adsorbent
is typically modeled as containing uniform slit-shaped pores with
walls connected by a linear spring. Such models have yielded an expansion
for small pores, contraction for large pores, and nonmonotonic behavior
for intermediate cases.

In this paper, we demonstrate that materials
called graphene oxide
frameworks (GOFs), which have well-defined slit-shaped pores, permit
an in situ measurement of pore width by neutron diffraction. Such
measurements can provide a valuable test of theoretical models and/or
computer simulations of adsorption-induced expansion. GOFs have been
recently investigated for applications in catalysis,32 separation,33 battery materials,34 and gas storage.20,35−37 In contrast to activated carbons, which have a disordered pore structure,
GOFs are made with a rational design that provides a route to fabricating
complex and functional carbon adsorbents. They contain a more ordered
pore geometry than activated carbons, while still achieving surface
areas up to 1000 m2/g.36 A synthesis
using an intercalation procedure was originally proposed by Burress
et al. in 2010.20 It entailed dissolving
benzene-1,4-diboronic acid (DBA) in methanol and then intercalating
the DBA into graphite oxide. The authors proposed a reaction of DBA
with the hydroxyl groups of the graphite oxide, resulting in a covalent
cross-linking of the sheets as shown in Figure 1a. Mercier et al.36 proposed an alternative model of GOFs in which the DBA molecules
are physically adsorbed between oxidized areas of adjacent graphene
sheets rather than covalently bonded to them (Figure 1b). They gave several reasons justifying
their model, including the observation that GOFs swell by as much
as 50% when wetted with methanol. Such swelling would be unlikely
within the covalently cross-linked model with DBA molecules perpendicular
to the GO layers. Presumably, these two models would also have markedly
different strain isotherms. As discussed in the next sections, we
have used volumetric adsorption isotherms and in situ neutron diffraction
to investigate the gas pressure-induced expansion of GOFs and find
that they can be mapped onto a common curve depending on the van der
Waals parameters of the gas/solid interactions.

GOFs: (a) Covalently cross-linked model of

2 Experimental Section
2.1 GOF Synthesis
and Characterization
We made graphene oxide (GO) from a synthetic
graphite powder (Alfa
Aesar, 7–11 micron) using a modified Hummer’s method.38 The quality of the GO was confirmed with Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure S1) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 2). The interlayer spacing increased from
0.335 nm (graphite) to 0.811 nm (GO) consistent with previous values
for well-oxidized carbon sheets.36,39,40 Peaks in the FTIR spectrum at 725, 1400, and 1100
cm–1 are attributed to the presence of carbonyl,
hydroxyl, and epoxide groups, respectively,39,41 and provide further confirmation of a standard GO composition (see
the Supporting Information Figure S1).

Figure 2 Comparison
of the XRD scans for GO and GOF. An interlayer spacing
of 1.03 nm is within the range of previously reported GOF samples20,36 (0.90–1.05 nm).

To produce GOFs for the
in situ neutron scattering measurements,
we used the optimized synthesis parameters established by Mercier
et al.36 including linker ratio and reaction
temperature and time. A mass ratio of 1:3 GO:benzene-1,4-diboronic
acid (DBA) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to methanol. The solution was
placed on a vortex shaker to dissolve the acid and disperse the GO
and then decanted into a metal-jacketed acid digestion vessel to facilitate
a closed reaction at elevated temperatures. The vessel was placed
in an oven at 90 °C for 24 h. After removal from the oven, the
solution was transferred into a falcon tube and centrifuged to separate
the GOF from solution with the excess methanol and DBA decanted off.
The centrifugation step was repeated multiple times, adding methanol
each time, to remove excess DBA. The samples were then dried in a
vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h to remove residual methanol. GOFs
were characterized with XRD, nitrogen sorption, and prompt gamma activation
analysis (PGAA) to confirm the samples shared the same pore structure
and linker concentration as those previously reported in the literature.
Established properties of GOF include a relatively high specific surface
area (∼400 m2/g or greater), a high concentration
of subnanometer pores, an expanded interlayer spacing of ∼9.5
Å (dry)/∼10.5 Å (in air), and an ∼3 at% concentration
of boron (from DBA linker).20,36 We present characterization
data of all synthesized batches in the Supporting Information (Figures S6–S12). The best batch, judged
by the above criteria, was then selected for in situ neutron diffraction
scattering measurements and is discussed here. Due to limited beam
time at the neutron scattering facility, observations of adsorption
induced expansion were limited to this batch.

PGAA measurements42 (Figure S2) revealed our GOF contained 3.4 wt
% boron, equivalent to a C:DBA ratio of about 35:1. This DBA linker
concentration is comparable to those observed by Mercier et al.36 (46:1) and Burress et al.20 (33:1 to 55:1). XRD measurements (Figure 2) were taken on a Scintag X2 diffractometer,
using a Cu Kα source (0.154 nm wavelength). The interlayer spacing, d001, calculated from the sample’s (001)
Bragg reflection, increased from 0.81 nm for the GO precursor to 1.03
nm for the GOF. This increase indicates successful incorporation of
the DBA molecules between the GO sheets and is consistent with interlayer
spacings previously observed for GOFs (0.9–1.1 nm).20,36,43 The crystallite dimension, κλ/(β
cos θ), was also extracted from the XRD data (Figure 2) where κ is a shape
factor chosen to be 0.9, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β
is the full-width-at-half-maximum of the (001) Bragg reflection in
radians, and θ is the Bragg angle.44 The crystallite domain size normal to the graphene sheets of the
GO sample in Figure 2 is ∼13.7 nm compared to ∼16.9 nm for the GOF. Interestingly,
both dimensions correspond to about 17 stacked GO sheets, suggesting
that incorporation of the DBA does not markedly change the stack size.

Subcritical nitrogen isotherms (Figure 3) were measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb
1-c. Samples were outgassed at 120 °C without exposure to air
before nitrogen loading. The BET surface area was determined with
a P/P0 range of 0.01
to 0.03 suitable for nanoporous materials.45 The measured specific BET surface area, Σ = 390 m2/g, is within or close to the ranges reported for GOFs in the literature
(410–1030 m2/g36 and
70–470 m2/g20). We observed
an extended hysteresis loop between the adsorption and desorption
legs of the nitrogen isotherm. Such behavior is not one of the canonical
subcritical nitrogen isotherms enumerated by the IUPAC.45 It was an early indication that the pore structure
may be changing as a function of amount adsorbed.

Figure 3 Subcritical N2 adsorption isotherms used for BET analysis.
The extended hysteresis loop observed in our GOF samples (also see Figures S7 and S11) provides initial evidence
of a changing pore volume. The hysteresis loop does not close until
10–3P/P0 (inset). The steep rise in volume adsorbed at low pressure is indicative
of subnanometer pores in the GOF.

We extracted the pore size distribution (Figure 4) from the nitrogen isotherm data using the
QSDFT model for slit-shaped pores.46 As
previously observed with GOFs, the majority of the pore volume comes
from pores of width < 1.0 nm with the mode of the distribution
at ∼0.7 nm. Some degree of caution must be observed when interpreting
pore size distributions calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms.
Quantitative conclusions are especially difficult for pores of width
comparable to the size of the adsorbate molecules, as they are expected
to be in our GOF samples, due to the long equilibration times for
pore filling at P/P0 <
10–4.47 With this caution
in mind, the pore size distribution and the XRD data provide a consistent
model of the pore structure of our GOF sample. Pore size distributions
measure the void distance between the GO sheets defining the slit,
whereas XRD measures d001, i.e., the center-of-carbon
to center-of-carbon distance between GO sheets. The difference between
these two measures of the pore width is approximately the diameter
of a GO carbon atom (∼0.3 nm). Therefore, the peak in the XRD
at 1.03 nm (Figure 2) is consistent with the slit-pore width of ∼0.7 nm observed
in the pore size distribution. The total pore volume, Vpore = 0.24 cm3/g, was determined from the
adsorbed volume at P/P0 = 0.99.45

from QSDFT, assuming slit-shaped pores. The GOF has a unimodal pore
size distribution with narrow pores (0.6–0.8 nm) predominant.

2.2 Adsorption Experiments
We performed
adsorption measurements with a custom-built volumetric gas adsorption
apparatus capable of measurements up to 140 bar. The manifold is equipped
with a digital temperature sensor and two transducers to measure pressures
ranging from 10–9 to 245 bar. Sample temperature
is regulated with a Lakeshore 336 temperature controller with a platinum
resistance thermometer mounted on the cold finger of a bottom loading
liquid nitrogen cryostat. For calculation of adsorbed quantities,
pressure and temperature are mapped to densities through the NIST
REFPROP database.48

The instrument
was checked for accuracy with a well-characterized commercial carbon
sample, MSC-30 (MeadWestvaco). High-purity gas has been used in all
experiments (99.995% purity hydrogen, 99.99% purity methane and xenon).
For all adsorption measurements, approximately 400 mg of the GOF sample
was placed in an aluminum sample cell and outgassed under vacuum at
120 °C for 12 h.

2.3 Neutron Diffraction
Neutron diffraction
is well-suited for the in situ structural investigation of GOF expansion
in that neutrons can penetrate the high-pressure aluminum sample cell.
Our neutron diffraction patterns in Figure 5 were obtained using a two-axis diffractometer
equipped with a five-counter multidetector data acquisition system
located at C-port of the University of Missouri Research Reactor.49 The measurements were performed in a transmission
geometry and with a neutron wavelength of 0.433 nm, appropriate for
the large interlayer distances of a GOF. Each diffraction pattern
took ∼20 h with a 0.25° step size in the arm position.
Within the Q-range available, only the first GO/GOF
reflection labeled (001) (see Figure 5a,b), corresponding to the interlayer separation d001, is observable. The small peak at ∼16
nm–1 is due to the presence of a glass wool filter
in the sample cell. Each diffraction peak was fit with a Gaussian
plus a linear background (Figure 5c) where the peak center is at the position Q001 = 2π/d001. While the background across the full Q-range in Figure 5a,b is clearly not
linear, it is a satisfactory approximation in the region of the (001)
peak (see Figure 5c).

3 Results
3.1 Adsorption
Isotherms
We measured
adsorption isotherms of the following gases on GOFs at the temperature(s)
indicated: hydrogen (78 K and 293 K), methane (293 K), and xenon (293
K) (see Figure 6).
These van der Waals gases were selected based on two primary criteria:
(1) the technological interest in hydrogen and methane as energy carriers
and (2) the wide range of their critical temperatures: 33.2 K (H2), 190.8 K (CH4), and 289.8 K (Xe). As we shall
see, the magnitude of the adsorption-induced expansion turns out to
depend on the critical temperature. The measurement of hydrogen excess
adsorption on a GOF at 78 K and 293 K has been reported by at least
two other groups,35,36 whereas methane and xenon isotherms
have not been reported previously. Further discussion of applications
to hydrogen storage is in the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 (a) Excess adsorption of various gases adsorbed on GOF. (b) Absolute
adsorption of various gases adsorbed on the same sample. The absolute
will always be greater than the excess adsorption.

In Figure 6a, we
show the amount adsorbed in terms of the Gibbs excess, Nexc, defined as the difference (normalized to the adsorbent
mass) between the number of adsorbed gas molecules in the system and
the number that would be present at the same temperature and pressure
in the absence of the adsorbent.45 The
Gibbs excess is the most direct experimental quantity available in
that the only material parameter required in its calculation is the
skeletal volume of the adsorbent (volume of sample inaccessible to
gas). We also report (Figure 6b) the absolute adsorption, Nabs, defined as the total number of adsorbed gas molecules per mass
of the adsorbent, a more basic physical quantity than the Gibbs excess
except that it requires introducing the total pore volume, Vpore, of the adsorbent as a parameter (see section 2.1). The absolute
adsorption Nabs may be calculated from
the excess adsorption using 1  where ρbulk is the
density of the bulk gas in the system.

3.2 Diffraction
At each point along the
adsorption isotherms of the three gases adsorbed on our GOF sample
(Figure 6), we obtained
an in situ neutron diffraction pattern (Figures S3, S4, and S5). Unfortunately, time constraints did not allow tandem
isotherm/diffraction measurements with adsorbed N2. In
the time available, we felt that extending the range of critical temperatures
down to 33 K as offered by H2 as well as its technological
interest outweighed investigating the origin of the hysteresis seen
in the subcritical adsorption isotherm of N2. The interlayer
spacing d001 is determined from a Gaussian
fit to the (001) Bragg peak, as exemplified in Figure 5, and plotted versus pressure in Figure 7. First, we note
that the initial interlayer spacing (vacuum) measured by neutron diffraction
is 0.937 nm rather than 1.03 nm as measured by XRD. This result can
be explained by the neutron diffraction measurement being performed
under vacuum or high-purity gas, whereas XRD was conducted in air.
We believe that this decrease of ∼0.1 nm in d001 results from a loss of water in the sample after outgassing
above 100 °C as was observed by Mercier et al.36 or possibly from a loss of some DBA linkers during outgassing.

of d001 of GOF as a function
of pressure for Xe, CH4, and H2 at temperature
above their critical temperature. In the case of H2, data
is presented at two temperatures, 79 and 293 K.

Second, we observe d001 to increase
with pressure gradually and monotonically for both methane and xenon.
This gradual expansion is inconsistent with characterizing the structural
change as a “gate-opening” transition, which is a term
applied to adsorbent materials, e.g., MOFs, that undergo an abrupt
change in pore shape or geometry under subcritical adsorption.31,50−52 Such a transition typically results from a bulk phase
change of the adsorbate (such as capillary condensation). However,
the isotherm of each of our gases is measured at supercritical conditions;
thus, no phase change of the bulk fluid occurs.

Xenon shows
the largest increase in d001 with pressure.
To our knowledge, the 4% increase in d001 that we have observed at a maximum bottle pressure
of 48 bar is the largest expansion reported for supercritical adsorption.
Furthermore, the interlayer spacing is still increasing at this pressure.

4 Discussion
Given that at supercritical temperatures,
the interaction of methane,
hydrogen, and xenon with the GO sheets of GOFs is well described by
van der Waals interactions, we seek a more general understanding of
the expansion observed. In Figure 7, the dependence of d001 on pressure changes significantly with gas and temperature. In all
cases, however, the expansion begins rapidly and then slows down as
the pressure increases in a way that is reminiscent of the absolute
adsorption isotherms Nabs(P) shown in Figure 6. This behavior suggested plotting the interlayer spacing d001 as function of the absolute amount of adsorbed
gas Nabs in the pores as shown in Figure 8. Now, the observed
expansion of the GOF under the pressure of Xe and CH4 does
not level off at high. This dependence of d001 on Nabs motivated us to consider whether
the expansion could be explained in terms of the interaction strength
of the gases with the GO sheets.

Figure 8 Interlayer spacing d001 as a function
of the absolute amount of gas adsorbed in the pores Nabs (cf. Figures 6 and 7). The expansion versus the amount
adsorbed does not level off at high Nabs for Xe and CH4.

During the past decade, a theoretical basis for adsorption-induced
deformation of porous materials has been investigated by several authors.28,31 A model of carbonaceous slit-shaped pores connected by a linear
spring showed them to deform during adsorption with an expansion observed
for small pores (d001 < 0.84 nm) and
contraction for larger ones (d001 >
1.23
nm). A nonmonotonic pore response was found for intermediate widths.
For slit pores with a d001 ≈ 0.94
nm, which dominate our GOF sample, the dependence of interlayer spacing
on pressure was predicted to contract initially before expanding above
a certain pressure,28 whereas we observe
a monotonic expansion in our system. These results suggest that the
assumption of slit pores spanned by a linear spring as in refs (17) and (20) may not adequately represent
the response of a GOF for which a more complex linker/spacer framework
may suppress contraction.

In our analysis, we begin by hypothesizing
that the expansion of
the adsorbent results from the energy deposited into the system in
the adsorption process. In other words, we make the ansatz that d001 has the functional dependence 2  where Nabs is the number of adsorbed
molecules (absolute adsorption)
and ϵads is the depth of the holding potential for
adsorption on a GO sheet. As will be discussed further below, we note
that Nabs includes molecules in the sample
that are not between the graphene sheets; however, we make the simplifying
assumption that the number of molecules between the sheets is proportional
to Nabs. A reasonable approximation for
the holding potential of a GO sheet is given by Steele’s potential:53,54 3  

Here, ρs = 38.2 nm–2 is the
areal density of carbon atoms in a graphene sheet and σsf and ϵsf are the Lennard-Jones solid–fluid
interaction parameters calculated using the Lorentz–Berthelot
combination rules:55 4  σss and ϵss, and σff and ϵff are the
solid and fluid parameters, respectively. In assuming this holding
potential, we are neglecting the contribution from functional groups
attached to the graphene. The potential depth is the minimum of V10-4 (eq 3): 5  

For the carbon atoms in a GO sheet, we take σss = 0.34 nm and ϵss/kB = 28 K. Additionally, we take σH2H2 = 0.305 nm, σCH4CH4 = 0.373 nm, σXeXe = 0.407 nm,31,53,54,56 ϵH2H2/kB =
37 K, ϵCH4CH4/kB = 148 K, and ϵXeXe/kB = 226 K. With these values, we obtain ϵads(H2)/kB = 482 K, ϵads(CH4)/kB = 1180 K,
and ϵads(Xe)/kB = 1600
K. For the gases considered here, there is, to a good approximation,
a direct proportionality between ϵff and the square
root of their critical temperature Tc.
Using eq 4, ϵsf ∝ Tc1/2, and eq 5, we rewrite eq 2 as 6  

Figure 9 shows the
dependence of the d001 spacing on Nabs after scaling with respect to the critical
temperature of the adsorbed gas and its Lennard-Jones sigma parameter
σsf (normalized to the values for Xe), according
to eq 6. Here, we have
assumed that the number of gas molecules between the GO sheets is
proportional to Nabs. After scaling, the
methane and xenon data points nearly superimpose. Overall, the overlap
indicates that our ansatz was a good starting point; the interlayer
expansion does appear to be a function of Nabsϵads (we also obtain a posteriori justification
for the assumption of the holding potential in eq 3).

Figure 9 A common expansion curve for the three gases,
Xe (Tc = 290 K), CH4 (Tc = 191 K), and H2 (Tc = 33
K), is obtained by scaling the number of adsorbed molecules Nabs with respect to the critical temperature
and the Lennard-Jones size parameter (normalized to the case of Xe)
as described in the text.

Although scaling according to eq 6 allows Xe and CH4 to share a common curve,
it is evident that the fit for H2, which shows the smallest
expansion, is poor. This situation is similar to the law of corresponding
states where gas and liquid adsorption curves for many atoms and molecules
can be cast into a common curve,57,58 while light
H2 and He deviate from this common curve due to quantum
effects. However, it is difficult to make a quantitative estimate
of quantum effects on the GOF expansion for H2. Another
possible explanation that we have considered for the poorer fit of
H2 to the curve shared by Xe and CH4 in Figure 9 is a change in the
GOF structure on increasing pressure. In the case of H2, we observed the slope of the linear background on which the Bragg
peak rides to increase at pressures in a range of 20–60 bar
and an increase in the width of the Bragg peak in a range of 80–100
bar (see Figure 5 and Figure S5). These changes are consistent with
a decrease in the GOF average grain size and occur at pressures where
the deviation of H2 from the common curve is the largest.
In the case of our measurements on CH4 at pressures up
to 100 bar, which followed those on H2, these effects decreased
in magnitude and do not appear to have had an effect on the determination
of d001. Our subsequent measurements on
Xe were confined to pressures below 40 bar and showed no evidence
of a decrease in the GOF grain size. Therefore, although we cannot
rule out the presence of quantum effects in the GOF expansion observed
for H2, its deviation from the curve common to Xe and CH4 appears to be consistent with a decrease in the GOF grain
size at high pressures. In future measurements, it would probably
be desirable to subject a GOF sample to several pressure cycles before
beginning the diffraction measurements.

As shown in Figure 7, we have observed
a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing
of GOF for all three gases (∼1.5% for H2, ∼3%
for CH4, and ∼4% for Xe). Presumably, the Xe expansion
would continue to increase at higher pressure. It is significant that
the largest expansion occurs for Xe. With the largest polarizability
and ϵff of the three gasses, it has the strongest
van der Waals interaction with the GO sheets.

Next, we note
in Figure 9 that the
expansion of the interlayer spacing of Xe increases
more rapidly above an inflection point at ∼1.5 mol/kg. We suggest
that this change in the expansion rate may be related to the completion
of a fully compressed monolayer within the dominant slit-shaped pores
of width of ∼0.7 nm . The inflection point in the expansion
might then represent the absolute adsorption at which the gas reaches
liquid densities and it becomes easier to separate the GO sheets of
the GOF than to compress the gas further. We can estimate the adsorbed
density from the relation ρads = Mabs/Vpore where Mabs = NabsMw, Mw is the molecular weight
of the gas, and, from section 2.1, Vpore = 0.242 cm3/g. In Figure 10, we have plotted the interlayer spacing d001 versus the adsorbed density of Xe. We see that the inflection point
falls close to the liquid
density of Xe at its critical point, 1.16 g/cm3, consistent
with the scenario that we have described above.

Figure 10 The density of the adsorbed
xenon inside the pore space of GOF
is compared to the liquid density at the critical point.

5 Conclusions
In summary, we have observed
a reproducible monotonic pore expansion
in GOFs on increasing gas pressure, the largest such expansion yet
observed for supercritical adsorption. Thus, we believe that GOFs
provide useful model systems for studying the effect of adsorption
on deformable slit-shaped pores. In addition, we have shown that the
expansion observed for H2, CH4, and Xe can be
scaled onto a single curve based on the gas critical temperature and
molecular diameter in a way similar to the law of corresponding states.
Future investigations of other van der Waals gases would be desirable
to corroborate this scaling behavior. Nitrogen, whose subcritical
adsorption isotherm showed hysteresis indicative of a pore structure
changing with the amount adsorbed (Figure 3), would be of particular interest. With
a critical temperature of 126 K and a molecular size comparable to
CH4, we would expect N2 to yield an expansion
intermediate between CH4 and H2. We estimate
argon to have an expansion similar to N2 based on its critical
temperature (151 K) and smaller size. The scaling analysis used to
interpret our measurements should also provide guidance to molecular
dynamics simulations of supercritical adsorption of van der Waals
