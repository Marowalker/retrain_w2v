A one-pot gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation/Povarov
reaction cascade
of alkynols with N-aryl imines or in situ generated
iminium has been developed. The protocol provides a facile access
to a series of fused tricyclic tetrahydroquinolines with a broad substrate
scope using readily available materials under mild conditions. The
unique mechanistic feature is the dual function of the gold catalyst,
which first catalyzed the intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkynols,
and upon the formation of dihydrofuran species, promoted the following
Povarov reaction with high stereoselectivity.

Introduction
Tetrahydroquinolines
and their derivatives are common structural
motifs that pervasively exist in many natural products and pharmaceutically
important compounds.1,2 As a consequence, a variety of
methods have been reported for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline
derivatives.3 Among these advances, the
Povarov reaction, which is the inverse electron-demand [4 + 2] cycloaddition
between N-aryl imines and electron-rich olefins,
is a convenient and commonly used method for the synthesis of this
library of molecules (Scheme 1a).4−8 In these cases, a variety of chiral Lewis acids5 or Brønsted acids6 have
generally been the catalysts of choice to promote the corresponding
[4 + 2] cycloadditions. High-to-excellent stereoselectivity has been
realized with these effective catalytic systems; however, the substrate
scope of the Povarov reaction is still a limitation of this method,
especially the dienophile ones, which is mainly due to the few commercially
available electron-rich alkenes, and relative difficulty associated
with the synthesis or purification of these materials. In this respect,
Barluenga and co-workers have reported a one-Pot multicatalytic Povarov
reaction of in situ generated alkenes with imines.7a,7b Later, the analogous version was disclosed by Faňanás
and Rodríguez.7c Recently,
our group has reported a convergent formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition of
two in situ generated species, a cyclic alkene and an iminium ion,
from the corresponding precursors in the presence of an Au catalyst
and Brønsted acid, respectively (Scheme 1b).7f Thus, the
development of the novel Povarov reaction using in situ generated
species, either the N-aryl imines (dienes) or the
electronic-rich alkenes (dienophiles), would have continuing appealing
for the practical and efficient synthesis of tetrahydroquinolines
with structural complexity through relay or cooperative catalysis.7

Scheme 1 Catalytic Povarov Reaction
On the other hand, significant progress has been made
in gold-catalyzed
activation of alkynes in the recent two decades.9 For example, catalytic intramolecular hydroalkoxylation
of alkynols provides general access for the facile construction of
cyclic enol ethers with structural diversity.10−15 Applications of these generated alkenes in a one-pot cascade reaction
have been well studied,14 such as cycloisomerization
and cycloaddition have been disclosed by Shi15a and Feng,15b respectively. In addition,
the gold-catalyzed Povarov reaction followed by ring expansion has
been reported by Liu.8 Inspired by these
advances, together with our interests in gold-catalyzed alkyne transformations,16 herein, we disclose our recent results of one-pot
gold(I)-catalyzed [4 + 2] annulation of alkynols with N-aryl imines or in situ generated iminium that afforded the tricyclic
adducts in good to high yields (Scheme 1c). The gold catalyst features a dual function in this
cascade reaction, which first catalyzed the intramolecular hydroalkoxylation
of alkynols to form the dihydrofuran species and promoted the Povarov
reaction at a later stage with high stereoselectivity.

Results and Discussion
Initially, alkynol (1a) and imine (2a) were selected as model substrates to probe the proposed cascade
reaction in the presence of gold catalysts at 60 °C in dichloroethane
(DCE). To our delight, the reaction proceeded smoothly with either
Au(I) or Au (III) catalysts, giving the hexahydrofuro[3,2-c]quinoline product 3a in 88–72% yields
with up to 14:1 diastereomeric ratio (dr) (Table 1, entries 1–4). Subsequently, various
metal catalysts, including Ag, Rh, Cu, and Pd salts, were investigated
and only attenuated reactivity was observed (entries 5–8).
The best results were obtained when the reaction was catalyzed by
[Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] in terms of yield
and stereoselectivity (entry 1, 88% yield, 14:1 dr). The molecular
structure of 3a was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.17 The obtained high diastereomeric ratio (dr)
is due to the sterically favorable exo-addition, providing the hexahydrofuro[3,2-c]quinolines 3 featuring three contiguous stereogenic
centers, one of them quaternary.

a Reaction conditions: alkynol 1a (0.30 mmol),

(5.0 mol %), in dry DCE (3.0 mL) at 60 °C under an argon atmosphere
overnight.

d Material 1a was
consumed,
and most of 2a remained intact.

Having established optimal reaction conditions for
this one-pot
gold-catalyzed [4 + 2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl alcohols with
imines, the variation of substituents at the alkynols 1 was initially investigated (Scheme 2). Regardless of the position or electronic properties
of the substitutions on the aryl ring of alkynols, all substrates
gave the cyclized adducts in good to high yields with above 7:1 dr
(3a–d and 3f–i, 76–92%
yields), except for the alkynol with strong electronic-deficient aryl
group, and only moderate yield was obtained in this case (3e, 47% yield, 5:1 dr). Notably, the 1-naphthyl, 2-thienyl, and ethyl-substituted
alkynols were all well tolerated in these conditions, producing the
corresponding products in 62–96% yields (3j–l). Then, the reaction was further applied to aryl- and alkyl-substituted
homopropargylic alcohol derivates; these afforded the desired products 3m and 3n in 70% (7:1 dr) and 89% (5:1 dr) yields,
respectively.18 Interestingly, 5-phenylpent-4-yn-1-ol,
which forms the dihydropyran species instead of dihydrofuran in the
gold-catalyzed hydroalkoxylation stage, also delivered the corresponding
tricyclic adduct 3o in good yield with 10:1 dr. To demonstrate
the scalability and the practicality of the current method, a one-pot
Gram-scale reaction was carried out in the presence of 2.0 mol % gold
catalyst, in which 1.06 g of 3c was isolated in 84% yield
with 7:1 dr (Scheme 2, note b).

Scheme 2 Scope of Alkynols 1
Conditions:
alkynols 1 (0.30 mmol), 2 (0.30 mmol), and
[Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] (11.6 mg, 5.0 mol
%), in dry DCE (3.0
mL) at 60 °C under an argon atmosphere overnight.

The reaction carried out on a 3.5 mmol scale with 2.0
mol % catalyst loading.

Subsequently, the reactions of the various N-aryl
imines with alkynol 1f were explored and the results
were summarized in Scheme 3. Imines with a variety of substitutions on the different
positions of the aryl groups all gave the desired products in good
to high yields and isolated as a single diastereoisomer in these cases
(4a–k, 75–97% yields, >20:1
dr). The thiophene aldehyde and piperonal-derived imines could also
selectively deliver the corresponding products 4l and 4m in 88 and 91% yields, respectively. The alkyl aldehyde-derived
imine also tolerated under current conditions, affording the adduct 4n in 65% yield with two diastereoisomers. The structure of 4h was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.17

Scheme 3 Scope of Imines 2
Conditions: alkynol 1f (0.30 mmol), 2 (0.30 mmol), and [Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] (11.6 mg, 5.0 mol %), in dry DCE (3.0
mL) at 60 °C under an argon atmosphere overnight.

To further demonstrate the generality of this cascade
cycloaddition
reaction, benzyl azides 5 served as the precursors of N-aryl formaldimines in this reaction.7d After brief optimization, the corresponding tetrahydroquinoline
products 6 were obtained in 64–75% yields with
above 12.5:1 dr when the reactions were conducted in the presence
of 2.0 equiv trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) at 60 °C (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Povarov Reaction
of Alkynols with Benzyl Azides
The synthetic transformation of generated products 3 is illustrated in Scheme 5. Under the acidic conditions, the tetrahydroquinoline products 3 underwent the ring-opening and aromatization process, delivering
the trisubstituted quinoline derivative 7 in useful yields.

Scheme 5 Derivatization of 3
To gain insight into the reaction mechanism, control experiments
were next carried out (Scheme 6). First, alkynol 1a underwent annulation to
afford 2,3-dihydrofuran 8 in 52% yield under the standard
conditions in the absence of imine (Scheme 6a). With the isolated pure 2,3-dihydrofuran 8 in hand, the reaction of 8 with imine 2a was conducted under optimal conditions, producing 3a in the lower 54% yield with 10:1 dr (Scheme 6b) in comparison with 88% yield of the model
reaction (Table 1,
entry 1, 14:1 dr). These results suggested that 2,3-dihydrofuran 8 was the possible intermediate of this reaction and the obvious
reduction in yield indicated that potential reaction pathway(s) might
coexist in the contribution for the formation of the final product 3. Notably, the yield of the Povarov reaction dropped to 16%
in the absence of gold catalyst, which implied that the gold catalyst
not only promoted the formation of 2,3-dihydrofuran 8 but also facilitated the following Povarov reaction.

Scheme 6 Control
Experiments
On the basis of the above results
and reported literature,10,16 a tentative mechanism
for the present Au(I)-catalyzed [4 + 2]-annulations
of alkynols 1 with N-aryl imines 2 is presented in Scheme 7. The reaction is initiated by coordination of the
cationic gold complex to the triple bond of the starting alkynol 1 to form intermediate B through 5-endo-dig cyclization,
followed by protodemetalation to afford 2,3-dihydrofuran 8 and release of the catalytic cationic gold species.10 Finally, the gold promoted Povarov reaction of 8 with N-aryl imines 2 or a direct [4
+ 2]-annulation of intermediate B with 2 may both contribute to the formation of the tricyclic products 4 or 6. The observed exceptionally high stereoselectivity
of the current reaction may be attributed to the sterically favored
exo-cycloaddition reaction between the N-aryl imines 2 and 2,3-dihydrofuran 8 via TS1, which after rearomatization furnishes the final product with high
diastereoselectivity.

Scheme 7 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a one-pot
gold-catalyzed [4 +
2]-annulation of alkynols with N-aryl imines or in
situ generated iminium. This protocol provides a facile access to
a series of tetrahydroquinolines with structural complexity from readily
available materials. Mechanistically, the gold catalyst plays a dual
role, which not only catalyzed the intramolecular hydroalkoxylation
of alkynols, upon the formation of dihydrofuran species, but also
promoted the following Povarov reaction with high stereoselectivity.
With this method, using the in situ generated alkene or imine for
the Povarov reaction, practical and efficient synthetic approaches
for the synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline derivatives with structural
diversity could be envisioned.

Experimental Section
General
All reactions
were carried out in oven-dried
glassware. Solvents were dried and degassed by standard methods. Supper
dry DCE was purchased from the chemical vendor and used directly without
any treatment. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel
(300–400 mesh). Both starting materials 1(19) and 2(20) are commercially available or are prepared according to the published
methods and have the physical and spectral properties identical to
those earlier reported. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
was performed using glass plates precoated with 200–300 mesh
silica gel impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a 400 MHz spectrometer; chemical shifts are reported in
ppm with the solvent signal as reference and coupling constant (J) is given in hertz. The peak information is described
as: br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet,
comp = composite. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded
on a commercial apparatus [electrospray ionization (ESI) or chemical
ionization source].

General Procedure for the Gold-Catalyzed
Hydroalkoxylation/Povarov
Reaction Cascade of Alkynols 1 with Imines 2 (Schemes 2 and 3)
To a 10 mL oven-dried
vial containing a magnetic stirring bar, imine 2 (0.30
mmol), and [Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] (5.0
mol %, 11.6 mg) in dry DCE (2.0 mL) was added a solution of alkynol 1 (0.30 mmol) in dry DCE (1.0 mL) under an argon atmosphere,
and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 60 °C under
an argon atmosphere. When the reaction was completed (monitored by
TLC), the crude reaction mixture was directly purified by column chromatography
on silica gel (hexane/EtOAc = 15:1–10:1) with additional treatment
to give the pure products 3 or 4 in good
to high yields.

50 mL oven-dried round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring
bar, imine 2a (3.5 mmol, 634 mg), and [Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] (2.0 mol %, 54 mg), was added alkynol 1c (3.5 mmol, 632 mg) in dry DCE (15 mL) via a syringe slowly
under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 60
°C overnight. When the reaction was completed (monitored by TLC),
most of the solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the residue was
purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/EtOAc = 15:1–10:1)
to give 1.063 g of pure product 3c (84% yield).

Preparation
of 7 (Scheme 5)
To a 10 mL vial containing a magnetic
stirring bar and 3 (0.20 mmol) in 1.0 mL of CH3CN, was added 3 M HCl (10.0 equiv) dropwise. The reaction mixture
was stirred at 50 °C for 30 h. After the reaction was completed,
saturated sodium carbonate was added (5.0 mL). The reaction mixture
was extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL × 3), and the combined
organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuo after filtration. The residues
were purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexanes/EtOAc
= 15:1–10:1) to give pure product 7 in moderate
to good yields.

Preparation of 8 (Scheme 6a)
To a 10 mL oven-dried vial containing
a magnetic stirring bar, [Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] (5.0 mol %, 11.6 mg) in dry DCE (2.0 mL) and alkynol 1a (44.0 mg, 0.30 mmol) in dry DCE (1.0 mL) were added in
sequence under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred
at 60 °C for 20 min, and the material was consumed (monitored
by TLC). The crude reaction mixture was purified by flash column chromatography
on silica gel (hexanes/EtOAc = 50:1) to give the pure product 8 in 52% yield.

Control Experiment with 8 (Scheme 6b)
Condition
A: To a 10 mL oven-dried
vial containing a magnetic stirring bar, 2a (36.2 mg,
0.20 mmol) in 1.0 mL of dry DCE and 8 (29.2 mg, 0.20
mmol) in 1.0 mL of DCE were added in sequence under an argon atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight. Then, the
crude reaction mixture was subjected to the proton NMR analysis after
evaporating under vacuum [see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI), the second spectrum] and purified
by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/EtOAc = 15:1–10:1)
to give the pure product 3a in 16% yield.

Condition
B: To a 10 mL oven-dried vial containing a magnetic stirring bar, 2a (36.2 mg, 0.20 mmol), [Au(JohnPhos)(CH3CN)][SbF6] (11.6 mg, 0.015 mmol), 8 (29.2 mg, 0.20 mmol),
and DCE (2.0 mL) were added in sequence under an argon atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight. Then, the
crude reaction mixture was subjected to proton NMR analysis after
evaporating under vacuum (see Figure S1 in the SI, the third spectrum), and purified by column chromatography
on silica gel (hexane/EtOAc = 15:1–10:1) to give the pure product 3a in 54% yield (dr = 10:1).
