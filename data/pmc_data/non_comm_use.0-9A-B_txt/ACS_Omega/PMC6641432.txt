An
efficient palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative ortho-acylation
of anilines with α-oxocarboxylic acids has been realized by
using carbamate as a directing group (DG). The reaction proceeds smoothly
with high regioselectivity to afford diverse acylation products of
aniline derivatives in moderate to good yields under mild conditions.
This transformation exhibits broad substrate scope and highly functional
group tolerance. In addition, the employed DG can be easily removed
to give the corresponding 2-amino aromatic ketones. Importantly, several
transformations of the synthesized ortho-acylated anilines into several
synthetically valuable products have been demonstrated for their utilities.

Introduction
Over the past decades,
transition-metal-catalyzed direct C–H
functionalization with high atom economy has been significantly developed
as one of the most powerful and straightforward strategies to construct
complex target molecules from relatively simple materials.1 Among them, functional group-directed C–H
activation protocols are particularly useful, owing to regioselective
functionalizations of ubiquitous C–H bonds in organic molecules
at the desired positions.2 Nitrogen-containing
heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrimidine, and so forth have proven
to be a subclass of the most efficient directing groups (DGs) in organic
synthesis, but their synthetic utilities were significantly compromised
because of the difficulty in removing or modifying these DGs after
the desired transformations.3 Therefore,
new methods have been developed to exploit a variety of removable
DGs in recent years, thereby making these methods more useful in organic
synthesis.4 For example, phenol carbamates
have been investigated as substrates with removable DGs for many C–H
activation transformations including alkenylation,5 arylation,6 borylation,7 halogenation,8 and
oxygenation.9 Unlike phenol carbamates,
aniline carbamates bearing the intrinsic carbamate functionality as
the potential DGs have been rarely explored in transition-metal-catalyzed
C–H activation reactions.10 In 2014,
the Li group disclosed a Pd-catalyzed ortho-C–H arylation of
aniline carbamates, which was the first investigation by using carbamates
as DGs for sp2 C–H activation (Scheme 1A).11a Later, Moghaddam and co-workers
reported the Pd-catalyzed ortho-halogenation of aniline carbamates
under mild conditions (Scheme 1B).11b Unfortunately, there have
been no other examples, although aniline carbamates have exhibited
great advantages for C–H activation reactions as removable
DGs. Meanwhile, aniline carbamates are crucial structural motifs in
natural products and play important and ubiquitous roles in pharmaceutical12 and therapeutic compounds.13 Thus, synthetically useful methods for the diversified
functionalizations of aniline carbamates via direct C–H activations
are highly desirable.

(B) Pd-Catalyzed ortho-Halogenation of Aniline Carbamates; and (C)
Pd-Catalyzed ortho-C–H Acylation of Aniline Carbamates
On the other hand, transition-metal-catalyzed
ligand-directed ortho-acylation
in arenes using acyl surrogates has attracted intense attention as
a reliable tool at the frontier of acylation chemistry.14 The α-oxocarboxylic acids have been used
to a great extent as convenient acyl sources with remarkable success.15 However, some of the previously used DGs are
difficult to modify or remove.16 Therefore,
the development of a removable DG-assisted acylation is highly demanded.
To the best of our knowledge, the Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative acylation
of sp2 C–H bonds with aniline carbamates as the
DG have never been reported. With a continuation of our interest in
developing more C–H bond activation protocols,17 herein we disclose the first example of the Pd-catalyzed
decarboxylative acylation of anilines with α-oxocarboxylic acids
by using carbamate as a removable DG (Scheme 1C).

Results and Discussion
Our investigation
began with decarboxylative coupling of methyl
phenylcarbamate (1a) with phenylglyoxylic acid (2a, 1.8 equiv) as the model reaction in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol %) and (NH4)2S2O8 (2.0 equiv) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) at 30 °C for
24 h. To our delight, the desired product 3aa was isolated
in 21% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Encouraged by this initial result, we then optimized
the reaction conditions including solvents, oxidants, additives, palladium
catalysts, reaction temperature, and reaction time, and the selected
results are summarized in Table 1. Firstly, solvent screening experiments demonstrated
that dichloromethane (DCM), diglyme, acetonitrile (CH3CN),
dioxane, and toluene were much less efficient than DCE (entries 2–6
vs entry 1). Then, the effectiveness of the oxidant was examined.
Compared to other oxidants such as K2S2O8, Na2S2O8, oxone, BQ, and
Ag2O, (NH4)2S2O8 was the most suitable oxidant in this reaction (entries 7–11
vs entry 1). After that, different sorts of additives had been investigated.
When 0.5 equiv of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) was
added to this reaction, the yield was dramatically improved to 42%
(entry 12). The addition of other additives, such as pivalic acid
(PivOH), d-camphorsulfonic acid (d-CSA), trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid (TfOH), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), to the reaction resulted
in reduced yields of 3aa (entries 13–16 vs entry
12). Next, we examined the influence of the reaction temperature.
Decreasing the temperature to 25 °C suppressed the reaction efficiency
and provided 3aa in 32% yield (entry 17). Increasing
the temperature to 35, 40, or 45 °C led to an improvement of
the yield up to 67% (entries 18–20). However, no better result
could be obtained by further increasing the temperature to 50 and
60 °C (entries 21 and 22). We were pleased to find that the yield
could be improved to 71%, when the amount of PTSA was increased to
0.75 equiv (entry 23). Nevertheless, the yield decreased slightly
as the amount of PTSA was further increased to 1.0 equiv (entry 24).
Subsequently, varying the amount of 2a proved to be fruitless
(entries 25 and 26). Furthermore, the effect of the reaction time
was also studied. The experimental results indicated that shorter
or longer reaction time was not beneficial either (entries 27 and
28). To identify the impact of different kinds of palladium catalysts,
experiments with several palladium salts were performed. The yield
of 3aa was not enhanced with other palladium catalysts
including Pd(TFA)2, Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2, and Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 (entries 29–31
vs entry 23). Finally, we attempted to decrease the catalyst loading
to 5 mol %, and the target product was obtained in only 63% yield
(entry 32). Therefore, the optimized conditions of the Pd-catalyzed
decarboxylative ortho-acylation of 1a with 2a were determined as shown in entry 23.

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we
turned our attention
to investigate the substrate scope of aniline carbamates. As shown
in Table 2, the reactions
proceeded smoothly to afford ortho-acylation products 3aa–pa in moderate to good yields with temperature variations in some cases.
Aniline carbamates 1b and 1c with para-substituted
electron-donating groups (Me and t-Bu) gave the corresponding
products 3ba and 3ca in 53 and 54% yields,
respectively. Halogen-substituted aniline carbamates 1d–f were compatible with our optimal reaction conditions. In particular,
the fluoro-substituted aniline carbamate 1d gave the
corresponding product 3da in 78% yield. It should be
pointed out that the acylation could tolerate the electron-withdrawing
group CF3 at the para-position and provided 3ga in a moderate yield of 51%. To our delight, meta-substituted electron-rich
or electron-deficient aniline carbamates exhibited good regioselectivity
and gave products 3ha–ma in 45–81% yields.
Even the reaction with the iodo-substituted aniline carbamate delivered
the expected product 3la in 61% yield. It is of interest
to note that the halo group in products 3da–fa and 3ia–la may be utilized as the handle for
further functionalization. Unfortunately, ortho-substituted aniline
carbamates failed to provide the desired product under the current
catalyst system, presumably due to the steric hindrance. Moreover,
3,4-disubstituted aniline carbamate 1n was also compatible
and gave the corresponding product 3na in 53% yield.
Furthermore, the methyl carbamate group could be replaced by the ethylcarbamate
group and still afforded a good yield (70%) of 3oa. Additionally,
phenyl phenylcarbamate (1p), a substrate with both phenol
and aniline carbamate functionalities, showed complete selectivity
for functionalization of the aniline moiety (3pa), rather
than the previously established reactivity selectively at the phenol
moiety.6b,18

c Reaction at 60 °C.

To further examine the substrate
scope and limitations, various
α-oxocarboxylic acids were investigated under the optimized
reaction conditions. As shown in Table 3, various α-oxocarboxylic acids containing different
functional groups in the aromatic ring showed good reactivity to give
the corresponding products in moderate to good yields with temperature
variations in some cases. The acylation could tolerate with either
electron-rich or electron-deficient groups including the OMe, Me,
and halogen groups at the para-position, affording the desired products 3ab–ag in 42–60% yields. Similarly, meta-substituted
phenylglyoxylic acids worked well to give the desired products 3ah–am in 50–70% yields. The reaction could
also be extended to ortho-substituted phenylglyoxylic acids to afford 3an–aq in 56–70% yields. When 2-(naphthalene-1-yl)-2-oxoacetic
acid (2r) was employed as the acyl source, the corresponding
product 3ar was obtained in 51% yield. Finally, the disubstituted
phenylglyoxylic acids also proved to be feasible for this procedure
and provided products 3as–au in 50–59%
yields.

c Reaction at 60 °C.

We then explored the synthetic
utility of synthesized ortho-acylated
aniline carbamates; we conducted further transformations of the representative 3aa to provide several synthetically valuable products (Scheme 2). For example, 3aa could react with (ethoxyethynyl)lithium to synthesize
the multifunctionalized indole 4aa in 81% yield.19 Moreover, 3aa could be used to
prepare the NH-free acridone 5aa in 82% yield through
Cu-catalyzed intramolecular C(sp2)–H amination and
simultaneous removal of the DG.20 Subsequently,
the removal of the DGs was examined. By following previously reported
alkaline conditions,21 the removal of the
methyl carbamate group could be realized to produce (2-aminophenyl)(phenyl)methanone
(6aa) in 93% yield. Additionally, ethyl and phenyl carbamate
moieties of 3oa and 3pa could also be removed
efficiently by using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF).22 Furthermore, 6aa could react with
NH4OAc and benzylic C–H bond of toluene to synthesize
2,4-diphenylquinazoline (7aa) in 78% yield under the
KI–TBHP conditions.23 In addition, 6aa could be efficiently transformed to 2-methyl-4-phenylquinoline
(8aa) by reacting with acetone in 92% yield.24

Scheme 2 Removal of the DGs and Transformations of 3aa, 3oa, and 3pa
In order to understand the reaction mechanism
of this transformation,
a radical trapping experiment was explored (Scheme 3). When the radical scavenger 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxide (TEMPO) was added to the reaction system of 1a and 2a under the optimized conditions, only
a trace amount of 3aa was detected; meanwhile the acyl
radical-TEMPO adduct 9 was isolated in 38% yield. This
result indicated that the reaction probably involved a free radical
process. On the basis of the above experimental result and the previous
literature,17d,25 a plausible mechanism for this
Pd-catalyzed C–H acylation is depicted in Scheme 4. At first, this transformation
is believed to start with the formation of a six-membered palladacycle A by the ortho-palladation of 1 with a Pd(II)
species. Then, A undergoes oxidative coupling with the
acyl radical B, which is produced by decarboxylation
of 2 in the presence of (NH4)2S2O8,17d to furnish the
Pd(III) intermediate C.26 The
intermediate C is subsequently oxidized by (NH4)2S2O8 to provide a Pd(IV) intermediate D.26 Finally, the acylated product 3 is generated by reductive elimination of the intermediate D, and a Pd(II) species is released simultaneously to complete
the catalytic cycle.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient
palladium-catalyzed
acylation of anilines with high regioselectivity by utilizing carbamate
as a removable DG via C–H activation strategy. This protocol
can be applied to a wide range of aniline carbamates and α-oxocarboxylic
acids with both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups.
Additionally, this protocol is also compatible with halogen functional
groups, which offer a potential for further structural modification.
Importantly, the synthesized ortho-acylated anilines can be further
converted to indoles and acridones, and the protecting carbamate group
can be easily removed to provide the 2-amino aromatic ketones, which
could be further transformed to quinoline and quinazoline derivatives.

Synthesis and Characterization
of Product 8aa(24)
A mixture of 2-aminophenyl ketone 6aa (394.0 mg, 2.0
mmol) and acetone (0.5 mL) in 20% KOH ethanol
solution (10.0 mL) was refluxed overnight at 85 °C. Then, the
reaction mixture was quenched with hydrochloric acid (1.0 N) and extracted
three times with EtOAc (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic layer
was washed with brine once and dried over Na2SO4. The organic phase was concentrated under vacuum and purified by
a chromatographic column over silica gel using a mixture of petroleum
ether and ethyl acetate(v/v = 10:1–6:1) as the eluent, giving 8aa (404.1 mg, 92%) as a light yellow solid.

Hz, 1H), 2.77 (d, J = 1.2 Hz, 3H).

Trapping Experiment
with TEMPO
A mixture of aniline
carbamate 1a (45.6 mg, 0.30 mmol), phenylglyoxylic acid
(2a) (90.0 mg, 0.54 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (7.0 mg,
0.03 mmol), (NH4)2S2O8 (136.9 mg, 0.6 mmol), PTSA (38.9 mg, 0.225 mmol), and TEMPO (93.7
mg, 0.6 mmol) in DCE (2.0 mL) was stirred at 45 °C for 24 h.
After this, the reaction was cooled to room temperature. Then, the
mixture was filtered through a silica gel plug with ethyl acetate
as the eluent and evaporated in vacuum. Product 9 (54.1
mg, 38% yield based on 2a) was isolated by column chromatography
over silica gel using a mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate
(v/v = 10:1) as the eluent.
