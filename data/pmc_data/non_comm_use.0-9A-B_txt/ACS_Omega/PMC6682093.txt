Environmentally responsive cotton
fabrics were fabricated by dip-coating
ABC miktoarm star terpolymers, which contain reactive poly(3-triisopropyloxysilylpropyl
methacrylate) blocks, hydrophobic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) blocks,
and hydrophilic poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) blocks. The functionalized cotton fabrics
with perfectly alternating PDMS and PDMAEMA blocks show underoil superhydrophobicity
and underwater superoleophobicity. The wettability and permeability
of the functionalized fabrics can be readily adjusted by the contacting
medium. More interestingly, surface reconstruction causes a reduction
in the breakthrough pressure of the nonwetting phase. The adaptive
permeability endows the functionalized cotton fabrics with the capability
to separate heavy oil–water–light oil ternary mixtures.

Introduction
Efficient separation
of oil–water mixtures is a worldwide
environmental challenge due to the frequent oil spills and the increasing
oily wastewater generated from chemical industry and metal finishing.1,2 In membrane filtration processes, surface wettability is crucial
to efficient oil–water separation.3−5 Two types of
special wetting membranes have been intensively investigated in the
past two decades, namely superhydrophobic/superoleophilic and superhydrophilic/underwater
superoleophobic membranes.6−12 However, choosing the appropriate membrane is critical to separating
various oil–water mixtures in order to avoid the membrane being
blocked by the nonpermeable phase.13,14 For example,
the superhydrophobic/oleophilic surfaces is not suitable for separating
mixtures of water and light oil based on gravity separation. When
water is first contacted with the superhydrophobic membrane, the separation
process is hindered, and a specially designed separation apparatus
is needed.

Smart surfaces with switchable wettability have been
reported for
oil–water separation in response to external stimuli such as
pH,15−21 temperature,22−25 light,26 and electric field.27,28 Block copolymers comprising the pH-responsive block were coated
onto different substrates to impart switchable wettability to the
prepared membranes.15−17 For the membrane modified with polydimethylsiloxane-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PDMS-b-P2VP),
the membrane was oleophilic and the oil penetrated the mesh when pretreated
with basic aqueous solution. Conversely, when the fabric was prewetted
with acidic aqueous solution, water was found to penetrate the fabric.17 The protonation and deprotonation of the pyridine
groups altered the polarity of the surface and thus changed the surface
wettability. In addition, switchable wettability triggered by other
stimuli, such as ammonia,21 carbon dioxide,29 stearic acid with solvent30 and temperature,22−24 as well as thermo- and pH dual-responsive25 have been reported. However, the abovementioned
methods require ex situ treatments to trigger the change of surface
wettability, which is inappropriate for successive oil–water
separation. Therefore, in situ wettability switch is highly desirable
to effectively separate complex oil–water mixtures.31 Tuteja and coworkers prepared a novel hygro-responsive
membrane using a mixture of hydrophobic fluorodecyl POSS and hydrophilic
poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate.32 The
membrane surface is superhydrophilic and superoleophobic in air or
under water due to surface reconfiguration caused by the contacting
medium. Liu’s group have developed an innovative janus membrane
for separating oil from oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions where the polyamine-bearing
side causes demulsification, and the PDMS-bearing side selectively
allows oil to pass.33 They further improved
the coating procedure with designed block copolymers and demonstrated
the use of these janus membranes for rapid separation of oil from
various surfactant-stabilized O/W emulsions.34,35

Most studies used simple oil–water mixtures to demonstrate
the separation efficiency, which is quite different from actual oil
spills and industrial wastewater.8 The
challenge of continuously separating heavy oil–water–light
oil ternary mixtures still exists, which is common in actual oil spill
cases.19 Noting that heavy oil refers to
oil with a density greater than water, while light oil refers to oil
with a density less than water. Continuous in situ separation of heavy
oil–water–light oil ternary mixtures provides a new
strategy for handling oil spills. Ju and coworkers fabricated a pH-responsive
surface for the controllable separation of oil–water ternary
mixtures.19 The initial superhydrophobic
membrane allowed the bottom oil layer to penetrate, whereas the water
was retained. The permeation of water through the membrane was then
triggered by adding an aqueous alkaline solution to increase the pH
value of the water phase. Eventually, the light oil was blocked by
the superhydrophilic surface.19 Cao and
coworkers designed a dually prewetted cotton fabric for separating
the oil–water ternary mixtures.36 Fabrics coated with corn straw powder and polyurethane can be wetted
by both oil and water. Oil and water were selectively permeated through
the oil-prewetted area and water-prewetted area, respectively.36 Very recently, a dually prewetted carbon black-coated
PVDF microfiltration membrane has been reported for the continuous
separation of multiphase emulsion mixtures.37

Here, we report the fabrication of an environmentally responsive
cotton fabrics and discuss the use of the functionalized fabrics to
separate complex oil–water mixtures. The environmentally responsive
membrane was prepared by grafting ABC miktoarm star terpolymers onto
cotton fabrics as shown in Figure 1. The designed ABC miktoarm star terpolymers are μ-poly(dimethylsiloxane)-b-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate)-b-poly(3-triisopropyloxysilylpropyl
methacrylate) (μ-PDMS-b-PDMAEMA-b-PIPSMA). The PIPSMA block can form a cross-linked layer on cotton
fabric via sol–gel reaction between the triisopropyloxysilyl
groups and surface hydroxyl groups of cotton. PDMS and PDMAEMA blocks
can then be mounted on cotton fabrics and arranged in a strictly alternating
pattern. The glass-transition temperatures of PDMS and PDMAEMA block
are around −124 and 19 °C, respectively.38,39 A lower glass-transition temperature facilitates surface reconfiguration
induced by the contact medium. In the oil medium, the hydrophobic
PDMS is distributed outside the cotton fabrics, and the hydrophilic
PDMAEMA is segregated into the interior of the shell. These surface
structures will then exhibit hydrophobicity and selectively pass oil
through the membrane. In contrast, in the aqueous medium, the outer
shell of cotton fabrics consists of stretched PDMAEMA chains and collapsed
PDMS chains, and these structures will exhibit hydrophilicity and
preferably pass water through the membrane. We have recently reported
environmentally responsive hairy particles with regulatable surface
wettability for the preparation of tunable Pickering emulsions.40 Liu and coworkers also reported organohydrogels
with reconfigurable heteronetwork structures and adaptive surface
wettability.41 We have demonstrated that
the functionalized cotton fabrics with adaptive permeability can be
used to separate complex oil–water mixtures.

responsive cotton fabrics fabricated

with oil or water.

Results and Discussion
A family of amphiphilic ABC miktoarm star terpolymers consisting
of PDMS, PDMAEMA, and PIPSMA were synthesized according to our previous
reported procedure, as shown in Figure 2.40 Under the click reaction
conditions, the halide groups of the PDMAEMA block will generate radicals,
which will result in undesirable branching and cross-linking.42 Therefore, excessive diethylamine was added
to dehalogenate the PDMAEMA block before click reactions.43 The ABC miktoarm star terpolymers are labeled
as μ-PDMSx-b-PDMAEMAy-b-PIPSMAz (P1, P2, and P3), wherein the subscripts indicate the degree
of polymerization of the respective blocks. Figure 3 shows 1H NMR spectra of μ-PDMSx-b-PDMAEMAy-b-PIPSMAz (P2)
and the peak assignments. The characteristic peak of PDMS is observed
at 0.07 ppm (a) for the protons of the methyl groups (−Si(CH3)−). The peaks at 2.56 (c) and 4.06 ppm (d) are protons
of the methylene group for PDMAEMA. The peaks at 3.87 (h) and 0.55
(g) are attributed to the methylene protons adjacent to the ester
group and silicon of PIPSMA, respectively. Table 1 lists the characteristics of μ-PDMSx-b-PDMAEMAy-b-PIPSMAz miktoarm
star terpolymers. For the three ABC miktoarm star terpolymers P1,
P2, and P3, the PDMS block length is the same (x =
64), and the PDMAEMA block lengths are 42, 121, and 148, respectively.
The surface composition and surface wettability of cotton fabrics
are adjusted by the block length of PDMAEMA.

The interthread pore size of the
cotton fabric used is 60 μm
(Figure S13). To coat the fabric swatches,
a 3 × 3 cm2 sample was immersed in corresponding polymer
solution (30 mg/mL) for 30 min. The sample was withdrawn from the
solution and then heated at 180 °C for 4 h under vacuum. Subsequently,
the fabrics were extracted in tetrahydrofuran (THF) for 8 h using
a Soxhlet extractor to remove unreacted block copolymers. After extraction,
the fabric samples were dried under vacuum for 24 h. The functionalized
cotton fabrics are denoted as P1@CF, P2@CF, and P3@CF. The mass fraction
of the grafted block copolymer in the functionalized cotton fabrics
was determined by gravimetric analysis to be 7–11% (Figure S14, Table S2).

As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
(Figure 4a), the pristine
cotton fabric has a smooth surface. After coating with ABC miktoarm
terpolymers (P3), the surface roughness increases as shown in Figure 4b. The combination
of the SEM image and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis
is a powerful technique for determining the surface composition and
composition distribution.34Figure 4c,d shows the SEM–EDS
images of P3@CF. The yellow dots representing the Si element (Figure 4c), which is belonged
to the PDMS block, are uniformly distributed on the surface of the
fabric. Similarly, the blue dots in Figure 4d representing the N element, which is belonged
to the PDMAEMA block, are also uniformly distributed on the fabric
surface. The merged yellow and blue dots unambiguously support the
successful fabrication of targeted cotton fabric with alternating
hydrophobic PDMS and hydrophilic PDMAEMA. These results are consistent
with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of functionalized cotton
fabrics (Figure S15). Noting that the mixed
polymer brushes with alternative distribution differ from recently
reported V-shape structures.17,34,35,44

and the oil is 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). (h) Underwater oil CA. The
oil is hexane. The scale bars in (a,b) are 20 μm, and the scale
bars in (c,d) are 50 μm.

In air, the hydrophobic PDMS block is distributed outside
the fabric
surface, so the surface initially exhibits hydrophobicity and lipophilicity,
as shown in Figure 4e. Hexane soaks into functionalized cotton fabrics rapidly, and the
water contact angle (CA) is 120°. However, the water CA of the
functionalized fabrics (Figure 4f) gradually decreases over time as compared to the rapid
wetting of the pristine cotton fabrics. The water droplet causes the
hydrophilic PDMAEMA to be exposed to the exterior, and the hydrophobic
PDMS to collapse into the interior to minimize the surface energy.
Because PDMAEMA has a pKa of 8.0,45 the pendant dimethyl groups can be protonated
in deionised (DI) water, which has been confirmed by in situ attenuated
total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR)
spectroscopy analysis (Figure 5a). In hexane, the characteristic 1720 cm–1 band was attributed to the stretching of C=O groups of swelled
PDMAEMA. In DI water, the protonated dimethyl amino group is capable
of forming ring conformation with the carbonyl group through the hydrogen
bond, as shown in Figure 5b. Because of hydrogen bonding, the characteristic band of
the carbonyl group shifts to 1640 cm–1.46 The evolution of the water CA in air clearly
indicates the process of surface reconfiguration and wettability switching
induced by water droplets.32,35 As the volume fraction
of PDMAEMA increases from 49.3% (P1@CF) to 77.4% (P3@CF), the time
to complete wetting was reduced from 38 to 23 min. For longer PDMAEMA
chains, the textured surface can be reconstructed more easily. Because
of surface reconstruction, the functionalized cotton fabrics can be
wetted by both oil and water. As shown in Figure 4g,h, the functionalized fabrics display unusual
underoil superhydrophobic and underwater superoleophobic. The underoil
water CA is 151°, and the underwater oil CA is 152°. Previously,
these dual superlyophobic states were considered to be energetically
unfavorable for a given surface.47 Tian
and coworkers created such a dual superlyophobic surface through the
combination of delicate re-entrant topography and finely matched surface
chemistry.47 However, in our approach,
the dual superlyophobic surface can be constructed by simple dip-coating
of ABC miktoarm star terpolymers. The underwater and underoil wetting
properties for functionalized cotton fabrics coated with P1 and P2
(P1@CF, P2@CF) are shown in Figure S16.
As the PDMAEMA block length increases, the underoil CA decreases slightly,
while the underwater oil CA increases.

The breakthrough pressure
(Pbt) is
an important parameter for gravity-driven oil–water separation,
which is the critical pressure required to force a nonwetting phase
to penetrate a membrane that is infused with a wetting phase.32,48 As shown in the inset photographs in Figure 6, hydrostatic testing has been utilized to
determine the breakthrough height (hbt) of hexane and water. For functionalized cotton fabrics, the hbt of hexane is around 21 cm, and the hbt of water is around 10 cm. These hbt values are higher than the reported hbt of hygro-responsive membranes obtained by dip-coating
fluorodecyl POSS and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, which is around
1.3 cm for water and oil.32 The higher
value of hbt facilitates the oil–water
separation process by increasing the operating height. Accordingly,
the breakthrough pressure can be calculated from the breakthrough
height by Pbt = ρghbt, here ρ is the liquid density and g is the gravitational acceleration. For the functionalized cotton
fabrics, the breakthrough pressure of hexane and water can be well
tuned by adjusting the relative block length of PDMAEMA and PDMS on
the membrane surface as shown in Figure 6a,b. The breakthrough pressure of hexane
on the functionalized cotton fabrics prewetted by water increases
as the block length of PDMAEMA increases. This trend is reasonable
because the longer PDMAEMA block prewetted with water will provide
a stronger barrier to hexane and consequently inhibit hexane penetration.
Conversely, as shown in Figure 6b, the breakthrough pressure of water on the functionalized
cotton fabrics prewetted with hexane decreases as the block length
of PDMAEMA increases. A longer PDMAEMA block length is easier to reach
the coating surface and promote the water penetration, thus reducing
water breakthrough pressure.

Figure 6 (a) Breakthrough pressure of hexane on the functionalized
cotton
fabrics prewetted by water. (b) Breakthrough pressure of water on
the functionalized cotton fabrics prewetted by hexane.

The functionalized cotton fabrics with switchable
wettability can
be applied to separate both light oil–water mixtures and heavy
oil–water mixtures. As shown in Figure 7a and Movie S1, using an oil-prewetted cotton fabrics (P1@CF), 1,2-dichloroethane
(DCE) readily penetrated the functionalized textile, and water was
retained above the membrane. However, when the textile was prewetted
by water, water passed through the membrane, and hexane was retained
(Figure 7b and Movie S2). The adaptive permeability of the textiles
to oil or water makes them useful for different oil–water separation
processes. This multifunctional material has been rarely reported
in terms of selective oil–water separation.32 The efficiency of separation is determined by comparing
the weight of water or oil before and after separation. For dichloroethane–water
mixtures, the separation efficiency for P1@CF is 93.3 ± 4.4%.
For water–hexane mixtures, the separation efficiency for P1@CF
is 97.3 ± 2.5%. They remain highly efficient after 20 cycles,
as shown in Figures S17 and S18.

Figure 7 Photographs
of the oil–water separation experiments, includes
(a) separation of DCE–water, (b) separation of water–hexane.
The figures in (a,b) are block time of the liquid phase related to
the static pressure of the respective liquid column.

More importantly, we have found that the retained
nonwetting phase
below the breakthrough height can also pass through the functionalized
fabrics after a certain block time. In other words, for environmentally
responsive cotton fabrics, the breakthrough height or breakthrough
pressure of the nonwetting phase gradually decreases. For the water
phase with 7.6 cm height (below the breakthrough height) on P1@CF,
the block time is around 4.6 min. After this, water completely pass
through the fabrics. As shown in Figure 7a,b, the block time for water and hexane
decreases drastically as the static pressure of liquid column increases.

For fabrics, the breakthrough pressure (Pbt) is given as  here R is the cylinder radius, D is the half of the intercylinder
spacing, γ12 is the interfacial tension between the
wetting and nonwetting
phases, and θ’ is the CA of the nonwetting liquid droplet
on the fabric surface in the wetting phase.32,49 After the wetting phase passes through the membrane, the nonwetting
phase will begin to contact the membrane surface and cause the surface
reconstruction. Therefore, the CA will decrease as the lipophilic
polymer block accumulates in the surface. From the above equation,
the breakthrough pressure decreases as the CA decreases (Figure S19). Then, when the continuously decreasing
CA approaches a critical value, the nonwetting phase penetrates the
membrane. Both the wetting and nonwetting phase can be infiltrated
through the environmentally responsive cotton fabrics. The block time
of the nonwetting phase to penetrate the membrane is closely related
to the surface composition of cotton fabrics. For example, the block
time of water to pass through cotton fabric prewetted with DCE decreases
as the PDMAEMA block length increases.

Inspired by the Pbt changes caused
by surface reconstruction, we hypothesize that the environmentally
responsive cotton fabrics can be used for the separation of heavy
oil–water–light oil ternary mixtures as shown in Figure 8a. The surface wettability
of such membrane depends on the contact medium, and when the wetting
phase is completely infiltrated and the nonwetting phase begin to
contact the surface, the change in the medium will trigger in situ
wettability switching. When the heavy oil is completely infiltrated
and water begins to contact the membrane, the permeability of the
membrane changes from oil-permeable to water-permeable through surface
reconfiguration induced by the aqueous phase. Similarly, when the
water is completely infiltrated and the light oil begins to contact
the membrane, an inversion from water-permeable to oil-permeable occurs.
Therefore, the environmentally responsive membranes are oil-permeable
when exposed to heavy oils and light oils, and they are water-permeable
when exposed to the aqueous phase without resorting to ex situ stimulus.
As shown in Figure 8b and Movie S3, DCE, water, and hexane
pass through the membrane sequentially. DCE immediately penetrates
the P1@CF membranes, and water and hexane pass through the membrane
with the block time of 17 and 1 min, respectively. For dichloroethane–water–hexane
ternary mixtures, the separation efficiency for P1@CF in the first
stage is 93.7 ± 1.3%, and the separation efficiency in the second
stage is 99.4 ± 0.2%. They remain highly efficient after 10 cycles,
as shown in Figure 9.

oil ternary mixtures using an environmentally responsive membrane.

by comparing the weight of water or oil before and after separation.

Conclusions
In summary, environmentally
responsive cotton fabrics were fabricated
by a simple sol–gel reaction between the triisopropyloxysilyl
groups of the ABC miktoarm terpolymer and the surface hydroxyl group
of cotton. The wettability and permeability of the functionalized
fabrics can be regulated by the contacting medium. The functionalized
cotton fabrics shows underoil superhydrophobicity and underwater superoleophobicity.
In addition, the breakthrough pressure of these fabrics can be finely
adjusted by changing the volume fraction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
blocks. More importantly, the breakthrough pressure decreases as the
contact time with the nonwetting phase increases. We have demonstrated
that this environmentally responsive fabric can be used to separate
heavy oil–water–light oil ternary mixtures. Combined
with the demulsification capability by coating this polymer onto membranes
with smaller pores, the environmentally responsive membranes may find
practical applications in the separation of complex oil–water
mixtures.50

Synthesis of ABC Miktoarm Star Terpolymers: μ-Poly(dimethylsiloxane)-b-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate)-b-poly(3-triisopropyloxysilylpropyl
methacrylate) (μ-PDMS-b-PDMAEMA-b-PIPSMA)
μ-PDMS-b-PDMAMEA-b-PIPSMA miktoarm star terpolymers were synthesized according
to our previously reported procedure, as shown in Figure 2.40 Azide-functionalized PDMS [PDMS-(OH, N3)] (1) was synthesized according to the literature with a slight modification.52 In a typical experiment, epoxide-terminated
PDMS (15.5284 g, 3.1 mmol) was dissolved in isopropanol (75 mL), and
then an aqueous solution of NaN3 (1.0093 g, 15.5 mmol)
was added. The solution was adjusted to pH = 6.0 with glacial acetic
acid. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C until the 1H NMR signal of the starting material disappeared. After the
reaction finished, hexane was added, followed by successively washing
with saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3, H2O, and saturated NaCl solution. The organic layer was dried over
anhydrous MgSO4 and then concentrated on a rotary evaporator
and dried under vacuum overnight at room temperature.

The α-alkynyl-ω-bromo-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (alkynyl-PDMAEMA-Br)
was obtained by ATRP of DMAEMA, according to the literature with some
modification.53 The functional ATRP initiator
propargyl 2-bromoisobutyrate (PBIB) was first prepared according to
a method reported by Matyjaszewski.54 Subsequently,
in a typical procedure, PBIB (243.4 mg, 1.187 mmol), DMAEMA (20 mL,
118.7 mmol), HMTETA (273.5 mg, 1.187 mmol), and CuBr (170.3 mg, 1.187
mmol) were dissolved in a 20 mL anisole in a Schlenk tube. After three
freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the Schlenk tube was sealed
off, and the reaction mixture was allowed to proceed at 30 °C
for 4.5 h. The reaction mixture was quickly cooled and diluted with
THF. The copper salt was removed by passing through a neutral aluminum
oxide column. After concentrating on a rotary evaporator, the mixture
was precipitated into cold hexane. The product was purified by reprecipitation
twice from THF to cold hexane and dried under vacuum overnight at
40 °C. (Yield: 64.7%).

The α-alkynyl-ω-diethylamino-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (alkynyl-PDMAEMA-N(Et)2) (2) was obtained by dehalogenation of alkynyl-PDMAEMA-Br
with excess of diethylamine. In a typical experiment, alkynyl-PDMAEMA-Br
(11.90 g, 0.459 mmol), diethylamine (3.36 g, 45.9 mmol), and dimethylformamide
(DMF) (100 mL) were sequentially added to a 250 mL round-bottomed
flask and stirred at 80 °C for 36 h. DMF was removed by rotary
evaporation, and the resulting crude product was dissolved in THF
and precipitated in cold hexane. This step was repeated three times
and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C to give the brown product
alkynyl-PDMAEMA-N(Et)2 (8.20 g, 68.7%).

The poly(dimethylsiloxane)-(OH)-b-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate) (PDMS-(OH)-b-PDMAMEA) (3) diblock copolymer containing
a hydroxyl group at the junction point was synthesized by the click
reaction between 1 and 2. The diblock copolymer
macroinitiatiors, namely PDMS-(Br)-b-PDMAEMA, were
synthesized by the esterification reaction of PDMS-(OH)-b-PDMAMEA (3) with 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide in pyridine.
In a typical run, PDMS-(OH)-b-PDMAEMA (6.80 g, 0.220
mmol), DMAP (0.0671 g, 0.439 mmol), TEA (0.3558 g, 3.515 mmol), and
anhydrous pyridine (200 mL) were sequentially added to a 250 mL three-necked
round-bottomed flask, and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere. Bromoisobutyryl
bromide (0.7578 g, 3.296 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C, followed
by stirring for 48 h. The pyridine was removed by rotary evaporation,
and the residue was dissolved with THF and then precipitated in cold
hexane. The yellow product was purified by reprecipitating twice from
THF to cold hexane and dried under vacuum at 40 °C overnight.
(3.90 g, 56.9%).

μ-PDMS-b-PDMAMEA-b-PIPSMA
ABC miktoarm terpolymers were synthesized by ATRP polymerization of
IPSMA using PDMS-(Br)-b-PDMAEMA as the initiator.
In a typical run, PDMS-(Br)-b-PDMAEMA (1.00 g, 0.032
mmol), IPSMA (0.3464 g, 0.962 mmol), isopropyl alcohol (3.0 mL), PMDETA
(6.1 mg, 0.032 mmol), and CuBr (5.1 mg, 0.032 mmol) were sequentially
added into a Schlenk tube. After three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles, the Schlenk tube was sealed off, and the reaction mixture
was allowed to proceed at 50 °C for about 12 h. The reaction
mixture was quickly cooled and diluted with THF. The copper salt was
removed by passing through a neutral aluminum oxide column. After
concentrating on a rotary evaporator, the mixture was precipitated
into cold hexane. The product was purified by reprecipitating twice
from THF to cold hexane and dried under vacuum at room temperature
overnight. (Yield: 64.6%).

Cotton Coating
The coating procedure
was carried out
according to the literature.31 To coat
fabric samples, swatches at 3 × 3 cm2 were dipped
into the respective polymer solutions (30 mg/mL) for 30 min. The swatches
were withdrawn from the solution and heated at 180 °C for 4 h
under vacuum. Subsequently, fabrics were extracted with a Soxhlet
extractor in THF for 8 h. After extraction, the fabric samples were
dried under vacuum for 24 h. The mass fraction of grafted block copolymers
was determined by gravimetric analysis and thermogravimetric analysis.

ternary mixtures were investigated in this work. These oils were tinted
with oil red. A 45 mL volume of the heavy oil–water–light
oil ternary mixtures (volume ratio = 1:1:1) was added to an upper
glass tube before contacting with the prewetted membrane. The separation
process was driven only by gravity.

Characterization
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
was used to measure the polydispersity index (PDI) of all the polymers.
The SEC was equipped with a Waters 2414 refractive index detector
and a Waters 515 high-performance liquid chromatography pump. THF
was used as the eluent, and the flow rate is 1.0 mL/min. The molecular
weight and PDI were calculated using monodispersed polystyrene as
the calibration standard. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 NMR spectrometer. SEM observations were
performed using Zeiss EVO 18 operating at 10 kV. XPS spectra were
obtained on a Thermo Fisher Scientific spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi)
with a micro-focused raster-scanned X-ray beam. The take-off angle
is 90°. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 70 FTIR
spectrometer. CAs of water or oil droplets (5.0 μL) were measured
on a Data Physics OCA 20 instrument. Atleast five different points
on the samples were measured.
