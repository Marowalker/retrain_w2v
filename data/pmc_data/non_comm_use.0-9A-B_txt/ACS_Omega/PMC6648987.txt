Here, we show the effect of water–organic
(acetone, tert-butyl alcohol, and isopropanol) cosolvents
on nucleation
and anisotropic crystal growth of solution-synthesized ZnO nanowires.
The addition of organic solution does not alter the face-selective
crystal growth nature but significantly promotes the crystal growth
of both length and diameter of the nanowires. Systematic investigations
reveal that a variation of the relative dielectric constant in the
cosolvent can rigorously explain the observed effect of the water–organic
cosolvent on the ZnO nanowire growth via the degree of supersaturation
for the nucleation. The difference between acetone, tert-butyl alcohol, and isopropanol on the cosolvent effect can be interpreted
in terms of a local solvent-sorting effect.

Introduction
Single crystalline metal oxide nanowires
(e.g., ZnO, TiO2, and WO3) grown by a low-temperature
solution synthesis
have been spotlighted in both fundamental science and device applications1−7 due to the attractive features of metal oxides such as thermal/chemical
stabilities in air/water8 and various functionalities
(e.g., wide bandgap, piezoelectricity, photocatalytic effect, and
electrochromism).9−12 The most remarkable feature of the solution synthesis is that the
fabrication process can be operated at temperatures less than 100
°C,13 which is hardly attainable for
a high-temperature vapor-phase nanowire synthesis.14,15 To date, the solution-based nanowire growths have been intensively
investigated and various strategies using the counter ions,16 the ligand-exchange effect,17 and the surfactant-induced surface capping18−20 have been successfully demonstrated to tailor the nanowire growth
together with an in-depth understanding of the crystal growth mechanism.
These solution-based nanowire syntheses normally employ water-soluble
chemicals.1−12,16−20 The use of a water–organic cosolvent (e.g.,
acetone and alcohol) is one promising way to expand the range of available
chemical reagents by increasing the solubility of water-insoluble
chemicals.21,22 This would open up a new strategy
to design the nanowire growth with the functional properties of organic
chemical reagents. There are many reports as for the synthesis of
metal oxide nanostructures in organic solvents and water–organic
and organic–organic cosolvents, and the significant changes
in their morphologies were demonstrated by using different solvents.23−26 However, the nanowire growth in a water–organic cosolvent
is poorly understood because of the inherent difficulties in understanding
the role of the organic solvent by eliminating the concomitant pressure
variation and in evaluating the complex chemical interactions between
the solutes and solvents. For example, the pressure inside the autoclave
system is varied when using different organic solvents and mixing
ratios in the conventional hydrothermal and solvothermal growths.
Furthermore, the growth parameters such as pH values and concentrations
of the ionic species, which give important information to understand
the crystal growth mechanism in the water system, are ambiguous in
the water–organic cosolvent system. These issues should be
overcome to explore the growth mechanism of metal oxide nanowires
in the water–organic cosolvent. In our previous study, we investigated
the solution growth of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires on a viewpoint of
nucleation phenomena and successfully explained their anisotropic
crystal growth mechanism via a competition of nucleation events on
the (0001) plane and (101̅0) plane.27 These findings clearly show that an analytical approach based on
the nucleation theory gives us lots of important information for understanding
the solution-based nanowire growths, as primarily demonstrated in
the vapor-phase nanowire synthesis.14,15,28,29 Because this approach
is independent from the properties of employed chemical reagents,
it considerably helps to understand the nanowire growth in the water–organic
cosolvent.

Here, we investigate the solution based synthesis
of ZnO nanowires
in various water–organic cosolvents (e.g., acetone, tert-butyl alcohol, and isopropanol) by systematically varying
their mixing ratio. In order to eliminate the pressure change in different
water–organic cosolvent systems, we employed the open growth
system in this study, which is different from a conventional closed
system like autoclave.23−26 On the basis of the nucleation theory, we discuss the effects of
an organic solvent in terms of the critical nucleation concentration,
the temperature change, the liquid–solid interfacial energy,
and the solubility related supersaturation.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of
ZnO nanowires grown in the water–acetone cosolvent when varying
the mixing ratio. The Zn concentration of 25 mM was first prepared
in 100 mL water prior to the acetone addition, and therefore the concentration
of the Zn precursor in the solution was diluted by the addition of
acetone. We found that both the length and the diameter of ZnO nanowires
tended to increase when increasing the amount of acetone addition.
These trends can be more clearly seen in Figure 1b, statistically analyzed length and diameter
data of ZnO nanowires as a function of the amount of acetone addition.
The acetone addition promotes the crystal growths on both (0001) and
(101̅0) planes. Note that the increase of Zn concentration via
evaporation of the water–organic cosolvent can be neglected
because the remaining solvent volume was not less than that of used
water after the growth. Figure 2a shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of ZnO nanowires grown in the water (acetone 0 mL) or water–acetone
(acetone 50 mL) cosolvent. There is no significant difference between
the two in the surface structure, the single crystallinity, and the
growth orientation along [0001]. The preserved growth orientation
along [0001] was also confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data
shown in Figure 2b. Figure 2c shows the room
temperature photoluminescence (PL) data of the ZnO nanowires grown
in both water-based and water–acetone mixed solvents. Only
a slight change in the intensity of the defect-related peak was observed
around 610 nm by the acetone addition, and any other variation of
optical properties was not seen as the wavelengths of both the near-band-edge
(NBE) emission peak and the defect-related peak were maintained. Thus,
the acetone addition does not significantly modify the properties
of ZnO nanowires within the range of current experiments.

controlled to be 25 mM in water prior to the acetone addition.

Next, we focus on a nucleation
phenomenon to examine the effect
of acetone addition on the ZnO nanowire growths by varying the Zn
concentration. Previously our study revealed that there are two different
critical concentrations of the Zn precursor for initiating a nucleation
on both (0001) and (101̅0) planes of ZnO nanowires.27 The critical concentration for the (0001) plane
is always lower than that of the (101̅0) plane, which is an
essential requirement for an anisotropic nanowire growth. Measuring
the two critical concentrations enables to evaluate the contribution
of acetone addition on the initial nucleation on each plane. Figure 3 shows (a) the representative
FESEM images, statistically analyzed (b) length, and (c) diameter
data of ZnO nanowires grown in the water (acetone 0 mL) or water–acetone
(acetone 50 mL) cosolvent by varying the Zn concentration. As can
be seen, the acetone addition similarly lowers the critical concentrations
of both (0001) and (101̅0) planes, which are marked as triangle
symbols in the figures. Thus, the observed acetone addition effect
on the nucleation event is not a face-selective event.

in water-based (acetone 0 mL: upper) and water–acetone mixed
(acetone 50 mL: lower) solvents with varying Zn concentrations (Zn

and (c) diameter of ZnO nanowires grown in water-based (acetone 0
mL: grey) and water–acetone mixed (acetone 50 mL: green &
pink) solvents with varying Zn concentrations. The Zn concentration
conditions marked with triangle symbols indicate the critical concentrations
for nucleation. The Zn concentrations of all samples were calculated
prior to the acetone addition.

On the basis of the two dimensional nucleation theory, the
rate
of crystal growth J can be described as the following equation: , where γ is the interfacial energy
at the liquid–solid interface, Δμ is the degree
of supersaturation and T is the temperature, respectively.29 According to this, we consider the following
three factors including (i) a growth temperature, (ii) an interfacial
energy, and (iii) a supersaturation. First, we consider the temperature
variation of the growth solution by acetone addition. Figure 4a shows the monitored temperatures
of growth solutions during the nanowire growth process. The maximum
temperature of 50 mL acetone mixed solvent was 10 °C higher than
that of the water solvent. However, this effect was found to be negligible
as confirmed by the experiments when increasing the growth temperature
in (Figure 4b). Next,
we consider the change of interfacial energy at the solvent/ZnO interface
by acetone addition because the crystal growth must be promoted with
decreasing the interfacial energy γ. To examine the acetone-induced
variation of interfacial energy at the solvent/ZnO interface, we measured
the contact angle (CA) of the water–acetone cosolvent on the
ZnO surface with varying the amount of acetone addition, as shown
in Figure 5a (a snapshot
of the solvent (water/acetone = 50:50%)/ZnO interface and (b) variation
of CA with varying the acetone ratio). We found that the CA of the
water–acetone cosolvent increased from 24.6° to 33.3°
when we varied the acetone ratio in the water–acetone cosolvent
from 0 to 50%, and further increase of the acetone ratio resulted
in the decrease of the CA. Typically, the CA θ is expressed
by the following equation: cos θ = (γSV –
γLS)/γVL, where γSV, γLS, and γVL are interfacial
free energies at solid–vapor, liquid–solid, and vapor–solid
interfaces, respectively.27 Because γVL should monotonically decrease with increasing acetone ratio
due to the lower surface energy of acetone than water, the observed
trend of CA at low acetone mixing ratios must be caused by the increase
of solvent/ZnO interfacial energy γLS. This should
lead to the suppression of crystal growth. Therefore, the observed
acetone addition effect in Figures 1 and 3 cannot be explained in
terms of the change of interfacial energy. Finally, we discuss the
remaining possible factor for enhancing the crystal growth that is
the supersaturation. Because the solubility of ionic substances is
strongly dependent on an electrostatic interaction with the solvent,32 a decrease of the relative dielectric constant
in a growth solution may increase the degree of supersaturation of
the ionic precursor. Especially in the case of the water–acetone
cosolvent, the relative dielectric constant of the growth solution
should decrease by increasing the acetone ratio due to the smaller
relative dielectric constant of acetone than that of water (acetone:
20.7, water: 78.3 at 25 °C). This might decrease the solubility
of Zn-related ionic species, which increases the degree of supersaturation. Figure 6 shows (a) the representative
FESEM images, statistically analyzed (b) length, and (c) diameter
data of ZnO nanowires grown in water–acetone cosolvents, displayed
as a function of the relative dielectric constant of the solvent.
As a comparison, the results of water–tert-butyl alcohol and water–isopropanol cosolvents are also shown.
In these experiments, the Zn concentration of 3 mM was employed to
clearly observe the effects of organic addition. In Figure 6, the clear relative dielectric
constant dependences on ZnO nanowire growth were commonly observed
in both length and diameter data for all cosolvent systems. These
results are consistent with the prediction based on the solubility-induced
change in the degree of supersaturation and therefore indicate the
validity of the model. It is worth noting that the observed trends
were contradictory to the previous study conducted using an autoclave
by Wen et al. of which the ZnO crystal growth on the (0001) plane
was suppressed with increasing the water ratio in the water–ethanol
cosolvent,23 implying that our results
were obtained as a consequence of eliminating the pressure change.

solvents. The values of the relative dielectric constant of solution
(ε) are also shown. (c,d) Statistically analyzed data of (c)
length and (d) diameter of ZnO nanowires grown in various water–organic
mixed solvents (acetone, tert-butyl alcohol, and
isopropanol) as a function of the relative dielectric constant of
solution. The Zn concentrations of all samples were controlled to
be 3 mM in water prior to the addition of the organic solvent.

Furthermore, we found that the
relative dielectric constant dependence
becomes stronger in the following order: tert-butyl
alcohol ≈ isopropanol > acetone. The weaker relative dielectric
constant dependence in the water–acetone cosolvent is plausibly
because of the formation of the local high relative dielectric constant
field around the metal ions by the so-called as “solvent sorting
effect”.33,34 Water molecules preferentially
interact with metal ions rather than interact with organic solvent
molecules the local concentration of water molecules around the metal
ions and increase if the hydration energy of the organic solvent molecule
is sufficiently low. The increased water concentration increases the
solubility of the ionic substance, leading to the decrease of the
degree of supersaturation. Considering the lower hydration energy
of acetone (45.6 kJ/mol) than tert-butyl alcohol
(60.4 kJ/mol), and isopropanol (56.3 kJ/mol),35 the larger solvent sorting effect would be expected in the water–acetone
cosolvent. In fact, a smaller solvent sorting effect in the water–alcohol
cosolvent than in the water–acetone cosolvent was reported.33 Thus, these results consistently highlight the
crucial importance of the relative dielectric constant of the solvent
for the nucleation event on ZnO nanowire growths in water–organic
cosolvents.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the effect
of water–organic
(acetone, tert-butyl alcohol and isopropanol) cosolvents
on solution-based ZnO nanowire growth. The crystal growths of both
length and diameter of nanowires were promoted by the addition of
the organic solvent while the crystal growth nature and the optical
properties of ZnO nanowires did not alter. We found that a variation
of the relative dielectric constant in cosolvents critically determines
the growth regime of ZnO nanowires. In addition, the so-called “solvent-sorting
effect” is essential to understand the difference between different
organic solvents. This fundamental knowledge as to the effect of water–organic
cosolvents will be a foundation to incorporate the water-insoluble
chemicals into the nanowire and to synthesize novel inorganic–organic
hybrid functional nanowires by simultaneously using water-compatible
and organic-compatible chemical reagents.

Experimental Section
Solution based ZnO nanowire growth was performed using the water–organic
cosolvent in an open system. For a growth substrate, a ZnO seed layer
with a thickness of 50 nm was deposited onto the 20 mm × 20 mm
SiO2/Si substrate by radio frequency (rf) sputtering with
a 50 W of rf power and 0.3 Pa of Ar pressure at room temperature.
A thin Ti layer was inserted between the ZnO seed layer and the substrate
to improve the adhesion. The growth solution of ZnO nanowires was
prepared by dissolving equimolar hexamethylenetetramine and zinc nitrate
hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O)
in 100 mL deionized (DI) water by stirring, followed by the addition
of organic solvents (acetone, tert-butyl alcohol,
and isopropanol). The substrates with the ZnO seed layer were immersed
into the growth solution in a manner of upside down. The beaker was
then capped by a plastic wrap with small holes, which allowed us to
maintain the pressure of the growth system constant by releasing the
evaporated organic solvent during the growth process. The release
of the evaporated organic solvent was delayed by re-condensing the
solvents on the plastic wrap and dropping them into the growth solution.
The nanowire growth was conducted for 20 h at 95 °C of the programmed
oven temperature. To evaluate the effect of organic addition on temperature
variation of the growth solution, the practical temperature of the
growth solution was monitored during the growth process. Also an influence
of the growth temperature on the crystal growth of ZnO nanowires was
examined by varying the programmed oven temperature. After the nanowire
growth, the samples were rinsed by DI water and blown by dry air.
The relative dielectric constant values of water–organic cosolvents
referred to the previous study.30,31 The morphology, the
crystal structure, and the defect property of fabricated ZnO nanowires
were characterized by FESEM (JEOL JSM-7610F) at an acceleration voltage
of 15 kV, TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV,
XRD (Rigaku RINT-TTR III) and room temperature PL spectroscopy (JASCO
FP-8500). The length and the diameter of ZnO nanowires were calculated
by averaging 100 nanowires in FESEM images. To evaluate a variation
of interfacial energy at the solvent/ZnO interface, the static CA
of water–organic mixed solvent was measured on a single crystalline
ZnO (0001) substrate by changing the mixing ratio of the organic solvent.
The CA was measured at 10 s after dropping the solvent.
