were designed and synthesized. DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN were obtained
by rupturing the covalent bond of phenanthrimidazole core to prevent
aggregation-induced quenching. In DDIBPPIN, naphthonitrile group was
incorporated into azomethine nitrogen of phenanthrimidazole to enhance
charge-transfer ability. The DDIBPPIN/CBP:DDIBPPIN-based device shows

Introduction
Efficient blue organic
light-emitting diode (OLED) materials with
substantial efficiency have been taken as a big alternative step to
enhance the commercialization OLEDs.1−3 Blue
emission with Commission International de l'Eclairage ((CIE); y < 0.08) was demanded by National Television System
Committee (NTSC) and CIE (y < 0.06) by European
Broadcasting Union (EBU).4 By energy transfer
to a suitable emissive dopant, blue emitters were employed as hosts
for red/green/white phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs).5,6 The luminous efficiency of blue devices is far behind that of red/green
devices due to wider Eg resulting in contradictory
optoelectronic properties.3 The wider band
gap (>3.0 eV) renders limited π-conjugation and confines
the
molecular size, which in turn decrease the thermal stability of the
materials.5,7 A highly rigid molecular geometry is required
for efficient blue luminescence, which makes it hard for a molecule
to form uniform amorphous thin film with stable morphology.8 Phenanthrimidazole derivatives are utilized as
potential blue emitters due to their high thermal stability, easy
synthesis, bipolar properties, high photoluminescence efficiency,
and restricted π-conjugation.3 To
enhance the fluorescence yield, the two-in-one methodology was adopted:
two indistinguishable fluorophores are connected with spacer, the
increase of conjugation leads to red shift with broadening of emission
spectra.5 Because of large conjugation,
BPPI (4,4′- bis(1-phenyl-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazol-2-yl)biphenyl) exhibits blue emission with poor color purity
(CIE: 0.15, 0.21) compared to NTSC and EBU standards.6,9 Because of poor transportation, the rolloff efficiency with low
exciton utilization efficiency (ηs) was obtained
with BPPI. Bulky side capping in bisphenantro[9,10-d]imidazole increased the hole transportation, while electron transportation
results in deep blue emission with remarkably suppressed red shift
in solid state.8,10 To enhance the color purity and
balanced carrier transportation, we have designed (E)-2-(2-4-(1-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-4,5-diphenyl-H-imidazole-2-yl)-[1,1-biphenyl]-4-yl)vinyl-1-yl (naphthalene-1-yl)-1H-phenanthro
[9,10-d]imidazole (DDIBNPPI) and (E)-4-(2-(2-(-4′-1(2,3-dihyderobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole-2-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)vinyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole-1-yl)-1-napthronitrile
(DDIBPPIN) by reducing the rigidity of phenanthrimidazole to minimize
conjugation (Scheme 1). Compared to bisphenanthrimidazole derivatives, these twisted molecules
DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN with styryl and phenyl linkage increase the
molecular distortion and show excellent photophysical with electrical
properties. The side-capping of cyanonaphthyl at azomethine nitrogen
of phenanthrimidazole restrains the aggregation-enhanced solubility
and color purity. These blue emitters having effective transport characteristics
were employed as a host for red (R)/green (G) and white PHOLEDs due
to their higher ET (triplet energy). The
green/red device based on DDIBPPIN:Ir(ppy)3/DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) exhibits maximum L of 69 906/69 889 cd/m2, ηex of 17.9/19.6%, ηc of
59.8/34.6 cd/A, and ηp of 63.6/35.8 lm/W (CIE: 0.30,0.60)/0.60,0.39).
The white PHOLED with DDIBPPIN:Ir(PPy)3 (0.4% dopant concentration)
shows maximum efficiencies.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN
Results and Discussion
The synthetic
routes of bromo-phenanthroimidazoles (BSNPPI and
BSPINN), styryl-4- biphenylaldehyde phenanthroimidazoles (SBPNPI and
SBPPINC), and emissive materials (DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN) are displayed
in Scheme 1.11

The final products were confirmed in detail
by elemental analysis,
NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. As depicted in Figure 1, cyanonaphthyl in phenanthrimidazole
core improved the charge-transfer (CT) character; as a result, the
effective reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) enhanced the singlet
generation.12 Additional styryl/phenyl
fragments in between the two different imidazole core units enhanced
the state to balance CT state, leading to high quantum yield (ϕPL).13 Clipping strategy between
two imidazole core is beneficial to minimize aggregation leading to
color purity. Incorporation of side-capping dihydrobenzodioxin moiety
in diphenylimidazole enhanced the degree of molecular distortion and
suppressed the formation of aggregation or π–π
stacking in film state, which result in amorphous film during fabrication.

characterization of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN was analyzed in solution
[dichloromethane (10–5 M)] and film (Figure 2 and Table 1).14

The strong
and sharp absorption (λab) band around
249 nm is attributed to π–π* delocalized electronic
transition in imidazole ring. The absorption band from 305 to 358
nm is caused by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from electron–donor
to electron–acceptor unit: on comparison with parent compounds
(SBPNPI and SBPPINC), the title compounds DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN are
blue-shifted and the higher extinction coefficient [251 nm (εmax = 39 840 cm–1 M–1) and 249 nm (εmax = 40 160 cm–1 M–1)] is attributed to extended conjugation (Figure 2).15,16 The full width half-maximum (FWHM) of DDIBPPIN (22 nm) is sharp
and narrower compared to DDIBNPPI (30 nm) due to decreased CT of DDIBNPPI
in S1 level. The absorption (λab) at 253 nm (DDIBNPPI)
and 251 nm (DDIBPPIN) shows weak π–π* intermolecular
stacking.17 The photoluminescence (PL)
spectra of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN in solution/film show emission maxima
at 430/436 and 420/429 nm, respectively (Figure 2).

The observed solvatochromic red
shifts of 52 nm (DDIBNPPI) and
39 nm (DDIBPPIN) predict that the low-lying excited CT state has larger
dipole moment (μ) (Figure S1).18 Further, the red-shifted emission could be from
their twisted conformation, in which the charge transfer from donor
to acceptor zone is easier (Tables S1 and S2). The ICT is confirmed by molecular electrostatic potential (MEP)
analysis (Figure 1).
The gradually widened red-shifted PL spectra with increasing polarity
reflects the strong CT component of excited state (Sn) compared to ground state (S0).19 The emission of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN films at 436 and
429 nm with FWHM is around 48 nm. This is helpful for obtaining saturated
color with good CIE coordinates in OLEDs, and the phenanthrimidazole
derivatives could be the perfect building unit for designing deep
blue emitters. The red shift is attributed to change in excited-state
configuration and cannot be due to aggregation in film. The small
red shift of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN films compared to their solution
shows suppressed π–π* stacking.20 The blue-shifted emission of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN compared
to their parent compounds is in disagreement with expected observation,
i.e., extended π-conjugation leads to red-shifted emission.
The strong overlap of UV spectra with PL spectra indicates the enhanced
light-emitting (LE) component in DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN than their
parent compounds.

Solvatochromism—Lippert-Mataga Plot
[SI-I]
With
increasing solvent polarity, the DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN show red-shifted
emission because of CT (Figure 3 and Tables S1 and S2): the observed
nonlinearity in low- and high-polar media supports the presence of
locally excited state (LE) and charge-transfer excited state (CT),
and the calculated μg (μS0) and
μe (μS1) are: DDIBNPPI (μg = 5.87 D; μe = 22.6 D) and DDIBPPIN (μg = 9.8D; μe = 23.5D).21 The large μe is in close to that of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzonitrile (23.0 D),
which confirmed the hybridization of LE and CT characters of DDIBNPPI
and DDIBPPIN: strong contribution from LE in low polar solvent and
strong contribution from CT in high-polar solvent.22 The low-temperature fluorescence/phosphorescence spectra
of DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN show peaks at 429/399 and 478/473 nm (Figure 2), and the calculated
singlet (ES)/triplet (ET) energies of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN are −2.9/2.58
and 3.1/2.62 eV, respectively. The high ET is sufficient to sensitize the dopants with ET < 2.3 eV. The observed higher quantum yields of DDIBNPPI
(0.90/0.86) and DDIBPPIN (0.96/0.89) in solution/film state (Table 1) are due to lesser
% of nonradiative (knr) contribution due
to stabilized molecular interactions, which are required for efficient
blue OLEDs.23 Because of bulky fragments
at C2 and N1 positions, DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN adopt twisted configuration
in solid due to steric hindrance, which results in less aggregation
leading to lower quantum yield compared to solution. However, the
high solid-state quantum yield of these compounds benefits from the
twisted molecular conformation and supports the suitability of these
materials to use as nondoped emissive materials in OLEDs.

plot; (b) lifetime spectra; (c) thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) images (inset: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)

DDIBPPIN.

Transient Fluorescence
Decay Analysis
The single exponential
lifetimes of 2.61 ns for DDIBNPPI and 2.53 ns for DDIBPPIN in dichloromethane
solution show that the LE and CT states are in hybridized state.24 The contribution of radiative and nonradiative
processes was investigated by kr (radiative)
and knr (nonradiative) decay constants: kr = τ/Φ: 3.4 s–1 (DDIBNPPI) and 3.7 s–1 (DDIBPPIN); knr = τ/(1 – Φ): 0.38 s–1 (DDIBNPPI) and 0.15 s–1 (DDIBPPIN) (Figure 3 and Table 1): higher kr and
smaller knr of DDIBPPIN than those of
DDIBNPPI result in enhanced ηPL.

Thermal and
Electrochemical Characterization
The bulky
fragments at C2 and N1 positions of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN increased
their thermal stability due to enlarged size, which was confirmed
by high decomposition temperature (Td,
5% weight loss) determined through thermogravimetric analysis [Td = 482/496 °C: DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN]. The
high Td reveals that DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN
are stable for fabrication by vacuum thermal coating process (Table 1 and Figure 3). Both compounds show high
glass-transition temperature (Tg = 192/201
°C: DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN). The improved Tg was probably due to the interaction of substituent at C2 and N1
of phenanthrimidazole core, which results in more condensed packing
and improves their morphological stability, i.e., formation of stable
amorphous film, reduces phase separation upon heating, and enhances
lifetime of devices, which is highly important for OLEDs. The morphological
stability of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN for fabrication of OLEDs was discussed
by AFM measurement (30 and 90 °C for 12 h). The RMS values of
DDIBNPPI (0.28 nm) and DDIBPPIN (0.31 nm) thin-film surface reveal
no remarkable surface modification change before and after annealing
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 (a) Hole-only
and electron-only DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN devices;
(b) energy-level arrangement of materials in nondoped devices; and
(c) (i) carrier trapping at Ir(ppy)3 and (ii) carrier hopping
through both Ir(ppy)3 and DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN.

Based on the onset potentials of DDIBPPIN (+0.84 V) and DDIBNPPI
(+0.91 V), EHOMO = Eox + 4.8 eV was calculated (ferrocene, −4.8 eV) as −5.71
eV for DDIBNPPI and −5.64 eV for DDIBPPIN. The ELUMO values of DDIBNPPI (−2.50 eV) and DDIBPPIN
(−2.62 eV) match well with the electron-transporting material
(ETM) (bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridine]beryllium (LUMO = −2.6
eV), suggesting that they may be used as ETM for OLEDs and also as
emissive materials. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies are lower
compared to bisphanthrimidazole BPPI25 (HOMO:
−5.47 eV, LUMO: −2.29 eV), the smaller ELUMO of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN could reduce the electron
injection barrier and enhance the electron injection in the devices.26

The frontier molecular orbitals of DDIBNPPI
and DIBPPIN were simulated
by Gaussian 09 program. The HOMO of DDIBPPIN locates on diphenylimidazole
moiety, whereas the LUMO distributes on cyanonaphthyl zone, which
reveals the CT from diphenylimidazole to cyanonaphthyl fragment. The
HOMO of DDIBNPPI locates on phenanthrimidazole and partially on styryl
moiety, whereas the LUMO locates on phenyl and styryl and partially
on naphthyl phenanthrimidazole fragment (Figure 1). The small HOMO and LUMO overlap of DDIBPPIN
leads to small ΔEST, which enhanced the excition utilization
(ηs) through upconversion of triplet (nonradiative)
to singlet (radiative). The rigid geometry of DDIBPPIN limits the
flexibility, and minimized knr transition
results in higher ηPL efficiency.27 The interring torsion angles of highly twisted molecular
conformation suppress the intermolecular π–π stacking
in solid state, and thus aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching
was reduced. At this small interring torsion angle, the extended conjugation
is limited and also the amount of charge transfer is increased. This
is reflected in solvatochromic studies: high ηex could
be harvested from twisted conformation of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN by
limiting intermolecular interaction.28 The
excited-state properties of DDIBNPPI and DDIPPIN are discussed briefly
in SI–III: charge-transfer indexes (Figures S2–S7).

Single-Carrier Devices
The hole
and electron transport
abilities of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN were analyzed by hole-only device
(HOD)/electron-only device (EOD) with a structure of indium tin oxide
(ITO)/nucleolus precursor body (NPB) (8 nm)/DDIBNPPI or DDIBPPIN (50
nm) or CBP:Ir(ppy)3 or DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN:Ir(ppy)3(40 nm)/NPB (8 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (HOD) and ITO/TPBi (8 nm)/DDIBNPPI
or DDIBPPIN (40 nm)/TPBi (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) (EOD). The electron current
density of devices with DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN is higher than device
with CBP. This informed that DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN compounds are bipolar
transport materials more effectively transporting both electrons and
holes than CBP (Figure 4).29 The carrier current of CBP:5 wt %
Ir(ppy)3 device decreased because carrier may undergo trapping
at HOMO of Ir(ppy)3. However, the carrier current of DDIBPPIN
(40 nm):5 wt % Ir(ppy)3- or DDIBNPPI (40 nm):5 wt % Ir(ppy)3-based devices increased, which may be attributed to the direct
injection of carrier into dopant HOMO and hopping transport through
both DDIBNPPI/DDIBPPIN and dopant sites (Figure 4).

Electroluminescent Studies
Motivated
by high quantum
yield, excellent thermal stabilities, and excellent carrier transportation
of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN, nondoped blue devices were fabricated with
the structure of ITO/NPB (60 nm)/DDIBNPPI or DDIBPPIN (20 nm)/LiF
(1 nm)/Al (100 nm). The electroluminescence (EL) spectra of devices
(DDIBNPPI-437 and DDIBPPIN-429 nm) are similar to PL spectra (DDIBNPPI-436
and DDIBPPIN-429 nm), which informed that EL and PL originate from
same sources, i.e., radiative decay of singlet exciton (Table 2). High device performances
at low turn-on voltage are extracted from nondoped devices based on
DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN (Table 2). The DDIBPPIN-based blue device (429 nm) shows high efficiencies
(ηc = 4.91 cd/A, ηp = 4.56 lm/W,
ηex = 5.11%; Figure 5) at 2.9 V with CIE (0.15, 0.08) compared to DDIBNPPI
device (437 nm) (ηc = 4.78 cd/A, ηp = 4.32 lm/W, ηex = 4.73%) at 3.0 V with CIE (0.15,0.09).
The deeper emission of DDIBPPIN (429 nm) can be attributed to effective
molecular separation due to CN group, and the excellent efficiency
of DDIBPPIN compared to DDIBNPPI may due to higher quantum yield in
film.

To enhance electroluminescent
efficiencies, devices doped with
DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN and CBP as host were constructed: ITO/NPB(40
nm)/TCTA(5 nm)/CBP:DDIBNPPI or CBP:DDIBPPIN (20 nm)/TPBI (50 nm)/LiF
(1 nm)/Al(100 nm). The device with CBP:DDIBPPIN show higher luminous
efficiencies [L = 13 568 cd/m2;
ηex = 5.96%; ηc = 4.10 cd/A; ηp = 3.84 lm/W), CIE: (0.15,0.07)] compared to CBP:DDIBNPPI
device [L = 10 356 cd/m2; ηex = 4.92%; ηc = 3.58 cd/A; ηp = 3.46 lm/W), CIE: (0.15,0.07)] (Figure 5 and Table 2). The deeper CIEs with higher ηex are related to doping concentration, which not only suppresses exciton
concentration quenching but also minimizes the intermolecular CT effect
leading to bathochromic shift.29

At 100 cd/m2 brightness, insignificant efficiency rolloff
[ηex = 5.48% (DDIBNPPI) and 4.11% (DDIBPPIN)] was
observed. The balanced ambipolar charge transport ability of DDIBPPIN
equalized the injected holes and electrons, resulting in lower-efficiency
rolloff (8.05%) compared to DDIBNPPI (16.46%) (Figure 5).

These excellent luminous efficiencies
are as good as reported blue
OLEDs (CIEy ≈ 0.10; Table 3).15,16,30 The color purity (0.15, 0.07) and excellent
luminous efficiencies make DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN potential candidates
in OLEDs full-color display. Actually, the quantum yields of DDIBNPPI
and DDIBPPIN films are 86.0 and 89.0%, respectively. Thus, the upper
limit calculated from ηEQE = ηout × ηrc × ηγ ×
ΦPL31 [light-out-coupling
efficiency (ηout = 20%), product of charge recombination
efficiency (ηrc = 100%), efficiency of radiative
exciton production (ηγ = 25%), and ΦPL (photoluminescence quantum yield).

According
to film quantum yields of DDIBNPPI (86%) and DDIBPPIN
(89%), the theoretically calculated maximum ηEQE values
are 4.30 and 4.45%, whereas the experimental EQEs can reach 5.11 and
5.82%, respectively. The ηr values calculated for
DDIBNPPI (30–35%) and DDIBPPIN (38–40%) indicate that
γ is less than 100% due to small unbalanced carrier transportation.32 The maximum charge transportation was obtained
in the emissive layer by effective charge injection imparted by hole
transport layer. The ηIQE (ηEQE ÷
ηout) values of DDIBNPPI (25.6%) and DDIBPPIN (29.1%)
and ηs (ηs = ηres × ηPL × ηout ÷
ηEL) values of DDIBNPPI (30.0%) and DDIBPPIN (32.7%)
reveal that the maximum ηs of DDIBNPPI (30.0%) and
DDIBPPIN (32.7%) break the limit of 25% (Figure 6), 5.0% of triplet exciton transferred to
singlet exciton by RISC to enhance the emission, and rest undergo
nonradiative process for DDIBNPPI. For DDIBPPIN, 7.7% of triplet exciton
transferred to singlet exciton provides the possibility of higher-efficiency
blue OLEDs. Table 3 summarizes the luminous efficiencies of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN with
reported efficiencies,33−62 which reveal that DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN are the best nondoped emitters
in view of efficiency.

Figure 6 Energy-level diagram of singlet (S) and triplet (T) of
DDIBNPPI
and DDIBPPIN.

The additional triplet excitons
of DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN have been
used for enhancing the efficiency (Figure 6), which supports the precision of our molecular
design strategy. The DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN devices show maximum luminances
(L) of 16 268 and 18 031 cd/m2, respectively: EL brightness is related to current density, which
reveals that triplet–triplet annihilation contribution was
insignificant.63

The calculated triplet
energies (ET) of DDIBNPPI (2.30 eV) and
DDIBPPIN (2.40 eV) are sufficient to
sensitize phosphorescent dopant (ET <
2.3 eV). Hence, DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN are utilized as host materials
for red/green phosphorescent dopants. The vacuum-processed red device
configurations are: ITO/NPB (40 nm)/TCTA (5 nm)/DDIBNPPI (30 nm):
8 wt % Ir(MDQ)2(acac) or DDIBPPIN (30 nm): 8 wt % Ir(MDQ)2(acac)/TPBI (50 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Figure 7). All of the devices show
pure red and green emissions from the dopant, and there is not residual
emission from the host, implying that no excitons were wasted for
host emission and that the effective exothermic energy transfer occurred
from the host to the dopant.64 The EL spectra
are similar to PL spectra (Figures 8 and 2), and the red device
(624 nm) with DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) shows maximum L of 69 889 cd/m2 and excellent EL efficiencies
[ηex = 19.6%; ηc = 34.6 cd/A; ηp = 35.8 lm/W with CIE (0.60, 0.39)] compared to DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) device [L = 67 456 cd/m2; ηex = 18.3%; ηc = 30.4
cd/A; ηp = 34.1 lm/W; CIE (0.60,0.39)] with EL =
625 nm. The green device (DDIBPPIN:Ir(ppy)3/DDIPNPPI:Ir(ppy)3) exhibits maximum L of 69 906/69 482 cd/m2, ηex = 17.9/17.0%, ηc =
59.8/58.6 cd/A, and ηp = 63.6/61.3 lm/W with CIE
(0.30,0.60)/(0.30,0.60) (Figure 8).

of green devices with DDIBNPPI:Ir(ppy)3, DDIBPPIN:Ir(ppy)3, and red devices based on DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac),
DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac), and white devices with DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac)(0.4%) and DDIBPPIN: Ir(MDQ)2(acac)(0.4%).

A comparison of green and red device efficiencies
with already
reported efficiencies65−72 reveals that the synthesized materials DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN are
universal host materials for green/red phosphorescent emitters. In
these devices, DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN act as hosts for Ir(MDQ)2(acac) in addition to blue emitters. When the doping concentration
is 0.4%, both devices DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) [438 nm (sh),
610 nm] and DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) [429 nm (sh), 610 nm]
show white emission with two peaks (Figure 8): one part of exciton transferred to ET of Ir(MDQ)2(acac) to excite phosphorescence,
whereas the other part of exciton transferred to ground state to cause
fluorescence. The generated excitons were totally transferred to Ir(MDQ)2(acac) to give phosphorescent emission by increasing the doping
concentration. The white device based on DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) exhibits maximum ηex of 16.6%, ηc of 35.6 cd/A, and ηp of 36.6 lm/W with CIE
(0.47, 0.32) compared to DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2 (acac)-based
device [ηex = 15.8%; ηc = 31.4 cd/A;
ηp = 36.1 lm/W with CIE (0.49,0.36)]. The small charge
injection barrier is beneficial to reduce operating voltages. The
blue emission of EL spectrum of DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac)
device was broader than DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) at 0.4%
doping concentration: more blue fluorescence contribution in device
DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) than DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) device, which results in lower device efficiencies of DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) than DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) device. The
marvelous efficiencies harvested from DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN imply
that they are potential host materials in OLEDs. The high efficiencies
are due to the efficient exciton transfer (Figure 7): part of singlet exciton formed on host
may be transferred to singlet energy of blue fluorescent emitter (BS1) to exhibit blue emission, whereas another part of singlet
exciton may be transferred to singlet state of green/red phosphorescent
emitters (GS1/RS1) and then transferred to triplet
state of green and red phosphorescent emitters (GT1/RT1) by ISC process to enhance red and green phosphorescent emissions.
Furthermore, triplet exciton formed on host could be transferred from
HT1 to RT1 and GT1 consecutively
to enhance the exciton utilization (Figure 7).

Conclusions
We
have developed thermally stable bis-phenanthroimidazole derivatives
(DDIBNPPI and DDIBPPIN), a new blue emitter with bipolar properties.
The fabricated DDIBPPIN blue device (429 nm) shows high efficiencies
(ηc = 4.91 cd/A; ηp = 4.56 lm/W;
ηex = 5.11%) at 2.9 V with CIE (0.15, 0.08). The
doped device based on CBP:DDIBPPIN shows maximum efficiencies [L = 13 568 cd/m2; ηex = 5.96%; ηc = 4.10 cd/A; ηp =
3.84 lm/W, CIE: (0.15, 0.07)] compared to CBP:DDIBNPPI-based device
[L = 10 356 cd/m2; ηex = 4.92%; ηc = 3.58 cd/A; ηp = 3.46 lm/W, CIE: (0.15, 0.07)]. The maximum ηIQE’s of DDIBNPPI (25.6%) and DDIBPPIN (29.1%) and maximum ηs’s of DDIBNPPI (30.0%) and DDIBPPIN (32.7%) have been
harvested from EL devices. The green device with DDIBPPIN:Ir(ppy)3/DDIPNPPI:Ir(ppy)3 exhibits maximum L of 69 906/69 486
cd/m2; ηex of 17.9/17.0%; ηc of 59.8/58.6 cd/A; and ηp = 63.6/61.3 lm/W
with CIE (0.30,0.60)/(0.30,0.60). The red device (624 nm) with DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) exhibits maximum luminance of 69 889 cd/m2 and excellent EL efficiencies [ηex = 19.6%;
ηc = 34.6 cd/A; ηp = 35.8 lm/W with
CIE (0.60,0.39)] compared to DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac)-based
device [L = 67 456 cd/m2; ηex = 18.3%; ηc = 30.4 cd/A; ηp = 34.1 lm/W; CIE (0.60, 0.39)] with EL 625 nm. The white device
based on DDIBPPIN:Ir(MDQ)2(acac) exhibits maximum ηex of 16.6%; ηc of 35.6 cd/A; ηp of 36.6 lm/W, with CIE (0.47, 0.32) compared to DDIBNPPI:Ir(MDQ)2(acac)-based device [ηex = 15.8%; ηc = 31.4 cd/A; ηp = 36.1 lm/W, with CIE (0.49,
0.36)]. We have focused structure modification strategy to harvest
efficient full-color OLEDs by utilizing the multifunctional bis-phenanthrimidazoles
in doped and nondoped red, green, and white PHOLEDs.

Measurements
All
solvents and reagents were used as
purchased from Aldrich without further purification. NMR and mass
spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer using
CDCl3 as the solvent with TMS as internal standard, and
MALDI-TOF MS mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent (LCMS VL SD)
instrument. UV–vis absorptions in solution and film were measured
using PerkinElmer Lambda 35 and Lambda 35 spectrophotometers with
integrated sphere (RSA-PE-20), respectively. Photoluminescence measurements
(10–5 mol/L) were recorded with a PerkinElmer LS55
fluorescence spectrometer. The absolute quantum yields of solution
and doped film were determined with fluorescence spectrometer Model-F7100
with integrating sphere. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed on a Perkin Elmer thermal
analysis system and NETZSCH-DSC-204, respectively, with a heating
rate of 10 °C/min and a N2 flow rate of 100 mL/min.
Fluorescence lifetimes were estimated with time-resolved fluorescence
decay obtained by time-correlated single-photon counting method on
a Horiba Fluorocube-01-NL lifetime system. Electrochemical measurements
were performed with potentiostat CHI 630A electrochemical analyzer:
Ag/Ag+ as a pseudoreference electrode, platinum wire used
as an auxiliary electrode, and standardized against ferrocene/ferrocenium
with HOMO of −4.80 eV. The oxidation potentials were measured
in CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumperchlorate
as a supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. The frontier
molecular orbital energies (EHOMO and ELUMO) were determined using (Eox + 4.8 eV)] and EHOMO–λonset, respectively.

Computational Details
The S0 (ground)

transition density matrix, and hole–particle distribution map)
with Gaussian 09 program73 and multifunctional
wave function analyzer (Multiwfn).74

Fabrication Measurement
Fabrication of electroluminescence
devices was performed by vacuum deposition of materials on ITO (resistance,
20 Ω/sq) at 10–6 Torr. All organic layers
were deposited at a rate of 1–2 Å/s; LiF/Al were deposited
with 0.1 and 10 Å/s rates, respectively. Thicknesses of deposited
layers were monitored by quartz crystal thickness monitor. The EL
spectra with CIE coordinates of these fabricated were measured with
a USB-650-VIS-NIR spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Inc.). The luminance–current
and density–voltage characteristics were recorded simultaneously
by measurement of EL spectra combining spectrometer with Keithley2400
programmable voltage–current source and light intensity meter
LS-110 under ambient atmosphere. The external quantum efficiency was
calculated from current density, EL spectrum, and luminance assuming
Lambertian distribution.
