We
have upgraded our Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities
(CANDO) platform for shotgun drug repurposing by including ligand-based,
data fusion, and decision tree pipelines. The goal of shotgun drug
repurposing is to screen and rank every existing human use drug or
compound for every disease/indication. The first version of CANDO
implemented a structure-based pipeline that modeled interactions between
compounds and proteins on a large scale, generating compound–proteome
interaction signatures used to infer the similarity of drug behavior;
the new pipelines accomplish this by incorporating molecular fingerprints
and the Tanimoto coefficient. We obtain improved benchmarking performance
with the new pipelines across all three evaluation metrics used: average
indication accuracy, pairwise accuracy, and coverage. The best performing
pipeline achieves an average indication accuracy of 19.0% at the top10
cutoff, compared to 11.7% for v1, and 2.2% for a random control. Our
results demonstrate that the CANDO drug recovery accuracy is substantially
improved by integrating multiple pipelines, thereby enhancing our
ability to generate putative therapeutic repurposing candidates, and
increasing drug discovery efficiency.

Introduction
Drug Repurposing
Bringing a new drug to the market
may costs hundreds of millions of dollars and takes years of work.1 Drug repurposing is the process of discovering
a new use for an existing drug.2,3 This process may take
advantage of existing data on safety and pharmacokinetic properties
from previous trials and clinical use to reduce costs and time associated
with traditional drug discovery. Classic examples of drug repurposing
include sildenafil and thalidomide,2,4 which initially
were developed to treat chest pain and morning sickness but repurposed
to treat erectile dysfunction and erythema nodosum leprosum or multiple
myeloma, respectively.5 Drugs that have
already been repurposed once are being researched for even more novel
uses. For example, raloxifene was originally indicated for prevention
of osteoporosis and subsequently approved for risk reduction in the
development of breast cancer.6 More recently,
raloxifene has been suggested as a possible treatment for Ebola virus
disease.7−9 These examples of putative and/or successful drug
repurposing underlies the diverse mechanisms through which a single
compound may treat a variety of disease types.10,11 High-throughput, target-based, and phenotypic screening of compounds
can be used to generate putative candidates for repurposing.12 For example, potential treatments for Zika virus
infection were identified using a phenotypic screen.13

Computational Drug Discovery and Repurposing
Finding
new drugs or new uses for existing drugs computationally takes advantage
of the growing amount of data generated from wet lab experiments accessible
on the Internet, increased computational power, and higher fidelity
of computational models to reality. Approaches to computational drug
discovery and repurposing have been classified as structure- or ligand-based.14−16 In structure-based methods, the structure of a target macromolecule,
usually a protein, is used to identify small compounds that modulate
its behavior. The structure may have been determined via X-ray diffraction
or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or modeled using template-free
(de novo) or template-based (homology or comparative) modeling.17−19 Molecular docking and/or rational drug design is then used to identify
ligands that specifically fit into a protein binding or active site.20,21 In ligand-based methods, the focus is on the compound, and similarity
between representations is used to assess whether a compound modulates
the activity of a target or treat a disease like a known drug. Examples
of ligand-based drug design include 2D and 3D similarity searching,22 pharmacophore modeling,23 and quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR).14 A virtual screening experiment is typically
a large-scale analysis of molecular shape or molecular docking data
to suggest possible further development of hits into leads.24

Data fusion is a technique in the field
of cheminformatics for combining intermolecular similarity data from
different sources or methods.25−27 Compounds are ranked relative
to each other based on the similarity scores. Multiple rankings of
compounds produced by different methods of detecting similarity may
be combined into a single ranking.25 Ideally,
disparate sources or types of data may yield orthogonality or complementarity
in results, that is, different top compounds are captured and reported
as putative therapeutics for different reasons.28,29 For example, Tan et al. obtained an increased recall rate in a virtual
screening experiment using ligand-based two dimensional fingerprint
data fused with structure-based molecular docking energies.30 Ligand- and structure-based methods have been
combined for use in virtual screening pipelines and platforms, with
successes reported in the use of sequential, parallel, and hybrid
techniques for data integration.29 Data
fusion has been also been used to devise weighting schemes for correct
dosing.31

Newer computational techniques
for drug discovery and repurposing
gaining in prominence go beyond the structure- and ligand-based categorization.
The Connectivity Map is a “reference collection of gene-expression
profiles from cultured human cells treated with bioactive small molecules”,32 that is, a tool to identify changes in gene
expression due to a compound or a disease. If a compound causes changes
in gene expression level opposite to a disease (for instance, a disease
causes upregulation of the expression of a set of genes, and the compound
causes downregulation of the same set of genes), then that compound
is considered to be therapeutically useful in the treatment of that
disease.32 Peyvandipour et al. combined
an updated version of the Connectivity Map with knowledge of drug-disease
gene networks, measuring the perturbation effect of drugs on whole
systems.33 Using this model, they predicted
novel treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell
lung cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer while simultaneously
improving the recall rate of known drug-disease associations.33 Machine learning-based approaches have also
been used to cluster drugs or diseases and predicting new drug activity
and usage.34−38 Methods for finding novel uses of drugs based on analysis of biomedical
literature,39,40 electronic health records,38,41 and biological networks42,43 have also been reported.

Drug Similarity
Implementations of drug discovery and
drug repurposing sometimes rely on the principle of similar molecules
having similar properties.44,45 In drug design, repurposing,
or screening, similar compounds are generally assumed to have similar
molecular targets. In structure-based drug discovery, if two potential
molecular targets are identified as similar, then a compound that
modulates one target is inferred to modulate the other. In ligand-based
methods, similar compounds are inferred to analogously modulate the
behavior of the same target(s). In our computational shotgun drug
repurposing experiments, we extend the similarity property principle
to examining interactions on a proteomic scale. Compounds with similar
proteomic interaction signatures are hypothesized to be effective
for the same indication(s).

Shotgun Drug Repurposing with CANDO
The goal of the
Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform
for shotgun drug discovery and repurposing is to screen every human
use compound/drug against every indication/disease.46−49 The tenets of CANDO include docking
with dynamics and multitargeting, which have been developed over the
past decade and a half.50−52 The first version of CANDO (v1)
applied a bioinformatic docking protocol on large libraries of compound
and protein structures. The multitargeting nature of drugs53 is captured by inferring their similarity on
a proteomic scale after calculating interactions between all compounds
and all proteins in the corresponding libraries.8,46,47 This is key, as indications can be multifactorial
in nature, involving disparate or intertwined pathways.16,54−57 Similar compounds, as determined by the root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of their proteomic interaction signatures, are hypothesized
to behave similarly, that is, compounds that are ranked highly (most
similar compound–proteome interaction signatures) to a drug
with an approved indication are hypothesized to be repurposable drugs/compounds
for that indication.

There exist other approaches to determine
compound similarity without the need for docking calculations on a
proteomic level. Different mathematical representations of molecules
capture different chemical, physical, or functional aspects of a compound.
Two or three dimensional molecular fingerprints are used in the field
of cheminformatics to describe compounds.58 In these models, the physical arrangement of atoms in a compound
is captured as a binary vector where each entry of a vector indicates
the presence or absence of a specific molecular feature.45 A distance (similarity) metric between these
vectors can be measured using metrics such as the Tanimoto coefficient,
a widely used metric in medicinal chemistry and ligand-based virtual
screening.45,59−61 The compound–proteome
interaction signatures constructed using the structure-based docking
methods in CANDO are analogous to molecular fingerprints as mathematical
representations of a compound. Both uniquely capture properties of
a compound in a computationally tractable manner, albeit in a different
descriptor space. CANDO is novel in the use of these protein structure-based
data vectors as a type of mathematical representation for shotgun
drug repurposing, and this work is an important step in comparison
of different mathematical representations of drug likeness or behavior
for this purpose.

Benchmarking across all pipelines is accomplished
by examining
the ranks of other approved drugs for the same indication against
a gold standard set of indications with two approved drugs to identify
how well they perform not only relative to each other but also to
analyze where the differences lie and what areas need improvement.46,47 Finally, CANDO can be used to make predictions for any indication
with at least one approved drug.

In this study, we extend CANDO
to include ligand-based drug repurposing
by creating new pipelines based on identifying compound similarity
based on their molecular fingerprints as well as data fusion pipelines
that combine the protein-centric and protein-agnostic approaches.
The new ligand-based pipelines in CANDO are based on molecular fingerprint
similarity calculations using the Research Development Kit (RDKit)62 and not meant as an exhaustive exploration of
all possible CANDO pipelines that can be built using all the fingerprint
descriptions available from RDKit. Instead, we constructed pipelines
using well-studied molecular fingerprints63 to evaluate the feasibility and compare and contrast benchmarking
performance. Using the standard CANDO benchmarking procedure (see Methods), several of the pipelines described here
yielded better performance than those previously obtained using only
v1.

Based on an exhaustive search of the literature, this is
the first
instance of molecular fingerprints being applied to the shotgun drug
repurposing problem. While 2D fingerprint-based methods have been
shown to generally outperform 3D structure-based approaches for virtual
screening,45 our work takes it one step
beyond in applying it to shotgun drug repurposing and benchmarking
it to every indication. Indeed, while many methods exist for virtual
screening typically based on one or a few targets, and some may be
better at that task than others, the results are not always colinear
in the context of drug repurposing. Previously, it was unclear which
fingerprint descriptors would perform the best for drug repurposing.
More importantly, we provide frameworks for other virtual screening
techniques to be applied to drug repurposing and combining them while
retaining the individual benefits of each technique. This application
of a ligand- and ligand/structure-based combination analysis is in
alignment with the traditional division of virtual screening into
ligand- and structure-based methods. However, this specific application
to drug repurposing combined with benchmarking to a large gold standard
data set has never been performed.

Combination of other pipelines
using data fusion as well as a decision
tree approach between v1 and the best performing ligand-based approach
(“ECFP4”) yielded better benchmarking performance than
using only either pipeline, allowing for increased accuracy while
retaining the mechanistic and precision medicine opportunities afforded
by the protein-centric approach of v1. Higher benchmarking accuracies
are indicative of higher drug repurposing potential, increased confidence
in our predictions, a decreased number of compounds that must be tested
in wet lab experiments and clinical trials to obtain true hits, and
thus less time and cost required to find a new use for an old drug.

Results
Benchmarking Performance of the Different Pipelines
The new pipelines (Figure 4) generally outperform v1 for all three metrics used to evaluate
benchmarking performance: average indication accuracy, pairwise accuracy,
and coverage (Figure 1). The MUL:v1,ECFP4 data fusion pipeline, created by multiplying
the compound–compound similarity scores (RMSD of interaction
signatures) from v1 with the Tanimoto coefficient measured between
the compounds described using the ECFP4 molecular fingerprint, yields
the overall best performance relative to v1 and the ones based on
fingerprint comparisons. Specifically, we obtained the highest top10,
top25, and top50 average indication accuracies of 17.3, 23.8, and
29.6% using this data fusion pipeline. The highest top1% (or top37)
and top100 average indication accuracies of 26.8 and 36.7% were obtained
using the pipeline based on the ECFP4 molecular fingerprints. Most
of the molecular fingerprint pipelines outperform the original v1
pipeline with the exception of ECFP0, a fingerprint based on simple
atom count quantization (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Benchmarking performance of different CANDO platform pipelines.
The average indication accuracy (top), pairwise accuracy (middle),
and coverage (bottom) for each pipeline are shown at different cutoffs.
The value for the top10 cutoff is denoted by dark purple, top25 by
light purple, top1% (or top37) by yellow, top50 by green, and top100
by light blue. The individual pipeline with the best performance at
each each cutoff is denoted by a red dot. The meta decision tree pipeline
was built by combining two pipelines, v1 and ECFP4, using the highest
average indication accuracy from either pipeline. Therefore, it has
the highest average indication accuracy, pairwise accuracy, and coverage
but is excluded by the “Best at cutoff” marker and plotted
on a separate axis. The pipelines in all plots are sorted according
to increasing top10 average indication accuracy, the most stringent
criteria used in our benchmarking. The MUL:v1,ECFP4 pipeline yields
the overall best performance relative to the other individual structure-
and ligand-based pipelines. The pipeline based on the ECFP4 molecular
fingerprint produces the highest top1% and top100 average indication
accuracies (top). When assessing pairwise accuracy (middle), ECFP4
is the best performing individual pipeline at all cutoffs. The coverage
(bottom) plot is the percentage of the 1439 indications for which
a pipeline produces a nonzero indication accuracy. The data fusion
pipelines of MUL:v1,ECFP4 and MIN:v1,RDK6 have the highest coverage
at the top50 and top25 cutoffs, the ECFP4 at the top10 and top50 cutoffs,
and RDK6 at the top100 cutoff. Overall, the pipelines using molecular
fingerprints have promise and potential for shotgun drug repurposing
by themselves, but the data fusion and decision tree pipelines that
combine structure- and ligand-based approaches achieve the best performance
while retaining the benefits of both types of approaches.

The decision tree meta pipeline, built by combining other
pipelines
based on the higher average indication accuracies, yields accuracies
of 19.0, 25.7, 28.9, 31.5, and 39.1% at the five cutoffs used. In
contrast, the best performing control generated from uniformly random
compound–compound similarity data obtains average indication
accuracies of 2.2% at the top10 cutoff, the most stringent one used
to benchmark the CANDO platform (Figure 1).

In terms of pairwise accuracy (%),
which is the weighted average
of the per indication accuracies based on the number of compounds
approved for a given indication (see Methods), ECFP4 outperforms all other individual pipelines with accuracies
of 28.5, 38.9, 43.8, 47.9, and 58.8% at the five cutoffs. The meta
decision tree pairwise accuracies are 30.0, 40.5, 45.2, 49.1, and
60.0%.

The coverage metric evaluates the fraction (or percentage)
of the
1439 indications with two approved drugs for which there is at least
one instance of a successful recapture or recovery of the known drug
within a particular cutoff. The ECFP4 pipeline has the highest top10
and top1% coverage of 45.9 and 54.2%, the MIN:v1,RDK6 yields the highest
top25 coverage of 52.3%, the MUL:v1,ECFP4 has the highest coverage
at the top50 cutoff of 56.9%, and RDK6 the highest at the top100 cutoff
of 62.8%. In contrast, the decision tree pipeline obtains coverage
values of 45.9, 50.6, 54.2, 56.6, and 62.1%. For almost half of all
the 1439 indications, we capture a drug associated with that indication
within the top25 cutoff (Figure 1).

Distribution of Indication Accuracies between
the Two Types
of Pipelines
To compare and contrast the behavior of the
structure- and ligand-based pipelines, we calculated histograms of
the average indication accuracies and counts of the highest per indication
accuracies at each cutoff for two pipelines (v1 and ECFP4), excluding
indications for which a 0% average indication accuracy is obtained. Figure 2 shows that the ECFP4
pipeline has more indications with higher accuracies than v1 (the
yellow histogram is shifted to the right of the purple histogram).
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistical test p-values
shown in the corresponding left-hand side graph of Figure 2 indicate that the distributions
of the v1 and ECFP4 accuracies are drawn from different samples in
a statistically significant manner. The Venn diagrams of the 1439
indications in CANDO with more than one approved drug shows that v1
obtains a higher top10 accuracy for 150 indications, while ECFP4 obtains
a higher top10 accuracy for 445, and 122 indications have the same
nonzero top10 accuracy for both pipelines. As the cutoff increases,
more indications have higher accuracies using the ECFP4 pipeline relative
to v1, while the number of indications with the same accuracy increases
relatively. The orthogonality in the histograms and Venn diagrams
indicate that both types of pipelines appear necessary for maximum
coverage and accuracy across all the indications. Figure 2 also suggests that additional
pipelines and/or improvement in existing pipelines is necessary to
recover drugs for ≈500 indications that are not covered by
either pipeline at the highest cutoff.

Figure 2 Comparison and overlap
of indication accuracy distributions for
two CANDO platform pipelines at different cutoffs. The left-hand side
shows the histograms of the counts of indications with a particular
average indication accuracy (or accuracy distributions) for two pipelines,
v1 (purple) and ECFP4 (yellow). Indications where both pipelines perform
equally well are indicated by brown. For example, at the top10 cutoff,
there are approximately 200 indications that achieve an average accuracy
between 10 and 20% using the v1 pipeline but just over 100 using ECFP4.
At all cutoffs, a greater number of indications with higher accuracies
is observed for the ECFP4 pipeline (increase in yellow along the horizontal
axis). The p-value, derived from the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test statistic applied to the two distributions at each cutoff, indicates
that they are significantly different. On the right-hand side of the
figure are Venn diagrams of the set of indications with higher accuracies
at each cutoff (excluding indications with 0% accuracy). For example,
at the top10 cutoff, there are 150 indications for which the v1 pipeline
yields higher average indication accuracies, 445 for which the ECFP4
pipeline is higher, and 122 with the same performance. The ECFP4 pipeline
performs better than v1 for more indications at all cutoffs, but both
pipelines appear to be necessary to achieve the best performance across
all indications for shotgun drug repurposing.

Putative Drug Candidate Generation and Validation
The
top ranking putative drug candidates generated by the v1 pipeline
for eight indications, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis
C, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer’s
disease, are available from Figure 3 and Supplementary Material of a previous publication.46 The top candidates were chosen based on a concurrence
score, which is “the number of occurrences of particular compounds
in each set of top 25 predictions generated for all of the drugs approved
for a particular indication”.46 Using
this concurrence score, we generated the top candidate drugs to treat
the same indications with the ECFP4 molecular fingerprint and the
MUL:v1,ECFP4 data fusion pipelines. We then searched the biomedical
literature using PubMed and Google Scholar for published studies corroborating
these top candidates.

Figure 3 Examples of therapeutic predictions made by CANDO bound
or docked
to one of their respective corroborating targets. (a) Compound acarbose
(red) bound to Mycobacterium smegmatis trehalose synthease. (PDB ID: 3ZOA). (b) Compound tiapride (red) docked
to the human D2 receptor.

Both of the new pipelines predict acarbose as a treatment for tuberculosis.
Traditionally, acarbose is an inhibitor of the α-glucosidase
enzyme and used in the worldwide treatment of type 2 diabetes.64 Lending credence to our prediction, in studying
the glycobiology of Mycobacterium smegmatis (a model infectious agent for the Mycobacterium genus and thus tuberculosis), high-resolution structures of the
enzyme trehalose synthase have been solved in complex with acarbose.65 The enzyme is a key member of a carbohydrate
pathway; therefore, its inhibition may be of potential therapeutic
importance. Caner et al. solved the structure of trehalose synthase
with bound acarbose,65 as shown in Figure 3a (PDB ID: 3ZOA). From a non-infectious
disease perspective, both of the new pipelines rank tiapride among
the top25 via the concurrence score as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.
Tiapride is a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist,66 shown docked to the D2 receptor in Figure 3b. Dopaminergic blockade
has been shown to increase insulin secretion from islet cells in cell
models;67 there are case reports of tiapride
therapy causing hypoglycemia in the elderly,68 and there is a generalized increase risk for hypoglycemia in the
elderly taking an antipsychotic medication.69 These all point toward tiapride potentially being used as an antihyperglycemic
treatment of type 2 diabetes, though benefits would have to be carefully
weighed against negative side effects.

All three pipelines recommend
known antivirals for hepatitis B.
For hepatitis C, all three pipelines list didanosine in the top ranked
candidates. Unfortunately, the concurrent use of didanosine and traditional
hepatitis treatments may induce dangerous consequences for the patient,70 illustrating the need for careful expert curation
of top candidates generated by the CANDO platform. For Alzheimer’s
disease, one of the highest scoring compounds from the MUL:v1,ECFP4
pipeline was dextromethorphan. In 2015, a study was published showing
dextromethorphan hydrobromide/quinidine sulfate was well tolerated
in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and had clinically relevant
efficacy in treating patients, as measured via agitation.71 These examples indicate that new putative drug
candidate generation by the CANDO platform with these integrated pipelines
is likely to work as well, if not better, relative to the prospective
validation studies previously done using v1 or its components.8,51,72−75 The full list of drug candidates
for the above indications based on the concurrence score using the
newer pipelines are given in the Supporting Information and available
at http://protinfo.org/cando/results/fingerprinting_cando. Putative
drug candidate predictions for all 2030 indications in the platform
using the v1 pipeline are available at http://protinfo.org/cando/data/raw/matrix/.

Discussion
Interpretation of Results
We have
added new pipelines
based on ligand-based fingerprint comparisons to the CANDO platform
(Figure 4) that increase benchmarking performance relative to
the original v1 protein-centric pipeline (Figure 1). In addition, we also identified where
the differences lie and what areas/indications need further improvement
for each pipeline. Finally, our individual and combined pipelines
are capable of making predictions for every indication with at least
one approved drug, and in some cases, we have found corroborating
evidence supporting these predictions.

Figure 4 Flow diagram of the CANDO
platform pipelines used for shotgun drug
repurposing. The v1 structure-based pipeline is the original protein-centric
approach based on a bioinformatic docking protocol used to construct
compound–proteome interaction signatures. The ligand-based
pipelines are based on molecular fingerprint representations of compounds.
The data fusion pipelines consist of a combination these two types
of pipelines after calculating compound–compound similarity,
and the decision tree pipeline is devised based on the performance
of individual structure- and ligand-based pipelines (see Methods). All pipelines, except the decision tree
pipeline, generate a compound–compound similarity matrix that
is sorted and ranked. These rankings are used to generate putative
repurposable drug candidates and evaluate benchmarking performance.
The figure illustrates the utility of implementing, as well as comparing
and contrasting, multiple (types of) pipelines in the CANDO platform
for shotgun drug repurposing.

Higher benchmarking accuracies are expected to result in better
drug repurposing predictions. The top ranked similar compounds to
the known drugs for a particular indication using the pipeline with
the best benchmarking performance is expected to produce hits and
leads with the highest likelihood of success when validated in downstream
preclinical and clinical studies. The decreased need to test a large
number of compounds with the new pipelines, along with greater confidence
in the computational models of drug-indication associations, realizes
the goal of drug repurposing: making drug discovery more efficient
by reducing the labor, time, and risk in finding new uses for existing
therapeutics.

Using the new pipelines based on molecular fingerprinting
and data
fusion with v1 (Figure 4), we obtain better benchmarking performance than using v1 by itself
(Figure 1). Our cutoffs
for calculating performance metrics are chosen based on collaborations
with wet lab experimentalists willing to test the top candidates generated
by our CANDO platform for particular indications. In practice, when
working with preclinical and clinical collaborators, we currently
employ the decision tree approach of selecting the pipeline with the
highest accuracy for a specific indication and the desired cutoff.
For example, if a collaborator is capable of validating 10 candidates
for Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma (MeSH identifier
D015452), which is one of the 150 candidates where benchmarking performance
is better using the v1 pipeline relative to ECFP4, then we would use
the former pipeline to generate the top 10 putative drug candidates
for this indication.

The new integrated pipelines also yield
a higher number of indications
covered relative to v1, that is, more indications with a nonzero accuracy,
demonstrating their generalized utility for shotgun drug repurposing.
Indication-specific validation studies may rely on the pipeline with
the highest accuracy for that indication, but CANDO platform development
in shotgun drug repurposing requires that the coverage also increase
in addition to the average indication and pairwise accuracy. The best
performing random control achieves a top10 average indication accuracy
of 2.2%, and the random control based on random sampling from the
distribution the v1 compound–protein interaction matrix values
yielded a top10 accuracy of 0.2%.46,47 These random
control accuracies are at least an order of magnitude lower than the
accuracies obtained using the newer pipelines and align with expected
hit rates in high-throughput screening.76 All pipelines yield better performance when compared to the random
control (Figure 1),
and the differences between the performances of the different pipelines
and that of the control signify the value added by our chosen approaches.
The orthogonality in the histograms and Venn diagrams of Figure 2 indicate that both
types of pipelines appear necessary for maximum coverage and accuracy
across all the indications.

Limitations and Future Work
Furthermore,
our results
also show that ligand-based methods for drug repurposing are far from
perfect and still need improvement since the average/overall metrics
in Figure 1 do not
show per indication differences (but which can be gleaned from Figure 2). Both types of
approaches, ligand- and structure-based, fail to cover approximately
half the 1439 indications in our data set (i.e., produce a benchmarking
accuracy of 0% even at the top100 cutoff), and ligand-based methods
do worse than structure-based methods for over 100 indications. This
highlights areas of improvement and development for both types of
methods, which can only be obtained from a work of this nature. The
utility of combining these approaches, while producing a marginal
improvement in accuracy, is also important, since target and off-target
information is obtainable only from the structure-based methods. Our
combined approach results in a “best of both worlds”
scenario, although we do not consider the decision tree pipeline while
identifying the best performing one in Figure 1, since it is not an individual pipeline,
it yields the highest performance values.

We are further enhancing
CANDO by improving the performance of existing pipelines via parameter
optimization,77 exploration of different
docking approaches to generate the compound–proteome interaction
signatures, adding new orthogonal pipelines based on compound–pathway
signatures,78 implementing more sophisticated
data fusion and machine learning approaches, and by continued dissection
of the features responsible for pipeline performance and behavior.47,48,78

Notwithstanding the relative
benchmarking performance of the existing
CANDO platform pipelines, the structure-based virtual screening or
protein docking pipelines are not without their merits. The protein-centric
approach enables mechanistic understanding of drug action by modeling
compound–protein interactions at the atomic level. Additionally,
the protein-centric approach readily lends itself to problems in precision
medicine/drug repurposing: Incorporating genetic changes, and modeling
amino acid mutations due to nonsynonymous nucleotide polymorphisms
in protein structures, will result in altered compound–protein
interaction scores, allowing us to tailor drug repurposing candidates
to an individual genome/proteome. The protein-centric approach facilitates
consideration of polypharmacy, where the cumulative effects of multiple
drugs on protein targets can be evaluated by the analysis and integration
of the corresponding drug-proteome interaction signatures, which can
then be used to generate putative drug cocktails and combination therapy
candidates. The protein-centric pipeline may also be used to generate
putative drug candidates for indications without any approved drugs,
but where the target protein or proteome is known.8

We are continuing to enhance the virtual screening
pipelines to
model reality more accurately, with the goal of increasing compound–proteome
signature comparison accuracy. For instance, we are exploring the
use of different molecular docking programs, such as CANDOCK79,80 and AutoDock Vina,81 to populate the
compound–proteome interaction signatures. An updated version
of the v1 pipeline, v1.5, with parameters optimized for scoring compound–proteome
interactions, yields benchmarking performance that is 10% higher relatively
at the top10 cutoff (12.8% for v1.5 vs 11.7% for v1).77 By combining the improved protein-centric and protein-agnostic
pipelines using data fusion, we obtain the best performance and retain
the benefits of both types of approaches while minimizing the weaknesses
of any single approach.

The higher benchmarking performance
obtained by the ligand-based
pipelines may in part be due to the nature of drug discovery and development,
which is biased in favor of already effective compounds in an effort
to break into a new market or retain market dominance by generating
new intellectual property. New drugs are often derivatives of existing
ones with small changes.82,83 Repurposing based on
molecular fingerprint similarity will be highly enriched for these
“me too” compounds,83 given
that the approach to shotgun drug repurposing in the CANDO platform
is currently based on detecting drug-compound similarities.

Our benchmarking performance metrics are biased toward reporting
particular pipelines as better when they capture what is already known/approved
and not novel repurposing candidates that will work to treat or cure
an indication in reality. Barring large-scale preclinical validation
of putative drug candidates, it remains a reproducible and a meaningful
measure in our studies.46−48

Our goal in this study
was to assess the value of adding fingerprinting
and data fusion pipelines to the existing protein-centric pipelines
in the CANDO platform and not an exhaustive enumeration, comparison,
and fusion of ligand- and structure-based approaches for identifying
drug associations.84 More sophisticated
fingerprint representations encode the structures of compounds differently
and capture unique features particularly of relevance to drug discovery
and repurposing. Future work will extend our analyses to include additional
fingerprints that can be created using RDKit, including the Long Extended
and Feature Connectivity Fingerprints (LECFP and LFCFP, respectively).
Longer fingerprints have been shown to better describe a compound
with less redundancy, leading to increased accuracy in virtual screening.85

Features and categories of indications,
proteins, and compounds
all influence the drug repurposing accuracy of CANDO. We are continuing
to undertake thorough experiments exploring the roles of particular
features responsible for benchmarking performance.47,48,78 Incorporating machine learning to understand
how compound–proteome interaction signatures influence performance
will help us find the most parsimonious molecular descriptors for
compounds. Drugs may have targets beyond proteins, including DNA and
RNA.86,87 To better model how a compound interacts
with all potential targets, we are integrating compound–nucleic
acid interaction modeling into CANDO. Finally, we are working with
collaborators to validate the predictions from the various pipelines
in preclinical and clinical studies, which represents the ultimate
test of the CANDO platform.

Conclusions
CANDO
is a computational platform for shotgun drug discovery and
repurposing. We implemented new ligand-based and data fusion pipelines
in the CANDO platform and obtained substantial improvement in benchmarking
performance using a combination of protein-centric and protein-agnostic
methods. These improved results indicate greater confidence in drug
repurposing predictions made by us using CANDO and demonstrate the
value of considering different, orthogonal, types of approaches for
calculating compound–compound similarities. Our integrated
approach moves us closer to developing an accurate, robust, and reliable
computational drug repurposing platform and using it to understand
how small molecules interact with each other and with larger macromolecules
in their corresponding environments.

Methods
Figure 4 illustrates
the different pipelines evaluated in this study, which are described
in detail below.

The CANDO Platform and the Version 1 (v1)
Pipeline
A detailed description of the CANDO platform, including
the v1 pipeline
used for assigning drugs to indications as well as its benchmarking
performance, is available elsewhere.46−48,78 Briefly, in v1, we predicted interactions between 46,784 protein
structures and 3733 small molecules that mapped to 2030 indications.
We obtained the molecular structures of the 3733 small molecules in
our putative drug library from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
NCATS Chemical Genomics Center, and PubChem.88 Solved X-ray diffraction structures of proteins were obtained from
the Protein Data Bank,89 and modeled protein
structures were generated using I-TASSER.19 Approved drug-indication associations were obtained from the Comparative
Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)90 and mapped
to the CANDO drug library, resulting in 2030 indications with at least
one approved/associated compound. Protein–compound interaction
scores were calculated using a bio- and cheminformatic docking protocol
consisting of ligand binding site identification for all proteins
in our structure library followed by similarity measurement between
known ligands in the identified binding sites and all 3733 compounds
in our putative drug library.47 A compound
is characterized as an “interaction signature” of length
46,784, where each entry is an interaction score between 0 and 2,
indicating the strength of a predicted protein interaction (zero signifying
no interaction). Each compound is then compared to every other compound
by calculating the root–mean-square deviation (RMSD) between
the corresponding interaction signatures, generating a compound–compound
(or drug–compound) similarity matrix. Each compound is ranked
relative to every other compound in order of increasing similarity
and benchmarking performed.

Ligand-Based Pipelines
The CANDO
platform for shotgun
drug repurposing is not dependent on any particular method for determining
compound similarity, such as the protein-centric one used in v1. Here,
we consider the utility of ligand-based pipelines by constructing
two-dimensional molecular fingerprints of the 3733 compounds in the
CANDO putative drug library using the open-source cheminformatics
software RDKit Python API31 and performing
an all-against-all comparison using the Tanimoto coefficient. Once
the features of a molecule have been quantized into a vector, the
Tanimoto coefficient is a score of how many bits two vectors have
in common divided by the number of bits by which they differ, that
is, |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|, where A and B represent compounds in a binary vector form, and |X| is the length of any vector X.

For efficiency and accuracy, we described our putative drug library
using well-studied 2D molecular fingerprints.45 Specifically, we used Morgan fingerprints,91 otherwise known as Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP; a circular
fingerprint), one Functional Class Fingerprint (FCFP; a functional
class fingerprint92), and fingerprints
from RDKit (RDK; a linear fingerprint). Circular fingerprints are
bit vector representations of compounds encoding the presence of molecular
substructures constructed outward from all starting positions (all
atoms) in a radial fashion, functional class fingerprints are binary
vectors that encode the presence of predefined “functional”
features of a compound, and linear fingerprints encode the presence
of molecular substructures built in a linear fashion from all possible
starting points (all atoms).63

All
fingerprints are additionally described by the length of the
molecular substructure (“radius” or “diameter”
depending on the type and implementation) captured. For instance,
ECFP4 is a fingerprint created using ECFP with diameter four. Specific
ligand-based pipelines in CANDO are identified according to the molecular
fingerprint used, that is, “ECFP4” refers to the CANDO
pipeline where compounds are represented using the ECFP4 molecular
fingerprint.

Hert et al. found that the optimal results for
quantifying relationships
between drug classes were achieved using ECFP4 fingerprints with similarities
calculated using the Tanimoto coefficient.60 We extended this to ligand-based drug repurposing using vectors
of 2048 bits instead of the 1024 used in Hert et al.60 We calculated the Tanimoto coefficient between the fingerprints
of all possible pairs of the 3733 compounds in our library and used
this to populate a compound–compound similarity matrix, just
as we did with the v1 pipeline, allowing us to sort and rank all compounds
relative to each other. Fingerprints could not be created for 12 of
the 3733 compounds in our putative drug library, which were generally
large compounds with metal chelation or long polymers. We then evaluated
benchmarking performance of the ligand-based pipelines as described
further below.

Data Fusion Pipelines
We combined
rankings from the
v1 pipeline with the new molecular fingerprint rankings using one
of the following criteria: lower of two rankings (MIN), higher of
two rankings (MAX), sum of two rankings (SUM), and average of two
rankings (AVG). This is known as “rank-based data fusion”.93 We also combined the compound–compound
similarity scores from v1 and the ligand-based pipelines using the
multiplication of raw similarity scores (MUL), a type of “kernel-based
data fusion”.93 After multiplying
the similarity scores from two pipelines, the compounds are sorted
and ranked based on the newly calculated scores. As in v1 and the
ligand-based pipelines, the compound–compound rankings from
these data fusion pipelines are then subjected to benchmarking.

Decision Tree Pipeline
One goal of CANDO is to make
predictions of which compounds are likely to be efficacious against
any particular indication. The second goal is to use analytics to
identify causal relationships that predict indication etiology. From
the benchmarking, we can determine a priori the pipeline that has
the best performance for a particular indication, which are then used
to generate putative drug candidates for that indication. We constructed
a new meta pipeline that makes a decision as to optimal performance
on a per indication basis. We made this decision using the average
indication accuracy metric (described below) from two pipelines: v1
and the best performing ligand-based pipeline, ECFP4 (see Results). We used this to create a merged set of
data that was then benchmarked. For example, the v1 pipeline yields
a top10 average indication accuracy of 25% for type 2 diabetes, whereas
ECFP4 yields a top10 accuracy of 35%. In the combined decision tree
pipeline at the top10 cutoff, we chose to use ECFP4 for the prediction
of repurposing candidates for type 2 diabetes. The choice of other
cutoffs is based on whichever pipeline obtains a higher average indication
accuracy at that cutoff. The calculation of the other two benchmarking
performance metrics is based on the data from the corresponding pipeline
chosen in the previous step. We extended this method of choosing the
pipeline (between v1 and ECFP4) with higher average indication accuracy
to all indications. This aligns with the logic that a clinician or
researcher using CANDO can choose the pipeline with the highest accuracy
for a particular indication, which is reflected in the benchmarking
performance of this combined pipeline.

Benchmarking Pipelines
in the CANDO Platform
In contrast
to virtual screening experiments, our input data is human use drugs,
and the performance evaluation is against known drug-indication associations.
Three measures are used to perform the leave-one-out benchmarking
of the CANDO platform pipelines: average indication accuracy, pairwise
accuracy, and coverage. Average indication accuracy (%) evaluates
the likelihood of capturing at least one drug mapped to the same indication
within a particular cutoff from the list of compounds ranked in order
of similarity, which is averaged over the 1439 indications with at
least two approved drugs and expressed as percent (%). Mathematically,
this is expressed as c/d ×
100, where c is the number of times at least one
other drug approved for the same indication was captured within a
cutoff, and d is the total number of drugs approved
for that indication. The top10, top25, top1% (top37), top50, and top100
cutoffs are used, signifying the top ranking 10–100 similar
compounds. In other words, the indication accuracy represents the
recovery rate of known drugs for a particular indication, which is
then averaged across all 1439 indications with at least two approved
drugs. Pairwise accuracy (%) is the weighted average of the per indication
accuracies based on the number of compounds approved for a given indication.
Coverage is the number of indications with nonzero accuracy expressed
as percent (%).

Controls
The performance of a given
pipeline is evaluated
relative to a random control, which is the result that we would expect
by chance. The original random control data for v1 was generated by
repeated creation of random compound–proteome interaction matrices
by sampling from the distribution of values present in the v1 matrix.
The benchmarking performance for these random control matrices was
calculated as described above and by Sethi et al. and Mangione et
al.47,78 However, the new ligand-centric pipeline
is protein-agnostic, and the data fusion ones consist of protein-agnostic
components. Therefore, we constructed a compound–compound matrix
of uniformly random similarity scores to use as controls in this study,
that is, the similarity between any two compounds was assigned a random
value between 0 and 1. We sorted and ranked every compound relative
to every other compound using this this random compound–compound
similarity matrix and evaluated benchmarking performance as described
above.
