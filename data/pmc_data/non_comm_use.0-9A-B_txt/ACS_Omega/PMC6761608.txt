Throughout evolution, the presence
of a single G3·U70 mismatch
in the acceptor stem of tRNAAla is the major determinant
for aminoacylation with alanine by alanyl–tRNA synthetase (AlaRS).
Recently reported crystal structures of the complexes AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 and AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70
suggest two very different conformations, representing a reactive
and a nonreactive state, respectively. On the basis of these structures,
it has been proposed that the G3·U70 base pair guides the −CCA
end of the tRNA acceptor stem into the active site of AlaRS, thereby
enabling aminoacylation. The crystal structures open up the possibility
of directly computing the energetics of tRNA specificity by AlaRS.
We have carried out molecular dynamics free-energy simulations to
quantitatively estimate tRNA discrimination by AlaRS, focusing on
the mutations of the single critical base pair G3·U70 to uncover
the energetics underlying the accuracy of tRNA selection. The calculations
show that the reactive complex is highly selective in favor of the
cognate tRNAAla/G3·U70 over its noncognate analogues
(A3·U70/G3·C70/A3·C70). In contrast, the nonreactive
complex is predicted to be unselective between tRNAAla/G3·U70
and tRNAAla/A3·U70. Utilizing our calculated relative
binding free energies, we show how a simple three-step kinetic scheme
for aminoacylation, involving both an initial nonspecific binding
step and a subsequent transition to a selective reactive complex,
accounts for the observed kinetics of the process.

Introduction
Correct amino acid
attachment to its cognate tRNA followed by correct
mRNA–tRNA interaction during mRNA decoding on the ribosome
ensures the accuracy of genetic code translation. An aminoacyl–tRNA
synthetase (aaRS) selects its cognate tRNA and ligates the correct
amino acid at the 3′-CCA end with an extremely high specificity,
corresponding to an error rate of 10–4–10–5.1 A set of structural
elements in the tRNA (identity set) is recognized by aaRS for cognate
tRNA selection.2−7 For alanine tRNA (tRNAAla), a single wobble G3·U70
base pair in the acceptor stem away from the anticodon triplet (Figure 1a) is the major determinant
of the tRNA identity8−10 and is recognized by alanyl–tRNA synthetase
(AlaRS) in all kingdoms of life.11 Mutation
of the G3·U70 pair thus diminishes the aminoacylation with alanine
by AlaRS.12 On the other hand, transfer
of the G3·U70 pair to small RNAs (acceptor stem mimics of tRNAs),
tRNACys and tRNAPhe, enables alanine charging
by AlaRS.2,8,9,13−18 Wobble G·U pairs constitute an important structural element
of tRNA architecture and are related to the function of RNA in diverse
biological systems.19−21

Crystal structures of AlaRS from Arachaeoglobus
fulgidus in complex with native tRNAAla (tRNAAla/G·U) and the mutated variant with A3·U70
(tRNAAla/A·U),22 in complex
with the alanyl-adenylate analogue, 5′-O-[N-(l-alanyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine (Ala-SA),23 have recently been reported (Figure 1). These structures suggested
an explanation to the long-standing mystery of the strict specificity
of AlaRS for tRNAAla containing the conserved G3·U70
wobble pair.22 In the AlaRS–tRNAAla/G·U complex, the 3′-CCA end of tRNAAla has reached into the active site (reactive complex: R) where aminoacylation
can occur, whereas in the AlaRS–tRNAAla/A·U
complex, the 3′-CCA end of tRNAAla folds back into
a different route away from the active site (nonreactive complex:
NR) (Figure 1b). Flexible
domains allow proteins to access multiple conformational states and
the highly mobile loop region of AlaRS that spans the minor groove
of the acceptor stem (residues 470–490 with an average backbone B-factor ≈ 195 Å2)22 might have a prominent role in selectivity (Figure 1b). An interesting feature
of the G3·U70 wobble geometry is the availability of the exocyclic
−NH2 group of G3 in the minor groove, and O4 of
U70 in the major groove, for hydrogen-bonding interaction with the
protein. AlaRS is thus able to establish a specific interaction network
with G3·U70 both in the major and minor grooves to recognize
the tRNA for alanine acylation. Other base pairs such as A3·U70,
G3·C70, and A3·C70 change the shape of major/minor grooves
and alter the mode of stacking and hydrogen bonding (Figure 1c).

The crystal structures
show that the interaction between AlaRS
and the major and minor grooves of the G3·U70 base pair is disrupted
in the A3·U70 variant.22 It has also
been suggested that the geometrical difference between G3·U70
and A3·U70 propagates to the 3′-CCA end of tRNAAla, resulting in distinctly different orientations of the acceptor
stem to yield the reactive conformation for tRNAAla/G·U
and the nonreactive one for tRNAAla/A·U. The proposed
mechanism gives a clue to how a small difference in sequence away
from the anticodon may result in tRNAAla specificity at
the kcat level.22 The ratio of kcat for aminoacylation
between the G3·U70 and A3·U70 variants of tRNAAla is approximately 100-fold.22 Interestingly,
many other proteins similar to the editing domain of class II aaRSs
have also been isolated, which can edit misacylated tRNAs even after
they have been released from the synthetase.24−27

The difference between
the R and NR complexes is mainly characterized
by the alternate orientations of the 3′-CCA end of tRNAAla as the AlaRS structure is very similar in the two medium-resolution
(∼3.4 Å) X-ray structures.22 However, several key issues regarding the tRNAAla specificity
of AlaRS remain unclear. For example, the replacement of G3·U70
by A3·U70 could perhaps already change the conformational preference
of the CCA end (NR over R) of free tRNAAla in water, leading
to the NR complex upon AlaRS binding. Another question is how strongly
the cognate tRNAAla G3·U70 wobble pair is preferred
with respect to its variants (A3·U70, G3·C70, and A3·C70)
by AlaRS in the R conformation and whether or not it is also preferred
in NR. Moreover, the structures of noncognate complexes such as those
containing G3·C70 or A3·C70 have not been resolved experimentally.
The near-atomic resolution crystallographic complexes,22 however, now provide sufficiently good models
for structure-based computational evaluation of the energetics associated
with the states they are trapped in (R and NR). Here, we report molecular
dynamics (MD) free-energy calculations of cognate and near-cognate
AlaRS–tRNAAla complexes to examine how the energetics
of tRNA binding is affected by different variants of the 3.70 base
pair in the reactive and nonreactive conformations. The quantitative
estimation of tRNAAla specificity by AlaRS offers a simple
view of how fidelity in the aminoacylation process is achieved, thereby
establishing a link among three-dimensional (3D) structures, thermodynamics,
and experimentally measured kinetics.

Methods and Simulation
Details
MD Procedure
The MD procedure is described in Figure S1. The structures of tRNAAla bound to AlaRS, in the reactive and nonreactive conformations, were
taken from the Protein Data Bank (pdb codes 3WQY and 3WQZ, with crystallographic
resolutions of 3.3 and 3.49 Å, respectively). Spherical systems
with radius 25 Å, centered on the N9 atom of the G3/A3 nucleotide
of tRNAAla, were cut out from the crystallographic structures
and used for MD simulations. Harmonic positional restraints to experimental
coordinates were then applied to all heavy atoms in the “buffer
region” between 22 and 25 Å from the sphere center. The
force constants of the restraints in the buffer region were increased
linearly between 3.0 and 5.0 kcal/mol/Å2 in the direction
toward the outer boundary. The inner 22 Å radius sphere was treated
as fully flexible in the production of MD simulations. This system
was solvated by overlaying a cubic water box with an edge length 80
Å, where water which overlapped with AlaRS–tRNA was removed.
This yielded a total of about 49 000 atoms in the simulations,
which included ∼14 900 water molecules. Periodic boundary
conditions (using the particle mesh Ewald method28) for electrostatics with tinfoil boundary conditions29,30 were used for running MD simulations. van der Waals interactions
were truncated with a 16 Å cutoff. Temperature and pressure were
kept at 310 K and 1 bar, respectively. Langevin dynamics31 for nonhydrogen atoms with a coupling coefficient
of 5 ps–1 were used to control the temperature.
The pressure was controlled by a Langevin piston using the Nose–Hoover
method.32 The CHARMM36 force field33−37 and TIP3P water model38 were used for
running MD simulations. Simulations were performed using the CHARMM39,40 and NAMD41 programs. For each simulation
model, we ran 5–10 replicas starting with different initial
velocity distributions. Each replica involved 340 ps of equilibration
(where the system was heated up to 310 K in the initial stages and
then kept fixed throughout the simulations), followed by at least
4 ns production dynamics. Overall, 240–360 ns of production
dynamics distributed over 5–10 replicas were considered for
structural analysis for the AlaRS–tRNA complex and free tRNA
in water. In the initial stage of equilibration, harmonic restraint
was applied to the inner region (within 22 Å) with a force constant
of 4.0 kcal/mol/Å2, and at the final stage of equilibration,
the restraint (within 22 Å) was completely removed. The simulation
models were overall neutral, which was achieved by scaling the partial
charges of the phosphate backbone of tRNA. The X-ray structures of
AlaRS–tRNA complexes do not contain counterions within the
reduced 25 Å truncated model. Hence, instead of placing the counterions
at random locations, we mimicked the backbone neutralization by scaling
down the partial charges of the RNA phosphates which are away from
the 3.70 pair. The charges of the RNA base pair undergoing mutation
(i.e., 3.70) and its nearby base pairs (2.71, 4.69, and 5.68) were
not modified. The truncated 25 Å model centered at N9 of A3/G3
was neutralized by adding a +1 charge distributed over four atoms
of the phosphate group of RNA residues (Table S1) present outside 13.4 Å from the center. Bond lengths
between hydrogen and heavy atoms were constrained by the ShakeH algorithm
implemented in NAMD41 with an allowable
bond-length deviation of 1.0 × 10–8 Å.
A 2 fs time step was used for performing MD simulations. RMSD and
RMSF of heavy atoms within 22 Å of unrestrained simulation sphere
were calculated with respect to the X-ray structure, and the average
RMSD and RMSF were calculated over the last 5 ns of the 7 ns MD trajectory
with a 1 ps interval.

Free-Energy Calculations
Relative
binding free energies
(ΔΔGbind) for tRNA mutations
in the AlaRS–tRNA complexes (R and NR) were calculated by alchemically
transforming G3/A3/U70 into A3/G3/C70 (horizontal legs of the thermodynamic
cycle in Figure 2a).
The vertical legs of the thermodynamic cycle correspond to tRNA binding
and the horizontal legs correspond to the alchemical transformation
of tRNA (Figure 2a).
It should be noted that the horizontal paths (alchemical transformation)
cannot be realized experimentally. We computed the free-energy changes
along the alchemical transformations (ΔGcomp and ΔGfree) and calculated
the relative binding free energy as ΔΔGbind = ΔGcomp –
ΔGfree = ΔGA3·U70bind – ΔGG3·U70bind. We used a hybrid energy function
(U) which represents a mixture of two endpoint states
of the horizontal leg (Figure 2a), as applied in previous studies.42−46 The coupling parameter λ connects the end states
by modifying the electrostatics, van der Waals energy, and bonded
terms. Changing λ from 1 to 0 thus transforms AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 into AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70
by means of the mapping energy function: U = λU(G3) + (1 – λ)U(A3). The
free-energy derivative was calculated as ∂G/∂λ = ⟨∂U/∂λ⟩λ = ⟨U(λ = 1) – U(λ = 0)⟩λ, where the brackets
“⟨ ⟩” represent averaging over an MD trajectory
for a particular value of λ. For the alchemical transformation
of G3 into A3, we used 17 λ values between 1 and 0 (1.0, 0.999,
0.99, 0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01,
0.001, and 0.0), whereas for the transformation of U70 into C70, we
used 11 equally spaced λ values between 1 and 0 (1.0, 0.9, 0.8,
0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0). The free-energy derivative
at each λ was calculated by computing the difference ⟨U(λ = 1) – U(λ = 0)⟩λ. Each λ window simulation lasted for 1–2
ns, and the data from the last 600–1600 ps were used for averaging.
Numerical integration (with the standard trapezoidal method) was used
for calculating the free-energy change. The last 600–1600 ps
of the trajectory at each λ was divided into two batches, and
the deviation of the batch averages was reported as an uncertainty
associated with the free-energy derivatives. The same is reported
as the statistical error associated with the calculated ΔGcomp or ΔGfree for each run. The average result obtained from 5 to 10 trajectories
is used for computing ΔΔG. The uncertainty
in the averaged ΔG is reported as the standard
error of the mean (from 5 to 10 replicas), and the error in the final
ΔΔG in the manuscript is calculated by
propagating the standard error of the mean associated with the averaged
ΔG (Figure 2b). The uncertainty in the averaged ΔG (∼1.0 kcal/mol) is well within the acceptable statistical
uncertainty.45 Free energies were calculated
for the forward and reverse alchemical transformations (say G3 →
A3 and A3 → G3) in tRNA, either in complex with AlaRS or free
in water (Table S2). The results were averaged
over the forward and backward runs, except for the reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 complex (Table S2). A relatively large hysteresis (difference between the G3 →
A3 and A3 → G3 runs) was observed (Table S2a) only in the reactive complex (∼5 kcal/mol), and
hence averaging was done based on the forward runs. The reverse alchemical
transformation (AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 →
AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70) in the reactive complex
could not disrupt the salt bridge Arg483–Asp450 interaction
and get back the G3–Asp450 interaction (Figure S2), which causes the hysteresis. A reasonable estimate
of the free energy of G → A transformation in the reactive
complex is only possible to obtain from the forward runs. The reverse
runs (A → G) in the reactive conformation do not end up in
the X-ray structure (Figure S2), which
makes it necessary to discard these for reliable free-energy estimates.
To minimize the hysteresis, we have extended MD simulations at 8λ
windows (which showed a significant deviation between the forward
and reverse free-energy derivatives) of the reverse run by 10–20
ns each. The hysteresis was reduced from ∼5 to ∼2 kcal/mol,
as a result of long MD simulations (distributed over 117 ns alchemical
free-energy simulations). However, the hysteresis was not eliminated.
Disruption of the salt-bridge interaction between Asp450 and Arg483
seems to be a remedy in solving the hysteresis issue. Hence, we mutated
Arg483 → Ala483 in the reactive complex (model R#) and performed
G3.U70 → A3.U70 (forward) and A3.U70 → G3.U70 (reverse)
and found almost no hysteresis (∼0.6 kcal/mol) and ΔΔG = 3.3 kcal/mol. Thus, it can be argued that R# does not
have hysteresis problem but still yields strong discrimination.

horizontal legs correspond to the alchemical transformation of the
identity base pair, either in the solvated protein (upper leg) or

containing the identity base pair G3·U70 and its variants (A3·U70,
G3·C70, and A3·C70). Red and gray bars denote reactive and
nonreactive states, respectively. Binding free energies are in kcal/mol
and standard error is shown as vertical bars (black line) in parentheses.

The free-energy calculations for each system were
based on 340–880
ns of MD data averaged over 5–10 replicas with different initial
velocities. Overall, a total of about 2 μs of MD free-energy
simulations have been done to get a good convergence and a reasonable
standard error of the mean (<1 kcal/mol). To compute the binding
free-energy difference between G3·U70 and A3·C70, we performed
direct calculations for two different paths, G3·U70 →
A3·U70 and A3·U70 → A3·C70, and the result was
then obtained indirectly from the free energies obtained from these
two direct paths. As an additional check, the free-energy calculations
for G → A in the reactive complex (ΔGcomp of Figure 2a) were also performed with a smaller water box with a 70
Å side. The computed ΔGcomp values are virtually identical for the two different water box sizes.
The robustness of the calculated energetics was examined by repeating
the calculations for G3.U70 → A3.U70 and G3.U70 → G3.C70
transformations (in reactive complex, free tRNA) with different MD
setups, viz. (a) spherical droplets instead of water box; (b) considering
explicit Na+ ions for neutralization instead of scaled-down
phosphate charges in a water box. The calculated energetics are found
to be robust and independent of the box size, solvation protocol,
and statistical methods employed in extracting free energies.

Results
Structure-Based
Energetics of tRNAAla Selectivity
in AlaRS
To compute the energetics of AlaRS binding specificity
for tRNAAla and elucidate the roles of the different conformational
states (R and NR) in tRNA selection, we carried out MD simulations
of tRNAAla/G·U and its variants (tRNAAla/A·U, tRNAAla/G·C, and tRNAAla/A·C)
in complex with AlaRS and free in water (Figure 2a), using both reactive and nonreactive crystallographic
structures22 as starting points. These
calculations involve computing the change in the binding affinity
of AlaRS for tRNAAla upon G3·U70 → A3·U70,
G3·U70 → G3·C70, and A3·U70 → A3·C70
mutations in both the reactive and nonreactive complexes (Figure 2b). The results reveal
several remarkable features. First, the reactive complex strongly
favors tRNAAla/G·U with respect to the A·U variant
(ΔΔGbind ≈ 5 kcal/mol).
The nonreactive state is almost nonselective between tRNAAla/G·U and tRNAAla/A·U (ΔΔGbind ≈ 0.1 kcal/mol). Hence, the conformational
change from NR to R can boost the discrimination strength (by ΔΔGbind ≈ 5 kcal/mol) between the cognate
tRNAAla/G·U and near-cognate tRNAAla/A·U,
favoring the former. Second, both the reactive and nonreactive conformations
disfavor the noncognate tRNAAla/G·C with an equal
strength of ∼5 kcal/mol compared to the cognate tRNAAla/G·U. Third, the reactive complex shows the highest discriminatory
power for tRNAAla/A·C rejection. Fourth, the difference
in the discrimination strength between the reactive and nonreactive
complexes can thus be linked with the purine (A3/G3)–AlaRS
interaction.

Consideration of the free unbound tRNA in water
is essential for understanding tRNA binding to AlaRS. Local geometrical
differences between G3·U70 and A3·U70 in the free tRNAAla might alter the conformational preference (i.e., the orientation
of the 3′-CCA arm of tRNA leading to reactive or nonreactive
conformation) of the free tRNAAla in water. To understand
the energetics of the conformational change in the free tRNAAla, we have also compared the mutation free energies for G3·U70
→ A3·U70 in the reactive and nonreactive conformations
of free tRNAAla in solution using the appropriate thermodynamic
cycle (Figure S3). The very small computed
ΔΔGfreeNR→R ≈ −0.2 ± 0.9
kcal/mol suggests that the geometrical difference between G3·U70
and A3·U70 does not play any significant role in driving the
conformational change (NR ⇆ R) in the free tRNAAla in water.

X-ray Versus MD Structures of AlaRS–tRNAAla Complexes
The crystal structure22 of the reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70
(Figure 3a) complex
shows
a double hydrogen-bonded G3·U70 wobble base pair. This wobble
pair forms H-bonds with AlaRS involving its major (U70–O4 with
Asn359) and minor (G3–N2 with Asp450) groove sides. The 2′-OH
group of C4 forms an H-bond with the side chain of Ser451 in the minor
groove and C71–N4 with the main chain carbonyl of Asn359 in
the major groove. The possibility of hydrogen bonding between the
2′-OH group of C71 and the side chain of Asp450 has also been
suggested.22 In the nonreactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 complex (Figure 3b), A3 shifted upward away from the minor groove and
U70 shifted downward away from the major groove, disrupting the tRNA–enzyme
major–minor groove interactions. In the nonreactive complex,
A76 at the 3′-CCA terminal of tRNAAla is placed
near A3 (∼9 Å), whereas in the reactive complex (Figure 3a), A76 is over 30
Å away from G3.

Figure 3 Structural insights from the X-ray and MD simulations
of the AlaRS–tRNAAla complex. The 3.70 base pair
is represented by sticks at
the center; C4, C71, and A76 are the tRNA nucleotides shown in lines.
The base of C4 has not been shown for clarity, and few hydrogens are
shown to clarify the H-bonds. Amino acid residues interacting with
the tRNA nucleotides are shown as sticks. (a) G3·U70–AlaRS
interaction proposed in the X-ray structure.22 (b) A3·U70–AlaRS interaction proposed in the X-ray structure;22 color code is the same as in Figure 1b. MD structures of the reactive
(left side) and nonreactive (right side) complexes are shown in (c–f),
where tRNA is shown in yellow color and AlaRS in cyan color. Water
is indicated by red spheres.

The equilibrated MD structures of G3·U70 and A3·U70 in
complex with AlaRS (Figure 3c,d) are very similar to their corresponding template X-ray22 structures (Figure 3a,b), with a small MD-averaged RMSD of ∼1.9
Å, with a standard deviation of less than 0.2 Å. The loop
region (Figure 1b)
is highly flexible and its averaged RMSF is considerably large (Figures S4 and S5).

The robust structural
features observed in our MD structures (Figure 3c,d) are as follows:
(i) U70–O4 always makes an H-bond with the side chain Asn359
in both the reactive G3·U70 and nonreactive A3·U70 complexes;
(ii) the side chain of Asn359 forms a stable H-bond with the main
chain NH group of Asp727; this interaction locks the conformation
of the Asn359 side chain such that its side chain −NH2 points toward O4 of U70; (iii) the 2′-OH group of U70 forms an H-bond with the ribose ring oxygen
of C71 and/or the backbone of Asp450; and (iv) the side chain of Arg483
of the highly flexible loop region (Figure 1b) forms a direct salt-bridge interaction
with the side chain of Asp450 in the nonreactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 complex (Figure 3d) but not in the reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 case (Figure 3c). The 2′-OH groups of C71 and C4 of tRNA form water-mediated/direct
interactions with Asp450 and Ser451, respectively, in the minor groove
of the reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 complex
(Figure 3c). This might
indicate the importance of the 2′-OH group of the nearby nucleotides
in the overall structural stability leading to facile alanylation.15

MD Structures of NonCognate AlaRS–tRNAAla Complexes
The reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 (Figure 3e) and nonreactive
AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 (Figure 3f) complexes were modeled by alchemically
mutating G3/A3 into A3/G3 in the experimentally resolved reactive/nonreactive
complex. The alchemical transformation AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 → AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70
in the reactive complex (Figure 3e) results in the disruption of the G3–Asp450
interaction and the formation of an Arg483–Asp450 salt bridge.
Note that the Arg483–Asp450 interaction in the reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 complex (Figure 3e) is the same as in the nonreactive complex (Figure 3d), suggesting that
the G3 → A3 mutation in the reactive complex might reorient
the Arg483 side chain, resulting in the Arg483–Asp450 salt
bridge.

The nonreactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70
complex (Figure 3f)
shows almost the same interaction pattern as seen in the reactive
complex (Figure 3d),
except for the formation of a water-mediated interaction between Asp450
and Arg483. A loss of the interaction between C70 and Asn359 in the
major groove is observed in the G3·C70 and A3·C70 complexes
(Figure 4) because
of the electrostatic repulsion. In complexes with the A3·C70
mismatch (Figure 4c,d),
A3 is shifted upward toward the major groove, whereas C70 is shifted
downward toward the minor groove, thereby disrupting the interactions
in the major and minor grooves. It should be noted that the Asp450–Arg483
salt-bridge interaction in the nonreactive state is consistently observed
in the MD trajectories (Figures 3d,f and 4b,d).

(right side: b,d) complexes with tRNA containing G3·C70 and A3·C70
base pairs. Representation and color coding are the same as in Figure 3c–f.

Structure-Based Energetics and Its Connection
to Kinetics
A key question is how the calculated structure-based
energetics
of Figure 2b is related
to the observed kinetics. Our calculations suggest that the reactive
complex strongly prefers tRNAAla/G3·U70 with respect
to its A3·U70 variant, whereas the nonreactive complex is nonselective
or only very weakly prefers the latter. It should be noted that alanine
charging by AlaRS is also possible for G3·U70 containing mini-
or microhelices13,18 with a substantially increased
Michaelis constant (KM) but an almost
unaffected kcat. This suggests that all
the helices containing G3·U70 undergo aminoacylation at a comparable
rate once they are bound to the enzyme. A3·U70 in mini-/microhelices
completely failed to demonstrate any aminoacylation by alanine, even
after prolonged incubation with substrate-level enzyme concentration.12,13,18 Recently, an approximately 100-fold
difference in kcat was reported between
wild-type tRNAAla/G3·U70 and tRNAAla/A3·U70,
whereas the KM values were relatively
similar. Moreover, single turnover measurements22 revealed that both the rate of the chemical step and the
binding affinity were similar for the two cases, with differences
being much smaller than the 2 orders of magnitude effect on kcat. To account for this observation, a kinetic
model was proposed where the substrate can bind reversibly in both
reactive and nonreactive conformations, which can also interconvert
on the enzyme. After an irreversible aminoacyl transfer step occurring
from the reactive state, the system ends up in the reactive-bound
product state where the product can either dissociate directly or
via the nonreactive conformation, all these later steps being reversible.
This complex model, with no less than 13 adjustable rate parameters,
was fitted to the pre-steady-state kinetic curves.22 However, although this model correctly predicts the 100-fold
change in kcat, a closer examination of
the resulting rate constants reveals that the kcat/KM and KM values clearly disagree with the experiments. Thus, the predicted KM for tRNAAla/A3·U70 is markedly
lower (0.03 μM) than that for tRNAAla/G3·U70
(0.9 μM) because of its strong binding to the NR state implied
by the model. Moreover, the fitted forward and reverse rate constants
for substrate binding in the reactive and nonreactive conformations
would also imply that the nonreactive state is more selective for
tRNAAla/A3·U70 (>3 kcal/mol) than the reactive
state
is for tRNAAla/G3·U70 (∼0.7 kcal/mol).22 This is clearly at variance with our free-energy
calculations based on the experimental crystal structures, which thus
are not consistent with the proposed kinetic model. Furthermore, both
the cognate and noncognate thermodynamic cycles connecting the free
enzyme to its substrate-bound states in the reactive and nonreactive
conformations are subject to an ∼2 kcal/mol closure error,
if the fitted rate constants are used.

Application of Occam’s
razor to the present problem suggests that a much simpler kinetic
model, based on our calculated selectivities of the reactive and nonreactive
states, can better account for the observed data. Such a sequential
three-step model is shown in Figure 5, where an initial unselective binding step yields
a nonreactive complex (E·tRNANR), which can subsequently
reversibly convert to the reactive complex (E·tRNAR). Once formed, E·tRNAR undergoes aminoacylation
with the same rate, irrespective of whether the tRNA is cognate or
noncognate. According to our free-energy calculations, E·tRNAR is strongly selective for cognate tRNAAla/G3·U70,
and it is basically the different (Boltzmann) probabilities of reaching
this state that are responsible for the observed difference in kcat. A key feature is also that the initial
E·tRNANR state does not show any significant kinetic
or thermodynamic discrimination between cognate and noncognate tRNAs.
It thus essentially has the same properties as those obtained here
for the crystallographic nonreactive state, which could be considered
as one example of an unspecific binding state. This scheme is thus
similar to that proposed for the initial selection of aminoacyl–tRNA
on the mRNA-programmed ribosome.46 Further,
the conformational change from the weakly selective nonreactive complex
to the highly selective reactive complex is proposed to be downhill
for cognate tRNAAla/G3·U70. The calculated energetics
then automatically places the reactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 complex uphill from its nonreactive state. This would
explain why the crystal structures only trap AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 in the reactive state and AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 in the nonreactive conformation. The kinetic
parameters of the proposed scheme (Figure 5) are thus 1  and 2  Here, the absolute magnitude of KM (and kcat/KM) is of course dependent on the effective association
rate constant k1, but the accuracy A = (kcat/KM)cognate/(kcat/KM)non-cognate is
independent of k1. By inserting the values
of k3 (aminoacylation step) in the correct
experimental range22,47 and adjusting k3 so as to get KM also in
the correct range, this model accounts well for the experimental kinetic
data when we insert our calculated values for the selectivities of
the NR and R states. A numerical example is shown in Table 1.

diagram for tRNAAla selection
by AlaRS (without proofreading). Illustration of how the nonselective
(nonreactive complex: NR) and highly selective (reactive complex:
R) states can be used to drive aminoacylation favoring cognate tRNA/G3·U70.
Binding free-energy differences between the cognate tRNA/G3·U70
and the noncognate tRNA/A3·U70 are approximately 0.1 and 5 kcal/mol
for NR and R complexes, respectively. The reactive complex (R) is
downhill for cognate tRNA/G3·U70 and uphill for noncognate tRNA/A3·U70
(see text). Biochemically plausible activation barriers for the elementary
steps are depicted as ∼14–16 kcal/mol and are assumed
to be the same for both the cognate and near-cognate tRNA.

Concluding Discussion
Kinetic and structural studies12,22 have certainly
enriched our understanding of tRNA selection by AlaRS. We are, nevertheless,
lacking a detailed structure-based free-energy landscape of tRNA selection
by the enzyme, as the link between the kinetics and 3D structure is
still missing. However, MD simulations should in principle be able
to fill this gap. Here, we have performed MD free-energy calculations
and computed the relative tRNAAla binding free energies
to AlaRS in the reactive and nonreactive complexes for various cases,
G3·U70, A3·U70, G3·C70, and A3·C70. It was found
that the reactive complex consistently disfavors A3·U70, G3·C70,
and A3·C70 with respect to the cognate tRNAAla/G3·U70
by ΔΔG over 5 kcal/mol. In contrast, the nonreactive complex
does not discriminate between A3·U70 and G3·U70, although
the discrimination against G3·C70 and A3·C70 is clearly
evident. The magnitudes of the relative binding free energies (ΔΔG) are experimentally unknown. Hence, our calculated relative
binding strengths cannot, at present, be compared to the experimental
data, but their magnitudes appear biochemically realistic.

MD
free-energy calculations adopted here have proven to be sufficiently
accurate for the quantitative prediction of base-pairing energetics
related to protein synthesis on ribosomes (including mRNA decoding
during initiation, elongation, termination, and the role of tRNA modification
in decoding, etc).48,49 The application of MD simulations
in studying RNA and DNA has been discussed extensively in the literature.50,51 A truncated spherical region (radii ≈ 25–40 Å)
cut out of the large molecular assembly and solvated by a spherical
droplet/box of explicit water is often the preferred model for performing
MD simulations.49−51 If the energetics is controlled by localized interactions,
then the reduced truncated model is a very good choice, which reduces
the computational cost and improves the convergence by not sampling
the irrelevant large-scale conformational motion.44−46,48,52,53 Large-scale conformational change certainly requires the consideration
of a much larger truncated/complete biomolecular system and exhaustive
sampling.

The reactive and nonreactive complexes are distinctly
different
in two aspects, the orientation of the tRNA 3′-CCA arm (as
described previously)22 and the RNA–protein
interactions in the minor groove. The 3′-CCA arm is placed
in the aminoacylation site only in the reactive complex and folded
back in the nonreactive complex (Figure 1b). The MD simulations suggest that the Arg483–Asp450
interaction in the minor groove is a unique feature of the nonreactive
complex, as it is evident from most of the MD runs. It should be noted
that the loop region (Figure 1b) containing Arg483 was poorly resolved (with a B-factor ≈ 195 Å2) in the X-ray structure.22 A different orientation of Arg483 in the reactive
and nonreactive complexes is also evident from the X-ray structures
(Figure S6). The large RMSF (Figure S4) obtained from the MD trajectories
further suggests a high flexibility of this loop region. On the other
hand, the Arg483–Asp450 salt bridge seems to be the characteristic
feature of the nonreactive AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70
complex (Figure S5) and is stable throughout
the trajectories of the nonreactive complex.

Interestingly,
the interaction between the negatively charged side
chain of Asp450 and the exocyclic −NH2 of G3 is
crucial for the stability of the native complex (Figure 3c) and a major reason for the
mutation of G3 to A3 leading to a large discrimination in the reactive
complex.

It should be noted that the forward alchemical transformation
of
AlaRS–tRNAAla/G3·U70 into AlaRS–tRNAAla/A3·U70 in the reactive complex (Figure 3e) spontaneously produces the Arg483–Asp450
salt bridge, which appears as a characteristic structural feature
of the nonreactive complex (Figure 3d). The NR conformation need not be unique, and different
conformations of the −CCA end could probably yield nonreactive
states with little selectivity (ΔΔG ≈
0 kcal/mol). Hence, the observed X-ray conformation of the NR complex
could be seen as one of those possibilities, and it seems clear that
it is the difference in the local environment around the 3.70 base
pair that is responsible for the differential selectivity.

We
have shown here how a simple three-state kinetic model (Figure 5) can explain how
the single wobble pair ensures tRNA specificity by altering kcat (favoring correct tRNA by ∼100-fold)
and keeping KM more or less similar (Table 1). The activation
barriers for the forward processes are considered to be identical
for the correct and incorrect tRNAs in this model. Hence, irreversible
amino acid attachment will take place once the “R” state
is reached, regardless of the nature of tRNA (correct or incorrect).
It is rather the differential probability of reaching the highly selective
“R” complex that gives different kcat values for correct and incorrect tRNA, thereby ensuring
accuracy in tRNA selection by AlaRS.
