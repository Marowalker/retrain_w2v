This
paper reports the effects of structural parameters on organic
liquid impregnation behavior into nanofibrous (NF) polymer membranes.
The NF membranes were prepared from organic liquidphilic polymers,
poly(amide-imide)s (PAIs), by electrospinning. The impregnation velocity
of the organic liquid, ethylmethylcarbonate, into the as-spun PAI
NF membranes with diameters ranging from 400 to 900 nm was approximately
10–20 times higher than that into commercial cellulose nonwoven
membranes. Our theoretical analyses based on the Kozeny–Carman
equation and multivariate statistics clearly indicate that in addition
to the porosity of the membranes, the variation in fiber diameter
as well as the average fiber diameter is a crucial factor for controlling
the liquid impregnation behavior.

Introduction
Electrospinning is
a straightforward and versatile method for the
formation of continuous thin fibers based on an electrohydrodynamic
process.1−3 This method has the following advantages: (i) it
is applicable to a broad spectrum of molecules, such as synthetic
polymers, biological polymers (e.g., proteins and DNAs), and inorganic
molecules; (ii) it has the ability to produce thin fibers with diameters
in the micrometer and nanometer ranges; and (iii) it enables one-step
formation of nanofibrous (NF) membranes (or nonwoven webs) with random
network structures. The membrane thickness can also be controlled
by the spinning duration. Electrospun NF membranes with high porosity,
an interconnected pore structure, and large surface-to-volume ratios
have recently attracted much attention in applications such as high-performance
air and liquid filter media, battery separators, electrode materials,
protective clothes, composites, drug delivery systems, and biomaterial
scaffolds for tissue engineering.1−9

Some researchers, including our group, reported unique wetting
behavior on the surface of electrospun NF membranes,10−12 such as excellent water repellency,12 excellent oil repellency,13 and a metastable
Cassie–Baxter wetting state.14,15 Their wetting
behaviors could be controlled by optimizing both the chemical composition
and the surface structure of the electrospun NF membranes (i.e., roughness
and porosity).12−16 For the practical applications of NF membranes as battery separators
and liquid filters, the liquid impregnation behavior as well as the
wetting behavior is important. For example, the initial liquid impregnation
into the membranes influences the production process: poor liquid
impregnation could delay the production time (i.e., takt time) or
reduce the production yields of cells or stacks due to insufficient
liquid filling.

To improve the liquid impregnation behavior
into NF membranes,
elucidation of the crucial factors for liquid impregnation behaviors
(e.g., topology of membrane structure, properties of the membrane
material and liquid) is strongly required. However, studies on organic
liquid impregnation behavior into NF membranes are very limited. This
lack of understanding prevents the establishment of a protocol for
rationally designing the NF membranes. Thus, in the present study,
the influence of NF membrane structures on the liquid impregnation
behavior was examined. We prepared NF polymer membranes using electrospinning.
In this study, commonly used organic liquidphilic polymers, poly(amide-imide)s
(PAIs), were used as the nanofiber material. In addition, we evaluated
the impregnation velocities of the organic liquid, ethylmethylcarbonate
(EMC), into the as-spun NF membranes with diameters ranging from 400
to 900 nm using time-resolved contact angle measurements.17 Herein, we attempted a first-approximation theoretical
analysis of liquid impregnation kinetics into nanofibrous porous media
based on the Kozeny–Carman equation18 for fibrous nonwovens and a practical theoretical analysis based
on multivariate statistics19 to investigate
the influence of the structural parameters of the membranes on the
liquid impregnation behavior.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
of NF Membranes
Figure 1 shows surface scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the prepared NF membranes. The
average fiber diameters (δ0) ± standard deviation
(σ) of the prepared NF membranes were 410 ± 60 nm for PAI-1,
750 ± 270 nm for PAI-2, 710 ± 112 nm for PAI-3, and 912
± 338 nm for PAI-4, whereas the δ0 ± σ
of 570 ± 438 nm for the reference cellulose nonwoven membrane.
The structural parameters (fiber diameter and porosity) and wetting
and impregnation properties (contact angle and impregnation time and
velocity) of the prepared PAI NF membranes and the cellulose nonwoven
membrane are summarized in Table 1. The impregnation velocity (v) for
the prepared PAI NF membranes was larger than that for the reference
cellulose nonwoven membrane; specifically, the v values
for the PAI NF membranes were 13–19 times larger than that
of the cellulose nonwoven membrane. This result is partly because
the porosity of the as-spun NF membranes (86–92%) is larger
than that of the reference cellulose nonwoven membrane (65%) (see Figure S3a). However, approximately 20–25%
porosity change does not allow a quantitative explanation of the significant
improvement in the EMC impregnation velocity in the range of 1300–1900%.
The v–δ0 relationship for
the NF membranes is shown in Figure S3b. The v value increased with an increase in the
δ0 value for the highly porous PAI NF membranes.

Theoretical Analysis of Impregnation Behavior
To investigate
the influence of three parameters (i.e., membrane porosity, fiber
diameter, and intrinsic contact angle of fiber material) on the liquid
impregnation velocity (v) into electrospun NF membranes,
we used the Kozeny–Carman equation, which describes the capillary
rise (h) of the fluid flowing through the porous
media,18 as follows 1  where ΔP is the pressure
difference across the porous medium, k is the Carman
constant, ε is the porosity, Sp is
the real specific surface area per unit volume of a porous medium,
and η is the fluid viscosity. The model NF membrane is shown
in Figure S4, and a detailed description
of the Kozeny–Carman equation for NF membranes is included
in the Supporting Information.

The
impregnation velocities (vcalc) for the
commercial cellulose separator and NF membranes were calculated by
the Kozeny–Carman equation for NF membranes (eq S11). For calculation, the experimental values of the porosity
and fiber diameter (see Table 1), the intrinsic contact angle of the fiber materials (see
the Supporting Information), and the solution
properties of EMC (density, ρL: 1015 [kg/m3]; viscosity, η: 0.65 [mPa s]; and surface tension, γL: 27.1 [mN/m])20 were used. Figure 2 shows a comparison
of the experimental and calculated values of the EMC impregnation
velocity into NF membranes. A distinct difference between the experimental
results and calculated results appears for all membranes except for
the PAI-1 NF membrane.

Figure 2 Experimental and calculated values of the impregnation
velocity
(v) into NF membranes. Calculations were carried
out using the minimum, average, and maximum fiber diameters.

To investigate the difference between the experimental
and calculated
values of the EMC impregnation velocity into NF membranes in detail,
the ratio (R) of the experimental impregnation velocity
(v) to the calculated one (vcalc) was plotted as a function of the standard deviation (σ)
of the fiber diameter, as shown in Figure 3. The R values showed a
negative correlation with the σ values: the R value increased toward unity with a decrease in the σ value.
This observation suggests that the variation in fiber diameter influences
the actual liquid impregnation behavior. Subsequently, we recalculated
the impregnation velocities using the minimum and maximum fiber diameters
instead of the average diameter. The minimum and maximum fiber diameters
are the minimum and maximum values obtained from the image analysis
of the SEM images of the electrospun fibers, respectively. The results
are shown in Figure 2. The experimental value roughly agrees with the value recalculated
using the minimum fiber diameter. In contrast, the difference between
the experimental and calculated values became larger when the maximum
fiber diameter was used for calculation. This result clearly indicates
that compared to the maximum fiber diameter, the minimum fiber diameter
is more suitable for describing the liquid impregnation velocity into
NF membranes.

Figure 3 Ratio (R) of the experimental impregnation
velocity
(v) to the calculated one (vcalc) for the NF membranes as a function of the standard deviation
(σ) of the fiber diameter.

To examine the reason why the value calculated using the minimum
fiber diameter agreed with the experimental value, we reconsidered
the Kozeny–Carman equation. In general, for the electrospun
NF membranes, the average fiber diameter, δ0, positively
correlates with the interfiber spacing, δ−δ0 (δ is the center–center distance between the
closet fibers; see Figure S4): a thinner
NF membrane has a smaller interfiber spacing.4 Therefore, we attempt to derive the relationship between δ0 and δ.

The total fiber length (L) is given as follows.   2  where Wf is the
weight of the NF membrane with a unit area, La × Lb is the area size of
the NF membrane, and ρf is the fiber density.

The porosity of the NF membrane (ε) is obtained by removing
the total fiber volume from the total volume of the NF membrane 3  where Lc is the
membrane thickness.

Equation 3 can be
rewritten as follows 4  From
the expression for the total volume of
NF membrane δ2L = La × Lb × Lc (see Figure S4),
the following equation can be obtained. 5  Finally, the relationship between δ0 and δ is obtained from eqs 2, 4, and 5. 6  The
liquid impregnation behavior into NF membranes
is significantly influenced by the interfiber spacing (pore size),
δ−δ0 = δ0{1 –
(π/4(1 – ε))1/2}. Figure 4 shows the schematic of the liquid impregnation
behavior into NF membranes prepared from liquidphilic materials with
different interfiber spacings. The impregnation velocities, v1 and v2, have the
following relationship (a detailed description for the deviation of eq 7 is included in the Supporting Information). 7  When the
spacing δ1–δ1,0 is smaller
than δ2–δ2,0, the velocity v1 is smaller
than v2. In other words, the impregnation
velocity slows down with a smaller interfiber spacing (pore size).
Therefore, when there is spacing distribution (i.e., fiber diameter
distribution) in the NF membranes, the small spacing formed locally
in the membranes substantially prevents fast liquid impregnation and
consequently decreases the apparent impregnation velocity into the
NF membrane by increasing the actual tortuosity. However, this mechanism
for the contribution of the minimum fiber diameter in an NF membrane
to the impregnation velocity is plausible. Since considering the effect
of the variation in fiber diameter based on the Kozeny–Carman
equation is difficult, we attempted a practical multivariate analysis
to examine the influence of the variation in fiber diameter on the
impregnation velocity.

membranes

Multivariate Statistical Analysis
To discuss the influence
of the variation in fiber diameter in detail, the relationship between
the structural parameters, i.e., average fiber diameter (δ0), porosity (ε), standard deviation of fiber diameter
(σ), and the impregnation velocity (v) was
quantitatively investigated by multivariate statistical analysis19,21,22 using software (JMP version 11.0.0,
SAS Institute Inc.). In this study, to improve the accuracy of our
multivariate statistical analysis, the data for an additional NF membrane
was used in addition to the data shown in Table 1 (more detailed information on our calculation
is included in the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 shows the relationship between
structural parameters (ε, δ0, σ) and
the impregnation velocity (v) obtained from our multivariate
analysis. The correlation coefficient R2 was 0.94, which was a relatively good value. Our analysis revealed
positive correlations between v and ε and between v and δ0. The latter correlation indicates
that the impregnation velocity slows down with a smaller interfiber
spacing because a thinner NF membrane has a smaller interfiber spacing.4 This reflection will not contradict the plausible
mechanism for the contribution of the minimum fiber diameter based
on eq 7. More interestingly,
there is a negative correlation between v and σ.

Figure 5 Relationship
between the structural parameters, porosity (ε),
average fiber diameter (δ0), and standard deviation
of fiber diameter (σ), and the impregnation velocity (v) obtained from multivariate statistical analysis.

In other words, the impregnation velocity (v)
increases with a decrease in the variation in the fiber diameter (σ).
The relationships among the impregnation velocity (v), average fiber diameter (δ0), and variation in
fiber (σ) diameter obtained from the multivariate statistical
analysis under a fixed porosity (ε) of 92% (the maximum value
for our calculation) are shown in Figure 6. The NF membrane with very small diameters
of less than 100 nm usually has inferior liquid impregnation properties.
However, this estimation clearly indicates the possibility that liquid
impregnation into NF membranes with very thin diameters can be improved
by the precisely controlling the fiber diameter during spinning. In
fact, we succeeded in preparing poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) NF
membranes with a narrow distribution of fiber diameter (δ0 ± σ = 240 ± 32 nm, ε = 90%) by precisely
controlling the charge density of the electrified liquid jet during
electrospinning based on the analysis of the direct observation using
a high-speed camera.3 The EMC impregnation
velocity was substantially improved to 9.7 from 6.0 mm/s for the PVDF
NF membrane with a broad fiber diameter distribution (δ0 ± σ = 230 ± 92 nm, ε = 90%).

Conclusions
In the present study, organic liquid impregnation
behaviors into
electrospun NF membranes were characterized and analyzed based on
the Kozeny–Carman equation and multivariate statistics. It
was revealed that the variation in the fiber diameter, the membrane
porosity, and the average fiber diameter are the determining factors
that control the actual liquid impregnation behavior. These results
provide the fundamental information for the rational design of electrospun
NF membranes and coatings utilized in application fields such as liquid
filters, diaphragms, battery separators, functional coatings, and
sensors.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(amide-imides)s with
average molecular
weights of 30 000 (PAI-30k for PAI-1 NF), 26 000 (PAI-26k
for PAI-2 NF), and 60 000 (PAI-60k for PAI-3 and PAI-4 NFs)
were purchased from Toyobo, Japan (PAI-30k and PAI-60k), and Hitachi
Chemical, Japan (PAI-26k), respectively. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC,
CMC Daicel Grade 1390) was obtained from Daicel FineChem Ltd., Japan. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc, semiconductor
grade) and ethylmethylcarbonate (EMC, semiconductor grade) were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan. These reagents were used
without further purification. A commercial cellulose nonwoven membrane
for a battery separator (Nanobase 2, Mitsubishi Paper Mills, Ltd.,
Japan) was used as the reference porous membrane for characterization.

Electrospinning
PAI-30k/DMAc (11.25 wt %) and PAI-26k/DMAc
(11.25 wt %) solutions and 29 and 30 wt % PAI-60k/DMAc solutions were
electrospun using a commercial device (NF-103, MECC, Japan). A stainless
steel nozzle (0.3 mm internal diameter, Unicontrols, Japan), connected
to a high-voltage regulated DC power supply, was used as the spinneret.
The grounded collector used as the counter electrode was an aluminum
plate (250 × 200 mm2). The applied voltage was 40
kV, the distance between the nozzle tip and the collector was 135
mm, and the flow rate was 16.6 μL/min for PAIs. All electrospinning
procedures were carried out at 28–33 °C and at 20–30%
relative humidity. The thicknesses of all the prepared NF membranes
are approximately 20 ± 1 μm.

Characterization
The surface morphologies of the prepared
NF membranes were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM,
S-2000, Hitachi High Technologies, Japan) operated at 0.7–5
kV. The average fiber diameter was determined by SEM image analysis.
The weight and thickness of the membranes were determined using an
analytical balance (HR-202i, A&D, Japan) and a height gauge (digimatic
indicator ID-H, Mitutoyo, Japan), respectively. The apparent membrane
porosity (ε) was determined as follows 8  where Wf is the
basis weight of membrane, the weight per the unit area (1 × 1
cm2); ρf is fiber density; and Lc is the membrane thickness. The measurements
were carried out 3 times for each membrane, and the mean value (±standard
deviation) is indicated.

The time courses of the contact angle
measurements were also measured using a DropMaster 500 (Kyowa Interface
Science Co., Japan) at approximately 25 °C (Figure S1). An organic liquid (EMC) droplet with a volume
of 0.2 μL was used as a probe liquid. The impregnation velocity
(v) was determined by the measured impregnation time
(t) required for the contact angle to reach zero
degrees after the deposition of the droplet. For the thin-film NF
membranes, at t, the cylindrical liquid permeation
(wetting) region is always formed because Lc is much smaller than the apparent flow distance (see Figure S2, more detailed information is given
in the Supporting Information). Here, we
determined the apparent impregnation velocity based on these experimental
results. At t, the apparent permeation volume reaches
the droplet volume divided by the apparent membrane porosity (ε).
Therefore, the apparent permeation volume can be expressed as (v × t)2 × π
× Lc. Consequently, v is given as follows 9  where the droplet volume is 0.2 μL and
the membrane thickness (Lc) is 20 μm.
The measurements were carried out 5 times for each membrane, and the
mean value (±standard deviation) is indicated. In this study,
we used fiber materials with the low intrinsic contact angles of 3.3–6.6°
(a detailed description is included in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the chemical effects of fiber materials
on the liquid impregnation behavior are negligible. In addition, we
used EMC, which is a commonly used solvent for electrolyte of lithium-ion
batteries, as a model organic solvent. The surface tension of EMC
is 27.1 mN/m at 20 °C20 and is in
the range of representative organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, acetone,
cyclohexane, and benzene), which is 20–30 mN/m at room temperature.
