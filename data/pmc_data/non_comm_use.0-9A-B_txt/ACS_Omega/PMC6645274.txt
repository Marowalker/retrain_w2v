Demands related to
clean energy and environmental protection promote
the development of novel supramolecular assemblies for photocatalysis.
Because of the distinctive aggregation behaviors, bolaamphiphiles
with two hydrophilic end groups could be theoretically the right candidates
for the fabrication of high-performance photocatalysis. However, photocatalytic
applications based on bolaamphiphilic assemblies were still rarely
investigated. Especially, the relationship between diverse assembled
nanostructures and the properties for different applications is urgently
needed to be studied. Herein, we demonstrate that using the hierarchical
assembly of bolaamphiphiles could correctly induce the porphyrin supramolecular
architectures with much better photocatalytic performances than the
aggregations containing 450 times of the porphyrin molecules, even
though both molecular structures as well as the J-aggregations of
porphyrin building blocks are same in two different systems. Thus,
the co-assembly of l-phenylalanine terminated bolaamphiphile
(Bola-F) and the porphyrin containing four hydroxyl groups (tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin)
can form microtube in methanol and forms fibers/spheres in methanol/water
mixture. For catalyzing the photodegradation of rhodamine B, the small
amount of J-aggregated porphyrin within Bola-F microtubes show much
better photocatalytic performance comparing with that of huge porphyrin
J-aggregations in fibers/spheres. The supramolecular assemblies as
well as the photocatalysis were thoroughly characterized by different
spectroscopies and electron microscopy. It is demonstrated that the
co-assembly with bolaamphiphiles could inhibit the energy transfer
of porphyrin aggregation and subsequently benefit the electron transfer
and corresponding photocatalysis under photo-irradiation. This work
is not only useful for further understanding the hierarchically supramolecular
assembly but also provides a new strategy for making novel functional
supramolecular architectures based on the assembly of bolaamphiphiles
and porphyrins.

Introduction
The existence and evolution
of life is considered to be dependent
on the nanostructures and functions of biological membranes, which
are the assemblies of phospholipids, a type of amphiphilic molecule
containing one chiral hydrophilic end group.1−4 As a type of special amphiphilic
molecules, bolaamphiphiles with two hydrophilic end groups connected
by hydrophobic linkers, show distinctive aggregation behaviors.5−16 For example, natural bolaamphiphiles with special molecular structures
can form extremely robust membrane, which can help the archaebacteria
survive in highly acidic environments.14 Indeed, phospholipids with one hydrophilic end group and double
hydrophobic alkyl chains are widespread in the life systems, whereas
bolaamphiphiles are only applied by nature under special circumstances.
Considering the very good mobility and flexibility of phospholipid
assemblies, only the life systems have the complex regulatory mechanism,
which can take advantage of these supramolecular architectures well.1,2 Nevertheless, for the fabrication of functional supramolecular assemblies
in laboratory, bolaamphiphiles could be more appropriate building
blocks.11,17−21 The strong noncovalent interactions between bolaamphiphilic
molecules could induce the formation of various nanostructures with
very good controllability and stability.22−25 However, although the self-assembled
nanostructures of bolaamphiphiles have been thoroughly investigated,
the relationships between these diverse nanostructures and some important
applications, such as photocatalysis, were still rarely investigated.

With the growth of research related to new energy and environmental
protection, the photocatalytic systems based on supramolecular assemblies
are attracting increased interests recently.26−33 Theoretically, bolaamphiphiles should be very good building blocks
for the fabrication of functional supramolecular architectures. However,
the only known bolaamphiphilic assembly for photocatalytic applications
was developed by Lee, et al., wherein the bolaamphiphiles containing
odd number alkyl chains can form nanoparticles upon co-assembly with
porphyrins.20 In addition, the mimicking
of photosynthesis systems of these bolaamphiphile–porphyrin
hybrids was investigated.20 On the other
hand, the performance of natural photosynthetic reaction center is
highly depended on its subtle nanostructures.34 Because the self-assembly of bolaamphiphiles can form complex nanostructures,
understanding how morphology changes affect the functions of these
supramolecular architectures could be very useful for improving the
corresponding photocatalytic properties. In this context, the bolaamphiphile
(Bola-F) with medium length and even numbered alkyl chain was synthesized
(Figure 1). Considering
that the phenylalanine dipeptide has significant advantages for making
functional supramolecular assemblies,35−42l-phenylalanine was selected as the hydrophilic head groups
of Bola-F. In addition, the aromatic ring of l-phenylalanine
is expected to improve the solubility of Bola-F in organic solvents,
which may expand the possible application of the bolaamphiphilic systems.

Figure 1 Schematic
illustration shows that the bolaamphiphile containing
even numbered alkyl chain and l-phenylalanine head groups
(Bola-F) self-assemble into twists in methanol, while forming fibers
in methanol/water mixture. The co-assembly of Bola-F with THPP in
methanol forms microtubes. In methanol/water mixture, the nanostructures
of Bola-F/THPP assemblies are mixed fibers and spheres. For the photodegradation
of RhB under visible-light irradiation, microtubes with small amount
of THPP show much better photocatalytic efficiency comparing with
that of fibers/spheres containing large amount of THPP.

The assemblies of Bola-F with tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin
(THPP) were investigated (Figure 1). The results show that the co-assembly with bolaamphiphiles
could help porphyrin form different supramolecular architectures with
subtle distinction. In methanol, Bola-F molecules self-assemble into
microscale twists. While interaction with THPP molecules can change
these microscale twists into microtubes. In contrast, Bola-F aggregate
into fibers with length more than 100 μm in methanol/water mixture.
For Bola-F/THPP co-assembly formed in methanol/water mixture, phase
separation with the formation of both microscale fibers and spheres
were detected (Figure 1). Most interestingly, the photocatalytic properties of these bolaamphiphiles–phorphyrin
co-assemblies were found to be dependent on their supramolecular nanostructures.
For the photo-degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light
irradiation, microtubes show much better photocatalytic efficiency
comparing with that of fibers and spheres mixtures (Figure 1), despite the fact that the
porphyrin content in the microtubes is only 0.22% of that of the fibers/spheres
mixtures. In methanol, it is demonstrated that the self-assembly of
Bola-F can form monolayer lipid membranes (MLM). In addition, the
porphyrins form dispersedly small J-aggregates, which are located
on different Bola-F MLM layers. Including porphyrins aggregates changes
the twists into microtubes. In water/methanol, THPP and Bola-F cannot
form good co-assemblies because of their different solubility. The
phase separation renders the formation of both fibers and spheres,
wherein porphyrins form very huge J-aggregates. These large porphyrin
assemblies have energy transfer between different porphyrin molecules
under the photo-irradiation, as demonstrated by strong fluorescence
quenching. Therefore, although the fibers/spheres mixtures contain
very large amount of porphyrin with strong J-aggregation, they show
poor photocatalytic performance. These results open a new perspective
for the fabrication of functional soft matters based on the assembly
of bolaamphiphilic molecules.

Results and Discussion
Supramolecular Assembly
of Bolaamphiphiles with Porphyrin
Bola-F is the bolaamphiphile
containing medium length, even numbered
alkyl chain, and l-phenylalanine head groups. The self-assembly
was first performed by dissolving Bola-F into the methanol upon heating.
In addition, the gels can be obtained when the 15.0 mM Bola-F methanol
solution was cooled to room temperature. The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) measurements show that Bola-F self-assembled into twists larger
than micrometer scale (Figure 2A). In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Bola-F
assemblies formed in methanol clearly suggests the layered molecular
packing mode with the d-spacing of 1.86 nm (Figure 2B). The molecular
packing mode and noncovalent interactions were further investigated
by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of Bola-F assemblies
formed in methanol (Figure S1A), wherein
the amide I and amide II bands appearing at 1647 and 1537 cm–1, respectively, suggest the hydrogen bonding between the amide groups.
In addition, the stretching vibrations of CH2 (2917 and
2851 cm–1) proved the orderly packing of alkyl chains
(Figure S1A).44−46 These results
indicate that the self-assembly of Bola-F forms MLM depending on the
hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.14,47 Because of the molecular chirality of the head groups, the multilayer
MLM assemblies form twist. Moreover, when same volume of pure water
was added into the methanol solution of Bola-F, white precipitates
could form. SEM measurements show that the Bola-F assemblies formed
in methanol/water mixture are large threads with the diameter of 1–2
μm (Figure 2C).
The XRD pattern of Bola-F assemblies formed in water/methanol show
strong scattering at the low 2θ value, wherein no clear diffraction
peaks corresponding to layered molecular packing of bolaamphiphiles
can be detected (Figure 2D). The two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 19.08° and 21.12°
could be attributed to the π–π interactions between
the phenyl rings of l-phenylalanine. Presumably, because
of the fast assembly procedure with the formation of precipitates,
some of the molecular building blocks cannot be organized well within
the assemblies. No helical nanostructures can be detected from the
assemblies obtained from methanol/water mixture.

Figure 2 SEM images (A,C) and
XRD pattern (B,D) of the assemblies of Bola-F
formed in methanol (A,B) and methanol/water mixture (Vwater/Vmethanol = 1:1) (C,D).

For preparing the Bola-F/porphyrin
co-assemblies, 10 μL of
methanol solution of THPP (1.0 mM) and 500 μL Bola-F (5.0 mM)
were mixed together. When the corresponding methanol solution was
stored at −10 °C for 30 min, green color gels would form.
For the Bola-F/porphyrin co-assemblies in methanol, the stoichiometry
ratio between Bola-F and THPP was kept as 250/1. The SEM images show
that the twists formed by Bola-F have changed into tubular structures
upon interaction with small amount of porphyrin (Figure 3A). The length of these microtubes
can be tens of micrometers with the diameter about several micrometers.
Although the walls of these microtubes are relatively thick, the opening
of these microtubes can still be clearly observed (red circle in Figure 3A). In addition,
the SEM images of dilacerated wall of microtubes suggest that the
formation of tubular structures should be attributed to the rolling
up of multilayer films. Notably, these tubular structures are relatively
stable, which cannot be changed after keeping for a long time.

(E) of Bola-F/THPP assemblies formed in methanol. (D) UV–vis
spectra of THPP chloroform solution (black line) and the Bola-F/THPP
assemblies (red line).

The micrometer level thickness of Bola-F/THPP microtubes
was analyzed
by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images (Figure 3C), which further demonstrates
the multilayer assemblies. However, presumably because of the very
thick of microtube walls, the hollow structures cannot be identified
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. The UV–vis
spectra of the Bola-F/THPP co-assemblies formed in methanol were also
studied (Figure 3D).
Comparing with the UV–vis spectra of THPP in chloroform solution,
the porphyrin Soret band shifts from 419 to 478 nm. The very strong
red shifts suggest that porphyrin molecules form strong J-aggregations
upon the co-assembly with Bola-F.48−51 The diffraction peaks corresponding
to the layered nanostructures of bolaamphiphilic assemblies are remaining
constant in the XRD pattern of Bola-F/THPP supramolecular systems,
even though the d-spacing is slightly decreased to
1.84 nm (Figure 3E).
These results suggest that the MLM formed by Bola-F were not changed
largely upon interaction with porphyrin. Actually, this feature can
be further demonstrated by the FT-IR spectra of Bola-F/THPP co-assemblies,
which is similar to the FT-IR spectra of Bola-F twists (Figure S1B). Moreover, two new diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 10.32° and 11.24° were also detected from
the XRD pattern of Bola-F/THPP co-assemblies. These peaks are presumably
owing to the aggregation of porphyrins but cannot be simply assigned
as the features of some layered nanostructures.

For further
understanding the supramolecular systems in methanol,
the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of bolaamphiphiles and porphyrin
assemblies were measured (Figure 4). In the case of Bola-F methanol solution, the CD
spectra show positive Cotton effect (Figure 4A). However, the corresponding CD signals
changed into negative Cotton effect when Bola-F assembled into twists
(Figure 4A). The chiral
inversion could be dependent on delicate balance between different
noncovalent interactions during the self-assembly.52,53 For Bola-F/THPP microtubes, the CD signals derived from Bola-F assemblies
still show strong negative Cotton effect, whereas only weak negative
Cotton effect can be detected from the Soret band of porphyrin (Figure 4B). These results
further demonstrate that the bolaamphiphiles still form stable assemblies
after inducing porphyrin into the systems. In addition, the porphyrins
aggregates, which could be dispersed on different Bola-F MLM layers,
do not show strong supramolecular chirality induced by the assembly
of bolaamphiphiles.

red line) in methanol. CD spectra of Bola-F/THPP solution (B, black
line) and assemblies (B, red line) in methanol.

Although the co-assembly of Bola-F/THPP in methanol forms
microtubes,
mixing Bola-F and THPP in methanol/water mixture can lead the formation
of both fibers and spheres. For preparing the assemblies in methanol/water
mixture, the typical bolaamphiphile–porphyrin systems can be
obtained as follows: when 100 μL of pure water was slowly added
to 90 μL THPP methanol solution (1.0 mM), a clear solution was
obtained. Then, 10 μL of Bola-F methanol solution (5.0 mM) was
slowly added into the methanol/water mixture, a green turbid suspension
would appear. The systems were allowed to rest for 30 min, and the
precipitates were separated and collected by centrifugation at 5000
rpm for 10 min. For the Bola-F/THPP systems prepared in methanol/water
mixture, the molar ratio between Bola-F and THPP is about 5/9. Thus,
for the same weight of Bola-F/THPP assemblies formed in different
solvents, fiber and sphere mixture contains much more porphyrin molecules
compared with that of the microtubes. Because of the solubility limit
of Bola-F in water, increasing the quantity of Bola-F will induce
the faster precipitation with the formation of more fibrous structures.
It is notable that the self-assembly in methanol is relatively a slow,
thermodynamic control assembly pathway, which forms tubular structures.
In contrast, the aggregation in methanol/water mixture is a fast,
kinetic control pathway and leads the formation of fibers and spheres.54

The SEM images of Bola-F/THPP systems
formed in the methanol/water
mixture show both huge fibrous structures and small nanoparticles
(Figure 5A). The enlarged
the SEM images (Figure 5C) and TEM images (Figure 5D) of the aggregations of nanoparticles disclose the discrete
spherical structures with diameter of ca. 150–300 nm (Figure 5C). The AFM measurement
also demonstrates that the height of typical nanospheres is about
150 nm. The supramolecular aggregations were further investigated
by UV–vis spectral measurements, as shown in Figure 5E. Comparing with the UV–vis
spectra of THPP in chloroform solution, the Soret band of the UV–vis
spectra of THPP porphyrin in methanol/water = 1/1 mixture only show
slight red shifts. However, the UV–vis spectra of Bola-F/THPP
in methanol/water = 1/1 mixture show very strong red shifts of Soret
band, suggesting that the bolaamphiphiles induce the J-aggregation
of porphyrin in methanol/water = 1/1 mixture. The XRD patterns of
Bola-F/THPP systems in methanol/water = 1/1 mixture were also investigated
(Figure 5F), wherein
no clear diffraction peaks showing MLM assembly of bolaamphiphiles
can be detected. Two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 10.12° and
20.68° could be attributed to the aggregation of porphyrin as
well as the π–π interactions, respectively. The
FT-IR spectra of fibers/spheres mixtures show strong characteristic
peaks of porphyrin, demonstrate that very large amount of porphyrin
molecules have been included into Bola-F/THPP assemblies. These results
suggest that the aggregation of Bola-F/THPP in methanol/water = 1/1
mixture forms phase separation. Although molecular-level mixing cannot
be totally ruled out, most of the porphyrin molecules might aggregate
into nanoparticles in methanol/water = 1/1 mixture.

Photocatalytic Properties of Bolaamphiphiles–Porphyrin
Coassemblies
The porphyrin containing four hydroxyl groups
(THPP) can form different co-assemblies with bolaamphiphiles. In addition,
the nanostructures and properties of these supramolecular systems
can be modulated simply by changing the solvents. Thus, taking advantage
of the characteristics of bolaamphiphilic assembly, the aggregations
of porphyrin photosensitizers with delicate difference of molecular
packing modes can be achieved. Interestingly, although THPP forms
similar J-aggregations, the small porphyrin assemblies within Bola-F
microtubes show much better photocatalytic performance comparing with
that of the huge porphyrin J-aggregations.

The photocatalytic
performance of different Bola-F/THPP systems were investigated in
terms of photodegradation of RhB under visible light irradiation.55 By measuring the real-time UV–vis absorption
spectra of RhB at 554 nm, the effects of photo-degradation were evaluated.
As shown in Figures 6 and S2, for the systems without THPP
(blank), the absorption of RhB show negligible changes upon photo-irradiation.
These results suggest that the photodegradation of RhB cannot be self-sensitized.
In addition, Bola-F itself also cannot catalyze the photodegradation
of RhB molecules. However, when Bola-F/THPP supramolecular assemblies
were added into the photocatalytic systems, the degradation of RhB
could be clearly observed (Figures 6 and S2). These results
suggest that the bolaamphiphile–porphyrin assemblies can catalyze
the photodegradation of RhB molecules. Notably, more than 90% RhB
molecules have been photodegraded catalyzed by Bola-F/THPP microtubes
within 5 h. In contrast, only about 60% RhB molecules were photodegraded
when fibers/nanospheres were introduced in the reaction (Figure 6A). In addition,
the results are consistent for the same experiments repeated five
times.

Figure 6 Photo-degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation illustrates
the photocatalytic performances of different Bola-F/THPP systems (A),
which were also analyzed by the first-order kinetic linear relation
curves (B) and the corresponding histograms of the reaction rate constants
(C) of diverse bolaamphiphile–porphyrin catalysts. The blank
experiment is also presented for comparison in which no porphyrin
is involved.

The photocatalytic performance
curve diagram between ln(C/C0) and the real-reaction
time (T) suggests that photodegradation of RhB molecules
catalyzed by Bola-F/THPP supramolecular assemblies follows the first-order
kinetics (Figure 6B).
In addition, the rate constant of the photodegradation reaction catalyzed
by fibers/nanospheres is calculated as about 1.90 × 10–1 h–1. In contrast, in the case of the reactions
based on Bola-F/THPP microtubes, the rate constant is about 3.49 ×
10–1 h–1.

These results
indicate that the Bola-F/THPP microtubes perform
better photocatalytic activity than fibers/nanospheres in terms of
photodegradation of RhB molecules. Considering that the porphyrin
content in the fibers/nanospheres systems is 450 times higher than
that of the same weight of the microtubes, as well as porphyrins in
different supramolecular systems form similar J-aggregation, the photocatalytic
performance of different Bola-F/THPP assemblies is not simply dependent
on their morphologies. The subtle molecular packing mode should be
evaluated.

Possible Mechanism for Different Photocatalytic
Performance
As mentioned previously, the co-assembly with
porphyrin in methanol
could change the twists, which are the aggregation of bolaamphiphiles,
into microtubes. In this case, the packing mode of bolaamphiphilic
molecules (Bola-F), which should be the typical MLM, is not changed.
In addition, the porphyrins form J-aggregates, which could be dispersed
on different Bola-F MLM layers. For Bola-F/THPP in methanol/water
mixture forming fibers/spheres, however, the packing mode of Bola-F
cannot show layered nanostructures; while porphyrin also form clear
J-aggregation.

It is known that photodegradation of RhB by photosensitizers
under light irradiation is based on the generation of some reactive
oxygen species, such as superoxide anion radical (O2–•) and hydroxyl radical (•OH).56−58 While singlet oxygen was found to lead limited photodegradation
of RhB in many different systems.56,59 It is worth
mentioning that the generation of superoxide anion radical (O2–•) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) is dependent on the electron transfer as well as the supramolecular
assembly of photosensitizers.56,60−63

For Bola-F/THPP systems, however, even though the morphologies
of Bola-F/THPP aggregations formed in two solvents are totally different,
the porphyrin J-aggregation within all the assemblies are nearly same.
Certainly, the amount of porphyrin molecules in difference supramolecular
assemblies are also worth mentioning. The porphyrin content in the
fibers/nanospheres systems is 450 times higher than that of the same
weight of the microtubes. Most interestingly, the microtubes containing
very small amount of J-aggregated porphyrin molecules show much better
photocatalytic performance than that of fibers/spheres, in which very
large amount of THPP molecules also form strong J-aggregation.

The reasonable explanation about this unexpected result can be
that the very large porphyrin aggregations within fibers/spheres systems
could have serious energy transfer, which inhibits the electron transfer
within porphyrin J-aggregations and further reduces the production
of reactive oxygen species. As shown in Figure 7A, porphyrin J-aggregations supported by
Bola-F MLM layered assemblies could perform good electron transfer
upon photo-irradiation. In contrast, too much closely J-aggregated
porphyrin molecules should induce strong energy transfer.

Figure 7 Schematic illustrations
show porphyrin J-aggregations supported
by Bola-F MLM layered assemblies, which could perform good electron
transfer upon photo-irradiation within Bola-F/THPP microtubes (A).
In the case of porphyrin spheres, too much closely J-aggregated porphyrin
molecules should induce strong energy transfer (B).

This mechanism can be simply proved by fluorescence-quenching
experiment,
as shown in Figure 8. The methanol solution of THPP has strong fluorescence. When Bola-F
was added into the solution, the fluorescence of porphyrin was only
slightly quenched. Even when the concentration of Bola-F was increased
into 4 mM, more than 65% of the fluorescence intensity of porphyrin
can still be kept (Figure 8A). These results demonstrate that the energy transfer between
Bola-F and porphyrins is relatively weak. On the other hand, when
the solvent was changed into methanol/water mixture, the aggregation
of porphyrin molecules leads very strong fluorescence quenching, suggesting
the serious energy transfer within porphyrin aggregations.

the concentration of Bola-F in methanol (A), and forming fibers/spheres

Conclusion
In summary, the co-assembly of l-phenylalanine terminated
bolaamphiphile (Bola-F) with porphyrin (THPP) can form microtubes
in methanol, and forms fibers/spheres in methanol/water mixture. Microtubes
show much better photocatalytic performances comparing with that of
fibers/spheres, even though fibers/spheres have 450 times of same
porphyrin molecular building blocks with similar J-aggregation. These
results demonstrated that the hierarchically assembly of bolaamphiphiles
can play very important roles for the fabrication of novel functional
supramolecular architectures.

Experimental Section
Materials
THPP
was prepared by following the method
previously reported.43 Tetradecanedioic
acid, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDAC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole monohydrate (HOBT) were purchased
from Acros Organics. Ltd. and used without further purification. l-Phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride was purchased from
J&K. Ltd. RhB was obtained from Aladdin Ltd. Other chemicals and
solvents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent C., Ltd. Milli-Q
water (18.2 MΩ cm) was used in all processes.

Synthesis of
Bola-F
Tetradecanedioic acid (0.56 g,
2.17 mmol) and HOBT (0.64 g, 4.77 mmol) were dissolved in 100 mL dimethylformamide
(DMF) under stirring. To this mixture, 0.91 g EDAC (4.77 mmol) dissolved
in 10 mL chloroform was added. The system was then stirred under −5
°C for about 1 h. After that, 1.03 g l-phenylalanine
methyl ester hydrochloride (4.77 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL methanol
and 0.67 mL triethylamine were added. The corresponding mixture was
again stirred at 0 °C for 2 days. And the reaction was checked
by thin-layer chromatography. When the reaction was finished, 1000
mL water was added into the mixture. The crude products can be obtained
as white solid, which was filtered, washed with citric acid solution
(0.1 M), sodium hydrogencarbonate solution (0.1 M), and pure water,
respectively. The resulting products were dried at 30 °C under
vacuum. For changing the esters into corresponding acids, the previously
mentioned dried products were re-dissolved in 100 mL DMF, and then,
50 mL NaOH (0.1 M) aqueous solution was added. The mixture was stirred
upon heating at 90 °C for 4 h. Then, the reaction was quenched
by slowly adding 60 mL 0.1 M HCl, and the products (Bola-F) will precipitate.
The Bola-F was collected by filtration, which was further purified
by washing with the 1/1 mixture of acetone and ice-cold water. And
pure Bola-F can be obtained as a white powder after vacuum drying
(yield, 68.5%).

Instruments
A JASCO UV-550 spectrophotometer was used
for the measurements of UV–vis spectra. 1H NMR spectra
(1H-400 MHz) were recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer.
Elemental analyses were carried out with an Elementary Vario El. IR
spectra were recorded using a Bruker Tensor 37 spectrometer. The TEM
measurements were achieved by using a JEOL TEM-2010 electron microscope
(Japan) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera, operated at
200 kV. SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-6510A scanning electron
microscope at 10 kV. The AFM images were recorded from a Bruker Multimode
8 system with a silicon cantilever by using tapping mode. XRD was
measured on a Rigaku TTRIII X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.54 Å), which was operated at 45 kV, 100
mA. F-4500 FL spectrophotometer and JASCO J-815 CD spectropolarimeter
were used for fluorescence spectral measurements and CD spectral measurements,
respectively. For photodegradation measurements, a 500 W xenon arc
lamp (CEL-LAX-500 W, Beijing Aulighttech Co. Ltd, China) served as
the light source. In addition, the photodegradation experiment was
performed on a photocatalytic reactor which came from Beijing Aulighttech
Co. Ltd, China.

Procedures
For UV–vis, CD
and fluorescence spectral
measurements of the assemblies, quartz cuvettes (light path 0.1 mm)
were used. The sample for TEM imaging was prepared by dropping dispersions
onto a copper-coated grid. For SEM imaging, a drop of freshly prepared
sample was cast onto a silicon slice, and then Au (1–2 nm)
was sputtered onto the grids to prevent charging effects and to improve
the image clarity. The samples for AFM measurements were prepared
by casting assemblies on the mica surface.

For photodegradation
measurements, an aqueous solution of RhB dye (100 mL, 10 mg/L) was
first prepared and stored in the dark for about 24 h. In addition,
10 mg bolaamphiphile–porphyrin assemblies were dispersed in
5 mL of the RhB aqueous solution. The dispersion was kept in the dark
place again and stirred for 30 min to achieve an adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. For checking photodegradation properties, the dispersion
was then irradiated with visible light which passed through a 10 cm
water filter and a 420 nm cutoff filter. The reaction was lasted for
5 h and during this procedure, 0.5 mL of the dispersion was taken
out from the photocatalytic reactor every hour for real-time sampling.
The sample taken out was centrifuged (10 000 rpm, 10 min),
the supernatant was pipetted into a quartz cuvette (1 mm path), and
the variation of the absorption intensity of RhB (554 nm) was measured
by UV–vis spectroscopy. For evaluating the photocatalytic character, C represented the concentration of RhB which was measured
at different time, and C0 was used as
that of RhB before the dark treatment. The rate constant of the photocatalytic
performances, in terms of the correlation between ln(C/C0) and the reaction time t, was deduced by a kinetic linear simulation of the curves of the
photocatalytic performances.
