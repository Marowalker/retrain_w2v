A simple procedure of producing three-dimensional
blisters of graphene
through irradiation of the visible range laser by Raman spectrometer
has been presented. Fabrication of different volumes of the blisters
and their characterization were carried out with Raman spectroscopy
by tuning the irradiation dose. The produced blisters showed a consistency
in altitude and a remarkable change in functionality, adhesion force
map and local contact potential difference as compared to untreated
monolayer graphene and naturally occurred graphene nanobubbles. Nevertheless,
bilayer graphene is unaffected in the applied laser doses. The laser
irradiation led to lattice expansion of carbon atoms and introduced
oxygenic functional groups with the structural disorder. The internal
pressure of the gaseous molecules was evaluated by monitoring the
shape of the graphene blisters and nanobubbles. High-resolution Raman
mapping showed the impact of laser-affected area and the defect density
(nd) is reported as a function of displacement.
Our results reveal ease of applicability of the Raman laser for the
imaging and texturing of graphene pointing toward the possibility
of the desirable and cost-effective laser writing at the submicron
scale by tuning photochemistry of graphene which is pivotal for numerous
applications.

Introduction
The extraordinary properties
of graphene have drawn a great deal
of interest in the field of mechanics,1 electronics,2,3 photonics,4 and virtually all disciplines of science and technology.5−7 The rapid progress in this emerging field resulted in tuning the
extraordinary properties of graphene by altering the shape and dimensions,4,8 substrate interactions,3 and controlled
functionalization.9,10 Inducing controlled and optimized
strain in the graphene is another arising field known as “straintronics”11 to tailor the properties of graphene.5 Bending12 and stretching4,13,14 of graphene through tensile force
or mounting over textured surface15 are
common practices to introduce a localized strain in two-dimensional
(2D) materials. Nonuniform strain induces pseudomagnetic fields as
high as 300 T and opens a bandgap in the electronic band structure.16,17 Biaxial strain in graphene can enhance the electron–phonon
coupling and potentially turn graphene into a superconductor.18

Patterning and texturing of graphene through
a laser (light amplification
by stimulated emission of radiation) is one of the efficient ways
for straining and altering electrical and mechanical properties.19−21 Controlled and refined laser treatment can induce subtle chemical
and structural changes in graphene, which leads to tailoring bandgap,
the lattice expansion, functionalization, and conductive channel formation.
It can be produced by a variety of laser treatments such as continuous
wave,22 nanosecond23−25 and femtosecond
lasers.26 Recently, complex and stable
3D structures of chemical vapor deposition graphene are produced by
tuning the dose of irradiation to achieve desirable electrical and
optical properties.26,27 Nevertheless, it will be more
efficient to produce 3D structure by a simple laboratory instrument
using visible radiation.21

Raman
spectroscopy is considered as a sensitive and non-destructive
laboratory tool for characterizing the chemical, mechanical, and electronic
properties of graphene through vibrating carbon atoms.28−30 Raman spectroscopy is based on the vibrational transition of molecules
occurring in the ground electronic state. The irradiation of the Raman
beam in the visible range of light changes the lattice constant of
the sample leading to variations in phonon frequencies.31 Nevertheless, the choice of laser is one of
the primary concerns that is integrated into the Raman spectrometer
system. Prolong exposure to laser excitation energies of 2.33 eV (532
nm) and 1.87 eV (660 nm) at the focusing area up to few microns can
result in damage or modification in the sample.32 Low-molecular-weight polymers are susceptible to initiate
photochemistry/photophysics-induced morphology long before burning.
The same applies to the adsorbed species in air conditions over catalysis.32,33 Nevertheless, tuned laser energy has been used to improve electrical
properties in conjugated polymers by establishing planar conformations
and higher conjugation length.34 Recently,
a reversible cycle of ClF3-intercalated graphene blister
engine is reported, which is ignited by 532 nm wavelength laser. The
gaseous pressure generated up to 22.9 MPa by ClF3 molecule
under the irradiation expand the graphene into the 3D structure and
return to the original position during shut-off laser, and the system
acts as a sustainable piston.35 Continuous
irradiation of Raman laser of 40 mW up to 2000 s can cause several
stages of mechanical (blister) and chemical changes in the graphene/silica
surface useful to generate a desired pattern.21 Albeit a common laboratory instrument in material science, rare
scientific evidences have been observed for the Raman laser-induced
systematic modification of the graphene sample.

In this study,
Raman lasers (532 and 660 nm) at different power
densities (mJ/μm2) have been irradiated over mechanically
exfoliated graphene on silica. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measures
the maximum surface area affected under laser irradiation. A lower
dose of power density (2.5–3.7 mJ/μm2) has
been used for analysis, whereas higher doses (511–753 mJ/μm2) were used for the modifications. Different regions of single
and bilayer graphene have been targeted in air condition. The 3D graphene
structures produced showed distinguished morphology, adhesion force,
and local surface potentials from untreated graphene crystal. The
generation of 3D blisters is achieved through lattice expansion of
carbon atoms and presence of trapped molecules. In addition, laser-induced
partial oxidation of the graphene blisters has been verified from
Raman spectroscopy. The areas affected by the laser irradiation were
analyzed with Raman mapping as a function of displacement, and the
defect density (nd) was calculated. By
tuning the power density of the laser treatment, desirable patterns
of the altered electrical and mechanical properties are attainable.
Thus, here, Raman spectrometer has been established as a detection
tool which is utile for the modification of graphene.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
and Local Surface Potential of Blisters and Graphene
Nanobubble
Raman lasers have been used for characterization
(thickness, oxidation, strain) and fabrication of graphene 3D structure
by changing the power density. Lower power density (2.55 mJ/μm2) was used for the thickness measurement at the initial stage
(see Figure S1 for details), whereas higher
power densities (511 and 753 mJ/μm2) were implemented
for the fabrication at different volumes. Mechanically exfoliated
graphene was used as the test sample, which comprises single layer
(1LG) and bilayer (2LG) over 300 nm oxide layer of silica on the silicon
substrate, Figure 1a. The conferred region is crucial to investigate the significance
of subsurfaces, i.e., a single layer of graphene beneath 2LG and silica
substrate under 1LG. Under irradiation of power density (511 mJ/μm2), arrays of (12 × 10) of 3D blisters of graphene are
produced on 1LG only, nevertheless, 2LG was unaffected (Figure 1b). It depicts the vital role
of interlayer coupling between the graphene layers in 2LG for distributing
laser-induced heat energy by interlayer sliding. 1LG on silica substrate
is resilient to slide due to higher shear strength36 and less capable of distributing the heat energy. The amorphous
nature and lower thermal conductivity of silica (1 W/(m K))-trapped
heat energy between graphene and silica interface cause further heating
of 1LG with time (10–20 s), which then leads to a short-range
distortion and buckling of the graphene layer.21,37

further the laser-induced 3D structure. (b) AFM topography is showing

(753 mJ/μm2) produced three blisters separated by

generated graphene nanobubbles (referred as “Nb”) near
the edge of the 1LG marked by the black rectangle. (e, f) Three-dimensional
(3D) topography of graphene nanobubble 40 ± 2 nm and laser-induced
blisters of altitude 6 ± 1.5 nm, respectively.

Controlled exposure of irradiation produces consistent
altitude
of graphene blisters of average height 2.5 ± 0.5 nm for power
density 511 mJ/μm2 and up to 6 ± 1.5 nm for
753 mJ/μm2, Figures 1c–f and S2. Higher
altitude (up to 20 nm) is reported in a controlled environment of
argon and nitrogen gas by femtosecond laser.26 Nevertheless, continuous exposure of Raman laser at the high-power
density in air condition at 33% of relative humidity can bring chemical
changes in the graphene that will be discussed in the subsequent sections.

The surface chemistry (i.e., functionalization) of the produced
blisters is different from the naturally ensued graphene nanobubbles
produced during preparation of the sample. The adhesion force map
in Figure 2a distinguishes
chemical structure of the laser-induced graphene blisters from the
1LG basal plain surface, wrinkles, ripples, and the graphene nanobubbles.
The graphene nanobubbles are used as a reference 3D structure, which
are produced by strain in the graphene, the presence of trapped molecules,
and the deposition technique. These structural disorders are difficult
to control during physical deposition of graphene but are useful to
compare chemical and electrical characteristics from the laser-induced
blisters. The adhesion force map illustrates the interaction between
the silicon tip apex, elastic penetration, and the sample when the
tip is moving vertically away from the surface, Figure S3. The adhesion force is linked with the contact area
at the tip–graphene interface and the functional group attached
on the graphene. Graphene nanobubble and the blisters resemble in
adhesion force features, i.e., the adhesion force is higher at the
central region of the structures than its surrounding curvature. It
is due to the higher contact area between the tip apex and the central
region of the blisters and at the graphene bubble. These central regions
temporarily acted as deformed elastic membrane under normal force
applied by tip apex.36 One can study the
variation in adhesion force as a function of the graphene nanobubble
volume. The present work is limited to comparison of properties between
laser-induced and self-grown graphene structures.

for graphene nanobubbles. (a) Adhesion force map (measured by pull-out
force) contrast distinguishes 1LG graphene into graphene nanobubble,
blisters, ripple, and wrinkles. (b) The contact potential difference
(CPD, mV) value of an individual blister showing peculiar local surface
potential with respect to 1LG and the nanobubbles (from panel c) by
introducing a ring around inflated graphene with distinct CPD values.
(c) The CPD map of the graphene nanobubbles varying with their altitude
i.e., gap from the SiO2 substrate. The CPD values is highest
for the basal plain graphene-supported silica. (d) The work function
(eV) measured from the CPD for different regions shows highest value
for 1LG graphene and lowest for the graphene nanobubble of altitude
50 nm. The trend is showing that the substrate gap distance plays
an important role in influencing local surface potential.

Higher resolution (inset Figure 2a) of the adhesion force map of the blister
illustrating
a ring structure. It is in a contrast to the polygonic graphene nanobubble
suggesting localized chemical perturbation in the blister. Local surface
potential produced by KPFM also illustrates a ring structure of the
blistered graphene of distinct contact potential difference (CPD), Figure 2b. Nearly 25–30%
decrease is observed in the CPD values of the blistered central region
compared to the untreated graphene. This resembles the wrinkled structure
of graphene, which shows lower work function due to an increase of
gap between graphene and silica substrates, which prohibits p-doing.27,38 The distinct CPD values between the inner and the outer ring of
the blistered region also suggest oxidation of the graphene.21 Unlike blistered graphene, nanobubble CPD values
are evenly distributed. The CPD values decrease with increasing altitude
of the graphene nanobubble, Figure 2c, consequently the local work function (eV). The trends
of work function (eV) for different regions are given at Figure 2d, which validates
the influence of gap distance of graphene from the silica substrate.
The work function of the 1LG measured as 5.02 eV as the highest and
4.79 eV for the 2LG at 33% of relative humidity are in coherence with
the published findings.39,40 The lowering of work
function for the 2LG can be explained by the screening of the charges
(holes) originated from the SiO2 substrate by underlying
graphene.39 Notably, the CPD values from
the inner region of the ring were used for the work function measurement.
This is in compliance with the CPD values measured for the nanobubble
altitude up to 12 nm. These results decipher the locally tuned surface
energy and electrical property for 1LG.

Impact of Different Laser
Power Density
The fabrication
of blistered graphene can be achieved by controlling three major factors:
(1) carbon-lattice expansion at 1LG,26,41 (2) presence
of trapped molecules between 1LG and hydrophilic silica interface,35 and (3) oxidation of carbon atoms irradiated
in air conditions.27 The expansion of carbon
lattice was monitored by investigation of G and 2D peaks at different
power densities by two different lasers (λ = 532 and 660 nm), Figure 3a,b. There is a broadening
of G and 2D peaks with increasing power density for both lasers indicates
increasing temperature.42 This shows the
introduction of oxygenic functional group in air condition followed
by structural disorder or creation of a localized region of holes
doping by oxygen molecules, a similar situation observed by Liu et
al.10 during thermal perturbation for the
entire sample.

Figure 3 Stretching of graphene during irradiation. (a) Raman spectra
of
1LG for lasers λ = 532 nm and (b) λ = 660 nm at different
power densities are showing broadening of peaks (G and 2D) and a red
shift with increasing power density. (c) The sp2 domain
of the graphene is systematically reduced for higher power density
for both laser sources, as illustrated by decreasing intensity ratio IG/I2D. (d) Red shift
in G and 2D peak positions, the slopes produced by linear fit are Sg = 1.9 and Sr =
1.1 for different laser sources. Inset arrow is showing the direction
of increasing power density. (e) AFM topographic profile of the blisters
at different power densities showing an increase in volume.

The frequencies of G and 2D peaks
strongly depend on the change
in charge density either by electrical, chemical, or thermal treatments
owing to the static effect on bond lengths and nonadiabatic electron–phonon
coupling.31,43 The G band (∼1589) is associated
with doubly generated (iTO and LO) phonon mode (E2g symmetry)
at the Brillouin Zone center, which occurs due to first-order Raman
scattering process in graphene.28 The G
peak frequency is extremely sensitive to eventual changes in the oscillation
strength of electron–phonon interaction near the Fermi level.44 Generally, the phonon frequency of G band does
not change by the energy of incident photon involved in Raman process.45 Nevertheless, prolonged exposure (up to 20 s)
of the lasers might cause chemical and structural changes in graphene
due to heating, which can alter the Raman spectra. Therefore, dispersion
of G peak position with a variable irradiated power density (mJ/μm2) suggests a disorder in the carbon lattice.

The dispersion
rate (ΔGpos/change
in excitation laser) increases with disorder46 with the possible generation of local sp2 and sp3 domains in graphene.47 The excitation
energy (EL) leads to a raised bandgap
(Eg) energy in graphene, which enhances
the Raman scattering signal due to the resonance condition in the
optical absorption.28,47 Several reports demonstrated
the impact of laser for decreasing sp2 C=C bond
and increment of C–C bond.26,27 We observed
a decrease of IG/I2D ratio with higher power density, Figure 3c suggests an alteration in the hybrid state
of sp2 carbon atoms up to 50% at the highest power density
as compared to the unirradiated graphene.

Two-dimensional
(2D) peak position shows upshift for the laser
source 532 nm as compared to 660 nm, Figure 3d. Unlike G frequency, the 2D band originates
from a second-order process, involving two iTO phonons at the Dirac
point (K). The incident photon energy changes the
phonon energy in the Raman process. As the photon energy increases,
phonons farther from K point are required for momentum
conservation, which is responsible for significant dispersion.45,48 There is a softening of phonon modes due to lattice expansion for
both lasers (λ = 532 and 660 nm) with a gradual increase of
irradiation dose. Inset-marked frequencies for 2D- and G peak are
measured at lowest power density from each laser. The slopes (S) measured by the linear fit for each curve are Sg = 1.9 for 532 nm and Sr = 1.1 for 660 nm showing higher biaxial strain49 for the former. Fairly large values of S have been reported experimentally as 2.45,14 2.6313 and for theoretical
prediction as 2.2550 for biaxially strained
graphene over hollow silica substrate in the pressurized conditions.
The expansion of the carbon lattice through Raman laser irradiation
is significantly low as compared with pressurized blistered graphene.
This is further confirmed by measuring the topographic profile of
the blistered graphene at a different dose of the power density, Figure 3e. The maximum height
achieved at highest power density (753 mJ/μm2) is
up to 6 ± 1.5 nm, which is less than pressurized blistered graphene.30,51

Role of Trapped Molecules between Graphene and Silica Interface
Graphene has shown impermeability to most of the gases,52 thus a differential pressure of several MPa
can produce 3D structure.51 The role of
trapped molecules to generate pressure and inflate graphene blister
under laser irradiation was estimated by a geometrical approximation
(Figure S4). The topographical informations
(height (h) and width (w = 2r), where r is its radius) were used to
evaluate internal pressure P of the graphene nanobubbles
and the blisters by assuming hemispherical or cuboidal geometry. In
particular, the force equilibrium imposes Pπr2 = 2πrtσ (hemispherical)
or Pw2 = 4wtσ (cuboidal),
where t is the graphene thickness (t = 0.35 nm) and σ is its normal stress. Noting that σ
= Eε, with ε strain of the graphene and E Young’s modulus of graphene (E around 1 TPa) and that geometrically , we derive 1  The geometry,
stress, strain, and pressure
inside the blisters or nanobubbles are reported in Table 1; the pressure is significantly
lower in graphene blisters with respect to nanobubbles.

The role of the trapped molecules
between 1LG and silica interface
is also evaluated by normally pressing graphene blistered at different
normal forces from 0.250 to 10 nN. A systematic decrease in altitude
of the blister was observed, see Figure S5. We successfully reduced the altitude of the blistered region up
to 0.9 ± 0.15 nm at 10 nN of the normal force but were unable
to regain its original configuration, which was 0.5 nm (measured by
root mean square). The discrepancies in the values indicate the irreversibility
of blistered graphene to regain its preceding conformation by normal
pressing and also indicates the traces of the trapped molecules that
did not escape completely. Separately, we did not observe any evident
elevation of graphene blistered at the edge region due to leakage
of the trapped molecule35 although contrasting
feature in the deformation map and adhesion force map has been
observed indicating chemical perturbations (see Figure S6). Theoretical studies revealed that absence of the
trapped molecule could also lead to the formation of blister up to
1 nm in altitude at a laser wavelength of 93.1 nm, which might be
based only on lattice extension.41

Extreme irradiation of the laser can lead to ablation of graphene
carbon atoms and substrate underneath.53 Xing et al. observed graphene threshold damage limit >300 GW/cm2 of power density,54 nevertheless
disruption in sp2 carbon bond can be initiated at 14–66
mJ/cm2.55 We did not observe
any ablation of graphene and silica substrate in the given range of
power density. Nevertheless, a wide area (diameter up to 1.8 μm)
of distorted graphene is observed by force–distance (F–D) spectroscopy through adhesion
force map Figure 4a.
The distorted area of graphene appeared in the annular fashion of
radii (Rh) and (Ri), for Rh < Ri. The affected area associated with Rh is highly distorted regime as compared to Rl–Rh region, where Rl = 3.3(Rh). The
produced deformation shapes resemble to the proposed model for the
activated D-band scattering in the Raman spectrum of graphene sheet
by the point-like defect.56 The model defines
the generation of the circular area over a graphene of different radii
during ions implantation. The inner area has a higher structural disordered
region than the outer area where the Raman D-band is activated and
lattice structure is preserved. We monitored the introduction of the
point defects toward blistered center by analyzing the Raman spectra
over the blistered region at low power density. A trend of ID/IG ratio is observed,
which has the higher values at the central region of the blister, Figure 4c. The total area
contributing to the D peak scattering is proportional to the number
of point defects, giving rise to ID/IG = A/(Ld)2 where A ≈ 100 nm2 (for the low defect density) and Ld is the size of the crystalline sp2 clusters used to quantify
the density of defects (nD) from the following eq 2(46,56) 2  Using finite values of ID/IG at a fixed wavelength (λL), size of
defect density (nD)
as a function of displacement is reported in Figure 4c. It clearly shows that the defect density
decreases farther from the blistered region. The sizes of the defect
density are in close proximity with simulation results showed for
a height ≈ 1 nm produced by defect density ∼ (109 cm–2).26

the tip apex and the surface. (b) Schematic image of the disordered
region at two different radii Rh and Ri represent inner and outer circles, respectively.

Functionalization of Graphene
The impact of the laser
to alter the local functionalization of 1LG is investigated as a function
of displacement. Graphene blisters at Figure 5a are reinvestigated at a high-resolution
physical AFM imaging (of 512 × 512 pixel ≈ 2 μm
× 1 μm) and Raman mapping (pixel square ≈100 nm
× 100 nm) at a lower dose laser energy for a fixed wavelength.
The higher values of ID/IG are localized at the blistered region as compared to
its surrounding, Figure 5b shows the introduction of Raman active disordered region. The decrease
in the intensity of 2D peak (Figure 5c) and broadening of G peak width (Figure 5d) appeared at the central
region of the blister. The correlation between blister’s topography
and Raman peaks was analyzed through line profile over the Raman mapped
region, Figure 5d,
(e.g., G peak width) and morphology at Figure 5e. The line profile over Raman map is associated
to 20 Raman spectra of D, G, D′, and 2D peaks taken at a separation
of 100 nm, Figure 5f. It illustrates the orderly increment of the D peak intensity at
∼1335 cm–1, D′ peak at ∼1609
cm–1 (high-resolution D′ peak is given at Figure S7). The 3D-topography of the given individual
blister at Figure 5e is strongly linked to the red shift in the G peak up to 20 cm–1 (Figure 5g) and its broadening up to 50.4 cm–1 (Figure 5h). All these factors
suggest a feature of partial oxidation with structural disorder,46,57 which is confirmed by the presence of the carboxylic group in Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra at Figure S8. These findings were also observed by Johansson et al.26 to induce epoxy and hydroxyl groups after irradiation
in air conditions.

Raman laser writing can produce an array of 3D graphene in
different
designs, periodicity, or a complex script. Here, “US”
depicts an acronym for University of Sussex with tuned local CPD potential
and adhesion force map at Figure S9. The
method illustrated here opens new avenues and possibilities in the
graphene-based devices to generate localized pseudomagnetic field,16 sustainable and efficient nanoscale motor35 with different intercalated molecules, localized
functionalization surface of different adhesion forces, and polarities
for biosensing applications,58 bandgap
tailoring,59 nanofluid, and actuator.41 Here, we proposed an effective and simple method
to produce 3D structure of graphene with tuned surface properties.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a procedure of producing the
localized 3D structure
of single-layer graphene by tuning laser dose from Raman spectrometer.
Increase in the dose of power density from 511 to 753 mJ/μm2 surges the volume of the blister. The lattice expansion of
carbon atoms increases the gap between 1LG and silica interface and
deposition of the oxygenic functional group, which alters the photoinduced
chemistry of graphene and is outwardly shown through scanning probe
techniques (AFM and KPFM). The introduction of the functional group
and higher contact area of deformation causes the higher force of
adhesion at the blistered region. The CPD contrast showed the lower
work function at the blistered region due to the prohibition in p-doping
from the silica substrate, which resembles the wrinkle and graphene
nanobubble characteristics. The work function decreases with increasing
gap between graphene and the silica substrate. The internal pressures
in the blisters are significantly lower than the graphene nanobubble.
We did not observe any laser-induced ablation of graphene or any vacancy
in the irradiated region, though the structural disorder was received.
The decrease in intensity (IG/I2D) with increasing power density shows a reduction
in the domain size of the sp2 breathing mode. Phonon softening
observed in high-resolution Raman mapping toward the central part
of the blistered region shows lattice expansion of the carbon atoms.
The defect density measured from ID/IG decreases as it goes away from the laser-affected
region (Rh to Rl), affirmed an annular shape for the distribution of defects. Our
results reveal the effectiveness of the Raman spectrometer for the
modifications and functional analysis of graphene layer.

Materials and
Method
Single and bilayer graphene was produced by mechanical
exfoliation
of graphite (HOPG) and deposited on a silica substrate (300 nm oxide
thickness). Deposited graphene on silica substrate was cleaned in
an ultrasonic bath in the sequence of isopropanol and deionised water
each for 30 min, then heat-treated in vacuum for 3 h at 200 °C.

Raman spectroscopy (spectral resolution 0.3 cm–1) has been carried out at 100× objective lens using two lasers.
Laser (1): 532 nm (type: solid state, model: RL53250) and Laser (2):
660 nm (type solid state, model: RL660C100) at different powers (mW).
The maximum power used from the laser source for 532 nm is 50 mW and
for 660 nm is 100 mW. Variations in the laser powers were carried
through ND filters. The higher power densities of the laser were achieved
by increasing the time duration (10, 15, and 20 s) of the irradiation
while keeping the output power consistent. It should be noted that
there is a loss of 5–10% of the power density during reflection
from in-built mirrors in the Raman spectrometer. The laser irradiation
was repeated over four different single-layer graphene flakes of reproducible
textured amplitudes, which are reported at Figures 1, 5, S5, S6, and S8.

AFM characterization was performed with
a Bruker Dimension Icon,
positioned in an insulated box over an antivibrant stage to minimize
environmental noise and building vibrations. Contact potential difference
(CPD, volts) and mechanical data were measured from advanced operation
mode of PF-KPFM (PeakForce-Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy) and PF-QNM
(PeakForce-Quantitative nanomechanical), respectively. PeakForce is
a Bruker’s proprietary mode, which allows the collection of
both types of information on a single acquisition. Amid the PF-KPFM
operation, the standard PeakForce procedure during the first pass
of each line scanning, with the tip softly (<1 nN) tapping on top
of the sample. In this condition, it gathers topography and mechanical
properties of the sample. In the second pass over the same scanning
line, the cantilever lifted from the surface up to 10 nm distance
to collect CPD data. The proprietary Scanasyst algorithms simplify
engaging and parameters for setting procedures, optimizing in real
time Scan Rate, PeakForce set point and Feedback Gain settings but
was in general turned off during capture once the optimal parameters
were achieved to avoid inconsistency forth the final picture. This
type of characterization has been performed using every time the same
mounted tip to guarantee as much consistency as possible in the Kelvin
Probe data, highly variable, being dependent not only on sample properties
but also on the cantilever used in the measurement. A PFQNE-AL tip
was chosen for these reasons, being the gold standard of Bruker’s
tip for KPFM characterization. It is a soft silicon–nitride
tip with 5 nm nominal tip diameter, 300 ± 100 kHz resonant frequency,
and 0.8 ± 0.2 N/m spring constant, optimized for electrical modes
and with a proprietary reflective coating on the backside. Thermal
Tune calibration was performed before each imaging session to verify
consistency of resonance frequency and stiffness of the cantilever.
The stiffer cantilever has been avoided to minimize the physical damage
to the blister.

High-resolution mechanical information acquired
by PeakForce-QNM
(Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping) for Figure 2a, S3, S5, and S6. This mode works with the same procedure described in the first
pass of the PF-KPFM. A silicon nitride (model: Scanasyst-air tip)
was chosen in these cases, having a nominal ultrasharp tip of 2–3
nm that allows maximum resolution while minimizing contact area, ensuring
better consistency and resolution of mechanical information, in particular
adhesion force map. The resonance frequency and the stiffness of the
cantilever are measured as 70 ± 25 kHz and 0.2–0.8 N/m
(nominal 0.4 N/m), respectively.

The adhesion force measurement
carried out in PF-QNM approach was
operated in a true contact mode at relative humidity (30–35%)
at room temperature, the blisters were bearing a certain contact load
and may have a larger contact deformation.60 Thus, the elastic deformation is performed by modest
pressing (set point <1 nN) over the blistered region. It is a distance
between “jump to contact” and the elastic
penetration. Prominent deformation at the blistered membrane leads
to the higher contact area between the AFM tip-apex and the deformed
region, which is responsible for higher adhesion forces “pull-out”.36

The FT-IR measurements were performed
using PerkinElmer Spotlight
400 FT-IR Microscope System. The system uses dual-mode single point
and mercury cadmium telluride array detector standard with InGaAs
array option for optimized NIR imaging. All  the measurements
were done using the mid-IR (4000–500 cm–1).
