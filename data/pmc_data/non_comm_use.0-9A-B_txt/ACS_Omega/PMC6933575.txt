This study demonstrates the synthesis of
nano-zinc stannate and its application as a novel multifunctional
finishing agent on cotton fabric. Nano-zinc stannate has been synthesized
by the co-precipitation method, and the nanostructures produced have
been characterized to investigate their morphology and microstructure
by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
and X-ray diffraction techniques. The synthesized nano-zinc stannate
has been applied on cotton fabric and the multifunctional efficacies
of the treated fabric, like UV resistance, antibacterial property,
self-cleaning, as well as thermal stability, were analyzed. The as-synthesized
zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric showed excellent efficiency in
self-cleaning, antibacterial property, and flame-resistant action
compared to the annealed nano-zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric.
It was observed that the ultraviolet protection factor of the treated
(annealed zinc stannate-treated) fabric shoot up more than 45 after
treatment, and the same fabric showed more than 90% bacterial resistance
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Concerning
thermal kinetics, the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated fabric
registered a 39% reduction in the peak heat release rate compared
to the untreated cotton fabric, and it also showed catalyzed pyrolysis
action and more amount of char mass (30–40% more compared to
the control cotton) formation at higher temperature. The self-cleaning
efficacy of the treated fabric has been examined against coffee stain
and basic methylene blue dye. The treated fabric exhibited a good
efficiency in cleaning of stain due to the free-radical scavenging
behavior. Finally, it also has been proved that the integration of
these nanostructure did not have any detrimental effect on the important
physical properties (tensile strength, flexibility, and crease resistance)
of the treated fabric.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Textile finishing is the
final step of textile chemical processing
and is in great demand in the recent era as this is the area where
highest value addition to textile substrate takes place. Various demanding
value-added textile materials (with features like antimicrobial, UV-protective,
fire-retardant, softened, crease proof, aroma textile, stiff fabric,
odor proof textile, etc.) have been invented by researchers and launched
into the market for customers. However, in most of the cases, a large
quantity of synthetic chemicals have been explored for getting value-added
property of textiles.1

Slowly at
the dawn of the 21st century, issues like eco-friendly
technology, sustainability, health hazards have grown so much that
all of the consumers are slowly shifting their demands toward products
that meet sustainability norms. Most of the synthetic chemicals explored
in conventional finishing of fabric are slowly being banned due to
their toxic and carcinogenic nature. As far as the conventional value
addition of the textile material is concerned, wrinkle recovery, fire
retardancy, softener finish, water repellency, etc. require a single
synthetic chemical agent for each purpose. Therefore, especially in
the current decade, reducing the process cost, consumption of larger
quantity of chemicals, energy, time, etc. are the biggest challenges
for industries as well as researchers. This leads to the necessity
of the development of multifunctional finishing, which is defined
as treating textile fabrics with two or more finishing agents in a
combined bath and in a single step to impart multiple functional properties
together. Multifunctional finishing therefore results in savings,
in terms of energy, time, and water.2 Multifunctional
finishing also implies using a single agent that can confer multiple
functionalities in a fabric. This process makes the application easy
and energy-efficient in terms of water and power saving. Moreover,
the chemical consumption for different finishing approaches will decrease,
resulting in a sustainable approach. However, the real challenge exists
to develop such a material which would potentially possess the ability
to render multifunctionalities in textile substrate.

Adequate
research with different technical approaches has been
focused on developing such type of multifunctional agents starting
from bio-macromolecules to inorganic metal oxides. Exploration of
the bio-macromolecule-based technology and nanotechnology is the most
popular and emerging research domain in the field of multifunctionality.
Different waste bio-macromolecule-based extracts (banana pseudo-stem
sap, coconut shell extract, pomegranate rind extract, etc.) have recently
been explored by researchers for making natural-dyed, UV-protective,
and fire-resistant textiles.3−8

Moreover, most of the treated fabrics also show antimicrobial
efficacy
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.9,10 However, the extraction process of natural dyes becomes very costly
and time-consuming, high add-on to the fabric, and also application
by mordant makes the process slightly more difficult. Therefore, nanotechnology
uplifted in the research field and nanotechnology is an area of science
that deals with matters having one or more dimension of less than
100 nm, and it is being used in many areas at the recent times, most
likely in information technology, communication, paints, textiles,
medicines, cosmetics, and many others. There has been a recent trend
in the application of nanostructured materials in textile finishing.
Nanotechnology promulgates special properties like antimicrobial,
UV resistance, self-cleaning, nanoencapsulation of moisturizing agents,
deodorizing, water or oil repellency, and many more to textile substrate.11−15

The nontoxicity and the chemical stability of UV blockers
like
TiO2 and ZnO make them preferable over organic blockers.16 Antimicrobial properties are also demonstrated
by imbuing various nanoparticles like nanosilver, ZnO, TiO2, etc. into textile substrates. Nanoparticles of ZnO and TiO2 are very effective in the UV region between 300 and 400 nm,
which is mainly the UV A region and the UV B region. The maximum absorbance
is mainly at 290–320 nm for TiO2 and at 370–385
nm for ZnO.17,18 This is a drawback pertaining
to the commercial UV blockers. TiO2 nanoparticles have
been well explored for UV-resistant and antibacterial finish, but
yet there is no conclusive evidence of it having a fire-retardant
property without any synergistic chemicals added. At the same time,
ZnO has very low chemical stability and TiO2 does not have
a broad absorption range. Silver nanoparticles are also popular in
the market in terms of only antibacterial efficacy. However, the application
of silver nanoparticle is disadvantageous in terms of harming the
environment. Being a heavy metal, the existence of silver in the aquatic
organisms may cause various genetic mutations, and later on, deposition
in human body can also cause various health issues. The silver nanoparticle
has been reported only in the field of antibacterial finishing; it
does not possess any other properties like fire retardancy or UV resistance.
Thus, we need to develop a nanoparticle of a metal oxide kind, which
could provide protection from UV rays around 300–400 nm (i.e.,
it will cover both the UV A and B regions), be nontoxic so that its
deposition on organisms does not cause any detrimental effect to the
ecosystem, and act also a finishing agent that can impart multifunctional
properties like UV protection, fire resistance, antimicrobial, antistatic,
self-cleaning, and others.

Zinc stannate nanostructure is a
comparatively newly explored semiconducting
metal oxide, which is similar to ZnO or TiO2 and with a
band gap ranging from 3.8 to 4.1 eV (depending on the structure of
zinc stannate), whereas ZnO and TiO2 have band gaps of
3.2–3.3 and 3.0–3.22 eV, respectively.18 Higher the band gap, more will be the absorbance of the
UV rays when they will fall on these particles. This makes zinc stannate
to cover a wider range of wavelength during the UV absorbance phenomenon.
It is also known as zinc tin oxide, which has received more attention
due to its good optical characteristics, high electron mobility, high
electrical conductivity, and excellent stability compared to ZnO and
SnO2.19 In addition, zinc stannate
has been reported as a metal oxide which can be used as a fire retardant
as well as an antimicrobial agent. Thus, application of zinc stannate
on textile can be a very novel approach to discover it as a chemical
agent that can endow a broad spectrum of multifinishes such as UV
resistance, antibacterial, as well as fire-retardant behavior to textile
substrates. The application in the nano form reduces the add-on percentage
of the fabric to a large extent than the conventional finishes where
for properties like fire retardancy, it requires at least 20–30%
add-on. Zinc stannate nanostructure has been explored in various fields
like gas sensing anode for lithium batteries, catalyst, fire retardant,
antimicrobial, and most importantly as a dye destructor due to its
photocatalytic effect (in textiles).20−24 However, there is no systematic study on the multifunctional
efficacy of the same on textile substrate. Thus, the prime objective
of this research context is to explore its functional effect to impart
multiple protections of textile substrates against harmful UV rays,
microorganisms, fire, and to make a self-cleaning fabric which can
remove the stain by its own mechanism.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of ZnSnO3 Nanostructures
Nanostructured zinc stannate has been synthesized according to
the technical procedure mentioned in the Materials
and Methodology of this manuscript. Thereafter, nano zinc stannate
has been characterized by advanced technological tools for understanding
its morphology, chemical composition, crystal structure, and particle
size.

2.1.1 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FE-SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analyses
Confirmation of the morphology of the synthesized zinc stannate nanoparticles
is an important parameter, and it has been analyzed by FE-SEM and
TEM images. Higher-magnification images of FE-SEM showed the presence
of cubelike structures. TEM images of same magnification (from different
places of the sample) are represented in Figure 1b,c, which shows a clear view of the cubic-shaped
zinc stannate nanoparticles, and the average dimension as analyzed
from the ImageJ software is approximately 65 nm. The homogeneity of
the shape is quite good as most of the visible images do not have
large variation in the size of the cubes. A similar result has been
found when the samples were annealed and its TEM images were analyzed. Figure 1d,e depicts the similar
shape of the nanostructures, but the average dimension has been found
to be reduced to 33 nm, which is quite possible after annealing. The
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis also supports the formation
of the as-synthesized ZnSnO3 nanostructures by showing
the presence of Zn, Sn, and O as elemental form in the powder obtained
(Figure 1f).

zinc stannate structures. (d, e) TEM images of annealed ZnSnO3 and (f) EDX analysis of the as-synthesized ZnSnO3.

2.1.2 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrum
Analysis
The FTIR analysis of both the samples (as-synthesized
and annealed) revealed a significant change in the spectra of both
the structures, depicted in Figure 2. The earlier structure showed the presence of bending
vibration and stretching vibration modes of the −OH group at
3200 cm–1 in the structure of the as-synthesized
zinc stannate. Thus, the as-synthesized structure can be depicted
as ZnSn(OH)6 due to the presence of these surface OH groups.
However, in case of the annealed one, there is no prominent peak at
this range, which is one of the clear signatures of the dehydration,
which has occurred by annealing. In addition, the bands observed at
778, 850, 1174, and ∼2303 cm–1 due to the
vibration of the M–OH or M–OH–M groups are also
not present in the FTIR curve of the annealed one. The presence of
a broad absorption peak from 530 to 591 cm–1 is
mainly due to M–O–M that is the metal oxide bond of
ZnO and SnO2 or Zn–O–Sn which do exist in
the annealed sample. Thus, FTIR analysis clearly indicates the elimination
of the −OH groups present at the surface of zinc stannate nanostructures
during annealing.25

ZnSnO3”
and “annealed ZnSnO3” nanostructures.

2.1.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized ZnSnO3 nanostructures
is represented in Figure 3. The spectra pattern reveals that the structure of ZnSnO3 has proper peaks, which is matched with the JCPDS (No. 11-0274),
confirming the cubic structure of ZnSnO3.26 No peak from other impurities, such as ZnO, other phases
of ZnSnO3, etc., are detected by XRD analysis, and the
results indicating that the products formed on the Zn substrate are
pure face-centered cubic-ZnSnO3. The XRD pattern showed
many distinct peaks starting from 19.76 and the maximum intensity
being at 22.84. The full width at half-maxima value was calculated
to find the mean crystal size of the material. The Debye–Scherrer
equation has been used to calculate the crystal size, and it has come
around 27.32 nm. The annealed structure reveals that there is a shift
in the maximum intensity of the peak to 33.96, but no match has been
found with any JCPDS data. There is a significant decrease in crystal
size to 2.89 nm. This may be due to the reduction in particle size
due to annealing at high temperature.

and annealed ZnSnO3.

2.2 Characterization of Treated Fabric
The SEM images of the control and the treated fabric are shown in Figure 4. The treated fabric
showed the deposition of synthesized nanostructures on the cotton
substrate. Some of the SEM images represented in Figure 4, showing agglomerated structure,
may be due to a bigger cube size, but the higher-magnification picture
reveals the presence of nanocubes on the surface of the cotton fibrils.

SEM images of untreated cotton fabric sample. (c, d) SEM
images of sample P4 (as-synthesized ZnSnO3-treated
fabric). (e, f) SEM images of sample A4 (annealed ZnSnO3-treated fabric).

The FTIR characterization of the control and treated
fabric is
depicted in Figure 5. Concerning the control cotton fabric, a peak was observed at 3344
cm–1 attributed to the O–H stretching for
intramolecular bonding and another peak was observed at 3286 cm–1 attributed to the O–H stretching for intermolecular
bonding of hydrogen bonds present in the cellulosic structure. The
peaks visible at 2921 and 2847 cm–1 are assigned
to the C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration, respectively.
In the same curve, the peaks observed at 1740 and 1649 cm–1 are mainly due to C=⎔O stretching vibration and the
O–H bending of adsorbed water in cotton structure, respectively.
The peaks observed at 1364 and 1316 cm–1 are the
characteristic peaks for C–H bending in the cotton structure
and for the rocking movement of CH2 group, respectively.

Figure 5 FTIR images
of treated and untreated cotton fabric.

For fabric treated with ZnSn(OH)6, the
bands observed
at 778, 850, 1180, and ∼2303 cm–1 may be
correlated with the presence of M–OH or M–OH–M
groups, i.e., the metal hydroxide bond.27 The concerned FTIR curve also showed the bending vibration modes
of surface −OH groups at 3200 cm–1, which
may be associated with the presence of H-bonding with ZnSn(OH)6 and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose due to a slight shift
of the vibration of −OH. The FTIR curve for the fabric treated
with annealed zinc stannate did not show the presence of M–OH
or M–OH–M groups on the substrate, whereas the intensity
of the M–O–M or the Zn–O–Sn or ZnO or
SnO2 bonds got strengthened, which is visible at 530–591
cm–1.

2.3 UV Absorbance and UV Protection Factor
The UV–visible spectroscopy of zinc stannate nanocubes reveals
that mostly the absorbance range of this material lies between 280
and 310 nm with the maximum peak at 290.5 nm, as observed in Figure 6. The range of coverage
at the maximum absorbance region is quite broad and, at the same time,
this phenomenon is advantageous compared to ZnO and TiO2 as it can cover the region of both UV-A and UV-B. Concerning the
absorbance of annealed zinc stannate, the material did not show any
major change in the nature of the curve, but there is a slight change
in the maximum absorbance value. This may be attributed to the fact
that there is a decrease in nanocubes’ size after annealing,
which has also been supported by the TEM analysis, represented in Figure 1.

Figure 6 UV–visible spectroscopy
of the as-synthesized and annealed
ZnSnO3.

The UV protection factor (UPF) evaluation of the
treated and untreated
cotton fabric had a drastic difference in the results obtained. Details
of the UPF values of the control and the treated fabric are represented
in Table 2 and also
in Figure 7. Data represented
in Table 1 reveal that
there is an improvement of UPF value after incorporation of the zinc
stannate nanocubes irrespective of as-synthesized and annealed form
on the fabric. It is clear that zinc stannate can prevent the UV rays
from coming in direct contact with the fabric which is done by absorption
of the UV rays from the range of UV-A to UV-B approximately 290–400
nm.

The treated fabric samples named A (1–4) are
fabrics treated
with annealed zinc stannate, and those named P (1–4) are fabrics
treated with the as-synthesized zinc stannate. The P1,
P2, P3, and P4 fabrics did not show
a very high UPF value, but among A1, A2, A3, and A4, the highest value of 48.43 UPF has been
achieved. According to the literature, UPF value from 40 to 50 is
excellent for good protection against harmful UV rays.28 The trend of the bar graph shown above is quite
common, which interprets that as the add-on % is increased on the
fabric, there is a drastic improvement of the UPF value.

It
has been proved from the experimental results that there is
an improvement of ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) value after
incorporation of the zinc stannate nanostructures (as-synthesized
and annealed) on the fabric. Indeed, zinc stannate can prevent the
UV rays from coming in direct contact with the fabric, which has been
done by absorption of the UV rays in the range of UV-A to UV-B approximately
290–400 nm. A clear analysis of the data represented in Table 2 revealed that the UPF of the A4 sample has been
increased approximately 7 times of its original value. The main reason
behind the increase in the UPF value compared to the as-synthesized
treated fabric may be due to the difference in cube size (as observed
from TEM analysis; Figure 1). After calcinations, there is a decrease in the size of
the ZnSnO3 nanostructures, from 65 to 33 nm. Thus, it can
be opined that the more number of lower-size cubes present in the
fabric resulted in a higher amount of UV absorption. Like this, in
nano form also, lower cube size results in greater effectiveness due
to higher specific surface area. Another possible reason may be decrease
in surface OH groups, which may have caused some free-radical generation
of oxygen atom, thus increasing the UV transmission through the fabric.

2.4 Antibacterial Activity of the Treated Fabric
The treated fabric showed a significant reduction in bacterial
count from the untreated cotton fabric in the cases of both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively.
Percentage bacterial reduction is represented in Figure 8. Usually, cotton fabric is
prone to bacterial attack because of its cellulosic nature.29 Antibacterial testing results revealed that
the treated samples of both P and A (1–4) showed very high
percentage reduction in bacterial colony count. This high extent of
bacterial resistance proves that zinc stannate nanocubes are capable
of producing active oxygen species by generation of holes due to its
semiconductor nature. This may occur when this material is exposed
to UV light or sunlight. The maximum reduction was showed by sample
P4, which contained the highest add-on %. However, even
a lower extent of add-on is good enough for achieving 90% bacterial
reduction. Thus, the zinc stannate nanostructures have effectiveness
to kill the bacteria and reduce the number of colonies built on the
plate. The plates were checked after 24 h incubation at 37 °C.
The antimicrobial results against E. coli were slightly lower than those against S. aureus, as the former has three layers in cell wall, which sometimes are
difficult to penetrate or attack by even nanostructures. However,
still the results are quite positive to say that zinc stannate acts
as an effective antibacterial agent. The mechanism is mainly related
to the photocatalytic activity of the material where it produces OH•, O2–, and HO2– free radicals which can disrupt the cell membrane
as well as the cell wall of the bacteria which are made of phospholipids.30 Though the testing conditions, according to
the AATCC 100 method, were kept in moist atmosphere and in the dark
conditions for the inoculation of bacteria, the mechanism of antimicrobial
effect is different in that scenario. The antibacterial activity in
dark condition can be explained by the slow release of Zn2+, which comes from a very small dissolution of zinc stannate in the
moist atmosphere only to disrupt the bacterial cell wall.31 The use of this fabric will mainly be a garment,
so for that, the earlier-mentioned mechanism of free-radical formation
will take place when it is exposed to sunlight.

tested against both E. coli and S. aureus bacteria.

2.5 Thermal Properties
2.5.1 Thermogravimetric (TG) Analysis (TGA)
Thermal kinetics of the control and treated fabric have been measured
by TG analysis (with the first derivative) and are represented in Figure 9. Control cotton
fabric showed one sharp peak at around 380 °C, which may be due
to the liberation of flammable gases (levoglucosan, pyroglucosan,
etc.), and it has been assigned as the pyrolysis (depolymerization
of cellulosic chain) temperature of the cellulosic polymer.32−34 In addition, it also shows one peak at around 480 °C, which
may be assigned to the char oxidation from aromatic to the aliphatic
form.34,35 On the contrary, the first derivative of
the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric showed two
major peaks at 300 and 413 °C, which may be corroborated with
the pyrolysis and with the char oxidation phenomena, respectively.
It clearly shows that in the treated cotton fabric, the pyrolysis
phenomenon has been catalyzed by 70–80 °C, and as a result,
the extent of the flammable gas formation also has been reduced. On
the other hand, annealed zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric shows
only one sharp peak at around 340 °C, which is somehow more than
the as-synthesized nano zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric but 40
°C less than the pyrolysis point of the control cotton fabric.
Another observation from the TG curve is that the annealed zinc stannate-treated
cotton sample retains 3–4% of char mass, which is almost equal
to the char mass of the control cotton fabric. However, the as-synthesized
treated cotton fabric showed 30% char mass retention at higher temperature.
This high thermal stability behavior also can be correlated with the
LOI value (26) and the burning rate of the treated fabric. All of
the important data connected with the TG curve are represented in Table 2.

Figure 9 TGA and differential
thermal analysis results of fabric sample
A4 (annealed), P4 (as-synthesized), and control
cotton.

From the overall TG curves, it can be revealed
that the zinc stannate
treatment on the cotton fabric has enhanced the dehydration potential
of cellulose polymer by catalyzing the pyrolysis phenomenon and more
amount of char mass retention. However, the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated
sample is more stable compared to the annealed treated cotton fabric
in terms of the pyrolysis behavior and, more importantly, a significant
amount of char mass is retained at higher temperature.

2.5.2 Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI)
The
LOI tests were performed separately on treated fabric. The control
fabric showed an LOI of 20.83, and the treated fabric A4 and P4 had a greater LOI value than the control one,
25.69 and 26.21, respectively. This means that it will have more oxygen
content than the normal atmosphere for the fabric to burn, thus making
it a flame-resistant textile.

2.5.3 Cone Calorimeter Test: Fire Retardancy
For further technical understanding corroborated with the thermal
kinetics and also for the fortification of the TG results, forced
combustion experiments of the control and the treated fabric have
been performed. A cone calorimeter study of the untreated and the
treated fabric has been carried out to understand the burning behavior
of the samples. It is known that heat flux is directly related to
the temperature of the flaming.33,34 The temperature of
the calorimeter can be adjusted to generate different heat fluxes
like 25, 35, 60, and 75 kW/m2. The samples were tested
at a heat flux level of 35 kW/m2, as in the case of a developing
fire, the heat flux level remains similar. Home furnishing textile
materials have been standardized to be tested in a similar heat flux.36−38 The related data for this test are captured in Table 3. The analysis is depicted in Figure 10. It has been noticed
from the cone calorimeter analysis that the control fabric was prone
to catch fire quickly and the time to ignition (TTI) is around 13.8
s, whereas both the annealed and the as-synthesized fabric showed
high time to ignition values of 61.9 and 28.8 s, respectively. It
implies that zinc stannate present on the surface of the fabric has
decreased the flow of heat, and as a result, the time to ignition
(TTI) value is higher compared to the control fabric. After completion
of the combustion process, the treated fabric showed intense white-colored
ash material, whereas the control cotton fabric showed light gray
color, netlike fragile char mass after combustion. It has been observed
from the experimental values that the peak heat release rate (PHRR)
of the treated (A4 and P4) fabric is reduced
30 and 45% compared to the control fabric, which may be due to the
heat absorption by the insulating coating of nano zinc stannate. Likewise,
the peak heat release rate and total heat release (THR) of the treated
fabric were also found to be lowered and much lower (THR: 0.22) in
the case of the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric
compared to the control cotton fabric (THR: 0.35). The concerned curves
of the control and treated fabric are represented in Figure 10. The calorimetric analysis
also determines the maximum average rate of heat emission (MARHE),
which signifies the average energy value produced in a single combustion
period. The maximum average rate of heat emission (MARHE) exhibited
an almost 30% reduction in the case of the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated
cotton fabric compared to the control cotton fabric, as depicted in Figure 10. In summary, it
can be concluded that the as-synthesized zinc stannate treatment has
reduced heat release from the treated fabric during combustion. The
high thermal stability of the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated
cotton fabric has also been reaffirmed by thermogravimetric analysis,
which shows more mass retention of the same fabric at higher temperature
compared to the control cotton fabric.

It has been observed from TG analysis that the zinc
stannate treatment
catalyzes the pyrolysis phenomenon and also assists to enhance the
char formation. Thermal stability of the treated fabric also has been
reflected by the LOI value (25 and 26) of the treated fabric. Moreover,
forced combustion behavior reveals that the treated fabric shows lower
heat release compared to the control cotton fabric. In fact, cubes
of nano zinc stannate deposited on the cotton fabric surface absorb
heat and accelerate the dehydration of cellulosic structure. It means
that the treated fabric has been made nonconductive and fabric has
been made fire resistant by condensed phase mechanism of fire resistant
action. It also may be the fact that the concern zinc stannate treatment
can form intumescent coating on the fabric surface, which resists
the heat flow through the fabric. From both the TG analysis and forced
combustion behavior, it has been confirmed that the as-synthesized
zinc stannate-treated cotton fabric shows more thermal stability (in
terms of char, pyrolysis action, heat release, rate of heat emission,
etc.) compared to the annealed treated fabric. This phenomenon may
be due to the fact that the surface energy of the annealed fabric
is lower and also the nanocubes presented here are in the dehydrated
form compared to the as-synthesized fabric. As a result, heat can
easily get flow through the cotton fabric from one molecule to the
next molecule of the fiber structure without obstacles, and as a result,
it shows lower thermal effectivity compared to the as-synthesized
treated cotton fabric.

2.6 Self-Cleaning Efficiency
Self-cleaning
is a phenomenon very common in most of the inorganic metal oxides.
This is probable when the electrons present in the valance band of
the material jumps to the conduction band only after exposure to UV
rays and in turn releases CO2 and H2O with the
formation of singlet oxygen which degrades the stain or dye that is
attached on the treated fabric. The treated samples were tested for
its self-cleaning effect by adding a small drop of coffee stain on
the treated fabric and control cotton fabric, and then the samples
were irradiated with UV light of intensity 1 W/m2 in a
closed chamber. The irradiation time was varied from 0, 8, and 20
h. It has been observed that as the irradiation time was increased,
the coffee stain in the treated fabric vanished, whereas after 20
h, the stain is still visible in the control (a) sample, represented
in Figure 11. The
wavelength of the UV lamp lied between 300 and 350 nm. The self-cleaning
effect of zinc stannate nanocubes also could be established by the
dye degradation phenomenon.39

Figure 11 Coffee stain
degradation on (a) untreated sample C and (b) treated
sample P4.

Both the P4 and C fabrics were dyed
with methylene blue
(commonly marketed as cationic dye) dye. The samples were exposed
to daylight for 6, 12, and 24 h. The K/S values were calculated both
for the control and preexposure and postexposure samples and are represented
in Figure 12. There
is a significant decrease in the K/S value for the P4 sample,
whereas in the control sample, the value is almost constant. The percentage
reduction in the K/S value is 83%. The tests for self-cleaning were
only done on the as-synthesized zinc stannate-treated fabric. The
presence of surface OH groups enhances the photocatalytic activity
of the material by promoting the formation of OH•, which acts as an oxidizing agent and promotes degradation of the
dyes or stains (organic molecules) that are available on the surface.40

Figure 12 Decrease in K/S of dyed fabric with methylene blue of
untreated
sample C and treated sample P4.

A detailed probable mechanism that lies behind
the gradual scavenging
mechanism of methylene blue dye by free radical is represented in Figure 13. From Figure 13, it has been observed
that methylene blue is made by cumulating three benzene rings containing
alternating double bond and single bond. Indeed, this structure acts
as a chromophore for this dye. When light energy falls on the zinc
stannate-treated cotton fabric surface, it generates free-radical
OH• by the photocatalytic activity of zinc stannate.
This free radical acts as an oxidizing agent and initially fragmented
the collating benzene ring of the dye stain. The OH• free radical also reacts with the highly reactive sulfur group of
the benzene ring of the dye by pie bond breakage mechanism and forms
sulfonic acid (−SO3H) in the further process of
degradation. Finally, after further degradation, only the hydroxyl
(−OH) group has been observed outside the benzene ring, and
in due course, it has been transferred to acid, water, and carbon
dioxide. At the end of the radical scavenging process, dye destruction
has occurred and the treated fabric looks cleaner like it was before
the application of dye on it.41

of methylene blue degradation by ZnSnO3.

2.7 Physical Properties of Treated Fabric
The physical properties of the treated fabric (Table 4) were evaluated, in which the tensile strength
retention was reported as 90–95% in the case of both warp and
weft directions of the annealed treated fabric. The crease recovery
angle (CRA) of the treated fabric showed almost no change in the angle;
thus, there is no significant effect on the dimensional stability
of the treated fabric. Also, there is a slight increase in bending
length in both weft and warp directions, which may be due to the finishing
treatment, which makes the fabric somewhat stiff when particles enter
within the fiber structure.

3 Conclusions
The synthesis method for
zinc stannate has been optimized and a
proper nanocube-like structure has been achieved with conclusive evidence
by various characterization techniques. The crystal structure obtained
has been found to be perovskite. The structural and morphological
analysis of the annealed form of zinc stannate has also been elucidated
in a systematic way. In addition of the synthesis details, in the
present research work, zinc stannate has been demonstrated as a promising
new class of nanomaterials to impart multifunctional properties to
the textile substrates. The maximum UPF achieved on a cotton fabric
was around 48, which is good enough to protect textiles against harmful
UV rays. The UPF was high for the annealed zinc stannate-treated fabric,
the main reason being very small cube size and the structure was free
from −OH groups. On the contrary, the as-synthesized zinc stannate
(before annealing) rendered very promising results for other properties
like self-cleaning, antibacterial, as well as thermal stability. The
mechanisms of various functional properties of the nanostructures
on textile substrates also have been established. However, finishing
durability against washing is a big challenge in the field of nanotechnology,
which needs to be addressed separately in a subsequent study. But
obviously the developed functional fabrics could easily find their
usages in various home textile-based products where washing is not
very frequent. Such applications are always faced with various challenges
while processing as we know all nanoformation techniques have not
been yet fully scalable in terms of commercialization. The feasibility
of the manufacturing process focused in this research work gives it
an added advantage compared to other processes so that this method
can be easily taken forward for industrial trials.

4 Materials and Methodology
4.1 Materials
100% Cotton fabric of 100
g/m2 with 60 ends per inch and 50 picks per inch has been
used for the application of multifunctional finish. Zinc acetate dihydrate
[Zn(CH3COO)2] and potassium stannate (K2SnO3) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich Pvt. Ltd.,
Bengaluru, India. Deionized water has been used for the synthesis
of zinc stannate nanostructures.

4.1.1 Synthesis of Zinc Stannate Nanostructure
In a typical experiment to manufacture zinc stannate nanostructures,
2.1949 g of zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O] salt (10 mmol) was added to 100 mL of deionized water and
the solution was stirred completely until it got dissolved. Another
10 mmol solution of potassium stannate trihydrate was made by dissolving
2.9894 g of K2SnO3·3H2O in 100
mL deionized water. This solution (100 mL) was added to the previously
made zinc acetate solution keeping the molar ratio 1:1. Then, the
solution was stirred vigorously in a magnetic stirrer and kept for
7 h. The temperature maintained was 40 °C in the reaction medium.
After the reaction, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation
and washed with deionized water several times to remove residual ions
in the products. The final products were then dried in an oven at
80 °C for 2–3 h before characterization. This material
collected is the as-synthesized zinc stannate. The synthesized zinc
stannate was further calcinated at 600 °C for 3 h before application
of both as-synthesized and calcinated one on textile substrate.

4.2 Integration of Synthesized ZnSnO3 Nanostructure on Cotton Fabric
First, 5 and 10% (w/v) concentrations
of zinc stannate nanostructures were prepared by ultrasonication at
60 °C. The fabric was dipped in it for 5 min and then padded.
Padding mangle (RBE Engineering Pvt. Ltd., India) at a nip pressure
of 0.2 kg/mm2 and wet expression was kept at 95%. Then,
the treated fabric was dried at 100 °C for 10 min for complete
moisture removal.

4.2.1 Calculation of Add-on %
The fabric
was dried completely and weighed after treatment in a weighing balance,
and the untreated fabric was previously dried and weighed. The difference
between the weight was calculated with respect to the original weight
and multiplied by hundred to get the add-on percentage 1  where W1 and W2 are the oven-dried weights of the control
and treated samples, respectively. The reported results are an average
of five readings.

The add-on % obtained (as mentioned in Table 5) after the treatment
on the fabric are 2, 5, 7, and 10%, and they were conditioned according
to the testing conditions before the treated fabric were tested for
the properties mentioned.

The treated fabrics were coded by the name A (1–4)
for the
annealed zinc stannate-treated fabric and P (1–4) for as-synthesized
zinc stannate.

4.3 Characterization of Zinc Stannate Nanostructures
4.3.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and EDX
Analyses
ZEISS scanning electron microscope (model: SEM Evo
50) was used to observe the morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles
and also their distribution on fabric surface. This was also used
to calculate the dimensions of the nanoparticles that are present.
EDX analysis of the samples was carried out in a TM3000 table top
microscope (Hitachi, Swift ED3000). EDX analysis was also done as
a confirmatory test for the elemental analysis and the atomic weight
content of the elements of the manufactured nanostructures.

4.3.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM was done to view the synthesized ZnSnO3 nanostructures
at a higher magnification level than SEM as the particle size was
lower than 100 nm. JEOL JEM 1400 instrument with an acceleration voltage
of 120 kV was used to record the images. In addition to it, selected
area electron diffraction diagram was analyzed from the images received.

4.3.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD (PANalytical
odel: X’Pert PRO) was done to analyze the structure of the
formed ZnSnO3 crystals. As zinc stannate has two different
structures, this structural confirmation is very important, as structural
properties can change the application properties of the material.
The X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å as the source with 30 kV capacity was used for this
analysis.

4.3.4 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR was used mostly for identifying chemicals that are either
organic or inorganic. The infrared absorption spectrum was used to
identify the chemical bonds present in zinc stannate nanostructures.
FTIR analysis has been performed by using PerkinElmer Spectrum BXFT-IR
system. The range of wavelength measured was 450–4000 nm. The
data were measured in transmission mode.

4.4 Characterization of Treated Fabric and Its
Multifunctional Properties
4.4.1 UV Absorbance and UPF
The evaluation
of UV protection given by the fabric was done according to the AATCC
test method 183 (AATCC 2005). It measures the transmittance or blocking
of erythemal weighted UV radiation through fabrics by the use of an
instrument called UV–visible spectrophotometer. A single wavelength
beam is directed in the UV light (which is of measured quantity and
perpendicular to the surface of the fabric sample) to measure the
amount of radiation transmitted through the fabric. All wavelengths
of the UV range are directed toward the sample, and the transmittance
data are collected 2  where Eλ is the relative
erythemal spectral effectiveness, Sλ is the
solar spectral irradiance, Δλ is the
measured wavelength interval (nm), and Tλ is
the average spectral transmittance of the specimen.

4.4.2 Antibacterial Testing
To investigate
the antibacterial activity of the fabric samples treated with ZnSnO3 nanostructures, quantitative assessment method, AATCC 100-2004
was used. The test was carried out against Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. The percentage reduction of bacteria by the cotton fabric
treated and untreated is denoted as R 3  where “R” is
the percentage reduction, “A” is the
number of bacteria colonies formed on the control sample, and “B” is the number of bacteria colonies formed on the
treated sample.

4.4.3 Dye Degradation
The control cotton
fabric and ZnSnO3-treated fabric were dipped in a methylene
blue dye solution (1% on the weight of the fabric) for 15 min for
proper staining. The samples were dried and conditioned after that
and were exposed to daylight irradiation for 12 h. The color strength
of the fabric was measured before and after the irradiation, which
is the K/S value. This is also known as the color strength, which
is expressed as the ratio of absorption and scattering coefficient 4  where R is the reflectance
value of the methylene blue dye at its maximum absorbance.

4.4.4 Assessment of Degradation of Coffee Stain
A coffee solution was prepared in water to replicate the situation
of a stain. The treated fabric was cut into 6.5 × 4.5 cm2, and one drop of stain was spread on the treated fabric.
All of the samples were irradiated with a UV lamp of the 354 nm in
a weather meter with an intensity of 1 W/m2. The fabrics
were checked after 0, 8, and 20 h and compared using the image analysis.

4.4.5 Physical Properties Testing of Fabric
The physical properties of the control and the treated fabric were
measured in terms of tensile strength (ASTM D 5035:2006) and crease
recovery angle (AATCC 66:2008). Conditioning of the samples was done
keeping the fabric samples at a relative humidity (RH) of 65% and
a temperature 26 ± 2 °C for 24 h, and then the fabrics were
tested for their physical properties.

4.4.6 Thermal Properties
4.4.6.1 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
The TGA of the fabrics was done by thermoravimetric analyzer (METTLER
TOLEDO TG-50/MT5). The tests were executed in air atmosphere at 2
mL/min at a heating rate of 20 °C/min and ranging from 50 to
700 °C. This test helps to develop knowledge about the degradation
of weight with varying temperature and time.

4.4.6.2 Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI)
LOI
test was performed on control and all treated samples. LOI values
of the fabrics were determined by the amount of O2 and
N2 present in the chamber to ignite the clamped material.
The following equation was used to calculate this value 5  

4.4.6.3 Cone Calorimeter Analysis
A sample
specimen of “100 × 100” mm2 control
and the zinc stannate-treated cotton textile were tested according
to procedure of ASTM standard: ISO 5660. The specimens were kept horizontally
under the cone with a heat flux value of 35 kW/m2. Conditioned
samples (65% RH and 27 °C) were ignited to record the data according
to ISO 5660-1. Machine was calibrated by methane gas and the spark
igniter was used above the sample according to standard test method.
