Solution-based
indium–gallium–zinc oxide (IGZO) nanoparticles
deposited by spin coating have been investigated as a resistive switching
layer in metal–insulator–metal structures for nonvolatile
memory applications. Optimized devices show a bipolar resistive switching
behavior, low programming voltages of ±1 V, on/off ratios higher
than 10, high endurance, and a retention time of up to 104 s. The better performing devices were achieved with annealing temperatures
of 200 °C and using asymmetric electrode materials of titanium
and silver. The physics behind the improved switching properties of
the devices is discussed in terms of the oxygen deficiency of IGZO.
Temperature analysis of the conductance states revealed a nonmetallic
filamentary conduction. The presented devices are potential candidates
for the integration of memory functionality into low-cost System-on-Panel
technology.

1 Introduction
There
are fundamental limits to the downscaling of materials involved
in the current complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies.
Resistive random-access memories (RRAMs) can be considered as a highlight
as they consist of two terminal devices with metal–insulator–metal
(MIM) structure, allowing large-scale-integration circuits.1

They can be described, in simplified form,
as a nonlinear passive
resistor (memristor). RRAMs combine the best features of current memories
such as the fast speed of SRAM, high density of DRAM, and nonvolatile
properties of flash memory. These advantages support the idea that
the future of memory technology will be based on RRAM devices.2−5 This memory technology will revolutionize all consumer electronic
products from computing technology to healthcare and the Internet
of Things.

An ideal System-on-Panel (SoP) technology utilizes
electronic circuits,
which are deposited with the same tools and materials as those used
for the display components. This explains the choice to investigate
amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) for RRAMs,
because it can be commercially applied in the thin-film transistors
(TFTs) of driver circuits for active-matrix displays.6,7 The highly competitive markets for such displays, as mentioned above,
demand the lowest production cost possible, which motivates a solution-based
deposition route. Here, the main bottleneck is to find the optimal
compromise between electrical performance/reliability and production
cost effectiveness.

Developments in IGZO-based RRAM have been
reported elsewhere, focusing
on studies of bipolar behavior in fully transparent devices,8,9 unipolar switching behavior,10 electrode
influence,11 filament nature,12 and flexible devices.13 A single synaptic device based on an a-IGZO memristor has been reported,14 demonstrating the versatility of these devices.
The most common industrially relevant deposition technique for IGZO
films is radio frequency magnetron sputtering, and several ways to
improve the performance of the corresponding memory devices have been
reported. An interlayer of Ti at the interface improves the device
yield and resistive switching properties due to the formation of TiOx.15 Microwave irradiation
can be used to obtain a smoother surface, which results in more stable
resistive switching properties.16 By engineering
the concentration of oxygen vacancy defects, stable forming-free resistive
switching characteristics are obtained.17 SiO2 has been used as a series resistance material to
produce a thinner conductive filament.18 These reports show the excellent resistive memory properties that
can be obtained with sputter-deposited IGZO. This justifies the investigation
of low-cost fabrication routes such as deposition from solution, because
such methods typically lead to more defective materials with poorer
electrical properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, only
two reports on solution-based IGZO nonvolatile memories exist so far:
Inspired by low-cost IGZO solution-based TFTs, Kim et al.19 developed a-IGZO solution-based bipolar RRAM.
However, the devices operate at high current level and the reported
on/off ratio did not exceed 1 order of magnitude. Later, Hu et al.20 reported an a-IGZO-based RRAM device fabricated
by a photochemical solution deposition with improved unipolar memory
performance.

This work intends to further explore the potential
of solution-based
synthesis of oxide-based RRAM. The here presented method comprises
the synthesis of nanoparticles followed by thin-film deposition from
a dispersion. An important reason to choose such a dual-stage process
is the greater production flexibility compared to that of direct deposition
from solution. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report
on a RRAM device based on IGZO nanoparticles. Furthermore, a maximum
process temperature as low as 200 °C is introduced because this
enables the integration on flexible substrates.

2 Results
and Discussion
IGZO nanoparticles (IGZOnp) used as the memristive
switching layer
were produced by hydrothermal synthesis. The film was deposited on
substrates using a common Ti bottom contact. The annealing temperature
of 350 °C was optimized by Santos et al.21 and applied to two substrates, the remaining two substrates were
annealed at 200 °C for comparison.

For each annealing temperature,
two types of MIM structures were
fabricated. One structure is symmetric using Ti top electrodes (Ti/IGZOnp/Ti).
The other structure is asymmetric by applying Ag as top contact (Ag/IGZOnp/Ti).

Figure 1 depicts
a typical substrate with the 6 by 6 matrix of MIM structures used
in this study. A cross-section view of the device by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) in Figure 1b shows the 20 nm thick IGZO nanoparticle layer. Furthermore, Figure 1c,d shows the surface
morphology characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the IGZOnp
thin-film deposited on Ti on Corning glass. A smaller nanoparticle
size is observed for the lower temperature. For 200 °C, the mean
particle radius was approximately 3 nm whereas for 350 °C, it
was ∼4 nm. It was also observed that for lower temperatures,
there is a decrease of surface roughness.

As is often reported for resistive switching systems, the
MIM structures
undergo an irreversible electroforming process before they can act
as a memory device.22 The original conduction
state is referred to as the pristine state.

Figure 2 compares
the current–voltage characteristic (I–V) of a typical pristine state as well as off-state and on-state I–V curves of all four devices. In the pristine state,
samples annealed at 350 °C show higher conductance than that
of the ones annealed at 200 °C. When Ti is used for both electrodes,
the I–V curve is symmetric for both polarities.
In contrast, MIM structures using Ag as top contact electrode and
Ti as bottom contact show a rectifying behavior in the pristine state.

Figure 2 Typical I–V characteristics showing the
forming process and memory states. (a, b) Ti/IGZOnp/Ti annealed at
350 and 200 °C, respectively. (c, d) Ag/IGZOnp/Ti annealed at
350 and 200 °C, respectively.

To electroform the memory cell, particular care has to be
taken
to prevent the immediate breakdown, thus current compliance (CC) is
required. For the Ti/IGZOnp/Ti devices, the forming step occurs by
a positive voltage applied to the top electrode. However, it should
be noted that structures with the same type of metal electrode (Ti)
at both contacts do not have a preferential voltage polarity to electroform,
thus applying positive or negative voltages led to identical resistive
switching behavior.

For the MIM structure using the silver top
electrode, electroforming
occurs only when a negative bias is applied to the silver contact.
Forming under positive bias leads to unstable switching behavior after
a few programming cycles. Furthermore, electroforming is established
at lower voltages compared to that for the symmetric MIM structures
using Ti on both top and bottom electrodes. Finally, the low conductance
state (off-state) has a higher conductance than the pristine state.

Cycles of endurance and retention tests were carried out for all
four devices to evaluate the impact of different electrodes and annealing
temperature on memory performance. Reading voltages were ±0.1
V, corresponding to set polarization. Figure 3 shows endurance tests over 100 cycles in
sweep voltage mode carried out for all four test devices. The Ti/IGZOnp/Ti
device annealed at 350 °C shows a set voltage at 1.3 V in the
first cycle, with a tendency to shift to higher voltages as the number
of cycles increases. Noncontrollable intermediate switching events
to off-state appear during the endurance cycles under the reset process
between −0.8 and −1.5 V (see Figure 3a). For the Ti/IGZOnp/Ti device annealed
at 200 °C, set voltages between 0.8 and 1.3 V and reset voltages
of −1 to −1.5 V are observed (see Figure 3b). Here, the on/off current ratio and the
memory performance gradually deteriorate after the 40th cycle.

annealed at 200 °C, (c) Ag/IGZOnp/Ti annealed at 350 °C,
and (d) Ag/IGZOnp/Ti annealed at 200 °C.

Figure 3c,d
shows
endurance cycle tests carried out on Ag/IGZOnp/Ti devices annealed
at 350 and 200 °C, respectively. The hysteresis shows a clockwise
direction that is consistent with the negative bias forming loop.
For the first device annealed at 350 °C, the set process is performed
at −1.4 V and reset occurs at 2 V. For the device annealed
at 200 °C, the set voltage is even lower, between −1 and
−0.8 V, and the reset is obtained by applying a positive voltage
of 1 V. The operating on/off ratio window is more than 1 order of
magnitude.

Concerning the data retention presented in Figure 3, the comparison
of all four devices shows
that all devices except Ti/IGZOnp/Ti fabricated at 200 °C annealing
temperature have a retention time of at least 104 s when
keeping the switching margin equal to or even higher than 10.

Table 1 compares
the main electrical characteristics for both Ti/IGZOnp/Ti and Ag/IGZOnp/Ti
memory devices annealed at different temperatures. The yield was defined
here as the number of devices out of 36 that show at least 10 stable
and consecutive endurance cycles.

Ag/IGZOnp/Ti
devices annealed at 200 °C provide the best memory
performance. According to the data compared in Table 1, the Ag/IGZOnp/Ti structures show the highest
yield (68%), the higher data retention time, and operate at the lowest
switching voltages. Furthermore, they are electroformed at very low
current (10 μA).

It is remarkable that the silver-based
memory devices show a self-compliant
behavior, i.e., set occurs prior to reaching the CC level. This can
be observed when a rather high CC level is chosen, as shown in Figure 3c. Without the need
for an external current compliance, the simpler circuit provides a
unique advantage for high density memory cells in crossbar arrays.
The origin of the self-compliant phenomenon remains elusive, even
if some authors tentatively explain it as caused by the formation
of a thin oxide layer between the switching layer and the contact.18,23

For further understanding of the mechanism behind the reliable
switching event of the Ag/IGZOnp/Ti device, the fitting of typical I–V characteristics in a log–log scale was done (see Figure 4a). The space-charge-limited conduction is observed
at the off-state, including three regions: (i) Ohmic region with an
approximate slope close to 1 from 0 to 0.3 V, (ii) a slope of 2 from
0.3 to 0.7 V, which is in accordance with Child’s square law
(I ∝ V2), and
(iii) a steep increase region for voltages >0.7 V. The on-state
shows
Ohmic behavior, indicating the presence of highly conductive paths.
The results are in agreement with the ones reported for a-IGZO memory
devices.9,20 Similar characteristics are observed for
the Ti/IGZOnp/Ti structure, shown in Figure S2.

Figure 4 (a) I–V characteristics of Ag/IGZOnp/Ti
device plotted in log–log scale, showing a
space-charge-limited conduction mechanism, the numbers represent the
slope. (b) Temperature dependence of the memory conductance states.

Figure 4b shows
the temperature dependence of the on- and off-states in the temperature
range of 220–320 K at the read voltage of −0.1 V for
Ag/IGZOnp/Ti devices annealed at 200 °C. The on-state conductance
shows a weak thermal activation. This temperature dependence rules
out metallic-like conduction and excludes that Ag atoms24 serve as the conducting filaments. Other reports
of IGZO-based resistive memories have shown a metallic-like temperature
dependence of conductance,25−27 in contrast to the data presented
here. This may be related to residual impurities from the solution
processing, more precisely ethylene glycol and ethanol.21 The presence of such impurities could be confirmed
by attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR), see Figure S1. It has been
shown that thermal activation of conductivity in IGZO with a high
carrier concentration is related to the density of states in the vicinity
of the valence band maximum.28,29 The nature of these
states are OH groups, which act as compensating acceptor defects.30,31 As observed by ATR-FTIR in Figure S1,
the residual impurities from the solution processing introduce a considerable
density of these defects in the material, which in turn hinder the
Fermi energy to enter the conduction band and cause the observed nonmetallic
temperature dependence of conductance.

The temperature dependence
for the off-state shows an anomalous
behavior. For the off-state below 270 K, a very large positive temperature
coefficient (PTC) is observed. The increase of the current upon lowering
the temperature of the device is more than 2 orders of magnitude in
a temperature range of 60 K (α = 0.02 K–1).
This PTC is anomalously large when compared with typical values for
metals (α = 4 × 10–3 K–1 for Ag26). This behavior has been observed
on other RRAM devices and explained as due to filamentary conduction.32 For temperatures above 270 K, the temperature
dependence shows a semiconductor-like behavior. The transition point
between the two behaviors occurs close to the temperature of the phase
transition of water (273 K), which is unavoidably present due to the
fabrication process.33

A stochastic
electrical behavior is observed for the symmetric
Ti-based device structure. By replacing the Ti top electrode with
Ag, the memristor shows stable switching properties with higher switching
yield during endurance tests. In the following, the role of the titanium
at the interface to the IGZO shall be discussed. Figure 5 serves as an accompanying
graphical illustration. Titanium is referred to as an oxygen-getter
material due to its high affinity for forming titanium oxide.34 In the devices presented here, this leads to
the removal of oxygen from the IGZO layer. Because this process is
accelerated at higher temperatures, the IGZOnp films annealed at 350
°C are more conductive than the ones annealed at 200 °C.
In Figure 5, this is
represented by the more intense red color toward the titanium bottom
electrode. Although the annealing is done in contact with ambient
air, the electrical conductance of the devices is dominated by the
oxygen removal at the titanium bottom electrode and not by an eventual
oxidation at the IGZOnp film surface. The presence of an anatase phase
could be confirmed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) in
the samples annealed at 350 °C, whereas the same could not be
detected in the samples annealed at 200 °C (see Figure S3). This confirms the increased oxidation of the titanium
bottom electrode when the samples are annealed at the higher temperature.

Figure 5 Schematic
illustration of the pristine state of the different devices:
Ti/IGZO/Ti annealed at (a) 350 °C and (b) 200 °C, and Ag/IGZO/Ti
annealed at (c) 350 °C and (d) 200 °C. The oxygen deficiency
inside the IGZOnp layer is shown qualitatively in red color gradients.

The electron beam deposition of
the titanium top electrode leads
to the formation of a thin layer of oxidized titanium at the interface.35 Hence, a similar—although probably less
severe—oxygen-getter effect occurs at the top contact of the
Ti/IGZOnp/Ti devices, which also leads to an increase of conductivity
close to the top surface of the IGZO layer. In Figure 5, this is shown by the red color below the
titanium top electrodes. When silver is used instead, the conductivity
at the top interface is lower, because silver typically does not oxidize
in contact with IGZO (based on the Gibbs free energies of formation34,36). Moreover, silver is reported to form a Schottky barrier with IGZO,
which implies a high resistivity in the IGZO at this interface.37,38 Therefore, under negative forming bias, a conductive filament based
on oxygen vacancies growing from the bottom contact toward the top
contact results in more stable switching events, as compared to the
titanium top contact. Furthermore, the conductance in the pristine
state under negative bias allows for the use of a lower CC during
electroforming (see Table 1). In this way, the risk of breakdown due to Joule heating
effects is minimized.

3 Conclusions
The
solution-based Ti/IGZOnp/Ti and Ag/IGZOnp/Ti memory devices
were fabricated at different annealing temperatures of 200 and 350
°C. The lowest switching voltages were observed for Ag/IGZOnp/Ti
devices annealed at 200 °C with set and reset voltages of +1
and −1 V, respectively, and retention times of up to 104 s. The Ag/IGZOnp/Ti devices showed higher yields compared
to those of the symmetric Ti-based devices. Temperature-dependent
measurements reveal a nonmetallic conductive filament at the on-state.

It could be shown that the oxygen-getter effect due to the oxidation
of titanium increases the conductivity of IGZO. If both IGZO interfaces
are oxygen deficient, stochastic switching properties are observed.
The solution is a nonsymmetric device architecture using a nonoxidizing
top electrode such as silver. The resulting lower conductivity is
favorable to establish a well-defined filamentary path by applying
lower current compliance during electroforming.

In summary,
we demonstrated an RRAM device processed from a dispersion
of solution-based IGZO nanoparticles. In comparison to the previously
reported works on solution-based IGZO,20 we have achieved lower operation power. Also, self-compliant operation
is a major feature that simplifies the circuit design. This RRAM device
has the potential to be integrated into SoP technology.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Device Fabrication
IGZO nanoparticles
were produced following a recipe previously developed by Santos et
al.21 with gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%),
indium acetate (In(CH3COO)3, Sigma-Aldrich,
99.99%), and zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)3·2H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) precursors with a molar ratio of 3:6:2,
respectively. The mixture was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (6 mL,
Sigma-Aldrich, 99,5%) with ethanolamine (0.2 mL, Fluka, 98%) as a
cation reductor, and the solution was left stirring at 50 °C
for 1 h. The final solution was transferred to the polytetrafluoroethylene
cup of a 23 mL stainless-steel autoclave (4745 general purpose vessel,
Parr), and placed in an oven (L3/11/B170, Nabertherm) at 180 °C
for 24 h. The resulting product was collected by centrifugation at
4000 rpm for 5 min (F140, Focus instruments) and dispersed in ethanol
(20 mL).

IGZOnp ink was ensured by mixing ethylene glycol (Carlo
Erba, 95.5%) with the previous dispersion in a 0.4:1.6 proportion,
respectively, and consequently, the mixture was left stirring for
24 h. Then, it was sonicated for 2 min and filtered with a 0.45 μm
porous diameter filter (Sartorius CA). The deposition process was
performed by spin coating 4 layers at 2000 rpm for 35 s and drying
at 100 °C for 1 min between each layer. The annealing process
was done in air after the fourth deposition at 350 and 200 °C
for 1 h.

MIM structures were fabricated on glass substrates
(1737, Corning).
First, a 60 nm Ti thin-film was deposited by e-beam evaporation (homemade
apparatus) followed by spin coating deposition of the IGZO ink, creating
an IGZOnp thin-film layer of approximately 20 nm, see Figure 1b. The top electrode was deposited
with the same procedure as the bottom electrode but using a shadow
mask, where titanium (60 nm) or silver (60 nm) were deposited on different
substrates. A device area of 19.6 μm2 was defined
by top electrode deposition through a shadow mask.

4.2 Materials and Device Characterization
Structural and
morphological characterization of the IGZO nanoparticles
was performed by scanning electron microscopy (Carl Zeiss AURIGA).
The nanoparticles were deposited on a silicon substrate for the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements and scanned in the 20–70°
2θ range with a step size of 0.033° in a PANalytical’s
X’Pert PRO MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. In
addition, the devices were measured by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
with the same diffractometer at an incident angle of Ω = 1.1°
and a step size of 0.1°. The IGZO thin-film surface roughness
was analyzed by atomic force microscopy in a commercial microscope,
Asylum Research MFP-3D. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transformed
infrared spectroscopy was measured with a Thermo Nicolet 6700 Spectrometer,
using a single bounced diamond crystal (4500–525 cm–1).

IGZOnp memristor electrical characterization was performed
using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200SCS).
Positive bias refers to the top electrode in the sandwich structure.
