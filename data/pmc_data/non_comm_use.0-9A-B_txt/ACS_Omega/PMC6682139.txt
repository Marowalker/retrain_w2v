A label-free electrochemical immunosensor
for cardiac troponin
I was prepared by using a helical carbon nanotube-supported aldehyde-functionalized
ionic liquid. Because of the good conductivity of ionic liquid and
helical carbon nanotubes, high sensitivity of the immunosensor was
obtained. Functionalized ionic liquid provided binding sites for antibody,
which simplified the process of sensor construction. Cardiac troponin
I was detected by this immunosensor with a linear range of 0.05–30
ng/mL and a detection limit of 0.03 ng/mL. The electrochemical immunosensor
had satisfactory reproducibility, high sensitivity, and acceptable
specificity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cardiac troponin I (cTnI),
as a marker protein of myocardial damage,
was recognized as the “gold standard” biomarker test
for acute myocardial infarction.1 Accordingly,
sensitivity and accuracy were very important for cTnI detection. Many
detection strategies had been put forward for the quantitative detection
of cTnI, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay2 and photoelectrochemical immunoassay.3 Recently, fluorescent immunosensor and electrochemiluminescent
immunoassay for cTnI was also reported.4,5 However, these
methods had some drawbacks including the need for a tedious labeling
process, bulky and expensive equipment, and highly skilled operators.
The electrochemical immunosensor had aroused researchers’ interest
because of its high sensitivity, handling, portability, miniaturization,
and low operating cost.6,7 In most previous studies, linear
carbon nanotubes (LCNTs) had widely been applied in the field of electrochemical
immunosensors.8−11 However, only few electrochemical immunosensors based on helical
carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) had been reported to date.12,13 The surface of HCNTs was more susceptible to chemical modification
than that of LCNTs because of the high energy state as a result of
inherent tensile and compressive stresses. In addition, the difference
of charge density caused by the lattice defect of carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) improved the electronical properties.14,15 This motivated us to fabricate an electrochemical immunosensor using
HCNTs for the detection of cTnI.

Because ionic liquids (ILs)
had the advantages such as high ionic
conductivity, chemical stability, and good biocompatibility, they
were widely used in the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors
by being incorporated into other matrixes including graphene, metal
nanoparticles, fullerene, and cellulose.16−20 Because of π–cation interaction between
CNTs and IL, they could closely combine together to form nanocomposites
which provided a platform for the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors.21,22 However, most reported papers focus on LCNTs with ILs without functionalization
and a few based on HCNTs with dialdehyde-functionalized IL (DIL).

Antibody immobilization using a simple method, such as DIL,23 attracted many researchers. In this article,
the DIL–HCNTs (the composite of DIL and HCNTs) was prepared
by the ultrasound method, where DIL noncovalently bonded together
with HCNTs through π–π and π–cation
interactions.13 Subsequently, the DIL–HCNTs
was used to fabricate a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for
cTnI detection. As the conductivity of the sensing interface was enhanced
by DIL and HCNTs, this immunosensor had a high sensitivity. Furthermore,
the fabrication process was simplified because the antibody was immobilized
directly by DIL.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SEM Characterization of DIL–HCNTs
The surface
characteristics of the HCNT before and after being
functionalized with DIL were investigated by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Figure 1). DIL–HCNTs
(Figure 1B) maintained
the helical structure of HCNTs (Figure 1A) and looked thicker because DIL covers on the surface
of HCNTs.24

Figure 1 SEM images of HCNTs (A)
and DIL–HCNTs (B).

2.2 CV Characterization of the Modified Electrode
In order to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of
the electrochemical immunosensor, cyclic voltammetry (CV) results
were measured in 5 mmol/L potassium ferricyanide/potassium ferrocyanide
at a scan rate of 100 mV/s from −0.2 to 0.6 V. As shown in Figure 2, the CV curve of
the bare Au electrode (Figure 2a) was a typical redox wave. Because of the obstruction electron
and mass transfer of Nafion film, no peak could be observed on CV
curve (Figure 2b) when
the electrode was covered with Nafion. Contrarily, obvious redox peaks
could be observed when the electrode was modified with Nf/DIL–HCNT
film (Figure 2c), which
was attributed to the high conductivity of DIL–HCNTs. After
the modified electrode adsorbed antibodies and antigens, the current
of redox peak decreased (Figure 2d–f) because the electron and mass transfer
had been blocked.

(c), anti-cTnI/DIL–HCNT–Nf/Au (d), BSA/anti-cTnI/DIL–HCNT–Nf/Au
(e), and cTnI/BSA/anti-cTnI/DIL–HCNT–Nf/Au (f) in 5
mmol/L Fe(CN)63–/Fe(CN)64–. Scan rate was 100 mV/s.

2.3 Optimization of the Experimental Conditions
Experimental conditions, such as concentration and immobilization
time of antibody and immunoreaction time between antibody and antigen,
were optimized in order to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of
cTnI detection. The peak current of differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) was used to evaluate the influence of the experimental conditions
on detection of cTnI, and the concentration of cTnI remained at 10
ng/mL in these optimization experiments. According to the results,
the peak current of DPV decreased significantly with the increase
of the anti-cTnI antibody concentration from 20 to 60 μg/mL
but continued to increase the concentration of anti-cTnI antibody,
resulting in a minor change of the peak current of DPV (Figure 3A). Therefore, 60 μg/mL
was the optimal concentration of anti-cTnI antibody. Similarly, DPV
decreased with the prolongation of the fixed time of the antibody
at room temperature and remained stable after 60 min. Similarly, the
peak current of DPV decreased with the immobilization time of the
antibody at room temperature and remained stable after 60 min (Figure 3B). Thus, 60 min
was the select immobilization time of the antibody. Finally, 30 min
was the optimal time for the immunoreaction time between antibody
and antigen at 37 °C (Figure 3C).

Figure 3 Effect of the concentration of antibody (A), immobilization
time
(B), and immunoreaction time (C) on the peak current of immunosensor.
The concentration of cTnI was 10 ng/mL.

2.4 Detection of cTnI
After antibody
reacted with antigen, the immunocomplex formed on the electrode surface
would hinder electron transfer, resulting in the decreasing of the
peak current of DPV. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the
signals corresponding to different concentrations of cTnI were tested. Figure 4 shows that the peak
current decreased with the increasing concentration of cTnI. The inset
indicates a linear calibration that was obtained in the range of 0.05–30
ng/mL. The limit of detection is 0.03 ng/mL determined by 3 σ
rule (where σ is the standard deviation of a blank solution).

Error bars represent standard deviation, n = 3.)
Experiment conditions: potential range: −0.4 to 0.6 V, pulse
amplitude: 0.05 V, pulse width: 0.05 s, sample width: 0.02 s.

Comparing the analytical characteristics
including the detection
limit and linear range of the proposed immunosensor with those of
other cTnI immunosensors, Table 1 demonstrated that the fabricated immunosensor had
a satisfied linear range and a lower detection limit.

2.5 Specificity and Reproducibility of the Immunosensor
In order to investigate specificity of the immunosensor, the peak
current of DPV toward blank solution was measured (48 μA). Carcinoembryonic
antigen, BSA, and α-fetoprotein were used to replace cTnI as
interfering species for immunoreaction. As shown in Figure 5, the peak currents of DPV corresponding to these interfering
species of 20 ng/mL were close to the peak currents of DPV obtained
from blank solution, while the peak current of DPV corresponding to
cTnI (20 ng/mL) was 18 μA. These results indicated that the
DIL–HCNT-modified immunosensor had good specificity.

Figure 5 Specificity
of the immunosensor.

The reproducibility of the proposed immunosensor was also
studied.
The inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation of detected cTnI
(10 ng/mL) were 7.3 and 6.7%, respectively. These results showed that
the prepared immunosensor had good reproducibility.

The immunosensor
retained more than about 95% of the initial values
after storing at 4 °C for 15 days. The results demonstrated that
the designed immunosensor has satisfied stability.

3 Conclusions
Here, an electrochemical immunosensor based
on DIL and HCNTs as
a platform for the determination of cTnI was developed. The nanocomposite
of DIL–HCNTs improved the conductivity of the electrode surface,
resulting in high sensitivity. In addition, the DIL provided two −CHO
groups for antibody immobilization, which simplified the process of
sensor construction. The immunosensor for cTnI exhibited some good
analytical performance such as satisfactory reproducibility and good
specificity. Furthermore, the DIL–HCNT nanocomposite is an
attractive modifying material in the fabrication of other electrochemical
biosensors.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
cTnI and anti-cTnI (anti-cTnI
monoclonal antibodies) were purchased from Shanghai Linc-Bio Science
Co. Ltd. IgG (human immunoglobulin G) and BSA (bovine serum albumin)
were purchased from Beijing Dingguo Biotechnology Company. PBS (0.1
mol/L, phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0) was prepared using Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4, which were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. HCNTs were purchased
from Nanjing Xianfeng Nanomaterial Technology Ltd. Nafion (Nf, 5%,
v/v) was obtained from Sigma Chemical. 4-(Bromomethyl)benzaldehyde,
4,4′-bipyridine, acetonitrile, and N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.

CV and DPV were performed on a CHI
660E electrochemistry workstation (Shanghai CH Instruments, China).
The three-electrode system included a Pt electrode (counter electrode),
a saturated calomel electrode (reference electrode), and a gold electrode
(Au)-modified composite film (working electrode). SEM images were
obtained by using a TESCAN MIRA3 (LMU) microscope.

4.2 Preparation of the DIL–HCNT Composite
4-(Bromomethyl)benzaldehyde
(0.498 g, 2.5 mmol) and 4,4′-bipyridine
(0.156 g, 1 mmol) were added into 20 mL acetonitrile, and the mixture
was refluxed for overnight and cooled to room temperature. Subsequently,
DIL, a yellow solid (0.42 g, yield about 76%), was obtained by filtration.23 The DIL was directly used for the preparation
of DIL–HCNTs without further purification.23

The DIL–HCNTs was prepared according to ref (13) with minor modification.
Typically, 1 mL of HCNTs (dissolved in DMF, 2 mg/mL) was mixed with
4 mL DIL (dissolved in ethanol, 10 mg/mL), and black DIL–HCNT
suspensions were obtained after 1 h with ultrasonication. Subsequently,
this mixture was centrifuged (12 000 rpm, 10 min) and washed
three times with ultrapure water. Then, the DIL–HCNT product
was redispersed into 1 mL ethanol solution of Nf (0.25%, v/v) under
ultrasonication for 10 min. The preparation of the DIL–HCNT
composite is shown in Figure 6A.

Figure 6 Preparation of the nanocomposite of DIL–HCNT (A) and the
electrochemical immunosensor (B).

4.3 Fabrication of the Immunosensor
At
first, a gold electrode (Au, 3 mm in diameter) was successively polished
with 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina slurries and ultrasonication cleaned
in ultrapure water. Subsequently, 10 μL of Nf/DIL–HCNT
solution was dropped on the cleaned electrode and dried in the air.
Then, 10 μL of antibody (60 μg/mL) was dropped on the
Nf/DIL–HCNT membrane-modified electrode and incubated at room
temperature for 60 min. The unreacted antibodies were removed by washing
with ultrapure water, and then, the electrode was incubated for 30
min at 37 °C with 10 μL BSA (2.0 wt %) in order to eliminate
nonspecific binding. Ultimately, 10 μL of antigen solution with
various concentrations was dropped on the surface of electrode and
incubated for 40 min at 37 °C, followed by washing with ultrapure
water and then measuring the electrochemical signals. The whole process
of the immunosensor fabrication is shown in Figure 6B.
