The self-assemblies
of polycyclic aromatic diimide (PAI) compounds
on solid surfaces have attracted great interest because of the versatile
and attractive properties for application in organic electronics.
Here, a planar guest species (coronene) selectively adsorbs on the
helicene-typed PAI1 monolayer strongly, depending on the conjugated
cores of these PAIs. PAI1 molecule displays evidently a bowl structure
lying on the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface due to the
torsion of the “C”-shaped
fused benzene rings. In combination with density functional theory
calculation, the selective inclusion of coronene atop the backbone
of the PAI1 array might be attributed to the bowl structure, which
provides a groove for immobilizing coronene molecules. On the other
planar densely packed arrays, it is difficult to observe the unstable
adsorption of coronene. The selective addition of coronene molecules
would be a strategic step toward the controllable multicomponent supramolecular
architectures.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
self-assemblies on a solid surface are an
interesting subject due to the promising perspectives in the nanotechnology
field.1−3 Although the exploitation of controlled supramolecular
chemistry has reached a maturity level where the specific self-assembly
can be predicted to high accuracy, controllable ordering in the multicomponent
architectures at the molecular scale remains a challenge. To obtain
well-defined complex structures, 2D multicomponent nanostructures
through the selective accommodation of many types of guest molecules
in various host template networks have attracted a great deal of attention
over the past decades.4,5 In most cases, the host molecules
formed 2D solid networks with suitable cavities for guest molecules,
and the inclusion of guest molecules cannot disturb the already existing
host network. The shape and size complementarities between the cavity
and guest molecule play an important role in the nanostructure. On
the other hand, there are a few cases of coassembly in which host
nanostructures on the solid surface were tuned by the inclusion of
guest molecules.6,7 The applications of host–guest
systems for the fixation of functional compounds have been hampered
by the inefficient understanding of the behavior of incorporation
of guest species on the host molecules.

Among the most studied
guest molecules, coronene (Cor), with sixfold
symmetry, displayed a stable adsorption structure on unmodified solid
surfaces, including various metal surfaces8,9 and
the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate.10−12 In most reports, a single coronene molecule or clusters were confined
within various networks.13−27 Note that the uses of coronene to transform the self-assembled surface
structures have also been observed.16,17,19 In addition to the location of coronene in the host
cavity, there are some cases in which coronene molecules are partly
or completely located on the host molecules. Horn et al. found an
ordered second coronene layer on top of the first coronene layer due
to the coronene layer and substrate underneath.28,29 Zhang et al. observed a coronene layer on top of HPB-6pa network,
which might be attributed to the electronic interaction and van der
Waals interactions.30 Note that the cavity
of HPB-6a is slightly smaller than the size of the coronene molecule
by around 0.12 nm. Therefore, the adsorption site of coronene might
be attributed to many factors, like the substrate, the cavity of host
network, the host structure, and so on.

In this study, we designed
four polycyclic aromatic diimide (PAI)
derivatives, namely, PAI1 (N,N′-di(2-octyldodecyl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene-1,2,5,6-tetracarboxyldiimide),
PAI2 (N,N′-di(2-octyldodecyl)benzo[k]tetraphene-5,6,12,13-tetracarboxyldiimide), PAI6 (N,N′-di(2-octyldodecyl)benzo[c]picene-7,8,15,16-tetracarboxyldiimide), and PAI8 (N,N′-di(2-octyldodecyl)benzo[c]naphtho[2,1-k]tetraphene-5,6,14,15-tetracarboxyldiimide),
as the target host molecules (Figure 1), which have the same alkyl chains but different backbone
blocks.31 The branched alkyl side chains
attached on the imide nitrogen atoms help in ensuring the stable adsorption
on the solid surface and the recognizable 2D structure. As a powerful
tool to study the molecular systems adsorbed on flat and conductive
solid substrates, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) showed 2D self-assembled
monolayers formed by PAI derivatives at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface.
Coronene molecules then periodically located on the specific highly
ordered PAI1 host array. In combination with density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, the results showed that coronene can only be immobilized
in the bowl structure, whereas it is unstable on the planar PAI2,
PAI6, and PAI8 monolayers. The formed Cor/PAI1 bilayer structure is
more thermodynamically favorable than that of the PAI1 system. It
is expected that systematic investigations may lead to control the
distribution and dispersion of guest molecules on or in the preformed
arrays on surface.

Results and Discussion
Self-Assembled 2D Structure
of PAIs
First, self-assemblies
of four PAI derivatives were investigated. Figure 2 displays the high-resolution STM images
of 2D molecular organizations. In each STM image, the brighter features
correspond to the conjugated backbone cores of the PAI derivatives,
whereas the darker areas are occupied by the alkyl chains. The orientation
of the backbones is parallel to each other, showing the formation
of striped patterns. It is noteworthy that PAI1 exhibits bright “V”-shaped
protrusion, indicating that the backbone of PAI1 is not parallel with
respect to the substrate surface.31−33 Such nonplanar geometry
might be attributed to the distortion of the C-shaped polycyclic skeletons.
The V-shaped configuration on the HOPG surface might come from the
interaction between the interdigitated alkyl chains as well as the
interaction between alkyl chains and the substrate. For PAI2, PAI6,
and PAI8 molecules, they all exhibit rodlike protrusions in the STM
images, indicating that their backbones are parallel to the HOPG surface.
Therefore, the interactions between adsorbates and the substrate determine
the stable adsorption of molecules on the surface. The unit cells
containing one PAI molecule are superimposed on the STM images, and
the unit-cell parameters are summarized in Table S1.

Figure 2 High-resolution STM images (15 nm × 15 nm) of molecule PAI1
(a), PAI2 (b), PAI6 (c), and PAI8 (d) at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interfaces.
The unit cells are inserted on the STM images. Tunneling parameters:
(a) 298.8 pA, 511.2 mV; (b) 299.1 pA, 567.3 mV; (c) 299.1 pA, 601.5
mV; and (d) 299.1 pA, 623.8 mV.

Although the distances between adjacent molecules are slightly
different, there are great changes in the parameter α in the
range of (82–99) ± 2°, indicating that the relative
orientations of these PAI compounds are largely different. The orientation
of the conjugated cores may be due to the hydrogen bond between −C=O
and H–C of the phenyl ring from adjacent two molecules. One
carbonyl group in PAI1 cannot form a hydrogen bond with the other
adjacent PAI1 molecule because the neighboring backbone of PAI1 rotates
out of the substrate surface. Additionally, the elastic alkyl chains
tend to be out of the surface upon the close-packed surface.34 In the cases of PAI2, PAI6, and PAI8, the carbonyl
groups are on the two sides of the conjugated center; therefore, there
might be two hydrogen bonds marked with red circles between two adjacent
molecules. In these STM images, the widths of dark stripes are measured
to be 1.2 ± 0.2 nm, which are consistent with the length of the
alkyl side chains.

The molecular models (Figure 3) corresponding to STM images were obtained
through
DFT calculation, which further confirm the molecular geometry on the
surface. The calculated interaction energies between adsorbates and
interaction energies between adsorbates and the substrate in these
systems are shown in Table 1. In these four systems, the interaction energies between
adsorbates are around 20 kcal mol–1, which result
from the interactions between interdigitated alkyl chains. Compared
with the other three systems, the slightly smaller intermolecular
interaction in PAI1 might be attributed to the curled alkyl chain
induced by the rotation of the backbone. The much larger interaction
energies between adsorbates and substrates of PAI2, PAI6, and PAI8
than those of PAI1 are consistent with the supposed configuration
of PAI1 above. The differences of adsorbate–substrate interaction
energies between PAI2, PAI6, and PAI8 might be due to the backbones.
These results provide evidence that the molecule–substrate
interaction is the predominant factor relative to the molecule–molecule
interaction. The low total energy per unit area in PAI1/HOPG systems
compared to that of other systems supports the only inclusion of coronene
molecules.

Selective Adsorption of Coronene on PAI1 Surface
Next,
the coadsorption behavior of the guest coronene in these self-assembled
patterns of PAI molecules was investigated. Except for the PAI1 monolayer,
STM observation showed no evidence that the coronene molecule can
be immobilized in other monolayers. In the large-scale STM image of
coronene/PAI1, as shown in Figure S1, the
stripes brighter than those of PAI1 were clearly visible, obviously
indicating the localization of coronene molecules. The high-resolution
STM image, as shown in Figure 4, shows that the V-shaped protrusion of PAI1 becomes circular
spots. A unit cell is superimposed upon the STM image with a = 2.9 ± 0.1 nm, b = 1.3 ± 0.1
nm, and α = 99 ± 2°, which is significantly different
from unit parameters of the parent PAI assembly (a = 2.7 ± 0.1 nm, b = 1.1 ± 0.1 nm, and
α = 92 ± 2°). The width of the bright stripe is consistent
with the diameter of the coronene plane parallel to the HOPG surface.
The cross-sectional profiles (Figure 4b) show that the bright stripe is located higher than
the darker stripe by around 0.1 nm in the PAI1 array, whereas the
bright stripe is located higher than the darker stripe by around 0.2
nm after deposition of coronene. Additionally, competitive adsorption
of coronene on the HOPG surface could not happen because there is
no coronene phase, as has been observed. If coronene molecules preferentially
adsorb on the HOPG surface, the structure of the PAI1 monolayer might
be disturbed. From these factors, the adsorbed coronene molecule is
expected to be located on
the PAI1 conjugated cores.

densely packed

and Cor/API1 monolayer on the HOPG surface corresponding to the STM
images, (c) molecular model in image (a), (d) side view of the molecular
model in (c).

The coronene and conjugated
core of PAI1 cannot be resolved separately
due to the limited resolution. The appropriate position of the coronene
molecules can be identified by DFT calculation. The molecular model,
as shown in Figure 4c, reveals the formation of a two-layer densely packed structure
by specific adsorption of the coronene molecule on the bowl-conjugated
core of PAI1. Coronene displayed parallel configuration to maximize
the interaction between coronene and the substrate.35 The interaction energies, including intermolecular and
molecule–substrate, give more self-assembled information in
the whole system, as summarized in Table 1. The contributions for the stable assembly
of PAI compounds include the intermolecular interaction mainly coming
from the interdigitated alkyl chains and the interaction between PAI1
and the substrate. After addition of coronene molecules, the total
intermolecular interaction energy, including that between PAI1 molecules
and that between coronene and PAI1, was increased to −34.262
kcal mol–1. This might be attributed to the interaction
between the carboxyl oxygen atom and coronene. In other words, the
interaction between coronene and PAI1 contributes to the location
position of coronene. Note that the interaction energies between adsorbates
and the substrate largely increase up to −133.794 kcal mol–1, which indicates that there is a strong interaction
between the coronene/PAI1 system and HOPG substrate. The adsorption
of coronene molecules on PAI1 induced the increased stability of PAI1
on the HOPG substrate, leading to the increased interaction between
PAI1 and the substrate. Therefore, the ordered coronene layer might
be owing to the
PAI1 layer and the HOPG underneath. On the monolayers of PAI2, PAI6,
and PAI8, coronene molecules may tend to move because there is no
groove structure to immobilize the molecules, resulting in that stable
adsorption cannot be observed in STM images. In addition, DFT calculations
showed smaller interaction energies for coronene on these monolayers,
indicating that these are not preferable structures.

The total
energy per unit area obtained through considering all
possible interactions in the system offers an effective factor to
evaluate the thermodynamic stability of different arrays. The selectivity
of immobilization coronene in PAI1 can be explained by smaller total
energy per unit area of PAI1 + Cor/HOPG (−0.458 kcal mol–1 Å–2) system than that of PAI1/HOPG
(−0.237 kcal mol–1 Å–2), indicating the inclusion of coronene make the PAI1 monolayer more
table. This function of stability can be explained by the energy gain.
The resulting interaction between physisorbed host and coronene with
substrate overcomes the instability of the lower density of host matrix.
In presence of coronene guest molecules, the formation of honeycomb
network is thermodynamically favored.6,7 As a result,
the inclusion of coronene molecules in PAI1 monolayer should depend
on the properties of molecular template monolayers.

To study
the electronic interactions between the coronene molecules
and PAI1 monolayer as well as the substrate, we also calculated the
density of states (DOS) to discuss the energy level alignment at the
coronene/PAI1 interface.36,37 In Figure 5, the DOS for PAI1/HOPG and
Cor + PAI1/HOPG are shown. The increased total DOS structures indicate
that strong interaction between coronene molecules and PAI1/HOPG system.
The interaction between PAI1 and coronene molecule is calculated to
be −22.717 kcal mol–1. As shown in the enlarged
DOS diagram, the adsorption of coronene molecules induced the change
of energy-level alignment, which is expected to be used in organic
electronics.

and after adsorption of coronene molecules. Fermi energy is aligned
to 0 eV.

Conclusions
A
series of PAI derivatives assembled into densely packed monolayers,
in which only PAI1 can serve as a template for the immobilization
of coronene molecules. In contrast to the spatial selection in the
cavity, a close-packed coronene molecule atop the PAI1 monolayer has
been observed. The selective incorporation of coronene is explained
by the interaction energy on the basis of the theoretical calculations.
Many systems for further symmetrical studies are needed to study the
structures of templates which can adsorb coronene molecules, and it
is necessary to further explore efficient recipes to distinguish clearly
the specific position of guest molecules in the close-packed monolayer.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The syntheses of PAI derivatives were carried
out according to the previous report.31 Self-assembled PAI monolayers were prepared by directly dropping
the dilute solution of PAI derivative in 1-phenyloctane onto the freshly
stripped HOPG (grade ZYB) surface, which was purchased from Agilent.
The concentration of the solution was prepared to be less than 1.0
× 10–4 M to ensure the formation of highly
ordered structures. The solution of coronene in 1-phenyloctane with
the concentration of 1.0 × 10–2 M was prepared
and then was directly dropped onto the PAI monolayer. After a while,
a drop of 1-phenyloctane solution was deposited onto the preprepared
surface followed by STM record.

Measurement
STM
measurements were performed at the
1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface at room temperature (22–25 °C)
by using a Nanoscope IIIa (Agilent) with tips mechanically formed
from Pt/Ir (80/20). To obtain the topography image, constant-current
STM was performed by continuously adjusting the vertical position
of the STM tip. All of the tunneling conditions were given in the
corresponding figure captions.

Calculations
Theoretical
calculations were performed
using the DFT-D scheme provided by DMol3 code.38 We used the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) to describe
the 2D periodic structure on the graphite in this work. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
parameterization of the local exchange correlation energy was applied
in local spin density approximation to describe exchange and correlation.
All-electron spin-unrestricted Kohn–Sham wave functions were
expanded on a local atomic orbital basis. For the large system, the
numerical basis set was applied. All calculations were all-electron
ones and performed with the medium mesh. The self-consistent field
procedure was done with a convergence criterion of 10–5 au on the energy and electron density. Combined with the experimental
data, we have optimized the unit-cell parameters and the geometry
of the adsorbates in the unit cell. When the energy and density convergence
criterion are reached, we could obtain the optimized parameters and
the interaction energy between adsorbates. To evaluate the interaction
between the adsorbates and HOPG, we design the model system. In our
work, adsorbates consist of π-conjugated benzene rings. Because
adsorption of benzene on graphite and graphene should be very similar,
we have performed our calculations on infinite graphene monolayers
using PBC. In the superlattice, graphene layers were separated by
35 Å in the normal direction. When modeling the adsorbates on
graphene, we used graphene supercells and sampled the Brillouin zone
by a 1 × 1 × 1 k-point mesh. The interaction
energy Einter of adsorbates with graphite
is given by Einter = Etot(adsorbates/graphene) – Etot(isolated adsorbates in vacuum) – Etot(graphene). For the DOS calculations, k-point samplings for the Brillouin zone were performed
using the 5 × 5 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh.
