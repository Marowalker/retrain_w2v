Industrial
modernization causes severe contamination of water resources
due to which the presence of organic dyes poses a great threat to
human life. To address this, we have synthesized a hydrogel GSCg using
graphene oxide (GO), sulphonatocalix[4]arene (SC4a), and l-Cys by heating at 90 °C for 30 min and characterized by analytic,
spectroscopy, and microscopy techniques. The GSCg possessing porous
structure and adsorbs all three types of dyes, viz., eosin yellow
(anionic), neutral red, and methylene blue (cationic), as shown by
scanning electron microscopy, and the adsorption kinetics are addressed.
The dye adsorbed by the gel (dye@GSCg) has been degraded by the treatment
of Cu2+/N2H4, which regenerates the
gel. The regenerated gel has been demonstrated for further cycles
of adsorption followed by degradation. Alternatively, the degradation
of the organic dyes was also demonstrated by an in situ approach by
taking GO, SC4a, l-Cys, and the organic dye together and
subjecting the mixture to hydrothermal conditions and the process
leaves out free gel (GSCgd). This was proven to be true in the case of each of the 12
dyes studied individually and also for their mixture, supporting that
this methodology can be employed for large scale purification of contaminated
water with high efficiency. GSCgd was repeatedly used for the adsorption and
degradation (with the use of Cu2+/N2H4) cycles wherein the gel does not lose its adsorption capability
even after several cycles. Therefore, {GO···SC4a} hybrid
is a smart, sustainable, and reusable material suitable for the purification
of water contaminated with industrial organic dye effluents.

Introduction
Industries based on
textile, paper, plastic, leather, and cosmetics
continuously discharge several contaminants into the environment,
in which the major proportion is organic dyes. This causes severe
pollution and thereby poses a great threat to the life of plants,
animals, and human.1,2 These contaminants are carcinogenic
and mutagenic and cause respiratory diseases, skin dermatitis, and
eye irritation.3 The sustainable means
of purification of such water resources from the contamination of
organic dyes is in high demand. In the literature, various photocatalysts,
reagents like H2O2 and NaBH4 are
used for the degradation of organic dyes.4−9 For adsorption of dyes, the adsorbents, such as nanomaterials based
on proteins and organic molecules, hydrogels, zeolites, carbon nanotubes,
activated carbon, functionalized graphene, and chitosan, are reported
in the literature.10−20 Among these, graphene/graphene oxides (GOs) are widely utilized
materials because of their large surface area, high mechanical strength,
and thermal stability and hence are used in designing different materials
suitable for application in optoelectronics, biosensors, catalysis,
and electrochemistry.21−26

On the other hand, the hydrogels are generally formed by cross-linking
of the corresponding monomer unit and these are used in drug storage
and delivery, sensing, and water purification.27−31 The hydrogels give an advantage with regard to water
purification as the material can be easily separated out from the
medium after the treatment. For additional advantages, such as high
surface area and easy separation, the graphene-oxide-based hydrogel
would be of immense importance and such a material has been synthesized
for the adsorption of organic dyes.30,31 Therefore,
in this paper, we report a porous hydrogel (GSCg) synthesized from
the functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with sulphonatocalix[4]arene
(SC4a) at a relatively lower gelator concentration. The details of
the adsorption and degradation of organic dyes have been demonstrated
by analytic, spectroscopy, and microscopy techniques, and our methodology
has been applied successfully to purify bulk water containing 12 dyes
together.

Results and Discussion
Formation of the Gel, GSCg
The functionalization
of
GO and/or rGO renders it to interact with organic molecules through
noncovalent interactions.32−34 Therefore, GO is expected to
form a supramolecular assembly with SC4a to give {GO···SC4a}
via π···π interactions extended between
the π segment of SC4a and the highly conjugated π system
of GO. All of this is expected to simplify the requirements for the
gelation. Thus, both GO and SC4a were mixed together in aqueous form,
and the gelation was initiated by the addition of l-Cys followed
by heating. The use of l-Cys in the gelation stems from a
literature report where the use of a mixture of GO, l-Cys,
and ammonia resulted in the formation of the gel in 3 h when heated
at 90 °C.33 After going through the
corresponding experimental iterations given in Figure S01, the optimal parameters for the GSCg formation
are determined and these are (i) a 1:3 w/w ratio of GO vs SC4a, (ii)
2 mg/mL gelator concentration, (iii) 30 min of reaction time, and
(iv) 3 mg of l-Cys as binder. The well-formed gel is separated
out of the aqueous medium.

The modification of GO by SC4a decreases
the gelation time drastically from 3 h that is reported in the literature
to 30 min in the present case. No ammonia was used, and only a low
concentration of l-Cys was used in our case. The decrease
in the gelation time is primarily attributed to the enhanced interactions
between GO and SC4a. It is known in the literature that the heating
of l-Cys releases H2S,35,36 which acts as a reducing agent and will covalently cross-link the
{GO···SC4a} hybrid via the sulfide (C–S–C)
linkage, as depicted in Figure 1a, and the gel turns less hydrophilic and hence separates
out of the medium. The control experiment was carried out at room
temperature with only the GO but without SC4a or l-Cys did
not yield any gel. The gel was confirmed by inverting the glass slide
and sustains a weight ∼2500 times its own weight with a ∼40%
compression in the height, as can be noticed from Figure 1.

after inversion. Photographs showing the stress sustainability of
GSCg: (d) before (normal state), (e) during, and (f) after the stress
is removed. Stress of 50 g of weight is applied.

Characterization of the Gel, GSCg
The GSCg gel was
characterized by analytic, spectroscopy, microscopy, and diffraction
techniques. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals that almost
90% of the total weight of the gel is water (Figure 2a). Further, the gel was freeze-dried to
remove the water and was analyzed. Both SC4a and GO exhibited ∼20
and ∼15% weight losses, respectively, up to 100 °C, which
correspond to the loss of water. An additional 30% weight loss was
observed in both the GO (up to 330 °C) and SC4a (up to 270 °C)
due to pyrolysis of the functional groups. However, in the case of
the gel GSCg, the weight loss is ∼75% up to 300 °C. The
functionalization of GO with SC4a is supported by comparing the IR
spectra of GO and GSCg (Figure 2b). The peak corresponding to the C=C stretching frequency
was shifted from 1620 to 1626 cm–1 on going from
GO to the gel GSCg. The presence of νS–O vibration
of the sulfonato group at 1040 cm–1 in the gel indicates
the attachment of SC4a to graphene oxide. As given in Figure 2c, the dispersion of GO shows
two absorption bands, one at 230 nm and the other at 300 nm, whereas
SC4a shows single absorption band at 277 nm. In the case of GSCg,
only one absorption band was observed at 282 nm, supporting the presence
of SC4a. The diminishing of the absorption band observed at 300 nm
supports that the GO is successfully modified to its reduced state.
The X-ray diffractograms clearly support that the SC4a is highly crystalline
and GO is partially crystalline as compared with the gel (Figure 2d). The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of S 2p of {GO···SC4a}
hybrid exhibits two bands, one at 166.4 (2p3/2) and the
other at 167.7 eV (2p1/2), and these peaks correspond to
the ‘S’ from sulfonato groups. In addition, the gel
shows a new band at 163.4 eV (Figure 2e), which supports the presence of the sulfide linkage
(C–S–C) that results in the formation of a graphene
oxide-based three-dimensional (3-D) architecture. Whereas the G and
D Raman bands of graphene oxide are observed at 1590 and 1350 cm–1, respectively, in GO, these were shifted to 1575
and 1355 cm–1 in the GSCg gel (Figure 2f). The 15 cm–1 blue shift observed in the G band is attributed to the thermal reduction
of GO during the gelation. Even the integrated intensity ratio (ID/IG) increases
from 1.05 to 1.23 upon gelation, which is attributed to an increase
in the number of sp3 defects.37

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of GSCg were recorded
in the cryo mode to obtain its surface morphology, and the pore structure
of GSCg is clearly seen in the images given in Figure 3a. The size of the pores varies from 0.3
to 1.6 μm with a weighted average of 0.84 μm (Figure 3b). To support that
the 3-D pore network is formed through the C–S–C link,
elemental distribution, including of sulfur, was mapped by ESEM and
the micrographs clearly show the distribution of all constituting
elements, viz., C, O, and N, including S, all over the surface (Figure 3c–h).

Adsorption Properties of
Organic Dyes by GSCg
Owing
to the porous nature of the gel, GSCg has been studied for its ability
to adsorb organic dyes. Since GSCg exhibited adsorption of organic
dyes irrespective of their charge, two cationic (MB, CV), two anionic
(MO, EY), and one neutral dye (NR) were chosen for the study. Photographs
of the vials given in Figure 4a reveal that all five dyes studied are decolorized after
the adsorption by GSCg. The dye-adsorbed gel is referred as dye@GSCg,
where the dye used is MB, CV, NR, MO, or EY. The decrease in the absorbance
of the supernatant solution with time shows that the dye is adsorbed
by the gel (Figures 4b,c and S02). According to the absorption
spectral data obtained, it is understood that almost 80–90%
of all dyes are removed from solutions within 10 h of incubation (Figure 4d). The time taken
for 50% removal (T50, min) of the dye
follows a trend, viz., EY (220) > MO (169) ∼ MB (168) >
NR
(90) > CV (25), suggesting that the process is not dependent on
the
charge of the dye and there is a 9-fold decrease in the T50 on going from EY to CV (Figure 4e). At saturation (i.e., 3× highest T50), the percent of dye removal is marginally
higher in the case of cationic and neutral dyes as compared with the
anionic ones.

(g) only GSCg, (h) NR@GSCg, (i) MB@GSCg, (j) MO@GSCg, (k) EY@GSCg,
and (l) CV@GSCg.

The adsorption isotherm
data for the EY@GSCg, NR@GSCg, and MB@GSCg
fits to both the Langmuir as well as Frendluich isotherm models (Figure S03), whereas a better fit was observed
in the case of Langmuir model (Table S1). The adsorption kinetic data for all of these three dyes follow
a pseudo second order adsorption rate (Figure S04 and Table S1). qmax values obtained from the Langmuir model are 230, 526,
and 426 mg/g for MB, NR, and EY, respectively. These are in good agreement
with the experimentally obtained values of 225, 491, and 405 mg/g,
respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity for GSCg was compared
to that of already known graphene/ graphene oxide-based hydro-/aerogels
in the literature, as given in Table 1. Whereas some of the literature is concerned with
the adsorption of the cationic dyes,38−41 a few papers report the adsorption
of cationic as well as anionic dyes.42−44 The GSCg reported in
this paper shows the adsorption of all three charge types of dyes
and exhibits a higher qmax as compared
with these reports in the literature.

Characterization of Dye@GSCg
The absorption spectra
of dye@GSCg showed the bands corresponding to the dye (400–660
nm) as well as to SC4a (280 nm) (Figure 4f). The GSCg exhibit well defined the 3-D
pore network on the basis of SEM micrographs. The dye-adsorbed gel
exhibits fibril-like structures along the 3-D pore network of GSCg,
as shown in the case of GSCg, MB@GSCg, MO@GSCg, NR@GSCg, EY@GSCg,
and CV@GSCg (Figure 4g–l) by SEM.

To support that the dye was captured by
the gel, i.e., dye@GSCg, FTIR, XRD, and Raman spectra were recorded
and compared to those of the controls. In the fingerprint region in
FTIR spectra, some additional peaks (Figure 5a,d) were observed upon the adsorption of
EY and NR. The powder XRD for EY@GSCg supports the presence of both
components when compared with the XRD pattern of EY and GSCg (Figure 5b), and similar features
were observed even for NR@GSCg (Figure 5e). In Raman spectra, two distinct bands at 642 and
714 cm–1 were observed in the case of EY and the
same were also present in EY@GSCg. Along with this, some additional
peaks were present in the characteristic D and G bands of EY@GSCg
and NR@GSCg as compared with only GSCg (Figure 5c,f).

the same as (a)–(c), respectively, where the dye is NR instead
of EY. Color code: GSCg (black), dye (blue), and dye@GSCg (red).

Recyclability of Adsorption
vs Degradation of Organic Dyes by
GSCg
The recyclability has been demonstrated in the case
of the MB dye. To reuse the gel GSCg for the adsorption of another
cycle of organic dyes, MB@GSCg was dipped in a solution of CuSO4·5H2O (15 mM, 1.8 mL) to which 200 μL
of hydrazine was added and rotated on a tube rotator for 5 h. The
dye adsorbed by the gel is degraded at this stage, as can be noticed
from the SEM micrographs given in Figure 6d upon comparison with Figure 6c. At this stage, the gel was washed with
water and reused for the adsorption of MB again. The whole protocol
was repeated five times, and no change in the adsorption capacity
of GSCg was observed, as understood from Figure 6a,b.

In Situ Degradation of
Organic Dyes
To degrade the
organic dyes in situ, the gelation protocol given in the Experimental Section was followed with the addition
of dye solution. Thus, the ingredients, viz., {GO···SC4a}
hybrid and l-Cys in presence of the dye, when heated at 90
°C result in the gelation while degrading the dye simultaneously.
From the photographs of the vials given in Figure 7, the color of the respective dye is clearly
visible before the gelation, whereas the supernatant solution is completely
decolorized upon gelation. On the basis of extensive studies carried
out, it is understood that the dye is in fact degraded during this
process. The gel formed during the in situ degradation of the dyes
is referred as GSCgd, where d stands for in situ degradation. The degradation
of the dyes has been proven by the following measurements.

Figure 7 Photographs
of the vials containing [{GO···SC4a}
+ l-Cys + dye] before (upper panel) and after degradation
of dyes along with formation of GSCgd (lower panel).

Based on Supernatant Solution
The time-dependent degradation
of EY has been monitored by a decrease in the absorbance with time,
whereas no change was noticed in the case of the control (Figures 8a,b and S05). The histogram clearly shows that more than
70% of the dye is degraded within 2 min and further it degrades by
>95% within 4 min (Figure 8c). The control experiment that is carried out without the
use of SC4a but only using {GO + l-Cys} leads to only 70%
of degradation within 4 min. All this supports that the {GO···SC4a}
hybrid is certainly better and acts faster in degradation as compared
with GO alone. Effectively, the dye degradation is increased to about
150% on going from only GO to the hybrid {GO···SC4a}
whereas l-Cys is used in both cases.

the case of EY upon treatment at 90 °C: (a) for [{GO···SC4a}

treatment with [l-Cys] (black bar), [l-Cys + SC4a]
(red bar), [l-Cys + GO] (blue bar), and [l-Cys +
{GO···SC4a}] (olive bar).

Based on GSCgd Formed
In all 12 dyes studied, no band corresponding
to the dye was observed in the supernatant after the degradation (Figures 9a,b and S06) and the Figure 9c provides a histogram of all results together.
The absorption spectral measurements of dispersed gel showed only
one band at 282 nm that corresponds to the SC4a and no band corresponding
to the dye was observed (Figure 9d), supporting that the dye has been degraded whereas
SC4a is intact.

micrographs of GSCgd gel formed upon in situ degradation for (e) CV, (f) MB, (g)
NR, (h) MO, and (i) for EY.

Based on the Morphology of GSCgd by SEM
The SEM micrograph showed
porous network of the GSCg filled with fibrillar structures when adsorbed
by the dyes, viz., MB, CV, NR, MO, and EY, whereas upon degradation,
the gels showed only a porous structure that is not filled with any
fibrils. All of this supports that the dyes are degraded during the
gelation shown in Figure 9e–i.

Based on Mass Spectral Studies
As
the dye is degraded
during the formation of the gel, the supernatant solution was checked
to identify the degraded products by mass spectrometry. In the case
of RhB, a peak corresponding to the intact dye was observed at m/z = 443.23 (Figure 10a) before the degradation whereas peaks
were exhibited at m/z = 123.04,
138.99, 149.02, 179.08, and 241.02 after the degradation and these
peaks correspond to the oxidatively degraded products given in Figure 10b. Similar mass
spectral studies were carried out in the case of four other dyes,
viz., BB, CR, MO, and MB, and the peaks corresponding to the degraded
products and their structures are given in Figure 10c,d. After the degradation, no peak corresponding
to the intact dye was observed.

mass spectral data obtained for the degradation in the case of the
five dyes. (d) Chemical structures of the degraded products of the
dyes as given in (c). Raman spectra of the dye (blue), dye@GSCg (red),
and dye-degraded gel GSCgd (black) in the case of (e) EY and (f) CV.

Based on Raman Spectroscopy
The
in situ degradation
of dyes has been supported by Raman spectroscopy, and this is clearer
upon comparing the spectra of simple dyes to those of the gel after
adsorption (dye@GSCg) followed by degradation (GSCgd). It can be seen from Figure 10e,f that the peaks
corresponding to EY and CV are present in the gel after adsorption
whereas no such peak is observed in the case of the GSCgd.

Degradation
of the Mixture of Dyes
Since several dyes
are always present together in contaminated water, degradation experiments
were carried out for different combinations of organic dyes, viz.,
A + A, A + C, A + N, N + N, N + C, C + C, and A + N + C, where A,
N, and C stand for anionic, neutral, and cationic dyes, respectively.
It can be seen from Figures 11a,b and S07 that even the mixture
of 12 dyes taken in a total volume of 500 mL degrades immaterial of
the charge nature of the dye taken in the mixture for the study. This
is prepared by taking 20 mL of 500 mg/L solution of each dye and diluting
the mixture to give a final volume of 500 mL. To this mixture, the
{GO···SC4a} hybrid and l-Cys were added and
instantaneously heated at 90 °C to avoid any precipitation. After
heating, the reaction mixture was filtered from the dispersed gel
material and the filtrate was colorless (Figure 11c), which supports that this material can
be used for a large scale water treatment to remove organic dye contaminants.

of dyes: (a) A + C and (b) N + C. Here, A, C, and N refer to anionic

of the mixture of 12 dyes (EY, MO, CR, BPB, RB, MB, R6G, CV, RhB,

Readsorption of Organic Dyes by GSCgd
The gel GSCgd has been formed when the in situ
dye degradation experiment was carried out, and this is true in the
case of all 12 organic dyes studied. The GSCgd formed during the degradation of EY
was further checked for the adsorption of organic dyes. Just like
the gel GSCg, the gel GSCgd was able to remove all three types of dyes,
viz., cationic, anionic, and neutral, from their aqueous solutions
to an extent of >90% (Figures 12a–c and S08). The
SEM micrographs of dye@GSCgd show a fibril structure along with porous
network of the gel (Figure 12d–f).

and (c) MB. SEM micrographs for the dye@GSCgd with the dyes: (d) EY, (e) NR, and (f)

Recyclability of Adsorption
vs Degradation of Organic Dyes by
GSCgd
To reuse the gel MB@GSCgd, the dye should be degraded and the same is achieved by the
treatment of {CuSO4 + N2H4}. The
SEM micrographs given in Figure 13c,d clearly support the dye degradation. This gel GSCgd was further used
for five adsorption–degradation cycles and it was found that
its adsorption capacity does not alter significantly even after performing
all of these cycles (Figure 13a,b).

removal of dye vs number of adsorption–degradation cycles in

Comparison of qmax of the Gel GSCg
with GSCgd
Materials for 12 different adsorbents have been generated by carrying
out in situ dye-degradation that we reported in this paper, wherein
all three types of dyes have been used. To compare the adsorption
efficiency among these adsorbents, nine different qmax values were derived by using three different gels.
Thus, the gels formed during the degradation of EY (anionic), NR (neutral),
and MB (cationic) were demonstrated separately to obtain qmax and the corresponding data are given in Table 1 (Figure S09). This data resulted in almost 15–30% of increase
in qmax values as compared to those of
the gel GSCg. All of this has been compared with the data reported
in earlier papers in the literature, as given in Table 1. Thus, almost 100 mg/g of additional
dye has been removed by using GSCgd. This is much greater than that using GSCg.

Conclusions and Comparisons
The
supramolecular assembly of sulphonatocalix[4]arene-coated graphene
oxide {GO···SC4a} hybrid has been successfully employed
to make the hydrogel (GSCg) when reacted with l-Cys at 90
°C. The {GO···SC4a} hybrid forms a good dispersion
in water, and l-Cys would easily link these hybrids using
their −COOH and −NH2 groups. At high temperature, l-Cys releases H2S that acts as a reducing agent
and leads to the formation of 3-D network of {GO···SC4a}
hybrid via C–S–C linkage resulting in the formation
of the gel. During the gelation, some of the oxygen functional groups
are reduced, resulting in a decrease in the hydrophillicity of the
gel and hence it separates out from water. The hydrogel formed has
been fully characterized using TGA, XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy,
and the porous structure of the gel has been well confirmed by SEM.
The GSCg adsorbs all five dyes irrespective of the nature of their
charge of whether these are anionic, cationic, or neutral. The maximum
adsorption capacities (qmax) were 225,
526, and 405 mg/g for MB, NR, and EY, respectively. The qmax observed by GSCg is comparable or better when compared
to that of the graphene/graphene oxide-based gels reported in the
literature, as given in Table 1. Comparison of this data reveals that only our gel GSCg is
able to remove all three types of dyes, viz., anionic, cationic, and
neutral, with rather high qmax values
whereas no other reported graphene hydro-/aero-gel has all of these
qualities together.

As per the detailed studies carried out
in the case of the dyes,
viz., MB, NR, and EY, the corresponding data follow Langmuir adsorption
isotherm and pseudo second-order kinetics. In the SEM micrographs,
the dye-adsorbed gel (dye@GSCg) exhibited fibril structures in association
with its porous network as a characteristic signature of the adsorption
of the dye. The absorption spectra of dye@GSCg gel showed
bands corresponding to both SC4a and the dye, supporting the presence
of the dye in the gel. Since the gelation took place with partial
reduction of graphene oxide, organic dyes are oxidatively degraded
during the gelation (GSCgd). This kind of degradation is green since no harmful radiations
and/or hazardous oxidizing/reducing agents were used in the process.
The degradation of the organic dyes has been proven by different spectroscopy
and microscopy techniques. To scale up the in situ dye degradation
process, 500 mL of contaminated water possessing 12 different organic
dyes has been purified and showed the applicability of the {GO···SC4a}
hybrid for the purification of bulk contaminated water. The gel formed
during the in situ degradation of EY was further used for the adsorption
of organic dyes and it was found that this gel GSCgd retains all its dye adsorption
characteristics similar to the other gel GSCg. As given in Scheme 1, both GSCg and GSCgd are equally efficient
in the degradation of dyes and in both cases, the gels are recyclable.

and GSCgd Gels
in Their Action in Degrading Organic Dyes
In summary, the {GO···SC4a} hybrid and
the gels
GSCg and GSCgd reported in this paper are ideal materials for the removal and degradation
of dyes for new generation water purification systems.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis and Characterization of p-Sulfonatocalx[4]arene
(SC4a)
para-Sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4a)
was synthesized according to the reported procedure,45 and the product was characterized by ESI-MS, 1H, and 13C NMR (Figure S10).
ESI-MS: HRMS [M + H]+ (m/z) for C28H24O16S4 = 745.002
(calcd), 745.004 (obtained). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O): δ = 7.51 (s, 8H, ArH), 3.92 (s, 8H, ArCH2Ar). 13C NMR (100 MHz,
D2O): δ = 156, 133, 131, 126, 32.

Synthesis of
3-D Graphene Hydrogel (GSCg) Based on {GO···SC4a}
Hybrid
GO was synthesized by the chemical modification of
graphite according to the modified Hummer’s method46 and was characterized by absorption, XRD, and
IR spectroscopy and the morphology, by SEM and TEM (Figure S11). GO (50 mg) was dispersed in 5 mL of milli Q water
using bath sonication. To this dispersion, 150 mg of SC4a was added,
followed by sonication for 30 min and then stirring for 24 h to result
in the formation of {GO···SC4a} hybrid. Three mg of l-Cys and 400 μL of Milli Q water were added to 100 μL
of {GO···SC4a} hybrid to get a final concentration
of 2 mg/mL. The mixture was sonicated for 2 min, followed by heating
at 90 °C for 30 min without stirring. All of this leads to the
formation of GSCg hydrogel, and the gel was washed thoroughly with
milli Q water. To optimize the parameters affecting the gelation,
different experiments were carried out and the optimum conditions
were worked out. The formation of the gel was identified by visual
observation as well as by physical tests.

Characterization of the
Gel (GSCg)
Photographs
were taken during the formation of the gel GSCg by a digital camera
and were processed using ImageJ software. XPS was carried out on AXIS
Supra instrument of Kratos Analytical with an analysis chamber pressure
of <2.0 × 10–9 Torr and take-off angle of
90°. The X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out using
an X’Pert Pro instrument by PANalytical with the X-ray generator
functioning at 40 KV and 30 mA of current. To find the features of
D and G bands, Raman spectra were measured. The surface morphology
of the gel was studied by a JSM-7600F field emission gun scanning
electron microscope in cryo mode. Before recording the images, the
sample was frozen in liq. N2 and was fractured and sputtered
for 30 s.

Dye Adsorption by GSCg
Two milliliters of 100 mg/L
aqueous solution of an organic dye was added to the GSCg, and 100
μL was taken out after a fixed interval of time for absorption
measurements. The dyes studied were methyl orange (MO, anionic), eosin
yellow (EY, anionic), neutral red (NR, neutral), methylene blue (MB,
cationic), and crystal violet (CV, cationic). The amount of dye being
adsorbed was derived from the absorbance data collected at their respective
λmax values. The adsorption capacity qe, amount of dye adsorbed in milligrams per unit mass
of the adsorbent in grams, has been calculated as qe = (co – ce) × V/m, where co and ce are the
initial and equilibrium concentrations (mg/L) of the dye, V is the volume in liters, and “m” is the mass of the dried adsorbent in grams. The adsorption
data for the dye has been fitted to both the Langmuir and Freundlich
adsorption isotherm models.

In Situ Dye Degradation
Five hundred
milligrams per
liter of different dyes, EY, MO, congo red (CR, anionic), bromophenol
blue (BPB, anionic), rose bengal (RB, anionic), MB, rhodamine6G (R6G,
cationic), CV, rhodamine b base (RhB, cationic), acridine orange (AO,
neutral), bismarck brown (BB, neutral), and NR, were used (Scheme S01) as the contaminants present in water
for the formation of the gel while carrying out in situ degradation
of the dyes. In the degradation experiment, a protocol similar to
that used for making the gel was adopted but the water is replaced
by the dye solution. Both formation of the gel and decolorization
of dyes due to the degradation were followed by recording their photographs
with a digital camera. The degradation was monitored by absorption
spectroscopy, and the degraded products were identified by ESI-MS.
