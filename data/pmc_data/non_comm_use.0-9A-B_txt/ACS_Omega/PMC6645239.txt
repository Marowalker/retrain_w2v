An ultraviolet-enhanced
(UV-enhanced) nitric oxide (NO) sensor
based on silver-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoflowers is developed using
a low-cost hydrothermal method. The results indicate that silver (Ag)
ions were doped into the ZnO nanostructure successfully, thus changing
the morphology. In the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
images, we also found that some Ag ions were separated out onto the
surface of the ZnO nanoflowers and that the Ag-doped and Ag nanoparticles
improved the sensing property. The NO sensing property increased from
73.91 to 89.04% through the use of a UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED).
The response time was approximately 120 s without the UV-LED, and
the UV-enhanced Ag-doped ZnO nanoflower sensor exhibited a reduced
response time (60 s). The best working temperature could be reduced
from 200 to 150 °C using UV light illumination, and it was found
that the NO response increased by 15.13% at 150 °C. The UV photoresponse
of the Ag-doped ZnO nanoflowers and the mechanisms by which the improvement
of NO sensing property occurred through the use of UV light illumination
are discussed. The property of the gas sensor can be calibrated using
a self-photoelectric effect under UV light illumination. These interesting
UV-enhanced Ag-doped ZnO nanoflowers are viable candidates for practical
applications.

1 Introduction
Currently,
many researchers have studied the detection of nitric
oxide (NO) because of environmental problems, such as the greenhouse
effect and health-related problems, such as itching, breathing, and
asthma.1 NO gas is a forerunner of acid
rain and ozone-depleting substances. The concentration of NO can influence
the chemical reaction time in the environment. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) indicated that the prevalence of
pulmonary edema and fatality rates will increase when people are frequently
exposed to NO gas. The permissible exposure limit of NO is 25 ppm,
as indicated by OSHA.2 Furthermore, airway
inflammation, such as bronchiectasis3 and
asthma,4 can be detected by the concentration
of exhaled NO as a biomarker. Previous studies have reported that
transcriptional regulation and ion channel functions are influenced
by NO, and thus neuron death caused by neurodegenerative diseases
can be implied by the level of NO. Overall, asthma patients breathe
out high concentrations of NO of approximately 35–50 ppb, which
is 3–4 times higher than that breathed out by healthy people.4

Semiconductor metal oxides have been widely
applied in gas sensors
for over several decades because of their unique advantages,5 including low cost, high gas sensitivity, and
excellent integration with silicon microfabrication.6 Zinc oxide (ZnO) has a hexagonal structure, lattice constants
of a = 0.324–0.326 nm and c = 0.513–0.543 nm, a high band gap energy (∼3.4 eV),
and a high exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature, which
makes it one of the most popular and most widely used gas-sensing
metal oxides7 for the detection of environmentally
harmful and toxic gases such as nitric oxide (NO),8 ethanol,9 ozone (O3),10 carbon monoxide (CO),11 and sulfur dioxide (SO2).12 Recently, ZnO nanostructures, such as nanorods,
nanowires (NWs),13 nanoflowers (NFs),14 nanotubes,15 and
nanosheets,16 have been fabricated with
optimized gas-sensing properties, which have been achieved by their
high surface-to-volume ratio and their unequal physical and chemical
properties originating from their microscopic sizes. Generally, low
operating temperature fabrication is necessary for low-cost sensors,
which is compatible with glass and even plastic substrates. Previously,
a novel acetone gas sensor was reported with a low working temperature
of 270 °C based on ZnO nanoneedles, which was fabricated with
Ag-doped ZnO by Raffah et al.17 Lee et
al. reported that urchin-like Mg-doped ZnO NWs can detect ethanol
in high humidity situations.1 Thus, ZnO
nanostructures can enhance the sensing properties of gas sensors.

Despite these advantages, the working temperature of ZnO gas sensors
is defined as approximately 300 °C.18 Several methods have been published to reduce the working temperature
of ZnO sensors, such as ultraviolet (UV) illumination,19 microheater chips,20 and metal doping.21 In a previous report,
ZnO microwire gas sensors optimized by surface etching and UV illumination
were introduced by Wang et al.22 Gas-sensing
measurements provide a novel application to optimize the property
of gas sensors working at low temperatures by using a photoinduced
effect. Choopun et al. reported an ethanol response enhancement of
ZnO nanostructure sensors exposed to UV illumination.23 A UV-enhanced ozone gas-sensing response of ZnO–SnO2 heterojunctions at room temperature was reported by Aguir
et al.24 Recently, a wide variety of ZnO
nanostructures doped with noble metal Ag have become popular research
area because of their unique properties. Pan et al. reported that the ZnO optical properties are enhanced by
silver doping. Zhang et al. reported that
Ag-doped ZnO nanostructures have enhanced gas-sensing response properties.25 To our knowledge, works on gas sensors with
ZnO/Ag NFs grown using the hydrothermal method are rare. The advantages
of sensors with NF structures are low working temperature and high
sensitivity.

In this work, the approach mentioned above was
applied for the
optimization of NO gas-sensing response and working temperature by
using Ag-doped ZnO NFs as the active sensing material and it was expected
that the fabricated UV-enhanced Ag-doped ZnO NFs would improve NO
sensing performance. Last, the potential sensing mechanism of NO derived
from the UV-enhanced Ag-doped ZnO NFs was also discussed with regard
to the properties of NO response with and without UV enhancement.

2 Experiments
2.1 Preparation of Ag-Doped
ZnO NFs and Gas-Sensing
Devices
The Ag-doped ZnO NFs were grown with a low-temperature
hydrothermal process using zinc nitrate hydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O], hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, HMTA), and silver nitrate (AgNO3). To synthesize the Ag-doped ZnO NFs, aqueous solutions of
0.06 M zinc nitrate and 0.06 M HMTA were mixed under regular stirring
for 20 min at 90 °C and then mixed with 1, 2, and 3 mM AgNO3 solutions. The final solution was stirred for 40 min, and
the temperature was maintained at 95 °C as illustrated in the
following equation26 1  

Deposition of the ZnO nanostructure
occurred according to the following equation 2  

After stirring, the solution was immediately
transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave, which was sealed and heated up to 120 °C for 6 h.
After the completion of the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to
room temperature and the samples were cleaned with deionized (DI)
water and dried in air. Before the hydrothermal process, a 100 nm
thick ZnO film was fabricated on the substrate as a seed layer using
radio frequency sputtering and annealing at a temperature of 550 °C
in air for 5 min.

The as-fabricated Ag-doped ZnO NFs with 4
mol ratios of Ag and
ZnO were prepared using the hydrothermal process described in the
above paragraph. The gas-sensing devices were labeled AG0Z, AG1Z,
AG2Z, and AG3Z, respectively, corresponding to the pure ZnO NWs, 1
mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs, 2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs, and 3 mM Ag-doped ZnO
NFs (Table 1). Figure 1 shows a schematic
of the Ag-doped ZnO NF structure and the microfabrication process
of the gas sensors used in this study. The gas-sensing devices were
fabricated by using a 450 nm platinum (Pt) micropatterned interdigital
transducer (IDT) electrode with electron beam evaporation. A specific
location and region of the synthesized Ag-doped ZnO NFs were defined
by photoresist. Then, the devices were placed in the hydrothermal
process solution and heated up to 120 °C for 6 h. Last, the photoresist
was slightly lifted off in acetone, isopropanol, and DI water and
then annealed at 550 °C in air for 5 min.

2.2 Characteristics
and Sensing Tests
The morphology of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs
was characterized with an
ultrahigh-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM; Hitachi
SU8000, Japan) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope
(HR-TEM; JEOL JEM-2100F CS-STEM, Japan). The Ag-doped ZnO NFs were
analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; 18 kW rotating anode X-ray
generator, Rigaku) and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy
(KIMMON, IK3552R-G, Japan).

A UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED)
was chosen as the light source to enhance the gas-sensing device (LED,
wavelength = 325 nm), and the spacing between the UV-LED and the gas
sensors was 1.5 cm. A source meter (Keithley 2400) connected each
gas-sensing device to a personal computer for data processing. The
property of the gas sensor was tested based on the resistance of the
sensing device in various gases with an accurate concentration in
a test chamber (20 L). The sensing devices were operated under UV
irradiation and in the dark.

The response, S, is defined by the following equation 3  where Rair and Rgas are the resistance of the sample
in air
and in a test gas, respectively.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterizations of the
Materials
Figure 2 shows the
ZnO nanostructures doped with different Ag concentrations measured
using HR-SEM. Figure 2a–c displays SEM top-view images of the sample that are evidence
of the NF structure morphology of the Ag-doped ZnO nanostructures. Figure 2a shows an SEM image
of AG1Z, which demonstrates that the synthesized ZnO nanomaterials
doped with a low Ag concentration exhibit low-density flower-shaped
morphologies. Figure 2b exhibits the SEM top-view image of sample AG2Z, which clearly shows
that the density of the as-synthesized NFs has increased. The as-fabricated
Ag-doped ZnO NFs consist of several triangular-shaped petals and curved
bases. These curved bases are associated with the petals in an appropriate,
unique way, where nanostructures with beautiful flower-like morphologies
are created. The most common diameters of the Ag-doped ZnO NF petals
are ∼300 nm. The lengths of the petals range from 4 to 5.5
μm, and the size of a single flower is measured to be approximately
7 μm. The SEM top view of sample AG3Z is shown in Figure 2c. It is evident that the dimension
of Ag-doped ZnO NFs corresponds to the Ag concentration. The dimension
of a single NF structure increased to almost 10 μm. The insets
of Figure 2a–c
show the HR-SEM top-view images for AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z, respectively.
It can be seen that the morphologies are all similar, but the dimension
and the density increase with the amount of Ag-doping. The SEM cross-sectional
images of the AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z samples are shown in Figure 2d–f, respectively. From Figure 2d–f, it can
be seen that the average lengths of AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z are 3.89,
4.29, and 5.87 μm, respectively. It is obvious that a higher
concentration of Ag doping influences the dimension, density, and
length of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs. This trend is similar to that previously
reported by Rajasekaran et al.27

Figure 2 SEM top-view
images of (a) 1 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG1Z), (b) 2
mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG2Z), and (c) 3 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG3Z),
and SEM cross-sectional images of (e) 1 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG1Z),
(f) 2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG2Z), and (g) 3 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG3Z).

The crystal phase of the pure
ZnO NWs and the Ag-doped ZnO NFs
with different Ag concentrations was determined using XRD. As shown
in Figure 3, the sharp
diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns are generally identified as
the characteristics of the ZnO hexagonal wurtzite (JCPDS no. 36-1451).
The XRD patterns demonstrated that pure ZnO NWs and Ag-doped ZnO NFs
have related peak intensities and shapes similar to those of the ZnO
hexagonal wurtzite structure. In the AG3Z sample, diffraction peaks
observed at angles of 2θ degree of 31.88°, 34.52°,
36.46°, 47.76°, 56.84°, and 63.12° correspond
to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), and (103) reflections of the
crystal planes of the hexagonal wurtzite zinc oxide, respectively.
Additionally, there are no diffraction peaks related to the Ag element,
which is perhaps because of the low doping concentration of Ag. High
intensities of the ZnO(002) peak were obviously observed in the pure
ZnO NWs (AG0Z) and Ag-doped NFs (AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z), which were
located at 34.66°, 34.61°, 34.57°, and 34.52°,
respectively. Figure 3b shows a comparison of all of the samples. The Ag-doped samples
(AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z) were demonstrated to slightly shift toward
a smaller angle. This slight shift in the diffraction peaks was due
to an increase in their lattice constants by the substitution of Zn2+ ions (ionic radius 0.74 Å) with larger Ag+ ions (ionic radius 1.15 Å). This trend for the Ag-doped ZnO
nanostructures has already been observed in a previous report.28

XRD patterns of the (002) peak.

PL emission spectroscopy is a reliable measurement, especially
for measuring structural defects and energy bands in materials. The
PL emission of ZnO has been previously presented. Voigt et al.29 reported a correlation between PL and oxygen
vacancies for ZnO, and Lam et al.30 presented
a correlation between PL spectra and ZnO nanostructures related to
the gas-sensing property. In previous studies, the silver doping effect
on the PL properties of zinc oxide has also been reported. Figure 4a shows the PL emission
spectra of pure ZnO NWs (AG0Z) and Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG1Z, AG2Z, and
AG3Z). The PL peaks of AG0Z, AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z can be found at
378, 385, 389, and 392 nm, respectively. This UV emission is commonly
attributed to the near band edge emission and originates from the
recombination of the free excitons through an exciton collision process.31 The obvious red shift in the PL emission in
Ag-doped ZnO NFs indicated the existence of an anisotropic energy
band of the flower-like ZnO nanostructures. The broad band with a
visible green emission near 625 nm is normally believed to be a result
of structural defects and the radiative recombination of electrons
and photogenerated holes in the crystal, such as oxygen vacancies
and zinc interstitials.32 In the present
work, the broad peak at approximately 625 nm may be attributed to
the fabrication process in a poor oxygen environment because of the
hydrothermal reaction in the sealed Teflon-lined autoclave. Therefore,
some O2– vacancies might appear in the samples.33 On the other hand, the change in the internal
samples was already discussed in a previous report.34 The induced hybridization leads to the replacement of Zn2+ ions by Ag+ ions in the crystals and a donor-derived
impurity band because of the charge transfer to unoccupied 3d states
at the ZnO Fermi level.35Figure 4b exhibits the absorbance spectrum
of AG2Z. A wide optical absorption range below 375 nm can be found
due to the band–band transition of the ZnO wurtzite hexagonal
structure.36 The absorbance measurement
using UV–vis spectroscopy for Ag-doped ZnO NFs did not show
any significant change in the absorption spectrum when Ag was doped
into the ZnO lattices. The results of this study are similar to those
of a previous report by Zhu et al.37

Figure 4 (a) PL spectra
of pure ZnO NWs and Ag-doped ZnO NFs. (b) UV–vis
spectrum of as-synthesized Ag-doped ZnO NFs.

HR-TEM was performed to prove the doping of Ag into the ZnO
structure,
as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a demonstrates
the fragments of Ag-doped ZnO NFs scraped from the sample. It was
found that the average size of the Ag atoms ranged from 9 to 15 nm,
and some of Ag ions were separated out onto the ZnO NF surface. The
high-resolution images in Figure 5b showed that the spherical Ag atom was attached to
the ZnO NFs very well, and the diameter of the distributed Ag atom
was around 12 nm. Figure 5c,b presents the lattice fringes with the Zn and Ag d-spacings,
which were 0.264 and 0.241 nm, corresponding to the crystallographic
(002) plane of ZnO and the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic
Ag atoms, respectively.38Figure 5e,f shows the selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirming the existence of ZnO
and Ag. Figure 5e shows
the SAED patterns of the ZnO NFs, indexed as (1̅100), (011̅0),
(101̅0), (1̅010), and (112̅0) planes, which illustrates
the good hexagonal single-crystalline ZnO structure. Figure 5f presents an SAED image of
the Ag doping atoms, where circular rings can be found that correspond
to the polycrystalline crystallographic (111), (200), and (220) planes.39Figure 5g shows the elemental mapping for a selected area of the Ag-doped
ZnO NF sample as a pink rectangular frame, which indicates a uniform
distribution of the Ag element (green) in the sample. Moreover, the
other elements are also presented, such as Zn (red) and O (yellow).
Thus, the measurements of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectra
and mapping are consistent with the HR-TEM results (for more details
see Figure S2).

3.2 NO Sensing Performance
The nitric
oxide (NO) sensing properties of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs are shown in Figure 6, where it can be
seen that they have good sensitivity and response time in air under
dark conditions. Figure 6a shows that the NO response of 2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs (AG2Z) is higher
than that of the pure ZnO NWs (AG0Z) at 200 °C and that the responses
of AG2Z and AG0Z were 78.95 and 68.75%, respectively. This result
indicates that silver doping and precipitated silver ions can improve
the response, similar to the findings of a previous report.40Figure 6b shows the NO sensing response of sample AG2Z at temperatures
ranging from 100 to 300 °C, where the responses of 21.6 ppb NO
are 53.28, 73.91, 78.95, 75.00, and 67.25% at 100, 150, 200, 250,
and 300 °C, respectively. The response of NO increased to a maximum
with the temperature raised to 200 °C, and the response of NO
decreased at 250 °C. Figure 6c provides a comparison of the NO responses of all
sensors (AG0Z, AG1Z, AG2Z, and AG3Z) at different working temperatures.
It can be seen that Ag doping improved the NO sensing properties of
ZnO nanostructures and that the best sensitivity was achieved with
sample AG2Z.

Figure 6 (a) Sensing properties of the pure ZnO NWs (AG0Z) and
the 2 Mm
Ag-doped ZnO NF (AG2Z) for 21.6 ppb NO gas. (b) Time-dependent NO
responses of the 2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NF sensor at different working
temperatures. (c) Comparison of the responses to 21.6 ppb NO for all
sensors at different temperatures.

Figure 7a
presents
the measurement of sample AG2Z toward different concentrations of
NO at 200 °C. The resistance of AG2Z monotonically increased
when the NO concentration increased from 7.2 to 36 ppb. The AG2Z responses
of AG2Z to 7.2, 14.4, 21.6, 28.8, and 36 ppb NO were 63.28, 71.06,
78.95, 86.52, and 90.14%, respectively. The slope of the sensing response
to different NO concentrations was 0.960, which is a very linear rise,
as shown in the inset of Figure 7a. Figure 7b shows the repeatability of sample AG2Z. The variation in
the sensor response was less than 4% for a 21.6 ppb NO injection with
five switching on/off cycles, indicating the reliability and stability
of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs. The responses of the Ag-doped ZnO NF sensor
toward 21.6 ppb testing gases including NO, SO2, formaldehyde
(HCHO), ethanol, and CO were further measured, to check the selectivity
of the sensor. As shown in Figure 7c, the responses of the sensor to NO, SO2, HCHO, ethanol, and CO are 78.95, 15.91, 10.63, 8.05, and 5.97%,
respectively. It was also found that the Ag-doped ZnO NF sensor had
a higher selectivity toward NO gas compared with the Ag-doped sensor. Figure 7d shows the relative
humidity (R.H.) effect on the response of 2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs toward
21.6 ppb NO at 200 °C. The sensing response decreased when the
relative humidity increases. The sensing response is 66.46, 59.67,
49.02, and 39.01% in 25, 45, 65, and 85% R.H., respectively, as the
result is similar to the previous report of Lu et al.41 Overall, it was found that the NO sensing property of the
ZnO nanostructure can be optimized with Ag doping, Chen and Tsang42 reported a similar observation of Ag-doped WO3-based sensors for the detection of NO.

In this study, we improve the gas-sensing properties of Ag-doped
ZnO NFs using UV illumination. Above all, Figure 8a shows the resistance response to UV-LE
at different working temperatures for sample AG2Z. The UV photoresponses
of AG2Z were approximately 45.3, 31.2, 15.1, 7.2, 4.9, and 1.8% at
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 °C, respectively. It is obvious
that the photoelectron activation leads to a drastic decrease in resistance
when the sensor is exposed to UV light. The UV-LED obviously impacts
the response of the sample at lower temperatures. Conversely, the
effect of UV-LED at high temperatures is quite limited because the
thermal activation of electrons is more significant than the UV effect.
The ZnO band gap of ZnO partially overlaps with the broad bandwidth
of the UV-LED. The response and recovery times are 120 and 122 s,
respectively, without UV-LED, whereas they can be reduced to 60 and
120 s, respectively, when UV is on for optimization of the sensor
(for more details see Figure S1). Thus,
UV light can still stimulate the generation of carriers and accordingly
raise the density of the free electron–hole pairs in ZnO even
though the intensity of radiation is not at a maximum value near the
ZnO energy band gap.43 The inset in Figure 8a presents the response
of sample AG2Z when exposed to UV light at 150 °C. Figure 8b shows the response of sample
AG2Z toward 21.6 ppb NO gas injection under UV-on and UV-off conditions.
At the same working temperature, the measured responses of the sample
AG2Z were 89.04 and 73.91% under the UV-on and UV-off conditions,
respectively. It is obvious that the response of sample AG2Z to the
21.6 ppb NO gas injection increased by approximately 16% when the
UV light was on as compared to the UV-off condition. In addition,
the response and recovery times were also optimized when the sample
was exposed to the UV-LED. The results suggest that the Ag-doped ZnO
NF sensing device exhibits an increased response and optimized recovery
time for NO gas under a UV-LED.

Ag-doped ZnO NFs at different working temperatures (inset: the UV
response of the 2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs). (b) Responses of the sample
2 mM Ag-doped ZnO NFs to 21.6 ppb NO under UV-on and UV-off conditions
at 150 °C.

Figure 9a shows
the response of all samples to NO gas injection under UV illumination
at 150 °C. Figure 9b shows the responses of the AG0Z and AG2Z sensing devices to NO
gas injection under UV-on and UV-off conditions at different working
temperatures ranging from 50 to 300 °C. Overall, the AG2Z UV-on
responses were higher than the UV-off responses, especially at 150
°C. The response still exhibited a slight increase when the temperature
was over 250 °C. It was also found that the original optimal
working temperature for AG2Z is 200 °C without the UV-LED, but
the best working temperature can be reduced to 150 °C under UV
light illumination, where the response of the AG2Z to NO gas also
increases. Conversely, the response of the pure ZnO NWs (AG0Z) toward
NO gas decreased with UV-LED illumination. The responses of all sensing
devices toward NO gas injection were compared under UV-on and UV-off
situations at 150 °C, as shown in Figure 9c. It was found that the sensing action capability
with the UV-LED can be affected by Ag doping. On the other hand, UV
illumination had almost no influence on the pure ZnO NWs. Table 2 shows a comparison
of the NO responses for both the pure ZnO NWs and the Ag-doped ZnO
NFs with UV illumination. All of the sensing device responses toward
NO gas injection based on the Ag-doped ZnO NFs were improved when
the UV light was on. The optimal response to NO gas was achieved with
the 2 mM Ag-doped (AG2Z) sample under both UV-on and UV-off conditions,
and more Ag doping did not improve the NO response property. Additionally,
it is also the importance of sensors operating at room temperature.
Unfortunately, the response time was too long in our study. We will
consider using metal nanoparticles to optimize the sensing properties
of metal oxide sensor materials such as gold and palladium in a future
work by Pinna et al.44

3.3 UV-Enhanced
NO Sensing Mechanism
O2 can be easily adsorbed
onto the surface of Ag-doped
ZnO NFs because of the extensive surface-to-volume ratio, which produces
lower conductivity in the depletion layer (O2(gas) + e– → O2–(adsorption)).45 The electron–hole pairs of ZnO are produced
under UV-LED illumination. The light-generated holes migrate to the
surface under the potential gradient, and then oxygen is desorbed
from the ZnO surface because of band bending (O2–(adsorption) + h+ → O2(gas)).46 Thus, the concentration of free carriers increases,
which reduces the thickness of the depletion layer when the NO gas
is injected under the UV-on condition. The generated photoelectrons
easily react with the NO molecules because of the electron affinity
of ZnO according to the following equation8 4  

Figure 10 shows
the UV-LED-enhanced sensing mechanism
and the energy band bending of the pure ZnO NWs and Ag-doped ZnO NFs.
The green region indicates the conduction channel. DZnO and DAZO are the diameters
of the pure ZnO NWs and Ag-doped ZnO NFs, respectively. The widths
of the electron-depleted layers are represented by LZnO and LAGZ for the pure
ZnO NWs and Ag-doped ZnO NFs, respectively. VS(1) implies the magnitude of the interfacial potential in
the dark. As a result, the control of the Debye length (L ≈ λD) by acceptor doping with silver ions
may be the possible mechanism by which to explain the UV-LED-influenced
response of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs in this study. The thickness of the
Debye length for the surface layer and the interfacial potential are
as follows47 5   6  where ε is the dielectric constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute
temperature in kelvin, q is the unit electron-charge,
and Qs is the charge density of the surface.

Figure 10 Diagrams
of the UV-enhanced mechanism of pure ZnO NWs and Ag-doped
ZnO NFs. (a,b) Schematic of the pure ZnO NWs with and without UV-LED
(the double red circles represent adsorbed oxygen molecule on the
surface, and the green region represents the conduction channel).
(c,d) Illustrations of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs under UV light illumination
and in the dark. The schematic figure was drawn referring to Adelung
et al.52

Because of the high formation energies, the incorporation
of Ag
at the interstitial (Agi) sites and the oxygen sites (AgO) is more difficult than the incorporation of Ag at the Zn
sites (AgZn).48 The net donor
density (ND) decreases because the substitution
reaction of silver ions generally replaces the Zn2+ ions
as acceptors in ZnO, as shown in previous studies.49 Thus, the increase in ND leads
to an increase in λD, following eq 5. Qs increases
due to the reduced defect-surface ratio and causes VS to increase (eq 6). Therefore, through eq 5, it can be found that the thickness of the electron-depleted
layer, LAGZ, increases more than that
of LZnO, which results in the conduction
channel of the Ag-doped ZnO NF (DAGZ)
being narrower than that of the pure ZnO NWs (DZnO). Additionally, the value of L has to
be small because the electron-depleted layer thickness can be effective
with regard to avoiding the flat-band condition.50 According to a previous report, qVS(1) and ND(ZnO) were ∼1.45
eV and ∼1018 cm–3, respectively,
and the thickness of the electron-depleted layer was predicted to
be ∼35 nm (LZnO) at room temperature
for pure ZnO NWs.51 On the other hand,
the LAGZ, qVS(1), and ND(AGZ) of Ag-doped ZnO NFs were
∼115 nm, 1.55 eV, and ∼1017 cm–3, respectively.52 It can be seen that
Ag doping can have an effective impact on the morphology and the property
of a ZnO nanostructure. Figure 10a,b shows the electron–hole pairs of pure ZnO
NWs without and with UV-LED enhancement. Figure 10c,d shows the electron–hole pairs
of Ag-doped ZnO NFs under the UV-on and UV-off conditions. The thicknesses
of the electron-depleted layer, LZnO(UV) and LAGZ(UV), decreased because the
photogenerated holes migrated to the surface, and the surface electron–hole
recombination could be discharged by adsorbed oxygen ions (h+ + O2(ad)– → O2(g)).47

According to the nanostructure
characterization presented above,
it can be inferred that the properties of the Ag-doped ZnO NF sensor
were improved more than those of the pure ZnO NW sensors under UV-LED
illumination. This is similar to the previous study by Lupan et al.,52 which reported that a narrower conduction channel
of the silver-doped zinc oxide single NW leads to photocurrent enhancement.
Interestingly, the same interaction can be observed for the UV-LED-enhanced
Ag-doped ZnO NF sensor in this study. These results suggest that Ag
doping enhances the sensing property for light-induced gas-sensing
applications at low temperatures.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated an NO sensor based on Ag-doped ZnO
NFs using a hydrothermal method and UV-LED illumination was successfully
applied to improve the properties of the NO sensor. The results indicate
that the working temperature of the Ag-doped ZnO NFs enhanced by UV-LED
illumination can be reduced to 150 °C. The NO response time was
reduced by half (60 s) with a UV-LED, whereas the response time was
120 s without the UV-LED. The response of NO increased from 73.91
to 89.04% under UV light illumination at 150 °C. This enhancement
can be explained by a narrower conduction channel in the Ag-doped
ZnO NFs with UV-LED enhancement. The selectivity of NO gas was significant,
and the response of NO was also highly sensitive, ranging from 7.2
to 36 ppb and was repeatable (variation was less than 4%). The results
of this study indicated the noteworthy potential of nitric oxide gas
sensors for applications in disease detection in the human body and
as environmental monitors in the future.
