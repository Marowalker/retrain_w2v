The synthetic water-soluble
polymer, partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide
(HPAM), has been most widely used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR);
however, its poor thermal stability and weak salt tolerance impede
further application in high-temperature and high-salinity oil reservoirs.
To address such deficiencies, three polysaccharides, xanthan gum,
diutan gum, and scleroglucan, were examined in comparison with HPAM
on rheological behaviors, shearing resistance, long-term thermal stability,
and core flooding test. It was found that all of these three polysaccharides
were less sensitive to salinity and shearing time, while HPAM showed
a monotonous decrease in viscosity with increasing monovalent cations
and shearing history. After 90 days of aging at 85 °C and 10.1
× 104 mg·L–1 of total dissolved
solids with 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1 of Ca2+, the viscosity of diutan gum and scleroglucan
solutions nearly remained unchanged; on the contrary, the viscosity
of xanthan gum and HPAM solutions drops massively. Core flooding tests
at 85 °C with the same initial viscosity demonstrated that all
polymers showed good transportation in porous media, and 16, 13, and
11% of oil recovery were obtained by diutan gum, scleroglucan, and
xanthan gum, respectively, while only 10% was obtained from HPAM.
These comparative results may underpin the potential of diutan gum
and scleroglucan to be used in the EOR process in HTHS oil reservoirs.

1 Introduction
Water-soluble
polymers, mainly partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide
(HPAM), have been widely used in the chemically enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) process. Relative to the water flooding process, addition of
HPAM in the displacing fluid can further recover 5–30% of original
oil in place1 by enlarging the sweep efficiency
and increasing the oil/water mobility ratio.2,3 With
HPAM being used in the chemical EOR process, around 14 million tons
of incremental crudes is produced annually in Daqing Oilfield, China,
owing to its mild reservoir conditions (T = 45 °C;
the dissolved solids, TDS = 4.5 × 103 mg·L–1). However, the intrinsic salt sensitivity and poor
thermal stability severely impede its use in harsh high-temperature,
high-salinity (HTHS) oil-bearing strata underground, such as the class
III reservoirs in Shengli Oilfield, China (T = 80–95
°C, TDS > 3 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] > 2.0 × 102 mg·L–1). Therefore, water-soluble polymers with improved
salt tolerance
and better thermal stability are highly desirable. In the polymer
flooding operation, a high molecular weight water-soluble polymer,
polyacrylamide or its derivatives, is added to thicken the displacing
fluid, so as to reduce the mobility of the aqueous phase, enlarge
the swept volume, and , consequently, to improve oil recovery efficiency.4,5 Additionally, polymer adsorption onto the rocks decreases the permeability
to water, and the viscoelasticity of the polymer solution can increase
the microscopic displacement efficiency.6

As a typical linear anionic polyelectrolyte, HPAM can make
fresh
water viscous in small dosages under a less hostile environment, nevertheless,
its thickening power and oil recovery ability are strongly weakened
under HTHS conditions. Monovalent cations such as Na+ and
K+ present in brine can shield the electrostatic repulsion
among the carboxylate charges (−COO–) along
the HPAM chains, causing polymer chain coils to collapse.2 Divalent ions, particularly Ca2+ and
Mg2+, would complex with −COO–, leading to the precipitation of HPAM in brine.4,5 Moreover,
the elevated temperature can accelerate the hydrolysis of amide (−CONH2) groups to −COO–, aggravating the
electrostatic shielding effect and complexation with divalent cations.
When the divalent cations in brine exceed 200 mg·L–1, the ceiling temperature for HPAM used in the EOR process should
be lower than 75 °C.3,6

To address these
challenges, great efforts have been made to improve
the thermal stability and salt tolerance of the synthetic polymers.
Copolymerizing acrylamide with thermally stable sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane
sulfonic acid, vinylpyrrolidone, or comonomers containing imide rings
can effectively enhance the salt tolerance and thermal stability.7−9 However, the thermal stability
and salt tolerance of the above copolymers are limited, depending
on the content, cost, and reactivity of functional monomers. In addition,
−CONH2 groups, the majority part along the copolymer
chains would inevitably be hydrolyzed at high temperatures. Other
modified synthetic polymers, such as hydrophobic-associated polymers
or thermoviscosifying polymers, are still altered on the backbone
of HPAM.10−12 Thus, the long-term aging stability cannot be maintained
at high temperatures, restricting their applications in HTHS reservoirs.

Alternatively, polysaccharides may be better candidates for EOR
in the HTHS hostile environment. Xanthan gum (Scheme S1) has been widely applied during the EOR process.13 Negatively charged pyruvate molecules wrapped
around the main chain of xanthan gum to impart to it a rigid rod-like
structure, contributing to its excellent resistance to shearing degradation.14 Nevertheless, the unordered coil conformation
conversion occurs under high temperature conditions,15 with the temperature tolerance limited below 90 °C.3 Fortunately, the newly developed diutan gum and
scleroglucan may overcome these defects and take the place of xanthan
gum.

Diutan gum (Scheme S1), produced
by
the genus Sphingomonassp, is an anionic extracellular polysaccharide. Vicious aqueous solutions
of diutan gum show a strong ability of water retention capacity, salt
tolerance, suspending power, and thermal stability ranging from 5
to 150 °C.16,17 As an effective thickening agent
to maintain free water in cement-based materials and prevent the separation
of concrete,18 it is widely used in concrete
industries such as self-compact cement and plaster. While it was reported
that diutan gum can also be used in drilling and spacer fluids in
the petroleum industry,17 the study for
EOR has been rarely reported. Xu et al. utilized diutan gum in enhanced
heavy oil recovery at 75 °C and TDS of 9503 mg·L–1, with 25.1% heavy oil recovery efficiency compared with water flooding.19

Scleroglucan (Scheme S1) is a neutral
polysaccharide produced by fermentation of a plant pathogen fungus
genus Sclerotium, also with excellent
insensitivity to salt and temperature. The semi-rigid structures of
scleroglucan provide thermal stability to its aqueous solutions at
high temperatures,20,21 and charge neutrality enables
it to be insensitive to electrolytes. Owing to these unique properties,
scleroglucan was used in food and cosmetic industries,22 and petroleum may be another potentially promising
domain. Akstinat23 found that scleroglucan
remained stable at 80 °C for 3 months under highly saline conditions.
Rivenq and coworkers24,25 observed high retention viscosity
for scleroglucan in seawater at 90 °C. Kalpakci et al.26 showed that scleroglucan solutions displayed
improved thermal stability at 93 and 100 °C in seawater with
a TDS of 3.0 × 104 mg·L–1.

Because of these promising features, diutan gum and scleroglucan
are expected to be used in HTHS reservoirs, however, there is still
a lack of detailed research particularly comparison and core flooding
results aiming at the HTHS environment. In this work, we examined
the thickening ability, shearing stability, and long-term stability,
as well as core flooding tests of diutan gum and scleroglucan under
a typical HTHS oil reservoir environment (TDS = 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 ×
103 mg·L–1, T =
85 °C), in comparison with HPAM and xanthan gum. The main aim
of this study is to explore the potential application of polysaccharides
at HTHS conditions and illuminate why polysaccharides exhibit better
performance over HPAM. Our work indicated that both diutan gum and
scleroglucan possessed much better salt tolerance, long-term thermal
stability, and higher oil recovery efficiency over HPAM and xanthan
gum. These findings may widen the applications of these newly developed
polysaccharides and pave the way for seeking potential EOR polymers
used in the HTHS environment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Rheological Behaviors of Polymer Solutions
2.1.1 Temperature Dependence of Polymer Solutions
A steady
rheological test and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) observation were combined together to study the influence of
temperature on the properties and microstructure of polysaccharides
and HPAM solutions, and a high salt environment would cause a negative
effect on the TEM observation, so polymer powders were dissolved in
pure water during the study of temperature dependence of polymer solutions.
To reach the same initial viscosity (28.0 mPa·s) with 0.1 wt
% diutan gum in pure water at 25 °C (γ̇ = 100 s–1), the plot in Figure S1 was used to determine the concentration of polysaccharides and HPAM. Figure 1 compares the viscosity
variation of HPAM and three polysaccharide solutions with increasing
temperature. The above polymer solutions all exhibited thermo-thinning
behavior: the viscosity of HPAM and xanthan gum solutions decreased
dramatically with increased temperature, while the viscosity of diutan
gum and scleroglucan solutions were less reduced. At 85 °C, the
viscosity retention (Φ) (Table S1) of diutan gum and scleroglucan solutions were 73.6 and 73.8%, respectively,
while xanthan gum and HPAM solutions were only 49.8 and 42.9% separately.
It is worth noting that scleroglucan solutions have a viscosity retention
of 72.3% at 150 °C, with potential to be applied to more hostile
conditions.

Figure 1 Apparent viscosity plotted as a function of temperature for polysaccharide
and HPAM solutions (no salt, γ̇ = 100 s–1).

Generally, the entanglements of
macromolecules and the strength
of the network for polymers are mainly formed by van der Waals forces
and hydrogen bonds.27 Nevertheless, the
increasing temperature accelerates the motion of the molecules and
then weakens these molecular forces. Obviously, both diutan gum and
scleroglucan exhibited lower insensitivity to temperature compared
to xanthan gum and HPAM, just as shown in Figure 2a1,a2,b1,b2, the dense network structures were formed, no matter
at 25 or 85 °C. For diutan gum, plentiful water molecules are
still tightly trapped in double helix structures at high temperatures
for the strong internal forces,28 keeping
the water retention constant and higher viscosity remained. The molecular
chains of scleroglucan exist as rod-like structures in aqueous solutions,
beneficial to its stabilities at higher temperatures.29 Conversely, the network structure of xanthan gum was formed
at 25 °C (Figure 2c1) and destroyed at 85 °C (Figure 2c2), it undergoes a conformational
transition from an ordered structure to a random coil. Moreover, the
water molecules clustered around the double helix chains would migrate
away, which results in the decline of viscosity of xanthan gum with
increasing temperature.15 For HPAM, it
formed the coarse and branch-shaped structure at 25 °C (Figure 2d1), while
the backbone of the branch structure was hairline and entangled to
gobbets at 85 °C (Figure 2d2). Hence, diutan gum and scleroglucan solutions
have better thermal stability.

Figure 2 TEM micrographs for diutan gum (a1,a2), scleroglucan
(b1,b2), xanthan gum (c1,c2), and HPAM (d1,d2) at 25 and 85 °C (Cp = 0.05 wt %, no salt).

2.1.2 Salt
Tolerance of Polymer Solutions
The salt tolerance of polymer
solutions with the same initial viscosity
was first investigated at 85 °C, and the results were depicted
in Figure 3. As the
NaCl concentration increased from 0 to 1.0 × 104 mg·L–1, the viscosity of HPAM solutions decreased sharply
from 19.0 to 2.5 mPa·s, with the viscosity retention of only
13.1%. Increasing the NaCl concentration gradually to 20.0 ×
104 mg·L–1, the viscosity of HPAM
(1.5 mPa·s) was approximate to that of brine (1.0 mPa·s).
Comparatively, the viscosity changes of diutan gum, scleroglucan,
and xanthan gum solutions were much lower as the concentration of
NaCl increased from 0 to 20.0 × 104 mg·L–1, with the viscosity retentions of 94.3, 99.5, and
87.2%, respectively.

Figure 3 Apparent viscosity and viscosity retention (ψ) plotted
as
a function of NaCl concentrations for different polymers (T = 85 °C, γ̇ = 100 s–1).

Generally, cations in brine have
two side effects on anionic polyelectrolytes,
namely, the electrostatic shielding and the hydrated layer compression
around polyelectrolyte molecules.30,31 Both the two
adverse influences would cause the decrease in viscosity of polymer
solutions. In HPAM solutions, the existence of Na+ could
screen the negative charge repulsion along the HPAM chains, forcing
the polymer chains to coil and reducing its hydrodynamic volume.32 Double electrical layers on HPAM molecular chains
were compressed for the increase of ionic strength, resulting in a
decrease in viscosity of HPAM solutions. For biopolyelectrolytes,
xanthan gum, and diutan gum, their side chains wrap around the main
chain to make the rod-like structure in the presence of salt.14,33 Negative charges along diutan gum chains locate on the backbone
of the helix structure which can be protected by pendant chains, effectively
restricting the electrostatic effect.34 It is inevitable that Na+ would compact the peripheral
hydrated layer around long-chain molecules, decreasing the viscosity
of diutan gum and xanthan solutions. The nonionic polysaccharide structure
explains its insensitivity to salt.35 Consequently,
polysaccharides were virtually independent of the ionic environment.

2.1.3 Concentration Dependence of Polymer Solutions
Figure 4 shows the
variation of viscosity with different concentrations for polysaccharides
and HPAM in brine (TDS = 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1) at 85 °C. Apparently, the apparent viscosity
of polysaccharide solutions increased more rapidly with the increased
concentration, while that of HPAM solutions was only increased slightly.
To achieve the same apparent viscosity (19.0 mPa·s) of 0.1 wt
% of diutan gum, 0.25 wt % of scleroglucan and xanthan gum were needed.
Meanwhile, for HPAM, it required a much higher concentration, reaching
at about 0.5 wt % to attain the same apparent viscosity under identical
conditions.

Figure 4 Apparent viscosity plotted as a function of concentration for different
polymer solutions in brine (T = 85 °C, TDS =
10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1, γ̇ = 100 s–1).

Generally, in polymer aqueous solutions, the macromolecules
greatly
tend to intertwine with each other, and the size of the entanglements
can effectively affect the viscosity of polymer solutions. Stronger
hydrogen bonds would contribute to the greater aggregation and entanglements
of molecular chains. Under the HTHS environment, the size of the polysaccharide
aggregates was obviously greater than that of HPAM, and in turn polysaccharides
showed better thickening ability than HPAM. To further explore the
thickening mechanism of the above polymers at HTHS conditions, dynamic
rheology was performed to study their viscoelastic behavior at different
polymer concentrations.

Figure 5 shows the
frequency dependence of the dynamic elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G″) for polysaccharide
and HPAM solutions at 85 °C. For diutan gum and scleroglucan
solutions, the crossover was at the middle frequency between G′ and G″ at the solution
concentrations of 0.1–0.3 wt %, indicative of the existence
of the viscoelastic fluids or entangled system. Correspondingly, as
displayed in TEM images (Figure 2a2,b2), network structures were
even well shaped at 85 °C. Accordingly, the crossover frequency
decreased while the plateau elastic modulus, G0, increased, showing that the intensity of the temporary network
greatly enhanced with the increasing number of junction points caused
by the increasing concentration of diutan gum and scleroglucan solutions.36 Nevertheless, for xanthan gum and HPAM, G′ was consistently lower than G″ at solution concentrations of 0.1–0.3 wt %, showing
the typical characteristic of viscous fluids. Consequently, the thickening
mechanism of diutan gum and scleroglucan comes from the enhanced temporary
three-dimensional network structures when increasing polymer concentration,37 coinciding with the TEM imaging, while the intermolecular
and intramolecular forces of xanthan gum and HPAM solutions are simply
enhanced without network structures.

Figure 5 G′ and G″ plotted

concentrations in brine at 85 °C (TDS = 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1); (a) diutan gum; (b) scleroglucan;
(c) xanthan gum; (d) HPAM.

2.2 Long-Term Thermal Stability of Polymer Solutions
To examine whether polymer solutions can keep enough viscosity
during a several month-long EOR process, the long-term thermal stability
of polymer solutions should be tested under a simulated environment.38Figure 6 displays the viscosity variation and viscosity retention
of polysaccharide and HPAM solutions aging in brine (TDS = 10.1 ×
104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] =
1.0 × 103 mg·L–1, [NaN3] = 2.0 × 102 mg·L–1) at 85 °C, which mimics the typical oil reservoir environment
in Shengli Oilfield, China. Clearly, the viscosity of scleroglucan
and diutan gum solutions nearly remained unchanged after aging for
90 days at 85 °C. Conversely, the apparent viscosity of xanthan
gum and HPAM solutions decreased from 19.8 to 3.1 and 20.0 to 3.2
mPa·s, respectively. In conclusion, diutan gum and scleroglucan
solutions had better long-term thermal stability than xanthan gum
and HPAM.

Figure 6 Apparent viscosity and viscosity retention (ψ) plotted as
a function of aging time for different polymer brine solutions at
85 °C (TDS = 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1, γ̇ = 100 s–1).

The remarkable declining viscosity of HPAM at 85 °C
may be
attributed to the thermal degradation during the aging time. The −CONH2 groups along the HPAM chains were easily hydrolyzed at 85
°C, as was discussed in the “Introduction” part, the increased hydrolysis degree will aggravate the
electrostatic shielding effect and make HPAM chains complex with Ca2+, adverse to the long-term stability of HPAM solutions. For
xanthan gum solutions, a severe decrease in viscosity was also observed.
The disordered state at high temperatures caused xanthan molecules
to be more easily attacked chemically.2 On the contrary, diutan gum and scleroglucan showed much improved
long-term stability, indicating that their structures were not destroyed
under this HTHS condition. These findings imply that diutan gum and
scleroglucan are promising to be applied in hostile oil reservoirs.

2.3 Core Flooding
With regard to oil
displacement in reservoirs, identifying the mobility of polymer solutions
in the HTHS environment is of great significance, to ensure whether
these polymer solutions can be smoothly propagated in the porous media.
Therefore, we first evaluated the resistance factor (RF) and residual
RF (RRF) of polysaccharides and HPAM solutions. The mechanical stability
was also measured at higher shear rates for each polymer (Figure S2), which suggests that polysaccharides
would keep relatively good viscosity when exposed to the high shear
rates near the wellbore.

The core flooding tests of polysaccharides
and HPAM were performed at the simulated condition of Shengli Oilfield
(TDS = 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1, T = 85 °C), the concentration of polymer
solutions was selected based on Figure S3. The curves of the flooding pressure with the injected pore volume
(PV) for polymer solutions were compared in Figure 7, RF and RRF were presented in Table 1.

Figure 7 Pressure drop plotted
as a function of injected PV for polysaccharide
and HPAM solutions at 85 °C (TDS = 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1).

Table 1 Mobility of Polysaccharide and HPAM
Aqueous Solutions (T = 85 °C)
core number	samples	ϕ (%)	1 PV (mL)	Kw (mD)	ηP (mPa·s)	RF	RRF	adsorption
value (mg·g–1)	ηef	
1	diutan gum	23.4	34.4	365	18.7	13.0	8.5	0.104	1.53	
2	xanthan gum	20.6	30.3	271	19.2	7.9	5.6	0.152	1.41	
3	HPAM	22.1	32.5	340	19.1	8.7	6.4	0.177	1.35	
4	scleroglucan	21.1	31.1	303	19.2	10.6	7.1	0.127	1.49	
From Figure S5, one can see that the
relative concentration of diutan gum, scleroglucan, xanthan gum, and
HPAM solutions all can be stable after injecting the specified volume
of 5.8 PV, 5.1 PV, 4.7 PV, and 2.8 PV, respectively, implying that
the retention has been dynamically equilibrated and the longer time
was needed for polysaccharides to reach equilibrium of adsorption
retention on porous media. Meanwhile, polysaccharides are more sensitive
to shear and exhibit shear-thin behavior, the viscosity of polysaccharide
solutions entering to the core port is lower than HPAM. Therefore,
the pressure increased slowly with the increased volume of polysaccharide
solutions, along with the balanced pressure delayed (Figure 7). As can be seen in Table 1, the adsorption values
of diutan gum, scleroglucan, xanthan gum, and HPAM solutions were
0.104, 0.127, 0.152, and 0.177 respectively. The molecular weight
of HPAM (1.5 × 107 g·mol–1)
is much higher than polysaccharides (2.0 × 106 to
5.0 × 106 g·mol–1), which can
cause more a significant mechanical entrapment than polysaccharides,39 polysaccharide solutions can possess a higher
effective viscosity in porous media.

It was evident that both
RF and RRF of diutan gum and scleroglucan
were greater than those of xanthan gum and HPAM, which was preferable
for the ability of mobility control. We ascribed this difference to
their viscoelasticity at HTHS conditions, the formed three-dimensional
networks can bring a greater flow resistance and decreased permeability,
along with a higher RF and RRF. As can be seen in Figure 5, diutan gum and scleroglucan
solutions were all viscoelastic fluids, while xanthan gum and HPAM
were only viscous fluids at the HTHS environment. The entanglements
of diutan gum and scleroglucan molecular chains were minimally changed,
intercepted, or recovered rapidly through the pore throat under the
reservoir conditions. Thus, they can efficiently level down the permeability
and keep higher effective viscosity of porous media.40 The adsorption values of xanthan gum and HPAM are higher,
which would be detrimental to the mobility control.

For the
smooth flowing behavior of the above polymer solutions,
the oil recovery was further performed. As depicted in Figure 8, 16, 13, 11, and 10% of the
incremental oil efficiency could be recovered by diutan gum, scleroglucan,
xanthan gum, and HPAM solutions, respectively. In addition, their
mobility ratios were all lower than 1 (Table S2), favorable for the displacing fluids to push out crude oil from
the core holes. All of these polymer solutions could achieve the oil
recovery factor to some extent. Diutan gum and scleroglucan solutions
have a relatively better ability to improve oil recovery efficiency
for their higher effective viscosity during the flooding process.
Xanthan gum and HPAM solutions exhibited a lower oil recovery factor
for their poor performance at HTHS conditions. Consequently, diutan
gum and scleroglucan would be prospective to be used in HTHS reservoirs.

Figure 8 Recovery
factor and pressure drop plotted as a function of injected
PV for polysaccharide and HPAM solutions at 85 °C (TDS = 10.1
× 104 mg·L–1, [Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1). (a)
diutan gum; (b) scleroglucan; (c) xanthan gum; (d) HPAM.

One may doubt the tiny difference in the oil recovery
factor among
these polymers, but we must bear in mind that the 1 day laboratory
core flooding test is just the simulated experiment, which cannot
thoroughly reflect the process of polymer flooding in the real oil
reservoirs. Generally, depending on the well spacing between the injector
and producer, it would take a minimum of six months or years (depending
on the injection rate) for polymer solutions to propagate from the
producer to the injector. Compared to the long-term thermal stability
of polysaccharides with HPAM after being aged for three months in Figure 6, we found that the
viscosity retention of diutan gum and scleroglucan solutions still
exceeded 85%, while xanthan gum and HPAM were less than 20%. This
means that the remaining viscosity of xanthan gum and HPAM cannot
keep them from playing the role of the displacing agent. On the contrary,
the excellent long-term thermal stability of diutan gum and scleroglucan
under HTHS conditions make them good candidates for EOR under a hostile
environment.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
Diutan gum was purchased
from Azelis Co., Ltd. Scleroglucan and xanthan gum were kindly provided
by Huanghelong Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. HPAM (weight-average
molecular weight, Mw = 1.5 × 107 g·mol–1) was supplied by Daqing Oilfield
Company, PetroChina. NaCl, CaCl2, and NaN3 were
all of analytical grade and bought from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagents
Co., Ltd. Dehydrated and degassed crude oil, offered from Daqing Oilfield
Company, PetroChina, was diluted with kerosene to get a viscosity
of 5.8 mPa·s at 85 °C. The artificial cores composed of
sand consolidated by an epoxy resin, with a length (L) of 30 cm and diameter (d) of 2.5 cm, were offered
by Beijing Shidarongzhi Technology Co., Ltd.

3.2 Sample
Preparation
Two types of synthetic
brine were prepared for the salts impacting on polymers and the tests
in a simulative environment; the first one only contained NaCl and
water with different salinity (TDS, 0–20.0 × 104 mg·L–1), and the second class of brine consisted
of water, NaCl, NaN3 (bacteriostat), and CaCl2, with a final TDS of 10.1 × 104 mg·L–1 ([Ca2+] = 1.0 × 103 mg·L–1, [NaN3] = 2.0 × 102 mg·L–1). The polymer solutions were prepared by slowly, uniformly sprinkling
a designated amount of dry polymer powders to the shoulder of the
brine vortex to avoid the formation of “fish eyes”,
then with gentle magnetic stirring at a speed of 60–80 rpm
to keep the solid particles from settling to the bottom and avoid
mechanical degradation of the polymer chains, and finally stirring
hermetically for 1 day prior to the tests.

3.3 Characterization
of Molecular Weight with
Gel Permeation Chromatography
The weight- and number-averaged
molecular weights, Mw and Mn, as well as molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, of polysaccharides were
determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with Malvern TDA
and GPC max systems (Malvern Inc., United Kingdom) equipped with an
A Guard and A6000m General Mixed Aq column (300 × 8.0 mm2 i.d., P/N: CLM3021) coupled in line with VISCOTEK TDA detectors,
and the results were shown in Table 2 and Figure S4. 100 μL
of polysaccharide solutions (0.5 mg·mL–1),
filtered through 0.22 μm membrane filters (Millipore), was injected
into the column. The eluent (0.1 mol·L–1 NaNO3) was used at a flow rate of 0.7 mL·min–1. The temperature of the detector and column was fixed at 45 °C
with a built-in thermostatic system and column oven.

3.4 Rheological Measurements
Temperature
scanning was made on a Physica MCR 302 rotational rheometer (Anton
Paar, Austria) equipped with a high-pressure and high-temperature
cell, in which the concentric cylindrical geometry CC25 with a measuring
bob (radius, 12.55 mm) and a measuring cup (radius, 13.56 mm) was
employed. The steady apparent viscosity was recorded during temperature
ramps going from 25 to 150 °C (heating rate = 2 °C·min–1) at a fixed shear rate (γ̇ = 100 s–1). The pressure in the measuring cup was set at 1
MPa to avoid forming too much vapor to affect the accuracy of the
apparatus. The shear rate was fixed at 100 s–1 to
ensure enough torque and precision in our viscosity measurement at
high temperatures. In addition, for the uniformity of this article,
the shear rate in the viscosity measurement was always fixed at 100
s–1, except for the polymer solutions used in core
flooding. The flow rate of polymer solutions propagating in porous
media is closer to 10 s–1, so the apparent viscosity
of the polymer solutions used in polymer flooding was measured at
10 s–1.

The dynamic rheology of polymer solutions
was also registered on the same rheometer but equipped with concentric
cylinder geometry CC27 with a measuring bob (radius, 13.33 mm) and
a measuring cup (radius, 14.46 mm). The strain amplitude of 2.5% was
selected to ensure that polysaccharide solutions fell within the linear
viscoelastic region, and the mechanical spectra was obtained within
the frequency range of 1–100 rad·s–1 in the oscillation mode.

3.5 TEM Observation
The polymer solutions
used for TEM visualization were preheated at the desired temperatures
(25 and 85 °C) and placed on a carbon-coated holey film supported
by a copper grid. The grid was quenched quickly into liquid nitrogen.
Then, the frozen specimens were transferred into a vacuum freezer
drier (−20 °C) to swab off ice. Finally, the dehydrated
specimens were transferred to a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN TEM
with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

3.6 Long-Term
Thermal Stability
To avoid
the redox reaction detrimental to the viscosity of polymer solutions,41,42 the dissolved oxygen in polymer solutions should be eliminated.
N2 was first sparged into polymer solutions for 60 min
to preliminarily remove oxygen, then these samples were transferred
into a glovebox ([O2] < 0.1 ppm), and stirred for 2
h to further degas oxygen. After the dissolved oxygen was absolutely
removed, polymer solutions were put into steel containers and sealed
inside the glovebox. Finally, these steel containers were taken out
and aged in a thermostatic oil bath at 85 °C. At every consecutive
time interval, polymer solutions were taken out for viscosity measurement.

3.7 Core Flooding Test
3.7.1 Preparation
of the Core Test
The
cylindrical artificial cores were dried at 85 °C in a vacuum
oven until their weight was constant. The PV was calculated as the
ratio of the weight difference between the water-saturated core and
dry core to the brine density, and the porosity (ϕ) was the
ratio of the PV to the core volume. The brine was injected at three
different flow rates (4, 2, or 1 mL·min–1)
and the pressure drop was recorded to calculate the average value
for brine permeability (Kw) of cores.

3.7.2 Injectivity Test
When the constant
temperature was obtained, the water-saturated core was successively
injected with brine, polymer solution, and brine at a rate of 1 mL·min–1, and their stable pressure drop was recorded as (ΔP)wb, (ΔP)p, and (ΔP)wa, respectively. The
RF describes the mobility reduction, obtained by comparing the pressure
drop during polymer displacement with water flooding before polymer
injection. The RRF reflects the reduction in permeability of porous
media induced by polymer adsorption,43 determined
by the ratio of pressure difference during water flooding after polymer
injection and the corresponding pressure before polymer injection.
Effective viscosity (ηef) can provide accurate viscosity
when a polymer solution flows in porous media. RF, RRF, and ηef were defined as44 1   2   3  

Meanwhile, the material balance method44 was used to measure the dynamic adsorption of
polysaccharide and HPAM solutions. The flow rate was 1 mL·min–1 when the polymer solutions and brine were injected
into the artificial core. Throughout the experiment, water flooding
was performed to achieve a stable pressure, followed by the injected
polymer solution until the concentration of the produced fluid determined
by UV absorption analysis (UV-6100, MAPADA Instruments) was the same
or similar to the initial concentration of the polymer dope, then
follow-up water flooding was conducted until the polymer concentration
of the output fluid was close to zero. The standard curves of absorption
plotted as the relative concentration were shown in Figure S6. The relative concentration is defined as the ratio
of the concentration of the produced fluid to the initial concentration
of polymers. The dynamic retention of the polymer solution was obtained
by the followed equation45 4  where R is the density
of
polymer retention (mg·g–1), C0 is the initial concentration of polymer solution, V0 is the volume of the polymer solution, Ci and Vi denote the concentration and volume of the
output fluid, and W represents the dry weight of
the artificial core.

3.7.3 Core Flooding
When the core flooding
system was maintained at 85 °C, the crude oil was injected into
the water-saturated cores to set the initial oil saturation. Primary
water flooding was executed until no more oil was produced, then polymer
flooding was conducted by injecting 1 PV of the polymer solution,
and finally post water flooding was performed until oil production
became negligible. The incremental oil recovery by polymer solutions
and post water-flooding was used to evaluate the efficiency of these
systems. The injection rate of displacing slug was controlled at 1
mL·min–1.

4 Conclusions
The rheological behaviors, shearing stability, long-term stability,
and core flooding feasibility of the polymer solutions were comparatively
studied, and the solutions contained diutan gum, scleroglucan, xanthan
gum, and HPAM, respectively.

In the rheological measurements,
the apparent viscosity of diutan
gum and scleroglucan showed a relatively lower dependence on temperature
and salinity. Under HTHS conditions, diutan gum and scleroglucan solutions
were viscoelastic fluids while xanthan gum and HPAM were viscous fluids
within the range of the studied concentrations, and increasing concentration
of their solutions enhanced the temporary three-dimensional network.
For the long-term stability, the apparent viscosity of diutan gum
and scleroglucan solutions almost remained constant after being monitored
continuously for 90 days at 85 °C. Flow and flooding tests demonstrated
that diutan gum and scleroglucan possessed excellent mobility control
and effectively improved higher oil efficiency in porous media. Consequently,
diutan gum and scleroglucan would be excellent candidates for EOR
under HTHS conditions, potential to meet the urgent need of HTHS oil
reservoirs for salt tolerance and thermally stable polymers.
