The
effective and simple one-pot, three-component protocol for
the synthesis of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives
is presented using a triethylenediamine or imidazole Brönsted
acidic, ionic-liquid-supported Zr metal–organic framework (TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66)
as a green, novel, and retrievable heterogeneous catalyst under mild
conditions. The multicomponent reactions of 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl uracil,
various aromatic aldehydes, and acetyl acetone were conducted under
solvent-free conditions so that dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives can be obtained. It is possible to separate
and purify the respective products easily using crystallization. We
can recycle the catalysts six times without losing any major activity.
Also, the characterization of the catalyst was done by energy-dispersive
X-ray, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform
infrared, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, X-ray diffraction,
and thermogravimetric analysis analyses.

Introduction
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are very
momentous reactions and
extensively utilized in the synthesis of bioactive heterocyclic compounds.1 Moreover, MCRs pursue the green chemistry principles
and protect reagents, time, and solvents. Thus, MCRs have engrossed
much consideration for the generation of combinatorial libraries or
structural scaffolds for detection of drugs.2

Uracil derivatives have been reported to contain a diversity
of
clinical and biological attributes.3 Additionally,
pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines have gained great attention
due to the varied range of pharmacological activities, including antibacterial,4 antihypertensive,5 antitumor,6 analgesic,7 and antimicrobial.8 They can
also act as an adenosine kinase inhibitor,9 tyrosine kinase inhibitor,10 AbI kinase
inhibitor,11 and calcium channel antagonist.12

Various approaches have been reported
in the previous works for
the synthesis of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives
from aldehydes, 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, and 1,3- dimethyl uracil
condensation, such as reflux conditions13 and microwave irradiation,14 and using
a nanomagnetic catalyst (Fe3O4@SiO2–SO3H),15 AcOH,16 thiourea dioxide,17 SBA–Pr–SO3H,18 and H14[NaP5W30O110]/SiO2.19 Most of the reported procedures
need long reaction times, reagents in stoichiometric amounts, and
toxic solvents and cause low yields of the product.

Solvent-free
reaction conditions are very important since they
are efficient, clean, and cause reduction of organic solvent use.20

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
are crystalline porous compounds
constructed from metal ions and organic linkers. During recent years,
there has been ever-growing attention in characterizing and preparing
the metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) because of their high specific
surface area and pore volume and low density.21 As a consequence, MOFs have been considered as promising candidate
materials for several applications such as luminescence,22 nuclear waste partitioning, conductivity,23,24 radioactive remediation,25 removal of
toxic26,27 materials, and drug delivery.28

Lately, ionic liquids (ILs), particularly
acidic ones, have directed
growing attention toward organic synthesis since they are able to
offer an effective and green medium for organic reactions.29 Along with the application of ILs in organic
transformations, they are also employed as reaction mediators for
multicomponent reactions (MCRs).30

Organic reactions in acidic ionic liquid media have recently received
significant attention of synthetic organic chemists; ionic liquids
are environmentally friendly solvents with unique attributes such
as high thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, nonflammability,
nonvolatility, and miscibility with organic compounds, particularly
with the heterocyclic compounds. Because of these beneficial properties,
several works have been published over the last decades reporting
the possibility to accomplish numerous organic reactions and catalyzed
processes in ILs.31,32

The most significant benefit
of MOFs compared to that of other
porous materials is the easy tuning of their pore size/shapes as well
as gas affinities by altering the organic linkers and metal complexes.33 Hence, it is desirable to combine ILs and MOFs
for various applications like gas adsorption/separation and catalysis
instead of utilizing the supported IL materials or bulk ILs.

Different synthetic approaches have been recently reported for
biological products by the use of nanocatalysts.34−39

Here, we describe the synthesis of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives by a three-component condensation
reaction
of 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl uracil, aromatic aldehydes, and acetyl acetone
using a triethylenediamine or imidazole Brönsted acidic, ionic-liquid-supported
Zr metal–organic framework (TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66) as a green
and recyclable catalyst under solvent-free conditions (Figure 1 and Scheme 1).

into the micropores
of the MOF.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine Derivatives
Using BAIL@UiO-66 under Solvent-Free Conditions
Results and Discussion
In the primary
tests, BAIL@UiO-66 was prepared, and its characterization
was done by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analyses.

The stoichiometry
and the chemical purity of the samples were examined
by energy-dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) investigation. The EDAX
spectrum of UiO-66 (Figure 2a) indicates the presence of Zr, C, and O as the only basic
components of UiO-66 MOF. The EDAX spectrum of TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66
(Figure 2b,c) indicates
the elemental composition (Zr, C, O, N, and S) of micropores.

Figure 2 EDX spectra
of UiO-66 MOF (a), IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66 (b), and TEDA-BAIL@UiO-66
(C).

Field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM) is a helpful
technique for specifying the size distribution, the shape of particles,
and porosity. The particle size and the morphology of BAIL@UiO-66
MOF were specified using FE-SEM. As shown, the UiO-66 MOF and BAIL-functionalized
UiO-66 materials displayed a spherical shape (Figure 3).

Figure 3 FE-SEM images of UiO-66 (a), IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66
(b), and TEDA-BAIL@UiO-66
(c).

The FT-IR spectra of the bare
UiO-66 nanostructure and BAIL-functionalized
UiO-66 are shown in Figure 4. The two salient peaks at 1184 and 1540 cm–1 are corresponding to the symmetrical vibration and asymmetrical
vibration of COO–, respectively. It reflects the
presence of a dicarboxylate linker.40 The
Zr-O band present between the carboxylic group of terephthalic acid
and Zr(IIII) was clearly observed at 560 cm–1 in
UiO-66. The presence of new bands at around 2800–3100 cm–1 was because of aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations
and the sp2 =C–H stretching vibration of
the imidazole moiety. The peak observed at 1620 cm–1 indicates the C=N stretching vibration of the imidazole ring.
The peak that is observed at 749 cm–1 represents
the bending vibration of the imidazole ring. The peak observed at
1203 cm–1 along with a shoulder at 1400 cm–1 is assigned to the O=S=O symmetric and asymmetric
stretching states. However, the bands at 1051 cm–1 are attributed to the S–O stretching vibration.

of BAIL-functionalized UiO-66 catalysts and pure
UiO-66 MOF.

The powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns of the BAIL-functionalized
UiO-66 materials represent that approximately all of the major diffraction
peaks observed are in accordance with the pattern that was simulated
and pure UiO-66 (Figure 5). From the results, it is clearly observed that the crystalline
structure in the UiO-66 materials did not change in the BAIL functionalization
process and stayed intact. The PXRD patterns indicate the essential
peaks at around 2θ = 7.3, 8.5, 12, 14.1, 14.7, 17.4, 18.6, 19.1,
22.2, 25.6, 28.1, 30.6, 33.1, 35.6, 37.4, 40.6, 43.4, and 44.6°.
These are corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222),
(400), (331), (420), (511), (600), (533), (711), (731), (820), (751),
(664), and (933) Miller planes given in the PXRD pattern of the MOF
and simulated UiO-66,41,42 which proves that the framework
is isostructural to the prototype UiO-66 Zr-MOF.

UiO-66 catalysts and pure UiO-66
MOF.

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms were employed for studying
the specific surface area and pore volume distribution of nanostructures
UiO-66 and BAIL@UiO-66 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) approach (Figure 6). The BAIL-functionalized UiO-66 catalysts presented a considerable
reduction for the adsorbed N2 at P/P0 > 0.1 in comparison with pure UiO-66, t,
especially
the TEDA-BAIL@UiO-66 sample. The pure UiO-66 represented a BET surface
area and a total pore volume of 1871 m2 g–1 and 0.904 cm3 g–1, while IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66
and TEDA-BAIL@UiO-66 gave values of 1724 m2 g–1 and 0.892 cm3 g–1, and 1145 m2 g–1 and 0.551 cm3 g–1, respectively, as observed in Table 1. The reducing BET surface area and total pore volume
are assigned to the embodiment of BAIL groups in the UiO-66 nanocages.
Nevertheless, the high surface areas, as well as the open cavities,
were maintained benefiting the free diffusion of the product and reactant.

The BAIL-functionalized UiO-66 and UiO-66
exhibited three-stage
weight loss in the TGA curves. The first weight loss step was observed
at <150 °C and was assigned to the solvent loss from the framework.
The second weight loss step at 150–350 °C was likely because
of the decomposition of the immobilized ionic liquid moieties in the
UiO-66 nanocages. The third weight loss step at >350 °C was
assigned
to the UiO-66 framework breakdown.

According to the data, the
TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66 sample showed
higher weight loss compared to the UiO-66 sample when both were heated
up to 700 °C under Ar flow. Such behavior originates from the
addition of the decomposed from TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL from UiO-66 in the
analysis of IL-incorporated MOF sample. Tonset and Tendset temperatures were taken
from the TGA measurement, which are provided in Table 2. The bulk IL results show that the decomposition
initiates at 150 °C (specified by Tonset) and IL totally disappears before reaching the temperature of 400
°C (specified by Tendset). TGA measurements
for UiO-66 were done using the same heating rate that was used for
the bulk IL. It was observed that the decomposition of UiO-66 initiates
at a temperature of 140 °C with about 50 wt % of the initial
mass remaining in the pan following a a decrease of the slope curve
to 700 °C. On the other hand, the TEDA/IMIZ- BAIL@UiO-66 sample
showed a remaining mass of about 33 wt % of the initial mass. For
the IL loading of about 24 wt % as given by BET measurements, it can
be expected that about 26 wt % of the total mass remains in the pan
following the temperature slope to 700 °C for this sample (it
is about 50 wt % of the UiO-66 amount in the TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66
sample, since the bulk IL totally disappears at 700 °C). Nevertheless,
the TGA profile of the TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66 sample shows a remaining
mass of about 33 wt %, which is considerably less than the expected
amount. In addition, the decomposition temperature that was obtained
by this measurement was 135 °C, which is much lower than the
decomposition temperature of bulk IL and pristine UiO-66.43−45Figure 7 shows the
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of UiO-66 and BAIL@UiO-66.

In early studies, for optimization
of reaction conditions, the
reaction of 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl uracil, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, and
acetyl acetone was selected as the model reaction for the one-pot
synthesis of compound 4c. The reaction was run under
solvent-free conditions at 100 °C (Scheme 2). The optimization of the reaction conditions
was based on the solvent, catalyst, and various temperatures for the
synthesis of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines.

Scheme 2 Model Reaction for the Synthesis of Dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine 4c
Our primary investigations were conducted using several
catalysts
such as MgO, CuI, CaO, TiO2, ZnO, Cu (BDC), UiO-66, and
BAIL@UiO-66, using each catalyst (0.01 g) separately, and all of the
catalysts were investigated in the model reaction. From Figure 8, it was observed that BAIL@UiO-66
showed high activity compared with other catalysts, and the corresponding
product was 4c obtained in very good yield and short
reaction time (98% yield within 15 min) under solvent-free conditions.

Figure 8 Effect
of various catalysts on the model reaction.

Then, the model reaction was conducted using varying amounts
of
the BAIL@UiO-66 nanocomposite. The optimum amount of BAIL@UiO-66 was
0.005 g, as shown in Figure 9. When this amount was increased, no change was observed in
the reaction yield and time, while on reducing the catalyst amount,
reduction in the product yield resulted. Therefore, the best level
of BAIL@UiO-66 was chosen as 0.005 g in the model reaction (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Effect of catalyst amount
on the model reaction.

Next, we conducted the model reaction for dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine synthesis in the presence of BAIL@UiO-66 using
different solvents under solvent-free conditions at varying temperatures.
As shown in Table 3, under solvent-free conditions at 100 °C, the best outcomes
were achieved (Table 3, entry 7). A temperature increase from 120 to 140 °C in this
reaction showed no considerable impact on the product yield and time.

Some experiments were conducted,
and a number of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines were
prepared in high yields and short reaction
times. It was seen that different aryl aldehydes presented high efficiency,
giving high product yields with high purity. As observed in Table 4, aromatic aldehydes
with electron-withdrawing groups like NO2 and Cl resulted
in faster reactions compared to those with electron-donating groups
like methyl and methoxy, as anticipated. In addition, sterically hindered
aromatic aldehydes needed longer reaction times.

Then, to represent the advantages
of the present work, the catalytic
efficiency of BAIL@UiO-66 was shown in comparison with other catalysts
in the model study. As observed in Table 5, BAIL@UiO-66 showed high activity compared
with other catalysts and the corresponding product 4c generated in very good yield and short reaction time (15 min for
a 98% yield) under solvent-free conditions at a temperature of 100
°C.

Reuse of Catalyst
For investigating
the catalyst reusability,
the model reaction was conducted again using the recovered TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66
nanocomposite under the optimized reaction conditions. When the reaction
was completed (as specified by thin layer chromatography (TLC)), the
residuals were dissolved in hot ethanol or CH2Cl2 and the catalyst was filtered. The recycled catalyst can be reused
in six consecutive model reactions with no considerable activity loss
(Figure 10).

Proposed Mechanism
Scheme 3 indicates a logical mechanism for the synthesis
of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines using BAIL@UiO-66
as a catalyst. The obtained results were tested experimentally together
with the results obtained in the previous works.18,19 It is likely that BAIL@UiO-66 serves as a Brönsted acid,
increasing the carbonyl group’s electrophilicity on the acetyl
acetone and aldehyde by a strong coordinate bond. It is believed that
the first stage is the Brönsted acid-catalyzed Knoevenagel
condensation between the aldehyde (2) and acetyl acetone
(3) for producing adduct A that serves as
a Michael acceptor. The 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl uracil 1 attacks adduct A in a Michael-type way for generating
an open-chain intermediate, B. Subsequently, intramolecular
cyclization, dehydration, and aromatization on the intermediate result
in the ultimate product (4).

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism
for the Synthesis of Dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines
Conclusions
In
conclusion, a Brönsted acidic, ionic-liquid-supported
Zr metal–organic framework (BAIL@UiO-66) was successfully prepared
and used as an effective heterogeneous and green catalyst for the
synthesis of dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives
by one-pot condensation of 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl uracil, different
aromatic aldehydes, and acetyl acetone. The benefits of this approach
include clean work-up and easy reusability of the catalyst, short
reaction time, and high efficiency under solvent-free conditions.
It is expected that this approach would be extensively applied in
the combinatorial chemistry, diversity-oriented synthesis, and drug
discovery.

Experimental Section
Materials and Instrumentation
Chemical
materials were
supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and Merck and were of high purity. All of
the them were of commercial reagent grade and were utilized with no
further purification. The melting points were not corrected, and they
were specified on the capillary tube on a Boetius melting point microscope. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker
400 and 100 MHz spectrometers, using DMSO-d6 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. FT-IR
spectra were recorded on Magna-IR spectrometer 550. The elemental
analyses (C, H, N) were carried out using a Carlo ERBA model EA 1108
analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a Philips
diffractometer of X’pert Company with monochromatized Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Microscopic morphology of the
samples was visualized by SEM (LEO 1455VP). The mass spectra were
recorded on a Joel D-30 tool at an ionization potential of 70 eV.
The compositional analysis was carried out using energy-dispersive
analysis of X-ray (EDAX, Kevex, Delta Class I). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Mettler Toledo TGA under argon,
and it was heated from room temperature to 825 °C. Measurement
of nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms was carried out
at 196 °C using a Belsorp mini automatic adsorption device after
degassing the samples at 150 °C for 5 h. The approximate sample
weight was 10 mg in the TG experiment with a heating rate of 10 °C
min–1.

Preparation of UiO-66
The UiO-66
synthesis process
is illustrated in Scheme 4. It was synthesized using a solvothermal approach based on
the previous study,41 where 0.125 g of
ZrCl4 was dissolved in 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 1 mL of HCl (37%). Then, 0.123
g of terephthalic acid (H2BDC) was dissolved in 10 mL of
DMF. The solutions were mixed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and
they were heated at 80 °C for 16 h. The obtained product was
collected by centrifugation at 5600 rpm for 15 min and then rinsed
with DMF at room temperature. Then, the particles were dispersed and
rinsed with DMF for the elimination of the nonreacted H2BDC. Then, acetone and methanol were used for removal of the DMF
solvent from the product. Ultimately, the solids were dried at 80
°C overnight in a vacuum oven.

MOF
Preparation of TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL
TEDA/IMIZ-BAILs were
prepared on the basis of the approach reported in previous studies
with some changes.46 Triethylenediamine
or imidazole (0.01 mol) and 1,4-butane sultone (0.04 mol) were mixed
in toluene (40 mL) and stirred magnetically for 72 h at 80 °C.
Then, the white solid zwitterion (TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL precursor) was obtained,
filtrated, and rinsed several times with ether. A stoichiometric amount
of sulfuric acid was added to the zwitterion, and the obtained mixture
was stirred for 6 h at 80 °C to form the ionic liquids. Finally,
the BAIL phase was rinsed several times with toluene and diethyl ether
for removal of non-ionic residues, and it was dried under vacuum at
110 °C (Scheme 5).

Preparation of TEDA/IMIZ-BAIL@UiO-66
The method for
the preparation of the novel and robust Brönsted acidic, ionic-liquid-functionalized
UiO-66 MOF is shown in Scheme 6. Briefly, UiO-66 (1.0 g) was dehydrated under vacuum at 110
°C for 12 h. In a round-bottom flask, UiO-66 was suspended in
anhydrous toluene (30 mL), followed by the addition of N-heterocyclic
compounds including triethylenediamine or imidazole (5 mmol). The
reaction mixture was refluxed under stirring at 80 °C for 12
h. After reaction completion, the solvent was separated by filtration
and the excess of triethylenediamine/imidazole was removed by washing
with toluene. Next, the product was dispersed in 30 mL of anhydrous
toluene. During vigorous stirring, equivalent molar ratio 1,4-butane
sultone (5 mmol) was introduced into the solution and the mixture
was refluxed at 80 °C for 12 h. The final solid was gathered
by filtration and dried under vacuum at 110 °C for 3 h. Next,
the white solid was suspended in 20 mL of ethanol accompanied by addition
of an equivalent amount of concentrated H2SO4 (98%) drop-by-drop at 50 °C for 24 h. Finally, the catalyst
was separated by filtration and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for
12 h.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines (4a–4l)
A mixture of 6-amino-1,3-dimethyl
uracil (1 mmol), acetyl acetone
(1 mmol), aldehyde (1 mmol), and BAIL@UiO-66 (0.005 g) was heated
at 100 °C for 10–15 min. After completion of the reaction
as determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) (eluent: hexane/ethyl
acetate, 4:1), the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature
and the solid obtained was dissolved in dichloromethane; the catalyst
was insoluble in CH2Cl2 and separated by simple
filtration. The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was recrystallized
from ethanol to afford the pure product.

All of the products
were characterized and identified with mp, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FT-IR spectroscopy techniques. Spectral data of
the new products are given below.
