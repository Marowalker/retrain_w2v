The health effects
of inhaled electronic cigarette (e-cigarette)
flavoring compounds are largely unknown. Earlier reports of their
chemical reactivity have been conflicting, with some claiming, for
example, that the degradation of flavoring chemicals in e-cigarettes
to aldehydes is statistically insignificant. It is thus important
to understand how these molecules react to afford enhanced aerosol
products. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the
origin of formaldehyde, acrolein, and acetaldehyde in e-cigarettes
that contain the popular additive, triacetin (TA). By using 13C labeling and a combination of 1H NMR and 13C NMR, we were able to identify that ester hydrolysis of TA occurs
to form acetic acid (HOAc) during aerosolization. The released HOAc
acts as a catalyst in the degradation of propylene glycol (PG) and
glycerol (GLY), increasing the formation of formaldehyde hemiacetals,
acrolein, and acetaldehyde. A solution of 10% TA in 1:1 PG/GLY e-liquid
was aerosolized using two different e-cigarettes at two wattages.
Each device exhibited a significant increase in aldehyde levels, of
up to 185% compared to the aerosol from a 1:1 PG/GLY e-liquid. In
addition, the GLY formaldehyde hemiacetal was more predominant within
the presence of HOAc, indicating that GLY may be relatively more prone
to degradation from protonation.

Introduction
There are approximately
3 million adolescents using electronic
cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the United States.1 Moreover, e-cigarette usage has been reported to be a major
risk factor among youth for traditional cigarette usage.2 Flavors are well-known to be a major contributing
factor to the appeal of e-cigarettes,3,4 particularly
among young people.5,6 Among US current e-cigarette users,
82% of young people and 70% of older adults use flavored e-cigarette
liquid (e-liquid).7 The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has yet to pass federal regulation on e-liquid flavoring chemicals.8 Research is needed to better understand the identity,
levels, reactivity, and inhalation toxicology of specific flavor compounds.

E-liquid is typically composed of a mixture of carrier solvents,
nicotine, and flavoring compounds. Many flavorings are listed as generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA as food additives for ingestion.
However, their inhalation toxicity is largely unknown. Despite this,
some vaping industry websites claim that e-liquids are safe for inhalation
because of their GRAS rating.9,10

In addition to
the lack of inhalation toxicity data, the chemical
reactivity of the flavoring compounds used in e-cigarettes has also
not been extensively investigated. Previous studies have shown that
the aerosolization of flavored e-liquid increases toxic aldehyde production,11 oxidative stress,12,13 and inflammatory
responses.14,15 Khlystov and Samburova compared
the aldehyde production of flavored e-liquid to that of the aerosol
derived from carrier e-liquid [(propylene glycol (PG) and glycerol
(GLY)]. They identified a direct relationship between enhanced aldehyde
levels and flavor compound concentration.11 Others have found that different commercial e-liquid flavoring formulations
produced varying aerosol product profiles.16,17 However, to date, apart from the determination of sugar-derived
furans in e-cigarette aerosols,18 there
have been no reports focusing on how aerosol products derive from
flavoring additives. For example, it is not known if enhanced levels
of aldehydes derive directly from the flavoring molecules themselves
or if flavorings promote the degradation of other e-liquid components
such as the solvents PG/GLY. Herein, we used 13C labeling
to unambiguously determine the origin of enhanced aldehyde levels
from a relatively common e-liquid additive, triacetin (TA), the triester
of GLY (i.e., glycerin triacetate, 1,2,3-triacetoxypropane). In addition
to e-cigarette products, TA is also found in traditional cigarettes
and cigars.19

TA is mainly used to
enhance the overall flavor of the e-cigarette
aerosol. It has become popular in the “do-it-yourself”
community because of its ability to lessen the “bite”.20 Manufactures are not required to report TA’s
presence or levels in e-liquids, so its abundance in e-liquids is
largely unknown. However, we found three manufacturer websites that
do report TA (Table 1, see also Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Importantly, some companies have also begun to use it as a replacement
solvent for PG.21

Results and Discussion
Determination of the Aerosol Product Profiles
The two
e-cigarette devices EC1 and EC2 were chosen to represent different
coil options, namely, a sub-Ohm vertical coil (EC1) and a horizontal
coil (EC2).22 Each was tested at two battery
power settings that were chosen from self-described user preferences
(Supporting Information) that were also
within the manufacturers’ recommended ranges. In order to determine
the origin of aldehyde aerosol products from the TA-containing e-liquid,
we synthesized 13C-labeled TA from the reaction of GLY
and acetic anhydride. Compound 4 (Figure 1) was derived from 13C-labeled
GLY and compound 5 (Figure 1) from 13C-labeled acetic anhydride.
The use of 13C-labeled TA molecules allowed us to determine
whether TA forms aldehydes directly via its thermal decomposition
(Scheme 1), or if TA
plays a different role.

Figure 1 Isotopically labeled TA. TA derived from isotopically
labeled GLY
(4) and from isotopically labeled acetic anhydride (5).

Scheme 1 Two Pathways of TA-Proposed
Thermal Degradation
TA forms acrolein, acetaldehyde,
and formaldehyde. In e-cigarettes, formaldehyde further reacts with
PG/GLY to form formaldehyde hemiacetals.23,26

TA has been reported23 to degrade under
thermal conditions to form acetic acid (HOAc), formaldehyde, acrolein
(2), and acetaldehyde (3), as shown in Scheme 1. The IARC (International
Agency for Research on Cancer) reports formaldehyde as a known carcinogen
and acetaldehyde as a possible carcinogen.24 Acrolein is a notorious air pollutant. It has been shown to cause
a decrease in respiratory rates and to cause intense eye and respiratory
irritation in humans. It has been shown to lead to inflammation, obstruction
of the trachea and bronchi, and hemorrhaging in animals.25 Previously, 1–3 have been
identified in the aerosol of e-cigarettes from the dehydration and
oxidation of the e-liquid solvents.26

On the basis of the literature precedent,11,23 we anticipated an enhanced level of aldehyde byproducts in the aerosol
derived from the flavored (i.e., TA-containing) e-liquid as compared
to the aerosol from the e-liquid composed of PG/GLY alone. Indeed,
an overlay of the 1H NMR spectra (Figure 2) of the aerosol derived from each type of
e-liquid clearly shows that the aerosol derived from the TA/PG/GLY
e-liquid contained higher levels of aldehydes 1a–b (as the formaldehyde hemiacetals),27 as
well as 2 (acrolein) and 3 (acetaldehyde).

Figure 2 Overlay
of the 1H NMR spectra of aerosolized (red) PG/GLY
e-liquid and (blue) 10% TA/PG/GLY e-liquid. The peaks of interest
that increase in height are identified by the doublet at 9.55 ppm
as the aldehyde resonance of acrolein, the multiplet at 6.35 ppm as
the trans β hydrogen, doublet at 6.47 ppm as the cis β
hydrogen, and doublet at 6.625 ppm as the α hydrogen resonance
of acrolein; the quartet at 9.65 ppm as the aldehyde resonance of
acetaldehyde; and last, the overlapping triplets at 6.20 and 6.17
ppm as the hydroxyl resonance of the primary formaldehyde hemiacetals
corresponding to PG and GLY, respectively. Chemical peak identification
by the addition of authentic standards was performed extensively and
published in our previous work.26 These
spectra were obtained using EC2 at 11 W.

The aerosol levels of 1a–3 were quantified
by 1H NMR, using the internal standard 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-nitrobenzene.
Concentrations were normalized by dividing by the mass of e-liquid
consumed (Supporting Information). The
peaks corresponding to compounds 1a–b were integrated
together because of their overlapping peaks. In EC1 (sub-Ohm), compounds 1a–b were the only detectable target products by 1H NMR from aerosolized PG/GLY (Figure 3). However, the addition of 10% TA afforded
80–162% increases in 1a–b, as well as a
detectable level of 2 in the aerosol. The relatively
large error bars observed for the EC1 results are due to the fact
that the relatively low levels of aldehydes produced were close to
the limit of detection of the NMR technique. Although sub-Ohm devices
typically produce lower concentrations of aerosol aldehyde products,
they typically deliver much greater relative levels of PG and GLY
to the user.28 The EC2 device thus produced
orders of magnitude greater levels of 1a–3 (at
11 W) as compared to EC1 (no TA added). The inclusion of 10% TA in
the EC2 e-liquid led to product increases of 185, 149, and 173%. Using
EC2 at 9 W, aerosolized PG/GLY alone afforded no detectable levels
of 1a–3. However, the addition of 10% TA afforded 1a–b, 2, and 3 in measurable
amounts of 0.09, 0.004, and 0.003 mg/g, respectively. Thus, in the
case of each e-cigarette, the e-liquids containing 10% TA exhibited
a clear trend of enhanced relative levels of aldehydes compared to
those containing only PG/GLY.

Figure 3 Concentrations of compounds 1a–3 in the aerosolization
of PG/GLY and increased levels with the addition of 10% TA. The blue
bar represents the amount of product (mg solute/g solution consumed)
formed from aerosolized PG/GLY e-liquid. The green bar represents
the amount of products formed from aerosolized TA/PG/GLY e-liquid.
The inset displays the results from EC2 at 9 W, expanded by 100 times. 1a, 1b, 2, and 3 represent
PG formaldehyde hemiacetal, GLY formaldehyde hemiacetal, acrolein,
and acetaldehyde, respectively. Errors bars were calculated by one
standard deviation. The enhanced concentration of 1a–3 was significant under all conditions except in the case of 1a–b generated by EC1 at 55 W (see the Supporting Information).

Origin of the Enhanced Product Formation
In order to
best inform manufactures, regulatory agencies, and users of potential
health risks, it is imperative to determine the sources of increased
levels of 1–3. Aerosols derived from PG/GLY containing
either 10% 13C3-TA (4) or 10% 13C6-TA (5) e-liquids were analyzed
by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The 13C NMR
of the 10% 13C6-TA (5, acetate-labeled)
aerosol displays a prominent peak at 172 ppm corresponding to the
carbonyl peak of acetic acid. Importantly, this was the only 13C-labeled product observed, and it was not detectable in
the 10% 13C3-TA-derived aerosol (4) spectrum. This indicates that ester hydrolysis of TA occurs to
form HOAc during aerosolization. The formation of HOAc has the lowest
energy barrier of the initial steps in the pyrolysis pathways of TA.23,29

Importantly, the degradation of PG and GLY is well-known to
be catalyzed by acid and can lead to increased levels of 1–3.30,31 Therefore, we can conclude that TA promotes
aldehyde formation in e-cigarettes by producing HOAc that serves as
a catalyst to enhance PG and GLY reactivity (Scheme 2). This was confirmed by analyzing the aerosol
derived from a control e-liquid consisting of a 1:1 PG/GLY solution
containing 0.5% HOAc, the level of HOAc produced in the experiments
using the acetate-labeled TA, 5. Figure 4 reveals that the 1a–3 aerosol spectrum derived from the HOAc/PG/GLY e-liquid exhibits
enhanced 1a–3 levels, as is consistent with the
findings from the TA/PG/GLY e-liquid (Figure 2).

Figure 4 Overlay of 1H NMR spectra of aerosolized
(red) PG/GLY
e-liquid and (blue) 0.5% HOAc/PG/GLY e-liquid. The triplet at 6.20
ppm was identified as 1a. The triplet at 6.17 was identified
as 1b. The doublet at 9.55 ppm, multiplet at 6.35 ppm,
doublet at 6.47 ppm, and doublet at 6.625 ppm were identified as 2. The quartet at 9.65 ppm was identified as 3. In the presence of HOAc there is a visible increase in peaks corresponding
to 1a–3. These spectra were obtained using EC2
at 11 W.

Scheme 2 TA in E-Cigarettes Leads to HOAc Formation
and Subsequent Protonation
of PG/GLY To Catalyze the Formation of Products Such as 1–3
This was confirmed via the use
of 13C-labeled TA as the predominant pathway observed under
the conditions used herein.

Finally, we found
that the presence of HOAc leads to greater production
of the GLY-derived formaldehyde hemiacetal 1b as compared
to the PG formaldehyde hemiacetal 1a (Figure 4). Protonation of GLY has been
reported to significantly lower the activation energy of its dehydration
from 65–71 to 20–25 kcal mol–1. These
results indicate that e-liquids containing TA and higher GLY/PG ratios
may be relatively more prone to the enhanced production of formaldehyde
and related products.

Conclusions
Herein, we have shown
that the addition of TA to PG/GLY e-liquid
affords higher levels of formaldehyde hemiacetals (1a–b), acrolein (2), and acetaldehyde (3) by
releasing HOAc. This occurs via HOAc formation from TA, followed by
acid catalysis of PG/GLY degradation. Although TA may be a direct
source of aldehydes, we did not observe this under the conditions
herein. One limitation of this study includes not quantifying gaseous
formaldehyde because of the method of collection and analysis. However,
our previous research has shown that an increase in 1a–b concentration is proportional to an increase in gaseous formaldehyde
(1) production.32 Further
related investigations involving additional e-liquid formulations
are currently under study in our labs.

Methods
Electronic
Cigarette Devices
Two devices were used
for aerosolization.

EC1
A SMOK Alien 220 W variable
voltage/variable wattage/temperature
control (VV/VW/TC) battery was fitted with a SMOK Baby containing
a Q2 0.4 Ω single vertical coil.

EC2
A SMOK Alien
220W VV/VW/TC battery was fitted with
a Kanger Protank 2 Clearomizer containing a MT32 2.2 Ω single
horizontal coil.

Synthesis of 13C-Labeled TA
13C3-GLY (Sigma-Aldrich) was converted to
C6-13C3H14O6 (13C3-TA, 4) by acetic anhydride
and pyridine (25
°C, 22 h). Purification was performed by column chromatography,
followed by solvent evaporation under reduced pressure to afford the
liquid product. Purity was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. GLY was converted to C3-13C6H14O6 (13C6-TA, 5) by 13C4 acetic anhydride (Cambridge
Isotopes) and pyridine (25 °C, 22 h). Purification was performed
by column chromatography, followed by solvent evaporation under reduced
pressure to afford the liquid product. Purity was confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR.

E-Liquid Preparation and
Avoidance of Dry Coils and Burnt E-Liquid
Each device was
filled with e-liquid to the highest level according
to the manufacturers’ recommendation.

PG/GLY Solution
A 1:1 ratio (by volume, v/v %) of PG/GLY
was mixed in-house from ACS-grade PG and GLY. EC1 and EC2 were filled
with a mixture of 1.0 mL PG and 1.0 mL GLY, respectively.

10% TA Solution
A 1:1 ratio of PG/GLY (v/v %) was mixed
in-house with an addition of 10% (v/v %) ACS-grade TA.

10% 13C3-TA (4) Solution
A 1:1
ratio of PG/GLY (v/v %) was mixed in-house with an addition
of 10% (v/v %) synthesized 4.

10% 13C6-TA (5) Solution
A 1:1 ratio of PG/GLY
(v/v %) was mixed in-house with an addition
of 10% (v/v %) synthesized 5.

Throughout each vaping
session, ample e-liquid was maintained to cover the wicking material.
After each session, the e-liquid was replaced with a fresh solution.
New coils were also used in each session. Each device was studied
at two wattages that were within self-reported user preferences (Supporting Information) as well as within the
range of the manufacturers’ recommendation.

Collecting
the Aerosol
The e-cigarette aerosol consists
of liquid particles suspended in the gas phase.33 The aerosol produced was passed through a dry cold trap
submerged in a dry ice/acetone bath (−76 °C ± 2 °C),
followed by an impinger of 0.6 mL DMSO-d6 connected to a CH Technologies single cigarette smoking machine
(SCSM-STEP). Each vaping session consisted of 10 puffs. The SCSM-STEP
was set to the CORESTA program, which has a square shape puff profile,
a 3 s puff period, and a 55 mL puff volume. In this study, the puff
interval was set to 1 min to aid cooling of the heating coils between
puffs. EC1 was tested in triplicate at 55 and 65 W. EC2 was tested
in triplicate at 9 and 11 W. The aerosolization of 13C3-TA (4) e-liquid and 13C6-TA (5) e-liquid was each performed once with EC1 at
65 W and once with EC2 at 11 W. After each puff, DMSO-d6 from the impinger was used to collect the aerosols that
had condensed inside the cold trap. The dissolved aerosol (0.425 mL)
was placed in a Wilmad 400 MHz NMR tube. An internal standard was
added via a 40 μL aliquot of a 10.01 mM 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-nitrobenzene
solution in DMSO-d6.

Analysis by
NMR
NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker
400 MHz AVANCE II+ spectrometer.

1H NMR
1H
NMR spectra were obtained
using a 30° pulse angle, 10 s relaxation delay, and 256 acquisitions.

13C NMR
Using a 30° pulse angle, 2
s relaxation delay, and 2048 acquisitions, 13C NMR spectra
were obtained for the sample of (i) 10% 13C3-TA (4) solution, (ii) 10% 13C6-TA (5) solution, and (iii) 10% TA solution for EC1
at 65 W and for EC2 at 11 W. Data were processed and analyzed using
the software, MNova.
