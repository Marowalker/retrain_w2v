Several
research groups have observed magnetism in monolayer-protected
gold cluster samples, but the results were often contradictory, and
thus, a clear understanding of this phenomenon is still missing. We
used Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)180, which is a paramagnetic
cluster that can be prepared with atomic precision and whose structure
is known precisely. Previous magnetometry studies only detected paramagnetism.
We used samples representing a range of crystallographic orders and
studied their magnetic behaviors using electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR). As a film, Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)180 exhibits a paramagnetic
behavior, but at low temperature, ferromagnetic interactions are detectable.
One or few single crystals undergo physical reorientation with the
applied field and exhibit ferromagnetism, as detected through hysteresis
experiments. A large collection of microcrystals is magnetic even
at room temperature and shows distinct paramagnetic, superparamagnetic,
and ferromagnetic behaviors. Simulation of the EPR spectra shows that
both spin−orbit (SO) coupling and crystal distortion are important
to determine the observed magnetic behaviors. Density functional theory
calculations carried out on single cluster and periodic models predict
the values of SO coupling and crystal-splitting effects in agreement
with the EPR-derived quantities. Magnetism in gold nanoclusters is
thus demonstrated to be the outcome of a very delicate balance of
factors. To obtain reproducible results, the samples must be (i) controlled
for composition and thus be monodisperse with atomic precision, (ii)
of known charge state, and (iii) well-defined in terms of crystallinity
and experimental conditions.

Introduction
Gold nanoparticles
and nanoclusters exhibit distinct optical, electrochemical,
charge-transfer, and catalytic properties.1−6 These properties are particularly distinctive in monolayer-protected
clusters (MPCs), that is, small metal structures stabilized by a molecular
layer. Over the past years, knowledge of the properties of most MPCs
has expanded very significantly. However, an important property still
poorly understood is the nanomagnetism of gold, despite the magnetic
nanoparticles and nanoclusters being of intrinsic importance and promising
value in data storage, spintronics, quantum computing, optomagnetic
devices, biomedical applications, and nanocatalysis.7−12

Although bulk gold is known to be a typical diamagnetic material,
upon decreasing the size down to the nanoscale a magnetic moment appears.7−9 Since the first report by Hori et al.,13 several papers described magnetic properties of gold nanoparticles,
mostly thiolate MPCs prepared according to the two-phase synthesis
by Brust et al.,14 but the contradictory
outcome of several of these results has been pointed out, reviewed,
and discussed.7−9 The observed magnetic behavior can indeed be very
different. For example, Crespo et al.15 and Donnio et al.16 observed ferromagnetism
in MPCs with diameters of 1.8–2.1 nm, whereas Yamamoto and
Hori used clusters with a mean diameter of 1.9 nm and detected both
superparamagnetism and Pauli paramagnetism.17 Pauli paramagnetism, but no ferro- or superparamagnetism, was observed
by Lear and his co-workers on nanoparticles of 1.8–1.9 nm.18−20 Gréget et al. concluded that 1.9 nm large MPCs were diamagnetic,
whereas larger particles (4.4 nm) were ferromagnetic.21 Although ferromagnetism is generally detected when the
MPC size decreases, Muñoz-Márquez et al. observed ferromagnetism
in 2.1 nm clusters and diamagnetism in smaller clusters (1.4 nm).22 It has also been observed that, depending on
ligands, ∼2 nm clusters may exhibit ferromagnetism, paramagnetism,
and diamagnetism.23 Ferromagnetic behavior
was observed for both films formed of bare Au clusters24 and Au nanoparticles embedded in films of titania.11 This astonishing variability in behavior is
worsened by the observation that even particles of the same batch
may exhibit very different magnetizations. Sometimes, different magnetic
behaviors were observed even for samples prepared by using the same
synthetic procedures and even by the same group.9 In addition to these confusing results, some intriguing
magnetic phenomena were also observed, such as an unusual dependence
of the magnetization on temperature and dimensions of the particles
and a very high magnetic anisotropy.16,25,26 Recent compilations of the different magnetic results
obtained for Au nanoparticles or nanocluster systems, mostly ranging
from 1 to 4 nm, are available.24,27 From a theoretical
viewpoint, magnetism of gold has been related to a surface effect
with an important orbital contribution to the magnetic moment.28,29

Nealon et al. discussed all of these topics in particular
detail,
and their analysis converged to the quite disappointing but nonetheless
thought-provoking conclusion that nobody really knows to what extent
and why some MPCs exhibit an intrinsic magnetism.9 Because the experimental results are often strange, discordant,
and rarely reproducible, it is not surprising if a general explanation
and even a qualitative understanding of these findings are still missing.
We believe that this variegated, intriguing, and also confusing scenario
is primarily due to the lack of control of the composition, structure,
charge state, and, as we will show here, crystallinity and morphology
of MPCs. Indeed, with very few exceptions to be discussed later, the
majority of measurements were carried out on Au nanoparticles lacking
atomic precision (and thus possessing only an average dimension assessed
through transmission electron microscopy images) and of undetermined
charge state. Both of these properties are closely linked to the magnetism
of materials: by changing the dimension and the charge state, it is
indeed possible to switch between different forms of magnetism. For
example, the redox steps associated with charging of MPCs of hundreds
of Au atoms can be so closely spaced3,30 that removing
or adding electrons can be easily triggered by oxygen or a mild reductant
and via intercluster disproportionation–comproportionation
equilibria. Depending on the experimental conditions and material
preparation, different magnetic states are thus possible. If the cluster
stoichiometry is not controlled, further uncertainty will be obviously
introduced, as this increases very significantly the number of available
redox couples in the whole sample.

MPCs with a gold core size
of less than 1.5 nm exhibit the same
general features of molecules.1−3,30 Importantly,
most molecular MPCs can be prepared in a truly atomically monodisperse
form.1,2 The most well-known and understood example
of them is Au25(SR)18.31 Its structure is formed of a 13-gold-atom icosahedral core stabilized
by six -(SR)-Au-(SR)-Au-(SR)- units (SR = thiolate).32,33 Whereas anion Au25(SR)18– and cation Au25(SR)18+ are diamagnetic,
the neutral form Au25(SR)180 is paramagnetic.34−36 For this charge
state, which can be defined very precisely through electrochemistry
or controlled redox reactions,33,37,38 room temperature NMR spectroscopy shows that the spin density spreads
onto the first ligand atoms and causes the corresponding resonances
to undergo significant chemical shifts relative to the anionic or
cationic diamagnetic state.35 Continuous-wave
electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) experiments on frozen, glassy
solutions show a broad peak detectable at temperatures lower than
100 K and exhibiting the typical features of a doublet state.34,36 To complete the solution-phase magnetic picture, low-temperature
electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) assessed the interactions
of the unpaired electron with both gold39 and hydrogen nuclei.40 On the other hand,
the knowledge of the magnetism of Au25(SR)180 in the solid
state, that is, the physical state that most other gold magnetism
data refer to, is far less advanced. According to superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry studies, Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)180 (hereafter, we will indicate phenylethanethiolate
simply as SC2Ph) is as paramagnetic in the solid state27,34,41 as in the frozen solution.33,35 It is worth noting that the nature of the capping ligand cannot
be ignored. We have recently shown that by using n-butanethiolate ligands the resulting crystals are formed of a linear
sequence of Au25(SBu)180 clusters interconnected by Au–Au bonds:
overlap of the singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) of neighboring
clusters allows coupling the individual spins with the formation of
an antiferromagnetic polymer, as revealed by EPR spectroscopy.42 This result shows that possible interactions
between paramagnets in the solid state should always be taken into
consideration and also be understood in terms of the crystallographic
structure.

In this work, we describe the magnetic behavior of
Au25(SC2Ph)180 in
different solid-state forms, as assessed by EPR spectroscopy. In this
connection, it is worth noting that SQUID has been the technique of
choice for most of the previously quoted studies on molecular and
nonmolecular or nonatomically precise Au nanoparticles. This method
allows the detection of the susceptibility of the entire sample, which
may be the result of different magnetic contributions (ferromagnetic,
paramagnetic, diamagnetic, etc.). In EPR, on the other hand, only
unpaired electrons are observed, and therefore, the diamagnetic contribution,
which may be very significant, is completely removed. Moreover, different
contributions to the overall magnetization can be often separated:
for instance, ferromagnetic signals can be easily distinguished from
most paramagnetic signals because they are characterized by completely
different line shape and temperature dependencies. In the past, consistent
EPR studies have been carried out to study both molecular Au25(SR)18 or Au25(SR)18 doped with
Pt, Pd, or Hg and larger nonmolecular Au nanoparticles.19,20,34,36,39,42−45 It was also employed for studying the magnetism of gold nanorods
and nanoparticles, which showed ferromagnetic signals.46,47 The potential of the EPR approach has been evidenced particularly
well through the observation of size-dependent signals for gold nanorods.46 In most cases, on the other hand, analogous
samples were found to be EPR-silent or showed very weak and hardly
interpretable signals.22,48 Our study takes advantage of
using a cluster, Au25(SC2Ph)180, whose structure in the neutral state
has been refined very recently49 and whose
magnetic properties in solution are well-understood. The interactions
between Au25(SC2Ph)180 clusters in the solid state were studied by
using a combination of experimental and theoretical analyses. By carrying
out a comparative study of the magnetic behavior of samples endowed
of different morphology and crystallinity, we could detect and rationalize,
for the first time, a series of magnetic behaviors. Independent EPR
and density functional theory (DFT) calculations concur in pointing
to the importance of spin−orbit (SO) coupling effects to explain
the observed phenomena.

Results and Discussion
Au25(SC2Ph)180 was
prepared by the oxidation of the diamagnetic
anion Au25(SC2Ph)18–. By using
methodologies that we devised and described previously, oxidation
was carried out either chromatographically50 or electrochemically.49 Each sample was
meant to provide a specific example of different crystalline order
and physical state: frozen solution, film, single crystal, immobilized
single crystal, collection of 10 crystals, immobilized collection
of 10 crystals, and microcrystals. Figure S1 shows images of these samples.

Film
The Au25(SC2Ph)180 film was prepared
inside of
the EPR tube by evaporation of the solvent from a dichloromethane
solution. The film corresponds to a virtually amorphous solid and
thus represents the lowest crystalline degree of the solid samples
investigated herein. Figure 1 shows the EPR spectra (in black) obtained at temperatures
ranging from 5 to 160 K, together with the corresponding simulations
(in red). To evidence better the weak signals observed at temperatures
larger than 60 K, the data in Figure 1a have been multiplied by a factor of 10.

Figure 1 Experimental
(black) and calculated (red) cw-EPR spectra of an
Au25(SC2Ph)180 amorphous film at different temperatures (K), as indicated.
In (a), the data were multiplied by a factor of 10 with respect to
those in (b). In (b), the blue trace corresponds to the EPR cavity
at 5 K.

Each spectrum consists of a quite
broad anisotropic line that can
be well-simulated by considering an ensemble of randomly oriented
paramagnetic clusters with S = 1/2 and a Zeeman interaction
described by an orthorhombic g-tensor with principal
values (at low temperatures) of 2.53 (x), 2.36 (y), and 1.82 (z); these values are very
similar to those previously described for Au25(SC2Ph)180 in frozen solutions
at similar temperatures, that is, 2.56, 2.36, and 1.82, respectively.34,36Figure 1 shows that
an increase in temperature has the main effect of diminishing the
intensity of the signal, which becomes barely detectable for temperatures
larger than 160 K. This decrease is qualitatively similar to that
already observed for the same cluster in the frozen solution.36 The main difference between these two cases
(Figure S2 shows a direct comparison of
the two spectra at 10 K) is that inhomogeneous broadening is more
severe in the film than that in the frozen solution. Indeed, the spectrum
of the film could be simulated only by including some distribution
for the y and z components of the g-tensor, which correspond to the two negative peaks at
3000–4000 G; for 5 K, we used fwhm (full width at half-maximum)
values of 0.28 (gy) and
0.15 (gz) for y and z, respectively, whereas even larger
fwhm values were used for higher temperatures. This distribution suggests
the presence of weak orientation-dependent interactions in the film.

Insights into this aspect can be obtained from the temperature
dependence of the magnetic susceptibility (χm). For
an ensemble of perfect, noninteracting paramagnets, χm is inversely proportional to the temperature, as described by the
Curie law (eq 1) 1  where the Curie constant C is composed of the number
of spins N, the Bohr
magneton μB, the Landé factor gL, the quantum number of the total magnetic moment J, and the Boltzmann constant kB. The EPR signal can be integrated to obtain the corresponding EPR
absorption spectrum, and further integration yields the so-called
double-integrated EPR intensity (IEPR);
details about these integrations are provided in the Supporting Information. IEPR is
proportional to χm, and therefore, as long as the
Curie law is obeyed, a plot of IEPR–1 versus T should be linear.

The best example of noninteracting paramagnetic MPCs is provided
by clusters in a diluted frozen solution. Analysis of the data for
2 mM Au25(SC2Ph)180 in frozen dichloromethane36 shows that in the experimentally accessible temperature
range (6–80 K), a plot of IEPR–1 versus T is indeed quite linear
(r2 = 0.997), as shown in Figure S3. In fact, the observation of a nonzero
intercept at 4(1) K suggests that this system could be better described
by the Curie–Weiss law (eq 2) 2  where TC is the
intercept or Curie temperature, which marks the onset of magnetic
interactions between the paramagnets. Although this TC value is indeed very close to zero, we note that even
at 2 mM concentration in a frozen solution the distance between the
individual clusters is not particularly large: Au25(SC2Ph)180 has a radius
of 13.2 Å36 and a core radius of 4.9
Å,32 and therefore, the mean Au-core
edge-to-edge intercluster distance is 8.4 nm, whereas the mean Au-core
edge-to-edge distance between the nearest neighbors51 is only 4.2 nm. At this distance, a nonzero exchange coupling
between the spins of neighboring clusters cannot be completely excluded.

Figure 2 shows the IEPR–1 versus T plot for the film. Interestingly, whereas in the high temperature
range the plot is quite linear (r2 = 0.987),
a net deviation from linearity occurs for T <
80 K, with an intercept of 63(4) K. This deviation is attributed to
a weak ferromagnetic interaction between the spins of the individual
clusters. The not-so-small intercept value is thus in keeping with
a non-Curie behavior caused by partial parallel alignment of the spins,
as described by eq 2.
This shows that some interactions are clearly detectable in the solid
state, despite the structurally disordered film sample. This is indeed
reasonable because the mean Au-core edge-to-edge intercluster distance
in Au25(SC2Ph)18 films can be bracketed between
1 and 2 nm.36,49,52

of temperature. The solid line is the linear regression of the data
(black square) at the higher temperatures.

Single Crystals
A perfectly crystalline sample features
the opposite case of an amorphous film. We used one single crystal
obtained by the electrocrystallization of Au25(SC2Ph)180.49Figure 3 shows that the spectrum consists of a narrow signal centered at
about 2500 G. As the temperature increases, the signal becomes weaker
and virtually disappears for T > 35 K. The monocrystal
signal (peaks at 2460–2630 G) and its temperature dependence
are thus very different from those described for the amorphous film
(peaks at 2700–3800 G).

Figure 3 Effect of temperature (K) on the cw-EPR
spectra of one single crystal
of Au25(SC2Ph)180.

A single crystal of interacting paramagnets should be anisotropic,
and therefore, one would expect to observe relevant spectral changes
in both line shape and position upon rotation of the EPR tube with
respect to the direction of the applied magnetic field. We recorded
a series of EPR spectra after progressively rotating the tube by 90°,
and the results are shown in Figure 4a. Surprisingly, however, the spectrum did not change.
A simple explanation for having an isotropic system is highly unlikely
because the principal g-tensor values optimized for
the film and frozen solution EPR spectra already evidenced a high
degree of anisotropy. We suspected that the observed apparent isotropic behavior was caused by a physical reorientation of the
crystal inside of the tube, as expected for a ferromagnetic crystal
that would minimize its magnetic energy by aligning its anisotropy
axis along the direction of the applied field, with the result of
observing the same spectrum at each orientation. The spectrum at 5
K could be simulated by two Lorentzian lines with g factors of 2.79 and 2.70, which can be attributed to bulk and surface
magnetization, respectively; this difference is due to magnetic surface
anisotropy (Figure S4).53 Differently from the film and the frozen solution, the
single-crystal signals are characterized by a single g value corresponding to one definite direction. Figure S4 also shows the unsuccessful simulations carried
out by assuming either of the above g factors.

Figure 4 Orientation
dependence of the cw-EPR spectra of one single crystal
of Au25(SC2Ph)180 uncovered (a) or covered (b) by frozen MeCN.
Within each graph, the EPR tube was rotated by 0 (blue), 90 (red),
and 180° (black) (T = 5 K).

To confirm this hypothesis, we put one single crystal of
a similar
size in an EPR tube and then added acetonitrile, a solvent in which
the cluster is insoluble. Upon cooling, MeCN freezes and blocks the
crystal from possible field-induced reorientations of the crystal.
As clearly shown in Figure 4b, the spectrum recorded upon a 90° rotation is completely
different from the original spectrum (or, similarly, that obtained
upon a 180° rotation), in full agreement with our hypothesis.
The difference between the initial states of the two samples is attributed
to the way by which the crystal gets immobilized by the frozen solvent
in comparison with the free crystal, which can optimize its position
with respect to the direction of the applied field.

To test
the hypothesis of ferromagnetism, we carried out EPR hysteresis
experiments. A typical experiment consisted of an upward scan (from
low to high fields) followed by a backward scan carried out after
a time long enough (in this specific case, 30 min) for the system
to reach equilibrium; this procedure makes the upward and downward
scans determined by the situations attained at low or high field,
respectively. The experiment also included a third upward scan (again,
after a 30 min rest period) to check whether the first scan could
be reproduced precisely: this was always verified. Differences between
the upward and backward spectra are caused by the magnetization of
the sample at high field value and provide an important indication
of ferromagnetism.

The hysteresis experiments showed that an
effect is perceivable
for T < 10 K. This effect is particularly evident
at 5 K (Figure 5),
at which the low-field signals in the upward and downward spectra
are substantially different in both intensity and line shape; as aforementioned,
the first and the last upward scans are overlapping. The corresponding,
though much less pronounced, hysteresis behavior at 10 K is provided
in Figure S5. These temperatures point
to an apparent (see below) anisotropy energy on the order of 0.4–0.8
meV. No evident hysteresis, on the other hand, was detectable for
the single crystal immobilized in frozen MeCN, whether by optimizing
the orientation of the sample or after rotation by 90° (Figure S6). This behavior can be rationalized
by considering that whereas the free single crystal can modify its
orientation and thus optimize the alignment of its anisotropy axis
with the applied field (which maximizes hysteresis), in the second
experiment the single crystal is blocked in a random orientation,
and therefore, any hysteresis effect is significantly reduced.

Figure 5 Hysteresis
cw-EPR experiment for a Au25(SC2Ph)180 single crystal
at 5 K. The direction and trace color of the three scans are indicated.

The effect of increasing the complexity
of the experimental system
was studied by using a collection of 10 single crystals with dimensions
comparable to those of the previous samples. Indeed, the presence
of more than one crystal modifies the spectrum quite significantly,
as shown in Figure S7. The same is true
for a similar group of crystals trapped in frozen MeCN (Figure S8). As observed for the isolated single
crystals, the hysteresis experiments (Figures S9 and S10) show that differences between the upward and downward
traces are evident for the free crystals but not for the MeCN frozen
sample.

Comparison of the results obtained for the solid samples
clearly
shows that when the paramagnetic Au25(SC2Ph)180 clusters are
in the crystalline state, the spins of the single clusters are no
more independent. The observed effects on the EPR spectrum are due
to a cooperative ferromagnetic ordering. These results and comparisons,
including the behavior of the film, thus provide compelling evidence
for the onset of ferromagnetic behavior and show that the magnetic
properties are very sensitive to the crystallinity and the physical
state of the sample.

Microcrystals
We then studied a
sample consisting of
a very large ensemble of much smaller crystals, which will be denoted
as microcrystals. This was meant to provide a sample that is more
similar to those typically used in SQUID measurements. The EPR spectra
were recorded in a particularly wide temperature range (Figure 6), also because the temperature
dependence of the spectral pattern proved to be quite complex.

Figure 6 Effect of temperature
(K) on the cw-EPR spectra of an Au25(SC2Ph)180 collection
of microcrystals.

For temperatures decreasing
from 100 K, the signal initially broadens
and shifts to lower fields. This behavior is attributed to the onset
of superparamagnetism, which is typical for small magnetically ordered
particles.54−57 In these systems, the exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropy
generate a strong temperature-dependent inner field that adds to the
applied external field. For uniaxial symmetry, the two opposite directions
of the anisotropy axis correspond to the two minima of the anisotropy
energy (Ean), which is the energy barrier
to invert the direction of the magnetization. When kBT > Ean,
the temperature is high enough for the magnetization to reverse its
direction. This superparamagnetic behavior is somewhat similar to
paramagnetism, but the coupled spins give rise to higher magnetization.
For kBT < Ean, on the other hand, this magnetization flipping
is hampered and the system becomes ferromagnetic; hysteresis is then
usually observed, as it will be discussed in detail below. In addition
to the superparamagnetic/ferromagnetic signal, the familiar paramagnetic
signal becomes perceivable starting from 40 K, at approximately 2750
G, and its intensity progressively increases as the temperature decreases,
as already observed for the film and the frozen solution. It is finally
worth mentioning that for T > 100 K the superparamagnetic
signal is still present but exhibits the peculiar behavior of initially
shifting to lower fields and then, for T > 200
K,
to higher fields. This behavior is probably associated with the thermal
population of higher energy spin states. In the following, however,
we will specifically focus on the results obtained in a temperature
range comparable to that explored for the other samples.

Figure 7 shows the
outcome of the hysteresis experiments. At each temperature, we carried
out the same sequence of three scans explained in the previous section.
The third scan was always found to overlap precisely with the first
scan and thus is not shown for clarity. As the temperature progressively
decreases from 40 K (Figure 7a), the signals observed at 2000–2700 G for the upward
and downward scans are substantially different. The main effect is
that in the downward spectra the signal is stronger and slightly shifted
to higher fields. The hysteresis experiments thus show that the microcrystals
exhibit a ferromagnetic behavior. Interestingly, hysteresis is observed
at a higher temperature than for the large crystals. The magnetic
anisotropy energy Ean of the microcrystal
sample can be estimated on the order of approximately 3 meV, which
is about 1 order of magnitude larger than the energy value observed
for the single crystal. Indeed, this result would be quite unusual
because both the magnetocrystalline and magnetostatic anisotropy contributions
to the overall magnetic anisotropy are expected to decrease as the
size decreases.58 However, whereas for
microcrystals we are dealing mostly with single-domain particles with
uniform magnetization, for the much larger single crystal the magnetization
is not uniform and the form of the anisotropy energy is conceivably
more complex, with several local minima.59 Indeed, the observation of very different spectra upon rotation
of the immobilized crystals already indicates that the overall anisotropy
of the single crystal (and that of a collection of large crystals)
is certainly large. The field reachable in EPR is comparatively low
(5000 G, i.e., a value significantly smaller than that in SQUID experiments)
and thus can only rotate a part of the magnetization and overcome
local anisotropies, with the result of giving rise to the small hysteresis
observed. A size-controlled difference in the anisotropy energy, on
the other hand, might be explained on a different basis. Au25(SC2Ph)180 has
only one spin s = 1/2 but the not-so-small radius
of 13.2 Å.36 This makes the saturation
magnetization low, and the magnetostatic effects should not be particularly
relevant. Simulation of the spectrum of the single crystal indicates
that the surface contribution to magnetization must be taken into
account, and therefore, that the surface anisotropy should be important.
Any surface effect is clearly even more important for the microcrystalline
sample, which includes a significant fraction of tiny crystals. An
increase in the magnetic anisotropy due to the surface effect was
already observed.60 Moreover, surface effects
on magnetic moment and anisotropy have been inferred to be important
also for the nanomagnetism of gold.61 The
study of the connection between the shape and the magnetic properties
is also receiving attention in the context of other metal nanoparticles.62

Figure 7 Hysteresis cw-EPR experiments for a large collection of
Au25(SC2Ph)180 microcrystals. (a) Effect of decreasing the temperature from
60 to 9 K and (b) corresponding temperature increase. The black and
the red traces indicate the low-to-high- and high-to-low-field directions,
respectively.

The fact that hysteresis
apparently becomes less evident at the
lowest temperatures is an artifact related to the rest time spent
at 5000 G. Because of the high anisotropy value compared to the thermal
energy at these temperatures, the magnetization relaxation time (τ)
becomes very long. If the rest time is not sufficiently long, at the
beginning of the downward scan the magnetization has not yet completely
relaxed; that is, the sample is still experiencing a situation that
is slightly similar to that of the low-field equilibrium. An example
of the effect of the rest time (at 20 K), which results in a slightly
larger hysteresis, is provided in Figure S11. At even lower temperatures, increasing the rest time significantly
becomes experimentally unfeasible. For example, use of the Neél–Arrhenius
equation, τ = τ0 exp(Ean/kBT),63 and the pertinent approximate Ean values show that, at 10 K, τ of the microcrystals
is at least 1 order of magnitude longer than that for the single crystal
(for which we waited 30 min). Finally, the persistence of the paramagnetic
signal of the isolated clusters, partially overlapping with the ferromagnetic
signal, is attributed to the finest or the most amorphous fraction
of the sample.

An evident new spectral feature emerges upon
reaching the lowest
temperature explored. Figure 7a shows that as T decreases the ferromagnetic
signal broadens and nearly disappears upon reaching 15 K, whereas
it sharpens abruptly at 9 K. Such a sudden change is typical of a
phase transition or some other physical changes in the sample. To
gain insights into its nature, we recorded an additional set of hysteresis
experiments by increasing the temperature from 9 K (Figure 7b). A comparison between the
plots in Figure 7a,b
shows that the spectra of the two sets are remarkably different. This
difference could be attributed to a phase transition,64 but this would reproduce the pattern when the experiment
at the given temperature is repeated. Instead, the memory of the phenomenon
that takes place at 9 K is evidently maintained in the subsequent
experiments, as shown in Figure 7b, which indicates that an irreversible transformation
occurred. It is also worth noting that once the temperature is >40
K, virtually the same spectrum is observed, regardless of how that
temperature was reached. The spectra become indistinguishable (we
checked it up to 290 K by repeating the same patterns of Figure 6), essentially when
hysteresis disappears. The same signal shape obtained at 9 K is also
observed after the sample is kept for 1 day at room temperature. It
disappears only upon physically removing, shaking, and then reinserting
the EPR tube into the cavity. The most plausible explanation for the
phenomenon occurring at 9 K is thus a physical reorientation of the
microcrystals, as similarly observed for the large crystal/s. The
microcrystals would thus minimize their magnetic energy by aligning
their anisotropy axes with the magnetic field, with the consequence
of sharpening the signal. Once the crystals reorganize, the resulting
orientation is maintained. This phenomenon takes place only at low
temperature because at higher temperatures the sample can minimize
its energy by another relaxation mechanism, that is, partial alignment
of the magnetization with the field. To do this, it must overcome
an energy barrier due to magnetic anisotropy. At low temperature,
this barrier is too high compared to the thermal energy, and therefore,
the physical rotation mechanism prevails.

The measurements carried
out on the ensemble of microcrystals show
that also this sample exhibits a ferromagnetic behavior; in this case,
however, a paramagnetic component, associated with weakly interacting
clusters in less crystalline zones, is also observed. These results
further confirm that the observed ferromagnetic behavior is strongly
affected by the physical characteristics of the samples. In the following
sections, we will address possible explanations for the observed behaviors.

Theoretical Analysis of the EPR Data
The leading factor
that controls the magnetization of a ferromagnetic particle in definite
directions is the magnetic anisotropy energy. Microscopically, for
heavy elements, the anisotropy energy is mainly determined by the
SO interaction.65 The SO coupling constant
for the isolated cluster can be estimated from the cw-EPR spectra
of the Au25(SC2Ph)180 film, which corresponds to the solid-state
situation in which the clusters are comparatively more magnetically
isolated. Thus, we developed a model by starting from the superatom
concept66 in which, for the diamagnetic
anion, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are viewed
as consisting of three degenerate P-type superatomic orbitals. In
fact, we already discussed that this triple degeneracy is not strictly
applicable as one orbital is found at a higher energy than the others;36 this was also found by taking into account the
effect of ligands on the frontier orbitals.67 Even by assuming full degeneracy, it is clear that upon the removal
of one electron to form Au25(SC2Ph)180, which has an effective spin s = 1/2, further orbital splitting occurs. Degeneracy can
be removed by SO coupling68 and/or distortions
because of the crystal field and the Jahn–Teller effect.41,69

The total Hamiltonian is then given by eq 3 3  where the four terms are the SO, the crystal
field, the spin, and the orbital Zeeman Hamiltonians (caused by the
applied magnetic field); S and L are the
spin and orbital moment operators, L and Lz are the modulus quantum number
and the z component operator of L, ge is the electronic g factor,
λ is the spin–orbit constant, D is the
axial distortion parameter, and B is the applied magnetic
field. The eigen energies of this Hamiltonian and the corresponding
EPR spectrum were calculated by matrix diagonalization.

The
red trace in Figure 8 shows the simulation of the experimental spectrum that was
carried out by using both the λ and D values
as fitting parameters. We find that, collectively, SO coupling and
crystal-field distortion make the energy of the three now-nondegenerate
HOMOs span an overall difference of 0.26 eV. This is an interesting
result indeed because it provides new relevant information regarding
the debated problem of the origin of orbital splitting upon the formation
of the Au25 SOMO. One view is that this is mainly due to
the SO coupling,68 whereas another assert
is that it is a Jahn–Teller-like distortion effect.41 In fact, according to our analysis of the EPR
data, both SO coupling and distortion contribute by comparable amounts
to the overall orbital splitting. As a further matter of fact, Figure 8 shows that the simulations
carried out by including only the SO effect or the crystal-field term
cannot reproduce the experimental spectrum.

Figure 8 Simulations of the cw-EPR
spectrum obtained at 5 K for the Au25(SC2Ph)180 film (black).
The simulations include SO and distortion (red),
only SO (blue), and only distortion (green).

The effect of the SO coupling on the Au25(SC2Ph)180 crystals can
also be evaluated from the spectrum of the single crystal. As we described
above, for the single crystal, we obtain a mean g value of 2.745. The remarkable deviation from the free electron ge value of 2.0023 indicates a high orbital moment
and a substantial contribution of SO effects. Indeed, only large SO
couplings allow for the orbital moment not to be quenched by the crystal
field. The ratio between the orbital and spin moments can be calculated,
using the Kittel equation70 4  

For our system, this ratio is 0.37. It is worth mentioning
that
the importance of the orbital contribution to the observed magnetism
is a feature that was already observed for large Au nanoparticles.26

DFT Calculations
DFT simulations
were performed to
draw further insights into the magnetic properties of Au25(SR)18 and quantify to what extent magnetism is affected
by the interplay of factors including SO coupling, Jahn–Teller
symmetry breaking, and crystal assembly (i.e., the difference between
the single cluster and its assembly in the crystal). To disentangle
these effects, three different structural models were considered for
the neutral Au25(SR)18 species: two of them
consist of individual Au25(SCH3)18 clusters, the first one where the Au25(SC)18 core was taken from the experimental crystal data49 (adding and relaxing H atoms as needed) and a second one
where the geometry of anionic Au25(SCH3)18– was fully relaxed at the DFT/PBE0 level,
and a third periodic solid-state model of four Au25(SC2Ph)180 clusters in the
unit cell. Hereafter, these models are denoted as Au25(SCH3)180 crystal, Au25(SCH3)180 anion, and Au25(SC2Ph)180 crystal, respectively.
Transforming Au25(SC2Ph)180 into Au25(SCH3)180 is a convenient
way of reducing the computational effort, and the comparison between
the Au25(SCH3)180-crystal and Au25(SC2Ph)180-crystal models
will assess the effect of this commonly used approximation. The Jahn–Teller
symmetry breaking is absent in the anionic Au25(SCH3)18–, which is an electronic
closed-shell species, and thus, the comparison between the Au25(SCH3)180-crystal and Au25(SCH3)180-anion
models helps quantify Jahn–Teller effects. The NWChem package71 was employed to simulate individual MPCs by
using the hybrid B3LYP72 exchange–correlation
(xc) DFT functional at the scalar relativistic level or by treating
the SO coupling effects within the zeroth-order relativistic approximation
(ZORA)73 and the van Wüllen formalism.74 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that a hybrid xc functional and SO coupling are simultaneously
employed to describe an MPC. The OpenMx package75 using the local density approximation (LDA)76 was used for the solid-state nonspin-collinear
calculations. Further details and a comparison/validation of the present
approach with previous literature are provided in the Supporting Information.

The orbital scheme
predicted by these simulations is summarized in Figure 9. In the absence of Jahn–Teller symmetry
breaking, the geometry of the Au25(SCH3)180-anion model approximately
corresponds to an S6 point symmetry group that presents triply degenerate
superatomic 1P orbitals, although in the anion, as already noted,36,68 a residual splitting between two higher lying orbitals and one lower
lying orbital is present (∼0.04 eV). Switching to the neutral
species and introducing cluster deformation due to the Jahn–Teller
effect in the Au25(SCH3)180-crystal model completely lift
the degeneracy of the 1P orbitals, leaving a higher lying SOMO, a
HOMO – 1 lower in energy by 0.04 eV, and a HOMO – 2
further lower in energy by 0.09 eV. SO coupling further increases
the orbital splitting by bringing the first and second energy gaps
to 0.12 and 0.15 eV, respectively. Because of SO coupling and Jahn–Teller
effects, the three HOMOs are found to span an overall energy difference
of 0.27 eV, in an excellent agreement with the EPR-derived value of
0.26 eV.

(J–T) effects, and Au25(SCH3)180 including SO
coupling (SOC) in the Au25(SCH3)180-crystal geometry.

Nonspin-collinear DFT/LDA calculations
were performed on the Au25(SC2Ph)180-crystal model (for details, see the Supporting Information). Calculations in which spin modulus and orientation
were relaxed starting from several initial orientations were first
conducted to determine the preferential magnetization axis, which
turns out to be the z-axis with a total spin component
of 3.59μB and a total orbital component of 1.25μB per unit cell. This corresponds to a predicted ratio μL/μS of 0.35, in excellent agreement with
the value calculated from the single-crystal spectrum simulation,
0.37. The direction and magnitude of atomic spins in the energetically
most stable ferromagnetic solution thus derived are schematically
depicted in Figure 10. It is worth noting that the spin density is mostly located on Au
atoms but also extends on S and on both aliphatic and aromatic carbons.
An exponentially decreasing delocalization of the spin moment from
the Au/S MPC framework onto both aliphatic and aromatic C atoms has
been noted and studied before.35 Here,
we find that spin polarization is induced also on the phenyl groups,
as shown in the form of the small arrows displayed on the rings in Figure 10; this long-range
effect is likely due to a solid-state proximity effect by adjacent
S atoms. This finding would thus rationalize the experimentally observed
magnetism in the solid state and its subtle dependence on crystallinity
as caused by the presence of oriented spin moments on the neighboring
π-stacked phenyl residues.77 We were
not able to locate the barrier for spin reorientation and thus the
anisotropy energy. It is, however, worth mentioning that in our calculations
we found another spin local minimum in which the magnetic moment is
oriented along the x-axis (see Figure 10) with a total spin component
per unit cell of 2.02μB and a total orbital component
per unit cell of 0.37μB, nearly degenerate in energy
with the spin global minimum.

and magnitude of atomic spins

Au atoms are not shown as they would be out of scale). The image shows
the unit cell as seen from the direction c;49 all clusters but the central one are thus incomplete.
The color codes are Au = yellow, S = red, and C = gray. Au and S atoms

Conclusions
Magnetometry techniques
are generally used to study the magnetic
properties of materials but have failed to provide coherent results
for Au MPCs. The most important cause of the discrepancy in previous
studies was undoubtedly the lack of precise control on MPC stoichiometry
and charge state. Interestingly, even for a controlled MPC such as
paramagnetic Au25(SC2Ph)180, SQUID was unable to detect magnetic behaviors
other than simple paramagnetism. Here, we employ the more molecular
experimental approach based on EPR spectroscopy, which allows separating
different contributions to the magnetic susceptibility by focusing
on clearly distinguishable signals and eliminating diamagnetic contributions.

By using samples meant to provide a range of specific examples
of crystalline orders and physical states, we could detect paramagnetism,
superparamagnetism, and ferromagnetism and evidence physical reorganization
of the samples as a function of the applied field. Besides rationalizing
the relevant phenomenological aspects, we carried out theoretical
analyses. Simulations of the EPR spectra based on the superatom model
showed that both SO coupling and crystal-field distortions play a
role in determining the EPR properties of Au25(SC2Ph)180 in the solid
state. The excellent agreement of the experimentally derived effects
brought about by SO and crystal splitting, as well as the ratio between
the orbital and spin moments, with the outcome of complex first principles
simulations unequivocally supports the soundness of the present analysis.
Calculations point to the proximity effects in the solid state as
the origin of magnetic interactions and the reason for their crucial
dependence upon crystallinity.

We believe that this study provides
a key to understand the conflicting
magnetic behaviors in solid MPC samples. Together with our previous
findings concerning the ligand-induced antiferromagnetic behavior
in Au25 clusters,42 it is now
clear that several factors should be considered for effectively controlling
the magnetic behavior of MPCs. As also discussed in the Introduction, for larger MPCs of unknown structure and possibly
variable charge states, the situation is more complex and probably
definable only on a statistical basis. Regardless, the results described
here for Au25(SC2Ph)180 could pave the way to enable controlled magnetism-related
applications of gold MPCs, especially those based on the use of molecular
MPCs.

Experimental Section
Au25(SC2Ph)180 Synthesis
The synthesis
of Au25(SC2Ph)18 was carried out in tetrahydrofuran
(THF).
The details are as already described,35 except for the addition of tetra-n-octylammonium
(nOct4N+) bromide, before the
reduction steps, to the THF solution containing HAuCl4·3H2O. The cluster was prepared as [nOct4N+][Au25(SC2Ph)18–] and purified by dissolving it in a mixture of diethyl ether (to
precipitate most of the residual tetraoctylammonium salt) and by washing
the product, obtained by the evaporation of diethyl ether, with ice-cold
methanol.

Preparation of the Film
A sample of the so-prepared
[nOct4N+][Au25(SC2Ph)18–] was quantitatively oxidized to form
Au25(SC2Ph)180 by passing through a silica-gel chromatography column under
aerobic conditions.50 Au25(SC2Ph)180 (4.0 mg) was
dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane and injected into an EPR tube.
The solvent was evaporated with a stream of nitrogen to leave an amorphous
colored film covering the bottom wall of the tubing.

Preparation
of the Single Crystals
Large single crystals
were prepared by electrocrystallization.49 The experiments were carried out with a CHI 660c electrochemical
workstation, under an Ar atmosphere in an air-tight glass electrochemical
cell, at room temperature, and using 20 mL of MeCN containing 0.1
M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the
solvent–electrolyte system. The working electrode was a 0.75
mm diameter, 15 mm long gold wire, and the counter electrode was a
Pt plate inserted into a glass holder separated from the analyte solution
with a G3 glass frit and a plug of electrolyte-saturated methylcellulose
gel.78 The electrolysis was carried out
at a constant current of 200 nA. The one-electron electro-oxidation
of 4.82 × 10–5 M Au25(SC2Ph)18– was carried out until 8% of the anion
was still present in the solution. The electrogenerated Au25(SC2Ph)180 is
insoluble in MeCN and deposits well onto the electrode body to form
a forest of single crystals. The single crystals were collected from
the electrocrystallization experiment that led to the image shown
in Figure S1. All pictures were taken using
a Firefly GT800 High Precision Video Microscope.

Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance
The crystalline Au25(SCPh)180 samples, one
single crystal, a few crystals, or many microcrystals,
were introduced into 1.9 mm i.d.–3.0 mm o.d. (used for the
film and the microcrystals) or 2.9 mm i.d.–3.9 mm o.d. (used
for all other samples) quartz tubes. The tubes containing the film
or crystals were degassed by several freeze–pump–thaw
cycles and sealed off under vacuum (5 × 10–5 Torr). X-band cw-EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Elexsys
E580 spectrometer equipped with a dielectric probehead. The temperature
was controlled by a helium continuous-flow cryostat (Oxford CF935)
and a variable-temperature controller unit (Oxford ITC-4). When the
desired temperature was reached, the samples were thermalized before
carrying out the actual experiments. All experimental data were collected
under nonsaturating microwave conditions (microwave power PMW = 150 μW or lower). A modulation frequency
of 100 kHz and an amplitude (peak to peak) of 1 G were used for all
spectra. The field scan rate was 47.68 G s–1. Simulation
of EPR spectra was carried out by using the Matlab 7.12 software platform.
The ferromagnetic and paramagnetic signals were simulated with ad
hoc written codes based on the models developed in this paper. The
standard g-tensor-based simulations were performed
using the routines from the EasySpin toolbox.79
