Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles
(UCNPs) have attracted
great attention in bioimaging applications. However, the stability
and resolution of bioimaging based on UCNPs should be further improved.
Herein, we synthesized SiO2-coated Ga(III)-doped ZnO (GZO)
with lanthanide ion Yb(III) and Tm(III) (Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2) UCNPs, which realized red fluorescence imaging in heart tissue.
With increasing injection concentrations of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 (1–10 mg/kg), the red fluorescence imaging intensity of heart
tissue gradually increased. Moreover, the experimental results of
toxicity in vitro and histological assessments of representative organs
in vivo were studied, indicating that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 UCNPs
had low biological toxicity. These results proved that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 can be used as a probe for fluorescence imaging in vivo.

Introduction
Fluorescence imaging
has attracted great attention in biological
applications due to its high resolution and sensitivity.1−3 Excellent in vivo and in vitro fluorescence imaging of cells requires
some key factors such as a low imaging background, high fluorescence
efficiency, and good imaging of photostability. However, the excitation
source of traditional fluorescence imaging is ultraviolet or visible
light, which has interference from autofluorescence and strong absorption.4,5 It is well known that the near-infrared (NIR) region from 750 to
1000 nm is one of the “optical transmission windows”.1,6 Fluorescence imaging in vitro and in vivo excited in the NIR light
has some advantages, such as low light scattering, deep light penetration,
and a high signal-to-noise ratio.7−10 Conventional NIR chromophores are organic
dyes and quantum rods (QDs). However, organic dyes have poor photostability
and toxicity, which significantly limit their application in biological
fluorescent probes.11−13

Lanthanide-doped (Ln3+, such as
Yb3+, Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+) upconversion nanoparticles
(UCNPs) are a kind of emerging biological materials.14−21 Upconversion luminescence (UCL) is anti-Stokes emission, which can
convert to ultraviolet (UV) or visible (vis) emission via absorbing
near-infrared (NIR) light. UCNPs based on their unique properties
have been considered an important material for bioimaging applications.22−28 Biological fluorescent probes based on lanthanide-doped UCNPs can
be excited using 750–1000 nm NIR light.29−33 Therefore, UCNPs show little absorption to biological
components such as lipids and hemoglobin, which significantly improves
deep tissue penetration and the signal-to-noise ratio.34−38 It is challenging to develop a fluorescent probe with high UCL efficiency
and good stability for bioimaging in living cells. In fact, the host
has an important influence on UCL properties.39−42 An oxide host has high chemical
stability and thermal stability compared to fluorides. Choosing suitable
oxides with low phonon energy as the host can increase the UCL intensity
and fluorescence stability. For example, zinc oxide (ZnO) has been
identified as a good host candidate due to its long-term stability,
low toxicity, and wide direct gap.43−46

However, it is still a
big challenge to achieve high-resolution
fluorescence imaging with UCNPs. The most common interaction between
UCNPs and cells has a large influence on the toxicity and cellular
localization of UCNPs. It has been reported that nanoparticles usually
entered the cell through endocytosis.47,48 The four mechanisms
of endocytosis are: (i) micropinocytosis (size >1 μm), (ii)
clathrin-mediated endocytosis (60 nm < size < 120 nm), (III)
caveolae-mediated endocytosis (size <60 nm), and (iv) caveolae-independent
endocytosis. Therefore, UCNPs can enter the cell via the coated surface
on UCNPs.49−51 Coating of UCNPs with silica shell as an effective
method can improve the biocompatibility of nanoparticles. The SiO2 shell prevents the direct interaction of UCNPs with biomolecules.
Meanwhile, lanthanide ions on the surface of UCNPs show no luminescence
emission, due to which these rare-earth ions are less perturbed by
the degenerated crystalline fields of the host interfaces. Upon silica
coating, cooperative crystalline fields are formed between the core
surfaces and the coated shells, which excites the “dormant”
Ln3+ ions (nonluminance Ln3+ ions) on the surface
of nanoparticles.52 The silica-coated surface
not only improves the colloidal stability and prevents nonspecific
cell uptake but also enhances the UCL efficiency.53 Despite recent success in Yb/Tm co-doped UCNPs NIR region
(about 800 nm) emission bioimaging, in vivo imaging with red emission
had no establish at low pumping power due to low red UC quantum efficiency.

In this work, the influence of relative concentrations of the silica
coated on Yb/Tm/GZO (UCNPs) was investigated. Compared to the tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS)-free sample, the UCL intensity of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 increased about 13 times compared to that of Yb/Tm/ZnO UCNPs.
The red UC quantum efficiency of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 was as
high as 1.0 ± 0.1% under excitation with a low power density
of ∼0.3 W/cm2. The red UCL imaging of heart tissue
treated with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 was achieved under 980 nm excitation.
With the increase of the injection concentrations of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2, red fluorescence imaging of heart tissue gradually increased.
Moreover, we proved that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 had low toxicity
in vitro and in vivo.

Results and Discussion
As shown
in Scheme 1, Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 core/shell nanoparticles entered the
cytoplasm via endocytosis. Upon 980 nm excitation, Yb3+/Tm3+ ions were excited and radiated UCL, realizing red
(650 nm) light bioimaging.

Synthesis
and Characterization
Yb/Tm/GZO UCNPs were
synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Cit3– served
as a structure regulating the size and morphology of Yb/Tm/GZO UCNPs. Figure 1A shows the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of Yb/Tm/GZO UCNPs. These Yb/Tm/GZO
UCNPs exhibited structures of peony flowers and had good dispersibility.
The silica coating on UCNPs can reduce the surface defects and improve
the colloidal stability. Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 was synthesized
via the Stöber method with increasing tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) concentrations from 0.36 to 0.90 mL (Figure 1B). The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 with different TEOS concentrations
are shown in Figure 1C. With 0.36 mL of TEOS, core–shell structures were not completely
obtained (see Figure 1C1). With increasing TEOS concentrations, Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 with core–shell structure was obtained, as demonstrated in Figure 1C2–C3. The
size was 63.27 ± 1.18 nm at 0.60 mL of TEOS, 12 nm larger than
the core (see Figure 1D). This result was obtained by measuring a total of 80 nanoparticles
from four TEM images. With increasing TEOS up to 0.9 mL, obvious two
cores were coated by the SiO2 shell (Figure 1C4). These results indicate that the core–shell
structure can be controlled in Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 by varying
the concentration of TEOS.

Optical Properties
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of Yb/Tm/GZO and Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 are shown in Figure 2A. The diffraction peaks matched
those of the hexagonal ZnO nanoparticles (JCPDs card no. 36-1541).
The wide diffraction peaks due to amorphous SiO2 were not
found, suggesting that the SiO2 coating showed no change
in the phase of Yb/Tm/GZO UCNPs. To determine the successful preparation
of the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 core–shell structure UCNPs,
characteristic functional groups of Yb/Tm/GZO and Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 were examined via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry.
As shown in Figure 2B, the bands at 496 and 1495 cm–1 were ascribed
to the Zn–O and O–H bending in the spectra of both Yb/Tm/GZO
and Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2, respectively. In the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 system, bands at 955 and 725 cm–1 were
associated with the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations
of the Si–O–Si group, respectively. The bands at 2490
and 3490 cm–1 corresponded to the stretching vibrations
of the Si–H and Si–O–H groups, respectively.45 These results proved that SiO2 was
successfully coated on UCNPs. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectra of Yb/Tm/GZO and Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 were
also recorded, as shown in Figure 2C. Compared to the UV–vis absorption edge of
Yb/Tm/GZO UCNP, the absorption band edge of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 showed a blue shift, indicating that the energy for the 2p orbital
transition of O2– ions increased. The SiO2 coating reduced the surface defect of Yb/Tm/GZO and thus bind free
electrons transfer, which increased the energy absorbed for the electron
transition in Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2.

room temperature; the inset shows the digital photographs of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 (TEOS: 0.6 mL) with different assembly times from 0 to 25
days.

To verify the effect of SiO2 coating on UCL intensity,
the UCL spectra of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 with different TEOS contents
were recorded, as shown in Figure 2D. In comparison to the TEOS-free sample, the blue
and red UCL intensities had been significantly enhanced with increasing
TEOS content. Particularly, when the content of TEOS was 0.60 mL,
UCL intensities were about 13 times higher than that of Yb/Tm/GZO.
The red upconversion absolute quantum yield (QY) of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 was obtained by the integrating sphere to be 1.0 ± 0.1%
with 0.6 mL of TEOS. This high absolute QY for red upconversion emission
was achieved at a low excitation density (0.3 W/cm2), indicating
that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 UCNPs showed a great promising application
in bioimaging. Moreover, with increasing TEOS concentration, the decay
lifetimes of red UCL (650 nm) increased from 286 to 366 μs (Figure 2E). With increasing
TEOS content, surface defects of UCNPs decreased. Meanwhile, the linear
relationship between surface vibrations and SA/Vol can be represented
as quenchers ([Q]) (eq 1). 1  When
the surface defects decreased, [Q] is significantly
decreased. The decay lifetime was described
using the Stern–Volmer (eq 2). 2  where τ is the decay lifetime
with quenchers,
τ0 is the observed decay lifetime without quenchers, kq is the rate constant of the quencher, and
τ0 represents an ideal condition and can be regarded
as a constant. The positive proportion relationship between 1/τ
and [Q] shows that [Q] decreased
when the decay lifetime increased. A high decay lifetime can be achieved
with increasing TEOS. In addition, considering that the SiO2 shell had an influence on the UCL intensity of UCNPs, the UCL properties
of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 were investigated at different times
from 0 to 25 days at room temperature. Figure 2F shows that the UCL intensities of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 had no change with the extension of times, which indicated
that the SiO2 shell greatly maintained the stability of
core–shell nanoparticles.

To validate that SiO2 coating had an effect on Yb/Tm/GZO
UCL properties, the upconversion transfer mechanism of the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 core/shell system was determined. In Figure 3C, the blue UCL can be ascribed to radiative
energy transfer from the 1G4 to 3H6 state of the Tm3+ ion. The red UCL can be
attributed to radiative energy transfer from the 1G4 to 3F4 state of the Tm3+ ion. To further confirm the photon excitation process of core–shell
nanoparticles, the dependence of the UCL intensity of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles on the power density was examined. As shown
in Figure 3B, the slopes
of UCL at wavelengths of 475 and 650 nm were 2.61 and 1.88, respectively.
This was because the blue and red UCL emissions of Tm3+ were attributed to the three-photon process and two-photon process,
respectively. Compared to the number of photons in Yb/Tm/GZO (Figure S1), the number of photons in Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 decreased. Without SiO2 shell coating, Tm3+-ion-doped GZO can be excited to produce UCL emission, owing
to the perturbation of the crystal field in the GZO system. Because
of this, the boundary was weakly disturbed by the degenerate crystal
field on the surface of GZO nanoparticles. The Tm3+ ions
near and embedded in the surface layer of the GZO host did not produce
UCL emission and are called dormant ions. SiO2 coating
of Yb/Tm/GZO resulted in the interaction of the degenerated crystal
field on the surface of GZO and the coordination field produced. These
reduced the selection rule of radiative transitions of the dormant
rare-earth ions (Yb3+/Tm3+). The dormant ions
can be activated. The excited dormant ions were called the “activated”
rare-earth ions. As shown in Figure 3A, SiO2 coating on the surface of Yb/Tm/GZO
reduced the selection rule of radiative transitions and the dormant
Tm3+/Yb3+ ions became the new luminescence centers.
Owing to the large specific surface of nanoparticles, a large number
of new luminescent centers were formed on the surface of GZO nanoparticles.
The UCL intensity of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles enhanced
compared to that of Yb/Tm/GZO. The SiO2 shell coating not
only improved the fluorescence stability of Yb/Tm/GZO but also enhanced
the UCL intensity of Yb/Tm/GZO upconversion nanoparticles.

Biological Toxicity Properties
Cytotoxicity Test of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2
Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles have potential
applications in bioprobes due
to their strong UCL and good biocompatibility. However, biotoxicity
plays an important role in the development of nanocrystals for biological
applications. Herein, the cytotoxicity of the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 core/shell UCNPs was measured. The human hepatic cell line 7702
is one of the most common human normal cell lines. The human hepatic
tumor cell line HpG2 is one of the most representative human tumor
cell systems. Therefore, a CCK8 assay with 7702 cells and HpG2 cells
was used to investigate the cytotoxicity of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles (Figure 4). The 7702 and HpG2 cell viability can be quantified using eq 3. 3  where As is the
absorbance of test cells with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanocomposites,
and Ab and Ac stand for the absorbance of control cells without (Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2) nanocomposites and the absorbance of blank samples containing
the culture medium (without cells and (Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2)),
respectively. As shown in Figure 4A, the viability of 7702 cells showed no significant
difference at different concentrations of 100–800 μg/mL
Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 for 24, 48, and 72 h. After incubating as
high as 800 μg/mL of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 for 24 h, the
cell viabilities were greater than 90.48%. The cell viabilities of
7702 cells kept 86.69%, despite the existence of a high concentration
of 800 μg/mL and a long time of 72 h. As shown in Figure 4B, the viability of HpG2 was
99.17% after treatment of 100 μg/mL of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 for 24 h. The cellular viabilities were estimated to be greater
than 99.15% with a high dosage 800 μg/mL and 72 h. These results
proved that the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 core/shell had low cytotoxicity,
suggesting Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 as a good bioimaging probe.

In Vivo Toxicity Test of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2
To further
study the in vivo toxicity of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles,
blood biochemical indexes were examined in Kunming
mouse with injecting different doses of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 through
the tail vein (Figure 5). The levels of albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and cholesterol
(CHOL) were related to the degree of liver cell damage, which was
used as indicators to assess the function of the liver. Compared to
that of control, the serum levels of ALB, ALP, ALT, AST, and CHOL
had no significant change with increasing Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 from 1 to 10 mg/kg (Figure 5A–E) for 24 h and 7 days post-injection. The result
of the serum aminotransferases (ALB, ALP, ALT, and AST) revealed that
injection with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles had no obvious
liver injury. As shown in Figure 5H–J, the levels of serum creatinine (CRE), uric
acid (UA), and urea (UREA) were further studied to identify nephrotoxicity
after treating with 1–10 mg/kg Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 for
24 h and 7 days. The results showed that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 had no effect on the levels of CRE, UA, or UREA in serum, indicating
that injection with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 did not cause obvious
damage to the nephro. In addition, the degree of creatine kinase (CK)
was used to evaluate damage to the heart. As shown in Figure 5F, even after 7 days of injection
with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 at a concentration as high as 10 mg/kg,
the levels of serum CK had no obvious change compared to the control
group, suggesting that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 injection had no
obvious damage to the heart. Meanwhile, the levels of serum total
protein (TP) were similar for the mouse injected with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 and for the control mouse (Figure 5G). It was proved that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 UCNPs had low toxicity in vivo, indicating their potential
for biological applications.

To further determine the possible
tissue toxicity, histological
assessments of representative organs such as the heart, liver, kidney,
and spleen were performed, as shown in Table 1. Daily behavior of the Kuming mice, including
drinking, eating, and activity, in the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2-injected
groups was identical to that in the control group. As shown in Table 1, there was no significant
effect on the coefficients of the liver, kidney, and spleen 24 h after
injection of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles. Compared to
the control groups (5.01 ± 0.87 mg/g), the coefficient of the
heart was slightly increased (7.09 ± 0.21 mg/g) 24 h after the
tail vein injection of 10 mg/kg Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles
but without statistical significance (ap > 0.05). The coefficients of the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen
had no apparent change after 7 days of injection with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 at all dosages (1–10 mg/kg). These results demonstrate
that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles have low tissue toxicity
and great potential applications for bioimaging.

From the analysis of tissue
toxicity, we found that the coefficient
of the heart was slightly increased. To assess the in vivo tissue
imaging of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles, confocal imaging
of heart tissue was studied, as shown in Figure 6. The heart was dissected out and fresh-frozen
in the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding medium (Sakura
Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan) Sections of 10 μm were cut
from frozen blocks at −20 °C. Confocal imaging was done
using an OLYMPUS FV500 laser scanning confocal microscope, and their
upconversion luminescence was captured by channels set at 640–660
nm for receiving red upconversion emission. Figure 6 shows the multiphoton confocal imaging of
heart tissue treated with 1–10 mg/kg Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 following excitation at 980 nm using a femtosecond pulsed laser.
The 650 nm emission (red color) of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 under
980 nm excitation was detected. Furthermore, with increasing injection
concentrations of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2, remarkably enhanced bright
red luminescence was achieved, demonstrating that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 can effectively improve heart tissue imaging. These results
suggested that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles showed excellent
ability in bioimaging applications.

The excitation at 980 nm was provided from a pulsed laser, and the

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the effect of different
TEOS concentrations
on upconversion luminescence properties of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2. With 0.6 mL of TEOS, the UCL intensity of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 enhanced about 13 times compared to that of Yb/Tm/GZO. SiO2 coating enhanced the UCL stability and biocompatibility of Yb/Tm/GZO,
which achieved red light imaging of heart tissue in vivo. In addition,
the red fluorescence imaging of heart tissue gradually brightened
with increasing injection concentrations of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 from 1 to 10 mg/kg. In vitro toxicity results indicated that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 had no significant influence on the cellular viabilities
of 7702 cells and HpG2 cells after 72 h incubation with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 (100–800 μg/mL). In vivo toxicity results indicated
that injection with Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles had no
obvious liver and kidney injury. The histological assessments of representative
organs suggested that injection of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles
had no significant effect on the coefficients of the heart, liver,
kidney, and spleen. These studies provided that Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles have low biotoxicity and high-resolution red
tissue imaging.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemical materials, ytterbium nitrate
pentahydrate (Yb(NO3)3·5H2O,
99.99%), thulium nitrate pentahydrate (Tm(NO3)3·5H2O, 99.99%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9%), gallium nitrate
(Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, 99.99%), isopropyl alcohol, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), citric
acid sodium, ammonia (NH3·H2O, 25%), and
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were used directly as received without further
purification.

Synthesis of Yb/Tm/GZO
A hydrothermal
method was followed:
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol), deionized
(DI, 10 mL) water, and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (10 mol %) were dissolved by magnetic stirring
for 30 min, and citric acid sodium was added to form a clarified liquid
by magnetic stirring for 20 min. NaOH (2 mol/L, 10 mL) was added into
the above clarified liquid to form a suspension solution by magnetic
stirring for 30 min. Tm(NO3)3·5H2O (with 0.5 mol %, 5 mL) and Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (7 mol %, 5 mL) were added into the suspension solution
by magnetic stirring for 60 min. Subsequently, the solution was transferred
into a 50 mL hydrothermal reactor. The solution was heated to 150
°C for 24 h. The resultant solution was cooled down and cleaned
by centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 15 min with copious amounts of ethanol
and DI water. Yb/Tm/GZO was obtained by oven drying at 60 °C
for 24 h.

Synthesis of Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2
Isopropyl alcohol
(40 mL) was added to Yb/Tm/GZO (0.1713 g) by ultrasonication for 30
min to form a suspension solution. DI water (10 mL) was added into
the mixture by magnetic stirring for 10 min. NH3·H2O (5 mL, 25%) was dropped into the suspension solution at
32 °C by magnetic stirring for 20 min. TEOS was dropped slowly
into the above solution at 32 °C by magnetic stirring for 90
min. The amounts of TEOS were 0.36, 0.45, 0.60, and 0.90 mL, respectively.
The resultant solution was cooled down to room temperature. The solution
was washed six times with copious amounts of ethanol and DI water
by centrifuge at 3500 rpm. The products were collected after oven
drying at 80 °C for 24 h.

Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern measurements were performed
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). Size and morphologies
of UCNPs were determined at 15 kV using a focus voltage SU8000 scanning
electron microscope (SEM) and at 200 kV using a focus voltage JEOL
2010F transmission electron microscope (TEM). The upconversion emission
spectra of the nanoparticles were measured at 980 nm excitation. A
signal generator was used to convert a continuous 980 nm excitation
source to a pulse excitation source. The upconversion spectra of samples
used 980 nm as the excitation source. The excitation density was 0.3
W/cm2. The excitation source was focused on the sample
through a convex lens and became an upconversion luminous source.
The source point was the sample output upconversion fluorescence.
The upconversion fluorescence was absorbed by a photomultiplier tube
through a set of lenses. The photomultiplier tube type was CR131,
which could reach the test compensation of 1 nm, expand the light
signal, and then pass through. When the receiver receives the signal
and transmits the data to the connected computer, the upconversion
fluorescence spectrum of a certain band would appear on the computer.

The decay lifetime of the sample was obtained on a computer with
a 980 nm laser, MD03024 Mixed Domain Oscilloscope. The excitation
density was 0.3 W/cm2. The integrating sphere was used
to obtain the QY of UCNPs.

Cytotoxicity Assay
The normal human
hepatic cell line
(7702) and the human HpG2 were cultured in the RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum. The normal human hepatic cell line (7702)
and the human HpG2 were cultured in RPMI 1640 (HyClone, Thermo Fisher,
Beijing, China) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator (Thermo Forma) containing
5% CO2 at 37°C, and all of the experiments were performed
in a clean atmosphere. A CCK8 kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was
used for cell viability assay. A total of 5 × 103 cells/well
were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24
h. Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 in the RPMI 1640/DMEM medium was added
at final concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 μg/mL.
At the end of the fixed incubation period (24, 48, and 72 h), 10 μL
of the CCK8 reagent was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at
37 °C. The absorbance was recorded using a pan-wavelength microplate
reader at 450 nm (Synergy Mx; BioTek, Winooski, VT). Each experiment
was performed in triplicate. The cell viability can be quantified
using the following equation.  where As is the
absorbance of the test sample (test wells containing cells, culture
medium, and samples), Ab is the absorbance
of the control sample (control wells containing cells and culture
medium without samples), and Ac is the
absorbance of blank samples (blank wells containing the culture medium
without cell and samples).

In Vivo Toxicity and Imaging Studies
All animal experiments
and procedures were approved by the Animal Ethical and Experimental
Committee of the Tianjin Medical University Metabolic Diseases Hospital.
Five-week-old male Kunming mice (23–26 g) were purchased from
the animal center of Military Medical Sciences Academy of the PLA
(Permission no SCXK-(A) 2012-0004). All experimental mice were maintained
in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 22 °C and 55 ± 5% relative
humidity in a standard laboratory room at Tianjin Medical University
(Tianjin, China). The mice were provided rodent chow and water ad
libitum.

After a week of acclimation, the mice were randomly
allocated into four groups (eight animals in each group): three sample
groups (treated with final doses 1, 6, and 10 mg/kg of the Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 body weight) and a vehicle group (treated with an equivalent
volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Yb/Tm/GZO@SiO2 nanoparticles and PBS were injected via the tail vein. Eight mice
from each group were weighed and sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation
after 24 h and 7 days. Serum samples were collected by centrifugation
(3000g, 10 min). ALB, ALP, ALT, AST, CHOL, CK, TP,
CRE, UA, and UREA were detected according to the kit’s protocol
(Roche, People’s Republic of China). Liver, lung, spleen, kidney,
and heart samples were collected and weighed. The heart was dissected
out and fresh-frozen in the OCT embedding medium (Sakura Finetechnical
Co, Tokyo, Japan). Sections of 10 μm were cut from frozen blocks
at −20 °C, and confocal microscopy was used to observe
the imaging of cardiac myocytes. Confocal imaging was done using an
OLYMPUS FV500 laser scanning confocal microscope (120 × 10 oil
lens), and their upconversion luminescence was captured by channels
set at 640–660 nm for receiving red upconversion emission at
980 nm using a femtosecond pulsed laser under an excitation of 0.3
W/cm2.
