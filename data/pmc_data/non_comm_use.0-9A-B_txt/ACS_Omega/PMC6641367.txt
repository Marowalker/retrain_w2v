In
situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopic measurements of defect-free
monolayer graphene on various substrates were performed under electrochemical
potential control. The G and 2D Raman band wavenumbers (ωG, ω2D) of graphene were found to depend upon
the electrochemical potential, i.e., the charge density of graphene.
The values of ωG and ω2D also varied
depending on the choice of substrates. On metal substrates where graphene
was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, a strong blue shift
of ω2D was induced, which could not account for the
strain and charge doping. We attributed the blue shift of ω2D to a change in the electronic properties of graphene induced
by distinct electronic interactions with the metal substrates. To
explain the unique characteristics in the Raman spectrum of graphene
on various substrates, a novel mechanism is proposed considering reduction
of the Fermi velocity in graphene owing to dielectric screening from
the metal substrates.

Introduction
The vibrational properties
of graphene provide useful information
for studying its electronic, mechanical, and optical properties, which
can be optimized for various device applications. Raman spectroscopy
has been one of the most important techniques for vibrational characterization
of graphene since early investigations into graphene. Raman spectroscopy
is highly effective for revealing the characteristics of graphene,
such as the number of layers and defect density.1,2 Raman
spectroscopy can also be used for fundamental research, such as phonon
dispersion3 and electron–phonon
interactions in graphene.4 Although ideal
monolayer graphene has a definite atomic structure, it has been found
that experimental Raman spectra show inconsistencies in the literature,
even when the experimental parameters, such as temperature and wavelength
of the laser, are identical.

Two mechanisms, strain5−8 and charge doping,9−14 are usually considered to affect the Raman spectrum of graphene.
When the graphene is strained, the interaction strength between carbon
atoms changes. Thus, it is understandable that the phonon energy changes,
and these changes can be directly observed by Raman spectroscopy.
Every band in the Raman spectrum of graphene is affected by the strain.
However, the mechanism for the effects of charge doping on the Raman
spectrum of graphene is highly complex. For example, the expansion
of graphene owing to Pauli repulsion15 decreases
the energies of all of the bands.16 The
breakdown of the adiabatic Born–Oppenheimer approximation leads
to the stiffening and sharpening of the G band when it is charge doped.4 The theory of 2D band of charge-doped graphene
has yet to be completely resolved;17 however,
experimental studies have provided considerable information on this
effect under limited charge densities.

Knowing that the Raman
spectrum of graphene is affected by strain
and charge density, it is natural to consider that these factors can
also be determined from Raman spectroscopy measurements.14,18 One method has been proposed, based on the G and 2D Raman band wavenumbers
(ωG and ω2D), to estimate strain
and charge density simultaneously.19,20 However, this
method relies on the assumption that the change in ωG and ω2D of graphene can be completely described
by strain and charge density. There have already been some reports,
which have indicated that ωG and ω2D cannot be explained by strain and charge doping alone.21 The effects have also been attributed to Fermi
velocity modification owing to the interactions of graphene with its
substrate.22 However, the Fermi velocity
modification from weak Van der Waals interaction does not have enough
theoretical support. Therefore, a comprehensive study of the Raman
spectroscopy of graphene with analysis of all of the aspects, including
but not limited to strain and charge doping, would be highly desirable
for understanding the interactions between graphene and its environment.

In this article, the Raman spectroscopy of monolayer graphene was
measured on various substrates with electrochemical control. We found
that the Raman spectra of graphene is affected by strain, charge doping,
and electronic structure modification from substrate. The influence
of each factor could be clearly separated from the others. For graphene
on different substrates and prepared by different methods, the divergence
of ω2D could not be explained by a combination of
strain and charge doping. In particular, the ω2D values
of graphene grown on metal substrates, such as Au and Cu, were considerably
higher than those transferred to other substrates. We show that the
Fermi velocity modification can change ω2D, whereas
ωG remains unchanged. The dielectric screening mechanism
of the reduction of the Fermi velocity on metal substrates could be
well explained by the existing theoretical approaches, which confirmed
our experimental results. We also found that dielectric screening
from the metal substrates was only observed for the proper interaction
strength between graphene and metal. Only high-temperature treatments
such as in situ chemical vapor deposition (CVD) provide this condition.
This paper provides a new way to observe and understand substrate–graphene
interactions. These findings could help to explain the electronic,
optical, and chemical properties of graphene more reasonably, with
consideration of its interactions with other materials. This idea
could also be extended to other systems of one-dimensional and two-dimentional
materials, which might enable the realization of new properties and
functionalities by optimizing interactions with their base materials.

Results
and Discussion
The Raman spectra of G/Cu foil, G/Au(111),
G/SiO2, and
G/indium tin oxide (ITO) in air are shown in Figure 1a. The G/Cu foil and G/Au(111) were prepared
by CVD on the metal substrates. The graphene of G/SiO2 and
G/ITO were transferred from G/Cu foil. The samples were all measured
under same conditions. The background due to photoluminescence23−26 from Cu and Au substrates was subtracted for a more robust comparison.
All of the samples showed clear G and 2D bands typical of graphene.
The intensity ratios between the 2D and G bands (I2D/IG) were between 2 and
4. The full width at half-maxima (FWHMs) of the 2D bands were between
25 and 35 cm–1. These observations suggest that
these were all monolayer graphene.27 The
D bands in these samples were negligible, hence we regarded these
graphene to be defect free. Notably, the Raman spectra of graphene
on different substrates showed clear difference in all aspects, including
the Raman shifts of the bands and their intensities and FWHMs. These
findings imply that the substrate has a strong influence on the Raman
spectrum of graphene.

and 2D bands of G/ITO as a function of electrode potential.

To characterize the effects of
the charge doping, electrochemical
Raman (EC-Raman) spectra of G/ITO were measured. The original spectra
at respective electrochemical potentials (ϕ) are shown in Figure S1. The values of ωG and
ω2D as functions of electrode potential are shown
in Figure 1b. Each
point is the average of six locations with similar (ωG, ω2D) to reduce the influence of noise. The intensities
and FWHMs as a function of ϕ are shown in Figure S2. The ωG reached a minimum (∼1583
cm–1) at ∼0.1 V. The value of ω2D also reached a minimum (∼2685 cm–1) at 0.1 V in G/ITO. The value of ω2D increased
as the potential was elevated and hole doping was introduced into
graphene. This tendency was almost the same as that of ωG from 0.2 V. The value of dω2D/dωG was approximately 0.64. When the potential was lowered, i.e.,
the conditions of electron doping, the value of ω2D increased to a maximum at approximately −0.4 V and decreased
at more negative potentials. Our results are in accordance with the
literature,4,10,14 which showed contributions from nonadiabatic Kohn anomaly and quantum
interference.17 The electrochemical potential
of the minimum ωG, ϕ0Ag/AgCl ≈ 0.1 V, indicates the
electrochemical potential of the Dirac point of graphene, when its
charge density is 0. Note that we used a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
On the basis of the equation for the absolute potential, ϕ0vac = ϕ0NHE – 4.44
V, and ϕ0Ag/AgCl = ϕ0NHE – 0.197 V,28,29 the absolute potential of the
Dirac point referenced to the vacuum level, ϕ0vac, can be estimated to be −4.74
V.

Some parts of the graphene on the Cu particles (G/Cu particle)
were found on the G/ITO sample (see the Supporting Information Section 2 for details). Generally speaking, these
spots showed stronger Raman intensity and a small D band owing to
the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Cu particle.30 The (ωG, ω2D) distribution of the G/Cu particle was the same as that of the G/Cu
foil (Figure 2a, also
refer to Figure 3a).
The trajectories of (ωG, ω2D) for
charge-doped G/ITO and G/Cu particle in ωG–ω2D space are shown in Figure 2b. The vertices of the trajectory correspond to the
electrode potentials 0, 0.1, and 0.2 V, which have the minimum ωG. With heavier doping, (ωG, ω2D) moves toward the right side of the vertex because of a
large increase in ωG with a relatively small change
of ω2D. This result suggests that (ωG, ω2D) cannot migrate to the left side of the vertex,
when charge doping is the only factor that influences (ωG, ω2D). The shape of the trajectory of the
G/Cu particle was very similar to that of G/ITO. However, the trajectory
of the G/Cu particle was directed to the upper left compared with
that of G/ITO. This finding confirms that the G/ITO and G/Cu particles
are different in terms of their physical properties, besides their
charge density. These differences are likely caused by the substrate.
Meanwhile, the identical shape of the trajectories suggests that the
effects from the substrate are independent of those from the charge
density.

To discuss the effects
of the substrates, ω2D vs
ωG plots measured on different substrates in air
are shown in Figure 3a. Multiple locations on each sample were measured. For G/ITO, the
average FWHM of the G band was 17 cm–1, which suggests
that G/ITO is undoped in air. The (ωG, ω2D) of G/ITO were mainly located in the range of 1581 cm–1 < ωG < 1584 cm–1 and 2680 cm–1 < ω2D < 2687
cm–1. All of the (ωG, ω2D) values lie around a straight line with a slope of approximately
2.2, which is attributed to biaxial strain distribution of graphene.19 In this paper, we refer to this line as the
“strain line”. The (ωG, ω2D) of G/SiO2 showed a similar distribution to that
of G/ITO with a small blue-shift of the G band. The FWHM of the G
band was 13 cm–1 for G/SiO2. Therefore,
G/SiO2 was slightly charged. Some (ωG,
ω2D) values from references were also used, all of
which were measured under electrochemical control or gating and only
data of the zero-charge-density graphene were used.9−11,13,14 The (ωG, ω2D) values spread between the strain lines of
G/ITO and G/SiO2 but did not lie on a straight line. Therefore,
we assume that, if the measurements were all accurate, the discrepancy
among our results and the references cannot be explained by charge
doping or strain. Thus, we inferred that there is at least one other
factor that affects (ωG, ω2D).

This idea is further confirmed by the observations of the G/Au(111)
and G/Cu foil. The (ωG, ω2D) of
G/Au(111) showed good linearity with a slope of 2.2, such that this
tendency was attributed to the strain distribution. Both ωG and ω2D of G/Au(111) were higher than those
of G/ITO, suggesting a higher strain. However, the (ωG, ω2D) values of G/ITO and G/Au(111) did not lie
on the same strain line. The difference between the strain lines of
G/ITO and G/Au(111) cannot be explained by charge doping because G/ITO
is undoped and any doping should move (ωG, ω2D) toward the right rather than in the upper direction of
the ωG–ω2D plot. Although
the (ωG, ω2D) of G/Cu showed poorer
linearity, a strain dependence was still observable. The 2D band also
showed a blue-shift compared with that of G/ITO. Interestingly, if
graphene is transferred by the same method from G/Cu foil to another
Au or Cu substrate, the resulting (ωG, ω2D) values are very close to those of G/ITO and G/SiO2 (open circles and squares in Figure 3a). This result suggests that the interaction between
the graphene and its substrate is strongly dependent on the preparation
method. Only a high-temperature treatment, such as CVD can produce
a sufficient interaction strength to change Raman spectroscopy of
graphene.21,31 The Raman spectra of graphene during the
transfer process were also checked. A typical Raman spectrum of graphene
sandwiched by Cu foil and PMMA is shown in Figure S5, with clear peaks from both graphene and PMMA, as well as
photoluminescence from Cu. The distribution of (ωG, ω2D) of all of the intermediates during transfer
are shown in Figure 3b. We found that PMMA deposited on G/Cu foil does not change the
distribution of (ωG, ω2D). After
etching of the Cu foil, the ω2D decreased to the
same range as that of G/ITO. Attaching G/PMMA to ITO glass increased
both ωG and ω2D, likely because
of the strain from compression by PMMA as it was cooled. Nevertheless,
(ωG, ω2D) remained on the strain
line of the final G/ITO. All of these results infer that the strong
interaction between the graphene and metal substrates is the only
reason for the blue-shift of the strain line.

Because the strain
and charge doping cannot explain the strain
line shift in the ωG–ω2D plot,
at least another independent mechanism should be considered. It is
well known that the value of ωG is the iLO phonon
energy at the Γ point. The value of ω2D is
twice the iTO phonon energy near the K point. Theoretically,
ω2D depends on the Fermi velocity of graphene (vF), the energy of the iTO phonon at the K point (ωTO), and the slope of the iTO
phonon energy as a function of the wavevector near K point (vTO) (the Supporting Information Section 3 and Figure S6).

In addition to
strain and doping, we believe that dielectric screening
can also affect the electron and phonon properties of graphene. This
idea originates from the inconsistency between the two widely used
ab initio theoretical approaches, i.e., density functional theory
(DFT) and the GW approximation. It has been reported that DFT calculations
give a lower value of vF than that provided
by the GW approximation.32,33 The essential difference
between these approaches is that DFT adopts a single-electron approximation,
whereas the GW approximation involves multibody interactions (e.g.,
electron self-energy), which leads to a considerable modification
of the electronic structure of graphene.34 This multibody interaction depends on the dielectric constant (ε).
When ε increases, the Coulomb potential between the electrons
is lowered. In an extreme case, when ε is infinite, the multibody
interaction is completely screened and vF should resemble the DFT results.35 Notably,
the value of ε is that on the plane of graphene, which is not
the same as the value of ε of the substrate; however, ε
of graphene is influenced by that of the substrate. For example, the
charge carrier screening can be regarded as an increase in ε
from graphene owing to the free charge on it.33,34,36 A decrease in the value of vF of graphene by ε of the substrates has been proposed
by theory37 and confirmed by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy on dielectric substrates.38 Metals are considered to have considerably larger ε
values than normal dielectrics; hence, graphene on a metal substrate
should have weaker multibody interactions and a lower vF.

In terms of phonon properties, although there
have been no reported
GW calculations of ωG, a B3LYP approximation, which
also involves multibody interactions, showed a very slight red-shift
of the iLO phonon energy at Γ point (−0.4 cm–1) for graphene sandwiched by BN compared with that on a SiO2 substrate.31 The GW-predicted phonon
dispersion near the K point and ω2D were closer to
the experimental results, compared with the predictions by DFT.39,40 Weakening of the electron–phonon interactions of graphene
on Pt and Ir substrates has been reported.41,42 The screening on Cu substrates depends on the facet of Cu and the
orientation of graphene.43,44 Although dielectric
screening theoretically changes both electron and phonon properties,
the influence on phonon properties are smaller and less clear. Therefore,
at this stage, we only consider the influence of dielectric screening
on vF.

To fully describe the relationship
between ωph and vF, ωTO and vTO should also be estimated.
We use the values
of graphene on SiO2 from the reference, where vTO/vF = 5.47 × 10–3, ωTO = 1245 cm–1, and vF = 1.1 × 106 m
s–1.3 The plot of ω2D vs vF is shown in Figure 4. To evaluate vF of graphene on other substrates, the change in ω2D without the influence from strain and doping should be used.
First, the charge densities were assumed not to affect (ωG, ω2D) for all of the samples. This assumption
is based on the fact that for all of the samples, the FWHM of G band
was over 10 cm–1, which corresponds to the electrochemical
potential between 0 and 0.2 V (Figure S2). Within this range, the shift in the 2D band is less than 1 cm–1 (Figure 1b). Second, the ω2D of each sample was deducted
from the strain line where ωG = 1587.5 cm–1. Thus, the difference in strain was excluded. On the basis of these
assumptions, the vF of G/Au(111) was calculated
to be 0.95 × 106 m s–1. This value
is much smaller than that of G/SiO2 but larger than that
of the DFT prediction, 0.85 × 106 m s–1, owing to partial dielectric screening. On an average, the value
of vF on Cu was approximately 1.01 ×
106 m s–1. The value of 1.07 × 106 m s–1 for the vF of G/ITO was in good agreement with its semiconductor nature.

as a function of Fermi velocity. Error bars show
the range of 2D band energies and corresponding vF ranges of graphene. The blue circles show the hypothetical
value for G/SiO2.

Notably, the dielectric screening from the substrate depends
not
only on the ε of the substrate but also on the coupling between
the graphene and the substrate.45 The graphene–Au
and graphene–Cu interactions from the CVD preparation are not
sufficient to completely screen the multibody interactions.46−48 Furthermore, the distance between the graphene and the metal substrates
is strongly affected by the preparation method. The CVD grown graphene
on Au(111) has the simplest interface structure and idealized coupling,
such that the herring bone structure of Au(111) can be clearly observed
on G/Au(111) by scanning tunneling microscopy (Figure S7).49 Cu foil is polycrystalline,
such that a winkle-like structure appears owing to the shrinking of
Cu during cooling after CVD synthesis (Figure S8). The inhomogeneous graphene–Cu coupling results
in fluctuation of ω2D. If graphene was grown on the
substrates with overly strong interactions (e.g., lattice-matched
Ni and Co), the 2D band was absent owing to the bonding between the
carbon and metal atoms.50 On the other
hand, the transferred graphene does not have sufficient interactions
with the metal substrate. Interestingly, even physically pressing
a Au bead against graphene does not induce any changes in its Raman
spectrum (Figure S9). A possible reason
for this might be that some adsorbed molecule layers on graphene or
an oxidation layer on the metal hinder the interaction between graphene
and metal; however, these factors are excluded in CVD. Therefore,
we suggest that only an interaction between graphene and metal of
sufficient strength can enable dielectric screening to take place.
The CVD synthesis of graphene on metals produces an appropriate interaction
to enable screening.

Conclusions
In this paper, we show
that ωG and ω2D of graphene are
affected by not only the strain and charge
doping, but also the electronic interactions between graphene and
its substrates. Electronic interactions between graphene and the metal
substrate can be clearly observed when graphene is grown on Au(111)
and Cu foils by CVD. We explain the electronic interactions between
graphene and its substrates by dielectric screening theory, which
is in accordance with the existing theoretical predictions and our
experimental results. The Fermi velocity of graphene is considerably
reduced owing to the dielectric screening from the metal substrate,
resulting in a blue-shift of the 2D band in the Raman spectrum. This
dielectric screening can only be observed when the interaction is
sufficiently strong, such as that between graphene and the metal via
in situ CVD. Finally, the vF of graphene
on a specific sample can be evaluated by Raman spectroscopy with our
mathematical model. Our study provides a new way to examine and understand
the interactions of 1- and 2-D materials with their substrate in nanocomposite
materials.

Experimental Section
Graphene was synthesized on the
Cu foil (0.025 mm, 99.999%, Alfa
Aesar) by CVD and transferred to other substrates based on the reported
methods.51,52 In a typical process, the copper foil was
washed with acetone sonication and SiO2 and ITO glass were
washed with a hot mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3. A piece of Cu foil (12 mm × 12 mm) was heated in a
tube furnace from room temperature to 1000 °C in 30 min under
a flow of Ar (50 sccm) and H2 (200 sccm). This foil was
maintained at 1000 °C for 10 min under a flow of Ar (1000 sccm),
H2 (20 sccm), and CH4 (0.36 sccm). The synthesized
G/Cu foil was then cooled to room temperature in the Ar flow. G/Au(111)
was synthesized by a previously reported method.49 To transfer the graphene, first, 50 μL of 2% PMMA
in toluene was dropped on to the G/Cu foil. The toluene was evaporated
at 60 °C. The PMMA/G/Cu was then floated on 20 mL of 0.1 M (NH4)2S2O8 solution, with the
Cu side facing down until the foil was completely dissolved. The PMMA/G
was then washed with deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) and dried
at room temperature. It was then placed on the target substrates with
the graphene side downward. The substrate was then heated on a hot
plate to 100 °C until the G/PMMA completely adhered to the substrate.
After cooling to room temperature, the PMMA was removed by washing
with acetone twice.

In an EC-Raman measurement, the G/ITO was
used as the working electrode
in an electrochemical cell with Pt foil and Ag/AgCl (saturated aq
KCl) as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.53,54 The electrolyte was a buffer solution of 0.075 M NaH2PO4 + 0.1 M H3PO4 with pH of 2.
The Raman spectra were collected on a Nanofiner 30, whereas the potential
was controlled with a potentiostat. A 514 nm laser was used and the
power was set at 1.5 mW for all of the measurements, which were conducted
over 120 s.
