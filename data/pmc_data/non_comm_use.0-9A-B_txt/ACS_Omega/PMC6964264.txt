The Collaborative Materials Exercise (CMX) is organized by the
Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group, with the
aim of advancing the analytical capabilities of the participating
organizations and providing feedback on the best approaches to a nuclear
forensic investigation. Here, model nuclear fuel materials from the
5th CMX iteration were analyzed using a NanoSIMS 50L (CAMECA)
in order to examine inhomogeneities in the 235U/238U ratio and trace element abundance within individual, micrometer
scale particles. Two fuel pellets were manufactured for the exercise
and labelled CMX-5A and CMX-5B. These pellets were created using different
processing techniques, but both had a target enrichment value of 235U/238U = 0.01. Particles from these pellets were
isolated for isotopic and trace element analysis. Fifteen CMX-5A particles
and 20 CMX-5B particles were analyzed, with both sample types displaying
inhomogeneities in the U isotopic composition at a sub-micrometer
scale within individual particles. Typical particle diameters were
∼1.5 to 41 μm for CMX-5A and ∼1 to 61 μm
for CMX-5B. The CMX-5A particles were shown to be more isotopically
homogeneous, with a mean 235U/238U atom ratio
of 0.0130 ± 0.0066. The CMX-5B particles showed a predominantly
depleted mean 235U/238U atom ratio of 0.0063
± 0.0094, which is significantly different to the target enrichment
value of the pellet and highlights the potential variation of 235U/238U in U fuel pellets at the micrometer scale.
This study details the successful application of the NanoSIMS 50L
in a mock nuclear forensic investigation by optimizing high-resolution
imaging for uranium isotopics.

1 Introduction
Nuclear forensic science focuses on the analysis of nuclear and/or
radioactive materials found outside of regulatory control.1,2 By characterizing the chemical and isotopic signatures of a sample,
inferences about the material’s source, processing history,
and intended use can be drawn. Such information is often vital in
the context of nuclear security and law enforcement investigations.2−4

Radioactive particles are an invaluable resource for nuclear forensic
investigations as fine particulates and dusts are typically present
following the handling of radioactive or nuclear materials.5 Particulate fragments of source materials can
yield valuable isotopic and chemical information on the sub-micrometer
scale, thereby providing a characteristic “fingerprint”
of the parent material.6 Furthermore, particulates
can also provide a mechanistic insight into their release and formation
conditions following nuclear accidents, information that is vital
for site remediation/decommissioning strategies and damage assessments.6 However, the analysis of such particles can often
be extremely challenging, especially given their size, limited volume,
complex isotopic and elemental composition, and multiple phase distributions.7,8 Indeed, elucidating chemical heterogeneities/homogeneities over
a range of scales is a valuable characterization tool for samples
of limited quantities. The development of an analytical toolkit capable
of examining the microstructural, isotopic, and elemental composition
of individual particles is therefore essential for advanced nuclear
forensic investigations.2,9

Mass spectrometry is a fundamental technique in nuclear forensics,
allowing for the determination of elemental, molecular, and isotopic
information across a diverse range of materials.10 Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) has already proven
to be successful for single particle investigations, with specific
applications in the characterization of micrometer-sized, uranium
(U)-bearing samples with high spatial resolution and high mass resolution.1,11−13 The CAMECA NanoSIMS 50L offers the high mass resolution
and sensitivity of other SIMS methods, with a unique primary ion beam
configuration that allows for high-spatial-resolution analysis. Indeed,
a lateral resolution of ∼50 nm is achievable for both negative
and positive secondary ions (using Cs+ or Hyperion primary
ion beam).14 This increased spatial resolution
allows for the detailed analysis of individual microparticles, revealing
subtle differences in isotopic ratios and elemental composition at
the nanometer scale.15 This is particularly
useful for nuclear forensic investigations where the scale of analysis
can be a crucial factor in determining the enrichment and processing
history of a material used as evidence for origin assessment.9,16 Prior to the development of nanoscale SIMS (NanoSIMS) techniques,
“bulk” isotopic ratios (those determined via conventional
SIMS or radiochemical analyses) were typically expressed as an average
for an individual microparticle (or number of particles). Indeed,
conventional SIMS techniques provide a lateral resolution of several
micrometers, meaning submicrometer variations in isotopic or chemical
composition within individual particles cannot usually be observed.17 As such, vital information on a material’s
processing history and origin can often be lost with bulk-scale analysis
techniques. Thus, NanoSIMS is emerging as a vital technique in nuclear
forensics, with the capability of discerning variations in isotopic
content at the micrometer scale.15

The Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (ITWG)
Collaborative Materials Exercises (CMXs) have been running since 1999,
with the fifth exercise (CMX-5) commencing in 2015/2016.18 The purpose of these exercises is to simulate
the real-life discovery and subsequent investigation of a nuclear
material of unknown origin, using materials representative of those
under regulatory control (i.e., uranium and plutonium oxides/metals).19 The exercises provide a platform for determining
the best practices for nuclear forensic laboratories while also allowing
for the assessment of new experimental techniques. For U-bearing particles, 235U enrichment is used as an indicator in determining anthropogenic
processing and the fissile content of a material (and thereby its
intended use) as natural U contains 234U, 235U, and 238U in relative atomic abundances of 0.005, 0.72,
and 99.27%, respectively.

For the CMX-5 exercise, which concluded in 2017, the participating
institutions were each sent two low-enriched UO2 fuel pellets,
a specification sheet for a third theoretical fuel pellet, and a fictional
description of the “find”. The two fuel pellets, labelled
CMX-5A and CMX-5B, were produced by the French Alternative Energies
and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA, Cadarache, France), using identical
feedstock mixtures of depleted uranium (DU) (UO2, 235U = 0.3 atom %) and low-enriched uranium (LEU) (UO2, 235U = 4.3 atom %) to give a final target enrichment
value of 235U/238U = 0.01.20 Although the same feedstocks were used, different sintering
techniques and compaction pressures were employed for the two pellet
types, resulting in a very different macrostructure between them.20 The method used to create the CMX-5A pellet
is representative of AREVA’s manufacturing process for PWR
fuel, termed the “normal double cycle” route.20,21 Here, source materials are combined before undergoing a series of
grinding/compaction steps. This route has an initial low-pressure
compaction (50 MPa) followed by a high-pressure formatting compaction
(450 MPa).20 CMX-5B was created using the
“inverse double cycle” method where a dense fuel mixture
is achieved by applying a high pressure to the source materials followed
by crushing/sieving and then a second low-pressure compaction.20 This method was developed in order to create
large, stable pores in the fuel material as a means of preventing
fuel densification upon irradiation.22

Here, swipe samples containing micrometer-sized particles from
the two fuel pellets (CMX-5A and CMX-5B) were analyzed using a NanoSIMS
50L in order to investigate the spatial distribution of isotopic and
trace element signatures within individual particles and relate the
findings to the material’s provenance and processing history.
It was hypothesized that the NanoSIMS 50L could be employed to understand
the differences in the manufacturing processes used for the two CMX-5
fuel pellets, with wider applicability in the field of nuclear forensic
science and particulate characterization. This research also provides
a useful comparison to other techniques used in CMX-5, especially
other SIMS techniques optimized for high-precision isotopic analysis.
Using NanoSIMS, inhomogeneities in U isotopics were identified in
individual particles from the CMX-5A and CMX-5B pellets, giving forensic
insight into the starting materials used in their production.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectroscopy
Several CMX-5A and CMX-5B particles were
analyzed with scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) to give a semiquantitative elemental
composition. Both CMX-5A and CMX-5B displayed similar elemental profiles,
with U being the major component (Figures S1 and S2). Minor trace elements (Al, Si, and Na) were also detected
in both 5A and 5B particles. EDX spectra and associated images are
presented in the Supporting Information, section 1.

Alumina was added to both the CMX-5A and CMX-5B pellets during fabrication;
however, for CMX-5B, this additive was only introduced to the DU fraction,
which was later combined with the LEU source in a soft mix.20 Here, EDX imaging showed that Al was homogeneously
dispersed throughout several particles from both the CMX-5A and CMX-5B
swipes. Several particles from both samples also contained spherical
Al inclusions, co-located with an increased O signal and a decreased
U signal (Figure S3). However, no discernible
differences were evident in the Al content of the two pellet types
based on EDX analysis. One CMX-5A particle exhibited a more varied
elemental profile, containing trace amounts of Na, Mg, Al, Si, S,
Ca, Cr, Fe, and Cu; however, this was the only particle that exhibited
such heterogeneity (Figure S1).

Particles of CMX-5A and CMX-5B displayed comparable morphologies,
containing small spherical pores (<500 nm) and some larger voids
(>1 μm). The frequency of pores per unit area was investigated
using a subset of 13 CMX-5A and 13 CMX-5B particles. The CMX-5A particles
appeared to be more porous than the CMX-5B materials, giving an average
of 0.162 ± 0.091 and 0.109 ± 0.097 pores/μm2, respectively. The measurements for the particles are given in more
detail in the Supporting Information (section 2, Table S1).

2.2 NanoSIMS Imaging
2.2.1 Uranium Isotope Calibrations
Isotopic
ratio analysis employed a combination of 235U/238U, 235U16O/238U16O, and 235U16O2/238U16O2 species. A particle surface average (PSA) is presented
for each CMX particle analyzed, denoting the mean isotopic ratio from
the surficial layers sputtered by the NanoSIMS beam. PSAs were calculated
by applying a 25% threshold to the 238U+ secondary
ion image intensity to remove the background signal, thereby creating
a region of interest (ROI) around each particle. The PSA does not
represent the “whole” particle average as this would
require complete destructive sputtering of each particle. This averaging
was also applied for the assessment of the isotopic calibration materials.

Repeat analyses of the isotopic ratios were acquired to determine
whether there were any variations when measuring the 235U/238U, 235UO/238UO, or 235UO2/238UO2. The measurement of oxide
species to determine atom ratios is a common method in NanoSIMS analysis
as the oxide is cancelled out when ratioing the secondary ion images.23 The UO+ and UO2+ secondary ion species were chosen because they provided a significant
increase in the secondary ion signal yield relative to U+. This improvement in counting statistics yielded higher-resolution
images, particularly for the low abundance U isotopes (234U and 235U). Images obtained from these repeats showed
that the U+, UO+, and UO2+ signals exhibited the same spatial distribution within the particles
and that ratio values for the different species are in good agreement,
as shown by the PSA values in Table 1. For the purposes of this study, the UO and UO2+ species are assumed to accurately represent the 234/235U/238U atomic ratios. As such, the ratios
of all species are expressed as the atomic values (234U/238U and 235U/238U) throughout this study,
unless otherwise specified.

a Errors for the true isotopic ratios
of the CRM U630 are expressed as expanded uncertainty at a 95% confidence
interval. The uncertainty in the measured values is based on Poisson
counting statistics.

The 234U/238U and 234UO2/238UO2 species were measured for several particles,
but the 234UO+ signal was not used due to an
isobaric interference of 238U12C+ with 234U16O+. For 234UO2/238UO2, the 238U12C+ content was also examined but this either gave
counts below background or did not correlate spatially with the bulk
U signal; thus, the probability of forming 238U12C16O+ compared to 234U16O2+ was found to be very low and did not represent
a significant interference. An unresolvable mass interference is expected
between the 235U+ and 234U1H+ species. However, hydride contributions are typically
lower than the atomic signal during SIMS analysis, and 234U1H+ interferences are expected to contribute
less than 0.01% to the 235U+ signal.24 Here, 238U1H+ was measured from the mass spectrum of a CMX-5A particle and was
shown to equal ∼0.55% of the 238U+ signal,
which would equate to <1 count for the 234U1H+, or <0.01% of the 235U+ signal.
Thus, the 234U1H+ interference was
deemed to be negligible for this study (see the Supporting Information, section 3, Figure S4).

The measured ratios and their certified values for the calibration
materials are provided in Table 1. The statistical errors for the calibrants were low
(<0.3%), but there were some systematic differences from the true
values, likely resulting from instrumental fractionation. However,
these differences amounted to <3% in the measured ratio and therefore
have no bearing on the isotopic ratio values determined for the CMX
samples. High-resolution imaging reduces the count rate for secondary
ion images that can impact the precision of isotopic ratio values.
Thus, the NanoSIMS 50L is complementary to other techniques that have
a low spatial resolution but are optimized for high-precision isotopic
analysis, such as large-geometry SIMS (LG-SIMS).

2.3 Trends in Uranium Isotopic Ratios
A total of 35 particles were analyzed by NanoSIMS: 15 from CMX-5A
and 20 from CMX-5B, yielding mean 235U/238U
atom ratios (summed from PSAs) of 0.0130 (± 0.0066) and 0.0063
(± 0.0094), respectively. An overview of the 235U/238U PSAs for each particle analyzed is presented in Figure 1. This gives a more
direct comparison with the isotopic data provided by the manufacturers
and the other participating laboratories in the CMX-5 exercise. However,
it should be noted that NanoSIMS is a surface probe technique, and
the data presented here is not from the destructive sputtering of
the whole particle. Particle sizes ranged in diameter from ∼1.5
to 41 μm for CMX-5A and from ∼1 to 61 μm for CMX-5B,
and no correlation between particle size and enrichment was identified.

ratios for each subset of particles are indicated by the solid line.
The manufacturer target enrichment value (1% 235U) is shown by the dashed line. Errors are contained within the data
points. The arrows indicate the particles that have been presented
in Figures 2–5. Particle numbers were
assigned based on the analysis order.

The CEA has provided definitive enrichment values for the pellets
of 1.0063 ± 0.0009 for CMX-5A and 1.0158 ± 0.0232 for CMX-5B.26,27 It has also been reported that the CMX-5B pellet had a more heterogeneous
isotopic composition than CMX-5A.20,26,27 Several of the CMX-5A particles analyzed in this
study gave PSA ratio values centered around the target enrichment
value (235U/238U = 0.01); however, it is evident
that there is a wide range of enrichment values across the 15 individual
particles analyzed (235U/238U ≈ 0.006–0.033).
This is also the case for the CMX-5B particles, which had PSA 235U/238U atom ratios ranging from ∼0.0025
to 0.0470. However, unlike CMX-5A, the mean PSA 235U/238U determined by NanoSIMS for the CMX-5B particles was significantly
different from the value quoted by the CEA. Here, the majority of
the CMX-5B particles had a depleted 235U content, yet the
mean PSA for all particles is raised by the presence of a single LEU
particle with an outlying 235U/238U atom ratio
of 0.0473 ± 0.0001.

Detailed nanoscale imaging was obtained for all particles. Two
particles from CMX-5A (CMX-5A-8 and CMX-5A-15) and two from CMX-5B
(CMX-5A-10 and CMX-5A-18) were selected for presentation herein (as
denoted by arrows in Figure 1). These particles were chosen as they were either deemed
representative of the dataset, were measured with different isotopic
pairs, or, in the example of CMX-5A-18, represented an extreme outlier.

2.3.1 CMX-5A
NanoSIMS imaging revealed
an inhomogeneous 235U/238U distribution at a
micrometer scale within individual CMX-5A particles. Particle CMX-5A-8
is shown in Figure 2 and is approximately 98 μm2 (16 μm diameter). This particle exhibited a 235U/238U PSA of 0.01346 (± 0.00003) although it is
evident from the 235U16O+ and 238U16O+ secondary ion images (Figure 2A,B) that there is
an inhomogeneous distribution of these isotopes. Three discrete areas
of 235U enrichment can be discerned from the ratio image
map (Figure 2C). A
broad area (∼8 μm in length) of relatively high enrichment
(235U/238U ≈ 0.040) is located toward
the top of the particle, with a well-defined boundary, directly neighboring
a region of DU (235U/238U ≈ 0.003). Both
values correspond well to the specified enrichments of the two starting
materials, suggesting incomplete mixing in broad regions (micrometer
scale) of the fuel pellet. A third group of values, comprising the
largest area within the particle by pixel frequency (Figure 2C), gave a range of enrichments
closer to the target value (235U/238U = 0.01).
The variation in enrichment values across the length of the particle
is shown as a line profile (14 × 0.7 μm) in Figure 2G, giving the 235U/238U ratio in 350 nm steps (for an approximately 300
nm beam). This particle contained a number of Al inclusions, also
observed with SEM–EDX and depicted in the RGB image in Figure 2D; however, no spatial
correlations could be found between these signals and the variability
in the U isotopic ratios.

(F) are indicated by a white box in panel (A). (G) Line profile from
the ratio image. The ratio images were smoothed to match the beam
diameter, which was ∼300 nm.

A 5 × 5 μm analysis window (Figure 2E,F) was also used to examine the 235U/238U ratio over the boundary region of incomplete mixing,
denoted by the box in Figure 2A. The 235U/238U ratios were 0.0422
± 0.0002 and 0.0044 ± 0.0001 for ROIs 1 and 2, respectively. 234U+ was also analyzed in this region (as 234U16O2+), displaying a heterogeneous
spatial distribution consistent with 235U enrichment; that
is, heightened 234U+ signals are associated
with heightened 235U+ signals. This is to be
expected as light U isotopes are often separated together during enrichment
processes.28 The 234U/238U atom ratio ranged from 0.000357 ± 0.000023 in the enriched
area (Figure 2F, ROI
1) to 0.000019 ± 0.000005 in the depleted area (Figure 2F, ROI 2). Isotopic analysis
performed by the other participating laboratories showed the 234U/238U atom ratio for the CMX-5A pellet to range
from ∼0.000072 to 0.000105, with the corresponding 235U/238U ratio ranging from ∼0.00980 to 0.01050.20

Isotopic images from CMX-5A-15 are shown in Figure 3. This particle is nearly 15× larger
than CMX-5A-8 and is the largest CMX-5A particle analyzed (1415 μm2), exhibiting a 235U/238U PSA of 0.0130
± 0.0001. As with CMX-5A-8, this particle also contained discrete
areas of variable 235U enrichment, away from the target
mixing value (235U/238U = 0.01), with the greatest 235U/238U atom ratio being 0.0352 ± 0.0005
(ROI 2, Figure 3D).
Here, the enriched areas are present as small (∼0.5 to 4 μm
diameter) subspherical inclusions, sporadically dispersed throughout
the particle. Regions with a depleted 235U/238U atom ratio were also observed, but unlike the particle shown in Figure 2 (CMX-5A-8), these
ratios did not correlate with the depleted source material. Indeed,
the lowest 235U/238U ratio was 0.0042 ±
0.0002, taken from ROI 1 in Figure 3D.

ratio value indicated by the color scale.

2.3.2 CMX-5B
The target enrichment value
for CMX-5B was 235U/238U = 0.01. In this study,
only 1 CMX-5B particle out of the analyzed 20 displayed a 235U/238U PSA atom ratio above 0.008. This particle, CMX-5B-18,
is shown in Figure 4 (∼567 μm2) and has a 235U/238U atom ratio of 0.0473 ± 0.0001. The ratio image reveals
heterogeneity in the 235U/238U ratio across
the central region of the particle, ranging from ∼0.040 to
0.055 (Figure 4C).
However, the variability in U isotope ratios is less pronounced than
within the CMX-5A samples (∼0.003 to 0.040). Indeed, there
is no evidence within this large particle for broad regions matching
the expected DU source value (∼0.3% 235U). This
particle may therefore be representative of the LEU starting material
for the pellets, prior to mixing with DU. According to the CEA, the
LEU source material used in the fuel pellets was itself created by
mixing two discrete sources: one containing 4.2% 235U (235U/U = 0.045) at 67 wt % and another containing 4.5% 235U (235U/U = 0.045) at 33 wt %.20 This variability in the isotopics of the source material
could partly explain the inhomogeneity in the 235U/238U ratio across the main particle analyzed here; however,
this does not account for the increased enrichment values of 235U/238U ≈ 0.055.

six particles marked. (E) 235U16O+/238U16O+ ratios for the ROIs shown in panels (C) and

images from a 15 × 15 μm field of view, indicated by the
white box in panel (A).

The 234U/238U and 235U/238U atom ratios were also measured across a 10 × 10 μm area
of the large particle using the UO2+ signals,
giving PSAs of 3.38 × 10–4 (± 3.00 ×
10–6) and 0.0540 (± 0.0001), respectively (Figure 4F). Interestingly,
this 234U/238U ratio correlates with that measured
from the LEU region within the CMX-5A particle shown in Figure 2. However, the 235U enrichment is greater than that reported by the CEA and is an unexplained
anomaly. The bulk 234U/238U atom ratio for CMX-5B
reported by other participants in the exercise ranged from ∼0.00006
to 0.00011, and the 235U/238U ratio ranged from
∼0.0083 to 0.0115.20

In addition to the large, low-enriched particle, six individual
smaller particles were also observed in this field of view, all of
which displayed isotopic ratios close to the target for the pellet
of 0.01 235U/238U (Figure 4D,E). These fragments are wholly separate
from the main particle and are also observable in the SEM image, highlighted
by arrows in Figure 4C,D, with the ratios for the different ROIs given in Figure 4E.

Particle CMX-5B-10 (2956 μm2) is shown in Figure 5 and has a PSA 235U/238U atom ratio
of 0.0041 (± 0.0001). As with the prior examples, the presence
of submicrometer-sized areas with elevated 235U/238U ratios is evidence for incomplete mixing of the source materials.
A high-resolution analysis over a 30 μm2 field of
view shows that a range of 235U enrichments exists between
these discrete areas, spanning from 0.0083 (± 0.0010) to 0.0357
(± 0.0014) (Figure 5D,E).

CMX-5B-10 particle, with a white dashed box indicating a 30 ×

ratio values for these ROIs. (F) RGB map for 27Al+, 235U+, and 238U+.

Interestingly, an elevated 27Al+ signal is
distributed along individual grain boundaries within this particle
(Figure 5F). Further,
small (<1 μm) areas enriched in 235U appear to
lie either along these grain boundaries or at triple junctions between
grains. However, since this is the only particle where this was observed,
it is difficult to assess any trends between Al and U isotope distribution.

In this study, particles from the CMX-5B pellets were shown to
be more isotopically heterogeneous than those from CMX-5A. Upon conclusion
of the exercise, the CEA revealed that the feedstocks used to create
the CMX-5B pellets were kept separate during the initial compaction
before being recombined in a soft mix. It is therefore likely that
the two source materials used for the CMX-5B pellets were not homogeneously
dispersed before final compaction and sintering.

The mean 235U/238U PSAs for all CMX-5B particles
(0.0063 ± 0.0094) was significantly different from that described
by the target manufacturer (∼0.01). Of the 20 particles analyzed,
90% had a PSA in the DU range, while just 2% matched the LEU source.
LG-SIMS results from another laboratory participating in the exercise
also found two discrete groups of particles from the CMX-5B pellet
from a larger sample set (∼1000 particles), with ∼90%
being DU and ∼10% being LEU, giving an overall enrichment of
∼1% 235U.20 Here, the
limited sample set of 20 particles may not reflect the average enrichment
of the whole CMX-5B pellet; however, it is evident that the isotopic
variation at the micrometer scale contains information on the source
materials used in the pellet fabrication. NanoSIMS is the only technique
that has been able to spatially resolve and image these constituent
source materials on a sub-micrometer scale within individual particles.

SIMS techniques were used by several of the CMX-5 participant laboratories
to characterize the two fuel pellet types.20 The results presented from these different techniques were in broad
agreement with the isotopic information released by the CEA, with
average isotopic ratios representative of the target 235U/238U = 0.01. The high throughput of LG-SIMS makes this
technique complementary to NanoSIMS, especially in the examination
of data biasing from a small sample set. There is also the potential
to analyze a greater number of particles with NanoSIMS by employing
automated screening software (i.e., CAMECA Automated Particle Measurement
Software), but this was not available for this study.

3 Conclusions
This work highlights the suitability of the NanoSIMS 50L for nuclear
forensic investigations, particularly in the determination of variable
U isotopic ratios within individual, micrometer scale particles.
Particles from both the CMX-5A and CMX-5B exercise materials were
shown to contain inhomogeneous 235U/238U ratios
on a sub-micrometer scale using a NanoSIMS 50L, allowing novel insights
into the sources and processing histories of the individual fuel pellets
to be obtained.

It is difficult to compare the isotopic information determined
by NanoSIMS measurements with those gained from complete destructive
analysis (i.e., the consumption of a whole particle performed with
LG-SIMS) as NanoSIMS is a surface probe technique. This means that
only a few atomic layers of material are removed during a NanoSIMS
imaging analysis23 and, as the isotopic
and chemical composition of a particle may change with depth, the
bulk ratio of the particle may be different to that observed at the
surface. However, conventional SIMS methods that require a large primary
ion beam size (i.e., greater than that of the particle) or more traditional
radiochemical techniques (i.e., spectrometry, wet chemical methods)
are not capable of discerning subtle isotopic and elemental disparities
within an individual particle. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated
that by averaging the isotopic ratios across individual particles,
detailed information on the initial source materials is lost due to
the scale of analysis. NanoSIMS 50L provides a means of analyzing
U oxide fuel characteristics at the single particle level, making
it a valuable asset in the nuclear forensic toolkit.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Sample Preparation for NanoSIMS
Particles
from each fuel pellet (CMX-5A and CMX-5B) were transferred onto separate
filter paper swipes. Individual particles were then removed from the
filter paper using ultrafine point tweezers under an optical microscope.
These were transferred onto clean glass slides before being pressed
into indium foil (99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich 357,294) using a vice
press. The indium sections were secured onto 10 mm aluminum mounts
using Torr Seal low vapor pressure epoxy.

Calibration materials
were embedded in Araldite 502 epoxy resin in 10 mm diameter embedding
rings made from a Ni–Cu alloy. Resin-embedded samples were
ground with sequentially increasing grades of SiC grinding paper (800–2000
grit) and then polished using alumina suspensions (6, 3, 1, and 0.1
μm) (Ted Pella, Inc., USA). All samples were Pt-coated (10 nm)
and stored in polypropylene containers inside a desiccator cabinet
prior to analysis. Trace element mass positions and secondary ion
yields were calibrated using metallic Al, Fe, Cu, and Cr; Mg as MgSO4; and Si from a silicon wafer. These materials were contained
within a single holder. A second holder contained a natural U mineral
(uranophane), and a third contained a Certified Reference Material
(CRM U630, New Brunswick Laboratory, USA).25 Radioactive materials were handled with guidance from The University
of Manchester Radiation Safety Unit.

4.2 NanoSIMS 50L
SIMS analyses were completed
with a NanoSIMS 50L (CAMECA, France) at The University of Manchester
over three analysis sessions. The first session was performed using
a duoplasmatron, which was subsequently replaced with a Hyperion II
(H201) radio frequency plasma source (Oregon Physics, USA) for the
remaining sessions. Details on the differences in spatial resolution
between the two primary ion sources can be found in the Supporting
Information (section 4, Figure S5). A 16 keV O– primary ion beam with a current of 4.4–17.8 pA for the Hyperion
II and 10.1–19.3 pA for the duoplasmatron was used to generate
positive secondary ion images. Presputtering/implantation with a high
current beam was used at a dose of ∼1.4 × 10–17 ions/cm2 prior to analysis in order to remove the Pt
coating and increase the secondary ion yield. The multicollection
detector array on the NanoSIMS 50L permits the simultaneous detection
of seven ionic species. Six of the detectors are mobile, and the seventh
is in a fixed position. The detectors were aligned and optimized for
the chosen masses, which were varied for the different experimental
sessions (see the Supporting Information, section 5). The NanoSIMS
50L allows the simultaneous multicollection of masses with one unit
mass spacing up to m/z 58; thus, 235U+ and 238U+ must be analyzed
using alternating magnetic fields, or peak-switching, with collection
on a single detector. Several acquisitions also included the simultaneous
detection of 234U+ with 238U+, which was achieved by placing the 234U+ on a different detector. Details of the various detector alignments
and beam parameters are specified in the Supporting Information (section
5, Table S2). A dwell time of 5000 μs/pixel
was used for 235U+, and 2000 μs/pixel
was used for all other masses. When 234U+ was
included, a dwell time of 5000 μs/pixel was used across all
detectors. All images were taken with a pixel resolution of 256 ×
256 pixels, and the entrance and aperture slits were kept at 20 (ES-3)
and 150 μm (AS-2), respectively. A minimum of five image planes
were acquired for each particle, but the total number of image planes
varied depending on the particle size and count rate. Images were
dead-time-corrected (44 ns), summed, and lateral-drift-corrected.
This data was processed offline using L’IMAGE software (Larry
Nittler, Carnegie Institute, USA),29 and
ratio errors were calculated using a Poisson distribution of the secondary
ions. Secondary ion images are presented as color maps with an arbitrary
intensity scale, which is different for each ion species. Ratio images
were generated by pixel smoothing using a width representative of
the beam size (Table S2).

4.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectroscopy
The SEM images were collected using an
FEI Quanta 650 at 10 keV. Images were coupled with EDX to identify
and map the elemental composition across individual CMX-5 particles.
These samples were prepared using the method described for NanoSIMS
sample preparation or by pressing particles on to an adhesive carbon
pad (10 mm) on a 12 mm aluminum stub.
