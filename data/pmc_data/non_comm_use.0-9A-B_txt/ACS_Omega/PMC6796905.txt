Large-area paper batteries have been
explored in this paper, correlating electrode materials and screen
printing with the electrochemical performances. The use of office
paper embedded in salt solution with two electrodes performed by an
easy and large-scale application technique opens doors to a new concept
of energy storage. The proposed device is Li-free and uses zinc and
silver powder-based screen printable pastes to deposit the electrodes.
Cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge curves reveal the performance
of the produced devices using NaCl and KOH solutions in different
concentrations. The simulation of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
measurements gave clue of a similar working mechanism to conventional
Li-ion batteries. After charging, a single paper battery achieves
1.83 V with 60 mA/cm2 and 90.6% charge–discharge
efficiency. As a proof of concept, a small paper battery and a set
integrated in series and parallel were used to power a commercial
red light-emitting diode.

Introduction
Over the years, printing
technologies have emerged as a possibility
to perform flexible electronics, meaning that the devices produced
are bendable, with conformal shape, lightweight, elastic, nonbreakable,
and roll-to-roll manufactured over small or large area.1−3

Flexible electronics have been applied in several wearable
devices,
flexible energy storage and conversion, sensors, displays, organic
light-emitting diodes (LEDs), antennas, and transistors.4−6 Expensive and time-consuming processes such as spin coating, sputtering,
thermal evaporation, and other clean room techniques have been used
to deposit the conductive electrodes to those applications. However,
when using substrates such as paper, plastics or textiles and printing
techniques such as ink-jet printing, screen printing, flexographic
printing, and gravure printing are more suitable for rugged and flexible
substrates and in the use of roll-to-roll machinery, which enables
high-speed and low-cost fabrication processes of flexible devices.7−10

The search for new processes and scalability of batteries
using
low-cost procedures and low environmental impact materials leads researchers
to find some new solutions. Among those, paper batteries have become
a fulfilled challenge.7 The use of paper
as a substrate or as the active layer in electronic devices such as
transistors, disposal diagnostic devices, and electrical energy storage
devices has already been proved.8,11−14 The paper is formed by cellulose-based fiber and has a high superficial
area, ability to wick fluids via capillary action, and strong adhesion
to a variety of materials.15 Two of the
most frequently used printing techniques for depositing a layer of
material on top of the paper surface are ink-jet and screen printing,
but specific inks with appropriate viscosity and surface tension are
required.7,16−19

Most of the state-of-the-art
printed batteries are either Li-ion
batteries or Zn/MnO2. Printed batteries offer many different
attributes and features such as their thin thickness, flexibility,
low cost and fast fabrication, simple processing, and reproducibility
in multiple geometries.19,20 Stacked and coplanar
are the most common architectures, while sealing is required to protect
them against degradation due to humidity or other environmental agents.

Paper or paper-based composites have already been used as the substrate
on printed Li-ion, Zn/MnO2, Al/air, and Zn/air batteries
or bacteria-powered batteries for fast diagnostic devices.7,8,19,21,22 Batteries, where commercial paper sheet
accumulates the functions of the substrate and a porous separator
between the electrodes, were demonstrated. In this case, thermal evaporation
deposited the cathode and anode, copper and aluminum, respectively,
while air humidity (water vapor) was used as the electrolyte. A self-rechargeable
device is able to supply 0.6 V, and each cell was integrated into
series to provide enough power to open and close the gate of a field-effect
transistor.13,14

In the present work, a
paper-based battery with silver- and zinc-printed
electrodes is presented. The influence of electrode materials, the
electrolyte composition, and screen printing processes for the paper-based
batteries fabrication were studied and optimized.

Results and Discussion
The Ag/paper/Zn-Ag paper asymmetric structure was achieved by applying
the Ag ink in one side of the paper (3.75 mg/cm2) and Zn
ink in the opposite side (3.92 mg/cm2), followed by the
application of Ag ink (2.70 mg/cm2), as shown in Figure 1. Ag acts as a current
collector while the Zn layer as the intermediate accumulation surface
(active layer). The conductivities of Ag and Zn layers are, respectively,
0.18 and 1.15 × 10–10 (Ω·cm)−1. SEM cross-sectional imaging was used to measure
the thickness of both electrodes, 22 ± 6 and 37 ± 5 μm
for Ag and Ag-Zn, respectively.

structure, Ag/paper/Zn-Ag
cells. (b) 9 × 5.5 cm2 cell produced
via bar coating. (c) Screen-printed 2 × 2 cm2 cell.

To study the influence of electrolyte,
the paper was soaked with
different salt solutions followed by an encapsulation step. The maximum
open circuit potential (OCP) of a single Ag/paper/Zn-Ag cell for 1
and 5 M NaCl is 0.85 V while for 1, 5, and 10 M KOH, it is 0.9, 1.11,
and 1.14 V respectively. Figure S1 and Table S1 compare the 10th cycle from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) plot for
each solution tested at a scanning rate of 80 mV/s. Clearly, the cell
with paper soaked in 5 M KOH revealed +60.7 and – 79.7 mA/cm2 current densities for anodic and cathodic peaks, respectively,
which were the highest registered. For this reason, 5 M KOH was chosen
as the electrolyte for galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) tests.
Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M KOH device scan rate study (SRS) and CV are presented
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (a) Cyclic
voltammogram (CV) as a function of scan rate (SRS) for
the 10th cycle. (b) CV for different cycle numbers of Ag/paper/Zn-Ag
soaked in 5 M KOH. SRS and CV were performed at room temperature,
step size of 5 mV, and 20–120 and 80mV/s scan rates, respectively.

SRS in Figure 2a,
accompanied by Figure S2, demonstrated
that peak potentials for both anodic and cathodic, are not independent
of the scan rate, that is, electrode’s potential at which oxidation
and reduction occur is not constant at all scan rates. Moreover, the
Randles–Sevčik plot in Figure S2 revealed that, for
each scan rate, Ipeak (anodic) ≠ Ipeak (cathodic). Both previous occurrences indicate
the presence of quasi-reversible behavior.23−26 Faradaic mechanisms are confirmed
by the presence of two anodic peaks and one cathodic peak. These two
anodic peaks appear at +2 V (60.71 mA/cm2) and +2.3 V (52.81
mA/cm2), and the cathodic peak appears at +1.2 V (−79.7
mA/cm2). Secondary zinc/silver oxide batteries had been
described in the literature, and their electrochemical cell reactions
(in aqueous KOH) are usually as described in eq 1 1  

The discharge of this type of batteries happens in the forward
reaction, while the charge process is given by the backward reaction.
There are two known reactions happening at the silver electrode during
the charge process 2   3  

The anodic peaks detected in CV measurements for the Ag/Paper/Zn-Ag
device of this work can be attributed to the oxidations, that is,
the loss of electrons, described in eqs 2 and 3. Equation 3 describes the first anodic peak, and eq 3 describes the anodic peak
at higher potential.27 At the same time,
zinc electrode is reduced following eq 4 4  Since these three mechanisms
are reversible, discharge process will follow the reverse direction
of reactions. In Figure 2b, it can be observed the reactions are stable for a scan rate of
80 mV/s. Little differences between curves from 3rd to 20th scans
can be also appreciated.

XPS measurements were performed on
Ag and Zn-Ag electrode surface
as printed and after electrochemical studies with 1 M NaCl solution.
In the latter, apart from the top surface analysis, the electrodes
were also peeled with scotch tape to analyze the inner interface.
The obtained general XPS spectra are displayed in Figure 3. The complete XPS spectra
peaks can be consulted in Table S2 (Supporting
Information). Figure 3a (Ag electrode) shows that before the electrochemistry studies,
only C 1s, Ag 3d, O 1s, and Ag 3p orbitals were detected. On the contrary,
after the electrochemistry, Na 2s, Zn 3p, Zn 3s, Cl 2p, Zn 2p, and
Na 1s appeared in both top surface and the surface of peeled samples,
which was expected due to the possible presence of Zn species moving
through the liquid electrolyte that also soaked the electrodes. The
spectra in Figure 3b reveal the presence of Ag 3d, Ag 3p, O 1s, and C 1s on the electrode’s
surface before electrochemistry as XPS is only a superficial technique;
peaks related to Zn are not expected. After the electrochemical studies,
Zn 3d, 3p, 3s, and 2p peaks appear on the electrode’s top surface
while Ag 3p peaks disappear and Ag 3d suffers a great loss in terms
of intensity. This can be explained by the material loss in the Ag
layer due to electrochemical irreversibility, decreasing its thickness
or by the deposition of Zn compounds, which moves through the electrolyte
on the Ag layer. The migration of material in zinc electrodes followed
by shape change has been reported previously.27 Moreover, Cl 2p and Ni LMM peaks appeared after the electrochemistry.
The first is related to the electrolyte, while the latter can be associated
with the LAIRD tape used as the device’s external output since
it is a Ni–Cu conductive alloy. When analyzing the electrode’s
inner surface attached to the scotch tape, F 1s and F KLL peaks appeared,
and there is no sign of Ag. Fluorine is part of Zn paste’s
composition.

(b) Zn-Ag electrode.

Cross-sectional areas
of Ag/paper/Zn-Ag samples as printed and
after the electrochemical studies with 5 M KOH were observed by SEM,
and the images are displayed in Figure 4. In the image of the as-printed sample, the Ag layer
is well identified as the brighter gray color present on top and bottom
of the image, and Zn shows a darker gray color and it is formed by
flake-like sheets. The black color of the paper sheet can be also
observed. After the electrochemical studies (Figure 4, after electrochemistry), the Zn layer lost
its flake-like structures, turning into smaller rounded flakes while
the silver layer is reduced. However, the CV measurements reveal that
devices are working even though these morphology changes occur. Figure S3 better illustrates the Ag and Zn-Ag
electrodes top view SEM images as printed and after 20 cycles at 80
mV/s CV measurements. The EDS obtained in each region are shown in Table S4 of the Supporting Information. The obtained
values agree with XPS results.

cell as printed (left)
and after electrochemical studies with 5 M KOH (right).

EIS measurements were performed on Ag/paper/Zn-Ag with the
5 M
KOH device. The obtained Nyquist plot shape in Figure 5 is similar to the ones obtained for Li-ion
batteries.28−30 As in Li-ion batteries, in the Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M
KOH device, the EIS response shows a straight line with a positive
slope and a small curvature that intersects the abscissa axis in the
high-frequency region, revealing the battery’s stray inductance
due to the screen-printing architecture and ohmic losses. The charge
transfer reactions at electrode surfaces are reflected in real impedance
as anode and cathode activation losses by the presence of the depressed
semicircles in the middle frequency region, with some inductive effect.
This device has no mass transport losses. The complete equivalent
electrical circuit can be observed in Figure 5, and the fitting parameters are displayed
in the table therein.

Figure 5 Nyquist plot obtained for the Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M KOH device
performed
between 1 MHz and 0.1 Hz at room temperature. The dashed line corresponds
to the fitting to an inductor (L1) connected in series with a resistor
(R1) and with two parallel connected cathode and anode elements (R2
– C2 – L2 and R3 – C3 – L3) and another
resistor (R4). Equivalent electrical circuit fitted from both Nyquist
and Bode plots as displayed in the circuit above.

Ag/paper/Zn-Ag cells soaked with 5 M KOH and encapsulated were
submitted to GCD tests. Right after the encapsulation, OCP was measured.
Then, a first discharge, limited to 0.3 V minimum voltage, was imposed
by applying −50 μA and −1 mA. Discharge plots
are presented in Figure 6a. For 50 μA constant current applied, the discharge took more
than 8 h, while for −1 mA, the discharge was completed in 9
min. Cyclic GCD was performed, and +1.0 and −1.0 mA were, respectively,
applied for charging and discharging the device after a previous complete
discharge. On 1st
and 2nd cycles, charging was set to last for 15 min, while discharging
was only considered to be completed when the voltage dropped to 0.3
V. Charges 3rd, 4th, and 5th were applied for 20 min. The GCD plot
in Figure 6b reveals
that 1.73 and 1.81 V were achieved for 15 and 20 min of charging,
respectively. Also, the charging profile changes between 1.60 and
1.68 V, and this fact corresponded to a color change on the silver
electrode, confirming the oxidation reaction mentioned previously
and presented in CV. This voltage value matches the beginning of the
first oxidation peak on the CV plot in Figure 2b, that is, Ag oxidation
to Ag2O. Discharge plateaus were expected since two voltage
plateaus are described in the literature for zinc/silver oxide batteries,
which are related to the two-step reduction of AgO to Ag. However,
only one plateau is observed, which, in fact, is in accordance with
the charge process performed. This voltage plateau, above 1.5 V on
every cycle, is therefore attributed to the monovalent oxide reduction.
First and second discharges lasted 14 min (average) for 15 min of
charging, while third, fourth, and fifth lasted 18 min (average) for
20 min of charging. Other GCD tests were performed to confirm that
the referred reaction was a key step to convert and store electrical
energy in the device so that the discharge was faster when the reaction
did not happen. After the end of the last discharge, OCP was measured,
showing self-recuperation in terms of voltage.

of GCD tests on Ag/paper/Zn-Ag cells with
5 M KOH. Constant current discharges with −50 μA and
−1 mA applied. (b) Cyclic GCD on the Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M KOH
device. First and second charging stages lasted 15 min, while the
rest took 20 min. Currents +1 mA and −1 mA were applied for
charging and discharging the device, respectively, at room temperature.

To have a first impression on the cycling stability
of the battery,
the areal capacity on charge and discharge steps was plotted against
the cycling number (Figure 7). The difference between charge and discharge was equal to
or lower than 0.002 mA/cm2 for each cycle. The Coulombic
efficiency (CE) is also plotted in Figure 7 and was defined by eq 5 5  where Cd is the discharge areal capacity of the cell on a single
cycle
and Cc represents the charge areal capacity
for the same cycle.31 An average of 90.6%
CE for five cycles was determined. On an ideal scenario, this value
would be 100%; since this is not the case, the device might be facing
undesired irreversible side reactions during its performance.

efficiency versus cycle number.

To demonstrate the viability of the Ag/paper/Zn-Ag
5 M KOH device
as a viable energy storage device, it was tested to power a commercial
red LED (20 mW, 660 nm). A single cell and a set of three series of
parallel-connected five cells were tested. The devices were totally
discharged at first, recharged, and then connected to the LED. Images
of a single cell and series/parallel connection are shown in Figure 8. The single cell
was connected to an LED after charging (+1 mA for 20 min), and one
frame from the video recorded when the device was connected to the
LED is shown in Figure 8. A single cell was capable of powering a red LED, even though the
LED brightness was low, for 4–6 h. When the LED got to its
off state, the device was recharged, again with +1 mA, but this time,
it lasted for 30 min. The charging process ended, and the device was,
again, connected to the LED and able to power it once again with similar
brightness, this time only for 20–40 min.

Figure 8 Single cell and series/parallel
cell connection devices. Red commercial
LED powered by each of Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M KOH device.

The same procedure was applied to the set of devices connected
as mentioned before. The charge process was performed by applying
+5 mA during 20 min followed by its connection to continuously power
the LED; this time, the light emission was observed only for 2–3
min (approximately), but the emitted light was much brighter, as shown
in Figure 8. However,
the LED emission was a blinking light, which might be caused by current
leaks between cells due to bad contact connections of LAIRD tape.

Conclusions
Ag/paper/Zn-Ag (2 × 2 cm2) cells were screen-printed,
and among other concentrations tested, the 5 M KOH electrolyte solution
led to a higher current density with an average OCP of 1.11 V and
quasi-reversible behavior with anodic peaks at +1.96 V (60.71 mA/cm2) and +2.30 V (52.81 mA/cm2) and a cathodic peak
at +1.21 V (−79.7 mA/cm2). CV and GCD studies demonstrated
the electrochemical performance of the developed device, which is
comparable to that of zinc/silver oxide secondary batteries. SEM-EDS
and XPS measurements obtained after electrochemistry studies revealed
that Zn is deposited on the electrode surface. The oxidation of Zn
was observed through SEM-EDS analysis where the typical nanoflower
and nanoneedle structures of ZnO are observed. This was also confirmed
by the increase in the atomic percentage of oxygen at the electrode
surface. SEM cross-sectional images confirmed that after electrochemical
processes, the initial flake-like shape of Zn is no longer observed
and the Ag electrode layer was consumed after faradaic mechanisms
happened. EIS Nyquist plot revealed a conventional Li-ion batteries
behavior, and GCD showed Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M KOH device as a secondary
battery. A 90.6% CE was measured for a single cell. A potential increase
measured without any current applied revealed a self-charge device.

A red LED was powered by a single Ag/paper/Zn-Ag 5 M KOH cell for
4–6 h after 20 min of +1 mA application. Five cells connected
in parallel were prepared, and then three of these sets were connected
in series to supply power in the same red LED. Although high brightness
is observed, the duration was much less (2–3 min). This was
attributed to ohmic losses in the electrical parallel and series connections,
which will be improved in further works.

Experimental Section
The studied structure consists of a stack architecture where a
commercial paper sheet is both the substrate and the separator of
the device. The electrodes were printed on opposite sides of the substrate
in a 2 × 2 cm2 (electrodes overlapping area) squared
geometry (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Schematic
of the geometry for the paper battery.

The electrodes were printed on office paper with a medium-sized
pneumatic flat screen printer from ATMA (model AT-60FA). Zinc inks
were applied on the surface of the paper by bar coating (performed
with K Control Coater from RK Print Coat Instruments; bar, 3; velocity,
3), previously to the screen-printing stage. Commercial silver and
carbon inks were screen-printed according to steps 1 to 3 of Figure 10. All heat treatments
were performed on a UN160 lab oven from Memmert.

(7) Encapsulated device.

Devices were encapsulated
following the procedure in Figure 10, from step 4 to
7. External contacts were prepared with two different conductive adhesive
tapes of Cu and LAIRD. These were laser cut in a 0.5 × 2.9 cm2 rectangular geometry. Two different types of encapsulation
were tested with polyethylene sealing films (Titer-Tops) and Fellowes
80 μm laminating pouch, and both were previously cut in 6 ×
6 cm2 squares. To protect the device from any kind of glue
and residues, two 3 × 3 cm2 polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) squares were placed between the paper device and the outer encapsulation
film, one for each side. The lamination was performed, immediately
after soaking the device in the electrolyte solution, on a Fellowes
Venus A3 laminating machine using room temperature and the 80 μm
temperature settings already installed in the equipment for the polyethylene
sealing films and Fellowes laminating pouches, respectively.

OCP, CV, and SRS were performed on AUTOLAB PGSTAT204, and EIS measurements
were performed on Gamry Instruments Reference 3000 Potentiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA.
All electrochemical studies were performed with two-electrode configuration,
following the suggestions of AUTOLAB user guide.32

GCD measurements were performed with AUTOLAB PGSTAT204.
HM8118
Programmable LCR-Bridge from HAMEG was used to measure the capacitance
and resistance immediately after the device encapsulation. All measurements
were performed at room temperature.
