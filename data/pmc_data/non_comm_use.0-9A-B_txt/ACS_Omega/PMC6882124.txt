The
healing process of the fractured bone in a presence of poly(butylene
succinate-butylene dilinoleate) (PBS-DLA) copolymer containing nanosized
hydroxyapatite (HAP) particles has been investigated. The PBS-DLA
material containing PBS hard segments and DLA soft segments (50:50
wt %) was used to prepare a polymer/ceramic composite with 30 wt %
HAP. A new PBS-DLA copolymer showed a high elasticity of 500% and
15 MPa tensile strength. Addition of HAP improved tensile strength
up to 25 MPa while high elasticity has been preserved going down only
to 300% of elongation at break. A polymer nanocomposite was fabricated
into small elastic polymer rods 15 mm long and 1 × 2 mm in cross
section and used for tibia bone fixation in rats. Mallory trichrome
staining indicated that new biodegradable copolymers and its composite
containing HAP have triggered the most advanced bone healing of all
tested materials, thus indicating their high potential for bone tissue
engineering and repair.

Introduction
Biodegradable polymeric materials are
important class of materials
frequently used in biomedical technologies as resorbable sutures for
soft tissue repair.1,2 Controlled degradation time and
safe, nontoxic degradation products of biodegradable polymers, including
poly(dioxanone), poly(glycolic acid), or poly(lactic acid) (PLA),
triggered their development toward other biomedical products such
as screws, plates, or scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.3−5 Among numerous biodegradable polymers, a biodegradable poly(butylene
succinate) (PBS) is an interesting aliphatic polyester with excellent
mechanical properties and thermoplastics processability.6,7 It has promising properties for applications as bioabsorbable/biocompatible
materials for medical purposes as its properties can be easily tailored
by copolymerization with other comonomers.4,8,9 Recently, we used PBS for the synthesis
of copolyesters constituting the hard segments in multiblock copolymers,
while dimer linoleic acid (DLA) or dimer linoleic diol (DLA-OH) units
were used as the soft segment component.8,10 We demonstrate
that PBS-based copolymers undergo controlled biodegradation and show
good biocompatibility in vitro.8,11 By varying the PBS
to DLA or DLA-OH (hard to soft segment) ratio, poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene dilinoleate) (PBS-DLA) or poly(butylene succinate-dilinoleic
succinate) copolymers, covering a wide range of mechanical properties
and degradation rates, can be synthesized.10,12

Ceramic materials are commonly used in bone implantation.13,14 Particular interest is focused on bioactive ceramics, including
sintered hydroxyapatite (HAP) which bonds to the living bone through
the bone-like apatite layer being formed on ceramic surfaces in the
biomimetic process of the living body.3 Such approach holds the promise for biodegradable and biocompatible
polymer/ceramic composite materials able to mimic the bone healing
process.15,16 Recent works on poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL)/HAP materials showed that the organic/inorganic composite is
suitable for sustainable bone implants, as it had good interaction
with the natural tissue and cells.5,17 In our earlier
study, it was demonstrated that segmented copolyester, poly(butylene
terephthalate-butylene dilinoleate) (PBT-DLA), mixed with HAP nanoparticles
and implanted subperiosteally into rabbits has triggered bone remodeling
after 180 days of observation.18

Thus, it is clearly demonstrated that organic/inorganic (polymer/ceramic)
materials are needed to mimic the natural bone structure19 and thus promote the bone healing. Therefore,
the objective of this work was to screen for the first time the bone
healing and remodeling process after implantation of new PBS-DLA/HAP
composites into tibia bone in rats. PBS-based copolyesters, where
long chain fatty acid or fatty glycol is used as soft segment components,
are relatively new and not well-explored materials, which already
demonstrated a great potential as biodegradable drug delivery vehicles9 or elastomeric scaffolds for soft tissue engineering.12 From the series of PBS-DLA copolymers where
the ratio of hard to soft segments was varied from 40:60 to 80:20,8 we selected the PBS-DLA 50:50, as this material
showed the highest elasticity at good tensile strength of all materials.
Moreover, according to our earlier work on similar copolyesters,20 where dilinoleic acid sequences were used as
the building block, we found out that adding 30% of ceramic materials
to the polyester matrix did not significantly altered mechanical properties
while triggered very good in vitro cell response. Here, the bone tissue
repair after implantation of polyester–HAP composites is discussed
based on histological analysis of tibial bones.

Results and Discussion
Material
Characterization
Biodegradable polymers and
their composites containing HAP—a calcium-phosphate ceramic
mimicking natural bone mineral components, are widely tested and already
used for bone tissue engineering.21,22 This modern
approach is much favored than using metals or allografts as they can
trigger the risk and are much expensive.23 Among many biodegradable polymers, including PCL, PLA, and their
copolymers, PBS is triggering increasing interest in biomedical applications.6 Poly(butylene succinate-butylene dilinoleate)
(PBS-DLA) copolymers8,9 are relatively new and not well-explored
materials, and the bone tissue response after implantation to such
biodegradable copolymer and its composite containing HAP (Figure 1) is reported here
for the first time.

PBS-DLA copolymers have been recently developed
and showed already
great potential for drug delivery systems and heart tissue engineering.9,24 A broad range of possible applications is arising from combined
properties of constituents used for the synthesis of these multiblock
copolymers, where glassy or semicrystalline thermoplastic components
are combined with soft elastomeric units, thus showing a biphasic
morphology of thermoplastic elastomers and properties ranging from
soft elastomers to hard solids. We already demonstrated that PBS-based
copolymers undergo controlled biodegradation and show good biocompatibility
in vitro.8,11

The chemical structure of PBS-DLA
copolymer containing 50:50 wt
% of hard to soft segments is depicted in Scheme 1.

The material characteristics
summarized in Table 1 show thermal and mechanical properties,
illustrating its thermoplastic elastomer behavior as revealed by two
distinct temperature transitions: low Tg (−45.3 °C) and high Tm (88
°C). The molecular material characteristic is similar to commercially
available PCL widely used in manufacturing various biomedical applications.5,25

Despite similar molecular mass of PBS-DLA and PCL,
the materials
show extremely different mechanical characteristics as depicted in Figure 2. The stress–strain
curve of PBS-DLA copolymer clearly shows plastic deformation below
50% strain (typical for thermoplast) and then an elastic (typical
for rubbers) region exceeding 500% strain. PCL shows similar plastic
deformation with yielding at 25% strain, and then only small elongation
leading to material fracture at 100% strain and indicating brittle
character of this material. Addition of HAP nanoparticles is leading
to increase of elastic modulus for the PBS-DLA material (from E = 98 ± 4 to E = 178 ± 7 MPa)
while preserving still good elasticity (strain at break reduced from
500% to only 280%). In contrary, addition of HAP nanoparticles to
the PCL material resulted in increase of elastic modulus (from E = 380 ± 28 to E = 890 ± 90
MPa) but elongation at break decreased to 70%. An increase of modulus
of elasticity for both polymer matrices after introducing HAP nanoparticles
is because of the nanoreinforcement.25

Histology of Bone Tissue after Fixation with
New Materials
Biodegradable polyesters are important group
of materials used
in tissue engineering as already indicated by numerous studies, including
bone tissue engineering.5 The process of
tissue regeneration especially after bone fracture is complex and
depends mainly on vascularization and stable fixation.26 Therefore, the PBS-DLA copolymer and its composite
containing 30 wt % HAP have been used in this study for fracture fixation
for the first time, and the healing process of the bone after the
fracture, stabilized with implanted biomaterials (Figure 3), has been analyzed from histological
examinations of the explanted tissue.

The histology of bone tissue reconstructed with the PBS-DLA copolymer
is shown in Figure 4A–D. For the PBS-DLA copolymer, we found that in the endochondral
ossification process,19 the woven bone
(primary or temporary) callus was formed with osteocartilaginous trabeculae
formation. As can be seen from Figure 4, the fibrocartilaginous callus (violet arrows), with
the areas of woven bone (Figure 4A, red arrows), is visible. The cartilaginous region
(Figure 4—blue
arrows) was observed in the fracture zone, particularly at the periphery
of bony callus. In process of endochondral ossification,19 the woven bone (primary or temporary) callus
was formed (Figure 4A–D; red arrows) with osteocartilaginous trabeculae (Figure 4C,D; orange arrows).
This tissue response is clearly indicating normal healing process.

The inorganic HAP, which
is an important component of natural bone
tissue,27 has triggered much stronger stimulation
of bone regeneration compared to the neat copolymer after 8 weeks
of implantation. The results observed for the PBS-DLA/HAP nanocomposite
used in this work are comparable in term of bone regeneration to PCL/HAP22 or poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid)/HAP28 nanocomposites and showed much
faster healing compared to the neat polymers. As can be seen from Figure 5, for the PBS-DLA/HAP
composite material containing 30 wt % of HAP nanoparticles, the cartilaginous
phase was also present, however the process of primary callus formation
was more advanced. Only small amount of cartilaginous material was
observed in a periosteal region (Figure 5—blue arrows; cancellous bone—red
arrows). However, larger amount was visible in deeper parts of the
callus, between the places of endochondral ossification and formation
of woven bone (Figure 5—blue arrows; woven bone—red arrows). It can be clearly
seen that incorporation of HAP into the PBS-DLA copolymer enhances
bone remodeling, thus clearly indicating that the presence of calcium
and phosphate ions from the composite material strongly stimulates
bone regeneration.

PCL/HAP composites are well-explored materials for bone implants
and bone tissue engineering17,29 and were prepared in
current study as the reference material. The examination of tissue
response to PCL/HAP composite implant revealed the cartilaginous tissue
formation typical for the fracture repair process (Figure 6). The subperiosteal region
contained a new formed cortical bone in the form of woven bone (Figure 6A,B,D; red arrows)
and also the cartilaginous callus with deeper located hypertrophic
chondrocytes (Figure 6A–D; blue arrows). Just under this, the osteocartilaginous
trabeculae (Figure 6A–D; orange arrows) lined with a layer of osteoblasts (Figure 6B,D; dark blue) were
visible and deeper a meshwork of trabeculae—bony callus (Figure 6A,B,D; red arrows).
The tissue response to the PCL/HAP composite material is comparable
to our new PBS-DLA/HAP composite material, however the bone tissue
remodeling was somehow slower.

The experimental data obtained for the bone fracture healing
process
with the use of polymeric and composite (containing HAP nanoparticles)
implants were compared to the results of fracture healing without
the polymer/composite, only with the use of Kirschner wire stabilization
(Figure 7). As can
be seen from Figure 7, in the subperiosteal bone surface, two stages are clearly seen:
the cartilage callus with the proliferating phase (Figure 7C; blue asterisk) and hypertrophic
chondrocytes (Figure 7A,B,D; blue arrows) and the endochondral ossification in that the
cartilage (Figure 7A–D; blue arrows) surrounded by the woven bone (Figure 7A–D; red arrows). Between
them, the osteoblast/chondrocyte junction was visible (Figure 7A,C,D; dark blue arrows). The
endosteal surface was formed by the compact bone, with the not fully
organized bone lamellae (Figure 7A–D; red arrows). The results obtained with
Kirschner wire were comparable to bone stabilization with the PCL
material (data not shown here). The advantage of using the biodegradable
polymer/HAP nanocomposite over the conventional approach used in clinics,
which is bone stabilization with Kirschner wire, is clearly demonstrated
when the results of in vivo bone healing were compared. Histological
observations clearly indicated that the effect of such stabilization
is comparable to the bare PCL polymer, and less pronounced bone healing
was observed as compared to polymer/ceramic nanocomposites.

the fracture without polymer/composite implants with
Kirschner wire stabilization only. The cartilaginous callus ((A,B);
blue arrows) and areas with woven bone ((C,D); red arrows). In the
middle part, the endochondral ossification with woven bone ((C,D);

dark blue arrows). Staining: H–E: A,B; Mallory trichrome: C,D.
Original magnification of the objective: A,C—×5; B,D—×10.

Finally, in the experiments no polymer/composite
implant nor Kirschner
wire stabilization has been used (Figure 8), at the subperiosteal surface, the cartilage
(cartilaginouscallus) tissue was present (Figure 8A–D; blue arrows). Around the tissue,
where hypertrophic chondrocytes were located, the osteocartilaginous
trabeculae (Figure 8A–D; orange arrows) and woven bone (Figure 8A–D; red arrows) were observed. In
the endosteal surface, the new but not fully organized cortical bone
was visible (Figure 8A–D; yellow asterisk), and this clearly indicate that mechanical
fixation (either with polymer/ceramic implant or Kirschner wire) is
important for the healing process of natural bone.30 It can also be noticed that at the central part (between periosteum and bone
near to the endosteum), the granulation tissue (procallus) could be
recognized (Figure 8A,B), that included blood vessels (Figure 8B; white asterisks), fibrocartilaginous callus
(Figure 8C; violet
arrow), and woven bone (Figure 8A–D; red arrows).

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated a polymer/ceramic
slurry preparation
and solvent evaporation process for obtaining the PBS-DLA/HAP composite.
We showed that 30 wt % of HAP nanoparticles were successfully incorporated
into the PBS-DLA matrix forming materials of well-preserved elastomeric
properties (elongation at break of 280%), high strength at break of
25 MPa, and an elastic modulus of ∼170 MPa, thus providing
physically stable, strong, and elastic materials for bone fixation.
New PBS-DLA/HAP nanocomposite materials triggered the most advanced
bone remodeling of all tested materials indicating that the presence
of calcium and phosphate ions from the composite material strongly
stimulates bone regeneration. Collectively, our results demonstrate
high potential of the developed composite material for bone tissue
engineering and repair.

Experimental Section
Materials Preparation
The neat PBS-DLA copolymer containing
50:50 wt % of hard/soft segments, synthesized as described in,10 and PCL (Capa 6430, Mn = 43 000 g/mol, Perstop) as a reference material were used.
Polymer/ceramic composites containing 30 wt % of HAP (purity ≥
90% as Ca3(PO4)2, KT, Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany, Figure 1a,b)
were prepared for implantation study. Polymers were dissolved first
in dichloromethane (POCh, Poland) to prepare 10 w/v solutions, and
then HAP was added and dispersion was sonicated at 0.5 cycle and 50%
amplitude for 30 min. Polymer/ceramic composite slurry was placed
in a Petri dish, and the solvent was slowly evaporated for 24 h. Samples
(0.5 mm thick, 4 mm wide and 20 mm long) (Figure 1c) were EtO sterilized and used for implantation.

Materials Characterization
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was performed using the Q100, TA Instruments apparatus to determine
thermal properties. The samples were dried in vacuum at 70 °C
for 24 h. The DSC process was carried out in a triple cycle, “heating–cooling–heating,”
in the temperature range of −100 to 300 °C. The heating–cooling
rate was 10 °C/min. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined from the second run in order
to eliminate the thermal history from the sample as the temperature
corresponding to the upper inflection point or maximum of the curve.
The melting point (Tm) and crystallization
temperature (Tc) were determined as the
values corresponding to the maximum of endothermic curve and the minimum
of exothermic curve, respectively. The quasistatic tensile data were
collected at room temperature with an Instron 3366 tensile tester
equipped with a 500 N load cell, employing a crosshead speed of 100
mm/min. The strain was measured using the clamp displacement, according
to DIN 53 455. The starting clamp distance was 25 mm. The obtained
results were averaged from six specimens with a cross-section of 0.5 ×
4 mm.

Bone Fixation with Polymer Composite Materials
The
study was performed on 28 male Wistar rats weighing 300–350
g. Anaesthesia was performed by intramuscular injection of ketamine
at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight. The animals were divided into
four groups of seven animals each. After anaesthesia, right tibial
bones were unveiled, cut through, and joined together (Figure 3). Right tibial bones were
joined with the PBS-DLA, PCL polymers, and their composites containing
30 wt % of HAP. Each material was anchored in seven right tibias in
seven rats. Additionally, left tibial bones in eight animals (2 from
each group) were used to study the healing process after bonding with
Kirschner’s steel wire, which is routinely used for bone anastomosis.
Another eight left tibia bones of animals (2 from each group) were
cut and left without anastomosis to check the natural bone healing
process. The remaining left tibia bones were not surgically exposed,
and the wound was closed. The technique of bone anastomosis was based
on the use of material rods 15 mm long and 1 × 2 mm in cross-section.
The material specimens were placed along the cut bone and attached
to each splinter with one loop of unabsorbed Prolen 4.0 seam. Kirschner’s
wire used for anastomosis had a diameter of 1 mm and was cut into
15 mm lengths. The wound was closed with skin sutures 5.0. Animals
were observed for 8 weeks. During this period, they received standard
food and water without restrictions. During the 8 weeks of experiment,
the animals showed normal activity. Samples of polymers were retrieved
after 8 weeks after euthanasia by intramuscular injection of sodium
pentobarbitone at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight, and tibial bones
were collected for examination. Animal studies were performed at the
Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin (P. Prowans, MD, N. Czapla,
MD) based on the permission from the Local Ethical Commission 9/2014
from 06.06.2014. Ethical principles and guidelines for scientific
experiments on animals were respected throughout this study. The maintenance
and handling of the experimental animals followed EU Council Directive
86/609 EEC, and the animals were treated in accordance with the principles
of care and use of animals.

Histology Analysis
To study the
new bone formation
around the implant material, tibia of animals were cleaned of soft
tissue and were decalcified after fixation and embedded in paraffin.
Paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into series slides (3–5
μm). For the morphological analysis, slides were stained with
hematoxylin–eosin31 and Mallory
trichrome (Bio Optica Milano, Italy).
