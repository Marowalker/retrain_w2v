Concentrated sulfuric acid (SA) and
nonionic surfactant (C12H25(OCH2CH2)10OH, C12E10) form lyotropic
liquid crystalline
(LLC) mesophases in a broad range of SA concentrations; the SA/C12E10 mole ratio may vary from 2 to 11 in the LLC
mesophases in the presence of a small amount of water. The mesophase
is hexagonal at low SA concentration and cubic at higher concentrations.
Three different compositions were prepared (one hexagonal and two
cubic) with the SA/C12E10 mole ratio of 2.5,
6, and 9, denoted as 2.5LC, 6LC, and 9LC, respectively. They all display
electrochemical SA activity in Pt and Pb systems. Most interestingly,
they show the electrochemical formation of stable PbO species in a
deeply acidic medium as evidenced by the X-ray diffraction, cyclic
voltammetry, and linear sweep voltammetry experiments. The preferable
properties of PbO over PbSO4 for lead acid batteries (LABs)
make it uniquely positioned as a superior gel electrolyte for the
LABs that would mitigate sulfation.

Introduction
Hygroscopic species, such as salts and
acids, can be used as solvents
in the assembly of surfactants into the lyotropic liquid crystalline
(LLC) mesophases.1−4 Acids, such as H3PO4 and H2SO4 (sulfuric acid, SA), which have very low vapor pressure,
form stable LLC mesophases in a very broad range of acid concentrations.3,4 Notice also that SA is a strong acid and forms mesophases upon addition
of a small amount of water. The mixture of concentrated SA and surfactant
is a liquid that flows when it is spread over a substrate. However,
in a short period, it absorbs enough ambient water to form a rigid
and stable LLC mesophase. The typical water uptake of a stable SA/C12E10 LLC phase changes with the SA concentration
and varies from 2.3 to 4.3 water/SA when the SA/C12E10 ratio increases from 2 to 12.4 Note also that the mesophase is two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal up
to around 3.5 SA/C12E10 and becomes micelle
cubic above this ratio. The cubic mesophases are always better conductors
than the 2D hexagonal ones due to the three-dimensional (3D) connectivity
of the ionic species in the mesophase.5 The SA/C12E10 mesophases have excellent proton
conductivities that increase with increasing SA concentration in the
media. As the SA/C12E10 ratio increases from
2 to 11, the proton conductivity increases from 2 to 19 mS/cm.4

Acid–surfactant and salt–surfactant
mesophases have
great potential to be used as gel electrolytes in various electrochemical
devices such as batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors, electrochromic
devices, and so on.6−11 The LLC mesophases have already displayed excellent conductivity
that finds application in many electrochemical systems.2,3,6−11 In this report, this phase and its application in lead acid batteries
(LABs) will be investigated.

Recent industry projections predict
that LABs will hold their dominant
position in the energy storage market in the near future, owing to
their current standing applications such as starter batteries in cars
and uninterrupted power supplies at various institutions where low
cost, reliability, and relative safety of the chemistry make them
stand out.12 Applications where safety
is the most critical component, as is the case in military applications,
LABs’ proven safety record makes them indispensable. For example,
LABs are used to buffer the output of the reactor in nuclear submarines.
The U.S. Department of Defense has recently awarded a contract worth
U.S.$31 million to improve the batteries for this application.13 On the flip side, SA industry is thriving, owing
to the established market in LABs, which use SA as an electrolyte.
The total annual consumption is estimated to be U.S.$85 billion.14 Therefore, new developments that improve LABs
would have substantial industrial and commercial impact, even though
the chemistry is mature and well-known.

In the charged state,
the positive electrode of a LAB consists
of Pb(IV) species and the negative electrode consists of Pb(0) species.
At the end of discharge, both electrodes attain Pb(II) species. The
main electrochemical reactions are as follows (forward reaction indicates
discharge)15 1   2  The formation of large PbSO4 crystals
as the discharge products, which cannot be reduced back to lead during
subsequent charge cycles, causes battery death. This process, known
as sulfation, is known as one of the leading causes of LAB failure.
To battle sulfation, LABs are designed not to stay in the discharged
state for extended periods. Although discharge products are always
PbSO4, short stays in the discharge state only allow small
and reducible/oxidizable PbSO4 crystals to form, thus preventing
compromise of the operation of the battery. Extended stays in the discharge state, however, cause formation
of large nonconducting PbSO4 particles, resulting in the
complete breakdown of the battery.16 Attempted
solutions to combat sulfation in the literature involve the addition
of conductive additives to the electrode material or involve composite
approaches, where current demands that would otherwise cause deep
discharge are drawn from an ultracapacitor instead of the LAB.17,18

At the end of the discharge cycle, if the Pb(II) species formed
were oxides and not sulfates, it would be advantageous both in terms
of the kinetics of electrode reactions and conductivity. The Pb(II)
oxide species is known to be more advantageous both in terms of conductivity
and kinetics than sulfate.15 Therefore,
during the industrial production of LABs, the active material production
starts from PbO and is mixed with enough water to produce the tribasic
PbSO4 (PbSO4·3PbO), which is more stable
in acid solutions compared with PbO. During the actual battery operation,
the Pb(II) species generated on both positive and negative electrodes
are the sulfate because that is the stable form according to the well-known
Pourbaix diagram at any pH below 8, as shown in Figure 1.15,19 In 6 M H2SO4, which is typically used in LABs, the oxide species
is not expected to be stable.

SA solution. Reprinted

LABs using gel electrolytes
are already commonplace.20,21 The gels employed are
made up of colloidal silica that is cross-linked
using the acid-based dehydration.20,21 The major
advantage of using a gel-based electrolyte is the mitigation of stratification.
The gel keeps the electrolyte homogeneous along the height of the
active material plates, which keeps the entire active material area
operational throughout the battery life. A LLC that has electrochemically
active SA would also potentially be a substituent for the colloidal
silica gel, thus eliminating the stratification in a similar fashion.

In the LLCs, we will show that the oxide species are more stable
than in the aqueous SA solution; it is verified through cyclic voltammetry
(CV), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and visibly by the color of the samples
as they come out of the electrochemical oxidation. This stability
has consequences regarding mitigation of sulfation in the LABs.

Results
and Discussion
Three different compositions were prepared
by mixing and homogenizing
quantitative amounts of C12E10, SA, and water
(1:2.5:7.5, 1:6:18, and 1:9:27 mole ratios, respectively) to obtain
the liquid crystalline gel phases. The 2.5 SA/C12E10 sample (denoted 2.5LC) displays a focal conic fan texture,
characteristic of the 2D hexagonal columnar phase (Figure 2a). The other two samples of
6 and 9 SA/C12E10 mole ratios (denoted as 6LC
and 9LC, respectively) are dark between the crossed polarizers. All
of the three samples diffract at small angles, with a slight shift
to the lower angles with increasing SA amount in the samples; see Figure 2b. Even though there
is a single line in the diffraction patterns, the mesophase is micellar
cubic in 6LC and 9LC.4 Notice also that
the surfactant molecules are not stable in concentrated SA solutions
and slowly undergo dehydration to form carbon nanoparticles. A mixture
of concentrated SA and surfactant is a transparent colorless liquid,
which slowly turns into dark brown over time. The carbonization process
is halted in the presence of a small and stoichiometric amount of
water in the LLC media. For instance, if a solution of concentrated
SA and C12E10 (undergoes slow carbonization)
is exposed to ambient laboratory condition, the mixture slowly absorbs
enough water to transform to a stable gel phase, where the C12E10 molecules are stable.

XRD patterns of 9LC, 6LC, and 2.5LC, top to bottom (b). XRD patterns
are offset for clarity.

Two separate studies have been performed to investigate the
proton
activity or the apparent pH of the LC systems. Both tests are picked
from the electrochemistry literature on well-established experiments
using SA solutions as electrolytes. The two experiments picked are
the well-known polycrystalline Pt in SA CV experiment and the standard
polarization resistance experiment on stainless steel. The CV of a
5 M aqueous SA solution, 6LC, and 9LC using Pt as the working electrode
(WE) are shown in Figure 3a (2.5LC data not shown for clarity). CVs clearly show that
both 6LC and 9LC have electrochemically active SA and display characteristic
peaks of Pt in the SA systems.22,23 This is a clear indication
that the SA inside the LLC mesophases is electrochemically active,
and that the cyclic voltammetric features of hydrogen adsorption/desorption
and the oxide formation/reduction are feasible inside the LLC mesophases.
The peak onsets shift to more positive potentials on the hydrogen
desorption/adsorption in case of LLC phases than in the 5 M SA aqueous
solution. This shift, roughly 40 mV, indicates that the activities
of H+ are slightly higher in the LLC mesophases than in
the 5 M aqueous SA solution. The corrosion rate measurements of stainless
steel in the LLC phases indicate a similar level of activity. In the
literature,24 it is well-established that
the rate of corrosion increases with increasing concentration until
6 M and decreases with further increase from 6 M SA to a concentrated
SA. As shown in Figure 3b, the corrosion rates for 6LC and 9LC not only show a rate of corrosion
that is commensurate with the above conclusion, but also that there
is a reinforcing trend of decrease in the corrosion rate with an increase
in acid amount. Based on the CV experiments of Pt and the corrosion
rates of stainless steel, the SA inside the LLC mesophases is electrochemically
active, and that the activities of the SA inside the phases correspond
to the activities of 5–10 M SA in aqueous solutions.

experiments (a) and the corrosion rate experiments
(b) to confirm the electrochemical activity and to establish an analogy
to aqueous solutions of SA.

The electrochemistry of Pb in SA is industrially important
in LABs.
Therefore, we focus on investigating the LLC mesophases using Pb as
the WE. The SA/C12E10 LLC mesophases show not
only high conductivity but also relevant electrochemical reactions.
This highlights the applicability of LLC mesophases as alternative
electrolytes in LABs. Moreover, any change in the properties of the
relevant electrode reactions may have an impact on the preparation
and preservation of the electrodes in the traditional LABs. As a result,
we mainly focus on the oxidation of Pb to PbO/PbSO4 and
subsequent reduction of the latter to Pb metal, which is the negative
electrode half-reaction in the LABs.

A typical Pb CV of a 5
M SA is shown in Figure 4. It displays an oxidation peak due to oxidation
of Pb to PbSO4 on the oxidation side and a much smaller
reduction peak attributed to the reduction of PbSO4 back
to Pb, as also shown in the literature.25−27 The weak reduction peak
is attributed to the formation of large nonconducting PbSO4 crystallites that cannot be reduced.15 The corresponding CVs in 2.5LC and 9LC mesophases display distinctively
different voltammograms. Notice that the single oxidation peak in
the 5 M SA becomes two in the SA/C12E10 samples.
We focus our attention on 9LC due to its higher SA activity (as confirmed
by the polarization resistance and the Pt electrode experiments).
Looking at the data more carefully, we notice that the oxidation peak
not only has a shoulder but also a new reduction peak, which is distinct
from the reduction of PbSO4 present. This shows the unique
effect of SA/C12E10 mesophases on the Pb redox
products. There is clearly a new species that gets reduced at a distinctly
more positive potential than sulfate. Furthermore, the ratio of PbSO4 reduction peak current to the Pb oxidation peak current is
also markedly larger in the LLC system at 1 mV/s compared with the
ratio in the 5 M SA solution, suggesting a more reversible reaction,
as shown in Table 1. The LLC system leads to smaller PbSO4 products that
are more readily reduced than their counterparts formed in the aqueous
solution.

Figure 4 CV profiles for Pb electrodes in an aqueous solution (black) compared
with those in two LLC phases (2.5LC in blue and 9LC in red).

5 M H2SO4	979.6	270.5	27.6	
Shoulder peaks can only be resolved at low sweep rates, such as
1 mV/s, indicating the slow kinetics of the process. To identify the
new species formed in the LLC system, we conducted chronoamperometry
(CA) experiments at various potentials to grow films over the Pb electrode
and characterized them using the XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 5).
First inspection of the Pb electrodes after this process shows a distinct
difference between the electrodes obtained from 5 M SA and 9LC in
terms of the color of the Pb surface. The Pb electrode is yellow-brown
in the SA/C12E10 compared with gray-white in
the 5 M SA solution (see Figure 7 for pictures). We further analyzed the electrodes
by collecting their XRD patterns. Figure 6 displays two sets of XRD patterns of the
Pb electrodes after conditioning and CA experiments. The XRD patterns
of both electrodes, after conditioning using 5 M SA and 9LC, only
displayed Pb(0) diffraction lines. However, the electrode prepared
from the CA experiment distinctively displayed lines originating from
the PbO and PbSO4 in the 9LC system (I) compared with predominantly
PbSO4 in the 5 M SA solution (II); see Figure 6b. The PbO lines are relatively
broad due to the formation of PbO nanoparticles, preferentially grown
along the [200] axis. The average particle size of the PbO particles
was determined to be 14 nm, obtained from the Scherer equation. Both
forms of PbO with similar particle sizes (α-PbO and β-PbO
with a higher concentration of β-PbO) are observed in the pattern
obtained from the 9LC electrode. The SEM images of these two electrodes,
prepared using 9LC and 5 M SA, display quite different surface morphologies.
Crystalline surface species over the surface of the electrode used
in 9LC are more uniform and much smaller than those on the electrode
used in 5 M SA, consistent with the electrochemical and XRD results;
see Figures 5 and 6. One explanation for this observed result is that
the PbO formation on the surface of the Pb electrode is stable when
it is in contact with the LLC phase opposed to the high instability
in the SA solution.

Figure 6 XRD patterns of as-conditioned Pb electrodes (a) and after oxidation
(b). The black curves (I) show the results in the LC and the red curves
(II) show the aqueous solution. XRD patterns are offset for clarity.

To test this hypothesis, the resulting
PbO/PbSO4 grown
on the Pb electrode using 9LC was submerged in the 5 M SA solution.
The loss of the initial yellow-brown color hints at the instability
of the formed oxide in the solution phase. The linear sweep voltammogram
(LSV) of PbO/PbSO4 after submerging in the 5 M SA solution
(for 24 h), showing a single reduction peak attributed to the lead
sulfate reduction back to lead, is shown in Figure 7b. Similarly, the LSV of a pristine PbO/PbSO4 shows
a shoulder peak (Figure 7a), thus suggesting the presence of another species, which is not
stable in the aqueous SA solution, in the coating. Further cycling
the potential for this lead strip did not yield the same shoulder
peak as shown in Figure 7c. These results clearly show that the oxide species, as expected,
are not stable in the solution phase, whereas they do form in LLC
mesophases and are stable.

Figure 7 PbO–PbSO4 film is developed
on top of a lead
strip in 9LC by 10 h CA, followed by LSV in aqueous H2SO4 (a). Another similar film is kept in aqueous H2SO4 for 24 h, followed by LSV (b). The CV is done after
submerging in aqueous H2SO4 for 24 h (c).

The reduction peak that is attributed
to the reduction of PbO was
also observed in the aqueous systems only when the CV was performed
to very oxidizing potentials that also lead to PbO2. This
behavior was also shown in the literature.26,27 Under these conditions, the two reduction peaks are present, and
the peak at the more positive potential is attributed to the reduction
of PbO. In the current work, the reduction peak attributed to PbO
is visible even when potentials are never swept to as positive potentials.

Conclusions
SA forms LLC mesophases with a nonionic surfactant (such as C12E10) and displays the electrochemical activity
similar to that of aqueous SA. The SA/C12E10 mesophases, however, produce stable PbO in addition to PbSO4 during the oxidation or discharge of LABs, which can be utilized
industrially. It is likely that the PbO always forms during oxidation
of lead in the discharge of LABs. However, PbO converts into insoluble,
nonconducting PbSO4 in ordinary LABs due to its high instability
in aqueous SA solution. The formation and high stability of PbO in
the case of LLC as the electrolyte would be a vital improvement for
the development of gel electrolyte LABs over traditional LABs.

One possible explanation for this effect is that the contact between
the electrode and electrolyte is hindered by the surfactant molecules.
This stabilizes the PbO formed over the electrode surface. Otherwise,
a direct contact of the SA solution with the electrode surface is
detrimental for the PbO particles and decomposes them into PbSO4. The mesophases are electrochemically active but chemically
protective for the formation and stability of PbO.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of LLC Gels
In a general procedure, the
LLC gels were prepared by varying SA/C12E10 (SA
is H2SO4 and C12E10 is
10-lauryl ether, C12H25(OCH2CH2)10OH) mole ratio from 2.5 to 9 (2.5 low, 6 intermediate,
and 9 high) and keeping the SA/H2O mole ratio constant
at 3.0. For example, the sample with a 9 SA/C12E10 mole ratio was prepared as follows: first, 9 mmol of SA (1.038 g,
85% SA) was added to 27 mmol of water (0.486 g) and stirred a few
seconds by magnetic stirrer. Afterward, 1 mmol of C12E10 (0.626 g) was added to the above clear solution. The resulting
mixture was homogenized by using a vortex mixer and then heated in
the heat bath at 80 °C for 48 h to obtain the clear gel (denoted
as 9LC). The other two compositions, 2.5LC and 6LC, were prepared
using 0.288 g SA, 0.135 g water, and 0.626 g C12E10 and 0.692 g SA, 0.314 g water, and 0.626 g C12E10, respectively, following the same procedure. For characterization,
the gels were dissolved in water and then coated on glass slides via
spin coating at 1000 rpm. For electrochemistry, the gel formed was
used directly in a vial.

Measurements
The XRD patterns were
recorded using a
Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer equipped with a high-power Cu Kα
source operating at 30 kV/15 mA and a wavelength of 1.5405 Å.
The POM images were obtained in the transmittance mode by using a
Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 polarizing optical microscope. The SEM images
were recorded using a ZEISS EVO-40 SEM operated at 15 kV.

All
of the electrochemical experiments were conducted on a Gamry Interface
5000E potentiostat. The Pt CVs were conducted in a three-electrode
cell with a 6 mm diameter Pt WE, a graphite counter electrode (CE),
and Ag/Ag2SO4 as a reference electrode (RE).

Polarization resistance experiments were conducted in a two-electrode
geometry, using stainless steel electrodes fitted through a Teflon
frit. Each stainless steel electrode had an area of 0.48 cm2. Voltage sweeps were chosen to be ±0.015 V versus open-circuit
potential (Eoc) with a sweep rate of 0.10
mV/s. A 10 min equilibration time followed by 5 h experiment was done.
The value of the self-exchange current was obtained by a linear fit
to the data near 0 V (vs Eoc).

The
Pb CVs were collected in a three-electrode cell with a Pb WE
strip of 2 cm × 6 cm, a graphite CE, and an Ag/Ag2SO4 as RE. The electrode area of the Pb WE was normalized
by an epoxy resin such that only a 6 mm diameter circular region of
Pb was exposed to the solution/liquid crystal. Moreover, the surface
of the Pb WE was conditioned before each sweep experiment at sufficiently
negative potentials to reduce all of the electrode surface. Reported
Pb in H2SO4 CVs were, in all of the cases, in
a steady state; at least 12 cycles were done and no appreciable change
was observed in subsequent cycles.

Ag/Ag2SO4 RE was fabricated following a literature
report.28 Briefly, an Ag wire 1 mm in diameter
and 3.2 mm long was oxidized under a constant current of 80 μA
for 3 h in a degassed 0.1 M Na2SO4. The formation
of gray-white Ag2SO4 as opposed to the brown
oxide was observed. Facile ion transport across the ion-exchange membrane
of RE and liquid crystal was confirmed by impedance measurements (measured Z = 346.5 Ω). The stability of the fabricated electrode
was confirmed by Pt in H2SO4 CVs over a 24 h
period. The potential calibration was done by measuring and monitoring
the open-circuit potential of a two-electrode system, in which the
working side is a Ag/AgCl RE and the reference side is the Ag/Ag2SO4 RE (Eoc = −0.407
V).

Chronoamperometry experiments were done at various potentials
for
1, 5, and 10 h for both 9LC and 5 M H2SO4 solutions
after conditioning at appropriate negative potential and linear sweep
(at 1 mV/s) to the potential of interest. A three-electrode setup
consisting of Pb WE, graphite CE, and the previously prepared Ag/Ag2SO4 RE was used. The lead strips were washed gently
with deionized water and the SEM images were taken.
