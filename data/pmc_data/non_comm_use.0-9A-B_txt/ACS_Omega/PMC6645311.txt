Fabrication
of hydrogels with unique microstructures and better
mechanical properties through the self-assembly of commercially available
synthetic polymers and small molecules is of great scientific and
practical importance. A type of physical hydrogels is prepared by
the self-assembly of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and tannic acid (TA)
in aqueous solution with a low PVA–TA concentration (0.5–6.0
wt %) at room temperature. With the increase of the PVA–TA
concentration, the water content of the hydrogels increases, and the
content of TA in the hydrogels decreases from 23.1 to 6.4%. The driving
force for the self-assembly is proven to be the hydrogen bonding between
PVA and TA, which also induces the crystallization of PVA chains.
The self-assembled PVA–TA hydrogels have diverse morphologies
that change from microspheres to oriented porous structures with the
increase of the PVA–TA concentration, and these structures
are all composed of nanosized particles, fibers, and/or sheets. Most
of the self-assembled PVA–TA hydrogels show good mechanical
properties. The highest tensile strength and elastic modulus of the
PVA–TA hydrogel prepared with 1.0 wt % PVA–TA concentration
are about 84 and 30 kPa, respectively. This self-assembly method would
lead to the fabrication of more hydrogels with unique microstructures
and properties for practical applications.

1 Introduction
As
a typical type of wet and soft materials, hydrogels are three-dimensionally
cross-linked polymeric networks that can absorb a large portion of
water while maintaining their solidlike shapes. Because of their high-water
absorption, high permeability to small molecules, similarity to biological
soft tissues, and stimuli-responsive properties in some cases, hydrogels
have been used in many fields, such as water-retention materials,
biomaterials, sensors, actuators, and so forth.1−3 Most synthetic
hydrogels are synthesized by polymerizing hydrophilic monomer(s) in
the presence a chemical cross-linking agent. Certainly, some physical
interactions such as hydrogen bonding (H bonding) and chain entanglement
also take part in the cross-linking and contribute to the mechanical
properties of the chemical hydrogels.4 On
the other hand, biological hydrogels are usually physically cross-linked
by H bonding and electrostatic interactions.5,6 More
importantly, they also have anisotropic and hierarchical structures
because of the self-assembly of biomacromolecules driven by the physical
interactions.7 There is an increasing interest
in developing biomimetic hydrogels constructed and toughened by physical
interactions.

Many kinds of self-assembled hydrogels have been
reported. The
self-assembled hydrogels are commonly made with small organic molecules
(gelators),8,9 graphene (or reduced graphene oxide) with
inorganic materials,10−12 and more often biomolecules, such as peptide,13−16 proteins,17−20 DNA21−23 and RNA,24 liposomes,25 alginates,26 and
so forth. To our knowledge, there are very few reports on hydrogels
made by the self-assembly of commercially available synthetic polymers
and small molecules.27 The driving forces
for the self-assembly include H bonding, electrostatic interaction
(ionic bonding), hydrophobic interaction, π–π interaction,
coordination, and so forth. The self-assembled hydrogels made with
biomacromolecules generally show a microstructure of interconnected
nanofibers (fibrils).28,29 Moreover, the self-assembled
biomacromolecular hydrogels usually possess poor mechanical properties.
The reported mechanical properties of the hydrogels are mostly the
shear storage moduli measured with rheological tests, which are mostly
less than 1 kPa,14,30,31 with the highest around 100 kPa,32 whereas
the tensile mechanical properties of the self-assembled hydrogels
are rarely reported. Therefore, facile fabrication of hydrogels with
unique microstructures and better mechanical properties through the
self-assembly of commercially available synthetic polymers and small
molecules is of great scientific and practical importance.

To
enable the self-assembly, polymers and small molecules that
can form strong H bonding and/or other physical interactions need
to be used. Here, we chose polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and tannic acid
(TA), which act as both H-bonding donor and acceptor, as the raw materials.
PVA hydrogel is one of the very few synthetic hydrogels that are totally
physically cross-linked. PVA hydrogels are commonly prepared with
the classic freezing–thawing method, and the physical cross-links
include crystallization of PVA and H bonding between PVA chains that
are formed during the freezing process.33,34 TA is a natural
polyphenolic compound composed of five digallic acid units attached
to a central glucose core.35 Because of
the presence of a large number of phenolic and carbonyl groups, TA
can form different types of interactions such as hydrogen bonding,
ionic bonding, and hydrophobic interactions with many small molecules
and polymers. It has been widely used in the layer-by-layer assembly
technique to prepare self-assembled thin layers with polymers such
as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone),36−38 poly(N-vinylcaprolactam),39 and polyethylene glycol.40 TA has also been applied to prepare hydrogels by H bonding
with polymers.41,42 Shin et al.43 reported a DNA/TA hydrogel in which TA plays a role as
a “molecular glue” by reversibly connecting between
phosphodiester bonds via H bonding. Fan et al.44 fabricated TA-based supramolecular hydrogels by utilizing
H bonding and ionic bonding in the presence of Fe(III) ions between
TA and several commercially available water-soluble polymers. Several
types of PVA–TA hydrogels have also been reported. For example,
Liu and co-workers45 reported a multinetwork
physical hydrogel named TA–PVA/BSA (bovine serum albumin),
in which TA cross-links with BSA proteins and PVA chains through H
bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Hong46 reported a PVA–TA hydrogel for wound dressing applications
by a freezing–thawing process. Our group47 also reported a PVA–TA hydrogel with excellent mechanical
properties and shape memory behaviors, in which the stronger H bonding
between PVA and TA and the weaker H bonding among PVA chains act as
the “permanent” and “temporary” cross-links,
respectively. These PVA–TA hydrogels are generally prepared
by the freezing–thawing method and/or the assistance of coordination
with Fe(III) ions. No PVA–TA hydrogels have been prepared with
a self-assembly method without the assistance of freezing and the
addition of metal cations.

In this work, we prepared a PVA–TA
hydrogel by the H bonding-driven
self-assembly at room temperature. The obtained PVA–TA hydrogels
exhibit diverse microstructures and good mechanical properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Hydrogel Preparation and
Characterization
The PVA–TA
hydrogels were prepared with a self-assembly method. First, PVA and
TA with a fixed mass ratio of 9:1 were dissolved in water under heating
and mechanical stirring till the formation of homogeneous aqueous
solutions. Note that at a high PVA–TA concentration, PVA and
TA coagulate to form inhomogeneous solutions; so the PVA–TA
concentration was chosen in the range of 0.5–6.0 wt % to ensure
homogeneous solutions. Then, the solutions were kept still in an incubator
at 25 °C for 5–7 days. PVA and TA did not precipitate
from the solutions immediately when the solutions were cooled to room
temperature. Instead during the standing, a layer of solidlike materials
(i.e., hydrogels) was gradually formed on the bottom of the beakers,
leaving a clear liquid in the major upper layer. The final thickness
of the hydrogel depends on the PVA–TA concentration and the
depth of the solution. As no additional chemicals or external forces
are applied to the gel formation process, the hydrogels are formed
by the self-assembly of PVA and TA molecules. The formation of self-assembled
structures and the driving forces for them will be proven in the following
parts.

Because the homogeneous aqueous PVA–TA solutions
did not completely transform into hydrogels, the water contents (WCs)
of the PVA–TA hydrogels were significantly lower than the calculated
theoretical values (94–99.5%) from the feeding ratios. The
measured WCs of the PVA–TA hydrogels prepared at different
PVA–TA concentrations are shown in Figure 1. With the increase of the PVA–TA
total concentration, the WC of the PVA–TA hydrogels increased
from 78.4 to 88.5 wt %.

Figure 1 WCs of the PVA–TA hydrogels as a function
of the PVA–TA
concentration.

The composition of the
PVA–TA hydrogels may also be different
from the feeding mass ratio (9:1). To obtain the actual compositions
of the PVA–TA hydrogels, elemental analyses were carried out.
PVA and TA have significantly different contents of the hydrogen element,
and they are 9.15 and 3.08%, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a, with the increase of the
PVA–TA concentration, the hydrogen element contents of the
PVA–TA hydrogels increase from 7.75 to 8.76%. By simple arithmetic
calculations, the real solid contents of PVA and TA in the PVA–TA
hydrogels prepared at different PVA–TA concentrations are obtained.
As shown in Figure 2b, with the increase of the PVA–TA concentration, the content
of PVA gradually increases from 76.9 to 93.6%, whereas the content
of TA simultaneously decreases from 23.1 to 6.4%. These results indicate
that there is more TA in the hydrogels prepared at a low total PVA
and TA concentration (<4.0 wt %) than the feeding ratio (10 wt
%) while less at a higher PVA and TA concentration. The possible reason
is the competition between H bonding among PVA chains and that between
PVA and TA. At a higher PVA–TA concentration, the close contact
of PVA chains leads to the easier formation of H bonding among them
and hence possibly the formation of more PVA crystallites (this will
be proven in the following part), which prevents the formation of
H bonding between PVA and TA.

Figure 2 Change of the hydrogen element contents (a)
and PVA and TA solid
contents (b) in the PVA–TA hydrogels with the PVA–TA
concentration.

Our previous work has
proven that strong H bonding is present in
the tough, shape memory PVA–TA hydrogels.47 The PVA–TA hydrogels in this work are prepared with
a different method and at much lower concentrations of PVA and TA.
Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR)
characterizations of pure PVA and TA and dried PVA–TA hydrogels
were performed to prove the presence of H bonding between PVA and
TA. As shown in Figure 3, the broad and strong absorption bands at 3276 and 3268 cm–1 in the spectra of PVA and TA are attributed to the symmetrical stretching
vibration of hydroxyl (−OH) groups, respectively. However,
the −OH stretching peaks of the PVA–TA hydrogels at
the PVA–TA concentrations of 0.5 and 3.0 wt % are shifted to
a lower wavenumber of 3259 and 3263 cm–1, respectively.
It is well-known that the formation of intra- or intermolecular H
bonding reduces the force constants of the chemical bonds, leading
to a shift to lower wavenumbers of their vibrational frequencies.48 We can speculate that the H bonding exists between
PVA and TA.

Figure 3 ATR–FTIR spectra of pure PVA and TA and dried PVA–TA
hydrogels obtained at a PVA–TA concentration of 0.5 and 3.0
wt %.

As is well-known, PVA is a semicrystalline
polymer, and crystallites
are present in PVA solids and the hydrogels prepared solely or mainly
with PVA. As shown in Figure 4, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the PVA solid shows
three typical peaks at 2θ = 19.6°, 22.9°,
and 40.8°, corresponding to the (101), (200), and (102) planes
of PVA crystallites.49 The XRD pattern
of TA shows a blunt peak centered at 2θ = 26.1°
rather than the obvious sharp peaks of crystalline structures, which
indicates the amorphous nature of TA. The PVA–TA hydrogels
show similar XRD patterns as PVA, suggesting the presence of PVA crystallites.
For the PVA–TA hydrogels prepared with a PVA–TA concentration
of 0.5, 3.0, and 6.0 wt %, their crystallinities are 25.58, 26.39,
and 30.98%, respectively, lower than the crystallinity of PVA (38.05%).
The results reveal that the addition of amorphous TA leads to the
decreased crystallinities of the hydrogels. The increased crystallinity
of the PVA–TA hydrogels with increasing concentration of PVA
and TA is consistent with the increase of PVA content in the hydrogels
(Figure 2b).

Figure 4 XRD patterns
of PVA, TA, and PVA–TA hydrogels obtained at
25 °C at a PVA–TA concentration of 0.5, 3.0, and 6.0 wt
%.

It is necessary to note that no
PVA crystallites are present in
the PVA–TA hydrogels reported in our previous work47 because of the fast formation of H-bonded PVA–TA
aggregates at a high PVA–TA concentration (>10 wt %) even
during the mixing at a high temperature, whereas at a low PVA–TA
concentration, no obvious large aggregates are formed when PVA and
TA are mixed at a high temperature. Only when the solutions are cooled
to room temperature and stood for a long time (days), a layer of solidlike
material containing PVA crystallites is gradually formed. It is also
necessary to mention that blank PVA solutions without TA cannot crystallize
and hence transform into hydrogels after a long standing time (months)
at room temperature, even at a high PVA concentration. Therefore,
it is reasonable to conclude that TA facilitates the crystallization
of PVA chains, and the possible reason is that the formation of H
bonding between PVA and TA leads to the approaching and aggregation
of PVA chains, which enables the proper conformations required for
their crystallization. On the other hand, the formation of H bonding
between PVA and TA decreases the ratio of PVA that can crystallize
and hence the lowered crystallinity of the gels prepared at a low
PVA–TA concentration.

In summary, the driving force for
the self-assembly is essentially
the H bonding between PVA and TA, and it also induces the crystallization
of PVA chains.

2.2 Morphologies of Hydrogels
Figures 5 and S1 show that
the hydrogel prepared at a PVA–TA concentration of 0.5 wt %
is completely composed of microspheres. The size distribution of the
microspheres is shown in the inset of Figure 5b. The diameter of the microspheres is in
the range of about 1–5 μm, mainly around 3 μm.
A detailed examination shows that the microspheres are linked together
by fibers (Figure 5c), and the microspheres are composed of nanoparticles with many
short nanofibers on their surfaces (Figure 5d).

Figure 5 SEM images and the particle size distribution
(inset in b) of the
PVA–TA hydrogel obtained at a PVA–TA concentration of
0.5 wt % at 25 °C. Scale bars: 100 (a), 20 (b), 5 (c), and 1
μm (d).

With the increase of
the PVA–TA concentration, the morphology
of the hydrogels changes, and significant differences are found between
the upper and lower layers of the gels. At the PVA–TA concentration
of 1.0 wt %, the hydrogel still shows the microstructure of microspheres.
On comparison to the microspheres obtained at 0.5 wt %, we find that
the microspheres become bigger, and those in the lower layer (mostly
6–8 μm, Figure 6a2) are bigger than those in the upper layer (mainly
4–5 μm, Figure 6a1) of the gel. The microspheres are also composed of nanoparticles
with many short nanofibers on their surfaces (Figure S2). When the PVA–TA concentration is increased
to 2.0 wt %, the size of the microspheres increases to be around 10
μm in the upper layer of the gel (Figure 6b1). Microspheres can also be found in the
lower layer, but the number of microspheres decreases significantly,
whereas many nanosized sheets or meshes appear (Figure 6b2). For the hydrogel prepared at a PVA–TA
concentration of 4.0 wt %, microsphere-like structures can still be
found in the upper layer, but the main morphology is oriented nanosized
sheets and meshes (Figures 6c1 and S3a). In the lower layer,
no microspheres can be found, instead, a more dense and continuous
oriented porous structure appears (Figure 6c2). Magnification of the microsphere-like
structures and the porous structure indicates that they are composed
of nanosized fibers (Figures 6c3,c4 and S3b). At the highest
concentration of PVA–TA studied, no significant difference
is found in the morphologies between the upper and lower layers of
the gel, the whole gel shows a porous structure with a pore size less
than 1 μm, and the pore walls are composed of nanosized sheets
and fibers (Figure 6d), similar to that of the PVA–glycerol supramolecular hydrogel.50

Figure 6 SEM images of the PVA–TA hydrogels obtained at
a PVA–TA
concentration of 1.0 (a), 2.0 (b), 4.0 (c), and 6.0 wt % (d) at 25
°C. (a1,b1,c1) are of the upper layer and (a2,b2,c2) are of the
lower layer of the gels; (c3,c4,d2) are the magnification of the corresponding
(c1,c2,d1), respectively.

We have also prepared PVA–TA hydrogels (0.5 wt %)
under
different conditions and examined their morphologies.

2.2.1 Cooling treatment
The homogeneous PVA–TA solution
was cooled at 0 °C (ice-water bath) for 30 min before it was left
to stand at room temperature. The morphology of the resulted PVA–TA
hydrogels is displayed in Figure 7a,b. With comparison to that without the cooling treatment
(Figure 5a,b), the
number of microspheres dramatically increases, but the size of the
microspheres significantly decreases. The diameters of the microspheres
are in the range of 0.6–2.4 μm, mainly around 1.3 μm
(inset in Figure 7a).
The cooling of the PVA–TA solution at a low temperature facilitates
the formation of H bonding among PVA chains and hence the crystallization
of PVAand the formation of more microspheres.

hydrogels (0.5 wt %) prepared under
different conditions. (a,b) Being cooled at 0 °C for 30
min before setting at room temperature, the inset in (a) shows the
particle size distribution; (c–f) with the addition of 1 ×
10–3 M SDBS; (g,h) with mechanical stirring.

2.2.2 Addition
of a surfactant
A low concentration of the
surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) (1 × 10–3 M) was added into the PVA–TA solution (0.5
wt %), and the microstructure of the resulted PVA–TA hydrogel
is displayed in Figure 7c–f. Note that there is a significant difference in the morphologies
between the lower and upper layers of the hydrogel. The lower layer
shows a loose and porous structure. Not only microspheres but also
microsized sheets with a thickness in nanometers are found in the
lower layer (Figure 7d). The upper layer is mostly composed of microspheres with a diameter
around 3–4 μm (Figure 7e). The microspheres are different from those microspheres
formed without the addition of SDBS, they show a loose porous structure
consisted of nanofibers, and the microspheres are also connected by
nanofibers (Figure 7f). Similarly, at the PVA–TA total concentration of 1.0 wt
%, more nanosheets rather than dense microspheres were observed in
the presence of SDBS (Figure S4). These
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations suggest that the
addition of the surfactant SDBS inhibits the formation of dense microstructures
by preventing the aggregation of nanoparticles.

2.2.3 Mechanical agitation
Mechanical stirring was applied
to the solution in the first 24 h during the setting at room temperature.
In this case, no microspheres appear anymore. Instead, the main microstructures
of the hydrogel are large and thick sheets or clusters as well as
very long (up to several tens micrometers) and thin (with diameters
less than 100 nm) fibers (Figure 7g,h). The mechanical agitation leads to the coagulation
of PVA and TA, so it also prevents the aggregation of nanoparticles
into microspheres.

These SEM observations show that the self-assembled
PVA–TA hydrogels have diverse morphologies that change from
microspheres to oriented porous structures with the increase of the
PVA–TA concentration, and these structures are all composed
of nanosized particles, fibers, and/or sheets. The formation mechanism
of these morphologies can be explained as follows: the formation of
H bonding between PVA and TA leads to their aggregation and crystallization
of PVA chains inside the aggregates, forming nanosized particles.
At a very low PVA–TA concentration, the aggregation and merging
of the nanoparticles in the liquid phase lead to the formation of
large microsized particles (microspheres) that can precipitate from
the solutions to form a hydrogel. When the PVA–TA concentration
is increased, the easier formation of H bonding between PVA and TA
leads to the formation of more nanoparticles that can merge into fibers
or sheets. Under the effect of gravity, the fibers or sheets precipitate
layer by layer, forming hydrogels with oriented porous structures.

2.3 Mechanical Properties of Hydrogels
Most of the self-assembled
PVA–TA hydrogels show good mechanical properties. The tensile
mechanical properties of the PVA–TA hydrogels prepared with
different PVA–TA concentrations were measured, and the typical
tensile stress–strain (σt–εt) curves are displayed
in Figure 8; the tensile
strength (σb) and elastic moduli
(E) of the PVA–TA hydrogels are summarized
in Figure 8b. Note
that the PVA–TA hydrogel prepared with 0.5 wt % PVA–TA
concentration was too weak to be tested. The other hydrogels show
high elongations (εb) in the range
of 565–950%. The PVA–TA hydrogel prepared with 1.0 wt
% PVA–TA concentration has the highest σb and E values, and they are about 84
and 30 kPa, respectively. With the increase of PVA–TA concentration,
both σb and E gradually
decrease, in accordance with the increasing WC and the decreasing
content of TA in the gels.

Figure 8 Typical tensile stress–strain curves
of the PVA–TA
hydrogels prepared with different PVA–TA concentrations (a)
and their tensile (σb) and elastic
moduli (E) (b).

Note that the mechanical properties of the self-assembled
PVA–TA
hydrogels are inferior to those of PVA–TA hydrogels prepared
by the mixing method.47 The possible reasons
are the presence of less H bonds between PVA and TA in the self-assembled
PVA–TA hydrogels (as there is a significant portion of PVA
participates in forming crystallites) and the weak interactions between
the nanosized and/or microsized structures.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
PVA
with an alcoholysis degree of 99% (Mn:
7.7 × 104) was purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China); TA (C76H52O46, A. R. grade) was purchased
from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China); and
SDBS (C18H29NaO3S, A. R. grade) was
purchased from Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory (Tianjin, China).
The chemicals were not further purified, and deionized water was used
for the hydrogel preparation.

3.2 Preparation
of Hydrogels
PVA and TA with a fixed mass
ratio of 9:1 at a total concentration from 0.5 to 6.0 wt % were dissolved
in 90 °C deionized water with the assistance of mechanical agitation
for 2 h. The resultant homogeneous solutions were transferred into
beakers preheated to 90 °C, and then the sealed beakers were
placed in an incubator at 25 °C for several days. During this
period, a layer of PVA–TA hydrogel was formed at the bottom
of the beakers.

WCs of the PVA–TA hydrogels were calculated
as follows  where mwet and mdry are the weights
of the as-prepared and the dried gel samples, respectively.

3.3 Characterization
Elemental analyses of PVA–TA
hydrogels were recorded on a varioELcube element analyzer (Elementar,
Germany). ATR–FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FTIR
6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron Scientific Instruments Corp., USA).
XRD patterns of the hydrogels and raw materials were recorded with
a PANalytical-X’Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical Co. Ltd.,
Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation. The PVA–TA
hydrogel samples for SEM observations were first frozen with liquid
nitrogen for about 5 min and then freeze-dried with an LGJ-10C vacuum
freeze dryer (Beijing Sihuan Scientific Instrument Factory, China)
for about 48 h. The freshly cracked cross-sections of the freeze-dried
gel samples were observed with a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi
S-8010, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

3.4 Tensile Mechanical Tests
Tensile testing method was
the same as that used in our previous work.47 Tests were performed on standardized dumbbell-shaped gel specimens
by using an Instron 3366 electronic universal testing machine (Instron
Corporation, MA, USA) at a cross-head speed of 100 mm/min. Tensile
stress (σt) and tensile strain (εt) are defined as usual, and tensile strength
(σb) and elongation (εb) are σt and εt when the specimen breaks. The initial
elastic modulus (E) was calculated in the linear
stress and strain range between εt = 10 and 35%.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have successfully prepared PVA–TA hydrogels
through a self-assembly method performed at low PVA–TA concentrations
at room temperature. The H bonding between PVA and TA is essentially
the driving force for the self-assembly, and it also induces the crystallization
of PVA chains. The self-assembled PVA–TA hydrogels have diverse
morphologies that change from microspheres to oriented porous structures
with the increase of the PVA–TA concentration, and these microstructures
are all composed of nanosized particles, fibers, and/or sheets. The
PVA–TA hydrogels also show good mechanical properties. We believe
that the H bonding-driven self-assembly method can be expanded to
the preparation of many other physical hydrogels, and these hydrogels
with unique microstructures and properties will have many application
prospects.
