Hybrid
silica-based monoliths were synthesized at ambient pressure,
using minimum amounts of the silylating agent hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDZ). Depending on the synthesis approach, the materials ranged
from dense and vitreous xerogels to transparent and superhydrophobic
aerogels. Emphasis was given to understanding the role of the silylating
agent, its content and incorporation process on the final morphology,
and properties of the xerogels/aerogels. It is proven that as a coprecursor,
increasing HMDZ content contributes to increase the lipophilic/hydrophilic
balance, induce high surface areas, and decrease densities, but there
is a maximum usable content for producing monoliths. Conversely, as
a postsynthesis modifier, there is an optimum HMDZ content that maximizes
hydrophobicity (water contact angle of ∼144°) and induces
high surface area (∼700 m2·g–1), keeping the density low (∼300 kg·m–3). It is proven that the aging period in the hydrophobizing solution
is a crucial parameter. The most superhydrophobic xerogels were obtained
using HMDZ as a postsynthesis modifier, achieving values of water
contact angles as high as ∼173°, at the cost of density
increase to ∼600 kg·m–3 and decrease
of the surface area to ∼300 m2·g–1. The best compromise between low density, high surface area, and
superhydrophobicity is obtained using HMDZ both as a coprecursor and
as a postsynthesis modifier, in a low HMDZ/tetraethoxysilane total
molar ratio (<0.2), with an aging period of 16–24 h. The
use of subcritical drying, along with the minimization of the expensive
organic modifier quantities, allows envisaging a safe and low-cost
large-scale production of a variety of materials, including superhydrophobic
aerogels with potential distinctive applications.

1 Introduction
The
exceptional properties of silica aerogels are responsible for
the continued interest in their development, such as high specific
surface area (≥1000 m2·g–1), very low density (3–500 kg·m–3),
small pore size (1–100 nm), extremely high porosity (above
95%), very low thermal conductivity (0.01–0.02 W·m–1·K–1), and transparency to
visible light, which allow silica aerogels to be a distinguished class
of porous materials.1,2 Both transparency and low thermal
conductivity are attributed to the fine solid constituents and porous
structure in the mesopore size region.3 Given the superior assembly of properties, silica aerogels are potential
candidates for a vast range of scientific and technological applications.4−6 Despite these advantages, silica aerogels are highly susceptible
to fracture or collapse of the pore structure during the drying stage
and are difficult to prepare at large-scale settings because of their
poor mechanical properties. Several approaches to improve the mechanical
properties have been followed,7−9 yielding silica-based products
with additional capacities such as lightweight and insulating and/or
shock-absorbing materials in building and transport industries, such
as aeronautics and aerospace.10−12 Controlling the hydrophobicity
of silica aerogels will allow further applications in microelectronics
and sensing.13 In fact, superhydrophobic
aerogels are expected to efficiently contribute to solve environmental
problems, such as in oil spill cleanup operations.14−17

Conventionally, silica
aerogels were dried above the supercritical
point of the solvent, thus needing high pressures and, depending on
the solvent, high temperatures.18,19 Though once a preferred
method, it is expensive, time-consuming, and often hazardous, rendering
the process difficult for industrial use.20 To commercially exploit aerogels or aerogel-like materials, cost-effective
drying routes are required. By using subcritical drying, their costs
are reduced and their safety is increased, partially overcoming the
drawbacks.21,22 Aerogel-like materials prepared
from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and dried at ambient pressure, with
physical properties similar to those achieved by supercritical drying,
have been reported.23

The synthesis
of hydrophobic silica aerogels has been thoroughly
reviewed.24 When drying aerogels at ambient
pressure, surface modification is the key process: by introducing
nonpolar groups (usually from silanes) at the surface of the pores,
the capillary tensions that develop upon solvent evaporation are reduced,
thus preventing pore collapse.25

We have recently reported the synthesis of superhydrophobic silica-based
aerogels prepared from TEOS, with surface modification of the wet
gel by an aging solution containing hexamethyldisilazane (HMDZ), via
ambient pressure drying.10,26

At the same time
as sylilation prevents the collapse of the silica
network during drying, it hinders reactions between adjacent silica
particles, thus rendering the network coarsening more difficult. Therefore,
it is critical to understand the impact of the silylating agent and
its incorporation process on the hybrid network.

The present
work is focused on the preparation of the lightest
and/or the most superhydrophobic hybrid silica aerogels at ambient
pressure, by modifying the silica networks with the silylating agent
HMDZ and to understand its role on the final morphology and properties
of these aerogels. Hybrid monoliths are prepared by a two-step sol–gel
process, with TEOS as a precursor, and different approaches are explored:
using HMDZ as a coprecursor (added at the condensation step), using
HMDZ as a postsynthesis modifier (in the aging solution), and using
HMDZ both as a coprecursor and as a postsynthesis modifier.

When added as a coprecursor, HMDZ hydrolyzes in aqueous solution
to trimethylsilanol (TMS) or to hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS), as described
by reactions 1 and 2,
respectively 1   2  These reactions partially neutralize the medium,
thus initiating condensation and co-condensation reactions between
inorganic and/or organically modified species at different stages
of hydrolysis and condensation, such as 3a  (slow
in acidic medium,27 it yields the first
inorganic dimer that can further condense) 3b   3c  and so on, toward the organically modified
silica (ORMOSIL) network.

Other condensation reactions may occur
between partially hydrolyzed
HMDZ, with the formation of HMDS28 3d  (slow when the concentration of the TMS species
is low). If any NH3 is still present, the reverse reactions
of 1 and 2 can regenerate
HMDZ.

Reactions 2 and 3d,
on the other hand, consume HMDZ and TMS, respectively, which no longer
contribute to the formation of the ORMOSIL network.

As a postsynthesis
modifier, HMDZ reacts with the silanol groups
at the surface of the pores, by the proposed overall reaction29 4  

It was proven that this is a two-step
process:30 (1) HMDZ reacts with a surface
silanol to form a surface-bound
trimethylsilyl and a reactive intermediate trimethylaminosilane and
(2) trimethylaminosilane reacts with another surface silanol, forming
a trimethylsilyl surface species and ammonia. The reaction is initially
fast as nonhydrogen-bonded silanol groups, either isolated or geminal
[=Si(OH)2], are consumed. At longer times, it becomes
slower because of hindered adsorption of HMDZ onto geminal silanols
that already have one silylated hydroxyl group. Hydrogen-bonded surface
vicinal silanols [≡Si–OH···HO–Si≡]
are much less available.

Once the different roles of HMDZ are
understood, it is possible
to envisage a synthesis procedure that maximizes superhydrophobicity
or surface area or minimizes the density of the final hybrid aerogel,
trying to use as minimum amounts of HMDZ as possible.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Hybrid Aerogel
Monoliths
The hybrid silica aerogels were synthesized as
monoliths, following
the procedures schematized in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Scheme of the preparation of the hybrid silica aerogels.

In series A, HMDZ was used as
a coprecursor. In series
B, HMDZ was used only as a postsynthesis organic modifier, and in
series (A + B), HMDZ was used both as a coprecursor and as a postsynthesis
modifier.

The series of aerogels were synthesized by a two-step
sol–gel
process consisting of (1) acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of TEOS and (2)
base-catalyzed polycondensation of the resulting silanol groups. In
step (1), TEOS was previously diluted in 2-propanol and distilled
water was added, dropwise, while stirring. The reaction mixture was
acidified with 1 M HCl to initiate the hydrolysis process at pH 2.0.
The acidic colloidal solution was placed in a sealed container, heated
at 60 °C, with orbital stirring at 120 rpm for 60 min. In step
(2), condensation was induced by adding a HMDZ solution in 2-PrOH,
dropwise, with stirring at 140 rpm (series A) or by adding a NH4OH 0.1 M aqueous solution (series B), at pH 7.0. The resulting
homogeneous sols were left to gel, with no further stirring, and then
allowed to age in the residual solution for 24 h.

Further aging
was carried out under different conditions:Samples A: for a second aging period
of 24 h in the
residual solution, followed by washing with 2-PrOH: samples Aa, where subscript a indicates
the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio in the sample or for a second aging period
of 24 h in a (TEOS + H2O + 2-PrOH) solution, in the same
proportions used in the synthesis, followed by washing with 2-PrOH:
samples Aa′.

Samples
B: for a second aging period of variable duration
in a hydrophobizing solution (HMDZ + 2-PrOH), followed by washing
with 2-PrOH: samples Bb-tx, where b refers to
the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio and x to the aging period
in hours.



The properties of aerogels
were optimized by using HMDZ both as a coprecursor
and as a postsynthesis modifier, following the synthesis procedure
of series A and the aging of series B: samples Aa–Bb-tx, where a and b refer to the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio added during synthesis and aging,
respectively.

After aging, the pore liquid was exchanged with
2-PrOH, for washing,
and the gels were dried at ambient pressure at 60 °C, in a solvent-saturated
atmosphere, until their weight loss became negligible.

The photographs
of some dry hybrid aerogels are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Photographs of ambient pressure hybrid monoliths
prepared under
different conditions.

The samples Aa–Bb-t∞ and Bb-t∞ were
exceptional because hydrophobization was not stopped by washing, and
the samples were left to dry in the HMDZ solution: as the solvent
evaporates, the solubility product of NH4Cl is attained,
and a crystalline phase forms at the surface of the monoliths (Figure 3). It is mostly NH4Cl, identified in the infrared spectra by the strong triply
degenerate N–H deformation mode, at 1402 cm–1.31

2.2 HMDZ
as a Coprecursor
The effect of HMDZ acting as a coprecursor
on the structure of the dry xerogels and aerogels was analyzed for
monoliths prepared with various HMDZ/TEOS molar ratios and differing
only in the aging solution (series Aa and
Aa′), as described above.

The informative region
of the diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra is compared
in Figure 4.

Figure 4 DRIFT spectra
of hybrid monoliths using HMDZ as a coprecursor in
different contents: (A) aged for 48 h in residual solution and (B)
aged for 24 h in residual solution plus 24 h in (TEOS + 2-PrOH + H2O) mixture. Spectra normalized to the νasSi–O–Si band (at ∼1078 cm–1).

The spectra show characteristics
of hybrid silica networks, with
the silica bands at ∼1078 (νasSi–O–Si),
955 (νSi–O(H)), and 802 (νsSi–O–Si)
cm–1, and the organic moiety is identified by the
bands characteristic of the methyl groups of (Si)–(CH3)3 units: out-of-plane twisting modes (at 864/849 and
760 cm–1). These bands are better defined, and their
relative intensities increase as the HMDZ content increases. For HMDZ/TEOS
= 0.054, sample A0.054, the well-defined shoulder at 1255
cm–1 is assigned to the methyl symmetric deformation
of trimethylsilyl groups.32 The band related
to silanol groups, νSi–O(H), clearly decreases as the
content in HMDZ increases, which suggests a higher co-condensation
yield (reactions 2). Above a certain HMDZ/TEOS
molar ratio (0.107), the presence of the covalently bonded bulky (Si)–(CH3)3 groups starts hindering further condensation,
and no monoliths are obtained.

A quantitative analysis of these
spectra was carried out by deconvolution
into Gaussian and Lorentzian components in the 1300–700 cm–1 region, using a nonlinear least squares fitting method
(Figure S1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). The four Gaussian components retrieved from the bands centered
at 1095–1079 cm–1 were assigned, taking into
account the optical components of the νasSi–O–Si
mode (longitudinal and transverse, respectively, LO and TO) of the
most common primary siloxane units: sixfold (SiO)6 and
fourfold (SiO)4 rings.33 The
proportion of sixfold siloxane rings was estimated from the sum of
areas of the corresponding LO and TO components relative to the total
area of the νasSi–O–Si band. The estimated
values are summarized in Table 2 and are higher than those usually obtained for inorganic
xerogels/aerogels.34 Increasing HMDZ content
results in networks richer in the less tensioned (SiO)6 units, which tend to predominate as the population of the covalently
bonded bulky Si(CH3)3 groups increases. This
becomes clear comparing the structures obtained by energy minimization
of samples A0.011 and A0.054 (Scheme 1), which also show that the
silane groups tend to accumulate at the pores surfaces.

(BJH) algorithm.37

The lipophilic/hydrophilic balance (LHB) was estimated
from the
relative areas of all the CH3-related components (Lorentzian)
versus the silanol band in this region. The LHB values, summarized
in Table 2, increase
with the HMDZ content but are very low, indicative of hydrophilic
materials. This property was confirmed by an attempt to measure the
water contact angles: on samples with lower HMDZ/TEOS contents (Video
S1, Supporting Information), the water
droplets were instantly adsorbed, and a measure at t = 10 s was not possible.

For a certain HMDZ content, the aging
solution determines the structural
characteristics: for samples Aa′, the primary sixfold rings
are less abundant, the silanol stretching components in the DRIFT
spectra become relatively weaker, and the LHB becomes generally higher,
consistent with less hydrophilic materials;35 the values of the water contact angles obtained for samples A0.054 and A0.054′ were 21.2° and 32.5°, respectively.

Some pore morphology-related properties are also summarized in Table 2 and Figure 5 for the two series of hybrid
monoliths.

Figure 5 (A) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of aerogels
using HMDZ as a coprecursor and different aging solutions and (B)
mesopore size distribution from the BJH analysis of the adsorption
branch for samples Aa and Aa′.

The gelation times depend on the
condensation pH, and thus, they
vary strongly with the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio.27 For pH = 6 (samples A0.011 and A0.011′), the co-condensation
reactions are slowed down and the gelation time is very long (29 min).

Aging the wet gel with the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio of 0.011 for (24
+ 24) h in the residual solution yields a dense xerogel (∼1
g·cm–3), with N2 sorption isotherm
characteristic of a microporous material (type I),38 with some condensation in small mesopores (an average diameter
of ∼3 nm). As the HMDZ content increases, the xerogels become
lighter and mesoporous, characterized by type IV N2 isotherms
with type H2 hysteresis,38 with decreasing
density (increasing total pore volume) and increasing average mesopore
dimension and surface area. The increments in all the properties attenuate
as the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio increases. Unlike most hybrid aerogels,
these monoliths are transparent for the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio below
0.054 (Figure 2) because
for such low contents in the silylated groups they do not fill the
pores and there is no phase separation. A similar transparency was
reported by Kanamori for hybrid monoliths obtained from methyltrimethoxysilane,
also dried under ambient conditions.3,39

The
aging conditions are so important in determining the final
properties of the monoliths40 that just
by changing the second 24 h aging medium to a (TEOS + 2-PrOH + water)
solution, lighter (much more porous), with larger mesopores, and less
hydrophilic aerogels are obtained (series Aa′). In this case,
all samples exhibit type IV N2 isotherms with H2 hysteresis
loops (Figure 5A),
characteristic of mesoporous materials. The condensation reactions
that occur during the second aging period strengthen the silica network,
reducing shrinkage upon drying.41 By comparing
the properties of samples A0.021′ and A0.054′, it is obvious that the differences
fade out as the HMDZ content increases, suggesting that it is not
necessary to use a high content of HMDZ as a coprecursor to obtain
hybrid aerogel-like monoliths, once appropriate aging conditions are
chosen. Conversely, even these low HMDZ contents reflect in a significant
way on the structure of the hybrid monoliths.

2.3 HMDZ
as a Postsynthesis Modifier
When HMDZ acts as only a postsynthesis
modifier (samples Bb-tx),
the structure of the final aerogel depends on the HMDZ content in
the aging solution and on the aging period.

The first effect
of the increasing HMDZ content is the transition from transparent
to translucent and then to opaque monoliths (Figure 2). The DRIFT spectra of monoliths left to
dry without washing (Figure 6) allow to understand the drastic effects of the HMDZ concentration
on the structure of the dry aerogels: the bands assigned to the vibrational
modes of the nonequivalent methyl groups of trimethylsilyl units,
such as antisymmetric and symmetric stretching (at 2964 and 2900 cm–1), antisymmetric and symmetric deformation (at 1440/1417
and 1253 cm–1), out-of-plane twisting (at 863/844
and 756 cm–1), and rocking (at 690 cm–1), increase with the HMDZ content, in a clear sign of a more efficient
hydrophobization of the network. The slight shifts in comparison to
the spectra of series Aa are due to the
trimethylsilyl groups remaining exclusively at the surface of the
pores in a more nonpolar environment. For the lowest HMDZ content
(sample B0.021-t∞),
some of these bands appear to be stronger, but this is due to the
overlapping with silica bands, namely, νsSi–O–Si
(at 800 cm–1). Simultaneously, some effects are
induced on the inorganic network by hydrophobization: the νasSi–O–Si band shifts to lower wavenumbers (from
1095 to 1079 cm–1) and becomes narrower. With increasing
content in HMDZ in the aging solution, the network loses silanol groups
(more complete condensation): the relative intensities of the broad
bands at ∼3300 cm–1 (νO–H, hydrogen
bonded), 3600 cm–1 (νO–H of free groups),
and 950 cm–1 (νSi–O(H)/νSiO–) decrease.

Bb-t∞), normalized to the
νasSi–O–Si band (at ∼1090 cm–1) and (B–D) enhanced spectral regions.

The proportion of sixfold siloxane
rings and the LHB were estimated
from the quantitative analysis of the spectra in the 1300–700
cm–1 region (Figure S2 and Table S2, Supporting Information). The results are summarized
in Table 3.

The hydrophobization success is proved by the increase
in the relative
areas of the CH3-related modes with the HMDZ content, associated
with the decrease in the silanol-related components (decrease in hydrophilicity),
which become negligible for the HMDZ/TEOS ratio ≥0.214. These
evolutions bring about a drastic increase in LHB. The water contact
angles support that these hybrid monoliths range from hydrophilic
to superhydrophobic as the HMDZ content increases (Table 3 and Video S2, Supporting Information). This property assures a high stability
of these aerogels at atmospheric moisture and broadens the scope of
applications. The percentage in six-member siloxane rings increases
with hydrophobization, probably because of breaking of some siloxane
bridges in the more tensioned four-member rings as the silylation
reactions occur, with conversion to the sixfold units.

The HMDZ
concentration also influences the envelope density and
the pore structure of the hybrid aerogels, as evidenced in Table 4 and Figure 7.

Two opposite effects are induced by HMDZ: the springback that occurs
upon drying because of the presence of the methyl groups at the surface
of the pores is responsible for a decrease in density; on the other
hand, as the HMDZ content increases, more numerous bulky groups (−Si–(CH3)3) fill the pores. Thus, the density presents
a minimum at a certain value of the HMDZ concentration (sample B0.107-t∞).

These results
are confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
results (Figure 7):
the isotherms are all type IV with H2 hysteresis typical of mesoporous
materials, but the total pore volume increases with the HMDZ content
up to a maximum for sample B0.107-t∞. This particular isotherm is slightly different, as
the plateau for high pressures is not well-defined, suggesting a population
of larger mesopores, confirmed by the mesopore size distribution (Figure 7B), or even of macropores.38 In this sample, all the data point to a more
open structure because of the repulsive effect between organic groups
prevailing over the filling of the pores. The infrared spectra in
the νasCH3 region corroborate this effect:
the degenerate νasCH3 band has two components
for very low HMDZ content, at 2980 and 2964 cm–1 (observed for samples B0.021-t∞ and B0.054-t∞ in Figure 5B), the first one
initially stronger, inverting for sample B0.054-t∞. Above this content only the lower
wavenumber component appears, corresponding to the methyl groups that
fill the pores. The unrelated oscillations of the average mesopore
size in the range of 6.4–8.6 nm (estimated from the adsorption
branch, using the BJH algorithm) and of the specific surface area
in the range of ∼380 to ∼780 m2·g–1 (from the BET equation) are indicative of a change
in the pore shape as the pores become more filled with organic groups.

The optimum HMDZ content in the aging solution will depend on whether
the aim is to obtain the lightest or the most superhydrophobic hybrid
aerogel.

It is expectable that for a given HMDZ content, the
aging period
also influences the possibility of obtaining lighter hybrid aerogels.
This time effect was studied for samples with a HMDZ content that
assures a very high hydrophobicity (B0.214-tx), by varying the aging period between
4 h and t∞ (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Envelope densities (⧫) and water contact
angles (▲)
of sample B0.214-tx as a function of the aging period.

The minimum envelope density (ρe = 0.305
g·cm–3) was obtained by aging the monolith
for a period
of 16 h in a HMDZ solution corresponding to the HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio
of 0.214, but the sample is barely hydrophobic. As the aging period
is prolonged, a gain in hydrophobicity is accompanied by an increase
in density. At ∼60 h, superhydrophobicity is attained and aerogel-like
monoliths are obtained, with an envelope density of ∼0.365
g·cm–3. There is no need for longer aging periods
because stabilization is reached.

The above results prove that
for optimizing the low-density/superhydrophobicity
binomial there is no need to use a high HMDZ content or a long aging
period. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism for silylation,
according to which the reaction is expected to slow down with time
as HMDZ diffuses to geminal silanol groups already partially silylated.30 It is also convenient from the industrial viewpoint
that tends to favor short aging periods.40

2.4 HMDZ Both as a Coprecursor and as a Postsynthesis
Modifier
The total HMDZ/TEOS molar ratios employed were comparable
to those used separately as coprecursor and as modifier (0.011, 0.021,
and 0.054) but half added at the condensation stage and half in the
aging solution. The total molar ratio of 0.054 was not exceeded, because
it assures the formation of monoliths when HMDZ acts only as coprecursor:
samples A0.0055–B0.0055-t∞, A0.0105–B0.0105-t∞, and A0.027–B0.027-t∞. The samples were
left to dry without washing (second aging period of t∞) to assure that the total HMDZ remained in the
gel.

Figure 9 and Table 5 condense
the structural information of these samples and compare them with
those obtained for the same HMDZ content as a coprecursor and as a
modifier.

a For comparison, samples Aa and Bb-t∞ are also included.

As
expected, the evolution of the relative intensities of the methyl
related bands follows the HMDZ total content, namely, in the bands
at 863/844 and 756 cm–1 (Figure 9A inset). The quantitative analysis of these
spectra in the 1300–700 cm–1 region (Figure
S3 and Table S3, Supporting Information) confirmed this conclusion because the estimated LHB increases from
1.2 to 4.7 as the total HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio varies from 0.011 to
0.054 (Table 5). The
water contact angles correlate well (27.5°–141.0°),
showing that these hybrid monoliths range from hydrophilic to very
hydrophobic, accompanied by a decrease in the envelope density. Comparison
with the properties of monoliths prepared using the same total amount
of HMDZ but only as a coprecursor (samples Aa) or only as a postsynthesis modifier (samples Bb) is also relevant: in terms of hydrophobicity (LHB
and water contact angle), HMDZ in the double role (series Aa–Bb) is advantageous,
as the organic groups already bonded to the network facilitate diffusion
of the hydrophobizing bath, and so, the same total amount of HMDZ
has a higher silylation yield. The same is not true in terms of density
because the monoliths of series Aa–Bb are lighter than those of series Aa but denser than the corresponding ones of series
Bb. Thus, the amount used as a coprecursor
contributes to denser xerogels, only partially compensated by the
aging in HMDZ solution.

The N2 isotherms (Figure 9B) and the morphological
values obtained from them
(Table 5) highlight
that for a similar aging solution, the pore structure of the resulting
aerogel is determined by its wet network whether it is hybrid or inorganic,
as shown by comparison of samples A0.027–B0.027 and B0.021: the total pore volume and average pore dimension
are higher and the surface area is lower when the wet gel is inorganic.

Comparison of samples with the same total HMDZ content (A0.0105–B0.0105 and B0.021 or A0.027–B0.027 and B0.054) shows that using
all the HMDZ as a postsynthesis modifier results in a lighter hybrid
network with a higher total pore volume, larger pores, and thus lower
surface areas. This is due to a stronger silylation effect of a more
concentrated solution.

On the basis of the above observations,
an approach for preparing
Aa–Bb monoliths was followed, which maximizes hydrophobicity and specific
surface area without a significant increase in density: the aging
solution that yields minimum density in series Bb was used to silylate hybrid networks with various HMDZ contents
and for a period of ∼24 h (samples A0.011–B0.107-t24 and A0.054–B0.107-t24).

The structural and physical properties derived from the infrared
spectra and nitrogen isotherms (Figures S4 and S5, Supporting Information) are compared in Table 6.

a For comparison,
sample B0.214-t24 is also included.

The envelope densities are
similar to those of samples obtained
using a higher HMDZ content as a postsynthesis modifier for 24 h and
are almost insensitive to the HMDZ content as a coprecursor. The prevailing
effect of HMDZ on the envelope density is thus as surface modifier.
Nevertheless, a striking improvement is achieved in terms of superhydrophobicity
and specific surface area of the monoliths using HMDZ in the double
role.

The pore structure is also influenced by the role and
content of
HMDZ: the N2 isotherm of sample A0.054–B0.107-t24 (Figure S4B, Supporting Information) rises rapidly near p/p0 = 1, indicating the presence
of macropores that contribute to a higher total pore volume, with
a decrease in specific surface area.38 The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 10) confirm a more open and three-dimensional
structure of this sample on the macropore scale.

Figure 10 SEM images for samples
Aa–B0.107-t24, as indicated, and sample
B0.214-t24.

On the other hand, sample B0.214-t24 owes the higher total pore volume and lower
surface area
to a larger average dimension of the mesopores. Apparently, when HMDZ
acts as a postsynthesis modifier on a wet structure that has already
a large content in silyl groups, macropores tend to form and remain
upon subcritical drying.

3 Conclusions
Transparent
hybrid silica-based monoliths dried at ambient pressure
were synthesized using minimum amounts of an organic modifier (HMDZ),
ranging from vitreous and dense xerogels to superhydrophobic aerogels.
HMDZ may act as a coprecursor, as a postsynthesis modifier, or as
both.

When HMDZ acts only as a coprecursor, high-density hydrophilic
xerogels with high specific surface areas are obtained. Low contents
must be used because for HMDZ/TEOS molar ratios ≥0.107 the
gels flocculate, resulting in powders instead of monoliths. When HMDZ
acts as a postsynthesis modifier, superhydrophobic aerogels are obtained.
For each HMDZ/TEOS molar ratio, correlations between the aging period
in the silylating solution and density or hydrophobicity were established.
The effect of aging in a hydrophobizing solution until complete drying
is twofold: the trimethylsilyl groups that remain attached to the
surface of the pores contribute not only to increase hydrophobicity
but also to increase the density of the gel. However, if the pore
liquid is replaced by solvent after 24 h, hydrophobization is efficient,
but the entrapped organic molecules are removed and much lighter gels
are resulted. Advantage may be taken from the best of each role using
HMDZ both as a coprecursor and as a postsynthesis modifier, to obtain
superhydrophobic aerogels with high specific surface areas.

The synthesis procedure may be adjusted, depending on whether the
emphasis is on lowering the density, increasing the surface area,
or maximizing superhydrophobicity. The intended applications will
thus dictate the procedure to follow.

4 Materials
and Methods of Characterization
TEOS (98%) from Aldrich was
used as a silica precursor, 2-propanol
p.a. from Sigma-Aldrich as a solvent, HCl (1 M) p.a. from CARLO ERBA
and NH4OH (0.1 M) p.a. from Merck as catalysts, and HMDZ
(99.9%) from Aldrich as a coprecursor and/or an organic modifier.

The molecular structure of the hybrid aerogels was studied by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in a diffuse reflectance mode
(DRIFT), using a Mattson FTIR spectrometer with a Specac Selector,
in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 (wide-band
mercury cadmium telluride detector), at 4 cm–1 resolution.
The spectra were the result of rationing 500 added scans for each
sample against the same number of scans for the background (grinded
KBr).

The pore structure was analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at 77 K of the degassed samples, using a Micromeritics ASAP
2020 instrument. The degassing programs consisted of evacuation (10
mbar) for 60 min at 30 °C and heating for 1200 min at 40 °C.
The volume of nitrogen adsorbed between two consecutive points was
15 cm3·g–1.42 The total time per run varied between 24 and 130 h.

The morphology
of the hybrid aerogel monoliths was observed by
a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The SEM images were recorded
on a FEG-SEM JEOL JSM-7001F instrument operated at an accelerating
voltage of 10 keV. The surfaces of the samples were sputter-coated
with gold prior to analysis.

The envelope densities of the monolithic
aerogels were measured
with a GeoPyc 1360 instrument by Micromeritics, using a consolidation
force of 15 N for 15 measurement cycles. The samples were previously
degassed.

The water contact angle measurements were performed
at room temperature
(22 °C) by placing water droplets (5 μL) on the aerogel
surface and taking several close-up photographs with a Casio EX-F1
EXILIM Pro camera. The contact angle measurements were obtained from
the snapshots using ImageJ 1.45 software.
