==== Body
1 Introduction
Reduction process is a
fundamental and important chemical transformation
in organic synthesis1−3 and industrial chemistry,4−6 the key step
being that the electrons transform from a donor to the target substance.
The reduction of nitroaromatics (NAs) is a common and facile route
to produce aminoaromatics (AAs), which are very significant intermediates
for the synthesis of several nitrogen-containing compounds, such as
agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymers, dyes, pesticides, and cosmetics.7−12 Several toxic NAs are responsible for serious environmental pollutions.13 However, they can be transformed into AAs, that
is, nitrophenol (NP) conversion into harmless aminophenols (AP), which
are potential intermediates for accessing pharmaceuticals and dyes
via the reduction process (Figure 1a). Accordingly, various NAs can be reduced to their
amino counterparts through the use of catalysts wherein the applied
catalysts play a significant role.14−19 Consequently, the suitable design of the catalyst structure and
their prudent selection can remarkably improve the reduction efficiency,
thus providing better catalytic sustainability and recoverability.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
design for the reduction of nitrobenzene with aqueous
NaBH4 using nanocatalysts. (b) Classification of various
nanocatalysts applied for the reduction of NAs to AAs.

The description of the catalysts these days can
be simply and ideally
stated as nanoparticles (NPs) with or without supports. Nanosized
catalysts with high specific surface area and without supports provide
a ready contact with the reactants, thereby improving the catalytic
activity.20−22 However, the high surface energy of nanostructures
escalates their instability and leads to aggregation, which results
in the loss of catalytic activity.23,24 An inevitable
loss of nanocatalysts appears during their tedious separation from
the products. Therefore, the deployment of supports effectively prevents
their aggregation and undesirable lose, thereby enlarging the total
surface area and assuring their sustained catalytic activity and reusability;
the positioning of supports with a high specific surface area generally
provides a promoted adhesion to reactants.25−27

Regarding
the greener aspect of the catalytic processes, it is
highly desirable to develop environmentally benign procedures that
can be conducted preferably in aqueous media, thus avoiding the use
of volatile organic solvents; sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is one such favored water-soluble reductant for representative
reductions.28−30 In the reduction process of NA to AA with aqueous
NaBH4, electrons from BH4– transfer to NA when both of the species are absorbed on the surface
of the catalyst.31−33

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), field
emission SEM (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and infrared radiation (IR) are
the most commonly used characterization techniques for the synthesized
catalysts, whereas ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis)
is a convenient way for monitoring the conversion process; 4-NP has
a typical absorption peak at 317 nm. However, after adding aqueous
NaBH4, a red shift of the maximum absorption peak occurs
immediately from 317 to 400 nm because of the formation of 4-nitrophenolate
ions under alkaline conditions. Thereafter, these peaks at 400 nm
are reduced over time.34−38 Moreover, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry is needed
for the measurement of accurate conversion percentage and for verifying
the ensuing reaction products.39,40

Consequently,
the compatibility of the applied catalysts affects
the overall reduction productivity.41 In
view of their importance, we present recent methods for the synthesis
of nanocatalysts as directed for the reduction of NAs with focus on
the advances in nanostructured catalysts for the hydrogenation of
NA with aqueous NaBH4. The general strategies for the synthesis
of representative heterogeneous nanocatalysts, their advantages, limitation,
and challenges are also discussed. For the sake of differentiation
and ease of understanding, the nanocatalysts are classified with or
without supports for monometal and bi- or multimetal nanostructured
catalysts. Additionally, we have categorized separately the supported
nanocatalysts with and without magnetic properties in view of their
ease of separation and reuse (Figure 1b). The first category of nanocatalysts in this article,
monometallic nanocatalysts, possesses solely one metal element as
the catalyst for expediting the reduction of NAs to AAs. Subsequently,
bimetallic and solid supported non-magnetic nanocatalysts are discussed,
emphasizing on their designs to overcome the low efficiency and aggregation
issues of the monometal nanocatalysts.42 Although these catalysts demonstrate considerably improved catalytic
activity, their reusability is still a challenge. Consequently, the
magnetic nanostructured catalysts are presented to facilitate easy
separation and as sustainable catalysts for reduction of NAs.43

2 Monometallic Nanocatalysts
The decrease in size of metal catalysts having diameters in the
nanometer range ensures high surface area, enhancing their catalytic
performances. Metal NPs have remarkable catalytic susceptibility because
of their adjustable size, shape-associated activity, and selectivity.
Monometal nanocatalysts used in NaBH4 reduction of NAs,
generally, noble- and transition-metal NPs such as palladium (Pd),
platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), and silver (Ag), are synthesized and
directly employed as nanocatalysts in the hydrogenation of various
NAs using aqueous NaBH4 as the reductant.44−49 Effective catalytic achievement can be attained using monometallic
NPs with high surface potential determined by the valence amount of
unsaturated surface atoms and by the Fermi energy level in redox.50−52 The catalytic activity of the Pt NPs has been reported to be highly
dependent on the morphology, porosity, size distribution, and phase
composition; significant enhancement could be discerned in the catalytic
activity when monodispersed Pt NPs are linked into Pt nanowires.53

Mahmoud et al.54 concluded, while reducing
4-NP, that the reaction yield is a function of free surface area of
the NPs. In this study, the mechanism of 4-NP reduction by Au nanocatalysts
was investigated using NaBH4 in solution. The reduction
process can be achieved either on the NP surface following the heterogeneous
mechanisms or by the leached atoms or ions from the NPs (homogeneous
mechanism) in the solution. Considering the plasmonic effect of Au
NPs and measuring the dependence of the reaction yields on the surface
area of the nanocatalyst by the adsorption isotherm of binding 4-NP
and the changes of the plasmonic extinction band position of the NPs
during the reactions, the researchers concluded that it is the surface
heterogeneous-type mechanism and not the homogeneous path by the leached
atoms in the solution (Figure 2) that is involved.

Figure 2 Schematic explanation for the reduction of 4-NP
by NaBH4 catalyzed by Au nanocatalysts. (a) The reaction
is driven rapidly
in the absence of 4-NP. (b) The reaction rate is slower when the surface
of Au nanocatalysts is decreased because of 4-NP binding resulting
in the heterogeneous catalytic mechanism.

Kaur et al.55 also
demonstrated this premise by reducing NA using reusable silver nanocatalysts
and size-controlled copper (Cu) NPs in aqueous medium; hydrogenation
proceeded on the surface of Cu NPs, and the catalytic efficiency increased
as the size of particles decreased (Figure 3). It is believed that the activity of nanocatalysts
would decrease once the exposed surface area is covered.56 However, a long shelf life of Cu NPs could be
attained by coating polyacrylic acid without inhibiting the reduction
activity.

Figure 3 Schematic demonstration of Cu nanocatalysts synthesis.

3 Bi- or Multimetallic Nanocatalysts
This section describes bi-metals of the various alloys as they
appear to exhibit an improved activity compared to the corresponding
monometallic nanocatalysts because of synergetic effects.57 In the case of bi- or multimetallic nanocatalysts,
various electronic interactions between the atomic orbitals of different
metals result in the “volcano-shape” relationship, which
clearly indicates synergistic effects between the metallic sources.58 The extra electrons in the outer orbitals of
the metallic sources having relatively higher activity are capable
of transferring to the adjacent different metallic atoms with relatively
lower activity, culminating in coordination between those different
metallic elements. Consequently, the formed electron-rich metallic
atoms facilitate the electron transfer from the adsorbed BH4– to the 4-NP, enhancing the process efficiency. For instance, Chu
et al.58 reported that polyelectrolyte
multilayer-supported AuPt alloy NPs exhibit higher catalytic activity
than Au and Pt monometallic catalysts for the reduction of 4-NP by
NaBH4.

3.1 Cu–Pd Nanocatalysts
Saikia
et al.59 synthesized Cu–Pd alloy
NPs by stirring CuCl2 and PdCl2 in aqueous NaOH,
followed by injecting the mixed solution into a Teflon cup in a stainless
steel autoclave (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Schematic procedural details for the synthesis of Cu–Pd
nanoalloy.

The prepared Cu-Pd NPs were characterized
using XRD, SEM, energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analyses, and TEM. Figure 5 shows TEM images of the formed
Cu–Pd NPs with below 20 nm size; more than 90% of the NPs fall
in the size range 3–4 nm, while Figure 5d presents the histogram of the NPs with
an average size of 3.3 nm. The reduction activity was characterized
by the hydrogenation reaction of 4-NP to 4-AP in aqueous NaBH4 wherein the use of bimetal Cu–Pd nanocatalysts remarkably
improved the catalysis activity compared to the use of only either
Cu or Pd.

3.2 Pt–Au
Nanocatalysts
Fu et
al.60 synthesized uniformly nanosized Pt–Au
alloy NPs via a one-pot hydrothermal approach for the reduction of
4-NP and compared their catalytic activity with Pt NPs. The prepared
Pt–Au NPs were characterized by TEM and EDS techniques (Figure 6). The uniform square
nanocatalysts had an average size of ∼10 nm as shown in Figure 6a,b. The EDS elemental
mapping results indicate that the Pt–Au NPs consist of alloys
with a uniform elemental distribution rather than a core–shell
structure (Figure 6c,d).

NPs. Reproduced with permission from ref (60).

The catalytic activity of the Pt–Au nanocatalysts
was ascertained
by the reduction of 4-NP solutions with 0.1 M NaBH4 (Figure 7) using a UV–vis
instrument. The reduction period by Pt–Au bimetallic nanocatalysts
(33 min) was shorter than the 51 min by Pt monometallic nanocatalysts,
exhibiting a better catalytic activity for reducing 4-NP.

spectra of 4-NP before and after adding NaBH4 solution.

3.3 Pt–Ni
Nanocatalysts
Ghosh
et al.61 synthesized the bimetallic Pt-Ni
alloyed nanocatalysts by the addition of NiSO4 and H2PtCl6 in cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
micellar medium followed by injection of hydrazine (N2H4) and KOH solution. The catalytic activity of the Pt–Ni
nanocatalysts was evaluated for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP using
aqueous NaBH4 as the reductant. The catalytic reduction
was found to be equally successful for other nitroarenes such as 2-NP
and 4-nitroaniline. The comparative catalytic activity between Raney
Ni and Pt–Ni nanocatalysts showed that the activity of the
Pt–Ni alloy is much higher than that of only Ni and, similarly,
when compared to only Pt nanocatalysts.

3.4 Pt–Ni–Fe
Nanocatalysts
Chen et al.62 synthesized
Pt–Ni–Fe
multimetal heterogeneous nanocatalysts wherein the as-synthesized
Ni–Fe branched-dumbbell-shaped material was synthesized via
electromagnetic wave assistance (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Schematic view for the fabrication of branched-dumbbell
Pt–Ni–Fe
nanocatalysts.

The morphology and structure
of the Pt–Ni–Fe nanocatalysts
were characterized by SEM and TEM. In addition, powder XRD was employed
to characterize the phase structure of the prepared nanocatalysts.
The branched-dumbbell-shaped Pt–Ni–Fe nanocatalysts
presented efficient catalytic activity compared to Ni/Fe branched-dumbbells
and Ni nanocatalysts for the reduction of p-NP; at
least 10 successive cycles of reaction with a conversion efficiency
of ∼97% could be successfully achieved (Figure 9). The as-prepared Ni–Fe and Pt–Ni–Fe
NPs could be easily separated from the solution and recovered using
an external magnet and redispersed in solution for subsequent use.

nanocatalysts. Reproduced with permission from ref (62).

4 Solid-Supported Nonmagnetic Nanocatalysts
Solid supports effectively inhibit the aggregation of active nanocatalysts
compared with unsupported monometal and multimetal nanocatalysts.63−66 In addition, the supports generally offer vast surface area, which
is crucial for the improvement of catalytic efficiency.67−70 Accordingly, significant development has been made in the field
of heterogeneous catalysis by applying strong metal–support
interactions to strengthen catalytic performance.71 The selection of supports is an important issue because
of the synergetic effects between the supports and nanocatalysts,
empowering catalytic processes. For example, conductive support-containing
catalytic NPs may assist electron transfer between nanocatalysts and
reactants/reductants.72 In NA reduction,
the supports also facilitate the adherence of nitro moieties and reductants
to the nanocatalysts, supplying more electron transport channels.
This section explores various supported nanocatalysts applied in the
reduction of NAs in water. In practice, the supported nanocatalysts
display enhanced recycling performance in the reduction of NAs because
of their retainable mechanical properties; supports play an important
role in the proficiency of the catalytic systems.

4.1 Carbon
Nanotube-Supported Nanocatalysts
Wang et al.73 synthesized carbon nanotube
(CNT)-supported Au NPs for the degradation of pollutants via a multistep
approach as shown in Figure 10, including (1) activation of stainless steel mesh, (2) growth
of CNT arrays, (3) synthesis of Au NPs, and (4) attachment of Au NPs
to CNTs. Au NP-decorated CNT-supported materials promoted the catalytic
degradation of p-NP in aqueous NaBH4 solution.

4.2 Mesoporous Silica-Supported Nanocatalysts
Han and co-workers introduced a facile one-step method for the
preparation of Ag-NP-loaded mesoporous silica SBA-15.74 Mesoporous silica and Ag NPs were spontaneously synthesized
with the Ag NPs embedded in the channels, and their catalytic activity
was examined for the reduction of 4-NP in the presence of NaBH4. In an interesting work, Zhang et al.75 synthesized nanotube-shaped silica loaded with silver NPs
using electrospinning technology. TEM images (Figure 11) exhibited the amorphous and extremely
long nanotubes with uniform diameters (250–350 nm) independent
of whether there is loading or nonloading of other active species;
these nanotube catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performances
for the hydrogenation of 4-NP to 4-AP, which has been ascribed to
their high specific surface area.

silica and (b)
nanotube-shaped silica-supported Ag NPs. Reproduced with permission

4.3 Graphene
Oxide-Supported Nanocatalysts
Graphene oxide is one of the
most widely used supports for loading
of nanocatalysts such as Pd, Au, and Ag.76 Ye et al.72 designed Pt–Au NPs,
which were supported on functionalized graphene oxide (Figure 12); the as-synthesized Pt–Au
alloys exhibited a dendrimer-like nanostructure with a small size
of ∼50 nm. The size and morphology of Au NPs could affect the
hydrogenation catalysis.77,78 However, the hydrogenation
activity of Au is usually much lower than Pt-group metals.60 The introduction of engineered graphene oxide-supported
Pt–Au could provide active catalytic sites, improving the electron
transfer, thereby promoting the catalytic activity of the NA reduction.

Figure 12 Synthetic
scheme for Pt–Au nanocatalysts on functionalized
graphene oxide supports for the efficient reduction of 4-NP.

Chen et al.79 synthesized a graphene
oxide-supported CdS hybrid photosensitive catalyst via the electrostatic
interaction of negatively charged graphene and positively charged
CdS NPs for the light-assisted reduction of NA (Figure 13). The CdS/graphene hybrid
nanocatalysts demonstrated a high reductive activity presumably via
the synergistic effect emanating from CdS and graphene oxide, which
provided a high transfer rate of electrons for the reduction of NA
to AA. The intimate interfacial contact via an electrostatic self-assembly
strategy promoted the carrier transfer at the CdS/graphene hybrid
nanocatalysts upon irradiation of visible light, thus providing enhancement
of the photocatalytic performance for the selective reduction of 4-NAs.
The introduction of graphene increased the work function of the electrons,
which were generated from CdS NPs upon irradiation of visible light.
In addition, the deployment of graphene also contributes to the enhancement
in the concentration of the NAs on the graphene surface, which effectively
accelerates the catalytic hydrogenation.

Figure 13 Schematic procedure
for the electrostatic self-assembly of CdS/graphene
hybrid nanocatalysts.

In another effort, Zhang and colleagues introduced a facile
method
to decorate Pd nanocatalysts on the graphene oxide surface80 by a simple mixing process in aqueous Pluronic
F–127 as a mild reductant at room temperature (Figure 14). TEM images confirmed the
good distribution of Pd NPs on graphene oxide (Figure 15). The prepared catalyst converted NAs to
AAs in aqueous NaBH4 in a short reaction time.

graphene oxide.

oxide. (b) TEM and (c, d) HRTEM images

4.4 Carbon
Nitride-Supported Nanocatalysts
Bhowmik et al.81 reported the synthesis
of carbon nitride-supported ultrasmall Au NPs for the reduction of
4-NP in aqueous medium, which showed an excellent catalytic activity
and good stability. The nanocatalysts were characterized by TEM (Figure 16), selected area
electron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, powder
X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methods.

Figure 16 (a)
TEM images of carbon nitride and (b) Au–carbon nitride
nanocomposite catalyst. Reproduced with permission from ref (81).

The morphology of the formed carbon nitride (Figure 16a) shows two-dimensional carbon
nitride sheets. Figure 16b exhibits the uniform dispersion of Au NPs with a mean size
of 1.5 nm on the carbon nitride sheets demonstrating highly loaded
Au NPs. The reduction measurement of 4-NP to 4-AP was completed by
employing aqueous NaBH4 as the reductant, monitored by
UV-vis spectra absorption, with the reduction time being remarkably
shortened, ∼15 s to complete the reduction. Li and his research
group78 reported a similar finding for
the reduction of 4-NP with mesoporous carbon nitride-supported Au
NPs, showing 96% conversion using aqueous NaBH4 in 5 min.
The catalyst could be recycled by centrifugation, exhibiting at least
five successive cycles with high conversion efficiency. Graphitic
carbon nitrides are readily obtainable starting from urea or melamine
or a mixture thereof.82

4.5 Polymer-Supported Nanocatalysts
Sreedhar
et al.83 synthesized Pt NPs supported on
gum acacia, which were characterized by TEM, XRD, XPS, and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); the amount of Pt NPs in the
formed heterogeneous catalyst was determined by using inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The strong
interactions of NPs with functional molecular groups of gum acacia
resulted in the formation of monodispersed NPs; catalytic activity
of the catalyst was also compared with Pt/C, Pt-Al2O3, and Pt-ZrO2 in the reduction of nitrobenzene.
The results (Table 1) showed an enhanced activity of gum acacia-supported Pt nanocatalysts
because of the high surface area and strong hydrogen trapping property
of Pt NPs. Furthermore, the nanocatalysts could be reused several
times with moderate loss in catalytic activity (Table 2). Stable anchoring of Pt NPs on gum acacia
was robustly maintained after recyclization measurement. The renewable
gums obtained from various trees are relatively untapped resources,
although they have been used as food additives for a while.84

4.6 Polyelectrolyte Multilayer-Supported
Nanocatalysts
Chu et al.85 synthesized
Au–Pt
alloy NPs supported on polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) for the
reduction of 4-NP using aqueous NaBH4; the ensuing nanocatalysts
were analyzed by ICP-AES and were found to be well-dispersed Au–Pt
alloy NPs with a narrow size distribution in the polymer matrices.
The reduction process was tracked using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
taking ∼6 min to achieve the hydrogenation of 4-NP. The optimal
synergistic effect of Au/Pt was identified to be 2:1. The PEM-supported
Au–Pt alloy NPs exhibited higher catalytic activity than Au
and Pt monometallic NPs for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH4, presenting synergistic effects between Au and Pt.

5 Supported Magnetic Nanocatalysts
The magnetic nanocatalysts
have a comparative advantage as they
provide easier separation from the reaction media with less catalyst
loss by simply using an external magnet.86 The nanocatalyst separation and reuse by magnetic field is an important
factor for commercial manufacture and attaining cost effective reductions.87 However, there are also some disadvantages including
the material selection for synthesizing appropriate nanocatalysts.
The limited availability of model magnetic nanocatalysts for the catalytic
processes restricts their practical applications. Therefore, many
scientists have pursued various strategies to develop ideal magnetic
nanocatalysts.88

5.1 Nanocatalysts
Decorated on Iron Oxide NPs
Patra et al.89 synthesized Ag/Fe2O3 nanocatalysts
for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes;
hydrothermally formed Fe2O3 NPs were obtained
by admixing sodium salicylate with NaOH, followed by injection of
aqueous Fe(NO3)3. Subsequently, the Ag NPs were
deposited on the surface of the Fe2O3. The FESEM
images (Figure 17)
of the prepared magnetic nanocatalysts indicated the identical bitruncated-octahedron-shaped
Fe2O3 NPs with a length of ∼310 nm, a
width of ∼220 nm, and a height of ∼150 nm and a well-dispersed coating of Ag NPs on the surface.

Figure 17 FESEM images
of magnetic NPs (a) before and (b) after Ag NP decoration.

The catalytic activity was explored via the hydrogenation
of 2
mL of aqueous 0.1 mmol/L 4-NP with 200 μL of 10 mmol/L aqueous
NaBH4 at 500 μL of 1 mg/mL aqueous nanocatalysts.
The reduction process required ∼10 min for the complete conversion
of 4-NP to 4-AP. The reusability of Ag/Fe2O3 NPs in the hydrogenation reaction was measured for 10 cycles using
4-NP as a reference, which exhibited a good catalytic activity and
almost no obvious deactivation after 10 times of cyclic hydrogenation.
The Ag/Fe2O3 nanocatalysts also successfully
reduced other functionalized NAs such as 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which
is a challenging proposition because of the presence of carboxylic
acid groups (Table 3). Similarly, Pelisson et al.90 prepared
maghemite-supported Pd NPs nanocatalysts for the reduction of nitro
aromatics to amino aromatics with aqueous NaBH4.

Table 3 Magnetic Ag/Fe2O3 Nanocatalysts
for Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes in the Presence of
NaBH4 for 30 min
5.2 Nanocatalysts Decorated on Carbon-Coated Magnetic
NPs
An et al.91 synthesized Fe3O4@carbon-supported Ag–Au nanocatalysts
and studied the effect of the Ag/Au ratio on the catalytic activity
in the hydrogenation of NAs (Figure 18). Remarkably, this work showed that the use of carbon
can contribute to both the improvement of catalytic performance of
the noble metals and in situ preparation of Ag-Au bimetallic nanocatalysts.
Catalytic reduction of 4-NP by aqueous NaBH4 using Fe3O4@C@Ag–Au nanocatalysts, monitored by UV–vis
spectra absorption, showed significant enhancement in the catalytic
activity (4.5 min).

Figure 18 Schematic diagram for the fabrication of magnetic metal
oxide@C@Ag–Au
nanocatalysts.

The recycling ability
of the Fe3O4@C@Ag–Au
nanocatalysts was verified with high yields in six reaction cycles.
Similarly, Zhang et al.92 prepared Pt–Pd
nanoalloys supported on Fe3O4@C core–shell
NPs using a facile two-step synthesis method (Figure 19) and characterized them by high-resolution
TEM; Pt–Pd nanocatalyst decoration on a carbon layer coating
on the surface of the Fe3O4 NPs was discerned.
In another exploration, Du et al.93 synthesized
Pt–Pd NPs on super-paramagnetic core–shell nanocatalysts
for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP using aqueous NaBH4.
The hydrogenation required 22 min to completely convert the 4-NP to
4-AP using 13.63 wt % of the prepared nanocatalysts; the yield and
selectivity were obtained to be 96% and 99%, respectively.

Figure 19 Schematic
procedure for the preparation of Pt–Pd NPs on
magnetic core–shell nanocatalysts.

5.3 Nanocatalysts Decorated on Polymer-Encapsulated
Magnetic NPs
Various nanocatalysts can be adorned on the
polymer shell containing magnetic NPs. The polymer layers can protect
the magnetic NPs from dissolution and corrosion in the reaction environment.
Ayad et al.94 synthesized silver nanocatalysts
decorated on a polyaniline–chitosan–magnetite (Ag@PANI-CS-Fe3O4) nanocomposite catalyst for the hydrogenation
of 4-NP by aqueous NaBH4 (Figure 20).

Figure 20 Synthetic strategy for the preparation of Ag@PANI-CS-Fe3O4 nanocomposite catalyst.

The Ag@PANI-CS-Fe3O4 nanocomposite
catalyst
successfully reduced 4-NP under aqueous NaBH4 reaction
conditions as monitored by UV–vis spectrophotometry, which
confirmed rapid hydrogenation of 4-NP to 4-AP in less than 10 min;
the magnetic catalysts remained active with an efficacy of 95% in
the fourth cycle. By using a similar technique, Zeng et al.95 synthesized Fe3O4@polydopamine
(PDA)–Au nanocatalysts, which were characterized using TEM,
indicating the presence of Au NPs on the core surface of the polymer
shell. The aqueous o-nitroaniline solution could
be reduced in 7 min using a small amount of Fe3O4@PDA–Au nanocomposite catalyst. In this work, PDA effectively
protected the iron oxide and Au NPs from the aggregation in the solution.
The core–shell catalyst also displayed good catalytic activity
for various nitrobenzene reductions (Table 4).

Table 4 Reduction of Various
Nitrobenzenes
Using Fe3O4@PDA–Au Nanocatalysts
Shokouhimehr and colleagues96 prepared
a magnetically retrievable nanocomposite adorned with Pd nanocatalysts,
which was applied for the reduction of NAs in aqueous NaBH4 solution. Pyrrole monomers were polymerized in the presence of Pd
precursors and iron nanopowder forming Pd NPs on the polypyrrole framework
without the requirement of an additional reductant (Figure 21).

TEM and FESEM images of the prepared magnetic catalysts showed
uniform ∼2 nm Pd NPs accommodated discretely on the polypyrrole
layer of the prepared nanocomposite (Figure 22). The nanocomposite catalyst could be easily
separated and recycled using a small magnet and reused for seven consecutive
cycles of high-yield reduction of nitrobenzene (99–95%) in
aqueous NaBH4 solution.

Magnetic core–shell nanocatalysts
have been utilized for hydrogenation reactions without any support.97 For example, a Ag@Ni nanocatalyst was prepared
via a simple one-pot synthesis, which catalyzed the reduction of NAs.98 However, the application of mesoporous silica
(mSiO2) is an important issue for heterogeneous catalysis
because of their excellent stability, high surface area, tunable pore
size, and chemical inertness. Yao et al.99 prepared the FexOy/Pd@mSiO2 magnetic NPs consisting of a movable
FexOy core
and mesoporous mSiO2 (Figure 23). The Fe3O4@C NPs
were prepared by mixing glucose and Fe3O4 NPs
in water followed by heating at 200 °C in an autoclave for 8
h. The Fe3O4@C/Pd was prepared by adding the
Fe3O4@C in PdCl2 ethanol solution,
followed by injecting NH2NH2 and washing the
ensuing products. Finally, the mSiO2 on the surface was
formed by using tetraethyl orthosilicate and CTAB, followed by calcination
at 600 °C. The obtained product was characterized by SEM, TEM,
FT-IR, and UV–vis.

Figure 23 Scheme of the preparation of FexOy/Pd@mSiO2 nanocomposite catalyst.

The catalytic activity of the core–shell nanocomposite
catalyst
was verified for the reduction of NAs, which was accomplished in ∼40
min; successive recycling of 4-NP reduction was achieved with the
conversion of ∼100% for each cycle (Figure 24).

Figure 24 Conversion of 4-NP in 10 successive cycles
using FexOy/Pd@mSiO2 catalyst.

Wang et al.100 designed a mesoporous
silica for loading core–shell Ni@Pd nanocatalysts exhibiting
high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of 4-NP. Dong et al.101 designed a silica sphere with a dandelion-like
shape, which was decorated with Ni@Pd nanocatalysts for the reduction
of 4-NP and 4-chlorophenol (Figure 25). The silica spheres with a size of 200–300
nm efficiently inhibited the aggregation of Ni@Pd NPs providing an
extensive accessibility for the hydrogenation of NAs. The magnetically
separable catalysts can be promising candidates for important organic
conversions and industrial applications.102

6 Conclusions
Recent advancements in
the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics to aminoaromatics,
catalyzed by various nanocatalysts using aqueous NaBH4 as
a reductant, are summarized with representative examples of the mono-
and multimetal supported and magnetic nanocatalysts. Promising catalytic
efficiency has been attained by designing the catalysts with high
specific surface area and good protection of the active nanocatalysts.
However, substantial challenges still persist for the large-scale
production, which requires cost efficiency and a capability to sustain
considerable recycling operation. The synthesis of sustainable nanocatalysts
needs further innovative strategies and developments to solve the
current limitations such as aggregation, recyclability, stability,
and durability.
