Epithelial
ovarian cancer is a deadly gynecologic malignancy because
of its late detection, usually after local and distant metastatic
spread. These cancers develop resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic
agents; therefore, the development of next-generation immunotherapeutic
approaches may have a significant promise in improving outcomes. A
novel immunotherapeutic approach utilizing combination radiation therapy
(RT) with immunostimulatory cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) was tested
in a preclinical syngeneic mouse model of ovarian carcinoma. ID8-Defb29/Vegf
tumors were generated in C57BL/6 mice. Compared to placebo-treated
control tumors or those treated with a single agent RT or CPMV, the
combination treatment resulted in a significantly improved tumor growth
delay (p < 0.05). Additionally, immunohistochemical
profiling of tumor samples after treatment with CPMV demonstrated
an increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These results
suggest that utilizing CPMV particles in combination with RT can turn
an immunologically “cold” tumor (with low number of
TILs) into an immunologically “hot” tumor. This novel
combination treatment approach of RT and CPMV demonstrated the ability
to control tumor growth in a preclinical ID8 ovarian cancer model,
showing promise as an in situ tumor vaccine and warrants further testing.

1 Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC) remains the deadliest gynecologic
malignancy, with an estimated 22 400 new cases in 2017 in the
US, resulting in 14 000 deaths.1 Despite progress with newer agents, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
inhibitors and peritoneal chemotherapy, which have been shown to improve
progression-free survival and response rates in this disease, the
overall survival remains dismal.1 One of
the main difficulties for improving survival in EOC is that while
most patients initially respond to traditional platinum-based chemotherapies,
resistance inevitably develops. There are few effective alternative
agents.

Therefore, newer treatment regimens are needed to improve
outcomes
in patients with locally advanced ovarian cancer. One strategy that
has been investigated in a variety of solid tumors, including EOC,
is the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors to potentiate an adaptive
host T-cell-based immune response against cancer cells. Therapeutic
antibodies targeted to the programmed death receptor one (PD1) or
its ligand [programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1)] have produced partial
response rates of 20% in early-phase clinical trials in platinum-resistant
ovarian cancer.2,3 However, complete responses that
have been seen using these agents in melanoma remain elusive. A key
challenge that the checkpoint therapies fail to address is the recruitment
of T cells into an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment; that
is, while checkpoint inhibitors take the “brakes off”
T cells, the therapeutic regimen does not promote local immune stimulation
and required immune cell infiltration into the tumor.3−5

In situ vaccination approaches have shown great promise to
overcome
and relieve tumor-mediated local immune suppression. The idea behind
in situ vaccination is that an immune-stimulatory agent is introduced
into an identified tumor to promote first innate, then adaptive, immune
infiltration and activation, essentially turning an immunologically
“cold” tumor into a “hot” tumor and thus
priming the patient’s own immune system against the tumor.
Optimally, this leads to a boost in systemic antitumor immunity to
attack untreated tumors of the same type. A number of strategies are
being explored, such as a stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING)
pathway agonist6,7 and viral in situ vaccination.8,9 For example, Talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) is a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved oncolytic and immune-stimulatory (through
expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) therapy
approved as in situ vaccine for the treatment of melanoma.10

Our group has developed an in situ vaccination
approach using virus-like
nanoparticles derived from the plant virus cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV).11 In previous work, we demonstrated efficacy across
various mouse tumor models; our data indicate that the plant viral
in situ vaccine acts in part to activate intratumoral neutrophils
which in turn lead to immune-mediated, systemic and memory responses
against tumors, including melanoma, colon cancer, breast cancer, and
ovarian cancer. Specifically, weekly intraperitoneal (IP) treatment
with CPMV has been shown to significantly improve survival after IP
tumor challenge with a hyperaggressive clone of ID8 epithelial mouse
ovarian cancer cells compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated
controls.11

Nevertheless, although
these studies highlight the potential of
plant viral nanoparticles as in situ vaccines, immunotherapy as monotherapy
is generally effective only against small tumors, and most patients
do not respond to single-approach immunotherapy.5 Combining multiple treatment regimes, however, could form
the basis for success. Therefore, in the present work, we examined
the combination of CPMV in situ vaccination with radiation therapy
(RT). We hypothesized that the combination of RT with our CPMV in
situ vaccine would enhance the antitumor effect. Specifically, the
hypothesis is that RT would debulk the tumor to provide a burst of
tumor antigens in the context of immunogenic cell death that fosters
specific immune recognition and response to those antigens;12 in turn, CPMV-mediated immune stimulation would
further augment antitumor immunity to protect from outgrowth of metastases
and recurrence of the disease. Here, we report a test of this hypothesis
using a mouse model of serous ovarian cancer.

2 Results
2.1 Tumor Growth Delay
Subcutaneous ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A-Luc
tumors in C57BL/6 female mice were treated with RT, in situ vaccine
(CPMV), both RT + CPMV, or PBS (placebo group); treatment was begun
when tumors reached a volume of 100–150 mm3. RT
(10 Gy) was given in a single session on day 0, whereas the CPMV treatment
was repeated 5 times in weekly intervals starting on day 1 (Figure 1A). As evidenced
by tumor volume measurements, the tumor growth was delayed after day
5 in both RT arms compared to the arms receiving CPMV alone or PBS
(p < 0.05) (Figure 1B). From day 18 post-RT through the end of the study,
the combination of RT + CPMV produced significantly greater tumor
growth delay than did RT alone (p < 0.05). Tumor
volumes of animals treated with RT + CPMV combination were on average
2–3× smaller than those measured for animals receiving
the RT alone; and this difference was apparent 14 days post-treatment
(Figure 1B).

Tumor growth as assessed by bioluminescence
showed similar results,
with the RT and RT + CPMV arms having significantly reduced (p < 0.05) tumor burden compared to the arms receiving
CPMV alone or PBS (Figure 1C). There was also a trend toward a reduction in the luminescence
counts in the combination RT + CPMV arm compared to the RT alone arm
(p = 0.06). Although we previously observed a potent
efficacy of CPMV in situ as solo therapy in early-stage IP disseminated
ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A in C57BL/6 mice,11 in
the present study, we did not observe the same efficacy using the
same dose of CPMV administered directly into the subcutaneous tumors.

2.2 Tumor Immune Cell Infiltration
Tumor
immune cell infiltration was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
on samples of tumors recovered on day 2 and 11, following treatment
with RT, CPMV, RT + CPMV, or PBS (Figure 2). Early-stage PBS-treated tumors (volumes
of 100–150 mm3) did not reveal significant levels
of CD4- or CD8-positive cells. By day 11, the untreated later-stage
tumors (volumes of ∼500 mm3) showed some degree
of CD4- or CD8-positive cells; however, compared to other treatment
groups, this level of T cell infiltration was minimal. By day 2, 24
h after the start of CPMV treatment, a modest CD4-positive infiltrate
was seen in tumors treated with RT or CPMV alone or in combination,
with no significant CD8-positive effector immune cell infiltrate in
any group at that time. In contrast, 10 days following initiation
of CPMV treatment, both the CPMV alone group and the RT + CPMV group
showed significant infiltration of CD8-positive effector immune cells,
in addition to the CD4-positive immune infiltrate. The lymphocyte
infiltration was observed only in groups exposed to CPMV or RT + CPMV
and not in those given RT alone or PBS. While quantitative studies
were not carried out, there appears to be a trend toward a greater
lymphocyte infiltration into RT + CPMV-treated tumors than into tumors
treated with CPMV alone (Figure 2).

3 Discussion
Ovarian cancer remains difficult to treat and a deadly malignancy
even with the advent of new therapeutic approaches and novel drug
agents. Therefore, the initial promise of newer immunotherapy paradigms
is of significant interest. In our study, we examined a novel immunotherapeutic
viral nanoparticle, CPMV, which has previously been shown to be an
effective in situ vaccination strategy in a syngeneic mouse ID8 ovarian
cancer model.11 Although we previously
observed high potency of the CPMV in situ vaccine in early-stage metastatic
disseminated disease,11 the CPMV monotherapy
had no apparent effect on the growth of subcutaneous tumors derived
from the same cell line (ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A) (Figure 1). This difference may be explained by the
fact that in our previous study early-stage disease was treated, that
is, the CPMV in situ vaccine was given as early as 3 days post-IP
ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A cell injection. In contrast, in the present study,
mice were treated ∼10–14 days post-ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A
cell injection when subcutaneous tumors reached a volume of 100–150
mm3. Differences in tumor burden at the time of treatment
and the different anatomical locations may both explain the difference
in response to CPMV monotherapy.

Another difference between
our earlier work and the present study
is the fact that we used a nucleic-acid-free, viruslike particle of
CPMV, termed “empty” CPMV (eCPMV), for the treatment
of early-stage, IP tumors,11 whereas the
present study used nucleic-acid-containing CPMV particles to treat
later-stage subcutaneous tumors. CPMV contains a bipartite RNA genome,
with RNA-1 and RNA-2 encapsulated separately into virions of identical
protein composition. The RNA cargo may affect the type of immune response
induced; RNA is an immune-stimulatory danger-associated molecular
pattern known to stimulate innate immune responses through Toll-like
receptor signaling. Although others reported the encapsulated RNA
in the plant viruslike nanoparticle derived from papaya mosaic virus
to be beneficial in triggering an antitumor immune response,33 the underlying mechanism of immune stimulation
comparing different plant virus-based nanoparticles of different geometry
and molecular composition remains to be elucidated. It cannot be ruled
out that RNA-containing CPMV and nucleic-acid-free eCPMV have distinct
potencies based on differences in immune activation. Our laboratory
is investigating this question, but this is beyond the present study.

Nevertheless, even though the potency of CPMV monotherapy was less
profound than in our previous animal model treated with eCPMV, luminescence
measurements indicated reduced disease burden for CPMV versus PBS
control groups at the conclusion of the study (Figure 1C). The reduced disease burden at the endpoint
and the observation of immune cell infiltration into the tumor tissue
upon CPMV in situ vaccination indicate that animals with the subcutaneous
ID8 tumors indeed responded to the treatment, although dosing may
be suboptimal. It is clear that dosing and administration schedules
need to be optimized for each disease model; however, this was beyond
the scope of the present study. In fact, the suboptimal dosing was
advantageous to allow testing of RT + CPMV combination therapy. ID8
ovarian tumors are known to be radiosensitive;16 thus, it was expected that RT alone would produce a tumor
growth delay. Nevertheless, the combination treatment, RT + CPMV in
situ vaccine, resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth compared
to RT or CPMV treatment alone. These findings were also confirmed
by our bioluminescence studies (Figure 1B,C).

There are several mechanisms by which RT
can improve the efficacy
of immunotherapeutic agents, including inducing immunogenic cell death,12 enhancing release of neoantigens,17 altering the tumor cell phenotype,18−20 and stimulating the immune system via the STING pathway and IFN
signaling.21,22 The mechanism of cell death traditionally
attributed to radiation is the mitotic catastrophe or p53-mediated
intrinsic pathway apoptosis.23 However,
radiation can also upregulate CD95/Fas, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand, and TNF alpha death receptor pathways involved
in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.24,25 Upregulation
of CD95/Fas on tumor cells has been shown to improve tumor cell kill
by CD8+ T lymphocytes.26 In
addition to enhancing immune-mediated cell death, radiation has also
been shown to alter tumor cell phenotype. Tumor cells often downregulate
major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) to evade the immune system.
However, radiation exposure can also elicit a TNF and IFN response
that results in MHC-I upregulation on tumor cells, as well as increased
ICAM-1 expression, to improve the binding and interaction of T cells
with MHC-I in multiple patient-derived human EOC cell lines.20 Moreover, tumor cells exposed to radiation have
been shown to have a greater diversity of antigens presented on their
surface MHC-I molecules.27 Finally, radiation
itself can induce an inflammatory response via the Cgas/STING pathway
either via cytosolic DNA or via DNA double-strand breaks within micronuclei.21,28 Although activation of this pathway may initially lead to a cytotoxic
T-cell-mediated antitumor response, IFN-mediated immune-suppressive
pathways are also activated with recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor
cells,29 regulatory T cells (Tregs),30 and induction of tumor cell PDL1 expression.31

In contrast to RT, which has been exhaustively
studied, CPMV is
a novel immunotherapeutic agent and to date, we have limited data
surrounding its mechanism of immune activation. Our IHC results demonstrate
that CPMV with or without RT can increase both CD4+ and
CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In our study, we targeted
relatively “cold”, well-established tumors; although
CPMV monotherapy did not show apparent efficacy over placebo-treated
control groups, IHC data indicate that CPMV alone recruits large numbers
of T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells. Although CPMV clearly
initiates an immune response, the inflammatory response that it generates
in this model likely recruits both effector and immunosuppressive
cells. It is possible that a significant number of recruited CD4+ T cells are CD4+ T regulatory cells that are strongly
immunosuppressive through multiple mechanisms. If this is the case,
it likely explains why CPMV alone had minimal effect on tumor growth
in this model, in that both effector and suppressive T cells are being
recruited, and the regulatory T cells can limit effector T cell antitumor
responses. Exposure to RT prior to CPMV in situ vaccination may help
shift the balance toward a more cytotoxic immune response. Detailed
time-dependent phenotyping of recruited T cells would better elaborate
how and when the T cell subsets are recruited to these tumors in response
to various treatments. An alternative possibility that was not explored
is that the innate cell responses which can also be immunosuppressive
or immunostimulatory were tilted toward immunosuppressive with CPMV
alone but were altered toward immunostimulation in combination with
RT.

Although our results demonstrated significantly improved
tumor
growth delay, as measured both by tumor volume and by bioluminescence,
we were unable to achieve complete tumor regression, even in the RT
+ CPMV arm. Future optimization of dosing and administration schedule
is expected to further increase efficacy. Another possible approach
to improve our treatment paradigm would be to add a checkpoint inhibitor
to eradicate suppressive regulatory T cells prior to priming with
RT and initiating an effector immune response with CPMV. Anti-CTLA4
treatments have previously been shown to eradicate regulatory T cells
and help illicit a robust immune response in syngeneic mouse breast
cancer models.32 Therefore, anti-CTLA4
checkpoint blockade may also eradicate suppressive regulatory T cells
in our ovarian cancer model and hence remove suppressive immune cell
barriers prior to RT and CPMV. Furthermore, the checkpoint blockade
has been shown to synergize with viral immunotherapy.33 It is thought that the viral in situ vaccination approach
augments other immunotherapies by expanding antigen-specific T cells.

4 Conclusions
We have demonstrated the potent efficacy
of RT + CPMV in a mouse
model of serous ovarian cancer. Data indicate that the combination
of RT + CPMV enhances efficacy over RT alone, and that this may be
attributed to expansion of T cells within the tumors. Although it
is clear that more studies are needed on the mechanism(s) of immune
activation by CPMV and other viral nanotechnologies, our data indicate
this to be a promising immunotherapy. In situ vaccination with plant-derived
viral nanotechnologies has advantages over mammalian vectors or systemically
administered checkpoint blockade: plant virus-based nanotechnologies
are not infectious toward mammals; the localized treatment is safer
than systemic administration of immunotherapeutic reagents; and there
is no requirement to identify antigens in the tumor or relate those
antigens to the patient’s human leukocyte antigen. The combination
of the viral in situ vaccine with RT may be a particularly powerful
strategy because RT debulks tumors, providing a burst of tumor antigens
in the context of immunogenic cell death, therefore, synergizing with
the CPMV in situ immune stimulation that further augments antitumor
immunity.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Preparation
of CPMV Nanoparticles
CPMV was propagated in black-eyed pea
plants (Vigna
unguiculata) and isolated using previously reported
protocols.13

5.2 Cells
The highly aggressive murine
ovarian cancer cell line ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A14 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 U penicillin/streptomycin. The
cells were stably transfected with luciferase to enable in vivo tracking.
Luciferase was expressed using vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein
(VSVG) retroviral transduction of pBabe, and luciferase-expressing
cells were selected with puromycin. In brief, plasmids VSVG and pBabe-puro-Luc
(10 μg each) were added to GP2-293 packaging cells at 40% confluency
in a 75 cm2 flask (maintained in 7 mL of complete Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium) following a 30 min incubation with
60 μL of TransIT (Mirus). GP2-293 cells and plasmids were a
generous gift from Dr. William Schiemann, Case Western Reserve University.
Following a 48 h incubation, the medium was collected, filtered to
remove cellular debris, and added to ID8-Defb29/Vegf cells in the
presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SCBT))
in a ratio of 50:50 with modified RPMI 1640 medium typically used
with this cell line. ID8-Defb29/Vegf cells were incubated with retroviral
particles for 24 h and allowed to recover in fresh medium for an additional
24 h; cells expressing the plasmid were selected with puromycin for
5 days (5 μg/mL medium, SCBT). Expression of luciferase was
confirmed by IVIS Spectrum BLI (PerkinElmer) imaging of cells in a
96-well plate in the presence of 15 μg of luciferin/well. Measured
luminescence was found to be linearly correlated with cell number
in the range of 5000–500 000 cells per well. The resultant
cell line is referred to as ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A-Luc.

5.3 Tumor Model
Animal studies were carried
out using IACUC-approved protocols. Female C57BL/6 mice were obtained
from Jackson Labs and used in these experiments at 8–10 weeks
of age. Mice were shaved, and 5 million ID8-Defb29/Vegf-A-Luc cells
in a 50:50 mixture of PBS cell suspension and matrigel were injected
subcutaneously in the right flank. Once tumors were approximately
100–150 mm3, mice were randomized into four treatment
groups (n = 4): radiation (RT) alone, RT + CPMV,
CPMV alone, and PBS placebo injections. RT was delivered on day 0
via a Cs-137 irradiator (Shepard Mark I; dose rate ∼2.75 Gy/min)
to a total dose of 10 Gy with a source aligned with the tumor and
the rest of the animal shielded with lead blocks. On day 1 and then
once weekly for a total of five treatments, 100 μg of CPMV in x μL of PBS or the same volume of PBS were injected
intratumorally. Tumor growth was monitored using caliper measurements
as well as by luminescence imaging of the luciferase-expressing cancer
cells. For the latter, mice were injected intraperitoneally with luciferin
(15 mg/mL, 150 μL) and imaged 5 min post-injection with a 3
min exposure time using a PerkinElmer IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging
system. Total luminescence was determined using Living Image software,
and total counts per mouse were graphed.

5.4 Immunohistochemistry
Primary antibody for CD4 was purchased from TONBO Biosciences,
purified
antimouse CD4 (clone GK1.5) and CD8 from eBioscience, and purified
antimouse CD8a (clone 53-6.7). IHC was performed on tumor sections
from the mice of each treatment group to characterize and quantify
tumor immune cell infiltrate on day 1 and 10, following the initiation
of treatment using a previously established protocol.15 Briefly, tumors were surgically dissected and immediately
cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound. Tissue sections
were microsectioned and plated on slides. Frozen sections on slides
were fixed with acetone and washed with PBS, and then antigen blocking
was performed with 5% (v/v) rabbit serum. Next, primary antibodies
were added to coat the tissue sample and allowed to incubate at 4
°C overnight. Slides were then washed with PBS and stained with
immPRESS HRP anti-rat IgG peroxidase polymer detection kit (Vector
Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
solution. Sections were also stained with hematoxylin and washed with
PBS, dehydrated with ethanol, cleaned with xylene, and finally permanently
mounted. Slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 inverted
high-resolution microscope with motorized stage.
