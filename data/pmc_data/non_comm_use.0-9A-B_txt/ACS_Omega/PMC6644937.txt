The
room-temperature formation of bismuth oxycarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) from Bi2O3 in
sodium carbonate buffer was investigated with in situ powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in combination with electron microscopy and
vibrational spectroscopy. Time-resolved PXRD measurements indicate
a pronounced and rather complex pH dependence of the reaction mechanism.
Bi2O2CO3 formation proceeds within
a narrow window between pH 8 and 10 via different mechanisms. Although
a zero-dimensional nucleation model prevails around pH 8, higher pH
values induce a change toward a diffusion-controlled model, followed
by a transition to regular nucleation kinetics. Ex situ synthetic
and spectroscopic studies confirm these trends and demonstrate that
in situ monitoring affords vital parameter information for the controlled
fabrication of Bi2O2CO3 materials.
Furthermore, the β → α bismuth oxide transformation
temperatures of Bi2O2CO3 precursors
obtained from different synthetic routes differ notably (by min 50
°C) from commercially available bismuth oxide. Parameter studies
suggest a stabilizing role of surface carbonate ions in the as-synthesized
bismuth oxide sources. Our results reveal the crucial role of multiple
preparative history parameters, especially of pH value and source
materials, for the controlled access to bismuth oxide-based catalysts
and related functional compounds.

Introduction
The depletion of fossil
fuel resources along with increasing worldwide
climate and water pollution issues raises the urgent demand for low-cost
photocatalytic materials for solar fuel production and water cleaning.
Bismuth oxide-related materials have emerged as a growing family of
attractive environmental research targets.1 Among them, bismuth oxycarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) keeps attracting interdisciplinary interest due to its manifold
properties. They are linked to its Sillén-type layered structure
consisting of [Bi2O2]2+ layers interleaved
by slabs comprising CO32–.2−9 Bi2O2CO3 excels through high photocatalytic
activity in waste water cleaning or NOx removal,2−6,8−16 and it furthermore exhibits a large nonlinear optical effect,4,17 humidity sensing properties,7 and antibacterial
activity.18

Therefore, several synthetic
routes to obtain Bi2O2CO3 nanomaterials
have been reported, and many
of them are based on small organic molecules as CO32– sources, such as urea4,5,12,13 or citrate.4,5,10,13−16 In comparison, we developed an economic and environmentally friendly
room-temperature route to Bi2O2CO3 using β-Bi2O3 as starting material.
This route offers additional options for chemical CO2 capture
and storage.7 The formation pathway of
Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets most likely proceeds
via bismuth hydroxide (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 as an intermediate species. CO2 is dissolved in water
and forms CO32– that diffuses to the
surface of Bi2O3, where a plausible reaction
mechanism can take place via heterogeneous nucleation of (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 and Bi2O2CO3 (cf. eqs 1 and 2). In the final step, intermediate (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 is transformed into Bi2O2CO3 (eq 3)7 1   2   3  Generally, photocatalytically active materials
show a strong influence of their morphology and crystallinity on the
catalytic activity.4,14,19,20 However, comparably little is still known
about the role of these key parameters in Bi2O2CO3 fabrication.14 In an earlier
study, higher activities for photocatalytic rhodamin B degradation
and NOx removal as well as higher photocurrents
were observed for Bi2O2CO3 with dominantly
exposed {001} planes.4 In contrast, remnant
(BiO)4(OH)2CO3 contents exerted a
negative influence on the activity in photocatalytic NOx removal.13 This renders
deeper insights into the formation and thermal decomposition processes
of Bi2O2CO3 essential for the optimization
and targeted exploration of this multifunctional material.

Furthermore,
the enhanced photocatalytic properties of Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 heterojunctions
are in the focus of recent research activities.21−23 The majority
of these composites were formed after several hours of thermal treatment
of Bi2O2CO3 in the range between
300 and 400 °C,21−23 which gives rise to partial or full conversion into
β-Bi2O3.24 α-Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 heterojunctions
are less common in comparison, and only recently was their formation
observed in the above temperature range, namely at 350 °C.25 Generally, the reported temperature windows
for the transformation sequence Bi2O2CO3 → β-Bi2O3 → α-Bi2O3 vary significantly between studies (cf. survey
in Tables S1 and S2). This sheds interesting light on the particle size dependence of
the β-Bi2O3 → α-Bi2O3 phase transition that was first mentioned several decades
ago26 and remains a subject of current
studies, which also revealed the influence of surface carbonate formation
on the phase stability.27 Further investigations
are thus required to establish reliable fabrication conditions for
specific heterojunction types.

In situ diffraction studies are
perfectly suited for growth-dependent
parameter studies because they permit a most direct monitoring of
nanomaterial formation processes.28−34 Therefore, we applied time-resolved powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
to acquire detailed insight into the reaction mechanism involved in
the room-temperature formation of Bi2O2CO3. Special emphasis was placed on the impact of the molecular
environment, namely pH value and CO2 partial pressure,
on the formation pathways of Bi2O2CO3 nanoparticles. Moreover, we demonstrate that the choice of starting
materials and the preparative history exert a significant effect on
the Bi2O2CO3 → β-Bi2O3 → α-Bi2O3 transition sequence.

Results and Discussion
In Situ PXRD Monitoring
of Bi2O2CO3 Formation
pH-Dependent
three-dimensional stack plots
of in situ PXRD patterns monitoring the formation of bismuth oxycarbonate
at room temperature are shown in Figure 1. The Bragg reflections of the initial PXRD
pattern can be assigned to the β-Bi2O3 precursor, with maximum intensity for the (201) reflection.

Figure 1 Time-dependent
PXRD patterns monitoring the reaction of β-Bi2O3 in a Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer
solution at different pH values (top: pH 8, middle:
pH 10, and bottom: pH 12).

At pH 8 and 10, the intensity of this Bragg reflection clearly
decreases with time during the reaction with the buffer solution.
In contrast, the intensities of all Bragg reflections remain almost
constant at pH 12, thus indicating that no conversion of the starting
material takes place at this pH value. Figure 2 compares the temporal evolution of the normalized
(201) intensity of the Bi2O3 precursor at pH
8 and 10.

Figure 2 Temporal evolution of the relative intensity of the (201) and (103)
Bragg reflections of the β-Bi2O3 and Bi2O2CO3 phases, respectively, at pH 8
and 10.

The intensity of the (201) reflection
decreases very rapidly at
pH 10 and reaches its end offset at around 12.5% of the initial intensity.
In contrast, we observed an almost ideal monoexponential decay of
the normalized (201) intensity with a lifetime of 161 ± 1 min
at pH 8 (see Figure S1).

At pH 10,
the decay of this Bragg reflection clearly does not exhibit
such monoexponential kinetics. Furthermore, we observed a nearly complete
conversion of the β-Bi2O3 starting material
at pH 10. These different decays of the (201) reflection intensity
clearly indicate a pH dependence of the reaction mechanism.

Additionally, the growth of additional Bragg reflections assigned
to Bi2O2CO335 was monitored while the reaction proceeded further at pH 8 and 10,
respectively. The most intense (103) reflection of Bi2O2CO3 and the (213) reflection of the (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 intermediate display rather close d-spacings of 2.948 and 3.0296 Å, respectively.35

A full pattern fitting was not taken into
account for several reasons.
First, a complete crystal structure determination of the intermediate
phase (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 has not been
reported to date. Second, the reflections which are most likely arising
from this intermediate are low in intensity and quite broadened. Third,
the background intensity is not constant and increases while the reaction
proceeds.

At pH 8, the in situ PXRD patterns displayed a minor
contribution
of the intermediate (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 phase, which appeared as a weak reflection during the early stages
of the reaction and then as a shoulder of the growing (103) reflection
of the Bi2O2CO3 product (see Figure 3). Minor contributions
of the hydroxide intermediate can be as well observed at pH 10 (see Figure 3). The temporal evolution
of the (103) Bi2O2CO3 reflection
at pH 8 reveals a sigmoidal growth (see Figure 2), whereas the growth of the (103) reflection
at pH 10 follows more complex kinetics. Surprisingly, the intensity
of this reflection is still rising after the decay of the (201) β-Bi2O3 reflection already reached its end offset. This
behavior might be explained by the presence of an amorphous intermediate
or by the formation of Bi2O2CO3 from
solvated Bi3+ ions. Both hypotheses are in line with the
higher background of the PXRD patterns recorded at pH 10 (see Figure 3). The kinetics of
the formation of Bi2O2CO3 was evaluated
by standard procedures.36,37 Detailed information
on the kinetics of the crystallization process can be obtained by
applying the well-known Avrami equation38−40 4  α represents the value of the extent
of reaction at a given time. This value can be calculated from the
intensity of a Bragg reflection (hkl) according to
α(t) = Ihkl(t)/Ihkl(t∞), where Ihkl(t) is the intensity of the Bragg reflection at the time t and Ihkl(t∞) represents the final intensity after the reaction has run to completion. k represents the rate constant in eq 4, and the exponent n is determined
to differentiate between different reaction mechanisms.41 The value of n is most easily
visualized through Sharp–Hancock plots on the basis of the
following expression42 5  A
linear Sharp–Hancock plot indicates
that the reaction mechanism remains unchanged throughout the entire
reaction time.

Figure 3 (103) Bragg reflection of Bi2O2CO3 for different reaction times (top: pH 8, bottom: pH 10, green
vertical
bar: (213) reflection of (BiO)4(OH)2CO3, blue vertical bar: (103) reflection of Bi2O2CO3).

The Sharp–Hancock
plots for the (103) reflection of Bi2O2CO3 are shown in Figure 4. For the formation process
at pH 8, the Sharp–Hancock plot exhibits linear behavior with
a slope of 1.12 ± 0.02 over the 0.2 < α < 0.85 range.
These results can be interpreted with the model for a zero-dimensional
nucleation, where no diffusion control occurs. In contrast to the
zero-dimensional behavior at pH 8, the Sharp–Hancock plot at
pH 10 suggests the presence of two mechanisms.

Figure 4 Sharp–Hancock
plot for the growth of the (103) Bragg reflection
of Bi2O2CO3 at pH 8 (black squares)
and at pH 10 (red circles) over the range 0.2 < α < 0.85.

The reaction exponent n increases from 0.39 ±
0.01 to 1.04 ± 0.06, thereby indicating an initial diffusion-controlled
reaction mechanism up to a reaction time of ∼285 min.

Ex Situ
Analysis of Bi2O2CO3 Growth
Figure 5 compares
representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of the β-Bi2O3 precursor and Bi2O2CO3 samples obtained at pH 8, 10,
and 12. The commercially available β-Bi2O3 precursor (Sigma-Aldrich) consists of spherical and sheet-like particles
with a diameter of 100–300 nm (Figure 5a). Related irregular morphologies of Bi2O2CO3 were obtained after the reactions
at pH 8 and 10. In line with the PXRD monitoring (Figure 1), the spherical and sheet-like
precursor particles were retained at pH 12.

Figure 5 Representative SEM images
of (a) Bi2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich)
and products obtained at different pH values: (b) pH 8, (c) pH 10,
and (d) pH 12.

Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy provide
additional evidence for the formation of Bi2O2CO3 at pH 8 and 10 (see Figure 6). At pH 12, no significant differences between
the spectra of the precursor and of a representative sample obtained
after 10 h reaction time can be observed.

Figure 6 FT-IR (top) and Raman
(bottom) spectra of products obtained at
different pH values after 10 h vs β-Bi2O3 precursor.

In particular, the Raman
spectrum of the sample after treatment
with carbonate buffer at pH 12 is virtually identical to the precursor
spectrum. This corresponds to the results from in situ PXRD and ex
situ SEM which both point to a reaction parameter window between pH
8 and 10 for Bi2O2CO3 formation.

The FT-IR spectra of reaction products at pH 8 and 10 show a clear
intensity increase of the out-of-plane bending vibration of the carbonate
anion at 845 cm–1, thereby corroborating the CO2 uptake process during the reaction.35,43 Raman spectra of samples obtained at pH 8 and 10 display the growth
of new bands in the spectral region 840–1100 cm–1, which can be assigned to the normal modes of the CO32–. The most intense Raman band at 1067 cm–1 corresponds to the symmetric carbonate stretch motion.35,43

Quenching experiments were performed using the same experimental
conditions as those for the synchrotron experiments to correlate the
pH dependency and kinetic trends emerging from the in situ X-ray diffraction
(XRD) monitoring with the parameter window for Bi2O2CO3 formation under ex situ conditions.

A
summary evaluation of the PXRD patterns obtained from quenching
the reaction after different durations (0.5–12 h) at different
pH values (8, 9, 10, 11, and 12) can be found in Table S3. The quenching resulted in similar PXRD patterns
for samples obtained in the pH range 8–11 (see Figure S2). The starting material (β-Bi2O3) was gradually converted into Bi2O2CO3. The evaluation of the educt/product
ratio through PXRD refinement after 0.5 and 4 h at pH 10 showed that
only 30 and 7% of the educt remained, respectively. This appears considerably
faster when compared with the values obtained from the in situ measurements
(Figure 1, 50 and 20%,
respectively). However, a direct comparison between these values remains
difficult because the continuation of the reaction with atmospheric
CO2 and humidity after quenching cannot totally be excluded.
At pH 12, the ex situ reaction behavior changes drastically. The reflections
of the starting material dominate the patterns from start to finish
(see Figure S3), and only traces of Bi2O2CO3 can be observed. These findings
are in good agreement with the present in situ results. Additionally,
small amounts of (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 are
formed at pH 12. Interestingly, only (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 was formed after a further pH increase to 13.

When comparing the notably different time scales for Bi2O2CO3 formation under in situ and ex situ conditions
with identical amounts of starting material and reaction containers,
a possible influence of 60 keV in situ X-ray irradiation on the nucleation
process might also be taken into account.44,45

Influence of the Preparative History on Bismuth Oxide Phase
Transformations
To assess the potential of room-temperature-synthesized
Bi2O2CO3 for targeted access to selective
Bi2O3 modifications or to Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 heterojunctions,
its thermal decomposition behavior was studied with several methods.
For this purpose, phase pure Bi2O2CO3 was synthesized according to literature procedures to exclude any
precursor traces.11

First, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) data (see Figure S4) showed
the decomposition of Bi2O2CO3 to
Bi2O3 above 300 °C, in line with earlier
reports.35,43 The temperature interval for the conversion
of Bi2O2CO3 into α- or β-Bi2O3, respectively, was first narrowed down with
ex situ thermal decomposition experiments through heat treatment under
ambient conditions in the range of 240–340 °C (Table S4). Decomposition of Bi2O2CO3 to β-Bi2O3 proceeds
between 240 and 260 °C, followed by transformation into α-Bi2O3 between 300 and 320 °C. This temperature
window was then compared to the β- to α-phase transformation
temperature range for commercially available β-Bi2O3. Interestingly, the phase change of the commercially
purchased starting material was observed at a significantly lower
temperature, namely around 260 °C (Table S4).

To substantiate these ex situ results, both home-made
Bi2O2CO3 and commercial β-Bi2O3 were subjected to high-temperature powder X-ray
diffraction
(HT-PXRD) monitoring. PXRD patterns were recorded every 5 °C
after a holding time of 30 min at a constant temperature in air.

Decomposition of Bi2O2CO3 (Figure 7) was observed at
around 260 °C in good agreement with the above ex situ measurements.
Likewise, the subsequent transformation of β- to α-Bi2O3 (Figure S6) took
place at a similar temperature interval as recorded ex situ (320–340
°C), and traces of the α-phase could already be observed
at 325 °C.

Figure 7 HT-PXRD monitoring between 225 and 280 °C showing
the decomposition
of Bi2O2CO3 to β-Bi2O3 (cf. also Figure S6).

Next, the unexpectedly low transformation
temperature of commercially
available β-Bi2O3 (β-Bi2O3(a), Table 1) was confirmed by high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) measurements.
First reflections of α-Bi2O3 indeed appeared
at 260 °C. Their intensity increased constantly with temperature
until completely phase pure α-Bi2O3 was
obtained at 290 °C (Figure S7).

Previous
works established links between the particle size of bismuth
oxide nanomaterials and their respective phase diagrams.27,46,47 To further investigate the influence
of preparative history and particle size on the notably different
β- to α-transformation points of the two Bi2O3 source materials, we isolated phase pure β-Bi2O3 (PXRD in Figure S8) through decomposition of Bi2O2CO3 at 300 °C (β-Bi2O3(b), Table 1). Here, the phase
change to α-Bi2O3 occurred after heat
treatment at 320–340 °C.

Surprisingly, it was not
possible to monitor the phase transformation
of commercial β-Bi2O3 to α-Bi2O3 with differential thermal analysis (DTA) methods
although a wide range of heating rates was applied (1–10 K/min
in argon and air). The transformation enthalpy of the phase transition
has been reported within a range between −9 and −4 kJ/mol,
which is rather low and can easily be overlooked in a DTA measurement.26,48

The particle sizes and morphologies of as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b–d) and commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) were investigated with SEM, transmission
electron microscopy
(TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and Scherrer-equation
analysis (see Figures 8, S10, and Table 1). On the basis of the Scherrer-equation
analysis using the full width at half-maximum of the (201) main reflection,
we estimated a crystallite size for β-Bi2O3(a) and the as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) of
78 ± 2 and 60 ± 1 nm, respectively.49 BET measurements also show closely related specific surface areas
of 3 m2/g for both samples. SEM images of as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) and commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) are compared in Figure 8. SEM images of as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) show microspheres ranging from 1 to 3 μm diameter together
with some smaller
spheres that are strongly agglomerated. However, TEM images of as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) show particles with smaller sizes.
On the basis of SEM and TEM results, commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) consists of nanospheres with diameters
of 100–200 nm. Table 1 provides a summary of the characterization and phase transformation
behavior of all starting materials investigated in the present study.

Figure 8 (a) Representative
SEM image of as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) (from
Bi(NO3)3 precursor, material
coated with 10 nm Pt), (b) SEM image of commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) (material coated with 10 nm Pt), (c)
TEM image of as-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) (from
Bi(NO3)3 precursor), and (d) TEM image of commercially
available β-Bi2O3(a).

In summary, despite SEM results showing microspheres for
the as-synthesized
β-Bi2O3, PXRD evidence does not indicate
significant differences in the crystallite size of the as-synthesized
sample β-Bi2O3(b) and commercially available β-Bi2O3(a). The observed discrepancy in the SEM
results can be due to agglomeration, which is also visible in the
TEM images (see Figure 8). The grain boundaries expected in the SEM images of β-Bi2O3(b) are probably concealed by the 10 nm Pt layer applied during
sample preparation. Therefore, we assume that the significantly lower
phase transition temperature for the β → α transition
of β-Bi2O3(a) is most likely not a size effect.

Therefore, additional experiments were conducted with ultrapure
starting materials to exclude possible influences of impurities on
the β → α transition temperature. For this purpose,
the Bi2O2CO3 precursor was prepared
via two different routes, namely either by reaction of commercial
β-Bi2O3 in Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer solution over night or by the coprecipitation
method with Bi(NO3)3 and Na2CO3 as starting materials. Both synthesis routes yielded phase
pure Bi2O2CO3. All materials were
placed in the same muffle furnace and heated to 300 °C for 2
h vs commercial β-Bi2O3(a) as a reference.
PXRD measurements of the three samples were conducted after cooling
down to room temperature. The two Bi2O2CO3 samples obtained by different synthesis routes both yielded
β-Bi2O3 after heat treatment, whereas
α-Bi2O3 was obtained from commercial β-Bi2O3(a).

In summary, all β-Bi2O3 samples (b–d) synthesized
using carbonate salts afforded materials
with higher β → α phase transformation temperatures
compared with commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) (Table 1). This phenomenon
might be linked to the presence of stabilizing carbonate groups on
the surface of the respective β-Bi2O3 samples
along the lines of previous studies.27 Attempts
to synthesize β-Bi2O3 via a carbonate-free
route did not work and only resulted in the direct formation of phase
pure α-Bi2O3 instead.50 Given that the analytical characterizations (Table 1) show neither drastic differences
in the particle sizes nor an indication for a significant role of
impurities, the low β → α phase transformation
temperature for the commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) can be due to the absence of a protective carbonate surface
layer.

To test this hypothesis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS)
measurements were performed to further investigate the surface composition
of β-Bi2O3 powders from different sources (a, b) compared to that of two reference samples, namely Na2CO3 and Bi2O2CO3. Measurements of the C 1s core level emissions give insight into
the relative amount of carbonates present at the surface of the samples
(Figure S11a). All investigated samples
show peaks from adventitious carbon that are commonly observed in
ex situ XPS measurements. In addition to these adsorbate emissions,
strong carbonate peaks are visible for the two reference samples.
In combination with the analysis of the O 1s core level emission (Figure S11b), this unambiguously confirms the
presence of carbonates in these samples. For both the β-Bi2O3(a) and β-Bi2O3(b) samples, the carbonate
components in both C 1s and O 1s spectra are much less pronounced.
This renders the presence of a dense protective carbonate surface
shell unlikely, and only a thin surface layer may be present. However,
given the qualitative nature of the results and the low relative intensity
of the carbonate emissions, no straightforward connection between
carbonate groups on the surface and the different phase transition
temperatures can be made.

The Bi2O3 materials
after different treatments
(Table 1) were stored
in vials in air after all analytics had been conducted. After a few
weeks, we observed a color bleaching from bright yellow (β-Bi2O3) to light beige. Additional PXRD measurements
were performed that showed that substantial amounts of Bi2O2CO3 were now present in the previously phase
pure β-Bi2O3 materials. We concluded that
the β-Bi2O3 had reacted with ambient carbon
dioxide during storage to form Bi2O2CO3. This may arise from residual Bi2O2CO3 precursor amounts acting as seed crystals. To check whether
the formation of Bi2O2CO3 could be
accelerated, we conducted the following reference experiment. As-synthesized β-Bi2O3(b) was exposed to a controlled CO2 rich gas flow (10 mL/min CO2 in argon) at 30 °C
for 60 h in the TGA device. The presence of Bi2O2CO3 after such treatment was confirmed by PXRD measurement
(31% according to Rietveld analysis, Figure S12). Commercially available β-Bi2O3(a) was
exposed to an analogous CO2 gas flow under identical conditions,
but no formation of Bi2O2CO3 was
detected in subsequent PXRD measurements (Figure S12). Because the commercial material also showed surface carbonate
peaks in the XPS measurements, the presumed carbonate seed crystals
are most likely not the sole reason for the carbonate formation. Further
investigations beyond the scope of this study are required to fully
understand the complex parameter dependence of the observed phase
transitions.

All in all, the significant influence of manifold
parameters during
the preparative history is crucial for the targeted phase selective
fabrication of Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 heterojunctions and bismuth oxide materials for different
catalytic applications.

Conclusions
The combination of in
situ PXRD with SEM and vibrational spectroscopy
studies provided deeper insight into the reaction mechanisms of the
room-temperature formation of Bi2O2CO3 as an attractive multifunctional material for CO2 capture
and photocatalysis. The formation mechanisms of Bi2O2CO3 show pronounced pH dependence, with a reaction
window between pH 8 and 10. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction monitoring
clearly indicates that Bi2O2CO3 is
formed via different pathways at pH 8 and 10, respectively. At pH
8, a stronger contribution of the (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 intermediate phase goes hand in hand with a higher
extent of precursor conversion. Sharp–Hancock plots can be
interpreted with a zero-dimensional nucleation model for Bi2O2CO3 growth at pH 8. This scenario is changed
at pH 10: up to a reaction time of ∼285 min, the nucleation
process is in line with a diffusion-controlled model, which then turns
toward zero-dimensional nucleation kinetics. Ex situ quenching experiments
confirmed these trends, albeit with different Bi2O2CO3 formation kinetics compared with in situ monitoring.
The present results indicate that important main trends for formation
parameter windows can be derived from in situ monitoring, which open
up new options for optimizing the production and performance of economic
Bi2O2CO3 catalysts for environmental
applications. Subsequent conversion experiments on the β →
α phase transformation temperature of bismuth oxide samples
from different sources indicate a major influence of the synthetic
protocol. Samples obtained from carbonate-based starting materials
displayed higher transition temperatures to α-Bi2O3 than to commercially available β-Bi2O3 with comparable crystallite size and surface area.
Follow-up studies are under way to fully establish the detailed pH
specific growth mechanisms. Investigations into the role of protective
carbonate surface layers are expected to exploit the preprative history
of bismuth oxide-related precursors as a key parameter for their targeted
transformation into phase pure functional materials, such as catalytically
active heterojunctions.

Experimental Section
The time-resolved
PXRD experiments were performed at the P02 beamline
of the PETRA III storage ring at HASYLAB.51,52 The beamline is operated at a fixed energy of 60 keV with a relative
energy bandwidth ΔE/E of 10–4.51 β-Bi2O3 (20 mg, 42.9 μmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%, PXRD
in Figure S8) was dispersed in 2 mL of
Na2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer solution (100
mM, pH 10) and stirred during the reaction. For the other measurement
series, the pH of the buffer solution was adjusted to 8 and 12 by
adding diluted solutions of HCl and NaOH, respectively. Reactions
were performed in sodium carbonate buffer to mimic a high CO2 partial pressure and to control the pH of the reaction medium. The
applied CO2 concentration is significantly higher compared
to the saturation concentration at atmospheric partial pressure (c = Hcp·pCO2 = 3.34 × 10–2 M/atm ×
3.9 × 10–4 atm = 0.013 mM; Hcp = Henry constant).53 All
samples were placed in polypropylene screw cap tubes for synchrotron
experiments (TPP Techno Plastic Products AG, ø 12 mm).

Room-temperature in situ PXRD patterns were recorded every 30 s
using a fast two-dimensional detector (PerkinElmer XRD1621) at a wavelength
of 0.20751 Å. Background subtraction and radial integration of
the PXRD pattern were performed with the Fit2D software.54 For background subtraction, an XRD pattern of
a sample container filled only with buffer solution was recorded and
this image was subtracted prior to radial integration. CeO2 was used as a calibration standard for the determination of the
beam center. Ex situ FT-IR and Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker
VERTEX 70 spectrometer with a platinum attenuated total reflection
accessory and on a Renishaw Ramascope spectrometer equipped with a
diode laser (785 nm), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy images
were recorded on a SEM Zeiss Supra 50 VP. Prior to measurements, the
samples were coated with 10 nm of Pt. Phase pure Bi2O2CO3 was obtained from a literature procedure.11 TEM investigations were performed with a FEI
Talos F200X (200 kV) high-resolution transmission electron microscope.
Samples were deposited on the 300 mesh copper grid before measurement.

Ex situ room-temperature XRD patterns were recorded on a STOE STADI
P diffractometer in transmission mode (flat-plate sample holder, Ge
monochromator, and Cu Kα1 radiation) using a position-sensitive
microstrip solid-state detector (MYTHEN 1 K). Temperature-dependent
PXRD data on phase pure Bi2O2CO3 were
obtained with a Panalytical X’Pert PRO MPD using a high-temperature
furnace. Cu Kα radiation (1.541874 Å) was generated under
45 kV and 40 mA, sent through a 0.04 rad soller slit, a  divergence slit and a 10 mm wide beam mask
to irradiate the sample. The diffracted beams were collected using
an X’Celerator RTMS detector equipped with a 5 mm antiscatter
and a Ni Kβ-filter. All powder samples were placed on alumina
sample holders that were mounted on a height control stage for micrometer-precise
sample height alignment. Prior to measurements, the sample was centered
within the beam by adjusting the sample holder height so that the
initial intensity was reduced by ∼50%. All measurements were
performed under atmospheric conditions (in air). The temperature-programmed
PXRD experiments were conducted under the following protocol. The
first PXRD pattern was recorded at room temperature prior to any thermal
treatment. Subsequently, the sample was heated to the desired temperatures
(max 400 °C) using a rate of 2 K/min. Then, the temperature was
held for further 30 min to ensure thermal equilibration and the completion
of chemical processes before recording a powder diffractogram in 5
K intervals. After reaching the final temperature, the sample was
allowed to cool down to room temperature and then another pattern
was recorded. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples was
conducted using a Netzsch Jupiter STA 449 F3 TGA in inert atmosphere
(argon).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted
on selected
samples using a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer featuring monochromatic Al Kα radiation, generated
from an electron beam operated at 15 kV and 32.3 W. The energy scale
of the instrument was calibrated using Au and Cu reference samples.
The samples were firmly pressed onto indium foil patches, which were
then mounted onto a sample plate and introduced into the spectrometer.
The analysis was conducted at 1 × 10–6 Pa,
with an electron take off angle of 45° and a pass energy of 23.50
eV for all samples. Charge compensation during the measurement was
achieved using a low-energy electron source. The acquired spectra
were then aligned using the C–C component of the C 1s core
level emission at 284.5 eV.
